            "To determine when this Hip1R\u2013cortactin complex might function during endocytosis, we quantitatively analyzed the temporal appearance of Hip1R and cortactin at endocytic sites. Previous immuno-EM studies revealed that both proteins are present during all stages of CCP formation (Engqvist-Goldstein et al, 2001; Cao et al, 2003). In addition, Hip1R appeared to link actin filaments to CCPs, whereas cortactin was found on actin filaments and actin filament branches throughout the plasma membrane (EngqvistGoldstein et al, 2001; Cao et al, 2003). Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) was performed to image Hip1R-GFP or cortactin-GFP on the surfaces of cells stably expressing DsRed-clathrin (Figure 4). Consistent with previous reports, Hip1R appeared at essentially all of the clathrin patches, whereas cortactin appeared at about onethird of the clathrin patches (Engqvist-Goldstein et al, 2004; Merrifield et al, 2005). We found that Hip1R recruitment follows the course of CCP growth, albeit with a small delay compared to clathrin (Figure 4A, C and E). When a CCP started to disappear, Hip1R behavior was essentially the same as that of clathrin. These observations are consistent with previous observations, but with greater time resolution (Engqvist-Goldstein et al, 2001; Keyel et al, 2004). In contrast, cortactin recruitment was more precipitous, occurring close to the time of CCV formation, and cortactin fluorescence lingered slightly longer after clathrin disappeared (Figure 4B, D and E).",
            "Live cell imaging TIR-FM was performed using an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a \b 60/NA1.45. lens and 488 nm argon ion laser (Melles Griot). The temperature was maintained at 27.51C using a Bioptechs chamber. The 488 nm laser was used to excite both GFP and DsRed. Simultaneous two-color imaging was performed using an image splitter (Optical Insight) to separate the red and green emission signals to two sides of the camera sensor using a 565 nm dichroic mirror, and 530/30 and 630/50 nm emission filters. No bleed-through between the red and the green channel was detected under our conditions. Swiss 3T3 cells that stably express DsRedmLCa (mouse clathrin light chain a) were transiently transfected with Hip1R-GFP or cortactin-GFP using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) 48 h before imaging. Each cell was imaged every 2 s for 200\u2013300 frames. After each experiment, images of immobilized microbeads that fluoresce at both green and red wavelengths were captured.

Bement (University of Wisconsin), was truncated at Glu720, generating a construct containing the motor domain and the only IQ motif (referred to as myo1eIQ throughout the paper). A FLAG peptide sequence was inserted at the C terminus and subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus was generated using standard procedures. Myo1eIQ with bound calmodulin was purified from Sf9 cells that were coinfected with virus containing recombinant myo1eIQ and CaM (Fig. 1). Four liters of log phase cells (2 & 106 cells/ml) were infected and incubated at 27 \u00b0C for 60 h with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; suspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2,5mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin), 2 mM MgATP, and 0.05% Igepal at 4 \u00b0C; and homogenized with five strokes in a Dounce homogenizer.

The Mono Q column separated myo1eIQ from FLAG peptide, ADP, ATP, and free CaM. Fractions containing myo1eIQ were dialyzed versus storage buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 50% glycerol), which concentrated the protein and allowed for storage at $20 \u00b0C. Quantitative densitometry showed that myo1eIQ was (95% pure, and the CaM:myo1eIQ ratio was 1:1. Approximately 2 mg of pure myo1e protein was obtained from 4 liters of cells. (p. 2)",

When biotinTfn uptake was analyzed, a nearly 70% reduction in endocytosis was found in the cells treated with cortactin siRNA (Fig. 2B, left), which is consistent with our previous report (22) and a report from others (23). To determine whether the decrease in Tfn endocytosis was due to the specific loss of cortactin in the siRNA-treated cells, we treated the cells expressing murine cortactin-GFP with HS1 and cortactin siRNAs, respectively. In addition to the endogenous cortactin, the human cortactin siRNA also showed a slight inhibition of the exogenous murine cortactin (Fig. 2B, right), presumably because of the 95% identity between human and mouse mRNAs in the region targeted by the siRNA. Nevertheless, the overall level of exogenous cortactin proteins was greater than or similar to that of the endogenous cortactin of the control cells. At this level cortactin siRNA failed to inhibit Tfn uptake in the cortactinGFP-expressing cells, indicating that cortactin-GFP protein maintains its endocytic function similar to the endogenous cortactin. However, the same cortactin siRNA retained inhibitory activity for Tfn uptake in the cells expressing either mutant Cort-F-GFP or Cort\u0003SH3GFP (Fig. 2B)."

CME events imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy showed a buildup of clathrin fluorescence that reached a plateau before a burst of dynamin preceded the site\u2019s disappearance, as previously described (8, 10)(Fig.1,Band C, and movies S1 and S2).",

The first\u2014derived from electron microscopy images showing both relatively flat and invaginated clathrin lattices in cells\u2014suggests that clathrin assembles as a planar lattice that subsequently bends as the membrane invaginates (6) (Fig. 1A). For this to happen, complex rearrangements within the clathrin network must occur during budding. The second model avoids this difficulty by proposing that large, flat clathrin lattices are not precursors of CME and that, at sites of CME, clathrin directly assembles to produce the curved coat as the membrane invaginates (7)(Fig.1A)."

The core tracking program (based on the software package m-track) automatically identifies fluorescent spots and connects them as tracks by minimizing the linear assignment problem (Jaqaman et al., 2008). We used stringent tracking parameters with gap size 0 and search radius 0\u20132.3 pixels (248 nm). GFP and RFP tracks with high variability in the intensity/time profile were automatically rejected (Ferguson et al., 2017) as well as tracks \u0014 3 s in duration (Dambournet et al., 2018) and the remaining tracks were associated spatiotemporally according to a cost matrix (Hong et al., 2015). We used two track rejection schemes. In the first, users were presented with fluorescence montages and XY coordinates of the tracks to assess the fidelity of tracking for each event (Hong et al., 2015). In the second, tracks were automatically rejected based signal-to-noise ratio (>1.05) and proximity to neighboring tracks (>525 nm) (Hong et al., 2015). We checked that the manual and automatic track rejection schemes yielded similar results (lifetime distributions and intensity versus time plots) as well as to manual, kymographbased quantification of lifetimes (below). From the above workflow (Dambournet et al., 2018) we increased throughput by connecting all steps into an automated tracking pipeline requiring minimal user input. For SK-MEL-2 cells expressing CLTA-RFP and DNM2-GFP, we tracked regions that were not near the nucleus (which has a concentration of Golgi-derived clathrin budding) and that did not have large, bright, persistent structures containing invariant RFP and GFP signals (\u2018plaques,\u2019 which are likely sites of adhesion).

The sample includes 2,705,431 patent\u2013inventor observations assigned to 396,336 unique inventors and 46,880 unique firms, accounting for 473,419 unique inventor\u2013firm pairs. (p. 5)",

We rely on all classes assigned to a patent rather than just the primary class. Exploring new fields is a binary indicator that equals one in the absence of any overlapping class between all prior patents and the focal patent. (p. 6)",

Performance on such creative thinking tasks has been shown to predict both academic*' and creative achievement. In the divergent thinking task, the child was asked to draw as many different drawings as possible from one imposed abstract form (i.e, incomplete shape), within 10 min. The final score was the sum of all valid drawings. In the convergent thinking task, the child had to select three different abstract forms out of eight to create an original drawing that combined them, within 15 min. Three blind judges scored the drawings for originality following the EPoC scoring manual (inter-rater agreement; Krippendorff's alpha = 0.905). Independent t tests were computed on each creativity score (divergent and convergent) to test for between-group differences.

Children spoke their responses out loud, which were recorded (and later transcribed) by an experimenter. For each child, fluency data was preprocessed using the SemNA pipeline in R.

            "we select all U.S. inventors who patented in Michigan or in another nonenforcing state before the passing of MARA in 1985, including Alaska, California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Washington, and West Virginia (Malsberger 1996; Marx et al. 2009, Marx et al. 2015). Inventors who did not patent in a nonenforcing state or only did so after the passing of MARA are excluded to ensure that MARA did not affect sample selection. We track all subsequent patents linked to this set of inventors and assigned to a \ufb01rm and identify each move between \ufb01rms (again, the design relies upon inventors patenting at least twice). Only intrastate moves are taken into account because inventors can emigrate from Michigan to a nonenforcing state to avoid a lawsuit (Marx et al. 2015). Finally, we restrict the analysis to the 1975\u20131995 period, that is, 10 years before and after the passing of MARA. Notice that we collect all patents, both before and after MARA and in and out of Michigan. This results in the full sample of patents by inventors at risk for moving between \ufb01rms both in Michigan and elsewhere before and after MARA. The resulting data set spans 21 years and consists of 29,956 inventors and 162,586 patents of which 13,723 patents represent a move, that is, the \ufb01rst subsequent patent of an inventor after moving to a new \ufb01rm. The \ufb01nal analysis is restricted to these mobile inventors because the pressure to explore new \ufb01elds because of MARA only affects inventors who move between \ufb01rms.",
            "In 1985, MARA was passed with the intention of harmonizing state law with the uniform state antitrust act (Bullard 1985). However, while passing MARA, legislators unintentionally revoked statute 445.761, which prohibited the enforcement of noncompete agreements in Michigan (Alterman 1985). After the passing of MARA, employers in Michigan suddenly obtained the legal means to prevent their ex-employees from working in the same \ufb01eld at a different \ufb01rm (Marx et al. 2009). As such, the Michigan experiment provided an exogenous pressure on inventors to explore new \ufb01elds after they left their former employer.",
            "To estimate the effect of exploring new \ufb01elds on the novelty and value of invention, we use a two-stage least square model (2SLS). Because the endogenous variable is binary, we use the approach suggested by Angrist (2001) and Angrist and Pischke (2008). For a recent application of the approach, see Galasso and Schankerman (2015). First, we estimate the likelihood of exploring new fields with a logit model in a difference-in-differences configuration. We include the interaction between Michigan and postmara as an exogenous variable capturing the effect of the policy reversal. Using logit instead of OLS in the \ufb01rst stage results in a better \ufb01t. Second, we calculate the \ufb01tted probabilities of exploring new fields and use these nonlinear fitted values bound between zero and one as an instrument for exploring new fjelds in the 2SLS models. Using nonlinear fitted values as an instrument is the same as plugging in \ufb01tted values when the first stage is estimated by OLS, but the advantage is a better predictor of exploring new fields in the first stage (Angrist and Pischke 2008). The 2SLS model uses a single instrument, resulting in just-identified estimates. Standard errors are clustered at the inventor level to control for repeated observations. (p. 12)",
            "For each inventor-patent observation, we identify whether there is any overlap between the three-digit technology classes of the focal patent and the three-digit technology classes linked to all prior patents of the coinventors on the patent (excluding the focal inventor). Expert team is a binary indicator that equals one if at least one of the coinventors has a prior patent in the same class(es) as the focal patent. The measure is used a moderator to test whether collaboration with experts reduces the negative effect of exploring new fields on value. (p. 6)",
            "To assess patent value, we calculate forward citations (ln) as the logarithmic trans-formation of one plus the number of times a patent is referenced as prior art within 10 years. (p. 6)",
            "Our identi\ufb01cation relies on the fact that only mobile inventors residing in Michigan after the passing of MARA are affected; Michigan inventors before MARA and inventors from other states before and after MARA are not affected by the policy change. Therefore, we can combine differences in exploring new \ufb01elds between inventors from different states (Michigan versus nonMichigan) with differences between cohorts induced by the timing of MARA (pre- versus post-MARA). The interaction between binary indicators for Michigan residence and post-MARA is expected to have a positive signi\ufb01cant effect on the likelihood of exploring new \ufb01elds. Thus, this difference-in-differences (DD) can be used as an instrument for exploring new \ufb01elds (Du\ufb02o 2001). The DD speci\ufb01cation controls for overall time trends in exploring new \ufb01elds (across all states) and for time-invariant unobserved differences between Michigan and non-Michigan inventors (Angrist and Pischke 2008). Furthermore, regression DD allows us to include additional inventor and \ufb01eld characteristics affecting the likelihood of exploring new \ufb01elds as controls. The main assumption is that, in the absence of MARA, the trend in exploring new \ufb01elds would not have been systematically different between Michigan and nonMichigan mobile inventors. (p. 12)"
