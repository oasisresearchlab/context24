The grpE Protein of Escherichia coli PURIFICATION AND PROPERTIES * ( Received for publication , March 30 , 1987 ) Maciej ZyliczS , Debbie Angg , and Costa Georgopoulos From the Department of Cellular , Viral , and Molecular Biology , Medical Center , University of Utah , Salt Lake City , Utah 84132 ThegrpE gene of Escherichia coli was first identified because a mutation in it , grpE280 , prevented bacteri - ophage X DNA replication in vivo . Subsequent work resulted in the identification of the grpE protein in two - dimensional gels and its classification as a heat shock protein . Here we report the purification of the grpE protein . We show that overproduction of grpE occurs in dnaK103 bacteria which do not produce a functional M , 72 , 000 dnaK protein . The grpE protein was purified from this strain primarily by its specific retention on a dnaK affinity column . The interaction between these two proteins , which is stable in the presence of 2 M KCl , allowed other proteins to be washed from this column . grpE was then eluted by ATP , which disrupts the interaction . During purifica - tion , grpE activity was monitored by its ability to complement an in vitro Xdv DNA replication system dependent on the X 0 and XP proteins . The effect of ATP on the dnaK - grpE complex was also observed during sedimentation of the two proteins in glycerol gradients . Purified grpE protein has a M , of approximately 23 , 000 under both denaturing and native conditions , as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedi - mentation , respectively . However , in the presence of dnaK under native conditions , grpE cosediments with dnaK . When ATP is added to the gradient , the complex is disrupted , and the two proteins sediment independ - ently as monomers . Bacteriophage X DNA replication is a prime example of viral dependence on the host replication proteins , both at the level of initiation and elongation ( reviewed in Refs . 1 and 2 ) . Bacteriophage X encodes two replication proteins , X 0 and XP , which are responsible for accurate initiation at the cis - acting orih site on the X genome . In addition , several Escherichia coli proteins are required for X DNA initiation . These genes encoding the dnaK , dnaJ , and grpE proteins were originally identified by host mutations which prevented X DNA repli - cation at any temperature ( 2 ) . Subsequently , these genes were also shown to be essential for host growth at high temperature ( 3 - 7 ) . Bacteria carrying mutations in these three genes exhibit similar pleiotropic effects at the nonpermissive temperature , * This work was supported in part by Grants GM23917 and AI21029 from the National Institutes of Health ( to C .

I Supported by National Institutes of Health Training Grant which include a decrease in the rate of synthesis of both DNA and RNA ( 7 - 10 ) . An additional interesting feature of dnaK , dnaJ , and grpE is that they belong to the so - called heat shock class of proteins ( reviewed in Refs . 2 and 11 ; Refs . 7 , 12 , and 13 ) . That is , their rate of synthesis is transiently increased upon a shift - up in temperature . In this article , we describe the purification of the grpE protein . This procedure is dependent upon the fortuitous discovery of an extremely stable interaction between the grpE and dnaK proteins under conditions of high salt which can be disrupted in the presence of ATP . As a consequence , a one - column purification scheme using a dnaK affinity column was employed . grpE activity was monitored using an in vitro X DNA replication assay , as described previously ( 14 ) . A crude cell extract , Fraction I1 ( 15 ) , has been shown to support oriX - specific DNA replication if supplemented with the X 0 and XP proteins ( 16 - 18 ) . grpE activity was assayed by complemen - tation of a Fraction I1 extract prepared from grpE 280 bacteria . MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial Strains and Plasmid - The bacterial strains C600 , C600grpE280 , and C600dnuK756 , have been described previously ( 4 , 7 , 12 , 14 ) . Strain C600dnaK103 was obtained from Dr . Kaspar von Meyenburg ( Department of Microbiology , The Technical University of Denmark ) and shown by us to be an allele of the dnaK gene . ’ Strain C600 ( tacl2HhtpR + ) overproduces htpR protein under the control of the tac promoter . ’ Media , Growth , and Storage of Celk - Bacteria were grown in L - broth ( 1 % tryptone , 0 . 5 % yeast extract , 0 . 5 % NaCI , pH 7 . 4 ) supple - mented with 0 . 2 % glucose . The bacterial cultures were centrifuged in a Beckman JA - 10 rotor at 7000 rpm for 10 min at 0 “C ; the bacterial pellets were rinsed with 10 % ( w / v ) sucrose in 50 mM Tris / HCl ( Sigma ) , pH 8 , and stored at - 70°C . Nucleic Acids and X DNA Replication Enzymes - DNA from plas - mid pRLM4 ( which carries oriX ) ( kindly provided by Dr . Roger McMacken , Department of Biochemistry , The Johns Hopkins Uni - versity School of Hygiene and Public Health ) was prepared as pre - viously described ( 19 ) and used as the substrate for in vitro X DNA replication . The X 0 and XP proteins were purified from a strain carrying the plasmid pMY17 - 3 ( ZO ) , which overproduces both proteins ( kindly provided by Dr . Kenichi Matsubara , Laboratory of Molecular Ge - netics , Osaka University Medical School , Osaka , Japan ) . The purifi - cation of the two proteins has been previously described ( 19 , 21 ) . Preparation of Crude Cell Extracts - Fraction I1 extracts were pre - pared from C600 and CSOOgrpE280 bacteria grown at 37 “C to ASg6 nm = 1 . 0 . The Fraction I1 extracts were prepared as previously described ( 22 ) . Replication Assay - The Xdu replication assay was a modified ver - sion of that described in Ref . 22 . The 25 - pI ( final volume ) assay mixture contained 1 . 5 pl of 12 mg / ml bovine serum albumin ( Sigma ) G . N . Chandresekhar and C . Georgopoulos , unpublished results . K . Tilly and C .

Reactions were incubated at 30 " C for 20 min , stopped , and counted as previously described ( 14 , 23 ) . One unit of activity is defined as the incorporation of 1 pmol of nucleotides in 1 min at 30 " C under conditions in which the rate of incorporation is linear with respect to the amount of protein added . Buffers - Buffer A contained 10 % ( w / v ) sucrose ( Mallinckrodt Chemical Works ) , 50 mM Tris / HCl ( Sigma ) , pH 8 ; Buffer B contained 25 mM Hepes ( Sigma ) / KOH , pH 8 , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM 2 - mercap - toethanol ( Sigma ) , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol ; Buffer C contained 25 mM Hepes / KOH , pH 8 , 50 mM KC1 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM 2 - mercapto - ethanol , 20 % ( v / v ) glycerol ; Buffer D contained 20 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 20 mM NaCI , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 15 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , 3 mM MgClz ; and Buffer E contained 25 mM Hepes / KOH , pH 8 , 100 mM NaCI , 5 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol . Protein Determination - The protein concentration was estimated using the Bio - Rad protein assay . A solution of a known concentration of bovine serum albumin was used as a standard . Gel Electrophoresis - One - dimensional gel electrophoresis was per - formed essentially as described by O ' Farrell ( 24 ) . Slab gels of 12 . 5 % ( w / v ) SDS - polyacrylamide were used . Preparation of a dnaKAffinity Column - dnaK protein was purified in a manner analogous to that described for its eukaryotic analog , hsp70 ( 25 ) . Essentially , C600 bacteria which bear the dnaK - over - producingplasmid pMOB45dnaK ' were grown and lysed as described previously ( 14 ) . Following a preliminary separation on a DE52 - cellulose column ( Whatman ) , relevant fractions were passed over a 5 - ml ATP - agarose affinity column ( 1 X 7 cm ) ( C - 8 linkage , Sigma A - 2767 ) equilibrated with Buffer D . The column was washed with 500 mM NaCl in Buffer D . After re - equilibration of the column with Buffer D , the dnaK protein was eluted with 10 mM ATP in Buffer D , adjusted to pH 7 . 6 . The protein was then dialyzed against Buffer E . ' Affi - Gel 10 affinity support ( Bio - Rad ) was cross - linked to purified dnaK protein according to the procedure described by Formosa et al . ( 26 ) . Approximately 100 mg of dnaK protein ( 20 ml ) was combined with 20 ml of Affi - Gel 10 . The protein was bound with an efficiency of approximately 85 % . Amino - terminal Analysis - The amino - terminal sequencing of pu - rified grpE protein was done in the laboratory of Dr . W . Gray ( Department of Biology , University of Utah ) . The stepwise degrada - tion ( 27 ) was carried out in a Beckman 890 D spinning cup instrument using a 1 M Quadrol program . 3 - Phenyl - 2 - thiohydantoin - derivatives were identified by high performance liquid chromatography on a column ( 0 . 46 X 15 cm ) of Ultrasphere ODS using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0 . 05 M sodium acetate , pH 4 . 5 . RESULTS Ouerproduction of grpE Protein - We had shown earlier that the grpE protein of E . coli is a heat shock protein ( 7 ) since a shift - up in temperature from 30 to 43 " C results in a transient increase in its rate of synthesis . We had also shown that the dnaK protein , which is the E . coli analog of the hsp70 protein of Drosophila ( 13 ) , is a negative modulator of the heat shock response ( 28 ) because ( a ) dnaK756 bacteria overproduced heat shock proteins at 30 " C and failed to turn off the heat shock response at 43 " C , and ( b ) overproduction of dnaK protein dampened the magnitude of the heat shock response . We took advantage of this information and asked whether various dnaK - mutants overproduced grpE activity at 30 " C . To do this , we assayed ammonium sulfate fractions prepared from various mutant strains for Xdu in vitro replication as The abbreviations used are : Hepes , N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - ethane - N ' - 2 - sulfonic acid ; SDS , sodium dodecyl sulfate ; NTP , ribo - nucleoside triphosphate .

An in vitro Xdu DNA replication system utilizing a Fraction I1 prepared from C6OOgrpE280 mutant bacteria was carried out as described under " Materials and Methods . " Crude ammonium sulfate fractions from the different mutant strains listed below were prepared as described in the legend of Table I . These were used to complement Xdu DNA replication for the missing grpE activity . The protein concentration of these fractions was in the range where DNA synthesis is proportional to the protein concentration of the comple - menting fraction . Aliquots of 25 p1 were removed at the indicated times and immediately precipitated with 10 % trichloroacetic acid and 50 pl of saturated sodium pyrophosphate as described previously ( 14 , 23 ) . Incorporation of [ 3H ] dNTP precursors into Xdu DNA was ap - proximately 10 pmol / 20 min when the extract was not supplemented with wild - type grpE protein . 0 , C600dnaK103 ; 0 , C600dnaK756 ; V , C600 ( tacl2htpR + plasmid ) ; V , C600 ; 0 , C6OOgrpE280 . describedpreviously ( 22 ) . As a control , we also assayed a wild - type strain transformed with an htpR + - bearing plasmid * in which the htpR + ( rpoH ) gene is under tucl2H promoter control . The htpR gene encodes a u factor of RNA polymerase which is required for transcription of heat shock promoters ( 29 ) . As shown in Fig . 1 , a Fraction I1 prepared from a grpE280 mutant did not support Xdu replication . Crude ammonium sulfate fractions from the various bacterial strains mentioned above were used to complement the grpE280 Fraction I1 extracts for Xdu DNA replication . From the data presented in Fig . 1 , it is clear that extracts from the two dnuK - mutants and the htpR - overproducing strain contain substantially more grpE activity than that of the corresponding wild - type strain , confirming and extending our previous observations ( 28 ) . We chose to purify the grpE activity from the dnaK103 strain for two reasons . ( a ) Of the four strains assayed , dnaKl03 showed the greatest overexpression of grpE activity , and ( b ) immu - noprecipitation of a dnuK103 cell extract with rabbit anti - dnaK antibody resulted in precipitation of only low levels of an unstable , truncated protein , ' suggesting that no full - length dnaK protein is made in dnaK103 bacteria . As developed below , this is important because the purification of the grpE protein depends upon its ability to bind strongly and specifi - cally to a dnaK affinity column . Thus , in the dnaK103 mu - tant , no functional dnaK protein is present to compete with the dnaK affinity column for binding of the grpE protein . Purification of the grpE Protein - Initially , we tested to see whether the grpE protein could be specifically retained on a variety of columns including phenyl - agarose , L - leucine - aga - rose , octyl - agarose , hydroxylapatite , and Affi - Gel blue . The presence of the grpE protein was monitored by ( a ) its ability to complement a Fraction I1 extract prepared from grpE280 bacteria in the in vitro Ado replication assay , and ( b ) its Escherichia coli grpE Protein 17439 presence following electrophoresis on SDS - polyacrylamide gels . None of these columns provided us with a good purifi - cation step ( data not shown ) . We have shown earlier that immunoprecipitation of [ 35S ] methionine - labeled proteins from extracts of heat - shocked cells with rabbit anti - dnaK antibody results in precipitation of the M , 72 , 000 dnaK pro - tein and an approximately M , 23 , 000 protein ( 47 ) . Immuno - precipitation of extracts from dnuKlO3 mutants did not result in precipitation of either the M , 72 , 000 dnaK or M , 23 , 000 protein . ' The M , 23 , 000 protein was subsequently shown to possess the same isoelectric point as a protein encoded by a AgrpE ' transducing phage which complements in vivo the grpE280 mutation ( 7 , 30 ) . These observations provided strong evidence that the dnaK and grpE proteins physically interact . We took advantage of these observations by cross - linking dnaK protein to an agarose matrix , as described under " Ma - terials and Methods , " and used this as a major purification step for the grpE protein . Table I details the exact purification procedure employed . Briefly , cells were lysed and pelleted . Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0 . 35 g / ml . The precipitated proteins were resuspended and dialyzed prior to loading onto the dnaK affinity column . Fig . 2 shows the overall protein and grpE activity profiles of fractions from TABLE I Purification of grpE protein from C600dnaK103 bacteria E . coli dmK103 bacteria were grown in L - broth supplemented with 0 . 2 % glucose at 37 " C to A595 , , m = 1 . 0 . The culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 7 , 000 rpm at 0 ' C in a Beckman JA - 10 rotor . The pellets ( 15 . 4 g total ) were rinsed with Buffer A , resuspended in a minimal volume of Buffer A , and frozen at - 70 " C . The cells were thawed dine ( Sigma ) , 50 mM dithiothreitol ( Sigma ) , 50 mM EDTA , and 0 . 2 slowly in a 4 " C waterbath . Ten ml of a solution of 46 pg / ml spermi - g / ml ammonium sulfate was added , followed by 2 . 2 ml of a fresh 20 mg / ml lysozyme ( from chicken egg white , Sigma ) solution . The volume of the mixture was brought to 74 ml by adding Buffer A . The resuspended cells were kept on ice for 45 min and then transferred to 37 " C for 5 min with gentle shaking . The lysate was cooled on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged for 30 min at 30 , 000 rpm at 0 ' C in a Beckman fixed - angle 35 rotor . To the supernatant ( fraction 1 , 73 ml ) , solid ammonium sulfate was slowly added to a final concentration of 0 . 35 g / ml . The solution was stirred for an additional 20 min . Subse - quently , it was centrifuged for 20 min at 30 , 000 rpm at 0 " C in a Beckman fixed - angle 35 rotor . After decanting the supernatant , the pellet was centrifuged for an additional 10 min at 20 , 000 rpm . The pellet was transferred to a dialysis bag ( Spectrapor , M . cutoff ; 12 , 000 - 14 , 000 ) and resuspended in approximately 2 ml of Buffer B . The suspension was dialyzed three times against 1 liter of Buffer B at 4 " C for 30 min each time . The dialyzed fraction ( approximately 5 ml ) was diluted with Buffer B ( no KCI ) to a conductivity equivalent to that of 50 mM KC1 in Buffer B ( fraction 2 , 19 ml ) . A 20 - ml dnaK affinity column ( 1 . 5 cm X 12 cm ) ( Bio - Rad Affi - Gel 10 ) was equili - brated with Buffer B prior to loading . Fraction 2 was applied to the column at a flow rate of 3 . 5 m1 / 30 min . The column was washed successively with 200 ml of 50 mM KC1 in Buffer B , 70 ml of 0 . 5 M KC1 in Buffer B , and 70 ml of 2 M KC1 in Buffer B . The column was re - equilibrated with 100 ml of 50 mM KC1 in Buffer B , followed hy elution of the grpE protein with 50 ml of 50 mM KCl , 20 mM MgC12 , and 10 mM ATP in Buffer B ( pH adjusted to 7 . 6 ) . The presence of the grpE protein was monitored by the Xdu DNA replication assay described under " Materials and Methods " and in the legend of Fig . C at 4 " C for 10 h each time and stored at - 70 " C . 1 .

The binding of grpE to the column appears to be highly resistant to salt as evidenced by its retention even in the presence of 2 M KC1 ( Fig . 2 ) . The fact that the dnaK protein exhibits a weak 5 ' - nucleotidase and autophosphorylating activities ( 23 , 31 ) suggested to us that the dnaK - grpE complex may be disrupted by ATP . This turned out to be the case . As seen in Fig . 2 , a 10 mM ATP solution eluted grpE quantitatively from the dnaK affinity column . The protein preparation was at least 95 % pure as judged by staining ( Fig . 3 ) . Its specific activity increased at least 650 - fold over that of the crude ammonium sulfate fraction in the in vitro replication assay ( Table I ) . The grpE Protein Is Required for Xdv Replication - Early genetic studies identified various host functions necessary for X propagation in vivo ( reviewed in Refs . 1 and 2 ) . These include the dnaB , d d , dnaK , and grpE gene products . Ad - ditional genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated a requirement for transcription by the E . coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme and for the dnaG ( primase ) , gyrA , gyrB , single - stranded binding , and DNA polymerase I11 holoenzyme pro - teins both in vivo and in vitro ( reviewed in Ref . 32 ) . Using the purified protein , we were able to demonstrate that grpE is required in the Xdv in vitro replication assay . The addition of the purified protein to a Fraction I1 prepared from grpE280 mutant bacteria allowed levels of X DNA replication comparable to those seen with a Fraction I1 from wild - type cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Biochemical and Physical Properties of the grpE Protein - We have previously shown that the synthesis of an acidic protein with M , of approximately 23 , 000 correlated with the ability of a AgrpE ' transducing phage ( 30 ) to complement the grpE280 mutation ( 7 ) . Co - electrophoresis of the purified pro - tein and a lysate of UV - irradiated cells infected with the AgrpE ' transducing phage demonstrated that the two proteins migrate to the same position on a two - dimensional gel ( data not shown ) . To support further the contention that the grpE protein had indeed been purified , the amino terminus of the purified protein was sequenced and compared to that predicted by A I \ I I1 \ \ I 5 IO 15 " 5 10 " 5 lo 15 20 Fraction numbel FIG . 2 .

The first 15 amino - terminal residues determined were Ser - Ser - Lys - Glu - Gln - Lys - Thr - Pro - Glu - Glu - Gln - Ala - Pro - Glu - Glu , in perfect agreement with the predicted sequence except that the initial methionine residue is not found in the purified protein . The molecular weight of the purified protein was estimated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions ( Fig . 5 ) . The molecular weight standards are those listed in the legend to Fig . 3 . Under these conditions , the molecular weight of the grpE monomer appears to be approx - imately 23 , 000 . The purified protein was also sedimented under nondena - turing conditions on a 20 - 40 % glycerol gradient . Its position in the gradient was determined both by assaying its activity in Xdu in vitro DNA replication and by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .

Incorporation of dNTPs into Xdu DNA was measured in the presence ( 0 ) of X DNA replication proteins , X 0 and XP .

Five pg of grpE protein was combined with proteins of various molecular weights ( listed in the legend of Fig . 3 ) and electrophoresed on a 12 . 5 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel . The mobilities of the molecular weight standards were calculated relative to the dye front . The slope and y intercept of the line were determined by linear regression . sedimented with the leading fractions of dnaK , ahead of ovalbumin ( Fig . 7 4 . Cosedimentation of dnaK and grpE is not seen in the presence of 10 mM ATP . Instead , they migrate separately as monomers ( Fig . 7b ) , with grpE at a position similar to that seen in Fig . 6 relative to ovalbumin . These are the results expected from the behavior of grpE on the dnaK affinity column . DISCUSSION Bacteriophage X has evolved various mechanisms of utiliz - ing E . coli functions to promote its own growth ( reviewed in Ref . 2 ) . One example of this is the replication of its DNA . Previous work has established that bacteriophage X relies heavily on host - coded proteins for replication of its DNA . These include the dnaJ , dnaK , and grpE proteins which ( a ) are essential for X DNA replication at all temperatures , ( b ) Escherichia coli grpE Protein 17441 Fraction number FIG . 6 .

Sedimentation proceeded for 28 h at 45 , 000 rpm at 0 " C in a Beckman SW 50 . 1 rotor . Two - drop fractions ( approximately 100 pl ) were collected from the bottom of the tube . One - pl aliquots for each fraction were used to assay for replication activity of the grpE protein . In a parallel exper - iment , grpE protein was loaded onto a gradient in the presence of proteins with known sedimentation coefficients as standards : 1 , trans - ferrin , smN = 5 . 1 ; 2 , bovine serum albumin , s20 , w = 4 . 3 ; 3 , ovalbumin , s20 . w = 3 . 6 ; and 4 , trypsinogen , smsu = 2 . 5 .

Interestingly , mutations in these three genes result in the same host phenotype at high temperature . That is , they block both RNA and DNA synthesis . Null or insertional mutants have been isolated in the dnuK and dnaJ genes ( 33 ) . 6 Such mutants are viable at 30 and 37 " C under laboratory conditions , but not at 43 " C . However , growth of the mutant strains at the permissive temperature is slower than wild - type , with the concomitant selection for extragenic suppres - sors ? We have purified the grpE protein of E . coli to at least 95 % homogeneity using a strain which overproduces heat shock proteins . This protein has the same isoelectric point as a protein encoded by a XgrpE + transducing phage ( 30 ) . The one - column purification scheme was devised based on earlier immunoprecipitation results suggesting a physical interaction between the grpE and dnaK proteins . Recently , extragenic suppressors of the grpE280 mutation have been mapped in the region of the dnuK gene : further supporting the existence of functional interactions between the two proteins in vivo . The grpE protein was purified from an ammonium sulfate fraction of a cell lysate by passing the fraction over an affinity column cross - linked to dnaK protein . The interaction be - tween the two proteins is stable in a high salt environment ( 2 M KCl ) . The grpE protein was eluted from the column in the presence of 10 mM ATP . This may be due to an ATP - induced conformational change in the dnaK protein which allows the release of the grpE protein . dnaK has both a weak 5 " nucle - S . Sell , P . Kang , E . A .

Gels were silver - stained ( 46 ) to visualize protein . otidase and autophosphorylating activities ( 23 , 31 ) . Alterna - tively , ATP may induce a conformational change in both dnaK and grpE or in grpE alone . The interaction between grpE and dnaK has been verified by glycerol gradient centrif - ugation . Alone , the grpE protein sediments as expected of a M , 23 , 000 monomer . Together with dnaK protein , however , grpE sediments with the leading fractions of dnaK , a position consistent with a 1 : l complex of the two proteins . Previous work from this and other laboratories has estab - lished interesting protein - protein interactions in X DNA rep - lication . These include an interaction between X 0 and XP ( 19 , 34 ) , XP and dnaB ( 17 , 35 - 38 ) , XP and dnaK ( 23 ) , dnaJ and dnaB : and grpE and dnaK ( this work ) proteins . All of these interactions appear to be important in in vivo X DNA repli - cation and together suggest the following model . The X 0 protein is known to bind specifically to oriX DNA sequences ( 39 ) and to form an " 0 - some ' ' structure with the DNA wrapped around it ( 40 ) . The XP protein binds to both dnaB and X 0 and , in so doing , localizes dnaB to the origin of XDNA . This results in the formation of an even larger protein - DNA aggregate at oriX ( 40 ) . At this stage , the dnaB protein , which is a helicase ( 41 ) , is thought to be tightly bound to XP . In K . Liberek , M . Zylicz , and C . Georgopoulos , unpublished results . 17442 Escherichia coli grpE Protein vitro studies have shown that interaction of dnaB with XP partially inhibits the dnaB protein’s NTPase activity ( 36 ) . Additional multiple protein - protein interactions and the known DNA - dnaJ interaction ( 22 ) could result in a “loosening up” of the tight XP - dnaB interaction and the subsequent positioning of dnaB onto a single - stranded region near oriX . This single - stranded region can be created in viuo as a con - sequence of the protein complex binding onto DNA and / or through transcription from PR . Once the dnaB protein has gained access onto single - stranded DNA , it could then unwind the double - stranded DNA through its helicase and NTPase activities ( 41 ) . In agreement with this model is the observation that , in the complete system of Dodson et aZ . ( 42 ) , DNA unwinds from oriX , specifically in the rightward direction . This system includes supercoiled Xdv plasmid , XO , XP , dnaB , dnaK , dnaJ , and single - stranded binding proteins . It is not clear why only unidirectional unwinding is observed in vitro . In uiuo , early X DNA replication is usually bidirectional ( 43 ) ; although occasionally unidirectionality , with rightward pref - erence , has also been observed in uivo ( 44 ) . It could be that a host factor , such as grpE , missing from this system is impor - tant in conferring bidirectionality to the system . Recently , McMacken et al . ( 32 ) have reported that the addition of gyrase and DNA polymerase I11 to the above purified system results in Xdu replication in uitro . Two inter - esting observations were made . First , RNA polymerase tran - scription is not necessary in this system . It turns out that the HU DNA - binding protein ( 45 ) is an inhibitor of this system . On the basis of their results , McMacken et al . ( 32 ) propose that RNA transcription in vivo and in vitro is necessary to antagonize the inhibitory role of HU protein . In the purified system , no HU protein is present ; hence , there is no need for RNA polymerase transcription . Second , grpE is not essential in this system , as is also the case in the M13 single - stranded system . What , then , is the role of grpE in X DNA replication ? A key observation made by Alfano and McMacken’O is that , in the presence of grpE , the requirement for high levels of dnaK protein in the in vitro system is drastically reduced . Several possibilities can be considered to explain this result . It could be ( a ) that the dnaK - grpE complex is more active than the dnaK protein alone in performing the required dnaK function at oriX , ( b ) that the only role of grpE protein is to allow for oligomerization of dnaK protein and that an oligo - merized dnaK protein is the active species in X DNA replica - tion , or ( c ) that grpE “modifies” or stabilizes the dnaK protein into an active form and that such a modified dnaK form is the active species in X DNA replication . Now that both purified grpE and dnaK proteins are available , these possibil - ities can be tested . REFERENCES 1 . Furth , M . E . , and Wickner , S . H . ( 1983 ) in Lambda II ( Hendrix , R .
