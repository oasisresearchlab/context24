Introduction Endosomes coordinate endocytic and biosynthetic membrane traffic to lysosomes ( Mellman , 1996 ) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , three types of endosome have been characterised : early / recycling endosome , prevacuolar compartment ( PVC ) , and multivesicular body ( MVB ) / late endosome . Early / recycling endosomes and PVCs are smaller and often cortical , whereas MVBs / late endosomes are larger , contain internal vesicles , and are often adjacent to the vacuole ( yeast lysosome equivalent ) ( Hicke et al . , 1997 ; Mulholland et al . , 1999 ; Prescianotto - Baschong and Riezman , 1998 ; Prescianotto - Baschong and Riezman , 2002 ) ( reviewed by Bryant and Stevens , 1998 ; Munn , 2000 ) . Some vacuolar membrane proteins and internalised surface proteins are sorted into internal vesicles during transport through endosomes in a process known as MVB sorting and are ultimately delivered to the vacuole lumen . Other membrane proteins are retained on the limiting membrane of endosomes and are delivered to the vacuole limiting membrane ( Piper and Luzio , 2001 ) . Soluble vacuolar proteins are also delivered to the vacuole via the secretory pathway . They are synthesised as larger precursors , translocated into the ER lumen , and after transport to the late Golgi are sorted by the sorting receptor Vps10p into a distinct PVC - directed class of transport vesicle . In the vacuole they are processed to the mature form . Vacuolar protein sorting ( vps ) mutants secrete soluble vacuolar proteins into the medium because of defects in this sorting process ( Bryant and Stevens , 1998 ) . One subset of VPS genes ( class E VPS ) is required for MVB sorting . Class E vps mutants accumulate newly synthesized soluble and membrane - associated vacuolar proteins and late Golgi proteins ( e . g . Vps10p ) in an enlarged endocytic compartment adjacent to the vacuole ( known as the ‘class E compartment’ ) ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ; Davis et al . , 1993 ; Piper 3957 Vps4p ( End13p ) is an AAA - family ATPase that functions in membrane transport through endosomes , sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins to the vacuole , and multivesicular body ( MVB ) sorting of membrane proteins to the vacuole lumen . In a yeast two - hybrid screen with Vps4p as bait we isolated VPS20 ( YMR077c ) and the novel open reading frame YLR181c , for which the name VTA1 has recently been assigned ( Saccharomyces Genome Database ) . Vps4p directly binds Vps20p and Vta1p in vitro and binding is not dependent on ATP – conversely , Vps4p binding to Vps20p is partially sensitive to ATP hydrolysis . Both ATP binding [ Vps4p - ( K179A ) ] and ATP hydrolysis [ Vps4p - ( E233Q ) ] mutant proteins exhibit enhanced binding to Vps20p and Vta1p in vitro . The Vps4p - Vps20p interaction involves the coiled - coil domain of each protein , whereas the Vps4p - Vta1p interaction involves the ( non - coiled - coil ) C - terminus of each protein . Deletion of either VPS20 ( vps20 D ) or VTA1 ( vta1 D ) leads to similar class E Vps – phenotypes resembling those of vps4 D , including carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) secretion , a block in ubiquitin - dependent MVB sorting , and a delay in both post - internalisation endocytic transport and biosynthetic transport to the vacuole . The vacuole resident membrane protein Sna3p ( whose MVB sorting is ubiquitin - independent ) does not appear to exit the class E compartment or reach the vacuole in cells lacking Vps20p , Vta1p or Vps4p , in contrast to other proteins whose delivery to the vacuole is only delayed . We propose that Vps20p and Vta1p regulate Vps4p function in vivo .

A key player in MVB sorting , and the only class E Vps protein with known enzymatic activity , is the VPS4 gene product ( Vps4p ) . Vps4p is a member of the AAA ( ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities ) - family of ATPases that also includes other membrane transport proteins such as NEM - sensitive fusion protein ( NSF / Sec18p ) ( Babst et al . , 1997 ; Finken - Eigen et al . , 1997 ) . Several other class E VPS genes encode small coiled - coil proteins that are cytosolic in wild - type cells but accumulate on endosomes in mutant cells lacking Vps4p ATPase activity ( Babst et al . , 1998 ; Babst et al . , 2002 ) . By analogy with NSF / Sec18p , which uses ATP hydrolysis to disassemble SNARE complexes on the surface of various membrane compartments , Vps4p may disassemble a coiled - coil class E Vps protein complex on the surface of endosomes ( Babst et al . , 1998 ) . We previously isolated a vps4 mutant ( end13 , renamed vps4 - E13 ) in a screen for mutants unable to survive loss of the 60 kDa subunit of vacuolar ATPase ( Vma2p / Vat2p ) and defective in ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . In vps4 - E13 receptor - mediated internalisation is only slightly affected , but subsequent transport of internalised cargo through early and late endosomes to the vacuole is strongly delayed ( Munn and Riezman , 1994 ; Zahn et al . , 2001 ) . We report here that the class E Vps protein Vps20p and the product of a novel open reading frame ( ORF ) VTA1 / YLR181c interact with Vps4p . We show that binding of each protein to Vps4p is direct and does not require ATP , and identify the domains of each protein that mediate interaction . Loss of Vps20p or Vta1p leads to class E vps phenotypes similar to those caused by loss of Vps4p . We also show that whereas transport of other membrane proteins through the class E compartment to the vacuole is only delayed , the vacuole resident protein Sna3p cannot exit the class E compartment in cells lacking Vps20p , Vta1p or Vps4p . Materials and Methods Media , reagents , strains and plasmids Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Escherichia coli strain BL21 CodonPlus TM ( DE3 ) was from Stratagene ( La Jolla , CA , USA ) .

Anti - pentaHIS monoclonal antibody ( mouse ) and NTA - Ni 2 + - agarose were from Qiagen ( Hilden , Germany ) . Genetic techniques Genetic crosses and tetrad analysis were performed as described in Adams et al . ( Adams et al . , 1997 ) . Transformation of yeast with plasmid DNA was either by a modiﬁcation of the lithium acetate protocol ( Munn et al . , 1995 ) or using the lithium acetate protocol recommended by Clontech for strain EGY48 . Genomic DNA was prepared from S . cerevisiae essentially as described by Adams et al . ( Adams et al . , 1997 ) and PCR ampliﬁcation was performed with Pfu polymerase ( Stratagene ) or Taq polymerase ( Stratagene ) . Plasmid DNA was isolated from S . cerevisiae using the method of Adams et al . ( Adams et al . , 1997 ) and introduced into E . coli by electroporation ( Dower et al . , 1988 ) . The BAR1 gene was disrupted using a bar1 : : LYS2 construct ( pEK3 ) as described previously ( Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ) . For functional studies , a congenic set of wild - type , vps20 D and vta1 D strains were analysed . Wild - type and vps20 cells were described previously in the parental strains SF838 - 9D ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . The vps20 mutant strain was originally isolated as the vpl10 - 7 mutant ( vps20 - 7 ) . The vps20 - 7 strain was complemented by a low copy plasmid carrying the wild - type VPS20 gene , but not the vps20 gene isolated from the vps20 - 7 strain ( data not shown ) .

This conﬁrms that YMR077c is the ORF corresponding to VPS20 , consistent with previous reports ( Kranz et al . , 2001 ; Howard et al . , 2001 ; Forsberg et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , for simplicity , we refer to the vps20 - 7 strain as vps20 D . Y04130 ( vta1 D : : KanMx ) and the isogenic wild - type strain Y10000 were obtained from Euroscarf ( European Saccharomyces Cerevisiae ARchives for Functional Analysis , Frankfurt , Germany ) . To introduce vta1 D into the SF838 - 9D strain background , a PCR fragment encoding the KanMx ORF ﬂanked by 400 bp either side of the YLR181c coding sequence was ampliﬁed from Y04130 genomic DNA and used to transform SF838 - 9D cells . G418 - resistant colonies were veriﬁed for loss of YLR181c by PCR analysis of genomic DNA , and one isolate was retained for phenotypic analysis ( PLY3046 ) . For a - factor assays we prepared vps20 D and vta1 D MAT a strains that lack Bar , a secreted protease responsible for degradation of a - factor ( bar1 ) . DNA fragments corresponding to 301 to 1 nucleotide upstream and 5 to 230 nucleotides downstream of the VPS20 coding sequence were ampliﬁed by PCR and subcloned into pFA6a - KanMx6 either side of the KanMx gene ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) to create pAM399 . pAM399 was digested with Kpn I and Pst I to release a fragment containing the KanMx cassette with VPS20 ﬂanking sequences and used to disrupt the VPS20 gene in the wild - type MAT a bar1 strain RH1800 . G418 - resistant transformants were selected on YPUAD / G418 medium and the presence of the disruption was conﬁrmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA ( data not shown ) . One vps20 D haploid ( AMY174 ) was retained for further analysis . Complementation analysis was performed with several vps mutant strains including the vps2 - 7 ( vpl2 - 7 ) , vps20 - 7 ( vpl10 - 7 ) , vps22 - 6 ( vpl14 - 6 ) , vps25 - 1 ( vpl12 - 1 ) and vps37 - 2 ( vpl16 - 2 ) mutants deﬁned in previous studies ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) ( Table 1 ) . These studies showed that only vps20 - 7 failed to complement vps20 D ( AMY174 ) . Introduction of a low copy VPS20 plasmid corrected the CPY secretion defect in AMY174 . To make congenic vta1 D and wild - type strains suitable for a - factor assays , Y04130 was crossed with Y10000 and the resulting diploid subjected to tetrad dissection . Two haploids from this cross were AMY149 ( MAT a lys2 vta1 D ) and AMY158 ( MAT a lys2 VTA1 ) . The BAR1 gene was deleted in AMY149 and AMY158 , yielding AMY162 and AMY165 , respectively , which were then used for a - factor assays . The CPY missorting defect in AMY162 was complemented by the introduction of a low copy VTA1 plasmid . Yeast two - hybrid analysis A bait construct expressing full - length Vps4p as a fusion to the DNA - binding domain of LexA , pLexA - Vps4 ( pAM333 ) , was constructed and introduced into yeast strain EGY48 containing the reporter plasmid p8op - LacZ ( Clontech ) . Transformation of this strain with the pB42AD transcription activation domain vector alone did not confer signiﬁcant expression of the two - hybrid reporter genes LEU2 or lacZ ( data not shown ) . An S . cerevisiae two - hybrid library containing genomic DNA inserts in vector pB42AD ( pJG4 - 5 ) ( Gyuris et al . , 1993 ) ( a gift from U . Surana , IMCB , Singapore ) was transformed into this strain and colonies exhibiting expression of the LEU2 interaction reporter gene were selected on synthetic galactose / raffinose ( SG ) Table 2 .

The equivalent of 5 · 10 4 - 1 · 10 5 colonies were screened ( as assessed by plating one sample of the transformed cells on SD complete medium selecting only for pLexA - Vps4 and the pB42AD library plasmids ) . Positive colonies were subsequently tested for blue colouration on SG complete medium containing X - gal . The library plasmid was isolated from positive colonies and retransformed into EGY48 containing p8op - LacZ and either pLexA - Vps4 or pLexA vector alone . Library plasmids that were reproducibly able to confer growth on SG complete - Leu and blue colouration on SG complete + X - gal upon retransformation into EGY48 / p8op - LacZ cells containing pLexA - Vps4 , but not when introduced into EGY48 / p8op - LacZ cells containing pLexA vector only , were retained for further analysis . b - galactosidase activity was assayed using a kit as recommended by the manufacturer . To identify the domains within Vps20p and Vta1p that mediate two - hybrid interaction with Vps4p , we constructed a series of plasmids expressing different fragments of Vps20p or Vta1p fused in - frame with B42AD ( in pB42AD ) ( Table 2 ) . To identify the domains within Vps4p that mediate two - hybrid interaction with Vps20p and Vta1p , we constructed a series of plasmids expressing different fragments of Vps4p fused in - frame with LexA ( in pLexA ) ( Table 2 ) . We then tested interaction of both the longer fragments of Vps20p and Vta1p encoded by the original library clones ( pAM349 and pAM398 , respectively ) and the shorter fragments encoded by the pB42AD - based plasmids described above with full - length Vps4p ( pAM333 ) in EGY48 carrying p8op - LacZ . We also tested interaction of full - length Vps4p ( pAM333 ) and the shorter fragments encoded by the pLexA - based plasmids described above with the original library clones of Vps20p and Vta1p ( pAM349 and pAM398 , respectively ) in EGY48 carrying p8op - LacZ . The strength of interaction was assessed by blue colouration on SG complete medium containing X - gal . Construction of VPS20and VTA1complementing plasmids The wild - type VPS20 and VTA1 full - length genes were ampliﬁed by PCR using Pfu polymerase from RH1800 yeast genomic DNA . An amount ( 400 bp ) of upstream sequence was included for VPS20 and 1kb for VTA1 . These fragments were cloned into the low - copy plasmids YCplac33 and YCplac111 , respectively ( Gietz and Sugino , 1988 ) . The inserts of YCp - VPS20 ( pAM214 ) and YCp - VTA1 ( pAM272 ) were conﬁrmed by sequencing . YCp - VPS20 and YCp - VTA1 were able to fully complement the Vps – defect of vps20 D and vta1 D , respectively . In vitro binding assays To test whether Vps20p and Vta1p can bind Vps4p in vitro we expressed Vps20p and Vta1p as fusions to glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) . The full - length VPS20 and VTA1 coding sequences were ampliﬁed by PCR from pAM214 and pAM272 and cloned into pGEX5X - 1 ( Amersham / Pharmacia Biotech ) in - frame and 3 ¢ of GST . vps4E233Q - 6HIS and vps4K179A - 6HIS were constructed by amplifying VPS4 by PCR from yeast genomic DNA using internal mutagenic primers and 5 ¢ and 3 ¢ VPS4 ﬂanking primers including Nde I and Bam HI sites , respectively . Wild - type VPS4 - 6HIS was constructed by amplifying VPS4 using the ﬂanking primers only . The 3 ¢ ﬂanking primers also encoded six histidine residues fused in - frame with the Vps4p C - terminus . Wild - type VPS4 - 6HIS , vps4E233Q - 6HIS and vps4K179A - 6HIS were cloned into pET11a between the Nde I and Bam HI sites and 3 ¢ of the T7 promoter . Inserts and frame were conﬁrmed by sequencing . The GST - and 6HIS - tagged proteins were expressed in BL21 - CodonPlus TM ( DE3 ) E . coli and puriﬁed using glutathione - agarose or Ni 2 + - NTA agarose beads , respectively . The VPS4 gene was ampliﬁed without the terminator codon from RH1800 genomic DNA and ligated into a YCplac111 - based plasmid encoding yEGFP ( a gift of B . Winsor , IBMC , University of Strasbourg , France ) to create a fusion in which the C - terminus of VPS4 is fused to yEGFP ( pAM352 ) . pAM352 fully complemented the Vps – phenotype of vps4 D and therefore encodes a functional fusion protein ( data not shown ) . The binding of Vps4p in yeast lysates to recombinant Vps20p and Vta1p was assayed as follows . vps4 D ( RH2906 ) cells expressing Vps4p - GFP ( pAM352 ) or Vps4p with no tag ( pEND13 . 1 ) ( Zahn et al . , 2001 ) were grown in SD minimal medium and subjected to glass bead lysis in extraction buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 200 mM sorbitol , 100 mM potassium acetate , 1 mM EDTA , pH7 . 5 ) containing protease inhibitors ( 10 m g / ml aprotinin , 5 m g / ml leupeptin , 8 m g / ml pepstatin , 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylﬂuoride ) and 1 mM DTT . Low - speed centrifugation ( 700 g ) was used to remove unbroken cells and the resulting supernatant ( S1 ) was fractionated by differential centrifugation into 16 , 000 g and 100 , 000 g pellets ( P2 , P3 ) and a 100 , 000 g supernatant ( S3 ) . The S3 fraction was supplemented with 20 mM MgCl 2 and divided in two . One sample was incubated with apyrase ( 5 . 7 U / ml ﬁnal ) for 10 minutes at room temperature to deplete endogenous ATP , whereas the other was incubated without apyrase . The apyrase activity under these buffer and temperature conditions was approximately 25 % of that speciﬁed by the manufacturer ( i . e . 1 . 4 U / ml ﬁnal ) ( data not shown ) . Both ATP - depleted and untreated lysates were then incubated with beads bearing GST - Vps20p , GST - Vta1p or GST only at 4°C for 12 hours . Unbound protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid , dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer , and neutralised with 1 M Tris base . The beads were washed with extraction buffer prior to elution of the bound proteins by heating in Laemmli sample buffer . Proteins in each sample were resolved by SDS - PAGE , transferred to Immobilon - P SQ PVDF membranes and Vps4p - GFP was detected with an anti - GFP antiserum and enhanced chemiluminescence . To test direct binding of Vps4p to Vps20p and Vta1p , 6HIS - tagged wild - type or mutant Vps4p were expressed in and puriﬁed from E . coli as described above . Vps4p - 6HIS was eluted from the beads with 250 mM imidazole in PBS containing 1mM b - mercaptoethanol and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 and dialysed against extraction buffer containing 1 mM DTT . For binding assays , 5 - 10 m g of puriﬁed wild - type or mutant Vps4 - 6HIS in extraction buffer containing 1 mM DTT and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylﬂuoride were used . Each sample was supplemented to 20 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and incubated with beads bearing GST - Vps20p ( 500 m g ) , GST - Vta1p ( 100 m g ) or GST ( 500 m g ) in the presence or absence of 1 mM ATP at 4°C for 12 hours . The samples were processed as above ( with the slight modiﬁcation that unbound samples were supplemented with bovine serum albumin as carrier prior to precipitation with trichloroacetic acid ) . After SDS - PAGE Vps4p - 6HIS was detected by immunoblotting using a pentaHIS - speciﬁc monoclonal antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence . Endocytosis assays Fluid - phase endocytosis was measured by vacuolar accumulation of the membrane - impermeant ﬂuorescent dye LY carbohydrazide following incubation for 1 hour at 24°C as described in Munn et al . ( Munn et al . , 1999 ) . Endocytosis of plasma membrane was assayed using the lipid - soluble styryl dye FM4 - 64 ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . Cells were incubated with 2 m M FM4 - 64 at 0°C for 30 minutes to label the cell surface . Then the cells were washed on ice , resuspended in fresh medium at 30°C ( 0’ ) , and transport of the dye from the cell surface to the vacuole was assessed at various time points . [ 35 S ] a - factor internalisation assays were performed at 30°C using the continuous presence protocol ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . [ 35 S ] a - factor degradation assays were performed at 30°C using the pulse - chase protocol ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . Carboxypeptidase Y missorting test To assess maturation of newly synthesised CPY and processing of the receptor for soluble vacuolar proteins ( Vps10p ) we Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 19 ) 3961 Vps20p and Vta1p function with Vps4p immunoprecipitated CPY and Vps10p from cells labeled with [ 35 S ] Methionine / cysteine as described ( Piper et al . , 1995 ) . For this analysis , strains were converted to Pep + by transformation with pTS18 ( PEP4 centromeric plasmid ) . Multivesicular body sorting assay Localisation of Ste3 - GFP , Fth1 - GFP - Ub , Sna3 - GFP and NBD - PC were performed as previously described ( Bilodeau et al . , 2002 ) . The Sna3 - GFP reporter used here was made by amplifying SNA3 without a termination codon by PCR using RH1800 genomic DNA and then subcloning it into a YCplac111 - based plasmid 5 ¢ and in - frame with yEGFP ( pAM397 ) . This places the GFP at the Sna3p C - terminus . Fluorescence microscopy All microscopy was performed using an Olympus BX - 60 microscope ﬁtted with Differential Interference Contrast ( DIC ) light ﬁlters and appropriate ﬂuorescence light ﬁlters . Results Vps20p and Vta1p interact with Vps4p A bait plasmid encoding full - length Vps4p fused to the LexA DNA binding domain ( LexA ) , pLexA - Vps4 ( pAM333 ) , was used to screen a library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA fragments fused to the B42 transcription activation domain ( B42AD ) to identify novel Vps4p two - hybrid interactors . Of 20 library plasmids that activated the reporters upon isolation and retransformation into the EGY48 tester strain containing pLexA - Vps4 , four contained identical inserts from ORF YMR077c / VPS20 / CHM6 ( encoding residues 3 - 221 of 221 ) and six contained identical inserts from the novel ORF YLR181c ( for which the name VTA1 has recently been assigned by L . Eguez and S . Garrett , Saccharomyces Genome Database ) ( encoding residues 108 - 330 of 330 ) fused in - frame with B42AD ( Fig . 1A ) . One VPS20 clone ( pAM349 ) and one VTA1 clone ( pAM398 ) were retained for further analysis . Both pAM349 and pAM398 conferred strong activation of the reporters in the presence of pLexA - Vps4 after 2 days of incubation that did not increase further after 4 days ( Fig . 1B ) . However , the pLexA - Vps4 bait and pB42AD - based library plasmids did not activate the reporters either alone or in combination with the empty pB42AD or pLexA vectors , respectively , even after 4 days of incubation ( Fig . 1B ) . Quantiﬁcation of reporter expression by b - galactosidase activity assays conﬁrmed the results of the plate assays ( Fig . 1C ) . We next used the yeast two - hybrid system to map the domains of Vps4p , Vps20p and Vta1p that mediate the interactions . Two - hybrid plasmids expressing various fragments of Vps4p , Vps20p and Vta1p were constructed ( Fig . 1A , Table 2 ) . The results of two - hybrid analyses using these constructs as well as pLexA - Vps4 ( pAM333 ) and the original Vps20p and Vta1p library clones ( pAM349 and pAM398 , respectively ) are shown in Tables 3 and 4 . The N - terminal coiled - coil domain of Vps4p interacted very strongly with Vps20p , but not with Vta1p , whereas the C - terminal acidic domain of Vps4p interacted with both proteins , but more strongly with Vta1p . The AAA - ATPase domain did not interact with either Vps20p or Vta1p . A fragment containing the central coiled - coil domain plus the C - terminal domain of Vps20p was necessary and sufficient for interaction with full - length Vps4p . In the case of Vta1p , the C - terminal domain was sufficient for interaction with Vps4p . Vps20p and Vta1p directly bind Vps4p in vitro We next tested whether Vps20p or Vta1p bind Vps4p in vitro . Vps20p and Vta1p were expressed as GST fusions in bacteria and puriﬁed . Beads bearing GST - Vps20p or GST - Vta1p , but not beads bearing GST alone , precipitated GFP - tagged Vps4p from yeast lysates ( Fig . 2 ) . We also tested the ability of Vps4p - GFP to associate with GST - Vps20p and GST - Vta1p after depletion of ATP from the lysates . The association of Vps4p - GFP with GST - Vps20p , but not GST - Vta1p , was slightly enhanced ( approximately twofold ) by ATP depletion ( Fig . 2 ) . Strong association of Vps4p - GFP with both GST - Vps20p and GST - Vta1p was also observed after depletion of free Mg 2 + ( data not shown ) . Hence , the in vitro association of Vps4p with Vps20p and Vta1p does not require ATP , and in the case of Vps20p it is slightly sensitive to ATP hydrolysis . Similar results were obtained using a Vps4p construct with a C - terminal myc - epitope ( data not shown ) . In order to test whether Vps4p directly binds Vps20p and Vta1p in vitro and to further examine the role of ATP binding , we expressed wild - type Vps4p - 6HIS , Vps4pE233Q - 6HIS ( ATP hydrolysis defective ) and Vps4pK179A - 6HIS ( ATP binding defective ) in bacteria . Each protein was affinity puriﬁed and used in pulldown assays using beads bearing GST - Vps20p , GST - Vta1p or GST only ( Fig . 3 ) . Wild - type Vps4p - 6HIS bound both GST - Vps20p and GST - Vta1p , but not GST alone , in vitro , indicating that the association of Vps4p with Vps20p and Vta1p is direct and not mediated by other proteins . Binding was observed in the presence and in the absence of added ATP , in agreement with the results described above for Vps4p - GFP in yeast lysates . Binding of Vps4p - 6HIS to GST - Vta1p was not affected by addition of ATP , but binding to GST - Vps20p was stronger when ATP was omitted . These ﬁndings are in agreement with the results described above that association of Vps4p - GFP in yeast lysates with GST - Vps20p is stronger after depleting the lysate of ATP . Vps4pE233Q - 6HIS and Vps4pK179A - 6HIS also bound to both GST - Vps20p and GST - Vta1p , but not to GST alone , indicating in another way that ATP binding is not necessary for association of Vps4p with Vps20p or Vta1p . In the case of both mutant Vps4p - 6HIS proteins , binding to GST - Vps20p and GST - Vta1p was signiﬁcantly enhanced compared with wild - type Vps4p - 6HIS . As expected , binding of the mutant Vps4p - 6HIS proteins to GST - Vps20p and GST - Vta1p was not signiﬁcantly affected by addition of ATP . Vps20p and Vta1p are required for efficient post - internalisation transport of a - factor We next determined whether Vps20p or Vta1p are required for receptor - mediated endocytosis . Receptor - mediated uptake of [ 35 S ] a - factor was assayed at 30°C in vps20 D and vta1 D and the corresponding wild - type strains ( Fig . 4 ) . [ 35 S ] a - factor was internalised by all four strains , although vps20 D and vta1 D showed slightly slower kinetics and this difference was reproducible . To investigate whether post - internalisation 3962 transport of [ 35 S ] a - factor to the vacuole is affected in the mutants , we assayed the kinetics of [ 35 S ] a - factor degradation at 30°C . Both the vps20 D and vta1 D mutations signiﬁcantly delayed the vacuolar delivery and consequent degradation of the internalised [ 35 S ] a - factor ( as assessed by loss of intact [ 35 S ] a - factor spots and appearance of degraded [ 35 S ] a - factor spots ) ( Fig . 5 ) . Loss of Vps20p or Vta1p result in CPY secretion and accumulation of Ste3 - GFP in an endosomal compartment To characterize the role of Vps20p and Vta1p in vacuolar protein sorting and MVB sorting , we constructed congenic vps20 D and vta1 D mutant strains using the SF838 - 9D MAT a parental strain . SF838 - 9D has been extensively used for Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 19 ) Fig . 1 . Vps4p interacts with Vps20p and Vta1p .

( B ) Yeast two - hybrid interactions of Vps4p with Vps20p and Vta1p . Yeast strain EGY48 carrying the reporter plasmid p8op - LacZ together with either pLexA vector alone or pLexA - VPS4 ( pAM333 ) , and either pB42AD vector alone , pB42AD - VPS20 or pB42AD - VTA1 were plated on SD complete medium lacking uracil , histidine and tryptophan to select for the p8op - LacZ , pLexA - based and pB42AD - based plasmids , respectively . After the strains had grown sufficiently they were replica plated to synthetic galactose / raffinose ( SG ) complete medium containing X - gal to test expression of the lacZ two - hybrid interaction reporter gene . The plates were photographed after 4 days at 30°C . Shown are patches representing four independent transformants for each plasmid combination ( a - f ) . ( C ) Quantiﬁcation of yeast two - hybrid interactions . Each of the strains in B was assayed for b - galactosidase activity as a measure of the strength of two - hybrid interaction . Activities ( in Miller units ) represent the means obtained from assaying three independent transformants . Error bars , + / – s . e . m . 3963 Vps20p and Vta1p function with Vps4p analysis of these processes ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) and carries the pep4 - 3 mutation that allows lumenal vesicles to accumulate in the vacuole . Ste3p is the plasma membrane receptor for the secreted yeast mating pheromone a - factor . In wild - type cells , Ste3 - GFP travels to the cell surface and is then rapidly endocytosed and delivered to the vacuole . The Ste3 - GFP protein typically accumulates to high levels in the lumen of wild - type vacuoles indicative of proper MVB sorting to intralumenal vesicles ( Urbanowski and Piper , 2001 ) . To test whether Vps20p and Vta1p are required for MVB sorting of Ste3p , we localised Ste3 - GFP in wild - type cells and in vps20 D and vta1 D cells carrying the low copy YCp - VPS20 plasmid or YCp - VTA1 plasmid or empty vector only ( Fig . 6 ) . In both vps20 D and vta1 D cells Ste3 - GFP was found on the limiting membrane of the vacuole as well as in 2 - 3 punctate structures adjacent to the vacuole , but not in the vacuole lumen . The punctate structures adjacent to the vacuole were similar to the class E compartments observed for other class E vps mutants ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . The defects in MVB sorting of Ste3 - GFP were corrected when the vps20 D strain or vta1 D strain was transformed with the corresponding wild - type gene borne on a low - copy plasmid ( Fig . 6 ) . To test whether Vta1p , like Vps20p , is required for efficient vacuolar protein sorting , we compared the sorting of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) to the vacuole in cells lacking Vps20p or Vta1p . Both the vps20 D and vta1 D mutants secreted ~ 40 % of CPY after a 60 - minute chase ( Fig . 7 ) . Previous studies have shown that CPY secretion is because of depletion of the CPY receptor ( Vps10p ) from the Golgi and its accumulation within the class E endosomal compartment . In Pep + cells the class E compartment is proteolytically active and the delivery and accumulation of Vps10p in the class E compartment can be monitored by pulse / chase labeling and immunoprecipitation of Vps10p ( Piper et al . , 1995 ) . In vps20 D and vta1 D , a signiﬁcant amount of newly synthesised Vps10p undergoes a PEP4 - dependent cleavage after a 60 - minute chase consistent with what has been observed for other class E vps mutants ( Cereghino et al . , 1995 ) . Vps20p and Vta1p are required for MVB formation The defects in MVB sorting of Ste3 - GFP in vps20 D and vta1 D mutants was consistent with a role of Vps20p and Vta1p in MVB formation . This process incorporates a variety of membrane proteins into intralumenal vesicles that accumulate in the vacuoles of pep4 mutant yeast ( Piper and Luzio , 2001 ) . For some proteins , their delivery to the vacuole interior is dependent on attachment of ubiquitin , whereas the delivery of other proteins is ubiquitin - independent ( Katzmann et al . , 2002 ) . The ubiquitin - dependent MVB sorting mechanism is exempliﬁed by the chimeric Fth1 - GFP - Ub reporter protein . Fth1p is an iron transporter whose distribution is restricted to the limiting membrane of the vacuole , but the Fth1 - GFP - Ub chimera is a substrate for ubiquitin - dependent MVB sorting and in wild - type cells localises to vacuolar intralumenal vesicles ( Urbanowski and Piper , 2001 ) . The ubiquitin - independent sorting mechanism is exempliﬁed by the Sna3 - GFP reporter protein . Sna3p is an integral membrane protein ﬁrst identiﬁed as a component of vacuolar intralumenal Table 3 .

MVB sorting of Sna3p is not affected by substitution of its two cytoplasmic lysines ( potential ubiquitination sites ) or by lowered free ubiquitin levels ( e . g . in a doa4 D mutant ) and is thus ubiquitin - independent ( Reggiori and Pelham , 2001 ) . In wild - type cells , we found that both Fth1 - GFP - Ub and Sna3 - GFP were localised to the vacuole lumen ( Fig . 8 ) . However , in either vps20 D or vta1 D cells , Fth1 - GFP - Ub accumulated on both the limiting membrane of the vacuole as well as in large ‘class E’ structures similar to where Ste3 - GFP accumulated ( Figs 6 , 8 ) . Sna3 - GFP was also excluded from the vacuole interior , but far less was observed on the limiting membrane of the vacuole . Rather , Sna3 - GFP was found almost exclusively within class E compartments . Morphometric analysis of ﬂuorescence intensity between Ste3 - GFP , Fth1 - GFP - Ub and Sna3 - GFP conﬁrmed that the exclusive localisation of Sna3 - GFP to the class E compartment was not because of the overall level of these proteins or limits in ﬂuorescence detection . Aside from the inability to sort membrane proteins into intralumenal vesicles , at least some class E vps mutants ( including vps4 ) are also unable to perform lipid sorting events required to make lumenal vesicles . Previously , NBD - PC has been shown to be a lipid marker of the intralumenal vesicles ( Bilodeau et al . , 2002 ; Hanson et al . , 2002 ) . To test whether Vps20p and Vta1p are ( like Vps4p ) required for sorting of lipids into intralumenal vesicles , we compared the distribution of internalised NBD - PC in wild - type , vps20 D and vta1 D mutants ( Fig . 9 ) . In wild - type cells , NBD - PC was sorted into vesicles in the vacuole lumen . In vps20 D or vta1 D cells , however , NBD - PC was not sorted into intralumenal vesicles , but remained on the limiting membrane of the vacuole as well as in class E endosomal compartments . Thus sorting of lipids ( as well as proteins ) to form intralumenal vesicles requires both Vps20p and Vta1p . Vps20p and Vta1p are required for efficient endocytosis of ﬂuid - phase and membrane markers from the cell surface to the vacuole We next tested whether Vps20p and Vta1p play a role in endocytic membrane traffic of bulk ﬂuid to the vacuole . Wild - type , vps20 D and vta1 D cells were incubated in the presence of the ﬂuid - phase endocytic marker LY and accumulation of the dye in the vacuole was examined ( Fig . 8 ) . Low levels of LY did accumulate in the vacuoles of vps20 D and vta1 D cells , but markedly less than in the vacuoles of wild - type cells . Therefore , both Vps20p and Vta1p are important for ﬂuid - phase transport to the vacuole , although not essential . We next examined whether Vps20p and Vta1p are important for bulk membrane transport from the cell surface to the vacuole . The lipid dye FM4 - 64 is a membrane - soluble dye that binds to the plasma membrane and is internalised by endocytosis and delivered to the vacuole membrane ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . Cell surface membranes of wild - type , vps20 D and vta1 D cells were labeled with FM4 - 64 at 0°C , and cells were then warmed to 30°C and assessed for distribution of FM4 - 64 at various times ( Fig . 10 ) . At early times after shift to 30°C , FM4 - 64 labeled small punctate structures and at later times it accumulated in 1 - 2 large late - endosomal / prevacuolar structures adjacent to the vacuole . By 30 minutes , FM4 - 64 could clearly be seen on the vacuole limiting membrane in wild - type cells . In contrast , the bulk of FM4 - 64 remained in large endosomal structures in both the vps20 D and vta1 D cells , indicating a delay in transport from the class E compartment to the vacuole . Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 19 ) Fig . 2 . Vps4p in yeast lysates associates with Vps20p and Vta1p and association is ATP - independent . Vps20p and Vta1p were expressed as GST fusions in E . coli and puriﬁed on glutathione - agarose beads . Vps4p , either tagged with GFP or without tag , was expressed from a centromeric plasmid in vps4 D ( RH2906 ) . Lysates were prepared from both strains and a 100 , 000 g supernatant ( S3 ) was supplemented with 20 mM MgCl 2 and incubated with beads bearing GST only or GST - Vps20p ( A ) , or with beads bearing GST only or GST - Vta1p ( B ) with or without pretreatment of the lysates with apyrase to deplete endogenous ATP . Unbound proteins ( unbound ) were recovered in the supernatants . After washing the beads , the speciﬁcally bound proteins ( bound ) were eluted by heating in Laemmli sample buffer . Proteins in both bound and unbound samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE , and transferred to PVDF membranes . Vps4p - GFP was detected by immunoblotting with a GFP - speciﬁc polyclonal antiserum . In each set of experiments the exposure times for the gels containing bound and unbound samples were identical . 3965 Vps20p and Vta1p function with Vps4p Discussion Here , we report that VPS20 and VTA1 encode Vps4p - interacting proteins . Several lines of evidence support this conclusion . First , in a yeast two - hybrid screen with Vps4p as bait , we isolated multiple clones of VPS20 and VTA1 . Second , GST fusion constructs containing Vps20p or Vta1p associate with endogenous Vps4p in yeast lysates as well as bacterially expressed and puriﬁed Vps4p . Finally , deletion of VPS20 or VTA1 causes class E Vps – phenotypes similar to deletion of VPS4 itself , suggesting that Vps20p and Vta1p function with Vps4p in vivo . Vps20p and two other class E Vps proteins , Snf7p / Vps32p / Did1p ( 30 % identity ) and Mos10p / Vps60p / Chm5p ( 15 % identity ) comprise a gene family ( Babst et al . , 1998 ; Amerik et al . , 2000 ; Kranz et al . , 2001 ; Howard et al . , 2001 ) . Hspc177 ( Genbank Acc . No . BC016698 ) encodes a mammalian protein with strong homology ( 21 % identity ) to yeast Vps20p over its full length . Other yeast family members include the class E Vps proteins Vps24p / Did3p , Did2p / Chm1p / Fti1p and Vps2p / Did4p / Ren1p / Chm2p ( Davis et al . , 1993 ; Babst et al . , 1998 ; Amerik et al . , 2000 ; Kranz et al . , 2001 ; Howard et al . , 2001 ) . Proteins in this family all have extensive coiled - coil domains that can potentially mediate protein - protein interaction ( Babst et al . , 1998 ; Kranz et al . , 2001 ; Howard et al . , 2001 ) ; for example , in Vps20p the coiled - coil domain comprises residues 61 - 169 as predicted using the COILS algorithm ( Lupas et al . , 1991 ) . Although this is the ﬁrst report of interaction between Vps4p and Vps20p , there have been two earlier reports of interactions between Vps4p and other family members : ( 1 ) a genomic two - hybrid screen identiﬁed an interaction between Vps4p and Snf7p / Vps32p ( Uetz et al . , 2000 ) , and ( 2 ) a yeast two - hybrid screen using CHMP1 ( the mammalian homologue of yeast Did2p / Chm1p ) as bait led to the identiﬁcation of human Vps4 - A / SKD1 as a CHMP1 interactor ( Howard et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , Did2p / Chm1p is among the other Vps4p two - hybrid interactors we identiﬁed in our screen ( M . Wagle and A . Munn , unpublished ) . Four of the six known coiled - coil class E Vps proteins ( viz . Vps20p , Snf7p , Vps2p and Vps24p ) have recently been shown to form a large protein complex known as ESCRTIII implicated in concentration and sorting of cargo proteins at the MVB prior to incorporation into intralumenal vesicles ( Babst et al . , 2002 ) . In vps4 D mutants , all four ESCRTIII proteins redistribute from the cytoplasm to the surface of endosomal membranes ( Babst et al . , 1998 ; Babst et al . , 2002 ) . Based on this in vivo data , it has been suggested that Vps4p uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to break coiled - coil interactions and release ESCRTIII proteins from the surface of endosomes into the cytoplasm . ATP - dependent release of ESCRTIII proteins from endosomal membranes by Vps4p has yet to be demonstrated in vitro , however a mutant form of human Vps4 - A ( E228Q ) that is locked in the ATP - bound state exhibits enhanced association with CHMP1 ( Howard et al . , 2001 ) . This data supports the conclusion that in the ATP - bound form Vps4p associates with class E Vps proteins and breaks coiled - coil interactions . We have shown here that binding of Vps4p to Vps20p in vitro is independent of ATP . A Vps4p ATP hydrolysis mutant ( E233Q ) exhibited increased binding to Vps20p in vitro compared with wild - type Vps4p , however an ATP binding mutant ( K179A ) also exhibited increased association ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , enhanced binding to coiled - coil proteins may be a feature of non - functional ( rather than ATP - bound ) Vps4p . This is consistent with the observation that an ATP - binding mutant of mammalian Vps4 - A ( KQ ) behaves like an ATP hydrolysis mutant ( EQ ) in exhibiting enhanced localisation to endosomes ( Bishop and Woodman , 2000 ) . ATP - independent association Fig . 3 . Vps4p directly binds Vps20p and Vta1p in vitro and binding is ATP - independent . Wild - type Vps4p , and both ATP hydrolysis mutant ( E233Q ) and ATP binding mutant ( K179A ) forms of Vps4p were tagged at the C - terminus with 6HIS and expressed in E . coli . Each protein was affinity puriﬁed using the 6HIS tag and incubated with beads bearing GST - Vps20p , GST - Vta1p or GST only in the presence or absence of added ATP . Unbound proteins ( unbound ) were recovered in the supernatants . After washing the beads , the speciﬁcally bound proteins ( bound ) were eluted by heating in Laemmli sample buffer . Proteins in both bound and unbound samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE , and transferred to PVDF membranes . Wild - type and mutant forms of Vps4p - 6HIS were detected by immunoblotting with a pentaHIS - speciﬁc monoclonal antiserum . In each set of experiments the exposure times for the gels containing bound and unbound samples were identical . 3966 with coiled - coil domain proteins may distinguish Vps4p from other AAA - ATPases , such as NEM - sensitive fusion protein ( NSF / Sec18p ) . NSF / Sec18p forms a 20S complex with soluble NSF attachment protein ( a - SNAP ) and a - SNAP - receptors ( SNARES ) and uses ATP hydrolysis to break coiled - coil interactions between SNARES . An NSF / Sec18p mutant protein with a mutation in the ﬁrst of its two AAA - domains ( D1 ) that prevents ATP binding is unable to associate with the a - SNAP - SNARE complex in vitro ( Nagiec et al . , 1995 ) . Nevertheless , our analysis strongly supports the view that ATP hydrolysis by Vps4p dissociates coiled - coil interactions as proposed by Babst et al . ( Babst et al . , 1998 ; Babst et al . , 2002 ) . Interaction of Vps4p with Vps20p appears to involve coiled - coil interactions ( Tables 3 , 4 ) and is sensitive to ATP hydrolysis ( Fig . 3 ) . ESCRTIII comprises Vps20p - Snf7p and Vps2p - Vps24p subcomplexes ( Babst et al . , 2002 ) . The Vps2p - Vps24p subcomplex has been proposed to mediate recruitment of Vps4p to endosomes based on the ﬁnding that accumulation of ATP - locked Vps4p - E233Q mutant protein on endosomes is affected in vps2 and vps24 mutants ( vps20 and snf7 mutants were not tested ) ( Babst et al . , 2002 ) . Our data suggest that Vps20p may also be important for recruitment of Vps4p to membranes . Vps20p is myristoylated and associates strongly with membranes ( Ashraﬁ et al . , 1998 ; Babst et al . , 2002 ) . Interestingly , myristoylation is not required for Vps20p interaction with Vps4p as Vps20p fusions lacking the myristoylation motif ( MG , residues 1 - 2 ) still exhibit strong two - hybrid interaction with Vps4p . Furthermore , bacterially expressed Vps20p binds Vps4p in vitro and bacteria lack the ability to perform myristoylation . Our data show that Vps20p interacts with the N - terminal coiled - coil domain of Vps4p essential for Vps4p association with endosomal membranes ( Babst et al . , 1998 ) . That Vps4p - E233Q and Vps4p - K179A mutant proteins exhibit increased association with Vps20p Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 19 ) Fig . 5 . Loss of Vps20p or Vta1p causes defects in a - factor degradation . Wild - type ( RH1800 ) and vps20 D ( AMY174 ) ( A ) , and wild - type ( AMY165 ) and vta1 D ( AMY162 ) ( B ) cells were grown to early exponential phase and assayed for [ 35 S ] a - factor transport to the vacuole and degradation at 30°C . [ 35 S ] a - factor was prebound to the cells on ice and then the cells were harvested at 4°C and resuspended in fresh YPUAD and incubated at 30°C . At the time points shown , samples were taken in duplicate and washed in either phosphate buffer pH6 ( removes unbound [ 35 S ] a - factor ) or citrate buffer pH 1 ( removes bound non - internalised [ 35 S ] a - factor ) . Lysates were prepared from each sample of cells and subjected to thin layer chromatography to separate intact ( i ) and degraded ( d ) [ 35 S ] a - factor , which were visualised by ﬂuorography at – 80°C . 6 , washed in pH 6 buffer ; 1 , washed in pH 1 buffer ; o , origin where samples were loaded . Fig . 4 . Loss of Vps20p or Vta1p causes only slightly altered kinetics of a - factor internalisation . Wild - type ( RH1800 ) and vps20 D ( AMY174 ) , and wild - type ( AMY165 ) and vta1 D ( AMY162 ) cells were grown to early exponential phase and assayed for [ 35 S ] a - factor internalisation at 30°C . After addition of the [ 35 S ] a - factor , samples were taken in duplicate at various time points and washed in either phosphate buffer pH 6 ( removes unbound [ 35 S ] a - factor ) or citrate buffer pH 1 ( removes bound but non - internalised [ 35 S ] a - factor ) . Shown is the internalised a - factor as a percentage of the bound a - factor at each time point . 3967 Vps20p and Vta1p function with Vps4p correlates well with reports that both mutant proteins also exhibit increased accumulation on endosomes in vivo ( Babst et al . , 1998 ; Bishop and Woodman , 2000 ) . The strength of Vps4p - Vps20p interaction may be an important determinant of Vps4p subcellular localization . YLR181c ( VTA1 ) is a novel class E VPS gene . Although Vta1p does not share signiﬁcant homology to other class E Vps proteins , a putative mammalian homologue is encoded by dopamine - responsive gene ( Drg - 1 ) ( GenBank Acc . No . AF271994 ) [ also known as LYST - interacting protein 5 ( Lip5 ) ( GenBank Acc . No . AF141341 ) ] . Drg - 1 / Lip5 has strong homology to Vta1p over N - ( 24 % identity ) and C - terminal ( 59 % identity ) sequences representing 43 % of the total length of the protein . LYST is the protein affected in the human inherited immune and neurological disorder Chediak - Higashi Syndrome ( CHS ) and in beige mutant mice . Defects in endosomal membrane transport and lysosome morphology have been reported in CHS ( Tchernev et al . , 2002 ) . The best yeast homologue of LYST is Bps1p , however deletion of BPS1 in the SF838 - 9D background gave no class E vps phenotypes ( R . C . Piper , unpublished ) . Vta1p has two predicted coiled - coil domains ( 1stCC and 2ndCC comprising residues 35 - 63 and 232 - 263 , respectively ) . The latter is encoded by all of our positive two - hybrid library clones , but our interaction domain analysis shows that Vps4p does not interact with the 1stCC or the 2ndCC domain of Vta1p . Instead , Vps4p interacts speciﬁcally with a short ( 65 residue ) domain located at the extreme Vta1p C - terminus that lacks predicted coiled - coil structure . Furthermore , Vps4p binds to Vta1p via its acidic C - terminal domain ( Tables 3 , 4 ) . Hence , coiled - coil interaction does not appear to mediate Vps4p interaction with Vta1p . This suggests that Vps4p may interact quite differently with Vta1p compared with coiled - coil Vps20p - family proteins . Vta1p may represent a stable subunit rather than a substrate of the Vps4p complex . Consistent with this , Vps4p binding to Vps20p in vitro is sensitive to ATP hydrolysis , whereas binding to Vta1p is unaffected by the presence or absence of ATP ( Figs 2 , 3 ) . Little is known about the role of the C - terminal acidic domain in Vps4p function . In the case of another AAA - family ATPase , Hsp104p , the acidic C - terminal domain regulates ATP hydrolysis by the AAA Fig . 6 . Loss of Vps20p or Vta1p causes defects in Ste3p localisation to the vacuole . Wild - type ( SF838 - 9D ) , vps20 ( SF838 - 9D vpl10 ) and vta1 ( PLY3046 ) cells were transformed with a low - copy plasmid encoding Ste3 - GFP in combination with an empty URA3 containing centromeric plasmid or centromeric plasmid containing the wild - type VTA1 or VPS20 gene as indicated . The localisation of Ste3 - GFP was then assessed by ﬂuorescence microscopy together with DIC imaging to identify yeast vacuoles . Cells were resuspended in 1 % sodium azide , 1 % sodium ﬂuoride , 100 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 prior to ﬂuorescence and DIC microscopy . Bar , 5 m m . Fig . 7 . Loss of Vps20p or Vta1p causes secretion of Golgi - modiﬁed p2 CPY precursor and degradation of Vps10p . Wild - type ( SF838 - 9D ) , vps20 D ( SF838 - 9D vpl10 ) and vta1 D ( PLY3046 ) cells were converted to PEP4 as described in Materials and Methods . They were pulse - labelled with [ 35 S ] methionine / cysteine for 10 minutes at 30°C and then chased with excess unlabelled methionine / cysteine at the same temperature . Samples were taken at 0 or 60 minutes of chase , and further membrane transport was stopped by addition of sodium azide and sodium ﬂuoride to 20 mM . The cells in each sample were converted to spheroplasts and fractionated into intracellular ( I ) and extracellular ( E ) fractions . CPY was immunoprecipitated from half the intracellular ( I ) and extracellular ( E ) fractions of the 60 - minute chase samples ( A ) . Vps10p was immunoprecipitated from the intracellular ( I ) fractions of the 0 - and 60 - minute chase samples ( B ) . Indicated are the mature ( mCPY ) and Golgi - modiﬁed ( p2CPY ) forms of CPY , and both full - length Vps10p ( Vps10p ) and the lower protease - cleaved band of Vps10p ( * ) . 3968 domain ( Cashikar et al . , 2002 ) . Although this is not known for Vps4p , it is intriguing to speculate that Vta1p regulates the ATPase activity of Vps4p . Loss of Vps20p or Vta1p confers classical class E Vps – phenotypes similar to loss of Vps4p , including : 1 ) a block in MVB sorting of endocytosed surface proteins , vacuolar membrane proteins and the lipid NBD - PC ; 2 ) accumulation of endocytosed surface proteins ( e . g . Ste3p ) , lipid - soluble endocytic dyes ( e . g . FM4 - 64 ) and vacuolar membrane proteins ( e . g . CPS , Sna3p ) in the ‘class E’ compartment ; and 3 ) secretion of Golgi - modiﬁed p2CPY . As in other class E vps mutants , p2CPY secretion is associated with degradation of Vps10p . In wild - type cells Vps10p is stable and cycles from the late Golgi to the PVC during the sorting of soluble vacuolar hydrolases to the PVC . In class E vps mutants Vps10p and vacuolar hydrolases are trapped in the class E compartment and Vps10p is degraded . Some phenotypic characterisation has already been reported for vps20 , but this is the ﬁrst report that vta1 mutants have class E vps phenotypes . Our results suggest that vacuolar delivery of Sna3p may have unique requirements . Although Ste3 - GFP , Fth1 - GFP - Ub ( Figs 6 , 8 ) and GFP - Cps1p ( data not shown ) localise to both the class E compartment and the vacuole limiting membrane in class E vps mutants , Sna3 - GFP appears to exclusively localise to the class E compartment ( Fig . 8 ) . Unlike the ubiquitin - dependent MVB sorting of other proteins ( Urbanowski and Piper , 2001 ; Katzmann et al . , 2001 ) , MVB sorting of Sna3p is ubiquitin - independent . It has been proposed that MVB sorting of Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 19 ) Fig . 8 . Vps20p and Vta1p are required for multivesicular body sorting and LY accumulation in the vacuole . The two MVB reporter proteins , Fth1 - GFP - Ub ( left ) and Sna3 - GFP ( centre ) were localised in wild - type ( SF838 - 9D ) , vps20 D ( SF838 - 9D vpl10 ) and vta1 D ( PLY3046 ) cells . For visualisation of Fth1 - GFP - Ub , cells were grown in 100 m M of the iron chelator BPS for 6 hours prior to microscopy . Cells were resuspended in 1 % sodium azide , 1 % sodium ﬂuoride , 100 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 prior to microscopy . Endocytosis of LY ( right ) was measured by incubating cells in media containing LY for 60 minutes at 30°C , washing and viewing the cells by DIC and ﬂuorescence microscopy . Bar , 5 m m . Fig . 9 . Vps20p and Vta1p are required for MVB lipid sorting . Sorting of the lipid dye NBD - PC was followed in wild - type ( SF838 - 9D ) , vps20 D ( SF838 - 9D vpl10 ) and vta1 D ( PLY3046 ) cells . Cells labelled at 30°C with FM4 - 64 ( 2 m M ) in potassium phosphate - buffered YPUAD ( pH 7 . 0 ) for 20 minutes followed by incubation with NBD - PC ( 100 m M ) for an additional 20 minutes . Cells were washed and resuspended in SD media and incubated for an additional 30 minutes at 30°C prior to ﬂuorescence microscopy . Cells were resuspended in 1 % sodium azide , 1 % sodium ﬂuoride , 100 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 prior to ﬂuorescence and DIC microscopy . Bar , 5 m m . 3969 Vps20p and Vta1p function with Vps4p Sna3p occurs via spontaneous partitioning of the Sna3p transmembrane domains into subdomains of the MVB limiting membrane that form intralumenal vesicles ( Reggiori and Pelham , 2001 ) . The unique properties of the Sna3p transmembrane domains may thus prevent Sna3p from entering endosome to vacuole transport intermediates , leading to Sna3p retention in endosomes . Alternatively , Sna3p , but not CPS , Ste3p or Fth1 - Ub , could possess the ability to recycle from the vacuole to the MVB in wild - type cells . If exit from the vacuole is relatively unaffected compared with exit from the class E compartment in class E vps mutants , Sna3p would redistribute from the vacuole to the class E compartment . Ultimately , an understanding of these sorting differences requires insight into the biological function of Sna3p , however a function for Sna3p has not yet been ascribed . We thank J .
