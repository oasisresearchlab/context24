Surveys are tagged as ' Yes ' if they found a relevant connection between the number of contacts and the determinant , as ' No ' if they did not find evidence and as ' NA ' if they did not analyze the given determinant Supplement digital content 2 for “A systematic review of social contact surveys to inform transmission models of close contact infections” Data collection tools Most surveys ( 83 % ) used paper diaries to collect contact data . Diaries were delivered and collected by mail in nine surveys [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] and in person in the remaining surveys . Six surveys exclusively used online diaries [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] , and four surveys used both online and paper diaries [ 10 , 5 , 11 , 12 ] . A Per - sonal Digital Assistant ( PDA ) was used with paper diaries in one survey in 2008 [ 13 ] . In contrast , proximity sensor devices were used with online diaries in one survey in 2012 [ 14 ] and with paper diaries in two surveys in 2013 [ 15 ] and 2014 [ 16 ] . Most of these studies primarily aimed to explore diﬀerent social contact data collecting tools . In contrast to the work of Beutel et al . ( 2006 ) [ 10 ] , which concluded that the paper diary yielded similar results of contact numbers compared with the online diary , Leung et al . [ 12 ] showed that participants using paper diary reported on average 9 · 99 contacts per day , which is substantially increased compared with those using the online diary with only 5 · 10 contacts per day . In McCaw et al . [ 13 ] , respondents preferred the paper diary compared with the PDA based on timeliness and completeness . The majority of respondents ( 63 % ) described the paper diary as easy to use , whereas only 35 % respon - dents had the same opinion regarding the use of PDA . Smiesziek et al . [ 14 ] conducted a survey at a high school using both the online diary and wearable proximity sensors , making the two sources of data comparable by matching names of contacts reported by online diaries with names associated with sen - sor ID numbers . They found the use of online diaries to be more accurate for longer duration contacts but much less accurate for short duration contacts . Mastrandrea et al . [ 15 ] and Smiesziek et al . [ 16 ] reached similar conclusions comparing paper diaries with wearable proximity sensor devices , with bet - ter accuracy for contacts of longer duration using paper diaries . However , there was a distinction in self - reported ease of use with 25 % of respondents reporting diﬃculties in remembering contacts to complete paper diaries , and 25 % stating that ﬁlling in the diary was too much work . In contrast , 93 % respondents felt comfortable having their contacts measured by sensors [ 16 ] . Data Collection methods Fifty - two of the 64 surveys ( 81 % ) , relied on self - reporting , i . e . respondents single - handedly completed a paper or online diary after receiving oral instruc - tions ( in person or via telephone ) or written guidelines from investigators . A face - to - face interview was used in nine surveys [ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] and a Computer - Assisted Telephone Interview ( CATI ) was employed in three [ 25 , 26 , 27 ] . Although self - reporting can be used for both retrospective and prospective designs , face - to - face interviews and the CATI only allow for a retrospective design , unless they are supplemented by some form of per - sonal diary keeping that is used during the interview . Akakzia et al . [ 28 ] found the paper diary to provide more number of contacts compared with CATI ( the median number of reported daily contacts per participant was 2 13 · 5 for the paper diaries and 4 for CATI ) because it gives the respondent more time to recall contacts . All four household - based surveys conducted face - to - face interviews at the respondent’s residence [ 18 , 19 , 22 , 23 ] . Face - to - face interviews exhibited a greater response rate ( 46 % [ 20 ] to 100 % [ 19 ] ) compared with self - reporting and CATI . We could not identify any contact survey directly comparing self - reporting with a face - to - face interview , but diﬀerent surveys were compared in one work [ 24 ] . 3 Figure S1 .
