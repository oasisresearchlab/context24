Recent studies have suggested that mechanobiology , the study of how physical forces inﬂuence cellular behavior , plays an important role in glioblastoma progression . Several signaling pathways , molecules , and effectors , such as focal adhesions , stretch - activated ion channels , or membrane tension variations , have been studied in this regard . Also investigated are YAP / TAZ , downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway , which is a key regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation . In glioblastoma , YAP / TAZ have been shown to promote tumor growth and invasion by regulating genes involved in cell adhesion , migration , and extracellular matrix remodeling . YAP / TAZ can be activated by mechanical cues such as cell stiffness , matrix rigidity , and cell shape changes , which are all altered in the tumor microen - vironment . Furthermore , YAP / TAZ have been shown to crosstalk with other signaling pathways , such as AKT , mTOR , and WNT , which are dysregulated in glioblastoma . Thus , understanding the role of mechanobiology and YAP / TAZ in glioblastoma progression could provide new insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies . Targeting YAP / TAZ and mechanotransduction pathways in glioblastoma may offer a promising approach to treating this deadly disease .

Introduction Cancer is a disease initiated by genetic modiﬁcations that cause uncontrolled division of abnormal cells , creating a tumor cell mass with the ability to spread to other organs . Such tumor masses develop by altering their biochemical and physical contexts [ 1 ] . Much has been described about the biochemical changes [ 2 ] , but less is known about the me - chanical modiﬁcations in cancer cells and tissues , as well as their consequences for cancer progression [ 3 ] . Looking at the macroscopic level , cancer tissue , in general , not only senses but also induces numerous physical changes in its surrounding environment . Such alterations include aberrant tissue architecture , altered material properties , increased solid stress , and elevated interstitial ﬂuid pressure ( IFP ) [ 3 ] . The most easily detectable change in cancerous tissue is its increase in stiffness , which often occurs due to an increase in both the number of cells and the deposition of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins by the tumor and its surrounding tissues . As the tumor grows , it also causes deformation and displacement of neighboring structures , leading to tensile and compressive forces that generate solid stress nearby [ 4 ] . As a consequence , it disrupts normal tissue structure and collapses blood and lymphatic vessels inside the tumor and adjacent stroma , compromising blood ﬂow and lymphatic drainage , which leads to ﬂuid accumulation and elevated IFP [ 5 ] . The increase in IFP , in turn , facilitates the ﬂow of interstitial ﬂuid from the tumor to the surrounding non - cancerous tissues , transporting tumor - secreted factors to other regions [ 5 ] . Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / diseases11020086 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / diseases Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 2 of 14 At the microscopic level , tumor and stroma cells respond to physical cues through a process known as mechanotransduction , by which mechanical inputs are converted into bio - chemical signals [ 6 ] . Several mechanisms by which tumor and stroma cells sense physical cues have been described [ 7 ] . One of the most studied is through focal adhesions [ 8 ] . Focal adhesions are complexes of multiple proteins formed by clusters of transmembrane integrin heterodimers [ 9 ] in the plasma membrane that bind to ECM proteins , such as collagen , ﬁbronectin , and laminin , and also connect to the actin cytoskeleton , using scaffolding pro - teins , such as talin and vinculin [ 10 ] . Thus , changes in external mechanical forces , usually caused by modiﬁcations in protein expression and in the structural organization of cancer cell ECM , are immediately transmitted to focal adhesions and cause alterations in their conformational proteins , e . g . , talin , thereby recruiting downstream signaling molecules that elicit biochemical responses [ 10 ] . Similarly , cell - to - cell adhesions formed between transmembrane cadherins that bind to the actin cytoskeleton through catenin proteins [ 11 ] or intermediate ﬁlament - based complexes , such as desmosomes [ 12 ] , become modiﬁed due to increase in number of cells and also induces changes in the propagation of applied forces [ 12 ] . Altogether , the modiﬁcations described can act on tumor and stroma cells , cul - minating with changes in the cytoskeleton that can impact the nucleus architecture via the LINC complex proteins [ 13 ] . The resulting deformation of the nucleus can alter chromatin packing and transport of biomolecules through nuclear pores , promoting or inhibiting the transcription of mechanoresponsive genes [ 13 ] . In addition to cytoskeleton - dependent mechanisms , stretch - activated ion channels , such as Piezo1 , transport ions from the extracel - lular space into the cytosol upon changes in membrane tension [ 14 – 16 ] , widely described as being modiﬁed in tumor / migrating cells [ 17 ] , and eliciting biochemical responses through altered intracellular ion concentrations and membrane potentials . Interestingly , changes in membrane tension can also modulate cell signaling by unfolding or refolding membrane invaginations [ 17 , 18 ] and controlling integrin - based focal adhesions at the leading edge of cells [ 19 ] . Finally , also investigated are YAP and TAZ , downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway , and key regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation [ 20 ] . It is already known that YAP and TAZ can be activated by mechanical cues such as cell stiffness , matrix rigidity , and cell shape , all altered in the tumor microenvironment [ 21 ] . Among the most studied types of cancer is glioblastoma ( GBM ) , a highly malignant primary brain tumor with presumed origin from astrocytic cells . It is the most common and aggressive form of primary brain tumor in adults , accounting for approximately 50 % of all gliomas and 15 % of all primary brain tumors [ 22 ] . Despite intensive therapeutic interventions , including surgery , radiotherapy , and chemotherapy , the prognosis remains poor , with a median survival of 15 months and a ﬁve - year survival rate of less than 10 % [ 23 ] . Studies have shown that GBM is an immensely heterogeneous tumor . The tumor mass can be divided into two large regions : a necrotic center and a border containing cells with a high migratory capacity [ 24 ] . As GBM develops , the size of the brain gradually expands , leading to an increase in intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , which is typically around 17 – 19 mmHg but can rise to 25 mmHg in later stages of GBM progression , resulting in direct mechanical stresses and solid forces between the brain tissue and skull [ 3 , 25 ] . Additionally , the water content inside the brain slightly increases during GBM progression [ 26 , 27 ] . Such a phenomenon is associated with ECM alterations and leads to cerebral edema or brain swelling [ 26 , 27 ] . GBM is not just composed of highly proliferative malignant cells , but also immune cells and inﬁltrating stromal cells , vascular endothelial cells , and pericytes , which all form distinct niches in the tumor . Within these niches , different tumor cell types ( proliferating , inﬁltrating , cancer stem cell - like ) and various non - cancerous cells ( microglia , macrophages , dendritic cells , lymphocytes ) dynamically shape different parts of the tumor . Such diversity results in different microenvironments within the tumor , ranging from solid tumor cores with densely packed proliferating cells to necrotic areas , perivascular areas around vessels with endothelial proliferation , and hypoxic regions [ 22 , 24 ] , as well as cells expressing dif - ferent stem markers , the so - called tumor - initiating cells or tumor stem cells [ 24 ] . Therefore , a better understanding of the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of GBM pro - Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 3 of 14 gression must also take into account different mechanobiological integrated experimental approaches across biological and physical sciences . Developing a better understanding of such mechanisms may pave the way for the discovery of novel therapeutics for this very aggressive type of central nervous system tumor . The present review examines the mechanobiological changes occurring in the tissue microenvironment that drive GBM progression , although the concepts discussed are rel - evant to most other solid tumors . We revise several signaling pathways , molecules , and effectors involved , such as focal adhesions , stretch - activated ion channels , and membrane tension variations . We also focus on YAP / TAZ mechanosignaling and their consequences for GBM progression . 2 . Mechanics of GBM While the majority of cancer cell invasion is primarily guided by structural cues from the ECM , GBM invasion is guided by the unique architecture and structural characteristics of the brain’s parenchyma together with its vasculature . In vivo studies using GBM mouse models have demonstrated that tumor cells associated with blood vessels and white matter tracts have higher net displacements than cells not associated with these structures , sug - gesting that they promote inﬁltration [ 28 – 30 ] . Vascular structures and white matter tracts facilitate invasion due to their divergence with the surrounding parenchyma , comprised of an isotropic ECM consisting mainly of four components : ( i ) glycosaminoglycans such as keratin sulfate , heparin sulfate , dermatan sulfate ; ( ii ) proteoglycans such as aggrecan , brevican , glypican - 1 , versican , and tenascin - C [ 31 ] ; ( iii ) ﬁbrillary glycoproteins such as collagen , ﬁbronectin , and laminin ; and ( iv ) several growth factors [ 31 ] . In contrast , white matter tracts are surrounded by a linearized ECM and , together with blood vessels , which similarly provide a linear geometry , preferentially allow GBM cell migration [ 31 ] . As GBM progression proceeds , there is an overexpression of certain brain ECM compo - nents that cause ECM stiffening [ 1 , 2 , 31 ] . In particular , the overexpression of Hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , collagen , tenascin - C , ﬁbronectin , and brevican within the GBM ECM all contribute to the stiffening process [ 32 ] . During GBM development , the stiffness of normal brain ECM ( 0 . 2 to 1 . 2 kPa ) can increase up to 45 kPa , which activates the mechanotransduction process in GBM cells [ 33 – 35 ] . Such ECM - stiffening capacity to activate mechanosignaling processes can independently stimulate GBM aggression , contributing to GBM recurrence even in IDH1 - mutant lower - grade glioma cells via a tension - dependent positive feed - back loop mechanism that reduces miR - 203 suppression of HIF1 α , stimulating tenascin - C expression [ 36 ] . Overexpression of HA also signiﬁcantly alters the mechanics of the brain tissue [ 37 ] , while increased collagen expression promotes aligned microarchitecture in the ECM struc - ture [ 38 ] . Fibronectin expression also increases and promotes cell adhesion properties [ 39 ] . Furthermore , an altered ECM in GBM facilitates matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity , which degrades ECM proteins and weakens the ECM’s mechanical properties , opposing the stiffening phenomena [ 40 ] . Consequently , the structure of the ECM changes , forming a conﬁned space with an aligned microarchitecture [ 41 , 42 ] . Such modiﬁcations resemble the linear structure of white matter tracts and blood vessels and thus promote a later increase in the migratory and invasive states of GBM cells [ 41 , 42 ] . As the brain ECM stiffness increases , it activates mechanosensors in GBM cells , which transmit forces via chemical signals [ 9 , 43 ] . However , it is crucial to note that GBM cells often develop abnormalities in their mechanosensory machinery , including abnormal expression of important molecular components . Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , a critical mechanosensory protein , is often overexpressed in many GBM tumors [ 44 ] . Moreover , GBM frequently exhibits a modiﬁed expression of integrins , which are crucial for the physical transmission of force from the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and for mediating attachment to the ECM [ 45 – 47 ] . Increased ECM stiffness is known to stimulate the formation of focal adhesion complexes in GBM cells , which are rich in integrin adhesion receptors and play a crucial role in bidirectional transmembrane communication . The Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 4 of 14 dynamic assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions are central to cell migration , with both the composition and morphology of the focal adhesion continuously reorganizing [ 48 ] . F - actin is another key component in GBM mechanotransduction [ 34 , 49 ] and is greatly inﬂuenced by mechanical stress [ 3 ] . Integrins at focal adhesion sites enable F - actin to detect the stiffness of the extracellular matrix , which can then modulate its polymeriza - tion . Upon activation of several mechanosensors , cell cytoskeleton remodeling rose as the hallmark of the adaptive response of GBM cells to ECM alterations and applied mechan - ical stresses [ 3 , 50 , 51 ] . The remodeling of the cytoskeleton favors GBM invasiveness and facilitates its migratory state [ 50 ] . As GBM cells inﬁltrate the brain tissue , they employ various modes of motility that depend on the local microenvironment . These modes differ in speed and molecular mecha - nisms , but all involve adhesion and force transmission between the cytoskeleton and ECM . CD44 , an adhesion receptor for HA , is crucial for GBM cells to navigate through the brain parenchyma [ 52 , 53 ] . CD44 allows GBM cells to engage and transduce mechanical signals from HA [ 54 ] . Studies have shown that the interaction between CD44 and HA contributes to GBM pathogenesis by promoting tumor cell survival , proliferation , and invasion . For instance , CD44 - HA interaction activates Rho GTPases , leading to the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of cell protrusions , such as invadopodia , that facilitate tumor cell invasion [ 55 ] . Moreover , CD44 - HA interaction activates downstream signaling pathways , such as the PI3K / Akt and MAPK / ERK , which promote tumor cell proliferation and survival [ 55 ] . Apart from cytoskeletal changes involved in GBM proliferation , survival , and invasion , Chen and collaborators [ 56 ] have identiﬁed a crucial mechanosignaling pathway that involves the Piezo1 ion channel , overexpressed in various types and grades of cancer , including GBM . The authors have shown that the Piezo1 channel is necessary for tumor growth in vitro and in vivo . In mouse models , inhibiting the ion channel has resulted in signiﬁcantly longer survival and reduced tumor growth [ 56 ] . Further investigation revealed that Piezo1 acts as a central hub in a mechanotransduction cascade , with the channel located at sites of focal adhesion . Moreover , the same authors have also demonstrated a feed - forward mechanism , whereby Piezo1 regulates other ECM remodeling genes , including TAZ and FHL3 . In experiments with Piezo1 knockdown , stiffness - dependent GBM cell growth was not observed . Additionally , in experiments using varying stiffness hydrogels to assess the stiffness - dependent growth of GBM cells , increased expression of Piezo1 was observed [ 56 ] . Overall , our understanding of how mechanical stimuli are transduced in GBM is still limited , but recent progress revealed some insights into the interactions between the microenvironment and cellular networks that underlie the effects of mechanical properties on disease progression . It is clear now that mechanical stimuli transduction in GBM can be broadly classiﬁed into those involving mechanosensitive ion channels and those involving non - ion channel - based mechanotransduction ; the latter includes a complex array of poorly understood signaling pathways such as integrin signaling , ligand - mediated signaling through interaction with ECM components , receptor - mediated signaling through interaction with ECM components [ 57 ] , the Hippo signaling pathway ( better detailed in the following sections ) and , much less understood , the effects of membrane tension changes [ 17 , 19 ] in inhibiting cancer cell migration and invasion [ 18 ] . 3 . The Hippo Signaling Pathway The Hippo signaling pathway controls the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis , and this balance is critical for tissue homeostasis at different stages of embryonic development , in aging processes , and in several diseases . In embryonic tissues , during development , it acts by controlling the correct size of organs and , when uncontrolled , can lead to tumorigenic processes . The ﬁrst components of the Hippo signaling pathway were cloned and characterized in the 1990s [ 58 ] ; however , it was only in the early 2000s that its signaling cascade began to be unraveled [ 20 , 59 , 60 ] and its functions more clariﬁed . Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 5 of 14 The Hippo pathway gets its name from the effect of mutations in this gene in Drosophila melanogaster . Knockout ﬂies for Hippo showed tissue overgrowth . Deletion of the Hippo gene caused an increase in proliferation and a decrease in apoptosis by increasing the expression of the target genes cyclin E and the inhibitor of cell death , diap1 [ 20 ] . The Hippo protein in humans is MST 1 / 2 , a serine - threonine kinase that complexes with the Salvador homolog 1 ( SAV1 ) protein and phosphorylates LATS 1 / 2 protein [ 59 ] . When phosphorylated , LATS 1 / 2 kinases phosphorylate the Hippo pathway effectors , YAP ( Yes - associated protein ) , and TAZ ( Transcriptional activator with PDZ - binding motif ) . Phosphorylated YAP and TAZ remain retained and inactive in the cytoplasm . However , when dephosphorylated , YAP and TAZ go to the nucleus , where they associate with TEAD or other transcription factors to activate cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis [ 61 ] . This signaling cascade is considered the core or downstream part of the Hippo pathway ( Figure 1 ) . Upstream from MST 1 / 2 , the Hippo pathway does not have a single pathway ; it is regulated by a large number of signals , such as cell polarity proteins , cell density , and mechanical forces [ 62 ] . In Drosophila , cells with apicobasal polarity have the protein complex located in their apical region , upstream of Warts ( LAST in vertebrates ) , formed by kibra , Merlin ( NF2 in vertebrates ) , and Expanded ( Ex ) [ 63 ] . Kibra and Merlin bind and phosphorylate Warts , preventing their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation resulting in the activation of these kinases leading to phosphorylation and inactivation of Yorkie ( YAP and TAZ in vertebrates ) [ 64 ] . This mechanism is Hippo - independent ( MST 1 / 2 in vertebrates ) and appears to be conserved in some cell types in vertebrates [ 65 ] . In invertebrates and vertebrates , MST 1 / 2 interacts with the STRIPAK complex containing the sarcolemmal membrane – associated protein ( SLMAP ) [ 66 ] . STRIPAK is a large protein complex formed by a catalytic subunit PP2A and the regulatory subunit Striatin ( STRN ) that recruits other proteins , including the SLMAP protein . STRIPAK complex interacts with MST 1 / 2 , activating the Hippo pathway [ 66 ] . On the other hand , evidence shows that , in HEK293A cells , MST 1 / 2 is not essential for the activation of the pathway , but LATs 1 / 2 is . MST 1 / 2 deletion in 293T cells did not abolish YAP phosphorylation , whereas it is completely abolished in LATS 1 / 2 deleted cells . A screening to identify candidates that directly phosphorylate LATS 1 / 2 identiﬁed that MAP4K family kinases are responsible for phosphorylating LATS 1 / 2 acting in parallel with MST 1 / 2 [ 67 ] . Several reports , however , have provided substantial evidence indicating that cellular mechanotransduction is also a crucial factor in the regulation of YAP and TAZ . Importantly , and with few exceptions , this regulation was mostly described as capable of occurring independently of LATS 1 / 2 [ 21 , 68 ] . What is remarkable is that YAP / TAZ are capable of interpreting a wide range of mechanical signals and converting them into specific biological effects tailored to each cell type and mechanical stress . For example , in cells with low levels of mechanical signaling , such as rounded cells attached to a soft ECM ( typically less than 1 . 5 kPa for epithelial cells ) or cells attached to a small adhesive area ( approximately 300 µ m 2 ) , YAP / TAZ are primarily localized in the cytoplasm [ 21 , 68 ] . Conversely , in cells experiencing high levels of mechanical signaling , such as those cultured on rigid substrates ( usually over 5 – 10 kPa ) or subjected to increased cytoskeletal tension ( cells spread over an area exceeding 3000 µ m 2 ) , YAP / TAZ are predominantly found in the nucleus [ 21 , 68 ] . In addition , YAP / TAZ are subject to mechanical regulation through various forms of deformation , such as those originating from epithelial monolayers or the deformability of the ECM that supports cellular outgrowths [ 21 , 68 , 69 ] . In these contexts , YAP / TAZ not only senses cell and tissue mechanics but also play a crucial role in mediating the biological effects associated with mechanical signaling . This mechanotransduction process of YAP / TAZ has mostly been described as dependent on the actomyosin cytoskeleton , particularly on the specific organization of the F - actin cytoskeleton and on the contractile forces of non - muscle myosin II [ 21 , 70 ] ( Figure 1 ) . YAP / TAZ signaling can also be modulated by integrins , adherens junctions , other adhe - sion proteins , and GTPases , which connect the extracellular mechanical environment to the actomyosin cytoskeleton [ 71 – 73 ] . However , a crucial aspect that remains unsolved in the field is the connection between actomyosin architecture and the localization and activation Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 6 of 14 of YAP / TAZ . Efforts in this direction have shown that a key step that allows YAP / TAZ to enter the nucleus is the opening of nuclear pores through nucleo - cytoskeletal coupling [ 74 ] ( Figure 1 ) . In addition , particularly regarding GTPases , Meng and colleagues [ 73 ] demon - strated that a Ras - related GTPase known as RAP2 serves as an intracellular signal transducer , transmitting signals of ECM rigidity to control mechanosensitive cellular activities through YAP / TAZ . Mechanistically , the authors showed that matrix stiffness exerts its influence through phospholipase C γ 1 , affecting the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid , activating RAP2 via RAPGEF2 and RAPGEF6 . When stiffness is low , active RAP2 binds to and stimulates MAP4K4 , MAP4K6 , MAP4K7 , and ARHGAP29 , conse - quently leading to the activation of LATS1 / 2 and inhibition of YAP / TAZ [ 73 ] . The signaling cascade described above integrates mechanical signals with LATS 1 / 2 and YAP / TAZ , differ - ently from what has been widely described , although there is yet no established consensus in the literature on this subject ( Figure 1 ) . Diseases 2021 , 9 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 15 Figure 1 . Schematic of the Hippo pathway and YAP / TAZ mechanosignaling . When cells encounter a rigid ECM , they respond by adjusting their cytoskeletal tension through integrin - mediated focal adhesions , which link the ECM to the intracellular F - actin cytoskeleton , involving important kinases such as FAK and other adhesion proteins such as Vinculin and Talin . This process leads to an in - crease in actomyosin tension and a reorganization of the cytoskeleton . Key components such as RhoA and myosin II motors are also required for this tension - mediated restructuring . The modula - tion of YAP / TAZ nuclear - cytoplasmic shuttling occurs in response to actomyosin tension , which transduces physical cues into cellular signals . The F - actin cytoskeleton also inﬂuences the mechan - ical properties and shape of the nucleus , promoting the nuclear entry of YAP / TAZ by inducing nu - clear deformation , facilitated by the stretching of nuclear pore complexes . The Hippo pathway acts as a negative regulator of YAP / TAZ by directly phosphorylating these proteins through LATS1 / LA TS2 or indirectly by inﬂuencing the actin cytoskeleton . Conversely , actomyosin contrac - tility can impact the activity of LATS1 / LATS2 through the GTPase RAP2 . Finally , compounds that are capable of inﬂuencing some stage of this intricate signaling pathway are highlighted in red squares . Several reports , however , have provided substantial evidence indicating that cellular mechanotransduction is also a crucial factor in the regulation of YAP and TAZ . Im - portantly , and with few exceptions , this regulation was mostly described as capable of Figure 1 . Schematic of the Hippo pathway and YAP / TAZ mechanosignaling .

Conversely , actomyosin contractility can impact the activity of LATS1 / LATS2 through the GTPase RAP2 . Finally , compounds that are capable of inﬂuencing some stage of this intricate signaling pathway are highlighted in red squares . Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 7 of 14 The Hippo pathway is also regulated by cell density and cell - to - cell contact . When epithelial cells reach conﬂuence in culture , the Hippo pathway is activated , and YAP leaves the nucleus and is located in the cytoplasm , suspending cell division . Unlike the control of the cytoskeletal stress and tension ﬁber - dependent pathway , the control of the Hippo pathway by cell density is carried out by the cascade involving activation of MST 1 / 2 and LAST 1 / 2 kinases [ 75 ] . The ability of YAP / TAZ to respond to these diverse mechanical inputs highlights their pivotal role as universal mechanotransducers and mechanoeffectors . Moreover , their involvement offers novel perspectives into the interpretation and comprehension of fundamental elements of tissue physiology and pathology at a molecular level . In this context , the identiﬁcation of YAP and TAZ as mechanotransducers is ﬁnally uncovering the contribution of abnormal cell mechanics to the development of various diseases , such as cancer . In this sense , there are currently few therapy strategies to directly and / or indirectly target the YAP / TAZ signaling ( Figure 1 ) . A detailed description of such strategies was elegantly reviewed in [ 76 ] . Verteporﬁn was the ﬁrst compound discovered to inhibit YAP - TEAD binding and reduce organ overgrowth , although it is not an ideal clinical inhibitor due to its limited efﬁcacy and unrelated effects . Other compounds that inhibit YAP - TEAD association , such as IAG933 by Novartis ( NCT04857372 ) , are currently in phase I clinical trial . Another way to inhibit the YAP / TAZ activity is by targeting YAP / TAZ expression directly by using antisense nucleotide methods . In this sense , ION537 by Ionis Pharmaceuticals ( NCT04659096 ) , currently in phase I clinical trial , has demonstrated great efﬁciency . Targeting TEAD directly to inhibit or disrupt YAP – TEAD complex is also under consideration . An example of such an alternative is VT3989 , a compound developed by Vivace Therapeutics and also in phase I clinical trial ( NC04665206 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Some drugs indirectly inhibit YAP / TAZ by targeting their upstream regulators , while others affect downstream molecules . For example , statins inhibit YAP nuclear translocation and enhance sensitivity to certain cancer drugs [ 77 ] , while inhibitors of the BRD4 proteins are also under test , but the available data are insufﬁcient to make conclusions for the moment [ 78 ] . Statins have also demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the growth of tumor xenografts , although their effectiveness appears to be more pronounced in vitro than in vivo . Some epidemiological studies have suggested that patients undergoing statin therapy have a reduced risk of developing cancer , although conﬂicting ﬁndings exist , highlighting the need for further investigations to evaluate the potential of these drugs in cancer treatment and prevention [ 77 ] . Targeting the regulation of YAP / TAZ by the cytoskeleton holds promise as a potential approach for developing anti - cancer therapies . Studies have indicated that the mechanical activation of YAP / TAZ in cancer cells plays a role in the development of chemoresistance [ 79 ] . However , the toxicity associated with anti - cytoskeletal treatments limits current therapeutic options ( Figure 1 ) . Thus , continuous efforts are still needed to develop other more efﬁcient inhibitors of the YAP / TAZ / TEAD complexes , although promising ones are already under evaluation . 4 . Hippo Signaling in GBM Due to its role in controlling the balance between cell proliferation , apoptosis , resis - tance to chemotherapy , and metastasis [ 80 , 81 ] , the Hippo pathway has been extensively studied over the years in various types of tumors . In the developing brain , the Hippo pathway effector , YAP1 , is expressed in regions known as neural stem cell niches , the subventricular zone , and the external granular cell layer of the cerebellum [ 82 ] . In neural precursors of the granular layer of the cerebellum ( Cerebellar granule neural precursors ) , the Sonic Hedgehog ( Shh ) pathway induces the nuclear localization of YAP that stimu - lates the proliferation of these cells [ 83 ] . Histological staining of samples from several types of astrocytomas demonstrated that YAP nuclear staining is common in almost all , including GBM , but uncommon in pilocytic astrocytoma [ 82 ] . TAZ is also overexpressed in GBM and stimulates cell proliferation and migration , and decreases apoptosis [ 84 ] . Xu Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 8 of 14 and colleagues demonstrated that CD44 depletion in glioblastoma cells is responsible for activating the Hippo pathway , inhibiting tumor growth in vivo and in vitro , as well as sensitizing glioblastoma to temozolomide treatment [ 85 ] . CD44 binds to Merlin / NF2 , and this interaction inhibits the binding of CD44 to HA . Merlin is downregulated in GBM , favoring CD44 binding with HA . Merlin / NF2 overexpression induces the activation of MST 1 / 2 and LATS 1 / 2 , activating the Hippo pathway and inhibiting intracranial GBM growth [ 86 ] . The Hippo pathway in GBM also does not seem to follow a linear path , suggesting a large number of crosstalks with other signaling pathways . MST 1 / 2 depletion in GBM does not affect YAP activation but rather inhibits AKT and , consequently , mTOR [ 87 ] . The Hippo pathway is also involved in GBM response to radiotherapy . After treatment with ionizing radiation , the ﬁrst response of GBM cells is the arrest of proliferation [ 88 ] . While the ﬁrst response to ionizing radiation treatment involves the modulation of genes involved in apoptosis , cell cycle , and DNA repair , the long - term response involves genes that lead to cell senescence . One of the genes whose expression is inhibited by ionizing radiation is TAZ ; however , this inhibition does not occur by the activation of LATS 1 / 2 , but by inhibition of the WNT pathway . GBM cells treated with ionizing radiation have the WNT pathway inhibited and , therefore , the β - catenin destruction complex marks it for proteasome degradation . This same complex is responsible for the decrease in TAZ levels as a long - term effect of treatment [ 89 ] . Minata and colleagues demonstrated , however , that there is a difference between GBM stem cells located at the edge compared to those located in the center of the tumor . Cells of the invading edge preferentially express CD133 , and when these cells are irradiated , they begin to express CD109 , a marker preferentially expressed in the center of the tumor and leading to increased expression of YAP / TAZ target genes [ 90 ] . GBM has been categorized into four distinct molecular subgroups : proneural ( PN ) , neural ( NL ) , classical ( CL ) , and mesenchymal ( MES ) [ 91 ] . Each subgroup is characterized by speciﬁc molecular alterations , response to therapy , and prognosis , making this classiﬁcation crucial for guiding targeted treatment strategies . Among these subtypes , the MES subgroup is particularly aggressive and associated with a signiﬁcantly worse prognosis compared to PN . Bhat and colleagues [ 92 ] provided compelling evidence demonstrating the role of TAZ in driving the MES phenotype observed in GBMs . These authors demonstrated that TAZ undergoes epigenetic silencing in PN GBMs , as compared to MES subtypes , and by manipulating TAZ expression in glioma stem cells and murine neural stem cells , they observed signiﬁcant alterations in the expression of MES genes [ 92 ] . The ﬁndings implicate TAZ as a critical mediator in facilitating the transition toward the mesenchymal state in GBM . YAP and TAZ are also required for the transformation of astrocytes ( Figure 2 ) . Mouse newborn astroglial cells were transfected with different oncogenes , and all induced activa - tion of the YAP / TAZ reporter plasmid ( 8xGTIIC - RFP - DD ) . These same oncogenes are not able to induce the formation of oncospheres in astroglial cells depleted of YAP and TAZ [ 93 ] . These oncospheres were able to form a tumor mass with similar glioblastoma characteristics when implanted in a mouse brain with strong activation of TAZ in perinecrotic areas , as previously described [ 93 ] . Moreover , HER2 overexpression in astroglial cells induces the downregulation of astrocyte markers and upregulation of neural stem cell markers [ 93 ] in a YAP / TAZ - dependent manner . Taking advantage of a plastic characteristic of GBM cells , Castellan and coworkers tested the ability of Hu Tu 10 and Hu Tu 13 cell lines ( primary GBM cell lines ) to differentiate into an astrocytic phenotype by BMP2 induction or return to an undifferentiated state by placing cells in de - differentiation serum - free medium . Under these conditions , YAP / TAZ depletion prevented de - differentiation , and cells persisted with astroglial - like phenotypes even in the de - differentiation medium [ 93 ] . Taken together , these results show that YAP / TAZ are key factors in initiating the transformation of astroglial cells , and their inhibition can prevent one of the main obstacles to the treatment of glioblas - Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 9 of 14 toma , which is the presence of cells with stem phenotypes that are resistant to treatment ( Figure 2 ) . Diseases 2021 , 9 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 15 Figure 2 . YAP / TAZ are key elements for maintaining the stem cell initiator state within GBM . GBM stem cells have an intrinsic plasticity that allows them to diﬀerentiate into astroglial cells or to ex - press stem markers depending on the culture medium used ( diﬀerentiation medium or de - diﬀeren - tiation medium ) . YAP / TAZ inhibition maintains glioblastoma cells in a diﬀerentiated state without returning to the stem state , even when placed in a de - diﬀerentiation medium . These diﬀerentiated cells are not capable of forming gliomaspheres and are less aggressive , preventing tumor progres - sion . 5 . Conclusions and Perspectives Altogether , several studies have demonstrated that YAP and TAZ are activated in GBM and promote tumor growth and invasion . Thus , targeting YAP / TAZ signaling emerges as a promising strategy for GBM therapy . Several small molecules and peptides have been developed that inhibit YAP and TAZ activity [ 76 , 94 ] and could be used in com - bination with other therapies , such as radiation or chemotherapy , to treat GBM . Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of YAP and TAZ regulation in GBM and to develop more eﬀective YAP / TAZ direct or indirect inhibitors . Another possible therapeutic approach is to manipulate the mechanical properties of the microenvironment to create anti - GBM conditions [ 95 – 97 ] . This approach may allow for the development of “smart” therapies that can locally or globally change mechanical properties to target the tumor [ 95 – 97 ] . Bioengineering strategies have been used in many studies to create a microenvironment - mimetic substrate to alter physical forces felt by cells , resulting in the elimination of malignant properties . In the future , this concept could be applied as a treatment by implanting engineered materials into tumor resection cavities after surgery , which respond to chemical and physical stimuli from surrounding brain tissue [ 98 – 100 ] . However , it requires further study and is yet to be developed for clinical application in GBM . Additionally , a more robust understanding of tissue mechanics to - gether with other mechanosignaling pathways , such as those from Piezo1 ion channels and / or membrane tension , can also help pave the way for designing novel therapies that Figure 2 .

Exploring the mechanical characteristics of the GBM microenvironment is highly promising . As we gain more insights into the Diseases 2023 , 11 , 86 10 of 14 mechanobiological aspects of the microenvironment , we can better comprehend the disease progression , which can lead to innovative therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities , as well as better preclinical modeling to come close to a cure for this very aggressive tumor .
