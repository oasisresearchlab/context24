J o u r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Membrane curvature at a glance Harvey T . McMahon 1 , * and Emmanuel Boucrot 2 , * ABSTRACT Membrane curvature is an important parameter in defining the morphology of cells , organelles and local membrane subdomains . Transport intermediates have simpler shapes , being either spheres or tubules . The generation and maintenance of curvature is of central importance for maintaining trafficking and cellular functions . It is possible that local shapes in complex membranes could help to define local subregions . In this Cell Science at a Glance article and accompanying poster , we summarize how generating , sensing and maintaining high local membrane curvature is an active process that is mediated and controlled by specialized proteins using general mechanisms : ( i ) changes in lipid composition and asymmetry , ( ii ) partitioning of shaped transmembrane domains of integral membrane proteins or protein or domain crowding , ( iii ) reversible insertion of hydrophobicproteinmotifs , ( iv ) nanoscopic scaffolding by oligomerized hydrophilic protein domains and , finally , ( v ) macroscopic scaffolding by the cytoskeleton with forces generated by polymerization and by molecular motors . We also summarize some of the discoveries about the functions of membrane curvature , where in addition to providing cell or organelle shape , local curvature can affect processes like membrane scission and fusion as well as protein concentration and enzyme activation on membranes .

Because membranes are constantly turned over by trafficking intermediates ( vesicles or tubules ) , the ability to generate high - curvature compartments is necessary for eukaryotic life . Lipid bilayers forming eukaryotic cell membranes have elastic properties that make them resistant to spontaneous bending and , thus , active mechanisms are required to shape them ; these have been conserved throughout evolution . Many proteins contain domains or motifs that are specialized in sensing , generating or stabilizing membrane curvature . In addition , there are proteins that act directly by changing lipids , whereas others provide scaffolding and forces that impose tension on membranes . Mechanisms of membrane curvature generation and stabilization Change in lipid composition and asymmetry Lipids have intrinsic shapes depending on the size of their headgroups and their acyl chain compositions ( length and saturation ) . These features determine their side - by - side packing , thereby imposing a shape on the monolayer . If many lipids with similar shape cluster together , then a monolayer will adopt the spontaneous curvature of the local lipids . Owing to bilayer coupling , the whole membrane might also change shape ( see poster ) ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Cooke and Deserno , 2006 ) . Thus a bilayer will adopt a spontaneous curvature equal to the difference between the spontaneous curvatures of its inner and outer monolayers , which are themselves dictated by the weighted average of the spontaneous curvature of their constituent lipids ( Kozlov et al . , 1992 ; Leikin et al . , 1996 ) . Phosphatidylcholine ( PtdCho ) and phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ) are cylindrical lipids that form a flat monolayer . Lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine ( PtdEtn ) , phosphatic acid , diacylglycerol ( DAG ) or cardiolipin , which have a smaller polar headgroup than that of PtdCho , have a roughly conical shape and thus impose a negative curvature , where a monolayer with such lipids bends in such a fashion that the headgroups come closer together . Conversely , a large headgroup to acyl chain ratio , such as in lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) or the large headgroups in phosphatidylinositol phosphates ( PtdIns ) confers an inverted conical shape to the lipids , thereby favoring the bending of the membrane into a positive curvature , bending the monolayer away from the headgroups ( reviewed in Chernomordik and Kozlov , 2003 ; Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Zimmerberg and Kozlov , 2006 ) . Acyl chain saturation also influences lipid geometry ; any double bond ( such as in oleic acid ) induces a kink in the chain and thus forces it to occupy more space than its saturated counterpart . Thus , the ratio between the size of the polar headgroup and acyl chain saturation defines the overall geometry of the lipids ( Vanni et al . , 2014 ; Pinot et al . , 2014 ) . The artificial combination of a bulky headgroup and monounsaturation of both acyl chains , such as in the artificial lipids 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoserine ( DOPS ) or Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS , favors spontaneous curvature ( Bigay and Antonny , 2012 ) . Conversely , sterols increase the packing of cylindrical sphingolipids ( such as sphingomyelin ) and of PtdCho , and thus disfavor spontaneous curvature ( Ikonen , 2008 ) . Active maintenance of lipid asymmetry by type IV P - type ATPases ( lipid flippases ) that translocate phospholipids ( e . g . PtdSer or PtdEtn ) directionally from the extracellular leaflet to the cytosolic face ( Daleke , 2007 ; Devaux et al . , 2008 ) supports changes in membrane curvature and vesicular budding by generating a difference in the partitioning of lipids between the two leaflets ( Poulsen et al . , 2008 ; Ruaud et al . , 2009 ; Xu et al . , 2009 ) . Changes in the lipid composition of one monolayer by lysophospholipid acyltransferases , phospholipase A or sphingomyelinases also induce local membrane curvature ( reviewed in Graham and Kozlov , 2010 ) . Finally , the clustering of certain lipids by bacterial toxins , such as cholera toxin B or Shiga toxin B , favors the concentration of lipids with the same shape ( conical , inverted conical or cylindrical ; see poster ) on one leaflet and coincides with the generation of negative membrane curvature ( Ewers et al . , 2010 ; Ro¨mer et al . , 2007 ) . Partitioning of shaped transmembrane domains and protein crowding Transmembrane proteins ( ion channels , transporters and receptors ) that have an intrinsic conical or inverted conical shape can bend their associated membranes ( Aimon et al . , 2014 ; Fertuck and Salpeter , 1974 ; Fribourg et al . , 2014 ; MacKinnon , 2003 ; Unwin , 2005 ) . The asymmetry of extramembrane domains of transmembrane proteins might also result in bending . Thus , receptors might cause membrane bending by protein crowding where the membrane bends away from the side with the largest domains ( Copic et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , many integral membrane proteins oligomerize – either directly among themselves or through connecting proteins ( Boudin et al . , 2000 ; Eckler et al . , 2005 ) , which results in local scaffolding of membranes . The clustering of transmembrane receptors , such as transferrin or low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptors , into forming endocytic pits supports the generation of membrane curvature by stabilizing forming clathrin - coated pits ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) . These mechanisms might play a role in sorting receptors into ( or excluding them from ) membrane trafficking carriers . A high local concentration of proteins that bind to the membrane surface has been suggested to induce membrane curvature by a crowding mechanism ( Stachowiak et al . , 2012 ) , although the contribution of this mechanism is still unclear ( recently discussed in Kozlov et al . , 2014 ) . Insertion of hydrophobic protein motifs Insertion of a small hydrophobic protein motif in between the lipid headgroups is a very efficient way of inducing local membrane curvature ( see poster ) . It acts as a ‘wedge’ ; given that the shallow insertion is in the outer part of the membrane , this means that the apex of the wedge is in the center of the bilayer and , thus , the radius of curvature is small ( the thickness of the monolayer ) ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) . If there is a single insertion , the bending of the membrane is dissipated rapidly in space , but if several insertions are held in close proximity ( within the same protein or within complex protein assemblies ) , the resulting membrane curvature is much more pronounced ( Campelo et al . , 2008 ; McMahon et al . , 2010 ) . Amphipathic helices are present in many proteins that are involved in membrane remodeling throughout the entire cell , such as epsin , endophilin , amphiphysin , Bin2 , nadrin ( also known as ARHGAP17 ) , Arf proteins , Sar1 and atlastin GTPases , GRK5 , ArfGAP1 , ArfGEF GBF1 , GMAP - 210 ( also known as TRIP11 ) , NUP133 , barkor , a - synuclein , annexin B12 , Atg3 and the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRT ) - III protein CHMP4B ( reviewed in Drin and Antonny , 2010 ) . Amphipathic helices vary in lengths and in their affinities for charged lipids ( dictated by the CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 1065 – 1070 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 114454 1066 J o u r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e nature of the amino acids on the edges of the hydrophobic face of the helix ) , and thus have varying abilities to sense or induce membrane curvature . Several bacterial proteins , such as DivIVA or SpoVM , use amphipathic helices for their subcellular targeting , suggesting that curvature sensing is a very ancient mechanism ( Lenarcic et al . , 2009 ; Ramamurthi et al . , 2009 ) . The insertion of hydrophobic loops that are present at the tip of the C2 domains of synaptotagmin - 1 and Doc2b ( Groffen et al . , 2010 ; Hui et al . , 2009 ; Martens et al . , 2007 ) or at the membrane - binding interface of Pacsin and EHD2 also induce membrane curvature by acting as wedges ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ; Plomann et al . , 2010 ) ; although , in the latter case , protein oligomerization and scaffolding also contribute to the generation of curvature . Consistent with their extensive insertion into the lipid bilayer , C2 domains induce a high degree of curvature ( McMahon et al . , 2010 ) . As C2 domains bind to membrane in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner , their membrane bending activity is tightly regulated ( Hui et al . , 2009 ; Martens et al . , 2007 ) . Nanoscopic scaffolding by oligomerized hydrophilic protein domains Scaffolding by peripheral proteins supports membrane curvature at a nanoscopic level ( curvature on the scale of protein domains ) , whereby the shape of the membrane - binding interface is imposed on the membrane . Nanoscopic proteins might also assemble into larger structures that have a shape that is formed by the oligomer and thus affect membrane curvature at the microscopic level . Protein oligomerization Coat proteins such as clathrin , COPI and COPII are key factors that stabilize membrane curvature during vesicle budding ( Jensen and Schekman , 2011 ; Kirchhausen , 2000 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Zanetti et al . , 2012 ) . They do not bind to membrane directly and rely on adaptor proteins to link them to membranes ( see poster ) . The capacity of the coat proteins to bend to membranes depends on the rigidity of the assembled polyhedral coat and the transmission of this shape to the membrane ( Copic et al . , 2012 ) . Members of the dynamin GTPase superfamily induce membrane curvature by self - polymerizing into spirals ( reviewed in Faelber et al . , 2012 ; Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; Morlot and Roux , 2013 ; Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ) . However , dynamin requires a pre - existing curvature to assemble efficiently , at least in the presence of membrane tension . Proteins such as caveolin , flotillins or the reticulons oligomerize ( directly or through bridging proteins ) as well as insert into membranes , thereby facilitating the formation or stabilization of curvature at caveolae and the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , respectively ( Hu et al . , 2011 ; Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ; Shibata et al . , 2009 ) . BAR domains BAR ( Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ) domains are crescent - shaped dimeric modules that bind to membranes . The prototypical BAR domain protein is amphiphysin , which binds to membrane through its concave face ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . The initial binding is mediated by electrostatic interaction between positively charged amino acids ( lysine or arginine ) of the BAR module and negatively charged lipids [ PtdSer and / or phosphatidylinositol phosphates , such as PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] ( Mim and Unger , 2012 ; Rao and Haucke , 2011 ) . Some BAR domains can further oligomerise by forming ‘tip - to - tip’ or ‘side - to - side’ interactions , thereby increasing their local concentration , which makes it more likely that they can impose their intrinsic curvature locally on the membrane ( Mim and Unger , 2012 ; Rao and Haucke , 2011 ) . BAR domains favor the formation of membrane tubules and disfavor the more extreme curvature needed for membrane scission ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) . Macroscopic scaffolding by the cytoskeleton Scaffolding by the actin , intermediate filament and microtubule cytoskeleton supports cell membrane curvature at the macroscopic scale ( in the range of multiple microns in radius ) , which is present in large intracellular organelles , such as the Golgi or the ER . The cytoskeleton also mediates the macroscopic curvature of the plasma membrane in filopodia and lamellipodia , or of the specific arrangement of the plasma membrane during cell division ( i . e . cortical actin supporting mitotic cell rounding ) , phagocytosis ( membrane ruffling ) or in specialized cellular shapes ( neurons or visual cones ) ( Rohn and Baum , 2010 ; Sheetz , 2001 ) . The cytoskeleton maintains cell membrane tension by connecting to the bilayer at regular intervals , and it imposes macroscopic shapes by providing an underlying scaffold ( Doherty and McMahon , 2008 ) . Active membrane pulling or pushing by kinesins , dynein and myosin also induces considerable membrane reorganization and supports some of the organelle morphologies ( e . g . ER , Golgi and endosomes ) ( reviewed in Leduc et al . , 2010 ) . Synergistic action of multiple mechanisms A combination of several of the aforementioned mechanisms usually takes place to efficiently induce membrane sculpting . Proteins with insertion motifs , scaffolding abilities or both bind to numerous other proteins that are involved in the same cellular process and , thus , form a network of interactions that combine sensing , induction and stabilization of curvature ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) . For example , during the formation of a clathrin - coated pit , several of the membrane - bending mechanisms presented above take place . The asymmetrical partitioning of inverted conical lipids [ PtdSer and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] between the two membrane leaflets and their clustering by several proteins – some of which have , in addition , membrane inserting ( epsin ) or scaffolding modules ( amphiphysin ) – all occur within an oligomeric protein scaffold that is being held together by the clathrin coat ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . Functions of membrane curvature The control of biological membrane shapes is central to eukaryotic life . Thus , the formation of high - curvature transport intermediates is necessary for compartmentalization , and the characteristic shapes of organelles are likely to be related to their function ; indeed , the ability to control fission and fusion , local tethering or enzyme reactions might also be shape dependent ( see poster ; reviewed in McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Shibata et al . , 2009 ) . Organelle shaping Most intracellular organelles have characteristic membrane shapes that make them easily recognizable by their morphology in electron micrographs . These shapes are mediated by the extent and localization of membrane curvature , which give rise to the typical shapes of the ER , the Golgi , mitochondria , lipid droplets , autophagosomes or endosomal and secretory carriers ( Shibata et al . , 2009 ) . However , these characteristic shapes are dynamic , and they change according to the needs of the cell ( e . g . mitochondrial fission or fusion ) or the maturation of the CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 1065 – 1070 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 114454 1067 J o u r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e organelle ( e . g . formation or consumption of endocytic or synaptic vesicles ) ( Friedman and Nunnari , 2014 ; Haucke et al . , 2011 ; Rafelski and Marshall , 2008 ) . Membrane scission Scission between two membranes requires the localized and timely connection in trans of two bilayer membranes to separate an organelle from its membrane of origin , while avoiding leakiness . Membrane scission is a key step in the budding of coated vesicles from the ER ( COPII coat ) , Golgi ( COPI coat ) , trans - Golgi network ( AP - 1 and AP - 3 clathrin coats ) , endosomes ( ESCRT complexes ) and plasma membranes ( AP - 2 clathrin coat ) , as well as in virus budding ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; Hurley and Hanson , 2010 ; Rossman and Lamb , 2013 ) . Members of the dynamin superfamily are the main drivers of membrane scission . They oligomerize at the neck of nascent vesicles and , upon hydrolysis of GTP , they trigger fusion between the two lipid bilayers , thereby causing the scission of the neck and detachment of the vesicle ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ) . High local concentrations of hydrophobic insertions at the neck of constricted vesicle carriers supports the fission of nascent membrane - trafficking vesicles by creating sufficient stress on the bilayer to favor scission , as it is the case for Sar1 at COPII vesicles ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) and epsin , which can support dynamin at clathrin - coated pits ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) . This mechanism is also likely to have a role in virus and exosome budding , as well as in the formation of multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) in endosomes , because key proteins involved in these processes have amphipathic helices ( Buchkovich et al . , 2013 ; Rossman et al . , 2010 ) . Membrane targeting and tethering Membrane curvature sensing has an important role in vesicle targeting , which is exerted through tethering proteins such as the Golgin GMAP - 210 that acts at the cis Golgi ( Drin et al . , 2007 ; Drin et al . , 2008 ) . This protein uses amphipathic helices at the tip of long molecular strings to sense high curvature on incoming vesicles before the engagement of soluble NSF attachment protein receptors ( SNAREs ) , thereby increasing the fidelity of vesicle targeting . Other examples are the highly curved membrane sensing by the autophagosome - specific adaptor barkor ( also known as Atg14L ) that mediates the subsequent recruitment of class III phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase during autophagosome biogenesis ( Fan et al . , 2011 ) , and the synergy between cargo recruitment by the autophagy receptor Atg19 and membrane bending of Atg8 - coated membranes during autophagophore wrapping around the cargo ( Sawa - Makarska et al . , 2014 ) . Membrane fusion The fusion between a vesicle and its target membrane is mediated by the assembly of cognate SNARE complexes that bring the two apposing membranes into close proximity upon assembly ( see poster ) ( Jahn and Scheller , 2006 ; Martens and McMahon , 2008 ) . However , SNARE complexes might be aided by both the lipid composition of the membrane and the coordinated action of membrane - bending modules , such as the C2 domains of synaptotagmin and Doc2 proteins , or the amphipathic helix of complexin , which facilitate and accelerate membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release at neuronal synapses ( Groffen et al . , 2010 ; Hui et al . , 2009 ; Martens et al . , 2007 ; Snead et al . , 2014 ) . Protein sorting The intrinsic shapes of transmembrane receptors might mediate their partitioning into regions of the membrane that accommodate the relevant shapes . This might be the case for nicotinic acetylcholine and glutamate receptors as well as Ca 2 + or K + channels that appear to concentrate at post - synaptic regions and other areas of high membrane curvature ( see poster ) ( Aimon et al . , 2014 ; Fertuck and Salpeter , 1974 ; MacKinnon , 2003 ; Unwin , 2005 ) . In making vesicle trafficking intermediates , the initial bud formation might help to concentrate proteins that favor the bud curvature or , alternatively , help to exclude proteins that either do not have an adaptor to localize them to the bud or have an intrinsic curvature that forces them to leave the bud . The concentration of high - curvature - sensing and - inducing proteins , such as Sar1 , the ESCRT complex or sorting nexin proteins , is also important for the organization of ER exit sites or endosomal sorting and recycling ( Cullen and Korswagen , 2012 ; Okamoto et al . , 2012 ) . Enzyme and protein activation Several enzymes display curvature - sensitive activities . For instance , the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin has a higher activity on highly curved membrane ( Chang - Ileto et al . , 2011 ) . The lipid - extraction capacity of the sterol transporter Osh4p ( also known as Kes1p ) is also greater at a high membrane curvature ( de Saint - Jean et al . , 2011 ; Drin et al . , 2007 ) , as is lipidation of the autophagy protein LC3 ( encoded by MAP1LC3A ) or GABARAP by Atg3 ( Nath et al . , 2014 ) . The small GTPases Arf , Arl and Sar1 , as well as some of their guanosine exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) are also activated by membrane curvature ( Bigay et al . , 2005 ; Krauss et al . , 2008 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . It is likely that future work will uncover many other instances of protein activation by membrane curvature . Conclusions and perspectives In addition to the lipid properties that are inherent to the membrane bilayer , several distinct mechanisms exist that allow proteins to sense , stabilize or generate a high local membrane curvature . Several of these mechanisms can be utilized in concert during complex membrane remodeling processes , such as organelle shaping and vesicle budding , scission and fusion . Consistent with its universality within eukaryotic cells , it is very likely that additional mechanisms underlying membrane shaping will be uncovered in the near future and that further cellular functions will be recognized to depend on membrane curvature .
