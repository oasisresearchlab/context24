Techniques for structuring work are essential to “being creative , ” but from the outside can often seem unstructured , counterproductive , or unrelated to creative output . Practitioners use these strategies to manage and structure their creative experience , shaping creative output as well as motivation and emotional af - fect . Creative strategies can be tool - and domain - agnostic , allowing learning and sharing techniques across practices and between tools . Practitioners experiment with their individual creative processes , deepening their understanding of their own personal process by ap - plying new strategies , or embracing different mindsets . Designers can support creative practitioners by incorporating understandings of such techniques and strategies into tools and systems to support these essential yet undersupported aspects of the creative process . Creativity support tools can help expert creative practitioners maintain sustainable daily practice and scaffold newcomers into life - long engagement by considering metacognition , emotional affect , task motivation , and working style . Such tools would go beyond skill - and task - oriented support , to address the overall experience of “being creative . ” We suggest that increased attention to the process - oriented aspects of sustained creative practice will improve the overall design of Creativity Support Tools ( CSTs ) . In service of 323 C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Nicholas et al . this goal , this paper presents a selection of techniques that expert practitioners use to structure their personal creative experience as both a description of existing practices and a foundation for CST designers to draw from when considering process - oriented CSTs . This work builds on studies which focus on supporting the per - sonal experience and emotional well - being of the artist as they engage in the creative process . For example , Treadaway [ 80 ] artic - ulated the importance of a tool supporting feelings of satisfaction , rather than focusing only on the tool’s effect on creative output . Re - cent work has explored the benefits of supporting process by devel - oping healthy relationships with failure [ 79 ] , supporting productive procrastination [ 9 ] , and enabling positive self - conception [ 25 , 44 ] during creative work . Each of these contributions focuses on the subjective experience of doing creative work , an important yet undersupported aspect of the creative process . Taking a process - oriented perspective , in this paper we iden - tify techniques used by experts across diverse fields that embody intra - personal aspects of creativity such as metacognitive skills , emotional support needs , working style , and intrinsic motivation . Far from being immutable personality characteristics , these can be shaped and enhanced intentionally , often through the use of specific tools . Understanding how experts currently manage and perceive their own creative strategies can inform the design of future tools that amplify the benefits of successful strategies and scaffold new techniques . Our work addresses the question : What characterizes creative strategies for creative professionals across domains ? Because the study of creativity necessarily spans disciplines [ 30 ] , it is crucial to work with experts across a wide range of domains , fields , and communities of practice as we seek to identify how ex - perts manage meta - cognitive and emotional needs . Looking at a diversity of creative processes provides both a lens onto broader commonalities of practice , as well as insights into specific details of unique creative processes , both of which can enrich approaches across domains . Frich et al . observed that current HCI research only sparsely draws from skillful creative practitioners’ tool - use and behaviours [ 29 ] ; by drawing on experiences in diverse disci - plines we expand existing bodies of knowledge about expert tool - use . Qualitative methods are uniquely appropriate for identifying and curating descriptions of creative strategies , which can pro - vide a source of long - lasting and technology - agnostic knowledge . This type of knowledge complements that gained from novel CSTs , which instantiate new ideas but are often ephemeral and hard to maintain [ 28 ] . Strong foundational understanding of creative pro - cesses can develop our perspective on how creativity works , and help construct new design directions . For example , Terry and My - natt described three creative strategies from a series of case studies of expert practitioners across diverse fields [ 76 ] ; these rich descrip - tions remain relevant to the design of creativity support tools ( CSTs ) even many years later . In this paper , we first situate our work within related litera - ture in creativity theory and CST design . Then , we introduce our methodology and analysis . Through analysis of our interviews , we identified strategies and techniques for overcoming ambigu - ity , staying inspired , and managing the creative process used by expert practitioners across diverse domains of performance , craft , engineering , science , art , and design . Each theme is grounded in descriptions of the behaviors of specific practitioners . We synthe - size our observations into four strategies : Strategic Forgetting , Mode Switching , Embodying Process , and Aestheticizing . Some of these are different from or even contrary to common design recommenda - tions , expanding our understanding of the range of creative process behaviors : for example , the strategy of Strategic Forgetting recom - mends against capturing output for future reference . Each strategy and technique is placed into our categorization of CSTs , to clarify relationships to prior work . We then ground these strategies in existing research about cognition , design practice , and creativity . Finally , we encourage a shift in CST research and design to focus on strategies that support creative process . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Creativity Research This work is part of ongoing efforts to connect creativity research more deeply with HCI [ 20 , 27 ] , as well as to leverage practitioner expertise in our understanding of tool - use and creativity [ 28 , 42 ] . We first establish a shared definition of creativity and a summary of current creativity research . The study of creativity spans disciplines , from neuroscience , cognitive science , psychology , and human com - puter interaction , to history , anthropology , and beyond , requiring a “synthesis of different disciplinary perspectives” [ 30 ] . As designers of CSTs , we draw on these myriad creativity theories to inform our approach . Rather than attempt a complete summary of all theories of creativity , here we discuss those most relevant to our work . While the definition of ‘creativity’ has evolved over time , the widely accepted [ 2 , 7 , 28 , 42 , 62 , 71 ] “standard definition” as ar - ticulated by Runco and Jaeger [ 65 ] requires both originality and effectiveness . Embracing this core definition , this paper addition - ally takes a social constructivist [ 81 ] perspective , which embraces a broad understanding of the ways in which people , environments , and tools combine to shape both process and outcome [ 18 , 19 , 37 , 48 , 62 , 75 , 81 ] . Plucker et al . [ 62 ] articulate such a vision of creativity research , focusing on the interaction between “aptitude , process , and environment” , a definition that is particularly relevant to HCI researchers . Fundamentally , we understand creative work as being done in a particular social and environmental context . An example of a particularly influential framing that takes into account both aptitude and process is Amabile’s Componential Model of creativity . Amabile emphasizes three core aspects of cre - ativity : domain - relevant skills , creativity - relevant processes , and task motivation ( especially intrinsic motivation ) [ 4 ] . Our paper fo - cuses on the latter two components , creativity - relevant processes , which include cognitive style , working style , and knowledge of heuristics , and task motivation [ 2 ] . While some of these ‘processes’ may be immutable personality characteristics , many ( e . g . , “toler - ance for ambiguity” and “suspending judgment” ) can be shaped by intentional tool use . Creativity researchers emphasize the value of focusing on dynamic , mutable aptitudes rather than on the study of static , immutable traits [ 2 , 22 , 32 , 62 ] . Recent work has emphasized the importance of understanding the creative experience in addition to creative outputs [ 32 ] . This represents an opportunity for CST research : tools that take into account the overall creative experience can facilitate growth and sustainable practice by mediating muta - ble intrapersonal aspects of creativity .

Research that identifies creative strategy provides insight into how creative practitioners work , such as how they generate ideas , gain new perspective , or reflect . Motivation management research focuses on how practitioners create and maintain motivation . The techniques described in this paper fall under creative strategy and motivation management , aspects of creative process . engage with and manage creativity - relevant processes provides a particularly rich foundation of knowledge for the CST community . Kaufman and Beghetto identify different levels of creative prac - tice [ 42 ] : our interviews focus on professionals , the " Pro - c " level , with significant experience and established success in their fields . Professional practice is a rich source for understanding creative behaviour [ 28 , 42 ] . We seek to contribute to deeper understandings of the way experts , operating at a high level of professional skill , manage and shape their own personal creative experiences , and how tools and systems could support that . 2 . 2 Process - Oriented Creativity Support Tools HCI research related to creative strategies often focuses on design - ing tools whose primary purpose is to facilitate high quality output by supporting specific tasks [ 5 , 9 , 36 , 43 , 49 – 51 , 78 ] ( Figure 2 ) . In contrast , our work focuses on identifying tool - agnostic creative strategies [ 9 , 25 , 28 , 41 , 52 , 58 , 76 ] , that can inform the designs and uses of many types of tools . For example , Frich et al . [ 28 ] identified two strategies in creative practitoners’ use of digital tools : ‘mar - gins’ , and ‘view - shifts’ . Both are tool - agnostic strategies used by expert practitioners as they iterate through a design process . We additionally focus on supporting mindsets that enable creativity . By supporting intrapersonal aspects of the creative process , we seek to improve and enrich day - to - day work and satisfaction ( Figure 2 ) . The relationship between affect and creativity is complex , with some evidence showing the positive impact of positive moods on creativity [ 3 , 40 , 61 ] and other findings that add nuance to this perspective [ 8 , 11 , 16 ] . Bartolic et al . found that brain activity asso - ciated with negative moods improves figural fluency compared with verbal fluency , while brain activity associated with positive moods had the opposite effect [ 8 ] . Sowden and Dawson similarly found that a negative mood helped participants assess the usefulness of a given evaluation , while a positive mood enhances performance on ideation tasks [ 70 ] . Bledow et al . described the impact of an affective shift on creativity , taking a dynamic view in which “the emergence of new ideas [ and positive affect ] is often preceded by and depends on a phase of negative affect” [ 11 ] . Creativity support tools can be designed to take emotional af - fect into account . For example , De Rooij et al . designed a system to enhance positive emotions which they argued would increase creativity [ 21 ] . Increasing positive emotions is not the only way to affect creativity , however : Torres et al . articulated strategies that expert practitioners use to manage experiences and feelings related to failure , including embracing failure , mitigation of the effects , and reframing failure entirely [ 79 ] . Belakova and Mackay reframed a ‘negative’ behaviour in their design of SonAmi : this tool addresses over - criticizing – a common barrier to creativity among writers – by providing creative distance from the authors’ own writing by replaying written snippets with a computer - generated voice [ 9 ] . The computer - generated voice enhanced the authors’ ability to both appreciate and constructively critique their own work . Kim et al . designed Mosaic to celebrate incremental process , a way of reframing the value of unfinished work . Mosaic displays works - in - progress as a way to both promote healthy communities 325 C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Nicholas et al . and positive self - conception [ 44 ] . Complementary to Kim et al . ’s findings , in this work we focus on how practitioners manage their individual creative process , rather than community interactions . Dow et al . ’s research on parallel prototyping [ 25 ] articulates not only a specific brainstorming strategy , but also the impact of such a strategy on a novice designer’s sense of self - efficacy , which has been shown to influence a variety of outcomes [ 6 ] , including one’s ability to learn [ 26 ] , find enjoyment in [ 17 ] and persist through [ 56 ] challenges , and engage in activities [ 6 ] . Directly influencing emotional affect is only one way to sup - port creativity . Other researchers have discovered ways to support creativity by making the creative process itself more visible and legible . Increased awareness of one’s own process can improve metacognitive understanding and learning outcomes [ 83 ] . Creating artifacts can be understood as a way to capture and view ‘fleeting moments’ of progress for visual artists [ 38 ] , or a way to maintain focus [ 54 ] . While these strategies do ultimately improve the final creative output , the immediate benefit is to improve the emotional well - being of the creator by engendering a sense of progress . Our work similarly seeks to scaffold healthy mindsets by designing sys - tems that take into account the emotional well - being of creative practitioners by reframing negative experiences , increasing positive affect , and supporting healthy awareness of process . Building on these earlier findings , we expand the conversation beyond students , designers , and engineers to include the rich practice across other domains , including performance , craft , science , and art . 3 METHODOLOGY 3 . 1 Interview Methods To understand practice “in the wild” we carried out semi - structured interviews with 12 expert creative practitioners and 3 early ca - reer practitioners . Interview questions were guided by grounding themes of artifact use and personal creative practice , and shaped by the individuals’ background and reflections . Each interview lasted 1 - 2 . 5 hours , during which we asked semi - structured interview ques - tions , focusing on personal creative practice and background . Most interviews took place in participants’ primary workspaces to under - stand their tool use in context [ 10 , 74 ] 1 . To ground our discussion in concrete examples of daily work , we followed principles of contex - tual inquiry [ 10 ] : topics centered on how each practitioner engages in their creative practice , how they use artifacts in their process , the tools and materials they use , and the techniques and strategies of their creative process . Participants were asked to walk us through concrete examples of their work - flows as a starting point for sur - facing details about their personal working style . Using a recent project of the participant as a grounding example , each participant was asked questions such as How do you make progress when you feel stuck ? How do you explore alternatives ? How do you assess your growth as an artist over time ? and What tools do you use during different stages of your process ? 1 In the case of five participants , video conferencing was used to remotely connect to thesubjectsattheirworkspacesduetotravellimitations , onebecauseoftheCOVID - 19 pandemic . One participant travels frequently , renting workspaces in different cities , so agreed to meet in a public space and share pictures from her rehearsal spaces . Our interviews are interactional events [ 75 ] , in which the ques - tions evolve in response to participant background , shaped by ear - lier interviews . We examined the use and creation of artifacts – rather than their functional properties – embracing Suchman’s idea that a tool can only be understood in relation to its social environ - ment and use [ 39 , 74 ] . Focusing on artifact use additionally allowed us to foreground custom - made tools , such as paper templates for weaving and violin making , or objects not typically understood as " creativity support tools , " such as a pile of handwritten notes , or an old project hung up on the wall . These artefacts could be under - stood as elements of an ‘Annotated Portfolio’ [ 12 , 31 ] , generated as part of a creative practitioner’s independent practice , helping to convey the decisions and the philosophy of each practitioner . We followed a cognitive ethnography approach [ 37 ] , focusing on how expert practitioners understand and reflect on their own practice . We are specifically interested in the reflective and meta - cognitive activities that creative individuals carry out , as well as their cognitive style [ 30 ] . Reflective self - report allowed us to in - vestigate the ways that people interpret and manage their own behaviors in their creative process , and what meaning they ascribe to their own actions [ 37 , 42 ] . As Glăveanu and Beghetto put it , “pro - cesses cannot be easily inferred from outcomes” [ 32 ] , so we asked practitioners to engage in reflection about their own techniques and strategies . 3 . 2 Practitioners Our informants represent domains that require novelty and open - ended problem solving , where practitioners must use creativity skills in daily work [ 42 ] . Many domains and practices are creative , even if they are not colloquially considered creative the way that art and performance are . We take a broad view of what domains are creative , as an area in which the practitioner utilizes creativ - ity . For example , software development is creative , as it requires open - ended problem solving and the creation of contextually novel solutions [ 53 ] . Recruitment began by selecting sites and intervie - wees according to an a priori set of distinctions that seemed most likely to be relevant ( e . g . collaborative vs independent work ) . We chose subsequent creative practices and experience levels to maxi - mize the range and diversity of experiences as our understanding evolved , in concert with our research questions . Following Char - maz’s Grounded Theory approach , we chose additional practices and experience levels within this frame that would support theory construction , rather than seeking population representativeness across “all” creative practices [ 15 ] . Each expert participant self - identified as an expert in their field , with a mean of 21 years of experience ( range 10 - 47 years ; Table 1 ) . Participants were asked to walk through concrete examples of their workflows as a starting point for surfacing details about their personal working styles . 3 . 3 Analysis Since the inception of Grounded Theory , it has split into three main branches : Strauss and Corbin ; Glaser ; and Charmaz [ 66 ] . We embrace Charmaz’s constructionist research style that under - stands knowledge as co - constructed between interviewee and re - searcher [ 14 , 15 ] . Our analysis is interpretivist , seeking to under - stand how our informants create meaning in their work [ 33 ] , and 326 Creative and Motivational Strategies Used by Expert Creative Practitioners C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Interview Participant ( Main Creative Domain ) Years of Experience Animal Behaviour Researcher 11 AR / VR Artist 19 Ceramicist 21 Director 47 Industrial Designer 23 Museum Curator 19 Physical Performer 22 Software Engineer 1 10 Software Engineer 2 12 Stylist 25 Tapestry Weaver 43 Violin Maker 18 Academic 9 Design Lead 6 Software Engineer 3 5 Table 1 : We interviewed 12 expert creative practitioners and 3 early career practitioners across diverse creative domains . is rooted in the social construction of knowledge and polysemic understandings of truth [ 46 ] . Our goals are to “provide a rich , contextualized understanding of human experience through the intensive study of particular cases” [ 63 ] , and to perform analysis that identifies the transfer - ability of findings [ 63 ] . We contrast quantitative understanding of generalizability , or statistical generalizability ( generalizing from subjects drawn at random from a representative sample ) , with both analytical generalizability ( generalizing to a construct or a theory ) , and transferability ( a collaboration between readers and authors , where authors provide rich , thick description and readers do work to apply the findings to other fields ) [ 13 , 46 , 63 ] . Following best practices for Charmaz’s branch of Grounded The - ory , we simultaneously engaged in analysis and data collection , iteratively constructing our analytic frame and updating our ques - tion prompts for future interviews as we identified and synthesized emerging themes [ 14 ] . For thematic analysis , we first transcribed each semi - structured interview , then performed open - coding [ 73 ] on the transcripts . We iteratively reviewed and analyzed all in - terview data and discussed all emerging themes [ 55 ] . Themes are presented below , addressing strategies practitioners use to structure their creative process to feed inspiration , break out of creative ruts , stay motivated , and tap into different aspects of the creative process when faced with ambiguity . 4 FINDINGS Throughout the interviews , we identified themes relating to the cre - ative process , creative cognition , motivation , and emotional affect ( discussed below in this paper ) . We additionally uncovered tensions around version control systems , and identified values embedded in CSTs which are at odds with some aspects of the creative pro - cess . For a full discussion centering these additional topics , please see [ 72 ] . Because each interview evolved organically , following discussion topics relevant to the creator at hand and our evolving analytic frame , we did not address each topic with each practitioner in depth . As such , we focus the below discussion on the creative and motivational techniques emphasized by eight of our informants . We identified four themes across our interviews as dominant strategies used by creative practitioners : Strategic Forgetting , Mode Switch - ing , Embodying Process , and Aestheticizing . We highlight each with a description and grounded observations . 4 . 1 Strategic Forgetting Inverting the common practice of capturing ideas at the moment of creation , we observed several practitioners purposefully leverage the natural forgetfulness of their mind as part of their creative process . We observed this technique of Strategic Forgetting in the Performance Director and Physical Performer . The Performance Director has been performing professionally for 47 years , and teach - ing performance for 30 ( Table 1 ) . He has performed as an acrobat , juggler , and clown , and worked as a teaching artist , producer , direc - tor , and playwright for both theatre and circus shows . His primary domain is physical performance ; recently he has expanded into writing and consulting . As a playwright , his process draws from his background as a performer , acting out scenes as he writes them . When developing material for a show , the Performance Director relies on his imperfect human memory as a filtering mechanism that results in only " memorable " work getting saved . Even while engaged in a writing process , the Performance Director first generates many ideas through physical improvisation – a familiar and comfortable practice for him . The nature of these improvisational sessions is fleeting ; yet rather than taking notes or recording the sessions , he purposefully prevents himself from capturing them : Performance Director : [ My mentor ] would say “Here’s the scene , try it , ” and then I would do it . . . he would not let me write it down in rehearsal . [ He would ] say “write the scene up tonight , ” on the theory that whatever I remembered was worth keeping from the scene . Which I found incredibly frustrating . But it works ! In other words , the Performance Director relies on the inherently ephemeral nature of his craft to allow himself to forget ideas . After some time has passed , he will finally write down notes on the rehearsal from earlier , capturing the ideas " worth " remembering . The Physical Performer engages in a similar process . The Physi - cal Performer has been working in performance for 22 years . She designs , directs , and performs one - woman physical comedy shows , drawing on her years of training in mime , acrobatics , and physi - cal comedy . Her primary creative domain is physical performance ; recently she has expanded into music and spoken comedy . Her cre - ative process involves improvisation , or “playing” : trying out new ideas and cycling back to old ideas . This improvisation is inherently physical , acting out the details of a scene to feel it in her body . She often deliberately avoids referencing her notes while improvising , and does not write a script : Physical Performer : I’d spend the week journaling , [ then ] I would flip through whatever I had written that week . . . And then I’d get on stage , put the notebook down , and I would just improvise for 10 - 15 minutes . . . Things that were not important didn’t get put in and things that were important got said . Like the Director , the Physical Performer found this to be a very successful method . She trusts her subconscious processing to foreground the parts of the story that were important to tell . She 327 C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Nicholas et al . Figure 3 : The Performance Director keeps and displays many artifacts from his career , including notebooks with extensive rehearsal content . He is dedicated to building a collection of artifacts to track and manage his creative process . Despite his dedication to capturing , his creative practice also involves Strategic Forgetting ( described in Section 4 . 1 ) . These images repre - sent selected artifacts from his creative space , the tangible history of what has not been “strategically forgotten” . From left to right : 1 . , 2 . The Performance Director’s working space , filled with props , costumes , set pieces , and memorabilia from his long career as a working artist . 3 . A notebook containing notes on acrobatic tricks . 4 . Hand - drawn stick figures showing acrobatic tricks , from the notebook . 5 . A cut - out from a magazine , used to recall technique . specifically structures her working style to enable her subconscious mind to play an active role in the creative process . Through this process , the Physical Performer maintains freedom , flexibility , and liveness in her individual process and her collabo - rations by deliberately omitting certain information . For example , the Physical Performer would audio record instead of video record her performances , because she didn’t want to constrain herself by repeating the gestures she had done in that earlier performance . This practice supports her own expectations and values of what a performance should be , and how it should feel from her perspective : Physical Performer : I need to keep something unscripted , oth - erwise I feel like it dies . The two performers found value in purposefully embracing the ephemerality of their medium in the generative phases of their work . Strategic Forgetting supports liveness and curation of ideas . 4 . 2 Mode Switching In Actor - Network Theory , Latour articulates what happens when a person ( actor ) works with a tool : a new actor entity comes into existence that represents the unique combination of them both [ 47 , 48 ] . Creative practitioners similarly change which tool is in use in a conscious effort to bring a new , combined , person - tool entity into existence . We see Software Engineer 3 and the Physical Performer both leveraging this relationship with tools to enter and support particular modes of creative behavior by deliberately changing tools . Software Engineer 3 has been working professionally as an en - gineer for 5 years . He works in the Research and Development arm of a wireless technology company . He has a habit of printing out new code he’s learning , taping the pages together , and adding hand - written annotations to track his thinking . He keeps three different whiteboards in his office , one on his desk for quick notes , one on his wall for brainstorming , and one behind his computer for longer - term reference . The affordances of the different whiteboards initiate certain creative modes : Software Engineer 3 : I like the size of [ the wall whiteboard ] : it’s a nice big whiteboard , you can draw big things . It’s also easier to reference – to look at [ up on the wall ] . Because sometimes I’ll sit here , [ puts legs up on desk ] , and I’m just staring at my whiteboard , like “what am I going to do with this . . . ” It’s harder to do that with a small , 8x11 piece of paper . The large whiteboard prompted a creative mode that supported engagement with “big ideas” . Participants such as Software Engi - neer 3 are attuned to the ways in which different tools shape and define their creative process , and they consciously select a tool to shift into a particular creative mode . This behavior is distinct from choosing a tool in order to generate a specific output ; instead , the tool is chosen to shape the practitioner’s behavior or mindset , driven by changing creative , cognitive , and emotional needs . The Performer also described consciously leveraging different tools to generate a particular mode of engagement with her work . For example , when she creates a new show , she sometimes im - provises in front of a video - camera . The video - camera acts as a pseudo - audience , allowing her to access her performing mindset “without a lot of pressure , and with a lot of freedom and a lot of joy . ” Next , she re - watches these recordings , and writes down her favorite parts . Switching to writing is a deliberate choice ; writing is a more difficult medium for her , which has “different vibes” from videotaping . Switching mediums allows her to switch mindsets , from “the improv , physical , playful channel” to the “gleaner of info channel” . This switch is driven by her physical and emotional needs , rather than a need for a particular type of recording : Physical Performer : There’s a time when it’s right for me to get up and move and then there’s a time when that window closes and it’s a time to reflect and it doesn’t feel right to get up and move – it would be forceful to do that . It’s almost like a switch : different channels are open . There’s a point where it’s " off " . The door on that [ mode ] is closed . Writing in a journal was a relatively new introduction to the Physical Performer’s creative process . Her previous techniques involved meditating on mental images , and sketching high - level ‘texture maps’ of her shows . She discovered journal writing in a class designed to help performers create a new show . The instruc - tions from the course involved writing a script that would later be performed , but instead she found it more beneficial to integrate 328 Creative and Motivational Strategies Used by Expert Creative Practitioners C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Figure 4 : The Physical Performer finds benefits in con - sciously leveraging different capabilities of tools in her prac - tice to manage and respond to her evolving creative needs ( Mode Switching , described in Section 4 . 2 ) . Left : Components of a show , physically rearrangeable on notecards . Right : A rehearsal room the performer used while on tour . this new journaling technique with her “home domain” of improvi - sation , and uses each medium at different parts of the process . Physical Performer : Many times I’ve videotaped 15 - 25 minutes [ of improv ] and that’s like 3 minutes of something I like . So the writing would be grabbing the 3 minutes . And then the next video I would look at [ the writing ] and start with that , or I’d just put that to the side and [ see ] what wants to come through today . And then take the 2 minutes from that one , and then put the 2 minutes and 3 minutes together . And then do another video session that’s 1 minute . . . . It feels like a distilling process . One modality to the other modality would distill it . Here , the Physical Performer is deliberately leveraging differ - ent forms of reflective conversations by using different tools and mediums through the strategy of mode switching . 4 . 3 Embodying Process Completing a task and feeling that you’ve completed a task are sometimes two separate experiences . Especially for knowledge workers , whose output can seem ephemeral , having tangible , phys - ical , visible , embodied proof of intermediate effort provides mo - tivational benefits , both as concrete reminders of progress and completed work , and as tools to understand and reflect on personal process . For example , the Animal Behavior Researcher takes care to de - sign her tools around visible access to progress . The Animal Behav - ior Researcher has been working in the field of animal behavior for 11 years . She is as a post - doctoral researcher at a university in the United States and runs her own business helping clients with cat behavioral issues . As a scientist , she collects and generates many different forms of data , nearly all of which she has saved for the past several years , despite having no pragmatic need for the raw data . Instead , these notebooks , datasheets , annotated images , and other forms of information about her work support her emotional well - being : for example , the Animal Behavior Researcher has saved a notebook full of technical details from a complicated process she never plans to repeat . The process itself represents a particular scientific method that she associates with ‘real science’ , so the note - book acts as a physical reminder of that experience and validation of her own competence : Animal Behavior Researcher : : [ It is ] proof that I actually did it . She also keeps copies of datasheets , maps , and notes from a complicated and time - consuming research project as large stacks of paper in a cabinet in her house . Even though all the research with that data was already published , and there is no practical reason to keep physical records , the primary benefit for her is emotional : she finds emotional value in keeping the original physical pages as a reminder of her achievements . The Animal Behavior Researcher also maintains a notebook for tracking various todo lists , meeting notes , and ideas . While prag - matically useful as a way to track her work , the act of writing down tasks prompts reflection , and provides her with useful visibility into her process : Animal Behavior Researcher : When I find myself writing the same task over and over it usually represents some kind of in - ternal struggle . The Animal Behavior Researcher deliberately constructs an envi - ronment that supports personal feelings of success , and provides vis - ibility into her own process by capturing both process and progress in a physical lab notebook . Foregrounding and physicalizing artifacts can also reframe fail - ures and mistakes as essential stages of the creative process , which supports continued engagement with challenging tasks and a pro - ductive learning mindset . Keeping even unsuccessful artifacts avail - able and visible can provide concrete benefit to future projects , and buffer against negative feelings of waste or lack of progress . The Tapestry Weaver has been working on her craft for 43 years . Over her career as a weaver she has created everything from yardage for clothing to artistic pieces meant for display in exhibits . Her workspace ( Figure 5 ) has boxes of old weavings , raw materials , notebooks , and works - in - progress tucked under every ta - ble and filling multiple bookshelves , and old artworks on the walls . The artworks she chooses to display are often ones she considers ‘incomplete’ , or ‘unsuccessful’ . Instead of discarding or hiding a failure , she hangs it up so that she can continue thinking about how to re - appropriate or improve it . The purpose of a tapestry does not end when it is completed , but rather feeds back into the creative process : Weaver : And so I keep on thinking , well , this one wasn’t so successful but I can play with it . And start reworking it . The Weaver conceptualized even completed artwork as potential “grist” for her creative mill , especially if she was dissatisfied with the final output . Compare the Animal Behavior Researcher’s sense of accomplish - ment triggered by her old notebook , or feelings of potential created by the visibility of the Weaver’s unsuccessful work , with Software Engineer 3’s feelings of despair when his process of brainstorming on a whiteboard generates no artifacts : Software Engineer 3 : What doesn’t feel productive is indecision . Sometimes I’ll spend the day like “should I make this design decision or should I make that design decision , I don’t like this , ” and I always feel like I’m just going back and forth and not really making much progress . Just sitting there staring at my whiteboard like “should I do it this way or should I do it that way . ” I feel like I can waste a lot of time without any decision . 329 C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Nicholas et al . Figure 5 : The weaver saves and displays ‘unsuccessful’ projects on her wall ( second image ) to reframe them as part of her process ( Embodying Process , Section 4 . 3 ) . Here we share additional images from the Weaver’s practice . From left to right : 1 . The weaver’s in - home weaving studio , featuring a large loom , and materials in open cabinets . 2 . Framed tapestries - her own work . More shelves and raw weaving materials .

Tagboard holding space in a weaving to create a curved shape . 4 . The completed weaving with the warp pulled taut after removing the tagboard . The whiteboard used by Software Engineer 3 – easily erased , leaving no ‘artifacts’ of a brainstorming session whether successful or not – does not provide the benefit of embodied progress . 4 . 4 Aestheticizing Brainstorming literature shows that encouraging quantity ( over quality ) produce both higher quantity and higher quality ideas in the end [ 23 , 59 , 60 , 64 ] . In the context of brainstorming there is no trade - off between quality and quantity : by focusing on quantity , you get quality too . But for prototypes , which involve more time and effort to construct , this trade - off is an important concern . Design practitioners often sacrifice aesthetic refinement in favor of quickly generating many low - fidelity prototypes , which while individu - ally less accurate or refined , lead to better end results [ 25 , 57 , 82 ] . However the aesthetics of an artifact do not only affect the output : deliberate choices around aesthetics are key factors in intrinsic motivation and overall creative experience . Motivation is an es - sential component of the process of creative work , with intrinsic motivation supporting creativity , and extrinsic motivation often suppressing it [ 2 ] . Among some of our participants , aesthetic re - finement in their work was a source of intrinsic motivation . Attention to beauty suffused all aspects of the AR / VR Artist’s workflow , not just in his artistic outputs but also in even basic documentation . The AR / VR Artist is an expert in creating digital art in augmented and virtual reality . His creative process involves building reusable digital assets and creating documentation that he or others can use in the future to learn skills and process . The AR / VR Artist invests considerable time and effort into saving in - formation , resources , and research if he feels that they might be useful for himself or others later . Yet even if a document will never be shared publicly , he takes time to make the visuals feel " finished " . For example , as he collected examples for how to write campaign emails , he structured them into a beautiful slide deck because it satisfied his own sense of progress : AR / VR Artist : I like to at some point take my ideas from a notepad document to . . . something that is a little bit more nice to look at . . . . It helps me visualize it as being more done , or presentable . While he begins with less aesthetically refined collections of screenshots and notes , the act of creating a beautiful presentation helps him distill his thoughts . After creation , the aesthetic artifact is one he desires to return to and continue working with , which keeps his task motivation high . He emphasized how much this process benefited not only others , but upheld his own satisfaction with his work : AR / VR Artist : It helps me feel like it’s officially out there . . . it motivates me , more , than – if it were just in a notebook , I might feel like I were just scrawling out ideas . The AR / VR Artist is highly intrinsically motivated by creating vi - sually appealing content , and by designing for an audience , whether that audience is real or imagined ( he described creating a 60 - page document in InDesign that “no one asked for” ) . The Industrial Designer similarly described being motivated to make even quick sketching appealing to the eye . The Industrial Designer has been working in design for 23 years , on a wide variety of products , including toys , cars , medical devices and hand - held electronics , as well as experiences such as museums and restaurants . His process is highly physical and visual ; a notebook or a piece of cardboard is always at hand , ready to be drawn on or reshaped . The impulse to externalize is almost reflexive at this point in his career ; a conversation about ideas inevitably will become a sketching session , or example materials will come out to be handled , considered , and recombined . For him , the main purpose of sketching is to " inspire thinking " , sketching itself is " exploration on the page " . Yet he values making beautiful sketches , regardless of whether they are to be kept long term or used only briefly , shown to others or only himself . Creating sketches with a polished aesthetic both improves his ability to communicate ideas and gives him personal satisfaction in his work . He described wanting his drawings to be " happy to look at " , and takes pains to ensure that even the quickest of sketches have this quality ( see Figure 6 for examples of ‘happy sketches’ ) . While the AR / VR Artist and the Industrial Designer both increase intrinsic motivation through highly aesthetic artifacts , some par - ticipants felt an opposite effect . The Academic , early in his career , found freedom and motivation in " lowering the bar " of quality , both for aesthetics and content . The Academic is an advanced graduate 330 Creative and Motivational Strategies Used by Expert Creative Practitioners C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Figure 6 : ‘Happy sketches’ created by the Industrial De - signer . Sketches with a polished aesthetic improve his abil - ity to communicate ideas with others and give him personal satisfaction in his work ( Aestheticizing , Section 4 . 4 ) . student at a university in the United States . He specializes in study - ing how humans understand systems from an interdisciplinary lens and cares deeply about the craft of research . The Academic specifically described being " scared " by his " proper art notebook " : Academic : Because I want every piece of art that goes in there to be beautiful . . . so whenever I go to draw in it , I’m like : " Once I draw in here , that page is in here forever , I can’t remove it . " For him , the permanence and high quality of the art notebook was intimidating , stymieing creation . In this case , the art notebook placed external expectations of aesthetic refinement on his work , decreasing motivation . Instead , he prefers to hand - bind his own notebooks , using the cheapest possible printer paper . Academic : If I put a real clunker of a poem in [ the handbound notebook ] , it’s like , eh , who cares , I’m probably not even going to come back and read these , no one is going to read them , it’s ok . It gives me more latitude to just try something . By deliberately de - emphasizing aesthetics , the Academic in - creases his motivation . While their approaches to aesthetics differed , the AR / VR Artist , Industrial Designer , and Academic all found de - liberate choices around aesthetics to be key factors in intrinsic motivation and overall creative process . 5 DISCUSSION Here we situate our findings in current creativity support research , and identify future directions . While our findings primarily repre - sent strategies used by expert creative practitioners , we speculate on ways in which these techniques may apply across domains , or be used to scaffold newcomers into sustainable creative practice . 5 . 1 The value of forgetting Recent thinking in psychology has resulted in a major reframing of memory " failures " , uncovering the ways in which errors can be ben - eficial to mental processes , including evidence that memory failures can facilitate novel thinking [ 24 ] . These recent findings have not yet been incorporated into the design of creativity support tools , but offer a structured way to consider how tools might leverage creative strategies like Strategic Forgetting . For example , memory errors that involve incomplete encoding , which the Director and Performer embrace , can be categorized as one of three types of ‘omission’ error [ 24 ] , two of which are relevant here : transience and absentmindedness . Transient memories , or those that gradually fade over time , may help break creative " fixation " by letting irrelevant information fade , resulting in more focus on the problem at hand . Deliberately not capturing ideas may allow the subconscious mind to distill out the valuable content , only retaining the ideas that resonate . Absentmindedness describes the tendency of the mind to drift to new topics , which may result in creative combinations of seemingly unrelated information . Not writing down notes about an idea may increase the chances of encountering new ideas together with the topic at top of mind . Because the mind automatically has a tendency to drift to new topics , Strategic Forgetting may increase opportunities for new and creative connections . This technique is related to , but distinct from , a well - known strategy of incubation , framed by early discus - sions of mathematical creativity : " incubation generally precedes illumination . In this period of incubation , no work of the mind is consciously perceived " [ 34 ] . Incubation continues to be impor - tant to conceptions of creativity ; Shneiderman refers to those who embrace incubation and illumination as " Inspirationalists " [ 68 , 69 ] . Strategic Forgetting is a more extreme strategy : rather than only taking time away from a project to allow the mind to incubate and free - associate , Strategic Forgetting prevents the capture of any information during the generative phase or prior to incubation . Identifying potential benefits of such a strategy is an area ripe for future exploration . CSTs could be designed to support hiding or ob - fuscation of data ( e . g . , by sub - sampling images , dithering , dropping frames , applying filters , etc ) . While this strategy has recently begun to be explored within the field of creativity research , few designers 2 have attempted to incorporate this technique into a CST . Might a programmer think differently about the range of solution options if they prohibit themselves from writing down the details of an early solution draft ? Would the architecture of an application simplify if an engineer had to remember it instead of writing it down ? If we design digital tools that selectively blur notes and sketches to aid in " forgetting " , should this forgetting be stochastic or predictable ? Which details 2 One example is “another day” , a tool that allows the capture of only 4 days’ worth of writing at a time : https : / / github . com / thmsbfft / another - day 331 C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Nicholas et al . Theme Recommendations Strategic Forgetting Design tools to flexibly support capture and omission , including no capture at all . A system that captures early brainstorming could also explicitly allow ‘hiding’ of early iterations to let the creative mind process . Mode Switching Support different creative modes through distinctive interfaces that take advantage of different mediums and modalities . Simplify transitions in and out of an application to help creators make a personalized ‘pipeline’ that works for their own process . Embodying Process Design progress - tracking systems to account for both practical and motivational needs . Provide visibility into process for personal reflection . Aestheticizing Provide tools that help creators become aware of and focus on the aesthetics of their creations . Highlight synergistic extrinsic and intrinsic motivations . Table 2 : Summary of our study findings and design recommendations for process - focused creativity support tools . should be hidden , and when ( if ever ) should they reappear ? At what point in a practitioner’s development is it helpful to introduce these techniques - would a novice benefit from them as much as an established expert ? Strategic forgetting may provide benefits through not creating artifacts at all . However , some practitioners must create artifacts in order to think - through - doing , such as a writer who develops their thoughts by drafting . To gain some of the benefits of strategic forgetting , a system could support the behavior of destroying that first draft . These represent themes that are currently underexplored in the world of software in particular , and creativity support tools in general . 5 . 2 Constructing creative modes via tool use The Physical Performer’s description of her relationship with her process , environment and tools closely parallels Dalsgaard’s notion of instruments of inquiry , an understanding of the way the creative process " intertwines " and " co - evolves with " the environment and tools . This Deweyan pragmatist perspective , which underlies Dals - gaard’s philosophy , elucidates the way the Performer leverages tools to augment her own cognition and creative process [ 18 ] . Forexample , wecanframeheruseofMode Switchingas‘knowing - through - action’ : combining her expertise as a professional per - former with the tools of video - recording and writing together pro - duces output – in this case , a scene – that is meaningful and that moves her design process forward . This ‘knowing - through - action’ arises as she leverages different tools throughout her process . She explicitly describes the different ‘modes of work’ she taps into by using the video - camera , or the journal , and how these tools then shape the mindset she has and the way she interacts with her own output . Distributed cognition [ 37 ] presents a similar lens for under - standing this concept , which also embraces the larger context of her working environment as part of her cognition . In other words , her creative process is an emergent property of the interaction between her own skills and the camera or the journal . A similar method , reported by Frich et al . [ 28 ] , is the ‘view - shift’ strategy , described as : “deliberately shifting the perspective or view of the workspace in order to move between a view of the whole composition and a component that is part of it . ” View - shifting is primarily about switching between two perspectives to gain additional perspective on a particular sub - part of a project . In contrast , Mode Switching is about deliberately using different tools to manage creative , cognitive , and emotional needs across a project’s lifetime . However , both represent emergent properties of the interaction between the practitioner and their tools . Seen through the lens of instruments of inquiry [ 19 ] or distributed cognition [ 37 ] , we can see the importance of understanding how closely enmeshed the creative behavior is with the tools at hand . In the example described above , switching modalities ( from video - taping to writing ) was nearly synonymous with switching creative modes ( from generating to editing ) . It is difficult to separate the thinking and doing aspects of her working style , and difficult to separate the goal of the task from the tools used in that task . In what ways can tools support this process ? Is the switch from paper - based to a video - based medium important ? Our findings resonate with earlier work on tangible tools that tap into muscle memory and tacit , embodied forms of knowledge [ 45 ] . Finding ways to switch modes by switching tools can help practitioners transition across different stages of their creative process . Our work further motivates the design of tools that span modalities and mediums , or that have distinctive digital interfaces . More extreme switching of mediums may help more extreme switching of creative modes . Additionally , tools that make it easy to transition in and out of an application can help creators make a personalized ‘pipeline’ to support stages of a personal creative process . 5 . 3 Benefits of metacognitive awareness To improve a process , it is important to first understand what the existing process is . Examining the steps involved in generating artifacts can bring awareness to the creative processes in place . Even during our interviews , our participants found that discussing , analyzing , and coming to a deeper understanding of their own pro - cesses was interesting , helpful , and at some points almost cathartic . In addition to revealing process , artifacts can themselves provide metacognitive benefits . Some of our creative practitioners deliber - ately leveraged artifacts generated through their creative process as tangible reminders of a hard day’s work . Supporting emotional well - being by embodying , foregrounding and visualizing progress is key to maintaining a long and sustainable creative practice . Hazzard et al . generated a ‘taxonomy of failure’ in the context of musical performance [ 35 ] highlighting another perspective on ‘failure’ in the context of artistic practice . Abtahi et al . recently explored ways in which people engage in manual self - tracking practices , finding similar benefits of creating personal , tangible traces [ 1 ] . Would a software engineer feel more positively about the productivity 332 Creative and Motivational Strategies Used by Expert Creative Practitioners C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy of design sessions if that process generated a visible or tangible indication of activity ? How can a system foreground these types of otherwise - ephemeral efforts in a way that supports creative work ? 5 . 4 The role of aesthetics in task motivation Some of our expert participants have found that embracing aes - thetic refinement keeps them engaged in their creative practice . This engagement relates to the nature of motivation , intrinsic and extrinsic : the AR / VR Artist’s and Industrial Designer’s approaches are “synergistic extrinsic motivators” , part of the task motivation component of Amabile’s Componential Model of creativity [ 2 ] . Synergistic extrinsic motivators both 1 ) support a “sense of compe - tence” and 2 ) enable a deeper involvement with the task , without undermining their sense of self - determination ( a known problem with extrinsic motivators such as gamification ) . For these creative practitioners , aesthetics is such a synergistic motivator . Aesthetic satisfaction also has echoes of the values of craftsmanship : “an en - during , basic human impulse , the desire to do a job well for its own sake” [ 67 ] . Craftsmanship fosters a sense of pride and satisfaction in one’s work , and ownership over process ; for these creators , valuing aesthetics contributes to their sense of a job well done . Aesthetic enjoyment might also increase the length of time someone spends engaging with their creations , or make the creations themselves more memorable . For some creators the pressure to create something beautiful can disrupt their creative process and cause writer’s block . We note with interest that the early career Academic reported this , while the experts did not . For our expert informants , the joy they got from cre - ating high quality artifacts kept them engaged in the process , and motivated them to continue creating . Our view is that nearly any behavior that keeps a creative practitioner joyfully engaged with their practice is valuable , as long as it does not become a fixation that prevents forward motion . Even if " best practices " recommend low fidelity creations , experts often find value in taking the time to enhance aesthetics when it works for them . Low - fidelity is of - ten conflated with low - aesthetics , but even low - fi prototypes can maintain a level of craftsmanship and care . The Industrial Designer describes the extensive effort he put in to avoiding ragged edges when cutting foamcore , investing significant effort into creating clean cuts even during lo - fi prototyping . There is a certain level of craftsmanship that can be embraced even when other details are excluded . Because aesthetic taste is so personal , and tools cannot be designed to satisfy everyone , tools might instead help practitioners identify and reflect on their aesthetic preferences , and how these might be influencing their creative process . 6 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper , we have engaged with a broad array of creative prac - tices . We have identified tool - and domain - agnostic strategies that have great potential to provide insights that are relevant across domains , mediums , and approaches . Our primary interest is in what Kvale might describe as the “what could be” target of generaliza - tion [ 46 ] ; seeking insight from the true experiences of individuals . We have found that learning about others’ successful creative strate - gies is often beneficial ; though creative process is highly personal , heuristics and work styles can be learned , shared , and adapted be - tween individuals [ 2 ] . Indeed , people often informally share their creative strategies in online settings as part of their creative process . Foregrounding creative strategies may help individual practi - tioners experiment with their own process by applying new heuris - tics . Designers of creativity support tools can engage with process - focused aspects of creativity , incorporating support for heuristics to assist users in developing satisfying , lifelong practice . In the future , we hope to present these strategies and techniques to practitioners across disciplines . For instance , what would the AR / VR Artist or the Weaver think about the concept of ‘strategic forgetting’ ? How might the Animal Behavior Researcher incorporate ‘Aestheticizing’ into her process ? In addition to expanding our understanding of these practices , this could help identify the extent to which such techniques are actually ‘practice - agnostic’ . Our methodology engages primarily with techniques that a prac - titioner is consciously aware of and can actively reflect on . Comple - mentary methodologies may surface techniques that practitioners are not aware of or are hesitant to share with an interviewer . In future work , observations and formal contextual inquiry , paired with further interviews and microgenetic techniques are a par - ticularly promising area for generating deeper understanding of unconscious behaviors [ 42 , 77 ] . We also note that the two practi - tioners who shared feelings of dissatisfaction with their process ( the Academic and the Software Engineer 3 ) are both early career practitioners . Further work may explore how creative satisfaction evolves over time . An additional area of interest is how and when to scaffold newcomers into behaviours that experts identify as sup - porting successful , sustainable careers . The strategies reported here are a selection of examples ; many more creativity heuristics exist , and could be identified and shared through further research with other practitioners and domains . 7 CONCLUSION In this paper we have described strategies and techniques that di - verse creative practitioners leverage throughout their practice to manage their cognitive state , working style , motivation , and cre - ative output . We identified four strategies from semi - structured in - terviews : Strategic Forgetting , Mode Switching , Embodying Process , and Aestheticizing . We then connected these to existing creativity research literature , and synthesized our findings into recommen - dations that we hope will inform the future design of Creativity Support Tools that increase generation of creative work in a way that also enhances creativity itself .
