This endows EVs with immense potential for drug delivery and regenerative medicine applications . Understanding the biology underlying EV - based intercellular transfer of cargo is of great importance for the development of EV - based therapeutics . Here , we sought to characterize the cellular mechanisms involved in EV uptake . Internalization of ﬂ uorescently - labeled EVs was evaluated in HeLa cells , in 2D ( monolayer ) cell culture as well as 3D spheroids . Uptake was assessed using ﬂ ow cytometry and confocal microscopy , using chemical as well as RNA interference - based inhibition of key proteins involved in individual endocytic pathways . Experiments with chemical inhibitors revealed that EV uptake depends on cholesterol and tyrosine kinase activity , which are implicated in clathrin - independent endocytosis , and on Na + / H + exchange and phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ac - tivity , which are important for macropinocytosis . Furthermore , EV internalization was inhibited by siRNA - mediated knockdown of caveolin - 1 , ﬂ otillin - 1 , RhoA , Rac1 and PAK1 , but not clathrin heavy chain . Together , these results suggest that EVs enter cells predominantly via clathrin - independent endocytosis and macro - pinocytosis . Identi ﬁ cation of EV components that promote their uptake via pathways that lead to functional cargo transfer might allow development of more e ﬃ cient therapeutics through EV - inspired engineering . 1 . Introduction Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are cell - derived membranous nano - particles that enclose and transport complex molecules , including pro - teins , nucleic acids , lipids and sugars , derived from the parent cell [ 1 ] . EVs have been found to function as natural carrier systems that e ﬃ - ciently deliver their molecular cargo to recipient cells . EVs are released by organisms ranging from prokaryotic cells to higher eukaryotes , and in mammals these vesicles have been reported to be released from al - most all cell types . EVs are generally classi ﬁ ed into three subtypes , apoptotic bodies , microvesicles and exosomes , according to their in - tracellular origin [ 2 ] . However , no uniform EV nomenclature exists as of yet , due to overlap in vesicle sizes and an absence of subtype - speci ﬁ c markers [ 3 ] . Therefore , vesicle subtypes are collectively referred to as EVs . EVs have recently been demonstrated to act as a cell - to - cell com - munication system involved in the natural transfer of macromolecules between producer and recipient cells . As such , EVs can a ﬀ ect recipient cell behavior , and modify physiological as well as pathological processes [ 4 ] . For this reason , the potential usage of EVs for therapeutic applications , including cell - free approaches for tissue engineering and drug delivery , is increasingly being explored [ 5 – 7 ] . Very encouraging proof - of - concept studies suggest that EVs may bear intrinsic properties for anti - tumor immunotherapy [ 8 ] , for treatment of immunological disorders ( e . g . graft - versus - host disease [ 9 ] ) or for protecting or re - generating tissue after e . g . kidney injury [ 10 ] or myocardial infarction [ 11 ] . Furthermore , EVs may be modi ﬁ ed for targeted drug delivery , which has already been successfully demonstrated in small animal studies for therapeutic delivery of RNA [ 12 ] , protein [ 13 ] , and small molecules [ 14 ] . As EVs seem naturally capable of crossing biological barriers leading to functional delivery of their cargo , it may be hypothesized that they utilize native mechanisms for internalization and intracellular traf - ﬁ cking [ 15 ] . Endocytosis has been reported to be the major route through which EVs are engulfed by cells [ 16 – 19 ] . However , detailed mechanisms remain unknown . For successful utilization of EVs as therapeutic carrier systems , understanding the cellular entry routes that these endogenous carriers follow to deliver their cargo into recipient http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . jconrel . 2017 . 09 . 019 Received 24 July 2017 ; Received in revised form 12 September 2017 ; Accepted 13 September 2017 ⁎ Corresponding author at : Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and Haematology , University Medical Center Utrecht , Heidelberglaan 100 , 3584 CX , Utrecht , The Netherlands . 1 Authors contributed equally E - mail address : pvader @ umcutrecht . nl ( P .

This is an open access article under the CC BY - NC - ND license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / BY - NC - ND / 4 . 0 / ) . T cells is of critical importance . There are numerous mechanisms through which cells may inter - nalize endocytic cargo . Generally , endocytosis is divided into two main subgroups : phagocytosis and pinocytosis . Phagocytosis is a type of en - docytosis that involves internalization of relatively large ( > 1 μ m ) particles and is typically restricted to specialized professional phago - cytes . Pinocytosis , in contrast , is exhibited by all cells , and is commonly classi ﬁ ed into clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( CDE ) , clathrin - in - dependent endocytosis ( CIE ) and macropinocytosis ( MP ) . CIE can be further categorized into caveolae - , Arf - 6 , ﬂ otillin - 1 - , CDC42 - and RhoA - dependent endocytosis [ 20 , 21 ] . The ability of nanoparticles to deliver their cargo and elicit a bio - logical response is strongly determined by the mechanism through which they are taken up [ 22 – 24 ] . Here , we set out to identify the en - docytic routes involved in internalization of EVs . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cell culture A431 ( human epidermoid carcinoma ) cells ( ATCC ) and HeLa ( human cervical carcinoma ) cells ( ATCC ) were cultured in Dulbecco ' s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 100 U / mL penicillin and 100 U / mL streptomycin . Cells were cultivated at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 under humidi ﬁ ed conditions . Cells were routinely checked for Mycoplasma contamination . 2 . 2 . EV isolation A431 cells were seeded in T175 ﬂ asks and cultured for 24 h , after which medium was replaced by serum - free Opti - MEM ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) supplemented with 100 U / mL penicillin , 100 U / mL strepto - mycin . After 48 h , EVs were isolated using a recently described size - exclusion chromatography method [ 25 ] . Conditioned medium ( CM ) was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C . Subsequently , CM was vacuum ﬁ ltered using 0 . 45 μ m bottle top ﬁ lters ( Thermo Fisher Scien - ti ﬁ c ) and concentrated to ≤ 5 mL using 100 kD MWCO Amicon Ultra - 15 Centrifugal Filter Units ( Millipore ) at 4 °C . Concentrated CM was loaded onto a HiPrep 16 / 60 Sephacryl S - 400 HR gel ﬁ ltration column ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) , equilibrated with phosphate - bu ﬀ ered saline ( PBS ) and connected to an ÄKTA Start chromatography system ( GE Healthcare ) , both maintained at 4 °C . EVs were separated from non - vesicular material using PBS as eluent . EV - containing fractions ( as determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm ) were pooled , ﬁ ltered through a 0 . 45 μ m ﬁ lter and concentrated using 100 kD MWCO Amicon Ultra - 15 Centrifugal Filter Units at 4 °C . 2 . 3 . Western blot analysis Cells or EVs were lysed in RIPA bu ﬀ er ( Alfa Aesar ) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Lysates were cen - trifuged at 12000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material , after which protein concentrations were determined using a MicroBCA Protein Assay using bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as a standard ac - cording to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Lysates were mixed with sample bu ﬀ er containing dithiothreitol ( or without for CD63 analysis ) , heated to 95 °C for 10 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 4 – 12 % Bis - Tris polyacrylamide gels ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) . Proteins were blotted on Immobilon - FL polyvinylidene di ﬂ uoride membranes ( Millipore ) , after which membranes were blocked with 50 % v / v Odyssey Blocking Bu ﬀ er ( LI - COR Biosciences ) in Tris - bu ﬀ ered saline ( TBS ) . Subsequently , membranes were probed with mouse anti - ALIX ( 1 : 1000 , clone 3A9 , Abcam ) , mouse anti - CD63 ( 1 : 600 , clone MEM - 259 , Abcam ) , mouse anti - actin ( 1 : 1000 , clone JLA20 , Millipore ) , rabbit anti - calnexin ( 1 : 1000 , clone N3C2 , Genetex ) , rabbit anti - CLTC ( 1 : 1000 , polyclonal , Abcam ) , rabbit anti - CAV1 ( 1 : 6000 , clone EPR15554 , Abcam ) , rabbit anti - CDC42 ( 1 : 6000 , EPR15620 , Abcam ) , rabbit anti - ﬂ otillin - 1 ( 1 : 6000 , EPR6041 , Millipore ) , rabbit anti - ARF6 ( 1 : 1000 , EPR8357 , Abcam ) , mouse anti - RhoA ( 1 : 1000 , 1B12 , Abnova ) , mouse anti - Rac1 ( 1 : 1000 , 23A8 , Millipore ) , rabbit anti - PAK1 ( 1 : 1000 , polyclonal , Abcam ) or rabbit anti - ANKFY1 ( 1 : 1000 , polyclonal , Abgent ) antibodies in 50 % v / v Odyssey Blocking Bu ﬀ er in TBS with 0 . 1 % Tween20 ( TBS - T ) . Secondary antibodies included Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti - mouse , Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti - rabbit ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and IRDye 800 donkey anti - mouse ( LI - COR Biosciences ) and were applied at a 1 : 10000 dilution . Protein bands were visualized on an Odyssey Infrared Imager ( LI - COR Biosciences ) at 700 and 800 nm . 2 . 4 . Nanoparticle tracking analysis EV size distribution was determined with a Nanosight NS500 na - noparticle analyser ( Malvern Instruments ) equipped with a 405 nm laser . A camera level of 15 – 16 and automatic functions for all post - acquisition settings except for the detection threshold were used . This was ﬁ xed at 6 . Using the script control function , three 30 s videos for each sample were recorded . Analysis was performed with NTA 3 . 1 software . 2 . 5 . Transmission electron microscopy EVs were adsorbed to carbon - coated formvar grids for 15 min at RT . Unbound EVs were removed by washing with PBS . Grids were ﬁ xated in 2 % paraformaldehyde , 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at RT , counterstained with uranyl - oxalate and embedded in a mixture of 1 . 8 % methyl cellulose and 0 . 4 % uranyl acetate at 4 °C . Imaging was done on a Jeol 1010 microscope ( Jeol ) . 2 . 6 . EV labelling and puri ﬁ cation EVs were labeled with 5 × 10 − 6 M PKH67 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ac - cording to the manufacturer ' s instructions . For removal of unin - corporated label , XK - 16 / 20 column ( GE Healthcare ) was packed with sepharose CL - 4B ( Sigma - Aldrich ) according to the manufacturer ' s in - structions . Column was connected to a refrigerated ÄKTA Start chro - matography system , equilibrated with PBS , and EV / dye mixtures were injected . Pooled EV fractions were concentrated using 100 kD MWCO Amicon Ultra - 15 Centrifugal Filter Units at 4 °C . 2 . 7 . Drug treatments Cells were preincubated with inhibitors before EV addition . For heparin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , cytochalasin D ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , chlorproma - zine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , genistein ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , EIPA ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and wortmannin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , cells were pretreated for 30 min . For simvastatin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , cells were pretreated for 20 h . Inhibitors were present throughout experiments . 2 . 8 . Transfections HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 50000 cells / well in 6 - well plates . After 24 h , cells were transfected with siRNA ( sequences are listed in Table 1 ) using Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Transfection was repeated after an additional 24 h . At 6 h after the second transfection , medium was replaced and cells were incubated for 24 h and reseeded for EV internalization assays , or for 48 h for Western blot analysis . 2 . 9 . EV internalization assays For ﬂ ow cytometric analysis , HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 15000 cells / well in 24 - well plates . After 24 h , cells were pretreated with inhibitors as described above and then incubated with PKH67 - H . Costa Verdera et al . Journal of Controlled Release 266 ( 2017 ) 100 – 108 101 labeled EVs ( from ~ 5 mL CM ) for 4 h in the presence of inhibitors . Subsequently , cells were washed with PBS , washed with acid wash bu ﬀ er ( 0 . 5 M NaCl , 0 . 2 M acetic acid ) to remove membrane - bound EVs and once more with PBS . Cells were trypsinized , ﬁ xated in 0 . 2 % par - aformaldehyde in PBS and subjected to ﬂ ow cytometric analysis on a FACSCanto ( BD Biosciences ) . For confocal microscopy analysis , HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 4000 cells / well in 16 - well chamber slides ( Lab - Tek ) . After 24 h , cells were pretreated with inhibitors as described above and then incubated with PKH67 - labeled EVs ( from ~ 20 mL CM ) for 4 h in the presence of inhibitors . Subsequently , cells were washed with PBS , wa - shed with acid wash bu ﬀ er ( 0 . 5 M NaCl , 0 . 2 M acetic acid ) to remove membrane - bound EVs and once more with PBS . Cells were ﬁ xated with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min . After ﬁ xation , slides were washed with PBS and mounted using Fluorsave ( Calbiochem ) . Confocal ﬂ uorescence imaging was done on a LSM700 laser scanning confocal microscope ( Zeiss ) . Images were processed using LSM Image Browser . Contrast and brightness parameter adjust - ments were applied across whole images and equally across comparison groups when necessary . 2 . 10 . Spheroid formation and EV internalization assays Spheroids were grown in a 96 well Insphero Gravity TRAP ™ ULA plate ( Perkin Elmer ) . Wells were prewet with 10 μ L of media . HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 1000 cells / well , after which plates were centrifuged at 250 × g for 2 min and allowed to incubate for 48 h prior to treatment . Spheroids were pretreated with inhibitors as described above and then incubated with PKH67 - labeled EVs ( from ~ 20 mL CM ) for 4 h in the presence of inhibitors . Subsequently , cells were washed with PBS , washed with acid wash bu ﬀ er ( 0 . 5 M NaCl , 0 . 2 M acetic acid ) to remove membrane - bound EVs and twice more with PBS . For ﬂ ow cytometric analysis , cells were trypsinized , ﬁ xed in 0 . 2 % paraf - ormaldehyde in PBS and subjected to ﬂ ow cytometric analysis on a FACSCanto ( BD Biosciences ) . For confocal microscopy analysis , spher - oids were ﬁ xated with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS at room tem - perature for 20 min . After ﬁ xation , spheroids were washed with PBS and transferred to μ View clear - bottom 96 well plates ( Greiner Bio - One ) . Confocal ﬂ uorescence imaging was done on a Yokogawa Cell Voyager 7000 ( Yokogawa ) . Images were processed using Fiji . Contrast and brightness parameter adjustments were applied across whole images and equally across comparison groups when necessary . 2 . 11 . Statistical analysis Comparisons between two groups were performed using in - dependent two sample t - tests . Multiple - group testing was performed using one - way ANOVA with Dunnett ' s post - hoc tests . 3 . Results EVs were isolated from conditioned medium from A431 cells using a recently described procedure based on ultra ﬁ ltration followed by size - exclusion chromatography [ 25 ] . EVs were collected in serum - free medium , thus avoiding potential contamination with FBS - derived EVs . Western Blot characterization revealed that EV marker proteins Alix and CD63 were strongly enriched in EVs compared to cell lysate , while the opposite was observed for calnexin , an integral protein of the en - doplasmic reticulum ( Fig . 1A ) . Actin was found at similar levels in EVs and cell lysate . NTA showed that the majority of EVs were in a size range of 60 – 250 nm , peaking at 100 nm ( Fig . 1B ) . Transmission elec - tron microscopy analysis indicated that EVs were spherical , membrane - bound particles with most vesicles having a diameter around 100 nm ( Fig . 1C ) . To study internalization of EVs by HeLa cells , puri ﬁ ed EVs were ﬂ uorescently labeled with the membrane dye PKH67 . Shortly after incubation with EVs , a punctuated pattern of ﬂ uorescence could be observed intracellularly , with increasing signal over time . Uptake was inhibited by an excess of unlabeled EVs , as shown by ﬂ ow cytometry ( Fig . 1D ) and confocal microscopy analysis ( Fig . 1E ) . This indicates that EV uptake is mediated by speci ﬁ c processes and also excludes a sig - ni ﬁ cant contribution of transfer of free PKH dye to the observed ﬂ uorescent signal . EV internalization was completely inhibited at 4 °C ( Fig . 1F , G ) , which indicates that it is mediated by active , energy - de - pendent endocytic processes , as opposed to passive membrane fusion . Furthermore , EV internalization was found to be time - dependent ( Fig . 1H ) , and signi ﬁ cantly inhibited in the presence of heparin ( Fig . 1I ) , a soluble analogue of heparan sulfate proteoglycans , as de - scribed previously [ 26 , 27 ] . Cytochalasin D , an inhibitor of actin poly - merization , signi ﬁ cantly inhibited EV uptake , suggesting that endocytic mechanisms requiring cytoskeletal remodeling are involved . To unravel the contribution of speci ﬁ c endocytic processes to EV internalization , recipient cells were pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors known to interfere with di ﬀ erent pathways . Chlorpromazine , which blocks CDE by interfering with the association between clathrin and the plasma membrane [ 28 ] , did not inhibit , but slightly enhanced , EV uptake , as shown by ﬂ ow cytometry ( Fig . 2A ) and confocal micro - scopy ( Fig . 2B ) . This may be the result of a change in the activity of other endocytic mechanisms as compensation for alterations in CDE , a Table 1 siRNA sequences .

H . Costa Verdera et al . Journal of Controlled Release 266 ( 2017 ) 100 – 108 102 phenomenon known as cross - regulation [ 20 ] . In contrast , chlorproma - zine dose - dependently inhibited uptake of transferrin , an established CDE marker ( Fig . S1 ) , showing that chlorpromazine has the expected activity in these cells . Together , these results suggest that CDE does not signi ﬁ cantly contribute to EV internalization . Genistein is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that causes local disruption of the actin network and can inhibit the recruitment of dynamin to plasma membranes , both of which are important in CIE [ 29 ] . EV uptake was dose - dependently in - hibited by genistein , suggesting a role for CIE in their internalization ( Fig . 2C , D ) . As CIE includes several pathways which share a de - pendency on cholesterol , we next pretreated cells with simvastatin , an inhibitor of 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase , an en - zyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol [ 30 ] . Simvastatin treat - ment dose - dependently inhibited EV uptake ( Fig . 2E ) , indicating that the presence of cholesterol is indispensable for EV uptake , again sug - gesting the importance of CIE as uptake route . For the study of MP , cells were pretreated with 5 - ( N - ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amirolide ( EIPA ) , an in - hibitor of Na + / H + exchange , known to inhibit MP by lowering sub - membranous pH , which a ﬀ ects Rac1 activation and actin assembly [ 31 ] . EIPA dose - dependently restricted EV internalization ( Fig . 2F , G ) . Similar results were obtained for the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI ( 3 ) K ) inhibitor wortmannin ( Fig . 2H ) . PI ( 3 ) K participates in the signaling cascade that stimulates membrane ru ﬄ ing and closes the macropino - somes during MP [ 32 ] . Together , these ﬁ ndings suggest the importance of clathrin - independent endocytosis and macropinocytosis for EV up - take . Interestingly , none of the inhibitors of either CIE or MP resulted in complete inhibition of EV uptake , indicating a contribution from both pathways . To evaluate whether inhibition of both pathways had an additive e ﬀ ect , cells were pretreated simultaneously with both EIPA and genistein . While each of the individual inhibitors reduced EV up - take by ~ 50 % , the combination treatment almost completely blocked internalization ( Fig . 3A ) , suggesting that CIE and MP are processes that independently contribute . As constitutive MP occurs at very low levels in epithelial cells , we next evaluated whether EVs themselves could induce MP . After incubation with EVs , uptake of the ﬂ uid phase marker dextran ( 70 kDa ) increased substantially ( Fig . 3B ) , indicating that EVs are capable of stimulating macropinocytosis , and thereby their own internalization . Due to their reported low speci ﬁ city in some cell types , chemical inhibitors alone may not be su ﬃ cient to fully elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to uptake of EVs . For example , genistein may also Fig . 1 . EVs are internalized by HeLa cells . ( A ) Western Blot analysis of Alix , CD63 , Actin and Calnexin in A431 cell lysate ( CL ) and EVs .

Furthermore , cholesterol is not only important for CIE , but also for MP [ 34 ] . Therefore , we next sought to con ﬁ rm our ob - servations and evaluate the key contributors involved in EV internalization through RNAi - mediated knockdown of speci ﬁ c proteins . These proteins included clathrin heavy chain ( CLTC ) , a major subunit of clathrin , caveolin - 1 ( CAV - 1 ) , CDC42 , Flotillin - 1 ( Flot1 ) , ARF6 , and RhoA , key endocytic proteins regulating di ﬀ erent subclasses of CIE , and Rac1 , PAK1 and ANKFY1 , proteins previously shown to regulate MP Fig . 2 .

Costa Verdera et al . Journal of Controlled Release 266 ( 2017 ) 100 – 108 104 [ 21 ] . After two rounds of transfection , signi ﬁ cant downregulation of target proteins was observed ( Fig . 4A ) . Depletion of CLTC had no e ﬀ ect on EV internalization , con ﬁ rming that uptake of EVs is independent of CDE . EV internalization was signi ﬁ cantly inhibited after knockdown of caveolin - 1 , ﬂ otillin - 1 , and RhoA , but not ARF6 and CDC42 , suggesting a contribution of the caveolae - , ﬂ otillin - 1 - , and RhoA - dependent sub - classes of CIE ( Fig . 4B ) . Lastly , we observed a signi ﬁ cant inhibition of EV uptake upon downregulation of MP regulators Rac1 and PAK1 . The e ﬀ ects of knockdown of CLTC , Flotillin and PAK1 as markers of CDE , CIE and MP , respectively , on EV internalization were con ﬁ rmed by confocal microscopy analysis ( Fig . 4C ) . Compared with 2D monolayers , culturing cells in 3D spheroids may be more representative of the in vivo environment , and has been shown to a ﬀ ect cell metabolism , interaction of cells with each other and the extracellular matrix , as well as cell polarity and gene pro ﬁ les ( including receptor expression ) [ 35 ] . Therefore , we next evaluated endocytic mechanisms involved in EV uptake into 3D spheroids . In contrast to the 2D monolayer , in which all cells had taken up EVs within a 4 h time frame , uptake into spheroids was mainly restricted to the outer few cell layers . Similar to results obtained using monolayer cultures , genistein and EIPA , but not chlorpromazine , substantially inhibited EV uptake ( Fig . 5A ) . EIPA also displayed a slight e ﬀ ect on spheroid compactness ( bright ﬁ eld pictures ) . Flow cytometric analysis revealed that both the ﬂ uorescent signal per cell ( Fig . 5B ) as well as the percentage of EV - positive cells ( Fig . 5C ) were signi ﬁ cantly reduced after treatment with genistein or EIPA . Taken together , our results show that EVs are in - ternalized through CIE and MP in 2D monolayers as well as 3D spher - oids . 4 . Discussion EVs are gaining increasing interest from both academia and industry as endogenous nanoparticles with properties that makes them highly suitable for therapeutic applications such as regenerative medicine and drug delivery [ 6 , 36 ] . Naturally equipped to deliver their biological cargo , EVs are capable of modulating or reprogramming recipient cells . However , whether these phenotypic responses are elicited may cru - cially depend on the mechanism of EV uptake , similar to what has been described for viruses [ 37 ] and synthetic nanoparticles [ 22 , 38 ] . In this study , using both pharmacological and RNAi - mediated in - hibition of endocytic pathways , we show that EV internalization occurs via independent contributions of CIE and MP . Following the assessment of EV internalization in 2D monolayer conditions , similar evaluations were performed in 3D spheroid culture . 3D culture more closely mimics in vivo cellular organization ( e . g . cellular polarization , interaction with extracellular matrix ) , potentially including essential features required for correct EV internalization and processing [ 39 ] . Similar inhibitory e ﬀ ects of genistein and EIPA , but not chlorpromazine , were observed on 3D spheroids versus 2D cell culture , suggesting that our results may , to the best of our knowledge , also be representative for the in vivo si - tuation . To study the involvement of CIE in EV uptake , we employed the small molecule inhibitors genistein and simvastatin . For both inhibitors , a dose - dependent e ﬀ ect on EV uptake was observed . Although often used for membrane cholesterol depletion , recent work indicates that statins may also have other e ﬀ ects on cells , including an e ﬀ ect on Rab prenylation and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis [ 40 ] . Classically , me - thyl - β - cyclodextrin and ﬁ lipin , inhibitors known to a ﬀ ect structure and function of cholesterol - rich membrane domains , are being used to study Fig . 4 .

However , these drugs may also interact with cholesterol in EV membranes , thereby a ﬀ ecting EV membrane integrity , and thereby in - directly in ﬂ uencing EV uptake [ 41 ] . Therefore , we also used RNAi to inhibit expression of proteins with known involvements in speci ﬁ c subclasses of CIE , and discovered signi ﬁ cant contributions of CAV - 1 , ﬂ otillin - 1 and RhoA to EV uptake . Caveolins and ﬂ otillins constitute a group of proteins that are enriched in speci ﬁ c microdomains within the plasma membrane , known as lipid rafts . These microdomains contain high concentrations of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids and are known sites for endocytosis . Thus , lipid rafts may be involved in EV uptake , as also previously suggested by others [ 16 , 42 ] . Our observation that EV internalization was signi ﬁ cantly inhibited even after partial knockdown of RhoA ( Fig . 4A ) suggests that RhoA - dependent en - docytosis also plays a strong role . However , caution should be taken , as possible contributions of RhoA to other internalization mechanisms have not been completely ruled out , and interfering with RhoA sig - naling is likely to a ﬀ ect many other cellular processes [ 20 ] . Our experiments using chemical inhibitors EIPA and wortmannin suggest an important contribution for MP in EV internalization . To con ﬁ rm these observations , we silenced Rac1 , PAK1 and ANKFY1 , proteins previously implicated to play important roles in MP . While Rac1 and PAK1 inhibition attenuated EV internalization , we found no signi ﬁ cant e ﬀ ect after ANKFY1 knockdown . The reason for the apparent lack of importance for ANKFY1 in this process is unknown . Although PAK1 serves as target for both small GTP binding proteins Rac1 and CDC42 , our data seem to suggest that CDC42 is not involved in EV uptake . This may be explained by the fact that Rac1 is thought to be required for growth factor - induced MP , whereas CDC42 has a role in constitutive MP , which occurs only at very low levels in HeLa cells [ 43 , 44 ] . Concordantly , it has previously been shown that induction of MP ( through stimulation of growth factor receptors or Ras transfor - mation ) enhances EV uptake [ 45 ] . Here , we demonstrate that EVs themselves can also stimulate MP , thereby potentiating their own up - take . The mechanisms underlying this observation are unclear , but may involve EV cargo - mediated activation of signaling pathways ( e . g . phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) [ 46 ] , ras [ 47 ] , and src [ 48 ] ) that trigger MP induction . Our data that indicate that EVs are taken up via CIE and MP , but not CDE , contrast with some results obtained by others . For example , CDE was shown to be involved in uptake of prostate cancer cell - derived EVs by mesenchymal stromal cells [ 49 ] . In this study , results from CAV1 knockdown experiments also ruled out an involvement of caveolae - mediated endocytosis in the uptake process . Conversely , our results coincide with others who revealed a lack of involvement of CDE , but support a role for CIE in EV uptake [ 16 , 50 ] . Nevertheless , there are still discrepancies in some of the observations , as suppression of CAV1 ex - pression increased EV uptake by embryonic ﬁ broblast cells [ 16 ] , an opposite e ﬀ ect to that observed here ( Fig . 4B ) . Comparison and inter - pretation of these di ﬀ erent reports is however complicated by the fact that , at least in some cell types , alterations in CAV1 expression may also a ﬀ ect ﬂ uid phase as well as CDC42 - dependent uptake [ 51 , 52 ] . Simi - larly , while several reports suggested that cells internalize EVs via MP [ 18 , 49 , 53 ] , others did not ﬁ nd a role for MP in EV uptake [ 54 , 55 ] . However , these results were based on experiments using small molecule inhibitors only . We provide further evidence supporting the involve - ment of MP through RNAi - mediated depletion of proteins that are es - sential for this process . Collectively , these ﬁ ndings demonstrate that EV uptake may rely on a variety of endocytic mechanisms , depending on the EV donor cell type and recipient cell type . The observation that multiple , independently contributing path - ways are involved in EV internalization presents the intriguing possi - bility that distinct EV subpopulations are di ﬀ erentially processed by cells . While it is generally accepted that cells release at least three types of EVs , i . e . apoptotic bodies , microvesicles and exosomes , increasing Fig . 5 . Inhibition of clathrin - independent endocytosis or macropinocytosis attenuates EV internalization in spheroids . EV uptake by HeLa spheroids in the presence of chlorpromazine ( 10 μ M ) , genistein ( 200 μ M ) or EIPA ( 100 μ M ) as visualized by confocal microscopy ( A ) or quanti ﬁ ed by ﬂ ow cytometry ( B , C ) . Pictures represent planes at the indicated depths within the spheroids . Scale bars represents 100 μ m . Values represent mean + S . E . M . * p < 0 . 05 . H . Costa Verdera et al . Journal of Controlled Release 266 ( 2017 ) 100 – 108 106 evidence suggests that even within these groups , distinct subpopula - tions can be discriminated [ 56 , 57 ] . These subpopulations express un - ique surface protein repertoires and may therefore di ﬀ erentially in - teract with recipient cells . These speci ﬁ c protein - protein interactions may be important factors in the pathway selection of EV entry into cells [ 41 ] . Our EV preparation , obtained using size - exclusion chromato - graphy , likely contains a mixture of di ﬀ erent EV subpopulations and this may have resulted in di ﬀ erent endocytic mechanisms being in - volved . In addition , it is well - known that subpopulations of EVs di ﬀ er in physical properties , including size . Although non - phagocytic cells are , in principle , able to internalize particles < 1 μ m in size , particle size can a ﬀ ect the internalization pathway . For example , the size limit for particles to enter cells via clathrin - mediated endocytosis has been re - ported to be ~ 200 nm [ 58 , 59 ] . In addition , multiple reports suggest that size limitations of caveolae limit the internalization of nano - particles larger than the size of individual caveolae ( ~ 50 – 100 nm ) [ 60 , 61 ] . There appears to be no upper size limit for cargo internalized by macropinocytosis . In our experiments , according to NTA , the ma - jority of EVs were between 50 and 150 nm in size , but also EVs larger than 200 nm were observed . Whether EVs with di ﬀ erent sizes are preferentially internalized via speci ﬁ c pathways requires further re - search . Internalization through any of the endocytic pathways leads to de - livery of endocytosed cargo ( i . e . EVs and their cargo ) into the en - dosomal - lysosomal degradative pathway . Despite the multitude of evidence that EVs are capable of delivering their cargo in a functional manner ( e . g . to the cytosol of target cells in the case of miRNA or mRNA ) , the mechanisms underlying endosomal escape and / or active transport of EV cargo out of endosomes remain completely unknown . In this respect , the recent observation that EVs , internalized through MP , displayed a higher cargo delivery e ﬃ ciency to pancreatic cancer cells as compared to liposomes , internalized through other mechanisms [ 53 ] , might indicate that MP is a productive entry pathway . Furthermore , endosomes containing EVs have been shown to be targeted to scan the endoplasmic reticulum as a possible site of cargo release , which would allow directed delivery of EV - associated miRNA or mRNA into the translation machinery [ 19 ] . These studies might provide new directions for understanding the apparent e ﬃ cacy of EV signaling . In conclusion , we have shown that EVs enter HeLa cells via clathrin - independent endocytosis and macropinocytosis , and not via clathrin - dependent endocytosis . However , further research is warranted in order to be able to de ﬁ ne the contributions of the various uptake mechanisms to EV function , and how this depends on the properties of EV producer and recipient cells . Ultimately , a relationship between 1 ) pathways that lead to functional delivery and 2 ) EV components that promote uptake or ensure correct intracellular tra ﬃ cking via those pathways may be established . Identi ﬁ cation of EV components that promote their uptake via pathways that lead to functional cargo transfer will allow devel - opment of more e ﬃ cient delivery systems through EV - inspired en - gineering . However , the apparent complexity of the uptake process and the multiplicity of elements that seem to be involved highlight the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach to such research .
