However , these inducers either 26 cannot be controlled with precision in space and time or cannot be applied in optically dense 27 settings , limiting their application in tissues and organisms . Here we introduce a protein module 28 whose active state can be reversibly toggled with a small change in temperature , a stimulus that 29 is both penetrant and dynamic . This protein , called Melt ( Membrane localization through 30 temperature ) , exists as a monomer in the cytoplasm at elevated temperatures but both 31 oligomerizes and translocates to the plasma membrane when temperature is lowered . Using 32 custom devices for rapid and high - throughput temperature control during live - cell microscopy , 33 we find that the original Melt variant fully switches states between 28 - 32°C , and state changes 34 can be observed within minutes of temperature changes . Melt was highly modular , permitting 35 thermal control over diverse intracellular processes including signaling , proteolysis , and nuclear 36 shuttling through straightforward end - to - end fusions with no further engineering . Melt was also 37 highly tunable , giving rise to a library of Melt variants with switch point temperatures ranging 38 from 30 - 40°C . The variants with higher switch points allowed control of molecular circuits 39 between 37°C - 41°C , a well - tolerated range for mammalian cells . Finally , Melt could thermally 40 regulate important cell decisions over this range , including cytoskeletal rearrangement and 41 apoptosis . Thus Melt represents a versatile thermogenetic module that provides straightforward , 42 temperature - based , real - time control of mammalian cells with broad potential for biotechnology 43 and biomedicine . 44 Main Text : 45 Inducible proteins provide a wealth of strategies for on - demand , remote control of cell 46 behavior , for example using chemicals or light as inputs . These inputs trigger protein 47 conformational changes that can regulate a vast array of downstream protein and cell behaviors 48 in a modular manner . While chemical control requires delivery of a small molecule , light can be 49 applied remotely and offers further benefits for precision in both space and time , as well as low 50 cost of the inducer . There is tremendous potential to extend these benefits into more complex 51 settings including in 3D cell and tissue models , in patients for control of cell therapy , or in dense 52 bioreactors for bioproduction . However , optical control is limited in these more opaque settings 53 because visible light cannot penetrate , for example scattering within millimeters of entering 54 human tissue 1 , 2 . There is thus a need for alternative inducer strategies that couple the 55 penetration of chemical induction with the spatiotemporal precision of optogenetics . 56 57 Temperature has gained recent interest as a dynamic and penetrant inducer 3 – 6 . Unlike 58 light , temperature can be regulated tens of cm deep within tissue with sub - millimeter - scale 59 precision using technologies like focused ultrasound that are already used in the clinic 7 . 60 Furthermore , unlike either chemical - or light - induction , thermal - responsiveness could uniquely 61 interface with an organism’s own stimuli , setting the stage for engineered biological systems 62 that autonomously detect and respond to physiological temperature cues , for example fevers or 63 inflammation . 64 65 The widespread adoption of chemo - and opto - genetic proteins was enabled by the 66 identification protein domains that undergo stereotyped and consistent changes in response to 67 small molecules or light . However , remarkably few analogous temperature - sensing modules 68 have been described . Endogenous heat shock promoters have been used for thermal control of 69 transcription , including to induce tumor clearance by engineered cells 4 , 8 , 9 . However heat shock 70 promoters can respond to non - thermal stimuli 10 – 12 , and thermal response profiles cannot be 71 readily tuned because they depend on the cell’s repertoire of heat shock factor proteins . 72 Moreover , many desirable cell behaviors ( e . g . migration , proliferation , survival / death ) cannot be 73 easily controlled at the transcriptional level . At the post - translational level , temperature - 74 sensitive ( Ts ) mutants are protein variants that denature at elevated temperatures 13 – 15 . 75 However , Ts mutations are generally not modular or reversible and must be laboriously 76 validated for each individual target . The TlpA protein from Salmonella forms thermolabile 77 dimers 16 and underlies existing thermosensitive engineered proteins , including a temperature - 78 controlled dimerization module 17 . However TlpA - based dimers are large ( ~ 600 - 700 amino 79 acids in combined size ) , and may be limited by the need for stoichiometric tuning between the 80 two components . The identification of distinct temperature - responsive proteins , especially with 81 functions beyond dimerization , is critical for broad development and application of 82 thermogenetic approaches . 83 84 Here we introduce a unique thermoresponsive protein module called Melt ( Membrane 85 localization using temperature ) , which we derived from the naturally light - and temperature - 86 sensitive BcLOV4 protein 18 . Melt is a single protein that clusters and binds the plasma 87 membrane at low temperatures but dissociates and declusters upon heating . Using live - cell 88 imaging coupled with custom devices for precise temperature control in 96 - well plates , we found 89 that Melt could be toggled between these two states rapidly and reversibly , with observable 90 membrane dissociation and recovery within 10s of minutes . The Melt approach was highly 91 modular , allowing thermal control of diverse processes including EGFR and Ras signaling , 92 TEVp proteolysis , and subcellular localization through simple end - to - end fusion of the 93 appropriate effectors . We then tuned Melt to increase its switchpoint temperature above the 94 native 30°C . Such tuning resulted in Melt variants that operated with switch point temperatures 95 between 30 - 40°C , including ones that bound the membrane at 37°C and fully dissociated at 96 39°C or 42°C , temperature ranges suitable for downstream application in mammalian tissues . 97 These variants controlled multiple post - translational circuits between 37°C and 42°C and could 98 regulate important cell - level behaviors including cytoskeletal reorganization and apoptosis . Thus 99 Melt offers a straightforward , tunable , and broadly applicable platform for endowing thermal 100 control across a wide range of molecular and cellular behaviors . 101 RESULTS 102 BcLOV4 is a modular optogenetic protein that natively responds to both blue light and 103 temperature 18 , 19 ( Figure 1A ) . Light stimulation triggers its clustering and translocation from the 104 cytoplasm to the plasma membrane , where it binds anionic phospholipids 19 , 20 . However , its 105 persistence at the membrane requires both continued light and a permissive temperature . At 106 temperatures above 29°C , membrane binding is transient ; BcLOV4 binds but then returns to the 107 cytoplasm ( Figure 1A - C ) at a rate that increases with temperature 18 . Our previous report found 108 that , once dissociated due to elevated temperatures , BcLOV4 remains in the cytoplasm and no 109 longer responds to light stimuli 18 . However , we found that lowering temperature below the 29°C 110 threshold reversed this inactivation and restored light - dependent membrane localization ( Figure 111 1C ) . Thus , temperature alone could be used to toggle the localization of BcLOV4 given the 112 continued presence of blue light . 113 We sought to harness this thermal responsiveness to generate a protein actuator that 114 responded only to temperature . We reasoned that a BcLOV4 variant with a point mutation that 115 mimicked the “lit” state would localize to the membrane independent of light status but should 116 retain thermal sensitivity ( Figure 1D ) . We thus introduced a Q356N mutation that disrupts the 117 dark - state interaction between the Jα helix and the core of the LOV domain 19 , 21 . When 118 expressed in HEK 293T cells at 37°C , BcLOV ( Q356N ) - mCh appeared mostly cytoplasmic and 119 did not respond to blue light ( Figure 1E - G ) . Strikingly , shifting the temperature from 37°C to 120 25°C triggered an accumulation of the protein at the plasma membrane , where increasing 121 accumulation was observed within minutes and continued over the next three hours ( Figure 1D - 122 H ) . Membrane localization of Melt was often accompanied by visible clustering at the 123 membrane , consistent with our prior findings that clustering and membrane - binding are 124 interlinked properties of BcLOV4 20 ( Fig 1B , C , F ) . Conversely , the native photosensitive 125 BcLOV4 did not accumulate at the membrane in response to temperature in the absence of light 126 ( Figure 1G , H ) . Thus , BcLOV4 ( Q356N ) —henceforth referred to as Melt ( Membrane localization 127 using temperature ) —is a light - insensitive protein whose subcellular localization can be 128 regulated solely by temperature . 129 We next sought to comprehensively characterize the thermal response properties of 130 Melt , including how the amplitude and kinetics of membrane dissociation / reassociation varied 131 with time and temperature . To systematically explore this large parameter space , we developed 132 a device that allowed rapid , programmable heating of individual wells of 96 - well plates . This 133 device—the thermoPlate—has 96 pairs of thermistors arrayed in the format of a standard 96 - 134 well plate ( Figure 2A ) . One thermistor serves as a miniature immersion heater ( heater , Figure 135 2B , C ) that heats the medium through resistive heating , while the second acts as a thermometer 136 ( reader , Figure 2B , C ) that measures the temperature of the medium in a well . The heater and 137 reader implement proportional - integral - derivative ( PID ) feedback control , which maintains a pre - 138 defined temperature profile over even day - long experiments ( Figure 2D ) . Because the 139 thermoPlate has a thin profile and is positioned above a 96 - well plate , it allows simultaneous 140 live - cell imaging of the sample using an inverted microscope . 141 We first used multiplexed temperature control to measure steady - state Melt membrane 142 association over a range of temperatures after 24 hrs of heating ( Figure 2E ) . Membrane 143 association was maximal at 27°C and minimal at 32°C , and reached 50 % of this range at 144 ~ 30°C , which we assign as its switch temperature . The thermoPlate also permits observation of 145 fast thermal response dynamics by allowing rapid temperature changes ( e . g . 10 degrees 146 heating in 2 . 5 mins , 10 degrees cooling in 6 minutes , Figure 2F ) . By toggling temperature 147 between 27 and 37 , we could demonstrate reversible membrane binding and dissociation over 148 multiple cycles ( Figure 2G , H , Supplementary Movie 1 ) . For full details on membrane binding 149 quantification , see Figure S1 and Methods . 150 We next examined the kinetics of Melt translocation to and from the membrane . 151 Dissociation kinetics increased with higher temperatures ( Figure 2I ) . Notably , although steady - 152 state membrane association was unchanged above 32°C ( Figure 2E ) , the rate with which Melt 153 reached this steady state level continued to increase with temperature ( note the higher decay 154 rate at 34°C and 37°C relative to 32°C , ( Figure 2I ) . Reassociation kinetics depended on the 155 thermal stimulation history . Samples that were stimulated at higher temperatures showed a 156 lower degree of reversibility ( Figure 2J ) . Reversibility was also a function of the duration of prior 157 stimulation . Although dissociation after 30 min of heating at 37°C was fully reversible , longer 158 stimulation led to smaller degrees of reversion ( Figure 2K ) . Collectively , these data suggest that 159 Melt is a thermoswitch that operates tunably and reversibly within a 27 - 32°C range , but whose 160 reversibility is a function of the magnitude of its prior stimulation . 161 We explored the potential of Melt to control molecular circuits in mammalian cells in 162 response to temperature changes . Recruitment of cargo to / from the membrane is a powerful 163 mode of post - translational control , including for cell signaling 22 . We first targeted signaling 164 through the Ras - Erk pathway , a central regulator of cell growth and cancer . We generated an 165 end - to - end fusion of Melt to the catalytic domain of the Ras activator SOS2 23 , an architecture 166 that previously allowed potent stimulation of Ras signaling using optogenetic BcLOV4 18 . We 167 expressed this construct ( meltSOS ) in HEK 293T cells and measured Erk activation upon 168 changing temperature from 37°C to 27°C ( Fig 3A ) . Active Erk ( phospho - Erk , or ppErk ) could be 169 observed even within 5 minutes of temperature change to 27°C and continued to rise until its 170 plateau at 30 mins ( Fig 3B , C ) . Conversely , shifting temperature from 27°C back to 37°C 171 resulted in measurable signal decrease within 5 min and full decay within 30 mins ( Figure 172 3B , C ) , comparable to the kinetics of thermal inactivation during optogenetic stimulation of 173 BcLOV - SOS 18 . 174 175 Separately , we tested whether we could leverage the clustering of Melt for control of 176 signaling from the receptor level . We generated a fusion of Melt to the intracellular domain of 177 the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( Figure 3D ) . EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase 178 with important roles in development and tumorigenesis and stimulates intracellular signaling 179 through multiple pathways , including Ras - Erk 24 . Importantly , both membrane recruitment and 180 clustering of the EGFR intracellular domain are required for its activation 20 , 25 . In cells 181 expressing meltEGFR , lowering the temperature from 37°C to 27°C activated strong Erk 182 signaling within 10 minutes , and reversion to 37°C caused signal decay within 5 minutes , with 183 full decay within 30 - 60 mins ( Figure 3E , F ) . Thus , the inducible membrane recruitment and 184 clustering of Melt can be used for rapid , potent , and reversible thermal control of signaling in a 185 modular fashion . 186 187 When Melt activates proteins at the membrane , it operates as a heat - OFF system . We 188 next examined whether Melt could also implement a heat - ON system by coupling membrane 189 translocation to negative regulation . Proteases can negatively regulate their targets through 190 protein cleavage in both natural and synthetic systems 26 – 28 . We thus tested whether Melt could 191 regulate proteolysis at the membrane . We fused Melt to the viral TEV protease ( meltTEVp ) and 192 we measured whether its membrane recruitment could trigger a membrane - associated reporter 193 of TEVp activity , FlipGFP 29 ( FlipGFP - CAAX ) . FlipGFP is non - fluorescent until proteolytic 194 cleavage allows proper folding and maturation of the chromophore ( Figure 3G ) . Cells that 195 expressed meltTEVp and FlipGFP - CAAX showed minimal levels of fluorescence when cultured 196 at 37°C , similar to cells that expressed FlipGFP - CAAX and cytoplasmic TEVp or FlipGFP - CAAX 197 alone . However , culturing meltTEVp cells at lower temperatures for 24 hours increased FlipGFP 198 fluorescence , with fluorescence increasing monotonically with decreasing temperature , whereas 199 cells expressing cytoplasmic TEVp remained at baseline fluorescence ( Figure 3H , I , Figure S2 ) . 200 Thus , Melt can implement thermal control of proteolysis , providing one method by which it could 201 control downstream circuits as a heat - ON switch . 202 203 A second way to convert Melt to heat - ON is to regulate its subcellular 204 compartmentalization . Here , the plasma membrane would sequester Melt , and heat would 205 release sequestration and allow translocation to a separate compartment where it could perform 206 a desired function . As a proof of concept , we engineered Melt to regulate nuclear localization by 207 fusing it to sequences that facilitate nuclear import and export ( Figure 3J ) . We tested several 208 combinations of nuclear localization sequences ( NLS ) and nuclear export sequences ( NES ) to 209 optimize the relative strengths of import and export ( Figure S3 ) . Melt fused to the SV40 NLS 30 210 and the Stradα NES 31 showed strong membrane binding and nuclear exclusion at 27°C and 211 nuclear enrichment when heated to 37°C ( Figure 3K , L , SMovie 2 ) . This construct could be 212 dynamically shuttled to and from the nucleus through repeated rounds of heating and cooling . 213 By contrast , Melt without NLS / NES showed no nuclear accumulation upon heating ( Figure 214 3K , L ) . Collectively , our results show that Melt can be applied to control a variety of molecular 215 events , in either heat - ON or heat - OFF configuration , in a straightforward and modular manner . 216 217 The utility of Melt in mammals will depend on its ability to induce a strong change in 218 localization in response to temperature , as well as on its ability to operate within a mammalian 219 temperature range ( 37 - 42°C ) . We thus sought to tune these properties . To increase the 220 magnitude of membrane translocation , we tested whether short polybasic ( PB ) peptides could 221 strengthen the electrostatic molecular interactions that mediate BcLOV4 membrane binding 222 ( Figure 4A , B ) 19 , 32 . We chose two well - characterized PB domains from the STIM1 and Rit 223 proteins , which can enhance membrane - binding of unrelated proteins 33 . End - to - end fusions of 224 Melt to the STIM , tandem STIM ( STIM2X ) , or Rit domains all increased the magnitude of 225 membrane binding at 27°C , in increasing order of strength ( Figure 4C , D ) . Kinetic analysis 226 showed that PB domains did not change the rate of Melt dissociation , although some changes 227 in reassociation kinetics were observed ( Figure S4 ) . 228 229 Although PB domains provided a large increase in steady - state membrane binding at 230 27°C , they provided only a mild increase in thermal switch point to ~ 32°C , only 1 - 2 degrees 231 higher than the original Melt ( Figure 4D ) . We achieved a more substantial increase through the 232 fortuitous discovery that the C293 residue plays an important role in defining the Melt thermal 233 response . In wt BcLOV4 , C293 is thought to form a light - dependent bond with a flavin 234 mononucleotide cofactor that underlies the BcLOV4 photoresponse 19 . Although Melt 235 translocation did not respond to light ( Figure 1G ) , introduction of a C293A mutation dramatically 236 increased its membrane association not only at 27°C , but also at 37°C where the original Melt 237 was fully dissociated ( Figure 4F , G , Fig S5 ) . As before , addition of the STIM PB domain further 238 increased membrane association strength at these higher temperatures . Importantly , both 239 C293A variants retained temperature sensitivity and fully dissociated from the membrane at 41 - 240 42°C , with a thermal switch point of 36 . 5 and 39 . 5°C for the C293A and C293A / STIM variants , 241 respectively ( Figure 4H , Figure S6 ) . Because these Melt variants can exist in one state at 37°C 242 and another at 41 / 42°C , they are thus both potentially suitable for actuation within mammalian 243 tissues , with distinct levels of membrane binding and dynamic range that could each be optimal 244 for certain applications . These variants also included a truncation of 96 amino acids from the N - 245 terminal of BcLOV4 , which we found expendable , consistent with previous results 19 . 246 Collectively , our work presents four Melt variants with a range of thermal switch points between 247 30°C and 40°C , covering temperatures suitable for actuation of a broad range animal cells . We 248 adopted a nomenclature for these variants that reflects these switch - points : Melt - 30 , Melt - 32 , 249 Melt - 37 , and Melt - 40 . 250 251 We tested the ability of the higher switch - point Melt variants to actuate post - translational 252 events between 37 and 42°C . meltEGFR driven by Melt - 37 showed strong Erk activation at 253 37°C and only baseline levels at 40 - 41°C ( Figure 4I , J ) . Erk activity could be stimulated 254 repeatedly over multiple heating / cooling cycles as indicated by the ErkKTR biosensor , which 255 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon Erk activation ( Figure 4K , L , 256 Supplementary Movie 3 ) 34 . meltSOS - 37 could also stimulate Erk activity but only at < ~ 37°C , 257 potentially reflecting a requirement for higher levels of membrane translocation relative to 258 meltEGFR 20 ( Figure S7 ) . 259 260 Melt - 37 / 40 could also regulate behaviors that allowed its inversion to a heat - ON signal . 261 Melt - 40 fused to TEVp showed strong proteolysis and FlipGFP activation at 37°C , with markedly 262 reduced activity at 41°C ( Figure 4M - O ) . Melt - 37 also regulated proteolysis but only induced 263 fluorescence at or below 35°C , and fluorescence fell to near baseline at 37°C ( Figure S8 ) . 264 These results further highlight that although the general thermal response properties are 265 dictated by the specific Melt variant , the precise thermal switch point of the downstream process 266 can be influenced by the specific fusion partner or the downstream process itself . Melt - 40 also 267 regulated membrane - to - nuclear translocation within the well - tolerated 37 - 41°C temperature 268 range ( Figure 4P ) . Fusion to a C - terminal SV40 NLS and Stradα NES allowed strong 269 membrane sequestration at 37°C , and fluorescence became enriched in the nucleus upon 270 heating to 41°C ( Figure 4Q , R ) . As before , translocation was partially reversible on the 271 timescales tested and could be cycled through repeated rounds of heating and cooling ( Figure 272 4Q , R , Supplementary Movie 4 ) . 273 274 We then asked whether Melt variants could be used to regulate cellular - level behaviors 275 at and above 37°C . We first sought to control cell shape changes through the control of actin 276 polymerization . We fused Melt - 37 to the DH - PH domain of Intersectin1 ( meltITSN1 - 37 ) , an 277 activator of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 that has previously been actuated through optogenetic 278 recruitment 35 , including with BcLOV4 36 , 37 ( Figure 5A ) . When cooled from 41°C to 37°C , HEK 279 293T cells expressing meltITSN1 showed rapid and dramatic expansion of lamellipodia and cell 280 size , consistent with Cdc42 activation 38 ( Figure 5B ) . Changes in cell shape could be reversed 281 and re - stimulated over multiple cycles of cooling and heating ( Figure 5C ) , showing similar 282 magnitude of shape change in each round ( Figure 5D , S9 , Supplementary Movie 5 ) . By 283 comparison , temperature changes had no effect on cell shape in cells that expressed Melt - 37 284 without the ITSN1 DH - PH domain . 285 286 As a second example , we asked if Melt could be used for thermal control of cell death . 287 Cell death can be achieved by regulated clustering of effector domains of caspase proteins 39 . 288 We reasoned that differential clustering of Melt at different temperatures could be leveraged to 289 regulate caspase activity and cell death . We fused Melt - 37 to the effector domain of caspase - 1 290 ( meltCasp1 - 37 , Figure 5E ) , and we measured cell death upon changes in temperature ( Figure 291 5F ) . While cells expressing meltCasp1 - 37 appeared unperturbed at 38°C , transition to 34°C led 292 to morphological changes within minutes , followed within hours by blebbing and cell death , 293 indicated by both morphology and AnnexinV staining ( Figure 5G , H , Supplementary Movie 6 ) . 294 ThermoPlate scanning coupled with live cell imaging of AnnexinV allowed us to observe death 295 induction with 1°C resolution , revealing cell death induction even when shifting temperature by 296 only 1°C ( from 38°C - 37°C ) , and the magnitude of cell death increased with larger temperature 297 shifts ( Figure 5I , J ) . No death was measured in cells expressing Melt - 37 without the caspase 298 effector . 299 300 Finally , a potential concern for using heat as a stimulus is that heat is a known stressor 301 and could adversely affect cell functions . However , we observed no molecular or functional 302 effects of either the short - or long - term heat profiles used throughout our studies in mammalian 303 cells . Stress granules ( SGs ) , a known consequence of heat - stress 40 , 41 , were not observed at 304 41°C or below in HEK 293T cells , the operating temperatures for the highest switch - point Melt 305 variants ( Figure S10A , B ) . By contrast , SGs could be detected at 42°C in ~ 1 - 5 % of cells , and at 306 43°C all cells showed strong SG formation . Of note , existing strategies for thermal induction 307 ( e . g . heat shock promoters , thermomers ) are typically stimulated with 42°C 4 , 8 , 9 , 17 , at the cusp of 308 this non - linear heat - induced SG response ( Figure S10B ) . We also measured cell proliferation 309 to investigate potential integration of low - level heat stress during multi - hour heating ( Figure 310 S10C ) . Again , regardless of temperature between 37 - 42°C , we measured no difference in the 311 fraction of cells with high phospho - Rb levels , a marker of proliferation , or of total cell counts 312 through 24 hr of heating ( Figure S10D - F ) . 313 314 In sum , membrane binding and clustering of Melt variants can be harnessed to control a 315 diverse array of protein and cell behavior over a broad range of temperatures , including those 316 relevant for mammalian cells , which can be thermally controlled by Melt with a larger buffer from 317 potential heat stress compared to the few alternative approaches . 318 319 DISCUSSION 320 Here we have described a modular and tunable protein that permits thermal control over 321 a range of molecular and cell - level behaviors . By locking the naturally light - and temperature - 322 sensitive BcLOV4 into its “lit” state , we generated the purely thermoresponsive Melt whose 323 membrane association and clustering can be regulated with a small temperature change ( < 4°C ) . 324 Tuning this thermal response further allowed us to generate multiple variants ( Melt - 30 / 32 / 37 / 40 ) 325 whose activation switch points could be shifted within the 30 - 40°C range . These variants 326 allowed temperature - inducible control of signaling , proteolysis , and subcellular localization , 327 including between 37°C - 42°C , a critical range for thermal control within mammals . Finally , we 328 showed that Melt can provide thermal control over cell - level behaviors by changing cell 329 size / shape and cell death . 330 331 Our engineering efforts provide insight into how the wt BcLOV4 protein senses both light 332 and temperature . Successful isolation of the BcLOV4 thermal response from its light response 333 confirms the distinct molecular nature of these two behaviors , as previously speculated 18 . At the 334 same time , the light and temperature responses are closely linked , since mutation of the C293 335 residue in the LOV domain , which mediates photo - responsiveness , dramatically shifted the 336 thermal switchpoint of Melt ( Figure 4E ) . Further mechanistic and structural work will be required 337 to fully understand the molecular basis for BcLOV thermal sensitivity , potentially allowing 338 optimization of Melt properties including speed of response and degree of reversibility , and will 339 shed light on how the photosensing and thermosensing elements of BcLOV4 interact . These 340 latter studies will additionally provide insight for how to engineer novel multi - input proteins that 341 can perform complex logic in response to user - defined stimuli . 342 343 Our work also introduces the thermoPlate , a device for independent reading and writing 344 of temperature within each well of a 96 - well plate . The thermoPlate allows rapid ( ~ minutes ) and 345 dynamic heating and cooling of samples , which allowed quantitative systematic characterization 346 of the kinetics and reversibility of multiple Melt variants . Importantly , multiplexed control of 347 temperature with the thermoPlate is constrained by thermal diffusion , since a hot well will 348 influence the temperature in neighboring wells . However , with careful definition of sample 349 position within a plate , choice of ambient temperature , and PID feedback control , the challenges 350 of thermal diffusion can be overcome . The thermoPlate is fully open source and can be 351 assembled in under 6 hours for ~ $ 400 . We anticipate this device will be highly enabling for any 352 use case where multiplexed or dynamic thermal control is required . 353 354 Multiplexed control of sample temperature allowed us to systematically characterize new 355 Melt variants , ultimately resulting in variants with switch - points ranging from 30 - 40°C . Because 356 BcLOV4 works in mammalian cells but also in systems that are cultured at lower temperatures 357 like yeast , flies , zebrafish , and ciona , 18 , 19 , 36 , 42 – 44 , we anticipate that all Melt variants will find use 358 across these and similar settings . Our work also highlights the utility of having multiple variants 359 in hand to optimize specific downstream applications . We found on multiple occasions that the 360 precise thermal response profiles depended not only on the specific Melt variant but also on the 361 downstream process under control , requiring empirical validation for each use case and 362 biological context . Optimization can be performed by testing other Melt variants , or by 363 generating new ones through additional modifications ( e . g . polybasic domains ) or mutations . 364 365 Melt dramatically expands the range of molecular and cellular events that can be 366 controlled by temperature , and in mammalian cells allows thermal control with lower potential for 367 heat stress relative to the few existing approaches . Melt provides an orthogonal input control on 368 biological systems that can be used in conjunction with—or instead of—existing technologies 369 based on light or chemicals , promising to expand the sophistication and reach of biological 370 control with broad potential for biotechnology and biomedicine . 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 References and Notes 383 1 .

To construct FlipGFP - BFP - CAAX , the two fragments of FlipGFP 687 B1 - 9 and B10 - E5 - B11 - TEVcs - K5 were amplified from Addgene Plasmid # 124429 via PCR . 688 tagBFP 18 was amplified using primers containing a CAAX membrane binding sequence . These 689 fragments were assembled in the linearized PHR backbone via HiFi cloning mix in the order B1 - 690 9 - P2A - B10 - E5 - B11 - TEVcs - K5 - tagBFP - CAAX . In order to reduce affinity of TEVp for the TEV 691 cut site ( cs ) and lower basal proteolysis , the canonical cut site ENLYFQS was mutated to 692 ENLYFQL 45 via whole backbone PCR using primers harboring the mutation . GFP - CAAX was 693 generated via PCR of eGFP using primers containing the CAAX sequence and cloned into the 694 linearized viral backbone using HiFi cloning mix . 695 Plasmid transfection . 696 HEK 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method , as follows : Per 1 mL of 697 media of the cell culture to be transfected , 50 µL of 2x HeBS 28 , 29 buffer , 1 µg of each DNA 698 construct , and H 2 O up to 94 µL was mixed . 6 µL of 2 . 5mM CaCl 2 was added after mixing of 699 initial components , incubated for 1 : 45 minutes at room temperature , and added directly to cell 700 culture . 701 Lentiviral packaging and cell line generation 702 Lentivirus was packaged by cotransfecting the pHR transfer vector , pCMV - dR8 . 91 ( Addgene , 703 catalog number 12263 ) , and pMD2 . G ( Addgene , catalog number 12259 ) into Lenti - X HEK293T . 704 Briefly , cells were seeded one day prior to transfection at a concentration of 350 , 000 cells / mL in 705 a 6 - well plate . Plasmids were transfected using the calcium phosphate method . Media was 706 removed one day post - transfection and replaced with fresh media . Two days post - transfection , 707 media containing virus was collected and centrifuged at 800 x g for 3 minutes . The supernatant 708 was passed through a 0 . 45 µm filter . 500 µL of filtered virus solution was added to 700 , 000 709 HEK293T cells seeded in a 6 - well plate . Cells were expanded over multiple passages , and 710 successfully transduced cells were enriched through fluorescence activated cell sorting ( Aria 711 Fusion ) . 712 713 Preparation of cells for plate - based experiments 714 All experiments were carried out in Cellvis 96 well plates ( # P96 - 1 . 5P ) . Briefly , wells were coated 715 with 50uL of MilliporeSigma™ Chemicon™ Human Plasma Fibronectin Purified Protein 716 fibronectin solution diluted 100x in PBS and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min . HEK 293T cells 717 were seeded in wells at a density of 35 , 000 cells / well in 100 µL and were spun down at 20 x g 718 for 1 minute . In experiments requiring starvation ( for all experiments involving SOS and EGFR 719 constructs ) , after 24 hr , cells were starved by performing 7 80 % washes with starvation media 720 ( DMEM + 1 % P / S ) . Experiments were performed after 3 hr of starvation . 721 Fixing and Immunofluorescence staining 722 Immediately following the completion of a temperature stimulation protocol , 16 % 723 paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) was added to each well to a final concentration of 4 % , and cells were 724 incubated in PFA for 10 min . For immunofluorescence staining , cells were then permeabilized 725 with 100 µL phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) + 0 . 1 % Triton - X for 10 min . Cells were then further 726 permeabilized with ice cold methanol for 10 min . After permeabilization , cells were blocked with 727 1 % BSA at room temperature for 30 min . Primary antibody was diluted in PBS + 1 % BSA 728 according to the manufacturer ' s recommendation for immunofluorescence ( phospho - p44 / 42 729 MAPK ( Erk1 / 2 ) ( Thr202 / Tyr204 ) , Cell Signaling # 4370 , 1 : 400 dilution ; phospho - Rb ( Ser807 / 811 ) 730 Cell Signaling # 9308 , 1 : 800 dilution ; Anti - Human G3BP1 , BD Biosciences # 611126 , 1 : 500 731 dilution ) . Wells were incubated with 50 µL of antibody dilution for 2 hr at room temperature ( RT ) , 732 after which primary antibody was removed and samples underwent five washes in PBS + 0 . 1 % 733 TWEEN - 20 ( PBS - T ) . Cells were then incubated with secondary antibody ( Jackson 734 Immunoresearch Alexa Fluor® 488 AffiniPure Goat Anti - Rabbit IgG ( H + L ) or Invitrogen Goat 735 anti - Mouse IgG ( H + L ) Cross - Adsorbed Secondary Antibody , DyLight™ 650 ) and DAPI 736 ( ThermoFisher , # D1306 , 300 nM ) in PBS - T + 0 . 1 % BSA for 1 hour at RT . Secondary antibody 737 was removed , samples underwent 5 washes with PBS - T . Samples were imaged in PBS - T . 738 739 Imaging 740 Live - cell imaging . Live - cell imaging was performed using a Nikon Ti2 - E microscope equipped 741 with a Yokagawa CSU - W1 spinning disk , 405 / 488 / 561 / 640 nm laser lines , an sCMOS camera 742 ( Photometrics ) , a motorized stage , and an environmental chamber ( Okolabs ) . HEK 293Ts 743 expressing the construct of interest were imaged with a 20X or 40X objective at variable 744 temperatures and 5 % CO 2 . Optogenetic BcLOV4 was stimulated using a 488nm laser . 745 High content fixed - cell imaging . Fixed samples were imaged using a Nikon Ti2E 746 epifluorescence microscope equipped with DAPI / FITC / Texas Red / Cy5 filter cubes , a SOLA SEII 747 365 LED light source , and motorized stage . High content imaging was performed using the 748 Nikon Elements AR software . Image focus was ensured using image - based focusing in the 749 DAPI channel . 750 Image processing and analysis 751 Immunofluorescence quantification . Images were processed using Cell Profiler . Cells were 752 segmented using the DAPI channel , and cytoplasm was identified using a 5 pixel ring around 753 the nucleus . Nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence values were then exported and analyzed 754 using R ( https : / / cran . r - project . org / ) and R - Studio ( https : / / rstudio . com / ) . Data was processed 755 and visualized using the tidyR 46 and ggplot2 47 packages . 756 Membrane recruitment . Membrane localization was quantified using the MorphoLibJ plugin for 757 ImageJ 48 . Briefly , MorphoLibJ was used to segment single cells based on a constitutively 758 membrane bound GFP - CAAX marker . The resulting segmentation was imported into Cell 759 Profiler and was used to quantify the amount of mCherry ( fused to the protein of interest ) 760 localized to the membrane as well as total mCh per cell ( Figure S1 ) . Total mCh and membrane - 761 localized mCh intensity was recorded and further processed in R . Bleaching was corrected by 762 dividing the membrane intensity of mCh by total cell mCh . 763 FlipGFP Quantification . Cells expressing membrane bound FlipGFP - CAAX and the indicated 764 TEVp construct were grown at the indicated temperature and fixed in 4 % PFA after 24 hours . 765 FlipGFP was tethered to the membrane via a Blue Fluorescent Protein ( TagBFP ) - CAAX fusion . 766 BFP - CAAX remained tethered to the membrane before and after proteolysis and thus could be 767 used as a membrane marker . This marker was used to segment single cells using the same 768 workflow used for membrane recruitment quantification . Single cell GFP levels were quantified 769 using Cell Profiler and used as an indicator of relative levels of proteolysis . 770 Nuclear Localization . To quantify nuclear localization of a protein of interest , cells expressing a 771 GFP - CAAX membrane marker ( see above ) were transfected with an H2B - iRFP nuclear marker . 772 The above workflow was used to segment individual cells based on the membrane marker . This 773 segmentation was imported to CellProfiler , which was also used to segment nuclei based on 774 iRFP imaging . Each nucleus was then assigned to a parent cell . Nuclei were assigned to a cell if 775 > 90 % of the nucleus object was contained by the cell object . Membrane segmented cells that 776 contained no nuclei objects or nuclei that were not within a parent cell were eliminated from 777 quantification . Finally , nuclear to total cell mCherry ( used as a marker fused to the protein of 778 interest ) was calculated and recorded for each cell . 779 Annexin Staining and Quantification . Annexin V - 647 ( Invitrogen A23204 ) was added to 100 µL 780 of cell culture at a 1 : 100 final dilution . A final concentration of 1 mM CaCl 2 was also added to 781 each well to allow Annexin V cell labeling . Cell media was removed and replaced with Annexin 782 V media 30 min prior to imaging . To quantify Annexin V , images of cells expressing meltCasp1 - 783 37 or Melt - 37 both with a GFP fusion were used to create GFP masks using CellProfiler’s 784 threshold function . Annexin images were masked for GFP positive pixels . The total masked 785 Annexin image intensity was recorded and normalized by the number of GFP positive pixels 786 ( cell area per image ) in each image . 787 Cell Area Quantification . Cell area was measured semi - manually . Images of cells expressing 788 meltITSN1 - 37 and Melt - 37 were imaged and resulting images were thresholded in ImageJ such 789 that cell positive pixels were set to 1 and background pixels were set to 0 . Cells were manually 790 chosen for quantification and regions containing the cell of interest were drawn by hand . 791 Measuring integrated pixel intensity of these regions gave rise to the number of cell positive 792 pixels in that region which was used as a metric of total cell area . For further explanation , see 793 Figure S9 . 794 Curve fitting 795 Data points for Melt variant equilibrium membrane binding at various temperatures were 796 fit to the Hill Equation ( Eq . 1 ) . MATLAB was used to minimize the error between the sigmoid 797 function and each data point . The characteristic function used for fitting was : 798 𝐹 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 ∗ 𝑥 ! / ( 𝐶 ! + 𝑥 ! ) ( Eq . 1 ) 799 A , B , and C were used as the adjusted parameters . These curves are displayed in Figure 2E , 800 4D , and 4H with datapoints overlaid . The associated code can be found in this manuscript’s 801 code repository ( https : / / rb . gy / 1k7tc ) . 802 Supplemental Figures 803 804 805 Figure S1 . Schematic of workflow for quantification of membrane association . 806 Experiments were performed in cells stably expressing a GFP - CAAX membrane marker . Image 807 analysis was performed using the MorphoLibJ plugin for ImageJ to enable segmentation of cell 808 borders . The resulting segmentation was imported into CellProfiler which was then used to filter 809 out objects below a size threshold , eliminating cell fragments , and cells not expressing mCherry 810 ( used as a fluorescent tag for all Melt constructs quantified ) . From there , segmented cells could 811 be used to quantify total mCh levels in each cell . Additionally , a 1 pixel radius at the edge of the 812 object was assigned as the cell membrane and was used to quantify membrane levels of mCh . 813 814 815 816 Figure S2 . Normalization of meltTEVp proteolysis to account for temperature - dependent 817 changes in protein expression . A ) Total protein expression is elevated at low temperatures as 818 demonstrated by mCh - TEVp expression . Cells were cultured at the indicated temperature for 24 819 hours . B ) To account for changes in FlipGFP signals caused by temperature dependent 820 expression differences , negative control ( no TEVp ) and positive control ( constitutively 821 membrane bound TEVp - CAAX ) cells were used to establish minimal and maximal FlipGFP 822 signals at each temperature . C ) Minimal and maximal cutting ranges at each temperature were 823 used to normalize meltTEVp and TEVp proteolysis to the ranges established in ( B ) ( subtracting 824 minimum signal and dividing by maximum ) . This normalization was performed to account for 825 changes in protein expression levels that could account for increases in proteolysis at low 826 temperatures .

See 891 Methods for FlipGFP quantification workflow . 892 893 894 895 896 Figure S9 . Quantification of cell area to assess effects of meltITSN1 - 37 . A cell expressing 897 meltITSN1 - 37 was imaged and subsequently thresholded in ImageJ such that cell positive 898 pixels were set to 1 and background pixels were set to 0 . A region of interest containing the cell 899 of interest was drawn by hand . Summing the total number of positive pixels in the cell region 900 was therefore used as a metric of total cell area . 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 Figure S10 . Lack of thermal stress observed below 42°C . To examine whether the 926 temperature changes required for Melt - 37 / 40 activation would also apply thermal stress to 927 mammalian cells , we measured stress granule ( SG ) formation as well as changes in proliferation 928 in response to thermal stimuli used throughout the manuscript . A ) SGs were visualized by 929 immunofluorescence for G3BP1 . No SGs were seen in HEK293T cells in normal growth 930 conditions , while bright SG puncta were seen in cells treated with 100 µM sodium arsenite for 3 931 hours prior to fixation ( positive control ) . B ) SGs were visualized in HEK293Ts that were exposed 932 to various durations and intensities of heating . No SGs were observed in cells heated to < 41°C , 933 and only a few cells showed SGs when heated to 42°C . By contrast , heating to 43°C induced 934 SGs in nearly all cells within 30 min , followed by detachment of cells at later time points . C ) To 935 examine integration of potential heat stress over longer time periods , we measured cell 936 proliferation . D ) Staining for phospho - Rb ( pRb ) indicates whether a cell is in G1 ( pRb - ) or in later 937 stages of the cell cycle ( pRb + ) . Red line in density plots separates the two populations . HEK293T 938 cells starved for 24 hr ( top plot ) show a larger fraction of cells in G1 compared to cells kept in full 939 medium ( second from top ) . Cells cultured in full medium for 24 hr at temperatures between 38 - 940 42°C show the same fraction of pRb + cells as cells cultured at 37°C , indicating no stress - induced 941 impairment of proliferation . E ) Quantification of pRb + cells after the indicated times and 942 temperatures of heating . Each data point represents the mean + / - SD of three wells . F ) 943 Quantification of total cell counts from experiment in ( D , E ) . The lack of difference in cell counts at 944 different temperatures demonstrates a lack of changes in proliferation or cell death due to heat 945 stimulation at or below 42°C .
