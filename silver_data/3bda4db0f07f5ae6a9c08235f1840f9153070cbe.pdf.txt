Individual cells of different lineages 11 maintain a distinctly unique average cytoplasmic MMC for considerably long durations . 12 Despite diffusion , actin cytoskeleton facilitates spatially heterogeneous MMC in the 13 cytoplasm . While hypertonic - stress triggers regulatory volume increase ( RVI ) , other 14 methods of increasing cytoplasmic MMC fail to start RVI , suggesting that cells lack 15 capabilities for MMC homeostasis . During spreading or microtubule - depolymerized 16 state , cells neglect changes in cytoplasmic MMC to undergo volume regulation . 17 Inhibition of TNFR1 increases the membrane tension and deprives cells of their ability 18 to undergo volume regulation . Current understanding contemplates that cytoplasmic 19 MMC , the mechanical state of the plasma membrane or the actin cytoskeleton , could 20 be sensors for cell volume regulation . Our observations establish the irrelevance of 21 cytoplasmic MMC and the significance of plasma membrane tension in setting off the 22 cell volume regulation machinery . 23 24 Introduction : 25 The cytoplasm and the lumen of many organelles contain different macromolecules in 26 remarkably high densities . Cytoplasmic protein densities may range from 50 - 400 mg / mL , 27 depending on the cell lineage ( Fulton , 1982 ; Cayley et al . , 1991 ) . Cytoplasmic macromolecules 28 primarily comprise proteins ( 56 % ) , nucleic acids ( 23 % ) , lipids ( 9 % ) , polysaccharides ( 3 % ) 29 ( Kohata and Miyoshi , 2020 ) . Consequently , the fraction of excluded volume of the 30 macromolecules becomes notable compared to the total volume of the cytoplasm . This 31 entropic effect is also described as the thermodynamic state of macromolecular crowding 32 ( MMC ) ( Minton , 1981 ; Ellis , 2001 ) , which affects a host of physicochemical processes in the 33 cytoplasm such as diffusion ( Rashid et al . , 2015 ) , active transport ( Nettesheim et al . , 2020 ) , 34 protein - ligand binding kinetics ( Minton , 2001 ; Köhn et al . , 2021 ) , enzyme - substrate reaction 35 rates ( Thoke , Bagatolli and Olsen , 2018 ; Wilcox , Chung and Slade , 2021 ) , macromolecular self - 36 assembly ( André and Spruijt , 2020 ; Schreck , Bridstrup and Yuan , 2020 ) , protein folding ( Ådén and 37 Wittung - Stafshede , 2014 ) and post - translational modifications ( Darling and Uversky , 2018 ) , to 38 name a few . Consequently , it led to a hypothesis that cells may regulate their cytoplasm MMC 39 to control biochemical processes . Despite the high relevance of cytoplasmic MMC , the 40 literature lacks experimental study on cellular ability for homeostasis of cytoplasmic MMC ( Lin 41 and Amir , 2018 ) . Thus , more information is needed concerning the temporal dynamics and 42 population heterogeneity of cytoplasmic MMC in eukaryotic cells . Cytoplasmic MMC and cell 43 volume are inversely related ; therefore , MMC is hypothesized to be the thermodynamic 44 condition that cell volume regulation machinery utilizes as a volume sensor ( Minton , Colclasure 45 and Parker , 1992 ; Burg , 2000 ; Al - Habori , 2001 ) . However , other factors , such as the mechanical 46 state of the plasma membrane , can alternatively act as sensors for cell volume regulation 47 ( Strange , 2004 ; Hoffmann , Lambert and Pedersen , 2009 ; Gonzalez et al . , 2018 ; Adar and Safran , 2020 ) . 48 Some of the critical factors that alter MMC in the cytoplasm are translation , degradation of 49 proteins , and cytoskeleton disassembly . It is unclear whether or not cells tightly maintain MMC 50 in its cytoplasm for relatively long durations . Thus , the investigation of cytoplasmic MMC is 51 valuable and requires a reliable tool for its dynamic characterization in living cells . 52 In this manuscript , we establish that steady state Fluorescence Anisotropy of EGFP ( 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ) is 53 a reliable indicator of cytoplasmic MMC , with a high dynamic range virtually insensitive to 54 variations in intracellular pH , salt concentration , small - molecule concentration , and exhibit 55 reversibility . Using 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) , we investigate i ) spatiotemporal dynamics and ii ) the ability of the 56 cells to enforce the homeostasis of cytoplasmic MMC at the cellular level , and also explore 57 the link between MMC and cell volume regulation . 58 Results and discussion 59 EGFP as a sensor for Macromolecular Crowding 60 We study the effect of macromolecular crowder concentrations on the fluorescence anisotropy 61 of EGFP ( 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ) ( Fig 1A ) . The value of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) rises linearly with increasing concentrations of 62 BSA in the mM range . Polysucrose , small organic molecules , and salts induce sufficient 63 change in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) only at a very high , non - physiological concentration range ( Fig 1B ) . According 64 to the Perrin equation : 𝑟 = 𝑟 (cid:2868) ( 1 + 𝜏 𝜃 (cid:3004) ) ⁄ ⁄ , w here , 𝜃 (cid:3004) = 𝜂𝑉 𝑘 (cid:3003) 𝑇 ⁄ , the observed change in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) , 65 can be explained by the effect of MMC on fluorophore lifetime ( 𝜏 ) , solution viscosity ( 𝜂 ) , and 66 intrinsic anisotropy ( 𝑟 (cid:2868) ) . Increasing MMC increases both the solution viscosity 𝜂 ( Rashid et al . , 67 2015 ) and the refractive index ' 𝑛 ' , leading to a decrease in 𝜏 , according to the Strickler - Berg 68 equation ( 1 𝜏 ⁄ ∝ 𝑛 (cid:2870) ) ( Strickler and Berg , 1962 ) . The rotational correlation time ( 𝜃 (cid:3004) ) of EGFP 69 in PBS (  14ns ) ( Novikov et al . , 2017 ) is significantly longer than its 𝜏 (  2 . 6ns ) ( Fig S1 ) , hence 70 further increase in 𝜂 is expected to cause a negligible change in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ( Suhling , Davis and Phillips , 71 2002 ; Suhling et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , we conclude that the observed increase in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ( Fig 1A , 72 Fig 1B ) in crowded solutions is caused mainly by the reduction in 𝜏 ( Fig 1C ) and increase in 73 𝑟 (cid:2868) ( Fig S1B ) . To establish this , we compare the fluorescence anisotropy measurement of 74 EGFP ( 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ) with that of fluorescein ( 𝑟 (cid:3007)(cid:3013)(cid:3019)(cid:3020)(cid:3004)(cid:3015) ) in 80 - 90 % glycerol solutions where 75 fluorescein ' s 𝜃 (cid:3004) is comparable to its 𝜏 ( Devauges et al . , 2012 ) . For these solutions , viscosity ( 𝜂 ) 76 increases significantly by 264 % , whereas the refractive index ( 𝑛 ) changes by a minuscule 77 amount ( 1 % ) ( CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics , 85th Edition - Google Books , no date , pp . 8 – 78 66 ) . The shape of the 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) and 𝑟 (cid:3007)(cid:3013)(cid:3019)(cid:3020)(cid:3004)(cid:3015) plots in Fig 1D establish that increase of solution 𝜂 79 has a negligible effect on 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) . To verify the reliability of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) as an indicator of MMC in the 80 cell cytoplasm , we further explore its dependence on pH and EGFP concentration . Fig 1E 81 establishes that 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) is independent of variations in its own concentration , and Fig 1F shows 82 that 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) is independent of pH at the physiological range . Therefore , cell to cell variations in 83 EGFP expression level , cytosolic pH , salt concentrations , or the small molecule crowder 84 concentrations will not alter the measured 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) , making it a reliable indicator of cytoplasmic 85 MMC . 86 87 Cells’ ability to enforce RVI is cell lineage dependent 88 We directly probe the efficacy of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) as a sensor for cytoplasmic MMC in cells of multiple 89 lineages . Hypertonic shock induces rapid water efflux from cells , thus increasing the cytosolic 90 MMC ( Ho , 2006 ; Petelenz - Kurdziel et al . , 2011 ; Miermont et al . , 2013 ) . On exposing EGFP 91 expressing NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts ( NIH / 3T3 - EGFP ) to dextrose supplemented hypertonic 92 condition ( 950mOsm ) , the value of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) rises , as shown in Fig 2A . Time - lapse measurement 93 of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ( Fig S2A ) establishes that the cytoplasmic MMC in NIH / 3T3 - EGFP cells increases 94 rapidly within 80 seconds in hypertonic conditions . Subsequently , the cells maintain the 95 increased cytosolic MMC for at least up to 2 hours ( Fig 2B ) . As expected , hypotonic shock 96 ( ~ 170mOsm ) reduces the cytoplasmic MMC ( Fig 2C , S2B ) . However , cells can counteract the 97 effect of hypotonic shock within 2 hours through regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) , as evident 98 from the 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) and cell spread area trajectory ( Fig 2C , S2B ) ( Roffay et al . , 2021 ) . The observed 99 increase of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) due to increased cytoplasmic MMC is caused primarily by the decrement of 100 its fluorescence lifetime , 𝜏 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ( Fig 2D , S2C ) ( Suhling et al . , 2002 ) . While 950mOsm hypertonic 101 shock with dextrose causes about a 20 % increase in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) , without recovery ( Fig 2B ) , 102 950mOsm shock with NaCl causes a smaller change ( ~ 10 % ) in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ( Fig S2D ) , because the 103 rapid exchange of Cl - and Na + ions can alleviate the adverse effects of excessive osmotic 104 imbalance ( Vallés et al . , 2015 ; Serra et al . , 2021 ) . Reversing the osmotic imbalance ( 950mOsm ) 105 with isotonic DMEM causes immediate reversal of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) to pre - shock value ( Fig 2E ) . Thus , 106 the MMC sensing property of EGFP exhibits reversibility . Further exposing NIH / 3T3 - EGFP to 107 varying degrees of osmotic imbalances causes a gradually larger increase in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ( Fig 2F ) . 108 These observations suggest that measurement of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) permits fast , precise monitoring of a 109 significantly large degree of changes in the cytoplasmic MMC . The rise in MMC due to 110 hypertonic imbalance is either maintained ( for  550mOsm ) or is gradually restored to ( for 111  500mOsm ) within 30 minutes of hypertonic shock via regulatory volume increase ( RVI ) ( Jalihal 112 et al . , 2020 ) . Since EGFP localizes both in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm , we investigate 113 the impact of enhanced cytoplasmic MMC on the mobility of cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic 114 proteins using FRAP . Fig S2E indicates that gradually higher degrees of hypertonicity , 115 decrease the mobility of EGFP monotonically in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm . As 116 expected , hypertonic shock with a non - metabolizable analog of dextrose , mannitol , has an 117 identical impact on NIH / 3T3 cells ( Fig S2F ) . Our studies indicate that different cell lineages , 118 such as RAW 264 . 7 , HeLa , and MDA - MB - 231 , maintain a different level of average 119 cytoplasmic MMC ( Fig S2H ) . Investigation of RVI establishes cell - type dependent response 120 to identical hypertonic shock ( Fig 2G - i , ii ) . Interestingly , RAW 264 . 7 macrophages exhibit an 121 approximate rise of 14 % and 17 % in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) within 10 minutes exposed to 400mOsm ( Fig 2G - 122 i , Fig S2G - i ) or 500mOsm ( Fig 2G - ii , Fig S2G - ii ) dextrose , respectively . It is a significantly 123 larger change than observed in NIH / 3T3 cells ( ~ 2 % and ~ 6 % , respectively ) . Further , unlike 124 NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts , RAW 264 . 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells fail to restore the effect of osmotic 125 imbalance endogenously during 30 minutes time intervals . However , the response of HeLa 126 cells to hypertonic shock is comparable to that of the NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts ( Fig 2G - i , ii ) . The 127 osmotic imbalance causes changes in cytoplasmic MMC via fast efflux / influx of water . We 128 employ other methods that perturb the cytoplasmic MMC without inducing quick water 129 exchange - ( i ) by treating cells with Heclin , an inhibitor of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase ( Mund et 130 al . , 2014 ) , to reduce protein degradation , thereby increasing cytosolic protein concentration , 131 ( ii ) by using Cycloheximide to inhibit protein translation ( Siegel and Sisler , 1963 ) , thus reducing 132 cytosolic protein concentration , and ( iii ) exposing cells to heat shock , causing widespread 133 cytoplasmic protein degradation ( Parag , Raboy and Kulka , 1987 ) . Cells incubated with Heclin 134 show a significant rise in cytoplasmic MMC , whereas Cycloheximide treatment causes a small 135 but significant reduction of cytoplasmic MMC . Heat shock causes a considerable decrease in 136 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) values ( Fig 2H ) . Using Bradford assay , we independently validate Fig 2H by estimating 137 total protein mass per cell in response to Heclin , Cycloheximide , and heat shock ( Fig 2H , 138 inset ) . To understand whether the higher cytoplasmic MMC in RAW 264 . 7 cells ( Fig S2H ) 139 disarm them of their ability to undergo RVI ( Fig 2G ) , we expose NIH / 3T3 - EGFP cells pre - 140 treated with Heclin to 500mOsm hypertonic shock . Increasing MMC in NIH / 3T3 - EGFP cells 141 does not deprive it of its ability for RVI ( Fig S2I ) , suggesting the ability of the cells to enforce 142 RVI is independent of its cytoplasmic MMC and inherent to its cell type . 143 144 Actin filaments facilitate spatially heterogeneous MMC in the cytoplasm 145 The representative 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) images of NIH / 3T3 - EGFP in isotonic conditions ( Fig 3A ) establishes 146 that the cytoplasmic MMC is non - uniform at a few microns ' length scales . In a significant 147 fraction of different cell lineages , namely , Hela ( ~ 54 % ) , NIH / 3T3 ( ~ 23 % ) , RAW 264 . 7 ( ~ 16 % ) , 148 and MDA - MB - 231 ( ~ 14 % ) , the level of nucleoplasmic MMC is higher than the neighbouring 149 perinuclear cytoplasm . Additionally , the cortical regions have lower levels of cytoplasmic MMC 150 than the perinuclear regions of the cytoplasm . Further , Fig 3A establishes that the MMC in 151 the lamellipodial region is lower than the rest of the cell body , suggesting differential MMC 152 levels within the cytoplasm . Time - lapse investigation of cells that generate new lamellipodial 153 extensions further establishes that the MMC in newly developed lamellipodial cytoplasm is 154 lower than the rest of the cell body ( Sup . Vid . 1 ) , which confirms previous rheology 155 measurements ( Laurent et al . , 2005 ) . In regions where the thickness of cells is comparable to 156 the Z - resolution of the microscope , the cells show lower 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) values . Therefore , in addition 157 to lifetime imaging ( Fig S2C ) , we validate the differential cytoplasmic MMC in the lamellipodial 158 and the perinuclear cytoplasm independently by alternate methods . Using FRAP , we compare 159 the translational diffusion rate of EGFP in lamellipodial and the perinuclear cytoplasm ( Fig 3B - 160 i ) . Higher MMC leads to an increase of solution viscosity ( Rashid et al . , 2015 ) ; however , the 161 FRAP results in Fig 3B - i exhibit an indiscernible difference in the viscosities of the 162 lamellipodial ( η = 4 . 2±1 . 1cP ) and perinuclear ( η = 4 . 8±1 . 6cP ) cytoplasm . We conclude that the 163 changes in the bulk viscosity caused by an alteration in MMC are probe - size dependent and 164 cannot be measured with a probe whose size is comparable to or smaller than the crowder 165 molecules ( Fabry et al . , 2001 ; Wong et al . , 2004 ) . We verify this in vitro by measuring the viscosity 166 of protein solutions ( BSA : 0mM , 2 . 26mM , and 4 . 52mM ) with two different methods . Estimation 167 of solution viscosity with FRAP of EGFP ( size of EGFP is comparable to BSA ) gives 168 η = 2 . 73±1 . 1cP for BSA free Hepes buffer , η = 3 . 37±1 . 32cP for 2 . 26mM BSA , and 169 η = 3 . 51±3 . 64cP for 4 . 52mM BSA at 20 ℃ ( Fig S3A - i ) . However , estimation of solution viscosity 170 using single particle tracking method with a probe bigger than the crowder molecules , i . e . , 171 200nm fluorescent microspheres ( Fig S3A - ii ) , provides 1 . 48±2 . 72cP for Hepes buffer ( 0mM 172 BSA ) , 3 . 09±5 . 41cP for BSA 2 . 26mM , and 26 . 02±4 . 07cP for BSA 4 . 56mM at 20 ℃ , which are 173 significantly different from the FRAP measurements , and agrees with reported bulk viscosity 174 measurements ( Yadav , Shire and Kalonia , 2011 ) . It establishes that a 30 % ( w / v ) increase in 175 MMC using BSA affects the translational thermal motion ( Mean Squared Displacement or 176 MSD ) of probe EGFP molecules by only 22 % ; as a result , only a small change in solution 177 viscosity is observed by FRAP ( Fig S3A - i ) . However , a similar increase in MMC using BSA 178 reduces the translational thermal motion of bigger - sized probe particles by 94 % , as observed 179 by single particle tracking ( Fig S3A - ii ) . The comparison of MSD of 200nm probe particles 180 reveals that the lamellipodial cytoplasm has a lower crowding ( 𝜂 = 2 . 22±1 . 63cP ) in comparison 181 to the perinuclear cytoplasm ( 𝜂 = 18 . 56±15 . 82cP ) ( Fig 3B - ii ) . Interestingly , the sharp boundary 182 that separates the low MMC cytoplasmic region at the cortex from the rest of the cytoplasm is 183 often associated with actin filaments ( shown by the arrows in Fig 3C ) . Thus , we hypothesize 184 that the actin stress fibers are crucial in maintaining the sharp difference in cytoplasmic MMC 185 ( Fig 3C ) . Disruption of actin filaments in cells leads to homogenization of the cytoplasmic MMC 186 ( Fig S3B - i ) , establishing the importance of actin fibers in maintaining the boundary . Disruption 187 of microtubules and the intermediate filament vimentin leads to an insignificant change in the 188 spatial distribution of cytoplasmic MMC ( Fig S3B - ii , iii ) . Disassembly of actin leads to a 189 significant rise in average cytoplasmic MMC compared to disassembly of microtubules and 190 vimentin ( Fig 3D ) . It is probably because disassembly of F - actin generates a significantly 191 larger concentration of corresponding actin monomers compared to microtubules and 192 intermediate filaments ( Liebermeister et al . , 2014 ; Pegoraro , Janmey and Weitz , 2017 ; Loiodice et al . , 193 2019 ) . Having established the non - uniformity in cytoplasmic MMC distribution , we investigate 194 whether hypertonic conditions cause a spatially uniform rise of cytoplasmic MMC ( Fig 3E ) . 195 Interestingly , water expulsion in response to hypertonic shock is non - uniform at the cortex , 196 compared to the perinuclear regions . The lamellipodial edges exhibit a higher amount of water 197 expulsion than the rest of the cell boundaries . This observation agrees with our claim that 198 lamellipodia have lower MMC than the rest of the cytoplasm ; as a result , it expels more water , 199 leading to a larger increase in cytoplasmic MMC . Additionally , the literature suggests that 200 lamellipodia have more aquaporins , and thus can expel more water than non - lamellipodial 201 edges of the cells ( Karlsson et al . , 2013 ; Papadopoulos and Saadoun , 2015 ; Direito et al . , 2016 ) . 202 203 Hypertonic stress - induced non - specific protein aggregation in the cytoplasm is 204 independent of the increase in MMC . 205 The macromolecular concentration in the cytoplasm should be inversely proportional to its 206 volume if the number of macromolecules remains unchanged . Thus , we investigate the 207 dependence of cytoplasmic 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) on the cell volume in different hypertonic solutions ( Fig 4A ) . 208 However , the shape of the measured 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) vs cell volume ( 𝑉 ) curve in Fig 4A is different from 209 the expected relation : ( 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) = (cid:3023) (cid:3117) (cid:3023) (cid:3435)𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) , (cid:2869) − 𝛼(cid:3439) + 𝛼 ) . It suggests that , in addition to volume 210 change , other cellular processes may alter 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) in response to the hypertonic condition . The 211 shape of the curve in Fig 4A suggests that there is either an increase in the total number of 212 cytoplasmic macromolecular crowders or a change in the effective crowder size . However , 213 measurement of protein mass per cell ( Fig 4B ) establishes that there is no measurable 214 increase in the amount of cytosolic protein content in response to hypertonic shock . Thus , we 215 explore other possibilities like the reorganization of the cytoplasmic macromolecular crowders 216 in response to hypertonic shock that changes the effective crowder size , causing a further rise 217 of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) in Fig 4A ( indicated by the arrow ) . We mimic the reorganization of proteins in the cell 218 cytoplasm by fixing NIH / 3T3 - EGFP with 4 % para - formaldehyde . Fixation causes covalent 219 links between neighbouring protein molecules , increasing the effective crowder size around 220 EGFP molecules . Fig 4C compares the cytoplasmic 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) of cells before and after fixation , 221 establishing that increase in the effective crowder size is an additional factor that can increase 222 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) along with the change in cell volume . Super - resolution imaging of cytoplasmic EGFP in 223 cells exposed to different hypertonic strengths confirms protein aggregation in the cytoplasm 224 ( Fig 4D ) . However , other methods of increasing cytoplasmic MMC ( Heclin treatment , Fig 2H ) 225 do not lead to noticeable protein aggregation ( Fig 4E ) . Literature also suggests that multivalent 226 proteins form larger aggregates in response to increased MMC via self - condensation ( Shin and 227 Brangwynne , 2017 ; Watanabe et al . , 2018 ; Jalihal et al . , 2020 , 2021 ; Keber et al . , 2021 ) . While free 228 EGFP depicts a non - specific weaker aggregation in the cytoplasm , NFκβ , a protein with DNA 229 binding domain ( Yan et al . , 2012 ; Smith et al . , 2019 ; Vonderach et al . , 2019 ) , shows globular self - 230 aggregation in response to hypertonic shock in NIH / 3T3 cells expressing p65 - EGFP , a subunit 231 of the NFκβ complex ( Fig S4A - i ) . However , in Heclin treated NIH / 3T3 , NFκβ shows drastically 232 massive , irregularly shaped aggregates ( Fig S4A - ii ) compared to the globular condensates 233 from hypertonic shock . According to previous reports ( Irianto et al . , 2013 ) , hypertonic conditions 234 cause DNA condensation in the nucleus ( Fig S4B - i ) . However , Heclin mediated increase of 235 cytoplasmic MMC has a non - measurable impact on chromatin condensation ( Fig S4B - ii ) . 236 Therefore , we conclude that the cytoplasmic MMC is not responsible for the condensation of 237 chromatin . 238 239 Cell spreading activates RVI 240 We observe a weak negative correlation ( r = - 0 . 386 ) between the spread area and the 241 corresponding cytoplasmic MMC ( 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) ) in NIH / 3T3 - EGFP ( Fig 5A ) . It suggests a positive 242 correlation between the volume of the cytoplasm ( 𝑉 ) and the cells ' spread area ( 𝐴 ) . The spread 243 area of NIH / 3T3 exhibits a positive , linear correlation ( r = 0 . 909 ) to the cell volume ; 𝑉 = 4 . 2𝐴 + 244 86 . 8 ( Fig 5B - i ) . This correlation could arise either from the cell cycle or from the extent of cell 245 spreading independent of its cell cycle stage . To resolve this , we explore the dynamics of 246 cytoplasmic MMC during cell spreading in NIH / 3T3 - EGFP . 247 Interestingly , the area and volume in the population of spreading cells also exhibit a positive 248 correlation ( r = 0 . 818 ) . However , the 𝑉 − 𝐴 relation in spreading cells shows a slightly different 249 slope : 𝑉 = 2 . 5𝐴 + 963 . 4 ( Fig 5B - ii ) . It suggests that cell spreading dictates the spread area - 250 MMC correlation in ( Fig 5A ) in NIH / 3T3 - EGFP . If cytoplasmic MMC were to be a sensor for 251 cell volume regulation , cells must regulate their volume to maintain the MMC during cell 252 spreading . On the contrary , we find that despite no change in the extracellular tonicity , the 253 average cell volume increases , leading to a decrease in cytoplasmic MMC during cell 254 spreading ( Fig 5C , Fig S5A ) . There is a change in both cell volume and the cytoplasmic MMC 255 in these time scales . This observation cannot establish whether the cells readjust their volume 256 to regulate the cytosolic MMC or if the cell volume changes are indifferent to MMC changes . 257 If the volume regulation is triggered to control MMC , then MMC must act as a sensor for 258 volume regulation . To resolve this , we investigate the cytoplasmic MMC in cells seeded on 259 surfaces that either promote ( Fibronectin ) or inhibit ( 10 % PEG ) cell spreading . Even after 2 260 hours of seeding , the cytoplasmic MMC in cells with compromised spreading is significantly 261 higher than the well - spread cells ( Fig 5D , S5B ) , establishing that cytoplasmic MMC does not 262 trigger volume regulation in spreading cells ; instead , the spreading state of the cells is 263 necessary to initiate volume regulation . Cell spreading causes a significant decrease in the 264 cytoplasmic MMC , causing a 5 . 4 % change in cytoplasmic viscosity ( η = 4 . 87±1 . 15cP for cells 265 on Fibronectin , η = 7 . 5±2 . 06cP for cells on 10 % PEG ) ( Fig 5E ) . In the reverse case of cell area 266 contraction experiments , performed by exposing NIH / 3T3 - EGFP to Trypsin / EDTA , we 267 observe insignificant change in the cell volume between the spread state or 30min after 268 trypsinization . ( Fig 5F , S5C ) , suggesting that contraction of cell spread area within few 269 minutes , do not maintain the same 𝑉 − 𝐴 relation as in Fig 5B . Yet , we find measurable 270 increase in cytoplasmic MMC during contraction , because of the disruption of cytoskeletal 271 filaments to monomers , as we observe for actin ( Fig 5G , S5D ) , and according to previous 272 reports for microtubules ( Celik et al . , 2013 ) . To test this , we first disassemble the actin filaments 273 using Cytochalasin D and then initiate contraction by trypsin treatment in NIH / 3T3 - EGFP . 274 Expectedly , the increase in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) upon trypsinization is significantly less in Cytochalasin D 275 treated cells when compared to control NIH / 3T3 - EGFP ( Fig 5H ) . 276 277 Plasma membrane tension acts as a sensor for cell volume regulatory apparatus 278 Cell volume regulatory apparatus can be broken down into three parts ( i ) cell volume sensor 279 ( ii ) intracellular signaling cascades , which receives information related to change in volume 280 and ( iii ) the volume regulatory action , leading to resetting of cell volume to a set - point . 281 Regulatory volume change during osmotic imbalance involves the exchange of organic and 282 inorganic osmolytes ( Jentsch , 2016 ; Serra et al . , 2021 ) , which are smaller in size than the 283 macromolecular crowders . Thus , there can be two possibly distinct features that could act as 284 a volume sensor . 1 ) chemical signal , i . e . , change in cytoplasmic MMC that alters the 285 thermodynamic activity of the cytoplasm via excluded volume effect , and 2 ) mechanical signal , 286 i . e . , change in the mechanical properties of the membrane / cytoskeleton that alters the 287 intracellular levels of osmolyte for enforcing regulatory volume change . ( Dunham , 1995 ) 288 proposed that the altered cytoplasmic MMC in hypertonic conditions acts as a sensor for 289 volume regulation in RBC cells , suggesting that the changes in the thermodynamic activity of 290 the cytoplasm are the sensor for volume regulation . These studies do not rule out the 291 possibility that altered smaller - sized osmolyte level itself , which has a negligible effect on the 292 thermodynamic activity , could be the sensor for cellular volume regulation during RVI . To 293 identify whether cytoplasmic MMC acts as a volume sensor for the cell , we performed 294 experiments that changed the cytoplasmic MMC without altering the levels of intracellular 295 smaller - sized osmolytes . Hypertonic conditions involve the exchange of osmolytes ( Roffay et 296 al . , 2021 ) and non - specific aggregation of proteins ( Fig 4 ) . As a result , the clustering of 297 cytoplasmic proteins causes the 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) to rise above the expected curve ( dotted line ) ( Fig 6A ) . 298 Since Heclin treatment leads to an increase in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) , whereas treatment of Cycloheximide or 299 heat shock causes a decrement ( Fig 2H ) , we investigated if the changes in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) in these 300 conditions is due to a change in crowder concentration or protein clustering . Fig 4E suggests 301 no apparent clustering of cytoplasmic proteins in response to Heclin treatment . Thus , we 302 conclude that Heclin treatment leads to a rise in cytoplasmic MMC . Next , we investigate 303 whether the increase in cytoplasmic MMC in Heclin treated cells triggers RVI . Fig 6B 304 establishes that there is no noticeable change in cell volume in response to increased ( Heclin ) 305 or decreased ( Cycloheximide ) cytoplasmic MMC , demonstrating that changes in MMC in NIH 306 fibroblast cells do not trigger RVI / RVD even until 4 hours of treatment . The cytoskeleton is the 307 crucial component of the cell that decides its shape . We investigate its role in determining cell 308 volume and cytoplasmic MMC . Disassembly of actin causes no noticeable change in cell 309 volume ; however , the cytoplasmic MMC increases ( Fig 6C , Fig 3D ) . The rise in cytoplasmic 310 MMC is not inversely proportional to the associated volume change because disruption of 311 actin filaments leads to a significant increase in macromolecular crowder in the form of 312 monomeric G - actin ( Fig 6C , dotted line ) . This further indicates that change in cytoplasmic 313 MMC caused by disassembly of actin filaments does not trigger RVI to achieve homeostasis 314 of MMC . Interestingly , the disassembly of microtubules causes an increase in cell volume ( Fig 315 6C ) . The associated change in MMC is inversely proportional to the volume change , indicating 316 that Nocodazole treatment causes a change in cytoplasmic volume , and cells ignore the 317 associated change in MMC . Cell volume changes simultaneously perturb plasma membrane 318 organization ( Roffay et al . , 2021 ) . To investigate the role of the plasma membrane behind cell 319 volume regulation , we postulate the involvement of TNFR1 ( Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor 320 1 ) , as it is reported to exhibit enhanced clustering and internalization during hypertonic stress 321 ( Rosette and Karin , 1996 ) . TNFR1 is also known to localize in membrane caveolae ( D’Alessio 322 et al . , 2010 ; Bae et al . , 2019 ) , and caveolae are the excess membrane folds responsible for 323 mitigating membrane tension imbalances ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ; Roffay et al . , 2021 ) . Moreover , 324 TNFR1 is upstream of NFκβ , which shows enhanced activity during hypertonic stress after 3 - 325 5h of stress induction ( Roth et al . , 2010 ; Farabaugh et al . , 2020 ) . Zafirlukast , a cysteinyl 326 leukotriene antagonist ( Zhou et al . , 2019 ) , is reported to inhibit TNFR1 clustering ( Weinelt et al . , 327 2021 ) . Zafirlukast treatment abrogates RVI in NIH / 3T3 in response to a hypertonic shock of 328 500mOsm ( Fig 6D ) . In addition , Zafirlukast treatment leads to arrest of cell volume regulatory 329 activity during spreading ( Fig 6E - F ) and microtubule depolymerized state ( Fig 6G ) . To 330 understand the effect of Zafirlukast treatment on the plasma membrane , we compare the 331 membrane - fluctuation tension of control cells with that of Zafirlukast treated using interference 332 reflection microscopy ( IRM ) ( Fig 6H ) ( Biswas , Alex , and Sinha , 2017 ) . Membrane fluctuation - 333 tension closely follows membrane frame tension for an extensive range of tension values 334 ( Shiba , Noguchi , and Fournier , 2016 ) . Fig 6H - J establishes that Zafirlukast treatment causes 335 a rise in membrane tension . The amplitude of temporal fluctuations is decreased in cells 336 treated with Zafirlukast ( Fig 6I ) . Thus , increased membrane tension ( Fig 6J ) deprives the cells 337 of their ability to trigger regulatory volume change in hypertonic , spreading , and microtubule 338 depolymerized states . 339 340 Conclusion 341 Measurement of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) in the cytoplasm and solutions of different BSA concentrations establish 342 that 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) is a reliable indicator of macromolecular crowding in cells . MMC lowers 𝜏 and 343 increases 𝑟 (cid:2868) of EGFP giving a linear relation between 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) and the concentration of the 344 macromolecular crowder . We establish that cells of different lineages maintain spatially 345 inhomogeneous and distinctly unique levels of average cytoplasmic MMC . The average 346 cytoplasmic MMC in NIH - 3T3 cells is maintained tightly for a relatively long time ( at least 8h ) 347 if the spread area does not change significantly . Since cell - volume and cytoplasmic MMC are 348 inversely related , measurement of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) and cell volume allows us to explore the relation 349 between cytoplasmic MMC and cell volume regulation . We find that heat - shock , trypsin - 350 induced contraction , treatment of Cytochalasin D , Heclin , or Cycloheximide shifts the MMC in 351 the cytoplasm without any change in cell volume . This observation establishes that the cells 352 lack the ability for homeostasis of cytoplasmic MMC . Though the shift in MMC can alter a host 353 of biochemical processes in the cytoplasm , NIH / 3T3 cells lack the capabilities to regulate it . 354 Imbalance in extracellular osmolarity is known to trigger RVI / RVD . Our manuscript identifies 355 additional conditions not linked to osmolarity shift , such as cell - spreading and microtubule - 356 depolymerized state of the cells in which cells invoke volume change autonomously . In these 357 conditions , cells enforce volume changes , disregarding cytoplasmic MMC changes . Moreover , 358 the volume and MMC are inversely related . Overall , our observations indicate that MMC does 359 not act as a sensor for autonomous volume change by the cells . Next , we identified TNFR1 360 as a vital player required for invoking cell volume regulation . Inactivation of TNFR1 with 361 Zafirlukast abrogates cellular ability for volume regulation . Having ruled out the role of 362 cytoplasmic MMC in cell volume regulation , we studied the plasma membrane ' s mechanical 363 state ( tension ) in control and Zafirlukast treated cells . Zafirlukast treatment causes an increase 364 in membrane tension and abolishes the ability of the cells to regulate their volume . Thus , this 365 manuscript conclusively rules out the role of cytoplasmic MMC in sensing the cell volume . 366 Instead , membrane tension plays a crucial role in activating cell volume regulatory apparatus 367 in NIH / 3T3 cells . 368 Materials and methods 369 370 Cell culture and pharmacological studies 371 NIH / 3T3 cell line was procured from NCCS ( National Center for Cell Science , Pune , India ) . 372 RAW 264 . 7 cell line was a generous gift from Dr . Sanjay Dutta ( CSIR - Indian Institute of 373 Chemical Biology , Kolkata ) , while HeLa and MDA - MB - 231 cell lines were kindly gifted by Dr . 374 Prosenjit Sen ( Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science , Kolkata ) . Fugene® ( Promega ) 375 was used to transfect cells with the following plasmids : pCAG - mGFP , a gift from Connie Cepko 376 ( Addgene plasmid # 14757 ) ; mCherry - Lifeact - 7 , a gift from Michael Davidson ( Addgene 377 plasmid # 54491 ) ; and EGFP - p65 , a gift from Johannes A . Schmid ( Addgene plasmid # 378 111190 ) , following standard protocol . Cells cultured in DMEM ( Himedia , # Al007G ) at 37 ℃ , 5 % 379 CO 2 in a humidified incubator , were seeded on custom - made glass bottom 35mm petridishes . 380 The glass was coated with 50mg / mL Fibronectin ( Sigma , # F1141 ) to promote rapid adhesion 381 and proper spreading , or with 10 % PEG ( Polyethylene glycol 1000 , Sigma # 81189 ) to arrest 382 spreading in the appropriate cases . Before microscopy , cells were gently washed with 1xPBS 383 twice , and culture media was replaced with phenol red - free DMEM ( Gibco , # 21063029 ) , which 384 could be supplemented with the required drug when necessary . For all pharmacological 385 treatments , Cytochalasin D ( Merck , # C8273 ) , Nocodazole ( Merck , # 487928 ) , Withaferin A 386 ( Merck , # W4394 ) , Heclin ( Tocris , # 5433 ) , Cycloheximide ( Sigma , # 18079 ) , and Zafirlukast 387 ( Merck , # Z4152 ) were dissolved in DMSO , and working concentrations were reconstituted as 388 indicated in appropriate places . For applying heat shock , cells were incubated at 42 ℃ for 1h 389 in the presence of 5 % CO 2 . To create osmotic imbalance , cells were first imaged in isotonic 390 complete medium , and then the culture media was replaced with either hypertonic or hypotonic 391 complete medium using a custom - made flow system . Hypertonic media was prepared by 392 adding Dextrose , Mannitol , or NaCl ( Merck Empura ) to phenol red - free DMEM at indicated 393 concentrations and filtered for decontamination . Hypotonic media was prepared by adding 394 autoclaved MiliQ water to phenol red - free DMEM at required amounts to create the desired 395 osmolarity . 396 𝒓 𝑬𝑮𝑭𝑷 measurement 397 Cells seeded on glass - bottom petridishes were imaged with a 40x air immersion objective ( NA 398 0 . 75 ) using the Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 epifluorescence microscope . Light from a mercury arc 399 lamp ( HXP 150 ) was passed through a linear polarizer ( ThorLabs ) to create horizontally 400 polarized light . The resulting polarized fluorescence signal from the cells passes through a 401 polarizing beam splitter ( DV2 , Photometrics ) to divide the emission light into parallel and 402 perpendicular polarizations . The light is then collected by a CMOS camera ( Hamamatsu Orca 403 Flash 4 . 0 C13440 ) , and the polarized fluorescence signal appears as an image having 404 2048x2048 pixels , with each half ( 1024x2048 pixels ) representing the parallel and 405 perpendicularly polarized emission , respectively . Due to misalignment in the optical path , the 406 two halves don’t completely overlap . To resolve this , fluorescent polystyrene microspheres of 407 200nm diameter are dried on a glass coverslip and imaged in the same arrangement as 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) 408 measurement , such that the images of the beads may serve as fiduciary markers to register 409 the two halves of the image . Using the Descriptor - based Registration plugin of Fiji ( ImageJ ) 410 ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) and a custom Fiji Macro , the left ( perpendicular channel , 𝐼 (cid:2884) ) and right 411 ( parallel channel , 𝐼 ∥ ) half of the 2048x2048 image is registered to create the best possible 412 overlap of the corresponding pixels in both channels . Thence , 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) is calculated for each pixel 413 using the relation : 414 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) = 𝐼 ∥ − 𝑔𝐼 (cid:2884) 𝐼 ∥ + 2𝑔𝐼 (cid:2884) 426 where 𝑔 refers to the G - factor . Images of 100nM fluorescein solution are used to find the G - 415 factor . To correct for background fluorescence , a 2048x2048pixel image of the phenol red - 416 free DMEM , having no cells and illuminated by similar conditions as the experimental subjects , 417 was subtracted from each 2048x2048 image . This process eliminates the background 418 fluorescence of both the parallel and perpendicular channels in the correct ratio . The resultant 419 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) the image was saved as a 32 - bit TIFF image file , thresholded based on intensity ( 15000 - 420 50000 count for 16 - bit image ) , and further analyzed using a custom - written code in Fiji 421 ( ImageJ ) . Statistics of at least 30 cells were collected for each experiment , and their mean 422 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) and standard error of the mean were plotted . Confidence testing was performed with a 423 Two - sample T - test in each case . Stars ( * s ) were assigned based on the general protocol for 424 p - values . 425 Cell volume measurement 427 Cells were imaged using the Zeiss LSM 780 light scanning confocal system using a 63x oil 428 immersion objective . Z - stack images of 0 . 4μm step - size were taken using the AiryScan super - 429 resolution mode to measure the whole cell volume . The whole Z - stack was binarized by an 430 intensity threshold to mark the pixels containing cells as white and the background as black . 431 Then , upon counting the number of white pixels contained in the binary Z - stack and multiplying 432 the resultant with the appropriate voxel dimensions , the volume of the cells was calculated . 433 Statistics of at least 10 cells were collected for plotting . 434 𝒓 𝑬𝑮𝑭𝑷 vs . 𝑽 curve 435 The linear increment of 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) as a function of concentration ( 𝐶 ) can be fitted to a straight line 436 of slope 𝑚 and Y - intercept 𝐵 , which yields 𝐶 = 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) 𝑚(cid:3415) − 𝐵 𝑚(cid:3415) . Thus , the quantity 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) − 𝛼 , 437 where 𝛼 = 𝐵 𝑚(cid:3415) , reflects a scaled measure of concentration . Following the relation 𝐶 (cid:2869) 𝑉 (cid:2869) = 438 𝐶 (cid:2870) 𝑉 (cid:2870) , we get : ( 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) − 𝛼 ) 𝑉 = (cid:3435)𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) , (cid:2869) − 𝛼(cid:3439)𝑉 (cid:2869) , and thus , 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) = (cid:3023) (cid:3117) (cid:3023) (cid:3435)𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) , (cid:2869) − 𝛼(cid:3439) + 𝛼 . 439 Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching ( FRAP ) 440 Using a home - built FRAP setup , photobleaching and recovery were imaged with a 488nm 441 Laser ( Coherent ) through the 63x oil immersion objective of Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 . Briefly , 442 the 0 . 42mW Laser beam was split in a 90 : 10 ratio . The resultant beams were collimated using 443 a lens system to be incident parallelly on the back focal plane of the microscope objective . 444 The beams were aligned to illuminate the same spot ( of 2μm diameter ) when imaged with the 445 63x objective . The low - intensity beam was further dimmed using neutral density filters to 446 minimize photobleaching and image the circular spot . To perform FRAP , the circular spot was 447 continuously imaged at a rate of 50 - 100 frames per second with only the low - intensity beam . 448 After 70 - 100 frames , the high - intensity beam was exposed for 10ms using a programmable 449 shutter ( Thorlabs , SC10 ) to achieve fast photobleaching . Imaging is continued for a total of 450 2000 frames , by which time the intensity of the spot becomes constant , indicating completion 451 of recovery . The fluorophore ' s diffusion rate and mobile fractions are calculated by fitting the 452 intensity recovery data from the spot with a custom - written MATLAB code , as explained in 453 ( Kang et al . , 2010 ) . Before studying live cells , the FRAP setup was calibrated using a glycerol - 454 water mix of known viscosity containing 100nM fluorescein ( data not shown ) . 455 Single Particle Tracking 456 Fluorescent polystyrene beads of diameter 200nm ( Invitrogen , # F8888 ) were imaged with a 457 63x oil immersion objective at a rate of 100 frames per second to capture the thermal motion . 458 For in vitro measurement , beads were suspended in BSA solutions at previously indicated 459 concentrations . The beads were ballistically injected with the Helios Gene Gun ( BioRad ) 460 delivery system for intracellular measurement . Cells were “shot” with a pressure of 100PSI 461 from a distance of 3 - 4cm from the petridish . Cells were gently washed with serum - free media 462 thrice to remove beads stuck on the plasma membrane or glass . Then the cells were incubated 463 in phenol red - free DMEM at 37 ℃ , 5 % CO 2 for 2h to allow them to recuperate . The trajectories 464 of the fluorescent beads were extracted using the Mosaic plugin ( Particle Tracking 2D / 3D ) of 465 ImageJ . The following relation was used for MSD computation of a bead with trajectory ( 𝑥 (cid:3047) , 𝑦 (cid:3047) ) : 466 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ( 𝜏 ) = 〈 ( 𝑥 (cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:3099) − 𝑥 (cid:3047) ) (cid:2870) + ( 𝑦 (cid:3047)(cid:2878)(cid:3099) − 𝑦 (cid:3047) ) (cid:2870) 〉 , where , 𝜏 is the lag - time . MSD computation was 467 performed using a custom - written MATLAB code . 468 Calculation of viscosity ( 𝜼 ) from Diffusion constant ( 𝑫 ) or Mean Squared Displacement 469 ( 𝑴𝑺𝑫 ) 470 The Stoke - Einstein equation : 𝐷 = 𝑘 (cid:3003) 𝑇 6𝜋𝜂𝑟⁄ , where 𝑟 is the Stoke’s radius of the particle of 471 interest , relates 𝐷 with 𝜂 . Using 𝑟 = 4 . 2nm for EGFP , we can calculate 𝜂 for simple diffusion of 472 EGFP . Since 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ( 𝜏 ) = 4𝐷𝜏 ( in 2D ) , we can easily obtain 𝜂 using the Stoke - Einstein relation . 473 Time - resolved fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence lifetime measurements 474 EGFP purified from E . Coli using Ni - NTA chromatography was lyophilized and reconstituted 475 in Hepes ( SRL , # 63732 ) buffer of pH ( 7 . 2 - 7 . 6 ) . The concentration of purified EGFP was 476 estimated from UV absorbance and fluorescence . Subsequently , the reconstituted EGFP was 477 diluted in appropriate solvents in a fixed ratio of 1 : 100 v / v for all experiments ( except 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) vs 478 EGFP concentration ) . Fluorescence lifetime and time - resolved anisotropy decay 479 measurements were done using the DeltaFlex™ system ( Horiba ) using 4 - side transparent UV 480 quartz cuvettes . 481 Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy ( FLIM ) 482 FLIM was carried out using a pico - second 480nm laser ( PicoQuant ) , and fluorescence lifetime 483 data for individual pixels were fitted to mono - exponential decay using the SymPhoTime64 484 software . The resultant 32 - bit TIFF image was analyzed in a similar way as in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) 485 measurements with Fiji ( ImageJ ) ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Cells were seeded on glass - bottom 486 35mm petridishes , and hypertonic stress was applied following the same protocol as in 𝑟 (cid:3006)(cid:3008)(cid:3007)(cid:3017) 487 experiments . Data of 30 cells were used for statistics . 488 Interference Reflection Microscopy 489 An inverted microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) with adjustable field and aperture diaphragms , 490 60x Plan Apo ( NA 1 . 22 , water immersion ) with 1 . 5x external magnification , 100 W mercury 491 arc lamp , ( 546 ± 12 nm ) interference filter , 50 : 50 beam splitter , and CMOS ( ORCA Flash 4 . 0 492 Hamamatsu , Japan ) camera were used for IRM . Fast time - lapse images of cells were taken 493 at 20 frames per second , and a total of 2048 frames were captured . Membrane fluctuations 494 are quantified for regions within ~ 100 nm of the coverslip and termed First Branch Regions 495 ( FBRs ) . Calibration , identification of FBRs , and quantification of fluctuation amplitude ( 𝑆𝐷 (cid:3047)(cid:3036)(cid:3040)(cid:3032) ) 496 and tension were done as previously reported ( Biswas , Alex and Sinha , 2017 ) . 497 Acknowledgements 498 We are grateful to the CSS and TRC confocal facility of the Indian Association for the 499 Cultivation of Science for providing the confocal microscopy and TCSPC system .
