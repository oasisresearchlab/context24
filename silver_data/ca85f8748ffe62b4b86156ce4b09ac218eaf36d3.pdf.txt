New variants of the virus are frequently emerging leading to new waves of infection and re - introduction of control measures . In this study , we assessed the effectiveness of containment strategies implemented in the early phase of the pandemic . Methods Real - world data for COVID - 19 cases was retrieved for the period Jan 1 to May 1 , 2020 from a number of different sources , including PubMed , MEDLINE , Facebook , Epidemic Forecasting and Google Mobility Reports . We analyzed data for 18 countries / regions that deployed containment strategies such as travel restrictions , lockdowns , stay - at - home requests , school / public events closure , social distancing , and exposure history information management ( digital contact tracing , DCT ) . Primary outcome measure was the change in the number of new cases over 30 days before and after deployment of a control measure . We also compared the effectiveness of centralized versus decentralized DCT . Time series data for COVID - 19 were analyzed using Mann - Kendall ( M - K ) trend tests to investigate the impact of these measures on changes in the number of new cases . The rate of change in the number of new cases was compared using M - K z - values and Sen’s slope . Results In spite of the widespread implementation of conventional strategies such as lockdowns , travel restrictions , social distancing , school closures , and stay - at - home requests , analysis revealed that these measures could not prevent the spread of the virus . However , countries which adopted DCT with centralized data storage were more likely to contain the spread . Conclusions Centralized DCT was more effective in containing the spread of COVID - 19 . Early implementation of centralized DCT should be considered in future outbreaks . However , challenges such as public acceptance , data security and privacy concerns will need to be addressed . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Keywords : COVID - 19 ; SARS - CoV - 2 ; containment strategies ; lockdown ; digital contact tracing ; exposure history information management Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic , continues to cause major impact worldwide [ 1 – 3 ] . Nearly 500 million cases and over 6 million deaths have been recorded since the outbreak was first reported in early 2020 [ 4 , 5 ] . The virus continues to evolve , with emergence of new variants , triggering renewed waves of global infection [ 6 – 9 ] . Although mass vaccinations have been rolled out in most countries [ 10 ] , the effectiveness of all the currently approved vaccines has been found to decrease over time [ 11 – 13 ] . Thus , the challenges of containing and controlling this pandemic remains at the forefront . Control measures such as regional lockdowns and quarantine were deployed during the first wave of the pandemic in Wuhan , China [ 14 , 15 ] . Many countries followed suit and adopted travel restrictions and public closures during the early intense phase of the global outbreak [ 16 – 18 ] . These extreme lockdowns were not sustainable however owing to large economic and societal costs [ 1 , 19 ] . Moreover , these measures were not universally effective . For example , containment strategies , such as strict lockdowns which were implemented in countries like China and Singapore in the first wave of the pandemic , were fairly effective in controlling the transmission [ 14 , 20 ] . By contrast , countries such as UK and USA , which implemented mitigating strategies such as social distancing , school closures and national curfews , did not fare well in controlling the transmission [ 20 , 21 ] . Subsequently , digital contact tracing ( DCT ) was piloted in a few countries and subnational regions to track case exposure , vaccination status and test results [ 22 ] . This intervention was reported to be more effective in controlling the spread of the infection [ 22 – 24 ] . However , the relative efficacy of different control measures remains unknown . Public health officials need a comparative analysis of real - world data to make informed policy decisions that have major social and economic consequences . The implementation of these control measures at different times in several countries with reliable case reporting created a natural experiment to study their effect on viral transmission . We aimed to evaluate the relative effectiveness of public health preventive measures on containing viral transmission using real - world data . This has implications for effective J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 control of the current and future pandemics of highly transmissible infectious diseases . Methods Data collection Real - world data was collected for 18 different countries . The full details of the sources and corresponding references are provided in Supplementary eTable 1 . Data was used to compare the effectiveness of public health containment and mitigating measures , namely , social distancing , stay - at - home requests , lockdowns , and schools / events closure . Data were also collected for 15 countries / regions that implemented digital contact tracing ( DCT ) . The full details of the sources and references for DCT is given in Supplementary eTable 2 . The number of new confirmed cases of SARS - CoV - 2 , 30 days before and after the implementation of a control measure were obtained via an extensive international data search ( Supplementary eTable 1 and eTable 2 ) . Data for COVID - 19 cases was retrieved for the period Jan 1 to May 1 , 2020 . Additional data on the enforcement of containment measures were obtained from PubMed , MEDLINE , Facebook , Epidemic Forecasting ( http : / / epidemicforecasting . org / ) , and Google Mobility Reports . Statistical analysis Time series data for COVID - 19 were analyzed using Mann - Kendall ( M - K ) trend tests to investigate the impact of containment measures on changes in the number of new cases , reproductive number ( R ) , and population mobility . M - K and Kolmogorov - Smirnov ( K - S ) tests were used to determine if the number of new cases differed before and after a policy implementation . A positive ( or negative ) z - value indicated that the number of new cases increased ( or decreased ) over time . A containment measure was classified as effective if there was a decreasing trend in the change of new cases ( z < 0 ) or a reduction in the number of new cases ( percentage change < 0 ) after its implementation . Sen’s slope was calculated to estimate the magnitude of the trend . All statistical analyses were conducted using R statistical language ( R Core Team ( 2021 ) . R : A language and environment for statistical computing . R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria . https : / / www . R - project . org / . Version 4 . 0 . 3 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Results We analyzed COVID - 19 data from 18 countries and regions ( mainland China and Hong Kong were analyzed separately ; Supplementary eTable 3 ) . The real - world effectiveness for each of the 6 control strategies varied considerably ( Supplementary eTable 4 ) . This variation in effectiveness is shown in Figure 1 by the change in z - scores 30 - days before and after deployment . COVID - 19 control measures , in order of decreasing effectiveness , included centralized DCT ( change in mean z - scores , - 2 . 2 ) , decentralized DCT ( - 0 . 78 ) , social distancing ( + 0 . 98 ) , stay - at - home requests ( + 1 . 5 ) , lockdowns ( + 1 . 6 ) , and schools / events closure ( + 1 . 7 ) . Thus , it appeared that DCT was associated with a decrease in the transmission of new cases while conventional strategies were relatively ineffective in controlling the spread of the virus . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 Figure 1 . Effectiveness of COVID - 19 containment measures . Negative values indicate a decrease in the number of new cases over 30 days after deployment of containment measure compared to 30 days prior to implementation . Data from the first half of 2020 . Abbreviations : DCT , digital contact tracing . Conventional social measures Daily number of new cases was higher even after the implementation of standard social J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 containment strategies as shown by the standardized number of new cases 30 days before and after implementation ( Supplementary eTable 4 ) . Substantial viral spread could be observed even after lockdowns in all studied countries . A sharp escalation in the number of newly infected cases was observed in the United Kingdom ( slope + 4 , 514 [ SE 43 . 74 ] ) and Germany ( + 4723 [ 109 . 1 ] ) . Relatively smaller increases were seen in South Korea ( + 40 . 86 [ 11 . 58 ] ) and Israel ( + 20 . 11 [ 5 . 95 ] ) after lockdown implementation . Stay - at - home orders also did not retard the increase in the number of new cases ( Figure 1 ) . School and events closures were only partly effective in decreasing the magnitude of the rate of new cases in Japan ( 64 . 8 [ 16 . 41 ] ) and ineffective in other countries , consist with a previous report [ 21 ] . Social - distancing measures also did not perform well . There was some success in South Korea for the first 20 days after implementation of social distancing , but the rates rose sharply afterwards . Digital contact tracing ( DCT ) DCT data were extracted and analyzed for 15 countries / regions from 31 sources ( Supplementary eTable 2 ) . The average adoption rate in the studied countries was 37 . 6 % . As shown in Figure 1 , centralized DCT performed better than decentralized apps ( detailed data are presented in Supplementary eTable 4 ) . Logistic regression showed that countries with centralized DCT ( OR : 0 . 25 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 02 , 2 . 06 ] ) , higher adoption rates ( 1 . 016 [ 0 . 0002 , 1 . 06 ] ) and policy enforcement ( 0 . 63 [ 0 . 06 , 2 . 37 ] ) were more likely to have better control . Policy enforcement in Hong Kong , South Korea , and Singapore included monetary fines upon those who violated DCT reporting guidelines . Figure 2 shows the trends in the number of cases 30 days before and after the DCT implementation . Except Singapore ( + 188 % ) , centralized DCT apps in all studied countries substantially decelerated the spread of the COVID - 19 . The decreases in rates were substantial : Australia ( percent change , - 86 % ) , South Korea ( - 85 % ) , and China ( - 30 % ) . In other countries , the number of new cases showed a decreasing trend after DCT launch ( i . e . , Hong Kong [ z = - 5 . 5 ] and Japan [ z = - 6 . 14 ] ) . No major trends could be discerned in Israel and Taiwan . In decentralized DCT rollouts , the number of new cases increased significantly after the launch in France ( + 178 % ) , the United Kingdom ( + 361 % ) and Netherland ( + 198 % ) . A downward trend was observed in Germany and Estonia . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 Figure 2 . Comparison of centralized versus decentralized digital contact tracing ( DCT ) .

J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 Discussion In spite of mass vaccination campaigns against COVID - 19 in most countries , the control of pandemic remains frustratingly difficult to achieve . As we start the third year into the pandemic , some countries have started to ease the pandemic restrictions , whilst others such as China ( Shanghai ) have once again started to enforce lockdowns and closures . However , the effectiveness of these measures has been questioned [ 21 , 25 – 27 ] . It is likely that the effectiveness is dependent on a number of cofactors , including , type of containment measure , the degree of enforcement , public attitude and acceptance , extent of infection in the population , and the degree of testing [ 21 , 28 – 31 ] . Modeling studies have indicated the importance of early implementation of restrictions ; delays as little as a few weeks after an outbreak can have an unrecoverable impact on viral transmission [ 31 , 32 ] . The findings from this study reveal that conventional control strategies such as lockdowns , stay at home requests and school closures could not completely stop the transmission chain of SARS - CoV - 2 in most of the countries studied . Typically , such containment policies should lead to better control , but in real - world settings , they did not perform as expected . Poor enforcement and public acceptance of these measures is most likely to be an important contributing factor [ 33 ] . By contrast , centralized DCT was associated with a decline in the number of new cases . Several studies have demonstrated that government interventions can potentially reduce the peak number of COVID - 19 cases [ 15 , 34 , 35 ] . However , the timing of implementation and duration will influence the outcome [ 31 , 32 ] . Other studies have echoed the ineffectiveness of physical measures by assessing the impact of full lockdown strategies applied in some western countries [ 25 , 26 ] . These reports found no evidence of any discontinuity in the growth rate , and reproduction estimate trends after deploying full lockdown strategies . Results from a study of European countries revealed that the COVID - 19 epidemic can rebound when control measures are relaxed [ 36 ] . One possible reason could be the fact that compliance with population movement restrictions is difficult to sustain economically and socially [ 1 , 19 ] . DCT systems were effective in curtailing the spread of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus . These apps can be integrated into comprehensive control strategies [ 22 , 23 , 37 ] . DCT augments conventional public health strategies and is not considered a replacement for social measures . Effectiveness of DCT is enhanced when measures are implemented in a centralized and enforced manner [ 23 , 24 ] . For instance , South Korea , China , and Japan had successfully used centralized DCT apps to control the spread of COVID - 19 . Arguably , this involves placing J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 public interest above individuals’ right to privacy [ 38 – 40 ] . The legal basis and data governance structure for accessing and managing personal medical information during a public health crisis was encountered during the 2002 SARS and 2014 MERS coronavirus outbreaks [ 41 , 42 ] . It was apparent that tracing the movement of infected and exposed individuals is crucial . Despite initial enthusiasm for this approach in North America and Europe , privacy concerns and technical issues hampered the enforcement of centralized DCT [ 43 , 44 ] . Integrating DCT and conventional measures cannot only leverage the advantages of the two approaches but also help flag exposures and identify asymptomatic infected individuals . DCT entails trade - offs between public health protection and individual privacy [ 45 ] . Continued technical improvement may further increase efficacy , particularly across regional borders . Several factors hinder the uptake of DCT apps , these include privacy concerns , lack of trust , and suboptimal interface design [ 46 , 47 ] . As lockdowns and border restrictions did not stop the spread of COVID - 19 , there is a need for better guidance on the number of exposed contacts who need to be isolated . Previous studies about the number of close contacts vary significantly , from a few to more than 80 [ 35 , 48 ] . It is unrealistic to quarantine the whole population , as suggested in the case of Wuhan province . Our results also suggest that intercity and international travel closure could not effectively retard the spread of the virus . Virus spread continued after intercity lockdowns due to difficulties in tracking and validating travel information of returning domestic or international travelers [ 25 , 49 ] . Citizens inside lockdown cities going out without maintaining social distancing , and people outside entering the cities could not be accurately tracked . In South Korea , the initial success of implementing social distancing measures broke down after the first 20 days , which highlights the need to trace the source of infection for targeted containment . Hence , the critical role of DCT in countries such as Japan , in switching the trend from increasing to decreasing number of new cases , as shown in our results . Limitations Like any study of this nature , our study has a number of limitations . Country level data are subject to generalizations that can lead to ecological bias . Large countries such as China and the US are not homogenous in terms of policy implementation and case reporting . The first half of 2020 was a time of changes in policy and rapid deployment of preventive measures . Thus , cross effects of measures applied sequentially could contaminate our before - after data . The initial intense phase of COVID - 19 was also characterized by lack of systemic reporting , J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 changes in case definitions , and variable extent of enforcement of each containment measure . Thus , temporal patterns need to be interpreted cautiously . Despite these limitations , the study findings reflect real - world outcomes of public health measures , and hence the true limitations of using these measures to control a highly transmissible respiratory virus . These findings also reflect the reluctance of the public to respect these restrictions and to avoid circumventing protective measures for personal expediency . Conclusion Conventional containment measures widely implemented in the early outbreak of COVID - 19 were not sufficient to prevent the spread of the virus in most countries . However , strict enforcement of these strategies , combined with centralized DCT appears to be more effective . This approach , if implemented early in an outbreak , could contain and prevent spread beyond the epicenter .
