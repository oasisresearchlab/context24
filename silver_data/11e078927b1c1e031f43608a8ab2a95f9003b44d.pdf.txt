The screens have identified eight mutations , representing six loci . Mutations at three of the loci result in only maternal effects on embryonic viability . Mutations at the remaining three loci cause additional nonmaternal ( zygotic ) effects , including recessive lethality or sterility and dominant male mating defects . Mutations at five of the loci cause visible pregastrulation defects . Three mutations appear to be allelic with a recessive mutation of let - 354 . Gene dosage experiments indicate that one mutation may be a loss - of - function allele at a haploin sufficient locus . The other mutations appear to result in gain - of - function “poison” gene products . Most of these become less deleterious as the relative dosage of the corresponding wild - type allele is increased ; we show that relative self - progeny viabilities for the relevant hermaphrodite genotypes are generally M / + / + > M / + > M / M / + > M / Df > M / M , where M represents the dominant mutant allele . U NDERSTANDING the genetic control of Cae - norhabditis elegans embryogenesis will require identifying genes involved in patterning of the early embryo . Such genes have so far been sought almost exclusively in screens for recessive mutations causing embryonic lethality ( HIRSH and VANDERSLICE , 1976 ; WOOD et al . 1980 ; SCHIERENBERG , MIWA and VON EHRENSTEIN 1980 ; MIWA et al . 1980 ; ISNENGHI et al . 1983 ; DENICH et al . 1984 ; KEMPHUES et al . 1988 ) . These screens yielded mutations defining about 70 genes , most of which appear to act maternally ( for review , see WOOD 1988 ) , and led to an estimate of 200 - 600 genes that could mutate to alleles that cause embryonic lethality ( CASSADA et al . 1981 ) . However , based on a survey of probable null alleles , KEMPHUES , KUSCH and WOLF ( 1 988 ) estimated that there may be as few as a dozen maternally active genes whose prod - ucts are required only for embryogenesis . We have undertaken a different kind of screen with different biases , for dominant temperature - sensitive ( ts ) lethal mutations affecting C . elegans embryogen - esis , based on the following rationale . Dominant gain - of - function mutations , resulting for example in the expression of a normal gene product in the wrong tissue or at the inappropriate time during develop - ment , could yield additional information about the function of genes previously identified by recessive ’ To whom correspondence should be addressed . ’ Present address : European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Meyerhof - strase 1 , 6900 Heidelberg , Federal Republic of Germany . Genetics 125 : 351 - 369 ( June , 1990 ) mutations ( LEWIS et al . 1980 ; AMBROS and HORVITZ 1984 ; STRUHL 1985 ) . More important , it seems likely that some genes involved in early embryogenesis will be identifiable more easily , or perhaps only , by dom - inant rather than recessive mutations . There are at least three possible classes of such genes . First , members of redundant multigene families are likely to be identified only by dominant , gain - of - func - tion “poison” mutations ( SUZUKI 1970 ; WATERSTON , HIRSH and LANE 1984 ; see PARK and HORVITZ 1986 for review ) . Null mutations in these genes will have a wild - type phenotype , because other members of the family can supply the function of the defective locus . Gene families such as these may be common in C . elegans . PARK and HORVITZ ( 1986 ) examined domi - nant behavioral and morphological mutations at nine loci and found that homozygotes for apparent loss - of function alleles of four of the genes showed no mutant phenotype . They estimated that half the genes in C . elegans may have wild - type loss - of - function pheno - types . Similar estimates have been made for other organisms as well ( GOEBL and PETES 1986 ; DOVE 1987 ) . In C . elegans , dominant gain - of - function mu - tations have been found in known or suspected mem - bers of several multigene families , including an actin gene , unc - 92 ( WATERSTON , HIRSH and LANE 1984 ) , a tRNA gene , sup - 7 , ( WATERSTON 1981 ) , four known or probable collagen genes , sqt - 1 , sqt - 2 , sqt - 3 , and rol - 8 ( KUSCH and EDGAR 1986 ; KRAMER et al . 1988 ) , and a gene for an unidentified muscle component , unc - 93 352 P . E . Mains , I . A . Sulston and W . B . Wood ( GREENWALD and HORVITZ 1980 , 1982 ) . A second class of genes more easily identifiable in screens for dominant mutations are haploinsufficient loci , which are required in two normal doses . Loss - of - function mutations in essential haploinsufficient genes must be isolated as conditional alleles ( or in the pres - ence of a duplication ) . Such genes could encode com - ponents of morphogenetic gradients or other posi - tional signalling systems that would likely be sensitive to dosage , such as bicoid in Drosophila ( DRIEVER and NUSSLEIN - VOLHARD 1988 ) . Several mutations at hap - loinsufficient loci that result in disruption of embry - onic patterns have been found in this organism ( DE - NELL 1978 ; SIMPSON 1983 ; GELBART et al . 1985 ; FROHNHOFER and NUSSLEIN - VOLHARD 1986 ; GERGEN and WIESCHAUS 1986 ; MOHLER and WIESCHAUS 1986 ) . In C . elegans , unc - 108 ( PARK and HORVITZ 1986 ) , tra - 2 ( SCHEDL and KIMBLE 1988 ) , and fem - 3 ( BARTON , SCHEDL and KIMBLE 1987 ) may be examples of haplo - insufficient loci . A third class , likely to overlap the first , includes genes whose products form multimers in which one defective subunit could inactivate the complex ( KEM - PHUEs et al . 1980 ; WATERSTON , HIRSH and LANE 1984 ; KUSCH and EDGAR 1986 ; HERSKOWITZ 1987 ; ALBERS and FUCHS 1987 ; STACEY et al . 1988 ) , or for which the stoichiometry between different types of subunits must be strictly regulated ( ORKIN and KA - ZAZIAN 1984 ; MEEKS - WAGNER and HARTWELL 1986 ; HOMYK and EMERSON 1988 ) . We report here on the isolation and initial charac - terization of eight dominant ts maternal - effect embry - onic - lethal mutations in C . elegans . For each mutation we have determined the genetic map position , the site of production of the corresponding gene product ( egg , sperm , and / or embryo ) based on genetic tests for parental effects , and its time of action as deter - mined by temperature - shift experiments . We have also determined the resulting embryonic phenotype as observed by differential interference contrast ( No - marski ) microscopy , and whether the mutation results in a gain or loss of function based on gene dosage experiments . Although simple genetic complementa - tion tests are not feasible in all cases because of dom - inance , the map positions and other properties of the eight mutations suggest that they represent six genes . Two of these , let - 354 ( HOWELL et al . 1987 ; HOWELL 1989 ) and mei - 1 ( K . KEMPHUES and S . SPRUNGER , personal communication ) were previously identified by other mutations ; the remaining four have been named mel - 23 , mel - 24 , mel - 25 and mel - 26 ( for mater - nal - effect - lethality ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Culture conditions : C . elegans ( var . Bristol ) was main - tained according to BRENNER ( 1974 ) . Unless otherwise stated , all stocks and crosses were maintained at 15°C . The viability of self progeny was determined by scoring complete broods of 5 - 8 individual hermaphrodites ( 500 - 2500 em - bryos total ) . Animals were transferred daily to fresh plates preequilibrated to the appropriate temperature , until they stopped laying fertilized embryos . Each plate was scored for unhatched embryos one day after the hermaphrodite was removed . The following day , hatched animals were counted , and the number of arrested larvae ( those much smaller than their sibs ) was noted . For experiments at 15 O , animals were transferred every other day , and unhatched embryos were counted two days after the hermaphrodite was removed . Genes and alleles : Genetic nomenclature follows that described by HORVITZ et al . ( 1979 ) . LG refers to linkage group . M is used to designate the dominant ts allele in general genotype descriptions . The following genes and alleles were used ( also see Figure 1 ) : LG I : bli - 4 ( e937 ) , dpy - 5 ( e61 ) , emb - 6 ( hc65 ) , dpy - l4 ( e188 ) , let - 80 ( ~ 96 ) , let - 84 ( ~ 91 ) , let - 354 ( h79 ) , lin - lO ( e1438 ) , lin - 1 l ( n566 ) , lin - 28 ( n719 ) , mei - l ( b284 ) , unc - 1 l ( e47 ) , unc - 13 ( e450 and e1091 ) , unc - l5 ( e73 ) , unc - 29 ( e193 and e1072 ) , unc - 38 ( ~ 20 ) , unc - 73 ( e936 ) , unc - 74 ( e883 ) . LC 11 : ~ yg - 9 ( b244 ) . LC 111 : dpy - l7 ( e164 ) , dpy - l8 ( e364 ) , dpy - 28 ( ~ 939 ) , unc - LG IV : daf15 ( m81 ) , dpy - 20 ( e1282 ) , fem - 3 ( e1996 ) , unc - LG V : dafll ( m47 ) , emb - l8 ( g21 ) , him - 5 ( e1490 ) , unc - LG X : lon - Z ( e678 ) . Isolation of mutations : Mutagenesis with ethylmethane - sulfonate ( EMS , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) was carried out according to BRENNER ( 1974 ) . L4 hermaphrodites were mutagenized with EMS and the F1 progeny ( putative M / + ) were picked to individual plates at 15 O . After embryos were laid at the permissive temperature , worms were shifted to 25 " , allowed to self - fertilize for Id , and then removed . The following day , those pairs of plates that showed hatching at 15 " , but not 25 " , were selected . Of 2500 F1 worms screened , five proved to carry dominant ts lethal mutations . An alternative screen , where L4 F1 animals were first cloned at 25 O and then shifted to 15 O , produced three dominant ts mutations among 1500 tested worms . The overall frequency was eight mutations among 8000 mutagenized haploid ge - nomes . Each mutant was derived from a separate mutagen - ized parent . All mutations were outcrossed at least ten times to remove extraneous mutations induced by the mutagen and were mapped to intervals of 5 1 cM ( Figure 1 ) . For each mutation , an appropriate balancer chromosome , carrying closely linked flanking morphological markers , was chosen . Genetic mapping : Three - factor map positions were de - termined by selecting recombinants for the morphological markers from the following heterozygotes . The map posi - tions are shown in Figure 1 . The fraction of ts recombinants are indicated . let - 354 I : let - 354 ( ct42 ) / unc - 11 unc - 38 : Unc - 1 1 ( 4 / 1 I ) , Unc - 38 ( 7 / 11 ) .

Be - cause both ct60 and daf - ll are ts , the cross was carried out as follows . Heterozygous males of the above genotype , grown at 15 " , were backcrossed to unc - 42 daf - I I ; lon - 2 her - maphrodites at 25 " . There is no paternal - effect lethality associated with ct60 ( see RE - SULTS ) . Unc non Daf non Lon were tested for maternal - effect lethality . Daf - 1 I animals emerge from dauer inefficiently , and so these were not scored . mel - 26 I : mel - 26 ( ct61 ) / unc - 29 lin - 11 : Unc ( 10 / 24 ) , Lin 38 ( 3 / 8 ) . 12 ) . ( 1 4 / 22 ) . Allelism with other loci : Since our mutations are domi - nant , complementation with previously identified recessive mutations that map to the same region ( based on the 1989 C . elegans genetic map ; M . EDGLEY , personal communica - tion ) would be ambiguous . Allelism was often excluded by further mapping . ct42 , ct76 , ct77 : The recessive ts maternal - effect lethal mutations of emb - 6 map to the same interval as ct42 , ct76 and ct77 . However + + dpy - 5 / + emb - 6 + recombinants were readily recovered from M + dpy - 5 / + em6 + hermaphrodites as non - ts progeny ( 5 / 500 for ct42 , 4 / 435 for ct76 , and 4 / 280 for ct77 ) . A map distance this large ( 2 cM ) excludes allelism and indicates a probable map order of M emb - 6 dpy - 5 . This region has been saturated for zygotic - lethal muta - tions ( HOWELL et al . 1987 ; HOWELL 1989 ) , and ct42 , ct76 , and ct77 are likely to be alleles of let - 354 ( see RESULTS ) . Allelism was shown by crossing M dpy - 5 / unc - ll bli - 4 males to sDpZ ( 1 ; f ) ; let - 354 ( h79 ) dpy - 5 unc - I3 hermaphrodites at 15 " . The number of wild - type outcross progeny was noted , and Dpy larvae were picked to new plates and scored 3 days later for growth . Crosses using dpy - 5 / + males were used to determine the control frequency of Dpy offspring relative to their wild - type sibs . ct46 : Apparent loss - of - function intragenic revertants com - plemented let - 80 and let - 84 but did not complement mei - l ( b284 ) ( P . E . MAINS et al . in preparation ) . ct60 : A recessive ts maternal - effect lethal mutation of emb - 18 maps to the same region as ct60 . The high frequency of recombination between the mutations makes allelism un - likely . A total of five non - ts unc - 42 + + / + emb - 18 + recom - binants were found among 1900 non - Unc progeny of unc - 42 + ct60 / + emb - 18 + hermaphrodites . This corresponds to a map distance of 0 . 4 cM . Male rescue experiments : One L4 hermaphrodite was mated to five L4 and young adult N2 males at 25 " . Three to six crosses were done for each mutation . All animals were transferred after one day to fresh plates . The viability of the progeny at 25 " was determined as described in Culture Conditions . The following day , the hermaphrodites alone were shifted to 15 " , and the degree of outcrossing was assessed by scoring the morphological phenotypes of the progeny . These outcross progeny arise from male sperm stored during the mating at 25 ' . For male rescue experiments at 15 " , two L4 hermaphro - dites were mated to five L4 and young adult N2 males . Two to four such crosses were done for each mutation . All animals were transferred every other day , until her - maphrodites ceased producing fertilized eggs . The viability of progeny was scored as described in Culture Conditions , and the degree of outcrossing was determined by the mor - phological phenotype of progeny . Mating experiments with mutant males : Five young adult males and two L4 hermaphrodites were mated at 25 " . Two to three matings each were done for each mutation . All animals were transferred daily until the hermaphrodites stopped laying fertilized eggs . The progeny viability was assessed as described in Culture Conditions , except that prog - eny were allowed to reach adulthood before they were scored . The degree of outcrossing was determined by the morphological phenotype of the progeny ( see text and leg - end to Table 3 ) . Dosage experiments : The viability of all mutant strains was normalized to that of coisogenic strains lacking the ts mutation . Genotypes to be compared were matched for morphological phenotype . Dosage effects were determined by comparing viabilities of the sets of strains listed below under each of the mutant alleles . Only selected strain con - structions are described ; the others were done in a straight - forward manner . The map in Figure 1 shows the extents of the duplications and deficiencies used . let - 354 ( ct42 ) : sDPZ ( Z ; f ) / O ; ct42 dpy - 5 unc - 13 / dpy - 5 unc - I5 ( M / + / + ) ct42 dpy - 5 unc - 13 / unc - 15 ( M / + ) sDp2 ( Z ; f ) / O ; ct42 dpy - 5 unc - I3 ( M / M / + ) ct42 dpy - 5 / hDf6 dpy - 5 unc - 13 ( MIDf ) . ct42 dPy - 5 / ct42 dpY - 5 ( M / M ) Balanced strains containing sDp2 ( one copy per diploid genome ; two copies are lethal ) are similar to those described by HOWELL et al . ( 1987 ) . ct42 dpy - 5 / ct42 dpy - 5 were Dpy - 5 self progeny of ct42 dpy - 5 / unc - 73 dpy - I4 hermaphrodites . The number of sibs exhibiting the phenotype resulting from homozygosity of the balancer chromosome was used as the control value for the viability of these animals . The defi - ciency strain was constructed by crossing ct42 dpy - 5 / unc - 73 dpy - 14 males to hDf6 dpy - 5 unc - l3 / unc - l I bli - 4 hermaphrod - ites . Dpy larvae were picked to new plates and scored for growth three days later . The number of Unc - 73 progeny ( unc - 73 dpy - I4 / hDf6 dpy - 5 unc - 13 ) was also noted to control for the viability of the deficiency . let - 354 ( ct76 and ct77 ) : As described for ct42 . mel - 23 ( ct45 ) : mnDp37 [ unc - 32 ] ( III , f ) / O ; ct45 vab - 7 / dpy - 17 ct45 / dpy - l7 unc - 32 vab - 7 ( M / + ) mnDp37 [ un ~ - 32 ] ( ZII , f ) / O ; unc - 32 ct45 ( M / M / + ) . M / + / + animals were constructed by crossing ct45 vab - 7 / unc - 32 dpy - 18 males to mnDp37 [ unc - 32 ] / 0 ; dpy - 17 unc - 32 vab - 7 hermaphrodites ( which are Unc - 32 because mnDp37 carries a mutant unc - 32 allele ) and selecting wild - type off - spring . The FP progeny were checked for the absence of Dpy - 18 segregants to exclude the possibility of a crossover unc - 32 vab - 7 ( M / + / + ) 354 P . E . Mains , I . A . Sulston and W . B . Wood eliminating ct45 in the male parent . Two copies of mnDp37 per diploid genome is lethal . M / M / + animals were produced by crossing unc - 32 ct45 / dpy - 17 vab - 7 males to mnDp37 [ unc - 32 ] / 0 ; dpy - 17 vab - 7 her - maphrodites . Wild - type progeny were selfed , and Unc - 32 segregants were chosen . These should be mnDp37 [ unc - 32 ] / 0 ; unc - 32 ct45 ( unc - 32 ct45 homozygotes without the duplication are inviable ) . mei - l ( ct46 ) : sDpl ( I $ ) / O ; ct46 unc - 29 / dpy - 5 unc - 29 ( MI + / + ) dpy - 5 ct46 unc - 29 / + ( MI + ) sDpl ( l ; f ) O ; dpy - 5 ct46 unc - 29 ( MIMI + ) ct46 / dpy - 5 ct46 unc - 29 ( M I M ) nDp4 ( 1 ; ) / 0 ; ct46 unc29 / + unc - 29 ; lon - 2 / + ( MI + / + ) ct46 unc - 29 / + ; lon - 2 / + ( MI + ) nDp4 ( 1 ; ? ) / 0 ; ct46 unc - 29 ; lon - 2 / + ( MIMI + ) ct46 unc - 29 / ct46 + ( M / M ) ct46 unc - 29 / unc - 13 ct46 unc - 29 ( M I M ) unc - 13 ct46 unc - 29 / nDf23 ( MIDf ) . Two copies of either duplication is lethal . MI + / + animals were constructed by crossing ct46 unc - 29 males to sDpll0 ; dpy - 5 unc - 29 hermaphrodites and choosing wild - type prog - eny that segregated many Unc - 29 non - Dpy - 5 animals , or by crossing nDp4 / 0 ; ct46 unc - 29 ; lon - 2 hermaphrodites by ct46 unc - 29 males and choosing wild - type progeny . M / Df animals were generated as the Unc - 29 progeny of ct46 / unc - 13 ct46 unc - 29 males crossed to nDf23 / unc - l3 lin - 11 hermaphro - dites . mel - 24 ( ct59 ) : ct59 unc - 24 / mnTI2 ( N ; X ) / mnTI2 ( IV ; X ) ( M I + I + ) ct59 / unc - 24 dpy - 20 ( MI + ) unc - 24 / mnT12 ct59 ( IV ; X ) / mnT12 ct59 ( I R X ) ( MIMI + ) ct59 / ct59 ( M I M ) ct59 unc - 24leDfl8 ( MIDf ) Strains trisomic for LG IV were constructed by making use of a fusion chromosome of LG IV and LG X , mnTI2 ( IV ; X ) , as described by SIGURDSON et al . ( 1986 ) . These authors have shown that mnTl2 homozygotes are viable and fertile . Heterozygous hermaphrodites ( ZV / mnTIZ / X ) show high levels of meiotic nondisjunction between mnTl2 and the X and so have a Him phenotype ( high incidence of males ) among self progeny . The IVlmnTlZlO males are fertile . In addition , SIGURDSON et al . ( 1986 ) showed that hermaphro - dites heterozygous for mnTl2 show high levels of meiotic nondisjunction between mnTl2 and LG IV , often resulting in IV / mnTl2lmnTI2 . These animals are characterized as being Him , which is indicative of continued heterozygosity for mnTl2 and a normal LG IV . However , they will not segregate viable progeny showing the phenotypes for reces - sive markers carried on the normal LG IV , since these animals would lack mnTI2 and consequently be nullo - X . The presence of markers on the normal LG IV can be confirmed by test crossing the IV / mnTI2 / 0 male progeny of lV / mnT12 / mnT12 hermaphrodites . MI + / + animals were constructed as follows . ct59 / ct59 unc - 24 males were crossed to mnTl2 hermaphrodites . The F , ct59 unc - 24 / mnTl2 / X hermaphrodites segregate both males and Unc - 24 Fn self progeny . Hermaphrodites of the genotype ct59 unc - 24 / mnT12 / mnT12 were recognized among the F2 as being Him and not segregating Unc - 24 animals . The genotype was confirmed by crossing the Fs ct59 unc - 24 / mnT12 / 0 males to unc - 24 dpy - 20 ; him - 5 her - maphrodites . Because the hermaphrodite contained him - 5 , a high level of diplo - X gametes ( HODGKIN , HORVITZ and BRENNER 1979 ) would result in ct59 unc - 24 / dpy - 20 unc - 24 ; X / X hermaphrodite outcross progeny . These are Unc non Dpy and show ts maternal - effect lethality . The appearance of these progeny confirmed the presence of the ct59 unc - 24 - bearing chromosome in the ct59 unc - 24 / mnT12 / mnT12 animals . Each of the animals used in the experiments re - ported in Table 5 was tested in this manner . Coisogenic unc - 24 / mnT12 / mnT12 control animals were constructed and tested in a similar manner . M / M / + animals were constructed as follows . ct59 / ct59 unc - 24 males were crossed to mnTl2 hermaphrodites , and F1 animals which segregated males but not Unc - 24 offspring were selected ( ct59 / mnT12 / X ) . Recombinants between the ct59 on the normal LG IV and mnTl2 were identified by showing the ts maternal - effect lethality characteristic of ct59 / + , but not being Him ( mnT12 ct59 / mnTI2 ) . These were allowed to self , and animals with few viable embryos , a characteristic of ct59 homozygotes , were chosen . These mnTI2 ct59 / mnT12 ct59 animals were crossed to unc - 24 / + males , and progeny of the genotype unc - 24 / mnT12 ct59 / X , which segregated male and Unc - 24 offspring , were chosen . The self progeny which were Him , but did not segregate Unc - 24 ( unc - 24 / mnT12 ct59 / mnTl2 ct59 ) were the desired + / M / M animals . The genotype of each animal reported in Table 5 was confirmed by crossing their male progeny ( unc - 24 / mnT12 ct59 / 0 ) to unc - 24 dpy - 20 hermaphrodites . The unc - 24 chromosome was confirmed by the presence of Unc non - Dpy offspring . Their wild - type hermaphrodite sibs were tested for ts maternal - effect lethality to confirm the presence of ct59 . ct59 unc - 24 / eDf18 animals were the wild - type progeny of the cross of eDf18 / unc - 24 dpy - 20 males to ct59 unc - 24 her - maphrodites . Recombinant wild - type animals which had not received eDfl8 would be dpy - 20 / ct59 unc - 24 and would be recognized by the segregation of Dpy progeny . mel - 26 ( ct61 ) : sDpl ( I ; f ) IO ; unc - 29 ct61 lune - I I unc - 29 lin - 11 ( MI + / + ) ct61 lunc - 11 unc - 29 lin - 1 I ( MI + ) sDpl ( Cf ) / O ; unc - 29 ct61 lin - I1 ( MIMI + ) ct61lunc29 ct61 lin - I1 ( M I M ) nDp4 ( & ? ) IO ; unc - 29 ct61 / unc - 29 ct61 ; lon - 2 / + ( MI + / + ) unc - 29 ct61 / unc - 29 + ; lon - 2 / + ( MI + ) nDp4 ( I ; ? ) / O ; unc - 29 ct61 / unc - 29 ct61 ; lon - 2 / + ( MIMI + ) unc - 29 ct61 / unc - 29 ct61 ; lon - 2 / + ( M I M ) unc - 29 ct61 ( M I M ) unc - 29 ct61 lnDf23 ( MIDf ) MI + / + animals were constructed by crossing unc - 29 ct6I males to sDpl / O ; unc - 1 I unc - 29 lin - I I and picking wild - type progeny , or by crossing unc - 29 males to nDp4 / 0 ; unc - 29 ct61 ; Lon - 2 and picking wild - type progeny . M / Df animals resulted from crossing unc - 29 ct61 males to nDf23 / unc - l3 lin - I I hermaphrodites and choosing Unc - 29 offspring . Microscopic observations : Living embryos were dis - sected from gravid hermaphrodites in embryo buffer ( ED - GAR and MCGHEE 1986 ) , mounted on agar pads on a micro - scope slide and observed at 25 " with a Zeiss Universal Microscope equipped with Nomarski optics . At least five embryos were observed for each genotype . A Panasonic AG6050 videorecorder with a DAGE MTI camera was used for time - lapse observation . Embryos were flash - photo - graphed using Kodak Tech Pan 2415 film . In all figures , embryos are oriented anterior - left , dorsal - up . Temperature - sensitive period ( TSP ) : One - to four - cell embryos were dissected at 15 " or 25 " from gravid her - maphrodites in embryo buffer . The embryos were mounted C . elegans Mutations on an agar pad on a microscope slide and the Nomarski images were briefly recorded ( 51 min ) to assess the devel - opmental stage . After incubation for a specified period , the slides were shifted to the appropriate temperature where they would equilibrate within 1 - 2 min , and the embryos were scored the next day for hatching or for development to a well - formed larva within the eggshell . In cases where the temperature shift was performed before dissection , gravid hermaphrodites were transferred to plates or embryo buffer pre - equilibrated at 15 " or 25 " . Each time point represents 20 - 60 embryos . All reported times are normal - ized to 25 " . ct45 and ct60 were treated differently . Embryos were staged by picking two - cell embryos for ct45 or one - cell embryos for ct60 ( since the two - cell stage was grossly abnor - mal for this mutant ) . The embryos were placed on plates at the appropriate temperature . For ct60 the number of hatch - ing embryos that failed to grow was noted . The following developmental times , in min , at 25 " were used ( KEMPHUES et al . 1986 ; DEPPE et al . 1978 ) , and it was assumed that the growth rate at 15 " is half that at 25 " ( BYERLY et al . 1976 ) : fertilization , 0 ; appearance of pronu - clei , 20 ; pseudocleavage , 27 ; pronuclear meeting , 32 ; AB - P division ( first cleavage ) , 35 ; rnid - 2 - cel1 , 40 ; ' AB2 division , 45 ; mid 4 - cell , 52 ; ' AB4 division , 55 ; 4AB8 division , 68 ; HABIti division , 95 . Embryos dissected prior to pronuclear formation rarely survive due to incomplete shell formation and so were disregarded . RESULTS Initial characterization of mutations : A total of eight independent dominant ts embryonic - lethal mu - tations were isolated from among 8000 EMS - muta - genized haploid genomes ( see MATERIALS AND METH - ODS ) . This frequency is fivefold higher than that found by PARK and HORVITZ ( 1986 ) for dominant morpho - logical and behavioral mutations in C . elegans , and it is comparable to that found by SUZUKI ( 1970 ) for dominant zygotic ts lethal mutations in Drosophila . The mutations were given names and assigned to six genes as follows , based on tests to be described below : me1 - 23 ( ct45 ) , mel - 24 ( ct59 ) , mel - 25 ( ct60 ) , mel - 26 ( ct61 ) , mei - l ( ct46 ) and let - 354 ( ct42 , ct76 , ct77 ) . Figure 1 shows the genetic map positions of the six loci , derived from three - factor crosses as described in MATERIALS Hermaphrodites heterozygous for these mutations ( M / + ) were initially identified as animals producing a much higher percentage of hatching embryos at the permissive temperature of 15 " than at the restrictive temperature of 25 " ( Table 1 ) . In addition , animals homozygous for mel - 23 ( ct45 ) or for any of the let - 354 mutations ct42 , ct76 or ct77 were inviable at all tem - peratures , while homozygotes for mel - 25 ( ct60 ) showed non - conditional sterility . Homozygous mei - l ( ct46 ) , mel - 24 ( ct59 ) , and mel - 26 ( ct61 ) strains were viable and fertile at 15 " , although progeny embryos showed decreased hatching relative to those produced by het - erozygous hermaphrodites . Therefore , all eight mu - tations are semidominant , but will be referred to as dominant for convenience . AND METHODS . 355 ' e IV v FIGURE 1 . - Genetic map of selected regions of the C . elegans genome . The positions of the six genes defined by the dominant ts mutations ( let - 354 , mei - 1 , mel - 23 , mel - 24 , mel - 25 , and mel - 26 ) , are shown below the lines representing linkage groups . Extents of deficiencies are indicated by single lines and of duplications by double lines . Dashes indicate that these rearrangements extend beyond the regions of the map presented ; dots indicate that their boundaries have not been precisely determined . The screens employed could potentially yield both parental - effect ( maternal or paternal ) and nonparen - tal - effect ( zygotic ) dominant ts lethal mutations . For the latter , 25 % of the self - progeny embryos produced by heterozygous hermaphrodites should survive at 25 " ; for the former , none should survive ( assuming complete expressivity ) . As shown in Table 1 , all mu - tations except ct59 resulted in much less than 25 % survival of embryos from M / + hermaphrodites at 25 O , indicating parental - effect dominance with high ex - pressivity .

' Not determined . Same control used for both ct46 and ct61 . parental - effect mutation , but with incomplete expres - sivity . For several of the mutations , M / + hermaphro - dites at 25 " gave an appreciable number of embryos that hatched , but produced larvae that failed to sur - vive ( Table 1 ) . Self progeny of M / + hermaphrodites were scored for dominant or recessive zygotic phenotypes , in ad - dition to parental effects . As described above , five of the mutations resulted in a recessive zygotic lethal or sterile phenotype at 15 " . If there were an additional dominant zygotic effect on the viability of M / + em - bryos , then the fraction of + / + animals among the progeny of M / + hermaphrodites should be > 0 . 25 for those mutations that are homozygous viable , or > 0 . 33 for those known to be homozygous inviable . ( The + / + progeny could be identified by morphological mark - ers on the balancer chromosome . ) This test was most easily performed at 15 " or 20 " where a significant number of progeny hatched . Only ct60 showed an additional dominant zygotic effect on viability ( Table 1 ) . For ct59 / + hermaphrodites , the fraction of + / + animals among surviving self progeny was about 0 . 25 at all temperatures , indicating that this mutation , like the others , causes a dominant parental - effect lethality with incomplete penetrance rather than simply a dom - inant zygotic lethality . Male mating experiments : Because C . elegans is a self - fertilizing hermaphrodite , the observed parental effects could be mediated by the sperm rather than the oocyte , and thus would represent paternal effects rather than maternal effects . This possibility can be tested by providing non - mutant sperm from wild - type males crossed to mutant hermaphrodites at 25 " . The outcross progeny of a paternal - effect mutant should show full viability in such a test . As shown in Table 2 , this was not the case for any of the mutations ; outcross progeny of M / + hermaphrodites at 25 " failed to survive , showing that the effects are maternal . Like - wise , mating did not increase the frequency of surviv - ing embryos produced at 15 " by M / M hermaphro - dites homozygous for mei - Z ( ct46 ) , mel - 24 ( ct59 ) , or mel - 26 ( ct61 ) . However , for hermaphrodites heterozygous for let - 354 mutations , mel - 23 ( ct45 ) , or mel - Z5 ( ct60 ) , mating at 15 " did increase the percentage of hatching embryos that gave viable larvae , suggesting that the inviable larvae produced by these animals from self - fertilization ( Tables 1 and 2 ) represented predomi - nantly homozygous mutant progeny . Because the mutations are dominant , paternal ef - fects could also be detected by introducing the muta - tion into the zygote through sperm , in crosses at 25 " C . elegans Mutations 357 TABLE 2 Effects of mating to wild - type males on viability of progeny embryos from mutant hermaphrodites 15 " 25 ' Mutant Mated Self Mated Self let - 354 : ct42 dpy - 5 / unc - l1 dpy - 5 86 / 86 " ( 99 ) b 65 / 70 4 . 516 . 6 " ( 98 ) b 4 . 417 . 2 " ct76 dpy - 5 / unc - l1 dpy - 5 21 / 22 ( 99 ) 23 / 27 010 ( 100 ) 010 ct77 dpy - 5 / unc - l I dpy - 5 5916 1 ( 1 00 ) 43 / 50 3 . 113 . 3 ( 99 ) 1 . 711 . 7 ct45 unc - 69 / unc - 69 vab - 7 ND ' ND 010 ( 100 ) o / o ct45 / unc - 32 vab - 7 ; lon - 2 26 / 31 ( 99 ) 25 / 36 ND ND ct46 unc - 13 21 / 21 ( 99 ) 26 / 29 010 ( 100 ) 010 ct46 unc - 13 / dpy - 5 unc - 13 ND ND 2 . 412 . 4 ( 98 ) 4 . 714 . 7 ct59 unc - 24 6 . 516 . 7 ( 99 ) 3 . 513 . 9 ND ND ct59 unc - 24 / dpy - 20 unc - 24 ND ND 13 / 17 ( 89 ) 13 / 16 ct6V / unc - 42 ; lon - 2 25 / 36 ( 97 ) 11 / 27 1 . 018 . 9 ( 98 ) 2 . 319 . 6 ct61 unc - 29 6 . 316 . 4 ( 70 ) 15 / 15 ND ND ct61 unc - 29 / unc - 13 unc - 29 ND ND 0 . 1 / 0 . 1 ( 100 ) 0 . 410 . 4 mel - 23 : mei - I : mel - 24 : mel - 25 : mel - 26 : * Percent of total embryos hatching and surviving to at least late larval stageslpercent of total embryos hatching ( including those that arrested as larvae ) .

However , the data presented in Table 3 show that few unhatched embryos were seen in such crosses . Introducing these mutations to the zygote through male sperm by mating at 25 " bypasses the maternal - effect lethality , allowing easy detection of any addi - tional dominant ts zygotic effects without requiring temperature - shifts of embryos to avoid maternal ef - fects . Using appropriately marked chromosomes , the progeny that inherited the mutant allele can be distin - guished morphologically . In all cases shown in Table 3 , hermaphrodites conceived and reared at 25 " in this manner were fully viable and grew to adulthood . They showed no morphological defects , and were self - fertile when shifted to 15 " ( data not shown ) . However , males heterozygous for any one of three let - 354 mutations , mel - 23 ( ct45 ) , or mel - 25 ( ct60 ) and reared at 25 " were unable to mate efficiently at 25 " . These are the same five mutations that resulted in recessive zygotic invi - ability or hermaphrodite infertility . In some cases , mating efficiency improved when males were shifted as adults to 15 " and tested at that temperature . The tails of M / + males of the five strains that showed poor mating when reared at 25 " often exhibited defects visible in the dissecting microscope , yielding a Mab ( male abnormal ) phenotype . Two of the mutations caused additional maternal effects at 15 " . The progeny of mei - l ( ct46 ) , mei - I ( ct46 ) / + , and mel - 26 ( ct6I ) hermaphrodites showed , as adults , a Vab ( variable abnormal ) morphological phenotype with low penetrance . The defects seen included an absent or abnormal tail whip , a truncated tail , thickened body ( usually posteriorly ) , and Dpy or Roller phenotypes . The penetrance of these defects among outcross progeny was the same when the above hermaphrodites were mated to mutant or wild - type males ( Table 4a ) , demonstrating that this was a ma - ternal - effect phenotype . Male and hermaphrodite progeny were affected equally ( data not shown ) . Some of the Vab hermaphrodite offspring from the cross of ct46 / + hermaphrodites by + / + males were tested for maternal - effect temperature - sensitivity , and 6 / 12 were found to be + / + , confirming the maternal - effect nature of the Vab phenotype . The effect for ct46 was semidominant and slight ts ( Table 4b ) . The effects are not due to a second linked mutation , based on the following arguments . ct46 and ct61 had been out - crossed 12 times following mutagenesis , so the pres - ence of an unlinked vu6 mutation is highly unlikely . The mei - I ( ct46 ) chromosome present in the her - maphrodites listed in Table 4 was derived from cross - over events within 1 cM on both sides of ct46 , and the mel - 26 ( ct61 ) chromosome was derived from a cross - over event within 1 cM to the left of ct61 . The possibility of linked vu6 mutations is therefore remote . In addition , suppressors of the mei - l ( ct46 ) maternal - 358 P . E . Mains , I . A . Sulston and W . B .

The normal frequency of male self progeny is < 0 . 2 % ( HODGKIN , HORVITZ and BRENNER 1979 ) . In summary , the mutations mei - l ( ct46 ) , mel - 24 ( ct59 ) , and mel - 26 ( ct61 ) behaved as strict dominant ts maternal - effect lethal mutations . The mutations Eet - 354 ( ct42 , ct76 , and ct77 ) , mel - 23 ( ct45 ) , and mel - 25 ( ct60 ) also resulted in strict ts dominant maternal - effect lethality . These latter five mutations were also associated with nonconditional recessive zygotic le - thality ( or sterility in the case of ct60 ) and caused specific dominant ts zygotic male mating defects . The allelism of the let - 354 mutations ct42 , ct76 , and ct77 was established as follows . All mapped to the same small region on LG I ( MATERIALS AND METHODS ) , and their phenotypic effects were very similar . They failed to complement one another for the recessive zygotic lethality and also failed to complement the previously identified recessive lethal let - 354 ( h79 ) ( data not shown ) as described more fully in a subsequent section . Also as described below , their responses in gene dosage experiments , their TSPs , and their em - bryonic phenotypes were similar . Allelism for the remaining mutations was ruled out by genetic map - ping or complementation tests using intragenic re - vertants of the dominant mutation ( see Figure 1 and MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . Nature of the gene defects : The nature of domi - nant mutations may be inferred from gene dosage experiments ( MULLER 1932 ) . In interpreting such ex - periments , it is assumed that the concentration of a mutant or wild - type gene product is roughly propor - tional to the number of copies of the respective alleles that are present . A dominant loss - of - function mutation ( a haploinsuf - ficient locus ) should show complete suppression of the mutant phenotype upon addition of a duplication of the wild - type locus to give the genotype M / + / + . A deficiency uncovering an essential haploinsufficient locus ( Of / + ) should be impossible to recover in a diploid . A dominant mutation that results in over - expression or hyperactivity of the normal wild - type gene product should show suppression of the mutant phenotype when a wild - type allele is replaced with a deficiency for the region ( M / Df ) , while addition of a duplication ( AI / + / + ) should enhance the mutant phenotype . A dominant " gain - of - function " mutation resulting in a gene product that competes with the wild - type product ( e . g . a " poison " ) should show at least partial suppression of the resulting phenotype by addition of an extra dose of the wild - type allele ( M / + / + ) . A gain - of - function mutation that shows no competition with the normal gene product ( e . g . , resulting in inappro - C . elegans TABLE 4 mei - I ( ct46 ) and mel - 26 ( ct61 ) cause dominant maternal - effect Vab phenotypes Percent Vab among surviving Hermaphrodite Male progeny Temperature a ) Maternal effects on outcross progeny " mei - 1 : unc - 13 ct46 unc - 29 ct46 10 . 0 15 " unc - 13 ct46 unc - 29 N2 11 . 2 15 " unc - I3 unc - 29 ct46 0 15 " unc - I3 ct46 unc - 29 + + unc - 29 ct46 3 . 8 unc - 13 ct46 unc - 29 + + unc - 29 N ? 3 . 7 15 " 15 " mel - 26 : unc - 29 ct61 ct6I 22 . 2 15 " unc - 29 ct61 unc - 29 N2 16 . 3 15 " + unc - 29 ct61 unc - 13 unc - 29 + ct61 0 . 8 15 " + unc - 29 ct61 unc - 13 unc - 29 + N ? 0 . 9 15 " b ) Maternal effects on self progeny showing slight temperature sensitivity * mei - I : unc - 13 ct46 unc - 29 + + + unc - 1 . 3 ct46 unc - 29 + + + 2 . 5 15 " 5 . 5 20 The indicated hermaphrodites were crossed to the indicated males at 15 ' ; numbers indicate percent Vdb animals among outcross progeny only .

Totals of 500 - 1000 progeny were scored . priate expression of the wild - type product in time or location ) should not be affected by the dosage of the wild - type locus . Dosage tests were carried out on alleles at five of the six loci as follows . let - 354 ( ct42 , ct76 , ct77 ) : For each of these three mutations , as shown in Table 5 , heterozygous her - maphrodites carrying an extra dose of the wild - type locus as a duplication ( M / + / + ) produced 5 - 1 O - fold more embryos that hatched at 25 " than did hetero - zygotes lacking the duplication ( M / + ) . Although the values for the strong allele , ct76 , were low at 25 " , a clear increase was seen at 15 ' . For all three mutations , M / M / + hermaphrodites were much less fertile than the corresponding M / + hermaphrodites , showing very low if any progeny viability even at 15 " , and indicating a strong dosage dependence of the mutant product in the presence of one dose of the wild - type product . At 15 ' all three mutations caused recessive zygotic lethality as noted earlier : M / M embryos often survived to mid - larval stages , and very rarely to the L4 stage . However , M / Df embryos arrested at a much later Mutations 359 point in larval development than the M / M progeny of M / + hermaphrodites . Table 5 shows that most such ct42 / DJ ct76 / DJ and ct77 / Df animals reached the L4 / adult stage , at both 15 " and 25 " . However , these animals never produced embryos ( except for a few that all proved to be recombinants lacking the ts mutation ) . These data showed that ct42 , ct76 , and ct77 displayed a non - ts zygotic dose dependency in the absence of wild - type gene product and that wild - type product was required for fertility in the presence of these mutations . Therefore , the dominant Zet - 354 mu - tations seem to result in gain - of - function poisons that can compete with the wild - type gene product and that result in dosage - dependent phenotypes in the pres - ence or absence of wild - type gene product . The recessive mutation let - 354 ( h79 ) , which results in zygotic early larval arrest ( HOWELL et al . 1987 ; HOWELL 1989 ) , behaves similarly , but not identically to a deficiency of the region . When ct42 , ct76 or ct77 / + males were crossed to hermaphrodites carrying let - 354 ( h79 ) ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) , the resulting Mllet - 354 animals showed larval arrest , but unlike M / Dfanimals produced in similar crosses , fewer than 5 % grew to the L4 stage ( data not shown ) . Therefore , it is likely that ct42 , ct76 , and ct77 are alleles of let - 354 , but h79 is apparently not a true null . mel - 23 ( ct45 ) : The dominant maternal - effect lethal - ity resulting from this mutation was dramatically sup - pressed by the presence of an extra wild - type allele in the form of a free duplication . ct45 / + hermaphrodites produced only one hatched larva ( which arrested ) out of 4455 embryos at 25 " ( Table 5 ) . In contrast , ct45 / + / + hermaphrodites produced 86 % hatching prog - eny embryos at 25 " . However , there was also an additive effect of an additional dose of ct45 relative to the heterozygote . While ct45 / + hermaphrodites pro - duced 36 % hatching embryos at 15 " ( Table l ) , 27 / 27 ct45 / ct45 / + animals produced either no hatched embryos or no embryos at all . This was also true of 29 / 29 animals reared at 14 " ( data not shown ) . Therefore , the ct45 gene product could be a gain - of - function poison that is very efficiently competed by the wild - type product . Alternatively , mel - 23 could be a haploinsufficient locus , as suggested by the nearly complete suppression by a single extra copy of the wild - type gene . However , it would then be puzzling that the self progeny embryos from ct45 / ct45 / + her - maphrodites exhibit much reduced hatching relative to those of ct45 / + , since the opposite would be ex - pected ( see DISCUSSION ) . mei - I ( ct46 ) : As shown in Table 5 , presence of a maternal duplication ( M / + / + ) resulted in a four - to ten - fold increase in progeny viability at 25 " relative to the heterozygote ( M / + ) , depending on the dupli - cation used .

Both values are shown so that animals of the same morphological phenotype can be compared . See MATERIALS AND METHODS . * Because there are no flanking markers to the left of ct46 uncovered by the deficiency ( nDf23 ) used in the experiment shown in Table 5 , it is possible that ct46 also is not uncovered . However , a second larger , overlapping deficiency , nDf24 , which does uncover a flanking marker on the left , yielded the same results ( data not shown ) . The increase in progeny viability compared to the homozygote was seen in six separate experiments using both deficiencies and at various temperatures . Chromosomes were used that had undergone crossovers within 1 CM on either side of ct46 . This would make it unlikely that these results were due to a second deleterious recessive mutation closely linked to ct46 that was not uncovered by the deficiency and therefore was heterozygous in ct46 / Df but homozygous in ct46 / ct46 animals . ' It is possible that the deficiency used ( eDf18 ) did not uncover ct59 . There is no flanking marker to the left of ct59 uncovered by this deficiency . The same is true for a second deficiency ( eDfl9 ) that gave similar results ( data not shown ) . The result may then be the nonspecific decrease in the viability of embryos from ct59 / + hermaphrodites ( 97 % at 15 " , Table 1 ) beyond the 25 % zygotic lethality expect from the deficiency . ( Note that the data presented is corrected for this decrease . ) However , sDf2 IV , which does not cover ct59 , showed no decrease in viability relative to ct5Y / + beyond the expected 25 % when heterozygous with c159 ( data not shown ) . Chromosomes were used that had undergone crossovers within 1 cM on either side of ct59 . This would make it unlikely that these results were due to a second deleterious recessive mutation closely linked to ct59 that was not uncovered by the deficiency and therefore was heterozygous in ct59 / Dfbut homozygous in ct5Y / ct59 animals . Same as for mei - l ( ct46 ) . It is possible that the deficiency used ( nDf23 ) did not uncover ct61 , since it uncovered no flanking markers to the right of ct61 . Therefore , this result could represent a nonspecific decrease in the viability of progeny from ct61 / + hermaphrodites ( 99 % at 15 " , Table 1 ) beyond the 25 % zygotic lethality expected from the deficiency . This is unlikely , since a second deficiency , nDf24 , which removes a region overlapping nDf23 , behaved similarly to nDf23 ( data not shown ) . In addition , ct62 / + I ; eDfl8 / + IV showed no nonspecific decrease ( data not shown ) . C . elegans Mutations 36 1 percentage of hatching progeny than the heterozy - gote , indicating a dosage effect of ct46 in the presence of a wild - type allele . At 15 " and 20 O , M / M / + hermaphrodites produced a lower percentage of hatching embryos than did homozygous ( M / M ) hermaphrodites , suggesting that the mutant gene product may function better alone than in the presence of wild - type product . However , it is also possible that this result could be caused by non - specific effects of the large duplications used ( see footnote i , Table 5 and DISCUSSION ) . Finally , M / Df hermaphrodites produced a higher percentage of vi - able progeny than M / M hermaphrodites ( Table 5 ) , indicating a dosage effect of the mutation in the absence of the wild - type allele ( see footnote k , Table Elsewhere ( P . E . MAINS et al . in preparation ) we will show that ct46 interacts with mutations at two other loci on LGI , one of which is mel - 26 ( ct61 ) . The dupli - cations used above included both these loci while the deficiencies removed the mel - 26 locus . This could complicate the interpretation of the gene dosage ex - periments and could be responsible for the unexpect - edly decreased viability in ct46 / ct46 / + . A similar sit - uation has been described in Drosophila ( KENNISON and RUSSELL 1987 ) . Nevertheless , the ct46 mutation is likely to result in a gain - of - function poison that can compete with wild - type gene product , and that shows dosage effects on phenotype either in the presence or absence of wild - type gene product . We will present evidence elsewhere ( P . E . MAINS et al . , in preparation ) that the ct46 mutation is an allele of the mei - 1 gene . mel - 24 ( ct59 ) : Heterozygous ct59 hermaphrodites carrying an extra dose of the wild - type gene ( M / + / + ) produced only about 1 . 5 times more viable embryos than heterozygous M / + hermaphrodites at 25 " ( Table 5 ) indicating little competition between the mutant and wild - type products . It should be noted that the ct59 / + / + animals carried an entire extra copy of LG IV ( see DISCUSSION ) . The dosage of the mutant ct59 gene product showed effects in both the presence and absence of wild - type gene product . At 15 " , M / M / + hermaphro - dites produced only 14 % viable embryos , compared to 96 % from M / + hermaphrodites . Progeny of M / Df hermaphrodites at this temperature showed a ten - fold higher percentage of viability than those of M / M hermaphrodites ( see footnote I , Table 5 ) . Therefore , ct59 appears to result in a gain - of - func - tion poison product , which is poorly competed by extra wild - type product and unusually sensitive to dosage in the absence of wild - type product . mel - 25 ( ct60 ) : Dosage experiments have not yet been carried out on this locus , because of the unavailability of both duplications for this region of LGV and defi - ciencies that unequivocally uncover the locus . 5 ) . mel - 26 ( ct61 ) : Viability of self - progeny embryos was 35 - 80 - fold higher for M / + / + than for M / + her - maphrodites at 25 " depending upon the duplication used . Likewise , the viability of embryos from M / M / + was intermediate between that of embryos from M / + and M / M hermaphrodites ( Table 5 ) . In contrast to results with the other dominant ts mutations , M / Df hermaphrodites showed no higher progeny viability than M / M hermaphrodites at 15 " ( see footnote n , Table 5 ) . Therefore , this mutation appears to result in a gain - of - function poison with which the wild - type product competes effectively , but which does not show a dos - age effect in the absence of wild - type product . As noted above , ct61 interacts with mutations in other genes on LGI including mei - l ( ct46 ) , and this could complicate the interpretation of the gene dosage ex - periments . Embryonic phenotypes : Living embryos produced by hermaphrodites carrying each mutation were ex - amined using Nomarski optics at 25 " . For embryos that did not become too disorganized , lineages were observed from shortly after fertilization through the beginning of gastrulation , that is , up to 28 cells at 100 minutes postfertilization ( DEPPE et al . 1978 ; SULSTON et al . 1983 ) . The position and timing of the first divisions in the MS , E , C , D , and P lineages were noted . After the second round of cell divisions of the AB lineage , only the timing of the AB divisions was followed . Embryos were also observed briefly at approxi - mately 5 , 8 , 11 , and 24 hr postfertilization to deter - mine the terminal phenotype . The degree of morpho - genesis and the expression of differentiation markers for the muscles ( twitching ) and intestine ( gut birefrin - gence ) was noted at 24 h postfertilization ( LAUFER , BAZZICALUPO and WOOD 1980 ) . Temperature - shift experiments ( WOOD et al . 1980 ) were used to define the TSP for each mutation . All reported times are normalized to the 25 " rate of development ( see MA - TERIALS AND METHODS ) . Wild - type development : For comparison , normal em - bryogenesis is illustrated in Figure 2 . Shortly after fertilization , the maternal and paternal pronuclei be - come visible at the anterior and posterior of the embryo , respectively , and begin to move toward each other . After a brief pseudocleavage ( Figure 2A ) , the pronuclei come together in the posterior region ( Fig - ure 2B ) . They subsequently fuse , and the embryo immediately begins first cleavage , with the spindle oriented along the anterior - posterior axis ( Figure 2C ) . The division is unequal resulting in the larger anterior AB cell and the posterior P1 cell ( Figure 2D ) . The second cleavage round begins with the symmetric division of AB , quickly followed by the asymmetric division of P1 ( Figure 2E ) . The anterior and dorsal P . E . Mains , I . A . Sulston and W .

D ) Two - cell embryo , showing that anterior AB cell is larger than the posterior PI cell . E ) Second cleavage showing AB entering mitosis slightly earlier than PI . F ) Four - cell embryo . The AB daughters are the anterior and dorsal cells ; the PI daughters are the ventral EMS and the posterior Ps cell . cells in the four - cell embryo are AB descendants , while the ventral EMS and posterior P2 cells are the daugh - ters of PI ( Figure 2F ) . Gastrulation takes place be - tween 100 and 300 min ; most cell proliferation ceases shortly thereafter , and morphogenesis begins ( for fur - ther details see SULSTON et al . 1983 ; WOOD 1988 ) . let - 354 ( ct42 , ct76 , ct77 ) : Self - progeny embryos from M / + hermaphrodites showed similar defects in both mitosis and cytokinesis during the early cleavages ( data not shown ) . Nuclear envelope breakdown was usually on schedule , but incomplete nuclear division and cytokinesis often occurred . Spindles were poorly developed and multiple nuclei within individual cells were often observed . Cleavage furrows were weak and often disappeared . This was especially apparent for ct77 where embryos still appeared to have only two cells even after the second round of division . The TSP for all three mutations extended from the one - cell to the four - cell stage . mel - 23 ( ct45 ) : In self - progeny embryos from M / + hermaphrodites at 25 " , the first observable defect was at the three - cell stage . In wild - type two - cell embryos , the AB cell begins to divide before the PI cell , but division of PI begins before AB division is completed ( Figure 3A ) . In embryos from mutant hermaphro - dites , the PI division did not begin until after comple - tion of the AB division ( Figure 3B ) . In the four - cell embryo , the EMS cell normally remains on the ventral midline , and the two AB cells are positioned on the dorsal and anterior sides of the embryo ( Figure 3C ) . In embryos from mutant hermaphrodites , the EMS cell was more anterior than normal ( Figure 3D ) . These embryos appeared to rotate about the longitu - dinal axis at the four - cell stage , so that the EMS cell took up a ventral - right ( 4 / 5 embryos ) or a ventral - left . , .

In normal embryos these spindles would usually be at right angles to the focal plane . yielding a very small cross - sectional area .

The next AB cleavage round occurred at the normal time , but with a dorsal - ventral rather than the normal left - right orientation ( Figure 3E - H ) . The EMS division was about 50 % behind schedule , and subsequent division rounds of all cells were delayed by a factor of about two . Embryos arrested with about 28 cells , near the onset of gastrulation . No twitching or gut birefringence was subsequently observed . The TSP for embryonic lethality of progeny from M / + hermaphrodites began approximately 2 hrs prior to fertilization and ended about 6 hrs later , at the end of gastrulation ( Figure 4 ) . Surprisingly , however , if oocytes developing at 25 " were downshifted prior to the beginning of the TSP , up to 95 % of the embryos hatched . This result contrasted sharply with the hatch - ing percentage of 36 % for embryos that developed entirely at 15 " ( Table 1 ) or for embryos upshifted after the end of the TSP ( Figure 4 ) . Therefore , being at the restrictive temperature for a period prior to the TSP was beneficial to these embryos . Approximately 25 % of the hatching animals arrested as larvae ; these were presumably the ct45lct45 segregants . The ani - mals that grew to adulthood displayed the usual ct45 / + ts phenotype .

Results of downshift experiments are shown by triangles connected with dashed lines and upshift experiments by circles connected with solid lines . mei - l ( ct46 ) and mel - 26 ( ct61 ) : Self - progeny embryos from these mutants showed similar phenotypes . For ct46 , both M / M ( Figure 5 ) and M / + hermaphrodites produced embryos in which the maternal and paternal pronuclei appeared to migrate normally , but the first cleavage occurred longitudinally rather than trans - versely ( Figure 5A - C ) . An anterior cytoplast formed , but later re - fused with one of the other cells ( Figure 5D - E ) . The longitudinal cell boundary then rotated to a transverse plane , with an abnormally large AB cell ( compare to Figure 2D ) . Multiple nuclei were sometimes present . Cell boundaries were generally not well defined , and cytoplasmic exchange occurred . The AB and PI cells divided simultaneously ( rather than AB first , as normally ) but a somewhat normal - appearing four - cell embryo often resulted ( Figure 5F ) . No morphogenesis occurred , but variable degrees of twitching and gut birefringence were seen in different embryos . Embryos from homozygous ct61 hermaphrodites at 25 " were similar to those of ct46 mutants ( compare Figures 5 and 6 ) . The phenotype was often more extreme , in that weak cleavage furrows often disap - peared and the nuclei coalesced . An embryo with no distinct cell boundaries but with many nuclei often resulted ( Figure 6D ) . The phenotype of embryos from ct61 / + her - maphrodites at 25 " was less severe . The first cleavage often appeared normal , except that the mitotic spin - dles were short and poorly formed . Cleavage furrows were often indistinct and disappeared ( data not shown ) . The embryos arrested prior to morphogenesis and showed gut birefringence and twitching . The phenotypes resulting from both the ct46 and ct61 mutations closely resemble that caused by reces - sive maternal - effect lethal mutations in the unlinked gene zyg - 9 11 , except that the latter embryos show the additional defect that pronuclear migration does not FIGURE 5 .

The TSP resulting from zyg - 9 ts mutations such as 6244 occurs during first cleavage ( KEMPHUES et al . 1986 ) . We carefully compared the TSPs of ct46 / + , ct61 / + , and homozygous 6244 animals ( MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . As shown in Figure 7 , the TSP for all three strains began abruptly during the first division , that of zyg - 9 ( 6244 ) homozygotes being delayed slightly . The ending of each TSP was gradual , espe - cially for zyg - 9 ( 6244 ) . For all three strains the first survivors were seen in shifts near the end of the first division , and the TSP ended by the onset of gastru - lation . mel - 24 ( ct59 ) : The self progeny from M / M her - maphrodites displayed no obvious lineage abnormali - ties prior to the onset of gastrulation . Terminal em - bryonic phenotypes varied depending upon the gen - otype of the hermaphrodite parent . M / M animals produced self - progeny embryos that arrested with no morphogenesis , but showed twitching and strong gut birefringence ( 22 / 22 embryos ) . M / + hermaphrodites showed incomplete penetrance for maternal - effect le - thality ( Table 1 ) ; 14 / 3 1 embryos developed to late morphogenesis or hatched . The remaining embryos arrested while undergoing an abnormal early mor - phogenesis and showed strong gut birefringence and twitching . One quarter of the 3 1 embryos should have been homozygous for ct59 , and yet none arrested as early as those from homozygous hermaphrodites . Therefore , the different arrest points seen for em - bryos from homozygous and heterozygous herma - phrodites result from maternal , rather than zygotic effects . The TSP for embryos from ct59 / + herma - phrodites occurred between about 60 to 90 min post - fertilization . mel - 25 ( ct60 ) : Embryos from M / + hermaphrodites 364 P . E . Mains , I . A .

The first cleavage spindle was usually small and indistinct and cytokinesis often failed . In these cases , the two nuclei coalesced , and the embryo divided simultaneously into four cells . Some embryos never underwent cytokinesis , and resulted in single cells with many nuclei . Embryos arrested at early morphogenesis and showed twitching and gut bire - fringence . The TSP for embryonic arrest of these embryos began at about the time of fertilization and ended by the beginning of gastrulation . However , the larvae hatching from embryos shifted up during gastrulation failed to grow . The TSP for larval arrest gradually ended by the beginning of morphogenesis ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION Phenotypic properties of mutants : The properties of the eight ts mutations we have analyzed are sum - marized in Table 6 . We have referred to them as dominant for convenience ; however , all cause more severe defects when homozygous and are , therefore , semidominant . All show dominant ts embryonic le - thality . This lethality shows a strict maternal effect , and no paternal or zygotic effects : at the restrictive temperature , + / + self - progeny embryos from heter - ozygous hermaphrodites are inviable , as are all em - bryos from such hermaphrodites when fertilized by wild - type sperm , while embryos from mated wild - type hermaphrodites fertilized by sperm bearing the mu - tant allele develop normally . Five of the mutations also show recessive zygotic effects . let - 354 ( ct42 , ct76 , and ct77 ) and mel - 23 ( ct45 ) result in non - conditional recessive lethality , while mel - 25 ( ct60 ) causes gonadogenesis defects resulting in sterility . These recessive effects could result from Time ( min ) FIGURE 7 . - TSP for the viability of self - progeny embryos from mei - l ( ct46 ) / + , mel - 26 ( ct6 / ) / + and homozygous zyg - Y ( b244 ) her - maphrodites .

Arrows indicate times of synchronous division onset for cells in the AB lineage .

These same five mutations also caused dominant nonmaternal - effect ts defects in male mating , probably due to apparent abnormalities in the male tail . Therefore , the corresponding gene prod - ucts could be active in processes occurring during embryogenesis as well as male tail morphogenesis ( and perhaps other processes , in which minor defects are not so readily observable ) . The remaining three of the eight mutations , mei - l ( ct46 ) , mel - 24 ( ct59 ) , and mel - 26 ( ct61 ) result only in strict maternal - effect , ts phenotypes . However , the mei - l ( ct46 ) and mel - 26 ( ct6I ) mutations also result in a low - penetrance , semidominant , maternal - effect Vab phenotype at permissive temperatures . This may in - dicate that the corresponding gene products are used twice during embryogenesis , or that slight perturba - tions in the early embryo , which are themselves not lethal , can lead to other later defects . The dominant phenotypes resulting from mei - I ( ct46 ) and mel - 26 ( ct61 ) are reminiscent of those caused by recessive maternal - effect mutations in the unlinked zyg - 9 gene ( WOOD et al . 1980 ; ALBERTSON 1984 ; KEMPHUES et al . 1986 ) . The possible signifi - cance of this observation will be discussed in detail elsewhere ( MAINS et al . , in preparation ) . The TSPs of mei - l ( ct46 ) , mel - 26 ( ct61 ) , and ryg - 9 ( b244 ) were similar , beginning abruptly just after fertilization . The endings of the TSPs were gradual , but the first survivors were seen among embryos shifted up at the end of the first cleavage .

I " I . Not determined . for 6244 might be slightly later than for ct46 and ct61 . It appears then that the products of these genes are essential during the first cleavage ( or for ct46 and ct61 , presence of the poison gene products during this time disrupts embryogenesis ) , but there is also a less stringent requirement for these gene products later in development since the TSP does not end until the onset of gastrulation . KEMPHUES et al . ( 1 986 ) reported that the z3g - 9 TSP was precisely confined to a short period during the middle of the first cleavage , shortly before pronucleus formation , while we find that the ending is gradual . However , KEMPHUFS et al . ( 1986 ) observed embryos in utero ( allowing a very precise staging of the embryos ) and scored only the orienta - tion of the first cleavage . We instead dissected em - bryos from hermaphrodites and scored hatching . Therefore , a normal first cleavage as observed by KEMPHUES et al . ( 1 986 ) is necessary but not sufficient for subsequent viability . Consistent with this conclu - sion is the proposal by KEMPHUES et al . ( 1986 ) that the normal zyg - 9 product is required to produce the very large spindle of the first cleavage . Subsequent cleavages have smaller spindles , but still may have a partial requirement for the wild - type zyg - 9 product . Nature of dominant mutations : The mode of ac - tion of dominant mutations can be inferred from gene dosage experiments ( see RESULTS and MULLER 1932 ) . The let - 354 mutations ct42 , ct76 , and ct77 , as well as mei - 1 ( ct46 ) and mel - 26 ( ct61 ) appear to result in gain - of - function poisons that compete with the correspond - ing wild - type products in a dose - dependent manner . With a few exceptions , the viabilities of self - progeny embryos from mutant hermaphrodites decrease with increasing dosage of the mutant allele relative to the wild - type allele , according to the series MI + / + > M / + > M / M / + > M / Df > M / M . The relative severities resulting from the latter two genotypes , showing dose - dependency of M in the absence of the + allele , may indicate that the poison also affects the products of other genes in a dose - dependent manner . The excep - tions to these results included ct61 / D j which showed the same progeny viability as ct61lct61 , and ct46 / ct46 / + , which exhibited lower progeny viability than ct46 / ct46 ( see RESULTS and footnote i , Table 5 ) . In all cases where a deficiency was available , results obtained with the + / Of genotype showed that one dose of wild - type product was sufficient for full viability ; that is , these loci are not haploinsufficient . The above observations would suggest that these mutations result in antimorphic gene products as de - fined by MULLER ( 1932 ) . However , by this definition the phenotypes resulting from such mutations should resemble those caused by loss - of - function alleles at the same locus , because the antimorphic products inhibit wild - type function . Instead , the phenotype resulting from recessive ( presumed loss - of - function ) alleles of let - 354 ( zygotic larval lethality ; HOWELL 1989 ) differs from that caused by the apparent dominant alleles ct42 , ct76 and ct77 ( maternal - effect embryonic lethal - ity ) . Moreover , we will show elsewhere that loss - of - function alleles of mei - 1 result in embryonic defects that differ markedly from ct46 ( P . E . MAINS et al . , in 366 P . E . Mains , I . A . Sulston and W . B . Wood preparation ) . Therefore , MULLER ' S antimorphic defi - nition may be too specific or simplistic for these mu - tations . In contrast to the mutations discussed above , the mel - 24 ( ct59 ) mutation showed little effect of dosage relative to the wild - type allele , arguing against gene - product interaction . This mutation may be neo - morphic by MULLER ' S ( 1 932 ) definition , resulting in a gene product that has a novel function ( or site or time of expression ) and does not compete with the wild - type product . The results with ct59 could be compli - cated because the ct59 / + / + animals used were tri - somic for the entire LG IV . Animals trisomic for wild - type LG IV are morphologically normal ( SIGURDSON et al . 1986 ) , but one third of their self - progeny em - bryos failed to hatch at 25 " in our control experi - ments , presumably due to aneuploidy in the zygotes . The viability of embryos from ct59 / + / + animals was normalized to this value , but the large correction makes somewhat questionable the significance of the slight viability increase over embryos from ct59 / + hermaphrodites . The meZ - 23 ( ct45 ) mutation may represent loss - of - function at a haploinsufficient locus . The viability of self - progeny embryos increased almost 4000 - fold when the relative dose of the wild - type allele was increased from 1 / 2 ( M / + ) to 2 / 3 ( M / + / + ) by addition of the free duplication mnDp37 ; 86 % of the embryos from ct45 / + / + hermaphrodites hatched . This result represents nearly complete rescue , because about 10 % of the embryos from these hermaphrodites should be homozygous for ct45 and lacking the free duplication ( 40 % of the progeny of mnDp37 - bearing hermaphro - dites did not inherit the duplication ; data not shown ) . Because these ct45lct45 embryos are inviable , the maximum expected survival of ct45 / + / + progeny em - bryos should be about 90 % , even if the maternal - effect lethality were completely suppressed . It seems surprising that such complete rescue would result from simple competition between the wild - type and mutant products . As predicted for a maternal - effect lethal haploinsufficiency , no deficiency has been iso - lated for the region containing ct45 . Moreover , there is indirect evidence for a haploinsufficient region on the right half of LG 111 . JOHNSEN and BAILLIE ( 1 988 ) reported that fewer y - ray - induced lethal mutations ( many of which should be deficiencies ) were recovered in this region relative to EMS - induced lethal muta - tions ( presumably mostly point mutations ) compared to other regions of the genome . J . PLENEFISCH ( per - sonal communication ) was unable to isolate a defi - ciency of the dpy - 28 locus , which maps 0 . 4 cM from ct45 . However , arguing against the haploinsufficiency hy - pothesis for mel - 23 is the lower progeny viability of ct45 / ct45 / + hermaphrodites compared to ct45 / + her - maphrodites at 15 " . If the ct45 product showed only partial activity at permissive temperature ( consistent with the 36 % viability of embryos from ct45 / + her - maphrodites ) then an extra dose of the ct45 allele should increase progeny viability . Possible reasons for the observed opposite effect could be associated with the single wild - type allele being present on the free duplication in ct45 / ct45 / + animals : the gene might function less efficiently there due to position effects ( e . g . , it is now closer to the chromosome end ) , or the tissue where the gene is expressed might often be mosaic due to duplication loss . Alternatively , the in - viability could result from the zygotic effects of ct45 noted earlier ( recessive lethality and dominant male mating defects ) , which could be independent of a maternal haploinsufficiency for the gene . There are reported cases of autosomal dosage com - pensation in both maize ( BIRCHLER 198 1 ) and Dro - sophila ( DEVLIN , HOLM and GRICLIATTI 1988 ) . If the mel - 23 locus were dosage compensated , the expression of each allele would be decreased by ' / s in ct45 / ct45 / + relative to the diploid . The benefit of the additional ct45 allele ( which is hypomorphic at 15 " ) could be outweighed by the ' / s decrease in activity of the wild - type allele in ct45 / ct45 / + , resulting in the lack of viable progeny . ( The possibility of autosomal dosage compensation should not change the interpretations discussed for the other mutations . The relative amounts of the gene products , rather than absolute amounts , are more important when mutant and wild - type products compete . ) Therefore mel - 23 ( ct45 ) could be a loss - of - function mutation at a haploinsufficient locus based on the observed results . Alternatively , ct45 could result in a gain - of - function poison whose effects are extremely sensitive to an increase of the relative proportion of wild - type product . T o distinguish these alternatives , we will try to isolate a deficiency for the region in the presence of a duplication so that progeny viability can be tested for + / Dfhermaphrodites . If there proves to be a maternal haploinsufficiency in the region , the deficiency could be maintained as + / + / Of . The TSP of meZ - 23 ( ct45 ) revealed an additional unusual property of this mutation . The viability of embryos from M / + hermaphrodites reared early at restrictive temperature but downshifted prior to the beginning of the TSP was dramatically improved rel - ative to embryos from M / + hermaphrodites reared entirely at the permissive temperature ( 95 % vs . 36 % ) . This could indicate that the ct45 product is cold - sensitive for a period prior to its time of heat sensitivity ( e . g . , cold sensitive for assembly , heat sensitive for function ) . Alternatively , the mutant product could interact with other products that are induced at 25 " which enable it to function more efficiently when later downshifted ( e . g . , heat shock proteins ) . C . elegans Mutations 367 The mutations ct42 , ct76 and ct77 are apparently alleles at the let - 354 locus . Their properties , although quantitatively different , are qualitatively similar . They result in similar embryonic phenotypes , have similar TSPs , and respond similarly in gene dosage experi - ments . They all map to the same 1 - cM interval and fail to complement for recessive zygotic lethality . They all show the same behavior when combined with a deficiency of the region or with a recessive point mutation of let - 354 . It might seem unusual to have isolated three gain - of - function alleles at the same locus among only 4000 F1 progeny of mutagenized animals . The frequency of loss - of - function alleles in an “averaged” C . elegans gene after standard EMS mutagenesis is estimated to be 1 / ~ ~ ~ ~ gametes ( BRENNER 1974 ; GREENWALD and HORVITZ 1980 ; ANDERSON and BRENNER 1984 ; PARK and HORVITZ 1986 ) , and dominant gain - of - function mutations are generally expected to be rare . However , dominant mutations resulting in gain - of - function poi - sons can be more frequent among gene products that form large supramolecular structures ( KUSCH and ED - GAR 1986 ) . Dominant alleles of unc - 54 ( the major myosin heavy - chain gene ) occur at the same frequency as recessive mutations , probably because of the ability of a defective subunit of myosin to disrupt muscle structure ( BEJSOVEC and ANDERSON 1988 ; MACLEOD et al . 1977 ; WATERSTON , HIRSH and LANE 1984 ) . Dominant alleles also occur frequently in other C . elegans structural proteins , including paramyosin ( unc - 15 , WATERSTON , FISHPOOL and BRENNER 1977 ) , actin ( unc - 92 , WATERSON , HIRSH and LANE 1984 ) , and known or probable members of the collagen gene family ( sqt - I , sqt - 2 , sqt - 3 , and 701 - 8 , KUSCH and EDGAR 1986 ; KRAMER et al . 1988 ) . A dominant nonsense allele has been described in the flight muscle actin gene of Drosophila ( KARLIK , COUTU and FYRBERC 1984 ) , and deletion mutations in keratin genes can also be dominant ( ALBERS and FUCHS 1987 ) . The Zet - 354 gene product may likewise function in some large supramolecular structure . Interestingly , let - 354 also mutates to recessive alleles at an unusually high frequency ( HOWELL 1989 ) . How - ever the recessive allele let - 354 ( h79 ) did not behave identically to a deficiency of the region when hetero - zygous combinations with any one of the three domi - nant mutations were examined for recessive zygotic lethality . M / let - 354 ( h79 ) and M / M animals arrested as early larvae while M / Df animals arrested much later . This implies that h79 is not a true null mutation , and in view of our evidence that wild - type activity decreases the effects of the dominant mutations , h79 might even be a weak gain - of - function allele . While h79 did not exhibit any ts dominant maternal - effect lethality , one of seven other tested alleles , let - 354 ( h482 ) , did so ( HOWELL 1989 ; A . M . HOWELL , personal communication ) . These observations , fur - ther substantiating the high frequency of gain - of - function alleles at this locus , support the likelihood that the let - 354 gene product functions in a large supramolecular array . In summary , we have isolated eight dominant ts maternal - effect lethal mutations , defining six loci . Mu - tations at three of the loci show only strict maternal effects ; the others cause associated zygotic pheno - types . Mutations at four of the loci appear to result in gain - of - function poisons , while one may be a loss - of - function mutation in a haploinsufficient locus . T w o of the loci appear to encode gene products that inter - act with each other and with products of the ryg - 9 locus during early embryonic cleavage , as will be further described elsewhere . Thus screening for dom - inant maternal - effect mutations has proven to be an effective means of identifying loci that may encode components of supramolecular structures in the early embryo . Further analysis of these genes and the cor - responding mutant phenotypes should be helpful in understanding the morphogenetic events of the first cleavages . We would like to thank M . FULLER , L .
