However , it was still unclear which strategy was more cost - effective . Therefore , this study was conducted to evaluate this . Methods This study used data from patients who initially stayed at HI , CI , and hospitel under supervision of Ramathibodi Hospital between April and October 2021 . Outcomes of interest were hospitalisation and mortality . An incremental cost - effectiveness ratios ( ICER ) was calculated based on hospital perspective using home isolation as the reference . Results From 7 , 077 patients , 4 , 349 2 , 356 , and 372 were admitted at hospitel , HI , and CI , respectively . Most patients were females ( 57 . 04 % ) and the mean age was 40 . 42 ( SD = 16 . 15 ) . Average durations of stay were 4 . 47 , 3 . 35 , and 3 . 91 days for HI , CI , and hospitel , respectively . The average cost per day for staying in these corresponding places were 24 . 22 , 63 . 69 , and 65 . 23 US $ . For hospitalisation , the ICER for hospitel was at 41 . 93 US $ to avoid one hospitalisation in 1 , 000 patients when compared to HI , while CI had more cost , but less cases avoided . The ICER for hospitel and CI were at 46 . 21 and 866 . 17 US $ to avoid one death in 1 , 000 patients . Conclusions HI may be cost - effective isolated strategy for preventing hospitalisation and death in developing countries with limited resources .

Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 Introduction COVID - 19 outbreak was first identified in Wuhan , Hubei province , China in 2019 and later spread all over the world [ 1 , 2 ] . The clinical symptoms of COVID - 19 ranges from asymptomatic to symptomatic includ - ing fever , cough , fatigue , sore throat , dyspnea , diarrhea , headache and loss of taste and smell [ 3 , 4 ] . The risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome was about 9 . 4 % with mortality rate of 3 . 2 % [ 5 ] . The majority of patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms [ 6 , 7 ] . The virus is highly transmitted via droplets and fomites [ 8 – 10 ] , thus , patients should be immediately isolated to prevent viral transmission [ 11 ] . WHO guidance recommended that the isolation of the patients with mild to moderate symptoms could be done at an appointed COVID - 19 health facility , commu - nity facility , or by self - isolation at home depending on the care pathway [ 12 ] . Isolation hotel , known as hospitel , is also another option for patients who experience home - lessness during COVID - 19 infection and this strategy could also reduce hospital admission [ 13 ] . Thailand was the first country outside China to report the first case of laboratory confirmed COVID - 19 on Jan - uary 13th , 2020 , for a Chinese woman from Wuhan [ 14 ] . Later , the first local human - to human transmission of COVID - 19 in a Thai taxi driver was reported on January 31st , 2020 [ 15 ] . The Thai government officially declared COVID - 19 as a dangerous communicable disease under the Ministry of Public Health ( MOPH ) ’s communicable disease ACT B . E 2558 ( 2015 ) . On March 26th , 2020 all areas of the Kingdom of Thailand were declared by the Thai Prime Minister to be pursuant to the Emergency Decree on Public Administration in emergency situations [ 16 ] . Measures and regulations of the Thai government included restriction of international travel , screening all ports of entry and quarantine of travellers . Guidelines related to COVID - 19 were developed and distributed to medical and non - medical personnel by the MOPH . Multiple strategies were used to manage patients and relieve pressure for hospital capacity including hospitel , home isolation ( HI ) , and community isolation ( CI ) . The hospitel was transformed from vacant hotels during the pandemic by the collaboration of public administrations , private and public hospitals , and hotels [ 17 ] . HI , targeted on low - risk patients , has been implemented with special technology for remote tracking and warning system [ 18 ] . CI facilities were set up to look after low - risk patients who could not isolate themselves at home [ 19 ] . It was operated by collaboration of people who lived in that community and hospital , whilst some facilities were also equipped with mobile X - ray vehicles [ 20 ] . Ramathibodi Hospital , is a tertiary care - university hos - pital under Mahidol University located in Bangkok . Dur - ing the COVID - 19 outbreak , multidisciplinary working groups and strategies had been set up to cope with the situation including care pathway , preparation of care facilities , medical equipment , personnel / public educa - tion , and COVID - 19 call center . In addition , the HI , CI , and hospitel were care facilities that could operate with joint referral systems between out - hospital facilities and hospital . Each setting had different additional costs , i . e . , costs of renting hotels included dietary for hospitel , cost of building renovation ( disposable items ) for CI , and dietary costs for both HI and CI . Given the constraints of health - care resources , the cost - effectiveness of these strategies in management of the outbreak was very important . A systematic review of cost - effectiveness of COVID - 19 policy measures was conducted by including only a few studies which investigated the treatment strategies [ 21 ] . Sheinson et al . showed that treatment for COVID - 19 hospitalised patients were cost - effective under a health payer , a soci - etal , and a fee - for - service ( FFS ) payment model perspec - tive when compared to supportive care [ 22 ] . A study from South Africa found that the incremental cost - effective - ness ratio of general ward versus general ward plus inten - sive care was ZAR 73 , 091 per disability adjusted life year , which averted disabilities was below threshold , showing non - cost - effectiveness [ 23 ] . A cost - effectiveness analy - sis of expanding ICU bed capacity in Germany showed cost - effective if bed utilisation was low [ 24 ] . For isolation strategy , there was only one study conducted in Australia which found that HI was cost - effective relative to hospitel quarantine [ 25 ] . Furthermore , there was no report of the result of isolation models among low to middle income countries , where health care systems ( e . g . , health insur - ance system , healthcare accessibility , or standard of care ) , economic systems ( e . g . , incomes , household expendi - tures , or budget allocation ) and societal structures ( e . g . , level of education , beliefs , or local governance ) are dif - ferent relative to high income countries . Moreover , these might affect to the expense of health care and patient important outcomes . In addition , isolation strategy such as CI has neither been explored for cost - effectiveness nor reviewed , which might be important information for hos - pital to make decision when facing to new emerging dis - ease . Thus , this cost - effectiveness study was conducted to compare HI , CI , and hospitel isolation strategies with hospital perspective . Materials and methods This was a cross - sectional study focused on cost - effec - tiveness analysis of HI , CI , and hospitel isolation strate - gies evaluated based on a causal conceptual frame - work in Supplement Fig . 1 . To control the initial disease pro - gression and severity symptoms of patients , only COVID - 19 patients with asymptomatic or mild symptoms were included . Patients were enrolled with the following Page 3 of 9 Suthutvoravut et al . Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 criteria : aged 15 years or older , had been infected with COVID - 19 with asymptomatic or mild symptoms , and initially underwent any of the isolation strategies of inter - est ( i . e . , HI , CI , and hospitel ) provided by Ramathibodi Hospital between 1st April and 31st October 2021 . Patients who had been firstly admitted as inpatients at Ramathibodi Hospital were excluded . This study was approved by the Ethic committee , Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital , Mahidol University board ( COA MURA2021 / 866 ) . Once COVID - 19 was confirmed , patients with mild symptoms or asymptomatic were isolated at home , or renovated public shelters ( e . g . , stadium , local govern - ment meeting hall or school ) and hotels for HI , CI and hospitel isolation , respectively . For HI , healthcare staffs would consider and assess if households had appropri - ated facilities for isolation to prevent transmission among members of household , i . e . , had a separate room with included bathroom , had separated common room and / or kitchen . In addition , patients and family members were emphasised and concerned about the importance of strict standard precautions , basic infectious controls , and not allowed to leave from specified area . For CI , patients stayed in temporary shelter or restricted areas where were organized and looked after by local governments under supervision of hospital staffs . For hospitel isolation , Ramathibodi Hospital had col - laborated with a few hotels nearby and setup isolations under supervisions of nurse and doctor teams . Patients were strictly stayed in their rooms since enter without meeting in persons with other patients . Food , water , and medications were provided and delivered . Accord - ing to this study’s protocol , standard precaution guide was advised to all patients . Vital signs ( i . e . , pulse rate , body temperature and pulse oximeter ) were daily self - measured and reported to hospital staff by telephone . In addition , patients in HI and hospitel were also daily contacted by hospital staffs via telephone , video call via line application to follow up their sign and symptoms . If worsening of symptom was suspected , patients would be transported to hospital for further evaluation and treat - ment under the same treatment protocol for HI , CI and hospitel . Baseline characteristics , clinical , and utilisation data of all eligible patients were retrieved from the hospital information system and RamaCare application , which was developed to collect patient daily COVID - 19 comor - bidities e . g . , COPD , diabetes mellitus , etcetera . The inter - vention of interest was isolation strategy including , HI , CI or hospitel . Two outcomes of interest were hospitali - sation and mortality . Cost - effectiveness analysis was per - formed in hospital perspective for both outcomes based on decision tree model , see Fig . 1 . The model started with asymptomatic or mild symptoms COVID - 19 patient who were allocated to isolation place , then they were trans - ferred to admit at the hospital if they had more severe symptoms or stayed in the isolation area until discharge ( i . e . , dead or alive ) . Patients might need oxygenation either in isolation place or in the hospital . Cost measurement Only direct medical cost was measured by retrieving all facility and medical care utilisations ( e . g . , room , drug , medical supply , dietary , etcetera ) incurred during the treatment period . Three approaches were applied for unit cost calculation , i . e . , the University Hospital Network ( UHOSNET ) ’s project , the margins announced from the Comptroller General Department’s guideline , and activity based costing . The UHOSNET covered 89 . 3 % of all costs , which calculated cost per unit based on the summation of variable and fixed costs with complicated allocation criteria by using the total costs of treatment in Ramathibodi Hospital between 1st October 2020 and 30th September 2021 . For additional new services cre - ated after the UHOSNET’s project those were calculated in accordance with the guideline for drug pricing of the Comptroller General’s Department [ 25 ] , except the new services related to room or dietary costs which were based on the investment in building , i . e . , costs of renting hotels for hospitel , cost of building renovation ( dispos - able items ) for CI , no room cost for HI , and unit cost of special room without toilet for hospitalisation . In addi - tion , dietary costs for both HI and CI were at 8 . 17 US $ per day whereas it was 0 . 27 US $ per meal for hospitalisa - tion . There was no extra dietary cost for hospitel , since it was already included in rental cost . All costs were con - verted from Thai Baht to US $ at 36 . 71 [ 26 ] and reported as 2021 value . Data analysis – baseline , cost description , cost - effectiveness analysis Costs ( i . e . , total cost , cost per admission , and per patient day ) were described by isolation strategies . Univariate analysis was performed to compare characteristics of patients ( i . e . , age , gender , and comorbidities ) and costs among the 3 isolation strategies . For modelling , the costs were calculated separately by 2 periods , i . e . , ( A ) before hospitalisation and ( B ) after hospitalisation , see Fig . 1 . For cost outcome , i . e . , only cost in period A was con - sidered , while cost of both periods was added for death outcome . Oxygen utilisation was separately calculated per admission since the date of oxygenation could not be identified . In addition , cost of each isolation strategy was categorised by product type and showed by percentage of total treatment cost . Cost - effectiveness analysis was performed based on the decision tree model by applying cost parameters ( cost per patient day x patient day per admission ) , plus cost of Page 4 of 9 Suthutvoravut et al . Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 oxygen for each arm , while transitional probabilities were calculated as a ratio of each arm in the decision tree from this study’s raw data see Supplementary Fig . 2 . Incremen - tal cost - effectiveness ratios were calculated for surrogate outcome ( as US $ per hospitalisation avoidance in 1000 ) and final outcome ( as US $ per death avoidance in 1000 ) , using home isolation as the reference strategy in Micro - soft Excel and TreePlan addin . The equation used to cal - culate the cost and incremental cost - effectiveness ratios ( ICER ) for each intervention arm were as detail below . The estimated ICERs of three intervention arms were then compared using HI as the reference group . Cost = Costper patientday × Patientdatper admission Cost = Cost exp − Cost control Outcome exp − Outcome control Results A total of 7 , 077 COVID - 19 patients with asymptomatic and mild symptoms were isolated at Ramathibodi facili - ties between 1st April and 31st October 2021 . Of them , 4 , 349 , 2 , 356 and 372 patients stayed at hospitel , HI , and CI , respectively . Characteristics of these patients are described in Table 1 . HI patients seemed to be older and might have more comorbidities ( i . e . , COPD , cardiovascu - lar disease , diabetes mellitus , ESRD , hypertension , men - tal illness , and stroke ) than the other two groups . Most Fig . 1 Decision tree model Page 5 of 9 Suthutvoravut et al . Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 of patients were enrolled to hospital ( 61 . 5 % ) , whereas 33 . 3 % and 5 . 2 % were HI and CI , respectively , see Table 2 . The highest hospitalisation rate was found in CI ( 5 . 38 % ) , whereas the rates in HI and hospitel were 4 . 07 % and 3 . 72 % , respectively , see Table 3 . However , the highest death rate was in HI ( 8 . 49 / 1000 ) , followed by CI and hos - pitel of 8 . 06 / 1000 and 1 . 61 / 1000 , see Table 4 . Overall treatment costs were about 3 . 216 , 0 . 993 , and 0 . 294 million US $ spending for hospitel , HI , and CI patients , respectively , see Table 2 . The costs per admission was highest in CI followed by hospitel and HI with the costs of 789 , 740 , and 422 US $ , respectively . Costs per patient per day of these corresponding strate - gies were 76 , 82 , and 46 US $ , in which hospitel had the highest followed by CI , then HI . Cost by product type for each isolation strategy was displayed ( see Fig . 2 ) , which suggested that costs for rooms were the major item in hospitel ( 44 . 29 % ) and CI ( 49 . 05 % ) , while drug cost was the major item for HI ( 32 . 19 % ) . Combined costs of room and drug consumed more than half for all 3 isolation Table 1 Describe demographic data by Covid - 19 isolation strategies Factorn ( % ) Totaln = 7 , 077 Home isolation n = 2 , 356 Community isolation n = 372 Hospiteln = 4 , 349 p - value * Age , mean ( SD ) 40 . 42 ( 16 . 15 ) 43 . 89 ( 17 . 70 ) 42 . 22 ( 17 . 94 ) 38 . 38 ( 14 . 71 ) < 0 . 001 Gender Male 3 , 040 ( 42 . 96 ) 1 , 011 ( 42 . 91 ) 178 ( 47 . 85 ) 1 , , 851 ( 42 . 56 ) 0 . 141 Female 4 , 037 ( 57 . 04 ) 1 , 345 ( 57 . 09 ) 194 ( 52 . 15 ) 2498 ( 57 . 44 ) Cancer Yes 352 ( 4 . 97 ) 146 ( 6 . 20 ) 12 ( 3 . 23 ) 194 ( 4 . 46 ) 0 . 002 No 6 , 725 ( 95 . 03 ) 2 , 210 ( 93 . 80 ) 360 ( 96 . 77 ) 4 , 155 ( 95 . 54 ) COPD Yes 217 ( 3 . 07 ) 99 ( 4 . 20 ) 12 ( 3 . 23 ) 106 ( 2 . 44 ) < 0 . 001 No 6 , 860 ( 96 . 93 ) 2 , 257 ( 95 . 80 ) 360 ( 96 . 77 ) 4 , 216 ( 97 . 56 ) Cardiovascular disease Yes 1297 ( 18 . 33 ) 576 ( 24 . 45 ) 69 ( 18 . 55 ) 652 ( 14 . 99 ) < 0 . 001 No 5 , 780 ( 81 . 67 ) 1 , 780 ( 75 . 55 ) 303 ( 81 . 45 ) 3 , 697 ( 85 . 01 ) Diabetes mellitus Yes 353 ( 4 . 99 ) 151 ( 6 . 41 ) 20 ( 5 . 38 ) 182 ( 4 . 18 ) < 0 . 001 No 6 , 724 ( 95 . 01 ) 2 , 205 ( 93 . 59 ) 352 ( 94 . 62 ) 4 , 167 ( 95 . 82 ) ESRD Yes 181 ( 2 . 56 ) 102 ( 4 . 33 ) 4 ( 1 . 08 ) 75 ( 1 . 72 ) < 0 . 001 No 6 , 896 ( 97 . 44 ) 2 , 254 ( 95 . 67 ) 368 ( 98 . 92 ) 4 , 274 ( 98 . 28 ) HIV Yes 22 ( 0 . 31 ) 8 ( 0 . 34 ) 3 ( 0 . 81 ) 11 ( 0 . 25 ) 0 . 175 No 7 , 055 ( 99 . 69 ) 2 , 348 ( 99 . 66 ) 369 ( 99 . 19 ) 4 , 338 ( 99 . 75 ) Hypertension Yes 1 , 126 ( 15 . 91 ) 513 ( 21 . 77 ) 62 ( 16 . 67 ) 551 ( 12 . 67 ) < 0 . 001 No 5 , 951 ( 84 . 09 ) 1 , 843 ( 78 . 23 ) 310 ( 83 . 33 ) 3 , 798 ( 87 . 33 ) Liver disease Yes 148 ( 2 . 09 ) 55 ( 2 . 33 ) 9 ( 2 . 42 ) 84 ( 1 . 93 ) 0 . 492 No 6 , 929 ( 97 . 91 ) 2 , 301 ( 97 . 67 ) 363 ( 97 . 58 ) 4 , 265 ( 98 . 07 ) Mental illness Yes 147 ( 2 . 08 ) 77 ( 3 . 27 ) 7 ( 1 . 88 ) 63 ( 1 . 45 ) < 0 . 001 No 6 , 930 ( 97 . 92 ) 2 , 279 ( 96 . 73 ) 365 ( 98 . 12 ) 4 , 286 ( 98 . 55 ) Obesity Yes 542 ( 7 . 66 ) 220 ( 9 . 34 ) 30 ( 8 . 06 ) 292 ( 6 . 71 ) 0 . 001 No 6 , 535 ( 92 . 34 ) 2 , 136 ( 90 . 66 ) 342 ( 91 . 94 ) 4 , 057 ( 93 . 29 ) Stroke Yes 112 ( 1 . 58 ) 60 ( 2 . 55 ) 6 ( 1 . 61 ) 46 ( 1 . 06 ) < 0 . 001 No 6 , 965 ( 98 . 42 ) 2 , 296 ( 97 . 45 ) 366 ( 98 . 39 ) 4 , 303 ( 98 . 94 ) Tuberculosis Yes 74 ( 1 . 05 ) 18 ( 0 . 76 ) 3 ( 0 . 81 ) 53 ( 1 . 22 ) 0 . 195 No 7 , 003 ( 98 . 95 ) 2 , 338 ( 99 . 24 ) 369 ( 99 . 19 ) 4 , 296 ( 98 . 78 ) * Comparisons were performed by one - way analysis of variance and Chi - square tests for quantitative and categorical data , respectively Page 6 of 9 Suthutvoravut et al . Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 strategies , i . e . , 53 . 11 , 69 . 26 , and 61 . 72 % for HI , CI , and hospitel , respectively . Average durations of stay were 3 . 35 , 3 . 91 , and 4 . 47 days for CI , hospitel , and HI , respectively ( see Table 3 ) . The average costs per day for staying in these corresponding places were 63 . 69 , 65 . 23 and 24 . 22 US $ . Cost for hospi - talisations highly increased for all isolation types with the average costs per day of 323 . 95 , 622 . 42 , and 541 . 51 US $ , respectively , which were much higher than costs for those patients who still stayed at isolation areas with cor - responding average daily costs of 60 . 95 , 62 . 45 , and 21 . 65 US $ , respectively . In addition , for any patient who need oxygenation , the add - on cost was at 2 . 91 – 7 . 54 US $ per admission . The terminal node ( blue triangle ) of all 3 decision trees presented the total cost of each arm with the final out - come as death or home ( alive ) . When rolling - back the tree , the cost would be calculated back , weighted with its probability at each choice node ( green circle ) . Cost per admission was highest in CI , followed by hospitel , and HI with average cost / admission of 789 , 740 , and 422 US $ , respectively , see Table 4 . Incremental cost - effectiveness ratios ( ICER ) were further estimated for hospitalisation and death using HI as the reference . For hospitalisation , the ICERs were 41 . 93 and − 8 . 07 US $ for hospitel and CI , respectively to avoid one hospitalisation in 1 , 000 patients when compared to HI , indicating CI was not cost - effec - tive since more cost was spent for worse outcome i . e . , higher rate of hospitalisation . Whereas the hospitel was cost - effective relative to HI if the willingness to pay is more than 41 . 93 US $ per one case avoided . For death outcome , both CI and hospitel strategies could save more lives , although the cost for one case avoided from CI strategy ( 866 . 17 US $ ) was about 20 times more expensive than hospitel ( 46 . 21 US $ ) when compared to HI . Discussion This study was conducted to investigate the cost - effec - tiveness of HI , CI and hospitel isolations using a deci - sion tree model . This study found that cost per each isolation was lower in HI relative to hospitel and CI , in which CI was the most expensive measure .

Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 CI was not cost - effective with worse outcomes compared to the other two strategies . Cost per hospitalisation and death avoidance were lowest in HI . Hospitel had lower hospitalisation and death rates , although required more expense compared to HI and CI . Thus , cost - benefit anal - ysis or cost - utility analysis for these two strategies might be useful in the future . For clinical outcomes , although hospitalisation rates among hospitel , HI and CI were not clinically significant ( 3 . 72 % , 4 . 07 % and 5 . 38 % , respectively ) , death rate of HI and CI were approximately 5 times higher than hospitel . This might be due to in HI patients had higher proportion of underlying diseases , which also affected disease pro - gression , than hospitel patients . Although similar treat - ment protocol was provided for all isolation strategies , the adherence to protocol of CI patients might be differ - ent relative to HI and hospitel ; this might be due to the CI was operated by local governance under supervision of hospital staffs , whereas patients under HI and hos - pitel were directly followed up by staffs of Ramathibodi Fig . 2 Cost by product type of each isolation strategy Page 8 of 9 Suthutvoravut et al . Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 Hospital . Therefore , difference of care provided to patient might have occurred in the real world situation . Conse - quently , these lead to the higher death rate which was found in CI . For economic aspect , this study’s findings were in line with previous study from Australia , in which HI was shown to be more cost - effective , compared to hos - pitel [ 27 ] . The HI was designed as housing facilities for people with confirmed COVID - 19 , who did not require hospital care , which could reduce in - patient room cost and nursing care cost . HI strategy is demonstrated by its ability to provide good psychological and social sup - port with minimal requirement of logistic support . The majority of patients under HI recovered successfully and only a minority of them ( 4 . 07 % ) required hospitalisation . For CI , most of the expenses were used for reconstruct - ing public building to be temporary shelter . Additionally , fewer patients were suitable for stay in CI . These might lead to higher cost per number of admissions . Moreover , higher deaths in CI might be due to adherence of taking care by local government personnel under hospital pro - tocol which was different from the other 2 strategies , as aforementioned . These lead to higher hospitalisation and deaths . Finally , ICER indicated CI was not cost effective , compared to hospitel and HI . Based on this study’s results , both HI and CI strategies could help to deal with a surge of COVID - 19 infected cases in low and middle income countries like Thailand , where there are limitations of healthcare infrastruc - ture and funding . However , several issues should be addressed . First , categorising severity should be stan - dardised and auditing should be implemented to prevent inappropriate selection of patients to isolation strategies . Second , the concept of infectious controls ( e . g . , isolation area , personal protective equipment , disinfection pro - cess , waste management , etcetera ) should be emphasised and implemented to all kinds of isolations to prevent sec - ondary transmission of disease to household and com - munity members . Third , standard training and testing programs about disease , care process and infectious con - trol should be provided for local government healthcare officers or volunteers or care givers . Finally , intermittent audit should be implemented to ensure that appropriate medical care is provided for patients in CI . As for our knowledge , this study is the first study to compare cost - effectiveness between HI , CI and hospi - tel isolation based on the real world situation in middle income country . However , some limitations were also found . First , this study did not include and consider sec - ondary transmission as the outcomes of interest , because the database contained only patients who were con - firmed as Covid - 19 infections , not other family members who were also infected but might attend other hospitals . This study’s data was from a Southeast Asian country which still lacks the evidence of cost - effective analysis in COVID - 19 measures . Second , this cost - effective analysis was performed based on hospital perspective , not soci - etal perspective ; thus , did not account for other relevant unknown costs such as community preparation , potential side effects and indirect - cost from quarantine , etcetera . The hospital perspective in this study would be helpful for health policy makers to make decisions for invest - ment about quarantine policy during COVID - 19 out - break and prepare for responses to other new emerging diseases . Conclusion This cost - effectiveness analysis provided the insight of isolation strategies for patients with COVID - 19 based on hospital perspective . Cost per isolation is lowest in HI followed by hospitel and CI . The results showed that HI may be a cost - effective isolation measure , both in terms of preventing hospitalisation and death , in developing countries with limited resources . However , some issued should be emphasised including patient monitoring pro - cess , adherence to treatment protocol , and implement - ing infectious controls to prevent secondary household transmission .
