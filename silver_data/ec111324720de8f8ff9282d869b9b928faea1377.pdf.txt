BMC Infectious Diseases The impact of national and international travel on spatio - temporal transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in Belgium in 2021 Minh Hanh Nguyen 1 * † , Thi Huyen Trang Nguyen 1† , Geert Molenberghs 1 , 2 , Steven Abrams 1 , 3 , Niel Hens 1 , 3 , 4 and Christel Faes 1 , 2 Abstract Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has rapidly spread over the world and caused tremendous impacts on global health . Understanding the mechanism responsible for the spread of this pathogen and the impact of specific factors , such as human mobility , will help authorities to tailor interventions for future SARS - CoV - 2 waves or newly emerging airborne infections . In this study , we aim to analyze the spatio - temporal transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in Belgium at municipality level between January and December 2021 and explore the effect of different levels of human travel on disease incidence through the use of counterfactual scenarios . Methods We applied the endemic - epidemic modelling framework , in which the disease incidence decomposes into endemic , autoregressive and neighbourhood components . The spatial dependencies among areas are adjusted based on actual connectivity through mobile network data . We also took into account other important factors such as international mobility , vaccination coverage , population size and the stringency of restriction measures . Results The results demonstrate the aggravating effect of international travel on the incidence , and simulated coun - terfactual scenarios further stress the alleviating impact of a reduction in national and international travel on epidemic growth . It is also clear that local transmission contributed the most during 2021 , and municipalities with a larger population tended to attract a higher number of cases from neighboring areas . Conclusions Although transmission between municipalities was observed , local transmission was dominant . We highlight the positive association between the mobility data and the infection spread over time . Our study provides insight to assist health authorities in decision - making , particularly when the disease is airborne and therefore likely influenced by human movement .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 428 Background The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) and its implied Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) has tremendously impacted global health . Several studies suggested that the transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 are explained by several spatio - temporal factors , including demographic factors [ 1 ] , contact net - works of individuals [ 2 ] , containment measures [ 3 , 4 ] , and human mobility [ 5 , 6 ] . In Belgium , approximately 650 , 000 COVID - 19 - positive cases were confirmed in 2020 , and this number increased to 1 . 5 million confirmed cases over the course of 2021 , accounting for 12 . 9 % of the Belgian population . Cases were heterogeneously distrib - uted across municipalities ( see , e . g . , Fig . 1 ) . Few studies have examined the effects of control strategies and mobil - ity on the spatial spread of COVID - 19 in the country , and these studies have focused on waves in 2020 [ 2 , 7 , 8 ] . A study incorporating spatio - temporal heterogeneous fac - tors ( e . g . , demographic factors , containment measures , human mobility ) is therefore advisable to understand the transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 in Belgium , espe - cially in 2021 . Human mobility has been identified earlier as a quin - tessential factor in the spread of airborne infections [ 9 – 12 ] . Hence , to mitigate SARS - CoV - 2 spread in Belgium , one of the early responses was the installment of severe restrictions on travel , both at the national and interna - tional level . Specifically , international travel was banned during the first wave , March - May 2020 , and non - essen - tial foreign travel to and from Belgium was prohibited between January 27 and April 19 , 2021 . However , being a small , centrally located European country , the relatively large in - flux of travelers - a fraction of which hosting the infection - especially in periods with little or no travel restrictions ( e . g . , from September 2021 ) , potentially has an important impact on viral spread . The human mobility data in Belgium is available at several space - time resolu - tions . In our study , two main sources are used : summary data on national mobility from the mobile network and the number of incoming travelers to the country . As these data reflect changes in mobility patterns at different Fig . 1 Distribution of reported cases by date ( A ) and municipality ( B ) and time - dependent data on international travelers per 100 inhabitants ( C ) , vaccination coverage of at least one dose of COVID - 19 vaccine ( D ) , and stringency index ( E ) in Belgium from Week 2021 - 1 ( 04 / 1 / 2021 ) to Week 2021 - 48 ( 05 / 12 / 2021 ) . Two vertical red lines in ( A ) are to distinguish between the three time periods considered in our analyses : January - May , June - September , and October - December 2021 Page 3 of 13 Nguyen et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 428 time periods , they can be used to describe disease spread . More specifically , the key question arises whether we use the available travel data to quantify the impact of travel on the spread of COVID - 19 , in order to use them as an important factor to simulate and predict the disease inci - dence in different time period . In response to the pandemic , the non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) issued by the Belgian government have changed with time , leading to variations in the strin - gency of restriction measures . In 2021 , relatively strin - gent measures were still in place , but these no longer included lockdown and full school closure , although there were still longer periods with mask mandates ( e . g . , in public transport ) and closure of culture and event sec - tors . A precise estimation of their effects on the evolution of infections is challenging in the face of sparse data avail - ability . Fortunately , the Oxford Coronavirus Government Tracker ( OxCGRT ) provides a proxy metric , the so - called stringency index , to assess the level of strictness of social policies imposed at a national scale [ 13 ] . The stringency index has shown to be useful in recent spatio - temporal studies [ 14 , 15 ] . Furthermore , vaccination campaigns have largely contributed to an important reduction of the risk of infection and of more severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death [ 16 – 19 ] . During 2021 , mass vaccination campaigns were widely implemented in the Belgian population . However , vaccination coverages were heterogeneous across Belgian geographical units ( see , e . g . , Fig . 1D , and Faes et al . ( 2022 ) [ 20 ] ) . For pathogens such as measles , earlier findings indicated that the het - erogeneity in vaccination coverage was associated with disease incidence [ 21 , 22 ] . Notwithstanding , the impact of vaccination and the relation between vaccine uptake in the population and disease incidence may be different between different vaccine - preventable diseases . Besides , given the importance of demographic characteristics , which are known to vary by location and usually available in spatial resolution , it could not be neglected in study - ing the transmission process of COVID - 19 . Therefore , we expect that the combination of space - time available data will help to better unravel the complex dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 , in this paper with a focus on Belgium . Spatio - temporal modelling of infectious disease spread based on routine incidence data has received great inter - est in recent years . In the context of COVID - 19 , various modeling frameworks have been employed . For exam - ple , compartmental models ( e . g . , SEIR , metapopula - tion models ) study the interaction between individuals in communities at different spatial scales [ 2 , 23 ] . Spa - tial and temporal point processes have also been used to study the disease’s dynamics . Additional information like demographics , human mobility , and control meas - ures have been considered as possible factors influencing transmission [ 24 – 26 ] . However , these models can be complex , require high - resolution data that may not always be available ( e . g . , susceptible proportion in com - munities ) , and can be time - consuming to compute . An adequate method is offered by a multivariate time series model in a so - called endemic - epidemic ( EE ) sta - tistical modelling framework introduced by Held et al . ( 2005 ) [ 27 ] . An important aspect is that it employs a common regression framework , and the model’s param - eters can be conveniently estimated using standard optimization techniques , such as maximum likelihood . In essence , the time - space dependence of infections is determined by both background risk independent of the epidemic and auto - regression on past counts of within - and between - geographical units . The flexibility of the EE framework enables us to include potential variables and model their effects on disease dynamics , in both time and space . Properly tailored models have been used to inves - tigate and predict the evolution of the COVID - 19 pan - demic [ 3 , 14 , 15 , 28 ] . In this paper , we examine both temporal and spatial patterns in disease spread and the way their dynamics are influenced by human mobility , the stringency of NPIs , and the effectiveness thereof . We apply the EE modelling framework with the aim to ( i ) analyze the spatio - tem - poral transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in Belgium between January and December 2021 and ( ii ) explore the effect of different levels of human travel on disease incidence through the use of counterfactual scenarios . We leverage the available data on the daily time series for case inci - dence , national mobility between Belgian municipalities , the number of incoming international travelers to the country , the stringency of containment policies , vacci - nation coverage , and demographic variables . This study aims to provide public health authorities with essential information to make informed policy decision for miti - gating the impact of COVID - 19 as well as that of future pandemics , especially in relation to travel restrictions . Methods In this section , we first describe the data sources used in our analyses . A summary of the data used can be found in Table 1 . Then , we introduce a spatial dynamic model to assess the impact of travel rate on COVID - 19 spread . This impact is further illustrated through counterfactual scenarios with different travel levels . Lastly , sensitiv - ity analyses to assess the stability of model estimates are described . Data Case data The daily number of confirmed COVID - 19 cases in each of the 581 municipalities in Belgium was retrieved for Page 4 of 13 Nguyen et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 428 the period between January 4 , 2021 and December 5 , 2021 from Sciensano , the Scientific Institute for Public Health in Belgium . Figure 1A shows the evolution of the Belgian COVID - 19 epidemic during 2021 . More specifi - cally , the total number of reported cases over time shows two waves : ( 1 ) a wave between January and June , 2021 , representing the third COVID - 19 wave in Belgium , and ( 2 ) a wave starting from September 2021 onwards . The daily number of cases started to increase again from July onwards and fluctuated around 2 , 500 confirmed cases before dramatically soaring to approximately 25 , 000 cases per day at the beginning of December . Further - more , the lower left panel ( Fig . 1B ) shows the distribu - tion of confirmed cases by Belgian municipality using heat colors . For areas that are darker , the number of con - firmed cases is higher . National and international mobility data To assess the amount of travel between municipalities in Belgium , summary information from mobile network data is used , available between September 1 , 2020 and June 6 , 2021 [ 29 ] . These data provide information about the average proportion of time that customers spent in their residing municipality as well as in other munici - palities ( if any ) . Based on this , we can present the con - nectivity among municipalities through a mobility matrix ( Fig . 2 ) , calculated as the log - transformed mean percentage time spent in a municipality between Sep - tember 2020 and June 2021 , and averaged this tempo - ral information to obtain a static network . The monthly mobility matrices over this time period are graphically depicted in Fig . A6 in the Appendix . The international travel rate is available at the pro - vincial level as the number of incoming travelers per 100 inhabitants . This information is based on the COVID - 19 weekly reports by Sciensano . Figure 1C shows the time trend over the study period . The rate for all provinces was at the minimum during Febru - ary—April 2021 , when a travel ban on non - essential travel was in place ( from January 27 until April 19 , Table 1 Overview of the different datasets used in the analyses with details on the resolution , spatial level and time range Dataset Resolution Spatial level Time range Case data Daily Municipality Jan 04 - Dec 05 , 2021 Local mobility data Daily Municipality Sep 01 , 2020 - Jun 6 , 2021 Stringency Index Daily National Jan 04 - Dec 05 , 2021 International travel data Weekly Province Week 1 - Week 48 , 2021 Vaccination data Weekly Municipality Week 1 - Week 48 , 2021 Population data Yearly Municipality 2020 Fig . 2 National mobility between September 1 , 2020 and June 6 , 2021 . The y - axis represents the origin while the x - axis is the destination . Different municipalities are grouped according to the 10 Belgian provinces and Brussels - Capital Region ( Brussels ( Br ) , Antwerp ( An ) , Flemish Brabant ( BF ) , Walloon Brabant ( BW ) , West Flanders ( WF ) , East Flanders ( EF ) , Hainaut ( Ha ) , Liège ( Le ) , Limburg ( Lm ) , Luxembourg ( Lu ) , and Namur ( Na ) Page 5 of 13 Nguyen et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 428 2021 ) . After this period , travel rates started to increase , to reach a peak around August and November 2021 . Brussels remained the region with the highest travel rate during 2021 . Pharmaceutical and non‑pharmaceutical interventions The number of individuals that received at least one dose of a COVID - 19 vaccine in 2021 was obtained from Sciensano [ 30 ] ) . Note that these data are avail - able at municipality level and in weekly resolution . The proportion of vaccinated individuals in each Bel - gian province is depicted in Fig . 1D . Differences in vaccine coverage among provinces are clearly visible . West - Flanders had the highest proportion of individu - als receiving at least one vaccine dose , while the lowest level was observed in Brussels . The Stringency Index ranges from 0 to 100 and reflects the level of severity of non - pharmaceutical mit - igation measures imposed at the national level ( Oxford Coronavirus Government Tracker 2022 ) [ 13 ] . It is a composite measure of nine response metrics , including school and workplace closures , cancellation of public events , limitations on public gatherings , closure of or restrictions on public transport , stay - at - home man - dates , public awareness campaigns , restrictions on internal mobility , and international movement con - trol . Higher values of the Stringency Index imply that stricter measures were in place . Figure 1E presents the evolution of this index for Belgium throughout 2021 . The highest values were observed during February – April 2021 , with a peak in April 2021 , at the time of the third wave . Population data The population data of each Belgian municipality in 2020 was retrieved from the Belgian statistical office [ 31 ] . The total population size was approximately 11 . 5 million indi - viduals and was assumed to be constant during 2021 . Spatial dynamic model Let Y it denote the number of confirmed COVID - 19 cases in municipality i ( i = 1 , . . . , 581 ) on day t ( t = 1 , . . . , T ) , with T the length of the time window considered in this analysis . Covariate information is represented by x it . Assuming that the number of new confirmed cases Y it at day t depends on the ( series of ) past observations Y i ( t − d ) , d = 1 , . . . , D , with up to D = 7 days being of importance to determine Y it , the spatio - temporal model is formu - lated as [ 27 , 32 , 33 ] : [ Y it | Y i ( t − 1 ) , . . . , Y i ( t − D ) , x it ] ∼ NegBin ( µ it , ψ ) , with mean incidence µ it and variance µ it ( 1 + ψµ it ) . Here ψ ≥ 0 is the dispersion parameter to be estimated . Note that if ψ = 0 , mean and variance are equal and Y it follows a Poisson distribution . The conditional mean µ it is modelled as : The natural logarithm of the first term , referred to as the endemic component ǫ it , and interpreted as the back - ground risk , equals with N ∗ i = N i / 100 , 000 defining an offset . The second term is the local epidemic or autoregressive component , describing the local epidemic spread in time . The autore - gressive parameter (cid:31) it , is modeled as Finally , the third term of mean µ it represents the global epidemic or neighbourhood component . Its corresponding parameter φ it is modeled as Two types of weights are included in the model . First , the normalized Poisson weights u d in ( 1 ) represent the probability for a serial interval ( i . e . , the average time ( in days ) between symptom onset in an infectious individual and symptoms emerging in a newly infected individual when both were in close contact ) of length d days with d taking values up to D = 7 days [ 33 ] . Second , the weights w ∗ ji in the neighbourhood component express the strength of connectivity between pairs of municipalities . The defi - nition of the mobility weights is based on the estimated connectivity over time inferred from mobility data , and a comparison is made from defining the connectivity merely on the distance between two municipalities .

Page 6 of 13 Nguyen et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 428 In the model , we include component - specific inter - cepts ( α ( ǫ ) , α ( (cid:31) ) , α ( φ ) ) . We account for various covariates , including a weekend effect ( WE ) , population size ( N ) ( in the local and global epidemic components ) , proportion of non - vaccinated individuals as a proxy for susceptibil - ity ( sus ) , travel rate ( travel ) , stringency index ( SI ) , and calendar time ( period ) . Specifically , two time periods , i . e . , from June to September 2021 and from October to December 2021 , are considered in the analysis in order to distinguish between different phases in the epidemic . The effect of the proportion of susceptible individuals ( sus ) is accommodated in the model by considering the natural logarithm of the proportion of residents that are non - vaccinated ( i . e . , the fraction of individuals without any of the COVID - 19 vaccine doses ) [ 21 , 22 ] . We add a quad - ratic term of the travel rate which was centered prior to inclusion in the model . Inference and model comparison Model comparison is done based on the Akaike Informa - tion Criteria ( AIC ) [ 34 ] . The model with the lowest AIC is selected . Parameter inference is based on maximum likelihood estimation in R package surveillance [ 35 ] version 1 . 20 . 1 and hhh4addon version 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 . 9014 [ 33 ] under R version 4 . 0 . 5 [ 36 ] . Counterfactual simulation of case counts To investigate the impact of travel , we consider three scenarios with different levels of travel and simulate the expected number of cases . In the first scenario , the national mobility and international travel rate is the same as observed . In the second one , the international travel rate is set at the lowest level during the study period , while national mobility is kept the same as observed . In the third case , we show what the situation would be if there would be no mobility within the country . Sensitivity analyses In order to check the stability of our model estimates , we performed four sensitivity analyses . First , the travel rate is estimated based on the number of incoming travellers from the Passenger Locator Form ( PLF ) data ( Appendix Fig . A1 ) . This form was required to be filled in by all pas - sengers entering Belgium during the study period . Sec - ond , we use serial intervals based on a literature review . This includes a gamma distribution with shape and rate parameters equal to 2 . 29 and 0 . 36 , respectively [ 37 ] , and a lognormal distribution with parameters 1 . 38 and 0 . 563 [ 38 ] . Third , the Stringency Index was adjusted to exclude travel restrictions ( i . e . , restrictions on internal movement and international travel controls ) ( Appendix Fig . A2 ) , in order to reduce dependencies between the ( original ) Stringency Index versus the national mobil - ity and the international travel rate in our model . Finally , we represent municipality connectivity by a power law matrix instead of mobility matrices [ 39 ] . Results Figure 3 depicts the model fit ( panel ( a ) ) and the contri - bution of each component ( panel ( b ) ) . It can be seen that our model provides a good overall fit to the observed epi - demic curve . Nevertheless , the estimated case numbers from around November onward are not as close to the observed data points as in the previous period . This may result as a result of the emergence of the Omicron vari - ant , which started circulating in Belgium from December 2021 onward . The relative contribution of each compo - nent to the estimated daily number of cases is illustrated Fig . 3 The left panel ( a ) shows the fitted components of the selected model on COVID - 19 cases in Belgium ; the dots indicate the observed number of daily confirmed cases . The right panel ( b ) depicts the proportions of transmission that can be attributed to each of the three components ( i . e . , endemic , autoregressive and neighbourhood ) Page 7 of 13 Nguyen et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 428 in the right panel of the same figure . The local epidemic spread component usually accounts for the largest part of the circulation , throughout the study period . A sudden increase in the share of the global spread was observed in June - September 2021 . Overall , the endemic , local epidemic and global epidemic components accounted for 15 . 8 % , 73 . 9 % , and 10 . 3 % of the estimated cumulative number of cases , respectively . The exponentiated model parameters , represent - ing the multiplicative effect at the original scale , with their 95 % confidence intervals , are presented in Table 2 . As expected , the number of confirmed cases in week - ends is lower as compared to weekdays due to report - ing delays , under - reporting , or delays in health - seeking behaviour . Municipalities with a larger population size have a stronger spatial epidemic spread while its effect on within - municipality epidemic spread is found to be insignificant . An increase in the proportion of suscepti - ble individuals ( as approximated by the fraction of non - vaccinated individuals ) tends to lead to an increase in the number of confirmed cases , albeit that the effect is also insignificant . Interestingly , implementation of stricter measures is associated with a higher disease spread even though the effect is minimal . The two periods ( i . e . , June to September , 2021 and October to December , 2021 ) show different effects ( compared to the reference period January to May , 2021 ) in each of the three model com - ponents . Both periods have a lower mean baseline inci - dence as compared to the first period ( January to May , 2021 ) . In the period of June to September , the speed of local spread is reduced as compared to in the reference period , while in the period October to December it increases again to a level which is higher than January to May , 2021 . At the same time , the speed of disease spread between municipalities is elevated in the period of June to September as compared to the period of January to May , and not significantly different between the period of October to December and the period of January to May . Similar results are observed in the sensitivity analyses . The impact of travel rate on the mean number of cases is visualized in Fig . 4 . Note that since the travel rate is centered , a value of zero on the x - axis corresponds to the mean travel rate on the original scale . From Fig . 4 , it can be seen that the baseline circulation of COVID - 19 gets higher if there is more international travel , and in addition that the spatial spread is higher when inter - national travel increases . Indeed , in the endemic and neighbourhood components the baseline mean incidence ( assuming a mean centered travel rate of zero ) increases multiplicatively with a factor evolving in a non - linear way in relation to the travel rate , while the opposite ( although albeit small ) effect holds for the autoregressive compo - nent ( red line ) . Furthermore , for large travel rates the increase in multiplicative effect with increasing travel rates stabilizes in the endemic case ( green line ) , thereby deviating from an exponential increase in case of a linear travel rate term at the linear predictor scale . The comparison between the estimated lag distribu - tion from our model and from literature is illustrated in Fig . 5 . This lag distribution reflects the distribution of the serial interval ( i . e . , the time between symptom onset days of two paired cases ) . Parameter estimates from using an alternative definition of the mobility matrix , the adjusted Stringency Index , and from fixing the serial intervals are given in Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix , respectively . Similar conclusions are found in these analyses . Figure 6 illustrates the impact of travel by means of three simulated scenarios for three periods : 18 January to 25 April ( period 1 ) , 26 April to 29 August ( period 2 ) and 30 August to 5 December ( period 3 ) . In the first sce - nario ( travel rate as observed ) , the simulation was able to capture the observed epidemic curve despite a slight Table 2 The exponentiated model parameter estimates with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) Local epidemic Global epidemic Endemic Estimate 95 % CI Estimate 95 % CI Estimate 95 % CI Intercept 0 . 78 0 . 68 0 . 89 0 . 03 0 . 02 0 . 05 4 . 73 3 . 67 6 . 09 Weekend 0 . 32 0 . 31 0 . 32 0 . 87 0 . 80 0 . 94 0 . 35 0 . 33 0 . 37 Population 0 . 99 0 . 98 1 . 00 1 . 14 1 . 10 1 . 19 - - - Susceptible proportion 1 . 00 0 . 98 1 . 03 - - - 1 . 05 0 . 98 1 . 12 Travel rate 1 . 03 1 . 01 1 . 05 1 . 23 1 . 15 1 . 31 1 . 51 1 . 44 1 . 59 Travel rate 2 0 . 97 0 . 97 0 . 98 1 . 00 0 . 99 1 . 02 0 . 94 0 . 92 0 . 96 Stringency Index 1 . 00 1 . 00 1 . 01 1 . 01 1 . 01 1 . 02 1 . 01 1 . 01 1 . 02 Month Jun - Sep 0 . 88 0 . 85 0 . 92 2 . 01 1 . 70 2 . 36 0 . 29 0 . 27 0 . 31 Month Oct - Dec 1 . 45 1 . 39 1 . 52 1 . 09 0 . 91 1 . 32 0 . 80 0 . 71 0 . 89 AIC 754224 . 7 Page 8 of 13 Nguyen et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 428 underestimation in period 1 and overestimation in period 2 as compared to the observed cases ( 93 . 9 % and 114 % , respectively ) . In the second scenario ( reduced interna - tional travel ) and third scenario ( reduced national travel ) , the simulation clearly shows that restricting international travel and local mobility would greatly reduce the epidemic growth . No connectivity among municipalities would imply the largest effect on the spread in period 1 , whereas in period 2 and 3 , minimizing incoming international travelers would be the most effective . Specifically , a travel rate fixed to the minimum level that was observed would have prevented 11 . 4 % of cases in period 1 up to 68 . 3 % in period 3 . When there is no connectivity among municipali - ties , we also observe a decrease in cases with the largest Fig . 4 Impact of travel rate ( proportion of incoming travelers per 100 population , centered ) on the number of cases .

Discussion Using the endemic - epidemic modelling framework , we performed a detailed analysis concerning the spatio - temporal characteristics of the COVID - 19 pandemic at municipality level in Belgium . We successfully inves - tigated the impact of different levels of human mobility , both between municipalities as well as by incoming trav - ellers , on the daily incidence during 2021 , while consider - ing important covariates , such as vaccination on the one hand , and the Stringency Index as a proxy for the effect of NPIs that are in place . From the model results , we conclude that a relatively high fraction of cases originated from local transmission within the municipality itself , suggesting that endogenous transmission contributed the most to the COVID - 19 epi - demic , at least during 2021 . The spatio - temporal contri - bution was relatively low in the earlier part of the year . However , it increased during summer , the time when travel related policies became less stringent , suggesting that a larger fraction of cases during this period were imported from other areas . In certain municipalities , the progression of the disease remained local , though an elevated contribution of the neighbourhood component was visible in a part of the Brussels Capital Region , espe - cially in the second half of the year ( Appendix Fig . A3 ) . This is plausible since intensive connectivity between municipalities on the one hand and a higher fraction of incoming travelers per capita were observed in the Brus - sels Capital Region .

In each simulation , the lower and upper lines represent the pointwise 2 . 5 % and 97 . 5 % simulation - based percentiles for each day ; the middle line displays the mean values Page 10 of 13 Nguyen et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 428 It is suggested that differences in levels of travel played a role on daily confirmed cases . This hypothesis was confirmed by constructing three counterfactual sce - narios , each with a different level of mobility . Reducing the mobility of individuals in the second and third coun - terfactual scenario corresponded with an attenuated COVID - 19 case growth . Previous studies have investi - gated the relationship between disease data and human movement , but these studies were more focused on the areal mobility matrices , which illustrate the origin – des - tination connectivity between geographical units [ 1 , 12 , 40 – 42 ] . Our work is one of a few studies that account for mobility patterns outside of the study settings , as a potential source of infection [ 43 , 44 ] . Nevertheless , regardless of the transmission model applied , the reduc - tion on travel is effective in reducing the spread and size of epidemics . While using aggregated mobility flows can help estimating reductions in incidence at the popula - tion level , it would be intriguing to examine the patterns of spread influenced by changes in individual - level travel behaviors . While not without challenges in data acqui - sition , one might take into account the finer resolution of mobility data that involves information on individual contacts or clustering patterns . Adopting these mobility and travel behaviors may benefit to identify disease hot - spots , adapt appropriate local - level regulations and con - trol strategies . From the estimated model coefficients , we found strong evidence of commuter - driven spread when we accounted for the unit - specific population in the neigh - bourhood component , indicating that regions with a larger population are expected to attract a bigger num - ber of cases from their neighbors . The existence of such an agglomeration effect was also confirmed in previ - ous studies [ 14 , 15 , 22 , 45 ] . We identify that vaccination coverage of the first dose in Belgium did not have a sig - nificant association with fewer case counts . In endemic - epidemic models of areal count time series ( so - called hhh4 models within the surveillance package in R ) , the rate of disease diffusion is allowed to be proportional to the number of susceptible people , which can be inferred from the number of non - vaccinated individuals [ 21 ] . In our study , only the local coverage of the first COVID - 19 vaccine dose was used in the model . The uncertainty about the true immunity levels in the population inferred from one - dose coverage should be noted . By including the proportion of unvaccinated individuals in the model , we assumed that the susceptibility level in the population over time is proportionate to the time - varying proportion of unvaccinated individuals . More specifically , immu - nity in unvaccinated individuals as a result of previous infection with SARS - CoV - 2 would imply an overestima - tion of the time - varying susceptibility at the population level when solely informed by vaccination coverage . However , when assuming that a constant fraction of unvaccinated individuals has immunity within the study period ( and if waning of ( vaccine - induced ) immunity is limited ) , the fraction of unvaccinated individuals is pro - portional to population susceptibility . We acknowledge that this is a strong assumption and an investigation of the sensitivity of our results with regard to this assump - tion is considered a topic for future research . Besides , for a disease such as measles , the assumption that depletion of susceptibles due to vaccination decreases the trans - mission risk is a plausible one , but it arguably does not hold for COVID - 19 given waning of humoral immunity with time since vaccination , the need for a second dose to maintain high protection against severe disease and the fact that vaccination does not completely prevent infection . Given age - specific differences in the fraction of the population that is protected against SARS - CoV - 2 infection due to prior exposure or vaccination [ 46 , 47 ] , an age - stratified model would be a better approach to evaluate the impact of vaccination on the disease dynam - ics . To our surprise , we found that the positive associa - tion between stringency of NPIs and the new cases was not significant . Although recent studies indicated that this factor significantly contributed to the lower trans - mission of cases [ 14 , 15 ] , such a beneficial effect was not observed in this context . One possible reason is that the Stringency Index provides a surrogate picture of control measures by assigning one estimated value for the entire Belgian population . A more granular perspective would provide additional information about the role and impact of NPIs in controlling the epidemic . For example , it would be interesting to replace the Stringency Index with local - level indices to investigate the impact of NPIs . Fur - thermore , compliance to intervention measures and its variation across Belgium is not captured by this measure . Stringency should ideally be combined with informa - tion on adherence to NPIs and with social contact data . In this way , studying the impact of NPIs on space - time spread of the virus is a relevant topic of further research , conditional on the availability of sufficient data . Another aspect that may contribute to this controversial result is the fact that we used a lag of 7 days in the model . It might be unlikely that the impact of control measures in reduc - ing transmission will be noticeable within a week , as it may take 9 - 12 days or longer to manifest in the trajectory of the epidemics [ 40 ] . Additional research could investi - gate the correlation between the delayed effects of NPIs and changes in disease incidence , for example , by exam - ining the rate of change in reproductive number [ 48 ] . Furthermore , we discovered that by fitting a model with the Stringency Index , excluding travel restrictions , we found that dependencies between the Stringency Index Page 11 of 13 Nguyen et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 428 versus the national mobility and the international travel rate in our model had minimal influence on model esti - mates . The results of this sensitivity analysis are shown in Table A2 in the Appendix . During our study period , the Alpha variant was most prevalent over the largest part of the first half of 2021 , while the Delta variant was dominant in the second half of the year . Although the Beta and Gamma variants were concomitantly identified over the first half of 2021 , they did not play an important role in subsequent waves of SARS - CoV - 2 variants observed in Belgium [ 30 , 49 ] . Fur - thermore , previous studies have shown that both the Alpha and Delta variants have 50 % - 70 % higher trans - missibility compared to the pre - existing variants , and they impacted individuals with similar demographic and comorbidity characteristics [ 49 , 50 ] . The emergence of variants of concern ( VOCs ) such as Alpha and Delta vari - ants , which are capable of immune evasion in different molecular mechanisms , may suggest different transmis - sion risks . Adeyinka et al . , 2022 suggested that the eval - uation of the spread of VOCs should account for other factors such as vaccine uptake , the strength of control measures that are in place , and mobility patterns [ 51 ] . However , due to the small size of Belgium as a country , significant geographical variation in the prevalence of VOCs across different provinces is unlikely , as least dur - ing our study period - even though there may be some regional differences . Moreover , our model considered different time periods that did not precisely align with the periods when certain VOCs became more domi - nant . Although it was feasible to adjust the time periods to match , this did not lead to improvement in the model , but rather provoked convergency issue . Therefore , the findings of this study should be interpreted while bearing in mind these VOCs . A notable strength of our modelling strategy is that we were able to mine the mobile network activity to establish the spatial dependence of COVID - 19 trans - mission . Mobility data has gradually shown its poten - tial and importance in ( spatial ) analyses of infectious diseases [ 1 , 24 , 40 , 43 ] . Our study has underscored its usefulness in modelling the connectivity between munic - ipalities . In other words , they allow the modeller to con - struct between - municipality weights . Although a power law , which describes the short - time human movement behavior when there is missing information about travel , improved model fit in terms of AIC ( Appendix Table A2 ) , it makes more sense to apply the mobile network data to the model as it reflects the “true” activity logs of indi - viduals geographically . In addition , we used the daily case counts and used observations to 7 days back in time . This allowed us to avoid biases in serial interval assump - tions when using the aggregated data ( in weekly data , for example ) [ 33 ] . The estimated lag distribution in our study was in line with findings in the studies of Grimée et al . ( 2022 ) and Ssentongo et al . ( 2021 ) [ 3 , 14 ] . The sensitiv - ity analyses with different literature - based serial intervals also showed moderate stability of our results . Further - more , the covariates used in the model ( e . g . , travel rate , vaccine coverage , stringency index ) were time - varying . This approach is particularly important in the context of COVID - 19 , where policies and interventions tend to be highly variable , potentially over short periods of time . Several limitations need to be mentioned . First , our mobile network data was not collected during the whole study period . This may lessen the representative qual - ity for the human activity logs in the time period under investigation . Besides , we used a static spatially - depend - ent network to capture the interaction between locali - ties rather than the time - dependent connectivity matrix , which may better describe the commuting behavior of individuals . Second , we assumed a homogeneous mixing scenario , which prevents us from examining the interac - tion between individuals in disease spread . Endeavors have been made to clarify the transmission dynamics in subgroups ( age , gender ) using social contact data [ 52 – 54 ] . Nowadays , such disease - related data and data on human behavior are collected and stored more systemati - cally with high resolution and subject to specific circum - stances . Future extensions of the EE framework would ideally address some or all of these limitations . Conclusions In conclusion , our research focus centered on capturing the COVID - 19 diffusion at municipality level in Belgium through a space - time dynamic model and identifying covariates that serve as contributing factors to the virus spread . Even though transmission between municipalities was observed during the study period , local transmission was dominant . We highlighted the positive association between the mobility data and the infection spread over time . Insight from our study can assist in decisions of public health policies , particularly when the disease is likely influenced by human movement .
