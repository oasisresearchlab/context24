Among the characterized ADF / coﬁlin proteins , TgADF has the shortest length and is missing a C - terminal helix implicated in F - actin binding . In order to understand its characteristic properties , we have determined the solution structure of TgADF and studied its back - bone dynamics from 15 N - relaxation measurements . TgADF has conserved ADF / coﬁlin fold consisting of a central mixed b - sheet comprised of six b - strands that are partially surrounded by three a - helices and a C - terminal helical turn . The high G - actin sequestering activity of TgADF relies on highly structurally and dynamically optimized interactions between G - actin and G - actin binding surface of TgADF . The equi - librium dissociation constant for TgADF and rabbit muscle G - actin was 23 . 81 nM , as measured by ITC , which reﬂects very strong afﬁnity of TgADF and G - actin interactions . The F - actin binding site of TgADF is partially formed , with a shortened F - loop that does not project out of the ellipsoid structure and a C - terminal helical turn in place of the C - terminal helix a 4 . Yet , it is more rigid than the F - actin binding site of Leishmania donovani coﬁlin . Experimental observations and structural features do not support the interaction of PIP2 with TgADF , and PIP2 does not affect the interaction of TgADF with G - actin . Overall , this study suggests that conformational ﬂexibility of G - actin binding sites enhances the afﬁnity of TgADF for G - actin , while conformational rigidity of F - actin binding sites of conventional ADF / coﬁlins is neces - sary for stable binding to F - actin .

Introduction The proteins of the ADF / coﬁlin family are one of the key regula - tors of actin ﬁlament dynamics and have been shown to be essen - tial for several eukaryotes ( Ono , 2007 ) . ADF / coﬁlin proteins increase the turnover rate of actin ﬁlaments by accelerating the dissociation of actin monomers from the ﬁlament pointed end . In addition , F - actin ﬁlaments are actively severed by several mem - bers of the ADF / coﬁlin family proteins , leading to the generation of new uncapped barbed ends that immediately start growing . The ADF / coﬁlin proteins manifest their activity through G - actin binding ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) , F - actin binding and depolymer - ization ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) , F - actin severing ( Andrianantoan - dro and Pollard , 2006 ) , controlling the rate of nucleotide exchange from actin monomer ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 , Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden , et al . 1993 ; Nishida , 1985 ; Yamashi - ro et al . , 2005 ) , and actin monomer sequestering activity ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Mehta and Sibley , 2010 ; Nachmias , 1993 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2005 ) . ADF / coﬁlin proteins show pH sensitivity that is more pronounced in case of the vertebrates than other eukaryotes . The F - actin depolymerizing activity ( Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ) of ADF / coﬁlin proteins is higher at pH (cid:2) 8 compared to pH (cid:2) 6 . 8 ( Pope et al . , 2004 ) . However , the activity of ADF / coﬁlin from Leishmania donovani and Toxoplasma gondii are pH independent ( Mehta and Sibley , 2010 ; Tammana et al . , 2008 ) . The non - vertebrate ADF / coﬁlins represent the highly conserved ADF - homology ( ADF - H ) fold , which is also observed in destrin , actophorin , and gelsolin . The structure of 143 residues Saccharomy - ces cerevisiae coﬁlin consists of a six stranded mixed b - sheet , in which the four central strands are anti - parallel while the two edge strands run parallel to the neighboring strands . The b - sheet is sandwiched between a pair of a - helices on each face . The longest helix ( a 3 ) is kinked at the position of a serine residue in a con - served segment . ADF / coﬁlins have two distinct actin - binding sites . These have been named as the G / F - site and the F - site ( Ono , 2003 ) . The G / F - site of ADF / coﬁlins is required for binding to both the G - actin and the F - actin . This binding site corresponds to helix a 3 ( long kinked helix ) , the N - terminal ﬂexible region , the strand b 5 , and the loop before the C - terminal helix ( a 4 ) ( Paavilainen et al . , 1047 - 8477 / $ - see front matter (cid:2) 2011 Elsevier Inc .

The F - site is responsible for binding to F - actin and F - actin severing activity . In conventional ADF / coﬁlins , the F - site is com - prised of the b 3 – b 4 loop , also called the ‘F - loop’ , C - terminal helix ( helix a 4 ) , and the C - terminus . The F - loop typically projects out of the structure and is predicted to intercalate within the actin ﬁl - ament . Sites of ADF / coﬁlin involved in actin binding have been conﬁrmed by several mutational analysis ( Moriyama and Yahara , 1999 ; Moriyama et al . , 1992 ) , cross - linking ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991a , b ) , and peptide competition or synchrotron electron foot - printing ( Guan et al . , 2002 ) . The G / F - actin binding sites and the F - actin binding sites cluster together in the three - dimensional structure ( Fedorov et al . , 1997 ; Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ; Pope et al . , 2000 ) to constitute respective actin binding surfaces . Vertebrate coﬁlins are (cid:2) 160 residues long and in comparison to non - vertebrate subgroup , these have two sequence inserts and an extension of C - terminus . In chick coﬁlin , human coﬁlin , and des - trin , the ﬁrst insert is an additional segment bearing helix ( a 2 ) , in between a 1 and b 2 , which contains a putative nuclear localiza - tion sequence ( NLS ) . A second seven residue insert follows b 3 . In chick coﬁlin , this insert forms a bulge followed by an additional b - strand that pairs with the N - terminal end of b 2 and expands the central b sheet scaffold ( Gorbatyuk et al . , 2006 ) . Vertebrate ADF / coﬁlins also contain a C - terminal extension of approximately eight residues . In chick coﬁlin , this extension forms a b - hairpin comprising antiparallel strands b 7 and b 8 that nestle between b 4 and a 6 ( Gorbatyuk et al . , 2006 ) . The sequence of the C - terminal extension may be unique to vertebrate coﬁlins and it may impart unique F - actin binding properties . Various activities of ADF / coﬁlin family proteins have been shown to be dependent on the afﬁnity of these proteins for the ac - tin ﬁlaments . It has been observed in the case of the human coﬁlin that a point mutation of a basic residue K96 in the F - loop leads to a loss of severing activity and increased depolymerizing activity ( Pope et al . , 2000 ) . Similarly it has been reported that by mutation , in the F - actin binding sites of ADF / coﬁlin proteins , severing and depolymerizing activities can be uncoupled ( Ono et al . , 1999 , 2001 ; Pope et al . , 2000 ) . In the case of Schizosaccharomyces pombe coﬁlin , it has been found that the point mutation of R78 in the F - loop resulted in a loss of nucleating activity ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Intracellular protozoan parasites that belong to the phylum Api - complexa are a signiﬁcant cause of disease in humans and animals ( Joynson and Wreghitt , 2001 ) . Apicomplexa parasites utilize a un - ique mode of motility , termed gliding , to move across epithelial barriers and translocate into the host cytoplasm ( Barragan and Sibley , 2003 ) . Gliding motility is conserved across the Apicom - plexa , is dependent on the turnover of actin ﬁlaments , and is inhib - ited by treatment of the parasites with cytochalasin D ( Dobrowolski and Sibley , 1996 ) . Although , Apicomplexa actins characterized so far exhibit high sequence homology to the verte - brate actins , they are in contrast typically inherently unstable ( Sa - hoo et al . , 2006 ; Schmitz et al . , 2005 ; Schuler et al . , 2005 ) , have signiﬁcantly lower critical concentration for polymerization ( Sahoo et al . , 2006 ) , and yet are almost exclusively unpolymerized in the cytoplasm ( Dobrowolski et al . , 1997 ; Sahoo et al . , 2006 ; Wetzel et al . , 2003 ) . For example , 98 % of actin is present as G - actin in T . gondii ( Dobrowolski et al . , 1997 ; Sahoo et al . , 2006 ; Wetzel et al . , 2003 ) , in comparison to higher eukaryotes where up to 50 % cellular actin is in the ﬁlament form . Despite the presence of G - actin in high cellular concentration , formation and turnover of ﬁlamentous actin is essential for both gliding motility and the host cell invasion by T . gondii ( Poupel and Tardieux , 1999 ; Shaw and Tilney , 1999 ; Wetzel et al . , 2003 ) . T . gondii expresses a conserved homolog of the ADF / coﬁlin fam - ily ( TgADF ) that has been shown to play a critical role in actin monomer sequestering and ﬁlament disassembly ( Mehta and Sibley , 2010 ) . TgADF does not co - sediment with actin ﬁlaments . However , it does disassemble actin ﬁlaments in pH independent manner but does not form a stable association with actin ﬁlaments . TgADF possesses low severing activity , but it inhibits nucleation and polymerization , primarily due to sequestering of actin monomers . The genomes of Apicomplexa T . gondii , Eimeria tenella , and Neos - pora caninum express ADF / coﬁlin proteins that are only 118 resi - dues in length . In these ADF / coﬁlin proteins , the G / F - actin binding sites are signiﬁcantly conserved , but there are signiﬁcant deletions of residues that are required to form the sites for binding F - actin . Speciﬁcally , these apicomplexan ADF / coﬁlins possess a truncated C - terminus and lack the C - terminal charged residues that are predicted as necessary to bind to F - actin . The F - loop is it - self much shorter and lacks the conserved basic residue for interac - tion with F - actin . Plasmodium contains two members of the ADF / coﬁlin family . In Plasmodium falciparum , the larger of the two , termed as PfADF2 , is a 143 residue protein which is closer to the conventional yeast type ADF / coﬁlin ( Schüler et al . , 2005 ) . The shorter ADF , termed as PfADF1 , consists of 122 residues , and clo - sely resembles ADF from the other apicomplexans described above . The shorter apicomplexan TgADF protein is among the smallest of the ADF / coﬁlin family and has not been structurally characterized so far . In our present study , we have determined the solution struc - ture of TgADF using NMR spectroscopy . Further , we have mea - sured backbone 15 N - relaxation rates and have analyzed the dynamics of TgADF in solution using the Lipari – Szabo formalism . We have also determined the thermodynamic parameters charac - terizing the interaction of TgADF with rabbit muscle ADP – G - actin using isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) . We also examined the effect of dioctanoyl phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) , on TgADF itself , and on binding of TgADF to rabbit muscle ADP – G - actin , using ITC and NMR experiments . In order to better understand the structure – function relationship , we have docked the solution structure of TgADF on the crystal structure of G - actin monomer . The docking study has provided us with important in - sights into the dynamic regulation of structural interaction that lead to high afﬁnity interactions between TgADF and G - actin interactions . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Preparation of NMR samples The TgADF protein is composed of 118 amino acid residues with an additional N - terminal twenty - one residue puriﬁcation tag mak - ing the molecular weight of the tagged protein equal to 15 , 480 Da . TgADF was cloned by Mehta and Sibley ( 2010 ) . The clone was over - expressed in BL21 ( k DE3 ) strain of Escherichia coli . Conditions for optimal over - expression and puriﬁcation were standardized . The yield of puriﬁed protein was 30 mg / L of culture medium . For isoto - pic labeling , over - expressed TgADF was standardized in minimal media containing 15 N - ammonium sulfate and 13 C - glucose ( CIL , MA , USA ) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources , respectively . The additional twenty - one residue puriﬁcation tag was cleaved by Factor Xa protease at site IEGR according to the manufacturer’s guidelines . NMR samples of 13 C / 15 N - labeled TgADF were prepared at con - centration of approximately 0 . 8 mM in NMR buffer ( 20 mM so - dium phosphate pH 6 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 1 % NaN 3 , and 1 mM AEBSF ) containing 95 % H 2 O / 5 % 2 H 2 O . Dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 sample was prepared in G - actin buffer ( 2 . 0 mM HEPES , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ADP , 1 . 0 mM NaN 3 , 1 . 0 mM BME , pH 7 . 4 ) at a concentration of 1 mg / mL ( 1 . 34 mM ) . 98 R . Yadav et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 176 ( 2011 ) 97 – 111 15 N - labeled TgADF was added to this sample for a ﬁnal concentra - tion of 0 . 1 mM for recording the 1D and 2D spectra of TgADF in presence of dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . 2 . 2 . NMR spectral assignments The following experiments were acquired using Varian Biopack package : two - dimensional 15 N – 1 H - HSQC , and three - dimensional HNCACB ( Wittekind and Mueller , 1993 ) , CBCA ( CO ) NH ( Grzesiek and Bax , 1992 ) HNCO , HNCA ( Kay et al . , 1990 ) , HN ( CA ) CO ( Clubb et al . , 1992 ) , H ( CCO ) NH - TOCSY ( Montelione , et . al . , 1992 ) , ( H ) C ( CO ) NH - TOCSY ( Grzesiek et al . , 1993 ) , HCCH - TOCSY ( Bax et al . , 1990 ) and 15 N - edited NOESY HSQC ( s mix (cid:3) 100 ms ) , HBHA ( CBCACO ) NH , 2D - 13 C – 1 H - HSQC ( aliphatic ) , 13 C – 1 H - HSQC ( aromatic ) , HB ( CBCGCE ) HE , and HB ( CBCGCD ) HD . All spectra were collected at 298 K on Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with actively shielded Z - gradient triple resonance Cold probe . Spectra were processed by using the software NMRPipe ( Delaglio et al . , 1995 ) and analyzed by CARA - 1 . 8 . 4 ( Keller , 2005 ) . The NMR data was referenced for 1 H chemical shifts by using 2 , 2 - dimethyl - 2 - silapentane - 5 - sulfonic acid ( DSS ) at 298 K as a standard . The 13 C and 15 N chemical shift were referenced indi - rectly . All NMR experiments were collected at 25 (cid:3) C . The chemical shifts have been deposited in the BioMagResBank ( http : / / www . bmrb . wisc . edu ) under accession number 17278 . 2 . 3 . Structure calculations Distance restraints were obtained from 3D 15 N - edited NOESY - HSQC spectra ( s mix (cid:3) 150 ms ) , 13 C - edited NOESY - HSQC ( s mix (cid:3) 100 ms and 180 ms ) , and 13 C ( aromatic ) - edited NOESY - HSQC spectra ( s mix (cid:3) 100 ms ) . All the spectra were processed using NMR - Pipe ( Delaglio et al . , 1995 ) and all NOE were assigned manually using CARA - 1 . 8 . 4 ( Keller , 2005 ) . Integrated NOE peaks were cali - brated and converted to distance restraints with the program CALI - BA ( Guntert et al . , 1991 ) . In the ﬁnal structural determination , the program CYANA - 3 . 0 ( Guntert et al . , 1997 ) was used . The torsion angle restraints were obtained from assigned backbone chemical shifts using the program TALOS + ( Shen et al . , 2009 ) . A total of 200 randomized conformers were generated and 20 conformers with lowest target function with no distance violation > 0 . 5 Å and no angle violations were selected . These 20 structures with lowest target function were further subjected to molecular dynamics sim - ulation in explicit water with NMR derived distance restraints and angle restraints using the CNS 1 . 21 program ( Brunger et al . , 1998 ) and the standard water shell reﬁnement protocol ( Jung et al . , 2005 ; Linge et al . , 2003 ) . At this stage the distances were relaxed and in addition to this v 2 angles were included for LEU and LYS residues . The v 2 angles for LEU and LYS residues were kept in the range between 120 (cid:3) and 90 (cid:3) . This step improved the Ramachandran plot statistics and also the Z - score for the Procheck ( phi – psi ) and Procheck ( all ) for the ordered residues . The programs CING and PSVS v1 . 4 ( http : / / www . psvs - 1 _ 4 . nesg . org ) were used to analyze the quality of the structures . The program PYMOL ( http : / / pymol . sourceforge . net / ) was used for generating ﬁgures for struc - tures . The charged surface was generated by using program GRASP ( Nicholls et al . , 1991 ) . 2 . 4 . Relaxation measurements All relaxation experiments were recorded on uniformly 15 N - la - beled 0 . 8 mM N - terminal truncated TgADF sample . The spin – lattice R 1 rate measurements were conducted with relaxation delays of 0 , 10 , 70 , 110 , 190 , 280 , 450 , 610 , 890 , 1100 , and 1330 ms . The spin – spinrelaxationmeasurements R 2 weredonewithCarr – Purcell – Mei - boom – Gill delays of 10 , 30 , 50 , 70 , 90 , 130 , 170 , 190 , and 230 ms . Duplicate 1 H – 15 N HSQC spectra were recorded for every relaxation delay value for both R 1 and R 2 data . The relaxation rates for both R 1 and R 2 were determined from the decay of the intensity of each 1 H – 15 N crosspeaks in this series of spectra . All of the relaxation parameters , along with the { 1 H } – 15 N nuclear Overhauser effect ( NOE ) intensities for backbone 15 N nuclei , were measured at 25 (cid:3) C , at a magnetic ﬁeld strength of 14 . 1 T ( corresponding to the reso - nance frequency of 599 . 721 MHz for 1 H ) . All the relaxation data were acquired with 96 (cid:4) 1024 ( t 1 (cid:4) t 2 ) complex points and spectral width of 2309 . 493 Hz and 8401 . 596 Hz , respectively . The R 1 and R 2 values were obtained by using the program Curveﬁt . The errors in individual R 1 and R 2 measurements were estimated by Monte Carlo simulations . The steady state heteronuclear { 1 H } – 15 N NOE values wereobtainedbyrecordingspectrawithandwithoutprotonpresat - uration period ( 3 s ) applied before the start of the 1 H – 15 N HSQC experiment . The heteronuclear 15 N relaxation parameters R 1 , R 2 , and the steady state heteronuclear { 1 H } – 15 N NOE values were ana - lyzed by model - free formalism as described earlier ( Clore et al . , 1990 ; Lipari , and Szabo , 1982a , b ; Mandel et al . , 1995 ) . For model - free analysis , the N – H bond length was assumed to be 1 . 02 Å and 15 N chemical shift anisotropy value of – 160 ppm was considered . The uncertainties in R 1 and R 2 were set to an upper limit of 3 % and 5 % , respectively . While the uncertainties in steady state heteronu - clear { 1 H } – 15 N NOE were ﬁxed at 0 . 05 . R 1 , R 2 , and steady state heter - onuclear { 1 H } – 15 N NOE were subjected to model - free analysis ( Mandel et al . , 1995 ; Palmer et al . , 1991 ; Pulavarti et al . , 2008 ; Roger and Loria , 2003 ) . The dynamic parameters were extracted by using ﬁvesimplemodelsasproposedbyPalmerandco - workersusingMod - elfree4 . 1program ( Palmeretal . , 1991 ) . Themodelsconsideredwere : ( 1 ) S 2 only , s e & R ex are negligible ; ( 2 ) S 2 and s e only , R ex is negligible ; ( 3 ) model 1 and R ex term ; ( 4 ) model 2 and R ex term ; ( 5 ) incorporation of an additional order parameter for anisotropic rotational diffusion . The ratio of principal components of inertia tensor , calculated using the software Pdbinertia ( http : / / biochemistry . hs . colum - bia . edu / labs / palmer / software / pdbinertia . html ) , for the solution structure with lowest target function was found to be 1 . 0 : 0 . 79 : 0 . 66 , suggesting that the molecule could be diffusing in an axially symmetric manner . Therefore , the ﬁtting of the residues to different models of Modelfree was done separately with the iso - tropic diffusion tensor and the axially symmetric diffusion tensor . The calculated D - ratio ( D - ratio = 1 . 18 ) value indicates small anisot - ropy which might represent an intermediate state between isotro - pic and axially symmetric diffusion tensor . However , the relaxation data is well described by an isotropic diffusion tensor . A ﬁnal opti - mization of R 1 , R 2 , and steady state heteronuclear { 1 H } – 15 N NOE value for the residues that were assigned to any of the ﬁve mo - tional models yielded s m = 6 . 20 ± 0 . 02 ns . 2 . 5 . Isothermal titration calorimetry ITC experiments were performed at 25 (cid:3) C on a VP - ITC calorim - eter from MicroCal™ ( Northampton , MA , USA ) . The calorimeter was calibrated according to the user manual of the instrument . All the samples were brieﬂy centrifuged and then degassed for 20 min before each of the ITC experiments . Titrations were per - formed at least in duplicate using the same set of stock solutions . The ITC experiments were performed by adding aliquots of ligands to rabbit muscle actin . The rabbit muscle actin for the experiments was prepared as mentioned earlier ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ; Pathak et al . , 2010 ) . Stock solution of TgADF and rabbit muscle ac - tin were dialyzed extensively against the HEPES buffer ( G - actin buffer ) ( 2 . 0 mM HEPES , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ADP , 1 . 0 mM NaN 3 , 1 . 0 mM BME , pH 7 . 4 ) . The sample cell was ﬁlled with 1 . 459 mL of 0 . 003 mM of rabbit muscle actin ( titrand ) and titrated against TgADF which was ﬁlled in the syringe of 290 l L at a con - centration of 0 . 03 mM . The injectant volume was set at 10 l L per R . Yadav et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 176 ( 2011 ) 97 – 111 99 injection , and the duration of the injection was 20 s , with an inter - val of 180 s between injections . During the titration , the reaction mixture was continuously stirred at 351 rpm . Control experiments were performed by injecting TgADF into G - actin buffer under con - dition exactly similar to the rabbit muscle actin / titrand titration , to take into account heats of dilution and viscous mixing . The heats of injection of the control experiment were subtracted from the raw data of rabbit muscle actin and titrand titration . Dioctanoyl L - a - Phosphatidyl - D - myo - inositol 4 , 5 - diphosphate ( dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) was purchased from Sigma – Aldrich . The stock solutions of dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 were prepared by dissolv - ing 1 mg of the lipid either in 1 mL of G - actin buffer without TgADF , or in 1 mL of G - actin buffer having 0 . 03 mM TgADF . Titra - tion of TgADF – dioctanoyl PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , and dioctanoyl PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 to G - actin was done in similar conditions as above for TgADF and G - actin . Control experiments were performed by injecting diocta - noyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and TgADF – dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in buffer . The ITC data were analyzed using the ORIGIN version 7 . 0 soft - ware provided by MicroCal™ . The heats of binding were normal - ized with respect to the titrand concentration , and a volume correction was performed to take into account dilution of titrand during each injection . The amount of heat produced per injection was calculated by integration of the area under each peak using a baseline selected by the ORIGIN program , assuming a one site binding model . The dissociation constant ( Kd ) and molar enthalpy ( D H ) for the binding of titrand to actin was determined by non - linear least square ﬁtting to the data . 2 . 6 . Docking of rabbit muscle actin monomer with TgADF The Crystal structure of C - terminal ADF - H domain of Twinﬁlin ( Twc ) in complex with G - actin monomer ( PDB ID : 3DAW ) was ta - ken as a template to build a docked model of TgADF with G - actin monomer . TgADF shares only 12 % sequence identity with Twc . However , residues in the helix a 3 region which is important for the G - actin binding are highly conserved . We used GRAMM - X protein – protein docking web server V - 1 . 2 . 0 which is publicly available ( http : / / vakser . bioinformatics . ku . edu / resources / gramm / grammx ) for docking studies . In order to validate the docking pro - gram we analyzed the details of interface of Twc and G - actin monomer crystal structure ( PDB ID : 3DAW ) by using the web based server PDBePISA ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / msdsrv / prot _ int / pistart . html ) . Thereafter , we separated the Twc and G - actin mono - mer from the crystal structure and used the actin and Twc as receptor and ligand , respectively , for docking at the GRAMM - X protein – protein docking server . The details of interface of the Twc docked over G - actin monomer were reanalyzed using the ser - ver PDBePISA . Now , TgADF was taken as ligand and the G - actin monomer from the crystal structure of PDB ID 3DAW , after remov - ing the Twc from it , was taken as receptor and docked using the GRAMM - X protein – protein docking server . The details of the inter - face area were analyzed by using the web based server PDBePISA ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / msdsrv / prot _ int / pistart . html ) . 3 . Result 3 . 1 . Assignments and data deposition Backbone resonance assignments were made for 107 out of the 113 possible H N / N crosspeaks in the 15 N – 1 H HSQC spectrum ( Fig . 1 ; 118 residues excluding ﬁve prolines ) . The 15 N – 1 H HSQC spectrum of 15 N labeled TgADF , with assignments of residues name and number , is shown in Fig . 1 .

Structure determination and statistics Structural parameters for the solution structure of TgADF are summarized in Table 1 . The ensemble of 10 structures , ribbon rep - resentation , and electrostatic potential surface for the lowest en - ergy minimized structure is shown in Fig . 2 . The pair wise RMSD for the ordered region and the secondary structured region of the ensemble of 10 structures is 0 . 9 Å and 0 . 7 Å , respectively . The atomic coordinates for all 10 structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ID : 2L72 ) . The solution structure of TgADF can be conventionally related to the canonical ADF / coﬁlin fold found in the ADF / coﬁlin , twinﬁlin , and drebrin / abp1 families of actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) ( Lappa - lainen et al . , 1998 ) . The core of the TgADF consists of a central six - stranded mixed b - sheet that is encased by helices a 1 and a 3 on one face and by helix a 2 and the C - terminal end of the TgADF , on the opposite face . The strand ordering is b 1 – b 3 – b 2 – b 4 – b 5 – b 6 , in which four central strands are antiparallel and strands b 1 – b 3 and b 5 – b 6 run parallel to each other . The b - strands are b 1 ( G6 - V7 ) , b 2 ( W26 - E32 ) , b 3 ( K35 - G42 ) , b 4 ( F60 - D64 ) , b 5 ( I69 - W74 ) and b 6 ( A105 - A108 ) , and the a - helices are a 1 ( E9 - L18 ) , a 2 ( N45 - A52 ) , and a 3 ( V81 - L98 ) . Close to the C - terminal of TgADF , there is a short helical turn involving the residues M111 – L114 . The ori - entation of this helical turn is ﬁxed due to NOEs observed between residues of this region and residues around the helix a 2 . The helix a 1 is parallel to the strand b 2 and helix a 3 is parallel to the strand b 5 . The longest helix a 3 in the structure of TgADF is slightly kinked , almost in the center , at residues S89 and S90 . This kinking , which is a conserved structural feature of ADF / coﬁlins , is well supported by observed NOEs between side chain of L94 ( helix a 3 ) and F60 ( strand b 3 ) and between S90 and L94 of helix a 3 and I31 of strand b 2 . Long range NOEs were observed between residues of helix a 3 , strand b 5 , and the loop connecting strand b 2 – b 3 . These NOEs de - ﬁne the position of the helix a 3 . The solution structure of TgADF is stabilized by a few salt bridges in the structure . The C - terminal of the helix a 1 is stabilized by the salt bridges clustered between E17 and R21 ( C - terminal of a 1 ) , K25 ( b 2 ) , and K43 ( b 3 ) . The inter - action of helix a 1 and strand b 3 is stabilized by the salt bridge be - tween R14 ( a 1 ) and D41 ( b 3 ) . K19 of helix a 1 also forms salt bridge with D99 present at the C - terminal end of the helix a 3 . Another salt bridge is present between R59 ( b 4 ) and E39 ( b 3 ) and D57 , which stabilizes the interaction of strand b 3 and strand b 4 . The salt bridges are supported by the presence of NOE cross peaks between the backbone and side chains of the residues forming salt bridges and were visualized in the program Discovery Studio ( DS 2 . 1 ) . Comparison of TgADF structure with other ADF / coﬁlin proteins in the Protein Data Bank was carried out using the program Dali - Lite version 3 . 0 ( Holm et al . , 2008 ) .

Yadav et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 176 ( 2011 ) 97 – 111 101 with Acanthamoeba actophorin ( sequence identity 39 % , PDB ID : 1CNU ) with Z - score of 12 . 1 and RMSD of 2 . 6 Å . TgADF shares RMSD of 2 . 4 Å with plant ADF ( sequence identity 47 % , PDB ID : 1F7S ) and S . pombe ( sequence identity 42 % , PDB ID : 2I2Q ) . However , it shares higher RMSD with vertebrate ADF / coﬁlin structures . It has RMSD of 2 . 8 Å , 2 . 9 Å , and 3 . 3 Å with Twinﬁlin C - terminal ADF - H domain ( se - quence identity 15 % , PDB ID : 3DAW ) , chicken coﬁlin ( sequence identity 34 % , PDB ID : 1TVJ ) , and human non - muscle coﬁlin ( se - quence identity 36 % , PDB ID : 1Q8G ) , respectively . The solution structure of TgADF varies from the other ADF / coﬁ - lin structure in terms of the surface charge distribution that is important for dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 interaction . Residues K95 , K96 , W104 , K112 , K114 , K125 , K126 , K127 , K132 , and H133 are conserved in mouse coﬁlin 1 , human coﬁlin 1 , chicken coﬁlin 1 , and human destrin . The cluster of these residues confers a large positively charged surface which is critical for dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 binding . In TgADF , the corresponding residues are C65 , G66 , W74 , K82 , R84 , L95 , K96 , K97 , T102 , and A103 , which do not yield a large positively charged surface similar to vertebrate analogs . The charged residues in TgADF are labeled and shown in Fig . 2C . C65 and G66 are present at the F - loop ( loop connecting b 4 – b 5 ) . The residues K82 – K97 are present on the helix a 3 , while T102 and A103 are at the N - terminal of strand b 6 . 3 . 3 . Backbone dynamics of TgADF To gain an insight into the backbone dynamics of TgADF in solu - tion , we measured 15 N longitudinal relaxation rates ( R 1 ) , transverse relaxation rates ( R 2 ) and { 1 H } – 15 N heteronuclear NOEs . The back - bone relaxation rates of 85 out of 113 non proline residues were calculated by using the program Curveﬁt . The average values of relaxation parameters for these residues are R 1 = 1 . 78 s (cid:3) 1 , R 2 = 8 . 77 s (cid:3) 1 , and steady state heteronuclear { 1 H } – 15 N NOE = 0 . 76 . The residue speciﬁc R 1 , R 2 and steady state heteronu - clear { 1 H } - 15 N NOE values obtained for TgADF at 600 MHz are shown in Fig . 3 . The relaxation parameters were subjected to Mod - elfree analysis ( Mandel et al . , 1995 ; Palmer et al . , 1991 ; Pulavarti et al . , 2008 ; Roger and Loria , 2003 ) , which yielded a rotational cor - relation time ( s m ) of 6 . 20 ± 0 . 02 ns for the protein molecule . In Modelfree analysis , 84 residues could be ﬁtted while one residue , A2 , remained unﬁtted . The average generalized order parameter S 2 for the 84 ﬁtted residues is 0 . 88 ± 0 . 02 . 61 residues were ﬁtted to model 1 , with an average S 2 = 0 . 91 ± 0 . 01 ; ten residues were de - scribed by model 2 , with an average S 2 = 0 . 79 ± 0 . 02 ; ten residues were described by model 3 , with an average S 2 = 0 . 87 ± 0 . 01 ; one residue was described by model 4 with S 2 value of 0 . 81 ± 0 . 02 ; two residues were described by model 5 , with an average S 2 = 0 . 55 ± 0 . 01 . Most of the residues ﬁtted in model 1 lie in regions having secondary structure . The generalized order parameter S 2 , the effective correlation time s e , and chemical exchange parameter R ex versus residues number is shown in Fig . 4 . The generalized order parameter S 2 for N - terminal , F - loop , and C - terminal are 0 . 45 ± 0 . 02 , 0 . 88 ± 0 . 01 , and 0 . 82 ± 0 . 02 , respectively , indicating that the N - terminal is far more ﬂexible in comparison to the F - loop and the C - terminal . The residues L18 , R21 ( C - terminal of a 1 ) K22 , N78 , K82 ( a 3 ) , L98 ( a 3 ) , G100 ( loop between a 3 and b 6 ) , A103 , V104 ( loop between a 3 and b 6 ) , E107 ( b 6 ) , and E110 , show R ex term ranging from 1 . 15 to 5 . 97 Hz . Residues G4 , M5 , G6 , K35 , I36 , D57 , R59 , K68 , S89 , D92 , E107 , H109 , L114 , show effective correlation time and are expected to undergo ﬂuctuations on fast picoseconds - to - nanosecond time scale . The ribbon representations of lowest en - ergy TgADF structure shaded according to residue speciﬁc general - ized order parameters ( S 2 ) , effective correlation time ( s e ) and conformational exchange term ( R ex ) are shown in Fig . 5 Essentially similar results were obtained when the relaxation data was ana - lyzed by using the axially symmetric diffusion tensor . The general - ized order parameter S 2 , the effective correlation time s e , and chemical exchange parameter R ex versus residues number for axi - ally symmetric diffusion tensor are shown in Supplementary Fig . 1 . The comparison of the residues ﬁtted to different Modelfree models , for the isotropic diffusion tensor and axially symmetric diffusion tensor , is shown in Supplementary Table 1 . 3 . 4 . Isothermal titration calorimetry The structural features of TgADF are well supported by a direct demonstration of its binding with rabbit muscle G - actin in the presence of ADP . Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) titration of TgADF with ADP – G - actin reveals 1 : 1 . 23 stoichiometry and a dis - sociation constant Kd of 23 . 81 nM , with D G of (cid:3) 10 . 39 (cid:4) 10 4 cal / mole , D H of (cid:3) 1 . 39 (cid:4) 10 4 ± 175 . 5 cal / mole and D S of (cid:3) 11 . 80 cal / mole K . The binding of TgADF to G - actin is enthalpy driven . The ITC curve is shown in Fig . 6 . The experiments were repeated three times with varying protein concentrations . The ITC titrations also show that neither ADP – G - actin nor TgADF , in G - actin buffer , interact with dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . The interaction of TgADF with dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was conﬁrmed by titrating TgADF with dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( Fig . 7A ) . The interaction of TgADF with G - actin in the presence of dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was conﬁrmed by ﬁrst titrating dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 with G - actin ( Fig . 7B ) , and then the G - actin – dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 mixture with TgADF ( Fig . 7C ) . The ITC data shows that the stoichiometry of inter - action is 1 : 1 . 40 with a dissociation constant Kd of 69 . 44 nM with D G of (cid:3) 9 . 76 (cid:4) 10 4 cal / mole , D H of (cid:3) 1 . 15 (cid:4) 10 4 ± 409 . 7 cal / mole and D S of (cid:3) 19 . 2 cal / mole K , which is compatible with results ob - tained from titrating TgADF alone with G - actin . A similar S - shaped one - binding site thermogram was obtained , although with higher baseline noise , when a mixture of TgADF – dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was titrated with G - actin . The lack of structural interaction be - tween TgADF and dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was also conﬁrmed by recording 1 H – 15 N - HSQC spectra of 15 N - labeled - TgADF in the pres - ence and absence of dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . The 1D proton spectra of dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 with and without TgADF is shown in Fig . 7D . In Fig . 7E , the overlapped 1 H – 15 N - HSQC spectra of TgADF and TgADF – dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 are shown . No chemical shift pertur - bation of TgADF peaks is seen in the presence of (cid:2) 10 - fold molar excess of dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . 3 . 5 . Docking of rabbit muscle actin monomer with TgADF We used GRAMM - X protein – protein docking web server V - 1 . 2 . 0 for generating a docked model of TgADF with rabbit muscle G - actin monomer . The details of interface area of TgADF docked onto G - actin monomer are given in Table 2 . In our TgADF – actin docked model , several hydrogen bonds were observed between the resi - dues of TgADF and G - actin . The residue S89 ( a 3 ) of TgADF formed hydrogen bonds with residues A144 and Y143 from helix connect - ing the subdomain 1 and 3 of actin . Residues A93 ( a 3 ) and K96 ( a 3 ) of TgADF formed hydrogen bonds with residues T351 and M355 , respectively , from subdomain 1 of the actin . The strand b 6 of TgADF interacted with helix connecting the subdomain 1 and 3 of actin through a hydrogen bond between E107 ( b 6 ) of TgADF and R147 - T149 of G - actin . N - terminal of TgADF also interacted with subdomain 1 of the actin by forming hydrogen bond between backbone amide of G4 of TgADF and backbone carboxyl of G23 of actin . The interactions between TgADF and G - actin are depicted in Supplementary Fig . 2 . In our TgADF – actin docked model , residues M1 , A2 , and S3 from N - terminal were in close proximity to the residues D24 , D25 , L349 , and I345 from subdomain 1 of G - actin . The residues V81 , K82 , M85 , A88 , D92 , and K97 from helix a 3 of TgADF were in close prox - 102 R . Yadav et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 176 ( 2011 ) 97 – 111 imity to residues P332 , P333 , E334 , N296 , K326 , and E167 from subdomain 3 of G - actin . The residues V104 ( b 6 ) , H109 , and E110 of TgADF were in close proximity to the residues S145 and Y143 from helix connecting subdomain 1 and 3 of actin , respectively . The TgADF and G - actin interacting residues in our TgADF – G - actin docked model is further supported by in silico mutational analysis . We generated two models from the lowest energy minimized solu - tion structure of TgADF : ( 1 ) K96D ; E107 K and ( 2 ) K82D ; R84D . These two models were energy minimized and re - docked as de - scribed above in materials and methods . It was found that these two models failed to dock onto G - actin at the cleft between subdo - main 1 and 3 . The docking study of the mutated models is also sup - ported by previous study where the mutants R96A , K98A and D123A of yeast coﬁlin ( corresponding to K82 , R84 and E107 of TgADF ) were found to cause defects in interaction with actin ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . The comparison of TgADF – actin docked model and Twc in com - plex with the G - actin monomer shows that the residues Y143 , Fig . 3 .

( a ) R 1 ; ( b ) R 2 ; ( c ) steady state { 1 H } – 15 N NOE ; and ( d ) R 2 / R 1 ratio values of TgADF obtained on 0 . 8 mM 15 N labeled sample at 25 (cid:3) C on a Varian Inova spectrometer at 600 MHz . R . Yadav et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 176 ( 2011 ) 97 – 111 103 A144 , R147 , T148 , and T149 from the helix connecting subdomain 1 and subdomain 3 ; T351 , I345 , and E334 of subdomain 1 ; and E167 from subdomain 3 , are common in interaction of TgADF and Twc with G - actin . The buried interface area for the Twc in complex with the G - actin monomer is (cid:2) 1200 Å 2 ( 15 . 2 % ) and for the TgADF – actin docked model it is (cid:2) 1000 Å 2 ( 16 % ) . The percent - age of interacting residues at the interface of the Twc - actin is 21 . 4 % while that for the TgADF – actin interface , it is 23 . 7 % . The he - lix a 3 is the region through which both Twc and TgADF are primar - ily interacting with the G - actin monomer at the cleft between subdomain 1 and 3 . However , the orientation of the helix a 3 with respect to the cleft is different for the Twc and TgADF . In the TgADF – actin docked model , complete helical length of helix a 3 ﬁts at the cavity formed by subdomain 1 and 3 of actin , while in the case of crystal structure of Twc in complex with the G - actin , only half of the complete helical length of helix a 3 ﬁts in the cavity and rest half of the helix does not participate in interaction with G - actin . This apparent difference in the orientation of the helix a 3 of TgADF and Twc at the cavity of subdomain 1 and 3 of actin is clearly noticeable as can be seen from the Supplementary Fig . 3 . 4 . Discussion The gliding motility of the apicomplexan parasite T . gondii is essential for it to invade host cells and to egress from this Fig . 4 . Plots of optimized Modelfree parameters like generalized order parameter ( S 2 ) , the effective correlation time ( s e ) and the chemical exchange parameter ( R ex ) as a function of residue number for TgADF . 104 R . Yadav et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 176 ( 2011 ) 97 – 111 intracellular niche once replication is complete ( Sibley , 2010 ) . Pro - ductive gliding motility requires rapid turnover of actin ﬁlaments , which is carefully regulated by small subset of actin binding pro - teins formins , proﬁlins , capping protein , ADF , cyclase - associated protein , and coronin ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . T . gondii actin is rela - tively unstable and under conditions suitable for formation of F - ac - tin , it only forms small oligomers that sediment at 350 , 000 g . Interestingly , 98 % of the actin is unpolymerized in T . gondii , even though it lacks a dedicated G - actin sequestering protein , such as b - thymosin ( Nachmias , 1993 ) . Additionally , TgProﬁlin , although essential for gliding motility , shows only weak sequestering activ - ity towards heterologous actin ( Plattner et al . , 2008 ) . Since TgADF possesses high net F - actin disassembling activity in conjunction with low severing activity , it has been proposed to be a prime can - didate for controlling the ﬁlament turnover . Genetic knockdown of TgADF conﬁrms this prediction , as in the absence of normal levels , enhanced ﬁlamentous actin formation impedes motility and cell invasion ( Mehta and Sibley , 2011 ) . The biochemical properties of TgADF have been studied in detail ( Mehta and Sibley , 2010 ) and it belongs to a speciﬁc functional subtype shared with Caenorhab - ditis elegans ADF / coﬁlin homolog Unc60A ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) , and embryonic chick skeletal muscle ADF ( Abe and Obinata , 1989 ) . This functional subtype is characterized as having the following activities : an inhibitory effect on actin polymerization ; strong sequestration of monomeric actin ( G - actin ) ; inhibition of actin nucleation ; inhibition of nucleotide exchange by G - actin ; weak F - actin severing activity ; lack of stable F - actin binding ; and highly efﬁcient net disassembly of F - actin . Moreover , the TgADF activity is independent of pH . The high monomer sequestering activity and low severing activity has been associated with the scenario where the actin ﬁlaments must be rapidly assembled and disas - sembled ( Mehta and Sibley , 2010 ) . From a primary sequence viewpoint , TgADF belongs to a speciﬁc subgroup of ADF / coﬁlin family having the smallest number of res - idues within the ADF / coﬁlin family . TgADF has high sequence homology ( 75 % ) to the shorter Plasmodium ADFs . With respect to TgADF , the shorter Plasmodium ADFs have a one residue insert after the C - terminus residue G42 of strand b 3 , and a three residues in - sert after the residue D57 in the loop connecting a 2 to b 4 . The po - sition of these residues is such that it does not affect interaction with actin . Therefore , the biochemical properties and structural properties of shorter ADFs of Plasmodium are expected to be very similar to that of TgADF . The solution structure of TgADF is characterized by conserved ADF / coﬁlin fold with the N - terminal ﬂexible region , conserved long kinked helix , shortened F - loop that did not project beyond the overall ellipsoid structure , and a truncated C - terminal having a short helical segment in place of the helix a 4 . The G - actin binding site of the TgADF is well formed and is deﬁned by the long kinked helix a 3 , the N - terminal ﬂexible region , the strand b 6 , and loop be - fore the C - terminal helical turn ( Paavilainen et al . , 2008 ) .

The docking of TgADF with rabbit muscle G - actin mono - mer suggests that the complete helical length of helix a 3 of TgADF interacts with G - actin . The helix a 3 in the TgADF has positively charged residues K82 at its N - terminus , while it has two contigu - ous charged residues , K96 and K97 , at its C - terminus . The latter feature is also observed in human ADF ( Yeoh et al . , 2002 ) and acto - phorin ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ) .

Yadav et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 176 ( 2011 ) 97 – 111 with actin . The residues V81 , K82 , M85 , A88 , D92 , A93 , K96 , and K97 from helix a 3 of TgADF were found to interact with the G - actin . The two residues S89 and D92 at the center of helix a 3 are ﬂexible as indicated by effective correlation time . Moreover , the residues at both the ends of the helix a 3 ( K82 and L98 ) show con - formational exchange . The G - actin interacting residues of TgADF involved in hydrogen bonding as shown in Fig . 8B are on the same face with the residues showing conformational exchange and effective correlation time ( Fig . 8A ) . In addition to the helix a 3 , other interacting residues are from the N - terminal region , strand b 6 , and the segment preceding C - terminal helical turn . Interest - ingly , many of these residues , for example , N78 , G100 , A103 , V104 ( b 6 ) , E107 ( b 6 ) , are similarly involved in conformational ex - change on milli - to - microsecond time scale . Thus , overall it seems that TgADF is structurally and dynamically suited to have highly optimized interactions with G - actin . The dynamically optimized interaction of TgADF with G - actin is reﬂected in the equilibrium dissociation constant of 0 . 02 l M mea - sured with the ITC experiments . ITC experiments were done with rabbit muscle ADP – G - actin . For a direct comparison of ITC results , the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of ADF / coﬁlin protein from L . donovani with ADP – G - actin , also obtained from ITC experiments ( Pathak et al . , 2010 ) , has been reported to be (cid:2) 0 . 2 l M . High afﬁnity in similar range ( 2 – 30 nm Kd ) has been observed between Mouse ADF / coﬁlins ( coﬁlin - 1 , coﬁlin - 2 , or ADF ) and Mg - ADP – G - actin through ﬂuorometric measurements using NBD - labeled actin samples ( Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) . Given that the binding afﬁnity determined with ﬂurometric methods is slightly higher than that determined by ITC , we believe that the interaction between TgADF and G - actin , and that of mouse ADF / coﬁlin with G - actin , may very well reﬂect the strongest possible interactions for this pair of proteins , as most of the other ADF / coﬁ - lin proteins bind to ADP – G - actin with afﬁnities of 0 . 5 – 1 l M . The structural features of TgADF have to be examined in view of this high afﬁnity for ADP – G - actin . Usually there is a 10 to 20 - fold decrease in the afﬁnity for Mg - ATP – G - actin in comparison to ADP – G - actin . Previously , the apparent afﬁnity of 0 . 64 l M has been reported between TgADF and Mg - ATP – G - actin , which was deter - mined on the basis of the effect of TgADF on the rate of nucleotide exchange by G - actin ( Mehta and Sibley , 2010 ) . The afﬁnity of TgADF for Mg - ATP – G - actin is in the same range as other members of its functional subtype . For example , Unc60A and chick ADF have afﬁnities for Mg - ATP – G - actin of (cid:2) 1 . 6 l M and 1 l M , respectively ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Yamashiro et al . , 2005 ) . The large difference be - tween the afﬁnities of TgADF for ADP – G - actin versus ATP – G - actin may provide thermodynamically the driving force needed for highly efﬁcient disassembly of F - actin . In conventional ADF / coﬁlins , the F - loop includes a pair of basic residues at the beginning of the b 5 strand . The C - terminal a 4 helix , and / or the C - terminal tail , also contain some charged residues . These F - loop basic residues and C - terminal charged residues to - gether can increase the stability of interaction of ADF / coﬁlin for F - actin , leading to increased severing activity ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ; Ono et al . , 2001 ; Pope et al . , 2000 ) . It has been observed for many systems that the net ﬁlament disassembly activity is in - versely related to stability of interaction with F - actin . Pope et al . ( 2004 ) have demonstrated that mutating the ﬁrst ( R96 in S . pombe coﬁlin , K68 in TgADF ) of the two basic residues in the F - loop region that are critical for F - actin binding , results in human coﬁlin losing its ability to bind F - actin , and instead causes it to effect the exten - sive depolymerization of ﬁlaments . It has been shown that intro - duction of point mutations G66R and G66 K in TgADF had little effect on its co - sedimentation or disassembly of actin ﬁlaments ( Mehta and Sibley , 2010 ) , suggesting that the position and orienta - tion of nearby basic residue K68 might be more important for F - actin severing activity . On the other hand , extension of C - terminal of TgADF with a seven residue charged segment , corresponding to the last seven residues of S . pombe coﬁlin , resulted in a two - fold in - crease in the amount of TgADF co - sedimenting with F - actin and decreased disassembly of F - actin ( Mehta and Sibley , 2010 ) . In the TgADF solution structure , the F - loop comprises the b – b turn connecting strand b 4 and strand b 5 and contains a total of 15 residues ( b 4 : ﬁve residues ; b 5 : six residues ; interconnecting loop : four residues ) . Unlike all the other ADF / coﬁlin proteins , this segment does not project out of the structure because of its short length . In the solution structure of TgADF , the C - terminal helix a 4 is not properly formed and in its place there is a three residue helical turn . Yet , in terms of dynamics , both the F - loop , and the C - terminal regions are fairly rigid , except for residues N67 and K68 that are at the tip of F - loop . This allows for an interesting com - parison with the solution structure of LdCof . In LdCof , the F - loop contains a total of 23 residues ( b 4 : 10 residues ; b 5 : 11 residues ; interconnecting loop : two residues ) , i . e . 8 residues more than TgADF , and the F - loop duly projects out of the structure . The turn residues connecting b 4 and b 5 are K77 and R78 , i . e . basic residues . The C - terminal of LdCof has a properly formed helix a 4 and also several basic residues are present in the C - terminal tail . The aver - age S 2 value of N - terminal , F - loop and C - terminal for TgADF are 0 . 45 , 0 . 88 , and 0 . 82 , respectively , while the corresponding values for LdCof are 0 . 43 , 0 . 76 , and 0 . 35 , respectively . This shows that while the N - terminal segments of TgADF and LdCof are equally ﬂexible , the F - loop and C - terminal segment of TgADF are rigid in comparison to the corresponding regions of LdCof ( Fig . 8C , D ) . Although , LdCof conforms to all of the above described features for stable interaction with F - actin , yet it has been experimentally demonstrated that it does not co - sediment with rabbit muscle F - actin , and it has weak F - actin severing activity . Our current under - standing is that for stable interaction of ADF / coﬁlins with F - actin , structural features like an outwardly projecting F - loop and well formed C - terminal helix a 4 , and biochemical features like presence Table 2 Interface interaction results for docking of crystal structure of actin and TgADF .

Yadav et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 176 ( 2011 ) 97 – 111 107 of basic residues on the F - loop and at the C - terminal of the protein , are essential . Our results highlight the importance of conforma - tional rigidity of the involved structural segments as another fea - ture that may be necessary for stable interactions with F - actin , while for weak F - actin severing activity the presence of a single surface exposed basic residue K68 in TgADF and K80 in LdCof on the F - loop may be sufﬁcient . The N terminus of ADF / coﬁlin proteins is highly conserved and in particular the residue S3 is an important contact site for interac - tions with actin . The activity of some AC proteins is negatively reg - ulated by phosphorylation at this site ( Allwood et al . , 2002 ; Gungabissoon et al . , 1998 ; Ojala et al . , 2001 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) . In the case of TgADF , the S3E mutation , which potentially mimics the phosphorylation at this site , made the resulting mutant completely inactive ( Mehta and Sibley , 2010 ) . The N - terminal of TgADF is clearly very mobile and structurally poorly deﬁned . How - ever , we could clearly notice a chemical shift perturbation effect for residues I31 ( b 2 ) and L94 ( a 3 ) upon cleavage of N - terminal puriﬁ - cation tag . Therefore , it is imperative that the N - terminal is nestled along the border of helix a 3 and strands b 2 . Incidentally , in TgADF structure S3 is proximal to T34 . The residues N33 and T34 located between the loop connecting the strand b 2 and b 3 could not be as - signed due to line broadening and are said to have motion on inter - mediate NMR timescale . Moreover , contiguous residues K35 and I36 display ﬂuctuations on picoseconds - to - nanosecond time scale . Overall , this gives a picture of highly dynamic N - terminal with res - idues around S3 , especially N33 and T34 from the loop joining b 2 and b 3 , displaying conformational ﬂexibility , perhaps , to accommo - date the steric requirements of phosphorylation , although this modiﬁcation has not been demonstrated in apicomplexans . The segment R21 - K25 of TgADF sequentially overlaps with ver - tebrate ADF / coﬁlins viz . destrin , human coﬁlin - 1 and chicken coﬁ - lin - 2 ( Gorbatyuk et al . , 2006 ; Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ; Pope et al . , 2004 ) , where this region corresponds to an insert that contains a putative nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) that is believed to be responsible for the nuclear translocation of ADF / coﬁlin proteins upon cellular stresses . It has been proposed that this region may to undergo an exchange between a helical and extended conforma - tion , and may , therefore , function as a molecular switch to dictate the cellular localization of vertebrate ADF / coﬁlin proteins . The putative NLS sequence in vertebrates is also believed to be respon - sible for the formation of nuclear coﬁlin : actin rods ( Nishida et al . , 1987 ) . The residues L18 , R21 and K22 from the segment R21 – K25 display conformational exchange on millisecond - to - microsec - ond time scale . These residues are near to the residues I20 , T23 , and V24 located between the helix a 1 and strand b 2 which could not be assigned due to line broadening . These missing residues in 15 N - HSQC are expected to undergo intermediate motion on the NMR timescale making them intractable in backbone assignment experiments . This suggests that the segment L18 – K25 is most Fig . 8 .

Yadav et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 176 ( 2011 ) 97 – 111 likely undergoing conformational exchange between two stable conformers and could have some undiscovered role in interaction with other proteins . The structure and dynamics of segment R21 – K25 of TgADF are shown in Fig 9A , and for comparison the corresponding NLS region of human coﬁlin - 1 is highlighted in Fig . 9B . TgADF does not show any detectable interaction with diocta - noyl PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in ITC and NMR experiments . Moreover , the pres - ence of dioctanoyl PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 does not interfere with binding of TgADF with rabbit muscle ADP – G - actin . It has been suggested that PIP2 inhibits the ADF / coﬁlin - actin interaction by steric occlusion of actin binding site on ADF / coﬁlin ( Kusano et al . , 1999 ; Ojala et al . , 2001 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1991a , b ) . Gorbatyuk et al . ( 2006 ) have shown that dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 interacts speciﬁcally to the puta - tive F - actin and G - actin binding site on the ADF / coﬁlin ( Gorbatyuk et al . , 2006 ) , but a recent study suggest that this interaction is unspeciﬁc and multivalent in nature ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) . The nega - tively charged phosphate head of dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 interacts with the positively charged surface of the ADF / coﬁlin ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) . It has been observed that in mouse coﬁlin - 1 , human coﬁlin - 1 , chicken coﬁlin - 1 , and human destrin the positively charged surface is created by the cluster of highly conserved resi - dues K95 , K96 , W104 , K112 , K114 , K125 , K126 , K127 , K132 , and H133 ( Fig . 9D ) . Thus the interaction of dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 with ADF / coﬁlin needs a cluster of large solvent exposed positively charged amino acid residues on the surface of the ADF / coﬁlin pro - teins . The sequence alignment of TgADF with above mentioned coﬁlin sequences suggests that the positively charged surface in TgADF is contributed by a much smaller cluster of positively charged residues K82 , R84 , K96 , and K97 all from helix a 3 ( Fig . 9C ) , and therefore lacks the large patch required for interact - ing with the negatively charged head of dioctanoyl - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . In conclusion , we have presented the ﬁrst solution structure of an apicomplexan ADF protein and have characterized its complete backbone dynamics , its afﬁnity for G - actin in the presence of ADP , and its binding to dioctanoyl - PIP2 . The novelty of work is in recog - nizing the high afﬁnity of TgADF for ADP – G - actin and its lack of interaction with PIP2 . Moreover , based on the comparison of dynamics of TgADF with LdCof and other ADF / coﬁlin proteins , we can conclude that conformational rigidity of F - actin binding sites of ADF / coﬁlin is necessary for stable binding to F - actin , while for weak F - actin severing activity the presence of a single surface Fig . 9 .
