Room 131H , New Haven , CT 06520 13 Phone : 203 - 737 - 6411 , fax : 203 - 785 - 4305 14 Abstract 15 16 Somatic cell reprogramming is a stochastic process typically resulting in only a small fraction of 17 cells successfully converting into induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) . The molecular and 18 cellular basis underlying this stochasticity remains elusive . Here we demonstrate that this 19 stochasticity can be largely eliminated when extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) activity 20 is tuned within a narrow range by using the MEK inhibitor at one tenth the concentration in the 2i 21 media . Without pharmacologic inhibition , cells tune ERK activity by TFII - I D , a multifunctional 22 transcription factor that binds to and mediates ERK’s nuclear activation . We find TFII - I D to be an 23 actin - binding protein . ERK activity is partially inhibited as TFII - I D binds to actin which 24 accumulates inside the nucleus of cells undergoing morphological remodeling . Manipulating 25 actin’s ability to accumulate inside the nucleus alters reprogramming amenability as well cell 26 height . Actin - TFII - I D drive cell height to go above the minimal height required for pluripotency 27 ( 10 µ m ) . This work uncovers a mechanistic couple between cell morphology and identity , 28 providing convenient practices to massively increase reprogramming efficiency . 29 Introduction 30 Pluripotent stem cells ( induced pluripotent stem cells , iPSC ; embryonic stem cells , ESC ) display 31 stereotypic cell / colony morphology , informing the day - to - day quality assessment of the cultures . 32 Naïve iPSC / ESC colonies display “dome - shaped” morphology , loss of which indicates exit from 33 naïve pluripotency 1 , 2 . Even though cell morphology constitutes an integral aspect of a cell’s 34 identity , it is unclear how morphology is molecularly coupled to enable specific identity . 35 36 Cell morphology is largely determined by the actin cytoskeleton , dynamic proteinaceous 37 structures consisted of monomeric G - actin and polymeric F - actin 3 , 4 . Actin dynamics is further 38 modified by many actin binding proteins , such as nucleators , crosslinkers , branchers , as well as 39 cross talkers with the other components of the cytoskeleton 5 - 8 . Actins , together with myosins , 40 form molecular motors that convert chemical energy into mechanical energy . Therefore , the 41 actomyosin system is central to transducing and interpreting the mechanical signals between 42 the cell and its environment 9 - 13 . Actin is one of the most abundant cellular proteins , with the 43 majority of the actin pool known to be present in the cytoplasm of most cell types 14 , 15 . The 44 presence of a small pool of nuclear actin has been long considered an impurity or artifact until 45 relatively recently 16 - 26 . Here , we report that mouse pluripotent stem cells allocate a significant 46 portion ( > 50 % ) of their actin pool into the nucleus ; allocating more actin into the nucleus 47 facilitates cell morphological changes favoring pluripotency . 48 49 TFII - I ( encoded by Gtf2i ) is a multifunctional transcription factor with several alternatively spliced 50 isoforms involved in signal - induced gene regulation 27 - 32 . We discovered that the delta isoform of 51 TFII - I ( TFII - I D ) , previously reported to undergo cytoplasmic and nucleus shuttling 33 , to be highly 52 expressed in cells transitioning into pluripotency . Nuclear actin promotes reprogramming by 53 binding to TFII - I D , thereby limiting ERK’s activation mediated by TFII - I D . Mimicking this mild 54 ERK inhibition pharmacologically eliminates the stochasticity in Yamanaka reprogramming , 55 resulting in the reactivation of pluripotency from most fibroblasts . 56 57 Results 58 More actin inside the nucleus favors pluripotency 59 In addition to being a major component of the cytoskeleton , actin dynamics participates in 60 transducing mechanical signals , in large part by binding to and inhibiting the mechanosensitive 61 transcriptional co - activator MKL1 9 , 34 - 36 . Together with its binding partner Serum Response 62 Factor ( SRF ) , MKL1 drives the expression of hundreds of genes involved in contractility and 63 adhesion . A truncated MKL1 lacking the actin binding domains is constitutively active ( caMKL1 ) , 64 which potently arrests somatic cell reprogramming into pluripotency 37 . The arrested 65 reprogramming can be rescued by genetic or pharmacologic inhibitors of actomyosin 66 contractility . In addition to the rescuers reported in Hu et al . 37 , we found that shRNAs targeting 67 Xpo6 , the exportin for nuclear actin , similarly rescued the caMKL1 - blocked cells into 68 pluripotency ( Fig . S1a - c ) . These results suggest that failure to activate pluripotency could be 69 related to insufficient actin in the nucleus . Consistent with this interpretation , a significant portion 70 of the actin pool is found in the nucleus of ESC and iPSC ( Fig . 1a ) . Furthermore , more actin 71 becomes allocated into the nucleus during somatic cell reprogramming into pluripotency , with 72 the somatic ( hematopoietic ) cells displaying predominantly cytoplasmic actin ( Fig . 1b , Fig . S1d ) . 73 74 To test whether allocating more actin into the nucleus promotes somatic cell reprogramming into 75 pluripotency , we transduced Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs ) derived from doxycycline 76 ( Dox ) inducible Oct4 / Klf4 / Sox2 / Myc ( OKSM ) mice expressing the Oct4 : GFP reporter 77 ( R26 rtTA ; Col1a1 4F2A ; Oct4 GFP ) 38 , 39 , with a retroviral construct encoding b - actin , tagged on the N - 78 terminus with a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) and FLAG epitope ( Fig . 1c ) . Empty vector ( EV ) 79 or wild type ( WT ) b - actin were used as controls . The presence of exogenously expressed actin 80 was confirmed by immunofluorescence ( IF ) against FLAG ( Fig . 1d ) . In cells expressing the WT 81 b - actin , most FLAG signals localized to the cytoplasm , confirming actin’s predominant 82 cytoplasmic localization . In contrast , FLAG signal was enriched in the nucleus of cells 83 expressing NLS - actin . The nuclear FLAG signals appeared as elaborate networks ( Fig . 1d , 84 Movie S1 ) , suggesting that the NLS - actin is involved in F : G ( filamentous and globular actin ) , 85 dynamics and crosslinking / branching with the endogenous actin . Of note , cytoplasmic FLAG 86 signals were also detected in cells expressing NLS - actin , likely reflecting actin’s strong tendency 87 toward cytoplasmic localization despite the NLS , with a key determining factor becoming clear 88 later in this study . The overexpression level is mild , estimated to be ~ 1 % of the endogenous 89 actin ( Fig . 1e , S1e ) . Reprogrammable MEF expressing these constructs were treated with Dox 90 to induce OKSM . Strikingly , the number of alkaline phosphatase positive ( AP + ) or Oct4 : GFP 91 positive colonies were greatly increased by NLS - actin expression , while no difference was 92 shown by cells expressing WT b - actin ( Fig . 1f - h ) . To determine whether F : G dynamics is 93 required for NLS - actin to promote reprogramming , we expressed point mutants NLS - actin G13R 94 and NLS - actin S14C , defective in polymerization or depolymerization , respectively 40 ( Fig . 1f - h , 95 S1f , Movies S2 , 3 ) . Neither mutants increased the number of AP + or Oct4 : GFP + colonies . 96 Therefore , concentrating F : G competent actin inside the nucleus promotes pluripotency 97 induction from mammalian somatic cells , contrasting the findings in frog oocytes in which 98 polymerized nuclear actin was more functional 41 . 99 100 Besides the increased numbers of AP + and Oct4 : GFP + colonies , the colonies arising from NLS - 101 actin expressing cells had sharp borders and were light reflective , displaying typical dome 102 shaped morphology on day 15 ( Fig . 1i ) . In contrast , many of the colonies in EV control 103 reprogramming cultures had Oct4 : GFP + cells diffused / mixed within flatter colonies . Further , 104 Oct4 : GFP was brighter when NLS - actin was expressed , as determined by flow cytometry ( Fig . 105 1j - l ) . Over time , the Oct4 : GFP + cells from EV cultures matured and acquired an intensity similar 106 to those expressing NLS - actin , while the % Oct4 : GFP + in the latter expanded . Lastly , NLS - actin 107 promoted reprogramming is not limited to MEFs , as NLS - actin similarly promoted 108 reprogramming of hematopoietic cells ( Fig . S1g - i ) . Taken together , NLS - actin promotes 109 pluripotency induction from somatic cells by Yamanaka factors . 110 111 NLS - actin promotes somatic cell reprogramming defying known mechanisms 112 To understand how NLS - actin facilitates pluripotency activation , we began by comparing the 113 transcriptomes of MEFs expressing NLS - actin , WT b - actin and EV ( Fig . 2a , b , Table S1 ) . In the 114 absence of Yamanaka factor expression ( Vehicle ) , neither actin constructs caused substantial 115 transcriptomic changes . 4 days of Yamanaka factor expression ( Dox ) led to changes in 116 thousands of genes irrespective of the co - expressed actin constructs ( Fig . 2b ) , as expected . We 117 therefore focused on the transcriptomic differences in reprogramming cells co - expressing either 118 actin constructs , or as compared to EV controls . WT b - actin and NLS - actin similarly reduced 119 SRF target genes as assessed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) 42 , 43 ( Fig . 2c , d , S2a ) , 120 confirming actin’s known effects in inhibiting MKL1 / SRF . Despite their similar inhibition of SRF 121 targets , GSEA revealed that NLS - actin expressing cells more resemble pre - iPSCs , as defined 122 by Polo et al . 44 relative to those expressing WT b - actin ( Fig . 2e ) . Since many SRF targets are 123 typical mesenchymal genes , the similar inhibition of SRF targets by both actin constructs argues 124 against the notion that antagonizing mesenchymal identity is how NLS - actin promotes 125 reprogramming ( Table S1 ) . Gene Ontology ( GO ) analysis of the 158 up - and 300 down - 126 regulated ( differentially expressed genes ) DEGs ( Fig . 2b ) between the actin constructs only 127 enriched for “structural constituent of ribosome” , “pre - mRNA intronic binding” and cadherin 128 based adhesion ( Table S2 ) , yielding little insights into the mechanism how NLS - actin promotes 129 pluripotency . 130 131 Even after 8 days of factor induction , when increased H3K4me3 marks at pluripotency genes 132 became prominent in NLS - actin expressing cells ( Fig . S2b , c ) , cells expressing different 133 constructs displayed no difference in cell cycle , bulk transcriptional activity or DNA damage ( Fig . 134 S2d - f ) , all processes in which nuclear actin have been reported to function 19 , 45 - 53 . As cell 135 extrinsic signals such as secreted factors in the medium could influence reprogramming 54 , we 136 next compared cells within the same culture using mCherry fluorescence to distinguish cells 137 with or without NLS - actin ( Fig . 2f - j ) . At day 10 when Oct4 : GFP + cells began to emerge ( 0 . 55 % 138 Oct4 : GFP + ) , the mCherry + cells were enriched for iPSC genes as compared to the mCherry - 139 cells from the same culture ( Fig . 2g , h ) . Robust Oct4 : GFP + cells ( 38 . 8 % ) emerged on day 14 , of 140 which about 25 . 1 % were mCherry - ( Fig . 2i ) . On day 14 , among the Oct4 : GFP - population , the 141 mCherry + cells were still enriched for iPSC genes as compared to the mCherry - counterparts 142 ( Fig . 2j , left ) . In contrast , day 14 Oct4 : GFP + / mCherry + cells were less similar to iPSCs as 143 compared to the Oct4 : GFP + / mCherry - cells , consistent with the latter being mature iPSCs that 144 have silenced the retroviral construct ( Fig . 2j , right ) . When all cell states throughout the 145 reprogramming time course were compared by CellNet analysis 55 ( Fig . 2k , S2g ) , it confirmed 146 that reprogramming was initiated from fibroblasts , went through intermediate states and ended 147 with a cell state highly similar to ESC . However , CellNet analysis could not even detect a more 148 advanced cell state toward pluripotency at day 10 in NLS - actin expressing cells ( Fig . 2k , S2g ) , 149 Therefore , NLS - actin’s surprising pro - reprogramming effect remains difficult to explain through 150 its known modes of action . 151 152 Gtf2i / TFII - I is required for NLS - actin to promote reprogramming 153 To understand how nuclear actin promotes somatic cell reprogramming , we determined the 154 nuclear actin interactome in the reprogramming intermediates by co - immunoprecipitation ( Co - 155 IP ) with FLAG antibody followed by mass spectrometry ( Fig . S3a ) . Silver stain of the nuclear 156 protein precipitates from WT b - actin and NLS - actin expressing cells detected two prominent 157 bands of 42 KD and 250 KD , corresponding to actin and Myh9 / 10 , respectively , and confirmed 158 by protein - specific antibodies ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Other abundant nuclear proteins such as histone H3 159 was not enriched , confirming the specificity of our approach . A total of 122 proteins with at least 160 2 unique peptides in the WT b - actin or NLS - actin samples were recovered ( Table S3 ) . These 161 122 candidates include 38 known actin - binding proteins , 76 known RNA binding proteins and 22 162 known DNA binding proteins ( Fig . 3c ) . The large number of known DNA / RNA binding proteins is 163 consistent with their nuclear enriched expression . We envisioned that this nuclear actin 164 interactome contain mediators for NLS - actin’s pro - reprogramming function . 165 166 We next constructed a custom guide RNA ( gRNA ) library to pinpoint the candidate ( s ) that 167 mediate NLS - actin’s pro - reprogramming function . If a specific gene is required for NLS - actin to 168 promote reprogramming , NLS - actin + cells expressing gRNAs targeting that gene should not 169 reprogram , resulting in depletion of such gRNAs relative to the other gRNAs in the library , 170 quantifiable by sequencing . This nuclear actin interactor targeting ( NAIT ) library contains 528 171 gRNAs against the 122 candidates plus 10 additional control genes , with 4 gRNAs per gene 172 ( Table S4 ) . The pooled sgRNA library , co - expressing blue fluorescence protein ( BFP ) , was 173 transduced into Cas9 expressing reprogrammable MEFs ( Fig . 3d ) . BFP + cells were then 174 transduced with NLS - actin / mCherry and genomic DNA was harvest as input DNA . After Dox 175 induction , mCherry + and mCherry - cells were sorted to provide at least 150x coverage , 176 sufficient to detect these reprogramming cells which had an efficiency of ~ 7 . 5 % ( Fig . 1h ) . The 177 abundance of individual gRNAs in the mCherry + / - cells was quantified by sequencing starting at 178 day 4 and compared against the input DNA 56 , 57 . This analysis revealed that multiple gRNAs 179 targeting Gtf2i ( encoding TFII - I ) were the most depleted in the NLS - actin expressing cells ( Fig . 180 3e , S3b , c , Table S4 ) . We validated that TFII - I protein is indeed precipitated by NLS - actin ( Fig . 181 S3d ) , and IF detected prominent TFII - I signal on the fibrous nuclear actin network ( Fig . S3e , f ) . 182 183 To independently validate the functional importance of Gtf2i in mediating NLS - actin’s pro - 184 reprogramming effect , we designed three shRNAs against Gtf2i and confirmed their knockdown 185 in reprogrammable MEF ( Fig . 3f ) . Of note , Gtf2i was previously identified in a genome wide 186 screen as a reprogramming barrier during the transitional stage 58 . In the non NLS - actin 187 expressing cells , Gtf2i shRNAs increased colony numbers by ~ 2 fold ( Fig . 3g ) , similar to the 188 report by Yang et al . 58 . In comparison , NLS - actin caused increase in colony numbers was more 189 pronounced ( Fig . 3g , S3g , h ) . Importantly , NLS - actin - mediated increase in colony numbers was 190 abolished by the Gtf2i shRNAs . The effects could be seen with all three individual Gtf2i shRNAs 191 ( Fig . 3g , S3g , h ) . In subsequent experiments , these shRNAs were pooled which yielded similar 192 knockdown efficiency ( Fig . 3h ) . Consistent with the increase in Oct4 : GFP + colony numbers , 193 Gtf2i targeting shRNAs led to brighter Oct4 : GFP in EV control cells ( Fig . 3i - l ) . Strikingly , no 194 Oct4 : GFP + colonies were present in NLS - actin expressing cells with Gtf2i knockdown ( KD ) . 195 Further , such colonies appeared spread or flat ( Fig . 3i , bottom right ) . Thus , NLS - actin depends 196 on Gtf2i / TFII - I to promote reprogramming . 197 198 The delta isoform of TFII - I , TFII - I D , mediates NLS - actin’s pro - reprogramming effect 199 TFII - I is highly conserved between human and mouse and has several alternatively spliced 200 isoforms 59 , 60 . Two of the abundant isoforms , Δ and β , are detected in most cell types , including 201 fibroblasts ( Fig . 4a ) . Of note , Gtf2i mRNA reads mapping to this alternative region were 202 abundant during reprogramming ( Fig . 4a , boxed region ) . As this region is involved in generating 203 the Δ and β isoforms , these results suggest that TFII - I isoforms could be differentially expressed 204 during reprogramming , even though the mRNA reads of the entire Gtf2i gene remains similar 205 ( Fig . S4a ) . To better resolve the expression of these isoforms , we designed primers that span 206 the alternatively utilized exons ( Fig . 4a , black arrows ) . The transcripts detected by these primers 207 decreased in the reprogramming intermediates , while the relative portion of Δ increased ( Fig . 208 4b , c ) . Together , these results suggest that specific Gtf2i isoform , the Δ isoform , might be the 209 relevant one in mediating NLS - actin promoted pluripotency activation . Indeed , a larger TFII - I 210 protein band dominated in MEF , while iPSC expressed a faster - migrating species , consistent 211 with their expression of the β and Δ isoforms , respectively ( Fig . 4d ) 33 . Lastly , the expression of 212 these isoforms in mature iPSC and ESC is sensitive to cell plating density ( Fig . 4e ) : the Δ 213 isoform dominates at high density , while β becomes more abundant at low density ( Fig . 4e ) . 214 These results echo our previous findings that higher cell density favors pluripotency 54 . 215 Together , these results suggest Δ - specific biology during reprogramming . 216 217 To further test the isoform - specific roles , we designed two additional shRNAs targeting exon 12 218 ( Fig . 4a , orange bars ) , which is absent in Gtf2iΔ , while the shRNAs shown earlier ( Fig . 3f - k , 219 S3g , h ) targeted both Δ and β isoforms ( Fig . 4a , three black bars ) and will be referred to as the 220 Δ / β dual targeting shRNAs from here on . Indeed , either β - specific or Δ / β dual targeting shRNAs 221 efficiently reduced TFII - I protein in the initial MEF , which predominantly express the larger β 222 isoform ( Fig . 4f , S4b ) . In contrast , only the Δ / β dual targeting shRNAs reduced the protein in 223 later reprogramming cells ( day 12 ) , which expressed the smaller Δ isoform ( Fig . 4f , Fig . S4b ) . 224 Importantly , the β - specific shRNAs did not change the number of AP + or Oct4 : GFP + colonies in 225 NLS - actin expressing cells , contrasting the situation with Δ / β dual targeting shRNAs ( Fig . S4c - e , 226 compare to Fig . 3f - l and Fig . S3g , h ) . Consistent with the unchanged colony numbers , β - specific 227 shRNAs did not affect NLS - actin promoted Oct4 : GFP intensity ( Fig . 4g - j ) . These results further 228 support that TFII - IΔ is the relevant isoform under our experimental conditions . From here on , we 229 focused on how TFII - IΔ functions in reprogramming . 230 231 Inhibiting TFII - I D while co - expressing NLS - actin reduces pERK to a level not permissive 232 for reprogramming 233 Next , we co - expressed TFII - IΔ directly with or without NLS - actin in reprogramming MEFs ( Fig . 234 5a - c ) . Consistent with its role in mediating NLS - actin’s effect , TFII - IΔ co - expression potentiated 235 NLS - actin promoted reprogramming . Remarkably , a tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutant TFII - 236 IΔ Y248F abolished this potentiation effect . Since this TFII - IΔ Y248F mutant was reported to be 237 defective in binding ERK 30 , we examined pERK binding to TFII - IΔ in the reprogramming 238 intermediates by co - IP . Indeed , pERK binding to TFII - IΔ Y248F was significantly reduced as 239 compared to WT TFII - IΔ , particularly in NLS - actin expressing cells ( Fig . 5d ) . These results 240 suggest that effect of NLS - actin - TFII - IΔ on reprogramming could be mediated through 241 regulating ERK activity . 242 243 TFII - IΔ is an atypical transcription factor in that it can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the 244 nucleus . When TFII - IΔ translocates into the nucleus upon growth - factor signaling , it imports 245 pERK leading to the activation of ERK target genes such as c - fos 33 . Given ERK’s well 246 established function in regulating pluripotency 61 - 68 , and iPSC have low pERK ( Fig . 5e ) , we 247 examined whether ERK activity is affected by NLS - actin and / or TFII - IΔ . As indicated by the live 248 cell ERK - KTR reporter 69 , 70 , NLS - actin expression dampened serum stimulated ERK activation 249 ( Fig . 5f ) . Specifically , ERK remained active at least 40 minutes after serum stimulation in EV 250 control cells ; in contrast , ERK became inactivated in NLS - actin expressing cells as soon as 251 serum was washed out . We next examined the endogenous ERK activity in reprogramming 252 MEFs by western blotting for pERK . Consistent with the results by the ERK - KTR reporter , pERK 253 level was reduced in NLS - actin expressing cells ( Fig . 5g , h ) . Furthermore , Δ / β dual targeting 254 shRNAs also reduced pERK levels , consistent with its reported role in mediating pERK’s 255 nuclear activation 33 . Thus , either NLS - actin expression or Δ / β dual targeting shRNAs each 256 reduced ERK activity and promoted reprogramming . However , while the lowest pERK level 257 occurs with simultaneous NLS - actin expression and Δ / β KD , such a condition became 258 incompatible with reprogramming ( Fig . 5g - h , also refer to Fig . 4g - j , 3f - k ) . We interpreted these 259 results to mean that even though lowering ERK activity favors pluripotency , pluripotency may 260 need to arise within a narrow range of ERK activity ; lowering it further beyond this range would 261 again inhibit reprogramming . Such an interpretation is consistent with a model where the TFII - IΔ 262 pool for activating ERK is constrained by binding to actin . We tested this possibility by 263 fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) using TFII - IΔ - GFP fusion protein . This 264 confirmed that NLS - actin indeed rendered TFII - IΔ - GFP slower to recover after photobleaching 265 ( Fig . S5a ) . Taken together , TFII - IΔ tunes ERK activity to promote reprogramming , a process 266 that became unmasked by NLS - actin expression ; as the TFII - IΔ pool bound to actin becomes 267 compromised for ERK activation , further reducing TFII - IΔ by sgRNAs or shRNAs abolishes 268 reprogramming . 269 270 Mild ERK inhibition by chemical inhibitors promotes reprogramming from most 271 fibroblasts 272 The ERK tuning model predicts that pluripotency would be effectively induced if ERK activity is 273 tuned pharmacologically . We therefore treated reprogrammable MEF with Dox in the presence 274 of a well validated MEK inhibitor , PD032591 , ranging from 0 . 05 µ M to 1 µ M , a staple of the 2i 275 media for cultivating naïve ESC 65 . Progression toward pluripotency was monitored by flow 276 cytometry for % Oct4 : GFP + ( Fig . 6a ) . Strikingly , in the presence of 0 . 1 µ M of PD032591 , > 60 % 277 of all cells became Oct4 : GFP + by 13 days and ~ 80 % cells were Oct4 : GFP + on day 21 ( Fig . 278 S6a , b ) . In contrast , the % Oct4 : GFP + remained low throughout in 0 . 05 or 0 . 25 µ M of PD032591 . 279 The effect of mild ERK inhibition was confirmed by western blotting for pERK ( Fig . 6b , c ) . Of 280 note , there was a sharp drop in pERK level between reprogramming day 4 and 7 . While 0 . 1 µ M 281 PD0325901 had no discernible inhibition of pERK on day 4 , the inhibition became clear on day 282 7 . We repeated this mild inhibition by another ERK inhibitor , U0126 . Low dose U0126 also 283 significantly increased the % Oct4 : GFP + cells , albeit to a lesser extent than PD0325901 ( Fig . 284 S6c - f ) . Therefore , somatic cell reprogramming into pluripotency is greatly increased when ERK 285 activity is tuned within a narrow range . We interpreted these results to indicate that the 286 probability of a given cell to tune their ERK activity within this range is low ( i . e . stochastic ) ; when 287 enforced pharmacologically , reprogramming into pluripotency is no longer rare and could occur 288 in most cells ( Fig . S6g ) . Consistently , 0 . 1 µ M PD0325901 became ineffective in cells that 289 already express NLS - actin or have TFII - IΔ KD ( Fig . 6d - f ) . Therefore , excessive ERK inhibition 290 by combining molecular and chemical inhibitors yields a cell state that is no longer permissive 291 for pluripotency initiation . 292 293 With the insights that mild reduction in ERK activity could be how NLS - actin promotes 294 reprogramming , we re - examined the transcriptomes of reprogramming MEF expressing the 295 actin constructs ( Fig . 2b ) . To this end , we found that a small subset of ERK target genes , 296 originally defined using optogenetically controlled ERK 71 ( ERK pulse ) , were significantly down - 297 regulated in NLS - actin expressing cells ( Fig . 6g ) ; most other ERK targets did not change with 298 NLS - actin expression ( Fig . 6h ) . Of note , although this subset of ERK target genes was originally 299 defined following pulsatile ERK activation , it is likely that their expression reflects other states of 300 subtle ERK signaling as well . Nonetheless , NLS - actin expression dampens ERK activity and 301 reduces the expression of a small subset of ERK target genes , including several immediate 302 early genes that are known to inhibit pluripotency 72 . 303 304 Actin fails to accumulate in the nucleus below a threshold nuclear height 305 The increase in reprogramming efficiency by NLS - actin was less profound than chemical ERK 306 tuning , suggesting unknown processes counteracting the cells’ tuning ability even in the 307 presence of NLS - actin expression . The manipulations that changed reprogramming efficiency in 308 our experiments had consistent effects on colony morphology : colonies failing to activate 309 Oct4 : GFP appeared more spread or flat . We therefore assessed if / how cell height is altered , a 310 morphologic parameter that was recently recognized to dictate cell behavior 73 , 74 , 75 . Following 311 the measurements determined in these studies , we first reprogrammed cells using a cell height 312 confiner ( Fig . 7a , b ) at 5 or 10 µ m . While some Oct4 : GFP + colonies could be found under 10 µ m 313 confinement , no Oct4 : GFP + colonies were present under 5 µ m confinement ( Fig . S7a ) . The 314 cells outside of the confinement area remained Oct4 : GFP + and had typical dome morphology , 315 indicating that the loss of Oct4 : GFP is specific to the cells under height - confinement ( Fig . 7b , 316 Fig . S7a ) . As the colonies under 10 µ m confinement appeared partially flattened , we increased 317 confinement height to 20 µ m . Under 20 µ m , Oct4 : GFP + colonies of normal morphology 318 appeared ( Fig . 7c , d , Fig . S7b ) . 10 µ m confinement reduced the number and intensity of 319 Oct4 : GFP + cells . Under 5 µ m confinement , only fibroblastic - like cells could be identified and 320 none were Oct4 : GFP + . These results demonstrate that cells need to reach a minimal height of 321 10 µ m to reactive Oct4 , whereas 20 µ m is the permissive cell height . Importantly , at 10 µ m or 5 322 µ m height , NLS - actin was no longer found inside the nucleus , indicating that sufficient cell 323 height is required for actin to enrich inside the nucleus ( Fig . 7e , f ) . Lastly , we confined ESC 324 derived from the inner cell mass of Oct4 : GFP mouse for 16 hours ( Fig . 7g , h , Fig . S7c ) . Similar 325 to the reprogramming cells , these already pluripotent stem cells retained normal colony 326 morphology and remained Oct4 : GFP + under 20 µ m confinement . 10 µ m confinement partially 327 flattened the colonies and reduced Oct4 : GFP intensity . Strikingly , colonies under 5 µ m 328 confinement lost Oct4 : GFP fluorescence without any other differentiation - inducing signals ( Fig . 329 7g , h , Fig . S7c ) . These results indicate that cell height could alter actin’s nuclear allocation , and 330 has a dominating effect to inhibit pluripotency gene expression . 331 332 Fibroblast reprogramming cultures ( e . g . day 6 - 8 ) primarily contain two types of cells readily 333 distinguishable by morphology and / or their relationship with neighboring cells : clusters of cells 334 appearing as colonies and those retaining fibroblast morphology ( Fig . 7i , Movie S4 ) . We 335 determined the fibroblastic cells to have a typical nuclear height of ~ 5 µ m , while the cells in 336 colonies reach ~ 10 µ m in height ( Fig . 7j , k ) . Cells expressing NLS - actin , but not those 337 expressing WT b - actin , or point mutants NLS - actin G13R and NLS - actin S14C , had nuclear height to 338 be around or above 10 µ m . Furthermore , TFII - IΔ KD or NLS - actin expression individually 339 increased nuclear height , but their combination resulted in low nuclear height ( Fig . 7l - n ) . Taken 340 together , the ERK - tuning by TFII - IΔ likely mediates the actin reallocation and cell morphologic 341 changes accompanying reprogramming . 342 343 344 Discussion 345 Yamanaka reprogramming from most somatic states is rare , which occurs stochastically , as 346 each cell has a low , random chance of reprogramming ( Fig . S6g ) 76 - 79 . Our earlier work has 347 revealed that reprogramming stochasticity is absent in a rare population of myeloid progenitors 348 which exhibit unusually fast cell cycle 80 , 81 . Prospective isolation of the fast - cycling subpopulation 349 of fibroblasts drastically enriches for reprogramming activity . Strikingly , these fast - cycling 350 fibroblasts display a much less spread cell morphology 37 , 54 , 82 that we now show to being taller . 351 One of the most profound changes that occurs during reprogramming is a switch in the 352 biological interpretation of ERK signaling at the cellular level : in nearly all differentiated types , 353 ERK activity is pro - proliferative , but in pluripotent stem cells ERK activity must be kept low to 354 avoid differentiation . Fine - tuning this ERK activity transition dramatically increases 355 reprogramming efficiency , so that most cells in culture can activate pluripotent gene expression . 356 We propose that cell morphology integrates into cell identity regulation by titrating ERK activity : 357 much more actin is being allocated into the nucleus as cells change identity . At least one 358 consequence of the nuclear accumulated actin is to sequester TFII - IΔ , thereby inhibiting this 359 mode of ERK activation . This model deepens the connection between cell 360 morphology / mechanics and cell identity / behavior found in other biological systems 83 - 85 , as well 361 as in pluripotent stem cells 68 , 86 , 87 . 362 363 Nuclear actin is known to be present in large quantity in frog oocyte germinal vesicles 88 . These 364 exceptionally large cells collapse to gravity when this nuclear actin meshwork is disrupted 89 . 365 Given this insight , it is perhaps not surprising why polymerized actin is required in the germinal 366 vesicle to reprogram the transplanted somatic nuclei , as shown by Gurdon and colleagues 41 . 367 Mammalian somatic cells are five orders of magnitude smaller , where the possibility that nuclear 368 actin primarily functions by mechanical support becomes slim . However , injected somatic nuclei 369 do undergo prominent “swelling” in this system 90 . Filamentous actin also form in mammalian 370 somatic nucleus immediately after mitosis , expanding the compact postmitotic nucleus to that of 371 G1 conformation ; interfering with nuclear actin pool size or polymerization leads to significantly 372 reduced nuclear volume 46 . Across these diverse biological contexts , a coherent theme appears 373 to be nuclear actin’s role in modulating the size and / or morphology of the nucleus . In this 374 regard , we found that allocating more actin into the nucleus increases nuclear height , and 375 sufficient height is necessary for actin’s nuclear enrichment ( Fig . 7 ) . 376 377 The importance of nuclear height has only begun to be appreciated 73 , 74 , 75 . In 2D cultured cells , 378 confining cell height to 5 µ m , but not 10 µ m , triggers actomyosin contractility due to stretching of 379 the nuclear membrane and activating the mechanosensitive calcium channels leading to Ca2 + 380 directed actomyosin contractility 73 . Similar findings are seen in cells in 3D tissues 75 . Insights 381 from these complementary contexts paint a model for how restrictive nuclear dimensions control 382 cell’s contractility , perhaps enabling it to “run away” when severely confined . This intuitive model 383 lends insights into why NLS - actin fail to concentrate in the flattened nucleus ( Fig . 7e , f ) , as a 384 contractile cytoplasm likely draws monomeric actin away from the nucleus . However , the full 385 picture is likely more complex ( e . g . whether there is involvement of nuclear Ca2 + 91 was not 386 considered ) . Experimental approaches with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution / precision 387 allowing the detection of rapid and subcellular signaling dynamics are required to further delve 388 into this problem . 389 390 Our approach in identifying TFII - I as an actin - binding protein is inherently biased toward highly 391 abundant nuclear proteins and / or strong binding affinity ( Fig . 3a - c ) , suggesting potential 392 generalizability . In mice , Gtf2i inactivation results in early embryonic lethality 92 . In humans , 393 hemizygous deletion of GTF2I genomic region is associated with neurodevelopmental deficits 394 known as Williams - Beuren Syndrome , while its duplication leads to autism spectrum disorders 395 92 - 94 . Single nucleotide polymorphisms at GTF2I loci are associated with autoimmune diseases 396 95 - 97 . A point mutation ( L424H ) is prevalent in thymic epithelial tumors 98 . Contrasting its 397 importance in development and diseases , the understanding of how GTF2I abnormality causes 398 diseases is limited . Our work is partly based on the previous reports on how Gtf2i / TFII - I 399 participates in regulation via interactions with ERK 32 , 99 , 28 . The involvement for this actin - TFII - IΔ - 400 ERK axis in other cellular contexts awaits further examination . With multiple MEK / ERK inhibitors 401 in the clinics , our model suggestions that dosages of such pharmacologic agents need to be 402 taken into consideration to achieve desired effects . The small subset of down - regulated genes by 403 NLS - actin , such as c - fos , are well validated targets of ERK and TFII - I . How TFII - I - ERK functions 404 to transcriptionally regulate pluripotency also awaits further investigation . 405 406 407 Material and Methods 408 409 Cell culture and reprogramming 410 All mouse work was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale 411 University .
