A wide range of mediators of ﬁnal follicle maturation has been identiﬁed in rodents , non - human primates and cows . study design , size , duration : Prospective cohort study including 24 women undergoing ovarian stimulation with the long gonado - trophin - releasing hormone agonist protocol during 2010 – 2012 at Holbæk Fertility Clinic . Nine paired samples of GC and 24 paired samples of follicular ﬂuid ( FF ) were obtained before and after recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( rhCG ) administration . participants / materials , setting , methods : Nine paired ( nine arrays before rhCG and nine arrays after rhCG ) samples of GC mRNAwere ampliﬁed and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1 . 0 ST GeneChip arrays , compared and bioinformaticallyanalyzed . Eleven selected genes were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR . FF hormones were analyzed by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay . main results and the role of chance : Elevenhundredandeighty - sixgenesweredifferentiallyexpressed ( . 2 - fold , P , 0 . 0001 , false discovery rate , 0 . 0012 ) when comparing GC isolated beforeand 36 h after hCG , among thosewere genes known to be expressed at ovu - lation , i . e . ADAMTS1 and HAS2 . Many new ovulation - related genes were revealed , such as CD24 , ANKRD22 , CLDN11 and FBXO32 . FF estrogen , androstenedione and anti - Mu¨llerian hormone decreased signiﬁcantly while progesterone increased , accompanied by radical changes in the ex - pression of steroidogenic genes ( CYP17A , CYP19A , HSD11B1 and HSD11B2 , StAR ) . Genes related to inﬂammation , angiogenesis , extracellular matrix formation , growth factors and cancer were up - regulated while cell cycle genes were massively down - regulated . Seventy - two genes pre - viously described in connection with ovarian cancer were among the highly regulated genes . In silico analysis for top upstream regulators of the ovulatory trigger suggested—besides LH—TNF , IGF1 , PGR , AR , EGR1 ( early growth response 1 ) , ERK1 / 2 ( extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 / 2 ) and CDKN1A ( cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ) as potential mediators of the LH / hCG response . limitations , reasons for caution : The present dataset was generated from women under hormonal stimulation . However , comparison with a macaque natural cycle whole follicle ovulation dataset revealed major overlap , supporting the idea that the ovulation - related genes found in this study are relevant in the human natural cycle . & The Author 2014 .

Key words : granulosa cell transcriptome / ovulation / hCG trigger / follicular ﬂuid / human Introduction The mid - cycle surge of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) is the physiological triggerofovulation , whileabolushCGisthegoldenstandardusedincon - nection with assisted reproduction . Ovulation essentially induces three distinct and highly complex pro - cesses comprising oocyte maturation , ovulation with release of an oocyte and transformation of the avascular granulosa cells ( GC ) into the highly vascularized granulosa - lutein cells . Rupture of the follicles has been characterized as a local inﬂammatory process during which thefolliclereleasestheenclosedmatureoocyteandsubsequentlyunder - goes profound remodeling leading to the formation of a corpus luteum ( CL ) to support possible implantation . The molecular processes behind the ovulatory cascade have only been studied in humans to a limited extent , because of limited access to follicles immediately before triggering of ﬁnal oocyte maturation . Although some data are available from animal studies ( Park et al . , 2004 ; Espey , 2006 ; Stocco et al . , 2007 ; Xu etal . , 2011 ; Christenson etal . , 2013 ) , resultsmaynotreadilyextrapo - late to humans . Inthisstudy , wedescribefortheﬁrsttimeapairedanalysisoftranscrip - tome changes in GC and hormonal changes in follicular ﬂuid ( FF ) of the preovulatoryfolliclesbeforeand36 hafterrecombinanthumanchorion - ic gonadotrophin ( rhCG ) triggering of ﬁnal oocyte maturation from the same women in the same cycle following controlled ovarian stimulation ( COS ) . Materials and Methods ThisstudywasapprovedbyTheDanishScientiﬁcEthicalCommittee ( SJ - 156 ) andconductedinaccordancewiththeHelsinkiDeclarationII . Allparticipants gave informed consent before their inclusion in this study . Participants A paired sample of FF before and after rhCG administration was obtained from each of 24 women aged ( mean + SD ) 27 . 9 + 3 . 4 years . Only those women who had developed more than eight follicles of at least 14 mm in diameter at the last control visit before rhCG triggering were enrolled . From 9 of the 24 women GC yielding good quality RNA were obtained prior to and after rhCG triggering ( patient demographics and baseline char - acteristicareshowninSupplementarydata , TableSI ) . Thedemographicsand baseline characteristics in the nine women who contributed with paired samples of GC did not differ from the 15 women who only contributed paired samples of FF ( data not shown ) . Controlled ovarian stimulation with exogenous gonadotrophins The women were treated according to the standard long gonadotrophin - releasing hormone agonist protocol : pituitary desensitization with buserelin 0 . 5 mg ( Suprefact w , Sanoﬁ - Aventis , France ) was started on Cycle day 21 . COS with recombinant follicle - stimulating hormone ( rFSH ) ( Puregon w , MSD , Denmark ) was started after at least 14 days of desensitization . Six thousand ﬁve hundred international units rhCG ( Ovitrelle w , Merck Serono , Denmark ) was administered 36 h before oocyte pick - up ( OPU ) when at least three follicles had reached the size of 17 mm . Follicle puncture and isolation of GC FFandGCweresampledbytransvaginalultrasoundguidedpunctureofafol - licle 14 – 17 mm in diameter at the last control visit before administration of rhCG . Follicle puncturewasperformed (cid:2) 13 h prior to rhCG administration for 10 women , 37 h for 13 women and 61 h for one woman . For the nine pairedsamplesusedformicroarrayanalysis , fourfolliclepunctureswereper - formedat13 h , fourfolliclepuncturesat37 handonefolliclepunctureat61 h prior to hCG administration . Thepuncturewasperformedwithasinglelumenneedle ( WallaceOocyte Recovery Systems , Smith Medical , Brisbane , Australia ) attached to a syringe ( 10 mlBDDiscardit TM II , BectonDickinson S . A . Fraga , Huesca , Spain ) under transvaginal ultrasound guidance . After collection of FF , a new syringe con - taining ﬂushing medium ( Sydney IVF Follicle Flush buffer K - SIFB - 100 , Cook , Queensland , Australia ) was used to ﬂush the follicle if no or few GC aggre - gates were present in the FF . During OPU , FF from the ﬁrst punctured follicle on each ovary was col - lected separately and used for collection of GC and FF . GC were isolated as described previously ( Grøndahl et al . , 2012 ) . FF analysis ImmediatelyafterGCcollection , FFwasisolatedbycentrifugationat300 g for 10 min . The supernatant was transferred to 2 ml cryotubes and stored at 2 80 8 C until analysis . Estrogen , progesterone , androstenedione and testos - terone were measured with enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( NovaTec Immundiagnostica , Dietzenbach , Germany , DNOV 002 , 003 , 006 and 008 , respectively ) and performed according to manufacturer’s instructions . Anti - Mu¨llerian Hormone ( AMH ) was measured with AMH ELISA kit ( AMH ELISA , AL - 105 - i Ansh Labs Houston , TX , USA ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Isolation of mRNA The Absolutely RNA Nanoprep kit from Stratagene ( Agilent Technologies , Waldbronn , Germany ) was used to isolate total RNA from GC according to the manufacturer’’s instructions . The samples were analyzed for total RNA quality and level of degradation using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer 998 Wissing et al . and RNA 6000 Pico LabChip according to the manufacturer’’s instructions ( RNA 6000 Pico assay kit , Agilent Technologies , Waldbronn , Germany ) . All of the RNA samples showed two distinct peaks representing 18s and 28s rRNA which indicated good quality RNA . Microarray analysis Total RNA ( ranging from 1 . 5 – 50 ng RNA , mean + SD 27 + 18 . 9 ng ) from each sample was ampliﬁed using the Ovation Pico WTAv . 2 RNA Ampliﬁca - tionSystemfromNuGEN w Inc . ( NuGEN w , SanCarlos , CA , USA ) andbiotin labeling was performed with the Encore Biotin Module ( NuGEN w ) . The labeled samples were hybridized to the Human Gene 1 . 0 ST GeneChip array ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The arrays were washed and stainedwithphycoerythrinconjugatedstreptavidin ( SAPE ) usingtheAffyme - trixFluidicsStation w 450 , andthearrayswerescannedintheAffymetrixGen - eArray w 30007Gscannertogenerateﬂuorescentimages , asdescribedinthe Affymetrix GeneChip w protocol . Cell intensity ﬁles ( CEL ﬁles ) were gener - ated in the GeneChip w Command Console w Software ( AGCC ) ( Affyme - trix ) . Validation of differential expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR ( qRT - PCR ) Thefollowinggenesweretestedbypre - designedTaqMan w GeneExpression Assays ( gene symbol / catalogue number ) : CD24 ( Hs03044178 _ g1 ) , AREG ( Hs00950669 _ m1 ) , HSD11B1 ( Hs01547870 _ m1 ) , HSD11B2 ( Hs003886 69 _ m1 ) , PTGS2 ( Hs00153133 _ m1 ) , COL6A3 ( Hs00915125 _ m1 ) , CYP19A1 ( Hs00903413 _ m1 ) , IGF2 ( Hs04188276 _ m1 ) , PTTG1 ( Hs00851754 _ u1 ) , CCNA2 ( Hs00996788 _ m1 ) and INHBA ( Hs01081598 _ m1 ) as well asthe En - dogenous Control Assays for human glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydro - genase ( GAPDH ) ( Applied Biosystems / Life Technologies Europe , Nærum , Denmark ) . The data were normalized to GAPDH , and relative quantiﬁcation according to the comparative cycle threshold ( CT ) Method ( LightCycler480 Software , Roche , Denmark ) was used to quantify gene expression . GAPDH was chosen as reference gene based on stable expression in GC over various follicle classes ( Kristensen et al . , 2013 ) . Average cycle threshold ( Ct ) values for GAPDH ( mean + SD ) were 21 + 1 . 2 and 22 + 1 . 4 before and after rhCG , respectively .

Differential gene expression analysis For statistical analysis the CEL ﬁles ( nine representing GC before rhCG and nine representing GC 36 h after rhCG ) were imported into the R ( www . r - project . org / ( 27 January 2014 , date last accessed ) . ) where they were robust multichip averaged ( RMA ) using quantile normalization and Median Polish summarization ( Bolstad et al . , 2003 ) . The expression proﬁles in the two conditions were compared and genes were deﬁned as differentially expressed when they were selected in the paired t - test , having P - values below 0 . 0001 and fold - change . 2 . All samples are minimum information about a microarray experiment ( MIAME ) compliant and were handled according to standard operation pro - cedures in the Microarray Center . The 18 arrays were submitted to Array - Express at EMBL using MAGE - TAB submission . The accession number is E - MTAB - 2203 . Gene function and pathway enrichment analysis The list of differentially expressed genes were subjected to gene function enrichment and pathway analysis in the Ingenuity w software ( www . ingenuity . com ( 27 January 2014 , date last accessed ) ) as described in Grøn - dahl et al . ( 2010 , 2013 ) . Furthermore , an upstream regulator analysis ( Inge - nuity w Systems ) was performed to reveal potential regulators of the observed effect of the rhCG triggering . Validation of differential expression by external macaque ovulation data set ThedatasetGSE22776wasdownloadedfromhttp : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / ( 27 January 2014 , date last accessed ) . The data set contains 22 samples from Macaque periovulatory follicles of which 10 samples were used in this study . These ﬁles are : GSM563219 . CELGSM563220 . CEL - GSM563221 . CEL - GSM563222 . CEL - GSM563223 . CEL - GSM563224 . CEL - GSM563233 . CE - L - GSM563234 . CEL - GSM563235 . CEL - GSM563236 . CEL , representing follicles before and 36 h after exposure to an ovulatory rhCG dose . TheCEL ﬁles wereimportedintoR and RMA normalized . Theexpression matrix was exported to dChip ( www . dchip . org ( 27 January 2014 , date last accessed ) ) and used as basis of cluster visualization of genes , which were found to be differentially expressed in our data . Two thousand and seventy - nine redundant Macaque probe sets ( a par - ticular gene was represented more than once in the gene list ) were overlap - pingbetweentheMacaqueGenearraysandthepresentHumanGenearrays , based on the gene symbolof the 1186 unique genes thatwere deﬁned as dif - ferentiallyexpressed . Thisgenelistwasﬁlteredtoexcludegenes ( probesets ) intheprimatedatathatshowedonlya small relativevariationacrosssamples ( 0 . 05 , SD / mean , 1000 . 00 ) . The 786 overlapping probe sets ( 513 unique genes ) that were left after the ﬁltering were used in a two - way hierarchical cluster visualization using the Qlucore Omics Explorer version 2 . 3 software ( www . glucore . com ) with average linkage ( Supplementary data , Table SII ) . Results Differentially expressed genes Unsupervised principal component analysis ( PCA ) revealed that the samples clustered within each of the two time frames and demonstrated general difference in the transcriptome in the GC before and after rhCG triggering ( Fig . 1A ) . Setting the criteria for being differentially expressed in the paired t - test to P , 0 . 0001 ( false discovery rate ( FDR ) : 0 . 0012 ) and a fold change exceeding 2 , a total of 1224 probe sets ( 1186 unique genes ) were found to be differentially expressed with 572 genes being up - regulated and 614 genes down - regulated in the two types of GC ( cluster diagram in Fig . 1B ) . Table I presents a selected list of differentially expressed genes including known reproduction genes , genes representing enriched functions and genes selected based on high fold change . The full list of differentially expressed genes ( fold change . 2 , P , 0 . 0001 ) is shown in Supplementary data , Table SIII . Conﬁrmation of array data by qRT - PCR analysis of selected genes qRT - PCR of 11 selected genes in 7 paired samples of GC before / after rhCG demonstrated agreement with the microarray data ( Fig . 2 ) . Human granulosa cell transcriptome and ovulation 999 Comparison with macaque whole follicle database before and 36 h after rhCG Toexaminetherelevanceofthepresentdatatoeventsinanaturalcycle , the 1186 signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes reported in this paper were compared with the gene set generated by Xu et al . ( 2011 ) from macaques in their natural cycle before and 36 h after hCG trigger - ing . This revealed that the macaque data included 786 overlapping probes ( 513 unique genes ) with a differential expression pattern before and after rhCG , which resembled the expression pattern detected in our human data ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary data , Table SII ) . Gene function enrichment analysis The top ‘Molecular and Cellular Function’ and the top ‘Disease and Dis - order’ enriched in the differentially expressed genes were Cell Cycle ( P ¼ 1 . 7E 2 25 ; 132genes ) and Cancer ( P ¼ 1 . 5E 2 25 ; 435genes ) , respective - ly . Seventy - two genes previously described in connection with ovarian cancer were among the highly regulated genes according to the Ingenui - ty w enrichment analysis ( Supplementary data , Table SIV ) . Expression of cellcycle - relatedgeneswashighlydown - regulated36 hafterthebolusof rhCG while inﬂammation and coagulation related genes were highly up - regulated after rhCG . The ‘Top Canonical Pathway analysis’ listed in Table II likewise underlined these central mechanisms represented in the up - and down - regulated genes . In the following sections , the results are highlighted with special em - phasis on ovarian physiology and new genes in reproduction . For a brief overview , please refer to Fig . 4 . New ovulation - related genes in humans Manyofthehighlyregulatedgeneswerepreviouslyunrelatedtoovulation , such as , for example , the highly up - regulated CD24 ( CD24 protein ) , ANKDR22 ( ankyrin repeat domain 22 ) , TECRL ( trans - 2 , 3 - enoyl - CoA reductase - like ) , FBXO32 ( F - box protein 32 ) , FLRT2 ( ﬁbronectin leucine richtransmembraneprotein2 ) , CLDN11 ( claudin11 ) andthehighlydown - regulated CEP55 ( Centrosomalprotein55 kDa ) and H19 / mir675 ( micro - RNA 675 ) ( Table I ) . Steroidogenesis and gonadotrophin receptors The FF hormone concentrations before and after rhCG triggering are listed in Table III . The FF estrogen concentration decreased signiﬁcantly afterrhCGwithaconcomitantdecreasein CYP19A1 ( cytochromeP450 , family 19 , subfamily A , polypeptide 1 ) expression . The FF androstene - dione concentration decreased signiﬁcantly after rhCG , accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the theca cell - speciﬁc CYP17A1 ( cyto - chrome P450 , family 17 , subfamily A , polypeptide 1 ) . The FF progester - one concentration and StAR expression ( P ¼ 0 . 00031 , fold change 2 . 7 ) increased after rhCG as expected , while at time points before and 36 h after rhCG , gene expression of genes promoting progesteronesyn - thesis HSD3B2 ( hydroxy - delta - 5 - steroid dehydrogenase , 3 beta - and steroid delta - isomerase 2 ) , LDLR ( low density lipoprotein receptor ) and CYP11A1 ( cytochrome P450 , family 17 , subfamily A , polypeptide 1 ) were unaltered . Testosterone concentrations before and after rhCG were unaltered as was HSD17B ( 17 b - hydroxysteroid dehydro - genase ) expression .

Exit from cell cycle Cyclins were down - regulated concomitantly with an increase in cell cycle inhibitors ( CDKN1A , alias p21 cip , cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ) . Other genes marking actively dividing cells , such as TOP2A ( topo - isomerase 2 alpha ) , CDC20 ( cell division cycle 20 ) and the MCM’s ( mini - chromosome maintenance complex components ) were dramatically down - regulated ( Table I and Supplementary data , Table SIII ) . Inﬂammation , angiogenesis and coagulation Many inﬂammation - related genes were highly up - regulated after rhCG , such as genes involved in prostaglandin synthesis : PTSG2 ( prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 ) , PTGES ( prostaglandin E synthase ) , PLA2G4A ( phospholipase A2 , group 4A ) and the leukotriene - producing enzymes from the lipoxygenase pathway ALOX5 ( arachidonate 5 lipoxygenase ) and ALOX5AP ( arachidonate 5 - lipoxygenase - activating protein ) ( Table I and Supplementary data , Table SIII ) Genesinvolvedininterleukinsignalingandacutephaseresponsewere also highly represented among the up - regulated genes ( Table II ) . Genes promoting angiogenesis and invasiveness , such as CD24 and EFNB3 ( ephrin B3 ) , were among the highly up - regulated genes . ANGPT1 ( angiopoietin 1 ) was also up - regulated while VEGFA ( vascular endothelial growth factor A ) was down - regulated ( Table I ) . Further , genes involved with coagulation , such as F3 ( coagulation factor III ) and F2R ( coagulation factor II receptor ) , were up - regulated ( Table I ) .

Human granulosa cell transcriptome and ovulation 1003 neighbor H19 / mir675 ( microRNA 675 ) were signiﬁcantly down - regulated after rhCG ( Table I ) . Transcription factors and upstream regulators EGR1 and EGR2 ( earlygrowthresponse ) werehighlyinducedbyrhCGas was JUN ( junproto - oncogene ) and c - FOS ( FBJmurineosteosarcomaviral oncogene homolog ) . FOXL2 ( forkhead box L2 ) was signiﬁcantly down - regulated ( Table I ) . The in silico upstream regulator analysis suggested FSH , LH as well as PGR ( progesterone receptor ) , ESR1 ( estrogen receptor 1 ) and AR ( androgen receptor ) as top upstream regulators of the rhCG trigger induced changes . Furthermore , various pro - inﬂammatory cytokines ( i . e . TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) , IL6 ( interleukin - 6 ) ) , growth factors ( i . e . IGF1 , IGF2 ( insulin - like growth factors 1 and 2 ) , EGF ( epidermal growth factor ) , PGDF b ( platelet - derived growth factor b ) as well as cell cycle regulators ( i . e .

Discussion This human transcriptome dataset will serve as an easily accessible source for the study of ovulation - related genes in humans . A unique and highly signiﬁcant difference was demonstrated in human GC expressed genes obtained from the same women in the same cycle in two hallmarks of folliculogenesis : before and after the ovulatory surge of rhCG for ﬁnal oocyte maturation . A total of 1186 genes were highly signiﬁcantly differentially expressed , among those were many genes previously not related to ovulation and interestingly , several of those are reported as related to cancer . The criteria for differential expression were strict ( FC . 2 , P , 0 . 0001 , FDR , 0 . 012 ) ; hence , some important ovulation - related genes might have been overlooked . However , our approach in this study was to describe the most signiﬁcantly differentially expressed ovulation - related genes and pathways . In addition to qRT - PCR conﬁrmation , our data and model were further validated by a high overlap to differently expressed genes observed in whole follicles from macaque monkeys collected at the same time points as in our study ( Xu et al . , 2011 ) . The monkeys were in their natural menstrual cycle and the high overlap may indicate that the data obtained in the present study also represent changes occurring in natural ovulation in humans . This overlap is an important external val - idation of the data set since the aspiration of a follicle prior to hCG injec - tion hypothetically could induce the formation of an early CL with local and systemic effects potentially inﬂuencing the GC transcriptome at 36 h after hCG . In the following sections , the data will be discussed in the context of known ovarian physiology as well as extended in light of the many new ovulation - related genes found in this study . Figure 2 Validation of microarray results by qRT - PCR in 11 selected genes in 7pairedsamples ofGC prior to and 36 h afterrhCG triggering . All validated genes were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed before compared with after rhCG in the qRT - PCR experiment ( P - values , ratio paired t - test ) : CD24 : P ¼ 0 . 0069 , AREG : P ¼ 0 . 0015 , PTGS2 : P ¼ 0 . 0004 , COL6A3 : P ¼ 0 . 0007 , HSD11B1 : P ¼ 0 . 0001 , HSD11B2 : P ¼ 0 . 0132 , INHBA : P ¼ 0 . 0012 , CCNA2 : P ¼ 0 . 0037 , PTTG1 : P ¼ 0 . 0049 , IGF2 : P ¼ 0 . 0064 and CYP19A1 : P ¼ 0 . 0010 .

Steroidogenesis and gonadotrophin receptors To the best of our knowledge this study is the ﬁrst to show concentra - tions of steroids in follicles from the same women collected just prior to and 36 h afterovulation induction . This provided detailed information on the profound changes that occurred in steroidogenesis in connection with ovulation and the hormonal proﬁle of the FFs supported the gene expressiondata . Theexpressionof CYP17A1 and NR5A1 ( nuclearrecep - tor subfamily 5 , group A , member 1 ) indicated minor theca cell contam - ination , which , however , did not seem to affect the overall results of this studyconﬁrmingrecentbovinedataonminorthecacellcontaminationof GC preparations from follicle aspirates ( Christenson et al . , 2013 ) . As in humans , macaques ovulate around 36 h after hCG administration . In macaque whole follicles , an increase in StAR and HSD3B2 was found 12 h after hCG induced ovulation , but decreased to pre - hCG levels 36 h after hCG in non - ruptured follicles and increased again in ruptured follicles , revealingabiphasicpatternofthegeneexpressionoftheproges - togenic pathway ( Xu et al . , 2011 ) . As we found unaltered levels of HSD3B2 , LDLR ( low density lipoprotein receptor ) , CYP11A1 36 h after ovulation but increased levels of progesterone in FF , we speculate that inhumanstherecouldbeasimilarbiphasicexpressionpatternofthepro - gestogenic pathway in the periovulatory interval . The early increase of the progestogenic pathway could be important for locally induced actionsofprogesteroneinthefolliclewhereasthelaterincreaseafterfol - licle rupture facilitates CL formation and progesterone production for systemic as well as local purposes ( Xu et al . , 2011 ) . Additional radical changes in steroidogenesis occur during the periovulatory period . The decreaseof CYP171 ( catalyzing androgenproduction ) and CYP19A ( con - verting androstenedione to estrogen ) accompanied FF hormone changes and reﬂected the shift from estrogenic to progestogenic follicles after rhCG . The opposite expression patterns of HSD11B1 ( up - regulation ; pro - moting cortisol production from cortisone ) and HSD11B2 ( down - regulation , promoting cortisone production from cortisol ) conﬁrmed previous ﬁndings in humans ( Yding Andersen et al . , 1999 ) and in macaque whole follicles ( Fru et al . , 2006 ) .

Exit from cell cycle TheLH / hCGsurgeinducesdown - regulationofcellcyclegenes , inorder to decrease GC proliferation and promote ﬁnal GC differentiation ( Stocco et al . , 2007 ) . Down - regulation of cell cycle genes and prolifer - ation marker genes as CDC20 , TOP2A and the MCM ’s were in line with a previous report showing a decline of macaque GC entering S - phase 24 h after rhCG ( Fru et al . , 2007 ) and inhibition of GC mitosis in macaque ovaries by a bolus of rhCG ( Chafﬁn et al . , 2001 ) . Additionally , expression of cell cycle inhibitor genes as CDKN1A was increased after rhCG as reported in rodents ( Stocco et al . , 2007 ) and macaques ( Chafﬁn et al . , 2001 ) . In macaques , CDKN1A increased early ( 12 h ) after the ovulatory trigger whereas CDKN1B expression increased later ( at 36 h ) ( Chafﬁn et al . , 2001 ) . CDKN1B expression was also dominant in rodent corpora lutea ( Stocco et al . , 2007 ) . This suggested that CDKN1A is important for the initial decline in GC mitosis while CDKN1B might maintain cell cycle arrest in the luteinized cells of the CL . This could explain why we only observed an up - regulation of CDKN1A . Inﬂammation In line with ovulation being compared with an acute inﬂammatory reac - tion in the ovary ( Espey , 2006 ) we demonstrated an up - regulation of genes involved in inﬂammation , such as immune cell trafﬁcking , interleukin - signaling , TNF a activationandprostaglandinsynthesis . Inpri - mates , prostaglandins are critical for ovulation , but not for luteinisation ( Duffy and Stouffer , 2002 ) . In the present data set , PTGS2 was found to be heavily up - regulated ( . 13 - fold ) . The speciﬁc PTGS2 inhibitor cel - ecoxib has been shown to increase the incidence of delayed rupture of follicles and unruptured follicles in humans , but not as effectively as in monkeys , suggesting that in humans , there are other pathways ensuring follicle rupture ( Duffy and Stouffer , 2002 ) . In humans , the lipoxygenase pathway could , as for other species ( Downey et al . , 1998 ; Mikuni et al . , 1998 ) play a role in ovulation as well , as we found an up - regulation of Figure 4 The human ovulatory cascade .

The increased expression of coagulation factors ( F2R , F3 ) , promoting coagulation in the microvasculature , extended previous ﬁndings in mice of increased F3 expression shortly after hCG triggering ( Carletti and Christenson , 2009 ) .

Human granulosa cell transcriptome and ovulation 1007 shifttowardsaninvasivephenotype . EFNB2 ( up - regulated . 15 - foldinGC 36 h after rhCG ) and other ephrins were previously reported to be expressed in human luteinized GC ( Xu et al . , 2006 ) . Blocking EFNB2 with highly speciﬁc antibodies inhibited angiogenesis , lymphangiogenesis and tumor growth in a xenografted mice model ( Abe´ngozar et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , ephrins may be important for the induction of angiogenesis inthe developingCL inhumans . Thereduced VEGFA ( vascularendothelial growthfactorA ) expressioncouldresemblethepatternofVEGFAexpres - sioninthe primateperiovulatory follicle , withatemporary decreasein ex - pressionafterhCGfollowedbyariseafterfolliclerupture ( Xu etal . , 2011 ) . Many ovulation - related genes have previously been associated with cancer and ovarian cancer . This suggests that some forms of ovarian cancer could originate from ovulatory molecular processes that have gone astray , supported by the fact that ovarian epithelial tumors devel - oped and maintained a milieu rich in pro - inﬂammatory chemokines and cytokines ( reviewed in Maccio ` and Madeddu , 2012 ) which resembledthelocalinﬂammatoryreactioninthefollicleduringovulation . CD24 expression in ovarian cancer was related to tumor aggressiveness , especiallycellinvasionandchemotacticmigration ( Kang etal . , 2013 ) . The massiveup - regulationof CD24 expressionfollowingrhCGexposurewas new and unexpected . It enforces an association between CD24 , vascu - larizationandangiogenesischaracterizingCLformation . Thepresentob - servation calls for further investigations to determine the precise role of CD24intheseprocesses . CLDN11 , highlyup - regulatedbyrhCGandnot previously related to ovulation , was overexpressed in ovarian cancer , promoting cancer cell invasion ( Aravindakshan et al . , 2006 ( mice ) ; English and Santin , 2013 ) . TGF - b 1 has been proposed asa local regulatorofmicrovascularangio - genesis ( Maroni and Davis , 2011 ) and has also beenproposedasafacilita - tor of CL formation in pigs ( Sriperumbudur et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , ovarian epithelial cancer cell lines have shown to be refractory to TGF - b 1 signaling through loss of expression of TGF - b 1 / SMAD4 targets FBXO32 and RUNX1 T ( Chou et al . , 2010 ) . FBXO32 was among the highlyup - regulatedgenesdescribedherefortheﬁrsttimeasbeinginvolved in human ovulation . Hence , TGF - b 1 and its target genes could serve as a control mechanism of the invasive process of CL formation . AnactivatingFOXL2mutationhasbeendescribedinadultovarianepi - thelialtumors ( Ko¨bel etal . , 2009 ) , andbesidesthetargetgenesStARand CYP19A1 , FOXL2 has pleiotropic effects in TGF - b / SMAD signaling . The down - regulation of FOXL2 36 h after rhCG further underlined the tightly regulated ovulation process . Extracellular matrix remodeling and cell to cell contact An abundance of proteases have been implicated in ovulation , such as the Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , Tissue inhibitor of metalloprotei - nase ( TIMPs ) , A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinasewith Trombospondin Motifs ( ADAMTSs ) , serine proteases and cathepsin L . ADAMTS1 has been shown to play a central role in human ovulation ( Yung et al . , 2010 ) . Here , we report for the ﬁrst time that ADAMTS9 is also massively induced by rhCG in human GC , in line with ﬁndings in macaque ( Peluffo etal . , 2011 ) . ADAMTS1 , cathepsinL , MMP - 1andTIMP - 1areup - regulated by progesterone in the primate ovary ( Chafﬁn , 1999 ) . We found MMP5 and TIMP1 tobeup - regulatedwhile TIMP3 wasdown - regulated , underlin - ing the complexity and species differences of the process . Other extracellular matrix genes that were highly up - regulated after the ovulatory surge , such as COL6A3 have previously been reported in human theca cells ( Iwahashi et al . , 2000 ) and in murine cumulus cells and GC in response to rhCG ( Adriaenssens et al . , 2009 ) . We have shown for the ﬁrst time in human GC that COL6A3 expression increased massively after the ovulatory surge . COL6A3 could be an important factor in the ovulatory process and in CL formation . ANKRD22 , coding for a membrane integrated protein ankyrin repeat domain 2 2 with no known biological function , was highly up - regulated in the post - rhCG GC . A recent comparison of the transcriptome of cor - responding cumulus and GC on individual preovulatory follicle level found ANKRD22 expression to be low in cumulus cells , while up to 17 - fold higher expressed in GC ( Grøndahl et al . , 2012 ) . This indicates a specialized , yet unknown function in the GC - compartment . Growth factors Epidermalgrowthfactor ( EGF ) - familymembersareinducedbyLH / hCG and propagate the LH / hCG stimulus in a autocrine and paracrine manner ( Conti et al . , 2006 ) . Both AREG ( amphiregulin ) and EREG ( epir - egulin ) expression washighly increasedafter rhCG , as expected ( Zamah etal . , 2010 ) . INHBA ( Inhibin b A ) wassigniﬁcantlyreduced , extending the ﬁndingsofHua etal . , ( 2008 ) whofounddecreasedINHBAinresponseto hCG in murine follicles cultured in vitro . The insulin - like growth factors ( IGF1 and 2 ) are important intra - ovarian growth factors . IGF2 enhances FSH - induced GC prolifer - ation and steroidogenesis ( Mazerbourg et al . 2003 ) . IGF2 and the genomic neighbor H19 / mir675 were substantially reduced 36 h after rhCG administration in the present study , conﬁrming previous ﬁndings in primate ovary of reduced Igf2 expression after hCG ( Brogan et al . 2010 ) . IGF2 - H19 is a tandem gene , whose dual expression is regulated by imprinting : IGF2 is a growth - promoting peptide while H19 / mir675 gives rise to several non - coding microRNAs that inhibit cell proliferation ( Ratajczak , 2012 ) . H19 / mir675 was previously shown to reduce Igf1 re - ceptormRNA ( Keniry etal . 2012 ) , andinterestingly , IGF1R wasincreased 1 . 4 times ( P ¼ 0 . 0005 ) in the present study . The dramatic down - regulation of H19 / mir675 after rhCG suggests thatH19 / mir675 regula - tion plays an important role during ovulation that remains to be further elucidated . TheroleofAMHinthelatephasesoffolliculogenesisremainsunsettled ( Andersen etal . , 2010 ) . Thedecreasein AMHR2 expressionconﬁrmedthe effectofﬁnalmaturationinhumancumulus – oocytecomplexeswithlower AMHR2 expressionincumuluscells fromexpanded versus non - expanded cumulus cells ( Grøndahl et al . , 2011 ) and lower AMHR2 expression after hCG in rat cumulus – oocyte complexes ( Agca et al . , 2012 ) . Higher FF AMH at oocyte retrieval has been linked to decreased pregnancy chance after in vitro fertilisation ( Desforges - Bullet et al . , 2010 ) , suggesting that reduced AMH signaling is important for ﬁnal follicular maturation . Our ﬁndings of decreased AMH in FF after rhCG support recent ﬁndings ofdecreasedserumAMHlevelsthroughtheperiovulatoryintervalandthe luteal phase ( Hadlow et al . , 2013 ) . Oocyte competence marker genes are found in the follicular to luteal transition expression proﬁle Severalofthegenesdifferentiallyexpressed , beforeandafterrhCG , have been suggested as follicular health markers . Hamel et al . ( 2010 ) 1008 Wissing et al . performedthreeconsecutivegeneexpressionstudiesusingGCobtained in connection with OPU , comparing GC from follicles yielding oocytes that resulted in live birth versus GC from follicles resulting in no preg - nancy . Interestingly , four of the nine proposed follicle health markers overlapped with our gene set of differentially expressed genes before and after rhCG ( RGS2 , CYP19A1 , UGP2 ( UDP - glucose pyrophosphory - lase 2 ) and PHLDA1 ( pleckstrin homology - like domain , family A , member 1 ) ) . Furthermore , we observed an overlap of our differentially expressed genes and reported cumulus cell marker genes : EFNB2 ( Wathlet et al . , 2012 ) , PTGS2 , PTX3 , HAS2 ( Gebhardt et al . , 2011 ) , RGS2 , ANKRD22 and PLIN2 ( perilipin 2 ) ( Feuerstein et al . , 2012 ) . This overlap underlined the importance of the ﬁnal maturational process induced by hCG / LH and downstream signals for the compe - tence of the oocyte to undertake further development , and indicated that ovulation - related genes may serve as good markers of follicle and oocyte quality . Conclusion Onethousandonehundredandeighty - sixgenesweresigniﬁcantlydiffer - entially expressed when comparing GC isolated before and 36 h after rhCG administration and GC from these two hallmarks of folliculogen - esis represent highly distinct gene expression proﬁles . Known ovulation - related genes were conﬁrmed and many new ovulation - related genes were discovered , such as CD24 , FBXO32 , ANKRD22 , CLDN11 and H19 / mir675 . Up - regulated genes represented inﬂammation , angiogenesis , extra - cellular matrix and growth factors . Down - regulated genes represented cell cycle and proliferation . Seventy - two of the regulated genes had pre - viously been related to ovarian cancer . FF hormone analyses conﬁrmed the shift from estrogenic to progestogenic and further , a signiﬁcant de - crease in FF AMH after rhCG was documented . These data will serve as an easily accessible resource of GC genes involved in human ovulation and ﬁnal oocyte maturation . The identiﬁca - tion of enriched genes , pathways and intermediate regulators of the ﬁnal follicle maturation is essential for understanding the complicated ovula - tory process in more detail and the function of all the individual compo - nents involved .
