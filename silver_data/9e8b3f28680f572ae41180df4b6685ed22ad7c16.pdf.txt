Candida glabrata was found to be acutely susceptible to seven killer toxins produced by Saccharomyces species of yeasts . Specifically , the ionophoric K1 and K2 killer toxins were broadly inhibitory to a large collection of C . glabrata from patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis . The sensitivity of these clinical isolates to killer toxins does not correlate with their resistance to major classes of antifungal drugs . RESEARCH FINDINGS Vulvovaginal candidiasis ( VVC ) is estimated to afflict two in every three women worldwide at some point in their lives causing significant suffering and associated economic losses [ 1 – 3 ] . Candida albicans is most often isolated as the dominant species present in cases of VVC , followed by Candida glabrata , which is the second most prevalent cause of VVC [ 4 ] . Additionally , in certain diabetic patient populations C . glabrata is the dominant yeast species associated with VVC [ 5 , 6 ] . The frontline treatment for VVC is oral doses of fungistatic fluconazole . However , drug - resistant Candida yeasts can result in treatment failure and longer courses of suppressive treatment [ 7 – 9 ] . To relieve symptoms of VVC and to prevent Candida - associated complications during pregnancy , topical application of azoles is preferred over oral formulations of azole due to the potential for fetal toxicity during the first trimester [ 10 ] . However , the efficacy of azoles is reduced in the acidic environment of the vagina [ 11 ] . The limited availability of effective non - toxic therapies to treat VVC warrants the exploration of novel therapeutics that are active at the low pH of the vagina . Killer toxins produced by Saccharomyces “killer” yeasts are optimally active at acidic pHs that overlap the average pH of the vaginal mucosa ( pH ~ 4 . 5 ) . In addition , there have been many publications that have described killer yeasts that can inhibit the growth of pathogenic yeasts [ 12 – 17 ] . Given the relatively recent discovery of several novel killer toxins produced by Saccharomyces yeasts , 15 species of pathogenic Candida yeasts were assayed for their susceptibility to the killer toxins K1 , K1L , K2 , K21 / K66 , K45 , K62 , and K74 [ 18 – 24 ] . A well assay was used to inoculate killer yeasts into pH 4 . 6 buffered agar plates seeded with lawns of pathogenic Candida yeasts ( Figure S1 ) . After three days of incubation at room temperature , growth inhibition was identified by the appearance of yeast - free zones and halos of oxidized methylene blue around killer yeasts . Of the 15 species of yeasts challenged , C . glabrata appeared to be the most susceptible to killer toxins produced by 6 of the 9 killer yeasts assayed , followed by C . nivarensis and C . bracarensis , which are all human pathogenic species of the Nakaseomyces genus ( Figure 1A and B ) . Figure 1 . Candida glabrata is more susceptible to killer toxins than other species of Candida yeasts . ( A ) The number of killer yeasts that inhibit the growth of different species of pathogenic yeasts . ( B ) Representative agar plug assay plates with nine different types of killer yeasts seeded with C . glabrata , C . nivarensis , and C . bracarensis . ( C ) The percentage of Candida yeast species inhibited by each type of killer toxin . As killer toxin susceptibility can vary widely within a species , the unique sensitivity of C . glabrata to nine different killer toxins was further investigated in 53 primary clinical isolates from the human vagina . Killer yeasts were pinned onto agar plates ( YPD , pH 4 . 6 ) seeded with lawns of C . glabrata and qualitatively assayed for growth inhibition and methylene blue straining . Of the 477 interactions measured between killer yeasts and C . glabrata , it was observed that killer yeasts producing the ionophoric killer toxins K1 , K2 , and K45 were inhibitory to 100 % , 96 % , and 75 % of C . glabrata isolates , respectively ( Figure 2A ) . The remaining killer toxins affected the growth and viability of less than 33 % of isolates . Curiously , a recently identified homolog of K1 named K1L was only able to inhibit the growth of 32 % of clinical isolates suggesting that C . glabrata is not broadly susceptible to all ionophoric killer toxins . The susceptibility of C . glabrata to K1 and K2 greatly contrasts the widespread killer toxin resistance observed by different strains of Saccharomyces yeasts ( Figure 2A ) . To test the susceptibility of clinical isolates of C . glabrata with acute killer toxin exposure , K1 and K2 toxins were enriched from spent culture media by ammonium sulfate precipitation [ 24 ] . Application of toxins to lawns seeded with 1 × 10 5 of C . glabrata yeast cells demonstrated their concentration - dependent susceptibility by measuring the zone of growth inhibition and methylene blue staining ( Figure 2B ) . The mean antifungal activity of K1 with 95 % confidence was typified by both zones of growth inhibition ( with 95 % confidence ) ( 92 . 34 mm 2 ± 11 . 24 ) and halos of methylene blue staining ( 41 . 44 mm 2 ± 4 . 98 ) , and K2 resulted in zones of growth inhibition ( 58 . 48 mm 2 ± 11 . 91 ) and large zones of methylene blue staining ( 185 . 68 mm 2 ± 28 . 66 ) ( Figure 2B ) . Importantly , we observe only a weak correlation ( Spearman’s correlation coefficient R 2 = 0 . 31 ) between inhibition of C . glabrata by K1 and K2 , indicating different mechanisms of intoxication ( Figure S2 ) . Using the Kirby - Bauer disk diffusion assay to measure mean growth inhibition ( in mm 2 with 95 % confidence ) , it was determined that many of the clinical isolates of C . glabrata had variable resistance to the antifungal drugs fluconazole ( 1 . 21 mm 2 ± 1 . 06 ) , ketoconazole ( 18 . 78 mm 2 ± 1 . 67 ) clotrimazole ( 5 . 82 mm 2 ± 1 . 30 ) , amphotericin B ( 11 . 24 mm 2 ± 0 . 21 ) , and caspofungin ( 25 . 25 mm 2 ± 0 . 29 ) ( Figure S3 ) . The observed variation in the inhibition of C . glabrata by K1 and K2 in Figure 2B did not correlate with the varying susceptibility of clinical isolates to these antifungal drugs ( Figure 2C ) . Figure 2 . Clinical isolates of C . glabrata from the vaginal mucosa are most susceptible to the ionophoric killer toxins K1 and K2 .

( B ) Box and whisker plot showing the median killer toxin activity based on the size of the total area of inhibition , zones of complete growth inhibition ( clear ) or methylene blue staining ( blue ) around killer yeasts for three concentrations of K1 and K2 killer toxins . ( C ) Spearman ' s correlation analysis of the relationship between the susceptibility of C . glabrata to killer toxins and the clinical antifungal drugs clotrimazole ( CLO , 50 µ g ) , caspofungin ( CAS , 5 µ g ) , amphotericin B ( AMB , 20 µ g ) , ketoconazole ( KCA , 15 µ g ) , and fluconazole ( FLU , 25 µ g ) . CONCLUSION We have found that C . glabrata is susceptible to a diversity of killer toxins produced by Saccharomyces yeasts and that K1 and K2 are broadly antifungal to primary clinical isolates from the vaginal mucosa . This work updates our understanding of the interaction of killer toxins with pathogenic species of Candida yeasts and demonstrates the value of screening multiple isolates of a pathogenic species to identify broad - spectrum antifungal activities . The antifungal mechanism of K1 and K2 are both thought to involve the attack of the fungal membrane and ion leakage [ 25 ] . Thus , we expect that the plasma membrane is the site of K1 and K2 action against C . glabrata resulting in cell lysis and apoptosis [ 26 ] . Further work will be required to confirm the mechanism of action of ionophoric toxins against C . glabrata and to explore the molecular determinants of the observed unique susceptibility .
