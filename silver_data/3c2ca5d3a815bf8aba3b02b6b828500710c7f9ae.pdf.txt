Key words : Aha ! reaction ; Anteriorcingulate cortex ( ACC ) ; Event - related fMRI ; Leftlateralprefrontal cortex ( PFC ) INTRODUCTION The ‘Aha ! reaction’ is the familiar abrupt change in mental perspective that leads one to the solution of an otherwise intractable problem . Auble and colleagues were first to introduce a sentence comprehension task as a way of evoking such a reaction in the laboratory [ 1 ] . In their experiment , subjects read ambiguous sentences followed by a solution cue . In the difficult - to - comprehend condition , two aspects of the sentence appeared incomprehensible without the solution cue . For example , in the sentence ‘The haystack was important because the cloth ripped’ , the link between haystack and cloth is not obvious , because subjects usually suppose that cloth refers to something wearable . This assumption is so dominating that it is difficult if not impossible for a subject to interpret the word in any other way . An Aha ! reaction is evoked with the solution cue parachute , which triggers the alternative interpretation that cloth refers to canopy and therefore the role of the haystack is to cushion a fall . By contrast , in the easy - to - comprehend condition , the two aspects of the sentence were highly correlated in daily life , so that subjects understood the situation without seeing the solution cue ( e . g . ‘The office was cool because the windows were closed’ – ‘air - condi - tioner’ ) . Therefore , the solution cue in the easy - to - compre - hend condition does not elicit an Aha ! reaction . A component process of an Aha ! reaction is breaking mental impasse . This process differs from semantic integra - tion , which underlies N400 , in several ways [ 2 ] . First , an Aha ! reaction involves an impasse – insight sequence [ 3 ] , whereas semantic integration does not . Second , in an Aha ! reaction , the solution cue fits well within the context of the ambiguous sentence , whereas with semantic integration the final word does not typically fit within the context of sentence . Third , an Aha ! reaction arises from dramatic representational change by reforming the relationships between the essential components into new scripts . In semantic integration , modifications are made within the frame of the original script . Breaking mental impasse also differs from cognitive set shifting in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task ( WCST ) . In the WCST , subjects are able to implement some general principles because the basis of card sorting is repeatedly switched among several dimensions ( e . g . , color , shape , or number ) , whereas in breaking mental impasse , this kind of task - general strategy is not possible . To break a mental impasse , subjects need to detect and resolve cognitive conflict . Conflict detection in the para - chute example is realizing one’s error in interpreting cloth as something wearable and detecting the conflicts between different scripts to interpret the sentence ( i . e . parachute jumping script vs other daily life scripts ) . Conflict resolution is selecting an alternative for which the causal relation becomes apparent F the parachuted ripped , so the haystack became important for breaking the fall . Previous studies have shown that anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) imple - ments conflict detection . Although ACC was typically activated by the co - occurrence of competing motor re - sponses on incongruent trials of the Stroop and Flanker tasks [ 4 ] , it was also activated in the verb - generation task when the production of verbs that were weak associates , rather than , strong associates of particular nouns [ 5 ] . ACC was also activated in the tip of the tongue ( TOT ) state that involved a conflict between the metacognitive level and the cognitive level [ 6 ] . Therefore , it is possible that ACC is involved in an Aha ! reaction when there is a conflict between the prepotent response and a logical , meaningful resolution to the problem . An Aha ! reaction may also involve lateral prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , as this region has also been linked to conflict resolution in working memory BRAINIMAGING N EURO R EPORT 0959 - 4965 (cid:1) c Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Vol 15 No 13 15 September 2004 2 013 Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins .

We predict that lateral PFC participates in the Aha ! reaction and subserves the process of semantic selection and attentional set regulation . MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects : Fifteen healthy , right - handed volunteers ( five female ) , aged 20 – 43 ( mean 26 . 7 ) years , participated in this experiment . The data for two subjects were not used because they indicated they could not understand the solution cue to most of the ambiguous sentences . Subjects were given informed consent in accordance with the MRI ethics committee guidelines of the Neuroscience Research Institute , AIST . Materials : The 42 pairs of ambiguous sentences and their solution cues used in this study were mostly taken from Auble et al . ’s study [ 1 ] . Some sentences were modified due to cultural differences , and additional sentences were also constructed . All sentences and their solution cues were evaluated as highly reasonable and interesting by another group of subjects who did not attend the fMRI experiment . The classification of items into those that evoked an Aha ! reaction was determined by the subject’s on - line response during scanning and subsequent evaluation of post - scan questionnaires . To control the ratio of Aha vs non - Aha trials , about half of the 42 ambiguity sentences were difficult - to - comprehend ( and so the presentation of the solution cues tended to evoke the Aha ! reaction ) and the other half were easy - to - comprehend . This partitioning was also evaluated by the experimenters and another group of subjects . Examples of difficult - to - comprehend sentences were : ‘His position went up because his partner’s position went down ( See - saw ) ’ . ‘Her eyebrows fell below her eyes because her muscles tensed ( Handstand ) ’ . ‘You could not tell who it was , because a professional took the photo of that old man ( X - rays ) ’ . Examples of easy - to - comprehend sentences were : ‘He burned the paper because the sunlight was well focused ( Magnifying glass ) ’ . ‘The coffee was sweet because the powder was added ( Sugar ) ’ . Procedure : In the sentence presentation phase , each am - biguous sentence was presented for 8s . Within this period , subjects pressed a key to indicate whether or not they could understand the sentence ( left key / index finger of right hand : yes ; right key / middle finger of right hand : no ) . After pressing a key , they were requested to cease thinking about the sentence . After sentence presentation there was a 7 s unfilled delay , followed by presentation of the solution cue for 2s , followed by a 4 7 1 s unfilled delay . Subjects were required to press a key as early as possible to indicate whether they understood the solution cue or not . 42 items were randomly assigned to three blocks with 14 items in each block . There was 30 s rest between blocks . After subjects left the MRI machine ( 2 – 5min after the puzzle solving stage ) , they were required to answer a questionnaire on how they comprehended each sentence . They were asked to indicate whether or not they understood the ambiguous sentence before seeing the solution cue ; whether or not they understood the solution cue ; and if so how easy / difficult it was to understand ; subjects were also required to report the reason for their failure in the initial stage of ambiguous sentence presentation . An Aha event was defined when the presentation of the solution cue evoked a sudden understanding about the sentence , after subject had failed in the initial stage . If during the initial stage the subject had obtained an under - standing that was consistent with the solution cue , then a non - Aha event was defined . If the solution cue differed from the subject’s understanding in a way that triggered better comprehension on the sentence , then it was also regarded as an Aha event . To simplify the underlying processes involved in the Aha ! reaction , such an event was defined only when the meaning of the solution cue was judged as obvious to understand . Cases judged as under - standable , but fairly hard , were regarded as difficult solution events , but not Aha events . In the present study , we focused primarily on brain activity during the proces - sing of solution cues . Critically , we contrasted the proces - sing of solution cues that evoked the Aha ! reaction with the processing of solutions that did not . All classifications of events were done according to the subject’s on - line responses with fMRI scanning and their post - scan evaluations . If there was an inconsistency between on - line response and post - scan evaluation , the judgment was based on the former . To familiarize the subjects with the procedure and pace of the task , they were trained with another set of similar materials in the same procedure ( but without the post - scan questionnaire ) before the formal experiment . fMRI data acquisition : All scanning was performed on a 3 . 0T MRI Scanner ( GE 3T Signa ) equipped with EPI capability . Eighteen axial slices ( 5 . 3 mm thick , interleaved ) were prescribed to cover the whole brain . A T2 * - weighted gradient echo EPI was employed . The imaging parameters were TR ¼ 2s , TE ¼ 30 ms , FA ¼ 70 1 , FOV ¼ 20 (cid:2) 20cm ( 64 (cid:2) 64 mesh ) . To avoid head movement , participants wore a neck brace and were asked not to talk or move during scanning . Motion correction was also performed in a standard realign process in SPM99 . fMRI data analysis : The imaging data of the 13 subjects were analyzed by SPM99 . The data of each subject were individually pre - processed ( timeslice adjusted , realigned , normalized and smoothed ) . The spatially pre - processed data were then estimated to establish a random - effects model . Six event types were defined as presentation of ( 1 ) incomprehensible ambiguous sentences ; ( 2 ) comprehensible ambiguous sentences ; presentation of solution cues that were defined as ( 3 ) Aha events ( see above ) ; ( 4 ) non - Aha events ; ( 5 ) difficult solution events ; and ( 6 ) not under - standable events . Ambiguous sentence presentation events ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were modeled with a boxcar convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) . The period of the boxcar coincided with the duration of the sentence presentation phase . Solution cue presentation events ( 3 – 6 ) were modeled with the canonical HRF time - locked to the onset of solution cue presentation . We did not consider the results of difficult solution or not under - standable events , because there were insufficient trials ( o 10 ) . Both Aha and non - Aha events comprised 4 10 trials in each subject and the number of trials in these two events were comparable ( mean number of trials for Aha event was 2 014 Vol 15 No 13 15 September 2004 N EURO R EPORT J . LUO , K . NIKI AND S . PHILLIPS Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins . Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited . 16 . 67 ( SD ¼ 3 . 80 ) and for non - Aha event 14 . 50 ( SD ¼ 3 . 18 ) ) . The relatively low numbers of trials in each event were sufficient to detect the neural correlates of Aha ! reaction , because the effect was strong at individual and in group - level analyses . The threshold was set at p o 0 . 001 ( uncor - rected ) and Z 10 contiguous voxels . Locations reported by SPM99 were converted into Talairach coordinates [ 10 ] by the transform specified in the mni2tal . m program [ 11 ] . These coordinates were used to determine the nearest gray matter ( region and corresponding Brodmann area ) using the Talairach Daemon program version 1 . 1 [ 12 ] with the maximum range of 11 mm . RESULTS The mean reaction time for Aha events was 1 . 87 ( SD ¼ 0 . 52 ) s and for non - Aha events was 1 . 09 ( SD ¼ 0 . 17 ) s ( t ( 11 ) ¼ 5 . 98 , p o 0 . 001 ) . One subject’s reaction time was not available due to a recording failure . For 75 . 7 ( SD ¼ 0 . 15 ) % of the Aha trials , subjects thought the sentence and its solution cue fitted very well . For 72 . 9 ( SD ¼ 0 . 26 ) % of the Aha trials , subjects attributed their failure in the initial stage of sentence presentation to having thought about it in another direction . Relative to the Non - Aha event , the Aha event was associated with activities in ACC , left lateral PFC , and other areas ( Table 1 ; Fig . 1 ) . We also examined the effect of solution difficulty ( as indicated by time - on - task ) , contrasting the Aha event with the difficult solution event , which subjects evaluated as understandable , but fairly hard . The image data of the six subjects who provided sufficient difficult solution trials ( 4 10 ) were analyzed . The mean reaction time for difficult solution trials of 2 . 68s was significantly longer than that for Aha event trials ( 2 . 14 s ; t ( 5 ) ¼ 3 . 82 , p o 0 . 05 ) . Conjunction Table1 .

However , relative to the Aha event , the difficult solution showed activation in only left lateral PFC ( BA47 ; (cid:3) 34 , 27 , (cid:3) 13 ; T ¼ 3 . 92 ; K E : 124 ) but not in ACC . This result implied that left lateral PFC was sensitive to task difficulty whereas ACC was not . In summary , two major areas , ACC and left lateral PFC , were associated with the Aha ! reaction . In the ACC , activation was significantly greater for difficult solutions and Aha events than for non - Aha events , but activation for Aha events and difficult solutions did not significantly differ . In contrast , in left lateral PFC , activation was lowest for non - Aha events , significantly higher for Aha events , and greater still for difficult solution events . DISCUSSION We have identified the neural correlates of the Aha ! reaction , which included activity in ACC , lateral PFC , and several additional brain areas . For the majority of Aha trials ( 72 . 9 % ) , subjects attributed their initial failure to having thought about it in another direction . This implies that the Aha ! reaction involves breaking mental impasse . That is , upon seeing the solution cue subjects discarded their previous assumptions and changed their mental perspective in a way that led to a solution . The contribution of ACC to breaking mental impasse was related to conflict detection . Recent studies have suggested that ACC implements an early warning system [ 4 , 14 , 15 ] and is engaged when top - down control fails to block automatic processing of task - irrelevant information [ 14 ] . For example , in the Stroop task , Carter et al . [ 15 ] observed ACC activity when strategic processes were less engaged and conflict was high , but not when strategic processes were more engaged and conflict reduced . Similarly , in breaking of mental impasse , the strategic processes may also fail to block the activation of task - irrelevant automatic processes because inappropriate chunks were decomposed into component features during this process [ 16 ] , therefore , ACC participa - tion was required . In contrast to recent theories that associate ACC with response - related processing [ 17 , 18 ] , our results suggest that ACC may function more generally as the mechanism for conflict detection between different ways of thinking [ 19 , 20 ] . The function of left lateral PFC in breaking mental impasse may be related to conflict resolution . This area is known to mediate active comparison of stimuli held in working memory . In the context of the Aha ! reaction , one possible function of left lateral PFC is semantic selection . Here , selection refers to choosing suitable alternative meanings of the critical concept . This function is consistent with Thompson - Schill et al . ’s hypothesis that left lateral PFC mediated semantic selections among competing alternatives [ 8 ] . Another possibility is that left lateral PFC holds cognitive goals in working memory and allocates attention to the appropriate processing systems to meet those goals . This possibility is consistent with studies that showed left lateral PFC is responsible for establishing and switching between attentional sets [ 17 , 21 ] . Accordingly , left lateral PFC might subserve verification , where the key interpretation is applied to the entire context of the sentence . However , the contrast between Aha and difficult solution showed that only left lateral PFC , but not ACC , indexed the solution difficulty and time - on - task . The overall pattern of activity in lateral PFC and ACC was consistent with the role of conflict resolution for lateral PFC and conflict detection for ACC . The critical difference between difficult solution and Aha event lies in the demands imposed on conflict resolution processes . Once conflict is detected , difficult solution events require more time to resolve the conflict . The brain areas involved in the Aha ! reaction were different from those typically observed in semantic integra - tion . fMRI studies showed semantic integration activated bilateral lateral frontal and anterior temporal cortex , left posterior fusiform gyrus , and bilateral precentral gyrus [ 22 ] ; whereas ‘‘the Aha ! reaction’’ activated ACC and left lateral PFC . In our parallel ERP experiment , subjects did the same cognitive task while the EEG was recorded [ 20 ] . We observed that the Aha event elicited a more negative ERP deflection than non - Aha events in the time window 250 – 500 ms . Mean latency of the difference wave was around 380 ms ( N380 ) and dipole source analysis suggested the generator of N380 was around ACC . Given that it took about 2000ms for an Aha ! reaction event to be completed , it suggests that the N380 wave marks the beginning of competition between the old and new ways of thinking . Although the latency of N380 is close to the N400 wave linked to semantic integration , there are several differences : ( a ) The peak amplitude of N380 was at Cz , whereas N400 was located at centroparietal sites . ( b ) N400 usually had greater amplitude and duration over the right hemisphere , whereas there was no hemisphere difference for N380 . ( c ) The generator of N380 was located in ACC . The brain areas involved in the Aha ! reaction also differed from those observed in cognitive set shifting in the WCST . WCST studies showed only left lateral PFC but not ACC in the negative vs positive feedback contrast that signaled the need for a mental shift to a new response set [ 9 ] . In WCST , the decision criterion is repeatedly changed among two or three stimulus dimensions , which allows subjects to estab - lish some task - general strategy . A task - general strategy permits successful top - down intentional control , and so ACC is not required . Consistent with this view , we found that activation of ACC , but not left lateral PFC decreased as subjects became familiar with the cognitive task . We examined the involvement of ACC and left lateral PFC across the first , second and third blocks of the experimental session . The ratios of Aha events were comparable in the three blocks . Random effect analysis ( thresholded at p o 0 . 001 , uncorrected ) of 13 subjects showed that , relative to the resting state , all three blocks were associated with robust ACC and left lateral PFC activity ; however , only the activation in ACC significantly decreased from the first block to the second and third ones . This result is consistent with Milham et al . ’s observation that practice - related decreases in ACC activity were more rapid and more pronounced than those in the lateral PFC [ 14 ] . CONCLUSION The Aha ! reaction was associated with activity in ACC and left lateral PFC , suggesting that these two areas may 2 016 Vol 15 No 13 15 September 2004 N EURO R EPORT J . LUO , K .
