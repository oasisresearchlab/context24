Examining the Values Reflected by Children during AI Problem Formulation UTKARSH DWIVEDI , SALMA ELSAYED - ALI , ELIZABETH BONSIGNORE & HERNISA KACORRI , University of Maryland , College Park , USA Understanding how children design and what they value in AI interfaces that allow them to explicitly train their models such as teachable machines , could help increase such activities’ impact and guide the design of future technologies . In a co - design session using a modified storyboard , a team of 5 children ( aged 7 - 13 years ) and adult co - designers , engaged in AI problem formulation activities where they imagine their own teachable machines . Our findings , leveraging an established psychological value framework ( the Rokeach Value Survey ) , illuminate how children conceptualize and embed their values in AI systems that they themselves devise to support their everyday activities . Specifically , we find that children’s proposed ideas require advanced system intelligence , e . g . emotion detection and understanding the social relationships of a user . The underlying models could be trained under multiple modalities and any errors would be fixed by adding more data or by anticipating negative examples . Children’s ideas showed they cared about family and expected machines to understand their social context before making decisions .

XXXXXXX 1 INTRODUCTION Gaining insight into children’s values is a longstanding challenge in Child - Computer Interaction ( CCI ) [ 4 , 6 , 14 , 15 , 23 , 25 , 26 ] . Aligned with these efforts , in this work we involve children as active participants in designing future technology to reveal how they conceptualize and embed their values in a variety of AI system that they envision will support their everyday lives . The technology children are called to design is a teachable machine 1 , where “ the user is a willing participant in the adaptation process and actively provides feedback to the machine to guide its learning ” [ 21 ] . Teachable machines are playing an essential role in designing activities that can spark curiosity and promote children’s understanding of how AI works , its limitations , how bias creeps in , and its potential implications for our society [ 5 , 13 , 28 ] . To elicit children’s interests and values we don’t ask them to tinker with the input or output of existing teachable machines e . g . , recognize objects [ 5 , 27 ] or respond to gestures [ 13 ] . Instead , we invite them to imagine their own . Specifically , we invite a university - based intergenerational design team of 5 children ( aged 8 - 13 years ) and 5 adults , who have previously engaged in typical black - box tinkering teachable machines activities ( e . g . , similar to Dwivedi et al . [ 5 ] and Vartiainen et al . [ 28 ] ) . As shown in Figure 1 , we employ a structured “Big Paper” technique [ 8 ] . Structured storyboards allow us to explore how children define the context ( i . e . everyday use cases ) as well as input and outputs for their personal AI - infused technologies . More so , they explicitly elicit children’s notions of potential system failures their machine might encounter , along with their proposed approach for error recovery . 1 A term first coined in 1978 [ 2 ] and more recently used by Google [ 17 ] .

Our co - design study comprises : a ) Modified Big Paper with a structured storyboard that b ) child - adult pairs use to frame and discuss their ideas and then c ) present their teachable machines while a researcher summarizes their input . We used the Rokeach Value Survey [ 22 ] , an established psychological value framework , as an analytical framework to examine the values reflected in children’s designs while triangulating data from 5 “Big Paper” storyboards , 2 hours of session recordings , and 2 sets of field notes . We contribute evidence that participatory machine learning approaches that engage children in AI problem formulation can offer designers and researchers a means for re - centering children in the design of AI - infused technologies and for gaining insights into children’s values in AI . Specifically , our exploratory study : ( i ) provides empirical results on how children ( 8 - 13 years old ) formulate the everyday issues their AI systems will address ; and ( ii ) provides an approach for inferring human values in participatory machine learning projects by using Rokeach’s value survey [ 22 ] as an analytical lens for interpreting the personal values in children’s designs . 2 RELATED WORK Here , we summarize two strands of related work that supported our efforts to co - design the everyday AI systems that children envisioned . 2 . 1 Problem Formulation via Participatory Machine Learning There is a recent push for participatory techniques in machine learning ( see Sloane et al . [ 24 ] for a detailed review ) . The term ‘participatory machine learning’ is often used when participatory techniques are included in the problem formulation phase ( e . g . , [ 10 , 18 ] ) . Martin et al . [ 18 ] state that problem formulation , the focus of our co - design work , is a vital step in any machine learning application . They define it as “a step that involves determining the strategic goals driving the interventions and translating those strategic goals into tractable machine learning problems . ” Practical guidelines have emerged to help developers formulate their problems in machine learning [ 1 , 11 ] . However , these guidelines typically do not mention or recommend stakeholder involvement . Most prior work refers to adults as stakeholders ; very few studies have engaged children in problem formulation via participatory machine learning ( e . g . [ 3 , 28 , 31 ] ) . 2 . 2 Children’s Values in Design Technology is inherently value - laden [ 7 , 14 , 26 , 29 ] and computing research on values has largely focused on values of ethical import [ 9 , 19 ] such as privacy and security . Few of these studies focus on personal values and they largely emphasize the values of adults and researchers rather than children [ 16 , 23 , 26 , 32 ] . Skovbjerg et al . [ 23 ] recommend that Child - Computer Interaction ( CCI ) researchers acknowledge and discuss the embedded values in systems from the outset . In case of AI , important initial design implications can emerge in the problem formulation phase , raising 2 Examining the Values Reflected by Children during AI Problem Formulation CHI ’23 CCAI Workshop , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany profoundly different ethical concerns , such as possible threats to fairness and civil rights [ 20 ] . Thus , it is critical to examine and explicitly foreground children’s personal values in the design of AI - infused technology , and technology more broadly [ 4 , 6 , 23 , 25 , 32 ] . Social psychologist Milton Rokeach defines values as enduring beliefs and personal standards that guide and determine actions , attitudes , ideologies , judgments , justifications , and presentations of self [ 22 ] . In his established value survey ( RVS ) , he identified 36 values : 18 instrumental reflecting preferred behaviors and 18 terminal reflecting preferred end - states of existence [ 6 , 14 , 22 , 30 ] . We use these as an analytical tool to examine the perceived values reflected in children’s designs . 3 INSIGHTS We developed an understanding of the instrumental and terminal values in Rokeach’s framework [ 22 ] from past work by He et al . [ 12 ] who used the RVS to classify persuasive energy feedback technologies . Similarly , we sought to employ the RVS as an instrument for analyzing children’s values . Using Rokeach’s 36 values and their definitions , two coders found patterns in the data from 5 “Big Paper” storyboards , 2 hours of session recordings , and 2 sets of field notes . They individually coded the data , discussed classifications , resolved disagreements , and reached consensus . 3 . 1 Instrumental Values in Children’s Designs Rokeach describes instrumental values as preferred modes of behavior . For example , the value of “capability” entails competency and efficiency . Of the 18 instrumental values , we observed 5 in children’s designs of their everyday AI systems . All of the children’s designs appealed to the following instrumental values : “capability , ” “logic , ” “helpfulness , ” and “responsibility . ” Children described how their teachable machines would assist them in accomplishing a specific task , often explicitly using the word “help” to describe their machines . For example , Penny ( a pseudonym ) stated , “My machine is a wearable sensor , like a bracelet , and it’s a bracelet for cheerleaders to help them stay safe . ” Not only would Penny’s safety bracelet ensure the welfare of the wearer , but also anyone within a close distance to the wearer . She continued , “it tells people to get off the mat because it measures the people who are on the mat first and it alerts them to get off the mat to back up , and it measures if someone is still on or not . ” 3 . 2 Terminal Values in Children’s Designs Rokeach describes terminal values as preferred end - states . For example , the value of “family security” would entail taking care of loved ones . Of the 18 values , we observed 4 that were present in children’s designs . We classify children’s designs as appealing to the following terminal values : “family security , ” “a comfortable life , ” “inner harmony , ” and “an exciting life . ” For example , Alan’s teachable machine reflected Rokeach’s value “inner harmony , ” which means to have freedom from inner conflict . Alan designed an emotion detection machine in order to identify and alleviate times when someone may be experiencing negative emotions like sadness or anger , as well as detect and reward times when someone is happy or excited . 4 CONCLUSION Our exploratory co - design session offers insights into the everyday issues children imagine that AI systems can support ( i . e . , children’s AI problem formulation ) . Moreover , we provide an approach for inferring human values in participatory machine learning projects by using Rokeach’s value survey [ 22 ] as an analytical lens for interpreting the personal values in children’s designs . We hope to engage other workshop participants in future collaborations that may benefit from these insights , or provide constructive critiques of their potential utility in child - centered AI system design . 3 CHI ’23 CCAI Workshop , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Dwivedi et al .
