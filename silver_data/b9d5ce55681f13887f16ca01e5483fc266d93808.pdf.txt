Fe 2 1 is a cofactor for E . histolytica alcohol dehydro - genase 2 ( EhADH2 ) , an essential bifunctional enzyme [ alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH ) and aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) ] in the glycolytic pathway of E . histolytica . Methods : We tested the effects of iron depletion on trophozoite growth , the kinetics of iron binding to EhADH2 , and the activities of ADH and ALDH . Results : Growth of E . histolytica trophozoites , and ADH and ALDH enzymatic activities were directly inhibited by iron chelation . Kinetics of iron binding to EhADH2 reveals the differential iron afﬁnity of ADH ( higher ) and ALDH ( lower ) . Conclusions : This study demonstrates that iron chelation interrupts the completion of the fermentative pathway of E . histolytica by removing the metal cofactor indispensable for the structural and functional stability of EhADH2 , thus affecting trophozoite survival . We propose that iron - starvation - based strategies could be used to treat amoebiasis . Keywords : AdhE , enzyme inhibition , E . histolytica Introduction Entamoeba histolytica infects 50 million people yearly causing 100000 fatalities worldwide . 1 E . histolytica’ s cysts are ingested in contaminated food or water ; trophozoites colonize the host’s large intestine causing disentery . 2 Amoebiasis is treated with metronidazole ; however , its usefulness is limited by high toxicity , 2 which prompts the search for alternative drugs . E . histolytica lacks mitochondria and obtains energy by fer - menting glucose . The last stages of this pathway convert acetyl - CoA into ethanol by the enzymatic activities of aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) and alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH ) . 3 These functions are fused in E . histolytica alcohol dehydro - genase 2 ( EhADH2 ) , which is essential for the survival of E . histolytica . 3 AdhE , a homologous Escherichia coli enzyme , is required for bacterial fermentative growth . Episomal expression of ehadh2 gene in E . coli complements an adhE knock - out mutation , providing a system for inhibitor identiﬁcation . 3 , 4 Site - directed mutagenesis of conserved histidines at the iron - binding domain of EhADH2 inactivates ADH and ALDH , thus rendering the mutant proteins unable to rescue anaerobic growth of E . coli SHH31 ( D adhE ) . 3 Although our previous analyses suggest that iron is important for amoebic growth and enzymatic activities , 3 the physiological role of iron in amoebic growth or EhADH2 function had not been elucidated . Studies have empha - sized the importance of iron in pathogenic diseases and suggested iron chelation as chemotherapy , based on mammalian immune responses that sequester iron as the ﬁrst line of defense . 5 This study shows that iron affects ADH and ALDH enzymatic activi - ties and trophozoite survival . We propose that iron starvation could be further explored as treatment for amoebiasis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . * Corresponding author .

Metal / chelation effects on E . histolytica’s trophozoite growth Amoebic trophozoites ( 5 (cid:2) 10 3 ) were grown for 48 , 72 and 96 h in TYI - S - 33 alone or with 30 m M ferrous sulphate , 50 m M zinc sulphate , 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenanthroline or a combination of 30 m M ferrous sulphate þ 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenanthroline . To measure the reversal of the chelators’ inhibitory effect on growth of E . histolytica , amoebic tro - phozoites were grown with 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenanthroline for 7 h , then exposed to 30 m M ferrous sulphate , 30 m M ferrous sulphate þ 30 m M zinc sulphate þ 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenanthroline or 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenan - throline , or left in TYI medium alone ( control ) for 7 , 24 and 40 h , and counted . Assessment of EhADH2 ADH and ALDH activities Bacterial cells were processed as described elsewhere . 3 , 4 Bacterial lysates were used to measure NAD þ - dependent ALDH and ADH activities . ALDH activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm , following the oxi - dation of NADH to NAD using acetyl - CoA as a substrate . 3 , 4 ADH activity was measured similarly , by substituting acetaldehyde for acetyl - CoA as a substrate . 3 , 4 One unit of enzyme activity is deﬁned as that which consumed 1 mmol of NADH or NAD þ / min . Activity values were averaged from three independent experiments . All samples were conﬁrmed by SDS – PAGE and western blot analyses . 3 Effect of metal cofactors on EhADH2 catalytic activity Fe 2 þ content of bacterial lysates was determined colorimetrically using 1 , 10 - phenanthroline as an indicator with an extinction coefﬁ - cient of 31 . 5 mM / cm at 510 nm . 6 EhADH2 was added to an excess of 1 . 5 mM ( 3 - fold ) 1 , 10 - phenanthroline in 100 mM Trizma , pH 7 . 5 . The 1 , 10 - phenanthroline Fe 2 þ complexes were removed by dialysis Table 1 .

Espinosa et al . 676 against 20 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 . ADH and ALDH activities were measured with no ferrous sulphate , 30 m M ferrous sulphate , 50 m M zinc sulphate , 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenanthroline or a combination of 30 m M ferrous sulphate þ 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenanthroline . All assays were repeated in triplicate . Fe 2 þ afﬁnity and maximum rate As iron is not strictly a substrate , we use the term ‘binding afﬁnity constant’ instead of K m . It is inferred that a lower binding afﬁnity con - stant suggests stronger afﬁnity for iron . The apparent Michaelis – Menten constant for iron binding and the maximum rate of reaction were determined as follows : Fe 2 þ was removed from partially puriﬁed EhADH2 . 6 The concentration of Fe 2 þ present in the standard activity assay buffer was varied between 10 and 500 m M , and the initial rate of reaction was measured . Constant values were calculated . Results Iron effects on EhADH2 expression and enzymatic activities ADH and ALDH activities were enhanced by iron and inhibited by zinc or phenanthroline ( Table 1 ) . Iron in combination with phenanthroline or zinc ‘rescued’ enzymatic activities to levels similar to ones with iron alone ( Table 1 ) . SDS – PAGE showed that the effect of iron was not due to altered EhADH2 expression levels ( data not shown ) . The afﬁnity of EhADH2 for iron þ acetaldehyde ( lower binding constant ¼ 3 . 05 m M ) was 8 . 5 times stronger than for iron þ acetyl - CoA ( 25 . 9 m M ) ( Figure 1 ) . V max values were calculated as the maximum rate obtainable by Fe 2 þ saturation in the presence of 0 . 2 mM acetyl - CoA or 0 . 5 mM acetaldehyde and 0 . 2 mM NADH ( data not shown ) . Physiological effect of iron on E . histolytica trophozoite growth As shown in Figure 2 ( a ) , zinc and phenanthroline reduced tro - phozoite growth 1 . 5 - fold compared with medium alone , whereas iron enhanced trophozoite growth 2 . 5 - fold . Iron counteracted the inhibitory effects of phenanthroline and zinc when added together ( Figure 2a ) . Iron starvation by phenanthroline was reversed by iron even after several hours of growth in the pre - sence of chelator ( Figure 2b ) . Initially , the effects of iron star - vation on E . coli pEhADH2 growth were tested . Iron chelation inhibited the EhADH2 - expressing E . coli ; supplemental iron was able to reverse phenanthroline / zinc inhibition ( data not shown ) . Discussion Our study shows that EhADH2 requires Fe 2 þ and is inhibited by phenanthroline / zinc ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) . Zinc , although a diva - lent cation , is unable to substitute for Fe 2 þ . EhADH2 activities can be ‘rescued’ in the presence of chelator by adding saturating Fe 2 þ . The increase in catalytic activity in the Fe 2 þ – chelator com - bination ( Table 1 ) can be explained by this saturation . Fe 2 þ forms a complex with phenanthroline in a ratio of 1 : 3 . When 30 m M Fe 2 þ and 30 m M phenanthroline were added , 20 m M Fe 2 þ remained in solution , increasing both activities . The apparent Michaelis – Menten constant for iron binding in the presence of acetaldehyde and acetyl - CoA is seen in Figure 1 . A lower apparent Michaelis – Menten constant for iron ( 3 . 1 m M ) with acetaldehyde conﬁrms the importance of Fe 2 þ in E . histolytica ’s conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol . However , we also detected an apparent Michaelis – Menten constant for iron in the presence of acetyl - CoA ( 26 m M ) , which suggests that the ALDH activity requires an intact N - terminus and C - terminus ( Table 1 , Figure 1 and site - directed mutagenesis 3 ) . A recent study showed that E . coli SHH31 , trans - formed with the N - terminal ALDH domain , retains 30 % of ALDH enzymatic activity compared with the wild - type EhADH2 . 7 Based on our ﬁndings , we conclude that EhADH2 could have diverged structurally / functionally from the ancestral enzyme , as ADH and ALDH depend on iron binding for activity . Alternatively , an additional iron - binding site ( and more than one iron ) could be involved in the reaction as the K m for NADH is similar for acetaldehyde and acetyl - CoA . 3 Iron increased E . histolytica trophozoite growth ( Figure 2a ) . Growth inhibition of amoebic trophozoites by phenanthroline / zinc was countered by supplementary iron ( Figure 2a ) .

An initial 5 (cid:2) 10 3 HM1 : 1MSS E . histolytica trophozoites were inoculated per tube with TYI medium alone ( ﬁlled triangles ) , 30 m M ferrous sulphate ( ﬁlled circles ) , 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( ﬁlled diamonds ) , 50 m M zinc sulphate ( asterisks ) or 30 m M ferrous sulphate þ 50 m M zinc sulphate þ 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( ﬁlled squares ) , and counted at 48 , 72 and 96 h .

An initial 5 (cid:2) 10 3 HM1 : 1MSS E . histolytica trophozoites were inoculated per tube of TYI medium with 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenanthroline for 7 h . After this initial exposure to the chelator , trophozoites were exposed to 30 m M ferrous sulphate ( ﬁlled circles ) , 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( ﬁlled diamonds ) or 30 m M ferrous sulphate þ 50 m M zinc sulphate þ 30 m M 1 , 10 - phenanthroline ( ﬁlled squares ) , or left in TYI medium alone ( ﬁlled triangles ) , and counted at 7 , 24 and 40 h . The time when second additions were supplemented ( after the 7 h ) is indicated by an arrow . Iron depletion as potential treatment for amoebiasis 677 iron - containing superoxide dismutase ( Fe 2 þ SOD ) is probably the main enzyme for detoxiﬁcation of reactive oxygen intermedi - ates , 2 scavenging iron might change EhADH2 conformation and delay / prevent oxygen inactivation ( Figure 2b ) . We delayed ADH / ALDH oxygen damage by lysing the cells with phenanthroline , thus restoring activity by adding iron prior to the assay ( data not shown ) . E . coli ’s AdhE is inactivated by hydrogen peroxide due to a metal - catalysed oxidation reaction . 8 AdhE seems to act as an H 2 O 2 scavenger in E . coli cells delaying death . 8 Inactivation of iron transcriptional regulator RitR in Streptococcus pneumoniae decreases expression levels of adhE mRNA and increases sus - ceptibility to hydrogen peroxide during exponential growth . 9 The role of AdhE homologues might be to prevent DNA damage and protect pathogens from oxidative stress . Our work implies that sequestering iron for the activities of EhADH2 ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) could be used to control amoebic infection . Previous studies have shown associations between amoebic infection and iron levels in humans : milk - drinking Maasai have less amoebic infections than consumers of a mixed diet ( milk and blood ) , suggesting that low - iron - content foods could provide some resistance to amoebiasis . 10 Higher incidence of amoebic liver abscess in alcoholic patients has been correlated with increased hepatic iron content . 11 Interestingly , immune responses to pathogens in mammals rely on iron sequestration . 5 Recent studies have linked the iron scavenging role of lactoferrin / lactoferricin to trophozoite death in vitro , 12 implying that controlled iron depletion could be used to kill amoeba . Researchers have speculated that the antiamoebic effectiveness of iodo - hydroxyquinolines relies on its iron - binding properties . 13 Our results demonstrate that iron chelation interrupts the completion of the fermentative pathway of E . histolytica by removing the metal cofactor indispensable for the structural and functional stability of EhADH2 . In vivo mammal experimentation shall be pursued to establish the appropriate use of iron chelation against amoebiasis . Acknowledgements We thank Shannon Arnold for technical assistance .
