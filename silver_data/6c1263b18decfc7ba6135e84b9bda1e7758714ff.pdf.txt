STEM Many students across the USA fail to meet proficiency standards in STEM domains ( National Science Foundation 2014 ) . One potential source of failure is students ’ misconceptions or limited conceptual understanding of critical STEM concepts ( Eryilmaz 2002 ) . As a result , learning in STEM not only requires the acquisition of new knowledge but also the revision of previously acquired incorrect knowledge ( or misconceptions ) , what has been termed as knowledge revision ( Kendeou and O ’ Brien 2014 ) . In order to develop effective interventions designed to promote knowledge revision in STEM , it is critical to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the knowledge revision process . In the present paper , we focus on fundamental knowledge revision processes and their relation to students ’ relational reasoning ( i . e . , reasoning with analogy , anomaly , antinomy , and antithesis ) . Our goal is to draw a Educ Psychol Rev ( 2017 ) 29 : 27 – 39 DOI 10 . 1007 / s10648 - 016 - 9381 - 3 * Panayiota Kendeou kend0040 @ umn . edu 1 Department of Educational Psychology , University of Minnesota , 56 East River Road , Minneapolis , MN 55455 , USA 2 University of New Hampshire , Durham , NH , USA connection between knowledge revision and relational reasoning , theoretically and empirically .

Conceptual Change Throughout this paper and in our work , we have opted for the use of the term knowledge revision as opposed to conceptual change to refer to the revision or change of misconceptions . The choice is intentional and provides theoretical value that we would like to explain . First , the use of the term knowledge revision directly addresses the challenge of specific assumptions regarding the structure and nature of prior knowledge . In our theoretical framework ( Kendeou and O ’ Brien 2014 ) , we make no specific assumptions regarding grain size ( i . e . , the level at which the knowledge is misconceived ; Chi 2013 ) or coherence ( i . e . , whether misconceptions are organized in B coherent ^ theories ( Vosniadou 1994 ) or B fragmented pieces ^ ( DiSessa 1993 ) of the pre - existing knowledge representation . This is in contrast to research in conceptual change where knowledge representation and the role of concepts is a fundamental aspect of existing models and theories . Independent of the unit of analysis or grain size , we adopt the view that knowledge is represented in the form of interconnected networks of information or semantic networks ( Anderson 1983 ; Collins and Quillian 1969 ) . These networks represent knowledge as a system of interconnections between meaningful information units in memory . Second , the use of the term knowledge revision pertains to the operationalization of revision or change . We reject a knowledge revision process that assumes an B erase - and - replace ^ principle . Instead , we adopt the view that knowledge revision involves the acquisition of correct knowledge ; this , in turn , produces a gradual and incremental reduction and / or elimi - nation of the activation of pre - existing misconceptions and , thus , interference , of pre - existing misconceptions . This is in contrast to research in conceptual change where knowledge transformation or restructuring is a fundamental aspect of existing models and theories . Our view is consistent with recent evidence suggesting the coexistence of multiple conceptions ( instead of the transformation of misconceptions ) in individuals ’ memory ( Dunbar et al . 2007 ; Masson et al . 2014 ; Nelson et al . 2007 ; Potvin et al . 2015 ; Potvin et al . 2014 ) . Knowledge Revision During Reading : the KReC Framework The KReC framework ( Kendeou and O ’ Brien 2014 ) outlines five principles , two of which are assumptions and three are necessary conditions , for the knowledge revision process to be successful : encoding , passive activation , co - activation , integration , and competing activation . The first assumption is the encoding principle , which states that once information has been encoded into long - term memory , it cannot be deleted . As a result , such information has the potential to be reactivated at any point during the 28 Educ Psychol Rev ( 2017 ) 29 : 27 – 39 learning process and influence subsequent learning and memory . The second assump - tion is the passive activation principle . According to the second assumption , informa - tion in long - term memory can be reactivated through a passive activation process derived from global models of memory ( Gillund and Shiffrin 1984 ; Ratcliff and McKoon 1988 ) . Because this process is both passive and unrestricted , any information that is related to the current contents of working memory has the potential to become activated , independent of whether it facilitates or interferes with learning and / or comprehension . These two assumptions raise an important question : If information that has been previously acquired , but is incorrect , cannot be deleted or replaced , and always has the potential to be reactivated and influence subsequent learning , how can we facilitate its correction or revision ? The answer is by creating learning conditions that have the potential to reduce or even eliminate the reactivation of such incorrect information , while at the same time facilitate the encoding and activation of the correct information . In the context of KReC , reducing or eliminating the impact of incorrect information is accomplished in the presence of three conditions , as exemplified by the co - activation , inte - gration , and competing activation principles . The co - activation of correct and incorrect information is a necessary condition for knowledge revision because it is the only way that new information can come in contact with , and be integrated with , previously acquired incorrect information ( Kendeou et al . 2011 ; Kendeou and van den Broek 2007 ; van den Broek and Kendeou 2008 ) . According to the integration principle , knowledge revision can only occur when new information is integrated with previously acquired incorrect information . Any time new information is integrated with previously acquired information , the long - term memory representation of that information is revised to take into account the new information ( e . g . , Kendeou et al . 2013 ; Kendeou et al . 2014 ; O ’ Brien et al . 2010 ; O ’ Brien et al . 2004 ; O ’ Brien et al . 1998 ) . The fate of the knowledge revision process — whether the activation of the previously acquired incorrect information will be reduced or eliminated — is determined by the competing activation principle . Specifically , as the amount of new , correct information is increased , it begins to dominate the integrated network of information . As this occurs , the new information draws increasing amounts of activation to itself , while at the same time drawing activation away from the previously - acquired incorrect information . This is because we operate in a system of limited resources ; more activation drawn by one structure leaves less activation available to be drawn by another structure . Kendeou and O ’ Brien ( 2014 ) provided evidence for the revision mechanism outlined in KReC in a series of experiments using refutation texts . Refutation texts provide the reader with information that explicitly acknowledges commonly held incorrect conceptions or beliefs about a topic , directly refutes them , and provides a more satisfactory explanation ( Hynd 2001 ) . Kendeou and O ’ Brien argued that refutation texts enable the co - activation of the correct and the incorrect information , as well as their integration , because they explicitly state the misconception and directly refute it . Further , the correct information is supported by an elaborate , highly interconnected explanation that B wins over ^ the competition for reactivation and , thus , reduces or even eliminates the activation of the misconception . Indeed , Kendeou et al . ( 2013 ) demonstrated that a systematic increase of the interconnectedness of the expla - nation resulted in a systematic decrease of the activation of the incorrect information . Further , Kendeou et al . ( 2014 ) demonstrated that newly encoded information was the most effective at eliminating the activation and interference from incorrect information when it included causal explanations . This is because causal information inherently provides a rich set of Educ Psychol Rev ( 2017 ) 29 : 27 – 39 29 interconnections to prior knowledge ( O ’ Brien and Myers 1987 ; Trabasso and Suh 1993 ; Trabasso and van den Broek 1985 ) . It is important to note that the KReC framework is one account of knowledge revision . We acknowledge that there are multiple routes to revision or change ( Chinn and Samarapungavan 2009 ) , as reflected by the number of existing models and theories in the conceptual change literature ( e . g . , see Vosniadou 2008 , for an extensive review ) . What the KReC framework contributes to the existing literature is an explication of the fundamental underpinnings of knowledge revision as exemplified by its five principles and , thus , one mechanism of change that is driven by the basic processes of co - activation , integration , and competing activation between different information networks . It is also important to note that , even though the basic processes and mechanisms assumed in KReC are bottom - up , top - down processes also have the potential to exert an influence on revision . For example , specific instructions that direct a reader ’ s attention influence what information is activated and becomes available . Even though trying to define with any degree of precision the thin line that divides bottom - up from top - down processes in this context is a near to impossible task ( Kendeou and O ’ Brien 2016 ) , we propose that attention allocation is the gateway by which top - down or strategic processes can , and do , exert an influence on bottom - up or memory - based processes . One such top - down factor that has the potential to play an important role in knowledge revision is relational reasoning skills . We turn to this next . Relational Reasoning During Reading Relational reasoning is considered a higher - order skill that is relevant in reading comprehension and learning ( Alexander et al . 2016b ; Goldman and Pellegrino 2015 ) . As such , it also has the potential to play a critical role in knowledge revision during reading . Relational reasoning is defined as B cognitive procedures purposefully applied to recognizing or deriving meaningful relations or patterns between and amongst pieces of information that would otherwise appear unrelated , ^ ( Alexander and the Disciplined Reading and Learning Research Laboratory 2012 , p . 272 ) . Dumas et al . ( 2013 ) proposed that relational reasoning has important educational implications because it enables individuals to connect ( i . e . , integrate ) multiple sources of informa - tion into a coherent mental representation . Previous research on reasoning has typi - cally defined relational reasoning as a unitary construct ( Dumas et al . 2013 ; Jablansky et al . 2015 ) . However , Dumas et al . proposed a multidimensional approach to study - ing relational reasoning , identifying four distinct constructs or dimensions : analogy , anomaly , antinomy , and antithesis . Analogical reasoning involves identifying similar - ities across two different ideas , concepts , or events . Anomalous reasoning involves identifying ideas , concepts , or events that are unusual or unexpected . Antinomous reasoning involves identifying a rule that allows to describe what something is by identifying what it is not ( mutual exclusivity ) . Antithetical reasoning involves identi - fying and analyzing contrasting positions . In what follows , we discuss work that has incorporated these different manifestations of reasoning in texts in the service of knowledge revision . In doing so , we begin to draw direct links between reasoning and knowledge revision processes during reading comprehension . 30 Educ Psychol Rev ( 2017 ) 29 : 27 – 39 Analogical Reasoning An analogy is an explicit comparison between the structures of two domains — one of which is more familiar to the reader , and one of which is less unfamiliar to the reader . For example , B the atom is like our solar system ^ ( Gentner 1983 ) is an analogy that could be used to introduce the target concept B atom ^ by mapping similarities to the source or known concept B solar system . ^ Thus , analogical reasoning relies on readers ’ identification of structural similarities between seemingly disparate concepts , objects , or situations to communicate new information ( Dumas et al . 2013 ) . Because analogies present new information within the context of familiar prior knowledge , readers must engage in a process of comparison to identify what is structurally similar from what is structurally dissimilar in order to construct a new coherent understanding ( Duit 1991 ) . This process of comparison or structure - mapping ( Gentner 1983 ) is particularly helpful for readers with limited knowledge about the targeted to - be - learned information ( Donnelly and McDaniel 2000 ; Iding 1997 ) . Previous research investigating the effectiveness of analogies in texts has provided mixed findings . A number of studies have shown that analogies support comprehension ( e . g . , Donnelly and McDaniel 2000 ; Hayes and Tierney 1982 ; Vosniadou and Schommer 1988 ) , whereas others reported that analogies are not that effective ( e . g . , Alexander and Kulikowich 1991 ; Iding 1993 ) . Some researchers even argue that analogies actually foster misconceptions because readers may misapply ideas from the source domain ( i . e . , the domain of the analogy ) to the target domain ( i . e . , the domain of the target information ; Donnelly and McDaniel 2000 ; Duit 1991 ) . Additionally , analogies may lead readers to believe they have sufficiently comprehended the text and therefore not engage in effortful , deep processing ( Brown and Clement 1989 ) . Braasch and Goldman ( 2010 ) reported that knowledge of the analogy source domain itself had a positive impact on learning of the target domain ( consistent with structure - mapping theory ; Gentner 1983 ) . Specifically , readers with more source knowledge constructed more accurate conceptual understanding of the target information than readers with less source knowledge . Additionally , the knowledge representations created by readers with high source knowledge included fewer misconceptions than representations created by readers with less source knowledge . These findings suggested that the presence of a familiar analogy activated related prior knowledge that , in turn , was integrated with the target domain . Indeed , readers ’ self - explanation inferences suggested that this reactivated prior knowledge guided their un - derstanding and representation of the causal mechanisms within the target domain . Thus , analogies may only foster comprehension of target information when the reader has sufficient prior knowledge of the source domain ( Dennis and Sternberg 1999 ; Duit 1991 ; Gentner and Holyoak 1997 ; Holyoak and Thagard 1997 ; Iding 1997 ) . Because analogical reasoning relies on readers ’ identification of structural similarities between different information ( Dumas et al . 2013 ) and requires readers to engage in a process of comparison to identify what is structurally similar from what is dissimilar ( Gentner 1983 ) , it has the potential to facilitate knowledge revision when analogies are used in texts and / or reactivated from prior knowledge . Anomalous Reasoning An anomaly is an unexpected or abnormal occurrence that typically departs from an established pattern ( Schulz et al . 2008 ) . Thus , reasoning with anomaly involves the ability Educ Psychol Rev ( 2017 ) 29 : 27 – 39 31 to discern a pattern among a set of ideas , objects , or occurrences and perceive deviations from that pattern ( Alexander et al . 2016a , b ) . Much of the existing research in this area with texts has explored verbal semantic anomalies — short passages that contain anomalous information ( Dumas et al . 2013 ) . One classic example of verbal semantic anomaly is the Moses Illusion ( Erickson and Mattson 1981 ) . The Moses Illusion requires readers to answer the question B How many animals of each sort did Moses put on the Ark ? ^ Most responders say B Two ^ and make no note of the anomalous information ( i . e . , that it was Noah and not Moses who had the Ark ) . A comparable example from STEM could include a question B By flying a kite , what did Edison discover ? ^ Most responders say B electricity ^ and make no note of the anomalous information ( i . e . , that it was Franklin and not Edison who discovered electricity ) . Such responses suggest that readers engage in rather shallow processing of semantic information . For difficult anomalies , semantic information may simply go unutilized by the reader . In fact , readers ’ ability to detect such semantic anomalies depends on the extent to which the anomalous information fits the general context of the text . On the one hand , the more the anomaly fails to fit the context , the easier it is to detect ( Sanford et al . 2010 ) . On the other hand , when the contextual fit is good , readers are more likely to overlook anomalies ( Bohan and Sanford 2008 ) . Beyond verbal semantic anomalies , readers also encounter anomalous data in texts . Chinn and Brewer ( 1993 , 1998 ) provided an in - depth analysis of potential reader responses to anomalous data , only one of which is to revise one ’ s B theory ^ to account for the anomalous data . Specifically , readers may ignore the anomalous data , reject the data as fraudulent , exclude the data from the current context , hold the data in abeyance , feel uncertainty about believing the data , reinterpret the data without changing their initial position , reinterpret the data while making peripheral changes to their initial position , or accept the data and change their initial position to accommodate them . Further , Chinn and Brewer suggested that characteristics of both the reader and the anomalous data influence the readers ’ response . With respect to reader characteristics , the strength of the pre - existing knowledge , as well as epistemological com - mitments , are critical factors that influence revision . With respect to the characteristics of the anomalous data , readers respond better when the data are credible , clear , and provide multiple sources of support — all of these characteristics decrease the likelihood that readers will reinterpret data and therefore foster misconceptions . Finally , depth of processing also influ - ences how readers respond to anomalous data . Readers who engage in deep processing are more likely to undergo revision because deep processing fosters understanding of the anom - alous data and the readers ’ ability to explain the data . This is especially true when the anomalous data fosters personal involvement , as well as when readers know they will have to justify their reasoning in the future . Because reasoning with anomalous data has the potential to facilitate knowledge revision ( Chinn and Brewer 1993 , 1998 ) , it would be important to examine further the role of anomalous reasoning in the revision process . Specifically , it would be important to identify the conditions that will increase the probability of revision driven by anomalous reasoning . Antithetical Reasoning Antithesis is a direct oppositional relationship between two mental representations ( Kreezer and Dallenbach 1929 ) . Reasoning with antithesis plays a key role in argumentation and persuasion ( Kuhn and Udell 2007 ) , as well as conceptual change ( Chi et al . 2012 ) . For example , in persuasion research when readers are presented with an argument composed of 32 Educ Psychol Rev ( 2017 ) 29 : 27 – 39 two directly opposing sides , they are susceptible to B myside bias ^ ( Stanovich and West 2007 ; Wolfe and Britt 2008 ) , namely they pay attention , evaluate evidence , generate evidence , and test hypotheses that primarily support their own view . In conceptual change , antithetical relations are often situated in the context of refutation texts ( Hynd 2001 ) . Specifically , the explicit refutation of the misconception creates an antithesis between the misconception and the correct information that is subsequently introduced . Thus , antithetical reasoning is likely to play an important role in knowledge revision because antithetical relations are central in refutation texts ( Alexander et al . 2016a ; Dumas et al . 2013 ) . Because of the well - documented effectiveness of refutation texts in knowledge revision ( Ariasi and Mason 2011 , 2014 ; Broughton et al . 2010 ; Diakidoy et al . 2011 ; Kendeou and van den Broek 2007 ; McCrudden and Kendeou 2014 ; Trevors and Muis 2015 ; van den Broek and Kendeou 2008 ) , it would be important to examine further the role and specific contribution of antithetical reasoning in revision . Antinomous Reasoning Antinomous reasoning is the determination of rule - based criteria that allows a reader to understand a concept , idea , or an object by what it is not ( Alexander et al . 2016a , b ) . For example , identifying an item as B living ^ or B not living ^ involves antinomous reasoning . As Dumas et al . ( 2013 ) reported in their review , little is known about reasoning with antinomy . Tanca et al . ( 2010 ) investigated the strategies participants used when processing visual antinomies . They found that participants visually deconstructed figures into parts , critically considered them , and then reconstructed the parts into a new whole . Dumas et al . pointed out that this process is similar to the processes that experts use when resolving antinomies in their field . Indeed , scholars strive to resolve conceptual antinomies by broadly considering the antinomy , deconstructing it , then reconstructing the component parts into a reasoned argument that explains or circumvents the initial paradox ( Cole and Wertsch 1996 ; Mosenthal 1988 ) . However , the current research regarding antinomous reasoning says little about how readers process antinomy in texts . Refutation texts may involve antinomous reasoning in cases in which a distinction is drawn between what something is versus what it is not . Thus , despite the lack of research on antinomous reasoning , we contend that it has the potential to play a role in knowledge revision when there is an antinomous connection between the correct and the incorrect information . Relational Reasoning in Knowledge Revision During Reading In the previous sections , we provided a brief review of what we know about knowledge revision and relational reasoning in the context of reading comprehension . On the one hand , knowledge revision processes in the context of the KReC framework have been described as memory - based or bottom - up in nature . On the other hand , relational reasoning has been described as a multidimensional construct that is top - down or strategic in nature . Our goal in this section is to integrate knowledge revision and relational reasoning by identifying how such reasoning fits in the KReC framework . In doing so , we need to specify how top - down , strategic processes exert an influence on bottom - up , memory - based processes . As we men - tioned earlier in this paper , the line that divides top - down from bottom - up processes during reading is rather thin and , therefore , trying to define it with any degree of precision is a near to Educ Psychol Rev ( 2017 ) 29 : 27 – 39 33 impossible task ( Kendeou and O ’ Brien 2016 ) . Despite this lack of precision in identifying at which point the reader shifts from bottom - up to top - down processes and vice versa , such shifts are likely driven by attention allocation . Thus , we propose that attention allocation is the gateway by which top - down processes exert an influence on bottom - up processes . Recall that there are three necessary conditions for knowledge revision in KReC : co - activation , integration , and competing activation . Each of these conditions has the potential to facilitate relational reasoning by drawing readers ’ attention to the nature of the relation between the correct and the incorrect idea , as well as influencing what other information gets activated and becomes available to the reader . In the initial stages of revision , co - activation enables the reader to detect the conflict or anomaly between prior knowledge ( misconception ) and the new information in the text ( Kendeou and van den Broek 2007 ; van den Broek 2010 ) . This co - activation also enables the integration of the correct and incorrect conceptions in a semantic network . The integration of these conceptions can draw readers ’ attention to identifying the nature of the relation between these conceptions , such as similarities ( i . e . , analogical reasoning ) , contrasts ( i . e . , antithetical reasoning ) , and / or distinctions ( i . e . , antinomous reasoning ) . Thus , during integra - tion , and depending on the relation between the correct and the incorrect conception , various facets of relational reasoning have the potential to be facilitated . At this stage , the reader may engage in goal - directed processing to identify similarities , differences , and / or compare and contrast the two conceptions — all in an effort to establish coherence ( van den Broek and Kendeou 2008 ) — coherence that has been disrupted by the co - activation of the two conflicting conceptions and the detection of the anomaly . Further , when readers confront a conflict or anomaly in a refutation text , it is the supporting explanation that facilitates knowledge revision , not the presence of the anomaly itself ( Kendeou et al . 2014 ) . In order for the correct information to B win out ^ and eliminate the activation of the misconception , the correct information must be supported by a rich , inter - connected network of causal information ( Kendeou et al . 2013 , 2014 ) . This interconnected explanation supports the correct information and highlights why the misconception is inaccu - rate ; that is , the explanation highlights the incompatibilities between the misconception and the correct information . This ensures that the correct information remains distinct in memory from the misconception , preventing its intrusion at later learning tasks ( Diakidoy et al . 2016 ) . From this perspective , relational reasoning can exert a top - down influence on the construction of this interconnected causal network that supports the correct conception and , thus , influence competing activation . For example , the reader may engage in goal - directed processing to identify similarities between the explanation supporting the correct conception and back - ground knowledge . These connections may strengthen the evidence supporting the correct conceptions and facilitate revision . However , the reader may also engage in goal - directed processing to identify evidence in background knowledge that supports the misconception instead , consistent with B myside bias ^ ( Stanovich et al . 2013 ) . These connections may strengthen the misconception further and hinder revision , a phenomenon known as the B backfire effect ^ ( Nyhan et al . 2013 ) . An additional way in which relational reasoning can influence knowledge revision is via text design . Specifically , recent research has explored enhancing the refutation texts with analogies . For example , Danielson et al . ( 2016 ) demonstrated that a refutation text enhanced with an analogy resulted in greater revision when compared to a refutation only condition . Danielson et al . posited that the analogy helped the readers build an even stronger network in support of the correct information than the one constructed during reading of the refutation text 34 Educ Psychol Rev ( 2017 ) 29 : 27 – 39 that did not include an analogy . As a result , the correct information was far more likely to B win out ^ the competition for reactivation in immediate and delayed post - testing situations . Thus , analogical reasoning can also be facilitated by text design , as the inclusion of an analogy in a refutation text allows for the activation and the integration of the prior source domain knowledge with the target domain knowledge . These initial attempts to explicitly connect aspects of relational reasoning and knowledge revision highlight the important role relational reasoning can play in learning more generally , and in STEM domains more specifically . Future research is needed , however , to better understand not only the respective relations but also the mechanisms by which these types of reasoning influence knowledge revision . We discuss future directions in this area next . Future Directions The initial evidence that supports the important role of relational reasoning in knowledge revision during reading raises a number of questions that warrant further investigation . One issue is the extent to which these processes are unique to reading comprehension or whether they generalize beyond text . One the one hand , the answer to this question is rather straight - forward for relational reasoning . Relational reasoning is viewed as a higher - order skill that individuals evoke in different situations and contexts . Thus , its generalization to contexts beyond text is not only expected , it is also well - documented ( Alexander et al . 2016a , b ) . On the other hand , the answer to this question for the knowledge revision processes outlined in KReC is not that straightforward and warrants further investigation . Although we have argued already that the actual processes by which revision is accomplished during reading is not specific to reading itself , the evidence in support of this claim stems from theoretical arguments , namely the fact that KReC evokes basic memory processes and mechanisms in the service of revision ( e . g . , co - activation , integration , competing activation ) . Thus , it is important to address this issue in future research . For example , the co - activation and integration of correct and incorrect information could be tested in the context of web - based learning environments , simulations , classroom - based activities , or actual experiments students perform . Further , shifting the B competition ^ towards the correct information and away from the incorrect information could also be tested if elaborate causal explanations are provided to the students by other means beyond text ; these would include , for example , aurally presented information , visual or graphical depictions , simulations , etc . The second issue of generalization pertains to B grain size ^ or the level at which the knowledge is misconceived . In this paper , we limited our discussion to revision for knowledge misconceived at the individual belief level . In this context , we follow Chi ’ s ( 2013 ) framework , which specifies four levels of misconceived knowledge : ( a ) false beliefs , ( b ) flawed mental models , ( c ) incorrect ontological categories , and ( d ) missing schema . A false belief is a single incorrect idea — often equated with incorrect factual information ; a mental model is an organized system of ideas or beliefs that are interrelated ; ontological categories are organiza - tional systems designed to categorize concepts ; schemas are also organizational systems . According to Chi , one way that false beliefs can be revised is via direct refutation . Indeed , the basic processes and mechanisms outlined in KReC lend themselves nicely for the revision of individual beliefs , as it has been demonstrated in several experiments ( Kendeou et al . 2013 , 2014 ) . It is unclear whether the framework can account for revision at other levels . With respect to revision at the mental model level , there is evidence that it can also be accomplished via refutation of several false beliefs , refutation of basic assumptions of the mental model , or Educ Psychol Rev ( 2017 ) 29 : 27 – 39 35 holistic refutation ( Chi 2013 ; Gadgil et al . 2012 ) . Thus , the processes in KReC have the potential to account for revision at the mental model level as well , but future research is needed to examine this possibility . For misconceived knowledge at the category or schema level , revision is far more difficult if not impossible via refutation alone . A third issue that warrants further investigation pertains to other individual differences that may moderate the role of relational reasoning in knowledge revision . Executive functions ( EF ) are among those individual differences that have been largely unexplored in STEM learning . EFs are general - purpose mechanisms that regulate cognition ; EFs involve at least three components : ( a ) inhibition of prepotent responses , ( b ) updating and monitoring representations in working memory , and ( c ) shifting between mental sets or tasks ( Miyake et al . 2000 ) . EFs are likely to play a moderating role in this process because individuals must continuously update the contents of working memory as they encode new information , shift between the co - activated , competing information , and inhibit the activation of misconceptions . Exploratory , on - going research suggests that EF may play a role when the text , by design , does not effectively refute and / or explain common misconceptions ( Butterfuss and Kendeou 2016 ) . Concluding Remarks Knowledge revision in STEM involves the same underlying mechanisms as knowl - edge acquisition but with the added burden to overcome previously - acquired infor - mation . The specific processes and mechanism of knowledge revision have been made more transparent in the context of KReC . These processes and mechanism are likely influenced by higher - order processes , such as relational reasoning and other individual differences that warrant further investigation . Given the emphasis of recent initiatives in education , such as the Common Core State Standards ( CCSS 2010 ) and the Next Generation Science Standards ( NGSS 2013 ) , on high - order thinking skills investigat - ing these issuess is particularly important .
