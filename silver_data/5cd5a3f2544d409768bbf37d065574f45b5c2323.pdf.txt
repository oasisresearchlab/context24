Nature also makes extensive use of pressurized elastic capsules : plant cells , bacteria and fungi have stiff walls , which are subject to an internal turgor pressure . Here , we present theoretical , numerical and experimental investigations of the indentation of a linearly elastic shell subject to a constant internal pressure . We show that , unlike unpres - surized shells , the relationship between force and displacement demonstrates two linear regimes . We determine analytical expressions for the effective stiffness in each of these regimes in terms of the material properties of the shell and the pressure difference . As a con - sequence , a single indentation experiment over a range of displacements may be used as a simple assay to determine both the internal pressure and elastic properties of capsules . Our results are relevant for determining the internal pressure in bacterial , fungal or plant cells . As an illustration of this , we apply our results to recent measurements of the stiffness of baker’s yeast and infer from these experiments that the internal osmotic pressure of yeast cells may be regulated in response to changes in the osmotic pressure of the external medium .

INTRODUCTION Just as one might ‘poke’ an object to have a qualitative sense of its material properties , materials scientists often use an indentation test to make quantitative measurements of an object’s elasticity [ 1 – 3 ] . Inden - tation is a useful technique because it is repeatable and non - destructive . For small scale applications in biology , it is common to use an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) in an indentation test to obtain high levels of accuracy that would not otherwise be possible [ 4 ] . While several studies have focused on determining the mechanical properties of both animal and plant cells using variants of the indentation test [ 5 , 6 ] , a question of particular interest for plant , fungal and bacterial cells is the turgor pressure within the cell . Indeed , differ - ences in turgor pressure could be important for the regulation of growth [ 7 ] . It has been suggested pre - viously [ 8 – 11 ] that indentation using an AFM would allow the turgor pressure of bacteria to be measured . However , this previous work relied on an ad hoc approach to the equations of elasticity rather than using classical shell theory . From a fundamental point of view , the indentation of unpressurized elastic shells has received a great deal of theoretical attention [ 12 – 15 ] . Much of the early work focused on axisymmetric geometries but more recently the simple problem of indentation has been used as a starting point in understanding some of the more com - plicated geometries that arise when an object with an intrinsic curvature is subject to different external loads [ 16 , 17 ] . By contrast , very little work has concerned the indentation of a pressurized elastic shell , despite its tech - nological importance in applications such as pressure vessels [ 18 ] or capsules designed for drug delivery [ 19 , 20 ] . However , numerical simulations have been car - ried out for the case of a thick , ﬂuid - ﬁlled shell with a constant volume [ 21 ] and for a thin shell ( or membrane ) subject to a constant internal pressure [ 20 ] . Here , we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the indentation of spherical pressurized shells , combin - ing an analytical study of the equations of shells with * Authors for correspondence ( dominic . vella @ maths . ox . ac . uk ; arezki . boudaoud @ ens - lyon . fr ) .

After the formulation of the problem of interest , we suc - cessively focus on the regimes of small and large indentations . We show that in each of these regimes the shell has a characteristic stiffness and determine analy - tical expressions for these stiffnesses in terms of the material properties of the system . Finally , we apply these results to previous microscopic experiments on the indentation of polymeric capsules [ 20 ] and of baker’s yeast [ 22 ] . In particular , our approach allows us to inves - tigate the regulation of the osmotic pressure of yeast cells . 2 . FIRST OBSERVATIONS AND FORMULATION Our model system is shown schematically in ﬁgure 1 a . We consider an elastic shell of natural radius R , thickness h , Young’s modulus E , Poisson ratio v that is subject to an internal pressure ( or pressure difference ) p . The shell is then deformed by the action of a point - like force , F . Numerical simulations were performed using the com - mercial ﬁnite - element package A BAQUS ( SIMULIA , Providence , RI , USA ) , a commercial ﬁnite - element pack - age , with material properties R ¼ 1 m , E ¼ 70 GPa and v ¼ 0 . 3 . ( Three - node thin quadratic axisymmetric shell elements were used in all calculations and a mesh sensi - tivity study was carried out to ensure that the results are minimally sensitive to the element size . ) To simulate the response of a pressurized shell , a uniform internal pressure was ﬁrst applied to the shell . A point load was then applied , while the internal pressure was kept con - stant , and the relationship between applied force F and maximum displacement w 0 was determined for a range of internal pressures and shell thicknesses . An image of the deformed shell from simulations is shown in ﬁgure 1 b . Two typical force – displacement curves are shown in ﬁgure 2 a . The ﬁrst curve shows the force – displacement curve in the absence of an internal pressure . In this case , we recover the two classical results for an unpressurized shell : for w 0 (cid:2) h , F (cid:2) w 0 , as shown by Reissner [ 13 ] , while for w 0 (cid:3) h , F (cid:2) w 1 = 2 0 as shown by Pogorelov [ 14 ] . However , with an internal pressure the results in ﬁgure 2 a show that there are two separate linear regimes . Further analysis reveals that the prefactor of this linear relationship in the ﬁrst regime , k 1 , differs from that in the unpressurized case . In this article , we focus on understanding the presence of these linear regimes and determining the two linear stiffnesses , k 1 and k 2 , in terms of the material properties of the system . In order to test the experimental applicability of our approach , we also performed a series of indenta - tion tests using an inﬂated rubber ball ( Pezzi ball , Ledragomma ) of radius R ¼ 18 . 5 cm , shell thickness h ¼ 1 mm . Young’s modulus was measured to be E ¼ 2 . 3 MPa ( by determining the linear relationship between internal pressure and shell circumference ) and we assume that the Poisson ratio v ¼ 0 . 5 , as is typi - cal of rubbers . The ball was inﬂated to a known pressure and then loaded using a hemispherical cap indentor ( ﬁgure 1 c ) at a constant speed . ( The radius of curvature of the indentor (cid:4) 3 mm , which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the horizontal length scale for the deforma - tion of the shell (cid:2) 3 cm , making this a satisfactory approximation to the point force assumed theoretically . Experiments were conducted at room temperature and the ball was supported by a wooden shelf with a cut - out hole to ensure alignment of the pole with the indentor . ) The force required to impose this displace - ment was measured continuously using a force gauge ( Andilog centor ) . Force – displacement curves for a range of internal pressures demonstrate that for small displacements the measured force is approximately linear in displacement with a prefactor that depends on the internal pressure ( ﬁgure 2 b ) . For the theoretical formulation of the problem , we start from the equations of axisymmetric plate theory modiﬁed to incorporate the ﬁnite radius of curvature of the shell . These equations are well known [ 23 ] and , in the polar geometry of interest here , take the form B r 4 w þ 1 R 1 r d d r ð r c Þ (cid:5) 1 r d d r c d w d r (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ p (cid:5) F 2 p d ð r Þ r ; ð 2 : 1 Þ F F w 0 F ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) p displacement 1 cm R r w ( r ) Figure 1 .

We use a Dirac d - function to represent the point forcing at the origin and have chosen the sign convention so that positive F acts in the opposite direction to the pressure , p . We thus expect positive forces to produce negative displacements . 3 . SMALL INDENTATION For the case of no applied point force , F ¼ 0 , we antici - pate that w ¼ w 1 , a constant . Substituting this ansatz into equation ( 2 . 1 ) , we ﬁnd that c ¼ pRr 2 : ð 3 : 1 Þ The shell is therefore in a uniform state of stress in which s uu ¼ s rr ¼ s 1 ¼ pR / 2 . To consider small deformations from this state , it is natural to perturb the base state given by equation ( 3 . 1 ) , letting w ! w þ w 1 and c ! c þ s 1 r . At leading order , we eliminate c from equation ( 2 . 1 ) by using equation ( 2 . 2 ) to ﬁnd that the displacement of the shell is governed by B r 4 w (cid:5) s 1 r 2 w þ Eh R 2 w ¼ (cid:5) F 2 p d ð r Þ r : ð 3 : 2 Þ We note that a balance between the term representing bending and the linear restoring force gives rise to a natu - ral bending length scale , ‘ b ¼ BR 2 Eh (cid:2) (cid:3) 1 = 4 (cid:2) ð hR Þ 1 = 2 : ð 3 : 3 Þ The appropriate solution of equation ( 3 . 2 ) subject to w ( 0 ) ¼ 2 w 0 is w ð r Þ ¼ (cid:5) 2 w 0 log ð l (cid:5) = l þ Þ K 0 l 1 = 2 þ r ‘ b !

We note that the coefﬁcients of the K 0 terms in equation ( 3 . 4 ) are chosen such that there is no logarithmic singularity close to the point of indenta - tion . The parameter t represents a dimensionless pressure .

The lack of a signiﬁcant discrepancy between repeated experiments demonstrates the reproducibility of our results as well as the unimportance of frictional and rate effects . The two solid lines represent the linear force laws F ¼ k 1 w 0 with the appropriate value of k 1 predicted by theory ( see § 3 ) . 450 Indenting pressurized elastic shells D . Vella et al . J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2012 ) with w 0 , h / 2 . ( We shall see that equation ( 3 . 6 ) is only valid in the limit w 0 (cid:2) h . ) The dependence of the measured values of k 1 on t is plotted with the theoreti - cal curve and numerical points in ﬁgure 3 and show that the measured stiffness is in good agreement with that expected from the theoretical analysis . The range of pressures used in our experiments are such that the Pezzi ball is a strongly pressurized shell ( i . e . t (cid:3) 1 ) , in which limit we ﬁnd k 1 (cid:2) 4 p B ‘ 2b t log 2 t ¼ p pR log 2 t : ð 3 : 7 Þ We note that for t (cid:2) 1 we recover the unpressurized result of Reissner [ 13 ] , which in our notation reads k 1 ¼ 8 B = ‘ 2b . These asymptotic results are shown in ﬁgure 3 for completeness . We also note that the result , equation ( 3 . 7 ) , is similar to that obtained from a simpli - ﬁed analysis of the indentation of a cylindrical cell [ 8 ] , albeit with a different prefactor . This similarity is to be expected on dimensional grounds . Finally , the force law f ¼ k 1 w 0 is expected to hold provided the effects of geometrical nonlinearities are relatively small , i . e . that the ﬁrst term on the right - hand side of equation ( 2 . 2 ) dominates the second term . Quantitatively , this requires that w 0 (cid:2) h . 4 . LARGE INDENTATION We now consider an indentation w 0 (cid:3) h . In this regime , we must carefully account for geometrical nonlinearities . Numerical simulations suggest that the force – displacement curve temporarily loses its linearity but ultimately regains it , albeit with a different stiffness , i . e . F (cid:2) k 2 w 0 . To understand this behaviour , it is impor - tant to consider the fully nonlinear problem described by equations ( 2 . 1 ) and ( 2 . 2 ) . However , to simplify the analy - sis we neglect the effect of bending stiffness , the biharmonic term in equation ( 2 . 1 ) . The coefﬁcient of the bending term in equation ( 2 . 1 ) is a fraction t 2 2 of the other terms and hence this approximation is valid provided that t (cid:3) 1 . With this simpliﬁcation , we ﬁnd that the shell equations may be integrated once and simpliﬁed to give F 2 p ¼ pr 2 2 þ c d w d r (cid:5) r R (cid:2) (cid:3) ; ð 4 : 1 Þ and r d d r 1 r d d r ð r c Þ (cid:4) (cid:5) ¼ Eh r R d w d r (cid:5) 1 2 d w d r (cid:2) (cid:3) 2 " # ; ð 4 : 2 Þ where we have used the behaviour c (cid:2) pRr / 2 as r ! 1 to eliminate the constant that arises upon integrating equation ( 2 . 2 ) . Having neglected the inﬂuence of the bending stiffness on this problem , a new length scale ‘ p ¼ pR Eh (cid:2) (cid:3) 1 = 2 R ð 4 : 3 Þ emerges from a balance between in - plane stretching and the geometric stretching caused by the internal pressure . We note that it is possible to transform equations ( 4 . 1 ) and ( 4 . 2 ) into a single equation for the stress func - tion c by eliminating d w / d r from equation ( 4 . 2 ) using equation ( 4 . 1 ) , as has been done previously for problems in planar membrane theory [ 25 , 26 ] . However , here we leave the equations in the above form and solve them numerically , using the M ATLAB routine bvp4c , subject to the boundary conditions w ð 0 Þ ¼ (cid:5) w 0 ; lim r ! 0 ð r c 0 (cid:5) nc Þ ¼ 0 and w ð 1 Þ ¼ 0 ; c 0 ð 1 Þ ¼ pR 2 9 = ; : ð 4 : 4 Þ The second boundary condition corresponds to the con - dition of zero horizontal displacement at the origin [ 27 ] . The force F is determined as part of the solution to this problem . Its dependence on the imposed displacement w 0 is shown as the solid black curve in ﬁgure 4 a and is compared with the simulation results obtained from A BAQUS , shown by the coloured curves , as well as exper - imental results , shown by points . This comparison shows good agreement between the theoretical result , simulations and experiment with the discrepancies accounted for by our neglect of the bending stiffness , B , in this membrane model . Figure 4 a suggests that in the limit of very large displacements we ﬁnd F / pRw 0 . To understand this be - haviour for large forces , we introduce the dimensionless force f F g ¼ F = 2 p p ‘ 2p .

Far away from the point of indentation , we expect that the left - hand side of equation ( 4 . 6 ) can be approxi - mated by 0 , giving F (cid:4) j 1 – h / 2 j . Substituting this into equation ( 4 . 5 ) , we ﬁnd then that v ¼ 0 for h . 2 and v ¼ h – 2 for h , 2 . Upon rewriting v ¼ h – 2 in dimen - sional terms and requiring that w ( 0 ) ¼ – w 0 we ﬁnd that in the limit w 0 (cid:3) ‘ 2 p = R the deformation of the shell is described by w ¼ (cid:5) w 0 þ r 2 R ; r (cid:6) ð w 0 R Þ 1 = 2 ; 0 ; r . ð w 0 R Þ 1 = 2 ; 8 < : ð 4 : 7 Þ which is simply the inverted spherical cap found by Pogorelov [ 14 ] for the case of unpressurized shells— also commonly known as ‘mirror buckling’ .

We note that in equation ( 4 . 7 ) the shell is only deformed for r , ( w 0 R ) 1 / 2 —the ﬂat regions for r . ( w 0 R ) 1 / 2 in ﬁgure 4 b indicate that the shell is not deformed in this region . The above analysis also demonstrates that F (cid:2) p pRw 0 . Alternatively , we may understand the linear force law that is observed in this regime by noting that the decrease in volume of the shell caused by this deformation is D V (cid:4) p Rw 20 = 2 and hence that the work done by the loading force in compressing the gas within the shell , p D V (cid:4) p pRw 20 = 2 . Differentiating this expression with respect to w 0 , we ﬁnd that the applied force F (cid:2) p pRw 0 : ð 4 : 8 Þ The asymptotic result ( 4 . 8 ) is conﬁrmed by the numeri - cal solution of the membrane models ( 4 . 1 ) and ( 4 . 2 ) , as shown by the dotted black line in ﬁgure 4 a . 5 . DISCUSSION AND APPLICATIONS We have studied the indentation of a pressurized elastic shell and shown that the force – displacement curve exhibits two linear regimes ( at small and large deﬂec - tions compared with the thickness h ) . For strongly pressurized shells , we found that F (cid:2) k 1 w 0 for w 0 (cid:2) h and F (cid:2) k 2 w 0 for w 0 (cid:3) h where k 1 (cid:2) p pR log 2 t ; k 2 (cid:2) p pR and t ¼ 1 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 3 ð 1 (cid:5) n 2 Þ p pR 2 Eh 2 (cid:3) 1 9 > > = > > ; : ð 5 : 1 Þ We validated these analytical results using ﬁnite - element simulations and macroscopic experiments . The analytical understanding of these two regimes gained here may be used to determine both p and Eh 2 using data from a single indentation experiment in which both k 1 and k 2 are measured . This is in contrast to previous techniques [ 20 ] , which required a single stiff - ness to be measured in two different experimental 10 −2 1 10 2 10 4 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 1 10 10 2 10 3 10 4 ( a ) ( b ) F / p 2p w 0 R / 2p 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 −1 . 0 −0 . 8 −0 . 6 −0 . 4 −0 . 2 0 w / w 0 r / ( w 0 R ) 1 / 2 Figure 4 .

Vella et al . J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2012 ) geometries in combination with numerical simulation . Our technique is particularly useful when it is the internal swelling pressure ( or osmotic pressure ) that is to be measured , since the result in equation ( 5 . 1 ) shows that the stiffness k 2 depends only on this pressure and the radius of the capsule . We note that the experiments of Gordon et al . [ 20 ] appear to be precisely in this regime since , using their estimates , the para - meter w 0 R = ‘ 2p (cid:2) 100 (cid:3) 1 . Using the asymptotic result ( 5 . 1 ) , we ﬁnd that their experimental data suggest internal pressures ranging from 15 to 120 Pa ( assuming a capsule radius of 100 m m ) . This is in reasonable agree - ment with the values given by them ( 100 – 500 Pa ) but is less sensitive to errors in ﬁtting since it is not necessary to estimate the elastic properties of the shell as well . Our results may also be applied to understand recent experiments [ 22 ] on yeast cells , Saccharomyces cerevi - siae , in which indentation with an AFM tip was used to determine changes in the cell’s stiffness as the osmotic pressure of the external medium was varied . These experiments were performed for indentations of the order of the wall thickness ( maximum indentation (cid:4) 50 nm compared with a typical wall thickness [ 6 ] h (cid:4) 70 nm ) and hence the measured stiff - ness corresponds to k 1 in our notation . The cell wall of yeast is known to be permeable allowing material to ﬂow out of the cell and equilibrate non - osmotic pressure differences [ 28 ] . Although this ﬂow could in principle be modelled [ 28 ] , the relatively small size of indentations , together with the experimental observation that results are unchanged upon varying the indentation speed , suggest that the assumption made in our analysis of constant pressure difference during indentation is satis - factory . Other complications include the layered structure of the yeast cell wall , with not all layers con - tributing equally to its mechanical strength [ 29 ] , and the potentially complicated constitutive law relating stresses and strains . Nevertheless , the application of the theoretical understanding developed from the ideal - ized model presented in this paper gives us a starting point for extracting characteristic moduli and values for the internal osmotic pressure . The principle result of the indentation experiments of Arfsten et al . [ 22 ] is that the value of k 1 depends on the osmotic pressure of the external medium ( ﬁgure 5 a ) . Furthermore , they found that above a criti - cal external osmotic pressure , P ext ¼ 2 . 1 MPa , this stiffness becomes signiﬁcantly smaller . From this obser - vation , it was concluded that the cell is effectively deﬂated when P ext ¼ 2 . 1 MPa and hence that the internal osmotic pressure of the cell is P int ¼ 2 . 1 MPa . Strictly speaking , this value is the maximal osmotic pressure that the cell can generate . Our analysis suggests that , as the pressure difference decreases , a residual stiffness should remain and be explained by the analysis of Reissner [ 13 ] . Using this result and typi - cal estimates for the thickness of the cell wall h (cid:4) 70 nm and cell radius R (cid:4) 2 . 75 m m from the literature [ 6 ] , we take the measured upper and lower bounds for k 1 ( see dashed lines in ﬁgure 5 a ) and estimate that 12 MPa (cid:6) E (cid:6) 46 MPa . This value is reasonably consistent with values determined previously [ 5 , 30 ] and also gives ‘ p (cid:4) 2 m m and ‘ b (cid:4) 200 m m , which are both signiﬁ - cantly larger than the AFM tip used ( (cid:3) 15 nm ) justifying our approximation of a point force . With this value of E , the theory developed here , more speciﬁ - cally equation ( 3 . 6 ) , can be used to estimate the internal pressure required to obtain the observed values of k 1 . The results of this calculation are shown in ﬁgure 5 b and indicate that as the external pressure is increased so the internal pressure is actively increased to maintain a certain degree of turgor , i . e . an internal osmotic pressure that is higher than that of the external medium . Beyond P int ¼ 0 . 6 MPa the cell becomes unable to maintain turgor . 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 ( a ) 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 ( b ) P i n t ( M P a ) P ext ( MPa ) P ext ( MPa ) k 1 ( N m – 1 ) Figure 5 .

Here , we have used the data at larger external pressure to determine Young’s modulus of the cell wall and then to estimate the pressure difference felt by the cell at lower exter - nal osmotic pressures , thereby inferring the internal pressure . Indenting pressurized elastic shells D . Vella et al . 453 J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2012 ) We ﬁnd a typical value of turgor of 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 MPa , which is consistent with experiments using different methodologies [ 30 , 31 ] , which found turgor pressures in the range 0 – 1 MPa . Finally , we note that for these experiments 0 (cid:3) t (cid:3) 10 and so it is necessary to make use of the full analytical expression ( 3 . 6 ) . This is par - ticularly important for explaining the presence of a residual stiffness when the yeast cell is unable to main - tain turgor ( for external pressures P ext (cid:2) 0 . 6 MPa ) . As Arfsten et al . [ 22 ] surmised , the presence of this stiff - ness demonstrates that the role of bending effects cannot be neglected as turgor decreases—an assump - tion that is often made in simpliﬁed models of cell indentation [ 8 , 9 ] . We anticipate that our analytical results , and particu - larly the asymptotic results ( 5 . 1 ) for strongly pressurized shells , could provide a standard tool for the mechanical characterization of pressurized shells in a range of biolo - gical applications , such as the measurement of the properties of capsules and walled cells . Other features of the indentation of pressurized shells may also aid this aim . For example , under large deformations pressurized shells are subject to an azimuthal buckling instability that leads to the formation of a large number of wrinkles with a well - deﬁned length . The number of wrinkles as well as their length could thus be used for the mechanical characterizationofshells [ 32 , 33 ] . A full studyofthis wrink - ling is currently underway . D .
