CEACAM3 function depends on an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif ( ITAM ) - like sequence that is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src family kinases upon receptor engagement . The phosphorylated ITAM - like sequence triggers GTP - loading of Rac by directly associating with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) Vav . Rac stimulation in turn is critical for actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that generate lamellipodial protrusions and lead to bacterial uptake . PrincipalFindings : In our present study we provide biochemical and microscopic evidence that the adaptor proteins Nck1 and Nck2 , but not CrkL , Grb2 or SLP - 76 , bind to tyrosine phosphorylated CEACAM3 . The association is phosphorylation - dependent and requires the Nck SH2 domain . Overexpression of the isolated Nck1 SH2 domain , RNAi - mediated knock - down of Nck1 , or genetic deletion of Nck1 and Nck2 interfere with CEACAM3 - mediated bacterial internalization and with the formation of lamellipodial protrusions . Nck is constitutively associated with WAVE2 and directs the actin nucleation promoting WAVE complex to tyrosine phosphorylated CEACAM3 . In turn , dominant - negative WAVE2 as well as shRNA - mediated knock - down of WAVE2 or the WAVE - complex component Nap1 reduce internalization of bacteria . Conclusions : Our results provide novel mechanistic insight into CEACAM3 - initiated phagocytosis . We suggest that the CEACAM3 ITAM - like sequence is optimized to co - ordinate a minimal set of cellular factors needed to efficiently trigger actin - based lamellipodial protrusions and rapid pathogen engulfment .

In particular , CEACAM1 , CEACAM3 , CEA ( the product of the CEACAM5 gene ) , and CEACAM6 can serve as microbial receptors . As CEACAM - recognition has evolved independently in multiple Gram - negative bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N . meningitidis , as well as uropathogenic Escherichia coli , this trait seems to confer a selective advantage to these microbes in vivo [ 2 ] . All CEACAM - binding bacteria colonize the mucosal surface of the human nasopharynx , intestine or urogenital tract , where CEACAM family members are expressed on the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells [ 3 ] . In vivo experiments employing a humanized mouse model have demonstrated that CEACAM recognition can strongly promote the initial establishment of microorganisms on the mucosa [ 4 ] . In this context , bacterial stimulation of CEACAMs enhances the adhesiveness of the infected host cells , thereby suppressing the exfoliation of the superficial epithelial layer [ 4 , 5 ] . On the other hand , CEACAM family members such as CEACAM1 , CEACAM3 , or CEACAM6 are found on various hematopoietic cells . A common splice variant of CEACAM1 , which is present on mature B - cells and CD4 - positive T - cells , contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibition motifs ( ITIMs ) and has been reported to interfere with antibody production by B - cells [ 6 , 7 ] or CD4 T - cell proliferation , respec - tively , upon stimulation by CEACAM - binding bacteria [ 8 ] . Though this report has been challenged by recent observations PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 Month 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e32808 that both CEACAM - binding and non - binding N . gonorrhoeae stimulate T - cell proliferation and cytokine secretion to the same extent [ 9 ] , engagement of CEACAM1 on immune cells by pathogenic microbes might interfere with some effector functions of hematopoietic cells and thereby provide a selective advantage [ 10 ] . Interestingly , human granulocytes express a peculiar member of the CEACAM family , CEACAM3 , which shares a high degree of homology in its extracellular , bacteria - binding part with CEACAM1 , CEA , and CEACAM6 [ 11 ] . In contrast to CEACAM1 , the CEACAM3 cytoplasmic domain encompasses a tyrosine - based sequence that is reminiscent of an immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif ( ITAM ) . Canonical ITAM se - quences are found in the cytoplasmic parts of T - cell and B - cell receptor as well as Fc gamma receptor ( Fc c R ) subunits [ 12 ] . ITAMs are critical for transducing stimulatory signals and , in the case of phagocytes , promote bactericidal activities of these effector cells [ 13 ] . Interestingly , engagement of CEACAM3 by bacteria has been shown to result in rapid phagocytosis and elimination of the bacteria in an acid intracellular compartment [ 14 , 15 ] . Therefore , CEACAM3 - mediated recognition and opsonin - inde - pendent phagocytosis might be a specific adaptation of the human innate immune system to balance the colonization of mucosal surfaces by CEACAM - binding microbes . In line with the idea that CEACAM3 - mediated engulfment by granulocytes is to the disadvantage of the recognized microbes , several studies have demonstrated that this uptake process is mechanistically distinct from CEACAM1 , CEACAM6 or CEA - mediated internalisation [ 16 – 19 ] . For example , CEACAM3 - mediated internalisation strictly depends on actin cytoskeleton dynamics and does not involve cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich membrane microdo - mains [ 18 , 19 ] . Moreover , whereas CEA and CEACAM6 are glycosylphosphatidyl - inositol - anchored proteins and CEACAM1 lacking the cytoplasmic domain is competent for bacterial uptake , cytoskeletal rearrangements and efficient phagocytosis via CEA - CAM3 depend on the integrity of the cytoplasmic ITAM - like sequence [ 15 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . Starting with receptor clustering by multivalent bacteria , several steps in the CEACAM3 - initiated signalling pathway have been delineated in primary granulocytes and CEACAM3 - transfected cell lines . Most importantly , tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM - like sequence by Src - family protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) appears as the initial event , which guides the assembly of a transient signalling complex and which is blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of Src family kinases [ 17 , 18 , 21 ] . Upon phosphorylation of tyrosine residue Y230 within the ITAM - like sequence , this phospho - tyrosine serves as a docking site for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) Vav [ 22 ] . Direct association of the CEACAM3 ITAM with the SH2 domain of Vav provides a short - cut between receptor engagement and GTP - loading of the small G - protein Rac , which is a critical regulator of actin polymerization . Accordingly , dominant - negative versions of Rac , but not the closely related G - protein Cdc42 , severely reduce opsonin - independent phagocytosis of CEACAM - binding bacteria by primary human granulocytes [ 15 ] . In line with a central role of Rac in this process , a rapid increase in GTP - loaded Rac as well as the formation of large lamellipodial protrusions is observed in granulocytes infected with CEACAM - binding gonococci [ 15 , 23 ] . However , which Rac - dependent effectors contribute to actin polymerization in the vicinity of CEACAM3 - bound bacteria and how these effectors are recruited to the sites of bacterial uptake is currently unknown . In this study , we identified the adaptor molecules Nck1 and Nck2 as novel interacting partners of CEACAM3 . Biochemical analyses demonstrated that Nck1 and Nck2 , but not other adapter molecules such as Grb2 , CrkL , or SLP - 76 , bound to the ITAM - like sequence of CEACAM3 in a phosphorylation - dependent manner . In microscopic investigations , Nck1 clustered together with the receptor at sites of bacterial uptake and overexpression of the isolated SH2 - domain of Nck1 , siRNA - mediated knock - down of Nck1 , or genetic deletion of Nck1 and Nck2 interfered with CEACAM3 - mediated phagocytosis and the generation of lamelli - podial protrusions . Interestingly , Nck was found in a CEACAM3 - containing complex together with the Rac effector WAVE2 , which promoted f - actin polymerization during uptake of CEACAM3 - associated bacteria . Interference with WAVE complex function by RNAi or overexpression of dominant - negative WAVE2 reduced CEACAM3 - mediated internalization . These results suggest that CEACAM3 - associated Nck helps to bring together Rac effector molecules such as WAVE with receptor - bound Rac activators such as the GEF Vav to promote the local actin cytoskeleton rearrangements necessary for the opsonin - independent internal - isation of CEACAM - binding bacteria .

The fixed samples were washed with 0 . 1 M sodium - cacodylate buffer and quickly analyzed with a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) as described above . Subsequently , the samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol followed by critical point drying with CO 2 and sputter - coating with 5 nm gold - palladium in a BAL - TEC SCD 030 . The regions of interest were re - located according to the grid on CeLLocate coverslips and analyzed on a Zeiss Auriga CrossBeam Workstation operating at 15 kV using the secondary electron detector . Correlation of confocal and SEM images was achieved using Adobe Photoshop CS5 . shRNA construction and lentiviral production Recombinant lentiviral particles were generated using the plasmids pLKO . 1 , pLKO . 1 - shScrambled ( containing a non - targeting control shRNA - sequence ) , pMD2 . G , and psPAX2 provided by Addgene ( www . addgene . org ) and maintained in E . coli STBL4 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Using the algorithm AAGN 18 TT ( available online at http : / / jura . wi . mit . edu / bioc / siRNAext / ) we identified sequences that could silence expression of human WAVE2 or Nap1 ( NCKAP1 , HEM2 ) , respectively . According to this prediction , complementary primers were syn - thesized : hWAVE2 - shRNA - sense 5 9 - CCGGAAGCAACCAAA - GATATATCCACTCGAGTGGATATATCTTTGGTTGCT - TTTTTTG - 3 9 and hWAVE2 - shRNA - anti 5 9 - AATTCAAA - AAAAGCAACCAAAGATATATCCACTCGAGTGGATATA - TCTTTGGTTGCTT - 3 9 ; Nap1 : hNap1 - shRNA - sense 5 9 - CCG - GAAGAGCAGCAGCATATGTTGTCTCGAGACAACATA - TGCTGCTGCTCTTTTTTTG - 3 9 and hNap1 - shRNA - anti 5 9 - AATTCAAAAAAAGAGCAGCAGCATATGTTGTCTCGAG - ACAACATATGCTGCTGCTCTT - 3 9 . The oligos were an - nealed and cloned into the AgeI and EcoRI site of pLKO . 1 generating pLKO . 1 - shWAVE2 and pLKO . 1 - shNap1 , respective - ly . The correct insertion of the shRNA cassette was verified by sequencing . For lentiviral production , 2 6 10 6 293 cells were transiently transfected with 14 m g of the respective pLKO . 1 vector together with 10 m g of packaging plasmid psPAX2 and 7 m g of envelope - coding plasmid pMD2 . G . 48 h later , the virus - containing cell culture supernatant was collected , centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4 u C for 7 min and filtered through a 0 . 45 m m pore - size filter . 5 ml of the cleared viral supernatant was used to transduce 293 cells in 10 cm culture dishes . After 24 h , puromycin ( 0 . 4 m g / ml ) was added and the puromycin - resistant stable cell population was used in experiments after 6 days of selection . Quantification of bacterial uptake by flow cytometry Uptake of bacteria was quantified by flow cytometric analysis as described previously [ 25 ] . Briefly , 293 cells with stable knock down of WAVE2 , HEM2 or control transduced cells ( shScramble ) were transfected with HA - tagged CEACAM3 and 1 6 10 6 of the transfected cells were seeded in 6 well - plates the day before infection . Cells were infected at a MOI ( multiplicity of infection ) of 20 with CFSE - labeled non - opaque or Opa CEA - expressing N . gonorrhoeae for 1 h . After infection , cells were suspended in PBS , 1 % heat - inactivated FCS , 2 mg / ml trypan blue and analysed on a LSRII ( Becton Dickinson ) . The percentage of fluorescein - positive cells was multiplied by the mean fluorescence of these cells to obtain an estimate of the total amount of phagocytosed bacteria ( uptake index ) . In parallel , CEACAM expression by the transfected knock - down cells was determined by flow cytometry with a monoclonal anti - CEACAM antibody . The mean fluores - cence intensity of CEACAM3 staining was used to normalize the uptake index to correct for differences in the transfection efficiency of the three knock - down cell populations . Results The cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 associates with the adaptor protein Nck Phosphotyrosine - based signalling complexes often involve SH2 - domain containing adapter molecules . To identify adapter molecules potentially interacting with the ITAM - like sequence of CEACAM3 , we examined a panel of SH2 domains derived from different adaptor proteins for their capacity to interact with phosphorylated CEACAM3 . In a pull - down assay , GST - fusion proteins of SH2 domains derived from Grb2 , CrkL , Nck1 , or , as a positive control , the PTK c - Src were added to cell lysates containing phosphorylated full - length CEACAM3 . Phosphoryla - tion of CEACAM3 in the lysates was ensured by co - expression of vSrc , a constitutive active viral form of the cellular PTK c - Src , which phosphorylates CEACAM3 at tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic ITAM - like sequence [ 18 , 20 ] ( Fig . 1A ) . As expected , the recombinant c - Src SH2 domain fused to GST precipitated CEACAM3 from the lysate ( Fig . 1B ) . This is in line with previous reports that show co - localization and a direct association of Src family PTK SH2 domains with tyrosine phosphorylated CEA - Nck and WAVE2 in CEACAM3 - Mediated Phagocytosis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 Month 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e32808 Figure 1 .

Precipitates were analysed as in ( B ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0032808 . g001 Nck and WAVE2 in CEACAM3 - Mediated Phagocytosis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 Month 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e32808 CAM3 [ 18 , 21 ] . In contrast , GST alone or the SH2 domains of the adaptor proteins CrkL and Grb2 were not able to precipitate CEACAM3 . Importantly , the SH2 domain of Nck1 interacted strongly with CEACAM3 ( Fig . 1B ) . To analyse if the specific binding of Nck1 involves the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 , additional pull - down assays were performed using full - length CEACAM3 ( CEACAM3 WT ) and a deletion mutant of the receptor that lacks the complete cytoplasmic domain ( CEACAM3 D CT ) . Upon transfection of 293 cells and preparation of lysates , CEACAM3 WT or CEACAM3 D CT were present at similar levels ( Fig . 1C ) . However , the Nck1 SH2 domain associated only with full - length , but not with truncated CEACAM3 ( Fig . 1D ) . Again , the association was specific for the SH2 domain of Nck1 and was not observed for GST alone or the SH2 domain of Grb2 ( Fig . 1D ) . SH2 - domain - mediated interactions require an intact phospho - tyrosine binding pocket . In Nck1 , a crucial arginine residue is located in this binding pocket at position 308 ( R308 ) of the full length Nck1 protein . Accordingly , we performed site - directed mutagenesis and replaced R308 for lysine . In contrast to the wildtype Nck1 SH2 domain , the resulting Nck1 - R308K - SH2 domain lost its ability to associate with CEACAM3 ( Fig . 1E ) , demonstrating that the observed interaction is mediated by a phospho - tyrosine - directed binding of the Nck1 SH2 domain . Nck1 and Nck2 bind to the phosphorylated cytoplasmatic domain of CEACAM3 In humans , two Nck homologues , Nck1 and Nck2 , are expressed in most cell types [ 25 ] . To analyze the ability of either of these two proteins to associate with CEACAM3 , we employed GST fusion proteins of the SH2 domains of either Nck1 or Nck2 . Lysates were prepared from 293 cells transfected with GFP , CEACAM3 WT - GFP , or CEACAM3 D CT - GFP in the presence or absence of v - Src ( Fig . 2A ) . Using these lysates in pull - down analyses , both the Nck1 as well as the Nck2 SH2 domain were able to bind to full - length CEACAM3 , but not to CEACAM3 D CT ( Fig . 2B ) . Again , binding of the Nck1 and Nck2 SH2 domains to CEACAM3 WT was comparable to the interaction found for the c - Src SH2 domain ( Fig . 2B ) . In contrast to Nck , the SH2 domains of the two adapter proteins SLP76 and Grb2 , or GST alone did not associate with CEACAM3 ( Fig . 2B ) . Importantly , association of Nck1 and Nck2 with CEACAM3 depended on tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain , as binding did not occur , if CEACAM3 was not co - expressed with vSrc ( Fig . 2A ) . In all cases , GST and GST - SH2 domains were employed in comparable amounts as shown by Coomassie staining of the blotted precipitates ( Fig . 2B , lower panels ) . Together , these results demonstrate that both Nck1 and Nck2 SH domains can specifically bind to the phosphorylated cytoplasmatic domain of CEACAM3 . CEACAM3 and Nck1 co - localize at sites of bacterial attachment Upon infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae , CEACAM3 clustering triggers recruitment of Src - family PTKs to the bacteria - engaged receptor [ 21 ] . To localize the potential interaction of Nck with the bacteria - associated receptor , we co - transfected 293 cells with constructs encoding the red - fluorescent protein mKate fused to the carboxy - terminus of wildtype CEACAM3 ( CEACAM3 - mKate ) together with either GFP , the GFP - tagged Nck1 SH2 domain ( GFP - Nck1 - SH2 ) or the GFP - tagged , mutated Nck1 SH2 domain ( GFP - Nck1R308K - SH2 ) . All constructs were successfully ex - pressed at moderate levels suitable for analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy . As expected , CEACAM3 - mKate was predominantly found in cellular membranes ( Fig . 3A ) . Following infection with CEACAM - binding gonococci , CEACAM3 - mKate clustered at sites of bacterial engagement , but this did not result in re - distribution of GFP ( Fig . 3A ) . Clearly , the GFP - fused Nck1 SH2 domain was strongly recruited to the contact sites of CEACAM3 and bacteria ( Fig . 3A ; arrowhead ) . This recruitment was evident for bacteria during the initial uptake process in the cell periphery , but not for bacteria in a perinuclear , intracellular position Figure 2 . Nck1 and Nck2 bind to the tyrosine phosphorylated cytoplasmatic domain of CEACAM3 . ( A ) 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP - and HA - tagged CEACAM3 wild type ( WT ) , CEACAM3 D CT , or GFP and cotransfected or not with vSrc . Whole cell lysates ( WCL ) were analysed by Western blot with monoclonal anti - GFP antibody . ( B ) Lysates as in ( A ) were precipitated with the indicated GST - SH2 - domain fusion proteins or GST alone .

The membranes were stained with Coomassie Brillliant Blue ( Coomassie ) to verify equal amounts of GST or GST - fusion proteins in the precipitates ( lower panel ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0032808 . g002 Nck and WAVE2 in CEACAM3 - Mediated Phagocytosis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 6 Month 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e32808 suggesting that Nck recruitment is transient . In contrast to the wildtype Nck1 SH2 domain , Nck1R308K - SH2 , which did not interact with phosphorylated CEACAM3 , did not accumulate in response to bacterial CEACAM3 engagement and remained evenly distributed throughout the cell ( Fig . 3A ) . In line with the selective recruitment of the isolated Nck1 SH2 domain , also GFP - tagged full length Nck1 ( GFP Nck1 FL ) was strongly recruited to sites of bacterial attachment in 293 cells expressing a red fluorescent protein tagged CEACAM3 ( Fig . 3B ) . The formation of a complex between Nck1 and CEACAM3 in intact cells was verified by co - immunoprecipitation of full length Nck1 together with CEACAM3 from cell lysates with co - expression of vSrc ( Fig . 3C ) . These results provide evidence that a CEACAM3 - Nck complex is formed in intact cells upon bacterial engagement of Figure 3 . Association of Nck1 and CEACAM3 occurs in intact cells upon N . gonorrhoeae infection .

Overexpression of the Nck SH2 domain or knock - down of Nck1 reduce bacterial uptake via CEACAM3 If the observed specific recruitment of Nck1 to clustered CEACAM3 would have a functional role for bacterial internal - ization , then blocking access of Nck to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor should interfere with the uptake process . Therefore , we overexpressed the isolated Nck1 SH2 domain or the SLP - 76 SH2 domain together with CEACAM3 and monitored bacterial internalization by gentamicin protection assays . In line with the idea that association of Nck1 with CEACAM3 is needed for efficient internalization of bacteria , overexpression of the Nck1 , but not the SLP - 76 SH2 domain reduced the uptake of CEACAM - binding gonococci significantly by about 25 % ( Fig . 4A ) . In contrast , adhesion of bacteria to CEACAM3 - expressing cells was not diminished in the presence of the Nck1 SH2 domain ( Fig . 4B ) . Though these results suggest that Nck is involved in the CEACAM3 - mediated uptake of N . gonorrhoeae , the isolated SH2 domain of Nck1 could interfere with other SH2 domain - dependent processes such as recruitment of Src family PTKs to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor . Therefore , we depleted endogenous Nck1 by siRNA in CEACAM3 - expressing HeLa cells . Knock - down of Nck1 was only partial and reduced the amount of Nck1 by about 60 % ( Fig . 4C ) . However , this partial reduction led to a significant decrease in CEACAM3 - mediated uptake of gonococci compared to untreated or control siRNA - treated cells ( Fig . 4C ) . As a further control , HeLa cells , that do not express any CEACAM member endogenously , did not internalize gonococci ( Fig . 4C ) . Together with the biochemical and microscopic analysis , these results identify a functional role for the adapter molecule Nck in regulating the CEACAM3 - initiated uptake of bacteria . Genetic deletion of Nck1 and Nck2 interferes with CEACAM3 - mediated uptake In most cells , Nck1 and Nck2 have overlapping functions . Therefore , we employed fibroblasts derived from homozygote Nck1 / Nck2 - deficient mouse embryos ( Nck1 2 / 2 Nck2 2 / 2 cells ) and compared them to heterozygote control cells ( derived from Figure 4 . Nck has a functional role in CEACAM3 - mediated uptake of bacteria .

The fibroblasts were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP - tagged CEACAM3 and infected with biotinylated , Pacific blue - labelled Opa CEA - express - ing N . gonorrhoeae . After 60 minutes infection , the fixed samples were stained for extracellular bacteria with streptavidin - Alexa - fluor647 allowing detection of cell - associated versus intracellular bacteria ( Fig . 5A ) . Though intracellular bacteria were found in all CEACAM3 - expressing fibroblasts , the amount of intracellular bacteria in Nck1 2 / 2 Nck2 2 / 2 cells was strongly diminished compared to Nck1 + / 2 Nck2 + / 2 cells ( Fig . 5A ) . Quantification of intracellular bacteria revealed that Nck - deficiency reduced bacterial uptake by about 60 % ( Fig . 5B ) . Western blotting confirmed the lack of intact Nck1 and Nck2 in cell lysates of Nck1 2 / 2 Nck2 2 / 2 cells ( Fig . 5C ) . Together , these data support the idea that the adaptor proteins Nck1 and Nck2 contribute to the efficient CEACAM3 - mediated phagocytosis of bacteria . Nck1 and Nck2 - deficient cells lack CEACAM3 - initiated lamellipodia Nck adapter proteins are often help to locally organize dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton upon stimulation of membrane receptors . As CEACAM3 - initiated uptake of bacteria is accom - panied by actin re - arrangements leading to large lamellipodial membrane protrusions [ 15 , 16 ] , we wondered whether Nck adapter proteins might be critical for this process . To address this question , we implemented correlative light - electron micros - copy ( CLEM ) to visualize lamellipodial structures in response to bacterial CEACAM3 stimulation in the presence or absence of Figure 5 . Nck1 - Nck2 - deficient fibroblasts show diminished CEACAM3 - mediated uptake of bacteria . ( A ) Nck1 / Nck2 - deficient mouse fibroblasts ( Nck1 2 / 2 Nck2 2 / 2 ) and Nck1 and Nck2 - expressing fibroblasts ( Nck1 + / 2 Nck2 + / 2 ) were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP - tagged CEACAM3 and infected with biotinylated , Pacific blue - labelled Opa CEA - expressing N . gonorrhoeae . 60 minutes after infection , extracellular bacteria were stained with streptavidin - Alexafluor647 allowing detection of intracellular bacteria by their selective Pacific blue staining ( arrowheads ) .

To this end , Nck1 + / 2 Nck2 + / 2 and Nck1 2 / 2 Nck2 2 / 2 cells were transiently transfected with CEA - CAM - GFP and infected with fluorescence labelled Opa CEA protein - expressing gonococci . Both , Nck - expressing and Nck - deficient fibroblasts bound equal numbers of gonococci and the Opa CEA protein - expressing bacteria led to clustering of CEA - CAM3 - GFP , as visualized by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 6 ) . Upon further processing , the identical cells were re - analysed by scanning electron microscopy allowing high resolution observation of surface structures ( Fig . 6 ) . Whereas CEACAM3 - bound bacteria on the surface of Nck1 2 / 2 Nck2 2 / 2 cells were surrounded by small filopodia , large lamellipodial protrusions were evident in a radius up to 6 m m in the vicinity of gonococci in contact with CEACAM3 on Nck - expressing fibroblasts ( Fig . 6 ) . Therefore , this CLEM investigation provides direct evidence that Nck adapter proteins are involved in CEACAM3 - initiated , actin cytoskeleton - based subcellular structures . CEACAM3 associates with a Nck - and WAVE - containing multiprotein complex upon bacterial engagement CEACAM3 - mediated uptake of bacteria is strictly dependent on actin polymerisation orchestrated by the small GTPase Rac [ 15 ] . A well characterized effector of GTP - bound Rac is the WAVE / Scar - complex that promotes f - actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 26 , 27 ] . One critical component of the WAVE complex , Nap1 ( Nck - associated protein 1 , also termed NCKAP1 or Hem2 ) , is a known binding partner of the SH3 domain of Nck . Giving the role of Nck in CEACAM3 - initiated lamellipodia formation , we wondered whether Nck could help to localize the WAVE complex to CEACAM3 . Accordingly , 293 cells were transfected with GFP , CEACAM3 WT - GFP , or CEACAM3 D CT - GFP together with myc - tagged WAVE2 and then infected with CEACAM - binding gonococci . Confocal microscopy revealed that WAVE2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in cells expressing GFP irrespective of bacterial infection ( Fig . 7A ) . However , WAVE2 was strongly recruited to sites of bacterial engagement of CEACAM3 in cells expressing the wildtype receptor ( Fig . 7A ) . In contrast , WAVE2 was not redistributed in cells expressing truncated CEACAM3 ( CEACAM3 D CT - GFP ) , even though CEACAM3 D CT - GFP bound bacteria similar to the wildtype receptor ( Fig . 7A ) . Immunoprecipitation of WAVE2 from cells cotransfected or not with myc - tagged Nck and vSrc revealed a constitutive association of WAVE2 and Nck , which was not dependent on the presence of vSrc ( Fig . 7B ) . This is in line with the idea that Nck binds to the WAVE complex in a phosphotyrosine - independent , SH3 domain - dependent manner . To test the possibility that Nck connects phosphorylated CEACAM3 with the WAVE complex , we transfected 293 cells with combinations of CEACAM3 - WT - HA , GFP - WAVE2 , myc - Nck1 , and vSrc . Expression of all the constructs at equivalent levels was verified by Western blotting ( Fig . 7C ) . Upon immunoprecipitation of GFP - WAVE2 , the resulting precipitates were probed for the presence of myc - Nck and CEACAM3 - HA ( Fig . 7D ) . Again , a constitutive association of Nck with WAVE2 was detected , which did not depend on the presence of CEACAM3 or v - Src ( Fig . 7D ) . However , CEACAM3 WT was only present in WAVE2 precipitates , if the cells co - expressed myc - Nck and vSrc demonstrating that Nck orchestrates the complex formation between tyrosine phosphorylated CEACAM3 and the Rac effector WAVE2 ( Fig . 7D ) . Figure 6 . Nck1 and Nck2 - deficient cells lack CEACAM3 - initiated lamellipodia . Nck1 and Nck2 - expressing fibroblasts ( Nck1 + / 2 / Nck2 + / 2 , upper panel ) and Nck1 / Nck2 - deficient mouse fibroblasts ( Nck1 2 / 2 / Nck2 2 / 2 , lower panel ) were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP - tagged CEACAM3 and infected with Pacific blue - labelled Opa CEA - expressing N . gonorrhoeae for 30 minutes . Fixed samples were first analyzed by confocal laser - scanning microscopy and the identical cells were imaged in a second step by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) .

To test the functional significance of the WAVE complex in bacterial uptake , we used a dominant negative variant of WAVE2 that lacks the carboxy - terminal VCA domain ( WAVE2 D VCA ) . WAVE2 D VCA is not able to associate with the Arp2 / 3 complex and , therefore , disrupts WAVE - initiated actin nucleation [ 26 ] . Similar to wildtype WAVE2 , WAVE2 D VCA was strongly recruited to sites of bacterial contact with CEACAM3 ( Fig . 8A ) . This result suggests that the Arp2 / 3 complex - binding VCA domain of WAVE2 is not required for the Nck - mediated localization to phosphorylated CEACAM3 . However , overexpres - sion of WAVE2 D VCA severely impaired the CEACAM3 - mediated uptake of N . gonorrhoeae without effecting bacterial binding to the cells ( Fig . 8B ) . These results demonstrate that the Nck binding partner WAVE2 is involved in CEACAM3 - mediated phagocytosis . The WAVE complex is involved in actin rearrangements during CEACAM3 - mediated phagocytosis To further corroborate the functional role of WAVE2 and the WAVE complex during CEACAM3 - mediated uptake of bacte - ria , we generated cell populations with shRNA - mediated knock - down of WAVE2 or Nap1 , the Nck - binding component of the WAVE complex . Furthermore , control cells were transduced with a recombinant lentivirus encoding a non - targeting , control shRNA ( shScramble ) . After puromycin selection , the successful knock - down was verified by Western Blotting , which demon - strated that WAVE2 and Nap1 expression were reduced by about 70 % and 60 % , respectively ( Fig . 9A ) . Virally transduced cell populations were transfected with a HA - tagged CEACAM3 construct .

However , Opa CEA protein - expressing gonococci were efficiently internalized by the shScramble transduced cells . Strikingly , both the WAVE2 - as well as the Nap1 - knock - down cells showed a decreased uptake of Opa CEA protein - expressing gonococci ( Fig . 9B ) . Though the shRNA - mediated knock - down was incomplete , the 50 to 60 % decrease of bacterial phagocytosis by the WAVE2 - and Nap1 - knock - down cells compared to the control cell ( shScramble ) corresponds well to the extent of diminished expression of these two proteins . These results corroborate the functional role of Figure 9 . Knock - down of WAVE complex components interferes with CEACAM3 - mediated uptake of bacteria .

During CEACAM3 - initiated phagocytosis , GTP - loaded Rac stimulates massive actin polymerization leading to lamellipodial protrusions [ 15 ] and our results suggested that CEACAM3 - associated Nck was also involved in this phenotype . Therefore , we speculated that the Nck - associated WAVE complex might be the critical Rac effector involved in actin polymerization in the vicinity of CEACAM3 - binding bacteria . To address this question , we co - transfected 293 cells with CEACAM3 and either GFP or GFP - tagged , dominant - negative WAVE2 D VCA . Whereas a strong accumulation of f - actin was observed in GFP - expressing cells at the sites of bacteria - initiated CEACAM3 clustering , accumulation of f - actin was absent in WAVE2 D VCA expressing cells ( Fig . 9C ) . Together , these results suggest that Nck has a functional role in orchestrating CEACAM3 - initiated signalling to the actin cytoskel - eton by localizing the actin polymerization promoting activity of the WAVE complex . Accordingly , the adapter molecule Nck helps to convert the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 into a sophisticated signalling hub , where upon receptor stimulation Rac GEFs such as Vav are brought into close proximity to Rac effectors such as WAVE to promote efficient , opsonin - indepen - dent phagocytosis of CEACAM3 - attached microbes . Discussion Several human specific pathogens are able to engage CEACAM family members to colonize mucosal surfaces [ 2 , 4 ] ) . On the other hand , human granulocytes are equipped with CEACAM3 to detect and eliminate CEACAM - binding bacteria in an opsonin - independent manner [ 11 , 15 ] . Here we demonstrate that the adapter molecule Nck is a critical element in the CEACAM3 - initiated signalling cascade that helps to connect bacterial recognition via CEACAM3 with rapid actin - dependent phagocytosis . Nck associates in a phosphotyrosine - dependent manner with the intracellular ITAM - like sequence of CEACAM3 and knock - down of Nck or overexpression of the isolated SH2 domain impair CEACAM3 - mediated uptake of N . gonorrhoeae . Nck positions the WAVE complex to the clustered receptor promoting local actin polymerization and rapid engulf - ment of attached bacteria . These results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 , by bringing together the Rac stimulator Vav as well as Rac effectors such as WAVE , functions as a specialized organizing center optimized to trigger efficient , opsonin - independent phagocytosis of CEACAM - binding bacteria ( Fig . 10 ) . Nck adapter proteins have been recognized as important regulators of growth factor receptor - and integrin - stimulated signals that control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton [ 25 ] . For example , Nck adapter proteins are critical for the actin polymerization - driven dorsal ruffle formation upon growth factor stimulation , a process that resembles lamellipodia formation during phagocytosis [ 28 ] . Nck1 and Nck2 are co - expressed in most tissues and mediate redundant functions , as single knock - out of either gene does not impair the overall function of the organism , whereas deletion of both genes results in embryonic lethality [ 24 ] . In line with their overlapping function , Nck1 and Nck2 seem to interact with a similar set of proteins via either their SH2 or their SH3 domains [ 29 ] . Our studies also support the idea that Nck1 and Nck2 SH2 domains bind to the same target proteins , as both are able to precipitate tyrosine phosphorylated CEACAM3 in our assays . Crystallization of the Nck1 and Nck2 SH2 domains together with phosphorylated target peptides as well as biochem - ical binding studies have revealed that both adapters can accommodate a similar set of phospho - peptides [ 30 ] . The consensus motif for Nck - SH2 domain binding has revealed a preference for one or two acidic amino acids carboxy - terminal to the phospho - tyrosine in the form of pY - D / E - D / E - V [ 30 ] . Indeed , one of the two tyrosine residues within the ITAM - like sequence of CEACAM3 is followed by two negatively charged amino acids in the form of Y - E - E - L , which closely matches the characterized motif and supports the idea that the Nck SH2 domain directly associates with the cytoplasmic part of CEACAM3 . Importantly , Nck also participates in Fc c receptor - and T - cell receptor ( TCR ) - initiated signaling events that involve ITAM phosphorylation [ 29 , 31 ] . There , Nck associates with the activated receptors via additional , tyrosine - phosphorylated adapter mole - cules such as c - Cbl or SLP - 76 , respectively . In the context of T - cell stimulation , Nck is associated with the TCR complex via SLP - 76 and recruits the Wiskott - Aldrich - Syndrome protein ( WASP ) , which binds to the carboxy - terminal SH3 domain of Nck [ 32 , 33 ] . Besides Nck , phosphorylated SLP - 76 also binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav [ 34 ] . Interestingly , SLP - 76 bears multiple Y - E - X - P motifs in its amino - terminal part that bind the SH2 domains of Nck and Vav , though they are clearly distinct from the optimal Nck SH2 ( pY - D / E - D / E - V ) or Vav SH2 ( pY - M - E - P ) recognition sequences as determined by phospho - peptide scanning [ 30 , 35 ] . A similar situation exists for CEA - CAM3 , where the Y - E - E - L motif surrounding Y - 230 directly associates with the Vav SH2 domain [ 22 ] and might also be responsible for Nck binding . By the help of Nck , SLP - 76 brings into proximity a stimulator ( Vav ) as well as an effector ( WASP ) of GTP - bound small Rho GTPases to locally organize the actin cytoskeleton [ 33 , 34 ] . It is enticing to speculate that a similar role is carried out by the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM3 and thereby this receptor directly , without intermediary adaptor proteins , recruits the machinery for rapid actin polymerization . The assembly of such an actin regulating signalling complex by the cytplasmic portion of CEACAM3 might also explain why the ITAM - like sequence of this receptor can trigger efficient phagocytosis in the absence of Syk or Zap70 [ 36 ] . These two tyrosine kinases are essential for cytoskeletal rearrangements initiated by canonical ITAM motifs [ 13 , 37 ] . For example , inhibition of Syk activity in macrophages compromises Fc c R - mediated phagocytosis . In contrast , CEA - CAM3 - mediated uptake of bacteria is not influenced by Syk inhibitors in primary granulocytes or by co - expression of Syk in CEACAM3 - transfected cell lines ( [ 36 ] ; Pils and Hauck , unpub - lished observations ) . Together , these findings suggest that CEACAM3 short wires receptor stimulation with efficient phagocytosis and , similar to phosphorylated SLP - 76 , achieves rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by optimizing the local environment for Rho GTPase signaling . Despite the conceptual similarities , there is one important difference in the SLP - 76 - mediated coordination of TCR - induced actin rearrangements at the immunological synapse and CEA - CAM3 - induced actin polymerization during phagocytosis . Upon TCR stimulation , the small GTPase Cdc42 is thought to trigger WASP - mediated actin cytoskeleton rearrangements [ 33 , 38 ] . In contrast , CEACAM stimulation in granulocytes is tightly linked to Rac GTP loading , and dominant - negative versions of Cdc42 do not interfere with N . gonorrhoeae internalization in CEACAM3 - transfect - ed human cell lines or primary human granulocytes [ 15 , 23 ] . How the selective recruitment and stimulation of either Cdc42 or Rac is achieved is currently unknown , as both TCR - as well as CEACAM3 - initiated signalling involve the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav [ 22 , 39 , 40 ] . Nevertheless , our findings that Nck associates with phosphorylated CEACAM3 and recruits the Nck and WAVE2 in CEACAM3 - Mediated Phagocytosis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 14 Month 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e32808 WAVE2 complex shed light on the downstream events following Rac GTP loading . WAVE2 is part of a pentameric complex that is intrinsically inactive [ 41 , 42 ] . Besides WAVE2 , Abi , and Brk1 , the complex contains the proteins Sra and Nap1 , which seem to shield the carboxy - terminal VCA domain of WAVE2 , thereby prevent - ing WAVE - initiated Arp2 / 3 complex stimulation and actin nucleation [ 27 , 43 ] . Though the precise details are currently unknown , the actin nucleation promoting activity of the WAVE complex appears to depend on multiple inputs including association with GTP - loaded Rac , binding to phosphoinositides , and phosphorylation of WAVE [ 42 , 44 , 45 ] that all seem to alter the conformation of the complex ( Fig . 10 ) . Interestingly , one integral component of the WAVE complex , Nap1 ( also termed NCKAP1 or Hem2 ) , has been initially identified as an Nck binding partner in a yeast - two - hybrid screen [ 46 , 47 ] . Interaction between Nap1 and Nck is mediated by proline - rich sequences in Nap1 and Nck SH3 domains allowing a constitutive , phosphorylation - independent association as also detected in our analysis . Though direct binding of the SH3 domain of IRSp53 , a BAR - domain containing protein localized at lamellipodial membrane protrusions , has been shown to contrib - ute to activation of the WAVE complex , it is not known , if the SH3 domain - mediated association of Nck with Nap1 can result in an allosteric activation of the complex [ 27 ] . However , the Nck - Nap1 interaction could clearly contribute to the subcellular localization of the WAVE complex , thereby directing the actin nucleation machinery to clustered and tyrosine phosphorylated CEACAM3 . Moreover , Nck could affect WAVE complex Figure 10 . Current model of CECAM3 signal transduction . Upon engagement of CEACAM3 by CEACAM - binding pathogens ( e . g . Neisseria gonorrhoeae expressing Opa CEA ) the ITAM - like sequence in the cytoplasmatic domain of the receptor is phosphorylated by Src family kinases ( SFKs ) on two tyrosine residues ( Y230 and Y241 ) that in turn serve as docking sites for several effector proteins . The Rac - GEF Vav directly binds to pY230 via its SH2 domain and activates Rac by facilitating GDP release . While Vav activates Rac , the adaptor molecule Nck is also recruited to CEACAM3 in a phosphotyrosine - dependent manner along with the WAVE complex . Nck constitutively associates with the WAVE complex , presumably by an SH3 domain - mediated interaction with Nap1 . The CEACAM3 - localized WAVE - complex can now be activated by a GTP - Rac induced conformational change from an inactive conformation ( dotted wedge ) to an active complex that exposes the VCA - domain of WAVE ( solid wedge ) to recruit the Arp2 / 3 complex . The activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , which initiates nucleation of actin filaments , most likely mediates lamellipodia formation during the opsonin - independent phagocytosis of CEACAM3 - binding bacteria . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0032808 . g010 Nck and WAVE2 in CEACAM3 - Mediated Phagocytosis PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 15 Month 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e32808 activation indirectly . In particular , Nck is known to bind the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Abl , that phosphorylates WAVE2 at tyrosine residue Y150 providing an essential post - translational modification for full activation of the WAVE complex [ 45 , 48 ] . Abl directly binds to Abi , another constituent of the WAVE complex , and additional interactions between Nck SH3 domains and Abl might facilitate or stabilize such an association . Nck also associates with the actin nucleation promoting factor N - WASP , an effector of GTP - loaded Cdc42 [ 25 ] . Nck / N - WASP driven actin polymerization is critical for pedestal formation in mammalian cells infected with enteropathogenic E . coli and for actin - based intracellular motility driven by the vaccinia virus protein A36R [ 49 – 51 ] . Based on our data , we can not rule out an involvement of WASP family members in CEACAM3 - induced lamellipodia formation . However , the dependence on Rac - GTP instead of Cdc42 - GTP point to the WAVE complex instead of WASP as potential downstream elements . In addition , other cellular factors , such as Spire or formins , could contribute to the proper organization of the actin cytoskeleton during the complex process of CEACAM3 - mediated internalization , either in parallel or in a sequential manner . Indeed , even in the absence of a functional ITAM - like sequence or upon deletion of the complete cytoplasmic domain , an inefficient , residual uptake of bacteria via CEACAM3 has been observed [ 15 , 16 ] , which might also explain the remaining uptake observed in Nck1 / Nck2 - deficient cells . However , based on our CLEM results on the lack of lamellipodial protrusions in Nck1 / 2 - deficient cells and based on the severe reduction of actin polymerization in the vicinity of clustered CEACAM3 in WAVE2 D VCA - expressing cells we suggest that the Nck - mediated local enrichment of the WAVE complex is the major actin nucleation promoting activity during CEACAM3 - mediated phagocytosis of bacteria . Our work reveals the extremely compact organization of CEACAM3 - initiated signalling that connects the opsonin - inde - pendent recognition of CEACAM - binding pathogens via the extracellular immunoglobulin domain with rapid phagocytosis initiated by the cytoplasmic domain . By recruiting in a tyrosine - phosphorylation dependent manner the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav as well as the Nck - WAVE module , the CEACAM3 ITAM - like sequence elegantly integrates an upstream activator and a downstream effector to provide an optimized subcellular microenvironment for Rac - dependent actin rearrange - ments . Indeed , CEACAM3 - mediated uptake by human granulo - cytes is exceptionally fast and results in a large number of internalized bacteria within 15 minutes after phagocyte encounter [ 15 , 18 , 22 ] . The involvement of few , but ubiquitously expressed signalling components not only explains why CEACAM3 can function as an efficient phagocytic receptor in different transfected cell lines , but also points to a minimal set of proteins needed for rapid and efficient engulfment of particles by human granulocytes .
