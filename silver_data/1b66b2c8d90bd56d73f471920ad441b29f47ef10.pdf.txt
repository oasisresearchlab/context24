[ CANCER RESEARCH 47 . 3039 - 3051 . June 15 , 1987 ] Review Transport of Molecules in the Tumor Interstitium : A Review1 Rakesh K . Jain Department of Chemical Engineering , Carnegie Mellon University , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15213 - 3890 Abstract The transport of fluid and solute molecules in the interstitium is governed by the biological and physicochemical properties of the inter stitial compartment as well as the physicochemical properties of the test molecule . The composition of the interstitial compartment of neoplastic tissues is significantly different from that of most normal tissues . In general the tumor interstitial compartment is characterized by large interstitial space , high collagen concentration , low proteoglycan and hyaluronate concentrations , high interstitial fluid pressure and flow , absence of anatomically well - defined functioning lymphatic network , high effective interstitial diffusion coefficient of macromolecules , as well as large hydraulic conductivity and interstitial convection compared to most normal tissues . While these factors favor movement of macromolecules in the tumor interstitium , high interstitial pressure and low microvascular pressure may retard extravasation of molecules and cells , especially in large tumors . These differences in transport parameters have major implications in tumor growth and mÃ©tastases , as well as in tumor detection and treatment . I . Introduction Most normal and neoplastic tissues can be divided into three subcompartments : vascular , interstitial , and cellular . In addi tion , most normal tissues also contain lymphatic channels in the interstitial compartment . Once a molecule used for cancer detection or treatment is injected into the blood stream , it encounters the following " resistances " before reaching the in - tracellular space : ( a ) distribution through vascular space ; ( b ) transport across microvascular wall ; ( c ) transport through in terstitial space ; and ( < / ) transport across cell membrane . Each of these transport processes may involve both convection and diffusion . In addition , in each of these subcompartments the molecule may ( a ) be metabolized and undergo degradation , ( b ) bind nonspecifically to proteins or other components , or ( c ) bind specifically to the target element ( s ) ( e . g . , an enzyme , an antigen ) involved in growth , detection , or treatment ( 1 - 4 ) . Most investigators to date have focused their research on understanding the biochemistry , biophysics , and molecular bi ology of cancer cells with limited attention paid to the in vivo interstitial environment they exist in . The advent of hybridoma technology and genetic engineering has led to large scale pro duction of monoclonal antibodies and other biologically useful molecules . If these molecules are to be used clinically , methods must be developed to deliver them selectively to the target cells in vivo ( 5 - 7 ) . Since no molecule can reach the tumor cells from blood without passing through the vascular and interstitial subcompartments , it seems reasonable to find out more about the structure and function of these two subcompartments . We have focused our research in the past few years on the experi mental and mathematical characterization of transport through Received 10 / 7 / 86 ; revised 3 / 9 / 87 ; accepted 3 / 20 / 87 . The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges . This article must therefore be hereby marked advertisement in accordance with 18 U . S . C . Section 1734 solely to indicate this fact . 1This article is based on research supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute , the National Science Foundation , and the Richard K . Mellon Foundation and by an NIH Research Career Development Award ( 1980 - 1985 ) and a Guggenheim Fellowship ( 1983 - 1984 ) . these two spaces . We have recently summarized our work on blood flow and exchange in the tumor vascular subcompartment elsewhere ( 8 , 9 ) . In what follows we will discuss our own findings on the interstitial transport in tumors as well as those of others . The transport of a solute or a fluid molecule in the intersti tium is governed by the physiological ( e . g . , pressure ) and phys icochemical properties ( e . g . , size , charge , structure , composi tion ) of the interstitial subcompartment as well as physicochem ical properties of the test molecule . These properties have been recently reviewed for normal tissues by several authors ( 10 - 15 ) . In this article we will discuss the tumor interstitial properties in the following order : volume , structure , and composition of the interstitial space ( Section II ) ; pressure - flow relationship in the interstitium ( Section III ) ; and interstitial transport param eters ( Section IV ) . For each parameter , we will outline the methods of measurement , discuss the key results , and finally point out the implications for tumor growth , detection , and treatment . II . Volume , Structure , and Composition of the Tumor Interstitial Space The interstitial subcompartment of a tumor is bounded by the walls of blood vessels on one side and by the membranes of cells on the other . In normal tissues , the blood vessels are surrounded by a basement membrane , which may be damaged or missing in tumors ( for review see , e . g . , Ref . 8 ) . In addition , the anatomically well - defined functioning lymphatic vessels present in normal tissues may be absent in solid tumors ( 16 ) . [ Note that a tumor may invade and hence incorporate lymphatic vessels of the host tissue . ] Similar to normal tissues , the inter stitial space of tumors is composed predominantly of a collagen and elastic fiber network . Interdispersed within this cross - linked structure are the interstitial fluid and macromolecular constit uents ( hyaluronate and proteoglycans ) which form a hydrophilic gel . It is sometimes convenient to divide the interstitial space into two compartments : the colic ; d - rich gel space containing the hydrophilic hyaluronate and proteoglycans ; and the colloid - poor free - fluid space . In this paper , we will discuss quantitative results on the volume and composition of each of these spaces . A . Volume of Interstitial Space The volume of the interstitial space is usually obtained by subtracting vascular space from the extracellular space . Vascu lar space is measured by a marker confined to blood vessels , and the extracellular space is measured by a marker excluded by cells . In a limited number of studies , these spaces have been measured morphometrically . Shown in Table 1 are the data of Cullino et al . ( 17 ) for various carcinomas and a sarcoma . These investigators used sodium , chlorine , or D - mannitol as an extracellular marker and dextran 500 ( M , ~ 375 , 000 ) as a vascular marker . [ Note that dextran 500 may overestimate the vascular space due to some 3039 on April 20 , 2017 . © 1987 American Association for Cancer Research . cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from INTERSTITIAL TRANSPORT IN TUMORS Table I Interstitial spaces of tumors HostRatHumanTumorFibrosarcoma 4956VV256carcinomaH5123carcinomaH3683carcinomaNovikofThepatomaNormalliverGastrocnemiusmuscleDS - carcinosarcomaSarcoma - MSarcoma - BSkeletal muscleFibrosarcomaA - MCFibrosarcoma C - MCFibrosarcoma BP - IIMuscleSkinLungKidneyGliomasMeningiomasNormal brainInterstitial space ( % ) 52 . 6Â± 4 . 3Â°36 . 3 Â± 2 . 8 " 43 . 3Â± 1 . 1 " 50 . 6Â± 3 . 5Â°54 . 6 Â± 4 . 4Â°20 . 5 Â± 0 . 6Â°15 . 6 Â±0 . 7Â°38Â»40eSff13C60 Â±555 Â± I3314 Â±234Â±329Â±834Â±620 - 40 * 13 - 15Â»6 - 7 * Ref . 1718192021 ' Interstitial space : mean Â±SD ; tumor weight , ~ 2 - 15 g ; sodium , chlorine , or i > nKinniicilas extracellular marker and dextran 500 as vascular marker . * Extracellular space ; morphometric analysis . * Extracellular space ; tracer , " Cr - EDTA ; measurement made ~ 50 min postin jection . extravasation ( 8 ) . ] The interstitial space of tumors in general is very large , and that of hepatomas is more than twice that of the host liver . Similar results were obtained by Rauen et al . ( 18 ) , Appelgren et al . ( 19 ) , and O ' Connor and Bale ( 20 ) in various sarcomas and by Bakay ( 21 ) in human brain tumors ( Table 1 ) . Although implications of the large interstitial space are not completely understood , it seems reasonable to assume that the large " free - fluid " space would offer less resistance to interstitial transport ( 22 ) . In addition , this large space would serve as a " sink " or a " reservoir " for substances injected into the body ( 2 ) . The large amount of blood - borne substance accumulated in this space may also give an erroneous impression of increased vascular permeability in tumors and / or selective affinity of injected substances for tumor cells . B . Collagen and Elastic Fiber Content Histological examination of tissues using appropriate stains demonstrates the presence of collagenous and elastic fibers . The basic structural unit of the collagenous fibers is the collagen molecule . The main body of this protein molecule has a cylin drical structure ( diameter , ~ 1 . 5 nm ; length , ~ 300 nm ; molec ular weight , ~ 285 , 000 ) and is composed of 3 peptidic a chains ( molecular weight , ~ 95 , 000 ) coiled in a rope - like fashion to form a triple helix . Depending upon the composition of the a chains , the collagen molecules can be divided into at least 10 types ; each type has similar structure and size ( 23 ) . While the collagen fibers offer considerable tensile strength along their length , elastic fibers provide the rubber - like elasticity to a tissue . The structural units of elastic fibers are the microfibrillar pro tein and elastin . The physical and mechanical properties of elastic fibers depend on their amino acid composition ( 14 , IS , 23 ) . Collagen is usually measured by tissue content of hydroxy - proline , since it is assumed that this amino acid occurs almost exclusively in the scleroproteins of the connective tissue ( 24 ) . Collagen content of nine hepatomas , W256 carcinoma , R - 2788 lymphosarcoma , and two fibrosarcomas in rats and two hepa tomas in mice was measured by Cullino et al . ( 24 - 26 ) . All hepatomas contained more collagen than liver did ( Table 2 ) . Unlike regenerating liver , collagen content per unit tissue weight remained constant during growth in eight of nine rat hepatomas . In Hepatoma 5123 , during growth , collagen con tent per unit tissue weight decrease was similar to that for regenerating liver . The results shown in Table 2 do not agree with those of Grabowska ( 27 ) who found a rapid decrease in collagen content of Guerin rat carcinoma and sarcoma as the tumor grew to 1 . 5 g . However , the collagen content per unit weight remained constant between 2 and 30 g tumor weight , Table 2 Collagen content of hepatocarcinomas and liver " Strain / sexHepatocarcinomas * Rat linesSprague - Dawley ( M ) Fisher - 344 ( F ) AxC ( F ) A X C ( F ) Buffalo ( M ) OM ( M ) OM ( F ) OM ( F ) Buffalo ( M ) Mouse linesC3H ( M ) C3H ( M ) C3H ( F ) C3H ( F ) Normal liverRatlinesSprague - Dawley ( M ) Fisher344 ( F ) AxC ( F ) Buffalo ( M ) Sprague - Dawley ( M ) Buffalo ( M ) Tissue denominationNovikoffLC1836833924AT3 - 2HCLC35123129 solid129ascites134solid134ascitesNormalNormalNormalNormal14 days regenerating14daysregeneratingWt ( g ) 4 . 1 Â± 14 . 6Â°2 . 9 Â± 6 . 23 . 3Â± 9 . 02 . 2Â± 7 . 44 . 2 Â±11 . 14 . 0 Â± 7 . 83 . 9Â± 6 . 63 . 5Â± 7 . 83 . 4Â± 9 . 60 . 75 Â± 3 . 60 . 40Â± 1 . 40 . 60 Â±2 . 10 . 60 Â± 1 . 5190 - 210Â° ' 130 - 145180 - 200190 - 210190 - 210190 - 210Hydroxyproline Gig / mg N ) 10 . 9 Â± 0 . 810 . 9Â± 0 . 517 . 4 Â±0 . 630 . 5 Â± 1 . 832 . 4Â± 1 . 242 . 6Â± 2 . 020 . 9Â± 1 . 328 . 1Â± 2 . 036 . 6Â± 2 . 08 . 9 Â± 0 . 519 . 7Â± 1 . 318 . 2Â± 1 . 117 . 3 Â±0 . 88 . 6 Â± 0 . 49 . 0Â± 0 . 28 . 5 Â±0 . 15 . 9 Â± 0 . 25 . 3Â± 0 . 33 . 4Â±0 . 2Collagen ( mg / 100 mg protein ) 1 . 301 . 302 . 063 . 693 . 825 . 042 . 464 . 344 . 341 . 062 . 302 . 162 . 051 . 021 . 061 . 010 . 680 . 630 . 39 Â°From Cullino et al .

Cullino et al . ( 24 ) attributed the initial reduction in collagen content of tumors to the inability of Grabowska ' s technique to separate the small tumor from the collagen - rich s . c . tissue . Cullino and Grantham ( 25 ) demonstrated that the tumor collagen is produced by the host and its synthesis is governed by the tumor cells . These authors also showed that collagen content per unit tumor weight remains constant in all transplant generations regardless of site or age of tumors . If tumor growth depends on collagen production to the extent that it depends on neovascularization , this characteristic of tumors may be exploited in arresting the tumor growth . However , this author is not aware of any such attempts . Unlike collagen , no attempt has been made to quantify the elastic fiber content of tumors . These fibers account for - 2 - 5 % of the dry weight of skin ( 28 ) and - 30 - 60 % of the elastic arteries ( e . g . , aorta ) ( 15 ) . Due to internal structure of collagenous and elastic fibers , these fibers have water space within them which is probably accessible to small molecules and ions ( e . g . , glucose , urea , sodium , and chlorine ) . The water contents of collagenous and elastic fibers are estimated to be - 0 . 6 ml / g collagen and - 0 . 56 ml / ml elastin , respectively ( 15 , 29 , 30 ) . The implication of this space in interstitial transport is not understood . C . Polysaccharides Various in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the stabilized polysaccharide network ( hyaluronate and proteogly - cans ) enmeshed in the collagenous fibers offers considerable resistance to interstitial transport . While the insoluble fibrous proteins ( collagen and elastin ) impart structural integrity to a tissue , the polysaccharides are though to govern the mass transfer characteristics of the tissue due to their high negative charge density and hydrophilic character . The mutual repulsion of negative charges on the chains leads to swelling in solution . In addition , these polysaccharides impart viscoelastic behavior to the interstitium . The viscosity of the polysaccharide solutions depends upon their molecular weight , pH , and binding between hyaluronate and proteoglycans and / or other tissue components . ( For detailed review , see e . g . , Refs . 23 , 31 , and 32 . ) Choi et al . ( 33 ) have reported hyaluronate content of 0 . 018 % in a rat chondrosarcoma . ToÃ³leet al . ( 34 ) reported hyaluronate contents of 0 . 014 and 0 . 028 % in a carcinoma and s . c . tissue of a nude mouse . In contrast , these authors found unusually high content of hyaluronate in V2 carcinoma in rabbits and attrib uted it to its metastatic properties . Fiszer - Szafarz and Cullino ( 35 , 36 ) studied the relationship between HA2 and hyaluroni - dase in the interstitial fluids of tumor and the s . c . tissue ( TIF and SIF , respectively ) . They found HA concentration of SIF to be 53 . 5 Mg / ml fluid in the scapular region , but only 37 . 2 ng / m \ in the lumbar region . In W256 carcinoma HA concentration was 38 Mg / ml when grown in the scapular region and 20 Mg / ml when grown in the lumbar region . Further , the concentration of HA was - 25 % lower in s . c . areas distant from the tumor . These investigators attributed the low HA concentration in tumors to the concomitant elevated TIF hyaluronidase activity , which was - 57 % higher in TIF than in SIF . The increased hyaluronidase activity may make tumors a source of polysac - 1The abbreviations used are : HA , hyaluronic acid ; GAG , glycosaminoglycans ; MP , micropipet technique ; TIF , SIF , NIF , tumor , s . c . , and normal interstitial fluid , respectively ; IFP , interstitial fluid pressure ; TIFP , SIFP , pressure of TIF and SIF , respectively ; BSA , bovine serum albumin ; WIN , wick - in - needle tech nique ; IF , interstitial fluid ; 0 , value in water . charide fragments and may ultimately affect the immune re sponse of the host ( 16 ) . The data on HA bound to the collagen matrix in tumors are not available . Unlike hyaluronate , the data on the proteoglycans ( GAG ) content of tumors are limited . Boas ( 37 ) and Pearce ( 38 ) found hexosamine content in mouse s . c . tissue to be â€”0 . 18 % and - 0 . 14 % , respectively . Brada ( 39 ) measured it to be - 0 . 027 % in both Ehrlich and Krebs tumors in mouse . In contrast , Sylven ( 40 ) found relatively high GAG content in various sarcomas ( 0 . 1 - 1 . 5 % ) . Since in Sylven ' s investigations GAG content was measured in the fluid collected by blunt dissection and forma tion of small pouches in the tissues , the validity of results depends upon the extent of damage done to the tissue / cells . Due to the importance of these macromolecules in the solute and fluid transport in tumors , a definite need exists to measure their concentrations in various tumor types . D . Composition of Tumor Interstitial Fluid Methods . The results on interstitial fluid composition are controversial due to the methodological problems as well as the heterogeneity in the interstitium . Most commonly used meth ods include : direct sampling using needle ( catheter ) or micro pipet ; implanted wicks ; and chronically implanted micropore chamber ( or perforated capsule ) technique . [ All of these tech niques were originally developed for interstitial pressure meas urements ( see Section 111A ) . ] The major problem with the direct sampling method is the cellular and vascular damage caused by puncturing the tissue ; as a result the fluid collected may be a mixture of cellular and pericellular fluids . Although micropipets may reduce this damage , one is not sure whether the fluid withdrawn represents the free - fluid phase or the gel phase . Furthermore , the applied suction may increase net capillary filtration and lower interstitial fluid concentration . The major objection to the wick technique is that it may act as a colloid osmometer . Finally , the major objections to the chamber / cap sule procedure are : ( a ) the chamber may influence the structure of the surrounding tissue ; and ( b ) the chamber fluid may not represent interstitial fluid due to hindered transport across the micropore membrane or the surrounding connective tissue layer . Cullino Ã©tal . ( 41 ) presented the following data in support of the use of their chamber for TIF measurement : ( a ) the pore size ( 0 . 45 / JIN ) is large compared to the molecules present in the TIF ; ( Â¿ > ) samples collected outside and inside a chamber immersed in plasma have identical compositions ; ( < â€¢ ) when two chambers are placed close to each other in a s . c . pouch or a tumor , proteins with enzymatic activity placed in one chamber can be found in the other chamber ; and ( d ) histolÃ³gica ! exam ination shows neoplastic cells touching the chamber ( 16 , 42 , 43 ) . There are three problems with this chamber which should be kept in mind : ( a ) implant of the chamber in the s . c . area leads to lactic acid production from glucose in - 1 week to - 1 month and formation of a fibrosarcoma in - 1 year ; ( b ) it takes several days to fill up the chamber and hence it has a slow dynamic response ; and ( < â€¢ ) the ability of this chamber to measure the exchange of macromolecules has not been tested independ ently , especially in light of hindered diffusion offered by the connective tissue layer around the chamber . Other procedures for sampling the interstitial fluid include : ( a ) sampling the lymph fluid [ Note that the equality between interstitial free fluid and lymph is still unresolved ( 15 ) . ] ; ( Â¿ > ) determination of solute concentration in excised tissues ; ( c ) intravital fluorescent microscopy ; and ( d ) exchange kinetics of radiolabeled solutes .

' Mean Â±SD . of these techniques are discussed by Aukland and Nicolaysen ( 12 ) . Results . According to Starling ' s hypothesis , the driving force for transcapillary exchange of fluid is the difference between intra - and extravascular hydrostatic and osmotic pressures . Because of their low reflection coefficient and high permeabil ity , most low molecular weight solutes do not contribute signif icantly to the osmotic pressure gradients , at least at steady state . Concentrations of various low molecular weight solutes ( e . g . , ions , nutrients , waste products , and enzymes ) have been mea sured by Cullino et al . ( 41 , 42 ) in TIP , SIF , and plasma and are summarized in Table 3 . TIP has high H + , CO2 , and lactic acid concentrations and low glucose and O2 concentrations as compared to SIF . The differences in the concentrations of H + , CO2 , glucose , lactic acid , cholesterol , lipid phosphorus content , and free amino acids between plasma and TIF are significant , perhaps due to tumor metabolism ( see also Ref . 45 ) . Based on the invasive characteristics and presence of necrotic areas in tumors , it is generally assumed that TIF has high levels of proteolytic and lysosomal enzyme activities . The experimen tal data on this subject are inconclusive . Sylven et al . ( 46 - 49 ) , using the direct sampling method , have shown increased lyso somal and proteolytic activity in TIF , especially in necrotic areas . Cullino and Lanzerotti ( 50 ) have also reported increased activity of six lysosomal enzymes during mammary tumor regression ( which involves digestion of dead cells similar to necrosis ) ; however , they found the increase in activity in the cells and not in the pericellular fluid , either before or during regression . In a separate study , Fiszer - Szafarz and Cullino ( 36 ) did report increased activity of hyaluronidase in TIF . The results on the protein concentration in TIF are as con troversial as in the NIF . Based on high effective vascular permeability and effective interstitial diffusion coefficient in tumors ( 8 ) one would expect higher concentrations of plasma proteins in TIF than in NIF . In support of this hypothesis are the data oi Sylven and Bois ( 47 ) who , using the direct sampling method , found TIF and SIF concentrations , respectively , - 67 - 97 % and - 30 - 50 % of the plasma concentration ( TIF , - 3 . 9 - 5 . 7 g / 100 ml ; NIF , - 2 . 8 g / 100 ml ) ( see also Ref . 51 ) . On the other hand , using the chamber method Cullino et al . ( 41 ) found opposite results ( Table 3 ) . These results are surprising espe cially because extravascular deposition of fibrin is a prominent feature of neoplasia ( 52 ) . Since a major fraction of the body ' s plasma proteins is found in the extravascular compartment and their concentrations in plasma and interstitial space govern transcapillary exchange , more work is needed on the composi tion of interstitial fluid for both normal and neoplastic tissues . III . Interstitial Fluid Pressure and Flow in Tumors LymphaticVesselt1 | 1tArterial EndInterstitBloodal SpaceVessel â€¢ - l11VenouEnd The schematic shown in Fig . 1 depicts the current concept of fluid and solute movement in the interstitium of a normal Fig . 1 . Schematic of solute and fluid movement in the normal interstitial space . Solute refers to macromolecules and fluid refers to dilute solution of small hydrophilic molecules in water . Note that transcapillary nitration and reabsorp - tion of fluid depend upon the hydraulic and osmotic pressure differences between intravascular and extravascular spaces , per Starling ' s hypothesis . The small amount of fluid which is not reabsorbed is collected by the lymphatic vessels . Movement of fluid through the interstitium and into the lymphatic vessels results from relatively small shifts in hydraulic and osmotic pressure gradients . Move ment of macromolecules is due to diffusion as well as convection associated with fluid motion . Since anatomically well - defined , functioning lymphatic vessels may be absent in a neoplastic tissue , the excess fluid and macromolecules ooze out of the tumor and may be collected by the lymphatic vessels of the surrounding normal tissue . tissue . According to the hypothesis of Starling ( 53 ) , fluid move ment across the vessel wall is governed by the transcapillary hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients . Most of the fluid filtered into the interstitial space is reabsorbed into the micro - vascular network by the Starling mechanism . The residual fluid is taken up by the lymphatic vessels . Since tumors may not have anatomically well - defined lymphatic vessels , this residual fluid may ooze out of the tumor periphery and may be reab sorbed by the lymphatics of the surrounding normal tissue thus aiding lymphatic dissemination of cancer cells . If the fluid reabsorption is not rapid enough and / or tumor cells continue to proliferate , the pressure in the interstitial space may increase . This elevated pressure may lead to vascular occlusion and ultimately necrosis and / or may facilitate intravasation and ul timately vascular dissemination of cancer cells . The objective of this section is to address these issues by examining the available data on the interstitial pressure and fluid flow in tumors . ( The implications of fluid flow in the solute transport are discussed in Section IV . ) A . Interstitial Pressure in Tumors Methods . Currently , there are three methods to measure local interstitial pressure , ( a ) needle , ( b ) WIN and ( c ) MP , and one method to measure average interstitial pressure , micropore chamber , also referred to as the perforated capsule method . Each of these methods has its advantages and limitations ( see , e . g . , Refs . 54 and 55 for detailed comparison ) .

The pressure at this point is considered to be equal to the interstitial fluid pressure . In the wick - in - needle technique , a wick made of polyester or other fibers is placed in the needle to provide a large surface area continuum with the interstitium and to reduce occlusion . Both needle and WIN methods can cause tissue distortion and trauma . Fluid injection in the needle technique may increase interstitial pressure . The fibrous wick may act as a colloid osmometer in the WIN technique in chronic measurements . Micropipets , 1 - 3 urn in diameter , connected to a servo - null pressure - measuring system reduce the problems of needle and WIN techniques considerably . Most investigators have not been able to use this method for depths greater than 800 / Â¿mdue to pipet breakage . We have been able to overcome this problem by choosing suitable glass capillaries to make pipÃ©is . ' The micropore chamber technique was introduced at about the same time independently by Guyton ( 56 ) and Cullino et al . ( 41 ) to sample the interstitial fluid of normal and tumor tissues , respectively . In this method , the chamber must be implanted in the tissue days in advance so that it is filled up with the interstitial fluid by the time of measurement . As a result , this method cannot be used for dynamic measurements . In addition , the connective tissue surrounding the chamber may act as a semipermeable membrane , excluding large molecules from the chamber fluid and consequently introducing osmotic effects . Cullino ( 43 ) has carefully examined several of these effects in his studies of tumor pathophysiology and found them to be negligible . ( See Section HD . ) Results . Young et al . ( 57 ) were the first investigators to measure TIFP and found it to be higher than IFF in the normal host tissue . Since that time IFF has been measured in several 3M . Misiewicz and R . K Jain . Interstitial pressure gradients in VX2 carci noma , manuscript in preparation . animal tumors using all four techniques ( Table 4 ) and the results agree with Young ' s findings ( 58 - 63 ) . The increased value of TIFF has been attributed to the absence of a well - defined lymphatic system in the tumor ( 58 ) and to increased permea bility of tumor vessels ( 8 ) . Young et al . ( 57 ) , Wiig et al . ( 60 ) , Paskins - Hurlburt et al . ( 59 ) , Hori et al . ( 63 ) , and Misiewicz and Jain3 have examined the intratumor pressure as a function of tumor size . All these investigators found that as the tumor size increases , TIFF rises , presumably due to the proliferation of tumor cells in a confined area as well as high vascular permeability and possible absence of functioning lymphatic vessels in tumors . This increase in TIFF also correlates with reduction in tumor blood flow and development of necrosis in a growing tumor ( 9 , 59 , 60 , 63 ) . ' Wiig et al . ( 60 ) attributed the rise in TIFF to ischemie cell swelling as well . Wiig et al . ( 60 ) and Misiewicz and Jain3 have also examined the intratumor pressure gradients . Using the WIN technique , Wiig et al . ( 60 ) found that in tumors < 2 . 5 g , pressure in the outer one - third of the tumor is 6 . 0 Â±1 . 7 ( S . D . ) mm Hg and in the central one - third it is 11 . 4 Â±4 . 1 mm Hg , whereas in tumors > 5 . 5 g , the values in these regions are 9 . 6 Â±3 . 5 and 16 . 0 Â±4 . 8 mm Hg , respectively . The highest TIFF measured was + 23 . 3 mm Hg in the central region of a tumor > 5 . 5 g . Using the MP technique , these authors found TIFF equal to 2 . 4 Â±2 . 4 mm Hg in the superficial layer ( < 800 urn ) of small as well is large tumors . Our results using the MP technique for the entire tumor are in general agreement with tiiose of Wiig et al . ( 60 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . A limited number of investigators have attempted to modify TIFP with physical and chemical means . For example , Young et al . ( 57 ) reported that IFF in both normal and neoplastic tissues increases by injection of fluid ( 0 . 5 ml ) into the tissue and by the application of digital compression . This fact should be kept in mind during the diagnosis and treatment of human 3043 on April 20 , 2017 . © 1987 American Association for Cancer Research . cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from INTERSTITIAL TRANSPORT IN TUMORS 10 Tumor 3 V ~ 1 . 87cm5 State ~ Necrotic Tumor 2 V ~ 026 cm ' State ~ Viable Tumor 1 V - 0 . 07 cm * State Â»Viable Subcut Outer 1 / 3 Middle 1 / 3 Central 1 / 3 Fig . 2 .

From Misiewicz and Jain . 3 tumors , e . g . , palpation , especially if repeated or applied injudi ciously ; aspiration biopsy ; and the local injection of anesthetics or other pharmacological agents . Similarly , Wiig and Gadeholt ( 62 ) were able to increase TIFP by increasing the venous pressure ( which also resulted in skin and tumor blood flow reduction ) and by plasma volume expansion with 5 % BSA solution ( which also resulted in skin and tumor blood flow increase ) . Finally , Tveit et al . ( 61 ) reported a decrease in the IFF of dimethylbenzenthracene - induced mammary carcinoma in rats from 10 . 3 Â±1 . 3 mm Hg to 7 . 0 Â±1 . 1 mm Hg during noradrenaline infusion . This agent , which is a potent vasocon strictor , increased the systemic pressure by 30 - 40 mm Hg and decreased tumor blood flow . These studies do not support the hypothesis that reduction in tumor blood flow is a result of increased TIFP . Whatever the key factor or factors for the increase in TIFP are , absence of functioning lymphatic vessels , increased perme ability to macromolecules , tumor cell proliferation in a rela tively rigid area , or ischemie cell swelling , the elevated TIFP has profound implications in tumor growth , detection , and treatment . For example , increased TIFP may facilitate the entrance of cancer cells into tumor blood vessels or into the surrounding normal tissue lymphatics , thereby aiding the met astatic process . Increased TIFP may reduce the Starling forces responsible for extravasation of fluid and various solutes , e . g . , cytotoxic agents , monoclonal antibodies , biological response modifiers , making it difficult to deliver these detection / treat ment agents to large tumors . Increased TIFP may also hinder extravasation of leukocytes involved in immune response . All these effects are also influenced by the microvascular pressure in tumors which has been found to be low compared to that in the host tissue ( 64 ) . B . Interstitial Fluid Flow in Tumors Methods . Increased pressure gradients in the tumor intersti - tium suggest the existence of significant convection in the tumor interstitium . To measure this fluid flow , Butler et al . ( 58 ) utilized two methods : ( a ) comparison of erythrocyte concentra tion ( hematocrit ) of tumor afferent and efferent blood in a tissue isolated preparation where tumor is connected to the host by a single artery and a single vein ( 43 ) ; and ( b ) continuous drainage of the interstitial fluid from micropore chambers em bedded in normal and neoplastic tissues ( 43 ) . Note that both of these methods provide values of " net " interstitial flow ( as measured by fluid loss ) , and not of the local convective velocity of the fluid . The latter has not been mea sured for normal or neoplastic tissues to date . ( See Section IVA for a novel method of measuring convective velocity of a solute . ) Results . Hemoconcentration measurements by Butler et al . ( 58 ) show that in four different mammary carcinomas , 2 - 5 g , the fluid loss , QtF , to the interstitial compartment is ~ 0 . 14 - 0 . 22 ml / h / g tissue ( Table 5 ) . This is approximately 5 - 10 % of plasma flow rate through these tumors and significantly more than the lymph drainage in most normal tissues [ 0 . 0017 - 0 . 072 ml / h / g ( 12 ) ] . The oozing out of this fluid from tumors may be responsible for the peritumor edema often seen in s . c . tumor implants and may play a role in the production of lymphatic metastasis . Although the direction and magnitude of these convective currents were not measured by these investigators , their results explain the observations of Reinhold ( 65 ) who found the spread of pyranine dye in tumor interstitium at rates faster than predictable by diffusion alone ( 66 ) . Although convective flow depends on the pressure gradients and hydraulic conductivity of the medium ( see Equation A ) , these authors found a significant correlation between Q , , and tumor blood flow rate per unit mass . Since tumor blood flow rate per unit mass decreases as a tumor grows ( for review , see Ref . 9 ) , QIF was found to be proportionately less for large tumors . It is worth noting here that these investigators found no difference in QIF in growing versus regressing hormone - dependent tumors ( 58 ) . Continuous drainage of interstitial fluid from micropore chambers showed that tumors oozed out ~ 4 - 5 times more fluid than the s . c . tissue ( ~ 3 . 5 - 4 . 75 ml / day versus ~ 0 . 9 ml / day ) . Furthermore , the fluid drained from tumors in ml / day remained fairly constant as the tumor grew from 2 g to 26 . 5 g in 5 days ( 58 ) . C . Theoretical Studies of Interstitial Pressure - Flow Relations As discussed in Section II , the interstitial space is considered to have two compartments , the colloid - rich gel space containing the hydrophilic hyaluronate and proteoglycans at or near equi librium with the colloid - poor , free - fluid space . In this model , the gel phase is considered to be immobilized , although the possibility of mobile hyaluronate cannot be excluded ( 35 , 36 , 67 ) . In addition , whether these two compartments are arranged in series or in parallel is not known ( 15 ) . Finally , although preferential fluid channels and rivulets have been reported in the interstitial space by Nakamura and Wayland ( 68 ) and Casley - Smith ( 69 ) , to date no direct measurements of fluid velocity in the interstitium have been made . To this end , a limited number of investigators ( e . g . , ReÃ s . 70 - 72 ) have com puted velocity and pressure profiles around single and multiple capillaries using Dairy ' s law for flow through a porous medium : ( A ) where u is the fluid velocity , p is the pressure , and A , is the Table 5 Interstitial fluid loss in mammary tumors " Tumor MTW9 * DMBA NMU W256 Wt ( g ) ( mean Â±SE ) 4 . 3 Â±0 . 9 3 . 8 Â±1 . 0 2 . 3 Â±0 . 4 3 . 9 Â±0 . 6 Hc ( mean Â±SE ) 1 . 042 Â±0 . 006 1 . 068 Â±0 . 011 1 . 051 Â±0 . 013 1 . 029 Â±0 . 007 IF lossml / hr / gc 0 . 22 0 . 19 0 . 14 0 . 18 % blood perfused 4 . 2 5 . 1 2 . 7 6 . 7 % plasma perfused 6 . 5 8 . 5 4 . 5 10 . 2 " Data from Butler et al .

( See Section IV for measurements and values of K . ) These theoretical analyses show large pressure gradients near the capillary wall which die out at distances beyond a few capillary diameters ( 71 ) . [ Note that in addition to small scale pressure gradients around individual capillaries , large scale pressure gradients exist in tumors from its center to the periphery ( Fig . 2 ) . The relationship between these two pressure gradients has not been studied theoretically or exper imentally . ] These analyses also point out that the convective transport patterns in the interstitium are quite sensitive to intravascular pressures and intercapillary interactions ( 72 ) . It must be mentioned here that these authors in their models assume fluid filtration and reabsorption to occur at the arterial and venous ends of capillaries , respectively . Zweifach and I i powsky ( 73 ) on the other hand propose that Filtration and absorption are also temporal ( periodic ) processes not just spa tial ones . The basis of their conjecture is that under normal conditions the interstitial colloid osmotic pressure is ~ 8 - 10 mm Hg and the interstitial hydraulic pressure is ~ 0 mm Hg . Direct pressure measurements suggest that the pressure drop across a 600 - 1200 - fim path from pa - capillary to post capillary is ~ 3 - 5 mm Hg . On the other hand , presumably due to arterial vasomotion , the pressure in capillaries fluctuates from as low as 10 - 15 mm Hg during near stasis to as high as 20 - 25 mm Hg above blood colloid osmotic pressure during maximal flow . Experimental measurement of fluid velocity in the interstitium is now needed to resolve the temporal and spatial contributions to the fluid flow . IV . Transport Parameters Characterizing Interstitial Diffusion and Convection in Tumors Transport of molecules in the interstitium is due to concen tration gradients ( diffusion ) and the motion of interstitial fluid ( convection ) . For one - dimensional transport , the diffusive flux , J , , , of a solute in a medium is given by Fick ' s law : dC ( B ) where I ) is the diffusion coefficient of the solute in the medium , and dC / dx is the concentration gradient of solute ( C is concen tration and x is position or distance coordinate ) . Similarly , the convective flux , Jâ€žis given by : Jc = CRpU = - CRfK - r ( Q where u is the convective flow velocity of the solvent resulting from pressure gradients in the medium ( see Equation A ) , RF is the retardation factor ( solute convective velocity / solvent con vective velocity ) , A is the tissue hydraulic conductivity for convective flow of solvent through the medium ( k / rÂ¡ , where k is Darcy ' s constant , and r , is solvent viscosity ) and dp / dx is the pressure gradient ( p - hydrostatic pressure ) . The convective and diffusive transport may be in the same direction or in opposite directions depending upon the pressure and concentration gra dients . In what follows we will present published values of each of the transport coefficients , D , K , and RF , for the normal and tumor interstitium . The pressure gradients and convective fluid flow in the tumor interstitium were discussed in Section III . A . Interstitial Diffusion Coefficients Methods . Various methods of measuring diffusion coeffi cients in a ( liquid ) medium are summarized by Cussler ( 74 ) . Most methods require measuring solute flux at a known con centration gradient or measuring relaxation of concentration gradients as a function of time in the medium and then fitting the steady or the unsteady state diffusion equation to the concentration data to extract the diffusion coefficient . Due to the difficulties involved in measuring the concentra tion gradients in the interstitial space in vivo , most diffusion measurements to date have been carried out in tissue slices / " / / vitro or in various gels / solutions as a model of the interstitium . Only recently have the developments in quantitative fluorescent microscopy allowed measurements of the effective interstitial diffusion coefficients in vivo ( 12 , 22 , 68 , 75 - 81 ) . There are three major problems with the intravital fluorescent microscopy methods : ( a ) these methods can be used only for thin tissues or for the superficial layer of thick tissues ; ( b ) the effective diffu sion coefficients include both diffusive and convective compo nents ; and ( c ) several biologically useful molecules , e . g . , ( ) . . ( ' ( ) , , are not fluorescent , and their molecular weight is less than that of currently available fluorescent tags . The first problem has been addressed by Goldstein et al . ( 82 ) who monitored transport in tumors using fiber optic microfluorometry ; how ever , poor spatial resolution and fluorescence quenching do not permit one to extract diffusion coefficient from their approach . Regarding the second problem , we have recently proposed the use of fluorescent recovery after photobleaching to discriminate interstitial convection from diffusion in vivo ( 83 ) . In this method , which is used routinely by cell biologists , a well - defined concentration gradient of a fluorescent tracer is artificially imposed in the extravascular region of a tissue by photobleach ing with a laser beam . The relaxation of the concentration profile is monitored and analyzed to yield the diffusion coeffi cient and the convective velocity ( 83 , 84 ) . When the diffusing species ( e . g . , O2 , CO2 , antibodies ) binds to or reacts with any component of the tissue , the estimation of its diffusion coefficient becomes even more complex . If reaction and binding are not properly accounted for , the values of diffusion coefficients may be incorrect . One solution to this problem is to study transport of a nonreacting species which is similar in size , structure , charge , and configuration to the species in question . Results . Effect of Tissue Water Content . Vaupel ( 51 ) has recently compiled the tissue diffusion coefficients of various small molecular weight species : O2 , CO2 , N2 , H2 , glucose , and inulin ( Table 6 ; Refs . 66 and 85 - 91 ) . All D values presented were corrected to 37Â°C ( 310Â°K ) by the following correlation based on the Stokes - Einstein equation ( 74 ) : / > 3 , o = Dr - 3 * - - Table 6 Diffusion coefficient of glucose and inulin ( cnf / s ) ( D ) TissueConnective tissue mem braneHumanaorta - intimamediaHuman articular ian ilanalÃ¤ge SalineBrainPlasmaAny tissue * DS - carcinosarcomaTissue slicesAscitescellsGlucose2x 10 - * 1 . 7 x 10 - * 1 . 3 x IO - 62 . 2 x IO - 69x 10 - * 6 . 7 x IO ' 78 . 75x 10 - * 3 . 6 x 10 - * 2 . 6 x 10 - * 4 . 3 x 10 - * Inulin Ref .

The subscripts of D and TJrefer to the temperature in " K . Vaupel found that the diffusion coefficients of small solutes ( O2 , CO2 , N2 , and H2 ) decreased exponentially with the percentage of water content , z , of the tissue : D = a exp ( - Ã©z ) ( E ) These results are not surprising since the polysaccharide net work composed of hyaluronate and proteoglycans dispersed in the interstitial collagen and elastic fibers offers little resistance to these gaseous molecules . For larger molecules , however , hydrodynamic and steric interactions with the solute may be as important as or more important than the water content ( see below ) . Molecular Weight Dependence . Diffusion coefficients of mac - romolecules , primarily dextrans , in water and in normal tissues have been measured by several investigators and can be de scribed by the power law expression ( 92 ) D = a ( M , Y ( F ) The coefficients a and b for water and various tissues are summarized in Table 7 . Note that the value of the exponent , b , is ~ 0 . 5 for water and ranges from ~ 0 . 75 to ~ 3 for various tissues , suggesting that the dependence of the diffusion coeffi cients on molecular weight in tissues deviates from that for free diffusion in water . These results are consistent with the hypoth esis that hydrodynamic and steric interactions among the sol ute , solvent , and the interstitial matrix determine the transport properties of a solute in tissues , and not just the water content . Despite rapid progress in this field , there is a paucity of interstitial diffusion data in tumors . Nugent and Jain ( 22 ) and Gerlowski and Jain ( 80 ) obtained the effective interstitial dif fusion coefficients of various dextrans and albumin in VX2 carcinoma in vivo ( Fig . 3 ) . Note that the macromolecular trans port in this tumor is hindered to a lesser extent than in nontu - morous ( mature granulation ) tissue . Whether this significant difference is solely due to the physicochemical characteristics of the interstitial matrix of these tissues or due to increased interstitial convection needs to be answered ( see below ) . What ever the cause of this difference is , it favors the use of macro - molecules in cancer detection and treatment ( 8 , 93 ) . Similar studies in various animal and human tumors are needed to exploit monoclonal antibodies and drug - macromolecule con jugates optimally in the management of neoplastic diseases . Dependence on Configuration , Charge , and Binding . Since dextrans are linear molecules and albumin is a globular mole cule , it is more reasonable to compare their transport properties on the basis of their molecular size than their weight . Usually the Stokes - Einstein radius , a , . of a molecule is chosen as a measure of its size ( 92 ) : k / 6rrÂ¡D0 ( G ) where k is the Boltzmann constant , and Da is the free diffusion coefficient of the molecules in water at absolute temperature T and viscosity y . Shown in Fig . 4 are ratios of effective diffusion coefficient to free diffusion coefficient ( D / D0 ) for sodium fluorescein , BSA , and dextrans versus their Stokes - Einstein radii ( 94 ) . Note that in both normal and neoplastic tissues BSA diffusion is signifi cantly lower than that of a dextran of the equivalent Stokes - Einstein radius . This effect has been observed in several normal tissues ; however , no effects of this nature have been reported for diffusion in tumors by other investigators . For example , Fox and Wayland ( 77 ) found diffusive transport of BSA in the rat mesentery to be hindered more than dextrans of the same molecular size . The deviation of diffusion coefficients from a strict molecular size basis could be explained in terms of configuration , charge , and binding of the test molecule . The dextrans used in our study are linear polymers with a slight degree of branching ( 5 % ) , and the albumin molecule is loosely coiled in an ellipso idal shape in aqueous solution ( 92 , 95 ) . Various in vitro and in vivo studies have shown greater transport rates of linear mole cules than that of globular molecules of equivalent Stokes - Einstein radius ( 96 - 98 ) . Electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged albumin by neg ative charges of the interstitial matrix would lead to a smaller effective volume for diffusion . Works by various investigators on capillary permeability to charged proteins support this hy pothesis as reviewed previously ( 99 , 100 ) . The reduction in D has been related to the fixed charge density of matrix by Maroudas ( 87 ) . Similarly , the effects of electrochemical poten tial on interstitial transport in connective tissues have been reviewed by Grodzinsky ( 101 ) . Finally , binding of BSA to the tissue components could further reduce the diffusivity of albumin . However , Rutili ( 102 ) found no measurable binding between dextrans and proteins , in vivo . The precise role of configuration , charge , and binding in macromolecular diffusion still needs to be determined for normal or neoplastic tissue . Pore and Fiber - Matrix Models . The differences between nor mal and neoplastic tissue diffusion coefficients were related to the size of the solute molecules and to the physicochemical properties of the interstitial matrix of these tissues using a pore model and a fiber - matrix model ( 94 , 103 ) . It must be pointed out here that there is little evidence based on electron micro graphs that well - defined pores or fiber - matrix structures exist in the interstitial space . However , these two models provide an empirical framework within which to examine the transport relationships of different solutes and to obtain some important and useful correlations .

When the interstitial matrix of a tissue is modeled as a circular cylindrical pore of radius / â€¢ , , . pore radii of 6 and 16 nm , respectively , describe the dextran data in normal and neoplastic tissues adequately . Considerably smaller pore radii ( 4 nm for normal and 6 nm for neoplastic ) are required to account for the restriction of BSA ( Fig . 4 ) . When the tissue interstitial space is modeled as a random matrix of straight fibers of radius rf , fiber concentrations CF of 20 and 0 . 6 % , respectively , account for restriction of dextran by normal and neoplastic tissues . Considerably higher values of CF ( ~ 40 % for normal and ~ 20 % for neoplastic ) are required to explain the BSA data ( Fig . 4 ) . It is of interest to note here that Fox and Wayland ( 77 ) calculated the values of CF to be 6 to 28 % to explain their diffusion data for dextran and albumin in the mesentery . Our results show that the granulation tissue of the rabbit ear offers a greater restriction to molecular transport than the mesentery . Although the fiber matrix model is in qualitative agreement with the data , values of CT are consider ably higher compared to measured values of HA . It is possible that collagen fibers also offer resistance to the solute transport ( 104 ) . Further work is now needed to improve these models to predict diffusion coefficient in tissues based on physicochemical characteristics of solute - tissue system . B . Hydraulic Conductivity and Retardation Factor Methods . Hydraulic conductivity of tissues is normally ob tained by applying Darcy ' s law to in vitro filtration data . In these experiments , flow rate , ( J . of fluid is measured across a tissue slice of thickness A . r and cross - sectional area / * for known applied pressure difference , Ap , across the tissue . For steady flow the hydraulic conductivity , K , is given by K = ( Q / A ) ( Ap / Ax ) ( H ) Extreme care must be exercised during excising , slicing , and holding ( clamping ) to avoid tissue compression and damage . Measurement of interstitial K in vivo is extremely difficult . Swabb et ai ( 66 ) have measured A of s . c . tissue and Hepatoma 5123 in the rat . In these experiments , pressure is suddenly decreased in a micropore chamber placed in the interstitial space , and the resulting flow of interstitial fluid into the cham ber is measured as a function of time . The unsteady state analysis of these data provides the pressure diffusivity , E , which is equal to K / a0 . ( Here K is the hydraulic conductivity , a is the interstitial space compressibility , and 6 is the interstitial space volume fraction . ) For details , see the paper of Swabb et al . ( 66 ) . The retardation factor , K , . is normally determined from ultracentrifuge experiments by measuring the ratio of the sedi mentation coefficient of solute in the desired medium to that in physiological saline solution . The interstitial fluid is usually simulated by hyaluronic acid or proteoglycan solutions ( 105 ) . Results . Hydraulic Conductivity . Hydraulic conductivity , K , of a tissue , similar to that of a porous bed , should depend on tissue interstitial space volume fraction , cell diameter , and architecture of the interstitial matrix . In the absence of data on these parameters , Swabb et al . ( 66 ) proposed the following correlation to describe the in vitro values of K for various tissues in terms of their glycosaminoglycan concentration , CGAG ( g / 100 g tissue ) : K = 4 . 6 x ( I ) These authors estimated tissue GAG content as twice published values of hexosamine content for normal tissues , and 0 . 01 - 0 . 05 g / 100 g for Hepatoma 5123 based on the liver content of 0 . 088 g / 100g . Support for this correlation comes from the qualitative stud ies of Day ( 106 , 107 ) and Hedbys ( 108 ) who showed an increase in flow across mouse fascia and cornea , respectively , due to the application of hyaluronidase . Similarly , Maroudas ( 109 ) found a decrease in tf with increasing fixed charge density of articular cartilage . Note that the fixed charge density is related to GAGs . [ For more details on the role of polysaccharides on fluid flow , see the reviews by Fatt ( 110 ) and Granger ( 111 ) . ] Contrary to the above hypothesis , Jackson and James ( 112 ) found that hyaluronate accounts for only part of the flow resistance . Levick ( 104 ) proposes that collagen fibrils can con tribute significantly to the interstitial resistance due to their volume occupancy and net surface area . The water content , z , of tissue has been also related to its hydraulic conductivity ( 109 - 111 ) . Perhaps one of the most comprehensive power law 3047 on April 20 , 2017 . © 1987 American Association for Cancer Research . cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from INTERSTITIAL TRANSPORT IN TUMORS correlations between K and z was developed by Bert and Fatt ( 113 ) , which fits K data over 9 orders of magnitude . K = az * ( J ) This dependence of K on water content means that during in vitro or in vivo experiments water content of a tissue may change due to applied pressure and may lead to erroneous results . In this context it is worth noting that K for dog s . c . tissue was found to be about 2 orders of magnitude higher by Guyton et al . ( 114 ) than that for rat s . c . tissue found by Swabb et al . ( 66 ) . ( 1 . 8 x IO " 9 versus 6 . 4 x 10 ~ ' 2 cm4 / dyn . s ) . Similarly , Swabb et al . ( 66 ) found K for Hepatoma 5123 about 1 order of magnitude higher in vitro than in vivo ( 31 x IO " 12versus 2 . 9 - 8 . 4 x 10 ~ 12 ) . More in vitro and in vivostudies are needed to resolve the effect of tissue composition on A . Retardation Factor . The relative velocity of a solute with respect to the solvent velocity , RF , has been studied extensively in model and biological membranes , both experimentally and theoretically ( see , e . g . , Ref . 115 ) . There is a paucity of such studies for tissues . The data of Laurent and Pietruszkiewicz ( 105 ) on RF in HA solution were described by Swabb et al . ( 66 ) by the equation / RF = 1 . 5 exp [ - 8 . 64 x irr3 ( Mf 3t * ( CHA ) Â° - 5 ] ( K ) for 6 . 9 x 10 " < M , < 2 . 8 x IO9 and 0 < CHA < 0 . 35 g / 100 g solution . By assuming that tissue has the same retardation properties as the HA solutions , Swabb et al . ( 66 ) proposed the following empirical correlation after correcting for the interstitial space fraction ( 0 . 43 ) : RF = 1 . 5 exp [ - 1 . 318 x 10 - ' ( A / r ) 0366 ( CcAG ) 05 ] ( L ) where CGAGranges from 0 to 0 . 813 g GAG / 100 g tissue . More rigorous experimental and theoretical studies along these lines are needed to improve our understanding of convec tive transport of solute in the interstitium . C . Ratio of Convection versus Diffusion in the Interstitium Despite overwhelming evidence for significant interstitial convection in normal and neoplastic tissues , there is no direct measurement of the magnitude and direction of convective velocity of a solute or solvent in the interstitium ( see Section III ) . In the absence of such hard data one can only hypothesize about the relative contribution of convection to the interstitial transport . For one dimensional transport , using Equations B and C , one can obtain X = Diffusive flux D AC _ ) _ Convective flux RF * C Ap ( M ) in which Xis JD / JC ( flux ratio ) . To obtain an order of magnitude of X , Swabb et al . ( 66 ) assumed AC / C ~ 1 and Ap - 30 mm Hg and simplified Equation M to X = 2 . 5 x IO ' 5 D / RfK ( N ) Using the empirical correlations for D ( Table 7 ) , K ( Equation I ) , and RF ( Equation L ) , these authors estimated diffusion to convection ratios for solutes of given molecular weights moving through tissues with known GAG content ( Fig . 5 ) . Note that the transport of low molecular weight substances is diffusion dominated while convection becomes important at higher mo lecular weights . / f II $ ' / â€¢Retorded transport0KR > < 0 . 9 - Herpes ( mommaI ) .

Importance of diffusive and convective mass transport in the extravas - cular space of normal and neoplastic tissue at 37 - 38 * C . The parameter \ is the ratio of solute diffusive flux to convective flux . The position of the lines of constant X is determined by choosing Ac / ( cA / > ) = 1 / ( 30 mm Hg ) , where c is extravascular solute concentration and p is interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure . The retardation factor K , is the solute convective flow velocity / solvent convective flow velocity for flow through a polysaccharide network . Published data validating the analysis are : â€¢ , mouse mammary adenocarcinoma BICR / SA1 and human bronchial carcinoma ( 116 , ! !

Indicated tumor glycosaminoglycan contents are approximate . Reproduced from Swabb . â€¢ / al . ( 66 ) with permission . The analysis of Swabb et al . ( 66 ) assumes that diffusion and convection occur in the same direction making X > 0 . If these processes occur in the opposite direction Xwould be negative . In addition , due to spatial heterogeneity in the interstitial pressure , solute concentration , interstitial volume fraction , pol ysaccharide concentration , charge distribution , binding , fluid viscosity , and tissue hydration , Xmay differ from one location to another in the tissue . The need for experimental and theo retical investigations to address these issues is urgent . V . Conclusions and Future Perspective The objective of this review article was to summarize our current understanding of transport of fluid and solute molecules in the tumor interstitium . To this end , we have discussed various experimental and theoretical approaches to quantify interstitial transport in tissues . The data available in the literature suggest that the tumor interstitium is significantly different in structure and function from the interstitium of most normal tissues . In general , the tumor interstitial compartment is characterized by a large interstitial space , high collagen content , low proteogly - 3048 on April 20 , 2017 . © 1987 American Association for Cancer Research . cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from INTERSTITIAL TRANSPORT IN TUMORS can and hyaluronate concentrations , and absence of anatomi cally well - defined functioning lymphatic network compared to most normal tissues . These structural differences are presum ably responsible for high interstitial fluid pressure and bulk fluid flow and high effective interstitial diffusion coefficient of macromolecules as well as large hydraulic conductivity in tu mors . Despite rapid progress in this area in recent years , there is a paucity of quantitative data on interstitial transport parameters in tissues and several questions remain unanswered . Through out the text , these unresolved problems were pointed out in hopes of stimulating multidisciplinary research in this area . In what follows , some of these problems are summarized . Despite the overwhelming evidence and importance of in creased interstitial convection in tumors , there are no direct measurements of magnitude and / or direction of convective velocity in normal and tumor tissues . Recent development in fluorescent microscopy should permit measurements of convec tive versus diffusive transport in the interstitium . Availability of such information would help in determining optimal size of macromolecules for tumor detection and treatment . Although macroscopic interstitial pressure gradients have been measured from the center of a tumor to its periphery , there are no measurements to date of microscopic pressure gradients around individual vessels . This information is needed to relate convective velocity of fluid around vessels with the bulk flow of fluid in the tumor interstitial compartment . While high interstitial diffusion coefficients of macromole cules favor movement of large molecules in the tumor intersti tium , high interstitial pressure and low microvascular pressure may retard extravasation of cells and molecules , especially in large tumors . Methods must be developed , therefore , to mod ulate these pressures to increase extravasation without signifi cantly reducing interstitial transport in large tumors . Most data on the composition of and transport in the tumor interstitium are available for animal tumors . Recent develop ments in various noninvasive techniques , e . g . , nuclear magnetic resonance , positron emission tomography , should permit col lection of tissue uptake data in patients . Availability of such information should help in determining the transport parame ters for human tissues and ultimately in predicting uptake and distribution of pharmacological agents in patients using various mathematical models . The need for research in this area is urgent . Acknowledgments The author wishes to express his sincere gratitude to Dr . P . M .
