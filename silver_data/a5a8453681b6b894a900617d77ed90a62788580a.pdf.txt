Heparin Mimics Extracellular DNA in Binding to Cell Surface - Localized Proteins and Promoting Staphylococcus aureus Bioﬁlm Formation Surabhi Mishra , a Alexander R .

Bioﬁlms form on these implants and are held together by a matrix composed of proteins , polysaccharides , and extracellular DNA ( eDNA ) . Heparin is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan that is routinely used in central venous catheters to pre - vent thrombosis , but it has been shown to stimulate S . aureus bioﬁlm formation through an unknown mechanism . Data presented here reveal that heparin enhances bioﬁlm capacity in many S . aureus and coagulase - negative staphylococcal strains , and it is incorporated into the USA300 methicillin - resistant S . aureus ( MRSA ) bioﬁlm matrix . The S . aureus USA300 bioﬁlms containing heparin are sensitive to proteinase K treatment , which suggests that proteins have an important structural role during heparin incorporation . Multiple heparin - binding proteins were identiﬁed by pro - teomics of the secreted and cell wall fractions . Proteins known to contribute to bio - ﬁlm were identiﬁed , and some proteins were reported to have the ability to bind eDNA , such as the major autolysin ( Atl ) and the immunodominant surface protein B ( IsaB ) . Mutants defective in IsaB showed a moderate decrease in bioﬁlm capacity in the presence of heparin . Our ﬁndings suggested that heparin is substituting for eDNA during S . aureus bioﬁlm development . To test this model , eDNA content was increased in bioﬁlms through inactivation of nuclease activity , and the heparin en - hancement effect was attenuated . Collectively , these data support the hypothesis that S . aureus can incorporate heparin into the matrix and enhance bioﬁlm capacity by taking advantage of existing eDNA - binding proteins . IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase - negative staphylococci ( CoNS ) are the leading causes of catheter implant infections . Identifying the factors that stimulate catheter infection and the mechanism involved is important for preventing such infections . Heparin , the main component of catheter lock solutions , has been shown previously to stimulate S . aureus bioﬁlm formation through an unknown pathway . This work identiﬁes multiple heparin - binding proteins in S . aureus , and it reveals a potential mechanism through which heparin enhances bioﬁlm capacity . Understanding the details of the heparin enhancement effect could guide future use of appropriate lock solutions for catheter implants . KEYWORDS heparin , Staphylococcus aureus , bioﬁlm , eDNA , glycosaminoglycan , MRSA , extracellular DNA I nserting catheters to gain access to veins is common hospital practice . The challenge is that catheter implant material is readily colonized by skin commensal bacteria , which can persist on the catheter and gain access to the bloodstream .

Thus , there is a clear need to understand the mechanisms underlying CRBSI development and develop improved strategies for their prevention . Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the two most commonly isolated bacteria from CRBSIs , followed by enterococci , aerobic Gram - negative bacilli , and yeast ( 2 , 3 ) . S . aureus is a human commensal and colonizes approximately 20 % of the population , while 60 % of the population are transient carriers ( 4 ) . S . aureus implant infections are often characterized by the formation of bioﬁlms , which are aggregates of bacteria encased in an extracellular matrix that protects them from host immune responses and antibiotic intervention ( 5 ) . S . aureus can form bioﬁlms as early as 24 h after catheter placement ( 6 ) . The extent of bioﬁlm formation inside catheters depends on the duration of catheterization and the properties of the ﬂuids administered through them ( 7 ) . Central venous catheters are often ﬁlled with heparin , a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan ( 8 ) , which is used as an anticoagulant to maintain catheter patency . A previous study by Shanks and coworkers showed that sodium heparin promotes in vitro bioﬁlm formation with S . aureus ( 9 ) . Recently , Ibberson et al . showed that heparin stimulates bioﬁlm formation in methicillin - resistant S . aureus ( MRSA ) as well , but the mechanism remains unknown ( 10 ) . Despite the fact that heparin has bioﬁlm - enhancing properties and could be a risk factor for patients , it remains the lock solution of choice in most hospital settings . Heparin is an anionic polysaccharide and interacts with a variety of proteins from bacteria as well as higher organisms ( 11 ) . Physiologically , heparin is synthesized exclu - sively in mast cells ( 8 ) . Mast cells are abundant at the boundaries between the environment and the host internal milieu and are involved in allergic and anaphylactic reactions . Therefore , it is not uncommon for bacteria present on skin and mucosa of the lungs to encounter heparin . In fact , Ronnberg et al . reported induction of multiple mast cell genes when mast cells were cocultured with S . aureus , although heparin biosyn - thesis genes were not observed ( 12 ) . Many studies have focused on in vitro binding of proteins to heparin during fractionation , and therefore , these studies may not identify true physiological interactions . Nevertheless , heparin binding to proteins on the cell surfaces of several pathogenic microorganisms was found to be important , such as induction of protective immunity to Neisseria meningitidis ( 13 ) , loss of virulence in Candida albicans ( 14 ) , inhibition of the blood stage growth of Plasmodium falciparum ( 15 ) , and invasion of gastrointestinal epithelial cells by Cryptosporidium parvum ( 16 ) . In the present study , the mechanism of heparin bioﬁlm enhancement with S . aureus was investigated . Microscopy demonstrated that heparin was incorporated into the bioﬁlm matrix , and protease treatment disintegrated heparin - containing bioﬁlms . Bio - chemical and genetic approaches identiﬁed speciﬁc surface and matrix proteins that mediate assembly of heparin - containing bioﬁlms , and some of the proteins identiﬁed are known extracellular DNA ( eDNA ) - binding proteins . Our ﬁndings suggest that these eDNA - binding proteins on the S . aureus surface associate with heparin and facilitate bioﬁlm enhancement . RESULTS Heparin enhances bioﬁlm formation in multiple strains of S . aureus and coagulase - negative staphylococci . Shanks and coworkers reported that the addition of 1 , 000 U / ml of sodium heparin to the growth medium stimulated bioﬁlm formation in S . aureus strain MZ100 and a few other related strains ( 9 ) . To determine the prevalence of this phenomenon , the effect of heparin on bioﬁlm formation was tested in various clinical isolates of S . aureus , including both methicillin - susceptible S . aureus ( MSSA ) and MRSA strains . A total of 9 strains of S . aureus were analyzed for bioﬁlm formation in the presence of 100 U / ml of sodium heparin or ammonium heparin in an in vitro bioﬁlm assay ( 17 ) . A dose of 100 U / ml is a clinically relevant dose of sodium heparin and was used in all further experiments in this work unless mentioned otherwise ( 18 ) . Ammonium heparin chemically resembles sodium heparin , and it was Mishra and Horswill May / June 2017 Volume 2 Issue 3 e00135 - 17 msphere . asm . org 2 included in most of the experiments to rule out the effect of sodium addition alone . In bioﬁlm microtiter assays , heparin stimulated increase in bioﬁlm biomass for seven out of nine strains ( Fig . 1A ) , and the phenomenon was spread across different strain lineages . Strains showing heparin - mediated increase in the assay also showed pro - nounced aggregation of cells when grown overnight in culture tubes ( see Fig . S1 in the supplemental material ) . A few strains did not exhibit enhanced bioﬁlm formation in the presence of heparin ( Fig . 1A , strains MW2 and UAMS1 ) , and these strains aggregated poorly ( Fig . S1 ) . Analysis of the effects of heparin on bioﬁlm formation was further extended to coagulase - negative staphylococci ( CoNS ) , including Staphylococcus epidermidis , S . lug - dunensis , S . hominis , S . haemolyticus , S . saprophyticus , and S . warneri . There is increasing incidences of device - related infections of S . epidermidis and other related CoNS species ( 19 ) , and thus , we extended our analysis of heparin impact to these CoNS . S . epider - midis , S . haemolyticus , and S . hominis showed a 90 % to 400 % increase in bioﬁlm biomass with heparin supplementation , whereas S . lugdunensis , S . warneri , and S . sap - rophyticus remained unaffected under the conditions used ( Fig . 1B ) . Taken together , these results suggest that heparin - mediated increase in bioﬁlm biomass is a wide - spread phenomenon among various strains of S . aureus and CoNS . To further investigate the heparin enhancement mechanism , a community - associated MRSA ( CA - MRSA ) isolate of the USA300 lineage ( strain LAC ) was used in this work . This strain was chosen because of its clinical signiﬁcance and the availability of FIG 1 Heparin enhances S . aureus and coagulase - negative staphylococcus ( CoNS ) bioﬁlm formation .

Reports of isolation of USA300 in bioﬁlm infections such as infective endocarditis , osteomyelitis , and prosthetic joint infections have increased ( 21 – 23 ) , suggesting these strains are relevant for study of bioﬁlm mechanisms . As noted above , LAC bioﬁlm capacity is enhanced with sodium or ammonium heparin ( Fig . 1A ) , and further testing showed a dose - dependent increase in bioﬁlm biomass with sodium heparin that plateaued at about 100 U / ml ( Fig . 1C ) . Heparin does not impact S . aureus growth or pH . A series of initial experiments were carried out to investigate the mechanism of heparin enhancement of bioﬁlms . One possible mechanism is through heparin improvement of S . aureus growth , since bacteria have been observed to degrade and grow on heparin ( 24 ) . However , heparin supplementation did not affect growth of the wild - type LAC strain ( Fig . S2 ) , suggesting that heparin impacts some phase of bioﬁlm development . For in vitro studies , glucose is a known additive that positively impacts S . aureus bioﬁlm formation ( 25 ) , and this occurs through a decrease in the pH of the medium due to acetate excretion ( 26 ) , repressing the agr quorum - sensing regulon ( 26 ) . However , heparin supplementation in tryptic soy broth ( TSB ) did not lower the pH , even after bioﬁlms were allowed to form for 18 h ( Table 1 ) . The only major changes in pH observed in the bioﬁlm medium with various S . aureus strains were due to glucose supplementation . Heparin increases bioﬁlm cell retention but does not initiate attachment . Bioﬁlms consist of aggregates of bacteria attached to a surface and held together in a complex extracellular matrix ( 5 , 27 ) . We hypothesized that heparin may alter the properties of the matrix , leading to enhanced retention of cells that results in a thicker , more dense bioﬁlm structure . To test this hypothesis , the number of CFU within the bioﬁlm was determined and compared to the number of planktonic cells surrounding the bioﬁlm , with and without heparin supplementation . Importantly , the number of CFU increased up to 50 % in the presence of sodium heparin , while the total number of cells ( both planktonic and bioﬁlm ) remained unaffected ( Fig . 2A ) . This increase in bioﬁlm biomass and CFU was independent of glucose supplementation ( data not shown ) . These data suggest that heparin retains S . aureus cells within the bioﬁlm matrix at the expense of neighboring planktonic cells . Bioﬁlm formation begins with bacterial attachment to a surface , and the positive impact of heparin on S . aureus bioﬁlms could be due in part to improved cell attachment . This question was tested by coating microtiter wells with sodium heparin ( 100 U / ml ) , washing with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) to remove free heparin , and then inoculating with strain LAC to initiate bioﬁlm development . Control wells were set up in parallel with an identical concentration of heparin added to the medium at the time of inoculation . As shown in Fig . 2B , the heparin - dependent increase in bioﬁlm biomass was observed only in the control wells , suggesting that heparin does not facilitate direct bacterial attachment to the microtiter plates . Similar results were obtained using glass plates ( Fig . 2B ) , indicating that altering the surface chemistry does TABLE 1 Effect of heparin on pH Strain pH of medium a TSB TSB (cid:2) AH TSB (cid:2) SH TSB (cid:2) G TSB (cid:2) G (cid:2) AH TSB (cid:2) G (cid:2) SH None ( control ) 7 . 34 7 . 33 7 . 34 7 . 34 7 . 34 7 . 33 Wild - type LAC 6 . 86 6 . 85 6 . 94 4 . 89 4 . 91 4 . 89 Newman 6 . 59 6 . 67 6 . 63 4 . 88 4 . 76 4 . 93 RN6390 6 . 67 6 . 61 6 . 68 4 . 65 4 . 88 4 . 7 MN8 6 . 65 6 . 84 6 . 79 5 . 06 5 . 06 5 . 03 FRI 1161 6 . 69 6 . 79 6 . 72 5 . 02 5 . 01 5 . 02 UAMS - 1 7 . 06 7 . 04 6 . 96 4 . 87 4 . 85 4 . 91 MW2 6 . 76 6 . 79 6 . 79 4 . 76 4 . 66 4 . 75 SH1000 6 . 9 6 . 82 6 . 75 4 . 98 4 . 96 4 . 96 JE2 6 . 72 6 . 79 6 . 78 4 . 97 5 . 02 4 . 96 a Tryptic soy broth ( TSB ) alone or supplemented with 100 U / ml of ammonium heparin ( AH ) , 100 U / ml of sodium heparin ( SH ) , and / or 0 . 2 % glucose ( G ) .

Taken together , heparin improves S . aureus cell retention within a bioﬁlm but does not enhance surface attachment . To further investigate these observations , bioﬁlms were allowed to establish before heparin supplementation . Remarkably , heparin still increased bioﬁlm biomass within 1 h of addition ( Fig . 2C ) . This observation held true even if chloramphenicol was added to inhibit protein synthesis just prior to heparin addition ( data not shown ) , suggesting that heparin does not induce production of bioﬁlm - related proteins . Further support for this interpretation came from experiments in which S . aureus was grown for 18 h in culture tubes and transferred to the wells of a microtiter plate . The addition of heparin to these cell suspensions promoted bioﬁlm formation within 1 h ( Fig . 2D ) . If the cells were washed before transfer to the microtiter plate , heparin did not enhance bioﬁlm formation ( Fig . 2D ) . Washing not only affects the pH of the medium but also removes FIG 2 Heparin enhances cell retention within a bioﬁlm but does not promote attachment . ( A ) The fraction of planktonic cells compared to bioﬁlm cells was determined by suspending either the entire contents of a microtiter well ( total ) or just the bioﬁlm after removal of spent medium ( bioﬁlm ) . When heparin was present , the number of planktonic cells was negligible compared to the number of cells in the bioﬁlm . ( B ) The wells of a polystyrene or glass - bottom microtiter plate were incubated with 100 U / ml of heparin in PBS for 24 h [ indicated by “ ( c ) ” ( for coated ) ] , washed to remove free heparin , and inoculated with strain LAC . After 18 h of incubation , bioﬁlm biomass was assessed . As a negative control , wells were preincubated with PBS , and as a positive control , heparin was added at the time of inoculation with the LAC strain . ( C ) To assess the kinetics of heparin enhancement of bioﬁlm formation , heparin was added at the time of inoculation ( 0 h ) or after 18 h of growth in the absence of heparin ( 18 h ) . Bioﬁlm biomass was determined after one additional hour of incubation . ( D ) Effect of washing on heparin - dependent bioﬁlm formation . Strain LAC was grown for 18 h in the absence of heparin , at which time the cells were washed to remove secreted proteins and then transferred to the wells of a microtiter plate . Heparin was added , and bioﬁlm biomass was assessed after 1 h . For comparison , the assay was also performed using the planktonic cells directly ( unwashed ) . A glucose - only control ( glc ) received no heparin . Values in each panel are the averages (cid:2) standard deviations from three independent experiments . Statistical signiﬁcance ( * , P (cid:3) 0 . 05 ; * * , P (cid:3) 0 . 005 ) was determined by a Student t test and is based on comparison to the value for the untreated control for each condition .

Collectively , these ﬁndings are consistent with a model in which heparin facilitates the rapid capture of planktonic cells from the surrounding liquid phase and incorporates them into the bioﬁlm . The negative impact of washing suggests extracellular proteins might be involved , and this question is further addressed below . Heparin localizes within the bioﬁlm matrix . The model described above predicts that heparin is incorporated into the bioﬁlm extracellular matrix . To test this idea , a green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - expressing LAC strain was allowed to grow to station - ary phase ( 18 h ) , at which time rhodamine - labeled heparin ( rhodamine - heparin ) was added . After an additional hour of incubation , bioﬁlms were examined by confocal microscopy . As predicted , rhodamine - heparin was found to accumulate around the green ﬂuorescent LAC strain ( Fig . 3A ) . Bioﬁlms that lacked exogenously added rhodamine - heparin showed only green ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 3B ) . The importance of heparin as a potential matrix component was further tested using heparinase ( heparin lyase ) , which catalyzes breakdown of heparin into constituent disaccharides . Initially , heparinase was added together with heparin at the time of inoculation . In this case , heparinase limited the enhancement of bioﬁlm formation by heparin ( Fig . 3C ) , presum - ably due to breaking down before a positive impact on the bioﬁlm could be observed . If heparin was added and the bioﬁlm was allowed to establish , the addition of heparinase had no effect ( Fig . 3C ) . In a mature bioﬁlm , it is possible that heparin is inaccessible to the enzyme , or potentially an established bioﬁlms is not affected by the removal of heparin from the matrix . With evidence that heparin is incorporated into the matrix , these observations raise questions of whether it substitutes for , or works together with , other components of the matrix . Heparin substitutes for eDNA in the bioﬁlm matrix . S . aureus bioﬁlms have an extracellular matrix that consists of polysaccharides , proteins , and eDNA ( 5 , 27 – 30 ) . Evidence in favor of eDNA as an important matrix component came in part from studies FIG 3 Heparin localizes in the S . aureus bioﬁlm matrix .

Strain LAC was allowed to form bioﬁlms for 18 h in the absence ( (cid:4) ) ( control ) or presence of heparin . Where indicated , heparinase was added at the time of inoculation ( 0 h ) or after allowing bioﬁlms to form for 17 h . Values are the averages (cid:2) standard deviations from three independent experiments . Statistical signiﬁcance ( * , P (cid:3) 0 . 05 ) was determined by a Student t test .

A mutant defective in the nuc gene , which encodes the major secreted nuclease in strain LAC , forms larger bioﬁlms and accumulates more eDNA in the matrix than the wild type does ( 31 , 32 ) . Heparin is a large polyanionic polymer like eDNA and potentially could mimic the function of eDNA in the bioﬁlm matrix . The observed heparin interaction with surface - localized proteins ( Fig . 2D and 3 ) , and positive impact on bacterial aggregation ( Fig . S1 ) , are consistent with this line of reasoning . Therefore , we hypothesized that heparin - dependent bioﬁlm would be affected by modulating the level of eDNA in the matrix . To test this hypothesis , the effect of heparin on bioﬁlm formation was assayed in nuclease mutants , which accumulate more eDNA than wild - type strains do ( 31 ) . A LAC nuc mutant exhibited more - robust bioﬁlms than the wild type did , consistent with previous reports ( 31 ) , but the addition of heparin did still lead to a further increase in bioﬁlm biomass ( Fig . 4 ) . Conversely , a LAC nuc2 mutant , which lacks the additional surface - localized nuclease ( 33 ) , formed a bioﬁlm like the wild - type - like bioﬁlm that was signiﬁcantly enhanced by exogenous heparin . This observation is consistent with previous reports that mutations in nuc2 are not linked to bioﬁlm formation ( 33 ) . When both nuc and nuc2 were removed , maximizing eDNA levels in the matrix , heparin bioﬁlm enhancement was reduced ( Fig . 4 ) and no longer reached signiﬁcance with ammonium heparin . These ﬁndings support a model in which heparin and eDNA can substitute for one another in the bioﬁlm matrix , both leading to a positive impact on bioﬁlm biomass . Proteins are required for heparin - dependent bioﬁlm formation . On the basis of the results of the washing experiments ( Fig . 2D ) , we predicted that surface and / or extracellular proteins are involved in heparin bioﬁlm enhancement . To address this question , the sensitivity of heparin bioﬁlms to proteinase K treatment was tested . Notably , proteinase K treatment completely disintegrated the bioﬁlm containing hep - arin , regardless of whether heparin was added at the time of inoculation or after bioﬁlms had been allowed to form for 18 h ( Fig . 5A ) . Proteinase K also disintegrated the bioﬁlm in the control wells that lacked heparin , suggesting that the bioﬁlm of the LAC strain is mostly held together by proteins , as shown previously ( 34 , 35 ) . This ﬁnding was further investigated using a LAC mutant lacking all secreted proteases ( AH1919 strain , Δproteases ) ( 36 , 37 ) , which formed a more robust bioﬁlm than the wild - type strain did ( Fig . 5B ) , presumably by eliminating self - cleavage of surface / extracellular proteins . The bioﬁlm of the protease deﬁcient strain was further increased by heparin addition . This observation suggests that heparin does not stimulate bioﬁlm biomass by inhibiting secreted protease activity . To gain further information on the proteins involved in FIG 4 Effect of eDNA on heparin - mediated bioﬁlm formation . Effect of heparin on bioﬁlm formation in mutants defective in one or both nucleases ( nuc and nuc2 ) was compared with the wild - type LAC strain . Three independent biological experiments were performed , each with four technical replicates , and the error bars represent the standard deviation of the entire data set . Statistical signiﬁcance ( * , P (cid:3) 0 . 05 ) was determined by a Student t test .

The srtA : : Tn mutant still formed a bioﬁlm with glucose , but the enhancement with heparin ( either sodium or ammonium forms ) was reduced compared to strain JE2 , which suggests that sortase - anchored proteins may have some contribution to the heparin phenotype . Taken together , the heparin bioﬁlm enhancement depends on S . aureus surface / extracellular proteins , and the phenotype is independent of known secreted proteases . Identiﬁcation of heparin - binding proteins by mass spectrometry . In order to identify the matrix proteins that interact with heparin , the wild - type LAC strain was grown in bioﬁlm media containing 100 U / ml of sodium heparin for 18 h . Heparin - binding proteins were identiﬁed separately in the culture supernatant and cell wall fractions . Brieﬂy , the culture was centrifuged to pellet the cells , and additional heparin was added to the supernatant fraction to capture secreted heparin - binding proteins . Protoplasts were prepared , and heparin was added to the supernatant to capture released cell wall proteins . Avidin - agarose beads were used to precipitate heparin from the supernatant and cell wall fractions , and associated proteins were eluted , separated by SDS - PAGE , and visualized by silver staining . Isolated bands were excised from the gel , digested with trypsin in situ , and analyzed by mass spectrometry . Using 15 % FIG 5 Proteins mediate heparin - dependent bioﬁlm formation .

Peptides corresponding to nine of these proteins appeared in both fractions . The majority of the proteins identiﬁed in the cell wall fraction were cytoplasmic ; however , some of the cytoplasmic proteins have been reported to localize on the cell wall in the bioﬁlms ( 38 – 40 ) . The most abundant protein in the secreted fraction was bifunctional autolysin ( Atl ) , which is the major peptidoglycan hydrolase in S . aureus ( 41 ) . Atl was followed by protein A in the secreted fraction , and protein A was the most abundant protein in the cell wall fraction . Protein A is a cell wall - anchored ( CWA ) protein that is shed at high levels ( 42 , 43 ) , and it contains four or ﬁve homologous modules that can bind to multiple ligands ( 44 ) . Apart from protein A , four other cell wall - anchored proteins were detected in the secreted fraction : penicillin - binding protein 2 = ( PBP2 = ) , SasG ( SAUSA300 _ 2436 ) , a putative surface protein ( SAUSA300 _ 0883 ) , and another surface protein ( SAUSA300 _ 2164 ) . SasG is a known CWA surface protein that promotes bioﬁlm forma - tion by S . aureus ( 45 ) . Interestingly , SasG ( SAUSA300 _ 2436 ) is truncated after 444 amino acids in the LAC strain , while SasG in other strains is intact at ~ 1 , 630 amino acids , depending on the strain . PBP2 = is present only in the MRSA strains and has been observed to affect bioﬁlm formation in MRSA strain BH1CC ( 46 ) . SAUSA300 _ 2164 and SAUSA300 _ 0883 have not been studied , but their heparin binding ability suggests that they probably increase cell - cell interaction by binding to heparin . Detection of a few CWA proteins in the secreted fraction could be due to cell lysis . However , CWA proteins were not detected in the cell wall fraction . It is plausible that the large size ( (cid:5) 100 kDa ) might prevent the proteins from being captured in the heparin - binding assay . Moreover , CWA proteins have been reported to be low during planktonic growth compared to the immature bioﬁlms ( 47 ) . Also , high protease activity during the stationary phase of growth would likely result in their cleavage and localization in the secreted fraction than in the cell wall fraction . Five cytoplasmic proteins were among the top 10 heparin - binding proteins in both the secreted and cell wall fractions : enolase , elongation factor Ts , glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , elongation factor Tu , and a Zn - dependent alcohol dehydrogenase ( Table 2 ) . Although cytoplasmic proteins in the cell wall fraction could be the result of contamination , recent studies suggest that this is not the case . Cytoplasmic proteins such as GAPDH and enolase have been reported to be a main constituent of the S . aureus bioﬁlm matrix ( 38 ) . These proteins reversibly associate with the cell surface at low pH and interact with eDNA to form a network of cells within the matrix ( 48 ) . Additionally , nucleic acid - binding proteins such as IsaB ( 49 ) , HU , elongation factors , and ribosomal proteins were detected in the secreted and cell wall fractions , consistent with the hypothesis that heparin can substitute for eDNA in the bioﬁlm matrix . There are some reports of toxins contributing to cell - cell interactions . The pore - forming cytotoxin alpha - hemolysin ( Hla ) has a role in S . aureus bioﬁlm formation ( 50 ) and was identiﬁed in high levels of the secreted fraction ( Table 2 ) . Additional heparin - binding toxins included Panton - Valentine leukocidin ( LukSF ) , enterotoxin Q , and LukG . The signal peptide of LukSF has been reported to act as a bridge between S . aureus and the heparin / heparan sulfate component of host extracellular matrix ( ECM ) in vivo ( 51 ) . Although this signal peptide was not detected speciﬁcally in the heparin - binding assay , it is likely that the processed proteins possess a heparin - binding property as well . The appearance of multiple proteins with diverse physiological roles in the heparin - bound fraction suggests that the interaction between heparin and protein is somewhat nonspeciﬁc . However , heparin - binding motifs have been identiﬁed in some proteins from higher organisms , and these motifs consist of a linear array of basic and hydro - phobic amino acids .

Analysis of mutants lacking individual heparin - binding proteins for their abil - ity to form heparin - dependent bioﬁlms . Seventeen of the 40 heparin - binding pro - teins identiﬁed from the secreted fraction were tested for their signiﬁcance in follow - up bioﬁlm assays using insertion mutants from the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library ( 15 ) . These 17 mutants were chosen because they are known or predicted to be either secreted or surface exposed , and transposon mutants were available in the library . All 17 of the mutants still responded to heparin by forming an enhanced bioﬁlm , but in several cases , the magnitude of the response was relatively modest ( Table 3 ) . For example , whereas exogenous heparin increased bioﬁlm biomass of the wild - type LAC strain by 80 to 100 % , more modest increases of 20 to 40 % were observed from mutants lacking IsaB , N - acetylmuramoyl - L - alanine amidase , Panton - Valentine leukocidin , LukS - PV , and a leukocidin / hemolysin toxin family protein ( SAUSA300 _ 1974 ) ( Table 3 ) . The fact that none of the mutants assayed completely lost the ability to respond to heparin suggests that there is redundancy in the binding ability . Additionally , essential cyto - plasmic proteins such as GAPDH and enolase , whose mutants were not available in the transposon library , might play an important role in heparin - containing bioﬁlms . DISCUSSION Staphylococci are the dominant pathogens associated with indwelling medical device infections ( 19 ) . A characteristic feature of these infections is the formation of bioﬁlms , which are recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment and host immune responses . It was previously reported that sodium heparin used in catheter lock solutions stimulates S . aureus bioﬁlm formation , but the mechanism of this enhancement has remained elusive ( 9 ) . Many surface and regulatory factors contributing to S . aureus bioﬁlms have been identiﬁed in the last 2 decades ( 5 , 27 , 54 ) , and some of the common bioﬁlm determinants identiﬁed ( e . g . , agr system , SarA , and polysaccharide ) do not play a signiﬁcant role in the heparin - mediated increase ( 9 ) . In this work , we sought to obtain a more complete understanding of the positive impact of heparin on staphylococcal bioﬁlm development .

Although heparin differs from hyaluronan in being highly negatively charged , they are structurally similar glycosaminoglycans . Heparin resembles another matrix component , eDNA , in being a polyanion , and therefore , we hypothesized that heparin would also be incorporated into the bioﬁlm matrix . Indeed , we observed heparin incorporation into the S . aureus bioﬁlm matrix ( Fig . 3A ) . These bioﬁlms re - mained proteinase K labile , suggesting that matrix proteins play a signiﬁcant role in the heparin - dependent enhancement phenotype . We used a pulldown assay coupled with proteomics to identify multiple S . aureus heparin - binding proteins from both the secreted and cell wall fractions . Interestingly , most of these proteins have been either identiﬁed or proposed as DNA - binding proteins . Atl was the most abundant heparin - bound protein in the secreted fraction ( Table 2 ) , and it is a bifunctional autolysin that contributes to bioﬁlm formation by release of cytoplasmic proteins and eDNA through cell lysis ( 41 , 55 , 56 ) . Atl has been shown to bind to eDNA and host proteins such as ﬁbrinogen , ﬁbronectin , and vitro - nectin , which often coat the surfaces of biomedical devices ( 57 , 58 ) . Two other abundant DNA - binding proteins identiﬁed were IsaB and HU . IsaB nonspeciﬁcally binds to nucleic acids ( 49 ) , and this protein was isolated from both the secreted and cell wall fractions in the heparin - binding assay . HU is an essential histone - like DNA - binding protein , which is capable of wrapping DNA to protect it from denaturation during extreme environmental conditions . Since heparin structurally resembles the eDNA component of the bioﬁlm matrix in being a polyanion , we propose that heparin can substitute for eDNA during S . aureus bioﬁlm formation . One of the best - characterized eDNA - binding proteins is beta toxin ( 59 ) , which was not detected in the heparin - binding assay . However , the LAC strain and many other S . aureus strains are reported to contain a bacteriophage ( (cid:3) Sa3 ) integrated into the structural gene , hlb , rendering it ineffective ( 60 , 61 ) . Support for our hypothesis that heparin substitutes for eDNA also came from the analysis of mutants defective in nucleases . These mutants contain higher levels of eDNA in the matrix and form more - robust bioﬁlms than the wild type does ( 31 – 33 ) . Importantly , bioﬁlm capacity of these mutants was not enhanced further by the addition of heparin ( Fig . 4 ) , suggesting that there is likely enough eDNA present to saturate binding sites . Taken together , these observations demonstrate that heparin TABLE 3 Effect of heparin on bioﬁlm biomass formation by transposon mutants of S . aureus strain USA300 _ FPR3757 FPR3757 no .

Our ﬁndings also support observations by Foulston and coworkers and Dengler and coworkers in explaining the contribution of cytoplasmic proteins , such as GADPH and enolase , to S . aureus bioﬁlm formation ( 38 , 48 ) . According to their proposed model , these cytoplasmic proteins become positively charged at low pH ( ~ 5 ) due to acidiﬁ - cation during growth on glucose , and the proteins interact with the negatively charged cell surface and eDNA to form bacterial aggregates . The eDNA is thought to tether bacterial cells together in the matrix , leading to enhanced bioﬁlm formation ( 62 ) . In the present work , our heparin - binding assay identiﬁed the same GAPDH and enolase proteins in both the secreted fraction and the cell wall fraction ( Table 2 ) . Additionally , heparin - dependent bioﬁlm formation was inhibited when the pH of the medium was altered by washing stationary - phase cells ( Fig . 2D ) , suggesting a similar pH - dependent bioﬁlm phenotype . Our observations suggest that heparin can interact with the same negatively charged cytoplasmic proteins , capturing and tethering cells together in the matrix and thereby promoting S . aureus bioﬁlm formation . Although multiple heparin - binding proteins were identiﬁed in this work , the nature of their interaction with heparin is not clear . The multiplicity of heparin - binding proteins suggests a relatively nonspeciﬁc interaction , such as an electrostatic interac - tion between two oppositely charged biomolecules . Literature reports on heparin - protein interaction lack information on the structural requirements of a protein for such an interaction ( 63 , 64 ) . Three different amino acid sequence - based motifs that contain basic and hydropathic amino acid residues in a certain order have been proposed on the basis of a few well - characterized heparin - protein interactions ( 52 , 53 ) . It has been suggested that positively charged residues in a protein interact with negatively charged carboxylate and sulfate ions of heparin ; however , these interactions did not seem to impart speciﬁcity . Consistent with this notion , only about half of the heparin - binding proteins identiﬁed in this study had heparin - binding motifs ( HBMs ) . These motifs were absent in key cytoplasmic proteins identiﬁed , including GAPDH , enolase , and elonga - tion factor Tu . Also , a well - characterized nucleic acid - binding protein , IsaB , which binds to heparin , lacked any linear HBMs , which suggests that these linear HBMs are only one component of the heparin - mediated increase in bioﬁlm formation . The widespread usage of heparin and increasing incidence of catheter - related infections suggest the need for alternative lock solutions . An ideal lock solution should prevent thrombosis and inhibit bacterial and fungal infections . Trisodium citrate ( 4 % ) with antithrombotic efﬁcacy similar to heparin has emerged as an alternative . The antithrombotic property of citrate is exerted by Ca 2 (cid:6) chelation ( 65 ) . Chelation of divalent metal ions such as Ca 2 (cid:6) and Mg 2 (cid:6) also helps to prevent bacterial colonization ( 66 ) and makes citrate a suitable alternative to heparin as a lock solution . Nevertheless , side effects due to citrate usage have limited its widespread implementation . Other alternatives to heparin include ethanol and taurolidine / citrate ; however , heparin still remains the antithrombotic chemical of choice in hospital settings . In order to avoid device - related infections , vancomycin is currently added to heparin lock solution ; however , the emergence of vancomycin - resistant S . aureus ( VRSA ) makes the usage of antimicrobial agents less reliable . Results of this work could guide future strategies to combat heparin - stimulated bioﬁlm formation on indwelling devices . MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth conditions . Bacterial strains used in this work are listed in Table 4 . S . aureus and coagulase - negative staphylococcal ( CoNS ) strains were routinely grown in tryptic soy broth ( TSB ) or on tryptic soy agar ( TSA ) plates . For microtiter plate - based bioﬁlm assay , S . aureus and CoNS strains were grown in 66 % TSB ( 20 g / liter of TSB ) supplemented with 0 . 2 % glucose at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm . Sodium heparin ( catalog no . H3393 ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) ( 100 U / ml ) or ammonium heparin ( catalog no . H6279 ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) ( 100 U / ml ) was added to the cultures where mentioned . When appropriate , the following antibiotics were added to the culture at the concentrations indicated : spectinomycin ( 1 , 000 (cid:4) g / ml ) and erythromycin ( 10 (cid:4) g / ml ) . Microtiter plate - based bioﬁlm assay . Bioﬁlms were routinely grown in 96 - well ﬂat - bottom poly - styrene microtiter Costar plates ( catalog no . 3595 ; Corning Inc . , Corning , NY ) . Where speciﬁed , glass Mishra and Horswill May / June 2017 Volume 2 Issue 3 e00135 - 17 msphere . asm . org 14 microtiter plates were used instead ( Costar [ catalog no . 3631 ; Corning Inc . ] ) . Brieﬂy , S . aureus cultures grown overnight in TSB were diluted 1 : 200 in 66 % TSB supplemented with 0 . 2 % glucose . Sodium heparin or ammonium heparin ( 100 U / ml ) was added to each experimental well wherever mentioned . Where stated , additional compounds were added to the bioﬁlm growth condition at the following concentra - tion : 25 U / ml of DNase I , 100 (cid:4) g / ml of proteinase K , and 30 (cid:4) g / ml of chloramphenicol . Microtiter plates for the bioﬁlm assay were maintained at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm for the indicated number of hours and assayed for bioﬁlm formation using a crystal violet staining method ( 28 ) . For measurement of bioﬁlm , cell suspension was removed from the wells prior to washing twice with 0 . 2 ml of 0 . 02 M phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Each bioﬁlm in a well was stained with 0 . 1 ml of crystal violet ( 0 . 1 % [ wt / vol ] in water ) for 10 min at room temperature . The plates were inverted and photographed with a Canon EOS Rebel digital camera . Bioﬁlm biomass was measured as the optical density at 595 nm ( OD 595 ) after solubilization of crystal violet stain with acidiﬁed ethanol ( 40 mM HCl in ethanol ) using a Tecan Inﬁnite 200 Pro microtiter plate reader ( Tecan Trading AG , Switzerland ) . Attachment to the microtiter plate surface . The effect of heparin on bacterial attachment was assayed in both polystyrene and glass microtiter plates . Brieﬂy , wells were pretreated with 200 (cid:4) l of 100 U / ml or 500 U / ml of heparin in 0 . 02 M PBS , pH 6 . 8 , for 24 h at 37°C without shaking . Control wells contained only 0 . 02 M PBS . After 24 h , all the wells were washed twice with 0 . 02 M PBS , and bioﬁlm assays were set up as described above . The attachment assay was also carried out on a glass surface using 96 - well glass - bottom microtiter plates ( catalog no . C3631 ; Corning Inc . , Corning , NY ) . Measurement of growth kinetics and cell viability . Overnight cultures were diluted 1 : 200 in TSB and grown until the OD 600 reached 0 . 1 ( log phase ) , then diluted 1 : 200 into 66 % TSB supplemented with 0 . 2 % glucose . Two hundred microliters of culture was dispensed into each well of the 96 - well ﬂat - bottom microtiter plate . Sodium heparin or ammonium heparin ( 100 U / ml ) was added to each experimental well , and growth was monitored as OD 600 using a Tecan Inﬁnite 200 Pro microtiter plate reader ( Tecan Trading AG , Switzerland ) . Final growth achieved in the bioﬁlm medium was also measured as the total number of CFU present in the bioﬁlm medium after 18 h . To do this , bacterial culture in each well was mixed properly by pipetting to dislodge the bioﬁlm . Proteinase K ( 100 (cid:4) g / ml ) was added to each well for 15 min at room temperature to disintegrate the bioﬁlm biomass . Proteinase K - treated bacteria were taken out in a microcentrifuge tube and vigorously vortexed to further remove aggregates prior to dilution into TSB . Appropriate dilutions were made in TSB and spread on TSA plates . The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C for colonies to appear , and the number of CFU was counted . In order to measure the number of CFU in bioﬁlm , bacterial suspension containing planktonic cells was removed from each well . The bioﬁlm biomass in each well was washed twice with sterile 0 . 02 M PBS and resuspended in 0 . 2 ml TSB and 100 (cid:4) g / ml of proteinase K . CFU was determined as mentioned above . Confocal microscopy . Confocal microscopy was performed with a Leica SP8 STED superresolu - tion microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Inc . , Wetzlar , Germany ) . For imaging , an overnight culture of S . aureus AH1359 , a derivative of wild - type USA300 expressing superfolder green ﬂuorescent protein ( sGFP ) was grown in TSB supplemented with 200 (cid:4) g / ml of spectinomycin ( 78 , 79 ) . This culture was diluted 200 - fold in bioﬁlm medium ( 66 % TSB supplemented with 0 . 2 % glucose ) , and 0 . 2 ml of culture was dispensed into each chamber of an eight - well chambered cover glass ( Lab - Tek cham - bered 1 . 0 borosilicate cover glass system ; Nunc , Rochester , NY ) . Bacteria were allowed to grow at 37°C for 18 h . After 18 h of growth , 0 . 5 mg / ml of rhodamine - labeled heparin ( rhodamine - heparin ) ( catalog no . HP - 204 ; Creative PEGWorks ) was added to each test well , and incubation was continued for another hour at 37°C . Liquid media containing planktonic cells was removed , and bioﬁlms were TABLE 4 Bacterial strains used in this study Strain Description Reference ( s ) or source AH1263 S . aureus USA300 CA - MRSA Erm s ( LAC ) 71 JE2 S . aureus CA - MRSA USA300 Erm s ; plasmid - cured LAC derivative 20 AH0204 S . aureus Newman ( MSSA strain ) 72 AH0206 S . aureus RN6390 ( agr (cid:6) laboratory strain related to strain 8325 - 4 but with a defective rsbU ) 73 AH0247 S . aureus MN8 ( clinical isolate from menstrual toxic shock syndrome case ) 74 AH0248 S . aureus FRI1169 AH0386 S . aureus SH1000 ( functional rsbU derivative of strain 8325 - 4 ) 75 AH0411 S . aureus UAMS - 1 ( MSSA USA200 osteomyelitis isolate ) 76 AH0843 S . aureus MW2 ( USA400 CA - MRSA ; clinical isolate from a necrotizing pneumonia case ) 77 AH1359 S . aureus AH1263 containing pCM12 ( an Escherichia coli - S . aureus shuttle vector expressing superfolder GFP ) Spec r 78 , 79 AH1680 S . aureus USA300 CA - MRSA Erm s ( LAC ) nuc : : LtrB 31 AH3051 S . aureus AH1263 nuc : : LtrB nuc2 : : erm 33 AH3057 S . aureus AH1263 nuc2 : : erm 33 AH1919 S . aureus LAC Δ aur Δ sspA Δ scpA Δ spl : : erm 36 AH1738 S . epidermidis 1457 80 BB2191 S . lugdunensis 81 BB2201 S . warneri P .

Twenty microliters of PBS was added to each well to prevent cells from dehydrating , and bioﬁlms were analyzed by confocal microscopy . An equal volume of 0 . 02 M PBS was added to each control well in place of rhodamine - heparin . The competition assay was also performed with the addition of rhodamine - heparin to the wells containing bioﬁlm grown in the presence of 100 U / ml of sodium heparin . Sample preparation for mass spectrometry . Overnight - grown USA300 wild - type culture in TSB was diluted 200 times in 100 ml of bioﬁlm medium ( 66 % TSB supplemented with 0 . 2 % glucose ) and grown at 37°C for 18 h with shaking at 200 rpm . Sodium heparin ( 200 U / ml ) was added to cultures grown for 18 h and incubated for an hour . The cultures were pelleted , and supernatant was concentrated using a 10 - kDa - cutoff Amicon Ultra - 15 centrifugal ﬁlter unit ( EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . Concentrated super - natant was buffer exchanged with 0 . 02 M PBS , pH 6 . 8 , using Amicon Ultra 0 . 5 - ml ﬁlter units . Protein samples were also prepared from the pellet fraction . The pellets were washed twice with 0 . 02 M PBS , pH 6 . 8 , and resuspended to an OD 600 of 30 in a lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl and 20 mM MgCl 2 [ pH 7 . 5 ] supplemented with 30 % rafﬁnose ) . Brieﬂy , cell pellets were incubated in a lysis buffer containing 200 (cid:4) g / ml of lysostaphin , 20 (cid:4) g / ml DNase I , and protease inhibitor ( mini Complete ; Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) for 30 min . Cell suspension was centrifuged at 6 , 000 (cid:7) g for 30 min at 4°C . The supernatant fraction was further concentrated by Amicon Ultra 0 . 5 - ml ﬁlter units . Peptide identiﬁcation by mass spectrometry . Portions ( 0 . 2 ml ) of the samples were incubated with 0 . 1 ml of avidin - agarose beads ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) for 30 min on a rocker at room temperature in the presence of 100 U / ml of sodium heparin . The beads were pelleted gently at 2 , 000 rpm for 2 min , and supernatant was withdrawn . The beads were then washed three times with 0 . 02 M PBS , pH 6 . 8 , to further remove the unbound proteins . The bound fraction was eluted with 0 . 1 ml of 3 M NaCl . Eluted samples were pooled and buffer exchanged with 0 . 02 M PBS , pH 6 . 8 , using a 10 - kDa - cutoff Amicon Ultra 0 . 5 - ml centrifugal ﬁlter unit before analyzing on SDS - polyacrylamide gels . The protein concentration in the sample was determined by the Bradford assay . Five micrograms of sample was mixed with 20 (cid:4) l lithium dodecyl sulfate ( LDS ) buffer ( pH 8 . 4 ) , divided into four fractions , and loaded on NuPage 4 to 12 % Bis - Tris precast gels ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Two peripheral lanes were loaded with Sharp prestained protein ladder standards ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , and the gel was run following the manufacturer’s protocol . One lane containing Sharp prestained standards and the accompanying lane loaded with one - fourth of the sample were excised and stained using a silver nitrate protocol ( QuickSilver ; Pierce ) . Silver nitrate - stained lanes were realigned with the unstained gel section to create a template for excision . Unstained lanes were segmented into 14 equal sections and subjected to in - gel tryptic digestion at 57°C for 16 h following the procedure of Shevchenko et al . ( 67 ) . One portion of the digested sample was mixed with an equal volume of a saturated solution of (cid:5) - cyano - 4 - hydroxycinnamic acid ( CHCA ) acid in 0 . 1 % triﬂuoroacetic acid ( Pierce , Madison , WI ) and spotted onto a stainless steel target plate with matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization – time of ﬂight ( MALDI - TOF ) analysis on an AutoFlex III TOF mass spectrometer ( Bruker , Billerica , MA ) to determine the quality of digestion . The rest of the gel extract was lyophilized , and concentrated peptides were rehydrated in 15 (cid:4) l of a solution of 0 . 1 % formic acid and 5 % liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) - grade acetonitrile ( ACN ) . The peptides were desalted using home - brew StageTips that involved loading 4 (cid:4) l of peptides on a Dionex 3000 nano rapid - separation liquid chromatography ( RSLC ) series high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) system ( Thermo Electron , USA ) at the rate of 2 (cid:4) l / min onto a precolumn packed with 5 - (cid:4) m YMC ODS - C18 beads ( Waters , Milford , MA ) . Desalted peptides were passed through an analytical column containing Halo solid - core C18 particles with a pore size of 300 Å ( Advanced Material Technology , Wilmington , DE , USA ) . Samples were eluted with a linear gradient of 95 % buffer A ( 0 . 1 % formic acid [ Pierce ] , 5 % acetonitrile [ Honeywell ] , and 94 . 9 % LC - MS - grade water ) to 55 % buffer B ( 90 % ACN , 9 . 9 % water , and 0 . 1 % formic acid [ FA ] ) . Eluted sample from LC - MS was directed to the electrospray source of a linear ion trap mass spectrometer ( LTQ / XL ; Thermo Electron , USA ) . Tandem mass spectrometry ( MS - MS ) spectra were acquired , and the six most intense peaks from each spectrum were selected . The raw data set of peptides was then reﬁned to a centroid list using Distiller ( version 2 . 5 ; Matrix Science , Cambridge , UK ) , and matched to staphylococcal protein sequences in the UniProt database of 15 October 2015 using the MASCOT 2 . 5 database search engine ( Matrix Science , Cambridge , UK ) . Spectral data sets were also processed and searched with the SpectrumMill proteomic workbench ( Rev A . 03 . 02 . 060 ; Agilent Tech - nologies , Santa Clara , CA ) . A minimum peptide ion score cutoff of 7 was set . Alignments from both engines were merged and curated using Scaffold ( v3 . 6 . 4 ; Proteome Software , Portland , OR ) . Scaffold software was used to rescore matches using the Protein Prophet algorithm . Scaffold results were restricted to a protein false - discovery rate of less than 1 % and with protein conﬁdence of more than 90 % . Proteins with at least two unique peptides were chosen . Bioinformatic analysis and screening of the transposon mutant library . The genome sequence of community - associated MRSA ( CA - MRSA ) USA300 strain FPR3757 was analyzed using web - based tools to identify proteins that contain a secretory signal or anchor to the cell wall or cell membrane with domains exposed outside the cell . USA300 strain FPR3757 is closest genetically in terms of sequenced strains . The presence of a signal peptide in the target open reading frame ( ORF ) was predicted using SignalP and PSORTb v . 3 . 0p ( 68 , 69 ) . Similarly , localization on the cell wall and on the cell membrane with extended regions facing outside cytoplasm was predicted by PSORTb v . 3 . 0 and TMHMM v . 2 . 0 ( 68 , 70 ) . Proteins were classiﬁed with respect to their location as either extracellular , cell wall associated , membrane , cytoplasmic , or unknown as determined by SignalP , PSORTb v . 3 . 0 , and TMHMM v . 2 . 0 ( 68 – 70 ) . Proteins that contain secretory signal , anchor to the cell wall , and contain transmembrane helices with exposed N - or C - terminal domains were chosen for further analysis .
