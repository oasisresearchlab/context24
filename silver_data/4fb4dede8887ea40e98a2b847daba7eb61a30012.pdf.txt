ABSTRACT ( word limit : 289 / 300 ) Introduction : Although SARS - CoV - 2 vaccines were first approved under Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA in late 2020 for adults , approval for young children 6 months to < 5 years of age did not occur until 2022 . Understanding real world vaccine effectiveness in the setting of emerging variants is critical . The primary goal of this study is to evaluate SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) against infection among children aged > 6 months and adults aged < 50 years . Methods : CASCADIA is a four - year community - based prospective study of SARS - CoV - 2 VE among adult and pediatric populations aged 6 months to 49 years in Oregon and Washington . At enrollment and regular intervals , participants complete a sociodemographic questionnaire . Individuals provide a blood sample at enrollment and annually thereafter , with additional , optional blood draws after infection and vaccination . Participants complete weekly self - collection of anterior nasal swabs and symptom questionnaires . Swabs are tested for SARS - CoV - 2 and other respiratory pathogens by RT - PCR , with results of selected pathogens returned to participants ; nasal swabs with SARS - CoV - 2 detected will undergo whole genome sequencing . Participants who report symptoms outside of their weekly swab collection and symptom survey are asked to collect an additional swab . Participants who test positive for SARS - CoV - 2 undergo serial swab collection every three days for three weeks . Serum samples are tested for SARS - CoV - 2 antibody by binding and neutralization assays . Analysis : Cox regression models will be used to estimate the hazard ratio associated with SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination among the pediatric and adult population , controlling for demographic factors and potential confounders , including clustering within households . for use under a CC0 license .

For instance , the emergence of the B . 1 . 1 . 529 ( Omicron ) variant in the US from September 2021 - January 2022 resulted in a 2 . 3 times higher peak hospitalization rate among children aged 5 - 11 years than the peak rate during the B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( Delta ) variant surge . 7 With emerging variants of concern ( VOCs ) , understanding infection and reinfection rates , and variant specific outcomes , will be important for future prevention planning . 8 - 15 During the COVID - 19 pandemic , a worldwide collaborative effort resulted in the development of COVID - 19 vaccines shown to decrease mortality and severe morbidity from SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 16 17 18 19 Due to emerging VOCs , waning antibody levels , and increased neutralizing antibody response following booster vaccines , booster vaccines have been implemented as a strategy for prevention of COVID - 19 disease in several countries including the United States . 20 21 VE data in the setting of novel VOCs may guide future vaccination strategies . From November 2021 to June 2022 , only the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine had received authorization for use among children aged ≥5 years for a primary vaccine series . 22 In May 2022 , a booster vaccine was for use under a CC0 license .

According to the CDC reported primary vaccine series completion stratified by age includes 1 . 7 % in children < 2 years , 3 . 2 % in 2 - 4 years , 31 . 6 % in 5 - 11 years , 60 . 8 % in 12 - 17 years , 65 . 5 % in 18 - 24 years , and 71 % in 25 - 49 years . The rate of first booster vaccine uptake is reported as 15 . 6 % in children 5 - 11 years , 29 . 3 % in 12 - 17 years , 34 . 2 % in 18 - 24 years , and 41 . 5 % in 25 - 49 years . 25 Many children remain unvaccinated . Additionally , parental / guardian vaccine hesitancy may delay pediatric vaccine uptake . As the landscape evolves with vaccine uptake , new emerging variants with potential for immune escape , and the introduction of novel vaccines , a longitudinal surveillance study will inform our understanding of vaccine effectiveness . In the CASCADIA study , active surveillance and testing protocols will systematically identify both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Enrolling a cohort of children as soon as possible after the recent EUA of bivalent pediatric vaccines enables us to estimate the real - world COVID - 19 VE in a pediatric population . The serology components of the protocol will allow for the evaluation of humoral immune responses to SARS - CoV - 2 infection and vaccination and will allow for comparisons of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for primary infection vs . reinfection over time . The study data will aid in informing public health measures and vaccine strategies . AIMS The primary study objective is to estimate the effectiveness of authorized COVID - 19 vaccines against laboratory - confirmed symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 virus infection among children aged 6 months to 17 years . A secondary objective is to estimate VE among adults 18 - 49 years of for use under a CC0 license . This article is a US Government work .

METHODS AND ANALYSIS Setting The CASCADIA study is being conducted in Washington ( WA ) and Oregon ( OR ) through a collaboration between Kaiser Permanente Northwest ( KPNW ) , University of Washington Medicine , and Seattle Children’s Hospital ( SCH ) . Study Design CASCADIA is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of children and adults designed to evaluate VE against laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection , and to estimate the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Approximately 2 , 400 children aged 6 months to 17 years and 1 , 100 adults aged 18 to 49 years will be enrolled and followed for up to four years ; the study population will be split equally between KPNW and UW / SCH . Households with multiple participants residing together will be prioritized for enrollment . The CASCADIA study is funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . Investigators from KPNW , UW , and SCH , in consultation with CDC , provided input on the study design , data collection instruments , laboratory testing procedures , data analysis , and implementation of this study . All sites utilize the same data collection instruments , and the protocol and study materials were reviewed and approved by the KPNW Institutional Review Board .

Prior to the official study launch , a soft launch was conducted targeting 3 - 5 families per site ( KPNW and UW ) and feedback was collected prior to beginning general study enrollment . The soft launch led to improvements in participant facing materials and contributed to the broader recruitment strategy ( Figure 1 ) . Recruitment strategies involve outreach to KPNW health plan members and local school districts and daycares ; press releases and social media campaigns ; and outreach to community - based organizations and other health care partners , prioritizing those with strong ties to racial and ethnic minorities and low - income individuals , where possible . Recruitment activities will continue during the study to replace participants who withdraw and adapted to meet demographic and vaccination enrollment targets . Data Collection Data collection and survey implementation is performed through Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) , a metadata - driven EDC software and database methodology designed at Vanderbilt University . 26 Web - based surveys are completed by participants and are entered directly into the study REDCap database . Screening A central study website ( www . cascadiastudy . org ) enables potential participants to review information about the study and eligibility criteria ( Table 2 ) and watch a video that provides an overview of the study and explains what is involved in participating in the study . The website links to an eligibility screener that collects names , age , sociodemographic data , contact information , enrollment site , and number of COVID - 19 vaccines received . The website is available in English and will be available Spanish . Study staff monitor data from the eligibility screener and eligible participants are contacted and scheduled for for use under a CC0 license . This article is a US Government work .

Study procedures including surveys and swabbing are demonstrated in Figures 2A & 2B ( also see Supplemental Table 4 ) . Weekly Surveys Participants or their parent / guardian complete a weekly Symptom & Swabbing survey which asks if they have experienced > 1 of the following symptoms for over 24 hours : fever or chills , cough , shortness of breath or difficulty breathing , fatigue , muscle or body aches , headache , new loss of taste or smell , sore throat , congestion or runny nose , nausea or vomiting , diarrhea , persistent pain or pressure in the chest , pale , gray , or blue - colored skin , lips , or nail beds . 27 28 29 Each participant is then prompted to collect a weekly nasal swab . As part of the weekly Symptom & Swabbing Survey , participants are asked whether they were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 outside of the study and if they had a known exposure to COVID - 19 . Additionally , participants can report new symptoms when they occur outside their weekly symptom and swabbing survey reporting day . Weekly Illness Update and Recovery from Illness Once an acute illness or positive test for SARS - CoV - 2 is identified ( Day 0 ) , participants are asked to answer an Infection / Illness Onset Survey that captures specific symptoms , date of symptom onset , overall health status , and potential COVID - 19 exposures . Following this survey , participants or their parent / guardian complete a post - infection / illness follow - up survey on Day 7 and Day 14 after they reported symptom onset . These surveys assess symptoms , recovery , overall health status , additional effects of their infection / illness ( e . g . , health care utilization and work and school absenteeism ) , and COVID - 19 prevention behaviors . A survey at Day 30 following a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test is completed to capture the continuation or resolution of symptoms , including illness / infection conditions , overall health for use under a CC0 license .

Participants who test positive for influenza and RSV will also complete a 30 - day post illness survey . Additionally , positive SARS - CoV - 2 study results trigger the serial collection of nasal swabs every 3 days for 21 days for both asymptomatic and symptomatic participants . If a participant reports a positive test for SARS - CoV - 2 outside the study , they will be prompted to collect a study swab within 72 hours . If the study swab is positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , serial swabbing will be triggered . Monthly Survey and Semi - annual Survey Following enrollment , updated job information , absenteeism , vaccination status , respiratory virus testing outside of the study , and overall health status are collected on a monthly basis . The monthly survey design involves rotating questions which may change during the study but could assess the receipt of influenza or other routine immunizations , participation in extracurricular activities , social and emotional burdens related to the pandemic , mitigation measures , and knowledge , attitudes , and perceptions about COVID - 19 vaccines and therapeutics . The semi - annual survey will include additional post - COVID - 19 conditions and lifestyle questions ( Supplemental Table 3 ) . Immunization Information Systems Sites will use data from state immunization information registries to obtain vaccination information for participants , including the Washington State Immunization Information System ( WA IIS ) and Oregon Health Authority ALERT Immunization Information System ( ALERT IIS ) . For participants enrolled in the KPNW health plan , vaccination history will also be obtained from medical records . Participants are consented prior to accessing these databases .

Participants are consented at enrollment for medical release of information . Respiratory Specimens Materials Swab kits include instructions , a sealed nasal swab , a dry tube with a barcode sticker linked to the individual participant , a biohazard bag , and a pre - addressed return polymailer bag ( International Air Transport Association - compliant Category B ; Figure 3A , 3B , 3C ) . All specimen collection materials are FDA - approved or authorized for SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR testing . Direct shipments of kits are sent on a regular basis to ensure a continuous supply of swabs available to participants . For households with multiple participants , the swab kit contains swabs for all household members . For these households , the collection kits for each household member are divided into separate boxes with labels used to designate each household member . At enrollment , each participant is asked to choose an animal , which is printed on a sticker that is used to label their swab kits and serve as a personal identifier throughout the study ( Figure 3D ) . In addition , each swab has a barcode which must be entered into the online Symptom and Swabbing survey to activate the swab and ensure correct processing and linkage of results to an individual participant . Collection and Processing TINY RHINOstic ( anterior nares ) ( Rhinostics , Boston , MA ) nasal swabs are being used for nasal specimen collection for all participants . For children aged 6 months to 12 years , a parent / guardian collects the nasal swab ; swabs can be collected by a parent / guardian or self - collected under supervision of their parent / guardian for children aged 13 to 17 . for use under a CC0 license .

Specimens from the Portland , OR and Vancouver , WA area are transported to Seattle twice daily by courier . The limit of detection at 2 - 4 molecules / µL , includes 100 % sensitivity , and 99 . 4 % specificity for SARS - CoV - 2 . 30 Swabs are processed at the lab within 48 hours of receipt . A participant communications team is available by phone seven days a week to assist participants . Laboratory Testing Nasal swab specimens are tested using an RT - PCR assay for SARS - CoV - 2 . All swabs are stored dry without media and eluted with 300µL Tris - EDTA for RHINOsticTM . 50µL of eluate is treated with proteinase K and heat for direct RT - qPCR ( Swab - Express RT - qPCR ) . 31 The RT - qPCR assay utilizes probe sets for SARS - CoV - 2 Orf1b and S gene ( Life Technologies ) against ancestral virus and are multiplexed with probe against RNaseP and set on a QuantStudio 6 instrument ( Applied Biosystems ) . 31 The laboratory is clinically certified to test for SARS - CoV - 2 by the Washington State Department of Health ( WA DOH ) . As funding permits , specimens will undergo multiplex RT - PCR testing for SARS - CoV - 2 , influenza A / B and RSV as well as other respiratory pathogens . Viral genome sequencing will be attempted on all SARS - CoV - 2 - positive samples with a Ct value of 35 or less using a hybrid capture method or a COVID - seq kit ( Illumina ) . Raw sequencing reads will be processed using the Seattle Flu Assembly Pipeline ( publicly available on GitHub ) . 32 Sequences will be aligned , and phylogenetic trees constructed using the Nextstrain augur software . All assembled genomes will be made publicly available in the GISAID database and categorized according to lineage . Return of Results The UW laboratory will provide RT - PCR results for SARS - CoV - 2 . Testing results will be loaded into a REDCap module and linked to participant records that correspond to the barcoded specimen kits . In for use under a CC0 license .

If a participant’s specimen tests positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , participants and or parents / guardians of participants will be contacted via text , email and / or phone for guidance on further study procedures . Positive SARS - CoV - 2 results will be reported to local and state public health authorities to be compliant with notifiable disease reporting guidelines . Serum and Blood Specimens Collection and Processing All participants are asked to provide blood samples prior to enrollment and annually . Participants who consent for sub - studies may undergo additional blood draws and mucosal sampling every six months and following immunizations and / or illness . Blood volumes collected differ by participant age . We collect approximately 5 mL from children < 13 years of age , and 20 mL from participants 13 years of age and older . For participants unable to provide a venous blood draw , the use of a Tasso ( Tasso , Inc . ) home blood collection device is under consideration . 33 All samples are logged into REDCap using a blood sample collection form . Serum specimens are divided into aliquots labeled with the participant ID and an aliquot ID unique to each tube . At KPNW serum samples are temporarily stored at 4 o C for up to 72 hours and subsequently stored in a - 20 o C or colder freezer prior to being shipped to UW laboratory . At UW or SCH , specimens are kept in a 4 o C refrigerator for up to 96 hours at the clinical collection site and subsequently transported to the UW laboratory on wet ice by a courier service or by study staff . These samples are then aliquoted and stored at – 20 o C or colder in a temperature - monitored freezer until serologic testing is performed . After testing , residual specimens are stored at - 20°C or colder for long - term storage , and possible additional future testing in individuals in whom consent was obtained for additional testing .

A WHO standard will be included as part of these assays for standardization against an international standard . Additional assays that may be performed in a subset of samples include influenza hemagglutinin inhibition assays , RSV neutralization assays and ELISAs , cytokine assays , flow cytometry and cytokine multiplex assays for characterization of the B and T - cell repertoire , as well as SARS - CoV - 2 pseudovirus neutralization assays for VOCs and wild - type neutralization assays . Participant Retention Participants are allowed to pause weekly study activities for reasons such as family event or vacations , by notifying study staff . Text messages , emails , and phone calls that encourage participation are implemented at determined time intervals if participants do not complete weekly swabbing and symptom surveys for more than 2 consecutive weeks without notifying study staff . After five weeks of non - compliance with weekly swabbing and subsequent lack of response to study retention outreach , participants will be withdrawn from the study . Participants may be reenrolled if a future response is received . Patient and Public involvement Participants can provide feedback throughout the study .

They are compensated on a monthly basis , based on the completion of weekly swab collection and surveys . Participants receive further compensation for completing illness swab series and for visits for blood collection . Data Analysis Vaccine Effectiveness For the VE objectives , Cox regression models will be used to estimate the hazard ratio associated with SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination , controlling for important demographic factors and potential confounders . COVID - 19 VE will be calculated as : VE = ( 1 - HR ) * 100 Cox regression models are well suited to account for censored person - time ( as subjects disenroll ) and time - varying exposures ( as subjects become vaccinated or infected ) . Household - level clustering will be accounted for if more than one participant from the same household is enrolled in the study . VE will be estimated separately for the effectiveness in preventing symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( defined by presence of symptoms and detection of SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR ) and asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . VE will also be estimated for preventing medically attended SARS - CoV - 2 infection ; however , it for use under a CC0 license . This article is a US Government work .

The effect of the following covariates on VE estimates will be considered for all outcomes : socio - demographic characteristics ( e . g . , age , sex , race , and ethnicity ) , exposures ( school , day care , extracurriculars , social ) , study site , percent of other household members vaccinated , and community - level circulation of the virus . Stratified analyses will be conducted to estimate VE by age group , prior infection at enrollment ( using seropositivity and self - reported infections ) , vaccine product , vaccine doses ( primary series and boosters ) , and other factors , including time since last vaccination and prior infection . We acknowledge that this study is underpowered for pediatric VE and we will be exploring combining data with other CDC VE studies . Incidence Objectives The crude incidence rate will be calculated as the ratio of the number of SARS - CoV - 2 infections divided by the total person - time contributed by all study participants during the follow - up period . Participants’ person - time will be censored at the time of first infection during the follow - up period or loss from cohort . The 95 % confidence interval will be estimated assuming a Poisson distribution . Incidence will be presented overall , and separately , for symptomatic and asymptomatic laboratory confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 . Incidence will also be stratified by vaccination status , age , sex , race and ethnicity , history of prior infection , and other important risk factors . Funding permitted ; the crude incidence rate will be calculated for other respiratory viruses .

Events determined by the principal investigators to meet reporting criteria are submitted to the IRB . RESULTS The study enrollment period began in June 2022 and enrollment is on - going . As of December 8 , 2022 , we have enrolled 2 , 047 persons from 788 households . Of enrolled participants , 59 % of participants identify as female and 7 % as Hispanic . Of the participants , 73 % identify as White , 7 % Asian , 2 % Black / African American , 0 . 3 % American Indian / Alaska Native , 0 . 1 % Hawaiian / Pacific Islander , 9 % multiple races , 1 % other and 1 % unknown . The majority of enrolled participants are adults 18 - 49 years ( 52 % ) followed by 5 - 11 years ( 26 % ) , 12 - 17 years ( 14 % ) , 2 - 4 years ( 6 % ) , and 6 mos - 1 year ( 2 % ) . DISCUSSION The CASCADIA study is enrolling participants in order to estimate the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection and real - world COVID - 19 VE in children and adults . Additionally , our study allows for the evaluation of humoral immune response following vaccination and infection , estimation of household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in children and adults , and monitoring of the evolution of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus by genomic sequencing . for use under a CC0 license .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 7 , 2023 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2023 . 01 . 05 . 22283913 doi : medRxiv preprint This study design has several strengths . The CASCADIA study uses a remote web - based survey model which allows for access to a larger population and captures sociodemographic , clinical and behavioral characteristics of persons before , during , and after a respiratory illness from SARS - CoV - 2 . The surveys are designed to collect comprehensive data but are not time consuming for participants . The four - year study design and collection of weekly respiratory samples will allow us a standardized methodology for capturing our primary outcome of VE , including both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection . This study allows for the collection of data regarding community - based transmission among children and adults in persons who might not have otherwise sought medical care or testing . Weekly nasal swab collection captures pre - symptomatic , symptomatic , and asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Additionally , the inclusion of blood specimens will allow us to assess the kinetics and durability of immune response following infection and vaccination . By using multiplex molecular testing , immunity to variants of SARS - CoV - 2 will be assessed . This assay was used previously to recognize community transmission in the beginning of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic in the United States . 34 35 Genomic sequencing of SARS - CoV - 2 will provide information about circulating variants strains , intra - patient virus evolution , and changes in household or community transmission patterns . The rotating design of the monthly surveys allows for flexibility in data collection which may change as the study progresses . In studies evaluating vaccine effectiveness in the pediatric population , medical care and symptomatic infection are typical endpoints . 36 37 38 39 40 The CASCADIA study will collect longitudinal information in a pediatric and adult cohort using a weekly swabbing study design to evaluate the clinical spectrum SARS - CoV - 2 infection , spanning asymptomatic viral shedding to severe disease . The prospective design and active surveillance within the study allows for the identification of risk factors leading to symptomatic and asymptomatic infection . This study has limitations . Given the study design , a selection bias of pro - medical and vaccinated persons will likely occur . Enrollment of persons with distrust of the medical community may be difficult for use under a CC0 license . This article is a US Government work .

The web - based survey design may introduce selection bias and limit generalizability . Recruitment efforts will be adapted throughout the enrollment period to ensure a diversity of study participants . Given the longitudinal nature of the study , retention and consistency will need to be monitored and carefully maintained . Annual blood collection may be a limitation for child participants and if a hinderance to enrollment , this mandatory requirement may require re - consideration . Additional blood collection methods such as a Tasso ( Tasso , Inc . ) home blood collection device is being explored . 33 In conclusion , this study design allows for large population surveillance of SARS - CoV - 2 and other respiratory viruses with a predominantly remote , web - based structure to inform on real world vaccine effectiveness in children and adults .
