The magnitude and trend in the incidence of COVID - 19 is one way to monitor the course of the epidemic . The diagnosed COVID - 19 cases are a subset of the infections and therefore the COVID - 19 incidence underestimates the SARS - CoV - 2 incidence . The likelihood that an individual with SARS - CoV - 2 infection is diagnosed with COVID - 19 depends on the clinical manifestation as well as the infection testing policy and capacity . These factors may fluctuate over time and the underreporting of infections changes accordingly . Quantifying the extent of underreporting allows the assessment of the true incidence of infection . To obtain information on the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Finland , a series of serological surveys was initiated in April 2020 . We develop a Bayesian inference approach and apply it to data from the serological surveys , registered COVID - 19 cases , and external data , to estimate the time - dependent underreporting of SARS - Cov - 2 infections during the first wave of the COVID - 19 14th February 2023 1 / 35 .

There were 1 to 5 ( 95 % probability ) SARS - CoV - 2 infections for every COVID - 19 case during the first wave of the COVID - 19 epidemic in Finland . The underreporting was highest before April when there were 4 to 17 ( 95 % probability ) infections for every COVID - 19 case . It is likely that between 0 . 5 % – 1 . 0 % ( 50 % probability ) and no more than 1 . 5 % ( 95 % probability ) of the population in the extended capital region were infected with SARS - CoV - 2 by the beginning of July 2020 . Introduction 1 When a novel virus initiates an epidemic , an important question is how fast the virus 2 spreads in the population . If the virus causes clinical disease , the rate of epidemic 3 growth can be monitored by the incidence of diagnosed disease cases . However , mild or 4 asymptomatic infections may be difficult or impossible to observe directly , and therefore 5 the true incidence of infection can not be learned solely based on the diagnosed cases . 6 Infection usually leaves a mark in the form of antibodies , i . e . immunoglobulin proteins 7 developed by the immune system and capable of identifying and neutralising the virus . 8 Consequently , the true incidence of infection can be learned through serological surveys , 9 i . e . studies of the prevalence of individuals with antibodies ( seroprevalence ) . Comparing 10 the seroprevalence to the cumulative incidence of diagnosed cases allows one to learn 11 about the underreporting of infections , which consequently allows monitoring the true 12 spread of the virus . 13 There are challenges in estimating the underreporting . The rate of infections and 14 diagnostic practises may quickly change , and there may be different delays from 15 infection to disease onset and to developing antibodies . In this case study , we propose a 16 Bayesian approach for estimating the time - dependent underreporting of infections 17 during the beginning of an epidemic and we apply our method to data from the 2020 18 COVID - 19 epidemic in Finland . In our analysis we integrate three data sources : series of 19 serological surveys , registered disease cases , and external data on antibody development . 20 In Finland , the first wave of the COVID - 19 epidemic caused by the severe acute 21 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) occurred from March through June 22 2020 . In early March , tens of weekly COVID - 19 cases were diagnosed in the extended 23 capital region of Helsinki and Uusimaa ( HUS area ) with a population of 1 . 7 million , 24 14th February 2023 2 / 35 .

Fig 1 shows the numbers of COVID - 19 cases by 26 week and municipality in the HUS area . Already by mid March , hundreds of weekly 27 cases were diagnosed . The rate of new cases started to decline in early April , most likely 28 because of a partial lockdown in the country . By mid June , the rate of weekly cases , 29 both in the HUS area and the country as a whole , reduced to the tens of cases , and the 30 first wave of the COVID - 19 epidemic ended by the end of June . A total of 7286 31 COVID - 19 cases were diagnosed during the first epidemic wave , of which 5347 cases 32 were diagnosed in individuals residing in the HUS area . 33 The clinical manifestations of SARS - CoV - 2 infection range from asymptomatic to 34 severe and potentially fatal disease . To be diagnosed as a COVID - 19 case , a 35 SARS - CoV - 2 infection needs to be laboratory confirmed or , alternatively , a clinical 36 diagnosis of COVID - 19 made by a medical doctor . The likelihood of a SARS - CoV - 2 37 infection being detected thus depends on the clinical manifestation as well as the 38 infection testing policy and capacity at the time of infection . 39 It is likely that a relatively large proportion of infections went undetected during the 40 first wave of the epidemic in Finland . No widespread testing of asymptomatic 41 individuals was in place , making it probable that at least almost all asymptomatic 42 infections were missed . Many symptomatic infections were likely missed as well due to 43 the care instructions and testing policy in place . In Finland , the underreporting was 44 probably most prominent among the young and healthy in the beginning of the first 45 epidemic wave , when the official care instructions for healthy individuals with 46 symptoms compatible with COVID - 19 were to stay at home with no contact to health 47 care [ 1 ] . These instructions were affected by the limited infection testing capacity . 48 During the epidemic peak , the daily number of infection tests in the HUS area was still 49 increasing through rapid capacity building . The daily testing capacity increased from 50 approximately 300 during March to 1000 during April to 1500 tests from May 51 onward [ 2 ] . 52 Based on a population - based seroepidemiological study in Spain in April - May 2020 , 53 Polland et al . found that approximately one third of SARS - CoV - 2 infections were 54 asymptomatic and that a substantial proportion of symptomatic infections also went 55 undetected [ 3 ] .

Erikstrup et al . analysed blood donation data 58 in April - May 2020 in Denmark and estimated that the ratio of the expected number of 59 seropositives to the number of COVID - 19 cases was between 7 – 20 [ 5 ] . To obtain 60 information on the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Finland , a series of serological 61 surveys was initiated in April 2020 ( serosurveys ) . 62 While there may be significant delays from SARS - CoV - 2 infection until developing 63 detectable antibodies , i . e . until seroconversion , the symptoms and diagnosis of 64 COVID - 19 usually occur with less delay . This means that the two sources of 65 observations are not directly comparable at any given time . One solution to this 66 problem is to compare the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence to the cumulative incidence of 67 COVID - 19 from 2 - 3 weeks ago , thus accounting for the average delay in developing 68 antibodies after COVID - 19 symptoms . This approach can provide an estimate of 69 underreporting , but it does not take into account the uncertainty and individual - level 70 variation in the time lag from COVID - 19 symptoms to seroconversion . 71 To better address the delays in antibody responses , we utilise previously published 72 data about the time lag from COVID - 19 symptom onset to seroconversion [ 6 ] . We 73 estimate the distribution of the time lag and project the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence 74 based on the COVID - 19 incidence . We then estimate the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence 75 based on the observations from the series of serosurveys . Finally , we compare the 76 seroprevalence projections with the estimated seroprevalences over time and learn the 77 time - evolving underreporting of SARS - CoV - 2 infections based on the ratio of the two 78 measures of seroprevalence . 79 We utilise Bayesian inference and data from the extended capital region in Finland 80 ( HUS area ) to carry out the analysis . The novelty of our methodology is in accounting 81 for the uncertainty in the time lag from disease symptoms to seroconversion when 82 estimating the time - evolving underreporting of infections . Our analysis shows how the 83 underreporting of SARS - CoV - 2 infections evolved over time during the first epidemic 84 wave in Finland . 85 14th February 2023 4 / 35 .

We utilised 89 the Finnish Population Information System ( PIS ) to retrieve the native languages of all 90 COVID - 19 cases and the serological survey participants . We also retrieved the age 91 distribution of the study population from the same system . The PIS includes the 92 Finnish personal identity code , birth date , native language and municipality of residence 93 for all Finnish residents [ 7 ] . We present some data for the whole HUS area population , 94 but our main analysis is based on data from the study population . 95 COVID - 19 cases 96 The Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register ( FNIDR ) collects individual - level 97 data on patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 [ 8 ] . These data consist of COVID - 19 cases 98 notified as either a positive SARS - CoV - 2 finding from a microbiological laboratory or a 99 clinical diagnosis by a medical doctor . Approximately 95 % of the COVID - 19 cases 100 during the first epidemic wave in Finland were based on a positive SARS - CoV - 2 finding 101 from a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test . The data was extracted for analysis on 102 31st November 2021 . 103 The sample date of each positive PCR test and / or a doctor’s diagnosis is recorded in 104 the FNIDR along with information regarding the patient , including the Finnish 105 personal identity code . Notifications related to the same patient during a 12 - month 106 period are combined as a single COVID - 19 case . In our analysis , the COVID - 19 107 diagnosis date is taken to be the first positive PCR sample date or the first doctor’s 108 diagnosis date , whichever occurred first . In the capital city ( Helsinki ) , the average 109 number of days from symptom onset to COVID - 19 diagnosis was close to 6 days in 110 March 2020 , close to 4 days in April and close to 3 days in May ( data not shown ) . 111 14th February 2023 5 / 35 .

Each survey targeted most of the largest municipalities in Finland and 116 individuals aged 18 – 69 . In each survey round , individuals were randomly sampled from 117 PIS and invited to participate . Successive surveys were conducted weekly or biweekly . 118 Figure 2 shows the recruitment to and participation in the surveys in the HUS area 119 during the spring 2020 . Due to practical reasons , only Finnish speaking individuals were 120 recruited during the first two weeks , after which the study expanded to cover 121 individuals with native language Swedish , English or Russian . The questionnaire was 122 translated to each language . Other language groups were included in June 2020 . The 123 recruitment targeted only few of the largest municipalities during the first two weeks 124 and then expanded to cover all municipalities in the HUS area . The sample size in the 125 HUS area decreased after the second week and the participation rate declined from 64 % 126 to 50 % during spring 2020 . 127 The age distribution of the study population and the survey participants during the 128 first epidemic wave are shown in Fig S2 . The median and the 25 % quantile of the age of 129 the survey participants were slightly higher than in the study population , indicating 130 that the participation rate was higher in older age groups . Otherwise the age 131 distribution of the participants was similar to the study population . 132 Participation in the survey included giving a blood sample . The first and last blood 133 samples during the first epidemic wave were taken on 9th April 2020 and 3rd July 2020 , 134 respectively . 135 Laboratory methods 136 Blood samples from the serosurvey participants were analysed using a two stage 137 procedure : ( 1 ) a screening test , and ( 2 ) a microneutralisation test ( MNT ) following a 138 positive result at stage ( 1 ) . The screening test was a bead - based fluorescence 139 immunoassay that measures IgG antibodies to the SARS - CoV - 2 nucleoprotein [ 10 ] . The 140 MNT is a cytopatic effect - based test , which measures the capacity of neutralising 141 14th February 2023 6 / 35 .

MNT was used as the second test as 145 it is highly specific to SARS - CoV - 2 [ 11 ] , [ 10 ] . Obtaining positive results from the two 146 tests , the screening test and the MNT combined , was considered a confirmed presence 147 of antibodies due to a past or ongoing SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( seroconversion ) . In the 148 following , the combined test is referred to as the confirmation test . 149 In order to maximise accuracy , the confirmation test was calibrated utilising data 150 unrelated to the surveys [ 10 ] . The ground truth for a past or ongoing SARS - CoV - 2 151 infection was based on a positive PCR test close to 30 days prior to the antibody tests . 152 The ground truth of no SARS - Cov - 2 was based on blood samples from 2019 . Based on 153 calibration , a sample was considered positive for the screening test if the mean 154 fluorescent intensity ( MFI ) value of the test was above 500 . In the MNT , neutralising 155 antibodies were detected from 2 - fold serially diluted serum samples starting from 156 dilution 1 : 4 . Based on calibration , a titer of ≥ 4 was considered positive . Fig S3 157 describes the optimised test performance on the calibration data for both the screening 158 and confirmation tests . The screening test was 100 % sensitive , after which the MNT 159 was both 100 % specific and 100 % sensitive . Therefore the optimised performance of the 160 confirmation test was 100 % sensitive and 100 % specific . The sensitivity and specificity 161 of the screening test alone were 100 % and 97 . 59 % , respectively . 162 Development and detection of antibodies 163 For the screening test , we say that an individual is seropositive if the test gives a 164 positive result . If the seropositivity is due to a SARS - CoV - 2 infection , we say that the 165 individual is seroconverted . An individual may be seropositive but not seroconverted , 166 because the screening test may produce a false positive result due to cross - reactive IgG 167 antibodies induced by other human coronaviruses . Neutralising antibodies measured by 168 the MNT are always due to SARS - CoV - 2 and therefore and individual with a positive 169 confirmation test is always both seropositive and seroconverted . 170 The time from infection to seroconversion is subject to individual - level variation .

If time from infection is long , the antibodies may wane below the 173 detection threshold . The sensitivity of antibody detection ( e . g . the confirmation test ) is 174 therefore likely to be lower than 100 % in both of these cases . When modelling the 175 time - dependent seropositivity , we take into account the slow development of antibodies 176 after infection . However , we omit waning immunity due to the relatively short study 177 period . 178 For symptomatic individuals , the symptoms usually develop sooner than detectable 179 antibodies . Tan et al . present results where symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients 180 were followed for 6 weeks starting from symptom onset and reported the IgG positive 181 proportions of patients for each week [ 6 ] . The antibody test utilised in their analysis 182 was similar to the screening test of the current study . The data are reproduced in Table 183 1 . A total 312 tests were performed on 65 patients , with 3 – 7 days between consecutive 184 tests . At day 7 since symptom onset , only 3 . 4 % of the patients tested positive for IgG 185 antibodies . At day 14 , 50 % tested positive and when 28 - 49 days had passed , between 186 74 % and 87 % tested positive . Tan et al . report that of the 67 patients included in their 187 study , 29 were classified with severe pneumonia [ 6 ] .

Let τ i denote the day of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in individual i , 194 i = 1 , . . . , N . Here N = 1000821 is the size of the study population . The infections we 195 consider may have occurred before the study period but not after ( i . e . τ i may be 196 negative and τ i < D ) . 197 After the infection , on day s i , the individual may develop symptoms of COVID - 19 . 198 Then , C days after the symptom onset , on day r i = s i + C , the individual may be 199 diagnosed with COVID - 19 . In this case , information about the diagnosis and the 200 individual is recorded in the FNIDR as a COVID - 19 case . We assume that the delay C 201 from symptom onset to diagnosis is 3 . 5 days and is the same for all individuals . The 202 cumulative number of COVID - 19 cases by day t is R ( t ) , where R ( t ) = (cid:80) Ni 1 ( r i ≤ t ) . 203 An individual i has seroconverted by day t if t > a i > τ i , where a i is the day after 204 which the SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in the individual are detectable . We define 205 A i ( t ) = 1 ( a i < t ) as an indicator function taking value 1 for individual i if 206 seroconversion has occurred by day t and 0 otherwise . For individuals with diagnosed 207 COVID - 19 we assume that seroconversion occurs after the symptom onset day ( i . e . 208 a i > s i ) . In those cases , we use U i to denote the number of days from symptom onset to 209 seroconversion . Fig 3 summarises the notation and describes the timeline from 210 SARS - CoV - 2 infection to seroconversion . 211 Regardless of the infection status , an individual from the study population may be 212 randomly selected to participate in one of the serosurveys . Let y ( z ) i , t ∈ { 0 , 1 } denote the 213 binary test result ( i . e . seropositivity ) for individual i who was randomly selected into 214 the survey and gave a sample for antibody testing on day t ∈ T , where 215 z ∈ { Screen , Confirmation } denotes the test used to derive the result . We denote the 216 specificity of test z as δ ( z ) = Pr ( y ( z ) i , t = 0 | τ i > t ) . If the test z is not fully specific , i . e . 217 δ ( z ) < 1 , then the result may be positive ( y ( z ) i , t = 1 ) without a SARS - COV - 2 infection . 218 Figure 4 displays how SARS - CoV - 2 infections may have been be observed as 219 COVID - 19 cases or positive antibody test results .

We then project the time - dependent seroprevalence based on the 223 diagnosed COVID - 19 cases , which allows for comparison to the seroprevalence 224 estimated from the serosurveys . 225 Estimation target 226 Under two independent models , the quantity of interest is seroprevalence π ( t ) , i . e . the 227 proportion of the population that has seroconverted by time t , where 228 π ( t ) = Pr ( A i ( t ) = 1 ) = E ( A i ( t ) ) , for i = 1 , . . . , N . We estimate π ( t ) using ( i ) 229 observations from the serosurveys and ( ii ) the incidence of COVID - 19 cases . We denote 230 π ( 0 ) ( t ) to indicate the seroprevalence when based on the serosurveys and π ( 1 ) ( t ) when 231 based on COVID - 19 cases . Our interest is in estimating the ratio of these two 232 seroprevalence parameters on each day t ∈ T during the study period : 233 ∆ ( t ) = π ( 0 ) ( t ) π ( 1 ) ( t ) . ( 1 ) We estimate π ( 0 ) ( t ) and the corresponding ∆ ( t ) separately for data from the two 234 antibody tests but consider the analysis based on the confirmation test as the main 235 result . In section Models we describe an Estimation model used to estimate π ( 0 ) ( t ) and 236 a Projection model used to estimate π ( 1 ) ( t ) . We expect that π ( 0 ) ( t ) gives a reasonably 237 unbiased estimate of the true seroprevalence π ( t ) but expect that the projection π ( 1 ) ( t ) 238 gives an underestimate of the true π ( t ) . We therefore expect that ∆ ( t ) > 1 and 239 interpret ∆ ( t ) as an underreporting ratio , i . e . quantifying the extent of underreporting 240 of SARS - CoV - 2 infections up until time t . 241 Models 242 In this section , we specify the Estimation and Projection model of the seroprevalence . 243 We then describe the estimation of seroprevalence and underreporting under both 244 models . We utilise a Bayesian framework for statistical inference and numerical 245 methods to derive the posterior distributions of all unknown quantities . 246 14th February 2023 10 / 35 .

The Estimation model is used 248 to estimate the time - dependent seroprevalence based on antibody test results in the 249 serosurvey participants . Due to the small numbers of daily blood samples in the 250 serosurveys , we split the study period T into 13 non - overlapping seven day periods 251 ( weeks ) , W = [ 0 , 7 ) , [ 7 , 14 ) , . . . . [ 84 , 86 ] . We assume that the seroprevalence is piecewise 252 constant by week and let π ( 0 ) w denote the seroprevalence during week w ∈ W . 253 We describe the prior uncertainty in the weekly seroprevalence as follows . For the 254 first week , the logit of the seroprevalence is assumed to be normally distributed with 255 expectation µ 1 and variance σ 21 . The logit of the prevalence in any later week is 256 assumed to depend on the prevalence during the previous week with a non - decreasing 257 trend . A shared variance parameter σ 2 controls the strength of the dependency on the 258 previous weeks , with σ given a gamma prior with parameters α and β . The structure of 259 the prior model thus is : 260 σ ∼ Gamma ( α , β ) , g ( π ( 0 ) 1 ) ∼ N ( µ 1 , σ 21 ) , g ( π ( 0 ) w ) ∼ N ( g ( π ( 0 ) w − 1 ) + trend w , σ 2 ) for w ≥ 2 , where trend w =   0 , when w = 2 max { 0 , g ( π ( 0 ) w − 1 ) − g ( π ( 0 ) w − 2 ) } , when w > 2 , ( 2 ) where g ( π ) = log ( π / ( 1 − π ) ) is the logit function . This defines a prior distribution of 261 the parameter vector g ( π ( 0 ) ) = ( g ( π ( 0 ) 1 ) , . . , g ( π ( 0 ) 13 ) ) . We denote the prior distribution of 262 g ( π ( 0 ) ) as p ( g ( π ( 0 ) ) ; Φ ) , where the vector Φ = ( α , β , µ 1 , σ 1 ) collects the prior parameters . 263 The seroprevalence for week w is π ( 0 ) w = g − 1 ( g ( π ( 0 ) w ) ) , where g − 1 ( x ) = 1 / ( 1 + exp ( − x ) ) 264 is the inverse - logit function . 265 The observations y ( z ) i , w ∈ { 0 , 1 } arise when n w randomly selected individuals from the 266 population give a blood sample during week w and a result is derived via antibody test 267 z . The probability that the test result is positive for individual i is 268 14th February 2023 11 / 35 .

We 271 assume that , conditionally on the weekly seroprevalence , the observations y ( z ) i , w are 272 independent and identically distributed . The conditional probability model of the total 273 count y ( z ) w , where w ∈ W , then is 274 y ( z ) w | g ( π ( 0 ) w ) ; δ ( z ) ∼ Binom ( n w , f ( π ( 0 ) w , δ ( z ) ) ) . ( 4 ) Based on the vector of observations y ( z ) = ( y ( z ) 1 , . . . , y ( z ) 13 ) , the likelihood function of 275 the logit seroprevalence g ( π ( 0 ) ) is 276 p ( y ( z ) | g ( π ( 0 ) ) ; δ ( z ) ) = (cid:89) w ∈ W Binom ( y ( z ) w | n w , f ( π ( 0 ) w , δ ( z ) ) ) . ( 5 ) The posterior distribution of g ( π ( 0 ) ) is proportional to the product of the prior ( 2 ) 277 and the likelihood ( 5 ) : 278 p ( g ( π ( 0 ) ) | y ( z ) ; Φ , δ ( z ) ) ∝ p ( g ( π ( 0 ) ) ; Φ ) p ( y ( z ) | g ( π ( 0 ) ) , δ ( z ) ) . ( 6 ) The estimation model is described graphically in Fig 5 . 279 Projection model 280 This model relates to the upper part of Fig 4 ( Selection ) . The model is learned from 281 previously published data on antibody development after COVID - 19 symptoms . We 282 first describe the model and then show how it is utilised to project the time - dependent 283 14th February 2023 12 / 35 .

We assume that each U j has a 286 lognormal distribution with parameters µ U and σ 2 U . The probability that patient j has 287 secoconverted by day u since symptom onset is Pr ( U j ≤ u ) = F U ( u ; θ ) , where 288 θ = ( µ U , σ 2 U ) . 289 To estimate the parameters θ , we utilise data based on patients who had 290 SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies tested on multiple days after COVID - 19 symptoms [ 6 ] . The 291 data are shown in Table 1 . We denote the test result by y qj ∈ { 0 , 1 } for individuals 292 j = 1 , . . . , n q , where n q is the number of individuals tested q days after symptom onset , 293 and q ∈ Q Tan = { 7 , 10 , 14 , . . . , 42 , 49 } . If the test result is positive ( i . e . y qj = 1 ) , the 294 patient is seroconverted and the seroconversion must have occurred before day q . The 295 probability model for the individual observation is 296 y qj | θ ∼ Bern ( F U ( q ; θ ) ) . ( 7 ) We assume that the test results are independent given day q and the parameters θ . 297 Based on the observations y Tan = { y qj , j = 1 , . . . , n q , q ∈ Q Tan } , the likelihood function 298 of the parameters θ is 299 p ( y Tan | θ ) = (cid:89) q ∈ Q Tan n q (cid:89) j = 1 Bern ( y qj | F U ( q ; θ ) ) . ( 8 ) We assume an uninformative prior distribution : 300 p ( θ ) = p ( µ U , σ 2 U ) ∝ 1 / σ 2 U . ( 9 ) The posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the prior ( 9 ) and the 301 likelihood ( 8 ) : 302 14th February 2023 13 / 35 .

( 10 ) The posterior predictive distribution of F U is 303 ˆ F U ( u ) = p ( y uj | y Tan ) = (cid:90) F U ( u ; θ ) p ( θ | y Tan ) dθ . ( 11 ) We utilise the posterior predictive distribution ˆ F U to project seroprevalence based 304 on the FNIDR COVID - 19 cases . For each day t ∈ T during the study period , we first 305 predict the probability of seroconversion in each case i , for whom q i days have passed 306 since symptom onset . We assume that the symptom onset day was C = 3 . 5 days before 307 the diagnosis day r i , and so q i = t − ( r i − C ) . The probabilities of seroconversion , each 308 given by ˆ F U ( q i ) , are then combined as the expected number of cases seroconverted , and 309 the seroprevalence is obtained by dividing by the population size N . Formally , we 310 project the seroprevalence for day t ∈ T as 311 π ( 1 ) ( t ) = 1 N R ( t + C ) (cid:88) i E [ A i ( t ) | y Tan ] = 1 N R ( t + C ) (cid:88) i ˆ F U ( t − ( r i − C ) ) , ( 12 ) where R ( t + C ) is the number of COVID - 19 cases with symptom onset before day t . We 312 call π ( 1 ) ( t ) the projected seroprevalence . The Projection model is described graphically 313 in Fig 6 . 314 Estimation of seroprevalence and underreporting 315 In the Estimation model , the posterior distribution for the parameter vector g ( π ( 0 ) ) was 316 obtained by sampling from p ( g ( π ( 0 ) ) | y ( z ) ; Φ , δ ( z ) ) , see Eq 6 . Each sample was then 317 transformed with g − 1 ( . ) to obtain samples from the posterior distribution of each weekly 318 seroprevalence π ( 0 ) w . This provided samples for each day t ∈ w of the week , resulting in 319 14th February 2023 14 / 35 .

For each posterior sample and for each day t ∈ T during the 322 study period , seroprevalence was projected as described in Eq 12 , resulting in samples 323 from the posterior predictive distribution of each daily seroprevalence π ( 1 ) ( t ) , t ∈ T . 324 Identical number of samples ( S = 40000 ) were drawn from the posterior distributions 325 of π ( 0 ) ( t ) and π ( 1 ) ( t ) . For each sample from π ( 0 ) ( t ) and π ( 1 ) ( t ) , a sample from ∆ ( t ) was 326 obtained by division , repeating over each day t ∈ T during the study period . 327 We utilised the No - U - Turn Sampler algorithm for sampling , which is an efficient 328 Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm [ 12 ] . We used STAN and the R package Rstan to 329 carry out the sampling and monitored convergence via the Rhat statistic [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] . 330 The STAN model code and an R code example are available on 331 github . com / TuomoNieminen / covid19underreporting . 332 The choices for prior distribution parameters and other needed quantities to carry 333 out the estimation are shown in Table S1 . We defined an informative prior distribution 334 for the Estimation model seroprevalence using parameters 335 logit ( µ 1 ) = 0 . 05 , σ 1 = 2 , α = 2 and β = 40 . Fig S4 shows the prior distribution for π ( 0 ) . 336 In the prior distribution , each weekly seroprevalence π ( 0 ) ( t ) has large variance , meaning 337 that for all t there is significant probability of very low and very high seroprevalence . 338 The prior mean and variance both increase as t increases . See section Sensitivity 339 analysis for sensitivity analysis regarding the prior distribution parameter choices . 340 Results 341 SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence and the cumulative incidence of 342 COVID - 19 343 Table 2 shows the weekly numbers of blood samples and antibody test results in the 344 serosurveys during the first epidemic wave .

Results are shown for both the screening 359 and confirmation tests . Based on the confirmation test , the posterior mean of the 360 seroprevalence remains around 0 . 5 % until the end of the study period where it slightly 361 increases . The increase at the end is affected by the prior trend , combined with a low 362 number of available blood samples . Based on the screening test , the seroprevalence 363 behaves similarly but the posterior mean is lower and the posterior variance is greater . 364 In both cases , the posterior mean of the projected seroprevalence ( based on the 365 COVID - 19 cases ) remains lower than the posterior mean of the estimated 366 seroprevalence . The discrepancy to the estimated seroprevalence is greater during the 367 beginning of the study period compared to the rest of the study period . 368 Table 3 shows the estimates and projections of the seroprevalence for selected dates 369 during the study period . Based on the confirmation test , the estimated seroprevalence 370 in the HUS area was 0 . 49 ( 95 % CrI : 0 . 20 – 0 . 91 ) on 9th April 2020 and 0 . 58 ( 95 % CrI : 371 0 . 23 – 1 . 16 ) on 28th May 2020 . The corresponding seroprevalence projections based on 372 COVID - 19 cases are 0 . 06 ( 95 % CrI : 0 . 05 – 0 . 06 ) and 0 . 23 ( 95 % CrI : 0 . 21 – 0 . 24 ) , 373 respectively . Fig 8 shows the posterior distributions of the seroprevalence obtained 374 under the Estimation model on 28th May 2020 . Based on the confirmation test , the 375 interquartile range ( IQR ) for the seroprevalence was 0 . 4 % – 0 . 67 % . The seroprevalence 376 based on the screening test has more uncertainty and the posterior median is lower . 377 Underreporting 378 Figure 9 shows the posterior mean and quantiles of the underreporting ratio ∆ ( t ) ( see 379 Eq 1 ) , based on either the confirmation or the screening tests . For both tests , the 380 posterior mean of ∆ ( t ) first decreases , indicating higher underreporting during the 381 beginning of the epidemic , then settles at around 2 - 3 , and finally increased slightly 382 toward the end of the first wave . 383 Table 3 shows the posterior mean and credible interval of ∆ ( t ) for selected dates 384 during the study period . Based on the confirmation test , there had been 8 . 9 ( 95 % CrI : 385 3 . 6 - 16 . 5 ) infections for every COVID - 19 case up until 9th April 2020 . The 386 14th February 2023 17 / 35 .

The 388 estimate of the underreporting ratio then remained at the same level until the end of 389 the first wave . 390 Figure 10 shows the posterior distribution for the underreporting ratio by 391 28th May 2020 , based on either the screening or confirmation tests . Based on the 392 confirmation test , the IQR for underreporting was 1 . 8 – 3 . 0 . The estimate derived from 393 the screening test data has more uncertainty and shows lower underreporting . 394 Time from COVID - 19 symptom onset to seroconversion 395 Figure S5 describes the posterior distributions of µ U and σ U , the parameters of the 396 lognormal distribution of the time from COVID - 19 symptom onset to seroconversion . 397 The posterior medians of µ U and σ U are 2 . 87 and 0 . 72 , respectively . The figure also 398 shows the posterior predictive distribution for the time from symptom onset to 399 seroconversion . The predicted median delay from symptom onset to seroconversion is 400 close to 18 days and the 75 % quantile is over 29 days . By day 60 since symptom onset , 401 the probability of seroconversion is over 95 % . 402 14th February 2023 18 / 35 .

In 405 both cases , the posterior distribution is similar to the ( informative ) prior distribution , 406 indicating that the data do not contain much information about σ and the analysis may 407 be sensitive to the prior distribution of σ . 408 Table S2 shows estimates of the underreporting ratio ∆ ( t ) , based on data from the 409 confirmation test , using different prior parameter values for ( µ 1 ) , σ 1 and β . Smaller 410 values of β correspond to a higher prior expectation and higher prior variance for σ and 411 in turn higher posterior variance for ∆ ( t ) . For example , comparing choices β = 2 to 412 β = 40 when α = 2 , logit ( µ 1 ) = 0 . 05 and σ 1 = 2 , the 95 % credible intervals for ∆ ( t ) on 413 28th May 2020 are 0 . 4 − 7 . 3 and 1 . 0 − 5 . 0 , respectively . 414 Choice of a larger logit ( µ 1 ) corresponds to a higher posterior mean for ∆ ( t ) , but 415 only marginally . For example , comparing the choice logit ( µ 1 ) = 0 . 005 to 416 logit ( µ 1 ) = 0 . 05 when σ 1 = 2 , β = 40 , the posterior means for ∆ ( t ) on 28th May 2020 417 are 2 . 4 and 2 . 6 , respectively . A choice of smaller σ 1 reduces the posterior variance of 418 ∆ ( t ) and elevates the effect of the chosen µ 1 , but the effects are small . 419 In all cases , the effects of the prior parameter choices are magnified towards the end 420 of the study period , when the number of available samples from the serosurveys is low . 421 Discussion 422 We estimated that with 95 % probability there were 1 to 5 SARS - CoV - 2 infections for 423 every COVID - 19 case during the first epidemic wave in Finland . A 50 % probability 424 interval for the underreporting was 1 . 8 – 3 . 0 . The underreporting was highest before 425 April 2020 when there were 4 to 17 infections for every COVID - 19 case ( 95 % 426 probability ) . It is likely that the seroprevalence in the extended capital region was over 427 0 . 5 % already by the end of May 2020 ( 95 % CrI : 0 . 2 – 1 . 2 ) , while the cumulative incidence 428 of COVID - 19 cases in the region was 0 . 3 % by the end of June . Based on the estimate of 429 underreporting and the cumulative incidence of COVID - 19 cases , we estimate that 430 between 0 . 5 % – 1 % ( 50 % probability ) and no more than 1 . 5 % ( 95 % probability ) of the 431 population in the capital region were infected with SARS - CoV - 2 by the end of June 432 14th February 2023 19 / 35 .

The estimates are therefore sensitive to the model 436 specification ( i . e . prior parameters ) . Accordingly , we consider the most robust estimate 437 of underreporting during the first wave pertaining to the end of May 2020 . We do not 438 expect that the magnitude of underreporting changed significantly during the rest of the 439 first wave , as there were no changes in virus testing policy or capacity . 440 Our analysis leaves a small but reasonable probability that by the end of the first 441 wave there was no underreporting at all . It seems , however , unrealistic that no 442 underreporting occurred , as in the general population the virus testing was targeted to 443 symptomatic individuals only . Findings from a population - based screening in Iceland 444 during March 2020 show that 43 % of individuals who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 445 were asymptomatic and findings from Spain indicate that one third of infections were 446 asymptomatic in April - May 2020 [ 16 ] , [ 3 ] . A systematic review and meta - analysis of 95 447 published studies estimates that globally 41 % ( 34 % - 48 % ) of confirmed COVID - 19 448 cases were asymptomatic during the pre COVID - 19 - vaccine era [ 17 ] . Our analysis also 449 leaves a small but reasonable probability that only 20 % or less of SARS - CoV - 2 450 infections were detected during the first epidemic wave . We believe that this may still 451 be plausible , as other countries show even higher underreporting [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] . 452 A key assumption in our analysis was that the serosurvey participants represented 453 the population of interest . The participation rate was 50 % – 64 % and there were several 454 factors which may have caused selection bias , as survey participation may correlate with 455 the likelihood of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . First , during the first two weeks , the surveys 456 targeted only few of the largest municipalities . These had the highest numbers of 457 COVID - 19 cases , which may lead to overestimating the seroprevalence and thus the 458 underreporting . However , an analysis using data only from the largest municipality 459 ( Helsinki ) showed similar estimates of underreporting ( data not shown ) . Secondly , the 460 participation rate in younger age groups ( 18 - 29 ) was lower than in other age groups . 461 Age is likely associated with the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection due to differences in 462 social behaviour . In April 2020 , Finns aged 18 - 29 had a similar frequency of daily social 463 contacts than those aged 30 - 59 , but a higher frequency of contacts than those aged 464 14th February 2023 20 / 35 .

The underrepresentation of young adults in our study can lead to 465 underestimation of the seroprevalence and of underreporting . Third , in several 466 population health examination surveys , participation rates have been found lower 467 among individuals with lower education [ 19 ] . Those individuals often work in 468 professions where working remotely and social distancing may be more difficult to 469 arrange , and thus they may be more exposed to infection . If those previous findings 470 hold in this survey , this can lead to underestimation of seroprevalence and thus 471 underreporting . Fourth , historically , the participation rate in Finnish health 472 examination surveys has been lower in language groups other than Finnish and 473 Swedish [ 20 ] . The incidence of COVID - 19 during the first epidemic wave was several 474 times higher in language groups other than Finnish , Swedish , English or Russian 475 ( Figure S1 ) . However , as the target population of our study includes only those four 476 language groups , we do not believe that the possible underrepresentation of language 477 groups other than Finnish and Swedish is likely to bias our results . Finally , our 478 preliminary analyses from the serosurveys beyond the first wave indicate that subjects 479 with a past confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection tend to have a lower participation rate . It 480 is possible that those with a confirmed infection were less willing to participate . This 481 can lead to underestimation of the seroprevalence and of underreporting . 482 The median age of COVID - 19 cases in the HUS area showed a decreasing trend 483 during spring 2020 , most likely due to the increase in testing capacity , allowing detection 484 of milder disease cases ( figure S7 ) . It is therefore probable that the underreporting 485 decreased more in younger age groups than in other age groups during the first epidemic 486 wave . Other serological studies have used regression analysis or post stratification to 487 account for differences between the age and sex distributions of survey participants and 488 the underlying population [ 4 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 3 ] . These methods could help reduce bias and allow 489 for the estimation of age - dependent underreporting . We decided not to use such 490 analytical methods due to the very small number of confirmed positive samples . 491 Another key assumption in our analysis was that the time - dependent probability of 492 seroconversion after COVID - 19 symptoms , as estimated from the external data set from 493 Tan et al . , is similar to how the antibody detection in the serological surveys would 494 perform . Otherwise , the underreporting ratio , i . e . the ratio of the estimated 495 seroprevalence ( based on serosurveys ) and the projected seroprevalence ( based on 496 14th February 2023 21 / 35 .

The patients in Tan et 497 al . were all hospitalised and several of them were classified with severe pneumonia . By 498 contrast , the majority of the FNIDR COVID - 19 cases during the first epidemic wave 499 did not require hospital care . Severe cases may have higher antibody responses , and this 500 may cause us to overestimate the projected seroprevalence and hence underestimate the 501 underreporting [ 22 ] . Additionally , the SARS - COV - 2 antibody detection method utilised 502 in Tan et al . differed from the methods utilised in the serosurveys . The serosurvey 503 antibody detection was calibrated to be 100 % sensitive by day 30 since infection . By 504 contrast , in Tan et al . , only 74 % of the patients had seroconverted by day 28 since 505 symptom onset , and accordingly , our seroprevalence projection yielded approximately 506 75 % probability of seroconversion by day 30 since symptom onset . This discrepancy 507 indicates that we may overestimate the time lag to developing detectable antibodies 508 after COVID - 19 symptoms . This in turn indicates that we may overestimate the 509 underreporting during the beginning of the epidemic , at worst by a factor of around 510 0 . 75 . Therefore , instead of 4 – 17 there were perhaps 3 - 13 infections for every COVID - 19 511 case before April . 512 When projecting the seroprevalence , we assumed that the probability of 513 seropositivity following COVID - 19 symptoms is strictly increasing over time . In reality , 514 the antibody levels eventually wane and after 8 months since SARS - CoV - 2 infection , 515 the N - IgG antibodies are detectable in only 66 % of individuals [ 22 ] . Our analysis covers 516 a period of four months , and there were not many infections in Finland before March 517 2020 , so at worst we measured antibodies from serosurvey participants who were 518 infected four months ago . The detectability of antibodies would then be at least 66 % 519 and possibly over 80 % , assuming a linear decrease from the 100 % detectability at one 520 month . By contrast , our seroprevalence projection gives an almost 100 % probability of 521 seropositivity at four months since COVID - 19 symptom onset . This worst - case 522 discrepancy would correspond to overestimating the underreporting by 20 % at the end 523 of the study period . To analyse data beyond the first epidemic wave , the seroprevalence 524 projection should be modified to allow for a decrease in the probability of seropositivity 525 after appropriate time . 526 We included an analysis based on the screening test to demonstrate how our method 527 can be used with tests which are not fully specific .

This implies that 530 either the specificity of the screening test was higher than expected , or alternatively , the 531 confirmation test was not fully specific . The confirmation test utilises a 532 microneutralisation test ( MNT ) as the second test to confirm the presence of 533 SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . Based on an analysis of a large number of pre - pandemic sera 534 from different age cohorts , the MNT can be considered to be fully specific [ 10 ] . It is 535 therefore extremely unlikely that any of our 7 confirmed positives samples was a false 536 positive ; more likely the true specificity of the screening test was higher than we 537 assumed . In our analysis , we assumed that the specificity of the screening test was a 538 known constant , based on a 81 / 83 true negative finding . In reality , however , there is 539 uncertainty in the exact specificity , and the results derived from the screening test 540 therefore have more uncertainty than our analysis implies . For analysing data from a 541 test with unknown specificity , we agree with treating the specificity as an unknown 542 parameter , as recommended by Gelman and Carpenter , and as implemented by e . g . 543 Stringhini et al . [ 23 ] , [ 4 ] . 544 We used a constant value 3 . 5 days as the delay from symptom onset to COVID - 19 545 diagnosis . In reality , the exact delay is unknown and subject to variation . It is likely 546 that 3 . 5 days is an underestimate of the delay in the extended capital region during the 547 beginning of the epidemic , when the average delay was greater in the capital city 548 ( Helsinki , data not shown ) . However , small variations in this delay do not affect our 549 analysis , as small changes in the COVID - 19 symptom onset day would not significantly 550 alter the seroprevalence projection . 551 In summary , we presented a Bayesian approach to estimate the time - dependent 552 underreporting of SARS - CoV - 2 infections during the COVID - 19 epidemic . We 553 implemented the proposed approach to data from the extended capital region of Finland 554 during the first epidemic wave in 2020 . Our results indicate that most SARS - CoV - 2 555 infections were not detected and the underreporting was most severe during the 556 beginning of the epidemic . However , as the cumulative incidence of COVID - 19 was very 557 low , it is likely that less than 1 . 5 % of the population in the extended capital region had 558 been infected with SARS - CoV - 2 by the beginning of July 2020 . Assuming that the 559 underreporting was similar in other parts of the country , the first wave of the 560 14th February 2023 23 / 35 .
