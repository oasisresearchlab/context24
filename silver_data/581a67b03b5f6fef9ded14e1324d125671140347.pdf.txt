These settings have been greatly impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic , notably due to surges in COVID - 19 caseloads and the imple - mentation of infection control measures . We sought to evaluate how such collateral impacts of COVID - 19 impacted the nosocomial spread of MRB in an early pandemic context . Methods and findings We developed a mathematical model in which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coro - navirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) and MRB cocirculate among patients and staff in a theoretical hos - pital population . Responses to COVID - 19 were captured mechanistically via a range of parameters that reflect impacts of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks on factors relevant for pathogen transmission . COVID - 19 responses include both “policy responses” willingly enacted to limit SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ( e . g . , universal masking , patient lockdown , and reinforced hand hygiene ) and “caseload responses” unwillingly resulting from surges in COVID - 19 case - loads ( e . g . , abandonment of antibiotic stewardship , disorganization of infection control pro - grammes , and extended length of stay for COVID - 19 patients ) . We conducted 2 main sets of model simulations , in which we quantified impacts of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks on MRB colonization incidence and antibiotic resistance rates ( the share of colonization due to antibi - otic - resistant versus antibiotic - sensitive strains ) . The first set of simulations represents diverse MRB and nosocomial environments , accounting for high levels of heterogeneity across bacterial parameters ( e . g . , rates of trans - mission , antibiotic sensitivity , and colonization prevalence among newly admitted patients ) and hospital parameters ( e . g . , rates of interindividual contact , antibiotic exposure , and patient admission / discharge ) . On average , COVID - 19 control policies coincided with MRB PLOS MEDICINE PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1004240 June 5 , 2023 1 / 22 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : SmithDRM , Shirreff G , Temime L , Opatowski L ( 2023 ) Collateral impacts of pandemic COVID - 19drive the nosocomial spread of antibiotic resistance : A modellingstudy .

Funding : The Epidemiology & Modellingof Antibiotic Evasion team and the Anti - infective Evasion and Pharmacoepidemiology team received prevention , including 28 . 2 % [ 95 % uncertainty interval : 2 . 5 % , 60 . 2 % ] fewer incident cases of patient MRB colonization . Conversely , surges in COVID - 19 caseloads favoured MRB trans - mission , resulting in a 13 . 8 % [ − 3 . 5 % , 77 . 0 % ] increase in colonization incidence and a 10 . 4 % [ 0 . 2 % , 46 . 9 % ] increase in antibiotic resistance rates in the absence of concomitant COVID - 19 control policies . When COVID - 19 policy responses and caseload responses were combined , MRB colonization incidence decreased by 24 . 2 % [ − 7 . 8 % , 59 . 3 % ] , while resistance rates increased by 2 . 9 % [ − 5 . 4 % , 23 . 2 % ] . Impacts of COVID - 19 responses varied across patients and staff and their respective routes of pathogen acquisition . The second set of simulations was tailored to specific hospital wards and nosocomial bacteria ( methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , extended - spectrum beta - lactamase producing Escherichia coli ) . Consequences of nosocomial SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks were found to be highly context specific , with impacts depending on the specific ward and bacteria evaluated . In particular , SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks significantly impacted patient MRB coloni - zation only in settings with high underlying risk of bacterial transmission . Yet across settings and species , antibiotic resistance burden was reduced in facilities with timelier implementa - tion of effective COVID - 19 control policies . Conclusions Our model suggests that surges in nosocomial SARS - CoV - 2 transmission generate selec - tion for the spread of antibiotic - resistant bacteria . Timely implementation of efficient COVID - 19 control measures thus has 2 - fold benefits , preventing the transmission of both SARS - CoV - 2 and MRB , and highlighting antibiotic resistance control as a collateral benefit of pan - demic preparedness . Author summary Why was this study done ? • Antibiotic resistance is a major global health problem , and healthcare settings are hot - spots for the spread of antibiotic - resistant bacteria . • Healthcare settings have been heavily impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic , in particular due to sudden surges of COVID - 19 cases , the ensuing disorganization of care delivery , and the enactment of infection control mea - sures designed to curb viral transmission . • The COVID - 19 pandemic has led to shifts in the epidemiological dynamics of diverse infectious diseases , but its impacts on the spread of antibiotic - resistant bacteria remain poorly understood , due in part to the largely unobserved nature of bacterial colonization . What did the researchers do and find ? • A mathematical model was developed and used to assess how outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) in healthcare settings may impact patient colonization with antibiotic - resistant bacteria .

What do these findings mean ? • Outbreaks of respiratory pathogens like SARS - CoV - 2 risk aggravating the concomitant spread of antibiotic - resistant bacteria . • Healthcare facilities with greater underlying risk of bacterial transmission are likely more vulnerable to surges in antibiotic resistance in the event of a pandemic . • Limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance should be considered as a collateral benefit of pandemic preparedness initiatives that enable more efficient public health responses to counter emerging infectious threats . Introduction The Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic has impacted the epidemiology of diverse infectious diseases , including sexually transmitted infections ( e . g . , HIV ) [ 1 ] , vector - borne illnesses ( e . g . , dengue virus ) [ 2 ] , and invasive bacterial diseases ( e . g . , Streptococcus pneu - moniae ) [ 3 ] . Antibiotic resistance is a leading global driver of infectious morbidity and mortal - ity [ 4 ] , yet impacts of the pandemic on the transmission and control of antibiotic - resistant bacteria remain poorly understood . There are many ways by which the COVID - 19 pandemic is believed to have influenced antibiotic resistance dynamics , particularly in healthcare set - tings , which face a disproportionately large share of the epidemiological burden of both antibi - otic resistance and COVID - 19 . On one hand , surges in COVID - 19 cases have led to conditions favourable for the proliferation of antibiotic - resistant bacteria , including hospital disorganization , increased demand on healthcare workers ( HCWs ) , abandonment of antimi - crobial stewardship programmes , and high rates of antibiotic prescribing among COVID - 19 patients . On the other , public health interventions implemented to control nosocomial Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) transmission—including patient lockdowns , hand hygiene education , and provisioning of alcohol - based hand rub—may pro - vide the unintended benefit of preventing bacterial transmission . Early in the pandemic , researchers and public health officials warned that COVID - 19 may impact global efforts to curb antibiotic resistance [ 5 , 6 ] . However , epidemiological surveillance has been greatly challenged by COVID - 19 [ 7 ] , and studies to date report heterogeneous impacts of the pandemic on antibiotic - resistant bacteria . One review highlights decreased inci - dence of healthcare - associated infections caused by vancomycin - resistant Enterococci ( VRE ) and methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) relative to pre - pandemic levels [ 8 ] . PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 and the hospitalepidemiologyof antibioticresistance PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1004240 June 5 , 2023 3 / 22 Yet in an analysis of microbiological data from 81 hospitals in the United States of America , infections due to MRSA , VRE , and multidrug - resistant gram - negative bacteria all spiked dur - ing local surges in COVID - 19 cases [ 9 ] . In a United Kingdom hospital network , bloodstream infection due to MRSA and coagulase - negative staphylococci also spiked during surges in COVID - 19 cases , while those due to Enterobacterales reached historic lows in 2 hospitals [ 10 , 11 ] . These conflicting reports suggest that impacts of COVID - 19 on antibiotic resistance likely depend on the particular population , setting , and bacteria in question and may be highly con - text specific . Several international studies have now reported on rates of healthcare - associated infection during the pandemic [ 12 , 13 ] , but few have reported data on bacterial colonization or transmission , on rates of antibiotic resistance among colonized patients , nor on the putative mechanisms driving potential pandemic - related shits in antibiotic resistance epidemiology [ 14 ] . Mathematical modelling is a useful tool to help disentangle the mechanisms linking the transmission dynamics of co - occurring pathogens , especially when data are limited . However , recent work suggests that models describing impacts of COVID - 19 on antibiotic resistance dynamics remain scarce [ 15 ] . To anticipate and mitigate collateral impacts of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks—and potential out - breaks of other , as - yet unknown pathogens—there is a need to better understand how the COVID - 19 pandemic has both selected for and controlled against antibiotic resistance . Here , we propose a mathematical model describing the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and commen - sal bacteria among patients and staff in a healthcare setting . We include mechanistic impacts of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks on antibiotic consumption , interindividual contact behaviour , infection prevention and control ( IPC ) practices , and the size and make - up of the hospital population . Simulations are used to understand and quantify how outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 may have influenced antibiotic resistance epidemiology in an early pandemic context . Methods A nosocomial transmission model for SARS - CoV - 2 and antibiotic - resistant bacteria We used ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) to formalize a deterministic , compartmental model describing the transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 ( V ) and a commensal bacterium ( B ) among inpatients ( pat ) admitted to a healthcare facility , and among HCWs ( hcw ) provid - ing care to patients ( Fig 1 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 is conceptualized as transmitting via exhaled respira - tory droplets / aerosols , while bacteria are conceptualized as transmitting via fomites and physical touch . We assume no within - host ecological interactions between V and B : bacterial colonization does not directly impact SARS - CoV - 2 infection , nor does infection directly impact colonization . SARS - CoV - 2 infection is characterized by a modified Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered ( SEIR ) process among patients and HCWs , with potential sick leave among symp - tomatic HCWs . The bacterium is characterized by ecological competition between antibiotic - sensitive strains ( B S ) and antibiotic - resistant strains ( B R ) . Among patients , we consider exclu - sive asymptomatic bacterial colonization ( C S or C R ) , which is potentially cleared naturally ( after 1 / γ days ) or as a result of antibiotic exposure ( after 1 / σ days ) . B R is assumed to resist a greater share of antibiotics than B S , but not necessarily all antibiotics ( 0 � r B S � r B R � 1 ) , and bears a fitness cost resulting in faster natural clearance ( g B R � g B S ) . Among HCWs , we consider exclusive transient bacterial carriage ( T S or T R ) , which is potentially cleared via HCW decon - tamination ( ω ) and depends upon HCW compliance with hand hygiene ( H ) subsequent to HCW – patient contact ( κ hcw ! pat ) . HCWs are thus conceptualized as potential vectors for PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 and the hospitalepidemiologyof antibioticresistance PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1004240 June 5 , 2023 4 / 22 Fig 1 .

With this model , antibiotics select for resistant bacteria , both at the between - host level due to preferential clearance of sen - sitive bacteria and at the within - host level due to increased rates of endogenous acquisition during antibiotic exposure [ 16 ] .

COVID - 19 responses : Policy versus caseload Ten COVID - 19 response parameters ( τ i ) were included in ODEs by changing how individuals flow through the model or modifying relevant parameter values ( detailed in Table 1 ) . Each parameter reflects a distinct way in which SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks impact the organization of healthcare settings and delivery of care . These parameters are normalized such that 0 � τ i � 1 Table 1 . Responses to COVID - 19 included in the transmission model .

Each COVID - 19 response is further classified as either a policy response willingly enacted during SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks to limit viral transmission , or as a caseload response that unwillingly results from surges in COVID - 19 patients or HCW infection ( see Methods and Figure A in S1 Appendix ) . The model is structured such that these parame - ters have mechanistic impacts on pathogen transmission ( Figure B in S1 Appendix ) . Policy responses are implemented at a time t policy and reflect evolution of public health policy or practice within the healthcare facility over the course of the epidemic . For each of these responses ( τ cp , τ pl , τ um , τ hh ) , we assume a phase - in period of duration t impl , during which the policy is gradually adopted , such that it is implemented with full impact at time t policy + t impl . Hence , for each policy response τ t , the value over time T t ( t , τ t ) is taken as T t t ; t t ð Þ ¼ 0 ; t < t policy t t � t (cid:0) t policy t impl ; t (cid:0) t policy < t impl t t ; t � t impl 8 > > > > < > > > > : where t impl > 0 : Second , caseload responses depend on patient and / or staff SARS - CoV - 2 infection preva - lence , reflecting impacts of increasing COVID - 19 caseloads on provisioning of care . COVID - 19 stays ( τ cs ) and staff sick leave ( τ ss ) impact the numbers of infectious patients and staff in the healthcare facility , while all other dynamic caseload responses ( τ as , τ cd , τ ra , τ sc ) scale dynami - cally with patient infection prevalence . The quantile of the cumulative Beta distribution B x ( t ) ( α , β ) corresponding with patient SARS - CoV - 2 infection prevalence x ( t ) is used , fixing α = 2 and scaling β by the dynamic caseload response τ x .

The relationship between τ x , x ( t ) , and T x ( t ) is visualized in Figure A in S1 Appendix . Simulations Model simulations were conducted to quantify impacts of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks and corre - sponding COVID - 19 responses on the epidemiological dynamics of antibiotic resistance . Sim - ulations aimed at representing poorly anticipated nosocomial SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks in na ï ve hospital populations , as in the first wave of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Dynamics were simu - lated by solving ODEs through numerical integration using the R package deSolve [ 25 ] . For each simulation , endemic equilibria for bacterial carriage and colonization were found . Then , 2 cases of SARS - CoV - 2 ( 1 patient , 1 HCW ) were introduced into the facility , assuming PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 and the hospitalepidemiologyof antibioticresistance PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1004240 June 5 , 2023 7 / 22 complete susceptibility to infection among all other individuals . Dynamics were run for a period of 180 days from SARS - CoV - 2 introduction , using estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 transmis - sibility from early 2020 from a long - term care hospital in Paris , France ( see parameter values in Table A in S1 Appendix ) [ 26 ] . In simulations tailored to this particular hospital , when all COVID - 19 responses were combined with random magnitude , nosocomial SARS - CoV - 2 out - breaks had complex impacts on hospital demography and healthcare - associated behaviours ( Fig 2A - 2E ) , with heterogeneous consequences for epidemiological dynamics of both SARS - CoV - 2 and antibiotic - resistant bacteria ( Fig 2F – 2I ) . To account for extensive parameter uncertainty reflecting heterogeneity across different bacteria and healthcare facilities , 2 distinct sets of probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations were conducted : ( i ) generic MRB in generic hospitals ; and ( ii ) case studies of specific bacteria , hos - pital wards , and COVID - 19 response scenarios ( see S1 Appendix section 1 . 3 ) . Pathogen transmission rates per unit of time estimated from the literature ( β ) were scaled to interindi - vidual contact rates per unit of time ( κ ) to approximate transmission rates per unit of contact ( π = β / κ ) , facilitating generalizability across settings . Monte Carlo simulations were conducted by randomly sampling parameter values from their respective probability distributions , yield - ing a distinct parameter vector Θ for each simulation ( see S1 Appendix section 1 . 2 ) . Probabil - ity distributions for key parameters underlying these distinct simulation sets are visualized in Figure C in S1 Appendix . Bootstrap resampling was used to determine the appropriate num - ber of Monte Carlo simulations to conduct ( n = 500 ; Figures D and E in S1 Appendix ) . Evaluating impacts of COVID - 19 on antibiotic resistance Epidemiological indicators ( Γ ) were calculated from simulation outputs and include the preva - lence and incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , of patient colonization with B S and B R , and of HCW carriage of B S and B R , as well as the cumulative number of patient - days of bacterial colo - nization and the average resistance rate ( the cumulative share of patient colonization due to B R relative to B S ) ( see S1 Appendix section 1 . 4 ) . Multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine which model parameters drive respective Γ ( Figures F and G in S1 Appendix ) . Epidemiological impacts of COVID - 19 were assessed by calculating how COVID - 19 responses impacted epidemiological indicators in parameter - matched simulations . For Θ i cor - responding to the i th Monte Carlo simulation , the model was run both with selected COVID - 19 response parameters ( τ > 0 ) and without ( τ = 0 ) , and corresponding epidemiological indicators were calculated in their presence ( G i 1 ) and absence ( G i 0 ) . The epidemiological change resulting from COVID - 19 responses was thus calculated as the relative difference in each indicator , DG i ¼ G i 1 G i 0 (cid:0) 1 � � � 100 % such that positive ( negative ) values indicate the percentage increase ( decrease ) in Γ i as a result of the COVID - 19 response parameters included in Θ i . Final differences for each indicator are reported as means and 95 % uncertainty intervals ( 95 % UIs , the 2 . 5th and 97 . 5th quantiles ) of the resulting distribution ΔΓ n . P values are not reported due to lack of interpretability for simu - lated data .

In the absence of COVID - 19 , these hospitals and MRB are characterized by sub - stantial epidemiological heterogeneity ( Figures H and I in S1 Appendix ) . Combined COVID - 19 responses prevent MRB colonization but favour resistance When all COVID - 19 responses are combined ( τ = 0 . 5 ) , nosocomial SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks have varied impacts on healthcare - associated behaviours , hospital demography , and , conse - quently , the epidemiological burden of MRB ( Fig 3 ) . Collateral impacts favouring MRB colo - nization include increased rates of HCW contact and increased patient exposure to antibiotics . Fig 3 . Combined COVID - 19 responses impact the behaviour and demography of generic hospital populations and consequently impact the epidemiological dynamics of generic MRB . Each data point represents one of n = 500 unique MRB – hospital pairs . For each indicator ( row ) , change due to COVID - 19 responses is calculated as the difference between parameter - matched simulations including all COVID - 19 responses simultaneously ( τ = 0 . 5 ) versus those including no COVID - 19 responses ( τ = 0 ) . Indicators are calculated cumulatively over t = 180 days of simulation , after introduction of 2 index cases of SARS - CoV - 2 into the hospital at t = 0 .

Combined COVID - 19 responses result in a mean 88 . 1 % [ 95 % UI : 58 . 8 % , 99 . 7 % ] reduction in cumulative nosocomial SARS - CoV - 2 infection incidence , including reductions across all acquisition routes ( Figure J in S1 Appendix ) , but have more heterogeneous impacts on MRB epidemiology ( Fig 3 ) . COVID - 19 responses lead to a mean 11 . 6 % [ − 2 . 7 % , 44 . 1 % ] reduction in the cumulative number of patient - days colonized with MRB and a mean 24 . 2 % [ − 7 . 8 % , 59 . 3 % ] reduction in the cumulative incidence of nosocomial colonization . However , incidence rates decrease for some acquisition routes ( e . g . , HCW - to - patient transmission ) but increase for oth - ers ( e . g . , endogenous acquisition ) . COVID - 19 responses also lead to transient increases in patient MRB colonization , with a mean 4 . 7 % [ 0 . 4 % , 18 . 7 % ] increase in peak colonization prev - alence , as well as a 2 . 9 % [ − 5 . 4 % , 23 . 2 % ] increase in the average resistance rate ( the cumulative share of colonized patient - days caused by resistant bacteria ) . Distinct COVID - 19 responses have distinct epidemiological impacts Individual COVID - 19 responses have distinct impacts on MRB epidemiology ( Fig 4A ) . Several COVID - 19 responses are responsible for reducing the cumulative number of patient - days of MRB colonization , including reduced patient admission ( τ ra ) , improved HCW hand hygiene ( τ hh ) , and patient lockdown ( τ pl ) . However , no COVID - 19 responses lead to meaningful reductions in the average resistance rate , although hand hygiene and patient lockdown are associated with high variance in this outcome despite negligible change on average . The COVID - 19 response that most favours increasing resistance is abandoned stewardship ( τ as ) , which , in the absence of other COVID - 19 responses , causes a mean 9 . 4 % [ 0 . 1 % , 49 . 0 % ] increase in the average resistance rate . This is followed by sicker casemix ( τ sc ) with a 2 . 5 % [ < 0 . 1 % , 7 . 7 % ] increase in the average resistance rate , and COVID - 19 prescribing ( τ cp ) with a 1 . 0 % [ < 0 . 1 % , 6 . 5 % ] increase . Individual COVID - 19 responses also have distinct impacts on the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and MRB colonization , with changes varying across different routes of acquisition . Reductions in SARS - CoV - 2 incidence are led by reduced transmission from all individuals due to universal masking ( τ um ) , reduced transmission from HCWs due to staff sick leave ( τ ss ) , reduced transmission to patients due to reduced admissions ( τ ra ) , and reduced patient - to - patient transmission due to patient lockdown ( τ pl ) ( Figure K in S1 Appendix ) . Reductions in MRB incidence are largely due to reduced transmission from HCWs as a result of improved hand hygiene ( τ hh ) , reduced transmission from patients due to patient lockdown ( τ pl ) , and reduced transmission to and from all individuals due to reduced patient admission ( τ ra ) ( Figure L in S1 Appendix ) . These COVID - 19 responses outweigh the impacts of competing COVID - 19 responses that favour greater SARS - CoV - 2 incidence [ care disorganization ( τ cd ) and COVID - 19 stays ( τ cs ) ] and / or MRB incidence [ abandoned stewardship ( τ as ) , care disorga - nization ( τ cd ) , sicker casemix ( τ sc ) , COVID - 19 stays ( τ cs ) , staff sick leave ( τ ss ) , and COVID - 19 prescribing ( τ cp ) ] ( Figures M and N in S1 Appendix ) . Surges in COVID - 19 caseloads lead to strong selection for resistance Impacts of COVID - 19 responses on MRB epidemiology vary across policy responses and case - load responses ( Fig 4B ) . The cumulative number of patient - days colonized with MRB decreases by a mean 13 . 2 % [ 0 . 6 % , 46 . 9 % ] with policy responses , but increases by a mean 6 . 3 % [ − 5 . 2 % , 42 . 8 % ] with caseload responses . Mirroring these trends , MRB colonization incidence decreases by 28 . 2 % [ 2 . 5 % , 60 . 2 % ] with policy responses but increases by 13 . 8 % [ − 3 . 5 % , 77 . 0 % ] with caseload responses ( Figure M in S1 Appendix ) . By contrast , policy responses have little PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 and the hospitalepidemiologyof antibioticresistance PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1004240 June 5 , 2023 11 / 22 Fig 4 .

Impacts of COVID - 19 on MRSA and ESBL - E . coli across wards and scenarios The second simulation set accounts for a series of case studies representing specific bacteria ( MRSA and ESBL - E . coli ; see Table C in S1 Appendix ) , specific healthcare settings ( a geriatric rehabilitation ward , a short - stay geriatric ward , and a general paediatric ward ; see Table D in S1 Appendix ) , and specific COVID - 19 response scenarios ( an organized response , an inter - mediate response , and an overwhelmed response ; see Table E in S1 Appendix ) . Response sce - narios were assumed to vary in terms of the COVID - 19 policies put in place . For example , in the organized response , we assumed universal masking with N95 respirators , strict patient lockdown , a large increase in hand hygiene compliance , and COVID - 19 prescribing only for patients experiencing bacterial coinfection ; and in the disorganized response , we assumed no masking , minimally effective patient lockdown , marginal improvement in hand hygiene , and high rates of COVID - 19 prescribing . Baseline nosocomial dynamics differ across wards Baseline healthcare - associated behaviours and demography vary across wards ( Figure O in S1 Appendix ) , resulting in ward - specific epidemiological dynamics of MRSA and ESBL - E . coli colonization ( prior to introduction of SARS - CoV - 2 ) ( Figure P in S1 Appendix ) . Due to differ - ent factors including ward - specific differences in antibiotic exposure , patient length of stay , and interindividual contact rates , the relative importance of different colonization acquisition routes varies across settings and bacteria . For MRSA , for example , endogenous acquisition dominates in the short - stay ward , HCW - to - patient transmission dominates in the general ward , and patient - to - patient transmission dominates in the rehabilitation ward ( Figure Q in S1 Appendix ) . Upon introduction of SARS - CoV - 2 , ward - specific characteristics further trans - late to variability in SARS - CoV - 2 risk and infection dynamics ( Figure R in S1 Appendix ) . In both the short - stay ward and the general ward , most SARS - CoV - 2 transmission results from HCWs , with negligible transmission from patients to HCWs or other patients . Conversely , in the rehabilitation ward , patient - to - patient transmission is the dominant acquisition route . Overwhelmed COVID - 19 responses exacerbate antibiotic resistance Impacts of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks on antibiotic resistance epidemiology vary across wards , bacterial species , and COVID - 19 response scenarios ( Fig 5 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks have little impact on bacteria acquired predominantly via endogenous acquisition , including ESBL - E . coli in the general ward and both MRSA and ESBL - E . coli in the short - stay ward ( Figure Q in S1 Appendix ) . For remaining contexts with substantial bacterial transmission to and from patients , SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks have significant impacts on bacterial colonization incidence and the bacterial resistance rate ( Fig 5 ) . Overwhelmed COVID - 19 responses are associated sick leave ( τ ss ) , reduced admission ( τ ra ) , and sicker casemix ( τ sc ) . Small translucent points represents unique MRB – hospital pairs , and larger opaque points represent means across n = 500 pairs . For each indicator , change due to COVID - 19 responses is calculated as the difference between parameter - matched simulations including respective COVID - 19 responses ( τ = 0 . 5 ) versus those including no COVID - 19 responses ( τ = 0 ) . Indicators are calculated cumulatively over t = 180 days of simulation , after introduction of 2 index cases of SARS - CoV - 2 into the hospital at t = 0 .

Overwhelmed responses to COVID - 19 result in greater colonization burden of antibiotic - resistant bacteria relative to organized responses .

For example , given an organized response in the rehabilitation ward , colonization incidence of MRSA decreases by a mean 65 . 2 % % [ 48 . 8 % , 79 . 9 % ] , with little change in the resistance rate . Conversely , given an overwhelmed response , there is little change in incidence , while the resis - tance rate increases by a mean 18 . 7 % [ 8 . 5 % , 28 . 3 % ] . These impacts result from how different COVID - 19 response scenarios modify healthcare - associated behaviours and demography in each ward . In the rehabilitation ward , for example , patient antibiotic exposure and the daily number of contacts per patient tend to increase in the overwhelmed scenario but decrease in the organized scenario ( Figure S in S1 Appendix ) . Impacts of COVID - 19 on antibiotic resistance also depend on the transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 ( β V ) and the timing of COVID - 19 policy implementation ( t policy ) ( visualized for MRSA in the rehabilitation ward in Fig 6 ; see all bacteria and wards in Figures T and U in S1 Appendix ) . Increasing the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rate results in larger SARS - CoV - 2 out - breaks and , in turn , greater selection for resistance across all wards , bacteria , and control sce - narios . However , impacts of policy timing depend on the nature of the policies being implemented . Earlier implementation of organized responses generally results in lower resistance rates , due to their ability to help control the spread of and selection for resistant bacteria . Conversely , earlier implementation of overwhelmed responses generally results in higher resistance rates , as these responses tend to exert additional selection for resistant bacteria . Fig 6 . Antibiotic resistance is mitigated by earlier implementation of organized COVID - 19 responses but exacerbated by earlier implementation of overwhelmed COVID - 19 responses . Each coloured tile depicts mean change in the average resistance rate of MRSA across n = 500 Monte Carlo simulations , which varies with the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rate ( x - axis ) and the delay to COVID - 19 policy implementation ( y - axis ) in a geriatric rehabilitation ward with ( a ) an organized response to COVID - 19 versus ( b ) an overwhelmed response . Change due to COVID - 19 responses is calculated as the difference between parameter - matched simulations including respective COVID - 19 responses ( organized , overwhelmed ; see Table E in S1 Appendix ) versus those including no COVID - 19 responses ( τ = 0 ) .

Surges in COVID - 19 cases— and associated consequences like abandonment of antibiotic stewardship programmes and disorganization of patient care—were found to favour the spread of resistant bacteria . Con - versely , COVID - 19 control policies like patient lockdown , universal masking , and reinforce - ment of hand hygiene were effective for prevention of bacterial colonization . Such policies work not only by directly preventing bacterial transmission , but also by limiting surges in COVID - 19 cases and the conditions favourable for bacterial spread that they create . These findings thus suggest that limiting the proliferation of antibiotic resistance is an important col - lateral benefit of nosocomial COVID - 19 prevention . This further suggests that various other public health strategies effective for prevention of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in healthcare set - tings—including vaccination , mass testing , and HCW cohorting—may help to alleviate the spread of antibiotic resistance [ 28 – 30 ] . Findings also suggest that better pandemic preparedness may serve to limit unintended selection for antibiotic - resistant bacteria . Our simulations tailored to an early pandemic con - text found that patients in better organized healthcare facilities ( i . e . , those enacting more effec - tive COVID - 19 control policies sooner ) were less likely to acquire bacterial colonization and experienced lower rates of resistance than patients in facilities overwhelmed by COVID - 19 . We further found that facilities with higher underlying rates of bacterial transmission were at greatest risk of pandemic - associated surges in antibiotic resistance . In the context of poorly anticipated outbreaks of any novel respiratory pathogen , healthcare facilities that rapidly instate effective IPC measures and maintain stable staffing ratios while limiting unnecessary surges in antibiotic use may thus avoid concomitant surges in antibiotic resistance . However , putting such an organized response into action depends importantly on the financial and human resources available and on the emergency management systems already in place . With hindsight , the rapid global spread of SARS - CoV - 2 and its associated health system shocks in early 2020 revealed insufficient global capacity to detect and contain novel pathogens with pandemic potential [ 31 ] . This has spurred calls for transformational change in international law and governance , and expansive global investment in pandemic preparedness [ 32 ] . Our study suggests that mitigating the spread of antibiotic - resistant bacteria should be considered as a collateral benefit of pandemic preparedness initiatives , with implications for their funding and design . Collateral impacts of COVID - 19 have evolved over successive pandemic waves and will continue to evolve through the transition to endemic COVID - 19 [ 33 , 34 ] . Such variability has coincided with the ebbing and flowing of enforcement of nonpharmaceutical COVID - 19 con - trol interventions , availability of vaccines and antiviral therapies , and capacity and resilience of healthcare systems . The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID - 19 are also in constant flux , due to evolution of intrinsic virulence and immune escape properties of SARS - CoV - 2 variants , and great heterogeneity in acquisition and waning of both natural and vac - cine - induced immunity . Understanding how these and other COVID - 19 – related factors com - bine to influence the spread of antibiotic - resistant bacteria remains a great challenge . Asymptomatic bacterial carriage is difficult to detect and relatively rarely monitored , and interrupted epidemiological surveillance and the reallocation of public health resources away from antibiotic resistance programmes and towards COVID - 19 control have made MRB sur - veillance particularly challenging . In many instances , SARS - CoV - 2 testing and surveillance infrastructure has been repurposed from existing antimicrobial resistance infrastructure , lead - ing to extensive gaps and delays in the reporting of antimicrobial resistance data since the PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 and the hospitalepidemiologyof antibioticresistance PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1004240 June 5 , 2023 16 / 22 onset of the pandemic , and a reduction in the number of bacterial isolates sent for whole genome sequencing [ 7 ] . Further , data underlying the causal pathways proposed to link the epi - demiological dynamics of COVID - 19 and MRB ( e . g . , impacts of the pandemic on contact behaviour , IPC compliance , care delivery pathways , and underlying rates of bacterial coloniza - tion and resistance ) are sorely lacking . In light of such complexity and data limitations , mathematical modelling is a powerful tool to help better understand and disentangle the complex , overlapping mechanisms linking COVID - 19 and antibiotic resistance epidemiology . In this context , our model proposes theo - retical explanations as to how outbreaks of an emerging pandemic pathogen like SARS - CoV - 2 may be expected to exacerbate the spread of antibiotic resistance , and how the timely imple - mentation of effective control measures can mitigate these impacts . Where data are lacking , mathematical modelling should continue to be exploited as a tool to understand mechanistic links between COVID - 19 and antibiotic resistance beyond the early pandemic context explored here . Future work should evaluate impacts across other types of healthcare and resi - dential facilities ( e . g . , retirement homes and prisons ) , nosocomial bacteria ( e . g . , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter baumannii , and Enterobacter spp . ) , and specific medical procedures associated with both COVID - 19 and nosocomial MRB spread ( e . g . , mechanical ventilation and central venous catheterization ) . It would also be helpful to evaluate impacts of variable availability of key resources , including masks , diagnostic tests , personal protective equipment , and appropriately trained medical staff . Future work is also needed to understand impacts of COVID - 19 on antibiotic resistance across entire health systems and in community settings . An international surge in outpatient antibiotic consumption was observed initially in March 2020 , associated primarily with antimi - crobials frequently prescribed to COVID - 19 patients early in the pandemic ( e . g . , azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine ) [ 35 , 36 ] . Subsequently , there was an estimated 19 % reduction in global antimicrobial consumption from April to August 2020 ( relative to 2019 ) [ 37 ] . In combination with reduced human mobility , contact rates , and care - seeking during COVID - 19 lockdowns , epidemiological impacts of modified antibiotic consumption in the community remain poorly understood [ 15 ] . Data subsequent to first wave lockdowns have shown a decrease in ESBL resis - tance among E . coli isolates in France [ 38 ] , and reduced carriage of cephalosporin - and carbape - nem - resistant Enterobacterales in Botswana [ 39 ] . However , more longitudinal estimates from diverse geographical regions and bacterial species are greatly needed . Although few studies have reported explicitly on impacts of COVID - 19 on distributions of antibiotic - resistant strains or serotypes , COVID - 19 lockdowns in early 2020 clearly reduced incidence of disease due to community - associated respiratory bacteria like S . pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and Neisseria meningitidis [ 3 , 40 – 43 ] . Yet over the same time period , intriguingly , emerging data report persistent carriage of S . pneumoniae in the community across countries and age groups [ 44 – 46 ] . It has been suggested that reduced incidence of bac - terial infection may thus be explained at least in part by concomitant prevention of other respi - ratory viruses like influenza [ 47 ] , which have been shown to favour progression from bacterial colonization to disease [ 48 ] . Fully understanding impacts of COVID - 19 on any particular form of antibiotic resistance may therefore require taking into account not only SARS - CoV - 2 and the bacterium in question , but also other interacting microorganisms . For simplicity , and due to limited evidence of a strong association between SARS - CoV - 2 and bacterial coinfection [ 18 ] , our model assumes no impact of SARS - CoV - 2 infection on bacterial acquisition , growth , transmission , or clearance . Yet the extent to which SARS - CoV - 2 is prone to within - host virus – virus and / or virus – bacteria interactions remains relatively unclear , may continue to evolve , and could have important consequences for epidemiological dynamics and clinical manifesta - tions of antibiotic resistance [ 49 ] . PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 and the hospitalepidemiologyof antibioticresistance PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1004240 June 5 , 2023 17 / 22 Our model should be considered in the context of several limitations and simplifying assumptions . First , although impacts of COVID - 19 on hospital admissions are accounted for , we do not explicitly model community dynamics , nor do we explore different scenarios of SARS - CoV - 2 importation from the community . Yet community SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks also result in surges in COVID - 19 hospitalizations and the potential overwhelming of healthcare services and have likely played an important role in driving selection for antibiotic - resistant bacteria since the onset of the pandemic . In the context of prohibited hospital visitation during the first wave of COVID - 19 , staff but not patient interactions with the community—and potential acquisition of both SARS - CoV - 2 infection and bacterial carriage—may further be important drivers of nosocomial transmission dynamics . Second , HCWs are conceptualized here as transient vectors , but HCW colonization can also impact transmission dynamics . In particular , nares are a key site for MRSA colonization [ 50 ] , and chronic HCW colonization has been found to drive prolonged nosocomial MRSA outbreaks [ 51 ] . Further , our model is conceptualized as applying to commensal bacteria spread through contact and fomites , so we conservatively assumed that face masks have no impact on bacterial transmission . However , respiratory droplets may play a nonnegligible role , particularly for MRSA transmission [ 52 ] , so impacts of COVID - 19 responses on MRSA colonization incidence may be underestimated . Bacterial strains are also conceptualized as competing exclusively for hosts , although co - colo - nization is widely observed in vivo . However , exclusive colonization is a common modelling approach for practical reasons ( to keep models as simple as possible ) and due to limited data describing within - host ecological competition dynamics [ 53 ] . Finally , our deterministic modelling approach does not allow for stochastic effects like epidemiological extinctions , which are particularly relevant in small populations like hospital wards . In conclusion , this work has helped to disentangle how nosocomial SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks influence the epidemiological dynamics of MRB . Our simulation - based approach facilitated the exploration of diverse scenarios and broad parameter spaces , helping to unravel the com - plexity and context specificity of such impacts . Results suggest that surges in antibiotic resis - tance may be expected as a collateral impact of sudden nosocomial outbreaks of novel respiratory pathogens but that effective implementation of IPC policies that limit nosocomial transmission can mitigate selection for resistance . Given the persistence of SARS - CoV - 2 trans - mission in human populations and high risk of future zoonotic spillovers of other pathogens with pandemic potential [ 54 ] , investment in outbreak preparedness should be considered a crucial element in the fight against antibiotic resistance .
