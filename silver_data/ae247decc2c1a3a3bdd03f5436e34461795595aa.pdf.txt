Molecular Biology of the Cell Vol . 17 , 1871 – 1879 , April 2006 Cooperation between Snail and LEF - 1 Transcription Factors Is Essential for TGF - (cid:1) 1 – induced Epithelial – Mesenchymal Transition □ D Damian Medici , Elizabeth D . Hay , and Daniel A . Goodenough Department of Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 Submitted August 16 , 2005 ; Revised January 17 , 2006 ; Accepted January 31 , 2006 Monitoring Editor : Asma Nusrat Transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGF - (cid:1) 1 ) has been shown to induce epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) during various stages of embryogenesis and progressive disease . This alteration in cellular morphology is typically characterized by changes in cell polarity and loss of adhesion proteins such as E - cadherin . Here we demonstrate that EMT is associated with loss of claudin - 1 , claudin - 2 , occludin , and E - cadherin expression within 72 h of exposure to TGF - (cid:1) 1 in MDCKII cells . It has been suggested that this expression loss occurs through TGF - (cid:1) 1 in a Smad - independent mechanism , involving MEK and PI3K pathways , which have previously been shown to induce expression of the Snail ( SNAI - 1 ) gene . Here we show that these pathways are responsible for loss of tight junctions and a partial loss of E - cadherin . However , our results also demonstrate that a complete loss of E - cadherin and transformation to the mesenchymal phenotype are dependent on Smad signaling , which subsequently stimulates formation of (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 complexes that induce EMT . INTRODUCTION Epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a fundamental mechanism of development ( Hay , 1995 ) that is responsible for initiating pathological conditions in the adult organism , such as tumor metastasis ( Thiery , 2002 ) and organ ﬁbrosis ( Zeisberg and Kalluri , 2004 ) . This cellular transformation results in loss of cell adhesion and apical - basal polarity , followed by a shift in cytoskeletal dynamics toward the mesenchymal phenotype . These newly formed mesenchy - mal cells will then migrate to speciﬁc destinations based on their developmental programming in the embryo or toward lymphatics and blood vessels during tumor metastasis ( Nawshad et al . , 2005 ) . EMT is most commonly assessed biochemically by loss of E - cadherin expression . Before the shift in cell polarity , cell – cell adhesion must be lost to produce individual migrating mesenchymal cells . Suppression of E - cadherin has been linked to various transcription factors such as Snail , Slug , SIP - 1 , ZEB - 1 , E12 / E47 ( Peinado et al . , 2004 ) , and Twist ( Yang et al . , 2004 ) , which bind the promoter of the E - cadherin gene to repress its transcription . Snail has also been linked to loss of other junction proteins such as claudins , occludin , and ZO - 1 ( Ikenouchi et al . , 2003 ; Ohkubo and Ozawa , 2004 ) . Another molecule that has recently been shown to sup - press E - cadherin gene transcription is Lymphoid Enhancer Factor - 1 ( LEF - 1 ; Jamora et al . , 2003 ) , a TCF ( T - cell factor ) transcription factor typically associated with Wnt / (cid:1) - catenin signaling . (cid:1) - Catenin / LEF - 1 complexes play a key role in EMT as previously demonstrated in colon carcinomas ( Kim et al . , 2002 ) . The Wnt signaling pathway has been established as a necessary component to drive EMT in several embry - onic systems , such as neural crest formation ( Garcia - Castro and Bronner - Fraser , 1999 ) and somitogenesis ( Galceran et al . , 2004 ) . Wnt signaling promotes stabilization of cytoplasmic (cid:1) - catenin through phosphorylation and functional deactiva - tion of GSK - 3 (cid:1) . (cid:1) - Catenin is typically degraded through the ubiquitin proteosome pathway , which occurs via a complex of proteins including APC , Axin , and GSK - 3 (cid:1) . Dissociation of this complex by phosphorylation of GSK - 3 (cid:1) ( through the Wnt signaling protein Dishevelled ) increases pools of cyto - plasmic (cid:1) - catenin , which can then bind with LEF - 1 to pro - mote EMT ( Kim et al . , 2002 ; Waterman , 2004 ) . Conveniently , GSK - 3 (cid:1) phosphorylation has also been linked to proper function of the E - cadherin repressor protein Snail , which is degraded ( much like (cid:1) - catenin ) by the ubiquitin complex ( Zhou et al . , 2004 ) . Other signaling pathways linked to phos - phoinositide - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) can also induce phosphoryla - tion of GSK - 3 (cid:1) through such downstream molecules as ILK and AKT ( Hannigan et al . , 2005 ) . In the absence of Wnt , members of the transforming growth factor beta ( TGF - (cid:1) ) family can promote EMT through cross - talk mechanisms with Wnt signaling mole - cules ( Labbe et al . , 2000 ; Nishita et al . , 2000 ) . TGF - (cid:1) has been reported to induce the invasive phenotype in many epithe - lial cancers and is essential for promoting EMT at various stages of embryogenesis , such as neural crest formation and palatogenesis ( Nawshad and Hay , 2003 ; Nawshad et al . , 2005 ) . Upon ligand - receptor binding of TGF - (cid:1) to T (cid:1) RII , heterodimerization occurs with T (cid:1) RI ( ALK5 ) .

TGF - (cid:1) 1 stimulates Smad , MEK , and PI3K pathways in MDCKII cells . ( A ) Immuocytochemistry demonstrated TGF - (cid:1) 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) induced Smad signaling via nuclear translocation ( arrows ) of p - Smad2 / 3 and Smad4 within 48 h of treatment ( scale bar , 20 (cid:2) m ) . ( B ) Smad transcriptional activity was conﬁrmed by a p3TP - Lux reporter gene construct , with signiﬁcant luciferase activity correlating with the nuclear localized Smad proteins . Addition of a DN Smad4 construct signiﬁcantly inhibited p3TP - Lux activity ( p (cid:1) 0 . 04 ) . D . Medici et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1872 Figure 2 . TGF - (cid:1) 1 suppresses tight junction proteins and promotes a clear change in cell morphology . ( A ) Expression and localization of the tight junction proteins claudin - 1 , claudin - 2 , and occludin were assessed via immunostaining , demonstrating losses of these molecules in the cell membrane within 24 h of treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 . The epithelial nature of these cells changed dramatically into ﬁbroblastlike morphology within 48 h ( scale bar , 20 (cid:2) m ) . ( B ) Decreases in expression levels of claudin - 1 , claudin - 2 , and occludin were conﬁrmed via Western blotting , with nearly complete loss at 72 h . TGF - (cid:1) 1 Promotes EMT via Snail and LEF - 1 Vol . 17 , April 2006 1873 this receptor complex is followed by endocytosis , a process mediated by Rab5 . In the early endosome T (cid:1) RI is susceptible to binding with the Smad Anchor for Receptor Activation ( SARA ) , which recruits speciﬁc R - Smad proteins ( Smad2 or 3 ) . On phosphorylation by T (cid:1) RI , the R - Smad is released from the receptor complex and is followed by association with Smad4 . This Smad2 / 3 - Smad4 complex then enters the nucleus to promote transcription of target genes ( Shi and Massague , 2003 ; ten Dijke and Hill , 2004 ) . Although Smads are powerful tumor suppressors because of their ability to prevent progression through G1 phase of the cell cycle via up - regulation of cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors ( Massague , 2004 ) , they may also promote EMT ( Akhurst and Derynck , 2001 ) . Complexes of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad4 have been shown to up - regulate expression of the LEF - 1 transcription factor ( Nawshad and Hay , 2003 ) . LEF - 1 can then associate with (cid:1) - catenin or reassociate with Smads ( Labbe et al . , 2000 ) , to transcribe EMT target genes ( i . e . , E - cadherin , Vimentin , Fibronectin , etc . ; Nawshad and Hay , 2003 ; Nawshad et al . , unpublished results ) . TGF - (cid:1) also has the ability to signal in a Smad - indepen - dent manner following pathways most commonly associ - ated with receptor tyrosine kinases . Recent studies have shown that T (cid:1) RI ( ALK5 ) can directly bind and activate PI3K ( Yi et al . , 2005 ) . Although the mechanism is not yet understood , the available data suggest that TGF - (cid:1) can signal through Ras GTPase ( Janda et al . , 2002 ) , a pathway that has been deemed as necessary ( but not sufﬁcient ) for EMT in several systems ( Xie et al . , 2004 ) . Also , TGF - (cid:1) receptors can signal through Par6 - Smurf1 to mediate ubiquitination of RhoA , an inhibitor of TGF - (cid:1) – dependent EMT ( Ozdamar et al . , 2005 ) . In MDCKII cells , TGF - (cid:1) 1 has been shown to promote EMT via the Smad - independent Ras - Raf - MEK - ERK - AP - 1 signal - ing pathway , which up - regulates transcription of the E - cadherin repressor gene , Snail . Subsequent suppression of E - cadherin correlates with up - regulation of mesenchymal markers ( i . e . , Vimentin and Fibronectin ) and a deﬁnitive change in cellular morphology ( Peinado et al . , 2003 ) . How - ever , these ﬁndings in no way assessed the potential of Smad signaling in this transition . Our objective was to es - tablish any possible role of Smad or (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 path - ways being involved in promoting EMT in cooperation with the previously described Smad - independent / Snail signaling . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture The MDCKII cell line was acquired from American Tissue Culture Collection ( ATCC , Rockville , MD ) and grown in medium containing DMEM ( Invitro - gen ) (cid:2) 10 % fetal bovine serum (cid:2) 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Fetal bovine Figure 3 . TGF - (cid:1) 1 promotes an epithelial – mesenchymal transition . ( A ) Expression levels of E - cadherin were observed by immunocyto - chemistry in MDCKII cells exposed to TGF - (cid:1) 1 . Most of the E - cadherin protein was repressed at 48 h , with no detection at 72 h ( scale bar , 20 (cid:2) m ) . ( B ) These results were conﬁrmed using a pGL3 - E - cad - Lux reporter gene construct , with (cid:3) 40 – 50 % of E - cadherin promoter activity was reduced within 24 h of treatment , followed by nearly full repression at 48 – 72 h ( p (cid:1) 0 . 017 ) . ( C ) RT - PCR analysis showed levels of the E - cadherin repressor Snail peak at 24 h posttreatment , with a steady decline in expression through 72 h . ( D ) Immunoblotting demonstrated that Snail protein expression followed the same pattern as mRNA expression . ( E ) Additional immunoblotting for Snail at 24 h posttreatment showed that DN Smad4 had no effect on expression levels , suggesting that this mechanism is Smad - independent . ( F ) To conﬁrm EMT , expression of the mesenchymal marker Vimentin was observed via immunoblotting in cells treated with TGF - (cid:1) 1 for 72 h . This expression increase was found to be Smad - dependent , as DN Smad4 prevented increased levels of Vimentin ( scale bar , 20 (cid:2) m ) . D . Medici et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1874 serum was removed for all experimental conditions . Recombinant TGF - (cid:1) 1 ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 10 ng / ml for all experiments . DN Smad4 ( kindly provided by Dr . Diane Simeone , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor ) and DN LEF - 1 ( kindly provided by Dr . Marian Waterman , University of California , Irvine ) adenoviral constructs were added at concentrations of 1 : 100 for 24 h before treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 . MEK1 / 2 inhibitor U0126 ( at a concentration of 1 : 20 ) and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 ( at a concentration of 1 : 50 ) ( Invitrogen , Carls - bad , CA ) were added for 1 h before treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 . Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting were performed as previously described by Li et al . ( 2002 ) . The following antibodies were used at concentra - tions recommended by the respective manufacturer : p - Smad2 / 3 , Smad4 , LEF - 1 , Snail ( SNAI - 1 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , claudin - 1 , claudin - 2 , occludin , E - cadherin ( Zymed , South San Francisco , CA ) , (cid:1) - catenin , Vimentin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , p - ERK1 / 2 , p - AKT , p - GSK - 3 (cid:1) ( CellSignalingTechnology , Beverly , MA ) , (cid:3) - tubulin ( Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ) . Fluoresce - in - and rhodamine - tagged secondary antibodies ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) were used at a concentration of 1 : 250 . Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays Luciferase reporter gene assays were conducted using the Luciferase Assay System ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and its corresponding protocol . All plasmids ( 500 ng ) were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine and Plus reagents ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines . Light units were measured with a Luminometer TD - 20 / 20 ( Turner Designs , Mountain View , CA ) . Assays were normalized for transfection efﬁciency by cotransfecting cells with a (cid:1) - gal control plasmid and were detected with the Luminescent (cid:1) - gal control assay kit ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) . Experimental ( luciferase ) results were divided by the (cid:1) - gal results to provide normalized data in arbitrary units . The pTOPFLASH - Lux and pFOPFLASH - Lux reporter con - structs were generously provided by Dr . Hans Clevers ( Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology , Utrecht , The Netherlands ) . The pGL3 - E - cad - Lux reporter construct was kindly provided by Dr . Shoukat Dedhar ( University of British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada ) . RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction RNA extractions were performed using the RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen , Chats - worth , CA ) using 10 7 cells per sample . RT - PCR was conducted using the Super - ScriptII kit ( Invitrogen ) and corresponding protocol . Samples were incubated with a PTC - 100 thermal cycler ( MJ Research , Waltham , MA ) , with 30 cycles per sample . The following primer sequences were used : Snail : Forward : 5 (cid:4) - CCCAAGCCCAGCCGATGAG - 3 (cid:4) ; Reverse : 5 (cid:4) - CTTGGCCACGGAGAGCCC - 3 (cid:4) ; LEF - 1 : Forward : 5 (cid:4) - CTACCACGACAAGGCCAGAG - 3 (cid:4) ; Reverse : 5 (cid:4) - CAGTGA - GGATGGGTAGGGTTG - 3 (cid:4) ; GAPDH : Forward : 5 (cid:4) - TGAAGGTCGGTGTGA - ACGGATTTGGC - 3 (cid:4) ; Reverse : 5 (cid:4) - CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC - 3 (cid:4) . Samples were run on 1 . 5 % agarose gels containing EtBr ( 1 . 5 (cid:2) l ) and visualized with a ChemiDoc XRS Imager ( Biorad , Richmond , CA ) . Cell Invasion Assays Three - dimensional collagen gels ( 50 % [ RPMI (cid:2) 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ] (cid:2) 10 % 10 (cid:5) F12 , 10 % sodium bicarbonate , 30 % dialyzed collagen ) were polymer - ized at 37°C in 96 - well culture plates . MDCKII cells were then grown to near conﬂuence on top of each gel , followed by experimental treatments . Assessment of cell invasion occurred by adjustment of the focal plane away from the mono - layer into the gel , where individual invasive cells were counted . Figure 4 . (cid:1) - Catenin / LEF - 1 signaling correlates with the transition to mesenchyme . ( A ) Nuclear localization ( arrows ) of (cid:1) - catenin and LEF - 1 were observed via immunostaining within 48 h of treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 ( scale bar , 20 (cid:2) m ) . ( B ) LEF - 1 transcriptional activity was shown to correspond to the previously observed nuclear localization ( A ) using a pTOPFLASH - Lux reporter gene construct , with pFOPFLASH - Lux used as a negative control . DN Smad4 and DN LEF - 1 signiﬁcantly inhibited pTOPFLASH luciferase activity ( p (cid:1) 0 . 024 ) . ( C ) The TGF - (cid:1) 1 – induced LEF - 1 expression observed via immunostaining was Smad - dependent , as we showed that expression was inhibited in cells containing a DN Smad4 construct ( scale bar , 20 (cid:2) m ) . These results were further conﬁrmed by conducting ( D ) immunoblotting and ( E ) RT - PCR under the same conditions . ( F ) TGF - (cid:1) 1 was also shown to assist formation of the (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 transcription complexes by preventing degradation of cytoplasmic (cid:1) - catenin . We observed via immunoblotting that TGF - (cid:1) 1 promotes phosphorylation of GSK - 3 (cid:1) within 24 h . This up - regulation of p - GSK - 3 (cid:1) in inhibited in cells treated with a PI3K inhibitor , suggesting that this pathway is responsible for the associated phosphorylation . TGF - (cid:1) 1 Promotes EMT via Snail and LEF - 1 Vol . 17 , April 2006 1875 RESULTS Conﬁrmation of Smad - dependent and Smad - independent TGF - (cid:1) Signaling To demonstrate TGF - (cid:1) signaling in MDCK cells , immu - nocytochemistry was performed using antibodies against phospho - Smad2 / 3 ( p - Smad2 / 3 ) and Smad4 . Cells were treated with TGF - (cid:1) 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) for periods of 0 ( un - treated ) , 24 , 48 , and 72 h , with nuclear localization of Smads occurring at 48 h ( Figure 1A ; arrows ) . To assess Smad transcriptional activity , a p3TP - Lux reporter plas - mid ( possessing TGF - (cid:1) response elements ) was trans - fected into cells under the same conditions . Signiﬁcant luciferase activity was detected at 48 h , correlating to the previously observed nuclear localization of Smad pro - teins . Introduction of a dominant negative ( DN ) Smad4 expression plasmid signiﬁcantly reduced p3TP - Lux activ - ity ( Figure 1B ) . Smad - independent signaling pathways were conﬁrmed as previously described ( Peinado et al . , 2003 ) via immunoblotting , demonstrating increased levels of both phospho - ERK1 / 2 ( p - ERK1 / 2 ; Supplementary Fig - ure S1A ) and phospho - AKT ( p - AKT ; Supplementary Fig - ure S1B ) within 24 h of treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 . By using a small molecule inhibitor against MEK1 / 2 ( U0126 ) , p - ERK1 / 2 expression was greatly reduced . Because ap - propriate separation of p - ERK1 and p - ERK2 bands was not achieved , we conducted densitometry ( ImageJ ) to fur - ther support these data . Mean density for untreated , TGF - (cid:1) 1 – treated , and TGF - (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) U0126 – treated samples , re - spectively , were as follows : p - ERK1 / 2 : 100 . 724 , 152 . 897 , 65 . 741 ; (cid:3) - tubulin : 209 . 690 , 207 . 689 , 209 . 537 . Similarly , a PI3K inhibitor ( LY294002 ) signiﬁcantly reduced phos - phorylation of AKT . These results demonstrated that TGF - (cid:1) 1 signals through MEK and PI3K pathways ( within 24 h ) , followed by the Smad pathway ( within 48 h ) . TGF (cid:1) - 1 Confers Loss of Tight Junction Protein Expression We next observed the effect of TGF - (cid:1) 1 on the expression of tight junctions proteins . Immunostaining for claudin - 1 , clau - din - 2 , and occludin demonstrated that these proteins were fully removed from the cell junctions between 24 and 48 h of treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 . A clear change in cellular morphol - ogy to ﬁbroblastlike cells was also observed at 48 h , which was conﬁrmed by DIC imaging ( Figure 2A ) . Assessment of protein expression for claudin - 1 , claudin - 2 , and occludin was made via immunoblotting cell lysates from the same time points , showing continuous down - regulations of these proteins within 72 h ( Figure 2B ) . Figure 5 . MEK and PI3K pathways suppress tight junctions , but full repression of adherens junctions and stimulation of EMT are dependent on Smad and (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 signaling . ( A ) Expression of claudin - 1 and E - cadherin was observed via immunocytochemistry in the presence of various inhibitors to assess the signaling pathways that control loss of tight junctions and adherens junctions during TGF - (cid:1) – induced EMT . MEK1 / 2 and PI3K inhibitors prevented loss of claudin - 1 , whereas DN Smad4 and DN LEF - 1 constructs did not . However , all inhibitors prevented loss of E - cadherin , suggesting that cooperation between all of these pathways is responsible for loss of adherens junctions and the transformation to mesenchyme ( scale bar , 20 (cid:2) m ) . ( B ) E - cadherin promoter activity was measured using the pGL3 - E - cad reporter gene construct under the same conditions and showed that MEK and PI3K pathways correlate with expression of Snail . The later pathways of Smad and (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 confer full repression of E - cadherin ( p (cid:1) 0 . 012 ) . ( C ) Cell invasion into collagen gels was assessed showing high levels of invasion upon treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 . The addition of MEK1 / 2 inhibitor , PI3K inhibitor , DNSmad4 , or DN LEF - 1 greatly decreased levels of cell invasion . D . Medici et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1876 TGF - (cid:1) 1 Promotes Loss of Adherens Junctions and EMT Based on the previously observed loss of tight junctions and the clear change in cell morphology , we conﬁrmed loss of E - cadherin via immunostaining . Through microscopy we observed moderate breakage in cell – cell adhesion within the monolayer within 24 h of treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 , with nearly all expression inhibited at 48 and 72 h as shown by immunoﬂuorescence ( Figure 3A ) . Next , we observed E - cad - herin promoter activity by transfecting cells with a pGL3 - E - cad - Lux reporter construct , which conﬁrmed the results ob - served with our immunocytochemistry ( Figure 3B ) . We then conducted RT - PCR to detect relative expression levels of the E - cadherin repressor Snail , thus conﬁrming results previ - ously published ( Peinado et al . , 2003 ) under the same con - ditions . We found that the peak of Snail expression occurs at 24 h after exposure to TGF - (cid:1) 1 , followed by a steady decline in expression ( Figure 3C ) . Protein expression of Snail ap - peared to be nearly identical to our RT - PCR results as ob - served via immunoblotting ( Figure 3D ) . When comparing these results we found that (cid:3) 40 – 50 % of E - cadherin pro - moter activity was reduced during the pinnacle of Snail expression ( 24 h ) . However , full repression of E - cadherin promoter activity was not achieved until 48 – 72 h , at which time Snail expression is barely detectable . We then showed that this increase in Snail expression occurred independently of Smad signaling 24 h after treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 , as no effect on protein expression was observed in the presence of DN Smad4 ( Figure 3E ) . To biochemically conﬁrm that the TGF - (cid:1) 1 inhibition of E - cadherin associates with EMT , we performed immunostaining for the mesenchymal marker Vimentin , which showed greatly increased expression after treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 for 72 h ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . These results were further conﬁrmed by immunoblotting for Vimentin expression , showing that its increase is Smad - dependent as addition of DN Smad4 prevented its up - reg - ulation ( Figure 3F ) . EMT Is Associated with Nuclear (cid:1) - Catenin / LEF - 1 Transcription Complexes Because TGF - (cid:1) has recently been linked to cross - talk mech - anisms with traditional Wnt signaling molecules ( Labbe et al . , 2000 ; Nishita et al . , 2000 ; Nawshad and Hay , 2003 ) , we assessed the potential role of (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 signaling , corresponding to the previously observed Smad signaling . Immunocytochemistry using antibodies against (cid:1) - catenin and LEF - 1 was conducted , showing nuclear localization of each at 48 h posttreatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 ( Figure 4A ) . LEF - 1 transcriptional activity was observed using a pTOPFLASH - Lux reporter plasmid . Signiﬁcant levels of luciferase activity were detected at 48 and 72 h , which directly correlated with the time points of nuclear localization . pFOPFLASH - Lux , a reporter construct with mutated LEF - 1 – binding sites , was used as a negative control . The addition of DN Smad4 or DN LEF - 1 expression constructs greatly inhibited luciferase ac - tivity ( Figure 4B ) . LEF - 1 was not expressed in untreated MDCK cells , but 36 h after treatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 we could detect LEF - 1 expression via immunostaining . However , if cells were treated with DN Smad4 , TGF - (cid:1) 1 could not induce LEF - 1 expression , suggesting that this mechanism is Smad - dependent ( Figure 4C ) . These results were further conﬁrmed by immunoblotting ( Figure 4D ) and RT - PCR ( Figure 4E ) . Because the formation of (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 complexes is un - likely without inhibition of GSK - 3 (cid:1) , we conducted immuno - blotting analysis for GSK - 3 (cid:1) phosphorylation . Within 24 h of exposure to TGF - (cid:1) 1 , signiﬁcant increases in p - GSK - 3 (cid:1) were observed . Because Wnt signaling was highly unlikely to occur in culture and molecules downstream of PI3K ( such as AKT ) have been known to phosphorylate GSK - 3 (cid:1) , we performed the same experiment in the presence of a PI3K inhibitor ( LY294002 ) . Our results demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K dramatically reduced levels of p - GSK - 3 (cid:1) ( Figure 4F ) . MEK and PI3K Pathways Promote Tight Junction Loss , But EMT Is Dependent on Smad and (cid:1) - Catenin / LEF - 1 Pathways Immunocytochemistry was performed for detection of clau - din - 1 and E - cadherin upon stimulation with TGF - (cid:1) 1 ( 72 h ) in the presence of MEK1 / 2 inhibitor ( U0126 ) , PI3K inhibitor ( LY294002 ) , DN Smad4 , or DN LEF - 1 ( Figure 5A ) . We found that claudin - 1 remained expressed in the membranes of cells exposed to MEK and PI3K inhibitors , whereas DN Smad4 and DN LEF - 1 did not prevent loss of claudin - 1 . However , we observed that all four inhibitors were sufﬁcient to pre - vent full loss of E - cadherin within the cell junctions , indi - cating that Smad4 and LEF - 1 are necessary for the loss of Figure 6 . A schematic representation of the proposed TGF - (cid:1) 1 signaling mechanism that promotes EMT . Early signaling through Ras - Raf - MEK - ERK - AP - 1 causes up - regulation in Snail expression . Snail , a well - known repressor of junction proteins , then inhibits expression of claudin - 1 , claudin - 2 , and occludin . Snail also provides partial loss of E - cadherin , thus decreasing the level of substrate for (cid:1) - catenin . Further stabilization of cytoplasmic (cid:1) - catenin is achieved through PI3K signaling . Molecules downstream of PI3K such as AKT phosphorylate and deactivate p - GSK - 3 (cid:1) , which is responsible for degrading both (cid:1) - catenin and Snail through the ubiquitin pro - teosome pathway . Smad signaling , controlled through endocytosis of TGF - (cid:1) receptor complex , promotes transcription of LEF - 1 , an alternative substrate for (cid:1) - catenin . On forming (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 complexes , these molecules will then act to transcribe genes that will induce EMT . TGF - (cid:1) 1 Promotes EMT via Snail and LEF - 1 Vol . 17 , April 2006 1877 adherens junctions and the transition to mesenchyme . E - cadherin promoter activity ( pGL3 - E - cad - Lux ) was detected over time periods of 0 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h of stimulation with TGF - (cid:1) 1 in the presence of the same inhibitors ( Figure 5B ) . We determined that MEK and PI3K inhibitors retained nearly all of the promoter activity , but DN Smad4 and DN LEF - 1 only retained 50 – 60 % . These ﬁndings correlated with the earlier results that demonstrated a 40 – 50 % loss of E - cadherin during the peak of Snail expression ( 24 h ) . These results show that MEK and PI3K pathways , which have previously been proven to up - regulate Snail expression ( Pei - nado et al . , 2003 ) , are responsible for suppressing approxi - mately half of the total cellular E - cadherin . However , full E - cadherin repression was associated with our ﬁndings of nuclear localization and transcriptional activities of Smad4 and LEF - 1 , suggesting that both Snail and LEF - 1 are necessary for complete loss of E - cadherin and completion of EMT . We then assessed TGF - (cid:1) 1 – induced cell invasion into three - dimen - sional collagen gels using the same inhibitors ( Figure 5C ) . We showed that TGF - (cid:1) 1 stimulates high levels of invasion , whereas treatment with MEK1 / 2 inhibitor , PI3K inhibitor , DN Smad4 , or DN LEF - 1 dramatically reduces cell invasion . These results conﬁrm that both Smad - dependent and Smad - indepen - dent signaling pathways are necessary for EMT . DISCUSSION The work of Peinado et al . ( 2003 ) clearly established a nec - essary role of Snail in mediating TGF - (cid:1) 1 – induced EMT in MDCK cells , by demonstrating that the Ras - Raf - MEK - ERK - AP - 1 signaling pathway could up - regulate synthesis of the E - cadherin repressor molecule Snail . Taken alone , these data suggest the transformation of MDCK cells to mesenchyme occurred by a Smad - independent mechanism . However , re - cent ﬁndings of the importance of Smad - dependent signal - ing during EMT and its link to LEF - 1 up - regulation ( Naw - shad and Hay , 2003 ) persuaded us to assess any potential role for Smad or (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 in TGF - (cid:1) 1 – mediated EMT . From our results we established that both Smad - depen - dent and Smad - independent signaling were necessary to drive EMT . The previously described TGF - (cid:1) signaling via Ras - Raf - MEK - ERK - AP - 1 , with peak expression of Snail at 24 h posttreatment , is clearly responsible for dissociation of tight junctions and a partial loss of E - cadherin . PI3K is a necessary element for allowing proper function of Snail , as its downstream effectors like AKT can phosphorylate ( and thus deactivate ) GSK - 3 (cid:1) , a molecule that promotes degra - dation of Snail ( Zhou et al . , 2004 ) and (cid:1) - catenin ( Waterman , 2004 ) . However , PI3K is also a required mediator of Smad signaling . In the early endosome , T (cid:1) RI ( ALK5 ) phosphory - lates Smad proteins upon their recruitment by SARA . How - ever , for proper association with the receptor , SARA must also bind with PIP3 ( which is formed by PI3K ) in the endo - somal membrane through its zinc - ﬁnger FYVE domain ( Itoh et al . , 2002 ) . We established that upon Smad phosphoryla - tion and translocation to the nucleus , this Smad2 / 3 - Smad4 transcription complex would induce expression of LEF - 1 . Because GSK - 3 (cid:1) was inactivated , cytoplasmic pools of (cid:1) - catenin would then associate with LEF - 1 to form transcrip - tion complexes that would target genes necessary for EMT , including full repression of E - cadherin ( Figure 6 ) . Our results provide the ﬁrst model to suggest that LEF - 1 and Snail are both necessary for stimulation of EMT . Both transcription factors are expressed in tissues that undergo EMT during embryogenesis ( Nawshad and Hay , 2003 ; Mohamed et al . , 2004 ; Vega et al . , 2004 ) and have been described to promote the invasive phenotype in cancer cells ( Cano et al . , 2000 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) . However , until now , a link between these transcription factors has not been made . Several experiments have been performed to assess whether (cid:1) - catenin / LEF - 1 can up - regulate Snail to induce EMT , but no such results were established ( Kim et al . , 2002 ; Peinado et al . , 2003 ) . We now see that TGF - (cid:1) 1 initiates the function of these transcription factors through vastly different , though interconnecting , signaling pathways . Although most of our experiments were conducted under the same conditions , our ﬁndings were somewhat different from those of Peinado et al . ( 2003 ) . It was previously pub - lished that although TGF - (cid:1) 1 appeared to induce EMT , pro - tein expression levels of the epithelial marker E - cadherin remained high at 72 h posttreatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 . Also , no signiﬁcant increase of Vimentin , ( perhaps the only true mes - enchymal marker ) was observed , although formation of inter - mediate ﬁlaments correlated with the mesenchymal pheno - type . These results did not present a deﬁnitive demonstration that EMT is occurring . However , our ﬁndings conclude that there is indeed a complete repression of E - cadherin , as ob - served via immunocytochemistry and reporter gene analysis of E - cadherin promoter activity . Also , our immunostaining for Vimentin showed a signiﬁcant increase in its expression 72 h posttreatment with TGF - (cid:1) 1 . These data biochemically support that TGF - (cid:1) 1 promoted EMT in MDCK cells . Although we have now established a mechanism that uniﬁes many of the key molecules that have been associated with EMT , other signaling pathways have been described to induce EMT . Recent evidence suggests that NF - (cid:4) B signaling plays an essential role in this transition ( Huber et al . , 2004 ) and may inﬂuence Snail expression ( Bachelder et al . , 2005 ) . Snail up - regulation has also recently been linked to the MMP - 3 - Rac1 - ROS pathway to help drive EMT ( Radisky et al . , 2005 ) . Other pathways such as Notch ( Zavadil et al . , 2004 ) and RhoA ( Bhowmick et al . , 2001 ) have also been implicated in EMT , although it is not yet clear as to how they can be integrated into the mechanism we describe here . Although we have successfully demonstrated a synergy between four major signaling pathways to stimulate EMT , we must con - sider that this cascade may be cell - type dependent . Observing this signaling mechanism in MDCK cells may provide certain clinical applications . EMT , although pre - dominantly a developmental mechanism , is also a potent initiator of pathological conditions such as tumor metastasis ( Thiery , 2002 ) . In kidney cells , this mechanism is responsible for induction of renal ﬁbrosis . TGF - (cid:1) 1 has previously been linked to this disorder , demonstrating that when the down - stream signaling of TGF - (cid:1) is counteracted by BMP7 , EMT is reversed to restore proper function of the organ ( Kalluri and Neilson , 2003 ; Zeisberg et al . , 2003 ) . TGF - (cid:1) signaling pathways are extensive and complex in nature . The in vitro environment used for these experiments ( isolating only TGF - (cid:1) signaling ) are signiﬁcantly different from that which occurs in vivo . We must also consider that these results are cell - type dependent and would need to be conﬁrmed in other systems . However , the uniﬁed signaling mechanism that we describe with this work should contrib - ute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of EMT . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr .
