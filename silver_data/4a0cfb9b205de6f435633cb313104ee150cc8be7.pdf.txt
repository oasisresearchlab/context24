Estrus is an important factor for the fecundity of sows , and it is involved in ovulation and hormone secretion in ovaries . To better understand the molecular mechanisms of porcine estrus , the expression patterns of ovarian mRNA at proestrus and estrus stages were analyzed using RNA sequencing technology . A total of 2 , 167 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) were identified ( ùëÉ ‚â§ 0 . 05 , | log 2 Ratio | ‚â• 1 ) , of which 784 were upregulated and 1 , 383 were downregulated in the estrus compared with the proestrus group . Gene Ontology ( GO ) enrichment indicated that these DEGs were mainly involved in the cellular process , single - organism process , cell and cell part , and binding and metabolic process . In addition , a pathway analysis showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in 33 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathways , including cell adhesion molecules , ECM - receptor interaction , and cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction . Quantitative real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) confirmed the differential expression of 10 selected DEGs . Many of the novel candidate genes identified in this study will be valuable for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the sow estrous cycle . 1 . Introduction Sow fecundity is an important economic trait in the pig industry . The estrous cycle is a limiting factor for the fertility of sows , and it is involved in follicular development , ovula - tion , and hormone secretion in ovaries . Timely mating is the key to improving pregnancy rate and litter size . Therefore , the characterization of behavioral estrus , including swelling and reddening of the vulva , interest in the boar , and the standing reflex , is critical for mating [ 1 ] . In addition , the control of estrus and ovulation has become more impor - tant in recent years because of artificial insemination . The ovary is an important reproductive organ in mammalian animals and plays vital roles in follicle development and hormone secretion [ 2 ] . Follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) play essential roles in follicle maturation . During folliculogenesis , granulosa cells create the response to FSH and LH and then begin to produce oestradiol . As the ovarian follicle continues to grow and proliferate , the preovulatory stage begins [ 3 , 4 ] . The pig estrous cycle spans 18 ‚Äì 24 days , with the bulk of this time spent in the luteal phase ( approximately 13 ‚Äì 15 days ) . The follicular phase lasts 5 ‚Äì 7 days . During this period , the selected antral follicles complete maturation with other follicles undergoing apoptotic or atresia [ 5 ‚Äì 7 ] . Recently , the high - throughput RNA sequencing ( RNA - Seq ) technique has emerged as a useful tool for transcriptome analysis and exploring unknown genes [ 8 ] . Gene expression profiles during follicle development are complex . RNA - Seq has been applied to study ovarian follicle development of several livestock animals , such as goat [ 9 , 10 ] , sheep [ 11 , 12 ] , and cattle [ 13 ] . The use of the RNA - Seq technique identified many DEGs that were associated with pig fecundity [ 14 ‚Äì 17 ] . A total of 11 genes identified in ovaries might be related to litter size in Yorkshire pigs [ 14 ] . Similarly , a large number of genes were downregulated in large litter size compared with HindawiBioMed Research International Volume 2018 , Article ID 9150723 , 8 pages https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2018 / 9150723 2 BioMed Research International the small litter size group in Berkshire pig placentas [ 16 ] . In the latest study , the transcriptome analysis of follicular tissue in diestrus and estrus from Large White and Chinese indigenous Mi gilts was also investigated , and a total of 2 , 838 DEGs were found in four different compared groups [ 17 ] . These studies have provided extensive insights into the under - standing of significant genetic differences in pig fecundity . However , the basic molecular mechanism of the estrous cycle in sows , particularly in the period of proestrus and estrus stages , requires further study . In the present study , to better understand the molecular factors and their regulatory genes involved in the estrous cycle , the mRNA expression profiles in ovaries of Landrace sows were compared between proestrus and estrus stages using the RNA - Seq technique . In total , 2 , 167 DEGs were iden - tified . GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses showed that these DEGs were involved in cytokine - cytokine recep - tor interaction , cell adhesion molecules , and ECM - receptor interaction . These results provide novel insight into under - standing the molecular mechanisms of the sow estrous cycle . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Ethics Statement and Experimental Animals . This study was reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University ( Lin‚Äôan , Zhejiang , China ) . Ovary samples were collected from three estrus and three proestrus Landrace multiparous sows . The six sows were 28 months old and they were at the fourth parity . The estrus sows were slaughtered at 24 h after exhibit - ing the standing reflex and the proestrus sows at 16 days after exhibiting the standing reflex . The corpora lutea were removed , and then the ovary samples were collected and frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen and then stored at ‚àí 80 ‚àò C . The ovary samples were homogenized for RNA isolation . 2 . 2 . RNA Isolation , Library Construction , and Sequencing . Total RNA was isolated from six Landrace sows‚Äô ovaries in two groups using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , CA , USA ) , according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions . The quality and concentration of RNA were determined by 1 . 2 % agarose gels and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system ( Agilent Technolo - gies , CA , USA ) . Degradation of RNA was determined by 1 . 2 % agarose gels . The concentration and purity of RNA were detected by the Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientific , MA , USA ) . Its integrity was confirmed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system ( Agilent Technologies , CA , USA ) . Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext1 Ultra (cid:2) RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina ( NEB , MA , USA ) . 3 ùúá g RNA per sample was used to purify mRNA using the oligo ( dT ) magnetic beads , and then the purified mRNA was randomly sheared into approximately 200 base pair pieces through the fragmentation buffer . The fragmented mRNAs were then used for first - strand cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers . Second - strand cDNA was synthesized using DNA polymerase I and RNase H . After the fragments were ligated to adaptors , the proper fragments through agarose gel electrophoresis were isolated as polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) templates . The quality of the libraries was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the real - time PCR system . The libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 platform ( Illumina , CA , USA ) . 2 . 3 . Analysis of RNA - Seq Data . The sequences were removed according to the following criteria : low quality sequence ( more than 30 % of < Q20 bases ) and more than 10 % unknown nucleotides ( N ) reads and adapter . Then , the clean reads were acquired . The pig genome sequence ( Sus scrofa 10 . 2 ) [ 18 ] was downloaded from the ENSEMBL database ( http : / / www . en - sembl . org / index . html ) . All clean reads were mapped to the pig genome using HISAT software [ 19 ] . Transcripts assembly was performed by the Cufflinks software [ 20 ] . The gene expression level was calculated through the normalized number of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments ( FPKM ) method [ 21 ] . Cuffdiff 2 software [ 22 ] was used to identify the DEGs between the estrus group and proestrus group using the following filter criteria : ùëÉ value ‚â§ 0 . 05 and absolute value of log 2 ( FPKM ESTRUS / FPKM PROESTRUS ) ‚â• 1 Û∏Ä†Û∏Ä† . 2 . 4 . Gene Ontology and Pathway Enrichment Analysis . DEGs were annotated using the GO database ( http : / / www . geneon - tology . org / ) by hypergeometric test to examine the biological functions and pathways of these genes that were present in [ 23 ] . The ùëÉ value was calculated , and GO terms were considered as significantly enriched when ùëÉ value < 0 . 05 . The background genes were genes involved in the whole genome . Pathway analyses were performed by the KEGG database ( http : / / www . genome . jp / kegg / ) , and those with a ùëÉ value < 0 . 05 were considered the significant pathways . 2 . 5 . Quantitative Real - Time RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) . To confirm the transcriptome sequencing data , 10 candidate genes were selected and validated by qRT - PCR . 1 ùúá g of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using a reverse transcriptase kit ( Takara , Dalian , China ) . The cDNA was used as the template for quantitative PCR by the SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit ( Takara , Dalian , China ) . Quantitative PCR analyses were conducted using the CFX96 Touch real - time PCR system ( Bio - Rad , CA , USA ) . The relative gene expression was normalized to RPL32 gene by the 2 ‚àíŒîŒî CT method [ 24 ] . The PCR program was 95 ‚àò C for 8 min and then 40 cycles of 94 ‚àò C for 13 s and 60 ‚àò C for 1 min ; then the melting curve was run from 65 ‚Äì 95 ‚àò C with each amplification for three replicates . All primer sequences are listed in Table S1 . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Summary of Sequencing Data . In this study , 6 cDNA libraries from two groups ( three from proestrus ovaries and three from estrus ovaries ) were constructed and sequenced . The major characteristics of the sequencing and annotation data are described in Table 1 . After low quality and adaptor sequences were filtered out , we obtained more than 38 million clean reads for six libraries . Among these clean reads , more than 96 . 54 % and 91 % had quality scores at the ratio of Q20 ( a base quality > 20 and error rate < 0 . 01 ) and Q30 ( a base BioMed Research International 3 Table 1 : RNA - Seq data statistics and annotation information results .

There were 76 . 31 % ‚Äì 80 . 94 % of the clean reads mapped onto the pig reference genome ( Sus scrofa 10 . 2 ) . A total of 24 , 217 to 38 , 128 transcripts were obtained from the six libraries , and the average transcript length was approximately 2 kb . 3 . 2 . Identification of DEGs . A total of 30 , 369 genes were detected in the six cDNA libraries , and the FPKM method was utilized to evaluate the gene expression level . To analyze the transcriptome difference between proestrus and estrus stages , the estrus group was compared to the proestrus group . A total of 2 , 167 significant DEGs were identified , with 1 , 383 genes downregulated and 784 genes upregulated ( ùëÉ value ‚â§ 0 . 05 and | log 2 FC | ‚â• 1 ) ( Figure 1 and Table S2 ) . 3 . 3 . Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis . To further extend the molecular characterization of the DEGs , the DEGs were annotated using GO terms in the GO database . The DEGs were assigned to three categories , including biological processes , molecular functions , and cellular components ( Figure 2 and Table S3 ) . In the GO category biological pro - cess , DEGs were involved in the metabolic process , response to stimulus , biological regulation , cellular process , single - organism process , cell and cell part , binding and metabolic process , developmental process , cellular component organi - zation or biogenesis , immune system process , and repro - ductive process . Among the DEGs related to the biological process , the most significant term was immune system pro - cess , containing 101 DEGs . Other enriched terms , including cell migration , cell chemotaxis , cell adhesion , and steroid biosynthetic process , were potentially associated with the estrous cycle . For cellular component annotation , there were 160 DEGs , with the most significant term located in the extracellular region ( Table S3 ) . The major molecular function category was binding ( Figure 2 ) . 3 . 4 . Pathway Analysis . A KEGG pathway analysis was per - formed to identify the pathways of the DEGs involved in the estrous cycle . In total , 1 , 700 DEGs were mapped to 239 KEGG pathways , and 32 pathways were significantly enriched ( ùëÉ ‚â§ 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 3 and Table S4 ) . In the significant path - ways , several main pathways were represented , including cell adhesion molecules , cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction , and ECM - receptor interaction . 3 . 5 . Validation of DEGs by qRT - PCR . Ten candidate genes , including five downregulated genes , C - C chemokine receptor type 1 ( CCR1 ) , hypoxia - inducible factor 1 - alpha ( HIF1A ) , epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EPCAM ) , Inhibin beta A ( INHBA ) , and serine / threonine - protein kinase Sgk1 ( SGK1 ) , and five upregulated genes , seminal plasma protein pB1 ( BSP1 ) , growth arrest - specific 6 ( GAS6 ) , Y box binding pro - tein 3 ( YBX3 ) , O - 6 - methylguanine - DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) , and zona pellucida sperm - binding protein 3 ( ZP3 ) , were selected and analyzed by qRT - PCR . Although the fold change varied between the two methods , trends in the expression of the 10 genes were consistent with the RNA - Seq results ( Figure 4 ) , indicating that the RNA - Seq results were reliable . 4 . Discussion The estrous cycle and estrus expression are crucial for the fecundity of sows . The estrous cycle involves the follicular development , ovulation , and hormone secretion in ovaries [ 7 , 25 , 26 ] . The RNA - Seq technique is a powerful approach for transcriptome analysis and exploring unknown genes [ 8 ] . Currently , the RNA - Seq technique has been performed in various reproductive systems , including ovaries [ 11 , 12 , 14 ] , endometrium [ 27 , 28 ] , placenta [ 16 , 29 ] , testis [ 29 ] , follicles [ 17 ] , and granulosa cells [ 30 ] in poultry and livestock . In this study , RNA - Seq was utilized to identify the DEGs in ovary samples of proestrus and estrus pigs . A total of 2 , 167 genes were significantly differentially expressed in the estrus group versus the proestrus group , of which 784 were significantly 4 BioMed Research International 0 500 1000 1500 Upregulated Downregulated N u m b e r o f D E G s ( a ) Upregulated genes Downregulated genes Nonregulated genes Estrus versus proestrus ‚àí10 ‚àí5 0 5 10 4 3 2 1 0 Ôº¶Ôº©Ôº° 2 ( fold change ) ‚àí Ôº¶ Ôº© Ôº° 10 ( P v a l u e ) ( b ) Figure 1 : Distribution of DEGs .

Ten DEGs were selected and verified by qRT - PCR analysis . GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed that these DEGs were involved in cellular process , single - organism process , cell and cell part , bind - ing and metabolic process , cell adhesion molecules , ECM - receptor interaction , cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction , immune system process , reproductive process , cell migration , and steroid biosynthetic process . Further validations were performed by qRT - PCR for 10 selected DEGs , such as inhibin , beta A ( INHBA ) , zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 ( ZP3 ) , and hypoxia - inducible factor 1 - alpha ( HIF1A ) . Previous research showed that INHBA inhibited FSH secretion and activity in granulosa cells and INHBA gene mutations were asso - ciated with litter size in sheep [ 31 , 32 ] . In this study , the downregulated INHBA gene may contribute to an increase in FSH levels and facilitate follicular development in estrus porcine ovary . It has been reported that ZP3 functioned as the sperm receptor and mutations were associated with number of piglets born alive [ 32 , 33 ] . In addition , HIF1A is required for vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGFA ) mediated ovarian follicle development and survival [ 34 ] . Thus , these genes may also play an important role in estrous cycle , and further research is required to investigate the function of these genes during proestrus and estrus stages . The cellular process , single - organism process , binding , and metabolic process content are the basal process for granulosa cell growth and follicle development in proestrus and estrus stages . Our study showed that some DEGs were cytokine receptor related genes , such as IGF2R . IGF2R is downregulated in estrus versus proestrus , and the abundance of IGF - 2 receptor ( IGF2R ) in granulosa cells ( GCs ) or theca cells is crucial for follicle growth and multiple ovulations [ 35 , 36 ] . We also screened the gene IGFBP3 as a DEG . IGFBP3 is also important in follicle development [ 37 ] . Steroid hormones , including progestins , androgens , and estrogen , play important regulatory roles in the ovary by binding to their specific receptors and activating signal transduction pathways [ 38 , 39 ] . The steroid biosynthetic pathway gives rise to progestins , androgens , and estrogen in the ovary and plays crucial roles in the reproductive process [ 38 ] . Our study showed that dozens of DEGs were hormone related genes and these genes were involved in steroid biosynthesis pathways . Eleven DEGs were classified into GO term steroid biosynthetic process ( Table S3 ) . Among these DEGs , the gene HSD17B1 encoding 17 ùõΩ - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 plays a vital role in estrogen metabolism and catalyzes the reversible reaction between estradiol and the less active estrogen , estrone [ 40 ] . One single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in intron 4 of the HSD17B1 gene was significantly associated with litter size , and these results showed that HSD17B1 could act as a potential molecular marker for litter size in pigs [ 41 ] . Another gene , CYP17A1 , encoding the cytochrome p450c17a1 enzyme , regulates both steroid BioMed Research International 5 GO - standard C e ll u l a r c o m p o n e n t o r g a n i z a t i o n o r b i o g e n e s i s M e t a b o l i c p r o c e ss G r o w t h D e v e l o p m e n t a l p r o c e ss R e s p o n s e t o s t i m u l u s R e p r o d u c t i v e p r o c e ss C e ll k i ll i n g N e g a t i v e r e g u l a t i o n o f b i o l o g i c a l p r o c e ss M u l t i c e ll u l a r o r g a n i s m a l p r o c e ss I mm u n e s y s t e m p r o c e ss R h y t h m i c p r o c e ss B i o l o g i c a l r e g u l a t i o n H o r m o n e s e c r e t i o n R e g u l a t i o n o f b i o l o g i c a l p r o c e ss M u l t i o r g a n i s m p r o c e ss R e p r o d u c t i o n C e ll u l a r p r o c e ss L o c a l i z a t i o n B e h a v i o r S i n g l e - o r g a n i s m p r o c e ss B i o l o g i c a l a d h e s i o n L o c o m o t i o n P o s i t i v e r e g u l a t i o n o f b i o l o g i c a l p r o c e ss S i g n a l i n g O r g a n e ll e C e ll M e m b r a n e - e n c l o s e d l u m e n C e ll p a r t C e ll j u n c t i o n S y n a p s e S y n a p s e p a r t E x t r a c e ll u l a r m a t r i x O r g a n e ll e p a r t C o ll a g e n t r i m e r M a c r o m o l e c u l a r c o m p l e x E x t r a c e ll u l a r r e g i o n p a r t E x t r a c e ll u l a r m a t r i x c o m p o n e n t M e m b r a n e p a r t E x t r a c e ll u l a r r e g i o n M e m b r a n e P r o t e i n b i n d i n g t r a n s c r i p t i o n f a c t o r a c t i v i t y C h e m o a tt r a c t a n t a c t i v i t y G u a n y l - n u c l e o t i d e e x c h a n g e f a c t o r a c t i v i t y N u c l e i c a c i d b i n d i n g t r a n s c r i p t i o n f a c t o r a c t i v i t y B i n d i n g T r a n s p o r t e r a c t i v i t y C h a nn e l r e g u l a t o r a c t i v i t y R e c e p t o r r e g u l a t o r a c t i v i t y M o l e c u l a r t r a n s d u c e r a c t i v i t y C a t a l y t i c a c t i v i t y E n z y m e r e g u l a t o r a c t i v i t y M o l e c u l a r f u n c t i o n r e g u l a t o r S t r u c t u r a l m o l e c u l e a c t i v i t y E l e c t r o n c a rr i e r a c t i v i t y A n t i o x i d a n t a c t i v i t y 0 102 203 305 406 508 0 1245 2489 3734 4978 6223 N u m b e r o f g e n e s Biological process Cellular component Molecular function DEG Background 0 20 40 60 80 100 P e r c e n t o f g e n e s Figure 2 : GO analysis of the DEGs .

The solid columns indicate DEGs , and slash columns indicate the background genes . 17a - hydroxylase and 17 , 20 - lyase activities , and it also plays a pivotal role in steroidogenesis [ 42 ] . HSD17B1 and CYP17 gene polymorphisms were associated with breast cancer risk ; hence HSD17B1 and CYP17 represented possible drug targets for breast cancer treatment [ 43 , 44 ] . CYP19A1 is also found as a DEG , and it is responsible for the aromatization of androgens into estrogen in follicles , affecting the granulosa cell proliferation and follicle growth in the proestrus stage [ 45 ] . In addition , SCAP gene was required for the full steroidogenic response through interaction with SREBP [ 46 ] . In steroid biosynthesis pathways , most of the DEGs were downregulated in the estrus group . A large number of genes were also downregulated in the estrus group compared with the diestrus group in Large White and Chinese indigenous Mi gilts follicles [ 17 ] . These results suggested that these DEGs were activated during the proestrus or diestrus stages . The function of these DEGs in the estrous cycle needs further investigation . Moreover , GO categories of adhesion , including biolog - ical adhesion and cell adhesion , were classified into the top 10 GO categories ( Table S3 ) . The granulosa cells and oocyte of ovaries exist within a microenvironment , which does not come into direct contact with other cells [ 47 ] . An oocyte mainly interacts with its surrounding cells , including granulosa cells , through cell adhesion and connection [ 48 ] . We also found that the expression levels of genes related to cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) were significantly altered through the KEGG pathway analysis ( Table S4 ) . The CAMs pathway is consistent with the enrichment results in the adhe - sion GO category , further demonstrating that cell adhesion may play a major role in the estrous cycle of porcine ovary through different types of cell connections . Previous research showed that most of the DEGs were downregulated in the estrus stage compared with the diestrus stage in porcine follicle [ 17 ] . In this study , 22 DEGs were involved in the CAMs pathway , of which 20 DEGs were downregulated in the estrus stage . CAMs are proteins located on the cell surface that regulate the cell - cell or cell - substrate connections [ 49 ] . Previous research showed that CAMs play vital roles in embryonic implantation and ovarian follicle development [ 50 , 51 ] . However , the function of these DEGs involved in CAMs in the estrous cycle should be further investigated . Furthermore , the results of the pathway analysis indicated that 12 genes , including DAG1 , ITGA11 , SDC1 , CD44 , ITGB3 , ITGA3 , FN1 , and ITGA5 , enriched in ECM - receptor inter - action were downregulated . The ECM - receptor interaction pathways are involved in many biological processes , such as cell migration , proliferation , follicle growth , and oocyte maturation [ 52 , 53 ] . Fifty - five genes enriched in the cell migration GO category were also identified , and most of these were downregulated in the estrus stage ( Table S3 ) . Therefore , we inferred that these genes might play vital roles in the transition from the proestrus stage to the estrus stage . Interestingly , the top two highest significant GO terms were 6 BioMed Research International Autoimmune thyroid disease | ssc05320 African trypanosomiasis | ssc05143 Chagas disease ( American trypanosomiasis ) | ssc05142 Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway | ssc04664 Butirosin and neomycin biosynthesis | ssc00524 Galactose metabolism | ssc00052 Pertussis | ssc05133 Legionellosis | ssc05134 Toxoplasmosis | ssc05145 ECM - receptor interaction | ssc04512 Malaria | ssc05144 Proteoglycans in cancer | ssc05205 Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) | ssc05321 Hematopoietic cell lineage | ssc04640 Intestinal immune network for IgA production | ssc04672 Allograft rejection | ssc05330 Tuberculosis | ssc05152 Type I diabetes mellitus | ssc04940 Chemokine signaling pathway | ssc04062 Cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) | ssc04514 Cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction | ssc04060 Graft - versus - host disease | ssc05332 Asthma | ssc05310 Osteoclast differentiation | ssc04380 Viral myocarditis | ssc05416 Leishmaniasis | ssc05140 Staphylococcus aureus infection | ssc05150 Amoebiasis | ssc05146 Phagosome | ssc04145 Rheumatoid arthritis | ssc05323 Significant enriched pathway terms ( top 30 ) ‚àílog ( P value ) 0 2 4 6 8 Figure 3 : Top 30 significant enriched KEGG pathways . immune system process and immune response , including 166 DEGs ( Table S3 ) . Many DEGs involved in immune response were also identified in estrus compared with the diestrus of porcine follicle [ 17 ] . However , the functions of these genes need to be further studied in the estrous cycle . 5 . Conclusion This study provides comprehensive transcriptome data on the porcine ovaries at proestrus and estrus stages through RNA - Seq technology . There were a total of 2 , 167 DEGs , of which 1 , 383 downregulated genes and 784 upregulated genes were identified . This study provides useful information for understanding the molecular mechanisms of sow estrous cycle . However , these transcriptome data are preliminary , and the function of the DEGs requires further investigation in estrous cycle .
