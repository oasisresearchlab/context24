Here we ask whether similar biases are present in visual foraging in younger siblings of children with a diagnosis of ASD with or without additional high levels of hyperactivity and inattention . Fifty - four low - risk controls ( LR ) and 50 high - risk siblings ( HR ) took part in an eye - tracking study at 8 and 14 months and at 3 years of age . At 8 months , siblings of children with ASD and low levels of hyperactivity / inattention ( HR / ASD - HI ) were more likely to return to previously visited areas in the visual scene than were LR and siblings of children with ASD and high levels of hyperactivity / inattention ( HR / ASD + HI ) . Thus , we reveal a paradoxical effect , in which additional family risk for ADHD core - symptoms mitigates the effect of ASD risk on visual information foraging . Keywords : visual foraging , infants , ASD , hyperactivity / inattention , eye - tracking 3 Many human activities rely on information foraging , i . e . , the seeking out and processing of information . Theoretical accounts of information foraging draw heavily on general models for resource foraging , which describe a trade - off between effort or energy expenditure and the amount of resources the organism manages to secure . Optimal foraging requires shifting between exploitation , i . e . , taking advantage of the resource at hand , and exploration of the environment to discover new resources ( Cohen , McClure & Yu , 2007 ) . There is no absolute best combination of exploration and exploitation , but rather organisms gain from flexibly adapting foraging to environmental conditions ( i . e . , it is better to exploit the resources at hand if the further environment is uncertain , and better to explore when faced with competition ( Kacelnik , Houston & Krebs , 1981 ) . Any strong inherent bias , either towards exploratory behavior or for resource exploitation , might therefore interfere with optimal foraging . This paper deals with the development of such potential biases in foraging for information in infants at familial risk for ASD or for attentional problems . Atypical foraging in ASD and ADHD . Individual differences in foraging behavior have been related to particular neural systems . For example , biases for exploratory behavior were associated with differences in dopaminergic and noradrenergic function ( Frank et al , 2009 ; Jepma & Niewenhuis , 2011 ) . Similarly , stimulating dopaminergic function in monkeys led to an increase in preference for novel stimuli over old stimuli with larger reward value ( Costa et al . , 2014 ) . Explorative choices , i . e . , choosing a new over an old item , were shown to be preceded by increases in pupil diameter , which index locus coeruleus / noradrenergic function ( Jepma & Niewenhuis , 2011 ) . Both Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) and Attention 4 Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) have been associated with atypicality in dopamine ( e . g . , Solanto , 2002 ; Kriete & Noelle , 2015 ) and noradrenaline functions ( Biederman & Spencer , 1999 ; Blaser et al . , 2014 ) as well as , separately , with atypical information foraging . In ASD , decreased exploratory behavior was documented in a task in which children had to discover objects hidden in different containers . Children with ASD spent less time in active exploration and explored fewer containers with these behaviors related to anatomical differences in the cerebellum , such as differences in the size of the vermal lobules ( Pierce & Courchesne , 2001 ) . In another similar foraging study , Pellicano et al . ( 2011 ) reported less systematic searches and a higher proportion of revisitations in children with ASD . Differences were also found in free - viewing visual scanning ( Elison et al , 2012 ) . Typically developing ( TD ) and ASD participants aged 2 to 18 years were presented with large arrays of images . The number of images visited per unit of time increased with age in both groups , but with a steeper slope in TD participants ( Elison et al , 2012 ) . Thus , across measures , ASD seems to be associated with less exploratory behavior . When findings could not be explained by specific preferences related to the disorder , as is the case in both Pellicano et al . , ( 2011 ) and Pierce & Courchesne , ( 2001 ) , returning to already explored locations / objects could be driven by incomplete information processing or poor memory . However , IQ was not a predictor of performance in either Elisson et al . , ( 2012 ) or in Pierce & Courchesne , ( 2001 ) and groups were matched in IQ in Pellicano et al . , ( 2011 ) . Thus these biases seem to manifest independently of concurrent information processing difficulties . In contrast to ASD , ADHD is associated with extreme novelty seeking , especially in the case of the hyperactive and combined ( hyperactive and inattentive ) subtypes ( Salgado et al , 2008 ) . Intriguing evidence that genes associated with ADHD 5 ( e . g . , particular DRD4 gene variants ) are more frequent in populations that have a history of migration ( Chen et al , 1999 ; Mathews & Butler , 2011 ) , led to the suggestion that hyperactivity might be an adaptation to the food - scarce and volatile environment our ancestors lived in ( Jensen et al . , 1997 ) . Some rather indirect evidence for a bias towards exploratory behavior in ADHD comes from a study in which the number of regions visited when free - viewing a visual scene correlated with differences in curiosity ( Risko et al , 2012 ) , which some have associated with ADHD ( Williams & Taylor , 2006 ) . Thus , the existing literature suggests ASD and ADHD might be associated with opposing biases in foraging . However , since ASD and ADHD often co - occur ( approximately 20 % of UK 7 - year - olds with ASD meet criteria for ADHD , and vice versa , Russell et al . , 2014 ) , this raises the question of how ASD and ADHD - specific foraging biases interact during development . Additive phenotypic effects were previously described in children with co - morbid ASD and ADHD , for example neural processing of human gaze in these children was similar to both profiles of children with ASD only or with ADHD only ( Tye et al , 2013 ) . An increase in symptom severity , compared to the single diagnosis cases , was also documented ( e . g . , Goldin et al . , 2013 ; Craig et al . , 2015 ) . These findings raise the intriguing possibility that where disease - specific phenotypes are at opposite ends of a spectrum ( e . g . , increased exploration in ADHD and decreased exploration in ASD ) , risk for one disorder may mitigate the effects of risk for the other disorder . We were therefore interested in investigating the impact ASD and ADHD risk has on information foraging during development . Both occulo - motor behaviors and object manipulation have been used to measure information foraging in infants 6 ( Bornstein , Hahn & Suwalsky , 2013 ) . Of the two measures , visual scanning is less confounded by general motor development . Visual foraging and its development . It has been suggested that the type of cognitive processes that derived from spatial foraging for resources such as food , may also be associated with the control of visual attention ( Hills , Todd & Goldstone , 2008 ) . For example , when freely exploring new visual scenes , participants make shorter fixations and longer saccades during the first few seconds , covering the whole visual scene . However , as participants continue to look , their fixations gradually become longer and their saccades shorter ( Pannasch et al . , 2008 ; Fischer et al , 2013 ) This suggests that the optimum visual information strategy relies on an initial exploratory phase , where a new scene / environment is mapped to discover potential interesting sights . This is then followed by information exploitation , where chosen locations ( sources of information ) are repeatedly investigated ( Krebs , Kacelnik & Taylor , 1978 ) . Failure to explore the scene might lead to missing out on important information while prolonged exploration might prevent learning . There is still limited understanding of developmental changes in visual foraging , but the limited existing evidence suggests an increase in exploration with age . During the first month after birth , infants restrict their scanning to a small portion of an image , but by 3 months they produce longer saccades and gaze patterns that are more systematically distributed over visual scenes ( Bronson , 1991 ) . However , even beyond 6 months of age , scanning patterns remain restricted to particular locations of the visual scene and are therefore highly predictable ( Schesinger & Amso , 2013 ) . In the current study we will ask whether measures of visual scanning capture information foraging atypicalities early in development . 7 The current study . The current work is a re - analysis of a previously published dataset ( Elsabbagh et al . , 2013 ) . The “face - pop out” paradigm was designed to measure face orienting as an early marker for ASD . Infants freely explored displays containing a face and 4 other objects whilst their eye - movements were measured with an eye tracker ( Fig 1 ) . Because infants had 15 seconds to explore each new display , by analyzing the sequences of visits to faces and other objects / areas of interest ( AOIs ) , this paradigm can inform about visual foraging strategies . Study participants were infants with an older sibling with ASD , who were therefore themselves at - risk for ASD . Approximately 20 % of children at - risk will receive a diagnosis of ASD themselves ( Ozonoff et al , 2011 ) , and another 30 % will manifest elevated levels of ASD symptoms ( Messinger et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , by comparing visual foraging in this population to a low - risk cohort , we aim to capture differences due to genetic susceptibility for ASD . As mentioned earlier , ASD and ADHD are often co - occurring and , like ASD , ADHD has moderate heritability ( Larsson et al . , 2014 ) . To investigate the effect ADHD risk has on visual foraging , we characterized the older siblings’ hyperactivity and inattention profile using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ( SDQ ) . The SDQ has been extensively used as a screener for ADHD and has good sensitivity , especially for children with the combined subtype ( hyperactivity / inattention ) ( Ullebo et al . , 2011 ; Carballo et al . , 2014 ) . To reflect the fact that the SDQ is a screening , not a diagnostic , instrument we refer to the risk conferred by a high score on the SDQ as hyperactivity / inattention risk ( HI risk ) . We can thus compare the effect of ASD risk , and that of additional HI risk , on visual foraging during early development . Infants contributed data at three age points ( 8 months , 14 months and 3 years ) . We analyzed the temporal dynamics of 8 attention as participants scanned the different areas of interest ( AOIs ) , focusing in particular on the likelihood of images being revisited . We expected ASD risk to be associated with decreased exploration ( i . e . , higher likelihood of revisiting AOIs ) and that additional HI risk may moderate this effect . Methods Participants Fifty four infants at high familial risk ( HR ) and 50 infants at low familial risk ( LR ) for ASD took part in a longitudinal study . Infants attended lab - based testing 3 times , first between 6 and 10 months , a second time around 14 months and a third time around 3 years of age . Only a sub - set of participants contributed data at the 3 - year visit . At the time of enrolment , none of the infants had been diagnosed with any medical or developmental condition . HR infants all had an older sibling ( proband ) with a community clinical diagnosis of ASD . Proband diagnosis was confirmed by two expert clinicians ( xx , xx ) based on information from the Development and Wellbeing Assessment ( DAWBA ) and the parent - report Social Communication Questionnaire ( SCQ ) . Infants in the low - risk group were recruited from a volunteer database at the xxx . All low - risk infants had at least one older sibling with typical development and no first - degree relatives with ASD . None of the older siblings scored above instrument cut - off for ASD on the SCQ ( > 15 , 1 score missing ) . Assessing Hyperactivity / Inattention - risk Proband ADHD risk was attributed based on scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ( SDQ ) , filled in by the parent of HR participants . The SDQ is composed of 25 items that ask about behavioral attributes of the child and are 9 combined to form five subscales . The hyperactivity / inattention subscale covers restlessness , fidgeting , concentration , distractibility and impulsivity . Each item can be answered with : ‘Not true’ ‘Somewhat true’ or ‘Certainly true’ , and they are scored 0 , 1 or 2 respectively , giving a total score out of a possible 10 for each subscale . Screening studies suggest a cut - off of 8 / 10 as providing the best ADHD diagnostic accuracy ( Carballo et al . , 2014 ) . Using a cut - off of 8 , we separated the HR ASD group into a HR / ASD - HI group ( n = 26 ) , including children whose probands scored below 8 ( average = 5 . 19 ; SD = 1 . 7 ) and a HR / ASD + HI group ( n = 20 ) , when probands scored 8 or above ( average = 9 . 25 ; SD = 0 . 78 ) . Hyperactivity and Inattention subscale scores did not relate to proband social communication abilities ( Social Communication Questionnaire , Rutter & Bailey , 2003 ; r = . 246 , p > . 1 ) . Visual scanning task and procedure The same stimuli and procedure as previously described in Elsabbagh et al , ( 2013 ) was used . At 8 and 14 months , infants saw 14 different slides ( example in Figure 1 ) , each for 15 seconds . At 3 years , only 10 slides were shown . Each slide contained 5 images , one from each of the following categories : faces , mobile phones , birds , cars and scrambled faces . A central attention getter was presented before each slide / trial to re - orient infant’s attention . Infants were seated on their parent’s lap in front of the eye - tracking monitor ( at 8 and 14 months ) or on their own in front of the eye - tracking monitor ( 3 years of age ) . Parents were asked to refrain from pointing to the screen or naming any of the images . Revisitation analysis . Gaze data was recorded with a Tobii 1750 eye - tracker at 50 Hz . Data was parsed into fixations defined as ‘gaze remaining within a 30 pixel radius ( ∼ . 80° of visual angle ) for a minimum of 60 ms’ . A list of fixations , in the 10 order in which they occurred and their corresponding AOI , was extracted for each participant and used to compute visit durations and order during each trial . A visit was defined as the sum of all consecutive fixations made within an AOI . Each visit was coded as either a first visit ( the first visit to that AOI , coded as 0 ) or a revisit ( the AOI had been visited before within the trial , coded as 1 ) . The probability of choosing an old item was always zero at the first visit , since none of the other items had been fixated at this point within the trial . Likewise , the probability of choosing an old item at the second visit was always zero , because all of the possible target AOIs were new items ; the only old item was the AOI the eyes had just left . We coded up to 10 visits per trial . For each participant , we calculated the revisitation likelihood for each visit , from the 1 st to the 10 th , , by averaging across all trials . Younger sibling outcome characterization A standard measure of mental development level , the Mullen Scales for Early Learning ( MSEL ; Mullen , 1995 ) , was collected . The MSEL is a standardized direct developmental assessment that yields a standardized score ( mean = 100 , SD = 15 ) of overall intellectual ability ( Early Learning Composite standard score ) . The HR group was also assessed with the parent - report Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised ( ADI - R ; Lord et al . , 1994 ) and the Autism Diagnosis Observation Schedule ( ADOS , Lord et al , 2000 ) . A ‘best estimate clinical consensus’ approach to diagnosis was taken following a review by experienced clinical researchers ( xxx ) taking account of all information about the child ( i . e . MSEL , informal observation ) , in addition to information from the ADI - R and ADOS - G . Children were included in the ASD group if they met ICD - 10 ( World Health Organisation , 1993 ) criteria for any pervasive developmental disorder ( PDD ) . Given the young age of the children , and in line with 11 the changes to DSM - 5 ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013 ) , no attempt was made to assign specific sub - categories of PDD / childhood autism diagnosis . Children from the HR group were considered typically developing ( high - risk Typical ) if they ( i ) did not meet ICD - 10 criteria for an ASD ; ( ii ) did not score above the ASD cut - off on the ADOS or ADI ; ( iii ) scored within 1 . 5 SD of the population mean on the Mullen Early Learning Composite ( ELC ) score ( > 77 . 5 ) and Receptive Language ( RL ) and Expressive Language ( EL ) subscale T scores ( > 35 ) . Children from the HR group were considered to have atypical development if they did not fall into any of the above groups . That is , they either scored above the ADOS or ADI cut - off for ASD or scored < 1 . 5SD on the Mullen ELC or RL and EL , but did not meet ICD - 10 criteria for an ASD . From the 47 At - risk participants taking part in this task , 17 met criteria for an ASD diagnosis , 18 were At - risk Typical and 12 were in the HR Atypical group ( 9 scoring above the ADOS ASD cut - off , 1 scoring above the ADOS ASD cut - off and < 1 . SD Mullen ELC cut - off , 1 scoring above the ADI ASD cut - off and 1 scoring < 1 . 5SD Mullen ELC cut - off ) . Results Preliminary analyses . We computed the average number of AOI visits per trial for each age group . On average , participants contributed 7 visits ( min average 3 , max average 9 . 9 ) at 8 months , 8 visits at 14 months ( min 2 . 42 , max 10 ) and 9 visits at 3 years ( min 6 . 8 and max 10 ) . Thus , to avoid data loss , we restricted the analysis to the first three visits , which meant restricting the analysis of revisitation likelihood to visit 3 ( since the likelihood of revisitation is zero at the first and second visit ) . Given that at the 3 rd visit all previous visits had been on new AOIs , this measure will be unaffected by visit history ( and by potential group differences in visit history ) . 12 Because at both 8 months and 3 years , the HR / ASD - HI group had the lowest scores on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning of the 3 groups , ( Table 1 ) , we investigated the relationships between revisitation likelihood and concurrent Mullen scores . None of these relationships reached significance ( see SOM ) . Does ASD and HI risk influence visual foraging ? We carried out a repeated measures ANOVA on likelihood of revisitation at the 3 rd visit , with age ( 8 , 14 months and 3 - years ) and group ( 24 LR , 20 HR / ASD - HI , 12 HR / ASD + HI ) as within participant measures . This yielded a main effect of age ( F ( 2 , 106 ) = 17 . 97 , p < . 001 ) , as well as a significant effect of group ( F ( 2 , 53 ) = 3 . 81 , p = . 028 ) . With age , all groups became more exploratory , in the sense that they were increasingly more likely to visit a new AOI rather than returning to a previously seen one . Bonferroni - corrected post - hoc t - tests revealed that LR participants were less likely to re - visit than the HR / ASD - HI group ( p = . 051 ) , whilst the HR / ASD + HI group was not significantly different from either the HR / ASD - HI participants ( p = . 091 ) or the LR participants . We followed - up on a significant age x group interaction ( F ( 4 , 106 ) = 3 . 40 , p = . 012 ) with 3 repeated measures ANOVAs for each age ( Figure 2 ) . At 8 months the effect of group was significant ( F ( 2 , 95 ) = 7 . 39 , p = . 001 ; HR / ASD - HI were significantly different from both LR ( p = . 009 ) and HR / ASD + HI ( p = . 001 ) , the last two being indistinguishable statistically ) . Likelihood of re - visitation was above chance level ( . 25 ) in all groups ( LR : t ( 47 ) = 7 . 07 , p < . 001 ; HR / ASD - HI : t ( 25 ) = 10 . 54 , p < . 001 ; HR / ASD + HI : t ( 17 ) = 3 . 17 , p = . 006 ) At 14 months , the effect of group was again significant , F ( 2 , 86 ) = 4 . 65 , p = . 012 ; only LR and HR / ASD - HI were significantly different from each other ( p = . 012 ) . Likelihood of re - visitation was above chance level in all groups ( LR : t ( 43 ) = 13 3 . 17 , p = . 003 ; HR / ASD - HI : t ( 23 ) = 4 . 53 , p < . 001 ; HR / ASD + HI : t ( 17 ) = 5 . 41 , p < . 001 ) . Groups did not significantly differ at 3 years and at all ages likelihood of re - visitation was at chance ( LR : t ( 25 ) < 1 ; HR / ASD - HI : t ( 19 ) < 1 ; HR / ASD + HI : t ( 13 ) < 1 ) . Thus , by 3 years of age , when encountering a new visual scene exploratory biases are apparent ( i . e . , the likelihood of return falling below chance level ) . Given that a dimensional measure of HI risk was available ( the SDQ scores vary between 0 and 10 ) , and to strengthen our findings , we investigated the quantitative relationship between revisitation likelihood at 8 and 14 months and this measure . This analysis yielded a significant negative correlation between revisitation likelihood and SDQ scores at 8 months ( r = - . 430 , p = . 003 ; Figure 2 ) , but not at 14 months . Were group differences driven by returns to the face ? Since many revisits at the 3rd visit are returns to the face ( about 50 % of first looks are to the face , Elsabbagh et al . , 2013 ) , it is important to know whether the group differences described mainly reflect differences in returns to this stimulus . To ask this question we ran a repeated measures ANOVA with type ( Face , non - Face ) and group ( LR , HR / ASD - HI , HR / ASD + HI ) , at each age point . At both 8 and 14 months this analysis yielded significant main effects of type ( 8 months : F ( 1 , 88 ) = 42 . 35 , p < . 001 ; 14 months : F ( 1 , 83 ) = 23 . 14 , p < . 001 ) and group ( 8 months : F ( 2 , 88 ) = 3 . 64 , p = . 030 ; 14 months : F ( 2 , 83 ) = 3 . 47 , p = . 036 ) , but a non - significant interaction of type x group ( 8 months : F ( 2 , 88 ) = 2 . 06 , p > . 1 ; 14 months : F ( 2 , 83 ) < 1 ) , which suggests that group differences in revisitation likelihood concern both types of images . At 3 years , the effects of type and group were not significant ( type : F ( 1 , 55 ) = 2 . 84 , p > . 05 ; group : F ( 2 , 55 ) < 1 ) , but there was a marginally significant interaction between type and group ( F ( 2 , 55 ) = 2 . 99 , p = . 058 ) . However , follow - up paired t tests yielded no significant effects of type . 14 Is foraging related to the child’s ASD diagnosis ? Since ASD diagnosis was available for the younger sibling , we also ran a repeated - measures ANOVA on the revisit likelihood , with age as a within participant variable and outcome ( LR , HR - TD , HR - Atypical and HR - ASD ) as between - participants factor . This yielded a significant interaction between age and outcome ( F ( 6 , 108 ) = 2 . 43 , p = . 030 ) and a non - significant effect of outcome ( F ( 3 , 54 ) < 1 ) . We followed up this analysis with 3 univariate ANOVAs for each age point . Although HR - ASD did have the highest likelihood of revisitation at 8 months , outcome was not a significant predictor ( F ( 3 , 102 ) = 2 . 23 , p = . 089 ( see Figure S1 ) . Follow up paired t - tests against the LR group ( Dunnett t , Dunnett 1955 ) , yielded marginally significant effects ( LR vs . HR - ASD , p = . 084 ) . At 14 months there was a significant effect of outcome ( F ( 3 , 92 ) = 2 . 78 , p = . 045 ) , but none of the follow - up paired t - tests were significant . The effect of outcome was not significant at 3 years . To explore whether proband HI affected all outcome groups , at 8 months a second repeated measures ANOVA was run on the high - risk group only , this time with both outcome ( HR - TD , HR - Atypical and HR - ASD ) and HI level ( low , high ) as between participants variables . This yielded a significant effect of HI level ( F ( 1 , 43 ) = 10 . 51 , p = . 002 ) , which did not interact with outcome ( F ( 2 , 43 ) < 1 ; see figure S2 ) . Thus , high proband HI increased exploration in those siblings that developed ASD as well as in the typically developing children . Discussion Borrowing the foraging framework developed for appetitive decision - making 15 in animals ( Cohen , McClure & Yu , 2007 ; Kacelnik , Huston & Krebs , 1981 ) , we investigated the development of exploratory biases in visual information foraging . We observed age related changes . Six months olds showed a strong tendency to revisit previously seen AOIs , with 40 % of their 3 rd visits being revisits . In contrast , by 3 years of age , when faced with a new visual scene , children randomly choose whether to explore a new AOI or revisit . Thus , although we observe a decrease with age in exploitative choices ( i . e . , preferring to return to old AOIs ) , not even at 3 years of age does foraging become driven by exploration ( i . e . , consistently preferring to sample new AOIs ) . The main question that motivated this research was whether background family risk for ASD and hyperactivity and inattention ( core symptoms of ADHD ) , impact on visual foraging early in life . In terms of the likelihoods of revisitation , the HR / ASD - HI group was more likely to return to old locations than were LR participants , at both 8 and 14 months . When the sibling’s own ASD diagnosis was taken into account , a trend was found for higher revisitation likelihood in 8 - month - old HR - ASD , compared to LR controls . This is reminiscent of previous findings in populations with a diagnosis of ASD that also show high return rates when exploring visual scenes or real environments ( Pierce & Courchesne , 2001 ; Pallicano et al . , 2011 , Elison et al . , 2012 ) . We also predicted that proband hyperactivity / inattention would be associated with a bias towards exploration . Indeed , at 8 months likelihood to re - visit AOIs inversely relates to proband SDQ hyperactivity and inattention scores . However , when groups are compared , HR / ASD + HI participant performance was similar to that of the control group at 8 months and was not different from either the HR / ASD - HI or LR at 14 months . Our findings are compatible with an additive effect , where ASD and ADHD risk contribute opposing biases . Additive effects of dual ASD and ADHD 16 diagnosis have been previously documented ( e . g . , Tye et al , 2013 ) . More often then not , the literature reports increased symptom severity in children with a dual diagnosis of ASD and ADHD ( e . g , Goldin et al . , 2013 ; Yerys et al . , 2009 ) . This is the first evidence for a potential moderating effect of one risk type on another . However , because we are assessing the effects of co - occurring ASD and HI risk and not those of co - occurrence of these symptoms in a particular individual , we are unable to say at this point whether HI risk acts to reduce the effects of ASD risk in the same children or whether the “typical” performance of the HR / ASD + HI group results from some children having inherited the ASD risk factors and other HI risk factors . Some indication that the former hypothesis might be true comes from the fact that HR / ASD + HI performance variance is comparable to those of the other two groups ( Levene’s F ( 2 , 89 ) = 1 . 17 , p > . 1 ; Figure S1 ) . It is important to highlight the fact that whether co - occurring conditions result in additive , multiplicative or a completely new phenotype may vary from one phenotypic trait to another and therefore the current findings should not be generalized . Why are the effects of proband hyperactivity / inattention more prominent earlier in development ? Transitory signatures of risk have been reported previously . For example , 9 month old visual search performance is a predictor of later ASD symptoms , but the performance of 15 month olds does not relate to later outcome ( Gliga et al . 2015 ) . Similarly , the amount of looking towards faces is a predictor of later face recognition when measured at 8 months , but not at 14 months ( deKlerk et al , 2014 ) . It is possible that these developmental changes reflect adaptive mechanisms following initial perturbations in brain functioning , mechanisms that eventually mask the perturbations , but not before development has been set on an atypical pathway ( Johnson , Jones & Gliga , 2015 ) . It also remains possible that our findings do not 17 reflect heritable genetic background but environmental effects . Growing up alongside a sibling with a developmental disorder may in itself affect development . Proband hyperactivity symptoms may be more perturbing when the sibling is younger , thus explaining the stronger relationship found at 8 months of age . Despite the uncertainty regarding the mechanisms behind the effects we document here , these findings remain novel and important as they add to our understanding of both early learning and psychopathology . How infants explore visual information could have long - term consequences on their learning abilities ( see SOM ) . We also reveal putative mechanisms for resilience , where high levels of hyperactivity / inattention in older siblings , through shared genetic or environmental mechanisms , can have paradoxical effects , being associated with optimal information foraging in infancy . 18 American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) .

Scatter plot of re - visit likelihood at 8 months Figure S2 . Re - visit likelihood at 8 months , depending on ASD Outcome ( left ) and the same data split by outcome and HI risk ( right ) Supplemental Analysis : The relationship with concurrent and later learning abilities . Since higher proband hyperactivity and inattention ( HI ) is associated with foraging values that are closer to the chance level ( even for high levels of HI , foraging does not become exploratory ) , this may reflect poor memory for previous visit locations rather than more optimal 28 information foraging ( in both the Low risk and the HR / ASD + HI groups ) . This is where investigating the impact foraging measures have on learning , becomes important . To ask whether early foraging and learning relate to each other during development , revisit likelihood at 8 and 14 months was entered in a cross - lagged autoregressive model with the Early Learning Composite ( ELC ) standard score at all ages ( Figure S3 ) . Because of the high data loss in the foraging measure at 3 years , we have not included this measure in the analysis . Autoregressive models test how the variance - covariance matrix changes over time and are thus ideal for dressing developmental hypothesis . The model fit well the data ( χ 2 = 9 . 20 ; p = . 16 ; CFI = . 93 ) . Eight - months foraging measure significantly predicted 3 - years ELC ( STDYX standardized estimates : ß = - . 198 ; S . E . = . 07 ; p = . 008 ) , with higher likelihood of return predicting lower ELS scores . Concurrent relationships between foraging and ELC were not significant . After taking into account longitudinal relationships in foraging at different ages and also in learning abilities at different ages , as well as bi - directional relationships between foraging and learning at later time points , foraging at 8 months significantly predicted learning at 3 years of age , with decreased exploratory predicting poor learning . This direction of the relationship is very much in line with previous studies investigating object exploration ( Bornstein , Hahn , & Suwalsky , 2013 ) . However , since both highly explorative foraging ( i . e . always driven to novel information and never to consolidation ) and highly exploitative foraging ( i . e . only extracting information from a restricted number of sources ) , restrict learning , a U - shaped relationship is expected to relate foraging to learning . It is probably because we investigated information foraging in a population at high - risk for ASD that we only observe one side of the U - shaped relationship . Future studies assessing populations at risk for only ADHD or populations with an ADHD diagnosis , might capture the other end of this relationship , where extreme exploration , i . e . rarely returning to re - inspect and consolidate information , may also be related to poor learning .
