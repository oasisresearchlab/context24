At the plasma membrane , the GTPase seen at the necks of clathrin - coated pits in the shibire activity of dynamin is required for synaptic vesicle re - flies , leading to the speculation that dynamin assists in cycling ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ) , receptor - mediated pinching the clathrin - coated pit from the plasma mem - endocytosis ( see below ) , and caveolae internalization brane . However , the hypothesis that dynamin acts as a ( Henley et al . , 1998 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ) .

The dephosphoryla - tion of dynamin - 1 by calcineurin temporally correlates with the depolarization of nerve termini and inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin - 1 ( Liu et al . , 1994b ) . The role of phosphorylation in the regulation of dynamin function remainsunclear andmaybe specific tothe nervetermini , since dynamin - 2 appears not to be a substrate for pro - tein kinase C ( Sontag et al . , 1994 ) . Until now , measuring dynamin function in vitro has been limited to assessing its GTPase activity . We report here a novel assay to investigate the role of dynamin in vesicle budding . Our data demonstrate that purified recombinant dynamin canbind to anionic phospholipids in the absence of other proteins or guanine nucleotides to form helical tubular structures . Treatment of these tubes with GTP causes a rapid alteration in structure , resulting in the constriction of dynamin tubes and the formation of numerous small vesicles . We believe that this represents a critical step in the process that occurs when clathrin - coated pits bud from the plasma mem - brane . Results Figure 1 .

Visualizing tubes in ice also gives us tion . This processappears cooperative , considering that some insightinto the mechanism of tube formation ( Fig - ures 7A – 7C ) . It appears that dynamin assembly is coop - Table 1 . Dynamin - Lipid Tubes Constrict upon GTP Treatment erative ; once initiated , tubes elongate readily . In the absence of lipid , dynamin can assemble into Control 1 mM GTP helical spirals either in low salt ( Hinshaw and Schmid , Average tube diameter ( nm ) 52 (cid:54) 4 ( N (cid:53) 53 ) 43 (cid:54) 2 ( N (cid:53) 63 ) 1995 ) or in the presence of transition - state analogs of Dynamin Promotes Membrane Vesiculation 1025 GTP ( Carr and Hinshaw , 1997 ) . However , dynamin - lipid tubes form under conditions that do not favor spiral formation ( 100 mM salt and no GTP analogs ) . Treatment of preformed tubes with Triton X - 100 results in struc - tures that appear similar to dynamin spirals formed in the absence of lipid ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that certain lipids may provide a surface on which dynamin – dynamin interactions occur readily , there - by shifting the equilibrium toward dynamin assembly . The self - association of membrane - bound dynamin may be responsible for the formation and stabilization of the neck of the coated pit in vivo , analogous to the way the clathrin lattice stabilizes curvature of the plasma membrane . However , unlike clathrin ( Robinson , 1992 ) , dynamin does not appear to require adaptor proteins for assembly on a membrane . Phosphorylated dynamin retained the ability to form dynamin - lipid tubes in vitro . We propose that the PRD andthe phosphorylationstate of dynaminmay be critical for recruitment of dynamin to the coated pits but are notinvolved inlipid association or helicalassemblyonce dynamin is appropriately targeted . Since the carboxyl - terminal cleavage site was readily available to protease and membrane - associated dynamin could be phos - phorylated by PKC , the PRD is likely to be accessible to SH3 domain – containing proteins and protein kinases when dynamin is bound to the plasma membrane . An - other domain of dynamin that is a likely candidate for lipid binding is the pleckstrin homology domain ( Zheng et al . , 1996 ) . In support of this , we found that the 40 kDa subtilisin - cleaved fragment , whichwas derived from the amino - terminal GTPase domain and therefore lacked Figure 5 .

Other stricted ( they were of smaller diameter than control tubes ) . It is tempting to speculate that the constricted GTPases appear to workas molecular switches with the GTP - bound state being “on” and the GDP - bound state tubes we see are related to the functionally defined constricted necks of clathrin - coated pits , which are de - being “off . ” Our current work suggests that dynamin may not behave in this manner .

We therefore concludethat dynamindoes not behaveas a molecular switch but as a force - generating molecule . Preliminary results indicatethat recombinantdynamin - 2 ( Warnock et al . , 1997 ) , which shares a 79 % amino acid identity with dynamin - 1 ( Cook et al . , 1994 ; Warnock et al . , 1997 ) , can also form tubes that undergo a similar conformational change upon treatment with GTP ( data not shown ) . This suggests that the process may be a general property of the dynamin family ( for review , see Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . This GTP - induced vesiculation has further significance with the recent discovery that dy - namin - 2 also plays a role at the Golgi apparatus ( Jones et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamin can cause vesiculation in vitro at nucleotide concentrations similar to intracellular GTP levels , indi - cating that dynamin would be fully capable of vesicula - tion under normal physiological conditions . Therefore , there may be an inhibitor of dynamin action that would regulate vesicle formation . Alternatively , dynamin may be unregulated , with the limiting step being the closure of the collar around the neck of the clathrin - coated pit . As soon as the collar is in place , vesiculation would occur . The inability of many investigators to visualize dynamin collars aroundthe necks ofclathrin - coated pits may then be explained by this rapid vesiculation event . How does dynamin mediate vesiculation ? In agree - ment with other groups , we propose that dynamin is recruited to the clathrin - coated pit via interactions with its proline - richdomain ( Shpetneret al . , 1996 ; Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ) . Once dynamin is appropriately targeted , it binds directly to the lipid bilayer , where dynamin – dynamin interactions drive theconstriction of the bilayer into a tube , introducing strain into the membrane . GTP hydrolysis causes a further constriction of the dynamin helixaround thetube , whichmay besufficientfor vesicu - lation . Alternatively , disruption of dynamin – dynamin in - teractions , which would result in a dramatic release of Figure 6 .
