ARTICLES Membrane scission by the ESCRT - III complex Thomas Wollert 1 * , Christian Wunder 2 * , Jennifer Lippincott - Schwartz 2 & James H . Hurley 1 The endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) system is essential for multivesicular body biogenesis , in which cargo sorting is coupled to the invagination and scission of intralumenal vesicles . The ESCRTs are also needed for budding of enveloped viruses including human immunodeficiency virus 1 , and for membrane abscission in cytokinesis . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , ESCRT - III consists of Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps24 and Vps2 ( also known as Did4 ) , which assemble in that order and require the ATPase Vps4 for their disassembly . In this study , the ESCRT - III - dependent budding and scission of intralumenal vesicles into giant unilamellar vesicles was reconstituted and visualized by fluorescence microscopy . Here we show that three subunits of ESCRT - III , Vps20 , Snf7 and Vps24 , are sufficient to detach intralumenal vesicles . Vps2 , the ESCRT - III subunit responsible for recruiting Vps4 , and the ATPase activity of Vps4 were required for ESCRT - III recycling and supported additional rounds of budding . The minimum set of ESCRT - III and Vps4 proteins capable of multiple cycles of vesicle detachment corresponds to the ancient set of ESCRT proteins conserved from archaea to animals . The ESCRT machinery is essential for several fundamental cellular pathways 1 – 7 . The biogenesis of lysosomes involves the maturation of early endosomes into multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) 1 , 2 , 5 . In this path - way , portions of the limiting membrane of the endosome invaginate and then detach into the lumen of the endosome , forming intralu - menal vesicles ( ILVs ) . The MVBs then fuse with the lysosome and the ILVs and their contents are degraded . Cell - surface receptors destined for downregulation and some lysosomal - resident enzymes are sorted into this pathway following their covalent ubiquitination . The ESCRTs are involved both in sorting of ubiquitinated cargo into ILVs and in the morphogenesis of the ILVs themselves 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 . The ESCRT complexes are also required for the release of nascent human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV - 1 ) virions from the plasma mem - brane of human cells 8 – 10 . The ESCRTs are needed for cytokinesis in both animal cells 11 , 12 and a subset of archaea 13 , 14 . The detachment of ILVs from the endosomal limiting membrane involves the scission of the narrow membrane neck connecting the nascent vesicle with the limiting membrane ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . This process is topologically opposite to the mechanism of membrane cleavage by dynamin family proteins 15 , which coat the outer surface of membrane tubules and cleave from the outside . Cleavage of the mem - brane neck connecting a nascent virion to the plasma membrane or connectingtwodaughtercellsincytokinesisalsooccursfromthemem - brane surface contiguous with the inside of the neck ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The conserved and ubiquitous involvement of ESCRTs in the inwardly directed cleavage of membrane necks has led to the view that ESCRTs are likely to have membrane scission activity . So far the absenceofanESCRTscissionassayreconstitutedentirelyfrompurifiedproteinsandlipidshaspreventedadirecttestofthishypothesis , andhas more broadly impeded progress in the ESCRT field . TheESCRTfamilyconsistsoftheESCRT - 0 , - I , - IIand - IIIcomplexes together with Vps4 , Alix ( Bro1 in yeast ) and other associated pro - teins 4 , 6 , 7 . ESCRT - 0 , - I and - II are soluble , contain ubiquitin - binding domains , and are primarilyinvolved in cargosorting and in the recruit - ment and activation of ESCRT - III . The ESCRT - III subunits Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps24andVps2aresolublemonomersincytosol 16 , andthecrystal structure of one of these subunits is known 17 . Activated ESCRT - III subunits assemble into a detergent - insoluble complex on the endoso - mal membrane 16 , 18 , 19 . Overexpression of two of the human orthologues of Snf7 ( CHMP4A and CHMP4B ) leads to plasma membrane evagina - tions that are coated on the inside and have dimensions comparable to those of membrane necks cleaved by the ESCRTs 20 . ESCRT - III disassembly requires hydrolysis of ATP by the AAA ATPase Vps4 ( ref . 21 ) . The amino - terminal MIT domain of Vps4 binds to a subset of ESCRT - III proteins by means of MIM1 ( refs 22 , 23 ) and MIM2 ( ref . 24 ) motifs in their carboxy termini . ESCRT - III subunits can form fila - ments 25 and helical tubes in vitro 26 that can be disassembled by Vps4 . These observations indicate that the ESCRT - III 2 Vps4 module is a good candidate for a membrane scission machine . Recently , fluor - escence microscopy of bilayer giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) has become established asa tool for thereconstitution ofreactions in mem - brane trafficking 27 – 30 . We set out to initiate an in vitro assay for the ESCRT machinery and to determine whether the ESCRTs have an intrinsic membrane scission capability using purified ESCRT - III sub - units and Vps4 in a GUV - based assay . ESCRT - III and Vps4 recruitment in vitro Purified ESCRT - III proteins aggregate when overexpressed in bacteria or when purified and concentrated ; this has posed an obstacle to bio - chemicalanalysis . Toavoidoff - pathwayeffectsduetoaggregation , care was taken to preserve all ESCRT - III subunits in their monomeric state . ESCRT - III subunits were expressed as cleavable maltose - binding pro - tein ( MBP ) fusions 26 , and maintained at low micromolar concentra - tions following cleavage . The absence of aggregation was verified for each ESCRT - III protein by size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . In the yeast MVB pathway , Vps20 is recruited and activated by ESCRT - II ( refs 16 , 31 ) . Vps20 and other ESCRT - III proteins are maintained in an inactive , soluble state by autoinhibition by their C termini 18 , 19 .

To simplify the reconstitution of the system by bypassing the need for ESCRT - II while avoiding spontaneous aggregation , we used the partial C - terminal deletion construct Vps20 D C . This construct was mono - meric , as judged by SEC and light scattering ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . GUVs with an endosome - like membrane composition 32 , 33 were generated by electroformation 34 from 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( POPC ) : 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - l - serine ( POPS ) : phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 ) P ) : cholesterol at a molar ratio of 62 : 10 : 3 : 25 . We verified that fluorescently labelled Vps20 and Vps20 D C bound to these GUVs ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Vps20 did not bind efficiently when the acidic lipid POPS was omitted from the mixture ( Fig . 1c ) , consistent with the expecta - tion that Vps20 binds to negatively charged membranes through a large electropositive surface 17 . Yeast ESCRT - III assembles in the following order : Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps24 , Vps2 ( ref . 35 ) . Vps2 is the only one of these subunits to contain the Vps4 - binding MIM1 motif 22 , 23 . The Vps20 D C construct used in this study lacked the Vps4 - binding MIM2 motif 24 . Vps4 is not recruited to membranes in the absence of ESCRT - III . Unlabelled ESCRT - IIIs were added sequentially and the recruitmentoflabelledVps4wasmonitored . Vps4wasrecruitedtothe limiting membrane and internal structures in GUVs when all four ESCRT - III subunits were added beforehand ( Fig . 1d ) . Vps4 was recruited neither to the limiting membrane nor to internal structures if Vps24 and Vps2 were omitted ( Fig . 1e ) .

Therefore , all results were compared to controls that had undergone identical manipulations and incuba - tions using buffer blanks ( Fig . 1f ) . When the reaction was initiated with Vps20 D C , a massive increase in the number of ILVs was observed over baseline ( Fig . 1g , h ) . Full - length Vps20 was less active , consistent with its autoinhibition ( Fig . 1h ) . Vps20 D C was used for all subsequent experiments owing to its greater activity . Labelled Vps4 was internalized into ILVs when all ESCRT - III subunits were present ( Fig . 1d ) . Much or all of this poolof Vps4 , and theunlabelled ESCRT - III associated with it , may be a passenger on the ILVs . In the absence of cargo , viral Gag or other material on the membrane , it would not be surprising for a portion of the ESCRT - III and Vps4 to associate non - productively with naked lipids . These data show that ESCRT - III proteins are able to markedly perturb membrane structure . ESCRT - III carries out membrane scission The diffusion of soluble green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) was used to assess permeability between bulk solution and putative ILVs . In each experiment , all of the ESCRT - III subunits and Vps4 were added , whereas the order of addition of GFP was varied ( Fig . 2 ) . When GFP was added with Vps20 D C , Snf7 or Vps24 , all of the ILVs imaged were green ( Fig . 2a 2 c ) . Therefore , until Vps24 was added , all of the internal structures were still connected to the exterior through the bulk phase . When GFP was added with Vps2 ( Fig . 2d ) , no green structures were observed . Thus , at this stage , all of the ILVs were detached from the limiting membrane . No further change in the nature of the ILVs was seen when Vps4 was added in the absence of ATP ( Fig . 2e ) . ILV detachment was corroborated by a three - dimensional recon - struction of a GUV in which GFP had been added at the Snf7 stage ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . The ILVs in this GUV were green ( Fig . 3b ) , indicating that they were formed in the course of the experiment . Another reconstruction was performed for a GUV treated with only Vps20 , Snf7 and Vps24 ( data not shown ) , showing complete detachment of ILVs . The ILVs within a GUV were highly mobile ( Supplementary Movie 2 ) , consistent with their complete detachment . The bulk phase uptake experiment was repeated while omitting the subunits one at a time . GFP was added after Vps24 in these experi - ments . Omission of Vps20 D C led to a sharp decrease in ILV forma - tion ( Fig . 4a ) , whereas omission of Snf7 almost completely abrogated ILV formation ( Fig . 4b ) . Omission of Vps24 , with GFP added in its place , led to modestly decreased ILV formation ( Fig . 4c ) . A combina - tion of detached and non - detached vesicles was observed in the absence of Vps24 ( Fig . 4c ) . When Vps2 or Vps4 was omitted ( Fig . 4d , e ) , the GUVs were indistinguishable from the situation with a b Figure 3 | Three - dimensional reconstruction of an ESCRT - III - treated GUV . a , Three - dimensional reconstruction of a GUV that was incubated with Vps20 D C , Snf7 , Vps24 , Vps2 and Vps4 , with GFP added together with Snf7 . b , A Z - stack of the same GUV shows that the ILVs are filled with GFP , indicating that they were detached subsequent to the addition of Snf7 .

We found that efficient ILV formation and detachment require Vps20 D C , Snf7 and Vps24 ( Fig . 4f ) . When PtdIns ( 3 ) P was replaced by another endosomal phosphoinositide , phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) , the reaction proceeded just as with PtdIns ( 3 ) P ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , c ) . When phosphoinositides were omitted but the mole fraction of the mono - anionic lipid POPS was increased to maintain the same net negative charge , ILV formation was reduced by about half ( Supplementary Fig . 3b , c ) . Thus , phosphoinositides promote the reaction but are not strictly required . Vps4 recycles ESCRT - III after scission The bulk phase uptake experiment was modified such that ATP and GFP were added after Vps4 ( Fig . 5a ) . The resulting images showed that the GUVs contained a mixture of GFP - filled and empty vesicles . When ATP and GFP were added , but Vps4 omitted , no GFP - filled vesicles were observed ( Fig . 5b ) , as seen in the presence of Vps4 and absence of ATP ( Fig . 2e ) . Thus , the addition of ATP to the ESCRT - III 2 Vps4 mixture after the termination of one round of ILV formation leads to a second wave of ILV formation . Omission of Vps2 completely inhibited the second wave of ILV formation ( Fig . 5c , d ) , even though Vps2isnotessentialfortheinitialroundofformation . Thisisconsistent withexpectation , becauseVps2istheonlyESCRT - IIIcomponentinthe model system that contains a Vps4 - binding MIM motif 22 , 23 . Specific ESCRT - III 2 Vps4interactionsarerequiredfor recycling , recapitulating thebiologicalfunctionofVps4 ( ref . 16 ) . Vps4isfunctionallycompetent in the in vitro system , and the lack of a Vps4 effect on ILV detachment was not due to a lack of Vps4 activity . These observations show that the ATP hydrolysis step is not directly involved in vesicle detachment , but that it is indirectly involved by virtue of recycling ESCRT - III for mul - tiple rounds of vesicle detachment . Discussion We have reconstituted ESCRT - dependent membrane scission using a minimal set of protein components and a simple model for the eukaryotic endosomal membrane . The proteins included correspond to the minimal set conserved between eukaryotes and archaea , ESCRT - III and Vps4 ( refs 13 , 14 ) . The model system recapitulates the ordered recruitment of ESCRT - III and Vps4 established in yeast . Snf7 has the highest stoichiometry in vivo relative to other subunits 35 , and is the most important subunit in cargo sequestration 35 . The in vitro studies show that Snf7 is the most potent of the subunits in membrane scission . The behaviour of the system is consistent with known biological and biochemical data . The first major insight is that ESCRT - III proteins alone have the intrinsic ability to drive the detachment of ILVs . ESCRT - III is capable of cleaving membrane necks with the appropriate inward topology in this minimal system . It is remarkable that the system does not require any of the upstream ESCRT complexes ( - 0 , - I or - II ) , cargo , unusual lipids such as lysobisphosphatidic acid 27 or manipulation of membrane tension . Most of these factors are still likely to modulate the reaction , even if theyarenotessential . For example , theILVsseeninthisstudyare more heterogeneousandfar largerthan thoseseen physiologically 36 . We previously suggested that ESCRT - I and perhaps other upstream ESCRTs might regulate ILV size 37 . In a cellular setting the bud neck is scaffolded by upstream ESCRTs and cargo ( MVB pathway ) , viral Gag assembly ( HIV - 1 budding ) or the extension of the central spindle coupled to membrane addition ( cytokinesis ) . In the in vitro assay the ESCRT - IIIproteinsscaffoldtheformationoftheirownmembraneneck . In vitro scission may be acting at both the intravesicular and extravesi - cular end of the neck , but the recycling step requires action from the extravesicularside . SubstantialamountsoflabelledESCRT - IIIandVps4 are on ILVs , indicating that some of the cleavage is occurring intrave - sicularly . However , theabilityofVps4torecycleaportionoftheESCRT - III demonstrates that at least some in vitro scission is driven from the extravesicular end . Under physiological conditions , the presence of cargo , Gag , and so on , is likely to inhibit scission from the intravesicular sideoftheneck . Theefficiencyoftheneckclosureandthepredominance of extravesicular cleavage would be higher in the physiological setting of apreformedneck . NoneofthisaltersthemajorconclusionthatESCRT - III alone can detach ILVs from the limiting membrane . The second major insight pertains to the role of ATP hydrolysis by Vps4 , the only thermodynamic driving force for the reaction . It has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis by Vps4 , while anchored tightly to the membrane by ESCRT - III , could power a dynamin - like con - striction of the neck leading to cleavage 26 . Although Vps4 can dis - assemble ESCRT - III in vitro 25 , 26 , the relationship between disassembly and vesicle scission was unknown . Here we find that Vps4 acts after the membrane scission step to recycle ESCRT - III proteins . This has a precedent in SNARE - dependent vesicle fusion . SNAREs drive vesicle fusion by forming tight complexes that bring opposing membranes into proximity 38 . SNARE complexes do not dissociate spontaneously , but require the hydrolysis of ATP by the ATPase NSF ( N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor ) after membrane fusion 38 . A recycling role for Vps4 is consistent with all available data , and fits well with the SNARE 2 NSF precedent . Snf7 is the most crucial of the ESCRT - III subunits for membrane scission . Snf7 can form either spirals or extended tubes when over - expressed 20 .

A thinfilmoflipid mixturescontain - ing POPC ( 62mol % ) , POPS ( 10mol % ) , cholesterol ( 25mol % ) , PtdIns ( 3 ) P ( 3mol % ) and 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( lissamine rhodamine B sulphonyl ) ( rhodamine - PE ) ( 0 . 1mol % ) was applied to indium - tin - oxide - covered glass slides and placed into a custom - made Teflon chamber . The glass slideswere separated bya 2mm thin glucose solution ( 600mM ) , and an electric AC - field ( 1V , 10Hz ) was applied for 4h at 60 u C following the previously describedGUVelectro - formationprotocol 34 . The GUVswerecollectedaftercool - ing to room temperature ( 25 u C ) and used immediately . ESCRT reactions . A 200 m l observation chamber ( Lab - Tek chambered # 1 . 0 Borosilicate ) was coated using 1mgml 2 1 BSA to avoid distortion of GUVs on contactwiththe bottomofthe chamberandrinsedwithbuffer ( 50mMTrisHCl , pH7 . 4 , 300mM NaCl ) . One - hundred microlitres of GUVs was mixed with this buffer and incubated for 5min . The buffer and all proteins added to GUVs matched the osmolarity of the GUV solution ( , 650mosM due to evaporation of , 10 % water during electro - formation at 60 u C ) . Vps20 ( full length , residues 1 2 221 ) or Vps20 D C ( C - terminal truncation , residues 1 2 170 ) were added to the GUV 2 buffer mixture to yield a final concentration of 160nM . The solution was stirred by a gentle rotation of the pipette tip , without aspiration . After 5min of incubation at room temperature , Snf7 ( final concentration of 600nM ) , Vps24 ( 200nM ) , Vps2 ( 200nM ) andVps4 ( 200nM ) wereaddedinthatorder , separated by5 - minincubationintervals . ForATPexperiments , ATPandMgCl 2 ( 2mMfinal concentration ) were added to the GUV / protein mixture . To establish uptake of the bulk phase , the soluble marker GFP was added as indicated , yielding a final concentrationof1 . 65 m M . Onebuffercontrolwasperformedforeachexperiment . Stirring and incubation times were the same for the control and ESCRT - III additions , and GFP was added to the control and ESCRT - III experiments in an identical manner . For Vps20 or Vps20 D C colocalization experiments a final con - centration of 30nM of Alexa - 488 - conjugated protein was used , but no other proteins were added . For Vps4 colocalization , the experiment was set up as described above , however , a mixture of unlabelled and labelled Vps4 ( 5 : 1 ) was added to a final total Vps4 concentration of 200nM .

Vps20 + Snf7 + Vps24 + Vps2 + Vps4 + ATP ADP Figure 6 | A simple hypothesis for the mechanism of the ESCRT - III 2 Vps4 membrane scission cycle . The spiral structure is inspired by the observations of ref . 20 . ESCRT - III sequesters cargo in MVBs , with Snf7 having the most important role of the four subunits 35 . Any cargo present in the neck near the growing array would be forced out of the neck and further into the bud at this stage , leading to its sequestration . Completion of the spiral would bring the membrane lipids of the neck into critical proximity , allowing fusion . The fused neck would then resolve into the detached vesicle ontheinteriorandtheESCRT - III - coatedlimitingmembraneontheexterior ( bottom panel ) .

The ESCRT - III subunits Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps24 and Vps2 were subcloned into a modified pHis2 expression vector , containing the Escherichia coli MBP gene in between a 5 9 His 6 - tag and a 3 9 TEVproteasecleavagesite . TheC - terminallytruncatedversionofVps20 ( Vps20 D C , residues1 2 170 ) wasgeneratedbyPCRusingtheVps20constructaboveasatemplate and was subcloned as for Vps20 . All constructs were transformed into Rosetta pLys cells ( Stratagene ) . N - terminalHis 6 2 MBPfusionproteinswereexpressedat30 u Cfor 3h in LB ( Luria Bertani ) medium supplemented with ampicillin ( 100 m gml 2 1 final concentration ) after induction with 0 . 5mM IPTG at an optical density ( D 600nm ) of 0 . 8 . TheproteinswereaffinitypurifiedusingNi - NTAresin ( Qiagen ) andelutedwith 100mM imidazole . Elution fractions were cleaved using TEV protease and further purifiedbySEC ( Superdex200column ) andasecondroundofchromatographyon Ni - NTAresin . PooledfractionsofSnf7werenotconcentratedtoavoidaggregationof themonomericprotein . ThefinalSnf7proteinconcentrationwasusuallybetween4 and8 m M . Allotherproteinswereconcentrateduntil , 50 m M . Purifiedproteinswere immediately flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2 80 u C until use . The monomeric state of all proteins was verified using analytical SEC before usage ( Superdex 200 10 / 30 column ; GE Healthcare ) . Full - length yeast Vps4 was purified from E . coli as a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein . After affinity - purification using glutathione resin and cleavage with TEV protease , the protein was subjected to SEC , and remnants of GST as well as TEV protease were removed by a second round of chromato - graphy using Ni - NTA and glutathione resin . The purified protein was concen - trated to 50 m M and stored at 2 80 u C . Light - scattering analysis . Protein samples ( 5 . 5mgml 2 1 of Vps20 and 1 . 7mgml - 1 of Vps20 D C ) were injected onto a TSK - GEL GMPWXL SEC ( Tosoh ) attached to an Agilent 1200 HPLC system ( Agilent Technologies ) using a 20 m l sample loop and a flow rate of 0 . 5mlmin - 1 . The eluted peaks were analysed using a Wyatt DAWN HELEOS - II multi - angle light - scattering instru - ment and a Wyatt Optilab rEX differential refractometer . Data were evaluated usingASTRA5 . 3 . 4softwareusingtheZimmmodelforstaticlightscatteringdata fitting . Vps20 and Vps20 D C were monodisperse and had experimental molecu - lar weights of 29 . 4 and 24 . 1kDa , respectively , as compared to their calculated molecular weights of 26 . 6 and 21 . 1kDa . Fluorescent labelling of proteins . To label Vps20 or Vps20 D C , which contain no native Cys residues , the mutant N85C was generated using the QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene ) . The purified and concentrated protein solution waslabelledbyincubatingAlexaFluor488C5maleimide ( MolecularProbes ) ata molar ratio of 1 : 1 with the protein at 37 u C for 1h under a N 2 atmosphere . The labelling incorporation was evaluated by running samples on an SDS - PAGE gel and carrying out fluorescence scans of the gel with a Typhoon variable mode imager ( GE - Healthcare ) using 488nm excitation and 495nm detection wave - lengths . Quantification of labelling efficiency was achieved by separating excess dye from labelled protein using two consecutive HiTrap desaltingcolumns ( GE - Healthcare ) . Molar protein and AlexaFluor488 concentrations of the purified proteinwere determinedusingabsorptionat 280and495nm , respectively . Vps4 contains two cysteine residues at positions 317 and 376 , which were used for the labelling reaction . The labelling and purification protocol was similar to that of the Vps20 constructs . Labelling efficiencies for all reactions exceeded 90 % . Lipids . The following lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids : POPS , POPC , cholesterol and 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( lissamine rhodamine B sulphonyl ) ( rhodamine - PE ) . Phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate and 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( diC16 ) were purchased from Echelon . POPS , POPC , cholesterol and rhodamine - PE were dissolved in chloroform . Phosphoinositides were dissolved in 1 : 2 : 0 . 8 chloroform : methanol : water . Confocal fluorescence microscopy . Images were taken in multi - tracking mode on a Zeiss LSM510 or LSM5 LiveDuo confocal microscope with a 3 63 Plan Apochromat 1 . 4NA objective and a 488 / 543 dichroic mirror at a resolution of 512 3 512pixels . TheGFPandAlexa488dyeswereexcitedusingthe488nmline and the rhodamine was excited with a 543nm HeNe laser . GFP and Alexa488 emissionwascollectedwitha505 2 530nmbandpassfilter . Rhodamineemission was collected with a 560nm longpass filter . The pinholes for each channel were set for an approximate 1 . 5 – 2 . 5 m m optical slice . Laser power was 9 m W for the 543nm channel and 24 , 400 or 810 m W for GFP bulk phase experiments , Vps20 colocalization or Vps4 colocalization , respectively , in the 488nm channel . Images were analysed using the LSM Examiner software . Enumerationof ILV formation . Randomlychosenfieldof viewswereevaluated to reveal the number of ILVs per GUV . Reactions were performed as described aboveandallGUVsintheparticularfieldsofviewwerescannedinthe z direction .
