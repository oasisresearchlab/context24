November , 1997 Revised : 19 . April , 1998 Universit(cid:127)at Dortmund Fachbereich Informatik Abstract This paper explores the use of Support Vector Machines ( SVMs ) for learning text classi - (cid:12)ers from examples . It analyzes the particular properties of learning with text data and identi(cid:12)es , why SVMs are appropriate for this task . Empirical results support the theoret - ical (cid:12)ndings . SVMs achieve substantial improvements over the currently best performing methods and they behave robustly over a variety of di(cid:11)erent learning tasks . Furthermore , they are fully automatic , eliminating the need for manual parameter tuning . 1 1 Introduction With the rapid growth of online information , text categorization has become one of the key techniques for handling and organizing text data . Text categorization is used to classify news stories [ Hayes and Weinstein , 1990 ] [ Masand et al . , 1992 ] , to (cid:12)nd interesting information on the WWW [ Lang , 1995 ] [ Balabanovic and Shoham , 1995 ] , and to guide a users search through hypertext [ Joachims et al . , 1997 ] . Since building text classi(cid:12)ers by hand is di(cid:14)cult and time consuming , it is desirable to learn classi(cid:12)ers from examples . In this paper I will explore and identify the bene(cid:12)ts of Support Vector Machines ( SVMs ) for text categorization . SVMs are a new learning method introduced by V . Vap - nik [ Vapnik , 1995 ] [ Cortes and Vapnik , 1995 ] [ Boser et al . , 1992 ] . They are well founded in terms of computational learning theory and very open to theoretical understanding and analysis . After reviewing the standard feature vector representation of text ( section 2 . 1 ) , I will identify the particular properties of text in this representation in section 2 . 3 . I will ar - gue that support vector machines are very well suited for learning in this setting . The empirical results in section 5 will support this claim . Compared to state - of - the - art meth - ods , SVMs show substantial performance gains . Moreover , in contrast to conventional text classi(cid:12)cation methods SVMs will prove to be very robust , eliminating the need for expensive parameter tuning . 2 Text Classi(cid:12)cation The goal of text categorization is the classi(cid:12)cation of documents into a (cid:12)xed number of prede(cid:12)ned categories . Each document d can be in multiple , exactly one , or no category at all . Using machine learning , the objective is to learn classi(cid:12)ers from examples which do the category assignments automatically . This is a supervised learning problem . To facilitate e(cid:11)ective and e(cid:14)cient learning , each category is treated as a separate binary classi(cid:12)cation problem . Each such problem answers the question , whether a document should be assigned to a particular category or not . 2 . 1 Representing Text The representation of a problem has a strong impact on the generalization accuracy of a learning system . Documents , which typically are strings of characters , have to be trans - formed into a representation suitable for the learning algorithm and the classi(cid:12)cation task . IR research suggests that word stems work well as representation units and that their or - dering in a document is of minor importance for many tasks . The word stem is derived from the occurrence form of a word by removing case and (cid:13)ection information [ Porter , 1980 ] . For example \ computes " , \ computing " , and \ computer " are all mapped to the same stem \ comput " . The terms \ word " and \ word stem " will be used synonymously in the following . This leads to an attribute - value representation of text . Each distinct word w i corre - sponds to a feature with TF ( w i ; d ) , the number of times word w i occurs in the document d , as its value . Figure 1 shows an example feature vector for a particular document .

Based on this basic representation it is known that scaling the dimensions of the feature vector with their inverse document frequency IDF ( wi ) [ Salton and Buckley , 1988 ] leads to an improved performance . IDF ( wi ) can be calculated from the document frequency DF ( wi ) , which is the number of documents the word wi occurs in . IDF ( wi ) = log (cid:18) n DF ( wi ) (cid:19) ( 1 ) Here , n is the total number of training documents . Intuitively , the inverse document frequency of a word is low if it occurs in many documents and is highest if the word occurs in only one . To abstract from di(cid:11)erent document lengths , each document feature vector ~ di is normalized to unit length . 2 . 2 Feature Selection In text categorization one is usually confronted with feature spaces containing 10000 di - mensions and more , often exceeding the number of available training examples . Many have noted the need for feature selection to make the use of conventional learning meth - ods possible , to improve generalization accuracy , and to avoid \ over(cid:12)tting " ( e . g . [ Yang and Pedersen , 1997 ] [ Moulinier et al . , 1996 ] ) . The most popular approach to feature selection is to select a subset of the available fea - tures using methods like DF - thresholding [ Yang and Pedersen , 1997 ] , the (cid:31) 2 - test [ Sch } utze et al . , 1995 ] , or the term strength criterion [ Yang and Wilbur , 1996 ] . The most commonly used and often most e(cid:11)ective [ Yang and Pedersen , 1997 ] method for selecting features is the information gain criterion . It will be used in this paper following the setup in [ Yang and Pedersen , 1997 ] . All words are ranked according to their information gain . To select a subset of f features , the f words with the highest mutual information are chosen . All other words will be ignored . 2 . 3 Why Should SVMs Work Well for Text Categorization ? 3 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 P r e c i s i on / R e c a ll - B r ea k e v en P o i n t Features ranked by Mutual Information BayesRandom Figure 2 : Learning without using the \ best " features . 2 . 3 Why Should SVMs Work Well for Text Categorization ? To (cid:12)nd out what methods are promising for learning text classi(cid:12)ers , we should (cid:12)nd out more about the properties of text . High dimensional input space : When learning text classi(cid:12)ers on has to deal with very many ( more than 10000 ) features . Since SVMs use over(cid:12)tting protection which does not necessarily depend on the number of features , they have the potential to handle these large feature spaces . Few irrelevant features : One way to avoid these high dimensional input spaces is to assume that most of the features are irrelevant . Feature selection tries to determine those . Unfortunately , in text categorization there are only very few irrelevant fea - tures . Figure 2 shows the results of an experiment on the Reuters \ acq " category ( see section 5 . 1 ) . All features are ranked according to their ( binary ) mutual infor - mation . Then a naive Bayes classi(cid:12)er ( see 4 . 1 ) is trained using only those features ranked 1 - 200 , 201 - 500 , 501 - 1000 , 1001 - 2000 , 2001 - 4000 , 4001 - 9947 . The results in (cid:12)gure 2 show that even features ranked lowest still contain considerable information and are somewhat relevant . A classi(cid:12)er using only those \ worst " features has a per - formance much better than random . Since it seems unlikely that all those features are completely redundant , this leads to the conjecture that a good classi(cid:12)er should combine many features ( learn a \ dense " concept ) and that feature selection is likely to hurt performance due to a loss of information . Document vectors are sparse : For each document d i , the corresponding document vector ~ d i contains only few entries which are not zero . Kivinen et al . [ Kivinen et al . , 1995 ] give both theoretical and empirical evidence for the mistake bound model that \ additive " algorithms , which have a similar inductive bias like SVMs , are well suited for problems with dense concepts and sparse instances . Most text categorization problems are linearly separable : All Ohsumed categories 4 3 SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES are linearly separable and so are many of the Reuters ( see section 5 . 1 ) tasks . Insep - arability on some Reuters categories is often due to dubious documents ( containing just the words \ blah blah blah " in the body ) or obvious misclassi(cid:12)cations of the human indexers . The idea of SVMs is to (cid:12)nd such linear ( or polynomial , RBF , etc . ) separators . These arguments give evidence that SVMs should perform well for text categorization . 3 Support Vector Machines Support vector machines are based on the Structural Risk Minimization principle [ Vapnik , 1995 ] from computational learning theory . The idea of structural risk minimization is to (cid:12)nd a hypothesis h for which we can guarantee the lowest true error . The true error of h is the probability that h will make an error on an unseen and randomly selected test example . The following upper bound connects the true error of a hypothesis h with the error of h on the training set and the complexity of h [ Vapnik , 1995 ] . P ( error ( h ) ) (cid:20) train error ( h ) + 2 s d ( ln 2 n d + 1 ) (cid:0) ln (cid:17) 4 n ( 2 ) The bound holds with probability at least 1 (cid:0) (cid:17) . n denotes the number of training examples and d is the VC - Dimension ( VCdim ) [ Vapnik , 1995 ] , which is a property of the hypothesis space and indicates its expressiveness . Equation ( 2 ) re(cid:13)ects the well known trade - o(cid:11) between the complexity of the hypothesis space and the training error . A simple hypothesis space ( small VCdim ) will probably not contain good approximating functions and will lead to a high training ( and true ) error . On the other hand a too rich hypothesis space ( high VCdim ) will lead to a small training error , but the second term in the right hand side of ( 2 ) will be large . This situation is commonly called \ over(cid:12)tting " . We can conclude that it is crucial to pick the hypothesis space with the \ right " complexity . In Structural Risk Minimization this is done by de(cid:12)ning a structure of hypothesis spaces Hi , so that their respective VC - Dimension di increases . H 1 (cid:26) H 2 (cid:26) H 3 (cid:26) : : : (cid:26) H i (cid:26) : : : and 8 i : d i (cid:20) d i + 1 ( 3 ) The goal is to (cid:12)nd the index i (cid:3) for which ( 2 ) is minimum . How can we build this structure of increasing VCdim ? In the following we will learn linear threshold functions of the type : h ( ~ d ) = sign f ~ w (cid:1) ~ d + b g = ( + 1 ; if ~ w (cid:1) ~ d + b > 0 (cid:0)1 ; else ( 4 ) Instead of building the structure based on the number of features using a feature selection strategy 1 , Support vector machines uses a re(cid:12)ned structure which acknowledges the fact that most features in text categorization are relevant . 1 Remember that linear threshold functions with n features have a VCdim of n + 1 . 5 h Figure 3 : Support vector machines (cid:12)nd the hyperplane h , which separates the positive and negative training examples with maximum margin . The examples closest to the hyperplane are called Support Vectors ( marked with circles ) . Lemma 1 . [ Vapnik , 1982 ] Consider hyperplanes h ( ~ d ) = signf ~ w(cid:1) ~ d + bg as hypotheses . If all example vectors ~ di are contained in a ball of radius R and it is required that for all examples ~ di j ~ w (cid:1) ~ di + bj (cid:21) 1 , with jj ~ wjj = A ( 5 ) then this set of hyperplane has a VCdim d bounded by d (cid:20) min ( [ R 2 A 2 ] ; n ) + 1 ( 6 ) Please note that the VCdim of these hyperplanes does not necessarily depend on the number of features ! Instead the VCdim depends on the Euclidean length jj ~ wjj of the weight vector ~ w . This means that we can generalize well in high dimensional spaces , if our hypothesis has a small weight vector . In their basic form support vector machines (cid:12)nd the hyperplane that separates the training data and which has the shortest weight vector . This hyperplane separates positive and negative training examples with maximum margin . Figure 3 illustrates this . Finding this hyperplane can be translated into the following optimization problem : Minimize : jj ~ wjj ( 7 ) so that : 8 i : y i [ ~ w (cid:1) ~ d i + b ] (cid:21) 1 ( 8 ) y i equals + 1 ( (cid:0)1 ) , if document d i is in class + ( (cid:0) ) . The constraints ( 8 ) require that all training examples are classi(cid:12)ed correctly . We can use the lemma from above to draw conclusions about the VCdim of the structure element that the separating hyperplane comes from . A bound similar to ( 2 ) [ Shawe - Taylor et al . , 1996 ] gives us a bound on the true error of this hyperplane on our classi(cid:12)cation task . Since the optimization problem from above is di(cid:14)cult to handle numerically , Lagrange multipliers are used to translate the problem into an equivalent quadratic optimization problem [ Vapnik , 1995 ] . Minimize : (cid:0) n X i = 1 (cid:11) i + 1 2 n X i ; j = 1 (cid:11) i (cid:11) j y i y j ~ d i (cid:1) ~ d j ( 9 ) 6 3 SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES so that : n X i = 1 (cid:11) i y i = 0 and 8i : (cid:11) i (cid:21) 0 ( 10 ) For this kind of optimization problem e(cid:14)cient algorithms exist , which are guaranteed to (cid:12)nd the global optimum 2 . The result of the optimization process is a set of coe(cid:14)cients (cid:11) (cid:3) i for which ( 9 ) is minimum . These coe(cid:14)cients can be used to construct the hyperplane ful(cid:12)lling ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) . ~ w(cid:1) ~ d = ( n X i = 1 (cid:11) (cid:3) i y i ~ d i ) (cid:1) ~ d = n X i = 1 (cid:11) (cid:3) i y i ( ~ d i (cid:1) ~ d ) and b = 1 2 ( ~ w(cid:1) ~ d + + ~ w(cid:1) ~ d(cid:0) ) ( 11 ) Equation ( 11 ) shows that the resulting weight vector of the hyperplane is constructed as a linear combination of the training examples . Only those examples contribute for which the coe(cid:14)cient (cid:11) i is greater than zero . Those vectors are called Support Vectors . In (cid:12)gure 3 the support vectors are marked with circles . They are those training examples which have minimum distance to the hyperplane . To calculate b , two arbitrary support vectors ~ d + and ~ d (cid:0) ( one from the class + and one from (cid:0) ) can be used . 3 . 1 Non - linear Hypothesis Spaces To learn nonlinear hypotheses , SVMs make use of convolution functions K ( ~ d 1 ; ~ d 2 ) . De - pending on the type of convolution function , SVMs learn polynomial classi(cid:12)ers , radial basis function ( RBF ) classi(cid:12)ers , or two layer sigmoid neural nets . Kpoly ( ~ d 1 ; ~ d 2 ) = ( ~ d 1 (cid:1) ~ d 2 + 1 ) d ( 12 ) Krbf ( ~ d 1 ; ~ d 2 ) = exp ( (cid:13) ( ~ d 1 (cid:0) ~ d 2 ) 2 ) ( 13 ) Ksigmoid ( ~ d 1 ; ~ d 2 ) = tanh ( s ( ~ d 1 (cid:1) ~ d 2 ) + c ) ( 14 ) These convolution functions satisfy Mercer’s Theorem ( see [ Vapnik , 1995 ] ) . This means that they compute the inner product of vectors ~ d 1 and ~ d 2 after they have been mapped into a new \ feature " space by a non - linear mapping (cid:8) : (cid:8) ( ~ d 1 ) (cid:1) (cid:8) ( ~ d 2 ) = K ( ~ d 1 ; ~ d 2 ) ( 15 ) To use a convolution function , simply substitute every occurrence of the inner product in equations ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) with the desired convolution function . The support vector machine then (cid:12)nds the hyperplane in the \ non - linear " feature space , which separates the training data with the widest margin . 3 . 2 Finding the Best Parameter Values With the use of convolution functions , parameters are introduced . For the polynomial convolution this is the degree d , for RBFs it is the variance (cid:13) , etc . How can we pick appropriate values for these parameters automatically ? The following procedure [ Vapnik , 2 For the experiments in this paper a re(cid:12)ned version of the algorithm in [ Osuna et al . , 1997 ] is used . It can e(cid:14)ciently handle problems with many thousand support vectors , converges fast , and has minimal memory requirements . 3 . 3 Non - Separable Problems 7 1995 ] can be used , which is again inspired by bound ( 2 ) . First train the support vector machine for di(cid:11)erent values of d and / or (cid:13) . Then estimate the VCdim of the hypotheses found using ( 6 ) and pick the one with the lowest VCdim . To compute the length of the weight vector one can use the formula jjwjj 2 = X i ; j 2 SupportVectors (cid:11) i (cid:11) j y i y j K ( ~ d1 ; ~ d j ) ( 16 ) And since all document vectors are normalized to unit length , it is easy to show that the radius R of the ball containing all training examples is tightly bound by Polynomial : R 2 (cid:20) 2 d (cid:0) 1 RBF : R 2 (cid:20) 2 ( 1 (cid:0) exp ( (cid:0)(cid:13) ) ) ( 17 ) Please note that this procedure for selecting the appropriate parameter values is fully automatic , does not look at the test data , and requires no expensive cross - validation . 3 . 3 Non - Separable Problems So far it was assumed that the training data is separable without error . What if this is not possible for the chosen hypothesis space ? Cortes and Vapnik [ Cortes and Vapnik , 1995 ] suggest the introduction of slack variables . In this paper a simpler approach is taken . During the optimization of ( 9 ) the values of the coe(cid:14)cients (cid:11)i are monitored . Training examples with high (cid:11)i \ contribute a lot to the inseparability " of the data . When the value of an (cid:11)i exceeds a certain threshold ( here (cid:11)i (cid:21) 1000 ) the corresponding training example is removed from the training set . The SVM is then trained on the remaining data . 4 Conventional Learning Methods This paper compares support vector machines to four standard methods , all of which have shown good results on text categorization problems in previous studies . Each method represents a di(cid:11)erent machine learning approach : density estimation using a naive Bayes classi(cid:12)er , the Rocchio algorithm as the most popular learning method from information retrieval , an instance based k - nearest neighbor classi(cid:12)er , and the C4 . 5 decision tree / rule learner . 4 . 1 Naive Bayes Classi(cid:12)er The idea of the naive Bayes classi(cid:12)er is to use a probabilistic model of text . To make the estimation of the parameters of the model possible , rather strong assumptions are incorporated . In the following , word - based unigram models of text will be used , i . e . words are assumed to occur independently of the other words in the document . The goal is to estimate Pr ( + j d 0 ) , the probability that a document d 0 is in class + . With perfect knowledge of Pr ( + j d 0 ) the optimum performance is achieved when d 0 is assigned to class + i(cid:11) Pr ( + j d 0 ) (cid:21) 0 : 5 ( Bayes’ rule ) . Using a unigram model of text leads to the following estimate of Pr ( + jd 0 ) ( see [ Joachims , 1997 ] ) : Pr ( + jd 0 ) = Pr ( + ) (cid:1) Q i Pr ( w i j + ) TF ( w i ; d 0 ) Pr ( + ) (cid:1) Q i Pr ( w i j + ) TF ( w i ; d 0 ) + Pr ( (cid:0) ) (cid:1) Q i Pr ( w i j(cid:0) ) TF ( w i ; d 0 ) ( 18 ) 8 5 EXPERIMENTS The probabilities P ( + ) and P ( (cid:0) ) can be estimated from the fraction of documents in the respective category . For Pr ( w i j + ) and Pr ( w i j(cid:0) ) the so called Laplace estimator is used [ Joachims , 1997 ] . 4 . 2 Rocchio Algorithm This type of classi(cid:12)er is based on the relevance feedback algorithm originally proposed by Rocchio [ Rocchio , 1971 ] for the vector space retrieval model [ Salton , 1991 ] . It has been extensively used for text classi(cid:12)cation . First , both the normalized document vectors of the positive examples as well as those of the negative examples are summed up . The linear component of the decision rule is then computed as ~ w = 1 j + j X i 2 + ~ d i (cid:0) (cid:12) 1 j (cid:0) j X j 2(cid:0) ~ d j ( 19 ) Rocchio requires that negative elements of the vector w are set to 0 . (cid:12) is a parameter that adjusts the relative impact of positive and negative training examples . The performance of the resulting classi(cid:12)er strongly depends on a \ good " choice of (cid:12) . To classify a new document d 0 , the cosine between ~ w and ~ d 0 is computed . Using an appropriate threshold on the cosine leads to a binary classi(cid:12)cation rule . 4 . 3 k - Nearest Neighbors k - nearest neighbor ( k - NN ) classi(cid:12)ers were found to show very good performance on text categorization tasks [ Yang , 1997 ] [ Masand et al . , 1992 ] . This paper follows the setup in [ Yang , 1997 ] . The cosine is used as a similarity metric . knn ( d 0 ) denotes the indexes of the k documents which have the highest cosine with the document to classify d 0 . Hknn ( d 0 ) = sign ( P i 2 knn ( d 0 ) yi cos ( d 0 ; di ) P i 2 knn ( d 0 ) cos ( d 0 ; di ) ) ( 20 ) Further details can be found in [ Mitchell , 1997 ] . 4 . 4 Decision Tree Classi(cid:12)er The C4 . 5 [ Quinlan , 1993 ] decision tree algorithm is used for the experiments in this paper . It is the most popular decision tree algorithm and has shown good results on a variety of problem . It is used with the default parameter settings and with rule post - pruning turned on . C4 . 5 outputs a con(cid:12)dence value when classifying new examples . This value is used to compute precision / recall tables ( see section 5 . 2 ) . Previous results with decision tree or rule learning algorithms are reported in [ Lewis and Ringuette , 1994 ] [ Moulinier et al . , 1996 ] . 5 Experiments The following experiments compare the performance of SVMs using polynomial and RBF convolution operators with the four conventional learning methods . 5 . 1 Test Collections 9 5 . 1 Test Collections The empirical evaluation is done on two test collection . The (cid:12)rst one is the Reuters - 21578 dataset ( http : / / www . research . att . com / lewis / reuters21578 . html ) compiled by David Lewis and originally collected by the Carnegie group from the Reuters newswire in 1987 . The \ ModApte " split is used leading to a corpus of 9603 training documents and 3299 test documents . Of the 135 potential topic categories only those 90 are used for which there is at least one training and one test example . After stemming and stop - word removal , the training corpus contains 9947 distinct terms which occur in at least three documents . The Reuters - 21578 collection is know for a rather direct correspondence between words and categories . For the category \ wheat " for example , the occurrence of the word \ wheat " in a document is an very good predictor . The second test collection is taken from the Ohsumed corpus ( ftp : / / medir . ohsu . edu / pub / ohsumed ) compiled by William Hersh . Here the connection between words and categories is less direct . From the 50216 documents in 1991 which have abstracts , the (cid:12)rst 10000 are used for training and the second 10000 are used for testing . The classi(cid:12)cation task considered here is to assign the documents to one or multiple categories of the 23 MeSH \ diseases " categories . A document belongs to a category if it is indexed with at least one indexing term from that category . After stemming and stop - word removal , the training corpus contains 15561 distinct terms which occur in at least three documents . 5 . 2 Performance Measures Despite theoretical problems and a certain arbitrariness , the Precision / Recall - Breakeven Point is used as a measure of performance to stay ( at least to some extend ) compatible with previously published results . The precision / recall - breakeven point is based on the two well know statistics recall and precision widely used in information retrieval . Both apply to binary classi(cid:12)cation problems . Precision is the probability that a document predicted to be in class \ + " truly belongs to this class . Recall is the probability that a document belonging to class \ + " is classi(cid:12)ed into this class . Between high recall and high precision exists a trade - o(cid:11) . All methods examined in this paper make category assignments by thresholding a \ con(cid:12)dence value " . By adjusting this threshold we can achieve di(cid:11)erent levels of recall and precision . The PRR method [ Raghavan et al . , 1989 ] is used for interpolation . Since precision and recall are de(cid:12)ned only for binary classi(cid:12)cation tasks , the results of multiple binary tasks need to be averaged to get to a single performance value for multiple class problems . This will be done using microaveraging [ Yang , 1997 ] . In our setting this results in the following procedure . The classi(cid:12)cation threshold (cid:2) is lowered simultaneously over all binary tasks 3 . At each value of (cid:2) the microaveraged precision and recall are computed based on the merged contingency table . To arrive at this merged table , the contingency tables of all binary tasks at (cid:2) are added componentwise . The precision / recall breakeven point is now de(cid:12)ned as that value for which precision and recall are equal . Note that there may be multiple breakeven points or none at all . In the case of multiple breakeven points , the lowest one is selected . In case of no breakeven 3 Since cosine similarities are not comparable across classes , the method of proportional assignment [ Wiener et al . , 1995 ] is used for the Rocchio algorithm to come up with improved con(cid:12)dence values . 10 5 EXPERIMENTS SVM ( poly ) SVM ( rbf ) d = (cid:13) = Bayes Rocchio C4 . 5 k - NN 1 2 3 4 5 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 earn 95 . 9 96 . 1 96 . 1 97 . 3 98 . 2 98 . 4 98 . 5 98 . 4 98 . 3 98 . 5 98 . 5 98 . 4 98 . 3 acq 91 . 5 92 . 1 85 . 3 92 . 0 92 . 6 94 . 6 95 . 2 95 . 2 95 . 3 95 . 0 95 . 3 95 . 3 95 . 4 money - fx 62 . 9 67 . 6 69 . 4 78 . 2 66 . 9 72 . 5 75 . 4 74 . 9 76 . 2 74 . 0 75 . 4 76 . 3 75 . 9 grain 72 . 5 79 . 5 89 . 1 82 . 2 91 . 3 93 . 1 92 . 4 91 . 3 89 . 9 93 . 1 91 . 9 91 . 9 90 . 6 crude 81 . 0 81 . 5 75 . 5 85 . 7 86 . 0 87 . 3 88 . 6 88 . 9 87 . 8 88 . 9 89 . 0 88 . 9 88 . 2 trade 50 . 0 77 . 4 59 . 2 77 . 4 69 . 2 75 . 5 76 . 6 77 . 3 77 . 1 76 . 9 78 . 0 77 . 8 76 . 8 interest 58 . 0 72 . 5 49 . 1 74 . 0 69 . 8 63 . 3 67 . 9 73 . 1 76 . 2 74 . 4 75 . 0 76 . 2 76 . 1 ship 78 . 7 83 . 1 80 . 9 79 . 2 82 . 0 85 . 4 86 . 0 86 . 5 86 . 0 85 . 4 86 . 5 87 . 6 87 . 1 wheat 60 . 6 79 . 4 85 . 5 76 . 6 83 . 1 84 . 5 85 . 2 85 . 9 83 . 8 85 . 2 85 . 9 85 . 9 85 . 9 corn 47 . 3 62 . 2 87 . 7 77 . 9 86 . 0 86 . 5 85 . 3 85 . 7 83 . 9 85 . 1 85 . 7 85 . 7 84 . 5 84 . 2 85 . 1 85 . 9 86 . 2 85 . 9 86 . 4 86 . 5 86 . 3 86 . 2 microavg . 72 . 0 79 . 9 79 . 4 82 . 3 combined : 86 . 0 combined : 86 . 4 Figure 4 : Precision / recall - breakeven point on the ten most frequent Reuters categories and microaveraged performance over all Reuters categories . k - NN , Rocchio , and C4 . 5 achieve highest performance at 1000 features ( with k = 30 for k - NN and (cid:12) = 1 : 0 for Rocchio ) . Naive Bayes performs best using all features . point it is de(cid:12)ned to be zero . 5 . 3 Results Figures 4 and 5 show the results on the Reuters 4 and the Ohsumed corpus . To make sure that the results for the conventional methods are not biased by an inappropriate choice of parameters , extensive experimentation was done . All four methods were run after selecting the 500 best , 1000 best , 2000 best , 5000 best , ( 10000 best , ) or all features ( see section ? ? ) . At each number of features the values (cid:12) 2 f0 ; 0 : 1 ; 0 : 25 ; 0 : 5 ; 1 : 0g for the Rocchio algorithm and k 2 f1 ; 15 ; 30 ; 45 ; 60g for the k - NN classi(cid:12)er were tried . The results for the parameters with the best performance on the test set are reported . On the Reuters data the k - NN classi(cid:12)er performs best among the conventional methods ( see (cid:12)gure 4 ) . This replicates the (cid:12)ndings of [ Yang , 1997 ] . Slightly worse perform the decision tree method and the Rocchio algorithm . The naive Bayes classi(cid:12)er shows the worst results . Compared to the conventional methods all SVMs perform better independent of the choice of parameters . Even for complex hypotheses spaces , like polynomials of degree 5 , no over(cid:12)tting occurs despite using all 9947 features . This demonstrates the ability of SVMs to handle large feature spaces without feature selection . The numbers printed in bold in (cid:12)gure 4 mark the parameter setting with the lowest VCdim estimate as described in section 3 . 2 . The results show that this strategy is well suited to pick a good parameter setting automatically . Computing the microaveraged precision / recall - breakeven point over the hypotheses with the lowest VCdim per class leads to a performance of 85 . 6 for the polynomials and 86 . 3 for the radial basis functions . This is a substantial improvement over the best performing conventional method at its best parameter setting . The RBF 4 The results for the Reuters corpus are revised . In the experiments for an earlier version of this report the articles marked with \ UNPROC " were parsed in a way that the body was ignored . 11 SVM ( poly ) SVM ( rbf ) d = (cid:13) = Bayes Rocchio C4 . 5 k - NN 1 2 3 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Pathology 52 . 7 50 . 8 47 . 6 53 . 4 50 . 3 54 . 9 57 . 2 58 . 2 56 . 7 57 . 4 58 . 1 Cardiovascular 72 . 4 70 . 1 70 . 5 72 . 6 71 . 1 76 . 2 77 . 6 77 . 3 77 . 2 77 . 5 77 . 6 Immunologic 61 . 7 58 . 0 58 . 8 66 . 8 69 . 7 73 . 2 73 . 5 73 . 2 73 . 3 73 . 5 73 . 5 Neoplasms 63 . 6 64 . 1 58 . 7 67 . 2 64 . 1 69 . 4 70 . 1 70 . 6 70 . 5 70 . 6 70 . 7 Digestive System 65 . 3 59 . 9 59 . 0 67 . 1 70 . 3 73 . 3 74 . 5 73 . 7 74 . 3 74 . 1 73 . 8 60 . 7 64 . 7 65 . 9 65 . 9 65 . 7 66 . 0 66 . 1 microavg . 57 . 0 56 . 6 50 . 0 59 . 1 combined : 65 . 9 combined : 66 . 0 Figure 5 : Precision / recall - breakeven point on the (cid:12)ve most frequent Ohsumed categories and microaveraged performance over all Ohsumed categories . k - NN , Rocchio , and Bayes achieve highest performance using all features ( with k = 45 for k - NN and (cid:12) = 1 : 0 for Rocchio ) . C4 . 5 performs best using 500 features . Support Vector machine is better than k - NN on 62 of the 90 categories ( 20 ties ) , which is a signi(cid:12)cant improvement according to the binomial sign test . The results for the Ohsumed collection are similar ( (cid:12)gure 5 ) . Again k - NN is the best conventional method . C4 . 5 fails on this task and heavy over(cid:12)tting is observed when using more than 500 features . Again the SVMs perform substantially better than all other methods . The RBF support vector machine outperforms k - NN on all 23 categories , which is again a signi(cid:12)cant improvement . On both the Reuters and the Ohsumed collection the RBF convolution performs slightly better than the polynomial convolution . Comparing training time , SVMs are roughly comparable to C4 . 5 , but they are more expensive than naive Bayes , Rocchio , and k - NN . Nevertheless , current research is likely to improve e(cid:14)ciency of SVM - type quadratic programming problems . SVMs are faster than k - NN at classi(cid:12)cation time , especially when using the reduced set [ Burges and Sch(cid:127)olkopf , 1997 ] method . 6 Conclusions This paper introduces support vector machines for text categorization . It provides both theoretical and empirical evidence that SVMs are very well suited for text categorization . The theoretical analysis concludes that SVMs acknowledge the particular properties of text : ( a ) high dimensional feature spaces , ( b ) most of the features are relevant ( dense concept vector ) , and ( c ) sparse instance vectors . The experimental results show that SVMs consistently achieve good performance on categorization tasks , outperforming existing methods substantially and signi(cid:12)cantly . With their ability to generalize well in high dimensional feature spaces , SVMs eliminate the need for feature selection making the application of text categorization considerably easier . Another advantage of SVMs over the conventional methods is their robustness . SVMs show good performance in all experiments avoiding catastrophic failure like observed for the conventional methods on some tasks . Furthermore , SVMs do not require any parameter tuning , since they can (cid:12)nd good parameter settings automatically . All this makes SVMs a very promising and easy to use method for learning text classi(cid:12)ers from examples . 12 REFERENCES 7 Acknowledgements Many thanks to my advisor Prof .
