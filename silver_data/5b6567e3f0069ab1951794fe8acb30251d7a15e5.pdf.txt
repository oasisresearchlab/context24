Received : 3 December 2009 ; in revised form : 31 December 2009 / Accepted : 14 January 2010 / Published : 15 January 2010 Abstract : By modulating important properties of eukaryotic cells , many bacterial protein toxins highjack host signalling pathways to create a suitable niche for the pathogen to colonize and persist . Helicobacter pylori VacA is paradigm of pore - forming toxins which contributes to the pathogenesis of peptic ulceration . Several cellular receptors have been described for VacA , which exert different effects on epithelial and immune cells . The crystal structure of VacA p55 subunit might be important for elucidating details of receptor interaction and pore formation . Here we discuss the multiple signalling activities of this important toxin and the molecular crosstalk between VacA and other virulence factors .

Introduction Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) is a highly successful pathogen that is estimated to persistently colonize the stomach of about half of the human world population . This bacterium has been recognized as the causative agent of chronic gastric inflammation , peptic ulcer disease , mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma or gastric cancer [ 1 – 6 ] . The clinical outcome of Hp infections is determined by a complex scenario of host - pathogen interactions . The cellular and molecular mechanisms used by Hp to subvert host defences have been investigated intensively over the last few years . Disease development is dependent on several parameters including both the genotype of the bacteria and OPEN ACCESS Toxins 2010 , 2 70 genetic predisposition of the host , as well as environmental factors [ 7 – 12 ] . Hp isolates from different geographical origin are surprisingly diverse both in their genome sequences and their pathogenicity . Dozens of bacterial factors have been shown to influence Hp pathogenesis including the flagella , urease , catalase , neutrophil - activating protein NapA , peptidoglycan , several adhesins ( e . g . , SabA , BabA , AlpA / B , OipA ) and many others [ 1 , 13 – 16 ] . They can be classified as colonization factors ( also called pathogenicity - associated factors ) and virulence factors having direct cell - damaging capabilities . However , the two major disease - associated components are the vacuolating cytotoxin ( VacA ) and the cag ( cytotoxin - associated genes ) pathogenicity island ( cag PAI ) . The gene encoding vacA is present in virtually all Hp strains , which suggests that the production of VacA plays an important role in the colonization or persistence of Hp in the human stomach [ 1 , 7 – 9 , 17 ] . The cag PAI is a 40 kb stretch of DNA , which was acquired by a horizontal DNA transfer event from yet unknown donor , and encodes components of a sophisticated type IV secretion system ( T4SS ) . This T4SS forms a pilus for the injection of virulence factors into host target cells such as the CagA effector protein [ 7 , 11 , 12 , 18 – 20 ] . Injected CagA mimics a host cell protein in binding and activation of multiple signalling factors and induces actin - cytoskeletal rearrangements ( cell elongation ) , disruption of cell - to - cell junctions ( cell scattering ) as well as proliferative , pro - inflammatory and anti - apoptotic nuclear responses [ 11 , 20 – 23 ] . In addition , Hp induces several T4SS - dependent but CagA - independent signalling events such as the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR [ 24 , 25 ] and the small Rho GTPase Rac1 [ 26 – 28 ] . The role of CagA and the T4SS have been discussed in numerous recent reviews [ 7 , 11 , 12 , 20 ] . Here we review the recent findings on the VacA structure and the various pathways how VacA highjacks host cell signalling cascades . We will also discuss a set of novel findings on the molecular crosstalk between VacA and CagA . 2 . VacA Expression , Secretion , Maturation and Allelic Variation An early work by Leunk and colleagues [ 29 ] discovered that broth - culture supernatants of Hp strains contained a proteinaceous cytotoxin that induced cytoplasmic vacuolation when incubated with eukaryotic cells in vitro . Multiple cell types from human and animal species were susceptible to its toxic activity , albeit with great differences . The structural organization of VacA closely resembles that of IgA protease - like factors secreted by pathogenic Neisseriae and Haemophilus species [ 9 ] , which are today known as the autotransporter or type V secretion family of proteins [ 18 ] . Like many other classical autotransporters , VacA contains a 33 - amino acid signal sequence and undergoes cleavage during the transport across bacterial membranes ( Figure 1 ) . VacA genes are predicted to encode a translated protein of about 135 – 145 kDa depending on the strain . However , VacA proteins of this molecular weight have never been reported [ 8 ] . Instead , three VacA protein spots of the Hp strain 26695 were identified by two - dimensional gel electrophoresis ( 2 - DE ) . The most predominant VacA protein spots on 2 – DE gels were approximately 95 . 7 kDa and 87 . 9 kDa in size , and were found both in fractions of the Hp membrane and culture supernatant [ 30 , 31 ] . In addition , a 10 . 5 kDa VacA spot was found in the secreted protein fraction [ 30 ] . Mass spectrometry of the identified peptides are consistent with a model that the 95 . 7 kDa VacA protein is the secreted toxin which is then cleaved into the 87 . 9 kDa mature protein ( p88 ) and the 10 . 5 kDa passenger domain ( p10 , also known as the alpha - protein ) ( Figure 1 ) . The exact cleavage site between p88 and p10 was detected between position 991 and 992 [ 30 ] . The processed beta - domain of the autotransporter subunit was not detected by 2 – DE , but Toxins 2010 , 2 71 has been observed in total cell lysates [ 32 ] . However , the mature translocated p88 domain can undergo further proteolytic cleavage to yield two fragments , known as p33 and p55 ( Figure 1 , bottom ) . The latter two processing products are believed to represent the functional domains of VacA ( see below ) . Thus , VacA may exhibit some properties resembling those of classical A / B - toxins . Interestingly , while cleavage between p33 and p55 subunits has been seen in vitro [ 33 ] , no cleavage in vivo could be detected [ 34 ] . A possible explanation is that the rate of VacA cleavage in vivo is too low to be observed . In some studies , VacA and its domains have slightly different sizes , but we will use the p33 and p55 nomenclature throughout this review . However , the basis of vacA size and sequence variation was found in several alleles that have been identified in the signal region ( genotypes s1 and s2 ) and in the mid region ( genotypes m1 and m2 ) , occurring in all possible combinations [ 1 , 7 – 9 ] . In addition , two intermediate region variants ( called i1 and i2 ) were identified as other important determinants of VacA toxicity [ 35 ] . VacA proteins of the s2 type are inactive in assays for the vacuolating phenotype , while type s1 / ml alleles produce extensive vacuolation in a large array of cell categories and type s1 / m2 allels induce detectable vacuolation in a more limited range of cell types , which is in concurrence with its location in p55 as the cellular binding domain of VacA [ 36 , 37 ] . Figure 1 . VacA domain structure and processing products . The amino - terminal signal sequence ( SS ) and carboxy - terminal domain are cleaved from the full - length 135 – 140 kDa VacA protein to yield a 98 kDa secreted toxin ( p98 ) that is transported into the extracellular space via the autotransporter mechanism . Proteins of this autotransporter family are able to mediate their own secretion without the need of additional bacterial proteins . The 33 kDa carboxy - terminal beta - barrel domain of VacA is predicted to insert into the outer membrane and to form a channel , through which the mature VacA toxin is secreted . The secreted toxin can be processed into the mature toxin ( p88 ) and p10 . The mature , secreted p88 subunit can undergo further limited proteolytic cleavage to yield two additional fragments , p33 and p55 [ 7 , 8 , 32 ] . The latter two processing products are considered to represent the functional domains or subunits of VacA . Toxins 2010 , 2 72 3 . Domains of VacA and Crystal Structure of the p55 Subunit In response to acidic pH , VacA undergoes a structural change , which increases its cellular activity and renders it resistant to proteolysis by pepsin [ 38 ] . The relevance of the pH , however , is still not fully understood because VacA has also been shown to be activated at alkaline pH [ 39 ] . In fact , it appears that only highly purified VacA is poorly active and needs to be activated by pH change , but this is not necessary during infection or when VacA is simply collected from the bacterial supernatant ( broth culture filtrate ) . Thus , VacA secreted by the bacteria is most likely fully active independently of the luminal gastric pH . This is in agreement with the fact that the mucus layer close to the gastric epithelium , in which Hp resides , is at a mild acidic pH . However , the secreted p88 subunit of VacA can assemble into water - soluble oligomeric structures [ 33 , 40 ] , and can insert into planar lipid bilayers to form anion - selective membrane channels [ 41 – 43 ] . These structures resemble a flower - like configuration ( Figure 2B ) . Interestingly , low pH treatment of these oligomeric structures break them apart releasing VacA monomers [ 40 ] . The first reported high - resolution images were 19 – Å cryo electron microscopy maps of VacA dodecamers [ 44 ] , and atomic - force microscopy and electrophysiological studies implied that VacA membrane channels are single - layered structures [ 41 , 43 ] . When the p33 and p55 domains are expressed separately and then mixed , p33 and p55 can physically interact and restore vacuolating activity in epithelial cells [ 45 – 47 ] . The p33 subunit contains a hydrophobic stretch ( amino acids 6 – 27 ) which is involved in pore formation and / or membrane insertion [ 48 , 49 ] , whereas p55 contains one or more cell interaction sites [ 36 , 37 , 50 ] . Recently , the 2 . 4 - Å crystal structure of p55 has been published [ 51 ] . The structure is predominantly a right - handed parallel β - helix , a feature which is characteristic of autotransporter passenger subunits but unique among other known toxins ( Figure 2A - C ) . Notable features of p55 include disruption of β - sheet contacts which result in five β - helix subdomains and a carboxy - terminal domain that contains a disulfide - bond . Gangwer et al . [ 51 ] proposed an oligomerization model in which p33 interacts with the amino - terminal portion of p55 from the neighboring subunit . Regions of contact between p33 and p55 are depicted with dashed lines ( Figure 2B , right structure ) . On the left in Figure 2C , the upper circle highlights three loops that mediate p55 – p55 contacts between the two layers . The lower circle indicates the two loops that line the conserved pocket that were proposed as a common receptor - binding site [ 51 ] . This pocket is located on the side of the molecule and would therefore be accessible in both single - layered and bilayered forms of the toxin . The circle in the middle contains the other conserved surface in p55 . This surface protrudes into the central ring of the VacA oligomer and would be accessible to the molecule for contacts that could mediate oligomerization within a hexameric or heptameric plane . The enlarged section to the right in Figure 2C shows the secondary structures that contribute to this surface . Again , p55 contains the aforementioned m1 / m2 alleles , and investigation of VacA sequences from unrelated Hp strains allowed the identification of structural surface features which may be important for interactions with host cell receptors [ 51 ] . Toxins 2010 , 2 73 Figure 2 . Molecular structure of VacA . ( A ) The p55 domain of VacA adopts a β - helix structure that is composed of three parallel β - sheets connected by loops of varying length and structure [ 51 ] . The carboxy - terminal domain contains a mixture of α / β secondary structure elements and contains a disulfide bond . The carboxy - terminus of the β - helix ( right , rotated by 90° ) is capped by a β - hairpin from the carboxy - terminal domain and the α1− helix located in one of the long helix loops . ( B ) Docking the p55 crystal structure into a 19 - Å cryo electron microscopy map of the VacA dodecamer results in a model for oligomerization . Twelve p55 subunits are shown docked into a 19 - Å cryo - EM map of a VacA dodecamer [ 44 ] . An arrow is shown to indicate the space that the upper molecule will occupy if p33 extends the β - helix structure of p55 . The inset shows EM images of a VacA hexamer and a VacA monomer [ 44 ] . The shape of a VacA hexamer ( inset ) is similar to the shape of a single layer within the dodecamer [ 44 ] . The rod - like shape of the p88 monomer ( inset ) supports a model in which the β - helix of p55 will extend into p33 . ( C ) The view from the left structure in panel B is rotated by 90° .

VacA Targets Various Surface Factors Both on Epithelial and Immune Cells The cellular effects of VacA have been investigated intensively both in vivo and in vitro . A simplified model for the complex interactions of VacA with multiple cell types and downstream signalling cascades is presented in Figure 3A - L , while known host cell binding partners are summarized in Table 1 . Like many other bacterial toxins , VacA interacts with the plasma membrane of susceptible cells as a first step during intoxication ( Figure 3A ) . Following cell binding , VacA is internalized by a pinocytic - like and clathrin - independent mechanism [ 52 , 53 ] . A remarkable feature of VacA is that it can target multiple cell - surface components in vitro or on epithelial cells including RPTP - alpha [ 54 ] , RPTP - beta [ 39 , 55 ] , various lipids [ 56 , 57 , 41 ] , heparin sulphate [ 58 ] , sphingomyelin [ 59 ] , fibronectin [ 60 ] , the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) [ 61 ] as well as integrin β 2 ( CD18 ) on T cells [ 62 ] . Determining which of these factors is required for VacA uptake and subversion of cellular signalling has been a challenging topic of research and is still not fully studied for each factor . However , the importance of RPTP’s for VacA - dependent activities has been investigated in much detail . For example , VacA causes gastric injury in wild - type mice but not in the RPTP - beta knockout mice [ 55 ] . This indicates that interaction of VacA with RPTP - beta on the surface of gastric epithelial cells is mechanistically important in VacA - induced gastric injury . Remarkably , VacA can still induce vacuolation in cultured gastric epithelial cells from RPTP - beta knockout mice or in G401 human kidney cells , which do not express RPTP - beta [ 54 , 55 ] , but inhibition of RPTP - beta expression by silencing oligonucleotides in HL - 60 cells downregulated VacA - induced vacuolation [ 63 ] . These data suggest that RPTP - beta exhibits crucial functions in the process of VacA - induced signalling but not necessarily vacuolation itself . Addition of VacA to target cells has been also shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of G - protein - coupled receptor - kinase - interacting protein - 1 ( Git - 1 ) and lipid - raft dependent downstream signalling [ 55 , 64 ] . In line with these observations , VacA was reported to bind to the QTTQP - motif in the extracellular domain of RPTP - beta , which was also necessary for inducing Git - 1 phosphorylation [ 54 ] . Another reported consequence of VacA - binding to RPTP - beta is detachment of primary murine gastric epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix [ 55 ] . Furthermore , VacA has been shown to interact with lipid preparations and artificial membranes , but the specificity and importance of VacA - lipid interactions for toxin function was unknown until recently . A new study provided evidence that sphingomyelin modulates the sensitivity of epithelial cells to VacA [ 59 ] . Sphingomyelin is a key structural component of the cell membrane ( in particular lipid rafts ) , while at the same time serving a functional role , as it is the parental compound of various lipid mediators . In fact , sphingomyelin was shown to be required for VacA’s association with lipid rafts on the plasma membrane and binding to cells , suggesting that sphingomyelin functions as a receptor molecule of VacA on the epithelial cell surface [ 59 ] . However , VacA does not only interact with gastric epithelial cells , but also with immune cells including B cells , T cells and macrophages ( Figure 3J - L ) . Interestingly , VacA efficiently enters activated , migrating primary human T lymphocytes by binding to the integrin β 2 ( CD18 ) receptor and exploiting the recycling of LFA - 1 , the lymphocyte function - associated molecule - 1 [ 62 ] . LFA - 1 - deficient Jurkat T - cells were resistant to vacuolation , and genetic complementation of LFA - 1 restored the sensitivity of cells to VacA . Remarkably , VacA targeted human CD18 for cell entry , but not its murine counterpart . These findings are consistent with the species - specific adaptation of Hp in its human host [ 62 ] .

Toxins 2010 , 2 76 5 . VacA Activities on Endosomal Maturation and Cell Vacuolation As mentioned above , the first identified activity of VacA was its ability to induce vacuolation in numerous eukaryotic cell types [ 29 ] . A current model for vacuole formation suggests that VacA binds to the plasma membrane of host cells , forms anion - selective channels in the plasma membrane , becomes internalized into endosomes and the vacuoles finally arise by swelling due to osmotic imbalance of the late endosomal compartments ( Figure 3C ) . In fact , VacA - induced vacuoles constitute hybrid compartments of late endosomal origin that contain some lysosomal markers , and their formation strictly depends on the presence of weak bases such as ammonia , which can be provided by urease activity [ 34 , 70 ] . To achieve this goal , VacA is first pinocytosed in a manner dependent on the small Rho GTPase Cdc42 [ 53 ] , and is subsequently routed into early endosomal compartments which are enriched with glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins [ 52 , 53 ] . These early endosomes are also associated with dynamic polymerised ( filamentous ) actin structures [ 71 ] . The CD2 - associated protein ( CD2AP ) , a docking protein implicated in intracellular trafficking , bridged the filamentous actin with early endosomes containing VacA . Interestingly , CD2AP regulated these actin structures and was required to transfer VacA from early to late endosomes and vacuolation [ 71 ] . Vacuole formation further depends on the presence and activity of a number of other signalling factors including V - ATPase [ 72 ] , Rab7 [ 73 ] and Rac1 [ 74 ] . Recent studies showed that at least the role of Rac1 in vacuole formation is due to the fact that Rac1 is required for binding of VacA to the cell membrane [ 53 ] . However , protein kinase PIKfyve is also necessary for vacuole production , and microinjection of its substrate phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) was demonstrated to be sufficient for vacuole formation [ 75 ] , whereas involvement of the SNARE protein syntaxin - 7 is controversial [ 76 , 77 ] . Also , the role of dynamin in large VacA - dependent vacuole formation is controversial . Dynamin has been shown to play either no role [ 52 ] or is fully necessary for cell vacuolation [ 78 ] . When expressed intracellularly , the minimum segment of VacA required for vacuolating activity comprises the entire p33 subunit and about 110 amino acids from the amino - terminus of p55 [ 45 , 79 ] . Vacuolating activity also requires di - or oligomerization of VacA [ 80 , 81 ] and depends on the hydrophobic amino - terminus ( about 30 amino acids ) containing three tandem GXXXG - sequences which are transmembrane dimerization motifs [ 49 , 82 ] . These requirements suggest that channel formation is a prerequisite for vacuolation . This conclusion is also supported by the observation that small anion - channel inhibitors effectively block vacuole production [ 83 ] . 6 . Amino - Terminal VacA Targets Mitochondria to Induce Apoptosis Infection of epithelial target cells with Hp has been associated with both increased and reduced levels of apoptosis [ 1 , 2 , 7 ] . In vitro , Hp reproducibly stimulates apoptosis in infected gastric epithelial cells , and this has also been seen in tissues isolated from infected patients or animal models [ 1 , 2 ] . Early studies indicated that purified VacA induced mitochondrial damage as indicated by a significant drop in ATP levels within cells [ 84 ] , and was then discovered to induce apoptosis by a mitochondrial pathway [ 85 ] . In the latter study , HEp - 2 cells were transfected with different VacA constructs , and the p33 subunit was found to localize specifically to mitochondria , whereas p55 remained cytosolic . When purified VacA was co - incubated with isolated mitochondria , p33 ( but not p55 ) was translocated into these organelles . In addition , transient expression of p33 - GFP or full - length VacA - GFP in HeLa cells Toxins 2010 , 2 77 induced the dramatic release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activated apoptotic caspase - 3 ( Figure 3F ) , as determined by the cleavage of poly - ADP - ribose polymerase , PARP . Cleavage of PARP was antagonized specifically by co - transfection of DNA vectors expressing Bcl - 2 , a factor known to inhibit mitochondria - associated apoptotic signals [ 85 ] . These observations were further supported by infection studies using wild - type Hp and Δ vacA mutant strains [ 86 , 87 ] . Remarkably , the s1 / m1 allel of VacA induced high levels of apoptosis while s2 / m1 toxin and truncated VacA mutants lacking the hydrophobic region near the amino - terminus did not . These results suggest that VacA can trigger gastric epithelial cell apoptosis and implicate that differences in levels of gastric mucosal epithelial apoptosis among Hp - infected individuals may arise from strain - dependent vacA sequence variation . Interestingly , studies in MKN - 28 cells showed that , unlike cell vacuolation , neither apoptosis nor change of mitochondrial transmembrane potential induced by VacA require ammonia [ 88 ] . The latter findings make unlikely the hypothesis that ammonia - dependent swelling and rupture of endosomal vesicles in which VacA is sequestered after cellular uptake may allow the toxin to reach mitochondria and trigger apoptosis , and therefore requires a different pathway . 7 . VacA and Other Factors Affecting the Transepithelial Resistance of Polarized Cell Monolayers An important feature of intact polarized cells is the development of transepithelial electrical resistance ( TER ) , a measurable indicator of epithelial integrity . When purified VacA ( acid - activated ) was incubated with polarized host cell monolayers , it was shown to decrease TER significantly [ 89 ] and may contribute to epithelial barrier disruption induced by Hp ( Figure 3E ) . This effect was confirmed in several types of polarized epithelial cells including EPH4 , T84 and MDCK and during infection . The latter effect was independent of VacA’s vacuolating activity as it was also seen with m2 - alleles of VacA [ 90 ] . It was proposed that selective permeabilization of polarized epithelial monolayers by VacA may lead to the release of certain molecules such as Ni 2 + , Fe 3 + , sugars and amino acids , which might support the growth of Hp within the gastric mucus [ 89 , 90 ] . As yet , the mechanism by which VacA alters paracellular permeability is little understood . However , it has also been noted that VacA increases the transepithelial flux of certain molecules such as urea the substrate of Hp urease [ 91 ] . The release of urea from cells , however , is attributed to the formation of VacA channels in the plasma membrane . Other studies have indicated that disruption of cell - to - cell junctions in polarized MDCK cells required VacA but also a second factor , injected CagA ( Figure 3E ) , which targets both tight and adherens junctions [ 20 , 92 ] . In contrast , it was shown that incubation of polarized T84 epithelia by VacA prepared from broth culture filtrate of Hp did not modify the TER of the epithelia [ 93 ] . More complexity arises from another recent study showing that Hp induced a progressive loss of barrier function in INS - GAS mice and MKN - 28 gastric epithelial cells , which was attenuated by inactivation of the Δ ureB gene , but not Δ vacA or Δ T4SS genes [ 94 ] . Remarkably , Hp induced the deregulation of specific tight junction proteins , including phosphorylation of MLC ( myosin regulatory light chain ) by MLC kinase and internalization of occludin . Thus , epithelial barrier disruption by Hp is a highly complex scenario , requiring various bacterial factors and signalling pathways which still need to be investigated in more detailed future studies [ 95 ] . Toxins 2010 , 2 78 Figure 3 . Model of the various activities of VacA to induce altered host cell signalling in epithelial and immune cells which contributes to persitent Hp colonization in the human stomach . Toxins 2010 , 2 79 8 . VacA Elicits Suppressive Activities on Immune Cell Proliferation During the long co - evolution of Hp with humans , the bacteria have accumulated numerous strategies to circumvent host immune cell functions . Some of these functions have been attributed to VacA ( Figure 3J - L ) . A pioneering early study demonstrated that VacA can inhibit processing and presentation of antigenic peptides to human CD4 - positive T cells ( Figure 3J ) , and suggested for the first time that VacA may contribute to the persistence of Hp by interfering with protective immune responses [ 96 ] . In infected professional phagocytes , such as mouse RAW 264 . 7 and human THP - 1 macrophage - like cell lines , wild - type Hp exhibited enhanced survival as compared to vacA deficient mutants [ 97 ] . Therefore , it appears that VacA can arrest phagosome maturation by recruiting and retaining coronin - 1 or TACO , the tryptophane aspartate - containing coat protein ( Figure 3K ) . In addition , it was shown that VacA can inhibit the expression of endothelial nitric oxygen synthase ( eNOS ) which resulted in significantly less production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in monocyte / macrophage - like U937 cells and enhanced survival of VacA - positive Hp ( Figure 3J ) . The detected pathway involved a suppressive effect of VacA on the expression of ILK ( integrin - linked kinase ) , which provided a direct link to eNOS downsteam of ILK [ 98 ] . However , enhanced survival of isogenic Δ vacA mutants as compared to their wild - type strains was not seen in two other reports when freshly isolated human monocytes were infected [ 99 , 100 ] . The latter differences may be attributed to varying infection doses , cell types or Hp strains carrying different vacA alleles . Co - incubation of purified VacA with or infection of T lymphocytes yields multiple effects . For example , VacA can specifically block the antigen - dependent proliferation of Jurkat T cells by interfering with IL - 2 - mediated signalling [ 101 , 102 ] . As discussed above , Hp targets CD18 ( β 2 integrin ) as the receptor of VacA on human T lymphocytes [ 62 ] . After entry , VacA inhibits Ca 2 + mobilization and , subsequently , downregulation of the activity of the Ca 2 + - dependent phosphatase calcineurin . This in turn inhibits the activation of transcription factor NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) . As a consequence , NFAT target genes such as IL - 2 and the high - affinity IL - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R - alpha ) are not expressed anymore ( Figure 3L ) . VacA , however , exerts a different effect on primary human CD4 - positive T cells , whose proliferation is inhibited through the T cell receptor ( CD28 ) and eventually by other VacA activities [ 103 ] . In the latter study , VacA was shown to suppress IL - 2 - induced cell cycle progression and proliferation of primary T cells without affecting NFAT . Therefore , VacA may inhibit the clonal expansion of T cells that have been activated by numerous bacterial antigens . This in turn would allow Hp to evade adaptive immune responses which can permit persistent infection . 9 . VacA - Dependent Pro - Inflammatory Signalling Activities Numerous Hp factors have been implicated in the induction of gastric inflammation . Besides peptidoglycan [ 14 ] , OipA [ 13 ] and CagA [ 21 ] , VacA has now also been found to activate pro - inflammatory responses during infection with Hp . For example , addition of VacA to the gastric adenocarcinoma cell line AZ - 521 activates two classes of MAP kinases ( p38 and Erk - 1 / 2 ) and the activating transcription factor 2 ( ATF - 2 ) signalling pathway [ 104 , Figure 3B ] . Pharmacological inhibition of p38 kinase activity , however , did not block the vacuolation phenotype or mitochondrial damage , which indicates that VacA - induced activation of the p38 / ATF - 2 signalling cascade is Toxins 2010 , 2 80 independent of endosomal and mitochondrial pathways of VacA [ 104 ] . VacA has also been reported to induce activation of p38 in several other types of cells [ 102 ] and U937 macrophage - like cells [ 105 ] . In the latter study , VacA - induced p38 activation in U937 cells revealed a prominent role in stimulation IL - 8 production via ATF - 2 , cAMP response element binding ( CREB ) protein and nuclear transcription factor kappa B ( NF - κ B ) . Interestingly , VacA can also induce NF - κ B in T cells [ 106 ] , thus the toxin obviously has two paradoxical activities on T cells , immunosuppression and pro - inflammatory effects ( Figure 3J ) . In addition , in neutrophils and macrophages , VacA treatment can stimulate the expression of Cox - 2 ( cyclooxygenase - 2 ) , a pro - inflammatory enzyme [ 102 ] . The expression of Cox - 2 is mediated by VacA - induction of p38 and also enhanced the secretion of prostaglandin E2 [ 105 ] . In another cell culture model , binding of VacA to RBL - 2H3 mast cells resulted in a rapid change in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations [ 107 ] . This was accompanied by stimulation of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( including IL - 6 and TNF - α ) , resulting in chemotaxis and degranulation of these mast cells [ 107 , 108 ] . 10 . Molecular Crosstalk between VacA and CagA Signalling Pathways Several recent studies have demonstrated that VacA does not act independently of other bacterial colonization or virulence factors . There are four prime examples of molecular crosstalk between VacA , CagA and the T4SS affecting multiple responses including Hp - induced apoptosis , cell vacuolation , cell elongation , NFAT signalling and EGFR activation , which will be discussed below . 10 . 1 . Role of VacA and CagA in Apoptotic and Anti - Apoptotic Signalling As described above VacA can target mitochondria and induce apoptotic cell death in vitro . However , for gastric cell apoptosis in vivo , several other parameters are likely to be important . Under normal conditions , rapid self - renewal of the gut epithelium , which occurs by a balance of progenitor proliferation and pit cell apoptosis , serves as a host defence mechanism to limit bacterial colonization . In the Mongolian gerbil ( Meriones unguiculatus ) model system , it was shown that Hp inhibits the apoptotic loss of pit cells [ 22 ] . Suppression of apoptosis contributed to pit hyperplasia and persistent bacterial colonization of the stomach , and this was mediated by injected CagA which stimulated the pro - survival mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase member Erk - 1 / 2 and anti - apoptotic protein MCL - 1 in the gastric pits . Thus , it appears that CagA counteracts VacA signalling and activates anti - apoptotic and host cell survival signal cascades to overcome self - renewal of the gastric epithelium and contribute to chronic Hp infection [ 22 ] . In a very recent study , the transfected carboxy - terminal domain of CagA ( 38 kDa ) inhibited VacA - induced apoptosis by two complementary mechanisms [ 109 ] . Tyrosine - phosphorylated CagA prevented pinocytosed VacA to reach its target intracellular compartments . Unphosphorylated CagA triggered an anti - apoptotic activity blocking VacA - induced apoptosis at the mitochondrial level without affecting the intracellular trafficking of the toxin . These results were confirmed during infection with Hp and it was proposed that , once bacteria have colonized the gastric niche , the apoptotic action of VacA might be detrimental for the survival of Hp adherent to the mucosa . Thus , CagA association with VacA maybe a novel , highly ingenious microbial strategy to locally protect its ecological niche against a bacterial virulence factor , with however detrimental consequences for the human host [ 109 ] . Toxins 2010 , 2 81 10 . 2 . Role of VacA and CagA in NFAT Signalling It has been demonstrated that CagA and VacA have opposing effects in T cells , for example on the activation of transcription factor NFAT [ 110 ] . A genome - wide screening of CagA - responsive genes using DNA microarrays identified NFAT transcription factors whose binding sites were overrepresented in the promoter regions of CagA - activated genes . The results of reporter assays confirmed that CagA was capable of activating NFAT in a manner independent of CagA phosphorylation . Expression of CagA in gastric epithelial cells provoked translocation of NFATc3 , a member of the NFAT family , from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and activated an NFAT - regulated gene , p21WAF1 / Cip1 . CagA - mediated NFAT activation was abolished by inhibiting calcineurin or phospholipase C - gamma activity . Furthermore , treatment of gastric epithelial cells with purified VacA , which inhibits NFAT activity in T lymphocytes [ 101 ] , counteracted the ability of CagA to activate NFAT [ 110 ] . These findings indicate that the two major Hp virulence factors inversely control NFAT activity . Considering the pleiotropic roles of NFAT in cell growth and differentiation , deregulation of NFAT , either positively or negatively , depending on the relative exposure of cells to CagA and VacA , may contribute to the various disease outcomes caused by Hp infection . 10 . 3 . Role of VacA and CagA in the Vacuolation and Cell Elongation Phenotypes It has been demonstrated in vitro that VacA can negatively regulate the CagA - induced elongation phenotype , and CagA can downregulate VacA - induced cell vacuolation [ 111 , 112 ] . In particular , isogenic Δ cagA and T4SS - deficient Hp mutants were found to significantly increase VacA - induced vacuolation of AGS gastric epithelial cells , and the Δ vacA mutants significantly increased the CagA - induced cellular elongation phenotype as compared with their wild - type strains . Although AGS cells incubated with the wild - type Hp strains may display both vacuolation and elongation phenotype formation , it was found that ( i ) the length of elongated cells was significantly reduced in vacuolated cells compared with those without vacuolation ; ( ii ) the number of vacuoles was significantly reduced in elongated cells ; and ( iii ) cells displaying extensive vacuolation did not subsequently elongate and vice versa . Importantly , VacA did not affect the phosphorylation of CagA [ 111 , 112 ] . These data indicate that VacA and CagA can downregulate each other ' s phenotypical effects on AGS epithelial cells . 10 . 4 . Role of VacA and T4SS in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Signalling Another recent study indicated that the T4SS and VacA have opposing effects on the activation of members of the EGFR family kinases during infection with Hp [ 112 ] . Early studies have demonstrated that Hp can activate EGFR in a T4SS - dependent manner [ 24 , 25 ] , and that addition of purified VacA or VacA - positive culture supernatants had suppressive effects on proliferation , migration or wound healing of gastric epithelial cells in vitro [ 113 – 116 ] . In the latter studies it was shown that VacA can block the activity of externally added EGF . These findings suggest that VacA may interfere with EGFR receptor signalling and cell proliferation ( Figure 3G , H ) . Indeed , preparations of VacA or infection with VacA - expressing Hp exhibited suppressive effects on the phosphorylation and consequently activation of EGFR [ 112 , 114 ] and HER2 / Neu , another member of the EGFR family Toxins 2010 , 2 82 [ 112 ] . Immunofluorescence data showed internalized EGFR in infections with VacA - expressing Hp , providing a possible mechanism for how significant portions of EGFR are inactivated by VacA [ 112 ] . Interestingly , RPTP - alpha but not vacuolation per se played a role in this process . In addition , it was shown that EGFR - mediated Erk - 1 / 2 activation is necessary for the CagA - induced elongation phenotype ( Figure 3I ) , which can be suppressed in infection with Hp strains expressing highly active VacA [ 112 ] . Although further investigation is necessary , these data clearly demonstrate that VacA can downregulate CagA ' s effects on epithelial cells , a novel molecular mechanism showing how Hp may avoid excessive cellular damage during infection , which may also contribute to ensure persistent infection . 11 . Other VacA - Dependent Signalling Activities In addition to the VacA - triggered activities described above , several other features have been described . For example , Yeast two - hybrid ( Y2H ) screens and other experiments have demonstrated VacA’s potential for specific binding to the receptor for activated C kinase - 1 , Rack - 1 ( Table 1 ) , however , its function for the infection process is widely unknown [ 69 ] . The effect of the toxin on endosomal and lysosomal functions was also studied by following procathepsin - D maturation and EGF degradation in HeLa cells exposed to VacA . Interestingly , VacA blocked cleavage of procathepsin - D ( 53 kDa ) into both the intermediate ( 47 kDa ) and the mature ( 31 kDa ) form , and intracellular degradation of EGF was also inhibited [ 117 ] . These findings suggest that VacA can also impair the degradative power of late endosomes and lysosomes . Finally , further complexity in the overall scenario arises from the observation that VacA can also activate the beta - catenin signalling pathway [ 118 ] . Incubation of AZ - 521 cells with VacA resulted in phosphorylation of protein kinase B ( Akt ) and glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta ( GSK3beta ) through a phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) - dependent pathway . Following phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3beta , beta - catenin was released from a GSK3beta / beta - catenin complex , with subsequent nuclear translocation . Inhibitor studies indicated that VacA - induced phosphorylation of Akt does not require VacA internalization and is independent of vacuolation . In contrast , infection with a Δ vacA mutant failed to induce phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta , or release of beta - catenin from a GSK3beta / beta - catenin complex [ 118 ] . These results support the hypothesis that VacA activates the PI3K → Akt signalling pathway , resulting in phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3beta . Subsequent translocation of beta - catenin into the host cell nucleus is consistent with effects of VacA on beta - catenin - regulated transcriptional activity and a new possible role in the pathogenesis of Hp , including the development of gastric cancer . Thus , VacA is a highly fascinating bacterial toxin with multiple signalling activities . 12 . Conclusions Hp is the most common chronic bacterial infection worldwide , and , although asymptomatic in the majority of infected persons , it is also the cause of significant rates of morbidity and mortality . The interest in this field is underlined by more than 28 , 000 scientific publications that have appeared in PubMed since its discovery in 1982 . However , Hp infection occurs in approximately half of the world population , with disease being an exception rather than the rule . Understanding how this organism interacts with its host is essential for formulating an effective strategy to deal with its most important Toxins 2010 , 2 83 clinical consequences . Studies of host - bacterial interactions and bacterial virulence factors in this infection model have provided important insights for clinical practice . Research over the past decade on VacA , CagA and the T4SS has provided us with fundamental insights into Hp biology and has generated a complex and often puzzling scenario . VacA is secreted into the extracellular space and also is , at least in part , retained on the bacterial cell surface . The toxin exists in monomeric and oligomeric forms , and binds to multiple host cell surface receptors . We have discussed here the cellular effects induced by VacA which include pore formation in the plasma membrane , alteration of endo - lysosomal function , vacuolation , apoptosis and immune cell inhibition . VacA has been demonstrated to target several different cell components , including endocytic vesicles , the actin - cytoskeleton and mitochondria . However , it still remains unclear whether VacA has an enzymatic activity , and if it should be categorised as an A / B - type toxin , a pore - forming toxin or both . In addition , it appears that there is substantial molecular crosstalk between VacA and CagA signalling cascades during infection both in epithelial and immune cells . These novel findings further highlight the enormous complexity in Hp - host cell interactions . Thus , it appears that Hp ‘s virulence factors will continue to be a fascinating and rewarding research subject in future studies .
