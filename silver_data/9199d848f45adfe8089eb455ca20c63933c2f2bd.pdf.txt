Smith , October 27 , 1989 ABSTRACT We have developed a method for rapidly finding patterns of conserved amino acid residues ( motifs ) in groups of functionally related proteins . AU 3 - amino acid pat - terns in a group ofproteins ofthe type aal dl aa2 d2 aa3 , where dl and d2 are distances that can be varied in a range up to 24 residues , are accumulated into an array . Segments of the proteins containing those patterns that occur most frequently are aligned on each other by a scoring method that obtains an average relatedness value for all the amino acids in each column of the aligned sequence block based on the Dayhoff relatedness odds matrix . The automated method successfully finds and displays nearly all of the sequence motifs that have been previously reported to occur in 33 reverse transcriptases , 18 DNA integrases , and 30 DNA methyltransferases . With the growth of the protein sequence data base in recent years , there have been a number of attempts to identify patterns of conserved amino acid residues in functionally related groups of proteins ( 1 - 11 ) . Such sequence motifs can be found in some cases by single inspection , but more commonly they are found by examination of conserved residues in aligned groups of proteins . There are excellent computer programs for sequence alignment of two homolo - gous proteins ( 12 - 14 ) , but only recently have automated procedures for multiple sequence alignment been described ( 7 , 15 , 16 ) . These generally utilize consecutive pairwise alignments , proceeding from the most homologous pair to the least . Lipman et al . ( 15 ) have implemented an algorithm capable of aligning up to eight sequences . While alignment methods are useful for discovering sequence motifs , they still require considerable effort when applied to large groups of proteins and they have the disadvantage that they cannot be applied to proteins bearing little homology . We have developed an alternative method for identifying sequence motifs that depends on locating 3 - amino acid pat - terns common to a majority of the sequences in a group . Our method works best on large groups of proteins ( > 10 ) and does not depend on the presence of global homologies . Thus its range of applicability is complementary to that of the align - ment methods , which are most successful when applied to small numbers of homologous proteins . METHODS Definitions . For purposes of this work we define the following terms ( refer to Fig . 1 for examples ) . A pattern is any arrangement of two or more amino acids occurring in a protein . For example , A . . . Q . H . A . is a 4 - amino acid pattern in which the dots represent unspecified amino acids . A motif is a pattern that occurs frequently within a group of proteins . A motif is stringent if it occurs exactly in every member of a particular group of proteins , otherwise it is degenerate .

A sample motif block containing aligned sequence seg - ments from 10 proteins . Blocks are solid ; that is , they contain no gaps . The pattern A . . . Q . . . . 1 , which occurs in all 10 sequences , is called a stringent motif , whereas the pattern A . . . Q . H . . I , which occurs in only 7 of the 10 sequences , is called a degenerate motif . Motifs , as we narrowly define them , are simply patterns that occur frequently in a group of proteins and they are always confined to solid blocks . Whether or not a given motif has functional significance , rather than being merely a chance occurrence , must be determined by experiment . stringent motif with respect to the subgroup of 7 but is degenerate with respect to the group of 10 . However , if the subpattern A . . . Q . . . . I occurs exactly in the group of 10 proteins , then the subpattern forms a stringent motif for the whole group . A block is a solid array of aligned sequence segments containing a motif . Each row of a block is a solid ( non - gapped ) segment of one of the sequences from the group . Motifs , as we define them , are confined to sequence blocks . When multiple blocks are found , the individual blocks are generally separated by variable sequence dis - tances from the other blocks . A Computer Program to Find Motifs . We have developed a program ( MOTIF ) in the C language that rapidly finds 3 - amino acid motifs in large groups of functionally related proteins . All 3 - amino acid patterns of the type aal dl aa2 d2 aa3 are accumulated into an array . The distances dl and d2 can vary from 0 to 24 residues . The maximum range of variation for dl and d2 is set at run time by means of a distance parameter . For example , if the distance range is set to 10 residues , the pattern array will contain 20 x 10 x 20 x 10 x 20 = 800 , 000 elements . Only one pass through each sequence is required to tally the patterns ; thus the time for the search is approximately proportional to the number of se - quences and to the square of the distance parameter . Those patterns that occur a significant number of times and thus qualify as motifs are screened for redundancies . Duplicate 3 - amino acid motifs , defined as motifs in which aal is at identical positions in the corresponding sequences of each motif , are screened out . These duplicates arise commonly . For example , a motif containing 5 amino acids will have six 3 - amino acid motifs that start with the first amino acid and three 3 - amino acid motifs that start with the second amino acid of the 5 - amino acid motif . The seven duplicates are eliminated . In addition , since the program examines a min - Abbreviation : cpu , central processing unit . 826 The publication costs ofthis article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

USA 87 ( 1990 ) 827 imum region of 30 residues surrounding each motif , only the highest - scoring motifs ( see below ) , separated by < 10 resi - dues from each other , are retained . These two screening procedures serve to reduce the sometimes large number of related 3 - amino acid motifs arising from a single larger motif . We have developed a method of scoring motifs that pro - vides a measure of the amount of surrounding homology and is useful for differentiating significant motifs from random background motifs ( see below ) . A block containing a cen - trally located motif is divided into columns . To measure the degree of conservative substitution in each column , we use the PAM - 250 scoring method developed by Dayhoff et al . ( 17 ) , which gives a numerical score to each pair of amino acid residues in proportion to their frequency of substitution for one another by mutation during evolution . The PAM - 250 scores of all pairs of residues in the column are totaled and averaged to form a mean column score . All positive mean column scores are then summed to form the motif block score . Motifs are displayed as a block , the top line of which summarizes the motif pattern by displaying a one - letter amino acid symbol whenever all residues in a column are identical , a star when the column score is . 2 , and a plus sign when the column score is 0 or 1 . At the end of the block the 50 % degenerate motif is displayed - i . e . , the symbols of all residues that occur in a column with > 50 % frequency are displayed . As an option , the positions of motifs may be displayed on linear maps of the sequences . MOTIF finds the best alignment of unmatched sequences not included in the block by sliding each unmatched sequence along the block , calculating a composite PAM - 250 score at each position relative to the block , and choosing the highest scoring alignment . The composite score is a sum of products of the mean column score times the sliding sequence column scores . The latter are obtained by summing the PAM - 250 scores of all pairs formed by a sliding sequence residue and a column residue from the block . Only positive column scores are used in the alignment score calculation . This rewards good residue fits and ignores poor fits . Matched sequences are also individually realigned against the block to select the best of two or more repeated patterns occurring in the same sequence and also to determine whether the original 3 - amino acid match is the best match to the block overall . Several parameters may be empirically set prior to com - pilation of the program . Currently the program uses the following default settings : the maximum number of se - quences is 50 , the maximum sequence length is 1000 , the maximum distance between two residues in the 3 - amino acid pattern is 24 , the minimum and maximum block widths are 30 and 55 , and the maximum total motifs and relevant motifs ( after screening ) are 100 and 50 , respectively . The number of matches selected as significant ( s ) for classifying a pattern as a motif is set during run time , as are the number of allowed internal pattern repeats ( r ) and the maximum value of the distance parameters dl and d2 ( d ) . A shorthand notation , [ s , r , d ] , is used in the Results to indicate the parameter settings . SoQurce code was compiled with Turbo C 2 . 0 ( Borland ) . Computation ( central processing unit , cpu ) times were determined on a 12 - MHz PC / AT - compatible ( SIVA 286 ) computer without a math coprocessor . Sequences . The DNA methylase sequences were obtained from G . Wilson ( New England BioLabs ) . The DNA integrase sequences were supplied by R . Weisberg ( National Institutes of Health ) with the exception of HPintl , which was obtained from J . Scocca ( The Johns Hopkins University ) . The reverse transcriptase sequences were from R . F . Doolittle ( Univer - sity of California , San Diego ) . RESULTS Estimating the Random Motif Background . Our procedure searches for multiple occurrences of 3 - amino acid patterns in a group of protein sequences . It is essential to know when a given multiple occurrence is statistically significant . A pre - cise calculation of the expected frequency of random multiple occurrences of patterns in a given group of sequences is difficult ; hence we will make some simplifying assumptions to obtain an estimate of the probability of such occurrences . Consider n random sequences each of length I and with total length L = n * l . Consider a single specific 3 - amino acid pattern with the approximate mean occurrence of m = L * P . , * P . - P , 3 , where the P values are the probabilities of each of the amino acids in the pattern . The probability of exactly x occurrences of this pattern in the total length L is the Poisson distribution term P = ( mxeJa ) / x ! . The probability of < x occurrences is M 2 ~ m ( x 1 ) P < x = e - m 1 + m + 2 ! + x - ) 3 ] and the probability of 2x occurrences is P : X = 1 - P < x . But there are dl * d2 - 8000 3 - amino acid patterns . Therefore , the probability of 2x occurrences of at least one of the patterns is approximately P = dl * d2 * 8000 * PxS , where the approximation is good only if P < < 1 and all the amino acids are of equal frequency . Curve A in Fig . 2 shows the plot of the 50 % expectation of 2x occurrences of at least one of the 800 , 000 3 - amino acid patterns as a function of n assuming dl and d2 each inde - pendently range between 0 and 9 and all amino acids are of equal ( 0 . 05 ) probability . It can be seen that the background of chance multiple occurrences is quite significant relative to the number of sequences ( n ) when n is < 10 , but as n increases , the background becomes less significant relative to n . For example , when n = 10 , there is a 50 % chance of at least one pattern occurring 7 or more times , while with n = 30 the background level is 12 . In real sequences , 3 - amino acid patterns containing the most common amino acids will have the greatest mean occurrences and will account for most of 3028 26 - m , 24 22 O . 20 - 18 - U _ 16 - o 14 12 .

The sequences are all 400 residues in length and the distance parameter is 10 . In curve A the 20 different amino acids occur with equal frequency . In curve B , only the 2700 patterns composed of 3 amino acids with probabilities of occurrence of 0 . 08 are considered . For example , in curve B , 30 random sequences of400 amino acids would have a 50o expectation of having at least one of the 2700 patterns matched 17 times . Biochemistry : Smith et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 87 ( 1990 ) the background . Curve B in Fig . 2 shows the level of background expected for just the 2700 patterns containing three particular amino acids with probabilities of 0 . 08 each . Clearly the background of chance multiple occurrences of such patterns is very significant . An important feature of our program is its ability to filter out these random background motifs . By using relatively high significance levels , only patterns that occur at a frequency well above the random background level are obtained . In addition , random motifs are removed by setting the internal repeat parameter to 0 or to a low value . Random motif patterns tend to be repeated in one or more sequences , whereas real motif patterns tend to occur singly in each sequence of a group . Additional methods for distinguishing real from random motifs are covered in the Discussion . Sequence Motifs in DNA Methyltransferases . Fifteen DNA - adenine methylase sequences were analyzed for sequence motifs . With the run time parameters set at [ 13 , 1 , 5 ] , a single stringent motif , PPY ( score 37 ) , is identified and the corre - sponding 50 % degenerate motif is D . . Y . DPPY ( Fig . 3 ) . The same motif is repeatedly identified using distance parameters ranging from 1 to 24 ; however , computation time increases from about 2 sec to 214 sec over this range ( see Methods for computer used ) , varying approximately as the square of the distance allowed between the 3 amino acids during the pattern search . With repeat and distance parameters fixed at 1 and 5 , the same motif continues to be found as the significance factor is lowered . At settings of [ 9 , 1 , 5 ] the additional pattern F . G . G ( score 29 ) appears , along with several apparently spurious motifs with scores generally < 20 and consisting of the most common amino acids . With repeats set to 0 , no motifs are detected until a setting of [ 9 , 0 , 5 ] , when F . G . G and one apparently spurious motif ( score 17 ) appear . A routine is included in the program to randomly shuffle each sequence so that the background level of motifs can be measured empirically . With [ 9 , 0 , 5 ] parameter settings , no motifs are found after shuffling .

With [ 9 , 1 , 5 ] settings , motifs range from three to six in number on independent shuffles . These motifs have scores < 20 and contain the most common amino acids . The empirically determined level of background is close to that which we estimate from theoretical considerations ( see Fig . 2 ) . Fourteen 5 - methylcytosine methylases were examined . At parameter settings of [ 12 , 0 , 5 ] , five motifs are found . These correspond to the five major motifs I , IV , VI , VIII , and X identified by Posfai et al . ( 7 ) . At settings of [ 10 , 0 , 5 ] , the additional minor motifs V , VII , and IX identified by those authors are found . No additional motifs are found at settings of [ 9 , 0 , 5 ] or at any other settings of the internal repeat or distance parameters . After the sequences are shuffled , no motifs are found at [ 9 , 0 , 5 ] , one is found at [ 8 , 0 , 5 ] , and 12 or 13 at [ 7 , 0 , 5 ] . The N4 - methylcytosine methylase M . Pvu 11 ( 18 ) was ex - amined against either the fifteen adenine methylases or the fourteen 5 - methylcytosine enzymes . With the 5 - methylcy - tosine group , it showed high - scoring matches only to F . G . G . However , with the adenine methylase group , it scored well against both this motif and the DPPY motif . The 30 pooled methylases were examined as a group . A single motif , F . G . G , is found in 23 proteins when the settings [ 23 , 1 , 5 ] are used . The 50 % degenerate motif is LF . G . G .

MOTIF parameter settings were [ 15 , 0 , 24 ] and the cpu time was 214 sec . appear . Shuffled sequences begin to produce a random motif background at a setting of [ 14 , 1 , 5 ] . A Sequence Motif in the DNA Integrases . Eighteen DNA integrases were examined . A single large motif spanning at least 36 residues is found in 15 of the proteins ( Fig . 5 ) . Partial alignments are found in the other 3 proteins . Four ofthe most highly conserved residues in the motif are histidine , arginine , glycine , and tyrosine , separated by distances dl = 2 , d2 = 21 , and d3 = 9 . Two of the sequences , intlam and hkint , are misaligned in the main block . The correct alignments of these two sequences , found by setting the significance parameter lower to pick up various submotifs of the larger motif , place the histidine residue at position 309 in each sequence . The misalignment is due to a single residue deletion that reduces d2 to 20 . This separates one part of the pattern from the other . It just happens that an optimal fit to the first halfofthe pattern occurs in the amino - terminal portion of these two proteins . In addition , the sequence tpna554 has d3 = 10 but is still correctly aligned . Since no allowance is made for gaps in the current version of the program , sequences will sometimes be misaligned . The greatest utility of the program is in discov - ering motifs , not in correctly aligning every sequence . Some sequences will contain degenerate versions of the motif or gaps that will lower the alignment score sufficiently that incorrect patterns are chosen . Sequence Motifs in Reverse Transcriptases . Thirty - three reverse transcriptases were analyzed . Three motifs were found at a setting of [ 21 , 2 , 5 ] . Y . DD ( score 31 ) occurs in 28 of the proteins and the 50 % degenerate motif is Y . DDIL ( Fig . 6 ) . The motif PQG ( score 27 ) is found in 23 sequences and the 50 % degenerate motif is P . . RY . W . VLPQG . K . SP . . FQ L . The motif R . . . D . . . . . N ( score 35 ) is found in 20 proteins and the 50 % degenerate motifis KK . . GKWR . L . DLR . . N . . T PG . These motifs are found in the same relative order in all the sequences in which they occur . DISCUSSION The discovery that eukaryotic genes are in pieces that are spliced together at the mRNA level ( 19 ) led to the proposal that the gene pieces ( exons ) correspond to functional do - mains and that new protein genes evolve by recombining functional pieces from other genes ( 20 ) . If , in evolution , a particular exon were to be incorporated into a group of proteins , those proteins might over time conserve certain amino acids specific or crucial to a particular function carried by the exon , whereas other amino acids within the exon that were of lesser importance might undergo extensive mutation . As a consequence , any homologies would be obliterated except those retained at the few crucial positions . The conserved residues would constitute a sequence motif com - mon to the group of proteins and correlated to the particular function . With these ideas in mind , we and others have sought a means to compare large , functionally related groups of proteins for highly conserved residue patterns . As test cases for our program , we assembled several large groups of related proteins in which conserved amino acid motifs had been identified . The DNA methylases found in restriction and modification systems have been extensively compared ( 7 - 11 ) . Our program readily finds the DPPY motif common to the adenine methylases and it finds eight of the cytosine methylase motifs reported by Posfai et al . ( 7 ) . Two additional motifs reported by these authors are too degener - ate for our program to find . By comparing all of the meth - ylases , including one N4 - cytosine methylase , we find the motif F . G . G in 23 out of 30 sequences , and there are partial fits in most of the remaining sequences . The complete 50 % degenerate motif is LF . G . G . . . . . . . . . G . We speculate that the F . G . G motif might be part of the binding domain for S - adenosylmethionine , the common methyl donor for all these methylases . The F . G . G motif has also been reported by Lauster ( 21 ) . In addition , we readily find the major motifs reported by others for the integrases ( 4 ) and the reverse transcriptases ( 6 ) . Global homologies are present in some of the large groups - for example , in the reverse transcriptases and the cytosine methylases . Our program rapidly locates and aligns segments of each sequence with respect to common motifs . The blocks ofaligned segments can serve as anchor points for further alignment as has been pointed out by Posfai et al . ( 7 ) . Optimal multisequence alignment should be possible in these interblock regions by using algorithms of the type developed by Lipman et al . ( 15 ) and Posfai et al . ( 7 ) . Thus our approach in combination with these methods might lead to an efficient , relatively fast program for global alignment of > 10 se - quences . Biochemistry : Smith et al . Proc . Natl . Acad .

Y . DDIL . . . Most common amino acids FIG . 6 . The most significant sequence motif among 33 reverse transcriptases is Y . DD . See legend to Fig . 3 for explanation of the columns of numbers . The first unmatched sequence ( below dotted line ) has a second - best alignment of FADD at position 173 ; the second and third unmatched sequences have LADD ( 173 ) and FADD ( 160 ) , but they score less than second - best . A shortcoming of our program is its inability to deal with gaps . Clearly not all residue spacings in a motif will be rigidly conserved . The integrases provide an example in which at least three of the sequences have single - residue deletions or additions within the motif . One sequence is still correctly aligned , the other two are not . However , alignment is correct in several of the submotifs of the larger motif , and by inspection of these we are able to find the correct alignments . Our program will successfully find motifs if the number of sequences is large and if only a few sequences have gaps located in the motif . MOTIF will fail if gapping is extensive or if the motif is very degenerate . We currently do not see a way to allow for gaps without significantly increasing background and computation time . In designing MOTIF , we found that 2 - amino acid patterns gave too high a random background of matches and 3 - amino acid patterns gave a satisfactory background , whereas 4 - amino acid patterns , while decreasing the background , put too much constraint on the type of motif found . Although the background of random motifs is fairly significant with 3 - amino acid patterns ( see Fig . 2 and Results ) , we have satisfactorily dealt with this in two ways . First , we have incorporated a parameter that sets a limit on the number of allowed internal repetitions of the pattern . Real motifs tend to occur singly in each sequence , whereas background motifs are dispersed randomly over the total sequence length ; consequently they are normally present in more than one copy in some sequences while being absent from others . However , in using MOTIF it is not wise to always set the repeat parameter to zero . Some proteins have internal du - plications ( e . g . , M . Fok I in the adenine methylase group ) , and there is also chance ofoccasional random internal repetitions of a real motif pattern . Second , we have incorporated a sequence - shuffling procedure to permit the random back - ground of spurious motifs to be empirically determined for any group of sequences . Thus when a motif is found , it can be presumed to be real if no spurious motifs are found after shuffling using the same parameter settings . Spurious motifs , which generally occur at low significance parameter settings , can in most cases be identified by their low total scores and by their amino acid content . The low score derives from the minimal level of surrounding homol - ogy . Amino acid content is also a useful discriminator . Real motifs often contain the less common amino acids , while spurious motifs contain the most common ones . By applying the shuffling routine to a few sequence groups , it quickly becomes evident that background motifs consist largely of the most common amino acids . MOTIF displays the frequen - cies of each of the amino acids in the protein group to aid in identifying the common amino acids . With these character - istics in mind , it is generally possible to differentiate between real and spurious motifs . We believe that MOTIF will prove most useful in discovering motifs in large groups of poorly conserved sequences that are not amenable to analysis by current multisequence alignment procedures .
