End User Software Engineering : CHI’2008 Special Interest Group Meeting Abstract End users create software whenever they write , for instance , educational simulations , spreadsheets , or dynamic e - business web applications . Researchers are working to bring the benefits of rigorous soft - ware engineering methodologies to these end users to try to make their software more reliable . Unfor - tunately , errors are pervasive in end - user software , and the resulting impact is sometimes enormous . This special interest group meeting has two pur - poses : to incorporate attendees’ ideas and feedback into an emerging survey of the state of this inter - esting new sub - area , and generally to bring to - gether the community of researchers who are ad - dressing this topic , with the companies that are creating end - user programming tools .

Introduction One way to define “programming” is as the process of transforming a mental plan of desired actions for a computer into a representation that can be understood by the computer [ 9 ] . Expressed this way , it seems ob - vious that the study of humans and programming should be a topic of HCI . Indeed , this area of study has a long history , and has appeared under many names , including “Software Psychology” [ 21 ] , “Psychology of Programming” [ 6 , 8 ] and “Empirical Studies of Pro - gramming” ( ESP ) . We define “end - user programmers” ( EUP ) as people who write programs , but not as their primary job func - tion — they write programs in support of achieving their main goal , which is something else , such as ac - counting , designing a web page , doing office work , sci - entific research , entertainment , etc . End - user pro - grammers generally use special - purpose languages such as spreadsheet languages or web authoring scripts , but some EUPs , such as chemists or other sci - entists , may learn to use “regular” programming lan - guages such as C or Java to achieve their programming goals . Two NSF workshops determined that end - user software is in need of serious attention [ 3 ] . The reasons are compelling . Our research shows that while there are about 3 million professional programmers in the United States , over 12 million people say they do program - ming at work , and over 12 million people use spread - sheets and databases , and thus may also be considered to be doing programming [ 20 ] ( see Figure 1 ) . The NSF reports that there are about 6 million scientists and engineers in the US , most of whom program as part of their jobs [ 16 ] . Unfortunately , however , errors are per - vasive in software created by end users . When the software that end users create is not dependable , there can be serious consequences for the people whose re - tirement funds , credit histories , e - business revenues , and even health and safety rely on decisions made based on that software . For example , a Texas oil firm lost millions of dollars in an acquisition deal through spreadsheet errors [ 19 ] . Two recent large collaborative efforts , one in the U . S . ( the EUSES Consortium http : / / eusesconsortium . org / ) , and one in Europe ( the Network of Excellence on End - User Development , http : / / giove . cnuce . cnr . it / eud - net . htm ) have produced a number of promising results in this area ( see , e . g . , [ 24 ] ) . Special Interest Group meetings at CHI’2004 [ 13 ] , CHI’2005 [ 14 ] , and CHI’2007 [ 15 ] , and the WEUSE series of workshops at ICSE’2005 [ 7 ] , CHI’2006 [ 5 ] , and upcoming at ICSE’2008 , very successfully brought together re - searchers and companies interested in this topic . In addition , a Dagstuhl meeting was held in February , 2007 , at which about 50 researchers in the areas of HCI , programming languages , and software engineering spent a week studying the state of the art in this area ( see www . dagstuhl . de / 07081 ) . The special interest group ( SIG ) meeting at CHI’08 is designed to bring this community back together , as well as to introduce the area to others who are inter - ested in allowing users to create more correct software . The meeting will solicit attendees’ inputs and feedback on an emerging survey that aims to capture the current state of this active new sub - area . We especially want to involve practitioners interested in current and future techniques that can be embodied in tools and develop - ment processes . Examples of Current Work A few End - User Software Engineering ( EUSE ) projects , some of which have been presented at CHI , are already successful . Here are just a few examples . The “Natural Programming” project at Carnegie Mellon University has been working for more than 10 years to make programming more “natural” , or closer to the way people think . Many studies were performed ( e . g . , [ 11 , 12 , 17 ] ) , and new programming languages [ 18 ] and environments were created . For example , Figure 2 shows a new technique for debugging which lets users ask about program output [ 10 ] . The “End - User Software Engineering” project at Oregon State University aims to improve the reliability of soft - ware produced by end - user programmers in general , and by spreadsheet users in particular . Some results have included “What You See Is What You Test” ( WYSIWYT ) integrated with fault localization ( Figure 3 ) [ 4 ] , semi - automated detection of erroneous combina - tions of units in spreadsheets ( Figure 4 ) [ 1 ] , and new methods for involving end users in the “debugging” of machine - learned programs [ 22 ] . The work emphasizes research on how to engage users in end - user software engineering practices without detrimentally interrupting their problem - solving efforts . The Gender HCI Project [ 2 ] , a collaboration of Oregon State University and Drexel University , has the goal to support both males’ and females’ problem solving , es - pecially in end - user software development tasks . Our results show that females are less willing than males to try out and adopt software features that support testing and dataflow - oriented debugging , and further that male and female end - user programmers use different strate - gies when debugging [ 23 ] .
