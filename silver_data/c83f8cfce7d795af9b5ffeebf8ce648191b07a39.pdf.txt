DOI 10 . 1002 / jor . 22178 ABSTRACT : Connexin43 ( Cx43 ) plays an important role in osteoblastic differentiation in vitro , and bone formation in vivo . Mice with osteoblast / osteocyte - speciﬁc loss of Cx43 display decreased gap junctional intercellular communication ( GJIC ) , bone density , and corti - cal thickness . To determine the role of Cx43 in fracture healing , a closed femur fracture was induced in Osteocalcin - Cre þ ; Cx43 ﬂox / ﬂox ( Cx43cKO ) and Cre - ; Cx43 ﬂox / ﬂox ( WT ) mice . We tested the hypothesis that loss of Cx43 results in decreased bone formation and impaired healing following fracture . Here , we show that osteoblast and osteocyte - speciﬁc deletion of Cx43 results in decreased bone formation , bone remodeling , and mechanical properties during fracture healing . Cx43cKO mice display decreased bone volume , total volume , and fewer TRAP þ osteoclasts . Furthermore , loss of Cx43 in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes results in a signiﬁcant decrease in torsional rigidity between 21 and 35 days post - fracture , compared to WT mice . These studies identify a novel role for the gap junction protein Cx43 during fracture healing , suggesting that loss of Cx43 can result in both decreased bone formation and bone resorption . Therefore , enhancing Cx43 expression or GJIC may provide a novel means to enhance bone formation during fracture healing . (cid:1) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society .

J Orthop Res Keywords : connexin 43 ; fracture healing ; mouse model ; bone formation ; bone remodeling Connexin 43 ( Cx43 ) is the most abundant gap junction protein in bone . 1 Cx43 has been shown to play many important roles in both bone formation and homeosta - sis including regulation of osteoblastic proliferation , 2 differentiation , 3 – 5 and survival . 6 In vitro work from our laboratory has shown that gap junction intercellu - lar communication ( GJIC ) is required between osteo - cytes and osteoblasts in order to transduce biophysical signals , such as ﬂuid ﬂow - induced shear stress , 7 – 9 while Cx43 also regulates the response to mechanical loading of bone in vivo . 10 , 11 Additionally , general up - regulation of Cx43 has been observed during fracture healing in young and aged rats . 12 Connexin 43 is encoded by the Gja1 gene , and com - plete loss of Gja1 results in delayed mineralization of the skeleton and decreased osteoblastic differentiation in vitro . 4 Severe cardiac defects in Gja1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice result in death soon after birth , 13 and necessitate the use of conditional deletion constructs to study the postnatal role of Cx43 in bone function including fracture healing . Mice with osteoblast / osteocyte - speciﬁc ( Osteo - calcin - Cre ) loss of Cx43 display decreased GJIC , bone density , cortical thickness , and load at failure 11 consistent with an osteopenic phenotype . Cx43 - deﬁcient mice also have an altered response to mechanical loading 10 , 11 and are less sensitive to the anabolic effects of PTH . 14 Fracture healing is divided in to four main over - lapping stages ; inﬂammation , bridging cartilaginous callus formation , mineralization of callus , and bone remodeling . 15 Cx43 is expressed in cartilage , 16 – 18 and is required for mineralization , 4 and osteoclastogene - sis , 19 suggesting that Cx43 may play a vital role in multiple stages of fracture healing . Furthermore , Cx43 is required for the anabolic effects of parathyroid hor - mone ( PTH ) , 14 which can enhance fracture healing . 20 The purpose of this study was to examine the role of Cx43 in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes during frac - ture healing , and test the hypothesis that loss of Cx43 results in impaired fracture healing due to decreased osteoblast differentiation and bone formation . Identiﬁ - cation of the role of Cx43 in fracture healing may iden - tify a novel clinical target to improve fracture healing . METHODS Mice All animal procedures were approved by the Penn State College of Medicine IACUC . Cx43 conditional knockout mice were generated by crossing Osteocalcin - Cre mice ( provided by Dr . Tom Clemens ) 21 with Cx43 ﬂox / ﬂox mice ( provided by Dr . Roberto Civitelli ) . 22 This cross resulted in loss of Cx43 expression in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes . 11 Fracture Healing Model A closed femur fracture was induced in 10 - week - old female WT and Cx43cKO mice by three - point bending . 23 Fractures were stabilized with a 25 g intramedullary pin . Femurs were harvested between 10 and 35 days post - fracture . Histology and TRAP Staining Fractured femurs were harvested and ﬁxed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 3 days . Following de - calciﬁcation , tissues were processed and embedded in parafﬁn . Five - micron sections were stained with Alcian blue / hematoxylin / Orange G or used for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) staining of osteoclasts . Tissue sections were stained with TRAP as previously described . 24 The number of multi - nucleated ( (cid:2) 3 nuclei / cell ) TRAP þ cells was counted in a 1 , 600 m m (cid:3) 735 m m area at the mid - point of the callus for each specimen . Three sections per specimen were analyzed , Additional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article . Correspondence to : Henry J .

JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH 2012 1 with 5 - m m sections analyzed from three depths of the tissue that were approximately 35 m m apart . The data are presented as mean TRAP þ osteoclasts / area (cid:4) SEM . Immunohistochemistry Parafﬁn sections were de - waxed , dehydrated , and underwent antigen retrieval using sodium citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) . Sections were probed with anti - Cx43 antibody ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO # SAB4300504 ) or anti - b - Galactosidase antibody ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY # A11132 ) diluted 1 : 500 in normal goat serum , followed by goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA # PK6101 ) , and staining was visualized with DAB chromo - gen ( Invitrogen ) . Sections were counterstained with methyl green . Negative control sections underwent the same proce - dure but were probed with anti - rabbit IgG ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA # 3900S ) at 1 : 500 . Histomorphometry The total tissue area of the callus was measured in NIH Image J ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) , the areas of mineralized tissue ( excluding cortical bone ) and cartilage ( as assessed by Alcian blue staining ) were then measured . Three sections per specimen were analyzed , with 5 - m m sections analyzed from three depths of the tissue that were approximately 35 m m apart . Three specimens per genotype / time - point were analyzed . The relative proportions of mineralized and cartilaginous tissue are expressed as a percentage of the total tissue area . Micro Computed Tomography Following harvest , specimens were scanned with a VivaCT 40 Scanner ( Scanco Medical AG , Bru¨ttisellen , Switzerland ) at high resolution with a voxel size of 10 . 5 m M . The reconstructed images were segmented and analyzed using the Image Processing Library supplied by the manufacturer . Micro computed tomography ( microCT ) analysis was complet - ed by selecting the approximate slice of fracture , and reconstructing 50 slices proximal and distal to this slice , resulting in a 100 slice segment of bone for analysis . Bone volume ( BV ) , total volume ( TV ) , and low - density BV were calculated by semi - manually segmenting axial slices to include the callus , and exclude cortical bone and the medullary cavity . Specimens were analyzed at thresholds of 200 and 300 . A threshold of 200 included high and low - density mineralized tissue , and calciﬁed cartilage , but excluded soft tissue and non - calciﬁed cartilage . A threshold of 300 included only high - density mineralized tissue . To account for changes in bone modeling / remodeling activity during healing , we used low - density BV as an indicator of the relative activity of healing . BV at 300 was subtracted from BV at 200 , resulting in total low - density BV . An increased amount of low - density bone indicates more actively remodeling bone . Callus TV included all tissue including mineralized and un - mineralized tissue . Biomechanical Torsion Testing Following harvest , and removal of intramedullary pins , specimens were potted in to square aluminum pots using poly [ methyl - meth - acrylate ] ( PMMA ) , rehydrated in phos - phate - buffered saline , and tested in torsion at a rate of 1 8 / s until failure using a 177N - mm load cell . Torsional rigidity was calculated as the slope of the linear region of the curve of rotational deformation ( Radians ) normalized to gage length ( mm ) versus torque ( N (cid:3) mm ) . Statistical Analysis A two - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by a Bon - feronni’s post - test was used to determine signiﬁcant differen - ces with respect to both genotype and time post - fracture . RESULTS Cx43 Is Widely Expressed in the Fracture Callus Cx43 is expressed in the fracture callus between 10 and 35 days ( Fig . 1A – E ) . Cx43 was expressed in Figure 1 .

Cx43 was also expressed in osteocytes ( yellow arrow , Fig . 2C ) , chondrocytes ( yellow arrow , Fig . 1A ) , and marrow cells ( yellow arrow , Fig . 1D ) . By 35 days post - fracture , a lack of Cx43 - positive cells were observed in the newly formed bone ( blue arrow , Fig . 1E ) . To assess the temporal - spatial pattern of Cre recombinase , tissue sections from Cx43cKO fractures were probed with anti - b - galactosidase antibody be - cause a LacZ reporter gene follows the ‘‘ﬂoxed’’ Cx43 DNA . 22 Following Cre - mediated recombination , and excision of Cx43 , expression of LacZ occurs . b - Galacto - sidase expression was observed in osteoblasts lining newly formed bone ( white arrows , Supplemental Fig . 1A – D ) , and osteocytes ( blue arrows , Supplemental Fig . 1A – D ) , showing a similar expression pattern to Cx43 in WT fractures ( Fig . 1 ) . Cx43cKO Fractures Heal With Decreased Mineralization A bridging cartilaginous callus was formed in WT and Cx43cKO by 10 days post - fracture ( Fig . 2A and B ) . By 14 days , cartilage was present in both genotypes ( Fig . 2C and D ) ; however , there was a larger area of cartilage in Cx43cKO fractures compared to WT ( Fig . 2K , p ¼ 0 . 0062 ) , while WT fractures had a greater proportion of mineralized tissue compared to Cx43cKO ( Fig . 2L , p ¼ 0 . 0133 ) . Small islands of mineralized tissue ( blue arrow , Fig . 2E ) were present in WT fractures at 21 days , while cortical bone , which had not been remodeled ( black arrows , Fig . 2F ) , at the fracture site is still present in Cx43cKO fractures . Additionally , Cx43cKO maintained a signiﬁcantly increased area of cartilaginous tissue ( Fig . 2K , p ¼ 0 . 0052 ) compared to WT at 21 days . By 28 days post - fracture , larger areas of mineralized tissue were present in the WT callus ( Fig . 2G , blue arrows ) , with a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion of mineralized Figure 2 .

Sections were stained with Alcian blue hematoxylin / Orange G . Cx43cKO fractures have larger areas of Alcian blue stained cartilage at 14 days ( D and K ) .

CONNEXIN43 AND FRACTURE HEALING 3 JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH 2012 tissue compared to Cx43cKO ( Fig . 2H and L , p ¼ 0 . 0215 ) , while minimal areas of mineralized tissue were present in Cx43cKO fractures and cortical bone remained un - remodeled ( Fig . 2H , black arrows ) . Cortical bridging and remodeling of the callus occurred in both WT and Cx43cKO by 35 days with no differen - ces in mineralized tissue ( Fig . 2I , J , and L ) . In addition to an increased area of cartilage in the Cx43cKO fractures at 14 and 21 days ( Fig . 2K ) , there was also persistent Alcian blue staining of cartilage in the callus of Cx43cKO fractures at 28 days ( Supplemental Fig . 2D ) , while Alcian blue staining was not present in WT fractures at this time ( Supplemental Fig . 2C ) . Decreased TRAP þ Osteoclasts in the Callus of Cx43cKO Fractures Signiﬁcant decreases in TRAP þ osteoclasts were observed in Cx43cKO fractures , relative to WT , on day 14 ( Fig . 3A and B , Table S1 ) , 21 ( Fig . 3C and D , Table S1 ) , and 28 ( Table S1 ) . At 14 days post - fracture there was a signiﬁcantly increased number of TRAP þ , multi - nucleated osteoclasts in WT fractures , compared to Cx43cKO fractures . By 21 days post - fracture , the number of TRAP þ osteoclasts decreased in both groups , with a further decrease at 28 days . By day 35 TRAP þ osteoclast number had decreased to the lowest number in each group , however , there was no signiﬁ - cant difference between WT and Cx43cKO fractures at this time - point . Callus Bone Volume and Total Callus Volume Are Decreased in Cx43cKO Fractures Three - dimensional microCT images reveal that WT and Cx43cKO both formed an initial callus by 14 days post - fracture . In WT mice there was progressive remodeling of the callus through 35 days resulting in a gradual decrease in callus size ( Fig . 4A – D ) . Cx43cKO fractures follow a similar pattern of healing , with extensive remodeling of the callus by 35 days as well ( Fig . 4E – H ) . Callus BV was signiﬁcantly increased at 14 days post - fracture in WT compared to Cx43cKO ( Fig . 4I , Table S2 , p ¼ 0 . 002 ) . Callus BV was decreased at 21 days post - fracture in both groups ( Fig . 4I , Table S2 ) ; however , these differences were not signiﬁcantly different . Callus BV was further decreased in both groups at 28 and 35 days with no Figure 3 .

JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH 2012 signiﬁcant differences between groups . Callus TV was highest in WT fractures at 14 days post - fracture , and signiﬁcantly increased compared to Cx43cKO at this time ( Fig . 4J , Table S3 , p ¼ 0 . 004 ) . TV was not signiﬁcantly different between WT and Cx43cKO at any other time - point . BV / TV was not signiﬁcantly different between WT and Cx43cKO fractures at any time between 14 and 35 days post - fracture , indi - cating that Cx43cKO fractures have concomitant decreases in both callus BV and TV . However , the proportion of mineralized tissue in Cx43cKO fractures is not signiﬁcantly different than WT fracture ( Fig . 4K , Table S4 ) . We used low - density BV as an indicator of bone remodeling . BV was measured at a low threshold ( high - and low - density ) , and high threshold ( high - den - sity ) . Low - density BV was calculated by subtracting high - density BV from total BV . At 14 days post - frac - ture , peak low - density BV was observed in both groups , with a signiﬁcant increase in WT compared to Cx43cKO ( Fig . 4L , Table S5 , p ¼ 0 . 0001 ) . Changes in low - density BV were not signiﬁcantly different be - tween WT and Cx43cKO between 21 and 35 days , with a progressive decrease over time ( Fig . 4L , Table S5 ) . Cx43cKO Fractures Have Decreased Torsional Rigidity No signiﬁcant changes in ultimate torque were ob - served between WT and Cx43cKO at any time - point , and ultimate torque was not signiﬁcantly increased in WT or Cx43cKO from 14 to 35 days ( Fig . 5A , Table S6 ) . In contrast , torsional rigidity was signiﬁcantly in - creased in WT fractures compared to Cx43cKO at 21 , 28 , and 35 days post - fracture . Torsional rigidity was not different between WT and Cx43cKO at 14 days ( p ¼ 0 . 92 ) . Peak torsional rigidity occurred in both groups at 21 days post - fracture but was signiﬁcantly increased in WT compared to Cx43cKO ( p ¼ 0 . 0012 ) , and was decreased at 28 days but remained signiﬁ - cantly increased in WT ( p ¼ 0 . 0195 ) relative to Cx43cKO . By 35 days , torsional rigidity was still sig - niﬁcantly increased in WT fractures compared to Cx43cKO ( Fig . 5B , Table S7 , p ¼ 0 . 0011 ) . DISCUSSION In this study , we have shown that Cx43 deﬁciency in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes results in decreased bone formation , remodeling , and biomechanical prop - erties during fracture healing . To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst study to identify an important role for Cx43 Figure 4 .

Cx43cKO fractures heal with signiﬁcant decreases in BV , less mineralization of the callus as assessed by histomorphometry , and de - creased torsional rigidity between 21 and 35 days post - fracture . These data support our hypothesis that loss of Cx43 during fracture healing results in de - creased osteoblast differentiation and bone formation , and is consistent with regulation of osteoblastic differentiation by Cx43 . 3 – 5 Stable transfection with Cx43 increases proliferation , and mineralization 2 as well as expression of osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein 3 in osteoblastic UMR 106 cells . Additionally , loss of Cx43 results in decreased alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) activity and osteocalcin expression in human fetal osteoblasts , 5 and osteoblastic cells from Cx43 null mice display decreased differentiation and mineralization compared to those from WT mice . 4 Defects in both intramembranous and endochondral ossiﬁcation are observed in Cx43 null mice , 4 further indicating the re - quirement for Cx43 in osteoblast differentiation and mineralization . In addition to bone formation , loss of Cx43 during fracture healing also alters bone resorption . Cortical bone at the fracture site remains un - resorbed in Cx43cKO fractures , while this bone is replaced by cal - lus , and new bone formation in WT fractures . Cx43cKO fractures also have fewer TRAP þ osteoclasts in the callus between 14 and 28 days , indicative of de - creased bone resorption . Cx43 is expressed in osteo - clasts in areas of active bone resorption 25 , 26 and inhibition of Cx43 expression and GJIC decreases oste - oclast formation , 19 degree of multi - nucleation , 27 and activity , 19 , 28 , 29 while abundant Cx43 expression is seen in the giant osteoclasts of Paget’s disease , 27 indicating the important role of Cx43 in regulating osteoclastogenesis . In this model of conditional Cx43 deﬁciency , only committed osteoblasts and osteocytes are affected , while expression of Cx43 should not be altered in osteoclasts . The decrease in TRAP þ osteo - clasts in Cx43cKO fractures may be a result of the decreased bone formation observed in the Cx43cKO mice ( by histomorphometry at 14 and 28 days ) , and as such , decreased substrate for osteoclasts to resorb , resulting in a need for fewer osteoclasts . Interestingly , the signiﬁcant decrease in the number of TRAP þ osteoclasts in the fracture callus of Cx43cKO mice is in contrast to the baseline phenotype of these mice . Recent work from our lab and others have shown an increased number of TRAP þ osteoclasts in Cx43cKO mice relative to WT , 11 , 30 while Watkins et al . 31 showed that increased osteoclastogenesis in Cx43cKO mice using the Dermo - 1 Cre was the result of decreased Osteoprotegerin ( Opg ) production by Cx43 - deﬁcient osteoblasts . We suspect this difference is due to the unique cellular milieu that accompanies fracture healing , with more immature osteoblasts and osteoblast precursors , as well as more active modeling / remodeling compared to un - fractured bone . In this genetic model of conditional Cx43 knockout , deletion of Cx43 does not occur until osteoblastic mat - uration enters the osteocalcin - expressing phase . 21 During fracture healing , periosteal progenitor cells mi - grate to the fracture site resulting in formation of a soft callus . These progenitor cells eventually differenti - ate to osteoblastic cells , which then mineralize the cal - lus . 32 , 33 Recent work by Ushiku et al . 34 has shown that initial mineralization of the fracture callus is ini - tiated by collagen I expressing cells , with minimal con - tribution by osteocalcin þ cells . This suggests that in our model , the majority of cells in the early healing stages have relatively normal Cx43 expression ; al - though there is a population of resident osteocalcin þ cells at the bone surface that react to the fracture by altering their orientation . 34 Despite the modest contri - bution of osteocalcin þ cells , and thus the low degree of Cx43KO in the fracture callus , Cx43cKO fractures dis - play diminished healing as evidenced by decreased mechanical properties . This suggests that cells outside the fracture environment may play an integral role in mineralization and remodeling of the fracture . One possible candidate for this cell is the osteocyte . Cx43 can regulate osteocyte survival , 30 and we have shown that Cx43 is expressed in cortical bone osteo - cytes during fracture healing . Osteocytes express both Osteopontin ( Opn ) , 35 and members of the BMP signaling family 36 during fracture healing , suggesting an important role for osteocytes in mineralization of the fracture callus . Thus , osteocytic , more so than os - teoblastic , Cx43 deﬁciency , may contribute to the changes in fracture healing we observed in Cx43cKO mice . Cx43 may also play an important role in the chon - drogenic phase of healing . Cx43 is expressed in the chondrocytes of the bridging callus , and a larger Alcian blue stained callus is observed in Cx43cKO fractures . While the role of Cx43 in chondrogenesis is not well understood , many studies have shown expres - sion of Cx43 in mature chondrocytes , 16 – 18 and during chondrogenic differentiation . 37 , 38 Inhibition of GJIC , or a dominant - negative form of Cx43 , leads to de - creased chondrogenesis 37 , 38 and impairs the condensa - tion phase of differentiation . 37 These data suggest that loss of Cx43 during fracture healing could result in a smaller cartilaginous callus , however , in this study , Cx43cKO fractures actually have a larger Alcian blue stained callus compared to WT . One explanation for this is that we are using Osteocalcin - Cre , resulting in deletion of Cx43 in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes . Expression of Cx43 in chondrocytes is not likely to be affected in this model , and as such , chondrogenesis probably progresses normally ; however , the transition to a mineralized callus , and replacement of the chon - drocytes is impaired due to loss of Cx43 in osteoblasts , as shown by the persistence of Alcian blue staining in the cKO callus at 28 days . This persistence of cartilage may explain the decreased torsional rigidity at 28 days post - fracture observed in the Cx43cKO , while the WT 6 LOISELLE ET AL . JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH 2012 callus has progressed to a more mineralized state at this time leading to improved biomechanics . The decreased torsional rigidity , or stiffness , we ob - served in Cx43cKO mice suggests not only impaired healing , but also indicates a difference in callus com - position . A callus composed of cartilage is less stiff than a more mineralized callus , 39 and increased micro - motion at the fracture site can delay consolidation and mineralization of the callus . 40 , 41 At 14 days post - frac - ture , there was a signiﬁcant increase in low - density BV in WT compared to Cx43cKO , suggestive of new woven bone formation . This is followed by histological observation of new islands of mineralized tissue and signiﬁcant improvements in torsional rigidity com - pared to both WT fractures at 14 days , and Cx43cKO fractures at 14 and 21 days . These data indicate that early formation of low - density woven bone in WT mice may result in the enhanced biomechanics of WT frac - tures at 21 – 35 days compared to Cx43cKO fractures . We have chosen to use biomechanical torsion testing , rather than three - point bending , as torsion testing results in equal torque across all areas of the callus , while three - point bending results in un - equal forces across the callus , so failure may not occur at the weak - est point of the fracture callus . 42 In summary , these studies identify a novel role for the gap junction protein Cx43 during fracture healing , suggesting that loss of Cx43 can result in decreased bone formation , and osteoclast activity . Therefore , en - hancing Cx43 expression or GJIC may provide a novel means to enhance bone formation during frac - ture healing . Indeed , PTH , which increases osteoblas - tic cell GJIC 43 also enhances fracture healing , 20 supporting the concept that targeting connexins and GJIC will improve fracture healing .
