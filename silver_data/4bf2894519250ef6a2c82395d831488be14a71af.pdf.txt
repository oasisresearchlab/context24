Here we present a high - throughput approach for 17 scarless endogenous fluorescent protein tagging in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus 18 elongatus PCC7942 . From 400 targets we successfully endogenously tag over 330 proteins 19 corresponding to > 10 % of the proteome . We demonstrate how this resource can be used at scale to 20 determine subcellular localisation , track relative protein abundances and to elucidate protein - protein 21 interaction networks . Our data has provided biological insights into a diverse range of processes - from 22 photosynthesis to cell division . Of particular interest , our ‘CyanoTag’ lines enabled us to visualise in real 23 time the rapid condensation of Calvin Cycle proteins Prk and Gap2 within seconds of withdrawal of 24 light , effectively ‘switching off’ photosynthesis in the dark . These insights , CyanoTag cell lines , 25 associated data and optimised methods are intended to be shared as a resource to facilitate further 26 discoveries relevant to cyanobacteria and more broadly to all photosynthetic life . 27 28 Introduction 29 Cyanobacteria fulfil essential roles in maintaining Earth’s atmosphere and ecosystems . These 30 photosynthetic prokaryotes make a significant contribution to global CO 2 fixation , O 2 production and 31 nutrient cycling 1 , 2 . They form intricate connections and symbioses across diverse ecosystems with their 32 imbalance leading to disastrous effects 3 . Via ancient primary endosymbiosis events that led to the 33 development of chloroplasts in eukaryotes , cyanobacteria have shaped the evolution of hugely diverse 34 plant and algal species 4 . Many photosynthetic genes and central metabolic processes remain 35 conserved between cyanobacteria and eukaryotic chloroplasts . Thus , understanding cyanobacterial cell 36 biology can contribute to advances in knowledge of fundamental cellular processes , chloroplast biology 37 and endeavours in photosynthetic engineering of plants 5 , 6 . In addition , their diversity , genetic tractability 38 2 and photosynthetic capability position cyanobacteria as promising chassis for green biotechnology 39 applications , including carbon capture and high - value product manufacture 7 . 40 Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 ( S . elongatus hereafter ) is a freshwater cyanobacterium , 41 the first to be transformed with exogenous DNA 8 and now a commonly - used model organism . Its 42 compact ( ~ 2 . 7 Mbp ) genome and elongated morphology with identifiable cellular structures also make it 43 an attractive organism for study . Despite the global importance of cyanobacteria and their widespread 44 use in research , a strikingly small proportion of cyanobacterial proteins have been characterised ; over a 45 quarter of S . elongatus genes lack any functional annotation , with most of the remainder annotated only 46 via bioinformatic methods ( through genetic homology to characterised genes in other species ) . Hence 47 there are significant gaps remaining in our understanding of fundamental biology relating to 48 photosynthesis , cell division , central metabolism and more . 49 The use of large - scale tagging approaches has led to significant insights in model systems 9 . 50 Most studies to date have focused on model organisms including yeast 10 , 11 , Caenorhabditis elegans 12 , 51 drosophila 13 , and human cells 14 . Some more recent studies have started to develop and apply large - 52 scale localisation approaches to other eukaryotic groups including the parasite Trypanosoma brucei 15 53 and the photosynthetic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 16 , 17 . Outside of Escherichia coli 18 large - scale 54 tagging has had limited application in prokaryotic systems and has yet to be applied to a photosynthetic 55 prokaryote . Furthermore , the application of endogenous , scarless fluorescent protein tagging via 56 chromosomal integration and subsequent removal of markers has yet to be applied at scale to 57 photosynthetic systems . To enable the rapid advancement of our knowledge of photosynthesis and 58 cyanobacterial cell biology , we built a pipeline for the generation of a library of S . elongatus lines 59 expressing fluorescently - tagged proteins amenable for use in protein localisation , expression and 60 interaction studies . Our approach involves the scarless tagging of each gene at its native locus , 61 maintaining endogenous regulatory regions and allowing tag fluorescence to be used as a proxy for 62 protein abundance . 63 Here we report the tagging and further characterisation of 330 protein - coding genes ( around 64 12 % of the S . elongatus genome ) , and examples of novel biological insights this has already provided . 65 We also present a preliminary protein interactome based on affinity purification experiments where we 66 detected over half the 2 , 714 known proteins in this organism . The interactome map is the first of its kind 67 for a cyanobacterial species and includes 369 high - confidence protein - protein interactions . As we 68 expand our libraries towards coverage of the entire S . elongatus proteome , we are sharing the growing 69 datasets via an interactive web tool ( https : / / morf - db . org / projects / York - Mackinder - Lab / MORF000032 ) . 70 We anticipate our cell libraries , associated data and optimised methods ( see Supplementary 71 information ) being valuable resources for research communities , providing insights into both known 72 processes and uncharacterised proteins in cyanobacteria and beyond . 73 74 Results 75 Development of CyanoTag , a high throughput protein tagging platform . 76 3 To advance our understanding of the S . elongatus proteome , we developed an approach to 77 scarlessly tag proteins at their native C - termini in a way that would facilitate the determination of each 78 protein ' s subcellular localisation , relative abundance and interacting proteins ( Fig . 1a ) . We used a 79 modified Golden Gate cloning approach to construct plasmids ( Fig . 1b ) , such that the constructs’ 80 integration into the genome by homologous recombination results in the 3’ tagging of the gene with the 81 bright monomeric green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen ( mNG ) and a 3xFLAG epitope , as well as the 82 introduction of positive and negative selectable markers downstream of the gene of interest and flanked 83 by copies of mNG to enable subsequent marker removal via a second homologous recombination 84 event ( Fig . 1b ) . 85 We transformed S . elongatus with each plasmid individually and selected for transgene 86 integration based on kanamycin resistance , conferred through the positive selection marker nptI . As S . 87 elongatus is polyploid we used increasing concentrations of kanamycin to ultimately isolate 88 homoplasmic “marked” mutants , in which every chromosomal copy of the gene of interest was 89 modified . To remove both selection markers to create “markerless” tagged mutants , we induced the 90 excision of the selectable markers via a second round of homologous recombination of the flanking 91 mNG genes using 5 - fluorocytosine ( 5 - FC ) which is hydrolysed to cytotoxic 5 - fluorouracil by the codA 92 gene product ( negative selection ) . We tested our pipeline on 400 target genes primarily associated with 93 photosynthesis and other processes of particular interest to the cyanobacteria research community , 94 using 96 - well plate formats for cloning , transformation and selection steps . Homoplasmic integration of 95 the tagging construct and successful marker removal were validated in each case by colony PCR ( Fig . 96 1c ) and introduction of the mNG and FLAG tags caused an ~ 30 kDa increase in observed protein 97 molecular weight ( Fig , 1d ) . 98 Each step in the plasmid cloning and selection of marked mutants had a success rate of 99 between 91 % and 99 % , allowing us to isolate homoplasmic tagged mutants for over 330 ( 82 . 5 % ) of our 100 target genes . ( Fig . 1e ) . Our tagging success rate is comparable to other large - scale endogenous 101 tagging studies 11 , 14 , 15 and higher than the ~ 53 % exogenous tagging success rate in the photosynthetic 102 alga C . reinhardtii that faces significant gene cloning challenges due to intron essentiality and high GC 103 content 16 , 17 . 104 105 4 106 Fig . 1 : A high - throughput fluorescent protein tagging pipeline in S . elongatus PCC 7942 . a , Overview of the 107 multipurpose 96 - well pipeline , which can be used to tag proteins of interest at their native loci for the study of protein 108 distribution , protein abundance and protein - protein interactions . AP - MS : affinity purification - mass spectrometry . b , 109 Schematic showing the pipeline for high - throughput protein tagging . Two homology arms ( HAs ) are amplified by PCR from 110 genomic DNA , and a BsaI - or BspQI - dependent Golden Gate cloning reaction is used to insert these HAs in place of two 111 cytotoxin - encoding ( ccdB ) genes in a backbone plasmid which contains a series of tagging and selection modules . These 112 are an mNeonGreen fluorescent protein and 3xFLAG epitope ( mNG / 3xFLAG ) tagging module , a kanamycin antibiotic 113 selection marker ( nptI ) and a negative selection marker ( codA ) followed by a second copy of the mNG / 3xFLAG module . 114 Following transformation of S . elongatus PCC7942 with these plasmids and selection with kanamycin , homologous 115 recombination leads to integration of the tagging and selection modules at the 3’ end of the target gene and the generation 116 of marked mutants . Markerless mutants are generated via a second recombination event , enhanced by selection with 5 - 117 5 fluorocytosine ( 5 - FC ) , between the two mNG / 3xFLAG modules . c , Example of colony PCRs showing the changes in locus 118 size as homoplasmic marked and markerless mutants are generated in the CyanoTag pipeline .

To aid classification of the fluorescent protein distribution for 127 each tagged cyanobacterial strain we built a decision tree based on the pattern of mNG fluorescence 128 and how it relates to the consistent pattern of cellular autofluorescence , which primarily arises from the 129 pigments in the thylakoid membranes ( Fig . 2a ) . We used this to describe the patterns of fluorescence 130 observed in each line using one or a combination of descriptors relating to diffuse patterns ( D ) , 131 membrane patterns ( M ) or puncta ( P ) ( Fig . 2b , 3a , 3b & S1 ) . 132 Amongst these images we observe a range of distinctive and / or novel localisation patterns . For 133 instance , using three lines where known carboxysome proteins were tagged , we see a characteristic 134 punctate pattern of mNG fluorescence along the central axis of the cell ( P1 ) ( Fig . 2b ) . In multiple other 135 examples , we show previously undescribed localisations for poorly characterised cyanobacterial 136 proteins such as Synpcc7942 _ 2044 ( P4 ) ( Fig . 2b ) . Little is known about Synpcc7942 _ 2044 , beyond its 137 likely essentiality 19 and as containing a PRC - barrel ( Photosynthetic Reaction Center - barrel ) , which are 138 speculated to have been acquired from purple bacteria and incorporated into the regulation of 139 cyanobacterial electron transport 20 . Its localisation to distinct puncta external to the thylakoids hints 140 either to a novel regulatory mechanism or a different function entirely . 141 A small proportion ( < 9 % ) of the proteins we describe here do not fit neatly into a single 142 localisation category ( Fig 3a , 3b , S1 ) . The Vipp1 protein ( Synpcc7942 _ 0794 ) is one such example , 143 where under our imaging conditions ( low - light ) we see a disperse cytoplasmic localisation of tagged 144 Vipp1 protein in most cells , but very bright puncta at the cell periphery in others ( Fig . 3a ) . Based on 145 previous observations , it is likely that in these cells Vipp1 is playing a role in maintaining the integrity of 146 the thylakoid membrane and / or protecting the cell from stress - induced damage 21 , 22 . 147 148 6 149 7 Fig . 2 : Subcellular locations of tagged proteins in S . elongatus PCC 7942 . a , Schematic overview of a decision tree 150 for assignment of proteins to classes ( or combinations of classes ) according to the localisation of mNG fluorescence . b , 151 Representative examples of tagged proteins ( green ) localising to each cluster in the set of S . elongatus markerless 152 mutants .

Underneath each overlay 153 the profile of fluorescence intensity across the length of the displayed cell is represented . The transects and raw values 154 from these analyses are displayed in Fig S1 . Scale bar : 1 μm . 155 156 The CyanoTag pipeline enables screening of in vivo protein abundances 157 Due to the maintenance of both native cis and trans regulatory elements in the markerless lines , 158 mNG can act as a strong proxy for protein abundance . Based on this property we developed a simple 159 flow cytometry - based fluorescence assay ( Fig . S2a ) and used it to determine the relative abundance of 160 proteins in live cells under standard growth conditions ( Fig . 3c & 3d ) . Fluorescence intensity was a 161 strong predictor that protein subcellular location could be assigned from imaging data ( Fig . 3c & 3d ) . 162 The trends in expression levels we observe in our flow cytometry data broadly reflect those observed in 163 published mass spectrometry datasets ( Fig . 3e ) 23 . This assay provides a platform by which changes in 164 protein expression , and also cellular morphology , can be assessed in a high - throughput manner 165 ( examples in later sections ) . 166 167 8 168 Fig 3 .

We then developed a bioinformatic pipeline to filter 181 mass spectrometry data , using a combination of CompPASS 24 and SAINT 25 analyses to define high 182 confidence interactors ( HCIs ) for each of the 82 bait proteins ( Fig . 4a & 4b ) . The data collated from 183 these initial bait proteins resulted in the identification of two or more peptides corresponding to 1 , 617 184 unique prey proteins representing ~ 60 % the entire S . elongatus proteome ( Fig . 4a ) . Of the 56 , 422 185 protein interactions detected , after filtering , 369 passed the thresholds to be HCIs . These data were 186 compiled into an initial protein interactome comprising 82 baits and 135 unique prey proteins , which 187 includes previously characterised interactions and highlights potentially novel ones ( Fig . 4c & S3 ) . 188 The resulting interactome map includes multiple interactions within and between known large 189 protein complexes , including photosystems I and II , the NDH - 1 complex , nitrate import proteins and the 190 circadian clock regulatory proteins KaiABC ( Fig . 4c ) . In cyanobacteria the NDH - 1 complex is found in 191 four isoforms , all that share a core common module but have different isoform specific subunits 26 . Using 192 the core structural component NdhN ( Synpcc7942 _ 2234 ) as bait eighteen other core or isoform specific 193 NDH - 1 subunits were identified as HCIs ( Fig . 4c ) . Using the AtpH subunit ( Synpcc7942 _ 0335 ) of the 194 ATP synthase complex as a bait , we detected HCIs with almost all of the known proteins of this highly 195 conserved complex 27 ( Fig . 4b , 4c & 4d ) . Only subunits of the membrane integral C - ring were not 196 classified as high - confidence interactors of AtpH . All four subunits of ATP synthase used as baits each 197 identify interactions - almost exclusively - with multiple other subunits of the complex ( Fig . 4c & 4d ) . 198 Amongst the HCIs are several examples of potentially novel interactions . Synpcc7942 _ 0551 is 199 an uncharacterised prey protein identified as interacting with three NDH1 - MS complex subunits ( Fig . 4c 200 & 4e ) . The interacting NDH1 subunits are adjacent to each other and in close proximity to the 201 plastoquinone - binding site of the complex ( Fig . 4e ) . This suggests the AP - MS pipeline could be 202 sufficiently powerful to resolve novel interactions to specific regions within a protein complex . 203 Synpcc7942 _ 0551 appears to be conserved across many cyanobacteria species and is structurally 204 consistent with being a transmembrane protein , however is absent in Thermosynechococcus elongatus 205 BP - 1 , the thermophilic cyanobacterium used for structural determination of the of the NDH1 206 complex 28 , 29 . 207 208 10 209 210 Fig . 4 : A preliminary S . elongatus protein interactome using CyanoTag lines . a , Overview of the AP - MS and 211 bioinformatic filtering pipeline , which was used to identify high confidence protein interactions from a biologically diverse 212 range of bait proteins . b , Representation of bioinformatic filtering of protein interactions for the bait AtpH , a well 213 11 characterised component of the ATP synthase complex .

Amongst these were observations related to the regulation of the Calvin cycle , 229 where we identified Synpcc7942 _ 0252 as a potential novel interactor of Gap2 and Prk ( Fig . 4c & 5a ) . 230 This protein contains a Cp12 - like domain but appears from our imaging and expression data to be 231 present at a level much lower than Cp12 ( Fig . 5b & 5c ) . Using our flow cytometry method , alongside 232 fluorescence microscopy , we detected increased fluorescence of mNG - tagged Synpcc7942 _ 0252 after 233 several hours of darkness ( Fig . 5c & 5d ) , corresponding with published analysis that showed the 234 transcription of the corresponding gene to be amongst the most highly upregulated in response to a 235 two - hour dark pulse 30 . 236 Cp12 is a known regulator of the Calvin cycle , thought to bind Gap2 and Prk to sequester them 237 away from the cycle under conditions non - optimal for sugar production 31 . Tagging of Gap2 and Prk with 238 mNG allowed us to visualise this process in real time , such that we could show the rapid relocalisation 239 of these tagged proteins from a diffuse localisation pattern to distinct puncta within seconds of light 240 being removed ( Fig . 5b , Movies S1 , S2 & S3 ) . These puncta are highly dynamic , able to fuse , and 241 appear to wet thylakoid membranes ( Fig . 5c , Movie S4 ) . These dynamic properties are widely 242 associated with biomolecular condensates that form through liquid - liquid phase separation 32 , however 243 further in vivo and in vitro supporting data is required to ascertain this 33 . Puncta still form in the absence 244 of Synpcc7942 _ 0252 ( Figs . S2b & S2c ) that we observed to interact with Gap2 and Prk , indicating that 245 this interaction is not essential to the dark - induced protein relocalisation . This is in agreement with the 246 low expression of Synpcc7942 _ 0252 during the rapid relocalisation of Gap2 and Prk observed upon 247 light to dark transition and would suggest that Synpcc7942 _ 0252 has a role after Gap2 / Prk puncta 248 formation ( Fig . 5c ) . 249 250 12 251 13 252 Fig . 5 : CyanoTag mutants allow visualisation and investigation of light - dependent regulation of the Calvin cycle . 253 a , Interactions detected between Gap2 , Prk , Cp12 and Cp12 - like ( Synpcc7942 _ 0252 ) by our AP - MS pipeline . b , Images 254 of Gap2 , Prk , Cp12 and Cp12 - like collected under standard conditions ( grown in constant light , then exposed to at least 255 5 minutes of darkness in the imaging chamber ) . c , Flow cytometry - based quantitation of the mNG fluorescence of these 256 proteins with and without 8 hours incubation in the dark .

Scale bars : 1μm . 264 265 Protein tagging provides further clues to protein function 266 By tagging previously uncharacterised proteins we stand to generate insights into where - and 267 subsequently how - they function . For example , by tagging Synpcc7942 _ 0011 , we identified the 268 brightest signals at the junctions between daughter cells as they separate from one another during the 269 division process ( Fig . 6a ) . This may indicate that Synpcc7942 _ 0011 functions during the process of cell 270 division . To investigate the function of Synpcc7942 _ 0011 we used a modified CyanoTag plasmid 271 vector to disrupt its genetic locus and create a knockout . Following the disruption of the 272 Synpcc7942 _ 0011 locus ( Fig . S2b ) we did not observe significant changes in cell size or shape by 273 fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 6a & 6b ) . Knockout lines were only slightly impaired in their growth rate 274 ( compared to wild - type and complemented strains ) , indicating that Synpcc7942 _ 0011 is not required 275 under our standard conditions ( Fig . 6c ) . Further investigation is required to determine what role this 276 previously uncharacterised protein is playing at sites of cell cleavage . 277 In addition to localisation information , we observed several striking cell shape phenotypes 278 during fluorescence imaging of three CyanoTag lines ; tagging of Synpcc7942 _ 2059 ( SepF ) or 279 Synpcc7942 _ 2378 ( FtsZ ) resulted in elongated cells whereas tagging Synpcc7942 _ 1104 ( RodA ) 280 resulted in shorter , wider cells ( Fig . 6d , 6e & 6f ) . In bacterial cell division , the FtsZ protein forms a 281 contractile ring at the midpoint of a growing cell , constricting to cause the separation of daughter cells . 282 The SepF protein is thought to play a role in assembling FtsZ filaments and recruiting them to the cell 283 membrane 34 . Genetic disruption of these two proteins has been shown previously to result in elongated 284 cells similar to those we observe in the corresponding CyanoTag lines 35 . Synpcc7942 _ 1104 is 285 annotated as a functional homologue of RodA , a protein thought to be involved in cell wall synthesis 286 and important for maintaining elongated cell shapes 36 . The morphological changes we observe in these 287 would be consistent therefore with the proteins’ functions being disrupted by the addition of the C - 288 terminal mNG tag . Fusion tags’ influence on protein function is a widely recognized caveat of 289 fluorescent protein tagging 11 , however as demonstrated here this impairment does not always preclude 290 the utility of these tagged lines , and may - in contrast - provide further insights into protein function . 291 14 292 293 294 Fig . 6 : CyanoTag mutants provide insights into mediators of cell division and morphology 295 a , Fluorescence microscopy showing S . elongatus populations with tagged ( middle ) and disrupted Synpcc7942 _ 0011 296 loci ( right ) . b , Analysis of cell dimensions of populations shown in a ) .

We 310 demonstrated the use of these tagged lines to gain insight into a range of attributes for over 330 311 proteins , including their localisations , abundance and interactions . Amongst the insights we have 312 gained from studying our CyanoTag lines were real - time observations of spatial and temporal regulation 313 of two key Calvin cycle proteins , Prk and Gap2 . Our AP - MS studies also identified a potential novel 314 interactor of Prk and Gap2 , though whether / how it regulates Calvin cycle dynamics will require further 315 investigation . Additionally , the generated protein - protein interactome has robustly assigned proteins of 316 unknown function to central , well - studied multimeric complexes , such as PSII and NDH - 1 . We were 317 also able to identify a possible role in cell wall dynamics for a previously uncharacterised protein 318 Synpcc7942 _ 0011 , initially clued via its striking localisation at the division sites of separating cells . 319 In this work , we report our initial pilot study targeting 400 of the 2 , 714 proteins encoded by the 320 S . elongatus genome . With optimised high - throughput protocols , using a multiplexed format which has 321 allowed significant reductions in resource and plastics usage , this pipeline is readily scalable . We are 322 already expanding our libraries , working towards greater coverage of the proteome , offering more 323 opportunities to observe novel biology and generate the first experimentally - defined whole cell 324 interactome of a photosynthetic organism . Our data is available publicly via our online platform at 325 https : / / morf - db . org / projects / York - Mackinder - Lab / MORF000032 which we will update as the project 326 progresses and has the capability of integrating parallel datasets from compatible studies on S . 327 elongatus . To further support the cyanobacterial research community , we are open to sharing our 328 CyanoTag lines with other researchers , and have also created and shared detailed protocols for each 329 step in our pipeline ( included in Supplementary Material ) . 330 331 Limitations of our datasets 332 As with all high - throughput strategies , there are some important limitations to be considered 333 when working with our datasets and tagged lines . Scarless tagging of proteins at their endogenous loci 334 has the great advantage of keeping native regulatory elements intact , but in any case , the addition of a 335 30 kDa tag at the C - terminus of a protein has the potential to impair normal protein function , 336 localisation , interactions or expression . This may preclude homoplasmic modification ( observed with 337 RbcS , Table S1 ) or result in growth impairment ( observed with SepF , Fig . 6 ) . However , this did not 338 prevent us from tagging at least one copy of our target gene in over 90 % of attempted transformations 339 ( Fig . 1e ) and observing correlation between our protein expression data and previously published 340 estimates of protein copy number ( Fig . 3e ) . In several cases , tagging interfering with protein function 341 16 allowed us to make inferences about the target protein’s role , for instance an elongated cell shape 342 implied a protein involved in cell separation had been disrupted ( Fig . 6e & 6f ) . 343 Where markerless mutants cannot be generated or are too greatly impaired , a possible 344 alternative is to use non - homoplasmic or marked CyanoTag lines maintained with kanamycin selection . 345 In the course of developing the pipeline , we noted generally increased expression of mNG in marked 346 mutants compared to their markerless counterparts ( particularly when tagged protein expression was 347 low ; Fig . S2e ) , suggesting that either some expression of the second mNG - 3xFLAG module ( Fig . 1b ) 348 can occur or that the efficient rrnB terminator 37 inserted downstream of the first mNG - 3xFLAG 349 consistently enhances gene expression / protein translation over the native terminator . Whilst this does 350 not preclude the use of non - homoplasmic or marked mutants in further studies , it is an important caveat 351 of their use , and is the reason our analyses in this manuscript focus on markerless lines . 352 The impact of the C - terminal tag , combined with the conditions in which we have imaged 353 CyanoTag lines also play into the confidence that can be placed in the localisations we have ascribed . 354 The images in our library were collected using the same set of growth and imaging conditions , and as 355 such we are not necessarily observing protein localisation in the conditions where each protein is 356 optimally expressed or at the location where it functions . The nutrient composition of the growth media 357 affects a range of proteins , for instance the balance of plastocyanin and other cytochromes shifts based 358 on copper availability 38 ; hence our use of < 300nM copper in our media may explain why we see low 359 expression of plastocyanin ( Table S1 ) . Similarly , because we grew our lines in constant light , we 360 observed low expression of the dark - induced Synpcc7942 _ 0252 under our standard imaging conditions 361 ( Fig . 5d ) . Our observations of Gap2 and Prk also highlight how dynamic protein localisation can be ; 362 these proteins play their primary role in the Calvin cycle in the cytoplasm , but quickly relocalise to an 363 alternate punctate location under our imaging conditions ( Fig . 5e & 5f , Movies S1 - 4 ) . We also 364 acknowledge that , even with experimental replication , most of our images are a snapshot of one 365 particular point during the log phase of each cell line’s growth and that our datasets are not capturing 366 oscillations of protein expression that are known to occur even under constant growth conditions 39 . We 367 encourage the use of our tagged lines in further studies of specific proteins or responses to conditions . 368 369 Conclusion 370 Photosynthetic organisms play a central role in ecosystem stability and global biogeochemical 371 cycling . There is a growing need to accelerate our understanding of photosynthetic microbes and to use 372 this knowledge to address huge global challenges relating to food security , threatened ecosystems and 373 the escalating climate crisis . The CyanoTag project aims to help unlock the potential that understanding 374 cyanobacterial biology can offer to these vital areas . 375 376 Methods 377 Cyanobacterial culture conditions . Mutants were generated on a WT Synechococcus elongatus PCC 378 7942 background . Cultures were maintained at 30 ℃ under constant light conditions ( 50 µmol 379 17 photons / m 2 / s ) on 1 . 5 % agar BG - 11 media plates . Liquid cultures were maintained in 1 mL volumes of 380 BG - 11 in deep 96 well plates and shaken on an orbital plate shaker at 150 rpm . 381 Plasmid design and Golden Gate cloning . Two CyanoTag template plasmids , pLM433 and pLM434 , 382 were constructed . Both plasmids contained two copies of the cytotoxin - encoding gene ( ccdB ) each 383 flanked by BspQ I ( pLM433 ) or BsaI ( pLM434 ) restriction sites . Present between the ccdB sequences 384 were a mNG / 3xFLAG tagging module , a kanamycin selection marker ( nptI ) and a negative selection 385 marker ( codA ) followed by a second copy of the mNG / 3xFLAG module . To generate plasmids capable 386 of integration at the 3’ end of each target gene , a Golden Gate cloning reaction was used to replace the 387 ccdB sequences with ~ 800 base pair homology arms that had been amplified from genomic DNA by 388 PCR . Target genes were selected on the basis of them being ( 1 ) known or associated with 389 photosynthesis ( see 40 for a review ) , ( 2 ) candidate CO 2 - concentrating mechanism ( CCM ) and low - CO 2 390 induced genes , including those identified from transcriptomic and proteomic studies 19 , 41 , 42 , or ( 3 ) 391 compartment markers . 392 Generation and selection of mutants . S . elongatus PCC7942 cultures were transformed by 393 incubation with plasmids overnight at 30 ℃ in the dark . Selection on BG - 11 agar plates containing 25 394 µg / mL kanamycin was used to isolate transformed cells which were then grown in wells of deep 96 - well 395 plates in 1 mL BG - 11 medium containing 25 µg / mL kanamycin . Cyanobacteria were selected on 396 increasing concentrations of kanamycin ( 50 , 100 and finally 200 µg / mL ) and homoplasmic marked 397 mutants were identified using colony PCR . “Markerless” mutants were then generated by homologous 398 recombination between the two mNG / 3xFLAG module via selection on BG - 11 agar containing 0 . 1g / L 5 - 399 FC . Homoplasmic markerless mutants were identified using colony PCR . Synpcc7942 _ 0011 & 400 Synpcc7942 _ 0252 knockout lines were generated using similar methods ; modified plasmids carrying a 401 kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by homology arms corresponding to the target gene were 402 transformed to induce insertional mutants ( Fig . S2b ) . To complement the Synpcc7942 _ 0011 knockout , 403 the Synpcc7942 _ 0011 coding sequence was amplified from the S . elongatus PCC 7942 genome and 404 inserted into the pSyn _ 6 vector which contains NS1 ( neutral site 1 ) homologous recombination regions 405 and a strong constitutive psbA gene promoter . Following transformation , colonies were selected with 50 406 μg / ml spectinomycin . Knockout and complemented lines were validated by colony PCR and 407 sequencing . 408 Fluorescence microscopy . Super - resolution imaging was performed using a Zeiss Elyra 7 409 microscope , using a lattice SIM 2 method , with the ‘scale to raw image’ parameter enabled . Images were 410 further processed using Fiji ( Image J ) . Comparison of the mNG and cellular autofluorescence ( mostly 411 from chlorophyll ) signal distribution was used to determine subcategories of protein localisation . Where 412 mNG signal was low and the resultant mNG localisations looked similar to that of WT cells , no 413 localisation descriptors were assigned . Fluorescence intensity profiles and quantifications of cell 414 dimensions were performed using the measurement tools in Fiji . For time - lapse imaging , samples were 415 incubated in the microscope chamber under 50 µmol photons / m 2 / s LED light until immediately prior to 416 recording . 417 18 Quantification of protein abundance . S . elongatus tagged mutant colonies were transferred to 96 - 418 well microplates containing BG - 11 medium and incubated at 30 ℃ under 50 µmol photons / m 2 / s light for 419 two days , after which they were analysed using a Cytoflex S cytometer . Live cells were gated based on 420 their autofluorescence and the median fluorescence intensity of this live cell population in the FITC 421 channel was used as a proxy for mNG fluorescence . 422 Affinity purification - mass spectrometry . Lines were prioritised for AP - MS based on having 423 significant protein expression , interesting localisations and / or being involved in diverse subcellular 424 processes . Tagged lines were grown in duplicate to log phase before being pelleted ( ~ 30 mg pellets ) 425 and snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen . Pellets were resuspended in an immunoprecipitation ( IP ) buffer ( 200 426 mM D - sorbitol , 50 mM HEPES , 50 mM KOAc , 2 mM Mg ( OAc ) 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 ) containing protease 427 inhibitors ( Roche cOmplete EDTA - free ) , 2 % digitonin , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 5 mM NaF and 0 . 15 mM Na 3 VO 4 . 428 Cells were lysed by agitation with 0 . 4 - 0 . 6 mm glass beads for 6 seconds followed by a 10 second 429 incubation on ice for a total of 15 minutes . Lysate was incubated with anti - mNeonGreen nanobody - Trap 430 Agarose beads ( ChromoTek ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , for 60 minutes on a rotating 431 platform at 20 rpm . Beads were washed three times with IP buffer containing 0 . 1 % digitonin followed by 432 a final wash in the absence of digitonin . All incubation steps were carried out at 4 ℃ . Purified proteins 433 were digested on - bead with the addition of 100 ng of Promega sequencing grade trypsin ( V5111 ) and 434 incubation at 37 o C overnight . Peptides were loaded onto EvoTip Pure tips for nanoUPLC using an 435 EvoSep One system . A pre - set 100 SPD gradient was used with a 8 cm EvoSep C 18 Performance 436 column ( 4 cm x 150 µ m x 1 . 5 µ m ) . The nanoUPLC system was interfaced to a timsTOF HT mass 437 spectrometer ( Bruker ) with a CaptiveSpray ionisation source ( Source ) . Positive PASEF - DIA , nanoESI - 438 MS and MS 2 spectra were acquired using Compass HyStar software ( version 6 . 2 , Thermo ) . Instrument 439 source settings were : capillary voltage , 1 , 500 V ; dry gas , 3 l / min ; dry temperature ; 180°C . Spectra were 440 acquired between m / z 100 - 1 , 700 . DIA fragmentation of 25 Th windows were used covering m / z 400 - 441 1201 and an ion mobility range of 0 . 6 - 1 . 6 1 / k0 . Collision energy was interpolated between 20 eV at 0 . 5 442 V . s / cm 2 to 59 eV at 1 . 6 V . s / cm 2 . Resulting data in . d format were searched using DIA - NN software 443 ( version 1 . 8 ) against a an in - silico predicted spectral library generated from the S . elongatus PCC 7942 444 subset of UniProt . DIA - NN peptide identifications were compiled with KNIME and data filtered to 1 % 445 FDR . Two peptides ( LATSPVLR & IAQVNLSR ) likely corresponding to trypsin autolysis peptides were 446 stripped from the results to prevent false positives . All mass spectrometry data sets , along with DIA - NN 447 search in - puts and results files are referenced in ProteomeXchange ( PXD049961 ) and are available to 448 download from MassIVE ( MSV000094128 ) [ doi : 10 . 25345 / C5VQ2SN3R ] . 449 AP - MS data analysis . DIA - NN - derived , non - normalised protein group quantification values from all 450 samples were run through a CompPASS package in R Studio and a continuous measurement variation 451 of SAINT analysis in Ubuntu . Interactions which fell in both the top 1 % WD score ( CompPASS ) and 7 % 452 AvgP score ( SAINT ) were defined as high confidence interactors . These were inputted into Cytoscape 453 for interactome generation . 454 More detailed supplementary methods are supplied and will be updated and shared publicly . 455 19 456 Acknowledgements 457 We thank the University of York Technology Facility , particularly Karen Hogg for flow cytometry 458 assistance and John Davey for initial bioinformatics support .
