Overexpression of EMS1 / cortactin in NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts causes increased cell motility and invasion in vitro Ankita S Patel , 1 Gary L Schechter , 2 William J Wasilenko 1 , 2 and Kenneth D Somers 1 , 2 Department of 1 Microbiology / Immunology and 2 Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery , Head and Neck Tumor Biology Program , Eastern Virginia Medical School , Norfolk , Virginia 23501 , USA Cortactin , a p80 / 85 protein ﬁrst identiﬁed as a src kinase substrate , is thought to be involved in the signaling pathway of mitogenic receptors and adhesion molecules mediating cytoskeletal reorganization . The cortactin gene , EMS1 , maps to chromosome 11q13 , a region ampliﬁed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC ) and breast cancer , which display lymph node metastasis and an unfavorable clinical outcome . To further address the role of cortactin in the malignant phenotype of cells , we stably overexpressed cortactin in NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts and evaluated the e(cid:128)ects of elevated cortactin on cellular proliferation , motility and invasiveness . Cortactin overexpressing cells did not display any striking morphological changes , nor any signiﬁcant di(cid:128)erences in cell proliferation or saturation density as compared to control NIH3T3 cells . Further - more , the cortactin overexpressing cells were anchorage dependent for growth . Interestingly , cortactin over - expressing cells were more motile and invasive in modiﬁed Boyden chamber assays . These results suggest that overexpression of cortactin may play a role in tumor progression by inﬂuencing tumor cell migration and invasion . Keywords : cortactin ; overexpression ; motility ; invasion Introduction Cortactin encoded by the EMS1 gene maps to the 11q13 amplicon , which is ampliﬁed in 30 % of head and neck squamous carcinoma and 13 % of primary breast cancer ( Schuuring et al . , 1992b ; Fantl et al . , 1993 ; Williams et al . , 1993 ; Karlseder et al . , 1994 ; Peters et al . , 1995 ) . DNA ampliﬁcation at 11q13 has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis in head and neck cancer ( Muller et al . , 1994 ) and in breast carcinoma ( Schuuring et al . , 1992a ) . Of the genes that map to the 11q13 amplicon , which include FGF - 3 and FGF - 4 ( Casey et al . , 1986 ; Adelaide et al . , 1988 ) , only cyclin D1 and EMS1 have been reported to be overexpressed in tumors with 11q13 ampliﬁcation ( reviewed in Hall and Peters , 1996 ) . Cyclin D1 ampliﬁcation and expression has been observed in carcinoma of the breast , esophagus and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) ( Schuuring et al . , 1992b ; Buckley et al . , 1993 ; Jiang et al . , 1993 ; Xu et al . , 1994 ) , and EMS1 ampliﬁcation has been directly correlated to its expression in HNSCC cell lines ( Patel et al . , 1996 ) and recently in breast carcinoma ( Campbell et al . , 1996 ) . This suggests that overexpression of both cyclin D1 and / or EMS1 may contribute to the metastatic phenotype correlated with 11q13 ampliﬁcation . Evidence from several studies has demonstrated the involvement of cyclin D1 in tumorigenesis . Transfec - tion of cyclin D1 in rodent ﬁbroblasts and immorta - lized esophageal cells results in cellular transformation ( Hinds et al . , 1994 ; Lovec et al . , 1994 ; Okamoto et al . , 1994 ) . Furthermore , transgenic mice harboring the cyclin D1 transgene develop mammary hyperplasia and adenocarcinomas ( Wang et al . , 1994 ) . In compar - ison , the consequences of cortactin overexpression remain speculative . Cortactin has been demonstrated to be an actin - binding protein and one of the major phosphotyrosine proteins present in cells transformed by the src tyrosine kinase oncogene ( Kanner et al . , 1990 ; Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Localization studies have shown cortactin associated with the cytoskeleton and cell contact sites , suggesting that overexpression of cortactin may inﬂuence cell adhesion , migration and / or invasive potential . To investigate the inﬂuence of cortactin overexpression on the transformed cell phenotype , we stably overexpressed the human EMS1 / cortactin gene in NIH3T3 mouse ﬁbroblasts . We found that clonal cell populations overexpressing cortactin did not display any changes in morphology or cellular growth . However , cortactin transfectants were more motile and invasive in modiﬁed Boyden chamber assays than the vector control cell lines . These results provide evidence that cortactin can inﬂuence cell migration and invasive capacity , and thereby raise the possibility that cortactin overexpression in tumors may contribute to enhanced tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Results Overexpression of human EMS1 / cortactin cDNA in NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts To address the role of cortactin in cellular transforma - tion , we overexpressed human cortactin in NIH3T3 mouse ﬁbroblast cells . The 1 . 7 kb EMS1 cDNA fragment was cloned into pSVsport . 1 ( Gibco , BRL ) and the resultant vector pSVsport . 1 . ems - 1 , together with pSV 2 neo , were cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells using polybrene and DMSO . Following G418 selection , 24 individual neomycin resistant clones were randomly picked . To assess the expression of the transfected human EMS1 gene in the NIH3T3 cells , Western blot analysis using anti - human cortactin antibody ( RA444 ) was performed .

Three of these clones , termed Ems1 , Ems2 and Ems4 were selected for further studies . Several control clones , Neo1 , Neo2 , Neo3 and Neo4 isolated from cultures transfected with pSV 2 neo alone were analysed in parallel with the Ems - 1 overexpressing cell lines . Figure 1a shows Western blot analysis of the three individual cortactin expressing clones ( Ems1 , Ems2 and Ems4 ) and the four neo control clones ( Neo1 , Neo2 , Neo3 and Neo4 ) . FaDu , a previously described cortactin overexpressing HNSCC cell line was used as a positive control for endogenous human cortactin expression ( Patel et al . , 1996 ) . Because NIH3T3 cells express endogenous cortactin , we assessed the total amount of cortactin ( endogenous and exogenous ) in EMS1 transfected cells compared to neo transfected cells by blotting with cortactin monoclonal antibody 4F11 which recognizes both human and mouse cortactin ( Figure 1b ) . The ﬁndings demonstrate a marked overexpression of the 85kD isoform of cortactin in Ems1 , Ems2 and Ems4 cells . Previous studies have demonstrated that cortactin has a submembraneous localization in the cell cortex , including cell leading edges , membrane ru(cid:130)es and ﬁlopodia ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . We therefore performed immunoﬂuorescence using monoclonal cortactin antibody 4F11 to determine the subcellular localization of the cortactin protein expressed in the cortactin overexpressing clonal cell lines . Intense staining in the cytoplasm , around the nucleus , leading edges and membrane ru(cid:130)es was observed in the Ems1 and Ems4 overexpressing cell lines ( Figure 2a and b respectively ) . Much weaker staining due to endogenous mouse cortactin was seen in the control cell line Neo3 ( Figure 2c ) . Thus , consistent with the known sub - cellular localization of the endogenous cortactin , the stably overexpressed human cortactin is also localized to the cell cortex , leading edges , membrane ru(cid:130)es and ﬁlopodia . Cortactin overexpression in NIH3T3 cells does not alter cell growth The three cortactin overexpressing clones , Ems1 , Ems2 , Ems4 and four control clones , Neo1 , Neo2 , Neo3 and Neo4 were assayed for cell growth by direct cell enumeration or by the MTS cell proliferation assay ( Promega ) in standard media containing 10 % FCS . Figure 3 shows a representative experiment of growth curves obtained by direct cell counts . There was no signiﬁcant di(cid:128)erence in the growth of the cortactin overexpressing cell lines ( Ems1 , Ems2 , Ems4 ) and the control cell lines ( Neo1 , Neo2 , Neo3 , Neo4 ) . Similar results were obtained when cell growth was assessed by the MTS assay ( data not shown ) . To assess the e(cid:128)ect of cortactin expression on anchorage independent growth , cortactin overexpressing cells and neo controls were seeded in soft agar . The cortactin overexpressing clones and the neo controls were anchorage dependent and did not form colonies in soft agar ( data not shown ) . Therefore , stable overexpression of cortactin did not alter the in vitro growth phenotype of NIH3T3 ﬁbroblast cells . Cortactin overexpression in NIH3T3 cells enhances cell motility and invasion Since 11q13 ampliﬁcation is correlated with lymph node metastasis , we sought to determine the role of Ems1 in invasion . The process of tumor cell invasion consists of three steps : ( a ) tumor cell adhesion to the basement membrane ; ( b ) degradation / proteolysis of the basement membrane ; and ( c ) tumor cell migration into secondary sites . Therefore , we investigated cell motility and the invasive capacity of the cortactin overexpres - sing cell lines in modiﬁed Boyden chamber assays using NIH3T3 conditioned medium as a chemoattractant . Figure 4 demonstrates that cortactin overexpressing NIH3T3 clones ( Ems1 , Ems2 and Ems4 ) were nearly twofold more motile than the control cells ( Neo1 , Neo2 , Neo3 , Neo4 ) , P (cid:53) 0 . 001 . Similarly , the invasive potential of the cortactin overexpressing NIH3T3 cells , as assessed by measuring the ability of cells to transverse a reconstituted basement membrane of Matrigel , was greater in the three cortactin over - expressing cells Ems1 , Ems2 and Ems4 , as compared to the control cells , Neo1 , Neo2 , Neo3 and Neo4 , P (cid:53) 0 . 05 ( Figure 5 ) . Despite the twofold variability seen between Neo1 , Neo2 , and Neo3 , Neo4 clones , cortactin - overexpressing clones were consistently more invasive than the Neo controls . Discussion In an attempt to study the role of cortactin over - expression in tumor cells , we examined the in vitro transforming potential of cortactin in NIH3T3 cells .

FaDu , a human derived HNSCC cell line , was used as a positive control . ( b ) Endogenous expression of cortactin in NIH3T3 cells . Western blot analysis was performed using monoclonal cortactin antibody 4F11 that crossreacts with human cortactin on extracts of Ems1 , Ems2 , and Neo1 cells (cid:79)(cid:118)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:120)(cid:112)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:115)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110) (cid:111)(cid:102) (cid:99)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:97)(cid:99)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:110) (cid:105)(cid:110) (cid:78)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:51)(cid:84)(cid:51) (cid:102)(cid:105)(cid:98)(cid:114)(cid:111)(cid:98)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:115)(cid:116)(cid:115) (cid:65)(cid:83) (cid:80)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:108) (cid:101)(cid:116) (cid:97)(cid:108) (cid:51)(cid:50)(cid:50)(cid:56) overexpression did not alter the growth phenotype of ﬁbroblasts but did enhance the cell migratory and invasive potential of NIH3T3 cells . The later observa - tion suggests that cortactin overexpression may be one contributing factor in tumor cell invasion / metastasis , which is consistent with previously poor clinical outcome in some human head and neck , and breast cancer patients with 11q13 ampliﬁcation ( Muller et al . , 1994 ; Schuuring et al . , 1992a ) . Further experimentation thus appears warranted to examine if cortactin overexpression is su(cid:129)cient for enhanced tumor cell invasion in vivo . Although the biological function of cortactin is poorly understood , there are several properties of cortactin that suggest it may participate in events involved with cell migration and invasion . Cortactin is a multidomain cytoskeleton - associated protein enriched in the cell cortex , including cell leading edges , ru(cid:130)es and ﬁlopodia ( Maa et al . , 1992 ) . The protein has been found to localize to podosome structures in two head Figure 2 Immunolocalization of cortactin in the Ems - 1 overexpressing NIH3T3 cell lines . Ems - 1 overexpressing cell lines Ems1 ( a ) , Ems4 ( b ) and a control cell line Neo3 ( c ) were grown on Lab - Tek chamber slides and stained with mAb 4F11 ( See Materials and methods ) (cid:79)(cid:118)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:120)(cid:112)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:115)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110) (cid:111)(cid:102) (cid:99)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:97)(cid:99)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:110) (cid:105)(cid:110) (cid:78)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:51)(cid:84)(cid:51) (cid:102)(cid:105)(cid:98)(cid:114)(cid:111)(cid:98)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:115)(cid:116)(cid:115) (cid:65)(cid:83) (cid:80)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:108) (cid:101)(cid:116) (cid:97)(cid:108) (cid:51)(cid:50)(cid:50)(cid:57) and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and a breast cancer cell line with 11q13 ampliﬁcation ( Schuuring et al . , 1993 ) . These are areas in the cell where cytoskeletal reorganizations are believed to occur prerequisite to cell migration over and degrada - tion of extracellular matrices ( Chen , 1989 ) . Further - more , cortactin’s domain structure consists of several tandem repeats in the amino terminus which have been shown to bind to actin , at least in vitro ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . Other domains of cortactin consist of proline , serine and threonine rich regions , as well as a carboxy terminal SH3 domain . These regions of cortactin could conceivably interact with a variety of proteins involved with initiation and maintenance of cell migration . Additionally , studies showing that the tyrosine phosphorylation level of cortactin can be elevated in response to several growth and migratory stimuli , including EGF and FGF ( Maa et al . , 1992 ; Zhan et al . , 1993 ) , ICAM - 1 adhesion molecules ( Durieu - Trautman et al . , 1994 ) and integrin - mediated attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix ( Vuori and Ruoslahti , 1995 ) , strengthens the notion that cortactin is an important intermediate in signaling cascades inﬂuencing cytoskeletal architecture . An important step in metastasis is the ability of the tumor cell to migrate into secondary sites . Such cell movement is believed to be achieved through a highly regulated and dynamic network of polymerized , cross - linked actin ﬁlaments at the leading edges of cells , termed lamellipodia ( Cunningham , 1992 ) . Cross - linking of ﬁlamentous actin into bundles or lattices at lamellipodia is thought to provide the protrusive force necessary for the forward extension of membranes and cell locomotion ( Cunningham , 1992 ) . Actin cross - linking proteins appear to play an important role in the creation of these actin bundles / lattices , as illustrated by studies with the ABP280 cross - linking protein in human melanoma cells ( Cunningham et al . , 1992 ) . In melanoma cells lacking ABP280 , pseudopod extension and cell locomotion is impaired ; however , cell motility can be increased in these cells by expression of ABP280 ( Cunningham et al . , 1992 ) . Interestingly , cortactin has recently been found to exhibit ﬁlamentous actin cross - linking activity and this activity is decreased when cortactin is phosphorylated by the c - src kinase in vitro ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , Figure 3 Growth rate analysis of the cortactin overexpressing cell lines Ems1 , Ems2 , Ems4 and control cell lines Neo1 , Neo2 , Neo3 and Neo4 . 2 (cid:54) 10 4 cells / well were plated in 24 well plates and cells from duplicate wells of each cell line were trypsinized and counted on days 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 to generate growth curves . The cell numbers are presented as mean values . Similar results were obtained in three replicate experiments Figure 4 E(cid:128)ect of cortactin overexpression on cell motility . Cell motility through gelatin coated polycarbonate ﬁlters in response to NIH3T3 conditioned media was assayed in modiﬁed Boyden chambers as described in Materials and methods . Data are mean and standard error of four experiments . The cortactin over - expressing cell lines Ems1 , Ems2 and Ems4 were statistically more motile than the control cell lines Neo1 , Neo2 , Neo3 and Neo4 ( P (cid:53) 0 . 01 , using ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test ) Figure 5 E(cid:128)ect of cortactin overexpression on cell invasion in Boyden chamber assays . Cell invasion was assayed in modiﬁed Boyden chambers with ﬁlters coated with Matrigel as described in Materials and methods . The results are the mean and standard error of three experiments . The cortactin overexpressing cell lines Ems1 , Ems2 and Ems4 were more invasive than the control cell lines Neo1 , Neo2 , Neo3 and Neo4 ( P (cid:53) 0 . 05 , using ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test ) (cid:79)(cid:118)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:120)(cid:112)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:115)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110) (cid:111)(cid:102) (cid:99)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:97)(cid:99)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:110) (cid:105)(cid:110) (cid:78)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:51)(cid:84)(cid:51) (cid:102)(cid:105)(cid:98)(cid:114)(cid:111)(cid:98)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:115)(cid:116)(cid:115) (cid:65)(cid:83) (cid:80)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:108) (cid:101)(cid:116) (cid:97)(cid:108) (cid:51)(cid:50)(cid:51)(cid:48) enhanced motility observed following cortactin over - expression in NIH3T3 cells may involve dynamic modulations of actin cross - linking at lamellipodia mediated by cortactin . Precisely how cortactin is regulated in the dynamic actin cytoskeleton remains to be studied . Tyrosine and / or serine / threonine phosphorylations are likely to play a role in cortactin regulation . Phosphorylation at tyrosine residues in cortactin has been observed in response to several extracellular ligands , and research has demonstrated serine / threonine phosphorylation of cortactin as well ( Van Damme et al . , 1997 ) . Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro mediated by pp60c - src was recently shown to down regulate actin cross - linking activity ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Further studies of how phosphorylation at speciﬁc amino acid residues regulate cortactin structure and function will provide a better understanding of the complex process of cell adhesion and locomotion . Recently , van Damme et al . , ( 1997 ) reported that the redistribution of cortactin to contact sites in a HNSCC cell line with 11q13 ampliﬁcation coincides with its post translational modiﬁcation and speculated that the modiﬁcation is due to an unknown serine / threonine phosphorylation activated only in the tumors with 11q13 ampliﬁcation . Interestingly , cyclin D1 , which also maps to the 11q13 amplicon , has been shown to associate with cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDK ) , CDK4 and CDK6 in a HNSCC cell line ( Bates et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , we speculate that CDKs associated with cyclin D1 might phosphorylate cortactin at consensus CDK phosphorylation sites ( Schuuring et al . , 1993 ; Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Such an event may be one means by which cyclin D1 and EMS1 genes cooperate in the development and progression of tumors with 11q13 ampliﬁcation by promoting cell cycle progression and tumor cell migration / invasion , respectively . Future studies aimed at identifying the initiating factors of cortactin modiﬁcation and the identiﬁcation of its interacting protein partners will help to elucidate the role of cortactin in cell migration and the process of tumorigenesis . Materials and methods Cell culture NIH3T3 ﬁbroblast cell line and its derivatives were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , Gibco ) , supplemented with antibiotics , plus 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . Medium for cell lines containing the neomycin resistance gene was supplemented with 400 (cid:109) g / ml G418 ( Gibco ) . Construction of EMS1 expression vector and DNA transfection The full length 1 . 7 kb human EMS1 cDNA ( provided by Dr Michalides ) was cloned into the SmaI – XbaI site of the pSVsport . 1 vector ( Gibco , BRL ) . For transfection experi - ments , the plasmid DNA was puriﬁed twice by cesium chloride centrifugation . NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts were cotrans - fected with pSVsport . 1 . ems - 1 and pSV 2 neo using polybrene ( Sigma ) . Brieﬂy , 2 (cid:54) 10 6 cells were seeded in 100 mm dishes and grown overnight in DMEM with 10 % FBS and 2 (cid:109) g / ml polybrene . The growth medium was replaced with 0 . 5 ml growth medium containing 20 (cid:109) g / ml polybrene , 10 (cid:109) g pSVsport . 1 . ems - 1 DNA , 0 . 3 (cid:109) g pSV 2 neo DNA and incubated at 37 (cid:56) C . After 6 h the growth medium was replaced with 3 ml of cold DMEM + 30 % DMSO ( shock solution ) for 3 . 5 min . The shock solution was removed and cells washed once with growth media and incubated overnight at 37 (cid:56) C . Cells were selected in growth medium containing 400 (cid:109) g / ml G418 and G418 resistant colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders and expanded as individual clones . Control NIH3T3 cells were transfected as above but only with pSV 2 neo . Western blot analysis Lysates were made and protein concentration determined as previously described ( Patel et al . , 1996 ) . For immuno - blotting , 25 (cid:109) g of crude lysate were separated by 7 . 5 % SDS – PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes . Membranes were blocked in 3 % BSA for 1 h at 37 (cid:56) C , and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti - human cortactin antibody , RA444 at a 1 : 5000 dilution ( generously supplied by Dr E Schurring ) . Proteins were visualized by incubating with peroxidase labeled anti - rabbit IgG followed by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL , Amersham ) . Immunoﬂuorescence 5 (cid:54) 10 4 cells were seeded on Lab - Tek chamber slides ( Nunc ) and processed for immunoﬂuorescence with anti - cortactin antibody , 4F11 ( kindly supplied by Dr T Parsons ) as previously described ( Patel et al . , 1996 ) . Photographs were taken at 20 (cid:54) on Kodak Ektachrome Elite ﬁlm . Growth analysis 2 (cid:54) 10 4 cells / well were plated in 24 well cluster dishes . Cells were fed every 3 days with DMEM + 10 % FCS + 400 (cid:109) g / ml G418 . On days 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 and 11 , two wells were trypsinized and cells counted with a hemocytometer . For growth analysis using the MTS assay ( Promega ) , 3 (cid:54) 10 3 cells / well were plated in a 96 well plate and cell proliferation assays in triplicate wells were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol on days 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 11 . For anchorage independent growth , 2 . 5 (cid:54) 10 3 cells were seeded into 24 well cluster dishes in growth medium containing 0 . 35 % agar . Colonies 0 . 1 mm in diameter in duplicate wells were counted after 14 days incubation at 37 (cid:56) C . Cell migration and invasion assays Both assays were done in a 48 well modiﬁed Boyden chamber . Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in DMEM + 10 % FBS and incubated 1 h at room tempera - ture . The cells were then pelleted and suspended to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 (cid:54) 10 6 cell / ml in DMEM containing 0 . 1 % BSA . The lower wells of the chamber were ﬁlled with NIH3T3 serum free conditioned media , obtained by incubation of cells for 24 h and used as a source of chemoattractants . For cell migration assays , the chamber was assembled using polycarbonate ﬁlters ( 8 (cid:109) m pore size , Nucleopore , CabinJohn , MD ) coated with 0 . 01 mg / ml gelatin . For invasion assays the ﬁlter was ﬁrst coated with Type IV collagen ( 5 (cid:109) g / ﬁlter ) ( Gibco ) and air dried . Matrigel ( 1 mg / ml ) was layered onto each ﬁlter ( 500 (cid:109) g / ﬁlter ) . A 56 (cid:109) l sample of cell suspension ( 2 (cid:54) 10 6 cells / ml ) was added to the upper compartment and incubated at 37 (cid:56) C in 5 % CO 2 for 4 h . At the end of the incubation , the cells on the upper surface of the ﬁlters were mechanically removed . Filters were ﬁxed in methanol and stained in Di(cid:128) - Quik ( Baxter , McGaw , IL ) . Migrating / invading cells were quantiﬁed by counting 4 – 9 high power ﬁelds ( (cid:54) 200 ) (cid:79)(cid:118)(cid:101)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:120)(cid:112)(cid:114)(cid:101)(cid:115)(cid:115)(cid:105)(cid:111)(cid:110) (cid:111)(cid:102) (cid:99)(cid:111)(cid:114)(cid:116)(cid:97)(cid:99)(cid:116)(cid:105)(cid:110) (cid:105)(cid:110) (cid:78)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:51)(cid:84)(cid:51) (cid:102)(cid:105)(cid:98)(cid:114)(cid:111)(cid:98)(cid:108)(cid:97)(cid:115)(cid:116)(cid:115) (cid:65)(cid:83) (cid:80)(cid:97)(cid:116)(cid:101)(cid:108) (cid:101)(cid:116) (cid:97)(cid:108) (cid:51)(cid:50)(cid:51)(cid:49) using an Image Analyzer . The average number of cells per high power ﬁeld was multiplied by 20 to obtain the total number of cells that had migrated or invaded through the membrane . Each sample was assayed in triplicate , and the experiments were repeated four times . All data presented are means and standard error of three wells from at least three experiments . Statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated with analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Tukey’s Honestly Signiﬁcant Test ( HSD ) test .
