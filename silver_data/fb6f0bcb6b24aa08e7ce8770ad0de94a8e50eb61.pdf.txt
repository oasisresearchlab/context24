Foraging , Exploration , or Search ? On the ( Lack of ) Convergent Validity Between Three Behavioral Paradigms Bettina von Helversen University of Zurich Rui Mata University of Basel Gregory R . Samanez - Larkin Duke University Andreas Wilke Clarkson University Recently it has been suggested that individual humans and other animals possess different levels of a general tendency to explore or exploit that may inﬂuence behavior in different contexts . In the present work , we investigated whether individual differ - ences in this general tendency to explore ( exploit ) can be captured across three behavioral paradigms that involve exploration – exploitation trade - offs : A foraging task involving sequential search for ﬁsh in several ponds , a multiarmed bandit task involv - ing repeatedly choosing from a set of options , and a sequential choice task involving choosing a candidate from a pool of applicants . Two hundred and sixty - one participants completed two versions of each of the three tasks . Structural equation modeling revealed that there was no single , general factor underlying exploration behavior in all tasks , even though individual differences in exploration were stable across the two versions of the same task . The results suggest that task - speciﬁc factors inﬂuence individual levels of exploration . This ﬁnding causes difﬁculties in the enterprise of measuring general exploration tendencies using single behavioral paradigms and sug - gests that more work is needed to understand how general exploration tendencies and task - speciﬁc characteristics translate into exploratory behavior in different contexts . Public Signiﬁcance Statement Many tasks require balancing the need to exploit known options and to explore new ones . The present study investigated whether individual tendencies to explore or exploit generalize across three different tasks and found that exploration was highly task speciﬁc : Someone who explored a lot in one task did not necessarily explore much in another . More work is needed to understand the task features that drive exploration .

There has been considerable interest in understanding how humans deal with such exploration – exploita - tion trade - offs , involving the use of a number of behavioral paradigms that mimic requirements of searching for food , mates , and other re - sources ( Mehlhorn et al . , 2015 ; Wilke , in press ) , such as foraging for ﬁsh in ponds ( Hutchinson , Wilke , & Todd , 2008 ) , exploring options from an array ( Cohen , McClure , & Yu , 2007 ) , or searching for a suitable candidate from a pool ( von Helversen , Wilke , Johnson , Schmid , & Klapp , 2011 ) . But do individuals’ exploration – exploitation tendencies generalize across such varied problems ? Some have argued that individuals’ explora - tion tendencies may be a trait , akin to person - ality , in humans ( Somerville et al . , 2017 ) and other animals ( Bell , Hankison , & Laskowski , 2009 ) . Importantly , behavioral ecologists sug - gest that domain - general personality traits can arise whenever the environment cues the devel - opment of basic physiological or cognitive makeup in early life , with implications for the full life span ( Dall , Houston , & McNamara , 2004 ; Sih & Del Giudice , 2012 ) . For example , it has been suggested that stressful early life ex - periences cue future environmental uncertainty and lead to general explorative tendencies be - cause these are adaptive in such harsh environ - ments ( Frankenhuis & de Weerth , 2013 ; Sih & Del Giudice , 2012 ) . Another source of evidence for the generality of exploration tendencies comes from research suggesting that the control of exploration and exploitation is driven by a domain - general mechanism that can affect exploration across different domains and tasks , such as internal ( i . e . , in memory ) and external ( i . e . , in the envi - ronment ) search ( Hills et al . , 2015 ; Pirolli , 2007 ) . This hypothesis is supported by research showing that different kinds of exploration – exploitation tasks , such as foraging for food or searching for words in memory , may rely on similar cognitive strategies ( e . g . , Hutchinson et al . , 2008 ; Wilke , Hutchinson , Todd , & Cziens - kowski , 2009 ) , have similar neurobiological roots ( Hills , 2006 ; Hills , & Dukas , 2012 ; Hills et al . , 2015 ) , and can be behaviorally primed by each other ( Hills , Todd , & Goldstone , 2008 ) . Despite these lines of evidence that suggest domain - generality of individual exploration – exploitation tendencies , little is known about the empirical convergence of individual differ - ences in exploration – exploitation tendencies across different tasks . Yet , assessing whether exploration tendencies generalize across tasks could help determine the structure of a general control mechanism for exploration – exploita - tion ; in particular , any lack of generalizability across speciﬁc situations could indicate poten - tial boundaries of this general control mecha - nism or , alternatively , that the same mechanism interacts with task characteristics to produce different levels of exploration . In the following , we brieﬂy introduce three paradigms that have been used to understand how humans deal with exploration – exploitation trade - offs , and then report a convergent validity test of individual exploration – exploitation ten - dencies across these paradigms . Three Paradigms Involving Exploration – Exploitation Trade - Offs Foraging In foraging tasks , people gather rewards by foraging in patches that differ in the number of rewards they contain ( e . g . , Bell , 1991 ; Winterhal - der & Smith , 1981 ) . Accordingly , people can de - cide to exploit a speciﬁc patch or to explore to ﬁnd a new patch with more rewards . For instance , when collecting berries one will ﬁrst harvest from a speciﬁc blackberry bush . After some time , most blackberries will be harvested and ﬁnding those remaining on that particular bush will be increas - ingly time intensive . At this point , the harvester has to make the decision whether to continue searching for blackberries on this bush or to look elsewhere—a decision that involves additional travel time and uncertainty about the quality of the next bush . Exploration – exploitation trade - offs in foraging have been investigated in many animals ( Blanchard , Wilke , & Hayden , 2014 ; Cuthill , Haccou , & Kacelnik , 1994 ; Louâpre , van Alphen , & Pierre , 2010 ) , including humans ( Fu & Gray , 2006 ; Hills , Todd , & Goldstone , 2010 ; Hutchin - son et al . , 2008 ; Wilke & Barrett , 2009 ; Wilke et al . , 2009 ) . Recently , computerized game - like tasks have been developed to help understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying humans’ explo - ration – exploitation decisions in such foraging scenarios , such as foraging for ﬁsh across ponds 153 FORAGING , SEARCH , OR EXPLORATION T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

( Hutchinson et al . , 2008 ; Mata , Wilke , & Czien - skowski , 2009 , 2013 ) . Repeated Choice Another class of paradigms frequently used to investigate how people trade off exploration and exploitation is the repeated choice or bandit task—a task that has raised considerable interest in understanding the cognitive and neural basis of such decisions in the past decade ( Cohen et al . , 2007 ; Daw , O’Doherty , Dayan , Seymour , & Dolan , 2006 ; Navarro , Newell , & Schulze , 2016 ; Steyvers , Lee , & Wagenmakers , 2009 ) . Bandit tasks typically ask people to repeatedly choose from a set of two or more options that differ in their expected reward while receiving probabilis - tic feedback from their choices . This requires trad - ing off exploration with exploitation : on the one hand , once people know which option provides the larger expected value they should exploit this option to maximize their payoff . On the other , exploiting too early involves the danger of choos - ing the wrong option . Furthermore , the quality of the options may change over time , which can be missed if only one option is exploited . Although most bandit tasks are structurally different from the foraging tasks discussed above , for example , in that they ask decision makers to repeatedly choose between the same options , bandit tasks can also be couched as foraging tasks in which indi - viduals are faced with the problem of learning about whether two or more patches differ in their mean quality ( cf . Rutledge et al . , 2009 ) . Sequential Choice Sequential choice paradigms also involve ex - ploration – exploitation trade - offs and have been studied extensively ( Bearden , Rapoport , & Mur - phy , 2006 ; Burns , Lee , & Vickers , 2006 ; Fergu - son , 1989 ; Gilbert & Mosteller , 1966 ; Miller & Todd , 1998 ; Seale & Rapoport , 1997 , 2000 ; von Helversen et al . , 2011 ; von Helversen & Mata , 2012 ) . When making decisions , it is not always possible to evaluate options simultaneously be - cause patches or options can be distributed in space and time , forcing the decision maker to sequentially search through each one until an ac - ceptable one is found . For instance , a person har - vesting fruit may need to consider at each fruit tree whether it is worth the effort of trying to reach the fruit , or to continue searching for a more accessi - ble tree . Furthermore , it is often not possible to return to a patch or option that has previously been rejected because , for instance , it has been ex - ploited by others . Exploration is necessary to re - duce the risk of settling for an inferior option because usually no ( or only imprecise ) informa - tion exists about the quality of the options that can be expected . Furthermore , the probability of at least encountering the best option increases with the amount of search . However , too much explo - ration can be dangerous because to continue ex - ploration may mean passing by ( and hence reject - ing ) the best option . The Present Study To our knowledge , there has been no previous attempt to assess whether individual differences in exploration generalize across different tasks in - volving exploration – exploitation trade - offs . We ﬁlled this gap by asking participants to complete three different tasks : A foraging task involving foraging for ﬁsh ( Hutchinson et al . , 2008 ) , a re - peated choice task in the form of a multiarmed bandit problem ( e . g . , Daw et al . , 2006 ) , and a sequential choice task as a version of the secretary task ( Seale & Rapoport , 1997 ) . Furthermore , par - ticipants completed two versions of each task to allow us to test the consistency of exploration preferences both across and within tasks , with the latter being a precondition for consistency across tasks . Method Design and Procedure Participants completed all three exploration – exploitation tasks . 1 Participants completed the task either on one day or within one week ( due to different class schedules ) . The order of the task was kept constant , starting with the ﬁshing task , followed by the bandit task , and the secretary task ( see Figure 1 ) . If participants completed the tasks in two sessions they would typically complete the ﬁshing task in the ﬁrst session and the other tasks in the second 1 In addition , we measured individual differences in cog - nitive abilities ( processing speed , working memory , and attention switching ) , risk - taking propensity , and a number of personality characteristics related to decision making to be used in an exploratory fashion .

To incentivize them , participants re - ceived course credit toward the research re - quirement of their PY151 introductory psychol - ogy class as well as the chance to win a $ 20 lottery for each of the three tasks . At the end of each semester a winner for the three lotteries was chosen . Participants We planned to acquire data from at least 200 participants to obtain enough power to conduct factorial analysis testing the correlations be - tween three latent variables corresponding to each of the three behavioral measures of explo - ration ( Kline , 2011 ) . To achieve our desired N , our sampling strategy consisted of recruiting participants across two full academic years ( 2010 / 2011 , 2011 / 2012 ) at Clarkson University , NY . Overall , a total of 303 participants were recruited to take part in the study . The study took on average 2 . 5 hr . Participants received course credit and entered a monetary lottery for each task . We excluded 42 of the 303 partici - pants because they failed to complete all mea - sures or their data could not be matched be - tween tasks . This resulted in a ﬁnal sample of 261 participants ( 124 men , mean age (cid:2) 19 years , SD (cid:2) 1 . 69 ) . In the ﬁshing task , we ad - ditionally excluded 36 participants : 28 because they experienced a different foraging environ - ment attributable to an experimenter mistake when setting up parameter ﬁles , and 8 because they missed a large number of ﬁsh ( (cid:3) 2 SD s ) in either one of the two task versions , indicating that they were not paying attention . The study was approved by Clarkson University’s Institu - tional Review Board ( IRB # 10 – 26 ) . All data are accessible on the open science framework ( https : / / osf . io / 4wf8r / ) . Materials Foraging : The ﬁshing task . The foraging task was a computerized ﬁshing task in which participants had to maximize the number of ﬁsh they could catch within 45 min ( Hutchinson et al . , 2008 ; Mata et al . , 2009 , 2013 ) . In the game , participants waited at a pond until a ﬁsh ap - peared at the surface ( for a screen shot see Figure 1A ) . Once a ﬁsh appeared they could catch it by clicking on it with the mouse cursor within 2 s . If they did not click on it , the ﬁsh disappeared again . The rate at which ﬁsh ap - peared at the surface of a pond was a stochastic function of the number of ﬁsh in the pond ( 0 . 005 (cid:4) ( number of ﬁsh in pond ) s (cid:5) 1 ) such that the fewer ﬁsh were left in a pond , the longer it took until the next ﬁsh appeared . At any point in time the participant could decide to leave the pond they were currently at and go to a new pond , but traveling to a new pond required time . The new pond was chosen randomly and its quality was unknown to the participant . Parti - cipants played two versions of the foraging task , a short and a long one . Whether participants started with the short or the long version was counterbalanced between participants . In the short version the traveling time between ponds was 15 s , in the long version the traveling time was 35 s . The number of ﬁsh in a new pond was drawn from a negative binomial distribution ( see Hutchinson et al . , 2008 for details ) . This distribution is characterized by a relatively low mean but a long tail , representing an environ - ment in which most patches will have few ﬁsh but a few have a large number . Speciﬁcally , 50 % of the ponds experienced by the partici - pants contained 10 ﬁsh or fewer , but 5 % con - tained 25 ﬁsh or more . Participants received $ 0 . 10 for each ﬁsh . Repeated choice : The bandit task . Each participant made choices from a ﬁve - armed bandit ( e . g . , Daw et al . , 2006 ) . Participants were presented with ﬁve abstract cues representing the different choice options and had to choose one cue in each trial ( see Figure 1B ) . Each arm had a stationary ( time - independent ) Bernoulli reward distribution function . All ﬁve arms were independent of each other . Choices were self - paced by participants . After each choice parti - cipants received feedback regarding the out - come of the chosen cue . Possible outcomes for each choice were $ 1 or $ 0 and the outcome was displayed for the selected cue only . The proba - bility of earning $ 1 varied across cues but re - mained stationary within a block , which was told to participants prior to playing the task . For the entire duration of the task , the number of remaining trials was shown on the screen to make time salient . Participants were told to maximize reward in the task , and that they could win 10 % of their total earnings . Participants completed four versions of the bandit task based on a 2 (cid:4) 2 factorial design . Each of the four versions was repeated twice resulting in a total of eight blocks of trials .

Short versions consisted of 25 trials , and long versions con - sisted of 75 trials . The expected payoffs for each of the arms were farther apart ( $ 0 . 30 , $ 0 . 40 , $ 0 . 50 , $ 0 . 60 , and $ 0 . 70 ) in the high variance versions and closer together ( $ 0 . 40 , $ 0 . 45 , $ 0 . 50 , $ 0 . 55 , and $ 0 . 60 ) in the low vari - ance versions . All participants played the eight blocks in the same order ( long high , short high , long low , short low , long high , short high , long low , short low ) . A different set of cues was used for each of the eight blocks . Sequential choice : The secretary task . As a sequential decision - making task participants completed a computerized secretary game ( Seale & Rapoport , 1997 ) . In the game partici - pants had to select the best secretary from a pool of applicants . Applicants were presented se - quentially in a random sequence . Participants did not receive direct information about the quality of an applicant , but only the relative rank of an applicant . The relative rank denotes how good an applicant is compared with the applicants the participant had seen so far in this trial . For each applicant participants had to de - cide whether they wanted to accept or reject the applicant ( for a screenshot see Figure 1C ) . If they rejected an applicant the next one would appear . If they accepted an applicant the trial was over and they received feedback about whether they had selected the best applicant or not . If participants did not accept an applicant before they reached the last one in the sequence , they had to select the last applicant . A rejected applicant could not be recalled at a later time . If participants selected the best applicant within one trial they received 10 points , otherwise they received 0 points in that trial . As before , parti - cipants played a short and a long version of the secretary game . As in the ﬁshing task , it was counterbalanced across participants whether participants started with the short or the long version of the task . In the short version the pool of applicants consisted of 20 applicants . In the long version the pool consisted of 40 applicants . Participants played 30 trials of each version . Results To investigate whether there was a task - general exploration factor we ﬁrst report measures of ex - ploration and their stability within the three tasks ( see Table 1 ) and then a structural equation mod - eling ( SEM ) approach to measure whether explo - ration shared variance across the tasks . SEM is a multivariate statistical technique that can be used to estimate and test models regarding latent con - structs and their relations to each other and mea - sured ( manifest ) variables ( for an introduction to SEM see Ullman & Bentler , 2012 ) . We followed a behavioral deﬁnition of ex - ploration as behavior that indicates a change in the option that is considered ( see also Mehlhorn et al . , 2015 ) . Accordingly , in the ﬁshing task we measured exploration with the number of ponds visited . In the multiarmed bandit task we used the proportion of choices that involved a switch between options as a measurement for explora - tion averaged across blocks . 2 In the secretary task we measured exploration by the mean pro - 2 Because the variance manipulation in the bandit task did not signiﬁcantly affect behavior , we aggregated exploration measures over the high and the low variance versions of the task .

In general , within each of the three tasks , the amount of exploration in the long and the short version of the tasks was highly related , suggest - ing that the exploration measures reﬂect stable individual differences in how much people ex - plore in the three tasks ( see Table 1 ) . If the degree of exploration is driven by a task - general factor exploration should also share variance across tasks . To explore this , we compared three different measurement models using AMOS ( version 20 ) , an SPSS software module for structural equation modeling , assuming that in each task exploration – exploitation measures of the short and the long version constitute a latent factor . An overview is presented in Table 2 . The ﬁrst measurement model would correspond to a completely task - speciﬁc model where all vari - ance in the trade - off between exploration and exploitation depends on the task . In contrast , the third measurement model corresponds to a com - pletely task - general model where exploration is completely determined by the same mechanism across all tasks . The second model presents a middle version that allows measuring the mag - nitude of variance that is shared between the tasks . Thus , high intercorrelations between the tasks would speak for a general exploration factor , whereas no or low intercorrelations would suggest that exploration is largely deter - mined by task - speciﬁc characteristics . We tested for deviations from normality and log - transformed the number of ponds visited in the ﬁshing task to achieve more normally dis - tributed values . In addition , we removed seven outliers with the largest Mahalanobis distance to reach multivariate normality ( descriptives are reported in Table S2 in the online appendix ) . 3 Models were ﬁtted using maximum likelihood estimation , estimating means and intercepts for the missing values in the ﬁshing task . For each model we report four common and recom - mended measures of goodness of ﬁt , the chi - square statistic , the root mean square error of approximation ( RMSEA ) , the comparative ﬁt index ( CFI ) to the independence model , and the Tucker Lewis index ( TLI ; see Table 2 ) . Usually a good ﬁt can be assumed if RMSEA (cid:6) . 06 , and CFI and TLI (cid:3) . 95 ( Schreiber , Nora , Stage , Bar - low , & King , 2006 ; Ullman & Bentler , 2012 ) . Overall , the second model ( see Figure 2 ) as - suming a three - factor latent variable model with correlated latent factors for each exploration task performed best . The model ﬁt indices indi - cated a good ﬁt to the data and the standardized 3 Outliers identiﬁed with the Mahalanobis distance largely overlapped with outliers identiﬁed via visual inspec - tion and the anomaly detection procedure implemented in SPSS . Including or excluding outliers does not change much the estimates for the standardized coefﬁcients for the paths between exploration in the bandit and the ﬁshing task and the bandit and the secretary task ( estimated coefﬁcients including all cases are (cid:5) . 13 and (cid:5) . 11 , respectively ) but it inﬂuences whether they reach signiﬁcance . Including all cases , all relations between tasks are nonsigniﬁcant . Exclud - ing further potential outliers the paths between the bandit and the ﬁshing task and the secretary task stay signiﬁcant .

Additional analyses focusing on exploration at the beginning and the end of the task as well as using computational models to extract pa - rameters measuring a participant’s level of ex - ploration show a similar picture of small nega - tive or nonsigniﬁcant relations between the tasks . We also investigated whether individual difference measures of risk preference were re - lated to exploration behavior , because previous research has suggested a relation between risk taking and exploration ( e . g . , Schunk & Winter , 2009 ) . We found small but signiﬁcant correla - tions between risk preference and exploration in the secretary task and the ﬁshing task , but tak - ing these into account did not change the rela - tion of exploration between the tasks . A more detailed report of all additional exploratory analyses can be found in the online appendix ( S1 – S4 ) on OSF ( https : / / osf . io / 4wf8r / ) . Discussion Humans and other animals encounter numer - ous trade - offs between exploration and exploi - tation in a range of different decision tasks . Recent research has suggested that exploration is guided by general tendencies ( e . g . , Sih & Del Giudice , 2012 ) and controlled by a domain - general mechanism ( e . g . , Hills et al . , 2010 , No . ponds Short No . ponds Long Prop . options searched Short Prop . options searched Long Prop . switches Short Prop . switches Long secretary bandit fishing . 83 . 97 . 89 . 75 . 98 . 97 . 01 - . 14 * e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6 Figure 2 .

Here , we investigated individual differences in explora - tion behavior across three research paradigms : a foraging task , a repeated decision task , and a sequential decision - making task . Although ex - ploration behavior was rather stable within ver - sions of each task , a psychometric analysis showed no common factor underlying explora - tion across tasks . If anything , the analysis sug - gested that more exploration in the bandit task may be related to less exploration in the ﬁshing task and less exploration in the secretary task . However , one should be cautious in the inter - pretation of these negative correlations because we found in exploratory analyses that they de - pend on excluding outliers ( not excluding out - liers leads to similar but nonsigniﬁcant negative correlations between the two tasks ) . Exploration in the secretary task was not related to explora - tion in the ﬁshing task . These results show little evidence for a general exploration factor and suggest that behavioral measures of exploration do not generalize across the three tasks we examined here . There are a number of possible explanations for our ﬁndings . First , it could be that domain - general preferences for exploration – exploita - tion do not exist or are trumped by strong do - main - speciﬁc expectations about the underlying statistic regularities of particular environments . For example , expectations concerning explora - tion when foraging for food may be consider - ably different than those for monetary rewards or job markets . Future work could likely proﬁt from understanding the statistical structure of past and present foraging environments and how different exploration – exploitation para - digms ( and cover stories ) elicit such represen - tations in decision makers today . Second , domain - general preferences may be further masked by individual differences in re - sponse to task - speciﬁc characteristics as a func - tion of their demands on speciﬁc abilities such as memory , time perception , and numerosity or numeracy . For example , the tasks we used dif - fered in a number of structural aspects including whether individuals chose between the same ( bandit ) or different options over time ( ﬁshing , secretary ) , or faced limits concerning time ( ﬁsh - ing ) or number of choices ( secretary , bandit ) . Similarly , the monetary payoffs of exploration versus exploitation differed between tasks and it is unclear how to equate them ( cf . Mehlhorn et al . , 2015 ) . Future work that varies such charac - teristics systematically in multiple paradigms could provide additional insights into the role of such characteristics and , more broadly , the pos - sibility of capturing general individual tenden - cies across different situations . Third , and perhaps more interestingly , it could be that general exploration tendencies operate at the level of goal disengagement from default or higher - level goals that are differen - tially relevant or prominent in the different tasks ( Hills et al . , 2010 ) . For example , in the ﬁshing task , the default behavior may be exploitation ( foraging within a pond ) , and the decision maker needs to switch to another behavior ( ex - ploring a new pond ) . In contrast , in the bandit and secretary tasks the default behavior may be exploration , with the decision maker having to make an active decision to stop exploring ( see also Mehlhorn et al . , 2015 ) . Individual differ - ences in goal setting or cognitive control abili - ties in engaging / disengaging from default goals , rather than exploration per se , could perhaps help explain the negative relation found be - tween exploration the bandit task and the ﬁshing task ( e . g . , Hills , 2011 ; Mata & von Helversen , 2015 ) . One possible avenue for future work that evaluates the role of goals could involve ma - nipulating goals directly , for example , through task instructions ( cf . Mata et al . , 2009 ) . In sum , our research found no general explo - ration tendency across three different tasks commonly used to study exploration – exploita - tion trade - offs . Our ﬁndings point out the need to understand how particular domains , task characteristics , or goals lead to differential ex - ploration in various foraging - like situations .
