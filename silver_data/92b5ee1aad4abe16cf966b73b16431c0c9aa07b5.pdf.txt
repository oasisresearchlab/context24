Yeates 4 , 6 , 7 & David Baker 1 , 2 , 8 The self - assembly of proteins into highly ordered nanoscale architectures is a hallmarkof biological systems . The sophis - ticated functions of these molecular machines have inspired the development of methods to engineer self - assembling protein nanostructures ; however , the design of multi - component protein nanomaterials with high accuracy remains an outstanding challenge . Here we report a computational method for designing protein nanomaterials in which multiple copies of two distinct subunits co - assemble into a specific architecture . We use the method to design five 24 - subunit cage - like protein nanomaterials in two distinct symmetric architectures and experimentally demonstrate that their structures are in close agreement with the computational design models . The accuracy of the method and the number and variety of two - component materials that it makes accessible suggest a route to the construction of functional protein nanomaterials tailored to specific applications . The unique functional opportunities afforded by protein self - assembly range from the dynamic cellular scaffolding provided by cytoskeletal proteins to the encapsulation , protection and delivery of viral genomes to new host cells by virus capsids . Although natural assemblies can be repurposed to perform new functions 1 , 2 , this strategy is limited to the structuresofexistingproteins , whichmaynotbesuitedtoagivenappli - cation . To overcome this limitation , methods for designing novel self - assemblingproteinsareofconsiderableinterest 3 – 6 . Thecentralchallenge indesigningself - assembling proteinsistoencodetheinformationnec - essarytodirectassemblyinthestructuresoftheproteinbuildingblocks . Althoughthecomplexityand irregularityofproteinstructuresresulted in slow initial progress in this area , advances in computational protein designalgorithmsand newapproaches such as metal - mediatedassem - blyhaverecentlyyieldedexcitingresults 6 – 16 . Despitetheseadvances , the self - assembling protein structures designed so far have been relatively simple , and continuedimprovementsindesignstrategiesareneededin order to enable the practical design of functional materials . The level of structural complexity available to self - assembled nano - materialsgenerallyincreaseswiththenumberofuniquemolecularcom - ponents used to construct the material . This is illustrated by DNA nanotechnology , inwhichspecificanddirectionalinteractionsbetween hundreds of distinct DNA strands allow the construction of nanoscale objects with essentially arbitrary structures 17 – 20 . In contrast , designing well - ordered multi - component protein nanomaterials has remained a significantchallenge . Multipledistinctintermolecularcontactsarenec - essarytodrivetheassemblyofsuchmaterials 3 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 21 , andprogramming new , geometrically precise interactions between proteins is difficult . Compared to homo - oligomers , multi - component protein nanomater - ials offer several advantages : a wider range of possible structures due to theirconstructionfromcombinationsofbuildingblocks , greatercontrol over the timing of assembly , and enhanced modularity through inde - pendently addressable subunits . Although multi - component protein assemblieshaverecentlybeengeneratedusingdisulphidebonds 14 , 22 , flex - ible genetic linkers 11 , 15 , 22 , or stereotyped coiled - coil interactions to drive assembly 14 , 15 , the flexibility of these relatively minimal linkages has generally resulted in materials that are somewhat polydisperse . Most natural protein assemblies , on the other hand , are constructed from protein – protein interfaces involving many contacts distributed over large interaction surfaces that serve to precisely define the positions of the subunits relative to each other 23 , 24 . Advances in computational protein modelling and design algorithms have recently made it pos - sible to design such interfaces 25 – 29 and thereby direct the formation of novel self - assembling protein nanomaterials with atomic - level accu - racy 7 , 9 , 10 , but the methods reported so far have been limited to the design of materials comprising only a single type of molec - ular building block . Here we expandthe structuralandfunctionalrange ofdesignedprotein materialswith a generalcomputationalmethodfor designing two - component co - assembling protein nanomaterials with high accuracy . Computational design method Our method centres on encoding the information necessary to direct assembly in designed protein – protein interfaces . In addition to pro - viding theenergetic driving force for assembly , the designed interfaces also precisely define the relative orientations of the building blocks . We illustrate the method in Fig . 1 using the dual tetrahedral architec - ture ( designated here as T33 ) as an example . In this architecture , four copieseachoftwodistinct , naturallytrimericbuildingblocksarealigned atoppositepolesofthethree - foldsymmetryaxesofatetrahedron ( Fig . 1a ) . This places one set of building blocks at the vertices of the tetrahedron and the other at the centres of the faces , totalling 12 subunits of each protein . Each trimeric building block is allowed to rotate around and translate along its three - fold symmetry axis ( Fig . 1b ) ; other rigid body movesaredisallowedbecausetheywouldleadtoasymmetry .

Polyacrylamide gel elec - trophoresis ( PAGE ) underdenaturingandnon - denaturing ( native ) con - ditions was used to rapidly assess the level of soluble expression and assemblystateofthedesignedproteinsinclarifiedcelllysates . Formost of the designs , either one or both of the designed proteins was not de - tectable in the soluble fraction , suggesting that insoluble expression is a common failure mode for the designed materials . Given that the majorityof themutationsintroducedby ourmethodare changes from polartohydrophobicresiduesatthedesignedinterfaces , itislikelythat theinsolubilityofthesedesignsisduetoeithermisfoldingornon - specific aggregationof thedesigned proteinsubunits . Nevertheless , several de - signed protein pairs yielded single bands under non - denaturing con - ditions that migrated more slowly than the wild - type proteins from which they were derived , suggesting assembly to higher - order species ( Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . These proteins were subcloned to introduce a hexahistidine tag at the carboxy terminus of one of the two subunits andpurifiedbynickelaffinitychromatographyandsizeexclusionchro - matography ( SEC ) . Five pairs of designed proteins—one T32 design ( T32 - 28 ) andfourT33designs ( T33 - 09 , T33 - 15 , T33 - 21andT33 - 28 ) — eluted together during nickel affinity chromatography and yielded dominantpeaksattheexpectedsizeofapproximately24subunitswhenanalysedbySEC ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Table 1 ) . We tested the ability of each of the five materials to assemble in vitro by expressing the two components in separate E . coli cultures and mix - ing them at various points after cell lysis ( Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . Native PAGE revealed that in two cases ( T33 - 15 and T32 - 28 ) the two sepa - rately expressed componentsefficiently assembledto give the designed materials invitro whenequalvolumesofcelllysatesweremixed ( Fig . 2b , Extended Data Fig . 3a , c ) . Adjusting the volume of each lysate in the mixture to account for differences in the level of soluble expression of thetwocomponentsallowedformorequantitativeassembly . Inthecase of T33 - 15 , the two components of the material could also be purified independently : T33 - 15A and T33 - 15B each eluted from the SEC col - umnas trimersin isolation . Aftermixingthetwopurifiedcomponents in a 1 : 1 molar ratio and allowing a two - hour incubation at room tem - perature , the mixture eluted from the SEC column predominantly at the volume expected for the 24 - subunit assembly , with small amounts of residual trimeric building blocks remaining ( Fig . 2a ) . It is thus pos - sible to control the assembly of our designed materials by simply mix - ing the two independently produced components . The details of the designed interfaces for the five materials , high - lightingtheshapeandchemicalcomplementaritygeneratedbythemanyaminoacidmutationsintroducedduringdesign , arepresentedinFig . 3 . Qualitatively , theinterfacesreflectthehypothesisunderlyingthedesign protocol : they feature well - packed and highly complementary cores of hydrophobicsidechainsresidingmostlyinelementsofsecondarystruc - ture , surrounded by polar side chains lining the periphery of the hydro - phobic cores . The successful designs are quantitatively similar to the other designs according to the interface metrics used to select designs forexperimentalcharacterization ( predictedbindingenergy , shapecom - plementarity , interfacesizeandnumberofburiedunsatisfied hydrogen - bonding groups ; Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . The similarity of the successful andunsuccessfuldesignsaccordingtothesestructuralmetrics , combined with the observed insolubility of many of the designs , suggests that focusing on improving the level of soluble expression of the designed proteins could substantially improve the success rate of our approach in the future . Structural characterization of the designed materials Negative - stain electron microscopy of the five designed materials con - firmedthatthey assemble specificallytothetargetarchitectures ( Fig . 4 ) . For each material , fields of monodisperse particles of the expected size andsymmetrywereobserved , confirmingthehomogeneityofthemate - rials suggested by SEC . Particle averaging yielded images that recapitu - latefeatures of the computational design models at low resolution . For example , class averages of T33 - 09 revealed roughly square or triangle - shapedstructureswithwell - definedinternalcavitiesthatcloselyresem - ble projections calculated from the computational design model along itstwo - foldandthree - foldaxes ( Fig . 4b , inset ) . MicrographsofT33 - 15 assembled in vitro as described above were indistinguishable from those of co - expressed T33 - 15 ( Fig . 4c , f and Extended Data Fig . 5c ) , demonstrating that the same material is obtained using both methods . We solved X - ray crystal structures of four of the designed materials ( T32 - 28 , T33 - 15 , T33 - 21 and T33 - 28 ) to resolutions ranging from 2 . 1 to 4 . 5A˚ ( Fig . 5 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ) .

Discussion Owing to the unique functions accessible to self - assembling proteins , thereisintense interest inengineeringprotein nanomaterialsforappli - cations in various fields . Most efforts so far have focused on repurpos - ing naturally occurring protein assemblies , a strategy that is ultimately limitedbythestructuresavailableandtheirtolerancesformodification . Similarly , although directed evolution is a powerful method for protein engineering 34 , 35 andcanbeusedtoimprove , forexample , thepackaging capability of existing protein nanocontainers 36 , 37 , it is difficult to envi - sion how it could accurately generate new protein nanomaterials with target structures defined at the atomic level . Our results demonstrate that computationalprotein design provides a general route for design - ing novel two - component self - assembling protein nanomaterials with high accuracy .

All rights reserved ©2014 Extended Data Figure 1 | Comparison of one - component and multi - component symmetric fold trees . Within the Rosetta macromolecular modelling suite , the connections between residues in a protein structure are represented as a directed , acyclic , graph referred to as a ‘fold tree’ 32 , 38 . When modelling multiple subunits in symmetric systems , the rigid body orientations of the subunits can be controlled by modifying the appropriate connections in the fold tree . In this work , we have extended Rosetta to allow multiple , independently managed connections from the fold tree to the subunits in the asymmetric unit ( ASU ) of the modelled structure . To demonstrate the new behaviour enabled by this change , three different symmetric fold tree representations of a D32 architecture are shown . In this architecture , which is used because of its relative simplicity , two trimeric building blocks ( wheat ) are aligned along the three - fold rotational axes of D3 point - group symmetry and three dimeric building blocks ( light blue ) are aligned along the two - fold rotational axes . a , The dimer - centric one - component symmetry case . Rigid - body degree of freedom ( RB DOF , black lines ) J D3 connecting the dimer subunittothetrimersubunitintheASUisdownstreamofRBDOFsJ D1 andJ D2 controllingthedimersubunit ; inthis case thepositionsofthetrimericsubunits depend on the positions of the dimeric subunits . b , The trimer - centric one - component symmetry case . RB DOF J T3 connecting the trimer subunit to the dimer subunit in the ASU is downstream of RB DOFs J T1 and J T2 controlling the trimer subunit ; in this case the positions of the dimeric subunits depend on the positions of the trimeric subunits . c , The multi - component symmetry case . With multi - component symmetric modelling , the RB DOFs controlling the trimer subunit ( J T1 andJ T2 ) andthedimersubunit ( J D1 andJ D2 ) in theASUare independent . In this case the positions of the dimeric subunits do not depend on the positions of the trimeric subunits and vice versa , allowing the internal DOFs for each building block ( J T2 and J D2 ) to be maintained while moving the building blocks independently ( J T1 and J D1 ) .
