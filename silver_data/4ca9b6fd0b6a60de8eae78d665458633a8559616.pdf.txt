In SMLM , single fluorophore labels are made to repeatedly switch on and off ( “ blink ” ) , and their exact locations are determined by mathematically finding the centers of individual blinks . The image quality obtainable by SMLM critically depends on efficacy of blinking ( brightness , fraction of molecules in the on - state ) and on preparation longevity and labeling density . Recent work has identified several combinations of bright dyes and imaging buffers that work well together . Unfortunately , dif - ferent dyes blink optimally in different imaging buffers , and acquisition of good quality 2 - and 3 - color images has therefore remained challenging . In this study we describe a new imaging buffer , OxEA , that supports 3 - color imaging of the popular Alexa dyes . We also describe incremental improvements in preparation technique that significantly decrease lateral - and axial drift , as well as increase preparation longevity . We show that these improvements allow us to collect very large series of images from the same cell , enabling image stitching , extended 3D imaging as well as multi - color recording . Introduction When viewed by conventional fluorescence light microscopy even the smallest details in a cell will be visualized as little blurry ' blobs ' of light due to light diffraction . Consequently , closely spaced cellular details cannot be resolved individually because the fluorescence blobs ( approxi - mately 250 nm in X and Y , and approximately 650 nm in Z ) overlap in the image . Localiza - tion - based super resolution microscopy methods ( STORM , GSDIM , PALM and variants thereof ) circumvent this diffraction barrier by ensuring that at any moment in time the major - ity of fluorophores are in a dark off - state while only a few clearly separable fluorophores are in the bright on - state . By finding the center of all these fluorescent blobs ( which are termed PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 July 8 , 2016 1 / 18 a11111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Nahidiazar L , Agronskaia AV , Broertjes J , van den Broek B , Jalink K ( 2016 ) Optimizing Imaging Conditions for Demanding Multi - Color Super Resolution Localization Microscopy .

' events ' or ' blinks ' ) in many thousands of sequential images , the molecules can be localized much more precisely , resulting in up to 10 - fold improved resolution . Localization microscopy is therefore rapidly gaining popularity for the study of the ultrastructure of cells . It can be implemented with relatively simple instrumentation : a good fluorescence microscope with excellent stability ( i . e . , extremely low mechanical drift over time ) , a sensitive EM - CCD or CMOS digital camera and powerful lasers for excitation are the main ingredients . In GSDIM and dSTORM microscopy , cells are typically labeled densely with synthetic fluo - rescent labels , either through conjugation to ( secondary ) antibodies for immunolabeling , or to specific marker molecules such as phalloidin , which labels actin filaments . Imaging starts with all molecules in the on - state . Using very intense excitation ( laser power typically 50 – 150 mW at the preparation ) the majority of fluorophores is rapidly pushed in the dark state , allowing for the precise localization of the few remaining molecules by software fitting . Clearly , fluorophore blinking ( switching between the on - and off - state ) is the vital charac - teristic that defines a good super resolution ( SR ) dye . In the on - state , fluorescent dyes are rap - idly and repeatedly excited to the excited singlet state ( see Fig 1 ) and , after a few nanoseconds they return to the ground state by emission of red - shifted photons that are detected by the camera . A small fraction of molecules , about 0 . 1 % , may enter a relatively long - lived ( μ s to ms ) non - fluorescent triplet - state . Triplet - state molecules are dark , but eventually return to the ground state and re - enter the normal fluorescence cycle . Not only does the triplet state Fig 1 . Minimal Jablonski diagram of fluorophore blinking . Simplified Jablonski diagram showing molecular states essential to STORM / GSDIM . For simplicity , neither vibrational levels nor possible additional dark states have been indicated . In the bright On - state , fluorophores can be excited ( Ex ) from the ground state ( S 0 ) to the excited singlet state ( S 1 ) . From there , they may either relax to the ground state by emitting a quantum of light ( h ν ) or alternatively , they may undergo intersystem crossing to the dark triplet state ( T 1 ) . From the triplet state , molecules may return to the ground state or progress to a second , long - lived dark state ( D ) , e . g . through redox reactions . Direct transfer from the excited singlet state to the dark state has also been reported [ 2 ] ( dashed arrow ) . Molecules in the dark state may return to the ground state by inverse redox reactions , or alternatively , by exposure to near - UV radiation ( back - pumping ) . S 0 and S 1 are called On - states , while T 1 and D are Off - states . With most molecules in the Off state , it is possible to detect the few remaining bright fluorophores individually in the preparation . Dark states may last between milliseconds and minutes , whereas triplet states may last microseconds at ambient oxygen levels . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 . g001 Optimizing Super Resolution Imaging PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 July 8 , 2016 2 / 18 Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist .

Dark states may also be evoked by other mechanisms including rapid and reversible chemical modifications like redox - reactions with oxidants or reductants that are present in the imaging buffer ( redox blinking ) [ 1 ] . Fluorophore blinking has been studied intensely in recent years [ 1 – 7 ] and only a minor fraction of fluorophores tested blink well - enough for efficient SR imaging . A good SR dye : 1 . should have high absorption coefficient and quantum yield to produce bright events , because the achievable localization precision scales with the square root of the number of detected photons in the blink event . 2 . The On - time should be long enough to allow collection of a large number of photons , but not too long because that slows down the data acquisition process . 3 . The dye should have a completely dark Off - state that is long enough to prevent too many fluorophores to be on at the same time , so as to prevent high background and degradation of S / N . 4 . Finally , since in particular 3D imaging requires collection of tens of thousands of images at high laser power , the dye should be exceptionally resistant to bleaching . Bleaching , bright - ness , on - time and On / Off duty cycle are all strongly affected by laser power and buffer composition . Among the best SR dyes are cyanine derivatives ( Cy2 , Cy3 , Cy5 and in particular Alexa Fluor 647 ) and rhodamines ( Alexa Fluor 488 , Atto 488 , Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 568 ) [ 8 ] . Unfortunately , these dyes often have widely different requirements for buffer composition . For example , whereas cyanines work optimally in oxygen - free buffers ( i . e . , they show very little bleaching and display very bright , brief blinks ) , rhodamines really don ’ t blink properly in the absence of oxygen [ 8 ] . This severely limits our choices for multi - color imaging . Composition and working mechanisms of imaging buffers have been studied recently [ 1 ] . In particular , the concentration of oxygen ( O 2 ) in the buffers appears somewhat of a double - edged sword . On the one hand , oxygen radicals are responsible for dye bleaching , and therefore O 2 removal dramatically increases the longevity of the preparation . Therefore , buffers suitable for cyanine dyes typically contain a scavenger system to effectively remove oxygen [ 1 , 3 ] . On the other hand , however , O 2 is a major triplet state quencher , that is , the large fraction of fluor - ophores that ends up in the ( dark ) triplet state under intense illumination is effectively quenched ( brought back to the fluorescent state ) by atmospheric O 2 levels within microsec - onds . In the absence of O 2 , triplet states may exist for many seconds , strongly reducing the photon flux as well as causing unfavorable blinking behavior [ 3 ] . Addition of reducing agents ( like MEA , or β - MercaptoEthylamine ) at millimolar concentrations may mitigate those disad - vantages to some extent by replacing O 2 as triplet state quenchers , thus restoring high count rate and blinking behavior of the fluorophores . MEA also controls redox - blinking of the dyes , and thus is pivotal in controlling the second ( chemical ) long - lived dark state ( see Fig 1 ) . To control preparation oxygen levels , several roads have been taken . Embedding in solidify - ing media such as Poly Vinyl Alcohol ( PVA ) [ 9 ] , embedding resin [ 10 ] , or VectaShield [ 11 ] is effective , but it may limit the attainable resolution by e . g . fixing the dipole orientation of fluoro - phores , causing errors of up to 125nm [ 12 ] . Embedding also limits the access of blink - support - ing reagents like MEA . For that reason , the highest quality images are still acquired in buffer solutions . The most popular buffer system " Gloxy " uses Glucose - oxidase to consume oxygen in the enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic acid . The byproduct of this reaction , hydrogen Optimizing Super Resolution Imaging PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 July 8 , 2016 3 / 18 peroxide , must be removed with catalase because of its adverse effects on fluorophores [ 13 ] [ 8 ] . In addition , the production of gluconic acid due to ongoing influx of O 2 in the preparation causes a steady drop in pH ( about 2 pH / hours , in our hands ) that severely diminishes fluoro - phore brightness within an hour [ 14 ] . This is particularly unfortunate since after mounting , it typically takes up to 20 minutes for the preparation to reach maximal mechanical stability . Acquisition of very large image sets ( 3D images or large overview - images constituted by stitch - ing of several sub - images ) may take up to several hours and is not practical in open dishes . Acidification may be partly remedied by sealing the preparation , for example with the two compound silicone glue Twinsil ( Picodent , Wipperfürth , Germany , # 13001000 ) or nail polish [ 15 ] . This extends longevity of the preparation to several hours , but eventually the preparations still deteriorate . Long - term storage of such sealed preparations is therefore not feasible because the low pH decreases sample quality in time even without imaging [ 16 ] . In view of the above , we concluded that current buffer systems are not optimal for multi - color imaging and they restrict longevity of the preparation . We therefore set out to improve the preparation for prolonged multi - color imaging . In this study , we describe in detail the com - position and properties of a new oxygen scavenger system , OxEA , that we recently used for 3 - color SR imaging [ 17 ] . Here we present a full characterization of OxEA , showing that it does not acidify and that it supports good quality dual - and triple color imaging . We also scrutinized image chamber performance and present a new implementation , based on specially made low - drift glass - bottom chambers from WillCo Wells that can be sealed in an easy and effective way to prevent oxygen influx . With these improvements , we were able to collect good images from a single preparation for several months . We collected an almost unlimited amount of blinking events from the same preparation and even from a single cell , enabling image stitching , extended 3D imaging as well as multi - color recording . Results and Discussion Part I : OxEA , a new multi - color imaging buffer In search of a good imaging buffer that support multicolor imaging , we looked in the available literature for oxygen scavenger systems that deplete O 2 significantly yet do not acidify the medium upon consuming O 2 . Of several different scavengers tested , we obtained best results with Oxyrase , a deoxygenating reagent made of a sterile , oxygen consuming membrane frac - tion of Escherichia coli and DL - lactate added as a substrate [ 18 ] . Note that DL - lactate also has antioxidant and radical scavenger properties itself [ 19 ] . To prepare an imaging buffer , the Oxy - rase preparation ( 3 % V / V , see Methods ) and DL - lactate ( 100 μ M ) were dissolved in phos - phate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , to which further the triplet state quencher MEA ( 50 mM ) was added . The final buffer , which we termed OxEA ( Oxyrase / β - MercaptoEthylAmine ) was adjusted to pH 8 . 0 – 8 . 5 ( precise value not important ) with NaOH . We observed that OxEA supports blinking of Alexa - 647 for many hours , yielding very high quality SR images ( Fig 2 ) . The image in Fig 2A was acquired 2 hours after mounting of the preparation ; for comparison , after two hours in an open dish with Gloxy buffer , many of the fine details in SR images were lost ( Fig 2B ) . Strikingly , unlike Gloxy buffer , OxEA also appeared to support blinking of additional color channels within the same preparation ( Fig 2C ) . We therefore set out to characterize OxEA in further detail . Stable pH and oxygen levels in OxEA Fig 3 shows that the pH in an open ( uncovered ) microscopy dish filled with 0 . 5 ml of Gloxy buffer shows a steady drop at a rate of up to 2 pH units per hour . Since dye brightness and blinking characteristics deteriorate accordingly [ 14 ] , this effectively limited the time slot for Optimizing Super Resolution Imaging PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 July 8 , 2016 4 / 18 Fig 2 .

In con - trast , the pH detected in OxEA buffer proofed constant , even after several days had passed . Next , we compared the oxygen scavenging properties of OxEA to those of Gloxy buffer . Using a fluorescence lifetime - based O 2 meter , we recorded oxygen levels in an open dish with PBS continuously at 1 Hz ( Fig 4 ) . Addition of Gloxy buffer caused an immediate ( i . e . , within 20 s ) drop in O 2 levels towards zero , with no detectable free oxygen remaining . Oxygen levels remained below detection limits until the Gloxy buffer ran out , typically after 1 – 1 . 5 hours . In contrast , addition of OxEA to the buffer caused a much slower drop in O 2 levels ( Fig 4 ) . Fur - thermore , OxEA failed to completely deplete O 2 , with some detectable O 2 remaining ( 1 – 2 % ; Fig 4 ) . We therefore hypothesized that OxEA depletes oxygen sufficiently to cause intense blinking of Alexa - 647 , while the remaining low ( but non - zero ) levels of oxygen permit efficient blinking in Rhodamine dyes like Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 555 . Indeed , blinking of Rhodamine dyes ( both intensity and number of events above threshold per frame ) in OxEA buffer Fig 3 . pH in OxEA and Gloxy buffer . The pH in open dishes filled with 0 . 5 ml of OxEA ( red squares ) or Gloxy buffer ( blue circles ) is graphed at the indicated time points . Note the steep drop in pH in Gloxy buffer , which limits imaging to ~ 1 hour unless measures are taken to prevent oxygen influx . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 . g003 Fig 4 . Oxygen levels in OxEA and Gloxy buffers . O 2 levels were detected every two seconds using a FireSting fluorescence - lifetime based oxygen detector . Note that addition of Gloxy buffer ( blue ) causes a rapid drop in O 2 level to undetectable levels , whereas OxEA caused a more slow and less complete removal of O 2 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 . g004 Optimizing Super Resolution Imaging PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 July 8 , 2016 6 / 18 deteriorated markedly when Gloxy buffer was added from a concentrated stock ( average inten - sity 2156 + / - 312 photons / blink in OxEA , versus 371 + / - 99 after adding Gloxy to the dish for Alexa - 488 ) . This indicates that incomplete oxygen depletion , rather than one of the other com - ponents in OxEA , is supporting the blinking of Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 555 in these experiments . Comparison of blinking and image quality in OxEA and Gloxy buffer For a more quantitative comparison of blinking , we compared cell preparations labeled with different fluorophores in OxEA and Gloxy buffer . RF EC24 endothelial cells were labeled for vimentin using a mouse monoclonal antibody ( Ab ) and secondary Ab labeled with Alexa dyes . Series of 50 , 000 frames or more were collected in TIRF mode at 100 fps , and we calculated blink intensity , blink duration and the number of blinks per frame as a function of imaging time . Fig 5 shows representative data as well as summary statistics . Our data can be summa - rized as follows . First , whereas in Gloxy buffer excitation with the 647 laser depleted the ground state of Alexa - 647 in about 10 s and caused very bright blinking for prolonged times ( Fig 5A , Gloxy buffer , lower strip ) , in this buffer other dyes including Alexa - 488 proved much harder to pump to the dark state and blinks were much less bright and defined . The latter is likely due to a con - spicuous background that may be attributed to poor ground state depletion ( Fig 5A ) . A similar observation was made for Alexa - 555 ( Fig 5A ) . In OxEA buffer , Alexa - 647 performed fine in that it was quickly pumped to the dark state ( Fig 5A ) and blinked well for a prolonged time , although the blink intensity was somewhat diminished ( Fig 5B ) as compared to Gloxy . In con - trast to Gloxy buffer , excitation in OxEA readily depleted the ground state of Alexa - 555and Alexa - 488 ( Fig 5A ) , resulting in images with considerably less background . Blink intensity of Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 555 also proved higher in OxEA buffer ( Fig 5B ) resulting in superior images ( Fig 2 ) . Second , in Gloxy buffer the number of events per frame typically drops to unpractically low levels after about 10 to 20 thousand frames ( Fig 5C ) , whereas in OxEA typically a higher blink count is observed at least up to 50 , 000 frames . This is especially important for collection of 3D images because these require much more frames for a complete reconstruction . In STORM / GSDIM , back - pumping with a 405 nm laser has been commonly used to partially compensate for ongoing run - down of blink rates . In none of the experiments included in this report back - pumping was applied ; however , it is important to note that 405 - nm back - pumping worked approximately equally effective on blinking rates in OxEA and Gloxy buffers . Third , whereas Gloxy buffer is best used fresh and deteriorates noticeably already after 30 – 45 minutes ( Fig 5D ; note that this is particularly apparent in the Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 555 channels ) , OxEA supports good blinking for at least four hours in open dishes . This makes it much more convenient to record several images from the same sample . We noted that in age - ing Gloxy buffer , individual events became much less bright . Even more importantly , fluoro - phore on - time changed significantly , showing both an increased mean on - time as well as a dramatic increase in variability due to emergence of a population of blinks that spanned many ( > 10 ) frames ( Fig 5E ) . Fourth , it is noteworthy that OxEA also supports good blinking of labels that have not been used very successfully in GSDIM / STORM imaging , such as FITC ( Fig 5B ) . This is important because it enables selecting from the large collection of ( primary ) antibodies that have been labeled with this popular dye over the years . We also assessed other properties that could potentially deteriorate final image quality in OxEA , when compared to ( fresh ) Gloxy . Apart from a slight decrease in localization precision for Alexa - 647 ( due to lower photon count ; compare Fig 5B ) , we identified no factors that could Optimizing Super Resolution Imaging PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 July 8 , 2016 7 / 18 Fig 5 .

In summary , the combination of fresh Gloxy buffer and Alexa - 647 still provides the highest possible localization precision , but OxEA appears to be a superior buffer for low - background multi - color recording and when preparation longevity is important . The 3 - color image pre - sented in Fig 2 demonstrates the fine quality of 3 - color images that can be routinely obtained with OxEA buffer . Part II : Keeping oxygen out : a simple and stable oxygen - tight chamber In the above , open dishes exposed to ambient air have been compared for the two buffer sys - tems . Several reports have shown that the longevity of Gloxy buffer preparations can be signifi - cantly increased by covering and sealing the preparation , which is particularly important with cyanine dyes . Preventing oxygen influx abolishes acidification and peroxide production and therefore averts the main shortcomings of Gloxy buffers , at least for single - color imaging . In testing these solutions we noted that indeed , sealing the preparation with two - component com - pounds like Twinsil can increase preparation lifespan to 4 – 24 hours although eventually , the quality of the images still deteriorates . Furthermore , sealing often significantly increased prepa - ration drift . This is probably due to differences in expansion coefficient between the aqueous buffer and the glass coverslips , which causes small temperature differences to generate stress on the coverslip . Indeed , a night in the refrigerator is often enough to draw small air bubbles in sealed preparations . We therefore next addressed drift and sealing of the recording chambers . WillCo Well # GWSB - 3512 - N : a dedicated low - drift SR glass bottom dish Drift was characterized in detail using glass surfaces with sparse sub - resolution fluorescent beads immobilized to them , by imaging for extended time at low power excitation on our Leica SR - GSD microscope . The microscope is located in a separate air - conditioned room with tem - perature stability of + / - 1 degree C . X , Y and Z position were detected to nm precision in 3D - acquisition mode ( see Methods ) . The drift of the microscope SuMo stage itself appeared 1 . 3 + / - 0 . 7 nm / min in X / Y and less than 1 . 6 + / - 1 . 1 nm / min in 3D ( X , Y and Z combined ) after allow - ing an initial settling time of 15 min ( Fig 6B ) . Maximum excursion from the starting point observed over a 2 - hour period was 35 nm in 3 dimensions . In contrast , over a period of 30 min , various glass bottom dishes from commercial sources showed drift of up to 700 nm in X / Y and 1 . 2 μ m in Z , often rendering the data of 3 - D stacks completely useless . We tested single - well chambers as well as 8 - well slides . Although not systematically quantified , sealing with Twinsil appeared to further deteriorate preparation stability . Glass - to - plastic bonding may be suspected to be a prime source of drift due to differences in thermal expansion coefficients , but also because curing of the bonding material generates preparation labeled with Alexa - 488 and imaged in Gloxy or OxEA . Similar parts of cells with similar initial labeling density were selected based on the low - intensity wide - field image . Note the much larger number of blinks in OxEA for Alexa - 488 .

Increased blink duration adds to the appearance of structured background . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 . g005 Optimizing Super Resolution Imaging PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 July 8 , 2016 9 / 18 visible stress ( bending ) of the coverslip . In response to our observations WillCo Wells , a lead - ing producer of microscopy glass - bottom dishes for in - vitro fertilization purposes , developed alternative curing protocols for the adhesive which resulted in significantly diminished bending of the glass coverslips . We found that type GWSB - 3512 - N WillCo Wells perform extremely well in drift tests ( Fig 6 ) , drifting on average only 2 . 1 nm / min in XY and 8 nm / min in X , Y and Z . This represents an improvement of at least 4 - fold ( and often much more ) over other com - mercial dishes tested in our lab . We conclude that glass - to - dish bonding is extremely important to avoid preparation drift and suggest WillCo Wells GWSB - 3512 - N as a good commercial source of low - drift dishes . Finally , we also tested several cover slip mounting rings for drift . Best results were obtained with reusable Live Cell Instruments magnetic coverslip mounts ( Fig 6B ) . Much more drift was observed with screw - on type rings , probably because they do put more strain on the cover slip . Importantly , any slight residual drift observed in the optimized preparations could be easily corrected for in software , either through inclusion of fiducial markers or through the piece - wise image correlation algorithm present in ThunderSTORM software .

Significant improvements were obtained when the cover glass was sealed using e . g . vacuum grease , parafilm [ 20 ] or with Twinsil , a two - component elastic adhe - sive [ 15 ] . This increased longevity of the preparations several fold , but eventually ( within hours or days ) preparations still run down . Strikingly , when tested with the fluorescence lifetime O 2 logger , we observed that Twinsil is quite permeable to O 2 ( Fig 7A and 7B ) . We therefore tested a range of fast - curing adhesives including UV - curable glass glue , nail varnish , and various vari - eties of epoxy glue and silicone kit . None of these were completely effective in blocking O 2 influx . In addition , like with Twinsil , application of these sealants frequently caused additional drift . In industrial process technology , adhesive - backed aluminum metal foil is successfully used to seal sutures and prevent gas exchange . In O 2 - lifetime experiments , this material proved fully impermeable to oxygen ( Fig 7B ) . Indeed , it proved easy to completely seal WillCo Wells as well as other containers ( Fig 7C ) and such preparations retained very low O 2 levels for periods of up to several months . This oxygen - tight chamber ( OTC ) preparation allows recording of exceptionally long series of frames from a single cell . For example , the image in Fig 8A is stitched from 8 individual SR images , each collected with > 20 , 000 frames . In S1 Movie we provide a zoom - in on the last Fig 7 .

Note the rapid drop in O 2 levels below the Twinsil seal , indicating its permeability to oxygen .

In Fig 8B we present a 3D stack consisting of 15 images that required a total or 300 , 000 frames to be collected from the same area of the cell . The total collection time in this experiment was ~ 1 . 5 hours . To push repeated imaging to the limit , we tested collection of 1 , 5000 , 000 frames in a single 180x180 pixel image . This still did not terminally bleach all fluorophores . Finally , we note that the OTC also makes it feasible to revisit imaged cells days or weeks later , which is useful when additional data are needed on e . g . the cellular context of a previously recorded image . In practice , preparation longevity was lim - ited by dissociation of the antibodies / labels from the epitopes . In conclusion , oxygen tight chambers present convenient preparations in all cases where preparation longevity is vital . Conclusion We have addressed several critical steps in preparation and image acquisition of localization microscopy . First , we formulated and tested a new imaging buffer , OxEA , which routinely sup - ports blinking of several dyes for multi - color imaging . OxEA works well with a number of dyes commonly used in SR , including Alexa - 488 , Alexa - 555 , Alexa - 647 and Cy5 . Moreover , it sup - ports blinking of FITC , which is advantageous because many laboratories have stockpiles of FITC - labeled antibodies . A good buffer for multi - color SR imaging should support effective pumping of dyes to the dark state , bright blinking , a good ratio between on - and off - state durations , and it should pre - vent terminal bleaching of the dyes so as to allow acquisition of very large series of frames . In addition , the buffer should not run down or acidify . In Gloxy buffer , protection against acidifi - cation has been improved by inclusion of 50 mM TRIS buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) [ 14 ] ; however , Alexa - 532 , a second labeling color often used in recent literature , does not blink well under these cir - cumstances ( see S1 Fig ) . While it is clear that OxEA does not acidify or run out as fast as Gloxy buffer , it is difficult to point out one single property that explains why OxEA supports multi - color blinking so well . Our results indicate that the pumping phase proceeds fast and efficiently in OxEA . This results in less ( structured ) background in the raw images , which increases the number of above - threshold blinks . Compared to Gloxy buffer , blinking intensity is also aug - mented for Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 555 , although we note that the combination of fresh Gloxy buffer with Alexa - 647 still yields highest intensity blinks . Furthermore , OxEA also protects dyes against terminal bleaching , as we were routinely able to collect > 100 . 000 frames from the same cell . This result indicates that individual fluorophores also re - blink more frequently in OxEA buffer , although this aspect is difficult to quantify and has not been addressed systemati - cally in this study . In ageing Gloxy buffer , blinking properties of Alexa - 488 appear to change considerably ( Fig 5E ) , i . e . , the majority of blinks span many frames . We also observed blink intensity to drop considerably , although this appeared somewhat variable . In contrast , during extended time series in OxEA , blinking properties were much more stable . While testing various methods to seal preparations to prevent oxygen influx we observed that the commonly recommended two - component sealant Twinsil is rather permeable to oxy - gen . Instead , we showed that adhesive - backed aluminum foil performs well for this application . In such oxygen - tight preparations , we were able to record near - unlimited numbers of frames , which allowed us to constructs very high density 3D stacks and large stitched images . Finally , we addressed preparation drift in some detail . These studies identified two low - drift solutions . First , for mounting 24 mm coverslips we found that a magnetic coverslip mount , Live Cell Instruments Chamlide ( CM - B25 - 1 ) performs significantly better than screw - type mounting rings , probably because the latter cause strain in the coverslip . In addition , together with WillCo Wells , a disposable solution has been developed and tested . In these dishes , Optimizing Super Resolution Imaging PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 July 8 , 2016 13 / 18 improved bonding of the coverslip to the plastic dish remedied most of the drift . Both of these preparations can be sealed effectively with adhesive - backed aluminum tape to construct oxy - gen - tight chambers for prolonged imaging . In summary , we have introduced incremental improvements in imaging buffer , measure - ment chamber and sealing methods to improve both multicolor SR imaging and preparation longevity significantly . Materials and Methods Cell culture Ultra - clean coverslips were prepared by acid / base rinsing as follows : first , nr 1 . 5 coverslips ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , USA ) were washed in 2M HCl overnight , followed by a 2 - hour wash in 2M NaOh and an additional wash in 20 % H 3 PO 4 . Inbetween those steps , cover - slips were briefly rinsed with double - distilled H 2 O . Storage until further use was in ethanol . For imaging , immortalized Human Vascular Endothelial Cells EC - RF24 [ 21 ] or PA - JEB / β 4 kerati - nocytes [ 22 ] ( were seeded on either ultra clean coverslips or Wilco well glass bottom dishes ( Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) optimized for SR ( GWSB - 3512 - N ) . The latter dishes we found to be clean enough for SR imaging without the need for acid / base rinsing . EC - RF24 cells were grown in Medium 200 ( M - 200 - 500 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with the addition of Low Serum Growth Supplement ( LSGS , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , USA ) until they reached 50 % confluency and then fixed with 10 % MeS buffer ( 100 mM MeS , pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) and 90 % methanol for 5 min on ice . PA - JEB / β 4 cells were fixed with glutaralde - hyde to preserve actin structure ( incubation with 0 . 3 % glutaraldehyde + 0 . 25 % Triton in a buffer containing 10 mM MES pH 6 . 1 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA and 5 mM MgCl 2 ) for 2 min , followed by 10 min fixation in 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in the same buffer ( no Triton present ) . Subsequently , the sample was treated with freshly prepared 0 . 1 % NaBH 4 for 10 min . After blocking with 5 % Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ; Serva , Heidelberg , Germany ) for 1 hour , cells were stained as follows . For EC - RF24 cells were incubated with mouse anti - vimentin monoclo - nal antibodies ( code No . M 0725 Clone V9 , Dako , Heverlee , Belgium ) . Subsequently all the cells were incubated with goat anti - mouse antibodies ( Alexa - 488 , Alexa - 647 , Alexa - 555 , Alexa - 532 or FITC , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at a final concentration of 0 . 01 mg / ml for 30 minutes . For PA - JEB / β 4 cells staining was with rabbit anti - keratin 14 polyclonal antibody ( Covance , Princeton , USA ) , rat anti - β 4 ( BD biosciences , Breda , The Netherlands ) and Phalloidin conju - gated to Alexa Fluor 647 fluorophores ( Invitrogen ) . Samples were incubated with goat anti - rabbit and goat anti - rat secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 555 fluoro - phores ( Invitrogen ) afterwards . All the fixation and staining steps were done at room temperature . The Coverslips were mounted in a holder ( Chamlide CMB mounting ring CM - B25 - 1 , Live Cell Instrument , Seoul , South Korea ) filled with 500 μ l of imaging buffer ( see below ) . After mounting the preparation on the microscope , we waited for ~ 15 min in order for the prepara - tion to stabilize before starting imaging . In experiments aimed at assessing buffer quality , this waiting time was skipped and any drift was compensated for in software . For imaging in O 2 - tight sealed Willco Wells ( OTC ) , first the glass bottom was covered with ~ 100 μ l of Gloxy buffer . A rinsed coverslip was placed as a lid on the top of the well using a tweezer , taking care to avoid inclusion of air bubbles in the imaging medium . Then the excess buffer was dried carefully , and pieces of black non - reflective aluminum tape T205 - 1 . 0 — AT205 ( THORLABs Inc , Newton , New Jersey , USA ) were applied in a partly overlapping manner and carefully pressed down to seal the preparation .

We used a 160x oil immersion dedicated SR objective . For three - dimensional images the Leica astigmatic lens was used . Between 10 . 000 to 100 . 000 frames were collected at 100 Hz with image size of 180×180 or 400×400 pixels . The data sets were analyzed with the Image J ThunderSTORM analysis module [ 23 ] and images were reconstructed with a detection threshold of 200 photons , options sub pixel localization of molecules and uncertainty correction checked , with a rendering pixel size of 10 nm . Software drift correction ( ThunderSTORM ) was applied , using either the image cross - correlation algorithm ( Nr of bins = 10 ; magnification = 5 ) , or alternatively , by using fidu - cial markers , for which sub - resolution fluorescent beads were included in the preparation . For multi - color images , first Alexa - 647 was imaged , followed by Alexa - 488 ( using a 500 / 30 band - pass filter to prevent leak - through of Alexa - 555 ) . After Alexa - 488 was largely bleached due to long - term imaging the third channel ( Alexa - 555 or Alexa - 532 ) was imaged . Series of raw blinking images were first subjected to running - median background subtrac - tion [ 24 ] using an in - house developed Image J macro . All images where further corrected for chromatic aberrations . Composition of the imaging buffers 1 . OxEA (cid:129) 50 mM β - MercaptoEthylamine hydrochloride ( MEA , Sigma - Aldrich ) (cid:129) 3 % ( v / v ) OxyFlour ™ ( Oxyrase Inc . , Mansfield , Ohio , U . S . A . ) (cid:129) 20 % ( v / v ) of sodium DL - lactate solution ( L1375 , Sigma - Aldrich ) (cid:129) in PBS , pH adjusted to 8 – 8 . 5 with NaOH 2 . Gloxy buffer (cid:129) 50 mM β - MercaptoEthylamine hydrochloride ( MEA , Sigma - Aldrich ) (cid:129) 10 % ( v / v ) of a 250 g / l solution of glucose (cid:129) 0 . 5 mg / ml glucose oxidase (cid:129) 40 mg / ml catalase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) (cid:129) in PBS , pH 7 . 6 3 . MEA buffer (cid:129) 50 mM β - MercaptoEthylamine hydrochloride ( MEA , Sigma - Aldrich ) (cid:129) in PBS All buffers were prepared freshly in 500 μ l aliquots before imaging unless otherwise noted in the text . According to the supplier , repeated freezing / thawing is detrimental to Oxyrase solu - tions . For pH buffering , we prefer phosphate buffers over HEPES buffers ( because of the unfa - vorable redox behavior of HEPES ) or TRIS buffers ( unfavorable pKa because it should give maximal protection against acidification in Gloxy ) . Optimizing Super Resolution Imaging PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0158884 July 8 , 2016 15 / 18 Analysis of blinking characteristics Assessment of dye blinking properties was carried out as follows . Series of raw images were background - corrected and analyzed using ThunderSTORM with default settings , except : magnification = 10x to obtain final pixel size of 10 nm . Result files ( (cid:1) . csv ) where then subjected to drift correction ( using either a self - written Image J macro or the ThunderSTORM build - in drift correction option ) and blinks present in consecutive frames were merged in 2D ( maxi - mum distance = 20 nm , maximum off - frames = 1 ) . For analysis of blinking brightness ( Fig 5B ) 100 , 000 blinks were averaged per movie in SPSS statistical software . Data are average + / - SEM from 3 – 15 individual experiments for each condition , using different batches of buffers and on at least 2 days of experimentation . Analysis of the number of blinks per frame ( Fig 5C and 5D ) was based on comma - separated value ( . csv ) files corrected as indicated above , using a home - written analysis routine in Visual Basic . net to calculate total number of blinks in blocks of 1000 raw frames . Visualization of blink duration ( Fig 5E ) was by manually drawing small ROI around blinks in a given frame , followed by plotting intensity in the ROI in frames - 50 to + 50 with respect to the given frame using Image J < Stack / Plot Z - axis Profile > option . We note that it is not trivial to determine these blinking properties precisely because the rel - evant properties are not necessarily independent . For example , the presence of significant structured background in Gloxy buffer may result in an underestimation of the number of detected blinks per frame in the first part of the time - series . For that reason , we have refrained from statistical testing of the observed differences . Quantification of preparation drift For quantification of drift , we first quantitated stability of the Leica GSDIM microscope with SuMo Stage using 0 . 4 μ m fluorescent TetraSpeck microspheres ( Invitrogen , Waltham , Mas . , USA ) immobilized on thick preparation slides and embedded in Mowiol . For drift measure - ments in imaging chambers , beads were immobilized to the glass coverslip by air - drying a diluted solution . In all cases , mean displacement away from the origin was determined using an Image J macro to find the center of intensity in each of the beads and then averaged over all beads in the image . After an initial stabilization period of 15 min , images were collected every second for the duration of one hour at low intensity excitation . Drift was expressed in nm / min and total ( accumulated ) drift was also calculated for a period of 30 min and for 60 min . During these experiments the room was kept closed because we observed that draft may significantly degrade stability . Detection of dissolved Oxygen levels Dissolved oxygen levels were measured using a calibrated FireSting O 2 meter ( PyroScience , Aachen , Germany ) according to the manufacturers guidelines . We used OXSP5 sensor pads which work both in dry and submersed condition . In the experiments for Fig 7B , sensor pads were stuck to the dish , then wetted and covered with either Twinsil of adhesive - backed alumi - num tape . Dishes with sealed sensors were then filled with water . Continuous O 2 measure - ments were started from the submerged sensor pads and after about 10 minutes , oxygen scavenger ( either Gloxy or 50 mM of NaSO 3 ) was added .
