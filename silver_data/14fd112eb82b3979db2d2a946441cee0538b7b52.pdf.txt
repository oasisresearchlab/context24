Here , we analysed publicly available 12 transcriptome data from the brain and blood of 449 HD patients and 212 healthy controls . We 13 identified 737 and 661 genes with robustly altered mRNA levels in the brain and blood of HD 14 patients , respectively . In the brain , a subnetwork of 320 genes strongly correlated with HD 15 and was enriched in transport - related genes . Bioinformatical analysis of this subnetwork 16 highlighted CDC42 , PAK1 , NFY , DLX1 , HMGN3 , and PRMT3 . Moreover , we found that 17 CREB1 can regulate 78 . 0 % of genes whose mRNA levels correlated with HD in the blood of 18 patients . Our meta - analysis indicates that alterations in protein transport , metabolism , 19 transcriptional regulation , and CDC42 - mediated functions are central features of HD . Further 20 our data substantiate the role of transcriptional regulators that have not been reported in the 21 context of HD such as DLX1 , HMGN3 and PRMT3 and strongly suggest transcriptional 22 dysregulation of NFY and its target genes across tissues . 23 Keywords : Huntingtin / neurodegeneration / weighted gene co - expression network analyses / 24 robust rank aggregation analysis 25 Page 3 Introduction 26 Huntingtin ( HTT ) functions in diverse cellular processes such as autophagy , endocytosis , 27 vessicle transport , and transcriptional regulation ( Saudou & Humbert , 2016 ) . A triplet repeat 28 expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene results in the expansion of an N - terminal polyglutamine 29 tract and causes Huntington’s disease ( HD ) ( The Huntington ' s Disease Collaborative 30 Research Group , 1993 ) . Clinically , a progressive loss of motor functions , cognitive 31 impairment , and psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety ( Ross & Tabrizi , 2011 ) 32 characterises HD . Besides neurological symptoms , HD patients suffer from a plethora of non - 33 neuronal symptoms such as cardiac failure , muscle atrophy , impaired glucose tolerance , 34 osteoporosis , weight loss , and testicular atrophy ( van der Burg et al , 2009 ) . 35 Expansion of the N - terminal polyQ tract impairs the multi - faceted function of HTT and its 36 interaction with numerous other proteins ( Shirasaki et al , 2012 ; Zuccato & Cattaneo , 2014 ) . 37 Mutant huntingtin ( mHTT ) , for instance , induces the activation of microglia , leading to 38 increased secretion of interleukin - 1β ( IL - 1β ) , tumour necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF ) and 39 increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ( Crotti & Glass , 2015 ) . Tabrizi et al . 40 and Fan and Raymond showed that mHTT impairs the glutamate uptake in astrocytes leading 41 to excitotoxicity ( Tabrizi et al , 1999 ; Fan & Raymond , 2007 ) . Aberrant splicing of the mHTT 42 mRNA results in the formation of a truncated HTT exon - 1 protein forming nuclear and 43 cytoplasmic inclusions ( Gipson et al , 2013 ) . R6 / 2 mice with a knock - in of exon - 1 of human 44 HTT show a more severe disease progression than mouse models with a knock - in of full - 45 length mutant HTT ( Gipson et al , 2013 ) . The study of several huntingtin - interaction partners 46 and their impaired function in HD further suggested impaired trafficking of clathrin - coated 47 and non - coated vesicles in HD patients ( Velier et al , 1998 ; Harjes & Wanker , 2003 ) . 48 Transcriptomic studies of HD patients , cell lines , and mouse models expressing mHTT 49 observed transcriptional dysregulation of a plethora of genes ( Borovecki et al , 2005 ; Runne et 50 al , 2007 ; Hu et al , 2011 ; Narayanan et al , 2014 ; Labadorf et al , 2015 ; Labadorf et al , 2017 ; 51 Agus et al , 2019 ) , although the identified differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) differed 52 strongly among the studies . Several mechanisms behind the broad transcriptional 53 dysregulation such as altered expression of enhancer RNAs ( Le Gras et al , 2017 ) , 54 sequestration of transcription factors ( e . g . CREB1 , TBP , or mSin3a ) ( Cha , 2000 ; McCampbell 55 et al , 2000 ; Steffan et al , 2000 ; Sugars & Rubinsztein , 2003 ) , or the sequestration of proteins 56 such as the muscleblind - like splicing regulator 1 ( MBNL1 ) , nucleolin , and proteins of the 57 small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) machinery ( Nalavade et al , 2013 ; Martí , 2016 ) have been 58 Page 4 discussed . 59 As noted before , previously published analyses of transcriptomic profiles from HD patients 60 yielded varying results . Since a thorough knowledge of pathological mechanisms behind HD 61 is essential for the design of further biochemical studies and development of therapies , we 62 performed a meta - analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data from HD patients to 63 identify genes altered in several studies . Within our meta - analysis , we found 661 or 737 genes 64 with robustly altered mRNA levels in the blood and brain of HD patients , respectively . 65 Strongly suggesting that dysfunction in protein transport and metabolism are central in HD , 66 we identified by weighted gene co - expression network analysis a subnetwork of 320 genes , 67 enriched in genes functioning in protein transport , that strongly correlated with HD in the 68 brain . Additionally , we identified the cell division cycle 42 ( CDC42 ) , p21 ( CDC42 / RAC1 ) 69 Activated Kinase 1 ( PAK1 ) , 14 - 3 - 3 protein eta ( YWHAH ) , and protein phosphatase - 2 70 catalytic subunit α ( PP2CA ) as hub genes of this subnetwork . Transcription factor enrichment 71 analysis ( TFEA ) highlighted distal - less homeobox 1 ( DLX1 ) , high mobility group 72 nucleosomal binding domain 3 ( HMGN3 ) , and protein arginine methyltransferase 3 ( PRMT3 ) 73 in this subnetwork . Similarly , a subnetwork of 118 genes , including genes coding for 74 constituents of the Arp2 / Arp3 complex , were significantly altered in the blood of HD patients . 75 Strikingly , 78 . 0 % of the genes in this blood subnetwork were direct or indirect targets of the 76 CREB1 . 77 Results 78 Transcriptional changes in the brain of HD patients 79 Since neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the pathognomonic features of HD and 80 possess a high disease burden for HD patients , several transcriptomic studies investigated 81 transcriptional changes in the brain of HD patients . In this meta - analysis , we included three 82 published transcriptomic studies using post - mortem brain tissue from the prefrontal cortex 83 ( NCBI accession number : GSE33000 and GSE64810 ) ( Narayanan et al , 2014 ; Labadorf et al , 84 2015 ) and the caudate nucleus of prodromal HD patients ( NCBI accession number 85 GSE129473 ) ( Agus et al , 2019 ) . As described above , this meta - analysis aims at identifying 86 promising candidates for further functional studies and improving our understanding of 87 transcription factors and mechanism which are mainly affected in the brain of HD patients . 88 To identify genes with significantly altered mRNA levels in those three studies , we 89 determined differentially expressed genes for each study separately , ranked them after their 90 Page 5 absolute Z - ratio and performed a robust rank aggregation analysis ( RRA ) . Thereby , we 91 identified 737 differentially expressed genes ( RRA score < 0 . 05 ) that were among the most 92 altered genes in the analysed datasets ( Additional file 1 ) . 93 Based on all genes identified by RRA ( Additional file 1 ) , we performed a weighted gene co - 94 expression analysis ( WGCNA ) to identify gene modules , i . e . clusters of highly correlated 95 genes . Adjacency and the topological overlap matrix ( TOM ) for the gene network were 96 calculated with a soft - thresholding power β of 14 . 5 for which the WGCNA network satisfies 97 the criterion of scale - free topology ( R² = 0 . 85 ) ( Additional file 2 ) . By module - based 98 clustering with the diagonal , varying volume , and shape model ( VVI ) , we identified nine 99 modules of which the module eigengenes ( first principal component ) of seven modules 100 ( black , blue , red , brown , magenta , and turquoise ) statistically significantly correlated with 101 disease state ( HD patients versus healthy individuals ) as determined by correlation analysis 102 ( Figure 1A ) . Corroborating a potential link between genes in the black , brown and turquoise 103 modules with HD , we found a positive and statistically significant correlation between 104 module membership , defined as the probability that a gene belongs to this module , and gene 105 significance , defined as the correlation between the expression values and the trait of interest , 106 of 0 . 46 ( p = 0 . 004 ) , 0 . 47 ( p = 1e - 04 ) , and 0 . 41 ( p = 0 . 008 ) , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . 107 Additionally , genes belonging to the black and brown module showed a high mean gene 108 significance ( Figure 1B ) . In contrast , indicating that transcriptomic alterations of genes of the 109 turquoise modules were less pronounced than the genes of the black and brown module , we 110 observed a low mean gene significance of genes of this module . Corroborating the results of 111 our network analysis , we found that most of the identified genes or proteins are known to 112 interact with several other proteins belonging to the same module . For instance , according to 113 the network analysis in GeneMania , 94 . 05 % and 94 . 11 % of the genes are known to be co - 114 expressed in humans . Likewise , network analysis using the STRING database ( confidence 115 cut - off = 0 . 4 ) ( Szklarczyk et al , 2019 ) showed that 34 of 53 proteins ( 64 . 2 % ) of the black and 116 36 of 81 proteins ( 44 . 4 % ) of the brown module interact with at least one other protein ( data 117 not shown ) . 118 Based on the clustering analysis of the modules eigengenes ( Figure 1C ) and the similarity of 119 the eigengene adjacency ( Figure 1D ) , we grouped the observed modules in three meta - 120 modules : the first meta - module ( M1 ) consisted of the black , blue , magenta , and red module , 121 the second meta - module ( M2 ) consisted of the brown , green and turquoise module , and the 122 third meta - module ( M3 ) consisted of the yellow and pink module . Combining the identified 123 WGCNA modules to meta - modules and subsequent analysis of this meta - modules 124 Page 6 demonstrated a high correlation with HD ( correlation r = 0 . 5 , p - value = 1e - 38 ) , a positive 125 correlation between gene significance and module membership of 0 . 73 ( p - value = 2e - 54 ) , and 126 the highest mean gene significance of all meta - modules for M1 ( Figure 2A and B ) . 127 Corroborating the importance of genes belonging to M1 , the eigengene and adjacency of M1 128 clustered together with the disease state ( Figure 2C and D ) . According to STRING , protein - 129 protein interactions were strongly enriched in M1 ( 826 observed edges , 602 expected edges , 130 and p < 1 . 0e - 16 ) at minimal interaction confidence of 0 . 4 . While the eigengene of M2 131 correlated with HD , we could not observe a positive correlation between gene significance 132 and module membership and , therefore , did not analyse this meta - module further . 133 Owing to the high similarity between modules of the same meta - module , we performed the 134 transcription factor enrichment analysis ( TFEA ) and the subsequent GO - term enrichment 135 analysis on the meta - modules M1 instead of single modules . Characterising functional 136 enrichment of genes belonging to the M1 subnetwork , we performed enrichment analyses 137 against the gene ontology ( GO ) and Reactome database . Using the GO database , we found an 138 enrichment of genes involved in protein transport ( GO : 0015031 , 12 . 8 % of genes in M1 and 139 FDR = 0 . 046 ) ( Figure 3A ) such as the Ras - related proteins 11A ( RAB11A ) , 2A ( RAB2A ) , 14 140 ( RAB14 ) , syntaxin - 7 ( STX7 ) , syntaxin - 12 ( STX12 ) , or the sorting nexin 3 ( SNX3 ) in M1 . 141 Among the three datasets , the 41 proteins that belonged to M1 and function in protein 142 transport processes showed a strong up - regulation in HD patient samples with a median Z - 143 ratio of 1 . 51 ( Figure 3B ) . To also include genes with lower Z - ratios into the functional 144 enrichment analyses , irrespective of their module membership , we additionally conducted 145 gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) of the three datasets independently . Strongly suggesting 146 that the alteration of genes involved in protein transport may be relevant in HD , we found a 147 strong enrichment of proteins involved in the co - translational protein targeting to the 148 membrane in all three datasets by GSEA ( Figure 3E ) . Additionally , genes functioning in 149 cellular metabolic processes ( GO : 0044237 , 56 . 3 % of genes in M1 and FDR = 0 . 023 ) , cellular 150 respiration ( GO : 0045333 , 3 . 4 % of genes in M1 and FDR = 0 . 027 ) and translation 151 ( GO : 0006412 , 5 . 6 % of genes in M1 , and FDR = 0 . 023 ) were statistically significantly 152 enriched in the M1 subnetwork . Similarly , when using the Reactome database , we observed a 153 strong enrichment of proteins involved in protein metabolism , gene expression ( transcription ) 154 and post - translational protein modification ( Figure 3D ) . Using the network enrichment 155 analysis test ( NEAT ) , we found a highly statistically significant over - enrichment of 38 KEGG 156 pathways in M1 ( Additional file 3 ) . Among these enriched pathways were “SNARE 157 interaction in vesicular transport” ( adjusted p - value = 1 . 74e - 33 ) , “RNA transport” ( adjusted 158 Page 7 p - value = 2 . 10E - 217 ) , and “mRNA surveillance pathway” ( adjusted p - value = 9 . 63E - 60 ) 159 ( Additional file 3 ) . 160 To identify highly connected genes within the M1 subnetwork , we computed hub genes , i . e . 161 genes with high intramodular connectivity , gene significance and module membership ( Table 162 1 , Additional file 4 ) . Among these hub genes was the cell division cycle 42 protein ( CDC42 ) 163 ( Z - ratios : 1 . 72 ; 1 . 83 ; 1 . 45 in GSE33000 , GSE129473 and GSE64810 respectively ) , a 164 membrane - associated small GTPase that interacts with several effector proteins and thereby 165 regulates cell migration ( Modzelewska et al , 2006 ) , the bipolar attachment of spindle 166 microtubules to kinetochores ( Oceguera - Yanez et al , 2005 ) , the extension and maintenance of 167 the formation of filopodia , the dedicator of cytokinesis 10 ( DOCK10 ) mediated spine 168 formation ( Gauthier - Campbell et al , 2004 ) , and the structural plasticity of dendritic spines 169 ( Gauthier - Campbell et al , 2004 ) . Further corroborating the importance of CDC42 in the 170 subnetwork correlating with HD , CDC42 was additionally central in the M1 protein - protein 171 interaction network , constructed using the STRING database ( Additional file 5 ) . Together 172 with CDC42 , we identified 18 proteins with altered mRNA levels in all datasets that were 173 directly connected with CDC42 according to the STRING database . Further , CDC42 interacts 174 with other identified hub genes such as the P21 / Cdc42 / Rac1 - Activated Kinase 1 ( PAK1 ) 175 ( Manser et al , 1994 ) , 14 - 3 - 3 protein eta ( YWHAH ) , or the protein phosphatase 2 catalytic 176 subunit α ( PPP2CA ) . mRNA levels of the CDC42 small effector 2 ( CDC42SE2 ) , that 177 functions downstream of CDC42 , was upregulated in the brain of HD patients ( Z - ratios : 2 . 17 ; 178 0 . 97 ; 1 . 2 ) . Additionally , CDC42 can interact with the CDC42 - interacting protein 4 ( CIP4 ) , 179 also known as thyroid hormone receptor interactor 10 ( TRIP10 ) and HTT ( Holbert et al , 180 2003 ; Hsu et al , 2011 ) . that was not robustly dysregulated in our meta - analysis ( Z - ratios - 181 1 . 35 , - 0 . 03 , 0 . 51 ) . Besides the interaction of CIP4 / TRIP10 with HTT and CDC42 , CIP4 / 182 TRIP10 can interact with the vesicle - associated membrane protein 2 ( VAMP2 ) and 7 183 ( VAMP7 ) which are linked with other genes robustly altered in the brain of HD patients such 184 as the vesicle - associated membrane protein 1 ( VAMP1 ) and the Ras - related Protein Rab - 14 185 ( RAB14 ) ( Lu & Wilson , 2016 ) . 186 In addition , we identified PAK1 ( Z - ratios : 2 . 07 ; - 0 . 42 ; 0 . 299 ) , which can interact with 187 CDC42 , as a hub gene in the M1 subnetwork . Additionally , the PAK1 Interacting Protein 1 188 ( PAK1IP1 ) , which inhibits the activation of PAK1 by CDC42 through its interaction with the 189 N - terminus of PAK1 ( Xia et al , 2001 ) , was upregulated in the brain of HD patients in all 190 studies ( Z - ratios : 1 . 88 ; 1 . 10 ; 1 . 98 ) . Since PAK1 , as well as PAK2 and PAK3 , belong to the 191 group A PAKs ( Harms et al , 2018 ) , we also analysed mRNA levels of other group A PAKs . 192 Page 8 While PAK2 was not robustly altered in the brain of HD patients ( Z - ratios : - 1 . 43 ; 1 . 31 ; 0 . 7 ) , 193 PAK3 mRNA levels ( Z - ratios : 1 . 98 ; 0 . 46 ; 0 . 70 ) were slightly elevated in the brain of HD 194 patients , although it was not identified by RRA ( p = 0 . 10 ) . Both CDC42 and PAK1 are 195 interacting with another hub gene , the protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit alpha 196 ( PPP2CA ) ( Z - ratios : 1 . 98 ; 0 . 74 ; 1 . 91 ) ( Figure 4B ) , which is an important phosphatase for 197 microtubule - associated proteins . PPP2CA was additionally the most central protein in the 198 network analysis of the M1 protein - protein interaction network ( Additional file 5 ) . 199 Broad transcriptional dysregulation upon HD was often linked to direct interaction of mHTT 200 with proteins of the small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) machinery ( Cha , 2000 ; McCampbell et 201 al , 2000 ; Steffan et al , 2000 ; Sugars & Rubinsztein , 2003 ; Nalavade et al , 2013 ; Martí , 2016 ) 202 and different transcriptional regulators such as CREB1 , TBP , mSin3a , MBNL1 , nucleolin , 203 histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) , or the DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) . Therefore , we 204 performed a transcription factor enrichment analysis ( TFEA ) of the M1 subnetwork to define 205 which transcription factors would best explain the observed alterations in the brain of HD 206 patients . Analysis of the target genes of the top five TFEA hits , the mitochondrial 207 transcription termination factor 3 ( MTERF3 ) , Myb / SANT DNA binding domain containing 4 208 with coiled - coils ( MSANTD4 ) , small nuclear RNA activating complex polypeptide 5 209 ( SNPAC5 ) , zinc finger protein 833 ( ZNF833 ) , and thymocyte nuclear protein 1 ( THYN1 ) , 210 showed that most of their target genes was upregulated in the brain of HD patients ( Figure 5 211 and Additional file 6 ) . mRNA levels of MTERF3 , MSANTD4 , SNPAC5 , ZNF833 and 212 THYN1 were not consistently altered in the brain of HD patients . Alongside with the mRNA 213 levels of their target genes , mRNA levels of the distal - less homeobox 1 ( DLX1 ) ( regulates 214 11 . 9 % of M1 , TFEA rank = 6 , Z - ratios : 2 . 21 ; 0 . 16 ; 1 . 04 ) , protein arginine methyltransferase 215 3 ( PRMT3 ) ( regulates 11 . 6 % of M1 , TFEA rank = 14 , Z - ratios : 0 . 46 ; 2 . 65 ; 1 . 11 ) , and nuclear 216 transcription factor Y subunit β ( NFYB ) ( regulates 29 . 7 % of M1 , TFEA rank = 24 , Z - ratios : 217 1 . 05 ; 2 . 39 ; 2 . 02 ) were robustly upregulated in the brain of HD patients ( Figure 5 and 218 Additional file 6 ) . Additionally , mRNA levels of the high mobility group nucleosomal 219 binding domain 3 ( HMGN3 ) ( regulates 24 . 1 % of M1 , TFEA rank = 13 , Z - ratios : - 0 . 91 ; 1 . 90 ; 220 1 . 77 ) , that was additionally ranked high in the TFEA , appeared to be upregulated in only two 221 of three studies and slightly downregulated in the other study ( Additional files 1 and 6 ) . 222 Strikingly , we noted that transcriptions factors that have previously been shown to be affected 223 by mHTT such as CREB1 ( rank 182 ) or TBP ( rank 208 ) were ranked low or could not be 224 detected at all ( mSin3a ) by TFEA . 225 Besides the effects of mHTT on transcription factors , previous publications indicated that the 226 Page 9 dysregulation of epigenetic modifiers such as DNMT1 or histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) 227 ( Federspiel et al , 2019 ; Siebzehnrübl et al , 2018 ; Moreno et al , 2016 ) might contribute to the 228 broad transcriptional dysregulation in HD . In our meta - analysis , HDCA2 ( Z - ratios : 0 . 69 , 1 . 84 , 229 1 . 86 ) and HDAC9 ( Z - ratios : 2 . 26 , 0 . 88 , 1 . 42 ) were upregulated in the brain of HD patients , 230 while the histone deacetylase 5 ( HDAC5 ) mRNA levels were decreased ( Z - ratios : - 0 . 18 ; - 231 2 . 17 ; - 2 . 02 ) . By RRA , we did not identify DNMT1 , DNMT3A , or DNMT3B as robustly 232 altered genes . Nonetheless , we noted a downregulation of DNMT1 ( Z - ratio 0 . 48 ; - 1 . 35 , - 233 1 . 72 ) and DNMT3A ( Z - ratio : 0 . 54 , - 1 . 38 , - 2 . 20 ) in datasets from Agus et al . 2019 and 234 Labadorf et al . , while both , DNMT1 and DNMT3A , were slightly upregulated in the larger 235 dataset from Narayanan et al . , 2014 . DNMT3B ( Z - ratio : - 0 . 76 ; - 0 . 31 ; - 0 . 79 ) was mostly 236 unaltered in the brain of HD patients in all datasets . 237 Taken together , mRNA levels of 320 genes of the M1 co - expression network strongly 238 correlated with HD and genes involved in protein transport and metabolism were enriched in 239 this co - expression subnetwork ( Figure 3 ) . CDC42 , PAK1 , YWHAH and PP2CA were 240 identified as hub genes of this network . Especially substantiating on the relevance of CDC42 , 241 CDC42 has been indirectly linked with HD before ( Holbert et al , 2003 ) and can indirectly or 242 directly interact with other identified hubs and 18 other proteins with robustly altered mRNA 243 levels in the brain of HD patients . Further , the TFEA of the M1 subnetwork highlighted 244 DLX1 , NFY and HMGN3 as potential transcriptional regulators whose function might be 245 affected in the brain of HD patients . Additionally , the mRNA levels of several epigenetic 246 modifiers such as HDAC2 , HDAC9 , DNMT1 , and DNMT3A were altered in at least two of 247 the three studies using HD brain samples . 248 Transcriptional changes in the blood of HD patients 249 As afore - described , HTT is ubiquitously expressed and HD symptoms are not confined to the 250 central nervous system ( van der Burg et al , 2009 ; Saudou & Humbert , 2016 ) . Hence , we 251 additionally analysed transcriptomic studies of blood samples from HD patients and healthy 252 controls . Borovecki et al . 2005 ( GSE1751 ) analysed the transcriptomic profile of twelve 253 symptomatic and five presymptomatic HD patients in comparison to 14 healthy controls , 254 whereas Hu et al . 2011 ( GSE24520 ) included venous cellular whole blood samples from 6 255 healthy controls and 8 HD patients . Transcriptomic profiles of lymphocytes from 12 moderate 256 stage HD patients and 10 age - matched healthy controls were analysed by Runne et al . 2007 257 ( GSE8762 ) . 258 By robust rank aggregation ( RRA ) , we identified 661 genes differentially expressed upon HD 259 Page 10 among the three datasets ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Additional file 1 ) . Based on those 661 genes with a soft - 260 thresholding power β = 19 . 5 ( scale - free topology R2 = 0 . 87 ) ( Additional file 2 ) and 261 subsequent module - based clustering with the diagonal , equal volume , varying shape ( EVI ) 262 model , we identified nine WGCNA modules . Of these modules , the module eigengene of 263 three modules ( brown , pink , and yellow ) statistically significantly correlated with the disease 264 state ( healthy individuals versus HD ) ( Figure 6A ) . While genes of the brown module showed 265 a negative correlation between module membership and gene significance , genes of the pink 266 and yellow modules showed a positive correlation ( Figure 6A ) . Corroborating the importance 267 of genes of the pink and yellow modules , genes of these modules showed the highest mean 268 gene significance of all identified modules ( Figure 6B ) . Further , 94 . 12 % and 86 . 55 % of the 269 genes belonging to either the pink or yellow module were annotated by GeneMania to be co - 270 expressed in humans . Owing to the low distance between the modules eigengenes of the pink 271 and yellow modules ( Figure 6C ) and the highly similar adjacency of these modules ( Figure 272 6D ) , we combined these modules for further downstream analysis and will further refer to this 273 module as the blood meta - module ( MB ) . 274 Like the enrichment of the meta - module M1 identified in the brain samples , we found a 275 strong enrichment of proteins involved in transport ( FDR = 0 . 03 and 35 . 6 % of all genes in 276 MB ) and metabolic processes ( FDR = 0 . 03 and 66 . 9 % of all genes in MB ) in the MB 277 subnetwork ( Figure 7A and B ) . Consistent with the enrichment of proteins involved in protein 278 transport , we found a strong enrichment of proteins localised to endosome membranes ( FDR 279 = 0 . 002 and 9 . 3 % of genes in MB ) ( Figure 7C ) . Among the 11 proteins localised to 280 endosome membranes were the vesicle - associated membrane protein 7 ( VAMP7 ) ( Z - ratios - 281 1 . 47 ; 0 . 99 ; 3 . 3 ) , a paralog of VAMP2 that also displayed altered mRNA levels in the brain , 282 and the sorting nexin 10 ( SNX10 ) that is involved in membrane trafficking and protein sorting 283 ( Worby & Dixon , 2002 ) . Additionally , we observed dysregulation of the actin - related proteins 284 ACTR2 / Arp2 ( Z - ratio : - 0 . 95 ; - 1 . 75 ; 3 . 15 ) , ACTR3 / Arp3 ( - 1 . 92 ; - 1 . 62 ; 2 . 78 ) , and ARPC5 ( - 1 ; 285 - 1 . 87 ; 2 . 24 ) that together with ARBC1A , ARBC1B , ARPC3 , and ARPC4 form a seven - 286 subunit protein complex playing an essential role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton 287 ( Molinie & Gautreau , 2018 ) . By analysis of the MB protein - protein interaction network , 288 ACTR2 was the most important hub protein , which strongly substantiates on its 289 pathophysiological relevance in HD . Further indicating that transcriptional dysregulation of 290 regulators of the actin cytoskeleton may be important in HD , other actin - related proteins such 291 as ACTR3B ( Z - ratios : 1 . 3 ; 1 . 30 ; 1 . 62 ) , ACTR6 ( 1 . 38 ; 1 . 54 ; 1 . 88 ) and ACTR10 ( Z - ratios : 292 1 . 64 ; 1 . 23 ; 1 . 34 ) were robustly upregulated in the blood of HD patients according to this 293 Page 11 meta - analysis . The alteration of mRNA levels of constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex and 294 actin - related proteins further substantiates on the identification of CDC42 as an important hub 295 gene in the brain since CDC42 can activate the Arp2 / 3 complex through Wiskott - Aldrich 296 syndrome proteins ( Watson et al , 2017 ) such as WAS , WASF1 , WASF2 , WASF3 , and 297 WASL that appeared to be neither robustly altered in the brain nor in the blood of HD 298 patients . 299 To identify transcription factors that can regulate the transcription of genes belonging to MB , 300 we performed a TFEA ( Additional file 6 ) . The CGG Triplet Repeat Binding Protein 1 301 ( CGGBP1 ) , zinc finger protein 654 ( ZNF654 ) , forkhead box N2 ( FOXN2 ) , and the specificity 302 protein 3 transcription factor ( SP3 ) were ranked at the top in the TFEA . Strikingly , 303 transcription of these transcriptional regulators is regulated by the cAMP - responsive element - 304 binding protein - 1 ( CREBP1 ) . CREB1 was also ranked high ( rank 15 ) in the TFEA and can 305 regulate the transcription of genes coding for constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex and hub 306 genes of the MB subnetwork such as membrane - associated ring - CH - type finger 7 ( MARCH 307 7 ) , pumilio RNA binding family member 2 ( PUM2 ) , survival motor neuron domain 308 containing 1 ( SMNDC1 ) , or zinc finger DHHC - type palmitoyltransferase 17 ( ZDHHC17 ) , 309 also known as the huntingtin - interacting protein 14 ( HIP14 ) . CREB1 together with the other 310 enriched transcription factors regulated by CREB1 ( TET2 , SP3 , RLF , CGGBP1 , ZNF148 , 311 FOXN2 , ZNF654 , ZBTB11 , and ZNF770 ) regulates the transcription of 92 from 118 ( 78 . 0 % ) 312 genes belonging to MB ( Additional file 7 ) . 313 Taken together , the enrichment of proteins localised to endosome membranes further 314 corroborates the above - described alteration of protein - transport - related genes in the brain of 315 HD patients . The dysregulation of several constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex , that is 316 activated by CDC42 , substantiates on the relevance of actin cytoskeleton dysregulation in 317 HD . 318 52 genes were differentially regulated in the blood and brain of HD patients 319 As noted before , the ubiquitous expression of HTT ( Saudou & Humbert , 2016 ) and the 320 clinical manifestation of HD outside the central nervous system ( van der Burg et al , 2009 ) 321 indicates that transcriptomic changes caused by polyQ expansion of HTT may be not 322 confined to nervous tissues . According to our meta - analysis , 52 genes were dysregulated in 323 brain - and blood - derived samples from HD patients ( Additional file 1 ) . 324 Based on the genes / proteins altered in the blood and brain of HD patients , we constructed a 325 protein - protein interaction network ( Figure 8 ) to investigate the relationship between the 326 Page 12 identified genes . Furthermore , to identify transcription factors that might explain the observed 327 transcriptomic alterations , we conducted a transcription factor enrichment analysis . While 328 82 . 4 % of the proteins were annotated as co - expressed by GeneMania ( data not shown ) , 329 48 . 1 % were interacting with a least one other protein according to the STRING databases 330 ( interaction cutoff : 0 . 4 ) . 331 In our meta - analysis , we noted that mRNA levels of the zinc finger DHHC - Type 332 palmitoyltransferase 13 ( ZDHHC13 ) , i . e . huntingtin - interacting protein 14 ( HIP14 ) , and the 333 zinc finger DHHC - Type palmitoyltransferase 17 ( ZDHHC17 ) , i . e . huntingtin - interacting 334 protein 14 - like protein ( HIP14L ) were dysregulated in the blood and brain of HD 335 patients . Previous studies linked the altered interaction between mHTT and ZDHHC17 and 336 ZDHHC13 with altered regulation of the striatal N - Methyl - D - Aspartate Receptor ( NMDA ) 337 trafficking ( Kang et al , 2019 ) . 338 TFEA analysis of the 52 genes altered in the blood and brain of HD samples highlighted the 339 enrichment of NFY target genes ( rank 3 ) ( Additional file 7 ) . NFY is a trimeric complex of 340 proteins coded by the NFYA , NFYB , and NFYC genes . Besides the high ranking of NFYB in 341 the combined dataset ( rank 3 ) , targets of NFYB were also enriched in the M1 ( brain , rank 24 ) 342 and the blood ( rank 48 ) ( Additional file 7 ) . Moreover , NFYB ( Z - ratios in the brain datasets : 343 1 . 05 , 2 . 39 , 2 . 02 ) mRNA - levels and NFYB target genes ( mean Z - ratio : 1 . 62 ) were also 344 increased in the brain of HD patients ( Figure 5 and Additional file 1 ) . 345 HMGN3 , NFY and CDC42 mRNA were additionally altered in the striatum of YAC128 346 and R6 / 2 mice and predictive for HD 347 To further substantiate on the relevance of identified hub genes or transcriptional regulators 348 such as CDC42 , PAK1 , YWHAH , DLX1 , HMGN3 , or NFY , we analysed transcriptomic 349 alterations in the striatum of R6 / 2 ( Miyazaki et al , 2020 ) and YAC128 mice ( Becanovic et al , 350 2010 ) ( Additional file 8 ) . Furthermore , we assessed how accurate control and HD mice can be 351 discriminated based on mRNA levels of these genes ( Additional file 9 and 10 ) . 352 Indicating that NFY may play a role in HD across tissues , TFEA of the subnetworks M1 and 353 MB and the combined dataset highlighted NFY . Like in human HD patients , NFYA ( Z - ratios : 354 1 . 75 , 0 . 77 , 1 . 93 in 12 - month - old YAC128 , and 24 - month - old YAC128 mice respectively ) and 355 NFYB ( Z - ratios : 1 . 31 , 0 . 45 , 1 . 38 ) mRNA levels were elevated in R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice . 356 Additionally , control and HD mice could be well discriminated based on NFYA ( AUC = 357 0 . 86 ; 95 % CI = [ 0 . 71 , 1 ] ) , and NFYB ( AUC = 0 . 79 ; 95 % CI = [ 0 . 60 , 0 . 98 ] ) mRNA levels 358 ( Additional files 8 - 10 ) . 359 Page 13 In contrast , HMGN3 was only highlighted by TFEA of the M1 module , correlating with HD 360 in the brain , and not in the blood datasets which may imply that dysregulation of HMGN3 361 may be confined to the brain In R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice , HMGN3 mRNA levels were 362 elevated ( Z - ratios : 1 . 89 , 0 . 78 , 2 . 06 in R6 / 2 ) in HD mice and control and HD mice could be 363 well discriminated based on the HMGN3 mRNA levels . ( AUC = 0 . 89 ; 95 % CI = [ 0 . 76 , 1 ] ) 364 ( Additional files 8 - 10 ) . 365 In concert with a more pronounced HD phenotype in 24 - month YAC128 and R6 / 2 mice than 366 in 12 - month - old YAC128 mice , the increase of HMGN3 , NFYA , and NFYB mRNA levels 367 positively correlated with the age of YAC128 . This raises the possibility that HMGN3 , 368 NFYA , and NFYB mRNA levels might be utilised as markers for disease progression and 369 severity . However , further investigations on the usability of those genes as biomarkers in 370 larger patient cohorts are required . Further , it should be clarified whether alteration of mRNA 371 levels HMGN3 , NFY , their target genes are specific for HD or whether they are present in 372 other neurodegenerative diseases . 373 DLX1 and PRMT3 mRNA levels , which were both also highlighted by TFEA , were only 374 elevated in the striatum of R6 / 2 mice but appeared to be unaffected in YAC128 mice . Like in 375 the brain samples of HD patients , we observed a robust downregulation of DNMT3A ( Z - 376 ratios : - 1 . 24 , - 1 . 79 , - 1 . 14 ) in the striatum of R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice and the mice could be 377 discriminated based on DNMT3A levels ( AUC = 0 . 83 ; 95 % CI = [ 0 . 66 , 0 . 99 ] ) . In 378 disagreement with the analysis of brain samples from HD patients , DNMT1 and DNMT3B 379 levels were not consistently altered in the striatum of R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice . 380 Further corroborating the importance of CDC42 dysregulation in HD , CDC42 mRNA levels 381 were elevated in the striatum of R6 / 2 and YAC128 ( Z - ratios : 1 . 24 , 1 . 18 , 1 . 88 ) . Additionally , 382 control and HD mice could be discriminated based on CDC42 mRNA levels ( AUC = 0 . 85 ; 383 95 % CI = [ 0 . 68 , 1 ] ) . mRNA level of PAK1 , that was identified as a hub gene in the M1 384 subnetwork and correlated with HD , was merely elevated in YAC128 mice ( Z - ratios : 1 . 47 , 385 2 . 08 ) , but was mostly unaffected in R6 / 2 mice ( Z - ratio : - 0 . 45 ) . 386 Discussion 387 In our meta - analysis , we intended to identify by RRA , WGCNA and network analysis robust 388 transcriptomic changes underlying HD . To this end , we included transcriptomic studies 389 analysing different human brain regions and tissues from symptomatic and prodromal HD 390 patients . Thereby , we identified subnetworks of 320 ( M1 ) or 118 ( MB ) genes with robustly 391 Page 14 altered mRNA levels in the brain and blood of HD patients , respectively . Network analysis of 392 differentially expressed genes in the brain highlighted CDC42 , PAK1 , YWHAH , and PP2CA 393 as hub genes of the M1 subnetwork . In the blood , we identified a subnetwork of 118 genes , 394 including genes coding for several constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex that is activated by 395 CDC42 . TFEA highlighted the relevance of several already described ( e . g . CREB1 and NFY ) 396 or novel ( e . g . DLX1 , PRMT3 and HMGN3 ) transcription factors that may play a role in HD . 397 In conclusion , our analysis suggests that dysregulation of transcription factors and epigenetic 398 modifiers , cellular metabolism , actin cytoskeleton and SNARE complex proteins play an 399 important role in the pathology of HD ( Figure 8 ) . 400 As noted before , the pathology of HD is neither confined to certain brain regions nor the brain 401 ( van der Burg et al , 2009 ) . A good HD therapy should , therefore , target a gene or protein that 402 is not exclusively altered in a certain brain region or tissue . Hence , we analysed RNA data 403 from different brain regions and blood samples in our meta - analysis , although an increased 404 interstudy variability , reducing the sensitivity with which differentially expressed genes are 405 identified , may argue against the combined analysis of different brain regions . Furthermore , 406 certain limitations for the interpretation and combined analysis of transcriptomic data from 407 different studies should be considered : although authors of the original publications strictly 408 controlled RNA quality before RNA sequencing or microarray analysis , small changes in 409 RNA quality might impair transcript quantification and subsequently also the results of this 410 meta - analysis . Second , post - mortem samples from HD and healthy controls can only provide 411 insights into transcriptional changes at the end stage of HD that do not necessarily reflect 412 changes at disease onset or during disease progression . Third , neurodegeneration in the brain 413 of HD patients in late disease stages poses the risk that some of the observed alterations are 414 caused by changes in tissue composition . Bearing the danger of altered tissue composition as 415 a confounding factor in mind , we also included the dataset from Agus et al . 2019 who 416 analysed early - stage , prodromal HD patients in which neuronal loss was less pronounced 417 ( Agus et al , 2019 ) . 418 Several studies have shown that HTT and its interactors such as the huntingtin - associated 419 protein 1 ( HAP1 ) or the huntingtin - interacting protein 1 ( HIP1 ) participate in protein transport 420 and the organisation of the cytoskeleton ( Saudou & Humbert , 2016 ) . RNAi - mediated 421 silencing of the huntingtin - interacting protein 1 related ( HIP1R ) , also known as huntingtin - 422 interacting protein 12 ( HIP12 ) , for instance , led to the stable association of clathrin - coated 423 structures and their endocytic cargo to dynamin , actin , the Arp2 / 3 complex , and cortactin 424 ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ; Le Clainche et al , 2007 ) . Furthermore , HAP1 regulates 425 Page 15 synaptic vesicle exocytosis ( Mackenzie et al , 2016 ) and neuronal endocytosis through its 426 interaction with the Sec23 homolog A , COPII coat complex component ( SEC23A ) and the 427 clathrin light chain B ( Mackenzie et al , 2017 ) . In line with previous findings that HTT and its 428 interactors regulate the cytoskeleton and transport processes and substantiating that 429 impairments of these functions contribute to the pathophysiology of HD , we identified 430 CDC42 as a hub gene in the M1 subnetwork that was highly correlated with HD in 431 transcriptomic studies of post - mortem brain samples . Moreover , CDC42 mRNA levels were 432 elevated in the brain of HD patients and in the striatum of R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice . Besides , 433 mRNA levels of several constituents of the Arp2 / Arp3 complex ( ACTR2 / Arp2 : blood ; 434 ACTR3 / Arp3 : blood and brain ; ACTR3B : brain ; ARPC5 : blood ; ACTR6 : brain ) , that 435 interacts with the HIP1R - cortactin complex and is activated by CDC42 , were altered in HD 436 patients . mRNA levels of VAMP1 , an indirect CDC42 interactor , were robustly upregulated 437 in all studies using HD brain samples ( Additional file 1 ) . mRNA levels of VAMP2 and 438 VAMP7 were additionally altered in the HD blood samples ( Additional file 1 ) , although these 439 alterations were not consistent across the different studies . VAMPs are major constituents of 440 protein complexes involved in the docking and fusion of vesicles ( Jena , 2011 ) . These 441 complexes are comprised of VAMPs , other syntaxins , the synaptosome associated protein 25 442 ( SNAP - 25 ) , the N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor - like protein ( NSF ) , the NSF - attachment 443 proteins alpha ( NAPA , SNAPA ) , beta ( NAPB / SNAPB ) , gamma ( NAPG / SNPAG ) , and 444 SNAP receptors ( SNARE ) . Corroborating our finding that the mRNA levels of VAMPs were 445 altered in the brain and blood of HD patients and the striatum of R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice ( this 446 study ) , VAMP2 protein levels were also increased in striatal synaptosomes of Hdh140Q / 140Q 447 mice ( Valencia et al , 2013 ) . Contrary , protein levels of other proteins involved in the docking 448 and fusion of vesicles such as SNAP - 25 or rabphilin 3a were reduced in the post - mortem 449 cortex of HD patients ( Smith et al , 2007 ) . Additionally , analysis of 175Q - HTT knock - in mice 450 demonstrated altered levels of other proteins involved in synaptic function ( SNAP - 25 , 451 Rab3A , and PSD95 ) , axonal transport , and microtubules ( dynein , dynactin , and KIF3A ) 452 ( Smith et al , 2014 ) . Additionally , HTT can interact with SNAP25 , and the SNAP25 - 453 associated proteins syntaxin 1A ( STX1A ) and calcium voltage - gated channel auxiliary 454 subunit alpha2delta 1 ( CACNA2D1 ) ( Kaltenbach et al , 2007 ) . Raising the possibility that 455 HTT and its abundant interactor , the huntingtin - associated protein 40 ( HAP40 ) , plays a role in 456 docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles , we previously found that constituents of this 457 complex , the N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment proteins alpha ( NAPA , SNAPA ) , 458 beta ( NAPB / SNAPB ) , and gamma ( NAPG / SNPAG ) are the closest homologs of HAP40 459 Page 16 ( Seefelder et al , 2020 ) . 460 Besides proteins of the SNARE complex , we identified other proteins linked with CDC42 in 461 our network analysis of transcriptomic data from brain tissue of HD patients . For instance , 462 PAK1 , identified as a hub gene in the subnetwork M1 , and its interactor PAK1IP1 showed 463 robust upregulation in HD patients . The PAK proteins , PAK1 and PAK3 , are central 464 regulators of neuronal development and activating PAK1 mutations were aetiologic for 465 secondary macrocephaly , developmental delay , ataxic gait and seizures in two unrelated 466 patients ( Harms et al , 2018 ) . Double knock - out of PAK1 / PAK3 in mice affected brain size 467 and structure ( Huang et al , 2011 ) . Linking PAKs with HTT , Luo and Rubinszstein showed a 468 physical interaction between HTT and PAK1 ( Luo & Rubinsztein , 2009 ) and siRNA - 469 mediated silencing of PAK1 and PAK2 reduced mutant HTT toxicity and aggregation ( Luo et 470 al , 2008 ; Luo & Rubinsztein , 2009 ) . PAK2 knock - down in the murine striatal cell line 471 STHdh ( Q111 ) also reduced mutant HTT toxicity ( Tourette et al , 2014 ) . 472 As afore - mentioned , we found that 78 % of the genes of the subnetwork MB , which strongly 473 correlated with HD in the blood ( Figure 6 ) , were directly or indirectly regulated by CREB1 474 ( Additional files 6 and 7 ) . CREB1 , a leucine zipper transcription factor , activates the 475 transcription of genes upon binding to the cAMP - response element ( CRE ) . Steffan et al . 476 previously showed that the CREB1 - binding protein ( CBP ) , a transcriptional coactivator of 477 CREB1 , can interact with HTT ( Steffan et al , 2000 ) . In a transcriptomic study of 478 subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained from HD patients , CREB1 target genes were enriched , 479 and the CREB1 mRNA levels were significantly increased ( McCourt et al , 2015 ) . 480 Substantiating the physiological importance of CREB1 , the double knock - out of CREB - 1 and 481 the cAMP - responsive element modulator ( CREM ) in mice ( Creb1 Nescre Crem - / - ) led to severe 482 neuronal loss during brain development and perinatal death ( Mantamadiotis et al , 2002 ) . A 483 conditional , postnatal knock - out of Creb1 and Crem , showed considerable atrophy in the 484 striatum and hippocampus and a dystonic phenotype ( Mantamadiotis et al , 2002 ) . Indicating 485 that the loss - of - function of CREB1 in mice can partly be compensated by CREM , neither the 486 loss of CREB1 nor CREM alone induced neurodegeneration in mice ( Mantamadiotis et al , 487 2002 ) . While we also found a strong enrichment of CREB1 target genes in our MB 488 subnetwork by TFEA , CREB1 mRNA levels appeared to be unaltered in all analysed datasets . 489 As afore - mentioned , TFEA of the M1 subnetwork consisting of genes with robustly altered 490 mRNA levels in the brain of HD patients did not highlight CREB1 . The finding that CREB1 491 targets were not enriched in the M1 subnetwork ( Additional file 6 ) in combination with the 492 data from Mantamadiotis et al . , raises the possibility that CREB1 function may be affected in 493 Page 17 the brain of HD patients , but the CREB1 dysfunction is compensated by CREM or other 494 transcription factors . In contrast , CREB1 dysfunction might not be compensated outside the 495 brain due to the lack of detectable CREM protein expression in blood cells ( Uhlén et al , 496 2015 ) . Another transcription factor whose transcription is controlled by CREB1 and whose 497 target genes were enriched in the MB subnetwork is SP3 . The dual treatment of R6 / 2 mice 498 with mithramycin , inhibiting SP3 , and cystamine reduced the hypertrimethylation of histone 499 H3 and extended their overall survival over 40 % ( Ryu et al , 2006 ) . The alteration of the 500 activity or mRNA levels of CREB1 might also partly explain observed alterations in mRNA 501 levels of CDC42 and constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( this meta - analysis ) since CREB can 502 regulate their transcription . 503 The TFEA , performed in this study , also highlighted the enrichment of NFY target genes in 504 the M1 and MB subnetwork as well as in the dataset of genes affected in both tissues . In the 505 brain of HD patients , mRNA levels of NFYB and its target genes were elevated ( Figure 5 , 506 Additional file 7 ) . Further corroborating that the dysregulation of NFY and its target genes 507 may be important in HD , van Hagen et al . found an enrichment of NFY target genes among a 508 gene cluster that was differentially expressed in rat PC12 cells expressing the exon 1 of 509 human 74Q - HTT ( van Hagen et al , 2017 ) . Aggregates of mutant HTT can interact in vitro and 510 in the mouse brain with NFY and thereby reduce transcription of the NFY target gene HSP70 511 ( Yamanaka et al , 2008 ) . On the other hand , our meta - analysis may indicate that the 512 transcriptional activity and transcription of NFY might be increased in the brain of HD 513 patients , R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice . With regards to the currently available data on the role of 514 NFY in HD , we cannot exclude the possibility that elevated mRNA levels of NFY and its 515 target genes are caused by a compensatory mechanism to restore NFY function . This scenario 516 may explain why transcription of NFY targets was reduced in one study ( Yamanaka et al , 517 2008 ) , while we observed increased transcription of NFY and its targets . 518 Besides NFY and CREB - 1 , TFEA ( Additional file 6 ) of the M1 subnetwork of genes altered 519 in the brain of HD patients highlighted DLX1 , PRMT3 , and HMGN3 that may be involved in 520 astrocyte maturation ( Lee et al , 2003 ) . To our knowledge , this is the first study which 521 indicates a potential role of DLX1 , PRMT3 , and HMGN3 dysfunction in HD . As noted 522 above , DLX1 mRNA levels were only upregulated in the brain of HD patients in two studies , 523 while it appeared to be unaffected in the third study analysing the caudate nucleus of 524 prodromal HD patients . Additionally , DLX - 1 mRNA levels were elevated in the striatum of 525 R6 / 2 mice , while it was unaltered in the striatum of YAC128 mice . Besides the role of DLX1 526 in the adult brain , DLX1 plays also an important role in brain development ; DLX1 , together 527 Page 18 with NOLZ - 1 and DLX2 , regulates the migration of striatal neurones to the dorsal or ventral 528 striatum and the identity of striatal projection neurones ( Chen et al , 2020 ) . Chen et al . also 529 demonstrated that the knock - out of NOLZ - 1 , also known as zinc finger protein 503 530 ( ZNF503 ) , in mice led to an upregulation of DLX1 / 2 and an aberrant neuronal migration from 531 the dorsal to the ventral striatum ( Chen et al , 2020 ) . Demonstrating that elevated 532 DLX1 / DLX2 levels were causative for the aberrant neuronal migration , restoration of the 533 altered DLX1 / DLX2 levels in NOLZ - 1 knock - out mice rescued the aberrant neuronal 534 migration ( Chen et al , 2020 ) . A conditional DLX1 knock - out in cortical interneurons in mice 535 reduced the excitatory input , fewer excitatory synapses and hypoplastic dendrites ( Pla et al , 536 2018 ) which substantiated on the relevance of DLX1 beyond the striatum . Additionally , 537 DLX1 knock - down in interneurons enhanced dendritic growth through neuropilin - 2 and 538 PAK3 ( Dai et al , 2014 ) , that was also slightly upregulated in the brain of HD patients ( Z - 539 ratios : 1 . 98 ; 0 . 46 ; 0 . 70 ) according to this meta - analysis . PRMT3 , a protein methyltransferase 540 whose mRNA levels were elevated in the brain of HD patients and the striatum of R6 / 2 mice 541 ( this study ) but neither in the blood nor the striatum of YAC128 mice , is essential for 542 dendritic spine maturation in the rat hippocampus ( Miyata et al , 2010 ) and neuronal 543 development ( Ikenaka et al , 2006 ) . Due to a more rapid disease progression and disease onset 544 in R6 / 2 than YAC128 mice ( Menalled et al , 2009 ; Farshim & Bates , 2018 ) , the elevation of 545 DLX - 1 and PRMT3 mRNA levels in the striatum of R6 / 2 but not in YAC128 mice raises the 546 possibility that the dysregulation of DLX - 1 and PRMT3 occurs in later disease stages and is 547 more pronounced upon expression of the HTT - exon1 fragment . 548 Conclusion 549 Here , we identified , by RRA and WGCNA , subnetworks of 320 ( M1 ) and118 ( MB ) genes 550 with robustly altered mRNA levels in the brain and blood of HD patients , resp . In the brain , 551 CDC42 , PAK1 , YWHAH , and PP2CA were highlighted as hub genes of the M1 subnetwork 552 ( Additional file 4 ) , that appears to be enriched in genes functioning in protein transport 553 ( Figure 3 ) . Additionally , in the blood , we identified a subnetwork of 118 genes , including 554 genes coding for several constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex that is activated by CDC42 . 555 TFEA ( Figure 5 and Additional file 6 ) highlighted the relevance of CREB1 in the pathology 556 of HD since the transcription of 78 . 0 % of genes altered in the blood of HD patients were 557 directly or indirectly regulated by CREB1 . Furthermore , DLX1 , PRMT3 , HMGN3 and NFY 558 target genes were enriched in the identified modules . HMGN3 , NFYA , NFYB , and CDC42 559 mRNA levels were additionally altered in R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice ( Additional file 8 ) and 560 Page 19 could be used to discriminate between control and HD mice ( Additional files 9 and 10 ) . 561 Indicating that the upregulation of DLX1 and PRMT3 transcription may occur in later disease 562 stages , DLX - 1 and PRMT3 mRNA levels were merely elevated in R6 / 2 mice but not in 563 YAC128 mice that show a less severe HD phenotype than R6 / 2 mice . 564 Our results strongly suggest that abnormal protein transport , cytoskeletal organization , and 565 transcriptional regulation might be central features in the pathophysiology of HD ( figure 8 ) . 566 Furthermore , our study substantiates the role of CDC42 , previously identified HTT interactors 567 ( e . g . PAK1 , and PAK2 ) and transcriptional regulators ( e . g . CREB1 and NFY ) which have 568 been reported to be sequestered to mutant HTT aggregates . Most interestingly , our data 569 indicate a potential pathophysiological role of DLX - 1 , HMGN3 and PRMT3 in HD that have 570 not been reported before . 571 Methods 572 Retrieval and tiding of datasets 573 In our meta - analysis , we analysed transcriptomic studies that were published in a peer - 574 reviewed journal and whose raw data were publicly available . Furthermore , we excluded 575 transcriptomic studies with less than eight samples from HD patients . To analyse post - mortem 576 brain tissue , we retrieved data from the Gene Ontology Omnibus ( GEO ) database of the 577 National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) with the accession number GSE33000 578 ( Narayanan et al , 2014 ) , GSE129473 ( Agus et al , 2019 ) , and GSE64810 ( Labadorf et al , 579 2015 ) . Additionally , for the analysis of blood samples from HD patients , raw data were 580 retrieved from the GEO database with the accession numbers GSE1751 ( Borovecki et al , 581 2005 ) , GSE24250 ( Hu et al , 2011 ) ( Hu et al , 2011 ) , and GSE8762 ( Runne et al , 2007 ) . If 582 genes were measured by several probes , the average of all probes for the respective genes was 583 used . In our meta - analysis , we excluded the samples from presymptomatic HD patients due to 584 a low patient number . 585 Missing data in the dataset GSE33000 were imputed by sequential and random hot - deck 586 imputation as implement in the R - package VIM ( Kowarik & Templ , 2016 ) since we assumed 587 missing at random after graphical analysis of missing values by the R - function matrixplot 588 ( VIM package ) ( Templ et al , 2012 ) . We normalised raw transcript - levels by quantile - 589 normalisation using the R function normalize . quantiles . robust from the package 590 preprocessCore ( Bolstad , 2019 ) and , afterwards , converted them into Z - Scores . 591 Page 20 Robust rank aggregation analysis ( RRA ) 592 For the robust rank aggregation ( RRA ) , we computed Z - ratios according to the method 593 proposed by Cheadle et al . , 2003 ( Cheadle et al , 2003 ) and ranked them after their absolute Z - 594 ratio . The sorted transcript lists were analysed with RRA , as implemented in the R package 595 RobustRankAggreg ( Kolde et al , 2012 ) . We included transcripts with a score < 0 . 05 in the 596 further downstream analysis and performed clustering analysis and plotting of the heatmaps 597 with the function heatmap . 2 implemented in the R - package gplots ( version 3 . 0 . 3 ) ( Warnes et 598 al , 2020 ) . 599 Generation of weighted correlation networks 600 For the weighted correlation network analysis ( WGCNA ) , the signed co - expression networks 601 were build using the R - package WGCNA ( Langfelder & Horvath , 2008 ) . Correlation between 602 genes was computed by biweight midcorrelation ( Langfelder & Horvath , 2008 ) to compute 603 adjacency matrices . Based on the scale - free criterion ( Zhang & Horvath , 2005 ) , we set the 604 power parameter β and computed the topological overlap measure ( TOM ) and the 605 corresponding dissimilarity matrices ( 1 – TOM ) . Genes were clustered by model - based 606 clustering of the dissimilarity matrix as implemented by Scrucca et al . 2016 ( Scrucca et al , 607 2016 ) . Correlation of module eigengenes with disease state and between gene significance 608 and module membership were calculated by Pearson’s product - moment correlation as 609 implemented in R ( Langfelder et al , 2008 ; R Core Team , 2020 ) . We adjusted p - values for 610 multiple testing with the method described by Yekutieli & Benjamini , 2001 ( Yekutieli & 611 Benjamini , 2001 ) . Genes with a gene significance score above 0 . 3 , module membership above 612 0 . 7 , and intramodular connectivity that is larger than the 8th percentile of all genes were 613 identified as hubs . 614 Enrichment Analysis 615 Gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) was conducted with the algorithm implemented in the 616 STRING database ( Szklarczyk et al , 2019 ) for each dataset separately and results were 617 combined by ranking enriched terms after their enrichment scores and aggregation by RRA 618 ( Kolde et al , 2012 ) . Gene ontology ( GO ) and Reactome term enrichment of genes from 619 different subnetworks were performed with the algorithms implemented by the STRING 620 database ( Szklarczyk et al , 2019 ) in Cytoscape ( version 3 . 7 . 2 ) ( Shannon et al , 2003 ) . 621 Based on the pathway annotations in the KEGG database ( Kanehisa & Goto , 2000 ) and the 622 protein - protein interaction data from STRING ( version 11 . 0 ) ( Szklarczyk et al , 2019 ) , we 623 Page 21 performed a network enrichment analysis test ( NEAT ) ( Signorelli et al , 2016 ) as implemented 624 in the R package ´neat´ . Transcription factor enrichment analysis ( TFEA ) was performed with 625 ChIP - X Enrichment Analysis 3 ( CheA3 ) ( Keenan et al , 2019 ) using the mean rank as the 626 metric . Furthermore , we calculated the mean Z - ratios of transcription factor targets with R - 627 scripting language ( R Core Team , 2020 ) and plotted the results using ggplot2 ( Wickham , 628 2016 ) . 629 Network analysis 630 Protein - protein interaction networks ( PPIN ) were retrieved from the STRING database 631 ( Szklarczyk et al , 2019 ) using a confidence level cut - off of 0 . 4 and the Cytoscape software 632 ( version 3 . 7 . 2 ) ( Shannon et al , 2003 ) . Top 50 hubs of the PPIN were computed with the 633 cytoHubba plug - in ( Chin et al , 2014 ) using the betweenness , bottleneck , closeness , clustering 634 coefficient , degree , DMNC , EcCentricity , EPC , MCC , radiality and stress scoring methods . 635 Results of different scoring methods were aggregated by RRA ( Kolde et al , 2012 ) to increase 636 the robustness of the prediction . We included hub proteins with an RRA score below 0 . 05 in 637 the further analysis and combined the lists of hubs in the co - expression network , identified by 638 WGNA , and the protein - protein interaction network by RRA ( Kolde et al , 2012 ) . 639 Confirmation of hub genes in HD mouse models 640 We analysed two datasets with transcriptomic data of HD mouse models to confirm if the 641 identified hub genes and transcriptional regulators were additionally altered in independent 642 datasets . In these studies , transcriptomic alterations in the striatum of R6 / 2 ( Miyazaki et al , 643 2020 ) ( NCBI accession number : GSE113929 ) or YAC128 ( NCBI accession number : 644 GSE19677 ) ( Becanovic et al , 2010 ) were analysed . Since Becanovic et al . 2010 used 645 YAC128 mice at the age of 12 and 24 months , we separated the samples according to the age 646 of mice and analysed them as independent datasets . Data tidying and computation of Z - ratios 647 were performed as described in the sections “retrieval and tiding of datasets” and “Robust 648 rank aggregation analysis ( RRA ) ” . 649 Classification analysis of selected genes ( ACTR2 , ACTR3 , ARPC5 , CDC42 , CREB1 , DLX1 , 650 DNMT1 , DNMT3A , DNMT3B , HDAC2 , HDAC5 , HMGN3 , NFYA , NFYB , NFYC , PAK1 , 651 PRMT3 , VAMP2 , VAMP7 , YWHAH , ZDHHC13 , ZDHHC17 ) , identified in the human 652 datasets , was performed , as implemented in the R - package pROC ( Robin et al , 2011 ) , to 653 compute the area under the curve ( AUC ) of the respective receiver - operator characteristics 654 ( ROC ) . 95 % confidence intervals of AUCs were calculated by bootstrapping with 10 , 000 655 replicates and genes with confidence intervals for the AUC above 0 . 5 were considered 656 Page 22 capable to discriminate between control and HD mice since the classification model is 657 statistically significantly better than a random classification model . 658 Acknowledgements 659 We acknowledge funding of this work by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ( DFG , 660 German Research Foundation – project number 412854449 ) .
