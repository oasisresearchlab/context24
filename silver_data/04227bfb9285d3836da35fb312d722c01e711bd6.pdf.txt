Some studies sought to evaluate whether a consequence of immune response is oxidative stress . In a meta - analysis of 16 studies of ten species of birds including 49 estimates of effect size from experimental studies , we show that induction of an immune response in a diverse group of bird species may determine oxidative stress ( variance explained : 4 . 1 % ) , but , most notably , may determine changes in oxidative stress markers ( variance explained : 15 . 0 % ) . These conclusions were robust to control for sampling effort and publication bias . Finally , this ﬁ nding suggests that ( 1 ) oxidative stress may be a physiological cost associated with the immune response and ( 2 ) an important role of antioxidants in birds is to control the potentially negative effects of such oxidative stress to prevent immuno - pathological damage to host tissues . © 2009 Elsevier Inc .

Birds are in fact faced with the dilemma of investing suf ﬁ ciently to mount an effective immune response , but not too much to avoid depletion of energy reserves and pathological side - effects caused by an elevated immune response . This problem of optimizing immune responses may be relevant , for example , for the relationship between life history decisions and parasitism given the trade - off between investment in life history traits ( e . g . , clutch size , rate of aging ) and immunity ( Sheldon and Verhulst , 1996 ; Norris and Evans , 2000 ) . Another important factor that might modulate investment in immune response is the oxidative stress that is potentially associated with the immune response itself ( Fig . 1 ) . Oxidative stress arises from the imbalance between pro - oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the former , leading to the generation of oxidative damage ( Sies , 1991 ; Halliwell and Gutteridge , 2007 ) . Oxidative stress is an important factor underlying reproductive performance , cellular senescence and aging , and so is an important ﬁ tness - related trait ( Beckman and Ames , 1998 ; Hulbert et al . , 2007 ) . Recent studies show that levels of pro - oxidants and antioxidants may also have relevant ecological and evolutionary roles and may help understand functional interactions among life history traits ( von Schantz et al . , 1999 ; Costantini , 2008 ; Monaghan et al . , 2009 ) . Part of the immune response relies on immune cells that kill pathogens by releasing pro - oxidant compounds . Professional phago - cytes ( macrophages , eosinophils , heterophils ) , as well as B and T lymphocytes contain a multi - component enzyme complex , the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase ( Hampton et al . , 1998 ; Babior , 1999 ) . This enzyme complex is responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species after immune stimulation . At the onset of an immune response , phagocytes increase their oxygen uptake as much as 10 – 20 times the resting values ( respiratory burst ) . The NADPH oxidase is oxidized into NADP + , releasing two electrons , which are used to reduce oxygen to superoxide free radical : NADPH + 2O 2 Y NADP + + H + + 2O • − : The O • − generated by this enzyme serves as the starting material for the production of a suite of reactive species ( Fig . 1 ) . Direct evidence indicates that immune cells also release other powerful pro - oxidants , such as hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) , hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ) , peroxynitrite ( ONOO − ) and , possibly , hydroxyl ( OH • ) and ozone ( O 3 ) . Independent evidence shows that pathogens with impaired antioxidant defenses are more sensitive to phagocytic killing , indicating a role for reactive oxygen species as microbicidal agents ( Halliwell and Gutteridge , 2007 ) . Further studies show that indivi - duals de ﬁ cient in oxidase are susceptible to severe bacterial and fungal infections ( Nathan and Shiloh , 2000 ) . Reactive species are important in killing pathogens , but can as a negative side effect also damage host tissues ( immuno - pathology ) . This is particularly evident during chronic in ﬂ ammation , which may cause extensive tissue oxidative damage with a consequent increase in oxidative stress ( Sorci and Faivre , 2009 ) . Recent studies on captive and wild birds ( Table 1 ) have investigated the effects of immune response on oxidative stress markers , yielding contrasting results .

Here , we review this recent evidence , perform a meta - analysis to test the hypothesis that “ immune response increases oxidative stress ” , and try to reconcile the contrasting results of these studies . We will focus on birds because , compared to other taxa , the link between avian immune response and changes in oxidative stress markers has been widely studied ; birds have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to mitigate detrimental effects of oxidative stress ( Costantini , 2008 ) ; and birds have been excellent subjects in many areas of biological research ( Konishi et al . , 1989 ) . 2 . Material and methods A systematic search of research investigating the effects of immune response on oxidative stress markers was conducted by accessing several sources ( e . g . , PubMed ) and by checking the literature quoted in each article addressing this issue . In this paper , we review 16 studies for a total number of 49 effect size estimates of immune response on oxidative stress markers ( Appendix ) . All studies on nitrosative stress were not considered because of the differences in biochemical roles between reactive oxygen and nitrogen species . For each study , we calculated effect size from test statistics reported in the original papers by using the equations given by Rosenthal ( 1991 , 1994 : Table 16 . 1 ) . For analyses of variance we used the F - value for the contrast of interest to estimate effect size , as suggested by R . Rosenthal . In a hypothetical example for four groups with a predicted linear trend in four mean values , we have weights of − 3 , − 1 , + 1 , and + 3 associated with four means of 2 , 5 , 7 , and 8 . The correlation coef ﬁ cient ( r alerting ) between contrast weights and means is 0 . 976 and r 2alerting is 0 . 952 . If we assume an omnibus F ( with 3 d . f . in the numerator ) of 2 . 0 , then we get F for contrast ( an F with 1 d . f . in the numerator ) from : F contrast = F omnibus × d : f : numerator × r 2alerting : In the present example we get 2 . 0×3×0 . 952 = 5 . 71 . From F contrast we get r contrast from r contrast = M F contrast ð Þ = F contrast + d : f : error ð Þ = M 5 : 71 = 5 : 71 + 36 ð Þ = 0 : 37 ; assuming that n = 10 for each of the four groups . In a ﬁ rst analysis , the sign of each effect size was considered to be positive when oxidative damage was increased and antioxidants were decreased after immune stimulation , but was negativewhen oxidative damage was decreased and antioxidants increased after immune stimulation . This allowed us to evaluate effects of immune response on oxidative stress . In a second analysis , all the effect sizes were assigned the same sign . This allowed us to evaluate to what extent the immune response determines changes in oxidative status markers , regardless of whether this causes or does not cause oxidative stress . The measure of effect size used in the meta - analyses was Pearson ' s correlation coef ﬁ cient . Pearson ' s correlation coef ﬁ cients were subse - quently transformed by means of Fisher ' s transformation to z - values on which subsequent analyses were performed . This measure of effect size was adjusted for sample size using N − 3 as an adjustment factor ( Rosenthal , 1991 , pp . 27 – 28 ) , based on the assumption that a larger sample size should provide a more reliable estimate of the unknown true relationship . We calculated an overall effect using mean effect size adjusted for sample size after z - transformation . The mean weighted z r values were tested against the null hypothesis of no effect by examining the signi ﬁ cance of their associated r ' s . This was done by back - transforming the mean weighted effect size to a correlation coef ﬁ cient and testing the signi ﬁ cance of this coef ﬁ cient given the total sample size ( Rosenthal , 1991 ) . An estimate of heterogeneity in effect sizes among samples was subsequently calculated using the formula provided by Rosenthal ( 1991 , pp . 73 – 74 ) , which has a χ 2 - distribution with K − 1 degrees of freedom , where K is the number of analysis units . There are both direct and indirect ways of estimating publication bias ( Møller and Jennions , 2004 ) . Given that direct estimates would require knowledge about studies initiated , but never published , we were unable to pursue this approach . Instead , we estimated the fail - safe number as the number of unpublished null studies needed to eliminate the observed global effect size . We obtained that estimate by relying on the equations reported by Rosenthal ( 1991 , p . 104 ) . 3 .

Overall effect size for this test was small to intermediate , explaining 4 . 1 % of the variance . There was statistically highly signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity in effect size among estimates ( Table 1 ) . The fail - safe number was 95 studies ( Table 1 ) . For the second test of whether immune response affected oxidative status markers , we found an intermediate to large effect , explaining 15 . 0 % of the variance . Again , there was signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity in effect size among studies ( Table 1 ) . The fail - safe number was 95 studies ( Table 1 ) . To be conservative we made a second set of meta - analyses based on mean estimates for species , summing sample sizes for the different tests to achieve estimates weightedbysample size . This analysis based on ten species revealed Pearson ' s product – moment correlations of 0 . 2042 and 0 . 4392 , respectively , both highly signi ﬁ cant ( p b 0 . 001 ) . There was signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity among species ( χ 2 = 152 . 15 and 212 . 34 , respectively , d . f . = 9 , p b 0 . 001 ) . The fail - safe numbers were 71 and 195 , respectively . 4 . Discussion The main ﬁ ndings of the present study were that mean effect size for the relationship between immune response and oxidative stress was small to intermediate , but highly signi ﬁ cant . In a second analysis , we showed that oxidative status markers were affected by immune response with an effect size that was intermediate to large . There was signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity in effect sizes for both analyses . The number of unpublished studies with null effects needed to nullify the recorded effectswaslargerthanthenumberofstudiesreviewed , suggestingthat it is unlikely that the ﬁ ndings could be eliminated by publication bias . We found an intermediate effect of immune response on oxidative stress , with a Pearson ' s correlation coef ﬁ cient weighted by sample size of 0 . 20 . This weak to intermediate effect ( sensu Cohen , 1988 ) was highly signi ﬁ cant . The effect could not readily be explained as a result of publication bias because an extraordinarily large number of null results had to exist in order to eliminate the overall effect size . We consider it out of the question that almost six times as many unpublished studies should exist compared to the 16 published ones . That is particularly the case with the mixed results of previously published studies . There was clear evidence of heterogeneity among effect size estimates . There was an intermediate to strong effect ( sensu Cohen , 1988 ) of immune response on oxidative status markers . There was consider - ably less heterogeneity for this than for the previous effect , suggesting that immune responses had strong , general impact on oxidative status markers . We have previously shown in a meta - analysis that carotenoids are unlikely to act as main antioxidants in birds ( Costantini and Møller , 2008 ) . Here we suggest that this ﬁ nding can be reconciled with the ﬁ ndings reported here , if carotenoids mainly act as immuno - stimulating and immuno - modulating biochemicals ( e . g . , Bendich , 1989 ; Chew , 1993 ; Haq et al . , 1996 ; Jyonouchi et al . , 1994 , 1995 ; Kim et al . , 2000 ; McWhinney and Bailey , 1989 ; Olson and Owens , 1998 ; Tengerdy et al . , 1990 ; van Poppel et al . , 1993 ; Watson et al . , 1991 ) , while vitamins A and E and other fat - soluble antioxidants mainly act as free - radical scavengers ( e . g . , Surai , 2002 ; Hartley and Kennedy , 2004 ) . Such dual roles for these two groups of biochemicals could help explain their positive covariation within and among species , because the consequences of high levels of immuno - stimulation or immuno - modulation by carotenoids for immune response would later be partly neutralized by the effects of antioxidants , thereby preventing immuno - pathological damage to host tissues . In fact , enhanced immune cell activity can overproduce free radicals , and antioxidant protection in this case may be vital ( Gille and Sigler , 1995 ; Jaeschke , 1995 ) . In this context , it is worth mentioning that reactive oxygen species released during the immune response may also play a role in signaling , stimulating the immune response itself . For example , reactive species may facilitate phagocyte adherence to endothelium or stimulate synthesis of cytokines ( Halliwell and Gutteridge , 2007 ; Sorci and Faivre , 2009 ) . The effects of reactive oxygen species are likely to be biphasic , that is at low dose they modulate cellular communication , while at high dose they will damage host tissues , as well as immune cells . The redox environment where the immune response is working is also important , that is , the level of antioxidants . Feedback mechanisms between all these components could underlie the complexity of immune response . Part of the heterogeneity between studies could be accounted for by whether the study was based on birds in captivity or in the wild . Effect size was always high in free - living birds , while it was more variable in captive birds . On one hand , this may be explained by either the quality of the diet or the fact that free - living birds cannot readily recover from the costs of an immune response byacquiring more food . On the other , this may mirror the fact that selection lines of captive birds may not be subject to a full complement of natural and sexual selection , emphasizing the need of many replicates . Another factor that may potentially explain some of the hetero - geneity between studies are the methods used to elicit the immune response and to quantify oxidative stress . For example , some studies measured antioxidant capacity only , which may be not suf ﬁ cient to make inferences about oxidative stress ( Costantini and Verhulst , in press ) . Of course , measuring antioxidants is informative in that changes in their levels may give us insight on how the oxidative costs and physiological trade - offs may come about . What is also evident from these studies is that measuringone type of antioxidants maygive us a different picture from that obtained while measuring another one . For example , Pa š ková et al . ( 2008 ) clearly show that levels of two antioxidants , glutathione and glutathione peroxidase , may covary negatively after immuno - stimulation . Similar results emerge from other two studies ( Koinarski et al . , 2005 ; Georgieva et al . , 2006 ) that show how levels of catalase and superoxide dismutase covary negatively after immune challenge . This may depend on the fact that antioxidants can detoxify the biological system in very different ways , for instance , acting at different stages in the oxidative sequence . However , this also suggests that different antioxidants maypotentially lead to different conclusions about the oxidative status of an individual . This is an important issue that future ecological studies should take into account . The capacity of the antioxidant machinery may vary among species , for example depending on the phase of the life cycle ( e . g . , reproductive vs . non - reproductive phase ) or on the age of an individual ( e . g . , nestlings vs . adults ) , which is known to affect both immuno - competence and antioxidant capacity in birds ( e . g . , Costan - tini et al . , 2006 , 2007 ; Lavoie , 2006 ) . Such heterogeneity could mirror different life histories , intensities of sexual selection , histories of parasite - mediated selection , and / or feeding habits , and , conse - quently , different mechanisms that have evolved to cope with immune response - related oxidative stress . Our knowledge about these issues is very limited and the ﬁ ndings reported here may have a number of implications for future studies of immunity and oxidant status of birds and other organisms . We think that this should be a promising ﬁ eld of research for future ecological studies aimed at explaining the diversity of life histories and the trade - offs that birds have to cope with during different stages of their entire life . In this regard , we suggest that future studies should also investigate the dynamics of immune responses and changes in oxidative status markers across a prolonged period in order to understand whether the timing of the response differs between antioxidants and how the oxidative costs associated with the immune response come about . In conclusion , we have shown that induction of an immune response in a diverse group of bird species causes oxidative stress and affects oxidative stress markers . This conclusion seems robust to control for sampling effort and publication bias . Finally , it suggests that an important role of antioxidants is to control the potentially negative effects of such oxidative stress . 341 D . Costantini , A . P .
