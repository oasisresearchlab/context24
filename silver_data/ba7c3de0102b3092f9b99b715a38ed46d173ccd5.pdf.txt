Diversity can promote creativity by exposing individuals to different perspectives and at the same time make it difficult for teams to leverage their differences to be more creative . This paper asserts that through the promotion of cooperation , collectivism will help ideation team members overcome the challenges associated with diversity and promote creativity . To examine this assertion , we conducted an experimental study involving 107 individuals in 33 idea - generation teams . Collectivism was promoted through priming . The results confirm our assertion : collectivism created conditions that facilitated creativity when teams were high in perceived diversity . Collectivism also facilitated more satisfaction among teammates by offsetting negative perceptions of diversity . These results offer new insights on collectivism , perceived diversity and creativity .

Group and Organization Interface : Computer - supported cooperative work INTRODUCTION Ideation is a creative process that involves the generation of new ideas by individuals , teams and organizations [ 9 , 32 ] . Researchers in the computer - supported cooperative work ( CSCW ) and human – computer interaction ( HCI ) communities have been interested in ideation because of its importance in both cooperative work and the design of technology ( e . g . , [ 17 , 32 , 38 , 104 , 105 , 127 ] ) . For example , organizations generate ideas to improve planning [ 5 ] . Engineers brainstorm to come up with alternative solutions to solve technical problems [ 121 ] . Companies rely on design teams to generate ideas for new products and services [ 32 , 36 , 70 ] . CSCW and HCI scholars have developed new technologies to better support creative idea generation . These include BeachMap [ 90 ] , BRIDGE [ 31 ] and GroupMind [ 101 ] , which produce concept / mind maps to help break down and organize problems , as well as Momentum [ 7 ] , which emails textual prompts related to idea topics days before ideation takes place . Other examples include Idea Expander [ 121 ] and DesignLibs [ 10 ] , which provide pictorial or scenario - based stimuli to facilitate creativity . One particular problem CSCW and HCI scholars have sought to address through the design of collaborative systems is the issues associated with diversity and creativity [ 43 , 124 ] . Diversity , defined as individual differences , is a key driver of creativity in teams [ 77 ] . Perceived diversity , which refers to the belief that others are different ( e . g . , in terms of education , ability , and attitude ) [ 45 ] , has been used to explain the negative effects of diversity on creativity ( e . g . , [ 2 , 20 ] ) . Diversity can promote creativity by exposing individuals to different perspectives [ 74 , 77 , 89 , 97 , 102 ] . However , diversity can make it difficult for teams to leverage their differences to be more creative [ 56 , 87 ] . This is because individuals are less likely to share their unique ideas in the presence of others they believe are different from themselves [ 56 , 96 ] . At the same time , in order to exploit the benefits of diversity , team members need to recognize their differences [ 45 , 67 ] . This paradox helps to explain why team diversity is often referred to as a double - edge sword [ 37 , 76 ] . In addressing this issue , CSCW and HCI scholars have explored how priming can be used to design more effective systems to support creativity ( e . g . , [ 41 , 69 ] ) . Priming is a psychological phenomenon where individuals are exposed to a stimulus that can change their subsequent behaviors [ 8 ] . For example , Lewis et al . [ 69 ] primed participants in their study by showing them pictures and found that it increased idea generation . Employing priming to promote collectivism may hold particular promise for diverse ideation teams .

Collectivism has been found to promote teamwork . It has been associated with decreases in free - riding and increases in cooperation and satisfaction in teams ( e . g . , [ 75 , 120 ] ) , all of which have been associated with increases in the number and quality of idea generation by individuals ( e . g . , [ 4 , 12 , 18 , 116 ] ) . Although collectivism can be viewed as a cultural trait [ 73 ] , we do not make this assumption . However , we do draw from the literature on cultural collectivism in teams . In this paper we take a unique view on the relationship between collectivism and creativity . We assert that through the promotion of cooperation , collectivism is likely to help ideation team members overcome the challenges associated with perceived diversity and thus promote creativity . If this hypothesis holds true , perceived diversity should be associated with better ideation results when team members are higher in collectivism . To test this assertion , we conducted a lab experiment with 107 participants in 33 ideation teams . We primed the participants to promote collectivism or reduce collectivism . Our results show that when individuals were primed with higher collectivism , perceived diversity had a much stronger positive relationship with creativity than when individuals were primed with lower collectivism . In addition , we found that collectivism was indirectly related to satisfaction via perceived diversity . This paper offers several contributions to theory . One , in this paper we identify collectivism as one approach to help individuals in ideation teams overcome the problems associated with perceived diversity . CSCW and HCI researchers have long studied the theoretical mechanisms promoting or hindering creativity enabled through technology ( e . g . , [ 99 , 122 ] ) . More specifically , CSCW and HCI scholars have studied ways to promote creativity by investigating conflict , free - riding , cognitive inertia , trust and cultural differences [ 3 , 43 , 54 , 99 , 123 ] . Results of this study extend our understanding of this area . Two , in this paper we extend theory across several disciplines . Previous research has found that collectivism reduces individual creativity in both face - to - face and virtual teams [ 39 , 123 , 124 ] . However , through this study we were the first to our knowledge to identify and explain the conditions under which collectivism can facilitate rather than hinder team creativity . In doing so , this study contributes to scholars across several disciplines studying teamwork to better understand how to promote both creativity and cooperation . This study also contributes to the design of collaborative systems . From a design perspective our results can better inform when we should design systems to promote collectivism or for that matter perceptions of diversity . In doing so , this study speaks directly to designers who have studied or implemented theory - driven mechanisms in collaborative systems ( e . g . , [ 14 , 15 , 35 , 49 , 65 , 92 ] ) . In particular , this study contributes to the CSCW literature on the use of priming in collaborative systems and the literature addressing issues around designing to promote creativity in diverse teams ( e . g . , [ 69 , 124 ] ) . THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Collectivism The concept of collectivism originally stems from cultural studies ( e . g . , [ 52 , 72 ] ) . Collectivism can be defined as a state of mind where individuals see themselves more as a member of group , as opposed to individualism , where individuals view themselves more as apart from the group [ 73 ] . A collectivistic versus individualistic orientation can affect a team member’s self - concept , wellbeing , attribution style , and relationships with others [ 84 ] . While we don’t make assumptions about culture - based differences , we are interested in what happens when people are more collectivistic during group ideation . Previous CSCW research has shown that collectivism can adversely affect individual creativity in teams . A study found that participants who identified as having a more collectivistic orientation were less talkative and responsive during ideation sessions than participants who were more individualistic [ 123 ] . This research complements the work on non - CSCW scholars Goncalo and Staw [ 39 ] , who found that teams high in collectivism were less creative in collocated brainstorming situations than those high in individualism . On the whole , collectivism has been shown to have a negative impact on idea generation in brainstorming teams . Other scholars have explored how technology can be used to decrease the negative effects of collectivism . For example , one study sought to determine whether individuals in teams with a collectivistic majority would behave similarly to each other and , if so , whether these practices would be heightened by the use of rich media such as video [ 122 ] . Both hypotheses were supported . Scholars have also investigated ways to promote creativity in culturally diverse teams ( i . e . collectivistic vs . individualistic cultures ) using technology . For instance , Wang and colleagues [ 124 ] found that the use of task - related pictures in team communication facilitated creativity in mixed teams of collectivistic and individualistic people . Unlike previous studies , we take a different approach to explaining the relationship between collectivism and creativity . Previous researchers have identified the problems associated with collectivism on creativity and sought to find ways to help individuals in teams overcome the difficulties associated with collectivism . In this paper , Session : Teamwork CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 2345 we sought ways to help teams take advantage of collectivism to facilitate creativity in virtual ideation teams . Perceived Diversity Perceived diversity refers to the perception that others are different [ 45 ] . Researchers have traditionally focused on objective diversity ( e . g . , [ 77 , 78 ] ) . A rich set of literature has explored the effect of objective diversity on various team outcomes , such as creativity [ 77 ] and decision - making [ 129 ] . For example , gender and tenure diversity have been found to be positively related to productivity in GitHub teams [ 119 ] . However , the use of objective diversity has several limitations . First , people respond based on their perceptions of reality rather than on objective reality [ 50 ] . Second , individuals can have different perceptions and reactions to the same level of objective diversity [ 53 ] . Therefore , we are less interested in the impacts of “our definition” of objective diversity and more interested in how individuals perceive diversity [ 94 ] . In fact , Zellmer - Bruhn et al . [ 128 ] found that the perception of diversity among teammates mediated the relationship between objective differences and team outcomes . Third , in many cases objective diversity may be less salient in a virtual context compared to a face - to - face context [ 94 ] . Image , voice and context are commonly missing to some extent in technology - mediated interactions . Therefore , individuals in virtual teams using computer - mediated technologies cannot identify their differences directly ; but instead , they develop a perception of differences based on their interactions . Perceived diversity has come to represent the negative impacts of diversity [ 94 , 100 ] . For example , perceived diversity has been found to be negatively related to some task - related processes , such as information exchange [ 40 ] and collaborative decision - making [ 51 ] , and positively related to subgroup formation processes [ 128 ] that lead to group conflict [ 66 ] . Previous researchers have also examined the effect of perceived diversity on satisfaction and team creativity in work teams [ 20 , 102 ] . For example , Cunningham [ 20 ] found in field teams that individuals had less satisfaction and more turnover intention when they perceived themselves to be more different from their coworkers . Shin et al . [ 102 ] found in organizational teams that perceived diversity could be positively related to creativity . The question of perceived diversity is strongly linked with a parallel set of ideas , namely a collectivist versus an individualist orientation to a team as a whole . We assert that the interplay with collectivism and perceived difference is crucial to creativity in virtual ideation teams . Ideation and Brainstorming Brainstorming is a commonly used technique in ideation [ 10 , 32 ] . It is a popular tool to support creativity for both collocated and dispersed teams [ 23 ] . Typically , the goal of a brainstorming session is to have teams generate as many ideas as possible [ 4 , 36 ] — often in response to a challenge . For example , teams may be asked to brainstorm ideas to discover potential threats , identify problems , and come up with coping strategies [ 4 ] . In organizations , group brainstorming has been employed as a mechanism to promote creativity , support organizational memory of solutions , facilitate employees to use and develop skills , and encourage interpersonal bonds among team members [ 1 , 24 , 108 ] . Factors that facilitate or hinder the idea - generation process in brainstorming sessions form the basis of much of the literature in this area ( e . g . , [ 16 , 88 ] ) . Scholars have studied the mechanisms that affect group brainstorming creativity from both the group perspective ( such as group size [ 34 ] , group dispersion [ 4 , 19 , 107 ] and group structure of the entire group versus subgroups [ 26 ] ) and the task - related perspective , such as task structure [ 22 ] . Other researchers have examined the effect of providing and organizing related information on ideation improvement , such as providing scenarios in the system [ 10 ] , using project - specific card - based systems [ 38 ] and displaying previously generated ideas [ 32 ] . Individual and team differences have also been examined [ 25 ] . HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT Based on the research outlined above , we derived a set of hypotheses that links perceived diversity , collectivism and creativity . Collectivism and Perceived Diversity We assert that collectivism is associated with decreases in perceived diversity because this orientation puts more emphasis on the group than the individual [ 112 ] . According to social categorization theory ( e . g . , [ 115 ] ) , the path toward understanding the self in the context of the group involves a process of depersonalization , where people tend to perceive themselves as less different from other members within their group . This makes individual uniqueness less accessible [ 112 ] , which should decrease perceived diversity . Collectivism emphasizes fitting in with the group , and prior research suggests that when this occurs individuals see other team members as more similar to themselves [ 115 ] . In all , collectivism leads many to perceive their group members as less diverse . H1 : Members of idea - generation teams high in collectivism have lower perceived diversity than members of idea - generation teams low in collectivism . Collectivism , Perceived Diversity and Brainstorming Perceived diversity has been identified as a double - edge sword in regard to creativity . For example , diversity has been negatively related to creativity via its negative impact on social relations , which is detrimental to creativity because good relationships are necessary for team members to listen and share ideas with one another [ 86 ] . In addition , Session : Teamwork CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 2346 diversity has been shown to be positively related to social loafing [ 91 ] . We propose that the negative impacts of perceived diversity are mitigated in teams high in collectivism . Individuals holding collectivistic beliefs put more weight on group goals than personal interests [ 30 ] and behave more cooperatively [ 120 ] . People holding collectivistic beliefs are more likely to manage their feelings of differences in views and perspectives with more acceptance and openness to such differences [ 82 , 114 ] . In addition , individuals with collectivistic beliefs are more likely to follow social norms of contribution to the team and are less inclined to engage in social loafing [ 29 , 129 ] . However , when brainstorming teams are not high in collectivism we should expect perceived diversity to be weighed down by the negative impacts normally associated with it . Such problems include increases in social loafing from a lack of motivation and decreases in willingness to share with others believed to be different [ 40 , 80 , 91 ] . For example , Graves and Elsass [ 40 ] found that perceived diversity was associated with decreases in information sharing . Taken together , without the benefit of cooperation via collectivism we should expect perceived diversity to have a much less positive impact of creativity in brainstorming teams low in collectivism . This interaction effect leads to our second hypothesis . H2 : Perceived diversity has a more positive relationship with creativity when members of idea - generation teams are higher in collectivism . Collectivism , Perceived Diversity and Satisfaction Satisfaction can be defined as a pleasant or enjoyable feeling associated with an experience [ 98 ] . Satisfaction has been an important topic in brainstorming and virtual collaboration ( e . g . , [ 25 , 34 , 98 , 99 , 117 ] ) because of its positive relationship to future participation , group performance and group cohesiveness [ 28 , 55 , 57 , 58 ] . Typically , perceived diversity is linked to a decrease in satisfaction . Individuals are less likely to hold positive views or have positive interactions with individuals they believe are different [ 13 ] . For example , a study on work teams found that satisfaction was negatively related to perceived deep - level diversity ( i . e . differences in personality and values ) [ 20 ] . This has also been explained by reductions in helping behavior [ 118 ] and increases in task and relationship conflict [ 50 , 81 , 125 ] , all associated with perceptions of diversity . We propose that a team’s collectivism weakens the negative impact of perceived diversity on individual satisfaction . Because collectivism emphasizes relationships , people in teams high in collectivism tend to be reluctant to disagree with others [ 11 ] , are more likely to engage in cooperative behavior [ 120 ] by managing their feelings of differences through compromise [ 82 , 114 ] , and are less likely to engage Figure 1 . Theoretical model . in social loafing [ 29 , 129 ] . Thus , increases in perceived diversity are less likely to translate into decreases in satisfaction when brainstorming teams are high in collectivism . H3 : The negative relationship between perceived diversity and satisfaction is weaker when members of idea - generation teams are high in collectivism . Figure 1 summarizes our three hypotheses in a theoretical research model . RESEARCH METHODOLOGY We know very little , if anything , about the interplay between collectivism and perceived diversity on creativity . To address this lacuna , we conducted a lab experiment to examine the effect of collectivism and perceived diversity on creativity and satisfaction in brainstorming teams . Participants Participants were enrolled at a public university in the United States . A total of 107 subjects were randomly assigned to 33 teams in this study . Sixty - six of the participants were women and 47 were non - white . The participants came from 19 countries . Their ages ranged from 18 years to 45 years , with an average of 21 years . Individuals received $ 12 for participating in the study . In addition , the team with the best performance was awarded an $ 80 bonus . Treatments We used priming as a method to induce collectivism . Priming is a cognitive phenomenon where individuals are exposed to a stimulus that activates their implicit memory and leads to unintentional subsequent behaviors [ 8 ] . Priming has been used successfully as an experimental technique in social psychology ( e . g . , [ 46 ] ) and very recently in brainstorming teams research [ 8 , 23 ] . The collective self and the private self , also called the interdependent self and the independent self , are two different self - construals . Self - construal is conceptualized as individuals’ belief and behavior regarding their relationship with others and the self that is distinct from others [ 103 ] . Different self - construals can lead to variations in personal thoughts and information processing [ 93 , 112 ] . For example , Collectivism Perceived diversity Creativity Satisfaction H1 H2 H3 Session : Teamwork CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 2347 research has found that self - construal priming can affect an individual’s decision - making [ 126 ] , self - esteem [ 44 ] and visual search speed [ 93 ] . In this study we employed two types of priming : collective self - priming and private self - priming . The collective self - priming is used to manipulate collectivism while the private self - priming is used to activate individualism [ 60 ] . The collective self emphasizes relationships and connections with others , such as group memberships and family , while the private self focuses on cognition about one’s personal traits , state and behavior [ 72 , 112 ] . For example , the private self makes the perception of one’s uniqueness more accessible while the collective self makes social norms more accessible [ 126 ] . Trafimow and colleagues showed that self - construal could be primed by asking individuals to think about a question [ 112 , 126 ] , by reading a story [ 93 , 112 ] or by using a specific language [ 62 , 111 ] . We adopted a priming method that has been used in previous studies ( e . g . , [ 112 , 126 ] ) . Participants in the collective self - priming condition were given the following instructions : “Please think of what you have in common with your friends and classmates at [ National University ] . You will have 6 minutes to write down 12 items . ” In the private self - priming condition , participants were instructed : “Please think of what makes you different from your friends and classmates at [ National University ] . You will have 6 minutes to write down 12 items . ” We asked participants to write down their thoughts to make it possible to track whether they were thinking about the self - construal during the given time . Procedure The experiment was conducted in a behavioral lab . Participants were randomly assigned to teams . Teams were randomly assigned to self - construal priming conditions . Participants were first welcomed and then guided to individual cubes in a large behavior lab . Team members were seated separately . To ensure anonymity among team members , participants were provided with an experiment ID and were told not to disclose their personal identification information during the experiment . During the experiment , participants first had a short training session on how to use the chat room on Skype . Participants were instructed that no verbal communication was allowed during the experiment and that the text chat via Skype was the only way to communicate with their teammates . Upon finishing the training , they were primed with the collective or the private self . Next , participants were given 10 minutes to brainstorm with their team via the chat room on Skype . They were asked to generate as many creative ideas as possible to reduce pollution , a task that has been used in a previous group brainstorming study [ 23 ] . Once they finished the brainstorming task , participants completed a survey indicating their collective self - construal ( manipulation check ) , perceived diversity , satisfaction and demographic information . Here , we would like to note the reasons that we asked the participants to use text - only chatting during the entire experiment . In this study , we are interested in understanding how to promote creativity in text - based collaboration teams rather than how text - based collaboration can alter the effects of creativity . This is because text - based communication is one of the most commonly used forms of communication in organizations [ 110 ] . In many cases , teams do not have an option of meeting face - to - face ( FTF ) and instead communicate through text - based forms of communication like Skype . Even when teams do have the FTF option , many default to text - based communication because it enables individuals to communicate in real time , maintain strong relationships and address important problems [ 33 ] . Dependent Variables In this paper , we examine individual creativity instead of team creativity for three main reasons . First , we would like to understand how differences between and within teams matter . Therefore , our research questions call for examining individual outcomes . This is particularly important in this study because it deals with creativity , which is often viewed as an individual trait [ 109 ] . We would also expect perceptions of diversity to differ within as well as across teams . Second , the research we draw from and hope to contribute to primarily examines individual creativity ( e . g . , [ 122 , 123 ] ) . Third , group - level creativity in team ideation is essentially a function of the individual inputs from each member . Therefore , understanding what drives individual creativity is an important predecessor to understanding team creativity . As a result , dependent variables were measured at the individual level . Perceived diversity Items measuring perceived diversity were taken from previous research [ 45 ] . Participants were asked to indicate on a 5 - point Likert scale to what extent they thought they and their team members were similar 1 ) in personal values , 2 ) in priorities , 3 ) in commitment to working hard on this task , 4 ) in how they think their work should be done , 5 ) in their skills and 6 ) in their general abilities to do a task like this . We reverse - coded the score to get the measure of perceived diversity . The Cronbach alpha for the six items was 0 . 80 . Creativity We measured individual creativity in two ways : quantity and quality . Quantity was measured by the number of unique ideas generated by each participant . This measure has been commonly used in brainstorming research to study creativity ( e . g . , [ 25 , 74 , 77 , 106 ] ) . Because this study focuses on individual - level creativity , we used the number of unique ideas . Two graduate students were hired and trained to be raters . Both raters independently analyzed the Session : Teamwork CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 2348 transcripts of the first six groups . They were instructed to identify all of the unique ideas in each transcript . According to Dennis et al . [ 23 ] , inter - rater reliability can be calculated as 1 – the number of differences / total ideas coded . The raters agreed on 134 of the 145 unique ideas , suggesting reliability on number of unique ideas was 92 . 41 percent . Quality was captured by the total quality of unique ideas generated . It measures the overall creativity of all the ideas generated by an individual . According to previous work , total quality is a more reliable measure and produces more consistent results than other measures , such as the average quality of ideas produced by an individual [ 22 , 23 , 27 ] . This is because the average quality of ideas does not take into account the quality relative to the number of ideas an individual produces [ 22 ] . For example , if team member A generates two highly rated ideas ( rated as 5 ) he / she would have an average score of 5 . However , if team member B generated 5 very good ideas ( rated as 5 ) and 1 idea rated as 4 , he / she would have an average of 4 . 83 . This would leave the impression that team member A was more creative regarding quality than team member B . Clearly , this would not be an accurate reflection of idea quality during the ideation session . This is why brainstorming scholars came up with an alternative measure [ 22 , 23 , 27 ] . To produce the total quality of the unique ideas generated by an individual participant , we first took an average of the ratings of the three dimensions for each idea and then summed the averages for each idea generated by an individual participant . Under this approach team member A would receive a score of 10 ( i . e . 5 X 2 ) while team member B would receive a score of 28 . 98 ( i . e . 4 . 83 X 6 ) . We believe these scores better represent the differences in quality between the two teammates . Adopted from Dean et al . [ 21 ] , we used three dimensions to measure the creativity of ideas : originality , applicability and effectiveness . According to Dean et al . [ 21 ] , originality refers to the degree to which the idea is rare , ingenious , imaginative or surprising . Dean et al . defines applicability as the degree to which the idea clearly applies to the stated problem . Finally , effectiveness , according to Dean et al . [ 21 ] , refers to the degree to which the idea is expected to solve the problem stated . Two raters independently rated the first 100 ideas on these three dimensions on a 5 - point Likert scale . The inter - rater reliability was 95 percent , 91 percent , and 95 percent for originality , applicability , and effectiveness , respectively . Among a total of 300 ratings , the raters agreed on 281 . The overall inter - rater reliability was 93 . 67 percent . Satisfaction We measured satisfaction using a 4 - item scale taken from Dennis et al . [ 22 ] . Participants were asked to rate on a 5 - point Likert scale to what extent they were satisfied with their experience . The items were : “How do you feel about the process by which you generated ideas ? ” , “How do you feel about the ideas proposed ? ” , “How do you feel about other members of the group ? ” and “Overall , how satisfied did you find your experience ? ” The Cronbach alpha for the four items was 0 . 86 . Control Variables Following other researchers and indications of previous literature ( e . g . , [ 62 , 74 , 94 , 99 , 102 ] ) , we additionally controlled for variables at both the individual and the team levels . We controlled for demographic factors , including gender [ 99 ] , age , native language and national culture . The national culture was a dummy variable coded with 0 meaning non - Western culture and 1 meaning Western culture . About 99 percent of the sample fell into Western and Asian cultures . Gender was measured by creating another dummy variable where male was represented by 0 and female by 1 . Native language was also measured by using a dummy variables where English ( 77 out of 107 participants ) was coded as 1 and other languages coded as 0 . We also controlled for group size [ 94 , 102 ] and group membership ( i . e . group ID ) for hypotheses testing . Manipulation Check We conducted a manipulation check to ensure that our priming took effect . Individuals high in collectivism should have higher levels of the collective self than their counterparts . To be consistent , we employed the same items used in previous studies that manipulated the collective self . These items were taken from the collective self - construal scale for the post - task manipulation check . The scale by Leung and Kim ( 1997 ) [ 68 ] is one of the three most commonly used self - construal scales [ 42 ] . It has been recently used to measure the collective self and the private self ( e . g . , [ 6 , 63 , 85 ] ) . To determine which items to select , we conducted a pilot study with items from Leung and Kim’s collective self - construal scale [ 68 ] . Based on the results of this pilot study we selected the most reliable items that best represented our context . The items were : “When with my group , I watched my words so I didn ' t offend anyone , ” “I considered how I could be helpful to specific others in my group , ” “I was careful to maintain harmony in my group” and “The security of being an accepted member of a group was very important to me . ” Participants were asked to indicate to what degree they agreed with the items . RESULTS Manipulation Check A mixed - model analysis showed that participants primed with the collective self had a significantly higher score for the collective self than participants primed with the private self ( t = 2 . 74 , p < 0 . 05 ) . The Cronbach alpha for the four items was 0 . 70 . Hypotheses Testing We wanted to account for the individual differences among team members , so we conducted the analysis at the individual level . Because the individuals were nested in teams and not independent , hypotheses were tested using a Session : Teamwork CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 2349 linear mixed model , controlling for demographic factors and group - level factors . SPSS 22 . 0 ( IBM , Armonk , NY ) was used to test the proposed research model . Table 1 lists means , standard deviations and correlations . We further standardized demographic variables for hypotheses testing . Table 2 shows the results of the analysis . Please note that all of these results hold even if we remove national language or national culture from the model . Hypothesis 1 posited that collectivism would be associated with decreases in perceived diversity . The mixed - model test showed a negative relationship between collectivism and perceived diversity ( β = - 0 . 49 , t = 2 . 20 , p < . 05 ) , supporting hypothesis 1 . Hypothesis 2 posited an interaction effect between collectivism and perceived diversity on creativity . The results of the mixed - model test on number of unique ideas ( β = 2 . 78 , t = 2 . 87 , p < 0 . 01 ) and on quality of unique ideas ( β = 6 . 68 , t = 2 . 47 , p < 0 . 05 ) both supported this hypothesis . Figure 2 and Figure 3 display the two - way interaction associated with hypothesis 2 . Figure 2 clearly highlights the positive relationship between perceived diversity and the number of unique ideas when participants were primed with high collectivism . Figure 3 clearly highlights the positive relationship between perceived diversity and the quality of ideas when participants were primed with collectivism . Hypothesis 3 posited that collectivism moderates the relationship between perceived diversity and satisfaction . However , the results failed to support the hypothesis ( β = 0 . 14 , t = 1 . 23 , p = 0 . 22 ) . Surprisingly , however , we found that collectivism has an indirect effect on satisfaction via perceived diversity . In other words , collectivism was associated with increases in satisfaction by being negatively related to perceived diversity . We tested for the indirect effect by the Sobel test . The Sobel test was significant ( z = 2 . 11 , p < 0 . 05 ) , indicating that the indirect effect was significant . Figure 4 summarizes our findings .

Session : Teamwork CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 2350 DISCUSSION The objective of this study was to theoretically explain and empirically examine how collectivism could lead to more creativity in virtual ideation teams high in perceived diversity . Our results highlight the importance of priming individuals in ideation teams with high levels of collectivism . In the following section we discuss the implications for theory as well as for the design of collaborative systems . First , we found a negative relationship between collectivism and perceived diversity . In other words , when participants were high in collectivism they were less inclined to feel like they were different from their teammates . Perceived diversity has been found to decrease trust , cooperation , coordination and social integration in both collocated and virtual teams [ 46 , 91 , 93 ] . When we consider the negative implications , we find hope in discovering that collectivism reduces perceived diversity and the problems associated with it . This , in turn , should promote teamwork in many different types of tasks . Second , we identified collectivism as a moderator of the relationship between perceived diversity and creativity . Our experiment showed that perceived diversity was associated with more and higher - quality unique ideas when participants were high in collectivism . In other words , participants who thought their teammates were different from themselves were significantly more creative when they were high in collectivism . Collectivism facilitates creativity because with it , people are more cooperative and as a result they are more motivated to contribute to the team and are less likely to free - ride on their teammates’ work . As a result , collectivism amplified the effect of perceived diversity on creativity . Third , our findings contradict previous literature that has found that collectivism decreases individual creativity in teams [ 39 , 123 , 124 ] . Taken together , findings 1 and 2 help provide an explanation for why collectivism could be associated with increases and decreases in creativity . Our study indicates that the negative relationship between collectivism and creativity may be a result of collectivism’s relationship with perceived diversity . Increases in collectivism are likely to correspond with decreases in perceived diversity . To the degree that teams are low in perceived diversity they may be less creative . These individuals are more likely to conform and less likely to think divergently and come up with more creative ideas [ 11 , 39 , 79 ] . Researchers have shown that teams often need to recognize their differences to take advantage of them [ 45 , 67 ] . In particular , when team members do not believe they have unique contributions to make to the team , they are less likely to contribute to that team [ 91 ] . On the other hand , collectivism in our study was associated with increases in idea generation by bolstering the impact of perceived diversity on idea generation . From a theoretical perspective , the duality associated with collectivism is both puzzling and interesting . Many team tasks need both cooperation and creativity ; therefore , our findings are important to understanding when collectivism can promote creativity . Figure 2 .

Although there was no interaction between collectivism and perceived diversity on satisfaction , there was a significant indirect effect of perceived diversity on the relationship between collectivism and satisfaction . In other words , collectivism was negatively related to perceived diversity and perceived diversity was negatively associated with satisfaction . This finding sheds light on why collectivism has often been associated with increases in satisfaction ( e . g . , [ 75 , 83 ] ) . These results highlight the important role of perceived diversity in idea - generation teams over and above idea generation . Finally , our study extends the CSCW / HCI literature on diversity . We found that perceived diversity was central to understanding individuals’ perceptions of enjoyment ( i . e . satisfaction ) and also their level of creativity during brainstorming sessions . While the perception of diversity has attracted attention in work teams ( e . g . , [ 51 , 94 , 118 ] ) , little research has been conducted to examine its effect in areas like ideation and brainstorming teams [ 94 ] . Our findings highlight the need for CSCW / HCI scholars to focus more attention on the effects of perceptions to help understanding of how to promote better outcomes in the field of ideation and brainstorming . Perceptions may be particularly important to CSCW / HCI scholars who study brainstorming in virtual or technology - enabled teams , because people in these teams commonly lack physical contact as well as a shared context [ 47 , 48 , 95 ] and they are more likely to make inferences about their dispersed teammates based on perceptions . Implications for Design Results from this study highlight the need to facilitate both collectivism and perceived diversity . In this section we discuss how systems could be designed to promote both collectivism and perceived diversity when needed . We propose designing systems to prime individuals as one way to increase collectivism . We propose three approaches to embedding priming into collaborative systems . First , as found in previous studies ( e . g . , [ 41 , 69 ] ) , priming can be embedded via a pre - task prompt . The system can prompt individuals to write down what they have in common with or what makes them different from their friends or co - workers , depending on the context . The system would only allow users to proceed to the ideation session after they had submitted their list of differences or similarities . Second , a system might be designed to show a message on its starting or loading page that asks participants to think about what they have in common with or how they differ from their teammates . A timer could be preset to the length of time required for the prime . Third , embedding pictures into the background of the interface is another approach [ 61 , 64 ] . For example , a picture where six people hug one another versus a logo where one person spreads his arms and looks toward the horizon could effectively activate collectivism versus individualism ( e . g . , [ 61 ] ) . The fact that CSCW scholars [ 69 ] have successfully incorporated affective primes as background pictures in Adobe Ideas , a system to support creativity , further spotlights the possibility of embedding picture primes of collectivism in ideation systems . System personalization could be used to facilitate idea generation by promoting perceptions of diversity . Results of our study indicate that perceived diversity could be a key driver of idea generation . Previous studies have shown that allowing users to personalize their system interface can increase users’ perception of their own identity ( e . g . , [ 59 , 71 ] ) . Therefore , collaborative systems could be designed to promote perceived diversity by allowing users to customize their interface and style . For example , users could be allowed to choose the interface background , the fonts ( e . g . , style , size , color ) and format ( e . g . , layout , gif versus photo ) everywhere in the system , such as starting page , chatting interface and personal profile . Designers could also add features that can assess the needs of individuals in real time and automatically take corresponding action to promote creativity . For example , these features could include assessing a user’s perceptions of diversity and degree of collectivism after a couple of trial brainstorming sessions and then determining whether one of both should be promoted . Once this is done the system could either prompt individuals to list several things they have in common with others or allow users to personalize their interfaces . In sum , this study has important implications for the design of collaborative systems . Ultimately , the decision whether to promote collectivism or not depends on the need of a particular team . Regardless , we think collaborative systems can be designed to support this decision . Limitations There are a few limitations of this research — all of which highlight opportunities for future research . First , participants were randomly assigned and did not know their teammates’ identity . Although these conditions are needed for internal validity , they may also limit the paper’s external validity . Field research in organizations and online communities with actual working groups could be used to verify the findings in other settings . Second , a single brainstorming task was used in this study . Further studies could be done on projects that require more interactions over a longer period of time . Third , the perceived diversity used in this study was deep - level perceived diversity [ 45 ] . We didn’t explore the surface - level perceived diversity ( e . g . , age , gender , ethnicity ) because participants didn’t know such information in the virtual context we provided . Researchers might want to examine the potential effect of surface - level perceived diversity . Finally , this study examined effects on two brainstorming outcomes , but future work is needed to explore how collectivism and Session : Teamwork CSCW 2017 , February 25 – March 1 , 2017 , Portland , OR , USA 2352 perceived diversity affect other team outcomes , such as decision - making . CONCLUSION A collectivistic team culture has been proposed to have both negative and positive effects on brainstorming outcomes . However , researchers have not examined the mechanisms behind these effects . Our findings suggest that perceived diversity could help to explain these divergent effects . We found , experimentally , that priming team members with a collectivist reference decreased their perceptions of diversity and , in turn , helped to engender creativity and satisfaction outcomes . This is a significant finding that offers new insights for scholars of group dynamics as well as designers of group - support systems .
