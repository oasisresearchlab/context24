Polyacrylamide ( PA ) gels have been widely used to study cell - ECM mechanical interactions . Typically , sulfosuccinimidyl 6 - ( 4 ′ - azido - 2 ′ - nitrophenylamino ) hexanoate ( sulfo - SANPAH ) is used as a protein crosslinker in these gels . However , its low solubility , unstable binding with proteins , and high cost are barriers to its application . The objective of this study was to improve and simplify the preparation of PA gels using an economical crosslinker , N - hydroxysuccinimide - acrylamide ( NHS - AA ) ester , to enable increased stability in protein coating . By exposing excess NHS to the gel surface , we found an optimal ratio of NHS - AA ester : AA to obtain NHS - AA ester - containing PA gels with a uniform ECM protein coating and stiffness similar to that of sulfo - SANPAH - containing PA gels . The biological behavior of MCF7 and MCF10A cells were similar on NHS - AA ester and sulfo - SANPAH gels . Acini formation in Matrigel overlay culture were also consistent on NHS - AA ester and sulfo - SANPAH gels . This novel PA gel preparation method using NHS - AA ester can effectively replace the sulfo - SANPAH method and will be immensely useful in the evaluation of cell - ECM mechanical interactions .

In regenerative medicine , optimal stiffness of the culture substrate increases the ef ﬁ ciency of induction of differentiation and establishment of three - dimensional ( 3D ) culture systems for organ regeneration ( Engler et al . , 2006 ; Kolahi et al . , 2012 ) . In cancer biology , a relationship has been demonstrated between mammary tissue stiffness and breast cancer progression ( Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Levental et al . , 2007 , 2009 ; Butcher et al . , 2009 ) . Various cell culture materials are used to investigate the effects of ECM stiffness on cellular responses , including biomaterials such as collagen ( Parenteau - Bareil et al . , 2010 ) , Matrigel ( Kleinman et al . , 1986 ) , polysaccharide ( Baldwin and Kiick , 2010 ) , polyacrylamide ( PA ) ( Kandow et al . , 2007 ) , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) ( Zhu , 2010 ) , and self - assembling peptides ( Koutsopoulos , 2016 ) . Among them , PA gels are most widely used to study cell - ECM mechanical interactions , because of their convenient usage , biocompatibility , and reproducibility of stiffness ( Kandow et al . , 2007 ; Tilghman et al . , 2010 ; Dupont et al . , 2011 ; Wen et al . , 2014 ; Tsou et al . , 2016 ; Domura et al . , 2017 ; Martín et al . , 2017 ) . PA gels require protein crosslinkers to crosslink ECM proteins to the gel for cell adhesion . Sulfosuccinimidyl 6 - ( 4 ′ - azido - 2 ′ - nitrophenylamino ) hexanoate ( sulfo - SANPAH ) is a commonly used PA gel crosslinker ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ) . ECM proteins displace the sulfosuccinimidyl groups of sulfo - SANPAH molecules , forming amide bonds ( Figure 1A ) . However , ECM protein binding by sulfo - SANPAH is unstable and can result in inconsistent effects of gel stiffness on cellular responses ( Kandow et al . , 2007 ; Yip et al . , 2013 ) . This is presumably due to the nonspeci ﬁ c binding of sulfo - SANPAH to the PA gel through ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiation ( Figure 1B , top ) . In addition , the low solubility and high cost of sulfo - SANPAH can hinder experiments that require large amounts of PA gel ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Kandow et al . , 2007 ) . To improve the stability of protein bound to PA gels , several alternative methods have been developed , which attach ECM proteins to the gels by covalent bonds using 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( Beningo and Wang , 2002 ; Kandow et al . , 2007 ) , N - acryloyl - 6 - aminocaproic acid ( ACA ) ( Yip et al . , 2013 ) , or the N - succinimidyl ester of acrylamidohexanoic acid ( N6 ; Table 1 ) ( Willcox et al . , 2005 ; Kandow et al . , 2007 ) . However , these crosslinkers have not been widely accepted as sulfo - SANPAH alternatives because they require long reaction times or are commercially unavailable . NHS has a long history of use as an easy - to - dissolve and economical protein crosslinker and is used in the ACA and N6 protocols to initiate substitution reactions with ECM proteins . FIGURE 1 | Overview of protein crosslinker action and PA gel preparation ( A ) When sulfo - SANPAH is used as a protein crosslinker , the ECM protein forms an amide bond with the reactive site of sulfo - SANPAH and indirectly binds to PA . When NHS - AA ester is used as a protein crosslinker , the ECM protein forms an amide bonddirectlywithPA . ( B ) OutlineofthePAgelpreparationmethod . Whensulfo - SANPAHisusedasaproteincrosslinker , 0 . 5 mLofsulfo - SANPAHsolution ( 0 . 2 mg / mL ) was applied to the gel surface under 365 nm UV light after polymerization of AA and bis - AA ( top ) . When NHS - AA ester is used as a protein crosslinker , it is mixed with AA and bis - AA before polymerization ( bottom ) . Frontiers in Materials | www . frontiersin . org February 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 637278 2 Kumai et al . PA gel with NHS - AA Ester However , direct conjugation of NHS to acrylamide ( AA ) would simplify the protocol , as ECM proteins could be covalently bound directly to AA through a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction ( Figure 1A , bottom ) . Only one study has reported a protocol for the preparation method of PA gels using NHS , in which NHS was mixed with an AA / bis - AA mixture before polymerization ( Cretu et al . , 2010 ) . However , this protocol is practically dif ﬁ cult , because NHS binding to AA requires esteri ﬁ cation of the amide group , which only occurs under nonphysiological conditions involving strong acids or bases in high temperatures ( Greenberg et al . , 2000 ) . NHS - AA ester is a commercially available alternative that avoids this problem . NHS - AA ester , dissolved in toluene , is applied to an AA / bis - AA mixture prior to polymerization ( Schnaar and Lee , 1975 ; Schnaar et al . , 1978 ; Kandow et al . , 2007 ) ; however , it is dif ﬁ cult to uniformly distribute NHS on the gel surface by pouring liquid on liquid , and thus impractical . A practical method would require mixing NHS - AA ester with AA and bis - AA before polymerization ( Figure 1B , bottom ) . In this study , we developed a new preparation method for PA gels using NHS - AA ester , and demonstrated its utility in studying the effects of ECM stiffness on cellular behavior . We optimized the ratios of NHS - AA ester and AA to achieve similar stiffness to sulfo - SANPAH gels and accomplished uniform ECM protein coating ef ﬁ cacy on gels on various stiffness . In addition , we compared cellular behaviors on gels containing NHS - AA ester and sulfo - SANPAH . The results suggest that NHS - AA ester - containing PA gels can be used as an inexpensive and reproducible alternative to sulfo - SANPAH - containing gels .

After incubation , the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 g and the toluene was removed . The soft gel solutions were degassed for 30 min in vacuum . To activate polymerization , 10 μ L of 10 % ammonium persulfate ( APS ) and 1 μ L of tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED ) ( 1 % and 0 . 1 % of total volume , respectively ) ( both from Fuji ﬁ lm Wako Pure Chemical ) were added and brie ﬂ y mixed .

The sandwiched gels were incubated for 30 min ( PA1 ) , 20 min ( PA2 and PA3 ) , and 10 min ( PA4 ) at RT , and then the top coverslips were removed . The polymerized gels were transferred to 6 - well plates and washed three times for 5 min with 2 mL of phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) to remove unreacted AA .

PA gel with NHS - AA Ester Measurement of PA Gel Stiffness by Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) The Young ’ s modulus of elasticity , which represents the stiffness of PA gels , was measured with AFM for each type of gel . The prepared PA gels were washed twice with 2 mL PBS and placed in a 35 - mm dish . To measure their actual stiffness , the gels were immersed in PBS and force was measured on a NanoWizard three NanoOptics atomic force microscope ( JPK Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) . Young ’ s modulus was calculated for each force curve using JPK DP Data Processing Software ( JPK Instruments ) , which uses a Hertzian contact model . Cloning , Expression , and Puri ﬁ cation of EGFP A cDNA encoding EGFP was ampli ﬁ ed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ( KOD FX Neo ; TOYOBO Co . , Ltd , Osaka , Japan ) using primers containing the BamHI ( forward , 5 ′ - cgggatccATGG TGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTG - 3 ′ ) and the EcoRI ( reverse , 5 ′ - cggaattcTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGAGAGTG - 3 ′ ) restriction sites of pGEX - 6P - 1 ( GE Healthcare , Chicago , IL , United States ) . The vector and PCR products were digested with BamHI / EcoRI and ligated together using T4 DNA ligase ( TAKARA BIO Inc . , Shiga , Japan ) . After plasmid puri ﬁ cation and sequencing , the pGEX - 6P - EGFP expression vector was transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) competent Escherichia coli ( TAKARA BIO Inc . ) . Colonies were inoculated in 2 L of Luria - Bertani broth for large - scale culture , and GST - EGFP expression was induced with 0 . 5 mM isopropyl β - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h . The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 mL of lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 1 % TritonX - 100 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 5 ) and disrupted by sonication . Then , the lysate was added to a 50 % glutathione Sepharose ( Nakarai Tesque Inc . ) slurry in 4 mL PBS and incubated at 4 ° C for 1 h , and then washed with PBS . To elute EGFP , the beads were mixed with 2 mL of elution buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 5 ) containing 360 U of PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare ) and incubated at 4 ° C for 5 h . The supernatant was collected and EGFP concentration was measured using a BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Quantitation of EGFP and Rhodamine - Fibronectin Coating of PA Gels EGFP and rhodamine - ﬁ bronectin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . , Denver , CO , United States ) were conjugated to gels overnight . The gels were then mounted with VECTASHIELD ® Antifade Mounting Medium ( Novus Biologicals , Littleton , CO , United States ) and examined on an Eclipse Ti microscope ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , Melville , NY , United States ) ﬁ tted with a Plan Fluor 10 × objective lens ( numerical aperture ( NA ) 0 . 3 ; Nikon Instruments Inc . ) . The ﬂ uorescent intensities of EGFP and rhodamine - ﬁ bronectin were quanti ﬁ ed using ImageJ v . 2 . 0 . 0 - rc - 69 / 1 . 52p ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , United States ) . Fluorescent intensities were calculated as the difference between the average ﬂ uorescent intensity of the proteins in each ﬁ eld and the background ﬂ uorescent intensity . Fluorescence from ﬁ ve randomly selected ﬁ elds was measured . Cell Proliferation and Adhesion Assays The gels were coated with 100 µg / mL collagen I ( Corning Inc , Corning , NY , United States ) . For proliferation assays , 1 . 0 × 10 5 cells were added to each well and incubated at 37 ° C for 3 days . For cell adhesion assays , 5 . 0 × 10 5 cells were added to each well and incubated at 37 ° C for 1 h . In both assays , the cells were counted using cell counting kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 , Dojindo Molecular Technologies , Inc . , Kumamoto , Japan ) . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Sunrise microplate reader ( Tecan Japan Co . Ltd . , Kawasaki , Japan ) . Cell Area and Circularity Cells were examined on an Eclipse Ti microscope ﬁ tted with a Plan Fluor 20 × objective lens ( NA 0 . 45 ; Nikon Instruments Inc . ) . After binary image processing , the cell area and circularity were measured using ImageJ . Five randomly selected ﬁ elds were considered . Immuno ﬂ uorescence MCF10A cells ( 5 × 10 4 ) were cultured on collagen - coated PA gels for 24 h . The cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 1 % ( for p - FAK ) and 0 . 1 % ( for YAP ) Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min , and then blocked with 3 % BSA in PBS for 30 min at RT . The cells were incubated with 1 : 50 solution of primary antibodies , for p - FAK and YAP , overnight at 4 ° C , and then incubated with secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33 , 342 ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) at RT for 30 min . Finally , the cells were mounted with VECTASHIELD ® and examined on an Eclipse Ti microscope ﬁ tted with a Plan Fluor 20 × objective lens ( NA 0 . 45 ; Nikon Instruments Inc . ) . Matrigel Overlay Culture on PA Gel Matrigel overlay culture on PA gel was performed as previously described , with slight modi ﬁ cations ( Debnath et al . , 2003 ) . MCF10A cells were detached with trypsin at 37 ° C for 5 min to ensure complete collection of the cells , and then resuspended in culture medium ( DMEM / F12 supplemented with 20 ng / mL of EGF , 100 ng / mL of cholera toxin , 0 . 01 mg / mL of insulin , 500 ng / mL of hydrocortisone , 5 % horse serum , 100 U / mL penicillin , and 100 μ g / mL streptomycin ) . The cells were washed with assay medium ( DMEM / F12 supplemented with 100 ng / mL of cholera toxin , 0 . 01 mg / mL of insulin , 500 ng / mL of hydrocortisone , 2 % horse serum , 100 U / mL penicillin and 100 μ g / mL streptomycin ) , and then counted and diluted to 1 × 10 4 cells / mL in assay medium at RT . We prepared 4 % Matrigel solution in assay medium at 4 ° C . Then , the cells and Matrigel solution were combined in 1 : 1 ratio . PA gels were transferred to 12 - well plates , washed with assay medium three times , and 1 mL of the cell - Matrigel mixture ( 5 × 10 3 cells / well ) was applied to the PA gel . The cells were refed assay medium containing 2 % Matrigel every 4 days . After 10 days , the cells were examined on an Eclipse Ti microscope ﬁ tted with a Plan Fluor 20 × objective lens ( NA 0 . 45 ; Nikon Instruments Inc . ) .

PA gel with NHS - AA Ester Statistical Analysis Differences between pairs of groups were analyzed by two - tailed unpaired Student ’ s t - test . p values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . Error bars in all ﬁ gures represent the mean of three independent experiments ± the standard deviation ( SD ) . Data for in vitro experiments represent the results of three independent biological replicates . RESULTS Determination of the Optimal NHS - AA ester : AA Mixing Ratio In the development of a new PA gel preparation method , we aimed to create gels that simulate the stiffness of various tissues . We used previously described AA : bis - AA mixing ratios of PA gels using sulfo - SANPAH that resulted in four different stiffness levels ( 0 . 48 , 1 , 3 . 24 , and 34 . 88 kPa ) ( Tse and Engler , 2010 ) . We hypothesized that if we use the published amount of bis - AA and ensure that the total amount of acryloyl groups in the gel came from NHS - AA ester and AA together , the stiffness of the NHS - AA ester gels would stay the same as the reference gels , as NHS would be hydrolyzed and dissolved in water . According to this hypothesis , we determined the optimal NHS - AA ester : AA ratio at the four stiffness levels mentioned above . With the optimal mixing ratio , the ECM proteins should uniformly coat gels of any stiffness when equal amounts of ECM proteins are applied . Excess surface crosslinker permits the saturated binding of a constant amount of ECM protein , and the amount of protein coating the surface is proportional to the amount of applied ECM protein ( Beer et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , we aimed to identify a mixing ratio that provided an excess of surface NHS and used it to con ﬁ rm uniform ECM protein coating of different stiffness gels . First , we optimized the highest NHS - AA ester : AA ratio that solidi ﬁ ed the gel , since NHS - AA ester was presumed to inhibit the polymerization of AA and bis - AA . At a 1 : 5 ratio , the gel did not adequately solidify ( data not shown ) , whereas polymerization was successful at ratios of 1 : 6 and lower . We examined the adhesion and proliferation of MCF7 cells on collagen I - coated gels of the softest stiffness ( Table 2 ) at various mixing ratios . Adherent cells were evenly distributed on the gel at a mixing ratio of 1 : 6 . The distribution of adherent cells became uneven ( Figure 2A ) and the proliferation signi ﬁ cantly decreased ( Figure 2B ) as the proportion of NHS - AA ester decreased . Next , we examined the uniformity of cell adhesion on gels of different stiffness ( PA1 - 4 , with PA1 being the softest and PA4 being the stiffest ; Table 2 ) at the mixing ratio of 1 : 6 . Adhesion was uniform on gels of all stiffness levels ( Figure 2C ) , while proliferation was signi ﬁ cantly reduced on soft gels compared to stiff gels ( Figure 2D ) . These results suggest that a mixing ratio of 1 : 6 enables adequate gel solidi ﬁ cation and uniform ECM protein coating of gels of various stiffness . Elastic Moduli of PA Gels Made With NHS - AA Ester We measured the elastic moduli of 1 : 6 gels of four different stiffness levels ( Table 2 ) by AFM and compared them with FIGURE 2 | Effects of NHS - AA ester : AA mixing ratios on cell proliferation and adhesion .

The elastic modulus values of each gel ( 3 . 84 , 7 . 98 , 20 . 76 , and 142 . 8 kPa ) were approximately three times higher than the estimated values ( 0 . 48 , 1 , 3 . 24 and 34 . 88 kPa ) , but the rates of changes in stiffness between the gels were equivalent to the estimated values ( Figure 3 ) . Con ﬁ rmation of Protein Coating Ef ﬁ cacy on PA Gels Containing NHS - AA Ester We examined whether surface NHS was in suf ﬁ cient excess for uniform ECM protein coating of gels at each stiffness level . The ﬂ uorescent intensity of enhanced green ﬂ uorescent protein ( EGFP ) reached saturation on both , the softest and the stiffest gels ( PA1 and PA4 , respectively ) at mixing ratios above 1 : 8 , indicating that excess NHS was present on the gel surface at these ratios ( Figure 4A ) . There were no differences in EGFP coating ef ﬁ cacy among the gels of different stiffness , and the amount of EGFP coating the gels was proportional to the amount applied ( Figure 4B ) . Equivalent ECM protein coating ef ﬁ cacy among gels of different stiffness was also con ﬁ rmed using rhodamine - ﬁ bronectin ( Figure 4C ) . Since the 1 : 6 mixing ratio was the maximum ratio that displayed equal protein coating ef ﬁ cacy at different stiffness levels , it was used in subsequent experiments . Comparison of Cell Behavior on PA Gels Containing NHS - AA Ester and Sulfo - SANPAH To con ﬁ rm that the NHS - AA ester - containing PA gels could reproduce the results of previous biological experiments conducted with PA gels containing sulfo - SANPAH , we ﬁ rst compared cell adhesion , proliferation , and morphology on gels made with NHS - AA ester and sulfo - SANPAH . There were no signi ﬁ cant differences in the adhesion of MCF7 and MCF10A cells on NHS - AA ester and sulfo - SANPAH gels of any stiffness ( Figure 5A ) . However , both cell lines displayed increased proliferation on NHS - AA ester gels than on sulfo - SANPAH gels ( Figure 5B ) . With both crosslinkers , proliferation increased with increase in gel stiffness , while adhesion was unaffected by stiffness ( Figures 5A , B ) . The morphology of MCF7 cells changed from circular to spreading with increasing stiffness , and similar changes observed on gels with either of the crosslinkers ( Figure 5C ) . The cell area ( Figure 5D ) and circularity ( Figure 5E ) were similar in both cell lines on both gel types . These results indicate that gels containing NHS - AA ester induce cellular responses comparable to those containing sulfo - SANPAH . Immunostaining and Matrigel Overlay Culture on PA Gels Containing NHS - AA Ester To evaluate cellular responses to stiffness changes , we immunostained cells adhered to NHS - AA ester - containing PA gels for phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase ( p - FAK ) and Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator ( YAP ) . In MCF10A cells , focal adhesions stained with p - FAK increased in both size and number on stiff gels than on soft gels ( Figure 6A ) . YAP localized to the cytoplasm of MCF10A cells adhered to soft gels but was translocated to the nucleus in cells on stiff gels ( Figure 6B ) . Furthermore , in Matrigel overlay culture , MCF10A cells formed acini on soft gels and displayed a spread morphology on the surface of stiff gels ( Figure 6C ) . These results indicate that PA gels using NHS - AA ester can reproduce the typical biological behaviors of cells on PA gels using sulfo - SANPAH . FIGURE3 | Elasticmoduli ofPAgels .

PA gel with NHS - AA Ester DISCUSSION In this study , we have developed a new preparation method for PA gels using NHS - AA ester . These gels overcome the disadvantages of sulfo - SANPAH and can be produced for less than 1 % the cost of sulfo - SANPAH gels using a simpler preparation procedure than other alternative methods . Due to the excess surface NHS and the covalent nature of the bonds formed , the ECM protein on gels containing NHS - AA ester is uniform and stable , and ef ﬁ ciently transmits the stiffness of gels to cells . Importantly , cellular responses to changes in gel stiffness ef ﬁ ciently replicated those reported for sulfo - SANPAH gels .

PA gel with NHS - AA Ester With the goal of a simple preparation method , we mixed NHS - AA ester with AA and bis - AA before polymerization . When compared with gels containing sulfo - SANPAH or other alternative protein crosslinkers like ACA or N6 , the preparation of PA gels containing NHS - AA ester is simpler . Since it is dif ﬁ cult to have equal number of crosslinking sites on gels of every stiffness , we provided an excess of surface NHS to ensure equivalent ECM protein coating . Therefore , the amounts of NHS contained in gels of each stiffness may be nonuniform , but the excess NHS enables ligand saturation , resulting in uniform ECM protein coating at all stiffness levels . Mixing NHS - AA ester into the gel results in NHS hydrolysis , resulting in negatively charged carboxyl groups that could impair gel durability ( Kandow et al . , 2007 ; Lee et al . , 2009 ) . However , in our experience , the durability of the gels containing NHS - AA ester was not noticeably different from that of gels containing sulfo - SANPAH . We estimated that the gel stiffness levels established for sulfo - SANPAH - containing gels would be maintained in NHS - AA ester - containing gels if equal amounts of acryloyl groups were incorporated . However , the elastic modulus values of NHS - AA ester - containing PA gels of respective stiffness were approximately three times the reference values of gels containing sulfo - SANPAH . Nonetheless , the rates of increases in stiffness among the gels were equivalent to the estimated values ( Table 2 ) and cellular responses on gels with NHS - AA ester were similar to those with sulfo - SANPAH . This suggests that the observed differences between the measured and estimated values may be due to differences in the AFM systems used . Despite their advantages , NHS - AA ester - containing PA gels do have some limitations . ECM proteins must be coated immediately after polymerization , because NHS - AA ester is quickly hydrolyzed , whereas gels for sulfo - SANPAH experiments can be stored for approximately 3 days prior to sulfo - SANPAH conjugation before the stiffness changes ( Denisin and Pruitt , 2016 ) . In this study , we used glass coverslips with a diameter of 22 mm , as we found that the surface tension of the acrylamide mixture hindered the generation of larger or smaller gels by the described sandwich method . However , a modi ﬁ ed preparation method for smaller scale gels used in drug screening studies has been reported ( Medina et al . , 2019 ) . To investigate the effects of ECM stiffness on cellular responses , several 3D culture systems have recently been developed ( Chaudhuri et al . , 2014 ; Neves et al . , 2020 ; Yamada et al . , 2020 ) . Although 3D culture systems are close to the biological environment , they are unable to separate the effects of structure and stiffness on cellular behavior . Thus , the PA gel culture will continue to be a useful experimental system for analyzing the effects of stiffness on cellular behavior . In this study , we have developed a novel preparation method for PA gels using NHS - AA ester as a protein crosslinker . ECM proteins covalently bind to PA on these gels which ef ﬁ ciently transmit the stiffness of gels to cells . These economical gels are simple to make , highly reproducible , and allow experiments with large number of PA gels . The PA gels using NHS - AA ester is a practical and inexpensive alternative to sulfo - SANPAH gels in the evaluation of cell - ECM mechanical interactions . They may also contribute to advancements in various research areas , such as cancer biology , regenerative medicine , and embryology .
