Stefan Institute , Jamova 39 , 1000 Ljubljana , Slovenia ∗ ( Dated : February 2 , 2008 ) Myosin V is a two - headed processive motor protein that walks in a hand - over - hand fashion along actin ﬁlaments . When it encounters a ﬁlament branch , formed by the Arp2 / 3 complex , it can either stay on the straight mother ﬁlament , or switch to the daughter ﬁlament . We study both probabilities using the elastic lever arm model for myosin V . We calculate the shapes and bending energies of all relevant conﬁgurations in which the trail head is bound to the actin ﬁlament before Arp2 / 3 and the lead head is bound either to the mother or to the daughter ﬁlament . Based on the assumption that the probability for a head to bind to a certain actin subunit is proportional to the Boltzmann factor obtained from the elastic energy , we calculate the mother / daughter ﬁlament branching ratio . Our model predicts a value of 27 % for the daughter and 73 % for the mother ﬁlament . This result is in good agreement with recent experimental data . I . INTRODUCTION Myosin V is a two - headed processive motor protein from the myosin superfamily , involved in diﬀerent forms of intracellular transport [ 1 , 2 ] . It has drawn a lot of attention in recent years and is now one of the best stud - ied motor proteins . The experiments have characterized it mechanically [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] , biochemically [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] , optically [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] and structurally [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ] . These studies have shown that myosin V walks along actin ﬁlaments in a hand - over - hand fash - ion [ 15 , 22 ] with an average step size of about 35 nm , roughly corresponding to the periodicity of actin ﬁla - ments [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 16 , 18 ] , a stall force of around 2 pN [ 3 ] and a run length of a few microns [ 3 , 23 , 24 ] . Under physiological conditions , ADP release has been identiﬁed as the time limiting step in the duty cycle [ 3 , 11 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex [ 25 ] initiates actin ﬁlament branching in the vicinity of a protruding edge of a cell . The complex consists of 7 subunits ( Arp2 , Arp3 and ARPC1 through ARPC5 ) and is activated by WASp / Scar proteins [ 26 ] . It binds to the side of one ( “mother” ) actin ﬁlament and initiates the nucleation of a second ( “daughter” ﬁlament ) , which starts grow - ing with the fast growing end ( “ + ” end ) away from the Arp2 / 3 complex . The mother and the daughter ﬁlament enclose an angle of 70 ◦ . The question what happens to a myosin V motor when it arrives at an Arp2 / 3 mediated actin ﬁlament junction is of interest for several reasons . First , the branching behavior is important for understanding vesicle transport in the actin cortex . And second , it is of high interest when studying the fundamental mechanism of myosin V stepping , because it represents a well deﬁned situation in which predictions from diﬀerent theoretical models can be tested against the experimental result . Our aim in this ∗ Electronic address : andrej . vilfan @ ijs . si article is to use the elastic lever arm model for myosin V , which is described in detail in a previous article [ 27 ] , to predict the dynamics of a myosin V motor that passes over an Arp2 / 3 junction . In particular , we will calculate the probabilities that a motor continues along the mother or the daughter ﬁlament . II . MODEL The idea behind the elastic lever arm model for myosin V is to describe the dimeric motor as an assembly of two identical heads , connected together and to the cargo - binding tail with elastic lever arms . The model allows us to derive the properties of a dimeric molecule , such as step size distribution , force - velocity relation and pro - cessivity , from the properties of an individual head , such as geometry , chemical kinetics and elasticity . In this re - spect the approach is diﬀerent from the class of discrete stochastic models , which describe the motor as a single unit [ 28 , 29 ] . We describe each head with a 5 - state mechano - chemical model , similar to that for muscle myosin ( e . g . , [ 30 ] ) , where each state ( with bound ADP . Pi , ADP ( pre - powerstroke ) , ADP ( post - powerstroke ) , without a nu - cleotide , detached ) is connected with a certain orienta - tion of the lever arm , as determined with electron mi - croscopy ( EM ) [ 18 , 19 ] . The lever arms are modeled as elastic beams , connected with a ﬂexible joint . A recent study measuring ﬂuctuations in the position of the free head [ 31 ] has demonstrated that the lead head diﬀuses around the joint freely before binding to the next actin site , meaning that there is no detectable elastic energy cost connected with variation in the angle between the two lever arms . The very nature of protein ﬂexibility , which mainly originates from the twisting of bonds be - tween carbon atoms in the backbone , leads us to the conclusion that the joint is also fully ﬂexible with regard to rotation of each lever arm along its axis . Similar ﬂex - ibility has also been observed in myosin II [ 32 , 33 , 34 ] . The calculation of the branching probability is simpli - 2 TABLE I : Geometric parameters of the Arp2 / 3 junction and a myosin V head .

First , we assume that the binding of the lead head always leads to a step , which means that its unbinding is signiﬁcantly slower than the step that follows in the regular cycle ( Pi release ) . Second , we assume that the probability for the lead head to bind to site j if the trail head is bound to site i is given by the Boltzmann factor P j | i = exp (cid:16) − U i , j k B T (cid:17) P j ′ exp (cid:16) − U i , j ′ k B T (cid:17) . ( 1 ) U i , j denotes the elastic energy of deformed lever arms when the trail head is in the post - powerstroke state , bound to site i , and the lead head in the pre - powerstroke state to site j . In the following , we will use the notation where the sites on the mother ﬁlament are marked with ( M , i ) and those on the daughter ﬁlament with ( D , i ) . For example , P D , 2 | M , − 9 denotes the conditional proba - bility for the lead head to bind to site 2 on the daughter ﬁlament if the trail head is bound to the site − 9 on the mother ﬁlament . We enumerate the actin subunits so that the central subunit under the Arp2 / 3 complex on the mother ﬁlament has the index 0 . Positive indices denote subunits towards the ” + ” end and negative to - wards the ” - ” end . Subunits of the daughter ﬁlament are enumerated from 0 onwards . Note that sites numbered - 2 , 0 and 2 on the mother ﬁlament are not accessible for a myosin V head , because of steric hindrance with the Arp2 / 3 complex . The structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex and both actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 1 ) has been determined from EM stud - ies [ 35 , 36 ] and its parameters are summarized in Table I . While we approximated actin with the commonly as - sumed 13 / 6 helix in the original paper [ 27 ] , we use a more accurate 28 / 13 helix here , with the angle θ 0 = 167 . 14 ◦ between adjacent subunits . A detailed discussion on dif - ferent helix models and their consequence for the calcu - lated step size distribution can be found in [ 37 ] .

( A ) The Arp2 / 3 complex is attached to the side of the mother ﬁl - ament occupying subunits - 2 , 0 and 2 . It nucleates the growth of a daughter ﬁlament , whose position is determined by the angles β ( branching angle ) , γ ( twist ) and r ( distance from the ﬁrst subunit to the center of the mother ﬁlament ) . ( B ) The myosin V motor is consists of two heads , connected with lever arms , which we describe as elastic rods . The proximal end of each lever arm always leaves the head at a ﬁxed angle φ , which depends on the nucleotide state of that head . The distal ends of both lever arms are connected with a fully ﬂexible joint . and the unit vector giving the initial direction of the lever arm are given by x 0 = R x ( − iθ 0 )   ia + δ 0 R   ˆ t 0 = R x ( − iθ 0 )   cos φ i 0 sin φ i   ( 2 ) where R x denotes the rotation matrix around the x axis , R x ( θ ) =   1 0 0 0 cos θ − sin θ 0 sin θ cos θ   ( 3 ) For a head bound to the daughter ﬁlament , the two vectors read x 0 = R y ( − β ) R x ( γ − iθ 0 )   r + ia + δ 0 R   ˆ t 0 = R y ( − β ) R x ( γ − iθ 0 )   cos φ i 0 sin φ i   ( 4 ) 3 with R y ( β ) =   cos β 0 sin β 0 1 0 − sin β 0 cos β   . ( 5 ) Here β = 70 ◦ denotes the angle between the mother and the daughter ﬁlament and γ = 39 ◦ the rotation of the daughter ﬁlament around its axis ( see Fig . 1 ) . We calculate the shapes of both lever arms as de - scribed in Ref . [ 27 ] by minimizing the bending energy U = R ds EI ( C ( s ) ) 2 / 2 , where C ( s ) denotes local curva - ture . For the bending modulus of the lever arm we use the value EI = 1500 pN nm 2 , which corresponds to a “spring constant” of κ = 3 EI / L 3 = 0 . 25 pN / nm , mea - sured at the tip of the lever arm . This value was orig - inally estimated from the stall force , but it shows good agreement with direct optical tweezer measurements [ 38 ] . We neglect any additional compliance resulting from the head or converter domain . Because most of the bending takes place in the proximal part of the lever arm , we ex - pect that its eﬀect would not be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent . For the temperature we use the value T = 27 ◦ C . III . RESULTS Stepping of myosin V in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex When a myosin V motor is suﬃciently far away from the Arp2 / 3 complex , it exhibits the stepping pattern that has already been discussed in Refs . [ 27 , 37 ] . We restrict the step lengths of an unperturbed motor to 11 , 13 and 15 subunits , with probabilities P 11 = P M , i + 11 | M , i ≈ 0 . 005 , ( 6 ) P 13 = P M , i + 13 | M , i ≈ 0 . 895 , ( 7 ) P 15 = P M , i + 15 | M , i ≈ 0 . 1 , ( 8 ) calculated from Eq . ( 1 ) . Probabilities for other step sizes , such as P 9 and P 17 turn out to be very small . Note that in this calculation P 11 and P 15 are likely to be somewhat underestimated - their values are somewhat higher if we take into account torsional ﬂuctuations in the actin helix [ 37 ] . The average step size can be calculated from these probabilities as ¯ l = 11 P 11 + 13 P 13 + 15 P 15 ≈ 13 . 2 . ( 9 ) In the absence of the Arp2 / 3 junction , the fraction of sites that get accessed by a passing myosin V motor is 1 / ¯ l . This is also the probability that a site before the junction ( i ≤ − 7 , as will be shown later ) ever gets accessed by the motor : P M , i = 1¯ l for i ≤ − 7 .

This way the initial state is deﬁnitely not inﬂuenced by the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex . By counting only the ﬁrst accessed site in this interval , we avoid double - counting of events where the motor binds , for example , ﬁrst to site - 17 and then to - 4 . We denote with P I , i the probability that once the ﬁrst head has bound to any subunit in the interval − 17 ≤ i ≤ − 3 , this has happened at subunit i . P I , i can be calculated in a way that is illustrated in Fig . 2 . The sites between - 17 and - 7 can only be reached from outside the interval . Therefore , whenever the motor binds to one of them , it becomes the ﬁrst accessed site in this interval . The probability P I , i then equals the probability that the site i ever gets accessed by the motor , which is 1 / ¯ l , according to Eq . ( 10 ) . For i = − 6 and higher the situation becomes diﬀerent . Site - 6 counts as the ﬁrst site in this interval if the preceding step size is 13 or 15 subunits , but not if it is 11 . Therefore , the corresponding probability is P I , − 6 = ( P 13 + P 15 ) / ¯ l . The probability that the ﬁrst site accessed in this interval is - 5 , P I , − 5 , has the same value . Finally , the sites - 4 and - 3 will be the ﬁrst accessed sites in the interval if they are following a 15 subunit step . Therefore , their probabilities are P I , − 4 = P I , − 3 = P 15 / ¯ l . The probabilities P I , i are given in the second column of Table II and shown in the top graph of Fig . 3 . 4 P 11 P 15 P 13 P 11 P + P 11 13 P + P 11 13 P 13 P I , −17 P I , −4 P I , −6 P I , −7 P I , −16 P J , −4 P J , −7 P J , −6 P J , −5 −16 −16 −16 −7 −31 −29 −27 −22 −7 −16 −6 −4 −17 −17 −17 −32 −30 −28 −17 −17 −6 −4 −17 −16 −16 −16 −5 −3 −1 −7 −7 −18 −20 −19 −21 −6 −6 −4 −19 −7 −6 −4 −5 FIG . 2 : Diﬀerent pathways on which a myosin V motor can approach the Arp2 / 3 junction . The probability distributions for the ﬁrst accessed site in the two intervals marked with dashed lines are denoted as P I , i and P J , i . P I , i represents the probability that i is the ﬁrst accessed site with − 17 ≤ i ≤ − 3 ( between dashed lines in the ﬁrst or second column ) . For values between − 17 and − 7 , this state can be reached with 3 diﬀerent step sizes . For i = − 6 and i = − 5 , it can be reached with 2 diﬀerent step sizes ( 13 and 15 ) . If it is reached by a shorter step ( 11 subunits ) , it means that the preceding binding site was already inside the interval − 17 . . . − 3 , so i is not the ﬁrst accessed site within it . For i = − 4 and i = − 3 , the site can only be reached with a 15 - subunit step . P J , i denotes the probability that i is the ﬁrst accessed subunit in the interval − 13 ≤ i ≤ 1 ( dashed lines in the right column ) . −17−16−15−14−13−12−11−10 −9 −8 −7 −6 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 −17−16−15−14−13−12−11−10 −9 −8 −7 −6 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 i P J , i P I , i FIG . 3 : Probability distribution P I , i ( upper diagram ) for the ﬁrst accessed binding site on the mother ﬁlament in the inter - val − 17 ≤ i ≤ − 3 . The lower diagram shows the probability distribution P J , i for the ﬁrst accessed site with − 13 ≤ i ≤ 1 . P J , i is calculated according to Eq . ( 11 ) , by redistributing the probabilities for − 17 to − 14 to other sites , as indicated by arrows . For example , if - 17 is the ﬁrst accessed site with − 17 ≤ i ≤ − 3 , the ﬁrst accessed site with − 13 ≤ i ≤ 1 can either be - 6 or - 4 . Note that the total probability that the motor binds to site - 4 is higher than for any other site , which is due to the inaccessibility of site - 2 . 5 FIG . 4 : Most probable lead head binding sites for diﬀerent trail head positions . For selected trail head binding sites i , a collection of lead head binding sites and their bending energies U i , j ( in units of k B T ) is shown . Some trail head positions which do not have signiﬁcant branching probabilities ( e . g . , − 12 ) are omitted . The shape of both lever arms in each conﬁguration is calculated numerically , by minimizing the bending energy . As a next step , we will derive the probability dis - tribution P J , i for the ﬁrst accessed site in the interval − 13 ≤ i ≤ 1 . We choose this interval because ( M , - 13 ) is the ﬁrst site from which the motor can reach the daugh - ter ﬁlament . This distribution can be obtained from P I , i by redistributing probabilities for sites between - 17 and - 14 according to the conditional probability for the next step P J , j = P I , j + − 14 X i = − 17 P M , j | M , i P I , i , ( 11 ) as shown in Fig . 3 . The values of P J , j are given in the third and fourth column of Table II . This distribution de - ﬁnes the state from which we will calculate the branching ratio at the Arp2 / 3 junction in the following section . Conditional branching ratio Now we can calculate the conditional probabilities that the lead head binds to the daughter ﬁlament , if the trail head is bound to a mother ﬁlament subunit i fulﬁlling − 13 ≤ i ≤ 1 . We denote this probability as P d | M , i . Figure 4 shows the most relevant dimer conﬁgurations with the trail head on mother ﬁlament sites between - 15 and 6 and the lead head either on mother or on daughter ﬁlament . For each trail head position , the conditional probability that the lead head binds to a certain site is given by Eq . ( 1 ) with the index j ′ running over all ac - 6 P D , 2 | M , −9 P J , −9 P M , 4 | M , −9 P D , 8 | M , 4 −9 2 −9 4 4 4 8 2 8 −9 FIG . 5 : An example of a one - step ( upper path ) and two - step ( lower path ) process through which the myosin V motor can reach the daughter ﬁlament . The probability that the trail head is bound to subunit ( M , - 9 ) in the initial state is P J , − 9 . In the next step , the lead head can bind to site ( D , 2 ) with conditional probability P D , 2 | M , − 9 . We denote such processes as one - step . Alternatively , the lead head can bind to the site ( M , 4 ) with conditional probability P M , 4 | M , − 9 and , subsequently , the other head can bind to site ( D , 8 ) with conditional probability P D , 8 | M , 4 . This is an example of a two - step process . Note that this scheme shows just two examples of possible pathways and omits alternatives that are indicated by dashed arrows . cessible mother - as well as daughter - ﬁlament sites – cor - responding to one row in Fig . 4 . Generally speaking , the daughter ﬁlament can either be reached directly , in a one - step process such as ( M , - 6 ) → ( D , 3 ) , or in a two - step process such as ( M , - 9 ) → ( M , 4 ) → ( D , 8 ) . Two examples are shown in Fig . 5 . The probability that a motor with the trail head bound to site ( M , i ) eventually binds to the daughter ﬁlament is P d | M , i = X j P D , j | M , i + X k P D , j | M , k P M , k | M , i ! . ( 12 ) Here the ﬁrst term denotes one - step processes and the second term two - step processes , where the motor ﬁrst binds to site k on the mother ﬁlament and subsequently to site j on daughter ﬁlament . Our numerical calcula - tion shows that the only signiﬁcant terms are those with k = 4 . The branching ratio P d | M , i for each trail head position is shown in Fig . 6 . The graph shows separately the contributions of one - and two - step processes . Total branching ratio With these probabilities and weights P J , i we ﬁnally obtain the branching ratio for the daughter ﬁlament : P d = 1 X i = − 13 P J , i P d | M , i ≈ 0 . 27 . ( 13 ) If one head binds to the daughter ﬁlament , there is still some probability that the next head will bind back to the mother ﬁlament . One such example , with the trail head on the site ( D , 1 ) , is shown in the last row in Fig . 4 . How - ever , the contribution of such events to the total branch - ing ratio is not signiﬁcant . - 13 - 12 - 11 - 10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Trail head position i 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % P d | M , i Mother Daughter : two - step Daughter : one - step FIG . 6 : Probability that the motor will step on and continue its walk along the daughter ﬁlament if the trail head is ini - tially bound to site i on the mother ﬁlament , P d | M , i ( black and hatched bars ) , as calculated from Eq .

The hatched bars show the contribution of two - step processes in which the motor ﬁrst binds to another site on the mother ﬁlament ( usually 4 ) and then in the second step to the daughter ﬁlament . The grey bars show the probability that the motor continues along the mother ﬁlament . IV . DISCUSSION While the exact result calculated above does require to take into account all the individual conﬁgurations , its order of magnitude can also be understood with a simple “handwaving” argument , which goes as follows . Roughly speaking , the approaching myosin V motor can either reach the Arp2 / 3 complex on the opposite side of the actin ﬁlament , in which case it cannot switch to the daughter ﬁlament , or on the same side , in which case the probability to switch to the daughter ﬁlament is about 1 / 2 . Together , this gives a branching ratio of 1 / 4 , not far from the exact result of 0 . 27 . An experiment measuring ( among other quantities ) the branching ratio at Arp2 / 3 mediated actin ﬁlament junc - 7 tions was recently carried out by Ali et al . [ 39 ] . The results are not directly comparable – in the experiment the actin ﬁlaments were attached to a glass surface so that some binding sites were not accessible for myosin V . However , because the blocked sites are diﬀerent depend - ing whether the side ﬁlament branches to the left or to the right , we expect that in statistical average , the calculated branching ratio still gives a good approximation . In the experiment 18 % of the molecules dissociated , 20 % con - tinued on the daughter ﬁlament , and 62 % on the mother ﬁlament . If we discount dissociation events , this means that the fraction that switched to the daughter ﬁlament was 24 % . The statistical error of this ﬁgure is about ± 5 % ( the total number of events observed was 76 ) . Therefore , the result can be considered in excellent agreement with the model calculation . Note that our calculation only concerns stepping pat - terns and does not take into account kinetics . This has an important advantage that the result only depends on geometric and elastic parameters , but not on kinetic con - stants , some of which are still less well known [ 27 ] . Com - bining the present model with the full kinetic scheme could inﬂuence the predicted branching ratio as follows . First , the binding rate of the lead head can be diﬀerent in the vicinity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . And second , the ADP release rate of the rear head can be inﬂuenced by in - tramolecular strain , possibly also by its lateral ( oﬀ - axis ) component , as observed by Purcell and coworkers [ 40 ] . Both these eﬀects do not have a direct inﬂuence on the branching ratio , but they might have an indirect one by inﬂuencing the dissociation probability . In the present calculation , events where the whole myosin V molecule dissociates from the actin ﬁlament are not taken into ac - count . There is , however , evidence that the predominant dissociation path leads through detachment of a head in the ADP state [ 23 , 41 ] – these processes are denoted as Pathway 2 in Ref . [ 27 ] . It is therefore plausible that the termination rate increases if either the lead head is hin - dered in its search for a binding site , or the ADP release in the trail head is slowed down . In our model ( see elastic energies in Fig . 4 ) , the lead head binding rate is strongly reduced if the trail head is bound to site − 13 , it is also re - duced somewhat if the trail head is bound to − 11 , while it is accelerated for trail head positions − 9 and 4 . In total , dissociation can be accelerated by the presence of the Arp2 / 3 junction in 2 out of ¯ l cases . Without going into quantitative details , one can conclude that the dis - sociation probability could theoretically increase by up to 2 / ¯ l ≈ 0 . 15 . The branching ratio for the daughter ﬁl - ament could then be somewhat smaller , because those trail head positions that have the higher branching ratio are also more likely to lead to dissociation . The eﬀect caused by the strain - dependent ADP release rate is more diﬃcult to estimate , mainly because the exact inﬂuence of oﬀ - axis strain on the ADP release is not yet known quantitatively . To check the robustness of our result against uncertain - ties in model parameters , we calculated the variation of 100 o 110 o 120 o 130 o φ pre - PS 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % P d 30 o 40 o 50 o 60 o 70 o φ post - PS φ pre - PS φ post - PS A 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 EI ( pNnm 2 ) 20 % 25 % 30 % 35 % 40 % P d B FIG . 7 : Dependence of the calculated branching ratio P d on diﬀerent model parameters . ( A ) Dependence on the lead head angle φ pre − PS ( solid line , lower scale ) and trail head angle φ post − PS ( dashed line , upper scale ) . ( B ) Dependence on the lever arm stiﬀness ( bending modulus ) EI . In both diagrams , the dot shows the value used in all other calculations through - out the article . the branching ratio with several model parameters . Note that these calculations were carried out numerically and took into account all relevant processes , including longer and shorter steps , as well as transitions not shown in Fig . 4 . Data in Fig . 7 shows a variation of about ± 10 % if either the lead head or the trail head angle is modiﬁed by ± 15 ◦ . The allowed variation of these two parameters that keeps the model consistent with the experimental result is therefore restricted , although parameter sets where both angles are increased or decreased simultaneously cannot be excluded . The result is more robust against variations in the lever arm stiﬀness EI , where deviations do not ex - ceed few percent if the value of EI is changed by a factor of 3 in either direction . We can therefore conclude that the calculated branch - ing ratio adds support to the elastic lever arm model presented in Ref . [ 27 ] and the geometric parameters used 8 there . However , we cannot use it as a criterion to de - termine the lever arm stiﬀness , which is still not known precisely . Another open question is to what extent the result can be reproduced with alternative models , such as Ref . [ 42 ] , which uses a more complex model for the elas - ticity of the lever arm , with a soft longitudinal ( about 1 / 3 of the value used there ) , but very stiﬀ azimuthal compo - nent . The completely diﬀerent class of “hot spot” mod - els , which proposes that the position of the next bind - ing site is determined by a propagating conformational change in the actin ﬁlament [ 43 ] , on the other hand , seems less compatible with the ﬁnding , unless the con - formational change could propagate through the Arp2 / 3 complex as well .
