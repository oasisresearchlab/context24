Daycare centers are critical infrastructures that cannot 3 be replaced , even during the COVID - 19 period . However , the existing settings in daycare centers may 4 pose risks of inevitable close contact between teachers and children , as well as fomite and airborne 5 transmission during care hours . Therefore , reinforced mitigation strategies have been applied in daycare 6 centers to reduce potential indoor virus transfer in many countries . However , numerous outbreaks of 7 COVID - 19 have been reported in daycare centers . Therefore , in this study , researchers focused on the 8 risk and behavior of long - distance virus transmission based on the detected viruses on air purifier filter 9 sampling in a daycare center outbreak in Korea . Various experiments of possible situations were 10 conducted in nursing rooms based on field interviews . The experiments monitored the long - distance 11 transmission behavior of aerosol - sized particles and visualized particle behavior at the daycare center . 12 The results of this study revealed that long - distance virus transmission is possible under the current 13 settings in the daycare center , and flush - out can be an important countermeasure with reinforced 14 ventilation methods to prevent potential airborne spread in the daycare center . The results of air purifiers 15 represented that air purifiers should be properly installed and operated in the daycare center to prevent 16 airborne virus spread by airflow during occupied hours . The findings of this study will contribute to the 17 understanding of airborne virus risk and the development of customized virus measures for daycare 18 centers . 19 20 21 Keywords 22 COVID - 19 , Long - distance transmission , Field investigation , Flush - out , Air purifier , Daycare center 23 24 25 Highlights 26 - The potential of the long - distance transmission in the daycare center was investigated 27 - The experiments in the potential sources represented the risk of the long - distance transmission 28 - Flush - out before and after use has a significant impact on lowering the long - distance transmission 29 - The wind directions of air purifiers are important to prevent aerosol transmission by direct airflow 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Funding 1 This research was supported by a fund ( fund code 202105082FD - 00 ) by Research of Korea Centers for 2 Disease Control and Prevention and the ‘National Research Council of Science & Technology ( NST ) ’ 3 - ‘Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology ( KICT ) ’ Postdoctoral Fellowship 4 Program for Young Scientists at KICT in South Korea . 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 1 . Introduction 1 After the pandemic , 307 million people were infected , and 5 . 5 million people died due to the SARS - 2 CoV - 2 viruses . As of January 10 th , 2022 , the number of daily COVID - 19 cases worldwide was 3 1 , 851 , 334 , which was a rebound from the numbers reported in October 2021 [ 1 ] . In Korea , recently , 4 more than 3 , 000 new patients with COVID - 19 have been reported since November 2021 [ 2 ] , and the 5 social distancing system was strengthened at level 4 in the metropolitan area [ 3 ] . In many types of 6 buildings , daycare centers are in charge of a significant part of the infrastructure [ 4 ] . Therefore , during 7 the COVID - 19 pandemic , daycare centers struggled to stay open and protect children from infectious 8 viruses while providing essential services for childcare . However , the continuing COVID - 19 outbreaks 9 in daycare centers made facility officials and parents weary with substantial burdens . 10 To date , three primary routes of SARS - CoV - 2 infection have dominated virus transfer : contact and 11 droplet transmission , fomite transmission , and airborne transmission [ 5 ] . Contact and droplet 12 transmission refers to SARS - CoV - 2 virus transmission through direct or indirect contact with bodily 13 secretions ( e . g . , saliva , respiratory droplets ) discharged from an infected person within a short - range 14 [ 6 – 8 ] . Respiratory droplet transmission can occur when people closely contact an infected person within 15 1 m [ 5 ] . This is the most common route of virus transmission . Fomite transmission represents an indirect 16 infection through touching or contacting surfaces contaminated by an infected person . Previous papers 17 found viruses on object surfaces in field samples of places where infected patients had been [ 9 , 10 ] . 18 However , there is still an argument about the possibility of this transmission route . Marsalek [ 11 ] 19 pointed out that ‘possible’ does not represent the extent of its ‘likelihood , ’ and Goldman [ 12 ] indicated 20 that the chance of fomite transmission is not significant . Airborne virus infection is a transmission route 21 through aerosol - sized droplet nuclei containing viruses from the carrier . Aerosols are typically equal to 22 or less than 5 μm in diameter , and they are exhaled through normal breathing and conversation [ 13 ] . In 23 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , viruses containing aerosols can float in the air and be delivered over long 24 distances [ 13 – 15 ] . Thereby , vulnerable people can become infected by inhaling aerosols if they are 25 exposed to enough viruses to cause infection [ 5 ] . Even though there have been many discussions on 26 infectivity and long - range transmission of aerosols in the scientific community , the World Health 27 Organization ( WHO ) has acknowledged the potential of airborne transmissions , such as in poorly 28 ventilated and / or crowded indoor environments [ 16 ] . Similarly , the U . S . Centers for Disease Control 29 and Prevention ( CDC ) recognized that the SARS - CoV - 2 virus could be transmitted across a six - feet 30 distance from infected people [ 17 ] . 31 Recent studies pointed out the impact of various air pollutants on airborne transmission and the fatality 32 rates of COVID - 19 . In a review study , Marquès and Domingo [ 18 ] found that long - term exposure to 33 potential air pollutants might give rise to a negative impact on the severity and the recovery period of 34 the SARS - CoV - 2 infectees . This study confirmed a significant relationship between exposure to 35 environmental air pollutants and the incidence and fatality of the SARS - CoV - 2 based on the scientific 36 evidence from previous articles . Kim et al . [ 19 ] discussed the potential risk of Particulate Matter ( PM ) 37 as a container of infectious diseases ( e . g . , COVID - 19 ) . This study represented a suggestion that the 38 national codes and standards should consider the monitoring of indoor air pollutants and control 39 guidelines for better indoor air quality controls in multi - use facilities . Maleki et al . [ 20 ] conducted a 40 systematic review of 167 studies ( 19 articles selected ) to identify the association between PM and 41 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . The researchers concluded that the positive role of PM was verified to 42 deliver viruses and promote airborne dispersion of COVID - 19 . Therefore , the risk of airborne 43 transmission should be carefully controlled , especially in daycare centers , to protect young children . 44 Regarding outbreaks in daycare centers , there are a lot of direct contacts with nursing teachers and the 45 potential chances of fomite infection ( e . g . , toys , books ) . Airborne transmission is possible since nursing 46 teachers and children spend several hours in closed spaces every day . For example , from January to 47 March 2021 in Korea , there were 36 cluster outbreaks in daycare centers and kindergartens , with a total 48 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 of 635 ( n = 17 . 6 cases / place ) confirmed cases . According to health authorities [ 21 ] , the risk factors in 1 daycare centers and kindergartens were the attendance of symptomatic patients , many close contact 2 activities ( e . g . , meals and play activities ) , and insufficient wearing of masks and indoor ventilation . 3 Therefore , health authorities have recommended no school attendance or prompt virus tests of people 4 suspected of being infected ( e . g . , fever , respiratory symptoms , etc . ) to prevent cluster infection . 5 However , despite many efforts , cluster outbreaks have been continuously reported in daycare centers . 6 Notably , the cluster infection in Sejong , Korea , provided indirect evidence of potential airborne virus 7 transmission in the daycare centers . In the R - daycare center , viruses were found on the air purifier 8 prefilters in sampling tests , including samples from a patient - free nursing room [ 22 ] . Further , in the 9 epidemiological investigation , there were no identified routes through direct contacts between infected 10 persons for inter - room transmission . 11 Therefore , the objective of this study is to investigate how the SARS - CoV - 2 virus can be transferred 12 from potential infectious sources to air purifiers in nursing rooms at the R - daycare center and identify 13 the mitigation performance under the current operation methods . Since apartments are the most 14 common residential type in Korea , the investigation of airborne virus transmission in the daycare center 15 of the apartment complex can be used to supplement the weakness of the COVID - 19 guides from health 16 authorities or operation methods of daycare centers during the pandemic . The transmission behavior of 17 virus - like substances was monitored based on the ventilation conditions in nursing rooms . The effects 18 of air purifier installation methods were assessed through a laser visualization experiment . Finally , 19 mitigation strategies were proposed to reduce COVID - 19 risk in daycare centers . 20 21 2 . Virus Transmission and Controls in Daycare Centers 22 2 . 1 Infection Controls in Daycare Centers 23 During the COVID - 19 pandemic , virus transmission and mitigation strategies for daycare centers have 24 been studied by numerous researchers and entities [ 19 , 23 – 27 ] . In Korea , the Ministry of Health and 25 Welfare ( MOHW ) has guided and updated responses to COVID - 19 for daycare centers . The latest 26 guidelines [ 24 , 28 ] require that daycare centers designate staff in charge of infectious disease control 27 and perform prevention activities of virus infection . Mitigation activities are also recommended for 28 daycare centers . For example , cleaning the main spaces , air filtering , and frequent natural ventilation 29 are encouraged during childcare hours to eliminate airborne contaminants . The direct wind from heating 30 and cooling systems and the recirculation of indoor air should be minimized . To prevent close contact 31 transmission , the spaces in daycare centers should be disinfected every day , and educational items and 32 stuff ( e . g . , toys , books ) with which children and childcare staff frequently come into contact should be 33 sterilized at least twice a day . During the childcare program , direct contact with children , staff , or 34 visitors is not recommended . Indoor and outdoor programs are expected to maintain at least one person 35 per 4 m 2 and the quarantine guidelines [ 24 , 28 ] . 36 Table 1 describes the COVID - 19 reopening measures for daycare centers from the health authorities 37 and previous literature [ 24 , 25 , 29 – 31 ] . In many countries , infectious disease controls to prevent SARS - 38 CoV - 2 have been stipulated for daycare centers and schools . The WHO has provided the prevention and 39 control measures to support preparation for COVID - 19 and to ensure the indoor safety of students and 40 teachers at schools [ 29 , 30 ] . The CDC has updated its “Guidance for Operating Child Care Programs 41 during COVID - 19” to supplement the legal systems ( e . g . , laws , rules , and regulations ) of federal and 42 regional public health and safety . This includes COVID - 19 prevention measures and guidance for child 43 care providers [ 25 , 27 ] . The federal state of Baden - Württemberg in Germany provided preventive 44 measures to stay healthy against the SARS - CoV - 2 virus when reopening schools and childcare facilities 45 in 2020 [ 31 ] . Key points of the above - mentioned control measures are early screening of potential 46 patients , contaminant removal and behavioral prevention methods , occupant density controls , and 47 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 control measures for primary transmission routes ( e . g . , close , fomite , and airborne transmission ) . 1 2 Table 1 .

The CDC’s Science Brief [ 4 ] reported that children and 3 adolescents could transmit contagious viruses to other people . The cumulative infection rates in children 4 aged 0 – 4 years are approximately half that of children aged 5 – 17 , which is almost equivalent to those 5 in seniors aged 65 years or older . In a study conducted by Lopez et al . [ 23 ] , researchers verified that 6 children in daycare centers are significant sources of virus transmission [ 23 , 32 , 33 ] , even though the 7 conditions of the 12 infected children observed in three daycare facilities were mild or asymptomatic . 8 In the contact tracing of 3 small to large child care facilities in Salt Lake County , Utah , 12 people were 9 infected due to contact with the children outside the daycare centers , including parents and siblings , 10 which represents the possibility of children transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 viruses to their parents and 11 teachers from daycare centers . On the contrary , in research in Finland , Haapanen et al . [ 34 ] confirmed 12 that social distancing ( e . g . , lockdown of schools and daycare ) could be helpful to reduce respiratory 13 diseases . The immediate impact of the closures in schools and daycare centers was found on the controls 14 of virus transmission , and the effect was maintained for several weeks . After the lockdown , the re - 15 opening of schools and daycare centers had no immediate impact on the outbreaks of any respiratory 16 pathogens . 17 Various studies have suggested that the incidence rates between children and adolescents are less than 18 between adults [ 35 – 39 ] , and deaths in infected children are rare [ 38 ] . In another study , Walger et al . [ 38 ] 19 pointed out that the lockdown of schools and daycare centers may have only a limited impact on the 20 further transmission of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus due to low symptoms and severity . This is because the 21 rate of symptomatic infections between children and adolescents is lower than among adults [ 38 , 40 , 41 ] , 22 and serious cases of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus are not common in the children group [ 4 ] . However , some 23 researchers have indicated that the lower rates of virus infection in children might be due to lower 24 exposure ( e . g . , school , daycare , and activity lockdown ) and virus testing opportunities compared to 25 adults [ 42 ] . 26 27 Table 2 . COVID - 19 Outbreaks in Daycare centers and Kindergartens [ 21 ] 28 Period ( 2021 . 1 . 1 – 2021 . 3 . 27 ) Total Jan 1 st – Feb 13 th Feb 14 th – Feb 20 th Feb 21 st – Feb 27 th Feb 28 th – Mar 6 th Mar 7 th – Mar 13 th Mar 14 th – Mar 20 th Mar 21 st – Mar 27 th Outbreak 36 13 6 4 4 3 2 4 Infected Cases ( A ) 635 202 92 77 66 50 66 82 Daycare Center Students 168 48 20 22 20 8 19 31 Staff 121 42 17 8 14 7 16 17 Subtotal ( B ) 289 90 37 30 34 15 35 48 ( B / A ) ( 45 . 5 ) ( 44 . 6 ) ( 40 . 2 ) ( 39 . 0 ) ( 51 . 5 ) ( 30 . 0 ) ( 53 . 0 ) ( 58 . 5 ) Out of Daycare Center Additional Spread 346 112 55 47 32 35 31 34 29 In the statistics from Korea after the pandemic , the confirmed cases for ages 0 – 9 children were 12 , 543 30 ( 5 . 16 % ) of total cumulative confirmed cases ( n = 243 , 317 ) , and there were no deaths or severe cases 31 ( as of August 27 , 2021 ) [ 43 ] . Nevertheless , 36 cluster outbreaks have occurred since January 2021 , with 32 a total of 635 confirmed cases related to daycare centers and kindergartens ( Table 2 ) . Among all 33 confirmed cases , indoor transmission in the daycare facilities was 45 . 5 % ( n = 289 / 635 cases ) , and the 34 additional transmission out of the daycare facilities was 54 . 5 % ( n = 346 / 635 cases ) . The main 35 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 transmission route was nursing teachers and students . They were infected in external facilities ( e . g . , 1 homes , academies , churches , multi - use facilities ) . Then , infected teachers and students spread infectious 2 particles to other teachers and students as virus containers in daycare centers and kindergartens . Newly 3 infected teachers and students transmitted contagious viruses to their household members and 4 acquaintances . In total in - house cases , the rate of daycare staff was 41 . 9 % ( n = 121 / 289 cases ) , and the 5 rate of infected students was 58 . 1 % ( n = 168 / 289 cases ) [ 21 ] . Therefore , in order to prevent the spread 6 of SARS - CoV - 2 in daycare centers , daycare centers should minimize the transfer from outside through 7 reinforced virus measures , including regular body temperature checks and preemptive virus tests . 8 Further , mitigation methods ( e . g . , natural ventilation , air purification , and sterilization ) should be 9 appropriately operated to remove infectious contaminants in the air and on the surfaces of objects to 10 ensure a safe indoor environment in daycare centers . 11 12 3 . Methodology 13 3 . 1 Facility Overview 14 The case building of this study is a COVID - 19 cluster outbreak facility in May 2021 . The index case of 15 the cluster outbreak was a teacher in a nursing room ( NR ) - 2 ( age 2 ) and an asymptomatic case . She was 16 discovered through a preemptive examination by the facility on May 22 , 2021 . The first symptomatic 17 person in the epidemiological investigation was a toddler ( age 2 ) studying in NR3 ( age 2 ) , and the 18 COVID - 19 symptom appeared on May 16 , 2021 . The case of the first symptomatic person was 19 confirmed on May 23 after 6 days through Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) test . Also , in the 20 epidemiological investigation , 9 people ( 4 young children , 2 teachers , 3 family members ) already had 21 symptoms before the index case was reported , but they did not recognize it as COVID - 19 . As of June 22 18 , 2021 , a total of 28 cases were found in the R - daycare center , including 7 teachers , 13 students , and 23 8 teachers’ and students’ family members . Also , within the facility ( family infection excluded ) , the 24 attack rate of COVID - 19 in the daycare center was 18 . 7 % ( n = 20 / 107 ) . The primary case was not clearly 25 identified in an epidemiologic investigation by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency 26 ( KDCPA ) [ 22 ] . 27 In terms of this daycare center , the KDCPA implemented the COVID - 19 sampling of objects . A total of 28 7 out of 36 samples from the surfaces of objects ( e . g . , desk , mat , sleeping gear , doorknob ) in nursery 29 rooms and toilets were positive ( 19 . 4 % , 7 / 36 ) , and 6 out of 8 samples from the prefilters in air purifiers 30 confirmed virus - positive ( 75 . 0 % , 6 / 8 ) . In particular , the viruses were detected on the prefilters of the 31 air purifiers in nursing rooms , including NR2 ( age 1 ) , which had no patients [ 22 ] . This implies the 32 potential for long - distance airborne virus transmission in the daycare center . 33 In the field survey , daycare teachers spent the most daytime with their children without transferring to 34 adjacent classrooms . Teachers also ate meals in classrooms with infants and toddlers . Most nursing 35 rooms had awning - type windows , but some spaces ( e . g . , playrooms , offices ) had no windows for 36 ventilation . The epidemiologic investigation [ 22 ] surmised that fomite transmission ( e . g . , toy ) , contact 37 transmission ( e . g . , singing , dancing , physical activity ) , and airborne virus transmission could be the 38 potential routes of this cluster infection . However , the transmission routes of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus 39 from the first symptomatic case ( NR3 ; age 2 ) or index case ( NR2 ; age 2 ) to distant classrooms remained 40 unclear . Therefore , this study focused on the possibility of far - reaching indoor airborne contaminant 41 transmission to prevent cluster outbreaks in daycare centers . 42 The R - daycare center was located on the podium floor ( 1 st floor ) of an apartment building in Sejong , 43 Korea . It was a single - story daycare center consisting of 7 nursing rooms , an office , a counseling room , 44 a playroom , a reference room , and a kitchen with a total building area of 243m 2 . The operating hours 45 of the daycare center were 7 : 30 a . m . to 7 : 30 p . m . ( 12 hours ) on weekdays . A total of 106 occupants ( 79 46 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 infants and toddlers , 22 daycare teachers , and 5 external instructors ) were registered in the daycare 1 center for 13 classes ( 0 – 3 years old ) . 2 3 Table 3 .

R - Daycare Center Plan and Cluster Infection Cases 7 8 In terms of building systems , the heating and cooling systems were electric heat pump ( EHP ) systems 9 mounted on the ceiling , and wall - mounted fans were also installed in nursing rooms as auxiliary cooling 10 systems . Before the COVID - 19 outbreak , cooling systems were not operated at the daycare center . The 11 center was not equipped with mechanical ventilation systems , and thus natural ventilation through 12 windows was the only way to introduce fresh outdoor air into nursing rooms during the pandemic . To 13 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 supplement this , air purifiers were installed in each nursing room to improve indoor air quality . The air 1 purifier in the nursing rooms was a 75 m 2 - type product with dual fans and three - stage air filtering , 2 including 1 ) microfiber prefilter , 2 ) double deodorization filter , and 3 ) all - in - one composite filter 3 ( deodorization + fine particulate matter ) and stand - alone air purifiers were installed in the hallway , 4 nursing room # 1 , and playroom . The air filters were replaced by the manufacturer’s service every two 5 months . Before the COVID - 19 outbreak , the daycare center typically opened windows for natural 6 ventilation and operated air purifiers during the daytime . The details of the facility and cluster outbreaks 7 are provided in Table 3 and Figure 1 . 8 9 3 . 2 Experiment Design and Environmental Conditions 10 This study tested the possibility of the long - distance spread of airborne viruses into adjacent classrooms 11 in the R - daycare center . To this end , the researchers attempted to identify the potential transmission 12 routes of airborne viruses on the air purifier prefilters that were found in samples . The air filtering 13 performance of the virus - like particles was also investigated because air purifiers were the only 14 available additional mitigation system , along with natural ventilation , in the daycare center . 15 The experiment was conducted from June 1 st to 2 nd , 2021 . The indoor and outdoor environmental 16 conditions during the experiment are shown in Figure 2 . According to the Korea Meteorological 17 Administration ( KMA ) , the outdoor temperature on these days was 22 . 3 – 29 . 4 o C , and the external 18 relative humidity was 36 – 92 % . The external wind speed was 0 . 0 – 2 . 5m / s [ 44 ] . The measured indoor 19 temperature ( sensor 1 , hallway ) was 22 . 6 – 25 . 0 o C during the monitoring . The outdoor weather 20 conditions during the experiments were similarly maintained compared to the pre - symptomatic period 21 ( May 13 - 15 , Table 4 ) . In May , when COVID - 19 occurred at the R - daycare center , the efficiency of 22 natural ventilation seasonally decreased . The air temperature differences between indoors and outdoors 23 were smaller than those in winter due to the air temperature rise in the spring season . Thus , in the case 24 study building , outdoor air would not be sufficiently introduced in the spring , and the indoor airflow 25 would be stagnant during the virus spread period . 26 27 28 Figure 2 .

Airborne Transmission Experiment in a Case Daycare Center 5 6 Therefore , indoor airborne virus transmission between hallways and adjacent classrooms was traced 7 using virus - like particles in this study . Virus - like particles were sprayed in the potential virus sources 8 ( e . g . , index case , first symptomatic patient , teacher’s meeting ) . In addition , the potential risk of no flush - 9 out before and after space use was explored by monitoring unoccupied hours . This result shows the 10 significance of flush - out for occupants the next day . For the experiment , an oil droplet generator , a smog 11 generator , IAQ sensors , laser equipment , and various other sensors were utilized . A total of 10 air quality 12 sensors were installed to detect virus - like particles in the nursing rooms and hallway . IAQ sensors can 13 measure 0 . 3 – 10 µ m particles with 98 % counting efficiency ( ≥ 0 . 5 µ m ) . Aerosol - sized particles were 14 sprayed at 10 psi using a Laskin nozzle oil droplet generator ( TSI Model 9307 ) that can release aerosol - 15 sized oil particles with mean diameter of 1 . 0 µ m and 30 l / min of the aerosol flow rate under normal 16 operation ( 25 psi ) in the air [ 45 ] . Laser visualization experiments were also performed to compare 17 installation methods for air purifiers . The laser visualization observation showed the behavior of virus - 18 like particles in the air using a smog generator . 10W and 5W diode - pumped solid - state ( DPSS ) laser 19 was used to generate the laser sections with a fog generator ( SAFEX , Model F2010 ) . The laser sections 20 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 visualize the real - time behavior of virus - like particles from an air contaminant source . Testo 405 - V1 1 was used to record wind speed and air temperature in the outdoor environment . Testo 400 was installed 2 in NR3 ( age 2 ) to document indoor temperature and humidity . Figure 3 shows the environmental 3 conditions of this study . 4 5 4 . Potential of Long - Distance Transmission 6 In the case building , long - distance airborne propagation was conjectured as a virus route because several 7 infected cases in different classrooms were far from the index case ( age 43 , teacher ) and the first 8 symptomatic toddler ( age 2 , student ) . Since there were no clear close contacts between daycare teachers 9 and children in different classrooms during the open hours , identifying the potential for long - distance 10 transmission could be helpful in understanding the COVID - 19 outbreak routes in the daycare center . 11 Therefore , in this section , several scenarios were tested to verify the potential risks of the spread of 12 long - distance viruses . 13 14 4 . 1 Contaminant Behavior under the Current Operations 15 The primary case of the R - daycare center outbreak was not identified in the epidemiological 16 investigation by the KDCPA . Hence , this study tested suspicious virus sources , such as NR3 ( age 2 ) , 17 where the first symptomatic patient ( age 2 ) was found . According to the on - site interview , during the 18 daycare hours , the classroom doors were closed , the windows were opened , and the air purifier and 19 restroom fan were turned on in May 2021 . After daytime classes ( after 4 p . m . ) , the daycare center was 20 regularly cleaned for about 30 min before the extended daycare classes began . During cleaning time , 21 the windows and classroom doors were open , and the air purifiers and restroom fans were turned off . 22 Therefore , the experiment in this section included two parts of operating conditions in the R - daycare 23 center ( Table 5 ) : regular class conditions and afternoon cleaning time conditions ( Figure 4 and Table 6 ) . 24 In Figure 4 ( a ) , the virus spread from the infected location was tested in the classroom using an oil 25 droplet generator . The virus - like particles were generated into NR3 ( age 2 ) for 20 min to simulate 26 airborne virus transmission under normal class operating conditions . In Figure 4 ( b ) , 40 min of 27 observation after Figure 4 ( a ) shows how airborne virus - like particles can be spread in the R - daycare 28 center during the afternoon cleaning time when the infected patient left the classroom . During the 29 experiment , the indoor room temperature ( T db ) of NR3 ( age 2 ) was 22 . 7 – 24 . 5℃ , and the relative 30 humidity ( RH ) was 58 . 3 – 64 . 4 % . Outdoor weather was 24 . 0 o C and RH 62 % , and wind speed and wind 31 direction were 1 . 7 m / s and 140 degrees , respectively [ 44 ] . 32 Figure 4 and Table 6 show the patterns of airborne transmission under the actual ventilation conditions 33 in the R - daycare center . In Figure 4 ( a ) , when virus - like substances were sprayed with the regular 34 classroom conditions for 20 min , the virus - like substances were transferred from NR3 ( age 2 ) to NR2 35 ( age 2 ) through a shared restroom ( IAQ # 2 ) . In the corridor ( IAQ # 3 ) adjacent to NR3 ( age 2 ) , the 36 concentration of virus - like particles increased from 36 to 715 µg / m 3 . This confirmed that virus - like 37 particles could diffuse into the hallway due to air leakage through the door gaps . In terms of the 38 possibility of long - distance transmission , the concentration of NR1 ( age 1 ) ( IAQ # 7 ) , 29 . 5 m away from 39 the test site , increased by 33 µg / m 3 compared to before the experiment . In particular , after 19 min , the 40 particle concentration increased from 14 to 29 µg / m 3 in NR1 ( age 1 ) ( IAQ # 7 ) , which indicates that 41 virus - like particles can reach long distances through the air . However , the ratio of reaching virus - like 42 substances is relatively low compared to air contaminant sources . 43 44 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 Table 5 .

Airborne Contaminant Transmission from Nursing Room3 ( Age 2 ) 4 5 By contrast , 40 min of monitoring was conducted for airborne diffusion during cleaning time . The virus - 6 like particle concentrations of NRs 2 – 3 ( age two ) and adjacent spaces were reduced due to natural 7 ventilation and airborne transmission to the neighboring spaces . The concentrations of virus - like 8 particles in the long - distance nursing rooms increased due to dispersion by indoor airflow movement , 9 as shown in Figure 4 ( b ) . This result indicates that virus - like particles could reach other adjacent spaces 10 in a 40 - min period under ventilation conditions during cleaning time . During the cleaning time , the 11 reduction rate of virus - like particles was 76 . 5 % in NR3 ( age 2 ) . Since the existing literature 12 recommends at least 95 % virus removal through outdoor air for safety [ 46 ] , the current removal 13 performance was not sufficient to lower airborne virus concentration and control airborne virus transfer 14 between indoor spaces . Above all , all multi - rooms in the daycare center were connected by the central 15 corridor , which limited natural ventilation performance during the daytime . Therefore , to sufficiently 16 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 mitigate airborne contaminants , the daycare center should extend the ventilation hours in the cleaning 1 time or install mechanical systems to increase the outdoor air ventilation rates in nursing rooms . 2 3 Table 6 .

In the outbreak of the R - daycare center , there were several potential virus sources , such 9 as nursing room ( NR ) - 2 ( age 2 ) , NR3 ( age 2 ) , and NR ( age 3 ) . Among these , NR3 ( age 2 ) was tested in 10 Section 4 . 1 . Thus , in this section , NR2 ( age 2 ) , where the index case stayed , and NR ( age 3 ) , where 11 daycare teachers had a meeting ( May 17 th ) , were tested as potential virus sources . To trace the possible 12 spread of contagious viruses , this study conducted an experiment with ventilated conditions ( Table 7 ) 13 since , typically , classrooms operated natural ventilation and air purifiers before the outbreak . For these 14 experiments , virus - like particles were sprayed at 20 psi for 20 min using an oil droplet generator . In 15 NR2 ( age 2 ) , the indoor air temperature ( T db ) was 24 . 0 – 24 . 9°C , and the relative humidity was 51 . 3 – 16 57 . 3 % . In NR ( age 3 ) , the room temperature was 24 . 4 – 25 . 0°C , and the relative humidity was 50 . 2 – 52 . 8 % 17 during the monitoring . External air conditions in the experiment of NR2 ( age 2 ) were 25 . 9°C , and RH 18 44 % with a wind speed of 1 . 1 m / s and a wind direction of 290 degrees , and outdoor conditions in NR 19 ( age 3 ) were 26 . 5 o C and RH 42 % with a wind speed of 0 . 9 m / s and a prevailing wind direction of 20 20 degrees [ 44 ] .

Airborne Contaminant Transmission to Adjacent Nursing Rooms 5 6 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 In Figure 5 ( a ) , the experiment of airborne virus spread in NR2 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 5 ) represents when an 1 infected person exhales the infectious viruses indoors . In the results , the virus - like substances reached 2 all the nursing rooms within 20 min through indoor airflow , although the concentrations of virus - like 3 substances varied . The highest concentrations were found in the shared restroom ( IAQ # 2 ) , NR2 ( age 4 2 ) , and hallways ( IAQ # 3 ) , neighboring with NR3 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 1 ) . These indicate that when the index 5 case occupied NR2 ( age 2 ) , the airborne transmission was likely to occur between neighboring nursing 6 rooms . Within 12 – 13 min after the virus - like particle ejection , increments in particle concentrations 7 were observed in NR1 ( age 1 ) ( IAQ # 7 ) and NR ( age 0 ) ( IAQ # 8 ) . Compared with the concentration of 8 NR2 ( age 2 ) , the reaching rates in NR1 ( age 1 ) ( IAQ # 7 ) and NR ( age 0 ) ( IAQ # 8 ) at the peak time were 9 14 . 2 % ( 198 / 1 , 392 µg / m 3 ) and 11 . 6 % ( 161 / 1 , 392 µg / m 3 ) , respectively . However , the virus - like particles 10 took approximately 19 min to reach NR2 ( age 1 ) , so the speed of airborne diffusion was relatively slow . 11 During the outbreak period , the only chance that daycare teachers could have close contact was the 12 teachers’ meeting in NR ( age 3 ) ( IAQ # 9 ) . In the observation of Figure 5 ( b ) , when virus - like particles 13 were diffused in NR ( age 3 ) , particles could spread out more easily than in Figure 5 ( a ) due to natural 14 ventilation from outside . The spread time to reach NR2 ( age 2 ) and NR3 ( age 2 ) , which are the most 15 distant spaces from NR ( age 3 ) ( IAQ # 9 ) , was about 6 min . This indicates that long - distance transmission 16 from NR ( age 3 ) was much faster compared to the experiment of NR2 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 5 ) in Figure 5 ( a ) . 17 In addition , the reaching rates at the peak time were 16 . 1 % ( 237 / 1 , 469 µg / m 3 ) and 17 . 2 % ( 262 / 1 , 522 18 µg / m 3 ) for NR2 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 5 ) and NR3 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 1 ) , respectively , which was higher than that of 19 the virus - like particle transmission of NR2 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 5 ) . Therefore , the potential for long - distance 20 transmission should not be overlooked , even when providing natural ventilation and operating air 21 purifiers during the open hours in the daycare center . 22 23 24 4 . 3 Contaminant Accumulation during Unoccupied Hours 25 During the COVID - 19 period , health authorities and professional societies recommended flush - out 26 before and after space occupancy . Similarly , the Ministry of Health and Welfare ( MOHW ) [ 24 ] 27 encourages natural ventilation before and after occupancy in daycare centers , but there is no specific 28 guidance for flush - out operations ( e . g . , required ventilation volume , operating methods ) . Thus , the 29 impact of natural ventilation before and after occupancy in daycare centers is not clear . In general , 30 daycare centers in Korea have 12 hours of unoccupied time , from 7 : 30 p . m . to 7 : 30 a . m . before open 31 hours . If air contaminants are not fully removed after use , they may remain in the indoor air until the 32 next morning . In the field study , the R - daycare center performed natural ventilation before class hours 33 and during cleaning time . However , whether the virus transmission at an unoccupied time was prevented 34 was not identified in the epidemiological investigation of the entire daycare center . 35 Therefore , this experiment monitored how virus - like particles could be transmitted to neighboring 36 rooms during the unoccupied time when an infected patient exhaled infectious viruses during the 37 daytime , and no flush - out was conducted after space use . Table 9 shows the unoccupied time conditions 38 when the daycare center closed . The test was carried out in NR ( age 3 ) ( IAQ # 9 ) , and the particles were 39 ejected at 20 psi for 15 min . The concentration change of airborne particles in the daycare center was 40 observed for 15 hours from the evening to the next morning . At this time , the indoor environmental 41 conditions in NR ( age 3 ) were 23 . 3 – 25 . 0℃ of air temperature and 50 . 3 – 58 . 6 % of relative humidity . 42 Outside air conditions were 17 . 4 – 25 . 9 o C of indoor air and RH 43 – 79 % . Wind speed and direction in 43 the outdoor environment were 0 . 0 – 1 . 6 m / s and 70 – 320 degrees , respectively [ 44 ] . 44 45 46 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 Table 9 .

In particular , in NR2 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 5 ) and 3 NR3 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 1 ) , which are farthest from the virus source ( NR ( age 3 ) , the extent of changes was 4 not notable during the over 12 hours . In NR2 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 5 ) and NR3 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 1 ) , the 5 concentration of virus - like particles peaked after 3 hours from the ejection start , and then the density of 6 particles decreased only up to 29 . 4 – 30 . 5 % after 9 hours . In overnight monitoring , NR ( age 3 ) ( IAQ # 9 ) 7 showed 65 . 8 % of the reduction rate compared to the peak concentration during 12 hours . However , the 8 total concentration reduction of virus - like particles ( Figure 6 ( b ) ) from all measured indoor spaces was 9 only 38 % during 12 hours and 44 % during 14 hours after the peak value through air leakage . The 10 decrease in the total concentration of the daycare center implies that the virus - like particles sprayed 11 from NR ( age 3 ) ( IAQ # 9 ) were diffused to other adjacent spaces during unoccupied nighttime . This 12 result also indicates that the airborne virus can be trapped in nursing rooms during the unoccupied time . 13 Thus , if effective measures are not applied in the nursing rooms before and after occupancy , particles 14 would be transferred to the other rooms over long distances during nighttime . This means that teachers 15 and students in the daycare centers can be exposed to infectious diseases the next day through nighttime 16 long - distance transmission without direct contact with the infected person . Therefore , sufficient 17 ventilation before and after space use can be helpful in preventing residual airborne contaminants 18 transfer before reopening the facility the following day . 19 20 5 . Mitigation Performance of the R - Daycare Center 21 In the R - daycare center , the cluster infection of SARS - CoV - 2 occurred in May 2021 . Before the 22 outbreak , this facility complied with the government’s quarantine guidelines , such as frequent natural 23 ventilation , everyday body temperature checks , wearing masks , and restrictions on visits from outsiders . 24 Further , the R - daycare center opened windows and operated the air purifiers in auto mode during class 25 time . Despite such efforts , cluster infections occurred in the daycare center . Therefore , this section 26 evaluated the removal trends of virus - like particles in nursing rooms and investigated the impact of air 27 purifiers on airborne transmission as an alternative measure for virus mitigation in daycare centers . 28 29 5 . 1 Contaminant Removal Trends 30 The R - daycare center had continuously ventilated the classrooms through windows and filtered indoor 31 air using wall - mounted and stand - alone air purifiers to improve air quality during open hours . However , 32 the performance of mitigation strategies can vary depending on the indoor and outdoor environment . 33 Therefore , to verify this , this section monitored the concentrations of virus - like particles from NR ( age 34 3 ) ( IAQ # 9 ) and NR2 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 5 ) for 40 min after 20 min of virus - like particles sprayed in Section 35 4 . 2 . During the experiment , windows , and doors were opened , and the air purifiers operated in strong 36 mode . Figure 7 and Table 11 show the virus removal trends in NR ( age 3 ) ( IAQ # 9 ) and NR2 ( age 2 ) 37 ( IAQ # 5 ) . Since environmental differences affect the airborne transmission of virus - like particles 38 depending on the location of the virus ejection source ( e . g . , NR , age 3 ( IAQ # 9 ) and NR2 , ( age 2 ) 39 ( IAQ # 5 ) ) , mitigation impacts of natural ventilation and air purifiers can be differentiated in nursing 40 rooms . For example , in Figure 7 ( a ) , the concentrations of virus - like substances in NR ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 5 ) 41 were reduced within 20 min in most spaces . However , since NR - age 3 ( IAQ # 9 ) represented a faster 42 indoor diffusion rate than NR - age 2 ( IAQ # 5 ) , several spaces could not be completely mitigated within 43 40 min . Therefore , in order to prevent cluster infection through airborne contaminant transmission in 44 daycare centers , it is important to develop customized plans for the facilities , including ventilation hours 45 or rates based on the actual spread and removal rates in indoor spaces . For this , additional mechanical 46 ventilation devices or new ventilation windows should be considered for the daycare center . 47 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 19 1 Figure 7 .

Long - distance 4 transmission from potential virus sources was simulated using aerosol - sized particles and sensor 5 monitoring in nursing rooms . Typically , spring in Korea is dry and warm , and thus , the efficiency of 6 natural ventilation is lowered due to the reduced air temperature differences between indoors and 7 outdoors . Therefore , natural ventilation may not be sufficient in facilities without mechanical 8 ventilation systems or air filtering devices . Previous studies have verified the effectiveness of high - 9 performance air filters in alleviating the potential transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 47 – 50 ] . However , the 10 impact of the air purifier on virus removal performance is affected by the operating modes . Therefore , 11 an experiment was conducted to evaluate the filtering performance in NR3 ( age 2 ) ( IAQ # 1 ) , where the 12 first symptomatic patient was found . The concentration fluctuations of the virus - like particles were 13 measured according to the operating modes ( e . g . , strong , weak , off ) using a wall - mounted air purifier . 14 The windows and doors were closed during the experiment to exclude the influence of natural 15 ventilation . The virus - like particles were sprayed at 20 psi for 20 min using the oil droplet generator , 16 and then the particle removal performance was measured for 40 min . Indoor environmental conditions 17 during the monitoring were 23 . 3 – 25 . 5°C of room temperature and 48 . 8 – 56 . 7 % of relative humidity . 18 Table 12 shows the case scenarios for the air purifier used in this study . 19 20 Table 12 . Experiment Scenarios for Air Purifiers 21 Scenarios Ventilation and Air Filtering Conditions Source Location Features Windows Air purifiers Room doors Restroom fans NR3 ( Age2 ) : IAQ # 1 No air purifier All closed Off All closed Off Air purifier ( strongest mode ) All closed On ( S ) All closed Off Air purifier ( weakest mode ) All closed On ( W ) All closed Off 22 23 Figure 8 . Impact of the Air Purifier on Airborne Contaminant Mitigation 24 25 Figure 8 and Table 13 show the time - series transfer and summary of the virus - like substances when the 26 air purifier was operated in three different modes in NR3 ( age 2 ) : 1 ) off , 2 ) strong ( S ) mode , and 3 ) 27 weak ( W ) mode . In the weak ( W ) mode , the concentration of virus - like particles was reduced by about 28 27 % after 1 hour compared to the condition with no air purifier . In the strong ( S ) mode , the wall - 29 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 21 mounted air purifier confirmed an approximately 86 % reduction in aerosol - sized particles . This 1 evidence of operating modes verified that air purifiers were effective for infectious virus controls 2 compared to the 5 . 8 % reduction with the no air purifier . Although the impact of air purifiers can vary 3 depending on installation methods and capacity , air purifiers can be regarded as an alternative to 4 alleviate the spread of infectious substances and supplement insufficient outdoor air fractions during 5 opening hours at the R - daycare center . 6 7 Table 13 .

The risk of direct wind from HVAC 12 systems has been identified and discussed in several studies [ 14 , 51 ] and guidance [ 52 – 54 ] . Therefore , 13 in this section , the impact of installation methods on transmission behavior was verified using the laser 14 visualization experiment using a stand - alone air purifier . In the R - daycare center , two types of air 15 purifiers were used , such as a wall - mounted type in most nursing rooms and stand - alone types installed 16 in the hallway , nursing room # 1 , and playroom . Since the wall - mounted air purifiers were already 17 installed above the height of the child and their wind direction avoid occupants , the stand - alone air 18 purifier was selected and tested for improvements on installation and operations . 19 Figure 9 shows the visualized diffusion characteristics of virus - like particles between a stand - alone air 20 purifier and air contaminant sources . Figure 9 ( a ) shows the behavior of virus - like particles when the 21 virus source was located in the lower front of the air purifier . In this case , most of the virus - like particles 22 were out of the exhaust path for purified air from the outlet grill . Therefore , most airborne contaminants 23 were sucked into inlet pores for filtering , and then the purified air was discharged into the indoor air . 24 However , the result in Figure 9 ( b ) shows the potential risk of virus transmission boosted by the air 25 purifier . When virus - like particles were scattered in the exhaust path of the diffuser grill , direct airflow 26 from the grill pushed the airborne contaminants into the indoor space without filtration . Therefore , to 27 reduce the potential risk of installation and operation methods in air purifiers during the pandemic , the 28 air purifier should be installed higher than the height at which people breathe , or its outlet direction 29 could be set to avoid occupants . These implications can help ensure the effectiveness of the air purifier 30 with virus safety in closed spaces . 31 32 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 22 1 Figure 9 . Impact of Infection Source Location on Air Purifier Operations 2 3 6 . Discussion 4 In this study , we explored experimental evidence of airborne virus transmission from a COVID - 19 5 cluster infection in the R - daycare center in Sejong , Korea . To achieve the research goals , virus - like 6 particles were used as potential virus infection sources . The concentration of the virus - like particles was 7 traced in real - time to monitor airborne transmission and contaminant removal rates by natural 8 ventilation and air purifiers in the experiments . In addition , the removal performance of the air purifiers 9 was confirmed using particle concentration and laser visualization observation , depending on the 10 ventilation and air purifier operation modes . Even though the R - daycare center fully complied with 11 governmental quarantine actions of health authorities before the outbreak ( e . g . , fever checks , 12 disinfection , personal protection equipment , and limited visits of external visitors ) , the COVID - 19 13 outbreak could not be prevented in the daycare center . This fact implies that further research and effort 14 are thoroughly required to improve virus safety in multi - use facilities , such as daycare centers . For 15 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 23 example , the risk from Indoor and outdoor air contaminants should also not be overlooked to ensure the 1 occupant’s health , which can influence the airborne virus transmission and severity / mortality of 2 infectees . Therefore , this study investigated the potential of far - reaching air transmission based on the 3 fact of surface sampling in the epidemiological investigation in the daycare center . The key findings are 4 summarized as follows . 5 1 ) In the transmission from the nursing room ( NR3 age 2 ) where the first symptomatic patient was 6 found , the virus - like particles spread over a long distance to the adjacent spaces through the indoor 7 airflow . In the R - daycare center , outdoor air ventilation was limited due to small opening areas in the 8 awing - type windows and no mechanical ventilation systems . The current indoor environment might 9 influence the extended floating time of the virus - like particles in the air and the prolonged exposure of 10 occupants in the nursing rooms . 11 2 ) To evaluate the unoccupied hours ( e . g . , cleaning time ( about 30 min after 4 p . m . ) , unoccupied time 12 at night ( 7 : 30 p . m . – 7 : 30 a . m . ) ) , the concentrations of the virus - like particles were monitored during the 13 night after spraying aerosol - sized contaminants at 5 p . m . on June 1 st to the next morning June 2 nd in the 14 closed space . After 15 hours , the researchers found that 34 . 2 – 71 . 7 % of these airborne virus - like particles 15 remained in the rooms compared to the peak time concentrations . The next morning , concentrations of 16 virus - like substances were equalized in most spaces without complete removal . This indicates that when 17 airborne contaminants are not sufficiently eliminated after use or before reopening at daycare centers , 18 airborne viruses can be delivered over long distances to virus - free spaces during the night . Since the 19 SARS - CoV - 2 virus can survive in aerosols for hours and up to days on surfaces , depending on the 20 environmental conditions [ 52 , 53 ] , the possibility of airborne transmission at unoccupied hours should 21 be carefully considered for safety . This result , therefore , recommends sufficient flush - out before and 22 after occupancy to take precautions against possible long - distance exposure of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus 23 in daycare centers . 24 3 ) In the experiment on air purifier fan modes , the concentration of virus - like particles decreased by 25 about 27 % and 86 % in the weak ( W ) and strong ( S ) modes , respectively , compared to the condition 26 with no air purifier . Even though there is a potential risk of delivering virus - like particles by direct 27 airflow from the air purifier outlet , given the extended stay of teachers and children in the closed space , 28 air purifiers with high - performance filters should be considered as an additional measure . 29 4 ) The climate of the external environment can affect the indoor diffusion characteristics of virus - like 30 particles in daycare centers . In spring , natural ventilation through windows in daycare centers is lowered 31 due to the reduced air temperature difference between indoors and outdoors , and the outside wind speed 32 is also lower than in winter . In the results of the R - daycare center , complementary measures ( e . g . , longer 33 ventilation hours , additional ventilation windows , or mechanical ventilation ) are recommended to 34 ensure better safety from airborne viruses , regardless of seasonal changes . 35 5 ) In the experiments , the transmission paths of airborne viruses were mainly affected by source location 36 ( e . g . , nursing room ) , usage behavior ( e . g . , door and window open / closed ) , and architectural layouts 37 ( e . g . , interior partitions and walls ) . The source locations ( e . g . , Nursing room - 2 ( Age 2 ) , Nursing room - 38 3 ( Age 2 ) , Nursing room ( Age 3 ) ) influenced the transmission direction , time , and concentrations . 39 Hallways were primary paths to transport virus - like particles between nursing rooms . Lastly , restrooms 40 between nursing rooms are vulnerable if an infected person emits virus - containing aerosols into the 41 space while using the restroom . If restroom doors were not closed during the daytime , the restrooms 42 located between nursing rooms could also be used as a path . Therefore , restroom doors between nursing 43 rooms should always be closed during open hours , and personal hygiene after the use of the restroom 44 is recommended . Therefore , the potential transmission paths determined by source location , usage 45 behavior , and architectural layouts should be controlled to reduce the possible airborne transmission in 46 buildings . 47 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 24 7 . Conclusion 1 During the last two years , infectious viruses and variants ( e . g . , Delta and Omicron ) have been a critical 2 threat to everyday life and health . The threats of invisible viruses and evolved infectivity require people 3 to be prepared for every situation in buildings . In addition , although the virus transmission routes in 4 buildings have been identified in many parts , the outbreak location and the scale of infection vary due 5 to different building environments . This study analyzed the possibility of airborne virus transmission 6 based on the evidence of viruses found in the air purifier filter samples in a cluster outbreak case of the 7 R - daycare center and identified mitigation performance of the daycare center . Several experimental 8 scenarios were conducted to understand the behavior of airborne virus - like particles and diagnose the 9 effectiveness of the current mitigation measures . The experiments verified that the results of airborne 10 virus transmission can be used to describe the long - distance transfer in the actual outbreak . Therefore , 11 the findings of this study should be considered to improve the readiness of daycare centers during the 12 pandemic , especially in Korea , because many daycare centers are exposed to similar building 13 environments like R - daycare center . 14 Last but not least , to the best of our knowledge , this study is one of the few studies that has investigated 15 long - distance transmission based on the actual outbreak in the daycare center . However , the 16 characteristics of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus have yet to be perfectly identified and fully described . The 17 behavior and actual infectivity of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus would very vary depending on indoor and 18 outdoor environments ( e . g . , virus source location , discharge rates , patient behavior , and indoor and 19 outdoor climatic conditions ) . Therefore , further studies are necessary to confirm the possibility of 20 airborne SARS - CoV - 2 virus transmission through several case studies . 21 22 Acknowledgment 23 All authors appreciate the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency , local health - related 24 authorities , and the R - daycare center for their cooperation and detailed information . 25 26 Declaration of Competing Interest 27 The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that 28 could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper . 29 30 Funding 31 This research was supported by a fund ( fund code 202105082FD - 00 ) by Research of Korea Centers for 32 Disease Control and Prevention and the ‘National Research Council of Science & Technology ( NST ) ’ 33 - ‘Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology ( KICT ) ’ Postdoctoral Fellowship 34 Program for Young Scientists at KICT in South Korea . 35 36 Reference 37 [ 1 ] Worldometer , COVID - 19 Live Update , ( 2022 ) . https : / / www . worldometers . info / coronavirus / 38 ( accessed January 10 , 2022 ) . 39 [ 2 ] KOSIS , COVID - 19 Status , ( 2021 ) .
