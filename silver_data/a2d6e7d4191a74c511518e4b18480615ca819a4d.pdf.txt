Caveolae Act as Membrane Reserves Which Limit Mechanosensitive I Cl , swell Channel Activation during Swelling in the Rat Ventricular Myocyte Lukasz Kozera , Ed White , Sarah Calaghan * Institute of Membrane and Systems Biology , University of Leeds , Leeds , United Kingdom Abstract Background : Many ion channels are preferentially located in caveolae where compartmentalisation / scaffolding with signal transduction components regulates their activity . Channels that are mechanosensitive may be additionally dependent on caveolar control of the mechanical state of the membrane . Here we test which mechanism underlies caveolar - regulation of the mechanosensitive I Cl , swell channel in the adult cardiac myocyte . Methodology / PrincipalFindings : Rat ventricular myocytes were exposed to solution of 0 . 02 tonicity ( T ; until lysis ) , 0 . 64T for 10 – 15 min ( swelling ) , and / or methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( MBCD ; to disrupt caveolae ) . MBCD and 0 . 64T swelling reduced the number of caveolae visualised by electron microscopy by 75 and 50 % respectively . MBCD stimulated translocation of caveolin 3 from caveolae - enriched buoyant membrane fractions , but both caveolin 1 and 3 remained in buoyant fractions after swelling . I Cl , swell inhibition in control cells decreased time to half - maximal volume ( t 0 . 5 , vol ; 0 . 64T ) , consistent with a role for I Cl , swell in volume regulation . MBCD - treated cells showed reduced time to lysis ( 0 . 02T ) and t 0 . 5 , vol ( 0 . 64T ) compared with controls . The negative inotropic response to swelling ( an index of I Cl , swell activation ) was enhanced by MBCD . Conclusions / Significance : These data show that disrupting caveolae removes essential membrane reserves , which speeds swelling in hyposmotic conditions , and thereby promotes activation of I Cl , swell . They illustrate a general principle whereby caveolae as a membrane reserve limit increases in membrane tension during stretch / swelling thereby restricting mechanosensitive channel activation .

They represent a specialised form of lipid raft , characterised by the presence of the small protein caveolin , which inserts into the inner leaflet of the membrane via a hairpin loop [ 1 ] . The assymetrical insertion of caveolin , and its tendency to cluster into oligomers gives caveolae their typical flask - like shape [ 2 , 3 ] . Caveolin ( Cav ) is expressed as 3 major isoforms : Cav 1 and 2 ( ubiquitously expressed ) and Cav 3 ( muscle - specific ) . Caveolae have been shown to play a role in a variety of cellular processes including endocytosis , cholesterol homeostasis and signal transduction . Caveolae act as a compartment which brings together elements of the endocytotic machinery , lipid transporters and signal cascade components . Within caveolae , Cav acts as a regulator of protein activity and as a scaffold by interaction via its 20 residue scaffolding domain [ 4 , 5 ] . In addition to their ability to compart - mentalise signalling , another property of caveolae , as a reserve of extra membrane [ 6 ] , may be relevant to their functional role . We are interested in the contribution of caveolae to volume regulation during swelling in the cardiac myocyte . In the heart , cell swelling can occur during episodes of ischaemia and reperfusion . During ischaemia , metabolites such as lactate accumulate within the cell causing swelling which is exacerbated on reperfusion , when the hyperosmotic extracellular solution is exchanged for one with normal osmolarity . During swelling , ion channels are activated that regulate cell volume ; the main volume - regulatory channel is the swelling activated chloride channel I Cl , swell [ 7 , 8 ] . During swelling , I Cl , swell is considered to be acting as a mechanosensor responding to changes in membrane tension , rather than to decreased intracellular osmolarity , because it can also be activated in response to other mechanical stimuli [ 9 , 10 ] . The first direct evidence for a link between caveolae and volume regulation was made by Trouet et al . [ 11 ] . These workers showed that Caco - 2 cells , which do not express Cav , generate minimal membrane current in response to hypo - osmotic challenge , yet show a pronounced membrane current characteristic of I Cl , swell following transfection with Cav 1 . This group went on to show that transfection of Cav - expressing endothelial cells with truncated Cav 1 ( D 1 – 81 ) , which displaces endogenous Cav 1 from the lipid raft membrane fractions , impaired activation of I Cl , swell during swelling [ 12 ] . These data suggest that the I Cl , swell channel or elements that regulate I Cl , swell require caveolae / caveolin . Consistent with PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8312 caveolae’s role as a compartment , it has been suggested that they affect volume regulation by bringing together the I Cl , swell channel with tyrosine kinases which regulate channel activity [ 12 , 13 ] . In the cardiac myocyte this might be achieved through the clamping of inhibitory src kinases in an inactive configuration by Cav [ 14 – 17 ] . However , caveolae’s property as a membrane reserve is also likely to be relevant to processes like volume regulation that depend on changes in membrane tension . The lipid bilayer can only increase in area by around 3 % before rupture , so membrane reserves are essential to allow changes in cell volume to occur without irreversible cell damage [ 18 , 19 ] . Sarcolemmal folds at the Z line and caveolae act as sources of available surface membrane in the ventricular myocyte [ 20 , 21 ] . It has been estimated that 22 % of the membrane is in caveolae in the adult rat ventricular myocyte [ 22 ] , and stretch - and swelling - induced incorporation of caveolae into surface membrane has been reported in a preliminary study by Kohl et al . [ 21 ] . As a membrane reserve , caveolae could affect the activation of mechanosensitive channels that regulate cell volume ( like I Cl , swell ) by limiting increases in membrane tension for a given change in cell volume . However , the work of Trouet et al . [ 11 ] is not consistent with a role for caveolae as a membrane reserve which would limit , rather than enhance , I Cl , swell activation . The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of swelling on caveolar morphology and density , and to determine the consequences of removing caveolae for processes that depend on I Cl , swell activation ( volume regulation , contractility ) in the adult ventricular myocyte . Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that caveolae as a membrane reserve attenuate I Cl , swell activation by limiting increases in membrane tension during swelling . Results Figure 1 shows the change in myocyte volume in response to 0 . 64T hypotonic solution . After 9 min in hypotonic solution cell volume had increased by 41 6 2 % with a time to half maximal volume of 3 . 4 6 0 . 3 min ( n = 16 cells ) . Apparent surface area increased by 16 6 1 % during this time . The time - course of changes in cell volume represents the sum of increased volume through osmotic swelling and decreased volume through volume - regulatory mechanisms , principally I Cl , swell . As volume and apparent surface area measurements are estimates based on a 2 - dimensional image of the cell , we consider that it is the time - course of swelling that provides the most sensitive index of processes that modulate volume regulation . Effect of Hyposmotic Challenge on Caveolar Morphology Figure 2 shows representative electron micrographs of areas of cell membrane from myocytes exposed to isotonic and hypotonic solution for 15 min . In cells exposed to isotonic solution , both invaginations and closed subsarcolemmal vesicles are clearly evident with a diameter consistent with that of caveolae ( 50 – 100 nm ) . A proportion of apparently ‘closed’ caveolae could represent an artefact of sectioning within the bulb of the caveolae , but outside the neck ( see Discussion ) . The density of caveolae was less in myocytes exposed to hypotonic solution ( see Figure 2B ) . Figure 2C summarises mean data for the number of caveolae under isotonic and hypotonic conditions . Swelling was associated with a significant reduction ( P , 0 . 05 ) in the total number of caveolae by around 50 % . When the 2 populations of caveolae were considered separately , it was clear that this reduction in caveolae number reflects a reduction in closed caveolae only ; the number of open caveolae was identical under isotonic and hypotonic conditions . Disruption of Caveolae with MBCD We have previously shown that treatment of myocytes with 2 mM MBCD for 1 h at 37 u C depletes caveolae of their 2 essential components , cholesterol and Cav [ 23 ] . Here we show the effect of MBCD on caveolar morphology . Figure 3 shows electron micrographs of areas of cell membrane from control and MBCD - treated myocytes , and mean data for the number of open and closed populations of caveolae . The number of identifiable caveolae was reduced by 75 % following MBCD treatment ( P , 0 . 05 ) which , by contrast to the effect of swelling , was due to a reduction in both open and closed populations ( Figure 3C ) . EM data from control cells ( Fig . 3 ) allow us to estimate the proportion of membrane within the caveolar reserve in our myocytes . In < 100 nm sections we see 0 . 6 caveolae per m m membrane ( equating to 6 per m m 2 ) , which is identical to values reported in adult rat myocardium using transmission EM by Patel et al . [ 24 ] , but lower than that reported by Gabella [ 22 ] ( 11 per m m 2 ) . The average diameter of a caveola is < 75 nm which ( assuming the caveola is a perfect sphere ) means that the caveolar surface membrane area will be < 0 . 02 m m 2 . Therefore , open and closed caveolae together contribute around 12 % to membrane area in these cells . This is lower than a previous estimate of 22 % [ 22 ] , consistent with the difference in measured caveolar density ( 6 vs . 11 per m m 2 ) . Do Swelling - Induced Changes in Caveolar Morphology Cause Translocation of Cav 3 ? Some mechanical stimuli cause translocation of Cav from caveolae which can have implications for signalling regulated by Cav [ 25 ] . Muscle - specific Cav 3 is the predominant isoform in the cardiac myocyte , however Cav 1 has recently been shown to be expressed in these cells [ 26 , 27 ] . Figure 4 shows the distribution of Cav 1 and Cav 3 across membrane fractions under isotonic Figure 1 . Time - course of myocyte swelling in response to 0 . 64T hypotonic solution .

In the cardiac myocyte , both isoforms of Cav are enriched in fractions 5 and 6 of the gradient which represent the buoyant cholesterol - containing lipid raft / caveolar fractions [ 23 ] . We saw no effect of swelling on the distribution of Cav 1 or Cav 3 between fractions ; Cav remained predominantly in the buoyant membrane fractions . These data suggest that , although swelling reduces the number of caveolae , it does not stimulate translocation of Cav . The molecular identity of I Cl , swell is unknown , although several candidates have been proposed including C1C - 3 , P - glycoprotein and phospholemman ( see [ 8 ] ) . Therefore , we were unable to show whether I Cl , swell channels are present in the caveolae / lipid raft membrane fraction and whether swelling stimulates their translocation . Estimation of Surface Membrane and Intracellular Membrane Reserves Next , we measured the effect of disrupting caveolae with MBCD on the maximum increase in volume and surface area , and time to lysis in cells exposed to a solution of very low osmolarity ( 0 . 02T ) in order to estimate the surface and intracellular membrane reserves ( which include open and closed populations of caveolae respectively ) [ 19 ] . These data are summarised in Figure 5 . In control cells , the maximum increase in volume and apparent surface area were 68 6 10 % and 24 6 5 % respectively . There was a tendency for both parameters to be reduced in cells treated with MBCD , although these differences were not significantly different ( P . 0 . 05 ) . However , disruption of caveolae significantly reduced ( P , 0 . 01 ) the time to cell lysis from 14 . 2 6 1 . 1 min in control cells to 10 . 5 6 1 . 3 min in MBCD treated cells . These data are consistent with caveolae acting as membrane reserves which protect the cardiac cell from lysis . Volume Regulation Following Inhibition of I Cl , swell and / or Disruption of Caveolae I Cl , swell contributes to volume regulation in the cardiac myocyte , limiting cell swelling . In order to assess the way that Figure 2 . Hyposmotic swelling reduces the density of caveolae in the closed configuration .

In these experiments , tamoxifen ( Tmf ) was used to block I Cl , swell ; Tmf is considered a relatively selective blocker of I Cl , swell and at 10 m M fully blocks this current [ 28 ] . The time - course of swelling in control cells is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 6 summarises values of maximum volume achieved during swelling and the time to half - maximal volume for control cells , cells in which I Cl , swell was inhibited with tamoxifen , MBCD - treated cells , and MBCD treated cells in which I Cl , swell was inhibited with tamoxifen . There was a trend for the maximal volume achieved during swelling to be higher following tamoxifen and / or MBCD treatment although this was not significant ( P . 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . However both tamoxifen and MBCD significantly reduced the time to half - maximal swelling consistent with an increased rate of swelling ( Fig . 6B ) . Tamoxifen treatment of cells in which caveolae were disrupted had no significant effect ( P . 0 . 05 ) on time to half - maximal swelling . Thus inhibition of I Cl , swell and disruption of caveolae have identical ( non - addditive ) effects ; both attenuate volume regulation in the cardiac cell . Effect of Caveolar Disruption on Shortening Response to Swelling I Cl , swell depolarises resting membrane potential and decreases action potential duration [ 7 ] . We have previously shown that 10 min exposure to hypotonic solution abbreviates the action potential duration in the rat ventricular myocyte , an effect sensitive to 4 , 4 9 diisothiocyanostilbene - 2 , 2 9 - disulphonic acid ( DIDS ) , confirming a contribution from I Cl , swell [ 29 ] . The negative inotropic response observed after swelling has been ascribed in part to this I Cl , swell - induced action potential abbreviation [ 29 , 30 ] . We used the swelling - induced change in contractility as an index of I Cl , swell to test how disrupting caveolae affects I Cl , swell activation . As Tmf also blocks L type Ca 2 + current [ 31 ] , and because we observed a 70 % reduction in contractility with 10 m M Tmf ( data not shown ) , we used DIDS to inhibit I Cl , swell in experiments involving measurement of cell contractility . In isotonic conditions , DIDS ( 50 m M ) has no effect on action potential configuration [ 29 ] or basal cell contractility ( present study ; data not shown ) , confirming that it has no significant effect on currents flowing during the normal action potential in the absence of swelling . Figure 7 shows the effect of inhibiting I Cl , swell and disrupting Figure 3 . The cholesterol - depleting agent methyl b cyclodextrin ( MBCD ) reduces the density of open and closed caveolae .

I Cl , swell inhibition with DIDS reversed the negative inotropic response to swelling , consistent with a role for I Cl , swell in this . Although MBCD mimicked the effect of I Cl , swell inhibition on the volume response to swelling ( Fig . 6 ) , in cells in which caveolae were disrupted with MBCD we saw a significant potentiation ( P , 0 . 05 ) of the negative inotropic response to swelling at 6 and 10 min after exposure to hypotonic solution relative to controls . This suggests that disrupting caveolae increases activation of I Cl , swell . Discussion In this study we have looked at the effect of hyposmotic swelling on the morphology and Cav content of caveolae , and the impact of caveolar disruption on processes that depend on I Cl , swell activation in the cardiac myocyte . We have shown that swelling has marked effects on the configuration of caveolae without affecting Cav localisation . Disrupting caveolae has significant effects on volume regulation and contractility in response to swelling , two processes which involve I Cl , swell activation . Our data are consistent with the idea that disrupting caveolae removes essential membrane reserves so that cells swell more quickly , thereby potentiating activation of the mechanosensitive I Cl , swell channel . A simple model summarising our findings is shown in Figure 8 . Using electron microscopy we have quantified for the first time the effect of hyposmotic swelling on the morphology and number of caveolae in the isolated cardiac myocyte . We see a 50 % reduction in the number of caveolae ( identified on the basis of size and shape ) after 15 min exposure to hypotonic solution . This change in caveolae number reflects a decrease in the number of closed caveolae for which we cannot visualise a neck which connects with the sarcolemma . No change in the number of open caveolae was recorded . In agreement , Kohl et al . [ 21 ] have reported an absence of closed caveolae in rabbit myocardium after 30 min swelling with 0 . 75T solution . In past decades there has been discussion as to whether closed subplasmalemmal vesicles of a size consistent with caveolae are truly closed caveolae , or whether they in fact represent a population of caveolae sectioned outside the connecting neck region . Early EM studies showed that in smooth , skeletal and cardiac muscle extracellular markers penetrate virtually all subplasmalemmal vesicles of a size consistent with caveolae , suggesting that they are relatively static structures open to the extracellular space [ 32 , 33 ] . However , Gabella [ 22 ] reported nearly twice as many caveolae with transmission EM than with freeze fracture EM ( which recognises only caveolae with connecting necks ) , suggesting that around half of caveolae are in the closed configuration . Moreover , increases in the number and diameter of connecting necks visible in freeze - fracture EM in response to increases in osmolarity have been reported in the atria [ 34 ] , consistent with the idea that caveolar necks may be reversibly inserted into , and withdrawn from , the sarcolemma in response to changes in osmolarity . In the present study , on the basis of the neck : bulb diameter recorded in open caveolae ( around 1 : 2 ) , a significant proportion of caveolae recorded in the closed state in control cells ( 85 % of the total ) should represent true closed vesicles . This is in accord with our observation that these closed caveolae are more distant from the sarcolemma than their open counterparts ( see Fig . 2A ) . We propose that the effect of swelling on reducing closed caveolae without affecting the open configuration underlies a cycle whereby stretch causes flattening of open caveolae in tandem with sarcolemmal incorporation of closed caveolae ( see Figure 8 ) . Kohl and co - workers [ 21 ] have previously reported evidence of stretch - incorporation of closed caveolae in the adult myocardium . The idea of increased membrane tension acting as a feedback mechanism for vesicle recruitment is well established [ 18 , 35 , 36 ] . Despite effects of swelling on the morphology of caveolae , we saw no translocation of Cav 1 or 3 from the caveolar fraction of the myocytes ( see Figure 8 ) . Whilst some have reported stretch - Figure 4 . Hyposmotic swelling does not cause translocation of Cav 1 or Cav 3 from caveolar membrane fractions . Ventricular myocytes were exposed to isotonic or hypotonic solutions for 15 min , then subject to Na 2 CO 3 extraction and discontinuous sucrose density gradient fractionation . A .

For example , although the small G proteins Rac and RhoA translocate from caveolae in axially stretch neonatal cardiac myocytes , Cav 3 was shown to remain in caveolae [ 37 ] . In the ventricular myocyte , the maximum volume and surface area increase recorded prior to lysis ( 68 and 24 % ) are much less than that reported for epithelial cells or fibroblasts ( . 1000 and 360 % ) [ 19 ] , suggesting that the ventricular myocyte has less membrane reserves than these cell types . Groulx et al . [ 19 ] recently addressed the source of membrane reserves during modest and extreme swelling in cultured cell lines by measuring surface area and volume changes with or without functional exocytotic pathways . Their data suggest that , in epithelial cells and fibrobasts , Figure 5 . Effect of caveolar disruption on maximum cell volume , surface area and time to lysis in 5 mOsM solution . Quiescent ventricular myocytes were exposed to a 0 . 02T hypotonic solution and the maximum cell volume and surface area achieved before lysis was estimated from a video image of the cell .

Inhibition of I Cl , swell with 10 m M tamoxifen ( Tmf ) and / or disruption of caveolae with MBCD had no significant effect on the maximum volume achieved during swelling . By contrast , Tmf and MBCD both significantly reduced the time to half - maximal swelling , although the effects were not additive ( * * P , 0 . 01 vs . control group ( Con ) ; ANOVA ; n = 16 – 19 cells ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0008312 . g006 Caveolae as Membrane Reserves PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 6 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8312 the majority of membrane reserves required during modest swelling ( , 100 % increase in cell volume ) come from excess surface membrane rather than intracellular membrane stores ( vesicles ) . In the present study , electron microscopy data suggest that , during exposure of the ventricular myocyte to 0 . 64T hypotonic solution ( which gives a 40 % increase in cell volume ) , membrane reserves come from both suface sarcolemma ( open caveolae ) and intracellular membrane ( closed caveolae ) . We estimate that , in our myocytes , the extra surface area available from both open and closed caveolae is around 12 % . This is less than the calculated increase in surface area during modest swelling ( 16 % ) and prior to lysis ( 24 % ) , suggesting that other membrane reserves ( e . g . Z - line folds , see [ 21 ] ) , are involved ) . I Cl , swell contributes to volume regulation in the cardiac myocyte . Here we have confirmed this by showing that the rate of swelling ( indexed by time to half - maximal volume ) in response to 0 . 64T solution is increased when I Cl , swell is inhibited with tamoxifen . Disrupting caveolae with MBCD had an identical effect on the rate of swelling . We know that MBCD causes a translocation of Cav 3 from caveolae and a reduction in the number of identifiable caveolae [ 23 , 24 ] . Therefore one interpretation of these data is that disrupting caveolae inhibits I Cl , swell , in other words , I Cl , swell activation relies on caveolae ( or the presence of Cav 3 ) . This is in accord with work from Trouet et al . [ 11 , 12 ] which suggests that caveolae act as a compartment to bring together the I Cl , swell channel with elements necessary for its activation . If I Cl , swell activation relies on caveolae / Cav 3 , then the negative inotropic response observed several minutes after swelling , which has been ascribed to action potential abbreviation secondary to I Cl , swell activation [ 29 ] , should be attenuated when caveolae are disrupted with MBCD . In contrast to this prediction , we saw that the negative inotropic response after 6 and 10 min of swelling was enhanced in cells treated with MBCD . These data are not consistent with the hypothesis that I Cl , swell relies on caveolae / Cav 3 , but suggest instead that disrupting caveolae promotes activation of I Cl , swell by reducing the membrane reserves of the cardiac myocyte .

A simple model summarising the effect of cholesterol depletion and / or swelling on caveolae configuration , Cav 3 distribution , membrane tension and consequences for I Cl , swell activation . A . Under control conditions , caveolae exist in open and closed configurations , Cav 3 is found predominantly in buoyant caveolae - containing membrane fractions ( BF ; fractions 5 , 6 of the sucrose gradient , see Fig . 4 ) , and the I Cl , swell channel is inactive . B . MBCD reduces the number of open and closed caveolae in association with translocation of Cav 3 from the BF to non - buoyant fractions ( nBF ; fractions 7 – 12 ) , which contain heavy membranes and cytosolic proteins . The I Cl , swell channel remains inactive . C . By contrast , swelling reduces the number of caveolae in the closed configuration only . We propose that this is through flattening of open caveolae in tandem with sarcolemmal incorporation of closed caveolae . No Cav 3 translocation from BF to nBF is seen during swelling . Membrane tension increases with swelling and this activates I Cl , swell which abbreviates the action potential . D . In MBCD - treated cells , lack of available membrane reserves ( open and closed caveolae ) means that swelling increases membrane tension more than in control cells , causing enhanced I Cl , swell activation , action potential shortening and negative inotropy . Cav 3 - containing cholesterol - enriched membranes are shown in red : open caveolae ( sarcolemmal red crescents ) ; closed caveloae ( intracellular red circles ) ; flattened caveolae ( sarcolemmal red lines ) . A representation of relative Cav 3 band density in BF and nBF , an index of membrane tension , and a representative action potential under each condition is shown to the right . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0008312 . g008 Caveolae as Membrane Reserves PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8312 In this study we have shown , using EM and cell lysis , that disrupting caveolae removes essential membrane reserves . This means that cells in which caveolae are disrupted swell more quickly during exposure to 0 . 64T hypotonic solution . This effect can be mimicked by inhibiting I Cl , swell which normally limits swelling during hyposmotic challenge . Because I Cl , swell is activated more readily when there are less caveolae , we see a potentiation of the shortening response to swelling which reflects I Cl , swell - induced action potential abbreviation ( see Fig . 8 ) . Therefore , the present study presents a different mechanism for the role of caveolae in I Cl , swell activation to that proposed by others in Cav 1 - expressing cultured cells [ 11 , 12 ] . We show that it is caveolae’s role as a membrane reserve that is important in cell volume regulation in the adult cardiac myocyte . The use of MBCD as an approach to selectively disrupt caveolae can have limitations because it also targets non - caveolar rafts ( which are dependent on cholesterol ) . Further - more , because MBCD affects both caveolar structure and Cav content ( Fig . 3 ; [ 23 ] ) , MBCD does not distinguish between caveolae - dependent and Cav - dependent processes . However , the strength of the present study is that data cannot be explained by an effect of non - caveolar rafts or Cav on I Cl , swell activity . If non - caveolar rafts or Cav keep I Cl , swell inactive , then MBCD - treated cells would swell more slowly , which is opposite to the effect that we saw ( Fig . 6 ) . If non - caveolar rafts or Cav promote I Cl , swell activation , then MBCD treated cells would swell more quickly ( as we report ) but the negative inotropic effect of swelling ( which is proportional to I Cl , swell activation ) would be less ( whereas we show that it is more ; Fig . 7 ) . So our data clearly show that it is the role of caveolae as a membrane reserve that predominates over all others in regulation of I Cl , swell in the adult cardiac myocyte . We do not discount the possibility that the major role of caveolae as a membrane reserve may obscure more minor effects of non - caveolar rafts or Cav on I Cl , swell in these cells . This work is the first to show evidence for a role of caveolae in I Cl , swell activation in the cardiac cell , and highlights a general mechanism by which caveolae could modulate mechanosensitive channel activation . Materials and Methods Ethics Statement All animal experimentation was carried out in accordance with the Animals ( Scientific Procedures ) Act 1986 and conforms to the Recommendation from the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals . Animals were humanely killed by schedule 1 methods . Myocyte Isolation Myocytes were isolated enzymatically from the hearts of male Wistar rats ( 250 – 280 g ) according to the method described by Calaghan et al . [ 38 ] . Myocytes were treated with the cholesterol - depleting agent methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( MBCD , 2 mM ) for 37 u C for 1 h to disrupt caveolae . Electron Microscopy After treatment with isotonic or hypotonic solution for 15 min , a pellet of cells was formed by rapid centrifugation of the cell suspension at 80 g . Cell pellets were fixed overnight in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in isotonic or hypotonic solution as appropriate , post - fixed with 1 % osmium tetroxide in 100 mM cocadylate buffer and dehydrated through an ethanol series . Cells were embedded in araldite and ultra thin sections ( , 100 nm ) were stained with 20 % uranyl acetate ( 30 min ) and Reynolds lead citrate ( 30 min ) in the presence of 1 M NaOH . Sections were observed using a JEOL 1200 transmission electron microscope . Caveolae were defined as flask - shaped invaginations ( ‘open’ caveolae ) or subsarcolemmal vesicles ( ‘closed’ caveolae ) with a size between < 50 and 100 nm in diameter . Sucrose Density Fractionation Preparations were fractionated using detergent - free methods as we have described previously [ 23 ] . Peripheral membrane proteins were extracted in 500 mM Na 2 CO 3 ( pH 11 . 0 ) containing 0 . 5 mM EDTA and 1 % protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) . Samples were homogenised ( Ultra - Turrax T8 ; Ika ) , then sonicated ( Vibra Cell ; Sonics ) 3 times each for 20 s at full power . Approximately 2 ml of homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of 90 % sucrose in MES - buffered saline ( 25 mM MES , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , pH 6 . 5 ) to form a 45 % sucrose solution . A discontinuous sucrose gradient was created by layering on to this a further 4 ml each of 35 % and 5 % sucrose solution ( MES - buffered saline with 250 mM Na 2 CO 3 ) . Gradients were centrifuged for 17 h at 280 , 000 g ( Beckman SW40Ti rotor ) at 4 u C . A total of 12 fractions ( each 1 ml ) were collected following fractionation . Cav 1 and Cav 3 were measured by Western blotting ( antibodies 610406 and 610420 respectively ; BD Biosciences ) following SDS - PAGE [ 38 ] . Equal volumes of fractions were loaded onto the gel and the band density normalised to the sum of the band density in all fractions . Measurement of Cell Volume and Contraction Isolated myocytes were placed in an experimental chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope and continually perfused with a HEPES - based solution ( isotonic or hypotonic , see Solutions ) at 22 – 24 u C . For measurement of cell volume , cells were quiescent ; for assessment of shortening they were field - stimulated at 0 . 5 Hz and cell length was monitored using an edge - detection system ( Crescent Electronics ) . Cell volume was calculated from a video image of the cell using the relationship V = ( P wdL ) / 4 ( where V is volume , w is width , d is depth and L is length , assuming the cell is an elliptical cylinder with the ratio of width to depth of 3 : 1 ) [ 39 ] . Apparent surface area ( which does not take into account any indendation / folds in the surface membrane ) was estimated from SA = 2 P L ( ! ( ( w / 2 ) 2 + ( w / 6 ) 2 ) . Solutions Isotonic physiological HEPES - based solution ( Iso ) contained ( mM ) : NaCl , 57 ; HEPES , 5 ; Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 ; MgSO 4 7H 2 O 1 , KCl , 5 ; sucrose , 113 ; glucose , 5 . 5 ; CaCl 2 , 1 , pH 7 . 4 ( 280 6 10 mosM ) . Hypotonic solution ( Hypo ) had the same composition and pH as the isotonic standard physiological solution except that 113 mM of sucrose was omitted ( 180 6 10 mOsM ; 0 . 64T ) . Cells were exposed to hypotonic solution for 10 – 15 min . For lysis experiments , hypotonic solution contained ( mM ) : CaCl 2 , 1 ; MgCl 2 , 1 . The pH was adjusted to 7 . 4 ( 5 6 2 mOsM ; 0 . 02T ) . For experiments to determine the effect of MBCD on caveolar morphology ( Fig . 3 ) , control physiological HEPES - based solution ( Con ) had the same composition as Iso but sucrose was omitted and [ NaCl ] was 137 mM .
