Spudich , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , March 1 , 1999 ( received for review January 12 , 1999 ) ABSTRACT Actin polymerization is required for the gen - eration of motile force at the leading edge of both lamellipodia and filopodia and also at the surface of motile intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes . Local catalysis of actin filament polymerization is accomplished in L . monocytogenes by the bacterial protein ActA . Polystyrene beads coated with purified ActA protein can undergo direc - tional movement in an actin - rich cytoplasmic extract . Thus , the actin polymerization - based motility generated by ActA can be used to move nonbiological cargo , as has been demon - strated for classical motor molecules such as kinesin and myosin . Initiation of unidirectional movement of a symmet - rically coated particle is a function of bead size and surface protein density . Small beads ( < 0 . 5 m m in diameter ) initiate actin - based motility when local asymmetries are built up by random fluctuations of actin filament density or by thermal motion , demonstrating the inherent ability of the dynamic actin cytoskeleton to spontaneously self - organize into a polar structure capable of generating unidirectional force . Larger beads ( up to 2 m m in diameter ) can initiate movement only if surface asymmetry is introduced by coating the beads on one hemisphere . This explains why the relatively large L . mono - cytogenes requires polar distribution of ActA on its surface to move . Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram - positive intracellular bacte - rial pathogen that moves rapidly through host cells or cyto - plasmic extracts , propelled by actin hijacked from the host cell ( 1 – 3 ) . Moving bacteria are associated with an actin - rich struc - ture that resembles the tail of a comet ( 4 ) . The actin filaments within the comet tail remain fixed in space as the bacterium moves , and the rate of bacterial movement is tightly correlated with the rate of actin filament polymerization at the front of the comet tail ( 5 , 6 ) . Because no motor proteins have been found to be involved in this form of motility , filament elon - gation is thought to provide the force necessary to propel the bacterium through the cytoplasm ( 7 ) . The comet tail structure is functionally similar to the actin meshwork in the lamellipodia of a locomoting eukaryotic cell , and the surface of the bacterium is analogous to the leading edge . Therefore , insights into the mechanism of actin - based bacterial movement should help explain the mechanisms of eukaryotic actin - based motil - ity . A bacterial comet tail is made up of short ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 m m ) actin filaments crosslinked together to form a dense cylindrical structure ( 4 ) . Other intracytoplasmic pathogens form similar comet tail structures and undergo actin - based motility , includ - ing the unrelated bacteria Shigella flexneri ( 8 ) and Rickettsia spp . ( 9 ) and vaccina virus ( 10 ) . In uninfected cells and cytoplasmic extracts , actin - rich comet tails are associated with moving endosomes ( J . Heuser , personal communication ) and phospholipid vesicles ( 11 ) . Although much is understood about the biochemical mechanisms of catalyzing actin filament polymerization in several of these systems ( 12 – 14 ) , relatively little is known about how this local surface catalysis results in comet tail formation , force generation , and motility . It is striking that a variety of biochemical mechanisms for cata - lyzing local actin polymerization on the surface of a small object ( bacterium , virus , or membrane vesicle ) all result in the same type of actin self - organization and movement . A single L . monocytogenes gene product , ActA , has been identified as being important for actin - based motility . ActA is distributed on the bacterial surface in a polar fashion , and the pole with the higher ActA density is associated with the comet tail ( 15 ) . Mutant strains deficient in expression of this protein cannot associate with actin or move intracellularly ( 16 – 18 ) . Expression of ActA in the nonpathogenic Listeria innocua ( 19 ) or asymmetric attachment of purified protein to the cell wall of Streptococcus pneumoniae ( 20 ) confers actin - based motility on those heterologous organisms . To shed light on the role of asymmetry of ActA distribution and the mechanism by which local actin polymerization translates into force generation , we have created a simplified system in which parameters govern - ing movement initiation can be varied easily . MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Purification and Bead Coating . ActA - His was pu - rified from strain DP - L2723 of L . monocytogenes ( a gift from Daniel Portnoy , University of California , Berkeley ) expressing a truncated actA gene encoding amino acids 1 – 613 described in ref . 14 . A flask containing 50 ml of brain heart infusion media with 10 m g y ml chloramphenicol was inoculated with one colony of DP - L2723 and was grown overnight ( 8 hr ) at 37°C . The bacterial culture was divided between 2 3 1 liter of modified D10 minimal media ( originally reported in ref . 21 with amino acid supplements of 1 . 55 mM L - glutamine , 1 . 74 mM L - asparagine , 1 . 94 mM L - cysteine , and 1 . 77 mM L - leucine , 150 m M EDTA in lieu of nitrilotriacetic acid , 180 m M FeN 3 O 9 z 9H 2 O for the iron source , and glucose added to 0 . 4 % ) with 20 m g y ml chloramphenicol and was grown for 12 – 18 hr at 37°C in the dark . After bacteria were pelleted , 2 g of DE52 resin ( Whatman ) was added to supernatant containing se - creted protein and was incubated for 1 hr with agitation . All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C . The resin was collected by centrifugation and was washed free of D10 media with 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 9 ) and 100 mM NaCl . ActA was eluted in batch from the DE52 resin with 15 ml of 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 9 ) and 500 mM NaCl . Eluate was diluted to 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 9 ) and 250 mM NaCl ( buffer A ) and was loaded onto a 5 - ml nickel nitrilotriacetic acid agarose ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

The column was washed with buffer A and was developed with a linear gradient of buffer B ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 9 y 500 mM NaCl y 1 M Imidazole ) . ActA - His came off the column at 250 mM Imidazole . Protein was further purified on a HiTrap Q ( Amersham Pharmacia ) column by using a gradient of NaCl from 20 mM to 1 M in 20 mM Bis - Tris ( pH 6 . 5 ) . ActA - His eluted at 250 mM NaCl and was stored at 2 80°C . Carboxylated polystyrene beads ( Polysciences ) , ranging in size from 0 . 2 m m to 0 . 9 m m , were incubated in protein solution containing the stated percentage of ActA - His and supple - mented with ovalbumin to 2 mg y ml final protein concentra - tion . In all cases , conditions were such that the amount of protein was saturating . For example , 2 m l of 0 . 5 - m m beads ( 2 . 5 % solids ) were added to 10 m l of protein solution ; volume was adjusted to account for changes in surface area when beads of different sizes were used . Beads were incubated in protein solution for 1 hr at room temperature and then were pelleted and washed in XB ( 100 mM KCl y 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 y 2 mM MgCl 2 y 5 mM EGTA y 10 mM K z Hepes , pH 7 . 7 ) and were resuspended in 30 m l of XB . Protein - coated beads were stored on ice or at 4°C and were used for up to 1 week . Asymmetric Beads . To introduce asymmetry on beads , 5 m l of beads ( 0 . 025 % latex solids in ethanol ) were dried onto 22 - mm - square coverslips . The coated coverslips were placed into a vacuum evaporator and were shadowed at an angle of 3 – 4° by using silicon monoxide in a tungsten basket at 10 2 5 torr ( 1 torr 5 133 Pa ) . To confirm asymmetry , the shadowed beads , on coverslips , were treated with 10 % aminopropyltriethoxysi - lane in dimethylformamide for 30 minutes ( to reduce the background staining visible on the bare glass in the shadow of the bead ) , were rinsed in water , and were incubated in 0 . 08 mg y ml rhodamine - BSA . For labeling with ActA - His , beads were removed from the coverslip by using a microspatula and were treated as described for the symmetric beads . Micro - graphs were taken as described below . Motility Assays . For visualizing bead motility , ActA - His - coated beads ( 0 . 5 m l ) were added to Xenopus laevis egg cytoplasmic extract ( 7 m l ) ( prepared as described in ref . 2 ) supplemented with tetramethylrhodamine iodoacetamide - labeled actin ( 1 . 5 m l of 4 . 5 mg y ml rhodamine - actin in 50 m l ) ( prepared as described ref . 22 ) and ATP regenerating mix ( 23 ) . The assay mix was allowed to incubate on ice for 1 hr . Then , a 1 . 2 - m l sample was removed and was squashed between a microscope slide and 22 - mm - square glass coverslip , was sealed with vaseline : lanolin : paraffin ( at 1 : 1 : 1 ) , and was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr in the dark before observing on the microscope . All observations were performed on a Nikon Diaphot - 300 inverted microscope equipped with phase con - trast and epifluorescence optics . Time - lapse video microscopy was achieved with an intensified charge - coupled device cam - era [ Dage – MTI ( Michigan City , IN ) GenIISys y CCD - c72 ] by using METAMORPH ( Universal Imaging , Media , PA ) software . Phase contrast y fluorescence image pairs were recorded every 10 sec , with eight video frames averaged per image . Rates of movement were determined by averaging the distance moved in 100 sec in 10 adjacent time intervals . For the measurement of fraction of beads with tails and intensity of bead fluores - cence , single phase contrast y fluorescent image pairs of several fields were captured for quantification . RESULTS Carboxylated polystyrene beads were coated with a purified form of ActA in which the transmembrane domain has been replaced by 6 3 His ( ActA - His ) . Surprisingly , when added to Xenopus egg extracts containing rhodamine - actin , ActA - His - coated beads with a diameter of 0 . 5 m m moved at rates comparable to L . monocytogenes , seemingly without the need for asymmetric protein distribution . Initially , beads formed symmetric , brightly fluorescent actin clouds . Within 1 hr , a subset of the beads began to move , generating comet tails similar in shape and dynamic behavior to those seen in L . monocytogenes motility ( Fig . 1 ) . This result demonstrates that comet tail formation and actin - based motility require neither bacterial factors other than ActA nor , apparently , asymmetric surface distribution of ActA . This in vitro assay permits us to vary parameters that cannot be easily manipulated in living bacteria , including protein surface density and particle size . By varying these parameters , we can begin to understand how asymmetric movement is initiated by a symmetrically coated bead . The number of motile beads associated with tails strongly depended on the density of ActA - His on the surface ( Fig . 2 a ) and was highest at a surface density of 37 . 5 % ActA - His . Protein surface density of ActA was varied by mixing ActA - His with ovalbumin at various ratios because ovalbumin and ActA - His adsorbed about equally well to the carboxylated latex particles ( data not shown ) . Even though surface protein density affected the fraction of beads with tails , the velocity of a bead once it started moving was independent of ActA - His density ( Fig . 2 b ) . Over an ActA - His surface density range of 25 – 100 % , 0 . 5 - m m beads moved at a rate of 0 . 119 6 0 . 023 m m y sec ( n 5 56 ) , similar to the velocity of L . monocytogenes in the same cytoplasmic extract ( 0 . 126 6 0 . 035 m m y sec , n 5 23 ) . Stationary beads exhibited a wide range of cloud densities , at every protein concentration . Overall , beads with higher surface densities of ActA - His tended to form clouds with a greater actin content , but this dependence was not linear with ActA - His surface density ( Fig . 2 c ) . This observation indicates that assembly of actin clouds is a complex , cooperative process that is not simply determined by the local concentration of ActA - His . Samples coated with the lowest densities of ActA - His showed the greatest variability in actin cloud density , with some very brightly fluorescent clouds and some that were not discernable above background ( note SD in Fig . 2 c ) . Beads coated with the highest densities of ActA - His exhibited more F IG . 1 . Actin - based movement of a 0 . 5 - m m - diameter carboxylated polystyrene microsphere uniformly coated with ActA - His . ActA - His - coated microspheres were incubated in Xenopus egg cytoplasmic extract supplemented with 0 . 15 mg y ml rhodamine - actin . Four frames from a video sequence are shown , each separated by 30 sec . A stationary bead surrounded by an actin cloud is at the lower right .

( Right column ) Bead positions ( red dots ) superimposed on fluorescence images . This bead is moving at a rate of 0 . 153 m m y sec . ( Bar 5 5 m m . ) Biophysics : Cameron et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 96 ( 1999 ) 4909 uniformly bright clouds . Because these beads also were less likely to move than those coated with an intermediate amount of ActA - His , we conclude that dense , uniform actin filament accumulation inhibits the initiation of movement . The likelihood of movement also depends on the size of the bead . ActA - coated beads 0 . 5 m m in diameter or smaller ( 0 . 2 and 0 . 35 m m ) generated comet tails ; however , 0 . 7 - or 0 . 9 - m m beads did not ( Fig . 2 d ) . After 1 hr of incubation at room temperature , . 80 % of 0 . 2 - m m beads had tails , but this per - centage fell off sharply with increasing size , to 12 % at 0 . 5 m m . This very strong size - dependence suggests that random ther - mal motions of the beads may be involved in the initiation of movement . Interestingly , the rate of movement decreased with size ; 0 . 35 - m m beads had an average velocity of 0 . 0609 6 0 . 0130 m m y sec ( n 5 38 ) , and 0 . 2 - m m beads moved at 0 . 0497 6 0 . 0129 m m y sec ( n 5 46 ) . Two models may explain the transition of a uniform cloud to a polar structure : random bead movement as a result of thermal motion or local variations in filament density and in cross - linking of actin filaments in the cloud surrounding the bead . The strong size - dependence we have observed is more consistent with the former mechanism , but our observation that actin cloud assembly is highly cooperative and nonlinear lends credence to the latter . To separate the relative contri - butions of these two sources of asymmetry , we tracked move - ments of 0 . 5 - m m - diameter beads within actin clouds immedi - ately before comet tail formation ( Fig . 3 a ) . Small random movements reminiscent of thermal motion were apparent , but rapid , directed movement occurred only after a buildup of asymmetric actin density in the cloud ( Fig . 3 b – f ) . This individual bead made multiple escape attempts in different directions sequentially . A failed escape attempt was followed by a recovery of cloud symmetry , followed by a new focal actin accumulation at another , seemingly random , location within the cloud . When the bead escaped from the cloud , it was immediately moving at its maximum velocity , which is ex - pected for an object with negligible inertia . We suspect that slow accumulations of asymmetric dense actin foci are medi - ated by actin crosslinking proteins , which are required for comet tail formation ( 24 ) . Fig . 3 shows a representative experiment . Movement initiation was recorded for 12 beads in which a total of 35 velocity spikes on the order of 0 . 1 m m y sec were observed . All of the velocity spikes correlated with a large asymmetry value from 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 . Because a single bead can move sequentially in different directions ( Fig . 3 a ) , and because a single cloud can gain and lose asymmetry over time ( Fig . 3 e ) and may have two or more local zones of high actin density simultaneously ( Fig . 3 d , note , particularly , 1 , 100 – 1 , 200 sec ) , we conclude that the actin density variations we observed are due to stochastic variation in actin filament polymerization and crosslinking dynamics rather than by microheterogeneity in distribution of ActA - His on the bead surface , which would be temporally invariant . Our observations indicate that random local fluctuations in fila - ment density and crosslinking are self - reinforced and can lead to symmetrically coated beads being forced out of the cloud , F IG . 2 . Motility depends on ActA - His surface density and particle size . ( a ) For 0 . 5 - m m - diameter polystyrene beads , the probability of comet tail formation strongly depended on ActA - His surface density . Initiation of movement was most efficient when ’ 37 . 5 % of available sites were occupied by ActA - His ; higher and lower densities inhibited tail formation . Error bars are 6 SD . Between 380 and 630 beads were scored at each surface density . ( b ) For moving 0 . 5 - m m - diameter polystyrene beads , average velocity was independent of ActA - His surface density . Error bars are 6 SD ; n 5 8 – 16 beads for each point . Differences between points are not statistically significant by Student’s t test . Average velocity of L . monocytogenes in this extract was 0 . 126 6 0 . 035 m m y sec ; n 5 23 . ( c ) For nonmoving 0 . 5 - m m - diameter polysty - rene beads , the intensity and variability of the actin clouds depended on ActA - His surface density . Error bars are 6 SD ; n 5 57 – 125 for each concentration . Note that SD is large for low ActA surface densities and decreases substantially at higher densities . ( d ) At optimal ActA - His surface density ( 37 . 5 % of available sites ) , the probability of comet tail formation strongly depended on bead diameter . Beads with diameters of 0 . 7 m m or greater were never observed to form tails whereas most beads of 0 . 2 - m m - diameter formed tails . Error bars are 6 SD ; n 5 100 – 600 per point . All results ( a – d ) were taken at a 1 - hr time - point of incubation at room temperature . 4910 Biophysics : Cameron et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 96 ( 1999 ) initiating comet tail formation . Breaking of symmetry is easier for smaller beads , which undergo more thermal motion ( Fig . 2 d ) , and is more difficult for beads with higher concentrations of ActA - His , where variability in filament density is reduced ( Fig . 2 a and c ) . We have demonstrated that symmetric beads are able to initiate movement , so why is asymmetric attachment of ActA to the cell surface required for bacterial movement ? In our in vitro system , symmetric beads . 0 . 5 m m in diameter did not form tails . The cylindrical L . monocytogenes are ’ 0 . 7 m m in diameter and 2 m m long , substantially larger than the threshold for spontaneous asymmetry . To test the hypothesis that sur - face asymmetry can allow movement initiation for larger beads , we coated carboxylated polystyrene microspheres on one hemisphere by using low - angle shadowing . Protein ad - sorbed preferentially to the uncoated polystyrene surface ( Fig . 4 a and b ) . This artificial asymmetry had three effects on ActA - His - induced bead movement . First , it increased the likelihood that 0 . 5 - m m beads would form comet tails and move , from 12 % if symmetrically coated to 50 % if asymmetri - cally coated . Second , asymmetry conferred motility on beads that were too large to move when symmetrically coated with ActA - His . Shadowed beads with a diameter of 1 m m moved at rates of ’ 0 . 10 m m y sec ( Fig . 4 c ) , similar to the velocity of L . monocytogenes or symmetrically coated smaller beads , and even 2 - m m beads moved , although less frequently and at slower rates ( Fig . 4 d ) . Third , asymmetric beads moved when the ActA - His surface density was as low as 5 % , less than half that of the 12 . 5 % required for symmetrically coated particles . DISCUSSION We have shown that ActA - coated polystyrene beads will form actin - rich comet tails and move in cytoplasmic extract without any other components of the bacterial cell surface . This demonstrates that an actin polymerization - dependent motor can move artificial cargo , as has been shown for classical F IG . 3 . Asymmetry builds up in the actin cloud before bead takeoff . ( a ) Video sequence of a 0 . 5 - m m - diameter ActA - His - coated bead during the transition from cloud to tail . Rhodamine - actin fluorescence is depicted in gray - scale . The position of the polystyrene bead , as determined from paired phase - contrast images , is indicated by the red dots . Actin filament density in the cloud becomes strikingly asymmetric , and the particle bounces around within the confines of the cloud , before escaping and moving rapidly away ’ 1 , 480 sec into the video sequence . Total time elapsed in seconds is shown at the bottom right corner of each frame . Note time compression for the four frames in the bottom row . The contrast in these last four frames has been digitally enhanced relative to the first eight , so that the dimmer comet tail can be seen as well as the bright cloud . ( Bar 5 5 m m . ) ( b ) Angular variation of actin density within the cloud for one frame from the video sequence shown in a ( at 300 sec ) . Fluorescence intensity within a circle of 1 - m m radius centered on the bead varies as a function of radial angle u . ( c ) Actin filament density distribution as a function of angle for the video frame shown in b . For each value of the angle u , the fluorescence intensity is integrated over a wedge - shaped segment between u 2 p y 36 and u 1 p y 36 within a radius of 1 m m around the bead . Color bar shows translation of integrated fluorescence intensity into a color scale , used in d . ( d ) Actin filament density distribution around this bead as a function of time . The arrows indicate the frames shown in a . Integrated fluorescence intensity as a function of angle was determined as in c for each frame in the video sequence and was depicted by using a color scale . This contour plot shows fluorescence intensity in the cloud as a function of both time and angle . Note that there are two distinct peaks of actin density at 1 , 125 sec . Note also that each of the three peaks in the contour plot correlates with a velocity spike in f . This plot does not show the obvious asymmetry after the bead starts moving because the fluorescence intensity of the tail is far below that of the actin cloud . ( e ) Cloud asymmetry for this bead as a function of time . An asym - metric distribution of actin filaments gradually builds in the cloud before each burst of speed . ‘‘Asymmetry’’ here is a scalar describing the degree to which actin filament density is concentrated in a particular sector of a circle centered on the bead . Asymmetry is calculated by computing the SD of the fluorescence intensity as a function of u and normalizing to the mean values at each time point . A perfectly spherical cloud ( SD 5 0 ) would have an asymmetry of 0 , but , due to the finite noise in fluorescence intensity , the measured asymmetry is larger . ( f ) Velocity of this bead as a function of time . Superimposed on apparently random thermal motion of the particle are several sharp velocity peaks that correspond to peaks in actin filament density apparent in d before the rapid escape of the particle near the end of the sequence . Biophysics : Cameron et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 96 ( 1999 ) 4911 molecular motors such as myosin and kinesin ( 25 , 26 ) . 0 . 5 - m m beads move at rates comparable to L . monocytogenes in cell extracts , regardless of the protein surface density on the bead . However , smaller beads ( which are more likely to form tails ) move at slower rates . One proposed ‘‘Brownian rachet’’ mech - anism for actin polymerization - driven movement requires that the object being moved ( in this case , the bead ) diffuse far enough from the tip of the elongating actin filament to allow intercalation of a new actin monomer ( 27 ) . In this model , smaller beads are predicted to move faster , with velocity proportional to the diffusion coefficient . Our results rule out this model . However , other Brownian rachet models in which the actin filaments themselves undergo thermal fluctuations are still viable ( 7 ) . ActA - dependent movement requires the establishment of an asymmetric distribution of actin filaments on or near the bead surface . Asymmetry may arise from either self - reinforced fluctuations in actin filament density and crosslinking , which can be exaggerated by thermal motion , or by surface asym - metry of the particle . If asymmetry is introduced by shadowing of the beads , larger objects are able to move , and lower ActA surface densities will support initiation of movement . This suggests that bacteria must distribute ActA asymmetrically on the cell surface because their size is relatively large . For smaller objects that use actin comet tails to move , such as vaccinia virus ( 10 ) and lipid vesicles ( 11 ) , our observations suggest that symmetry may be broken spontaneously . In contrast to bac - teria , there is no clear mechanism by which viruses or vesicles could establish stable surface asymmetry , so the self - reinforced spontaneous symmetry breaking we have observed provides a satisfying explanation for their ability to initiate unidirectional movement . The simplified system we describe here represents important general features of cytoskeletal self - organization and actin - based motility . Local application of a chemotactic agent near the surface of a motile eukaryotic cell can result in local actin polymerization , extension of lamellipodia , cell polarization , and directed movement of the cell toward the chemotactic agent . Remarkably , motile eukaryotic cells exposed to a uniform concentration of a chemotactic agent will spontane - ously develop cytoskeletal polarity and will initiate rapid movement in a persistent , random walk , even though they have no signal gradient to move up ( 28 ) . Our results suggest that this spontaneous self - organization and inclination toward polarity is an inherent property of actin cytoskeletal dynamics . Local protrusive or propulsive force due to accumulation of poly - merized actin is a cooperative response that is highly depen - dent on filament crosslinking and other factors . Our in vitro system recapitulates this important general feature of actin self - organization in a highly simplified manner . Asymmetry is required for directional motility and may de - velop from local variation in density of nucleation sites , random fluctuations in local filament density , thermal fluctu - ations in the position of the nucleating structure , or a combi - nation of all three . Because of the nonlinearity and positive feedback mechanisms built into the cytoskeleton , any source of asymmetry can be amplified and reinforced to allow initiation of unidirectional movement . The dynamic actin cytoskeleton is poised to push and will jump at any excuse to do so .
