Nevertheless , these dividing cells , like other cells , probably undergo spontaneous mutation at a rate of 10 (cid:1) 9 per nucleotide . Because each mutant has only a few progeny , the overall biological properties of the cell culture are not altered unless a mutation provides a survival or growth advantage . Clonal evolution that leads to emergence of a dominant mutant genotype may potentially affect cellular phenotype as well . We assessed the genomic ﬁdelity of paired early - and late - passage hESC lines in the course of tissue culture . Relative to early - passage lines , eight of nine late - passage hESC lines had one or more genomic alterations commonly observed in human cancers , including aberrations in copy number ( 45 % ) , mitochondrial DNA sequence ( 22 % ) and gene promoter methylation ( 90 % ) , although the latter was essentially restricted to 2 of 14 promoters examined . The observation that hESC lines maintained in vitro develop genetic and epigenetic alterations implies that periodic monitoring of these lines will be required before they are used in in vivo applications and that some late - passage hESC lines may be unusable for therapeutic purposes . We analyzed nine pairs of early - and late - passage hESC lines and one unpaired line that had been cultured for variable numbers of passages ( range , 22 – 175 passages ; mean , 59 passages ; median , 34 passages ; Table 1 ) . We used three assays , each of which provides an independent read - out of alterations in the cellular DNA : nuclear DNA copy number , mitochondrial DNA sequence and gene promoter methylation 1 – 3 . The Affymetrix high - density oligonucleotide array – based SNP plat - form simultaneously uses two independent restriction digests and array - hybridization experiments to generate genotype and copy num - ber information on B 115 , 000 SNPs distributed across the human genome 1 . Analysis of SNP data for the nine paired samples did not show substantial genotypic differences between early - and late - passage DNA above those expected from genotyping error ( o 2 in 10 , 000 ; data not shown ) . There was a single exception for cell line pair SA002 / 2 . 5 , which had 240 SNP discrepancies ( Supplementary Table 1 online ) ; 206 of these discrepancies were localized to chromosome 13 , which was deleted in the late - passage hESC line ( Fig . 1b ) . The nearly identical genome - wide SNP pattern in the paired hESC lines provides a ‘DNA ﬁngerprint’ for each line , conﬁrming that the paired hESC lines that we examined were derived from the same individual . We also assessed nuclear DNA copy number alteration using the Affymetrix GeneChip Chromosome Copy Number Analysis Tool ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) . To avoid false positive results , we applied strict criteria for assessing copy number variation and calculated a moving average of hybridization intensity across all ten adjacent SNPs . We also required any change to be observed on both independently hybridized oligonucleotide arrays . Of the nine paired cell lines , four ( 45 % ) had observable copy number alterations during cell culture in late passages ( Table 1 , Fig . 1b – d and Supple - mentary Fig . 1 online ) . The copy number aberrations in late - passage lines ranged from large genomic regions of ampliﬁcations or deletions , such as ampliﬁcation of the entire 17q arm , to more discrete changes , such as a 2 - Mb ampliﬁcation encompassing the MYC oncogene . We validated all array - based copy number changes observed in the four paired cell lines using either ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) or genomic quantitative PCR ( Q - PCR ; Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) .

To assess whether the hemizygous deletion in the unpaired H1 line was a germline or somatic event , we analyzed the SNP data from 452 SNPs in this region . A somatic event would lead to a mixed population of haploid and diploid cells , which would negatively affect the assessment of genotypes and result in a reduction of heterozygote calls . We observed only 21 heterozygous SNPs in this region ( Supplementary Table 2 online ) , signiﬁcantly fewer than in the other cell lines examined ( P o 0 . 007 ) . We also observed a signiﬁcant increase in SNPs that could not be assigned a genotype – 1 . 5 – 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 + 0 . 5 + 1 . 0 + 1 . 5 – 1 . 5 – 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 + 0 . 5 + 1 . 0 + 1 . 5 – 1 . 5 – 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 + 0 . 5 + 1 . 0 + 1 . 5 H9 H7 hES2 X 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chromosome X 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Chromosome C op y nu m be r d i ff e r en c e C op y nu m be r d i ff e r en c e C op y nu m be r d i ff e r en c e a b c d – 1 . 5 – 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 + 0 . 5 + 1 . 0 + 1 . 5 SA002 / 2 . 5 C op y nu m be r d i ff e r en c e Figure 1 Comparison of copy number status between early - and late - passage hESC lines .

Notably , even though none of the individual copy number alterations were observed in more than one hESC line , they encompassed genomic regions or genes with altered dosage in human cancers , such as gains of chromosome 17 or 20 ( refs . 4 , 5 ) , loss of chromosome 18 ( ref . 6 ) and ampliﬁcation of the MYC oncogene 7 . We screened the mitochondrial genome of the nine paired hESC lines using a mitochondrial resequencing oligonucleotide array , which is capable of detecting heteroplasmic mutations in as few as 2 % of cells 2 . Mitochondrial DNA mutations are commonly observed in most human cancers 8 , but tissue - speciﬁc mutations can also arise as a consequence of aging 9 . We identiﬁed six heteroplasmic sequence alterations occurring in two of nine ( 22 % ) late - passage hESC lines and conﬁrmed these by conventional dideoxy sequencing ( Table 2 ) . Five of these alterations occurred in the coding region : three resulted in missense mutations in mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydro - genases 1 , 2 and 4 ( MT - ND1 , MT - ND2 and MT - ND4 , respectively ) , and one caused a nonsense mutation in ATPase 6 ( ATP6 ) , which probably affects the protein’s function . Aberrant methylation of the 5 ¢ - end gene promoter regions asso - ciated with gene silencing is an epigenetic phenomenon observed in almost all human cancers 10 , as well as a natural consequence of aging in some tissues 11 . Consequently , we investigated whether late - passage hESC lines had altered methylation patterns during tissue culture . We used real - time quantitative methylation - speciﬁc PCR ( Q - MSP ) to quantify the promoter methylation status of a panel of 14 genes selected for their function and known differential methylation in cancer tissues compared with most non - neoplastic cell types ( Supplementary Table 3 online ) 12 , 13 . Q - MSP analysis of nine pairs of hESC lines detected differential methylation of three genes ( RASSF1 , TNFRSF10C ( also called DcR1 ) and PTPN6 ) in the late - passage lines ( Fig . 2 ) . None of the other 11 genes showed evidence of promoter methylation in either early - or late - passage hESC lines . The best example of differential methylation was observed with RASSF1 , a putative tumor suppressor gene localized to chromosome 3p21 . 3 ( ref . 14 ) , for which we observed increased methylation in seven of nine ( 77 % ) late - passage lines relative to the corresponding early - passage lines . Five of these seven early - passage lines ( at passages 11 – 33 ) had no detectable methylation of the RASSF1 gene promoter , whereas two of the seven lines ( at passages 55 and 59 , respectively ) had evidence of methylation , suggesting that epigenetic alterations of the RASSF1 promoter may accumulate over time in vitro . Epigenetic silencing of RASSF1 gene by promoter methylation is a feature of many human cancers , whereas most non - neoplastic cell types are characterized by unmethylated promoters 15 , 16 . We also observed differential methyla - tion of TNFRSF10C and PTPN6 in early versus late passages , but the changes were less frequent than those in RASSF1 . In total , eight of the nine ( 89 % ) late - passage hESC lines had higher levels of promoter methylation than in their paired early - passage lines . Previous reports on stability of cultured hESC lines focused on alterations detectable through traditional karyotypic analyses only and led to conﬂicting ﬁndings . One group reported recurrent gains of chromosomes 17q and 12 ( ref . 17 ) , whereas several others reported stable hESC karyotypes for up to 2 years in passage 18 – 20 .

Our results are also at variance with a recent study 21 that found a substantial degree of epigenetic stability in cultured hESC lines , as inferred from maintenance of allele - speciﬁc expression and promoter methylation patterns at six imprinted loci . Three of the four hESC lines they analyzed are in common with our panel ( H7 , H9 and hES3 ) , and all three showed evidence of promoter methylation . Our study establishes that most , but not all , hESC lines maintained in tissue culture acquire a variety of clonal DNA alterations that dominate late passages . Notably , many of the genomic alterations we observed in late passages are likely to provide a growth advantage , such as ampliﬁca - tion of MYC or methylation of RASSF1 ( refs . 7 , 16 ) . Our study is limited to the empirical determination of genomic alterations in cultured hESC lines and does not address why these alterations arise or what their functional consequences for late - passage hESC lines could be . Given the enthusiasm for the application of hESC lines in clinical practice , however , there is little doubt that the scientiﬁc community will need to address both issues aggressively in the near future . In hESC lines stratiﬁed by culture conditions and passaging technique , we noted a bias for occurrence of copy number abnor - malities in late passages that were maintained in feeder - free condi - tioned medium and passaged by enzymatic methods ( three of ﬁve paired hESC lines ) versus those maintained on feeders with mechan - ical dissociation ( one of four paired lines ) ; however , this distinction was not apparent when we compared epigenetic abnormalities ( Fig . 2 ) . Nevertheless , this observation bears further analysis in a larger series of hESC lines and may inﬂuence decisions regarding how these lines should be cultured . Additionally , whether the genomic alterations observed have a detrimental effect on the ‘stemness’ of late - passage hESC lines , as deﬁned by self - renewal and clonogenic proper - ties , or their eventual in vivo therapeutic applicability will need to be determined . The latter question is especially important , as some of the observed genetic alterations , such as oncogene ampliﬁcation or tumor suppressor gene silencing , could affect cell kinetics in vivo . Notably , given that genomic alterations in hESC lines tend to accrue over time in tissue culture , they do not detract from the therapeutic potential of early - passage lines , which seem to be largely free of such measurable changes . Our ﬁndings , instead , mandate periodic monitor - ing of hESC lines for various types of genomic mutations using well - deﬁned assays , especially for changes that are likely to affect cellular phenotype . Finally , given the evidence for clonal aberrations in late passages , it is likely that the limited repository of cells sanctioned for research funded by the US government might further deplete over time . METHODS Paired hESC samples . hESC lines obtained at varying time points in the course of tissue culture provide a unique opportunity for assessment of genomic ﬁdelity during in vitro propagation . Therefore , we examined nine pairs of hESC lines , each consisting of an early and a late sample separated by multiple tissue culture passages ( range , 22 – 175 passages ; mean , 59 passages ; median , 34 passages ) , for genomic alterations ( Table 1 ) . We obtained all hESC samples from federally approved providers , or collaborating laboratories , where the lines had been maintained under each laboratory’s standard conditions , as described in detail in Supplementary Methods online . Depending on sample availability , early - passage hESC lines ranged from 11 – 59 passages , and late - passage hESC lines ranged from 39 – 147 passages . In addition , we examined a tenth hESC line , H1 , for which only a single time point ( passage 80 ) was available . We obtained all hESC lines for genetic analysis as frozen cell pellets . No further passaging was done at either Johns Hopkins University or University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center ; DNA was extracted from the frozen hESC pellets at Johns Hopkins University and used for the various assays . The early and late passages were selected by the providing institutions solely on the basis of availability of adequate frozen cell pellets for DNA extraction and subsequent genetic assays . Assessment of copy number variation and genotyping . Affymetrix oligonu - cleotide arrays containing 115 , 571 SNPs were hybridized with genomic DNA as described 1 . We digested 250 ng of genomic DNA with either Xba I or Hin dIII , ligated adapters onto the digested DNA and carried out a generic PCR to preferentially amplify fragments of 250 – 2 , 000 bp in length . We then fragmented the samples , ﬂuorescently labeled them and hybridized them to the arrays in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol . We determined the genotypes using the software tool GDAS3 . 0 , with a 0 . 05 setting for both homozygous and heterozygous genotype calls . We carried out single - SNP copy number analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip Chromosome Copy Number Analysis Tool Version 2 . 0 ( ref . 22 ) . To reduce noise and potential false positives , we analyzed SNPs in a ten - SNP moving window and plotted each oligonucleotide array separately . The y axis indicates the difference in ploidy between the early - and late - passage cell lines . We merged the images from each array using Adobe Photoshop , and only changes observed on both arrays were considered to be true positives . Genomic Q - PCR and FISH . We carried out genomic Q - PCR to conﬁrm the ampliﬁcations in late - passage BG01 , H7 and SA002 / 2 . 5 lines and the hemi - zygous deletion in the unpaired H1 line . For each locus of interest , we designed two sets of primers from a representative gene mapping within the copy - number aberration locus and two sets of primers from a control gene on the same chromosomal arm ( or the other arm , as necessitated ) that mapped outside the copy number boundary . Sequences for primers and PCR conditions are available on request . We analyzed each primer set in triplicate using SYBR green chemistry on an ABI 3700 analyzer , such that six independent pairs of control and test gene cycle threshold ( C t ) values were obtained for each of two passages for each cell line . We then calculated relative change in late versus early passages using the 2 – DD Ct method , as described 23 , and 95 % conﬁdence inter - vals . For the unpaired H1 cell line , we used a Coriell lymphocyte DNA with diploid chromosome 18 copy number as reference . We carried out FISH on metaphase cultures of late - passage hESC lines H9 and H1 , using a previously described protocol with modiﬁcations 24 . We isolated DNA from the chromosome 1 BAC RP11 - 101E13 and chromosome 18 BAC RP11 - 1097J12 using standard alkaline lysis procedures , labeled the DNA with digoxigenin - 11 - dUTP using the DIG Nick Translation Mix ( Roche ) and detected the hybridized probes using anti – digoxigenin - ﬂuorescein Fab fragments ( Roche ) . Slide preparations were viewed using a ﬂuorescent micro - scope ( Nikon ) with the images captured and adjusted for signal intensity with Easyﬁsh software ( ASI ) ; we counted 25 nuclei to assess copy number variation . Mitochondrial resequencing . Sequences comprising both strands of the entire 16 , 569 - bp human mitochondrial genome were synthesized as overlapping 25 - mers on high - density oligonucleotide arrays with 8 - m m features . We tiled the Cambridge Reference Sequence as well as sequences representing 500 of the most common haplotypes observed in the Mitomap public database , which include single - nucleotide changes , insertions and deletions . The PCR and hybridization conditions we used were previously described 2 . Grid - alignment and genotype calls were assigned using RA Tools Ver1 . 0 . 5 based on the ABACUS algorithm 25 . Conventional dideoxy sequencing was done as described to conﬁrm sequence alterations 8 . Q - MSP . Genomic DNA was bisulﬁte - modiﬁed essentially as described 26 , and modiﬁed DNA was dissolved in 20 m l of sterile distilled water . We carried out real - time PCR analysis using a Chromo4 MJ Research real - time PCR system using TaqMan chemistry , as described previously 3 . Sequences for TaqMan primers , probes , and PCR conditions are available on request . We used the MYOD1 as an internal reference standard for real - time quantiﬁcation . Ampli - ﬁcation of MYOD1 is independent of its promoter methylation status , whereas the ampliﬁcation of test genes is proportional to the degree of cytosine methylation within the promoter amplicon . We used serial dilutions of SS1 - treated human genomic DNA from normal human lymphocytes to generate a standard curve . The methylation quantitative ratio was deﬁned as the ratio of 1102 VOLUME 37 [ NUMBER 10 [ OCTOBER 2005 NATURE GENETICS L E T T E R S © 2005 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / ww w . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e g e n e t i cs C t for test gene to C t for MYOD1 multiplied by 100 .
