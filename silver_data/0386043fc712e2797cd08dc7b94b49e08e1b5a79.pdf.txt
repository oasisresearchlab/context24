However , there have been few studies examining how it affected age - specific healthcare use by patients as related to the locations of healthcare institutions . We explore changes in healthcare use while focusing on age - specific patient groups and facility locations after the COVID - 19 pandemic . Methods : We compared two databases of cross - sectional outpatient health - insurance claims that have equivalent time points yearly and quarterly both before and after the COVID - 19 pandemic . We categorized patients of healthcare institutions into five age groups and two facility locations . Results : The number of claims in 2020 significantly decreased by about 15 % compared to 2019 . The greatest reduction was for patients aged under 20 ( - 43 . 7 % ) , followed by the 20 - 39 group ( - 15 . 0 % ) and the 40 - 59 group ( - 11 . 9 % ) . Moreover , the number of claims significantly decreased in both urban and rural areas ( p < 0 . 001 ) ; however , the magnitude of this decrease was greater in urban areas ( - 15 . 2 % ) than in rural areas ( - 10 . 8 % ) . The annual decrease in healthcare use by age groups and location of facility was still supported even after controlling for institutional covariates , except for the patient group aged 80 or over in rural areas . Conclusions : We found that the COVID - 19 pandemic critically affected healthcare use across age - specific population groups and different locations of healthcare institutions . It suggests there is a need for further research and policy implications as to whether the declining healthcare use among those age groups is in core health care , and as to whether there are any unmet healthcare needs . Keywords : COVID - 19 ; healthcare use ; health - insurance claim ; outpatient 4 Introduction COVID - 19 spread throughout the world in a few months after its onset in 2019 , which brought substantial changes to daily life . Individuals have postponed and even cancelled social meetings and avoided crowded places [ 1 ] as the risk of COVID - 19 infection has increased and spread . Moreover , a decrease in healthcare utilization often occurs during pandemic outbreaks [ 2 ] . As the COVID - 19 pandemic has continued , many studies have reported major changes in the utilization of healthcare services due to social distancing policies ( such as lockdowns and stay - at - home orders ) [ 3 - 5 ] . This pandemic has affected patient healthcare utilizations in various ways . Since COVID - 19 first emerged , decreases in healthcare utilization have been seen around the world . The existing literature about healthcare utilization reduction could be divided into three categories : overall healthcare utilization decrease , decrease in admissions from emergency departments during lockdown , and reduced admission for certain diseases . First , studies examining the overall decrease in healthcare utilization have focused on trends and factors related to healthcare utilization . During March and April of 2020 in Quaternary hospital in Melbourne , Australia , there were significant reductions in emergency presentations and hospital admissions , similar outpatient attendances , and increases in telephone / telehealth consultations [ 6 ] . There were also significant reductions in inpatient , emergency department , and outpatient admissions in Kaiser Permanente Southern California [ 7 ] , and there was an avoidance of healthcare utilization in South Korea [ 2 ] . Second , some studies have reported a decrease in the number of admissions from the emergency department ( ER ) during the lockdown period . After the lockdown in March 2020 in Italy , the number of urgent urological consultations decreased . Moreover , while the frequency of visits for patients with undeferrable or life - threatening conditions was unchanged , hospital visits for patient with less severe conditions decreased compared to 2019 [ 8 ] . Similarly , after lockdown in March 2020 in France , emergency psychiatry admissions decreased compared to 2019 [ 9 ] . In the case of out - of - hospital cardiac arrest patients , few patients survived until hospital admission , and fewer survived until hospital discharge , from March to April in 2020 [ 10 - 11 ] . In England , visits to emergency departments decreased after lockdown in March [ 12 ] . Lastly , other studies reported reductions in admission for certain diseases , mostly for vascular diseases ( i . e . , cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease ) and cancer . Admission reductions for acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , ST - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , and non - ST - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) , and fatality rate reductions in AMI and STEMI were found in March in Italy [ 13 ] . In addition , admissions for AMI decreased after March in California [ 14 ] , and in the US and UK , there were reductions in ST - Segment elevation cardiac catheterization laboratory activations and decreases in hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome [ 15 - 16 ] . Reductions in hospitalizations for stroke have also been found in China , Italy , Spain , the US , and UK . However , there was no 5 significant delay in stroke [ 4 , 17 - 20 ] . During the pandemic , the number of breast cancer screenings and breast cancer surgeries has decreased due to a suspension or reduction of breast cancer screening in response to COVID - 19 [ 21 - 22 ] . Further , the number of deaths from specific cancers ( e . g . , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , esophageal cancer , lung cancer ) has increased in England [ 23 ] . Most of the studies have reported that there has been a decrease in healthcare use worldwide [ 2 , 6 - 7 , 9 , 12 , 14 - 16 ] since the outbreak of COVID - 19 , which might have lowered the survival rates of patients with other diseases , but none of these studies investigated how COVID - 19 affected healthcare use in terms of age groups and the locations of healthcare institutions in Korea . Therefore , we aimed to determine ( 1 ) which age groups had the greatest reduction of healthcare use and ( 2 ) how those changes differed in terms of the locations of healthcare institutions in Korea . To our knowledge , this is the first study to examine the association between the COVID - 19 pandemic and healthcare use based on national healthcare data from 2019 to 2020 in Korea . Methods Study Design We adopted a retrospective study design with a two - year observation period that considers the years of 2019 and 2020 . As a counter part - time period , we compared the quarterly healthcare use of each year . Since the outbreak of COVID - 19 started at the beginning of 2020 in Korea , we compared the quarterly healthcare use of 2020 with that in the corresponding quarters of 2019 . This study took the number of health insurance claims submitted by health care institutions as a proxy variable of healthcare use , as had been done in previous studies [ 6 - 7 , 24 ] . We classified patients into five age - specific groups ( younger than 20 years , 20 - 39 years , 40 - 59 years , 60 - 79 years , and over 80 years old ) to capture the changes in their healthcare use , which we measured based on the number of health - insurance claims . There was no specific theoretical rationale behind considering these four age categories , as they only considered the changes of social roles of individuals in terms of the aging process . In Korea , the age at which one is considered to be an adult is 19 years old , and many people start working at the age of 20 . Generally speaking , middle age starts around 40 years old . Retirement from public organizations begins at the age of 60 . This research concluded that considering these four categories of age groups would make it easier to interpret the study result because each category represents children or students , the starting working age group , the middle age group , and the older group . We chose only health - insurance claims for outpatient visits , because these visits accounted for 98 % of all uses . This also allowed us to easily measure healthcare use because an outpatient visit only creates one claim . 6 Regarding the locations of healthcare institutions , we categorized two types of facility locations : urban and rural areas . If healthcare institutions were located in the administrative district areas called a “city” or “Gu” ( the Korean term ) , we coded these institutions as being located in an “Urban location” ; meanwhile , we coded institutions as being in a “Rural location” if they were called “Khun” . Generally speaking , these two types of facility locations serve different numbers of community residents : The former administrative district has more than 100 , 000 residents whereas the latter type has less than 100 , 000 residents . This study was approved by our institutional review board ( on March 17 , 2021 ) ( IRB no : 2021 - 036 - 001 ) . Data We adopted the national health - insurance claim data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service ( HIRA ) in Korea . HIRA is a semi - governmental agency that serves as a third - party administrator that provides impartial health - insurance claim reviews and assessment for healthcare providers and patients . We selected almost all the claims based on actual healthcare visits between January 1 , 2019 , and December 31 , 2020 . We analyzed 735 , 545 , 043 claims in 2019 and 625 , 992 , 793 claims in 2020 . Since health - insurance claim data could be submitted long after an illness had occurred , we also considered lagged time and thus included claims that were reviewed by June 30 , 2021 . However , as mentioned above , the inclusion criteria of the claims were actual healthcare visits between January 1 , 2019 , and December 31 , 2020 . According to the HIRA , 99 . 99 % of health - insurance claims are filed within six months . To strictly evaluate the reduction in health - insurance claims during the second year , we excluded healthcare institutions that ( 1 ) had no health - insurance claims during any of the four quarters of each year ( 4 . 3 % ) or ( 2 ) had no health insurance claims in either 2019 or 2020 ( 5 . 5 % ) . We also excluded ten medical clinics that had missing values for the numbers of physicians . The dependent variable is the number of health - insurance claims in 2019 and those in 2020 . To examine health care usage , we aggregated the number of health - insurance claims and compared them by equivalent quarters of each year : quarter 1 ( Q1 ) of 2019 versus ( vs . ) Q1 of 2020 , quarter 2 ( Q2 ) of 2019 vs . Q2 of 2020 , quarter 3 ( Q3 ) of 2019 vs . Q3 of 2020 , and quarter 4 ( Q4 ) of 2019 vs . Q4 of 2020 . The main independent variables were the time difference between the equivalent time points ( yearly and quarterly ) in the baseline period ( 2019 ) and in 2020 . We evaluated healthcare use in terms of the five age - specific patient groups and the two types of facility locations , i . e . , urban or rural . The other independent variables included the years of operation , ownership ( profit or non - profit status ) , the number of physicians , and market competition , as measured by the Herfindahl – Hirschman Index ( HHI ) based on the formula of a previous study [ 25 ] . We used two variables for market share : the number of health insurance 7 claims from each hospital or clinic and the administrative district for the boundary measure of the local market . Statistical Analysis First , we examined the mean differences between health - insurance claims in terms of age - specific groups and the locations of facilities , both yearly and quarterly , in 2019 and 2020 . Then , we analyzed the descriptive statistics of the hospitals , such as years of operation , ownership status , number of physicians , and market competition . We used mean values for numeric variables and proportions for categorical variables . After looking at the basic descriptive statistics , we investigated the correlations between the independent variables to exclude those with overly high correlations from the final model . Before conducting the final analysis , this study performed the Modified Park test to determine the family of distribution for the generalized linear models ( GLM ) following other previous studies [ 24 , 26 ] . A gamma distribution was recommended in the test . Finally , we applied a GLM with log link and gamma distribution controlling for the institutional characteristics , while using SAS 9 . 4 for the statistical analysis . Results General Characteristics of the Study Subjects Table 1 presents the general characteristics of the study subjects , of whom there were 29 , 770 in total . There was a slight difference in the average number of physicians between the urban and the rural locations of healthcare institutions , with respective values of 3 . 1 and 1 . 8 . The score of the HHI was lower for the urban healthcare institutions than it was for the rural ones ; that is , there was higher competition in urban areas . < Table 1 here > Changes in Healthcare Use by Age Group Table 2 shows the changes in health - insurance claims in terms of the different age - specific categories . Overall healthcare use decreased by 14 . 9 % from 2019 to 2020 . The greatest decline was in the group under 20 , followed by the declines among patients aged 20 - 39 and 40 - 59 . Interestingly , healthcare use was reduced more in younger patients . 8 < Table 2 here > Changes in Healthcare Use by Quarterly Time Points Table 3 lists the changes in the number of health - insurance claims for each quarter . We found that the number of health - insurance claims differed by quarter ( Q1 , - 7 . 9 % ; Q2 , - 18 . 8 % ; Q3 , - 12 . 2 % ; Q4 , - 19 . 9 % ) . Within each quarter , the magnitude of the changes increased as patient age decreased , except for in quarter 1 . < Table 3 here > Figure 1 presents the quarterly healthcare use during 2019 and 2020 . The y axis represents the number of uses ( in millions ) . The figure clearly shows a reduction in healthcare use from 2019 to 2020 . The rate of reduction was the highest among patients under age 20 , followed by those among patients aged 20 - 39 and 40 - 59 . < Figure 1 here > Changes in Quarterly Healthcare Use by Location of Healthcare Institution Table 4 presents the changes in the numbers of health - insurance claims in terms of facility location between 2019 and 2020 . We found that there was a significant decrease in healthcare use in both urban and rural areas ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . However , the magnitude of decrease was higher in urban areas than it was in rural areas ( - 15 . 2 % versus - 10 . 8 % ) . The patterns of changes by quarter between urban and rural areas were similar among the different groups of patients , except for the patients aged 80 or over in Q4 of the urban areas ( p = 0 . 0186 ) . < Table 4 here > 9 Changes in Healthcare Use After Controlling for Healthcare Institutional Covariates Table 5 presents the change in the number of health - insurance claims from 2019 to 2020 in terms of patient age groups and the location of healthcare institutions after controlling for institutional characteristics , including years of operation , ownership , number of physicians , and HHI . We found that healthcare use by patients was significantly decreased in 2020 compared to that in 2019 , except among patients aged 80 or older who visited healthcare institutions located in rural areas . < Table 5 here > Discussion In this work , we investigated how the COVID - 19 pandemic has affected healthcare use , while focusing on the age structure of the patient population and on the locations of healthcare institutions . We found that the COVID - 19 pandemic affected healthcare use differentially across age groups and across locations of institutions . There was a significant decrease in healthcare use by patients under age 20 which was the largest among any group , followed by that by patients who were 20 - 39 years old , but we could not observe any difference for patients who were 80 years old or older . Decreases in healthcare use mainly occurred more at healthcare institutions located in the urban areas . For the age structure of the patient population , it was very interesting to find that the magnitude of decrease in healthcare use was highest for patients under age 20 . Our study results may be aligned with those of several other studies . According to a study investigating the number of clinic visits compared with the baseline period ( March 1 - 7 , 2019 ) , clinic visits decreased significantly for children aged 3 - 5 and 6 - 17 during the COVID - 19 pandemic in the United States [ 27 ] . Another study found that the spread of COVID - 19 increased as the age of the population increased [ 28 ] . We directly suggest that healthcare use by the elderly may increase regardless of COVID - 19 . Children aged 0 - 14 are less susceptible to infectious diseases like COVID - 19 than adults 15 - 64 years of age [ 29 ] . Whether or not younger individuals had some features strong enough to resist COVID - 19 infection , there were also various social and political initiatives to protect specific age groups of the population , such as children and teenagers . The reductions of healthcare use in this group should be interpreted in terms of various social movements . National governments and most societies have prioritized protecting the young generation . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , there were many governmental restrictions on activities including in the education systems in Korea . For example , elementary , middle , and high schools 10 were day - off during the COVID - 19 pandemic , as were colleges and universities . These kinds of governmental and social activities would reduce any accidents or events of those groups that would result in any use of healthcare , which would then reduce overall healthcare use . Several studies examining COVID - 19 have found that the social stringency policy is critically associated with the diminishing number of COVID - 19 cases [ 28 ] . Several other studies have also shown that social restrictions have helped reduce the spread of COVID - 19 cases [ 29 - 31 ] . Our finding that the patient groups aged 20 - 39 had the next highest reduction in healthcare use might be related to the results among the patient group aged under 20 . Generally speaking , the patients aged 20 - 39 years old might be householders or heads of families having children under 20 years old . Thus , the reduced healthcare use by patients under 20 years old might have affected healthcare use by patients who were 20 - 39 years old who were avoiding disease infection . Moreover , there were also many social actions , such as office days off and working from home . These kinds of governmental and social actions might have reduced healthcare use among these age groups . By contrast , the magnitude of changes in healthcare use by patients who were 60 - 79 and age 80 or older was not large enough . These groups were adults who likely might have lived alone or required continuous medical care . Thus , they would very likely have constantly used healthcare , even after the COVID - 19 pandemic . In one study , COVID - 19 confirmation was found to be associated with community and close - contact exposures of adults aged 18 and older [ 32 ] . A study conducted in the US also indirectly supports our interpretation that the COVID - 19 epidemic was retriggered by the age groups 20 - 49 [ 33 ] . Patients aged 80 years old and over were those who required continuous medical care and assistance . Individuals aged 65 and older are susceptible to infection by acute respiratory diseases , including COVID - 19 [ 27 - 34 ] . Thus , it is not expected that there would be much change in healthcare use before and after the COVID - 19 pandemic in this group . In terms of the locations of healthcare institutions , we did not find that any institutions ( in either urban or rural areas ) equally experienced the reduction of healthcare use . However , the magnitude of reduction was greater in urban areas than it was for facilities in rural areas , perhaps because COVID - 19 is so infectious ; therefore , people living in urban areas are more likely to be careful about infection , which would reduce healthcare use even further . By contrast , rural facilities would tend to have patients who are older and living alone , who may have required continuity of care because of their relatively poor health , and who would have continuously visited hospitals and clinics located in rural areas , which would not reduce healthcare use as much as for urban facilities . However , there was no similar study on this issue , and we hope to conduct a future study examining this topic . 11 This study has the following limitations : First , we did not include any variables representing the types of healthcare institutions . This decision was made because the number of physicians was significantly associated with the types of healthcare institutions . Second , we did not include various other environmental factors , such as residential population or age distribution of a local area . Third , this study only included outpatient health insurance claims , and it did not include inpatient claims , hospitalizations , health care costs , or length of stays . There are many indices measuring healthcare use . Thus , its interpretation would be very limited to outpatient section . We hope that our next study could consider these variables . This study is important based on the following two perspectives . First , this is the first national study investigating healthcare use in terms of both age - specific patient groups and the locations of institutions that has used the entire national health - insurance claim dataset in Korea . Because of the relatively short duration of the COVID - 19 pandemic , there has been little research into this topic in Korea specifically . Second , our results describe what may happen for future healthcare use during other infectious - disease pandemics , particularly for the expectancy of healthcare use in terms of the age - specific structure of the patient population and locations of healthcare institutions . Finally , several future research directions are suggested to overcome these limitations . First , this study verified that healthcare utilization decreased differently depending on the types of age categories and speculatively explained that they would be related to various social activities and national governmental actions . A follow - up study needs to validate any connection between those activities and governmental actions with our preliminary results . Second , future research should also be focused on whether the reduction of healthcare use occurs in core healthcare or not in those age categories . It is important to ascertain whether core health care has decreased in a specific age group in which medical use has reduced . Third , future studies targeting different measure of healthcare use such as hospitalization , inpatient care , tests , and so on should also be considered . These types of future studies would provide further crucial knowledge , information , and precautions to prevent the spread of coming infectious disease . Conclusions We found that the COVID - 19 pandemic critically affected healthcare use across age - specific population groups and locations of healthcare institutions . The greatest change occurred for patients under 20 years old , followed by that for patients aged 20 - 49 . For the types of healthcare institutions , urban facilities were likely to have greater reductions in healthcare use than those in rural areas . We hypothesized that various governmental initiatives and social actions against the COVID - 19 pandemic in our society would affect the healthcare use of patient populations differently . By narrowing down the study topic and subjects , we will be able to further explore 12 and verify how social actions would affect the reduction of healthcare use . We expect that similar age - demographic changes would occur if there were another infectious - disease pandemic ; therefore , healthcare policy makers need to pay attention to our results when the next pandemic comes . It is also necessary for future studies to verify whether core health care has decreased in those specific age groups where medical use has declined . Policy - makers also need to confirm whether there are any unmet healthcare needs . 13 References 1 . Lee , M . , & You , M .
