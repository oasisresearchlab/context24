Rogers 1 , 14 , 15 & Andras Nagy 1 , 2 , 15 Pluripotency is defined by the ability of a cell to differentiate to the derivatives of all the three embryonic germ layers : ectoderm , mesoderm and endoderm . Pluripotent cells can be captured via the archetypal derivation of embryonic stem cells or via somatic cell reprogramming . Somatic cells are induced to acquire a pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) state through the forced expression of key transcription factors , and in the mouse these cells can fulfil the strictest of all developmental assays for pluripotent cells by generating completely iPSC - derived embryos and mice . However , it is not known whether there are additional classes of pluripotent cells , or what the spectrum of reprogrammed phenotypes encompasses . Here we explore alternative outcomes of somatic reprogramming by fully characterizing reprogrammed cells independent of preconceived definitions of iPSC states . We demonstrate that by maintaining elevated repro - gramming factor expression levels , mouse embryonic fibroblasts go through unique epigenetic modifications to arrive at a stable , Nanog - positive , alternative pluripotent state . In doing so , we prove that the pluripotent spectrum can encompass multiple , unique cell states . Somatic cells that have lost their pluripotentproperties throughtheac - quisition of differentiation - associated epigenetic marks can be driven toacquireaninducedpluripotentcell ( iPSC ) statebytheforcedexpres - sionofkeytranscriptionfactors 1 . iPSCscanfulfilthestrictestofmurine developmentalassays , tetraploidembryocomplementation 2 , toformto all the cells of the embryo proper and the resulting adult animal 3 . Dur - ingthereprogrammingof somaticcells , itisvisiblyapparentthatthere existsa spectrumof distinctcelltypes . Theembryonicstem cell ( ESC ) - like iPSCs capable of generating healthy mice represent just one end of thisspectrum . Manystudies describethesuccessfulderivationofiPSCs , however , relatively few studies address the fate of cells that do not re - program to an ESC - like state . It has been reported that somatic cells expressing the four reprogramming factors 1 can stabilize at a Nanog - negativecellstatethatmorphologicallyresemblesESCs , yetfailedtofully acquireanESC - likeexpressionprofile 4 – 6 . ‘Partiallyreprogrammedcell’ hasbecomeatermtodescribeanycellthatfailstoreprogramtoanESC - like state . However , it is likely that a range of cell types exist , whose stable phenotypes and associated epigenetic profiles are different from ESCs . For somatic cells to acquire an ESC - like state they require extensive genome - wide remodelling , with epigeneticmechanismsregulating cell state transitions throughout the entire reprogramming process . In - complete remodelling of the somatic epigenome is associated with transgene - dependent cells 5 and a functional memory of somatic cell origin 7 , 8 . The modulation of epigenetic regulators such as DNA diox - ygenases 9 , histonedeacetylases 10 , H3K36demethylase ( Jhdm1b ) 11 , H3K27 demethylase ( Utx ) 12 and H3K9 demethylases 6 greatly influences the efficiencyandkineticsofreprogrammingtowardsaESC - likeiPSCstate . In particular , vitamin C has been reported to facilitate the transition of cells from a ‘partially reprogrammed state’ to an ESC - like state 6 , 13 . In additionto chromatinremodelling , the expression level of reprogram - ming transcription factors directs cell state . A narrow window of Oct4 expressionisrequiredtomaintaintheESCstate , wherebyatwofoldper - turbation of expression induces cells to transition to a non - ESC state 14 . Duringreprogramingtherearetwopotentialsources ofOct4 : thetrans - gene , whose expression has to be high at the beginning , and the endo - genousgene , whichisreactivatedduringtheprocessofreprogramming . Towards the end of reprogramming the total expression of these two Oct4sourceshas tostabilize withinthenarrowwindowrequiredbythe ESC - like state . Elevated expression of the four reprogramming factors hasthepotentialtodirectcellidentitytoanon - ESC - likestate . Inagree - ment , significant changes in global gene expression are observed when the reprogramming factors are shut down 15 – 17 .

Thus , inanexperimentalapproach unbiased by pre - conceptions of what constitutes a reprogrammed cell we characterize the diversity of cell states that arise during somatic cell reprogramming . We define a Nanog - positive cell state ( F - class cells ) that is stable , occurs frequently , is dependent on high reprogramming factor expression , in which cells do not form typical ESC - like colonies , exhibits advantageous cell culture properties , and yet demonstrates pluripotency . 1 Lunenfeld - TanenbaumResearchInstitute , MountSinaiHospital , Toronto , OntarioM5G1X5 , Canada . 2 InstituteofMedicalScience , UniversityofToronto , Toronto , OntarioM5T3H7 , Canada . 3 Department ofMedicalBiophysics , UniversityofToronto , Toronto , OntarioM5T3H7 , Canada . 4 DepartmentofMolecularGenetics , UniversityofToronto , Toronto , OntarioM5T3H7 , Canada . 5 GenomicMedicineInstitute , MedicalResearchCenter , SeoulNationalUniversity , Seoul110 - 799 , SouthKorea . 6 DepartmentofBiomedicalSciences , SeoulNationalUniversityCollegeofMedicine , Seoul110 - 799 , SouthKorea . 7 DepartmentofBiochemistry , SeoulNationalUniversityCollegeofMedicine , Seoul110 - 799 , SouthKorea . 8 DepartmentofSystems & ComputationalBiology , AlbertEinsteinCollegeofMedicineofYeshiva University , Bronx , NewYork10461 , USA . 9 QueenslandCentreforMedicalGenomics , InstituteforMolecularBioscience , TheUniversityofQueensland , StLucia , Queensland4072 , Australia . 10 Australian InstituteforBioengineeringandNanotechnology , TheUniversityofQueensland , Brisbane , Queensland4072 , Australia . 11 GenomeBiologyDepartment , TheJohnCurtinSchoolofMedicalResearch , The AustralianNationalUniversity , Acton ( Canberra ) , AustralianCapitalTerritory2601 , Australia . 12 VictorChangCardiacResearchInstitute , Darlinghurst ( Sydney ) , NewSouthWales2010 , Australia . 13 Life ScienceInstitute , MacrogenInc . , Seoul153 - 781 , SouthKorea . 14 DepartmentofPhysiology , UniversityofToronto , Toronto , OntarioM5T3H7 , Canada . 15 DepartmentofObstetricsandGynaecology , UniversityofToronto , Toronto , OntarioM5T3H7 , Canada . { Presentaddress : QIMRBerghoferMedicalResearchInstitute , GenomicBiologyLab , 300HerstonRoad , Brisbane , Queensland4006 , Australia . 1 9 2 | N AT U R E | V O L 5 1 6 | 1 1 D E C E M B E R 2 0 1 4 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©2014 Reprogramming diversity To extensively characterize the diversity of cell states arising from em - bryonic fibroblasts , we initiated reprogramming with the doxycycline - inducible piggyBac transposon system 18 . Colonies of proliferative cells werepickedina randomizedmanner , impartialofgeneexpressionand morphologicalappearance , establishingclonally - derivedcelllines ( Fig . 1a ) . Notably , the transgene - expressing cell lines segregated into two distinct cohorts ( Fig . 1b ) , which we had initially classified by morphological appearance as compact colony forming cells ( C - class ) and fuzzy col - ony forming cells ( F - class ) . For all 28 cell lines established , the repro - gramming genes Oct4 ( also known as Pou5f1 ) , Sox2 , Klf4 and c - Myc were expressed many fold above ESC levels ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) , with each clonal cell line exhibiting substantial global gene expression differences when compared to ESCs ( Fig . 1b ) . The majority of genes ( 67 % ) that were expressed above ESC levels were also expressed above ( . twofold ) parental fibroblast levels ( Extended Data Fig . 1b , c and SupplementaryInformation1 ) , suggestingthatthesegeneswereinduced upon reprogramming rather than representing a fibroblast memory . 2 , 959differentiallyexpressedgenes ( P , 0 . 01 ; falsediscoveryrate ( FDR ) , 0 . 05 ) separated F - class and C - class cells , ( Extended Data Fig . 1d , Supplementary Information 2 ) with the F - class cell lines being parti - cularly intriguing as they expressed Nanog and endogenous Oct4 at ESC levels ( Extended Data Fig . 1e , 2a , b ) , yet did not possess an ESC - like morphology ( Fig . 1b ) . The fuzzy appearance of F - class colonies and low intercellular adhesion was reminiscent of E - cadherin - null ESCs 19 – 21 andcouldbeattributedtodiminishedE - cadherinexpression ( Extended Data Fig . 1e ) . When mapped to the previously established PluriNet 22 ( Extended Data Fig . 1f ) , F - class cells exhibited significantly reducedexpressionofmanyPluriNetgenes ( Dnmt3b , Zfp42 and Tdgf1 ) , yet they expressed many genes at ESC levels such as Sall4 , endogenous Oct4 and Nanog ( Supplementary Information 3 ) . In addition , the F - classcellsexpressedtranscriptionfactorsassociatedwithlineagecom - mitment including the homeobox protein En2 , the helix – loop – helix factor Ngn3 and homeobox protein Nkx2 . 3 . We compared the F - class cells to another well - characterized plurip - otent stem cell population , epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) , and found that the F - class cellsare transcriptionallydistinct ( Extended Data Fig . 2c , d ) . Furthermore , F - class cells could not be generated or maintained in EpiSC media ( Extended Data Fig . 2e ) . An alternative stem - cell state Differentially expressed genes ( P , 0 . 01 ; FDR , 0 . 05 ) between ESCs and F - class cells are enriched with genes involved in cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix ( Fig . 2a , b ) , which probably contributes to the morphological appearance of F - class cells . Forced expression of Cdh1 inducedsomecellstoacquireanESC - likemorphology ; however , itwas insufficientformostcellsinculture ( ExtendedDataFig . 3a , b ) , suggest - ing that Cdh1 was not the only factor required . Furthermore , elevated Cdh1expressiondidnotinducetheexpressionof Esrrb and Dppa5 , genes that are downregulated in Cdh1 - null ESCs 20 ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) . The F - class gene expression profile remained unchanged upon pro - longed culture , with cells maintaining a stable transcriptome and no convergencetowardsanESC - likestate ( Fig . 2c ) . Independentsub - lines exhibited low variance in gene expression , further demonstrating the stable self - renewal of the F - class cell state ( Extended Data Fig . 3c ) . The absence of interspersed Dppa4 - expressing cells suggested that cells do notspontaneouslyprogresstoanESC - likestateatadetectablerate ( Ex - tendedDataFig . 3d ) .

Thecellsremainedinatransgene - dependentstate ( ExtendedDataFig . 3f ) , whereby turning off transgene expression induced population - wide differentiationwithin48h , demonstratingthatcellshadnottransformed . The self - renewal of F - class cells was independent of LIF or JAK sig - nalling ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) ; furthermore , F - class cells can be generated in media supplemented with JAK inhibitor ( Extended Data Fig . 4c – f ) . F - class cells rapidly proliferated to the extent that , when mixed with ESCs , an initial 1 % F - class cells became the dominant cell type ( . 50 % ) withinthreepassages ( ExtendedDataFig . 4g ) . Stablegene expression , rapid proliferation ( Extended Data Fig . 4h ) and low inter - cellularadhesion ( ExtendedDataFig . 4i ) conferF - classcellswithhighly desirable properties for stirred suspension culture . Teratomas initiated by pluripotent cells ( ESC , ESC - like iPSC and F - class cells ) contained well - differentiated ( non - dividing ) and less dif - ferentiateddividingcompartments . TheteratomasfromtheF - classcells were indistinguishable from those derived from ESCs , each consisting of complexdifferentiatedtissuesrepresentingallthreegermlayers ( Fig . 2d ) . In vitro , removal of doxycycline in serum - free media initiated efficient neuraldifferentiationofF - classcells , generating multipleneuronal sub - types ( Extended Data Fig . 5a – c ) . Differentiation in serum - based media generated cells representative of the mesoderm ( a - SMA 1 ) and endo - derm ( FoxA2 1 ) lineages ( ExtendedDataFig . 5d ) .

In summary , we describe a novel cell state that is distinct from ESCs yet passes criteria used to function - ally identify the pluripotent potential of human ESC and iPSC lines , as by the teratoma - forming assay . Requirement of transgene expression To determine the influence of transgene expression levels on the establishmentofF - classandESC - likestates , weexaminedthreediffer - ent reprogramming systems : three - factor ( 3F ) , which excludes c - Myc ; low - expressing four - factor ( 4F ; Col1a1 transgenic secondary system 23 ) ; and high - expressingfourfactor , 1Bsecondarysystem 18 ( ExtendedData Fig . 6a , b ) . High - expressing 4F fibroblasts underwent population - wide proliferationandgenerateddistinctcolonieswithin5days , whichstabi - lizedatastatemorphologicallyandtranscriptionallyresemblingF - class cells ( Extended Data Fig . 6c – e ) . In contrast , 3F and low - expressing 4F fibroblasts sporadically ( , 0 . 1 % ) gave rise to colonies from day 10 on - wards , stabilizing at a state that morphologically and transcriptionally resembled ESCs ( Extended Data Fig . 6c – e ) . During low - expressing 4F reprogramming , no morphologically overt F - class cells were observed atanytimepoint , norwereF - classidentifiergenesexpressedatelevated levels ( Extended Data Fig . 6f ) . These observations suggest a model whereby low - transgene - expressing cells do not generate an F - class cell state ( Extended Data Fig . 6g ) . We found that high four - factor express - ion can also reprogram adult tail skin fibroblasts to the F - class state ( Extended Data Fig . 7a – c ) . During somatic cell reprogramming retroviral transgenes become silenced and it is thought that this helps stabilize a fully reprogrammed ESC - likestate 24 . SinceF - classcellsrequiremaintainedtransgeneexpres - sion , we questioned whether a retroviral transgene system could give rise to F - class cells . We initially observed rapidly dividing cells posses - sing an F - class morphology ( days 8 – 16 post - transduction ) ; however , wedidnotobservethesecellsbeyondday30 . Retrovirus - deliveredtrans - gene expression ( green fluorescent protein , GFP ) was attenuated during transposon - mediated reprogramming to an F - class state and within established F - class cells ( Extended Data Fig . 7d , e ) . We propose that silencing of the retroviral transgenes is not compatible with the F - class cells’ requirement for high transgene expression . To examine the continued requirement of all four reprogramming factors , F - class cells were generated where three factors are constitu - tivelyexpressedandthefourthfactorisdoxycycline - inducible . Doxycy - cline was removed at day 30 and in all four cases turning off the fourth factor induced a rapid loss of proliferation and a flattening of cell mor - phology ( data not shown ) . Thus , all four reprogramming factors are needed to maintain the F - class state . The consistent inability to obtain F - class cells with 3F reprogramming indicates that elevated c - Myc ex - pression is necessary . We used the TetO - Myc F - class cells , and found thatupondoxycyclineremovaltherewasadownregulationofgenesin - volved ingrowthfactoractivityandpositiveregulation oftranscription ( Extended Data Fig . 8a – d ) , in accordance with a reduced proliferation . AlthoughcellsdidnottransitiontoanESC - likestate , anumberofESC - associatedgeneswereupregulated ( ExtendedDataFig . 8c , Supplemen - tary Information 4 ) , supporting the theory that reprogramming factor expressionactivelysuppressesthefinalacquisitionofanESC - likestate 15 . Cell - state transitions We questioned whether re - expressing the reprogramming factors at high levels in the ESC - like state would induce a transition to the F - class state . Reprogramming factor expression was re - activated in the iPSC line 1B 18 and cells were transferred to media conditions that are conducive to F - class cells but not ESC - like cells : JAK inhibition in the absence of LIF and feeders ( Extended Data Fig . 8e , f ) . Within 48 h , col - onies of cells arose that morphologically resembled F - class cells . These cells maintained expression of some ESC - associated genes ( Lin28 and Dnmt3B ) yetdiminishedotherssuchas Dppa5 , Dnmt3l and Cdh1 ( Ex - tended Data Fig . 8g ) . Notably , cells upregulated genes expressed by F - classcells , suggesting thatelevated reprogrammingtransgene expres - sion can induce an F - class - like state , with the starting cell type ( ESCs or MEFs ) leaving a signature on the F - class cell state . Next , weinvestigatedwhetherestablishedF - classcellscanbeinduced to transition to an ESC - like state . Exposure to the DNA methyltransfer - ase inhibitor 5 - aza - deoxycytidine ( Aza ) was toxic at active concentra - tions ( . 0 . 05 m M ) , whilevitaminC ( ascorbicacid ) supplementationand 2imediafailedtoinduceanESC - likemorphology ( Fig . 3aandExtended Data Fig . 9a ) . In contrast , inhibition of histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) induced F - class cells to acquire an ESC - like morphology ( Fig . 3a ) and transcriptional profile ( Fig . 3b , Extended Data Fig . 9a ) . To determine whetherHDACinhibition ( HDACi ) selectsforasub - populationofcells , we exposed twelve newly established subclones to HDACi and found that they acquired an ESC - like morphology and consistently upregu - late ESC - like markers ( Extended Data Fig . 9b ) .

The upregulation of chromatin - related factors possibly facilitated the transcriptional activation of fur - ther ESC - associated genes .

All rights reserved ©2014 Discussion In this study , we observed that reprogramming somatic cells , in the presence of elevated reprogramming factor expression , could stabilize at a Nanog - positive fuzzy colony forming ( F - class ) state . Previous studiesmayhaveoverlookedthisstateastheF - classcellshighlyexpress Nanog without completing oneof theearlyreprogramming events , the mesenchymaltoepithelialtransition 16 , 29 . Chanandcolleaguespreviously describedahumanreprogrammedcelltype ( typeIIcells ) thatisNanog - positive and persists in a state that represents an intermediate stage of somaticcellreprogramming 30 . IncontrasttothehumantypeIIcells , the murineF - classcellsdonotmorphologicallyresembleESCs , nordothey transcriptionally or epigenetically represent an intermediate cell state thatreprogrammingcells transitthroughastheyacquireESC - likestate . Two central observations support the notion that the F - class cell state is not representative of an intermediate state . First , F - class cells upregu - late a cohort of genes that were not observed during reprogramming withoutc - Myc ( 3F ) orwithlow - levelfour - factor ( Oct4 , Klf4 , Sox2and c - Myc ) expression . Second , theexpressionofthesegenesinF - classcells is associated with the loss of repressive epigenetic marks ( H3K27me3 and / or DNA methylation ) that are typically present in the parental fibroblasts and the ESC - like state . The loss of these repressive marks suggests that , during sustained reprogramming factor expression , cell identity is diverted away from the molecular pathway that leads to an ESC - like state ( Fig . 5 ) .

All rights reserved ©2014 In conclusion , the F - class cells represent an acquired state and not an intermediate state that all reprogramming cells transition through on the way to an ESC - like state . We propose that the F - class cell state is stably maintained as a conse - quenceofhighreprogrammingfactorexpressionandmultipleepigeneticdeterminants . Through elevated expression of the four reprogramming factors we showed that F - class cells could be generated from both fi - broblastsandESC - likeiPSCs . Notably , thecelltypeoforiginleavesdis - tinct signatures on the resultant F - class cells , as an imprint of their respective origin . The ability to reprogram cells to novel cell states , such as the F - class state , can be harnessed to create a variety of artificial cells that possess desirablepropertiesforregenerativemedicineanddrugdiscovery , such as the ability for scalable expansion in bioreactors and reproducible differentiation . ESCs are themselves an artificial in vitro cell state , captured during a brief developmental window and require specific culture conditions for their maintenance . The F - class cell state can be consideredtobea distantpluripotentrelativeoftheESC state . Thefre - quencyatwhichF - classcellsariseintransposon - basedreprogramming , in combination with their advantageous properties , presents the op - portunity to study and utilize a novel pluripotent cell type in biology , medical research and future medicine .
