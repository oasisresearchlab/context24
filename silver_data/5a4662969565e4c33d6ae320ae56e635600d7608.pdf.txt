All rights reserved . purified proteins , Scar1 induces the slowest rate of nucleation . WASP activity is 16 - fold higher , and N - WASP activity is 70 - fold higher . The data for all activators fit a mathematical model in which one activated Arp2 / 3 complex , one actin monomer , and an actin filament combine into a preactivation complex which then undergoes a first - order activation step to become a nucleus . The differences between Scar and N - WASP activity are explained by differences in the rate constants for the activation step . Changing the number of actin binding sites on a WASP family protein , either by removing a WH2 domain from N - WASP or by adding WH2 domains to Scar1 , has no significant effect on nucleation activity . The addition of a three amino acid insertion found in the C - terminal acidic domains of WASP and N - WASP , however , increases the activity of Scar1 by more than 20 - fold . Using chemical crosslinking assays , we determined that both N - WASP and Scar1 induce a conformational change in the Arp2 / 3 complex but crosslink with different efficiencies to the small molecular weight subunits p18 and p14 . Conclusion : The WA domains of N - WASP , WASP , and Scar1 bind actin and Arp2 / 3 with nearly identical affinities but stimulate rates of actin nucleation that vary by almost 100 - fold . The differences in nucleation rate are caused by differences in the number of acidic amino acids at the C terminus , so each protein is tuned to produce a different rate of actin filament formation . Arp2 / 3 , therefore , is not regulated by a simple on - off switch . Precise tuning of the filament formation rate may help determine the architecture of actin networks produced by different nucleation - promoting factors . Introduction nucleation machinery . The nucleation machinery consists of the Arp2 / 3 complex , a heteromeric complex of seven Eukaryotes use a dynamic actin cytoskeleton for many processes , including cell division , phagocytosis , intracellu - polypeptides that nucleates and crosslinks actin filaments , and a nucleation - promoting factor that binds the Arp2 / 3 lar trafficking , and cell locomotion [ 1 , 2 ] . In response to cellular signaling events , including the activation of Rho complex and increases its nucleation activity [ 3 ] . The most well - studied nucleation - promoting factors are pro - family G proteins , cells construct specialized networks of actin filaments . The first step in de novo nucleation of teins of the WASP / Scar family [ 4 – 6 ] . In vertebrates , this group consists of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein actin filaments is localization and activation of the actin - 1904 Current Biology Vol 11 No 24 ( WASP ) , its more widely expressed cousin , N - WASP , and ization ( t 1 / 2 ) at saturation is 42 s for WASP WA , 29 s for N - WASP WA , and 147 s for Scar1 WA ( Figure 1c ) . The at least three homologs of the Dictyostelium suppressor of cAMP receptor ( Scar ) protein , Scar1 - 3 . The C - terminal correct metric for nucleation activity is the rate at which new filaments are formed , so we determined the time regions of the WASP family proteins ( WA regions ) contain course of filament generation stimulated by the three either one ( WASP and Scar ) or two ( N - WASP ) actin mono - proteins ( Figure 1d ) . We calculated the number of grow - mer binding domains , called WASP - homology 2 ( WH2 ) ing filament ends at different points in a polymerization domains [ 7 ] , and a stretch of acidic residues ( A ) at the reaction ( Figure 1b ) from the instantaneous slope and extreme C terminus that interacts directly with the Arp2 / 3 concentration of unpolymerized actin and then plotted complex [ 8 ] . These WA regions are sufficient to stimulate barbed - end concentration versus time ( Figure 1d ) . Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization , but the molecu - lar details of the nucleation process remain a mystery . The WASP and N - WASP generate approximately four times WA regions are quite similar , and it has been generally as many filaments over the course of a polymerization assumed that their activities are equivalent . reaction as Scar1 ( Figure 1d ) . The initial rates of nucle - ation in the presence of WASP and N - WASP , however , We show here that the WASP / Scar family proteins induce are much more than four times the rate induced by Scar1 . conformational change ( s ) in Arp2 / 3 , and in vitro WA do - In the presence of WASP and N - WASP , the polymeriza - mains from different WASP / Scar family proteins initiate tion reaction comes to plateau within 60 s , while Scar1 dramatically different kinetics of actin polymerization . does not generate a detectable number of filaments for The maximal nucleation activity is determined by the more than 50 s . acidic Arp2 / 3 binding region , not by the number of actin binding WH2 domains or by the affinity of the activator . Because Arp2 / 3 requires filamentous actin for maximal We constructed a mathematical model to both describe activity , it is formally possible that the difference in poly - the mechanism of Arp2 / 3 activation and to provide a con - merization kinetics is caused by a different dependence venient metric for Arp2 / 3 activity . We incorporated all on preformed actin filaments . To address this , we used of the measured rate and equilibrium constants for the fluorescence microscopy and measured the degree of interactions between actin , Arp2 / 3 , and the WASP family Arp2 / 3 - dependent filament branching in the presence of proteins along with an additional activation step . The Scar1 WA and N - WASP WA . If N - WASP activity is more model contains only three floating parameters and more rapid because it can generate new filaments without a accurately describes Arp2 / 3 - dependent polymerization preexisting mother filament , we would expect N - WASP than a previously proposed model based on barbed - end WA activity to produce less filament branching than Scar1 branching [ 9 ] . The observed differences between the ac - WA . In contrast , we find that N - WASP WA induces a tivities of Scar1 WA and N - WASP WA domains can be slightly higher degree of filament branching ( see Figure accounted for by varying the rate constant governing the S1 in the Supplementary material available with this arti - activation step . cle online ) . In particular , N - WASP generates a signifi - cantly larger number of highly branched structures con - Results taining two or more branches each . This is consistent with WASP and N - WASP stimulate Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization much more rapidly than Scar1 N - WASP stimulating filament formation by a more rapid filament - dependent mechanism . We fluorescently la - We tested the ability of N - WASP WWA ( a construct con - taining both WH2 domains ) and Scar1 WA ( a construct beled and imaged filaments produced by N - WASP and Scar1 WA at times when the reactions contained equal containing only one ) to stimulate actin polymerization in Acanthamoeba extracts doped with pyrene actin . Previous polymer mass . The reduced branching in the presence of Scar1 WA , therefore , may reflect increased debranching studies have shown that the addition of GTP (cid:1) S to these extracts stimulates actin polymerization [ 10 ] via the acti - at the longer time required for Scar1 to generate the same polymer mass as N - WASP . Also , the slower activity of vation of Rho family GTPases . N - WASP WWA induces actin polymerization even more efficiently than GTP (cid:1) S Scar1 means that spontaneous nucleation makes a larger relative contribution to filament number . ( Figure 1a ) . However , no amount of added Scar1 WA induces detectable polymerization . Arp2 / 3 - dependent filament formation is not a linear func - tion of time , so it is difficult to quantitatively compare To understand the differences between N - WASP and Scar1 , we directly compared the abilities of the proteins the initial nucleation rates .

The points indicate deviation . ing factor , and one Arp2 / 3 complex on the side of an stable ends elongate rapidly , so we approximate that the activation step is irreversible ( this is a standard assumption actin filament .

To describe the entire time course of polymeriza - ments [ 11 ] , and nucleates new daughter filaments from tion , we coupled our nucleation model to a multistep model these mother filaments [ 4 , 12 , 13 ] . Also , the nucleation - of spontaneous polymerization described earlier [ 12 ] . promoting factors used in these studies are monomeric and contain an actin monomer binding site required for activity [ 7 ] .

[ 14 ] suggested that the binding of WASP increases the affinity of Arp2 / 3 chinery into a stable barbed end ( Figure 1e ) .

We tested the maximal nucleating at which nucleation activity is regulated ( see Table 2 ) . activities of saturating concentrations of the chimeric proteins and found that additional actin binding sites do not increase maximal activity ( Figure 3b ) . Second , we compared the activities of N - WASP WWA and N - WASP for actin filament , and we suspect that binding of an WA . Using pointed - end elongation assays , we determined actin monomer increases the affinity even further . We that N - WASP WWA appears to bind two actin monomers , determined values for these constants by global fitting while N - WASP WA and Scar1 WA bind one monomer of data sets collected with various Arp2 / 3 activators at each , with similar affinities ( Figure 3c ) .

We first detected the crosslinked species as a by an allosteric mechanism . We looked for conformational new band recognized by monospecific antibodies against changes within the Arp2 / 3 complex by chemical crosslink - ing with EDC / NHS . To better characterize intramolecu - the p18 subunit ( Figure 5a , band 1 ) that does not bind 1908 Current Biology Vol 11 No 24 Figure 4 monoclonal anti - his 6 antibodies that recognize the affinity tag on Scar1 WA and N - WASP WWA . Therefore , this band appears to be a specific intramolecular crosslink within the Arp2 / 3 complex that occurs only upon binding of N - WASP or Scar1 . The crosslinked band is also not recognized by antibodies against Arp3 , Arp2 , p40 , p35 , or p14 . Therefore , it represents either an intrasubunit crosslink that dramatically alters the electrophoretic mo - bility of p18 or an intersubunit crosslink between p18 and p19 ( for which we do not have a monospecific antibody ) . A p18 / p19 crosslink is consistent with previous two - hybrid results [ 8 ] , so we propose that , upon binding , N - WASP WWA and Scar1 WA induce a conformational change in the Arp2 / 3 complex that brings crosslinkable residues of p18 and p19 into contact . N - WASP and Scar1 crosslink to different small molecular weight subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex As reported previously , the binding site for N - WASP WWA and Scar1 WA involves contacts with the Arp2 , Arp3 , and p40 subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 16 ] . N - WASP WWA and Chimera A , both of which initiate rapid filament formation , crosslink to p14 ( Figure 5a , band 4 , and Figure 5b ) and p18 ( Figure 5a , band 3 , and Figure 5b ) . The relative intensity of band 3 is different when probed with the anti - his 6 or the anti - p18 antibodies . This difference probably reflects a change in the accessibility of the epitopes for the p18 antibody in the p18 / N - WASP WWA crosslink . Scar1 crosslinks to the p18 subunit but does not detectably crosslink to p14 . In a previous study , we did not detect a connection between Scar1 and p18 [ 16 ] . Reliable detec - tion of this interaction was made possible by our new antibodies and supports a previous study that found an association between Scar1 WA and the p21ARC subunit ( the mammalian homolog of amoeba p18 ) of the mamma - lian Arp2 / 3 complex in a yeast two - hybrid screen [ 8 ] . Discussion One of the major conclusions of this study is that the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex can be tuned to different values by different WASP family proteins . N - WASP WA stimulates actin polymerization in Acanth - amoeba extracts and , in assays with components purified The acidic domain of N - WASP is the major determinant of maximal from Acanthamoeba , promotes rapid actin nucleation fol - nucleation activity . ( a ) N - WASP / Scar1 chimeras used in this study . Scar1 WA and N - WASP WA were subdivided into four segments : WH2 , a LINKER region , a C segment that includes the cofilin homology domain , and the extreme C - terminal ACIDIC domain . Three conserved insertion of three amino acids ( shaded amino acids ) not chimeras were constructed between the N - WASP and Scar1 found in the Scar proteins .

Scar1 WA stimulates a 70 - fold used by Yamaguchi et al . is actually due to a difference in their affinities for Arp2 / 3 . slower rate of nucleation in vitro and is unable to stimulate actin polymerization in extracts . This difference is not Several metrics have been used to describe the nucleation due to a different dependence on preformed actin fila - activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , including the time to half - ments , but it appears to be a difference in the kinetics maximal polymerization [ 16 ] , the total number of actin of the nucleation reaction . Previously [ 10 ] , we showed filaments generated during an assay [ 14 ] , and the maximal that , because of filament capping , the number of free rate of polymerization [ 20 ] .

The total number of fila - ments generated in a polymerization assay is limited by Yamaguchi et al .

Consequently , the total number of filaments gener - it to the difference in the number of actin binding sites .

This is most clearly seen in Figure 1d , N - WASP WWA construct , containing two actin binding sites , to an N - WASP WA construct , which contains only in which the total number of filaments generated by N - WASP is only four times greater than that generated one .

Higgs et al . [ 19 ] showed A previous study [ 13 ] reported no significant difference that WASP family protein constructs fused to GST have in the activities of WASP WA and Scar1 WA . The authors significantly different activities compared to untagged compared the activity of bovine Arp2 / 3 stimulated with proteins . Also , GST fusion proteins are generally dimers , WASP WA to that of Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 stimulated with so a GST - WWA construct could potentially bind four Scar1 , so comparison was not direct . Also , the authors actin monomers and two molecules of Arp2 / 3 , further used total filament number as a metric of activity and confusing the relationship between nucleation and actin found that , depending on Arp2 / 3 concentration , Scar1 WA binding . Second , the two studies use different linker se - stimulation produced 50 % – 80 % as many filaments as quences between WH2 domains ( see the legend to Figure WASP WA . According to our analysis , a 2 - fold difference 3a , b ) . To make a Scar1 WWA construct , Yamaguchi et al . in filament number can correspond to a much higher fused amino acids 466 – 519 to amino acids 494 – 559 . In difference in the rate of filament formation . So , while our the present study , we built an analogous construct by observations are not inconsistent with those of Blanchoin fusing amino acids 497 – 516 to amino acids 487 – 559 . We et al . , our analysis indicates a larger difference in the chose these boundaries to maintain the spacing between activities of Scar1 and WASP than these authors ap - WH2 domains found in N - WASP .

Nucleation by activated Arp2 / 3 requires one molecule each of Arp2 / 3 and nucleation - promoting factor , Third , in the present study , we used saturating concentra - tions of Scar1 ( W ) WA proteins , so that our comparison of an Arp2 / 3 binding site on the side of a filament , and an actin monomer . The model fits the data well at multiple nucleation activities was insensitive to the affinity of the constructs for Arp2 / 3 . Yamaguchi et al . used 100 nM Arp2 / 3 and actin concentrations and provides a metric , the activation rate constant , for quantitatively comparing N - WASP / Scar1 ( W ) WA and 60 nM Arp2 / 3 complex . In our experiments , 100 nM N - WASP or Scar ( W ) WA is not the activities of different nucleation - promoting factors . Unlike other metrics discussed , our model - based metric sufficient to saturate the activity of 60 nM Arp2 / 3 com - plex . So , one possibility is that the apparent difference is largely independent of assay conditions ( e . g . , the con - centrations of actin and Arp2 / 3 ) and can be used to com - in activities between the Scar1 WA and WWA constructs Research Paper Control of Arp2 / 3 activity Zalevsky et al . 1911 pare results from different laboratories and different nu - Intracellular pathogens that spread from cell to cell by recruiting components of the host cell cytoskeleton may cleation - promoting factors . have already discovered the difference between N - WASP and Scar1 . Vaccinia virus and Shigella recruit N - WASP A model proposed by Pantaloni et al . [ 9 ] suggests that [ 23 , 24 ] , and Listeria monocytogenes uses ActA [ 25 , 26 ] , three actin monomers are required for Arp2 / 3 - dependent which has a nucleation activity indistinguishable from that nucleation . We tested this branched polymerization model of N - WASP [ 16 ] .

Three factors contribute to this failure ; factors that stimulate different rates of Arp2 / 3 - dependent first , spontaneous nucleation is modeled as actin dimeriza - actin filament formation ?

Second , the branched polymerization model proposes the organization of the actin cytoskeleton [ 27 , 28 ] . It is that three actin monomers combine with Arp2 / 3 to make a unclear how many of these differences are due to activa - new daughter filament .

Marchand et al . [ 14 ] report that this mutation does not alter the affinity for Arp2 / 3 , but decreases nucleation - promoting activity . In that study , WASP WA ( R477K ) Nucleation requires an activation step that can be sepa - generated half as many filaments as wild - type WASP WA . rated from actin and Arp2 / 3 binding ( Figure 2 ) .
