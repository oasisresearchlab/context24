Insights & Perspectives LRRC8 proteins share a common ancestor with pannexins , and may form hexameric channels involved in cell - cell communication Federico Abascal ! and Rafael Zardoya Leucine - rich repeat - containing 8 ( LRRC8 ) proteins are composed of four transmembrane helices and 17 leucine - rich repeats ( LRR ) . Although LRRC8 proteins have been associated with important processes , like maturation of B cells or adipocyte differentiation , their biology and molecular function are largely unknown . We found that LRRC8 proteins originated from the combi - nation of a pannexin and an LRR domain ( most likely related to the SHOC2 , LAP , RSU1 and LRRIQ4 protein families ) before the diversiﬁcation of chor - dates . We propose that , like pannexins , LRRC8 proteins form hexameric chan - nels , which participate in cell - cell communication processes . According to the inferred topological model , and contrary to what was previously assumed , the six LRR domains are located in the cytoplasm , and could participate in the organisation of signalling cascades . By compiling available proteomics and gene expression data , and on the basis of the LRRC8 proposed hexameric channel structure , we present clues to the function of this family . Keywords : . cell - cell communication ; communication junction proteins ; leucine - rich repeats ; LRRC8 ; pannexin Introduction The leucine - rich repeat - containing 8 ( LRRC8 ) protein family was discovered in 2003 [ 1 ] , but the biological functions of its members remain poorly under - stood . The ﬁrst lrrc8 gene was isolated from a human patient suffering congen - ital agammaglobulinemia [ 1 ] . The patient lacked B cells in peripheral blood and a truncated LRRC8 gene was identiﬁed as the cause of disease . Subsequently , LRRC8 proteins were reported in differ - ent chordates , usually asﬁve paralogues , which were named LRRC8A ( the ﬁrst described ) , B , C , D and E , respectively . LRRC8A is also known as AGM5 , LRRC8B as TA - LRRP , and LRR8C as FAD158 [ 2 ] . Based on the shift in the expression of the lrrc8B gene after stimulation of per - ipheral blood mononuclear cells , it was proposed that LRRC8B had a role in the activation of lymphocytes and mono - cytes [ 2 ] . The LRRC8C protein was found to be essential for the proper differen - tiation of adipocytes [ 3 , 4 ] . LRRC8D and E have been less studied , and their functions are unknown . LRRC8 proteins are composed of four transmembrane ( TM ) segments , located in the ﬁrst half ( amino - termi - nus ) of the protein [ 2 ] , and a leucine - rich repeat domain ( LRRD ) with up to 17 leucine - rich repeats ( LRRs ) situated in the second half ( carboxyl - terminus ) [ 5 ] . LRRDs are usually involved in protein - protein interactions [ 6 , 7 ] and partici - pate in processes related to innate immunity [ 8 ] , neuronal development [ 9 ] and apoptosis [ 10 ] . LRRC8 proteins were originally assumed to be located in the plasma membrane , with the LRRD pointing towards the outside of the cell [ 1 ] , as in most ( if not all ) animal LRR - containing receptors ( e . g . Toll - like and hormone receptors ) .

The transmembrane region of LRRC8 proteins is evolutionary related to pannexins Different methods of sequence compari - son based on proﬁle searches ( see Supporting information ) were used to identify other proteins with statistically signiﬁcant similarities to the ﬁrst half ( amino end TM region ) of LRRC8 proteins . HMMER v3 [ 11 ] searches initiated with a multiple alignment of LRRC8 proteins against SwissProt / TrEMBL identiﬁed pannexins as the clos - est hit with a highly signiﬁcant e - value ( 2 . 3e - 09 ) . Reciprocally , similarly exe - cuted searches initiated with a multiple alignment of pannexins recovered LRRC8 proteins as the best hit ( 1 . 2e - 08 ) . In addition , HMMER v2 and PFSEARCH [ 12 ] searches conducted at MyHits [ 13 ] yielded the same hits and highly signiﬁ - cant e - values . The direct contrast of the independent alignments of LRRC8s and pannexins using the proﬁle - proﬁle com - parison HHALIGN 1 . 5 . 1 . 1 program [ 14 ] resulted in an e - value of 9 . 5e - 08 . Overall , the e - values obtained are strong enough to conﬁdently support a close evolutionary relationship of LRRC8 proteins and pannexins . Pannexins are a family of communi - cation junction proteins [ 15 ] . The family is present in all metazoans but echino - derms . For historical reasons , and also because they perform different functions , pannexins from non - chordate animals are usually called innexins . In chordates , pannexins have been reported in tuni - cates and show three main groups of paralogy in vertebrates ( pannexin 1 , 2 and 3 ) . Although chordate and non - chor - date pannexins ( i . e . innexins ) share very little sequence similarity [ 16 – 18 ] , they possess a very similar topology , which consists of four TM segments that associ - ate into hexamers , resulting in homo - or heteromeric channels . In non - chordates , the innexin channels ( innexons ) from adjoining cells are connected producing a gap junction that allows cell - cell com - munication . In contrast , most authors consider that chordate pannexins do not form gap junctions ( in chordates this role is performed by connexins [ 16 ] ) , but rather act as single membrane channels ( pannexons ) [ 19 ] . These channels con - nect the cytosol and the extracellular space allowing direct passage of ions and small molecules [ 20 , 21 ] . Chordate pannexins have been associated to para - crine signalling and homeostasis in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , triggering Figure 1 .

LRRC8 originated from pannexins at the origin of chordates With the aim of reconstructing the phy - logeny of pannexins ( including innexins ) and LRRC8 proteins , we identiﬁed and retrieved members of these families from a set of reference animal species for which the genome is fully sequenced ( the list of species as well as other details of the methodology are available in the Supporting information ) . Multiple align - ments of the TM domain ( amino end ) of LRRC8 proteins and pannexins were per - formed using Mafft - L - INS - i [ 23 ] and inspected with Jalview [ 24 ] . Maximum likelihood ( ML ) and Bayesian inference ( BI ) tree reconstructions ( conducted with RAxML v7 . 2 . 8 [ 25 ] and MrBayes v3 . 1 . 2 [ 26 ] , respectively ) used the innexin of the cnidarian Hydra magnipapillata as the outgroup . LRRC8 proteins were recovered together with chordate pan - nexins with strong support ( 95 % ML bootstrap ; Bayesian posterior probability of 1 ) , to the exclusion of protostome innexins . A sister group relationship of craniate ( hagﬁsh þ vertebrates ) LRRC8 proteins and pannexins to the exclusion of Ciona pannexins was recovered although without statistical support ( Fig . 1 ) . The lack of resolution at this node could be related with the relatively long branch of the hagﬁsh for both proteins , and the unexpected presence of Nematostella LRRC8 and pannexin within both groupings ( see below ) . LRRC8 proteins and pannexins have orthologues in urochordates , cephalo - chordates and vertebrates , but groups of paralogy are restricted exclusively to the latter . Within vertebrate pannexins , up to three monophyletic groups corre - sponding to paralogues 1 – 3 were recov - ered with strong statistical support ( Fig . 1 ) . Pannexins 1 and 3 were recov - ered as sister groups to the exclusion of pannexin 2 ( Fig . 1 ) . Within vertebrate LRRC8 proteins , four monophyletic groups corresponding to LRRC8 paralogues B - E were recovered with strong statistical support ( Fig . 1 ) . Paralogue A was not recovered as a clade in these phylogenetic analyses but formed a monophyletic group if phylo - genetic reconstruction was restricted exclusively to the LRRC8 protein family ( see Supporting information ) . LRRC8A and B were recovered as sister groups whereas LRRC8D clustered with LRRC8C and E ( Fig . 1 ) . Given that LRRC8 paralogues B , C and D cluster together in the human genome ( 1p22 . 2 location ; [ 27 ] ) , it is most likely that these three paralogues arose by tandem dupli - cations . LRRC8A ( 9q34 . 11 ) and E ( 19p13 . 12 ) arose later by duplications of the LRRC8B and C genes , respectively . LRRC8 and pannexin paralogues diverged under different evolutionary constraints Sequence similarity between LRRC8 paralogues is higher than between pan - nexin paralogues , even though the two families share a common ancestor at the origin of chordates ( Table 1 ) . For instance , on average , human LRRC8s are 45 . 92 % identical ( maximum of 63 . 39 % , in the case of LRRC8E and C ; minimum of 37 . 08 % , in the case of LRRC8B and D ) whereas human pan - nexins are 34 . 29 % identical ( 42 . 90 % for pannexin 1 and 3 , 27 . 48 % for pan - nexin 1 and 2 , and 32 . 49 % for pannexin 2 and 3 ) . This suggests that the LRRC8 family is less diverse than the pannexin family , either due to higher selective constraints in the LRRC8 protein function or because diversiﬁcation in pannexins could be fuelled by positive selection and adaptation to new functions . Within each paralogue , the comparison of human LRRC8s and pannexins against the corresponding orthologues of other species ( Table 1 ) indicates that some paralogues have evolved under stronger purifying selection than others . For instance , human LRRC8A and pannexin 2 are about 85 and 75 % identical to acti - nopterygian orthologues , respectively , whereas LRRC8E and especially pan - nexin 3 are much less similar for the same taxon comparison ( Table1 ) . Interestingly , LRRC8B and LRR8E , which are the least conserved paralogues , were lost in acti - nopterygians and birds , respectively , which could probably be explained by the effect of relaxed selection . LRRC8 proteins may form hexameric channels Pannexins ( including innexins ) carry out their functions in the form of hex - americ channels . The close evolutionary relationship of the ﬁrst half of LRRC8 proteins with pannexins suggests that Table 1 . Evolution of the different LRRC8 and pannexin paralogues .

Pannexins and LRRC8 proteins share several well - conserved sequence and structural motifs Thorough inspection of an alignment combining LRRC8s and pannexins shows large insertions and deletions ( Fig . 2 ) . Yet , several well - conserved motifs common to both types of proteins are identiﬁed both in the TM helices and in the loops . According to the TM helix prediction programs TMHMM [ 28 ] and TOPCONS [ 29 ] , the four TM helices aligned well between the two families . In addition , the pairs of cysteines con - served in extracellular loops of gap junc - tion proteins ( innexins / pannexins and connexins ) are also conserved in LRRC8 Figure 2 . Alignment of human pannexins and LRRC8 proteins . Orthologous pannex - ins from zebraﬁsh were also included to obtain a more balanced representation of the two protein families . Residues are col - oured according to their physicochemical properties and to the degree of conservation with JalView .

Post - translational modiﬁcations are highlighted , as indicated in the legend . F . Abascal and R .

Cysteines are involved in the formation of stabilising disulphide bonds between adjacent loops in gap junction proteins [ 17 – 19 ] . Remarkable similarities between LRRC8s and pan - nexins also included a conserved motif just before the second TM helix , and the presence of several charged residues ( arginine , lysine , aspartate and gluta - mate ) in the loop between TM helices 2 and 3 ( Fig . 2 ) . Moreover , the most conserved TM helices 1 and 2 , which form the ‘pore funnel’ in the connexon [ 26 ] ( the connexon is the hexameric channel constituted by connexins ) , were also highly conserved in LRRC8 proteins . On the other hand , the third and fourth TM helices , which are the least conserved in innexins , pannexins and connexins were also the least con - served in LRRC8 proteins . Interestingly , the third helix does not participate in intermonomer interactions and is the one most exposed to the membrane , at least in the connexon . There are two large and sequence - variable insertions in LRRC8 proteins in the TM1 - 2 and TM2 - 3 loops . High throughput proteomic experiments show that these insertions are the target of different post - translational modiﬁ - cations : ( i ) the insertion between the ﬁrst and second TM helices is subjected to N - linked glycosylation , at least in LRRC8A and D [ 30 ] ; ( ii ) the insertion between the second and third TM helices is particu - larly rich in serine and threonine resi - dues , most of which can be phosphorylated [ 31 – 36 ] and ( iii ) , several lysine residues in the latter insertion are acetylated [ 37 ] or ubiquitinated [ 38 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , non - chordate ( i . e . innexins ) and chordate pannexins share fewer conserved positions [ 16 ] than pan - nexins and LRRC8 proteins ( Fig . 2 ) . LRRC8 proteins are not membrane receptors but instead have the same transmembrane topology as pannexins Almost all TM topology prediction algo - rithms [ 28 , 29 , 39 – 41 ] ( see Supporting information ) support the same topology for pannexins and LRRC8 proteins . Two extracellular loops connect the four TM helices , and the N - and C - terminal ( with the LRRD ) regions point to the cell cyto - plasm , as in other communication junc - tion proteins ( Fig . 3 ) . This result contrasts with what has been thus far assumed for LRRC8 proteins in the absence of experimental evidence , i . e . that the LRRD is outside of the cell as in canonical single pass TM LRR - contain - ing proteins [ 1 , 2 ] . In addition , several high - throughput proteomic studies , summarised in the NextProt and Phosphosite [ 42 ] databases , provided experimental evidence of numerous post - translational modiﬁcations of LRRC8 proteins that support the topo - logical model proposed here . Serine , threonine and tyrosine phosphoryl - ations ( which concentrate in the intra - cellular loop , between helices 2 and 3 ) , as well as lysine acetylations and ubiq - uitinations were placed inside the cell , whereas the few identiﬁed N - linked gly - cosylations , all pointed towards the out - side of the cell ( Fig . 3 ) . Furthermore , a characterisation of the cell surface pro - teome [ 30 ] identiﬁed peptides located at what our model would propose as the ﬁrst extracellular loop of LRRC8A and D . Close relatives of the LRR domain of LRRC8 include SHOC2 , LAP , RSU1 and LRRIQ4 protein families The LRRD in the second half ( carboxyl end ) of LRRC8 proteins usually contains 17 LRRs [ 5 ] . The LRRD is considered a promiscuous domain [ 43 ] that associ - ates with many different domains in diverse proteins , and is involved in protein - protein interactions [ 6 ] . With the aim of characterising the evolution - ary origin of the LRRD of LRRC8 proteins , we conducted proﬁle - based searches with PFSEARCH . We used masking techniques that hide repetitive leucines and asparagines ( particularly rich in this kind of repeats ) , to ﬁnd most similar protein families .

According to the reconstructed phy - logeny , the sister group of the LRRC8 LRRD is SHOC2 , although with only mod - erate support ( bootstrap 54 % ; posterior probability 0 . 77 ) . Indeed , it seems plaus - ible that LRRC8 originated from a family that has no other domains than LRRD , like SHOC2 or RSU1 ( Fig . 4 ) . To further understand the evolutionary origin of the different LRR - containing protein fami - lies , we scanned for members of these protein families in the fully sequenced genomes of diverse metazoans . We ident - iﬁed LRR - containing proteins in the pla - cozoan Trichoplax , the cnidarians Hydra and Nematostella , the nematode Caenorhabditis , the insect Drosophila , and several chordates , including tuni - cates , cephalochordates and vertebrates ( Fig . 4 ) . All families date back to the origin of metazoans except LRRC8 and likely LRRIQ4 , which appeared at the origin of chordates . Within the LAP fam - ily , the LANO subfamily probably arose from Scribble upon the loss of the PDZ domain in the ancestor of vertebrates . Since LRRC8 originated in the chordate ancestor , it should have been recovered within any of the analysed families ( e . g . SHOC2 ) of metazoan origin . It is likely that the high divergence of LRRC8 proteins precluded the correct placement of this family in the reconstructed tree , and thus , these results should be inter - preted with caution . The LAP proteins LRRC7 , Erbin and Scribble include a PDZ domain and play a key role in the establishment of cell polarity , as well as in disrupting Ras - Raf complexes [ 44 , 45 ] . LANO lost the PDZ domain and is involved in homeostasis Figure 4 . ML phylogeny of LRRC8 , SHOC2 , RSU1 , LRRIQ4 and the LAP protein family .

Ras suppressor protein 1 ( RSU1 ) pre - vents Ras oncogene - induced transform - ation and may inhibit cell migration [ 47 ] . SHOC2 is a scaffold protein that modu - lates Ras - dependent activation of Raf1 [ 48 ] . Finally , LRRIQ4 is a protein of unknown function [ 49 ] that contains an IQ calmodulin - binding motif [ 50 ] . Quaternary structure model of LRRC8 proteins : Could LRR domains function as hexamers inside the cell ? If LRRC8 proteins form membrane hex - amers like pannexins , we might expect interaction between the six intracellular LRRD . In fact , the reported haploinsufﬁ - ciency due to the dominant - negative effect on the phenotype of a mutant in one of the two alleles of LRRC8A [ 1 ] suggests that LRRC8A might form homo - typic complexes . Given the speciﬁc phys - icochemical nature of LRRs , 3D - structure models of LRRD should be reasonably accurate even when based on distant structural templates [ 51 ] . Although the twist of the solenoid can vary , recon - structions of the curvature of the sole - noid , the exposure of residues to solvent , and the orientation of amino acid side chains are usually very accurate [ 51 ] . From the models available at ModBase [ 52 ] , we selected entry 3cigA ( 28 % iden - tity , see Supporting information ) [ 53 ] , which corresponds to the mouse Toll - like receptor 3 , and models nearly the whole LRRD of LRRC8A ( repeats 2 – 17 and the ﬁnal C - tail ) . We used Consurf [ 54 ] to map the degree of evolutionary conservation onto this model ( Fig . 5 ) . Results reveal that there is a particularly well - con - served surface - patch on the convex side of the LRRD . Interestingly , electrostatic potential ( based on Coulomb inter - actions and partial charges , and calcu - lated with the Swiss - PDB Viewer software [ 55 ] ) revealed that the con - served patch is mostly positively charged . In comparison , the concave side presents a mixture of positive and negative charges , and the C - terminus is negatively charged ( Fig . 5 ) . Based on this 3D - structure model , we searched for docking solutions of two identically modelled solenoids with Zdock [ 56 ] , which conducts a rigid - body based docking search considering shape complementarity , desolvation and elec - trostatics . Many solutions were compat - ible with a hexameric structure . One in which the positively charged and con - served patch would interact with the negatively charged C - terminus was selected . We hand - built a quaternary model by placing three of these docked LRRD dimers onto the knownstructure of a connexon [ 57 ] . This model , of course , represents only one of many possible solutions , and is shown exclusively with the aim of representing the relative vol - ume of each domain , and to illustrate that the docking solution is compatible with a hexameric association ( Fig . 5 ) . The evolutionary origin and expression patterns of lrrc8 genes suggest a role of LRRC8 proteins in cell - cell communication The inferred hexameric - channel arrange - ment of LRRC8 proteins and their evolutionary relationship to pannexins suggest a putative role of LRRC8 proteins in cell - cell communication . If conﬁrmed , LRRC8 proteins could be predicted to be particularly relevant in cellular systems in which cell - cell communication is especially important , such as the CNS and the immune system . Indeed , the expression pattern of the LRRC8 family of genes across tissues and cell types , as obtained from the compilation of thou - sands of gene expression experiments by the Gene Expression Barcode [ 58 ] ( see Supporting information ) , is in agreement with this expectation . There are two paralogues that are ubiquitously expressed , namely lrrc8A and lrrc8D . In contrast , lrrc8B shows an expression pattern that is mostly speciﬁc to the nervous system and lrrc8C is strongly associated with the immune system . The expression of lrrc8E is limited but seems to increase its expression in some tumours , at least more frequently than the other paralogues . These expression patterns suggest that the LRRC8 protein family not only has important roles in common cell biology , but that they have also evolved particular functions in the nerv - ous and immune systems . Several members of the family , including LRRC8C ( the paralogue most Figure 5 .

Based on the expected struc - tural similarity of pannexons and connexons , and on the hypothesised ability of LRRC8 proteins to form channels , a possible quaternary model is shown . This was done by arrang - ing together , by hand , a connexon ( 2zw3 code in Pdb ) , and three dimers of the LRRD according to one of the multiple docking solutions found by the Zdock program .

The abundance of LRRC8 proteins in macrophages and lymphocytes might be involved in sensitising activated immune cells to incoming signals . Alternatively , or additionally , LRRC8 proteins might constitute channels through which activated cells send recruitment signals . Similar roles have been determined for pannexin 1 chan - nels , which mediate the release of ‘ﬁnd - me’ signals from apoptotic cells to recruit phagocytes [ 59 ] . This pattern also suggests that LRRC8 proteins could participate in immune synapses . Regarding the LRRC8B paralogue , its pattern of expression in the CNS is basi - cally restricted to the forebrain , in accordance with a global expression pat - tern characteristic of many genes inside the CNS [ 60 ] . The roles of LRRC8 proteins in the CNS might be similar or comp - lementary to the ones of pannexins , which are widely expressed there and have been proposed to contribute to non - synaptic communication between cells and to the regulation of Ca 2 þ homeostasis , among other functions [ 61 ] . Subcellular localisation of LRRC8 proteins resembles that of pannexins Additional evidence regarding putative functional similarities between pannex - ins and LRRC8 proteins is provided by the matching subcellular localisation of both . Pannexin lacks a signal peptide , and its trafﬁcking to the membrane fol - lows the classical ER - Golgi secretory pathway , which depends on glycosyla - tion [ 62 ] . Pannexins are known to per - form functions in intracellular Ca 2 þ signalling , acting as Ca 2 þ - leak channels in the ER . LRRC8 proteins also lack a signal peptide and are subjected to gly - cosylation , at least in the case of LRRC8A and D , the two most widely expressed paralogues [ 30 ] . Moreover , LRRC8A and D have been found at the surface of the cell [ 30 ] and LRRC8C at the ER [ 3 ] . Might LRRC8 proteins form gap junctions ? Insights from the cnidarian Nematostella Direct intercellular communication is considered an essential feature of multi - cellular organisms [ 63 , 64 ] , but unex - pectedly the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis contains no innexins . Instead , we identiﬁed one pannexin and up to six closely related LRRC8 genes in the genome of Nematostella . Surprisingly , orthologues of the LRRC8 proteins and the pannexin encoded by the Nematostella genome were placed with very strong statistical support at the base of the LRRC8 and pannexin chordate clades , respectively ( and not , as expected , together with the corre - sponding protein of the other cnidarian , Hydra , in the outgroup ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Our best hypothesis to explain the recovered phy - logenetic pattern is horizontal transfer of both lrrc8 and pannexin genes from an ancestral chordate to Nematostella . The multiple Nematostella LRRC8 paralogues would have arisen by means of succes - sive gene duplication events after the proposed horizontal gene transfer . It is not unreasonable to think that either the pannexin gene present in Nematostella or the multiple LRRC8 paralogues have taken on the roles of the missing innexins . Considering that gap junction proteins ( either innexins or connexins ) tend to be present in multiple copy - number in almost all met - azoans , the multiple Nematostella LRRC8 proteins might be considered as better - positioned candidates than the single pannexin for direct cell - cell communication . LRRC8 proteins might organise intracellular Ca 2 þ - sensitive signalling cascades According to the inferred topology of LRRC8 proteins , the LRRD points towards the cytoplasm , and the conven - tionally assumed role for LRRC8 proteins as surface receptors must be reconsidered . The model presented here and the evolutionary relationships of the LRRD suggest that LRRC8 proteins might participate in the organisation of signalling cascades . Interestingly , most ( if not all ) of the LRR - containing protein families that are most closely related to LRRC8 proteins share common func - tions . Proteins from the LAP family participate in the establishment of cell polarity , cell adhesion and different types of cellular junctions [ 44 , 45 , 65 , 66 ] . One of its subfamilies , Scribble ( LAP4 ) , regulates the MAP kinase cas - cade [ 67 ] . RSU1 regulates cell - adhesion and participates in the RAS signal trans - duction pathway , which is MAP kinase - mediated [ 47 ] . SHOC2 is a regulatory subunit of phosphatase 1 , and provides a scaffold for the interaction between M - Ras and Raf1 , activating the MAPK cascade [ 48 ] . Moreover , SHOC2 also interacts with Erbin ( LAP2 ) [ 48 ] . In addition , many of the above - mentioned LRR - containing proteins are sensitive to Ca 2 þ signalling [ 48 , 68 , 69 ] . The func - tion of LRRIQ4 is basically unknown [ 49 ] , but it contains an IQ ( calmodu - lin - binding ) domain [ 50 ] . On the other hand , pannexin channels have a funda - mental role in Ca 2 þ ﬂux into the cell and thus , in intracellular Ca 2 þ signalling [ 70 ] . They participate in cell junctions and synapses , playing active roles in paracrine signalling . Altogether , the two halves of the LRRC8 protein have evolved from proteins strongly related to membranes that actively regulate signalling cas - cades , suggesting that this might be the main functional role of LRRC8 proteins . Moreover , the evidence of numerous phosphorylations at the intra - cellular loop of LRRC8 proteins , and the potential role of the LRRD in bringing protein - kinases to the loop , might indicate that the function of LRRC8 proteins is strongly regulated by kinases . Interestingly , the lrrc8E is located beside the mapkk7 gene in vertebrates . Next steps in deciphering the functions of LRRC8 proteins A ﬁrst step would be the experimental validation of the proposed hexameric association of LRRC8 proteins into chan - nels and , ideally , the determination of their three - dimensional structure . In addition , the characterisation of the subcellular localisation of LRRC8 proteins would also provide useful information . Determining whether LRRC8 proteins are evenly distributed across membranes or show any kind of asymmetrical distribution ( e . g . immune synapses ) would help to clarify whether they are involved in direct or indirect ( paracrine ) cell - cell communi - F .

Considering the relevant role of pannexins at the ER [ 61 ] and that LRRC8C has already been detected at that particular location [ 3 ] , it would also be important to determine the function of LRRC8 proteins in this organelle . Characterisation of protein - protein interactions , transient or stable , with proteins that participate in signalling cascades and / or cell - cell junctions will also throw light on the function of these proteins . Finally , if it is conﬁrmed that LRRC8 proteins form hexameric chan - nels , additional research should focus on outlining the dynamics of these channels , determining how their aper - ture is regulated and whether they are sensitive to Ca 2 þ , as would be expected considering their evolutionary origins . Conclusions The ﬁnding that LRRC8 proteins origi - nated from the evolutionary combination of a pannexin and an LRR - containing protein suggests a potential role of LRRC8s as membrane proteins involved in the organisation and regulation of intracellular signalling cascades and in direct or indirect cell - cell communi - cation . This hypothesis is in contrast to their previously proposed role as recep - tors . Considering their evolutionary ori - gin and the conservation of some key structural characteristics , it seems likely that LRRC8 proteins form hexameric channels ( like pannexins ) with the six LRRDs arranged together in the cyto - plasm . The ﬁndings reported here need experimental conﬁrmation , but open new directions for characterising the biology and molecular functions of the poorly known LRRC8 family . Our results also reveal thatthe evolution of gap junc - tion proteins is far more complex than previously thought . They also reveal that innexins , which were key proteins for the acquisition of multicellularity at the ori - gin of metazoans , and were once thought to be exclusive to invertebrates , have diversiﬁed considerably in chordates , not only through gene duplication but also by domain shufﬂing .
