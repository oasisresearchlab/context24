Kedziora 2 , Kees Jalink 2 and Metello Innocenti 1 , * ABSTRACT Protrusion of lamellipodia and ruffles requires polymerization of branched actin filaments by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Although regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex activity has been extensively investigated , the mechanism of initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles remains poorly understood . Here , we show that mDia1 acts in concert with the Arp2 / 3 complex to promote initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles . We find that mDia1 is an epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - regulated actin nucleator involved in membrane ruffling using a combination of knockdown and rescue experiments . At the molecular level , mDia1 polymerizes linear actin filaments , activating the Arp2 / 3 complex , and localizes within nascent and mature membrane ruffles . We employ functional complementation experiments and optogenetics to show that mDia1 cooperates with the Arp2 / 3 complex in initiating lamellipodia and ruffles . Finally , we show that genetic and pharmacological interference with this cooperation hampers ruffling and cell migration . Thus , we propose that the lamellipodium - and ruffle - initiating machinery consists of two actin nucleators that act sequentially to regulate membrane protrusion and cell migration . KEY WORDS : Arp2 / 3 , Actin , Cell migration , Lamellipodia , mDia1 , Ruffles INTRODUCTION Lamellipodia and ruffles are thin sheet - like membrane protrusions composed of branched actin filaments ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) assembled by the actin - related protein 2 and 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex , an evolutionary conserved and intrinsically inactive seven - subunit protein complex ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ) . Activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex requires two cofactors , a pre - existing actin filament ( often referred to as mother actin filament ) and a nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Binding of these two cofactors enables the Arp2 / 3 complex to adopt the active conformation and nucleate a daughter actin filament from the side of the mother filament . The Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) proteins ( WAVE1 – WAVE3 ) are NPFs that have been shown to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex and induce the assembly of branched actin filaments in vitro ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . WAVE proteins form a stable complex with four other proteins ( Gautreau et al . , 2004 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ) , namely Abi - 1 ( or its paralogs Abi - 2 and Abi - 3 ) , Nap1 ( Nck - associated protein 1 , also known as NCKAP1 ) [ or its paralog HEM1 ( NCKAP1L ) ] , PIR121 ( also known as CYFIP2 ) ( or its paralog Sra - 1 , CYFIP1 ) and HSPC300 ( also known as BRK1 ) ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . Physical binding between activated Rac and PIR121 / Sra - 1 allows the WAVE complex to translate Rac signals directly into Arp2 / 3 - complex - dependent actin polymerization ( Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) . Knockdown or knockout of either WAVE complex subunit abrogates lamellipodium and ruffle formation ( Beli et al . , 2008 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ) , as well as phagocytosis and macropinocytosis ( Innocenti et al . , 2005 ; Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) . As depletion of the Arp2 / 3 complex causes similar defects ( Beli et al . , 2008 ; Rotty et al . , 2013 ; Suraneni et al . , 2012 ) , the WAVE and the Arp2 / 3 complexes are crucial components of the lamellipodium - and ruffle - making machinery . Formin proteins represent a different class of actin nucleators as they promote the polymerization of linear actin filaments ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . Formins are defined by an evolutionary conserved signature consisting of juxtaposed formin homology ( FH ) 1 and FH2 domains : the FH1 domain bindsthe G - actin - binding protein profilin thereby modulating how the flanking FH2 domain affects actin filament nucleation and elongation ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) . Human and mouse diaphanous 1 [ DIAPH1 and mDia1 ( also known as DIAP1 ) , respectively ] are orthologous formins collectively referred to as mDia1 . mDia1 bears a diaphanous inhibitory domain ( DID ) and a diaphanous auto - regulatory domain ( DAD ) enclosing the FH1 and FH2 domains at the N - terminal and C - terminal side , respectively ( Schonichen and Geyer , 2010 ) . Interaction between the DID and DAD keeps mDia1 auto - inhibited and is disrupted when activated Rho binds the GTPase - binding domain located just upstream of the DID ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) . Consistent with being activated by Rho , mDia1 also acts as a Rho effector , regulating actin - dependent processes ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ) . mDia1 is a component of the phagocytosis cup ( Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Colucci - Guyon et al . , 2005 ; Lewkowicz et al . , 2008 ) and might also localize at the leading edge of migrating cells and within ruffles ( Kurokawa and Matsuda , 2005 ; Watanabe et al . , 1997 ; Zaoui et al . , 2008 ) . The Arp2 / 3 - complex activation mechanism and the proteins composing the lamellipodium - and ruffle - making machinery are sufficient to faithfully describe the mechanism that sustains expansion of lamellipodia and ruffles ( Bugyi and Carlier , 2010 ; Insall and Machesky , 2009 ; Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . In addition , recent studies have identified inhibitory proteins for the Arp2 / 3 complex and have elucidated the mechanisms that cause retraction of lamellipodia and ruffles ( Chan Received 1 July 2015 ; Accepted 2 September 2015 1 Division of Molecular Genetics , The Netherlands Cancer Institute , Plesmanlaan 121 , Amsterdam 1066 CX , The Netherlands . 2 Division of Cell Biology I , The Netherlands Cancer Institute , Plesmanlaan 121 , Amsterdam 1066 CX , The Netherlands . * Author for correspondence ( m . innocenti @ nki . nl ) 3796 © 2015 .

However , we still ignore the mechanism of initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles because the origin and availability of the pre - existing mother filaments mediating initial activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex remain unknown . In this study , we have employed a multi - disciplinary approach to show that mDia1 polymerizes linear actin filaments for initial activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex within nascent lamellipodia and ruffles . The finding that mDia1 plays an essential role in the mechanism of initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles shows that the lamellipodium - and ruffle - initiating machinery consists of two actin nucleators that act sequentially to regulate membrane protrusion and cell migration . RESULTS mDia1 is involved in formation of membrane ruffles We found that endogenous mDia1 localized in epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - induced ruffles and is the formin protein that shows the highest expression in HeLa cells ( Fig . S1A , B , and see below ) . On this ground , we decided to study the contribution of mDia1 to the formation of lamellipodia and ruffles . We used two different DIAPH1 - targeting short hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) to generate stable mDia1 - knockdown HeLa cells : hairpin # 1 and # 2 reduced mDia1 protein levels by 89±4 % and 94±2 % ( mean±s . d . ; n = 3 ) , respectively , without affecting the expression of EGFR , mDia2 , the WAVE complex subunits WAVE2 , WAVE1 , Nap1 and Pir121 , and the Arp2 / 3 - complex subunits ARPC2 and ARPC3 ( Fig . 1A ) . Likewise , morphology of control and mDia1 - knockdown cells at the steady state was essentially identical ( data not shown ) . Although control and mDia1 - knockdown HeLa cells attained similar Rho and Rac1 activities both in resting conditions and upon EGF stimulation ( Fig . 1B , C ) , the cells depleted of mDia1 did not ruffle upon EGF addition and formed filopodium - like protrusions ( Fig . 1D , E ; Table S1 ) . This response is remarkably similar to that of Nap1 - knockdown cells , which retain only residual WAVE complex levels , and Arp2 / 3 - complex - knockdown cells ( Beli et al . , 2008 ) . Time - lapse video microscopy showed that the actin - rich , ruffle - like and filopodia - like structures observed in control and mDia1 - knockdown HeLa cells are dynamic protrusions of the plasma membrane that grow by extension ( Fig . 1F ; Movies 1 , 2 ) . Established markers of lamellipodia and ruffles ( ARPC2 and WAVE2 ) and filopodia ( fascin ) confirmed that EGF triggers the formation of genuine ruffles and filopodia in control and mDia1 - knockdown cells , respectively ( Fig . S1C , D ) . Thus , the suggested role of mDia1 in the making of filopodia ( Goh et al . , 2011 ) is either non - essential or cell - type specific . In addition , mDia1 downregulation impaired membrane ruffling in MDA - MB - 231 ( Fig . S2A – C ) and COS - 7 cells ( Fig . S2D – F ) , thereby supporting the generality of the function of mDia1 . mDia1 is an EGF - regulated actin nucleator controlling membrane ruffling We rescued mDia1 - knockdown cells with mouse mDia1 , which is highly similar to DIAPH1 but refractory to the DIAPH1 - targeting hairpins . The cells re - expressing wild - type mDia1 showed a significant increase in EGF - induced ruffling ( Fig . 2A , B ; Table S2 ) . Importantly , we ruled out that mouse mDia1 could also exert similar effects on cells that express DIAPH1 ( Table S3 and data not shown ) . Several lines of evidence collectively support the specificity of the function of mDia1 in ruffle formation : ( 1 ) HeLa and MDA - MB - 231 cells ruffle independently of mDia2 ( Beli et al . , 2008 ; and data not shown , respectively ) , ( 2 ) HeLa cells lack mDia3 ( Isogai et al . , 2015a , b ; Fig . S1B ) , ( 3 ) RNA interference ( RNAi ) - mediated knockdown of mDia3 in COS - 7 cells did not exert any effect on ruffling ( Fig . S2D – F ) , and ( 4 ) overexpression of neither mDia2 nor profilin - 1 rescued EGF - induced ruffling in the mDia1 - knockdown cells , nor did it alter the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in the control cells ( Fig . S3A – C , Table S4 ) . Of note , the fact that profilin - 1 had no noticeable effects in the control cells also ruled out that the downregulation of mDia1 simply perturbs the distribution of actin monomers between the lamellipodium - or ruffle - and the filopodium - making machineries ( Rotty et al . , 2015 ; Suarez et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , the observation that mDia1 mutants lacking either the FH2 domain ( mDia1 Δ FH2 ) or the ability to bind activated Rho ( mDia1 V160D ) ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) did not significantly rescue the mDia1 - knockdown cells suggests that mDia1 functions as an EGF - activated actin - regulatory protein controlling membrane ruffling ( Fig . S3D – F , Table S5 ) . To further strengthen this point , we first compared free barbed ends present in control and mDia1 - knockdown cells prior to and after EGF addition . In resting conditions , both cell lines showed a similar distribution and overall level of free barbed ends ( Fig . 2C , D ) . Stimulation of the control cells with EGF caused a rapid increase in the free barbed ends ( Fig . 2C , E , G ) . This effect was particularly evident close to the supra - basal regions of the plasma membrane , which are prospective sites of ruffle formation ( Fig . 2C ) . In keeping with the notion that EGF signaling regulates the activity of mDia1 , no significant increase in the free barbed ends could be measured in mDia1 - knockdown cells after EGF stimulation ( Fig . 2D , F , G ) . Nevertheless , stress fibers located close to the basal membrane were similar in both cell lines , thus suggesting that mDia1 and other formins act redundantly in regulating these actin - based structures . Importantly , supra - basal barbed - end formation near the plasma membrane correlated with the enrichment of endogenous mDia1 in both nascent and expanding ruffles ( Fig . 3 ) . As overexpression of the anti - capping protein Mena ( Bear and Gertler , 2009 ) did not rescue EGF - induced ruffling in the mDia1 - knockdown cells ( Fig . S3G , H , Table S6 ) , the contribution of mDia1 to membrane ruffling goes beyond actin - filament elongation and likely involves actin nucleation . mDia1 polymerizes linear actin filaments activating the Arp2 / 3 complex To test directly the above hypothesis , we purified recombinant wild - type full - length mDia1 and a mutant thereof ( M1182A , hereafter MA ) that should be constitutively active because the M - to - A mutation prevents the auto - inhibitory DID – DAD interaction without affecting actin nucleation ( Alberts , 2001 ; Gould et al . , 2011 ) ( Fig . 4A ) . We carried out total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFm ) - based in vitro actin polymerization assays in the presence of profilin , which binds monomeric actin , reducing spontaneous nucleation and filament assembly in vitro ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) . Actin - bound profilin also unmasks actin nucleation and enhances filament elongation by mDia1 deletion mutants ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) . In line with the mDia1 auto - inhibition model , wild - type mDia1 did not affect either nucleation or elongation of actin filaments ( Fig . 4B , E ; Movie 3 ) and could be activated by GTP γ S - bound RhoA ( data not shown ) . By contrast , mDia1 MA markedly increased filament nucleation and also accelerated filament elongation ( Fig . 4C – E ; Fig . S3I , Movie 4 ) . Taken together , these data indicate that full - length mDia1 is an auto - inhibited actin nucleator that controls also actin filament elongation , as previously suggested by mDia1 deletion mutants ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) and quasi full - length mDia1 ( Maiti et al . , 2012 ) . 3797 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 3796 - 3810 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 176768 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e Fig . 1 . mDia1 is required for EGF - induced membrane ruffling .

As expected , the Arp2 / 3 complex could nucleate branched actin filament arrays only upon activation by WAVE2 ( Fig . S3J – L ) . However , actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex was severely limitedbythe scarcityofmotheractin filaments becausespontaneous self - assemblyrelies onfree G - actin escapingthe controlofprofilin - 1 . In agreement with the fact that mDia1 does not bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( ( Beli et al . , 2008 , and data not shown ) , mDia1 MA was unable to functionally replace WAVE2 ( Fig . S3M ) . However , concomitant addition of mDia1 MA and WAVE2 reduced the lag time of initiation and increased the number of these arrays , thereby revealing that these two proteins synergize in activating the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4F , G ; Movie 5 ) . Instead , auto - inhibited wild - type Fig . 2 . See next page for legend . 3799 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 3796 - 3810 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 176768 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e mDia1 had minor effects only at very high concentration ( Fig . 4G ) . These results suggest that mDia1 nucleates linearactin filamentsthat , in combination with the NPF activity of WAVE2 , are required for efficient nucleation of branched actin filaments by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Moreover , the dose - dependent effects of mDia1 ( Fig . 4F , G ) agree with the formation of mother filaments being a rate - limiting step in Arp2 / 3 complex activation . mDia1 regulates initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles To gain insight into how mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex collaborate in the making of ruffles , we used ground state depletion ( GSD ) super - resolution microscopy ( SRm ) to map the position of endogenous WAVE2 and mDia1 within EGF - induced ruffles : when WAVE2 was enriched at the protruding front ( Fig . 5A , C ) , mDia1 mainly populated the region behind the tip ( Fig . 5B , C ) . The localization of WAVE2 at or close to the tip of lamellipodia and ruffles agrees with its ability to stimulate Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin polymerization and ensuing membrane protrusion . The localization of mDia1 suggests that this formin might contribute to the initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles , and be dispensable for their subsequent growth and protrusion , an autocatalytic process driven by the Arp2 / 3 complex . If so , mDia1 might play only an ancillary role at the tip of expanding lamellipodia and ruffles . To assess whether mDia1 is dispensable for the expansion of lamellipodia and ruffles after the initiation phase , we fused full - length mDia1 to SuperNova , a derivative of KillerRed that facilitates chromophore - assisted light inactivation ( CALI ) ( Sano et al . , 2014 ; Takemoto et al . , 2013 ) . First , we showed that SuperNova – mDia1 rescues ruffle formation in the mDia1 - knockdown cells , almost as efficiently as Flag - tagged mDia1 ( Fig . S4A , B , Table S7 ) . Then , we verified the effectiveness of CALI and found that intense illumination of SuperNova – mDia1 - expressing cells prior to EGF stimulation significantly reduced lamellipodia and ruffle formation compared to neighboring non - treated SuperNova – mDia1 - expressing cells ( Fig . 5D ; Movie 6 , Table S8 ) . Finally , we exploited this optogenetic tool to gain spatiotemporal control of the mDia1 activity . Because we found that inactivation of SuperNova – mDia1 in the mDia1 - knockdown cells that ruffled upon EGF stimulation did not arrest ruffling ( Fig . 5E ; Movie 7 , Table S8 ) , it appears that mDia1 is required only for initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles . mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex cooperate in the making of ruffles The observed synergy between mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex in the initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles implies that hyperactivation of either protein should compensate for the knockdown and ensuing decreased activity of the other one and rescue , at least partially , ruffling . In order to test this possibility , we exploited the fact that knockdowns retain low levels of the downregulated protein ( i . e . they are equivalent to hypomorphic mutants ) to carry out functional complementation assays in which we manipulated the NPF activity of the WAVE complex and the abundance of mother filaments , the two Arp2 / 3 complex co - activators ( Fig . 6A ) . To forcefully augment the activity of the WAVE complex , we overexpressed constitutively active Rac1 ( Rac1 Q61L ) in control , mDia1 - and Nap1 - knockdown cells . Rac1 Q61L readily induced dorsal ruffles in control knockdown HeLa cells ( Fig . 6B , C ) , as previously reported ( Innocenti et al . , 2004 ) . Most importantly , Rac1 Q61L efficiently rescued mDia1 - knockdown cells , although ruffling was slightly reduced compared to the control cells ( Fig . 6B , C ) . This observation suggests that the action of mDia1 might extend beyond the initiation phase of lamellipodium and ruffle formation , and agrees with mDia1 localizing within these actin - based protrusions . By contrast , Nap1 - knockdown cells did not ruffle upon either EGF stimulation ( Beli et al . , 2008 ; Innocenti et al . , 2005 ) or Rac1 Q61L overexpression ( Fig . 6B , C ) , further underlining that the WAVE complex is the main NPF acting downstream of Rac1 . However , it remains possible that Rac1 Q61L activates the Arp2 / 3 complex through WAVE - complex - dependent pathways that are either independent of or inhibited by mDia1 . To increase the mother filaments available for Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization , we overexpressed mDia1 in Nap1 - knockdown cells and partially rescued EGF - induced ruffling ( Fig . 6D , E ; Table S9 ) . As ( 1 ) constitutively active Rac induced membrane ruffling and concomitant activation of endogenous Rho ( Fig . 6B , C and data not shown , respectively ) , whereas ( 2 ) constitutively active Rho ( Fig . S4C , D and Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) and ( 3 ) activated mDia1 - deletion mutants were insufficient to trigger ruffle formation ( Watanabe et al . , 1999 and data not shown ) , the sum of these experiments shows that mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex cooperate in the making of ruffles and do not act independently of each other . mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex cooperate in promoting ruffling and regulate cell motility Ubiquitous expression of mDia1 andtheWAVEcomplex suggeststhat the protein levels and activities of mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex determine the impact of either nucleator on membrane ruffling . Consistent with this hypothesis , ( 1 ) WAVE2 attained a higher expression in COS - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells than HeLa cells ( Fig . 7A ) and ( 2 ) mDia1 was requiredfor MDA - MB - 231 cellsto ruffle upon reduction of Arp2 / 3 complex activity by the small molecule CK666 ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig . 7B , C ) . In keeping with the idea that cooperation between mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex mediates EGF - induced membrane ruffling ( Fig . 1D , E ; Fig . S3 and Fig . 7B , C ) and the crucial role of lamellipodia and ruffles in mesenchymal cell migration Fig . 2 . mDia1 is required for formation of free barbed ends upon EGF stimulation .

Of note , concomitant decrease of mDia1 expression and Arp2 / 3 complex activity had additional negative effects onthe migratoryabilities of MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 7D ) . This observation is consistent with the Arp2 / 3 complex having also mDia1 - independent functions that , together with membrane protrusions , allow for optimal cell migration . As cell directionality was not affected by any of these perturbations ( Fig . 7E ) , these results collectively suggest that mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex specifically support actin - based protrusion of the plasma membrane for cell motility .

At the mechanistic level , we demonstrate that mDia1 polymerizes linear actin filaments allowing the Arp2 / 3 complex to set in motion auto - catalytic assembly of branched actin filaments . These findings highlight that the lamellipodium - and ruffle - initiating machinery consists of two actin nucleators that act sequentially . On this ground , we propose that both the WAVE complex and the polymerization of mother actin filaments undergo regulation within nascent lamellipodia and ruffles . As mDia1 did not bind either the WAVE complex or the Arp2 / 3 complex , our data are consistent with a model in which EGFR activation recruits and activates mDia1 at the plasma membrane through Rho , thereby leading to the formation of new linear actin filaments ( Fig . 8 ) . Rac - induced activation of the WAVE complex at the plasma membrane cooperates with the actin filaments generated by mDia1 in promoting initial activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . After the initiation phase , auto - catalytic nucleation of branched actin filaments by the Arp2 / 3 complex is sufficient to support the expansion of lamellipodia and ruffles ( Fig . 8 ) . The mechanism regulating the initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles fills a huge gap in our understanding of these actin - based protrusions , as explained below . Pioneering biochemical and molecular genetic studies discovered that pre - existing mother actin filaments and the NPF WAVE are required for activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , ensuing nucleation of branched actin filaments and formation of lamellipodia and ruffles . As filamentous actin is an essential cofactor in the Arp2 / 3 - complex activation mechanism , actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex is an auto - catalytic reaction using newly assembled branched actin filaments as a template for further rounds of branching ( Beli et al . , 2008 ; Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Le Clainche and Carlier , 2008 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Rotty et al . , 2013 ; Suraneni et al . , 2012 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ) . Although these seminal studies have illuminated the mechanism that sustains expansion of lamellipodia and ruffles , the initiation thereof has remained so far enigmatic because the origin and availability of the pre - existing actin filaments mediating initial activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex were mysterious . In fact , both aged and tropomyosin - bound actin filaments serve as very poor mother filaments for the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 , 2001 ; Bugyi and Carlier , 2010 ; DesMarais et al . , 2002 ; Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ) . Furthermore , the actin cortex is enriched in myosins and other actin - binding proteins that prevent binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex to actin filaments ( Biro et al . , 2013 ) . Conversely , de novo polymerized actin filaments can be efficiently used as mother filaments by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ; Bugyi and Carlier , 2010 ) . Thus , the initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles raises the paradox that for the Arp2 / 3 complex to make branched actin filaments it requires prior polymerization of new actin filaments . Two possible solutions to this paradox have been proposed : ( 1 ) cofilin - mediated severing might create free barbed ends and polymerizing actin filaments that can activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) , and ( 2 ) SPIN90 ( also known as NCKIPSD ) - mediated activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex without pre - existing actin filaments ( Wagner et al . , 2013 ) . However , neither mechanism seems to be satisfactory as knockdown and CALI of cofilin results in enlargement of lamellipodia and ruffles and increased F - actin levels in cells employing the mesenchymal mode of migration ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ; Sidani et al . , 2007 ; Vitriol et al . , 2013 ) , and full - length SPIN90 does not activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fukuoka et al . , 2001 and data not shown ) . In this regard , the involvement of another actin nucleator in the mechanism regulating initial activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex would resolve this paradox . The ability of mDia1 to polymerize linear actin filaments for the Arp2 / 3 complex solves the mystery of the pre - existing mother filaments thereby unveiling the mechanism regulating the initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles . Remarkably , this mechanism also provides an explanation for the puzzling and neglected observations that dendritic and T cells obtained from mDia1 - knockout mice cannot form lamellipodia or ruffles , and exhibit defective cell motility ( Sakata et al . , 2007 ; Tanizaki et al . , 2010 ) .

PM , plasma membrane ; thick black arrows indicate protrusion . 3806 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 3796 - 3810 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 176768 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e Our findings reinforce the notion that formin family proteins are tightly intertwined with the biogenesis of lamellipodia and ruffles . Interestingly , it appears that different formins regulate specific phases of the life cycle of lamellipodia and ruffles : we show that mDia1 exerts a unique role in the initiation phase , whereas FMNL2 , mDia2 , mDia1 and other formins might have partially redundant roles during the expansion phase ( Block et al . , 2012 ; Gupton et al . , 2007 ) . Remarkably , the role of mDia1 in initiating Arp2 / 3 - complex - dependent actin polymerization might extend beyond the protrusion of lamellipodia and ruffles , and cell migration . In fact , recent indirect evidence suggests that mDia1 might act upstream of the Arp2 / 3 complex in nucleating cortical actin during mitosis ( Bovellan et al . , 2014 ) . However , the cooperation between mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex in the assembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton is cell cycle dependent , as interphase cells have a cortex composed of independent mDia1 - and Arp2 / 3 - complex - nucleated actin networks ( Bovellan et al . , 2014 ) . As NPFs and mother filaments are obligatory cofactors of the Arp2 / 3 complex , we speculate that cooperation between dedicated NPFs , and actin nucleators producing mother filaments might be a general mechanism to control the execution of Arp2 / 3 - complex - dependent processes at specific locations within the cell ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Rotty et al . , 2013 ) . In conclusion , the cooperation between mDia1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex in the making of lamellipodia and ruffles enables cells to sense and integrate different signals regulating membrane protrusion and mesenchymal cell migration . Given that lamellipodia and ruffles are key to a variety of developmental and homeostatic processes linked to a growing number of diseases , including cancer ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Machesky , 2008 ) , the mechanism regulating the initiation of lamellipodia and ruffles has a paramount importance in both biology and medicine .

Fixed samples were treated with freshly prepared 0 . 1 % NaBH 4 in PBS for 7 min . Samples were extensively washed with PBS and blocked with 5 % BSA for 30 min at room temperature , stained with the primary antibodies followed by the secondary antibodies and phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) . Imaging was carried out on a Leica SR - GSD microscope . Images were taken in EPI mode at 100 frames per second and 10 , 000 – 15 , 000 frames were collected ( total measurement time of ∼ 5 min ) . Images were taken sequentially in decreasing excitation and emission wavelength order in the presence of an oxygen scavenging system [ 10 % glucose , 0 . 5 mg / ml glucose oxidase , 40 µg / ml catalase and 50 mM cysteamine ( MEA ) ] . Measurement of protein enrichment at the cell edge HeLa cells seeded on gelatin - coated coverslips were transfected with EGFP and serum starved overnight . Cells were either left untreated or stimulated with EGF ( 100 ng ml − 1 ) for the indicated time . Cells were fixed , stained and imaged as above . The relative abundance of EGFP and mDia1 at the edges were assessed by calculating the relative intensity of either protein at the cell edge over the mean intensity in the cytoplasm ( ratio ; arbitrary units ) . EGFP served as a volumetric marker and relative enrichment of mDia1 at the cell edge was determined by normalizing against EGFP ( normalized relative intensity ; arbitrary units ) . Ratiometric measurement of Rho GTPase activities by fluorescence resonance energy transfer Cells were seeded on gelatin - coated coverslips , and transiently transfected with Rac1 or RhoA fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - based biosensors [ dimerization - optimized reporters for activation of Rho GTPases ‘ DORA , ’ which are an improved version of Raichu ( Itoh et al . , 2002 ) and RhoA sensors ( Pertz et al . , 2006 ) ] . Cells were serum starved overnight prior to the experiment . Experiments were performed in DMEM - F12 medium without Phenol Red ( Invitrogen ) , in a humidified chamber with 5 % CO 2 at 37°C . Images were taken on a Leica TCSSP5 confocal equipped with an oil - immersion HCX PL APO CS 63 . 0× ( NA 1 . 40 ) ‘ Lambda - Blue ’ objective and LAS - AF acquisition software extended with MatrixScreener ( Leica Microsystems ) . Fluorophores were excited with 458 nm laser light and two images ( emission range from 465 – 510 nm and 520 – 600 nm ) were acquired simultaneously . The laser power was set at a level that prevented fluorophore saturation , and neither photobleaching nor phototoxic effects were observed . Four fields of view were followed within a single experiment with a time lapse of 20 – 25 s between individual images [ data were linearly interpolated ( SciPy , Oliphant 2007 ) to 25 - s intervals ] . Rho GTPase activity is presented as a ratio between YFPand CFP channels , set at 1 at the onset of the experiment . Quantification of the distribution of WAVE2 and mDia1 within EGF - induced protrusions Ruffles and lamellipodia were segmented in three equal areas denoted as front , middle and rear , with the front area being the distal part relative to the cell body . Knowing the physical size of a pixel , the total area ( μ m 2 ) of both the entire protrusion and each segment thereof were obtained from phalloidin images . WAVE2 or mDia1 - positive particles in the total area ( or in each segment ) were quantified with ImageJ using the ‘ Analyze particles ’ function after supervised segmentation . The distribution of WAVE2 and mDia1 was then calculated as number of particles in a given segment divided over the total number of particles within the entire protrusion ( expressed as a percentage ) . For the quantification of particles at the ruffle and lamellipodium tip , the area and particle count were restricted to 5 pixels width ( 0 . 1 µm ) from the edge , as determined using phalloidin staining . WAVE2 - or mDia1 - positive particles at the tip and in the remaining part of the protrusion were quantified with the ImageJ using the ‘ Analyze particles ’ function after supervised segmentation . The relative density of WAVE2 and mDia1 at the tip ( expressed as percentage ) was calculated as number of particles at the tip divided over the total number of particles within the entire protrusion . The relative abundance of WAVE2 and mDia1 at the tip ( expressed as a ratio ; arbitrary units ) was calculated by dividing the density of WAVE2 or mDia1 at the tips ( particles / µm 2 ) over the average density of WAVE2 or mDia1 ( particles / µm 2 ) within the entire protrusion . Classification of EGF - induced protrusions Ruffles and filopodia were classified as previously described ( Beli et al . , 2008 ) . Cellular protrusions were scored manually and grouped in following three categories : ( 1 ) ruffles and lamellipodia when filopodia were absent , ( 2 ) filopodiawhen ruffles and lamellipodia were absent , ( 3 ) both when these different actin - based protrusions coexisted in the same cell , and ( 4 ) none when protrusions were absent . The origin of the protrusive organelles was verified using bona fide molecular markers of lamellipodia , ruffles and filopodia ( Fig . S1 ) . At least 50 – 100 cells were counted per condition per experiment and data are shown as mean±s . e . m . from three independent experiments unless otherwise indicated . TIRFm - based actin polymerization assays Glass coverslips ( 24×50 mm , # 1 . 5 ) were washed for 30 min in acetone , 10 min in absolute ethanol , rinsed in double - distilled water ( ddH 2 O ) , and cleaned for 2 h in 2 % Helmanex . Cleaned coverslips were rinsed extensively with ddH 2 O , and dried with compressed air flow . Coverslips were derivatized by coating with 1 mg / ml mPEG - silane MW 5000 ( Laysan Bio , Arab , AL ) in 96 % ethanol for 18 h at room temperature with gentle shaking . Next , coverslips were rinsed extensively with absolute ethanol and ddH 2 O , dried using a compressed air flow and stored for up to 1 week . Flow cells were assembled by placing four parallel strips of double - sided tape ( 15 mm×2 mm×70 μ m ) onto a cleaned glass slide ( 25×75 mm ) with ∼ 15 mm spacing between the strips . A polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) - coated coverslip was then positioned over the strips to obtain three separate flow chambers . TIRFm was performed using a Leica DMI600B inverted microscope ( Leica Microsystems GmbH , Germany ) equipped with a Multi - Color laserbox with four diode lasers ( 405 , 488 , 561 and 635 nm ) and AOTF control , a PLAN APO 63× / 1 . 47 Oil HCX TIRF objective , and an air - cooled Hamamatsu 9100 - 02 EMCCD High Speed camera with a pixel size of 8 μ m 2 . Focus was maintained by the built - in adaptive focus control ( AFC ) unit . Actin polymerization was carried out in TIRF buffer [ 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 6 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 15 mM glucose , 20 μ g / ml catalase , 100 μ g / ml glucose oxidase , 1 % BSA and 0 . 5 % methylcellulose ( 4000 cP ) ] . Actin regulatory proteins were diluted into TIRF buffer , then rapidly mixed with G - actin ( 20 % Atto488 - labeled G - actin ) and introduced into the flow cell . The time between initial mixing and the start of TIRFm recording was typically 15 – 20 s . Images were acquired every 3 s . Final protein concentrations were as follows : 2 . 5 µM actin , 5 µM profilin - 1 , 25 nM WAVE2 and 20 nM of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Concentrations of mDia1 are depicted in the figures . The final amount of glycerol never exceeded 1 % . Single filaments were manually tracked in ImageJ . Elongation rate ( subunits / s ) was calculated considering that 1 μ m of F - actin corresponds to 370 monomers . All experiments are representative of at least two independent protein preparations assayed with similar outcome . Filament area was determined using the ImageJ plugin ‘ Area Calculator ’ . Lines in the graphs represent connected points . Migration assays Approximately 15 , 000 – 18 , 000 control knockdown and mDia1 - knockdown MDA - MB - 231 cellswere plated oncollagen - coated µ - Slide Chemotaxisunits and serum starved overnight . Cells were then incubated with CK666 ( 50 µM ) or control DMSO for 45 – 60 min while a gradient of EGF was forming ( final concentration of 25 ng ml − 1 ) . Next , cells were imaged every 2 min on a Zeiss Axio ObserverZ1 microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a LDPlan - Neofluar Ph2 20× ( NA 0 . 40 ) objective , operated with Zeiss Microscope Software ZEN 2012 . Individual cells were tracked using the ‘ Manual Tracking ’ plugin for ImageJ . Average total cell movement and directionality were computed using the ‘ Chemotaxis Tool ’ plugin for ImageJ ( www . ibidi . com ) . At least 40 cells per condition were tracked in two independent experiments . 3808 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 3796 - 3810 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 176768 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e Total RNA isolation and qRT - PCR analyses Total RNA and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) were obtained as previously described ( Isogai et al . , 2015a , b ) . Quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) reactions were set up using 5 – 10 ng of cDNA as a template and gene - specific primers ( 200 nM , Isogai et al . , 2015b ) in a StepOnePlus Real - Time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) . All reactions produced single amplicons ( 100 – 200 bps ) , which allowed us to equate one threshold cycle difference . Results were normalized with respect to GAPDH expression . mRNA levels were quantified according to the 2 − ΔΔ Ct method ( Ct , cycle threshold ) . Genes with Ct values of ≥ 31 were considered as not expressed . Statistics Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6 . 01 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA , USA , www . graphpad . com ) . In all cases : * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ; * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . Acknowledgements WethankJ . Collard , W . MoolenaarandT . Nagaiforreagents , L . OmenandL .
