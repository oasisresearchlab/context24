This review focuses on the role of the protein kinase C ( PKC ) family in podocytes and points out the differential roles of classical , novel , and atypical PKCs in podocytes . Some PKC isoforms are indispensable for proper glomerular development and slit diaphragm mainte - nance , whereas others might be harmful when activated in the diabetic milieu . Therefore , some might be interesting treatment targets in the early phase of diabetes . Keywords : proteinuria , diabetic podocytopathy , glomerulosclerosis , nephrin endocytosis , effacement INTRODUCTION Diabetic nephropathy ( DN ) is the most common cause of the end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ( 1 ) . The glomerular changes in DN are characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) with thickening of glomerular and tubular basement membranes and mesangial expansion , which ultimately progress primarily to glomerulosclerosis and secondarily to tubulointersti - tial ﬁbrosis . The various cell types involved include glomerular endothelial cells , mesangial cells , podocytes , and tubular epithelia , which are all targets of hyperglycemic injury . However , accumulat - ingevidencesuggeststhattheextentof injuryandlossof podocytes is a major prognostic determinant in both , type I and type II DN ( 2 – 6 ) . As the terminally differentiated podocytes are believed to play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular ﬁltration barrier , effaced podocytes may contribute to the devel - opment of albuminuria , a hallmark of DN . Although primarily structure proteins were thought to be the key elements that com - pose the slit diaphragm initially , it has become clear that the slit diaphragm protein complex is a highly dynamic functional pro - tein complex and is able to initiate cascades of signaling pathways that affect podocyte function ( 7 ) . More recent data indicate that podocytes express receptors for many circulating hormones and growth factors , which also suggest that a more complex cross - talk between the kidney and other organs affected by diabetes may occur in health and disease ( 8 ) . Among various signaling kinases , the protein kinase C ( PKC ) family seems to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of DN ( 9 ) . The activation of PKCs in the kidney is a well - known pathway of the diabetic milieu . The PKC family is involved in a variety of signal transduction pathways , cell proliferation , differentiation , cell cycle , and apoptosis . However , the role of PKCs on podocytes in DN has not yet been fully deﬁned . This present review will give an overview of the general role of PKCs and summarize the recentresearchintotheregulatoryroleof PKCsinpodocytesunder diabetic conditions . PKC SUBFAMILIES AND ISOFORMS All PKC isoforms contain a highly conserved catalytic domain and a regulatory domain . The catalytic domain consists of several motifs and is essential for the ATP / substrate - binding and catalysis , whereas the N - terminal regulatory domain con - tains an auto inhibitory pseudo - substrate domain and two dis - crete membrane targeting modules , C1 and C2 . The sequence of pseudo - substrate contains an alanine in place of the ser - ine / threonine phospho - acceptor site , but otherwise resembles a PKC substrate ( 10 ) . Protein kinase C isoforms are subdivided into three subfam - ilies based on differences of structure in their N - terminal regu - latory domain . The isoforms α , β I , β II , and γ belong to conven - tional PKCs ( cPKCs ) . The regulatory domains of cPKCs contain a C1 domain that functions as diacylglycerol ( DAG ) / phorbol 12 - myristat 13 - acetat ( PMA ) binding motif and a C2 domain that binds anionic phospholipids in a calcium - dependent man - ner ( 10 ) . The novel PKCs ( nPKCs δ , ε , η , and θ ) also have two C1 domains and a C2 domain . The nPKC C2 domains lack the critical calcium - coordinating acidic residues , which is the distinct difference between cPKC and nPKC . The nPKCs can be maxi - mally activated by agonists that promote DAG accumulation or by PMA , but they are insensitive to calcium . Atypical PKCs ( aPKCs , ζ , and λ / ι ) lack a calcium - sensitive C2 domain ; however , they con - tain an atypical C1 domain , which binds PIP3 or ceramide , but not DAG or PMA . The activity of aPKCs is primarily regulated by protein – protein interaction and phosphorylation catalyzed by phosphoinositide - dependent kinase - 1 ( PDK - 1 ) . Although a few PKC isoforms are expressed in a tissue - speciﬁc manner , most are ubiquitously expressed . www . frontiersin . org November 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 179 | 1 Teng et al . PKC in diabetic glomerulopathy REGULATION OF PKCs Unless it is post - translationally or co - translationally phosphory - lated , PKCs are incapable of being activated by DAG or other cofactors ( 11 , 12 ) . PKC is translated as a catalytically inactive pro - tein , is converted into an active enzyme by an initial phosphate addition and then into a mature form by further phosphorylation ( 11 , 13 , 14 ) . In addition to phosphorylation on serine and thre - onine residues , PKCs also undergo phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases . PKCs are regulated by two sequential and equally critical mechanisms : phosphorylation triggered by PDK - 1 and binding to DAG and / or other cofactors such as phosphatidylserine ( PS ) or phorbol ester ( PE ) . Each mechanism regulates the structure , subcellular localization , and function of PKCs ( 15 ) . As a consequence of increased glycolytic ﬂux , chronic hyper - glycemia elevates the de novo synthesis of DAG and thus leads to an increased activation of DAG dependent classic and novel PKC iso - forms in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells and smooth mus - cle cells ( 16 ) . Furthermore , high - glucose induced cellular levels leadtoanincreasedgenerationof advancedglycationendproducts ( AGEs ) , which initiate several signaling events by activating PKC , MAP kinase , and transcription factors such as nuclear factor - κ B ( NF - κ B ) . This would increase the activity of various growth fac - tors , such as TGF - β , and thereby alter expression of ECM proteins ( 17 ) . In addition , under high - glucose conditions PKC is activated by higher concentrations of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) gener - ated following AGE : RAGE ( AGE receptor ) interactions ( 15 , 18 ) . In turn , the ROS are generated via NADPH - oxidase activated by PKC , ROS / PKC therefore can act in a cyclical manner to activate one another ( 19 ) . CONVENTIONAL PKCs IN DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY Among all the PKC isoforms , the role of PKC α in the pathogenesis of DN has been investigated intensively , and several studies have demonstrated that PKC α - deﬁcient mice show a better outcome after streptozotocin ( STZ ) induced diabetes with less proteinuria and preserved nephrin expression ( 20 , 21 ) . Studies from our group underline the involvement of PKC α in proteinuria development in DN . The expression of PKC α in podocytes of patients with DN was increased . Mice were treated after STZ - induced diabetes with the synthetic PKC α inhibitor ( GÖ6976 ) , which prevented pro - teinuria development and led to preserved nephrin expression . Furthermore , we could show a central role for PKC α in endocy - tosis of the slit diaphragm component nephrin ( 22 , 23 ) . Quack et al . further concluded that proteinuria of diabetic mice is as a result of increased endocytosis of nephrin , which is mediated by a complex consisting of PKC α , protein interacting with c kinase - 1 ( PICK1 ) , and beta - arrestin2 . They found rising glucose levels go along with increased binding of beta - arrestin to nephrin in vitro as well as in in vivo , but only with preceding PKC α phosphory - lating activity on nephrin . This fact and the indispensability of PICK1 suggest PKC α and PICK1 as possible drug targets in early stages of DN ( 23 ) . These studies show that expression of PKC α is regulated by glucose concentration in the external milieu of the podocyte and that PKC α is directly involved in the mainte - nance of the slit diaphragm . High levels of PKC α in podocytes led to enhanced endocytosis of nephrin and instability of the slit diaphragm . In addition , Menne and colleagues demonstrated that the high - glucose induced downregulation of nephrin is probably caused by the PKC α mediated reduction of the transcriptional factor Wilms tumor 1 ( WT - 1 ) , which has previously been described as a directly interacting binding partner of the nephrin promoter ( 24 , 25 ) . These ﬁndings are consistent with earlier studies , suggesting one of the PKC isoforms might be pivotal for the regulation of nephrin transcription and expression in podocytes ( 26 ) , but not for CD2AP and Podocin as they remain at levels similar to those in non - diabetic kidneys ( 27 ) . Langham et al . showed that in diabetic patients treated with perindopril , an ACE inhibitor , nephrin levels preserved resem - bling those of non - diabetic subjects ( 28 ) and subsequently could be one factor contributing to the anti - proteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors . Another study suggests that the AGEs , which can be inhibited by aminoguanidine , are also implicated in the downreg - ulation of nephrin in diabetes ( 29 ) . Interestingly , several groups could demonstrate the reduction of PKC activity under the treat - mentwithACEinhibitorsandaminoguanidineindiabeticsubjects that could explain the nephrin protective effects ( 30 , 31 ) . Most previous studies with speciﬁc PKC β inhibitor ruboxistau - rin ( LX333531 ) in vivo and in vitro indicated that PKC β isoform is primarily responsible for the high - glucose - induced renal effects in diabetes ( 32 – 36 ) . Meier et al . tested this hypothesis by inducing DN in PKC β deﬁcient mice and did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant pre - ventive effect of PKC β deﬁciency on albuminuria . In contrast to non - albuminuric diabetic PKC α − / − mice , the loss of the basement membraneproteoglycanperlecanandthepodocyteslitdiaphragmproteinnephrinwerenotpreventedinthePKC β − / − mice under diabetic conditions ( 20 , 37 ) . However , the hyperglycemia - induced renal and glomerular hypertrophy as well as increased expression of ECM proteins was reduced in PKC β deﬁciency diabetic mice . In summary , the two important physiological features of DN , renal hypertrophy and albuminuria , are regulated through differ - ent PKC isoforms ; PKC α is involved in the development of albu - minuria and maintenance the glomerular ﬁltration barrier struc - ture , whereas the PKC β - isoform contributes to hyperglycemia - induced renal ﬁbrosis . Another study by Menne et al . combined the ﬁndings about PKC α and PKC β and demonstrated that a dual inhibition of both isoforms has a synergistic effect and is capable of preventing the development of experimental DN in streptozocin - induced dia - betic mice ( 38 ) . Blocking both isoforms has a beneﬁcial effect on the development of renal hypertrophy and albuminuria in mice after 8 weeks of diabetes . A pharmacological approach with CGP41252 , an inhibitor of PKC α and PKC β showed that the occurrence of albuminuria could be avoided and preexisting albu - minuria could be diminished in both type I and type II diabetic mice ( 38 ) . But the treatment had little impact on the develop - ment of renal hypertrophy . Higher doses treatment also increased mortality . ESSENTIAL ROLE OF NOVEL AND ATYPICAL PKCs Only little is known about PKC ε in renal function , especially about its role in podocytes , although several previous studies showed increased expression and activation of PKC ε isoform in experi - mental DN ( 39 , 40 ) . Meier et al . investigated the functional role of Frontiers in Endocrinology | Diabetes November 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 179 | 2 Teng et al . PKC in diabetic glomerulopathy PKC ε in renal physiology using PKC ε - knockout mice and found a renal phenotype with an elevated occurrence of tubulointersti - tial ﬁbrosis and glomerulosclerosis , whereas a systemic proﬁbrotic phenotype was not observed ( 41 ) . Moreover , they demonstrated an increased level of albuminuria in knockout mice whereas the kidney / body ratio remained normal in comparison to non - diabetic wild type mice , indicating that PKC ε is probably less implicated in development of renal hypertrophy . Experiments on diabetic mice further showed that knockout of PKC ε can exac - erbate the renal phenotype with a signiﬁcantly increased urinary albumin / creatinine ratio and expression of ECM proteins . These data suggest that a rising level of PKC ε has a protective function in kidney injury , rather than inducing proﬁbrotic changes . The atypical isoforms PKC λ and PKC ι are both highly expressed in podocytes . Although it is not clear whether both iso - types perform distinct roles in the cell , aPKCs are well - known to be important in the establishment of cell polarity ( 42 , 43 ) . They form an evolutionarily conserved complex consisting of aPKC and PAR3 and PAR6 , two PDZ domain containing scaffold proteins ( 44 ) . Studies showed that the Par3 – Par6 – aPKC complex inter - acts with nephrin – podocin through the direct connection of Par3 to nephrin , an essential structural component for the mainte - nance of integrity of the glomerular ﬁlter as well as for the signal transduction ( 45 ) . Interestingly , our own studies of the glomeru - lar development in regard to the Par polarity complex and slit diaphragm molecules show that the PAR3 – PAR6 – aPKC λ com - plex translocates together with other tight junction proteins like ZO - 1 from the apical to the basolateral side of the cell preceding the targeting of slit diaphragm components such as nephrin and podocin to the basal membrane , development of foot processes , and the construction of slit diaphragms ( 46 ) . The very recent study of Satoh and colleagues shows the neces - sity of aPKC in the exocytosis of newly produced nephrin and its localization on the surface of podocytes ( 47 ) . This ﬁnding could also partially explain the diminished nephrin expression in proteinuriapatientswithdiabetes ( 48 ) . Underhigh - glucosecondi - tions , activationof aPKCpresentsaprotectiveeffectonthenephrin expression ( 48 ) . The activation of aPKC is required for the insulin - induced glu - cose transport and thus defective aPKC activation in muscle and adipocyteshasbeenshownpreviouslyintypeIIdiabeticrats , mon - keys , and human beings , which leads to a disturbed glucose uptake into muscle and the whole body glucose transfer ( 49 ) . The knock - out of the other isoform PKC ζ has no speciﬁc renal phenotype but seems to be able compensate for partial functions of aPKC λ loss as the double - knockout leads to glomerular developmental defects with no secondary foot processes ( 50 ) . This is most likely because of the regulatory cytoskeletal functions of aPKCs with direct inﬂuence on small GTPase activation of aPKCs in podocytes ( 51 ) . Nevertheless , the role of aPKC in DN still remains unclear . PKC UP - REGULATED GROWTH FACTOR EXPRESSION IN DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY Podocytes are the major site of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) production in the human kidney ( 52 ) , and the expres - sion of VEGF is increased in podocytes in diabetic rats and human beings ( 53 , 54 ) . Thus , the up - regulation of VEGF plays a critical role in the progression of DN . Hoshi et al . have shown that under high - glucose conditions , VEGF expression was up - regulated mediated through activation of PKC and extracellu - lar signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) in podocytes ( 55 ) . PKC and ERK are known to regulate activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) activation ( 56 – 58 ) , which promotes the binding of AP - 1 to the promoter region of the VEGF gene ( 59 , 60 ) . In addition , AGEs upregu - late VEGF mRNA levels through transcription factors such as NF - κ B and AP - 1 . AGEs are also able to activate PKCs , which fur - ther increase the expression of VEGF . Although VEGF is required for normal glomerulogenesis and essential for maintenance of glomerular ﬁltration barrier , podocyte - speciﬁc overexpression of VEGF 164 or VEGF 165 isoform in animals leads to structural and functional renal changes similar to those abnormalities seen in DN , including proteinuria , glomerular hypertrophy , glomeru - lar basement membrane thickening , mesangial expansion , loss of slit diaphragms , and podocyte effacement ( 61 , 62 ) . In DN , the activation of TGF - β 1 has been demonstrated to promote podocyte apoptosis and the development of glomerulosclerosis . A reduced expression level of the proﬁbrotic cytokine TGF - β 1 was detected in diabetic PKC β − / − mice , while the alteration was not observed in diabetic PKC α − / − mice ( 20 ) . This obser - vation suggested that PKC β isoform is more important in the up - regulation of TGF - β and for the development of glomeru - lar ﬁbrosis under diabetic conditions , whereas PKC α shows its critical role in the integrity of glomerular ﬁltration barrier ( 37 ) . However , PKC α plays a key role in the signaling response after stimulation with TGF - β 1 . An enhanced and prolonged activation of PI3K / AKT and ERK1 / 2 as well as a reduced proapoptotic signal - ing via p38MAPK in PKC α - knockout podocytes compared to wild type podocytes was detected after TGF - β 1 treatment , which indi - cated the involvement of PKC α in the TGF - β mediated apoptosis ( 63 ) . Of note , deletion of PKC ε signaling not only leads to increased expression of TGF - β 1 but also induces activation of the TGF - β 1 signaling pathway in glomeruli ( 41 ) . PKC ι might also mediate a high - glucose - induced increase in TGF - β receptor II ( TGF - β RII ) promoter activity , which leads to the up - regulation of TGF - β RII and ﬁbronectin ( 64 ) . PKC REGULATED STRUCTURE PROTEINS IN PODOCYTES P - cadherin as member of the classical cadherins , a superfamily of glycoproteins , is known to be a basic scaffold for the glomerular slit diaphragm ( 65 ) . Xu et al . have ﬁrst demonstrated decreased expression of P - cadherin mRNA and protein in experimental dia - betic glomeruli and in high - glucose stimulated podocytes , which suggests that a potential role for P - cadherin loss in the devel - opment of proteinuria in early DN ( 66 ) . They also found that PKC inhibitors could ameliorate the decrement of P - cadherin in podocytes under high - glucose conditions . Thus , activation of PKC regulated pathways seems to be involved in the regulation of P - cadherin expression and contributes to the disruption of podocyte integrity ( 66 ) . Nevertheless , it seems likely that the molecular changes of the slit diaphragm complex , but not one single slit diaphragm - associated molecule contribute to the pathogenesis of glomerular ﬁltration barrier in DN .

CELL ADHESION Nephrin PICK1 NEPHRINEXOCYTOSIS FIGURE 1 | Schematic overview of PKC - isoform functions in podocytes . DAG or calcium activated PKC α induces nephrin endocytosis via the adaptor molecule Pick1 . PKC λ / ι is required for foot process formation , cell polarity , and nephrin exocytosis . PKC ε might be involved in actin remodeling via small GTPases and might orchestrate cell adhesion and cell – cell contact formation . ZO - 1 are described to compose adherens junctions at the slit diaphragm and establish the link with the actin cytoskeleton ( 65 , 67 ) . However , the role and regulation of β - catenin with P - cadherin and actin cytoskeletal proteins have not been thoroughly explored . In the situation of the podocyte injury induced by high glucose , β - catenin will be released from the destruction com - plex because of the activation of the Wnt - pathway . Afterwards β - catenin translocates into the nucleus to activate the down - stream genes via the aggregation of a transcriptional complex with TCF / LEF , which leads to proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis ( 68 , 69 ) . Several groups demonstrated that PKC activation phospho - rylated N - terminal serine residues of β - catenin , which promoted β - catenin degradation ( 70 , 71 ) . In contrast , our ongoing work was focused on several PKC isoforms , whose activation is able to dephosphorylate β - catenin to prevent β - catenin from degra - dation . It is still unknown , whether this process is protective for the high - glucose - induced cell adherens junction reduction . Nev - ertheless , PKC activation may be a novel mechanism in regulating β - catenin in glomerular injury , which will be further investigated by our laboratory . CONCLUSION Podocyte injury or podocyte loss is a hallmark for the pathogene - sis of DN . Based on the above described ﬁndings , PKC activation seems to be the most critical pathway involved in the progression of glomerular injury . Obviously , there is a ﬁne balance between activation and inactivation of the different PKC isoforms and their cross - talk involving foot process cytoskeletal architecture , cellular junction formation , and orchestration of turnover and surface expression of slit diaphragm components ( Figure 1 ) . Therefore , PKCs and their involved pathways are potential thera - peutic targets in podocytes to prevent the progression of diabetic glomerulopathy . REFERENCES 1 .
