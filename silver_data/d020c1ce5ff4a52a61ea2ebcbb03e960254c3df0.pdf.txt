From the beginning of the COVID - 19 pandemic , using a facemask in different locations was recommended to slow down the spread of the virus . To evaluate facemasks’ performance , masks’ ﬁltration efficiency is tested for a range of particle sizes . Although such tests quantify the blockage of the mask for a range of particle sizes , the test does not quantify the cumulative amount of virus - laden particles inhaled or exhaled by its wearer . In this study , we quantify the accumulated viruses that the healthy person inhales as a function of time , activity level , type of mask , and room condition using a physics - based model . We considered different types of masks , such as surgical masks and ﬁltering facepieces ( FFPs ) , and different characteristics of public places such as office rooms , buses , trains , and airplanes . To do such quantiﬁcation , we implemented a physics - based model of the mask . Our results conﬁrm the importance of both people wearing a mask compared to when only one wears the mask . The protection time for light activity in an office room decreases from 7 . 8 to 1 . 4h with surgical mask IIR . The protection time is further reduced by 85 and 99 % if the infected person starts to cough or increases the activity level , respectively . Results show the leakage of the mask can considerably affect the performance of the mask . For the surgical mask , the apparent ﬁltration efficiency reduces by 75 % with such a leakage , which cannot provide sufficient protection despite the high ﬁltration efficiency of the mask . The facemask model presented provides key input in order to evaluate the protection of masks for different conditions in public places . The physics - based model of the facemask is provided as an online application .

A worldwide pandemic followed the spread of the virus ; on March 11 , 2020 , World Health Organization ( WHO ) characterized the COVID - 19 outbreak as a pandemic ( 2 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 is a coronavirus ; other coronaviruses , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) in 2002 and 2004 and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) in 2012 , had an outbreak ( 3 ) . By the beginning of July 2022 , according to WHO coronavirus dashboard data , more than 540 million cases of infection have been conﬁrmed globally , and more than 6 . 3 million people passed away as a result of COVID - 19 . Throughout the pandemic , the usage of masks was controversial . In January 2020 , WHO announced that the usage of the medical mask is not required as there is no evidence to protect healthy people . In April 2020 , WHO changed the announcement and recommended wearing a medical mask for healthy people who care for an infected person . WHO changed the guidelines for using facemasks by advising to wear them in public when social distancing was not possible in June 2020 . Since the ﬁrst COVID - 19 case report , the importance of wearing a facemask has shown its value in protecting people against this disease ( 4 ) . Additionally , based on the previous studies on COVID - 19 infection data , wearing facemasks by the public can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of transmission and death rate ( 5 , 6 ) . A substantial amount of research has been done on how diﬀerent types of face masks protect the wearers from infection . Standardized mask performance analyses include experiments with controlled laboratory conditions . Here , mask ﬁltration eﬃciency and pressure ( breathing ) resistance are measured ( 7 – 11 ) . Several standards were already available for diﬀerent types of facemasks , such as FFP masks ( EN 149 : 2009 - 08 ) or surgical facemasks ( EN 14683 : 2019 - 10 ) . Additionally , diﬀerent experimental setups have been designed to mimic sneezing or coughing and to investigate their eﬀect on ﬁltration eﬃciency ( 12 – 15 ) . As a result of the immense use of one - time used facemasks and their impact on the environment ( 16 , 17 ) , several studies were conducted for alternative materials to reuse the mask ( 17 , 18 ) or materials whose degradation is environmentally friendly ( 19 , 20 ) . Experimental ﬁltration eﬃciency tests give a good indication to evaluate and compare the performance of diﬀerent mask types . Nevertheless , these tests do not provide information on users’ accumulation of exhaled or inhaled virus - laden particles / aerosols . This cumulative amount depends on the wearer’s breathing rate and the concentration of virus - laden particles in the wearer’s environment . Such information is challenging to measure experimentally . Therefore , researchers have explored mathematical modeling to monitor the fate of exhaled aerosols by an infected person to overcome this hurdle . Heretofore , several studies developed CFD models to predict aerosol disposition in lungs , masks , and environments ( 21 – 25 ) . These studies provide key information on the risk for a healthy person . Yet , these studies do not explore the eﬀect of diﬀerent conditions such as environment , activity levels , and diﬀerent types of masks . Besides the additional information provided by these models , they still do not quantify the risk of infection for people in the environment , as no integration over time is considered . Only a few physics - based models quantify the risk for a healthy person in diﬀerent scenarios ( 26 , 27 ) . A summary of some of the recent studies concerning the risk of COVID - 19 infection , aerosol disposition , and mask ﬁtting by implementing a simulation approach is provided in Table 1 . This study aimed to quantify how long diﬀerent mask types , such as surgical , FFP , and community masks , protect the wearer in four diﬀerent environments at ﬁve diﬀerent activity levels . The studied community mask in this study was a textile mask compatible with Swiss rule ( SNR 30000 ) . The surgical , FFP , and community masks were studied in diﬀerent environments such as an oﬃce room , train , bus , and airplane . We developed a physics - based computational replica of the facemasks that simulate the inﬂow and outﬂow of virus - laden particles for healthy and infected wearers . The model accounts for two people : one infected with the COVID - 19 virus , and the other one is healthy . Diﬀerent types of activities were simulated relevant for various activities , from sitting to more vigorous activities such as running . The eﬀect of speaking and coughing during contact time with a healthy person was also included in the model . Using this model , we quantiﬁed the protection time of standard masks for a healthy person in diﬀerent environments . Background We sketch the main characteristics of mask protection against virus - laden particles . These traits will deﬁne the testing environment we later used for the simulations . Breathing / speaking / coughing Humans breathe continuously , where the duration of inhalation is usually shorter than exhalation . The breathing rate and its pattern depend on the activity level . We exhale endogenously generated particles during breathing , and when we start to speak or cough , larger droplets in higher quantities can be generated ( 36 – 38 ) . Furthermore , the measured median diameter of the droplets we exhale varies for diﬀerent activities resulting in a whole droplet size distribution range of 0 . 1 – 1 , 000 , 000 nm ( 39 ) . Due to the gravitational forces , the droplet > 5 µ m usually settles rather fast in the exhaled air , i . e . , within a meter ( 40 , 41 ) . In addition , the size of the droplets and aerosols can decrease very rapidly due to evaporation in the environment . Most of the emitted aerosols during breathing , speaking , and FrontiersinPublicHealth 02 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 TABLE 1 Summary of some of the recent studies on risk evaluation of COVID - 19 , aerosol disposition , and mask ﬁtting by implementing computational simulation .

The SARS - CoV - 2 virus itself has a diameter size ranging from 65 to 125 nm ( 42 ) , so several viruses can be contained in a single droplet or aerosol . The highest risk of contamination from an infected person for people at a distance comes from the smaller virus - laden particles , so aerosols ( 43 ) . The smallest particles can travel farther or can circulate indoors ( 44 ) . Mask and ﬁltration Facemasks ﬁlter out aerosols and particles from the air . Several types of masks and respirators are now being used to protect from aerosol transmissible diseases , such as community masks , surgical masks , particle ﬁltering half masks , and disposable ﬁltering facepieces ( FFP ) . Masks are ﬁlters that stop the particles by diﬀerent modes of action : interception , inertial impaction , electrostatic deposition , and diﬀusion ( 45 ) . For sub - micron - sized aerosols generated by breathing , masks also rely on electrostatic deposition . This ﬁltration by each of these phenomena strongly depends on the ﬁlter , particles’ size and characteristics , and additional parameters like air ﬂow rate and the ﬁlter properties of the mask . The resulting combination of these ﬁltration eﬀects is quantiﬁed for each particle size in a single metric , namely the particles ﬁltration eﬃciency . The eﬃciency ( FE ) of the ﬁltering device is deﬁned as : FE = 1 − P = 1 − c out c in = 1 − P d max d min c out , d P d max d min c in , d ( 1 ) Where P is the penetration of particles through the ﬁlter , c in refers to the particle concentration in the air entering the ﬁlter , c out is the particle concentration exiting the ﬁlter , and d is particle diameter . Figure 1 shows an overview of the measured ﬁltration eﬃciencies of masks in this study , supplemented with results reported in other studies ( 46 – 50 ) . Here , no mask leakage was accounted for . It can be seen that ﬁltration eﬃciency depends not only on the aerosol diameter but also highly varies for diﬀerent masks and experimental tests . The fractional ﬁltration eﬃciency typically drops around 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 µ m . For this particle size , the ﬁlter collects the least number of particles ( 51 ) . Masks and standards The mask characteristics and standards used to test masks are shown in Table 2 .

The colored lines represent the ﬁltration efficiencies of different types of masks that are being implemented in this study . Materials and methods We mimicked diﬀerent situations in which infected and healthy people are in close contact . To this end , we considered diﬀerent breathing patterns of the people based on their activity level and whether or not they use a facemask . The environment in which they reside is also considered and characterized by the volume of the indoor environment and possible fresh air ventilation . In addition , the change in exposure is investigated for an infected person talking or coughing , which aﬀects the number of emitted aerosols as well as the size distribution . We quantiﬁed the time needed to inhale a number of viruses to have a 50 % chance of infection in a healthy person in a particular environment by considering all these factors . In Figure 2 , the system’s overall structure considering these multiple factors is shown schematically . This study only includes two people who are at a close distance from each other by considering their environment . We assumed that after the aerosols leave the mask of the infected person , they will not be inhaled by the same person . Furthermore , we did not consider any aerosols or viral particles in the system at the initial state . The conditions for the accumulation of aerosols in the room were considered to be well - mixed . Only the aerosols between 100 and 6 , 000 nm were considered in this study . We assumed the aerosols diameter does not change after being emitted by the infected person , and additionally , the activity of viruses stays constant throughout the study . The viral load of aerosols was calculated based on the Zuo et al . ( 52 ) study for MS2 macrophages . ID 50 is the infectious dose for 50 % of the population ; as a result of the lack of data for SARS - CoV - 2 , we use the ID 50 of Inﬂuenza A . These assumptions need to be considered in the interpretation of the results of this study . Experimental measurements of masks Mask air permeability experiment Air permeability is one of the major factors in respect to the comfort of a facemask . High humidity levels inside the mask , which can accumulate over time of wearing , can lead to discomfort , which could result in the incorrect use of the mask . For facemasks , we assumed the airﬂow through the mask is laminar . This implies a linear relationship between the air ﬂow rate through the mask [ G a ( m 3 / s ) ] and the pressure drop [ 1 P i ( Pa ) ] . Therefore , we can apply Darcy ﬂow , with the permeability K [ kg / ( m 4 s ) ] to the airﬂow ( shown in Equation 2 ) . 1 P i = KG a ( 2 ) Since ﬁt to the face of single - use masks is mostly not perfect , there is always a certain amount of air by - passing the ﬁlter material through through the openings . Even leakage in the micrometer scale can be of relevance and become predominant in ﬁlter applications ( 53 ) . However , if leakage is reduced to a minimum , breathing resistance and humidity transport of the ﬁlter material become important factors for the comfort and safety of the mask . In this study , the evaluations were made by considering no leakage ; however , only in Section Eﬀect of leakage of the maskon reaching the threshold , the impact of the leakage on the protection time was explored . The pressure drop ( breathing resistance ) of an ideally homogenous ﬁber ﬁlter material is shown in Equation 3 . ∇ P i = ∝ 4 d 2F µ u i z = − µ κ i u i z ( 3 ) FrontiersinPublicHealth 04 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 TABLE 2 Standards and characteristics of FFP2 , surgical mask , and community mask .

As the breathing resistance of the mask ( α 4 µ z / d 2F ) decreases , the breathability of the mask increases . Consequently , a critical aspect of good breathability of mask materials is to minimize packing density while maintaining ﬁltration eﬃciency . The best way to achieve this is to use ﬁne ﬁbers at a relevant thickness simultaneously . The diameter of ﬁbers in common facemasks is between 0 . 5 and 10 µ m ( 54 ) . Airﬂow resistance for continuous airﬂow can be measured in calibrated devices described in EN 14683 or with air permeability test benches ( ISO 9237 ) . If air permeability test devices are used , it is recommended to use the sample size requested from the mask test standard and to re - calculate the pressure over the given test surface area from the set test pressure . The pressure resistance for the diﬀerent types of masks included in this study is provided in Table 3 . Mask ﬁltration efficiency experiment To perform ﬁltration eﬃciency tests , a circular specimen with a diameter of 60 mm was sampled from a mask and sealed airtight in a sample holder to obtain an eﬀective test surface of 1 . 66 ∗ 10 3 mm 2 . An aerosol was drawn with an aerosol generator ( AGK2000 ) from a solution of 2 . 5 g ml − 1 of fructose in demineralized water . Fructose particles at a concentration of 350 mg m − 3 in dried air were neutralized in a corona discharging unit ( CD2000 ) and driven to the sample . A constant airﬂow of 9L min − 1 was set through the mask specimen ( from outside to inside ) . Particle penetration through the sample was quantiﬁed using the particle analyzer Combustion DMS500 ) . This “Fast Particulate Spectrometer” uses unipolar corona charging and parallel detection of particles of varying electrical mobility to oﬀer real - time measurement of the particle size spectrum between 5 and 2 , 500 nm . The ﬁltration eﬃciency was determined by comparing a steady ﬂow of particles after a constant concentration was reached for 2min with the mask sample and afterward measuring FrontiersinPublicHealth 05 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 FIGURE2 The overall structure of the modeling system , including breathing condition , mask type , environment , activity level , and modeling assumptions , is depicted here ( the icons are from https : / / www . ﬂaticon . com / ) .

The ﬁltration eﬃciency for speciﬁc aerosol diameters for the diﬀerent masks included in this study is presented in Table 4 . The community mask in this study is 100 % polyester , which is equipped with an anti - bacterial treatment . This mask has a splash resistance at the pressure of 12 kPa based on ISO 22609 and air pressure resistance of < 70 Pa cm − 2 based on EN 14683 . Physics - based model for virus ﬁltration Computational system conﬁguration This study modeled a rectangular one - dimensional domain that represents a fraction of a mask with a length of 2 . 5 [ cm ] , similar to the standard experiments , and a width of 0 . 5 [ mm ] . The air permeability coeﬃcients for mask types were calculated based on experimental data ( Table 3 ) . With this , the velocity of the air and the total air exhaled / inhaled air volume was calculated dependent on the breathing rate to get the total number of aerosols . As air goes solely through the mask , the mask will ﬁlter a fraction of these aerosols based on their diameter . As such , only a part of these particles will penetrate through the mask and reach the surrounding area . This study assumed that any aerosol passing the mask would not be inhaled again by the infected person but would remain in the environment . The environment was considered to be instantly well - mixed , implying that the concentration of particles in the environment is uniform at all times . On the other hand , a healthy person will inhale the accumulated aerosols in the environment . If this healthy person is wearing the mask , only a fraction of these aerosols will reach the respiratory tract .

The zone between the respiratory airway and mask for the infected person , 2 . The mask characteristics of the infected person , 3 . the characteristics of the room in which these two people are meeting , 4 . The mask characteristics of the healthy person 5 . The zone between the respiratory airway and mask for the infected person , and 6 . The inner airway of a healthy person ( Figure 3 ) . Governing equations Airﬂow The experimental data shows a linear relationship between airﬂow through the ﬁlter of the mask and the pressure drop . This relation implies that Darcy’s law can predict the airﬂow behavior through the mask in the operational range of airspeed for breathing which is brought in Equation 3 . The continuity is applicable for airﬂow , and it is given by Equation 4 . ∇ . u i = 0 ( 4 ) Aerosol transport The contaminated particles emitted by an infected person during breathing , coughing , and speaking will be partially ﬁltered by the facemask , whereas the remaining will be spread into the environment , where healthy people can inhale them . To evaluate the fraction of ﬁltrated aerosols in the mask , we considered ﬁltration eﬃciency as a function of mask type and aerosol diameter . The mass conservation for the number of aerosols is mentioned in the following equations ( 5 – 10 ) . As mentioned earlier , we considered six diﬀerent zones , for which we solved each transport equation for the particles ( Figure 3 ) : 1 .

In these equations , FE 1i refers to the ﬁltration eﬃciency of the infected person’s mask , and FE 2i refers to the ﬁltration eﬃciency of the healthy person’s mask . Viral load per aerosol A variety of respiratory viruses like inﬂuenza virus and acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) coronavirus are available in high concentrations in infected human saliva and respiratory mucus . The produced aerosols from human saliva will carry these viruses by breathing , talking , and coughing . The virus content of these aerosols is dependent on the aerosol’s diameter . FrontiersinPublicHealth 07 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 FIGURE3 Geometry and boundary conditions of the overall model for two people ( infected and healthy people ) in close contact . The modeled geometry consists of 6 zones : the zone between the respiratory airway and mask for the infected person ; the mask of the infected person ; the room in which these two people are meeting : the mask of the healthy person ; the zone between the respiratory airway and mask for the infected person ; and the inner airway of a healthy person . Based on the Zuo et al . study , the number of MS2 bacteriophages [ plaque - forming unit ( PFU ) ] per aerosol based on its diameter is shown in Equation 11 . N v _ i [ PFU aerosol ] = 1 . 55 × 10 − 13 × d 3 . 41 p [ nm ] ( 11 ) Where N v _ i are the number of bacteriophages per aerosol and d p is the aerosol’s diameter ( 52 ) . As MS2 bacteriophages are nonpathogenic , it is one of the most common human - pathogenic virus surrogates and they are used in various viral studies ( 52 ) . Due to the lack of similar data for SARS - CoV - 2 , we assume that the condition for the viral load of SARS - CoV - 2 in the exhaled aerosols by an infected person is similar to MS2 bacteriophages ( Equation 11 ) . Material properties and transport characteristics of mask and environment Boundary and initial conditions On the inner side of the mask for the infected and healthy person , the airﬂow at the boundary condition is time and activity level dependent . The airﬂow intensity and pattern based on time and activity level are shown in Table 5 . The exhaled breath of the infected person is the source of aerosols , which depends on the volume of exhaled air that enters the room by expiration ( 55 ) . The data reported in Fabian et al . study is up to 9 L / min minute ventilation . For calculating the number of aerosols for higher minute ventilation , we evaluated the number of emitted aerosols by extrapolation , which can increase the error in the calculations . The initial number of virus - laden aerosols in the entire system ( the six blocks shown in Figure 3 ) is set to zero . The breathing pattern provided in Table 5 was implemented in the model by interpolation and deﬁning its peak and duration based on the reported peak ﬂow and breathing frequency in this table . Simulated conﬁgurations Human exposure is simulated in diﬀerent environments such as an oﬃce room , a bus , a train , and an airplane . The properties of these rooms are detailed in Table 6 . The volume of each room is modiﬁed based on the capacity of the room to ﬁnd the eﬀective volume for the situation when the infected FrontiersinPublicHealth 08 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 TABLE 5 Breathing pattern based on activity level .

In such a way , if the bus cabin volume is roughly 109 m 3 , and the capacity of the bus is 77 people , by dividing the volume by every two people , we reach the number of 2 . 5 m 3 , which is reported in Table 6 . In this regard , as a worst - case scenario , the volume of the train , bus , and airplane cabin is divided by their capacity to calculate the volume when these two people are in close contact . The volume of the environment and air ventilation directly impact the concentration of aerosols in the room . In the train , as the normalized volume increases by one cubic meter , the concentration of aerosols reduces by 20 % , which should be noted in interpreting the result of this study . In this study , we assumed additional varieties such as talking and coughing . When the person starts to talk or cough , the emitted aerosol’s total number and size distribution will change . However , this can vary between individuals , the intensity , or even what sort of words are expressed . To reduce the complexity , we decided to only consider an average value for the total number of emitted aerosols during talking and coughing . Based on previous studies , for particles in the range of 500 [ nm ] to 20 [ µ m ] , the total number of emitted aerosol during talking and coughing is three times and 20 times higher than regular breathing , respectively ( 63 , 64 ) . A repetitive speaking - breathing pattern of 10 [ s ] talking FrontiersinPublicHealth 09 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 followed by 10 [ s ] of breathing was applied . For coughing , the data was extracted from the Johnson et al . study in which volunteers had a mild throat - clearing cough intensity with a continuous frequency while they were comfortable during 30 [ s ] ( 37 ) . We additionally considered three more scenarios for coughing , which imply the situations when the infected person coughs 50 , 25 , or 10 % of the mentioned frequency for coughing . Numerical implementation and simulation COMSOL Multiphysics R (cid:13) software ( version 5 . 6 , COMSOL AB , Stockholm , Sweden ) , a ﬁnite - element - based commercialized software , was used in this study . The airﬂow simulation was done using equation - based modeling to solve Darcy’s law and continuity , modeled by the ODE interface in COMSOL . The particle transfer was modeled by assuming well - mixed domains and was modeled by using the ODE interface in COMSOL . Quadratic Lagrange elements were used with a fully coupled direct solver , which relied on the MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver ( MUMPS ) solver scheme . In order to capture the ﬂuctuation of airﬂow , aerosol and viral density of the environment , the time step of 0 . 01 [ min ] was chosen . The tolerances for solver settings and convergence were determined by means of sensitivity analysis in such a way that a further increase in the tolerance did not alter the resulting solution . Metrics Based on the minute breathing rate ( ˙ V [ L . min − 1 ] ) the total volume of ventilated air at each time step for each person is calculated , as in Equation 12 . V t = Z t 0 ˙ V . dt ( 12 ) Which , V t is the total volume of ventilated air up to time t . The total number of emitted and inhaled aerosols and corresponding virus particles are calculated with Equations 13 – 14 . c it = c i 1 + c i 2 + c i 3 + c i 4 + c i 5 + c i 6 ( 13 ) N v _ it = N v _ i 1 + N v _ i 2 + N v _ i 3 + N v _ i 4 + N v _ i 5 + N v _ i 6 ( 14 ) The protection time in this study is deﬁned as the time when the number of inhaled viruses in a healthy person reaches a particular threshold . This threshold is deﬁned by ID 50 representing the minimum number of viruses needed to infect 50 % of persons exposed . Due to the lack of suﬃcient data for SARS - CoV - 2 , we assumed the ID 50 of Inﬂuenza A [ 790 ( 65 ) ] is the same as SARS - CoV - 2 . Besides the number of inhaled particles , the time window of exposure can also aﬀect the possible infection . Given the limited information on this eﬀect on the infection risk , we did not consider this . Results and discussion Air ventilation As mentioned in Section Simulated conﬁgurations , regular air ventilation of the room is considered to limit the increase ( Equation 7 ) in the concentration of the aerosols in the room . To investigate the eﬀect of ventilation on the total number of aerosols in the environment , the oﬃce room ( detail in Table 5 ) was studied by considering ﬁve diﬀerent activity levels in 2 conditions with and without air ventilation , while the infected person did not wear a facemask . The result is shown in Figure 4 . Based on the result , when we have air ventilation in the oﬃce room , by increasing the activity level from 1 to 5 , in 30min , the total number of aerosols increases by about 2 , 600 times . On the other hand , if the oﬃce room does not have any air ventilation , the total number of aerosols in the environment during 30min for diﬀerent activity levels will increase to about 100 times more compared to the room with air ventilation . Therefore , the lack of air ventilation can considerably increase the risk of infection even considering the lowest activity level . Based on the result in Figure 4A , as the activity level increases , the ﬂuctuation in the aerosol concentration in the room increases too . This high ﬂuctuation of aerosol concentration undermines the well - mixed assumption for higher activity levels . Contamination of the environment with virus - laden particles by an infected person for different activity levels and mask types This section quantiﬁes how much infected - person contaminates their environment and how much facemasks can help avoid this contamination . A SARS - CoV - 2 infected person constantly emits respiratory aerosols during breathing and also droplets during talking or coughing , all of which contain viruses . These exhausted virus - laden aerosols spread the virus and put healthy people at risk . The diameter distribution of aerosols we have used in this study is based on the literature shown in Figure 5A . By considering diﬀerent activity levels , we map the total emitted number of aerosols and viruses from an infected FrontiersinPublicHealth 10 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 FIGURE4 ( A ) Number of emitted aerosol in the office room with air ventilation during 30min by 5 different activity levels ; ( B ) activity level 1 ; ( C ) activity level 2 ; ( D ) Number of emitted aerosol in the office room without air ventilation during 30min by ﬁve different activity levels ; ( E ) activity level 1 ; ( F ) activity level 2 , with no mask ( the icons are from https : / / www . ﬂaticon . com / ) . person for 30 [ min ] . As the person’s activity level increases , the exhaled air volume increases too . By increasing the volume of air , the number of exhausted aerosols increases . Figures 5B , C shows the total volume and the total number of exhaled aerosols based on the activity level . The total number of exhaled aerosols for activity level 1 ( such as sitting ) during breathing after 30 [ min ] is equal to 1 . 28 ∗ 10 12 . Each aerosol can carry a diﬀerent number of viruses based on its size . Based on the aerosol size distribution and the relationship between the aerosol’s initial volume and viral load , the total number of emitted viruses is shown in Figure 5D . The eﬀect of facemasks in reducing the total number of emitted aerosols to the environment for diﬀerent activity levels compared to not wearing a mask in blocking aerosols is shown in Figures 5E , G , I , K , M . The corresponding eﬀect on the emission of viruses is shown in Figures 5J , F , H , J , L , N . The number of emitted aerosols to the environment increases with more strenuous activity levels and corresponding increased breathing activity . As the total number of emitted aerosols for activity level 1 ( only breathing ) during 30 [ min ] is 1 . 28 ∗ 10 12 while this number is 3 . 14 ∗ 10 15 ( almost 2 , 500 times more ) for high exertions . This implies that the high activity of the infected person increases the virus concentration in the environment . During this 30 [ min ] , 99 . 8 % of the total number of aerosols and 99 . 9 % of the number of viruses were blocked by the FFP2 mask . For the same scenario , surgical mask type I , which has the lowest ﬁltration eﬃciency among the standardized masks , blocked 89 . 4 % of aerosols and 95 . 9 % of viruses . The ﬁltration eﬃciency of FFP2 is 11 . 6 % more than surgical mask type I , while FFP2 viral blockage is only 4 . 2 % more than surgical mask type I . On the other hand , the FFP2 mask reduced the number of emitted aerosols by 600 times , while it reduced the number of viral particles by 3 , 500 times . By comparison of these numbers , we realize that the mask must have a high ﬁltration eﬃciency for aerosols that have a higher frequency [ 200 – 1 , 000 ( nm ) ] and aerosols which carry a higher number of viral copies [ > 2 , 000 ( nm ) , as they are larger , they can carry more viruses ] . Therefore , the overall average ﬁltration eﬃciency of a mask does not give us how eﬀective this mask is for reducing the viral contamination of the environment . Protection time of different mask types for a healthy person A speciﬁc number of viruses need to enter the body via the respiratory tract of each individual to infect that person . In a healthy population , the risk probability of infecting 50 % of FrontiersinPublicHealth 11 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 FIGURE5 ( A ) diameter distribution of exhaled aerosols by the infected person , ( B ) accumulated ventilated air by the infected person , ( C , E , G , I , K , M ) total exhaled aerosols , ( D , F , H , J , L , N ) total exhaled viruses during ﬁve activity levels ( sitting , walking , moderate activities , running , and sprinting ) by using no mask ( 0 ) , surgical mask I ( 1 ) , surgical mask II ( 2 ) , surgical mask IIR ( 3 ) , FFP1 ( 4 ) , FFP2 ( 5 ) , and community mask ( 6 ) by the infected person in 30 [ min ] ( the icons are from https : / / www . ﬂaticon . com / ) . FIGURE6 ( A ) Diameter distribution of exhaled aerosols by the infected person during breathing , speaking , and coughing , ( B ) protection time for a healthy person in an office room . FrontiersinPublicHealth 12 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 people is deﬁned by the ID 50 value . As diﬀerent aspects of SARS - CoV - 2 , including ID 50 , are still unknown , we used the reported ID 50 for the Inﬂuenza A . virus and analyzed diﬀerent conditions aﬀecting reaching this threshold . Effect of breathing condition on mask protection time Diﬀerent conditions , such as speaking and coughing , change the distribution and number of emitted aerosols , which is shown in Figure 6A . The protection time while an infected person might start to talk or cough is shown in Figure 6B . We considered four diﬀerent scenarios in an oﬃce room : 1 . None of them wear masks 2 and 3 . One of them wears surgical masks IIR , and 4 . Both of them wear surgical masks IIR . The maximum protection time we considered in this study was to be 8 [ h ] ( referring to a maximum residence time in the room ) , and we did not continue analyzing the performance after this time . Based on the result , if the infected and healthy persons both wear a mask , the protection time at each condition is over 8 [ h ] . We did not observe any diﬀerences in scenarios 2 and 3 , where only one person wore the surgical mask . This similarity can be explained by the one - way transmission of the virus , which we assumed in this simulation . If the infected person constantly coughs , the protection time reduces to < 20 % of the time the infected person does not cough and speak . Even with a lower frequency of coughing ( Coughing - 4 , which has 10 % of the frequency of the maximum number of coughs in a deﬁned time ) , the protection time is reduced by 40 % , which is similar to the reduction of protection during talking in the condition without a mask . Effect of activity level on mask protection time We quantiﬁed how variations in the breathing pattern by changes in the activity level aﬀect the number of emitted aerosols ( Section Air ventilation ) and the protection time of diﬀerent masks . In this regard , we considered the same four scenarios : 1 . none of the people ( infected and healthy people ) wears a mask , 2 . only the infected person wears a surgical mask IIR , 3 . only the healthy person wears a surgical mask IIR , and 4 . both of them wear surgical mask IIR . The environment for this study is a standard oﬃce room with a modiﬁed volume of 28 m 3 . As is shown in Figure 7 , when both people increase their activity level from 1 to 2 ( e . g . , from sitting to walking ) , the protection time decreases by more than 90 % when only one of them wears the mask . Suppose they increase their activity to higher levels ; in that case , the protection time decreases drastically for the maximum activity ; even if both of them wear the surgical mask IIR , the protection time remains only to be 10 [ min ] . It should be noted that when the protection time is so low ( lower than 10min ) , the condition does not meet the requirement for a well - mixed assumption . Therefore , the evaluated protection time for these conditions might considerably deviate from reality . In this case , the protection time depends on the distance and location of healthy and infected persons can be higher or lower . However , it still can be concluded that the protection time when both people have high activity is considerably low . This can be an issue in places where people might engage in demanding activities , like gym and indoor work with high physical demand . Effect of room enclosure on mask protection time Contact between a healthy and infected person can occur in diﬀerent environments such as oﬃce rooms , buses , trains , and airplanes . As the aerosols get emitted by an infected person to the environment by considering an instantaneously well - mixed medium , their concentration gets diluted by the volume of the environment . For larger environments such as airplanes , trains , and buses , considering a well - mixed scenario for emitted aerosol from one infected person to the area might be considered far from reality . However , as it is mentioned in Section Simulated conﬁgurations , we only consider the volume that the infected person and healthy person are in close contact with each other , based on the total volume of the cabin and its capacity . By considering this smaller volume , choosing a well - mixed scenario can be useful in describing the concentration of aerosols . On the other hand , if the two people stay close to each other and start to cough or talk toward each other , the exposure of the healthy person to aerosols will be higher than in the well - mixed scenario . However , as we aimed to study a general case , we did not take to account the very speciﬁc conditions that can worsen or improve the infection risks . If the environment has air ventilation , the dilution is further increased . Based on the studied environment , We only considered low activities such as sitting , while the infected person might speak or cough at diﬀerent frequencies . In this section , a surgical mask IIR was implemented . Three diﬀerent scenarios of wearing the mask were studied : 1 . None of them is wearing the mask , 2 . One of them is wearing a mask and 3 . Both of them are wearing masks . In Figure 8 , the result is shown by considering the average residence time for each environment ( horizontal green line ) . Based on the result , if both people do not wear a mask , the protection time is shorter than the average residence time in all the environments . If only one of them wears the mask while breathing , the healthy person is protected longer than the average staying time . However , when the infected person starts to cough , the protection time drops , which might put the healthy person in danger . In every case , the healthy person can have a lower chance of getting infected in these environments for the assumed time if both of them wear the mask . Based on the result , in the bus , by only breathing , when only one of them wears the surgical mask IIR the protection time is 1 . 3h , while if both of them wear a facemask , the safe exposure duration increases by 4 . 5 folds to 7 . 1 h . If both people wear a FrontiersinPublicHealth 13 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 FIGURE7 Protection time for a healthy person in an office room during different activity levels .

The star represents the too low protection time which is not compatible with the well - mixed assumption ( the icons are from https : / / www . ﬂaticon . com / ) . FIGURE8 Protection time for a healthy person in close contact with an infected person in office room , bus , train , and airplane , with or without surgical mask IIR , by considering the infected person’s breathing , coughing , and speaking . The dashed green line represents the average staying time in each environment ( the icons are from https : / / www . ﬂaticon . com / ) . facemask on the train by only breathing , the protection time is 8h , while if only one wears it , this number is only 2 . 8 h . On an airplane , by only breathing , the protection time for both people wearing masks is 8h , and if only one of them wears a facemask is 2 . 1 [ h ] . It should be considered that as the infected person starts to talk or cough , the risk for the healthy person increases considerably . Therefore , it is better if both people wear a facemask to reduce the risk of infection in conditions such as coughing , speaking of the infected person , or staying on longer journeys . Effect of leakage of the mask on reaching the threshold So far , the entire simulation was executed by the assumption of a fully sealed mask . Based on this assumption , all the exhaled and inhaled air passes through the mask , which ﬁlters the aerosols . However , this deviates from reality , as poorly ﬁtting masks and improper use of masks must be considered . This section considers the impact of leakage on the ﬁltering performance of surgical mask IIR , FFP2 , and Community masks . The ﬁltration eﬃciency for these three masks by considering FrontiersinPublicHealth 14 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 FIGURE9 ( A ) Filtration efficiency for the surgical mask IIR , FFP2 , and community mask by considering leakage , ( B ) protection time while the healthy and infected people both wear the same mask in an office room with ventilation . the sealed and unsealed full - size masks on Sheﬃeld’s head is shown in Figure 9A . There is a diﬀerence between the ﬁltration eﬃciency of sealed masks in this section and the ﬁltration eﬃciencies considered for the same type of masks in previous simulations . These variations are due to diﬀerent experimental setups and diﬀerent batches of the masks . A mannequin head ( Sheﬃeld’s head ) was considered for this measurement , while the data reported in Table 4 is a ﬁxed setup . Another deviation is that the solution of 0 . 02 g ml − 1 of fructose in demineralized water was used for this data , and fructose particles at a concentration of 35mg m − 3 in dried air were neutralized in a corona discharging unit ( CD2000 ) and driven to the sample . By analyzing the ﬁltration eﬃciency of sealed and unsealed facemasks , a considerable drop in apparent ﬁltering is observed for all types of masks . This drop was more drastic for surgical mask type IIR . However , the ﬁltration eﬃciency of the mask is similar regardless of the sealing . As a result of the gap between the face and the mask , a part of the air enters and reaches the room without being ﬁltered through the mask . Therefore , the apparent ﬁltration eﬃciency of the unsealed facemask is lower than the sealed masks . The diﬀerent levels of impact of leakage on the apparent ﬁltration eﬃciencies of these masks could be related to their shapes and ﬁtting to the face . In Section Contamination of the environment with virus laden particles by an infected person for diﬀerent activity levels and mask types , the result showed that the performance that FFP2 provides is considerably higher than that of the surgical mask type IIR . Furthermore , the performance of surgical mask IIR is considerably higher than the community mask . The result in Figure 9B for an oﬃce room , while both people wear the same type of mask , shows that the performance of FFP2 is almost in the same range as for surgical mask IIR and community mask by considering the unsealed condition . Additionally , the protection time for an unsealed surgical mask is lower than for an unsealed community mask . The air that passes through the gaps will be not be ﬁltered , and the air that passes through the mask will be ﬁltered . The leaked airﬂow can then be calculated based on the ratio of airﬂow from the mask to airﬂow from the gap . If we assume the mask tested in sealed and un - sealed conditions will have the same ﬁltration eﬃciency . Therefore , for surgical mask IIR , community mask , and FFP2 , only 25 . 2 % ( SD : 1 . 9 % ) , 39 . 2 % ( SD : 2 . 6 % ) , and 54 . 5 % ( SD : 1 . 4 % ) of airﬂow go through the mask . This implies that besides the high ﬁltration eﬃciency of the surgical mask IIR , it cannot protect the wearer as expected due to its poor face sealing . Virtual mask tester We transformed our physics - based model of facemask into an openly accessible computer program named ’the Virtual Mask Tester’ ( Figure 10 ) . This application is suitable for users interested in evaluating the performance of masks in diﬀerent conditions . The mask can be the standard or newly developed masks for personal or production uses . The user can choose diﬀerent environments for the study . Besides the deﬁned environment in this study , they can deﬁne a room with custom volume and air ventilation . Users can even evaluate their own masks with a custom particle - size - dependent ﬁltration eﬃciency . The link to access the application is here . The model implemented in this application is built based on the physics and assumptions described in Section Physics based model for virus ﬁltration . However , in order to decrease the runtime , the breathing pattern was modeled by a sinusoidal model instead of interpolating from the realistic pattern of the breathing .

Conclusions Facemasks play an essential role in limiting the number of exhaled virus - laden aerosols in the environment , decreasing the risk of infection for healthy people , and reducing the risk of a pandemic . Based on our results , when the infected person wears a fully sealed FFP2 , the number of emitted aerosols and viruses was reduced to 1 / 600 and 1 / 3 , 500 , respectively . Therefore , it clearly increases the protection time for the wearer . The diﬀerence observed in reducing the number of aerosols and viruses implies that besides the overall ﬁltration eﬃciency , it is important to consider ﬁltration of particular particle sizes to be highly relevant for virus transmission . Additional to the facemasks , the activity level of the infected person aﬀected the emitted aerosols drastically . Based on the result , as the activity level of the infected person increases , the total emitted aerosols in the environment might increase up to 2 , 500 times . This increase in the number of emitted aerosols aﬀects the protection time , which is 300 times higher for the very low activity level than the very high activity level . This drastic change via activity shows the importance of additional safety measures in environments with highly active people . In the last step , we analyzed the eﬀect of leakage on mask performance . Three types of masks were analyzed : surgical mask IIR , community mask , and FFP2 . Based on the experimental input , the drop in the apparent ﬁltration eﬃciency for surgical mask IIR is more drastic than the other two , leading to lower protection time . This result revealed that , despite the high ﬁltration eﬃciency of the surgical mask , the leakage could diminish its performance . Besides the surgical mask IIR , the leakage for the community mask and FFP2 was considerable as well and reduced the protection time considerably . This result showed that as much as the ﬁltration eﬃciency of a mask is important , the ﬁtting of the mask on the face can also play an important role . In addition , the result of this study shows the impact of hygienic measures such as wearing masks and ventilating the rooms on protecting the people at risk of infection and their relevance for diﬀerent types of rooms . The result of this study is based on the FrontiersinPublicHealth 16 frontiersin . org Bahrami et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 991455 assumptions mentioned in Section Background ; therefore , the exact calculated values may not explain any speciﬁc situation ; rather , this data can give insight into the general trends . The use of such a physics - based model to quantify the protection time of the wearer can be instrumental in evaluating new mask designs .
