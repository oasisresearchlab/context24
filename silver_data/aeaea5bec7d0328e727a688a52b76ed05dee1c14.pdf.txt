The Case for Negotiation Robots in simulated workplace negotiations : A Theoretical Approach Andres Rosero , Molly Kluck , Amie MacKay George Mason University Job negotiations are an anxiety - inducing and highly important form of social interaction . Most people are not sufficiently trained in negotiation strategies and often do not receive job offers that are conducive to financial stability . With the rise of virtual agents and robotics that are capable of modeling social interactions , a significant research effort has been established to create realistic simulations of negotiations . While the bulk of this research has focused on virtual agents as a medium for simulated negotiations , we propose that embodied agents can be utilized to model the inherent nuances in human interaction . In this paper , we propose a study that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of embodied agents compared to virtual agents in simulated negotiations with human participants . INTRODUCTION Starting salaries have a lasting impact on the potential quality of life . Starting salaries form the basis for bonuses and subsequent job offers . When a person is searching for a new job , their prospective employer assesses their worth based on their current or prior salary . One study found that those who negotiated for their salary—instead of accepting the first offer—made an average increase of $ 5 , 000 ( Marks & Harold , 2011 ) . One group that does not often negotiate for higher salaries is women ( Babcock & Laschever ; Barron , 2003 ; Stuhlmacher & Walters , 1999 ) . It is possible that this lack of negotiation may be a contributing factor to the gender wage gap . There are efforts underway to design artificially intelligent ( AI ) negotiators who can train individuals in the art of negotiation or can act as proxies in negotiations ( Gratch , 2021 ) . Job interviews and salary negotiations have traditionally taken place over face - to - face ( F2F ) communication . The contemporary shift towards virtual interviews and job negotiations has necessitated the modeling of human interactions in virtual environments . AI frameworks used for training human negotiators would be more effective if they use tactics that model both F2F interactions and if they can model human interactions in computer - mediated communication ( CMC ) . As virtual work meetings become normalized , we need to account for differences in body language that occurs when humans interact through CMC . The purpose of this article is to propose a method for examining the differences in nonverbal behaviors when humans interact with artificial agents and virtual agents . In the first section , we will discuss negotiations and their implications for underrepresented groups . We will then give a brief overview of human behavior in virtual and simulated environments , followed by a discussion on the differences between embodied and virtual agents . In the final section , we propose a research study and discuss the importance of conducting this research . Negotiation Defined Negotiation is a process where multiple agents attempt to achieve desirable outcomes in a scenario where conflict exists ( Rockmann , Langfred , & Cronin , 2019 ) . Negotiations involve dynamic cognitive , behavioral , and social components . Negotiation is different from a general obstacle or problem in that it involves two or more interdependent parties . Negotiations involve decision - making based on an incomplete understanding of alternatives . The four traditional negotiation strategies are collaboration , competition , accommodation , and avoidance . These strategies are identified along a continuum of assertiveness and cooperation . The goals of a negotiation influence the strategy and corresponding approach implemented by each party . Two primary approaches to negotiation are understanding , where value is obtained by gaining insight into the other party , and convincing , where value is obtained by altering the behaviors or beliefs of the other party ( Rockmann , Langfred , & Cronin , 2019 ) . Job negotiations for underrepresented groups Job negotiations involve bartering for overall compensation packages . These packages include salaries , 401 ( K ) contributions , stock options , equity percentages , bonuses , PTO , childcare , and numerous additional considerations . Every person has a different set of ideal outcomes in a job negotiation . It is critical that people identify their preferences and plan for a negotiation that reflects their values . Negotiation planning requires thoughtful consideration of the values maintained by the opposing party . Once the malleable components of negotiation have been established , the next step is developing the negotiation approach ( Rockmann , Langfred , & Cronin , 2019 ) . There are systematic differences between people regarding their approach to negotiations ( Rockmann , Langfred , & Cronin , 2019 ) . Factors that influence how an individual negotiates include age , sex , race , and socioeconomic status . Willingness to negotiate and the result of negotiations contribute towards income inequality . Individuals in marginalized groups—such as women and people of color—often accept job offers without negotiating , or accepting offers that do not reflect their worth as employees . Assertiveness exhibited by women has traditionally been perceived as negative and has been systematically discouraged ( Eriksson & Sandberg , 2012 ) . People of color are taught at an early age that life is unfair due to racial bias and that their needs will be systematically disregarded ( Hernandez et al . , 2019 ) . While the societal issues C op y r i gh t 2022 b y H u m an F a c t o r s and E r gono m i cs S o c i e t y . A ll r i gh t s r e s e r v ed . 10 . 1177 / 1071181322661383 Proceedings of the 2022 HFES 66th International Annual Meeting 1095 at play are beyond the scope of this project , there is a demonstrated need to reduce the wage gap by assisting women and people of color in salary negotiations . In order to meet the needs of these minority groups , it is imperative to ensure that they receive sufficient opportunities for negotiation training and skill development . Current state of simulated environments One field of research dedicated to negotiation training and skill development involves negotiation AI agent frameworks . The goals of this research are to train people to become personal advocates for salary negotiations . These AI negotiations aim to simulate authentic interactions between humans in the workplace . Negotiation frameworks like IAGO ( Mell & Gratch , 2017 ) . simulate negotiations using a menu - based interface between a human participant and a virtual agent ( Figure 1 ) . The IAGO framework has been Figure 1 : IAGO Interface adjusted to simulate negotiation scenarios such as job negotiations ( Johnson & Gratch , 2020 ) . Modifications to the base IAGO algorithm have used enhanced emotional recognition to enrich interactions with IAGO ( Mell et al . , 2018 ; Johnson & Gratch , 2020 ; Gratch , 2021 ) . Frameworks such as CaSiNo use a text - based approach to simulating negotiations in virtual space with phrases common to real - life negotiations ( Chawla et al . , 2021 ) . Chatbot frameworks have been used in simulations of resource allocation to determine satisfaction and agent likeness through emoticon systems . These simulations suggest that desirable outcomes are possible between humans and agents sensitive to emotional perception ( Chawla et al . , 2021 ) . The current state of this technology involves the negotiation framework being contained within a virtual environment . As such , the model that is being built may resemble CMC negotiations more than F2F negotiations . Human behavior in virtual environments Emotional expressions and nonverbal behaviors compound the complexities inherent to negotiations . The ability to recognize emotions in others and the ability to convey specific emotions can have an effect on the outcome of negotiations . There is cultural variability regarding the extent to which emotional displays are considered acceptable . For example , there are different beliefs amongst people regarding the utility of nonverbal behaviors such as leaning forward , poker faces , and eye contact ( Chu et al . , 2005 ) . These cross - cultural differences highlight the importance of understanding emotional expressions during negotiations ( Van Kleef et al . , 2008 ) . Nonverbal communications can sometimes tell negotiators more about what the other side wants than the statements themselves ( Peleckis , Peleckieṅe , & Polajeva , 2016 ; Lincoln , 2000 ) . A large part of received information comes from nonverbal communication , including body posturing and facial expressions ( Lincoln , 2000 ) . Human interactions over CMC are different from those in F2F interactions . Some of these differences are addressed by changes in the delivery and perception of nonverbal behaviors . Humans tasked to complete objectives in CMC environments take longer than those tasked with the same objective while F2F ( Lee , 2010 ; Rouhshad , Wigglesworth , & Storch , 2016 ) . It was found that participants using CMC evaluated their collaborators less favorably than in F2F interactions and performed worse in social - emotional tasking ( Lee , 2010 ) . An emerging line of research called CMC Exhaustion—also known as “Zoom Fatigue”—could explain the differences in outcomes between CMC and F2F teaming differences ( Nadler , 2020 ) . CMC Exhaustion details how interactions through online platforms like Zoom cause changes to nonverbal behaviors and have a negative relationship to productive interactions ( Bailenson , 2021 ) . This theory was supported by research on CMC interactions , where it was found that there were significant differences in many nonverbal behavior metrics during conversations ( Bailenson , 2021 ; Offir et al . , 2004 ) . Among the key differences , multiple studies noted variations in eye contact , posture , and facial expressions when interacting with collaborators over CMC platforms when compared to F2F communications ( Bailenson , 2021 ; Offir et al . , 2004 ; Tyler et al . , 2021 ) . These differences have a profound effect on perceptions of collaborators as well as task outcomes ( Lee , 2010 ) . Differences in human nonverbal behaviors over a virtual space are exacerbated if the collaborator the human is interacting with is a virtual agent or a human being . Humans perceive interactions with virtual agents differently than with other humans . Research has demonstrated that there is a difference in nonverbal communication behaviors from a human towards a virtual agent when compared to human collaborators ( Ochs et al . , 2017 ) . To further complicate matters , there is also a difference between how humans interact with virtual agents and how they interact with embodied agents ( Li , 2015 ) . Virtual agents versus Embodied robots Virtual agents are defined as artificial agents which are contained to a screen of a device through a depiction of an artificial agent . These agents can look robotic or look like humans with skin and hair , like the Replika AI companions . Embodied agents are artificial but have physical bodies C op y r i gh t 2022 b y H u m an F a c t o r s and E r gono m i cs S o c i e t y . A ll r i gh t s r e s e r v ed . 10 . 1177 / 1071181322661383 Proceedings of the 2022 HFES 66th International Annual Meeting 1096 instead of being contained within a screen . Examples of embodied agents include everything from telepresence robots to humanoid robots , such as Sophia from Hanson Robots , and machine - like robots like Baxter . There is evidence that user task performance is enhanced when interacting with collocated robots . Users report that embodied , collocated robots are more persuasive and perceived more favorably than artificial agents ( Li , 2015 ) . As negotiation agents are utilized as teaching tools for instilling negotiation practice and knowledge , the question remains whether negotiation agents are the correct modality through which to teach negotiation . This complexity is illuminated when considering that real - life negotiations are multi - stage , long - term interactions that are sensitive to emotional expression . Although negotiation AI frameworks are a promising platform to simulate negotiations and train humans to become better negotiators , there should be some worry that the results of this training may not translate into F2F negotiations with other human beings due to the discrepancy between negotiation environment , partner , and their combined effects on human behavior . When coupled with a virtual agent , questions are raised regarding the effectiveness of CMC negotiations for training humans . Research has begun evaluating the efficacy of embodied agent negotiators in situations similar to those examined with virtual agent collaborators ( Aydoğan , Keskin , & Çakan , 2021 ) . In addition to embodied agent negotiation partners , Aydoğan et al . ( 2018 ) have implemented speech as the medium of communication during the negotiation as a step towards creating realistic negotiations . While this research has found several exciting outcomes , there has yet to be any research examining differences in outcomes and human perception between virtual agents and embodied agent negotiations . Additionally , there is a need to research the role of agent nonverbal cue recognition and its effects on negotiation outcomes . Conducting research to address these gaps in knowledge is essential towards designing optimal negotiation simulations for both virtual and embodied agents . STUDY PROPOSAL We believe that embodied agent negotiation simulation is a path to more accurately model human nonverbal behaviors in simulated negotiation training with an agent . An interaction with an embodied agent may model a F2F negotiation more accurately , and interaction with a virtual agent may be more representative of a CMC negotiation . By examining nonverbal cues in embodied and virtual agents , we believe these simulations will become more accurate . In this way , we can better prepare people who are using negotiation simulations to become aware of the behavioral cues that are prevalent in F2F and CMC negotiations . This proposed study will attempt to find differences in human nonverbal behaviors when interacting with either an embodied agent or a virtual agent . This is to see if the agent type impacts the way that humans interact with the agent and to compare to human - to - human interactions both from F2F and CMC perspectives . This has broader implications when it comes to using virtual or embodied agents for training negotiation tactics . Hypothesis We propose a study that aims to determine differences in nonverbal behaviors of human users in simulated negotiations between an embodied agent and a virtual agent . Our hypothesis for this proposed study is the following : H1 : Human nonverbal communication behaviors and perception of agent abilities are moderated by the agent form ( Embodied v . Virtual ) Participants After running a power analysis on a two - tailed independent t - test for two samples with a moderate effect size , we aim to collect data on 128 participants from a northeastern university . With random sampling , we will gather an approximately equal number of males and females as well as hopefully obtain a sample of people that is proportionate to the racial makeup of the university . Materials The IAGO negotiation framework will be used as the virtual agent in this experiment . IAGO uses scripted interactions through a menu - based communication interface to simulate item partition negotiations . IAGO ' s interface includes a visual representation of the virtual agent that the participant is interacting with . The Furhat robot ( Figure 2 ) will be used as the embodied agent . The Furhat robot is shaped like a human head with a base that includes a camera . The Furhat head can be manipulated so that the display can reflect a realistic human face . A chair with Tekscan pressure sensors on the seat and backrest will be utilized to evaluate posture . Sensing sheets will be rendered in 8 - bit grey - scale images that can be interpreted through resistance to pressure from the sensors ( Mota & Picard , 2003 ) . The Tobii Eye Tracker 5 will be used to examine eye gaze along the length of the simulated negotiation . The Tobii is a black bar that is placed under a desktop screen that allows researchers to map areas of interest in the interface directly in front of them . An HD camera will be used to examine facial expressions in real - time . Measures Information regarding age , sex , and racial demographics would be collected . Participants will also be asked to fill out a form regarding their experience with job - related negotiations . Participants will be videotaped during their interaction with the negotiation AI and raters will determine the frequency of engaged facial expressions . Pressure - sensitive chairs will capture information regarding changes in posture throughout the interaction . Eye - tracking technology will capture where the participant is gazing to measure the frequency of " eye contact " with the negotiation AI . Method In this study , participants will be separated into two groups : negotiation with an embodied agent , or negotiation with a virtual agent . Participants will sign a consent form and then be briefed that they are to pretend that they are in an interview process where they must negotiate for a set of distinct items of different valuations . C op y r i gh t 2022 b y H u m an F a c t o r s and E r gono m i cs S o c i e t y . A ll r i gh t s r e s e r v ed . 10 . 1177 / 1071181322661383 Proceedings of the 2022 HFES 66th International Annual Meeting 1097 Figure 2 : Furhat This simulated negotiation will follow those conducted by IAGO and CaSiNo experiments , with the key change being that the items being negotiated will be related to ancillary job benefits ( PTO length , % of investment matched in 401K deposits , days working remote , health insurance benefits ) . The participant will then enter the study room and either be confronted with IAGO on a Window ' s Surface Pro , or a Furhat robot . The participant will interact with the Furhat robot via a Windows Surface Pro with a menu layout identical to that of the IAGO interface without the virtual agent . To maintain consistency in the method of interaction between the two different types of agents , the interactions for both agents in both studies will be scripted the same . To ensure that the differences between virtual and embodied agents is not due to some other morphological design , it is important to maintain the same degree of human likeness between the two types of agents . Participants will be filmed during the interaction and the results will be coded for pertinent nonverbal behaviors that map to task attentiveness and focus—e . g . facial expressions that show interest in the task , fixed eye gaze on collaborators , and upright posture . Nonverbal behaviors will be evaluated to determine if they are quantitatively different between the two collaborator groups . Participants will conduct all the key stages of a typical negotiation with the agent or robot until a ' resolution ' has been reached between both parties . Analysis A simple two - tailed independent t - test for two samples will be conducted to determine if there is a mean difference between nonverbal behaviors between the group that interacts with the embodied agent versus the group that interacts with the virtual agent . DISCUSSION Utilizing AI and Robotics to model human behavior has garnered significant research interest in the past 20 years . Negotiation AI frameworks are an extension of this line of research , focusing on simulating negotiation dynamics to enrich AI in human interactions , while also improving upon human competency during negotiations . Our project serves to advance the field of knowledge by examining the fluctuations in human performance and perception when the form of the collaborator in a negotiation changes . Modeling this difference would benefit the future of workplace negotiation training by informing future design decisions with regard to nonverbal behaviors and agent form . The importance of this line of the investigation comes from a need to understand the innate differences between how humans interact with virtual agents on a screen versus embodied agents . These two types of interactions may be analogous to human - to - human interaction which happens F2F or through CMC . By modeling differences in negotiation agent form , we are accounting for differences in human behavior when communicating in a virtual space compared to F2F models . There is currently a gap in the research regarding this specific issue and addressing these differences would not only assist humans by realistically modeling their behaviors in F2F job negotiations but also to examine how well current negotiation AI frameworks interpret and respond to human behaviors in negotiations compared to embodied , physical collocation . Future studies should focus on simulating performance when accounting for collaborator emotional recognition and emotional expression as well as communication modality ( menu , text , speech ) . This research will build upon our proposed study by introducing complex agent behaviors in simulated negotiations . By evaluating the effects of these complex behaviors on negotiation outcome as well as participant perception of task and self - reported skill development , we can inform future design decisions on the ideal negotiation agent that is both capable of replicating real - life negotiations while being a suitable teaching tool for novice negotiators .
