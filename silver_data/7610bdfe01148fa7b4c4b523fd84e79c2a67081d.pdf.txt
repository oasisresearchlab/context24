Interleukin ( IL ) - 8 – depen - dent neutrophil recruitment seems to play a critical role in the process of mechanical stress – induced airway inflammation . Herein , we show that human bronchial epithelial BEAS - 2B cells submitted to cyclic stretch in vitro produce IL - 8 , at both the mRNA and protein levels . This cellular stress “turns on” ac - tivator protein ( AP ) - 1 and cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - responding ele - ments . The mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinases ( MAPK ) p44 / 42 , SAPK / JNK , and p38 were all rapidly activated ( phos - phorylated ) after the initiation of the cyclic strain ( 5 – 10 min ) . The blockade of p38 with the pharmacologic inhibitor SB203580 abrogated IL - 8 production by cell stretching , and an inhibitor of the p44 / 42 pathway , PD98059 , partially inhibited the IL - 8 response . A nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor , genistein , also blocked the stretch - induced IL - 8 production . This sug - gests that MAPK , and p38 in particular , are proximal and key intracellular signaling molecules mediating cell activation in response to cyclic stretch , a mechanical strain similar to that applied to lung epithelial cells during mechanical ventilation . Pharmacologic inhibition of the p38 pathway holds promise as a new therapeutic avenue in ventilated patients . Cells of the respiratory tract are submitted to normal cy - clic stretch during tidal respiration . In some situations , such as positive pressure mechanical ventilation or during severe asthma attacks , bronchial and / or alveolar cells can be elongated to supranormal values , a condition referred to as overstretching ( 1 ) . This has been proposed as a possi - ble mechanism for cell activation ( 2 ) , and may participate in the pathogenesis of ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) ( 2 – 4 ) or in the bronchial inflammation during acute severe asthma . It was recently demonstrated that cyclic stretch in - duced several proinflammatory genes both in animals ( 5 – 7 ) and in vitro experiments ( 8 , 9 ) . Among these , the che - mokine interleukin ( IL ) - 8 is particularly relevant , because in humans it represents the major chemoattractant for neutrophils , and neutrophil recruitment to the airways is a critical step in the pathogenesis of VILI ( 10 ) . The likely cellular sources of IL - 8 in the lung are the respiratory epi - thelium ( 8 , 9 ) and the alveolar macrophage ( 8 ) . Fibro - blasts , smooth muscle cells , and capillary endothelial cells are also candidates for the stretched - induced IL - 8 secre - tion , although this could not be confirmed in in vitro ex - periments ( 11 ) . In response to proinflammatory stimuli , the IL - 8 production is dependent on at least three signal - ing pathways : mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinases ( MAPK ) , nuclear factor ( NF ) - (cid:2) B , and NF – IL - 6 pathways ( 12 ) , but the precise molecular mechanisms by which IL - 8 is activated in response to cell stretching remain not com - pletely understood . In this study , we set up an in vitro model of cyclic stretch – induced IL - 8 production by human bronchial epithelial BEAS - 2B cells . Using this model , we investigated various signaling pathways and found that IL - 8 secretion induced by cyclic stretch was a transcriptional effect and that MAPK played a pivotal role . Materials and Methods Cells Several human epithelial cell lines were initially screened for IL - 8 production in response to cell stretching . Human bronchial epi - thelial BEAS - 2B cells ( ATCC number CRL - 9609 [ Rockville , MD ] ) were chosen , because they consistently produced IL - 8 in response to cell stretch , and because they were derived from pri - mary bronchial cells and immortalized using SV40 , rather than originating from undifferentiated lung carcinoma . These cells have kept many features of the primary bronchial epithelial cells ( 13 ) . BEAS - 2B cells were cultured in a 50 / 50 mixture of Dul - becco’s modified Eagle’s medium , and F - 12 nutrient mixture sup - plemented with 10 % FCS , 2 mM L - glutamine , 10 mM HEPES ( Life Technologies , Paisley , Scotland , UK ) , 50 U / ml penicillin , and 2 (cid:3) g / ml gentamycin ( Garamycin ; Essex Chemie AG , Luc - erne , Switzerland ) . Stably transfected BEAS - 2B cells were cul - tured in the same medium supplemented with 150 (cid:3) g / ml Hygro - mycin B ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) . Cell Transfection Several cell lines derived from BEAS - 2B cells were established by stable transfection of artificial promoter constructs of consen - sus sequences of responding elements of classic transcription fac - tors controlling inflammatory genes . BEAS - 2B cells were trans - fected with tandem repeats of NF - (cid:2) B , activator - protein ( AP ) - 1 , glucocorticoid receptor – responding element ( GRE ) , cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - responding element ( CRE ) , and heat - shock – responding element ( HSE ) ( Mercury Pathway Profiling Luciferase System ; Clontech ) driving a firefly luciferase gene . The sequences of the synthetic promoters are shown in Table 1 . Cells were cotransfected with a pHygEGFP vector ( Clontech ) for selection . One stable cell line was established for each pro - moter construct . Cell sorting by flow cytometry using the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) was used to obtain similar expression levels in all cell lines .

Positive controls consisted of cells in static conditions in - cubated with specific agonists : tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - (cid:4) for NF - (cid:2) B , phorbol ester ( PMA ) for AP - 1 , dexamethasone for GRE , isoprenalin for CRE , and heat shock ( 42 (cid:5) C for 30 min ) for HSE . Stretched and control cells were lysed and cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using Promega’s Luciferase Assay System protocol ( Madison , WI ) . Luciferase activity was normal - ized for the protein concentration of the lysate . Mechanical Stretch Native or transfected BEAS - 2B cells were seeded on collagen I – coated 6 - well BioFlex silastic - bottom culture plate ( Flexcell International Corp . , Hillsborough , NC ) at the concentration of 1 . 5 (cid:6) 10 5 cells / well . Cells were grown in a 5 % CO 2 incubator at 37 (cid:5) C for 48 – 72 h in the BioFlex plates until a single - cell mono - layer confluence was achieved . Plates were then transferred to the baseplate of the cell stretching device FX - 3000 Flexercell strain unit ( Flexcell International ) , and placed in a 37 (cid:5) C , 5 % CO 2 incu - bator . Before stretching , the culture medium was changed with fresh medium . Cells were stretched using the following proto - col : stretching rate of 20 cycles / min with a square signal , a 1 : 1 stretch : relaxation ratio , and a 20 % maximal equibiaxial elonga - tion , in most of the experiments . In some experiments , cells were submitted to 5 , 10 , and 20 % maximal equibiaxial elongation . Control cells were cultured in BioFlex plates but not submitted to cell stretch ( static condition ) . Cells and / or supernatants were harvested after various times , and processed immediately . Cell viability was assessed using a classic DNA - binding propidium io - dide ( PI ; BD Pharmingen , San Jose , CA ) staining , with detection of PI - negative living / PI - positive dead cells using flow cytometry . Cell viability was not found to be influenced by cell stretching up to 20 % of elongation . In some experiments , protein kinase inhibitors or their dilu - ent ( DMSO ) were added to the cells 30 min before cell stretch - ing . These included the nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein used at 50 (cid:3) M ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , a specific p38 in - hibitor ( SB 203580 , 1 (cid:3) M , Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) , and a specific MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor ( PD 98059 , 25 (cid:3) M , upstream of p44 / 42 MAPK ; Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) . In other experiments , the inhibitor of transcription actinomycin D ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml ; Sigma ) was added to the cells either 30 min before ( measurement of the IL - 8 protein ) or 2 h after ( measurement of IL - 8 mRNA by RNase protection assay [ RPA ] ) the beginning of cell stretching . IL - 8 Protein Levels in Supernatants Cell - free supernatants from control and stretched BEAS - 2B were harvested and stored at (cid:7) 20 (cid:5) C until assayed . In some ex - periments , cells were lysed in a Tris - buffered saline containing 1 % Triton - X100 , glycerol , antiproteases , and EDTA . Levels of IL - 8 in supernatants and in cell lysates were determined by a sandwich ELISA using paired monoclonal antibodies ( Endogen , Woburn , MA ) as described by the manufacturer . Maximal levels of cyclic stretch – induced IL - 8 may vary between experiments . However , the ratio of induced IL - 8 / baseline IL - 8 remained very similar from one experiment to the other , which allowed compar - ison between experiments . RNA Extraction and RNase Protection Assay Control or stretch BEAS - 2B cells were lysed after various times in 500 (cid:3) l Trizol / well ( Life Technologies ) . Total RNA was ex - tracted and resuspended in DEPC - H 2 O . Five micrograms of total RNA per condition were used for RPA analyses . The IL - 8 probe protected the complete ORF of the IL - 8 mRNA ( 300 nucle - otides ) and was kindly provided by C . Power ( Serono Interna - tional SA , Plan - les - Ouates , Geneva , Switzerland ) . The glyceral - dehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) probe protected 100 nucleotides ( positions 67 – 166 of the mRNA ) and was ob - tained from USB ( Cleveland , OH ) . Radiolabeled riboprobes were obtained by the transcription of the DNA templates using [ (cid:4) - 32 P ] UTP and the T7 RNA polymerase according to the manu - facturer’s protocol ( Promega ) . Total RNA / riboprobe mixtures were digested with A and T1 RNases at 30 (cid:5) C for 30 min . Di - gested RNA mixtures were run on urea gels as previously de - scribed ( 14 ) . Dried gels were submitted to autoradiography and PhosphorImager ( Amersham Bioscience , Sunnyvale , CA ) . The in - tensity of the protected bands was quantified using the ImageQuant software ( Amersham Bioscience ) . The level of the IL - 8 mRNA was defined as the intensity of the IL - 8 – protected band divided by the intensity of the GAPDH - protected band . Western Blot BEAS - 2B cells were submitted to cell stretching for 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , and 60 min . Stretched BEAS - 2B and control cells were lysed di - rectly into 100 (cid:3) l / well of SDS sample buffer containing 62 . 5 mM pH 6 . 8 Tris - HCl , 2 % SDS , 25 % glycerol , and 0 . 01 % bromophe - nol blue . Twenty microliters of cell extract were loaded onto 10 % SDS - PAGE , and proteins were electrotransferred to polyvi - nylidene difluoride membranes ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Mem - branes were immunoblotted with 1 / 1 , 000 dilution of anti – phos - pho - MAPK antibodies ( anti – phospho - p38 , anti – phospho - p44 / 42 MAPK , and anti – phospho - SAPK / JNK were from Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA ) and a 1 / 2 , 000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase – conjugated secondary antibody ( Cell Signaling Tech - nology ) in nonfat dry milk - or BSA - based incubation buffers , ac - cording to the manufacturer’s recommendations . Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Sunnyvale , CA ) and autoradiography . Mem - branes were then submitted to a stripping protocol by incubation for 30 min at 52 (cid:5) C in a buffer containing 62 . 5 mM pH 6 . 8 TRIS - HCL , SDS 2 % , and 100 mM (cid:8) - mercaptoethanol , and reprobed using anti - “total” MAPK antibodies ( anti - SAPK / JNK and p44 / 42 MAPK from Cell Signaling Technology , and anti - p38 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) . Second steps and detection were the same as described above .

This was accompanied by an in - crease in IL - 8 cellular mRNA levels as determined by RNase protection assay ( Figure 1C ) . The levels of GAPDH mRNA were not modified by cell stretching ( results not shown ) . After 8 h of cyclic stretch , IL - 8 levels were not found to be different in cell lysates from cells submitted to stretch compared with static controls ( 0 . 8 (cid:9) 0 . 1 versus 0 . 7 (cid:9) 0 . 1 ng / (cid:3) g protein of cell lysate , respectively ) , whereas IL - 8 significantly increased in the supernatants of the same cells submitted to stretch ( 1 . 4 (cid:9) 0 . 1 versus 0 . 7 (cid:9) 0 . 1 ng / ml ) . Both the IL - 8 protein and the IL - 8 mRNA induced by cell stretching were completely inhibited by the presence of Actinomycin D ( Figure 2 ) , suggesting an activation of IL - 8 gene transcription by cyclic stretch . Importantly , the concentration of Actinomycin D ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml ) used in these experiments was not toxic for the cells as determined using a cell viability MTT assay ( data not shown ) ( 15 ) , and was comparable to that used by others ( 16 ) . These experiments highly suggest a transcriptional control of the IL - 8 gene by cyclic stretch . Signaling Pathways Activated by Cell Stretching To screen for various signaling pathways that may be in - duced by cell stretching , different BEAS - 2B cell lines were established by stable transfection of inducible luciferase under the control of consensus promoter constructs . As shown in Figure 3 , all these synthetic promoters were func - tional as determined by their response to specific agonists , but only AP - 1 – and cAMP - responding elements were acti - vated by cyclic stretch . A time course ( 2 , 4 , 8 , and 24 h ) was performed with cells transfected with the NF - (cid:2) B tan - dem repeats . Whereas TNF - (cid:4) induced a significant luciferase activity already after 2 h , stretch did not activate NF - (cid:2) B with this reporter assay throughout the experiment . Inhibition of IL - 8 Secretion by Inhibitors of Kinases To investigate potential pathways activated by cyclic stretch , we first used a nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibi - tor , genistein , which abolished the IL - 8 secretion induced by cyclic stretch ( Figure 4 ) . Figure 1 . IL - 8 production by BEAS - 2B cells submitted to cyclic stretch . ( A ) IL - 8 protein concentration in supernatants from cells submitted to 5 , 10 , and 20 % stretch for 8 and 24 h .

The results presented in each panel are represen - tative of three separate experiments . 110 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOL . 27 2002 Because AP - 1 is controlled by stress MAPK ( 17 ) , and seemed to be activated by cyclic stretch , and because MAPK are known to be downstream of tyrosine kinases , we next tested the potential role of MAPK in stretch - induced IL - 8 production . We initially tested the effect of two specific MAPK inhibitors : SB 203580 ( p38 inhibitor ) and PD 98059 ( inhibitor of MEK1 / 2 upstream of p44 / 42 MAPK ) on stretch - induced increase of IL - 8 protein secretion and on IL - 8 mRNA cellular contents . Cells were harvested af - ter 2 , 5 , and 8 h , and supernatants were collected after 8 h of cell stretching . SB 203580 , but not the DMSO diluent , completely prevented the increase of IL - 8 secretion in - duced by cyclic stretch ( Figure 4 ) . PD 98059 consistently decreased the secretion of IL - 8 induced by cyclic stretch by 70 % ( Figure 4 ) . Neither SB 203580 nor PD 98059 had any effect on cell viability , as measured by an MTT assay ( data not shown ) . To further evaluate the possible role of MAP kinases on IL - 8 transcription , we tested the effects of these two inhibitors on stretch - induced IL - 8 mRNA levels determined by RPA . We found that SB 203580 al - most totally prevented the increase in IL - 8 mRNA in - duced by cyclic stretch ( Figure 5 ) . PD 98059 did not have a significant effect on IL - 8 mRNA levels induced by stretch as shown in Figure 5 . MAPK Phosphorylation Induced by Cell Stretching We further investigated whether stretch did induce MAPK phosphorylation , a step necessary for MAPK activation . This was done by the detection of phosphorylated forms of MAPK by Western blot using specific phospho - MAPK antibodies . Cyclic stretch of BEAS - 2B cells resulted in a rapid and specific phosphorylation of all MAPK tested ( p44 / 42 MAPK , p38 , and SAPK / JNK ) ( Figure 6 ) . Phos - pho - MAPK were detected after 5 min of cell stretching ( p38 ) and 10 min for p44 / 42 MAPK and SAPK / JNK . Phos - pho - p38 peaked at 10 min and then decreased and was nearly undetectable at 60 min . Phospho - p44 / 42 MAPK and phospho - SAPK / JNK peaked at 20 min , and remained detectable at 60 min . Unphosphorylated MAPK bands were similar in stretched and unstretched cells ( Figure 6 ) . Figure 3 . Activation of various responding elements by cyclic stretch . BEAS - 2B cell lines were established by transfection of various tandem repeats of responding elements : NF - (cid:2) B , AP - 1 , cyclic AMP ( CRE ) , heat shock ( HSE ) , and glucocorticoid ( GRE ) responding elements driving a luciferase reporter gene . Upper panel : cells were submitted to cyclic stretch ( striped bars ) or kept in static conditions ( open bars ) for 4 h , and then lysed . Luciferase activity was then measured and reported as fold in - duction compared with static conditions for each cell line . Lower p anel : each cell line was incubated for 4 h with specific agonists ( striped bars ) to demonstrate the inducibility of the promoter constructs . The following agonists were used : recombinant hu - man TNF - (cid:4) ( 10 ng / ml ) for NF - (cid:2) B ; PMA ( 200 ng / ml ) for AP - 1 ; isoprenalin ( 10 (cid:7) 6 M ) for CRE ; 42 (cid:5) C heat shock during 30 min for HSE ; and dexamethasone ( 1 (cid:3) g / ml ) for GRE .

Results are expressed as mean (cid:9) SEM of three different experiments . Oudin and Pugin : MAPK Activation by Cellular Stretch 111 Discussion Lung neutrophilic inflammation is a hallmark of the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , VILI , and acute severe asthma ( ASA ) ( 18 – 21 ) . Overstretching of airways is believed to play an important pathogenic role in these conditions , and the degree of airway distention conditions the recruitment of neutrophils . During VILI , the chemo - kine IL - 8 is responsible in great part for the recruitment of blood neutrophils to the airspace ( 2 , 3 , 20 ) . IL - 8 secretion by lung macrophages , human alveolar type II – like A549 cells , and endothelial cell submitted in vitro to cyclic cell stretching has been reported by several groups ( 8 , 9 , 11 , 22 , 23 ) . However , the mechanisms of the IL - 8 production remained to be determined . Herein , we show that cell stretch - ing of human bronchial epithelial cells results in an increase in IL - 8 mRNA expression , and IL - 8 protein secretion , and that this process is dependent on MAPK activation . The degree of lung epithelial cell stretching in patients submitted to mechanical ventilation is largely unknown , particularly in patients with diseased lungs , or with hyper - inflation due to bronchospasm . Using in vitro models , sev - eral investigators have attempted to quantify the elonga - tion factor of cells from alveoli , alveolar ducts , or bronchioles in response to variation of lung volumes ( 24 , 25 ) . The alve - olar surface area was quantified in animal isolated lungs by both light and electron microscopy techniques ( 24 – 26 ) . Changes in lung volumes from 40 % of the total lung ca - pacity ( TLC ) to 80 % of the TLC were associated with variations of 8 – 28 % of the alveolar surface area , which corresponded to alveolar cell elongation factors of 3 . 6 – 12 . 5 % , respectively , assuming that the alveolus is perfectly spherical . Inflating isolated rat lungs from residual capac - ity to 80 and 100 % of the TLC resulted in increased alveo - lar surface areas of 25 – 37 % , which translated into clini - cally relevant transpulmonary pressures ( 12 and 25 cm H 2 O , respectively ) ( 24 , 27 ) . The alveolar stretching factors studied in isolated lungs were somewhat smaller than the cell elongation factor most frequently used in our study ( 20 % ) . However , a 10 % elongation factor , more compati - ble with these morphometric studies , also induced bron - chial cells to release IL - 8 in our in vitro model . The cell type used in our studies is derived from human bronchial cells . Interestingly , Goldstein and coworkers found bronchiolar dilatation in diseased areas of infected pig lungs submitted to mechanical ventilation ( 26 ) . The transverse section area of bronchioles contained in consol - idated parenchyma and measured by light microscopy was increased by 100 % when compared with unaffected re - gions ( 26 ) . Assuming that bronchioles are cylinders , such a degree of distention translates into a 41 % elongation fac - tor . However , this represents a static measurement , and the degree of stretch of these structures during tidal venti - lation is unknown . Yager and colleagues measured the elongation of various parenchymal structures in lungs from dogs and humans submitted to isotropic biaxial stretch in vitro corresponding roughly to tidal breathing . They found that alveolar ducts stretched more than the rest of the pa - renchyma by a factor of 3 . 8 % in humans and 10 . 3 % in dogs , suggesting that small tubular airway structures may well be submitted to overstretching ( 28 ) .

Phosphorylation of the MAPK was detected by immunoblot on cell lysates using antibodies specific to the phosphorylated forms of the kinases ( phospho - MAPK , upper panels ) . Equal loading of cell lysates was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of MAPK ( lower panels ) . The results presented here correspond to a repre - sentative experiment out of three similar experiments . 112 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOL . 27 2002 In our model of cyclic bronchial cell stretching , IL - 8 was released in a dose - dependent manner by cells submit - ted to 5 , 10 , and 20 % stretching . The elongation factor used in most of our cyclic cell stretching experiments was 20 % . This level of cell elongation was chosen because it in - duced a maximal IL - 8 production and did not affect cell vi - ability . Tschumperlin and Margulies had previously shown that stretch - induced loss of plasma membrane integrity in alveolar type II cells and secondary cell death were depen - dent on the elongation factor , the time during which the cells were kept adherent on the silicone membrane , and the seeding density ( 27 ) . The authors concluded that type II cells in culture acquired stretch resistance due to type I – like phenotypic changes ( 27 ) . Elongation factors of 20 – 30 % were also commonly used by many investigators in in vitro models of lung cell stretching ( 9 , 29 – 32 ) . Neverthe - less , extrapolation of these in vitro studies to human physi - ology and pathology requires great care . IL - 8 production in response to proinflammatory stimuli is generally regulated both at transcriptional and post - tran - scriptional levels ( 33 ) . Our data , essentially based on acti - nomycin D experiments , strongly suggest that cell stretching induces IL - 8 transcription . However , one cannot exclude an additional stabilizing effect of stretch on IL - 8 mRNA ( 12 , 34 ) . IL - 8 transcription has been shown to be under the control of various signaling pathways . These include NF - (cid:2) B , AP - 1 , and NF – IL - 6 ( 12 , 33 ) . Using artificial promoter constructs , we could show that at least two classic respond - ing elements were activated by cyclic stretch : AP - 1 and CRE . These results should , however , be taken with caution , because the levels of induction of the reporter gene were low , as compared with natural agonists . In addition , the use of synthetic tandem repeats of responding elements also has limitations in that they do not allow cooperation of dif - ferent transcription factors , frequently required for effi - cient gene transcription . Both AP - 1 – and cAMP – responding elements bind dimers of basic leucin zipper family proteins , downstream targets of MAPK , such as c - jun , c - fos , and transcription factors of the ATF / CREB family ( 17 , 35 – 37 ) . This is consistent with the report of Du and coworkers . These authors reported activation of AP - 1 , CRE , and NF - (cid:2) B in endothelial cells submitted to cyclic strain . Whereas AP - 1 and NF - (cid:2) B sites have been identified in the 5 (cid:11) region of the human IL - 8 gene , CRE is not found in this promoter . Glucocorticoid - and heat shock – responding elements , which have not been described in the promoter region of IL - 8 , nor linked with mechanical stress - induced cell activation , were not turned on in our study . NF - (cid:2) B had been previously shown to be activated by cyclic stretch in an in vitro model of stretched macrophages ( 8 ) , as well as in animals submitted to injuri - ous ventilatory regimen ( 5 ) . Using a synthetic promoter construct of tandem repeats of a consensus sequence for NF - (cid:2) B , we did not observe increased luciferase activity af - ter cell stretching . This could be explained by different pathways of cell activation in macrophages versus epithe - lial cells , as nicely demonstrated for endothelial cells , which show divergent transcription factor activation to cy - clic strain depending on the vascular bed origin ( 38 ) . An - other possibility is that nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF - (cid:2) B was not sufficient for gene transcription . Indeed , a critical phosphoinositide - 3 kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt - dependent nuclear phosphorylation of p65 is required to confer its transcriptional activity ( 39 , 40 ) . Therefore , cyclic stretch may induce the initial NF - (cid:2) B activation and nu - clear translocation , but not the secondary p65 phosphory - lation . Alternatively , NF - (cid:2) B may be activated but require other transcription factors to cooperate with to turn on in - flammatory genes ( 41 ) . The finding that AP - 1 was activated by cyclic stretch prompted us to investigate the role of MAPK in the signal transduction pathway induced by cyclic stretch . MAPK of the three subclasses , p44 / 42 , JNK , and p38 , were strongly activated as shown by the rapid and sustained phosphoryla - tion of these proteins upon cell stretching . Similar findings were recently reported by Sawada and colleagues . These authors showed that MAPK were activated by cyclic stretch in human embryonic kidney ( 293 ) cells and in mouse L929 fibroblasts ( 42 ) . More importantly , specific inhibitors of MAPK or of upstream kinases were able to block the cell stretch - IL - 8 production , both at the mRNA and at the pro - tein level . The p38 inhibitor SB203580 abrogated the IL - 8 signal , whereas an inhibitor of MEK1 / 2 a MAPK kinase up - stream of p44 / p42 MAPK only partially inhibited IL - 8 pro - duction . We were not able to test JNK pharmacologic in - hibitors because such compounds are not commercially available . This strongly suggested a prominent role of MAPK , and particularly of p38 , in controlling IL - 8 expression in re - sponse to mechanical stress in bronchial epithelial cells . In - terestingly , p38 activation was recently implicated in IL - 8 mRNA stabilization ( 12 , 34 ) . This stabilizing effect may well participate in the observed increase in IL - 8 production by BEAS - 2B cells submitted to cell stretching . Importantly , p38 was already implicated in the IL - 8 production by lung cells with cell stimulation other than cell stretching ( proin - flammatory cytokines , rhinoviruses , and hyperosmolarity ) ( 43 – 45 ) . The phosphorylation and the activation of p38 by cyclic stretch could be the consequence of the activation of Rap - 1 , a small G - protein upstream of MAPKKK and MEK1 / 6 ( 42 ) . Whether this protein participates directly to the mechanosensing apparatus remains to be determined . Activation of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) has been re - ported by several groups in response to shear stress and cy - clic stretch in various cell types ( 46 , 47 ) . This may represent one of the very proximal steps of cellular mechanosensing as well as be responsible for the activation of the Grb2 / Sos / Ras pathway . Whereas it seems that Ras is activated by shear stress ( 48 ) , Ras activation in response to cyclic stretch has been found inconsistently ( 42 , 49 ) . In endothelial cells , both PI3K - dependent and - independent pathways of Ras activation have been described ( 48 ) . Cell stretch is a me - chanical strain which resembles that of shear stress , and certainly shares similar activation and signaling pathways ( 4 , 46 ) . The role of calcium and inositol phosphates which was not studied here may also play a role in the mecha - nosensing and in the activation process of cells submitted to both types of mechanical strains ( 50 , 51 ) . A scheme ( Figure 7 ) illustrates our current hypotheses of the molecular mech - anisms responsible for IL - 8 production in bronchial cells submitted to cyclic stretch . In conclusion , we show that cyclic stretch of human bronchial epithelial cells induces IL - 8 secretion in a MAPK - Oudin and Pugin : MAPK Activation by Cellular Stretch 113 dependent manner . The p38 kinase is rapidly activated af - ter initiation of cyclic stretch , and seems to play a crucial role , because its pharmacologic blockade abrogates IL - 8 production . p38 inhibitors may therefore represent a prom - ising therapeutic strategy in lung inflammatory diseases where airway overdistention occurs .
