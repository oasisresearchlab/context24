Little is known about factors that induce this reprogramming . Here , we dem - onstrate induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic or adult ﬁbroblasts by introducing four factors , Oct3 / 4 , Sox2 , c - Myc , and Klf4 , under ES cell culture conditions . Unexpectedly , Nanog was dispensable . These cells , which we designated iPS ( induced plurip - otent stem ) cells , exhibit the morphology and growth properties of ES cells and express ES cell marker genes . Subcutaneous transplanta - tion of iPS cells into nude mice resulted in tumors containing a variety of tissues from all three germ layers . Following injection into blas - tocysts , iPS cells contributed to mouse embry - onic development . These data demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells can be directly gen - erated from ﬁbroblast cultures by the addition of only a few deﬁned factors . INTRODUCTION Embryonic stem ( ES ) cells , which are derived from the in - ner cell mass of mammalian blastocysts , have the ability to grow indeﬁnitely while maintaining pluripotency and the ability to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers ( Evans and Kaufman , 1981 ; Martin , 1981 ) . Human ES cells might be used to treat a host of diseases , such as Parkin - son’s disease , spinal cord injury , and diabetes ( Thomson et al . , 1998 ) . However , there are ethical difﬁculties regard - ing the use of human embryos , as well as the problem of tissue rejection following transplantation in patients . One way to circumvent these issues is the generation of plu - ripotent cells directly from the patients’ own cells . Somatic cells can be reprogrammed by transferring their nuclear contents into oocytes ( Wilmut et al . , 1997 ) or by fusion with ES cells ( Cowan et al . , 2005 ; Tada et al . , 2001 ) , indicating that unfertilized eggs and ES cells contain factors that can confer totipotency or pluripotency to somatic cells . We hypothesized that the factors that play important roles in the maintenance of ES cell identity also play pivotal roles in the induction of pluripotency in somatic cells . Several transcription factors , including Oct3 / 4 ( Nichols et al . , 1998 ; Niwa et al . , 2000 ) , Sox2 ( Avilion et al . , 2003 ) , and Nanog ( Chambers et al . , 2003 ; Mitsui et al . , 2003 ) , function in the maintenance of pluripotency in both early embryos and ES cells . Several genes that are frequently upregulated in tumors , such as Stat3 ( Matsuda et al . , 1999 ; Niwa et al . , 1998 ) , E - Ras ( Takahashi et al . , 2003 ) , c - myc ( Cartwright et al . , 2005 ) , Klf4 ( Li et al . , 2005 ) , and b - catenin ( Kielman et al . , 2002 ; Sato et al . , 2004 ) , have been shown to contribute to the long - term maintenance of the ES cell phenotype and the rapid proliferation of ES cells in culture . In addition , we have identiﬁed several other genes that are speciﬁcally expressed in ES cells ( Maruyama et al . , 2005 ; Mitsui et al . , 2003 ) . In this study , we examined whether these factors could induce pluripotency in somatic cells . By combining four selected factors , we were able to generate pluripotent cells , which we call induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells , directly from mouse embryonic or adult ﬁbroblast cul - tures . RESULTS We selected 24 genes as candidates for factors that induce pluripotency in somatic cells , based on our hypothesis that such factors also play pivotal roles in the maintenance of ES cell identity ( see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . For b - catenin , c - Myc , and Stat3 , we used active forms , S33Y - b - catenin ( Sadot et al . , 2002 ) , T58A - c - Myc ( Chang et al . , 2000 ) , and Stat3 - C ( Bromberg et al . , 1999 ) , respec - tively . Because of the reported negative effect of Grb2 on pluripotency ( Burdon et al . , 1999 ; Cheng et al . , 1998 ) , we included its dominant - negative mutant Grb2 D SH2 ( Miyamoto et al . , 2004 ) as 1 of the 24 candidates . Cell 126 , 663 – 676 , August 25 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . 663 To evaluate these 24 candidate genes , we developed an assay system in which the induction of the pluripotent state could be detected as resistance to G418 ( Figure 1A ) . We inserted a b geo cassette ( a fusion of the b - galactosi - dase and neomycin resistance genes ) into the mouse Fbx15 gene by homologous recombination ( Tokuzawa et al . , 2003 ) . Although speciﬁcally expressed in mouse ES cells and early embryos , Fbx15 is dispensable for the maintenance of pluripotency and mouse development . ES cells homozygous for the b geo knockin construct ( Fbx15 b geo / b geo ) were resistant to extremely high concen - trations of G418 ( up to 12 mg / ml ) , whereas somatic cells derived from Fbx15 b geo / b geo mice were sensitive to a nor - mal concentration of G418 ( 0 . 3 mg / ml ) . We expected that even partial activation of the Fbx15 locus would result in resistance to normal concentrations of G418 . We introduced each of the 24 candidate genes into mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) from Fbx15 b geo / b geo Figure 1 .

Transduced cells were then cultured on STO feeder cells in ES cell medium containing G418 ( 0 . 3 mg / ml ) . We did not , however , obtain drug - resistant colonies with any sin - gle factor , indicating that no single candidate gene was sufﬁcient to activate the Fbx15 locus ( Figure 1B ; see also Table S2 , which summarizes all of the transduction experiments in this study ) . In contrast , transduction of all 24 candidates together generated 22 G418 - resistant colonies ( Figure 1B ) . Of the 12 clones for which we continued cultivating under selec - tion , 5 clones exhibited morphology similar to ES cells , including a round shape , large nucleoli , and scant cyto - plasm ( Figure 1C ) . We repeated the experiments and ob - served 29 G418 - resistant colonies , from which we picked 6 colonies . Four of these clones possessed ES cell - like morphology and proliferation properties ( Figure 1D ) . The doubling time of these cells ( 19 . 4 , 17 . 5 , 18 . 7 , and 18 . 6 hr ) was equivalent to that of ES cells ( 17 . 0 hr ) . We desig - nated these cells iPS - MEF24 for ‘‘pluripotent stem cells in - duced from MEFs by 24 factors . ’’ Reverse transcription PCR ( RT - PCR ) analysis revealed that the iPS - MEF24 clones expressed ES cell markers , including Oct3 / 4 , Nanog , E - Ras , Cripto , Dax1 , and Zfp296 ( Mitsui et al . , 2003 ) and Fgf4 ( Yuan et al . , 1995 ) ( Figure 1E ) . Bisulﬁte genomic sequencing demonstrated that the promoters of Fbx15 and Nanog were demethylated in iPS cells ( Figure 1F ) . By contrast , the Oct3 / 4 promoter remained methylated in these cells . These data indicate that some combination of these 24 candidate factors induced the expression of ES cell marker genes in MEF culture . Next , to determine which of the 24 candidates were crit - ical , we examined the effect of withdrawal of individual factors from the pool of transduced candidate genes on the formation of G418 - resistant colonies ( Figure 2A ) . We identiﬁed 10 factors ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 18 , 20 , 21 , and 22 ) whose individual withdrawal from the bulk transduc - tion pool resulted in no colony formation 10 days after Figure 2 .

Combination of these 10 genes alone produced more ES cell - like colonies than transduction of all 24 genes did ( Figure 2B ) . We next examined the formation of colonies after with - drawal of individual factors from the 10 - factor pool trans - duced into MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . G418 - resistant colonies did not form when either Oct3 / 4 ( factor 14 ) or Klf4 ( factor 20 ) was removed . Removal of Sox2 ( factor 15 ) resulted in only a few G418 - resistant colonies . When we removed c - Myc ( factor 22 ) , G418 - resistant colonies did emerge , but these had a ﬂatter , non - ES - cell - like morphology . Re - moval of the remaining factors did not signiﬁcantly affect colony numbers . These results indicate that Oct3 / 4 , Klf4 , Sox2 , and c - Myc play important roles in the generation of iPS cells from MEFs . Combination of the four genes produced a number of G418 - resistant colonies similar to that observed with the pool of 10 genes ( Figure 2C ) . We continued cultivation of 12 clones for each transduction and were able to establish 4 iPS - MEF4 and 5 iPS - MEF10 clones . In addition , we could generate iPS cells ( iPS - MEF4wt ) with wild - type c - Myc instead of the T58A mutant ( Table S2 ) . These data demonstrate that iPS cells can be induced from MEF culture by the introduction of four transcription factors , Oct3 / 4 , Sox2 , c - Myc , and Klf4 . No combination of two factors could induce the forma - tion of G418 - resistant colonies ( Figure 2C ) . Two combina - tions of three factors—Oct3 / 4 , Sox2 , and c - Myc ( minus Klf4 ) or Klf4 , Sox2 , and c - Myc ( minus Oct3 / 4 ) —generated a single , small colony in each case , but these could not be maintained in culture . With the combination of Oct3 / 4 , Klf4 , and Sox2 ( minus c - Myc ) , we observed the formation of 36 G418 - resistant colonies , which , however , exhibited a ﬂat , non - ES - cell - like morphology . With the combination of Oct3 / 4 , Klf4 , and c - Myc ( minus Sox2 ) , we observed the formation of 54 G418 - resistant colonies , of which we picked 6 . Although all 6 clones could be maintained over several passages , the morphology of these cells ( iPS - MEF3 ) differed from that of iPS - MEF4 and iPS - MEF10 cells , with iPS - MEF3 colonies exhibiting rough surfaces ( Figure 2D ) . These data indicate that the combination of Oct3 / 4 , c - Myc , and Klf4 can activate the Fbx15 locus , but the change induced by these three factors alone is dif - ferent from that seen in iPS - MEF4 or iPS - MEF10 cells . We performed RT - PCR to examine whether ES cell marker genes were expressed in iPS cells ( Figure 3A ) . We used primers that would amplify transcripts of the en - dogenous gene but not transcripts of the transgene . iPS - MEF10 and iPS - MEF4 clones expressed the majority of marker genes , with the exception of Ecat1 ( Mitsui et al . , 2003 ) . The expression of several marker genes , including Oct3 / 4 , was higher in iPS - MEF4 - 7 , iPS - MEF10 - 6 , and iPS - MEF10 - 7 clones than in the remaining clones . Sox2 was only expressed in iPS - MEF10 - 6 . The iPS - MEF4wt clone also expressed many of the ES cell marker genes ( Figure S1 ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that the promoters of Oct3 / 4 and Nanog had increased acetylation of histone H3 and decreased dimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 ( Figure 3B ) . CpG dinucleotides in these promoters remained partially methylated in iPS cells ( Figure 3C ) . iPS - MEF4 and iPS - MEF10 cells were positive for alkaline phosphatase and SSEA - 1 ( Figure 3D ) and showed high telomerase activity ( Figure S2 ) . These results demonstrate that iPS - MEF4 and iPS - MEF10 cells are similar , but not identical , to ES cells . In iPS - MEF3 clones , Ecat1 , Esg1 , and Sox2 were not activated ( Figure 3A ) . Nanog was induced , but to a lesser extent than in iPS - MEF4 and iPS - MEF10 clones . Oct3 / 4 was weakly activated in iPS - MEF3 - 3 , - 5 , and - 6 but was not activated in the remaining clones . By contrast , E - Ras and Fgf4 were activated more efﬁciently in iPS - MEF3 than in iPS - MEF10 or iPS - MEF4 . These data conﬁrm that iPS - MEF3 cells are substantially different from iPS - MEF10 and iPS - MEF4 cells . We compared the global gene - expression proﬁles of ES cells , iPS cells , and Fbx15 b geo / b geo MEFs using DNA microarrays ( Figure 4A ) . In addition , we examined Fbx15 b geo / b geo MEFs in which the four factors had been introduced without G418 selection , immortalized MEFs expressing K - RasV12 , and NIH 3T3 cells transformed with H - RasV12 . Pearson correlation analysis revealed that iPS cells are clustered closely with ES cells but sepa - rately from ﬁbroblasts and their derivatives ( Figure 4A ) . The microarray analyses identiﬁed genes that were com - monly upregulated in ES cells and iPS cells , including Myb , Kit , Gdf3 , and Zic3 ( group I , Figure 4B and Table S3 ) . Other genes were upregulated more efﬁciently in ES cells , iPS - MEF4 , and iPS - MEF10 than in iPS - MEF3 clones , including Dppa3 , Dppa4 , Dppa5 , Nanog , Sox2 , Esrrb , and Rex1 ( group II ) . Lower expression of these genes may account for the lack of pluripotency in iPS - MEF3 cells . In addition , we found genes that were upregu - lated more prominently in ES cells than in iPS cells , includ - ing Dnmt3a , Dnmt3b , Dnmt3l , Utf1 , Tcl1 , and the LIF receptor gene ( group III ) . These data conﬁrm that iPS cells are similar , but not identical , to ES cells . We examined the pluripotency of iPS cells by teratoma formation ( Figure 5A ; Table S6 and Figure S3 ) . We ob - tained tumors with 5 iPS - MEF10 clones , 3 iPS - MEF4 clones , 1 iPS - MEF4wt clone , and 6 iPS - MEF3 clones after subcutaneous injection into nude mice . Histological examination revealed that 2 iPS - MEF10 clones ( 3 and 6 ) , 2 iPS - MEF4 clones ( 2 and 7 ) , and the iPS - MEF4wt - 4 clone differentiated into all three germ layers , including neural tissues , cartilage , and columnar epithelium . iPS - MEF10 - 6 could give rise to all three germ layers even after 30 pas - sages ( Table S6 and Figure S3 ) . We conﬁrmed differentia - tion into neural and muscle tissues by immunostaining ( Figure 5B ) and RT - PCR ( Figure S4 ) . By contrast , these teratomas did not express the trophoblast marker Cdx2 ( Figure S4 ) . iPS - MEF10 - 1 tumors differentiated into ecto - derm and endoderm , but not mesoderm , and no signs of differentiation were observed in tumors derived from the remaining iPS - MEF10 ( 7 and 10 ) or from iPS - MEF4 - 10 . 666 Cell 126 , 663 – 676 , August 25 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . These data demonstrate that the majority of , but not all , iPS - MEF10 and iPS - MEF4 clones exhibit pluripotency . In contrast , all tumors derived from iPS - MEF3 clones were composed entirely of undifferentiated cells ( Table S6 and Figure S3 ) . Thus , although the three factors ( Oct3 / 4 , c - Myc , and Klf4 ) could induce the expression of some ES cell marker genes , they were not able to induce pluripotency . iPS - MEF10 , iPS - MEF4 , and iPS - MEF3 cells formed em - bryoid bodies in noncoated plastic dishes ( Figure 5C ) . When grown in tissue culture dishes , the embryoid bodies from iPS - MEF10 and iPS - MEF4 cells attached to the dish bottom and initiated differentiation . After 3 days , immu - nostainingdetectedcellspositivefor a - smoothmuscleac - tin ( mesoderm marker ) , a - fetoprotein ( endoderm marker ) , and b III tubulin ( ectoderm marker ) ( Figure 5D ) . By contrast , embryoid bodies from iPS - MEF3 cells remained undiffer - entiated even when cultured in gelatin - coated dishes ( Fig - ure 5C ) . These data conﬁrmed pluripotency of iPS - MEF10 and iPS - MEF4 and nullipotency of iPS - MEF3 in vitro . Figure 3 .

We next introduced the four selected factors into tail - tip ﬁbroblasts ( TTFs ) of four 7 - week - old male Fbx15 b geo / b geo mice on a C57 / BL6 - 129 hybrid background . We obtained 3 G418 - resistant colonies , from each of which we could establish iPS cells ( iPS - TTF4 ) . We also introduced the four factors into TTFs from a 12 - week - old female Fbx15 b geo / b geo mouse , which also constitutively ex - pressed green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) from the CAG promoter and had a C57 / BL6 - 129 - ICR hybrid back - ground . Of the 13 G418 - resistant colonies obtained , we isolated 6 clones from which we could establish iPS cells ( iPS - TTFgfp4 , clones 1 – 6 ) . In addition , we established another iPS - TTFgfp4 ( clone 7 ) , in which the cDNA for each of the four factors was ﬂanked with two loxP sites in the transgene . These cells were morphologically indis - tinguishable from ES cells ( Figure 6A ) . RT - PCR showed that clones 3 and 7 of iPS - TTFgfp4 expressed the majority of ES cell marker genes at high levels and the others at lower levels ( Figure 6B ) . In another attempt , we used either the T58A mutant or the wild - type c - Myc for transduction and established 5 iPS - TTFgfp4 clones ( clones 8 – 12 ) and 3 iPS - TTFgfp4wt clones ( clones 1 – 3 ) ( Figure S5 ) .

We transplanted 2 iPS - TTF4 and 6 iPS - TTFgfp4 clones into nude mice , all of which produced tumors containing tissues of all three germ layers ( Table S6 and Figure S3 ) . We then introduced 2 clones of iPS - TTFgfp4 cells ( clones 3 and 7 ) into C57 / BL6 blastocysts by microinjection . With iPS - TTFgfp4 - 3 , we obtained 18 embryos at E13 . 5 , 2 of which showed contribution of GFP - positive iPS cells ( Figure 6C ) . Histological analyses conﬁrmed that iPS cells contributed to all three germ layers ( Figure 6D ) . We ob - served GFP - positive cells in the gonad but could not de - termine whether they were germ cells or somatic cells . With iPS - TTFgfp4 - 7 , we obtained 22 embryos at E7 . 5 , 3 of which were positive for GFP . With the 2 clones , we had 27 pups born , but none of them were chimeric mice . In addition , iPS - TTFgfp4 cells could differentiate into all three germ layers in vitro ( Figure S7 ) . These data demon - strate that the four selected factors could induce pluripo - tent cells from adult mouse ﬁbroblast cultures . Figure 6 .

We further characterized the expression of the four fac - tors and others in iPS cells . Real - time PCR conﬁrmed that endogenous expression of Oct3 / 4 and Sox2 was lower in iPS cells than in ES cells ( Figure S8 ) . However , the total amount of the four factors from the endogenous genes and the transgenes exceeded the normal expression levels in ES cells . In contrast , Western blot analyses showed that the total protein amounts of the four factors in iPS cells were comparable to those in ES cells ( Fig - ure 7A ; Figure S8 ) . We could detect Nanog and E - Ras pro - teins in iPS cells , but at lower levels than those in ES cells ( Figures 7A and 7B ; Figure S8 ) . The p53 levels in iPS cells were lower than those in MEFs and equivalent to those in ES cells ( Figure 7A ; Figure S9 ) . The p21 levels in iPS cells varied in each clone and were between those in ES cells and MEFs ( Figure S9 ) . Upon differentiation in vitro , the to - tal mRNA expression levels of Oct3 / 4 and Sox2 decreased but remained much higher than in ES cells . In contrast , their protein levels decreased to comparable levels in iPS cells and ES cells ( Figure 7B ) . Southern blot analyses showed that each iPS clone has a unique transgene integration pattern ( Figure 7C ) . Karyo - typing analyses of the iPS - TTFgfp4 ( clones 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , and 11 ) and iPS - TTFgfp4wt ( clones 1 – 3 ) demonstrated that 2 iPS - TTFgfp4 clones and all of the iPS - TTFgfp4wt clones showed a normal karyotype of 40XX ( Figure 7D ) , while the other 3 iPS - TTFgfp4 clones were 39XO , 40XO + 10 , and 40Xi ( X ) . Analyses of PCR - based simple sequence length polymorphisms ( SSLPs ) demonstrated that iPS - MEF clones have a mixed background of C57 / BL6 and 129 ( Table S7 ) , whereas iPS - TTFgfp clones have a mixed background of ICR , C57 / BL6 , and 129 ( Table S8 ) . Finally , we found that iPS cells could not remain undifferentiated when cultured in the absence of feeder cells , even with the presence of LIF ( Figure 7E ) . These results , together with the different gene - expression patterns , exclude the possibility that iPS cells are merely contamination of pre - existing ES cells . Finally , subclones of iPS cells were pos - itive for alkaline phosphatase and could differentiate into all three germ layers in vitro ( Figure S10 ) , conﬁrming their clonal nature . DISCUSSION Oct3 / 4 , Sox2 , and Nanog have been shown to function as core transcription factors in maintaining pluripotency ( Boyer et al . , 2005 ; Loh et al . , 2006 ) . Among the three , we found that Oct3 / 4 and Sox2 are essential for the gen - eration of iPS cells . Surprisingly , Nanog is dispensable . In addition , we identiﬁed c - Myc and Klf4 as essential factors . These two tumor - related factors could not be replaced by other oncogenes including E - Ras , Tcl1 , b - catenin , and Stat3 ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . The c - Myc protein has many downstream targets that enhance proliferation and transformation ( Adhikary and Eilers , 2005 ) , many of which may have roles in the gener - ation of iPS cells . Of note , c - Myc associates with histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) complexes , including TRRAP , which is a core subunit of the TIP60 and GCN5 HAT com - plexes ( McMahon et al . , 1998 ) , CREB binding protein ( CBP ) , and p300 ( Vervoorts et al . , 2003 ) . Within the mam - malian genome , there may be up to 25 , 000 c - Myc binding sites ( Cawley et al . , 2004 ) , many more than the predicted number of Oct3 / 4 and Sox2 binding sites ( Boyer et al . , 2005 ; Loh et al . , 2006 ) . c - Myc protein may induce global histone acetylation ( Fernandez et al . , 2003 ) , thus allowing Oct3 / 4 and Sox2 to bind to their speciﬁc target loci . Klf4 has been shown to repress p53 directly ( Rowland et al . , 2005 ) , and p53 protein has been shown to suppress Nanog during ES cell differentiation ( Lin et al . , 2004 ) . We found that iPS cells showed levels of p53 protein lower than those in MEFs ( Figure 7A ) . Thus , Klf4 might contrib - ute to activation of Nanog and other ES cell - speciﬁc genes through p53 repression . Alternatively , Klf4 might function as an inhibitor of Myc - induced apoptosis through the re - pression of p53 in our system ( Zindy et al . , 1998 ) . On the other hand , Klf4 activates p21 CIP1 , thereby suppressing cell proliferation ( Zhang et al . , 2000 ) . This antiproliferation function of Klf4 might be inhibited by c - Myc , which sup - presses the expression of p21 CIP1 ( Seoane et al . , 2002 ) . The balance between c - Myc and Klf4 may be important for the generation of iPS cells . One question that remains concerns the origin of our iPS cells . With our retroviral expression system , we esti - mated that only a small portion of cells expressing the four factors became iPS cells ( Figure S11 ) . The low fre - quency suggests that rare tissue stem / progenitor cells that coexisted in the ﬁbroblast cultures might have given rise to the iPS cells . Indeed , multipotent stem cells have been isolated from skin ( Dyce et al . , 2004 ; Toma et al . , 2001 , 2005 ) . These studies showed that (cid:1) 0 . 067 % of mouse skin cells are stem cells . One explanation for the low frequency of iPS cell derivation is that the four factors transform tissue stem cells . However , we found that the four factors induced iPS cells with comparably low efﬁ - ciency even from bone marrow stroma , which should be more enriched in mesenchymal stem cells and other multi - potent cells ( Tables S2 and S6 ) . Furthermore , cells in - duced by the three factors were nullipotent ( Table S6 and Figure S3 ) . DNA microarray analyses suggested that iPS - MEF4 cells and iPS - MEF3 cells have the same origin ( Figure 4 ) . These results do not favor multipotent tissue stem cells as the origin of iPS cells . There are several other possibilities for the low fre - quency of iPS cell derivation . First , the levels of the four factors required for generation of pluripotent cells may have narrow ranges , and only a small portion of cells ex - pressingallfourofthefactorsattherightlevelscanacquire ES cell - like properties . Consistent with this idea , a mere 50 % increase or decrease in Oct3 / 4 proteins induces differentiation of ES cells ( Niwa et al . , 2000 ) . iPS clones overexpressed the four factors when RNA levels were an - alyzed , buttheirproteinlevels werecomparabletothosein EScells ( Figures7Aand7B ; FigureS8 ) , suggestingthatthe iPS clones possess a mechanism ( or mechanisms ) that Cell 126 , 663 – 676 , August 25 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . 671 Figure 7 . Biochemical and Genetic Analyses of iPS Cells ( A ) Western blot analyses of the four factors and other proteins in iPS cells ( MEF4 - 7 , MEF10 - 6 , TTFgfp4 - 3 , and TTFgfp4 - 7 ) , ES cells , and MEFs . ( B ) Changes in RNA ( left ) and protein ( right ) levels of Oct3 / 4 , Sox2 , and Nanog in iPS cells and ES cells that were undifferentiated on STO feeder cells ( U ) or induced to differentiated in vitro through embryoid body formation ( D ) . Shown are relative expression levels compared to undifferentiated ES cells . Data of MEFs and TTFs are also shown . RNA levels were determined with real - time PCR using primers speciﬁc for endogenous transcripts 672 Cell 126 , 663 – 676 , August 25 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . tightly regulates the protein levels of the four factors . We speculate that high amounts of the four factors are re - quired in the initial stage of iPS cell generation , but , once they acquire ES cell - like status , too much of the factors are detrimental for self - renewal . Only a small portion of transduced cells show such appropriate transgene ex - pression . Second , generation of pluripotent cells may require additional chromosomal alterations , which take place spontaneously during culture or are induced by some of the four factors . Although the iPS - TTFgfp4 clones had largely normal karyotypes ( Figure 7D ) , we cannot rule out the existence of minor chromosomal alterations . Site - speciﬁc retroviral insertion may also play a role . Southern blotanalysesshowedthateachiPSclonehas (cid:1) 20retroviral integrations ( Figure 7C ) . Some of these may have caused silencingorfusionwithendogenousgenes . Furtherstudies will be required to determine the origin of iPS cells . Another unsolved question is whether the four factors we identiﬁed play roles in reprogramming induced by fu - sion with ES cells or nuclear transfer into oocytes . Since the four factors are expressed in ES cells at high levels , it is reasonable to speculate that they are involved in the reprogramming machinery that exists in ES cells . Our re - sult is also consistent with the ﬁnding that the reprogram - ming activity resides in the nucleus , but not in the cyto - plasm , of ES cells ( Do and Scholer , 2004 ) . However , iPS cells were not identical to ES cells , as shown by the global gene - expression patterns and DNA methylation status . It is possible that we have missed additional important fac - tors . One such candidate is ECAT1 , although its forced expression in iPS cells did not consistently upregulate ES cell marker genes ( Figure S12 ) . More obscure are the roles of the four factors , especially Klf4 and c - Myc , in the reprogramming observed in oo - cytes . Both Klf4 and c - Myc are dispensable for preimplan - tation mouse development ( Baudino et al . , 2002 ; Katz et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , c - myc is not detected in oo - cytes ( Domashenko et al . , 1997 ) . In contrast , L - myc is ex - pressed maternally in oocytes . Klf17 and Klf7 , but not Klf4 , are found in expressed sequence - tag libraries derived from unfertilized mouse eggs . Klf4 and c - Myc might be compensated by these related proteins . It is highly likely that other factors are also required to induce complete reprogramming and totipotency in oocytes . It is likely that the four factors from the transgenes are required for maintaining the iPS cells since the expression of Oct3 / 4 and Sox2 from the endogenous genes remained low ( Figure 7B ; Figure S8 ) . We intended to prove this by using transgenes ﬂanked by two loxP sites and obtained an iPS clone ( TTF4gfp4 - 7 ) . However , we noticed that these cells contain multiple loxP sites on multiple chromo - somes , and , thus , the Cre - mediated recombination would cause not only deletion of the transgenes but also inter - and intrachromosomal rearrangements . Studies with conditional expression systems , such as the tetracycline - mediated system , are required to answer this question . We showed that the iPS cells can differentiate in vitro and in vivo even with the presence of the retroviral vectors containing the four factors . We found that Oct3 / 4 and Sox2 proteins decreased signiﬁcantly during in vitro differ - entiation ( Figure 7B ) . Retroviral expression has been shown to be suppressed in ES cells and further silenced upon differentiation by epigenetic modiﬁcations , such as DNA methylation ( Yao et al . , 2004 ) . The same mechanisms are likely to play roles in transgene repression in iPS cells since they express Dnmt3a , 3b , and 3l , albeit at lower levels than ES cells do ( Table S5 ) . In addition , we found that iPS cells possess a mechanism ( or mechanisms ) that lowers protein levels of the transgenes and Nanog ( Figure 7B ; Figure S8 ) . The same mechanism may be enhanced during differentiation . However , silencing of Oct3 / 4 in iPS - TTFgfp4 - 3 cells was not complete , which may explain our inability to obtain live chimeric mice after blastocyst microinjection of iPS cells . An unexpected ﬁnding in this study was the efﬁcient ac - tivation of Fgf4 and Fbx15 by the combination of the three factors devoid of Sox2 since these two genes have been shown to be regulated synergistically by Oct3 / 4 and Sox2 ( Tokuzawa et al . , 2003 ; Yuan et al . , 1995 ) . It is also surprising that Nanog is dispensable for induction and maintenance of iPS cells . More detailed analyses of iPS cells will enhance our understanding of transcriptional regulation in pluripotent stem cells . Our ﬁndings may have wider applications , as we have found that transgene reporters with other ES cell marker genes , suchas Nanog , canreplace the Fbx15 knockindur - ing selection ( K . Okita and S . Y . , unpublished data ) . How - ever , we stilldonotknow whetherthefourfactorscangen - erate pluripotent cells from human somatic cells . Use of c - Myc may not be suitable for clinical applications , and the process may require speciﬁc culture environments . Nevertheless , the ﬁnding is an important stepin controlling pluripotency , which may eventually allow the creation of pluripotent cells directly from somatic cells of patients . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Mice Fbx15 b geo / b geo mice were generated with 129SvJae - derived RF8 ES cells as described previously ( Tokuzawa et al . , 2003 ) and were ( white columns ) or those common for both endogenous and transgenic transcripts ( white and black columns ) .

These micewereusedforprimarymouseembryonicﬁbroblast ( MEF ) andtail - tip ﬁbroblast ( TTF ) preparations . To generate Fbx15 b geo / b geo mice with constitutive expression of GFP , an Fbx15 b geo / b geo mouse ( C57 / BL6 - 129 background ) was mated with an ICR mouse with the GFP trans - gene driven by the constitutive CAG promoter ( Niwa et al . , 1991 ) . The resulting Fbx15 b geo / + , GFP / + mice were intercrossed to generate Fbx15 b geo / b geo , GFP / GFP mice . Nude mice ( BALB / Jcl - nu ) were pur - chased from CLEA . Cell Culture RF8EScellsandiPScellsweremaintainedonfeederlayersofmitomy - cin C - treated STO cells as previously described ( Meiner et al . , 1996 ) . As a source of leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) , we used conditioned medium ( 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) from Plat - E cell cultures that had been transduced with a LIF - encoding vector . ES and iPS cells were pas - saged every 3 days . Plat - E packaging cells ( Morita et al . , 2000 ) , which were also used to produce retroviruses , were maintained in DMEM containing 10 % FBS , 50 units / 50 m g / ml penicillin / streptomycin , 1 m g / ml puromycin ( Sigma ) , and100 m g / mlofblasticidin S ( Funakoshi ) . For MEF isolation , uteri isolated from 13 . 5 - day - pregnant mice were washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . The head and visceral tissues were removed from isolated embryos . The remaining bodies werewashed infreshPBS , mincedusing apair ofscissors , transferred into a 0 . 1 mM trypsin / 1 mM EDTA solution ( 3 ml per embryo ) , and incubated at 37 (cid:2) C for 20 min . After incubation , an additional 3 ml per embryo of 0 . 1 mM trypsin / 1 mM EDTA solution was added , and the mixturewasincubatedat37 (cid:2) Cfor20min . Aftertrypsinization , anequal amount of medium ( 6 ml per embryo DMEM containing 10 % FBS ) was added and pipetted up and down a few times to help with tissue dis - sociation . After incubation of the tissue / medium mixture for 5 min at room temperature , the supernatant was transferred into a new tube . Cells were collected by centrifugation ( 200 3 g for 5 min at 4 (cid:2) C ) and resuspended in fresh medium . 1 3 10 6 cells ( passage 1 ) were cultured on 100 mm dishes at 37 (cid:2) C with 5 % CO 2 .

Twenty - four hours after transduction , the medium was replaced . MEFs or TTFs were seeded at 8 3 10 5 cells per 100 mm dish on mito - mycin C - treated STO feeders . After 24 hr , virus - containing superna - tants derived from these Plat - E cultures were ﬁltered through a 0 . 45 m m cellulose acetate ﬁlter ( Schleicher & Schuell ) and supple - mented with 4 m g / ml polybrene ( Nacalai Tesque ) . Target cells were in - cubated in the virus / polybrene - containing supernatants for 4 hr to overnight . After infection , the cells were replated in 10 ml fresh medium . Three days after infection , we added G418 at a ﬁnal concen - tration of 0 . 3 mg / ml . Clones were selected for 2 to 3 weeks . Plasmid Construction To generate pMXs - gw , we introduced a Gateway cassette rfA ( Invitro - gen ) into the EcoRI / XhoI site of the pMXs plasmid . Primers used are listed in Table S9 .
