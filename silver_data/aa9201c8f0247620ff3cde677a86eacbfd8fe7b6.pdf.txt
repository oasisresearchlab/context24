Investigating the role of chitin deacetylation in Magnaporthe oryzae Ivey Geoghegan Linacre College University of Oxford A thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy October 2015 Abstract The fungal cell wall is a highly complex and dynamic structure . It plays a critical role in maintaining cellular integrity , as well as forming the interfacial barrier with the envi - ronment . It comprises a matrix of interconnected polysaccharides and proteins , which can change in response to altered environmental conditions , during interactions with other organisms , or during cellular growth and morphogenesis . One such observed change is the deacetylation of chitin to chitosan , a reaction catalysed by a family of carbohydrate esterase enzymes known as chitin deacetylases ( CDAs ) . In phytopathogenic species , such as the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae , chitosan has been shown to be a compo - nent of the cell wall during pathogenic interactions . Here , it was hypothesized that the deacetylation of chitin acts as a ‘stealth mechanism’ , by both protecting the fungal cell wall from plant chitinase activity , and by preventing the activation of plant defence re - sponses . In addition , di(cid:11)erences in the physical and chemical properties of chitin and chitosan are such that chitin deacetylation may also be required for cell wall modi(cid:12)ca - tion during cellular morphogenesis . In order to test these hypotheses , the role of chitin deacetylation in appressorium development and vegetative growth were investigated . During germling morphogenesis , chitosan staining revealed that chitin deacetylation occurs both prior to , and during , appressorium development . Through the creation of single , double and triple deletion strains of three CDAs ( CBP1 , CDA2 and CDA3 ) , chitosan was shown to be necessary for appressorium development on arti(cid:12)cial surfaces . However , chitin deacetylation is not required for appressorium development on plant surfaces , arguing against its role in morphogenesis . Exogenous application of chitosan and chemical inducers of appressorium development revealed that chitosan is instead required for germling adhesion and surface sensing . Fluorescent tagging of these CDAs and colocalization with chitin synthase VII suggests that the deacetylation of chitin may involve close association / collaboration between these two families of enzymes . Chitin deacetylation also occurs in the septa and lateral walls of vegetative hyphae . Two further CDAs ( CDA1 and CDA4 ) were characterized by gene deletion and (cid:13)uo - rescent protein tagging , and were found to be required for chitin deacetylation in these locations . Although chitin deacetylation was dramatically reduced in the deletion strains , no defects in growth or morphology were observed . This again argues against a role for chitin deacetylation in morphogenesis , and also suggests that chitosan is not a crucial structural component of the cell wall . However , mCherry fusions of Cda4 provided fur - ther evidence of possible collaboration between CDAs and chitin synthases . Lastly , the role of chitosan hydrolysis was investigated . Cell wall hydrolases have long been hypothesized to have roles in cell wall modi(cid:12)cation during morphogenesis . To test this hypothesis , strains were created in which the gene encoding the sole chitosanase ( CSN ) in M . oryzae was either deleted or overexpressed . However , these strains proved to be identical to the WT strain under all conditions tested . In addition , a promoter fusion revealed only weak expression of CSN in vegetative hyphae . Chitosanase therefore appears not to have a role in cell wall modi(cid:12)cation during morphogenesis , but its true purpose remains unclear . In summary , the data in this thesis do not support the original hypotheses regarding the roles of chitin deacetylation or chitosan hydrolysis . Instead , novel roles for chitosan were unmasked , which demonstrate the complex and multifaceted nature of the cell wall . Novel mechanistic insights into chitin deacetylation were also revealed , which suggest that our current knowledge of chitin synthesis and deacetylation is far from complete . 2 Acknowledgements First and foremost , I must thank Professor Sarah Gurr for her supervision and support over the past 4 years .

M . oryzae is a member of the Magnaporthe grisea species complex , and can cause disease in over 50 di(cid:11)erent grass species , including barley and wheat , making it a potential threat to a number of major food crops ( Ou , 1985 ) . Although precise (cid:12)gures for crop losses resulting from M . oryzae infection are few , and confounded by additional factors such as insect pests and abiotic factors , there is no doubt that this pathogen causes signi(cid:12)cant crop losses , even with the use of various control strategies . Epidemics of M . oryzae infection can cause devastating yield losses of over 90 % ( Thinlay et al . , 2000 ) , although even in non - epidemic years , losses are in the region of 10 % - 30 % ( Skamnioti and Gurr , 2009 ) . In many Asian countries , rice constitutes a signi(cid:12)cant proportion of the daily calories consumed , and so such crop losses can be a major cause of under - nourishment in these populations . Compounding these problems , global population is projected to increase to over 9 billion by 2050 , with much of this increase occurring in developing countries with a high dependency on rice production ( Lee , 2011 ) . Therefore , more food will have to be produced from a cultivatable land area that is the same , if not smaller than that currently used . Increases in crop production must also occur in the face of adverse abiotic factors such as drought or (cid:13)ooding , which may well become more prevalent and severe as a result of climate change ( Wheeler and von Braun , 2013 ) . Thus , the study of Magnaporthe oryzae is essential if we are to successfully combat rice blast disease and safeguard future rice production . In addition , this fungus is not only important as a pathogen in its own right , but can also be used as a model organism for the study of hemibiotrophy and appressorium - driven infection in other phytopathogenic fungi . M . oryzae has a fully sequenced genome , can be grown in vitro and is genetically tractable - it is possible to investigate gene function by making targeted gene deletions , or to investigate protein localization by expression of (cid:13)uorescent protein fusions . The use of these tools and resources has generated a wealth of information regarding the life - cycle of this fungus and the mechanisms by which it is able to successfully infect rice plants . 9 1 . 1 . 2 Life - cycle of Magnaporthe oryzae Primary infection of rice plants by M . oryzae generally occurs as a result of conidial dis - persal from the conidiophores of vegetatively growing fungus , or the sporulating lesions of an infected plant . Vegetative growth of M . oryzae can include growth on dead residue from a previous crop , infected seed , or growth on other grass species . Dispersal of these three - celled pyriform structures , by wind or dew - drop splash ( Ou , 1985 ) , leads to contact between the conidia and the aerial surface of a rice plant . Following this initial contact , the conidium immediately adheres to the plant surface due to the presence of spore tip mucilage which is a glycoprotein - rich secretion from the apex of the conidium ( Hamer et al . , 1988 ) . Subsequent germination of conidia requires the presence of free water , and results in the growth of a polarized germ tube , usually from the apical cell of the coni - dium . At this stage , sensing of various physical and chemical stimuli by the germling occurs , which is crucial for inducing the formation of a dome - shaped structure known as the appressorium . Surface hydrophobicity is one of the most important stimuli ; even in the absence of a leaf surface , appressorium development can be induced by an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surface , such as Te(cid:13)on . The precise mechanism by which hydrophobicity is sensed by germlings remains mysterious , but is known to be dependant upon the G - protein coupled receptor ( GPCR ) Pth11 ( DeZwaan et al . , 1999 ) , and the hydrophobin Mpg1 ( Talbot et al . , 1993 , 1996 ) , a protein which self - assembles into amphipathic mono - layers at hydrophilic - hydrophobic interfaces ( Sunde et al . , 2008 ) . Chemical stimuli are of equal importance to physical stimuli ; in the absence of hydrophobicity , appressorium formation can be induced by cutin monomers ( e . g . 1 , 16 - hexadecanediol ) , the perception of which also appears to be dependant upon Pth11 ( DeZwaan et al . , 1999 ) . Plant waxes also induce appressorium development , although via a separate signalling pathway . The integral membrane protein Sho1 and the signalling mucin Msb2 are reported to have over - lapping functions in the sensing of waxes in M . oryzae ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . These proteins ( particularly Msb2 ) also appear to be involved in the sensing of physical surface cues , a function that is conserved amongst a number of species of phytopathogenic fungi ( Lanver et al . , 2010 ; Leroch et al . , 2015 ; P(cid:19)erez - Nadales and Di Pietro , 2011 ) . Downstream of these aforementioned receptors , lie two main signalling cascades : Activation of Pth11 by surface hydrophobicity and cutin monomers leads to an increase in intracellular levels 10 of the second messenger cAMP , which in turn activates the cAMP dependant protein kinase , CpkA ( Choi and Dean , 1997 ; Mitchell and Dean , 1995 ) . Msb2 and Sho1 both act upstream of a kinase cascade , the activation of which results in the phosphorylation and activation of the MAP kinase Pmk1 ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . However , it is also likely that cross - talk also exists between these two pathways ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . Following acti - vation of CpkA and Pmk1 , various transcription factors ( e . g . Mstu1 ( Nishimura et al . , 2009 ) ) are in turn activated , leading to the upregulation of genes necessary to bring about appressorium development . The appressorium is a melanized , dome - shaped cell that is necessary for the pene - tration of plant cells by the fungus . Once formed , the appressorium accumulates high concentrations of glycerol ( de Jong et al . , 1997 ) , due to the break - down of intracellular stores of other molecules , such as lipids or trehalose ( Thines et al . , 2000 ) . The accumu - lation of this glycerol results in the build up of extraordinary turgor pressure ( up to 8 Mpa ) in the appressorium ( Howard et al . , 1991 ) . This is dependant upon the presence of melanin in the cell wall of the appressorium . Here , melanin acts both as a barrier to prevent di(cid:11)usion of glycerol out of the appressorium , and contributes to the physical strength of the wall ( Chumley et al . , 1990 ; Howard et al . , 1991 ) . The turgor pressure is necessary for the penetration of the plant cells by a thin hypha called the penetration peg . Once the plant cell has been successfully penetrated , the initial growth phase of M . oryzae is biotrophic and therefore symptomless . Invasion hyphae , surrounded by the plant - derived Extra Invasive - Hyphal membrane ( EIHM ) , spread between adjacent cells via plasmodesmata ( Kankanala et al . , 2007 ) . Successful colonisation of the plant de - pends upon the production and secretion of e(cid:11)ector proteins , which subvert host cellular processes in order to create conditions conducive to the biotrophic growth of the fun - gus . E(cid:11)ectors can be divided into two types , depending upon their method of secretion - Those that are delivered into the cytoplasm of the plant cell in a golgi - independant man - ner via the Biotrophic Interfacial Complex ( BIC ) ( a plant membrane - derived structure ) , and those that are delivered into the apoplast in a golgi - dependant manner ( Khang et al . , 2010 ; Giraldo et al . , 2013 ) . Following (cid:24) 72 hr of biotrophic growth , the fungus switches to a necrotrophic growth phase . At this stage , the fungal hyphae spread rapidly through 11 the plant , causing death of the plant cells , and resulting in the appearance of the disease lesions that are characteristic of rice blast disease . Under conditions of high humidity , conidiation occurs and thus the cycle begins again ( Wilson and Talbot , 2009 ) . The entire infection cycle of M . oryzae takes just 5 - 7 days , meaning that many cycles of infection can occur within a single growing season ( i . e . it is polycyclic ) . As well as being able to infect all aerial parts of the plant ( including leaves , stems and panicles ) , M . oryzae has also been found to infect the roots of rice plants . In this case , the fungus follows a di(cid:11)erent developmental programme that is more typical of root - speci(cid:12)c pathogens , such as Gaeumannomyces graminis ( Sesma and Osbourn , 2004 ) . Figure 1 . 1 : The life - cycle of the rice blast fungus , Magnaporthe oryzae . Infection begins with the dispersal of conidia , by wind or dew - drop splash . Conidia which land on the aerial part of a plant adhere , and germinate in the presence of free water . Appressorium development is induced by perception of various physical and chemical factors present on the plant surface . Generation of high turgor pressures within the appressorium results in penetration of the leaf . The invasive hyphae ramify throughout the plant , spreading from cell to cell . After (cid:24) 5 days conidiation occurs , and the cycle begins again . Adapted from Wilson and Talbot ( 2009 ) . 12 1 . 1 . 3 Current control strategies Given the extremely destructive nature of this pathogen , the control of M . oryzae is clearly of great importance . Current strategies can be broadly divided into those based on plant disease resistance through breeding , and those a(cid:11)orded by chemical control strategies . In most of the rice cultivars grown , resistance to M . oryzae is imparted by a single dominant Resistance ( R ) gene . Currently , over 100 R genes have been discovered in rice , although of these , only 20 have been cloned and characterized ( Wu et al . , 2015 ) . An R gene encodes a protein that recognizes an M . oryzae protein , termed an Avirulence ( Avr ) protein . Currently , over 40 AVR genes have been identi(cid:12)ed ( Zhang and Xu , 2014 ) . AVR genes generally encode e(cid:11)ectors expressed in the invasive hyphae of M . oryzae . Delivery of these e(cid:11)ectors into plant cells ( as discussed in Section 1 . 1 . 2 ) leads to interaction ( either direct or indirect ) between the Avr protein and the R protein . This triggers the hyper - sensitive response , and therefore death of the invading fungus . Unfortunately , R genes may only recognize certain strains of M . oryzae , limiting their e(cid:14)cacy in the (cid:12)eld . In addition , the resistance imparted by such R genes can be short - lived , particularly when deployed in the large monocultures typical of modern farming methods . Strong selection pressure leads to mutation or deletion of the cognate AVR genes in M . oryzae , allowing it to overcome the plant resistance ( Skamnioti and Gurr , 2009 ) . However , these problems can be somewhat alleviated by the presence of multiple R genes in a single cultivar , the use of broad - spectrum R genes , and / or the use of cultivar mixtures . Chemical control strategies can complement the use of resistant cultivars , provid - ing an additional layer of control against strains not recognized by resistance genes , or against other species of fungal pathogen . Fungicides represent the main chemical control strategy , particularly in the more resource - rich farming economies such as Japan , which represents 46 % of the global rice - blast fungicide market , despite growing only 2 % of the world’s rice ( Skamnioti and Gurr , 2009 ) . Most fungicides directly disrupt a key cellu - lar process in order to attenuate fungal growth and development . Melanin biosynthesis inhibitors ( MBIs ) , are one of the most widely - used fungicides of this type ( Skamnioti and Gurr , 2009 ) . This class of fungicide can be further subdivided depending on which step is inhibited : MBI - Ds , such as carpromatid , which inhibits the scytalone dehydratase enzyme ( Kurahashi et al . , 1997 ) , and MBI - Rs , such as tricyclazole , a systemic fungicide 13 which inhibits polyhydroxyl - napthalene reductase ( Froyd et al . , 1976 ; Tokousbalides and Sisler , 1978 ) . In either case , application of these fungicides results in the loss of melanin , which is a key component of the cell wall in the appressorium , as discussed previously ( Section 1 . 1 . 2 ) . However , the inhibition of melanin biosynthesis is only e(cid:11)ective at pre - venting plant infection when implemented prior to appressorium development and plant penetration by the fungus . Other fungicides , such as isoprothiolane are e(cid:11)ective in dis - rupting fungal growth at any stage in development . Isoprothiolane is an inhibitor of the Kennedy pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis , and therefore causes disruption of fungal membranes ( Kodama et al . , 1979 ; Yoshida et al . , 1984 ) . It is systemic , being absorbed by the plant following application , meaning that direct application onto the fungus is not required ( Uesugi , 2001 ) . The fungal plasma membrane is also the tar - get of another group of fungicides , the sterol biosynthesis inhibitors . This group can be subdivided into four classes , depending on which particular enzyme is inhibited . Of these , propiconazole , an inhibitor of a cytochrome P - 450 monooxygenase , is one of the most widely - used against M . oryzae ( Leroux , 2003 ) . Finally , the strobilurins ( e . g . azoxys - trobin ) , which are derivatives of naturally occurring secondary metabolites produced by lignocellulytic fungi , inhibit mitochondrial respiration by preventing electron transfer be - tween cytochrome b and cytochrome c 1 ( Godwin et al . , 1992 ) ( Becker et al . , 1981 ) . Apart from application of fungicides , pathogenic fungi can also be controlled indirectly , through activation of plant defence responses . Probenazole triggers the accumulation of salicylic acid in treated plants ( Yoshioka et al . , 2001 ) , thereby causing the upregulation of a host of genes involved in plant systemic acquired resistance ( SAR ) ( Iwai et al . , 2007 ) . This potentially increases plant resistance to not only M . oryzae , but also to a broad - spectrum of fungi , bacteria and viruses . As with plant resistance genes however , the emergence of fungal resistance to these chemical treatments is problematic . Although some fungicides , such as MBI - Rs , have remained e(cid:11)ective after decades of use , others , such as carpromatid have only been able to be used for a few years before resistant M . oryzae strains emerged ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , whilst some fungi evolve fungicide resistance , others exhibit inher - ent insensitivity to certain types of fungicide , for example Cryptococcus species to the echinocandins and Aspergillus terreus to amphotericin B to name but a few ( Denning 14 and Bromley , 2015 ) . The cost of such fungicides must also be taken into consideration . In some cases , the cost of fungicides ( e . g . echinocandins ) is such that their use in agri - culture is simply not economically viable . Taken together , it is clear that the search for novel fungicides is a necessary and continuous process . The targets of fungicides need to be both essential to the normal development and integrity of the fungal cell , and speci(cid:12)c to fungi , in order to avoid deleterious e(cid:11)ects in the host . The fungal cell wall ful(cid:12)ls these requirements : it is essential for cellular integrity , as well as structurally and composition - ally unique to fungi . Additionally , as many enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis and remodelling are extracellular , the cell permeability of the fungicides need not be of pri - mary concern . Although some fungicides targeting cell wall related processes have been developed ( discussed later ) , our limited understanding of the processes underpinning cell wall synthesis and remodelling is preventing full exploitation of this target . Thus , inves - tigating mechanisms of cell wall synthesis and remodelling could be extremely valuable in tackling pathogenic fungi . 1 . 2 The fungal cell wall 1 . 2 . 1 Overview The fungal cell wall is a complex structure comprising a matrix of interconnected polysac - charides and proteins . Traditionally , the cell wall was considered as nothing more than the inert extracellular ‘armour’ of the fungal cell , maintaining cellular integrity in the face of the challenging environmental conditions faced by fungi during the course of their life - cycle . In more recent years however , the cell wall has been found to be a highly dynamic structure , with roles that extend far beyond being a simple protective shell . Cellular morphogenesis , for example , is heavily in(cid:13)uenced by the composition of the cell wall , and vice versa . The cell wall acts as a physical constraint to any changes in cell size or shape , and so any alteration to these parameters requires both the cell and the cell wall to change in a harmonious and regulated manner . In this way , cellular integrity is maintained whilst allowing the underlying cell to undergo morphogenesis . Consequently , cell wall structure and composition is observed to change considerably during cellular development , as well as di(cid:11)ering according to cell type . The importance of this process 15 has been demonstrated countless times by chemical or genetic perturbation of the cell wall , which often results in catastrophic morphogenic defects . As the outermost part of the fungus , the cell wall also forms the interface between the fungal cell and its environment . This is particularly signi(cid:12)cant during pathogenic interactions between a fungus and its host , and there are numerous examples of how fungi signi(cid:12)cantly alter the composition of their cell wall during pathogenic interactions ( detailed in the following subsections ) . Rather than simply being a reaction to a change in environment , it could instead be argued that these compositional changes allow a fungus to speci(cid:12)cally tailor the outcome of a pathogenic interaction to its favour . M . oryzae represents an ideal system in which to study the cell wall of a (cid:12)lamen - tous plant pathogen , where the inter - relationships between the di(cid:11)erent roles of the wall considered above can be investigated . The genetically tractable nature of this organism means that functional analysis and localization of any protein with a putative role in cell wall synthesis or remodelling is possible . As a phytopathogenic fungus that produces infection - speci(cid:12)c structures ( e . g . appressoria , penetration hyphae ) , M . oryzae also pro - vides an opportunity to explore how the structure , composition and synthesis of the cell wall changes both during plant infection and during the development of these specialized cell - types . Of particular interest are the trade - o(cid:11)s which likely exist between the roles of the cell wall in cellular integrity , cellular morphogenesis and pathogen - host interactions . In the following sections , our current knowledge of cell wall composition , synthesis and remodelling is reviewed , with a particular emphasis on pathogenic fungi . 1 . 2 . 2 Structure and Synthesis The structure and composition of the cell wall is known to vary considerably between di(cid:11)erent fungal species , and over the course of the fungal life - cycle . Presenting an ac - curate model for the structure of the cell wall that is applicable to all cell - types in all species of fungi is therefore impossible . This di(cid:14)culty is compounded by the fact that the majority of research into the fungal cell wall has been conducted in just a few species , including Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Lesage and Bussey , 2006 ) , Candida albicans ( Klis et al . , 2001 ) and Aspergillus fumigatus ( Bernard and Latg(cid:19)e , 2001 ) . Despite this , there is evidence that the structure and synthesis of the main cell wall components ( chitin 16 and glucans ) are widely conserved in fungi . A generalised model of the fungal cell wall , broadly applicable to most species of fungi and cell - types is presented in Figure 1 . 2 . Much of the evidence for overall wall structure has resulted from ultrastructural imaging of S . cerevisiae and C . albicans cells by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . These studies have revealed that the cell wall in these species has a laminar structure , com - prising an electron - transparent inner layer and an electron - dense outer layer ( Cappellaro et al . , 1994 ; Lesage and Bussey , 2006 ; Tokunaga et al . , 1986 ) . The inner layer is composed of an interconnected matrix of chitin and glucans , whereas the outer layer is composed of mannoproteins which are also cross - linked to the underlying polysaccharides . However , this laminar structure is not necessarily applicable to all fungi , and the manner in which di(cid:11)erent cell wall components are interlinked also di(cid:11)ers widely between species . In the following sections , the synthesis and remodelling of the major components of the fungal cell wall are reviewed . Figure 1 . 2 : Cartoon of the fungal cell wall , showing the major components and en - zymes involved in biosynthesis and remodelling . The wall is observed to have a layered structure , in which crystalline chitin forms the innermost layer . a 1 , 3 - b 1 , 3 - and b 1 , 6 - glucans con - stitute the majority of the cell wall by mass , and form the middle / outer layer . In some species , the outermost layer of the wall is dominated by highly glycosylated proteins ( mannoproteins ) , although in others these are more likely interspersed throughout the wall . The major synthase enzymes are chitin and b 1 , 3 - glucan synthase ; these are integral membrane proteins that extrude chains of chitin and b 1 , 3 - glucan respectively , into the cell wall . Remodelling of these compo - nents is performed by a series of GPI - anchored enzymes , which elongate , branch and cross - link polysaccharides . 17 Glucan synthesis Glucans are usually the most abundant polysaccharides in the cell wall , the major species of which are b 1 , 3 - glucan , b 1 , 6 - glucan and a 1 , 3 - glucan . Of these , b 1 , 3 - glucan is the most abundant form of glucan , making up 30 - 80 % of total cell wall mass ( Free , 2013 ) . This form of glucan is synthesized at the plasma membrane by b 1 , 3 - glucan synthase ( named Fks1 in most fungi ) , an integral membrane protein that synthesizes b - 1 , 3 - glucan in a vec - torial manner from an intracellular pool of UDP - glucose ( Douglas et al . , 1994 ) . Fks1 is activated by the GTP - bound form of Rho1 , which is in turn regulated at the plasma mem - brane by the GDP / GTP exchange factor Rom2 ( Qadota et al . , 1996 ; Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . , 2002 ) . Both Fks1 and Rho1 localize to areas of cell wall remodelling ( Qadota et al . , 1996 ) , and Fks1 has also been observed to colocalize with actin patches in S . cerevisiae ( Utsugi et al . , 2002 ) . Studies of b 1 , 3 - glucan synthase regulation and localization are few in (cid:12)lamentous fungi , in part due to the di(cid:14)culty in generating a functional (cid:13)uorescent fusion of this enzyme . However , a recent study in Neurospora crassa achieved live - cell imaging of a GFP - tagged Fks1 ( S(cid:19)anchez - Le(cid:19)on and Riquelme , 2015 ) . This revealed localization to hyphal apices and the outer region of the Spitzenk(cid:127)orper ( an intracellular complex of secretory vesicles situated at the tips of growing hyphae ) , and to hyphal branching sites , but surprisingly not to developing septa , suggesting that b 1 , 3 - glucan may not be a major component of the cell wall in these structures . It was also found that Fks1 was transported to the hyphal tip in macrovesicles , which are perhaps analagous to the chito - somes observed in chitin synthase fusions ( discussed later ) . Intriguingly , the distribution of these macrovesicles at the Spitzenk(cid:127)orper appears to di(cid:11)er from that of the smaller chitosomes , suggesting possible ‘functional strati(cid:12)cation’ of the Spitzenk(cid:127)orper ( Verd(cid:19)(cid:16)n et al . , 2009 ) . As in S . cerevisiae , Fks1 is believed to be regulated by Rho1 in (cid:12)lamentous fungi ( Beauvais et al . , 2001 ) . However , an additional regulator has also been identi(cid:12)ed in N . crassa , known as GS - 1 ( Glucan synthase - 1 ) . Fluorescently - tagged GS - 1 localizes to the Spitzenk(cid:127)orper in a very similar manner to Fks1 , although co - localization has not yet been attempted ( Verd(cid:19)(cid:16)n et al . , 2009 ) . Deletion of GS - 1 severely impacts b 1 , 3 - glucan synthesis , but its precise role is unknown ( Enderlin and Selitrenniko(cid:11) , 1994 ) . The synthesized b 1 , 3 - glucan is a non - crystalline polymer that adopts a helical struc - ture thought to impart both tensile strength and elasticity to the cell wall ( Krainer et al . , 18 1994 ) ( Klis et al . , 2002 ) . The precise structure of b 1 , 3 - glucan in terms of branching pat - tern and chain length likely vary between species . In S . cerevisiae , b 1 , 3 - glucan chains of (cid:24) 1500 residues long are branched at 3 % of the residues by the addition of b 1 , 3 - glucan chains via a 1 , 6 linkage ( Manners et al . , 1973a ) . In A . fumigatus , the overall structure is similar , except for the presence of b 1 , 4 - glucan interspersed throughout the b 1 , 3 - chains , which is synthesized by the predicted glycosyltransferase Tft1 ( Fontaine et al . , 2000 ; Samar et al . , 2015 ) . This b 1 , 4 - glucan moiety has also been observed in N . crassa ( Maddi and Free , 2010 ) . Most (cid:12)lamentous fungi ( including M . oryzae ) have just a single b 1 , 3 - glucan synthase , the deletion of which is assumed to be lethal , although this is based on limited experimen - tal data ( Oliveira - Garcia and Deising , 2013 ) . A notable exception is A . fumigatus , where a viable deletion strain of FKS1 was successfully generated , which demonstrated extremely reduced growth , and lethality in combination with inhibitors of septum formation ( Dichtl et al . , 2015 ) . In other fungi , lethality can be avoided by reducing expression of FKS1 by RNAi , rather than deleting the gene ( Mouyna et al . , 2004 ) . In these cases , defects are ob - served consistent with catastrophic loss of cell wall integrity , for example hyphal bursting and loss of conidial viability in Fusarium solani ( Ha et al . , 2006 ) and ‘exploding’ appres - soria in the Maize pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola ( Oliveira - Garcia and Deising , 2013 ) . Given the essential role of b 1 , 3 - glucan in maintaining cellular integrity , it is likely to be a component of the cell wall during all developmental stages of the fungal life - cycle . However , during pathogenic interactions , fragments of b 1 , 3 - glucan can be recognized by the host cells . This is true both in mammals , where fragments bind to Dectin - 1 ( Brown and Gordon , 2001 ) , and in plants , where linear or branched b 1 , 3 - glucan fragments are recognized by an unknown receptor ( Klarzynski et al . , 2000 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2000 ) . In both cases , the perception of b 1 , 3 - glucan as a foreign molecule ( or Pathogen Associ - ated Molecular Pattern ( PAMP ) ) has dire consequences for the fungus , as it results in the activation of PAMP - triggered immunity ( PTI ) , which allows the host to destroy or atten - uate the invading fungus . This presents pathogenic fungi with something of a dilemma : should they reduce the amount of b 1 , 3 - glucan in their walls in order to avoid detection but as a result compromise wall strength , or should they maintain strong walls but risk detection ? It appears that fungal pathogens have evolved a number of distinct strategies 19 to overcome this challenge . The (cid:12)rst involves the shielding of immunostimulatory cell wall components , a strategy common to many pathogenic fungi . This can be achieved by upregulation of another cell wall component , such as a 1 , 3 - glucan or chitosan , so that the b 1 , 3 - glucan is no longer exposed at the surface of the fungi ( these are discussed in detail later ) . In some fungi , walls are also covered by a layer of hydrophobins , which also act as a shield to prevent immune recognition ( Aimanianda et al . , 2009 ) . The second strategy , which is complementary to the (cid:12)rst , is to reduce the b 1 , 3 - glucan content of the cell wall . This was observed in C . graminocola , where a dramatic reduction in FKS1 expression during the biotrophic phase of infection occurred , whereas forced overexpression of FKS1 at this stage resulted exposure of b 1 , 3 - glucan on biotrophic hyphae and triggering of PTI ( Oliveira - Garcia and Deising , 2013 ) . The third potential strategy is to alter the molecu - lar composition of b 1 , 3 - glucan such that it can no longer be recognized by its receptor . Recent evidence suggests that b - glucan in the cell walls of C . albicans di(cid:11)ers according cell type : in yeast cells it is in a linear form ( b 1 , 3 - glucan with b 1 , 6 branches ) , whereas hyphal glucan demonstrated a unique , cyclical structure . Importantly , the hyphal form of glucan was a much more potent inducer of an immune response than the yeast form ( Lowman et al . , 2014 ) . However , there is no suggestion that this is a speci(cid:12)c strategy used by this fungus in order to avoid immune detection . Rather , this provides some evidence that changing the molecular structure of b 1 , 3 - glucan , perhaps by branching or cross - linking with other components could serve to render them less detectable . Further work is required to determine whether this is the case in other species of pathogenic fungi . The role of b 1 , 3 - glucan in the cell wall of pathogenic fungi perfectly illustrates the multifaceted nature of cell wall function in these species . As a structural component of the wall , b 1 , 3 - glucan is essential for wall integrity . On the other hand , b 1 , 3 - glucan is a PAMP and forms part of the ‘molecular dialogue’ between the fungal and host cells . The strategies outlined above demonstrate the ability of fungi to alter the composition of their cell walls in order to alter the outcome of this ‘molecular dialogue’ to their favour . As an essential component of the fungal cell wall , b 1 , 3 - glucan represents a valuable fungicide target and one that has already been exploited . The echinocandins are a group of synthetically modi(cid:12)ed lipopeptides which target b 1 , 3 - glucan synthase ( Denning , 2002 ) . The use of these drugs in clinical settings has led to more successful treatment of certain 20 invasive fungal infections ( Denning and Bromley , 2015 ) , though unfortunately some fungi exhibit inherent resistance to this class of fungicide ( e . g . Cryptococcus neoformans ) . Another problem is the prohibitive cost of caspofungins : treatment of an Aspergillus infection costs over $ 400 per day , per patient ( Saravolatz et al . , 2003 ) , making them unsuitable for use on crops , even without taking into consideration issues of stability and of plant uptake . Linked to b 1 , 3 - glucan is b 1 , 6 glucan , a minor component of the cell wall which com - prises only (cid:24) 10 % of total cell wall glucan in S . cerevisiae ( Manners et al . , 1973b ) . Inter - estingly , b 1 , 6 - glucan is absent in other species , including A . fumigatus ( Fontaine et al . , 2000 ) and N . crassa ( Maddi and Free , 2010 ) , but has been found in the cell wall of M . oryzae ( Samalova et al , unpublished results ) . Despite its relatively low abundance , b 1 , 6 - glucan has a crucial role in cross - linking adjacent b 1 , 3 - glucan chains , and serving as an attachment site for other cell wall components , such as chitin , GPI - anchored pro - teins and mannoproteins ( Cabib , 2009 ; Koll(cid:19)ar et al . , 1997 ) . However , neither the enzyme responsible nor the site of synthesis for this form of glucan have been identi(cid:12)ed conclu - sively . Nevertheless , mutational studies have identi(cid:12)ed a number of genes required for the synthesis of b 1 , 6 - glucan . For example , KRE6 and SKN1 encode functionally redundant , golgi - localized , glycosyl hydrolase 16 ( GH16 ) family proteins in S . cerevisiae . Deletion of these genes caused a dramatic reduction in b 1 , 6 - glucan levels and reduced growth , attesting to the critical role played by this polymer . Surprisingly , M . oryzae does not possess homologues of either of these proteins , despite b 1 , 6 - glucan being a component of the cell wall in this fungus ( Samalova et al , unpublished results ) . This suggests that either the mode of synthesis of this polymer may not be conserved in all fungi , or that these proteins only have an indirect role in its synthesis . Many other gene deletions a(cid:11)ecting synthesis of b 1 , 6 - glucan have been identi(cid:12)ed , which encode ER , Golgi or cell surface localized proteins ( reviewed in Shahinian and Bussey ( 2000 ) ) . These proteins are also unlikely to be directly involved in synthesis of the b 1 , 6 - glucan , but may be required for regulating secretion or for processing of proteins involved in b 1 , 6 glucan synthesis . As with KRE6 and SKN1 , deletion of these genes results in a reduction , but not complete loss , of b 1 , 6 - glucan and a concomitant growth defect . Some deletion combinations are lethal , for example when KRE9 and KNH1 are both deleted in S . cerevisiae ( Dijkgraaf 21 et al . , 1996 ) . Again , however , homologues of these proteins are not found in M . oryzae . The failure to identify a ‘ b 1 , 6 - glucan synthase’ could either be due to lethality , or the presence of multiple , functionally - redundant genes . Whichever the case , the synthesis of b 1 , 6 - glucan clearly represents an unexploited fungicide target and an inviting research opportunity . The last commonly occurring glucan moiety is a 1 , 3 - glucan , which is known to be a component of the cell wall in most fungi , although is absent in S . cerevisiae . Like b 1 , 3 - glucan , a 1 , 3 - glucan is synthesized at the plasma membrane by an integral membrane protein , a 1 , 3 - glucan synthase ( Ags ) , from a cytoplasmic pool of UDP - glucose . The a 1 , 3 - glucan found in fungal cell walls usually exists as a linear polymer , with short chains of a 1 , 4 - linked glucose interspersed between the longer a 1 , 3 - glucan sections . Interestingly , no linkages to other cell wall components have yet been identi(cid:12)ed ( Choma et al . , 2013 ) . This suggests that a 1 , 3 - glucan exists as an entirely separate , non - crosslinked component of the cell wall , unlike chitin and b 1 , 3 - glucan . The reasons for this ‘spatial’ isolation are unclear , but it could have important consequences for the physical properties of the cell wall . Ags enzymes are usually predicted to have two catalytic domains : an intracellular domain for the synthesis of a 1 , 3 glucan , and an N - terminal extracellular domain with a possible role in catalyzing transglycosylation reactions between a - glucan chains ( Free , 2013 ) . AGS genes have been characterized in a number of di(cid:11)erent species of fungi , revealing that a 1 , 3 - glucan has diverse roles , depending on the species and cell - type in question . In the (cid:12)ssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , a 1 , 3 - glucan comprises approximately one - third of total glucans ( Bush et al . , 1974 ) . Deletion of AGS in this fungus revealed a 1 , 3 glucan is essential for cellular morphogenesis and integrity ; conditional mutants of AGS1 underwent cell lysis at restrictive temperatures and failed to maintain rod - like shapes ( Hochstenbach et al . , 1998 ) . In N . crassa a 1 , 3 - glucan is component of the cell wall in aerial hyphae and conidia , but not vegetative hyphae , suggesting that in this fungus a 1 , 3 - glucan is speci(cid:12)c to certain developmental stages . By deletion of AGS1 , it was shown that a 1 , 3 - glucan is required for conidial development ( Fu et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast , loss of a 1 , 3 - glucan in other fungi does not result in developmental defects or loss of integrity . For example , knockdown of AGS1 in Histoplasma capsulatum had no e(cid:11)ect on growth in vitro ( Rappleye et al . , 2004 ) . Similarly , a triple deletion of all three AGS genes in A . fumigatus 22 had no e(cid:11)ect on the growth of the fungus ( Henry et al . , 2012 ) . This is despite the complete loss of a 1 , 3 - glucan , which constitutes up to 40 % of total cell wall polysaccharides in this species ( Maubon et al . , 2006 ) . Lastly , a recent study in M . oryzae revealed that a 1 , 3 - glucan was a component of the cell wall in germ tubes and appressoria , but that loss of this component did not a(cid:11)ect morphogenesis ( Fujikawa et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , a 1 , 3 - glucan is not required for cellular integrity or morphogenesis in H . capsulatum , A . fumigatus or M . oryzae in vitro . Intriguingly however , when the pathogenicity of the AGS deletion strains in these species was tested in their respective hosts it was found to be severely reduced . In all cases , the invasion of the host by a fungus lacking a 1 , 3 - glucan resulted in activation of defense responses , which were presumably su(cid:14)cient to prevent successful colonisation by the pathogen ( Rappleye et al . , 2007 ; Beauvais et al . , 2013 ; Fujikawa et al . , 2012 ) . These studies provide strong evidence that a 1 , 3 - glucan operates as a ‘stealth mechanism’ in these pathogens , as discussed previously ; the presence of a 1 , 3 - glucan on the outer part of the cell wall prevents exposure of PAMPs in the cell wall , such as b 1 , 3 - glucan . Thus , the pathogens remain undetected and can successfully colonize the host . As an essential cell wall component for successful host infection in these fungi , the inhibition of a 1 , 3 - glucan synthases has been proposed as a valuable fungicide target . Although none have yet been developed to inhibit this enzyme , an alternative approach has been tested in rice plants ( Fujikawa et al . , 2012 ) . The expression of a 1 , 3 - glucanase in rice plants provided resistance to not only M . oryzae , but also to Cochliobolus miyabeanus and Rhizoctonia solani , suggesting that a 1 , 3 - glucan acts as a protective layer in these distantly - related species too . Transgenic crops producing a 1 , 3 - glucanase could therefore represent a novel strategy to confer broad - spectrum fungal resistance . Chitin synthesis The synthesis of chitin is perhaps the most studied aspect of the fungal cell wall . Chitin , a polymer of b 1 , 4 - N - acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc ) is synthesized from a cytoplasmic pool of UDP - GlcNAc , by a conserved family of enzymes known as chitin synthases ( CHS ) . These are glycosyl transferase enzymes , with multiple transmembrane domains which localize them to the plasma membrane . Based on their amino acid sequences , the chitin synthase family can be subdivided into seven classes ( I - VII ) , although di(cid:11)erent studies have created 23 con(cid:13)icting classi(cid:12)cations ( Riquelme and Bartnicki - Garc(cid:19)(cid:16)a , 2008 ) . Domain architecture of the chitin synthases di(cid:11)ers according to the class to which the enzyme belongs . Classes I - III have a type - 1 Chitin Synthase domain ( Pfam 01644 ) at their N - terminus , preceded by a Chitin Synthase N - terminal domain ( Pfam 08407 ) , as well as a conserved portion of the Chitin Synthase - 2 domain ( Pfam 03142 ) . Classes IV - VII have the full Chitin Synthase - 2 domain , which is preceded by a cytochrome b5 domain ( Pfam 00173 ) in classes IV , V and VII . Lastly , classes V and VII also have a myosin motor domain ( Pfam 00063 ) at their N - terminus ( Riquelme and Bartnicki - Garc(cid:19)(cid:16)a , 2008 ) . Interestingly , the number of chitin synthase sequences present in fungal genomes is highly variable . Numbers range from just a single chitin synthase in fungi such as S . pombe , to over 20 in species of Rhizopus . Such discrepancies likely re(cid:13)ect the higher chitin content of certain fungal species’ cell walls , as well as more complex and varied cellular morphologies . Unlike glucans , chitin is a highly crystalline polymer , in which individual chains are assembled into micro(cid:12)brils through extensive inter - chain hydrogen bonding . This can give rise to three di(cid:11)erent crystalline forms of chitin : a , b , and g , where the individual chitin chains are assembled in a parallel , anti - parallel or parallel / anti - parallel fashion respectively ( Blackwell , 1969 ; Minke and Blackwell , 1978 ; Jang et al . , 2004 ) . However , a - chitin is the form that is found in fungal cell walls ( Lenardon et al . , 2010 ) . Chitin plays a critical role in maintaining the strength and rigidity of the cell wall , despite constituting only 1 - 2 % of total cell wall mass in S . cerevisiae ( Klis , 1994 ) , and 10 - 20 % in (cid:12)lamentous fungi ( Kong et al . , 2012 ; Muszkieta et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast to glucan synthesis , where typically a single enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of all b 1 , 3 - or a 1 , 3 - glucan in the cell wall , the synthesis of chitin is performed by several di(cid:11)erent chitin synthases which appear to have spatially and temporally - speci(cid:12)c roles . This is perhaps best exempli(cid:12)ed in S . cerevisiae , where there are three chitin synthases ( Chs1 - 3 ) . Chs3 is responsible for the synthesis of the majority of cell wall chitin , at the base of emerging buds and the lateral wall , whereas Chs1 and Chs2 have roles in wall repair and septum synthesis respectively ( Shaw et al . , 1991 ; Bulawa and Osmond , 1990 ; Cabib et al . , 1989 ) . C . albicans has four chitin synthases , Chs1 , Chs2 , Chs3 and Chs8 . As in S . cerevisiae , these enzymes have distinct and speci(cid:12)c roles . Chs1 synthesises the primary septum , and is unique amongst chitin synthases in being an essential gene ( Munro et al . , 2001 ) . Chs3 synthesizes the 24 majority of cell wall chitin during yeast and hyphal growth . The roles of Chs2 and Chs8 have only recently been conclusively established ; they synthesize chitin at polarized sites and septa , as well as in response to cell wall stress ( Preechasuth et al . , 2015 ) . Genes encoding chitin synthases are typically more numerous in (cid:12)lamentous ascomycetes such as M . oryzae . Gene deletion of individual chitin synthases have been performed in a wide range of species , including Botrytis cinerea ( Souli(cid:19)e et al . , 2003 , 2006 ) , Fusarium oxys - porum ( Mart(cid:19)(cid:16)n - Urd(cid:19)(cid:16)roz et al . , 2008 ) , Colletotrichum graminicola ( Werner et al . , 2007 ) , and Aspergillus nidulans ( Horiuchi et al . , 1999 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2000 ; Takeshita et al . , 2006 ) . These studies have revealed a whole host of defects associated with the loss of individual chitin synthase genes , but a consistent trend is that those containing a myosin motor domain ( classes V and VII ) appeared to be the most important for normal hyphal growth and pathogenicity . However , these studies neglect a signi(cid:12)cant proportion of the chitin synthase family , since they tend to focus on those that result in a clear phenotype when deleted . Systematic deletion and analysis of the entire chitin synthase family has only been performed in a handful of species . Analysis of all 7 CHS deletion strains in M . oryzae revealed that as in S . cerevisiae , di(cid:11)erent Chs enzymes have developmentally speci(cid:12)c roles , although with some apparent overlap between them ( Kong et al . , 2012 ) . For example , deletion of CHS7 results in normal vegetative growth , but loss of appressorium development on arti(cid:12)cial surfaces , suggesting that this enzyme is speci(cid:12)cally required for the synthesis of chitin in the appressorium . Chs1 ( class III ) is also required for normal appressorium development , but appears to have an important role in conidiation too , as well as in plant penetration . Chs6 ( class VII ) is required for normal hyphal growth and plant penetration , although chs6 strains are also reduced in conidiation . The precise roles of other Chs ( Chs3 , Chs4 , Chs5 ) were less clear however , with some only showing slightly reduced hyphal growth under certain stress conditions . This may indicate a role in cell wall repair . CHS deletion strains have also been characterized in other species of fungi , including N . crassa and A . fumigatus ( Fajardo - Somera et al . , 2015 ; Muszkieta et al . , 2014 ) . In N . crassa , which also has 7 CHS genes , Chs6 ( class VI ) was implicated in hyphal growth and ascospore formation , CHS5 ( class V ) in growth of aerial hyphae , coni - diation and ascospore formation and CHS3 ( class I ) in perithecia development whereas deletion strains of CHS7 ( class VII ) had defects in all of the above processes ( Fajardo - 25 Somera et al . , 2015 ) ( note : numbering of CHS between fungi is not consistent i . e . Chs1 in M . oryzae is not equivalent to Chs1 in N . crassa ) . A . fumigatus has 8 CHS genes , which have also been studied by systematic deletion ( Fajardo - Somera et al . , 2015 ) . The (cid:12)ndings of this study were broadly similar to those conducted in M . oryzae and N . crassa , in that deletion of some chitin synthases ( in this case either alone or in combination ) had little e(cid:11)ect , whereas deletion of other chitin synthases had a severe impact on fungal growth and development . For example , deletion of CSMA , a class V Chs , resulted in multiple de - fects including cell wall disorganization and reduced hyphal growth . On the other hand , triple deletion of CHSA / C / B had little e(cid:11)ect . From these data , it is clear that chitin is a vital component of the cell wall at all stages of fungal development , and it is synthesized by multiple chitin synthases that have both speci(cid:12)c and overlapping roles . However , it is also apparent from the aforementioned studies that chitin synthases from the same class do not necessarily have conserved function across di(cid:11)erent species ( Fajardo - Somera et al . , 2015 ) . There are numerous possible reasons behind the requirement for multiple chitin syn - thases , in contrast with the single copies of b 1 , 3 - glucan synthases found in most fungi . Certainly , multiple genes allows for di(cid:11)erent transcriptional regulation of the chitin syn - thases and cell - type speci(cid:12)c expression , a concept that is supported by experimental data . These di(cid:11)erent enzymes are likely to produce unique forms of chitin , leading to deposition of chitin with di(cid:11)erent physical or chemical properties , according to cellular requirements or sub - cellular location . Evidence for this has been found in C . albicans . Here , two forms of chitin (cid:12)brils were detected . The majority of cell wall chitin was composed of short microcrystalline rodlets , synthesized by Chs3 . However , in bud scars and septa , chitin existed in longer , intertwined (cid:12)brils which were synthesized by Chs8 ( Lenardon et al . , 2007 ) . Functional interaction with other cell wall enzymes is another possibility - cer - tain chitin synthases may either interact directly with other enzymes involved in chitin metabolism ( e . g . chitinase , chitin deacetylase ) , or enzymes in the cell wall may only process chitin produced by a certain class of chitin synthase . These possibilities have yet to be widely explored . Lastly , di(cid:11)erent chitin synthase enzymes may direct synthesis of chitin at a particular subcellular location . The localization of chitin synthases by (cid:13)u - orescent tagging has provided some evidence for this , thereby complementing the gene 26 deletion studies and revealing further aspects of chitin synthesis and regulation . Early work was once again performed in S . cerevisiae , where GFP - tagging , immuno(cid:13)u - orescence and cell - fractionation studies of Chs3 and Chs1 revealed two distinct locations for these enzymes . As expected , Chs3 and Chs1 localized to the plasma membrane . In addition however , both proteins were also found in endocytically derived intracellu - lar compartments that were named as chitosomes ( Chuang and Schekman , 1996 ; Ziman et al . , 1996 ; Zanolari et al . , 2011 ) . Further work to characterize the role of these chito - somes in chitin synthesis discovered that they represented an intracellular store of Chs3 , whereby enzyme could be transported to and from the plasma membrane as required ( Valdivia and Schekman , 2003 ) . Chitin synthases have also been localized in a number of (cid:12)lamentous fungi . In M . oryzae , GFP - tagged Chs7 localized to the tips of germ tubes and to developing appressoria ( Odenbach et al . , 2009 ) , whereas GFP - tagged Chs1 localized to hyphal tips and developing conidia ( Kong et al . , 2012 ) . As in S . cerevisiae , (cid:13)uorescence was observed in intracellular bodies as well as the cell periphery , although further insights into the signi(cid:12)cance of this were not pursued . More detailed work has been performed in N . crassa , where Chs1 , Chs2 , Chs4 , Chs5 and Chs7 have all been successfully localized ( Fajardo - Somera et al . , 2015 ) . All of these CHS were localized in growing vegetative hyphae , where (cid:13)uorescence was observed at the Spitzenk(cid:127)orper , at forming septa and in populations of intracellular bodies which could be equivalent to the chitosomes originally identi(cid:12)ed in S . cerevisiae . Interestingly , only partial colocalization of Chs1 - mCherry with Chs2 - eGFP or Chs5 - eGFP occurred at the Spitzenk(cid:127)orper , and Chs2 also showed a unique septal pore localization . In Ustilago maydis , all chitin synthases localize to hyphal septa and Chs5 , Chs6 , Chs7 and Mcs1 also localize to apical regions ( Weber et al . , 2006 ) . Fur - ther analysis of Mcs1 , a class V Chs , provided a valuable insight into the role played by myosin motor domains in chitin synthases . It was found that deletion of this do - main did not alter long - distance transport of Mcs1 by microtubules , but was required for apical - localization and exocytosis of the enzyme ( Treitschke et al . , 2010 ) . Taken together , these localization studies provide some support for the notion of functional specialization within the chitin synthase family . The localization of chitin synthases to intracellular ‘chitosomes’ also suggests an additional layer of regulation that allows the synthesis of chitin to be dynamically and spatially regulated . 27 The cycling of CHS between intracellular stores ( chitosomes and / or Spitzenk(cid:127)orper ) and the plasma membrane appears to be a conserved mechanism in fungi which presum - ably allows rapid and dynamic control of chitin synthesis according to cellular require - ments ( e . g . to drive growth , or in response to stress conditions ) . This phenomenon poses signi(cid:12)cant questions , especially regarding how transport of Chs to and from the plasma membrane occurs and how this process is regulated . As is often the case , investigations in S . cerevisiae have supplied some answers to these questions . Chs3 was found to be main - tained in an intracellular pool by cycling between the trans - golgi network ( TGN ) and early endosomes ( Santos and Snyder , 1997 ; Valdivia et al . , 2002 ) . Exit of Chs3 from the TGN / early endosomes and transport to the plasma membrane is dependant upon pro - teins such as the TGN - localized Chs5 and the exomer component Chs6 , which may form a protein - sorting complex to guide the loading of Chs3 into secretory vesicles ( Santos and Snyder , 1997 ; Ziman et al . , 1998 ; Sanchatjate and Schekman , 2006 ) . Interestingly , these proteins are not required for normal transport of Chs1 , suggesting that Chs1 and Chs3 are packaged by separate mechanisms that may maintain the compositional heterogeneity of the chitosome population . Once delivered to the plasma membrane , additional factors are required for the regu - lation of the activity and localization of the chitin synthases . Chs4 is a prenylated protein that interacts directly with Chs3 , and also with the sca(cid:11)old protein Bni4 , thereby indi - rectly anchoring Chs3 to septins ( DeMarini et al . , 1997 ) . This interaction is required for the localization of Chs3 at the bud neck , as well as for the activity of Chs3 although the mechanism behind this activation is unknown . Thus , Chs4 is known as a chitin syn - thase regulator , and these proteins are conserved in all species of fungi . In contrast to the wealth of knowledge acquired in S . cerevisiae , very little is known of factors regulating Chs tra(cid:14)cking and localization in (cid:12)lamentous fungal species , although it would appear that secretion does not occur via the traditional ER / golgi secretory pathway ( Riquelme and Bartnicki - Garc(cid:19)(cid:16)a , 2008 ) . This therefore represents a valuable research opportunity , and one that could potentially result in the discovery of novel fungicide targets . The chitin synthases themselves are already targets for some fungicides : nikkomycins and polyoxins are nucleoside - peptide analogues of UDP - GlcNAc that act as a competitive inhibitors of fungal and insect chitin synthases ( Ruiz - Herrera and San - Blas , 2003 ) . Polyoxin D is 28 currently marketed by Certis USA L . L . C . as Tavano TM and OSO TM for use on numerous soft fruit and vegetable crops ( Certis , 2015 ) . Nikkomycin Z is not used in agricultural contexts , but has been shown to be e(cid:11)ective in reducing infection by Histoplasma capsu - latum and Coccidioides immitis in mouse models ( Hector et al . , 1990 ) , and is currently undergoing clinical trials ( Denning and Bromley , 2015 ) . However , one signi(cid:12)cant draw - back of these fungicides is that not all chitin synthases show equal sensitivity , for example in S . cerevisiae the order of sensitivity to nikkomycin Z is Chs1 > Chs3 > Chs2 . The lack of sensitivity of Chs2 explains why growth S . cerevisiae is not signi(cid:12)cantly inhibited by treatment with nikkomycin Z , as it is able to compensate for Chs3 inhibition ( Gaughran et al . , 1994 ) . Many other fungi ( e . g . A . fumigatus ) show similar insensitivity to chitin synthase inhibitors , presumably for the same reason , although cell permeability and in - tracellular stability of the fungicides must also be considered . Further investigations are therefore required , in order improve the spectrum of fungal species that can be targeted by inhibition of chitin synthesis . Glucan and chitin remodelling Once synthesized by their respective enzymes , chitin and glucan are not simply inert and separate components of the cell wall . Their structure and relationship with other cell wall components is altered by a variety of carbohydrate modifying enzymes in order to create a rigid and interconnected polysaccharide matrix . These include enzymes involved in glucan chain branching , glucan elongation and chitin - glucan cross - linking . The hydrolysis of glucan and chitin is discussed later , in Chapter 5 . The elongation of b 1 , 3 - glucan chains is performed by GPI - anchored b 1 , 3 - glucanosyl - transferase enzymes belonging to the Glycosyl Hydrolase 72 family ( GH72 ) . These en - zymes cleave a b 1 , 3 - glucan chain and transfer it to the non - reducing end of another b 1 , 3 - glucan molecule , thereby creating a new b 1 , 3 linkage ( Mouyna et al . , 2000 ) . In S . cerevisiae , there are 5 b 1 , 3 - glucanosyltransferase enzymes ( named Gas1 - 5 ) , of which Gas1 is the best characterized . Deletion strains of GAS1 showed slightly altered cell morphology , reduced glucan content , hypersensitivity to Calco(cid:13)uor White and shed glu - can from their cell wall ( Ram et al . , 1995 , 1998 ) . However , the remaining 4 GAS genes have not yet been fully characterized , although GAS2 and GAS4 appear to function 29 in ascospore formation , and GAS5 is coexpressed with GAS1 during vegetative growth ( Ragni et al . , 2007a ; Primig et al . , 2000 ) . It is therefore likely that redundancy exists within the GAS family in this species . In Aspergillus fumigatus , which has 7 putative b 1 , 3 - glucanosyltransferases ( named Gels 1 - 7 ) , the enzymatic function of GH72 proteins is conserved , and both GEL1 and GEL2 can complement the S . cerevisiae gas1 strain ( Mouyna et al . , 2000 , 2005 ) . In contrast to S . cerevisiae , deletion of even a single GEL resulted in serious growth defects : a gel2 strain showed reduced mycelial growth , cell wall disorganization , abnormal conidiogenesis and reduced virulence ( Mouyna et al . , 2005 ) . Surprisingly , a later study demonstrated that deletion of GEL4 was lethal , suggesting that i ) redundancy may not exist between members of the GH72 family in this species and ii ) that GH72 family proteins play a vital role in development in (cid:12)lamentous fungi ( Gastebois et al . , 2010a ) . Recent unpublished work in M . oryzae has shown that redun - dancy is an issue when studying the 5 Gels present in this species , but that a triple GEL1 / GEL3 / GEL4 knockout is non - pathogenic , displays severe , osmoremedial hyphal growth defects and reduced glucan chain length ( Samalova et al , unpublished results ) . These studies all suggest that glucan chain elongation is critical for the correct assembly of b 1 , 3 - glucan in the cell wall , and is therefore crucial for fungal development . However , it is unclear as to exactly why this is the case . One possibility is that shorter b 1 , 3 - glucan chains simply have lower mechanical strength , as they are able to slide past each other more easily under stress . Additionally , chain elongation also reduces the number of termi - nal residues to which chitin or b 1 , 6 - glucan can be attached , which is hypothesized to have profound morphogenic consequences ( Cabib and Arroyo , 2013 ) . Despite these intriguing hypotheses , questions still remain regarding the spatial and temporal factors controlling glucan elongation . For example , are glucan chains in certain cell types or subcellular locations of a di(cid:11)erent length than those in others , and if so , what are the consequences of this on the properties of the cell wall ? At what stage in glucan synthesis does elon - gation by Gels occur - do Gels colocalize with active b 1 , 3 - glucan synthase ? Clearly , the answers to some of these questions may not be attainable with current techniques , and so technological and methodological advances will likely play a role in driving novel research in this area . b 1 , 3 - glucan , although synthesized as linear chains , does not remain so in the cell wall . 30 As mentioned previously , the b 1 , 3 - glucan chains are branched by the presence of b 1 , 6 - linkages . An enzyme with glucan - branching activity was (cid:12)rst isolated from C . albicans and characterized in vitro . The enzyme ( named Bgl2 ) , displayed both hydrolytic and glucosyltransferase activities , (cid:12)rst cleaving the reducing end of a b 1 , 3 - glucan chain , then linking the removed oligosaccharide to the b 1 , 3 - glucan chain via a b 1 , 6 - linkage ( Hart - land et al . , 1991 ) . Deletion of BGL2 in this fungus resulted in reduced virulence and increased sensitivity to nikkomycin Z , suggesting an increase in chitin content ( Sarthy et al . , 1997 ) . Similarly , deletion of BGL2 in S . cerevisiae also resulted in an increase in cell wall chitin content , although growth and cell morphology were una(cid:11)ected ( Kalebina et al . , 2003 ) . Investigations of this enzyme family are extremely limited in (cid:12)lamentous fungi . In A . fumigatus , two enzymes ( Bgt1 and Bgt2 ) with similar glucosyltransferase activity to Bgl2 were characterized biochemically and deletion strains created ( Gastebois et al . , 2010b ) . Surprisingly , no phenotype was detected in either the single or double deletion strains compared to WT , nor any change in glucan branching . This suggests that , as with many enzyme families , redundancy may be preventing the study of the true phenotype . It is also likely that compensatory mechanisms allow the cell to adjust to the loss of an enzyme , by altering the composition of the cell wall e . g . increasing chitin content , as observed in S . cerevisiae and C . albicans . Chitin and b - glucan chains can be cross - linked by a family of GPI - anchored GH16 enzymes (cid:12)rst characterized in S . cerevisiae ( Rodr(cid:19)(cid:16)guez - Pe ~ na et al . , 2000 ) . These enzymes ( named Crh1 and Crh2 ) were shown to act as transglycosylases , catalyzing the trans - fer of chitin chains ( synthesized by CHS3 ) to both b 1 , 3 - glucan and b 1 , 6 - glucan ( Cabib , 2009 ) . By studying the localization of GFP - tagged Crh1 and Crh2 and the incorporation of (cid:13)uorescently - labelled laminari - oligosaccharides , this activity was shown to localize to bud sites and bud scars , which is coincident with the main site of chitin synthesis by CHS3 ( Cabib et al . , 2008 ) . Deletion of CRH1 and CRH2 resulted in the loss of glucan - linked chitin and hypersensitivity to the cell wall disruptants Calco(cid:13)uor White and Congo Red , suggesting defective wall organization and integrity ( Cabib , 2009 ; Rodr(cid:19)(cid:16)guez - Pe ~ na et al . , 2000 ) . Intriguingly , cell wall remodelling by these enzymes is hypothesized to have a critical role in in(cid:13)uencing cellular morphogenesis in fungi . It has been proposed that linkage of chitin to glucan prevents further remodelling of the glucan , as the chitin 31 occupies the non - reducing ends of the b 1 , 3 - glucan that would normally be occupied by b 1 , 6 - glucan and its associated mannoproteins . As a result , growth of the cell wall is pre - vented at these sites , namely the bud neck in S . cerevisiae ( Cabib and Arroyo , 2013 ) . This model implies that cellular morphogenesis is in(cid:13)uenced by the interrelationship between the various components of the cell wall , as well as by their initial synthesis . However , it is also important to consider the direct consequences that such cell wall remodelling may have on the physical properties of the cell wall . It was recently demonstrated in C . albicans that simultaneous deletion of three genes encoding GH16 enzymes ( CRH11 , CRH12 and UTR2 ) resulted in increased wall elasticity and consequently , reduced resis - tance to hyperosmotic stress ( Ene et al . , 2015 ) . The GH16 family of transglycosylases has yet to be systematically investigated in other species of (cid:12)lamentous fungi , although recent work in M . oryzae has characterized single and double deletion strains of the GH16 family . This revealed roles in cell wall organization and integrity during mycelial and in planta growth , although redundancy is likely to be a factor in this species , as there are 5 putative Crh members ( Che - Omar et al , unpublished results ) . Thus , further work is required to investigate the how these enzymes might in(cid:13)uence the physical properties of the cell wall and morphogenesis in M . oryzae . Taken together , these studies support the notion that the initial synthesis of the core cell wall components is just the beginning of the complex process of cell wall biogenesis . Given the severe phenotypes observed when cell wall remodelling genes are deleted , it is clear that the modi(cid:12)cation of chitin and glucan in the wall is equally as important as the initial synthesis itself . However , the relationship between cell wall remodelling , the phys - ical properties of the cell wall and cellular morphogenesis is complex and requires further investigation . The relationships between di(cid:11)erent types of wall remodelling enzymes also needs to be determined . It is known that , in the absence of one particular remodelling enzyme , another can be upregulated to compensate . For example , in the gas1 mutant of S . cerevisiae , a number of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and remodelling are upregulated , including CRH1 and BGL2 ( Lagorce et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , the cross - linking or branching of glucans may demonstrate at least partial redundancy of function with glucan elongation . Understanding these relationships could be key to deciphering the roles of the di(cid:11)erent forms of cell remodelling . The key steps of elongation , branching 32 and cross - linking clearly represent potential targets for fungicides that at present remain unexploited . There are also likely to be many remodelling enzymes that are currently unknown , for example those involved in integrating b 1 , 6 - glucan chains or mannan into the cell wall . Some such enzymes may even be class - or genus - speci(cid:12)c , since many species of fungi contain novel linkages that do not appear to be broadly conserved . Further in - vestigations in this (cid:12)eld will require considerable ingenuity and novel techniques , in order to detect the activities and phenotypes of remodelling enzymes which are not always forthcoming . Chitin deacetylation A unique feature of chitin ( b 1 , 4 - N - acetylglucosamine ) is that it can be deacetylated by a family of carbohydrate esterase enzymes known as chitin deacetylases ( CDA ) to form chitosan , a polymer of b 1 , 4 - glucosamine ( Figure 1 . 3 ) . There is , however , no strict de(cid:12)nition of the degree of deacetylation that needs to be achieved in order for a polymer to be described as chitosan rather than chitin . In fact , it is likely that a complete spectrum of chitin / chitosan polymers exist in nature , potentially demonstrating anywhere between 0 and 100 % deacetylation . As well as the overall degree of deacetylation , the pattern of deacetylated residues probably also varies , depending on both the enzymatic mechanism of deacetylation and the nature of the substrate ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) . For example , an exo - type CDA from Mucor rouxii was shown to fully deacetylate chitin oligomers in a multiple - attack mechanism ( Tsigos et al . , 1999 ) whereas a CDA from Colletotrichum lindemuthianum only partially deacetylates chitin oligomers ( Tokuyasu et al . , 1997 ) . Although informative , these studies have a signi(cid:12)cant limitation in that enzymatic activity is tested on short oligomers of chitin which do not represent the native form of chitin found in fungal cell walls , which is most likely to be crystalline . Interestingly , all CDAs tested so far have demonstrated very low activity on crystalline chitin in vitro , presumably due to the inaccessibility of the substrate ( Win and Stevens , 2001 ) . This suggests that in vivo , either a ) chitin is deacetylated soon after synthesis , prior to crystallisation b ) additional proteins or enzymes may act in concert with CDAs to increase substrate accessibility , or c ) some chitin synthases synthesize chitin that does not crystallize , allowing it to be deacetylated later . Of course , it is possible that all of the 33 above may be true to some degree , although at present there is little evidence to either support or refute any of these hypotheses . Figure 1 . 3 : Cartoon of chitin deacetylation . Chitin deacetylases ( green ) remove acetyl groups from the N - acetylglucosamine residues of chitin ( red ) , producing a polymer known as chitosan . CDAs may either deacetylate nascent chitin chains , prior to crystallization , or act upon crystalline micro(cid:12)brillar chitin . Chitin deacetylases are conserved in all fungi ( Ruiz - Herrera and Ortiz - Castellanos , 2010 ) , suggesting that chitosan plays a role in the cell wall of most species , at least dur - ing some part of their life - cycle . The purpose of chitin deacetylation likely relates to the relative physical and chemical properties of chitin and chitosan . Chitin , as described previously , is a rigid , crystalline polymer with low chemical reactivity . However , deacety - lation creates primary amine groups . With a pKa value of 6 . 7 , this means that some of these amine groups are protonated and charged at physiological pH . Consequently , chitosan is a polycationic , more hydrophilic and non - crystalline polysaccharide , in stark contrast to its parent polymer chitin . This could have profound consequences on the structure and properties of the fungal cell wall . On the one hand , chitosan is theoret - ically much more (cid:13)exible than chitin . On the other , the newly exposed amine groups could be free to interact with other cell wall components in an ionic or covalent manner , potentially increasing wall rigidity . At present , there is little data to support either of these hypotheses , as the role of chitin deacetylation has only been investigated in a few species of fungi . The role of chitin deacetylation was (cid:12)rst described in S . cerevisiae . Here , there are two functionally redundant CDAs which deacetylate chitin speci(cid:12)cally in the cell wall of ascospores ( Mishra et al . , 1997 ; Christodoulidou et al . , 1996 ) . Deletion of the two genes together resulted in complete loss of chitosan from the ascospore wall . Although formation and viability of the ascospores themselves was una(cid:11)ected , spores of the double 34 deletion strain were shown to be more susceptible to treatment with lysing enzymes , ether and heat shock , suggesting possible disorganization and increased permeability of the ascospore wall . This was con(cid:12)rmed through further experimentation , which showed that the outer dityrosine layer was absent in CDA deletion strains , although unexpectedly total chitin content was also lower ( Christodoulidou et al . , 1999 ) . It was hypothesized subsequently that the dityrosine is cross - linked to the amine groups of the chitosan , thereby creating a rigid and impermeable ascospore cell wall , although no direct evidence for this has been presented ( Suda et al . , 2009 ) . In Schizosaccharomyces pombe , a single CDA was also expressed speci(cid:12)cally during sporulation , as in S . cerevisiae . The deletion of CDA1 resulted in slightly reduced sporulation ( Matsuo et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , chitosan was shown to be a component of spore wall in Ashbya gossypii . Surprisingly , deletion of the single CDA in this species resulted in a complete loss of sporulation , suggesting that chitosan is required for spore development . On the other hand , (cid:12)lamentous growth of the fungus was entirely una(cid:11)ected ( Lickfeld and Schmitz , 2012 ) . In both S . cerevisiae and S . pombe , the defects arising from CDA deletion are similar , if not as severe , as deletion of a chitin synthase ( encoding Chs3 in S . cerevisiae and Chs1 in S . pombe ) . This suggests that the CDAs speci(cid:12)cally deacetylate the chitin make by those particular CHS , perhaps indicating a degree of collaboration between CDAs and CHS . The (cid:12)nal species in which detailed characterization of CDAs has been performed is C . neoformans , where chitosan is actually 3 - 5 times more abundant than chitin in the cell wall of vegetatively growing cells ( Banks et al . , 2005 ) . Deletion of 3 of the 4 CDA genes ( CDA1 - 3 ) in this fungus is su(cid:14)cient to completely abolish chitosan synthesis ( Baker et al . , 2007 ) . These triple deletion strains are more susceptible to various cell wall perturbants , including Congo Red , SDS , ca(cid:11)eine and NaCl , are less virulent and also leak melanin from their cell walls ( Baker et al . , 2011 ) . Together , these (cid:12)ndings suggest that chitosan has an important role in cell wall integrity in this fungus . In addition , and consistent with (cid:12)ndings in S . cerevisiae and S . pombe , deletion of one particular chitin synthase ( Chs3 ) also results in complete loss of chitosan . This is despite the presence of 8 di(cid:11)erent chitin synthase enzymes in C . neoformans , some of which are expressed at the same stage of development , supporting the hypothesis of CHS - CDA collaboration ( Banks et al . , 2005 ) . Further to this , it was also found that the GPI - anchor of Cda2 , and therefore plasma membrane 35 localization , is required for chitosan synthesis by this enzyme ( Gilbert et al . , 2012 ) . The GPI - anchor could conceivably serve to place Cda2 in close proximity to Chs3 , so that deacetylation of nascent chitin can take place . From the studies outlined above , it is clear that chitosan plays an important role in fungal development and cell wall integrity , although exactly how this relates to the unique properties of chitosan remains unclear . In addition , no such studies have yet been conducted in phytopathogenic fungi , and it is likely that there is an extra dimension to the role of chitosan in these species . Chitin is a well - characterized PAMP that is rec - ognized in rice plant cells by the Pattern Recognition Receptor ( PRR ) , CEBiP ( Chitin Elicitor Binding Protein ) ( Shimizu et al . , 2010 ) . The release of chitin oligomers from fungal cell walls either as a result of endogenous cell wall remodelling enzymes , or due to the action of plant chitinases results in binding of these oligomers to CEBiP . This induces dimerization of CEBiP and association with CERK1 ( Chitin Elicitor Receptor Kinase - 1 ) , resulting in phosphorylation and activation of CEBiP ( Hayafune et al . , 2014 ) . Activation of a pattern recognition receptor such as CEBiP triggers PAMP Triggered Immunity ( PTI ) , resulting in a range of responses including production of reactive oxy - gen species ( ROS ) and hydrolytic enzymes ( glucanases and chitinases ) , callose deposition and accumulation of salicylic acid ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) . All of the above prevent successful colonization of the plant by the invading fungus . However , the fungi themselves appear to have evolved two ways of preventing chitin from triggering PTI . The (cid:12)rst is the se - cretion of chitin - binding e(cid:11)ectors , which compete with the chitin receptors for binding of chitin oligomers . These have been shown to be necessary for the full pathogenicity of a number of fungal species , including Cladosporium fulvum and M . oryzae ( de Jonge et al . , 2010 ; Mentlak et al . , 2012 ) . The second strategy is the deacetylation of chitin to chitosan , which has two hypothesized bene(cid:12)ts . The (cid:12)rst is that unlike chitin , chitosan is not a PAMP and cannot cause activation of CEBiP ( Hayafune et al . , 2014 ) . Although several studies have shown that chitosan can actually induce a defence response in plant cells , this is most likely a non - speci(cid:12)c response due to the polycationic nature of chi - tosan which causes membrane disruption ( Lin et al . , 2005 ; Agrawal et al . , 2002 ; Zuppini et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , the concentrations of chitosan required to induce such re - sponses in these studies is many times higher than for chitin , bringing into question the 36 physiological relevance of these observations . The second bene(cid:12)t of chitin deacetylation is that it provides protection from plant chitinases , since chitosan is a poor substrate for these enzymes . Thus , the conversion of chitin to chitosan is hypothesized have two interlinked roles during fungal pathogenesis : i ) to prevent fungal cell wall degradation by plant chitinases and ii ) to avoid activation of pattern triggered immunity ( i . e . to act as a ‘stealth mechanism’ ) . Although there is no functional evidence for these roles of chitosan in plant - pathogen interactions , circumstantial evidence does exist . Firstly , localization of chitosan with anti - chitosan antibodies and the chitosan - speci(cid:12)c dye eosin Y revealed that multiple species of plant pathogen , including Puccinia graminis and M . oryzae convert exposed chitin on the surface of appressoria and invasive hyphae , to chitosan ( Gueddari et al . , 2002 ; Fujikawa et al . , 2009 ) . Secondly , transgenic rice plants expressing chitosanase demonstrated a modest increase in resistance to M . oryzae infec - tion ( Kouzai et al . , 2012 ) . However , chitosan is not the only cell wall component that is thought to act as a stealth mechanism . As discussed previously , a 1 , 3 - glucan has also been shown to play a similar role . Crucially , this is supported by ample experimental evidence showing that loss of a 1 , 3 - glucan alone is su(cid:14)cient to prevent successful infection in a number of species , including M . oryzae . This raises an important question . Pre - sumably , synthesis of chitosan was una(cid:11)ected by the loss of a 1 , 3 - glucan , although this was not determined . If this is the case , it suggests that chitosan alone is insu(cid:14)cient to provide protection , and it is a 1 , 3 - glucan that acts as the primary defence mechanism in these fungi . Alternatively , the primary role of chitosan in pathogenic fungi may not be as a protective / stealth mechanism at all . As discussed above , chitin deacetylation could theoretically have important developmental consequences because of its unique physical and chemical attributes . Investigating chitin deacetylation in phytopathogenic fungi will allow us to resolve these questions , and to determine whether chitosan plays a devel - opmental role , a protective role , or both . A small amount of previous work suggests that the former may be true in M . oryzae : deletion of a putative chitin deacetylase called Cbp1 resulted in defective appressorium formation on arti(cid:12)cial surfaces , suggesting chitin deacetylation may be required for appressorium development ( Kamakura et al . , 2002 ) . During infection of root tissues , M . oryzae forms a structure known as a hyphopodium , rather than an appressorium ( Sesma and Osbourn , 2004 ) . Intriguingly , deletion of Cbp1 37 also prevented hyphopodium and pre - invasive hypha formation on arti(cid:12)cial surfaces ( but not root surfaces ) , indicating that chitosan could play a role in multiple infection - related cellular di(cid:11)erentiation events ( Tucker et al . , 2010 ) . However , chitosan synthesis was not reduced in the cbp1 mutant and neither was the chitin deacetylase activity of Cbp1 proven , so the results remain inconclusive . Nevertheless , this work provides a platform from which further work on characterizing the role of chitin deacetylation in M . oryzae can be undertaken . Importantly , if chitin deacetylases do prove to be critical for development or pathogenicity , they would represent a novel and valuable fungicide target . Cell wall - associated proteins Although the fungal cell wall is largely composed of polysaccharides , proteins also make up a signi(cid:12)cant minority by mass , estimated to be (cid:24) 10 % although this varies consider - ably depending on growth conditions , the species in question and methodology ( Nguyen et al . , 1998 ; Bowman and Free , 2006 ) . Cell wall proteins can be divided into 3 broad cate - gories : Those with de(cid:12)ned enzymatic activities ( as described above , and many others be - sides ) , those with putative structural roles , and those that have roles in cell - environment interactions . Whatever their role , most proteins residing within the cell wall are N - and / or O - glycosylated , although the precise nature of the linked oligosaccharides varies between species . In S . cerevisiae and C . albicans these chains are rich in mannose residues , whereas in N . crassa and A . fumigatus they are composed of galactomannan ( a mixture of both galactose and mannose residues ) . In either case , synthesis of these oligosaccha - ride moieties occurs in the secretory pathway , prior to presentation of the protein at the cell wall . In S . cerevisiae , a series of ER and golgi - localized mannosyltransferases catalyse the synthesis of a 1 , 6 - linked mannose chains , which are decorated with branches of a 1 , 2 - mannose and a 1 , 3 - mannose . In N . crassa and Aspergillus spp . , a similar set of mannose chains exists , except these are terminated oligosaccharides of b 1 , 5 - linked galac - tose residues ( Bardalaye and Nordin , 1977 ; Nakajima et al . , 1982 ) . Many of these cell wall glycoproteins are covalently linked to cell wall b 1 , 3 - glucan by their polysaccharide side - chains ( Koll(cid:19)ar et al . , 1997 ) . In other cases , it is the GPI - anchor of a cell wall pro - tein that is covalently linked to b 1 , 6 - glucan , a reaction which occurs via an unknown transglycosylation mechanism ( Kapteyn et al . , 1996 ; Koll(cid:19)ar et al . , 1997 ) . These covalent 38 linkages provide stable and long - term attachment of proteins to the cell wall , which may particularly important for those where presentation at the cell surface is critical for their function ( e . g . adhesins ) . Investigations employing di(cid:11)erent extraction techniques have resulted in the identi(cid:12) - cation of numerous cell wall - associated proteins which do not have identi(cid:12)able enzymatic activities or protein domains ( De Groot et al . , 2005 ) . These proteins could perhaps be considered as ‘structural’ proteins , although many are hesitant to use such a term , as these proteins may simply catalyse reactions that have yet to be characterized . One such family of putative structural proteins has been characterized in S . cerevisiae . The Pir ( = Protein with Internal Repeats ) family comprises 4 structurally related proteins , which are serine / threonine - rich , have a characteristic N - terminal repeat sequence and are thought to be highly O - glycosylated ( Mr(cid:20)sa and Tanner , 1999 ) . These proteins were also found to be covalently - linked to the cell wall through a novel glutamate - glucose linkage , postulated to occur via a novel transglutaminase - type reaction ( Ecker et al . , 2006 ) . PIR deletion strains exhibited slight growth and morphological defects and increased sensi - tivity to Congo Red and Calco(cid:13)uor White , suggesting some role in cell wall integrity , although the precise physiological role of these proteins remains unknown ( Mr(cid:20)sa and Tanner , 1999 ) . Numerous other proteins with putative structural roles have also been identi(cid:12)ed in S . cerevisiae , including Ccw12 , a small mannoprotein which when deleted , also result in signi(cid:12)cant growth and cell wall defects ( Ragni et al . , 2007b ) . Many of these structural proteins identi(cid:12)ed in S . cerevisiae and closely related species do not have ho - mologues in (cid:12)lamentous fungi , however . In fact , few cell wall proteins of this type have been characterized in (cid:12)lamentous species . One exception is the putative GPI - anchored protein EMP1 in M . oryzae , which has homologues in other species including Fusarium oxysporum ( FEM1 ) ( Ahn et al . , 2004 ; Cornelissen and Haring , 2001 ) . EMP1 is highly expressed during appressorium development , and deletion of this gene resulted in reduced appressorium formation and pathogenicity , although the reason for this phenotype was not deduced . In A . fumigatus , a repeat - rich GPI - anchored cell wall protein , CspA , was identi(cid:12)ed and characterized . Deletion of CspA resulted in a disorganized and weakened cell wall , and reduced adhesion to extracellular matrix , suggesting a role in maintaining cell wall integrity ( Levdansky et al . , 2010 ) . In conclusion , the role of so - called structural 39 proteins in the fungal cell wall remains elusive . The cross - linking of these proteins to cell wall polysaccharides may act to stabilize the glucan matrix of the wall . Alternatively , the presence of such proteins may be required for the organization of the cell wall , by directing the assembly of nascent polysaccharide chains into the correct con(cid:12)guration . These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive , but the study of these proteins is compli - cated by the fact that their deletion only results in a de(cid:12)nable phenotype in a minority of cases , which may suggest a degree of functional redundancy between these proteins . However , it is also the likely that previous studies simply have not performed the correct experiments or applied su(cid:14)ciently sensitive techniques to determine the true function of these proteins . Proteins involved in cell - environment interactions perfectly illustrate the capacity of the cell wall to act as an interface between the fungal cell and its immediate environ - ment . One class of protein that is well known to have roles in these interactions is the hydrophobins . Hydrophobins are a type of small , cysteine - rich amphipathic protein which self - assemble into monolayers at hydrophilic - hydrophobic interfaces . They can be divided into two classes : class I hydrophobins , which form distinctive , insoluble rodlet assemblies , and class II hydrophobins , which do not form rodlets , and have distinct hydrophobicity pro(cid:12)les ( Sunde et al . , 2008 ) . By assembling on the surface of the cell wall , hydrophobins of both classes are able to confer hydrophobicity to the cells in question . This hydropho - bicity can be crucial for numerous processes over the life - cycle of a fungus . For example , hydrophobin rodlet layers are commonly found on the surface of conidia , where they in - hibit wetting and facilitate dispersal in the air ( Stringer et al . , 1991 ; Bell - Pedersen et al . , 1992 ) . Hydrophobins are also required for the formation of aerial hyphae in many species of fungi ( van Wetter et al . , 1996 ) . In this case however , the hydrophobins are not attached to the wall of the fungal cell , but accumulate at the water - air interface , thereby reducing surface tension and allowing the hyphae to escape the liquid phase ( W(cid:127)osten et al . , 1999 ) . As well as modulating interactions with water , hydrophobins can also mediate interac - tions with hydrophobic surfaces . The best example of this is in M . oryzae , where the class I hydrophobin Mpg1 is required for hydrophobic surface sensing , as discussed previously in Section 1 . 1 . 2 ( Talbot et al . , 1996 ) . In Schizophyllum commune , the hydrophobin Sc3 was also shown to mediate attachment of hyphae to Te(cid:13)on , by accumulating between the cell 40 wall and the hydrophobic surface ( W(cid:127)osten et al . , 1994 ) . Apart from physical interactions , it is also apparent in some cases that hydrophobins are required for successful interaction between a pathogenic fungus and its host . In A . fumigatus , the hydrophobin RodA forms rodlet layers on the surface of conidia . Removal of this layer resulted in activation of a Dectin1 - mediated host response and prevention of infection , suggesting that in this case , the hydrophobins were acting to mask immunostimulatory cell wall components , much like a 1 , 3 - glucan , as discussed previously ( Aimanianda et al . , 2009 ; de Jesus Carrion et al . , 2013 ) . The second major class of proteins with well - characterized roles in cell - environment interactions is the adhesins . These are a class of highly - glycosylated , cell wall associated proteins which promote cellular adhesion , either to other cells , or to abiotic surfaces . Attached to the cell wall by a C - terminal GPI - anchor , the N - terminus of adhesins is able to protrude into the immediate vicinity of the fungal cell , and mediate interactions often via a sugar or amino acid binding domain ( Verstrepen and Klis , 2006 ) . These interactions serve several purposes during fungal growth . In S . cerevisiae , a family of the mannose - binding adhesins including Flo1 mediate cell - cell interactions , thereby causing (cid:13)occulation ( i . e . aggregation ) of yeast cells ( Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ) . Such interactions are also important for mating in this fungus , although in this case , cellular adhesion is mediated by Aga1 and Aga2 , which together form a - agglutinin and are required to bind the protein Sag1 on the surface of cells of the opposite mating type ( Lipke et al . , 1989 ) . In pathogenic fungi , adhesins are also important for interactions with host cells . In C . albicans , the critical (cid:12)rst step in pathogenesis is the adhesion of the fungal cells to the host surface . This adhesion has been found to be mediated by adhesins of the Als family , which bind to a range of extracellular matrix components , including collagen , (cid:12)bronectin and laminin ( de Groot et al . , 2013 ) . Lastly , adhesins are also able to cause cellular adhesion to abiotic surfaces such as glass or plastic . This is of particular medical relevance , since it is a signi(cid:12)cant factor in fungal infections associated with implanted medical devices ( e . g . catheters ) . In C . albicans , the cause of many such infections , surface hydrophobicity associated with upregulation of the Als family of adhesins is responsible ( Beaussart et al . , 2012 ) . Little is known of the presence or function of adhesins in fungi outside of the Saccharomycotina subphylum , in contrast to the wealth of knowledge brie(cid:13)y 41 outlined above . In the insect pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae , the adhesins Mad1 and Mad2 were required for conidial adhesion to insect cuticle and plant surfaces respectively . Unexpectedly , deletion of MAD1 also caused multiple morphogenic defects , which may suggest that conidial adhesion itself could be a signal for normal development ( Wang and St Leger , 2007 ) . As of yet , no adhesins have been characterized in phytopathogenic species , although it is quite possible that the spore - tip mucilage necessary for conidial adhesion in M . oryzae may contain adhesin - like proteins . Wall - associated proteins clearly have diverse and crucial roles in fungal lifestyles , which in turn serves to illustrate the multifaceted role of the cell wall . These proteins can have roles in cellular integrity , morphogenesis and interactions . The composition of the cell wall is central to the correct functioning of these proteins . This is particularly apparent for the adhesins , which are covalently linked to glucan moieties via their GPI - anchor , and the association of hydrophobins with the cell wall may also be in(cid:13)uenced by wall composition . Further work is required in order to determine the possible roles of wall - associated proteins in phytopathogenic fungi such as M . oryzae . Of particular interest are proteins which may occur on the surface of invasive hyphae and determine interactions with the plant cell , or those on germ tubes and conidia that interact with the plant surface . Melanin synthesis Melanins are a family of molecule that form a complex , darkly pigmented polymer of unknown molecular structure . In fungi , two main forms of melanin exist , classi(cid:12)ed depending on the constituent molecule : DHN - melanin is synthesized from monomers of 1 , 8 Dihydroxynapthalene ( DHN ) , whereas DOPA - melanin is synthesized from 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine ( DOPA ) . DHN - melanin is a common form of melanin found in many species of fungi , including M . oryzae . The precursor molecule for the synthesis of DHN - melanin is either acetyl - CoA or malonyl - CoA , which are joined together by a polyketide synthase ( PKS ) enzyme into 1 , 3 , 6 , 8 - tetrahydroxynapthalene ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 8 - THN ) . This is then reduced and dehydrated in a number of steps , forming 1 , 8 - dihydroxynapthalene ( DHN ) , which is polymerized to form melanin . DOPA - melanin is only found in a limited number of fungi , including the 42 mammalian pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans . In this case , the precursor molecule is ei - ther L - DOPA or tyrosine , which are converted in a number of steps into dihydroxyindoles , which polymerize to form the melanin ( Eisenman and Casadevall , 2012 ) . All of the above synthesis steps occur intracellularly , although the precise location is unclear . It has been hypothesized that melanin biosynthesis and subsequent tra(cid:14)cking to the cell wall occurs in vesicles named melanosomes , although no conclusive evidence has yet been presented . Once deposited in the cell wall , the melanin is observed in di(cid:11)erent con(cid:12)gurations depend - ing on the species in question . In C . neoformans , which forms DOPA - melanin , discrete granules 40 - 130 nm in diameter are found in concentric layers in the cell wall ( Eisenman et al . , 2005 ) . A recent study also revealed that this melanin was covalently linked to the polysaccharides of the cell wall ( Chatterjee et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , in the appressoria of M . oryzae , the melanin is observed as a discrete layer in the inner part of the cell wall ( Wang et al . , 2007 ) . Melanins have numerous roles in the life cycle of many fungi . As a structural com - ponent of the cell wall , it is important in imparting strength and rigidity . It is also highly impermeable , capable of acting as a di(cid:11)usion barrier . These properties mean that melanin is a crucial component of the appressorium cell wall in M . oryzae ( as discussed in Section 1 . 1 . 2 ) , as well as in other species of appressorium - forming fungi ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Gachomo et al . , 2010 ) . Melanins are also known to be virulence factors in a num - ber of mammalian pathogens . For example in C . neoformans and Penicillium marne(cid:11)ei , strains unable to melanize were less virulent in mice ( Salas et al . , 1996 ; Woo et al . , 2010 ) , and in a Cryptococcus gattii outbreak , higher expression of genes involved in melaniza - tion was associated with greater virulence ( Ngamskulrungroj et al . , 2011 ) . The likely reason for the association between melanin and virulence in these fungi is that , as an impermeable layer in the cell wall , melanin can provide protection against a broad range of chemical factors , including lytic enzymes , oxidising agents and detergents . There is also evidence that melanin can provide protection against fungicides : melanized strains of C . neoformans and H . capsulatum were less susceptible to amphotericin B and caspo - fungin , due to binding of the drugs to the melanin ( van Duin et al . , 2002 ) . Similarly , unmelanized strains of the pathogen Wangiella dermatitidis were also shown to be less resistant to vorinconazole and amphotericin B ( Paolo et al . , 2006 ) . Melanin also appears 43 to have roles beyond just being a simple physical barrier . In an intriguing study , melanin in the cell wall of the phagocytosed conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus was shown to be necessary to prevent apoptosis of the macrophage , suggesting that the melanin functions to manipulate host - cell signalling ( Volling et al . , 2011 ) . Taken together , it is clear that melanin is a key virulence factor that can contribute to fungal survival and pathogenicity in a number of ways . A number of fungicides already target melanin biosynthesis , including the inhibitors of DHN - melanin biosynthesis tricyclazole and carpromatid , as discussed in Section 1 . 1 . 2 . However , there are no fungicides targeting DOPA - melanin biosynthesis . Although melanin is not an absolute requirement for virulence in those fungi which produce DOPA - melanin ( e . g . C . neoformans , H . capsulatum ) , it is known to hinder treatment with fungicides , as mentioned above . Therefore , inhibition of melanin biosynthesis in these fungi could be considered as a way to improve e(cid:14)cacy of current anti - fungal treatments . 44 1 . 3 Summary (cid:15) Magnaporthe oryzae is a destructive pathogen and a model organism for the study of phytopathogenic fungi . (cid:15) The fungal cell wall has roles in maintaining cellular integrity , controlling cellular morphogenesis and in(cid:13)uences the interactions of fungi with their environment and other organisms . (cid:15) The cell wall is a valuable target for fungicides , although exploitation of this target is hindered by a lack of understanding of the processes involved in cell wall synthesis and remodelling . (cid:15) The interactions of a pathogenic fungus with its host usually involves infection - speci(cid:12)c changes in cell wall structure and composition in order to remain undetected or to protect itself from host defence responses . (cid:15) One such observed change is the deacetylation of chitin to form chitosan . Chitin deacetylation could both protect the cell wall from digestion by plant chitinases , and reduce the exposure of PAMPs . (cid:15) Chitosan also di(cid:11)ers signi(cid:12)cantly in its chemical and physical properties compared with chitin , so chitin deacetylation could also be required for morphogenesis . (cid:15) Magnaporthe oryzae is an ideal organism in which to test the hypotheses regarding the roles of chitin deacetylation - it is genetically tractable , and a small amount of previous work suggests an intriguing role for chitin deacetylation during appresso - rium development . 45 1 . 4 Aims and Objectives The overall aim of this study is to test the key hypotheses regarding chitin deacetylation in fungi , namely its putative roles as either a ’stealth mechanism’ or as a critical determinant of cell wall (cid:13)exibility during cellular morphogenesis . This will be achieved by : (cid:15) Characterizing the role of chitin deacetylation during appressorium development . Deletion strains for chitin deacetylases operating during this process will be created and analysed for their ability to develop appressoria . (cid:15) Characterizing the role of chitin deacetylation during vegetative growth . Deletion strains for chitin deacetylases operating during this process will be created and vegetative growth and development evaluated . An additional aim of the study is to investigate whether the hydrolysis of chitosan is also required for cell wall remodelling during morphogenesis . This will be achieved by creating a deletion strain for the sole gene encoding a putative chitosanase in M . oryzae . 46 Chapter 2 Materials and Methods 47 In the following chapter , the complete Materials and Methods employed in this thesis are detailed . Unless otherwise stated , all reagents were acquired from Sigma - Aldrich ( St Louis , Missouri ) . 2 . 0 . 1 Media and Solutions Appendix A details the recipes of the media used for the culture of all organisms used in this thesis . Appendix B details the solutions used for protocols in this thesis . 2 . 0 . 2 Culturing Magnaporthe oryzae Routine culturing of Magnaporthe oryzae was carried out on solid or in liquid medium , depending upon experimental requirements . In all cases , procedures involving the ma - nipulation of fungal material were carried out in a Gelaire BSB4 Class II biological safety cabinet , in accordance with Animal and Plant Health Agency ( APHA ) licensing . A table of the media used is shown in Appendix A . All strains used in this study are listed in Appendix F and in Figure 2 . 1 . Growth on solid media For routine growth , 100 mm circular Petri dishes ( ThermoFisher Scienti(cid:12)c ) (cid:12)lled with 25 - 30 ml complete medium ( CM ) , were inoculated with (cid:12)lter papers containing dessicated conidia and mycelium of Magnaporthe oryzae ( See ‘long - term storage of M . oryzae ’ ) . The plates were then sealed with Micropore tape ( 3M ) and incubated in a Panasonic MLR - 350 or a Panasonic MLR - 352H - PE incubator at 24 o C for 10 - 14 days ( with a light / dark cycle of 14 hr light / 10 hr dark , to induce conidiation ) . For evaluating growth of a deletion strain on solid media , a protocol was employed that yielded reliable and reproducible results . Circular petri dishes ( 100mm diameter ) were (cid:12)lled with exactly 30 ml of medium . A 5 mm plug of mycelium from the growing edge of a 10 - 11 day old plate of M . oryzae growing on CM was inoculated onto the centre of the Figure 2 . 1 ( following page ) : Table of M . oryzae strains used in this study . All strains , with the exception of Guy11 and Ku70 ( Villalba et al . , 2008 ) , were constructed during this study . The table details the genotypes of the strains , the background strain used for their construction , and antibiotic resistance markers present . The transformant line N o column details which of the successful transformants were used for experimentation . 48 49 plate . Plates were then sealed with Micropore tape and incubated for 10 days at 24 o C . In some cases ( plates with CFW or CR ) , incubation in the dark was required , in which case the plates were wrapped in aluminium foil . Colony diameters were measured twice for each plate ( at perpendicular angles ) . Appendix C details the treatments used in plate growth assays . Growth in liquid media Growth in liquid medium was necessary to provide fungal material for a number of down - stream experiments ( for example , transformation or cell wall analysis ) . First , conidia were harvested from 10 - 14 day old plates by pipetting of 5ml sterile MilliQ water onto the fungal colony , followed by gentle scraping of the colony with a sterile scalpel , and (cid:12)ltering of the resulting suspension through two layers of sterile Miracloth ( Merck Milli - pore ) , to isolate the conidia . The conidia were centrifuged at 2850g in a Beckman - Coulter Allegra X - 15R for 5 min , the supernatant discarded , and the conidia resuspended in 1 ml sterile dH 2 O . The concentration of conidia was determined by counting on a haemo - cytometer , and adjusted as required . Typically , conical (cid:13)asks containing 300 ml of liquid CM ( or less , depending on experimental requirements ) were then inoculated with the conidial suspension . Penicillin and streptomycin ( 50 m g / ml each , (cid:12)nal concentration ) were added to prevent bacterial growth , and the (cid:13)asks sealed with a foil cap . Incubation was performed in a New Brunswick Scienti(cid:12)c innova 4230 Refrigerated Incubator Shaker at 24 o C with shaking at 150 rpm in the dark . Incubation period depended on experimen - tal requirements . For evaluating growth of deletion strains in liquid media , 100 ml conical (cid:13)asks ( VWR ) containing 50 ml of medium were inoculated with precisely 5 x 10 4 conidia ( from a stock suspension of 5 x 10 5 conidia / ml , harvested as above ) . Penicillin and streptomycin were added , and the (cid:13)asks were sealed and incubated as discussed above . After the incubation period , (cid:13)asks were removed and their contents (cid:12)ltered under vacuum through pre - weighed Whatman GF / A 47 mm glass micro(cid:12)bre (cid:12)lters . The (cid:12)lters containing the fungal material were then dried overnight at 80 o C , and re - weighed to determine the biomass . For growth assays employing stress treatments , for example as shown in Figure 4 . 7 , treatments were added at 48 hpi and biomass harvested at 120 - 144 hpi . Appendix C details the treatments 50 used in liquid growth assays . Long - term storage of M . oryzae In order to make a stock for long - term storage , a 100 mm petri dish containing 25 - 30 ml CM was (cid:12)rst inoculated with the strain of interest . Small ( approx . 5 mm x 5 mm ) squares of sterile Whatman (cid:12)lter paper were then placed on the plate , such that the original inoculum was surrounded by (cid:24) 50 squares of paper . The plate was sealed , and incubated as discussed previously . Once su(cid:14)cient growth had occurred to cover the (cid:12)lter papers , they were removed with sterile forceps , and placed into 50 mm petri dishes , which were then sealed with Micropore tape . These were dessicated thoroughly by placing them in an airtight container with silica gel , for 1 - 2 weeks . Once dry , the (cid:12)lter papers could either be stored in a cool , dry place ( for medium - term storage ) or at - 20 o C ( for long - term storage ) . 2 . 0 . 3 DNA extraction Two di(cid:11)erent DNA extraction protocols were performed , depending on the downstream applications . A more laborious method resulted in high quality gDNA , but this was impractical for processing of large numbers of samples , for example during screening of transformants . In this case , a second protocol was used that resulted in very low quality DNA that was nevertheless su(cid:14)cient for subsequent diagnostic protocols . For high - quality gDNA For the isolation of high quality gDNA , fungal tissue ( 100 - 200 mg ) was (cid:12)rst collected by scraping of 10 - 14 day old M . oryzae colonies with a sterile scalpel . Tissue could be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 o C if required . Frozen tissue was thoroughly ground in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar , and DNA was isolated using a Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini kit , according to manufacturers instructions . Quality and quantity of the resulting DNA was analysed by gel electrophoresis and by spectrophotometry . 51 For screening of transformants For the screening of large numbers of transformants , the following protocol was employed that allowed rapid isolation of low quality gDNA from large numbers of samples . A small amount ( (cid:24) 100 mg wet weight ) of fungal tissue was (cid:12)rst collected by scraping of a portion of a fungal colony growing on a selection plate ( as detailed in 2 . 0 . 7 ) . In a 1 . 5 ml Eppendorf tube , the tissue was ground in the presence of 400 m l DNA extraction bu(cid:11)er , using a sterile plastic micropestle , and then left at room temperature for 30 - 60 min for extraction to occur . The tubes were then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 16 , 000 g for 5 min , and the supernatant ( 300 m l ) transferred to a new tube . To the supernatant , 300 m l of isopropanol was added , mixed , and incubated at room temperature for 2 min . Samples were centrifuged again at 16 , 000 g for 5 min , and the resulting pellet dried at room temperate for 30 - 60 min . The dried pellet was then resuspended in 50 m l TE bu(cid:11)er ( pH 7 . 5 ) . 2 . 0 . 4 RNA extraction and gDNA removal In order to isolate high - quality , undegraded RNA it is crucial to maintain an RNAse free environment in which to perform RNA extraction . In order to provide such an environment , bench areas and equipment were cleaned using RNaseZap ( ThermoFisher Scienti(cid:12)c ) before use . Pipette tips and tubes used were either certi(cid:12)ed RNase free , or were treated with DEPC before use . Fungal tissues to be used for RNA extraction were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvesting and stored at - 80 o C if necessary . Material was (cid:12)rst ground thoroughly in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar , then RNA extraction was performed us - ing the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit , according to manufacturers instructions . Before the isolated RNA could used for downstream procedures , contaminating gDNA was re - moved . This was achieved by using an Ambion Turbo DNA - free TM Kit , according to manufacturers instructions . Quality and quantity of the isolated RNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry . If necessary , concentration could be increased by performing RNA precipitation , as follows : To a starting volume of 200 m l of RNA , 20 m l of 3M sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 3 ) , 1 m l of GlycoBlue and 220 m l isopropanol were added . This mixture was kept at - 20 o C overnight , then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge 52 at 16 , 000 g at 4 o C for 60 min . The supernatant was removed , and the pellet washed with 1 ml ice - cold 70 % ethanol . Samples were spun at 16 , 000 g at 4 o C for 20 min and the supernatant removed . The pellet was then allowed to dry at room temperate , and was resuspended in 10 - 20 m l of nuclease - free water . 2 . 0 . 5 cDNA synthesis Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was performed by using the Maxima First Strand cDNA synthesis kit ( ThermoFisher Scienti(cid:12)c ) , according to manufacturers in - structions . Reactions both without the reverse transcriptase ( - RT control ) and without template RNA ( No Transcript Control ( NTC ) ) were included , in order to control for the presence of contaminating gDNA in subsequent PCR reactions ( see 2 . 0 . 6 ) . Synthesized cDNA was aliquoted into separate tubes ( to reduce freeze - thaw cycles ) and stored at - 80 o C . 2 . 0 . 6 PCR PCR was employed for the ampli(cid:12)cation of target DNA sequences . Three di(cid:11)erent proto - cols were used , depending on whether the DNA ampli(cid:12)cation was for diagnostic purposes , for the construction of cloning fragments and gene deletion cassettes or for the quanti(cid:12) - cation of transcript levels . Ampli(cid:12)cation of cloning fragments and construction of gene deletion cassettes The ampli(cid:12)cation of DNA sequences without the introduction of errors is crucial for suc - cessful cloning and construction of gene deletion cassettes . With this in mind , a protocol was followed that employed a high - (cid:12)delity DNA polymerase ( Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase ( Agilent ) ) . For the ampli(cid:12)cation of cloning fragments , high quality genomic DNA was used as a template ( detailed in 2 . 0 . 3 ) . A 50 m l reaction comprised the following reagents , added in this order : 36 m l dH 2 O , 10 m l Herculase reaction bu(cid:11)er , 1 m l dNTPs ( 25 mM each ) , 1 m l DNA template ( typically 100 - 300 ng gDNA ) , 1 . 25 m l of each primer ( from 10 m M stock ) and 1 m l of Herculase II DNA Polymerase . The reaction mixture was placed in a BioRad PTC - 100 thermocycler , and the following 53 programme run : Step 1 : 95 o C for 4 min Step 2 : 95 o C for 20 sec Step 3 : 57 - 63 o C for 30 sec ( depending on primer annealing temperature ) Step 4 : 72 o C for 1 - 3 min ( depending on target length ) Step 5 : 72 o C for 10 min Steps 2 - 4 were repeated 34 times . Upon completion of the programme , ampli(cid:12)ed DNA was used in downstream cloning reactions ( discussed in 2 . 0 . 9 ) , or for the creation of deletion cassettes , as discussed below . In all cases , it was necessary to perform a PCR cleanup reaction to remove unincorporated dNTPs , primers , enzyme etc . This was achieved by using a Qiagen PCR puri(cid:12)cation kit according to manufacturers instructions . In the event that a mixture of PCR products was obtained , gel extraction was used to purify the intended product . This was achieved using a Qiagen QiaQuick Gel extraction kit , according to manufacturers instructions . For the creation of gene deletion cassettes , fusion PCR was used to create a linear DNA fragment of 4 - 5 kb in length , by joining together three smaller DNA fragments ( an antibiotic resistance gene , and two 1 - 1 . 5 kb fragments homologous to sequences (cid:13)anking the gene of interest ) . Three di(cid:11)erent antibiotic resistance genes were used in deletion cas - settes , encoding resistance to Hygromycin B ( HPH ) , Bialaphos ( BAR ) or Sulphonylurea ( resistant allele of ALS ) . However , the large size of ALS prohibited successful fusion PCR , and so Yeast gap - repair cloning was used in this case ( see section 2 . 0 . 9 ) . The (cid:12)rst step in fusion PCR involved ampli(cid:12)cation of the three constituent parts by high (cid:12)delity PCR , as described above , with one important di(cid:11)erence : primers were designed such that a 20 - 30 bp complementary overhang existed between the DNA fragments that were to be joined together ( primers used are listed in Appendix E ) . Two products from the (cid:12)rst round of PCR ( usually a (cid:13)anking fragment and the resistance gene ) were then joined in a second polymerase reaction . Finally , a third round of PCR joined the third DNA fragment to the product from the second round PCR . As obtaining a pure product in these reactions was a rare occurrence , it was often necessary to perform a gel extraction , as explained 54 above . Once successfully puri(cid:12)ed , the deletion cassette was used in transformation , as explained in 2 . 0 . 7 . PCR for screening of transformants Diagnostic PCR for the screening of transformant lines usually involved several tens or even hundreds of simultaneous reactions , and so use of high (cid:12)delity PCR here would have been both unnecessary and expensive . Therefore , the high (cid:12)delity DNA polymerase was substituted for recombinant Taq Polymerase ( ThermoFisher Scienti(cid:12)c ) , in the following 50 m l reaction mixture : 36 m l dH 2 O , 5 m l reaction bu(cid:11)er ( as supplied ) , 5 m l MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 m l dNTPs ( 10 mM each ) , 1 m l DNA template , 1 m l of each primer ( from 10 m M stock ) and 0 . 5 m l Taq DNA Polymerase . Typically , three di(cid:11)erent reactions were run for each transformant : One to test for the presence of the gene of interest ( negative in successful deletions ) and two reactions testing for integration of the resistance gene at the correct locus . Reactions were run as described in the previous subsection , and 20 m l loaded onto a 1 % Agarose gel ( with 0 . 1 m g / ml Ethidium Bromide ) for visualization . RT - PCR Semi - quantitative RT - PCR as employed in this thesis required a cDNA template synthe - sized from RNA isolated from a sample of interest ( e . g . germlings ) . RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis are outlined in 2 . 0 . 4 and 2 . 0 . 5 . A 25 m l reaction comprised the following : 17 . 25 m l dH 2 O , 2 . 5 m l reaction bu(cid:11)er ( as supplied ) , 2 . 5 m l MgCl 2 , 0 . 25 m l dNTPs ( 10 mM each ) , 0 . 5 m l of each primer ( from 10 m M stock ) , 0 . 5 m l Taq DNA Polymerase ( Ther - moFisher Scienti(cid:12)c ) and 1 m l cDNA template . Reactions were run on a BioRad PTC - 100 thermocycler essentially as described above , except that the extension time was shortened to 1 min ( due to small product lengths ) , and the cycle number was varied between 20 - 35 depending on transcript abundance . In all experiments , both - RT and NTC controls were included , to control for the possibility of gDNA contamination in the cDNA ( see 2 . 0 . 5 ) . 20 m l of each reaction was loaded onto a 2 - 3 % agarose gel ( with ethidium bromide ) for visualization . 55 2 . 0 . 7 DNA - mediated transformation of Magnaporthe oryzae Transformation was used to introduce foreign DNA constructs into protoplasts of M . oryzae . These constructs included gene deletion cassettes ( as discussed in 2 . 0 . 6 ) , or plasmids con - taining (cid:13)uorescent gene fusions ( as described in 2 . 0 . 9 ) . All solutions and media used in this protocol are detailed in Appendix B and Appendix A respectively . The (cid:12)rst step in the transformation process was growth of the background strain in liq - uid culture ( as described in 2 . 0 . 2 ) , to provide material for the generation of protoplasts . Usually , conidia from one 10 day old colony growing on solid CM were inoculated into 300 ml of liquid CM , and incubated as described previously ( 2 . 0 . 2 ) , for 72 hr . The resulting mycelium was harvested by (cid:12)ltering the culture through two layers of sterile miracloth , and excess medium removed by drying on sterile paper towels . The dried mycelium was then divided into two separate 50 ml falcon tubes each containing 50 ml OM bu(cid:11)er , and cut into smaller fragments with a sterile scalpel . Tubes were sealed with Para(cid:12)lm ( Be - mis ) , and incubated in darkness at 30 o C , with shaking at 150 rpm , for 3 - 4 hr . Digested mycelium ( containing the protoplasts ) was then divided into 4 falcon tubes ( 25 ml in each ) , and gently overlayed with 25 ml cold ST bu(cid:11)er , such that a distinct boundary was visible between the bu(cid:11)er and the digested mycelium . The tubes were centrifuged at 2850g in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X - 15R with a SX4750 rotor , for 15 min at 4 o C . Protoplasts accumulated at the interface between the ST bu(cid:11)er and digestate , and were harvested with a sterile plastic pipette , and placed in a new 50 ml Falcon tube . The protoplasts were overlayed with 10 ml cold STC bu(cid:11)er , and centrifuged at 2000g for 10 min at 4 o C . The supernatant was removed , and the protoplasts resuspended in 10 ml STC bu(cid:11)er . At this point , protoplasts from the separate tubes could be combined if desired . The centrifugation and resuspension steps were then repeated more three times , except that in the (cid:12)nal step protoplasts were resuspended in 150 m l of STC bu(cid:11)er . The protoplast concentration was determined by counting on a haemocytometer , and adjusted to 2 - 5 x 10 8 protoplasts / ml . For transformation , 140 m l of protoplasts were combined with 10 m l of DNA ( containing 5 - 15 m g of DNA , depending on the size of the construct ) in a 1 . 5 ml Eppendorf tube and incubated at room temperature for 20 min . To the DNA and protoplasts , 1 ml of PTC bu(cid:11)er was added , mixed by inverting the tube , then incubated for a further 15 min at 56 room temperature . Finally , the protoplast / DNA / PTC bu(cid:11)er mixture was pipetted into molten OCM or BDCM agar ( depending on selection requirements ) , and mixed before being poured into Petri dishes ( 15 - 20 mls per plate ) . The plates were allowed to set , and were then wrapped in aluminium foil and incubated at room temperature for 16 - 24 hr , before being overlayed with selection media ( (cid:24) 35 mls per plate ) . The nature of the overlay depended on the antibiotic being used for selection ; these are outlined in Appendix A . Hygromycin B ( Merck Millipore , Cat . No . 400051 ) was used at a (cid:12)nal concentration of 300 m g / ml , Bialaphos ( Gold Biotechnology ) was used at a (cid:12)nal concentration of 60 m g / ml , and chlorimuron ethyl ( sulphonylurea - a generous gift from the Talbot laboratory , Exeter University ) at a (cid:12)nal concentration of 100 m g / ml . Once overlayed , the plates were wrapped in aluminium foil again , and incubated at 24 o C for 7 - 14 days . Transformants usually appeared from 7 days onwards , and could be selected from the original transformation plates and inoculated onto 50 mm Petri dishes containing the ap - propriate medium for the second round of selection . Antibiotic concentration was reduced at this stage of selection : Hygromycin and Bialaphos were both used at 1 / 3 the original concentration , and chlorimuron ethyl at 1 / 5 the original concentration . Selection plates were once again incubated at 24 o C , for 7 - 14 days , after which su(cid:14)cient growth should have occurred to allow for DNA extraction from the surviving colonies ( as described in 2 . 0 . 3 ) . 2 . 0 . 8 Southern blot analysis Southern blotting was used to con(cid:12)rm the number and location of inserted antibiotic resistance genes in putative gene deletion strains . High - quality gDNA ( 5 - 10 m g , isolated as described in 2 . 0 . 3 ) , was (cid:12)rst digested overnight ( in a 50 m l reaction ) by restriction enzymes ( New England Biosciences ) . The particular enzymes used were chosen such that the resulting fragment that contained the antibiotic resistance gene in question would be 4 - 7 kb in length . An additional requirement was that the restriction enzymes did not cut twice within the deletion cassette used in the transformation . This ensured that both the location and number of insertions could be determined from the digest . Once digested , the DNA was mixed with loading dye loaded onto a 0 . 8 % agarose gel ( without ethidium bromide ) , together with DNA ladder ( either GeneRuler 1 kb Plus or GeneRuler 1 kb , 57 mixed with ethidium bromide ( ThermoFisher Scienti(cid:12)c ) ) . The gel was run overnight in TAE bu(cid:11)er at 20 - 30V ( 1 . 5 - 2 V / cm ) , until the DNA had run the full length of the gel , thus ensuring good band separation . The gel was then imaged on a Syngene G - box alongside a ruler , in order to make note of the physical position of the DNA ladder band sizes on the gel before blotting . To ensure e(cid:14)cient transfer of the DNA from the gel onto the membrane , the gel was placed in a plastic box and washed by shaking at (cid:24) 50 rpm on an orbital shaker with depurination bu(cid:11)er ( 10 - 20 min ) , denaturation bu(cid:11)er ( 30 - 60 min ) and neutralisation bu(cid:11)er ( 30 - 60 min ) . DNA was transferred from the gel onto a positively charged nylon membrane ( Hybond N + ( Amersham ) ) by the capillary transfer method ( Sambrook and Russell , 2005 ) . Once the DNA had been successfully transferred , it was cross - linked to the membrane by UV treatment ( Stratalinker UV Crosslinker ( Strata - gene ) ) . The membrane could then be used immediately , or dried and stored until ready for hybridisation . Hybridisation of the membranes was performed as follows : Membranes were (cid:12)rst placed in a hybridisation tube , and treated with 7 ml hybridisation bu(cid:11)er ( Perfect Hyb - Plus Hybridisation bu(cid:11)er ) , by rotating at 65 o C in a Hybaid Shake ‘n’ stack ( ThermoFisher Scienti(cid:12)c ) for 20 - 60 min . Membranes were hybridised with 32 P labelled DNA , synthe - sized by the Invitrogen Random Primer labelling kit , as per manufacturers instructions : (cid:24) 25ng of template DNA was ampli(cid:12)ed in the presence of 32 P labelled dCTP ( 50 m Ci ) . The radiolabelled DNA was puri(cid:12)ed from unincorporated nucleotides by mixing with an equal volume of Dextran Blue ( 50 mg / ml ) and separating through an Illustra TM Nick TM Sephadex G - 50 column ( GE ) . The puri(cid:12)ed DNA was denatured by boiling for 10 min , then added to the membrane and left to hybridize overnight . Following hybridisation , the radiolabelled DNA and hybridisation bu(cid:11)er were removed , and the membrane washed as follows : Two 30 min washes with 2x SSC / 0 . 1 % SDS so - lution , one 20 min wash with 1x SSC / 0 . 1 % SDS solution and two 20 min washes with 0 . 1x SSC / 0 . 1 % SDS . All washes were performed at 65 o C in a rotating Hybaid Shake ‘n’ stack , with (cid:24) 50 mls washing solution . After the unhydridised DNA had been removed by washing , the membrane was sealed in a plastic pocket , placed in a lead - shielded cas - sette and exposed to Amersham HyperFilm MP at - 80 o C for 1 - 14 days . Finally , the (cid:12)lm was developed with Kodak autoradiography GBX developer and Kodak autoradiography 58 GBX (cid:12)xer . Successful transformants could be identi(cid:12)ed by the presence of a single band of the expected size ( which depended on the restriction enzymes used ) . 2 . 0 . 9 Cloning Two forms of cloning were used in this thesis . Restriction based cloning in E . coli was used for the construction of (cid:13)uorescent gene fusions and overexpression constructs . Yeast gap - repair cloning was used for making gene deletion cassettes containing ALS , as this gene was too large for successful fusion PCR . Restriction based cloning in E . coli A map of the plasmid ( pUCAP ) used in this type of cloning is shown in Appendix D . The (cid:12)rst step in cloning the DNA sequence of interest was the ampli(cid:12)cation of this se - quence by high - (cid:12)delity PCR , as discussed in 2 . 0 . 6 . However , the design of the primers used was slightly di(cid:11)erent , since restriction sites had to be included in the primer se - quence . A list of the primers used is shown in Appendix E . Following successful DNA ampli(cid:12)cation and puri(cid:12)cation , both the plasmid and insert DNA were digested with com - plementary restriction enzymes ( New England Biosciences ) according to manufacturers instructions . In most cases , Asc I and / or Sbf I were the restriction enzymes used , since these have 8 bp restriction sites and so rarely cut in the insert DNA . The digested plasmid was then dephosphorylated with Calf - Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase ( CiP ) ( New Eng - land Biosciences ) , according to manufacturers instructions , to prevent re - circularization . This was followed by phenol - chloroform extraction ( to remove the enzymes ) and DNA precipitation ( to concentrate the DNA ) , performed as follows : 200 m l DNA as mixed with 200 m l phenol - chloroform , vortexed vigorously and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 16 , 000 g for 2 min . The top layer ( (cid:24) 200 m l , containing the DNA ) was removed , and 6 m l of 5 M NaCl and 618 m l of ethanol were added to precipitate the DNA . After mixing , the tube was place at - 20 o C overnight . The following day , the tube was spun at 16 , 000 g at 4 o C for 60 min , the pellet washed with 70 % ethanol and allowed to dry . Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 10 - 20 m l water and could then be run on an agarose gel to check concentration and purity . DNA ligation was performed in a 10 m l reaction as follows : 1 m l digested vector , 1 - 2 m l 59 digested insert ( depending on concentration ) , 1 m l T4 DNA ligase bu(cid:11)er , 1 m l T4 DNA ligase enzyme ( ThermoFisher Scienti(cid:12)c ) , 5 m l H 2 O . A negative control reaction was also included , which did not include the insert DNA . The reaction mixtures were placed in a 16 o C water bath overnight , for ligation to occur , and then transformed into heat - shock competent E . coli cells ( DH5 a ) as follows : 5 m l of ligation reaction was mixed with 50 m l of cells , and incubated on ice for 20 min . The mixture was then placed in a 42 o C water bath for 2 min , followed by addition of 1 ml Xbroth medium and incubation at 37 o C for 1 hr ( shaking at (cid:24) 200 rpm . ) The transformed cells were then centrifuged at 1100 g in a microcentrifuge for 5 min and resuspended in 200 m l of liquid LB . This cell suspension was spread onto Peri dishes containing solid LB , with Ampicillin ( 100 m g / ml ) as a selectable marker . The plates were sealed with para(cid:12)lm and incubated overnight at 37 o C . After this incubation , colonies were usually visible . Success of the cloning could be judged by comparing the number of colonies from cells transformed with the control vs . experi - mental ligation reactions ; normally very few colonies should be visible on the negative control plate . Colonies were then picked o(cid:11) with a sterile toothpick or pipette - tip , and placed in 5 ml LB ( with 100 m g / ml Ampicillin ) and incubated overnight at 37 o C , shaking at 200 rpm . Finally , the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 4700g in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X - 15R , and the plasmid DNA isolated by using a Qiagen Spin Miniprep Kit , according to manufacturers instructions . Isolated plasmids were screened for the presence of the correct insertion by either PCR or restriction digestion . Con(cid:12)rmed plasmids were in most cases also sent for sequencing ( Source Biosciences ) , to con(cid:12)rm that no changes to the insert had occurred during PCR or cloning . Yeast gap - repair cloning Yeast gap - repair cloning exploits the ability of S . cerevisiae cells to homologously recom - bine linear fragments of DNA with high e(cid:14)ciency , to produce circular plasmids . The (cid:12)rst step in this process was the ampli(cid:12)cation of the target DNA sequences . This was performed in a manner similar to as described previously for the creation of gene - deletion cassettes : Primers ( listed in Appendix E ) were designed such that the ampli(cid:12)ed DNA sequences would have a (cid:24) 30 bp overlap with the DNA fragments or plasmid that they were to recombine with . Once the insert DNA fragments had been successfully ampli - 60 (cid:12)ed , the plasmid ( shown in Appendix D ) was linearized by Hind III digestion and treated with Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( CiP ) ( New England Biosciences ) , to prevent re - circularization . The digested plasmid and the ampli(cid:12)ed DNA fragments were combined with S . cerevisiae cells ( strain D599 ) in an Eppendorf tube as follows : 50 m l salmon sperm DNA ( boiled for 5 min and cooled on ice before use ) , 6 m l ( 200 ng minimum ) linearized vector , 8 m l PCR product ( 300 - 500 ng of each fragment ) and 50 m l S . cerevisiae cells . To this mixture , 32 m l 1 M Lithium acetate and 240 m l 50 % PEG4000 were added , mixed by pipetting and incubated at 30 o C for 30 min . The cells were then subjected to heat shock by incubating at 45 o C for 15 min , then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 380 g for 2 min and resuspended in 200 m l H 2 O . Transformed cells were spread onto Yeast Synthetic drop - out media and incubated at 30 o C for (cid:24) 2 days . From the resulting transformants , 5 - 10 colonies were picked o(cid:11) , inoculated into 50 ml of liquid Yeast drop - out media and incubated at 30 o C , 120 rpm overnight . Following the incubation , cells were pelleted by two centrifugaton steps . First , the 50 ml cultures were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X - 15R , and the pellet resuspended in 500 m l sterile H 2 O . This was then centrifuged at 16 , 000 g in a microcentrifuge for (cid:24) 5 secs , to obtain a pellet of yeast cells . The plasmid DNA was isolated from the yeast cells according to the following protocol : To the pelleted cells , 250 m l of Yeast lysis bu(cid:11)er , 250 m l phenol : chloroform : isoamylalcohol ( 25 : 24 : 1 ) and 300 mg acid washed glass beads were added . This mixture was vortexed for 30 min , to lyse the cells , then 250 m l TE bu(cid:11)er ( pH 8 ) added . The tubes were cen - trifuged at 16 , 000 g for 15 min , and the aqueous phase containing the DNA transferred to a new tube . One - tenth the volume of sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 5 ) and 1 ml of 96 % ethanol were added , and the tubes incubated at - 20 o C for 30 min . Tubes were then centrifuged at 16 , 000 g for 30 min , and the supernatant discarded . The resulting pellet was resuspended in 400 m l TE , to which 4 m l RNase A ( 10 mg / ml ) ( ThermoFisher Scienti(cid:12)c ) was added , then incubated at 37 o C for 10 min , until the pellet was dissolved . Then , 10 m l of 4 M ammonium acetate and 1 ml 96 % ethanol were added , then the tubes centrifuged for 15 min at 16 , 000 g . The supernatant was discarded , and the pellet washed with 500 m l 70 % ethanol . Finally the pellet was left to air - dry and resuspended in 50 m l dH 2 O . The isolated plasmid DNA ( 6 - 8 m l ) could then be transformed into super - competent E . coli 61 cells ( DH5 a ) by heat - shock , and screened for successful recombination as described in the previous sub - section . 2 . 0 . 10 Preparation of heat - shock competent E . coli cells Heat - shock competent E . coli cells were used in the cloning of plasmids , as described in Section 2 . 0 . 9 , and were prepared according to the following protocol . E . coli cells ( strain DH5 a ) were streaked onto a Petri dish containing LB ( without antibiotic ) , and incubated overnight at 37 o C . Two of the resulting colonies were removed with a sterile toothpick and inoculated into 5 ml liquid LB ( without antibiotic ) , and incubated overnight at 37 o C , with shaking at 200 rpm . The following day , 500 m l of the cell cultures were inoculated into (cid:13)asks containing 50 ml of liquid LB ( without antibiotic ) . These (cid:13)asks were incubated at 37 o C with shaking at 200 rpm for 2 - 3 hr until OD 595 reached 0 . 45 - 0 . 55 . The (cid:13)asks were then cooled on ice for up to 30 min , and the contents transferred into pre - cooled falcon tubes . The tubes were centrifuged at 4 o C for 5 min at 2850g in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X - 15R , and the supernatant discarded . The cells were gently resuspended in 25 ml 0 . 1M CaCl 2 ( (cid:12)lter sterilized ) and incubated on ice for 30 min . The cells were then centrifuged again at 4 o C for 5 min at 2850g in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X - 15R , and the supernatant discarded . Pelleted cells were gently resuspended in 5 ml 88 mM CaCl 2 with 12 . 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol . The cell suspension was then aliquoted into sterile Eppendorf tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen . Cells could be stored at - 80 o C until required . 2 . 0 . 11 Cell wall staining Visualization of the fungal cell wall was achieved using a variety of (cid:13)uorescently labelled probes , dyes , lectins and antibodies in conjunction with epi(cid:13)uorescence or confocal mi - croscopy ( detailed in 2 . 0 . 12 ) . Antibodies Two di(cid:11)erent anti - chitosan antibodies were used . The (cid:12)rst , mAbG7 , was a generous gift from the laboratory of Stefan Schillberg ( Schubert et al . , 2010 ) . Germlings developed on either Menzel coverslips or onion epidermis were (cid:12)rst blocked with 2 % BSA ( w / v ) in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature . Samples were washed 3 times with PBS / T ( PBS + 62 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) , for 5 min each on an orbital shaker ( (cid:24) 70rpm ) and then incubated with the primary antibody ( mAbG7 , at 10 m g / ml in PBS ) for 1 . 5 hr at room temperature . This incubation was followed by 3 more washing steps as described above , and incubation with the secondary antibody ( FITC - labelled anti - Mouse IgM , 5 m g / ml in PBS ) at room temperature for a further 1 . 5 hr . Finally , the secondary antibody was removed by 3 more washing steps with PBS / T as described previously and viewed under an epi(cid:13)uorescence or confocal microscope . A negative control was included in all experiments , in which samples were only incubated with the secondary antibody . A second anti - chitosan antibody was a generous gift from the laboratory of Holger Deising ( Gueddari et al . , 2002 ) . Staining with this antibody was performed as described for mAbG7 , except that the antibody was used at a dilution of 1 / 100 from the original antiserum , and the secondary antibody ( a FITC - labelled anti - rabbit IgG ) was used at 10 m g / ml ( in PBS ) . Staining of germlings was also attempted with the anti - pectin antibodies JIM5 , JIM7 and LM19 ( a generous gift from the laboratory of Ian Moore ) . Germlings at 16 hpi were (cid:12)rst washed once with PBS , then incubated for 2 hr with the primary antibodies ( diluted 1 / 20 , 1 / 50 or 1 / 100 in PBS + 1 % BSA ) at room temperature . Primary antibodies were removed by washing 3 times for 5 min each with PBS . This was followed by incubation with the secondary antibody ( TRITC - labelled anti - Rat IgG , IgA , IgM , 10 m g / ml in PBS ) for 2 hr , washing 3 more times as above and viewing under the confocal microscope . A negative control with only secondary antibody was included in all experiments . Lectins The lectins Wheat Germ Agglutinin ( WGA ) and Concanavalin A ( ConA ) were used to stain for chitin and mannan respectively . For staining with WGA - FITC , mycelial pellets were incubated with 2 % BSA in PBS for 1 hr , before being washed 3 times with PBS / T . WGA - FITC ( 10 m g / ml in PBS ) was added and the pellets incubated on ice for 3 - 4 hr . Finally , the pellets were again washed 3 times with PBS / T and viewed under the confocal microscope . Staining of germlings with ConA - FITC was performed as follows : Germlings developed on an arti(cid:12)cial surface were stained with ConA - FITC ( 20 or 40 m g / ml in PBS ) for 20 63 min on ice , before being washed gently with H 2 O twice , then viewed under the confocal microscope . Calco(cid:13)uor white , Eosin Y The (cid:13)uorescent dyes Calco(cid:13)uor White ( CFW ) and Eosin Y were used to stain for chitin and chitosan respectively . In all experiments , unlabelled samples were included to control against auto(cid:13)uorescence . For staining of germlings and mycelia with CFW , samples were incubated with 0 . 05 % CFW ( w / v ) for 20 min at room temperature , washed brie(cid:13)y with H 2 O and then viewed under epi(cid:13)uorescence or confocal microscopes . Staining of conidia with eosin Y was performed essentially as described previously ( Baker et al . , 2007 ) . Brie(cid:13)y , conidia were harvested as described in Section 2 . 0 . 2 , pelleted by centrifugation at 2850g in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X - 15R , then resuspended in McIl - vaine bu(cid:11)er ( pH 6 ) . Conidial concentration was adjusted to 1 x 10 6 conidia / ml . To 500 m l of conidial suspension , 10 m l eosin Y ( 5mg / ml ) was added , and incubated on ice for 30 min . Conidia were washed by centrifugation of the labelled spore suspension at 16 , 000 g for 5 min , removal of the supernatant , and resuspension in 1 ml McIlvaine bu(cid:11)er . This was repeated 3 times , except after the last wash , conidia were resuspended in 100 m l of McIlvaine bu(cid:11)er . Labelled conidia could then be viewed under epi(cid:13)uorescence or confocal microscopes . OGA488 , COS488 The probes OGA488 and COS488 were used to stain for chitosan and polygalacturonic acid respectively , and were generous gifts from the laboratory of William Willats ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) . Staining was performed as described previously ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) : Samples ( germlings or mycelia ) were washed brie(cid:13)y with 25 mM MES ( pH 5 . 6 ) , then incubated with OGA488 or COS488 ( diluted 1 / 1000 in 25 mM MES ) for 15 min on ice . This was followed by 2 - 3 brief washes with 25 mM MES , after which samples could be mounted and viewed under the confocal microscope . 64 2 . 0 . 12 Microscopy Three di(cid:11)erent microscopes were used , depending on experimental requirements . Bright(cid:12)eld and epi(cid:13)uorescence microscopy Bright(cid:12)eld microscopy was performed on an Olympus BX - 50 , typically for examining and recording spore germination assays . Samples were viewed under 20X / 0 . 5 UPlanFL N or 40X / 0 . 75 UPlanFL objective lenses . Pictures were recorded by a Q - Imaging Retiga EX - i Fast 1394 camera and Qcapture Pro software . Epi(cid:13)uorescence microscopy was also performed on the Olympus BX - 50 , with UV illumi - nation . The (cid:12)lter set used depended on the (cid:13)uorophor in question : The NIBA (cid:12)lter was used for eosin Y or FITC , WU was used for CFW . Detector gain and exposure time were adjusted according to (cid:13)uorescence levels . Confocal microscopy Confocal microscopy was performed on either a Zeiss LSM510 Meta or a Leica SP5 . The resulting images presented in this thesis are displayed as maximum projections along the z - axis , unless otherwise stated . For the Zeiss LSM510 , samples were viewed under a Zeiss C - Apochromat water immersion 40X / 1 . 2NA lens and collected at 8 bit data depth . Line averaging was set at either 4 or 8 , scan intervals at 0 . 5 - 2 m m depending on sample thickness and pinhole diameter , which was set at (cid:24) 1 Airy unit ( AU ) , depending on signal strength . Settings used for excitation and emission depended on the (cid:13)uorophors in question . For visualization of CFW stained samples , excitation was at 405 nm from a blue diode laser , and emitted light collected at 500 - 530 nm . For visualization of eGFP tagged proteins or FITC labelled samples , excitation was at 488 nm from an Argon laser and emitted light collected at above 505 nm . For YFP , excitation was at 514 nm from an Argon laser , and emitted light collected between 535 - 590 nm . mCherry or TRITC visualization was achieved by excitation at 543 nm from a Helium - Neon laser , and emitted light collected above 585 nm . The Leica SP5 was used for dual imaging of YFP and mCherry tagged proteins . Samples were viewed under a Leica HC PL APO CS2 63X / 1 . 2 water immersion lens , and collected at 8 bit data depth . Line averaging was set at 8 , scan speed at 400 Hz , scan 65 intervals at 0 . 5 m m and pinhole at 1 Airy Unit . Dual excitation at 514 nm and 543 nm was provided by Argon and Helium - Neon lasers respectively . Emitted light was collected at 500 - 564 nm and 585 - 660 nm . Fluorescence stereomicroscopy Fluorescence stereomicroscopy was used for the localization of (cid:13)uorescently - tagged pro - teins at low magni(cid:12)cation . It was performed on a Zeiss Axio Zoom V16 in the labo - ratory of Professor Kevin Foster , University of Oxford . Colonies of M . oryzae grown on CM , expressing mCherry or eGFP tagged proteins were observed under UV - illumination . Fluorescent heat - maps were inferred from the resulting pictures using Zeiss Zen Lite software . 2 . 0 . 13 Conidial germination assays Conidial germination assays were performed on hydrophobic glass coverslips ( Menzel - Gl(cid:127)aser ) , which provided consistent and convenient conditions for appressorium formation in the absence of a plant surface . Conidia were (cid:12)rst harvested by pipetting 5 ml of water onto a 10 - 12 day old colony growing on CM . This was scraped with a sterile scalpel or microscope slide to create a suspension of conidia and hyphae that was (cid:12)ltered through two layers of Miracloth to isolate the conidia . These were centrifuged at 2850g for 5 min in a Beckman - Coulter Allegra X - 15R , and the supernatant removed . The pellet of conidia was resuspended in 1 ml of dH 2 O , concentration determined by counting on a haemocytometer and adjusted to 2 . 5 x 10 5 conidia / ml ( (cid:12)nal concentration ) . Droplets of conidial suspension ( 50 m l ) were pipetted onto the coverslips which were then placed into a ‘humidity chamber’ ( Tupperware box containing damp tissue paper ) . Incubations were performed at 24 o C for 1 - 24 hr depending on experimental requirements . For ger - minations on hydrophilic glass coverslips ( Heathrow Scienti(cid:12)c ) the protocol was identical except that only 20 m l of conidial suspension was used . Coverslips were placed in square Petri dishes with damp (cid:12)lter paper and sealed with Para(cid:12)lm to prevent evaporation . Germinations were also performed in the presence of various chemical inducers or in - hibitors : IBMX was used at 2 . 5 mM ( from a 250 mM stock in DMSO ) , 1 , 16 hexadecane - diol at 200 m M ( from a 50 mM stock in ethanol ) , diacylglycerol ( Enzo Life Sciences ) at 66 58 m M ( from a 7 . 25 mM stock in DMSO ) , and tricyclazole at 200 m M ( from a 20 mM stock in DMSO ) . Chitosan and its derivatives were used at a (cid:12)nal concentration of 0 . 01 % or 0 . 001 % , from a 1 % stock ( except for FITC - chitosan which was from a 0 . 08 % stock ) . For germinations in the presence of wax ( 1 - octacosanol ) , the wax was (cid:12)rst dissolved in chloroform to a concentration of 4 mg / ml . In a laboratory fume hood , 100 m l of this stock was pipetted onto a hydrophobic glass coverslip and the chloroform allowed to evaporate , leaving a layer of wax on the coverslip . Conidia were inoculated onto this surface as described above . Germination assays were also performed on onion epidermis or Rice leaf sheaths . For ger - mination on onion epidermis , conidia were harvested and prepared as above . Epidermis was removed from onions ( Tescos ) with a scalpel and placed on a Petri dish containing 2 % Agar . Epidermises were kept (cid:13)at by placement of coverslips on the top and bottom edges and inoculated with 50 m l droplets of conidial suspensions . Incubation was as dis - cussed above , usually for 24 hr . For germination on Rice , sheaths were harvested from 3 - 4 week old plants ( cultivar CO - 39 ) and placed in a Petri dish containing 2 % agar . Conidial suspension was pipetted into the centre of the sheath and incubated as discussed above . 2 . 0 . 14 Conidial adhesion assays Adhesion assays were performed on both hydrophobic and hydrophilic glass coverslips ( detailed in 2 . 0 . 13 ) . Conidia were harvested and diluted as described previously ( 2 . 0 . 13 ) . 20 m l droplets of conidial suspension ( either with or without 0 . 01 % chitosan ) of each strain were pipetted onto the coverslips , which were placed into a humidity chamber and incubated at 24 o C for 2 hr to allow germination . At 2 hpi , half of the coverslips were removed and placed into a 50 mm Petri dish containing 5 ml dH 2 O , and shaken on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 5 min . Coverslips were then removed and mounted on slides for viewing under the 10X objective lens of the Olympus BX50 microscope ( detailed in 2 . 0 . 12 ) . Conidia were counted from one (cid:12)eld of view ( for hydrophobic coverslips ) or three (cid:12)elds of view ( for hydrophilic coverslips ) , with a conscious e(cid:11)ort made to locate the area of the coverslip with the highest conidial density . For each strain , the number of conidia counted on the washed coverslips was compared with those counted on the unwashed coverslips , and percentage conidial adhesion calculated as : 100 - ( ( conidia on unwashed 67 coverslip - conidia on washed coverslip ) (cid:4) conidia on unwashed coverslip ) x 100 . 2 . 0 . 15 Pathogenicity assays Pathogenicity assays were performed on both rice ( Oryza sativa , cultivar CO - 39 ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare , cultivar ‘Golden Promise’ ) . For barley , leaves were harvested from 7 day old plants grown as described in Section 2 . 0 . 17 , and placed on square Petri dishes containing 2 % agar . The top and bottom of the leaves were weighed down with glass microscope slides to keep them (cid:13)at . Conidia were harvested as described previously ( 2 . 0 . 13 ) , and diluted to a (cid:12)nal concentration of 6 . 25 x 10 4 conidia / ml in 0 . 2 % gelatine ( w / v ) . The leaves were then sprayed from a (cid:12)xed distance with 2 ml of the conidial suspension , using an airbrush ( Badger ) . Inoculated leaves were incubated at 24 o C for 5 days , after which the leaves were photographed and lesions counted . For assays on rice leaves , plants were grown as described in Section 2 . 0 . 17 for 3 - 4 weeks . Only the (cid:12)rst and second youngest leaves were harvested from plants , in order to achieve greater consistency . These leaves were treated with 2 % bleach ( v / v ) for 30 seconds , then washed 3 times with dH 2 O and allowed to air dry . Dry leaves were placed on square Petri dishes containing 2 % agar , and kept (cid:13)at with glass microscope slides as described for barley leaves . Conidia were harvested as described previously and inoculated as described above , except that the concentration used was 2 . 5 x 10 5 conidia / ml . Inoculated leaves were incubated at 24 o C for 4 days , then photographed . A mock inoculation was included in all experiments , in which leaves were only sprayed with 0 . 2 % gelatine ( w / v ) . 2 . 0 . 16 Synthesis of FITC - chitosan FITC - labelled chitosan was synthesized as described previously ( Qaqish and Amiji , 1999 ) - One gramme of chitosan was dissolved in 100 ml of 0 . 1M acetic acid . To the chitosan solution , 100 ml of methanol was slowly added with continuous stirring . A 1 mg / ml solution of FITC in methanol was then slowly added , such that the (cid:12)nal molar ratio of FITC : glucosamine was 1 : 50 . The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1hr in the dark , at room temperature . The resulting FITC - chitosan was precipitated by the addition of 0 . 1M NaOH . In order to remove unreacted FITC , the precipitate was washed by suspending it in dH 2 O , followed by centrifugation and removal of the supernatant . This was repeated 68 until the absorbance of the supernatant at 492 nm ( the absorbance maximum of FITC ) was < 0 . 01 . Washed FITC - chitosan was then freeze dried and stored at - 20 o C until needed . For use in germination assays , the FITC - chitosan was dissolved in 1 % acetic acid , and the pH adjusted to (cid:24) 6 by the addition of NaOH . This solution was then dialyzed overnight against dH 2 O , to remove the sodium and acetate . 2 . 0 . 17 Growth of Rice and Barley Rice and barley plants were grown in a Weiss - Gallenkamp Fitotron SGC - 120 at 24 o C , 60 % relative humidity . Light was provided by 36 W (cid:13)uorescent tubes , supplying a maximum light intensity of 170 m mol m (cid:0) 2 s (cid:0) 1 , with 14 hr light / 10 hr dark . Rice seeds of the cultivar CO - 39 , which is susceptible to M . oryzae , were planted in John Innes no . 3 compost , and placed in the growth chamber . Plants were incubated for 3 - 4 weeks with regular watering . For barley , seeds of the cultivar ‘Golden Promise’ were planted in 50 % John Innes no . 2 / 50 % multipurpose compost , and placed in the growth chamber . Plants were incubated for 7 days with regular watering . 69 Chapter 3 Chitin deacetylation and appressorium development 70 3 . 1 Objectives As discussed previously , there are two key hypotheses regarding the role of chitin deacety - lation . The (cid:12)rst concerns a putative ‘stealth mechanism’ , whereby deacetylation of chitin prevents cell wall digestion by plant chitinases , and reduces the production of chitin PAMPs which can trigger a plant defence response . The second hypothesis is that chitin deacetylation causes a signi(cid:12)cant change in the properties of the cell wall and is therefore important for morphogenesis . Clearly , these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive , al - though it is possible that the protective role and the developmental role of chitosan may be spatially or temporally separated . The process of appressorium development presents an opportunity to test both of these hypotheses simultaneously . The production of the large , dome - shaped appressorium from the tip of a narrow germ tube should conceivably require a large increase in localized cell wall (cid:13)exibility that may come about as a result of chitin deacetylation . In addition , successful appressorium development on a leaf surface requires protection from destructive factors ; this was shown in the a 1 , 3 - glucan synthase deletion strain , where loss of a 1 , 3 - glucan resulted in the destruction of the germling even before plant penetration ( Fujikawa et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , loss of chitosan during germling morphogenesis could either result in defective appressorium development , or destruction of appressoria on plant surfaces ( or a combination of both ) . Another reason for the suitability of appressorium formation as a system in which to test hypotheses regarding chitin deacetylation is the availability of intriguing previous data . Firstly , chitosan has been found to be a component of germ tubes and appressoria in M . oryzae ( Fujikawa et al . , 2009 ) . Secondly , deletion of a putative chitin deacetylase called Cbp1 resulted in defective appressorium formation on arti(cid:12)cial surfaces , although no loss of chitosan was observed and appressorium formation was restored on plant surfaces and by chemical inducers ( Kamakura et al . , 2002 ; Tucker et al . , 2010 ) . This previous work provides a good basis for continued characterization of the role of chitin deacetylation during ap - pressorium development . The objectives of this Chapter are to : (cid:15) Con(cid:12)rm the presence of chitosan during appressorium development (cid:15) Identify which chitin deacetylases are expressed during appressorium development 71 (cid:15) Perform targeted deletion of identi(cid:12)ed genes , in order to abolish chitin deacetylation during appressorium formation (cid:15) Investigate appressorium development and pathogenicity in the deletion strains 3 . 2 Results Chitosan is a component of the cell wall in germ tubes and appressoria Previous work investigating the localization of chitosan during appressorium development in M . oryzae employed the dye eosin Y ( tetrabromo(cid:13)uorescein ) , which binds to chitosan via an electrostatic interaction ( Fujikawa et al . , 2009 ) . However , attempts to localize chitosan using this dye were met with limited success here ; the dye proved extremely susceptible to internalization , and often accumulated in the cytoplasm of conidia , germ tubes and appressoria in both live and (cid:12)xed cells . In addition , the speci(cid:12)city of this interaction has not been directly proven ; eosin Y could presumably interact and stain any cell wall component with a positive charge . With this in mind , alternative means of labelling chitosan were sought . Other studies of chitosan localization in fungi have used anti - chitosan antibodies which have proven speci(cid:12)city , and are therefore preferable to eosin Y . Two di(cid:11)erent antibodies were obtained : mAbG7 , a monoclonal anti - chitosan antibody ( a generous gift from the laboratory of Stefan Schillberg ( Schubert et al . , 2010 ) ) , and a polyclonal anti - chitosan antibody , a generous gift from the laboratory of Holger Deising ( Gueddari et al . , 2002 ) . In order to allow labelling of un(cid:12)xed germlings , conidia were (cid:12)rst inoculated onto an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic glass surface which e(cid:11)ectively induces appressorium development in M . oryzae ( Lee and Dean , 1994 ) . The labelling of the un - (cid:12)xed germlings with these antibodies at 16 hpi con(cid:12)rmed the previous (cid:12)ndings with eosin Y : chitosan localizes to the germ tube and appressorium , although weak labelling of the conidial wall was also observed in some cases , particularly with the polyclonal antibody ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . In addition to con(cid:12)rming these previous results however , it was also of in - terest to determine the precise time points at which chitin deacetylation occurs ; if chitin deacetylation was found to occur after appressorium development , this would suggest that it is not required for this process . Although this could have been determined using the antibodies , there are two drawbacks of using antibodies for this experiment : Firstly , 72 staining germlings with antibodies takes in excess of 4 hours to complete , by which time appressorium formation would have occurred in live cells ( although admittedly , (cid:12)xing the samples would have circumvented this problem ) . Secondly , the anti - chitosan an - tibodies do not demonstrate absolute speci(cid:12)city for chitosan . Rather , binding a(cid:14)nity increases in proportion to the degree of chitin deacetylation . As a result , a small amount of binding to chitin is observed in vitro for these antibodies , which may explain the staining of the conidial wall observed ( Schubert et al . , 2010 ; Gueddari et al . , 2002 ) . For - tunately , a recently developed probe for chitosan addresses both of these issues ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) . OGA488 is an Alexa - (cid:13)uor 488 labelled oligomer of galacturonic acid . As a negatively charged molecule , OGA488 interacts electrostatically with the polycationic chitosan . However , charge is not the only factor determining the speci(cid:12)city of this in - teraction : a molecular modelling approach demonstrated that the amine and carboxy groups of chitosan and OGA488 respectively are arranged in a unique stereochemical manner which results in highly speci(cid:12)c binding ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) . This means that OGA488 does not bind at all to chitin , binds weakly to partially deacetylated chitin , and strongly to fully deacetylated chitin ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) . The second major advantage of OGA488 over the antibodies is that labelling can be completed in just 15 min . This allowed observation of chitin deacetylation at early stages of germling morphogenesis , in live cells . When germlings developing on an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surface were labelled with OGA488 at 1 - 2 hpi , weak labelling of the germ tube was observed . This labelling either covered the entire length of the germ tube , or was initially localized to a small ‘patch’ . OGA488 labelling appeared to intensify upon onset of germ tube hooking ( 2 - 3 hpi ) , and further still during appressorium development ( 4 hpi ) , covering the entirety of the germ tube and appressorium , much like the labelling observed with the anti - chitosan antibodies ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . M . oryzae has 10 putative chitin deacetylases Having established that chitin is deacetylated both prior to and during appressorium development , the next objective was to determine which CDAs were responsible . In order to do this , (cid:12)rst all of the CDA genes present in the genome of M . oryzae needed to be identi(cid:12)ed . Using the protein sequence of Cbp1 , a BLAST search was performed on 73 Figure 3 . 1 : Chitosan is a component of the cell wall in germ tubes and appressoria . Germlings labelled with A ) monoclonal anti - chitosan antibody mAbG7 , B ) polyclonal antichi - tosan antibody and C ) the anti - chitosan probe OGA488 . Staining of germ tubes and appressoria was observed in all cases . The rapid staining with OGA488 allowed localization of chitosan in live cells at di(cid:11)erent stages of appressorium development ( 2 - 16 hpi , clockwise from left to right ) . Staining with antibodies was performed at 16 hpi . Germlings were developed on a hydrophobic glass surface . Scale bars : 10 m m . 74 the M . oryzae protein database ( BLOSUM62 , gapped alignment , E - value cut - o(cid:11) of 1e - 3 ) . A Pfam domain search was performed on the resulting hits , and any sequences which did not include a Polysaccharide Deacetylase - 1 domain ( Pfam 01522 ) were discarded . Generally , these were proteins that included chitin - binding domains ( Pfam 00187 ) , but no catalytic domains . This resulted in the identi(cid:12)cation of 10 putative chitin deacetylases , shown in Figure 3 . 2 . Subsequent BLAST searches with these newly - identi(cid:12)ed proteins did not discover any further putative chitin deacetylase sequences . All the CDAs have a polysaccharide / chitin deacetylase domain ( CDA ; Pfam 01522 ) , and all CDAs except Cda9 have an N - terminal signal peptide , suggesting extracellular localization . Chitin binding domains ( CBD ; Pfam 00187 ) are also present in some CDAs , including Cbp1 , which also has a serine / threonine - rich repeat region at its C - terminus , as remarked upon previously ( Kamakura et al . , 2002 ) . Interestingly , Cda4 , Cda5 and Cda8 have putative single transmembrane domains , suggesting membrane localization for these proteins . The catalytic mechanism of a chitin deacetylase from the plant pathogen Colletotrichum lindemuthianum has been elucidated using structural and biochemical data ( Hekmat et al . , 2003 ; Blair et al . , 2006 ) . This chitin deacetylase was found to be a zinc - dependant metalloenzyme , where the zinc ion is bound by a Asp - His - His triad ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . Four key active - site residues were also de(cid:12)ned : The catalytic base residue ( aspartate ) and catalytic acid residue ( histamine ) , which interact with arginine and aspartate residues respectively . In order to determine whether these residues were conserved in the M . oryzae CDAs , the sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega ( Sievers et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . This revealed that the zinc - binding triad and active - site residues are indeed conserved in all of the sequences analyzed , with the exception of the non - catalytic aspartate in Cbp1 . A phylogenetic analysis of the chitin deacetylases was also attempted , in order to shed light on the distribution and evolutionary relationships of these enzymes amongst di(cid:11)erent species of fungi . Unfortunately , this family proved to be exceptionally di(cid:14)cult to resolve , primarily due to the short length of the conserved CDA domain , and the low degree of sequence conservation within it . It was therefore not possible to reliably infer a phylogeny . A previous study did investigate the evolutionary relationships of the chitin deacetylases ( Ruiz - Herrera and Ortiz - Castellanos , 2010 ) , but this only included three species of ascomycete and su(cid:11)ered from poor boostrap - support . 75 Figure 3 . 2 : M . oryzae has 10 putative chitin deacetylases . A ) Table of the 10 chitin deacetylase genes in Magnaporthe oryzae , showing gene numbers , given gene names and protein domain architectures ( as de(cid:12)ned by Pfam ) . B ) Alignment of M . oryzae CDAs with those from C . lindemuthianum and S . cerevisiae . Conserved active site residues are marked in green boxes , and the zinc binding triad in blue boxes . 76 Chitin deacetylases are highly expressed during appressorium development In order to determine which of the 10 CDAs were expressed during appressorium devel - opment , two transcriptional pro(cid:12)ling methods were used . The (cid:12)rst simply involved ex - ploiting an existing transcriptomics dataset . Soanes et al ( 2012 ) performed genome - wide transcriptional analysis of M . oryzae during several stages of appressorium development on an arti(cid:12)cial inductive surface ( Soanes et al . , 2012 ) . By searching this dataset for all 10 CDAs , the transcript abundances for these genes at 4 hpi during appressorium de - velopment could be determined ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . This revealed that CDA3 was by far the most highly expressed CDA , followed by CBP1 and CDA2 . Low or non - existent expres - sion was found for the remaining genes . To independently verify this data , a second method was employed . Semi - quantitative RT - PCR was performed on RNA isolated from germlings developing either on rice leaves ( harvested at 4 hpi ) or te(cid:13)on ( harvested at 5 hpi ) . Te(cid:13)on is a hydrophobic surface which can arti(cid:12)cially induce appressorium for - mation in M . oryzae , although development of appressoria was observed to occur more slowly on this surface ( not shown ) , hence the harvesting of germlings at 5 hpi instead of 4 hpi . Results of the RT - PCR experiments were broadly in line with those from the transcriptomics dataset ; CDA3 , CBP1 and CDA2 had the greatest transcript abundance , although transcript levels for CDA4 also appeared to be comparable to CDA2 in this analysis ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . Results from RT - PCR analysis of germlings harvested from te(cid:13)on were slightly di(cid:11)erent from those on rice leaves , in that expression was detected for a number of CDA genes that were not detected on rice leaves . However , this is likely due to the much higher proportion of fungal RNA present in germling samples from Te(cid:13)on compared with those from rice leaves ( which is mainly plant RNA ) . Reducing the num - ber of ampli(cid:12)cation cycles would have been bene(cid:12)cial in this case . In all cases , parallel experiments were performed in which the RNA had not been reverse transcribed ( - RT control ) . No ampli(cid:12)cation was observed in these experiments , proving that any observed ampli(cid:12)cation was due to cDNA and not gDNA contamination . Semi - quantitative RT - PCR experiments were repeated a total of two times with independently prepared RNA samples ; identical results were obtained in each case . 77 Figure 3 . 3 : Chitin deacetylases are highly expressed during appressorium develop - ment . Expression of CDA genes during appressorium formation , comparing data from tran - scriptomics ( Soanes et al . , 2012 ) , expressed in Fragments per Kilobase per Million ( FPKM ) , and semi - quantitative RT - PCR of RNA isolated from germlings developing on rice leaves or te(cid:13)on ( an arti(cid:12)cial inductive surface ) . (cid:12) - tubulin is included as the reference gene . Primers used are listed in Appendix E ( primers 84 - 107 ) . Deletion of chitin deacetylases The data outlined above suggests that there are at least three CDA genes correlated with chitin deacetylation during appressorium development : CBP1 , CDA2 , and CDA3 . Although CBP1 has previously been deleted and characterized , as discussed previously ( see section 3 . 1 ) , it was considered that redundancy may exist between these identi(cid:12)ed genes . With this in mind , single , double and triple deletion strains were generated by the targeted gene replacement approach , whereby the genes of interest were replaced by an antibiotic resistance gene ( Figure 3 . 4A ) . Homologous recombination between the gene replacement cassette and the (cid:13)anking regions of the gene of interest results in gene re - placement ( Figure 3 . 4A ) . In most cases , the entire coding region of the gene was replaced . However , in the case of CBP1 , due to apparent misannotation of this gene , only the (cid:12)rst (cid:24) 2 kb of the (cid:24) 2 . 6 kb coding sequence was replaced . Since this included the signal pep - tide and catalytic domain , it can still be considered a functional knockout strain . Primers used for the creation of deletion cassettes are listed in Appendix E ( Primers 1 - 26 ) . Putative deletion strains were (cid:12)rst screened by PCR , to con(cid:12)rm the loss of the target gene and the integration of the resistance gene at the correct locus ( not shown ) . Con - (cid:12)rmed strains were then subjected to Southern blot analysis , to con(cid:12)rm the presence of a single insertion of the deletion cassette at the desired locus . In all single gene deletion 78 strains , genes were replaced with HPH , conferring resistance to hygromycin . Restriction - digested genomic DNA of these putative deletion strains was therefore hybridised with a - 32 P - labelled DNA encoding HPH . Hybridisation with Xho I digested gDNA of 7 pu - tative CBP1 deletion strains , resulted in the expected 5 kb band in all lines , with no ectopic insertions . Bgl I digest of gDNA from putative CDA2 deletion strains resulted in an expected band at 3 . 7 kb , although with an additional insertion in one of the lines . For putative CDA3 deletion strains , Eco RI digest resulted in the expected 4 . 7 kb band , although with additional insertions in two of the lines ( Figure 3 . 4B ) . Once the single deletion strains had been successfully generated , they were used as the background strains for the creation of double deletion strains . Because CDA2 was the most challenging gene to delete , the cda2 mutant was used as a background strain for two of the deletions ( cda2 / cbp1 and cda2 / cda3 ) . CDA3 proved to be the easiest gene to delete , and so the cbp1 mutant was used as the background strain for cbp1 / cda3 . In these strains , the target sequence was replaced by BAR , conferring resistance to bialaphos . Southern blot analysis therefore involved hybridisation of a - 32 P - labelled DNA encoding BAR to restriction digested gDNA of the putative deletion strains . However , since both HPH and BAR have similar promoter sequences , some cross - hybridisation was apparent ; faint bands resulted from the BAR probe hybridising to HPH from the (cid:12)rst deletion . In fact , this could be considered bene(cid:12)cial , since it allowed both gene deletions to be con(cid:12)rmed in the same analysis . For cda2 / cbp1 , Xho I digestion gave the expected 4 . 5 kb band , but also a faint 5 . 3 kb band resulting from hybridisation of BAR to HPH at the CDA2 locus ( the cda2 strain was included as a control ) . An ectopic insertion was apparent in one of the cda2 / cbp1 lines ( band at 10 kb ) . For cda2 / cda3 , Eco RI digestion resulted in the expected 4 . 2 kb band , as well as the expected 8 . 6 kb band for hybridisation to HPH at the CDA2 locus . Lastly , for cbp1 / cda3 , Cla I digestion resulted in the expected 4 . 7 kb band , as well as the expected (cid:24) 9 kb band for hybridisation of the BAR probe to HPH at the CBP1 locus ( Figure 3 . 4C ) . Lastly , a triple deletion strain cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 was made in the cda2 / cbp1 background strain . In this case , CDA3 was replaced by the sulphonylurea - resistant allele of aceto - lactate synthase ( ALS ) . Because the background strain already contains the WT allele of this gene , hybridisation of the ALS probe to both alleles is expected in the Southern 79 blot analysis . Eco RI digest of gDNA from two putative triple knockouts resulted in the expected 6 . 1 kb band for replacement of CDA3 , and also a band at 19 kb , as expected for hybridisation to the WT ALS allele ( Figure 3 . 4D ) . All deletion strains are listed in Appendix F . Chitosan is required for appressorium development on arti(cid:12)cial surfaces CBP1 is known to be required for normal appressorium development in M . oryzae ( Ka - makura et al . , 2002 ) . To con(cid:12)rm these previous (cid:12)ndings , and to investigate appressorium development in the other deletion strains , conidia of each of the strains were inoculated onto an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic glass surface ( Menzel coverslips ) . In the WT strain , over 80 % of conidia developed appressoria after an 8hr incubation . However , in cbp1 , almost no appressoria formed , and germ tubes were abnormally elongated and failed to even undergo early di(cid:11)erentiation events ( e . g . germ tube hooking ) , consistent with the previ - ous report ( Figure 3 . 5 ) ( Kamakura et al . , 2002 ) . Conidial germination of cbp1 at 1 hpi was not lower than WT , suggesting that the lack of appressorium development was not due to delayed or reduced germination . Extending the incubation to 16 hr did result in appressorium formation in cbp1 , although these were frequently misshapen ( Figure 3 . 5B ) . In the cda2 , cda3 and cda2 / cda3 strains , appressorium development and conidial germination were similar to WT . However , deletion of CDA2 together with CBP1 re - sulted in much more severe defects in appressorium development than observed in the single deletion strains . cda2 / cbp1 failed to form appressoria by 8 hpi , as in cbp1 , but extending the incubation period to 24 hpi did not result in appressorium development , in contrast to cbp1 . Instead , germ tubes appeared even more elongated , yet remained smooth and undi(cid:11)erentiated ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . This phenotype was also observed when coni - dia were germinated on other hydrophobic surfaces , including plastic and Para(cid:12)lm ( not shown ) . CDA2 and CBP1 therefore exhibit partial redundancy . Conversely , deletion of Figure 3 . 4 ( following page ) : Targeted deletion of CBP1 , CDA2 and CDA3 .

Blots containing restriction digested gDNA of putative deletion strains were hybridised with a - 32 P labelled DNA homologous to the hygromycin , bialaphos or sulphonylurea resistance genes respectively . The cartoon above each blot shows the expected band size based upon the position of the restriction enzyme sites at each locus . Size markers show band size in kilobases ( kb ) . 80 81 CDA3 had no additive e(cid:11)ects on appressorium development under the conditions tested : cbp1 / cda3 demonstrated an identical phenotype to cbp1 , and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 an identical phenotype to cda2 / cbp1 . Germlings of the deletion strains were then stained for chitosan , using the chitosan - speci(cid:12)c probe OGA488 . Germlings of the WT strain developed on an arti(cid:12)cial hydropho - bic surface for 16 hr demonstrated strong staining of the cell wall in germ tubes and ap - pressoria as described previously , and similar staining was observed in cda2 / cda3 ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . In cbp1 and cbp1 / cda3 appressoria continued to show labelling with OGA488 , but little (cid:13)uorescence was observed on the elongated germ tubes of these strains . However , in cda2 / cbp1 and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 no chitosan staining was observed at all , suggesting complete loss of chitin deacetylation in these strains , and providing further evidence of the redundancy between cbp1 and cda2 . Staining was also performed at 24 hpi . At this timepoint , a small proportion ( 10 - 20 % ) of germ tubes in cda2 / cbp1 and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 ( Figure 3 . 5 ) did form appressoria . However , no chitosan was detected in these appres - soria ( Figure 3 . 14B ) , suggesting that it is not an absolute requirement for appressorium morphogenesis . The highly elongated germ tubes observed in cbp1 , cda2 / cbp1 and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 were a curious feature . In order to determine whether these germ tubes were a single cell or were in fact multiple cells , Calco(cid:13)uor White staining was performed . This revealed that the germ tubes were indeed septate ; septa appeared to be distributed along the germ tubes of cbp1 and cda2 / cbp1 at regular intervals ( Figure 3 . 5C ) . Taken together , these data suggest a clear link between the loss of chitin deacetyla - tion , and loss of appressorium development . However , the mechanism by which chitin deacetylation promotes appressorium development remains unclear . Localization of chitin deacetylases In an attempt to shed further light on the mechanism by which chitin deacetylation by Cbp1 and Cda2 promotes appressorium development , (cid:13)uorescent protein fusions were cre - ated . CBP1 and CDA2 ( without the stop codons ) were ampli(cid:12)ed using primer pairs 47 / 48 and 49 / 50 respectively ( Appendix E ) , then cloned into the pUCAP vector at the Asc I site ( Appendix D ) . This created a C - terminal mCherry fusion to the respective proteins 82 Figure 3 . 5 : Appressorium development and chitin deacetylation are dramatically reduced in the CDA deletion strains . A ) Table showing percentage conidial germination ( at 1 hpi ) , and appressorium formation ( at 8 hpi ) on an arti(cid:12)cial inductive surface ( Menzel glass coverslips ) ( (cid:6) SD , n = 3 ) , showing highly reduced appressorium formation in certain deletion strains . B ) Fluorescent labelling of chitosan on the germlings of CDA deletion strains at 16 hpi , showing lack of staining in the cda2 / cbp1 and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strains . C ) Calco(cid:13)uor White staining of germlings at 16 hpi , showing abnormally elongated , septate germ tubes ( white arrow heads ) . Scale bars : 20 m m . 83 when expressed . In both cases , expression of the fusion constructs was driven by native promoters : (cid:24) 2 kb of upstream sequence was included for CBP1mCherry , and (cid:24) 1 . 3 kb for CDA2mCherry ( due to proximity of a neighbouring gene ) . The fusion constructs were transformed into the deletion background strains , and the resulting antibiotic - resistant transformants screened for (cid:13)uorescence . For each construct , several transformant lines were identi(cid:12)ed exhibiting identical patterns of (cid:13)uorescence ( listed in Appendix F ) , which were examined during appressorium development on a hydrophobic glass surface . Strains expressing Cbp1 : mCherry exhibited (cid:13)uorescence at all stages of appressorium development ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . Unexpectedly , (cid:13)uorescence was observed at conidial apices ( Figure 3 . 6A ) , even in conidia which had not yet been harvested from the mycelium . Substantial intracellular (cid:13)uorescence was also observed at this stage , most likely local - ized to vacuoles . During stages of germ tube growth ( 1 - 2 hpi ) , weak (cid:13)uorescence was observed at the lateral walls of the germ tube , but not the tip ( Figure 3 . 6B ) . In addi - tion , small punctae of intracellular (cid:13)uorescence were sometimes observed along the length of the germ tube which could either be vacuoles or other intracellular compartments of unknown identity . At later stages of appressorium development ( 3 - 5 hpi ) , wall - localized (cid:13)uorescence became stronger and localized to the entire germ tube and appressorium , although intracellular (cid:13)uorescence was still apparent in some appressoria ( Figure 3 . 6C ) . The appressorial wall remained (cid:13)uorescent even at later stages ( 8 - 16 hpi ) , although inten - sity decreased noticeably . In order to determine whether the Cbp1 : mCherry fusion pro - tein was functional , appressorium development was tested in the complemented strains . Conidia of the complemented strains germinated on an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surface for 8 hr demonstrated identical appressorium development to the WT strain ( Figure 3 . 6D ) , con(cid:12)rming the functionality of Cbp1 : mCherry . This was found for all three lines of the complemented strain , but only quanti(cid:12)ed for one . Similar to Cbp1 : mCherry , strains expressing Cda2 : mCherry also exhibited (cid:13)uores - cence during appressorium development , although it was notably absent at the very earliest stages of conidial germination i . e . in conidia or in germ tubes . The earliest point at which Cda2mCherry (cid:13)uorescence was observed was typically after hooking of the germ tube ( Figure 3 . 6E ) . Strong (cid:13)uorescence was also observed during subsequent appressorium formation ( Figure 3 . 6F ) , and remained present at later stages ( 8 - 16 hpi ) , as 84 observed with Cbp1 : mCherry . Unlike Cbp1 : mCherry however , (cid:13)uorescence was only very rarely observed intracellularly . Since the cda2 strain was apparently identical to the WT strain , functionality of the fusion protein could not be determined in the complemented strain . An attempt was also made to create a Cda3 : eGFP fusion protein . Unfortunately , no (cid:13)uorescent transformants were obtained for this construct , suggesting instability of the fusion protein . Cbp1 : mCherry and Cda2 : mCherry colocalize with Chs7 : 2xYFP Chitin synthase 7 ( Chs7 ) has previously been found to be required for appressorium development in M . oryzae ( Odenbach et al . , 2009 ; Kong et al . , 2012 ) . In fact , deletion of CHS7 resulted in a phenotype that is identical to that observed in cda2 / cbp1 and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 . Furthermore , Chs7 : eGFP localized to germ tubes and developing ap - pressoria , in a similar fashion to Cbp1 : mCherry and Cda2 : mCherry . It was hypothesized that these proteins may colocalize , perhaps indicating a degree of coordination between chitin synthesis and deacetylation . To test this hypothesis , (cid:12)rst a Chs7 : eGFP fusion was created , in precisely the same way as reported previously ( Kong et al . , 2012 ) : CHS7 was ampli(cid:12)ed using primers 58 and 59 ( Appendix E ) , and cloned into the AscI site of the pUCAP plasmid ( Appendix D ) . This created a C - terminal eGFP fusion in the result - ing protein , which was expressed by the native promoter ( (cid:24) 1 kb of upstream sequence ) . This construct was previously shown to be able to complement the defects in the chs7 mutant , suggesting full functionality of the protein ( Kong et al . , 2012 ) . However , when transformed into the WT background strain , only weak (cid:13)uorescence was observed , which made imaging challenging . To overcome this problem , a new construct was created , in which two copies of YFPvenus replaced the single eGFP . Transformants expressing this construct displayed stronger (cid:13)uorescence , but with apparently identical localization to the eGFP construct . The CBP1 : mCherry and CDA2 : mCherry constructs were transformed into the CHS7 : 2xYFP background strain , and resulting antibiotic - resistant transformants screened for (cid:13)uorescence . As before , several independent lines for each construct were visualized , exhibiting identical patterns of (cid:13)uorescence ( listed in Appendix F ) . In strains co - expressing Chs7 : 2xYFP and Cbp1 : mCherry , partial colocalization were 85 Figure 3 . 6 : Localization of mCherry tagged Cbp1 and Cda2 . A - C ) Confocal (cid:13)uorescence microscopy images of germlings expressing Cbp1 : mCherry , showing (cid:13)uorescence in conidial apices ( white arrow heads ) , germ tubes and appressoria at 0 - 4 hpi on hydrophobic glass .

Error bars show SD , n = 3 . E & F ) Confocal (cid:13)uorescence microscopy images of germlings expressing Cda2 : mCherry at 2 - 4 hpi . Scale bars : 10 m m . 86 observed , depending on the developmental stage in question ( Figure 3 . 7 ) . During germ tube growth , Cbp1 : mCherry localized to lateral walls of the germ tube , and intracel - lularly as described previously . Chs7 : 2xYFP also localized intracellularly , and partially colocalizaed with Cbp1 : mCherry in the germ tube , and particularly in the apical cell of conidia ( Figure 3 . 7A ) . However , unlike Cbp1 : mCherry , Chs7 : 2xYFP was observed at plasma membrane of the germ tube tip , as reported previously ( Odenbach et al . , 2009 ) , but not at the lateral walls . Thus , colocalization of these proteins at the cell periphery was not observed during germ tube growth . During appressorium development , colocal - ization was observed ; Chs7 : 2xYFP localized to the cell periphery of the appressorium , as did Cbp1 : mCherry ( Figure 3 . 7B ) . Importantly however , the distribution of (cid:13)uorescence was not identical for both fusion proteins . Chs7 : 2xYFP appeared to be restricted to the bottom 1 - 2 m m of the appressorium , forming a band of (cid:13)uorescence at the base of the appressorium . In contrast , Cbp1 : mCherry localized to the entire appressorium . Intra - cellular (cid:13)uorescence was also observed during appressorium formation for Chs7 : 2xYFP , which also colocalized with Cbp1 : mCherry . In strains co - expressing Chs7 : 2xYFP and Cda2 : mCherry , partial colocalization at the cell periphery was observed at the germ tube hooking stage ( 3 . 7C ) . In developed appressoria , Chs7 : 2xYFP localized to the cell periphery at the base of the appressorium , and Cda2 : mCherry localized to the entire cell wall of the appressorium ( 3 . 7D ) . Exogenous chitosan can rescue CDA deletion strains The highly elongated germ tubes observed upon deletion of CDA genes were similar to that resulting from deletion of the hydrophobin gene MPG1 ( Talbot et al . , 1993 ) . In - terestingly , it was reported that appressorium development could be rescued in the mpg1 mutant by co - inoculation with WT conidia , suggesting that Mpg1 could act in trans ( Beckerman and Ebbole , 1996 ) . To test whether chitosan could also act in a similar manner , exogenous chitosan was added to conidia of the cda mutants during germina - tion on an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surface . Surprisingly , the addition of 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) or 0 . 001 % ( w / v ) chitosan could restore appressorium development in all of the cda deletion strains ( Figure 3 . 8 ) . In the cbp1 , cda2 / cbp1 and cbp1 / cda3 strains , 70 - 85 % of conidia formed appressoria after an 8 hr incubation in the presence of 0 . 01 % or 0 . 001 % chitosan , 87 Figure 3 . 7 : Cbp1 : mCherry and Cda2 : mCherry colocalize with YFP - tagged Chitin Synthase VII . Confocal (cid:13)uorescence microscopy images , showing colocalization of A & B ) Cbp1 : mCherry and C & D ) Cda2 : mCherry with YFP tagged chitin synthase VII , during ap - pressorium development . Colocalization at the cell periphery was particularly evident during germ tube hooking and early stages of appressorium di(cid:11)erentiation . In addition , colocalization of intracellular punctae in strains co - expressing CBP1 : mCherry and CHS7 : 2xYFP also occurred . Fluorescence has been pseudocoloured white in the mCherry and YFP panels , for clarity . Scale bars : 10 m m . Note : Picture brightness and contrast have been increased to improve clarity upon printing . 88 compared with 0 - 10 % in the control treatment ( water ) . In the triple deletion strain cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 rescue was slightly lower ( 55 % (cid:6) 17 and 70 % (cid:6) 16 appressoria at 8 hpi for 0 . 01 % and 0 . 001 % chitosan respectively ) , although extending in incubation time was observed to increase rescue ( not shown ) . In the WT strain , 70 - 85 % of conidia formed appressoria in all treatments . To further investigate the relationship between chitosan and appressorium development , di(cid:11)erent derivatives and formulations of chitosan were tested for their ability to restore appressorium development in the deletion strains ( struc - tures are shown in Figure 3 . 8C ) . Glycol chitosan , a soluble derivative of chitosan could restore appressorium development in cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 at a concentration of 0 . 01 % but not 0 . 001 % . Carboxymethylchitosan , in which an anionic carboxymethyl group has been introduced , could not restore appressorium formation at either concentration . Lastly , the addition of chitosan in oligomeric form ( oligochitosan ) could partially restore appresso - rium formation at 8 hpi ( with more complete rescue observed after a 16hr incubation ( not shown ) ) , whereas glucosamine showed no restorative e(cid:11)ects at all . Taken together , these data suggest that the cationic nature of exogenous chitosan is the most important factor determining rescue , with steric factors also having some in(cid:13)uence . Polymer length ap - pears to be of little importance , given the broad ranges capable of restoring appressorium development . To investigate how exogenous chitosan was able to restore appressorium development in the cda mutants , (cid:13)uorescently labelled chitosan was used . FITC - chitosan was synthe - sized according to Qaqish et al ( Qaqish and Amiji , 1999 ) , and added to conidia of the WT and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strains germinating on an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surface . After a 16hr incubation , the FITC - chitosan was removed by washing , and the germlings imaged on a confocal microscope . The FITC - chitosan was able to restore appressorium forma - tion in cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 , and showed clear localization to the cell wall of germ tubes and appressoria ( Figure 3 . 9 ) . In the WT strain , weak (cid:13)uorescence was occasionally observed Figure 3 . 8 ( following page ) : Exogenous chitosan can restore appressorium de - velopment in the CDA deletion strains . A ) Rescue of appressorium formation in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 deletion strain with exogenously supplied chitosan ( 0 . 01 % ) . Pictures were taken at 8 hpi , scale bars : 20 m m . B ) Comparison of appressorium formation in WT ( white bars ) and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 deletion strain ( grey bars ) in the presence of di(cid:11)erent derivatives and formulations of chitosan ( shown in C ) . Conidia were germinated on an arti(cid:12)cial inductive surface for 8 hr in the presence of di(cid:11)erent types of chitosan at a (cid:12)nal concentration of 0 . 01 % or 0 . 001 % , after which appressorium formation was scored . Error bars show SD , n = 3 . DDA : degree of deacetylation . 89 90 in the germ tubes . Exogenous chitosan is therefore incorporated into the cell wall of the deletion strains . In a previous experiment , chitosan was observed to localize to the germ tube prior to appressorium development ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . To determine whether germ tube - localized chitosan was su(cid:14)cient to induce appressorium development , FITC - chitosan was added to germinating conidia of the WT or cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strains for just 2 hr , before be - ing washed o(cid:11) , and the germlings incubated for a further 16 hr . In this way , chitosan was only present during the initial germ tube stage of germling morphogenesis , and was removed before appressorium development occurred . Surprisingly , appressorium devel - opment was restored in the deletion strain by this short incubation with FITC - chitosan . In this case , (cid:13)uorescence was only observed in the germ tube , and not the appressoria of cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings , with similar localization in the WT ( Figure 3 . 9B ) . Lastly , to investigate whether chitosan could restore appressorium development at later stages of germling morphogenesis , conidia were incubated for 16hr on an arti(cid:12)cial surface , then FITC - chitosan added , and the conidia incubated for a further 8hr . Again , appressorium development was restored in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain , although of course the germ tubes were highly - elongated in this case ( Figure 3 . 9C ) . Fluorescence was ob - served along the entire length of these elongated germ tubes , although appeared to be more intense at regions proximal to the point of emergence from the conidium . In this case , WT germlings also exhibited (cid:13)uorescence in both germ tubes and appressoria , con - trary to previous observations from the (cid:12)rst experiment . The incorporation of chitosan into the cell walls of cda mutants was a curious phe - nomenon . As described previously , carboxymethylchitosan , in which an anionic carboxy group is introduced onto the normally cationic chitosan , was unable to restore appresso - rium development . Thus , charge appears to be a critical factor in the rescue of appresso - rium development by exogenous chitosan . This led to the hypothesis that an electrostatic interaction between the polycationic chitosan , and an anionic component of the cell wall may be responsible for chitosan incorporation . However , little is known of anionic cell wall components , although a number of previous studies have detected uronic acids as a component of the fungal cell wall , in Botrytis cinerea ( Cantu et al . , 2009 ) , Rhizopus oryzae ( M(cid:19)elida et al . , 2015 ) and a number of Fusarium species ( Scho(cid:11)elmeer et al . , 1999 ) . 91 Figure 3 . 9 : Exogenous chitosan is incorporated into the cell wall of CDA deletion strains . A ) Rescue of appressorium development in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 deletion strain using exogenous , (cid:13)uorescently labelled chitosan following a 16hr incubation , showing clear localization to the cell wall of the germ tube and appressorium ( single z - section inset ) . B ) Rescue of appressorium development after a 2hr incubation with FITC - chitosan , followed by washing and a further 16hr incubation , showing germtube - localized FITC - chitosan . C ) Rescue of appressorium development after addition of FITC - chitosan at 16 hpi , and incubation for a further 8 hr . Note : Picture brightness and contrast have been increased in B and C to improve clarity upon printing . 92 As discussed previously , OGA488 , a (cid:13)uorescently labelled oligomer of galacturonic acid is able to act as a highly - speci(cid:12)c probe for chitosan , due to a speci(cid:12)c electrostatic interac - tion . However , the inverse of this is also true : (cid:13)uorescently labelled oligomers of chitosan ( named COS488 ) can act as a highly speci(cid:12)c probe for poly - b 1 , 4 - galacturonic acid ( PGA ) ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) . To test whether PGA is a component of the M . oryzae cell wall , vegetative hyphae and germlings were labelled with COS488 . Only weak (cid:13)uorescence was observed in hyphae stained with COS488 , with some internalization of the probe evident ( Figure 3 . 10B ) . Stronger (cid:13)uorescence was observed in the cell walls of appresso - ria and germ tubes in the WT germlings , and on the elongated germ tubes of the triple deletion strain ( Figure 3 . 10 ) . Staining of the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings was similar to that observed with the incorporation of FITC - chitosan at 16 hpi ( Figure 3 . 9C ) , in that (cid:13)uorescence was stronger at parts of the germ tube proximal to the point of emergence from the conidium . In order to independently verify this data , attempts were made to stain germlings with the anti - pectin antibodies JIM5 , JIM7 and LM19 ( a generous gift from Ian Moore , University of Oxford ) . These antibodies all recognize epitopes contain - ing polygalacturonic acid , although with some dependancy upon degrees and patterns of methyl - esteri(cid:12)cation ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) . However , no staining of WT germlings was observed with any of these antibodies ( not shown ) . In a separate experiment , germlings were treated with a pectinase enzyme cocktail , which included polygalacturonase . WT and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings at 16 hpi were treated with 12 . 5 units of the enzyme cock - tail for 5 hr , then washed and stained with COS488 . However , no consistent reduction in labelling was observed in the WT germlings ( not shown ) . Intriguingly however , treat - ment of cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings with the pectinase cocktail led to complete failure of the germlings to adhere to the hydrophobic glass surface , which prevented successful staining . Pathogenicity is una(cid:11)ected in the CDA deletion strains Appressorium development is highly defective on arti(cid:12)cial surfaces in cda mutants . It was therefore expected that pathogenicity would be reduced in these strains . To determine whether this was the case , equal concentrations of conidia of the deletion strains were inoculated onto rice leaves . As reported previously for cbp1 ( Kamakura et al . , 2002 ) and 93 Figure 3 . 10 : Polygalacturonic acid may be a component of the cell wall in M . oryzae . A ) Labelling of WT and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings at 16 hpi with the COS488 probe , which has been used to localize polygalacturonic acid ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) . B ) Staining of WT mycelium with COS488 , showing weak labelling of hyphae , and internalization of probe . Scale bars : 20 m m . 94 cda3 ( Saitoh et al . , 2012 ) , and as expected for cda2 , pathogenicity was una(cid:11)ected ( not shown ) . Surprisingly however , the double and triple deletion strains were also able to successfully infect rice leaves , causing similar lesion numbers to the WT strain ( Figure 3 . 11 ) . Previously , appressorium development was found to be restored in the cbp1 strain on rice leaves ( Kamakura et al . , 2002 ) . To see if this was also the case in the other deletion strains , rice leaf sheaths were inoculated with conidia of the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain , and incubated for 24 hr . This revealed that appressorium development was indeed restored upon germination on a leaf surface . Not only this , but the appressoria of cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 were able to penetrate rice cells with similar e(cid:14)ciency to the WT : 67 % ( (cid:6) 7 ( SD ) , n = 3 ) of WT appressoria had invasive hyphae at 24 hpi , compared with 47 % ( (cid:6) 10 ( SD ) , n = 3 ) of cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 . To see if this e(cid:11)ect was speci(cid:12)c to the rice leaf surface , the experiment was repeated on onion epidermis . Again , appressorium development was restored in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain ; conidia produced short germ tubes , and functional appressoria ( as evidenced by visible invasive hyphae at 24 hpi ) ( Figure 3 . 11 ) . One factor that is present on leaves , but not arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surfaces are the cuticular waxes . To test whether wax was su(cid:14)cient to restore appressorium develop - ment in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain , hydrophobic glass coverslips were coated with the wax molecule 1 - octacosanol , which has previously been used to induce appressorium development in M . oryzae ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . Conidia of cda2 / cbp1 ( not shown ) and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germinated on this surface for 24 hr did form appressoria , but germ tubes remained extremely elongated , unlike on onion epidermis or rice leaves ( Figure 3 . 11 ) . Unfortunately , accurate quanti(cid:12)cation of appressorium development on this sur - face was challenging using bright(cid:12)eld microscopy , as the opacity of the wax crystals prevented clear visualization of germlings .

Pathogenic development was fully restored in the CDA deletion strains on plant surfaces and partially restored by the presence of wax molecules ( white arrow heads show appressoria ) . Scale bars : 20 m m . 95 96 Chitosan is not required for appressorium development on plant surfaces The rescue of appressorium development on plant surfaces was a perplexing result . It was hypothesized that chemical factors present on the leaf surface ( e . g . wax , cutin ) could cause upregulation of additional chitin deacetylases , which are functionally redundant and can therefore restore chitin deacetylation . To test this , conidia of the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 and WT strains were germinated on rice leaf sheaths or onion epidermis , then stained with the chitosan - speci(cid:12)c probe OGA488 . This revealed that chitosan remained completely absent in the triple deletion strain , whilst strong labelling of germ tubes and appressoria was observed in the WT ( Figure 3 . 12 ) . This again suggests that chitosan is not an absolute requirement for appressorium development ; instead , this requirement appears to be surface dependant . The appressoria of M . oryzae contain an impermeable melanin layer in their cell wall . To test whether the melanin was preventing detection of chitosan in the appressoria of cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 , two approaches were taken . The (cid:12)rst involved staining germlings for chi - tosan at 4 hpi , prior to melanization of the appressoria . However , staining with OGA488 remained completely absent in unmelanized cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings , suggesting the melanin was not preventing the detection of chitosan ( Figure 3 . 12B ) . The second ap - proach was to germinate conidia in the presence of tricyclazole , an inhibitor of melanin biosynthesis , prior to staining for chitosan with OGA488 . Unexpectedly , a dramatic re - duction in OGA488 labelling was observed in tricyclazole treated germlings of the WT strain . This was true of germlings developed on both onion epidermis ( not shown ) and on an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surface ( Figure 3 . 12C ) . Chemical inducers can restore appressorium development in CDA deletion strains Appressorium development in M . oryzae is controlled by a number of regulatory pathways , which respond to the physical and chemical cues present on the leaf surface . Previously , it was shown that appressorium development in cbp1 could be restored by the addi - tion of chemical activators of these pathways , such as cAMP , 1 , 16 hexadecanediol ( cutin monomer ) or diacylglycerol ( Kamakura et al . , 2002 ) . To investigate whether this is also the case in the other deletion strains , conidia were germinated on a hydrophobic glass 97 Figure 3 . 12 : Restored pathogenic development on plant surfaces is not accompanied by restored chitin deacetylation . Fluorescent labelling of chitosan with OGA488 in WT and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings germinated on A ) rice leaf sheaths or onion epidermis for 24 hr , showing complete absence of chitosan in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain .

Scale bars : as stated in pictures 98 surface in the presence of 2 . 5 mM IBMX ( a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases intracellular levels of cAMP ) , 200 m M 1 , 16 hexadecanediol ( HDD , a cutin monomer ) or 58 m M diacylglycerol ( DAG , an activator of protein kinase C ) . Consistent with the previ - ous report , all of the treatments could restore appressorium development in cbp1 ( Figure 3 . 13 ) . Although the proportion of germ tubes forming appressoria was unchanged in this case ( since observations were made at 16 hpi ) , germling morphology of cbp1 was now sim - ilar to WT , as evidenced by a reduction in germ tube lengths ( Figure 3 . 13 ) . cbp1 / cda3 showed similar sensitivity to the chemical inducers as cbp1 , although the proportion of germ tubes forming appressoria in the control treatment was slightly lower . Intriguingly however , cda2 / cbp1 was far less susceptible to all of the chemical inducers : neither HDD or DAG could restore appressorium development in this strain , and IBMX could only cause a partial rescue . The same was true in cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 , except that IBMX was even less e(cid:11)ective in this strain , with only a small proportion of germ tubes forming aberrant appressoria by 16 hpi . Rescue of cbp1 by HDD and DAG is therefore dependant upon CDA2 , and rescue by IBMX is dependant upon both CDA2 and CDA3 . In order to further characterize the response of the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 mutant to chem - ical inducers , the above experiment was repeated , except observations were made at 24 hpi , and germinations were performed on both hydrophobic and hydrophilic glass sur - faces . At 24 hpi on the hydrophobic surface , the response of cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings to the inducers was much the same as at 16 hpi , although the proportion of appresso - ria formed with IBMX was higher ( Figure 3 . 14A ) . As with the appressoria formed on a plant surface , it was important to determine whether this rescue could be explained by restored chitin deacetylation . IBMX - treated germlings of the WT and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strains were stained with OGA488 at 24 hpi . This revealed that chitosan was indeed present on the germ tubes and appressoria of the triple deletion strain , albeit to a much lesser extent than the WT germlings ( Figure 3 . 14B ) . This suggests that rescue by IBMX is simply due to upregulation of redundant chitin deacetylases , as observed in cbp1 , rather than the activation of an otherwise inactive signalling pathway . Hydrophobicity is one of the key physical cues inducing appressorium development , and is perceived in a cAMP - dependant manner ( Lee and Dean , 1993 ) . In order to further examine the relationship between hydrophobic surface sensing , chitosan and the chemical 99 Figure 3 . 13 : The CDA deletion strains show distinct sensitivity to chemical inducers of appressorium development .

ND = Not Determined . 100 inducers , germinations were repeated on a hydrophilic glass surface . As expected , no appressorium development was observed in the WT strain after a 24hr incubation , but could be restored by the addition of IBMX or HDD . However , these inducers remained in - e(cid:11)ective on cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 ( Figure 3 . 14C ) . As discussed previously , exogenous chitosan can fully restore appressorium development in the CDA deletion strains on a hydrophobic surface . To see if this was also true on a hydrophilic surface , conidia were germinated in the presence of 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) chitosan for 24 hr . However , no appressoria were formed in the WT or cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strains . Next , combined treatments of chitosan and IBMX or HDD were applied . Interestingly , these combined treatments were able to induce ap - pressorium development in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 mutant . This experiment revealed two important facts : i ) chitosan acts independently of surface hydrophobicity , and ii ) chi - tosan acts through a separate pathway to IBMX or HDD . An additional experiment was also performed , in which IBMX and HDD were added in combination . However , this did not induce appressorium development in the triple deletion strain ( not shown ) . In a recent study , rapamycin was found to induce of appressorium development in a Pmk1 dependant manner ( Marroquin - Guzman and Wilson , 2015 ) . To test whether rapamycin could induce appressorium development in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain , 55nM rapamycin was added either alone , or in combination with chitosan , IBMX or HDD , to conidia ger - minating on hydrophilic glass . Unfortunately , the (cid:12)ndings of this study could not be reproduced ; rapamycin did not induce appressorium development in either the WT or triple deletion strain ( not shown ) . Chitosan is required for germling adhesion During the course of this study , it was observed that the germlings of CDA deletion strains were more easily washed o(cid:11) arti(cid:12)cial surfaces . To investigate this further , adhesion of WT and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings was quanti(cid:12)ed on both hydrophilic and hydrophobic glass surfaces at 2 hpi . As expected , germlings of the triple deletion strain demonstrated much lower adhesion than the WT , on both surfaces ( Figure 3 . 15 ) . This loss of adhesion could not be explained by lower conidial germination in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain ; 95 % ( (cid:6) 2 , ( SD ) n = 3 ) of WT conidia had germinated by 2 hpi , compared with 98 % ( (cid:6) 1 , ( SD ) n = 3 ) in cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 . Remarkably , adhesion could be fully restored by germinating 101 Figure 3 . 14 : Combinations of chemical inducers are required to restore appres - sorium development in cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 .

Appressorium formation could be partially restored in the triple deletion strain ( grey bars ) after a 24hr incubation with IBMX , although chitosan staining of these germlings ( B ) showed that the appressorium formation was associated with an increase in chitosan in the germlings of the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 mutant , suggesting upregulation of functionally redundant chitin deacetylases . C ) Appressorium development on hydrophilic surfaces could be restored to levels similar to the WT strain by combinations of 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) chitosan and 2 . 5 mM IBMX or 200 m M 1 , 16 hex - adecanediol ( HDD ) .

Two independent cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 lines were used which gave identical results , although only one of these is shown . 102 the conidia in the presence of 0 . 01 % chitosan . The adhesion of fungal cells to surfaces such as glass or plastic is often mediated by cell wall glycoproteins . A commonly used method for the detection of such glycoproteins is staining with the (cid:13)uorescently - labelled mannose - binding lectin Concanavalin A ( FITC - ConA ) . Staining of WT or cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings at 2 hpi with FITC - ConA revealed strong (cid:13)uorescence of the germ tube in WT germlings , but only weak (cid:13)uorescence in the deletion strain ( Figure 3 . 15 ) . Ectopic expression of CBP1 : mCherry One of the original hypotheses regarding the role of chitin deacetylation was in reduc - ing cell wall rigidity . In an attempt to investigate this hypothesis , CBP1 : mCherry was ectopically expressed by the ribosomal protein promoter RP27 , in the WT background strain . The RP27 promoter has previously been used in M . oryzae to give strong , con - stitutive expression of genes ( Samalova et al . , 2014 ) . pRP27 and CBP1 were ampli(cid:12)ed with primer pairs 70 / 75 and 76 / 48 respectively , then joined by fusion PCR ( Primers 70 and 48 ) . The pRP27 : CBP1 fusion was cloned into the pUCAP plasmid at the Asc I site ( Appendix D ) , creating a C - terminal mCherry fusion . Following transformation , several independent lines ectopically expressing CBP1 : mCherry ( Appendix F ) were characterized during vegetative growth and pathogenic development . During mycelial growth , (cid:13)uorescence was absent in growing hyphae at the colony margins , but in mature hyphae strong (cid:13)uorescence localized to the hyphal septa , with weaker (cid:13)uorescence at the lateral walls ( Figure 3 . 16 ) . In germlings , (cid:13)uorescence was pri - marily observed in walls of germ tubes and appressoria , but occasionally also to conidia , typically the apical compartment . Additionally , intracellular ( most likely vacuolar ) (cid:13)u - orescence was also observed in the appressoria . During in planta growth , the cell walls of invasive hyphae also showed strong (cid:13)uorescence . In all cases however , growth and cellular morphology appeared to be una(cid:11)ected by ectopic expression of Cbp1 : mCherry . Colonies ectopically expressing Cbp1 : mCherry looked identical to the WT , and hyphae showed no signs of cell bursting or bulging . Similarly , conidia formed appressoria with similar morphology to WT , and were able to penetrate rice cells and form invasive hyphae ( Figure 3 . 16 ) . 103 Figure 3 . 15 : Germling adhesion is reduced in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain .

Since chitosan was shown to be absent in the germ tubes and appressoria of cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 germlings developed on plant surfaces , this provided a perfect opportunity to test this hypothesis . Conidia of both the WT and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain were inoculated onto onion epidermis and incubated for 16hr , after which 0 . 4 mg / ml chitinase or 0 . 4 mg / ml BSA ( as a negative control ) were added , and samples were incubated for a further 8 hr . Microscopic observation revealed that the chitinase treatment had little e(cid:11)ect on either strain ; conidia , germ tubes and appressoria appeared to be intact despite the treatment . However , further experimentation is required to con(cid:12)rm these (cid:12)ndings , in particular the staining of chitin after chitinase treatment .

Scale bars : 20 m m . 106 3 . 3 Discussion Appressorium development is regulated by two key pathways in M . oryzae . The Pmk1 pathway appears to operate at the earliest stage of appressorium development , and is required for sensing of wax , and possibly of surface attachment . The second , the cAMP pathway , is hypothesized to operate at the commitment phase of appressorial develop - ment , and is required for sensing of hydrophobicity and cutin monomers ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . Considerable cross - talk exists between these two pathways , but activation of both is required for appressorium development . Many previous studies have been devoted to characterizing the proteins operating in these pathways . Signi(cid:12)cantly , deletion of the genes encoding these proteins results in phenotypes that are similar to those reported for the CDA deletion strains . Considering the data from this study in the context of previous data on signal perception in M . oryzae allows the role played by chitosan to be elucidated . When germinated on an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surface , conidia of the CDA deletion strains cbp1 , cda2 / cbp1 and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 failed to undergo early di(cid:11)erentiation events , and appressorium development was either severely delayed ( in cbp1 ) or rarely occurred at all ( in cda2 / cbp1 and cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 ) . Failure to di(cid:11)erentiate appressoria on arti(cid:12)cial surfaces is a phenotype shared by a number of other deletion strains with putative roles in surface sensing . For example , deletion strains of the signaling mucin Msb2 produce a phenotype with a striking resemblance to that reported in the present study : conidia of the msb2 mutant germinated on an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surface produce highly elon - gated , undi(cid:11)erentiated germ tubes ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . However , when inoculated onto a plant surface appressorium development was fully restored , just as in the cda strains . In addition , cutin monomers were also unable to rescue msb2 , although the e(cid:11)ect of cAMP was not determined . These similarities may suggest a functional link between Msb2 and chitosan . Msb2 has a single transmembrane domain which anchors the protein to the plasma membrane , whilst the extracellular portion of the protein resides within the cell wall . It was recently shown that this extracellular portion alone could partially sup - press the defects associated with MSB2 deletion ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . It could therefore be the case that chitosan is required for cell wall - localization of Msb2 ; the absence of chitosan may result in loss of Msb2 from the cell wall , resulting in the observed pheno - type . Unfortunately , the precise mechanism by which Msb2 mediates surface sensing is 107 unknown , which limits speculation on the putative functional link between this protein and chitosan . However , in a recent study , combined deletion of CBP1 and MSB2 had additive e(cid:11)ects ; virulence and Pmk1 phosphorylation ( in vegetative hyphae ) were shown to be more reduced in msb2 / cbp1 strains than in msb2 strains ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . Loss of chitosan may therefore a(cid:11)ect multiple surface - sensing related processes at the earliest stage of germling morphogenesis , which converge on the Pmk1 pathway . In support of this hypothesis , cbp1 germlings have also been shown to be unable to form hyphopodia on arti(cid:12)cial hydrophilic surfaces , a phenotype shared by the pmk1 mutant , but not the cpka mutant ( Tucker et al . , 2010 ) . In an attempt to demonstrate a link between chitosan and Pmk1 activation , a dominant active allele of the Pmk1 activating MEK kinase Mst7 was transformed into the cda2 / cbp1 strain . However , the resulting transformants failed to demonstrate restored appressorium development , although further investigations were not performed to determine whether or not this was due to a faulty construct . Other proteins with putative roles in surface sensing are the hydrophobin Mpg1 ( Tal - bot et al . , 1993 , 1996 ) , and the putative G - protein coupled receptor Pth11 ( DeZwaan et al . , 1999 ) . The mpg1 and pth11 mutants demonstrate very similar defects in appresso - rium development : Conidia produce elongated germ tubes on hydrophobic surfaces , and fail to develop appressoria as in the cda mutants . There are , however , several important di(cid:11)erences in the phenotypes : Firstly , appressorium development is also defective on plant surfaces in mpg1 and pth11 . Secondly , germ tubes of mpg1 and pth11 do undergo early di(cid:11)erentiation events ( germ tube hooking ) . Thirdly , cAMP can restore appressorium de - velopment in both mpg1 and pth11 ( Talbot et al . , 1996 ) , but not in the cda mutants , although this is complicated by the presence of redundant CDA s that are upregulated by cAMP ( see ‘regulation of chitin deacetylases’ ) . This suggests that Mpg1 and Pth11 act upstream of the cAMP pathway , whereas chitosan does not . This hypothesis is sup - ported by the fact that chitosan and IBMX / cutin had synergistic e(cid:11)ects on appressorium development on a hydrophilic surface . Yet , it is also possible that both the Pmk1 and cAMP pathways rely on the presence of chitosan , in which case the activation of just one of these by chemical or genetic means would be insu(cid:14)cient to restore appressorium development . The fact that germination in the presence of 1 - octacosanol , which acts upstream of the Pmk1 pathway ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) , 108 could only partially restore appressorium development in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain , supports this scenario . Assuming that activation of both the Pmk1 and cAMP path - ways is indeed defective , how might chitosan be required for the activation of the cAMP pathway ? One mechanism could relate to the interaction between Mpg1 and the cell wall . Hydrophobins form amphipathic monolayers at the interface between hydrophobic - hydrophilic surfaces . Since leaf surfaces are highly hydrophobic , this presumably results in the assembly of an Mpg1 layer between the leaf surface and the cell wall of the germ tube . Loss of chitosan from the cell wall could alter the interaction between the germ tube cell wall and Mpg1 , preventing hydrophobic surface sensing . Intriguingly , cell wall components such as b 1 , 3 - glucan have previously been found to promote rodlet formation of the class I hydrophobin Sc3 from Schizophyllum commune at hydrophobic interfaces ( Scholtmeijer et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , the structure of hydrophobins such as EAS from N . crassa also provides some support for a putative interaction between Mpg1 and chi - tosan . EAS has both a hydrophobic area which presumably interacts with hydrophobic surfaces , and a negatively charged area on the opposite side of the protein , which may interact with the cell wall in a charge - dependant manner ( Kwan et al . , 2006 ) . Although the structure of Mpg1 has not been solved , the fact that expression of EAS in the mpg1 mutant can restore the WT phenotype ( Kershaw et al . , 1998 ) suggests the conservation of structure and function of these proteins . Unfortunately , our current lack of understand - ing of exactly how Mpg1 promotes appressorium development in response to hydrophobic surfaces prevents further speculation on this matter . A second mechanism by which chi - tosan may be required for activation of the cAMP pathway could be via its e(cid:11)ects on the physical properties of the cell wall . In the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus , adhesion - force sensing was found to be dependant upon peptidoglycan cross - linking , which governs the deformability of the cell wall in response to mechanical stimuli ( Harapanahalli et al . , 2015 ) . The deacetylation of chitin could have an analogous role in the germlings of M . oryzae : Chitosan may alter the properties of the cell wall in order to render it capa - ble of transmitting the force of the surface adhesion to sensor proteins . The G - protein coupled receptor Pth11 could be such a sensor protein . Localized to the plasma mem - brane , mechanical stimulation resulting from cell adhesion to a hard surface may result in membrane perturbations , leading to conformational changes in the protein and activation 109 ( Kumamoto , 2008 ) . Mechanical stress has previously been shown to induce conforma - tional changes in GPCRs such as the Angiotensin II type - 1 receptor and B2 - Bradykinin receptor ( Yasuda et al . , 2008 ; Chachisvilis et al . , 2006 ) , although no such investigations have yet been made in Pth11 . Mechanosensitive ( MS ) ion channels are another possible group of sensor proteins which may mediate surface sensing in response to cell wall and membrane deformation in germlings . Such channels open in response to physical stimuli that a(cid:11)ect the plasma membrane . As such , they have been found to be responsible for the sensing of physical stimuli in the bean rust fungus Uromyces appendiculatus ( Zhou et al . , 1991 ) and in C . albicans ( Brand et al . , 2007 ) . However , the roles of these channels have not yet been characterized in M . oryzae , and it is unclear how the activation of these would in(cid:13)uence the pathways regulating appressorium development . An alternative explanation , although one that is not mutually exclusive with those proposed above , is that the phenotypes observed in the cda deletion strains arise from a lack of germling adhesion . Germlings of cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 were much more easily detached than those of the WT , even under the relatively gentle washing conditions employed in the experiment . This suggests that the adhesive properties of the germ tube are defective in the absence of chitosan . In this scenario , germ - tube localized chitosan is not required for transmitting the force of the adhesion ( as described above ) , but is required for the adhesion of the germ tube to the surface itself , and is therefore required for surface sensing . Thus , chitosan may act directly as a polysaccharide ‘glue’ , or is required for the attachment of various adhesin - like proteins to the cell wall ( or a combination of both ) . Lack of chitosan in cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 did result in a reduction of Concanavalin A staining , suggesting a reduction of mannan in the cell wall , but there are several possible explanations for this : i ) chitosan is required for attachment of mannoproteins to the cell wall , ii ) overall cell wall structure is altered by the loss of chitosan , including a reduction in non - protein associated mannan , iii ) mannoproteins are produced , but secretion to the outer wall is a(cid:11)ected by loss of chitosan or , iv ) lack of surface sensing and activation of Pmk1 and / or cAMP pathways means that production of the mannoproteins does not occur in the (cid:12)rst place , i . e . reduced germling adhesion is a consequence , and not the cause of defective surface sensing . Further investigations are required to distinguish between these possibilities . 110 Germling attachment and surface sensing are critical stages of pathogenic develop - ment in a number of fungi , including Ustilago maydis ( Mendoza - Mendoza et al . , 2009 ) , Botrytis cinerea ( Doehlemann et al . , 2006 ) and Colletotrichum graminicola ( Chaky et al . , 2001 ) . It would therefore be of interest to determine whether chitosan is also required for surface sensing in these species . Whilst the characterization of chitin deacetylases has not yet been performed in plant pathogenic species other than M . oryzae , transcrip - tomics data does suggest the involvement of these enzymes in pathogenic development . In B . cinerea for example , the chitin deacetylases CDA1 and CDA3 demonstrated upreg - ulation in the early stages of spore germination ( Leroch et al . , 2013 ) . Similarly , several chitin deacetylases in U . maydis are induced during germination on a hydrophobic surface ( Lanver et al . , 2014 ) . Model for the role of chitosan in appressorium development The role of chitosan in appressorium development is an intriguing one , and there remain many unanswered questions , as discussed above . Despite this , the following model ( Figure 3 . 18 ) is consistent with all of the data presented in this study , and with data from previous studies characterizing surface sensing proteins in M . oryzae . In this model , germ - tube localized chitosan is required for the activation of the Pmk1 MAP kinase pathway in response to a surface , but independently of surface hydrophobicity . Activation of the cAMP pathway may also require chitosan , but it is not possible to conclusively determine whether just one or both of the signalling pathways are defective in cda mutants from the current data . Chitosan - mediated activation of these pathways may be due to : (cid:15) A direct interaction between the chitosan and cell wall - associated proteins involved in surface sensing e . g . Msb2 or Mpg1 , where chitosan is required for the correct localization or conformation of the protein . (cid:15) Chitosan imparting particular physical properties ( e . g (cid:13)exibility ) to the cell wall , which is required for transmitting the force of surface adhesion to membrane - localized sensors . (cid:15) Germ tube adhesion , which is either directly mediated by chitosan , or due to gly - coproteins which are dependant upon chitosan for wall localization . 111 Clearly , none of the above hypotheses are mutually exclusive , and it is possible that chitosan is required for a number of processes relating to surface sensing . Various chemical inducers are able to by - pass the requirement for certain stimuli . cAMP and cutin monomers ( e . g . 1 , 16 hexadecanediol ) both activate the cAMP pathway , and can induce appressorium development in WT germlings in the absence of hydropho - bicity . However , neither can compensate for the absence of chitosan in cda mutants . This is either because the cAMP pathway operates normally in cda mutants , or because both the Pmk1 and cAMP pathways are defective , and activation of both is required for appressorium development . Chemical stimuli present on leaf surfaces are able to activate both pathways simultaneously , leading to normal appressorium development in the ab - sence of chitosan : Wax is perceived by Sho1 and Msb2 , which activate Pmk1 ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) , and cutin activates the cAMP pathway through Pth11 ( DeZwaan et al . , 1999 ) . There are also likely to be additional factors which have yet to be discovered . Evidence for additional roles of chitosan The deacetylation of chitin was hypothesized to cause profound changes to the chemical and physical properties of the cell wall , which could be crucial for cellular morphogene - sis . However , no evidence for this has been found in the present study . Germlings of the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain developed appressoria that were morphologically indistinguishable from the WT strain on plant surfaces despite the absence of detectable chitosan . Addi - tionally , appressorium development in cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 was restored by a short incubation with FITC - chitosan that was only incorporated into the germ tube , although admittedly , subsequent chitosan staining of germlings was not performed in this experiment . Not only was chitosan not required for morphogenesis of appressoria , but appressorium func - tion also seemed to be una(cid:11)ected by the absence of chitosan , since plant penetration continued to be achieved successfully . Chitosan is therefore unlikely to be a key struc - tural component of the cell wall , in contrast to Cryptococcus neoformans where loss of chitosan impaired cellular integrity ( Baker et al . , 2007 ) . On the other hand , it is also possible that compensatory changes in cell wall composition occurred in the absence of chitosan , which were not investigated . The upregulation of other cell wall components may be su(cid:14)cient to maintain cell wall integrity in the cda mutants . In a similar vein , it is 112 Figure 3 . 18 : Model describing the role of chitosan in appressorium development . Germling development on three di(cid:11)erent surfaces is shown ( hydrophilic , hydrophobic and leaf ) , with observed phenotypes shown inset . Successful appressorium development is dependant upon activation of both the Pmk1 and cAMP pathways . The absence of chitosan prevents complete activation of the Pmk1 pathway and possibly the cAMP pathway . The addition of exogenous chitosan and / or chemical inducers of these pathways can fully restore appressorium development in the CDA deletion strains . Thus , germ tube localized chitosan likely acts upstream of both the Pmk1 and cAMP pathways to induce appressorium development . 113 not inconceivable that compensatory changes were also responsible for allowing appresso - rium morphogenesis to occur in the absence of chitosan . This is perhaps less likely since cellular morphogenesis requires a very speci(cid:12)c and highly regulated interplay between synthesis of cell wall components and cellular growth . In a separate attempt to discover the consequences of chitin deacetylation on the properties of the cell wall , Cbp1 : mCherry was ectopically expressed . Unfortunately , this failed to reveal any morphological conse - quences of deregulated chitin deacetylation . It should be noted that chitosan staining was not performed in the pRP27 : CBP1mCherry strains , although Cbp1 : mCherry is known to be functional as it successfully complemented the deletion strain . A second hypothesized role of chitosan is in the protection from plant chitinases . Since this did not transpire to be the primary focus of this study , there is currently insu(cid:14)cient evidence to conclusively con(cid:12)rm or refute this hypothesis . Nevertheless , the preliminary (cid:12)ndings presented here , together with evidence from previous studies do not fully support this role for chitosan . Germlings of cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 in which chitosan was absent remained intact on leaf surfaces , in contrast to those of the ags mutant which lack a 1 , 3 - glucan and were destroyed , presumably by degradative enzymes on the leaf surface ( Fujikawa et al . , 2012 ) . Even the addition of exogenous chitinase was apparently insu(cid:14)cient to cause noticeable loss of cellular integrity , although further experimentation is required to fully characterize the e(cid:11)ect of chitinase treatment on the cda mutants . Taken together , these data suggest that a 1 , 3 - glucan may be the cell wall component with the protective role in M . oryzae germlings . Upon re(cid:13)ection , it would perhaps have been more valuable to investigate the hypothesized protective e(cid:11)ects of chitin deacetylation during in planta growth . Chitosan staining was not performed on invasive hyphae in the cda mutants , although the lack of any in planta (cid:13)uorescence in the mCherry tagged CDA strains suggests that the chitin deacetylases operating during appressorium development may not also expressed during invasive growth . Regulation of chitin deacetylases The three CDA genes characterized in this study have redundant roles in chitin deacety - lation during appressorium development . Yet it is also clear that their regulation di(cid:11)ers considerably , such that the redundancy is only apparent under certain conditions . The 114 rescue of appressorium development in cbp1 had been previously demonstrated by the addition of chemical inducers such as IBMX , 1 , 16 hexadecanediol or diacylglycerol ( Ka - makura et al . , 2002 ) . However , in this study it was shown that this rescue is dependant upon the other two CDA genes , CDA2 and CDA3 . Restored appressorium development in cbp1 is therefore likely due to the upregulation or activation of CDA2 and CDA3 due to activation of the cAMP , Pmk1 or cell wall integrity pathways by the chemical induc - ers . The regulation of these genes by the aforementioned pathways has been noted in previous studies : CDA2 and CDA3 were found to be upregulated by cAMP treatment ( Franck et al . , 2013 ; Irie et al . , 2003 ) and CDA2 was signi(cid:12)cantly downregulated in the pmk1 strain ( Soanes et al . , 2012 ) . Appressorium development could also be restored in the cda2 / cbp1 / cda3 strain by the addition of IBMX or by germination on plant surfaces . In the case of IBMX - treated germlings , restored chitosan staining was observed ( Figure 3 . 14 ) , suggesting the upregulation of yet another CDA . However , no staining was ob - served in germlings on plant surfaces , suggesting that in this case , rescue was not due to upregulation of redundant CDAs . In the absence of arti(cid:12)cial pathway activation , the temporal regulation of CBP1 and CDA2 appeared to be di(cid:11)erent ; Cbp1 : mCherry (cid:13)uorescence was observed at much earlier stages of germling morphogenesis than Cda2 : mCherry . Most intriguingly , Cbp1 : mCherry localized to the apical conidial cell wall even prior to harvesting of conidia ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . It could be speculated that the chitosan synthesized by Cbp1 at the earliest stage of conidial germination is required for activation of the Pmk1 and cAMP pathways , which in turn leads to upregulation of CDA2 and CDA3 . CDA2 and CDA3 may therefore be part of a positive feedback loop , leading to stable cellular di(cid:11)erentiation in response to surface signals . A (cid:12)nal aspect of the regulation of chitin deacetylation was discovered from the in - hibition of melanization . Germination of conidia in the presence of tricyclazole led to a dramatic decrease in detectable chitosan on both germ tubes and appressoria . This could indicate that melanization is a key step in cell wall biosynthesis ; lack of melanization may prevent down - stream activation of other cell wall enzymes either at a transcriptional or post - translational level . 115 Possible coordination between chitin synthesis and deacetylation In Cryptococcus neoformans , all chitin that is later deacetylated into chitosan is synthe - sized by a single chitin synthase , which suggested possible coordination between these enzymes ( Banks et al . , 2005 ) . Evidence from this study also supports this hypothesis . Deletion of CHS7 results in an almost identical phenotype to multiple CDA deletion ( Odenbach et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that Cbp1 , Cda2 and Cda3 may deacetylate the chitin synthesized by Chs7 . The colocalization of Cbp1 : mCherry and Cda2 : mCherry with Chs7 : 2xYFP provides some evidence for possible coordination , but also raises fur - ther questions . For example , colocalization was not observed to occur at the cell periphery in germ tubes : Chs7 localized to the tip , whereas Cbp1 localized to the lateral walls . Only during germ tube hooking and appressorium development was colocalization observed . This could be signi(cid:12)cant , because it may indicate that the timing of chitin deacetylation di(cid:11)ers according to developmental requirements . Chitin synthesized at the germ tube tip may have crystallized once it is part of the lateral walls , leading to a lower degree of deacetylation by Cbp1 . Conversely , in developing appressoria the colocalization of chitin synthases and chitin deacetylases may mean that chitin is deacetylated as soon as it is synthesized , and so is deacetylated to a greater extent . The timing of chitin deacetylation could therefore in(cid:13)uence the properties of chitosan , and possibly the cell wall as a whole . The speci(cid:12)city of the putative coordination between Chs7 and the chitin deacetylases cannot be determined from the current data . However , the fact that chs7 germlings can form appressoria on plant surfaces or in response to cAMP and 1 , 16 hexadecanediol treatment does o(cid:11)er some clues . Rescue of appressorium development in response to these treatments could be a result of upregulation of a partially redundant chitin synthases such as Chs1 , which is also required for normal appressorium development ( Kong et al . , 2012 ) . If this is indeed the case , it would be of interest to determine whether chitosan is also present , as it would suggest that the chitin deacetylases can deacetylate chitin from multiple chitin synthases . Chitin synthases are known to be cycled between the plasma membrane and intra - cellular bodies in S . cerevisiae ( Ziman et al . , 1996 ) . Whether this is also the case in M . oryzae is currently unknown , but the intracellular localization of Chs7 : 2xYFP sug - gests that this may be the case . Whilst some of the larger compartments observed were 116 almost undoubtedly vacuoles , the smaller (cid:13)uorescent punctae may represent endosomal or Golgi compartments acting as intracellular stores of Chs7 . Intriguingly , colocaliza - tion with Cbp1 : mCherry was observed in these intracellular compartments , which could suggest that these proteins are co - transported to and from the plasma membrane . If co - transportation does occur , then this , in turn , may suggest that a physical associa - tion exists between the chitin synthases and chitin deacetylases . Clearly , these questions require a great deal of further investigation . Polygalacturonic acid : a novel cell wall component in M . oryzae ? By using the probe COS488 , which was originally developed for localizing homogalac - turonan in plant tissue samples ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) , polygalacturonic acid ( PGA ) was tentatively identi(cid:12)ed as a novel component of the cell wall in the germlings of M . oryzae . The speci(cid:12)city of COS488 for PGA has been well - characterized : COS488 requires a de - gree of polymerization of at least 5 in the target PGA molecule in order to binding to occur , although binding increases with target length . No binding was found to oligomers of chitin or b 1 , 3 - glucose ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) . This suggests COS488 is highly - speci(cid:12)c for PGA . However , binding speci(cid:12)city was not evaluated on targets such as polyglucuronic acid , which are more similar in structure to PGA . Given that the target of COS488 in the cell walls of M . oryzae appeared not to be sensitive to polygalacturonase treatment , this could indicate that PGA is not the target . On the other hand , it may simply mean that the PGA was not accessible to the enzyme treatment , either due to its position in the cell wall , or its relationship with other cell wall components . The data showing rescue of appressorium development with exogenous chitosan ( Fig - ure 3 . 8 ) and its incorporation into the cell wall ( Figure 3 . 9 ) suggest an electrostatic interaction between chitosan and PGA . Chitosan and PGA may therefore form what is known as a polyelectrolyte complex ( PEC ) in the cell wall ( Dakhara et al . , 2010 ) . The formation of such a PEC would explain the relative e(cid:14)cacy of di(cid:11)erent types of chitosan in restoring appressorium development ( Figure 3 . 8 ) . The energetic favourability of the hypothesized interaction of chitosan with PGA obviously depends on the charge of the interacting molecules ; carboxymethylchitosan was unable to rescue appressorium develop - ment , presumably because it has anionic groups , which inhibit its association with PGA . 117 Similarly , the glycol moiety in glycol chitosan may have prevented stereochemical (cid:12)tting of the chitosan and PGA , reducing the stability of the complex . The role of molecular weight in this interaction is less intuitive , but the energetic favourability of an interaction between two polyelectrolytes increases with the length of the molecule ( Dakhara et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , short oligomers of chitosan would not form as stable complexes with the PGA as longer polymers , explaining the reduced e(cid:14)cacy of oligochitosan . The presence of PGA in the cell wall begs the question of how it is synthesized . Intrigu - ingly , and unlike most fungi , M . oryzae lacks a putative UDP - glucose - 6 - dehydrogenase , the enzyme required for the synthesis of UDP - glucuronic acid . UDP - glucuronic acid - 4 - epimerase , which catalyses the production of UDP - galacturonic acid is also absent in fungi . Therefore , any uronic acids in the cell wall of M . oryzae are likely to be synthesized by a non - conventional pathway , perhaps by in situ oxidation of galactose residues by secreted galactose oxidases . 3 . 4 Conclusions The investigation of chitin deacetylation during appressorium development has yielded unexpected and intriguing results . It appears that chitosan is required for surface sensing in germlings , although the mechanism behind this is unclear . The cell wall therefore plays a crucial role in the perception of physical stimuli in the germlings of M . oryzae , demonstrating a novel way in which the cell wall is crucial in acting as an interface between fungal cells and their environment . Evidence for additional roles of chitosan are incomplete ; further investigations are required to determine whether chitin deacetylation also plays a role as a ‘stealth’ mechanism in M . oryzae . In addition , no evidence was found for the hypothesized role of chitin deacetylation in cellular morphogenesis . In the following chapter , this hypothesis is further pursued by characterizing the role of chitin deacetylation during vegetative growth and development . 118 Chapter 4 Chitin deacetylation and vegetative growth 119 4 . 1 Objectives In the previous chapter , the role of chitin deacetylation during appressorium develop - ment was investigated . This revealed an unexpected role in surface sensing , but failed to con(cid:12)rm a role for chitosan in morphogenesis . In order to further investigate how chitin deacetylation may in(cid:13)uence cellular morphogenesis , this chapter describes the character - ization of CDAs and their role during vegetative growth . During vegetative growth , a number of changes in cell shape occur , for example during hyphal extension , hyphal branching or conidiation . Such changes may require localized increases in cell wall (cid:13)exibility brought about , at least in part , by chitin deacetylation . Currently , little is known regarding the role of chitosan during vegetative growth in (cid:12)lamentous fungi . In Ashbya gossypii , chitosan is a component of the spore cell wall , and deletion of the sole CDA present in the genome ( CDA1 ) resulted in almost complete loss of sporulation ( Lickfeld and Schmitz , 2012 ) . However , (cid:12)lamentous growth was una(cid:11)ected by CDA1 deletion , although the presence of chitosan as a hyphal wall component was not determined . In Neurospora crassa , chitosan was localized to hyphal septa , using the chitosan - speci(cid:12)c probe OGA488 ( Mravec et al . , 2014 ) , but chitin deacetylases have not yet been characterized in this fungus . Investigating the role of chitin deacetylation during vegetative growth in M . oryzae could therefore result in novel and valuable data . The objectives of this chapter are to : (cid:15) Determine whether chitosan is a component of the cell wall in vegetative hyphae and conidia (cid:15) Identify which chitin deacetylases ( if any ) are expressed during vegetative growth (cid:15) Perform targeted deletion of identi(cid:12)ed genes , in order to abolish chitin deacetylation (cid:15) Characterize vegetative growth in the deletion strains 120 4 . 2 Results Chitosan is a component of the cell wall in vegetative hyphae In germlings , chitosan could be readily localized with either anti - chitosan antibodies or the chitosan - speci(cid:12)c probe OGA488 . However , staining of hyphae proved to be more challenging . Firstly , the penetrability of the anti - chitosan antibody mAbG7 appeared to be too low for e(cid:11)ective labelling of hyphae grown in liquid medium , although weak labelling was observed ( Figure 4 . 1A ) . Secondly , in order to label hyphae grown on solid medium , hyphae were grown over a glass coverslip , which had previously been overlayed with complete medium . During extensive washing and labelling steps , the agar and hyphae were prone to dislodge from the coverslip , making staining with the antibody impossible . However , OGA488 is well - suited to staining these tissues ; its small molecular size means it has far superior penetrability compared with the antibody , and the rapid labelling means that samples remain intact during the protocol . Un(cid:12)xed hyphae , grown on both solid medium and in liquid medium , stained with OGA488 suggesting that chitosan is a component of the cell wall during vegetative growth . For hyphae grown on solid complete medium , (cid:13)uorescence was not observed in hyphae growing at the outermost edge of the colony , but was (cid:12)rst observed 1 . 5 - 2 mm from this point , and increased in intensity with increasing distance from the colony edge . Here , strong labelling of septa was observed , as well as weaker labelling of lateral walls and occasionally of hyphal tips ( Figure 4 . 1C ) . Unfortunately , the extreme hydrophobicity of hyphae grown on solid medium prevented labelling of all but the outer (cid:24) 5 mm of the colony , as washing bu(cid:11)er and OGA488 failed to penetrate beyond the surface hyphae . In an attempt to circumvent this problem , conidia were inoculated into liquid CM , incu - bated for 72 hr and the resulting mycelial pellets labelled with OGA488 . Again , strong (cid:13)uorescence was associated with the septa , with weaker (cid:13)uorescence of the lateral walls ( Figure 4 . 1B ) . Strikingly , only the outer edges of septa were labelled , resulting in a ‘ring’ of (cid:13)uorescence at each septum , although this may simply be a result of incomplete pen - etration of OGA488 into the inner regions of the septa . Unfortunately , the organization of hyphae was unclear upon microscopic observation of mycelial pellets ; it was di(cid:14)cult to know whether the hyphae being observed were from the growing edge of the pellet or 121 the older hyphae from the middle . As such , the spatial distribution of hyphae stained with OGA488 could not be directly compared between the two protocols . Chitosan is known to be a component of the cell wall in the spores of A . gossypii and S . cerevisiae . To determine whether this was also the case in the conidia of M . oryzae , staining was performed with both eosin Y and OGA488 . Whilst no staining was observed with OGA488 , consistent with the labelling of germlings in the previous chapter , weak (cid:13)uorescence was observed in the cell wall of conidia labelled with eosin Y ( Figure 4 . 1D ) . Given the superior speci(cid:12)city of OGA488 , these data suggest that chitosan is most - likely not a component of the conidial cell wall . Chitin deacetylases are highly expressed during mycelial growth Having established that chitin is deacetylated during hyphal growth , the next objective was to determine which chitin deacetylases were responsible . As determined in the previ - ous chapter , there are 10 putative chitin deacetylases present in the genome of M . oryzae ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . In order to (cid:12)nd which of these genes were expressed during vegetative growth , two transcriptional pro(cid:12)ling methods were used , as described in the previous chapter . Firstly , an existing transcriptomics dataset was exploited . As part of a study into transcriptional pro(cid:12)ling of appressorium development , Soanes et al . ( 2012 ) also per - formed a transcriptomic analysis of genes expressed in mycelium following growth of M . oryzae in liquid CM for 36 hr . By searching this dataset for all 10 CDA genes , the transcript abundance for these genes could be determined ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . This revealed that a single CDA ( CDA1 ) demonstrates extremely high transcript abundance under these growth conditions , whereas the transcript abundances of all other CDA genes ap - peared to be extremely low . To complement this data , semi - quantitative RT - PCR was performed on RNA extracted from mycelium grown in complete medium for 72 hr . In this case CDA4 appeared to have the highest transcript abundance , with lower expression detected for CDA1 , CDA3 and CDA8 . No ampli(cid:12)cation was observed in experiments in which the RNA had not been reverse transcribed ( - RT control ) , proving that any observed ampli(cid:12)cation was from cDNA , and not due to gDNA contamination . 122 Figure 4 . 1 : Chitosan is a component of the cell wall in the vegetative hyphae of Mag - naporthe oryzae . The monoclonal anti - chitosan antibody mAbG7 ( A ) and chitosan - speci(cid:12)c probe OGA488 ( B ) were used to test for the presence of chitosan in hyphae grown in liquid CM . Although staining was observed in both cases , OGA488 was both easier to use , and demonstrated stronger labelling of septa and lateral walls . C ) OGA488 labelling of hyphae grown on solid CM , again showing labelling of septa and lateral walls , but also of hyphal tips ( inset ) . D ) Conidia could be labelled with the (cid:13)uorescent dye eosin Y , but not OGA488 ( not shown ) , Scale bar : 20 m m . 123 Figure 4 . 2 : CDA1 and CDA4 are highly expressed during mycelial growth . Expression of CDA genes during vegetative growth , comparing data from transcriptomics ( Soanes et al . , 2012 ) after 36 hr growth in liquid CM ( expressed in Fragments per Kilobase per Million ( FPKM ) ) , and semi - quantitative RT - PCR ( 30 ampli(cid:12)cation cycles ) of RNA isolated from mycelium grown in liquid CM for 72 hr . CDA1 and CDA4 are the most highly expressed genes . (cid:12) - tubulin is included as the reference gene . Deletion of chitin deacetylases From the data outlined above , it appears that two chitin deacetylases are responsible for chitin deacetylation during vegetative growth : CDA1 and CDA4 . In order to characterize the role of this chitin deacetylation , targeted deletion of these genes was performed . In addition , CDA5 was also deleted , both alone and in combination with CDA4 . Like Cda4 , Cda5 also has a putative single transmembrane domain at its C - terminus ( Figure 3 . 2 ) , and so it was considered likely that it may demonstrate redundancy with Cda4 . Targeted gene deletion was performed as described in Chapter 3 , whereby the genes of interest were replaced by a gene encoding an antibiotic resistance gene . The entire coding regions of CDA1 and CDA5 were replaced with HPH , imparting resistance to hygromycin , CDA4 was replaced by BAR , imparting resistance to bialaphos . Primers used for the construction of deletion cassettes are listed in Appendix E ( Primers 1 - 4 , 27 - 34 and 29 - 42 ) . Putative deletion strains were (cid:12)rst screened by PCR , to con(cid:12)rm the loss of the target gene and the integration of the resistance gene at the correct locus ( not shown ) . Con - (cid:12)rmed strains were then subjected to Southern blot analysis , to con(cid:12)rm the presence of a single insertion of the deletion cassette at the desired locus ( Figure 4 . 3 ) . Genomic DNA of 5 putative cda1 lines was digested with Bam HI , and hybridised with a - 32 P labelled 124 DNA encoding HPH . This resulted in the expected 6 . 5 kb band in 4 of the 5 lines , al - though only two of these were free from ectopic insertions . Eco RI digestion of gDNA from putative cda4 lines was hybridised with a - 32 P labelled DNA encoding BAR , result - ing in a visible band at 3 . 8 kb for three of the lines . For cda5 and cda4 / cda5 strains , gDNA was digested with Bgl II and hybridised with a - 32 P labelled DNA encoding HPH . As discussed previously ( Chapter 3 ) , cross - hybridisation occurs between BAR and HPH , due to a similar promoter sequence . This resulted in a 20 kb band occurring in the cda4 background strain , and all cda4 / cda5 lines , due to hybridisation of HPH to BAR at the CDA4 locus . In addition , the expected 6 . 5 kb band was also observed in putative cda5 and cda4 / cda5 lines , indicating successful deletion of CDA5 . In all cases , bands were ab - sent in the WT control strain , con(cid:12)rming the speci(cid:12)city of hybridisation . All successfully generated deletion strains are listed in Appendix F . Cell wall composition of cda1 Cda1 is a predicted secreted protein with a polysaccharide deacetylase domain ( Pfam 01522 ) and a C - terminal chitin binding domain ( Pfam 00187 ) ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . In order to determine whether chitin deacetylation was reduced in the cda1 mutant , mycelial pellets resulting from 72 hr growth in liquid CM were stained with OGA488 . Whilst hyphae of the WT strain demonstrated strong labelling of septa and lateral walls as discussed previously ( Figure 4 . 1 ) , labelling was almost absent in the hyphae of cda1 ( Figure 4 . 4 ) . To test whether this decrease in chitin deacetylation was accompanied by an increase in cell wall chitin content , mycelial pellets were stained with either WGA - FITC or Calco(cid:13)uor White . No clear changes in labelling were observed between hyphae of the WT and cda1 strains , suggesting that reduced chitin deacetylation may not have resulted in a concomitant increase in chitin content . Staining with Calco(cid:13)uor White also allowed hyphal and septum morphology to be observed , but these appeared to be una(cid:11)ected in cda1 . Hyphae growing on solid medium were also stained with OGA488 . However , staining of the hyphae at 1 . 5 - 2 mm from the colony edge appeared to be similar in both the WT and cda1 strains , suggesting that Cda1 may only deacetylate chitin in mature hyphae at the colony interior during growth on solid medium . Lastly , conidia were stained with the chitosan - binding dye eosin Y , but labelling was identical in both strains . 125 Figure 4 . 3 : Targeted deletion of CDA1 , CDA4 and CDA5 . The deletion strategy used was identical to that shown in 3 . 4 , whereby the gene of interest is replaced by an antibiotic resistance gene . Blots containing restriction digested gDNA of putative deletion strains were hy - bridised with a - 32 P labelled DNA homologous to the hygromycin ( CDA1 and CDA5 ) or bialaphos ( CDA4 ) resistance genes . The cartoon above each blot shows the expected band size based upon the positions of the restriction enzymes sites at each locus . Size markers show band size in kilobases ( kb ) . 126 Localization of Cda1 Having established that Cda1 may be required for chitin deacetylation in mature hyphae during vegetative growth , the cda1 mutant was complemented by expressing an mCherry fusion of Cda1 . Primers 51 and 52 ( Appendix E ) were used to amplify the open reading frame of CDA1 ( without the stop codon ) , together with 1 . 8 kb of 5’ promoter sequence ( for native expression of the construct ) . This was cloned into the Asc I site of the pU - CAP vector ( Appendix D ) , thereby fusing mCherry to the C - terminus of Cda1 . After transformation into the cda1 background strain , antibiotic - resistant transformants were screened for (cid:13)uorescence during vegetative growth . Although (cid:13)uorescence was observed in a number of lines , it only appeared to be stable in one of these ( Appendix F ) . In strains expressing Cda1 : mCherry , weak (cid:13)uorescence was observed in the lateral walls of hyphae , with much stronger (cid:13)uorescence associated with septa . Here , (cid:13)uores - cence localized both as a ring to the outer edge of the septum , or to the entire septum ( Figure 4 . 5A ) . Expression of Cda1 : mCherry was restricted to mature hyphae ; on solid medium (cid:13)uorescence was not observed in hyphae growing at the colony edge . No dif - ferences in (cid:13)uorescence localization were observed between hyphae grown in liquid or on solid medium . In order to gain an insight into Cda1 : mCherry expression at the colony level , colonies expressing Cda1 : mCherry were observed under a (cid:13)uorescence stereoscope . Fluorescence was not detected from the outer (cid:24) 5 mm of colonies , but was extremely strong in the entire colony interior ( Figure 4 . 5B ) . These (cid:12)ndings are consistent with those showing that Cda1 is not required for chitin deacetylation in hyphae at the colony margins , only in mature hyphae in the colony interior . Cda1 : mCherry (cid:13)uorescence was not observed at any other stages in the life - cycle , including during appressorium devel - opment , conidiation or in planta growth , suggesting that it is speci(cid:12)c to the vegetative growth phase . Figure 4 . 4 ( following page ) : Chitosan content is dramatically reduced in the CDA1 deletion strain . A ) Mycelial growth after a 72 hr incubation in liquid CM , stained with OGA488 , WGA - FITC or calco(cid:13)uor white to test for presence and localization of chitosan and chitin re - spectively . Staining with OGA488 was dramatically reduced in the cda1 mutant , suggesting a reduction in chitosan , whereas chitin content appeared to be una(cid:11)ected . B ) Staining of hyphae grown on solid medium ( approximately 1 . 5 - 2 mm from the colony edge ) with OGA488 , showing similar labelling in the WT and cda1 strains . C ) Staining of conidia with eosin Y . Scale bars : 20 m m for A and C , 50 m m for B . 127 128 Figure 4 . 5 : mCherry tagged Cda1 complements the deletion strain and colocalizes with chitosan . A ) mCherry was tagged to the C - terminus of Cda1 , and expressed in cda1 . Re - stored staining with OGA488 was observed ( middle panel ) , which colocalized with the mCherry (cid:13)uorescence . mCherry (cid:13)uorescence was most intense at the septa of vegetative hyphae ( in both liquid and solid media ) , but was also evident in the lateral walls . Scale bars : 20 m m . B ) Fluo - rescence heat map of a colony expressing Cda1 : mCherry . Fluorescence was not detected at the colony margin ( marked by the pink dashed line ) , but increased strongly towards the colony centre . A small amount of auto(cid:13)uorescence was observed in WT colonies . White scale bars : 10 mm , red scale bars : 20 , 000 (cid:13)uorescence units . To see if expression of Cda1 : mCherry was able to complement cda1 , OGA488 staining was performed on mycelial pellets grown in liquid CM . Not only was staining fully restored in the complemented strain , proving the functionality of the fusion protein , but it partially colocalized with the mCherry (cid:13)uorescence of Cda1 : mCherry ( Figure 4 . 5A ) . Phenotypic characterization of cda1 Cda1 is necessary for chitin deacetylation in the septa and lateral walls of mature veg - etative hyphae . To determine the role of chitin deacetylation in these locations , growth of the cda1 mutant was evaluated under a range of di(cid:11)erent stress conditions on solid and in liquid media . For growth on solid medium , the cda1 mutant was subjected to chitin - binding cell wall perturbants ( Calco(cid:13)uor White and Congo Red ) ( Herth , 1980 ) , oxidants ( hydrogen peroxide ) , heavy metal ( copper ) , osmotic stress ( sorbitol ) , membrane perturbant ( SDS ) , ca(cid:11)eine ( an activator of the cell wall integrity pathway ( Kuranda 129 Figure 4 . 6 : Radial growth on solid media is una(cid:11)ected in cda1 .

Radial growth was measured at 10 days post - inoculation , but no signi(cid:12)cant di(cid:11)erences were found between the WT strain and the cda1 mutant ( Student’s T - test , p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 4 . 6 ) . In addition , no consistent di(cid:11)erences in colony appearance between the WT and cda1 strains were observed under any conditions ( Figure 4 . 6B ) . In liquid medium , growth was evaluated in the presence of lysing enzymes ( a mixture of chitinases , glucanases and proteases ) , SDS , or hydrogen peroxide . Unexpectedly , the cda1 mutant appeared to be more resistant to lysing enzymes and SDS , with greater biomass measured in (cid:13)asks of cda1 compared with the WT or complemented strain ( Figure 4 . 7 ) . However , further work is required to determine if these di(cid:11)erences are statistically signi(cid:12)cant . Lastly , pathogenic development was evaluated in the cda1 mutant . Conidia of cda1 germinated on a hydrophobic glass surface developed appressoria with identical morphol - ogy to WT . Unsurprisingly , pathogenicity was also una(cid:11)ected in cda1 ; rice leaves inoc - ulated with cda1 conidia demonstrated similar lesion density to the WT strain ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . CDA1 is therefore not required for pathogenic development in M . oryzae . 130 Figure 4 . 7 : The cda1 strain shows increased resistance to cell wall stress in liquid cul - ture .

Scale bars : 0 . 5 cm . 131 Ectopic expression of Cda1 : mCherry In the previous chapter , CBP1 : mCherry was ectopically expressed in order to investigate how chitin deacetylation in(cid:13)uences cell wall integrity and cellular morphology . However , these strains appeared to be identical to the WT and thus failed to answer these questions . In a further attempt , CDA1 : mCherry was ectopically expressed in the WT background strain . In this case , expression was driven by the constitutive EF1 promoter . Firstly , pEF1 and the CDA1 ORF were ampli(cid:12)ed individually using primer pairs 77 / 78 and 79 / 52 respectively ( Appendix E ) , then joined by fusion PCR ( primers 77 and 52 ) . The pEF1 : CDA1 fusion was cloned into the Asc I site of pUCAP ( Appendix D ) to create the mCherry fusion . Following successful transformation , several independent lines ectopi - cally expressing Cda1 : mCherry were identi(cid:12)ed ( Listed in Appendix F ) , and characterized during vegetative growth and pathogenic development . During vegetative growth , strong (cid:13)uorescence localized to the hyphal septa , with weaker (cid:13)uorescence at the lateral walls , just as observed previously with the natively expressed Cda1 : mCherry , and ectopically expressed Cbp1 : mCherry . Such (cid:13)uorescence also appeared to be restricted to the mature hyphae , and was not observed in those growing at colony margins ( Figure 4 . 9 ) . Both hyphal morphology and overall colony ap - pearance were una(cid:11)ected by ectopic expression of Cda1 : mCherry . In conidia germinated on a hydrophobic glass surface , (cid:13)uorescence was observed in the cell walls of the coni - dia , germ tubes and appressoria , although intracellular localization ( most likely vacuolar ) was also apparent . Intriguingly , a ring of (cid:13)uorescence was occasionally observed at the centre of conidial septa , possibly demarcating the septal pores ( not shown ) . Although germling morphology was identical to the WT in pEF1 : CDA1 : mCherry strains , staining with OGA488 demonstrated that ectopic chitin deacetylation had occurred in the conidial wall ( Figure 4 . 9C ) . When inoculated onto onion epidermis , pEF1 : CDA1 : mCherry strains were able to penetrate the plant cells and form invasive hyphae , just as in the WT strain , with (cid:13)uorescence localizing to the walls of invasive hyphae ( Figure 4 . 9B ) . Cell wall composition in cda4 , cda5 and cda4 / cda5 Unlike Cda1 , Cda4 and Cda5 each have a single putative transmembrane - domain at their C - terminus , suggesting that these chitin deacetylases may be membrane - localized , with 132 Figure 4 . 9 : Ectopic expression of CDA1 : mCherry by the constitutive EF1 pro - moter .

To determine whether Cda4 and Cda5 have roles in chitin deacetylation during vegetative growth , OGA488 staining was performed in the cda4 and cda4 / cda5 mutants . When mycelial pellets resulting from 72 hr growth in liquid CM were stained with OGA488 , no reduction in staining was observed in the deletion strains , in contrast to previous (cid:12)ndings with the cda1 mutant . However , when hyphae grown on solid CM were stained , reduced labelling was observed in hyphae close to the colony edge in both cda4 and cda4 / cda5 ( Figure 4 . 10 ) . Staining was not completely abolished ; septa in particular continued to show some (cid:13)uorescence , possibly due to the action of Cda1 . It was also unclear from this experiment whether staining was more reduced in cda4 / cda5 , compared with in cda4 . Conidia of the deletion strains were stained with eosin Y , but no reduction in labelling was observed . These data suggest that Cda4 and Cda5 are required for chitin deacetylation in hyphae at the colony margins , but not those in the colony interior , in contrast to Cda1 . Localization of Cda4 : mCherry In order to gain further insight into chitin deacetylation by Cda4 , an mCherry fusion was created . Primers 53 and 54 ( Appendix E ) were used to amplify the entire open reading frame of Cda4 ( without the stop codon ) , including 2 kb of 5’ promoter sequence ( for na - tive expression of the construct ) . This was cloned into the Asc I site of the pUCAP vector ( Appendix D ) , thereby fusing mCherry to the C - terminus of Cda4 . After transformation into both the WT and cda4 background strains , a number of antibiotic - resistant transfor - mants were screened for (cid:13)uorescence during vegetative growth . Six independent lines ( 3 in each background strain , listed in Appendix F ) demonstrating (cid:13)uorescence in vegetative hyphae were selected for characterization . As expected , the strongest (cid:13)uorescence was observed in hyphae at the colony edges . Surprisingly however , this (cid:13)uorescence was en - tirely intracellular , as evidenced by the lack of colocalization with OGA488 ( Figure 4 . 11A and E ) . In regions of the hyphae more distal to the tip , (cid:13)uorescence was present in large intracellular bodies characteristic of vacuoles . At hyphal tips , Cda4 : mCherry was not observed in the Spitzenk(cid:127)orper , but localized to tubular structures , small punctae , or in a more di(cid:11)use pattern , possibly indicating either cytoplasmic localization , or localization to very small compartments below the resolution limit of the microscope . Fluorescence was 134 Figure 4 . 10 : CDA4 and CDA5 are required for chitin deacetylation in vegetative hyphae . A ) Staining of chitosan in vegetative hyphae grown on solid media in the WT , cda4 and cda4 / cda5 strains , showing reduced chitosan staining in the deletion strains .

Staining was again una(cid:11)ected in the double deletion strain . Scale bars : 50 m m in A and 20 m m in B and C . 135 also observed in developing conidia , again in intracellular bodies . Lastly , whilst no (cid:13)uo - rescence was observed during appressorium development or in invasive hyphae , possible vacuolar (cid:13)uorescence was observed in appressoria post - penetration ( Figure 4 . 11C ) . Due to the presence of a transmembrane domain at the C - terminus of Cda4 , it was considered that the fusion of mCherry immediately adjacent to this ( albeit with a 10aa linker sequence ) may have disrupted localization of the protein . In order to indepen - dently verify the localization of Cda4 observed with the C - terminal fusion , an additional mCherry fusion was constructed . In this case , the mCherry was cloned into CDA4 af - ter the putative signal peptide , such that the mCherry would be at the N - terminus of the mature protein . However , strains transformed with this construct only exhibited weak (cid:13)uorescence in comparison to the C - terminal fusion described above , although the localization appeared to be similar . As with previously discussed fusion proteins , it was important to determine whether the C - terminal Cda4 : mCherry fusion was functional . To do this , hyphae of the comple - mented strains were grown on solid CM and stained with OGA488 . This revealed that chitin deacetylation was fully restored in cda4 strains expressing CDA4 : mCherry . In fact , staining appeared stronger than in the WT strain , suggesting over - complementation . This proves the functionality of the Cda4 : mCherry fusion protein , although its level of expres - sion may be higher than that of the native protein , possibly due to the copy number of the transformed construct , or regulatory elements which were not included in the construct . In some cases , the absence of a fusion protein from the plasma membrane is simply due to rapid endocytic recycling of the protein , which means that it does not accumulate to detectable quantities at the cell periphery . To see if this was the case with Cda4 : mCherry , hyphae were treated with latrunculin A ( LatA ) , which prevents polymerization of actin and has previously been used to help localization of proteins to the cell membrane ( Lanver et al . , 2010 ) . However , after a 30 min incubation with 1 m g / ml LatA , no (cid:13)uorescence at the cell periphery was observed , and distribution of internal (cid:13)uorescence also appeared to be una(cid:11)ected ( not shown ) . The localization of Cda4 : mCherry to small punctae near the hyphal tip was intriguing , and reminiscent of the localization of (cid:13)uorescently - tagged chitin synthases observed in numerous previous studies ( Fajardo - Somera et al . , 2015 ; Treitschke et al . , 2010 ) . It was 136 Figure 4 . 11 : mCherry tagged Cda4 complements the deletion strain and localizes intracellularly . A ) and B ) Intracellular localization of Cda4 : mCherry in vegetative hyphae and conidia respectively . During plant cell infection , (cid:13)uorescence was observed in appressoria , but not in invasive hyphae ( C ) . D ) Staining of chitosan in vegetative hyphae grown on solid media , showing restored chitosan synthesis in cda4 / CDA4 : mCherry strains ( two independent lines are shown ) .

Note : Picture brightness and contrast have been increased in A - C to improve clarity upon printing . 137 hypothesized that Cda4 : mCherry may therefore colocalize with a chitin synthase , which would provide a valuable insight into possible coordinated transport of these proteins and the mechanism of chitin deacetylation . There are 7 chitin synthases in M . oryzae , which could possibly colocalize with Cda4 : mCherry ( Kong et al . , 2012 ) . However , taking into consideration previous work , three of the chitin synthases could be discounted : Chs7 is speci(cid:12)c to appressorium development , and no (cid:13)uorescence was observed in vegetative hyphae in strains expressing the Chs7 : 2xYFP construct used in Chapter 3 . Chs5 and Chs6 both have myosin motor domains , and this class of Chs usually localizes to the Spitzenk(cid:127)orper and plasma membrane , which was not observed with Cda4 : mCherry . This leaves Chs1 , Chs2 , Chs3 and Chs4 as potential colocalization partners . Previous work lo - calizing Chs1 suggested that this was a likely candidate ; Chs1 : eGFP localized to hyphal tips and to developing conidia , although unfortunately only low magni(cid:12)cation epi(cid:13)uo - rescence pictures were available for reference ( Kong et al . , 2012 ) . To see if Chs1 : eGFP colocalizes with Chs4 : mCherry , (cid:12)rst the Chs1 : eGFP construct was cloned in precisely the same way as described previously ( Kong et al . , 2012 ) : the open reading frame of Chs1 , together with 1 . 4 kb of native promoter sequence was ampli(cid:12)ed with primers 61 and 62 ( Appendix E ) . This was cloned into the Asc I - Sbf I sites of the pUCAP vector ( Appendix D ) , producing a C - terminal fusion of eGFP to Chs1 . This construct was pre - viously used to complement the chs1 mutant , suggesting full functionality of the fusion protein . The plasmid was transformed into the CDA4 : mCherry background strain , and antibiotic resistant transformants screened for (cid:13)uorescence . Several independent (cid:13)uo - rescent lines were selected for characterization ( Appendix F ) . Unfortunately , although Chs1 : eGFP and Cda4 : mCherry were often expressed in the same hyphae , colocalization of the fusion proteins was not observed . Chs1 : eGFP (cid:13)uorescence localized to the cell periphery and Spitzenk(cid:127)orper at hyphal tips , in contrast to Cda4 : mCherry . In addition , although Chs1 : eGFP also demonstrated intracellular localization , this only colocalized with Cda4 : mCherry in the larger intracellular bodies , most likely vacuoles ( Figure 4 . 12 ) . Phenotypic characterization of the cda4 , cda5 and cda4 / cda5 mutants Cda4 appears to be necessary for chitin deacetylation in hyphae at colony margins . In order to determine the impact of CDA4 and CDA5 deletion upon cell wall integrity and 138 Figure 4 . 12 : mCherry tagged Cda4 does not colocalize with eGFP tagged chitin synthase I . Chs1 : eGFP localized to the cell periphery at hyphal tips , and also to intracellular punctae ( possible ‘chitosomes’ ) . Some colocalization with Cda4 : mCherry was observed in larger intracellular bodies , but not at the cell periphery . Scale bars : 20 m m . Note : Picture brightness and contrast have been increased to improve clarity upon printing . 139 hyphal morphogenesis , radial growth of the deletion strains was assessed on solid media under a range of stress conditions ( as described previously for the cda1 mutant ) . This revealed that small , but statistically signi(cid:12)cant ( Students T - test , p < 0 . 01 ) reductions in growth occurred in the deletion strains compared with the WT ( Figure 4 . 13A ) . However , although these growth reductions were statistically signi(cid:12)cant , in reality they generally represent less than a 10 % reduction in growth , and , as such , their biological signi(cid:12)cance is questionable . For example , two independent cda4 / cda5 lines ( 13 and 23 ) were char - acterized in these growth experiments , but they did not demonstrate equivalent growth reductions under identical conditions . This suggests that the observed changes may not be related to the deletion of the genes themselves , but perhaps to ‘cryptic’ changes occur - ring during the transformation process . The largest reductions in growth were observed on media containing 2 . 5mM ca(cid:11)eine , where colony diameters were consistently (cid:24) 15 % smaller in the deletion strains relative to the WT . Ca(cid:11)eine is known to activate the cell wall integrity pathway in a Tor1 - dependant manner in S . cerevisiae . In addition , inhibi - tion of Tor1 by the antibiotic rapamycin produced a transcriptional response that was very similar to cells treated with ca(cid:11)eine ( Kuranda et al . , 2006 ) . However , growth of the deletion strains on media containing rapamycin was only marginally reduced , although this reduction is statistically signi(cid:12)cant . Pathogenic development was also evaluated in the deletion strains . Unsurprisingly , given the apparent speci(cid:12)city of these genes to vegetative hyphae , appressorium develop - ment on hydrophobic glass and pathogenicity on rice leaves was una(cid:11)ected in the deletion strains ( Figure 4 . 14 ) . Appressorium development from the tips of vegetative hyphae was also evaluated , but also appeared to be una(cid:11)ected in the deletion strains ( not shown ) . 140 Figure 4 . 13 : Radial growth of the cda4 and cda4 / cda5 strains is largely una(cid:11)ected on solid media .

However , it was not known whether chitosan is also present in the cell wall at other stages of the life - cycle in these fungi . In this chapter , chitosan has been shown to be a component of the cell wall in the vegetative hyphae of M . oryzae , suggest - ing that chitin deacetylation has roles beyond those already described for appressorium development . Two chitin deacetylases ( Cda1 and Cda4 ) were found to be necessary for chitin deacetylation in vegetative hyphae . Interestingly , they appear to be involved in two distinct modes of chitin deacetylation , in discrete zones of colonies . Cda1 , a predicted secreted protein with a chitin deacetylase domain and a single C - terminal chitin - binding domain , is required for in situ chitin deacetylation in the cell walls of mature hyphae located in the colony interior . The role of chitin deacetylation in these hyphae is currently unclear . Considering that expression of Cda1 is restricted to mature hyphae , it is unlikely that it plays a direct role in growth or hyphal morpho - genesis . Indeed , radial growth of the cda1 mutant on solid media was identical to the WT strain under a range of stress conditions , including cell wall perturbants ( Congo Red and Calco(cid:13)uor white ) , detergents ( SDS ) and hyperosmotic stress . However , in liquid media cda1 appeared to demonstrate increased resistance to cell wall lysing enzymes and SDS . Since the susceptibility of strains to these treatments is likely to correlate with the permeability of the cell wall ( De Nobel and Barnett , 1991 ) , this could indicate that cell wall permeability is reduced in the cda1 mutant . Chitin is known to be a highly crys - talline polysaccharide , and therefore has low permeability . It is hypothesized that the deacetylation of chitin by Cda1 would cause loss of crystallinity , and therefore increased permeability . Thus , the biological role of chitin deacetylation by Cda1 could be to in - crease cell wall permeability in the septa and lateral walls of mature hyphae . Septa have been shown to be sites of protein secretion in hyphae ( Hayakawa et al . , 2011 ) , and so e(cid:14)cient secretion from septa may be dependant upon high cell wall permeability . Further work is required to characterize wall permeability and to determine whether septal protein secretion is defective in cda1 . In addition to cell wall permeability , it is also important to consider the e(cid:11)ects that chitin deacetylation may have on cell wall charge . As discussed 142 previously , chitosan is a polycationic polysaccharide , whereas chitin is uncharged . The deacetylation of chitin is therefore likely to increase the positive charge of the cell wall , which would increase its interaction with a negatively charged molecule , such as SDS . In the case of the cda1 mutant , the absence of chitosan would result in reduced interaction of SDS with the cell wall , perhaps explaining the increased resistance . Whether or not the change in cell wall charge caused by chitin deacetylation has any biological signi(cid:12) - cance is another matter , and requires further investigation . Lastly , an additional role for chitin deacetylation by Cda1 in mature hyphae could be as part of a carbon - recycling mechanism . The cell wall is a major carbon source , and so its deconstruction could serve to redistribute this carbon from the aged parts of the fungal colony to the growing edge . Chitin deacetylation could either serve as a direct source of carbon in the form of acetate ( released by the deacetylation reaction ) , or be the (cid:12)rst step to making the cell wall of old hyphae more susceptible to degradation by chitinases and glucanases . However , no evidence for a role in carbon - recycling was found in the present study . Firstly , CDA1 appears to be highly expressed even after a relatively short incubation in nutrient - rich complete medium , at which point carbon - recycling from the cell wall would probably not be necessary . Secondly , under conditions of carbon or nitrogen starvation on solid medium , no reduction in radial growth was observed . Yet , further investigation is re - quired before this hypothesis can be dismissed ; more sensitive methods may be required to study the e(cid:14)ciency of carbon recycling from the cell wall in the cda1 mutant . The in situ deacetylation of chitin by Cda1 suggests that the chitin is deacetylated post - synthesis in mature hyphae . Previously , it had been suggested that crystalline chitin in the cell wall was not susceptible to deacetylation , due to inaccessibility of the substrate ( Davis and Bartnicki - Garcia , 1984b ) . However , data from this study suggests that this may not necessarily be the case . The chitin in the septa and lateral walls of hyphae is presumably crystalline ( although there is no way to determine this ) , and yet it is able to be deacetylated by Cda1 . In addition , ectopic expression of Cda1 : mCherry resulted in ectopic chitin deacetylation in the conidial cell wall . It is therefore likely that crys - talline chitin can be deacetylated in vivo , although the extent of deacetylation cannot be determined from the current data . Certain properties of Cda1 render it more active against crystalline chitin than previously characterized chitin deacetylases . In particular , 143 the presence of the chitin - binding domain may increase deacetylase activity on crystalline chitin , by increasing substrate binding of the enzyme , and / or by disrupting chitin struc - ture and increasing accessibility ( Guill(cid:19)en et al . , 2010 ) . Chitosan was also found in the cell walls of vegetative hyphae located in the sub - peripheral zone of colonies , although Cda1 was not required for its synthesis here . Chitin deacetylation in these cells required Cda4 , and perhaps to a lesser extent Cda5 , two pre - dicted secreted proteins with putative single transmembrane domains . The role of chitin deacetylation in these cells also remains unclear , but it may be associated with hyphal maturation . During this process , chitosan could serve to cross - link components of the wall , either ionically or covalently , thereby increasing the strength and rigidity of the cell wall . Another cell wall process which is associated with hyphal maturation is melaniza - tion . Cells at the growing edge of colonies are unmelanized , but become melanized with increased distance from the colony margin . As of yet , there is no evidence for a direct link between chitosan and melanin in the cell wall , and melanization proceeded normally in all the cda mutants ( including those involved in appressorium development ) . A ‘leaky melanin’ phenotype was observed in C . neoformans strains lacking chitosan ( Baker et al . , 2007 ) , but this is more likely to be a general symptom of reduced cell wall integrity , rather than evidence of a direct link between chitosan and melanin . The staining of chitosan in these hyphae was reduced in the cda4 and cda4 / cda5 strains , but the loss of chitosan had little impact on radial growth . This suggests that chitin deacetylation is not required for cell wall integrity or morphogenesis in these hy - phae , although this may be due to compensatory changes in cell wall composition , which were not investigated . The deletion strains did appear to be more sensitive to ca(cid:11)eine , but even then the reduction in growth was less than 15 % compared with the WT . Addi - tionally , since ca(cid:11)eine has pleiotropic e(cid:11)ects on cells ( Kuranda et al . , 2006 ) , the increased sensitivity of the deletion strains to this chemical does not necessarily provide any par - ticular insight into the role played by Cda4 and Cda5 . However , numerous studies have found that mutations in components of the cell wall integrity signalling pathway or in genes with roles in cell wall biogenesis are also more sensitive to ca(cid:11)eine ( Levin , 2011 ) . The change in cell wall composition caused by deletion of CDA4 and CDA5 most likely causes the increased ca(cid:11)eine sensitivity , but the mechanism behind this is unknown . 144 Unlike Cda1 : mCherry , the Cda4 : mCherry fusion localized intracellularly , suggesting that Cda4 does not deacetylate chitin in situ in the cell wall . Instead , Cda4 may deacety - late nascent chitin chains in collaboration with a particular chitin synthase . Although Cda4 : mCherry did not colocalize with Chs1 : eGFP , it is hypothesized that Cda4 may colo - calize with another chitin synthase ( perhaps Chs2 , Chs3 or Chs4 ) in intracellular vesicles ( chitosomes ) . There are two possible models for chitin deacetylation involving Cda4 . In the (cid:12)rst , the synthesis of chitin and its subsequent deacetylation by Cda4 occurs intra - cellularly . The vesicles , loaded with chitin and chitosan , could then deliver their cargo to the cell wall . In support of this model , the synthesis of chitin by chitin synthases isolated from chitosomes has been demonstrated previously in Mucor rouxii ( Davis and Bartnicki - Garcia , 1984a ) . This suggests that chitin synthases residing in the chitosomes are active , at least in vitro . However , no chitin deacetylase activity was found associ - ated with chitosomes in this fungus ( Davis and Bartnicki - Garcia , 1984a ) , and in vivo chitin synthesis in chitosomes has never been demonstrated . In the second model , the chitin synthase and Cda4 remain inactive until delivered to the plasma membrane , where deacetylation of nascent chitin chains occurs . The absence of detectable Cda4 : mCherry at the cell periphery may simply be a result of very low levels of the enzyme . This would be consistent with nascent chitin chains being highly susceptible to deacetylation , and therefore only small amounts of enzyme would be required for complete deacetylation ( Davis and Bartnicki - Garcia , 1984b ) . In both models , the transmembrane domain of Cda4 could serve to allow close association between the chitin synthase and Cda4 . This may be required for sorting and loading of the enzymes into the same vesicles , as well as positioning Cda4 close to the nascent chitin chains . It was originally hypothesized that chitin deacetylation would be required for cellular morphogenesis during vegetative growth , just as it was hypothesized to be important for appressorium morphogenesis in the previous chapter . Again , however , no evidence for this was found . Firstly , the localization of chitosan observed with OGA488 did not support a role in morphogenesis ; (cid:13)uorescence was only occasionally observed at hyphal tips ( and even then not exclusively so ) , was not detected in conidia and did not speci(cid:12)cally localize to hyphal branching sites . Secondly , deletion strains in which chitin deacetylation in the vegetative hyphae was severely reduced displayed no defects in cell shape or growth . 145 Lastly , the ectopic expression of Cda1 : mCherry , which caused ectopic chitin deacetylation , also failed to demonstrate morphogenic defects . Taken together , it can be concluded that chitin deacetylation has no role in cellular morphogenesis during vegetative growth in M . oryzae . 4 . 4 Conclusions The investigation of chitin deacetylation in vegetative hyphae has led to novel insights into the roles and mechanisms of chitin deacetylation in M . oryzae . The presence of chitosan in vegetative hyphae suggests that chitin deacetylation has roles beyond those already hypothesized during pathogenic development in phytopathogenic fungi . However , from the localization of chitosan , deletion and localization of chitin deacetylases , and ectopic expression of chitin deacetylase , it is clear that chitin deacetylation is neither required for , nor involved in , the process of cellular morphogenesis in vegetative hyphae . The ac - tual purpose of chitin deacetylation in vegetative hyphae was not able to be determined conclusively , although it appears that this may di(cid:11)er according to the phase of growth . Cda1 deacetylates chitin in mature hyphae at the colony interior , which may be required for e(cid:14)cient protein secretion or carbon recycling from the cell wall . In contrast , Cda4 is required for chitin deacetylation in the sub - peripheral region of the colony , although there may be some overlap between Cda1 and Cda4 . As well as being spatially separated , deacetylation by these CDAs also appears to occur by distinct mechanisms . Cda1 deacety - lates chitin in situ , whereas Cda4 may collaborate with a chitin synthase to deacetylate nascent chitin chains . This gives a further insight into the possible coordination between these enzymes , as previously discussed in Chapter 3 . 146 Chapter 5 Hydrolysis of chitosan 147 5 . 1 Introduction In the previous chapters ( Chapters 3 and 4 ) , chitin deacetylation was revealed to play roles in appressorium development and vegetative growth . In this Chapter , the role of chitosan hydrolysis is investigated . Roles of cell wall hydrolases in fungi For each major polysaccharide component present in the cell wall , there is an enzyme responsible for its hydrolysis . These cell wall hydrolases include enzymes with chitinase , b 1 , 3 - glucanase , a 1 , 3 - glucanase , mannanase and chitosanase activities . The enzymatic hydrolysis of the cell wall has been shown to have numerous roles in fungi . However , there remain many aspects of this process that are poorly understood , particularly in (cid:12)lamentous fungi . In fungal species with a unicellular growth phase , cell wall hydrolases have an impor - tant role in cell - separation . In S . cerevisiae , enzymatic degradation of the septum during cell - separation is performed by both a chitinase ( Cts1 ) and an endo - b 1 , 3 - glucanase ( Eng1 ) ( Kuranda and Robbins , 1991 ; Baladr(cid:19)on et al . , 2002 ) . Strains in which these genes have been deleted produce clumps or chains of cells , due to failed septum degradation . Similar results have been obtained in C . albicans , for the chitinase Cht3 and endo - b 1 , 3 - glucanase Eng1 , which are functional homologues of Cts1 and Eng1 in S . cerevisiae respectively ( D(cid:127)unkler et al . , 2005 ; Esteban et al . , 2005 ) . In S . pombe , the septum is composed of both b 1 , 3 - glucan and a 1 , 3 - glucan , and cell separation requires the endo - a 1 , 3 - glucanase Agn1 and the endo - b 1 , 3 - glucanase Eng1 ( Dekker et al . , 2004 ) . Another pair of glucanases , the endo - a 1 , 3 - glucanase Agn2 and the endo - b 1 , 3 - glucanase Eng2 are required for degradation of the ascus wall , and release of ascospores in S . pombe ( Dekker et al . , 2004 ; del Dedo et al . , 2009 ) . Recently , a pair of chitinases were also found to be required for cell - separation during the yeast - growth phase of U . maydis ( Langner et al . , 2015 ) . As well as being involved in cell separation , there is also evidence for a role of cell wall hydrolases in cell fusion , which requires localized degradation of the cell wall between two cells . In S . pombe , a number of glucanases including Agn2 , Eng2 and Exg3 localize to the fusion focus and are required for e(cid:14)cient cell fusion ( Dudin et al . , 2015 ) . In numerous species of (cid:12)lamentous fungi , cell wall hydrolases have been shown to be 148 important for autolysis , a natural process occurring in ageing fungal cultures and those growing under nutrient - limiting conditions ( White et al . , 2002 ) . During autolysis , cells are degraded in order to provide nutrients for continued growth . As a carbohydrate - rich structure , the cell wall represents a valuable source of nutrients . In Aspergillus nidulans the chitinase ChiB and endo - b 1 , 3 - glucanase EngA are both required for optimal autolysis during carbon starvation ( Shin et al . , 2009 ; Szil(cid:19)agyi et al . , 2010 ) . Similar (cid:12)ndings were obtained in Aspergillus niger , where the chitinase CfcA and a 1 , 3 - glucanase AgnB were required for starvation - induced autolysis ( van Munster et al . , 2014 ) . In other fungi , functional data demonstrating the involvement of hydrolytic enzymes in autolysis has not been found , although increased glucanase or chitinase activity is observed in aged cultures of Botrytis cinerea ( Stahmann et al . , 1992 ) , Penicillium oxilacum ( Copa - Pati ~ no et al . , 1989 ) and Coprinellus congregatus ( Lim and Choi , 2009 ) . Apart from degrading their own cell walls , many hydrolytic enzymes have also been found to have antagonistic roles in fungi . In A . nidulans the C - II subgroup of chitinases are induced during interactions with B . cinerea and R . solani , and A . nidulans deletion strains show increased growth in mixed cultures with B . cinerea ( Tzelepis et al . , 2014 ) . Tricho - derma species also produce a range of chitinase , glucanases and proteases with potential roles in antagonistic interactions ( Viterbo et al . , 2002 ) . In particular , a 42 kDa chitinase ( Cht42 ) has been shown to be a key enzyme involved in mycoparasitic interactions ; this enzyme is upregulated during confrontation between T . atroviride ( Kullnig et al . , 2000 ) , and deletion of CHT42 in T . virens demonstrated reduced biocontrol activities against R . solani ( Baek et al . , 1999 ) . Cell wall hydrolases clearly have a number of roles in large - scale degradation of the cell wall . However , it has been hypothesized that cell wall hydrolysis may also play a role in cell wall remodelling . At hyphal tips , a balance of synthase and hydrolase activities may maintain the cell wall in a pliable state , whilst at branching sites , highly regulated and restricted hydrolysis of the wall may result in enhanced localized (cid:13)exibility , necessary to allow cell expansion ( Bartnicki - Garcia , 1973 ) . Currently , there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses . For example , in C . albicans chitinase activity was unaltered by the deletion of chitin synthases , and vice versa , suggesting that these enzymes are functionally independent ( Selvaggini et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , in the majority of cases 149 deletion of chitinases or glucanases does not result in a measurable change in growth or morphogenesis . Even a quintuple knockout of class III chitinase genes in A . fumigatus did not result in any growth or germination defects ( Alcazar - Fuoli et al . , 2011 ) , neither did a double knockout of the chitinases CtcB and CfcI in A . niger ( van Munster et al . , 2013 ) . Single chitinase deletions have also been performed in a number of species , including N . crassa ( Tzelepis et al . , 2012 ) , A . fumigatus ( Jaques et al . , 2003 ) and Y . lipolytica ( Park et al . , 2014 ) , which also largely failed to demonstrate morphogenic defects . Yet , there are some exceptions : Deletion of the GPI - anchored chitinase Chit - 1 in N . crassa resulted in a reduced growth rate , supporting a possible role in wall remodelling during hyphal growth ( Tzelepis et al . , 2012 ) ; in Penicillium chrysogenum deletion of ChiB1 a(cid:11)ected cell wall integrity ( Kamerewerd et al . , 2011 ) . In C . neoformans , deletion of all four endochitinases did not a(cid:11)ect vegetative growth or morphology , but prevented mating ( Baker et al . , 2009 ) . Glucanases have been the subject of fewer studies than chitinases , but deletion of these too has often failed to provide evidence for morphogenic roles : Deletion strains of the endo - b 1 , 3 - glucanases Eng2 and EglC in A . fumigatus and A . nidulans respectively were identical to the WT strain ( Choi et al . , 2005 ; Hartl et al . , 2011 ) . However , a recently characterized family of glucan - modifying enzymes do appear to have intriguing roles in morphogenesis . The SUN proteins enzymes have exo b 1 , 3 - glucanase activity and belong to a newly classi(cid:12)ed GH132 family . Deletion of SUN1 in A . fumigatus resulted in a number of morphogenic defects , including intrahyphal hyphae and leaky hyphal tips , which were attributed to a possible role in cell wall biogenesis and septation ( Gastebois et al . , 2013 ) . Exactly how the biochemical activity of the SUN proteins relates to their biological function remains unknown . One signi(cid:12)cant obstacle preventing the detailed analysis of cell wall hydrolysing en - zymes is their frequent functional redundancy . In most fungi , chitinases and glucanases exist in large multigene families , which are likely able to compensate for the loss of a single gene . Genetic disruption of entire gene families will therefore be required if the function of cell wall hydrolases is to be determined . Only certain species of fungi have small enough gene families for this to be possible using current gene - deletion techniques . A notable example is Ashbya gossypii , which has just a single chitinase gene . Interest - ingly , (cid:12)lamentous growth is una(cid:11)ected by the deletion of this gene and only a mild defect 150 in sporulation was observed ( D(cid:127)unkler et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that chitin hydrolysis is not required for hyphal morphogenesis in this fungus . A recent study in U . maydis also casts doubt over the involvement of chitin hydrolysis in morphogenesis . Deletion of all four chitinase genes , which led to complete loss of chitinase activity , did not impair (cid:12)lamentous growth or pathogenicity of the fungus ( Langner et al . , 2015 ) . The localization of cell wall hydrolysing enzymes could also o(cid:11)er some insight into their roles , although this has only been performed in a few cases . In A . nidulans an eGFP fusion of the chitinase ChiA localized to hyphal branching sites , and to conidial germination sites , thus supporting its role in morphogenesis ( Yamazaki et al . , 2008 ) . However , the functionality of this fusion protein was not proven , and deletion of ChiA did not result in any growth defects ( Yamazaki et al . , 2007 ) . Conversely , a dsRed fusion of ChiB1 in Penicillium chrysogenum showed no such speci(cid:12)c localization , (cid:13)uorescence was observed at the entire cell surface ( Kamerewerd et al . , 2011 ) . In summary , whilst cell wall hydrolases clearly have a multitude of roles in fungi , only some of these are supported by conclusive evidence . There is ample evidence to support a role for chitinases and glucanases in cell - separation , cell fusion , autolysis and in antago - nistic interactions . However , roles in cell wall remodelling have been much more di(cid:14)cult to demonstrate , and our understanding of the link between cell wall hydrolysis and mor - phogenesis is far from complete . This is partly due to functional redundancy within the large chitinase and glucanase gene families found in most fungi . Yet , even in strains which do demonstrate morphogenic defects upon gene deletion ( e . g . SUN proteins ) , the relationship between hydrolysis and morphogenesis is poorly understood . Further in - vestigations are therefore required to determine the relationship between polysaccharide hydrolysis and cellular morphogenesis . Fungal chitosanases Chitosanases ( EC 3 . 2 . 1 . 132 ) have been discovered and characterized in a broad range of organisms , including bacteria , plants and fungi ( Thadathil and Velappan , 2014 ) . They can be classi(cid:12)ed , according to sequence similarity , into (cid:12)ve glycosyl hydrolase ( GH ) fam - ilies : GH5 , GH8 , GH46 , GH75 and GH80 ( Hoell et al . , 2010 ) . However , all fungal chitosanases ( CSN ) characterized so far belong to the GH75 family , and are endo - type 151 chitosanases . Chitosanases can be further classi(cid:12)ed according to their substrate speci - (cid:12)city : Class II enzymes are only able to hydrolyze a bond between two b 1 , 4 - linked glu - cosamine residues ( GlcN - GlcN ) , whereas Class I and III enzymes are also able to hy - drolyze b 1 , 4 - linkages between GlcNAc and GlcN residues ( Fukamizo et al . , 1994 ) . Exo - b - D - glucosaminidases ( EC 3 . 2 . 1 . 165 ) are also able to hydrolyze chitosan , although in this case individual glucosamine residues are cleaved from the non - reducing end of chitosan chains . Although the structures and catalytic mechanisms have been determined for a num - ber of bacterial chitosanases ( reviewed in Hoell et al . ( 2010 ) ) , similar studies of fungal chitosanase are extremely limited . In A . fumigatus , a chitosanase was characterized as a class I CSN , and a pair of key catalytic residues ( D160 and E169 ) identi(cid:12)ed ( Cheng et al . , 2006 ) . Chitosanases from Penicillium spp . ( Rodr(cid:19)(cid:16)guez - Mart(cid:19)(cid:16)n et al . , 2010 ; Zhu et al . , 2012 ) and A . oryzae ( Sugita et al . , 2012 ) have also been cloned and characterized . Data regarding the biological roles of fungal chitosanases is also scarce , especially in comparison with those characterizing the roles of chitinases and glucanases , as discussed previously . Deletion of the chitosanase CsnB in A . fumigatus had no e(cid:11)ect on vegetative growth or sporulation , although was required for growth on media containing chitosan as a carbon source ( Beck et al . , 2014 ) . Similarly , silencing of CSN1 in Fusarium solani also had no e(cid:11)ect on mycelial growth or sporulation , although reduced chitosanase activity was recorded . However , overexpression of CSN1 did result in reduced mycelial growth and virulence , although the reason for this e(cid:11)ect was not investigated ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Chitin deacetylation has not been investigated in any of the organisms in which chi - tosanases have been characterized , and vice versa . Therefore , these aforementioned stud - ies lack any frame of reference . Indeed , it is di(cid:14)cult to determine the role of a chitosanase without (cid:12)rst having prior knowledge of when and where chitosan is synthesized during the life - cycle of the fungus . In this thesis , chitosan has already been shown to play a critical role in appressorium development ( Chapter 3 ) , and to be a component of the cell wall during hyphal growth ( Chapter 4 ) . In light of these data , and given the general paucity of data regarding the biological roles of fungal chitosanases , it would seem opportune to use M . oryzae as an organism to elucidate the role of chitosanases . In doing so , this could result in a further insight into the role of cell wall hydrolases in general . The added ben - 152 e(cid:12)t of characterizing chitosanases is that fungi contain far fewer genes encoding putative chitosanases than they do chitinases or glucanases . Redundancy is therefore much less likely to complicate the characterization of this enzyme . 5 . 2 Results A single chitosanase is present in M . oryzae In order to determine the number of putative chitosanase genes in the M . oryzae , the A . fumigatus Csn protein sequence ( Genbank AAO41660 . 1 ) ( Cheng et al . , 2006 ) was used as a BLAST query against the M . oryzae protein database ( Broad Institute ) . This iden - ti(cid:12)ed just a single putative chitosanase : MGG07656 . Further BLAST searches of the protein database using MGG07656 as a query and Pfam domain searches to (cid:12)nd addi - tional proteins with a GH75 domain ( Pfam 07335 ) failed to identify further chitosanase sequences . Therefore , M . oryzae has just a single putative chitosanase ( Csn ) in its genome . The MGG07656 CSN gene is 2579 nt in length , with two introns , and encodes a pro - tein of 797 aa . This is signi(cid:12)cantly longer than all other chitosanase sequences , which are typically 250 - 350 aa in length . Closer inspection of the predicted protein sequence reveals that in addition to an N - terminal signal peptide ( SignalP 4 . 0 ) and a chitosanase domain ( Pfam 07335 ) , the C - terminal (cid:24) 450 aa are almost entirely composed of short repeats rich in proline ( P ) , aspartate ( D ) and lysine ( K ) residues ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . These are interspersed with short repeated linker sequences : Two copies of DSLKMETSGGTKDNGDMGE , and three copies of KPKLSPQGFEIIDPMAKDYNLWDKGLEGDGK ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . In order to con(cid:12)rm whether this sequence was correct , and not due to a misannotation , the gDNA was sequenced . The sequence obtained was identical to that in the genome database . Next , the cDNA was ampli(cid:12)ed , and sequenced . Again , this con(cid:12)rmed the presence of the repeats , and the absence of introns con(cid:12)rmed the sequence was from cDNA , and not gDNA ( not shown ) . Comparison of the M . oryzae Csn protein sequence with the those of all other Csn in other fungi ( Figure 5 . 2 ) suggests that the M . oryzae chitosanase is unique with regard to these repeat sequences . However , a BLAST search using these repeat sequences as a query revealed a number of bacterial cell wall proteins with similar repeat sequences , including BibA from Streptococcus agalactiae ( Santi et al . , 153 2007 ) , where the repeats are required for cell wall localization ( Janulczyk et al . , 2010 ) . Repeat sequences enriched in proline , aspartate and lysine residues are often intrinsically disordered ( Romero et al . , 2001 ) . To determine whether the C - terminal region of Csn is disordered , the sequence was analyzed by the PONDR ( Predictor of Natural Disordered Regions ) VL - XT and VLS2 algorithms ( www . pondr . com ) . VLS2 gives accurate whole - protein prediction of disorder ( Peng et al . , 2006 ) , and revealed that the entire C - terminal (cid:24) 500 aa of Csn is indeed likely to be disordered . VL - XT can be used to (cid:12)nd localized ordered regions within disordered proteins , with possible roles in protein - protein inter - actions ( Romero et al . , 2001 ; Cortese et al . , 2008 ) . This algorithm revealed that there are several short ordered regions within the general disorder of the C - terminal region . These regions correspond to the three repeats of KPKLSPQGFEIIDPMAKDYNLWD - KGLEGDGK as described above ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . Alignment of chitosanase sequences from a number of fungi ( Figure 5 . 1 ) shows that the key catalytic residues ( aspartate and glutamate ) , as identi(cid:12)ed by Cheng et al . ( 2006 ) are conserved , suggesting that the M . oryzae Csn is a functional endo - chitosanase . Chitosanases are restricted to the Pezizomycotina Chitin deacetylases are present in all fungi , as discussed previously . To determine whether this is also true of chitosanases , a reciprocal best - hits BLAST search was performed on the protein databases of all sequenced fungal genomes , using the M . oryzae Csn as a query sequence . This revealed that chitosanases are restricted to the Pezizomycotina subphy - lum ( Figure 5 . 2 ) ; no putative chitosanases were identi(cid:12)ed in any other subphylum of the Ascomycota , nor any phylum outside of the Ascomycota . Even within the Pezizomy - cotina , multiple , independent gene losses have apparently occurred ; no chitosanase was identi(cid:12)ed in Magnaporthe poae , nor in the Ajellomycetaceae or Helotiales , to name but a few . In most of those species with putative chitosanases , just a single sequence was present . Aspergillus sp . were an exception , with four , as discovered previously ( Cheng et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , the distribution and number of chitosanases does not mirror that of the chitin deacetylases . This suggests that the hydrolysis of chitosan may not be necessary in all fungi . 154 Figure 5 . 1 : Magnaporthe oryzae has a single gene encoding chitosanase ( CSN ) . A ) Protein domain architecture of CSN , comprising a signal peptide , Glycosyl Hydrolase 75 domain ( chitosanase ) and a long section of proline , aspartate and lysine ( PDK ) rich repeats at the C - terminus ( shown in B ) .

C ) Alignment of fungal chitosanases , showing conservation of key catalytic aspartate and glutamate residues ( green boxes ) . D ) Prediction of protein disorder using PONDR VSL2 ( purple line ) and VL - XT ( red line ) . 155 Figure 5 . 2 : Chitosanases are restricted to the Pezizomycotina . Most species in the Pezizomycotina have 1 - 4 genes encoding putative chitosanases , although apparent gene losses have occurred in some lineages ( highlighted in red ) . Chitosanases are absent in all other phyla , including the basidiomycota , chytridiomycota ( not shown ) and zygomycota ( not shown ) . 156 Deletion of CSN To determine the role of CSN in M . oryzae , the gene was deleted by targeted gene replace - ment , as described in previous Chapters . In this case , the entire deletion cassette could not be synthesized with the requisite purity . Instead , it was synthesized in two halves , each with the antibiotic resistance gene ( BAR ) , and a sequence homologous to that (cid:13)anking CSN ( Figure 5 . 3A ) . This was transformed into both the Guy11 and ku70 back - ground strains . ku70 is the deletion strain of KU70 , encoding a protein involved in the non - homologous end - joining ( NHEJ ) pathway , and demonstrates vastly improved gene targeting e(cid:14)ciency ( Villalba et al . , 2008 ) . Following successful transformation , transfor - mants were (cid:12)rst screened by PCR , to identify those in which CSN had been successfully replaced by BAR ( not shown ) . Putative deletion strains were subjected to Southern blot analysis , to con(cid:12)rm the presence of a single copy of the deletion cassette at the desired locus . Pst I digestion of gDNA from putative deletion strains was hybridised with a - 32 P - labelled BAR , and resulted in the expected 3 . 8 kb band in all of the lines made in the ku70 background , and four of the lines in the Guy11 background ( Figure 5 . 3B ) . No hybridisation was observed in the WT ( Guy11 ) lane , con(cid:12)rming the speci(cid:12)city of the hybridisation . Two independent deletion lines in the Guy11 background strain were chosen for characterization ( named 9 and 46 ) . Phenotypic characterization of csn mutants Chitosan was previously found to be a component of the cell wall in vegetative hyphae ( Chapter 4 ) . To determine whether the deletion of CSN impacted hyphal growth , the csn mutants were subjected to radial growth assays on solid media . A range of stress conditions were applied , including nutritional stress ( nitrogen or carbon starvation ) , cell wall perturbants ( Calco(cid:13)uor White , Congo Red ) , membrane perturbant ( SDS ) , metal ( copper ) and osmotic stress ( sorbitol and NaCl ) ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . Although very small , yet statistically signi(cid:12)cant ( Student’s T - test p < 0 . 01 ) di(cid:11)erences in growth between the WT and csn strains were found , the biological signi(cid:12)cance of this is questionable , as they generally represent < 10 % change in growth . This is particularly apparent if one compares these results with those from Figure 5 . 9 , which show similar growth di(cid:11)erences in the empty vector strains . These small changes in growth in the csn strains are therefore 157 Figure 5 . 3 : Targeted deletion of CSN . The gene encoding CSN was replaced by a gene imparting resistance to bialaphos ( BAR ) . In this instance , the deletion cassette was split into two parts , each with the resistance gene , and a sequence homologous to either the 5’ or 3’ (cid:13)anking sequence of CSN ( A ) . B ) Southern blot showing successful deletion of CSN in both the Guy11 and Ku70 backgrounds . Restriction digested ( Pst I ) gDNA of putative deletion strains was hybridised with a - 32 P labelled DNA homologous to BAR . Size markers show band size in kilobases ( Kb ) . 158 likely due to ‘cryptic’ alterations occurring during the transformation process , and suggest that Csn is not required for growth or morphogenesis in vegetative hyphae . In future , ectopic insertion lines or complemented strains should be included in radial growth assays . In A . fumigatus , deletion of CsnB resulted in reduced growth on media containing chitosan ( Beck et al . , 2014 ) . To see if this was also true of the csn mutant in M . oryzae , growth assays with chitosan as a carbon source were performed on solid and in liquid medium ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . On solid medium containing 0 . 5 % chitosan ( w / v ) , equal growth was observed in all strains after a 14 day incubation . In some fungi , a ‘halo’ indicative of substrate degradation is also observed around fungal colonies grown on chitosan ( Palma - Guerrero et al . , 2008 ) , but this was not observed for M . oryzae . In liquid medium , chitosan was clearly able to be used as a carbon source , since biomass was much higher in (cid:13)asks containing 0 . 33 % chitosan ( w / v ) ( and 16 . 6 mM sodium acetate ) than those containing sodium acetate alone . However , the biomass of the csn mutant was identical to the WT strain . Cell wall hydrolases have previously been implicated in autolysis under starvation conditions . To determine whether Csn is required for autolysis , equal concentrations of conidia were inoculated into (cid:13)asks containing minimal media , and incubated for up to 30 days , with biomass measurements taken every 4 days after an initial 5 day incubation . Biomass increased up to 17 dpi , then decreased between 21 and 30 dpi , suggesting the onset of autolysis ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . Similar decreases in biomass were observed in the WT and csn strains , suggesting that chitosanase is not required for autolysis . It was also hypothesized that chitosanase may be required for turnover or remodelling of chitosan in the cell wall . To determine whether the amount and distribution of chitosan in the cell wall is altered in the csn mutant , chitosan was localized in hyphae , appres - soria and conidia . In hyphae stained with OGA488 no changes in labelling intensity or localization were observed in csn compared with the WT ( Figure 5 . 5 ) . Similarly , anti - chitosan antibody labelling of germlings or eosin Y labelling of conidia also failed to show any di(cid:11)erences between the WT and csn strains . It therefore appears that large - scale changes in cell wall composition have not occurred as a result of CSN deletion . The cell walls of appressoria and invasive hyphae appear to have a particularly high chitosan content ( Fujikawa et al . , 2009 ) . In order to determine whether Csn is required for 159 Figure 5 . 4 : The csn mutant shows normal growth under a range of conditions .

A mock inoculation of 0 . 2 % gelatine was included as a negative control . Error bars show SD , n = 3 . morphogenesis in these structures , conidial germination , appressorium development and pathogenicity were evaluated . Germination and appressorium development on an arti(cid:12)cial hydrophobic surface were una(cid:11)ected in the csn mutant at all time - points ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . Conidia of csn inoculated onto barley leaves also resulted in similar lesion densities to the WT ( Figure 5 . 6 ) , with identical results obtained on rice leaves ( not shown ) . Morphology of invasive hyphae in onion epidermis was also una(cid:11)ected in the csn mutant ( not shown ) . Promoter analysis of CSN The lack of any phenotype in the csn mutant was unexpected , and did not give any information regarding the role of chitosanase . To determine the localization of Csn , an eGFP fusion was created . Primers 55 and 56 ( Appendix E ) were used to amplify the open reading frame of CSN ( without the stop codon ) , together with 1 . 7kb of 5’ promoter sequence ( for native expression of the construct ) . This was cloned into the Asc I and Sbf I sites of the pUCAP vector ( Appendix D ) , thereby creating a C - terminal eGFP fusion . After transformation into the csn background strain , antibiotic - resistant transformants 162 were screened for (cid:13)uorescence . A number of (cid:13)uorescent lines were isolated ( listed in Appendix F ) , and characterized . CSN : eGFP strains demonstrated weak (cid:13)uorescence in vegetative hyphae , particularly in those at the colony margins , and occasionally in conidia . However , this (cid:13)uorescence appeared to be localized to the cytoplasm , rather than associated with the cell wall as expected ( Figure 5 . 7A ) . No (cid:13)uorescence was observed at any other stage of the life - cycle , including during appressorium development , or in planta growth . Western blot analysis of the Csn : eGFP fusion using an anti - eGFP antibody was unsuccessful ; no speci(cid:12)c bands were detected , so it is not known whether the (cid:13)uorescence is associated with the intact fusion protein , or a degradation product . To determine whether the cytoplasmic (cid:13)uores - cence was due to a mislocalization of the fusion protein , additional fusion constructs were tested . Firstly , eGFP was fused to a truncated form of CSN ( aa1 - 348 ) , which lacked the C - terminal repeat region ( ampli(cid:12)ed with primers 55 and 57 ( Appendix E ) ) . However , transformants carrying this construct did not demonstrate any (cid:13)uorescence at all . Next , an internal eGFP fusion was attempted , of both the full length and truncated CSN . Here , eGFP was cloned after the Csn signal peptide , such that it would be at the N - terminus of the mature protein . Again , however , no (cid:13)uorescence was detected in the resulting transformants . Because (cid:13)uorescence from the eGFP fusion construct was weak and potentially mislo - calized , it could only provide limited information regarding the role of Csn . By fusing the promoter of CSN to three copies of YFPvenus , more sensitive information regarding spa - tial and temporal expression of CSN could be obtained . Primer pairs 62 / 63 , 64 / 65 and 66 / 67 ( Appendix E ) were used to amplify three copies of YFPvenus , which were cloned between the Asc I and Bam HI site of the pUCAP vector ( Appendix D ) . pCSN was am - pli(cid:12)ed with primers 68 and 69 , and cloned into the newly - created Xho I site 5’ of the (cid:12)rst YFPvenus , thus completing the promoter fusion . This construct was transformed into the WT background strain , and antibiotic resistant colonies were screened for (cid:13)uorescence . A number of independent lines were chosen for characterization ( listed in Appendix F ) . As with the CSN : eGFP strains , YFP (cid:13)uorescence was observed in vegetative hyphae , and was strongest in those at the colony margins ( Figure 5 . 7B ) . Additionally , (cid:13)uorescence was also observed in appressoria post - penetration ( (cid:24) 48 hpi ) , but not in invasive hyphae , 163 Figure 5 . 7 : CSN is expressed in vegetative hyphae .

Scale bars : as stated in pictures . nor during appressorium development ( Figure 5 . 7B ) . Taken together , these data suggest that Csn is involved in vegetative growth rather than pathogenic development . Overexpression of CSN The deletion of CSN had no discernible e(cid:11)ect on growth or development in M . oryzae . In a further attempt to characterize the role of chitosan hydrolysis , CSN was overex - pressed . The RP27 promoter ( as used for ectopic expression of CBP1 in Chapter 3 ) was ampli(cid:12)ed with primers 70 and 71 ( Appendix E ) . The full and truncated ( aa1 - 275 ) forms of Csn were ampli(cid:12)ed with primer pairs 72 / 73 and 72 / 74 respectively , then fused to 164 Figure 5 . 8 : Overexpression of CSN . Semi - quantitative RT - PCR of CSN transcript , showing overexpression of both full and truncated ( residues 1 - 275 ) versions of CSN . pRP27 using primer pairs 70 / 73 and 70 / 74 . Finally , the pRP27 : CSN fusions were cloned into the pUCAP vector . The constructs were transformed into the WT background , and resulting bialaphos - resistant transformants were screened for CSN overexpression . Semi - quantitative RT - PCR was used to determine the transcript levels of CSN in mycelium after 72 hr growth in liquid CM . Primer pairs 104 / 105 and 106 / 107 were used to am - plify CSN and b - tubulin transcripts respectively . In the control strains ( WT and empty vector ) , only faint bands were detected , consistent with the low expression of CSN ob - served previously in the promoter fusion . However , several of the putative overexpressor lines demonstrated increased transcript abundance , suggesting that CSN was being suc - cessfully overexpressed ( Figure 5 . 8 ) . Ampli(cid:12)cation of non - reverse transcribed RNA ( - RT control ) did not result in visible bands , proving that ampli(cid:12)cation was from cDNA , and not gDNA contamination . Two independent lines overexpressing each construct ( full - length and truncated Csn ) were chosen for characterization , as well an empty vector line . In an attempt to also con(cid:12)rm that the increased transcript resulted in increased protein levels , two antibodies raised against CsnB in A . fumigatus ( Beck et al . , 2014 ) were used to detect the M . oryzae Csn . Unfortunately , Western blot analysis using these antibodies failed to detect Csn , suggesting a lack of cross - reactivity with this protein ( not shown ) . Phenotypic characterization of CSN overexpressors Radial growth of strains overexpressing CSN and CSN 1 - 275 was evaluated on solid media , as described previously for the CSN deletion strains . No di(cid:11)erences in radial growth were found in the overexpressors compared with the empty vector strain , although in several cases the empty vector strains did themselves demonstrate signi(cid:12)cantly di(cid:11)erent growth compared with the WT , particularly on plates containing hydrogen peroxide ( Figure 5 . 9 ) . 165 Thus , small but statistically signi(cid:12)cant di(cid:11)erences in growth characteristics can occur as a result of strains undergoing the transformation process , which must be taken into ac - count when evaluating the growth of transformants . Growth assays were also performed on media containing chitosan as a sole carbon source . Again , however , no di(cid:11)erences in growth were observed in the overexpressor strains , and colonies were identical in ap - pearance ( Figure 5 . 9 ) . In order to more directly measure chitosanase activity , mycelial protein extracts were incubated with chitosan , and reducing ends quanti(cid:12)ed using dini - trosalicylic acid . No chitosanase activity was detected in protein extracts from the WT or overexpressing strains , although chitosanase from a commercial source ( Sigma ) did demonstrate activity in the same assay . This suggests that either chitosanase activity in the extracts was too low , or conditions were not correct . To determine whether the amount or distribution of chitosan in the cell wall was altered by overexpression of Csn , germlings were labelled with the anti - chitosan antibody mAbG7 . No changes in labelling were observed in the overexpressor strains ; only the germ tubes and appressoria showed antibody labelling , just as in the WT and empty vector strains . Additionally , germling morphology was also una(cid:11)ected . Lastly , pathogenicity of the overexpressing strains was evaluated . Rice leaves were inoculated with equal concentrations of conidia , and lesions observed after a 4 day in - cubation . Leaves inoculated with conidia of the overexpressing strains demonstrated similar lesion density to the WT and empty vector strains ( Figure 5 . 11 ) , suggesting that overexpression of Csn had no e(cid:11)ect on pathogenicity . Microscopic observations of onion epidermises inoculated with conidia also revealed that morphology and growth of invasive hyphae was una(cid:11)ected in the overexpressor strains ( not shown ) . 166 Figure 5 . 9 : Radial growth on solid media is una(cid:11)ected in CSN overexpressing strains .

In particular , the hydrolysis of cell wall components has long been hypothesized to be required for cellular morpho - genesis . However , evidence for this hypothesis is distinctly lacking and a link between cell wall hydrolysis and processes such as hyphal branching or tip - growth has yet to be demonstrated . In order to improve our understanding of cell wall hydrolysis , the role of chitosanase in M . oryzae was investigated . Most cell wall hydrolysing enzymes , such as chitinases or glucanases , occur in large gene families which make characterization problematic . Functional redundancy within these families often results in compensatory responses when a gene is deleted , thereby preventing the detection of a phenotype . Fortunately , chitosanases are usually present in a single copy in the genomes of most fungi , including that of M . oryzae . The sole chitosanase present in M . oryzae appears to be unique , due to the presence of a large section of intrinsically disordered C - terminal repeats . The function of these repeats was not determined in the present study ; overexpression of a truncated form of Csn did not show any phenotype , and an eGFP fusion could not be localized . In addition , given the abundance of proteins with intrinsically disordered regions ( estimated at up to 50 % of eukaryotic proteins ( Dunker et al . , 2000 ) ) , the presence of this region in Csn does not in itself give any clue as to its function . Nevertheless , the presence of similar repeats in other proteins allows speculation as to their role . A number of bacterial cell wall proteins , including BibA from Streptococcus agalactiae ( Santi et al . , 2007 ) , have similar repeats which are required for cell wall localization ( Janulczyk et al . , 2010 ) . It is therefore possible that these repeats act as a chitosan - binding or general cell wall - binding domain . Chitosan has been demonstrated to be a cell wall component in appressoria , invasion hyphae and vegetative hyphae in M . oryzae , but deletion of Csn had no e(cid:11)ects on growth or morphogenesis in any of these cell - types . In light of the expression pattern of CSN however , these data are perhaps not so surprising . Unexpectedly , promoter activity for CSN and was not detected during appressorium development or in planta growth , and only low expression was found in vegetative hyphae . Taken together , it appears that Csn is neither involved in , nor required for , cellular morphogenesis in cell - types with chitosan - rich cell walls . This is consistent with (cid:12)ndings in A . fumigatus ( Beck et al . , 169 2014 ) , F . solani ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) and N . crassa ( Maddi et al . , 2012 ) , where deletion or knockdown of chitosanases had no e(cid:11)ect on vegetative growth or conidiation . There are two possible reasons why chitosanases may not be required for morphogenesis . Firstly , chitosan is hypothesized to be an inherently (cid:13)exible cell wall component . As such , hy - drolysis would not be necessary to render it pliable in the same way as a component such as chitin , for example . Secondly , although there is but a single chitosanase enzyme in M . oryzae , this does not necessarily mean that it is the only one with chitosanase activity ; both chitosanases and chitinases are able to hydrolyse bonds between GlcN and GlcNAc residues ( Hartl et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , chitinases are also able to hydrolyse chitosan , although this is dependant upon degree of deacetylation , since they are not able to hydrolyse bonds between two GlcN residues , unlike chitosanase . It may therefore be chitinases that are required for chitosan hydrolysis during morphogenesis . The potential redundancy between chitosanase and chitinases may also explain a num - ber of other observations made in this study , including the fact that many fungi , including close relatives of M . oryzae , lack any chitosanase sequences at all . Of course , this could also re(cid:13)ect di(cid:11)erences in cell wall chitosan content or localization . Investigations of chitin deacetylation in other fungal species will be required to answer these questions . Secreted chitinases may have also been responsible for supporting growth on media containing chitosan as a sole carbon source in the csn mutants ; the chitosan used had a degree of deacetylation of 75 - 85 % , making it susceptible to chitinase activity . Hydrolysis of chi - tosan during autolysis may also be carried out by chitinases , thus explaining the lack of delay in the onset of autolysis in the csn mutants . However , this could also be a re(cid:13)ection of the relatively low chitosan content in hyphal walls ; the failure to degrade this would not be expected to cause a signi(cid:12)cant delay in autolysis . In light of these negative results , it is di(cid:14)cult to ascertain the role of chitosanase . The Csn : eGFP construct localized to the cytoplasm , rather than the cell wall as expected . This may not necessarily be incorrect , but without a phenotype to complement , this is impossible to determine . Certain hydrolytic enzymes involved in cell - fusion do demon - strate cytoplasmic localization : In S . pombe , all 7 glucanase : GFP fusions demonstrated intracellular (cid:13)uorescence , despite the presence of signal peptides in some of these proteins ( e . g . Agn1 ) ( Dudin et al . , 2015 ) . These proteins were only recruited to the cell wall at 170 the point of fusion . It is therefore possible that Csn may be recruited to the cell wall during hyphal fusion . Unfortunately , such fusion events proved di(cid:14)cult to observe in M . oryzae , due to the extremely high density of hyphae . Cytoplasmic localization would also explain the lack of phenotype observed during overexpression of CSN . The accumu - lation of abnormal concentrations of Csn intracellularly would not cause any loss of cell wall integrity , nor any increase in growth on media containing chitosan as a sole carbon source . Further investigations are required to determine the true location and role of Csn . For example , it may be informative to determine whether Csn has a role in antagonistic interactions in M . oryzae , or perhaps to characterize stages of the life - cycle not examine here , such as sexual reproduction or microconidiation . 5 . 4 Conclusions There remain many unanswered questions regarding the role of chitosan hydrolysis in M . oryzae . Firstly , it is questionable whether the hydrolysis of chitosan is even required during morphogenesis , and if it is , it appears that Csn is not involved in this process . Other enzymes , such as chitinases , may be responsible instead . Secondly , the subcellular location of Csn is unknown , and it is possible that Csn remains intracellular until recruited to the cell wall during particular processes such as hyphal fusion . Investigating chitosan hydrolysis has therefore not resulted in any further insights into the roles of cell wall hydrolysis in fungi . This serves as a reminder that the cell wall is an incredibly complex structure , and a process as apparently simple as the hydrolysis of a polysaccharide could have numerous , ‘cryptic’ roles in the lifecycle of a fungus . 171 Chapter 6 General discussion and further work 172 6 . 1 General Discussion Chitin deacetylases ( EC 3 . 5 . 1 . 41 ) are a family of carbohydrate esterase enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of an N - acetamido group in the N - acetylglucosamine residues of chitin , resulting in deacetylation . Chitin deacetylases are present in all fungi , although the role of these enzymes had only been characterized in four species prior to this study : Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Schizosaccharomyces pombe , Ashbya gossypii and Cryptococ - cus neoformans . Chitosan is a structural component of the ascospore wall in S . cerevisiae ( Christodoulidou et al . , 1996 ) and S . pombe ( Matsuo et al . , 2005 ) , is required for spore development in A . gossypii ( Lickfeld and Schmitz , 2012 ) , and is a major component of the cell wall in the vegetative cells of C . neoformans ( Baker et al . , 2007 ) . Clearly , chitosan has di(cid:11)erent roles in fungi depending on the cell - type or species in question . The investigation of chitin deacetylation in M . oryzae provided further evidence for the multifaceted nature of chitosan . At least 3 CDAs are involved in chitin deacetylation during appressorium de - velopment . Unexpectedly , chitosan was not required for morphogenesis , but was required for germling adhesion and surface sensing . In the current model , chitosan is required for activation of the Pmk1 and cAMP pathways , although the exact mechanism behind this is unknown ( Figure 3 . 18 ) . In vegetative hyphae , chitosan was detected in both the sub - peripheral zone of colonies , and the colony interior . Two CDAs were responsible for chitin deacetylation in these locations , each with apparently distinct deacetylation mechanisms and expression patterns . The role of chitin deacetylation in these cell - types was unclear , but is associated with hyphal maturation and may play a role in altering properties of the cell wall , such as permeability . The roles of the other 5 CDAs remain unknown . In a previous study , a deletion strain of MGG05023 ( CDA7 ) was made , but displayed no defects in pathogenic development ( Mochizuki et al . , 2011 ) . The uncharacterised CDAs are likely to operate at stages of the life - cycle which were not studied here , for example during in planta growth , sexual reproduction and microconidiation . Chitin deacetylation during in planta growth is of particular interest , as the cell walls of invasive hyphae in M . oryzae are known to contain chitosan ( Fujikawa et al . , 2009 ) . It has been hypothesized that chitosan operates as a ‘stealth mechanism’ in phytopathogenic fungi . No conclusive evidence was found for this in appressoria , but this hypothesis was not tested during in planta development , which would perhaps have been more insightful since in planta 173 hyphae are fully exposed to the defence mechanisms of the rice plant . Recently published transcriptomic analysis of rice infected with M . oryzae identi(cid:12)ed three CDAs that are expressed in planta : MGG12939 ( CBP1 ) , MGG04172 ( CDA3 ) and MGG08356 ( CDA6 ) ( Dong et al . , 2015 ) . In this study , the cbp1 / cda3 mutant was fully pathogenic , although localization of chitosan in the invasive hyphae was not performed . Deletion and mCherry fusion of MGG08356 were in fact also attempted during the course of this project . Un - fortunately , no putative deletion lines were obtained , and no (cid:13)uorescence was observed in the mCherry fusions . Further investigations are therefore required to determine the role of chitosan during in planta growth , which would perhaps require the generation of a triple cbp1 / cda3 / cda6 mutant . This would also help to determine whether chitin deacety - lases represent a valuable fungicide target in M . oryzae . Based on current evidence , the chemical inhibition of chitin deacetylation would not have any protective e(cid:11)ect against rice blast disease . Chitin deacetylation and chitosan hydrolysis were hypothesized to be important for increasing cell wall (cid:13)exibility during cellular morphogenesis . However , the evidence pre - sented in this thesis strongly suggests that this is not the case . Appressorium develop - ment , hyphal branching and hyphal extension all occurred normally in the absence of chitosan in the cda and csn mutants , and ectopic expression of either Cda1 : mCherry or Cbp1 : mCherry did not result in any morphogenic defects . In addition , localization of chi - tosan with OGA488 did not provide evidence for a role in morphogenesis , since labelling was not found to be speci(cid:12)c to cell - types or subcellular locations undergoing morphogen - esis . This is consistent with previous studies regarding the role of chitin deacetylation : Chitosan was not detected during vegetative growth of S . cerevisiae ( Christodoulidou et al . , 1996 ) , and deletion of the sole chitin deacetylase in A . gossypii did not alter (cid:12)la - mentous growth of the fungus ( Lickfeld and Schmitz , 2012 ) . Although it remains possible that chitin deacetylation results in a change in the physical properties of the cell wall , the relationship between cell wall dynamics and morphogenesis is much more complex than a change in a single cell wall component . Several concurrent changes in cell wall composi - tion are most likely required during morphogenesis , including de novo cell wall synthesis , cell wall hydrolysis , alterations in the inter - relationships of di(cid:11)erent cell wall components , as well as re - organization of intracellular components , such as septins . As a relatively 174 simple example , morphogenesis at the bud neck in S . cerevisiae is controlled by the chitin ring ( synthesized by Chs3 ) , the linkage of this chitin to b 1 , 3 - glucan ( by the transglyco - sylases Crh1 and Crh2 ) , and the septin complex . Interestingly , the septin complex and chitin ring appear to have redundant functions in controlling bud neck growth ( Cabib and Arroyo , 2013 ) . Thus , one can imagine that the changes in cell - shape or morphogenesis of the various di(cid:11)erent cell - types during the life - cycle of a fungus such as M . oryzae requires the coordination of a large number of processes , some of which may exhibit redundancy . Future investigations in this area should therefore take a holistic view of these processes , rather than considering each in isolation . Although not required for morphogenesis , it is clear that chitin deacetylation is associated with a remarkably diverse set of processes , including cellular development , pathogenic interactions and maintenance of cell wall integrity . For example , within M . oryzae chitosan was found to have di(cid:11)erent roles according to the developmental stage in question ( i . e . germlings vs . vegatative hyphae ) . This raises the question of how a single polysaccharide can have such apparently disparate roles . The answer to this may lie in the interactions of chitosan with other cell wall components : its relationship with the rest of the cell wall may di(cid:11)er according to the developmental stage or cell - type in question . Unlike other cell wall polysaccharides , the primary amine groups of chitosan may allow it to form unique ionic or covalent interactions with other cell wall components . This could result in signi(cid:12)cant changes to the chemical or physical properties of the cell wall at particular subcellular locations or developmental stages . There is some evidence for this in germlings , where chitosan may form a polyelectrolyte complex with an anionic moiety , possibly polygalacturonic acid ( PGA ) . This relationship may be critical for sur - face sensing in germlings , and merits further investigation . In vegetative hyphae , only extremely low levels of PGA were detected , and showed an entirely di(cid:11)erent distribution to chitosan , suggesting that the putative polyelectrolyte complex does not exist in hyphal walls . Further work is required to determine the interactions of chitosan with other cell wall components , and to establish whether this property is unique to chitosan . The work presented in this thesis has established novel biological roles for chitosan . In addition , novel mechanistic aspects of chitin deacetylation have also been discovered . Prior to this study , the localization of chitin deacetylases had never been investigated . 175 However , through the use of (cid:13)uorescent CDA fusions both alone and in combination with chitin synthases , a number of novel and potentially signi(cid:12)cant aspects of chitin deacety - lation were revealed . Firstly , the timing of chitin deacetylation may be an important de - terminant of the properties of the resulting chitosan . Cbp1 : mCherry and Cda2 : mCherry colocalized with Chs7 : 2xYFP during germ tube hooking and appressorium development , and Cda4 : mCherry may colocalize with a chitin synthase during hyphal growth . The proximity of the enzymes or even their physical association may result in the complete deacetylation of nascent chitin chains . Conversely , colocalization of Cbp1 : mCherry and Cda2 : mCherry with Chs7 : 2xYFP was not observed at the lateral walls of the germ tube , or at the upper , domed part of the appressorium . In addition , Cda1 : mCherry was only observed in mature hyphae , where chitin synthesis may not be occurring . The action of chitin deacetylases on non - nascent chitin ( which may be crystalline ) may result in only partial deacetylation , due to the inaccessibility of the substrate . Therefore , the mode of chitin deacetylation could have profound e(cid:11)ects on the properties of the resulting chi - tosan , and may re(cid:13)ect di(cid:11)erent roles of the chitosan according to cell - type or subcellular location . Data from the colocalization studies also suggests that the potential coordi - nation between chitin synthesis and deacetylation may extend to the transport of these enzymes . In S . cerevisiae , Chs3 is known to cycle between the plasma membrane and intracellular trans - golgi / early endosomal compartments ( Chuang and Schekman , 1996 ; Ziman et al . , 1996 ) . Colocalization of Cbp1 : mCherry with Chs7 : 2xYFP was observed in intracellular bodies in germ tubes and appressoria , which may also represent an intra - cellular store of chitin synthase / deacetylase , from which transport of both enzymes to the plasma membrane can occur . In vegetative hyphae , the intracellular localization of Cda4 : mCherry also suggested possible colocalization with a chitin synthase , although this was not con(cid:12)rmed . Clearly , the coordination between chitin synthesis and deacetylation is an area which merits further investigation ( see ‘Further work’ ) . The investigation of chitin deacetylation and chitosan hydrolysis has also served to demonstrate the extreme complexity of the cell wall , and the limitations of our current understanding of it . In part , this lack of understanding arises from the remarkable di - versity in form and function demonstrated by the fungal cell wall , both between di(cid:11)erent cell - types within a single species and between di(cid:11)erent species of fungi . A single cell 176 wall component , such as chitosan or a 1 , 3 - glucan , can be required for diverse processes depending on the species or developmental stage in question . Such diversity makes it di(cid:14)cult to predict the role of a cell wall component based on data obtained from other fungi or cell - types - the requirement for CDAs during surface sensing in the germlings of M . oryzae could not have been predicted based on the previous characterization of Cda1 in A . gossypii , for example . Similarly , the role of chitosan in the vegetative hyphae of M . oryzae could not have been predicted by the characterization of chitin deacetylation in germlings . This makes it impossible to create an all - encompassing model for the struc - ture and function of the cell wall . However , it also reveals an important aspect of the cell wall , which is its functional plasticity . It appears that fungi have evolved a number of di(cid:11)erent strategies by which the cell wall can maintain cellular integrity in the face of biotic and abiotic stress , whilst also in(cid:13)uencing cellular morphogenesis and physical or biological interactions . The deacetylation of chitin appears to be one such strategy , which has been adapted to ful(cid:12)l di(cid:11)erent tasks depending on the species of fungus or developmental stage in question . 177 6 . 2 Further work As outlined above , there are several aspects of this project which merit further investi - gation . These are detailed below : Chitosan - mediated surface sensing A key (cid:12)nding of this thesis was the requirement for chitosan in surface sensing during germling morphogenesis . However , the precise mechanism behind this was not eluci - dated . The (cid:12)rst step in investigating this problem would be to determine the activation status of the Pmk1 and cAMP regulatory pathways in the cda mutants . This can be achieved relatively simply , using the Phosphoplus R (cid:13) p44 / 42 MAPK antibody ( Cell Signal - ing Technology R (cid:13) ) to speci(cid:12)cally detect the phosphorylation status of Pmk1 ( Zhao et al . , 2005 ) , and ELISA based protocols to quantify cAMP concentrations . This would reveal whether chitosan is required for the activation of just one , or both of these pathways . The main di(cid:14)culty in these experiments would be the collection of su(cid:14)cient quantities of germling tissue for the analysis . Determining why chitosan is required for pathway activation is more challenging . As discussed previously ( Chapter 3 , Section 3 . 3 ) , there are three main hypotheses of how chitosan may mediate surface sensing . The (cid:12)rst hypothesis concerns the putative direct linkage between chitosan and proteins involved in surface sensing . One way to investigate this hypothesis might be to identify the proteins which are in contact with the chitosan during germling morphogenesis . Exogenous FITC - labelled chitosan was shown to be incorporated into the cell wall in germlings of CDA deletion strains . By instead labelling the exogenous chitosan with an amine / sulphydryl - reactive photoa(cid:14)nity cross - linker , any proteins within the immediate vicinity of chitosan in the cell wall could be cross - linked , isolated , and identi(cid:12)ed by mass spectrometry . This could identify novel proteins involved in surface sensing or surface adhesion , as well as possibly con(cid:12)rming the putative interaction of chitosan with previously identi(cid:12)ed proteins such as the mucin Msb2 . Such an approach would require rigorous preliminary testing to optimise the cross - linking protocol , which would involve testing of di(cid:11)erent cross - linking agents and experimental conditions . Any proteins identi(cid:12)ed by this method could then be tested for their involvement in surface sensing or adhesion by gene - deletion or (cid:13)uorescent - labelling . 178 The second hypothesis concerns the possible role of chitosan in imparting the cell wall with the physical properties required to allow surface sensing through mechanical deformation . Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) could be used to determine elasticity of the germ tube cell wall in WT and cda strains . However , linking this with the activation of membrane proteins would be more challenging . Chachisvilis et al . ( 2006 ) used a FRET - based approach to monitor conformational changes in a mammalian GPCR . Potentially , this could be applied to the GPCR Pth11 in M . oryzae , to monitor conformational changes in the WT and cda strains on di(cid:11)erent surfaces . The third and (cid:12)nal hypothesis is that chitosan directly mediates germling adhesion . In this case , investigating the structure and surface characteristics of the germ tube cell wall in WT and cda strains in the presence or absence of exogenous chitosan could be in - formative . Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) could be used to determine the electrostatic charge and hydrophobicity of the germ tube cell wall ( Butt , 1991 ) , which may well be altered in the absence of chitosan and may in(cid:13)uence adhesion . Surface topography of the cell wall could also be determined with AFM , as could the localization of surface - exposed mannans and chitin , using tips functionalized with ConA or WGA - lectins respectively ( Alsteens et al . , 2008 ) . However , distinguishing between the direct e(cid:11)ects of chitosan on adhesion and those occurring as a result of signalling pathway activation would be di(cid:14)cult . One possible way to achieve this would be by arti(cid:12)cial pathway activation in the cda strain by chemical or genetic means . In this way , chitosan would remain absent , but the signalling pathways would still be activated . Germling adhesion and cell wall properties could then be examined in these strains . The role of chitin deacetylation during in planta development As described previously , investigating the role of chitin deacetylation during in planta development would require the creation of a cda6 mutant strain , and possibly cda3 / cda6 and cbp1 / cda3 / cda6 mutants . Once generated , the (cid:12)rst step would be to determine that chitin deacetylation had been reduced during in planta growth in the deletion strains . This would be simple to achieve , by using the chitosan - speci(cid:12)c probe OGA488 . Next , the pathogenicity of the deletion strains would be evaluated , and any di(cid:11)erences in plant defence response could be quanti(cid:12)ed by qPCR of pathogenesis - related ( PR ) 179 genes , callose staining with aniline blue and hydrogen peroxide staining with DAB ( 3 - 3’ - Diaminobenzidine ) . Co - ordination between chitin synthesis and deacetylation The relationship between chitin synthesis and deacetylation is one of the key areas which merits further investigation . Due to the tractability of germling morphogenesis as an experimental system and the preliminary data already obtained , investigating the rela - tionship between chitin synthase 7 and Cbp1 or Cda2 would likely be the most produc - tive approach . There are a number of di(cid:11)erent experiments which would be required to investigate this area . The (cid:12)rst thread of research would investigate the possibility of co - transportation of Chs7 and Cbp1 . To do this , the identity of the intracellular bodies ob - served when imaging the Chs7 : 2xYFP and Cbp1 : mCherry constructs ( Figure 3 . 7 ) should be determined . This could be achieved by using (cid:13)uorescently - tagged Rab5 , Rab7 and carboxypeptidase Y to identify the localization of early endosomes , late endosomes and vacuoles respectively ( Ramanujam et al . , 2013 ) , and to determine whether these colocal - ize with Chs7 : 2xYFP and Cbp1 : mCherry . Assuming the colocalization of these proteins , live cell imaging of germlings could then be used to follow the movement of these com - partments to and from the cell periphery . Endocytic recycling of Chs7 and Cbp1 could also be studied either via pharmacological inhibition ( e . g . Latrunculin A treatment ) or genetic disruption ( e . g . END4 deletion ) . The involvement of other proteins , such as the chitin synthase activators would also be of interest to pursue . The second thread of research would investigate the putative physical association between Chs7 and Cbp1 or Cda2 . This could be tested in a number of ways , including co - immunoprecipitation , pull - down assay , protein cross - linking , FRET ( Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer ) or BiFC ( Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation ) . These analyses could well identify other proteins which are part of a proposed chitin synthase - deacetylase complex . Cda4 was also hypothesized to colocalize with a chitin synthase in vegetative hyphae , but the enzyme in question was not identi(cid:12)ed . The localization of other chitin synthases ( Chs2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 ) therefore needs to be tested to determine whether they colocalize with Cda4 . Any putative co - transportation and protein - protein interactions can then be tested as described above . 180 The e(cid:11)ect of chitin deacetylation on the chemical and physical properties of the cell wall Chitin deacetylation is hypothesized to alter the chemical and physical properties of the cell wall . Investigating this hypothesis could be achieved by exploiting the existing deletion strains , and strains ectopically expressing chitin deacetylases . Quantifying the physical properties of the cell wall is relatively straight - forward , and could be achieved with AFM . This would determine whether reduced or ectopic chitin deacetylation results in altered cell wall elasticity . As discussed previously , AFM could also be used to produce high resolution topographical maps of the cell wall surface , quantify surface charge or hydrophobicity and to localize surface - exposed mannans and chitin . The chemical properties of chitosan ( e . g . degree of deacetylation ) and its interactions with other cell wall components would be far more challenging to deduce . It would perhaps be possible to once again exploit the incorporation of exogenous chitosan into the germ tube and appressorial cell walls . Once incorporated into the cell wall , the chitosan ( which could be labelled prior to incorporation ) may be able to be isolated and characterized by HPLC , mass spectrometry or NMR . This could help identify any covalent linkages between chitosan and other cell wall components . Fourier - Transform Infra - Red ( FT - IR ) spectroscopy could also be a valuable tool to determine the chemical composition of the cell wall in CDA deletion strains or those ectopically expressing CDA s . Polygalacturonic acid as a novel cell wall component Polygalacturonic acid ( PGA ) was tentatively identi(cid:12)ed as a component of the cell wall in the germlings of M . oryzae ( Chapter 3 ) . In order to further investigate this , the identity of PGA would (cid:12)rst need to be con(cid:12)rmed . The most e(cid:11)ective approach would be cell wall composition analysis by GC - MS ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) , although the main challenge with this method would be the collection of su(cid:14)cient germling tissue for the analysis ( (cid:24) 100mg dry weight required ) . Assuming that PGA is indeed a component of the cell wall , it would be of interest to investigate the role of this polysaccharide , especially given its putative relationship with chitosan . Unfortunately , in order to do this , the enzymes responsible for its synthesis need to (cid:12)rst be identi(cid:12)ed . As discussed previously ( Chapter 3 ) , the genome of M . oryzae does not appear to encode the enzymes required for galacturonic 181 acid synthesis . This suggests a non - conventional mechanism of synthesis . It is possible that galactose oxidase enzymes are required for oxidation of galactose residues in the cell wall . The genome of M . oryzae encodes two predicted secreted galactose oxidase en - zymes : MGG02368 and MGG10878 . One of these , MGG10878 , appears to be speci(cid:12)cally expressed during appressorium development ( Soanes et al . , 2012 ) . However , the oxidation of galactose by this enzyme would only produce galacto - hexodialdose , not galacturonic acid . Therefore , an additional oxidation step would be required . This may be performed by MGG05865 , which is annotated as a glyoxal oxidase . MGG05865 is a predicted se - creted protein , with 5 chitin binding domains , suggesting cell wall localization . It is also highly expressed during appressorium development , but not during vegetative growth ( Soanes et al . , 2012 ) . Glyoxal oxidase enzymes catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids , and so this could represent the (cid:12)nal step in the synthesis of galacturonic acid in the cell wall . Deletion of these identi(cid:12)ed genes would be necessary to test whether they are required for the synthesis of PGA . Previous studies characterizing the roles of galactose oxidase and glyoxal oxidase enzymes are few . Deletion of a membrane - bound glyoxal oxidase in Ustilago maydis resulted in defective cellular morphology and loss of pathogenicity ( Leuthner et al . , 2005 ) , and in Botrytis cinerea a deletion mutant for gly - oxal oxidase resulted in defects in conidial germination , hyphal growth and pathogenicity ( Van Kan et al . , 2004 ) . However , it is unclear exactly why deletion of these enzymes resulted in the observed phenotype and no link to galacturonic acid was investigated . 182 Bibliography Agrawal , G .
