The present studies tested if this involves activity - driven effects on the actin - regulatory protein cortactin , and if such effects are disturbed in the Fmr1 - knockout ( KO ) model of Fragile X Syndrome in which stabilization of both actin filaments and LTP is impaired . LTP induced by theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) in hippocampal slices from wild - type mice was associated with rapid , broadly distributed , and NMDA receptor - dependent decreases in synapse - associated cortactin . The reduction in cortactin content was blocked by blebbistatin while basal levels were reduced by nocodazole , indicating that cortactin’s movements into and away from synapses are respectively regulated by microtubule and actomyosin motors . These results further suggest that synapse - specific LTP influences cytoskeletal elements at distant connections . The rapid effects of TBS on synaptic cortactin content were absent in Fmr1 - KOs as was evidence for activity - driven phosphorylation of the protein or its upstream kinase , ERK1 / 2 . Phosphorylation regulates cortactin’s interactions with actin and co - precipitation of the two proteins was reduced in the KOs . We propose that , in the KOs , excessive basal phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 disrupts its interactions with cortactin , thereby blocking the latter protein’s use of actomyosin transport systems . These impairments are predicted to compromise the response of the subsynaptic cytoskeleton to learning - related afferent activity , both locally and at distant sites .

Recent work determined that signaling involving the GTPase RhoA and the actin severing protein cofilin is critical for the formation of new filaments ( Rex et al . , 2009 ) , but the events underlying their delayed stabilization are poorly understood .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t observation that theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) commonly used to produce LTP activates p - 21 activated kinase ( PAK ) and Src tyrosine kinases ( Chen et al . , 2007 , 2010a ) . PAK and Src target cortactin ( Lua and Low , 2005 ) , a protein that promotes F - actin elaboration and stabilization in many cellular systems . Cortactin activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , initiates F - actin branching , and stabilizes branch - sites ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Cortactin also prevents F - actin depolymerization by capping barbed ends ( Le Clainche et al . , 2007 ) and inhibiting cofilin ( Oser et al . , 2009 ) . As expected from this , cortactin regulates and maintains dendritic spine morphology in cultured neurons ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) . Together these findings suggest that cortactin may contribute to the production and stabilization of changes in spine anatomy that occur with LTP ( De Roo et al . , 2008 ; Yang et al . , 2008 ) . Cortactin’s influence on actin networks and morphology in non - neuronal cells depends on movement between membrane and cytoplasmic compartments . Notably , events associated with LTP – activation of synaptic brain derived neurotrophic factor and glutamate receptors – cause cortactin to move into and out of spines in dissociated neurons , respectively ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ; Iki et al . , 2005 ; Chen and Hsueh , 2012 ) . PAK and ERK1 / 2 regulate cortactin mobility ; whether actomyosin motors , which contribute importantly to LTP ( Rex et al . , 2010 ) , are involved is not known . Accordingly , initial goals of the present studies were to test if naturalistic TBS influences cortactin levels at hippocampal synapses , and if such effects involve active transport mechanisms . Actin regulation is also of interest with regard to spine abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders ( Penzes et al . , 2011 ) . Aberrant spine morphology is assumed to reflect defects in the underlying cytoskeleton , which could arise from reduced effects of synaptic activity on actin networks . In support of this , LTP does not properly consolidate in rodent models of several human conditions associated with abnormal spines ( Lynch et al . , 2008 ) . For the Fmr1 - knockout ( KO ) model of Fragile X Syndrome , which is characterized by poorly developed spines ( Irwin et al . , 2000 ) , the consolidation deficit is associated with impaired actin - regulatory signaling through Rac GTPase ( Chen et al . , 2010b ) . Prompted by these findings , we also evaluated TBS effects on cortactin in adult Fmr1 - KO hippocampus . Results show that induction of LTP reduces cortactin concentrations at wild - type synapses , within and beyond fields of synaptic activation . These effects were profoundly disturbed in Fmr1 - KOs , likely reflecting impairments in ERK1 / 2 activation and processes that associate cortactin with local transport machinery . Disruption of synaptic activity effects on cytoskeletal regulatory sequences likely contributes to disturbances in spine morphology , synaptic plasticity , and cognitive function in the mutants . Materials and Methods Animals Fmr1 - KO mice backcrossed onto the FVB - 129 background for 11 generations ( Irwin et al . , 2002 ; Lauterborn et al . , 2007 ) and wild - type ( WT ) age - matched FVB mice were used . Procedures were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Electrophysiology Acute transverse hippocampal slices ( 350 µm thick ) were prepared from adult ( 2 – 4 mo old ) male Fmr1 - KO and WT mice , and 2 mo old male Sprague Dawley rats , using a Leica Vibroslicer as described ( Lauterborn et al . , 2007 ) with some modifications . The Vibroslicer cutting bath included artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( aCSF ) with high Mg 2 + ( in mM : 124 NaCl , 3 KCl , 1 . 25 KH 2 PO 4 , 5 MgSO 4 , 26 NaHCO 2 , and 10 dextrose , pH 7 . 4 ) or , when Seese et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t specified , choline chloride ( in mM : 110 choline chloride , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 . 25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 5 MgSO 4 , 25 NaHCO 2 , 25 glucose , ascorbic acid 11 . 6 , and pyruvic acid 3 . 1 , pH 7 . 4 ) ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . Slices were , in all cases , transferred to a holding chamber containing high Mg 2 + aCSF during the cutting process and then to an interface recording chamber set to 31°C with constant perfusion of aCSF containing , in mM , 124 NaCl , 3 KCl , 1 . 25 KH 2 PO 4 , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 1 . 5 MgSO 4 , 26 NaHCO 2 , and 10 dextrose , pH 7 . 4 . Slices equilibrated in the chamber for 2 h before use . For induction of LTP , stimulation electrodes were placed in stratum ( str . ) radiatum of fields CA1a and CA1c and a field recording electrode was placed in CA1b str . radiatum ; the two stimulation electrodes drove distinct populations of synapses in the recording field and were employed to increase the numbers of synapses activated with TBS . Stimulation was set to elicit field excitatory post synaptic potentials ( fEPSPs ) that were 50 % of the maximum population spike - free amplitude . After stable baseline fEPSPs were collected for 20 min , TBS ( 10 burst of 4 pulses at 100 Hz ; 200 ms between bursts ) or control low frequency stimulation ( 3 / min ) was applied at each stimulation electrode ( with the 2 stimulation trains separated by 30 – 40 sec ) ; stimulus pulse duration was increased to 1 . 5X baseline settings during TBS only . Test responses to 3 / min pulses at baseline strength were then collected until tissue harvest . For antidromic stimulation experiments , one stimulating electrode was placed in the alveus ( superficial axon bundles ) on the subicular side of the recording electrode which was located in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1b . Following a 10 minute baseline , slices were stimulated using control stimulation ( 3 / min ) or TBS and then recorded for another 5 minutes . The stimulating electrode was then moved to a second alvear site ; baseline was again recorded followed by either control stimulation or TBS . Slices were harvested 10 min later . In some experiments the myosin II kinase inhibitor blebbistatin ( 10 µM ; Tocris Bioscience ) , the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole ( 200 nM ; Tocris Bioscience ) , or the NMDA receptor antagonist DL - 2 - Amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoic acid ( APV ; 100 µM ; Tocris ) was infused into the tissue bath via a second perfusion line for approximately 30 – 60 min ; the compounds remained in the bath until tissue harvest 7 min following stimulation . Immunohistochemistry As described elsewhere ( Chen et al . , 2010b ) , hippocampal slices were harvested into cold 4 % paraformaldehyde , subsectioned at 20 µm using a freezing microtome , and slide - mounted . The tissue was incubated overnight at room temperature in a primary antisera cocktail containing mouse antisera to PSD95 ( 1 : 1000 ; # MA1 - 054 , Thermo Scientific ) or goat antisera to GluR1 ( 1 : 100 ; # sc - 7609 , Santa Cruz ) in combination with rabbit antisera to cortactin ( 1 : 250 ; # sc - 11408 , Santa Cruz ) , phosphorylated ( p ) - Cortactin Ser405 ( 1 : 500 ; # AB - 100 , Protea Bio ) , or p - ERK1 / 2 Thr202 / Tyr204 ( 1 : 500 ; # 4370 , Cell Signaling ) . After washes in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 2 ( PB ) , the tissue was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a cocktail of AlexaFluor 488 anti - mouse IgG or anti - goat IgG with AlexaFluor 594 anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 1000 each ; Invitrogen ) . Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 0 . 1 M PB containing 4 % BSA and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 . After final PB rinses , the tissue was cover - slipped with VectaShield ( Vector Labs ) . For experiments evaluating the incidence of dendritic spine immunoreactivity for cortactin and p - Cortactin , brains of adult ( 2 – 4 mo old ) male WT and Fmr1 - KO mice were fast frozen in 2 - methylbutane ( −50°C ) and cryostat sectioned on the coronal plane at 20 µm . The slide mounted tissue sections were fixed in −20°C methanol for 20 min , washed in 0 . 1 M PB , and then processed for dual - immunofluorescence as described above . Seese et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Image acquisition and analysis For hippocampal slice experiments , 3 to 4 tissue sections through each slice were used to acquire image z - stacks ( 0 . 2 µm steps ) of immunolabeling within the CA1b str . radiatum recording field ( between the stimulating electrodes ) using a Leica DM6000 epifluorescence microscope . For fast frozen brain sections , image z - stacks were collected ( as above ) from CA1b str . radiatum of 3 to 4 tissue sections through mid - septotemporal hippocampus . In both instances , images were processed for iterative deconvolution ( Volocity 4 . 1 Restorative Deconvolution , Perkin Elmer ) . Automated in - house software was then used to construct three - dimensional ( 3D ) montages of the 136 × 105 × 3 µm sample fields ( Rex et al . , 2009 ; Chen et al . , 2010b ) to count and measure volumes of single - and double - labeled puncta within the size constraints of dendritic spines . Puncta were counted as double - labeled if there was any overlap in their immunolabeled boundaries as evaluated in 3D . Counts of double - labeled postsynaptic densities ( PSDs ) were normalized to the total number of PSD95 - immunopositive ( + ) puncta within a given sample field . Tissue sections with cortactin + PSD counts that were more than 4 standard deviations ( SDs ) removed from the mean of the remainder of the sample fields from that group ( all sections for all slices in a group ) were not included in the analysis . The aberrant section values tended to occur on particular slices , resulting in a loss of 3 . 4 % of the slices . Section exclusions because of the 4 SD rule for the remainder of the slices was 4 . 9 % . Synaptoneurosome and Western blot analysis Male and female WT and Fmr1 - KO mice , at 16 – 18 days of age , were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated . The forebrain was isolated , homogenized in a glass tube with teflon pestle , and centrifuged at 2500 × g to remove contaminating erythrocytes . Synaptoneurosomes were isolated at the interface of a two - phase ( 7 . 5 % and 10 % ) Ficoll gradient following ultracentrifugation at 28 , 000 × g for 50 min at 4°C ( Bernard - Trifilo et al . , 2005 ) . Samples were adjusted to 1 . 5 µg / µl using aCSF and then either ( a ) immunoprecipitated ( Thermo Scientific Co - Immunoprecipitation Kit ) with anti - cortactin ( # sc - 30772 , Santa Cruz ) followed by Western blot analysis or ( b ) run immediately for 8 , 10 , or 12 % PAGE Western blot analysis ( Rex et al . , 2009 ) . In all cases blots were incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antisera including mouse antisera to actin ( 1 : 10000 ; # A1978 , Sigma ) and p - ERK1 / 2 Thr202 / Tyr204 ( 1 : 1500 ; # 9106 , Cell Signaling ) and rabbit antisera to ERK1 / 2 ( # 9102 ; 1 : 2500 , Cell Signaling ) , PAK1 ( 1 : 100 ; # 2602 , Cell Signaling ) , PAK3 ( 1 : 100 ; # 06 – 902 , Millipore ) , and cortactin ( 1 : 2000 ; # sc - 11408 , Santa Cruz ) . Bands were visualized using ECL + chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) , quantified using ImageJ ( NIH ) , and normalized to sample actin or input - cortactin content . Statistical Analyses Statistical significance ( considered p < 0 . 05 ) was assessed using a two - way repeated - measures ANOVA with planned post hoc comparisons , the two - tailed Student’s t - test , or the Mann - Whitney U test . A single “n” was considered to be a hippocampal slice for immunohistochemical analyses following electrophysiology , an animal for immunohistochemical analyses of brain tissue sections , and an independently treated sample in studies with synaptoneurosomes . Unless otherwise specified , values in text and figures show group means ± SEM . Results Electron microscopy ( EM ) has produced somewhat conflicting results regarding the localization of cortactin within spines . Pre - embedding immuno - EM analyses described two pools , a small one near the post - synaptic density ( PSD ) and a larger pool located deeper within the spine head ( Racz and Weinberg , 2004 ) . These experiments found that only a Seese et al . Page 4 J Neurosci . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 23 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t small percentage of synapses are associated with high levels of the protein . Other work using high pressure freezing EM indicated that nearly all cortactin is distributed within 100 nm of the cytoplasmic face of the synapse ( Rostaing et al . , 2006 ) , but this study did not address variations in cortactin immunoreactivity ( ir ) across synapses or types of spines . Both works found cortactin was present at low to negligible levels in axon terminals . Given the uncertainties about localization , we used rigorous criteria to identify postsynaptic elements associated with cortactin - ir . First , cortactin immunopositive ( + ) puncta were counted as being associated with a synapse only when they overlapped , as evaluated in 3D , elements immunoreactive for the integral PSD protein , PSD95 ( Walikonis et al . , 2000 ; Aoki et al . , 2001 ) ( Figure 1A ) . Second , to identify cortactin - enriched synapses , we restricted the analysis to cortactin clusters whose labeling intensity was ≥85 % above the mean for control slices . Using these criteria , 1 – 6 % of the PSD95 + elements that met the size and eccentricity constraints for synapses were co - localized with dense concentrations of cortactin in CA1 str . radiatum of acute hippocampal slices . PSDs ( and concentrations of PSD95 ) are exclusively localized to asymmetric , spine synapses in adult rodent str . radiatum ( Aoki et al . , 2001 ; Megias et al . , 2001 ) ; thus , these values reflect numbers of spines containing high concentrations of cortactin - ir in the sample field . Theta burst stimulation decreases cortactin + synapses in wild - type ( WT ) hippocampus To test for effects of TBS on spine cortactin content , WT hippocampal slices received either one train of ten theta bursts or control low frequency ( 3 / min ) stimulation delivered to two stimulating electrodes placed in the apical Schaffer collateral - commissural projections to field CA1b . Slices were harvested at a range of time points from 7 to 90 min post - TBS and processed for dual immunofluorescence localization of PSD95 and cortactin ; the numbers of double - labeled puncta were quantified for the 105 × 136 × 3 µm sample field and values from slices receiving TBS were normalized to measures from yoked ( same mouse ) , low frequency controls . TBS caused a pronounced decrease in the number of PSD95 + elements double - labeled for dense cortactin - ir in WT slices ; the effect was significant over the period from 7 to 45 min post - TBS with numbers returning to control levels by 90 min after stimulation ( Figure 1B , left ) . We repeated the experiment using a modified aCSF ( during cutting only ) that contains choline chloride ( 110 mM ) instead of NaCl ; in agreement with others ( Kirov et al . , 2004 ) , we find that removal of NaCl better preserves dendritic morphology and spine numbers through slice preparation at low temperatures ( unpublished observations ) . In the choline chloride - prepared slices , TBS caused a ~ 50 % decrease in the number of densely cortactin + PSDs ( Figure 1B , right ) . We further tested for the reduction using the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 as a marker for excitatory synapses . Using the same size and eccentricity criteria described above for recognizing synapses , we found that 1 . 84 ± 0 . 49 % ( mean ± SD ) of the synapse - sized GluR1 clusters were tightly associated with dense concentrations of cortactin - ir in slices administered only low frequency ( 3 / min ) stimulation . TBS reduced this double - labeled value to 1 . 24 ± 0 . 32 % ( mean ± SD ) of the total synapse population , a 32 % reduction from control that was highly significant ( p < 0 . 005 ; Figure 1C ) . TBS activates only a small percentage of the synapses in the apical CA1 dendritic field ( Chen et al . , 2007 ) , and it is therefore unlikely that the substantial losses of synaptic cortactin - ir described here are restricted to those contacts directly affected by TBS . Analyses of the CA1b basal dendrites , which are not innervated by the stimulated str . radiatum projections ( Amaral and Lavenex , 2007 ) , confirmed this point : theta bursts reduced the number of PSDs associated with dense cortactin - ir in str . oriens by about 30 % ( i . e . , to 72 . 8 ± 8 . 3 % of con , p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 1D ) . To corroborate this finding , the laminar distribution of TBS effects was evaluated in hippocampal slices from adult rat . Theta bursts delivered to str . radiatum caused a decrease in synapses co - localized with dense concentrations of Seese et al . Page 5 J Neurosci .

We next asked if the LTP - related events set in motion by TBS are involved in the loss of cortactin labeling at synapses scattered across much of the pyramidal cell’s dendritic tree . WT slices were pretreated with the NMDA receptor antagonist APV for 30 minutes prior to TBS and then collected 7 minutes after stimulation . Matched controls were infused with APV but did not receive TBS ; an additional two groups ( control stimulation vs . TBS ) were tested in the absence of the NMDA receptor antagonist . TBS again markedly ( −53 % ) reduced the number of densely cortactin + synapses in slices maintained in normal aCSF ( p < 0 . 007 ) but failed to produce a statistically significant effect in APV - treated slices ( −15 % ; p > 0 . 20 ) ( Figure 2A , left ) . Interpretation of these results is complicated by a tendency for APV to reduce the percentage of double - labeled synapses in control ( 3 / min stimulation only ) slices ( see figure 2A ) ; while this effect did not approach significance ( p = 0 . 15 ) , it could conceivably obscure any losses produced by TBS . We therefore converted the percent of doubled - labeled synapses in the two TBS groups to Z - scores for differences from the means of their respective controls ( [ value for each TBS slice minus the mean of the no - TBS group ] / SD of the no - TBS group ) . TBS produced a reduction of −1 . 30 ± 0 . 50 SDs from matched controls for slices maintained in control aCSF and a −0 . 50 ± 0 . 58 decrease in APV - treated slices ( p = 0 . 016 ) ( Figure 2A , right ) . We conclude that blocking NMDA receptors has a marked and negative effect on TBS - driven changes in the number of densely cortactin + synapses . How does theta - driven NMDA receptor activation , in a small set of synapses within a discrete portion of the dendritic tree , produce cell - wide changes in cortactin concentrations at non - activated contacts ? A likely explanation involves the induction of action potentials at cell bodies followed by the retrograde propagation of spikes into the proximal apical and basal branches of the neuron’s dendritic arborization . We tested this idea using TBS - driven antidromic spiking of CA1 pyramidal cells . A stimulating electrode was placed in the alveus ( superficial axon bundles ) on the subicular side of a recording electrode lowered into the CA1b pyramidal cell layer ( identified visually and by cell spiking ) and TBS was delivered after baseline recording . This was repeated for two alvear sites per slice . Single stimulation pulses produced a large ( 3 – 7 mV ) antidromic population spike ( Figure 2B ) that was much larger than any recorded during orthodromic TBS . As expected , the size of the antidromic responses were not altered by theta bursts ( Figure 2B ) . Normalization to matched controls showed that antidromic TBS had no measurable effect on the densely cortactin + synapses in str . oriens and caused a non - significant increase in str . radiatum ( Figure 2C ) . In all , cell spiking in the theta burst pattern does not reduce the number of cortactin + synapses in hippocampal field CA1 . Collectively , the above results suggest that an event initiated by the prolonged depolarization and calcium increases produced by orthodromic TBS , but not by much briefer cell spiking episodes , spreads extensively along dendrites and affects a significant number of cortactin - rich synapses . The above analyses dealt with synapses with dense immunostaining for cortactin ( ≥85 % above the mean immunolabeling intensity for control slices ) . The marked reductions produced by TBS could therefore reflect an effect on a small population of synapses with particularly high levels of the protein or a TBS - induced leftward shift of the curve relating numbers of co - labeled synapses to the intensity of cortactin labeling , thereby affecting a markedly larger population of synapses . We distinguished between these alternatives by constructing a curve relating cortactin immunolabeling intensity to the number of double - Seese et al . Page 6 J Neurosci .

The distribution of cortactin + contacts across these intensity categories was clearly changed by TBS ( Figure 2E ; 2 - way ANOVA : p = 0 . 0002 ) : the decrease in densely labeled synapses in the TBS group was accompanied by an equivalent increase in the proportion of synapses with weak cortactin immunostaining . Importantly , the total number of double - labeled synapses was unchanged by TBS ( control : 14 , 034 ± 582 per sample zone ; TBS : 13 , 364 ± 827 ) , as was the total number of PSD95 + elements ( 30 , 978 ± 1 , 156 vs . 30 , 218 ± 1 , 559 ) . We conclude from these calculations that TBS reduces cortactin concentrations at a substantial percentage of the synaptic population . Effects of TBS on synaptic cortactin are impaired in Fmr1 - KO slices Prior studies showed that TBS increases dendritic spine levels of activated Rac and phosphorylated ( p ) - PAK Ser141 in field CA1 of hippocampal slices from WT but not Fmr1 - KO mice ( Chen et al . , 2010b ) . Both Rac and PAK modulate cortactin compartmentalization ( Weed et al . , 2000 ; Webb et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that cortactin movement within spines might be impaired in the mutants . Analysis of immunofluorescence within brain tissue sections from adult male Fmr1 - KO and WT mice detected no effect of genotype on numbers of densely cortactin + puncta double - labeled for PSD95 within CA1 str . radiatum ( WT , 4 . 44 ± 0 . 45 % ; KO , 4 . 05 ± 0 . 26 % ; expressed as percent of the total PSD95 + population ; p = 0 . 46 , two - tailed Student’s t - test ; Figure 3A ) . Moreover , total cortactin - ir in synaptoneurosomal samples did not differ between genotypes as determined by Western blot analysis ( Figure 3B ) . Nonetheless , and in marked contrast to the results from WT slices , TBS had no effect on the number of PSDs associated with dense cortactin - ir in Fmr1 - KO mice through the first 20 min after stimulation ; numbers trended lower by 45 min and were significantly below control values at 90 min post - TBS ( Figure 3C ) . The markedly delayed effect of TBS on synaptic cortactin - ir in the KOs is not likely to reflect differences in EPSP responses to the theta train . As described elsewhere ( Lauterborn et al . , 2007 ) , input / output curves , fEPSP waveforms , and composite responses to the theta bursts are comparable in slices from FVB WT and Fmr1 - KO mice . We also found that short - term potentiation and the initial expression of LTP following a 10 - burst theta train are indistinguishable between WT and Fmr1 - KO slices ( Lauterborn et al . , 2007 ) . We replicated the latter findings in slices harvested here for immunostaining at later post - TBS time points ( Figure 3D ) . Together , these results indicate that impaired activity - dependent changes in cortactin content at Fmr1 - KO synapses involve defects in the cellular events set in motion by theta stimulation rather than genotype differences in levels of depolarization achieved with TBS . Active transport maintains cortactin levels at synapses in WT mice The TBS - induced loss and recovery of synaptic cortactin in WT slices could reflect proteolysis followed by the arrival of new protein copies or the operation of translocation processes . To distinguish between these possibilities , and potentially understand the nature of defects in the Fmr1 - KOs , we applied blebbistatin , a potent and selective toxin that inhibits myosin II function and thus activation of myosin motors ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . As demonstrated in prior work with hippocampal slices ( Rex et al . , 2010 ) , the dose of blebbistatin used here has no detectable effect on field CA1 baseline fEPSPs , paired pulse facilitation , mEPSCs , the input / output curve generated with single pulse stimulation , or theta burst responses , but it does completely block LTP . In the present studies we further determined that blebbistatin infused for 30 – 60 min has no effect on the mean size ( Figure 4A ) or size frequency distribution ( not shown ) of PSD95 + elements in CA1b str . radiatum . Nonetheless , blebbistatin completely eliminated TBS - induced decreases in cortactin - ir associated with PSDs in hippocampal slices from WT mice ( Figure 4B ) . Seese et al . Page 7 J Neurosci .

Moreover , cortactin reportedly associates with the positive end of microtubules in spines ( Jaworski et al . , 2009 ) . We tested for a microtubule role in regulating spine cortactin levels by acutely treating slices with low concentrations of nocodazole ( 200 nM , 1 h ) , which blocks polymerization of the dynamic populations of microtubules normally found in spines ( Vasquez et al . , 1997 ; Jaworski et al . , 2009 ) . The results were surprising : nocodazole had no effect on the size ( Figure 4C ) or waveforms ( Figure 4D ) of fEPSPs , or on the total number of PSD95 + elements ( not shown ) , but caused a ~ 35 % decrease in the number of synapses associated with dense concentrations of cortactin - ir in WT slices ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 4E ) . We next asked if the labile pool of cortactin - ir maintained at synapses by microtubule - dependent processes overlaps that reduced by TBS . Nocodazole was infused beginning one hour prior to delivering theta stimulation . Under these conditions , TBS did not detectably change the number of densely cortactin + synapses from that found in matched WT slices that received control stimulation as assessed at 7 min ( Figure 4E ) . In marked contrast to its actions in WT slices , nocodazole did not reduce the baseline number of double - labeled synapses in Fmr1 - KO cases ; as in untreated mutant slices , TBS had no effect on numbers of densely cortactin + contacts ( Figure 4F ) . Collectively , the above results point to the conclusion that WT synapses have a dynamic pool of cortactin that is both continuously replenished by a microtubule - dependent mechanism and rapidly diminished by TBS via actomyosin motors . The Fragile X mutation appears to block both of these cortactin - related transport dependent processes . Cortactin’s phosphorylation and actin interactions are deficient in Fmr1 - KO hippocampus A failure to properly interact with actin - based transport systems could account for the observed disturbance of TBS effects on synaptic cortactin concentrations in Fmr1 - KO slices . We tested this using co - immunoprecipitation from synaptoneurosomes . Levels of total actin and cortactin immunoreactivities were comparable in samples prepared from forebrains of Fmr1 - KO and WT mice , but approximately 40 % less actin co - immunoprecipitated with cortactin in the mutants ( Figure 5A ) . Serine phosphorylation regulates cortactin’s interactions with F - actin and its ability to translocate within the cell ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ; Iki et al . , 2005 ; Cosen - Binker and Kapus , 2006 ; Kruchten et al . , 2008 ) . We tested for genotype effects on cortactin Ser405 phosphorylation at synapses in CA1 str . radiatum in brain tissue sections using dual immunostaining and found the number of densely phosphorylated ( p ) - Cortactin + PSDs to be reduced by about 50 % in Fmr1 - KOs relative to WTs ( Figure 5B ) . Further evidence that kinase signaling to cortactin is disturbed in the mutants was evident after TBS . A single train of ten theta bursts produced a robust and reliable increase in the number of PSDs associated with high concentrations of p - Cortactin in slices from WT mice but had no effect in Fmr1 - KOs ( Figure 5C ) . These results indicate that phosphorylation defects are likely contributors to the reduced association of cortactin with F - actin in the mutants . We next asked if changes to upstream kinases account for the disturbances just described . Recent work showed that activated ( phosphorylated ) levels of PAK , which plays a prominent role in regulating cortactin mobility ( Campbell et al . , 1999 ; Webb et al . , 2006 ) , are at near normal levels at Fmr1 - KO synapses in hippocampus ( Chen et al . , 2010b ) . We have confirmed this point using Western blots of synaptoneurosomes ( data not shown ) . Analyses of ERK1 / 2 ( a . k . a . , p44 / 42 MAPK ) , a second kinase that figures prominently in regulating cortactin , have produced mixed results regarding activities in Fmr1 - KO forebrain : several studies report that basal levels of total and phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 are comparable in KO and WT mice ( Hu et al . , 2008 ; Ronesi and Huber , 2008 ; Weng et al . , 2008 ; Gross et al . , 2010 ) , while others describe increased levels of p - ERK in hippocampus ( Hou et al . , Seese et al . Page 8 J Neurosci . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 23 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t 2006 ) . Our own analyses using synaptoneurosomes indicate that phosphorylated , but not total , ERK1 / 2 is massively elevated in KO synaptic fractions ( Figure 5D ) . Given that the phosphorylated state of the kinase is expected to affect its attachment to cortactin , the striking differences between mutant and WT preparations should be reflected in the extent to which the proteins co - immunoprecipitate . We confirmed this prediction : immunoprecipitation of cortactin brought down much less ERK - immunoreactivity in synaptoneurosomes from KOs as compared to WTs ( Figure 5E ) . There was a trend for reduced co - precipitation of PAK1 with cortactin in the KOs but this did not approach statistical significance ( Figure 5E ) . Similarly , co - precipitation of PAK3 with cortactin was not significantly different in samples from KO and WT mice ( p = 0 . 27 ; data not shown ) . The hyperphosphorylation of ERK in the mutants would also be expected to disturb any response of the kinase to TBS . We tested this and found that TBS doubled the number of PSDs co - localized with p - ERK in WT slices while having no detectable effect in the mutants ( Figure 5F ) . Collectively , results described in this section suggests a hypothesis in which abnormal phosphorylation of ERK leads to i ) a baseline reduction in cortactin phosphorylation in the synaptic compartment , resulting in ii ) reduced association of the protein with actomyosin motors , and iii ) a subsequent failure of TBS to translocate cortactin away from synapses . Discussion The present results demonstrate that TBS causes rapid reductions in cortactin levels at excitatory synapses in adult hippocampus of WT , but not Fmr1 - KO , mice . Although intense NMDA receptor activation has been shown to cause cortactin redistribution from spines into the dendritic shaft ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ; Iki et al . , 2005 ) , our studies provide novel evidence that naturalistic activity patterns used to induce LTP elicit rapid , activity - driven and motor - dependent movement of the protein away from synapses in adult brain . Moreover , the distribution of changes in synaptic cortactin - ir indicates the effect is not limited to contacts activated by TBS . A sizable body of work indicates that LTP is synapse specific , an observation critical to the argument that the effect is a substrate for memory . The present results challenge the synapse specificity of at least some of the neurochemical changes associated with LTP . Specifically , we show that potentiation of a subpopulations of synapses in CA1 str . radiatum reduces cortactin levels at distant synapses including those within str . oriens . This suggests that localized LTP affects how distant contacts will respond to subsequent afferent activity . Without challenging the synapse specificity of LTP , prior work has shown that potentiation in one population of synapses initiates protein synthesis - dependent events that lower the threshold for modification in neighboring synapses ( i . e . , synaptic ‘tagging’ ; Alarcon et al . , 2006 ; Reymann and Frey , 2007 ) . Cortactin translocation could represent part of the tagging machinery but , as the shift occurs within minutes of stimulation , it is likely to cause changes well in advance of protein synthesis - dependent events . The spatially extended effects of TBS were detected by evaluating PSDs associated with dense cortactin - ir in particular , an approach that facilitated quantitative analysis of TBS - induced changes . However , analysis of the broad cortactin immunofluorescence intensity distribution showed that TBS shifts the distribution of synaptic cortactin + clusters from ‘dense cortactin - ir’ to ‘weak cortactin - ir’ categories without changing the total number of double - labeled contacts . Thus , cortactin did not vacate spines as has been reported to occur in cultured cells with intense NMDAR stimulation . It will be of interest in future research to determine if delivery of TBS to multiple sites on target neurons , as opposed to the single apical sublamina used here , reduces cortactin levels in a greater proportion of synapses .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t could have functional consequences that do not necessarily violate the synapse specificity of LTP . As discussed , cortactin regulates the architecture and stability of the actin cytoskeleton and these effects reflect its disposition across subcellular compartments ( Weed et al . , 2000 ; Oser et al . , 2009 ) . Since cytoskeletal reorganization is critical to the stabilization , but not induction or initial expression , of LTP ( Lynch et al . , 2008 ; Ramachandran and Frey , 2009 ) , we propose that widespread effects on cortactin compartmentalization represent a form of metaplasticity ( Perez - Otano and Ehlers , 2005 ) that affects serial consolidation events set in motion by the arrival of TBS at previously naïve connections . Consolidation both maintains LTP ( Lynch et al . , 2007 ; Bramham , 2008 ) and increases its resistance to reversal by low frequency stimulation ( Staubli and Scafidi , 1999 ; Kramar and Lynch , 2003 ) . Thus , tests for reversibility could be used to determine if induction of localized LTP affects the stability of subsequently induced potentiation at distant synapses in a cortactin - dependent fashion . In all , the present studies raise the possibility that learning - related afferent activity elicits neuron - wide changes that influence the later production of enduring synaptic changes . Our results place constraints on mechanisms likely to mediate TBS effects on synaptic cortactin levels . Theta - driven antidromic spikes had no significant effects on numbers of densely cortactin + PSDs , suggesting that back - propagation of action potentials into dendrites is not involved . However , the NMDA receptor antagonist APV blocked the interaction between TBS and synaptic cortactin content . Possibly , repetitive and prolonged ( 50 – 100 msec ) episodes of depolarization produced by TBS ( Larson and Lynch , 1988 ; Chen et al . , 2010a ; zur Nedden et al . , 2011 ) , or elevations of local calcium concentrations that follow NMDA receptor activation , initiate biochemical events that spread for some distance into the dendritic tree . A first step in discriminating between the depolarization vs . calcium explanations will be to determine if pharmacologically enhancing TBS - induced depolarization in str . radiatum ( e . g . , with GABA - AR antagonists ) reduces synaptic cortactin in basal dendrites in the presence of APV . Blocking myosin II motors with blebbistatin ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) , at concentrations that do not affect baseline transmission ( Rex et al . , 2010 ) , eliminated TBS effects on spine cortactin . The non - muscle myosin light chain is phosphorylated within spines by TBS ( Rex et al . , 2010 ) , an event required for actin polymerization and LTP stabilization , and is a binding partner of cortactin ( Brown et al . , 2010 ) . These points strongly suggest that myosin II motors either directly transport cortactin away from synapses or promote formation of actin networks needed for such transport . A complementary mechanism is suggested by the finding that nocodazole , which accelerates depolymerization of dynamic microtubules ( Vasquez et al . , 1997 ) , reduced the basal number of densely cortactin + synapses in WT slices . Combined , the results describe a dynamic subsynaptic system in which tubule - dependent influx offsets a steady loss of cortactin , while events that occur during or shortly after TBS engage actomyosin motors to generate a sudden and pronounced depletion of the active ( nocodazole - sensitive ) pool ( Figure 6A – B ) . A more detailed version of this argument will require temporal parameters for the baseline cycling of the protein ; notably , replacement after TBS required over an hour , indicating that influx is relatively slow . Beyond this lies the critical question of how intense depolarization and / or localized increases in calcium concentrations extend the influence of LTP to actomyosin networks in distant spines . The effects of LTP along with the machinery proposed in Figure 6A – B to control cortactin movement were profoundly disturbed in Fmr1 - KO hippocampus : TBS did not rapidly reduce synaptic cortactin content and nocodazole had no effect on basal concentrations . These results describe novel defects in the mutants that are plausibly related to the maintenance of spine morphology and synaptic plasticity . A search for underlying causes revealed that baseline cortactin serine phosphorylation is greatly reduced at Fmr1 - KO Seese et al . Page 10 J Neurosci .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t synapses as were increases in spine p - Cortactin produced by TBS . Phosphorylation regulates cortactin’s association with actomyosin motors ( Lua and Low , 2005 ) and , indeed , co - immunoprecipation demonstrated that cortactin’s association with actin was reduced in Fmr1 - KO synaptoneurosomes . These findings suggest that the fundamental problem lies in the association of cortactin with upstream kinases . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed this prediction with regard to ERK1 / 2 . Immunohistochemical analyses then established that the TBS - induced increases in synaptic p - ERK , that are robust in WT slices , are entirely absent in the mutants . These results extend descriptions of impaired ERK responses in the KOs to various neuromodulators ( i . e . , mGluR agonists , histamine , glycine ) ( Hou et al . , 2006 ; Hu et al . , 2008 ; Kim et al . , 2008 ; Shang et al . , 2009 ; but see Osterweil et al . , 2010 ) to the synaptic compartment and responses to naturalistic patterns of afferent input . The present studies also establish that the kinase is excessively phosphorylated in the spine compartment . We therefore propose that baseline disturbances to synaptic ERK1 / 2 activity disrupt normal links between the diffuse effects of LTP induction and the association of cortactin with actin - and tubulin - based transport machinery ( Figure 6C ) . Although the normally rapid , myosin II - dependent translocation response of spine cortactin to TBS is missing in Fmr1 - KO mice , a late ( > 45 min ) depression of spine cortactin content was observed . This delay is sufficiently long for contributions from protein translation and there is evidence that excessive local protein synthesis occurs in the KOs ( Li et al . , 2001 ; Qin et al . , 2005 ; Gross et al . , 2010 ; Osterweil et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , it is possible that in these mice TBS triggers exaggerated the production of proteins that interfere with cortactin movement ; an accumulation of these proteins in the spine head after TBS could lead to a delayed disruption of the constitutive positive cortactin flow toward the PSD , and reductions in spine cortactin content , resembling effects produced by nocodazole treatment in the WTs . While speculative , this working model does make the explicit prediction that acute treatments with protein synthesis inhibitors will block the delayed loss of spine cortactin content in the mutants . What functional consequences can be expected from the loss of cortactin mobility at Fmr1 - KO spines and synapses ? If the spatially distributed effects of TBS also normally occur at synapses innervated by the stimulated axons , then disturbances to cytoskeletal modifications needed for LTP consolidation are likely . We found cortactin phosphorylation , actin associations , and movement are all disturbed in the KOs ; these deficits are likely to disturb the coordination of processes needed for normal actin and LTP consolidation in the wake of TBS . Indeed , we have found that the actin filaments that form in spines shortly after TBS are slow to stabilize , as is LTP itself , in Fmr1 - KO hippocampus ( Chen et al . , 2010b ) . Beyond this it is likely that deficits in widespread translocation responses to learning - related patterns of activity will eventually compromise the integrity of the actin networks governing spine morphology . We therefore speculate that the disturbances described in the present report i ) affect plasticity at stimulated synapses , ii ) disturb adjustments pertinent to the reaction of distant connections to subsequent input , and iii ) gradually degrade functional properties of spines throughout the dendritic tree .

Actomyosin motors and microtubules mediate synaptic cortactin motility , and Fragile X model mice underutilize both systems A , At WT synapses in the basal state , synaptic cortactin concentrations ( red - filled circles ) are maintained by nocodazole - sensitive , microtubule mechanisms ( blue arrow ) . B , Following TBS , synaptic ERK and cortactin are phosphorylated ( orange - filled circles denote p - Cortactin ) . These synaptic signaling modifications are accompanied by a pronounced , blebbistatin - sensitive decrease in synaptic cortactin levels , indicating naturalistic afferent activity employs myosin motors ( blue arrow ) to actively translocate cortactin away from the PSD . * The illustrated association and motility of p - Cortactin with actomyosin motors are based on reports that cortactin’s phosphorylation mediates its association with actin .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t is proposed that following TBS , cortactin is first phosphorylated and then transported away from the PSD . C , In Fmr1 - KO mice , basal synaptic ERK is hyperphosphorylated ( * * ) and completely unresponsive to changes in afferent drive ( thin arrows ) . As a result , in the mutants , ERK fails to associate with and phosphorylate cortactin , thereby substantially decreasing synaptic p - Cortactin levels , and disrupting both cortactin’s association with actin and theta - driven movement away from PSDs ( thin dashed arrow , right ) . Moreover , abnormalities in phosphorylation of ERK , a kinase that also regulates microtubule dynamics , may account for the finding that constitutive cortactin levels at the PSD are not maintained by a nocodazole - sensitive transport system ( thin dashed arrow , left ) in the KOs .
