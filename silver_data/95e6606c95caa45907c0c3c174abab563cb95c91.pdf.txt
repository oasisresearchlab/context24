The pandemic has a devastating impact on student entrepreneurial behavior and their mental health . This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID - 19 on the student entrepreneurial intention / behavioral model with a mediating effect of proactive personality and the moderating role of anticipated regret . The sample of the study comprised 345 university students from Pakistan . Data were collected using a self - report and other report survey questionnaires . The hypotheses were investigated using the partial least squares structural equation modeling ( PLS – SEM ) approach . According to the ﬁndings , COVID - 19 perception has a negative and signiﬁcant impact on the student entrepreneurial intention / behavior model . Meanwhile , ﬁndings show that a proactive personality signiﬁcantly mediates the relationship between COVID - 19 perception and entrepreneurial intention . The results show that anticipated regret moderates the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behavior in a favorable and signiﬁcant way . Furthermore , discussion and implications were also discussed in this article . Keywords : COVID - 19 perception , proactive personality , entrepreneurial intention , entrepreneurial behavior , anticipated regret , university students INTRODUCTION Entrepreneurship is a determining factor for social and economic development , enhances the creation of wealth and value , and improves the well - being of nations ( Bogatyreva et al . , 2019 ; Li et al . , 2020 ) . Over the years , entrepreneurship has received a broad consensus in the academic and international communities on its importance ; however , research on its relevance in uncertain and adverse situations is rather scarce ( Jiatong et al . , 2021a ) . COVID - 19 is a dangerous disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus ﬁrst identiﬁed in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 and after that , Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 1 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 838779 fpsyg - 13 - 838779 May 31 , 2022 Time : 14 : 51 # 2 Jiatong et al . COVID - 19 Perception to Entrepreneurial Behavior it is spread rapidly around the world ( Deng and Peng , 2020 ) . The WHO classiﬁed the coronavirus ( COVID - 19 ) outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March , 2020 . Currently , there are more than 117 million cases being registered , and more than 2 . 59 million people died because of coronavirus ( Khadka et al . , 2020 ) . COVID - 19 pandemic has a strong eﬀect on the psychical and psychological health of people . In Pakistan , more than 50 % of people feel psychologically involved in this disease , decreasing their positive feelings and satisfaction with life ( Ullah et al . , 2020 ) . This is echoed by the economic problems that can help inﬂuence people’s quality of life . Social and economic factors are the drivers of the conditions in which people live . Employment , safety , income , education , social support , and discrimination factors account for around 40 % of all health ( Jiatong et al . , 2021b ) . The idea that social and economic factors are related to the health and satisfaction of the individual provides a starting point for an economy that is more focused on human well - being . Previous research has shown that natural disasters , wars , terrorist acts , and pandemics damage countries’ growth and are connected with a drop in investment and gross domestic product ( GDP ) ( Casady and Baxter , 2020 ; Filho et al . , 2020 ) . However , these challenges also aﬀect the formation of new business development and other commercial activities ( Lopes et al . , 2021 ) . The impact of COVID - 19 epidemic has a signiﬁcant impact on the potential entrepreneurs with entrepreneurial ambitions to create new enterprises ( Cao et al . , 2020 ; Hernández - Sánchez et al . , 2020 ) . Prior studies contend that entrepreneurial intent is the most signiﬁcant element in new business growth ( Barba - Sánchez and Atienza - Sahuquillo , 2018 ; Fragoso et al . , 2019 ) . According to Nowi´nski and Haddoud ( 2019 ) , entrepreneurial intention is deﬁned as the desire to establish a new business and pursue a profession other than that of a regular employee . In general , intentions are a good predictor of entrepreneurial activity ( Neneh , 2019a , b ) . Similarly , Shirokova et al . ( 2016 ) imply that starting and running a new business does not always translate goals into actual behavior . Furthermore , numerous researchers have discovered a clear relationship between entrepreneurial qualities and personality and entrepreneurial desire to start a new ﬁrm ( Mei et al . , 2017 ; Hu et al . , 2018 ) , but empirical studies on COVID - 19 pandemics perception , environmental uncertainties , and entrepreneurship has received little attention in the literature . Hernández - Sánchez et al . ( 2020 ) explain how the proactive attitude inﬂuences COVID - 19 perception and entrepreneurial intention . The literature has previously identiﬁed the link between proactive personality and entrepreneurial intention ( Fuller et al . , 2018 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ; Mahmood et al . , 2019 ) . A proactive personality is associated with identifying the opportunity and ﬁnding the appropriate solution in uncertain environmental situations ( Seibert et al . , 1999 ; Yi - Feng Chen et al . , 2021 ) . Altinay et al . ( 2012 ) argue that if the ecological situations are uncertain and dangerous , it will aﬀect the students’ entrepreneurial intention . Obschonka et al . ( 2018 ) found that individual and contextual factors appear to positively and substantially impact the intention / behavior model . Previous studies argue that the relationship between intention and behavior is moderated by self - control , proactive personality , and sex ( Van Gelderen et al . , 2015 ; Shinnar et al . , 2017 ; Neneh , 2019b ) . However , the anticipated regret is typically considered as a motivating element for entrepreneurial intention and action when outcomes are uncertain yet entrepreneurial behavior is socially essential . As a result , this study adds to the literature in the following ways : ﬁrst , it extends the conceptual model ( Neneh , 2019b ) by implying anticipated regret as a moderator in the link between entrepreneurial intention and behavior . Second , this research contributes to the direct eﬀect of COVID - 19 pandemic perception on entrepreneurial intention toward entrepreneurial action in the study setting of Pakistani university students ( Hernández - Sánchez et al . , 2020 ) . Third , this study contributes to the role of proactive personality as a mediating in the relationship with COVID - 19 pandemic perception and entrepreneurial intention , adding to the body of knowledge in the ﬁelds of entrepreneurship and psychology ( Li et al . , 2020 ) . CONCEPTUAL MODEL AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT Theoretical models that analyze the entrepreneurial process emphasize the importance of personal , cognitive , and prescriptive factors to determine the probability that an individual would be willing to start a new business ( Jiatong et al . , 2021b ) . Among the main factors related to entrepreneurial intentions are personality traits associated with entrepreneurs ( Fragoso et al . , 2019 ) . The results of previous studies suggest that personality traits substantially inﬂuence how entrepreneurs think , the objectives they set , and , through their actions , what they achieve ( Cardon and Kirk , 2015 ; Henley et al . , 2017 ) . In particular , previous studies have established that an entrepreneur generally has an optimistic orientation toward the future and seems more capable of ﬁnding opportunities and achieving the desired objectives ( Casson and Wadeson , 2007 ) . This research will focus on four characteristics , namely , proactiveness , optimism , COVID - 19 pandemic perception , and psychological need satisfaction , to quantify the relationship between these four traits of the students and their entrepreneurial intention . In summary , this approach will allow this research to determine the relative importance of the four business characteristics to predict the entrepreneurial intention of students in an adverse situation . The research model is depicted in Figure 1 . The model explains that COVID - 19 pandemic perceptions negatively predict entrepreneurial intention , which positively indicates proactive personality on entrepreneurial intention , then anticipated regret moderates in the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behavior . COVID - 19 Pandemic Perception and Entrepreneurial Intention The prior study argues that COVID - 19 pandemic perception has a negative and signiﬁcant impact on entrepreneurial intention among business and economics students in Latin America ( Hernández - Sánchez et al . , 2020 ) . Considering the role of social cognitive theory in entrepreneurship , the social and economic environment inﬂuences the attitude of the individuals through Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 838779 fpsyg - 13 - 838779 May 31 , 2022 Time : 14 : 51 # 3 Jiatong et al . COVID - 19 Perception to Entrepreneurial Behavior FIGURE 1 | Conceptual model . personal perceptions ( Bacq et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , perceptions are formed in the shape of unsafe and risky environments that aﬀect individuals’ entrepreneurial intention to become entrepreneurs ( Bergner et al . , 2021 ) . Ghosh ( 2018 ) suggests that terrorism attacks , neutral disasters , and uncertain environments harm countries’ growth and new business development activities . Bullough et al . ( 2014 ) argue that perceived danger , self - eﬃcacy is negatively associated with entrepreneurial intention in Afghanistan . Therefore , based on the discussion , we posit that individuals with a higher COVID - 19 pandemic perception are less likely to start a new business . Thus , we hypothesized that H1 : COVID - 19 pandemic perception has a negative inﬂuence on the entrepreneurial intention . Mediating Effect of Proactive Personality Proactive personality refers to identifying the opportunity , showing the advantage , and saving until important change happens ( Buil et al . , 2019 ) . McCormick et al . ( 2019 ) deﬁne the importance of a proactive personality as “a person who can identify the opportunity in an uncertain environment . ” Prior studies argue that individuals behave diﬀerently toward various environmental stimuli ( Tolentino et al . , 2014 ; Jiang , 2017 ) . An individual with a high level of proactive personality will always carry about constructive enhancements . Hu et al . ( 2018 ) explored that more proactive people have more intention of business than other proper to start their own business . Literature advocates that COVID - 19 perception and proactive personality signiﬁcantly inﬂuence entrepreneurial intention in the context of Europe ( Hernández - Sánchez et al . , 2020 ) . Several studies argue that proactive personality signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced entrepreneurial intention and behavior even during natural disasters and economic crises ( Neneh , 2019b ; Li et al . , 2020 ) . Kumar and Shukla ( 2019 ) found that their proactive personalities can predict the students’ entrepreneurial self - eﬃcacy and entrepreneurial intention . Fuller et al . ( 2018 ) suggest that proactive people easily take entrepreneurial decisions to start a new business . Furthermore , Gupta and Bhawe ( 2016 ) explain that individuals who have more proactiveness and risk are more intend to have entrepreneurial intention to become entrepreneurs . Therefore , based on the discussion , we predict that more proactive individuals can manage the business development activities even in COVID - 19 pandemic situation . Thus , we hypothesized that H2 : Proactive personality mediates in the relationship between COVID - 19 pandemic perception and entrepreneurial intention . Entrepreneurial Intention and Entrepreneurial Behavior In the domain of COVID - 19 perception , the link between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial conduct has received less attention ( Van Gelderen et al . , 2015 ; Shinnar et al . , 2017 ) . Entrepreneurial intention refers to an individual ability to start a new business , whereas entrepreneurial behavior refers to start an actual business ( Barba - Sánchez and Atienza - Sahuquillo , 2018 ) . Most of the previous studies discussed the theory of planned behavior as an extension of the theory of reasoned action for measuring the individual intention - behavior models ( Mahmood et al . , 2019 ; Neneh , 2019b ) . According to the theory of planned behavior intentions , an individual’s willingness to engage in entrepreneurial behavior or commitment to start a new business ( Ajzen , 1991 ; Padilla - Angulo , 2017 ) . Given the importance of this hypothesis , previous studies have found that intentions are the best indicator of entrepreneurial behavior ( Shirokova et al . , 2016 ; Neneh , 2019a ) . Moreover , Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 838779 fpsyg - 13 - 838779 May 31 , 2022 Time : 14 : 51 # 4 Jiatong et al . COVID - 19 Perception to Entrepreneurial Behavior Li et al . ( 2020 ) found that entrepreneurial purpose favorably inﬂuences entrepreneurial action , while proactive personality moderates this link . Because of this , people with higher levels of entrepreneurial inclination are more likely to engage in entrepreneurial behaviors and start their own businesses . Hence , we hypothesized that H3 : Entrepreneurial intention are positively associated with entrepreneurial behavior . Moderating Role of Anticipated Regret Anticipated regret is associated with the negative feelings and emotions that an individual experiences before the expected result of their decision to perform a task ( Neneh , 2019b ) . Prior research found that emotions played a vital role in stimulating innovative ideas and exploitation of that idea into reality . It helps individuals make entrepreneurial decision making to start a new business ( Rodrigues et al . , 2019 ) . Metallo et al . ( 2021 ) explain that positive emotions create entrepreneurial passion among individuals while negative emotions create fear and grief to inhibit opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation among individuals to start a new business . Therefore , anticipated regret pushes an individual to become an entrepreneur with passion and other business improvement activities ( Pidduck et al . , 2021 ) . Moreover , studies found that individuals who had regrettable experiences from the past are more likely to involve in actual entrepreneurial behavior and avoid future regret that arises from a failure to act ( Verkijika , 2019 ; Bouderbala , 2020 ) . Thus , based on this discussion , people who have a lot of negative feelings are more likely to identify and take advantage of entrepreneurial possibilities , which could lead them to consider starting their own business ( Ahmed et al . , 2020 ) . Hence , we hypothesized that H4 : Anticipated regret moderate in the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behavior . MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Design and Data Collection Data were gathered from public and private sectors’ business and vocational university students of province , Punjab , Pakistan . Neneh ( 2019b ) argued that there is an emerging and growing trend nowadays that business and vocational university students were engaged in forming new business startups . Scholars have stated that the most studies on students’ entrepreneurial goals have failed to investigate further the link between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial action ( Shirokova et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , data were collected in two waves 5 months apart . A 5 - month timeline was selected to reduce the possibility of diﬀerent changes in intentions over a longer period . In the ﬁrst wave , we distributed 480 questionnaires among university students , and 400 received a participation rate of 83 . 3 % ( ﬁrst wave ) . The objective of this study was to identify how entrepreneurial intentions translate into actual behavior . This study was interested in those students who did not actively participate in business gestation activities . A total of 35 students answered that they had already started a new business and hence were removed from taking part in the second wave of the study . After 5 months , the remaining 365 students were invited to participate in the second wave for data collection , and 345 responses were received in ( second wave ) . Thus , the entrepreneurial intentions responses were measured in the ﬁrst wave of data and entrepreneurial behavior responses in the second wave of data . The original draft of the questionnaire was in the English language because English is the oﬃcial teaching language in the higher education sector of Pakistan . The proﬁle of the respondents were ( 58 % males and 42 % females ) ; age group ( 80 % 18 – 30 years , 15 . 7 % 31 – 40 years , and 4 . 3 % were 41 – above years ) ; education ( 16 . 2 % under - graduation , 42 . 6 % graduation , 35 . 1 % masters , and 6 . 1 % Ph . D . ) . Common Method Bias We used a variety of methods to avoid frequent method bias in the data . Harman’s single factor test was used ﬁrst , and the principal component analysis revealed that no one component explained more than 50 % of the overall variance in factor analysis . Moreover , we analyzed the correlation test among the variables , and the values were satisfactory and not exceeded the threshold value of 0 . 90 as suggested by Podsakoﬀ and Organ ( 2016 ) . Finally , we select self - report and other report surveys instead of self - reported data to avoid the issue of the halo eﬀect and social desirability bias . Thus , this study has not any issue of common method and response biases . Measures To measure students’ entrepreneurial intention , we adapted ﬁve items scale from the study Liñán and Chen ( 2009 ) . Previous researchers widely used this scale ( Jiatong et al . , 2021a ; Murad et al . , 2021 ) . A sample item is “I am ready to do anything to be an entrepreneur . ” Moreover , to assess the proactive personality , we adapted six items’ scale from the study Mahmood et al . ( 2019 ) . A sample item “I excel at identifying opportunities . ” Furthermore , to assess the COVID - 19 pandemic perception , we adapted six measurement constructs from the study Hernández - Sánchez et al . ( 2020 ) . Sample items “The COVID - 19 pandemic decrease my business opportunities . ” Meanwhile , to measure the students’ entrepreneurial behavior , we adapted 10 items from the study Neneh ( 2019a ) . This scale was developed by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor ( GEM ) and widely used by several researchers to evaluate the actual entrepreneurial behavior of the people ( Neneh , 2019b ; Li et al . , 2020 ) . A sample item “I have already purchased material for my business . ” In addition , we adapted two measurement items from the study to assess the role of anticipated regret in the relationship between entrepreneurial intention / behavior relationships ( Neneh , 2019b ) . A sample item “I feel upset if I did not engage in business start - up activities in the next 6 months . ” Data Analysis Technique We used Smart – PLS structural equation modeling technique to test the measurement and structural model of the study . This technique was widely used by prior researchers in social Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 4 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 838779 fpsyg - 13 - 838779 May 31 , 2022 Time : 14 : 51 # 5 Jiatong et al . COVID - 19 Perception to Entrepreneurial Behavior and management sciences ( Hair et al . , 2019 ) . Smart - PLS – SEM method was used instead of the traditional covariance based / technique and that is due to the fact that CB – SEM requires a large sample size . The partial least squares ( PLS ) approach to SEM ( PLS – SEM ) is a suitable , favorable method or instrument used for estimating a complex , hierarchical model representing the credibility , and the methodology of soft modeling assumptions ( Neneh , 2019b ; Li et al . , 2020 ) . RESULTS Measurement Model The ﬁtness of the measurement model was assessed through the Cronbach’s alpha , composite reliability , and convergent validity analysis . According to Henseler et al . ( 2014 ) , the Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability values should be > 0 . 70 , and values of composite reliability should be > 0 . 80 . Moreover , constructs convergent validity was assessed through average variance extracted . As suggested by Hair et al . ( 2012 ) , the values of AVE should be > 0 . 50 . Hence , Table 1 shows that all the values of constructs reliability and validity were acceptable . Furthermore , discriminant validity was evaluated through Fornell and Larcker ( 1981 ) and the Heterotrait – Monotrait criterion . According to Fornell and Larcker ( 1981 ) square root of the AVE is discriminant validity , whereas the values of HTMT should be > 0 . 85 ( Henseler et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , results from Tables 2 , 3 indicate that all the construct’s values met the discriminant validity criteria . Structural Model The ﬁtness of the structural model was evaluated through the value of standardized root mean squares residual SRMR value . According to Henseler et al . ( 2014 ) , a good model must have a > 0 . 08 SMRM value . Our results show that the value of SMRM was 0 . 045 , which indicates the adequate ﬁtness of the model . Moreover , Figure 2 shows that the structural model explained R 2 22 % variance in entrepreneurial behavior , R 2 25 % explained variance in entrepreneurial intention , and R 2 21 % explained variance in proactive personality . According to Chin ( 2010 ) , the desired R 2 should be greater than zero or one . Furthermore , to test the hypotheses , we have hypothesized four hypotheses , and the results of the hypotheses are shown in Table 4 . The results of H1 indicate that COVID - 19 pandemic perception has a negative and signiﬁcant inﬂuence on entrepreneurial intention ( β = − 0 . 245 ∗∗∗ , t = 5 . 680 , p = 0 . 001 ) . Therefore , H1 was accepted . Findings of H2 show that proactive personality has a positive and signiﬁcant indirect eﬀect on the relationship between COVID - 19 pandemic perception and entrepreneurial intention ( β = − 0 . 159 ∗∗∗ , t = 5 . 486 , p = 0 . 001 ) . So , H2 was supported . Meanwhile , the results of H3 indicate that entrepreneurial intention positively associated with entrepreneurial behavior ( β = 0 . 355 ∗∗∗ , t = 6 . 843 , p = 0 . 001 ) . Consequently , H4 was accepted . In addition , to test H4 , ﬁndings illustrate that anticipated regret positively moderates the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behavior ( β = 0 . 086 ∗∗∗ , t = 2 . 853 , p = 0 . 005 ) . Hence , H4 was also supported . DISCUSSION The purpose of this study was to contribute to COVID - 19 pandemic perception on entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behavior among university students in Pakistan who wish to pursue a career in entrepreneurship . Regarding H1 , we hypothesized that the COVID - 19 pandemic was negatively associated with entrepreneurial intention . Our ﬁndings support this rationale that the perception of COVID - 19 pandemic played a negative role in the development of the entrepreneurial process of university students . Our results are consistent with the prior study Hernández - Sánchez et al . ( 2020 ) who TABLE 1 | Constructs factor loadings .

This study model , and the results obtained , is a ﬁrst attempt to close the gap in our knowledge of what drives entrepreneurship in highly adverse conditions ( for example , in economies subject to pandemics ) . Concerning H2 , according to the results of this study , proactive personality would operate as a mediator between COVID - 19 pandemic perception and entrepreneurial intention . Our study adds to the previous literature on personality and entrepreneurship’s mediation outcome of proactive personality , although some past studies reported a direct inﬂuence of proactive personality on entrepreneurial intention ( Hu et al . , 2018 ; Kumar and Shukla , 2019 ) . As such , according to this study , inﬂuencing the entrepreneurial intention of students ( potential entrepreneurs ) , who are hampered by the pandemic situation , means analyzing the psychological and social factors that inﬂuence intentions and understanding how they relate to entrepreneurial behavior in the practice . Therefore , it is highly important to appreciate proactive traits in students so that they can think of entrepreneurship as a possible career option . Furthermore , our research adds to the body of knowledge by concluding that people with a high level of proactive personality are more likely to spot changes in uncertain situations . Regarding H3 , we found that entrepreneurial intention would lead to actual entrepreneurial behavior . This result is in line with previous researchers , who found similar entrepreneurial intention / behavior models results and suggest that students with entrepreneurial intention usually start their new businesses ( Shirokova et al . , 2016 ; Fuller et al . , 2018 ; Neneh , 2019a ) . Concerning H4 , our results show that anticipated regret positively moderates the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behavior . This ﬁnding is similar to Neneh ( 2019b ) and Ahmed et al . ( 2020 ) , who indicates that those with a high amount of anticipated regret are most likely to engage in entrepreneurial activities . This study presents an innovative approach because it examines the psychological aspects of entrepreneurial intention in a pandemic situation . Furthermore , our work conﬁrms previous studies that also show the positive role of need satisfaction , which acts as an accelerator of an entrepreneurial initiative by increasing entrepreneurial intention . In this way , it joins the growing literature that explores how basic psychological needs act as motivational drives that positively inﬂuence one’s future , including career choice . IMPLICATIONS Our study suggests important implications for the higher education sector of Pakistan into the following perspectives , who want to promote entrepreneurship in particularly diﬃcult situations such as pandemic and economic crises . To respond eﬃciently to the crises , ﬁrst it is essential to consider its eﬀects on entrepreneurship . This will help students act rapidly and emerge stronger from COVID - 19 pandemic perception of the entrepreneurial startup process . First , regarding the direct inﬂuence of COVID - 19 pandemic on entrepreneurship , this study provides a moment of reﬂection about the proactive personality could aﬀect individuals’ lives and their happiness because when the environmental situation is uncertain , in a pandemic crisis , persons with a high level of proactive personality are more likely to call on their innovative abilities and establish entrepreneurial intentions . A proactive personality emphasizes strategic goals and proliﬁc activities , even when times are tough . Second , entrepreneurship study courses would be oﬀered within schools and universities to promote the entrepreneurial culture at the national and international levels . Educators should provide assistance and conduct training programs for students and encourage curriculum projects that raise useful personal abilities to make entrepreneurial mindset at the university level . Third , according to this research , educators should provide students with online training and webinars that foster entrepreneurial purpose and urge them to start a new business while also considering the potential for future regret . Finally , entrepreneurial coaches should prosper to encourage aspiring entrepreneurs to think about the probability of regretting their inaction if it comes to pass .

COVID - 19 Perception to Entrepreneurial Behavior FIGURE 2 | Structural model . CONCLUSION This study is important in the current instant of international economic crisis as a consequence of COVID - 19 pandemic as it involves the production structures of many countries , which are at risk of an implosion in terms of economic growth , the most evident eﬀects of which they can already be seen in the processes of a reduction in the labor market of numerous employees , and by the increasing phenomena of discouragement and / or resignation from job participation , especially in younger generations . Our study found that the perception that university students have of the COVID - 19 pandemic is decreasing their intentions to start a business , with repercussions on their psychological needs . How can we solve this ? In our study , we have considered two personality traits that manifest themselves as keys to enhancing the intention to undertake in this speciﬁc situation , e . g . , proactiveness . This trait can dampen the eﬀect of COVID - 19’s negative perception on the intention to start a business , and also enhance the well - being and mental health of the young people to be able to start a new business . LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Future researchers can learn from our ﬁndings of the study’s limitations and potential directions for future research . We used an exploratory research design with a self - administered questionnaire and two waves of data collection from the respondents . According to Hernández - Sánchez et al . ( 2020 ) , the use of self - report data and one - or - two times collected data raises the question about the variation of the method . Therefore , longitudinal research might be conducted on these constructs to generalize the results in diﬀerent study settings . Second , we gathered data from the public and private sectors’ university students of Punjab , Pakistan , with minor sample size . We recommend that future researchers conduct an empirical study related to the impact of COVID - 19 pandemic on social entrepreneurship with the mediating eﬀect of resilience using diﬀerent country samples . Future research could also take COVID - 19 pandemic perception and cultural lifestyle on entrepreneurship .
