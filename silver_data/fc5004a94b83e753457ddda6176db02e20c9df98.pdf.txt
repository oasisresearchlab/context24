Recent theoretical studies and extensive data analyses have revealed a common feature displayed by bio - logical , social , and technological networks : the presence of small world patterns . Here we analyze this problem by using several graphs obtained from one of the most common technological systems : electronic circuits . It is shown that both analogic and digital circuits exhibit small world behavior . We conjecture that the small world pattern arises from the compact design in which many elements share a small , close physical neighborhood plus the fact that the system must deﬁne a single connected component ~ which requires shortcuts connecting different integrated clusters ! . The degree distributions displayed are consistent with a conjecture concerning the sharp cutoffs associated to the presence of costly connections @ Amaral et al . , Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 97 , 11 149 ~ 2000 ! # , thus providing a limit case for the classes of universality of small world patterns from real , artiﬁcial networks . The consequences for circuit design are outlined .

INTRODUCTION A class of disordered networks , the so - called small - world ~ SW ! networks @ 1 , 2 # , has been shown to be widespread in very different contexts , including molecular biology @ 3 , 4 # , neural nets @ 5 # , Internet topology @ 6 , 7 # , social and scientiﬁc collaboration networks @ 8 – 11 # , ecosystems @ 12 , 13 # , or the human language @ 14 # . The presence of SW patterns might provide new , unsuspected clues to the origins of complex networks and to some of their intrinsic emergent properties . These properties would include their evolvability , robustness against external ﬂuctuations or their fragility against unex - pected sources of challenge @ 15 , 12 # . The observation that some of these systems , with a very different origin , display similar statistical features @ 7 # , allows one to develop theoret - ical models inspired in some methods of statistical mechan - ics in which the details of the units are not explicitly in - cluded . Electronic circuits can be viewed as networks in which vertices ~ or nodes ! are electronic components ~ e . g . , logic gates in digital circuits and resistors , capacitors , diodes , and so on in analogic circuits ! and connections ~ or edges ! are wires in a broad sense . The evolution of electronic circuits underwent two fundamental events for our concerns . First , there is the birth of digital circuits replacing and extending the capabilities of analogic circuits . Second , there is integra - tion , allowing one to reduce the size of electronic equipment maintaining the same functionality . As a result , the construc - tion of larger circuits was favored . As far as we know , no systematic analysis of the resulting topology has been per - formed . Using the formalism of graph theory , any of these nets can be described in terms of a graph V , deﬁned as a pair , V 5 ( W , E ) , where W 5 $ w i % , ( i 5 1 , . . . , N ) is the set of N nodes and E 5 $ $ w i , w j % % is the set of edges or connections between nodes . Here j ij 5 $ w i , w j % indicates that there is an edge ~ and thus a link ! between nodes w i and w j . Two con - nected nodes are called adjacent , and the degree of a given node is the number of edges connecting it with other nodes . The SW pattern can be detected from an analysis of two basic statistical properties : the so called clustering coefﬁcient C and the path length d . Let us consider a set of links j ij ( i , j 5 1 , . . . , N ) , where j ij 5 1 if a link exists and zero oth - erwise and that the average number of links per node is ^ k & . Let us indicate by G i 5 $ j u j ij 5 1 % the set of nearest neighbors of a node w i P W . The clustering coefﬁcient for this node is deﬁned as the number of connections between the compo - nents w j P G i . By deﬁning L i 5 ( j 5 1 N j ij F ( k P G i ; j , k j jk G , ~ 1 ! we have C v ( i ) 5 L i / ( 2 u G i u ) , so that the clustering coefﬁcient is the average over W , C 5 1 N ( i 5 1 N C v ~ i ! , ~ 2 ! and measures the average fraction of pairs of neighbors of a node that are also neighbors of each other . The second measure is easily deﬁned . Given two nodes w i , w j P W , let d min ( i , j ) be the minimum path length con - necting these two nodes in V . The average path length of a given unit will be d v ~ i ! 5 1 N ( j 5 1 N d min ~ i , j ! , ~ 3 ! and the path length is d 5 ^ d v ( i ) & . Graphs with a small world structure are highly clustered , but d will be small . Random graphs ~ where nodes are ran - domly wired ! are not clustered , and also have short d @ 1 # .

A regular lattice can be transformed into a SW if a small fraction of nodes are rewired to ran - domly chosen nodes . Thus a small degree of disorder gener - ates short paths ~ as in the random case ! retaining the regular pattern @ 2 # . For random graphs , C rand ’ ^ k & / N . For SW graphs , d is close to the one expected from random graphs , d rand , with the same ^ k & and C @ C rand . An additional property of these graphs is their degree dis - tribution P ( k ) . This is deﬁned as the ~ normalized ! frequency of nodes having k edges . The analysis of different real sys - tems reveals different types of small - world network patterns @ 8 # , possibly deﬁning a ﬁnite set of universality classes . All of these seem to share a remarkable deviation from what one would expect from a totally random graph . Three different types of distributions were recently suggested to represent most of the observed patterns : ~ i ! scale - free networks , in which P ( k ) ’ k 2 g ; ~ ii ! broad - scale networks , i . e . , graphs with sharp cutoffs in their power - law degree distributions P ( k ) ’ k 2 g f ( k / k * ) , where k * gives the cutoff ; and ~ iii ! single - scale distributions ~ either exponential or Gaussian ! . These distributions have been suggested to share some non - trivial features with other analogous systems from the theory of critical phenomena @ 8 # . Amaral et al . @ 8 # recently conjectured that the shape of these distributions might result from the presence ~ or ab - sence ! of constraints limiting the number of links when con - nections are costly . In this sense , the presence of exponential decays or sharp cutoffs would be a consequence of costly wiring . Costly wiring should be especially obvious in tech - nological networks in which connections between elements involve hardware . In this context two different types of graphs have been analyzed : the Internet @ 7 , 16 # and the elec - tric power grid @ 2 , 1 , 8 # . In this paper we consider a third , obvious example of a technological network where such con - straints should operate : electronic circuits . This is an especially interesting system for three reasons : ~ a ! It involves a graph in which efﬁcient design relies to a large extent on connecting large groups of elements using different short - range links , and regular clusters connected through a small amount of short cuts . In this sense , they are much closer to the Watts - Strogatz original model than any other system . ~ b ! Since technological innovation has pushed these systems toward minimization of hardware connections , clear deviations from long - tailed distributions should be ex - pected , according to Amaral et al . ’s conjecture . ~ c ! If rel - evant topological properties ~ such as the SW architecture ! are present in these circuits , then future design strategies might ﬁnd ways to optimize their tolerance to failure ~ which is very high in standard hardware devices ! . The paper is organized as follows : In Sec . II we present evidence of such SW patterns in electronic circuits , as well as an analysis of their degree distributions . It is shown that the similarity between electronic circuits and ecological sys - tems might be stronger than been pointed above . Such results and their consequences are outlined in Sec . III . II . RESULTS We ﬁrst performed a preliminary analysis of the basic features exhibited by old analogic designs , using available data @ 17 , 18 # . These networks were used in order to test other types of hypothesis concerning the diversity of different components in a circuit and their average connectivity , to be compared with data from ecological systems . An example of the graph obtained for one of these circuits ~ a TV circuit ! is shown @ 19 # in Fig . 1 . We can see that the graph is highly nonrandom , as one would expect from a designed network . Some components are highly connected , but most of them have a small degree . This graph has a SW structure , with C 5 0 . 34 @ C rand 5 0 . 019 and d 5 3 . 17 ’ d rand 5 3 . 13 . The degree distribution for the three largest networks N ’ 350 , analyzed in Refs . @ 17 , 18 # , is shown in Fig . 2 ~ A ! . A characteristic maximum at k c 5 4 can be seen ~ with an aver - age connectivity ^ k & ’ 5 ) . This is not surprising , since a minimum of two links is typically expected ~ except for input or output units ! and the analogic system is built on a two - dimensional substrate , thus favoring topological arrange - ments characteristic of a two - dimensional square lattice . The observation of a degree distribution centered around k c and having a sharp cutoff at k * ’ 25 – 30 gives support to Amaral et al . ’s conjecture concerning the limitations imposed by costly wiring . For comparison , we also show ~ dashed line ! the expected distribution for a purely random ~ Poisson dis - tributed ! system with the same average connectivity . It can be seen that the actual distribution strongly deviates from the Poissonian . For small k it is easily understood due to the obvious limitations imposed by the circuit wiring . At larger k , however , it is remarkable to see that the cut off occurs at much higher values . Although these distributions are not long tailed , we indicate the power - law ﬁt gives an exponent g’ 2 . 5 . Our second set of circuits provides a better understanding of how these graphs are organized in digital circuits . This set contains benchmark circuits ~ from the so - called ISCAS’89 and ITC’99 sets @ 20 # ! . The degree distribution of two large logic circuits N ’ 10 4 is shown in Fig . 2 ~ c ! . FIG . 1 .

When looking at Fig . 2 ~ d ! we again observe the tendency towards a power - law tail with a sharp cutoff . The estimated exponent is close to g’ 3 @ 21 # . It is interesting that this value is close to the one obtained from the Baraba´si - Albert model @ 7 # , and this might have interesting consequences for circuit design ~ see below ! . Circuits in the ISCAS’89 / ITC’99 set are formed by com - ponents ~ chieﬂy gates ! having two connections ~ one input and one ouput as in NOT gates and D - type ﬂipﬂops ! and three connections ~ two inputs and one output as in AND2 and OR2 gates ! . It is straightforward that ^ k & > 2 . If components made use of the minimum number of connections ~ as it is expected due to optimizations in the logical design ! , it should be true that 2 < , k . < 3 . In contrast , the value of ^ k & averaged over all the circuits in the ISCAS’89 / ITC’99 set is 3 . 65 . All gates have one single output and few inputs . Since an input wire must receive input from only one single output wire ~ except external input ! , ^ k & . 3 can only be obtained by making a gate to deliver its output to more than one different inputs . The question is why high values of ^ k & ~ i . e . , ^ k & @ 4 ) are not found . Will such values be redundant in a way that logical optimization cannot tolerate ? Is it necessary to go beyond ^ k & 5 3 for the circuit to perform a nontrivial task ? Two pre - dictions from random graph topologies will be used in order to compare them against the observed topological patterns exhibited by the benchmark circuits . ~ 1 !

TOPOLOGY OF TECHNOLOGY GRAPHS : SMALL WORLD . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 64 046119 046119 - 3 magnitude are achieved by the largest circuits while d / d rand remains in the same order of magnitude for whatever size of the network . There are some exceptions to C / C rand . 1 which can be attributed to the fact that the ISCAS’89 / ITC’99 sets are intended as benchmarks . In this respect , a reduced number of circuits are not described at the lowest level , and some others have been modiﬁed with the insertion of extra components . These two factors are likely to reduce cluster - ing . Nonetheless , the small - worldness of the circuits increases with the size of the circuit . From the industrial point of view , technological advance allowed circuits to grow in size . As the size increased , building circuits from scratch became un - approachable . It thus became necessary to build complex cir - cuits using other basic circuits . On the one hand , these basic circuits have a reduced number of inputs and output wirings in comparison with their internal connections , so they are likely to be responsible for the high values of clustering ob - served . On the other hand it is known that a small number of wires interconnecting highly clustered units ~ according to Watt’s model @ 2 # ! is enough for showing the small - world phenomenon at the high level . III . DISCUSSION Design of electronic circuits is divided into logical design and physical design @ 22 # . The former speciﬁes the network ~ components and connections ! , and the latter speciﬁes the precise physical realization of the system in a particular tech - nology . Optimization is present at both stages . Automatic methods of algebraic simpliﬁcation are responsible for ob - taining circuits having a minimal number of components in the logic design @ 23 # ~ for optimization at the physical level , see Ref . @ 22 # ! . This simpliﬁcation is likely to be the origin of the low clustering attained in one half of the circuits ana - lyzed . Simpliﬁed combinatorial circuits have the form of hi - erarchical networks ~ propagating inputs to the output without backward connections ! , which might explain such low clus - tering . It has been shown that if vertices in a network are physically placed on a ring , minimizing the logic distance ~ the distance between vertices in the graph ! and the physical distance ~ the Euclidean distance between vertices ! leads to small - world patterns @ 24 # . Electronic circuits constitute an example of manmade ar - tifacts that have evolved towards nonrandom conﬁgurations in which minimization of both average path length and physical distance are present . Because of their particular de - sign , standard electronic devices are highly error prone : a single failure in one component typically leads to system failure . This is not the case of biological systems , in which networks displaying highly heterogeneous degree distribu - tions with long tails have been shown to be particularly re - silient @ 15 # . Of course the difference comes largely from the dynamical pattern of interactions among units . Redundancy and modularity can help to overcome failure of a single unit by ﬁnding appropriate pathways able to substitute the dam - aged unit . Is there any analogous scenario within our con - text ? How reliable systems can be built from unreliable com - ponents has been a very important topic since Von Neu - mann’s @ 25 # and McCulloch @ 26 # pioneering work . Using formal approaches borrowed from automata theory and sta - tistical mechanics , these authors concluded that some amount of redundancy is required in order to satisfy a num - ber of lower bounds of system functioning . One interesting framework in which our results might help to provide new ways of generating reliable circuits is the emerging area of adaptive and evolutionary hardware @ 27 , 28 # . A new genera - tion of electronic devices is based on the possibility of re - conﬁguration of the circuits wiring @ 29 # . Self - reconﬁguration is needed to endow devices with the ﬂexibility of in situ challenges and an adaptation to unforeseen conditions , that also possess an enhanced fault tolerance . This is the case , for example , of planetary space missions . The idea behind the evolutionary synthesis of electronic circuits is to employ an evolutionary and genetic algorithm to control the search for a circuit ~ through a potentially vast parameter space ! that satisﬁes speciﬁed objectives . The evo - lutionary algorithm selects a population of potential designs , coded as bit strings conﬁgurations , and downloads them to the reconﬁgurable chip . Evolved circuits can have some ﬂex - ibility which might allow them to work safely under different FIG . 4 . Small world patterns in networks : distance ~ a ! and clus - tering ~ b ! for the circuits in the ISCAS’89 / ITC’99 are shown . Real distance is corrected by a factor of log ^ k & and clustering by ^ k & . Dashed lines correspond to the values expected for random graphs , i . e . , C rand / ^ k & and d rand log ^ k & , respectively . It can be seen that larger circuits involve larger deviations from the random cases . CANCHO , JANSSEN , AND SOLE´ PHYSICAL REVIEW E 64 046119 046119 - 4 sources of noise or damage . One possible constraint to be introduced into an evolutionary search would be inspired by the properties displayed by biological systems showing a SW topology . Searching for circuits with SW structure and / or long - tailed distributions of links might give some new in - sight into the origins of the SW behavior in both natural and artiﬁcial systems . The fact that the observed degree distribu - tions of real designs are already power laws allows one to conjecture the possibility of reaching high levels of robust - ness against the random failure of units under an appropriate level of redundancy .
