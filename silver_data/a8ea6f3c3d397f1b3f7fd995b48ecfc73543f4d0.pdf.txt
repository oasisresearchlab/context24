Measures to maintain regular operations and prevent outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 in childcare facilities or schools under pandemic conditions and co - circulation of other respiratory pathogens Maßnahmen zur Aufrechterhaltung eines Regelbetriebs und zur Prävention von SARS - CoV - 2 - Ausbrüchen in Einrichtungen der Kindertagesbetreuung oder Schulen unter Bedingungen der Pandemie und Kozirkulation weiterer Erreger von Atemwegserkrankungen Abstract After the lockdown and the end of the summer holidays , day - cares and schools need to be reopened and ( despite the continued circulation of Arne Simon 1 Johannes Huebner 2 the new coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 ) kept open . The need for opening up Reinhard Berner 3 arises from the right of children to education , participation , support and Alasdair P . S . Munro 4 , 5 care . This is possible if appropriate hygiene measures are implemented and community transmission remains stable . In addition , the safety of Martin Exner 6 educators , teachers and carers must be a priority and needs to be ad - Hans - Iko Huppertz 7 dressed by appropriate measures . Finally , the needs of families must Peter Walger 8 also be taken into account . The following document describes in detail how these objectives can be achieved .

All those involved are called upon to actively partici - pate in scientific studies . In comparison to adults , children and adolescents have , based on the findings to date • a lower frequency of infection [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] ( some , but by far not all studies were conducted during the lockdown , which is a methodological limitation ) ; • a lower average severity of disease and associated with this ; • a significantly lower risk of the most serious , including fatal , courses ; • from CoVID - 19 [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . There is also evidence that children and adolescents ( at least up to 14 years ) [ 25 ] transmit SARS - CoV - 2 to other people less frequently than adults [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] . The data for children up to the age of 10 seem to indicate that their role for transmission dynamics is less important than for adolescents aged 14 and more [ 25 ] , [ 33 ] . The scientific publications since the end of May 2020 have confirmed the recommendations of the statement of several medical societies [ 34 ] , even though discussions on the effectiveness of individual non - pharmaceutical measures continue [ 35 ] . According to the authors ' current assessment , teachers in schools and staff in day - care facilities have only a low risk of infection through contact with potentially infected children if basic hygiene mea - sures are adhered to [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] . This risk is not increased compared to the risk of infection through contact with adult SARS - CoV - 2 - infected people in public or private settings [ 25 ] . The currently available data speak in favour of a strategy of future prevention concepts differentiated according to the age of the children and adolescents in order to min - imise the risk of infection events , to limit them and to prevent the blanket closure of day - care centres and schools as a first measure [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] . Continuous attendance at a day - care centre [ 41 ] or school is not only essential for the sustainable educational success of the next generation , but also for healthy and successful de - velopment through social contacts , developmental tasks and challenges [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . In addition , it leads to a relief of the families and also to a release of the la - bour force of the persons having custody ( compared to the continuous care of small children at home or the digital home - schooling of school children ) [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] . In order to enable day - care centres and schools to operate on a regular basis as far as possible , in addition to the measures mentioned below it is necessary to develop a concept that allows [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] 1 . to distinguish respiratory infections caused by season - al viral pathogens from those caused by SARS - CoV - 2 using a risk - adapted testing strategy 2 . to rapidly detect changes in the incidence of infection through a combination of tests based on specific risk factors ( e . g . by taking into account holiday and travel risks , social history , membership of risk groups ) and , if necessary , scientifically accompanied by sentinel examinations with involvement of carers and teachers ; 3 . to gain an overview of the developing epidemiological situation in small social niches ( schools , day - care centres , districts ) and to follow it regionally in order to be able to react in a timely and targeted ( i . e . con - tainment ) manner ; 4 . making organisational arrangements to prevent the uncontrolled spread of infections within the facility . These concepts must be discussed in advance with the public health department . The possible contact persons in the event of an incident should be deter - mined in advance . Parents , teachers , educators and carers should be informed in advance about the measures and their background ; 5 . to carry out structured outbreak investigations of clustered outbreaks in schools , day - care centres and municipalities in accordance with the general estab - lished principles of structured outbreak management by outbreak teams . The RKI has published guidelines for such a coordinated approach [ 55 ] . This guideline requires ( as of 31 . 07 . 2020 ) a detailed update for the management of outbreaks in day - care centres and schools . This concept must be regularly updated in the light of the continuing pandemic situation and adapted in line with new findings . 2 / 12 GMS Hygiene and Infection Control 2020 , Vol . 15 , ISSN 2196 - 5226 Simon et al . : Measures to maintain regular operations and prevent . . . The overall objective is to enable children and young people to attend day - care centres and schools in the fu - ture and to avoid a complete lockdown situation . At the same time , a safe working environment and adequate protection against infection should be prioritized for educators and teachers ( and other adult contact persons involved in the facilities ) . This also applies to the families of the children , teachers and care personnel . Maintenance of regular operations and prevention of SARS - CoV - 2 out - breaks in day - care centres and schools Almost without exception , the complete closure of day - care centers and schools as part of pandemic manage - ment was justified as a preventive measure . Reports of outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 in day - care centres or schools include lists of a few cases of infection in which mostly teachers or other personnel were the source of infec - tion [ 40 ] , [ 56 ] . Less frequently , individual children or stu - dents whose parents were also often sick and were con - sidered vectors [ 31 ] , [ 57 ] . Children have so far not ap - peared as so - called “superspreaders” in schools and day - care centres or within families [ 29 ] , [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] , [ 61 ] . A more detailed analysis of the transmission paths in terms of a structured outbreak analysis is missing . Most of the so - called outbreaks are accumulations of in - fections with smaller numbers of cases , the cause of which was outside the day - care centres or schools . There is no well - founded scientific evidence of an increased risk of transmission at day - care centres and schools , al - though it should be noted that the majority of the cluster events reported were carried out in a lockdown situation and many reports only refer to reports in local media [ 40 ] . The re - opening of day - care centres and schools has not led to an increase in the number of infections among children and adolescents in any of the countries in which a general decline in infections in the general population has been observed and in which basic prevention measures in the general population have been further pursued ( e . g . distance , cloth face masks , basic infection control rules ) . Accordingly , the risk for teachers and care personnel to become infected through contacts in day - care and school operations – despite appropriate preven - tive measures – remained low . In countries in which outbreaks in schools were reported ( e . g . Israel , Sweden or the USA ) , the number of infections in the general population was rising , in some cases signi - ficantly , so that the question of the causal relationships between infections in pupils through private or school transmissions and the cause of the infections in care - givers or staff remained unanswered [ 38 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 56 ] . Other aspects of specific risks in children and adoles - cents , such as the membership of families in population groups with religiously or ideologically motivated rejection of the hygiene measures [ 59 ] , [ 62 ] or contradictory re - commendations of the responsible health authorities with a simultaneously increased risk of mobility ( USA ) [ 63 ] , [ 64 ] also make it difficult to draw general conclusions about the role of children and adolescents . The authors of a recent report on an outbreak at a secondary school in Israel emphasize that in the overcrowded school classes ( > 30 pupils ) , the wearing of mouth and nose covers and frequent airing were not consistently adhered to due to the high outside temperatures ( 40°C and more ) ( the air conditioning system was constantly in operation with no information on air exchange rates ) [ 65 ] . Cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection also occur in community facilities or schools in Germany and other European countries . It can be assumed , however , that the incidence in day - care centres and schools is generally lower than the general incidence in the associated district . Incidence data ( Incidence here means the cumulative number [ mean value ] of new cases reported daily over the last 7 days per 100 , 000 inhabitants in the respective district ; see Table 1 ) apply to counties or municipalities . However , if a local outbreak can be controlled in a nar - rowly defined area , an increased incidence overall ( in the district , the municipality ) does not automatically mean that the prevention strategy in schools and day - care centres has to be adjusted ( or that they have to be closed down completely ) . Through a timely and targeted adapta - tion ( escalation ) of preventive measures with separation of children and caregivers / teachers regarding location and time , ideally , when SARS - CoV - 2 infections occur in day - care centres and schools , only the cluster directly affected ( group / class , grade level ) should be temporarily quarantined . However , this decision is the responsibility of the local health authority . Maintenance of regular operation with risk - based protection of staff in day - care centres and schools The aim of the measures described below is to minimize the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in day - care centres and schools . In everyday life , the prevention of any infection would be desirable , but probably cannot succeed and is therefore not the overall strategic goal . Such events cannot be completely ruled out , just as the entry of these infections into the facilities by the adults working there cannot be ruled out . The prevention of every single SARS - CoV - 2 infection is not a realistic goal of a prevention strategy in which social life ( and the age - and develop - ment - appropriate participation of children and adoles - cents ) is maintained . The staff’s anxieties resulting from this situation must be taken seriously . It requires specific measures that are the responsibility of the respective institutions . The lower risk of disease and transmission in children is accompa - nied by a lower risk of infection for teaching and care personnel if the basic hygiene rules described below are observed [ 25 ] . 3 / 12 GMS Hygiene and Infection Control 2020 , Vol . 15 , ISSN 2196 - 5226 Simon et al . : Measures to maintain regular operations and prevent . . . Table 1 : Measures for children and adolescents in primary and secondary schools The risk of infection can be considerably minimized by a bundle of prevention measures . With regard to their im - plementation in day - care centres , explicit reference is made to the current version of the DAKJ’s Early Care and Child Health Commission [ 66 ] , [ 67 ] . Teachers and educators are of paramount importance for the unrestricted access of children and adolescents to age - appropriate education and developmental oppor - tunities within groups , classes and courses . Their daily work is not only relevant to the system but also to the future of our society [ 52 ] , [ 68 ] , [ 69 ] . The vast majority of the educational and teaching staff in day - care centres and schools are well aware of this , and they strive to fulfil their tasks with commitment even in these difficult and stressful times . Occupational health Fears of infection among staff in day - care centres and schools should be addressed through professional edu - cation and advice . Fears should not lead to employees identifying as belonging to a “risk group” and withdrawing from their official duties without a definitive medical reason . This would expose children and adolescents and their families to the risk of considerable collateral damage [ 70 ] , [ 71 ] , [ 72 ] . An assessment by an occupational health physician [ 73 ] in consultation with the primary care physician is preferable to a self - assessment regarding the risk of increased vulnerability in the case of a SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 4 / 12 GMS Hygiene and Infection Control 2020 , Vol . 15 , ISSN 2196 - 5226 Simon et al . : Measures to maintain regular operations and prevent . . . Preventive measures of the staff Based on the general ( regional ) and specific ( within the institution ) epidemiological situation , the following pre - ventive measures must be taken by staff to protect themselves and others ( prevention bundle ) [ 74 ] : • Observance of the infection control rules also in the private setting Keeping distance whenever possible , especially to other adults and adolescents ( i . e . communal areas for teachers or educators ) . • Washing hands , in special situations also hand disinfection . • Wearing a cloth face mask mask if distance rules cannot be observed [ 75 ] . • • Regular airing at the end of each school hour ( or hourly in day - care centres ) , if necessary with additional mea - surement of the CO 2 content of the room air in special cases according to national recommendations ( DGVU : https : / / dguv . de / corona - bildung / schulen / index . jsp ) ; if necessary , critical assessment of rooms with air conditioning with regard to the proportion of fresh air or recirculated air ( see footnote 4 in Table 1 ) . • Early recognition of relevant symptoms in oneself , in colleagues and in the children and adolescents . The necessary consequences should be drawn promptly . • Close communication ( in strict compliance with the hygiene rules ) among each other and cooperation of the institutional management with the local authorities . • Active involvement of children and adolescents [ 76 ] , parents ( guardians ) and their representatives in the overall concept of the respective institution . Parents are responsible for their children and indirectly also for the safe operation of the institution visited by their children ( see below ) . Before the complete closure of an institution [ 40 ] , the escalation of preventive measures ( see Table 1 ) is an essential prerequisite for maintaining unrestricted or partially restricted regular operation . Outbreak prevention , management and measures Due to the increasing evidence on the limited role of children ( and probably also of adolescents up to 14 years of age ) in the dynamics of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the following advice should be taken into account and measures for day - care and school operation should be implemented : 1 . An open , public discussion should lead to the accep - tance of the fact that under pandemic conditions the elimination of any residual risk ( the avoidance of every single SARS - CoV - 2 infection without excep - tion ) is not possible in everyday life and therefore cannot be the overriding strategic goal . It is neces - sary to learn how to deal with SARS - CoV - 2 infections and to minimize the risk of a local outbreak . 2 . The normal operation of day - care centres and schools is possible in regions with a low incidence ( Table 1 ) of SARS - CoV - 2 infections / COVID - 19 cases while maintaining defined basic infection control standards . 3 . Setting - specific conditions must receive special at - tention . Overall , the spectrum ranges from family - like structures in day - care to colleges with four - digit numbers of pupils . 4 . Cancellation or restriction of regular operations re - quires a well - founded , structured and transparent political decision - making process , which focuses on safeguarding the educational , social and psycholo - gical interests of children and pupils while taking into account the risks of infection and illness . In particular , the interests of children and adolescents with special educational needs , special needs or supportive needs must be taken into account at least as much as those of other children and adolescents [ 42 ] , [ 66 ] , [ 67 ] , [ 68 ] , [ 74 ] , [ 77 ] . This political process needs to be scientifically monitored . In most regions , it is possible to draw on the special expertise of paediatricians from various subdisciplines ( including Paediatric Infectious Diseases ) as well as infection control and environmental hygienists . 5 . A complete closure of day - care centres or schools for reasons of preventive health protection or solely due to the accumulation of infections in the general population of a certain region without a definitive risk for the school or day - care centre is not justified . 6 . Deviations from normal operation may become necessary due to an increasing incidence in a region or a defined outbreak . This planning should not happen at the time it becomes necessary but well in advance and these deviations must follow a step - by - step concept to be agreed upon with the respon - sible public health department . The complete closure of the entire facility should only be the last option if all other measured have failed . 7 . When individual cases of infection occur in children , adolescents or persons of the care or teaching staff or in their immediate family or social environment , the primary goal is to limit the occurrence of infection to the defined area of a day - care group , a school class , or a course system . This is achieved by intensi - fying practised and previously established infection control rules , organising school operations according to constant group formation ( cohorting ) and prescrib - ing defined quarantine measures or temporary closures of sub - areas . 8 . In the higher class levels the fixed group formation may not be maintained due to requirements of course systems ( i . e . no fixed classes or groups ) . On the other hand , these adolescents / young adults are quite capable of consistently implementing general infection prevention measures . Other forms of 5 / 12 GMS Hygiene and Infection Control 2020 , Vol . 15 , ISSN 2196 - 5226 Simon et al . : Measures to maintain regular operations and prevent . . . teaching can be offered here in addition to classroom teaching ( e . g . digital learning ) . 9 . Even in the event of infection clusters , cluster isola - tion should have priority over the closure of entire institutions . In cooperation with the responsible public health department , an infection control concept needs to be developed and agreed in ad - vance , even before the facility is opened , to deter - mine the procedures to be followed in individual cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infections or outbreaks in an institution . A committee ( outbreak and / or prevention team ) of the school or day - care centre coordinated by the management of the facility is responsible for this . 10 . When cases of infection occur , the ultimately respon - sible public health department , in cooperation with the institutional management , carries out a struc - tured outbreak management . This involves an analysis of the transmission pathways according to established medical criteria ( see RKI guidelines [ 55 ] ) and the development of an adapted action plan for the specific case as well as testing the cohort regard - less of symptoms to prevent subsequent asympto - matic transmission . 11 . Complete day - care centre and school closures can only be a final step in the outbreak management if there has been an increase in transmission within the respective institution that cannot be contained by other measures . 12 . While the institution management is an important partner , the local health authority is in charge . The involvement of representatives of educators , teach - ers , parents and children / adolescents should be part of the outbreak management . 13 . The self - evaluation of teachers and other personnel as a risk group should be abandoned in favour of occupational health advice and assessment . The Committee for Occupational Medicine [ 78 ] , considers the existence of defined pre - existing conditions without a defined age limit as a key criterion . 14 . A general recommendation for teaching or care personnel to wear a daily mask during an outbreak should always be the most important step before a complete closure of a day - care centre or school . Irre - spective of this , the rules of compulsory masks for older children and adolescents [ 75 ] , [ 79 ] , [ 80 ] , [ 81 ] , [ 82 ] , [ 83 ] , [ 84 ] as well as for teaching and care personnel in defined situations are part of preventive infection protection ( see Table 1 and Table 2 ) . 15 . The infection control concepts are based on the age of the pupils and the regional incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections ( see Table 1 and Table 2 ) . They are based on and supplement the institution - related hygiene plans of the respective federal states . An age limit of 10 years is considered reasonable , al - though this limit is blurred between a clearly low risk of transmission and illness in under 10 - year - olds and an increasing risk behaviour and thus a growing transmission risk in the over - 14 - year - olds . 16 . It is not possible for educators in day - care centres to adhere to distance rules and to wear a cloth face mask throughout the day when there is close contact with the children . Visors are no substitute for an MNB , but they can be used in different ways and should be preferred to not using a cloth face mask at all . Further measures 1 . Establishment of easily accessible SARS - CoV - 2 testing facilities for children , adolescents , caregivers and teachers , in order to enable rapid return to care facil - ities and workplaces without restrictions in the event of negative results . 2 . Provide opportunities for testing on an ad hoc basis depending on aspects of special risks associated with travel , regional cluster events , special risks from family or social environment of children and pupils or other anamnestic evidence of special risks . 3 . Symptom - independent sentinel SARS - CoV - 2 studies in specific populations ( in the context of scientific or scientifically supervised studies ) to detect and prevent increased virus spread pre - emptively before manifest cases of disease occur . 4 . Testing of sentinel populations ( e . g . hospitalised children ) with respiratory tract infections for respira - tory viruses using multiplex PCR to map the general epidemiology of respiratory infectious diseases in a region ( see also : https : / / influenza . rki . de / ) . 5 . Ensuring vaccination for pupils and teachers or carers through active counselling and low - threshold vaccina - tion programmes . As a result , other ( vaccine - prevent - able ) infections , which are often clinically indistinguish - able from SARS - CoV - 2 infections , become less fre - quent [ 85 ] . Testing for SARS - CoV - 2 in children in an outpatient treatment context These instructions apply to children under 10 years of age . For older children and adolescents the relevant re - commendations ( https : / / www . rki . de / DE / Content / InfAZ / N / Neuartiges _ Coronavirus / Massnahmen _ Verdachtsfall _ Infografik _ DINA3 . pdf ? _ _ blob = publicationFile ) apply . Sensitive methods for sample collection ( e . g . saliva samples ) [ 86 ] should be developed and validated as an alternative to the deep nasopharyngeal swab in children . Especially the deep nasal swab is very unpleasant for children and , depending on the age of the child , also traumatizing . In addition , the difficulties in obtaining material , especially for infants and toddlers , limit the validity of the results . In autumn and winter 2020 , the usual significant ( seasonal ) increase in upper respiratory tract infections in children and adolescents can be expec - ted . The seasonal occurrence of these infections can also 6 / 12 GMS Hygiene and Infection Control 2020 , Vol . 15 , ISSN 2196 - 5226 Simon et al . : Measures to maintain regular operations and prevent . . . Table 2 : Measures in day - care centres and kindergarden be expected under the conditions of partial restriction of public life . A distinction between a symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion and infections caused by other pathogens is not possible solely on the basis of clinical findings and exam - ination . A general testing of all symptomatic children and adoles - cents for SARS - CoV - 2 is unrealistic for logistical and ca - pacity reasons [ 87 ] . In addition , if the prevalence in the investigated group is low , false - positive results could outweigh the correct positive results , with the con - sequence of additional retesting or expensive sequencing , or even lockdowns or quarantine measures , which under - mine the confidence in hygiene management . The indication for a SARS - CoV - 2 test should be individually justified based on the criteria listed below . Tests within the framework of scientific epidemiological studies or sentinel investigations as well as investigations within the framework of structured outbreak management should be evaluated separately . Early information of parents about this background is recommended . Sick children or adolescents in a reduced general condi - tion with fever , cough , sore throat or ear pain , severe abdominal pain , vomiting , diarrhoea or an unclear skin rash do not belong in either the day - care or school . Insti - tutions are therefore entitled to have children or adoles - cents who have fallen ill being collected by their parents or guardians and to suggest a visit to a doctor . The request for a SARS - CoV - 2 test is made by a physician ( according to the criteria below ) or by the health author - ities . Institutions ( schools , day - care centres etc . ) are not entitled to demand a test ( or the presentation of a neg - ative test result ) . A medical certificate for readmission is only required if the child has been in quarantine due to COVID - 19 , a SARS - CoV - 2 detection without symptoms or a Category 1 contact ( according to RKI : https : / / www . rki . de / DE / Content / InfAZ / N / Neuar tiges _ Coronavirus / Kontaktperson / Management . html ) with a SARS - CoV - 2 positive person . Furthermore , institutions are not entitled to request a “negative test” as a condition for re - entry . Children with mild self - limiting signs of infection ( mild cold without fever , only mild cough ; these children mainly cough in the morning because the secretion runs down their throats at night ) or after a short period of illness ( less than 3 days ) may be readmitted without a medical certificate if they are in good general condition and their symptoms have subsided . Some states have adopted the 7 / 12 GMS Hygiene and Infection Control 2020 , Vol . 15 , ISSN 2196 - 5226 Simon et al . : Measures to maintain regular operations and prevent . . . pragmatic solution whereby parents have to confirm in writing to the day - care centre that their child was free of symptoms for 24 hours before being readmitted . For the coming year , it is recommended that such procedural arrangements be included in the care agreement between parents and facilities , thereby achieving commitment and certainty of action . A test for SARS - CoV - 2 infection in an outpatient context should be carried out : • For children with reduced general condition and symptoms of infection , such as fever ( sustained oral or rectal body temperature above 38°C or once above 38 . 5°C ) or coughing for more than 2 days , children with gastrointestinal symptoms ( persistent severe ab - dominal pain with or without diarrhoea and vomiting ) , unless there is no other explanation ( as assessed by a physician ) . • By order of the local health authorities ( e . g . for tracing chains of infection ) children living in the same house - hold with a person who is infected with SARS - CoV - 2 do not have to be necessarily tested , but remain in quarantine . This is decided by the public health depart - ment [ 87 ] . Testing for SARS - CoV - 2 infection in an outpatient context is not required in children in good general health with : • Rhinorrhoea ( runny nose ) or blocked nasal breathing with or without cough ( without fever ; yellowish or greenish secretion does not give a reliable indication as to whether the infection is bacterial or viral . ) • Mild self - limiting infection of less than 3 days ( see above ) • clear diagnosis of a bacterial infection ( e . g . tonsillo - pharyngitis caused by A - streptococci , urinary tract in - fection , skin and soft tissue infections ) after clinical improvement and antibiotic therapy or other infection Note The information on the test criteria corresponds to the status as of 03 . 08 . 2020 and may change depending on the epidemiological situation and new scientific findings .
