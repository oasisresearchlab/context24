These applications are no longer perceived as distant , instrumental entities , but ofer a more afective and intimate experience . In this paper , we address the long - term experience of living with a digital contraception technology that utilizes self - tracking . We draw upon four design workshops with a total of 14 users of the app Natural Cycles to illustrate moments of ambivalent afects and oscillating relations . Based on our analysis , we concretize four dimensions of ambivalence in diferent scales and temporalities . We propose three strategies of designing with these unavoidable disruptions , conficting feelings , and shifting relations to acknowledge users’ agentic engagements , nuanced dynamics of intimate self - tracking experiences , and users as embodied and afective beings . We contend that by attending to these existential ambivalences , digital contraceptive can become better confgured to plural modes of life and long - term intimate relations that they engender .

This paper focuses on Digital Contraception as a class of intimate technology . Digital contraceptives are medical digital tools that utilize self - tracking technologies to estimate ovulation and there - fore periods of fertility . What is striking about digital contraception is the long - term use and systematic tracking that are required to predict the fertile window with enough precision to maintain user satisfaction [ 24 ] . This creates a compelling context of study from the perspective of HCI and user experience research . For example , their long - term use often means that digital contraceptive are used across multiple life transitions : a digital contraceptive can also be used to track menstruation across the reproductive years ; it may be used for several decades as a form of contraception ; and in other periods it can also be used as a tool to support conception . As such , examining digital contraception from the perspective of user expe - rience ofers the feld a unique opportunity to study the long - term relationships that might occur between a user and a technology , and in particular to investigate the fuctuations that such relationships undergo . Recent research has showcased that as algorithmic and self - tracking technologies have got closer to our bodies and private spaces , the ‘intimate horizons’ of human - technological relation - ships have become equally important as their instrumental horizons [ 60 , 74 , 78 ] . In other words , algorithmic technologies are no longer perceived by their users as distant or utilitarian entities . Instead they create more afective engagements . Previous studies of fertility tracking technologies support this conceptualization . For example , a recent study highlighted that these intimate technologies provide 416 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Park , et al . a deep sense of empowerment to their users , with for example , users reporting to have learned things from these technologies about their bodies that have often been missing from their formal education [ 41 ] . Yet , the proliferation of digital technologies that track individuals also comes with a sense of unease . The discomfort and disturbance produced by self - tracking technologies that surveil users and fail to be transparent have led researchers in HCI to sig - nal an urgent need to attend to the privacy , trust , and algorithmic transparency of these technologies [ 39 , 42 , 66 ] . And , scholars have shown that when users fnd a certain aspect or feature empower - ing , they choose to continue to use privacy - invasive technologies regardless of privacy risks [ 1 , 76 , 77 , 80 ] . This is heightened within intimate self - tracking technologies where women and gendered minorities often fnd themselves having to choose between losing the empowerment these technologies can ofer or risking surveil - lance and being subjected to the oppressive norms embedded into the technologies , such as stereotypes of gender , race and class [ 5 , 14 , 35 , 61 , 62 , 84 ] . In this paper , we present an analysis based on four workshops ( n = 14 ) with people who have used or are currently using the soft - ware application Natural Cycles in Birth Control mode . We used creative activities to support conversations with participants about their relationships with their digital contraception , and in particular what happens to this relationship during complex events . We con - tribute an analysis which illustrates the mixed feelings and shifting relations individuals experience toward their digital contraceptive in varying scales and temporalities . We untangle the uneasy , con - ficting , ambivalent and often risky afective dimensions that arise when using this kind of novel technology . We highlight these as the unavoidable troubles and disruptions inherent to intimate long - term human - human [ 11 ] and human - technology relationships [ 10 ] . Rather than seeking to cover up such mixed feelings , we show how design might work with ambivalence to provide opportunities for more sustainable intimate relationships with technology over the long term . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Intimate Self - Tracking in HCI The feld of HCI and Interaction Design has in recent years pro - duced a number of studies in the area of intimate self - tracking , specifcally in contexts where the technology is close to the body or to intimate bodily processes . Within this area , there has been a clear focus on menstrual tracking technologies and fertility track - ing technologies . Epstein et al . [ 28 ] showed how people in the USA used menstrual tracking apps ( and other tools ) for preparing for menstruation and for supporting conversations with healthcare staf . More recently , Fox et al . [ 36 ] ’s historical analysis and partici - patory experiments highlighted that most menstrual trackers frame menstruating bodies as something to be managed , and proposed to reimagine them instead from a sense - making perspective that recognizes the individuality of bodies . In line with these fndings , Tuli et al . [ 83 ] ’s study of people’s experiences with these technolo - gies in India concluded that they indeed reinforced the expectation of controlling one’s body to preserve its ’dignity’ , by , for example , promising the avoidance of leaking through clothes . Intimate self - tracking technologies can provide valuable ‘knowl - edge about the self’ [ 3 ] , which has been shown to be key in digital approaches to conception work through fertility tracking . For exam - ple , Grenfell et al . [ 41 ] interviewed Natural Cycles users in the UK who were using it in planning mode , and showed that the knowl - edge that users developed about their own bodies helped in their conception work . Another interview study of Natural Cycles in planning mode [ 37 ] highlighted the app’s potential in also sup - porting pre - conception work , which participants were sometimes lacking from healthcare services . Nevertheless , this self - knowledge can also increase the burden of the person trying to become preg - nant , as reported by Costa Figueiredo and Chen [ 19 ] when studying people’s experiences with fertility tracking technologies in the USA . Moreover , several studies have also found that the management of the couple’s fertility - related decisions often fell on women , adding to the critiques around gendered roles in intimate self - tracking ( e . g . , [ 28 , 29 , 43 , 48 , 49 , 56 ] ) . Hamper [ 43 ] critically examined the discrepancy between the advertised narratives of fertility tracking apps with a sharing feature and women’s lived experiences of using them by showing disruptions in redistributing the feminized labor due to prioritization of men’s sexual desire and male partners’ aspi - ration for natural spontaneous conception . Meanwhile , Homewood et al . [ 48 ] attempted to reconfgure this gendered pre - conception labor as a shared and relational experience through the design of a domestic sensual object , Ovum . In this paper , we focus on designing specifcally for digital contra - ception , a topic that has received , to our knowledge , little attention in the HCI literature [ 16 , 75 ] . An unpublished interview study with Swedish users of Natural Cycles in birth control mode can be found in a master thesis from 2017 [ 16 ] . Chen’s fndings ( similar to later studies about conception [ 37 , 41 ] ) highlighted the app’s role in scafolding self - knowledge . Perhaps more importantly , this study reported the avoidance of hormonal birth control methods as the participants’ main motivation to use Natural Cycles , which is in line with Le Guen et al’s [ 53 ] report on people increasingly reject - ing hormone - based methods due to factors , such as negative side efects , preference for methods deemed ’natural’ , or for methods that aford ’control’ of one’s body . Given this background , designers of intimate self - tracking tech - nologies must strive to recognize the diferent users , uses , and experiences of these products , despite their seemingly similar tech - nical functions , such as the identifcation of the fertile window and the prediction of menstruation . This is not to say that there is not at times a blurring of uses [ 28 , 83 ] . However , on the whole , the experi - ence of using a tool for predicting bleeding , versus getting pregnant , versus avoiding pregnancy , will in many cases have diferent ebbs and fows , frustrations and wins , and subsequently , diferent re - quirements for design . With this in consideration , we turn towards the afective dimensions within self - tracking practices to compre - hend these complex afects and drifting relationships of varying scales and temporalities in the digital contraception experience as a feld of inquiry . 417 Ambivalences in Digital Contraception : Designing for Mixed Feelings and Oscillating Relations DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA 2 . 2 Afective Dimensions within the Self - Tracking Practice Self - tracking technologies have become increasingly intertwined with private spaces and confdential information , blurring the no - tion of discrete individual autonomous agency [ 74 , 78 ] . Within social sciences , Savolainen et al . [ 74 ] underscored the signifcance of accounting for intimate and afective horizons of autonomy in human - algorithm relation alongside the instrumental and func - tional horizons . The authors predicated their stance on a growing propensity of ‘algorithmic intimacies’ , that technologies corrode our sense of epistemic authority and human actors develop vulnera - ble emotional attachment to the personalized algorithms . Similarly , Lupton et al . [ 60 ] urged the necessity to study sensory and emo - tional aspects of self - tracking technologies , referring to embodied - technological sense making process of self - tracking and data cre - ation , proposing to use the term ‘data sense’ instead of ‘data literacy’ . Acknowledging the afective dimensions of self - tracking technol - ogy could aford us to zoom into the dynamics of self - tracking as lived experience and the relational engagement of multiple human and non - human actors . Numerous interdisciplinary works have covered positive and negative afective dimensions of self - tracking technologies [ 54 – 56 , 58 , 59 , 65 , 78 , 85 ] . According to Wieczorek et al . ’s literature review on self - tracking technology , positive accounts of these technologies have been extensively indicated , albeit some of them remaining quite promissory [ 85 ] . The positive afects comprised of sense of empowerment , pleasure [ 59 ] , reassurance [ 54 , 65 ] , and solidarity [ 78 ] accompanied with increased self - knowledge [ 59 ] , improved well - being or productivity , and a sense of control or better decision making [ 28 , 58 , 59 , 85 ] . On the other hand , several studies have reported accounts of afective discomfort of self - tracking practices using digital tech - nology . Negative afect derived from a wide variety of relational settings , ranging from the direct interaction with the technology , perceived selfhood , between other users , one’s family members , or intimate partners to social norm - inficting situations . For exam - ple , people felt a sense of irritation or annoyance at fnding the technology ‘nagging’ [ 60 ] for diligent data input . The obligation of diligent data collection at times led to tracking fatigue afording people to get overwhelmed by a vast amount of self data [ 17 , 30 , 59 ] . Meanwhile , failure to do so led to moral self - judgement of guilt in the context of chronic illness management [ 6 ] . Disappointment and frustration were spotted during sense - making processes when the data did not meet the instrumental purpose [ 32 , 59 ] or the collected data turned out to be indecipherable . As for the recommendations of the technology , people felt anxiety or stigma if they failed to complete what the technology suggested [ 65 , 69 ] . Notably , people did not always agree with the algorithmic recommendation , feeling uneasy about the discrepancy between what the self - tracked data said about their bodies and their own bodily perceptions [ 60 ] . In social and privacy settings , Dennison et al . and Ploderer et al . re - ported participants’ mixed sentiment of dread and pride of sharing their ftness and smoking cessation data [ 26 , 67 ] . This goes in line with Will et al . ’s fndings on emotional friction between intimate partners [ 86 ] . Last but not least , self - tracking technologies could induce depression or feelings of insufciency by continuously pro - jecting social norms of healthy or sexually reproductive citizens on users [ 6 , 56 ] . While , several works in HCI and design have engaged with the negative afects of self - tracking technologies they have mostly fo - cused on the aspect of eliminating these afects to improve the experience of self - tracking , with the exception of [ 67 ] , which val - orized conficting emotional tensions as a designerly value . For example , Ayobi et al . attended to lived difculties of multiple scle - rosis patients and proposed design directions that support a sense of control and foster mindful self - tracking [ 7 ] . Choe et al . [ 17 ] suggested design implications of mitigating user burdens of self - quantifcation and Hue et al . argued for technological support of co - interpretation and collaborative sensemaking to resolve inter - personal conficts [ 50 ] . Relatedly , Alqahtani et al . and Schneider et al . proclaimed the importance of designing with uncertainty to better create nuanced and refexive self - tracking technology [ 4 , 75 ] . Particularly , Schneider et al . discussed design directions of con - veying algorithmic uncertainty while maintaining a low level of negative afects in the context of fertility tracking technology [ 75 ] . This paper contributes to this literature by paying close analytical attention to the afective dimensions experienced in the use of digi - tal contraception . We highlight ambivalence as a core element of user experience to be designed for and with in long - term intimate relations with technology . 3 METHOD We conducted online design workshops to intermingle afective accounts of users with diverse backgrounds , geographical locations , and experiences of digital contraception , and ground our research on users’ lived experiences . To avoid centering the instrumental dimensions of the technology , we used imaginative and creative activities to help us explore the complex experiences that partici - pants might have with Natural Cycles . We wanted in particular to discuss afective and shifting relations ascribed in Natural Cycles without directly prompting participants to talk about afect . Our study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Author - ity ( Etikprövningsmyndigheten ) for Research . Our research is not funded by Natural Cycles . The company provided help with partic - ipant recruitment by distributing our call . We did not receive any type of data from Natural Cycles . In the following sections , we frst provide the necessary background about this digital contraceptive ; we then detail the recruitment , the workshop design , and the data collection and analysis . 3 . 1 Natural Cycles Natural Cycles is a software application for users to prevent , plan or follow pregnancy . It is the frst software application to get certifed by the European Union and cleared by the Food and Drug Admin - istration ( FDA ) in the United States to market itself as a medical device for contraception . This subscription - based service provides individualised predictions and fertility information based on user - collected temperature data ( either body basal temperature —BBT— taken via a basal thermometer , or distal skin temperature via an 418 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Park , et al . Table 1 : Details of our workshop participants . We conducted 4 online workshops throughout 2 month period and in total we had 14 participants . All of them were currently using Natural Cycles . We did not collect demographic information of the participants since we found it not crucial .

Additionally , users can input the result of urine - based test strips ( Lutenizing Hormone , LH test ) which is taken into account in the ovulation and period predictions . Users may also log other experiences such as pain , mood swings , or cervical mucus consistency , which are not taken into account to predict ovulation or bleeding . Natural Cycles users have access to and can switch between NC° Birth Control , NC° Plan Pregnancy , and NC° Follow Pregnancy modes within the app based on their primary goal [ 23 ] . When used in NC° Birth Control mode , the app displays what it believes to be non - fertile days as ‘Green Days’ and fertile days as ‘Red Days’ . Recently , Natural Cycles introduced Part - ner View , which allows a user to share their intimate data with a partner on the partner’s own device . When this feature is activated , the green / red day history , ovulation status , menstruation entries , logged temperatures ( and reason for exclusion ) , and predictions are shared by default , and the main user decides what secondary data to share in addition , and for what time range [ 22 ] . 3 . 2 Recruitment We recruited people who were 18 + years old and were using or had used Natural Cycles in Birth Control Mode . The recruitment advert explicitly encouraged participation from the LGBTQIA + commu - nity , following the calls for research enacting non - essentialized notions of embodiment and reproductive health [ 2 , 51 , 70 ] . The recruitment was carried out in three outlets . First , we contacted a pool of participants from a larger study that we are conducting with users of this digital contraceptive . These participants had already expressed a desire to be contacted in relation to participating in 1 Oura Ring ( https : / / ouraring . com / ) is a separate wearable product that is compat - ible with Natural Cycles . Users can sync the ring with the app , and have the ring automatically measure temperature overnight . our design workshops . Additionally , the frst author shared the workshop advert on online Facebook communities of Natural Cy - cles’ users . The advert was also distributed by the company in their monthly newsletter . We ofered 3 - 6 seats per workshop . Morning , afternoon and evening time slots intended to serve diverse time zones . We sent participants an information sheet and a consent form a few days before their session . 3 . 2 . 1 Participants . In total 38 people signed up , 14 of which at - tended the workshops across 4 sessions ( See Table 1 ) . Each work - shop was conducted with diferent participants . Since participants met each other for the frst time , we did not ask for demographic information , such as age , gender , sexual orientation , or ethnicity . This was to create a safe , comfortable atmosphere and further pro - tect their privacy . Thirteen participants resided in Europe , and one participant joined from the United States . Without being asked , participants mentioned their relationship status , which included single ( 2 ) , married ( 1 ) , and monogamous and non - monogamous relationships ( 5 ) — statuses of the remaining participants are un - known . All participants were using or had used the product for contraceptive purposes , and two participants also had used it to plan a pregnancy . Five participants expressed additional purposes beyond contraception , such as gaining knowledge about their cycle , and their bodies , and tracking health conditions . Their time of use of the digital contraceptive ranged from several months to 7 years . Four participants used the digital contraceptive in combination with the Oura Ring . All names have been pseudonymized . While we aimed at recruiting participants worldwide , and four participants were not European , the majority resided in this region at the moment of running the study . This means that our fndings are likely to be dominated by European contexts and perspectives . 419 Ambivalences in Digital Contraception : Designing for Mixed Feelings and Oscillating Relations DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA 3 . 3 Workshop Design We designed the workshops to last around 1 . 5 hours . The frst two were run with four participants each , and the last two with three . We used the video - conferencing platform Zoom and the online collaboration platform Miro to foster a space for creative activities and discussions . Each session was facilitated by the frst author and one other co - author . The workshops were carried out in English , and the participants could choose to join with or without a video feed . Each workshop was designed around two activities to uncover ( 1 ) users’ intimate personal relationship with the digital contraceptive , ( 2 ) the development of their afective experience of digital contra - ception within diferent relationships , contexts , and temporalities , and ( 3 ) ideas for design interventions . The frst 10 minutes were spent to brief participants about the activities and the schedule , answer questions on the information sheet , and obtain informed consent . The facilitator then shared rules for participation which emphasised that we would not tol - erate hate speech , and that participants should share only if they felt comfortable doing so . Before starting with the activities each participant , including the facilitators , introduced themselves by name , what they did for a job , and how long they had used the digital contraceptive to create a fun and relaxed environment . The frst activity ( 20 minutes ) used the metaphor of technology - as - creature to probe participants to think about their personal , intimate relationship with the digital contraceptive . We prepared an online canvas for each participant where they could draw out an embodied version of their digital contraceptive , imagining it was a creature , and write a letter to it , recalling their past and present and speculating about their future . Since we expected that not every participant was going to be comfortable with producing a digital drawing on Miro , we told participants that they could either utilize pre - existing digital images that represent their creatures or share their drawings on a physical paper and have facilitators screenshot them . Participants worked individually and then shared with the group . Inspired by [ 15 , 82 ] , who demonstrated the potential of a ‘monster’ metaphor as a generative instrument , we used it to probe participants’ afective and relational associations with the technology as a non - human actor in longitudinal temporal frames . Figure 1 : Example Scenario : One of the six scenarios used in our workshop during the second activity . However , instead of ‘monster’ , we used the term ‘creature’ so as not to bias the participants towards negative connotations . While acknowledging this metaphorical framing might amplify certain afective aspects , we felt that the benefts outweighed this risk , as the method showed potential to open up a layperson - friendly space to unravel intimate human - machine entanglements [ 31 ] . The second activity was designed around semi - fctional use sce - narios to evoke critical discussions without requiring participants to share their personal experiences , as we recognize the burden and vulnerability of disclosing personal narratives [ 45 ] . All six scenar - ios were carefully crafted by the frst author , using as inspiration , preliminary fndings from a larger interview study that we are con - ducting with users of the digital contraceptive . The scenarios ( see Fig . 1 ) represented a diversity of genders , types of relationships , sexual orientations , ideas on childbirth , menstrual regularity , and lifestyles as a way of incorporating intersectional [ 21 ] perspectives on bodies into the discussion . The frst component ( 20 minutes ) aimed at contextualizing changing afects and relations between users , bodies , the digital contraceptive , and partners and its varying temporalities . As a group , participants chose one scenario to collec - tively discuss . The second component of the activity ( 15 minutes ) was based on particular moments of the scenario that trouble the level of trust that a fctional user poses in the digital contraceptive , inquiring into how participants thought the digital contraceptive could intervene and when and how they speculated that the level of trust would further evolve . 3 . 4 Data Collection and Analysis We recorded each workshop session and deleted the video fles , keeping only the audio fles . The collected data includes audio tran - scripts of each session , participants’ drawings , textual data from the letters , and post - it notes made by participants and the facilitator on the Miro board . The audio data was transcribed using the uni - versity’s GDPR - compliant automated transcription service , which was then checked for errors by the frst author . We analyzed the data using thematic analysis [ 12 , 13 ] . This analysis was refexive , where our epistemological commitment to intersectional feminist theory [ 21 ] explicitly infuenced the analysis . While attempting to truthfully represent and summarize the data , our subjective posi - tionalities led us to highlight moments of friction and discomfort in the data . The research team comprised individuals with diferent cultural backgrounds and familiarity with varying contraceptive practices ( two authors having the experience of using Natural Cy - cles ) which enabled critical data analysis incorporating diverse viewpoints . The frst author inductively coded the data . Then , the research team gathered in two collaborative data analysis sessions to conceptualize the themes based on the coded data while looking at it in context , i . e . , including participants’ drawings , letters , and post - its as they were laid out on the Miro boards . 4 DIMENSIONS OF AMBIVALENCE IN DIGITAL CONTRACEPTIVE EXPERIENCE The workshops unearthed complex and shifting afects and rela - tions that cannot be reduced to pure empowerment or resignation . Instead , the participants’ engagement with Natural Cycles , their somatic bodies and intimate partner / s implied diferent scales and 420 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Park , et al . temporalities of ambivalence . Our analysis supports Ruckenstein and Schüll’s take on ambivalence as a volatile range of afective ori - entations that people have toward the tracking of self - data - from hope to disappointment , pleasure to frustration , control to obsessiveness [ 73 ] . In this section , we introduce four dimensions of ambivalence that emerge in varying relational confgurations , namely : diligence and disobedience , care and control , shared responsibility and my sovereignty , and life - long reliance and emancipation . Drawing from the creative materials generated by the participants and collec - tive discussion over four scenarios ( which most often expanded to their actual experiences ) , we contextualize and illuminate each facet of mixed feelings and oscillating relations in digital contracep - tive experience . We use a participant’s pseudonym in parentheses alongside any direct quotes . 4 . 1 Defying the Deity : Diligence and Disobedience Figure 2 : The goddess - like drawings or a digital image par - ticipants created or brought in during the technology - as - creature activity . From left to right , Red Goddess Who Whis - per by Parker , Oxum by Blair ( which is a goddess fture in Yoruba - based religion as Blair explained ) , and Inanna by Jas - mine ( surrounded by myriads of 1’s and 0’s representing data streams as Jasmine explained . ) We found that there was a sense of loyalty and dedication that coexisted with awe and boundedness . Some participants illustrated this complex afect by drawing fgures of a deity ( See Fig . 2 ) . Many associated the app with a feminine goddess ( Parker , Blair , and Jas - mine ) passing on and executing the bodily knowledge - noting that ideally this could have passed on through maternal kin - mani - fested as a spiritual being with omnipotent knowledge and with disciplining power . On one hand , the participants felt empowered from the deity ‘whispering ( Parker ) ’ intimate guidance which moti - vated them to willingly pursue the diligent work of logging in their temperature every morning and sacrifcing snooze . On the other hand , deviating from the app’s advice was understood to produce unknown consequences which generated a sense of implicit obliga - tion to follow the app’s predictions . As Parker described , “you can listen to it or not , but it’s better if you listen ( Parker ) . " Multiple participants expressed fear and unease towards the app’s epistemic authority over themselves . For example , Jasmine ( see Fig . 3 ) , while recognizing the technology mediated ’reconnection ( Jasmine ) ’ to her body , voiced wariness about her technological deity having too much power that can be easily transformed into a “tool of oppression and control if it gets in the wrong hands” ( Jasmine ) . Blair ( see Fig . 3 ) shared her concern about the company’s treatment of users’ personal data . Still , she implied an intent to continue using the app , saying , “But I do fear a bit [ that ] the data . . . all the data consent that we do give Natural Cycles because I still don’t know what they do with it . I still have concerns , but I do trust in science , and I hope the company is doing the right thing " ( Blair ) . These feelings exposed participants’ ambivalence in using a technology that they both feared and trusted while fulflling their instrumental purpose of making the contraception practice tractable . The users showing active faith in ’the science’ ( Blair , Frida , Kiara ) and readily detaching it from corporate interests distinguish this afect from resignation or helplessness . Rather , it demonstrates how people balance diferent trade - ofs when using intimate care technologies and how immediate benefts persuade them to use the technology with possible privacy concerns . The app enforced a certain lifestyle onto its users , a routinized and clean living of waking up approximately at similar times every day and measuring their temperature . This nested as a ritual for some , like Jamie who confessed to have started to enjoy such a lifestyle , writing in her letter ’And you know what , now I actually enjoy waking up without the 30 min snooze’ ( Jamie ) . Meanwhile , some people’s ritual were another’s prison : some habituated them - selves to no more snoozing , while others sought escape from this routinized practice by bringing in the Oura Ring which automat - ically measured and sent the basal body temperature data to the app . Notably , Morgan and Jordan expressed a sense of relief and care - freeness delegating the job to this technology . This provides an interesting perspective on the practice of ofoading the labor and guilt to another , even more data - hungry , technology , justifying even more creepiness . Blair explained her reason of not using the ring wearable mentioning its intrusiveness , it being “a bit too much into the data” ( Blair ) without knowing how much increased accu - racy it would endow . Some participants expanded their discussion refecting how a disciplined lifestyle is reinforced by the society where adverse circumstances of life get easily disregarded . Along with this , they voiced how disorderly bodies are not cared for by digital contraception . Jasmine remarked : Figure 3 : Full texts of letters participants created during the frst activity . The left one is a letter written by Jasmine to Inanna and the right one from Blair to Oxum ( respectively Jasmine and Blair’s Natural Cycles creatures ) 421 Ambivalences in Digital Contraception : Designing for Mixed Feelings and Oscillating Relations DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA “Apart from a technological solution like that [ Oura Ring ] , it’s hard to see what can really be changed or what kind of intervention the app could do . Because I have noticed it’s kind of a lifestyle thing . For Natural Cycles to work well , you need to have a degree of routine and stability . And as we’ve seen all of us in the last few years , that’s quite often out of our control . And yeah , illness , mental health , lifestyle , all play a role for it [ app ] to be really efective . So it’s a lot to ask of some people . And for a lot of people , say if you’re a shift worker , it’s not at all in your control” ( Jasmine ) . The majority of the participants reported and speculated contin - uous shift between obeying and transgressing what the app said . Yet , their disobedience happened in a willful manner , making sense by drawing upon their bodily intuition and knowledge cultivated while using the app . For instance , when discussing the scenarios of their bodily symptoms not matching the app’s predictions , Kiara and Jasmine responded that she " would not be prone to put deci - sions outside her body " ( Kiara ) nor “listen to the AI more than one’s own intuition or what one knows to be true of one’s cycle and body” ( Jasmine ) . These quotes capture the conficting perspectives of par - ticipants following tech - leveraged bodily self - knowledge , which they had formulated through using the app , over algorithmic pre - dictions . Especially the second workshop group projected that they would grow confdent in their bodily intuition as they perceive that they had been diligent and devoted enough during their past app use . Sometimes , appropriating complementary technologies such as LH tests enabled a more confdent override of the app prognosis as Kiara described : “ . . And then I just , kind of , felt that I’m ovulating sooner in my cycle than I have in the past . So I started taking the [ LH ] tests much earlier in the cycle . And , lo and behold , I was ovulating much earlier in the cycle . And once I told Natural Cycles ( the app ) this , it started checking for my ovulation much earlier . And then , of course , I could trust it again because it changed behavior” ( Kiara ) . As Blair , Jasmine , and Parker’s accounts illustrated , participants expressed feeling of glorious empowerment coexisting with a sense of unease . Despite creepy and fearful feelings toward the data prac - tice and its prevalent nudges towards certain lifestyles , participants were still inclined to continue using the app due to its outweighing benefts on - even if they might occasionally deviate . 4 . 2 Who Cares for Whom ? : Care and Control As much as the app took care of participants’ contraception , the participants took care of the app . This reciprocal care was well depicted in creature drawings and letters created by Taylor , Jamie , Giselle , Adriana , and Frida ( see Fig . 5 ) . They associated the app with a cute yet peevish beast that ‘sometimes will not work the way [ they ] want’ ( Taylor ) or a cat - like companion animal ’screaming’ ( Jamie ) in the morning . Some participants viewed the app requiring consistent “feeding” as Taylor writes in her letter : “I will never forget to feed you with the daily temperature data . In return , I hope that you will make it easier for me to feed you” ( Taylor ) . ( see Fig 4 ) . Unmet promises to feed the app imbued the user with a sense of guilt as a delinquent caretaker of a loyal technology . Giselle unpacked this intimate feeling in her letter to Nurturing Annoying Beast ( see Fig 4 ) : “thank you for being there every day , despite the fact that I sometimes forget about you . I feel bad , because you are always there at the same place , never moving” ( Giselle ) . At times , participants unveiled their intimate relationships with the app when they enacted tough care towards each other and mixed feelings that arise . Adriana described how she felt the app was scolding her , saying “Sometimes you tell me of , but I guess it’s when I don’t do as you advise , so I have it coming . But hey , it’s not always that fun . Sometimes I get annoyed at you . When you keep your red dot even though I’ve read your little message . Or when I think I’ve recorded my data and it turns out I haven’t” ( Adriana ) . Conversely , Morgan shared an episode of correcting the technology referring to self - assessed status of one’s menstrual cycle : “I know based on where I should be at in my cycle , based on my LH test . I had one glass of gin the other night . And the Oura Ring picked up a jump in temperature . So the app tried to tell me that I had just ovulated . And I was like , ’I know that’s wrong . I am not hungover . I feel fne . ’ But I scratched it out , and then it went red ( day ) again . I was like , okay , fne , that’s fne” ( Morgan ) . Majority of participants equated having more control over their bodies with ‘more bodily knowledge’ and felt a sense of empower - ment . However , not everybody was fond of the app’s controlling care , fnding it somewhat intrusive and lopsided . For instance , Lu - ciana remarked on the stalking sensation of being followed and interrupted by saying , “I mean , sometimes , you [ the app ] overreact to things when you see your phone , and I’m like , ‘not now’” ( Luciana ) . While Jordan wanted the app to ’stay by [ her ] side as long as [ she ] needs it’ ( Jordan ) , she pointed to the asymmetry of mutual trust . Jor - dan referred to the feeling she has that the app doesn’t seem to fully trust her which she elaborated in the letter to her creature : “Our relationship is still struggling time to time . I would like to say that I trust you completely , but this relationship has two parties and it’s not enough if only one ( the user ) has full trust” ( Jordan ) . Interestingly , Kiara and Jasmine disclosed seemingly contradict - ing orientations towards freedom , viewing the app being in control as leading to greater freedom . For instance , Kiara wrote in her letter Figure 4 : Full texts of letters participants created during the frst activity . The left one is a letter written by Taylor to Nacy and the right one from Giselle to Nurturing Annoying Beast ( respectively Taylor and Giselle’s Natural Cycles creatures ) 422 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Park , et al . Figure 5 : Cat , sheep , beast , or fufy animal reminding drawings and digital images participants created or decorated during the technology - as - creature activity . From left to right , Nacy by Taylor , Wakey wakey by Jamie , Nurturing Annoying Beast by Giselle , Cree by Adriana , and Early by Frida to her creature Scientista how it structuring her cycle made her ‘to be in fow and in contact with [ herself ] ’ ( Kiara ) . She added , “She [ the app ] can be square and keeps me in check and allows me to be in fow and be disorganized or whatever because she organizes me , which is great” ( Kiara ) . Meanwhile , Jasmine noticed the empowering side of this control , juxtaposing it with the ideas that she was raised in living in a Western country , where “fertility is something that needs to be controlled or suppressed so that your sexuality can be free” ( Jasmine ) . For her , the controlling care of the app helped her ‘fnd a way to practice sovereignty of her fertility’ ( Jasmine ) , liberating so - far oppressed fertility of hers . The technology - as - creature metaphor unearthed participants’ double feelings towards the extent of app’s control and their role as a caretaker of a , at times , temperamental and capricious technol - ogy . Jordan and Luciana’s refection revealed conficting afects of desiring long - term togetherness with the app while being doubtful about their mutual trust . Lastly , Kiara and Jasmine’s refection hint us of a complex backdrop of user - app relationship - being under control in exchange for another sense of freedom . 4 . 3 Opening Up the Intimate Rift : Shared Responsibility and My Sovereignty Since the interaction with the app usually occurred frst thing in the morning at the bedside , ambivalent feelings and unexpected situa - tions emerged when the app - user relationship intersected with the user’s social relations , especially with their intimate partner / s . Frida recollected an awkward moment when their partner frst encoun - tered the technology in their letter : ‘You’ve created some awkward conversations with partners — “why is there this bird that chirps ev - ery morning that follows you around ? Is that bird safe ? How do I know ? ”’ ( Frida ) . Those that had been with their intimate partner / s for a long time recounted daily tensions arising between having to unintentionally wake their partner up with the thermometer’s beeping sound and their urge to sleep in for a little longer . Jamie unpacked this situation in her letter : ‘Weekend mornings have never been the same since I got to know you . You have solved my constant need of hitting the snooze button - and annoyed my partner for sure’ ( Jamie ) . On the other hand , the app acted as a catalyst sparking of ini - tially uncomfortable yet inevitable conversations on the topic of contraception with their partner / s . For instance , Frida thought the app and the practice of morning temperature measuring “helped [ them ] connect better with [ their ] partners beyond just a standard conversation about birth control " ( Frida ) . They compared this expe - rience with their previous methods of birth control , saying : “I’ve had to talk about birth control much more than I did when I was on the pill or whatever , which is like you can just say ‘oh , I’m on the pill , it’s fne’ . And then there’s no further questions . So it’s a little awkward , and I’ve really had to lean into having those conversations with people . But ultimately , it’s been kind of fun to be like ‘yeah , this is why there’s this little bird [ the app ] that follows me around , isn’t that cool ? ’ And partners have been actually really interested in my birth control of choice , which has been diferent from anything that I’ve experienced when I was on more medical birth control pills and IUDs and whatever " ( Frida ) . At times , app - partner relationship unwittingly reshaped user - partner relationships , partner / s’ inaction and indiference causing participants’ disappointment or resignation . For instance , Taylor pointed out that it is still her work to initiate the long - term intimate partner’s engagement , which elicited self - doubt “if it’s too much of [ her ] to expect him to get involved with this process by himself " ( Taylor ) : “I think I expected it that he will be more proactive . Because usually birth control is kind of like a female thing , so you are the one who has to take care of taking the pill or whatever . And I thought by giving him the app and he can see if today is like a green day or red day , he will be also more involved in the process or maybe will proactively say , ‘oh , today we maybe cannot have unprotected sex because it’s a red day . ’ But in reality , nothing changed much . So I still have to encourage him to take a look " ( Taylor ) . Jordan interposed that the app’s design conceals “if the partner is actually looking at the data ever” ( Jordan ) which contributed to this sense of resignation . Users’ expectation towards partner / s’ engagement varied de - pending on their relationships . For instance , for the participant who was involved in a multiple partner relationships , the instru - mental aspect of the app with minimum amount of data sharing — red / green days — was more crucial than creating a collective responsibility . She found it awkward to share general fertility data and felt reluctant about the app meticulously displaying her bodily data to her partners . 423 Ambivalences in Digital Contraception : Designing for Mixed Feelings and Oscillating Relations DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA As a whole , a majority of participants appreciated the role of tech - nology in redistributing the contraceptive responsibilities which had been so far imposed on women and bodies that menstruate . However , their afect towards intimate data sharing , the extent to which they want to share , and willingness to involve their intimate partner / s fuctuated in time . Notably , Avery shared her journey of giving , ungiving , and again willing to regive the data access to her long - term intimate partner : “So I shared ( my data ) with him , and I found it lovely . The challenge for him and I is to navigate the fact that I want to prevent pregnancy , and if he could choose , he would have a baby . But for lots of reasons , it’s not actu - ally safe for me to have a baby . So in the end I said to him , I want to remove you from ( the app ) . It did really help to bring us closer , and it really helped to share that burden , and it helped us share that kind of understand - ing . But we’re in quite a unique situation because we’ve got diferent kinds of love committed to each other . ( . . . ) So for us , in the end , I said to him , I want you to come of because actually , it felt a little bit intrusive because it would create a tightness around the sexual experience . And actually for me , it was then about reclaiming my own body and saying , you know , I make the decision about whether we use protection or we don’t . But I’m at a point now where we continue to navigate these waves of challenge with the two , you know , bits and opinions . I thought actually I’ve quite liked to share it with him again . And so for me , I do really encourage the couple or any couple to use it together because it really does it really helps the dialogue " ( Avery ) . Avery’s story encapsulates the complexity of afect intertwined with interpersonal relationships and how the decision to ( un ) share one’s intimate data predicates on whether the user views the work of contraception and fertility tracking as a shared burden or as one’s bodily sovereignty ( my body , my choice ) . 4 . 4 ‘Us’ Towards a Farewell : Life - long Reliance and Emancipation Over varying timescales ( from a few months to several years ) par - ticipants have developed an intimate reliance on the app as a con - traceptive technology . Their journeys were not always promising . As Luciana remarked in her letter : " We have been together for such a long time , and we have been through everything " ( Luciana ) . Their relationship with the app took time to ripen , going through many ups and downs . Giselle described that she built mutual respect with the app after gladly having ‘all the battles’ ( Giselle ) . Adriana gave a similar account of resolved conficts noting that ‘ [ the app has ] given [ her ] a fright , but not one [ they ] haven’t been able to get past’ ( Adriana ) . Avery delineated her journey as initially feeling immensely vulnerable and through completing her side of diligent work , gradually learning how to trust the app . She described : “It’s taken time to trust it . It really has , because it felt like I was exposing myself to a massive , massive risk . And it’s been unbelievable , actually . But I do the temperature every single morning . I do my LH tests , you know , in the build - up . And it is so accurate” ( Avery ) . Some had developed such trust in the app that they perceived ret - rospective corrections to the algorithms predictions — for example of a user’s ovulation day — not as a failure , but as a moment through which to trust the app again . For example , Adriana remarked : I mean , it can change past dates , green or red . It has done that for me . ( . . . ) It would change Green Day to Red day and say , “it looks like this , there might have been an ovulation here 2 . It’s a little bit shit because then you’re like , " oh , well , it’s good that you tell me now . Too late ! " . But then I feel like the trust in the algorithm and the app is regained . But you’re still a bit pissed of at how it turned out” ( Adriana ) Over time , participants increasingly found the app’s prediction complementary , enabling more confdence in their own bodily knowledge and awareness which had now been fortifed through us - ing the app . For example , Kiara showed lenient generosity towards the app , saying , “If I were Charlie [ the main character of Scenario 4 ] , I would go ’thank you very much for giving me a Green Day , but I’m going to pass on that . I’m going to call today Red Day’ . The body can do so much . The body is so fuid . Thus it’s understandable if an algorithm can’t quite keep up with everything that’s happening in human body . So I would go , ‘Well done , you . But I know best’ " ( Kiara ) . Positing their historic relationship with the app , some envisioned their collective future , with the technology as a life - long companion “staying by their side as long as they need [ it ] ” ( Jordan ) . For instance , Avery expressed her hope for cross - generational future , noting in her letter as , ‘I am so excited to introduce you to my daughter when she starts to menstruate . ’ ( Avery ) Relatedly , Morgan speculated the app to always be there through her peri - menopausal period , writing ‘I feel like we will be together for quite some time - I am very intrigued to see what happens to my body as I age , especially as I go through menopause’ ( Morgan ) . When imagining the future of this binding technological rela - tionship , participants voiced ambivalent and double feelings arising from many layers of existential uncertainty : such as not knowing until when the app would remain available , the repercussions of their personal data being owned by a private company , and until when they could or are willing to pay the subscription fee . Jas - mine expressed this claustrophobic and overwhelming sentiment resulting from the idea that her contraception practice and fertility tracking can be fnancially bound and heavily dependent on the app for the next several decades . She wrote , ‘I would like for our relationship to continue though I do sometimes feel ambivalent about the fnancial commitment it will require for the rest of my fertile days . Perhaps it is the sacrifce that is required to continue living in sync with my natural rhythms and having some hand in navigating my health and fertility in the least invasive way’ ( Jasmine ) . The cyclical expiration of the Natural Cycles membership trig - gered uneasy self - refections and decisions around ‘do I still need it ? ’ Frida said they are ‘at the crossroad’ ( Frida ) of deciding whether such a long commitment was worth it or whether they had gained 2 During the workshop some participants described the app as changing a Green / Red Day retrospectively . However , according to our private correspondence with Natural Cycles , the app never corrects past fertility statuses ( Green / Red Day ) , but can retro - spectively adjust the ovulation day , and notify a user of an incorrectly predicted ’green day’ . 424 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Park , et al . enough knowledge that they could emancipate themselves . They elaborated : “And at this point , the algorithm kind of feels like back up to me of confrming the things that I know . ( . . . ) I view [ the app ] as a confrmation rather than ( as ) my leader in my birth control . So I’m going to use it for the next few months until my subscription renews to decide ‘do I still want that confrmation or do I really feel like good going out on my own ? ’” ( Frida ) . We witnessed that building trust with a digital contraceptive is a slow process encompassing occasions of confusion , reconcilia - tion , and negotiation , as shown in Adriana and Avery’s stories and Giselle and Luciana’s refections . Along with optimistic imagina - tions of life - long co - reliance with the technology ( Avery , Morgan ) , some participants anticipated oscillation in their relationships . Like the cases of Jasmine and Frida who periodically reassessed their technological dependence and bodily data sensing [ 60 ] , leaving a door open for an end of this relationship . 5 DESIGNING FOR MIXED FEELINGS AND OSCILLATING RELATIONS While we note the importance of surveillance [ 57 ] and biopolitics [ 33 ] oriented structural critiques of algorithmic self - tracking tech - nology , we centered our attention on the afective and relational aspects of living with the technology that touches upon intimate horizons of contraception . Through a series of design workshops , we probed participants’ previous , current , and prospective experi - ences of living with digital contraceptive and associated imageries these technologies convey . Our fndings illustrate the complex senti - ments and shifting intimate entanglements between human actors , their bodies , and digital contraceptive technology . These highlight the unavoidable troubles , disruptions , and distractions that are in - herent to intimate long - term human - human relationships [ 11 ] and that seem to also be present or constitutive of our intimate relation - ships with technology . Thus , much like ‘caring’ is understood as a multifaceted , not only ontologically but politically ambivalent ( p . 7 ) concept generating mixed feelings and mixed approaches [ 47 , 68 ] , our empirical work highlights the mixed feelings and constantly shifting relations associated with intimate self - tracking technolo - gies . Extending previous works of designing with ambivalence [ 38 , 49 , 67 , 87 ] , we propose its analytical value of afording situated discern - ment of everyday realities of intimate self - tracking experiences [ 73 ] and generative merit for designing long - term digital contraceptive technologies . In what follows , we present three design strategies of digital contraceptive technologies and demonstrate how embracing and leveraging ambivalences facilitate designers to acknowledge users as embodied and afective beings rather than rational con - sumers or oblivious victims [ 77 , 79 ] . 5 . 1 Why Design with Ambivalence in Mind ? Within our analysis we have identifed ambivalence as a core ex - periential quality associated with the use of intimate self - tracking technologies , which manifest in contradictory feelings , conficting behaviors , and frequent changes in human and non - human actors’ relations . We see ambivalence as a compound of disruptions , trou - bles and distractions inherent in intimate spheres of human life [ 11 ] and long - term human technology relationships . The question that we are drawn to is the extent to which this ambivalence im - pacts on user experience , and whether a designer should attend to these experiences of ambivalence in the design and development of interactive systems . A closely related concept within user ex - perience research could be that of ‘seams’ [ 27 ] . In Drozd et al . ’s work [ 27 ] , seams are technological in nature and arise when the state of the system intended to be seen by a user is in fact difer - ent to the state of the system in reality . To respond to such seams researchers have previously proposed that these seams might be removed , hidden , managed , revealed or exploited [ 9 ] . Our inter - pretation of ambivalence is likely inherent to any long - term use of intimate self - tracking technologies through which the idea of a body as a sociotechnical assemblage will be constantly shaped and reshaped . [ 36 ] In other words , a response to these ambivalences is not with the intent to eliminate or solve , but to instead recog - nize that these experiences are inherent in what it means to have intimacy within another . From a user experience perspective , we may wish instead to reveal or leverage these in order to provide compelling , more sustainable , and ethical user experiences . Ambivalence as a conceptual approach to design has been ex - amined previously by Yurman [ 87 ] in her speculative and critical explorations of the mixed feelings and experiences that new moth - ers have towards their smartphone devices . In particular , her work highlights the ambivalent feelings that parents have towards screen - based devices ( a central touchpoint to social life ; versus the guilt of not attending to a child ; versus worry about the impact of screens on child development ) as a source of inspiration for design . We also see traces of this experience of mixed emotions in previous work related to intimate self - tracking technologies . For example , in Homewood et al . ’s [ 49 ] exploration of literal and hypothetical ex - periences of stopping the use of intimate self - tracking , the authors highlight the ambivalent feelings that participants had toward the technology – and in particular in the realisation that stopping using an app would not only cause a loss of a functional ability to be organised , but also a loss of a feeling of security associated with using an app . In what follows , we present three design strategies demonstrat - ing how ambivalent afects and relations can be generative for designing more sustainable intimate interactions and digital con - traceptive technologies . 5 . 2 Supporting Willful Collision Along with discussions on the creepy aspects of privacy - invasive technologies [ 77 , 80 ] , our analysis suggests that users also experi - ence a sense of ambivalence in relation to conficts ( actual or an - ticipated ) between themselves and the technology . At times , users fnd themselves closely matched in goals and use , and at other times at a distance with the use of the app , in confict with the outcomes that they are seeking , as Jasmine and Kiara’s accounts of willfully discounting the app’s prediction of a green day exemplify . We argue that these disruptions could be accentuated through de - sign by enabling opportunities for reinterpretation , refection , and reconfguration of their relations . Inspired by the imageries participants created of their digital con - traceptives as a living matriarchal wisdom , a deity that should be listened to , and at the same time , who may punish them when they 425 Ambivalences in Digital Contraception : Designing for Mixed Feelings and Oscillating Relations DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA choose not to , we fnd ourselves drawn to explore a feminist rein - terpretation ’scolding’ as an approach to these experiences . Many participants talked about their interactions with the app as being close to be ‘told of’ or the expectation that they could be treated based on the ways that they had behaved . Reconceptualizing this in - teraction into a mutual scolding - those resembling scolds between childhood friends , cohabitants , or mother and daughter - may be a design strategy to enable users to talk back to the technology or construct a breathing space for users to refect upon oneself and the recorded self [ 74 ] . Responding to Parker and Avery’s aspiration for a intimate health technology that fosters both interpersonal and self - dialogue , scolding gestures could serve as a device to provoke such dialogues . Users can revisit how they see themselves and their bodies and how this gets interpreted to develop mutual understand - ing – not as another device for behavioral change triggering feelings of shame and guilt . Being able to reciprocate scolding seems important to this strat - egy . Participants spoke of occasions where the digital contraceptive retrospectively adjusted its determination of ovulation , where they took actions to correct the predictions by using complementary tools like LH tests ( a practice that is recommended by Natural Cycles ) , or wanted to contextualize temperature data points ( e . g . , heightened body temperature due to alcohol rather than ovulation , yet not hungover ) . Despite the digital contraceptive’s signifcant responsibility it plays on the user’s life , there are very few oppor - tunities for the user to scold the app / algorithm when it ‘misun - derstands’ , lacking the dynamic and reciprocal interactions that we expect in intimate human - human relationships . By heightening ambivalent moments with opportunities for collisions , users may sensibly contribute to an app’s accuracy . And this , in turn , could enable a frm base for cultivating users’ “intro - sensing [ 64 ] ” , an inner sensitivity leveraged through datafed measurement , possibly contributing to the fourth dimension of ambivalence . 5 . 3 Appreciating ‘Good Enough’ Care The ambivalent experience central to this second design strategy stems from the claustrophobic experience of indefnitely caring for something which requires so much attention and work , while simultaneously knowing that what one provides will be always not good enough . In part , the disruption arises from the asymmetry in how this ‘obsession’ is experienced . It is well discussed in the liter - ature that self - tracking technologies exert control over how users behave in particular ways - disciplining oneself to maintain healthy , responsible [ 44 ] , and repetitive lifestyles [ 6 , 10 ] . Our participants’ discussions reafrmed this - that in order to be a good user and maintain algorithmic qualities , one must lead a lifestyle with ’ a degree of routine and stability ’ ( Jasmine ) . The constraints imposed by the digital contraception were received with mixed feelings , fuctuating with stages of life , relationships , work situations , health conditions , and motivations . Namely , a person may feel both a need to care for the app by feeding it with their data while also feeling a sense of guilt in their inability to attend to the app as required , or frustrated that this app demands so much care and attention . While , perhaps for other forms of self - tracking where tracking is accomplished only over a relatively short time frame [ 72 ] a user may decide to stop when faced with such feelings , the ambivalence experienced in this particular context of ‘anticipated long - term use’ signals that the use of intimate technology often persists despite this discomfort . Attending to notions of ‘good enough’ might be a useful strategy to design with this unavoidable ambivalence . There is a sense of needing to be freer , for the interactions with these technologies to have more fexibility and more willingness to accept the less rigid lives that people lead . This not only takes into account a multiplicity of lifestyles , but also those involuntarily needing fexibility due to the rigidity of personal situations such as shift work or child care . And while it may seem contradictory , participants considered that to free themselves from this rigidity , more precise notation and documentation was desired . Participants wanted to be able to tell the digital contraceptive more honestly why some data points were irregular or should be discounted but not necessarily excluded ( note the subtle diferences between ‘I drank some alcohol’ versus ‘being hungover’ ) . To a certain extent , they wanted to be able to add more situational nuances to the data collection activity such that their data may be still used to nourish the algorithm ( even if this data is not the ’healthy treat’ that the algorithm ‘craves’ ) . Meanwhile , re - balancing the level of ‘obsession’ between user and technology is another way of designing with conficting feel - ings and distractions . Although , perhaps , the application has this rather nuanced understanding of the user , this nuance is not recip - rocated . Participants found themselves noting patterns between their somatic experiences of their reproductive cycle - for example how experiences of stress , changes in sleep patterns and so on - infuenced when they ovulated , or when they menstruated , and wished that the algorithm and app would help them to notice or trust them to notice these experiences too . 5 . 4 Fostering Responsive Dialogues with Intermissions While it is often said that responsibility of contraception should be a shared endeavour among intimate partners , on the whole , this work has tended to be driven by women and those who risk becoming pregnant through intercourse [ 19 , 20 , 41 , 43 ] . A ’partner view’ of Natural Cycles works towards the potential sharing of this activity with digital contraceptive . While participants generally liked the idea of involving their partner / s to their contraception journey and sharing their intimate data , interpersonal ambivalence sat at the heart of it , confrming earlier work [ 43 ] . Participants interpreted partner / s’ involvement as a caring engagement to distribute the contraceptive burden , while other times viewed it as an unwelcome interference or surveillance leading to awkward discomfort . When the data sharing was perceived as care , the partner / s’ inaction pro - voked disappointment among the participants . Yet , Avery’s vignette reafrmed Will et al . ’s fndings [ 86 ] on how partner / s’ involvement may not necessarily be perceived as care , regardless of whether they share similar values and opinions over their bodily conditions . To work with these interpersonal ambivalent afects and dynamic relations , digital contraceptive technologies could accentuate and foster the responsive nature of sharing . Though initially awkward , participants were fond of the existence of technology ofering them an unwitting catalyst for a ‘contraception talk’ with their intimate partner / s . They found it challenging to maintain the reciprocity of 426 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Park , et al . this dialogue , though . In their study , Will et al . [ 86 ] foregrounded how surveillance and care are inherently intertwined in health tracking technology use in domestic settings . Acknowledging the impossibility of eliminating this tension , they see responsiveness as key to successful approaches . Our understanding of responsive - ness goes beyond a reciprocal response and towards a prolonged engagement of both partners in the contraceptive practice . Being re - sponsive might mean cultivating the ability to notice one another’s fuctuation of feelings and a fexibility of fne tuning diferent ways of caring . Responsive caring can manifest at times through sharing with each other ( e . g . , both partners tracking their fertility data to - gether ) , conveying trails of a partner’s past presence in collected data , or at other times , respecting the partner / s’ desire to move away from the topic . Such fexible orientations towards fertility and contraceptive data sharing might better support the ambivalent nature of ever - changing technology - mediated relations and be a useful strategy for intimate self - tracking technology as a whole . Meanwhile , it is important to consider that people’s willingness to share is not static . While sharing is signifcant in a sense , as it troubles the gendered labor of contraception [ 52 , 63 ] , participants’ stances toward sharing fuctuated even if they had been together for a long time , as in Avery’s case . New approaches could respect this relational ambivalence by supporting features of occasional intermissions from data sharing . In this way , we intend to move away from positivist views equating more data tracking / sharing to healthier relationships . Episodic ruptures and abandonment of technology should be viewed as a vital moment for users to navigate life changes [ 40 ] and a nurturing space disrupting the normalcy [ 49 ] of sharing to create refexive ground for healthier relationships with technology . We argue that positing ambivalences - complex sentiments and dynamically fuctuating interpersonal , human - technology , and human - body relations - may open up a design space for more inclusive dig - ital contraception technologies by envisioning diverse modes of life that goes beyond presumption of heteronormative and monogamic relationships [ 56 , 70 ] . Responding to [ 28 , 29 , 71 ] ’s critiques on fer - tility tracking and contraceptive technologies’ ambivalence as an analytical and generative lens could help designers expand their horizon towards the living and relational constellations that need more attention - such as , people with irregular menstrual cycles , chronic illness , or disabilities ; shift / night workers ; people in queer relationships or those who are ’single and mingling’ . 6 CONCLUSION Our close analysis of people’s experiences of using a digital contra - ception brought attention to the mixed feelings people develop in living with these intimate self - tracking technologies over the long term . Learning from the everyday experiences of Natural Cycles users based predominantly in Europe , we argue that ambivalence is somehow inherent to the nature of the relationships that we build with intimate self - tracking technologies . We suggest that rather than seeking to solve or alleviate conficting feelings and uncer - tain orientations of relationships , HCI researchers and designers can instead design with and for them to create opportunities for refection and reconfguration . In this light , we intend to open up a generative space of designing for mendable , renegotiable , and thus more resilient intimate ecologies of relations between human actors , their bodies , technology , and other human beings .
