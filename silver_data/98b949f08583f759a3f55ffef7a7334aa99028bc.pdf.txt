Cullen 1 , 5 SNX - BAR proteins are a sub - family of sorting nexins implicated in endosomal sorting . Here , we establish that through its phox homology ( PX ) and Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ( BAR ) domains , sorting nexin - 4 ( SNX4 ) is associated with tubular and vesicular elements of a compartment that overlaps with peripheral early endosomes and the juxtanuclear endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) . Suppression of SNX4 perturbs transport between these compartments and causes lysosomal degradation of the transferrin receptor ( TfnR ) . Through an interaction with KIBRA , a protein previously shown to bind dynein light chain 1 , we establish that SNX4 associates with the minus end - directed microtubule motor dynein . Although suppression of KIBRA and dynein perturbs early endosome - to - ERC transport , TfnR sorting is maintained . We propose that by driving membrane tubulation , SNX4 coordinates iterative , geometric - based sorting of the TfnR with the long - range transport of carriers from early endosomes to the ERC . Finally , these data suggest that by associating with molecular motors , SNX - BAR proteins may coordinate sorting with carrier transport between donor and recipient membranes . The endocytic pathway constitutes a network of spatially segregated sort - ing compartments that function to determine the cellular destination and fate of internalized cargo 1 , 2 . On internalization , cargo is transported to the peripheral sorting endosome — a dynamic tubular and vesicular compartment in which sorting decisions are made 3 . Nutrient receptors , such as those for transferrin ( Tfn ) , release their ligand in the endosomal lumen and are recycled back to the plasma membrane , either directly or via the endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) , which typically is in close proximity to the nucleus and the microtubule organizing centre ( MTOC ) 1 – 3 . In contrast , signalling receptors , such as those for epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , are sorted into regions that undergo inward bud - ding into the endosomal lumen to form a multivesicular body ( MVB ) 4 , 5 . As MVBs mature and fuse with the hydrolytic lysosome , this results in receptor degradation . The fate of endocytic cargo is largely determined by the activity of a number of endosomal sorting machineries , the molec - ular nature of which we are only beginning to understand . An important determinant of endosomal sorting is the coupling of endocytic organelles with actin - and microtubule - dependent motors 6 , 7 . Such interactions not only help induce the formation of transport carri - ers , but also drive their subsequent transport from the donor to recipient compartments . Thus , the minus end - directed microtubule motor dynein is required for early - to - late endosome transport , and the steady - state juxt - anuclear localization of the ERC 8 – 10 , whereas the plus end - directed kinesin motor KIF16B is required for endosomal sorting 11 . However , for many transport steps it remains to be determined how endosomal organelles are coupled to specific motors . Furthermore , it is unclear whether the process of cargo sorting into profiles destined to form carriers is coupled to the motors required to drive carrier formation and transport . One family of proteins increasingly implicated in endosomal sorting are sorting nexins ( SNXs ) , all of which contain a characteristic SNX PX domain 12 . In yeast , these proteins have a fundamental role in retrieving cargo away from the degradative pathway 13 . Vps5p is a component of the retromer — a sorting complex that retrieves the receptor Vps10p from the prevacuolar endosome back to the late - Golgi 14 . One mammalian ortho - logue is sorting nexin - 1 ( SNX1 ) , which , alongside other components of the mammalian retromer , regulates early endosome - to - trans - Golgi net - work ( TGN ) retrieval of the cation - independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( CI - MPR ) 15 – 17 . As the CI - MPR and Vps10p are functionally equivalent , Vps5p and SNX1 , and the other components of the retromer , therefore have an evolutionarily conserved function in endosomal sort - ing . It has yet to be determined whether such conservation is also true for other SNXs . Thus , although Mvp1p regulates cargo retrieval back to 1 The Henry Wellcome Integrated Signalling Laboratories , Department of Biochemistry , School of Medical Sciences , University of Bristol , Bristol BS8 1TD , UK . 2 Department of Biochemistry , School of Medical Sciences , University of Bristol , Bristol BS8 1TD , UK . 3 Department of Experimental Tumorbiology , University of Muenster , Badestrasse 9 , D - 48149 , Muenster , Germany . 4 Current address : Immunobiology and Infectious Disease , Guy’s Hospital , King’s College London , London SE1 9RT , UK . 5 Correspondence should be addressed to P .

Here , we define the function of mammalian SNX4 . We present data that indicate a role for SNX4 in coupling endosomal TfnR sorting with the long range transport of TfnR - containing carriers from early endo - somes to the ERC through assembly of a dynein motor complex . We propose that this complex enables coordination of endosomal sorting with carrier transport between donor and recipient membranes . RESULTS SNX4 association with the peripheral early endosome and the juxtanuclear recycling compartment To examine the cellular localization of SNX4 , an anti - SNX4 antibody was initially used to probe HeLa cells by immunofluorescence microscopy . Unfortunately , although this antibody was able to detect endogenous protein by western blotting ( see below ) , it failed to detect endogenous SNX4 by immunofluorescence microscopy ( data not shown ) . To over - come this problem , HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a GFP - tagged SNX4 chimera ( GFP – SNX4 ) . In agreement with previous data 22 , 23 , when expressed at low levels , GFP – SNX4 displayed a punctate cytoplas - mic distribution ( Fig . 1 ) . The SNX4 - labelled punctae displayed a signifi - cant , but not complete , colocalization with the early endosomal markers EEA1 and SNX1 ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Partial colocalization was also observed between the SNX4 punctae and Rab11 , a marker of the juxtanuclear ERC . Furthermore , SNX4 also showed a high degree of colocalization with the TfnR - labelled ERC ( Fig . 1d ) . Limited colocalization was observed with LAMP1 , a marker of the late endosome / lysosome ( Fig . 1e ) . These data are consistent with SNX4 residing at the interface of the peripheral early endosome and the juxtanuclear ERC . To associate with this compartment , SNX4 required a functional PtdIns ( 3 ) P - binding PX domain ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) , as GFP – SNX4 K132A ( a mutant targeting a residue crucial for PtdIns ( 3 ) P - binding in SNX1 ; ref . 16 ) displayed a cytosolic distribution ( Fig . 1g ) . In addition , a functional BAR domain was also required for membrane tar - geting , as the generation of a SNX4 site - directed mutant corresponding to the previously characterized SNX1 K429E , K430E , R431E ( this mutant is unable to bind membranes and has a cytosolic localization 16 ) was also entirely cytosolic ( Fig . 1h ) . The SNX4 - labelled endocytic compartment has a highly dynamic tubular – vesicular morphology In HeLa cells expressing low levels of transiently transfected GFP – SNX4 , the SNX4 compartment displayed a dynamic tubular – vesicular mor - phology that was reminiscent of that previously observed for SNX1 ( Fig . 2a and see Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) . Imaging of cells coexpressing GFP - tagged SNX1 and mCherry - tagged SNX4 revealed a complex relationship between the SNX1 and SNX4 - labelled compart - ments ( Fig . 2b and see Supplementary Information , Movie 2 ) . Tubular profiles enriched for each individual sorting nexin were observed to arise from common vesicular structures labelled for both SNX1 and SNX4 . Tfn and EGF receptor sorting through the SNX4 - labelled compartment was examined using Alexa 568 - labelled Tfn and Texas Red - labelled EGF . Although both receptors entered the SNX4 - labelled compartment , only TfnR exited via SNX4 - labelled carriers ( Fig . 2c and see Supplementary Information , Movie 3 ) and the EGFR was retained within the SNX4 - labelled vesicles ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) . This data is consistent with SNX4 being associated with a highly dynamic tubu - lar – vesicular compartment in which receptor sorting occurs . RNA interference ( RNAi ) - mediated suppression of SNX4 does not perturb retromer function To define the function of SNX4 , a pool of small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) duplexes were designed . Of this pool , siRNA duplexes 2 and 3 resulted in pronounced suppression of SNX4 ( Fig . 3a ) .

Consistent with this , in SNX4 - suppressed HeLa cells , the SNX1 and retromer - dependent retrograde endosome - to - TGN transport of the CI - MPR was not perturbed ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) . SNX4 is , therefore , not a functional component of the mammalian retromer and , similarly to the situation in yeast , its role in endosomal sorting is distinct to that of SNX1 . SNX4 suppression perturbs TfnR sorting As SNX4 is partially associated with the Rab11 - and TfnR - labelled juxta - nuclear ERC , we examined the trafficking of the TfnR in SNX4 - suppressed cells using 125 I - labelled Tfn . Compared to control cells , the amount of 125 I - labelled Tfn entering SNX4 - suppressed cells was significantly reduced , whereas the internalization of 125 I - labelled EGF was unaffected ( Fig . 3b ) . As the internalization and subsequent sorting of the EGFR was not per - turbed ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) , the effect of SNX4 suppression does not arise from a reduction in clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis or a global defect in endosomal sorting . To examine TfnR sorting , the subcellular localization of the receptor in SNX4 - suppressed cells was examined . This revealed that although the receptor was internalized , the strength of the TfnR labelling seemed greatly reduced .

Further examination of the subcellular distribution of the internalized receptor revealed that it was present in peripheral EEA1 - positive punctae and was not enriched in a juxtanu - clear localization indicative of the ERC ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Furthermore , the distribution of Rab11 was also perturbed , in that it was also dispersed in peripheral punctate ( Fig . 4a and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3 ) . These data establish that SNX4 regulates TfnR sorting away from the degradative pathway , such that in SNX4 - suppressed cells , the receptor is mis - sorted and enters the lysosomal degradative pathway . Furthermore , suppression of SNX4 results in an altered steady - state distribution of the ERC , such that markers of this compartment become enriched within peripheral early endosomes . SNX4 associates with the minus end - directed microtubule motor dynein To establish the mechanism by which SNX4 regulates endosomal sorting and transport to the ERC , a yeast two - hybrid screen was per - formed using full - length SNX4 .

This protein consists of two amino - terminal WW domains , an internal C2 - like domain and a carboxyl terminal glutamic acid - rich region ( Fig . 5c ) 24 , 25 . The KIBRA allele has been associated with hippocampal - mediated memory performance 26 , and the protein itself interacts with dynein light chain 1 ( DYNLL1 ; also known as Lc8 or PIN ) 25 . As DYNLL1 is a component of cytoplasmic dynein , a minus end - directed microtubule motor that is associated with the intracellular transport of various organelles including recycling endosomes 8 – 10 , the association of SNX4 with KIBRA was analysed in more detail . KIBRA was present in SNX4 immunoprecipitates ( Fig . 5d ) , as was the dynein intermediate chain ( DYNC1I2 ; Fig . 5e ) . Furthermore , in transiently transfected HeLa cells , KIBRA colocalized with SNX4 in cytosolic punc - tae — an association that required the activity of a wortmannin - sensitive PI ( 3 ) K ( Fig . 5f ) . Therefore , these data establish that SNX4 , through its association with KIBRA , forms a complex with the minus end - directed microtubule motor , dynein . Suppression of KIBRA , DYNLL1 or DYNC1I2 induces the dispersal of the juxtanuclear ERC Given the association of SNX4 with KIBRA and dynein , KIBRA - specific siRNAs were designed to examine its function in TfnR sorting . In HeLa cells , each individual siRNA strongly suppressed KIBRA expression ( Fig . 6a ) , but did not induce a detectable decrease in endogenous SNX4 ( Fig . 6a ) . Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that although suppression of KIBRA did not effect the internalization of TfnR , it did perturb subsequent trafficking to the juxtanuclear ERC , with the TfnR becoming enriched in EEA1 - posi - tive peripheral punctae ( Fig . 6b ) . Interestingly , suppression of either SNX4 or KIBRA uncoupled these peripheral punctae from long - range saltatory movement ( Fig . 6c ) . Unlike the situation with SNX4 suppression , the level of TfnR , as judged by the intensity of the Alexa 568 – Tfn signal or by west - ern blotting , was not strongly reduced in KIBRA - suppressed cells ( Fig . 6a ) . Thus , although suppression of KIBRA phenocopies that of SNX4 with regard to the dispersal of the TfnR - labelled juxtanu - clear ERC , it does not bring about mis - sorting of the receptor into the lysosomal degradative pathway . Similarly , compared to lamin A / C - depleted controls ( Fig . 7a , b ) , depletion of DYNLL1 ( Fig . 7c , d ) , dynein heavy chain ( DHC1 ; Fig . 7e , f ) , or DYNC1I2 ( Fig . 7g , h ) inhibited the accumulation of Alexa 568 – Tfn at the juxtanu - clear ERC . Golgi morphology ( observed via the Golgi marker GRASP - 65 ) in depleted cells is included as a control , as dynein is required to maintain the characteristic juxtanuclear clustering of the Golgi 9 . Furthermore , depletion of DYNLL1 and DYNC1I2 was confirmed by immunoblotting ( Fig . 7i , j ) . Taken together , these data are consistent with a requirement for the dynein motor in the transfer of Alexa 568 – Tfn from the peripheral early endosome to the juxtanuclear ERC . Importantly , as judged by either the inten - sity of the Alexa 568 – Tfn signal ( Fig . 7b , d , f , h ) or by western blotting for the TfnR ( Fig . 7k ) , suppression of dynein , unlike sup - pression of SNX4 , did not result in a mis - sorting of the receptor into the lysosomal degradative pathway . Overall , these data argue that SNX4 regulates TfnR sorting away from the lysosomal - deg - radation route , coordinating this with dynein - dependent move - ment of carriers from the peripheral early endosome towards the juxtanuclear ERC ( Fig . 8 ) . DISCUSSION Here , we report the association of SNX4 with tubular and vesicular ele - ments of an endocytic compartment that lies at the interface between the peripheral early endosome and the juxtanuclear ERC . We have estab - lished that , through an interaction with a protein called KIBRA 24 , 25 , SNX4 associates with the minus end - directed microtubule motor dynein . By demonstrating that suppression of SNX4 , KIBRA or dynein proteins perturbs the long - range transport of TfnR from the peripheral early endosome , we provide evidence for the involvement of this complex in the recycling of this receptor . In addition , we have established that SNX4 is involved in the process of sorting internalized TfnR away from lysosomal degradation into the juxtanuclear recycling pathway . This study , therefore , defines the basic function of SNX4 in TfnR sorting and transport , and in doing so establishes a link between the process of endosomal sorting and the transport of carriers from donor to recipient compartments . The targeting of SNX4 to the tubular and vesicular elements of an endosomal compartment that lies at the interface between peripheral early endosomes and the juxtanuclear ERC arises through the mem - brane binding properties of its BAR domain and PtdIns ( 3 ) P - binding PX domain 27 , 28 .

However , the PX domain of SNX1 binds with similar affinities to PtdIns ( 3 ) P and the related lipid PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( ref . 16 ) . Given evidence that the production of PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 may be important for endosome - to - TGN transport 29 – 32 , it is tempting to speculate that the ability to sense PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , may target SNX1 to tubular elements of the early endosome involved in retrograde traffic to the TGN , rather than tubular profiles that are directed into the recycling pathway . These data are consistent with a model in which the phosphoinositide - binding specificity of the PX domain of SNX proteins aids their targeting to distinct membrane com - partments . Furthermore , the PX domain of SNX9 binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 — an interaction that aids the association of this protein with the plasma - membrane , from where it regulates endocytosis 33 , 34 . a b SD – Leu – Trp SD – Leu – Trp SD – Ade – His – Leu – Trp SD – Ade – His – Leu – Trp Lamin Lamin SNX1 SNX1 SNX4 SNX4 pGBKT7 pGBKT7 Bait : Bait : Prey : SNX4 C - terminal Prey : KIBRA C - terminal WW domains C2 - like Glu - rich c d e f IP : C o n t r o l C o n t r o l G F P – S N X 4 G F P - S N X 4 M y c – K I BR A M r ( K ) M r ( K ) 100 75 WB : Myc WB : DYNC1I2 ( 74 . 1 ) IP : D Y NC 1 I 2 Merge mChery – SNX4 GFP – KIBRA W o r t m a nn i n Figure 5 SNX4 interacts with the dynein interactor KIBRA .

Although we have not directly defined the ability of the SNX4 BAR domain to drive membrane deformation in vitro , GFP – SNX4 - expressing cells display an enhanced tubular morphology , which is consistent with the BAR domain of SNX4 assisting in membrane deformation and the formation of membrane tubules . In this regard , the dynein motor can also induce membrane tubulation in vitro when it is associated with liposomes in the presence of microtubules and ATP 35 . Therefore , the demonstration that SNX4 can associate indirectly with the dynein motor ( containing at least DYNLL1 and DYNC1I2 ) , suggests a mechanism by which membrane deformation driven by a BAR domain can be coupled to a molecular motor , which may assist in membrane tubulation and / or the process of membrane fission . Given such a precedent , it will be important to establish whether other SNX - BAR proteins also couple , either directly or indi - rectly , to molecular motors and , thus coordinate endosomal sorting with the formation and transport of carriers between donor and recipient compartments . Through suppression of the SNX4 protein , we have established that this SNX has no apparent function in the retromer - mediated endosome - to - TGN retrieval of the CI - MPR . Similarly to their yeast orthologues 20 , the functions of mammalian SNX1 and SNX4 in endosomal sorting are , therefore , distinct . In fact , although yeast do not seem to recycle cargo from endosomes directly to the plasma membrane ( this occurs via the late Golgi 13 ) , the recycling of variants of the ABC transporter Ste6 , although not affected in ∆vps35 retromer mutant , is partially affected in ∆snx4 cells 21 . Given our characterization of the function of SNX4 in the sorting and transport of TfnR into a recycling pathway , the basic function of SNX4 in regulating the retrieval of cargo away from the degradative route into a recycling pathway seems to be conserved between yeast and mammals . The TfnR phenotype observed in SNX4 - suppressed cells arises through a defect in the endosomal sorting of the receptor , combined with a decrease in transport from the peripheral early endosome to the juxtanuclear ERC . The sorting defect is manifested as a mis - sorting of the TfnR from the normal recycling route into a degradative pathway that is sensitive to lysosomal inhibitors .

We have been unable to detect any direct association between SNX4 and the isolated cytoplasmic tail of the TfnR ( data not shown ) . One protein that has been implicated in TfnR sorting through a direct association is the BAR domain - contain - ing protein ACAP1 ( ref . 36 ) . This protein resides on the juxtanuclear endocytic recycling compartment , from where it regulates TfnR recy - cling back to the cell surface 36 . ACAP1 is , therefore , at a distinct point in the TfnR recycling pathway from our proposed role for SNX4 at the interface between early endosomes and the juxtanuclear endocytic recy - cling compartment . That said , we have examined the potential associa - tion of SNX4 and ACAP1 . ACAP1 was not isolated during our extensive yeast two - hybrid screen with SNX4 , although we have detected interac - tions with other BAR domain - containing proteins in this and other SNX protein screens ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , in pulldown assays in cells transiently cotransfected with SNX4 and ACAP1 , we were unable to detect any clear , reproducible association ( data not shown ) . Clearly , these data do not exclude the possibility that these proteins do interact , but given the published work on ACAP1 , we favour a model in which SNX4 lies upstream of ACAP1 in the sorting and recycling of the internalized TfnR ( Fig . 8 ) . As SNX4 can drive membrane tubulation , we propose a model that encompasses the concept of iterative , geometric - based sorting 1 . Here , as the surface - area - to - volume ratio of narrow tubules exiting the endosome exceeds that of the vesicular component of the endosome , membrane cargo that lack specific targeting sequences ( as has been proposed for the TfnR 37 , 38 ) leave the endosome with the bulk flow of membrane . Although this is not sufficient to account for the efficiency of TfnR sorting into the recycling pathway in a single process , if tubule formation and budding is iterative , then highly efficient sorting will be achieved 39 . Therefore , we propose that SNX4 functions in such geometric - based sorting of the internalized TfnR through its ability to drive membrane tubulation . By defining the association of SNX4 with the dynein - binding protein KIBRA , we have established a mechanism by which carrier transport between the early endosome and the ERC is achieved .

Cells were placed on ice and the 125 I - labelled Tfn remaining at the cell surface was stripped using ice - cold 0 . 2 M acetic acid , 0 . 5 M NaCl at pH 4 . 5 for 2 min , then washed extensively with ice - cold PBS . Cells were chased into DHB containing 50 µg ml – 1 cold Tfn for the indicated times . At the end of each time point , media was removed and separated into acid precipitable material ( recycled counts ) and acid - soluble material ( degraded counts ) by incubation with 3 % trichloroacetic acid , 0 . 3 % phosphotungsic acid for 30 min at 4 °C followed by high - speed centrifugation . A 2 min acid strip with 0 . 2 M acetic acid , 0 . 5 M NaCl at pH 2 . 8 removed Tfn bound to receptors at the cell surface . Cells were solubilized with 1 M NaOH at room temperature for 30 min . Fractions were subjected to gamma counting . Recycled counts were determined by summing acid precipitable counts and counts removed by the acetic acid strip . Degraded counts were deemed the acid - soluble counts and counts released on solubilization of the cell monolayer were deemed internalized counts . For 125 I - labelled EGF trafficking assays , cells were washed into DHB and incubated at 4 °C with 1 kBq per well 125 I - labelled EGF for 1 h . 125 I - labelled EGF bound to the cell surface was internalized by warming the cells to 37 °C for 5 min . Cells were returned to ice and 125 I - labelled EGF remaining at the cell surface was removed by a mild acid strip ( 0 . 2 M acetic acid , 0 . 5 M NaCl at pH 4 . 5 ) and washed extensively with ice - cold PBS . Remaining cell surface receptors were saturated with 100 ng ml – 1 EGF in DHB for 30 min at 4 °C , at which point cells were returned to 37 °C for the chase - time indicated . At the end of the chase , media was removed and a 2 min acid strip with 0 . 2 M acetic acid , 0 . 5 M NaCl at pH 2 . 8 , removed 125 I - labelled EGF bound to receptors at the cell surface . Cells were solubilized with 1 M NaOH at room temperature for 30 min and recycled , degraded and internalized counts were collected as for the 125 I - labelled Tfn trafficking assays . Yeast two - hybrid screen . A yeast two - hybrid screen was performed using the Matchmaker III system ( Clontech , Oxford , UK ) . Full - length human SNX4 cloned into pGBKT7 was used as bait and mated with a pretransformed human adult brain two - hybrid library ( Clontech , Oxford , UK ) . Yeast clones with positive bait – prey interactions were selected on SD – Leu – Trp – Ade – His plates supplemented with 1 mM 3ʹAT . DNA was isolated from positive colonies and the interacting prey was subsequently identified by sequenc - ing ( MWG Biotech , Ebersberg , Germany ) . Interactions were confirmed by cotransformation of yeast AH109 cells with the isolated prey vectors and the SNX4 bait vector or a negative control construct . Double transformants were selected on SD – Leu – Trp agar plates and two independent clones were replaced on SD – Leu – Trp agar plates and SD – Leu – Trp – Ade – His plates supplemented with 1 mM 3ʹAT and α - X - Gal ( Glycosynth , Cheshire , UK ) to test for protein – protein interaction Immunoprecipitation . HeLa cells were cotransfected with SNX4 and KIBRA constructs and incubated for 24 h until approximately 90 % confluent . Cells were then lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer ( 20 mM Tris – HCl at pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % NP40 ) with a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Burgess Hill , UK ) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with primary antibodies , followed by incu - bation with protein - G – agarose beads ( Upstate , Chandlers Ford , UK ) . Complexes were washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer , followed by boiling in NuPAGE LDS sample ( Invitrogen ) buffer with 5 % β - mercaptoethanol for 5 min before SDS – PAGE ( Invitrogen ) and immunoblotting .

Cells were chased into 100 ng / ml cold EGF containing media for various times at 37 o C . Recycled , degraded and internalised fractions were subjected to gamma counting . Figure S3 . In SNX4 suppressed cells Rab11a and EEA1 partial co - localise in peripheral dispersed punctae . Images are from the same set of experiments as shown in Figure 5 . Here , HeLa cells were treated with control or SNX4 specific siRNA duplex 2 for 72 hours prior to incubation with Alexa 568 - Tfn ( 25 µg / ml ) for 60 minutes in order to label the ERC , after which cells were fixed and stained with anti - EEA1 and anti - Rab11a antibody . Cells were subsequently imaged by confocal microscopy and co - localisation was analysed between Rab11a and EEA1 .
