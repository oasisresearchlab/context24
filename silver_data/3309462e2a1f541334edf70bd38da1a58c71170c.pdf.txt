( stuart _ schreiber @ harvard . edu ) Abstract The aberrant localization of proteins in cells is a key factor in the development of various diseases , including cancer and neurodegenerative disease . To better understand and potentially manipulate protein localization for therapeutic purposes , we engineered bifunctional compounds that bind to proteins in separate cellular compartments . We show these compounds induce nuclear import of cytosolic cargoes , using nuclear - localized BRD4 as a “carrier” for co - import and nuclear trapping of cytosolic proteins . We use this system to calculate kinetic constants for passive diffusion across the nuclear pore and demonstrate single - cell heterogeneity in response to these bifunctional molecules , with cells requiring high carrier to cargo expression for complete import . We also observe incorporation of cargoes into BRD4 - containing condensates . Proteins shown to be substrates for nuclear transport include oncogenic mutant nucleophosmin ( NPM1c ) and mutant PI3K catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA E545K ) , suggesting potential applications to cancer treatment . In addition , we demonstrate that chemical - induced localization of BRD4 to cytosolic - localized DNA - binding proteins , namely , IRF1 with a nuclear export signal , induces target gene expression . These results suggest that induced localization of proteins with bifunctional molecules enables the rewiring of cell circuitry with significant implications for disease therapy . Introduction Cells partition their components into separate compartments to regulate information flow and to concentrate biomolecules . Eukaryotic cells possess two main compartments , the cytosol , and the nucleus . The trafficking of proteins across the nuclear membrane can be either passive , in the case of proteins less than 90 kDa , or facilitated by active transport 1 , 2 . Recent research further emphasizes the importance of protein spatial localization , as demonstrated by the discovery and diverse functions of phase - separated biomolecular condensates 3 . The translocation of proteins from one compartment to another is the defining event in several biological cascades . Examples include the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol to initiate apoptosis , or conversely the sequestration of eIF2α to membraneless stress granules for translational pausing , facilitating survival upon cellular stress 4 , 5 . Nuclear transport in particular is often a potent signaling event ; many transcription factors typically reside in the cytosol but translocate to the nucleus upon activation . These transcription factors include the FoxO , STAT , and nuclear hormone receptor families of proteins 6 – 8 . Given the diverse biological processes that are impacted by alternative protein localization , we sought to develop molecules that can control protein localization . We hypothesized that chemical - induced proximity could be used to induce the co - localization of proteins that normally exist in opposing compartments and thereby translocate one from its normal location to a new one . Earlier work has demonstrated that altering the localization of proteins is possible using the FKBP / FRB system 9 . We aimed to explore whether bifunctional compounds could be used to move proteins without the use of a dual - tagging system by leveraging a small - molecule binder of the endogenous protein BRD4 . We reveal bifunctional small molecules capable of inducing protein translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus . Such molecules may have important applications in human health , including cancer treatment . 2 Results Chemical - induced proximity with BRD4 rapidly induces nuclear localization of the targeted protein . We hypothesized that chemical - induced proximity of a protein of interest with a constitutively nuclear protein would induce nuclear localization of the target protein ( Fig . 1A ) . To achieve this , we sought out proteins that are abundant , nuclear localized and have well - validated small - molecule binders that could be functionalized . Bromodomain - containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) is one such protein , and ( + ) - JQ1 , a small - molecule binder of BET - containing proteins including BRD4 , has been used to make a variety of bifunctional compounds 10 . We synthesized a bifunctional molecule consisting of JQ1 and AP1867 , a high affinity ( K d = 94 pM ) ligand of FKBP F36V , 11 with a PEG 2 - diamine linker : Nuclear Import and Control of Expression compound 1 ( NICE - 01 , Fig . 1B ) . Cells co - transfected with FKBP F36V - mEGFP and mCherry - BRD4 showed rapid translocation of FKBP F36V - EGFP to the nucleus following addition of NICE - 01 ( 200 nM , 40 minutes ; Fig . 1C ) . One defining characteristic of bifunctional compounds , as opposed to molecular glues , is the observation of a dose - response that decreases at very high compound concentrations called the “hook effect” 12 . To confirm that the observed translocation is due to the bifunctional nature of NICE - 01 , we performed a dose - titration and found that nuclear translocation does not occur at a higher compound concentration of 10μM ( Fig . 1D ) . Recent studies have highlighted the importance of stoichiometry of the proteins involved in ternary complex formation for the biological activity of bifunctional molecules 13 . We also find that the stoichiometry of the components of the ternary complex was key to nuclear import . Indeed , we observed weaker FKBP F36V - mEGFP import when reliant on endogenous BET - containing proteins , with lack of mEGFP cytosolic exclusion ( Fig . S1 ) , likely related to the exceptionally high protein levels achieved through transient transfection compared to endogenous proteins . This observation suggests that cell specificity of nuclear import is quantitatively influenced by expression of the nuclear - localized carrier . Ligand affinity appears important as well . Bifunctional molecules constructed from synthetic ligand of FKBP ( SLF ) , which binds with low micromolar affinity to wild - type FKBP 14 , instead of AP1867 , required much higher concentrations ( 5 μM ) to induce nuclear localization of FKBP - mEGFP in the presence of mCherry - BRD4 ( data not shown ) . mEGFP nuclear import may conceivably occur through two mechanisms . First , the protein of interest may co - import with BRD4 in the presence of bifunctional molecules , like how smaller Mediator complex subunits without NLSs “piggyback” off of larger NLS - containing subunits 15 . Second , the protein of interest may passively diffuse across the nuclear pore ; in this case , the bifunctional molecule shifts the equilibrium towards the nucleus by sequestering the nuclear fraction with BRD4 thereby preventing export ( “nuclear trapping” ) . To distinguish between these possibilities , we tested the cancer - driver PIK3CA E545K mutant in our system , which is too large to passively diffuse across the nuclear pore ( 110 kDa ; 149 kDa with FKBP F36V - mEGFP N - terminal fusion ) . 2 NICE - 01 was able to import FKBP F36V - mEGFP - PIK3CA E545K in cells co - transfected with mCherry - BRD4 ( Fig . S2 ) , indicating that co - import occurs . However , the time required for import ( ~ 3 hours ) was much longer than FKBP F36V - mEGFP , consistent with nuclear trapping predominating on shorter timescales . While nearly all cells co - transfected with FKBP F36V - EGFP and mCherry - BRD4 showed complete nuclear localization of GFP within 1 hour , only about half of cells transfected with FKBP F36V - mEGFP - PIK3CA E545K showed nuclear localization within 3 hours , and often only partial nuclear localization at steady state . This observation demonstrates that not all proteins will be equally amenable to nuclear import . As diffusion of protein cargos across the nuclear membrane is required for nuclear trapping on short time scales , we hypothesized that the kinetic parameters of protein diffusion across the nuclear membrane could be calculated using the observed shift in FKBP F36V - mEGFP concentration upon compound treatment . We constructed a model of the steps in nuclear relocalization ( Fig . S3 ; Supplementary Information ) . The fraction of cytosolic FKBP F36V - mEGFP was quantified for individual cells . Nuclear import showed first - order kinetics with respect to FKBP F36V - mEGFP fraction in the cytoplasm after a short initial period ( during which nuclear FKBP F36V - mEGFP forms a ternary complex with mCherry - BRD4 and NICE - 01 ) ; k import was estimated to be 0 . 0266 min - 1 ( Fig . S3 ) . Therefore , half of all cytosolic FKBP F36V - mEGFP ( 39 . 4 kDa ) crosses the nuclear membrane every 26 minutes in the presence of NICE - 01 . This estimate is near the rate of passive import of similarly sized maltose - binding protein ( MBP , 42 . 5 kDa ) in HeLa cells ( k import = 0 . 0132 min - 1 , t 1 / 2 = 53 minutes ) 16 . These data indicate that a bifunctional compound that binds BRD4 induces nuclear import of target proteins . Nuclear localizing bifunctional compounds correct the localization of the cancer - associated nucleophosmin protein and alter nuclear condensates The most common subtype of acute myeloid leukemia is defined by heterozygous mutations in the NPM1 gene that cause its aberrant cytosolic localization ( NPM1c ) 17 . Mutations in NPM1 occur exclusively at the C - terminus of the protein and induce a frameshift that simultaneously abolishes a nucleolar localization signal and introduces a neo - nuclear export signal ( NES ) . The neo - NES causes exportin - 1 ( XPO1 , CRM1 ) to bind and export the protein from the nucleus , shifting the equilibrium of protein localization to a predominantly cytosolic pattern in a dominant negative manner as NPM1c oligomerizes with wild - type NPM1 18 – 20 . Prior work has suggested that re - localizing the cytoplasmic mutant NPM1c into the nucleus can reduce the expression of HOX genes , thereby inducing leukemic differentiation and cell death 21 . We sought to determine whether nuclear relocalizing bifunctional compounds could be used to relocalize this mutant NPM1c into the nucleus . Cells co - transfected with FKBP F36V - mEGFP - NPM1c and mCherry - BRD4 showed 3 rapid re - localization of FKBP F36V - mEGFP - NPM1c into the nucleus within minutes upon treatment with NICE - 01 ( Fig . 2A - B , P = 4 . 4e - 185 for Mann - Whitney U test between distribution cellular mEGFP - mCherry correlation before compound addition and 25 minutes after NICE - 01 addition ) . Interestingly , not all cells showed a uniform response to treatment with compound ; duration required for mEGFP nuclear import varied , and nuclear relocalization was not observed in all cells . We observed that cells with low degree of NPM1c import often had lower mCherry - BRD4 intensity . We hypothesized that an excess of BRD4 might be required for efficient nuclear import . At an intermediate time point ( 25 minutes ) , we identified a significantly higher ratio of FKBP F36V - EGFP - NPM1c to mCherry - BRD4 in cells that did not respond ( Fig . 2C , P = 7 . 7e - 9 for Kolmogorov - Smirnov test between distribution of log 2 ( cellular mEGFP / mCherry ratio ) for mEGFP - mCherry colocalized versus mEGFP - mCherry non - colocalized cells ) . Taken together , these data suggest that the stoichiometry of components of the ternary complex can impact the phenotypic response to bifunctional compounds and may explain observed single - cell phenotypic heterogeneity . We hypothesized that bifunctional compounds could enforce co - localization of proteins not only within macro - compartments , but also within smaller intracellular compartments such as phase - separated condensates . We performed high - resolution microscopy imaging every minute in U2OS cells co - transfected with NPM1c and BRD4 , treated with NICE - 01 , and confirmed that NPM1c in the cytosol and in nucleolar condensates moved into BRD4 condensates , mostly in the nucleus and sometimes in the cytosol ( Fig . 2D ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) . We confirmed these structures were condensates by observing them undergo fusion and fission over several minutes ( Fig . 2E - F ) . These findings indicate proximity - inducing molecules can alter condensate composition in a targeted manner . We next sought to determine if other nuclear carriers could be used to induce the localization of NPM1c into the nucleus and we hypothesized that p53 could be one such carrier . 293T cells were transfected with FKBP F36V - mEGFP - NPM1c and Halo - p53 R273H - mCherry , which to our surprise demonstrated that Halo - p53 R273H - mCherry was localized to the cytoplasm only when co - transfected with FKBP F36V - mEGFP - NPM1c ( Fig . 3A ) . These findings are corroborated by a recent report 22 . Figure 1 : Rapid import of GFP into the nucleus by AP1867 - PEG2 - JQ1 ( NICE - 01 ) .

Therefore , NPM1c - mediated p53 export could represent a significant contribution to the oncogenicity of the mutation , which is not well understood . This is supported by three lines of evidence . First , the genes for p53 and its E3 ligases , Mdm2 and Mdm4 , are the top co - dependencies of NPM1 inactivation across the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia 23 ( RNAi Achilles + DRIVE + Marcotte , DEMETER2 ; Fig . 3B ) . Second , the only NPM1c - mutant AML cell line in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia , OCI - AML3 , which has wild - type TP53 , displays the smallest fitness gain upon TP53 knockout of all TP53 wild - type AML cell lines ( Fig . 3C ) . Third , NPM1c mutations are mutually exclusive with p53 mutations in AML ( P = 1 . 2e - 6 for Fisher exact test on OHSU AML cohort , Fig . 3D ) 24 . However , NICE - 01 could not relocalize Halo - p53 R273H - mCherry in 293T cells expressing BRD4 - Flag and FKBP F36V - mEGFP - NPM1c , suggesting that p53 is not consistently physically tethered to NPM1c in such a way that it must always co - localize ( Fig . 3E ) . Chemical - induced import of cytosolic transcription factor and induction of transcriptional response The nuclear membrane sometimes acts as a barrier to prevent the activation of transcription factors that normally reside in the cytosol 25 . Upon activation , these transcription factors translocate to the nucleus where they can bind their target sites and induce transcription . Transcription factors that follow this pattern include nuclear hormone receptors ER , AR , and some of the STAT and IRF family proteins 7 , 8 , 26 . We hypothesized that NICE - 01 could induce the nuclear import and transcriptional activation of such cytosolic transcription Figure 3 : NPM1c exports p53 out of the nucleus and fails to import p53 upon addition of bifunctional compound .

Top right cell displays FKBP F36V - mEGFP - NPM1c import but lack of p53 co - import . 6 factors . We selected the prototypical IRF family member , IRF1 , for its restricted and well - described transcriptional profile 27 , 28 . An NES was appended to IRF1 to aid in the detection of nuclear translocation and facilitate the use of this construct in an “up - assay” . In the absence of bifunctional compound , FKBP F36V - mEGFP - IRF1 - NES was excluded from the nucleus ( Fig . S4 ) . We observed rapid mEGFP import ( < 20 minutes ) in cells co - expressing mCherry - BRD4 and FKBP F36V - mEGFP - IRF1 - NES when treated with NICE - 01 ( 250 nM ) . However , we could not detect FKBP F36V - mEGFP - IRF1 - NES import in the absence of exogenous BRD4 by light microscopy , likely due to a large excess of FKBP F36V - mEGFP - IRF1 - NES compared to BRD4 ( Fig . S4 ) . Though not visibly apparent , we hypothesized that nuclear residence time of transcriptionally active FKBP F36V - mEGFP - IRF1 - NES was substantially increasing under these conditions and FKBP F36V - mEGFP - IRF1 - NES could be getting incorporated into BRD4 condensates driving expression of IRF1 target genes . Consistent with this hypothesis , we found significant u pregulation of IRF1 ChIP - seq targets 29 including IFI6 , MT2A , IFI1 , and B2M by RNA - seq ( P = 3 . 4e - 9 for one sample t - test versus μ = 0 ) in 293T cells treated with NICE - 01 ( 250 nM ) and expressing FKBP F36V - mEGFP - IRF1 - NES ( Fig . 4A ) . We also observed significant positive enrichment of the hallmark interferon response gene sets by gene set enrichment analysis 30 ( IFNα , NES = 3 . 31 , q < 0 . 001 ; IFNγ , NES = 3 . 26 , q < 0 . 001 ; Fig . 4B ) . Therefore , we demonstrate chemical - induced localization of BRD4 to cytosolic transcription factors is sufficient to induce expression of their target genes . Discussion The regulated localization of proteins into different cellular compartments is critical for proper cellular function . Here we use chemical - induced proximity between proteins that natively occupy different compartments to change localization of the targeted protein . It was initially unclear whether inducing proximity between a nuclear protein and a cytosolic protein would cause the nuclear import of the cytosolic protein , the export of the nuclear protein or some equilibrium between the two . We had originally hypothesized for example that NPM1c would export BRD4 from the nucleus . In the nucleus , BRD4 makes contact with several large macromolecules such as the mediator complex , a 31 - protein complex of proteins that collectively has 26 predicted annotated nuclear localization signals 15 . In this case , the transport equilibrium could heavily favor nuclear localization even when bound to an NES - containing protein like NPM1 due to a sort of NES - NLS voting mechanism . In principle , bifunctional compounds could transport nuclear proteins out of the nucleus if the mechanisms favoring export overcome those favoring import . Indeed , chemical - induced proximity with rapamycin has been used to deplete FRB - fused nuclear proteins from the nucleus through co - export with FKBP - fused ribosomal subunits , which display massive flux out of the nucleus during ribosome maturation 31 . Detailing bifunctional molecules that can localize proteins to the various compartments in the cell is an important area for future research . We also observed that the stoichiometry of ternary complex components appears to impact nuclear import significantly . When relying on the relatively low levels of endogenous BRD4 for import of a highly expressed construct , we observed weaker nuclear enrichment of the target protein . Moreover , cells with high relative NPM1c expression compared to BRD4 were less likely to display NPM1c import . These findings lead us to believe compound - induced nuclear import could occur for two endogenously expressed proteins when their expression level is similar or when the nuclear - localized protein is in Figure 4 : Import of cytosolic - localized transcription factor into the nucleus drives transcription .

Top ranked positively enriched gene sets are shown . 7 greater abundance . They also imply that if one uses a lineage - or cancer cell - specific nuclear protein as a “carrier” , one can restrict the target population of cells where the cargo is being imported . These stoichiometry restrictions likely apply to all induced - proximity systems requiring interactions over long time scales , such as molecular glues . For rapamycin , the abundance of the presenter ( FKBP12 , 2 . 9×10 6 copies / cell in 293T ; OpenCell 32 ) is in far excess of the target ( mTOR , 6 . 9×10 4 copies / cell in 293T ; OpenCell 32 ) . For systems only needing transient interactions , such as bifunctional molecules inducing post - translational modifications , this may be less relevant . To our knowledge this is also the first observation of significant single - cell heterogeneity in the phenotypic response to bifunctional compounds . Stochastic variation in the abundance of proteins targeted by chemotherapeutics has previously been shown to underlie single - cell phenotypic heterogeneity 33 . This observation raises the possibility that similar heterogeneity may be widespread , and possibly therapeutically important for several emerging therapeutic classes of bifunctional compounds . Because protein localization controls diverse biological phenomena , the ability to pharmacologically perturb localization may offer control over such biological phenomena . We believe this may have important therapeutic implications . For instance , NPM1c is an AML driver that induces dominant negative NPM1 cytosolic localization 18 , 20 . We attempted to correct this directly by showing it can be relocalized to the nucleus with a bifunctional small molecule . However , one may prefer relocalization to the nucleolus , where wild - type NPM1 normally resides ; this may require a nucleolar carrier . Secondly , relocalization may not be sufficient to yield a phenotype , as evidenced by the lack of p53 co - import . In other cases , we hypothesize that future therapeutics may divert an oncogenic protein from its normal substrates . We showed that oncogenic PIK3CA mutant protein can be diverted from the plasma membrane where it normally interacts with phosphoinositols , into the nucleus . Future research should focus on the future applications and functional consequences of such relocalizations . One notable observation during our experiments , especially with NPM1 , was the change in the composition of cellular condensates . We noted relocalization of cytosolic and nucleolar NPM1c to BRD4 condensates . Therefore , chemical inducers of proximity may represent a modular strategy to alter condensate composition . BRD4 condensates are especially interesting due to their role in transcription 34 . We show that import of a cytosolic transcription factor with endogenous BET containing proteins can strongly induce transcription . This is consistent with results from previous studies using bifunctionals to recruit BRD4 to targeted sites 35 – 37 . Overall , these data demonstrate that protein localization can be modulated in human cells by bifunctional molecules that bind proteins in different cellular compartments . The practical application of this approach , proved here using binders to FKBP F36V and BRD4 , will require the identification and optimization of protein - specific binding molecules . We anticipate that future bifunctional relocalizing molecules will have important applications in scientific discovery and human therapeutics . Acknowledgements We dedicate this work to Peter J .

All cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , and 100 IU / mL of penicillin , 100 μg / mL of streptomycin at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Transient Transfection . Cells were transfected using TransIT - LT1 following the manufacturer’s protocol . Microscopy . Cells were imaged using Operetta CLS High Content Analysis System ( PerkinElmer ) or Opera 8 Phenix Plus High - Content Screening System ( PerkinElmer ) in 96 - or 384 - well plates at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were split into plates 24 hours prior to transfection . Cells were imaged 24 - 48 hours following transfection , with media being replaced immediately before imaging with FluoroBrite DMEM containing 10 % FBS . Compounds were added to fresh FluoroBrite DMEM , vortexed for 30 seconds , and the media was then added to cells and they were re - imaged between 0 minutes to 24 hours after addition . RNA Sequencing . 293T cells were transfected with FKBP F36V - mEGFP - IRF1 - NES and treated with NICE - 01 ( 250nM ) or the combination of NH2 - PEG2 - JQ1 and AP1867 ( 250 nM each ) for one day . Prior to RNA extraction , cells were washed once with cold PBS , TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) was added to cells , and RNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s protocol . RNA concentration was measured using a Qubit Fluorometer ( ThermoFisher ) , and RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer . RNA - sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit ( Illumina ) . Paired - end 150bp sequencing was done on a NovaSeq 6000 machine ( Illumina ) . RNA - seq Analysis . STAR / RSEM was used to align paired end RNA - seq reads to the GENCODE v38 transcript reference . The raw counts were rounded , and DESeq2 was used to compare bifunctional versus binder treated replicates . We restricted to genes with baseMean ≥ 10 counts . A preranked GSEA was conducted using the DESeq2 t - statistic as the rank metric . Co - dependency Analysis . RNAi scores for NPM1 across DepMap were correlated with RNAi dependency scores for all other genes 38 . The resulting correlation coefficients were plotted versus q - values derived from Benjamini - Hochberg correction of Pearson correlation significance results . Comut Analysis . The OHSU acute myeloid leukemia cohort was queried on cBioPortal for NPM1 and TP53 mutations . A comut generated from cBioPortal is shown 39 , 40 . Microscopy Analysis . For kinetic analyses , ImageJ 41 was used to quantify average cell mEGFP intensity ( I avg , cell ) , cell area ( A cell ) , average nuclear mEGFP intensity ( I avg , n ) , nuclear area ( A n ) , and background intensity ( I avg , b ) . These parameters were used to calculate mEGFP cytosolic fraction : f cyto = ( ( I avg , cell - I avg , b ) A cell - ( I avg , n - I avg , b ) A n ) / ( A cell ( I avg , cell - I avg , b ) ) . CellProfiler 42 was used for analysis of NPM1c transfected cells . Cells were identified as primary objects using a highlighted mCherry channel ( which stains the entire cell due to detection of mCherry - BRD4 synthesized in the cytosol ) with diameters of at least 15 pixels . The intensity and colocalization of non - enhanced ( standard exposure ) mCherry and mEGFP were computed in the identified cells . Integrated intensities and mCherry - mEGFP pixel Pearson correlation were used in downstream analysis . References 1 . Kalderon , D . ; Roberts , B . L . ; Richardson , W . D . ; Smith , A . E .

Commercial reagents were used for chemical synthesis without additional purification . Reactions were performed in round - bottom flasks with Teflon - coated magnetic stir bars . The progress of the reactions was tracked using ultra - performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry . This analysis was conducted on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC I - Class 15 PLUS System with an ACQUITY SQ Detector 2 . Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectra were obtained at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard using a Bruker AVANCE III HD 400 MHz spectrometer at room temperature ( 1 H NMR , 400 MHz ) . Chemical shifts for 1H NMR are given in parts per million ( ppm ) and referenced to residual solvent signals . DMSO - d6 was acquired from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories , Inc . 1 H NMR data is reported as follows : chemical shift value in ppm , multiplicity ( s = singlet , d = doublet , t = triplet , dd = doublet of doublets , and m = multiplet ) , coupling constant value in Hz , and integration value .
