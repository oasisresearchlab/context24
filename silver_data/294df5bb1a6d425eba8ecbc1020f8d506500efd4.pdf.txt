Introduction Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease ( CMT ) is one of the most common inherited neuropathy , with estimated prevalence of 17 to 40 in 100 , 000 affected ( Patzkó , & Shy , 2011 ) . CMT is characterized by atrophy of muscle tissue and loss of touch sensation of limb , predominantly in the feet and legs , foot drop , and hammer toes . The most frequent initial symptoms include foot drop , claw toe , and muscle wasting in the hands . Symptoms in the advanced cases may include muscle waste in the hands and fore arms , neck and shoulder , vocal cords , which leads to scoliosis and malfunction in chewing , swallowing , or speaking . The defective neurotransmission stems from either degradation of myelin sheath or breakdown of neuronal axon , which define primary forms of this disease , CMT type 1 and CMT type 2 respectively . CMT type 1 and CMT type 2 can be clinically distinguished based on nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) . Slow NCV ( less than 38 m / s ) is characteristic of demyelinating CMT type 1 , and the average NCV is slightly below normal , but above 38 m / s in CMT type 2 . In addition , dominant intermediate subtypes of CMT ( DI - CMT ) have been identified , which are characterized by NCVs overlapping both demyelinating and axonal range ( 25 - 45 m / s ) . Number of genes and gene loci has been involved in the pathogenesis of CMT , and despite of diversity of the responsible genes , they are involved in common molecular pathways within Schwann cells and axons that cause these genetic neuropathies ( Patzkó & Shy , 2011 ) . CMT Type 1 primarily affects the myelin sheath , and is inherited as dominant , recessive or X - linked . Type 2 primarily affects the axon , and is either dominant or recessive . DI - CMT is classified type A ( DI - CMTA ) , type B ( DI - CMTB ) type C ( DI - CMTC ) , and type D ( DI - CMTD ) according to responsible genes and gene loci . In this review , we focus on dynamin 2 and the mutations , which are responsible for DI - CMTB and axonal CMT type 2 . We explain physiological role of dynamin 2 in the regulation of microtubules and propose possible pathogenesis of CMT attributed to dynamin 2 mutants . 2 . Dyanmin2 mutation in CMT As described above , three types of dominantly inherited CMT with intermediate NCV DI - CMT ) are known . DI - CMTA was found in a large Italian family and it is linked to chromosome 10q24 . 1 - q25 . 1 ( Rossi et al . , 1985 ; Verhoeven et al . , 2001 ; Villanova et al . , 1998 ) , www . intechopen . com Peripheral Neuropathy – Advances in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches 4 but the responsible gene remains currently unknown . Two unrelated Midwestern - American and Bulgarian families with DI - CMT are linked to chromosome 1p34 - p35 , and it is classified as DI - CMTC ( Jordanova et al . , 2003b ) . In DI - CMTC , a mutation has been identified in tyrosyl - tRNA synthetase ( YARS ) ( Jordanova et al . , 2006 ) . Studies on DI - CMT in unrelated two large pedigrees originating from Australia and North America , has assigned the locus ( DI - CMTB ) to chromosome 19p12 – 13 . 2 . ( Kennerson et al . , 2001 ; Zhu et al . , 2003 ) . Successively , Züchner and coworkers refined the locus of the two DICMTB families and additional Belgian family , and identified mutations in dynamin 2 ( Züchner et al . , 2005 ) . The North - American family showed a 9 - bp deletion of the 3’ end of exon 14 of DNM2 , 1652 _ 1659 + 1delATGAGGAGg which is predicted to result in a shift of the open reading frame leading to a premature stop codon ( Lys550fs ) , and the production of an in - frame mRNA with predicted deletion of three amino acids ( Asp551 _ Glu553del ) . The Australian family and the Belgian family affect the same amino acid residue of dynamin 2 : Lys558 . The Australian family carried a missense mutation in exon 15 , 1672A → G , resulting in the amino acid substitution Lys558Glu . The Belgian family showed a deletion of a single amino acid , Lys558del ( 1672 _ 1674delAAG ) . Dynamin mutations in DI - CMTB identified in the original report were restricted in its PH domain ( Züchner et al . , 2005 , Fig . 2 ) . Subsequently , Claeys et al . , analyzed the three original families and in three additional unrelated Spanish , Belgian and Dutch families with DI - CMTB and found two novel mutations in dynamin 2 ( Claeys et al . , 2009 ) . They identified the novel missense mutation Gly358Arg ( 1072G4A ) in exon 7 of dynamin 2 in the Spanish family , and the novel Thr855 _ Ile856del ( 2564 _ 2569delCCATTA ) mutation in exon 19 in the index patient of the Belgian family . These mutations are situated in the middle domain and proline - rich domain of dynamin 2 , respectively ( Fig . 2 ) . Other mutations of dynamin 2 have been identified in CMT patients who present with symptoms typical of axonal CMT ( CMT2 ) ( Fabrizi et al . , 2007 ; Bitoun et al . , 2008 ) . The later study identified a heterozygous three base - pair deletion located in exon 15 of dynamin 2 ( 1675 _ 1677delAAA ) which results in the loss of the highly conserved lysine 559 ( Lys559del ) located in the PH domain ( Fig . 2 ) . 3 . Overview of dynamin Before mentioning possible pathogenesis of CMT caused by the mutation of dynamin 2 , the key molecule will be outlined here . In addition to the biochemical characteristics of the molecule , when and how the protein has been identified and studied , or what has been known so far regarding to its functions , will be described below . 3 . 1 Identification of dynamin Long before the discovery of mammalian dynamin , Drosophila melanogaster mutant shibire ( shi ts ) , a temperature - sensitive paralytic mutant , has been known ( Grigliatti et al . , 1973 ) Ultrastructural analysis of the neuromuscular junction of shi ts mutant fly revealed depletion of synaptic vesicles and accumulation of endocytic pits at presynaptic plasma membrane of neurons ( Kosaka & Ikeda , 1983 ) . Thus , the paralysis of shi ts mutant fly is caused by synaptic dysfunction due to blockage of synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Mammalian dynamin was originally isolated from bovine brain as a microtubule - binding protein ( Shpetner & Vallee , 1989 ) . Purified dynamin bound and interconnected microtubules , and supported microtubule gliding ( Shpetner & Vallee , 1989 , Fig . 1 ) . www . intechopen . com Etiological Role of Dynamin in Charcot – Marie – Tooth Disease 5 Fig . 1 . Electron micrograph of dynamin polymerizing around microtubules . Bundle of microtubules decorated with dynamin ( from Shpetner & Vallee , 1989 ) . Following the identification , dynamin was cloned and sequenced ( Obar et al . , 1990 ) . The amino acid sequence contained three consensus elements characteristic of GTP - binding proteins and suggested that it is a GTPase ( Obar et al . , 1990 ) . As suggested , dynamin was turned out to be a GTPase , which was highly stimulated by the presence of microtubules ( Shpetner & Vallee , 1992 ) . Later on , Drosophila shibire gene was cloned and sequenced ( Obar et al . , 1990 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1991 ) , which revealed considerably high homology of mammalian dynamin and shibire gene product ( 66 % identity , 78 % similarity ) . This revelation immediately put dynamin in the central stage of endocytosis research . In a short while , endocytosis was examined in COS and HeLa cells overexpressing mutant dynamin , and it was found that an endocytosis is blocked at an intermediate stage ( Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ) . 3 . 2 Dynamin Isoforms and their expression The mammalian brain dynamin was exclusively expressed in neurons ( Scaife & Margolis , 1990 ) , preferentially after postnatal day 7 ( Nakata et al . , 1991 ) . This neuron - specific isoform is termed dynamin 1 after two other isoforms with different tissue distributions were identified . Dynamin 2 is expressed ubiquitously ( Cook et al . , 1994 ) , and dynamin 3 is expressed highly in brain , testis , lung and heart ( Nakata et al . , 1993 ) . 3 . 3 Domain structure of dynamin Dynamin isoforms were highly homologous , and all the dynamin isoforms share five characteristic domains ( Fig . 2 ) . They include highly conserved N - terminal GTPase domain , middle domain that binds to  - tubulin ( Thompson et al . , 2004 ) , pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) that serves as binding motif for phophinositide - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( Barylko et al . , 1998 ) , and GTPase effector domain ( GED ) . C - terminal Proline / arginine - rich domain ( PRD ) considerably varies between dynamin isoforms , and mediates interaction with various SH3 - domains containing molecules , which include endocytic proteins amphiphysin 1 ( David et al . , 1996 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) , endophilin ( Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) , intersectin ( Zamanian et al . , 2003 ) , and sorting nexin 9 ( Ramachandran & Schmid , 2008 ) . Actin binding proteins , such as cortactin and Abp1 , also contain SH3 domain and bind to dynamin PRD ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ; Kessels et al . , 2001 ) . www . intechopen . com Peripheral Neuropathy – Advances in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches 6 Fig . 2 . Domain structure of dynamin and its mutation cites identified in CMT patients All dynamin isoforms contains five functional domains . Reported mutations found in CMT patients are shown . Among these , four mutations indicated in red are reported in the first study on dynamin mutation in CMT ( Züchner et al . , 2005 ) . Counterparts of dynamin’s binding motifs , PH and PRD , are also shown . GTPase : GTPase domain , middle : middle domain , PH : pleckstrin homology domain , GED : GTPase effector domain , PRD : Proline / arginine - rich domain , PIP 2 : phophinositide - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate . 3 . 4 Function of dynamin in endocytosis Dynamin self - assembles , or assembles with a binding partner molecule into rings and spirals in vitro ( Hinshaw & Schmid , 1995 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , in presence of lipodsomes , dynamin polymerizes on the lipid membranes and deform them into narrow tubules , and constricts the lipid tubules to fragments upon GTP - hydrolysis ( Sweitzer & Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1998 ; Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . This biophysical property of dynamin seems to support its role in the fission of endocytic pits in endocytosis . Physiologically , dynamin assembles into rings and spirals at the neck of deeply invaginated endocytic pits formed on the plasma membrane ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) , and conformation of the polymerized dynamin is changed upon GTP hydrolysis providing a driving force to squeeze the neck to membrane fission ( Sweitzer & Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1998 ; Marks et al . , 2001 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ; Ramachandran & Schmid , 2008 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . This mechanism of action of dynamin in endocytosis is referred as pinchase model ( McNiven , 1998 ) . Another model , in which conformational change of dynamin cause the extension of the dynamin spirals to pop off of the endocytic pit , is also proposed as popase model ( Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . In either case , dynamin functions as a GTPase - driven mechanoenzyme in endocytosis . www . intechopen . com Etiological Role of Dynamin in Charcot – Marie – Tooth Disease 7 Dynamin GTPase activity is stimulated by self - assembly ( Warnock et al . , 1996 ) , by PH domain - mediated interaction with membrane lipids such as PIP 2 ( Lin et al . , 1997 ) , or by PRD - mediated interaction with subset of SH3 domain - containing proteins ( Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) . This enzymatic characteristic of dynamin would be favorable for its function as a mechanochemical enzyme in endocytosis . Fig . 3 . Function of domain in endocytosis A : Dynamin assembles into rings at the neck of deeply invaginated endocytic pits formed on the plasma membrane . Conformational change of the polymerized dynamin upon GTP hydrolysis provides a driving force to squeeze the endocytic pit to membrane fission ( left ) . Experimentally inhibiting the GTP hydrolysis results in overpolymerization of dynamin around elongated endocytic pit ( middle ) . B : Electron micrograph of elongated endocytic pit decorated with dynamin ( arrowheads , from Takei et al . , 1995 ) Dynamin PRD interacts with various SH3 domain - containing endocytic proteins enriched in the synapse , including amphiphysin 1 ( David et al . , 1996 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) , endophilin ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , sorting nexin 9 ( Ramachandran & Schmid , 2008 ; Shin et al . , 2008 ) , syndapin ( Kessels et al . , 2004 ) , and intersectin ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ) . Such interactions may be utilized to incorporate various functional molecules synchronously required for endocytosis . For example , by interacting with amphiphysin or endophilin , BAR domain – containing endocytic proteins , BAR domain’s function of sensing or inducing membrane curvature would be synchronized with dynamin’s fission activity ( Yoshida et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . By interacting with Abp1 or cortactin , actin dynamics would take place at the site of endocytosis ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ) . Treatment with Latrunculin B , actin monomer - sequestering agent that blocks fast actin polymerization , results in the inhibition of fission reaction , supporting an implication of actin dynamics in endocytosis ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . www . intechopen . com Peripheral Neuropathy – Advances in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches 8 Dynamin 1 is phosphorylated by several kinases including PKC and CDK5 , and dephosphorylated by carcinerurin . Dynamin - dependent endocytosis is enhanced in presence of Roscovitine , CDK5 inhibitor , indicating that CDK5 - dependent phosphorylation of dynamin1 negatively regulates endocytosis . CDK5 phosphorylates not only dynmain1 but also amphiphsyin1 , its biding partner in endocytosis , and phosphorylation of these molecules decreases the binding affinity of these endocytic molecules ( Tomizawa et al . , 2003 ) . 3 . 5 Implication of dynamin in actin dynamics Involvement of dynamin in the regulation of actin dynamics is based largely on studies using dynamin 2 , a ubiquitous isoform . Dynamin 2 is enriched in variety of actin - rich structures , such as podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , invadopodia ( Baldassarre et al . , 2003 ) , lamellipodia and dorsal membrane ruffles ( Cao et al . , 1998 ; Krueger et al . , 2003 ; McNiven et al . , 2000 ) , phagocytic cups ( Gold et al . , 1999 ) , and Listeria actin comets ( Lee & De Camilli , 2002 ; Orth et al . , 2002 ) . Several studies suggest functional implication of dynamin GTPase in actin dynamics . Expression of dynamin K44A , a GTPase defective mutant , reduces the formation of actin comets ( Lee & De Camilli , 2002 ; Orth et al . , 2002 ) , podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ; Bruzzaniti et al . , 2005 ) , and drastically changes cell shape ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . Consistent with the localization and implication of dynamin in these actin - rich structures , molecular interactions of dynamin 2 with actin ( Gu et al . , 2010 ) and actin - regulating proteins such as Abp1 ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ) , profilin ( Witke et al . , 1998 ) and cortactin ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ; McNiven et al . , 2000 ) have been reported . Some studies emphasizes that these interactions represent mechanisms to incorporate actin dynamics in dynamin - dependent endocytosis . For example , interaction between dynamin 2 and cortactin , SH3 - domain containing actin binding protein that binds also F - actin and actin - regulating Arp2 / 3 complex ( Ammer & Weed , 2008 ) , is associated with clathrin and dynamin - dependent endocytosis ( Krueger et al . , 2003 ; Cao et al . , 2003 ; Zhu et al . , 2005 ) . On the other hand , however , the same dynamin - cortactin interaction is considered as a mechanism to recruit dynamin to the site of actin dynamics in other studies ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ; Schafer et al . , 2002 ; Mooren et al . , 2009 ; Yamada et al . , 2009 ) . Assembly and remodeling of actin filaments by dynamin 2 , through an interaction with cortactin , has been investigated by in vitro experiments ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ; Mooren et al . , 2009 ) . In their recent study , they demonstrated that , in the presence of dynamin , GTP led to remodeling of actin filaments in vitro via the actin - binding protein cortactin ( Mooren et al . , 2009 ) . As the mechanism of the actin regulation , they suggests that GTP hydrolysis - induced conformational change within dynamin is transduced to cortactin , which in turn alters orientation of the F - actin so that actin’s sensitivity to cofilin , an actin depolymerizing factor , is increased ( Mooren et al . , 2009 ) . However , as interactions between dynamin’s PRD and cortactin’s SH3 domain does not require GTP binding nor hydrolysis by dynamin , it remains uncertain how GTP hydrolysis dependent conformational change within dynamin might be transmitted to cortactin . More recently , direct interaction between dynamin and actin has been identified , and it was proposed that the interaction leads to release of gelsolin , an actin capping protein , from the actin filament ( Gu et al . , 2010 ) . However , it remains unclear how dynamin GTPase activity is utilized to alter the affinity of F - actin to the actin regulatory factor . www . intechopen . com Etiological Role of Dynamin in Charcot – Marie – Tooth Disease 9 4 . Implication of dynamin in microtubule dynamics As described above , dynamin 1 was originally identified as a microtubule - binding protein ( Shpetner & Vallee , 1989 ) , and its GTPase activity was stimulated by microtubules ( Shpetner & Vallee , 1989 ; Maeda et al . , 1992 ) . However , physiological significance of the dynamin - microtubule interaction has not been elucidated yet . The association between dynamin and microtubules was recently investigated in relation to mitosis , in which tubulin plays a role as in mitotic spindle and centrosome . In mitotic cells , dynamin 2 was concentrated at microtubule bundles at mitotic spindle ( Ishida et al . , 2011 ) , spindle midzone , and intercellular bridge in cytokinesis ( Thompson et al . , 2002 ) . The middle domain of dynamin 2 binds to  - tubulin , and they colocalize at the centrosome , where dynamin 2 is thought to play a role in centrosome cohesion ( Thompson et al . , 2004 ) . Consistent with such observation , dynamin is enriched in spindle midbody extracts ( Thompson et al . , 2002 ) . 4 . 1 Dynamin CMT mutant 551  3 impairs microtubule dynamics Dynamin’s role of on microtubules at interphase was incidentally revealed as a result of our recent investigation on dynamin mutations found in CMT patents ( Tanabe & Takei 2009 ) . In order to elucidate molecular pathogenesis of dynamin 2 - cused CMT disease , we overexpressed dynamin CMT mutants , 551  3 and K558E , in COS - 7 cells , and examined the dynamin’s role on microtubules . Endocytosis , which was assessed by transferrin uptake , was completely blocked by K558E as reported before ( Züchner et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , 551  3 did not block endocytosis , but the transferrin - containing early and recycling endosomes no longer accumulated at the perinuclear region suggesting dysfunction of microtubule - dependent vesicular transport in dynamin 2 - caused CMT ( Fig . 4 ) . Fig . 4 . Endocytosis of transferrin in dynamin 2 mutant expressing cells . COS - 7 cells transfected with the indicated constructs were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 – transferrin for 30 min , and exogenous dynamin was stained by immunofluorescence ( red ) . Note that transferrin ( green ) is internalized in 551 Δ 3 expressing cells , but the transferrin is not accumulated at perinuclear region ( second panel from the left ) in contrast to dynamin WT expressing cells ( left ) . Endocytosis is blocked in dynamin K44A and K558E expressing cells ( right two panels ) . ( from Tanabe & Takei , 2009 ) www . intechopen . com Peripheral Neuropathy – Advances in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches 10 As mentioned above , dynamin was originally identified as a microtubule - associated protein ( Shpetner & Vallee , 1989 ) . Both dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 polymerizes around microtubules , and the interactions lead to the stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity ( Maeda et al . , 1992 ; Warnock et al . , 1997 ) . Consistently , in cells , subpopulation of dynamin 2 is present at microtubules in addition to the plasma membrane and cytosol . Localization of dynamin at microtubules become more prominent in 551  3 expressing cells ( Züchner et al . , 2005 ; Tanabe & Takei , 2009 ) , probably because of its increased affinity to microtubules . Microtubules can be very stable or highly dynamic depending on the cell cycle stage , and on position of the cell within the organism ( Schulze & Kirschner , 1987 ) . Microtubule typically comprises 13 protofilaments , which are consisted of  tubulin heterodimers . The tubulin dimers can depolymerize as well as polymerize , and microtubules can undergo rapid cycles of assembly and disassembly . GTP - bound tubulin is added onto plus - tips of microtubules and hydrolysis of GTP induces conformational change in tubulin dimer , which induces microtubule depolymerization . This dynamic instability of microtubules is regulated by many factors ( Howard & Hyman , 2007 ) .  Stable microtubules are subject to acetylation ( Piperno et al . , 1987 ; Westermann & Weber , 2003 ) , thus they can be distinguished from dynamic microtubules by measuring acetylated tubulin . Acetylated tubulin was massively increased in 551  3 expressing cells compared to WT dynamin ( Fig . 5 ) , in spite of the protein expression levels were unchanged , indicating that the 551  3 mutation of dynamin 2 impairs dynamic instability of microtubules . Fig . 5 . Expression of 551 Δ 3 dynamin 2 mutant causes accumulation of acetylated tubulin . COS - 7 cells were transfected with the indicated dynamin constructs and visualized by immunofluorescence for exogenous dynamin ( red ) and acetylated tubulin ( green ) . Note the accumulation of abundant acetylated tubulin in 551 Δ 3 expressing cells ( middle ) . ( from Tanabe & Takei , 2009 ) Impaired dynamic instability of microtubules is known to inhibit intracellular trafficking along microtubules ( Mimori - Kiyosue & Tsukita , 2003 ; Vaughan , 2005 ) . Microtubule - dependent traffic can be analyzed by examining the formation of the Golgi apparatus because the biogenesis involves transport process of pre - Golgi compartment from cell periphery to perinuclear region , and this transport is dependent on microtubules ( Thyberg & Moskalewski , 1999 ) ( Fig . 6 ) . While mature Golgi apparatus is ribbon - shaped localized at perinuclear region , immature pre - Golgi compartments are scattered throughout the cytoplasm . Golgi apparatus in the 551  3 expressing cells were massively fragmented , representing impaired microtubule - dependent vesicular traffic in the cells ( Fig . 7 ) . This is consistent with impaired dynamic instability of microtubules in 551  3 expressing cells . www . intechopen . com Etiological Role of Dynamin in Charcot – Marie – Tooth Disease 11 Fig . 6 .

Lower panels : Dynamin 2 RNAi causes fragmentation of Golgi apparatus ( right ) . HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and visualized with antibodies a Golgi marker GRASP65 ( green ) and α - tubulin ( red ) . ( from Tanabe & Takei , 2009 ) www . intechopen . com Peripheral Neuropathy – Advances in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches 12 4 . 2 Depletion of dynamin affects microtubule dynamics Accumulation of acetylated microtubules and impairment of microtubule - dependent vesicular traffic induced by the 551  3 mutation are thought to be due to ‘loss of function’ of dynamin 2 , because depletion of endogenous dynamin 2 in HeLa cells by RNAi resulted in similar phenotypes ( Tanabe & Takei , 2009 ) . Golgi apparatus was fragmented in approximately 90 % of dynamin 2 siRNA cells , indicating suppressed microtubule - dependent membrane transport . The dynamin 2 siRNA - treated cells did not show any apparent reorganization of microtubules by immunofluorescence . However , acetylated tubulin in the cells was increased approximately twofold while total tubulin protein level remain unchanged . In addition , EB1 , which localizes at the plus - end of dynamic / growing microtubules , was significantly reduced in dynamin 2 siRNA cells , even though the EB1 expression levels were unaffected by the siRNA ( Fig . 8 ) . This indicates that depletion of endogenous dynamin 2 reduces dynamic , growing microtubules . 5 . Possible mechanism of the regulation of microtubule dynamics by dynamin As described above , dynamin 2 is implicated in the dynamic instability of microtubules , and deletion or mutation of the protein impairs the microtubule dynamics . Then how dynamin regulates the microtubule dynamics ? Microtubule is regulated , both in polymerization and depolymerization , by many factors . While microtubule depolymerizing factors involve MCAK , a member of kinesin - 13 family ( Hunter ey al . , 2003 ; Walczak , 2003 ) , polymerization factors includes XMAP215 , tau and doublecortin ( Howard & Hyman , 2007 ; Kerssemakers et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , the microtubule plus - end proteins , including EB1 , CLASPs and CLIP170 , are also essential for dynamic instability of microtubules . It would be possible that activity of these microtubule - regulating molecules is altered by the presence of dynamin on microtubules . In another words , microtubule - bound dynamin 2 might function as “ratchet” that limits the access of these molecules to microtubules . Physiologically , dynamin transiently interact with microtubules , resulting only small population of dynamin stays at “microtubule - bound” state . On the other hand , dynamin with CMT mutation has higher affinity to microtubules and preferably localizes at microtubules ( Tanabe & Takei , 2009 ) . This would lessen the access of microtubule - regulating molecules to microtubules , and as a result , causes to decrease polymerization - depolymerization cycle . It would be also possible that abundant presence of mutant dynamin on microtubules may mechanically obstruct polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules ( Fig 9 ) . It is known that blocking interconversion between stable and dynamic microtubules using Taxol , a microtubule depolymerization inhibitor , results in abnormal rearrangement of microtubules ( Green & Goldman , 1983 ) . Consistently , abnormal accumulation of acetylated microtubules is observed in dynamin 551  3 expressing cells ( Tanabe & Takei , 2009 ) . Live cell imaging of GFP tubulin stably expressed in HeLa cells revealed that dynamic instability of microtubules in dynamin 2 - depleted cells was apparently decreased compared with control cells ( Tanabe & Takei , 2009 ) . www . intechopen . com Etiological Role of Dynamin in Charcot – Marie – Tooth Disease 13 Fig . 8 . Depletion of endogenous dynamin 2 by RNAi results in stable microtubule accumulation . HeLa cells cells transfected with control or dynamin 2 siRNA were stained by immunofluorescence as indicated . Note the increase of acetylated tubulin in dynamin 2 knocked - down cells ( middle panels ) while total tubulin is unchanged ( top panels ) . In the knocked - down cells , punctate staining of EB1 , microtubules plus end factor is lost ( bottom panels ) . ( from Tanabe & Takei , 2009 ) www . intechopen . com Peripheral Neuropathy – Advances in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches 14 Fig . 9 . Possible role of dynamin in the regulation of microtubule dynamics . Transient interaction of dynamin with microtubules would be essential for dynamic instability of microtubules ( left ) . Mutation of dynamin would increase dynamin’s affinity of to microtubules , which in turn obstructs polymerization - depolymerization cycle of microtubules either mechanically , or indirectly via microtubule - regulating molecules . 6 . Conclusion Dynamin has been originally identified as a microtubule - binding protein in 1989 . However , the most of dynamin studies in the last two decades has been focused on its functions in endocytosis and actin dynamics . Our recent investigation on CMT mutant dynamin revealed impairment of microtubule dynamics and microtubule - dependent transport . Furthermore , this study led to the discovery of a novel role of dynamin , i . e . regulation of dynamic instability of microtubules . It remains to be clarified which cells are more affected in the dynamin - caused CMT , in a correlation with clinical features of the disease . Since dynamin 2 is a ubiquitously expressed isoform , CMT mutations in dynamin 2 could affect either neurons , Schwan cells , or both . Precise molecular mechanism how dynamin regulates dynamic instability of microtubules would require future studies . Especially , it would be of importance which molecules function with dynamin in the microtubule regulation , or how dynamin - microtubule interaction is regulated . 7 . References Ammer , A .

We have refined our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis for both peripheral and central nervous system diseases , and developed new therapeutic approaches towards these diseases . Peripheral neuropathy is a common disorder seen by many specialists and can pose a diagnostic dilemma . Many etiologies , including drugs that are used to treat other diseases , can cause peripheral neuropathy . However , the most common cause is Diabetes Mellitus , a disease all physicians encounter . Disability due to peripheral neuropathy can be severe , as the patients suffer from symptoms daily . This book addresses the advances in the diagnosis and therapies of peripheral neuropathy over the last decade . The basics of different peripheral neuropathies is briefly discussed , however , the book focuses on topics that address new approaches to peripheral neuropathies .
