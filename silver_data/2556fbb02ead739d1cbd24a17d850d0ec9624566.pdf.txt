E . Van Montagu , October 29 , 2010 ( sent for review September 28 , 2010 ) Endocytosis is crucial for various cellular functions and development of multicellular organisms . In mammals and yeast , ADP - ribosylation factor ( ARF ) GTPases , key components of vesicle formation , and their regulators ARF - guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and ARF - GTPase - activating protein ( GAPs ) mediate endocytosis . A similarrolehasnotbeenestablishedinplants , mainlybecauseofthe lackofthecanonicalARFandARF - GEFcomponentsthatareinvolved in endocytosis in other eukaryotes . In this study , we revealed a regulatorymechanismofendocytosisinplantsbasedonARFGTPaseactivity . Weidenti ﬁ edthatARF - GEFGNOMandARF - GAPVASCULAR NETWORK DEFECTIVE 3 ( VAN3 ) , both of which are involved in polar auxin transport - dependent morphogenesis , localize at the plasma membranes as well as in intracellular structures . Variable angle epi - ﬂ uorescence microscopy revealed that GNOM and VAN3 localize to partiallyoverlapping discretefoci attheplasmamembranesthatare regularly associated with the endocytic vesicle coat clathrin . Genetic studies revealed that GNOM and VAN3 activities are required for endocytosis and internalization of plasma membrane proteins , in - cluding PIN - FORMED auxin transporters . These ﬁ ndings identi ﬁ ed ARF GTPase - based regulatory mechanisms for endocytosis in plants . GNOM and VAN3 previously were proposed to function solely at the recyclingendosomesand trans - Golgi networks , respectively . There - fore our ﬁ ndings uncovered an additional cellular function of these prominent developmental regulators . vesicle traf ﬁ cking | plant development | polarity T he ADP - ribosylation factor ( ARF ) GTPase machinery is the regulatory system that controls endocytosis in metazoans and fungi . The ARF GTPases govern vesicle budding , and their ac - tivity is regulated spatiotemporally by ARF - guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and ARF - GTPase - activating protein ( GAPs ) . ARF - GEFs facilitate the exchange of bound GDP for GTP for ARF GTPase , whereas ARF - GAPs stimulate the GTP hydrolysis activity of ARF GTPase to counteract the ARF - GEF activity that , in turn , facilitates the ARF GTPase cycle ( 1 ) . In met - azoans and fungi , ARF - GEFs and ARF - GAPs consist of various groups , and speci ﬁ c ARF - GEFs and ARF - GAPs are used to control the ARF GTPase at the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( 2 ) . For instance , large - sized Golgi - speci ﬁ c Brefeldin A resistance factor ( GBF ) - type ARF - GEFs are involved in endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) - to - Golgi traf ﬁ cking , and small - and medium - sized ARF - GEFs that contain the pleckstrin homology domain are involved in endocytosis ( Fig . S1 A and B ) ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) . However , in the plant genomes , the small - and medium - sized ARF - GEFs are absent ( Fig . S1 A and B ) ( 3 ) . These differences suggested that the regulatory mechanism of endocytosis in plants has evolved differently from that in other eukaryotes . In general , plants share components of the ARF GTPase ma - chinery . The functional characterization of several Arabidopsis thaliana ARF - GEFs and ARF - GAPs has revealed their crucial roles in plant development . The ARF - GEF GNOM that belongs to the large - sized GBF type of ARF - GEFs is essential for plant development , particularly for processes such as embryo and seedling patterning ( 5 , 6 ) that depend on the transport of the plant hormone auxin , and has been shown to regulate the recy - cling of PIN - FORMED ( PIN ) auxin transporters from the endosomes to the PM ( 7 , 8 ) . Similarly , the ARF - GAP VASCU - LAR NETWORK DEFECTIVE 3 ( VAN3 ) controls auxin trans - port - mediated processes such as vascular tissue formation ( 9 , 10 ) , and its cellular role , although not entirely clear , has been mapped to the endosomal compartments ( 9 , 11 ) . In contrast to the ex - tensive data in yeast and mammals ( 4 , 12 , 13 ) , very little is known about the direct involvement of the ARF machinery in the en - docytosis of plants ( 14 – 16 ) . It has been suggested that the GNOM - like 1 ( GNL1 ) ARF - GEF , the closest homolog of GNOM , regulates the internalization of the PIN2 auxin trans - porter ( 17 ) , but its action remained unclear because the loss - of - function gnl1 mutants did not show any endocytosis defects per se ( 18 ) . The absence of canonical endocytic ARF components in plant genomes as well as the lack of any data demonstrating the presence of ARF GEFs and ARF GAPs at the PM of plant cells raises a question about how endocytosis regulation is realized in plants . Results and Discussion van3 Mutants Phenocopy gnom Mutants . To examine the functions of plant ARF GTPases and their regulators , we studied the de - velopmental and cellular roles of ARF - GEF GNOM and ARF - GAP VAN3 . VAN3 / SCARFACE ( SFC ) and its three homologs , theVAN3 - like ( VAL ) proteins , redundantlyregulatetheformation of vasculature , whereas val1val2val3 triple mutants did not show remarkablephenotypes ( 10 ) . Wefurtheranalyzedthe development ofplantslackingthefunctionofVAN3andrelatedproteins . Besides the venation discontinuity ( Fig . S1 C – F ) , sfc - 9val1val2val3 mutants had fused lateral root primordia ( 33 . 1 % , n = 124 ) and defective cotyledonformation ( 4 . 1 % , n = 763 ) ( Fig . 1 A – C ) . Thewhole range of developmental defects were strongly reminiscent of those found in weak gnom mutant alleles that are defective in GNOM ARF - GEF ( 19 ) . The phenotypic similarity and the common biochemical function in regulating ARF GTPases suggest a functional relation between VAN3 and GNOM in the same process . VAN3 ARF - GAP and GNOM ARF - GEF Are Localized at the PM . To assess whether VAN3 and GNOM can act together in the cell , we ex - amined their subcellular distribution .

In con - trast , in developing organs , such as root meristems , embryos , and lateral root primordia , the functional VAN3 - GFP , which was expressed in the van3 mutant and complemented its phenotype , localized preferentially at the PM , in addition to the minor in - tracellular dot - like signals ( Fig . 2 A - C ) . Because GNOM functions at recycling endosomes ( 7 ) , VAN3 and GNOM might act intracellularly at the same endosomes . To explore this possibility , we examined the localization of the func - tional GNOM - GFP and VAN3 - monomeric red ﬂ uorescent pro - tein ( mRFP ) expressed in the embryo - defective30 - 1 and sfc - 9 mutants , respectively . However , simultaneous localization of VAN3 - mRFP and GNOM - GFP proteins revealed no intracellular colocalization ( Fig . 2 D – F ) . Unexpectedly , careful observation identi ﬁ ed a weak , but regular , localization of the functional GNOM - GFP at the PM of different cell types ( 12 . 2 ± 3 . 3 % of seedlings , n = 83 ) ( Fig . 2 D and Table S1 ) . ARF - GEFs are known to dissociate rapidly from the membrane after their action ( 20 , 21 ) , and this rapid dissociation typically hampers the observation of ARF GEFs , including GNOM , at their place of action . To address further the presence and action of GNOM at the PM , we applied the ARF - GEF inhibitor brefeldin A ( BFA ) that is known to sta - bilize BFA - sensitive ARF - GEFs at the membranes where they act ( 22 ) . In Arabidopsis , BFA treatment mediates GNOM accumula - tion at recycling endosomes and their aggregation with the TGN to form “ BFA bodies ” ( 23 ) where various PM proteins accumulate Fig . 1 .

Notably , after the BFA treatment , strong GNOM - GFP labeling was observed not only in BFA bodies but also at the PM ( 100 ± 0 % of seedlings , n = 68 ) ( Fig . 2 G and Table S1 ) , as can be seen in the previously published micrographs ( 7 ) . Similarly , VAN3 - mRFP was still present at the PMs after BFA treatment ( Fig . 2 H – I ) . To compare the incidence of GNOM at the PM and in the BFA bodies and to exclude potential secondary effects , we examined the GNOM - GFP localization at different time points and concentrations of BFA treatment . To observe better the effect of BFA on the GNOM - GFP localization , we excited GNOM - GFP at low laser power that could not detect the clear PM - localized GNOM - GFP before the BFA treatment . Live - cell imaging of GNOM - GFP after BFA application revealed that GNOM - GFP associated strongly with the PM at the same time as or even before the for - mation of BFA bodies ( Fig . S2 A ) . Moreover , at low BFA concen - trations , the BFA bodies were not visibly formed , but GNOM - GFP showed a strong decoration of the PM ( Fig . S2 B ) . Importantly , the engineered , BFA - resistant version of GNOM - MYC ( 7 ) was not stabilized at the PM after BFA treatment ( Fig . S2 C and D and Table S1 ) . These results con ﬁ rm the localization of GNOM to - gether with VAN3 at the PM . Moreover , the stabilization of GNOM at the PM after the BFA treatment implies that this lo - calization has functional signi ﬁ cance and that the ARF machinery acts at the PM . Theseresults suggest that VAN3 and GNOMdo not colocalize in the intracellular endomembranes but localize together at the PM and that they have a common function there . GNOM ARF - GEF and VAN3 ARF - GAP Are Partially Colocalized and Recruited to Clathrin Foci at the Cell Surface . To gain further in - formation on the action of the GNOM ARF - GEF and VAN3 ARF - GAP at the PMs , we performed variable angle epi ﬂ uor - escence microscopy ( VAEM ) analysis that enables the selec - tivevisualizationofcellsurfaces ( 25 , 26 ) . GNOM - GFPandVAN3 - mRFP were organized prominently into discrete foci at the cell periphery . Foci of GNOM - GFP and VAN3 - mRFP partially over - lapped , althoughsomeindependentfociwere present ( Fig . 3 A – C ) . Approximately40 % ofallVAN3 - mRFPfoci ( n = 304 ) overlapped with the GNOM - GFP foci , whereas ≈ 40 % of all of the GNOM - GFP foci ( n = 309 ) overlapped with the VAN3 - mRFP foci ( Fig . 3 J ) . To exclude the possibility that the colocalization was the result of random overlapping of the foci in the cell cortex of epidermal cells , we applied a previously used technique ( 27 , 28 ) in which , as a negative control , the colocalization rate was counted by rotating the red channel image with respect to the green channel image by 180° . The average colocalization rate of GNOM and VAN3 was much higher than that of the rotated images , indicating that their colocalization was highly signi ﬁ cant ( Fig . 3 J ) . Thus , GNOM and VAN3 partially colocalize , implying a functional relationship be - tween VAN3 and GNOM and suggesting that GNOM and VAN3 have both overlapping and distinct functions at the PMs . VAEM may detect signals that are in close proximity to the PM as well as signals at the PM itself . To con ﬁ rm that GNOM and VAN3 foci localized to PMs , we compared the localizations of GNOM and VAN3 with clathrin , which is localized to the PM to mediate endocytosis ( 29 ) . We used the lines overexpressing the ﬂ uorescently labeled clathrin light chain ( CLC ) , which is used as a marker of endocytosis site at the PMs ( 26 , 29 – 31 ) .

Kusabira Orange ( mKO ) - tagged CLC revealed that GNOM - GFP and VAN3 - GFP foci were observed in the same focal plane as CLC - mKO and that some GNOM - GFP and VAN3 - GFP foci colocalized with mKO - CLC ( Fig . 3 D – I , K , and L ) . These ﬁ ndings indicate that GNOM and VAN3 are located on the PMs , where some of them associated with the clathrin foci , further suggesting that these ARF regulators function in endocytosis . GNOM and VAN3 Are Required for Endocytosis . Subcellular locali - zation analysis of VAN3 and GNOM suggested that they play a role in endocytosis . To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the uptake of the endocytic tracer N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( 6 - ( 4 - ( diethylamino ) phenyl ) hexatrienyl ) pyridinium dibromide ( FM4 - 64 ) ( 32 – 35 ) in van3 and gnom mutants . Pulse - labeling and time - lapse monitoring of the intracellular ﬂ uorescence revealed that FM4 - 64 uptake was clearly lower in van3 - 1 and van7 ( weak alleles of gnom ) roots than in the wild type ( Fig . 4 A – C and G ) . A similar reduction of the FM4 - 64 uptake was also detected in other van3 and gnom alleles , including gnom R5 , sfc - 9 , and sfc - 9val1 - val2val3 ( Fig . S3 A – H ) . Next , we tested the involvement of VAN3 and GNOM in the internalization of proteins from the PM . To visualize the protein internalization , we applied BFA and monitored the intracellular accumulation of the endocytosed PIN1 auxin transporter ( 8 ) . BFA prominently inhibits the recycling pathway rather than the endocytosis pathway , so that the ratio between endocytosis and recycling is perturbed and the endocytosis material accumulates intracellularly ( 7 ) . To exclude any in ﬂ uence of de novo protein synthesis , we coincubated samples with the protein synthesis in - hibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) . In both the presence and absence of CHX , PIN1 - GFP internalization and intracellular accumula - tion were strongly reduced in sfc - 9 and gnom R5 mutants when compared with wild - type roots ( Fig . 4 D – F and Fig . S4 A ) . Simi - larly , anti - PIN1 antibody staining revealed a diminished PIN1 internalization in roots of van7 and sfc - 9val1val2val3 roots ( Figs . S3 I and J and S4 B ) . These results suggested that the endocytosis - to - recycling ratio was smaller in the van3 and gnom mutants than in the wild type . Because the BFA compartments in wild - type cells contain en - docytosis material from the PM ( 29 ) , endocytosis appears to be Fig . 4 . VAN3 and GNOM involvement in endocytosis .

Time points after the FM4 - 64 pulse are indicated . ( Scale bars in A – I : 4 μ m . ) Naramoto et al . PNAS | December 14 , 2010 | vol . 107 | no . 50 | 21893 P L A N T B I O L O G Y largely operational under the inhibition of the GNOM - dependent traf ﬁ cking by BFA ( Fig . 4 D ) , suggesting that BFA - resistant ARF - GEF are involved in endocytosis . Because GNL1 , a BFA - resistant ARF - GEF , had been shown to act redundantly with GNOM in the ER - to - Golgi traf ﬁ cking ( 36 ) , we examined whether BFA - resistant GNL1 also might function redundantly with GNOM in endocytosis . The FM4 - 64 uptake analysis did not reveal any en - docytosis defects in BFA - untreated gnl1 mutant roots ( Fig . S3 K and L ) , consistent with previous observations ( 18 ) ; in contrast , the BFA treatment caused PIN1 internalization defects in the gnl1 mutants ( Figs . S3 M and N and S4 C ) ( 17 ) . Possible redundant function between BFA - sensitive GNOM and BFA - resistant GNL1 made it dif ﬁ cult to dissect their role in endocytosis after the BFA treatment . ARF - GEF sensitivity or resistance to BFA can be changed by introducing a mutation that affects the sensitivity to BFA but not the overall protein function ( 37 ) , providing a means to manipulate speci ﬁ cally the function of a selected ARF GEF ( 36 ) . To clarify this apparent discrepancy and assess a GNOM function in endocytosis , we used the engineered versions of GNOM and GNL1 with changed BFA sensitivities ( 7 , 36 ) . We used the background of the BFA - sensitive version of GNL1 to inhibit the GNL1 function by BFA treatment and manipulate only the GNOM function . In the background of the BFA - sensitive GNL1 , the BFA - sensitive GNOM reduced the BFA - induced PIN1 internalization in contrast to the BFA - resistant GNOM ( Figs . S3 O and P and S4 D ) . Similarly , the FM4 - 64 ﬂ uorescence from the PM disappeared more slowly in the presence of BFA when GNOM was BFA sensitive than when it was BFA resistant ( Fig . 4 H and I and Fig . S3 Q and R ) . Together with the ﬁ ndings on FM4 - 64 uptake defects in un - treated gnom mutants but not gnl1 mutants ( Fig . 4 C and Fig . S3 L ) ( 18 ) , these results show that it is primarily GNOM that is required for endocytosis , both in the presence and absence of the GNL1 function . On the other hand , in the absence of the GNOM function ( BFA treatment of the wild type ) , GNL1 , which is re - sistant to BFA , partially takes over the function of GNOM in endocytosis , because there are additional internalization defects in the BFA - treated gnl1 mutants ( 17 ) resulting from the inhibition of both GNOM and GNL1 function at the PM . Thus , both GNOM and GNL1 are required for endocytosis , with GNOM being the major factor in this process . Conclusions Here we identi ﬁ ed an additional function of ARF - GEF GNOM and ARF - GAP VAN3 in endocytosis at the PMs , besides their function at intracellular organelles ( 5 , 9 ) . The phenotypic simi - larity between the multiple van3 mutants and the weak allele of the gnom mutants prompted us to examine the functional relationship between GNOM and VAN3 . Surprisingly , these regulators did not colocalize in the intracellular compartments but localized together to the PM . VAEM analysis con ﬁ rmed that a large portion of GNOM - GFP and VAN3 - mRFP foci were located in the same place at the PM and colocalized regularly with clathrin foci . Im - portantly , genetic inhibition of the GNOM or VAN3 functions leads to defects in endocytosis . So far , the focus had been put on the intracellular localization and function of GNOM and VAN3 , but their role in endocytosis had not been proposed ( 7 , 9 ) . Nonetheless , our results reveal both the presence of these regu - lators at the PM and the requirement of their function for endo - cytosis . These ﬁ ndings , in particular , in the case of the GNOM function , are unexpected and , to some extent , contradict previous interpretations ( 7 ) but are not inconsistent with previously re - ported data . Linear sucrose - density gradient centrifugation de - tected the GNOM protein in the PM fractions as well as in other membrane fractions , although the GNOM action at the PMs had never been mentioned ( 6 ) . Furthermore , re - evaluation of previous localization studies also revealed a faint , but consistent , localiza - tion of GNOM at the PM ( 7 , 38 ) . Finally , expression of GTP - and GDP - ﬁ xed forms of ARF1 inhibits endocytic FM4 - 64 uptake ( 39 ) , also suggesting the involvement of the ARF GTPase machinery in endocytosis . Our work clari ﬁ es the apparent previous incon - sistencies , provides additional insights into the role of GNOM ARF - GEF and VAN3 ARF - GAP , and rede ﬁ nes the cellular function of these two important developmental regulators . Our ﬁ ndings also have important implications for the evolution of the membrane - traf ﬁ cking machineries in plants . We show that the ancestral GBF - type ARF - GEFs are used for regulating en - docytosis in Arabidopsis , although in fungi and metazoans they are speci ﬁ cally involved in the ER - to - Golgi traf ﬁ c ( 2 ) . Because plants lack the class III ARFs that act at the PM in mammals ( 2 , 40 ) , it would be interesting to analyze which ARF proteins are used to regulate endocytosis in plant cells . Our work suggests that the recruitment of ARF - GEF regulators for various ARF GTPase functions also differs from that in metazoans and fungi . These ﬁ ndings point out important differences in the mechanism of ARF - dependent endocytosis between plants and other eukary - otes and also open avenues for investigating the independent coevolution of ARF - based vesicle traf ﬁ cking machineries in different eukaryotes .

The mean ﬂ uorescence intensity of vesicles inside the cells , excluding the PM , was measured with ImageJ ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . The quotients between the inside and the PM value were cal - culated for 10 – 15 cells from at least three different roots . The values of three independent experiments were averaged . The value of each phenotype was standardized to the corresponding wild - type control to evaluate the per - centage of endocytosis inhibition compared with a wild - type condition . 21894 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1016260107 Naramoto et al .
