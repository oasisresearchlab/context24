A R T I C L E S During embryonic development , neurons are guided to specific targets by extracellular cues in their environment . Axon growth cones sense various chemoattractive and chemorepulsive signals and translate these signals , via intracellular signal transduction pathways , into cellu - lar movements that ultimately steer them to their correct targets . Several axon guidance molecules have been discovered and character - ized , including a soluble family of proteins called netrins 1 – 3 . Netrins can stimulate axon growth in addition to eliciting both attractive and repulsive responses 4 . Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that UNC - 40 and UNC - 5 are functional receptors for UNC - 6 , a netrin homolog 5 – 7 . The mammalian homolog of UNC - 40 is DCC , originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene 8 . DCC mediates both the axon growth and the chemoattractive function of netrin 6 , 7 , 9 . In addition , DCC medi - ates growth cone repulsion when in a complex with the UNC - 5 recep - tor 5 , 10 – 13 . The UNC - 40 and UNC - 5 receptor complex is required for the dorsoventral repulsion of both neurons and gonads in C . elegans . The biological functions of netrin and its receptors in axon growth and growth cone guidance have been well studied ; the intracellular signal transduction pathways downstream of the netrin receptors , however , are only partially understood . Tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved downstream of guidance receptors , as phosphorylation of both DCC and UNC - 5 has been observed 14 . Furthermore , coexpression of Src , a tyrosine kinase , increases UNC - 5 tyrosine phosphorylation , indicating a possible role of Src in netrin signaling . FAK is activated by integrins and other extra - cellular signals . FAK activation stimulates multiple cellular signal trans - duction events leading to cell adhesion , motility and cell morphological changes 15 – 17 . In response to integrin stimulation , FAK binds to Src and stimulates Src activity . Both the scaffold functions and kinase activity of FAK contribute to integrin - induced signal transduction . Src , in turn , phosphorylates and activates FAK . Therefore , FAK and Src act synergis - tically to signal downstream targets . Interestingly , the Src family tyro - sine kinases ( SFKs ) are highly enriched in the nervous system and may be involved in the signal transduction of axon guidance receptors 18 , 19 . In this report , we show that netrin activates FAK and Src and stim - ulates tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC . The carboxy ( C ) - terminal domain of FAK interacts with the C - terminal P3 domain of DCC , and this FAK - DCC interaction is required for netrin to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of FAK . Furthermore , netrin - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC and FAK requires SFKs . We also found that DCC interacts with Src and that inhibition of SFKs by PP2 blocks netrin - stimulated axon growth of commissural neurons from embryonic rat spinal explants . Alteration of Src function using inhibitors or by overexpression of Src mutants blocked the netrin - induced axon attraction of Xenopus laevis spinal neurons . In addition , the importance of DCC tyrosine phosphoryla - tion in netrin signaling was also demonstrated by the axon attraction assay , indicating that DCC is a key downstream substrate of FAK - Src in the DCC receptor complex . Our data demonstrate that FAK and SFKs act immediately downstream of the netrin receptor DCC and are importantly involved in netrin - induced signal transduction . 1 Life Sciences Institute and 2 Department of Biological Chemistry , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan 48109 , USA . 3 Department of Biochemistry , New York University School of Medicine , New York , New York 10016 , USA . 4 Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology , Washington University School of Medicine , St .

DCC ( deleted in colorectal cancer ) is a functional receptor for netrin and mediates axon outgrowth and the steering response . Here we show that different regions of the intracellular domain of DCC directly interacted with the tyrosine kinases Src and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) . Netrin activated both FAK and Src and stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC . Inhibition of Src family kinases reduced DCC tyrosine phosphorylation and blocked both axon attraction and outgrowth of neurons in response to netrin . Mutation of the tyrosine phosphorylation residue in DCC abolished its function of mediating netrin - induced axon attraction . On the basis of our observations , we suggest a model in which DCC functions as a kinase - coupled receptor , and FAK and Src act immediately downstream of DCC in netrin signaling .

Furthermore , preincuba - tion of the cultured neurons with an extracel - lular antibody to DCC ( anti - DCC ) blocked the netrin - stimulated FAK tyrosine phospho - rylation by approximately 70 % ( Fig . 1b ) . These observations demonstrate that netrin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of endoge - nous DCC and FAK . FAK and DCC associate with each other To examine the function of FAK in DCC tyrosine phosphorylation , we cotransfected DCC and FAK into HEK293 cells . FAK coex - pression increased DCC tyrosine phospho - rylation ( Fig . 1c ) . Importantly , tyrosine phosphorylation of both DCC and FAK were enhanced by netrin . We also observed that netrin stimulated DCC tyrosine phosphory - lation in a dosage - and time - dependent manner , with an effective concentration sim - ilar to that reported to induce axon out - growth 2 ( see Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) . Notably , our phosphotyrosine western blot detected a DCC - coprecipitated band with a molecular weight similar to FAK ( Fig . 1c ) , indicating that DCC may associate with FAK . We directly tested the interaction between DCC and FAK by coimmunopre - cipitation ( co - IP ) of overexpressed proteins in HEK293 cells . We found that DCC was specifically immunoprecipitated by FAK ( Fig . 1d ) . Reciprocal co - IP also confirmed that FAK was recovered in anti - DCC immunoprecipitates ( Fig . 1d ) . We estimated that approximately 2 – 5 % of the transfected DCC was coimmunoprecipitated with FAK . The interaction between DCC and FAK was confirmed by in vitro pulldown experiments ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . To confirm the interaction between DCC and FAK under physiological conditions , we carried out co - IP studies from mouse brain tissue . DCC was detected in the anti - FAK immunoprecipi - tates , but not in the negative control ( Fig . 1e ) . These data demonstrate that DCC and FAK can form a complex under physio - logical conditions . We examined which region of FAK is responsible for the interaction with DCC . Deletion experiments indicated that the C - terminal domain of FAK is necessary and sufficient to mediate interaction with DCC ( Fig . 1f ) . A naturally existing alternatively spliced form of FAK called FRNK ( FAK - related nonkinase ) corresponds to this C - terminal domain ( amino acids 693 – 1052 ) of FAK and functions in a dominant - negative manner 20 . The interaction between DCC and FRNK was also observed in a yeast two - hybrid assay ( data not shown ) , suggesting that they directly interact . The above observations indicate that FRNK may have an inhibitory role in netrin signaling . We tested whether FRNK RESULTS Netrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC and FAK It has been reported that netrin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC in transfected HEK293 cells 14 . It is not known , however , whether the endogenous DCC is tyrosine phosphorylated or which kinase is responsible for DCC tyrosine phosphorylation . To determine whether netrin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC in vivo , we tested dorsal spinal neurons from chick embryos . We observed that netrin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both DCC and FAK ( Fig . 1a ) . To confirm that these effects were due to netrin and not to contami - Figure 1 Netrin - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC and FAK .

Cotransfection of both FAK and Src resulted in syn - ergistic enhancement in DCC tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . 2c ) . These results indicate that both FAK and Src positively contribute to DCC tyrosine phosphorylation . Multiple tyrosine residues in FAK have been mapped as targets of phosphorylation 15 – 17 . Netrin induced the most dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation on residues Tyr576 and Tyr577 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Src has been implicated in the phosphorylation of these two residues which are important for FAK activation 22 . PP2 significantly inhibited tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of Tyr576 and Tyr577 , but had less effect on other tyrosine residues ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , further supporting a positive role of Src in netrin - induced FAK activation . To test whether Src interacts with DCC , we used IP with cotrans - fected DCC and Src . DCC was present in the Src immunoprecipitates , and Src was present in the DCC immunoprecipitates ( Fig . 2d ) . A Src - specific antibody coimmunoprecipitated with DCC from a mouse brain lysate , indicating an interaction between the two proteins in vivo ( Fig . 2e ) . We further examined a possibility of direct interactions among DCC , FAK and Src . The immunoprecipitated FAK and Src interacted with immunopurified DCC in vitro ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , indicating that DCC interacts directly with FAK and Src . The effect of netrin stimulation on the interaction between DCC and Src was examined . Our results show that netrin stimulation enhanced the interaction between DCC and Src ( Fig . 2f ) . Similar experiments were done for FAK , and we found that netrin stimulation could block DCC tyrosine phosphorylation induced by netrin . Our data show that netrin - stimulated DCC tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by FRNK coexpression ( Fig . 1g ) , further supporting the notion that endogenous FAK binding is required for netrin - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC . Physical and functional interaction between DCC and Src Previous studies have established a positive relationship between the activations of FAK and Src 16 , 17 . Hence , we tested the effect of Src using the SFK - specific inhibitor PP2 ( ref . 21 ) . PP2 , but not its inactive analog PP3 , inhibited netrin - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC and FAK ( Fig . 1a ) . To confirm the involvement of Src in DCC signaling , we coexpressed DCC and Src in HEK293 cells . We observed that Src significantly stimulated DCC tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . 2a ) . DCC tyrosine phosphorylation was efficiently inhibited by a concentration of PP2 as low as 0 . 2 µ M ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , sup - porting a specific role of endogenous SFK in netrin signaling . In addition , when only a small amount of Src was coexpressed with DCC , tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC could be further stimulated by netrin ( Fig . 2b ) . Interestingly , netrin also increased phosphoryla - tion of Tyr418 in Src ( Fig . 2b ) , which is a site that is required for Src activation , and is thus used as an indicator 19 . These data suggest that Src stimulates DCC phosphorylation and is also a potential down - stream effector of DCC . We examined whether FAK and Src cooperate to stimulate DCC Figure 2 Src interacts with DCC and is activated by netrin . ( a ) Src activates DCC tyrosine phosphorylation .

( i ) Netrin did not induce DCC tyrosine phosphorylation in Src / Fyn / Yes ( S / F / Y ) triple - knockout MEF cells . DCC and UNC - 5 were cotransfected into wild - type ( WT ) and Src / Fyn / Yes triple knockout MEFs , and then netrin - induced DCC tyrosine phosphorylation was determined .

These results indicate that DCC uses differ - ent mechanisms to interact with FAK and Src . To determine the effect of netrin on Src activation in neurons , we immunoprecipitated Src from mouse embryonic cortical neurons . We found that netrin stimulated Src tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity ( Fig . 2g ) . Similarly , Fyn , a member of the SFKs 23 , was acti - vated by netrin ( Fig . 2h ) . We also found that Fyn interacts with DCC ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . To determine the functional importance of SFKs in netrin stimulation , we examined the Src / Fyn / Yes triple - knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEF ) 24 . Netrin did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of transfected DCC ( Fig . 2i ) . Our results demonstrate that SFKs are required for netrin to induce DCC tyrosine phosphorylation . Tyr1420 is the major tyrosine phosphorylation site in DCC The intracellular domain of DCC contains four tyrosine residues ( Fig . 3a ) . Our results indicate that mutation of Tyr1420 almost com - pletely abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC , whereas individ - ual mutation of the other three tyrosine residues has a minor effect on DCC tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . 3a , b ) . We further confirmed Tyr1420 as the primary FAK - dependent phosphorylation site by cre - ating a mutant DCC in which three tyrosine residues were replaced by phenylalanine , leaving one tyrosine residue . As expected , replacement of all four tyrosine residues by phenylalanine in the intracellular domain of DCC ( DCC - 4Y / F ) completely abolished DCC tyrosine phosphorylation . Similar experiments were done with Src , which demonstrated that Tyr1420 was the major tyrosine phosphorylation site in DCC induced by coexpression of Src with DCC ( Fig . 3c ) . To determine whether FAK or Src can directly phosphorylate DCC , we carried out in vitro phosphorylation experiments using purified recombinant DCC as a substrate . We found that Src could directly phosphorylate DCC , whereas FAK could not ( Fig . 3d ) . The ability of Src to phosphorylate DCC was inhibited by PP2 , and DCC - Y1420F ( DCC in which tyrosine residue 1420 is replaced by phenylalanine ) was not phosphorylated by Src . Hence , these data demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr1420 in DCC results from direct phosphorylation by Src but not FAK . Different regions of DCC interact with FAK and Src The intracellular region of DCC contains three motifs ( P1 , P2 and P3 ) , which are conserved across species ( Fig . 3e ) 7 , 12 . Deletion of P1 ( residues 1147 – 1171 , ∆ P1 ) did not affect FAK binding ( Fig . 3f ) . Notably , deletion of the P2 domain ( residues 1335 – 1356 , ∆ P2 ) reproducibly enhanced the ability of DCC to bind FAK , suggesting that the P2 domain may have an inhibitory effect on FAK binding . In contrast , deletion of the P3 domain ( residues 1412 – 1447 , ∆ P3 ) abolished FAK binding ( Fig . 3f ) and mutation of the tyrosine phos - phorylation site ( DCC - Y1420F ) had no effect on the interaction with FAK ( Fig . 3e , f ) . We also constructed a Y1420F ∆ P3 * mutant , in which the C - terminal 22 residues of DCC ( 1426 – 1447 ) are replaced by 10 unrelated residues . The mutant was not able to interact with FAK ( Fig . 3e , f ) . The importance of the C - terminal half of the P3 domain in FAK interaction was confirmed by the ∆ 1 / 2P3 mutant 1216 VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2004 NATURE NEUROSCIENCE Figure 3 Tyr1420 in DCC is phosphorylated and the P3 domain in DCC interacts with FAK .

As expected , PP2 treatment ( 100 min ) did not inhibit the interaction between DCC and FAK ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . These results demonstrate that the C - terminal half of the P3 domain , but not tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC , is important for FAK interaction . The importance of FAK binding in DCC tyrosine phosphoryla - tion was examined with the ∆ 1 / 2P3 and ∆ P3 mutants . FAK binding was essential for DCC tyrosine phosphorylation in response to FAK coexpression , although FAK was not directly responsible for DCC phosphorylation ( Fig . 3d , g and see model in Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We tested whether the interaction between DCC and FAK is impor - tant for netrin and DCC to activate FAK . We observed that netrin Figure 4 The 1400PXXP motif in DCC and the SH3 domain in Src are required for DCC and Src interaction .

Experiments are similar to those shown in Figure 3g . A R T I C L E S treatment of DCC - ∆ 1 / 2P3 and ∆ P3 mutants showed a markedly decreased ability to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK . In contrast , mutation of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in DCC had no significant effect on the ability of DCC to stimulate FAK tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . 3h ) . These data suggest that the abil - ity to interact with FAK is important for DCC to activate FAK . The fact that FAK is required for DCC tyrosine phosphorylation , whereas it does not directly phosphorylate DCC , indicates that FAK may also function as a scaffold protein . We examined the effect of kinase - inactive mutant FAK - KD on DCC tyrosine phosphorylation . Expression of FAK - KD induced a minor increase of DCC phosphory - lation , as compared to the wild - type FAK ( Fig . 3i ) . Coexpression of FAK - KD and Src stimulated DCC phosphorylation , although this combination was less effective than the coexpression of wild - type FAK and Src . These observations indicate that both kinase - dependent and kinase - independent functions of FAK contribute to DCC phos - phorylation . Kinase - independent scaffolding functions of FAK have been reported previously 25 , 26 . The above data support the view that FAK may also function as a scaffold by recruiting Src to the DCC complex ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . DCC tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for Src binding because DCC - 4Y / F was found to bind Src ( Fig . 4a ) . Deletion of the P1 , P2 or P3 domain did not affect the interaction with Src ( Fig . 4b , data not shown for P1 and P2 deletions ) . This would suggest that Src and FAK bind different regions of DCC . We found that applica - tion of the inhibitor PP2 ( 20 – 100 min ) weakened the interaction NATURE NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2004 1217 Figure 5 Src activity is required for netrin - induced axon growth .

However , our observations that DCC - 4Y / F still binds Src ( Fig . 4a ) suggest that tyrosine phosphory - lation of a protein other than DCC is probably required for the full interaction between DCC and Src . The fact that Src binds to DCC - 4Y / F suggests that the SH3 domain of Src may interact with DCC . The intracellular domain of DCC con - tains nine PXXP motifs as putative SH3 binding sites ( Fig . 4c ) . Deletion of residues 1309 – 1318 , which contains the first two PXXP motifs , and 1335 – 1356 , which contains the next two PXXP motifs , showed no significant effect on the interaction between DCC and Src ( data not shown ) . Point mutations of PXXP motifs at Pro1359 , Pro1362 , Pro1372 , Pro1393 and Pro1400 were constructed and tested . We observed that mutation of Pro1400 disrupted the interaction with Src ( Fig . 4d , e ) , whereas mutation of other proline residues did not affect the interaction ( Fig . 4e and data not shown ) . These results demonstrate that the PXXP motif , beginning at residue 1400 , is important for Src binding and that the Src SH3 domain is likely to be involved . We created a Src SH3 - domain mutant ( Src - SH3M ) by mutating the conserved Trp127 , and this mutant showed reduced interaction with DCC ( Fig . 4e ) . Notably , PP2 was able to further inhibit the interaction between Src and DCC - P1400A ( a mutant in which proline residue 1400 has been replaced by alanine ) and between Src - SH3M and DCC ( Fig . 4d , e ) , which suggests that the DCC interac - tion with the Src SH3 domain is not the only factor contributing to the interaction . It is possible that the Src SH2 domain might interact with another phosphotyrosine - containing protein , possibly FAK , to enhance the Src interaction with DCC ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We next determined the ability of Src to phosphorylate DCC mutants . Elimination of FAK binding in DCC decreased Src - induced DCC phos - phorylation ( Fig . 4f ) . Furthermore , Src could still increase phosphoryla - tion of DCC - P1400A , which is defective in Src interaction . These observations are consistent with a model that FAK recruits Src to the DCC complex and Src phosphorylates DCC ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The kinase - inactive FAK mutant , FAK - KD , consistently cooperated with Src to stimulate DCC phosphorylation ( Fig . 3i ) . Inhibition of netrin - stimulated axon growth by PP2 To determine the function of Src in netrin - stimulated axon growth , we tested the effect of the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 on the axon out - growth of dorsal spinal explants isolated from E12 rats in response to netrin stimulation . Consistent with previous studies 1 , 2 , 27 , there was little axon outgrowth from these explants in the absence of netrin - 1 after 20 h in culture ( Fig . 5a ) . Netrin - 1 dramatically stimulated com - missural axon outgrowth from the explants ( Fig . 5a ) . Immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody to TAG - 1 , a marker for commissural neurons , confirmed the commissural nature of these axons ( data not shown ) . Commissural axon outgrowth induced by netrin - 1 was inhibited by PP2 , but not by PP3 ( Fig . 5a , b ) . In contrast , PP2 had no significant inhibition on the spontaneous axon outgrowth ( Fig . 5c ) . These results support the view that tyro - sine phosphorylation and activity of the SFKs are important for netrin - stimulated axon growth . 1218 VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2004 NATURE NEUROSCIENCE Figure 6 Src function or DCC tyrosine phosphorylation is required for DCC - mediated axon attraction .

We tested the effect of various PP2 concentrations on the netrin - induced outgrowth and attraction of the X . laevis spinal neuron growth cones . As expected , netrin induced both axon growth and attraction ( Fig . 6 ) . We found that incubation with the Src inhibitor PP2 at a concentra - tion higher than 0 . 2 µ M inhibited axon growth ( data not shown ) , further supporting the importance of SFK in netrin - stimulated axon growth . However , 0 . 1 µ M PP2 only partially reduced axon growth ( Fig . 6c ) , which enabled us to test the effect of PP2 on axon turning . We observed that 0 . 1 µ M PP2 almost completely blocked netrin - induced axon turning , whereas 0 . 1 µ M PP3 had no effect ( Fig . 6a – c ) . These data are consistent with a role for SFKs in netrin - induced growth cone attraction . We further tested different Src mutants in the axon turning assay . Expressing the kinase - inactive Src - KM blocked both netrin - induced axon attraction and growth ( Fig . 6d – f ) , supporting the importance of Src in netrin signaling . The SH3 domain mutant ( Src - SH3M ) also abol - ished the netrin - induced attraction , but it had a smaller effect on netrin - induced axon growth ( Fig . 6d – f ) . In contrast , expression of the SH2 domain mutant ( Src - SH2M ) showed a more dramatic inhibition of axon growth but had little effect on axon turning ( Fig . 6d – f ) . The differ - ential effects of Src - SH2M and Src - SH3M on netrin response indicate that our results probably are not due to a nonspecific toxic effect of the Src mutants . These results suggest that SH2 and SH3 domains of Src may participate preferentially in different signaling pathways down - stream of DCC , one in axon outgrowth and the other in axon attraction . To determine the functional significance of DCC tyrosine phospho - rylation in netrin signaling , we tested the phosphorylation - defective DCC - Y1420F mutant . We found that netrin - induced attraction was significantly diminished in X . laevis spinal neurons expressing DCC - Y1420F but not wild - type DCC ( Fig . 6g ) . Because the X . laevis spinal neurons without ectopic DCC expression showed an attractive response to netrin , our data suggest that DCC - Y1420F functions as a dominant - negative receptor and blocks signaling of the endogenous DCC . Our observations demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC is important for netrin signaling , and DCC also serves as a key downstream substrate of the FAK - Src complex . DISCUSSION In this report , we have demonstrated that netrin stimulation results in the activation of FAK and Src tyrosine kinases , as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of DCC , in dorsal spinal neurons , cortical neurons and transfected HEK293 cells . Experiments with an axon outgrowth assay using rat spinal neurons and in vitro axon turning of X . laevis spinal neurons suggest that SFK is centrally involved in DCC - mediated netrin signaling . SFK activity is required for both axon growth and attraction in response to netrin stimulation . We propose that DCC functions as a tyrosine kinase – coupled receptor by directly interacting and activating FAK and Src . This conclusion is supported by independent and complementary studies 29 , 30 . Interestingly , another recent report shows that clr - 1 , a protein tyrosine phos - phatase , is involved in UNC - 6 / netrin – mediated axon attraction in C . elegans 31 . Similarly to high eukaryotes , the UNC - 40 / DCC receptor is required for axon attraction induced by UNC - 6 / netrin in C . ele - gans . This study suggests that clr - 1 probably dephosphorylates a key protein in the netrin signaling pathway , possibly UNC - 40 / DCC . These findings are consistent with our conclusions that DCC func - tions as a tyrosine kinase – coupled receptor and that tyrosine phos - phorylation of DCC is critical for netrin signaling . Signal transduction via tyrosine kinase – coupled receptors has been widely used by many transmembrane receptors , such as cytokines and T - cell receptors . Our study supports a model by which DCC may also use a similar mechanism ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Three motifs in the intracellular domain , known as P1 , P2 and P3 , are conserved among DCC family members from different species 7 , 12 . The P1 domain has been implicated in the interaction with UNC - 5 and is important for the functional complex of DCC with UNC - 5 ( ref . 12 ) . The DCC / UNC - 5 receptor complex is important for netrin to induce growth cone repul - sion . The P2 domain , which is rich in prolines , may play a role in pro - tein - protein interactions . The P3 domain has been shown to interact with the Slit receptor , Robo 32 . The association between Robo and DCC may be important for Slit to silence the netrin - induced growth cone attraction . We demonstrated that FAK and Src interact with DCC under physiological conditions , via different mechanisms and through different regions of DCC . FAK interacts via its C - terminal domain , with the C - terminal half of the P3 domain of DCC ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The SH3 domain of Src interacts with a single PXXP motif , beginning at residue Pro1400 , of DCC . Furthermore , the interaction between Src and DCC is stimulated by netrin and partially inhibited by PP2 , indicating a role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the interaction between Src and DCC . In contrast , the interaction between FAK and DCC is not stimulated by netrin nor inhibited by PP2 . Our results suggest a model in which different regions of DCC are responsible for interacting with FAK and Src ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We propose that netrin binding to DCC activates the associated FAK . FAK autophosphorylates on Tyr397 and recruits Src ( or enhances the interaction between Src and DCC ) . Thus , FAK also shows a scaffold - ing function , likely by recruiting Src to the receptor complex . FAK and Src in the receptor complex positively stimulate each other . The active FAK and Src then phosphorylate target molecules , including the DCC receptor , which in turn induce downstream signaling events . The importance of SFK in netrin signaling is demonstrated by our axon turning experiments using the Src inhibitor PP2 and dominant - negative Src mutants . Furthermore , the importance of DCC tyrosine phosphorylation is supported by our observation that the DCC - Y1420F mutant interferes with netrin - induced axon attraction . Therefore , in addition to functioning as an upstream receptor , DCC also serves as a critical downstream substrate of FAK and Src in netrin signaling . This mechanism of action is similar to that used by cytokine receptors , where phosphorylation of the receptor by Jak family kinases is important for cytokine signaling . However , DCC tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for the activation of Src and FAK . Tyrosine - phosphorylated DCC may create binding sites for SH2 - containing downstream signaling molecules . Future studies will be needed to identify substrates phosphorylated by Src and FAK , as well as proteins that interact with phospho - DCC—these studies will provide further insights into the mechanism of DCC signaling in response to netrin stimulation . Several proteins have been reported to participate in netrin signal - ing , including PI3K 33 , Rho family GTPases 34 – 36 and ERK MAP kinase 37 , 38 . How DCC receptor activation leads to modulation of these downstream molecules is currently unknown . Both FAK and Src are known to regulate PI3K , Rho family small GTPases and ERK 16 , 25 . Therefore , our study provides a possible mechanism by which DCC could modulate these downstream signaling molecules . Netrin can stimulate both axon growth and turning initiated by the same netrin receptor , DCC . However , the intracellular signaling path - ways for axon growth and turning may diverge after the receptor - proximal events . For example , the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) is involved in netrin - induced axon growth but not the turn - NATURE NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2004 1219 © 2004 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e n e u r o sc i e n ce A R T I C L E S ing response 39 . In contrast , the Slit receptor Robo silences netrin - induced turning but not the outgrowth response 32 . We observed that expression of the kinase - inactive Src mutant , Src - KM , blocked both axon outgrowth and turning in response to netrin ( Fig . 6d – f ) . These data suggest that Src activation is a receptor - proximal event and important for both axon outgrowth and the turning responses . Notably , mutations in the SH2 and SH3 domains preferentially inhib - ited netrin - induced axon outgrowth and turning , respectively . These observations suggest that Src - SH2M and Src - SH3M may selectively block downstream signaling pathways leading to axon outgrowth or turning . Future experiments are required to test whether Src - SH2M blocks the NFAT pathway and whether Src - SH3M mimics the effect of Robo silencing . METHODS Plasmids and cell culture . The neuronal isoform of c - Src ( GenBank accession number 625219 ) was constructed by PCR from a human brain cDNA library , and subcloned into pcDNA3 ( Invitrogen ) . FAK and related plasmids were described previously 40 . Src SH3 ( 127 / 128WW / RR ) , SH2 ( 178R / A ) and kinase dead ( 298K / M ) mutants , as well as DCC - ∆ P1 ( ∆ 1147 – 1170 ) , ∆ P2 ( ∆ 1335 – 1356 ) , ∆ P3 ( ∆ 1412 – 1447 ) , Y1420F , P1400A and other DCC expression constructs , were con - structed by mutagenesis ( Stratagene ) . pGEX - KG - DCC , pEBG3X - HV - DCC , MBP - DCC / pMAL - p2 and AP ( alkaline phosphatase ) - netrin / pcDNA3 were con - structed by PCR and subcloned into the indicated vectors . HEK293 cells stably expressing chick myc - netrin were a generous gift from M . Tessier - Lavigne ( Stanford University ) . Antibodies . We used the following antibodies in our experiments : anti - DCC ( PharMingen and Oncogene ) , anti - Fyn , pan - anti - Src , anti - Lyn , anti - Yes , anti - FAK ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - Src ( Oncogene , Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology ) , anti - phospho - Src ( Bioscience and Cell Signaling ) , anti - hemagglutinin ( HA ) ( Covance ) , anti - phospho - Tyr ( PY20 from Transduction Laboratories and 4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology ) and an anti - phospho - FAK kit ( Biosource ) . X . laevis embryo microinjection and primary spinal neuron cultures . Capped mRNAs were synthesized using mMESSAGE mMACHINE ( Ambion ) as sug - gested by the manufacturer . The transcription products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( QIAGEN ) . In vitro fertilization was carried out as described 12 . Src or DCC mutant mRNAs were injected into two blastomeres of X . laevis embryos at the four - cell stage . For each blastomere , we injected 4 – 8 µ l of mRNA solution containing either 0 . 15 µ g / µ l or 0 . 25 µ g / µ l of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) mRNA . GFP was used as an indicator for expression of the sample mRNA . Cultures of spinal neurons were prepared as described previously 41 . Immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding . HEK293 cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine ( Invitrogen ) method . For immunoprecipitation ( IP ) , generally , cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in mild lysis buffer ( MLB : 20 mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 mM phenylmethylsul - fonyl fluoride , 5 µ g / ml aprotinin and 5 µ g / ml leupeptin ) and subjected to IP with 1 µ g of antibody . Two hours later , protein A / G – agarose beads ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) were added for a further 1 . 5 h and then washed four times prior to addition of 1 × SDS sample buffer . For phosphotyrosine immunoblot experiments , PLC buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM NaPP i , 100 mM NaF , 1 mM vanadate and protease inhibitors ) was used in cell lysis . To inhibit SFK activity , the inhibitor PP2 ( Calbiochem ) was added to serum - starved cells at a concentration of 0 . 2 – 5 µ M in 1 % DMSO for 1 h . Tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting using PY20 antibody . Three fresh mouse brains were Dounce - homogenized in 12 ml of PBS con - taining protease inhibitors . Lysates were centrifuged three consecutive times at 15 , 000 g to remove the insoluble fraction and then ultracentrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 40 min . The soluble fraction was removed and the pellet fraction was washed once with PBS . The pellet was resuspended in PLC buffer and then centrifuged at 15 , 000 g for 5 min to remove insoluble debris . The solubi - lized membrane fraction was then divided into two groups and subjected to IP with , in the case of the Src IP , 5 µ g of mouse antibodies specific to Src B12 or GAL4 RK5C1 . In the case of the FAK IP , solubilized membranes were divided into three groups and immunoprecipitated with 5 µ g of the antibod - ies specific to FAK C20 , HA probe or c - Myc . IPs were subjected to immunoblotting ( IB ) with anti - DCC ( PharMingen ) , which recognizes the intracellular domain of DCC . HEK293 cells were transfected independently with expression constructs for HA - FAK and Src . At 24 h after transfection , cells were lysed in MLB with protease inhibitors and cleared by centrifugation at 15 , 000 g . The lysates were then incubated for 1 h with GST or GST - DCC intracellular domain ( expressed and purified from Escherichia coli or HEK293 cells ) precoupled to glutathione - agarose beads . Beads were then washed several times and protein was eluted with 1 × SDS sample buffer . Bound HA - FAK or Src was determined by immunoblotting with HA - specific ( Babco ) or Src - specific antibody . In vitro kinase assay . The kinase assay was done essentially as described previ - ously 42 . HA - FAK , Src and Fyn were obtained by immunoprecipitation from expression of transiently transfected HEK293 cells , primary neuron cultures from mouse embryonic brain cortex and dorsal spinal cord of chick embryos . MBP - DCC protein purified from E . coli and Cdc2 purchased from Upstate Biotechnology ( cat . # 17 - 111 ) were used as substrates . The phosphorylation levels of DCC by FAK , Src and Src and Fyn kinase activities were determined by phosphoimaging and scintillation counting . The nitrocellulose membrane was stained by Coomassie blue to determine MBP - DCC levels . The levels of FAK , Src and Fyn were determined by immunoblotting . Neuronal cultures and analysis of axon outgrowth . For the spinal cords , small rectangular explants were made from the dorsal half of rat embryonic day 12 ( E12 ) and mouse E13 spinal cords . Explants were transferred into a drop of rat tail collagen , and another drop of collagen was added on the explants . After polymerization , gels were covered with conditioned media of control HEK293 cells or netrin - 1 - secreting HEK293 cells in the absence or presence of pharma - cological reagents . Overnight cultures were used to observe the effect of netrin - 1 on axon outgrowth . The number and length of axon bundles from the spinal cord explants were measured with NIH Image software ( National Institutes of Health ) . Dorsal spinal cords were dissected from E7 chick embryos . The isolated spinal cords were triturated to generate dissociated neuronal cells , which were plated on laminin - coated plates in neuron culture medium as described 2 . For primary cortical neuronal culture , the cortex was dissected out from E12 mouse embryonic brain in HBSS buffer and was triturated mechanically in L15 medium supplemented with 0 . 5 % B27 , 1 % N2 and 30 mM glucose . The dissociated neurons were cultured in six - well plates coated with poly - L - lysine and laminin . The cells were cultured overnight and then stimulated with netrin . Use of laboratory animals was approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals ( Protocol # 8719 ) . Growth cone turning assay . A microscopic gradient of netrin - 1 protein was pro - duced as previously described 12 . Microscopic images of neurites were recorded with a CCD camera ( Hitachi KP - M2U ) attached to a phase contrast microscope ( Olympus CK - 40 ) and analyzed using NIH Image 1 . 62 . The final turning angle , defined by the angle between the original direction of neurite extension and a straight line connecting the positions of the growth cone at the onset and the end of the 1 - h period , was measured . Only those growth cones with net exten - sion of at least 7 µ m over the 1 - h period were included for analysis . Note : Supplementary information is available on the Nature Neuroscience website .
