ROLE OF PROTEIN KINASE C ( PKC ) ISOFORMS IN REGULATION OF FILOPODIA DYNAMICS Pratima Pandey A Thesis Submitted to the Graduate College of Bowling Green State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of MASTER OF SCIENCE May 2016 Committee : Carol Heckman , Advisor Neocles Leontis Zhaohui Xu © 2016 Pratima Pandey All Rights Reserved iii ABSTRACT Carol Heckman , Advisor Filopodia are the sensory appendages of the cell and have an important role in directing motility , wound healing , and axon pathfinding . Previous work showed that oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells was accompanied by the loss of filopodia . The role of filopodia as sites for adhesion and signaling is well known but the dynamics is poorly understood . The core of the filopodium is a parallel array of actin filaments . Mallavarapu and Mitchison have proposed that filopodia are retracted by halting actin assembly at the tip of the filaments , whereupon the filaments disassemble at the opposite end . Based on previous work , it was postulated that the filopodia are affected by PKC activation in such a way that actin arrays are disassembled . To study this , synthetic peptides representing the hydrophobic segment of PKC and the effector domain of myristoylated alanine - rich C kinase substrate ( MARCKS ) were designed to block PKC’s effects . After treatment with peptides , cells were collected with and without a brief exposure to phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) . PMA activates the classical and novel PKCs . The cells were evaluated by phase contrast microscopy . The mean percentage periphery of the cells covered with filopodia and the percentage of cells in a population showing filopodia were counted . When cells were treated with peptides alone , no effect was observed but when treated with PMA , PKC ε blocking peptide partially rescued the filopodia from destruction . This was significant in the t - test ( P - value < 0 . 025 ) . Because rescue was only pertinent to PMA - treated cells , and the same treatment had no effect on filopodia of untreated cells , I postulate that PKC ε works by a different mechanism than that governing regular dynamics . iv I also studied the effect of protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) inhibitors on filopodia . The PTP1B inhibitor enhanced filopodia in both PMA - treated and - untreated conditions . The TC - PTP inhibitor did not affect cells treated with it alone but , when PMA - treated , prevented filopodia from disassembly . The data for PTP inhibitors , like that for the synthetic peptides , suggests there may be an active mechanism of filopodia disassembly . Thus , a mechanism of disassembly in addition to the Mallavarapu mechanism may exist . v To my parents , Mr . Gokarna Raj Pandey and Mrs .

INTRODUCTION 1 . 1 Cell motility and cell adhesion Cell motility has a very important role in various biological processes such as embryonic development , wound healing , immune responses and tissue development . It has a role in both normal physiology and disease . Cell motility involves coordinated activity of the cytoskeleton , membrane and adhesion complexes [ 1 ] . Polarization and protrusion or extension of the cell , in response to different environmental cues , are characteristic of the migrating cell . Abnormal cell migration is an important feature of metastatic cells . Cells are stabilized on the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) by means of adhesion . For anchorage - dependent cells , the movement is enabled by the cell’s gaining traction on the substrate . Thus , the nature of the ECM is an important determinant of motility . Directed cell migration includes basically four steps : extension of a protrusion , formation of new adhesions on ECM , translocation of the cell body , and de - adhesion at the trailing edge ( Figure 1 ) . The process of migration can be broken down into two components , however . There is a motor function clearly implicated in translocating the cell , as mentioned above , which requires movement relative to the substrate . Secondly , there is a direction - setting function . A useful analogy might be drawn with the automobile , where these functions would be the equivalents of the motor / powertrain and steering assembly . The protrusion force at the leading edge of a cell is generated by the cytoskeleton . This force is controlled by multiple signaling cascades . The formation of new adhesions at the front and the release of adhesions at the rear involve signaling mediated by Rho - family guanine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) and their accessory proteins , and rely upon integrins , which are receptors for the ECM components . Cell migration is initiated and modulated by external chemical and mechanical factors , such as chemo 2 attractants and the mechanical forces acting on the cells . The surface density , distribution , and topography of molecules in the ECM , as well as its overall rigidity also affect the cell motility process . Figure 1 . Four steps of cell migration : extension of protrusion , adhesion to a new site , translocation of the cell body , and detachment at the trailing edge .

Multicellular organization of cells depends on cohesion between cells . Cell to cell contacts hold them together to form a multicellular sheet or epithelium . Epithelial cells line the inner and outer surfaces of the body . Several transmembrane adhesion receptors like integrin , cadherin , selectin , and the immunoglobulin family of cell adhesion molecules are present on the cell surface . Apart from their adhesive functions , these molecules also mediate signal transduction . Cadherins are responsible for making connections between cells . The adhesive complexes on ECM are different from those involved in cell - cell adhesion . Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that mediate adhesion to the ECM ( see below ) . ECM includes a variety of secreted proteins and large glycoproteins like collagens , fibronectins , laminins , and proteoglycans . Transmembrane receptors in the plasma membrane of the cell connect these adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton and to signaling molecules present inside the cell . Some adaptor proteins maintain structure in the cytoskeleton , including catenins , talin , filamin , tensin , vinculin , and α - actinin . Actins are linked to integrins via different types of adaptor proteins like talin , vinculin , paxillin , and parvin . Integrins are involved in the matrix - induced assembly of large signaling platforms called focal adhesions , and many signaling molecules activated by integrins are associated with these adhesive plaques [ 2 ] . Thus , adaptor - mediated linkages facilitate signal transduction from outside of the cell via integrins to the inside of the cell . 4 Figure 2 . Cell - cell interaction and cell - matrix interaction . These interactions are mediated by different kinds of adhesion proteins present on the surface of the cell [ 3 ] . Integrins are a family of 24 heterodimers formed of non - covalently associated α - and β - subunits [ 4 ] in mammals . 18 α and 8 β type subunits are present . Each of the heterodimers is unique and binds to specific ligands . Each subunit consists of an NH2 - terminal extracellular domain , a transmembrane domain , and a cytoplasmic tail [ 5 ] . The extracellular domains determine the binding specificity . Upon recognition of a matrix ligand , there is a conformational change of integrins revealing their cytoplasmic tail . Then multi - protein complexes are recruited to the site for focal adhesion formation ( Figure 3 ) . Integrins are expressed at high levels on the surface of all cell types with few exceptions . For example , they are not found on erythrocytes . They are important in many physiological processes like attachment , cytoskeletal organization , migration , mechanosensing , signal transduction , proliferation and differentiation . Integrins are not constitutively active proteins , as explained below . 5 Figure 3 . Integrins , sites of focal adhesions . The figure shows the variety of multiprotein complexes that mediate this process . [ 5 ] Integrin signaling can be demonstrated in an ordered series of events . The initial event is integrin activation , followed by integrin engagement and integrin signaling , integrin clustering and focal adhesion assembly and finally integrin inactivation . These steps are reversible and depend upon the specific type of integrins involved , the nature and organization of ECM , the cell type , the presence of co - signaling receptors and the subcellular localization of integrin . Integrin activation causes some changes in the ligand binding site of the integrin ectodomain . Binding of the FERM domain of talin to the beta - integrin tail triggers the activation of actin probably by disrupting the inhibitory interactions between alpha and beta subunit cytoplasmic tails . Talin thereby links activated integrins to signaling and cytoskeletal structures . The integrin cytoplasmic domain associated protein 1 ( ICAP1 ) inhibits integrin activation by competing with talin for binding to integrin . The proteins of the kindlin family also act as integrin activators . 6 Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , Rous sarcoma virus membrane associated protein tyrosine kinase ( Src ) , integrin linked kinases , paxillin , vinculin , and probably some other proteins play an important role in signaling from the scaffold formed at integrin adhesions . Disengagement of integrin with its ligand and other intracellular multi - protein complexes leads to termination of integrin signaling and facilitates the migration of cell . Harburger and Calderwood have explained the series of events of integrin signaling [ 6 ] . 1 . 2 Cell polarity Cell polarity refers to the asymmetric ( polarized ) organization of different aspects of cells like the cell surface , cell organelles , other cellular components and the cytoskeleton . Cell polarity is a basic property of eukaryotic cells . Some of the more obvious examples of polarized cells are epithelial cells , neurons and migratory cells , but it is mainly the epithelial cells that show apical - basal polarization . Loss of epithelial cell polarity is related to cell plasticity , or the ability to differentiate into another cell type . Cell plasticity is a feature of epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , whereby epithelial cells lose apical - basal polarity and cell junctions and acquire a migratory mesenchymal phenotype . The maintenance of cell polarity for normal cell physiology and functioning and homeostasis is very critical . Loss of cell polarity or dysregulated polarity may lead to developmental disorders and cancers . The loss of cell polarity contributes to the tissue disorganization , which , along with cell growth , is a hallmark of epithelial cancer . So , loss of cell - cell adhesion and apical - basal polarity leads to EMT . 7 1 . 3 Actin mediated cellular migration Actin is an abundant protein in eukaryotic cells , and it has diverse roles in cellular functions . It is involved in cell motility , maintenance of cell shape and polarity and also regulation of transcription . The actin monomer is a 42 - kDa protein , which makes up a double - stranded helical actin filament [ 7 ] . Actin is present in cells either in globular form called G - actin or in filamentous form called F - actin . As shown in Figure 4 , F - actin is polar in nature and has two different types of ends called plus end and minus end . The ( + ) end of filaments generally has a high concentration of F - actin - ATP and favors the addition of new actin molecules . Thus , it is often the growing end of the filament . The ( - ) end generally has a high concentration of F - actin - ADP and , because the ADP form is less stable in the filament , this is the shrinking end of the actin filament . Plus ends are also called barbed ends and minus ends pointed ends . The actin filament is arranged in such a way that barbed end is towards the plasma membrane and the pointed end towards the interior of the cell . There are many actin - based membrane protrusive structures like lamellipodia , filopodia , ruffles , and lamella in migratory cells . 8 Figure 4 . Actin dynamics . Actin polymerization relies upon the availability of ATP - bound G - actin . In the filament , ATP - actin is hydrolyzed to ADP ⋅ actin as the filament ages . ADP - actin forms unstable positions in the filaments , which leads to depolymerization . ATP monomers assemble at a far higher rate than ADP ones . In treadmilling filaments , ATP bound subunits at the barbed end are added at the same rate as ADP - bound subunits are falling off the pointed end . Adapted with permission from [ 8 ] . Actin polymerization and depolymerization is a highly coordinated system that provides a basis for cell motility and adhesion . The assembly and disassembly of actin filament involves many proteins , commonly known as actin - binding proteins . Many cell features are formed and maintained by the actin cytoskeleton . These features include membrane protrusions like microvilli , stereocilia , bristles ( in flies ) , the lamellipodium , and the filopodium [ 8 ] . The Rho family of small GTP - binding proteins plays a central role in regulating the dynamic modulation of the actin . Cell migration includes some coordinated steps like cytoskeletal - mediated protrusions of filopodia and lamellopodia , formation of focal adhesions at the leading edge , disassembly of 9 adhesive contacts and actomyosin - dependent retraction at the trailing edge . In migrating cells , the focal adhesions are constantly assembled and disassembled as the cell establishes new contacts at the leading edge and detaches the cell from the substrate at the trailing edge of the cell . Lamellipodia are broad sheet - like protrusions [ 9 ] , whereas filopodia are pointed slender structures . The lamellipodium consists of a meshwork of branched actin filaments assembled by the Arp2 / 3 complex whereas actin filaments in filopodia are parallel and cross - linked into bundles . Linkages between integrins and actin form focal adhesions , as shown in Figure 3 . Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) is recruited to the focal adhesion site by the integrin binding proteins paxillin and talin . FAK transduces integrin signals to guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) to regulate their activity . Hyperphosphorylated FAK dissolves focal adhesions [ 10 ] . With FAK - mediated phosphorylation at Y12 , α - actinin shows a decrease in actin binding [ 11 ] . α - actinin is found to interact with many other proteins such as vinculin , zyxin and palladin . Normally , α - actinin crosslinks actin into stress fibers and tethers them to the focal adhesions . Other proteins like zyxin , Src , and calpain are involved in focal adhesions . Ruffles are mainly formed from lamellipodium detachment . The higher the ruffle frequency , lower the lamellipodium persistence [ 12 ] . 10 Figure 5 . Cytoskeletal structures involved in cell migration [ 13 ] . 1 . 4 Filopodia Filopodia are slender , tapered protrusions of plasma membrane which have a core of parallel actin filaments and are anchored to the substrate by focal adhesions [ 14 ] . The arrangement of the parallel actin filaments is such that the barbed ends are facing towards the plasma membrane . Filopodia are oriented toward the direction of protrusion and migration [ 15 ] . Filopodia are important for many essential cellular processes like cell adhesion , angiogenesis , and the formation of dendritic spines . The majority of information about their physiological regulation comes from studies of nerve growth cone , where they are numerous and organized at a readily recognizable pole of the cell . Polymerization and crosslinking of actin filaments is 11 required for the initiation and elongation of filopodia . Fascin , a type of crosslinking protein , mediates the formation of actin filament bundles . Other proteins like fimbrin , espin , and α - actinin may also be involved in this process . As it is known that actin filaments are polarized in nature , this facilitates the motor proteins to actively transport cargoes toward the tips of the protrusions . Most of the actin filaments in filopodia are parallel and unbranched unlike in lamellipodia [ 16 ] . During the process of assembly , the actin subunits are added to the filopodial tips , i . e . barbed end , and are subtracted from the other end i . e . minus end . Filopodia formation therefore depends on the nucleation of actin filaments . Proteins like Arp2 / 3 complex and the formin family of proteins may be involved in this process . The GTPase Cdc42 is a regulator of filopodia formation and can interact with proteins such as N - WASP ( Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ) to activate Arp2 / 3 and nucleate new actin filaments [ 17 , 18 ] . Proteins such as VASP and formins regulate actin polymerization rather than Arp2 / 3 complex at the tips of filopodia [ 18 ] . VASP family proteins stimulate filopodia formation , presumably because of their anticapping activity [ 19 , 20 ] , but they also regulate formation of lamellipodia . The exact role of each of these protein or protein complexes in initiation is not known . Thus , those that are indispensible have yet to be sorted out from those that are not essential but may participate in the process . After the nucleation is over , numerous proteins perform their roles in extension of filopodia . In order to elongate , the barbed end should be protected from being capped by capping proteins ( β - actinin , CapZ or Cap32 / 34 ) . Proteins such as Ena / VASP are delivered to the barbed end by myosin X for this purpose , which enhances the polymerization and elongation process . Integrins β 1 , β 3 , and β 5 are also bound and transported by myosin X . When myosin X is overexpressed , formation and elongation of filopodia is enhanced in an integrin dependent manner [ 21 ] . 12 When actin filaments get bundled up and start exerting force on the inside of plasma membrane , a thin finger protrudes from the cell , which turns into the filopodium . Filopodia act as a sensory part of the cell that probes the environment for signals and functions in the leading edge to transmit the signals . They can extend , retract and move laterally while sensing the environment [ 22 ] . Filopodia are found in different types of cells . It is seen that if a cell is turning toward a chemoattractant it exhibits an increased number of filopodia on the side that is facing the attractant . The role of filopodia as the sensors of the local environment and as sites for adhesion and signaling is well known . The advancement in microscopy techniques especially electron microscopy have allowed researchers to gain insight into the molecular organization of filopodia . Figure 6 .

In epithelial cells , integrins are a basic component of focal adhesion and are needed for activation of proteins such as FAK , Src , and other scaffold proteins leading to a stable adhesion of a cell to the ECM . A large number of signaling cascades regulate a cell’s response to external ligand / cues . These cascades involve numerous proteins such as small Rho GTPases , GEFs , GAPs , and downstream protein kinases , and converge at points that regulate the actin dynamics . In addition , several other actin regulatory proteins such as cortactin , mammalian Diaphanous ( mDia ) , WASP - family verprolin - homologous ( WAVE ) , and WASP also regulate the actin cytoskeleton , which in turn affects many biological processes . Skewed signaling to the cytoskeleton is observed in many pathological conditions . In Figure 7 , we can see how the signals from extracellular ligands are transmitted downstream with the aid of various proteins and finally affect the cellular features by regulating actin cytoskeleton . 14 Figure 7 . Actin regulation . Detailed illustration of regulation of actin cytoskeleton and its output . Illustration reproduced courtesy of Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . ( www . cellsignal . com ) 15 1 . 6 PKC 1 . 6 . 1 Structure PKC is a protein of interest , which , for reasons discussed further below , may have a role in filopodia destruction . PKC is a multigene family of serine / threonine kinase enzymes consisting of at least 10 isoforms . The 10 members evolved from a smaller number of precursors . There are two PKCs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 23 ] . These family members have found to be very significant in cellular proliferation , migration and differentiation . They mediate signal transduction events that regulate actin cytoskeleton [ 24 ] and membrane dynamics [ 25 ] . The subtypes of protein kinase C are classified based on their activators . All the isozymes have a phosphatidylserine - binding domain , and all share a common organization . There is a carboxyl - terminal catalytic domain but the amino - terminal regulatory domains differ among the subtypes or classes ( Figure 8 ) . A hinge region that can undergo proteolytic cleavage by cellular proteases connects these two domains . PKC structure has conserved domains referred to as C1 - C4 which are interrupted by variable regions called as V1 - V5 [ 26 ] . All PKCs have an autoinhibitory domain , called pseudosubstrate , in the beginning of C1 region that occupies the substrate - binding site in the catalytic domain and keeps the enzyme in a folded form in the absence of cofactors and activators . Conventional / classical cPKC ( α , β I , β II , γ ) can be activated by diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , through binding to the C - 1 domain , and Ca 2 + through binding to a Ca 2 + - binding site in the C - 2 domain . Non - conventional / novel nPKCs ( δ , ε , η , θ ) lack a calcium - binding domain in the C2 region and thus are calcium independent but are still responsive to DAG . All PKCs have a phosphatidylserine binding domain , which recruits them to membranes . The atypical aPKCs ( ζ , λ ) have a variant C1 domain that is unable to bind DAG or phorbol esters . The C2 region is absent , and they are not activated by Ca 2 + either . They are responsive to phosphoinositides and 16 unsaturated fatty acids . Towards the N - terminal end they contain a Phox and Bem1 ( PB1 ) domain involved in protein interactions . Phorbol ester tumor promoters , such as PMA , are surrogates of diacylglycerol and activate both conventional and novel isoforms . The affinity for DAG is higher in nPKCs than in cPKCs . Trp at a conserved position in C1b domain in case of cPKCs accounts for the low affinity for DAG whereas Tyr at the equivalent position on C1b domain in nPKCs explains for the higher affinity . Unlike other isozymes , atypical PKCs have Glu at phosphoacceptor position of the hydrophobic motif [ 27 ] . PKC ε differs from all the other isoforms in having an actin binding site [ 28 ] . Figure 8 : Schematic structure of PKC isozymes showing different domains . It also shows different domain and activators of each type of isoforms [ 27 ] . PKCs are involved in various cellular processes like intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth , differentiation , and apoptosis and also in the rearrangement 17 of the cytoskeleton and cell migration . Because of the structural differences and variability in substrate specificity , the PKCs may have diverse and sometimes opposite cellular functions . They can either cooperate in a cellular process or work in opposition on the same process . For this reason PKC isozymes present a challenging area of research . For instance , many investigators have studied the substrates of PKC and their role in different biological processes . 1 . 6 . 2 Activation of PKCs In their unstimulated state / inactive conformation , most PKC isoforms reside in the cytosol . Figure 9 shows the pathway for PKC activation . Ligand receptor binding at the plasma membrane causes G protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) or receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) to activate phospholipase C ( PLC ) and hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) to form IP3 ( inositol 1 , 4 , 5 triphosphate ) and DAG . IP3 causes intracellular Ca 2 + predominantly located in membranes of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to be released into the cytosol . Ca 2 + and DAG bind to PKC to fully activate it , as well as to translocate it to the membrane . This results in PKC being transformed into an active enzyme [ 29 ] . Upon activation , PKC modifes various cellular functions by phosphorylating its target substrates . Phorbol esters , such as PMA , act as a substitute for DAG in stimulating classical and novel PKC isoforms . Unlike DAG , phorbol esters are not readily metabolized , and treatment of cells with these molecules results in prolonged activation of protein kinase C [ 30 ] . Thus , they are widely used to study the effects of PKC subfamily members on cellular functions . PMA treatment has been also shown to induce time dependent depletion of PKC isoforms . 18 Figure 9 . Schematic representation of PKC activation . Adapted with permission from [ 31 ] . 1 . 6 . 3 Maturation of PKCs The maturation of PKCs depends on a highly regulated phosphorylation process , and they must be completely phosphorylated in order to be ‘primed’ or activation competent . Transphosphorylation by the upstream kinase , phosphoinositide - dependent kinase ( PDK1 ) occurs at a site in activation loop , as shown in Figure 10 [ 32 ] . This is followed by phosphorylation of two sites in the carboxyl domain of the kinase [ 33 ] . Phosphorylation at the turn motif is required to maintain the catalytic competence of the enzyme . Phosphorylation at the hydrophobic motif does not account for the enzymatic activity but it affects the subcellular 19 localization and stability of PKC [ 34 ] . The hydrophobic motif also serves another purpose . It provides a docking site for PDK1 [ 35 ] . Figure 10 . Priming of PKC into an inactive but mature conformation [ 32 ] . In addition to the two conformations , i . e . autoinhibited but activation - competent ( ‘primed’ ) and immature , described above , Swanson and coworkers have proposed that PKC can be activated in two independent ways : 1 ) through disruption of pseudosubstrate docking or 2 ) through stabilization of the homodimer ( Figure 11 ) . ‘Dimeric’ forms are mature kinases , like the ‘primed’ forms , but they have prolonged residence time in membranes [ 36 ] . 20 Figure 11 . PKC dimer . The dimeric form has the regulatory domain sequestered and is believed to be more active and stable than the active kinase forms [ 36 ] . Form I , II and III show the model for dimer formation . Form I shows regulatory domains of two PKC α molecules interacting with each other . Form II shows the interactions between regulatory domain and catalytic domain of two PKC molecules , which finally leads to the formation of the homodimer , form III . 1 . 6 . 4 Downregulation and degradation Prolonged activation of PKC , as occurs when cells are treated with phorbol esters , results in degradation of the enzyme . In the literature , this ‘downregulation’ effect was often used to show that a process was dependent on PKC . When the enzymes are in their enzymatically active and membrane bound conformation , they are more prone to dephosphorylation and eventually to degradation . Dephosphorylation of either of the two C - terminal sites causes a rapid dephosphorylation of the other site as well . The first dephosphorylation event appears to be inactivating , because it affects the conformation and shunts PKC to a compartment where it can be degraded . It is catalyzed by the hydrophobic motif phosphatase , the PH domain Leucine - rich repeat Protein Phosphatase ( PHLPP ) . Interestingly , there is a “rescue” pathway , by which the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) is recruited to the dephosphorylated turn motif , stabilizing PKC and promoting its rephosphorylation [ 27 ] . A summary of activation and 21 downregulation of protein kinase C is shown in Figure 12 . The scheme of Figure 12 was drawn up without consideration for the dimer form of mature enzymes . Figure 12 . Model showing life cycle of PKC [ 27 ] . Pink balls represent phosphate groups added to three phosphorylation sites . DG stands for Diacylglycerol , HSP70 stands for heat shock protein 70 , PHLPP stands for PH domain and Leucine rich repeat protein phosphatases . 1 . 6 . 5 PKC receptors and localization of isozymes Each PKC subfamily can have specific functions as they are differentially distributed in tissues and also have different set of activators and substrates that they recognize . The situation is complicated even further because there are two different types of receptors involved in translocation of PKCs from cytosol to different compartments of cell : Intracellular receptors for 22 inactivated kinases ( RICKs ) and intracellular receptors for activated kinases ( RACKs ) . PKC activators should cause the release of PKC from RICKs . PKC in an active conformation binds to RACKs . Binding to a specific RACK localizes each PKC isoform next to their substrates or other adaptor proteins and can favor phosphorylation of relevant substrates . RACK1 was found to bind PKCßII but is probably a scaffold for all PKCs , and RACK2 ( ß’Cop ) is selective for PKC ε . The N - terminal regulatory domain of PKC mediates the interaction between PKC and RACKs [ 37 ] . 1 . 6 . 6 PKC substrates PKC phosphorylates various target proteins . Some of the PKC substrates have a well - known role in cell motility and morphology , and these are discussed here . MARCKS is a ubiquitously distributed PKC substrate . MARCKS proteins are thought to be involved in brain development and postnatal survival , cell migration and adhesion , and actin reorganization [ 38 ] . MARCKS is mainly known as an actin - binding , calmodulin - binding and PIP2 - binding protein . These functions are inhibited by PKC - mediated phosphorylation . A very small portion of the protein , only 25 amino acids , makes up the sequence called the effector domain ( ED ) or phosphosite domain ( PSD ) . This segment has three PKC phosphoryation sites and mediates functions such as interaction with plasma membrane , calcium - calmodulin , and actin . MARCKS binds to the plasma membrane via insertion of its N - terminal myristoyl moiety into the bilayer and interaction of basic residues in ED with acidic lipids , particularly PIP2 [ 39 , 40 ] . When MARCKS is phosphorylated by PKC , negative charge is introduced into the ED causing it to dislodge from the PIP2 raft . Calcium - calmodulin binding with MARCKS also causes its translocation from membrane to the cytoplasm . Translocation of MARCKS releases inhibition 23 and causes PLC to hydrolyze PIP2 to produce inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate and DAG . The ED has multiple serine residues , which are phosphorylated by PKC in rat brain , namely S152 , S156 and S163 [ 41 ] . Depending on the species , the number of phosphorylatable serines can vary . Both cPKC and nPKC can phosphorylate MARCKS [ 42 ] . Figure 13 . MARCKS structure showing different domains and PKC phosphorylation sites . Modified from [ 43 ] . Vasodilator - st imulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) is a member of the Ena / VASP protein family . They are actin - associated protein s involved in cytoskeleton remodeling . PKC α phosphorylates VASP at S157 [ 44 ] . Ena / VASP is also linked to the process of filopodia formation . P hosphorylation of VASP at S157 is import ant for actin polymerization [ 45 ] . Three ad ditional actin - binding proteins are substrates of PKC and possibly , candidates for mediating an effect on filopodia . Growth a ssociated protein ( GAP43 ) or n euromodulin is a protein with an effector domai n and N - terminal palmitoylation . It belongs to the same protein family as MARCKS and can be phosphorylated both by cPKC and nPKC like MARCKS . Dissociation of MARCKS and GAP43 upon phosphorylation by PKC increases the availability of PIP2 for other proteins [ 24 ] . Adducin caps the barbed en d of F - actin and links it to spectrin . This stabilizes the actin filaments . Phosphorylation of adducin by PKC has been linked to a 24 decrease in its function in F - actin capping and spectrin - actin binding [ 46 ] . Adducin is also a calmodulin - binding protein . Fascin is an actin - bund ling protein important in actin - based protrusions like filopodia . When fascin is phosphorylated by PKC it loses its actin crosslinki ng function , leading to diffuse localization of fascin [ 24 ] . It has been shown that fascin is phosphorylated at S39 by PKC α [ 47 ] . 1 . 7 PKC and cancer PKC isoforms are activated by tumor promoters , i . e . phorbol esters , which suggests that PKC has an important role in cancer . Overexpression of various PKC isoforms in different types of cancer supports that PKCs are involved in carcinogenesis . During cancer cell proliferation and survival , PKC isozymes stimulate survival or proliferation - associated signaling pathways , such as Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK or PI3K / Akt ( also known as PKB ) / mTOR pathways , but suppress the expression of cancer suppressor - associated or apoptotic signals . In cancer , PKC isozymes play a critical role in cell proliferation , survival , invasion , migration , apoptosis , angiogenesis , and anticancer drug resistance [ 37 ] . The specific effects of PKC activation on epithelial cell spreading and migration have been investigated in the context of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and tumor carcinogenesis [ 48 , 49 ] . The activation of one or more isozymes could account for the transition between different types of actin architecture [ 50 ] . 1 . 8 Phorbol esters and cytoskeleton The tumor promoting function is characteristic of some of the phorbol esters , tetracyclic diterpenoids . Phorbol esters are of great interest to studies of the cytoskeletal changes in the cells . PMA substitutes for the lipid second messenger , DAG , which is produced from the 25 hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate by phospholipase C . Phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate is the most commonly used phorbol ester . PMA are found to be effective at nanomolar concentration . Several studies have reported a rapid reorganization of the cytoskeleton when cultured cells are exposed to the phorbol esters such as PMA . In 1984 , Schliwa and coworkers reported that a potent tumor promoter induces a rapid but reversible redistribution of actin and vinculin [ 51 ] . Kellie and coworkers observed that PMA induced a rapid morphological change in MDCK cells from flat , cuboidal to round or elongated [ 52 ] . Since phorbol esters are the activators of cPKC and nPKC , the PMA - induced effect in actin reorganization is believed to be via PKC activity . PMA is known to cause transient loss of filopodia in 1000W cells . 1 . 9 PTPs PTPs are enzymes that remove the phosphate group from the phosphorylated tyrosine residue of one or more proteins . Some of the phosphatases are found to be positive or negative regulators in many cellular processes including cytoskeleton rearrangement , proliferation , differentiation etc . PTP1B ( PTP non - receptor type 1 ) is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic protein that regulates insulin signaling . PTP1B , by its two proline - rich motifs binds to SH3 domains of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family . This binding leads to dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory Tyr site in Src family causing activation of the kinase . Now , the activated Src proteins further activate Rac1 GTPase ultimately increasing the membrane ruffles . Conversely , a PTP1B mutant cell cannot activate Src and thus , it fails to activate the Rac - dependent pathway and no changes in actin organization occur [ 53 ] . PTP1B causes change in actin organization by binding to and dephosphorylating the insulin receptor [ 54 ] . Pathre and coworkers have reported that PTP1B is localized to adherens junctions and focal adhesion 26 complexes . It seems to modulate integrin - mediated adhesion via regulation of Src activation [ 55 ] . In case of TC - PTP ( PTP non - receptor type 2 ) , it dephosphorylates the positive regulatory Tyr site in Src rendering the inactivation of the Src kinase family ( 2 ) . TC - PTP lacks the proline rich domain that causes the differential substrate specificity between PTP1B and TC - PTP , however . TC - PTP shares 72 % catalytic domain similarity with PTP1B [ 56 ] . 1 . 10 Objectives of the current study The main objective of my study is to investigate the role of PKC isoforms in regulation of filopodia dynamics . The Heckman laboratory found that oncogenic transformation of cells lead to loss of filopodia . To assume that the filopodia are affected by PKC activation in such a way that actin arrays were disassembled , however , I would have to assume that PKC was the only target of PMA . I thought that PMA - mediated loss of filopodia occurs downstream of PKC activity . My purpose was to block PKC activity and observe its effect on filopodia prevalance . Another aim was to determine the role of PTP inhibitors on filopodia regulation . There are many filopodial protein involved in formation and elongation of filopodia . We assumed that these proteins might be inactive upon dephosphorylation by PTPs . If we could block these PTPs , filopodial proteins or actin - associated proteins might remain active for a longer span contributing in the formation and elongation process . 27 CHAPTER 2 . MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 Cell culture and chemicals The 1000 W cell line was generated by treatment of a heterotopic tracheal transplant from a Fisher rat with 7 , 12 - dimethylbenz ( a ) anthracene ; the cells were maintained in WIHC , a modified Waymouth ' s medium ( Sigma - Aldrich Technologies , St . Louis , MO ) containing penicillin , streptomycin , 10 % FBS ( fetal bovine serum , Hyclone , UT or Atlanta Biologicals , GA ) supplemented with 0 . 1 µg / ml insulin and 0 . 1 µg / ml hydrocortisone . The cells were incubated in 37° C and 5 % CO2 in air . Cells were regularly fed and were subcultured after becoming confluent . For passaging the cells , a calcium - and magnesium - free Hanks balanced salt solution ( CMF - HBSS ) with trypsin and EDTA was used . CMF - HBSS EDTA solution was prepared by adding 0 . 875 g Na - EDTA to 50 ml of 10X CMF - HBSS ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) , and the final volume was made up to 437 . 5 ml by adding deionized water . A speck of phenol red , pH indicator ( Matheson , Cincinnati , OH ) , was added . To adjust the pH , 1N NaOH was added until the liquid turned a cherry red color . Then the solution was autoclaved and dispensed in five bottles each containing 87 . 5 ml volume . The trypsin working solution was prepared by adding 12 . 5 ml of a solution of [ 0 . 5 % trypsin + 5 . 3mM EDTA ] ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) to 87 . 5 ml of CMF - HBSS EDTA solution . All solutions were tested for sterility before using them on cultures . For experiments , cells were detached from culture dishes with a trypsin - EDTA solution and subcultured at a concentration of 2 x 10 5 per 35 mm petri dish . Each dish contained a sterile germanium - coated substrate . The cultures were left overnight to become attached and treatment was begun within 21 hours after subculture . The procedures were completed as described in sections 2 . 4 and 2 . 5 . 28 3 % paraformaldehyde in cytoskeletal buffer was prepared for fixing the cells . Cytoskeletal buffer was prepared at a pH of 6 . 2 using 150 mM potassium chloride , 5 nM magnesium chloride , 5 mM EGTA , and 5 mM 4 - morpholineethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) sodium salt in deionized water . To prepare 3 % paraformaldehyde , 3g of formaldehyde was weighed and added to 100 ml of cytoskeletal buffer . The mixture was continuously stirred with magnetic stirrer . After 30 minutes , 1 M NaOH was added to the solution dropwise until the solution turned clear . The pH was also regularly checked so that it stays at or below 7 . 4 . The fixative solution was warmed to 37° C before use . Phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . The stock solution was stored at - 70° C until added to the cultured cells . An intermediate stock of 1 : 10 was made in ethanol , and an aliquot of this stock was added directly to the culture medium keeping the final concentration at 2 nM . The exposure time for all the experiments was 30 minutes . 2 . 2 Preparation of germanium substrates for cell culture Round glass coverslips of 25mm diameter and thickness # 1 ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) were coated with germanium to prepare substrates for cell culture . The coverslips were cleaned before coating with germanium . First , they were soaked in 1 N HCL overnight followed by rinsing thoroughly with deionized water . Then the coverslips were washed in 70 % ethanol for at least an hour and air - dried . A Denton BTT - IV high vacuum evaporator was used for the coating process . Six clean coverslips were mounted on a rotating table in the coater and 0 . 02g weight of Ge ( Structure Probe , Inc . West Chester , PA ) , placed in a tungsten basket , was evaporated at a resistive current of 9 amps for 2 minutes . Vacuum inside the 29 coater was 2 X 10 - 5 torr . The tungsten basket was positioned at a distance of 4 cm and a height of 1 . 5 cm from the coverslips being coated . These coverslips were sterilized before using them for cell culture . Coverslips were irradiated with UV for at least 30 minutes each side . Once sterile , substrates were placed in 35mm Petri dishes with the coated side facing up . 2 . 3 Peptide design Peptides were designed based on the phosphorylation sites and functionality of PKC and MARCKS . Peptides were synthesized by Peptide 2 . 0 ( Chantilly , VA ) . The peptides were reconstituted with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , pH 6 . Table 1 shows the amino acid sequences of all the peptides that I used in my experiments . After the course of experimentation was completed , the peptides were checked by MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry to ensure that they had not become degraded on account of being subjected to repeat freeze - thaw cycles ( data not shown ) . The only indication of degradation found was in the oldest sample of PKC ε peptide ( 726 - 737 ) . Therefore , samples treated with tubes having a high content of intact peptide were used in the data compilation , and the others were omitted . 30 Table 1 : Peptides designed to block PKC activity Peptide ID Amino acid Sequence Residues Number PKC α EGFSYVNPQFVH 654 - 665 PKC δ KGFSFVNPKYEQ 659 - 670 PKC η RNFSYVSPELQP 672 - 683 PKC ε KGFSYFGEDLMP 726 - 737 MARCKS 152 - 163 SFKKSFKLSGFS 152 - 163 MARCKS 162 - 173 FSFKKSKKEAGE 162 - 173 2 . 4 BioPORTER mediated peptide delivery BioPORTER reagent ( Genlantis , San Diego , CA ) was prepared as mentioned in the manufacturer’s datasheet . This reagent is a lipid formulation that transports the peptide or protein of interest directly to the cytoplasm of the cell . BioPORTER - mediated transfection of protein has proved to be effective for the study of protein - protein interactions as an alternative to using nucleic constructs . It is also found to be non - cytotoxic to 1000W cells [ 57 ] . BioPORTER is thought to work by two mechanisms as shown in Figure 14 . 31 Figure 14 . BioPORTER mediated peptide delivery . BioPORTER / protein complexes fuse with plasma membrane and release protein into the cytoplasm ( 1 ) or the complexes are endocytosed and then fuse with endosome and release the protein of interest in the cytoplasm ( 2 ) . Cells cultured in 35 - mm tissue culture dishes containing sterile germanium substrate and 1 . 2ml of WIHC , were incubated as described above to allow the attachment on the substrate . After the cells were properly attached , they were serum - deprived before treating them with peptides . The serum - replete WIHC medium in each dish was replaced with 1 . 2 ml serum - free WIHC . In the meantime , the BioPORTER was mixed with peptide . The mixture was allowed to sit in room temperature for at least 5 minutes while the lipid complex formed . Tube containing dry film of BioPORTER reagent was made up in 250 µ l of chloroform and vortexed . The reagent was aliquoted in 50 microfuge tubes each containing 5 µ l solution . The microfuge tubes containing 5 µ l of BioPORTER solution was left under a laminar flow hood to evaporate the 32 solvent for at least 2 hours . In a tube containing dry BioPORTER 7 µ l of peptide was added . The mixture was pipetted up and down 5 times and vortexed gently . 6 µ l of BioPORTER - peptide mix was added to each dish . After 8 hours of incubation , 0 . 9 ml of 20 % FBS - supplemented medium was added to the dishes to restore the serum concentration and the cultures were incubated for another 20 hours . After that , one set of dishes was treated with PMA ( final concentration 2nM ) and all the dishes were fixed with warm 3 % paraformaldehyde ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 10 minutes . The dishes were rinsed with sterile PBS and then immersed in PBS until ready for the observation . 2 . 5 Treatment with transcription inhibitors and A23187 In experiments with inhibitors along with PMA , actinomycin D and α - amanitin were added to a serum - medium at final concentrations of 0 . 4 and 0 . 5 µM respectively . The cultures were incubated for 20 hours and PMA treated for 30 minutes . Cells were fixed and left in PBS until ready for observation . In experiment with calcium ionophore , A23187 and PMA , both reagents were added simultaneously and incubated for 30 minutes and then fixed as mentioned above . 2 . 6 Treatment with PTP inhibitors PTP inhibitors were used at two concentrations , representing the IC50 and 3 times the IC50 . PTP inhibitors used in my studies were generously provided by Dr . Zhong - Yin Zhang and were directed against PTP1B , TC - PTP , and PTP - MEG2 . After culturing cells on suitable substrates ( germanium ) and incubating them as described above , PTP inhibitors were added to the respective dishes . PMA was added to one set of the dishes for 30 minutes . Fixation and 33 rinsing with PBS was done as mentioned earlier . Coverslips were immersed in PBS until ready for the observation . 2 . 7 Cell periphery analysis The dishes were stored in PBS at 4° until they were analyzed . When ready to see the samples , I removed each coverslip from the dish and mounted it on a glass slide cleaned with ethanol . The coverslip was inverted on a drop of PBS placed on the slide . The edge of the coverslip was sealed with the transparent nail polish . After the edge was dry , the sample was observed by phase contrast microscopy in a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence light microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc ) using the Plan - Neofluar 100x / 1 . 30 oil objective lens ( Carl Zeiss , Inc ) . The samples were observed in a raster pattern and 60 - 150 cells were scored . Only the single cells , which were not rounded , were scored . I noted the percentage of the cell periphery occupied with filopodia . The assigned values were in the range of 0 to 100 in a multiple of 5 . Cells without a substantial number of filopodia were assigned 0 % . The two variables measured were : % periphery coverage with filopodia and percentage of cells showing filopodia out of total cells . 2 . 8 Statistical analysis There were three observers for most of the experiments and they made the observations independently . Fixed rules were set before analyzing cell periphery to minimize the variance . For experiments done only once , the mean of three observers’ count was plotted along with the standard error of the counts . For experiments with one or more replicates the mean of the experimental means was plotted along with the standard error of the means . All the calculations 34 and statistical analysis were done using Excel , except the t - tests , which were done with GraphPad . 35 CHAPTER 3 . RESULTS 3 . 1 Treatment with peptides blocking PKC and MARCKS : coverage analysis It was my hypothesis that parallel arrays of actin filaments are affected by PKC activation in such a way that the array is disassembled . Thus , I expect to see more filopodia on the cells when the PKC activity is blocked . The initial experiments were done to inhibit PKC or the common substrate of PKCs , MARCKS . I measured the endpoint , percentage of the cell perimeter covered with filopodia . I used the PKC α peptide to represent the conventional PKCs , as well as peptides representing the PKC δ , PKC η , and PKC ε sequences and the MARCKS ED sequence . The results of replicated experiments are shown in Figure 14 . The mean values for all samples , that underwent peptide introduction , were similar to the control with protein introduction alone . In the cells treated with MARCKS 152 - 163 , there appeared to be a slight depression of the percent coverage of the perimeter with filopodia . This depression could have been caused by competition with full - length MARCKS for binding sites on the membrane , so it was not investigated further . An analysis was also conducted for filopodia destroyed with PMA in populations treated with peptides constructed from the C - terminal sequences of PKC α , δ , η , and ε ( Figure 15 ) . This confirms that , as mentioned in Introduction , the filopodia are disassembled by PMA . The differences observed in samples treated with PKC δ and ε peptides suggested that these peptides had a slight effect counteracting disassembly . The same was true of MARCKS 162 - 173 , but the variance of the means was relatively high . In summary , I can say that peptides when introduced alone did not cause any changes in the filopodia coverage whereas , when these peptide - treated samples were exposed to PMA for 30 minutes , a limited rescue effect could be seen . Comparable data are also presented in the form of difference relative to control , in order to visualize the 36 variability in values from one experiment to another . I also combined the results with another experiment in which only one sample was a replicate of the above experiments . This time I analyzed the differences as the percent coverage of the perimeter with filopodia of those cells that showed filopodia ( Table 2 ) . This reveals whether those cells that made filopodia were forced to make more by the treatment . Because the value for a single sample with an irrelevant protein introduced was subtracted from each treated sample in the analysis , the values can either be elevated or reduced relative to control . Most of the differences were small but some were consistent in direction , suggesting an elevation by treatment with PKC δ and ε peptides in coverage by filopodia of those cells that showed filopodia . The same was true of MARCKS 162 - 173 . All three of these treatments caused only positive changes over control in repeated experiments ( Table 2 ) . The implication is that the cell’s ability to make filopodia was also affected by these three treatments , if they already were able to make them . 37 Figure 15 .

The data in Table 3 shows the differences over control for all the samples . The numbers in different experiments are quite variable . Nothing stands out as a difference over control , but , as mentioned above , the results mean that cells making filopodia have slightly increased their coverage over control for PKC ε and MARCK 162 - 173 . 39 Table 3 .

This was done to further test whether the number of cells showing filopodia or the number of filopodia per cells was affect in different peptide treatments with and without PMA . Figure 16 gives one the same impression as the estimate of coverage shown in Figure 15 . The mean values for all treated samples were similar to the control with protein introduction alone except for PKC η and PKC ε , which showed a slight elevation over control . On the whole , however , the treatments were ineffective at changing the percentage of cells showing filopodia . In an analysis conducted to study filopodia disassembly , where the samples were all exposed to PMA for 30 minutes , the samples with blocking peptides for PKC ε , PKC δ and MARCKS 162 - 40 173 showed a greater percentage of cells with filopodia than the PMA treated control with irrelevant protein ( Figure 15 ) . As already mentioned , the variance of the means was relatively high . The data suggest that several treatments may “rescue” the filopodia from destruction , namely PKC δ , MARCKS 162 - 173 and PKC ε , but all of these effects fall short of statistical significance . Figure 16 . Mean percentage of cells showing filopodia after treating samples with PKC and MARCKS blocking peptides in presence and absence of PMA . Error bars represent ± one standard error of the mean of two replicates . 0 20 40 60 80 100 % o f ce ll s s ho w i ng f il opod i a PMA untreated PMA treated 41 The data for percentage of cells showing filopodia are also presented as a difference relative to the controls . These results are shown in Table 4 for samples without PMA treatment and Table 5 for PMA - treated samples . Because the values were normalized to a single sample with an irrelevant protein introduced , the values can all be reduced or elevated because of an unrepresentative control group . This is why the numbers for Experiment A are mainly negative and those for Experiment B are mainly positive in Table 4 . Although the results were highly variable in the experiments , the table gives one the same impression as Figure 15 . In PMA untreated samples , PKC η and PKC ε have a greater percentage of cells with filopodia than the control . In the samples treated with PKC δ and MARCKS 152 - 163 , the percentage of cells showing filopodia is lower than the control . Thus , more cells in the PKC η and PKC ε samples entered the population able to display filopodia . Taken together , the results suggest that the effects of introducing the blocking peptides are small but may be consistent for different aspects of filopodia prevalence in samples untreated with PMA . 42 Table 4 .

The sample with PKC α and possibly that with PKC η , showed values lower than the PMA - treated control . MARCKS 152 - 163 seems to have no effect at all ( Table 5 ) . 43 Table 5 .

Therefore , one possible explanation of the results was that the PKC δ peptide competed for the binding partner of the PKC ε protein . The more likely target would have the least variance , so I used PKC ε blocking peptide in replicate experiments . When all the experiments with PKC ε peptide were averaged , including those where the other isoforms were not tested , the experimental variability was high as indicated by the size of the error bars ( Figure 17 ) . This was explained by the inter - experiment variability , as the coverage of the cell perimeter with filopodia varied from less than 5 % to over 20 % in the samples that had had an irrelevant protein introduced . Therefore , I normalized the coverage values of peptide - treated samples to those of the control treated with irrelevant protein . The data are plotted in Figure 18 along with the t - test results ( Table 6 ) . The figure shows that 44 the PKC ε hydrophobic segment rescued filopodia , and therefore , PKC ε was able to disassemble filopodia . Figure 17 .

The difference in the test result suggests that this difference also reflects the change in the PKC ε treated cells . 47 Figure 19 .

Thus , the effects of the PKC ε peptide were attributed the number of cells capable of making filopodia , more than the amount of filopodia made by the cells . The role of the hydrophobic segment peptide could be : 1 ) to block PDK approaching PKC ε for phosphorylation at the activation loop , 2 ) to block PKC - mediated autophosphorylation of the bona fide hydrophobic segment , 3 ) to block PKC ε docking at a site to which it binds via the hydrophobic segment , or 4 ) to block recycling of PKC ε after dephosphorylation . It appeared from this analysis that the difference between PKC ε peptide introduction and irrelevant protein in the PMA - untreated cells could be significant . However , the difference could not be tested because the values were normalized to the values of controls with irrelevant protein . By normalizing the data in a different way , I could test the differences as a 49 ratio to PMA - treated sample with irrelevant protein . This result showed no difference over control ( Figure 20 ) .

Even at 10 h of PMA treatment , filopodia were not found to reappear . In the course of my experiments , however , I found that conditions could be changed to enable PMA to favor filopodia formation . The reversal of the usual effect was most dramatic when the cells were treated with PMA and calcium ionophore , A23187 . I think the elevated level of calcium ions in the cell may cause PMA to regulate filopodia formation in a positive manner . Inclusion of transcriptional inhibitors in the medium over the time of peptide exposure had a similar effect ( Figure 21 ) . I speculate that these inhibitors inhibit the synthesis of some proteins that negatively regulates filopodia formation . MARCKS 162 and PKC δ further synergized the PMA - induced enhancement , but PKC ε peptide counteracted the effect . This is seen in case of both variables , i . e . periphery coverage with filopodia ( Figure 22 ) and percentage of cells showing filopodia ( Figure 23 ) . 51 Figure 21 .

Therefore , I investigated the role of different other protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors on filopodia dynamics . I chose three phosphatase inhibitors ; one for PTP non - receptor type 1 ( also called PTP1B ) , the second for PTP non - receptor type 2 ( TC - PTP ) , and the third for PTP non - receptor type 9 ( PTP - MEG2 ) . These inhibitors were added to the cell culture at IC50 ( half maximal inhibitory concentration ) and 3 times the IC50 . The effect of these inhibitors is summarized in Figure 24 . It seems PTP1B inhibitor at 3 times IC50 concentration is favoring filopodia assembly in both PMA untreated and PMA treated conditions . However at IC50 , there were more filopodia in the cells treated with PTP1B inhibitor than in the untreated control . This result suggests that there is a process of dissolution , possibly related to FC ( focal complex ) turnover that can be prevented by the PTP1B inhibitor . Comparable data for PTP - MEG2 inhibitor treatments failed to show any distinction between the PMA - treated and untreated samples . When cells are exposed to TC - PTP inhibitors at 3 times the IC50 concentration , filopodia rescue can be observed . This is specific to the effect of PMA , because the effect is not pertinent to the cells not treated with PMA . Those cells show the same amount of coverage in the presence and absence of the TC - PTP inhibitor ( Figure 24 ) . When another variable , percentage of cells showing filopodia , is plotted , it gives one the same impression as Figure 24 ( see Figure 25 ) . Here , both treatment with PTP1B inhibitor at 3 times the IC50 and TC - PTP inhibitor at 3 times the IC50 seem to favor filopodia assembly . In these treatment conditions , a greater percentage of cells in a population are showing filopodia . 55 Figure 24 .

DISCUSSION 4 . 1 Findings and their implications for PKC activation The blocking peptide assay can be used to determine whether a specific protein is implicated in the cellular mechanism of interest . The assay uses a synthetic peptide homologous to a specific domain of the protein and tests whether it affects a cellular function . When administered to the cells , the synthetic peptide competes with the endogenous protein and blocks the downstream signaling pathway . The aim of my study was to investigate the role of PKC isoforms in regulation of filopodia dynamics . If these proteins are involved , do the different isoforms act upon filopodia in the same way ? I hypothesized that the effect of PMA was mediated by PKC . Unlike the conventional isoforms , PKC ε is regulated by phosphorylation on the hydrophobic segment . In the other isoforms examined , this phosphorylation is constitutive [ 59 ] , but all dephosphorylated isoforms are subject to a recycling pathway ( see Figure 12 ) . Therefore , I would detect a difference between the effects of peptides for the respective hydrophobic sequences . I used the blocking peptides against two proteins , PKC and MARCKS . PKC blocking peptides were homologous to the hydrophobic motif of the protein , which is one of three “priming” phosphorylation sites needed for its maturation . As mentioned in the introduction , phosphorylation at the hydrophobic site accounts for the stability of the enzyme . Unphosphorylated or dephosphorylated proteins are more prone to degradation [ 27 ] . When one hinders this phosphorylation step , the protein remains inactive . Two different MARCKS peptides representing phosphorylation sites for PKC were also chosen to test if PKC - mediated regulation of filopodia is via MARCKS . There can be two ways by which the filopodia were reduced in the cell population . Filopodia formation is inhibited somehow or the filopodia get dissolved . The main conclusion from my experiments was that the 58 synthetic peptides failed to affect filopodia dynamics in cells not treated with PMA , but they rescued filopodia after the PMA treatment . PMA is a surrogate of diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , hence PKC is activated when PMA binds at the DAG binding site . This process regulates numerous signaling pathways and cellular functions . It is difficult to study the role of PKC because this family consists of three different classes of isoforms , which are differently expressed and regulated . Each of these proteins might have different functions or redundant functions . A study by Gilio and coworkers shows that cPKC and nPKC involved in platelet activation have opposite roles in the process . They showed that cPKCs promoted thrombus formation on collagen whereas nPKCs inhibited this process [ 60 ] . PKC δ and PKC ε , belonging to the same class of isoforms , are also reported to have opposing roles in regulating cell apoptosis , survival and proliferation . PKC ε enhanced cell proliferation and survival unlike PKC δ . PKC α is also known to be anti - proliferative [ 61 ] . The divergence in the function of these isoforms is due to the subcellular distribution of these enzymes and their binding partners , but it is also likely that any one may be represented in a cell type in the absence of the other . The periphery of cells covered with filopodia and the number of cells showing filopodia out of the total cell population was used to measure how PKC isoforms are involved in filopodia regulation . Upon completion of this research , I found that : i ) PKC ε , PKC δ and MARCKS 162 - 173 peptide could rescue filopodia from dissolution , ii ) the effect of PMA could be reversed if it was given with calcium ionophore , A23187 , or transcriptional inhibitors ( α - amanitin and actinomycin D ) . The only samples that were subjected to statistical tests were those treated with PKC ε peptide in the presence and absence of PMA , however . The results suggested that PKC ε acts as a predator which hunts for the prey i . e . actin . A past study by Li and coworkers had suggested that PKC ε negatively regulates actin cables or stress fibers [ 62 ] . If one succeeds in 59 blocking this predator , one might save actin bundles from getting dissolved . If one introduced peptides that blocked the processes of PKC activation and substrate phosphorylation , all the actin - binding proteins downstream of PKC may be inhibited , and as a result , actin bundles would not disassemble . Because all the other isoforms of cPKC and nPKC still become activated after PMA , the effect seen with any one blocking peptide was expected to be small . Moreover , the peptides might only prevent a fraction of the total PKC isoform in the cell from being phosphorylated , as the majority of the PKC molecules may already be phosphorylated . The only molecules that could be affected were those that were unphosphorylated at the time of treatment . What could be the mechanism by which PKC ε dissolves them , and how is it related to the pathway of formation ? First , I discuss the mechanisms of formation . One constituent of filopodia that is a well - known target of PKC - mediated phosphorylation is fascin . Hashimoto and coworkers showed that fascin depletion caused the loss of filopodia , which implies that fascin is important for bundling actin filaments in filopodia . They say both the actin - bundling and PKC - binding activities of fascin are important for the filopodial organization [ 63 ] . Fascin has N and C terminal actin binding sites and its actin cross - linking activity is inhibited by PKC phosphorylation at serine39 ( in human fascin ) . S39 lies within the N - terminal actin binding site of fascin [ 64 ] . Phosphorylation of this residue in cultured cells is found to affect filopodia formation and cell migration [ 47 ] . However , other results showing that the unphosphorylatable mutation S52A and phosphomimetic mutation at site S52D or S52E was able to rescue actin bundling as well as wild type [ 65 ] . The N - terminal actin binding site phosphorylation is on S39 in human and S52 in Drosophila fascin . Zanet and coworkers also identified a different regulatory residue in the C - terminal actin binding site of fascin ( S289 ) . The S289A mutation in fascin disrupted the actin bundling capacity in Drosophila but still rescued filopodia formation 60 [ 66 ] . This result suggests that fascin contributes to actin bundle formation even if it loses one of its actin - binding sites . Hence , it is possible that the PKC - mediated dissolution of filopodia is due to the phosphorylation of fascin . Another constituent required for filopodia formation is Ena / VASP . Linkage of Ena / VASP to the barbed end of F - actin increases monomeric actin addition and inhibits addition of capping protein [ 67 , 68 ] . VASP is phosphorylated on S157 by PKC in response to phorbol ester [ 69 ] . This might also be the step affected by the PKC ε peptide , resulting in the interruption of the filopodia assembly process . Further work must be done to test if cPKC contributes to filopodia formation in a different way from PKC ε . There are other mechanisms known to contribute to filopodia assembly , including : i ) myosin X , which transports components of the filopodia up the actin bundle , ii ) Dia2 , an actin nucleation protein , iii ) ERM , which is another actin - binding protein , iv ) IRSp53 , an I - BAR protein , and v ) TOCA - 1 , a BAR protein . With the exception of ERM , these proteins are not known substrates of PKC . Nevertheless , my experiments on PTP inhibitors showed that a PTP1B inhibitor caused an elevation of the filopodia but failed to rescue the filopodia at the IC50 in PMA - treated cells . This suggested that there are two types or classes of mechanisms regulating the dynamics of the filopodia . Interestingly , I also found that PMA could have the opposite effect of enhancing filopodia prevalence , depending on other cellular conditions , which are further discussed below . Is disassembly simply the lack of assembly ? Mallavarapu and coworker found that filopodium extension and retraction are regulated by a balance between the rate of actin cytoskeleton assembly and retrograde flow . Two processes vary independently of each other . They conclude that the disassembly of filopodia occurs by the lack of assembly of actin monomers [ 70 ] . In addition , actin depolymerizing / severing proteins such as ADF / cofilin , gelsolin also have roles in 61 actin disassembly . 4 . 2 PKC ε and cancer The first experiment performed to understand the effect of overexpression of PKC ε on cancer cells was done by Mischak and coworkers . They showed overexpression of PKC ε contributes to oncogenic transformation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts [ 71 ] . There are many other studies showing that overexpression of PKC ε contributes to oncogenic transformation . Since the overexpression and functions of PKC ε are linked with cancer development and progression , it is considered to be one of the potential targets of medical therapies . Overexpression of PKC ε is linked to numerous types of cancer as shown in Table 8 . Table 8 . Different types of tumor specimen with PKC ε overexpression . Tumor specimen References Bladder [ 72 ] Brain [ 73 ] Breast [ 74 ] Head and neck [ 75 ] Lungs [ 76 ] Prostrate [ 77 ] My current finding that activated PKC ε is responsible for the downregulation of filopodia , an important characteristic of cancer cells , is related to the recent study by Gutierrez - 62 Uzquiza and coworkers . They showed that PKC ε is positively related to the invasiveness property of prostate cancer cells , PC3 - ML cells [ 78 ] . Although PKC ε is not the only isozyme that proved to have a role in oncogenic transformation , it has been linked to malignancy more often than the other isoforms . The experiments done by Baxter and coworkers found it was constitutively active in a small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) cell line [ 79 ] . Similarly , overexpressed PKC ɛ is considered to be oncogenic in rat fibroblasts [ 80 ] and rat colonic epithelial cells [ 81 ] . Cacace and group showed that Raf - 1 / mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) was responsible for the PKC ɛ - induced transformation in rat fibroblasts cells [ 82 ] . We know that Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT ) is a characteristic of cancer cells . It relies on the loss of epithelial properties and gain of mesenchymal properties and leads to the metastasis of the cells . Several studies have shown that PKC ε is involved in regulation of EMT [ 83 ] . Different sets of protein are expressed in epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells . Perhaps , PKC ε has a role in activating some specific protein found in mesenchymal cells . In addition , various cytoskeletal proteins and adhesion proteins are thought to be regulated by PKC ε . For instance , integrin , a transmembrane receptor involved in the formation of focal adhesion plaques , is one of the important interacting partners of PKC . There are some evidences of linkage between β 1 integrin and PKC α [ 84 , 85 ] . Besson and group have suggested that RACK1 mediates the linkage between PKC ε and integrin promoting integrin based adhesion and motility [ 86 ] . Also , it has a unique actin - binding amino acid sequence , LKKQET , at amino acid residues 223 - 228 . This region is exposed only during its open conformation . If the blocking peptide inhibits the phosphorylation of PKC ε and its further activation , it may remain in closed 63 conformation and be unable to bind to F - actin . Another important aspect regarding PKC - mediated actin dissolution involves MARCKS , a widely distributed in vivo PKC substrate . MARCKS has three phosphorylation sites for PKC . In its unphosphorylated form , because of the association of MARCKS with the PIP2 raft and actin , we hypothesize that it could regulate actin remodeling . Hartwig and group reported that MARCKS is an actin filament crosslinking protein , which is inhibited by PKC phosphorylation and by calcium - calmodulin binding [ 87 ] . Yarmola and group believe MARCKS crosslinks actin filaments via two separate actin binding sites in the effector domain [ 88 ] . When MARCKS synthetic peptide corresponding to the effector domain is introduced into the cells , the peptide can compete with the endogenous protein in three possible ways . It might hinder the binding of MARCKS protein to the membrane . Second , it might compete for the phosphorylation by PKC . In this case , unphosphorylated MARCKS protein remains tethered to the membrane and bound with the actin filaments . Perhaps , in both of these cases , MARCKS may help in filopodia formation , and the MARCKS blocking peptides is simply helping to keep actin filaments intact . Third , it also competes for calcium - calmodulin binding . An elevated level of calcium in the cell might cause calcium - calmodulin binding to MARCKS . Tapp and group reported that MARCKS in its natively unfolded state has its actin - binding site inaccessible for binding with actin . The free PSD / ED is capable of binding with actin , calcium - calmodulin and PKC unlike the intact MARCKS . Thus , they suggest a possibility of long intramolecular interaction between the positively charged PSD and rest of the MARCKS domain , which has the opposite charge . Chemical modification such as myristoylation or calpain - mediated cleavage of native MARCKS will make PSD available for interaction with other proteins . In such a case , introduction of only PSD or a part of PSD will be readily available to interact with membrane electrostatically , bind 64 to actin and other proteins . It also has more chance of getting phosphorylated by different kinases than the endogenous MARCKS . This all implies , in presence of MARCKS blocking peptide , the actin filament will be preserved from depolymerization [ 89 ] . When PKC phosphorylates it , MARCKS dissociates from the membrane and remains in cytoplasm as seen in Figure 26 . As a result , it makes PIP2 accessible for other cytoskeletal regulating proteins , especially phospholipase C isoforms . The removal of MARCKS is thought to cause a dramatic reduction in PIP2 content in the membrane [ 90 ] , which would inhibit the organization of actin by PIP2 - associated proteins ( spectrin , α - actinin , FAK , AKT , profilin , vinculin , PLC - delta , PLD1 , and PLD2 , ENaC , PDK1 , ezrin , and WASP ) . All actin - binding proteins remain good candidates as prey for the predator , PKC ε , because their bonding to actin may be perturbed if they have sites phosphorylated by PKC . PKC substrates other than MARCKS , that might have role in filopodia regulation , include GAP43 , which belongs to the same family of proteins as MARCKS and functions similarly . Adducin protects the free barbed end of F - actin at the plasma membrane and links actin filaments with spectrin . Upon PKC - mediated phosphorylation of adducin these functions are lost , and adducin becomes unable to protect F - actin from depolymerizing . The free barbed end of the F - actin can also allow further actin polymerization , however [ 24 ] . Although there is a similar actin - capping function in filopodia formation , it depends on a different protein called capping protein . Nevertheless , actin - binding proteins may be the targets of PKC - mediated effects on filopodia , and several functions may work together to impart a bigger effect on filopodia , as shown in Figure 26 . Hence , we can say that this explanation remains a possibility for understanding PKC’s effect on filopodia dynamics . 65 Another path mediated by mTORC2 in actin cytokeleton reorganization is also shown in Figure 26 [ 91 ] . Figure 26 . Regulation of actin dynamics by phosphorylation of PKC substrates [ 91 ] . 4 . 3 Calcium Ionophore’s effect on filopodia dynamics When 1000W cells are exposed to PMA for 30 minutes , filopodia prevalence decreases . Surprisingly , I found out that when cells are treated with PMA and calcium ionophore , A23187 , filopodia prevalence increases . To my knowledge this is the first time such a phenomenon has been reported . Under normal conditions , cells have very minimal cytoplasmic concentration of calcium ions . When treated with A23187 , the intracellular calcium level gets elevated . So , it seems the level of calcium and PMA together somehow favor more filopodia formation . The mechanism is not known yet . Calcium ions impact many aspects of cell signaling . For instance , calcium binding to the protein changes its conformation and functions . It also affects the localization of proteins . When proteins get bound to Ca 2 + , they get localized to the membrane 66 because of the positive charge of calcium [ 92 ] . We hypothesize that in presence of high Ca 2 + ion , actin remodeling occurred by means of cPKC which bound and was activated by both Ca 2 + and PMA . Elevated calcium means that more cPKC gets activated compared to nPKC in cells treated with PMA and A23187 . More active cPKC may cause more filopodia . There are some previous studies , which mentioned the effect of cytoplasmic - free Ca 2 + on cell shape and actin cytoskeleton [ 93 , 94 ] . It would be useful to study the effect of the Ca 2 + level on actin remodeling in 1000W cells . We can also try sequestering Ca 2 + using a chelating agent such as EGTA and study its effect on actin and / or filopodia dynamics . Furukawa and coworkers showed that the actin cytoskeleton is sensitive to changes in calcium level in the cytoplasm of Dictyostelium but the actual mechanism was not discussed . The result could be mediated either by actin - severing proteins , actin - crosslinking proteins and / or calmodulin - regulated enzymes [ 93 ] . Ca 2 + / calmodulin regulates cell shape by controlling myosin ' s interaction with actin [ 92 ] . Another study by Maus and coworkers showed that cytoplasmic calcium is a regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in B lymphocytes [ 95 ] . Some studies support that an elevation in cytoplasmic calcium has a negative effect on actin cytoskeleton in several cell types [ 96 - 98 ] . These studies are inconsistent with my finding but extensive study can be done to observe how calcium ions regulate filopodia dynamics in our cell line . Expression of several genes is also controlled by cytoplasmic calcium levels because different kinases , phosphatases and other transcription factors involved in this process are sensitive to calcium ions . CAMK ( Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ) , Ca 2 + - dependent PKC isoenzymes , calcineurin ( PP2B ) , PP1 , NF - κ B , STAT3 and CREB are some of the calcium sensitive proteins involved in gene expression [ 99 ] . 67 4 . 4 Effect of transcription inhibitors Actinomycin D and α - amanitin are commonly used transcription inhibitors . α - amanitin binds to RNA polymerase II ( RNAP II ) [ 100 , 101 ] and RNAP III [ 102 ] , RNAP II being more responsive . This blocks the incorporation of new ribonucleotides into the nascent RNA chains [ 103 ] . Actinomycin D works differently . It intercalates into DNA and prevents the progression of RNA polymerases . In this case , RNAP I is more sensitive to actinomycin D [ 104 , 105 ] . When cells were treated with PMA ( 2nM ) and transcriptional inhibitors , the cell shows more filopodia than the control treated with PMA alone . This implies that the general process of F - actin depolymerization caused by PMA was suppressed . The actual mechanism of PMA - induced actin depolymerization is not understood yet but , in presence of these inhibitors , synthesis of a cytoskeletal regulatory protein or PKC substrate may be blocked . If this were the case , cells could not produce actin depolymerizing proteins as a result of which , actin filaments remain intact and we got to see more filopodia than usual . And it may be that the actin genes and other proteins involved in polymerization process are resistant to these inhibitors . 4 . 5 PTP inhibitors and filopodia Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulates many cellular processes including cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration . PTP1B is an endoplasmic reticulum - bound enzyme that is recruited to focal adhesion sites . PTP1B dephosphorylates substrates as Src , EphA3 and other proteins associated to cadherin and integrin complexes . It dephosphorylates receptor tyrosine kinase [ 106 ] . PTP1B is also linked to oncogenesis . PTP1B dephosphorylates Src and enhance its activation . Src has been reported to promote lamellipodia 68 and filopodia formation and stability of actin bundles in filopodia [ 107 ] . Actin associated proteins such as ADF / cofilin need to be maintained in non - phosphorylated active state to perform actin depolymerization . PTPs might also regulate small GTPases and several Rho GTPase targets such as PAK . FAK and paxillin might also get dephosphorylated by PTPs and affect the adhesion complex or actin organization . It seems a filopodia protein or a protein in focal adhesion was dephosphorylated by some types of PTPs making it unable to contribute in formation and elongation of filopodia . When I blocked these proteins from getting dephosphorylated using PTP inhibitor , they were continuously engaged in forming filopodia . This is the opposite of the effect described by others , suggesting that the positive role of PTP1B is to stabilize focal adhesion [ 108 ] . 69 REFERENCES 1 . Mitchison , T . J . and L . P .
