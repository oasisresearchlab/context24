We hypothesise that seropositivity provides more accurate household attack rates than RT - PCR . Here , we investigated the importance of age in household transmission dynamics . Methods : We enroled 112 households ( 291 participants ) in a case - ascertained study in Bergen , Norway from 28th February to 4th April 2020 , collecting demographic and clinical data from index patients and household members . SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c antibodies were measured in sera collected 6 (cid:1) 8 weeks after index patient nasopharyngeal testing to de ﬁ ne household attack rates . Findings : The overall attack rate was 45 % ( 95 % CI 38 (cid:1) 53 ) assessed by serology , and 47 % when also including seronegative RT - PCR positives . Serology identi ﬁ ed a higher number of infected household members than RT - PCR . Attack rates were equally high in children ( 48 % ) and young adults ( 42 % ) . The attack rate was 16 % in asymptomatic household members and 42 % in RT - PCR negative contacts . Older adults had higher antibody titres than younger adults . The risk of household transmission was higher when the index patient had fever ( aOR 3 . 31 [ 95 % CI 1 . 52 (cid:1) 7 . 24 ] ; p = 0 . 003 ) or dyspnoea ( aOR 2 . 25 [ 95 % CI 1 . 80 (cid:1) 4 . 62 ] ; p = 0 . 027 ) during acute illness . Interpretation : Serological assays provide more sensitive and robust estimates of household attack rates than RT - PCR . Children are equally susceptible to infection as young adults . Negative RT - PCR or lack of symptoms are not suf ﬁ cient to rule out infection in household members .

Introduction Since ﬁ rst being identi ﬁ ed in Wuhan , China in December 2019 , the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has rapidly emerged into a global pandemic affecting over 180 coun - tries . As of 10th December 2020 , there were more than 69 million con ﬁ rmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) with over 1 . 5 million deaths globally , and 39 . 768 con ﬁ rmed cases and 382 deaths in Norway ( [ 1 , 2 ] ) . In Norway , reverse transcription polymer - ase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) testing of SARS - CoV - 2 commenced on 23rd January 2020 and the ﬁ rst con ﬁ rmed case was identi ﬁ ed on 26th February 2020 [ 3 ] . Quarantine of suspected cases and isolation of con ﬁ rmed cases was practised from late February . To combat fur - ther spread of the virus in the community , the government imple - mented comprehensive infection control measures on 12th March 2020 [ 4 ] . Current testing for SARS - CoV - 2 relies on ampli ﬁ cation of the viral RNA genome from respiratory specimens , which can generally only be detected during acute infection . Whereas serological assays can determine exposure or infection over a longer time period . Further - more , with a high proportion of asymptomatic and mild illness [ 5 ] , it is highly likely that data restricted to RT - PCR provide an underesti - mate of the infection rate of SARS - CoV - 2 . Research in context Evidence before this study Studies of household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 provide valu - able information about transmission dynamics of the virus . As of 3rd November 2020 , our search in PubMed , medRxiv , bioRxiv and other relevant sources using the terms COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , household secondary attack rate , household transmis - sion , and similar terms , yielded 25 articles out of which ten were relevant . The majority of studies directly targeting house - hold secondary attack rates were conducted in countries with high levels of community transmission . All studies used RT - PCR in the acute phase as the sole diagnostic tool , with attack rates varying from 7 % to 38 % . Children were reported to have the lowest attack rates ( 4 % to 23 . 1 % ) , although the de ﬁ nition of children varied greatly across studies . Older age in household members was consistently reported to be a signi ﬁ cant risk fac - tor for transmission . Household transmission risks have also been indirectly estimated from large serosurveillance studies . These studies were in high community transmission areas and were not speci ﬁ cally designed to estimate the household sec - ondary attack rate , and children were under - represented in the study samples . Added value of this study This case - ascertained study was designed to estimate house - hold attack rates based on the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 spe - ci ﬁ c antibodies in household members of RT - PCR con ﬁ rmed index cases , in a low community spread setting . Households of COVID - 19 patients were consecutively recruited , starting with the ﬁ rst case identi ﬁ ed in Bergen , Norway during the start of the pandemic . We demonstrate that serological assays show higher attack rates than RT - PCR , especially in children . Attack rates were equally high in children and adults . Surprisingly , in household members who were RT - PCR tested when they were symptomatic , the attack rate was as high as 42 % in RT - PCR negatives . In asymptomatic household members , 16 % developed virus speci ﬁ c antibod - ies . Clinical risk factors amongst index cases for household transmission included fever and dyspnoea during acute ill - ness , but not having cough . Implications of all the available evidence Whereas RT - PCR is ideal for the timely diagnosis of COVID - 19 , serological assays are more sensitive in estimating the attack rates in household members of RT - PCR positive cases . Serologi - cal assays can also be used to con ﬁ rm infection in RT - PCR nega - tive and asymptomatic household members . Our results support previous studies showing high attack rates amongst the elderly . Our ﬁ nding of high attack rate amongst children contrasts with previous ﬁ ndings of low prevalence in this age group , and the true infection rate of SARS - CoV - 2 in children requires further investigation . 2 K . Kuwelker et al . / The Lancet Regional Health - Europe 3 ( 2021 ) 100014 The SARS - CoV - 2 is a novel virus in humans , and there are negligi - ble levels of pre - existing antibodies in the population ( [ 6 , 7 ] ) . SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c antibodies appear in the early convalescent phase approximately two weeks after infection and are maintained for at least four months ( [ 8 , 9 ] ) . Therefore , serological assays can provide valuable information on the real infection rate in a community . SARS - CoV - 2 binds to the surface receptors of cells in the respiratory tract through the receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) on its spike protein , and neutralising antibodies prevent infections by blocking viral entry . The household attack rate of SARS - CoV - 2 from index patients to household members re ﬂ ects the natural spread of infection in immu - nologically naive populations with limited preventive measures to control transmission . Respiratory tract infections have been docu - mented to give varying attack rates in families , particularly in in ﬂ u - enza , where previous pandemics have reported attack rates from 4 % to 20 % or higher [ 10 ] . With no pre - existing immunity in the popula - tion , a higher household attack rate would be expected with SARS - CoV - 2 . Previous studies on the household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 have reported attack rates , ranging from 6 % to 38 % , based on RT - PCR of either single or repeated respiratory samples from household members of con ﬁ rmed cases in different study settings [ 11 - 21 ] . How - ever , sensitive serological assays are likely to give more accurate esti - mates of attack rates [ 22 ] , regardless of whether household members are asymptomatic or RT - PCR negative . Here , we estimated the household attack rate of SARS - CoV - 2 and identi ﬁ ed the determinants of household transmission by measuring SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c antibodies in household members of RT - PCR con ﬁ rmed cases during the start of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Nor - way . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Study design , setting and participants A case - ascertained study was conducted in Bergen , Norway . Testing for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs was centralized at Bergen Municipality Emergency Clinic for the city . The main outcome was seroconversion for SARS - CoV - 2 spike antibodies 6 (cid:1) 8 weeks after inclusion . All outpatient RT - PCR con - ﬁ rmed cases ( termed index patient ) tested at the clinic during the ﬁ rst 35 days of the outbreak ( 28th February (cid:1) 4th April 2020 ) , and their household members were eligible for inclusion after written informed consent . Household members were de ﬁ ned as individuals who resided in the same household as an index patient . Index patients and their household members were con - tacted by telephone and asked to participate in the study . In households with > 1 case , the member ﬁ rst diagnosed by RT - PCR was de ﬁ ned as the index patient , and cases with a later date of laboratory con ﬁ rmation ( non - primary cases ) were de ﬁ ned as household members . Households where a case resided alone or no household members were willing to participate in the study , were excluded from the analysis . The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee ( # 118664 ) . 2 . 2 . Clinical information Electronic case report forms ( eCRF ) were developed using RED - Cap (cid:1) ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) ( Vanderbilt University , Nashville , Tennessee ) . The eCRF for index patients contained demo - graphics , COVID - 19 - like symptoms , recent travel history , recent close contact with con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 cases , as well as household size and number of household members that had been ill with similar symptoms . Household members were contacted individually to reg - ister information on gender , age , RT - PCR test result ( if available ) , and COVID - 19 - like symptoms . 2 . 3 . Serological assays Serum samples were collected from index patients and household members 6 (cid:1) 8 weeks after nasopharyngeal sampling of the index patient at Bergen Municipality Emergency Clinic , mainly during the shutdown period with low community transmission . Sera were stored at (cid:1) 80 °C and heat - inactivated for one hour at 56 °C before use in serological assays . 2 . 4 . Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) A two - step ELISA was used for detecting SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c antibodies , initially by screening with receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) and then con ﬁ rming seropositivity by spike IgG [ 6 ] . End - point titres were calculated as the reciprocal of the serum dilu - tion giving an optical density ( OD ) value of 3 standard deviations above the mean of historical pre - pandemic serum samples ( n = 128 ) ( supplementary ﬁ gures 1 and 2 ) . Individuals with titres (cid:1) 100 were de ﬁ ned as positive and those with no antibodies were assigned a titre of 50 for calculation purposes . Since the historical serum samples were de ﬁ ned as seronegative , and recruitment was initiated from the ﬁ rst case in the region , we assume that all participants were seronegative at baseline and the term serocon - version is used to de ﬁ ne attack rate for participants with seropos - itive spike - speci ﬁ c IgG . 3 . Neutralisation assays The neutralisation assays were used to quantify SARS - CoV - 2 - spe - ci ﬁ c functional antibodies . The assays were performed in a certi ﬁ ed Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory using a local clinical isolate hCoV - 19 / Norway / Bergen - 01 / 2020 ( GISAID accession ID EPI _ ISL _ 541 , 970 ) at 2000 tissue culture infectious dose 50 % ( TCID 50 ) / ml . In the micro - neutralisation ( MN ) assay , virus infectivity was measured by detect - ing nucleoprotein after 24 h incubation in Vero cells . The MN titre ( IC 50 ) was determined as the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving 50 % inhibition of virus infectivity . In the virus neutralisation ( VN ) assay , the cytopathic effect ( CPE ) in Vero cells was recorded after 4 (cid:1) 5 days . VN titres were determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution giving no CPE . Negative titres ( < 20 ) were assigned a value of 10 for calculation purpose . 3 . 1 . Statistical methods Risk factors for seroconversion , including household size and characteristics of index patients and household members , were pre - sented as percentages . In univariable analysis , categorical explana - tory variables were assessed by Fisher ’ s exact test and by logistic regression for variables with multiple levels using the level with most observations as reference . Numeric variables , such as antibody titres , were compared by Mann - Whitney test . Multivariable analysis was performed using generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) to account for the potential correlation of outcomes within households . Analyses were performed in R 4 . 0 . 3 ( www . R - project . org ) . Graphs were drawn in Prism 7 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA ) . See Supplementary Methods for further details of inclusion and laboratory methods . 3 . 2 . Role of the funding sources The funding bodies had no role in study design , collection , analy - sis and interpretation of data , in writing the manuscript , and in the decision to submit this paper for publication . K . Kuwelker et al . / The Lancet Regional Health - Europe 3 ( 2021 ) 100014 3 4 . Results 4 . 1 . Participants Between 28th February and 4th April 2020 , 228 out of 3319 RT - PCR tested individuals were identi ﬁ ed as SARS - CoV - 2 positive in Ber - gen ( Fig . 1 ) . All positive cases were contacted , of which 144 cases were enroled in the study . In households where more than one case resided , the primary case was de ﬁ ned as the index patient and 32 non - primary cases were rede ﬁ ned as household members . amongst 245 eligible household members , 179 were enroled in the study ( see supplementary methods ) . The ﬁ nal cohort for analysis consisted of 112 index patients and 179 household members ( Fig . 1 and 2B ) . Index patients were home isolated and their household members were instructed to quarantine . Overall , there was an equal distribution of males and females , but household members were younger than the index patients ( supplementary Table 1 ) . A large proportion ( 73 % , 130 / 179 ) of household members reported having COVID - 19 compati - ble symptoms . During the study period , 1 . 1 % of the population of Bergen was tested ( 3319 / 284000 ) , with positive RT - PCR results in 6 . 9 % ( 228 / 3319 ) of those tested ( Fig . 2 ) . This corresponds to a minimal daily incidence of 2 . 2 RT - PCR - con ﬁ rmed cases per 100000 population , but the minimal daily incidence of probable cases is 3 . 9 per 100000 con - sidering the lower sensitivity of RT - PCR . We expect low prevalence amongst non - tested population , since there was high general aware - ness in the population and since the strict lockdown ef ﬁ ciently curbed the epidemic within a few weeks . We found there was little clustering of cases in speci ﬁ c districts of the city , with a variation in detected cases between 15 / 100 000 and 36 / 100 000 inhabitants . 5 . Household attack rate We measured SARS - CoV - 2 - spike - speci ﬁ c IgG in household mem - bers to calculate the household attack rate . The overall attack rate in households was 45 % ( 95 % CI 38 (cid:1) 53 ) , with no signi ﬁ cant gender dif - ference ( table 1 ) . Attack rates varied between 26 % and 73 % amongst the 10 - year age cohorts . Interestingly , the attack rate in children aged 0 (cid:1) 10 years ( 48 % ) was similar to that of adults ( aOR 1 . 51 [ 95 % CI 0 . 42 (cid:1) 5 . 41 ] ; p = 0 . 529 ) . Titres of spike - speci ﬁ c IgG amongst seroposi - tive children (cid:3) 10 years old were signi ﬁ cantly higher ( p = 0 . 03 ) than in adults ( 21 (cid:1) 31 years old ) ( Fig . 3A ) . As expected , symptoms were related to COVID - 19 infection , and seroconversion occurred in 56 % ( 95 % CI 48 (cid:1) 64 ) of symptomatic and 16 % ( 95 % CI 9 (cid:1) 29 ) of asymptom - atic household members ( table 1 ) . Household size was not convinc - ingly associated with household transmission . Attack rates were higher in two - person households ( 57 % [ 95 % CI 42 (cid:1) 70 ] ) ( table 1 ) , but household size varied between age groups , with the majority of the oldest household members living in two - person households . There was no signi ﬁ cant correlation of attack rate between families with children and only spouses , ( data not shown ) . When potential co - pri - mary cases were removed in a sensitivity analysis , the household attack rate remains largely unchanged ( supplementary Table 2 ) . 6 . Comparison of RT - PCR and seroconversion The seroconversion and RT - PCR positivity rates were further com - pared in the 70 household members who were RT - PCR tested during acute illness . We found that spike IgG detected a higher number of infected household members ( 44 / 70 vs . 32 / 70 ) , with a lower varia - tion amongst different age cohorts ( ranging from 27 to 73 % vs 14 to 86 % ) than RT - PCR , and thus are more sensitive and robust in detect - ing infected individuals ( table 2 and supplementary ﬁ gure 3 ) . Of the 32 household members who tested positive by RT - PCR during acute illness , twenty - eight ( 88 % ) did seroconvert ( table 2 ) , in contrast , 111 / 112 ( 99 % ) index patients seroconverted ( supplementary Table 1 ) . If infection is de ﬁ ned by either seroconversion or RT - PCR positivity , the overall attack rate was 47 % amongst household members . As only symptomatic people were tested , RT - PCR positivity amongst asymptomatic household members was not assessed . Inter - estingly , of the 38 household members who were RT - PCR tested neg - ative , sixteen ( 42 % , [ 95 % CI 28 (cid:1) 58 ] ) seroconverted ( table 2 ) . Amongst the 38 household members who were RT - PCR negative , 16 were seropositive , and 15 / 16 ( 94 % ) reported COVID - 19 related symptoms . Median time between date of symptom onset and date of RT - PCR test was ﬁ ve days for seropositive , RT - PCR negative household members . We found no signi ﬁ cant difference in the antibody titres in sero - converters who tested RT - PCR positive or negative ( Fig . 3G ) . Intrigu - ingly , asymptomatic but seroconverted household members had similar spike speci ﬁ c antibody titre with symptomatic and serocon - verted ones ( Fig . 3D ) . Interestingly , amongst children ( 0 (cid:1) 10 years ) with symptoms compatible with COVID - 19 , only 14 % ( 1 / 7 ) of those tested with RT - PCR were positive , while 48 % ( 11 / 23 ) seroconverted ( table 2 ) . In con - trast , amongst symptomatic persons aged > 60 years , 86 % ( 6 / 7 ) of those tested were RT - PCR positive , while 73 % ( 11 / 15 ) seroconverted . 6 . 1 . Neutralising antibody responses We further analysed the neutralising antibody response by using the sensitive microneutralisation assay and the virus neutralisation assay which measures sterilising immunity . Signi ﬁ cantly higher neu - tralisation titres were found in adults > 60 years old than in younger adults ( Fig . 3B - C ) . Although children had higher spike - speci ﬁ c IgG Fig . 1 . Recruitment procedure of study participants . Between 28 . 02 . 2020 and 04 . 04 . 2020 , 223 SARS - CoV - 2 cases were identi ﬁ ed amongst 3319 SARS - CoV - 2 suspected cases that were RT - PCR - tested ( 1 . 1 % of popula - tion tested ) , out of which 194 were included in the study . There were 245 eligible household members , out of which 148 were included . In households with more than one case , 31 non - primary cases were rede ﬁ ned as household members , giving a total of 179 household members . Possible household clusters of six or nine co - primary cases had symptom onset within 24 or 48 h , respectively , after symptom onset in the index patient . Forty household members did not consent , 3 of whom were RT - PCR positive , 18 were children under 10 years old and 12 were under 20 years old . In total , we included 291 people comprising 112 index patients living with others and their 179 household members . Fifty - one cases were not included in the analyses as they lived alone or were de ﬁ ned as single - person households because they did not have house - hold members who wished to participate in the study . 4 K . Kuwelker et al . / The Lancet Regional Health - Europe 3 ( 2021 ) 100014 than adults ( 21 (cid:1) 30 years ) , they had similar titres of neutralising anti - bodies . Furthermore , household members who seroconverted devel - oped comparable levels of neutralising antibodies regardless of RT - PCR result ( Fig . 3HI ) . There was a trend of higher neutralising anti - bodies amongst symptomatic seroconverted household members , although not statistically signi ﬁ cant ( Fig . 3EF ) . 6 . 2 . Risk factors for transmission The risk factors for household transmission are presented in table 1 and supplementary Table 3 . Whereas attack rates did not increase when the index patient had a cough ( aOR 1 . 05 [ 95 % CI 0 . 51 (cid:1) 2 . 16 ] ; p = 0 . 09 ) , transmission was more likely when the index patients had fever ( aOR 3 . 31 [ 95 % CI 1 . 52 (cid:1) 7 . 24 ] ; p = 0 . 003 ) or dyspnoea ( aOR 2 . 25 [ 95 % CI 1 . 80 (cid:1) 4 . 62 ] ; p = 0 . 027 ) ( table 1 ) . Neutralising antibodies were also signi ﬁ cantly associated with fever and dyspnoea ( supplementary Table 3 ) . 7 . Discussion Studies on household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 provide crucial knowledge about the transmission dynamics of the virus in immuno - logically naïve individuals in a home environment characterized by limited personal protection . Norway contained community transmis - sion at an early phase of the pandemic ’ s ﬁ rst wave by prompt lock - down of the society . This ensured that our study was conducted with low levels of community transmission and negligible baseline immu - nity amongst the participants , which can otherwise confound house - hold transmission studies . To investigate household transmission , we recruited the initial 112 households of RT - PCR con ﬁ rmed SARS - CoV - 2 index patients during the ﬁ rst 35 days of the outbreak in Bergen , in a case - ascertained study . Our study was explicitly designed to measure household attack rates based on the serological evaluation of SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c antibodies . We found higher rates of trans - mission within households than previously reported [ 11 - 21 ] , particu - larly in young children . The overall household attack rate as measured by seroconversion amongst household members of RT - PCR con ﬁ rmed , home - isolated patients was 45 % . Currently , there are only two other studies that have estimated household attack rates based on seropositivity , 37 % in Spain [ 7 ] and 35 % in Brazil [ 23 ] . Although both studies had large sample sizes in the early phase of the pandemic , they are population - based serosurveillance surveys with high levels of community trans - mission and they cannot con ﬁ rm that subjects were infected by a household member . Our study was speci ﬁ cally designed to assess household attack rates as measured by seropositivity in household members 6 (cid:1) 8 weeks after nasopharyngeal sampling in index patients , at a time of low prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 virus in the com - munity . Thus , our data provide a more accurate estimate of attack rates . We calculated attack rates based on SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c antibod - ies in household members , whereas most previous studies have ascertained transmission based on RT - PCR , with estimates of 6 % to 38 % [ 11 - 20 ] . RT - PCR can only detect SARS - CoV - 2 during the acute phase and has been reported to have an unsatisfactory positivity rate ( [ 24 , 25 ] ) . Thus , the household attack rates are likely underestimated in RT - PCR - based studies . This is supported by our ﬁ nding that the seropositivity rate amongst RT - PCR negative household members ( 42 % ) was as high as the overall seropositivity rate amongst all house - hold members ( 45 % ) , despite testing at a median of 5 days after symptom onset , an optimal time for RT - PCR positivity . Although we have a relatively small subgroup of RT - PCR negative household members during the inclusion period , our ﬁ ndings have two major implications . Firstly , using RT - PCR amongst household members Fig . 2 . The course of the ﬁ rst wave of the pandemic in Bergen and period of recruitment of index patients and household members .

Kuwelker et al . / The Lancet Regional Health - Europe 3 ( 2021 ) 100014 7 of con ﬁ rmed cases has a low predictive value , and solely relying on RT - PCR could consequently cause further transmission from false - negative cases to new individuals in both the household and the community . Secondly , our ﬁ ndings highlight that serological test - ing is equally or more effective than RT - PCR in con ﬁ rming a ﬁ nal diagnosis of COVID - 19 , especially amongst household members . This is supported by several studies demonstrating the importance of serological testing to con ﬁ rm cases ( [ 26 , 27 ] ) . However , amongst the household members in our study who had a positive RT - PCR test at the time of symptoms , 13 % did not seroconvert , whereas 99 % of index patients seroconverted . If we extrapolate an 87 % sensitivity of our assay to our whole cohort , the total attack rate would be 51 % . Thus , the true attack rate in our study is likely higher than estimated solely by seroconversion . According to a recent meta - analysis [ 5 ] , an average of 15 % of RT - PCR con ﬁ rmed cases are asymptomatic , and importantly asymptom - atic children have lower viral loads [ 28 ] . We found that 16 % of asymptomatic household members seroconverted , and in addition , 42 % of RT - PCR negative household members seroconverted . Thus , our ﬁ ndings show that close contacts of con ﬁ rmed cases are poten - tially contagious , irrespective of being asymptomatic or having a neg - ative RT - PCR result . Children have been reported to be less affected by COVID - 19 [ 29 ] and previous studies have reported a secondary attack rate of 4 % to 23 % amongst children ( [ 13 , 17 , 19 , 21 ] ) . We found that a large pro - portion of children aged 0 (cid:1) 10 years were infected ( 48 % ) in a house - hold setting . The lower attack rates in previous studies may be due to the use of RT - PCR as a diagnostic method , consequently underesti - mating the number of secondary cases amongst children . Indeed , our data show a lower positivity rate on RT - PCR amongst symptomatic children compared to serological testing , which contrasts with older age cohorts . Due to the low number of RT - PCR tested children , the robustness of our observation needs to be con ﬁ rmed in larger studies but suggests careful consideration of negative RT - PCR results in chil - dren . Estimates of transmission to children are also likely to be lower since children often present with milder symptoms , possibly result - ing in lower testing rates . We conducted serological testing of all chil - dren in the household , regardless of symptoms . With an attack rate of almost 50 % as measured by seroconversion , our results show that children may have higher infection rates than has been previously reported ( [ 7 , 13 , 17 , 21 ] ) . In our study , household members > 60 years old had a high attack rate ( 73 % , table 1 ) , con ﬁ rming ﬁ ndings from other studies on house - hold transmission amongst older age groups ( [ 12 , 14 ] ) . Moreover , we found sterilising neutralising antibodies in all but one of the seroposi - tive participants aged > 60 years ( Fig . 3 ) . The ﬁ nding that index patients with fever and dyspnoea were more likely to transmit infection to others , is not surprising as patients with more severe symptoms may require closer follow - up and care , incurring increased risk of transmission . It may appear counter - intuitive that cough in the index patient was not a signi ﬁ cant risk factor for transmission . A likely explanation for this would be that , due to widespread awareness of this transmission route , cough would trigger household members to use precautions such as dis - tancing and masque use , while a person with other symptoms such as fever and dyspnoea may not be perceived as equally infectious . Whilst self - isolation of cases and good hygiene may prevent infec - tion within a household , pre - existing immunity may also be impor - tant . Recently , pre - existing cross - reactive T - cell immunity derived from infection with human coronaviruses has been speculated to protect from infection [ 30 ] . Although , the immune response to the SARS - CoV - 2 virus is multifaceted and the correlates of protection from COVID - 19 disease have yet to be de ﬁ ned . The presence of spike - speci ﬁ c antibodies does not directly correlate with protective immu - nity and therefore we used stringent serological assays measuring both microneutralising antibodies , which may prevent re - infection , and virus neutralising antibodies which provide sterilizing immunity . No neutralising antibodies were found in the household members who did not seroconvert ( supplementary ﬁ gure 4 ) . When comparing the different assays , we found the highest attack rates measured by spike - speci ﬁ c antibodies , and lower numbers of household members developed neutralising antibodies . The strengths of our study are the centralized testing facility which allowed for the identi ﬁ cation of all RT - PCR test positive cases in Bergen , the low levels of community spread and the stringent use of serological assays to de ﬁ ne infected people , ﬁ rstly by screening all subjects for RBD - speci ﬁ c antibodies , then con ﬁ rming infection by SARS - CoV - 2 spike ELISA and by two neutralisations assays . Further strengths are the inclusion of families with children , as well as a sub - group of subjects who were both tested by RT - PCR and serology , detailed interviews to de ﬁ ne the true index case and risk factors for infection . The study was speci ﬁ cally designed to identify household attack rate , and inclusion started with the ﬁ rst RT - PCR positive case in the city , followed by detailed interviews to differentiate between index patients and household members . The interpretation of our ﬁ ndings has some limitations , which may in ﬂ uence our estimation of attack rates . Despite high participa - tion rates , there may have been a bias in who consented to partici - pate , limiting and in ﬂ uencing our interpretation of results . During our study inclusion period , all individuals were RT - PCR tested at a single time during acute illness and more accurate diagnosis may have been provided by repeated RT - PCR testing . There was also a risk that the index patient was not correctly identi ﬁ ed , although to mini - mize this , extensive telephone interviews were conducted once a positive case was identi ﬁ ed . Likewise , we cannot exclude the possi - bility that some cases and household members had a common source of exposure outside the household , although a sensitivity analysis excluding possible co - primary results did not change results . In conclusion , we found a higher household attack rate of SARS - CoV - 2 than previous studies , and show that serological testing is more sensitive and robust than RT - PCR - testing in assessing attack rates . Children are far more susceptible to household transmission than previously reported , and relying on RT - PCR for diagnosis may miss the majority of infected children . This highlights the importance of including children when considering measures to reduce spread of SARS - CoV - 2 virus . The risk of transmission was highest from index patients with dyspnoea and fever , both potential surrogate markers for severity of disease .
