O . Box 90046 - 17 Jon - Ho , Taipei County , Taiwan , ROC Abstract Both as power and a resource , knowledge is a signiﬁcant asset both for individuals and organizations . Thus , knowledge management has become one of the important issues for enterprises . However , when facing problems , people generally resort to their prior knowledge and experience for solutions . Such routine problem - solving strategy is termed ‘‘knowledge inertia’’ . This study aims to establish the constructs of knowledge inertia and examine the relationships between knowledge inertia , organizational learning and organizational innovation . Structural equation modeling is employed to discuss the degree of inﬂuence each construct has on each other and whether their relationships vary in different organization types . A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from government organizations as well as state - run and private enterprises . A total of 485 valid responses were collected . Our results reveal that knowledge inertia comprises both learning inertia and experience inertia . The relationships between the three variables are as follows . First , knowledge inertia exerts a mediating effect on organizational innovation through organizational learning . Second , when a ﬁrm’s members have either less learning inertia or more experience inertia , the performance of the organizational learning will be better . r 2007 Elsevier Ltd .

Introduction Both as power and a resource , knowledge is strategically important for individuals and enterprises . The third industrial revolution is based on knowledge which changes the way an individual , an enterprise or even a nation can create wealth and prosperity . Thus , successful knowledge management can be the chief determinant for the survival of an enterprise in a knowledge - based economy . Since the 1990s , there has been much interest in the exploration of knowledge management and the develop - ment of knowledge management theories . Nonaka ( 1994 ) proposed a theory of organizational knowledge creation where enterprises are encouraged to adopt novel ideas while reforming old operational procedures and creating new ones . Innovations are the prerequisite of knowledge creation and the essence of knowledge management . Faced with an ever - changing environment , innovations provide an enterprise with ﬂexibility for changes , which is the key to its survival and success . Drucker ( 1985 ) considers knowledge the only source of an enterprise’s competitive advantage . Hence , to meet current challenges , enterprises should seek ways to strengthen the research and develop - ment of knowledge , to manage it efﬁciently and to utilize it effectively . Nevertheless , hurdles to efﬁcient and effective knowledge management are many . Using the principles of inertia in physics to knowledge management , Liao ( 2002 ) states that knowledge inertia may inhibit an organization’s capability to learn and solve problems . Often routine problem - solving procedures are adopted to save time and effort as well as to avoid risks . Stagnant knowledge sources and obsolete prior experience result in the same solutions and approaches being employed to deal with problems . Such predictability in management behavior may make an enterprise more risk in a highly vulnerable competitive environment . Inertia not only has negative impact on knowledge utilization , but may also disclose an enterprise’s commercial secrets and strategies . In other words , organizations showing inertia in ARTICLE IN PRESS www . elsevier . com / locate / technovation 0166 - 4972 / $ - see front matter r 2007 Elsevier Ltd .

Liao ) . thinking and policy - making may suffer loss and failure . This further highlights the importance of innovations in knowledge management and that enterprises should devote efforts to avoid inertia . The theory of knowledge inertia proposed by Liao ( 2002 ) has not been tested empirically . Therefore , this research attempts to establish the constructs of knowledge inertia using principal analysis and examines the relation - ships between knowledge inertia , organizational learning and organizational innovation with structural equation modeling approach . The sample of organizations studied includes government organizations ( ofﬁcials on central and regional government ) as well as state - run and private enterprises ( manufacturing and services industry ) . 2 . Theoretical framework 2 . 1 . Knowledge inertia In physics , the principle of inertia states that objects continue in a state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by forces . Unless interrupted , an object’s motion is subject to physical constraints and objects will move in the predicted trajectory . That human ( s ) can track and reach moving objects by predicting where the objects are going . This phenomenon suggests that human cognition also has inertia ( Hofsten et al . , 1998 ; Kavcic et al . , 1999 ) . The overall procedure explains several things . Firstly , predic - tion is based on the understanding that there is a trajectory if objects move then we can track and reach them according to their inertia . Secondly , changes in moving trajectory only happen if objects are interrupted by outside forces . This means that any change of inertia is caused by outside forces . Thirdly , change does not spontaneously , but must be implemented . In human cognition , there is an explanatory process , which derives understanding from a view that other things have already been done ( Schank , 1986 ) . For example , as we read a text or listen to a discussion , we use our knowledge about what has already been written or spoken to help us tie together the pieces of what we hear . Our past knowledge helps us predict what we will hear next , disambiguate words , resolve pronouns , and make connections between the various things being discussed . This implies that our past knowledge of what has happened in some situations allow us to infer similar things and to explain it ( Kolonder , 1994 ) . In system logic programs , there is a commonsense law of inertia , which states that things do not change unless they are made to change . The fact that revision program - ming is easily captured in logic programs using such inertia rules can help to clarify the nature of the revisions captured by programming . It also provides a crucial element of proposals for representing knowledge about actions in default logic and logic programming ( Przymusinski and Turner , 1997 ) . On the other hand , people are usually either right - handed or left - handed from infancy , which is a physical inertia that is used throughout life and is very difﬁcult to change . We can also consider if there is evidence to show that a phenomenon similar to inertia , exists in knowledge use . In both individuals and organizations , a high degree of the solution of a problem is generated by the knowledge acquired from past experience and its extension to ﬁt new situations ( Sternberg , 1985 ) . People use a memory of past experiences and knowledge as a guide to generate planning for new problems . Re - using past knowl - edge to solve a new problem becomes a law or principle that similar things will remain static or uniform until the situation is no longer feasible and then is changed by outside forces . Applying the concept of inertia to human behavior shows that individuals often resort to constant methods for dealing with problems . Routine problem - solving ap - proaches and similar reasoning will be adopted to save time and effort and also avoid risks . In the context of strategic change , Huff et al . ( 1992 ) describe inertia as an ‘‘overarching concept that encompasses personal commit - ments , ﬁnancial investment sand institutional mechanisms supporting the current ways of doing things y inertia describes the tendency to remain with the status quo and the resistance to strategic renewal outside the frame of current strategy’’ ( p . 55 ) . This deﬁnition leads us to the concept of mental inertia , which originates in cognitive and learning approaches , thus linking the ﬁrm’s difﬁculties to change to cognitive structures , perception and interpreta - tion . On the other hand , everything stemming from past experience and knowledge without revision and updating would imply predictable management behavior and pro - blem - solving strategy of an enterprise ( Liao , 2002 ) . That is to say , inertia would result in lack of innovation and expected behavior , which may jeopardize the survival or undermine the advantage of an enterprise in a highly competitive environment . Hence , it is important for an organization or enterprise to avoid the negative impact of inertia on its capability to learn and it should utilize knowledge efﬁciently and effectively . 2 . 2 . Organizational learning All humans are born with the ability to learn and it is through learning that they adapt to the changing and evolving environment . Learning leads to new insights and concepts . It often occurs when we take effective actions and when we detect and correct our own mistakes ( Argyris and Schon , 1978 ) . As to the learning of an organization , Morgan and Ramirez ( 1983 ) suggest that organizational learning occurs when members use learning to solve a common problem they are facing . Every organization will develop the most suitable learning method taking into consideration the needs and characteristics of the organiza - tion itself ( Helleloid and Simonin , 1994 ) . There are two types of organizational learning com - monly discussed in the literature . Firstly , exploitative learning ( March , 1991 ) is the acquisition of new behavioral capacities framed within existing insights . Exploitative ARTICLE IN PRESS S . - h . Liao et al . / Technovation 28 ( 2008 ) 183 – 195 184 learning is described in the literature as ‘‘single - loop’’ ( Argyris and Schon , 1978 , 1996 ) , ‘‘operational’’ ( Coopey , 1996 ) , ‘‘ﬁrst - order’’ ( Fox - Wolfgramm et al . , 1998 ) , ‘‘evolu - tional’’ , ‘‘frame - taking’’ , ‘‘reactive’’ ( Weick and Westley , 1996 ) and ‘‘incremental’’ ( Miner and Mezias , 1996 ) . Secondly , explorative learning ( March , 1991 ) occurs when organizations acquire behavioral capacities that differ fundamentally from existing insights . Exploration is about discovery , variation , effectiveness , ﬂexibility and innova - tion ( March , 1991 ; Weick and Westley , 1996 ) . This type of organizational learning is referred to as ‘‘double - loop’’ ( Argyris and Schon , 1978 , 1996 ) , ‘‘strategic’’ ( Coopey , 1996 ) , ‘‘second - order’’ ( Fox - Wolfgramm et al . , 1998 ) , ‘‘revolutionary’’ , ‘‘frame - breaking’’ , ‘‘proactive’’ ( Weick and Westley , 1996 ) and ‘‘radical’ ( Miner and Mezias , 1996 ) . Different organizational structures are conducive to different types of learning . Mechanistic structures with tightly coupled relationships between actors foster exploi - tative learning in stable contexts , while organic structures with loosely coupled relationships are favorable to the occurrence of explorative learning in changing contexts ( Burns and Stalker , 1961 ; Weick and Westley , 1996 ; Rowley et al . , 2000 ; Hansen et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , Clegg et al . ( 2005 ) propose a perspective that sees learning not as something that is done to organizations , or as something that an organization does ; rather , learning and organizing are seen as mutually constitutive and unstable , yet pragmatic , constructs that might enable a dynamic appreciation of organizational life . Therefore , in a long - term development , organizational learning may contain both natures of exploitative and exploration learning on different organization types and development stages in order to keep organization constantly growth . On the other hand , Kim ( 1993 ) and Morgan ( 1997 ) describe the learning process as the acquisition , interpreta - tion and implementation of new knowledge ; and similarly Huber ( 1991 ) identiﬁes it as the acquisition , dissemination , interpretation and storage of new knowledge . Argote ( 1999 ) view that organizational learning involves three stages : acquisition , sharing and storage . Interpretation is not seen as a discrete stage but more as an activity arising throughout the learning process . Furthermore , implemen - tation is not a necessary element of the process since as learning refers to the evolution of cognitive capacities , which may or may not lead to action . Therefore , a learning organization has the ability to continuously adjust to new situations and to renew itself according to the demands of the environment ( Jaw and Liu , 2003 ) . To enhance its capability to learn , an organization should establish a system where individual learning can be shared among members ( Tsang , 1997 ) . Learning by an individual forms the basis of organizational learning ; it is through individual learning that an organization will also learn as a whole ( Grant , 1996 ) . However , Adams et al . ( 1998 ) identify inertia as a barrier that hinders an organization’s capabilities for learning about markets for new product development . In addition , knowledge inertia may inhibit the learning ability of an individual ( Liao , 2002 ) . This may in turn affect organiza - tional learning . Thus , our ﬁrst hypothesis is stated as follows . H1 . Knowledge inertia is negatively related to organiza - tional learning . 2 . 3 . Organizational innovation Most of the literature on innovation has focused on technological innovation ( Abernathy and Clark , 1985 ; Freeman and Soete , 2000 ) , and the restricted view resulting from that bias has been criticized in studies of organiza - tional innovation ( Easingwood , 1986 ; Barras , 1990 ; Gal - louj and Weinstein , 1997 ; Avlonitis et al . , 2001 ) . However , the concepts ‘innovation’ and ‘organization’ are central to organizational theory . The most common distinction with respect to types of innovation is between product and process innovation . Organizational innovation is often added to these two basic types . Business organizations attempt to create value and thereby achieve competitive success . Ever since Schumpeter ( 1934 ) pointed out that innovation plays an important in economic development , it has received much attention and has been widely studied for its organizational innovation issues ( Daft and Becker , 1978 ; Hage and Aiken , 1970 ; Damanpour , 1991 ; Tang , 1998 ; Stjernberg and Philips , 1993 ; Kickul and Gundry , 2001 ; Wijnberg , 2004 ) . For an organization , innovation would denote the generation or adoption of novel ideas or behavior . Hence , to an enterprise , an innovation can be a new product or service , a new production technology , a new operation procedure or a new management strategy . Most successful innovations are the result of gradual changes in concepts and methodology implemented continually over time ( Tushman and Nadler , 1986 ) . Accumulation of organiza - tional resources relies on the creation , search , acquisition and sharing of knowledge ; and effective organizational innovation is the key to maintain competitive advantage in a constantly changing environment ( Lemon and Sahota , 2004 ) . In the literature on organizational innovation , there are many models . In view of the varied nature of organizational innovation , this study adopts the dual - core model ( Damanpour , 1991 ) , which is based on the distinc - tion between administrative and technical innovations . While it is recognized that organizational innovation is the key determinant of an enterprise’s success or failure , the question of whether knowledge inertia would affect the implementation of organizational innovation remains to be explored . In addition , Liao et al . ( 2007 ) investigate the relationships between knowledge sharing , absorptive capacity , and innovation capability in Taiwan’s knowledge - intensive industries . They ﬁnd that absorptive capacity is the intervening factor between knowledge sharing and innova - tion capability . Research ﬁndings also show that knowledge ARTICLE IN PRESS S . - h . Liao et al . / Technovation 28 ( 2008 ) 183 – 195 185 sharing has a positive effect on absorptive capacity , and that a completely mediating model exhibits both model general - ization and extension characteristics through multiple model comparison in different industry population samples . Hence , our second hypothesis is as follows . H2 . Knowledge inertia is negatively related to organiza - tional innovation . 2 . 4 . Relationship between organizational learning and organizational innovation Argyris and Schon ( 1978 ) suggest that organizational learning would enhance the innovative capacity of an organization . Stata ( 1989 ) regards innovation as a result of individual and organizational learning and as the only source of lasting competitive advantage in a knowledge - intensive industry . Foster ( 1986 ) proposes the S - shaped learning curve for innovative products . According to this curve , under a constant technology , increased production will only bring diminishing returns . Only continual innovations can prevent this decrease and ensure increasing proﬁts . Moreover , different organizational learning styles will result in different innovation activities ( McKee , 1992 ) . Single - loop learning will lead only to a quantitative increase in innovations , and a qualitative increase in innovations can be achieved only by double - loop learning . Meta - learning , which comprises both single - and double - loop learning , contributes to innovations , thus enhancing learning of the whole organization . Gerybadze and Reger ( 1999 ) ﬁnd that organizational learning has a positive relationship with organization innovation on globalization of R & D . In addition , Greve ( 2005 ) describes how organizations can learn from the innovations made or adopted by other organizations . In doing so , he presents a framework for inter - organizational learning that allows study of how learning is affected by the characteristics of the origin and destination organizations , as well as their relationships . The ﬁndings of these studies reveal that organizational learning and organizational innovation are related . Hence , our third hypothesis is as follows . In addition , examines the effects of organizational learning and teamwork cohesion on organizations’ capacity to use innovation ( technical and administrative ) to meet the changing needs of their environment . This paper veriﬁes how certain characteristics of the ﬁrm ( support leadership and teamwork cohesion ) signiﬁcantly affect both learning and innovation , as well as showing the implications of these in organizational performance . On the other hand , Jay et al . ( 2006 ) present a study of SME’s and suggest that market focused learning , relative to other learning cap - abilities plays a key role in the relationships between industry structure , innovation and brand performance . The ﬁndings also show that market focused learning and internally focused learning inﬂuence innovation and that innovation inﬂuences a brand’s performance . In addition , Alberto et al . ( 2007 ) propose a research ﬁnding that leadership style , an individual feature , and organizational learning , a collective process , simultaneously and positively affect ﬁrm innovation . A structural equation model and data from 408 large ﬁrms in four sectors supported their hypotheses . Organizational learning had a stronger direct inﬂuence on innovation than CEO transformational leadership ; however , leadership had a strong , signiﬁ - cant inﬂuence on organizational learning , indirectly affect - ing ﬁrm innovation . Thus , our third hypothesis is as follows . H3 . Organization learning is positively related to organiza - tional innovation . 2 . 5 . Moderating effect of organization type Different types of organizations have different organiza - tion cultures , which in turn inﬂuence organizational learning ( Chou , 2003 ) . Hult et al . ( 2003 ) examine four organization types with different combinations of scale and history , and ﬁnd that a larger organization with a longer history has better performance in organizational learning . Above literature reviews have shown that different organization types have different cultures , which may in turn inﬂuence organizational learning . Hence , our fourth hypothesis probes the inﬂuence of organization type on organizational learning and organizational innovation . H4 . Organization type has a moderating effect on the impact of knowledge inertia on organizational learning and innovation . Fig . 1 displays the theoretical framework of this research which summarizes our four hypotheses . 3 . Research methodology 3 . 1 . Sample After pre - test and modiﬁcations , questionnaires were sent out to selected respondents . According to the maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) , in order for the sample to be effective , the number of respondents should be between 100 and 150 ( Ding et al . , 1995 ) . The sample comprises three organization types , namely government organizations , state - run and private enterprises .

Liao et al . / Technovation 28 ( 2008 ) 183 – 195 186 1200 questionnaires were sent out , 400 to each organization type . To ensure that the sample is representative , equal numbers of government organizations at both central and regional levels were included . State - run and private enterprises were randomly chosen from 1000 and 500 of these enterprises , respectively , listed under the manufactur - ing and servicing sectors of Taiwan ( Li and Chen , 2003 ) . A total of 1200 questionnaires were sent out , there were a total of 485 valid responses , for an effective response rate of 40 . 42 % ( Table 1 ) . 3 . 2 . Establishing the constructs of knowledge inertia According to Liao ( 2002 ) , knowledge inertia occurs when people use routine problem - solving procedures , resort to stagnant sources for new knowledge , and continue to follow past knowledge or experience . In the light of Liao’s deﬁnition , this study proposes constructs for measuring knowledge inertia using the Likert ﬁve - point scale . Table 2 displays the questions used to investigate the three deﬁnitions of knowledge inertia . After establishing the measuring constructs according to the original deﬁnition of knowledge inertia , exploratory factor analysis—principal analysis , is conducted to ﬁnd if there are other hidden factors . Table 3 displays the loading of the two factors obtained by exploratory factor analysis . As can be seen in Table 2 , there are only two factors with eigenvalue l greater than 1 . In view of the discrepancy between the distribution of questions and the three original deﬁnitions of knowledge inertia , Question 3 – 1 of Factor I was deleted . The questions for measuring knowledge inertia were then reclassiﬁed under two constructs : learning inertia and experience inertia as shown in Table 4 . As seen in the above reliability analysis , the Cronbach’s a of the two constructs are both above 0 . 7 , revealing that the modiﬁed questionnaire can be a valid measure for knowledge inertia . 3 . 3 .

Questionnaire development 3 . 4 . 1 . Reliability analysis Reliability of a construct refers to the consistency and stability of the questions . Table 6 lists the Cronbach’s a of the constructs . As can be seen , with the exception of the construct of experience inertia ( Cronbach’s a ¼ 0 . 602 ) , all other constructs have Cronbach’s a above 0 . 7 , which indicates high reliability ( Nunnally , 1978 ) . 3 . 4 . 2 .

As can be seen , all constructs have T - values greater than 2 , revealing good convergent validity .

Liao et al . / Technovation 28 ( 2008 ) 183 – 195 187 ( 2 ) Discriminant validity : Anderson and Gerbing ( 1988 ) suggest the following procedure to test the discriminant validity of a variable : ﬁrst , the constructs of a variable are set to be correlated and be termed the unconstrained model . Second , the unconstrained model is modiﬁed with one of correlations set to be 1 . 0 and then to be call constrained model . If the Chi - square difference between the two models is signiﬁcant , this implies that the two constructs of the variable are different signiﬁcantly and should not be merged as one construct . It can be noted that all the Chi - square differences between two constructs in Table 8 are signiﬁcant ; therefore , the discriminant validities are veriﬁed . 3 . 4 . 3 . Correlation analysis Table 9 displays the means , standard deviations of constructs and their correlations . As can be seen , the following relationships exist between the research variables . ( 1 ) Relationship between knowledge inertia and organiza - tional learning : Experience inertia is positively related to organizational learning , meaning that members with more experience inertia show higher capability in enhancing organizational learning . On the contrary , learning inertia is negatively related to organization learning , which implies that more learning inertia among members will reduce the capacity for organizational learning . ( 2 ) Relationship between knowledge inertia and organiza - tional innovation : Experience inertia is positively related to organizational innovation . In other words , there is greater efﬁciency in enhancing organizational innovation . Never - theless , learning inertia is negatively related to organiza - tional innovation . That is to say , the greater the learning inertia among members , the less efﬁcient they are in promoting organizational innovation . ( 3 ) Relationship between organizational learning and organizational innovation : Commitment to learning , shared vision and open - mindedness all show positive correla - tion with both administration and technical innovation .

Liao et al . / Technovation 28 ( 2008 ) 183 – 195 190 compared to the partially mediating model and the direct model . This result indicates that the inﬂuence of the knowledge inertia on organizational innovation occurs by way of organizational learning . The path parameters ( g and b ) of the completely mediating model are estimated by the MLE method . The MLEs of the parameters are shown in Table 11 . The T - values of these estimates are all signiﬁcant ( 4 2 ) under signiﬁcant level 0 . 05 . The model estimation results reveal the following relationships among three research variables : ( 1 ) Relationship between knowledge inertia and organiza - tional learning : As seen in Table 11 , parameter estimates of the hypothesized relationships between learning inertia and the three constructs of organizational learning are negative and signiﬁcant , indicating negative impact of learning inertia on organizational learning . That is to say , organization members with substantial learning inertia will undermine the organization’s commitment to learning , shared vision and open - mindedness . On the other hand , T - values of the hypothesized relationships between experi - ence inertia and the three constructs of organizational learning are positive and signiﬁcant , indicating positive impact of learning inertia on organizational learning . In other words , organization members with great experience inertia will enhance the performance of the organization on commitment to learning , shared vision and open - mind - edness . According to the above , learning inertia has negative effect on organizational learning while experience inertia has positive inﬂuence on organizational learning ; hence H1 is partially supported . ( 2 ) Relationship between organizational learning and organizational innovation : As seen in Table 11 , parameter estimates of the hypothesized relationships between the three constructs of organizational learning and the two constructs of organizational innovation are positive and signiﬁcant , indicating positive impact of organizational learning on organizational innovation . In other words , higher organizational learning ability will lead to better performance in administrative and technical innovation ; hence H3 is supported . 3 . 4 . 5 . Moderating effect of organization type In order to further understand whether or not the path parameters will be inﬂuenced by the group variable ( organization type ) , Jaccard and Wan’s ( 1996 ) multi - group method is adopted to test the moderating effect of organization type . The hypothesized model assumes that the path parameters of the three organizations are the same . The alternative model assumes that path parameters of the three organizations are the same with the exception of only one path parameter . If the Chi - square difference ARTICLE IN PRESS Fig . 2 .

Also , if the moderating effect does exist , there should be further discussion about the path parameters of the three types of organizations . As seen in Table 12 , organization type does not have any moderating effect on the impact of knowledge inertia on organizational learning . That is to say , regardless of the type of organization , whether government organization , state - run or private enterprises , the effect of knowledge inertia on commitment to learning , shared vision and open - mindedness remain unchanged ; hence , H4 is not supported . 4 . Implications and contributions ( 1 ) This research has established two constructs of knowl - edge inertia , namely learning and experience inertia , which can serve as the basis for future studies . Although the questionnaire was pre - tested and mod - iﬁed , showing good reliability and validity , it may not be applicable to all research domains and there is still a room for improvement . In addition , different industries or businesses could use this measurement tool in order to modify the construct . ( 2 ) Our ﬁndings reveal that knowledge inertia exerts a complete mediating effect on organizational innovation through organization learning . Hence , when assessing and formulating measures for promoting organizational innovation , organizations should consider the mediator variable of organizational learning to avoid misjudg - ment and achieve better performance . Also , these ﬁndings can provide a reference to other research investigate whether knowledge inertia could be a research variable in terms of exploring possible relation - ships on other research issues , such as organization behavior , human resource management , knowledge ARTICLE IN PRESS Table 11 MLEs of the path parameters Paths / hypotheses Parameterestimate T - value Hypothesizedrelationship Results Learning inertia - commitment to learning ( g 11 ) (cid:2) 0 . 402 * (cid:2) 9 . 421 Negative Supported Experience inertia - commitment to learning ( g 12 ) 0 . 099 * 2 . 323 Negative Not supported Learning inertia - shared vision ( g 21 ) (cid:2) 0 . 318 * (cid:2) 7 . 166 Negative Supported Experience inertia - shared vision ( g 22 ) 0 . 096 * 2 . 158 Negative Not supported Learning inertia - open - mindedness ( g 31 ) (cid:2) 0 . 316 * (cid:2) 7 . 154 Negative Supported Experience inertia - open - mindedness ( g 32 ) 0 . 128 * 2 . 894 Negative Not supported Commitment to learning - administrative innovation ( b 41 ) 0 . 158 * 3 . 653 Positive Supported Shared vision - administrative innovation ( b 42 ) 0 . 319 * 6 . 436 Positive Supported Open - mindedness - administrative innovation ( b 43 ) 0 . 409 * 8 . 221 Positive Supported Commitment to learning - technical innovation ( b 51 ) 0 . 209 * 4 . 683 Positive Supported Shared vision - technical innovation ( b 52 ) 0 . 188 * 3 . 672 Positive Supported Open - mindedness - technical innovation ( b 53 ) 0 . 474 * 9 . 225 Positive Supported Note 1 : Completely mediating model , w 2 ¼ 3 . 545 , GFI ¼ 0 . 998 , CFI ¼ 0 . 999 , NFI ¼ 1 . 000 .

Thus , this research considers that knowledge inertia is an interdisciplinary research topic . Different research theories can broaden our horizon on this research issue . ( 3 ) Our results ﬁnd evidence that learning inertia is negatively related to organizational learning , implying that knowledge inertia does affect the learning behavior both of individual members and the organization as a whole . While inertia often inhibits learning , experience inertia shows positive impact on organizational learn - ing . To promote organizational learning and organiza - tional innovations , organizations should reduce learning inertia by encouraging members to acquire new ideas and methods . In addition , organizations should help members improve working efﬁciency through experience inertia . The sharing of accumulated experience can also enhance organizational learning ability and foster better performance in organizational innovation . ( 4 ) Our research ﬁndings show that experience inertia is positively related to organizational learning , meaning that members with more experience inertia show higher capability in enhancing organizational learning . From a cognitive or mental point of view , Huff and Huff ( 2000 ) argue that resistance to change at the level of individual cognitive processes is the primary source of inertia in organizations . They continue that inertia ‘‘results not from any external force but rather from properties inherent to the use of knowledge structures . The very properties that make schema useful sense making structures ( i . e . efﬁciency , expectancy ) also stand in the way of change’’ ( p . 46 ) . As a source of development , the changes due to internal and external reasons may enable individual and organizational learning . Therefore , to continue creating , sharing , learning , and storing knowl - edge may also become the source of organization innovation . ( 5 ) Inertia exists not only in human cognition , but also in behavior . The problem is used to ﬁnd a solution , and then the pattern of problem solving is used to ﬁx the problem . This research considers that knowledge inertia could either enable or inhibit a knowledge manipulation activity on a speciﬁc problem solving or decision - making situation due to requirements relating to the problem domain . For example , knowledge inertia is suitable to some routine works under standard operational procedures and it could be an enabling factor for knowledge management . On the other hand , knowledge inertia is a negative factor to individual’s and organizational learning and innovation . Thus , this research considers that knowledge inertia could imple - ment more research on different problem domains in order to better understand its beneﬁts and avoid its possible drawbacks . ( 6 ) A literature review has shown that there have been few studies on the role of organization type as a moderator . Different organization types have different cultures , which may in turn inﬂuence organizational learning . Our study ﬁnds no evidence of organization type exerting moderating effect on the impact of knowledge inertia on organizational learning . In other words , organization type will not change the relationship between knowledge inertia and organizational learning . Although the hypothesis is not supported by this study , the relationship between organization type and orga - nizational learning merits further exploration . ( 7 ) On the other hand , cultural context is a critical factor not only on knowledge inertia , but also organizational learning , and organization innovation for investigating their relationships . However , the ‘contextual’ inﬂuence of a speciﬁc culture is not considered in the paper . Thus , authors might incorporate cultural context factor into the future study . ( 8 ) In summary , when promoting organizational learning , care must be taken to avoid learning inertia , and efforts should be made to encourage acquisition of new knowledge and exploring new ideas and approaches . Sharing of experience and responsibility among mem - bers of the organization should be fostered to promote experience inertia in order to create a win - win situation for both the members and the organization . 5 . Conclusion This research examines the relationships between knowl - edge inertia , organizational learning and organizational innovation and the impact of knowledge inertia on organizational learning and organizational behavior . Our ﬁndings reveal that knowledge inertia exerts a complete mediating effect on organizational innovation through organization learning . In addition , this study shows that organization members with substantial learning inertia will undermine the organization’s commitment to learning , shared vision and open - mindedness . On the other hand , organization members with great experience inertia will enhance the performance of the organization on commit - ment to learning , shared vision and open - mindedness . According to the above , learning inertia has negative effect on organizational learning while experience inertia has positive inﬂuence on organizational learning . Thus , this paper suggest that when assessing and formulating measures for promoting organizational innovation , orga - nizations should consider the mediator variable of organi - zational learning to avoid misjudgment and achieve better performance .
