Cell Biol . 2018 Vol . 217 No . 12 4092 – 4105 Rockefeller University Press Caveolae are small invaginated pits that function as dynamic mechanosensors to buffer tension variations at the plasma membrane . Here we show that under mechanical stress , the EHD2 ATPase is rapidly released from caveolae , SUMOylated , and translocated to the nucleus , where it regulates the transcription of several genes including those coding for caveolae constituents . We also found that EHD2 is required to maintain the caveolae reservoir at the plasma membrane during the variations of membrane tension induced by mechanical stress . Metal - replica electron microscopy of breast cancer cells lacking EHD2 revealed a complete absence of caveolae and a lack of gene regulation under mechanical stress . Expressing EHD2 was sufficient to restore both functions in these cells . Our findings therefore define EHD2 as a central player in mechanotransduction connecting the disassembly of the caveolae reservoir with the regulation of gene transcription under mechanical stress . EHD2 is a mechanotransducer connecting caveolae dynamics with gene transcription Stéphanie Torrino 1 , 2 , 3 * , Wei‑Wei Shen 1 , 2 , 3 * , Cédric M .

Mechano - transduction controls multiple cellular aspects including , but not limited to , cell growth , shape , or differentiation ( Iskratsch et al . , 2014 ) . Abnormal cell responses to external and internal mechani - cal constraints are often associated with human pathologies such as heart diseases , myopathies , and cancer ( DuFort et al . , 2011 ) . The underlying mechanisms integrating mechanosensing with mechanotransduction remain poorly understood . Caveolae are 60 – 80 - nm bulb - like plasma membrane invagina - tions discovered more than 60 years ago ( Palade , 1953 ; Yamada , 1955 ) . Caveolae are generated through tight association of cave - olin 1 ( Cav1 ) oligomers , its main structural component , and are stabilized by the assembly of cytoplasmic cavins into a coat - like structure around the caveolae bulb ( Gambin et al . , 2013 ; Ludwig et al . , 2013 ; Stoeber et al . , 2016 ) . We established a new function of ca - veolae in mechanosensing and mechanoprotection in endothelial and muscle cells : under increase of membrane tension generated by cell swelling or stretching , caveolae flatten out immediately to provide additional surface area and prevent the rupture of the plasma membrane ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) . The central role of caveolae in cell mechanics has been confirmed in vivo ( Cheng et al . , 2015 ; Garcia et al . , 2017 ; Lim et al . , 2017 ) and has been extended to the muscle - specific isoform Cav3 ( Cheng et al . , 2015 ; Lo et al . , 2015 ) and other cell types ( Gervásio et al . , 2011 ; Ariotti et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we reveal that the Eps15 homology domain - containing 2 ( EHD2 ) ATPase is released from mechanically disassembled cav - eolae and is subsequently translocated to the nucleus to mediate mechanotransduction through gene transcription . EHD2 is also required to maintain the caveolae reservoir at the plasma mem - brane under membrane tension variations . Thus , EHD2 plays a pivotal role in the cell adaptation to mechanical perturbations by connecting caveolae mechanosensing at the plasma membrane with the regulation of gene transcription .

EHD2 links caveolae mechanosensing with gene transcription 4093 including Cav1 and cavins ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ; Gambin et al . , 2013 ) . We hypothesized that the release of caveolae components into the cytosol could mediate mechanotransduction events ( Nassoy and Lamaze , 2012 ; Lamaze et al . , 2017 ) . We monitored the fate of cavin1 and EHD2 because these two peripheral proteins of caveolae bear nuclear localization signals and can undergo nu - cleocytoplasmic shuttling ( Pekar et al . , 2012 ; Nassar and Parat , 2015 ) . ATP hydrolysis drives EHD2 oligomerization at the neck of caveolae , where it controls their stability through anchoring to the actin cytoskeleton ( Morén et al . , 2012 ; Stoeber et al . , 2012 ) . Cavin1 / PTRF is the first identified member of the cavin family that participates in the formation of the cytoplasmic coat of cav - eolae ( Ludwig et al . , 2013 ; Kovtun et al . , 2014 ) . Under resting conditions , EHD2 was present at the plasma membrane of HeLa cells , where it colocalized with ∼ 50 – 60 % of Cav1 puncta , as previously shown ( Fig . S2 A ; Morén et al . , 2012 ; Stoeber et al . , 2012 ) . As expected , a fraction of EHD2 was pres - ent in the nucleus ( Fig . 1 A ; Pekar et al . , 2012 ) . Repeated cycles of cell stretching and relaxation led to a moderate ( ≈10 % ) , albeit significant , increase of the EHD2 signal in the nucleus . A frac - tion of cavin1 , which bears two nuclear localization signals , was also present in the nucleus at steady state . No further increase of nuclear cavin1 was measurable upon cyclic stretch ( Fig . 1 B ) . We also followed the intracellular fate of EHD2 under acute disas - sembly of caveolae induced by hypo - osmotic shock ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) . After 5 min of hypo - osmotic shock ( Hypo ) , we measured a significantly higher ( ≈45 % ) increase in EHD2 nuclear trans - location . In contrast , Cav1 was not translocated to the nucleus upon mechanical stress ( Figs . 1 C and S1 A ) . EHD2 nuclear trans - location increased with the hypo - osmotic shock strength ( Fig . S1 A ) . We followed EHD2 dynamics in live cells in 3D with lattice light sheet microscopy ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . During the course of the hypo - osmotic shock , the amount of nuclear EHD2 increased rapidly , reaching a plateau in ∼ 100 s ( Fig . S1 C and Video 1 ) . Upon return to iso - osmotic conditions , the caveolae reservoir is rapidly reassembled at the plasma membrane ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) . Under this condition ( Rec ) , the amount of nuclear EHD2 decreased to a level slightly below steady state ( Figs . 1 C and S1 A ) . We quantified the amount of endogenous EHD2 present in the nuclear , cytoplasmic , and membrane fractions of cellular protein extracts from mouse lung endothelial cells ( MLECs ) . At steady state , EHD2 was distributed between the nuclear , cyto - plasmic , and membrane fractions of MLEC WT cells having ca - veolae ( Fig . 1 D ) . Hypo - osmotic shock led again to a significant increase of EHD2 nuclear content and a concomitant decrease in the membrane fractions , whereas the cytoplasmic fraction remained constant . In contrast , the initial distribution of EHD2 was not significantly changed by hypo - osmotic shock in MLEC Cav1 − / − cells devoid of caveolae , indicating that functional cav - eolae were required for EHD2 nuclear translocation induced by mechanical stress ( Fig . 1 D ) . Similarly , a lack of EHD2 - mCherry nuclear translocation was observed in HeLa Cav1 − / − cells ( Fig . S1 B ) . In these cells , the amount of nuclear EHD2 - mCherry was higher , suggesting that the association of EHD2 with caveolae at the plasma membrane prevents its nuclear translocation . Finally , total internal reflection microscopy ( TIRF ) live - cell im - aging showed that dually labeled Cav1 and EHD2 puncta synchro - nously disappeared from the plasma membrane with the same amplitude under hypo - osmotic shock , implying that EHD2 was released during caveolae disassembly ( Fig . S2 A ) . These obser - vations clearly demonstrate that the mechanical disassembly of caveolae at the plasma membrane results in the translocation of EHD2 to the nucleus . Mechanical stress results in EHD2 SUMOylation We next investigated which possible posttranslational modifi - cations of EHD2 could be associated with its mechanical release from caveolae . EHD2 was reported to be SUMOylated by SUMO1 ( small ubiquitin - like modifier ) on Lys 315 , which , when mutated , resulted in EHD2 nuclear accumulation ( Pekar et al . , 2012 ) . Pro - tein SUMOylation has clearly been associated with nucleocyto - plasmic transport and the response to different types of stresses , including osmotic stress ( Geiss - Friedlander and Melchior , 2007 ; Enserink , 2015 ) . We first explored the interaction between endog - enous EHD2 and SUMO using the proximal ligation assay ( PLA ; Söderberg et al . , 2006 ) . In Hs578T cells , which present substantial amounts of caveolae ( see Fig . 5 , A – C ) , PLA confirmed that endoge - nous EHD2 was SUMOylated by SUMO1 ( Fig . S2 B ) . At steady state , a significant amount of EHD2 - SUMO1 was localized in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm and at the plasma mem - brane . Hypo - osmotic shock did not increase EHD2 SUMOylation but led to a significant relocation of EHD2 - SUMO1 in the nucleus . We also analyzed the possible SUMOylation of EHD2 by SUMO2 / 3 and found minimal levels of EHD2 - SUMO2 / 3 under resting condi - tions ( Fig . 2 A ) . Unlike SUMO1 , however , hypo - osmotic shock led to a general increase of the cellular amount of EHD2 - SUMO2 / 3 , with a significant increase in nuclear EHD2 - SUMO2 / 3 ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . We confirmed EHD2 SUMOylation biochemically by trans - fecting EHD2 - GFP in HeLa cells stably expressing His - SUMO2 / 3 . The amount of EHD2 - SUMO2 / 3 , minimal under resting condi - tions , increased again after hypo - osmotic shock ( Fig . 2 C ) . We also measured EHD2 SUMOylation after mechanical stress release when the initial number of caveolae has fully re - covered . We found a significant decrease of both EHD2 - SUMO1 and EHD2 - SUMO2 / 3 , especially in the nucleus , suggesting that EHD2 deSUMOylation had occurred ( Figs . 2 A and S2 B ) . Fi - nally , we analyzed the EHD2 SUMOylation deficient mutant KK315 - 316AA , previously shown to accumulate in the nucleus , implying that EHD2 - SUMOylation controlled EHD2 nuclear exit ( Pekar et al . , 2012 ) . The EHD2 - KK315 - 316AA mutant disappeared synchronously with Cav1 from the plasma membrane under hy - po - osmotic shock but was unable to relocate to caveolae after shock release ( Fig . S2 A ) . Finally , no increase in EHD2 - SUMOy - lation was measurable in MLEC Cav1 − / − cells ( Fig . 2 D ) , indicating that the pool of EHD2 that is SUMOylated under hypo - osmotic shock is the pool that was initially associated with caveolae at the plasma membrane . Together , these data show that the cycle of EHD2 SUMOylation is controlled by mechanical stress and plays a key role in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of EHD2 . EHD2 controls gene transcription under mechanical stress To address the functional significance of EHD2 nuclear transloca - tion , we used gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ; Subramanian et al . , 2005 ) to compare the transcriptome of Hs578T cells Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201801122 Torrino et al .

Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201801122 Torrino et al . EHD2 links caveolae mechanosensing with gene transcription 4096 negatively regulated . Although cyclic stretching did not result in major changes in the pattern of gene set enrichment modified by EHD2 silencing , differences in the regulation of gene sets encod - ing transcription factors and cell division were further shown . We next measured mRNA levels of caveolae constituents by reverse - transcription quantitative PCR ( RT - qPCR ) in HeLa cells under mechanical stress . Cyclic stretch led to a significant de - crease of caveolae constituent transcripts , i . e . , Cav1 , Cav2 , cavin1 , and cavin2 , without affecting transcripts of flotillin - 1 ( Flot1 ) , a related membrane protein assembling microdomains distinct from caveolae at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3 B ) . Similar data were obtained under hypo - osmotic shock ( Fig . S2 C ) . Impor - tantly , no modification of transcript levels was detected in cells depleted of EHD2 ( Figs . 3 B and S2 C ) , and a siEHD2 - resistant variant fully rescued the regulation of caveolae constituent genes in EHD2 - depleted cells ( Fig . S2 C ) . The mechanical regulation of caveolae constituent gene transcription by EHD2 was no longer observed in Cav1 - depleted cells , confirming that the nuclear translocation of EHD2 and its impact on gene transcription re - quires the disassembly of functional caveolae ( Fig . S2 D ) . Finally , the repression activity of EHD2 on transcription was mediated by Krüppel - like factor 7 ( KLF7 ) and modulator of KLF7 activity ( MOKA ; Fig . 3 C ) , two known partners of EHD2 - regulated tran - scription ( Pekar et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly , KLF7 was found to bind to several enhancers of caveolae constituent genes in dif - ferent cell lines ( Fig . S2 E ) . EHD2 stabilizes caveolae during membrane tension variations We next analyzed the role of EHD2 in caveolae dynamics using TIRF and found , as previously published ( Morén et al . , 2012 ; Stoeber et al . , 2012 ; Yeow et al . , 2017 ) , that EHD2 depletion did not change the number of Cav1 spots present at the plasma mem - brane under resting conditions . Whereas EHD2 depletion had no effect on the extent of caveolae disassembly under hypo - osmotic shock , the reassembly of caveolae , which normally occurs imme - diately after the release of mechanical stress , was significantly reduced ( Fig . 3 D ) . Expression of the dominant - negative EHD2 - T72A mutant ( unable to bind ATP ) also reduced caveolae recovery after mechanical stress release . Conversely , expression of wild - type EHD2 , EHD2 - I157Q constitutively active mutant ( with ac - celerated ATP hydrolysis ) , or a siEHD2 - resistant variant allowed caveolae reassembly ( Figs . 3 E and S3 A ) . Finally , depletion or overexpression of Pacsin2 and filamin A , proteins that link ca - veolae to the actin cytoskeleton , did not affect the reassembly of caveolae after mechanical stress release ( Fig . S3 , B and C ) . We next examined the role of EHD2 under membrane tension variations by measuring the effective membrane tension using the tether pulling technique as described previously ( Sheetz , 2001 ; Sinha et al . , 2011 ) . HeLa cells were first exposed to a 5 - min hypo - osmotic shock ( 150 mOsm ) to increase membrane tension , and then to iso - osmolarity for 5 min to allow the return of mem - brane tension to homeostasis ( Rec condition ) . By recording the mean variations of the tether force ΔF over the initial force F iso measured in isotonic conditions , we found , as expected for cells having functional caveolae ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) , that the increase of membrane tension induced by hypo - osmotic shock was buff - ered , as F hypo remained almost identical to F iso ( Fig . 3 F ) . When cells were depleted of EHD2 , there was a slight but not significant increase in membrane tension , in agreement with our finding that EHD2 depletion did not change the extent of caveolae dis - assembly induced by hypo - osmotic shock ( Fig . 3 F ) . 5 min after return to iso - osmolarity ( Rec ) , the membrane tension of control cells had not yet returned to the initial value measured before stress , as indicated by the negative value of the tether force ΔF . In EHD2 - depleted cells , however , we measured a drastically smaller value of membrane tension , indicating a stronger delay in the re - turn to membrane tension homeostasis ( Fig . 3 F ) . We also found that repeated cycles of stretching and relaxation led to a slight but significant decrease of the number of caveolae at the plasma membrane in cells depleted of EHD2 ( Fig . 3 G ) . Altogether , these data indicate that EHD2 is required for maintaining a functional reservoir of caveolae at the plasma membrane , which buffers the variations of membrane tension during mechanical stress . Loss of EHD2 expression impairs caveolae mechanosensing and gene transcription Low EHD2 expression was recently reported in several solid tu - mors ( Li et al . , 2013 ; Shi et al . , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2015 ; Liu et al . , 2016 ) . Whether low EHD2 expression was also associated with defects in caveolae stabilization and nuclear translocation was not investigated in those studies . Given the importance of the mechanical microenvironment in tumor progression ( DuFort et al . , 2011 ) and the association of Cav1 with tumorogenesis ( Goetz et al . , 2008 ; Lamaze and Torrino , 2015 ) , we investigated cave - olae mechanics in breast cancer cell lines . We measured EHD2 mRNA levels in several normal and cancerous breast epithelial cell lines and selected Hs578T and MDA - MB - 436 , two triple - neg - ative basal - like breast cancer cell lines that express high and minimal levels of EHD2 transcripts , respectively . Immunoblot analyses confirmed similar amounts of Cav1 and cavin1 proteins in Hs578T and MDA - MB - 436 cells , whereas EHD2 was expressed in Hs578T but undetectable in MDA - MB - 436 cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . We first investigated the dynamics of caveolae under me - chanical stress by TIRF microscopy . In agreement with the dis - assembly of caveolae induced by higher membrane tension , we observed a rapid and significant decrease of Cav1 spots at the cell surface of Hs578T cells after exposure to a hypo - osmotic shock ( Fig . 4 B ) . In contrast , the number of Cav1 spots remained iden - tical in MDA - MB - 436 cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . However , when EHD2 was expressed in MDA - MB - 436 cells , a strong decrease in cell sur - face Cav1 spot numbers was observed again under hypo - osmotic shock ( Fig . 4 D ) . We next addressed whether this defect in caveolae mechano - sensing was also associated with defects in gene transcription regulation . MDA - MB - 436 cells did not show any variation in the level of caveolae component transcription under mechan - ical stress , whereas the reexpression of EHD2 , but not Cav1 , restored this control ( Fig . 4 E ) . Importantly , the restoration of this control required caveolae , as it was no longer observed when EHD2 - transfected MDA - MB - 436 cells were depleted of Cav1 ( Fig . 4 E ) . Whereas cyclic stretch led to a decrease of ca - veolae component transcripts in Hs578T cells , EHD2 depletion suppressed this control ( Fig . 4 F ) . Similar results were observed in cells depleted of Cav1 . Altogether , these data confirm that Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201801122 Torrino et al .

EHD2 links caveolae mechanosensing with gene transcription 4098 functional caveolae are required for the mechanical control of gene transcription by EHD2 . To better understand how EHD2 controls the caveolae reser - voir in breast cancer cells , we analyzed the ultrastructure of ca - veolae on unroofed cells using metal replica EM . Consistent with high Cav1 and EHD2 expression , Hs578T cells displayed numer - ous budded caveolae ( Fig . 5 , A – C ) . In contrast , MDA - MB - 436 cells , which lack EHD2 , presented very few caveolae , if any , and most membrane invaginations were clathrin - coated pits ( Fig . 5 , D – F ) . Cav1 immunogold labeling on standard transmission electron micrographs confirmed the absence of caveolar invaginations in MDA - MB - 436 cells but revealed a significant amount of Cav1 proteins present at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5 J ) . In contrast , Cav1 proteins were always associated with bona fide caveolar invaginations in Hs578T cells . These results most likely explain the lack of caveolae disassembly observed in MDA - MB - 436 cells ( Fig . 4 C ) , because the Cav1 signal does not correspond to caveo - lar invaginations but to Cav1 clusters that are unlikely to flatten out under mechanical stress . Expressing EHD2 in MDA - MB - 436 cells was sufficient to reconstitute the reservoir of caveolae at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5 , G , H and I ) . EHD2 has not been involved in caveolae assembly ( Morén et al . , 2012 ; Stoeber et al . , Figure 4 .

EHD2 links caveolae mechanosensing with gene transcription 4099 2012 ; Hoernke et al . , 2017 ) ; therefore , it was unexpected that MDA - MB - 436 breast cancer cells do not have caveolae , because their level of Cav1 and cavin1 expression is similar to that of Hs578T cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . Our data strongly suggest that the absence of caveolae in breast cancer cells lacking EHD2 may represent a long - term consequence of the inability to stabilize the reservoir of caveolae under the changing mechanical environment expe - rienced by cancer cells in the tumor mass . In this context , it is interesting that a recent study showed that EHD proteins ( 1 , 2 , and 4 ) are functionally redundant and that only the absence of all three EHDs results in loss of caveolae under mechanical stress ( Yeow et al . , 2017 ) . We and others have established caveolae as key mechanosen - sors ( Gervásio et al . , 2011 ; Sinha et al . , 2011 ; Ariotti et al . , 2014 ; Cheng et al . , 2015 ; Lo et al . , 2015 ) . We reveal here that caveolae are also mechanotransducers , and that EHD2 is central to this new function . On the one hand , we show that ATP binding to EHD2 is required for assembling and stabilizing the reservoir of caveolae at the cell surface against the variations of membrane tension in - duced by mechanical stress . ATP binding allows EHD2 insertion into the plasma membrane , whereas ATP hydrolysis , possibly regulated by membrane curvature , is involved in EHD2 release ( Hoernke et al . , 2017 ) . It is tempting to propose that caveolae flattening could trigger ATP hydrolysis by EHD2 and thereby its release from the plasma membrane . On the other hand , we show that the release of EHD2 from mechanically disassembled cave - olae is rapidly followed by EHD2 nuclear translocation , where it regulates gene transcription . EHD2 SUMOylation , which is in - duced by mechanical stress , is a major regulator of EHD2 nucle - ocytoplasmic shuttling . Force - induced phosphorylation of Cav1 has been reported to regulate gene transcription of caveolae con - stituent biogenesis ( Joshi et al . , 2012 ) . Our new results on EHD2 SUMOylation further illustrate the key role of posttranslational modifications in the caveolae response to mechanical stress . EHD2 , which combines both mechanosensing and mechano - transducing activities , plays a central role in the mechanical cell response ( Fig . 5 K ) . Recent evidence shows that mechanical forces from both the tumor mass and its microenvironment can control cancer cells activity in vivo ( DuFort et al . , 2011 ; Fernández - Sánchez et al . , 2015 ) . Our study is the first report of a defect in caveolae mecha - nosensing and mechanotransduction in cancer cells and empha - sizes the importance of revisiting the classic cellular functions of caveolae and their constituents through their new role in cell mechanics .

HeLa His - SUMO2 cells were grown as HeLa cells with 1 µg / ml puromycin ( InvivoGen ) . MLECs ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) were maintained in EGM - 2 medium ( Lonza ) supplemented with 15 % FBS ( Hyclone ; GE Healthcare ) , 4 mM l - glutamine ( GIB CO BRL Life Technologies ) , 5 mM pyru - vate , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin . MDA - MB - 436 cells were grown at 37°C without CO 2 in Leibovitz’s L - 15 medium ( GIB CO BRL Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( GIB CO BRL Life Technologies ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( GIB CO BRL Life Technologies ) . Generation of HeLa Cav1 − / − cells Single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) designed to target exon 3 of human caveolin - 1 gene was selected and analyzed using online software Benchling . The selected guide ( 5′ - GTA TTT CGT CAC AGT GAA GG - 3′ ) was inserted into pSpCas9 ( BB ) 2A - Puro plasmid , which contains SpCas9 and sgRNA scaffold ( px459 v2 . 0 , Feng Zhang laboratory , Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard , Cambridge , MA ; available from Addgene as plasmid 62988 ) . 2 µg of plasmid was transfected using a single - cuvette Nucleofector device ( Lonza ) as per the manufacturer’s protocol . In brief , 80 % confluent HeLa cells were harvested , and 10 6 cells were resuspended in 100 µl complete solution R and transfected using Nucleofector program I - 013 . After transfection , cells were transferred to a 37°C , 5 % CO 2 incubator , selected for puromycin for 72 h , and sorted as single cells into 96 - well plates using a MoFlo Astrios cell sorter ( Beck - man Coulter ) . After clonal expansion , protein levels of clones were evaluated by Western immunoblotting . Cyclic stretch Cells were plated onto flexible - bottom plates ( UniFlex plates ; Flexcell International ) coated with fibronectin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and incubated at 37°C in a CO 2 incubator for 24 h before apply - ing cyclic mechanical stretch . The cells were subjected to cyclic stretch at 0 . 5 Hz during 30 min using a computer - controlled vac - uum stretch apparatus ( FX - 4000T Tension Plus System ; FlexCell International ) with a vacuum pressure sufficient to generate 10 % mechanical stretch . Replicate control samples were maintained under static conditions with no applied cyclic stretch . Hypo - osmotic shock Hypo - osmotic shock was performed by diluting growth medium with deionized water ( 1 : 9 dilution for 30 - mOsm hypo - osmotic shock and 1 : 1 for 150 mOsm hypo - osmotic shock ) . Lysate preparation and immunoblot Cells were lysed with sample buffer containing 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 4 mM DTT , and Tris , pH 6 . 8 . Lysates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated primary an - tibodies and HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies . Chemilu - minescence signal was revealed using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate or SuperSignal West Femto Sub - strate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Technologies ) . Acquisition and quantification were performed on a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System ( Bio - Rad ) . Nuclear , cytosolic , and membrane extraction Nuclear / cytoplasmic / membrane fractionation was conducted at resting conditions , at 2 and 5 min under hypo - osmotic shock ( 30 mOsm ) as indicated , using the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The cytoplasmic fraction contains soluble cytoplasmic contents ; the membrane fraction contains plasma , mitochondria , and ER / Golgi membranes ; and the nuclear fraction contains the soluble nuclear extract and chromatin - bound nuclear proteins . Lysates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted for lamin A / C as a marker of nuclear fraction , for Hsp90 as a marker of cytoplasmic fraction , and for CHC as a marker of membrane fraction . Fractions were quantified for protein content and nor - malized to the total cell lysate proteins . GFP - trap 16 h after transfection , cells were treated with 100 nM leptomy - cin - B ( Cell Signaling Technology ; 9676 ) for 6 h . At resting condi - tions or after 5 min of hypo - osmotic shock , cells were harvested and lysed in 150 mM Tris - Cl , pH 6 . 7 , 5 % SDS , and 30 % glycerol and then diluted 1 : 10 in PBS containing 0 . 5 % NP - 40 and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The lysates were then sonicated at 2× 10 - s pulse ( 20 s in total ) of 25 % amplitude . Cleared lysates ( 13 , 200 rpm , 10 min , 4°C ) were incubated over - night with GFPTrap - MA beads ( Chromotek ) at 4°C . Beads were washed three to five times with washing buffer ( 25 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 5 % glycerol ) and eluted by boiling in 2× sample buffer at 95°C for 10 min . The eluted frac - tions were analyzed by Western blot and probed for GFP to de - termine the total EHD2 - GFP pull - down level and for SUMO2 / 3 to measure SUMOylated EHD2 . Immunofluorescence and live - cell imaging Cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4 % PFA in PBS . After quenching with 50 mM NH 4 Cl ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and permeabilization with 0 . 5 % saponin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or 1 % Tri - ton X - 100 , cells were blocked with 5 % BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies before being mounted in Fluoromount - G mounting medium ( eBioscience ) . 2 µg / ml DAPI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used in mount - ing medium to counterstain nuclei . Images were acquired on a Leica DM 6000B inverted wide - field fluorescence microscope equipped with a HCX PL Apo 40× NA 1 . 25 oil - immersion objective and an EMC CD camera ( Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ ) . Nuclear translocation was quantified with ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) by calculating the nucleo - cytosolic ratio of EHD2 signal ( nuclei masks were realized with the DAPI staining ) . TIRF images were acquired by TIRF video microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a CFI Apo TIRF 100× NA 1 . 49 oil objective and an EMC CD camera ( Photometrics HQ2 ) . The quantification of sur - face Cav1 spots was realized by LabView as described in Sinha et al . ( 2011 ) . In brief , caveolae were detected from TIRF images by first applying on the raw image a local intensity threshold of window size varying from 8 × 8 to 64 × 64 pixels , depending on the quality of the image . Pixels clustering together were detected as particles depending on their connectivity . Holes within parti - cles , if any , were filled , connected particles were disconnected Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201801122 Torrino et al . EHD2 links caveolae mechanosensing with gene transcription 4102 by eroding boundaries , and finally particles were selected by size . For colocalization , images were analyzed with ImageJ and the JACoP plugin ( Bolte and Cordelières , 2006 ) . For live imag - ing , cells were maintained at 37°C and under 5 % CO 2 throughout the acquisition . Lattice light sheet microscopy ( LLSM ) imaging and intensity analysis Cells expressing Cav1 - HaloTag and EHD2 - mEmerald were im - aged using LLSM ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Image volumes of Cav1 - HaloTag – and EHD2 - mEmerald – labeled cells were recorded every 2 s , using a 10 - ms exposure in 30 mOsm hypo - osmotic environment for a total time of 5 min . All 3D datasets acquired were deskewed to account for the 31 . 8° angle of the detection ob - jective ( Nikon ) . After deskewing , deconvolution was performed using the Richardson – Lucy algorithm , and 4D visualization was performed using Vision 4D software ( Arivis ) . Intensity analy - sis is based on a custom script written in Matlab , using Image Processing Toolbox . For the segmentation algorithm , nucleus and cell masks were defined based on Cav1 deconvolved images . The cell contour for each time point and z - plane was calculated using Otsu ( Otsu , 1979 ) and Chan – Vese ( Chan and Vese , 2001 ) algorithms implemented in Matlab Image Processing Toolbox . Similar analysis was performed to estimate the nucleus contour . Intensity for each time point was calculated by integrating the defined cell and nucleus area of the deskewed images for all planes of EHD2 labeling . The ratio between nucleus and whole - cell intensity was estimated for each time point and fitted to a sigmoid equation in Prism software . PLA The PLA kit was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich , and the assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Cells were fixed in 4 % PFA for 10 min at room temperature , quenched in 50 mM NH 4 Cl for 10 min , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( wt / vol ) for 10 min , and blocked in PBS / BSA . Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 45 min in PBS / BSA . Cov - erslips were mounted in Fluoromount with DAPI to stain nuclei . PLA signals were visible as fluorescent dots and imaged using wide - field fluorescence inverted microscope Leica DM 6000B equipped with a HCX PL Apo 63× NA 1 . 32 oil - immersion objec - tive and an EMC CD camera ( Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ ) . Fluo - rescent dots were quantified using ImageJ . Cells and nuclei were delineated to create masks . After a maximum entropy threshold , the PLA dots were quantified in both masks with the ImageJ Analyze Particles plugin . Cytoplasmic and plasma membrane values were obtained by subtracting nuclear count from the cel - lular count . All counts were divided by the area in pixels . qPCR Cells were lysed using RNeasy Plus extraction kit from Qiagen at steady state or after 30 min of cyclic stretch . For hypo - osmotic shock experiments , cells were first exposed to 30 mOsm me - dium for 5 min , moved into iso - osmotic medium at 37°C during 1 h , and finally lysed using RNeasy Plus extraction kit . Reverse transcription reaction was performed with 1 , 000 ng total RNA per reaction using high - capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . qPCR was performed using 50 ng cDNA per 20 - µl reaction . TaqMan Gene Expression Assays from Ap - plied Biosystems were used : GAP DH ( Hs02758991 _ g1 ) , Cav1 ( Hs00971716 _ m1 ) , Cav2 ( Hs00184597 _ m1 ) , Cavin1 ( Hs00396859 _ m1 ) , Cavin2 ( Hs00190538 _ m1 ) , EHD2 ( Hs00907482 _ m1 ) , and Flot1 ( Hs00195134 _ m1 ) . Relative expression levels were calcu - lated using ΔΔCT method with fold changes calculated as 2 −ΔΔCT . GAP DH served as the internal control . DNA microarray Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus extraction kit after 30 min of cyclic stretch at 0 . 5 Hz . Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix Human Gene ST 2 . 1 arrays . Cel files were preprocessed and annotated using the oligo and clarioms - humanhttranscriptcluster . db packages . Normalization of expres - sion across chips was performed using the RMA algorithm ( rma ( ) function from oligo package ) . No outlier was observed after visual inspection using the hist ( ) and boxplot ( ) functions . For each con - dition , the mean log2 fold change ( logFC ) compared with control was computed using the Limma R package . These logFC tables were then used to perform GSEA ( Subramanian et al . , 2005 ) with default parameters using the GSEA java application ( v . 2 . 2 . 1 ) and the gene set databases available on http : / / software . broadinstitute . org / gsea / msigdb / . Analysis was performed using the GseaPre - ranked tool . Enrichments were considered significant if the cor - responding false discovery rate ( FDR ; BH correction ) was lower than 5 % . Data description , raw data files , and tables for logFC and FDR values have been deposited on http : / / microarrays . curie . fr / . Force measurements Plasma membrane tethers were extracted from cells with a bead ( 3 µm in diameter ; Polysciences ) coated with concanavalin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) trapped in optical tweezers . The optical twee - zers are made of a 1 , 064 - nm laser beam ( ytterbium fiber laser , λ = 1064 nm , TEM 00 , 5 W ; IPG Photonics ) expanded and steered ( optics by Elliot Scientific ) in the back focal plane of the micro - scope objective ( Apo - TIRF 100× , NA 1 . 45 ; Nikon ) . The whole setup was mounted on a Nikon Eclipse - Ti inverted microscope . The sample was illuminated by transmitted light , and videos were acquired at 10 Hz with an EMC CD camera ( iXon 897 ; Andor ) driven by Micro - Manager ( Edelstein et al . , 2014 ) . The fine move - ments and particularly the translational movement necessary to pull the membrane tether were performed using a custom - made stage mounted on a piezoelectric element ( P753 ; Physik Instru - mente ) driven by a servo controller ( E665 ; Physik Instrumente ) and a function generator ( Tektronix AFG320 ; Sony ) . Calibration was performed using an oscillatory modulation driven by a function generator ( Tolić - Nørrelykke et al . , 2006 ) and measuring the response of the bead to an oscillatory motion of the stage . We measured k = 22P pN / ( µm ⋅ W ) , where P is the laser power . This relationship is linear in the laser power range used for the experiments ( 0 . 5 – 2 W ) . The membrane tether was held at constant length to measure the static force . For measuring membrane tension changes due to hypo - osmotic shock , the tether was held while the medium was diluted until the osmolarity reached 150 mOsm . For assessing the membrane tension change during recovery , medium osmolarity Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201801122 Torrino et al . EHD2 links caveolae mechanosensing with gene transcription 4103 was adjusted back to 300 mOsm with 10× MEM ( GIB CO BRL Life Technologies ) . The medium changes were performed by slowly flowing in water or 10× MEM using a 2 - ml surgical syringe . The position of the beads used to compute tether forces was detected from the images using a custom ImageJ macro . EM Cells were fixed at 37°C with 2 % PFA in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer . After several washes and quenching with glycine , cells were harvested in 10 % gelatin , pelleted by mild centrifugation , and incubated on ice for 2 h . Afterward , pelleted cells were incu - bated overnight at 4°C in 2 . 3 M sucrose and mounted on nails in liquid nitrogen . 65 - nm ultrathin cryosections were obtained using a Leica UCT ultracryomicrotome and collected on Cu / Pd - formvar - carbon – coated grids by picking up in a 1 : 1 mix of 2 . 3 M sucrose and methylcellulose . The sections were processed for immunogold labeling with an anti - Cav1 polyclonal antibody and Protein A conjugated to 10 nm gold ( PAG10 ; https : / / www . cellbiology - utrecht . nl / ) as reported previously ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) . After each labeling , grids were extensively washed with PBS and fixed again with 1 % glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature . Contrast was obtained by incubation with a 9 : 1 mix of methylcellulose and 4 % uranyl acetate in water . Electron mi - crographs were acquired on a Tecnai Spirit electron microscope ( FEI ) equipped with a 4k CCD camera ( EMS IS ) . For unroofed metal replica EM , adherent plasma membranes from cultured cells grown on glass coverslips were disrupted by sonication as described previously ( Heuser , 2000 ) . Sample processing for platinum - replica EM of unroofed cells was per - formed as follows : glutaraldehyde / paraformaldehyde - fixed cells were further sequentially treated with osmium tetroxide , tannic acid , and uranyl acetate before ethanol dehydration and hexam - ethyldisilazane drying ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Dried samples were then rotary - shadowed with ∼ 2 nm platinum and 8 nm carbon . The resultant platinum replica was floated off the glass by angled immersion into hydrofluoric acid ( 5 % ) , washed several times by flotation on distilled water , and picked up on 200 - mesh form - var / carbon - coated EM grids . The grids were mounted in a eu - centric side - entry goniometer stage of a transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV ( model CM120 ; Philips ) , replicas were viewed at ±10° tilt angles , and images were recorded with a Morada digital camera ( Olympus ) . Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop to adjust brightness and contrast and pre - sented in inverted contrast . Anaglyphs were made by converting the −10° tilt image to red and the + 10° tilt image to cyan ( blue / green ) , layering them on top of each other using the screen blend - ing mode in Adobe Photoshop , and aligning them to each other . Statistical analyses All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v . 6 . 0 and 7 . 0 for Windows ( GraphPad Software ) . Two - tailed t test was used if comparing only two conditions . For comparing more than two conditions , one - way ANO VA was used with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test or Dunnett’s multiple comparison test ( if com - paring all conditions to the control condition ) . Significance of mean comparison is marked on the graphs by asterisks . Error bars denote SEM or SD . Online supplemental material Fig .
