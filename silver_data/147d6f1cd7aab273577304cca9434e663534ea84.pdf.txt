This phenomenon is labeled as serial order e ﬀ ect in DT . The present study investigated whether di ﬀ erent executive processes ( i . e . , updating , shifting , and inhibition ) speci ﬁ cally contribute to the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT . Participants ' executive functions were measured by corresponding experimental tasks outside of the EEG lab . They were required to generate original uses of conventional objects ( alternative uses task ) during EEG recording . The behavioral results revealed that the originality of ideas was higher in later stage of DT ( i . e . , Epoch 2 ) than in its earlier stage ( i . e . , Epoch 1 ) for higher - shifting individuals , but showed no di ﬀ erence between two epochs for lower - shifting individuals . The EEG results revealed that lower - inhibition individuals showed stronger upper alpha ( 10 – 13 Hz ) synchronization in left frontal areas during Epoch 1 compared to during Epoch 2 . For higher - inhibition individuals , no changes in upper alpha activity from Epoch 1 to Epoch 2 were found . These ﬁ ndings indicated that shifting and inhibition contributed to create a serial order e ﬀ ect in DT , perhaps because individuals suppress interference from obvious ideas and switch to new idea categories during DT , thus more original ideas appear as time passes by . 1 . Introduction Divergent thinking ( DT ) is a facet of cognition that leads in various directions ( Runco , 1999 ) . It is usually referred to as a thought process used to generate original ideas by exploring diverse possible solutions , which is involved in many creative e ﬀ orts ( Kaufman et al . , 2008 ) . It was demonstrated that during the course of DT , the number of ideas decreases while the originality of ideas increases ( Johns et al . , 2001 ; Milgram and Rabkin , 1980 ; Phillips and Torrance , 1977 ; Runco , 1986 ; Ward , 1968 ) . This phenomenon has been labeled as serial order e ﬀ ect and was ﬁ rst introduced by Christensen and his colleagues ( Christensen et al . , 1957 ) . The present study aimed to investigate whether di ﬀ erent executive processes speci ﬁ cally contribute to the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT , and explore electroencephaographical ( EEG ) correlates underlying the e ﬀ ects of executive processes on the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT . 1 . 1 . Executive processes and divergent thinking Divergent thinking is , according to the controlled - attention theory of creative cognition ( Beaty et al . , 2014b ) , a top - down process that involves executive processes ( see also Runco , 1994 ) . Previous studies revealed that some control processes a ﬀ ected DT performance , such as ﬂ uid intelligence ( Beaty et al . , 2014b ; Jauk et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) and working memory capacity ( De Dreu et al . , 2012 ; Hao et al . , 2015 ; Lee and Therriault , 2013 ) . Recent psychometric studies demonstrated that inhibitory function had positive correlation with DT performance ( Benedek et al . , 2012 ) , and DT performance was positively predicted by both inhibitory and updating functions ( Benedek et al . , 2014a ) . Furthermore , more creative individuals exhibited higher levels of inhibition than less creative individuals ( Edl et al . , 2014 ) . Plenty of EEG studies revealed that EEG activity in the alpha band was highly sensitive to certain creativity - related factors ( see Fink and Benedek , 2014 ) . First , the performance of creativity - demanding tasks induces stronger event - related synchronization of alpha ( ERS ; i . e . , task - related band power increases relative to baseline ) than the performance of “ convergent ” or intelligence - related tasks ( Bazanova and Aftanas , 2008 ; Fink et al . , 2007 , 2009a ; Martindale and Hasenfus , 1978 ) . Likewise , alpha ERS was found to be related to divergent rather than convergent modes of thinking within the same task ( Jauk et al . , 2012 ) . Second , more original ideas were accompanied by a stronger alpha activity at the central - parietal ( and to some minor extent also at the anterior - frontal ) sites ( Fink and Neubauer , 2006 ; Grabner et al . , 2007 ) . Third , alpha ERS correlated with an individual ' s creative level ( i . e . , more creative individuals showing stronger alpha power than less creative ones when performing creativity tasks ) ( Fink et al . , 2009a , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . neuropsychologia . 2017 . 03 . 001 Received 27 July 2016 ; Received in revised form 22 February 2017 ; Accepted 1 March 2017 ⁎ Corresponding authors .

MARK 2009b ; Jausovec and Jausovec , 2000 ; Martindale et al . , 1984 ) . Fourth , alpha ERS was sensitive to a verbal creativity training ( Fink et al . , 2006 ) and to short - lasting creativity interventions ( i . e . , exposure to other people ' s ideas and induction of positive a ﬀ ection ) ( Fink et al . , 2011 ) . Fifth , enhancing alpha power of the frontal cortex using 10 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation ( 10 Hz - tACS ) increased facets of creativity , but 40 Hz - tACS unfolded no e ﬀ ects , which suggests that alpha activity in frontal brain areas is selectively involved in creativity ( Lustenberger et al . , 2015 ) . Notably , Alpha ERS has tradi - tionally been considered to re ﬂ ect cortical deactivation ( Pfurtscheller and da Silva , 1999 ) , whereas alpha event - related de - synchronization ( ERD ; i . e . , band power decreases ) re ﬂ ects cortical activation ( Klimesch , 1999 ) . However , alpha ERS has recently been found to re ﬂ ect a form of top - down activity ( Payne and Sekuler , 2014 ; von Stein and Sarnthein , 2000 ) , such as the inhibition of interfering memories ( Hanslmayr et al . , 2011 ; Jensen and Mazaheri , 2010 ; Klimesch et al . , 2007 ) , or a state of heightened internal attention ( Benedek et al . , 2011 , 2014b ; Fink and Woschnjak , 2011 ; Handel et al . , 2011 ; Jaarsveld et al . , 2015 ; Klimesch et al . , 2007 ) . Hence , the aforementioned EEG researches support the important roles of executive processes in DT . Recent fMRI studies also indicated that executive processes were involved in DT . Beaty et al . ( 2015 ) assessed dynamic interactions between brain regions ( e . g . , the default - mode , control , and salience networks ) during DT . The results revealed that the posterior cingulate cortex ( PCC ) showed increased coupling with regions of the control network ( i . e . , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , DLPFC ) and salience network ( i . e . , bilateral insula ) . Moreover , the dynamic interaction between these networks depended on the stage of DT ; that is , the PCC showed early coupling with the right anterior insula and later coupling with the right DLPFC . Similarly , Beaty et al . ( 2017 ) investi - gated dynamic interactions between the default - mode , control and salience networks in solving a verb generation task ( a DT task ) . They found that the default - mode and control networks exhibited strong functional connectivity when participants solving task in the high - constraint ( i . e . , high semantic interference ) condition . These ﬁ ndings suggest that interactions between the default and control networks may underlie response inhibition during constrained idea production . Another fMRI study demonstrated that the originality of DT responses ( accessed by trained raters ) predicted increased functional coupling of the ventral ACC and the left angular gyrus ( Mayseless et al . , 2015 ) , which are regions involved in cognitive control and self - generated thoughts , respectively . The important roles of the control network in DT are also supported by the resting - state fMRI studies . Beaty et al . ( 2014a ) examined resting - state network patterns in people with better DT ability . The results revealed that highly creative participants showed increased coupling of default network regions with the left inferior frontal gyrus , a region associated with cognitive control that is widely implicated in studies of DT . Zhu et al . ( 2017 ) used functional connectivity analysis of resting - state fMRI data to investigate visual and verbal creativity - related regions and networks . They found the strength of connectivity between the default network and the control network was positively related to both creative domains . In a recent review , Beaty and his colleagues ( Beaty et al . , 2016 ) proposed that the default network contribute to the generation of candidate ideas ( potentially useful information derived from long - term memory ) in light of its role in self - generated cognition , while the control network would often be required to evaluate the e ﬃ cacy of candidate ideas and modify them to meet the constraints of task - speci ﬁ c goals . Such a proposal was highlighted in another review ( Zabelina and Andrews - Hanna , 2016 ) , in which it suggests DT , especially its later stages , may bene ﬁ t from the dynamic cooperation of the default network and control network . 1 . 2 . Possible e ﬀ ects of executive processes on the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT Why does the number of ideas decrease but the originality of ideas increase during the course of DT ? According to the associative model of creativity ( Mednick , 1962 ) , DT is considered as a process of spreading activation through related semantic networks . The neighboring ideas in the semantic network are usually thought as being common and less creative , while the more remote ideas are regarded to be more unusual and creative . Understandably , it takes some time for distant associa - tions or concepts to be activated and connected ; creative ideas may hence emerge later than more common ideas , and ideas become increasingly sparse as time passes by . In this vein , the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT re ﬂ ects the gradual spreading of activation towards increasingly remote associations ( Beaty and Silvia , 2012 ; Wallach and Kogan , 1965 ) . However , some executive processes may also account for the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT . First , executive switching helps individuals stop generating ideas in one category and switch to another category , which could create a serial e ﬀ ect . More speci ﬁ cally , people typically start with a salient and obvious category in solving the DT problems . Once the category is exhausted , they need to stop the search process , switch to a new category , and then construct responses within it . Previous studies revealed that some people ( those with lower intelligence and working memory span ) had di ﬃ culties in such deliberate control of cognition ; they switch less often and hence have fewer ideas in verbal ﬂ uency tasks ( Unsworth et al . , 2011 ) and less creative ideas in DT tasks ( Nusbaum and Silvia , 2011a ) . Understandably , if people ﬁ rst exhaust an obvious category and then stop and switch to new idea categories , their later responses will be better than their earlier responses . Second , executive inhibition helps suppress task - irrelevant information ( Carson et al . , 2003 ; Klimesch , 2012 ) , which could also create a serial order e ﬀ ect . That is , obvious , common ideas come to mind ﬁ rst ; as time passes , more original ideas appear when people overcome interference from obvious ideas and early responses . This proposal was supported by a recent study ( Beaty and Silvia , 2012 ) , in which participants were asked to solve a verbal DT problem in 10 min . The results showed that compared to participants with lower ﬂ uid intelligence ( i . e . , Gf ) , participants with higher Gf started with more original ideas , and the originality of their ideas remained at a high level of quality across time . The authors suggested that this e ﬀ ect might be driven by executive mechanisms ; that is , participants with higher Gf can inhibit the salient but unoriginal ideas that typically come to mind at the beginning of DT ( Beaty and Silvia , 2012 ) . Third , updating supports the active main - tenance of task - relevant information and the controlled search from memory ( Unsworth and Engle , 2007 ) , which could create a serial order e ﬀ ect as well . It is known that creative ideas originate from the successful association of previously unrelated concepts taken from memory ( Mednick , 1962 ) . Fertile strategies for idea generation involve the controlled search and selective retrieval from memory . Updating is involved in the identi ﬁ cation and maintenance of relevant cues that help delimiting the actual search set ( Unsworth and Engle , 2007 ) . From the point of view , updating may help people continue to retrieve semantically remote but useful concepts from memory , and then produce more creative ideas as time passes by . 1 . 3 . The present study Up to now , it is still an open question how executive processes play roles in the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT . The present study aimed to investigate whether di ﬀ erent executive processes ( i . e . , updating , shift - ing , and inhibition ) speci ﬁ cally contribute to the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT , and explore the EEG correlates underlying the e ﬀ ects of executive processes on the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT . We particularly addressed two questions . First , are brain activity patterns di ﬀ erent between the earlier and later stages of DT , which may re ﬂ ect di ﬀ erent roles of M . Wang et al . Neuropsychologia 99 ( 2017 ) 92 – 100 93 executive processes involved in DT as time passes ? Second , do individuals ' executive functions ( EFs ) levels in ﬂ uence brain activity patterns in the earlier and later stages of DT ? Since temporal change is a critical factor in this study , we preferred to use electroencephalo - graphy ( EEG ) to record brain activity during the course of DT , given its high temporal resolution . In the present study , participants were required to solve the Alternative Uses Task ( Guilford , 1967 ) problems . The AUT is a typical verbal DT task . The participants were instructed to report their answers one by one as soon as they got it . The EEG activity during solving the AUT problems was recorded . After the EEG recording session , parti - cipants ’ executive functions were measured by means of corresponding experimental tasks outside of the EEG lab ( i . e . , updating : the letter - memory task ; shifting : the number - letter task ; inhibition : the Stroop task ) . The ﬂ uency and originality of the generated ideas were compared between the earlier and later stages during the course of DT , as well as between individuals with higher and lower EFs . Given that the signals in several frequency bands , such as the theta ( 4 – 8 Hz ) , alpha ( 8 – 13 Hz ) , and beta ( 13 – 30 Hz ) bands , are associated with creative thinking ( see Dietrich and Kanso , 2010 ) , EEG activity in theta , alpha , and beta bands were compared between the earlier and later stages during DT , and between individuals with higher and lower EFs . We predicted that , ( 1 ) the number of ideas would decrease but the originality of ideas would increase when solving the AUT problems , ( 2 ) EEG alpha activity in the earlier and later stages when solving the AUT problems would be distinctive ( probably most prominent in the frontal cortex ) , and ( 3 ) such EEG alpha activity would be in ﬂ uenced by individuals ’ executive function levels . Because only several studies have explored EEG beta or theta activity in creative thinking and the ﬁ ndings were contradictory ( see Dietrich and Kanso , 2010 ) , we could not propose precise predictions for EEG beta or theta activity before our experiment . 2 . Method 2 . 1 . Participants Thirty - ﬁ ve right - handed undergraduates ( 10 males , 25 females ; in the range between 19 and 26 years , M = 22 . 6 , SD = 2 . 02 ) participated in this study . They were all native Chinese speakers . They reported no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases , had normal or corrected to normal vision . Participants received 15 dollars as compensation for their participation . They signed informed consent at the beginning of the experiment . The procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee of East China Normal University . Due to technical problems , the data of 11 participants were excluded from the EEG analyses . This left a ﬁ nal EEG sample of 24 participants ( 7 male ) with an average age of 22 . 01 years old ( SD = 2 . 09 ; range from 19 to 26 years old ) . 2 . 2 . Experimental tasks The Alternative Uses Task ( AUT ) ( Guilford , 1967 ) was used as the experimental task . It required respondents to generate as many unusual or original uses as possible for common objects , such as a paperclip ( “ making a ring ” , “ cleaning ﬁ ngernails ” ) . The AUT is a typical DT task and a well - established test of creative potential ( Guilford , 1967 ; Runco , 1999 ; Runco and Mraz , 1992 ) . Performance on this task has been found to be a reliable predictor of actual , real - world creative performance ( Runco and Acar , 2012 ) . The letter - memory task ( Miyake et al . , 2000 ; Morris and Jones , 1990 ) was used to assess “ updating ” function . In this task , several letters were presented serially for 1500 ms per letter . The task was simply to recall the last 4 letters presented in the list . To ensure that the task required continuous updating , the instructions required the participants to rehearse out loud the last 4 letters by mentally adding the most recent letter and dropping the 5th letter back and then speaking the new string of 4 letters out loud . For example , if the letters presented were ‘‘ T , H , G , B , S , K , R , ’’ the participants should have said , ‘‘ T … TH … THG … THGB … HGBS … GBSK … BSKR ’’ and then recalled ‘‘ BSKR ’’ at the end of the trial . The participants performed 12 trials for a total of 48 letters recalled . The dependent measure was the propor - tion of letters recalled correctly . The number - letter task ( Rogers and Monsell , 1995 ; Spector and Biederman , 1976 ) was selected to assess “ shifting ” function . In this task , number - letter pairs ( e . g . , 8G ) were presented in one of the four quadrants of the computer screen in a clockwise order . Participants were required to switch between two subtasks . They were asked to indicate whether the number was odd or even when the stimulus was presented in one of the upper two quadrants , and to indicate whether the letter was a consonant or vowel when it was in one of the bottom two quadrants . Participants thus had to switch tasks in half of the trials ( i . e . , trials from the upper left and lower right quadrants ) . The shift cost for this task was the di ﬀ erence between the average RTs of the trials in the third block that required a mental shift ( trials from the upper left and lower right quadrants ) and the average RTs of the trials from the ﬁ rst two blocks in which no shift was necessary . A smaller shift cost was taken to indicate more e ﬀ ective executive shifting function . The Stroop color - word - interference task ( Stroop , 1935 ) is a proto - typical task used to measure the “ inhibition of prepotent responses ” ( Miyake et al . , 2000 ) . Prepotent response inhibition is thought to facilitate creative thought by suppressing interference caused by dominant response tendencies ( Benedek et al . , 2012 ; Gilhooly et al . , 2007 ) . Performance on the Stroop task was demonstrated to have positive correlations with creative performance ( Benedek et al . , 2014a ; Edl et al . , 2014 ; Golden , 1975 ; Groborz and Necka , 2003 ) . The Stroop task presents single words denoting either a color name ( “ red ” , “ green ” , “ blue ” , or “ yellow ” ) on a black computer screen . Participants were asked to name the color of the stimuli as fast as possible ( time - out = 4 s ) by entering one out of four keys associated with the color . The Stroop e ﬀ ect was scored for each block as the di ﬀ erence of the mean reaction time in incongruent and congruent trials , which was considered a reverse indicator of inhibitory ability . 2 . 3 . Experiment procedure The participants were required to solve eight AUT problems ( i . e . , pencil , key , clock , shoes , table , button , lipstick , mobile phone ) . The presented sequences of the eight AUT problems were randomly arranged by a computer for every participant . In solving an AUT problem , participants were encouraged to try their best to produce ideas that would be thought of by no one else , as suggested by Harrington ( 1975 ) , Runco and Pritzker ( 1999 ) . The procedure of solving an AUT problem ( i . e . , a trial ) is illustrated in Fig . 1 . Participants were required to work on a problem for 3 min . Before each AUT problem , there was a plus ( “ + ” ) lasting for 15 s for ﬁ xation . Then the AUT problem appeared on the computer screen . Once participants had an idea , they pressed the button SPACE , and then orally reported the idea . After reporting , participants pressed the button SPACE again , and continued to think about potential ideas . The oral responses for the AUT problems were recorded by a voice recorder and transcribed afterwards for further analysis . This session lasted for approximately 30 min . Afterwards , participants had a rest for 20 min , and then continued to perform the executive function tasks without EEG recording . The executive function tasks were also presented on the computer , which need approximately 45 min for participants to complete . 2 . 4 . Electrophysiological recording and analysis Participants sat in a comfortable chair in a quiet , dim - lighted room that was sound - proof and electromagnetic - proof . They were faced with a CRT screen at eye level . Thirty channels of EEG signals and two M . Wang et al . Neuropsychologia 99 ( 2017 ) 92 – 100 94 channels of electrooculography ( EOG ) signals ( horizontal and vertical eye movements ) were recorded by a 32 - channel BrainAmp ampli ﬁ er ( Brian Products GmbH , Munich , Germany ) , with the reference electro - des placed on the left and right mastoids . All electrode impedances were maintained below 10 k Ω . The EEG and EOG signals were ampli ﬁ ed , ﬁ ltered ( . 5 – 100 Hz band - pass ) , digitized ( 1000 Hz sampling rate ) , and stored for o ﬀ - line analysis . The EEG and EOG signals were recorded through each trial . EOG - contaminated elements among the EEG signals were removed by an infomax independent component analysis ( ICA ) method im - plemented in EEGLAB toolbox ( Swartz Center for Computational Neurosciences , US ) ( Delorme and Makeig , 2004 ) . Signals in all 32 channels were down - sampled to 250 Hz and used for ICA . Independent components ( ICs ) representing eye movement artifacts were selected by both topography and temporal activities , and were removed from the EEG signals ( Jung et al . , 2000 ) . Afterwards , the EEG data were re - referenced using the common average reference , and then divided into epochs as Baseline and Activations ( see Fig . 1 ) . The EEG signals were ﬁ rst ﬁ ltered by using an in ﬁ nite impulse response ( IIR ) band - pass ﬁ lter . Forward - and - reverse ﬁ ltering was used to avoid phase distortions . Ripple amplitudes in the pass band and stop band were set as . 0025 dB and 40 dB respectively . The ﬁ ltered data were then squared to obtain the band power values . In the theta ( 4 – 8 Hz ) , lower alpha ( 8 – 10 Hz ) , upper alpha ( 10 – 13 Hz ) , lower beta ( 13 – 20 Hz ) , upper beta ( 20 – 30 Hz ) frequency bands , ERD / ERS values of the activation periods were calculated as following equation ( Pfurtscheller and da Silva , 1999 ) . ERD / ERS = ( MP activation – MP baseline ) / MP baseline . As in a previous study ( Fink et al . , 2007 ) , the time periods for the spectrum calculation of Baseline were 10 , 000 ms ( i . e . , 2500 – 12 , 500 ms after the onset of Fixation ) . The time periods for the spectrum calculation of Activation were 1000 ms ( i . e . , − 1250 to − 250 ms before pressing the IDEA - button ) ( see Fig . 1 ) . 2 . 5 . Assessment of performance on AUT problems Participants ' performance on the AUT problem was measured by the scores of ﬂ uency and originality ( Guilford , 1967 ; Runco , 1991 ) . Fluency scores were based on the number of ideas given in the AUT problem . Originality scores were given by the subjective scoring method , following the procedures outlined in previous studies ( De Dreu et al . , 2012 ; Gilhooly et al . , 2012 ; Hocevar , 1979 ; Silvia , 2011 ) . First , ﬁ ve raters independently evaluated the originality for each idea reported by the participants on a 5 - point Likert scale ( 1 - not original at all , 5 - highly original ) . The inter - rater agreement ( ICCs = . 69 ) was acceptable . Then , the ratings for each single idea from the ﬁ ve raters were averaged into one originality score for each idea . 2 . 6 . De ﬁ ning the “ order ” for the ﬂ uency and originality scores Previous studies usually de ﬁ ned the “ order ” of ideas according to the “ time ” when the ideas were produced ( Beaty and Silvia , 2012 ) or the “ positions ” in which the ideas were located ( Christensen et al . , 1957 ) . For example , the ideas participants produced can be divided into the ﬁ rst and the second halves according to the “ positions ” ( e . g . , 8 ideas , the early 4 ideas into the ﬁ rst half , the later 4 ideas into the second half ) , or based on the “ time ” ( e . g . , 3 - min idea generation , the ideas produced in the ﬁ rst 1 . 5 min as the ﬁ rst half , those produced in the second 1 . 5 min as the second half ) . Creative performance ( e . g . , ﬂ uency and originality ) was then compared between two halves of ideas . Given that ﬂ uency refers to the quantity of ideas , the ﬂ uency scores in two halves of ideas would be exactly equal if the method of “ position ” was adopted . Therefore , we used the method of “ time ” to divide ideas , and then compared the di ﬀ erences of the ﬂ uency scores in the ﬁ rst half and the last half of 3 min . By contrast , we used the method of “ position ” rather than the method of “ time ” to de ﬁ ne the “ order ” for the originality scores . On the one hand , participants occasionally produced no idea in the second 1 . 5 min in this study ; thus , the originality of idea generation in the second 1 . 5 min could not been scored if the method of “ time ” was adopted . On the other hand , given that originality refers to the quality of ideas , it seems open - and - shut to explore the changes of ideas ’ originality from the beginning to the ending “ positions ” . It must be pointed out that participants produced a few of ideas ( M = 6 . 26 ; SD = 2 . 97 ) and the number of ideas varied considerably for every participant in the present study . In order to ensure numerical equivalence and temporal variation of the selected ideas , the ﬁ rst two ideas and last two ideas were grouped together respectively and represented the earlier epoch ( i . e . , Epoch 1 ) and the later epoch ( i . e . , Epoch 2 ) . Notably , in some trials , participants produced less than four ideas ( i . e . , 3 or 2 ideas ) . In this case , the ﬁ rst one and last one idea was selected to represent the Epoch 1 and 2 respectively . Moreover , eleven trials with only one idea were not included because one idea could not be split into the two halves . Therefore , participants got the ﬂ uency scores in the ﬁ rst and second 1 . 5 min and the originality scores in Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 for every AUT problem . Afterwards , the ﬂ uency scores in the ﬁ rst and second 1 . 5 min and the originality scores in Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 were averaged across 8 AUT problems for every participant . These scores were used to explore the e ﬀ ects of “ order ” on creative performance . In the same vein , the ERS / ERD values while participants generated the ﬁ rst and the last two ideas for each frequency band were averaged into Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 , respectively . 3 . Result 3 . 1 . Serial order e ﬀ ect of the ﬂ uency and originality scores The mean ﬂ uency score ( i . e . , the number of ideas ) of solving 8 AUT problems was 6 . 26 ( SD = 2 . 97 ) , in the range from 1 . 88 to 15 . 88 . Overall , participants produced more ideas ( M = 3 . 6 , SD = 1 . 64 ) in the ﬁ rst 1 . 5 min than in the second 1 . 5 min ( M = 2 . 68 , SD = 1 . 43 ) , t ( 34 ) = 6 . 83 , p < . 001 , Cohen ' s d = . 6 ( see Fig . 2A ) . Furthermore , the origin - ality scores were lower in Epoch 1 ( M = 1 . 94 , SD = . 24 ) than in Epoch 2 ( M = 2 . 13 , SD = . 23 ) , t ( 34 ) = 5 . 2 , p < . 001 , Cohen ' s d = . 81 ( see Fig . 2B ) . These results indicated that the ﬂ uency of ideas decreased but the originality of ideas increased during the course of DT . The serial order e ﬀ ect was con ﬁ rmed in this study . Fig . 1 . The procedure of solving an AUT problem . A 10 s time interval during the presentation of the ﬁ xation cross ( pre - stimulus reference interval R ) as well as a 1 s time interval 250 ms before pressing the IDEA - button ( activation interval A ) were used for EEG analyses . “ + ” = the ﬁ xation .

E ﬀ ects of “ order ” and executive functions on the ﬂ uency and originality scores According to performance on three EF tasks , participants were divided into two groups ( i . e . , higher and lower levels separated by median ) in the updating , shifting and inhibitory functions , respectively . These three between - subject factors were used in further ANOVA analyses . Three separate repeated measures ANOVAs with EPOCH as within - subject factor and inhibitory , shifting and updating functions ( higher vs . lower ) as between - subject factors were conducted on the originality scores , respectively . In three ANOVAs , the main e ﬀ ects of EPOCH were all signi ﬁ cant . That is , participants , no matter higher or lower executive functions , produced ideas with higher originality in Epoch 2 than in Epoch 1 . Interestingly , there was a signi ﬁ cant interaction e ﬀ ect of EPOCH × SHIFTING , F ( 1 , 33 ) = 4 . 48 , p < . 05 , η p2 = . 12 . Speci ﬁ cally , for the higher - shifting individuals , they produced ideas with higher originality in Epoch 2 ( M = 2 . 19 , SD = . 19 ) than in Epoch 1 ( M = 1 . 92 , SD = . 28 ) , t ( 16 ) = 6 . 9 , p < . 001 , Cohen ' s d = 1 . 13 . For the lower - shifting individuals , there was no di ﬀ erence of ideas ’ originality between Epoch 1 ( M = 1 . 95 , SD = . 19 ) and Epoch 2 ( M = 2 . 07 , SD = . 25 ) , t ( 17 ) = 2 . 08 , p = . 053 . Similarly , three separate repeated measures ANOVAs were con - ducted on the ﬂ uency scores . The results revealed the main e ﬀ ects of TIME ( i . e . , the ﬁ rst 1 . 5 min vs . the second 1 . 5 min ) in all three ANOVAs . That is , participants , no matter with higher or lower executive functions , produced more ideas in the ﬁ rst 1 . 5 min than in the second 1 . 5 min . No signi ﬁ cant interaction between TIME and any of three executive functions was found . 3 . 3 . EEG activity during Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on the ERD / ERS values in the theta ( 4 – 8 Hz ) , lower alpha ( 8 – 10 Hz ) , upper alpha ( 10 – 13 Hz ) , lower beta ( 13 – 20 Hz ) and upper beta ( 20 – 30 Hz ) frequency bands separately , with EPOCH , POSI ( FP 3 , 4 , F 3 , 4 , F 7 , 8 , FC 1 , 2 , FC 5 , 6 , C 3 , 4 , P 3 , 4 , P 7 , 8 , T 7 , 8 , O 1 , 2 ) and HEMI ( left vs . right ) as within - subject variables . The results were summarized in Table 1 . For the lower alpha , upper alpha and lower beta bands , there were signi ﬁ cant main e ﬀ ects of POSI . For the lower beta band , the results revealed a signi ﬁ cant interaction of HEMI×EPOCH on the ERD / ERS values , F ( 1 , 23 ) = 9 . 09 , p < . 01 , η p 2 = . 28 . Speci ﬁ cally , right hemisphere showed stronger lower beta activity than left hemisphere during Epoch 2 , while there was no di ﬀ erence of lower beta activity between hemi - spheres during Epoch 1 ( see Fig . 3 ) . 3 . 4 . E ﬀ ects of Epoch and executive functions on ERS / ERD values Mixed - design repeated measures ANOVAs with EPOCH , POSI , and HEMI as within - subject factors , and three executive functions ( i . e . , inhibition , shifting and updating ) as the grouping value for a between - subject factor , were conducted on the ERS / ERD values of theta , lower alpha , upper alpha , lower beta , and upper beta frequency bands , respectively . For the upper alpha band , there was a signi ﬁ cant interaction e ﬀ ect of POSI× HEMI × EPOCH × INHIBITION on the ERD / ERS values , F ( 9 , 198 ) = 2 . 30 , p < . 05 , η p2 = . 10 . For the higher - inhibition individuals , there was no e ﬀ ect of EPOCH on ERD / ERS values in both left and right hemisphere . But for the lower - inhibition individuals , there was a signi ﬁ cant interaction e ﬀ ect of POSI × EPOCH , F ( 9 , 99 ) = 2 . 17 , p < . 05 , η p2 = . 17 . Speci ﬁ cally , upper alpha activity in left hemisphere showed stronger in frontal areas ( PF 1 , F 3 , F 7 ) during Epoch 1 than Epoch 2 ( post hoc Tukey HSD test , ps < . 05 ) , but such a di ﬀ erent was not observed in right hemisphere ( see Fig . 4 ) . For the theta , lower alpha , lower beta and upper beta bands , there were no e ﬀ ects of three executive functions on the ERS / ERD values . 4 . Discussion In the present study , we aimed to test whether executive processes ( i . e . , updating , shifting and inhibition ) speci ﬁ cally contribute to the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT . We asked participants to generate and orally report ideas for the AUT problems , while the EEG activity was recorded . The behavioral results found that participants produced fewer ideas in the second 1 . 5 min than in the ﬁ rst 1 . 5 min , and the originality of ideas was higher in the ending positions ( i . e . , Epoch 2 ) than in the beginning positions ( i . e . , Epoch 1 ) ( see Fig . 1 ) . These ﬁ ndings indicated that the ﬂ uency of ideas decreased but the originality of ideas increased with time passing , which con ﬁ rmed the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT . The behavioral results showed that the originality of ideas in Epoch 2 was higher than in Epoch 1 for the higher - shifting individuals , but showed no di ﬀ erence between the two epochs for the lower - shifting individuals . That is , individuals with higher shifting levels exhibited the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT , while those with lower shifting levels did not . These ﬁ ndings provided evidences to support the role of executive Fig . 2 .

Shifting function repre - sents individuals ' cognitive ﬂ exibility ( Diamond , 2013 ) . Creativity requires ﬂ exibility of thought ( Chi , 1997 ) . The dual pathway to creativity model ( De Dreu et al . , 2008 ; Nijstad et al . , 2010 ) proposes ﬂ exibility be an important pathway to creative performance , in which individuals break mental sets , reorganize cognitive structures , and generate various cognitive categories . In this sense , the higher - shifting individuals might be good at switching to new idea categories when necessary during the course of DT , thus their later responses were better than their earlier responses . Notably , our results revealed that higher - vs . lower - inhibition individuals , or higher - vs . lower - updating individuals , showed no di ﬀ erence in the serial order e ﬀ ect during DT . Such results did not refute the possibility that inhibition or updating contributed to the serial order e ﬀ ect . Perhaps , the lower - inhibition or lower - updating individuals could invest a larger amount of cognitive resources to inhibit obvious ideas or maintain the controlled search from memory during DT , thus they exhibited the serial order e ﬀ ects similar as those of the higher - inhibition or higher - updating individuals . Or , a relatively small sample of participants in this study was not enough to reveal the di ﬀ erences between higher and lower - inhibition or between higher and lower - updating individuals . In brief , it should be cautious when interpreting the null results , further research is neces - sary . The EEG results revealed that upper alpha activity of the higher - and lower - inhibition individuals exhibited di ﬀ erent change patterns from Epoch 1 to Epoch 2 . For the higher - inhibition individuals , upper alpha activity showed no change from Epoch 1 to Epoch 2 . For the lower - inhibition individuals , upper alpha activity was strong in left frontal areas in Epoch 1 , but it decreased in Epoch 2 ( see Fig . 4 ) . It has been shown that alpha synchronization appears to re ﬂ ect a form of top - down activity ( Payne and Sekuler , 2014 ; von Stein and Sarnthein , 2000 ) , such as the inhibition for the interfering memories ( Hanslmayr et al . , 2011 ; Jensen and Mazaheri , 2010 ; Klimesch et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , the observed strong alpha synchronization in Epoch 1 for the lower - inhibition individuals could plausibly re ﬂ ect that they invested a large amount of cognitive resources to suppress interference from obvious or common ideas during the beginning epoch of DT . As time passed by , they got used to such a top - down activity and fewer common ideas were available to be suppressed , thus less cognitive resources were invested in inhibition , which was re ﬂ ected in the decrease of upper alpha activity in Epoch 2 . In a similar vein , we suggested that the higher - inhibition individuals might have higher Table 1 The ANOVA results of ERD / ERS values of theta ( 4 – 8 Hz ) , lower alpha ( 8 – 10 Hz ) , upper alpha ( 10 – 13 Hz ) , lower beta ( 13 – 20 Hz ) , and upper beta ( 20 – 30 Hz ) bands .

Neuropsychologia 99 ( 2017 ) 92 – 100 97 e ﬃ ciency to suppress the interfering information , thus they invested small quantity of cognitive resource to inhibit obvious ideas during the beginning epoch of DT . This was also the case during the ending epoch of DT . Thus , the higher - inhibition individuals exhibited similar upper alpha activity in both epochs . Overall , the EEG ﬁ ndings indicated that executive inhibition could contribute to the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT , as suggested in the previous study ( Beaty and Silvia , 2012 ) . Brie ﬂ y , the higher - inhibition individuals invest less cognitive resources in inhibi - tion , whereas lower - inhibition ones invest more . And , when they overcome interference from obvious or common ideas , more original ideas appear as time passes by . Recent fMRI studies demonstrated that coupling of the default network and control network bene ﬁ ted creative performance especially in the later stage of DT , probably because the control network would be often required to evaluate and modify candidate ideas in this stage ( see Beaty et al . , 2016 ; Zabelina and Andrews - Hanna , 2016 ) . In the present study , we found strong EEG upper alpha activity in early stage of DT for the lower - inhibition individuals ( see Fig . 4 ) . This ﬁ nding indicated that top - down suppression of predominant responses via functional interactions of the control network ( inhibition ) with the default network ( memory retrieval ) could occur at the early stage of DT . Recall here that we instructed participants to “ try their best to produce ideas that would be thought of by no one else ” , which emphasized the originality of ideas . Participants had to inhibit common but predomi - nant ideas , evaluate candidate ideas , and report high original ideas from the beginning of DT . In this sense , the patterns of inhibition being engaged in DT might be in ﬂ uenced by task demand . Another interesting ﬁ nding was that lower beta activity showed di ﬀ erent patterns during Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 ( see Fig . 3 ) . Lower beta activity was stronger in the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere in Epoch 2 , while there was no such di ﬀ erence in Epoch 1 . Previous studies revealed that the right hemisphere ( RH ) contributes to language comprehension and semantic coding ( Beeman et al . , 1994 ) . Engagement of RH in verbal DT could facilitate originality by activating large semantic ﬁ elds ( including concepts distantly related to the input word ) ( Beeman , 1993 ) , and promoting access to alternate or weak associations ( Grabner et al . , 2007 ; Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; O ’ Rourke et al . , 2015 ) . As for EEG beta activity , it was usually found to be associated with motor control ( Pfurtscheller et al . , 1996 ) . Recently , van Elk and his colleague ( van Elk et al . , 2008 ) proposed that the function role of motor activation ( e . g . beta band activity ) could be to support lexical - semantic retrieval . So , the observed stronger beta activity in the right hemisphere during Epoch 2 may re ﬂ ect that the brain was conducting coarse semantic processes that bene ﬁ ted the generation of original ideas . In this sense , this ﬁ nding indicated that associative processes contributed to the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT as well . However , given that few empirical studies demonstrated the association between EEG beta activity and semantic processes , the explanation above was an inference , and further research is necessary . There are three limitations of this study . First , to ensure numerical equivalence and temporal variation of the selected ideas , the ﬁ rst two ideas and last two ideas were grouped together respectively and represented the earlier and later epochs . Consequently , it is impossible to draw a whole picture to describe the change of ideas ' originality and EEG frequency oscillation during the course of DT . Further study could ask participants to solve a DT problem in several sessions ( e . g . , 4 sessions , 16 s for mental thought and 10 s for oral response in each session ) . Such a design can create “ orders ” with the distinctive positions and the ﬁ xed time periods . Second , the behavioral results revealed higher - and lower - shifting individuals exhibited di ﬀ erent serial order e ﬀ ect in DT ; however such di ﬀ erences were not re ﬂ ected in EEG activity . Perhaps task - related EEG synchronization is not sensitive to executive shifting . Further study should develop methods or techniques that can sensitively detect executive shifting in DT . Third , the present study focused on three core EFs ( i . e . , updating , shifting and inhibition ) instead of the higher - order EF ( i . e . , ﬂ uid intelligence ) . In fact , ﬂ uid intelligence in ﬂ uences the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT ( Beaty and Silvia , 2012 ) . EEG alpha activity is sensitive to the roles of ﬂ uid intelligence in the problem solving process evolving in open problem space ( Jaarsveld et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , future study about EEG correlates underlying the e ﬀ ects of ﬂ uid intelligence on the serial order e ﬀ ect in DT will be interesting .
