Volume 25 March 1 , 2014 679 MBoC | ARTICLE Role of turgor pressure in endocytosis in fission yeast Roshni Basu * , Emilia Laura Munteanu , and Fred Chang Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , NY 10032 ABSTRACT Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment . This turgor pressure , however , may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis . Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time - lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites . Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingres - sion of the endocytic pit in wild - type cells . Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrun - culin A . Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall , suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process . These studies suggest that endocytosis is gov - erned by a mechanical balance between local actin - dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane . INTRODUCTION Endocytosis involves the formation of a local invagination of the plasma membrane that resolves into an endocytic vesicle . In both fission and budding yeast cells , proteins have been found to as - semble and disassemble at the endocytic site in a highly choreo - graphed , dynamic sequence of events that take ∼ 100 s ( Merrifield et al . , 2004 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 , 2010 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Gal - letta and Cooper , 2009 ; Berro et al . , 2010 ; Basu and Chang , 2011 ; Boettner et al . , 2012 ; Weinberg and Drubin , 2012 ) . Initially , early proteins such as clathrin and early coat proteins arrive at the mem - brane , followed by cargo molecules and then intermediate and the late coat proteins . About 30 s after the arrival of the adaptor pro - teins , a local burst of Arp2 / 3 complex – dependent actin polymeriza - tion occurs at the site . This is followed by the rapid ingression of the membrane to form a narrow endocytic pit . Membrane scission at the neck of the pit then liberates the endocytic vesicle . Proteins that contribute to membrane curvature , such as BAR - domain proteins and dynamin , as well as local changes in phosphoinositide composi - tion , contribute to dynamic reorganization of the plasma membrane . In budding and fission yeast , actin is critical for multiple steps in this process , including invagination , membrane scission , and recruit - ment of other endocytic proteins ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ; Ayscough , 2000 ; Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ; Merrifield et al . , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ; Girao et al . , 2008 ; Galletta and Cooper , 2009 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Berro et al . , 2010 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Basu and Chang , 2011 ; Weinberg and Drubin , 2012 ) . A similar sequence of events occurs in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in animal cells ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , although the requirement for actin is less clear . Actin is generally believed to be dispensable for invagination but is needed in subsequent steps , such as scission and movement of the endocytic vesicle in the cyto - plasm ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 , 2005 ) . However , it has been shown to be important for membrane invagination in certain circumstances , such as at the apical surface of epithelial cells ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) and in the absence of dynamin ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) . One key difference between animal cells and walled cells such as those in yeast , plants , and bacteria is the presence of high turgor Monitoring Editor David G .

Molecular Biology of the Cell pathways by inducing the synthesis of intracellular glycerol ( Aiba et al . , 1995 ; Degols et al . , 1996 ; Hohmann , 2002 ) . This adaptive pro - cess , however , takes 15 – 60 min . We therefore used two ways to minimize these compensatory effects . First , we added sorbitol to wild - type cells and assayed effects within 1 – 5 min , before cells fully adapt . This treatment did not in - hibit endocytosis , as all patches internalized ( Figure 1C and Supple - mental Movie S2 ) . Sorbitol caused a significant dose - dependent shortening of the time period in which sla1 - GFP resides at the corti - cal site before crn1 - Tomato arrival ( Figure 1D , green , and Supple - mental Figure S1A ) . At 0 . 2 M sorbitol , this period was shortened by 43 % ( 11 . 1 ± 2 . 7 s , n = 20 patches ) . The period of crn1p on the cell surface was also slightly shortened ( Figure 1D , yellow ) , but these differences were not statistically significant . Similar findings were seen with patches marked with app1 - GFP and fim1 - GFP ( Supple - mental Figure S1 ) . Sorbitol caused significant decrease in the time spent by app1p and fim1p ( shortened by 34 and 30 % at 0 . 2 M sorbi - tol , respectively ; Supplemental Figure S1 ) . Sorbitol did not affect significantly the behavior of these markers after patch internalization ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) . Thus these data suggest that reduction in relative turgor pressure may cause acceleration of the early period of endocytosis . Second , we examined the effect of sorbitol in a mutant lacking gpd1p ( glycerol - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ) , the enzyme princi - pally responsible for increasing glycerol production upon osmotic stress . The gpd1 - null mutant cells have strong defects in adapting to changes in turgor pressure , and thus effects of sorbitol can be assayed in a more direct manner ( Aiba et al . , 1995 ; Degols et al . , 1996 ; Hohmann , 2002 ; Minc et al . , 2009 ) . A low dose ( 0 . 05 M ) of sorbitol to gpd1 ∆ cells led to 21 % decrease in the period of sla1p at the cortex as compared with the period in gpd1 ∆ cells without sor - bitol ( 5 . 2 vs . to 6 . 7 s ; n = 20 patches each ; Figure 1D ) . Note that in gpd1 ∆ cells even without sorbitol addition , the sla1p period was shorter compared with wild - type cells ; the reasons are not clear , as these cells may not have significantly reduced turgor pressure ( E . Atilgan and F . Chang , unpublished observations ) . We tested whether the increase in patch dynamics by sorbitol may be due to changes in the concentration of patch proteins such as actin . Fluorescence intensity measurements of the actin markers fim1p and app1p were not significantly affected by 0 . 025 M sorbitol treatment ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) . These data show that reducing turgor pressure can accelerate early stages of endocytosis before patch internalization in a dra - matic manner , by up to 40 % . Effect of sorbitol on the rate of membrane ingression Next we investigated whether sorbitol has an effect on the rate of patch movement during internalization . We tracked the movement of individual patches over time through subpixel - resolution tracking of sla1 - GFP patches . Immuno – electron microscopy showed that budding yeast Sla1 ( orthologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe sla1p ) is present at the base of the endocytic pit in budding yeast ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 , 2012 ) . If we assume that this cluster of S . pombe sla1 - GFP molecules marks the base of the pit as a point source , we could track the base of the pit with subpixel resolution ( see Materials and Methods ) . Using this approach , we found that sla1 - GFP patches were initially stationary on the cell cortex and then moved ∼ 300 nm into the cell interior in a biphasic pattern : a first phase of average velocity of 0 . 033 μm / s , and second phase with a faster final rate of 0 . 067 μm / s ( Figure 1 , E and F ; n = 20 patches ) . Patches subsequently paused and then often changed directions ; this may correspond to vesicle scission ( Figure 1E ) . Our ingression rate measurements are in pressure in the walled cells . Measurements of the mechanical prop - erties have shown that fission yeast cells have high turgor pressures , on the order of 1 – 1 . 5 MPa ( 1 MPa = 10 atm or 145 psi , similar to pressure in a racing bike tire ; Minc et al . , 2009 ; our unpublished observations ) . Similar turgor pressures have been estimated in bud - ding yeast ( Schaber et al . , 2010 ) . To support this internal pressure , the fission yeast cell is encased in an elastic cell wall with a Young’s modulus of ∼ 20 N / m ( elasticity similar to a hard tire rubber ; Minc et al . , 2009 ) . These measurements predict that indenting the plasma membrane into the cell interior may require substantial inward forces against this large outward force from turgor pressure . Recent work shows that turgor pressure may oppose the ingression of the plasma membrane during cleavage for cytokinesis in fission yeast ; addition of sorbitol , which reduces effective turgor pressure , causes ingres - sion of the septum to proceed faster ( Proctor et al . , 2012 ) . Aghamo - hammadzadeh and Ayscough ( 2009 ) showed initial results suggest - ing that turgor pressure is also a factor in endocytosis in budding yeast . Here we pursue a quantitative analysis of the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in fission yeast . Our results show that low - ering effective turgor pressure can make an early step in endocyto - sis proceed up to 40 % faster and ameliorate endocytic defects in cells with reduced actin dynamics . Thus these findings demonstrate that turgor pressure is a significant factor in endocytosis . On the as - sumption that elements of the patch need to work against 1 MPa pressure , these results provide initial estimates that hundreds of pi - conewtons of force is needed for membrane invagination in yeast endocytosis . RESULTS Reducing turgor pressure accelerates early endocytic events To monitor endocytic events in living cells , we imaged two represen - tative endocytic proteins , sla1p and coronin crn1p ( Supplemental Movie S1 ; Basu and Chang , 2011 ) . Sla1p , an adaptor protein , arrives early in the endocytic process , before the burst of actin polymeriza - tion , whereas crn1p , whose localization is actin dependent , arrives concurrent with actin polymerization . In time - lapse imaging of cells coexpressing sla1 - GFP and crn1 - Tomato , we observed that sla1p patches appeared on the cortex at the site of endocytosis and were stationary for an average of 19 . 6 ± 5 . 1 s ( n = 20 patches ) before mov - ing inward into the cell interior . At 17 . 4 ± 5 . 4 s after sla1p arrival , crn1p appeared at the site for 2 . 2 ± 2 . 5 s before moving inward with sla1p ( Figure 1 ) . This inward movement of the markers likely repre - sents the movement of the base of the endocytic pit into the cell interior ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 , 2012 ) . We term this detectable inward movement “ingression . ” Subsequently , sla1p and crn1p disassoci - ated from the patch structure after 14 . 5 ± 4 . 8 and 19 . 8 ± 8 . 2 s , re - spectively ( Supplemental Figure S1 ; Pelham and Chang , 2001 ; Sirot - kin et al . , 2010 ) . We also imaged the actin - binding proteins app1 – green fluorescent protein ( GFP ; Abp1 orthologue ) and fim1 - GFP ( fimbrin ) as markers for actin filaments at the endocytic site ( Supplemental Figure S1 ; Morrell et al . , 1999 ; Pelham and Chang , 2001 ) . Time - lapse imaging of these various markers thus provides a way to probe the dynamic progression of events at the endocytic site . We hypothesized that high internal turgor pressure opposes the inward movement of the plasma membrane during endocytosis . To test this , we examined the effects of reducing turgor pressure on endocytosis by adding different concentrations of sorbitol to the media . High concentrations of sorbitol ( > 0 . 4 M , which is equivalent to 1 MPa ) cause cells to shrink , and so we used much lower sorbitol concentrations . Cells respond to sorbitol through osmotic shock Volume 25 March 1 , 2014 Turgor pressure and endocytosis | 681 effect on inward rate or depth of movement in wild - type S . pombe cells ( n = 19 cells ) . Sorbitol also had little effect on rates and depths of ingression in gpd1 ∆ cells ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Thus , al - though sorbitol affects the initial stages of endocytosis , it does not affect the actual ingression process . the range of previous estimates in fission yeast of 0 . 06 – 0 . 1 μm / s ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ) . Our depth measurements in live cells are larger than the dimensions of the budding yeast endocytic pit measured by electron microscopy ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 ; Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . Of interest , addition of 0 . 2 M sorbitol had little FIGURE 1 : Addition of sorbitol to the media accelerates initial events of endocytosis .

Basu et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1 – 5 min . At 0 . 2 M sorbitol , ∼ 90 % of patches moved inward ( n = 56 patches ) . However , sla1 - GFP patches traveled inward for only about one - sixth of the normal distance ( ∼ 50 nm ) , and the rate of move - ment was ∼ 10 - fold slower than the initial movement in wild - type cells ( 0 . 003 μm / s ; n = 15 patches ; Figure 1F ) . In addition , instead of fully internalizing , most patches then appeared to spring back to the cortex ( Figure 2 ) . This kind of “bounce - back” behavior is similar to that of mutants defective in scission , such as F - BAR protein mutants ( e . g . , bzz1 ) and mutants in actin regulation ( e . g . wsp1 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ; Basu and Chang , 2011 ; Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . Thus sorbitol addition may allow endocytic pits with a compromised actin cytoskeleton to move partially inward but not to fully undergo scission . Reducing turgor pressure partially suppresses the requirement for actin polymerization during endocytosis We next asked whether reducing effective turgor pressure rescues cells that are defective in endocytosis . First , we tested whether sor - bitol suppresses the endocytic defects seen in cells treated with 2 μM latrunculin A ( LatA ) , an inhibitor of actin polymerization . At this low dose of latrunculin A , actin filaments are still present at patches , but the patches do not move inward detectably ( 98 % of patches ; n = 53 patches ; Figure 2 ; Basu and Chang , 2011 ) . These patches may not be able to ingress because they lack a burst of actin polym - erization that usually precedes ingression ( Basu and Chang , 2011 ) . The addition of sorbitol rescued the ingression defect in these LatA - treated cells . We examined the effects of adding sorbitol within FIGURE 2 : Sorbitol rescues endocytic ingression defects of cells treated with a low dose of latrunculin A .

Cell wall synthesis has been proposed to facilitate membrane invaginations in bacteria ( Meyer et al . , 2010 ) . In fungal cytokinesis , cell wall assembly at the septum is believed to provide most of the force for ingression of plasma membrane against turgor pressure ( Proctor et al . , 2012 ) . We tested whether the cell wall similarly contributes force for endocytic ingression or somehow shields or stabilizes the plasma membrane from turgor pressure . To test the role of the cell wall , we removed the cell wall by enzy - matic digestion to generate protoplasts . These were maintained in media with 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 M sorbitol for osmotic support to prevent cell lysis . Because of the long incubation periods in sorbitol , these cells adapt their internal turgor pressures to the extracellular sorbitol con - centration . Protoplasts formed endocytic patches , although they were no longer in a polarized distribution ( Figure 4A ) . Time - lapse imaging revealed that these patches were still dynamic . Measure - ments showed no significant change in cortical residence times of patches : sla1 - GFP and crn1 - Tomato remained at the cortex for 13 . 0 ± 3 . 8 and 2 . 7 ± 0 . 7 s , respectively , in the presence of a cell wall and for 11 . 7 ± 2 . 9 and 2 . 9 ± 1 . 6 s , respectively , in protoplasts ( n = 10 ; Figure 4B ) . Depth of ingression was similar to that in intact cells , al - though rate of membrane ingression in the protoplasts was about twofold slower ( Figure 4C ) . These results are consistent with a previ - ous finding in which endocytic uptake of pheromone continues in budding yeast spheroplasts ( deHart et al . , 2003 ) . Thus the cell wall is not required for efficient endocytosis in these cells . DISCUSSION These studies indicate that turgor pressure is a factor in the mechan - ics of endocytosis in fission yeast . We show that reducing the effec - tive turgor pressure accelerates progression of early endocytic events in wild - type cells and compensates for defects in endocytic mutants affected in actin assembly , cross - linking , and myosin I . De - creasing turgor pressure has effects on multiple aspects of endocy - tosis : it dramatically increases the rate of progression of initial events leading up to actin polymerization and ingression and also compen - sates for subsequent actin - dependent defects in ingression and scission . We postulate that turgor pressure introduces outward ten - sion on the plasma membrane ; addition of sorbitol may allow the membrane to be more amenable to inward deformations needed for endocytosis to progress . Precisely how sorbitol affects membrane deformations is unclear . The mechanism and timing of initial indentation of the plasma mem - brane in wild - type cells are not well established . A cryo – electron to - mography study in budding yeast showed that the plasma membrane is flat before the arrival of F - actin and that indentation of the plasma membrane is actin dependent ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast , im - muno – electron microscopy studies in budding yeast using chemical fixation show that indentation of the membrane occurs early and is independent of actin and clathrin ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 , 2012 ) . It remains to be seen when membrane deformations occur in fission yeast and how sorbitol alters membrane topology . In our light microscopy – based assays , small initial deformations would not be detectable . These studies begin to provide quantitative estimates for force production needed for membrane ingression for endocytosis . If we assume a turgor pressure of 1 MPa ( Minc et al . , 2009 ) and the tip of the invagination to be a hemispherical structure , a simple calcula - tion ( force = pressure × surface area ) leads to a plot of force required for invaginations of different sizes ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) . It is not clear , however , what size of the pit is relevant . The size of the invagination varies as the pit evolves over time : initial indentations in budding yeast have a radius of > 30 nm , whereas a more mature Sorbitol , however , could not compensate for total loss of actin . In cells treated with a high dose of LatA ( 200 μM for 10 min ) , which causes depolymerization of all detectable actin filaments ( Chang , 1999 ; Pelham and Chang , 2001 ) , sla1 - GFP – marked patches ap - peared and persisted on the cell surface for the entire length of the movie ( 50 s ) without detectable movement ( n = 100 patches ; Sup - plemental Figure S3 ) . Addition of 0 . 1 – 0 . 4 M sorbitol did not sup - press this defect . Thus a minimal amount of F - actin is required for patch ingression in sorbitol . Reducing turgor pressure rescues endocytic mutants We tested whether reducing turgor pressure could rescue defects in representative endocytic mutants . Wsp1p ( WASp ) and myo1p ( myo - sin I ) are activators of Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated actin assembly and are necessary for efficient endocytosis ( Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Basu and Chang , 2011 ) . Myosin I is the primary myosin present at endo - cytic sites and thus may contribute to actin - based force production for endocytosis . In wsp1 - and myo1 - null mutants , patches form with some F - actin but fail in ingression ( Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ; Basu and Chang , 2011 ) . We found that 85 % of wsp1 ∆ patches remained stationary at the cell cortex . Addition of 0 . 1 M sorbitol led to ingression of 90 % of patches and to full internaliza - tion of 55 % of patches ( Figure 3A ) . Similarly , 80 % of myo1 ∆ patches remained stationary at the cell cortex in the absence of sorbitol , and 82 % of patches ingressed in 0 . 1 M sorbitol , with 70 % of patches exhibiting full internalization ( Figure 3B ) . For reasons that are un - clear , addition of a higher dose to 0 . 2 M sorbitol rescued more poorly than 0 . 1 M in both wsp1 ∆ and myo1 ∆ mutants . We also examined an arp2 mutant ( component of the Arp2 / 3 complex ) . In this partial loss - of - function mutant arp2 - 1 ( Morrell et al . , 1999 ) all patches ingressed but only after long delays at the cell surface ( sla1p resident time , 31 . 3 ± 7 . 6 s ; n = 20 patches ; Figure 3C ) . Addition of sorbitol significantly rescued this delay ( 18 . 7 ± 5 . 4 s at 0 . 025 M sorbitol ; 41 % less than at 0 M sorbitol ) . In addition to actin assembly , bundling of actin filaments is also likely to be critical for force production . The actin - bundling protein fimbrin is a patch protein required for efficient endocytosis ( Wu et al . , 2001 ; Gheorghe et al . , 2008 ; Skau and Kovar , 2010 ) . We found that in fim1 ( fimbrin ) mutant cells , only 10 % of patches fully internal - ized , whereas in 0 . 2 M sorbitol , 87 % did ( n = 40 and 62 patches re - spectively ; Figure 3D ) . Sorbitol , however , did not rescue all endocytic mutants . In the end4 mutant ( Sla2 , Hip1 - related adaptor protein ) , patches form ab - normal actin comet tail structures ( Wu et al . , 2001 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ) . Fifty - four percent of patches in this mutant did not ingress . Sorbitol did not rescue this defect ( 46 % in 0 . 05 M sorbitol ; n > 70 patches ) and inhibited ingression entirely at 0 . 1 M ( Figure 3E ) . In these mutant cells , the actin cytoskeleton is believed to be uncou - pled from the plasma membrane ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) and may therefore have defects that cannot be rescued by reduction in tur - gor pressure . Inhibitory effects of higher doses of sorbitol ( e . g . , 0 . 2 M ) , which were seen in wsp1 ∆ , myo1 ∆ , end4 ∆ , and gpd1 ∆ mu - tants ( Figures 1 and 3 ) , may be caused by adverse effects of sorbitol on global cell physiology in addition to local effects at endocytic pits . Nevertheless , the impressive rescue of WASp , myosin I , and fimbrin mutants , as well as LatA - treated cells , supports the idea that a primary function of actin and these factors is to provide mechani - cal forces opposing turgor pressure . The cell wall is not required for endocytosis Endocytosis and the cell wall share a close relationship in fungal and plant cells . For instance , regions of endocytosis correlate with 684 | R . Basu et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell compensatory mechanisms need to be invoked . Fluorescence in - tensity measurements suggest that each patch contains > 100 of Arp2 / 3 complexes and capping proteins , which suggested that there are ∼ 140 actin barbed ends in the patch ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ) . However simulations accounting for ac - tin polymerization rates suggest that there may be only ∼ 8 growing actin barbed ends ( Berro et al . , 2010 ) . If each actin filament exerts 2 pN pushing force ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) , 10 filaments would pit may have a radius of ∼ 12 nm ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . Moreover , sizes may be different in fission versus budding yeast . If we assume that a mature endocytic pit has an outer radius of 12 nm , then the estimated force from turgor pressure in this case is ∼ 900 pN . The forces needed for the initial shallow indentation ( with > 30 nm radius ) may be much larger . We considered whether actin and myosin provide sufficient force for ingression of the endocytic pit or other force - producing or FIGURE 3 : Sorbitol rescues a subset of endocytic mutants .

These studies used much higher con - centrations of sorbitol and incubation times in sorbitol of 10 min to 4 h ; thus many of their findings are in cells that have adapted to high concentrations to sorbitol . Their most striking result was that sorbitol suppressed the complete loss of F - actin caused by high doses of LatA , using the internalization of the dye Lucifer yellow as an assay . We show , using movement of patch markers as an assay , that sorbitol treatment does not rescue cells treated with this high dose of LatA . Moreover , we find that even in the absence of sorbi - tol , S . pombe cells treated with high doses of LatA can still uptake Lucifer yellow into vacuoles , even though they are blocked for uptake of another membrane dye , FM4 - 64 ( Supplemental Figure S3D , E ) . Thus it is likely that , at least in fission yeast , the uptake of Lucifer yellow proceeds through a distinct actin - inde - pendent mechanism . Our findings in fission yeast are relevant to endocytosis in animal cells . Actin is critical for endocytosis at least under certain condi - tions . Especially because inhibitory drugs may not completely in - hibit F - actin ( Collins et al . , 2011 ) , the role of actin in mammalian endocytosis may be in fact underappreciated . In endothelial cells , actin dynamics is required for endocytosis at the apical but not the basolateral surface ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Mechanical stretching at the basolateral surface makes endocytosis also actin dependent , in effect , more “yeast like . ” At the apical surface , another myosin type I is implicated in increasing membrane tension ( Nambiar et al . , 2009 ) . In yeast , turgor pressure could provide a similar effect to pro - vide tension on the membrane . Thus these actin - dependent mech - anisms studied in yeast are likely to be used in animal cells . provide only a very small portion ( < 5 % ) of the force needed . Myosin I , an actin motor that also binds directly to the plasma membrane , is a good candidate for producing actin - dependent forces on mem - branes . Three hundred myo1p ( myosin I ) molecules in each patch ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ) , each exerting 2 pN force ( Molloy et al . , 1995 ; Veigel et al . , 2003 ) , would generate maximally ∼ 600 pN . Thus myo - sin I – based forces could supply the right order of magnitude of force required for invagination of a pit with a 10 nm radius but per - haps not enough for one with a 12 nm radius . More - sophisticated models for endocytosis membrane mechanics may be developed after more parameters are measured . Models incorporating the elastic nature of branched actin gels , for instance , the “elastic pro - pulsion” model , may be considered ( Mogilner and Rubinstein , 2005 ) . Additional candidate force - producing elements at the patch may also contribute , including membrane - curving proteins such as the clathrin coat , BAR domain – containing proteins , dynamin , mem - brane composition , and line tension ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . These large forces needed to counter turgor pressure of 1000 nN / μm 2 are three orders of magnitude higher than actin - based forces measured in animal cells : actin comet tails formed by Listeria produce forces on the order of 1 . 5 nN / μm 2 ( Giardini et al . , 2003 ) and at focal adhesions in fibroblasts and myocytes are on the order of 5 nN / μm 2 ( Balaban et al . , 2001 ) . In fission yeast cytokinesis , because the septum is 100 nm in width , actomyosin - based forces are not sufficient to pull the membrane for cleavage furrow ingression ; in - stead , it is proposed that assembly of the cell wall fibers provides a large pushing force inward ( Proctor et al . , 2012 ) . Because of the forces for endocytic ingression are so dependent on size , mechanics may be a major constraint on the size of the endocytic pit in cells with high turgor pressure .

Basu et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell analysis of patch movements in the cell , the series of patch positions in time was then used to evaluate the distance of the patch from the cell membrane cortex . The membrane location was set manually by drawing a tangent line to the cell cortex at the patch location in the initial frame of the time series . The distance between the patch and the membrane was calculated as the perpendicular distance from the point representing the patch position to the line . The shortest distance between the tangent and the patch position was defined as 0 μm . The tracks obtained are manually aligned , where a patch is defined to begin internalizing when four consecutive patch posi - tions show an increase in distance from the cortex . Protoplast preparation Cells were grown to OD 600 of 0 . 5 , washed with SCS buffer ( 20 mM citrate buffer , 1 M d - sorbitol , pH 5 . 8 ) , and resuspended in 0 . 05 g / ml Lallzyme ( Lallemand , Montreal , Canada ; Flor - Parra et al . , 2013 ) . Cells were incubated at 37°C with gentle shaking . After 10 min , when ∼ 90 % of the cell walls were removed , the protoplast were washed gently with SCS buffer and resuspended in YE5S with 0 . 25 M sorbitol . Lucifer yellow and FM4 - 64 endocytosis assays For Lucifer yellow assays , cells were grown in liquid YE5S culture with or without latrunculin A , spun down , and resuspended in YE5S ( 25 μl ) containing Lucifer yellow dye ( 10 μl of 40 mg / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ; made up in water and stored in the dark at 4°C ) with or without latrunculin A . Cells was incubated on a tabletop rotor for 30 min at room temperature . Cells were washed two times with 100 μl of potassium phosphate buffer ( 50 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM NaF , 10 mM NaN 3 ) and imaged immediately on a Zeiss scan - ning confocal microscope ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . For FM4 - 64 as - says , cells were grown in liquid YE5S culture with or without latrun - culin A for 10 min , stained with 20 mM FM4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) for 1 min at room temperature , washed with YE5S , and imaged after 10 min . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and media The S . pombe strains used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table S1 . Standard methods for S . pombe media and genetic ma - nipulations were used ( Moreno et al . , 1991 ) . Tagged and deletion strains were constructed using a PCR - based approach and con - firmed by analytical PCR ( Bahler et al . , 1998 ) . All yeast strains were grown to log phase in rich YE5S ( yeast extract and amino acids ) media at 25°C in exponential phase for imaging unless otherwise noted . For imaging , cells were mounted in liquid media with indi - cated additions on a glass slide overlaid with a glass coverslip and imaged immediately at room temperature ( 25 – 28°C ) . Sorbitol and latrunculin A treatment Cells were grown in mid exponential phase with shaking in liquid cultures in rich media YE5S at 25°C . They were treated with indicated concentrations of sorbitol ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) in YE5S and imaged within 1 – 5 min . For LatA treatments , cells were incubated in indicated concentrations of LatA for 2 – 5 min before image acquisi - tion . A 20 mM stock solution of latrunculin A ( Biomol International , Plymouth , PA ) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and was used at a range of concentrations ( 2 – 400 μM ) . For each set of experiments , the efficacy of the drug was confirmed by phalloidin staining of fixed samples ( Chang et al . , 1996 ) . Microscopy and image analysis Microscopy was performed using a spinning disk confocal micro - scope ( Pelham and Chang , 2001 ) with a Hamamatsu electron - multi - plying charge coupled device camera ( Hamamatsu , Hamamatsu , Japan ) with a 100 × / 1 . 4 numerical aperture oil objective and 1 . 5 × magnifier , or a Zeiss LSM 710 laser - scanning confocal microscope . Images were acquired , processed , and analyzed with the OpenLab 5 . 0 . 2 software ( Improvision , Coventry , United Kingdom ) , Microman - ager ( Edelstein et al . , 2010 ) , and ImageJ software ( National Insti - tutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . In general , cortical patches were imaged in time lapse in a single medial focal plane through the cell . Although we analyzed discrete patches that appeared to be in fo - cus , the use of the single focal plane may introduce minor variability in fluorescence intensity measurements . Subpixel - resolution tracking of patches was performed in Matlab ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . The patches marked by fluorescent pro - teins appear as near - resolution - sized round particles . An isotropic two - dimensional ( 2D ) Gaussian kernel of intensities is fitted to the fluorescence image of individual patches at each time frame . The fit parameters were the position of the 2D Gaussian center , the SD of the 2D Gaussian , which is taken isotropic in all directions , the base level of intensity , and the maximum intensity at the center of the 2D Gaussian . The size of the kernel was set equal to the size of a manu - ally cropped region containing the patch throughout the time se - ries . The position of the patch was given by the center of the fitted 2D Gaussian . An approximate start position was manually indicated in the first frame and used as the initial input value for the fitting procedure . We measured the precision of this tracking method by analyzing stationary beads and patches ( Supplemental Figure S5 ) . We followed bead position with a precision of 6 nm for binning 1 ( a field of view of 512 × 512 pixels ; 33 × 33 μm ) and 9 nm for binning 2 ( a field of view of 256 × 256 pixels ) , as calculated as the SD of positions from tracking 100 - nm fluorescent silica particles ( 0 . 1 - μm TetraSpeck Fluorescent Microspheres ; T7284 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) immobilized on a glass surface ( Supplemental Figure S5B ) . A similar precision of 6 nm ( binning 1 ) was found in stationary sla1 - GFP patches in LatA - treated living cells ( Supplemental Figure S5C ) .
