Different pathogens use TNT - like structures as “freeways” to propagate across cells . TNTs are also implicated in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases , making them promising therapeutic targets . Understanding the mechanism of their formation , and their relation with filopodia is of fundamental importance to uncover their physiological function , particularly since filopodia , differently from TNTs , are not able to mediate transfer of cargo between distant cells . Here we studied different regulatory complexes of actin , which play a role in the formation of both these structures . We demonstrate that the filopodia - promoting CDC42 / IRSp53 / VASP network negatively regulates TNT formation and impairs TNT - mediated intercellular vesicle transfer . Conversely , elevation of Eps8 , an actin regulatory protein that inhibits the extension of filopodia in neurons , increases TNT formation . Notably , Eps8 - mediated TNT induction requires Eps8 bundling but not its capping activity . Thus , despite their structural similarities , filopodia and TNTs form through distinct molecular mechanisms . Our results further suggest that a switch in the molecular composition in common actin regulatory complexes is critical in driving the formation of either type of membrane protrusion . Tunneling Nanotubes ( TNTs ) are cellular protrusions that represent a mechanism for direct , long - range intercel - lular communication 1 . They constitute a membranous and cytoplasmic continuity between remote cells supported by the actin cytoskeleton and in some cases microtubules 1 , 2 . TNTs are fragile and dynamic structures with a small diameter ( 20 – 500 nm ) and a length up to 100 μ m , which hover freely in the medium without touching the sub - strate in culture . They have been shown to mediate the cell - to - cell transfer of many different cellular components including : membrane proteins , soluble molecules , vesicles derived from various organelles , and mitochondria 3 . TNT - like structures have been observed in a wide variety of cell types in vitro 2 as well as in vivo models 4 – 7 . Even though the precise physiological function of TNTs remains enigmatic , their involvement in essential processes like signal transduction , apoptosis , development , and immune response has been postulated 2 , 8 . Various patho - gens , such as viruses 9 , 10 and bacteria 11 , can use TNT - like structures to travel from one cell to another . TNTs are also emerging as an important player in cancer development 5 , 6 , 12 , 13 . We have previously demonstrated that TNTs can mediate the intercellular transfer of infectious prions between neuronal cells , dendritic cells to neurons , and between astrocytes 14 – 17 . Interestingly , other “prion - like” amyloidogenic proteins like misfolded huntingtin 18 , amyloid β 19 , α - synuclein 20 , and tau 21 can also be transferred between distant cells through TNTs , thus under - scoring the important role of TNTs in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases , and their potential use as therapeutic targets 22 . Two mechanisms for TNT formation have been proposed 23 . The first one , which is commonly referred to as the “cell dislodgment mechanism” , describes two cells closely apposed to each other fusing transiently and 1 Unité Trafic Membranaire et Pathogenèse , Institut Pasteur , 25 – 28 Rue du Docteur Roux , 75724 Paris CEDEX 15 , France . 2 Ultrapole , Institut Pasteur , 25 - 28 Rue du Docteur Roux , 75724 Paris CEDEX 15 , France . 3 FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology , 20139 Milan , Italy . 4 Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute , Università degli Studi di Milano , 20122 Milan , Italy . * These authors contributed equally to this work .

An alternative mechanism , known as the actin driven protrusion mechanism , proposes an active process based on the extension of a filopodium - like protrusion from one cell to another , followed by membrane fusion of the tip upon physical contact 1 . In both cases , the application of actin depolymerizing drugs strongly reduces TNT formation , suggesting that actin plays a critical role 1 , 24 , 25 . However the molecular mechanism ( s ) underlying TNT formation is still ill defined . The role of endogenously and exogenously expressed M - Sec , a protein sharing homology with Sec6 , a component of the exocyst complex , as a positive regulator of TNT formation has been shown in multiple cell types 9 , 26 , 28 . M - Sec induction of TNT formation involves its interaction with the GTPase Ras - related A protein ( RalA ) and the exo - cyst complex 26 . Furthermore , the transmembrane major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class III protein leucocyte specific transcript 1 ( LST1 ) interacts with M - Sec and mediates the recruitment of RalA to the plasma membrane , promoting its interaction with the exocyst complex 27 . This multi - molecular complex can contribute to the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and to the delivery of membrane at the site of TNT formation . The protein p53 was recently found to play a crucial role in the formation of TNTs in astrocytes via the epidermal growth factor and the Akt / mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTor ) / phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) path - way 19 . However , cells that do not express M - Sec , such as the mouse neuronal CAD cell line and neurons , are still capable of forming TNTs 29 . Furthermore , p53 - independent TNT formation was observed in rat pheochromo - cytoma PC12 cells and in acute myeloid leukemia cells 29 , suggesting that different molecular mechanisms may be at play . Whether different formation mechanisms lead to intercellular connections having distinct functions remains to be determined 30 . Another important observation is that TNTs share structural similarities with filopodia , particularly in their small diameter and requirement of actin for the protrusion 31 . We have previously observed that the expression of two known filopodia inducers , the vasodilatator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) and fascin 32 , decreases the number of TNT - connected cells 30 while Myosin X , another filopodial inducer , stimulates the formation of TNTs and intercellular transfer of vesicles in CAD cells 33 . We further demonstrated that TNT induction requires the F2 lobe of Myosin X “band 4 . 1 , ezrin , radixin , moesin” ( FERM ) domain 30 , but not the F3 lobe ( both needed for filopodia adherence to the substrate 34 , 35 , suggesting that dorsal filopodia might be a TNT precursor . However , these findings and other data in the literature did not reveal whether TNTs and filopodia are identical or structur - ally related structures , and whether they share the same machinery for their formation . To address this issue we studied the role of a subset of different actin remodeling complexes in TNT formation previously shown to be involved in filopodial protrusion . Specifically , up - regulation of filopodia elongation was shown to depend on VASP recruitment and clustering by the Insulin Receptor Substrate of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) 36 . IRSp53 has been implicated in the formation of filopodia via its dual function : it can deform the plasma mem - brane through its “Inverted Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs” ( I - BAR ) domain , thus generating a membrane protrusion , and it interacts with several actin regulators via its “Src homology 3” ( SH3 ) domain 37 , 38 . IRSp53 is synergistically activated by the binding of effectors to its SH3 domain and by the binding of the RhoGTPase CDC42 to its “CDC42 and Rac interactive binding” ( CRIB ) domain 39 . Thus , we investigated the possible role of IRSp53 and CDC42 in the formation of TNTs and intercellular transfer of vesicles . We found that CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP act as negative regulators of TNT formation and vesicle transfer function . We further show that these proteins act in concert to inhibit TNT formation . We also demonstrated that epidermal growth factor receptor pathway 8 ( Eps8 ) , another actin regulator that has been shown to inhibit filopodia formation in neurons 38 , 40 , is a positive regulator of TNT formation and transfer . In addition , by expressing mutant forms of Eps8 which were impaired in either the capping or bundling activity of the protein , we showed that TNT induction requires Eps8 bundling but not capping activity . To our knowledge , this is the first molecular demonstration that TNTs and filopodia are different cellular structures that form through different mechanisms , paving the way to further study their physiological function ( s ) . Results CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP negatively regulate TNT formation . In order to understand the relation - ship between filopodia and TNTs , and to dissect the molecular players involved in TNT generation , we investi - gated the role of actin regulators known to be involved in filopodia formation . We first transfected neuronal CAD cells 18 , 20 , 30 with plasmids encoding fluorescently - tagged versions of these proteins and evaluated the ratio of TNT - connected cells in sub - confluent cultures by confocal microscopy . Around 65 % of the control cells transfected with an empty vector encoding a fluorescent tag were connected by TNTs . Interestingly , the ectopic expression of GFP - CDC42 V12 , a constitutively active form of CDC42 , reduced the number of TNT - connected cells by approximately 40 % , while GFP - CDC42 T17N , a dominant - negative form of the protein , significantly increased TNT formation ( Fig . 1a and b , Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . This suggests that , contrary to what has been reported in other cell lines 26 , 27 , 41 , CDC42 may negatively regulate TNT formation in neuronal CAD cells . A significant reduction of TNT - connected cells was also observed upon ectopic expression of RFP - IRSp53 while expression of RFP - IRS - FP / AA , an IRSp53 mutant impaired in its binding to downstream effectors through the SH3 domain , did not affect TNT formation ( Fig . 1a and b , Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . This result points to the potential role of IRSp53 in the negative regulation of TNTs via its interaction with protein partners . Consistently , ectopic expression of GFP - VASP , an interactor of IRSp53 , also leads to less cells connected via TNTs compared to the control ( Fig . 1a and b , Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) , a member of the ras - related superfamily of small GTPases has been shown to share the same signaling pathway with and be activated by CDC42 42 . To test if Rac1 has a similar effect on TNT formation as CDC42 in CADs , we tested Myc - Rac1 V12 , a constitutively active form of Rac1 , and Myc - Rac1 17 N , a dominant negative form of Rac1 . We evaluated any changes in TNT formation and discovered that the active form of Rac1 decreases the percentage of cells connected via TNTs while its dom - inant negative form increases TNT formation , similar to the effect of the active and negative forms of CDC42 , www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 39632 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep39632 respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Thus , the combined use of Rac1 and CDC42 mutants provide evidence that inducers of filopodia and lamellipodia have an opposite effect ( i . e . decrease ) on TNT formation . CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP negatively regulate intercellular vesicle transfer . To address the functional relevance of CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP action on TNT formation , we investigated their effects on TNT - mediated vesicle transfer . We used a well - established protocol that allows the evaluation of cell - contact dependent intercellular vesicle transfer 24 , 30 , 43 . This protocol is based on the co - culture of two cell populations with a 1 : 1 ratio : a “donor population” , whose internal vesicles are labeled with the non - specific membrane dye DiD , and an “acceptor population” , transfected with a different fluorescent marker ( H2B - mCherry or H2B - GFP ) . After Figure 1 . VASP , CDC42 , and IRSp53 negatively regulate the number of TNT - connected cells .

The cell - contact requirement of this transfer was assessed by using a filter to physically separate the two cell populations while allowing the transfer of exosomes and soluble molecules or by applying the conditioned medium from the donor cells onto the acceptor population for the same duration as the co - culture , as we previously showed 30 . After transfecting the donor population with GFP - CDC42 V12 , RFP - IRSp53 , and GFP - VASP , we observed a significant reduction in intercellular vesicle transfer ( 40 % , 15 % and 20 % on average , respectively ) ( Fig . 2a and b , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . On the other hand , we observed no sig - nificant difference in comparison to control group upon overexpression of GFP - CDC42 T17N or RFP - IRS FP / AA ( Fig . 2a and b , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . These effects on vesicle transfer paralleled those seen on the number of TNT - connected cells indicating that CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP act as negative regulators of both TNT formation and transfer function . CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP act as a network to inhibit TNT formation . Next , we investigated whether the mechanism by which CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP inhibit TNT formation involved them acting inde - pendently or in concert . We co - transfected cells with either CDC42 / IRSp53 , IRSp53 / VASP or CDC42 / VASP couples of different constructs described above , and evaluated the number of TNT - forming cells by immuno - fluorescence . Interestingly , co - transfection of the dominant negative form of CDC42 , ( GFP - CDC42 - T17N and Myc - CDC42 T17N ) , RFP - IRSp53 , or GFP - VASP reverted the decrease in TNT - connected cells observed upon transfection of either RFP - IRSp53 or GFP - VASP alone . Notably , this finding indicates that CDC42 activity is required for IRSp53 and VASP inhibition of TNT formation ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . On the other hand , the IRSp53 mutant ( RFP - IRS FP / AA ) reverted the decrease in TNT - connected cells induced by GFP - CDC42 V12 overexpression , suggesting that CDC42 negative regulation of TNT formation requires IRSp53 capacity to recruit its protein partners ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Fig . 4 ) .

A population of CAD cells was transiently transfected with the different fluorescently - tagged constructs ( donor population ) and another population was transiently transfected with either H2B - GFP or H2B - mCherry ( acceptor population ) .

Collectively , these results indicate that CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP act as a network which negatively regulates TNT formation . VASP positively regulates filopodia formation . Because the CDC42 / IRSp53 / VASP network was shown to act as a positive regulator in filopodia formation in neuronal cells 36 , 38 , 44 , we analyzed whether it plays a similar role in CAD cells . However , since CDC42 and IRSp53 can also reduce the formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia that can mask filopodia formation we focused on VASP . VASP was shown to act down - stream of IRSp53 for filopodia induction , but is not involved in IRSp53 - mediated lamellipodia formation 38 , 44 . The formation of filopodia was qualitatively assessed by both correlative - scanning electron microscopy ( CL - SEM ) ( Fig . 4a ) and super resolution structured illumination microscopy ( SR - SIM ) imaging ( Fig . 4b ) of transfected cells . In most cases , VASP transfected cells exhibited an increase in the number of actin - positive , filopodia - like dorsal protrusions with respect to GFP transfected control cells , suggesting that VASP also exerts a positive regulation of filopodia formation in CAD cells . Contrary to TNTs and dorsal filopodia , attached filopodia dis - play vinculin - positive focal adhesion at their tips 33 , 45 . We used this specificity to automatically detect and count vinculin - positive peripheral cellular protrusions , in order to obtain more quantitative data on the role of VASP in attached filopodia formation ( see methods ) 46 . We demonstrated an enrichment of peripheral focal adhesions in GFP - VASP transfected cells compared to the control , confirming the involvement of VASP in promoting filopodia formation in our cell line model ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Eps8 positively regulates TNT formation and function via its bundling activity . The results pre - sented above show that positive regulators of filopodia formation can inhibit TNT formation and function . This suggests that TNTs and filopodia might be distinct structures oppositely regulated by the same signaling path - ways . To further investigate this hypothesis , we decided to look at the role in TNT formation of Eps8 , another actin regulator shown to negatively regulate the formation of filopodia in neuronal cells 40 . First , the endogenous levels of Eps8 were analyzed in CAD cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . We found that CAD cells express very low amounts of Eps8 mRNA , compared to brain tissue and CHO cells , and the protein was not detectable , thus the role of this actin regulator was studied by its overexpression . Consistent with data present in the literature in other cell models , we observed a nearly complete disappearance of dorsal and peripheral filopodia like protrusions in CAD cells overexpressing GFP - Eps8 ( Fig . 4a and b ) . Indeed the CL - SEM ( Fig . 4a ) and SR - SIM ( Fig . 4b ) images showed tiny actin - positive protrusions , reminiscent to the club - like protrusions previously described in neurons overexpressing this construct 40 . Intriguingly , ectopic expression of GFP - Eps8 in CAD cells induced a significant increase in the number of TNT - connected cells ( Fig . 5a and b , Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . To dissect the mechanism of Eps8 action , we assessed the effect on TNT formation of its actin - capping and - bundling activity . We transfected CAD cells with GFP - Eps8 Δ capping and GFP - Eps8 Δ bundling , ( constructs encoding Eps8 mutants impaired in their actin - capping and - bundling activity respectively ) 47 . The expression of GFP - Eps8 Δ capping - mutant , likewise of Eps8 , increased TNT - connected cells . Conversely , no increase upon the expression of GFP - Eps8 Δ bundling - mutant was observed ( Fig . 5a and b , Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . This finding indicates that Eps8 exerts a positive regulation on TNT for - mation via its bundling activity . We , then , evaluated whether Eps8 had any functional consequences by looking at the effect on intercellular vesicle transfer . We observed a significant increase of DiD - positive acceptor cells upon expression of GFP - Eps8 or GFP - Eps8 Δ capping compared to the control , whereas no significant change Figure 3 . CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP act as a network to negatively regulate the number of TNT - connected cells . CAD cells were transiently co - transfected as indicated under the graph . Cells were fixed 14 hrs post - transfection , labeled with fluorescent WGA in order to detect TNTs and observed by confocal microscopy .

Data represent the mean ( ± SEM ) , normalized to control cells arbitrarily set at 100 % , of at least 4 independent experiments . * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ; ns = not significant . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 39632 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep39632 was monitored for GFP - Eps8 Δ bundling ( Fig . 5c , Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Overall this data indicates that Eps8 is a positive regulator of functionally active TNTs and that its actin - bundling activity is required . Discussion The data presented here provides new insights on the cytoskeleton architecture and mechanisms underlying TNT formation and intercellular vesicle transfer in neuronal CAD cells . Our results show that CDC42 , IRSp53 , and VASP act in concert to inhibit TNT formation while concomitantly promoting the extension of filopodia ( Fig . 6 ) . We previously observed a drastic reduction of TNT - connected cells upon overexpression of GFP - VASP in CAD cells 30 . Here , we demonstrate that VASP expression also reduces contact - dependent intercellular vesicle transfer , supporting a negative role of VASP on functional TNTs . Our data also points to IRSp53 as another negative regu - lator of TNT formation and transfer . To exert this function , IRSp53 must interact with downstream partners since no decrease in TNT - connected cells nor vesicle transfer were observed upon overexpression of a mutant form of IRSp53 impaired in binding its downstream partners ( eg , VASP , N - WASP , Wave , mDia and Eps8 32 ) . Nevertheless , we observed a stronger inhibition of TNT formation upon co - expression of IRSp53 and VASP compared to the expression of one or the other alone . This indicates that VASP might cooperate with IRSp53 ( perhaps by act - ing downstream as proposed in filopodia 36 ) , although we cannot exclude that IRSp53 inhibition of TNT forma - tion and function also involves additional interacting partners . More importantly , we showed that activation of CDC42 negatively regulates TNT formation and transfer function . Indeed , while the constitutively active form of the GTPase strongly reduces the number of cells connected via TNTs and intercellular vesicle transfer , overex - pression of the dominant - negative form increases TNT formation without a significant effect on vesicle transfer . This latter observation suggests that the formation of functional TNTs requires additional limiting factors . It is important to note that both IRSp53 - and VASP - mediated inhibition of TNT formation and transfer appears to require CDC42 activity , suggesting that an active CDC42 - IRSp53 - VASP complex is needed to counteract TNT formation and activity . Our data contradicts prior work showing a decrease in TNT formation and elongation upon inhibition of CDC42 26 , 27 , 41 . The contact - dependent intercellular transfer was also shown to require CDC42 activity 48 , 49 . However , all of these studies were performed in non - neuronal cells ( Hela , Jurkat and NK cells ) . Thus , this appar - ent discrepancy could simply reflect cell type - dependent mechanisms of TNT formation , as it has been reported for M - Sec and p53 - dependent mechanisms 29 , 30 . It is also worth pointing out that IRSp53 , VASP , and Eps8 display Figure 4 . VASP and Eps8 ectopic expression have opposite effect on filopodia formation .

The CDC42 / IRSp53 / VASP network has previously been identified as a positive regulator of filopodia forma - tion 36 , 38 . In CAD cells , we observed an increase of actin - rich dorsal protrusions and peripheral vinculin - positive focal adhesions upon overexpression of GFP - VASP . This indicates that VASP also positively regulates filopodia formation in our cellular model . On the other hand , the inhibitory role of the CDC42 / IRSp53 / VASP network in TNT formation reported here suggests that filopodia and TNTs are distinct structures that utilize different mechanisms for their formation ( Fig . 6 ) . In order to investigate this hypothesis , we study the role of Eps8 . Eps8 can coordinate and integrate multiple signaling pathways via the formation of distinct macromolecular com - plexes 50 , 51 . It is involved in the endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases and can transduce signals from Ras to Rac , leading to actin remodeling 51 . Eps8 directly interacts with actin and is capable of capping and bundling actin filaments depending on its downstream ligands 47 . In keeping with the latter notion , Eps8 was shown to play a complex role in filopodia regulation 38 . It acts as a positive regulator of filopodia formation in non - neuronal cells ( Hela and epithelial cells ) , where it was shown to synergize with IRSp53 in bundling actin filaments 38 , 52 . On the other hand , the genetic removal of Eps8 increases the formation of filopodia in primary hippocampal neurons 38 , 40 . This inhibitory function is exerted , instead , through the capping activity of Eps8 triggered by the interaction with Abi1 / 2 , and by its competition with VASP - family proteins for IRSp53 binding . In CAD cells , we observed a striking remodeling of cellular protrusions upon overexpression of GFP - Eps8 . Instead of the abundant peripheral and dorsal filopodia - like protrusions observed in control cells , GFP - Eps8 - transfected cells harbor tiny and curved actin - rich protrusions . This phenotype may correspond to the thick club - like protrusions observed along axon and dendrites in primary neurons upon ectopic expression of Eps8 40 . These observations suggest that Eps8 nega - tively regulates filopodia formation in our cellular model as well as in primary neurons . Interestingly , Eps8 over - expression induced a significant increase in TNT - connected cells and intercellular vesicle transfer , indicating that it may act as a positive regulator of TNT formation . Our data also indicates that Eps8 - mediated TNT induction involves the bundling activity of the protein , while the capping activity does not seem to be required . However , it was previously shown that capping activity of Eps8 is regulated by MAPK - dependent phosphorylation , suggest - ing that modulation of this latter activity rather than an on / off switch may be important in controlling actin - based structures in filopodia as well as in TNTs 53 . Most of the data published in the literature so far points to a synergy with IRSp53 , driving Eps8 bundling activity 38 , 52 . However , IRSp53 is unlikely to contribute to Eps8 - dependent TNT induction in CAD cells as it is a negative regulator of TNT formation . Further work will have to focus on the identification of Eps8 partners in this context . In summary , our results represent the first molecular evidence that TNTs and filopodia may be completely different structures , which invalidates the hypothesis that TNTs could arise from a subset of filopodia . In fact , our data rather suggests that TNT precursors are different structures from the beginning . Furthermore , the observa - tion that the same actin regulators may be involved in filopodia and TNT formation , but acting in opposite ways , raises the intriguing possibility of a “switch” between the two structures . Interestingly , our laboratory previously reported that when a growing TNT - like protrusion attaches to a distant cell , the filopodia of this cell subsequently retracts 30 . This constitutes an additional hint for a regulated balance between TNTs and filopodia . Whether this balance results from a signaling pathway having a physiological relevance , or if it is the consequence of a limiting factor , remains to be determined but nevertheless calls for further studies both at the molecular and ultrastruc - tural level . Methods Cell culture , transfection and DNA constructs . Mouse neuronal CAD cells were kindly given by Hubert Laude ( Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique , Jouy - en - Josas , France ) and were cultured in Gibco TM Opti - MEM © ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s Figure 6 . TNT and filopodia formation involve the same actin regulatory complexes acting in opposite ways . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 39632 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep39632 instructions .
