In this study , we investigated how COVID - 19 school closures were associated with gaps and losses in Brazilian students’ reading skills . We contrasted the reading comprehension and fluency of 2 nd - to 4 th - graders in 2022 with a 2019 cohort . Furthermore , we investigated how 2022 5 th graders’ reading comprehension and fluency skills have improved since 2019 . Overall , results showed that COVID - 19 school closures were associated with gaps but not losses in reading comprehension and fluency . Therefore , these skills should be targets of educational interventions . Keywords : covid - 19 , school closures , reading fluency , reading comprehension 1 . Introduction The World Health Organization announced the COVID - 19 pandemic in March 2020 ( Hu et al . , 2021 ) . Since children and adolescents were frequently asymptomatic , researchers hypothesized that they could be super - spreaders of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus ( Bi et al . , 2020 ) . Soon , school closures were adopted in several countries as an attempt to reduce the spread of the virus ( for an overview of response across countries , see Lindblad et al . , 2021 ) . Brazil is one of the countries whose schools remained closed for longer ( World Bank , 2022 ) . The first Brazilian schools closed in March 2020 ; some were still closed by March 2022 . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f School closures in Brazil led to several challenges and unequal student learning opportunities . Most Brazilian teachers from public elementary schools have reported that they did not receive training on virtual and distance learning tools ( Cipriani et al . , 2021 ; Dias et al . , 2020 ; Instituto Rui Barbosa , 2020 ) . Furthermore , many teachers and students did not have access to high - speed internet or computers and tablets at home ( Oliveira & Junior , 2021 ; Silva et al . , 2021 ) . It is estimated that , during the pandemic , 52 % of Brazilian teachers did not have a personal computer , and only 31 % of Brazilian children enrolled in public schools had access to computers or tablets ( FCC et al . , 2020 ) . Finally , synchronous classes were more the exception than the rule ( Carvalho & Moura , 2021 ) . A survey showed that 82 % of early child - education teachers communicated with their students via WhatsApp , and only 20 % used virtual learning systems ( FCC et al . , 2020 ) . The lack of teachers training for online instruction , poor access to technologies by both teachers and students , and poor teacher - student communication during COVID - 19 school closure in Brazil may have negatively impacted school achievement ( Oliveira et al . , 2020 ) . Overall , studies have shown that COVID - 19 school closures impaired school achievement ( Conto et al . , 2021 ; Patarapichayatham et al . , 2021 ; Skar et al . , 2021 ; also see Donnelly & Patrinos , 2021 ) . In particular , COVID - 19 school closures have been associated with gaps in students’ reading skills ( Ardington et al . , 2021 ; Hevia et al . , 2022 ; Lichand et al . , 2022 ) . For example , Hevia and colleagues ( 2022 ) compared the performance of 10 to 15 years - old Mexican students assessed in 2021 with the performance of a cohort assessed in 2019 . Results showed that the 2021 cohort had worse performance in a reading task than the 2019 cohort , with stronger effects for low SES students . Gaps in reading skills have also been found in students as young as 2 nd graders . Using a difference - of - difference approach , Ardington and colleagues ( 2021 ) compared the reading skills of South African students’ cohorts assessed pre and during the pandemic ( 2019 vs . 2020 ) . Their results estimated a reading gap between 57 % and 70 % in 2020 for 2 nd - graders and between 62 % and 81 % in 2020 for 4 th - graders . These J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f studies revealed that COVID - 19 school closures led to gaps in students’ reading skills across different cultures and languages . There is also evidence that COVID - 19 school closures were associated with gaps in Brazilian students’ reading skills . A yearly survey by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics asks parents if their 6 - and 7 - years old children can read and write . From 2012 to 2019 , the number of parents that indicated their children could not read or write decreased : 28 . 2 % in 2012 compared with 25 . 1 % in 2019 . However , when schools were closed due to COVID - 19 , this number increased significantly , above 2012 rates : 32 . 9 % in 2020 and 40 . 8 % in 2021 ( IBGE , 2021 ; Todos pela Educação , 2021 ) . Furthermore , an assessment conducted by public schools from São Paulo ( Secretaria de Educação de São Paulo , 2022 ) indicated that 2021 5 th - graders’ scores in a Brazilian - Portuguese task were 8 . 58 % lower than the 2019 cohort . Before the pandemic , the average Brazilian performance in the Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) reading assessments was already below the OECD average ( OECD , 2019 ) . The COVID - 19 school closures may have exacerbated the gaps in Brazilian students’ reading skills relative to other countries since Brazilian schools remained closed for longer without an efficient remote instruction plan . In the present study , we have investigated the effects of COVID - 19 school closures on Brazilian students’ reading comprehension and reading fluency skills , using both a cross - sectional and a longitudinal design . We have assessed reading comprehension and fluency because these skills are crucial for students’ school success ( US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES , 2000 ) . Reading comprehension is defined as the process of extracting or making meaning from a written text ( Anderson et al . , 1988 ) , which depends on the reader’s cognitive skills and previous knowledge , the text’s characteristics , and the reading context ( Fuchs et al . , 2012 ; Wixson & Peters , 1987 ) . In contrast , reading fluency is defined the ability to read words rapidly and accurately with proper expression ( Hudson et al . , 2011 ) . Fluent reading has been indicated as necessary because it allows students to free cognitive resources J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f dedicated to decoding and , instead , engage them in reading comprehension ( Cutting & Scarborough , 2006 ; Fuchs et al . , 1988 ; Jenkins et al . , 2003 ) . Investigating the impacts of COVID - 19 school closures on reading comprehension and fluency is the first step to identifying intervention targets . 1 . 1 . Present study We investigated the effects of COVID - 19 school closures on Brazilian students’ reading comprehension and fluency skills in two studies . In the first study , we investigated how COVID - 19 school closures were associated with learning gaps ( i . e . , delays in students’ skills development ) . We contrasted the performance of a cohort of 2 nd - to 4 th - graders assessed in 2019 with the performance of a 2022 cohort . If COVID - 19 school closures negatively impacted students’ reading skills acquisition and improvement , then we should observe a worse performance in the 2022 cohort in all grades . There was no evidence of differences between the 2019 and 2022 cohorts besides the instruction format ( in - person vs . remote ) . In the second study , we investigated how COVID - 19 school closures were associated with learning losses ( i . e . , forgetting or a decrease in students’ scores after the pandemic ) . We contrasted the reading comprehension and fluency skills of students assessed in 2019 , as 2 nd graders , with their own performance in 2022 , as 5 th graders , controlling for SES . If COVID - 19 school closures were associated with reading skills losses , we should observe that students have lower or equal performance in 2022 compared to their previous performance assessed in 2019 . 2 . Study 1 : Cross - sectional analyses In Study 1 , we contrasted the performance of a cohort of 2 nd - to 4 th - graders assessed in 2019 , before school closures , with a cohort assessed in 2022 , after schools returned to the in - person format . We used a series of ANOVAs to investigate how COVID - 19 school closures were associated with gaps in students’ reading comprehension and fluency skills . 2 . 1 . Methods 2 . 1 . 1 . Participants J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f In this study , we conducted a secondary data analysis based on a diagnostic assessment organized by a Northeastern Brazilian city’s public school system ( Data is available at OSF : https : / / osf . io / j6xsb / ) . The city has an estimated population of 212 , 437 people , and its GDP per capita is 21 , 343 . 10 Brazilian reais ( IBGE , 2020 ; INEP , 2020 ) . Its school system has 65 schools ( 38 % Elementary Schools ) and supports more than 30 , 000 students . They assessed students from a randomly selected sample of 10 schools ( i . e . , about 1 / 3 of local schools ) . This Northeastern Brazilian school system has consistently presented outstanding scores in the last five national assessments of educational systems ( i . e . , Prova Brasil , INEP , 2022 ) . Therefore , possible changes in students’ reading skills between 2019 and 2022 may occur due to school closures and not by an inconsistent school system performance . It is important to notice that results observed within this school system may not be representative of other Brazilian systems , particularly the underperforming ones . We compared the performance of two 2 nd - to 4 th - graders cohorts—one assessed in 2019 and another assessed in 2022 . Students were stratified by each class of the participant schools . Within each class , some students were randomly selected for this study . In 2022 , more students were selected within each class since there was an increased risk of absence as schools transitioned to the in - person format . Their sample size and gender distribution are presented by grade in Table 1 . Table 1 . Sample size and gender by cohort . Grade 2019 Cohort 2022 Cohort N % Female N % Female 2 nd grade 116 49 % 270 55 % 3 rd grade 122 55 % 285 51 % 4 th grade 119 50 % 283 46 % Total 357 52 % 838 51 % The participant school system adopted a remote learning format during COVID - 19 school closures . However , schools were free to adapt their teaching approach . Students from J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f most schools received academic materials and were presented with asynchronous lectures . This approach was similar to the approach adopted by most Brazilian public schools . Remote schooling was available in all Brazilian states during COVID - 19 school closures ( UNICEF , 2021 ) , and 70 % of Brazilian school systems reported the conclusion of the 2020 academic year ( UNDIME , 2021 ) . However , at the municipality level , approaches varied a lot . A study conducted with 3 , 672 Brazilian municipalities ( out of 5 , 570 existing municipalities in Brazil ) showed that 95 , 3 % of them sent print materials to students and monitored their progress asynchronously via instant messaging services ( UNDIME , 2021 ) . Nevertheless , it is estimated that 5 , 5 million Brazilian children had no or limited access to education during COVID - 19 school closures ( UNICEF , 2021 ) . Therefore , the results of the current student may not be generalized to other Brazilian municipalities . Within the school system that took part in the present study , schools remained closed from March 2020 to August 2021 and adopted a hybrid system in the second semester ( i . e . , August to December ) of 2021 . In - person classes returned in late February of 2022 . 2 . 1 . 2 . General Procedures and Materials Both cohorts completed the same reading assessment , so it is possible to compare their performance . Trained research assistants assessed both cohorts at the beginning of the Brazilian school year ( i . e . , March , the second month of instruction ) . The research assistants used scripts to standardize the assessments . Reading comprehension was assessed in groups in students’ classrooms , and reading fluency was assessed individually in silent rooms of the schools . Students completed the reading comprehension assessment first , followed by the reading fluency assessment . The tasks are described below . 2 . 1 . 2 . 1 . Reading comprehension Reading comprehension was assessed with the Brazilian Reading Test – Sentence Comprehension ( TELCS ; Vilhena et al . , 2016 ; Vilhena & Pinheiro , 2020 ) . TELCS is a multiple - choice task composed of 36 sentences whose last word has been omitted . The sentences have J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f between 8 and 20 words . Five words are presented as response choices to complete each sentence . The response choices—presented under parenthesis , following the corresponding sentence—have visual ( i . e . , number of letters ) , phonological ( e . g . , number of rhymes ) , or semantic ( i . e . , same semantic class , like occupation ) similarities . The sentences and response choices were organized in two columns and printed on an A4 paper sheet with black 12 Arial font . First , the research assistants gave oral instructions to the participants . Then , participants completed four practice items orally , with no time limit , and received feedback from the research assistants . The testing phase started afterward , and participants completed the task silently without assistance . Participants had a time limit of 5 minutes to complete as many sentences as possible . One point was given for each sentence correctly completed ( maximum score = 36 ) . 2 . 1 . 2 . 2 . Reading fluency Reading fluency was assessed with the Reading Fluency Test , developed by Instituto Alfa e Beto . In this test , students were presented with a text they read aloud for one minute . Then , the examiner computed the number of words correctly read per minute ( WCPM ) . The text ( i . e . , Som , Luz e Seus Efeitos Especiais – Sound , Light , and their Special Effects ) has a scientific theme . It is part of an Elementary School Reading Collection ( Instituto Alfa e Beto , 2019 ) . It was composed of 173 words extracted from a corpus of the most used Brazilian - Portuguese words in classic children’s novels ( e . g . , Pinocchio & Alice in Wonderland ) . The text was composed of simple and subordinated clauses , and its development was based on the reading level proposed by Fountas and Pinnell ( 2016 ) . The text was printed on an A4 paper sheet , black 12 Arial font , with one sentence per line . Psychometrics analyses with this task indicate good internal consistency ( Cronbach’s alpha > 0 . 8 ) and external validity ( significant moderate correlation with other reading tasks ) .

Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics are presented by grade and cohort in Table 2 . In general , 2022 participants had worse performance in the reading comprehension task ( i . e . , lower scores in TELCS ) and the reading fluency task ( i . e . , lower WCPM ) than 2019 participants . Furthermore , 2022 students’ performance was more heterogeneous than in 2019 . Results indicated that , on average , 2022 2 nd - graders scored 45 . 6 % in TELCS and read 50 . 6 % WCPM relative to 2019 2 nd - graders ; 2022 3 rd - graders scored 69 . 2 % in TELCS and read 62 . 7 % WCPM relative to 2019 3 rd - graders ; and 2022 4 th - graders scored 82 . 6 % in TELCS and read 86 . 9 % WCPM relative to 2019 4 th - graders . We also investigated differences in the tasks’ distributions between each cohort at the grade level , using the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test . For TELCS , results indicated distribution differences between 2019 and 2022 2 nd ( D = 0 . 39 , p < . 001 ) , 3 rd ( D = 0 . 40 , p < . 001 ) , and 4 th graders ( D = 0 . 21 , p < . 001 ) . Similarly , results suggested WCMP’s distribution differences between 2019 and 2022 2 nd ( D = 0 . 46 , p < . 001 ) , 3 rd ( D = 0 . 50 , p < . 001 ) , and 4 th graders ( D = 0 . 23 , p < . 001 ) . These results suggest that COVID - 19 school closures negatively impacted students’ reading skills . Specifically , the effects were more pronounced for students in earlier grades , who received less in - person instruction before the pandemic , than students in more advanced grades . For example , 2022 2nd graders only had in - person instruction after schools reopened , whereas 2022 4th graders had at least one year of in - person instruction before the pandemic . In addition to central measures , COVID - 19 school closure effects were also reflected in the tasks’ distributions . Table 2 . Descriptive Statistics . Note .

Cohort Comparisons We conducted a 2x3 ANOVA to investigate differences between cohorts and grades in the reading comprehension task ( i . e . , TELCS’s scores ) . As illustrated in Figure 1a , the ANOVA showed a significant main effect of cohort , F ( 1 , 1189 ) = 71 . 46 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 06 , in line with the prediction that COVID - 19 school closures were associated with reading comprehension gaps . The ANOVA also showed a significant main effect of grade , F ( 2 , 1189 ) = 230 . 52 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 28 . However , there was no significant interaction between cohort and grade , F ( 2 , 1189 ) = 0 . 60 , p = . 55 , η 2 = . 001 . Tukey HSD posthoc analyses indicated that the 2019 cohort had higher scores than the 2022 cohort ( p < . 001 ) , 4 th - graders had higher scores than 2 nd - and 3 rd - graders , and 3 rd - graders had higher scores than 2 nd - graders ( all p < . 001 ) . We also ran a series of Tukey HSD posthoc analyses to compare each possible cohort vs . grade pair . Results indicated significant differences across all pairs ( all p < . 01 ) , except between 2019 2 nd - graders and 2022 3 rd - graders ( p = . 52 ) , and between 2019 3 rd - graders and 2022 4 th - graders ( p = . 31 ) . In other words , results indicated at least one year delay in the development of students’ reading comprehension skills associated with COVID - 19 school closures . We also conducted a 2x3 ANOVA to investigate differences between cohorts and grades in the fluency task ( i . e . , participants’ WCPM ) . As illustrated in Figure 1b , the ANOVA showed a significant main effect of cohort , F ( 1 , 1189 ) = 132 . 62 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 10 , in line with the prediction that COVID - 19 school closures were associated with reading fluency gaps . The ANOVA also showed a significant main effect of grade , F ( 2 , 1189 ) = 321 . 22 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 35 , and a J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f significant interaction between cohort and grade , F ( 2 , 1189 ) = 7 . 18 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 01 . Tukey HSD posthoc analyses indicated that the 2019 cohort had greater WCPM than the 2022 cohort ( p < . 001 ) , 4 th - graders had greater WCPM than 2 nd - and 3 rd - graders , and 3 rd - graders had greater WCPM than 2 nd - graders ( all p < . 001 ) . We also ran a series of Tukey HSD posthoc analyses to compare each possible cohort vs . grade pair . Results indicated significant differences across all pairs ( all p < . 01 ) , except between 2019 2 nd - graders and 2022 3 rd - graders ( p = . 98 ) , and between 2019 3 rd - graders and 2022 4 th - graders ( p = . 98 ) . These results indicate that there is also a delay in the development of participants’ reading fluency associated with COVID - 19 school closures . Figure 1 . Scores of 2019 and 2022 cohorts in a ) Reading comprehension ( TELCS total score ) and b ) Reading Fluency ( WCPM ) . Note . TELCS = Brazilian Reading Test – Sentence Comprehension ; WCPM = Number of words correctly read per minute ; Each dot represents one participant . Previous studies have shown that COVID - 19 school closures were associated with gaps in students’ general reading skills ( Ardington et al . , 2021 ; Hevia et al . , 2022 ; Lichand et al . , 2022 ) . The results from the present study corroborate this pattern and expand these results to J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f specific skills—reading fluency and comprehension—in Brazilian Portuguese . In particular , we observed one year delay in 2022 participants’ performance , both in reading comprehension and fluency . For example , 2022 3 rd graders , who received about two years of remote schooling , had performance equivalent to the 2 nd graders in 2019 . These results mean that students still advanced their knowledge during the two years of school closures . However , the remote school format was insufficient for them to reach the performance expected for their corresponding grade . In summary , these results indicate a negative effect of COVID - 19 school closures on students’ reading comprehension and fluency . 3 . Study 2 : Longitudinal Analysis A critical limitation of Study 1 is that a cross - sectional analysis does not allow for investigating student skills losses . To address this gap , we conducted a second study . In Study 2 , we contrasted participants’ performance in reading comprehension and fluency tasks in 2019 , before COVID - 19 school closures , with their performance in 2022 . 3 . 1 . Methods 3 . 1 . 1 . Participants In this study , we also conducted a secondary analysis of data collected by the public school system of a Northeastern Brazilian city . One hundred and three participants ( 48 % female ) who completed Study 1 in 2019 , as 2 nd - graders , were also assessed in 2022 , as 5 th - graders . Here , we analyze how participants’ scores grew between the two assessments . 3 . 1 . 2 . General Procedures and Materials Participants completed TELCS and the Reading Fluency Test both in 2019 and 2022 . Additionally , their parents or legal guardians completed a socioeconomic status questionnaire in 2019 . In 2019 , 116 2 nd - graders were recruited , as described in Study 1 . Between 2019 and 2022 , 7 students moved to different schools . The Northeastern Brazilian city school system identified participants’ new schools and invited them to participate in the new study phase . Those who agreed to participate ( N = 103 ; attrition = 11 . 2 % ) were assessed in their schools . All J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f participants completed the Reading Fluency Test individually in 2019 and 2022 . In 2019 , participants completed TELCS in groups , in their classrooms . In 2022 , TELCS was also completed in groups , except in schools where only one participant was enrolled ( N = 5 ) . See Study 1 for the description of TELCS and the Reading Fluency Test . Here , we describe the socioeconomic status questionnaire . 3 . 1 . 2 . 1 . Socioeconomic Status Questionnaire Participants’ socioeconomic status ( SES ) was investigated with the Socioeconomic Status Questionnaire . This questionnaire , completed by participants’ parents or legal guardians , investigated how many children lived in students’ houses and their parent’s marital status , educational attainment , and occupation . Finally , this questionnaire also investigated if students had a washing machine in their houses , lived on a paved street , and if their families were in a national cash transfer program . Students’ SES was then computed via an IRT - graded model , which integrated five measures : parental educational attainment and marital status , and if the family had a washing machine , lived on a paved street , and was enrolled in the cash transfer program . In this questionnaire , scores closer to zero indicate SES approximate to the sample’s mean ; negative scores indicate SES below the sample’s mean , and positive scores indicate SES above the sample’s mean . In general , a higher score in this questionnaire indicates a higher SES . 3 . 2 . Results and Discussion SES data were missing from 20 participants . We used the R package “mice” ( i . e . , multivariate imputation via chained equations ) to impute the missing data . The package “mice” assumes missing at random and computes multiple imputations using linear regressions . We computed 10 datasets , with seed set to 5 . Results did not differ between original and imputed data ( see more information at OSF : https : / / osf . io / h3gs9 ) . Therefore , we here present the results with imputed data to avoid missingness . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f First , we present descriptive statistics . Second , we present the zero - order correlations between 2019 and 2022 participants’ TELCS scores and WCPM , followed by the association between these variables controlling for SES . Finally , we present performance changes both at the group and individual levels . 3 . 2 . 1 . Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statics are presented by assessment year in Table 3 . Overall , participants’ performance in the reading comprehension task ( i . e . , TELCS scores ) and the reading fluency task ( i . e . , WCPM ) improved from 2019 to 2022 , indicating that reading losses were infrequent . Participants’ scores in TELCS increased by about 12 points from 2019 to 2022 , and they correctly read approximately 56 more words in 2022 than in 2019 . Table 3 . Descriptive Statistics . Note .

Association between 2019 and 2022 scores J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Figure 2 shows that the correlation between participants’ scores in 2019 and 2022 was significant and moderate . Students with higher TELCS scores in 2019 also had higher TELCS scores in 2022 . Similarly , students who correctly read more words in 2019 also read more words in 2022 . These results indicate that the development of students’ reading skills is at least partially built upon their previous knowledge . Figure 2 .

Association between 2019 and 2022 scores controlling for SES To explore the SES effects on students’ performance , we combined participants in two groups : high SES ( above the median ) and low SES ( below the median ) . As shown in Figure 3 , both in 2019 and 2022 , high SES students were more likely to have better reading comprehension ( i . e . , higher TELCS scores ) and reading fluency skills ( i . e . , WCPM ) than low SES students .

We tested the SES effects on participants’ performance using continuous data . We conducted two linear regression models , one for reading comprehension and one for reading fluency . First , we investigated how 2019 TELCS scores , SES , and their interaction term predicted 2022 TELCS scores . Then , we investigated how 2019 WCPM , SES , and their interaction term predicted 2022 WCPM . The main results are presented in Table 4 . Table 4 . Linear regression models . Note .

For reading comprehension , diagnostic analyses indicated two influential cases ( Cooks’ distance > 0 . 5 ) . These observations were excluded from the final TELCS regression model . Results indicated that a higher TELCS score in 2019 was associated with higher TELCS scores in 2022 . However , higher SES in 2019 was not associated with higher TELCS scores in 2022 , and there was no significant interaction between 2019 TELCS scores and SES . Similar results were found for reading fluency . Participants with greater WCPM in 2019 also had greater WCPM in 2022 . However , there was no significant effect of 2019 SES on 2022 WCPM and no interaction between 2019 WCPM and SES . 3 . 2 . 2 . 3 . Difference in 2019 and 2022 performance Finally , we investigated changes in participants’ performance by subtracting 2022 TELCS scores from 2019 TELCS scores and 2022 WCPM from 2019 WCPM . Positive difference scores indicate improvements from 2019 to 2022 , difference scores equal to zero indicate no improvements from 2019 to 2022 , and negative difference scores indicate losses from 2019 to 2022 . For reading comprehension , results indicated a mean increase of 11 . 72 ( SD = 6 . 75 ; MIN = - 4 ; MAX = 33 ) points in students’ TELCS scores , as shown in Figure 4 . This change corresponds to , on average , an increase of 2 . 33 standard deviations from 2019 to 2022 . Two participants had identical scores in both time points , and four had worse performance in 2022 than in 2019 . There was no significant association between 2019 TELCS scores and the difference scores ( r = - . 12 , p = . 23 ) . This result is consistent with the fact that participants who had better skills in 2019 tended to have better skills in 2022 . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Figure 4 . Differences in Reading Comprehension Performance between 2019 and 2022 . Note . TELCS = Brazilian Reading Test – Sentence Comprehension ; Each point represents one participant . For reading fluency , results indicated a mean increase of 56 . 13 ( SD = 30 . 45 ; MIN = - 95 ; MAX = 129 ) WCPM , as shown in Figure 5 . This result corresponds to , on average , an increase of 2 standard deviations from 2019 to 2022 . Overall , most participants improved their performance between 2019 and 2022 . However , losses were observed among three participants . No cases of students with the same WCPM in 2019 and 2022 were observed . There was a negative association between the 2019 WCPM and the difference scores ( r = - . 31 , p < . 01 ) , suggesting that participants who correctly read more words in 2019 improved less than participants with poorer reading fluency in 2019 . Possibly , students with poor performance in J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2019 had more space to improve their reading fluency with educational interventions than those who had already mastered it in 2019 . Figure 5 . Differences in Reading Fluency Performance between 2019 and 2022 . Note . WCPM = Number of words correctly read per minute ; Each point represents one participant . Overall , the longitudinal results indicate that skill loss was infrequent . These results corroborate previous longitudinal studies that showed that students’ reading comprehension and fluency skills continued to grow during the pandemic but at a slower rate ( Domingue et al . , 2021 ; Schuurman et al . , 2021 ) . Unlike previous studies ( Hevia et al . , 2022 ; Schuurman et al . , 2021 ) , we did not find strong evidence that 2019 SES explained participants’ performance after the COVID - 19 school closures . Possibly , SES effects could have been weakened by low SES J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f variance , given that only students from a public school system composed our sample . In Brazil , families with high SES typically enroll their children in private schools . 4 . General Discussion Recent studies have shown that COVID - 19 school closures are associated with gaps in students’ reading skills ( Conto et al . , 2021 ; Patarapichayatham et al . , 2021 ; Skar et al . , 2021 ; also see Donnelly & Patrinos , 2021 ) . Our cross - sectional results corroborate these studies and expand their findings to reading comprehension and reading fluency in Brazilian - Portuguese . We found that 2022 2 nd - to 4 th - graders had a one - year delay in reading comprehension and reading fluency relative to the proficiency level of a cohort assessed in 2019 . For example , 2022 4 th graders were in 2 nd grade when schools closed . Their reading performance in 2022 corresponded to the performance of 2019 3 rd graders . This means that they advanced their reading skills in about one year , but still had about one - year gap . In the school system that composed our study , in - person classes were suspended for approximately two years . During this period , children received school materials to study at home and had virtual contact with their teachers . The remote school intervention—additionally to home literacy activities not assessed by our study—may have provided students with tools to advance their reading skills . However , results suggest that it has not been enough for them to reach the expected grade - level performance . While we observed reading gaps in the cross - sectional study , our longitudinal study indicated that most students have not experienced reading losses or stagnation . Overall , students’ performance in both the reading comprehension and the reading fluency tasks improved from 2019 to 2022 . These results corroborate previous findings with American and Dutch students ( Domingue et al . , 2021 ; Schuurman et al . , 2021 ) . In an accelerated longitudinal design , Schuurman and colleagues ( 2021 ) followed 3 rd - , 4 th - , and 5 th - graders and showed that their reading comprehension skills improved during COVID - 19 school closures , but at a slower rate . Using a longitudinal design , Domingue and colleagues ( 2021 ) found similar results for J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f reading fluency of 1 st - to 4 th - graders . The remote school format possibly helped most students retain and—to some extent—advance their consolidated previous knowledge . Our longitudinal analyses also investigated how SES was associated with progress in students’ reading comprehension and reading fluency during COVID - 19 school closures . Like previous findings ( e . g . , Hevia et al . , 2022 ; Schuurman et al . , 2021 ) , we observed that students with lower SES had worse performance in the reading comprehension and reading fluency tasks than students with higher SES . However , our analyses did not reach significance . Two main factors may explain this result . First , only students from public schools composed our sample . In Brazil , public schools usually serve children from lower SES backgrounds , whereas children from higher SES typically attend private schools ( IBGE , 2017 ; Soares , 2006 ) . Therefore , our sample may have been biased to the lower SES level , resulting in a weak SES effect . Second , our sample was composed of students from the same school system . Therefore , the similar educational opportunities received by different students from our sample may have narrowed possible SES gaps ( see von Hippel et al . , 2018 , for a discussion about how schools may reduce achievement inequalities ) . In particular , the measures taken by the school system to support remote learning may have successfully promoted equitable opportunities for students from more vulnerable SES backgrounds . 4 . 1 . Insights from non - COVID - 19 school closures Before COVID - 19 , the effects of school closures on students’ reading skills have been wildly studied in the context of Summer break ( Allington & McGill - Franzen , 2017 ) . These studies may provide insights into interpreting our results about learning gaps and losses . A robust body of evidence has shown that the growth of students’ reading skills slows down or becomes negative during Summer break ( Alexander et al . , 2007 ; Cooper et al . , 1996 ; Kuhfeld , 2019 ; von Hippel et al . , 2018 ) . The cohort of students we assessed in 2022 was starting Elementary school when their instruction was disrupted by COVID - 19 . In other words , they had not received systematic literacy instruction when schools closed , in particular 2 nd J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f graders . Similar to the effects of Summer break , the COVID - 19 disruption combined with students’ limited previous educational opportunities may have caused the gaps we observed between the 2022 and the 2019 cohorts . Studies also show that the reading gaps caused by Summer break can be narrowed through continuous educational interventions and reading activities ( for a review , see Kim & Quinn , 2013 ) . In particular , a strong association exists between the amount of reading a child can do and gains in their reading achievement ( Anderson et al . , 1988 ) . The 5 th grade students that took part in our longitudinal investigation had developed foundational literacy skills before COVID - 19 school closures—read approximately 55 WCPM in 2019 as 2 nd graders – and , thus , were able to independently engage in reading activities . Additionally , their reading skills in 2019 predicted their reading skills in 2022 . Therefore , 2022 5 th graders’ previous knowledge combined with the educational opportunities from remote schooling may have prevented losses and scaffolded the development of their reading comprehension and fluency skills . 4 . 2 . Open questions for future studies As this study conducted a “natural” experiment with secondary data analysis , more studies are still needed to understand better how COVID - 19 school closure impacted students’ reading comprehension and fluency skills . In the current study , we did not have access to other sociodemographic and cognitive measures from our sample , which could explain the variance of students’ reading skills and interact with the effects of COVID - 19 school closure . Thus , how COVID - 19 school closures impacted students’ skills based on individual differences and other sociodemographic factors remains an open question . Furthermore , more studies are needed to understand the impacts of COVID - 19 school closure on other Brazilian school systems ( including public and private ones ) . Our analyses investigated a school system with outstanding performance in Brazilian educational assessments ( Prova Brasil , INEP , 2022 ) . Given the quality of this school system , its response to COVID - 19 and students’ previous knowledge may be different from other Brazilian schools . As J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f many Brazilian children were denied their right to education due to COVID - 19 school closures , impact studies within other school systems are crucial to informing intervention studies and public policy . Additionally , the current study may not be generalized to other countries / languages , as reading fluency and comprehension may depend on contextual factors ( Fuchs et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , the effects of COVID - 19 school closure on reading skills should be a target of future studies from different countries , as there is still no equity in COVID - 19 vaccine access ( Van de Pas et al . , 2022 ) , and the virus is still disrupting daily activities across the globe . A good diagnostic of the COVID - 19 school closures impacts is a first step to designing solid interventions and promoting educational opportunities for the more vulnerable population . In this study , we have only investigated the impacts of COVID - 19 school closure on reading skills . However , recent Brazilian reports also indicate an impact of school closures on mathematics skills ( Prova Brasil , INEP , 2022 ) . Future studies should investigate the impacts of COVID - 19 on other school subjects in both public and private Brazilian and international school systems . Another important open question is how COVID - 19 school closures impacted students beyond school achievement . In the current study , we compared the performance of a 2019 cohort—assessed before the pandemic—with a 2022 cohort—assessed after the pandemic . Since both cohorts were sampled from the same schools , they may have similar sociodemographic characteristics . However , pre - and post - COVID - 19 students may differ in many other ways . For example , recent studies have indicated that COVID - 19 impacted students’ socioemotional skills ( Egan et al . , 2021 ) , executive functions ( Frolli et al . , 2021 ) , and ocular health ( Aslan & Sahinoglu - Keskek , 2021 ) . Future studies should investigate the impacts of COVID - 19 on students’ profiles and control for differences between cohorts when investigating the impacts of COVID - 19 school closures . 4 . 3 . Lessons for the Brazilian educational system J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f The COVID - 19 pandemic has left deep marks in Brazil . In 2020 , Brazil was the pandemic ' s epicenter , and the country broke fatality rates records ( Brizzi et al . , 2022 ; Neiva et al . , 2020 ) . Regarding education , Brazilian schools shut down at the beginning of 2020 to mitigate the spread of COVID - 19 but had no action plan to support remote learning or to return to in - person activities ( FCC et al . , 2020 ; Instituto Rui Barbosa , 2020 ) . Most schools only returned to a full in - person format by the beginning of 2022 . A UNICEF study estimated that 5 , 5 million Brazilian children had limited or no access to education during COVID - 19 school closures ( UNDIME , 2021 ) . Therefore , Brazilian school achievement , which was already low before the pandemic ( OECD , 2019 ) , may have regressed . Indeed , the most recent Brazilian educational assessment estimated one - to two - year gaps in Brazilian students ' reading and mathematics skills ( Prova Brasil , INEP , 2022 ) . In the current study , we investigated the effects of almost two years of COVID - 19 school closure within a Brazilian school system with a consistently notable performance before the pandemic . Importantly , this school system has supported students with print materials and asynchronous classes . Our results showed that the two - year school closures resulted in a one - year gap in students’ reading comprehension and fluency skills . Furthermore , negative impacts were more pronounced for students who had not developed literacy before school closures . Three main conclusions arise from these results : 1 ) COVID - 19 school closures can harm even successful school systems ; 2 ) It is possible to make little but significant progress in remote format if systematic educational measures are taken ; 3 ) It is essential to develop student’s literacy in early grades . If COVID - 19 school closures can harm even successful systems , it can exacerbate gaps in underperforming ones . In other words , several Brazilian students from underperforming schools may be at risk for reading difficulties . Brazilian school systems must assess their students’ reading skills and formulate a solid diagnosis . Identifying where students’ difficulties J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f lie—e . g . , if at phonological awareness , letter knowledge , decoding skills , reading fluency , comprehension—is a key to implementing effective interventions . Within the school system assessed in this study , most schools followed the same measures to support their students during COVID - 19 school closures . Differently , in Brazil , there was no coordinated action coming from the federal level to school districts or from some school districts to its schools . This means that more systematic and coordinated education plans are needed in Brazil . Specifically , the Brazilian educational system should study lessons learned from COVID - 19 school closures to plan remote instruction for unlikely but possible new school closures . Finally , it is important to develop students’ literacy skills early on . Traditionally , the Brazilian school curriculum indicated that students should develop literacy skills by the end of 2 nd grade ( see Brazil , BNCC , 2018 ) . However , many students moved to more advanced grades without acquiring literacy skills . Since 2019 , a new curriculum suggests that Brazilian students can and must learn to read by the end of 1 st grade ( Brazil , PNA , 2019 ) . If students knew how to read , they could practice independently . Thus , their prior reading skills could support acquiring new knowledge and back up their school progress in unusual conditions , like COVID - 19 school closures . 5 . Conclusion In summary , this study showed that COVID - 19 school closures were mainly associated with gaps—but not losses—in Brazilian 2 nd - to 5 th - graders’ reading comprehension and reading fluency skills . 2 nd - to 4 th - graders improved their reading skills in about a year but experienced approximately a one - year gap . Furthermore , this study showed that students that had developed foundational literacy skills in 2 nd grade , before COVID - 19 school closures , continued to improve their reading skills up to 5 th grade , even in the remote school format . These results have important implications . First , prolonged school closures can cause reading gaps ; losses are also possible but may be rare . Second , although the remote school format can promote J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f students’ reading comprehension and fluency skills , its effects have been non - optimal . Third , students must develop foundational literacy skills early on . Solid early literacy skills may scaffold students’ reading fluency and comprehension growth and , to some extent , prevent adverse effects resulting from possible school disruptions . Finally , it is essential to diagnose how COVID - 19 school closures impacted reading comprehension and fluency and how educational interventions should target these skills .
