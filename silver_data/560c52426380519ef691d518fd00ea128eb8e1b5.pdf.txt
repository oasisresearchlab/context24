EDELHOCH Clinical Endocrinology Branch , National Institute of Arthritis , Diabetes , and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20205 Communicated by J . E . Rall , July 19 , 1982 ABSTRACT A method of preparing homogeneous coated ves - icles that eliminates the high sucrose concentrations heretofore used is presented . It is shown that sucrose at high concentrations dissociates the coat from coated vesicles . This reaction can explain the presence of empty coats observed with preparations obtained with high concentrations of sucrose . The protein and membrane lipid components have been analyzed by the intrinsic tryptophan and extrinsic diphenylhexatriene fluorescence , respectively . Anal - ysis of mixtures of coated vesicles and baskets resolved the con - tributions of the two species to the fluorescence curves . The role of coated pit regions ofplasma membranes in receptor - mediated endocytosis ( of lipoproteins , glycoproteins , and pep - tide and nonpeptide hormones ) has been well documented ( 1 - 9 ) . These regions also serve as a means of recycling mem - brane after transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction ( 10 ) . Coated pits and coated vesicles ( CVs ) have been shown to be involved in secretory processes ( 11 , 12 ) and in intracellular protein transfer ( 13 ) . Cellular processes involving coated structures are readily observable by electron micrography because the coat possesses a characteristic polygonal structure . Pearse isolated the protein responsible for the membrane coat from coated vesicles and called it clathrin ( 14 , 15 ) . Three types of polygonal coat struc - tures were identified by Pearse and colleagues ( 16 ) . Kanaseki and Kadota ( 17 ) suggested and later Heuser ( 18 ) inferred from an electron micrographic study that modifications in the orga - nization of clathrin in coated pits resulted in their transition to CVs . CVs have been prepared by most investigators by following the method of Pearse ( 14 ) . An important step in the purification was centrifugation in a continuous sucrose gradient that reached 60 % . We now report that exposure of coated vesicles to high sucrose concentrations results in the dissociation of the coat protein from the membrane . The CVs that are recovered when the sucrose is removed may be vesicles that are formed from the mixture of membranes and clathrin present in concentrated sucrose solutions . We have prepared CVs by modifying various steps in the Pearse procedure ( 14 ) and using a ' H20 / 2H20 - 8 % sucrose step gradient instead ofa 20 - 60 % continuous sucrose gradient . This step gradient separates the CVs from other less dense mem - branous structures but does not dissociate them . Higher yields of more homogeneous CVs are obtained in less time than pre - viously found by the Pearse method . In contrast , CVs prepared by using 5 - 60 % sucrose gradients contain a large percent of clathrin baskets , which are presumably formed from dissociated coat protein after removal of sucrose ( 16 , 19 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials . 2 - ( N - Morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid ( Mes ) and EGTA came from Sigma ; analytical grade magnesium chloride , sodium azide , and tetrahydrofuran were from Fisher . Sucrose was from Bethesda Research Laboratories , and 1 , 6 - diphenyl - hexatriene ( DPH ) and Gold Label 2H20 were from Aldrich . Isolation of CVs . A 1 , 600 - g sample of defatted bovine brain was homogenized with an equal volume of0 . 10 M Mes buffer , pH 6 . 5 , containing 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 50 mM MgCl2 , and 3 mM NaN3 ( henceforth referred to as homogenization buffer ) in a Waring blender with three 10 - sec bursts at maximum speed , according to the procedure of Pearse ( 14 ) . The homogenate was centrifuged for 50 min at 20 , 000 x g and the supernatant ( - 2 , 000 ml ) was spun in 24 tubes at 100 , 000 X g ( 34 , 000 rpm in a Beckman 35 rotor ) for 1 hr to obtain a crude vesicle pellet ( = 1 ml ) . The pellet in each tube was suspended in the homog - enization buffer ( = 15 ml per pellet ) by using either a Dounce or a Polytron homogenizer for 5 sec at low speeds . The sus - pension was centrifuged at 10 , 000 x g for 10 min to eliminate aggregated material and the supernatant was centrifuged at 140 , 000 X g ( 37 , 000 rpm in a Beckman 45 Ti rotor ) for 1 hr . The pellet in each tube was suspended in the homogenization buffer ( = 35 ml per pellet ) and the low - speed and high - speed centrif - ugations were repeated . The pellet obtained after the high - speed centrifugation was resuspended in 90 ml of buffer and centrifuged at 10 , 000 X g for 10 min . High - sucrose preparation . About 10 ml of the above super - natant was placed on a discontinuous sucrose gradient of 32 % , 40 % , 48 % , 53 % , and 60 % sucrose ( 28 ml ) . After cooling to SoC solutions were centrifuged for 18 - 20 hr at an average of 75 , 000 x g ( 27 , 000 rpm in a Beckman SW 27 rotor ) . A white band of CVs appearing at 48 - 50 % sucrose was collected , diluted with 3 vol of homogenization buffer , and then centrifuged at 120 , 000 X g ( Beckman 65 rotor ) for 1 hr . The pellet of CVs was sus - pended in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 120 , 000 x g for 1 hr . The pellet was stored in homogenization buffer at 5YC and resuspended when needed . Low - sucrose preparation . Five to six milliliters of superna - tant was layered over 6 - 7 ml of an 8 % sucrose 2H20 solution ( having the same buffer salts as in homogenization buffer ) and centrifuged at about 80 , 000 x g ( 28 , 000 rpm in a Beckman SW 40 or SW 41 rotor ) for 2 hr at 20 ' C . The pellet containing CVs was collected , washed , and resuspended in the homogenization buffer . The suspension was spun at 20 , 000 X g for 10 min to Abbreviations : CV , coated vesicle ; Mes , 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid ; DPH , 1 , 6 - diphenylhexatriene . * Present address : Instituto Di Chimica Biologica , 1st Facolta ' Di Med - icina , Universita Di Napoli , Via Costantinopoli 16 , 80138 Napoli , Italy . t Present address : Department of Pharmacology , University ofStellen - bosch , Faculty of Medicine , P .

USA 79 ( 1982 ) eliminate heavy particulate material and the supernatant was used for further experiments . The pellet could also be stored at 5YC in this condition for several weeks before resuspension and clarification . It should be noted that there is a considerable saving in time and effort in the low - sucrose preparation , principally due to the difference in the number and duration of sucrose gradient cen - trifugations . Pearse sediments the crude CV pellets on three separate sucrose gradients for 2 hr , 16 hr , and 1 hr ( 14 ) . These three steps have been condensed into one sucrose gradient step of 8 % sucrose in 2H20 , which lasts only 2 hr . Pearse mentions that the processing of 100 g of tissue took about 28 hr ( 14 ) . Our time would be closer to 6 - 7 hr for a similar quantity of tissue . From 1 , 600 g of brain processed at a time , we have obtained 5 . 9mg ofprotein [ analysis by the Lowry method ( 20 ) with serum albumin as a standard ] in CVs prepared from 100 g of tissue . Pearse has reported a value of 3 . 1 mg of protein in CVs from 100 g of pig tissue ( 14 ) . In the Pearse preparations , the vesicles were not pure because they contained a significant percentage of baskets ( 16 , 19 ) . Sucrose Density Gradient Analysis . Continuous sucrose density gradients were prepared from either 10 % and 30 % or 10 % and 60 % sucrose solutions in homogenization buffer . Small volumes of 1 mM DPH in tetrahydrofuran was added to the sucrose solutions to give a final DPH concentration of 1 pAM . Sucrose solutions containing DPH were stirred vigorously for 30 - 60 min before the gradients were made . CVs were made in 1 p . M DPH and then incubated for more than an hour before they were layered on the sucrose gradient . Membrane Lipid and Protein Analysis . The presence of pro - tein and membrane lipid in the sucrose gradient fractions was monitored by measuring the fluorescence of tryptophan ( exci - tation , 280 nm ; emission , 340 nm ) and DPH ( excitation 366 nm ; emission , 430 nm ) , respectively . DPH has been used as a flu - orescent label to study the viscosity of membranes of different cell types . We have shown that the fluorescence of DPH in - creases in the presence of CVs or uncoated vesicles but does not change in the presence of protomer clathrin ( 8S ) or clathrin baskets . We are therefore able to distinguish between clathrin baskets , which are devoid ofmembrane , and CVs . The emission at 340 nm monitors all the proteins containing tryptophan . Al - though the quantum yields of proteins vary , the emission in - tensity of a mixture of proteins can serve as an indicator of pro - tein concentration . Sucrose Density Gradients of Mixtures of CVs and Baskets . We have prepared solutions containing a constant concentra - tion of CVs and a variable concentration of baskets - i . e . , 0 % , 10 % , 20 % , and 30 % . These concentrations are based on the protein absorption of both types of macromolecules . The four solutions were sedimented at the same time in the same rotor . The fluorescence was measured on all fractions without chang - ing the settings on the fluorometer for tryptophan or DPH . Consequently , the tryptophan and DPH curves can be com - pared directly with each other . The tryptophan intensity of the sample of CVs without added baskets was set to the same value as the DPH intensity at their peaks . Both sets of points then fell on the same curve in all the fractions except the very low and very high , in which intensities were too small to give much precision . The intensities of tryptophan fluorescence in the three mixtures were then adjusted by the identical factor as in the control solution . In this way any difference in the trypto - phan and DPH curves would represent the contribution of the added baskets to the tryptophan fluorescence curve . Protein Concentration .

RESULTS We first present an analysis of the homogeneity of CV prepa - rations obtained by centrifugation in high - and low - sucrose gra - dients .

USA 79 ( 1982 ) 5883 tryptophan , respectively , indicated that the distribution of the two labels did not represent the behavior of a single sediment - ing species , because the peak of the tryptophan fluorescence was centered about two fractions behind the peak of the DPH fluorescence ( Fig . 1 ) . The greater asymmetry of the tryptophan band and its overlap with the faster - sedimenting DPH band suggest that the tryptophan band is a composite of two protein bands : a faster - sedimenting one that is associated with the DPH band and a slower - sedimenting one that represents protein free of membrane . The faster - sedimenting band therefore reflects the sedimentation behavior of CVs , whereas the slower - sedi - menting band is due to clathrin baskets . We have reported the formation of two sizes of baskets - i . e . , 150S and 300S - by polymerizing clathrin protomer . The baskets in this CV prep - aration should be the 150S size because we have found that CVs have an average sedimentation coefficient of 200 S ( unpublished data ) . The fluorescent profiles of CVs prepared in high sucrose gradients usually reveal a minor shoulder on the less dense side ofthe peak with a larger DPH to tryptophan fluorescence ratio than that of the peak value ( Fig . 1 ) . This shoulder may be due to contamination by CVs that have lost their coat or by other types of membranous material . CVs prepared in a low - sucrose step gradient ( 2H20 - 8 % su - crose ) . The relationship of the fluorescent profiles of the two labels was very different with CVs prepared by this low - sucrose modification . In this case the fluorescence intensities of both labels fit on a single , symmetrical curve ( Fig . 2 ) except for minor deviations on the low - density side of the gradient . It is clear from the close agreement ( i . e . , constant ratio ) of the DPH and tryptophan fluorescent bands that few baskets and very little uncoated vesicle membranes are present . Moreover , the ratio of membrane lipid to protein should be constant in all sedi - menting species of CVs except for those represented by the small DPH shoulder on the low - density side of the gradient . In accord with the symmetrical distribution of fluorescent la - bels we have also found a symmetrical distribution of sedi - mentation coefficients from velocity experiments ( unpublished data ) . The electron micrograph of this preparation of CVs is shown in Fig . 3 . Analysis in 10 - 60 % Gradients . In the preparation of CVs most investigators have followed the original procedure of Pearse and recovered the CV fraction at 50 - 55 % sucrose con - centration . We have now analyzed for memb ~ rane and protein distribution directly in fractions of the 10 - 60 % gradient of CV preparations obtained from both a continuous 10 - 60 % and a step 1H20 / 2H20 - 8 % sucrose gradient . We have not noticed any significant difference in the sedimentation profiles in 10 - 60 % gradients with CVs prepared in either type of gradient . We have observed that the distribution of the two fluorescent labels is completely different in the fractions of the 10 - 60 % gradient when compared with that found in the 10 - 30 % gradient with FIG . 3 . Electron micrograph of coated vesicles ( no . 92 ) prepared in 8 % sucrose / 2H20 step gradient . See Fig . 2 and text for details . ( x70 , 000 . ) Biochemistry : Nandi et d Proc . NatL Acad . Sci . USA 79 ( 1982 ) either type of CV preparation . Whereas in the 10 - 30 % gra - dients , the DPH and tryptophan bands overlapped or were su - perimposable ( depending on the method ofpreparation ) , in the 10 - 60 % gradients the major peaks of the two labels were far apart and the distribution of each label was at least bimodal . The distribution of tryptophan and DPH labels of CVs ( two different 10 - 60 % sucrose preparations ) sedimented for 90 hr and for 18 hr in 10 - 60 % gradients are shown in Figs . 4 and 5 , respectively . The major tryptophan fluorescent bands occur at 47 % sucrose after 18 hr ( Fig . 5 ) and at 55 % after 90 hr ( Fig . 4 ) . The tryptophan peak at 55 % sucrose ( Fig . 4 ) , which is largely free of DPH emission , represents emission from clathrin bas - kets . This was shown by sedimenting a solution of clathrin bas - kets for 90 hr in the same gradient because the peak was found at 55 % sucrose . A major DPH band ( usually the major band ) occurs at - 29 % sucrose concentration after 18 hr and at = 33 % after 90 hr . In the region of these DPH bands the emission originates largely from uncoated vesicles because there is very little tryptophan emission . [ There is frequently a shoulder or minor peak on the low - density side ( i . e . , 24 % sucrose ) of the major DPH peak . ] There is also a second DPH band ( 45 % sucrose at 18 hr , 46 - 48 % at 90 hr ) that overlaps the major tryptophan band . This band presumably represents the CVs that are not dissociated at the high sucrose concentrations used in the gradient . Though the area under this DPH peak varies considerably , it is usually much smaller than the area remaining in the DPH profile . It is evident that only a small percentage of the DPH fluorescence is asso - ciated with CVs in 10 - 60 % sucrose gradients . These CVs may represent a more stable fraction of these organelles . One other feature of these fluorescence patterns needs com - ment . This is a tryptophan peak that occurs at - 34 % sucrose after 18 hr ( Fig . 5 ) and at = 35 % sucrose after 90 hr and that corresponds to the position of 8S clathrin . The height of this peak has varied considerably from one CV preparation to an - other , but it is always much smaller than the major tryptophan band . One can see a small shoulder in fraction 14 ( Fig . 4 ) that may represent 8S clathrin . When native clathrin ( 8S ) and clath - rin baskets were sedimented in 10 - 60 % gradients for 90 hr , tryptophan peaks were observed at 39 % and 53 % , respectively . 60 - y60 40 50 n0 20 30 - ~ ~ ~ ~ 20 3 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 0 C . 2 U , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Q 1U zju OV Fraction FIG . 4 .

It is clear that equilibrium conditions do not prevail for all com - ponents even after 90 hr of sedimentation . Concentrated Sucrose Solutions ofCoated Vesicles . At high rotor speeds , high pressures are generated in centrifugal cells . It is known that high pressures can dissociate proteins into their subunits and unfold globular proteins ( 21 , 22 ) . In order to dis - tinguish between the effects of sucrose and those of pressure ( in sucrose solutions ) on the dissociation of CVs we have brought aqueous solutions ofCVs prepared in ' H20 / 2H20 - 8 % step gra - dient to 15 % , 40 % , and 50 % sucrose . After 2 hr , the 40 % and 50 % sucrose solutions were diluted to 15 % sucrose and all three were sedimented on 15 - 30 % gradients at 27 , 000 rpm for 110 minat 20ยฐC . A single superimposable curve similar to that found in Fig . 2 was found for DPH and tryptophan emission for CVs exposed to 15 % sucrose . For the CVs dissolved in 40 % ( or 50 % ) sucrose solutions , the two labels were displaced from each other and resembled the patterns found when CVs were prepared from 10 - 60 % gradients ( see Fig . 1 ) . Longer periods of exposure to 40 % or 50 % sucrose solutions produced greater separation between the peaks of the DPH and tryptophan emission in 15 - 30 % sucrose gradients . It is clear that the high sucrose con - centration and not the pressure developed in the centrifuge is responsible for the dissociation of CUs into protein and mem - brane . Sucrose Gradient Analysis of Mixtures of CVs and Baskets . From the agreement between the tryptophan and DPH fluo - rescence curves shown in Fig . 2 , we have suggested that this preparation has few baskets . In order to verify the ability of this type of analysis to discriminate between CVs and baskets , we have sedimented on sucrose gradients ( 10 - 30 % ) mixtures of the two types of structures . In Fig . 6 is seen the tryptophan and DPH fluorescence curves of the solution containing 20 % bas - kets . The displacement of the protein curve to lower fractions is clearly evident and resembles results obtained with the Pearse method of preparation of CVs - e . g . , see Fig . 1 . The smallest curve shown in Fig . 6 represents the difference be - tween the tryptophan and DPH curves and reveals the contri - bution to tryptophan fluorescence of the added baskets . In Fig . 7 , difference curves are presented for CV solutions containing 5884 Biochemistry : Nandi et aL Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 79 ( 1982 ) 5885 60 x / 0 10 20 Fraction FIG . 6 .

DISCUSSION Considerable - effort has been expended by numerous investi - gators in purifying and characterizing clathrin since its isolation by Pearse . Although clathrin is usually prepared from CVs , rel - atively few attempts have been made to purify further the CV preparation of Pearse .

Difference curves for mixtures of CVs and 10 % ( o ) , 20 % ( 0 ) , and 30 % ( i ) baskets . See Fig . 6 for further details . the CVs prepared in different laboratories soon revealed that they contained large amounts ofclathrin baskets ( 16 , 19 ) . Wood - ward and Roth ( 23 ) observed a broad , unsymmetrical size dis - tribution of CVs sedimented in a 10 - 30 % sucrose gradient when they measured the protein content by . absorbance at 280 nm . Recently , Rubenstein et aL ( 24 ) resolved a CV preparation into coated and smooth vesicles and showed that the ATPase activity of the preparation was associated with the smooth vesicles . We have characterized CV preparations by evaluating both the pro - tein and membrane lipid composition . If protein is present without membrane , as in clathrin baskets , it should be imme - diately evident ( Figs . 6 and 7 ) . Ifmembrane fragments are pres - ent with little or no protein , it will be clear from the fluores - cence ratio of the two probes . We have been able to demonstrate by using this method that sedimentation in 10 - 60 % sucrose gradients for 18 hr results in extensive dissociation of CVs into their lipid and protein com - ponents . Moreover , these components associate to reform CVs when sucrose is removed because sedimentation on nondisso - ciating 10 - 30 % sucrose gradients reveals only two species - i . e . , CVs and 150S baskets . It appears therefore that CVs obtained from 10 - 60 % gradients . are largely composed of reconstituted vesicles . It - remains to be shown that these preparations of CVs have the same properties as native CVs . We have fractionated CVs in a single step gradient - i . e . , 1H20 vs . 2H20 - 8 % sucrose , which avoids the dissociating con - ditions of high sucrose concentrations . This step should prevent vesicles of higher lipid content than CVs from entering the 2H20 - 8 % sucrose layer . It should be noted that the lipid content of CVs is very low for a membrane vesicle because about half of the total protein present in CVs is clathrin coat . Pearse has recently mentioned the deleterious effect of high sucrose con - centration and changed to a 2H20 / Ficoll gradient in preparing coated vesicles ( 8 ) . 1 . Roth , T . F . & Porter , K .
