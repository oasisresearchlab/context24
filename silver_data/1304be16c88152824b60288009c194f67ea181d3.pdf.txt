These power - laws hold for three snapshots of the Internet , between November 1997 and December 1998 , de - spite a 45 % growth of its size during that period . We show that our power - laws (cid:12)t the real data very well resulting in correlation coe(cid:14)cients of 96 % or higher . Our observations provide a novel perspective of the struc - ture of the Internet . The power - laws describe concisely skewed distributions of graph properties such as the node outdegree . In addition , these power - laws can be used to estimate important parameters such as the average neigh - borhood size , and facilitate the design and the performance analysis of protocols . Furthermore , we can use them to gen - erate and select realistic topologies for simulation purposes . 1 Introduction \ What does the Internet look like ? " \ Are there any topolog - ical properties that don ' t change in time ? " \ How will it look like a year from now ? " \ How can I generate Internet - like graphs for my simulations ? " These are some of the questions motivating this work . In this paper , we study the topology of the Internet and we identify several power - laws . Furthermore , we discuss multiple bene(cid:12)ts from understanding the topology of the Internet . First , we can design more e(cid:14)cient protocols that take advantage of its topological properties . Second , we can create more accurate arti(cid:12)cial models for simulation pur - poses . And third , we can derive estimates for topological parameters ( e . g . the average number of neighbors within h (cid:3) This research was partially funded by the National Science Foun - dation under Grants No .

Modeling the Internet topology 1 is an important open problem despite the attention it has attracted recently . Pax - son and Floyd consider this problem as a major reason \ Why We Don ' t Know How To Simulate The Internet " [ 16 ] . Sev - eral graph - generator models have been proposed [ 23 ] [ 5 ] [ 27 ] , but the problem of creating realistic topologies is not yet solved ; the selection of several parameter values are left to the intuition and the experience of each researcher . As our primary contribution , we identify three power - laws for the topology of the Internet over the duration of a year in 1998 . Power - laws are expressions of the form y / x a , where a is a constant , x and y are the measures of interest , and / stands for \ proportional to " . Some of those exponents do not change signi(cid:12)cantly over time , while some exponents change by approximately 10 % . However , the important ob - servation is the existence of power - laws , i . e . , the fact that there is some exponent for each graph instance . During 1998 , these power - laws hold in three Internet instances with good linear (cid:12)ts in log - log plots ; the correlation coe(cid:14)cient of the (cid:12)t is at least 96 % and usually higher than 98 % . In ad - dition , we introduce a graph metric to quantify the density of a graph and propose a rough power - law approximation of that metric . Furthermore , we show how to use our power - laws and our approximation to estimate useful parameters of the Internet , such as the average number of neighbors within h hops . Finally , we focus on the generation of real - istic graphs . Our power - laws can help verify the realism of synthetic topologies . In addition , we measure several crucial parameters for the most recent graph generator [ 27 ] . Our work in perspective . Our work is based on three In - ternet instances over a one - year period . During this time , the size of the network increased substantially ( 45 % ) . De - spite this , the sample space is rather limited , and mak - ing any generalizations would be premature until additional studies are conducted . However , the authors believe that these power - laws characterize the dynamic equilibrium of the Internet growth in the same way power - laws appear to describe various natural networks such as the the human respiratory system [ 12 ] , and automobile networks [ 6 ] . At a more practical level , the regularities characterize the topol - ogy concisely during 1998 . If this time period turns out to be a transition phase for the Internet , our observations will obviously be valid only for 1998 . In absence of revolutionary 1 In this paper , we use the expression \ the topology of the Inter - net " , althoughthe topology changesand it would bemore accurateto talk about \ Internet topologies " . We hope that this does not mislead or confuse the reader . changes , it is reasonable to expect that our power - laws will continue to hold in the future . The rest of this paper is structured as follows . In Sec - tion 2 , we present some de(cid:12)nitions and previous work on measurements and models for the Internet . In Section 3 , we present our Internet instances and provide useful measure - ments . In Section 4 , we present our three observed power - laws and our power - law approximation . In Section 5 , we explain the intuition behind our power - laws , discuss their use , and show how we can use them to predict the growth of the Internet . In Section 6 , we conclude our work and discuss future directions . 2 Background and Previous Work The Internet can be decomposed into connected subnet - works that are under separate administrative authorities , as shown in Figure 1 . These subnetworks are called do - mains or autonomous systems 2 . This way , the topology of the Internet can be studied at two di(cid:11)erent granularities . At the router level , we represent each router by a node [ 14 ] . At the inter - domain level , each domain is represented by a single node [ 10 ] and each edge is an inter - domain inter - connection . The study of the topology at both levels is equally important . The Internet community develops and employs di(cid:11)erent protocols inside a domain and between domains . An intra - domain protocol is limited within a do - main , while an inter - domain protocol runs between domains treating each domain as one entity . Symbol De(cid:12)nition G An undirected graph . N Number of nodes in a graph . E Number of edges in a graph . (cid:14) The diameter of the graph . dv Outdegree of node v . (cid:22) d The average outdegree of the nodes of a graph : (cid:22) d = 2 E = N Table 1 : De(cid:12)nitions and symbols . Metrics . The metrics that have been used so far to de - scribe graphs are mainly the node outdegree , and the dis - tances between nodes . Given a graph , the outdegree of a node is de(cid:12)ned as the number of edges incident to the node ( see Table 1 ) . The distance between two nodes is the num - ber of edges of the shortest path between the two nodes . Most studies report minimum , maximum , and average val - ues and plot the outdegree and distance distribution . We denote the number of nodes of a graph by N , the number of edges by E , and the diameter of the graph by (cid:14) . Real network studies . Govindan and Reddy [ 10 ] study the growth of the inter - domain topology of the Internet be - tween 1994 and 1995 . The graph is sparse with 75 % of the nodes having outdegrees less or equal to two . They distin - guish four groups of nodes according to their outdegree . The authors observe an increase in the connectivity over time . Pansiot and Grad [ 14 ] study the topology of the Internet in 2 Thede(cid:12)nitionofanautonomoussystemcanvaryintheliterature , but it usually coincides with that of the domain [ 10 ] . 1995 at the router level . The distances they report are ap - proximately two times larger compared to those of Govindan and Reddy . This leads to the interesting observation that , on average , one hop at the inter - domain level corresponded to two hops at the router level in 1995 . Generating Internet Models . Regarding the creation of realistic graphs , Waxman introduced what seems to be one of the most popular network models [ 23 ] . These graphs are created probabilistically considering the distance between nodes in a Euclidean sense . This model was successful in representing small early networks such as the ARPANET . As the size and the complexity of the network increased more detailed models were needed [ 5 ] [ 27 ] . In the most re - cent work , Zegura et al . [ 27 ] introduce a comprehensive model that includes several previous models 3 . They call their model transit - stub , which combines simple topologies ( e . g . Waxman graphs and trees ) in a hierarchical structure . There are several parameters that control the structure of the graph . For example , parameters de(cid:12)ne the total num - ber and the size of the stubs . An advantage of this model lies in its ability to describe a number of topologies . At the same time , a researcher needs experimental estimates to set values to the parameters of the model . Power - laws in communication networks . Power - laws have been used to describe the tra(cid:14)c in communications net - works , but not their topology . Actually , both self - similarity , and heavy tails appear in network tra(cid:14)c and are both re - lated to power - laws . A variable X follows a heavy tail distri - bution if P [ X > x ] = k a x (cid:0)a L ( x ) , where k 2 < + and L ( x ) is a slowly varying function : limt ! 1 [ L ( tx ) = L ( x ) ] = 1 [ 20 ] [ 24 ] . A Pareto distribution is a special case of a heavy tail dis - tribution with P [ X > x ] = k a x (cid:0)a . It is easy to see that power - laws , Pareto and heavy - tailed distributions are inti - mately related . In a pioneering work , Leland et al . [ 11 ] show the self - similar nature of Local Area Network ( LAN ) tra(cid:14)c . Second , Paxson and Floyd [ 15 ] provide evidence of self simi - larity in Wide Area Network ( WAN ) tra(cid:14)c . In modeling the tra(cid:14)c , Willinger et al . [ 25 ] provide structural models that describe LAN tra(cid:14)c as a collective e(cid:11)ect of simple heavy - tailed ON - OFF sources . Finally , Willinger et al . [ 24 ] bring all of the above together by describing LAN and WAN tra(cid:14)c through structural models and showing the relation of the self - similarity at the macroscopic level of WANs with the heavy - tailed behavior at the microscopic level of individual sources . In addition , Crovella and Bestavros use power - laws to describe tra(cid:14)c patterns in the World Wide Web [ 3 ] . At an intuitive level , the previous works seem to attribute the heavy - tailed behavior of the tra(cid:14)c to the heavy - tailed dis - tribution of the size of the transmitted data (cid:12)les , and to the heavy - tailed characteristics of the human - computer interac - tion . Recently , Chuang and Sirbu [ 2 ] use a power - law to estimate the size of multicast distribution trees . Note that in a follow - up work , Philips et al . [ 17 ] verify the reason - able accuracy of the Chuang - Sirbu scaling law for practical purposes , but they also propose an estimate that does not follow a power - law . 3 Internet Instances In this section , we present the Internet instances we ac - quired and we study their evolution in time . We examine the inter - domain topology of the Internet from the end of 1997 until the end of 1998 . We use three real graphs that correspond to six - month intervals approximately .

The information is collected by a route server from BGP 4 routing tables of multiple geographically distributed routers with BGP connections to the server . We list the three datasets that we use in our paper , and we present more information in Appendix A .

(cid:15) Int - 04 - 98 : the inter - domain topology of the Internet in April of 1998 with 3530 nodes , 6432 edges , and 3 : 65 avg . outdegree . (cid:15) Int - 12 - 98 : the inter - domain topology of the Internet in December of 1998 with 4389 nodes , 8256 edges , and 3 : 76 avg . outdegree . Note that the growth of the Internet in the time pe - riod we study is 45 % ( see Figure 2 ) . The change is signif - icant , and it ensures that the three graphs re(cid:13)ect di(cid:11)erent instances of an evolving network . Although we focus on the Internet topology at the inter - domain level , we also examine an instance at the router 4 BGP stands for the Border Gateway Protocol [ 19 ] , and it is the inter - domain routing protocol . level . The graph represents the topology of the routers of the Internet in 1995 , and was tediously collected by Pansiot and Grad [ 14 ] . (cid:15) Rout - 95 : the routers of the Internet in 1995 with 3888 nodes , 5012 edges , and an average outdegree of 2 . 57 . Clearly , the above graph is considerably di(cid:11)erent from the (cid:12)rst three graphs . First of all , the graphs model the topology at di(cid:11)erent levels . Second , the Rout - 95 graph comes from a di(cid:11)erent time period , in which Internet was in a fairly early phase . To facilitate the graph generation procedures , we ana - lyze the Internet in a way that suits the graph generator models [ 27 ] . Namely , we decompose each graph in two com - ponents : the tree component that contains all nodes that belong exclusively to trees and the core component that con - tains the rest of the nodes including the roots of the trees . We report several interesting measurements in Appendix A . For example , we (cid:12)nd that 40 - 50 % of the nodes belong to trees . Also , 80 % the trees have a depth of one , while the maximum tree depth is three . 4 Power - Laws of the Internet In this section , we observe three of power - laws of the In - ternet topology . Namely , we propose and measure graph properties , which demonstrate a regularity that is unlikely to be a coincidence . The exponents of the power - laws can be used to characterize graphs . In addition , we introduce a graph metric that is tailored to the needs of the complexity analysis of protocols . The metric re(cid:13)ects the density or the connectivity of nodes , and we o(cid:11)er a rough approximation of its value through a power - law . Finally , using our ob - servations and metrics , we identify a number of interesting relationships between important graph parameters . In our work , we want to (cid:12)nd metrics or properties that quantifytopological properties and describe concisely skewed data distributions . Previous metrics , such as the average outdegree , fail to do so . First , metrics that are based on minimum , maximum and average values are not good de - scriptors of skewed distributions ; they miss a lot of infor - mation and probably the \ interesting " part that we would want to capture . Second , the plots of the previous metrics are di(cid:14)cult to quantify , and this makes di(cid:14)cult the com - parison of graphs . Ideally , we want to describe a plot or a distribution with one number . Symbol De(cid:12)nition fd The frequency of an outdegree , d , is the num - ber of nodes with outdegree d . rv The rank of a node , v , is its index in the order of decreasing outdegree . P ( h ) The number of pairs of nodes is the total num - ber of pairs of nodes within less or equal to h hops , including self - pairs , and counting all other pairs twice . NN ( h ) The average number of nodes in a neighbor - hood of h hops . (cid:21) The eigen value of a square matrix A : 9x 2 R N and Ax = (cid:21)x . i The order of (cid:21)i in (cid:21)1 (cid:21) (cid:21)2 : : : (cid:21) (cid:21)N Table 2 : Novel de(cid:12)nitions and their symbols . To express our power - laws , we introduce several graph metrics that we show in Table 2 . We de(cid:12)ne frequency , fd , of some outdegree , d , to be the number of nodes that have this outdegree . If we sort the nodes in decreasing outdegree sequence , we de(cid:12)ne rank , rv , to be the index of the node in the sequence , while ties in sorting are broken arbitrarily . We de(cid:12)ne the number of pairs of nodes P ( h ) to be the total number of pairs of nodes within less or equal to h hops , including self - pairs , and counting all other pairs twice . The use of this metric will become apparent later . We also de(cid:12)ne NN ( h ) to be the average number of nodes in a neighborhood of h hops . Finally , we recall the de(cid:12)nition of the eigenvalues of a graph , which are the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix . In this section , we use linear regression to (cid:12)t a line in a set of two - dimensional points [ 18 ] . The technique is based on the least - square errors method . The validity of the ap - proximation is indicated by the correlation coe(cid:14)cient which is a number between (cid:0)1 : 0 and 1 : 0 . For the rest of this paper , we use the absolute value of the correlation coe(cid:14)cient , ACC . An ACC value of 1 : 0 indicates perfect linear correlation , i . e . , the data points are exactly on a line . 4 . 1 The rank exponent R In this section , we study the outdegrees of the nodes . We sort the nodes in decreasing order of outdegree , dv , and plot the ( rv ; dv ) pairs in log - log scale . The results are shown in Figures 3 and 4 . The measured data is represented by diamonds , while the solid line represents the least - squares approximation . A striking observation is that the plots are approximated well by the linear regression . The correlation coe(cid:14)cient is higher than 0 : 974 for the inter - domain graphs and 0 : 948 for the Rout - 95 graph . This leads us to the following power - law and de(cid:12)nition . Power - Law 1 ( rank exponent ) The outdegree , dv , of a node v , is proportional to the rank of the node , rv , to the power of a constant , R : dv / r R v De(cid:12)nition 1 Let us sort the nodes of a graph in decreasing order of outdegree . We de(cid:12)ne the rank exponent , R , to be the slope of the plot of the outdegrees of the nodes versus the rank of the nodes in log - log scale . For the three inter - domain instances , the rank exponent , R , is (cid:0)0 : 81 , (cid:0)0 : 82 and (cid:0)0 : 74 in chronological order as we see in AppendixB . The rank exponentof the Rout - 95 graph , (cid:0)0 : 48 , is di(cid:11)erent compared to that of the (cid:12)rst three graphs . This is something that we expected , given the di(cid:11)erences in the nature of the graphs . On the other hand , this di(cid:11)erence suggests that the rank exponent can distinguish graphs of di(cid:11)erent nature , although they both follow Power - Law 1 . This property can make the rank exponent a powerful metric for characterizing families of graphs , see Section 5 . Intuitively , Power - Law 1 most likely re(cid:13)ects a principle of the way domains connect ; the linear property observed in our four graph instances is unlikely to be a coincidence . The power - law seems to capture the equilibrium of the trade - o(cid:11) between the gain and the cost of adding an edge from a (cid:12)nancial and functional point of view , as we discuss in Section 5 . Extended Discussion - Applications . We can esti - mate the proportionality constant for Power - Law 1 , if we require that the minimum outdegree of the graph is one ( dN = 1 ) . This way , we can re(cid:12)ne the power - law as follows . Lemma 1 The outdegree , dv , of a node v , is a function of the rank of the node , rv and the rank exponent , R , as follows dv = 1 N R r R v Proof . The proof can be found in Appendix C . Finally , using lemma 1 , we relate the number of edges with the number of nodes and the rank exponent . Lemma 2 The number of edges , E , of a graph can be es - timated as a function of the number of nodes , N , and the rank exponent , R , as follows : E = 1 2 ( R + 1 ) ( 1 (cid:0) 1 N R + 1 ) N Proof . The proof can be found in Appendix C . Note that Lemma 2 can give us the number of edges as a function of the number of nodes for a given rank expo - nent . We tried the lemma in our datasets and the estimated number of edges di(cid:11)ered by 9 % to 20 % from the actual num - ber of edges . More speci(cid:12)cally for the Int - 12 - 98 , the lemma underestimates the number of edges by 10 % . We can get a closer estimate ( 3 . 6 % ) by using a simple linear interpola - tion in the number of edges given the number of nodes . Note that the two prediction mechanisms are di(cid:11)erent : our lemma does not need previous network instances , but it needs to know the rank exponent . However , given previous network instances , we seem to be better o(cid:11) using the linear inter - polation according to the above analysis . We examined the sensitivity of our lemma with respect to the value of rank exponent . A 5 % increase ( decrease ) in the absolute value of the rank exponent increases ( decreases ) the number of edges by 10 % for the number of nodes in Int - 12 - 98 . 4 . 2 The outdegree exponent O In this section , we study the distribution of the outdegree of the graphs , and we manage to describe it concisely by a single number . Recall that the frequency , fd , of an outde - gree , d , is the number of nodes with outdegree d . We plot the frequency fd versus the outdegree d in log - log scale in 0 . 1 1 10 100 1000 1 10 100 1000 10000 " 971108 . rank " exp ( 6 . 34763 ) * x * * ( - 0 . 811392 ) 0 . 1 1 10 100 1000 1 10 100 1000 10000 " 980410 . rank " exp ( 6 . 62082 ) * x * * ( - 0 . 821274 ) ( a ) Int - 11 - 97 ( b ) Int - 04 - 98 Figure 3 : The rank plots .

In these plots , we exclude a small percent - age of nodes of higher outdegree that have frequency of one . Speci(cid:12)cally , we plot the outdegrees starting from one until we reach an outdegree that has frequency of one . As we saw earlier , the higher outdegrees are described and captured by the rank exponent . In any case , we plot more than 98 % of the total number of nodes . The solid lines are the result of the linear regression . The major observation is that the plots are approxi - mately linear ( see Table 8 ) . The correlation coe(cid:14)cients are between 0 . 968 - 0 . 99 for the inter - domain graphs and 0 . 966 for the Rout - 95 . This leads us to the following power - law and de(cid:12)nition . Power - Law 2 ( outdegree exponent ) The frequency , fd , of an outdegree , d , is proportional to the outdegree to the power of a constant , O : fd / d O De(cid:12)nition 2 We de(cid:12)ne the outdegree exponent , O , to be the slope of the plot of the frequency of the outdegrees versus the outdegrees in log - log scale . The second striking observation is that the value of the outdegree exponent is practically constant in our graphs of the inter - domain topology . The exponents are (cid:0)2 : 15 , (cid:0)2 : 16 and (cid:0)2 : 2 , as shown in Appendix B . It is interesting to note that even the Rout - 95 graph obeys the same power - law ( Fig - ure 6 . b ) with an outdegree exponent of (cid:0)2 : 48 . These facts suggest that Power - Law 2 describes a fundamental property of the network . The intuition behind this power - law is that the distri - bution of the outdegree of Internet nodes is not arbitrary . The qualitative observation is that lower degrees are more frequent . Our power - law manages to quantify this observa - tion by a single number , the outdegree exponent . This way , we can test the realism of a graph with a simple numeri - cal comparison . If a graph does not follow Power - Law 2 , or if its outdegree exponent is considerably di(cid:11)erent from the real exponents , it probably does not represent a realistic topology . 4 . 3 The hop - plot exponent H In this section , we quantify the connectivity and distances between the Internet nodes in a novel way . We choose to 1 10 100 1000 10000 1 10 100 " 971108 . out " exp ( 7 . 68585 ) * x * * ( - 2 . 15632 ) 1 10 100 1000 10000 1 10 100 " 980410 . out " exp ( 7 . 89793 ) * x * * ( - 2 . 16356 ) ( a ) Int - 11 - 97 ( b ) Int - 04 - 98 Figure 5 : The outdegree plots : Log - log plot of frequency fd versus the outdegree d . 1 10 100 1000 10000 1 10 100 " 981205 . out " exp ( 8 . 11393 ) * x * * ( - 2 . 20288 ) 1 10 100 1000 10000 1 10 100 " routes . out " exp ( 8 . 52124 ) * x * * ( - 2 . 48626 ) ( a ) Int - 12 - 98 ( b ) Rout - 95 Figure 6 : The outdegree plots : Log - log plot of frequency fd versus the outdegree d . study the size of the neighborhood within some distance , instead of the distance itself . Namely , we use the total num - ber of pairs of nodes P ( h ) within h hops , which we de(cid:12)ne as the total number of pairs of nodes within less or equal to h hops , including self - pairs , and counting all other pairs twice . Let us see the intuition behind the number of pairs of nodes P ( h ) . For h = 0 , we only have the self - pairs : P ( 0 ) = N . For the diameter of the graph (cid:14) , h = (cid:14) , we have the self - pairs plus all the other possible pairs : P ( (cid:14) ) = N 2 , which is the maximum possible number of pairs . For a hypothetical ring topology , we have P ( h ) / h 1 , and , for a 2 - dimensional grid , we have P ( h ) / h 2 , for h (cid:28) (cid:14) . We examine whether the number of pairs P ( h ) for the Internet follows a similar power - law . In (cid:12)gures 7 and 8 , we plot the number of pairs P ( h ) as a function of the number of hops h in log - log scale . The data is represented by diamonds , and the dotted horizontal line represents the maximum number of pairs , which is N 2 . We want to describe the plot by a line in least - squares (cid:12)t , for h (cid:28) (cid:14) , shown as a solid line in the plots . We approximate the (cid:12)rst 4 hops in the inter - domain graphs , and the (cid:12)rst 12 hops in the Rout - 95 . The correlation coe(cid:14)cients are is 0 : 98 for inter - domain graphs and 0 : 96 , for the Rout - 95 , as we see in Appendix B . Unfortunately , four points is a rather small number to verify or disprove a linearity hypothesis ex - perimentally . However , even this rough approximation has several useful applications as we show later in this section . Approximation 1 ( hop - plot exponent ) The to - tal number of pairs of nodes , P ( h ) , within h hops , is proportional to the number of hops to the power of a constant , H : P ( h ) / h H ; h (cid:28) (cid:14) De(cid:12)nition 3 Let us plot the number of pairs of nodes , P ( h ) , within h hops versus the number of hops in log - log scale . For h (cid:28) (cid:14) , we de(cid:12)ne the slope of this plot to be the hop - plot exponent , H . Observe that the three inter - domain datasets have prac - tically equal hop - plot exponents ; 4 : 6 ; 4 : 7 , and 4 : 86 in chrono - logical order , as we see in Appendix B . This shows that the hop - plot exponent describes an aspect of the connectivity of the graph in a single number .

The hop - plot exponent of Rout - 95 is 2 : 8 , which is much di(cid:11)erent compared to those of the inter - domain graphs . This is expected , since the Rout - 95 is a sparser graph . Recall that for a ring topology , we have H = 1 , and , for a 2 - dimensional grid , we have H = 2 . The above observations suggest that the hop - plot exponent can distinguish families of graphs e(cid:14)ciently , and thus , it is a good metric for characterizing the topology . Extended Discussion - Applications . We can re(cid:12)ne Approximation 1 by calculating its proportionality constant . Let us recall the de(cid:12)nition of the number of pairs , P ( h ) . For h = 1 , we consider each edge twice and we have the self - pairs , therefore : P ( 1 ) = N + 2 E . We demand that Approximation 1 satis(cid:12)es the previous equation as an initial condition . Lemma 3 The number of pairs within h hops is P ( h ) = (cid:26) c h H ; h (cid:28) (cid:14) N 2 ; h (cid:21) (cid:14) where c = N + 2 E to satisfy initial conditions . In networks , we often need to reach a target without knowing its exact position [ 7 ] [ 1 ] . In these cases , selecting the extent of our broadcast or search is an issue . On the one hand , a small broadcast will not reach our target . On the other hand , an extended broadcast creates too many messages and takes a long time to complete . Ideally , we want to know how many hops are required to reach a \ su(cid:14)ciently large " part of the network . In our hop - plots , a promising solution is the intersection of the two asymptote lines : the horizontal one at level N 2 and the asymptote with slope H . We calculate the intersection point using Lemma 3 , and we de(cid:12)ne : De(cid:12)nition 4 ( e(cid:11)ective diameter ) Given a graph with N nodes , E edges , and H hop - plot exponent , we de(cid:12)ne the ef - fective diameter , (cid:14)ef , as : (cid:14)ef = (cid:18) N 2 N + 2 E (cid:19) 1 = H Intuitively , the e(cid:11)ective diameter can be understood as follows : any two nodes are within (cid:14)ef hops from each other with high probability . We veri(cid:12)ed the above statement ex - perimentally .

The ceiling of the e(cid:11)ective diameter is (cid:12)ve , which covers more than 95 % of the pairs of nodes . An advantage of the e(cid:11)ective diameter is that it can be calculated easily , when we know N , and H . Recall that we can calculate the number of edges from Lemma 2 . Given that the hop - plot exponent is practically constant , we can estimate the e(cid:11)ective diameter of future Internet instances as we do in Section 5 . Furthermore , we can estimate the average size of the neighborhood , NN ( h ) , within h hops using the number of pairs P ( h ) . Recall that P ( h ) (cid:0) N is the number of pairs without the self - pairs . NN ( h ) = P ( h ) N (cid:0) 1 ( 1 ) Using Equation 1 and Lemma 3 , we can estimate the average neighborhood size . Lemma 4 The average size of the neighborhood , NN ( h ) , within h hops as a function of the hop - plot exponent , H , for h (cid:28) (cid:14) , is NN ( h ) = c N h H (cid:0)1 where c = N + 2 E to satisfy initial conditions . The average neighborhood is a commonly used parame - ter in the performance of network protocols . Our estimate is an improvement over the commonly used estimate that uses the average outdegree [ 26 ] [ 7 ] which we call average - outdegree estimate : NN 0 ( h ) = (cid:22) d ( (cid:22) d(cid:0) 1 ) h(cid:0)1 In (cid:12)gure 9 , we plot the actual and both estimates of the average neighborhood size versus the number of hops for the Int - 12 - 98 graph . In Table 3 , we show the normalized error of each estimate : we calculate the quantity : ( p(cid:0)r ) = r where p the prediction and r the real value . The results for the other inter - domain graphs are similar . The superiority of the hop - plot exponent estimate is apparent compared to the average - outdegree estimate . The discrepancy of the average - outdegree estimate can be explained if we consider that the estimate does not comply with the real data ; it implicitly assumes that the outdegree distribution is uniform . In more detail , it assumes that each node in the periphery of the neighborhood adds (cid:22) d (cid:0) 1 new nodes at the next hop . Our data shows that the outdegree distribution is highly skewed , which explains why the use of the hop - plot estimate gives a better approximation . The most interesting di(cid:11)erence between the two esti - mates is qualitative . The previous estimate considers the neighborhood size exponential in the number of hops . Our estimate considers the neighborhood as an H - dimensional sphere with radius equal to the number of hops , which is a novel way to look at the topology of a network 5 . Our data suggests that the hop - plot exponent - based estimate gives a closer approximation compared to the average - outdegree - based metric . 4 . 4 The eigen exponent E In this section , we identify properties of the eigenvalues of our Internet graphs . There is a rich literature that proves that the eigenvalues of a graph are closely related to many basic topological properties such as the diameter , the num - ber of edges , the number of spanning trees , the number of connected components , and the number of walks of a certain length between vertices , as we can see in [ 8 ] and [ 4 ] . All of the above suggest that the eigenvalues intimately relate to topological properties of graphs . We plot the eigenvalue (cid:21)i versus i in log - log scale for the (cid:12)rst 20 eigenvalues . Recall that i is the order of (cid:21)i in the decreasing sequence of eigenvalues . The results are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11 . The eigenvalues are shown as dia - monds in the (cid:12)gures , and the solid lines are approximations using a least - squares (cid:12)t . Observe that in all graphs , the plots are practically lin - ear with a correlation coe(cid:14)cient of 0 : 99 , as we see in Ap - pendix B . It is rather unlikely that such a canonical form of the eigenvalues is purely coincidental , and we therefore conjecture that it constitutes an empirical power - law of the Internet topology . Power - Law 3 ( eigen exponent ) The eigenvalues , (cid:21)i , of a graph are proportional to the order , i , to the power of a constant , E : (cid:21)i / i E De(cid:12)nition 5 We de(cid:12)ne the eigen exponent , E , to be the slope of the plot of the sorted eigenvalues versus their order in log - log scale . 5 Note that our results focus on relatively small neighborhoods compared to the diameter h (cid:28) (cid:14) . Other experimental studies focus on neighborhoods of larger radius [ 17 ] . 1 10 100 1 10 " 971108 . internet . svals " exp ( 3 . 57926 ) * x * * ( - 0 . 471327 ) 1 10 100 1 10 " 980410 . svals " exp ( 3 . 69981 ) * x * * ( - 0 . 502062 ) ( a ) Int - 11 - 97 ( b ) Int - 04 - 98 Figure 10 : The eigenvalue plots : Log - log plot of eigenvalues in decreasing order . 1 10 100 1 10 " 981205 . svals " exp ( 3 . 77292 ) * x * * ( - 0 . 486946 ) 1 10 1 10 " routes . svals " exp ( 2 . 24579 ) * x * * ( - 0 . 17742 ) ( a ) Int - 12 - 98 ( b ) Rout - 95 Figure 11 : The eigenvalue plots : Log - log plot of eigenvalues in decreasing order . A surprising observation is that the eigen exponents of the three inter - domain graphs are practically equal : (cid:0)0 : 47 , (cid:0)0 : 50 and (cid:0)0 : 48 in chronological order . This means that the eigen exponent captures a property of the Internet that characterizes all three instances despite the increase in size . On the other hand , theeigen exponentof the routers graph is signi(cid:12)cantly di(cid:11)erent (cid:0)0 : 177 , from the previous slopes . This shows that the eigen exponent can distinguish di(cid:11)erences between families of graphs . 5 Discussion In this section , we discuss the practical uses of our power - laws and our approximation . We also present the intuition behind the existence of such power - laws in a chaotic envi - ronment such as the Internet . In addition , we discuss the scope of the predictions that are based on our work . Describing Graphs : Exponents versus Averages . We pro - pose a new way to describe topological properties using power - laws . Our observations show that most of the distri - butions of interest are skewed , typically following a power - law . Average values falsely imply a uniform distribution , and they can be misleading . For example , 85 % of the nodes in Int - 12 - 98 have outdegree less than the average outdegree ! We propose to use the exponents of power - laws , which man - age to capture the trend of a property in a single number . Protocol Performance . Our work can facilitate the de - sign , and the performance analysis of protocols . As we saw , our power - laws help us estimate useful graph metrics . We provide formulas for the e(cid:11)ective diameter , the average neighborhood size , and the number of edges , in De(cid:12)nition 4 , Lemma 4 and Lemma 2 respectively . Our O ( (cid:22) d h H ) es - timate for the average neighborhood size is a fundamental improvement over the commonly used O ( (cid:22) d h ) . This way , we can (cid:12)ne - tune and analyze the performance and the complex - ity of several protocols 6 . Predictions and Extrapolations . Our power - laws o(cid:11)er guidelines for answering \ what - if " questions . First , we can scrutinize the plausibility of a hypothesis , if they contradict our power - laws . Second , we can predict useful parameters of the Internet under di(cid:11)erent hypotheses and assumptions . Actually , given just a hypothesis for the number of nodes , we can estimate the number of edges from Lemma 2 , and 6 Some protocols that employ broadcasting or (cid:13)ooding techniques are thelink - stateprotocolsOSPFandMOSPF [ 13 ] , and themulticast protocols DVMRP [ 22 ] , QoSMIC [ 7 ] , YAM [ 1 ] .

Note that our tools do not predict the number of nodes of the Internet , but for the sake of the example we will examine two possible growth patterns . We can assume that the number of nodes increases a ) linearly , or b ) by 1 : 45 each year . The results our shown in Table 4 for the linear growth and Table 5 for the 1 : 45 growth . Given the number of nodes , we calculate the num - ber of edges using Lemma 2 with rank exponent of (cid:0)0 : 81 , which is the median of the three observed rank exponents . We calculate the e(cid:11)ective diameter using De(cid:12)nition 4 with a hop - plot exponent of 4 : 71 , the median of the observed values . Predicting the evolution of a dynamic system such as the Internet is not trivial . There are many social , economi - cal , and technological factors that can alter signi(cid:12)cantly the topology of the network . Furthermore , systems often evolve in bursts following social and technological breakthroughs . In this paper , we claim that our power - laws characterize the Internet topology during the year 1998 . However , given the large numberof natural distributions that follow power - laws , the Internet topology will likely be described by power - laws even in the future . In the absence of any other information , a practitioner would reasonably conjecture that our power - laws might continue to hold , at least for the near future . We elaborate further on our intuition regarding power - laws and natural systems in section 5 . 1 . Graph Generation and Selection . Our power - laws can be used to characterize graph topologies . This way , the power - laws can be used as a composite \ qualifying exam " for the realism of a graph . Recall that some power - laws showed sig - ni(cid:12)cantly di(cid:11)erent exponents in the inter - domain and the router - level graphs . We conducted some preliminary exper - iments with some arti(cid:12)cial topologies and some real graphs of di(cid:11)erent nature ( e . g . web - site topology ) . Some graphs did not comply to the power - laws at all , while some oth - ers showed large di(cid:11)erences in the values of the exponents . The observations for these graphs and the Internet graphs in this paper suggest that our power - laws could be used to characterize and distinguish graphs . In addition , we provide measurements that are targeted towards the current graph models [ 27 ] , as we saw in Sec - tion 3 and Appendix A . In an overview , we list the follow - ing guidelines for creating inter - domain topologies . First , a large but decreasing percentage of the nodes ( 50 % , 45 % , and 40 % ) belong to trees . Second , more than 80 % of the trees have depth one , and the maximum depth is three . Third , the outdegree distribution is skewed following our power - laws 1 and 2 within a range of 1 to 1000 approximately . As a (cid:12)nal step , the realism of the resulting graph can be tested using our power - laws . 5 . 1 Finding Order in Chaos Why would such an unruly entity like the Internet follow any statistical regularities ? Note that the high correlation coe(cid:14)cients exclude the role of coincidence . Intrigued by the previous question , we attempt an intuitive explanation . The topological structure of the Internet is the collective result of many small forces in antagonistic and cooperative rela - tionships . These forces (cid:12)nd an equilibrium in a state , and it is this state that our power - laws capture . Let us think of how change happens . New nodes are not just \ glued " on the existing graph ; they trigger a chain of restructuring changes . If many new nodes connect to an existing node , it will probably have to increase its connectivity to accommo - date the new demand in tra(cid:14)c . In other words , the change propagates to the rest of the network like a fading wave . Therefore , at any time the topology is characterized by the same fundamental properties . As an analogy , we can think of a heap of sand that we create by dropping sand from one point . At any given moment , the heap is a cone , though its size changes and the grains are just dropped unorderly . The above intuitive understanding of the network topol - ogy is reinforced by the fact that this kind of dynamic equi - librium , and power - laws characterize many natural systems . First , power - laws govern the nature of various networks . The tra(cid:14)c of the Internet and the World Wide Web is char - acterized by power - laws , as we already saw in section 2 . Fur - thermore , power - laws describe the topology of multiple real networks of biological and geographical nature such as the human respiratory system [ 12 ] with a scaling factor of 2 : 9 , and automobile networks [ 6 ] with an exponent of 1 : 6 . Sec - ond , power - laws are obeyed in diverse settings , like income distribution ( the \ Pareto law " ) , and the frequency distribu - tion of words in natural text ( the \ Zipf distribution " [ 28 ] ) . 6 Conclusions Our main contribution is a novel way to study the Inter - net topology , namely through power - laws . These power - laws capture concisely the highly skewed distributions of the graph properties and quantify them by single numbers , the power - law exponents . Our contributions can be summarized in the following points : (cid:15) We discover three power - laws that characterize the inter - domainInternettopology during the year of 1998 . (cid:15) Our power - laws hold for three Internet instances with high correlation coe(cid:14)cients . (cid:15) We propose the number of pairs , P ( h ) , within h hops , as a metric of the density of the graph and approximate it with the use of the hop - plot exponent , H . (cid:15) We derive formulas that link the exponents of our power - laws with vital graph metrics such as the num - ber of nodes , the number of edges , and the average neighborhood size . (cid:15) We propose power - law exponents , instead of averages , as an e(cid:14)cient way to describe the highly - skewed graph metrics which we examined . Apart from their theoretical interest , we showed a num - ber of practical applications of our power - laws . First , our power - laws can assess the realism of synthetic graphs , and enhance the validity of our simulations . Second , they can help analyze the average - case behavior of network proto - cols . For example , we can estimate the message complexity of protocols using our estimate for the neighborhood size . Third , the power - laws can help answer \ what - if " scenar - ios like \ what will be the diameter of the Internet , when the number of nodes doubles ? " \ what will be the number of edges then ? " In addition , we decompose and measure the Internet in a way that relates to the state - of - the - art graph generation models . This decomposition provides measurements that fa - cilitate the selection of parameters for the graph generators . For the future , we believe that our suggestion to look for power - laws will open the (cid:13)oodgates to discovering many additional power - laws of the Internet topology . Our opti - mism is based on two facts : ( a ) power - laws are intimately re - lated to fractals , chaos and self - similarity [ 21 ] and ( b ) there is overwhelming evidence that self - similarity appears in a large number of settings , ranging from tra(cid:14)c patterns in networks [ 24 ] , to biological and economical systems [ 12 ] .

A Decomposing the Internet We analyze the Internet in a way that suits the graph genera - tor models [ 27 ] . The measurements we present can facilitate the selection of parameters for these generators . We study the graphs through their decomposition into two components : the tree component that contains all nodes that belong exclusively to trees and the core component that contains the rest of the nodes including the roots of the trees . We measure several parameters from this decomposi - tion that are shown in Table 7 . These results leads to the following observations . (cid:15) Approximately half of the nodes are in trees 40 - 50 % (cid:15) The number of nodes in trees decreased with time by 10 % means that the Internet becomes more connected all around . (cid:15) The maximum tree depth is 3 , however more than 80 % of the trees have depth one . (cid:15) More than 95 % of the tree - nodes have a degree of one . This leads to the following interesting observation : if we remove the nodes with outdegree one from the orig - inal graph , we practically get the core component . These observations can help users select appropriate values for the parameters used in various graph generation tech - niques [ 27 ] .

Note that ACC is the absolute value of the correlation coef - (cid:12)cient . C The Proofs Here we prove the Lemmas we present in our paper . Lemma 1 . The outdegree , dv , of a node v , is a function of the rank of the node , rv and the rank exponent , R , as follows dv = 1 N R r R v Proof . We can estimate the proportionality constant , C , for Power - Law 1 , if we require that the outdegree of the N - th node is one , dN = 1 . dN = C N R ) C = 1 = N R ( 2 ) We combine Power - Law 2 with Equation 2 , and conclude the proof . Lemma 2 . The number of edges , E , of a graph can be estimated as a function of the number of nodes , N , and the rank exponent , R , as follows : E = 1 2 ( R + 1 ) ( 1 (cid:0) 1 N R + 1 ) N Proof : The sum of all the outdegrees for all the ranks is equal to two times the number of edges , since we count each edge twice . 2 E = N X rv = 1 dv 2 E = N X rv = 1 ( rv = N ) R = ( 1 = N ) R N X rv = 1 r R v E (cid:25) 1 2 N R Z N 1 r R v drv ( 3 ) In the last step , above we approximate the summation with an integral . Calculating the integral concludes the proof .
