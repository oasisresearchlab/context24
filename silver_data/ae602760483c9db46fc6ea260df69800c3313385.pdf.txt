RES EAR CH Open Access CRISPR / CAS9 - mediated knockout of Abi1 inhibits p185 Bcr - Abl - induced leukemogenesis and signal transduction to ERK and PI3K / Akt pathways James Faulkner † , Peixin Jiang † , Delaney Farris , Ryan Walker and Zonghan Dai * Abstract Background : Abl interactor 1 ( Abi1 ) is a downstream target of Abl tyrosine kinases and a component of the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) that plays an important role in regulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling and membrane receptor signaling . While studies using short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) have suggested that Abi1 plays a critical role in Bcr - Abl - induced leukemogenesis , the mechanism involved is not clear . Methods : In this study , we knocked out Abi1 expression in p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed hematopoietic cells using CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated gene editing technology . The effects of Abi1 deficiency on actin cytoskeleton remodeling , the Bcr - Abl signaling , IL - 3 independent growth , and SDF - induced chemotaxis in these cells were examined by various in vitro assays . The leukemogenic activity of these cells was evaluated by a syngeneic mouse transplantation model . Results : We show here that Abi1 deficiency reduced the IL3 - independent growth and SDF - 1 α - mediated chemotaxis in p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed hematopoietic cells and inhibited Bcr - Abl - induced abnormal actin remodeling . Depletion of Abi1 also impaired the Bcr - Abl signaling to the ERK and PI3 kinase / Akt pathways . Remarkably , the p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed cells with Abi1 deficiency lost their ability to develop leukemia in syngeneic mice . Even though these cells developed drug tolerance in vitro after prolonged selection with imatinib as their parental cells , the imatinib - tolerant cells remain incapable of leukemogenesis in vivo . Conclusions : Together , this study highlights an essential role of Abi1 in Bcr - Abl - induced leukemogenesis and provides a model system for dissecting the Abi1 signaling in Bcr - Abl - positive leukemia . Keywords : Abi1 , Bcr - Abl - positive B - ALL , Leukemogenesis , Actin cytoskeleton , Drug resistance Background The Bcr - Abl oncogene is generated by a reciprocal t ( 9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11 ) chromosome translocation known as Philadel - phia chromosome ( Ph ) , which fuses varying amounts of the breakpoint cluster region ( Bcr ) gene on chromosome 22 with sequences upstream of the second exon of cellular Abl ( cAbl ) gene on chromosome 9 . Depending on the amount of Bcr sequences fused , three different Bcr - Abl fusion pro - teins may be produced with molecular masses of 185 kilo - dalton ( Kd ) ( p185 Bcr - Abl ) , 210 Kd ( p210 Bcr - Abl ) , and 230 Kd ( p230 Bcr - Abl ) [ 1 – 3 ] . p210 Bcr - Abl expression is a causative event in over 95 % of human chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) cases , while p185 Bcr - Abl is found in 60 – 80 % of Ph - positive B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia ( Ph + B - ALL ) © The Author ( s ) . 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4 . 0 International License , which permits use , sharing , adaptation , distribution and reproduction in any medium or format , as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author ( s ) and the source , provide a link to the Creative Commons licence , and indicate if changes were made .

Journal of Hematology & Oncology ( 2020 ) 13 : 34 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s13045 - 020 - 00867 - 5 cases [ 3 – 5 ] . Development of the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibi - tor ( TKI ) imatinib and other second - generation TKIs , dasa - tinib and nilotinib , has revolutionized the treatment of Ph + leukemia , with remarkable rates of sustained complete cyto - genetic remission and disease - free survival for CML patients at the chronic phase [ 6 ] . However , relapse is often observed in the patients with Ph + B - ALL or advanced CML due to the persistence of leukemic progenitor cells and accumula - tion of additional mutations that result in drug resistance [ 6 – 8 ] . A major challenge in the treatment of Ph + leukemia has been in developing novel therapies for patients who are resistant to TKI - based therapy . The hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells isolated from Ph + leukemia patients exhibit multiple abnormalities of cytoskeletal function such as increased motility , altered adhesion , and decreased response to stromal cell - derived factor 1 α ( SDF - 1 α ) [ 9 – 11 ] . These abnormalities may play a critical role in the progression of leukemia , since al - tered adhesion and mobility may contribute to prema - ture release of leukemic stem / progenitor cells from bone marrow and accumulation and infiltration of these cells in peripheral hematopoietic tissues such as blood , spleen , and liver . Abnormal actin remodeling may also contribute to the deregulation of leukemic progenitor cell proliferation and survival [ 11 ] . Bcr - Abl oncoproteins exert their oncogenic potential in cooperation with add - itional cytoplasmic and nuclear effectors such as those involved in the regulation of mitogenic and apoptotic pathways [ 1 , 5 ] . They are also capable of binding to cyto - skeleton proteins and other proteins involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration [ 1 , 5 , 12 ] . Among these proteins is the Abl interactor 1 ( Abi1 ) [ 13 ] , a key regulator of Rac - dependent actin polymerization [ 14 , 15 ] . Abi1 is present in cells as a complex with WA SP - family verprolin - homologous ( WAVE ) proteins , Nck - associated protein ( Nap ) , specif - ically Rac - associated ( Sra ) protein , and hematopoietic stem progenitor cell 300 ( Hspc 300 ) [ 14 , 16 – 18 ] . The macromolecular complex , named WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) , regulates initiation of actin polymerization in response to signal transduction from membrane receptors to small GTP - binding proteins and PI3 kinase ( PI3K ) [ 19 – 21 ] . In addition to the interac - tions with Abl , WAVE and Nap , Abi proteins were also found to interact with a variety of other signaling mole - cules that are involved in the control of cell prolifera - tion , apoptosis , cytoskeletal functions , receptor signaling , endocytosis , and trafficking [ 19 , 21 – 29 ] . Despite the im - portance of Abi1 in intracellular signaling , its role in cancer and leukemia development remains unclear . Pre - viously , we have shown that the knockdown of Abi1 expression by sequence - specific small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) inhibited p185 Bcr - Abl - stimulated cell adhesion and migration in vitro and impaired p185 Bcr - Abl - induced leukemogenesis in vivo [ 30 , 31 ] . In these studies , how - ever , the leukemogenesis was delayed but not eliminated , possibly due to incomplete Abi1 depletion [ 30 ] . In addition , studies by Chorzalska et al . suggest that the low expression of Abi1 may associate with drug resist - ance of Bcr - Abl - positive leukemic cells , whereas Juskevi - cius et al . reported that relapsing diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) more commonly displayed gains of a cluster of genes including Abi1 [ 32 , 33 ] . More recently , Chorzalska et al . reported that bone marrow - specific knockout of Abi1 induces myeloproliferative neoplasm [ 34 ] . Studies in other cancer cells involving the role of Abi1 in cancer development in vitro and in vivo are also contradictory . While the studies of breast cancer and colorectal carcinoma cells support a role of Abi1 in breast cancer and colorectal cancer development in vitro and in vivo [ 35 – 37 ] , other studies suggest that Abi1 may function as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer and gastric carcinoma development [ 38 – 40 ] . To determine the role of Abi1 in p185 Bcr - Abl - positive leukemia devel - opment , we set to completely deplete its expression in p185 Bcr - Abl - positive leukemic cells using CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated gene editing . Here , we report that Abi1 is involved in regulation of the Bcr - Abl signaling to down - stream pathways including mitogen - activated protein ki - nases ( MAPK ) and PI3K - Akt pathways . The complete depletion of Abi1 not only inhibits Bcr - Abl - induced ab - normal actin polymerization , cell proliferation , and cell migration in vitro , but also inhibits leukemogenesis in vivo . Moreover , the inhibition of Bcr - Abl - induced leukemia by Abi1 deficiency is independent of the sensi - tivity of these cells to imatinib , as the imatinib - tolerant p185 Bcr - Abl cells also require Abi1 for development of leukemia in vivo . Materials and methods Cell lines and reagents Ba / F3 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 15 % WEHI3 - conditioned medium as a source of IL3 . The Ba / F3 cell lines express - ing p185 Bcr - Abl with or without Abi1 deficiency were cul - tured in RPMI containing 10 % FBS . The preparation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Abi1 and Abi2 has been described previously [ 41 , 42 ] . The antibodies against Abl were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy , Inc . ( Santa Cruz , CA ) and the rabbit monoclonal antibodies for pan - and phospho - Akt ( Ser 473 ) , p38 MAPK , phospho - p38 ( Thr180 / Tyr182 ) , p42 / 44 ERK , and phospho - p42 / 44 ERK ( Thr202 / Tyr204 ) were ob - tained from the Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . ( Dan - vers , MA ) . The monoclonal anti - β - actin antibody and the protease inhibitor cocktail were purchased from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . Faulkner et al . Journal of Hematology & Oncology ( 2020 ) 13 : 34 Page 2 of 12 CRISPR / CAS9 - mediated gene editing To generate Abi1 deficient p185 Bcr - Abl cells , CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated gene editing was performed . Both strands of oligo DNAs encoding for two gRNAs that specifically target Abi1 exon 1 sequences ( gRNA A : 5 ′ AGGA - GATCCCGTCTGGCAAG3 ′ and gRNA B : 5 ′ TTTCA - CAGTAGTCCGCCACC3 ′ , Fig . 1 ) were designed using an online CRISPR design tool [ 43 ] . The two pairs of oli - gos were synthesized , annealed , and cloned into plasmid pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro , a gift from Feng Zhang ( Addgene plasmid no . 48139 ; http : / / n2t . net / addgene : 4813 9 ; RRID : Addgene _ 48139 ) , respectively , at the BbsI site [ 43 ] . The resultant plasmids , pSpCas9 Abi1 KOA and pSpCas9 KOB , were amplified and transfected into p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed Ba / F3 cells by electroporation . The transfected cells were serially diluted in 24 - well plate in RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 15 % WEHI3 - conditioned medium as a source of IL3 . The stably transfected cell lines were selected by 2 μ g / ml puromycin . The stably transfected clonal lines with complete depletion of Abi1 expression were initially identified by western blot analysis . Indel mutations analysis of Abi1 knockout cell lines To analyze indel mutations in p185 Bcr - Abl Abi1 knockout cells , the genomic DNAs from the knockout clonal lines were purified using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purifica - tion kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . Polymerization chain reaction ( PCR ) was then performed to amplify ABI1 exon 1 using the genomic DNA as template and the fol - lowing oligos as primers : forward 5 ′ GAGAGTAAG - GAGGAAGAGGAGG 3 ′ and reverse 5 ′ GACCTC AGCCAGGGCAGGTGG 3 ′ . The amplified DNA was digested by restriction enzyme and cloned to plasmid pBSK at the Sac I site . The resultant plasmids were se - quenced to identify indel ( Fig . 1 ) . Biochemical assay Western blot analyses were performed as previously de - scribed [ 44 ] . Briefly , control Ba / F3 cells and Ba / F3 cells expressing p185 Bcr - Abl with or without ABI1 deficiency were lysed in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 ; 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 10 % glycerol ) and total cell lysates were separated on SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies . We used the ImageJ software program to quantify the levels of phosphorylated MAP kinases and Akt in three independent western blot assays . In vivo leukemogenesis studies A suspension of 1X10 6 Ba / F3 cells expressing p185 Bcr - Abl with or without ABI1 deficiency was injected into 6 – 8 weeks old female BALB / c mice through the tail vein . Because Ba / F3 cells are considered syngeneic to BALB / c mouse , no irradiation was given to the recipient mice . The mice were followed for disease development , as judged by symptoms such as abnormal gait and labored breathing . Moribund animals were sacrificed by CO 2 as - phyxiation and were examined for tumors or other vis - ible abnormalities . Collection of spleens and livers was performed immediately after sacrifice and the tissues were fixed . Tissue sections were prepared and haemo - toxylin and eosin ( H & E ) stain of the sections was performed by Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic La - boratories . All protocols used were approved by Institu - tional Animal Review Committee at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center . Cell migration assay The cell migration assay was performed as described previously [ 45 ] . Ba / F3 cells expressing p185 Bcr - Abl with or without ABI1 deficiency were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium at a concentration of 1 × 10 6 cells / ml . A suspension of 0 . 1 ml cells was then added into the in - serts of Transwell plates ( 8 - μ m pores , Corning Costar Corp . , Cambridge , MA ) and cells were allowed to mi - grate to the bottom chamber containing 0 . 6 ml RPMI 1640 with or without 50 ng / ml of SDF - 1 α at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator for 12 h . Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis Cultured Ba / F3 cell lines expressing p185 Bcr - Abl with or without ABI1 deficiency were fixed in 4 % parafor - maldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 10 min , permeabilized in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 5 min , and stained with 50 μ g / ml TRITC - conjugated phalloidin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) in PBS . After washing cells exten - sively with PBS and briefly staining them with DAPI ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) to visualize nuclei , 5 – 10 × 10 3 cells were loaded per slide by cytospin and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium ( Vector , Burlingame , CA ) . Images were captured and analyzed using Olympus IX81 microscope with asso - ciated Image software . Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were generated for all quantitative data with presentation of means ± SDs . Significance of comparisons between experimental groups was tested using the Student ’ s t test . Results CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated Abi1 gene editing in p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed Ba / F3 cells To determine the role of Abi1 in Bcr - Abl - induced cellular transformation and leukemogenesis , we used CRISPR / Faulkner et al . Journal of Hematology & Oncology ( 2020 ) 13 : 34 Page 3 of 12 Cas9 - mediated gene editing to deplete Abi1 gene expres - sion in p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed Ba / F3 cells ( hereinafter re - ferred to p185 Bcr - Abl cells ) . A mix of two plasmid DNAs , each containing a Cas9 gene and a gene encoding for a gRNA ( gRNA A or B , Fig . 1a ) that targets different regions in the mouse ABI1 exon 1 , was introduced into p185 Bcr - Abl cells . As a control , a plasmid expressing Cas9 only was also introduced into the p185 Bcr - Abl cells ( hereinafter re - ferred to p185 control cells ) . Insertion and deletion ( Indel ) mutation analysis identified two independent clonal lines , p185 KO2 . 3 , which has a 5 - base pair ( bp ) deletion , and p185KO6 . 2 , which has a 44 - bp deletion in the Abi1 exon 1 ( Fig . 1a ) . These deletions cause a reading frame shift and premature stop of Abi1 protein translation . Consistently , western blot analysis shows that the Abi1 expression is completely depleted in p185 KO2 . 3 and p185 KO6 . 2 cells as compared to p185 control cells ( Fig . 1b ) . Previously , we have shown that the expression of Bcr - Abl in hematopoietic cells induces the degradation of Abi2 through an ubiquitin - dependent proteolysis path - way [ 41 ] . To determine if Abi1 knockout affects Bcr - Abl - induced Abi2 degradation , we examined the protein level of Abi2 in p185 KO2 . 3 and KO6 . 2 cells . Consistent with the previous report [ 41 ] , the expression of Abi2 is lost in p185 control cells as compared to parental Ba / F3 cells ( Fig . 1c ) . Similarly , no Abi2 was detected in p185 KO2 . 3 and p185 KO6 . 2 cells ( Fig . 1c ) , suggesting that Bcr - Abl - induced downregulation of Abi2 is not affected by Abi1 depletion . Knockout of Abi1 inhibited cell proliferation , SDF - induced chemotaxis , and invadopodia formation in p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed Ba / F3 cells Transformation of Ba / F3 cells by p185 Bcr - Abl resulted in interleukin 3 ( IL3 ) - independent growth . Knockout of Abi1 in p185 Bcr - Abl cells did not abolish IL3 - independent cell growth ( Fig . 2a ) . However , Abi1 deficiency resulted in a slower cell growth of p185 KO2 . 3 and p185 KO6 . 2 cells ( 2 . 4 - fold and 5 . 6 - fold reduction , respectively ) in IL3 - free medium as compared to that of the p185 control cells ( Fig . 2a ) . To determine if the Abi1 depletion affects cell migra - tion , we examined the SDF - 1 α - induced chemotaxis of the p185 KO2 . 3 and p185 KO6 . 2 cells using Boyden chamber transwell migration assay and compare it to that of p185 control cells . As shown in Fig . 2 b , addition of 50 ng / ml of SDF - 1 α in the bottom chamber stimu - lated p185 control cell migration by 11 - fold as compared to that without SDF - 1 α . In contrast , 50 ng / ml SDF - 1 α failed to induce the p185 KO2 . 3 and p185 KO6 . 2 cells to migrate to the bottom chamber ( Fig . 2b ) . Thus , our data suggests that the depletion of Abi1 in these cells inhibits the SDF - 1 α - induced chemotaxis .

Total lysates from 5 × 10 5 cells of each cell line , as indicated , were subjected to Western blot analysis with indicated antibodies Faulkner et al . Journal of Hematology & Oncology ( 2020 ) 13 : 34 Page 4 of 12 We and others have previously shown that the expres - sion of p185 Bcr - Abl in Ba / F3 cells induced a profound actin cytoskeleton remodeling and invadopodia formation [ 44 , 46 ] . Specifically , an invadopodia structure characterized by intensively staining with phalloidin , indicative of fila - ment actin ( F - actin ) aggregates , was observed in 66 % of p185 control cells , but not in Ba / F3 cells ( Fig . 2c ) . Deple - tion of Abi1 resulted in a 7 - and 8 - fold reduction , respect - ively , in this invadopodium formation in the p185 KO2 . 3 and p185 KO6 . 2 cells ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Abi1 deficiency impaired the Bcr - Abl signaling to downstream pathways Abi1 is a component of WRC that regulates WAVE actin nucleation promoting activity and links WAVE to the Abl tyrosine kinases . To determine the effect of Abi1 depletion on the WRC signaling , we examined the pro - tein level of WAVE2 in p185 Bcr - Abl Abi1 knockout cells . In line with the results reported by other investigators [ 15 , 16 , 27 ] , the knockout of Abi1 in p185 Bcr - Abl cells resulted in a marked reduction of WAVE2 protein level ( Fig . 3a ) . Next , we tested if the Abi1 depletion affects the Bcr - Abl signaling to other downstream pathways . The mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathways and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) - Akt pathway have been shown previously to be acti - vated by Bcr - Abl and their activation plays a key role in Bcr - Abl - induced leukemogenesis [ 1 , 5 ] . To deter - mine if the Abi1 deficiency affects the Bcr - Abl signal - ing to MAPK pathways , we examined the activation of p38 MAPK and p42 / 44 extracellular signal – regu - lated kinases ( p42 / 44 ERK ) in p185 Abi1 knockout cells using antibodies that recognize phosphorylated and activated p38 MAPK and p42 / 44 ERK . As shown in Fig . 3 b and c , Abi1 depletion in p185 KO6 . 2 and p185 KO2 . 3 cells inhibited Bcr - Abl - induced p42 / 44 ERK activation by 96 % and 73 % , respectively , as com - pared to that in p185 Cas9 control cells . The Abi1 deficiency also decreased p38 MAPK activation by 67 % in p185 KO6 . 2 cells as compared to that in p185 Fig . 2 Effects of Abi1 deficiency on IL3 - independent cell growth , SDF - induced chemotaxis , and F - actin remodeling of the p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed Ba / F3 cells . a .

The p185 Cas9 control cells ( Cas9 Ctrl ) and two independent lines of p185 Abi1 knockout cells ( KO2 . 3 and KO6 . 2 ) were tested in Transwell plate ( 1 . 0 × 10 5 / insert ) for SDF1 α ( 50 ng / ml ) stimulated migration .

This decrease in p38 MAPK activation , however , was not observed in p185 KO2 . 3 cells ( Fig . 3b , c ) . Because the previous studies have shown an association between Abi1 and PI3K [ 20 , 47 ] , we also examined the PI3K / Akt pathway using anti - phosphorylated Akt antibodies that recognize ac - tivated Akt . We found that the depletion of Abi1 in p185 KO6 . 2 and p185 KO2 . 3 cells reduced the Bcr - Abl - induced Akt activation by 73 % and 60 % , respect - ively , as compared to that in p185 Cas9 control cells ( Fig . 3d ) . Taken together , our data supports a role of Abi1 in regulating the Bcr - Abl signaling to ERK and PI3K / Akt pathways . Abi1 is essential for Bcr - Abl - induced leukemogenesis in vivo Complete knockout of Abi1 expression in p185 Bcr - Abl cells allowed us to test if Abi1 is required for Bcr - Abl - induced leukemogenesis in vivo . To this end , we injected p185 Bcr - Abl control , two independent lines of p185 Abi1 knockout cells p185 KO2 . 3 and p185 KO6 . 2 , or saline as control into syngeneic Balb / C mice through tail vein . All recipient mice were then followed for the development of leukemia . As reported previously , while the control mice injected with saline were healthy with no sign of disease for up to 6 months , the mice injected with p185 Bcr - Abl control cells developed leukemia in 2 to 3 weeks . These mice either died or be - came moribund with a mean survival of 18 . 9 days ( Table 1 and Fig . 4 ) . In contrast , all the mice injected with p185 KO 6 . 2 cells and 70 % of the mice injected with p185 KO 2 . 3 cells were healthy with no signs of disease for up to 6 months ( Table 1 and Fig . 4 ) . Only one out of ten mice injected with p185 KO 2 . 3 cells developed leukemia ap - proximately 4 - month post - transplantation and two others developed solid tumors around chest ( the mouse p185 KO2 . 3 A2 , Table 1 ) and gastrointestinal tissues ( the mouse p185 KO2 . 3 A1 , Table 1 ) , respectively . Gross path - ology analysis revealed that all the mice injected with p185 control cells developed splenomegaly and hepatomegaly ( Table 1 and Fig . 5a , b ) , whereas no apparent splenomeg - aly nor hepatomegaly was observed in all mice injected with p185 KO 6 . 2 cells and 90 % of the mice injected with p185 KO 2 . 3 cells ( Table 1 and Fig . 5a , b ) . Histopathology analysis showed that the destruction of normal cytoarchi - tecture in the spleen and liver due to the massive accumu - lation of p185 Bcr - Abl - positive leukemic cells which are morphologically distinguishable from normal cells , was Fig . 3 Abi1 deficiency in the p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed Ba / F3 cells reduced WAVE2 expression and the Bcr - Abl signaling to MAPK and PI3 kinases . a .

Journal of Hematology & Oncology ( 2020 ) 13 : 34 Page 6 of 12 observed in the mice injected with p185 control cells ( Fig . 5c ) . In contrast , no apparent abnormality of the splenic and hepatic cytoarchitecture was observed in the mice injected with p185 Abi1 knockout cells ( Fig . 5c ) . Abi1 is required for leukemogenic activity of imatinib - tolerant p185 Bcr - Abl cells While the therapies using Bcr - Abl tyrosine kinase inhibi - tors achieve deep remissions and long - term survival for CML patients , overall survival of the patients with p185 Bcr - Abl - positive ALL is still low and drug resistance is more frequently observed [ 6 – 8 ] . Treatment of p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed Ba / F3 cells with imatinib for 48 h resulted in over 99 % and 90 % cell death in p185 control cells and in p185 Abi1 knockout cells , respect - ively ( Fig . 6a ) . However , some cells survived and grew up after prolonged treatment . To determine if Abi1 defi - ciency in p185 Bcr - Abl cells affects their sensitivity to ima - tinib , we selected the p185 Cas9 and p185 Abi1 knockout cells that are resistant to imatinib by culturing these cell in 1 . 25 μ m imatinib , a dosage that leads to 90 % cell death of p185 control cells within 72 h ( Fig . 6b ) , for over 6 weeks . Under this selection , a small portion of p185 control and p185 Abi1 KO cells survived and even - tually expanded . These cells , referred as imatinib resist - ant cells ( IM r ) , were then examined for growth and survival at the presence of imatinib . As shown in Fig . 6 b , while imatinib treatment resulted in 90 % cell death of parental p185 control cells in 72 h , only 16 % cell death was observed in imatinib - resistant p185 control cells ( p185 control IM r ) under the same condition . Like p185 control cells , imatinib treatment led to 94 % and 83 % cell death of p185 Abi1 KO 2 . 3 and KO 6 . 2 cells in 72 h , re - spectively ( Fig . 6b ) . The imatinib - resistant p185 Abi1 KO 2 . 3 and KO 6 . 2 cells , however , showed a higher sen - sitivity to imatinib than that of p185 control IM r cells , as the imatinib treatment resulted in greater cell death ( 20 . 4 % and 40 . 4 % , respectively ) in these cells compared to that observed in p185 control IM r cells ( Fig . 6b ) . The imatinib tolerance of p185 control IM r cells was also observed in vivo ( Fig . 6c ) . The mice injected with parental p185 control cells or p185 control IM r cells both developed leukemia and died around 3 – 4 weeks post - injection . A 5 - day treatment of mice with imatinib improved the survival of the mice injected with p185 control cells to 5 weeks . However , the treatment failed to extend the survival of the mice injected with p185 control IM r cells , as these mice died in 3 – 4 weeks ( Fig . 6c ) . To determine if the imatinib - insensitive p185 KO2 . 3 IM r cells and p185 KO 6 . 2 IM r cells regain the leukemogenic activity in vivo , we injected these cells into mice and monitored leukemia development . In contrast to the mice injected with p185 control IM r cells , which developed leukemia within 3 – 4 weeks regardless whether treated with or without imatinib ( Fig . 6d ) , all mice injected with p185 KO6 . 2 IM r and 4 out of 5 mice injected with p185 KO2 . 3 IM r showed no sign of disease for over 5 months . One out of 5 mice injected with p185 KO2 . 3 IM r developed leukemia with much prolonged la - tency ( > 4 months ) . Taken together , our data suggests that Abi1 is also essential for leukemia development in imatinib - tolerant p185 Bcr - Abl cells . Discussion To dissect how Abi1 functions in Bcr - Abl - induced leukemogenesis , we knocked it out in p185 Bcr - Abl Ba / F3 cells by CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated gene editing . Two inde - pendent knockout cell lines were obtained .

Journal of Hematology & Oncology ( 2020 ) 13 : 34 Page 8 of 12 depletion of Abi1 in these cells is confirmed by nucleo - tide insertion / deletion ( indel ) analysis as well as by pro - tein expression analysis . In these cells , the expression of Abi2 is also dramatically downregulated due to Bcr - Abl - induced activation of proteolytic pathways , as we previ - ously described [ 41 ] . Complete depletion of Abi1 and markedly reduced expression of Abi2 in these cells pro - vide a simplified system for analysis of the role of the Abi pathway in Bcr - Abl - induced leukemogenesis . We have previously knocked down the expression of Abi1 in p185 Bcr - Abl cells by short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) - mediated gene silencing [ 30 ] . We have observed that re - duced expression of Abi1 inhibited Bcr - Abl - stimulated invadopodia formation and cell migration in vitro . In line with these previous studies , we show here that complete Abi1 depletion abrogates Bcr - Abl - induced invadopodia formation and cell migration . Although the studies with shRNA - mediated gene silencing also sug - gested that Abi1 might be essential for p185 Bcr - Abl - in - duced leukemogenesis , a definitive conclusion could not be made because of incomplete depletion of Abi1 . Spe - cifically , despite the prolonged latency , the mice receiv - ing p185 Bcr - Abl cells in which Abi1 expression had been knocked down eventually developed leukemia and be - came moribund approximately 5 - week post - injection [ 30 ] . The leukemia development in these mice is likely due to the selective expansion of those p185 Bcr - Abl cells in which Abi1 has not been knocked down , as suggested by the analyses of both the Abi1 expression in p185 Bcr - Abl cells recovered from leukemic mice and the competitive in vivo expansion assay [ 30 ] . This is further supported by the studies presented here . Remarkably , we found that complete depletion of Abi1 abolishes the leukemic potential of p185 Bcr - Abl cells and the mice Fig . 6 Effect of imatinib treatment on IL3 - independent growth and leukemogenesis of Abi1 - deficient p185 Bcr - Abl cells . a .

The Balb / C mice were injected through tail vein with 1X10 6 p185 Ctrl or p185 IMr cells , as indicated . Ten days post - injection the mice were administered intraperitoneally once a day with either saline as control or imatinib ( IM , 100 mg / Kg body weight ) , as indicated , for 5 consecutive days . Survival of the mice were monitored and expressed as the percentage of survival . d . The Abi1 deficient p185 Bcr - Abl cells tolerant to imatinib failed to develop leukemia in syngeneic mice .

Ten days post - injection the mice injected with p185 Ctrl IMr cells were administered intraperitoneally once a day with imatinib ( IM , 100 mg / Kg body weight ) for 5 consecutive days . Survival of the mice were monitored and represented as the percentage of survival Faulkner et al . Journal of Hematology & Oncology ( 2020 ) 13 : 34 Page 9 of 12 implanted with these cells are leukemia free for over 6 months . Abi1 is a component of WRC , a key regulator of actin dynamics in the leading edge of motile cells that plays a critical role in cell adhesion , migration , and invasion . In addition to its association with WRC , Abi1 also inter - acts with a variety of important signaling molecules downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases , including Abl , Cbl , Sos , Eps8 , and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K [ 19 – 21 , 25 , 48 ] . It has been reported that , as a subunit of WRC , Abi1 interacts with diverse receptors and links them to the actin cytoskeleton [ 28 , 29 ] . The ability to interact with the regulatory machinery of actin assem - bly as well as diverse signaling molecules and mem - brane receptors places Abi1 at a central position in the signaling network that integrates signals from mem - brane receptors to cytoskeletal functions . Consistent with this notion , knockout of Abi1 expression in mice leads to lethality in the early embryo stage [ 49 , 50 ] . More recent studies by Chorzalska et al . show that bone marrow ( BM ) - specific loss of Abi1 results in ab - normal hematopoietic cell development including anemia , premature exhaustion of BM hematopoietic stem cells , myeloproliferative neoplasm , and defects in B cell development [ 34 ] . Similar phenotypes were also observed in an earlier study by Park et al . in which they knocked out Hem1 , another component of WRC , in mice [ 51 ] . They show that depletion of Hem1 resulted in degradation of Abi1 and WAVE2 . Remarkably , Hem1 - deficient mice also exhibit anemia , lymphopenia , neutrophilia , and defects of lymphoid B and T cell de - velopment . More recently , Shao et al . show that Hem1 and WRC are required for transition of fetal liver hematopoiesis to BM [ 52 ] . These studies are consistent with our findings that Abi1 is essential for the p185 Bcr - Abl signaling and leukemogenesis in a trans - formed pro - B cell line . Taken together , our studies and those of others highlight an important role of Abi1 in hematopoietic cell development , homeostasis , and leukemogenesis . The complete depletion of Abi1 in p185 Bcr - Abl cells al - lows for loss of function analysis of Abi1 in the Bcr - Abl signaling and this has led to the findings that would be dif - ficult to be uncovered by the analysis of reduced expres - sion of Abi1 . In previous studies , we found that , while partial depletion of Abi1 in p185 Bcr - Abl cells by shRNA - mediated gene silencing impaired these cells expansion in vivo , it did not affect Bcr - Abl - induced IL3 - independent growth in vitro [ 30 ] . This is in contrast with present stud - ies which show that the complete depletion of Abi1 not only abrogates leukemia development in vivo but also re - duces IL3 - independent growth in vitro . It is likely that the low expression of Abi1 in Abi1 - knockdown cells may exert a growth disadvantage in an in vivo environment but it may not be sufficient to cause growth inhibition in vitro . Chorzalska et al . have reported that low expression of Abi1 in CD34 + cells from CML patients and K562 CML cell line is linked to drug resistance and is associated with elevated activation of ERK and Akt , the pathways that are activated by Bcr - Abl and are important for Bcr - Abl - induced cell growth and leukemia development [ 32 ] . In p185 Bcr - Abl Abi1 knockout cells examined in our studies , however , complete depletion of Abi1 decreased ERK and Akt activation . The reduced ERK and Akt activity in p185 Bcr - Abl Abi1 KO cells is consistent with the finding that these cells grow slower in vitro and fail to develop leukemia in vivo . To test whether the Abi1 depletion links to the drug resistance , we examined the effect of imatinib on growth and survival of p185 Bcr - Abl cells and p185 Bcr - Abl Abi1 knockout cells . Our data suggests that the Abi1 pathway is essential for p185 Bcr - Abl - induced leukemia de - velopment regardless whether these cells develop imatinib resistance or not . Ba / F3 is a mouse pro - B cell line and the expression of p185 Bcr - Abl in Ba / F3 cells results in IL3 - independent growth . The p185 Bcr - Abl transformation of Ba / F3 cells also induces abnormal actin cytoskeleton re - modeling and Abi2 degradation . It is possible that the role of Abi1 in Bcr - Abl - induced leukemia development may vary among different hematopoietic cell lineages . In this regard , it is notable that although low expression of Abi1 is associated with increased activation of ERK and Akt pathways in hematopoietic cells from CML patients and the K562 CML cell line , such a converse correlation was not observed in Bcr - Abl - transformed Ba / F3 cells [ 32 ] . Moreover , while the BM - specific Abi1 deficiency leads to myeloproliferative neoplasm , it impairs B cell develop - ment in mice [ 34 ] . Further investigation is therefore needed to elucidate whether the Abi1 signaling functions differentially in different hematopoietic lineages . Conclusions In summary , studies presented here reveal that Abi1 is required for the leukemogenic activity of a p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed mouse pro - B cell line . Complete depletion of Abi1 leads to not only an inhibition of Bcr - Abl - induced actin cytoskeletal functions but also a decrease in IL3 - independent growth . Decreased cell proliferation in Abi1 - deficient p185 Bcr - Abl cells correlates with a re - duced activity of MAPK and PI3K / Akt pathways . Im - portantly , we found that Abi1 is essential for the leukemogenic activity of p185 Bcr - Abl - transformed cells regardless whether these cells developed imatinib resist - ance . Taken together , our data suggest that Abi1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for p185 Bcr - Abl - positive B - ALL .
