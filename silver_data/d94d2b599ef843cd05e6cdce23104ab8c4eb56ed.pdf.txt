In an attempt to determine whether NF2 serves as a tumor suppressor and if so whether its N - terminal half is in - volved in its anti - oncogenicity , both full - length NF2 and its N - terminal half ( NFg - N , residues 9 - 359 ) have been expressed in v - Ha - Ras - transformed NIH / 3T3 cells . Like neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) fragments ( Nur - E - Kamal , M . S . A , Varga , M . , and Maruta , H . ( 1993 ) J . Biol . Chem . 268 , 22331 - 223371 , full - length NF2 can reverse the Ras - induced malignant phenotype , Le . anchorage - inde - pendent growth in a soft agar , and restore contact inhi - bition of cell growth , indicating that NF2 is indeed a tumor suppressor . Furthermore , NF2 - N also suppresses the Ras - induced malignant phenotype , although it ap - pears to be less effective than the full - length NF2 . These observations indicate that the anti - Ras function of NF2 resides in part in its N - terminal half . Thus , NF2 appears to be a new member of the tumor suppressor family of actin - cytoskeleton - associated proteins , which includes vinculin , a - actinin , tropomyosin - 1 , gelsolin , and tensin . Oncogenic mutants of Ha - Ras , Ki - Ras , or N - Ras are found in around 30 % of total human carcinomas , notably in 50 % and 90 % of colon and pancreatic carcinomas , respectively ( 1 ) . On - cogenic mutants of Ras are locked in the active GTP - bound form ( 2 ) .

Fax : 613 - 347 - 1938 ; ’ The abbreviations used are : GAP , GTPase - activating protein ; PCR , GAP1 , which is 1044 amino acids , and NF1 , which is 2818 amino acids ( 3 , 4 ) . We have shown previously that neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) fragments of 338 and 91 amino acids ( NF338 and NF91 ) can reverse the malignant phenotype , i . e . anchorage - independ - ent growth in a soft agar , caused by Ras mutants such as v - Ha - Ras ( 5 ) . This was the first demonstration that a target of the tumor suppressor NF1 is the Ras - GTP complex as these NF1 fragments bind the Ras - GTP complex directly ( 5 ) . Dys - function or deletion of NF1 develops schwannomas and other tumors ( neurofibromatosis 1 ) in central nervous system of hu - man ( 6 ) . We and another group recently cloned a candidate for the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene located on hu - man chromosome 22q12 ( 7 , 8 ) . This gene encodes a protein of 595 amino acids called NF2 or Merlin ( 7 , 8 ) . Point mutations or truncation of NF2 have also been found to be closely associated with development of schwannomas and other central nervous system tumors including multiple meningiomas ( 7 - 11 ) . Inter - estingly , NF2 shares around 50 % sequence identity in its N - terminal half ( residues 1 - 358 ) with the corresponding domains of several members of an F - actin - binding protein family called TERM , which includes talin , gzrin , _ radixin , and goesin ( 7 , 8 ) . Very recently , at least four distinct actin - cytoskeleton - asso - ciated proteins were shown to act as tumor suppressors ( 12 - 15 ) ; overexpression of vinculin and a - actinin can reverse SV40 - induced malignant transformation ( 12 , 131 , whereas tro - pomyosin - 1 and gelsolin can reverse malignant transformation caused by Ras mutants such as v - Ha - Ras and v - Ki - Ras ( 14 , 151 . Interestingly , expression of the genes encoding these four actin - binding proteins is strongly suppressed when normal cells are transformed by SV - 40 virus or Ras oncogenes ( 14 ) . It is now clear that constitutive expression of these genes in SV40 - or Ras - transformed cells results in reversion of the malignant state ( 12 - 15 ) . Although NF2 is expressed widely in various human tissues ( 71 , it still remains to be clarified whether NF2 expression is down - regulated by Ras or other oncogenes . In this paper we demonstrate for the first time that ( i ) over - expression of NF2 can reverse the v - Ha - Ras - induced anchor - age - independent growth of NIW3T3 cells in a soft agar , ( ii ) the anti - Ras function of NF2 resides in its N - terminal half , and ( iii ) the level of NF2 mRNA is not down - regulated by v - Ha - Ras . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Construction of Plasmids Expressing Full - length NF2 and Its N - terminal Half in Mammalian Cells - An EcoRI DNA fragment of 1 . 8 kilobases encoding full - length human NF2 ( 7 , 8 ) was prepared from JJR - 1 cDNA ( 7 ) by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , and subcloned into retroviral vector pMV7 ( 16 ) , which also expresses a neomycin resistance selectable marker . The orientation of the insert was determined by HindIII digestion , as one HindIII site is located 100 base pairs down - stream of the EcoRI insertion site ( 16 ) and the other around codon 497 of NF2 DNA ( 8 ) . Another EcoRI DNAfragment of 1 . 1 kilobases encoding the N - terminal half of NF2 ( NF2 - N , residues 1 - 359 ) was also prepared by PCR , and subcloned into vector pMv7 in essentially the same man - ner as described for full - length NF2 . The orientation of the NFP - N insert was determined by HindIII digestion , as a second HindIII site is located around codon 289 of NF2 - N ( 8 ) . The resultant two plasmids , called NF2 / pMV7 and NF2 - N / pMV7 , respectively , were purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation for transfection . polymerase chain reaction ; RT , reverse transcriptase ; ACAP , actin - cy - toskeleton - associated protein ; MAP kinase , mitogen - activated protein kinase ; MEK , MAP kinase kinase . 23387 23388 NF2 Suppresses Ras - induced Malignancy Effect of NF2 and NF2 - N Dansfection on the Colony - forming Ability of v - Ha - Ras - transformed Cells in Soft Agar - v - Ha - Ras - transformed NIW3T3 cells were transfected with either NF2 / pMV7 or NF2 - N / pMV7 as complexes with liposomes as described previously ( 17 ) . A parallel transfection with vector pMV7 alone was also carried out to serve as a negative control . The resultant G4 . 18 - resistant transfectants were cloned in the presence of 400 pg / ml G418 ( a neomycin analogue ) as described previously ( 5 ) . The colony formation in a soft agar ( anchorage - independent growth ) of NF2 / pMV7 and NF2 - N / pMV7 clones , in com - parison with pMV7 clones , was examined by incubating 1000 cells / plate at 37 " C for 3 weeks under standard culture conditions ( 5 ) . The colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted . Reverse Danscriptase ( RT ) PCR Analysis of NF2 , NF2 - N , and u - Ha - Ras Expression - Total RNAs from both the parental v - Ha - Ras trans - formants and NF2 / NF2 - N transfectants were isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi ( 18 ) . 5 pg of each total RNA preparation was then used as a template to synthesize v - Ha - Ras and NF2 / NF2 - N cDNAs by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Promega ) and a Riboclone cDNA synthesis kit ( Promega ) , using the corresponding an - tisense PCR primers including the last several codons ( 17 ) . To compare the amount of these cDNAs between the Ras transformants and NF2 / NF2 - N transfectants , the same aliquots of all cDNA preparations were then used as PCR templates for Taq DNA polymerase to amplify exog - enous ( human ) or endogenous ( mouse ) NF2 , NF2 - N , or v - Ha - Ras cDNA sequences using the corresponding pairs of sense and antisense primers under essentially the same conditions as those described previously ( 17 , 19 ) . Under these PCR conditions , the amount of PCR products is linearly proportional to the initial amount of cDNAs used as templates and is far below the saturation point . The titration curves were drawn based on incorporation of la - " YPldGTP into the PCR bands , using both cloned v - Ha - Ras and NF2 DNAs at various concentrations ( 0 . 1 - 10 pg ) as the standard PCR templates ( data not shown ) . The human and mouse NF2 amino acid sequences are 98 % identical ( 20 , 21 ) , therefore , some pairs of the sense / antisense PCR primers cor - responding to the human NF2 base sequences are able to amplify the corresponding base sequences of mouse NF2 cDNA as well . For in - stance , sense primer S and antisense primer B , corresponding to codons 9 - 14 and codons 354 - 359 of human NF2 ( 8 ) , respectively , can be used to amplify both mouse and human sequences , whereas antisense primers A and C , corresponding to codons 335 / 336 - 340 ( AGCGAGGCGCTGC - CGC ) and codons 590 - 595 ( 8 ) , respectively , can be used for amplifying only human , and not mouse , sequences . Thus , PCR primers C and A were used to quantitate the levels of exogenous human NF2 and NF2 - N mRNAs , respectively , whereas PCR primer B was used to compare levels of endogenous mouse NF2 mRNAs between normal and Ras - transformed NIW3T3 cells or compare levels of endogenous ( mouse ) NF2 mRNAs in parental Ras transformants and exogenous ( human ) NF2 / NF2 - N mRNAs in NF2 / NF2 - N transfectants . RESULTS Anti - Ras Action of NF2 - Using a retroviral vector pMV7 , we have overexpressed full - length NF2 in v - Ha - Ras - transformed NIW3T3 cells under the control of long terminal repeats , and examined the effects of NF2 on their growth , in particular the anchorage - independent growth in a soft agar , which correlates with their malignancy . As shown in Fig . 1 ( top panel 1 , very few NF2 - overexpressing cells ( N ) formed large colonies in a soft agar . Under the same conditions , parental transformed cells ( 5 " ) formed many large colonies . Each of these large colonies contains more than 100 cells . Furthermore , although these NF2 transfectants still formed small colonies , the number of small colonies derived from NF2 transfectants was only about 10 % of that derived from parental transformed cells ( see Table I , experiment 1 ) . A quantitative RT PCR analysis of both v - Ha - Ras and NF2 mRNAs levels ( see Fig . 1 , bottom panel ) has confirmed that this dramatic reduction in both size and number of colonies was due to expression of NF2 , and not due to any reduction or loss of v - Ha - Ras expression . Thus , these data clearly indicate that , like NF1 fragments ( 51 , full - length NF2 can reverse a malignant phenotype caused by v - Ha - Ras .

Interestingly , when the cells are transformed by v - Ha - Ras or many other oncogenes , they lose this contact inhibition and continue to grow , piling up on one another after they have formed the confluent monolayer . Interestingly , NF2 transfectants derived from v - Ha - Ras - transformed cells are contact - inhibited ( see Fig . 2 ) . In a liquid culture , both the control v - Ha - Ras transformants and their NF2 transfectants grow at the almost same rate until they form a confluent monolayer . However , at confluence , NF2 transfectants cease to grow ( as do normal NIW3T3 fibroblasts ) , whereas control transformed cells continue to proliferate ( Fig . 2 ) . The Anti - Ras Function of NF2 Resides in Part in Its N - ter - minal Half - NF2 shares a high sequence identity ( around 50 % ) , mainly in the N - terminal domain ( NF2 - N , residues 1 - 358 ) , with several other members of an F - actin - binding pro - tein family ( TERM ) including talin , ezrin , radixin , and moesin ( 7 ) . The remaining domain of NF2 has no sequence homology to any domains of the TERM proteins . Thus , if its actin binding is sufficient for anti - Ras action of NF2 , NF2 - N is expected to NF2 Suppresses Ras - induced Malignancy 23389 Control 1 / + / = NF2 = / 0 2 4 6 8 ~ ~ ~ ~ Incubation Time .

Then only NF2 transfectants cease to grow ( as normal fibroblasts ) , whereas control transformants continue to grow and pile up on top of each other . suppress v - Ha - Ras - induced malignant transformation . As shown in Table I ( experiment 21 , NF2 - N transfection indeed significantly reduces the colony - forming ability of v - Ha - Ras transformants in a soft agar , but its anti - Ras action ( average 77 % suppression ) appears to be less efficient than that of full - length NF2 ( average 87 % suppression ) . Quantitative RT PCR analysis has revealed again that NF2 - N transfectants express both NF2 - N ( Fig . 3 ) and v - Ha - Ras ( data not known ) , clearly indicating that reduction of Ras - induced malignancy is due to NF2 - N expression and not due to a loss of v - Ha - Ras expression . These observations confirmed our prediction that the anti - Ras function of NF2 resides in part in its highly conserved N - ter - minal half , which most likely binds actin filaments ( F - actin ) . NF2 mRNA Level Is Not Affected by v - Ha - Ras - Expression of the four distinct tumor suppressor genes encoding actin cy - toskeleton - associated proteins ( vinculin , a - actinin , gelsolin , and tropomyosin - l ) , which can suppress SV40 - or Ras - induced malignancies , are down - regulated by either SV40 virus or on - cogenic Ras mutants ( 14 ) . Thus , we have compared the steady - state levels of NF2 mRNA between normal and v - Ha - Ras - transformed mouse NIW3T3 cells by a quantitative RT PCR technique using a pair of oligonucleotide primers , B ( antisense ) and S ( sense ) , that can amplify both mouse and human NF2 cDNAs ( for detail , see “Experimental Procedures” ) . As shown in Fig . 3 ( right panel ) , no significant difference in the NF2 mes - sage level could be detected between normal ( N ) and Ras - trans - formed ( 2‘ ) cells , and the endogenous ( mouse ) NF2 mRNA level in both cases is far lower than the exogenous ( human ) NF2 - N mRNAleve1 in NF2 - N transfectants ( R ) , clearly indicating that v - Ha - Ras does not affect the steady - state level of NF2 mRNAs . Using another pair of primers , A ( antisense ) and S , which could amplify the exogenous ( human ) NF2 message of 1 . 0 kb in NF2 - N transfectants ( R , l - R4 ) but not the endogenous ( mouse ) NF2 cDNAs in either normal cells ( N ) or Ras transformants ( 2’ ) ( Fig . 3 , left panel ) , we have confirmed that the 1 . 1 - kb PCR R T N S The human NF2 - N mRNAs could be detected only in NFP - N - transfected FIG . 3 .

The deduced human and mouse NF2 amino acid sequences are 98 % identical ( 20 , 21 ) . DISCUSSION We have shown here that both full - length NF2 and its N - terminal half ( NF2 - N ) can reverse the malignant phenotype induced by an oncogenic Ras mutant , but full anti - Ras action of NF2 seems to require its C - terminal half ( NF2 - C ) as well . The partial requirement of NF2 - C for full anti - oncogenicity appears to be compatible with previous observations that majority of mutations associated with neurofibromatosis 2 cause C - termi - nal truncations ( 7 , 8 ) , suggesting that the C - terminal domain is required for a potential tumor suppressor activity of NF2 . In fact , our preliminary results indicate that an NF2 - C fragment ( residues 354 - 595 ) is anti - oncogenic as NF2 - N . 2 Interestingly , one NF2 patient , represented by cell line GUS5722 ( 7 ) , was found to carry an NF2 mutant that lacks 78 amino acids ( resi - dues 447 - 524 ) in the C - terminal domain ( 7 ) . This missing do - main contains two slightly overlapping Pro - rich decapeptide motifs ( residues 478 - 495 ) , which potentially could bind SH3 domains of some intracellular signal transducers such as the N - terminal domain of GAP1 ( a Ras GTPase - activating protein of 120 kDa ) and the C termini of myosin Is ( single - headed myosin isoenzymes ) . The domain NF2 - N is highly homologous to several other members of the TERM family of F - actin - binding proteins ( 7 , 8 ) . In fact , our preliminary results indicate that NF2 - N at least co - sediments with purified F - actin in Thus , it appears that NF2 belongs to a tumor suppressor family of actin - cy - toskeleton - associated proteins ( ACAPs ) . This family includes at least four other ACAPs , i . e . vinculin , a - actinin , tropomyo - sin - 1 , and gelsolin ( 12 - 15 ) . However , it still remains to be clari - fied whether their F - actin binding is absolutely required for their anti - oncogenicity . How do these actin - binding proteins block the oncogenic Ras signal transduction pathway ? It was conceivable that expression of NF2 gene , like other members of this tumor suppressor gene family , could be suppressed by v - ’ A . Tikoo and H . Maruta , unpublished observations . ‘A . Tikoo and H . Maruta , unpublished observation . 23390 NF2 Suppresses Ras - Ha - Ras , and the constitutive expression of NF2 gene might be necessary to modulate the action of the Ras mutant . However , we have demonstrated here that v - Ha - Ras does not affect steady - state levels of NF2 mRNAs in NIW3T3 cells . Alterna - tively , NF2 overexpression could lead to overproduction of actin or other ACAPs , which in turn suppress Ras - induced malig - nant transformation . Interestingly , it was recently reported that overexpression of the serum - responsive factor , which ac - tivates a - actin gene , can also suppress Ras - induced malignant transformation of NIW3T3 cells ( 24 ) . Thus , we are currently examining levels of actin and other F - actin - binding proteins in NF2 transfectants . It is equally possible that the NF2 - F - actin complex might bind either Ras or one of the downstream tar - gets of Ras ( Raf , MAP kinase , MEK ( M A P kinase kinase ) , or a target farther downstream ) , and therefore it could block the Ras - target interaction as small fragments of NF1 and N - termi - nal domain of Raf ( FJ ) . ~ Thus , we are currently trying to find out which step of Ras signal transduction pathway ( or kinase cas - cade ) is blocked by NF2 . An interaction of Ras with F - actin itself or an actin - contain - ing complex has been observed previously ( 25 ) . Interestingly , it was demonstrated recently that a key role of Ras - GTP complex in Raf - induced activation of MEK is to recruit cytoplasmic Sed Thr kinase Raf to the cytoskeleton ( a detergent - insoluble frac - tion ) located underneath the plasma membranes where activa - tion of Raf takes place ( 26 ) , but the nature of this cytoskeleton still remains to be determined . A rapid disruption of F - actin stress fibers ( but neither microtubules nor intermediate fila - ments ) is one of the early intracellular events that follow ma - lignant transformation induced by SV40 virus , Ras , or other oncogenes ( 27 ) . Overexpression of an N - terminal domain of GAP1 ( GAPlN , residues 1 - 445 ) , which contains a pair of SH2 domains and a single SH3 domain , also causes disruption of actin stress fibers ( 28 ) . These observations indicate that GAPlN acts as a downstream target of Ras in this intracellular event and suggest the possibility that actin - cytoskeleton plays a key role in regulation of Ras - induced activation of Raf . In this context , it is of interest to note that ( i ) another mo - nomeric G protein ( or GTPase ) called Rho is required for orga - nization of F - actin stress fibers ( 291 , and ( ii ) p190 , a GAP spe - cific for Rho , directly interacts with GAPlN ( 22 , 30 , 31 ) . GAPlN binds p190 only when p190 is phosphorylated at spe - cific tyrosine residues ( 22 ) . p190 activates Rho GTPase through its C - terminal domain ( 23 , 31 ) ; however , it is possible that its N - terminal domain , which contains a G protein or GTPase motif , might act as a GTP - activated signal transducer as Ras and Rho ( 30 ) . Perhaps p190 acts as a downstream target of Rho for organizing actin stress fibers and GAPlN somehow inter - feres with the action of p190 by forming a complex with tyro - sine - phosphorylated p190 . NF2 and other actin - binding tumor suppressors might serve as the downstream targets of p190 or form a complex with GAPlN , thereby interfering with GAF ' lN - p190 interaction to antagonize the oncogenic action of Ras mutants .
