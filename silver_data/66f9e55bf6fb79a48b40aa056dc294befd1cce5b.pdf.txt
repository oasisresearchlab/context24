A cell is able to sense the biomechanical properties of the environment such as the rigidity of the extracellular matrix and adapt its tension via regulation of plasma membrane and underlying actomyosin meshwork properties . The cell ' s ability to adapt to the changing biomechanical envi - ronment is important for cellular homeostasis and also cell dynamics such as cell growth and motility . Membrane trafficking has emerged as an important mechanism to regulate cell biome - chanics . In this review , we summarize the current understanding of the role of cell mechanics in exocytosis , and reciprocally , the role of exocytosis in regulating cell mechanics . We also discuss how cell mechanics and membrane trafficking , particularly exocytosis , can work together to reg - ulate cell polarity and motility . 1 | INTRODUCTION From cell spreading to the secretion of proteins and small molecules , many cellular processes require exocytosis , the process through which a cell fuses the lipidic bilayers of an intracellular organelle and the plasma membrane ( PM ) and release the luminal material into the extracellular space . The PM physically separates the interior of the cell from its extracellular environment , and at the same time , serves as a platform to mediate communication with the cell environment . Released vesicular contents such as neurotransmitter , hormones and exosomes , allow for cell communication in autocrine and paracrine manners . 1 Deposition of extracellular matrix protein and metallopro - tease further allows cells to actively remodel their environment . 2 , 3 In addition to secretion of molecules , exocytosis also brings to the PM intrinsic components of such as lipids and membrane - associated proteins , 1 which can impact cellular physiology , for instance , by regu - lating cytoskeleton dynamics , as in the case of receptors . 4 Transmem - brane receptor proteins such as receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) and integrins recognize extracellular ligands and sense both the chemical and mechanical properties of the environment , which are the molecu - lar bases of chemotaxis , and then send intracellular signals allowing for cell adaptation to the environment . 5 , 6 Because the boundary of the cell is limited by the PM , the fusion of a vesicle increases the apparent surface of the PM and allows the cell to spread and grow . On the other hand , changes in membrane shape and surface influence the mechanical properties of the mem - brane such as lateral stretching - compression tensions . Increasing evi - dence shows that the mechanical properties of the membrane , such as membrane tension , also play important roles in regulating mem - brane trafficking and cytoskeleton dynamics . 7 , 8 In this review , we will focus on the molecular mechanisms which govern how biomechanical cues transduced in the cell can influence exocytosis and reciprocal regulation of cellular biomechanics by exo - cytosis . We will first discuss the major biomechanical properties of the cell , then the interplay between cellular mechanics and exocytosis , and finally how membrane trafficking and cellular mechanics co - ordinate to regulate cell polarity and motility . 1 . 1 | Tensions in the cell Cells are constantly under various mechanical stresses that constitu - tively generated by the cell itself as well as the surrounding environ - ment . Here , we focus on the major inner forces related to the PM . The PM is composed of a lipid bilayer equipped with integral and peripheral proteins . The underlying molecular scaffolds of PM recep - tors and actin meshwork are closely connected to these elements . The biomechanical properties of the PM depend on all of the above - mentioned elements . If we considered the PM only as a 2D fluid lipid bilayer with proteins anchored undergoing lateral diffusion , 9 then its biomechanical properties should be those of the lipid bilayer , with negligible contribution of proteins . The in - plane surface tension of lipid bilayer , referred to as membrane tension , takes into account the stretching - compression elastic stresses at every point along the mem - brane surface . 10 Because its integrity is maintained by intermolecular forces , a membrane has very low lateral elasticity and could not be expanded more than 3 % to 5 % without rupture . 8 , 11 Membrane Received : 8 April 2018 Revised and accepted : 3 June 2018 Uncorrected manuscript published : 25 June 2018 Published on : 19 July 2018 DOI : 10 . 1111 / tra . 12584 © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A / S . Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Traffic . 2018 ; 19 : 741 – 749 . wileyonlinelibrary . com / journal / tra 741 tension in different cell types cover a wide range from 3 to ~ 300 pN / μ m in physiological condition , far from the rupture value of 3000 to 10 000 pN / μ m . 8 , 11 Except in blebs , the PM is in tight interaction with the underlying cortical actomyosin meshwork . In the “ Fence and Picket ” model , the underlying membrane cytoskeleton physically confines the membrane into small compartments and limits protein diffusion between these compartments . 12 The membrane cytoskeleton directly applies forces on the PM via lipid binding proteins . 13 The term cortical tension refers to the contractile force within the juxta - membrane cortical actin meshwork without the membrane . Both the myosin contraction and the structural rigidity of actin architecture contribute to the cortical tension . In most cases , it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of the in - plane surface tension of the PM ' s lipid bilayer , henceforth referred to as membrane tension and the tension generated by the subcortical cytoskeleton in current tension detection methods , as dis - cussed by Sens and Plastino . 8 The term cell tension thus corresponds to the complex addition of membrane tension and cortical tension . The third level of force comes from the cytoskeletal elements located deeper in the cell . Actomyosin contractility exerts mechanical tension to the outside of the cell through cell - extracellular adhesion or cell - cell adhesion . This mechanical tension is often described as a traction force , which refers to the pulling force exerted on a one - dimensional continuum and it is in the range of pN to nN . 14 Both actin polymerization and myosin contraction contribute to the generation of this out - going force . When actin filaments polymerize against the membrane , for example , at the leading edge of a migrating cell , the existing actin cytoskeleton is pushed backward and generate a retro - grade actin flow which has been shown to supply the force for the growth of focal adhesion . 15 Stress fibers are long actin bundles anchored to integrin - based focal adhesion site . The intracellular con - tractile tension generated by myosin on stress fibers can be transmit - ted on a long scale across the cell and to the external substrate through integrins , and extracellular forces could conversely transduce signals into the cell via integrins . 16 , 17 2 | MEMBRANE TENSION The membrane is , to a large extent fluid , which means that lipid and integral proteins are able to move laterally in the bilayer as discussed above . 9 Because lipids can flow from the low - tension area toward the high - tension area , a gradient of tension could potentially be dissipated by the membrane alone at steady state in an immobile cell . 10 This principle is at the basis of the use of the tether pulling technique to probe membrane tension . 2 Membrane tension changes in dynamic cells or depending on changes in the environment . There are four major origins of membrane tension modifications : ( 1 ) exocytosis which decreases membrane tension and endocytosis which increases it ( see below ) , ( 2 ) a difference in hydrostatic pressure between the cytosol and the external medium ; ( 3 ) adhesion and interaction with the cyto - skeleton , which is dynamic and exerts pulling forces on the membrane to produce cell motion and local membrane shape change , and ( 4 ) stretching forces in the membrane resulting from the change of the cell ' s apparent surface - to - volume ratio , for example , during cell spreading on substrate and compression by external force . Different techniques have been developed to experimentally con - trol cell membrane tension on the basis of the nature of tension . The first approach consists of applying mechanical pressure on the mem - brane of static cells . The most commonly applied method is an osmotic shock that changes the extracellular osmotic pressure . 18 Mechanically stretching the cell can also increase membrane ten - sion . 19 The second approach is to artificially change the PM surface by fusion of unilamellar liposomes to the cell to decrease tension 20 or by micropipette aspiration to retrieve membrane and increase ten - sion . 21 The third way is to change the surface - to - volume ratio by allowing cell to adhere to 22 or detach from 23 the substrate . It is also possible to change the tension by modifying the composition of the membrane with amphiphilic compounds such as deoxycholate which decreases membrane tension . 24 , 25 Because one major source of mem - brane tension is the actomyosin contractile force , genetic or pharma - ceutical perturbation of Myosin I 26 , 27 or Myosin II activity 28 – 30 can decrease membrane tension . Conversely , over - expressing Myosin I 27 or stabilizing actin filaments 28 have the opposite effects . Following the definition of these basic properties of cell tension , we will focus on reviewing the current knowledge on the contribution of exocytosis to cell tension and the regulation of exocytosis by cell tension . 2 . 1 | Membrane tension and exocytosis A model describing how tension might regulate exocytosis and endo - cytosis to promote homeostasis has been proposed 7 : increased ten - sion favors exocytosis to bring the additional amount of lipids and proteins to allow the expansion of surface area whereas decreased tension favors endocytosis to remove the excess membrane from the surface . However , migrating , dividing , spreading and growing cells have a PM clearly out of equilibrium globally ( in the case of growth , division and spreading ) or locally ( in the case of migration ) in compari - son to the cell at steady state , with endocytosis compensating for exocytosis , which may create an apparent equilibrium ( Figure 1A ) . How membrane tension is regulated in such dynamic cell states has been the matter of recent intensive research . In migrating cells , the total cell surface is constant but endocytosis is stronger in the rear of the cell whereas exocytosis mainly occurs of the leading edge ( Figure 1B ) . 31 It was proposed that this differential regulation is due to differences in cell tension from the trailing edge to the leading edge of the cell . 21 , 32 During spreading ( Figure 1C ) , the surface of membrane shows a net increase in different cells types . 22 , 33 – 35 Cell spreading can be divided into two phases : ( 1 ) a myosin contraction - free phase , during which cells use PM reservoirs in invaginations and ruffles to increase the surface area , and ( 2 ) a contractile spreading phase , during which myosin contraction was observed , following a transient increase in membrane tension and was accompanied by massive exocytosis . 36 In fibroblasts and macrophages , the first phase lasts less than 1 minute and the second phase can last more than 15 minutes . 22 , 35 Moreover , tension decreases during cell flattening and the peak appears at the transition between the two phases . 22 This indicates that the PM and 742 WANG AND GALLI endosomal reservoirs can efficiently supply the membrane needed to buffer membrane tension changes . In certain cell types such as muscle cells , caveolae , which flatten when tension increases , have been shown to be a reservoir of PM . 37 The amount of membrane supplied by exocytosis was estimated to be 40 % to 60 % of the total PM area . 35 Similarly , during phagocytosis ( Figure 1D ) in macrophages , pseu - dopods of membranes grow over the surface of the target particles . 38 The extension of pseudopod can also be divided into two phases : ( 1 ) an exocytosis free phase where the cell uses preexisting mem - branes for engulfment until the reservoir is depleted ; and ( 2 ) an exocytosis - dependent extension where increased membrane tension co - ordinates exocytosis to recruit more membrane to expand and close the engulfment . Both early endosomal 36 and late endosomal / lysosomal 39 compartments were shown to contribute pseudopod growth in phagocytosis .

A , At steady state , endocytosis and exocytosis are balanced . B , During cell migration , exocytosis occurs in the leading edge , decreases membrane tension ( Tm ) , and allows actin polymerization ; endocytosis removes membrane from the trailing edge , increases membrane tension and depolymerizes actin cytoskeleton . C , During the first phase of cell spreading , cell uses membrane reservoir at the PM to spread . Upon depletion of the surface reservoir , a sudden increase of Tm triggers exocytosis to enlarge PM surface . D , During phagocytosis , cell firstly uses PM reservoir to engulf the target object , and then use exocytosis to further expand engulfment . E , During axonal growth , exocytosis brings materials for neuron extension to the PM of the growth cone , resulting in a retrograde membrane flow in the PM of axon . F , During axon turning , endocytosis removes membrane from the repulsion site , resulting in an increase of Tm and depolymerization of actin cytoskeleton , while at the attraction side , exocytosis enlarges membrane area which decreases Tm and allows actin polymerization WANG AND GALLI 743 A sudden increase of membrane tension by a hypoosmotic shock triggers the transition from phase 1 to phase 2 previously discussed in the context of cell spreading 22 and phagocytosis . 38 In plant cells , despite turgor pressure , hyperosmotic shock increases clathrin - mediated endocytosis and simultaneously attenuates exocytosis , whereas hypoosmotic treatments have the opposite effects . 40 Hyper - osmotic shock further decreases the rate of full fusion but increases the rate of stay fusion , the persistent presence of fusion - generated Ω - profiles ( see section 2 . 3 ) , in the chromaffin cell . 41 We recently found decreased exocytosis of early endosomal , and lysosomal secre - tory vesicles following hyperosmotic shock in fibroblasts . 42 Hyperos - motic pressure instantaneously ( in less than 1 minute ) and reversibly reduced the rate of exocytosis . 42 Altogether , there is significant evidence to support the notion that exocytosis and endocytosis are regulated by cell tension and this parameter needs to be taken into consideration together with the well - established contribution of actomyosin . 2 . 2 | Membrane tension and membrane fusion The first way through which higher membrane tension could facilitate exocytosis is via lipid packing , by increasing the exposure of hydro - phobic tails of the lipids 43 , 44 and thereby reducing the energy barrier required to break the integrity of lipid bilayers and facilitate mem - brane fusion . The fusion of membrane is mediated by v - and t - SNAREs which progressively assemble into a four - helix bundle , from the cytosolic N - terminal regions toward the membrane - anchored C - terminal ends . 45 This generates an inward force to pull the membrane together . In model membranes , the energy required for activating the fusion of lipid bilayers is ~ 50 k B T , 46 , 47 where k B is Boltzmann ' s constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin . The zippering energy contributed by a single SNAREpin varies in different studies . 48 It is reported to be 19 k B T by using isothermal titration calorimetry , 49 35 k B T by surface forces apparatus ( SFA ) 50 and 68 k B T by optical tweezers . 51 Using an assay of v - SNARE nanodisc fusing with a t - SNARE liposome , one SNARE complex was shown to be sufficient to induce membrane fusion . 52 , 53 Increasing the number of SNARE copies leads to an increase in fusion pore size and keeps the fusion pore open for a physiologically relevant time . 52 – 54 By visualizing synaptic fusion using fluorescent - tagged VAMP2 , a v - SNARE , it has been shown that at least two SNARE complexes are needed for synaptic vesicle fusion in cultured hippocampal neurons . 55 Synaptic vesicles have an outer diameter range of 35 to 45 nm 56 and contain around 70 copies of VAMP2 . 57 At the acceptor membrane , syntaxins , which , with SNAP - 25 , constitute synaptic t - SNAREs , form clusters of a diameter of 50 to 60 nm , containing on average 75 densely crowded syntaxins that dynamically exchange with freely diffusing molecules . 58 This suggests that cells maintain a high concen - tration of SNARE proteins to assure efficient and timely fusion at spe - cific sites , particularly in neurons where the timing and efficiency of neurotransmitter is crucial for neural activity . 59 Mathematical simulation of small vesicles ( 28 nm diameter ) fusing to planar membrane shows that high tension increase membrane fusion rate and the tensions on both membranes should both be high enough to induce a successful fusion . 60 , 61 A study using model membrane fusion machinery consisting of syntaxin 1 , VAMP2 and SNAP25 , shows that vesicles have a higher fusion rate to an acceptor membrane having increased in - plane tension , either by stretching a planar lipid bilayer on a dilatable polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) sheet or stretching a giant uni - lamellar vesicle ( GUV ) by docking onto a flat surface . 62 Therefore , at the nanoscopic scale of SNARE - mediated mem - brane fusion , membrane tension is likely a force counteracting pore opening . The current state of the art suggests that the number of SNARE complexes would regulate pore opening . Regulation of pore - opening via lipid modifications affecting membrane tension during docking and fusion still needs investigation . 2 . 3 | Membrane tension and fusion pore The membrane fusion process was described to follow two modes : ( 1 ) in the first , the fusion pore expands until full flattening of the vesicular membrane into the target membrane , that is , full fusion or collapse fusion mode ; ( 2 ) in the second , the fusion pore opens and then closes transiently , and the vesicle stays intact , corresponding to a kiss - and - run fusion mode . These models are especially relevant for small vesicles as ~ 40 nm synaptic vesicles . 63 , 64 In larger size vesicles as ~ 300 nm dense - core vesicles of chromaffin cells , vesicles can also undergo “ kiss - and - stay ” 65 : after fusion pore opening , the vesicle keeps a Ω - shaped structure or Ω - profile on maintaining the pore opened for seconds to tens of seconds . The Ω - profile can then shrink until full collapse ( termed collapse fusion ) or shrink or enlarge in size and close the pore sometime after fusion . The Ω - profile model is more relevant to a membrane under tension . Because of the fluidic nature of the membrane , lipids can flow through the fusion pore from the low - tension membrane to the high - tension membrane . 66 , 67 In chromaffin cells , dynamic assembly of cortical actin contributes to the exocytosis of dense - core vesicles by providing sufficient mem - brane tension to mediate Ω - profile shrinking and vesicle collapse . 41 Depletion of actin decreases the probability of vesicle undergoing full collapse but has no effect on the closing of the fusion pore . 41 In PC12 cells , myosin II activity prolongs the release kinetics of tPA ( tissue plasminogen activator ) and BDNF ( brain - derived neurotrophic factor ) as seen using phluorin - based live cell imaging , but the authors did not detect any difference in NPY ( neuropeptide Y ) and insulin release . 68 Myosin II activity also prolongs the overall VAMP2 - mediated exocyto - sis and increases the amount of tPA released into the medium but not NPY . 68 This can be explained by the fact that the release kinetics of tPA ( ~ 10s ) and BDNF ( ~ 60s ) are much slower than that of NPY and insulin ( < 2 seconds ) , which are beyond the resolution in time of the author ' s detection system . By using pHluorin imaging and amperome - try , myosin force was shown to drive to the enlargement of the fusion pore and vesicle collapse of NPY vesicles in human carcinoid BON cells . 29 Abolishing Cdc42 activity also decreases the rate of full fusion and increases kiss - and - run events and reduces the diameter of the nascent fusion pore and the release speed of contents . 29 A constitu - tively active form of Cdc42 strongly stimulates VAMP7 exocytosis , 69 in an actin - dependent manner , 70 further generalizing the notion that actin dynamics may differentially regulate exocytosis of different types of vesicles . 744 WANG AND GALLI Cortical tension has been shown to be important in several differ - ent cell types in the secretion of large ( 1 - 5 μ m in diameter ) secretory granules ( reviewed in Reference 71 ) . During granular exocytosis , acto - myosin coats associate with the surface of exocytic granules and con - tribute directly to content release by supplying contraction force to expel secretory protein directly from fused organelles , or by stabilizing the fusing granule and preventing pore closure . 71 However , mem - brane tension was not considered in these studies . Early studies show that mast cell secretory granule has a higher membrane tension than the PM and upon fusion , there is backflow of lipids into the gran - ule . 72 , 73 More recently , it was shown that pore expansion is controlled by F - actin - dependent membrane tension . 74 These observations sug - gest that actomyosin contraction is required to counteract the swell - ing of the granule for efficient content release . Thus , we conclude that , after the initiation of membrane docking and fusion , membrane tension controlled by cortical actin likely regu - lates the dynamics of the fusion pore and the release of vesicular con - tents . The precise local effect of actin dynamics on membrane tension at fusion sites still requires further investigation . 3 | CORTICAL TENSION AND LATE - ENDOSOMAL AND LYSOSOMAL EXOCYTOSIS Cortical tension is intimately connected to integrin signaling . The matu - ration of focal adhesions , especially the early steps , is dependent on the contraction force generated by cortical actomyosin . 5 In turn , activated integrin signaling reinforces actin network and myosin contractility , thus , increases cortical tension . 8 In addition , focal adhesion signaling may control vesicular transport by regulating cytoskeleton organization , cell polarity and motor protein activity . 75 , 76 Reciprocally , endosomal trafficking controls the delivery of newly synthesized integrin , 77 the recycling of integrin 78 and turnover of focal adhesion sites . 79 In good agreement , substrate rigidity regulates VAMP7 - mediated late - endosomal / lysosomal exocytosis in fibroblasts in an integrin - dependent manner . On laminin , but not polylysine - coated soft gels , VAMP7 exocytosis increases with the increase in substrate rigidity . VPS9 - ankyrin - repeat protein ( VARP , also known as ANKRD27 ) and leucine rich repeat kinase 1 ( LRRK1 ) are VAMP7 - binding partners . VARP is a Rab21 guanine nucleotide exchange factor which interacts with kinesin and regulates the transport of VAMP7 from cell center to cell periphery 80 , 81 VARP also interacts with the retromer and regulates the transport of the glucose transporter Glut1 to the cell surface . 82 LRRK1 interacts with dynein and regulates the transport of EGF - containing endosomes 83 – 85 and VAMP7 from the cell periphery to cell center . 42 Rigid substrate enhances the activity of VARP and the positioning of lysosomes in the cell periphery . 42 Integrin - dependent adhesion was also shown to positively regulate VAMP7 exocytosis in neurons . 86 Thus , integrin - mediated sensing of the cell environment is involved in the regulation of exocytosis . Interestingly , cells lacking VAMP7 have shown a defect in mechano - adaptation that adapt the elasticity of the cell cortex to the rigidity of the environment . 42 Interestingly , glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored - protein - enriched early endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) were shown to be the source of the intracellular reservoir which is mobilized for exocyto - sis in cell spreading . 22 , 35 Interestingly enough , GEECs have a lipid con - tent rich in glycosphingolipids which generates more ordered membrane microdomains 87 thus could allow the cell to adapt to the increased surface . The vesicular SNARE VAMP7 was shown to mediate the transport of PrPc , a GPI - anchored protein to the cell surface and its knockout leads to the impaired cellular content of different ganglioside monosialic acid 3 ( GM3 ) species containing long ( C16 - 18 ) or very long acyl chain ( C ≥ 20 , VLC ) , and very long sphingomyelin ( SM ) with a pref - erential channeling of very long chain ceramides precursors to form VLC - GM3 and concomitant reduction of VLC - SM in VAMP7 - knockout fibroblasts . 88 Thus , the VAMP7 knockout was hypothesized to carry defective biomechanical properties , a hypothesis supported by our recent data . 42 Altogether , we conclude that integrin sensing of the cell environ - ment , particularly rigidity , likely regulates the exocytosis of endo - somes which could bring specific sets of lipids and proteins which could allow the cell to adapt to an increased surface area ( Figure 2 ) . Direct investigation of the contribution of specific lipid content of secretory vesicles in cell adaptation to the mechanical properties of the environment will require further investigation . 4 | CELL TENSION AND POLARITY Directed cell migration is guided by sensing of a local gradient of con - centration of chemical factors , referred to as chemotaxis , or mechani - cal factors such as external forces or gradients in substrate rigidity referred to as mechanotaxis . 89 It is well accepted that the polarized trafficking of membrane receptors and adhesion molecules is impor - tant for cell motility . 90 , 91 In the last years , cell tension has emerged as a major player in controlling cell polarity and migration . At the cell boundary , actin polymerization works against the cell barrier , the PM , and suffers the resistance from membrane tension . 8 Both simulations and experimental approaches show that the hetero - geneity of local membrane tension along the longitudinal cell axis plays a crucial role in cell migration . 7 , 21 , 32 , 92 – 96 Current consensus suggests that membrane tension is a master cell shape regulator and is required for establishing cell polarity by inhibiting actin polymeriza - tion . When membrane tension is low in the cell , multiple lamellipodia can coexist and no polarity is established . When membrane tension increases because of actin filament polymerization , smaller protru - sions are progressively suppressed and finally , one main lamellipodia remains . When tension further increases such as during mitosis or by micropipette aspiration , the tension overloads the lamellipodia and cell polarity is canceled . In addition to cargo transport , membrane traf - ficking in this context can be a major contributor to the regulation of local membrane tension as exocytosis enlarges membrane surface and reduces membrane tension to allow actin polymerization , and endocy - tosis helps to remove lipids and increase membrane tension as dis - cussed above . 7 Cell migration and axon growth ( Figure 1E ) and guidance ( Figure 1F ) share many common molecular mechanisms . 97 A major dif - ference , however , is that during neuronal growth , the cell surface undergoes massive expansion which requires a continuous excess of WANG AND GALLI 745 exocytosis over endocytosis . 98 Among the largest and most complex metazoan cells , the axon can elongate at an average rate of 0 . 5 mm per day , the volume of cell grows by 0 . 6 % , while PM surface area increases by 20 % . 98 The effect of cell tension in axon dynamics has not yet been addressed in detail . Using the membrane tethering tech - nique , an early study shows that membrane flowed from the low ten - sion growth cone ( 5 . 26 pN ) to the high tension cell body ( 7 . 61 pN ) in chick dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons in culture , suggesting that the source of axon outgrowth originates from the growth cone , 99 in good agreement with previous reports showing that newly synthe - sized membrane protein is preferentially incorporated at axonal growth cones . 100 Interestingly , in a study using calibrated glass nee - dles to exert a constant force on elongating axons of cultured sensory neurons , the authors show that axon growth speed increased when tether force increased . 101 By using the same technique , another study shows that the axon growth speed further increased after hypoosmo - tic treatment . 102 These results suggest that the increase in membrane tension could be a signal for axonal extension , and we would like to propose a stimulatory effect of membrane tension on exocytosis in the growth cone . It could also be hypothesized that when the growth cone encounters a target and forms a synapse , then PM tension could be lowered thus preventing further extension . Exocytosis and endocytosis also play crucial roles in growth cone chemotaxis . 103 – 107 It has been suggested that axon turning is medi - ated by an asymmetric balance of exocytosis in the attraction side and endocytosis in the repulsion side . 108 – 110 For instance , Semaphorin - 3A repulsion inhibits VAMP2 - mediated exocytosis 103 and triggers clathrin - dependent endocytosis . 104 The attractive signal cAMP is able to induce VAMP7 - exocytosis in the attraction side and the repulsive cGMP induces VAMP7 - exocytosis in the opposite side . 105 Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that membrane tension could be a master regulator of axon turning , which associate the pro - posed membrane trafficking - dependent turning model 110 with cyto - skeletal dynamics . 111 Similar to the migrating cell ( Figure 1B ) , exocytosis lowers the membrane tension and favors actin filament assembly and growth cone spreading , while endocytosis increases membrane tension and a depolymerized cytoskeleton . As exocytosis is a prerequisite in growing axons , an asymmetric distribution of exo - cytosis or endocytosis would induce a gradient of membrane tension perpendicular to the axis of extension and shift the lamellipodia to one side of the axis ( Figure 1F ) . How membrane tension could operate during the development of the nervous system requires in vivo investigation . 5 | CONCLUSION In conclusion , the biomechanical properties and behavior of cells affect several steps of exocytosis , from directed vesicle transport on actin cables to membrane fusion and fusion pore opening . Vice - versa , membrane trafficking is at the same time both a regulator and effector of cell tension . On one hand , membrane tension and membrane traf - ficking can build a negative feedback loop between the high mem - brane tension and the increase of exocytosis which reduce the membrane tension to maintain the homeostasis ( steady state ) or bring an unbalanced system back to steady state ( spreading and phagocyto - sis ) . On the other hand , they can also work against homeostasis by an active process through which exocytosis and / or endocytosis create a local gradient of membrane tension ( between the front and the rear side of migrating cells , growth cone and cell body of growing neurons , attraction side and the retraction side of turning axons ) and promote other cellular activities including as actin polymerization . The feedback loop and cooperation between membrane tension and membrane traf - ficking might explain common molecular mechanisms of cell dynamics seen in growth , spreading , migration and axon guidance . However , the precise signaling mechanism of by which mechani - cal signals of rigidity and tension are transmitted to the membrane trafficking system is still unclear . A strong candidate to fill the gap is the family of focal adhesion proteins which have shown the ability to mobilize the exocytotic vesicle pool . The underlying molecular mecha - nism is indeed a subject deserving further investigation to unravel the precise signaling pathways linking biomechanical constraint sensing and intracellular membrane trafficking .

C , Integrin signaling triggers VAMP7 - mediated late endosomal and lysosomal exocytosis . D , VAMP7 - mediated exocytosis brings raft lipids and proteins from Golgi to the PM 746 WANG AND GALLI such as Piezo may also play a role in the detection and intracellular transduction of mechanical constraints . 112 Further investigation is needed to establish the links between signaling pathways and exocy - tosis and endocytosis . Another important question is the precise contribution of exocy - tosis to cell mechanics . Exocytosis brings lipids and refreshes mem - brane receptors , but is the vesicular content ( both lipids and proteins ) specifically regulated depending on mechanical constraints ? An attrac - tive hypothesis would be that under high tension , vesicles selectively bring lipids structurally best fit to such tension , tension sensors for a timely monitoring of tension change , and mechanosensitive channel to profit the high tension . Further studies aimed at identifying the pre - cise contribution of the different types of secretory vesicles to the cell response to biomechanical constraints needs to be carried out . We have not discussed here the role of endocytosis and endoculum reticulum ( ER ) - PM contact sites in the cell response to bio - mechanical cues and their reciprocal regulation of PM tension , but these contributions to the general question raised in this review need to be addressed in future reviews .
