To understand how F - BAR proteins achieve their PM association , we studied the localization of a Schizo - saccharomyces pombe F - BAR protein Rga7 , which requires the coiled - coil protein Rng10 for targeting to the division site during cytokinesis . We ﬁnd that the Rga7 F - BAR domain directly binds a motif in Rng10 simultaneously with the PM , and that an adja - cent Rng10 motif independently binds the PM . Together , these multivalent interactions signiﬁcantly enhance Rga7 F - BAR avidity for membranes at phys - iological protein concentrations , ensuring the division site localization of Rga7 . Moreover , the requirement for the F - BAR domain in Rga7 localization and func - tion in cytokinesis is bypassed by tethering an Rga7 construct lacking its F - BAR to Rng10 , indicating that at least some F - BAR domains are necessary but not sufﬁcient for PM targeting and are stably localized to speciﬁc cortical positions through adaptor proteins . INTRODUCTION The F - BAR ( Fer / CIP4 homology - Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ) - domain superfamily broadly functions to link the plasma membrane ( PM ) to the actin cytoskeleton ( Liu et al . , 2015 ; Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2010 ; Salzer et al . , 2017 ) . As such , F - BAR proteins play major roles in membrane trafﬁcking , cell morphology , cell motility , and cell division . Membrane binding is an intrinsic property of all F - BAR do - mains ( Begonja et al . , 2015 ; Frost et al . , 2009 ; Itoh and Taken - awa , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2015 ; Takeda et al . , 2013 ) . These domains homodimerize to form crescent - shaped or ﬂat modules that interact with anionic membranes with modest afﬁnity ( Al - meida - Souza et al . , 2018 ; Kelley et al . , 2015a ; Lefe ` bvre et al . , 2012 ; Moravcevic et al . , 2015 ; Soulard et al . , 2002 ) . F - BAR domains can achieve stronger avidity for membranes by homo - oligomerizing through tip - to - tip or tip - to - core interac - tions ( Frost et al . , 2009 ; McDonald et al . , 2015 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . The majority of F - BAR proteins contain only F - BAR domains for membrane binding , with the exception of Fes and Fer , which have an adjacent FX domain as a second membrane - binding module ( Itoh et al . , 2009 ) . Although interac - tion networks established through other domains such as SH3 , m HD , RhoGAP ( guanosine triphosphatase [ GTPase ] - acti - vating protein ) , tyrosine kinase , and C1 can inﬂuence discrete localizations ( Aspenstro¨m , 2009 ; Salzer et al . , 2017 ; Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2010 ) , in general , F - BAR proteins are thought to depend on the lipid binding of F - BAR domains for membrane association and proper intracellular targeting ( Frost et al . , 2009 ; McDonald and Gould , 2016b ; Mim and Unger , 2012 ; Qualmann et al . , 2011 ; Salzer et al . , 2017 ) . How F - BAR domains could mediate subcellular targeting is not clear , although several hypotheses have been suggested . One possi - bility is that F - BARs bind certain lipid head groups preferentially ( e . g . , phosphoinositides [ PIPs ] ) . However , few F - BAR domains contain speciﬁc PIP - binding pockets , and most are able to bind membranes with a wide range of compositions in vitro ( Frost et al . , 2009 ; Itoh and Takenawa , 2009 ; McDonald and Gould , 2016b ) . Another proposed localization mechanism is sensing subcellular membrane curvature ( Mim and Unger , 2012 ) . This hypothesis has seemed most relevant for F - BAR proteins involved in endocytosis , in which highly curved membrane intermediates are formed , and different F - BARs assemble on the budding vesicle in a deﬁned order ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . However , the localization timings do not correlate with the curvature of the F - BAR crescent ( Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) , and in vitro , these F - BAR domains bind to liposomes with varied membrane curvatures ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; McDonald and Gould , 2016b ) . Thus , it remains unclear mechanistically how most F - BAR proteins target to the correct subcellular localization . The Schizosaccharomyces pombe F - BAR protein Rga7 local - izes to the division site and functions during late cytokinesis ; rga7 mutants lyse at cell separation due to defective septa ( Ara - sada and Pollard , 2015 ; Liu et al . , 2016 ; Martı´n - Garcı´a et al . , 2540 Cell Reports 26 , 2540 – 2548 , March 5 , 2019 ª 2019 The Author ( s ) . This is an open access article under the CC BY - NC - ND license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by - nc - nd / 4 . 0 / ) . 2014 ) . While Rga7 function in cytokinesis requires its proline - rich middle region and a C - terminal RhoGAP domain in addition to its F - BAR domain , Rga7 localization requires its F - BAR domain and a binding partner , Rng10 ( Arasada and Pollard , 2015 ; Liu et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we report the molecular mechanism by which Rng10 cooperates with the Rga7 F - BAR domain to localize Rga7 to the PM of the division site . We ﬁnd that the Rga7 F - BAR domain , which binds phospholipids similarly to other F - BAR domains , also binds a motif within the Rng10 C terminus . An adjacent Rng10 motif provides a second membrane - binding module . The Rng10 - Rga7 complex has high membrane avidity , and complex formation is required for efﬁcient division site localiza - tion . This targeting mechanism provides an example in which an F - BAR domain binds the PM and a partner protein simulta - neously and suggests a novel mechanism by which F - BAR domains are recruited by coincident phospholipid and protein binding . As the majority of the BAR superfamily proteins contain only the F - BAR / BAR domains as a membrane - binding module ( Liu et al . , 2015 ; McDonald and Gould , 2016b ; Salzer et al . , 2017 ) , our ﬁndings reveal a missing mechanism whereby this low - afﬁnity module can achieve high - avidity binding with the PM and will inspire a search for F - BAR / BAR domain adaptors in other organisms . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Rng10 C Terminus Is Required for Division - Site Localization of the F - BAR Protein Rga7 Rga7 localization and function during septation requires the coiled - coil protein Rng10 ( Figure 1A ; Liu et al . , 2016 ) . We deﬁned the regions of Rng10 required for Rga7 localization . Rga7 local - ized to the division site and cell tips in all Rng10 N - terminal trun - cations tested ( Figures 1B and S1A ) , but failed to localize in Rng10 C - terminal truncations ( Figures 1B and S1B ) . Since Rga7 required minimally Rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) for colocalization to the pre - constriction ring , constricting ring , and a disk lining the septum at the division site ( Figures 1B and S1C ) , we concluded that the Rng10 C terminus is sufﬁcient to localize Rga7 . To conﬁrm that the Rng10 C terminus is sufﬁcient for Rga7 subcellular localization , we tested whether artiﬁcially mitochon - dria - localized Rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) could recruit Rga7 . The mito - chondrial outer membrane protein Tom20 was tagged with GFP - binding protein ( GBP ) ( Rothbauer et al . , 2008 ; Yamamoto et al . , 2011 ) in combination with monomeric EGFP ( mEGFP ) / mECitrine - tagged Rng10 constructs . The Rng10 constructs were robustly recruited to the mitochondria by Tom20 - GBP , while tdTomato , mScarlet - I , or mCherry tagged Rga7 were not ( Figure S1D ) . As predicted , Rng10 and Rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) , but not Rng10 ( 1 – 750 ) , recruited Rga7 to mitochondria ( Figure S1E ) . These data indicate that the Rng10 C terminus ( amino acids [ aa ] 751 – 1 , 038 ) is sufﬁcient to direct Rga7 to the division site . The Rng10 C Terminus Directly Interacts with the Rga7 F - BAR Domain to Regulate Rga7 Localization Because the Rga7 F - BAR domain ( aa 1 – 320 ) is sufﬁcient for Rga7 localization ( Arasada and Pollard , 2015 ) , we hypothesized that the F - BAR domain interacts with the Rng10 C terminus . Rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) localized not only full - length Rga7 but also the F - BAR domain alone ( Figure 1C ) . To test for a direct inter - action , we performed in vitro binding assays using recombinant Rng10 C terminus and the Rga7 F - BAR ( Figures 1D and S2A ) . GST - Rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) efﬁciently bound His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 – 320 ) with a dissociation constant ( K d ) of 0 . 43 m M ( Figures 1D , 1E , and S2B ) . F - BAR domains are typically obligate dimers that can oligomerize to form higher - order assemblies ( McDonald and Gould , 2016b ) . The Rga7 F - BAR is also a dimer , and the binding to Rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) does not appreciably affect Rga7 F - BAR oligomeric states ( Figure S2C ) . Deﬁning the Rga7 - binding motif within Rng10 further , we found that Rng10 ( 751 – 950 ) bound Rga7 ( 1 – 320 ) with a similar K d of 0 . 69 m M ( Figures 1F , 1G , and S2B ) , and Rng10 ( 751 – 950 ) could mistarget Rga7 to mitochondria ( Figures 1H and S1D ) . We conclude that Rng10 ( 751 – 950 ) interacts directly with the Rga7 F - BAR domain . The Rga7 F - BAR domain thus joins a growing list of F - BAR domains reported to bind directly to a second protein ; other examples include the F - BARs of S . pombe Cdc15 , Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hof1 , mammalian Pacsin2 , and human proline - serine - threonine phosphatase - in - teracting protein ( PSTPIP ) ( Hansen et al . , 2011 ; Senju et al . , 2011 ; Begonja et al . , 2015 ; Shoham et al . , 2003 ; Willet et al . , 2015 ; Garabedian et al . , 2018 ) . However , none of these previ - ously reported interactions are known to inﬂuence F - BAR pro - tein targeting , and therefore Rga7 emerges as an example in which binding of the F - BAR domain to a second protein regu - lates F - BAR protein localization . The Rng10 C Terminus Also Contains a Membrane - Binding Motif Although the tail of Rng10 C terminus ( aa 951 – 1 , 038 ) is dispens - able for the Rng10 - Rga7 interaction in vitro ( Figures 1F and S2D ) , it is crucial for Rga7 localization in vivo ( Figure 2A ) . Rga7 levels at the pre - constriction ring , the constricting ring , and as a disk lin - ing the septum were similar to wild - type ( WT ) in rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) cells but reduced signiﬁcantly in rng10 ( 751 – 950 ) and in rng10 ( 951 – 1 , 038 ) and rng10 ( 1 – 750 ) cells that lack the Rng10 - Rga7 binding interface ( Figure 2A ) . The low division site levels in some Rng10 mutants were not due to a decrease in cellular Rga7 protein concentration ( Figure S2E ) . We therefore hypothe - sized that Rng10 ( 951 – 1 , 038 ) contains an additional protein or membrane - binding motif that modulates the division site target - ing of Rga7 . Rng10 ( 951 – 1 , 038 ) , but not Rng10 ( 751 – 950 ) , bound liposomes in vitro ( Figure 2B ) , but with no apparent lipid speci - ﬁcity beyond a general one for negatively charged PIP species ( Figure 2C ) . A sequence analysis of Rng10 ( 951 – 1 , 038 ) revealed no predicted secondary structure or identiﬁable membrane - binding motif , but it contains 20 % positively charged residues and has an isoelectric point ( pI ) of 10 . 4 , which is consistent with an electrostatic interaction with anionic membranes . Circu - lar dichroism ( CD ) revealed that Rng10 ( 951 – 1 , 038 ) adopts a random coil ( unfolded ) conformation evidenced by its strong downward peak at 200 nm ( Figure 2D ) . Thus , Rng10 ( 951 – 1 , 038 ) is unstructured but capable of binding membranes . In accord Rng10 ( 951 – 1 , 038 ) decorated the entire PM independent of Rga7 ( Figure 2E ) . Cell Reports 26 , 2540 – 2548 , March 5 , 2019 2541 Mechanism of Rga7 F - BAR Membrane Binding That Rng10 contains a membrane - binding motif linked to an Rga7 interaction motif raised the question of whether membrane binding by the Rga7 F - BAR is at all important for Rga7 localiza - tion and function . To determine whether and how the Rga7 F - BAR binds membranes , we generated a structural model of the Rga7 F - BAR dimer ( Figure 3A ) based on the closely related S . cerevisiae Rgd1 F - BAR that has been crystallized ( Moravcevic et al . , 2015 ) . The model predicted the conservation of a PIP 2 binding pocket near the kinks in the F - BAR arms ( blue residues , A B F - BAR Rho - GAP 695 500 320 30 Rga7 Rng10 Coiled - coil 1038 91 71 AH1 - 3 D 0 20 40 60 80 100 GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) GST F r a c t i on o f H i s 6 - R ga7 ( 1 - 320 ) bound ( % ) GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) ( μ M ) K d = 0 . 43 ± 0 . 33 μ M ( n = 4 ) 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 C E K d = 0 . 69 ± 0 . 65 μ M ( n = 6 ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 F r a c t i on o f H i s 6 - R ga7 ( 1 - 320 ) bound ( % ) GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 ) ( μ M ) F 25 kD 37 kD 50 kD 75 kD GST His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) His 6 - mEGFP + _ _ _ + _ _ _ + + _ _ + _ + _ + _ _ _ + _ _ _ + _ + _ + _ + _ GST His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) His 6 - mEGFP Pull - down : GST Input H G 50 kD 37 kD 75 kD GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 ) His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) + _ + + _ + GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 ) His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) Pull - down : GST Input DIC mECitrine mScarlet - I Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) mECitrine - Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) - mScarlet - I Max Mid plane Tom20 - GBP mECitrine - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 ) Rga7 - mCherry mECitrine mCherry Rng10 ( 751 - 950 ) Rga7 DIC mECitrine - Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) Rga7 - mCherry Rng10 ( 1 - 750 ) - mEGFP Rga7 - tdTomato R ng10 Rng10 - mEGFP Rga7 - tdTomato R ga7 R ng10 R ga7 Figure 1 .

These mutations also prevented the Rga7 F - BAR from binding and tubulating giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) ( Figure S3A ) , but they did not prevent binding to the Rng10 C terminus in vitro ( Figures S2F and S2G ) , suggesting that the membrane - and Rng10 - binding sites are on opposite faces of the Rga7 F - BAR domain . When expressed in COS - 7 cells , the Rga7 F - BAR WT , but not membrane - binding mutants , induced tubules that also contained the Rng10 C terminus ( Figures S3B and S3C ) . We next tested whether Rga7 preferentially bound mem - branes of a speciﬁc lipid composition . As predicted by the pres - ence of a PIP 2 binding pocket , the Rga7 F - BAR preferred membranes rich in PI ( 4 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figure 3D ) . The PIP 2 pocket mutant lost this speciﬁcity , binding membranes rich in phosphatidic acid ( PA ) equally well ( Figure 3D ) . To determine whether F - BAR membrane binding is required for Rga7 localization when Rng10 is present , we integrated the F - BAR lipid - binding mutants into rga7 D cells under the endoge - nous rga7 promoter . The PIP 2 pocket mutant still localized to the division site , but with a lower level than WT ( Figure 3E ) , consis - tent with its membrane - binding properties in vitro ( Figure 3B ) . However , combining the PIP 2 binding mutations with core and tip patch mutations eliminated the localization of the Rga7 F - BAR to the division site ( Figure 3E ) . Although the membrane - binding mutants were present at lower levels than WT Rga7 ( Fig - ure 3F ) , sufﬁcient protein was produced for the detection of medial localization if it had occurred and overexpression of the mutants did not restore membrane localization ( Figure S3D ) . We conclude that the Rga7 F - BAR interacts with membranes in a canonical fashion , and its membrane - binding ability is required but insufﬁcient for Rga7 localization . The Rng10 - Rga7 Complex Enhances Rga7 Membrane Binding and Function at Physiological Concentrations Since Rng10 and Rga7 directly interact and both bind mem - branes , we next asked whether the complex had different mem - brane - binding properties than the individual proteins . Rga7 F - BAR binding to liposomes was increased when Rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) was present compared to the F - BAR alone ( Figure 4A ) . When Rng10 lacked either the Rga7 - or membrane - binding motif , this increase was abolished . The increase was particularly pronounced at the lower protein concentrations ( Figure 4A , inset ) that match the global concentrations of Rng10 and Rga7 in cells at 0 . 38 and 1 . 00 m M , respectively ( Figure 4B ; see Method Details ) . The Rga7 level at the division site was only (cid:1) 1 . 3 3 higher than Rng10 , suggesting a 1 : 1 stoichiometry for Rng10 and Rga7 on the PM ( Figure 4C ) . Thus , our results suggest that Rga7 F - BAR and Rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) bind cooperatively to the PM for division - site localization . To evaluate how the Rng10 - Rga7 interaction affects cell divi - sion , we quantiﬁed cell lysis , indicative of septation failure ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) , in the Rng10 and Rga7 mutants described above . The rga7 D and rng10 D mutants had mild lysis at 25 (cid:3) C and severe lysis at 36 (cid:3) C , as did Rng10 mutants lacking Rga7 and / or mem - brane - binding motifs . In contrast , Rng10 ( 751 – 1 , 038 ) had low levels of lysis ( Figure 4D ) . Thus , Rng10 interactions with both Rga7 and the PM are critical for Rga7 function . Although the Rga7 F - BAR alone localizes to the division site in rng10 + cells ( Figure 3E ; Arasada and Pollard , 2015 ) , > 40 % rga7 ( 1 – 320 ) cells lysed at 36 (cid:3) C , comparable to the (cid:1) 50 % lysis of rga7 D cells ( Figure 4D ) , indicating that the Rga7 central region and / or GAP domain contribute to Rga7 function ( Figure 1A ) . This result was unexpected because Rga7 GAP catalytic activity was reported to be dispensable for Rga7 function ( Martı´n - Garcı´a et al . , 2014 ) . We therefore tested whether localizing the Rga7 central and GAP domains to the PM is the critical function of its F - BAR domain by artiﬁcially recruiting them to the division site with Rng10 - GBP . GFP - Rga7 ( 277 – 695 ) alone , lacking themajority of the F - BAR domain , could not localize to the PM , resulting in massive cell lysis ( 58 % ) similar to rga7 D ( Figures 4E and S3E ; Martı´n - Garcı´a et al . , 2014 ) . However , Rng10 - GBP restored GFP - Rga7 ( 277 – 695 ) localization to the division site and signiﬁ - cantly reduced cell lysis ( Figures 4E and S3E ) . Thus , targeting Rga7 central and GAP domains to the PM , but not other possible activities such as membrane tubulation ( Figures S3A and S3B ) or curvature sensing , is the critical function of Rga7 F - BAR . Our data indicate that the interaction between the Rga7 F - BAR and Rng10 ensures the division site localization of Rga7 by elevating its membrane - binding avidity , and this supports efﬁcient septation during cytokinesis . Analogous examples of such cooperativity between intramolecular dual membrane - binding domains exist in a few F - BAR and N - BAR proteins ( Carman and Dominguez , 2018 ) . The Fes F - BAR domain and adjacent FX domain cooperate to increase mem - brane avidity ( Itoh et al . , 2009 ) . APPL1 contains an N - BAR domain and an immediately adjacent pleckstrin homology domain , which also binds phospholipids ( Lemmon , 2004 ) . The sorting nexin Snx9 contains a phox homology domain that binds phosphatidylinositols preceding the N - BAR domain ( Pylypenko et al . , 2007 ) . The Rga7 F - BAR appears to use a similar strategy of a second membrane - binding domain , but in this case , within its partner , Rng10 . In general , individual F - BARs are relatively weak membrane - binding domains ; it is only by interacting with another membrane - binding domain or by extensive oligo - merization as seen in many other F - BARs ( McDonald and Figure 3 .

Furthermore , we have mechanistically illustrated a case in which the ability of an F - BAR domain to bind membranes is necessary but not sufﬁcient for cellular localization . Instead , the domain relies on linkage to an adaptor protein that has addi - tional membrane - binding potential to cooperatively achieve stable and speciﬁc membrane associations ( Figure 4F ) .

N - terminal truncations and tagging of rng10 were constructed with pFA6a - kanMX6 - Prng10 - mECitrine ( JQW908 ) as the PCR template , resulting in strains under the control of the native promoter of rng10 ( (cid:4) 510 to + 6 bp ) . N - terminal tagging of Rga7 F - BAR mutants was constructed using pFA6a - kanMX6 - P3nmt1 - mECitrine ( JQW331 ) . All strains from gene targeting were conﬁrmed by PCR and visual screening if possible . To minimize cell lysis , some spores from crosses were germinated on medium with 1 . 2 M sorbitol . Rga7 F - BAR lipid - binding mutants were synthesized in a pET - 15b protein expression plasmid by GenScript ( Piscataway , NJ ) . The resulting plasmids ( JQW923 - JQW925 ) were used as templates for PCR and further cloning . The mutants are : PIP 2 mutant , R144D / K148E ; PIP 2 + Core mutant , K60E / K67E / K78E / K82E / R144D / K148E ; PIP 2 + Core + Tips mutant , K60E / K67E / K78E / K82E / R144D / K148E / K167E / R181D / K194E . To integrate these mutations into the rga7 locus , the whole rga7 ORF was deleted using pFA6a - ura4 + ( JQW328 ) to obtain the rga7 D : : ura4 + strain . Then rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) sequences with the desired mutations were ampliﬁed from plas - mids JQW923 - JQW925 using primers containing sequences of the 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs of rga7 . The PCR products were transformed into the rga7 D : : ura4 + cells . Positive transformants were selected by resistance to 5 - ﬂuoroorotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) and conﬁrmed by sequencing . To construct protein expression plasmids , rng10 and rga7 fragments were ampliﬁed from genomic DNA . Rng10 fragments were cloned into pQE - 80L ( His tag ) at Sac I and PstI sites , or pGEX - 4T - 1 ( GST tag ) at EcoRI and Not I sites . Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) was cloned into pQE - 80L at BamHI and SalI sites . Synthesized Rga7 F - BAR lipid - binding mutant DNAs were ampliﬁed and re - cloned into pEGFP - C1 at EcoRI and BamHI sites and pET15b - GFP at Nde I and BamHI sites . Microscopy Confocal microscopy was performed as previously described ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) . For analyses of cell lysis , cells were ﬁrst grown exponentially in YE5S liquid medium at 25 (cid:3) C for (cid:1) 40 h and then imaged or shifted to 36 (cid:3) C for 4 h before imaging . Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 s and imaged on the glass slide with a pad of YE5S with 20 % gelatin and 50 nM n - propyl - gallate ( n - PG ) at room temperature . For ﬂuorescence microscopy , cells were grown exponentially in YE5S liquid medium at 25 (cid:3) C for 2 days , or in EMM5S liquid medium at 25 (cid:3) C for 24 h to induce overexpression of Rga7 F - BAR mutants . Cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then washed twice with EMM5S to reduce autoﬂuorescence . n - PG from a 10 3 stock made in EMM5S were added to EMM5S in the second wash to a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nM , to reduce phototoxicity and photobleaching ( Giloh and Sedat , 1982 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ) . Live cells were imaged on a glass slide with a pad of EMM5S with 20 % gelatin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Loius , MO ) and 50 nM n - PG at 23 - 24 (cid:3) C . Fission yeast cells were imaged on two microscopy systems with 100x / 1 . 4 numerical aperture ( NA ) Plan - Apo objective lenses ( Nikon , Melville , NY ) . Differential interference contrast ( DIC ) images for quantiﬁcation of cell lysis were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon DS - QI1 cooled digital camera . Fluorescence images were taken using a spinning - disk confocal system ( UltraVIEW Vox CSUX1 system ; PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) with 440 - , 488 - , 515 - , and 561 - nm solid - state lasers and back thinned electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( EMCCD ) cameras ( C9100 - 13 or C9100 - 23B ; Hamamatsu Photonics , Bridgewater , NJ ) on a Nikon Ti - E microscope . COS - 7 cells and giant unilamellar vesicles were imaged on a Personal Deltavision system ( GE ) equipped with 63X 1 . 4NA objective , Coolsnap2 CCD camera , and 488 - , 561 - , and 647 - nm lasers . Image Analysis Images were processed and analyzed using Volocity ( PerkinElmer ) and ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . Fluorescence images in ﬁgures are maximum - intensity projections with z sections spaced at 0 . 5 m m except where noted . Some im - ages contain lysed cells , which have bright autoﬂuorescence . Protein Puriﬁcation and in vitro Binding Assay Puriﬁcations of His 6 - or GST - tagged proteins from E . coli were carried out as previously described ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) . His 6 - tagged proteins were puriﬁed with Talon metal afﬁnity resin ( 635501 ; Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) in extraction buffer ( 50 mM sodium phos - phate , pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 10 mM b - mercaptoethanol , 1 mM PMSF , and 10 mM imidazole ) with EDTA - free protease inhibitor tablet ( Roche ) and eluted with elution buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 10 mM b - mercaptoethanol , 1 mM PMSF , and 200 mM imidazole ) . GST - tagged proteins were puriﬁed with Glutathione - Sepharose beads ( 17 - 5132 - 01 ; GE Healthcare ) in phos - phate extraction buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 6 . 0 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 mM DTT ) with EDTA - free protease inhibitor tablet and eluted with glutathione ( 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 6 . 1 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM DTT , 100 m M gluta - thione ) . The puriﬁed proteins were then dialyzed into the ﬁnal reaction buffer . For in vitro binding assay between GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) and His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) , puriﬁed proteins were dialyzed into the binding buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 0 ) . GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) or GST control ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) was incubated with glutathione - Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 (cid:3) C and washed 4 times with the binding buffer to remove unbound proteins . His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) or His 6 - mEGFP control ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) was then incubated with the beads for 2 h at 4 (cid:3) C . After 5 washes e2 Cell Reports 26 , 2540 – 2548 . e1 – e4 , March 5 , 2019 with the binding buffer , the beads were boiled with sample buffer for 5 min . Then the samples were run on SDS - PAGE gel and detected with Coomassie Blue staining . For in vitro binding assays between GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 / 1038 ) and His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) mutants , GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 / 1038 ) was ﬁrst puriﬁed and dialyzed into the binding buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 mM DTT ) and then incubated with glutathione - Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 (cid:3) C . The beads were washed once , resuspended , and aliquoted in equal volume . His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) wild - type control and mutants were prepared in small scale by resuspending cells in the binding buffer and sonicating to break the cells . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 (cid:3) C . Rga7 proteins in the super - natant were normalized to similar protein levels and added to the aliquoted GST - Rng10 bound beads . After 1 h incubation at 4 (cid:3) C , beads were washed 3 times with the binding buffer , and boiled with sample buffer . Then the samples were run on SDS - PAGE gel and detected with western blotting . For measuring the K d between Rng10 ( 751 - 950 / 1038 ) and Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) , we followed the described methods and guidelines ( Lee et al . , 1999 ; Pollard , 2010 ) . The procedure was similar to the in vitr o binding assays described in the previous paragraph except different concentrations of beads and puriﬁed GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 / 1038 ) were incubated with the same concentration of His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) from large - scale puriﬁcation . Total amount of bead bound GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 / 1038 ) was estimated by subtracting the remaining proteins in the supernatant ( including proteins released during washing ) from the total input . We formed a GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 / 1038 ) concentration gradient by adding different volumes of GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 / 1038 ) bound beads ( 0 , 20 , 50 , 80 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , 300 , 350 , and 400 m l ) to each tube . The same volumes of GST bound beads were used as the control . Binding buffer and a ﬁnal concentration of 1 m M His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) were added to a ﬁnal volume of 500 m l for each tube . After incubation for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C , the beads were spun down at 15 , 000 rpm for 5 min , supernatant samples removed from the reactions were boiled with sample buffer , run on an SDS - PAGE gel , and detected with Coomassie Blue staining . Liposome Co - pelleting Assays Liposomes were prepared as previously described ( McDonald et al . , 2015 ) . Lipid chloroform stocks ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Alabaster , AL ) were mixed at the desired ratios , vacuum dried into a thin ﬁlm in a glass tube , and resuspended at 1 mg / ml in 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl buffer with vortexing . The resulting liposome mix was freeze - thawed 10x and passed through an 800 nm liposome extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Alabaster , AL ) . 100 m l liposomes were mixed with 100 m l puriﬁed Rga7 or Rng10 protein at the indicated concentrations ( or 20 m g when not indicated ) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature . Bound liposomes were centrifuged at 150 , 000 g for 15 min and supernatant ( unbound ) and pellet ( bound ) fractions were separated and runon an SDS - PAGE for Coomassie blue detection . Giant unilamellar vesicles were formed as previously described ( McDonald and Gould , 2016a ) . Chloroform lipid stocks of the desired composition were evaporated on ITO - coated glass coverslides . Coverslides were assembled into a 1 mm thick chamber ﬁlled with a 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 500 mM sucrose solution . A 10 Hz , 2 . 5 V sine current was passed across the chamber for 2 h to electroform the GUVs . Circular Dichroism and Structural Modeling The CD spectrum was collected using Jasco J815 spectropolarimeter ( Easton , MD , USA ) under UV spectroscopy in 1 - cm quartz cuvettes at 25 (cid:3) C . CD scans ranged from 180 to 300 nm at a scan rate of 200 nm / min with 1 s interval . Reactions were performed in 25 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 with a protein concentration of at least 10 m M . Data analyses were carried out using K2D3 algorithm to predict secondary structures ( Louis - Jeune et al . , 2012 ) . The Rga7 F - BAR structure was modeled using the Phyre2 server ( Kelley et al . , 2015b ) based on the S . cerevisiae Rgd1 crystal structure ( Moravcevic et al . , 2015 ) . Analytical Ultracentrifugation Puriﬁed His 6 - Rga7 F - BAR was diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 5 mg / ml before ultracentrifugation . Puriﬁed GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 1038 ) was added at equimolar concentration . A sedimentation experiment was run at 42 , 000 rpm at 4 (cid:3) C on an Optima XLI ultracentrifuge ( Beckman - Coulter ) with a four - hole An60Ti rotor containing 1 . 2 cm path - length sapphire windows . 280 nm scan data were analyzed with SedFit ( version 14 . 81 ) using 250 scans collected (cid:1) 2 min apart ( Schuck , 2000 ) . Size distributions were determined for a conﬁ - dence level of p = 0 . 95 and resolution of n = 200 . Cell Culture COS - 7 cells were transfected with a Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocols . Membranes were labeled with the CellMask Deep Red reagent ( Thermo Fisher ) . Cells were harvested with trypsin and centrifugation , and lysed in RIPA buffer ( 25 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS ) before western blotting . Western Blotting Rga7 immunoblotting was carried out as previously described ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) . Lyophilized cells ( (cid:1) 5 mg ) were ground into a homo - geneous powder and mixed with IP buffer ( 1 % NP - 40 buffer [ 50 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ] , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % NP - 40 , 50 mM NaF , 20 mM glycerophosphate , and 0 . 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 ] , 1 mM PMSF , and protease inhibitor [ Roche ] ) . Sample buffer was added to the lysate and boiled . Protein samples were separated on an SDS - PAGE gel and Cell Reports 26 , 2540 – 2548 . e1 – e4 , March 5 , 2019 e3 detected with ( 1 ) a monoclonal anti - GFP antibody ( 1 : 2000 dilution ; 11814460001 ; Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) or a TAT1 antibody for tubulin ( 1 : 20 , 000 dilution ; ( Woods et al . , 1989 ) ; and ( 2 ) a secondary antibody anti - mouse immunoglobulin G ( 1 : 5000 dilution ; A4416 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . ECL ( SuperSignal Maximum Sensitivity Substrate , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) was used to develop the protein bands on ﬁlm ( BioMax MR ; Kodak , Rochester , NY ) . For in vitro binding assays between GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 / 1038 ) and His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) wild - type control and three mutants , inputs and bound proteins were detected with monoclonal anti - His ( 1 : 20 , 000 dilution ; 631212 , Clontech ) or anti - GST ( 1 : 20 , 000 dilution ; NB600 - 446 , Novus Biologicals ) antibodies . Secondary anti - mouse ﬂuorescent antibody ( 92568070 , LI - COR ) was used at 1 : 10 , 000 dilution . Protein bands were detected using LI - COR ( Odyssey CLx ) at 700 nm channel . COS - 7 cell lysates were separated on an SDS - PAGE gel and detected with a monoclonal anti - GFP primary antibody ( 1 : 1000 ; Roche ) and anti - mouse ﬂuorescent secondary antibody ( LI - COR ) before detection using a LI - COR Odyssey . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Protein molecular numbers were calculated from quantifying ﬂuorescence intensity ( Deng et al . , 2014 ; Liu et al . , 2016 ) . Only the cen - tral (cid:1) 75 % of cells in the imaging ﬁeld were analyzed to minimize the effects of uneven illumination . We summed intensity from 13 z sections at 0 . 5 m m spacing . For global protein level quantiﬁcation , the polygon region of interest ( ROI ) tool in ImageJ was applied to trace cell boundaries . Then WT cells with no ﬂuorescent tag were used to deduct the background . Some of the intensities were con - verted to concentrations and molecule numbers using a protein standard curve generated from proteins with known molecule numbers ( Liu et al . , 2016 ; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . The global concentration was calculated using mean molecules and a cytoplasm volume of 27 m m 3 that occupies (cid:1) 30 % of a total cell volume ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) To quantify protein levels on the PM at the cell side , mean intensity of the PM between the division site and the cell tips was measured at the middle z section . Background was subtracted using cytoplasm mean intensity ( avoiding nucleus region ) . For measuring the K d between two proteins , intensity for each Coomassie - stained protein band was measured and background subtracted . We deﬁned the intensity of the sample without beads as 100 % and normalized others accordingly , which corresponded to unbound proteins . The percentages of bound His 6 - Rga7 ( 1 - 320 ) were calculated as a function of the GST - Rng10 ( 751 - 950 / 1038 ) concentrations . Analyzed data were plotted and ﬁtted in KaleidaGraph ( Synergy Software ) using the equation y = B max ( x / [ x + K d ] ) , where B max is the maximal speciﬁc binding . Data in ﬁgures are mean ± SEM except where noted . The P value s in statistical analysis were calculated using a one - way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc analysis . e4 Cell Reports 26 , 2540 – 2548 . e1 – e4 , March 5 , 2019 Cell Reports , Volume 26 Supplemental Information The F - BAR Domain of Rga7 Relies on a Cooperative Mechanism of Membrane Binding with a Partner Protein during Fission Yeast Cytokinesis Yajun Liu , Nathan A .
