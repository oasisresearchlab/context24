V . 2007 Abstract Metastasis is a complicated process that depends largely on the interaction of primary tumors and the local host environment . In this study , we have estab - lished a new mouse model to mimic the process of tumor metastasis in breast cancer patients . TM40D - MB mouse mammary tumor cells were transplanted to the mammary glands of syngeneic mice . Mammary tumors developed in the glands in situ and were metastatic to bone with over 53 % efﬁciency . We compared the gene expression proﬁle of high ( TM40D - MB ) vs . low metastatic ( TM40D ) tumor cells using Affymetrix microarray chips . Microarray analysis revealed a list of genes that were consistently up - / down - regulated in TM40D - MB tumor cells . One of the genes , COX2 was selected for functional study . Injection of TM40D - COX2 cells to mouse femur caused a signiﬁcant increase in bone destruction compared to TM40D - C control , as measured by the micro - computed tomography ( l CT ) scanning for the trabecular bone volume . In vitro assays showed that COX2 signiﬁcantly increased the rate of osteoclast formation , and this effect was reversible by the speciﬁc COX2 inhibitor NS - 398 . These data indicate that COX2 is one gene important for breast cancer bone metastasis . The availability of this mouse model and the comparative study of gene expression signatures between TM40D and other bone metastasis models will likely generate important information about common pathways for breast cancer bone metastasis . Further functional studies of metastasis signature genes should help to develop means to curb the metastasis process .

A common view is that tumor metastasis is achieved after tumor cells acquire multiple alterations that render them more competent to establish metastatic lesions in distant organs [ 3 , 4 ] . However , recent studies argue that some portions of primary tumor cells Zhigang Li and Christian Schem contributed equally to this study . Z . Li (cid:1) C . Schem (cid:1) Y . H . Shi (cid:1) D .

Regardless of the timing of the acquisition of met - astatic properties , the process ultimately depends on the interaction of primary tumors and the host environment such as bone . In addition , those breast cancer cells that successfully metastasize to bone host must possess unique features that are likely represented by their gene expression patterns that serve as the molecular signatures of bone metastasis . The study of breast cancer bone metastasis requires the development of appropriate animal models . The ideal model would be the one in which breast cancer develops spontaneously in the mammary gland and then the tumors metastasize to the bone . There are two approaches for generating spontaneous tumors in mammary gland . One involves targeting an oncogene to mouse mammary gland using a mammary cell speciﬁc promoter . Using this transgenic approach , nearly one hundred genetically engi - neered mouse models have been developed for breast cancer research in the past two decades [ 8 ] . The other approach takes advantage of a technique of mammary transplantation developed by mammary gland biologists [ 9 ] . It involves transplanting a small number of mammary epithelial cells into the mammary fat pad , and allowing these epithelial cells to develop into hyperplastic mammary outgrowths within the gland . The mammary outgrowths can be serially transplanted to the mammary gland and develop into mammary tumors within the gland [ 10 ] . Using this approach , one can examine mammary tumor metastasis in a syngeneic mouse background , in which the mouse immune system is intact . We have established a new mouse model of bone metastasis to mimic the process of tumor metastasis in breast cancer patients . We have compared the gene expression proﬁle of highly metastatic tumor cells with that of low metastatic cells using Affymetrix microarray chips , validated the expression patterns of some candidate genes , and analyzed the effect of Cox2 gene in breast cancer progression and in osteolytic bone remodeling . Further functional studies of microarray - identiﬁed genes should provide important insights on the molecular mechanism of bone metastasis , and may help us to develop means to prevent breast cancer metastasis . Materials and methods Cells and cell culture TM40D mammary cells were derived from the FSK4 mammary epithelial cell line established in vitro from normal mouse mammary gland [ 11 ] . The TM40D out - growth line in vivo produces mammary tumors with a high potential for lung metastasis [ 12 ] . TM40D mammary tumor cells were grown in the medium of DMEM / F12 with 2 % FBS , epidermal growth factor , and insulin as described previously [ 13 ] . TM40D cells were genetically engineered with a marker GFP [ 13 ] . Intracardiac injections of tumor cells in BALB / c mice The intracardiac injection of tumor cells is carried out with a modiﬁed procedure of Li et al . [ 14 ] . Female 12 - week - old BALB / c mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley , Inc . and were housed in a pathogen - free envi - ronment . TM40D cells were trypsinized , and washed twice with PBS . The washed cells were resuspended in cold PBS at a density of 2 . 5 · 10 6 cells / ml on ice . Before injection , the animals were anesthetized with 2 . 5 % avertin ( 10 l l / g body weight i . p . ) . About 5 · 10 5 cells were injected into the left cardiac ventricles of animals with a 27 - gauge needle . After injection , the mice were placed on a heating pad for recovering from anesthesia . Body weights of ani - mals were measured and the development of bone metastases was monitored three weeks after injection two times a week for any sign of paraplegia . Mice with impairment of movement were monitored daily . At the time when mice had any sign of paraplegia or at the end point of experiment , animals were examined by X - ray radiography using a Faxitron radiographic inspection unit ( model 43855A ) . Exposed ﬁlms were developed using an automatic ﬁlm processor ( Kodak RP X - OMAT ) . Radio - graphs of bone were evaluated for the presence of tumor foci . All animal care was in accord with the guidelines of Baylor College of Medicine . Isolation of tumor cells from bone The procedure was based on a modiﬁed method as described [ 15 ] . To isolate TM40D - MB cells from bone tissues , the mice with bone lesions detected by X - ray examination were sacriﬁced . The affected forelimbs or hindlimbs were excised from the body at the joints , the soft tissues were removed with a scalpel , and the bone tissue was washed three times with PBS in a screw - capped tube and transfer to cell culture dishes . The tissues were incu - bated at 37 (cid:2) C for 1 h with collagenase - 3 ( 200 U / ml ) and were spanned at 1 , 000 rpm for 5 min . The pellets were washed and resuspended in the medium of DMEM / F12 with 2 % FBS and were cultured in 60 mm culture dishes . Tumor cells were selected with 100 l g / ml of zeocine . For immunostaining , cells were grown on chamber slides and ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution for 1 hr . The slides were blocked with 10 % normal rabbit serum for 1 h before 390 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 389 – 400 123 they were treated with the anti - keratin 8 antibody ( Troma 1 , Iowa hybridoma bank , DHSB ) at a dilution of 1 : 100 . The secondary antibody ( rabbit - anti - rat IgG ; Santa Cruz Bio - technology ) was used at a dilution of 1 : 1000 at room temperature for 1 h . Slides were then rinsed and incubated with an avidin – biotin – peroxidase complex ( ABC kit ; Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) , followed by 3 , 3 0 - diaminobenzidine color development ( DAB kit ; Zymed Laboratories , Inc . , CA ) . To further prove the origin of TM40D - MB , we used PCR analysis for GFP marker , which was integrated to TM40D cells for monitoring purpose as described previously [ 13 ] . DNA was extracted from TM40D , TM40D - MB , and C2N mouse prostate tumor cells ( a negative control ) . The GFP primers were : 5 0 primer ; GATGACGGGAACTACAAGA , 3 0 primer ; GGACAGGGCCATCGCCAAT . As a control , PCR anal - ysis was carried out with mouse L19 ribosomal gene primers . Primers for L19 were as follows : 5 0 primer , 5 - CT GAAGGTCAAAGGGAATGTG - 3 ; 3 0 primer , 5 - GGACA - GAGTCTTGATGATCTC - 3 . The cycling condition for PCR is : denaturation at 94 (cid:2) C , 45 s , annealing at 56 (cid:2) C , 45 s , and extension at 72 (cid:2) C , 45 s , for a total of 35 cycles . The size of GFP DNA band was 275 base pairs and L19 band was 200 bp . The cells were named as TM40D - MB cells ( MB , metastatic to bone ) . TM40D - MB cells at pas - sage of 5 – 6 were used for subsequent experiment . Implantation of tumor cells to BALB / c mice The implantation procedure was described previously [ 13 ] . Twelve - week old BALB / c mice were used in the implan - tation . Parental TM40D and TM40D - MB cells were grown to 70 – 85 % of conﬂuence before being harvested for cell counting . An equal number of TM40D and TM40D - MB cells ( 7 · 10 5 ) were inoculated into # 4 mammary glands bilaterally . Fifteen mice were used for TM40D - MB ( 30 sites ) and thirteen for TM40D controls ( 26 sites ) . In a separate experiment , same amount of TM40D - Cox2 and TM40D - C cells were inoculated to # 4 mammary fat pads bilaterally . 20 mice were used for TM40D - Cox2 cells ( 40 sites ) and 10 mice were used for TM40D - C cells ( 20 sites ) . Tumor initiation was monitored every two days by palpa - tion . Tumor volume was calculated using the formula : length · width 2 / 2 . Tumor growth rate was monitored every 2 days by caliper measurement and tumor volume calcu - lated as ( mm 3 ) / day . Body weights of animals were measured and the development of bone metastases was monitored by X - ray radiography from three weeks after injection . When one of the tumors grew to the size of 2 . 0 cm in diameter ( tumor weight less than 10 % of body weight ) , the mice were sacriﬁced , following AAALAC guideline and the rules set by institutional IACUC . X - ray radiography was performed before the mice were sacri - ﬁced , and hindlimbs were excised for histology and immunohistochemistry . Histological examinations and immunohistochemistry Histology and immunohistochemistry of bone tissue were carried out based on a modiﬁed method as described before [ 14 ] . The hind limbs were excised , and then were decal - ciﬁed and ﬁxed in Cal - Ex II solution ( Fisher Scientiﬁc ) for 24 h . All tissues were embedded in parafﬁn , and sectioned at 5 l m . Sections were either stained by H & E or by anti - body against tumor marker keratin 8 as described above . Micrographs were taken with a Leica microscope equipped with a digital camera . Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using the t test ( two - sided analysis ) and Chi - square analysis . All data shown were the mean ± SEM . A value of P \ 0 . 05 was considered as signiﬁcant . RNA extraction and hybridization Total RNA was extracted from TM40D and TM40D - MB cells , using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen Sciences , Inc . , MD ) . The integrity of isolated RNA was conﬁrmed in each case using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Palo Alto , CA ) . Gene Chips ( MG - U74v2 ) were purchased from Affymetrix ; Santa Clara , CA . Sample preparation and microarray processing were done according to the manufacturer’s recommendation . Two experimental replicates of the TM40D cells and 3 experimental replicates of the TM40D - MB cells were hybridised to the MG - U74v2 arrays . Data ﬁltering and analysis The . CEL ﬁles generated by the Affymetrix Microarray Suite ( MAS ) version 5 . 0 were converted into . DCP ﬁles using dCHIP ( www . dCHIP . org ) , as described previously by Li and Wong [ 16 ] . The . DCP ﬁles were normalised using the method of in variant Set Normalization , and gene expression data generated using the dCHIP system of model - based analysis ( Perfect Match Model only ) . A comparison was performed using the dCHIP software itself , wherein the two Chips ran with RNA of the TM40D Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 389 – 400 391 123 Cells were designated as ‘‘baseline / B’’ , and the three Chips ran with RNA of the TM40D - MB cells designated as ‘‘experiment / E’’ . Each chip used was hybridized to the same RNA extract , representing an experimental replicate . Genes expressed twofold or higher in the cells extracted from the bone tumors versus the original cell sample were then identiﬁed by deﬁning the appropriate ﬁltering criteria in the dCHIP software ( mean E / mean B [ 2 ; mean E – mean B = 100 , P £ 0 . 05 ( P - value for testing E = B ) , p call of B = 100 % and p call of E = 100 % , P £ 0 . 001 ) . To evaluate how the samples grouped together accord - ing to the similarity of their gene expression proﬁle , we used hierarchical clustering with the centroid linkage method . For hierarchical cluster analysis , data were log - transformed , median - centered , and visualized using the CLUSTER and TREEVIEW programs . To verify the data gained from the dChip analysis , the data sets were also processed with the GeneSpring software ( Silicon Genetics , Redwood City , CA ) . Gene expression proﬁles were com - pared in a Venn diagram and genes represented in the dChip evaluation were also present in the Gene - Spring analysis . Genes not present in both lists were excluded from further studies . About 100 genes were identiﬁed ( data not shown ) . Among them , 20 genes that were consistently shown 4 fold or more changes were chosen for statistical analysis . Validating the candidate genes from array analysis by Northern blot analysis Primers for COX2 , Fgf7 , and Ptx 3 cDNAs were obtained from the published sequences in the Pub med . All of the primers were designed to span at least one intron . The primer sequences are the following . COX2 primers are : 5 0 primer ; GCTGTACAAGCAGTGGCAAA , 3 0 primer ; CCCCAAAGATAGCATCTGGA . Fgf7 primers are : 5 0 primer ; TGAGGATTGCAACTTCAAAGAA , 3 0 primer ; CCGGAATTCTTAGCTTATTGCCATAGG . Ptx 3 primers are : 5 0 primer ; GTGGGTGGAAAGGAGAACAA ; 3 0 pri - mer ; CGGAATTCTTAAGAAACATACTGGGCTCC . For Northern blot analysis , cDNA fragments were generated by RT - PCR and puriﬁed for radiolabeling using a random - prime labeling kit from Amersham , Inc . RNAs were har - vested from TM40D and TM40D - MB cells and 20 l g of RNAs were loaded on the gel and transferred to nylon membrane using the method as described before [ 17 ] . The hybridization and washing conditions are following the protocol as described previously [ 17 ] . 36B4 ribosomal gene was used as a loading control for normalization . Northern blot bands were scanned through a densitometer , and the band density was quantitated using NIH image software . Functional analysis of COX2 gene in TM40D cells A COX2 full - length cDNA clone was purchased from ATCC . The cDNA was inserted into a mammalian expression vector in which COX2 was directed by an elongation factor promoter ( pEF - COX2 ) . The Cox2 expression vector and a pEF empty vector were transfected into TM40D cells individually , and a pool of stable clones were harvested after 3 weeks of selection under G418 at 0 . 6 l g / ml , and were named as TM40D - C and TM40D - COX2 . Cox2 overexpression in TM40D - COX2 cells was veriﬁed and compared with TM40D - C cells by RT - PCR analysis . Cox2 was overexpressed 6 . 2 fold in TM40D - Cox2 compared to TM40D - C cells . Both TM40D - C and TM40D - COX2 were used in the following osteoclast for - mation assay . Bone marrow cells were co - cultured with breast tumor cells for the analysis of osteoclast differenti - ation . The procedure was based on a method described in Michgami et al . [ 18 ] . TRAP ( + ) cells containing 2 or more nuclei were deﬁned as osteoclasts . The number of osteo - clasts was manually counted and the average number of osteoclasts in each well and the SEM were calculated based on counts from ﬁve independent , randomly selected ﬁelds . Percentage of osteoclasts was calculated from the number of whole population of bone marrow cells per · 200 microscope ﬁeld , mainly including osteoblasts and osteo - clasts . The experiments were repeated three times with similar results . l CT analysis of osteoclastic lesions in mice implanted with TM40D - COX2 and TM40D - C tumors Subconﬂuent TM40D - C and TM40D - COX2 cells were collected following trypsin treatment and resuspended in PBS at 1 · 10 4 / l l . Mice were anesthetized ﬁrst . A hole was made in the distal epiphysis of the right femur with a 27 - gauge needle , and tumor cells were inoculated by in - traosseal injection based on the procedure by Uehara et al . [ 19 ] . Brieﬂy , after penetrating the cortical bone , the cells - containing needle was further inserted into the shaft of the femur , and 10 l l of cell suspension ( 1 · 10 5 cells ) was injected into the cortex with the use of a calibrated , push button - controlled dispensing device ( Hamilton Syringe Co . , Reno , NV ) . To prevent leakage of cell suspensions , a tight cotton swab was held against the injection site for 1 min . The success rate was 95 % for femur injection in mice . Body weights of animals were measured and the development of bone metastases was monitored by X - ray radiography from three weeks after injection . Based on the X - ray radiography , all animals , six injected with TM40D - COX2 and nine with TM40D - C , were sacriﬁced 5 weeks 392 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 389 – 400 123 after tumor inoculation and the femur tissues were har - vested for l CT analysis of bone remodeling , using the micro - computed tomography system ( l CT40 , Scanco Medical , Switzerland ) . Each femur sample was scanned for 300 slices , starting from the distal growth plate up towards the proximal end of the bone , and each slice was 12 microns . The CT scanned distance is 3 . 6 mm ( 300 sli - ces · 12 microns / slice ) . The trabecular bone volume ( mm 3 ) in the scanned area was calculated automatically for each sample by the computer with the automated image software . Data from all samples were analyzed by two - tailed t - Test program for statistical analysis . ELISA assay of PGE2 production in conditioned medium of tumor cells Conditioned media were harvested from TM40D - C , TM40D - Cox2 , and TM40D - MB cells that were cultured under subconﬂuent condition . For each kind of cells , medium solutions collected from ﬁve different plates were quickly frozen in dry ice and used in the ELISA assay . ELISA was performed with Prostaglandin E2 express EIA kit from Cayman Chemical , Inc . ( Cat # 500141 ) , according to the manufacturer’s instruction . COX2 speciﬁc inhibitor NS - 398 was also purchased from Cayman Chemical , Inc . ( Cat # 70590 ) , and used at the suggested concentrations . ELISA assays were repeated three times and data were analyzed with a statistical t - Test program . Results In this study , we have established a new mouse model of bone metastasis in the syngeneic BALB / c background ( Fig . 1 ) . We chose the TM40D cell line . TM40D cells were initially isolated from the FSK4 mammary epithelial cell line , which formed hyperplastic mammary outgrowths when implanted into mammary glands of BALB / c mice [ 11 , 13 ] . The serially transformed outgrowths produced mammary tumors after transplantation and with lung metastasis [ 12 ] . The TM40D cell line was established from a TM40 primary tumor . It is well known that the metastasis process from primary epithelial tumor is an inefﬁcient process [ 20 ] . Tumor cells need to invade through the stroma and enter the circulation system before reaching the bone for colonization . A majority of tumor cells are killed during this process , likely by the immune defense , which is present in syngeneic mouse . To overcome this inefﬁcient process , we used a technique developed by Arguello et al . to inoculate tumor cells into the blood circulation by left ventricle injection [ 21 ] . This approach has been demon - strated to be effective for allowing tumor cells to colonize in bone . To examine whether TM40D tumors can migrate to the bone , we inoculated 5 · 10 5 TM40D cells to syn - geneic BALB / c mice through left cardiac ventricle injection ( Fig . 1 ) . Mice that were inoculated with tumor cells developed bone lesions that were osteolytic in nature ( Fig . 2a ) . We hypothesized that these mammary tumors that were in the bone either represented a subset of tumor cells that had the bone metastasis signatures or had acquired unique expression patterns through their interac - tion with other components in the bone tissue . We isolated the breast tumor cells from those mice that had bone lesions as conﬁrmed by X - ray radiography , and established them in cell culture . The isolated tumor cells had a spindle - like epithelial cell morphology ( Fig . 2b ) , were positive for cytokeratin 8 antibody , an epithelial marker ( Fig . 2c ) , and were conﬁrmed to be TM40D cells by a polymerase chain reaction for a unique GFP marker ( Fig . 2d ) . They were also highly invasive as analyzed by Boyden chamber invasion assay , compared to TM - 40D ( data not shown ) . This tumor subline was termed TM40D - MB ( MB , metastatic to bone ) . To determine whether TM40D - MB cells possess unique features that would allow them to metastasize to bone spontaneously , we implanted TM40D - MB cells to the bilateral # 4 mammary glands of BALB / c mice ( Fig . 1 ) . As a control , we implanted the parental TM40D cells to the # 4 mammary glands of age matched female mice . Both groups of mice developed mammary tumors ( 100 % ) ( Fig . 3a ) . Histology and immunohistochemistry using keratin 8 antibody conﬁrmed the presence of mammary tumors ( data not shown ) . All of the mice in both groups were sacriﬁced when the primary tumors grew to a predetermined size ( see method ) . At the end point , all mice were sacriﬁced after they were exposed to X - ray radiography . Bone metastasis positive mice were identiﬁed initially by X - ray radiography ( Fig . 2e ) . To conﬁrm the data from X - radiography , bone samples from putative lesion areas were decalciﬁed and embedded . Sections were stained by hematoxylin & eosin for histology and immunohistochemistry . Fig . 2f shows tumor growth and invasion of TM40D - MB cells to the bone marrow . In addition , anti - keratin 8 antibody was used to conﬁrm the presence of tumor cells in the bone tissue ( Fig . 2g ) . The growth rate of primary tumors in mammary glands was monitored biweekly by measuring the size of tumors with a caliper . No signiﬁcant difference in the growth rate of mammary tumors was observed between these two groups , and the observation time ( time period from the appearance of tumor to endpoint ) for both groups was similar ( 41 days , Fig . 3a ) . However , there was a signiﬁcant difference in the frequency of bone metastases ( Fig . 3b ) . From both X - ray and histological analyses , we concluded that 53 . 3 % of mice that had been implanted with TM40D - MB cells developed bone metastasis ( Fig . 3b ) . However , in Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 389 – 400 393 123 the control group , only 7 . 7 % of mice implanted with parental TM40D cells developed bone lesions ( Chi square , P \ 0 . 001 ) . In addition , upon dissection of the mice , the majority of mice in both groups had developed metastases surrounding the intestines . These tumors appear to have invaded from mammary fat pads into the abdomen as reported in a previous study [ 22 ] . A minority had visible tumors on the surface of lung , with same frequency found in a previous report [ 22 ] . No obvious differences were observed for the incidence of intestine tumors by gross observation between TM40D and TM40D - MB tumors , suggesting TM40D - MB tumor cells retained the general invasive properties of TM40D cells but gained new fea - tures for the preferential metastasis to the bone . Fig . 1 A schematic illustration of the procedure of experimental bone metastasis model . TM40D tumor cells were initially inoculated to the BALB / c mouse through left cardiac injection . Three to ﬁve weeks after the inoculation of TM40D cells , bone lesions were detected by X - ray radiography . Tumor cells that possess the high potential of bone metastasis ( TM40D - MB ) were isolated from the bone , and were later inoculated to the mammary gland for the observation of mammary tumor growth and subsequent bone metastasis . TM40D and highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells were analyzed for gene expression proﬁles by microarray analysis using the Affymetrix gene chips Fig . 2 Analysis of the processes of mammary tumor metastasis to bone .

Pictures for bone sections were taken at a magniﬁcation of 40 · 394 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 389 – 400 123 To understand whether the TM40D - MB tumor cells possessed bone metastasis signatures , we compared gene expression proﬁle of highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells with that of low metastatic parental TM40D cells , using Affymetrix MG - U74v2 expression microarray chips con - taining * 13 , 000 genes . RNA samples extracted form TM40D and TM40D - MB cells were hybridised to the microarray chips , and normalised gene expression data were generated using the dCHIP software . The TM40D - MB data sets were compared with the baseline data set ( TM40D ) to obtain signiﬁcantly up - or down regulated genes , normalising data exported from the dChip software into the GeneSpring software in a scatter plot . The analysis of gene distribution showed no signiﬁcant outliers for any array and sample ( both \ 1 % ) , indicating no warnings for potential image contamination or sample hybridization problems were present ( data not shown ) . Therefore , all probe sets and arrays were included in the ﬁnal analysis . Among the genes identiﬁed by microarray , 20 genes that were consistently shown 4 fold or more changes were listed in Fig . 4 . To validate the data from Affymetrix array analysis , we chose 3 out of 20 identiﬁed candidates that had about 4 fold or more changes for further analysis . They were : COX2 , Fgf7 , and Ptx 3 . These candidate genes have been indicated to be involved in the bone remodelling and inﬂammatory responses . Oligomer primers for these target genes were designed to amplify these cDNA fragments , which were Fig . 3 Comparison of tumor progression and bone metastasis incidence between two groups of mice implanted with TM40D and TM40D - MB cells .

Data were analyzed by the Gene - Spring 5 . 0 . 3 array data analysis software ( Silicon Genetics , Redwood City , CA ) and were normalized in the dChip software ( Harvard School of Public Health and Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA ) Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 389 – 400 395 123 either used for the preparation of radioactive probes for the Northern blot analysis . The gene expressions of COX2 , Fgf7 , and Ptx 3 were easily detected by Northern blot analysis ( Fig . 5 ) . Their expressions in the TM40D - MB cells were much higher than that in the TM40D cells , which was consistent with the pattern of differential expression observed by the array analysis . We chose Cox2 gene for the initial test because Cox2’s role in prostaglandin synthesis and bone remodeling . We inserted the mouse COX2 full - length cDNA in a mam - malian expression vector in which the COX2 gene was directed by a constitutive promoter of elongation factor . This COX2 expression vector and an empty vector were transfected into the TM40D cells for the establishment of stable pool of clones , TM40D - COX2 and TM40D - C . Overexpression of COX2 gene in stable pool of transfec - tants was conﬁrmed by Northern blot analysis ( data not shown ) . We then chose one Cox2 high expression clone and a vector control TM40D - C and inoculated cells into the fat pads of BALB / c mice . All mice injected with tumor cells developed mammary tumors similar to that were inoculated with TM40D - MB and TM40D cells . These mice were maintained for the same period for tumor growth and were monitored for bone lesions by X - ray and were sac - riﬁced at end point using the same criteria as we did for mice inoculated with TM40D - MB and TM40D cells . However , of 20 mice injected with TM40D - Cox2 , only one mouse developed noticeable bone lesions as analyzed by histology . None of the ten mice inoculated with TM40D - C cells developed any bone lesions , suggesting that overex - pression of a single Cox2 gene does not cause a drastic increase of breast cancer bone metastasis , and Cox2 gene may affect one part of the complex process of bone metastasis . COX2 is involved in various inﬂammatory responses and in the prostaglandin synthesis , both of which are implicated in the bone remodeling [ 23 , 24 ] . We hypothe - size that TM40D - MB cells may promote tumor growth in bone partly through the overproduction of COX2 . To prove this , we injected TM40D - COX2 and TM40D - C into the femur of BALB / c female mice to observe the effect of COX2 expressing cells on bone remodeling . About 6 weeks after tumor inoculation , all femur samples that had been injected with TM40D - COX2 and TM40D - C were harvested for the analysis of trabecular bone volume by l CT scanning . Each femur sample was scanned for 300 slices , starting from the distal growth plate up towards the proximal end of the bone , and each slice was 12 microns . The trabecular bone volume in the 3 . 6 mm area was calculated for each sample . As shown in Fig . 6 , TM40D - COX2 caused signiﬁcantly more trabecular bone destruction compared to TM40D - C control in vivo ( P \ 0 . 02 ) . To further conﬁrm the role of COX2 in the osteolysis of bone , we performed in vitro osteoclastic formation assay by co - culturing the primary bone marrow cells isolated from the bone tissue of syngeneic BALB / c mice with TM40D - COX2 or TM40D - C cells . Our results showed that bone marrow cells co - cultured with TM40D - COX2 cells had an increased rate of osteoclast formation than those bone cells that were co - cultured with TM40D - C cells ( Fig . 7 ) . A Cox2 speciﬁc inhibitor NS - 398 speciﬁcally inhibited the ability of TM40D - COX2 to increase osteo - clastic formation ( Fig . 7b ) . This data suggests that overexpression of COX2 may contribute to the increase of osteoclastic bone lesion during breast cancer metastasis . It has been reported that the biosynthesis of postaglan - dins , such as prostaglandin E2 ( or PGE2 ) , is induced by COX2 . PGE2 itself is a powerful stimulator of osteoclast formation [ 23 , 24 ] . The PGE2 can bind to the PGE receptor ( EP4 ) and induce the expression of RANKL in osteoblastic cells . Secreted RANKL then acts on the osteoclast cells to stimulate bone resorption [ 25 ] . We hypothesize that TM40D - COX2 cells may promote osteoclastic bone lesion by increasing PGE2 production of tumor cells . We mea - sured the production of PGE2 in TM40D - COX2 , TM40D - C , and the highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells by a PGE2 ELISA assay , using an EIA kit from Cayman Chemical , Inc . Not surprisingly , TM40D - COX2 cells produced sev - eral folds of increased level of PGE2 compared to TM40D - C cells ( Fig . 7d ) . TM40D - MB cells also had a high expression of PGE2 as compared to TM40D - C . Incubation of TM40D - COX2 cells with NS - 398 , which speciﬁcally inhibits COX2 , also blocked the production of PGE2 ( Fig . 7d ) . This result , together with the data in Fig . 6 and Fig . 7a – c , indicates that COX2 mediates in part the osteoclastic lesions during breast cancer bone metastasis .

Bars were from stand errors 396 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 389 – 400 123 Discussion To study bone tumor metastasis one needs an appropriate animal model . Previously , an animal model has been established for the research of bone metastasis which involves inoculating human breast cancer MDA - MB - 231 cells to immunocompromised mice through left cardiac ventricle injection [ 23 , 26 ] . The efﬁciency for generating bone osteoclastic lesion using MDA - MB - 231 is around 30 % [ 14 , 27 ] . Another model of breast cancer bone metastasis is the 4T1 . 2 mouse mammary tumor model . In 4T1 . 2 model , mammary tumor cells were implanted to the mammary gland of syngeneic BALB / c mice and mammary tumors metastasized to bone with 100 % efﬁ - ciency [ 28 ] . Here , we present a new model of bone metastasis in which the TM40D - MB tumors give rise to bone metastasis with a rate of 53 % of efﬁciency , which falls between MDA - MB - 231 and 4T1 models . It is important to compare the gene expression signatures between these three different models , which may likely generate information about common pathways for breast cancer bone metastasis . Tumor metastasis is an inefﬁcient process . We reason that in the parental TM40D mammary tumor cells there might be only a very small subset of tumor cells that possesses the molecular signature for bone metastasis . It is conceivable that a majority of tumor cells will be killed by the immune defense system non - selectively during the process of metastasis , regardless whether the tumor cells have bone metastasis signature or not . Thus , if primary tumors have a high population of tumor cells with bone metastasis signature , there will be a higher possibility for these cells to escape and colonize to the bone . Based on this hypothesis , we pre - selected a population of mammary tumors with bone metastasis signatures ( TM40D - MB ) . When these tumor cells developed palpable primary tumors within the mammary gland , a high percentage of these mammary tumor - bearing mice developed bone metastasis spontaneously ( Fig . 3 ) . This study suggests that populations of cells with bone metastasis signature are present in mouse mammary tumor TM40D cells . This observation is in line with other studies which also sug - gested that a small portion of primary tumor cells might have existing molecular signatures for metastasis [ 5 , 6 ] . Fig . 6 l CT analysis of osteoclastic lesions in mice implanted with TM40D - COX2 and TM40D - C cells . Six BALB / c mice were implanted with TM40D - COX2 cells and ten mice were implanted with TM40D - C cells . The femur samples were harvested and scanned by l CT ( 300 slices , 12 micron / slice ) , starting from the distal growth plate up towards the proximal end of the bone ( CT scanned distance is 3 . 6 mm ) . Panel ( a – b ) representative views of femur trabecular bone . ( a ) Femur sample from TM40D - COX2 inoculated mouse , ( b ) femur sample from TM40D - C inoculated mouse . Note the decreased trabecular bone volume in TM40D - COX2 inoculated sample . ( c ) Summary of l CT analysis . The trabecular bone volumes ( mm 3 ) from l CT scanning were obtained from the computer and data from all samples were analyzed by two - tailed t - Test program for statistical analysis . There was a signiﬁcant decreased bone volume in TM40D - COX2 inoculated femur samples . Bars were from standard errors Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 389 – 400 397 123 In order to identify the molecular signature of bone metastasis , we compared gene expression proﬁle of two populations of cells with different metastatic potential . We showed that several clusters of gene ontology were either up - or down - regulated in the highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells ( Fig . 4 ) . We decided to choose three genes , COX2 , Fgf7 , and Ptx 3 for validation of micro - array data . These genes were differentially expressed for about 4 fold or above 4 fold in gene expression between TM40D - MB and TM40D cells . Early reports suggest that these genes may participate in bone remodeling directly or indirectly through modulating the inﬂammatory response in bone tissue [ 23 , 24 , 29 – 35 ] . For example , Cox2 is involved in the prostaglandin synthesis and is associated with bone remodeling [ 30 , 36 ] . Cross talk between Fgf and STAT / Jak signaling pathway plays a role in bone development [ 33 , 34 ] . The patterns of differential expression for these three genes in TM40D and TM40D - MB cells were veriﬁed by Northern blot analysis . They showed exactly the same expression patterns as that had been identiﬁed by the microarray analysis , conﬁrming the consistency of our microarray analysis . We chose COX2 gene for further functional study . Our data showed that overexpression of Cox2 alone did not directly induce increased bone metastasis in TM40D Fig . 7 Osteoclast formation assays from co - cultures of bone marrow cells and breast cancer cells and analysis of PGE2 concentrations .

Five randomly selected ﬁelds at the same pixel size for each well were observed under the microscope ( · 200 ) and the numbers of deﬁned osteoclasts were counted . The average number of osteoclasts in each well was determined based on the data from ﬁve independent ﬁelds . The experiment was repeated three times and bars were from the triplicate numbers . Note that co - culture of TM40D - COX2 signiﬁ - cantly increased the number of osteoclasts ( * P \ 0 . 01 ) and treatment of COX2 inhibitor NS - 398 at 1 · 10 – 5 M blocked the effect of COX2 on osteoclast formation . ( d ) PGE2 concentrations in conditioned media harvested from TM40D - C , TM40D - Cox2 , and TM40D - MB cells measured by ELISA assay as described in the Experimental Procedure . For each kind of cells , medium solutions were collected from ﬁve different plates for the assay . ELISA assays were repeated three times and data were analyzed with a statistical t - Test program . * P \ 0 . 001 , * * P \ 0 . 01 . Bars were from standard errors 398 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 389 – 400 123 mouse model . This is not surprising since bone metastasis is a complicated process that requires multiple genes and cell - cell interactions , and Cox2 may only be one of the components . A previous study by Kang et al . also found that a combination of multiple genes contributed to tumor bone metastasis in MDA - MB - 231 model [ 27 ] . From the published literature presented below , we propose that COX2 is a metastasis signature gene that functions in the same pathway as other signature genes in the MDA - MB - 231 bone metastasis model . One recent study showed that COX2 was positive in cancer cells in bone metastases in 13 of 15 human patient cases [ 37 ] . In nude mice study , stimulation of COX2 expression in MDA - 231 cells by done - derived TGF - b enhanced bone metastasis of breast cancer [ 37 ] . In another previous report , Kang et al . iden - tiﬁed IL - 11 as the key important gene involved in breast cancer bone metastasis [ 27 ] . However , it is known that IL - 11 is induced by another chemokine IL - 1 [ 38 ] , and COX2 is directly induced by IL - 1 [ 39 , 40 ] . IL - 11 functions to induce osteoclast formation through a PGE2 - dependent mechanism [ 38 ] . Our data indicate that overexpression of COX2 in low metastatic TM40D cells results in the increased production of PGE2 , which promotes osteoclast formation . Highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells , which cause osteoclastic lesions when they are implanted to BALB / c mice , also produce signiﬁcantly high level of PGE2 than low metastatic TM40D cells . Therefore , COX2 and IL - 11 both control PGE2 production . PGE2 - mediated bone resorption may represent one of the common bone metastasis pathway shared by both human and mouse models . This study leads the way to test selective COX2 inhibitor such as celecoxib for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis . In summary , we have established a spontaneous bone metastasis model of breast cancer . Microarray analysis from this study has identiﬁed a subset of genes that may represent the molecular signatures of bone metastasis for breast cancer . COX2 gene was identiﬁed and chosen for functional study . Our data indicate that overexpression of COX2 enhances osteoclastic lesions in breast cancer bone metastasis . Further functional studies of these signature genes using this mouse model should provide important insights about the molecular mechanism of bone metastasis and help to develop means to curb the metastasis process .
