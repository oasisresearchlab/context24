The impact of semantic distance and induced stress on analogical reasoning : A neurocomputational account Michael Vendetti & Barbara J . Knowlton & Keith J . Holyoak Published online : 16 June 2012 # Psychonomic Society , Inc . 2012 Abstract In a study of reasoning with four - term verbal analogy problems , we explored the relationship between the effects of an acute , mild stressor and the complexity of the reasoning process . Participants judged whether analogy problems in the form A : B : : C : D were valid or invalid , on the basis of whether the relation in the A : B term matched that in the C : D term . Half of the problems contained a C : D pair semantically near the A : B pair ( e . g . , NOSE : SCENT : : TONGUE : TASTE ) , and the other half contained ones semantically far from A : B ( e . g . , NOSE : SCENT : : ANTENNA : SIGNAL ) . After an initial block without stress , participants were randomly assigned to count backward by 13 s from 1 , 000 while being told to go faster , or to count forward by 1 s from 0 . The stress - induced participants reported a significant increase in state anxiety as compared to controls immediately after the mental arithmetic task . Stressed participants performed less accurately ( as measured by d ' ) on both near and far analogy problems , mainly due to an increase in false alarms . We were able to model the influence of semantic distance using the “ learning and inference with schemas and analogies ” ( LISA ) model . Our findings in - dicated that even mild increases in stress impair analog - ical reasoning . However , the decrement does not seem to directly involve the integration of relations , but rather is due to a shift in decision strategy : Under stress , people show an increased tendency to endorse analogies as valid when the terms in the individual pairs are semantically related to each other , even if the overall analogical rela - tionship is not valid . Keywords Anxiety . Decision - making . Computational model . Working memory . Prefrontal cortex Stress and cognitive processes In real - world situations , complex reasoning must often be performed under conditions that evoke acute stress . Acute stress has been shown to negatively impact a variety of cognitive processes , including memory ( Ishizuka , Hellier , & Beversdorf , 2007 ; Koessler , Engler , & Riether , 2009 ) , decision - making ( Preston , Stansfield , & Buchanan , 2007 ; Lighthall , Mather , & Gorlick , 2008 ; Porcelli & Delgado , 2009 ; Starcke , Wolf , & Markowitsch , 2008 ) , mental arith - metic ( Beilock & Carr , 2005 ) , and fluid reasoning ( Gimmig , Huguet , & Caverni , 2006 ) . The larger literature on the relationship between induced stress and working memory performance ( Arnsten , 2000 ; Arnsten & Goldman - Rakic , 1998 ; Beilock & Carr , 2005 ; Bishop , 2007 ; Derekshan & Eysenck , 2009 ; Fales et al . , 2008 ; Gimmig et al . , 2006 ; Kern , Oakes , & Stone , 2008 ) is consistent with the interpretation that stress impairs func - tion of the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) . One type of cognitive process that has not been exten - sively investigated with respect to induced stress is analog - ical reasoning . Analogical reasoning allows comparisons between featurally dissimilar situations to be performed on the basis of structural relationships ( for recent reviews , see Gentner , 2010 ; Halford , Wilson , & Phillips , 2010 ; Holyoak , 2012 ) . Analogical reasoning plays an important role in many cognitive tasks , including problem solving ( Gick & Holyoak , 1980 ) , developing scientific theories ( Dunbar & M . Vendetti ( * ) : B . J . Knowlton : K . J . Holyoak Department of Psychology , University of California , 405 Hilgard Avenue , Los Angeles , CA 90095 - 1563 , USA e - mail : michael . vendetti @ ucla . edu Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci ( 2012 ) 12 : 804 – 812 DOI 10 . 3758 / s13415 - 012 - 0103 - 0 Klahr , 2012 ; Holyoak & Thagard , 1995 ) , guiding consumer decisions ( Markman & Loewenstein , 2010 ) , and teaching mathematics ( Richland , Zur , & Holyoak , 2007 ) . It is there - fore an important goal to investigate the mechanisms of analogical reasoning , including the possible impact of fac - tors such as stress . Reasoning with verbal analogies A classic type of problem that can be used to assess analogical reasoning is proportional verbal analogies of the form A : B : : C : D ( e . g . , FATHER : SON : : INVENTOR : INVENTION ) . In these four - term analogy problems , the reasoner must extract the relationship between the pair of concepts that comprise A : B and then evaluate whether a corresponding relation holds between the C : D pair . For example , for the pair FATHER : SON , one salient relation - ship is that FATHER produces a SON . The “ produce ” relationship allows a systematic mapping to be estab - lished between FATHER and INVENTOR ( both pro - ducers ) and between SON and INVENTION ( both products ) , indicating that the analogy is valid . Impor - tantly , this type of “ semantically distant ” analogy is more difficult to solve ( as measured by either errors or response times ) than a problem in which the concept pairs are more similar ( e . g . , FATHER : SON : : MOTHER : DAUGHTER ; Green , Kraemer , & Fugelsang , 2010 , 2012 ) . Verbal analogy problems have a long history as psycho - metric measures of individual differences in analogical rea - soning ability ( Spearman , 1923 , 1946 ) . They have also figured prominently in both behavioral studies of the sour - ces of difficulty in analogical reasoning ( Green , Fugelsang , & Dunbar , 2006a ; Morrison et al . , 2004 ; Sternberg , 1977 ; Sternberg & Nigro , 1980 ) and in neuroimaging studies aiming to identify the neural substrates of such reasoning ( Bunge , Helskog , & Wendelken , 2009 ; Bunge & Wendelken , 2009 ; Bunge , Wendelken , & Badre , 2005 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012 ; Krawczyk , McClelland , & Donovan , 2011 ) . A general conclusion from the neuroimaging work has been that extract - ing and comparing relations between dissimilar pairs of objects ( as in the above FATHER : SON : : INVENTOR : IN - VENTION example ) selectively activates the left rostrolateral PFC ( for a review , see Knowlton & Holyoak , 2009 ) . Using a task that required identifying corresponding objects in two visual scenes presented simultaneously , Tohill and Holyoak ( 2000 ) found that stress ( induced by performing a prior difficult arithmetic task ) led to a shift from mapping on the basis of a common relation ( e . g . , choosing a tree as the match to a boy because both re - strained a dog ) to mapping on the basis of a more direct featural overlap ( e . g . , choosing a man as the match to the boy ) . This decrement in analogical mapping due to induced stress occurred even when participants were given a practice example showing that the relational map was the correct response . The negative impact of stress on relation - based mapping might reflect reduced working memory capacity under stress and / or a reduction in the ability to control interference from featural distractors ( Cho , Holyoak , & Cannon , 2007 ; Cho et al . , 2010 ) . Importantly , in Tohill and Holyoak ’ s study , participants did not receive any feed - back indicating that featural mappings were incorrect . It is therefore possible that those in the stressed condition may simply have elected to use the simpler strategy of reporting featural rather than relational matches . To the extent that the process of integrating relations in analogical reasoning depends on PFC function , induced stress may affect one ’ s ability to integrate relations , perhaps inducing a shift to a heuristic strategy based more on se - mantic similarity . For example , an invalid verbal analogy such as FATHER : SON : : NEPHEW : COUSIN may be a “ tempting lure , ” especially under stress , because the salient pairwise relations ( FATHER is a relative of SON , NEPHEW is a relative of COUSIN ) support a positive decision . Thus , stress may increase the rate of false alarms to invalid anal - ogies that involve salient semantic relationships within the A : B and C : D pairs . In the present study , we investigated how stress impacts analogical reasoning with four - term verbal analogy prob - lems . We used materials developed by Green et al . ( 2010 ; see also Green et al . , 2012 ) , in which the semantic distance of the C : D pair relative to the A : B pair was varied . Green et al . found that as semantic distance increased ( e . g . , FATHER : SON : : MOTHER : DAUGHTER vs . FATHER : SON : : IN - VENTOR : INVENTION ) , accuracy declined and solution times increased . These behavioral changes were accompa - nied by an increase in BOLD activity within the left fronto - polar cortex , an area that is typically associated with relational integration ( Bunge et al . , 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . , 2006b ) . By varying semantic distance within analogy problems , with or without induced stress , we sought to discriminate between alternative hypotheses concerning the mechanism by which stress may impact analogical reasoning . If stress impairs the capacity to perform relational integration ( perhaps by reducing the processing efficiency of the rostrolateral PFC ) , we would expect to observe greater performance defi - cits under stress for problems involving high semantic dis - tance . Alternatively , stress may trigger a more global strategy shift toward basing positive responses on the detection of individual semantic relationships between concepts . Given that the foils always involved closely related concepts within both A : B and C : D pairs , such a strategy shift would be expected to lead to a general increase in false alarms , inde - pendent of the semantic distance between the A : B and C : D pairs . Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci ( 2012 ) 12 : 804 – 812 805 Method Participants A group of 58 undergraduates ( 48 female , 10 male ) at the University of California , Los Angeles , participated for par - tial credit toward the requirements of an undergraduate psychology class . Informed written consent was obtained for each participant according to the ethical guidelines established by the UCLA Office of Human Research Pro - tection Program . Design , materials , and procedure The design of the study was a 2 ( group : to - be - stressed vs . no - stress control ) × 2 ( time : before stress induction vs . control / after stress induction ) × 2 ( semantic distance : near vs . far analogy trials ) × 2 ( validity : valid vs . invalid analogy trials ) . The induced - stress manipulation was a between - subjects variable ; the other three factors were manipulated within subjects . The verbal analogy problems were modified versions of those used by Green et al . ( 2010 ) . There were a total of 120 analogy problems , each consisting of four words in an A : B : : C : D format . Following Green et al . ( 2010 ) , problems were subdivided into four types : valid near ( 40 problems ) , valid far ( 40 ) , invalid near ( 20 ) , and invalid far ( 20 ) . Valid trials were those for which the A : B relationship was proportional to that of the C : D pair . Near trials were those for which the C : D concepts were drawn from a category semantically similar to that of the A : B pair . For example , if the A : B term was NOSE : SCENT , a near C : D term could be TONGUE : TASTE . Far trials were those for which the C : D concepts were drawn from a different semantic category than the A : B terms ( e . g . , NOSE : SCENT : : ANTENNA : SIGNAL ) . ( For more detailed infor - mation about the stimuli , see Green et al . , 2010 . ) Participants were tested individually . During the in - formed consent process , participants read that the experi - ment would be measuring how performance on analogy problems relates to mental arithmetic ability . Participants were informed that in addition to solving analogy problems , they would also be performing a mental arithmetic task . Participants then were asked to fill out the State – Trait Anx - iety Inventory ( STAI ; Spielberger , Gorsuch , & Lushene , 1970 ) . After this , all participants were brought into the testing room , which consisted of a desk , two chairs , and a computer that controlled the presentation of analogy prob - lems . The computer was a Mac Mini Intel , using Mac OS 10 . 5 and connected to a 17 - in . CRT monitor , and the exper - iment was presented using Superlab ( Cedrus Corp . , 2004 ) . After having read the instructions , participants went through three analogy practice trials with feedback along with the experimenter . Each trial began with a brief fixation cross , followed by presentation of the A : B and C : D pairs , with the A : B pair appearing on the monitor above the C : D pair . Participants were instructed to press a key with their right index finger if the analogy was valid and to hit a different key with their left index finger if the analogy was invalid . They were instructed to solve each trial as quickly and accurately as possible . Feedback was provided under two conditions : if either the participant made the wrong decision or 8 s had elapsed before a decision was made . If the participant ’ s choice was wrong , the screen displayed “ Wrong ! ” ; if the participant took too long , the screen displayed “ Too Slow ! ” Both types of feedback were shown centered in red font for 1 s , after which the next trial began . There were no differences in the amounts of feedback between the two groups for either Block 1 [ F ( 1 , 55 ) < 1 , p > . 10 ] or Block 2 [ F ( 1 , 55 ) 0 1 . 4 , p > . 10 ] . Two blocks of trials were administered . Each block contained a 2 : 1 ratio of valid to invalid trials . The propor - tions of near and far problems were equal within each block . The first block comprised 39 analogy trials . Neither group received any special instructions prior to Block 1 . Following completion of Block 1 , the participants were asked to per - form a mental arithmetic task . For participants who were assigned to the to - be stressed group , the mental arithmetic task was actually a modified version taken from the Trier Social Stress Test ( TSST ; Hopko , Ashcraft , & Gute , 1998 ; Kellogg , Hopko , & Ashcraft , 1999 ; Kirschbaum , Pirke , & Hellhammer , 1993 ) . Specifically , their task was to count backward , out loud , starting from 1 , 000 and subtracting 13 ( “ 1 , 000 , 987 , ” etc . ) . During participants ’ attempts to per - form this mental arithmetic task , every 10 s they were told by the experimenter to go faster . Each time an error was made , the experimenter instructed the participant to start over . Participants in the stressed condition were unaware of how long they would have to complete this task , but all participants were told to stop after 1 min . They were then warned that they would have to perform a similar mental arithmetic task later on in the experimental session . This warning was included to induce a stronger sense of worry about their performance . ( The arithmetic task was not in fact repeated . ) In contrast , participants assigned to the control condition ( no stress ) were simply asked to count forward by one starting from zero for the same amount of time , with no interruption by the experimenter or expectation of an addi - tional arithmetic test later . Immediately after the mental arithmetic task , partici - pants in both groups were asked to fill out the State form of the STAI ( i . e . , a second assessment of stress was obtained ) . They then completed the second block of analogy problems . Block 2 comprised 78 trials of the same types of problems as had been administered in Block 1 . After finishing Block 2 , all participants completed 806 Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci ( 2012 ) 12 : 804 – 812 the State form of the STAI for a third time . Following this , they were thanked for their participation in the study and fully debriefed . Results Trait and state anxiety scores The mean trait and state scores for the two conditions are shown in Fig . 1 . Trait anxiety scores were collected at the beginning of the study and provided a check that the partic - ipants randomly assigned to the two conditions had similar levels of trait anxiety as measured by the STAI ( Spielberger et al . , 1970 ) . The conditions did not differ significantly in trait anxiety scores : control ( n 0 28 , M 0 36 . 93 ) , to - be - stressed ( n 0 29 , M 0 35 . 21 ) , t ( 55 ) 0 0 . 79 , p 0 . 435 . The trait anxiety scores for both groups were well within the normal range for young adults ( norm M 0 35 . 85 ; Spielberger et al . , 1970 ) . As described above , state anxiety scores were collected at three points during the study : ( 1 ) immediately before admin - istration of the trait anxiety subscale , ( 2 ) immediately after the mental arithmetic task that followed completion of Block 1 , and ( 3 ) after completing Block 2 . A 2 ( control vs . to - be - stressed ) × 3 ( time of state anxiety test ) mixed - subjects ANOVA yielded a significant interaction , F ( 2 , 112 ) 0 9 . 21 , MSE 0 58 . 95 , p < . 001 . Follow - up independent t tests for each state assessment time point yielded a significant difference between the groups only at the second assessment time , im - mediately after completing the mental arithmetic task , t ( 55 ) 0 4 . 43 , p < . 001 . These results confirm that the stress induction procedure succeeded in increasing state anxiety scores for the to - be - stressed group , with the level returning to baseline by the conclusion of Block 2 . Performance on analogy task We will report analyses based on accuracy , as response times did not reveal any influence of the stress manipula - tion . The main analyses were performed on d ' scores , cal - culated separately for the near and far problem types . In calculating d ' for individual participants , scores at one of the extremes ( 0 or 1 ) were replaced by 0 . 5 / n or ( n – 0 . 5 ) / n , respectively , where n 0 number of trials ( Stanislaw & Todorov , 1999 ) . The results are shown in Fig . 2 . We per - formed a 2 ( Block 1 vs . Block 2 ) × 2 ( semantic distance ) × 2 ( group ) ANOVA on the d ' scores . As is shown in Fig . 2 , we found a main effect of block , such that d ' was significantly greater in Block 1 ( M 0 3 . 32 ) than in Block 2 ( M 0 2 . 90 ) , F ( 1 , 56 ) 0 6 . 16 , MSE 0 1 . 67 , p 0 . 016 . A main effect of semantic distance was also obtained , with d ' significantly greater for near problems ( M 0 3 . 68 ) than for far problems ( M 0 2 . 55 ) , F ( 1 , 56 ) 0 35 . 47 , MSE 0 2 . 12 , p < . 001 . Most importantly , a reliable Block × Group interaction was obtained , F ( 1 , 56 ) 0 5 . 54 , MSE 0 1 . 668 , p 0 . 022 . Follow - up t tests revealed no reliable differences in d ' scores be - tween the two groups in Block 1 ( control , M 0 3 . 29 ; to - be - stressed , M 0 3 . 36 ) , t ( 55 ) 0 0 . 17 , p 0 . 868 . However , the two groups did differ reliably on Block 2 , after the stress manip - ulation ( control , M 0 3 . 27 ; stressed , M 0 2 . 54 ) , t ( 55 ) 0 2 . 29 , p 0 . 027 . The three - way interaction among block , group , and semantic distance was not reliable , p > . 05 . In addition to calculating d ' scores on the basis of signal detection theory , we also calculated the corresponding bias scores . If the difference in accuracy between the two con - ditions in Block 2 were solely due to a change in bias , we would expect the stressed condition to yield a greater overall proportion of “ yes ” responses ( i . e . , an increase in hits as well in false alarms ) . However , the two groups did not differ reliably in an ANOVA based on bias scores for Block 2 , F ( 1 , 56 ) 0 1 . 08 , p > . 10 .

Error bars indicate ±1 SEM Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci ( 2012 ) 12 : 804 – 812 807 As is shown in Fig . 3 , the difference in d ' s between the two groups across blocks was in fact mainly due to an increase in false alarms across both levels of semantic dis - tance for participants in the stressed group as compared to those in the control group . ( The proportions of hits on valid trials are not reliably different between groups . ) We ran a multiple regression analysis on false alarms produced in Block 2 using the false alarm rate in Block 1 as one predic - tor , with the change in participant state anxiety scores be - tween Time Points 1 and 2 as an additional predictor . This analysis revealed that , controlling for initial false alarm rates in Block 1 , a positive relationship still remained between changes in state anxiety scores and false alarms in Block 2 , F ( 1 , 53 ) 0 17 . 12 , MSE 0 0 . 011 , p < . 001 . LISA simulation of verbal analogy performance We modeled our results using the “ learning and inference with schemas and analogies ” ( LISA ) model ( Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 , 2003 ) , a symbolic – connectionist model of analogical mapping . LISA uses a hierarchical structure to represent objects and to predicate relations within each pair of the analogy . The lowest level contains semantic units that represent features of each of the concepts within an ana - logue [ for our simulations , simple propositions such as produce ( father , son ) ] , with separate pools of units for objects ( e . g . , father , son ) and for roles ( e . g . , producer , produced ) . For example , the objects father and son might be coded by distributed patterns across semantic units such as [ human , adult , child , male ] , while the roles producer and produced might be coded by patterns across semantic units such as [ action , generative ] . The upper levels of the hierar - chy comprise various types of structure units that represent the components of propositions . These include units for objects and roles , as well as role - binding ( RB ) units that link objects to the appropriate roles ( e . g . , father + producer , son + produced ) . Finally , the highest level is a proposition ( P ) unit that binds multiple RB units into a complete proposition . As sketched in Fig . 4 , we modeled the verbal analogy task by coding the A : B and C : D pairs as two separate analogues and then mapping the former ( in the terms of the LISA model , the driver ) to the latter ( the recipient ) . The model operates by updating mapping connections ( not illustrated ) that capture the correspondences between the components of the two analogues ( i . e . , forming connections between the objects A and C and between B and D , as well as between the corresponding role and RB units ) . As a simple index of the overall “ goodness ” of the mapping between the analogues , we used a similarity score developed for LISA by Taylor and Hummel ( 2010 , p . 232 , Eq . 5 ) that is sensitive to both the relational and featural overlap between analogues ( the “ total similarity score ” ) . We made the as - sumption that the probability of responding “ yes ” to an analogy problem will increase with LISA ’ s similarity score . ( For more detail on the operation of LISA , see Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 , 2003 ; Taylor & Hummel , 2009 . ) Our aim was to model the three major effects identified in the behavioral data summarized in Fig . 3 : ( 1 ) For both conditions , the proportion of “ yes ” responses was greater for valid than for invalid problems ; ( 2 ) for both conditions , the proportion of “ yes ” responses was greater for near than for far problems ; and ( 3 ) the stressed group gave more “ yes ” responses for invalid problems than did the control condi - tion . In order to evaluate the LISA model ’ s sensitivity to the first two factors , we created four simulations : near valid , far valid , near invalid , and far invalid analogies , representing the four basic problem types . For all simulations , the A and B ( and C and D ) concepts were created so as to have 50 % overlap across semantic units , reflecting the close semantic similarity between the concepts within each pair . Valid trials were constructed by including identical predicates in the source and target analogues ( e . g . , if produces was the pred - icate for FATHER : SON , produces was also the predicate for INVENTOR : INVENTION ) . Invalid trials , by their very na - ture , required predicates that differed . Near problems were created with more overlap of semantic units among the objects and roles comprising the A : B and C : D pairs , as compared to the far problems ( approximately 60 % and 45 % overlap , respectively ) . We first applied the LISA model to the control condition to see whether it could account for the basic effects of validity and semantic distance . All of the parameters were fixed at their default values ( see Hummel & Holyoak , 2003 , Appx . A ) , and the total similarity score ( Taylor & Hummel , 2010 ) was calculated . Figure 5 shows the proportions of Fig . 3 Proportions of “ yes ” responses ( i . e . , hits for valid analogy trials and false alarms for invalid trials ) , by semantic distance ( near vs . far ) and condition , after the stress manipulation ( i . e . , in Block 2 ) . Error bars indicate ±1 SEM 808 Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci ( 2012 ) 12 : 804 – 812 “ yes ” responses across the four problem types for the con - trol condition along with LISA ’ s predictions ( based on a linear rescaling of the similarity scores to fit the human data ) . The model was able to account for 98 % of the variance among the four conditions , thus capturing both the basic effect of validity and also the semantic distance effect ( Green et al . , 2010 ) . We next explored possible approaches to simulating the impact of stress on the proportions of “ yes ” responses ( see Fig . 3 ) . In previous simulation work , LISA has been used to model the impact of frontal damage , by varying its parame - ters for inhibition and for learning mapping connections ( Morrison et al . , 2004 ) ; to model the impact of normal aging , by varying its inhibition parameter ( Viskontas , Morrison , & Holyoak , 2004 ) ; and to model developmental changes , also by varying the inhibition parameter ( Morrison , Doumas , & Richland , 2011 ) . However , in all of these previous simula - tions , a key qualitative finding was a change in the ability to solve problems at higher levels of relational complexity . In the present study , the semantic distance factor can be viewed as a type of complexity manipulation , as supported by the fact that higher semantic distance is known to increase the activation of rostrolateral PFC ( Green et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . However , we found that stress did not selectively impair performance with far problems . Rather , the empirical finding was that stress increased the false alarm rate for invalid problems at both levels of semantic distance , while having a negligible impact on hit rates ( see Fig . 3 ) . Not surprisingly , given the fact that stress did not interact with semantic distance in the present experiment , we found that its impact could not be captured by manipulating LISA ’ s inhibition or learning rate parameters , as both types of changes inherently yield such an interaction . These negative findings based on the LISA model imply that the impact of stress is not to directly impair relational processing , but rather to trigger a general shift in decision strategy . Specifically , it seemed plau - sible that under stress , participants might sometimes respond “ yes ” simply because the concepts within each pair ( A : B and also C : D ) are closely related . To model this possibility , we tested a simple model that predicts how the choice between two alternative strategies for solving analogy problems Fig . 4 Modeling the verbal analogy task in the LISA model . Each proposition within the analogy consists of a set of hierarchical units used to represent the concepts in each pair as well as their relationships Fig . 5 Proportions of “ yes ” responses ( i . e . , hits for valid trials and false alarms for invalid trials ) as a function of semantic distance ( near vs . far ) for the control ( no - stress ) condition in Block 2 , along with predictions derived from the LISA model ( see the text ) for more details . Error bars indicate ±1 SEM Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci ( 2012 ) 12 : 804 – 812 809 ( responding based on how proportional the relations between the A : B and C : D pairs are vs . responding on the basis of semantic similarity within each pair ) may be influenced by the impact of stress . Specifically , we assumed that with prob - ability p ( estimated by the LISA prediction for the control condition ) , stressed participants respond on the basis of ana - logical mapping , and with probability 1 – p , they simply respond “ yes ” due to the featural similarity within each pair of concepts [ i . e . , probability of “ yes ” response under stress 0 p ( LISA prediction for control ) + ( 1 – p ) ] . A regression analysis revealed that this model accounted for 95 % of the variance in “ yes ” responses across the four conditions for the to - be - stressed condition ( with the value of p equal to . 90 ) . Thus , the most successful computational account of the impact of acute stress on analogy performance in our experiment was that , on a small proportion of trials , stress induces a shift to a nonanalogical decision strategy . Discussion In the present study , we found that mild induced stress had a different influence on analogical reasoning than did a variation in the complexity of verbal analogy problems ( the semantic distance between A : B and C : D pairs ) . In accord with previous findings ( Green et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) , increasing semantic distance decreased hits and increased false alarms . In contrast , inducing stress led to an in - crease in false alarms without decreasing hits . Moreover , no interaction was observed between the influences of semantic distance and stress on solution accuracy . This pattern suggests that stress did not impair the capacity to integrate relations , which would presumably be more difficult in the far semantic condition . Rather , the present findings indicate that stress has its impact at the level of the decision process , encouraging a strategy of making positive responses based on the fact that the individual word pairs are semantically related . From the neuroimag - ing literature concerning analogical reasoning ( Bunge et al . , 2005 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) , one would suspect that to the extent that stress induction reduces the likeli - hood of relational integration , less activation in rostro - lateral PFC areas would be observed for both near and far analogies relative to control conditions . The LISA model ( Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 , 2003 ) , a symbolic – connectionist model of analogical mapping , was able to capture the semantic distance effect . By manipulat - ing the amount of semantic overlap between the A : B and C : D terms in LISA representations , a similarity measure de - rived from LISA ( Taylor & Hummel , 2010 ) was able to explain 98 % of the variance in analogy selections by participants in the control condition . The changes in selec - tions that accompanied stress could be accounted for by a model in which , on a small proportion of trials , stressed participants were assumed to give a positive response re - gardless of the actual validity of the analogy problem . These modeling results have implications for understand - ing how stress impacts the ability to solve verbal analogies . Under stress , a reasoner is more likely to use a simpler decision strategy , endorsing an invalid analogy due to the semantic similarity between the items in each of its individ - ual word pairs . In view of the present findings , we hypoth - esize that participants in the stressed condition of Tohill and Holyoak ( 2000 ) may have been capable of performing rela - tional mapping , but instead , more often opted for a strategy of identifying object correspondences on the basis of fea - tural similarity . An important direction for future research will be to examine individual differences in the effects of stress on analogical reasoning . For example , previous findings have shown that individuals who score higher on working mem - ory measures suffer more on math and inductive reasoning problems when under stress ( Beilock & Carr , 2005 ; Gimmig et al . , 2006 ) . It may be that inducing stress would have a greater impact on analogical reasoning for those individuals with greater working memory span . Our results raise the possibility that , while high - span individuals may generally perform better on analogical reasoning tasks , they may also have a greater tendency under stress to shift to a heuristic strategy based on the similarity within pairs . In conclusion , the present study provides evidence concerning how induced stress may impact the ability to reason using analogies . Specifically , we found that induced stress led to a selective increase in false alarms in evaluating invalid analogy problems , apparently due to a tendency to use a simpler decision strategy . Unlike a number of other factors known to impair analogical reasoning , such as pre - frontal damage ( Morrison et al . , 2004 ) and normal aging ( Viskontas et al . , 2004 ) , mild induced stress may not neces - sarily impair one ’ s ability to integrate relations . Whereas these other factors clearly interact with the complexity of analogy problems , the impact of stress proved to be constant across simpler problems ( near semantic distance ) and more complex ones ( far semantic distance ) . If mild stress encourages a general shift to a simpler decision strategy , it would seem that its impact could be overcome by interventions that encourage continued focus on relational processing . The present findings thus may have important implications for developing methods to help cope with moderate levels of stress , of the sort that often occur in educational environments during examinations . Of course , the impact of stress may be qualitatively different at more extreme levels , such as those associated with anx - iety disorders , depression , and posttraumatic stress syn - drome , or with analogies that are substantially more complex than those used here . 810 Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci ( 2012 ) 12 : 804 – 812 Author note This research was supported by ONR Grant N000140810186 .
