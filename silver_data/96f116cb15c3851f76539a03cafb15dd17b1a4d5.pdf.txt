1 SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Expression Vectors pCDNA3 - HA - FBXO3 , pCAGGSnHC - MPHOSPH1 , pECFP - Cdk2 , pGL3 - HDM2 - luc and WWP - Luc ( p21 / WAF1 ) , pEGFP - Myo5c , pCDNA3 - DNMT2 - Myc - GIluc , and pCI - SKP1 - Myc were a gift from I . Kitabayashi , Y . Nakamura , R . Wolthuis , R . Agami , R . Bernards , R . Cheney , C . - L . Hsieh and J . Neefjes . pcDNA3 . 1 - Lip5 - Flag and pcDNA3 . 1 - Chmp5 - Flag were a gift from J . Kaplan . Luciferase Activity Assay Wild - type 293T cells ( 50 . 000 cells / well ) were plated in 24 - well plates . Conversely , 50 . 000 control knockdown and 70 . 000 FBXO3 knockdown cells were seeded in order to ensure a similar confluence at the time of transfection . The same was done for the FMN1 knockdown cells . One day after , cells were transfected with pGL3 - HDM2 - luc ( 100 ng ) and either pcDNA3 Flag - mDia2 wt or MA ( 400 ng ) , or the empty pCDNA3 Flag vector ( 400 ng ) . U2OS cells ( 80 . 000 cells / well ) were plated in 6 - well plates and , 16 hours later , co - transfected with pGL3 - HDM2 - luc ( 500 ng ) and either pcDNA3 Flag - mDia2 wt or MA ( 1000 ng ) with or without pCDNA3 - HA - FBXO3 ( 1000 ng ) . When pcDNA3 - HA - FBXO3 was absent , empty vector ( 1000 ng ) was added . In all experiments , independent triplicates were assayed and the Firefly Luciferase activity was measured 24 hours post - transfection with the Dual - Luciferase® Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) using an EnVision® Multilabel Reader ( PerkinElmer ) . Initially , we added HDM2 - Firefly luciferase - based reported and Renilla luciferase - based co - reported in a 1 : 10 ratio , which prevented trans effects between the two promoters ( not shown ) . Incomplete quenching of the Firefly luciferase and low Renilla luciferase activity affected the normalization of the samples and dampened the stimulatory 2 effects of mDia2 ( not shown ) . As total DNA amount and ratio between different plasmids were kept constant , we obtained very similar transfection efficiencies for different conditions and independent samples in both U2OS and 293T cells . Thus , the Firefly Luciferase activity was expressed as arbitrary units / µ g of total proteins . Results are normalized against the lowest value of the control samples and represented as relative HDM2 - promoter activities ( mean ± SD ) , as obtained from at least three independent experiments . Kinetics of Caspase - 3 / 7 activity U2OS cells were transfected in 6 - well plates , trypsinized immediately after transfection and seeded in either triplicates or quadruplicates in a 384 - well plate ( 1 . 200 cells / well ) or 96 - well plate ( 2000 - 3000 cells / well ) . After approximately one day , medium was replaced with fresh complete medium containing the Caspase - 3 / 7 substrate ( CellPlayer TM 96 - Well Caspase - 3 / 7 Apoptosis Assay Kit , Essen Bioscience ) . IncuCyte FLR / ZOOM ( Essen Bioscience ) was used to track apoptosis over time . Image acquisition , processing and analyses were done with the Object Counting Software Module ( Essen Bioscience ) . Apoptotic index was defined as the ratio between confluence of apoptotic objects and cell confluence and is expressed in arbitrary units . Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Analysis by FACS Cells were harvested by trypsinization , washed extensively with phosphate buffered saline and fixed in 70 % Ethanol . Prior to FACS analysis , cells were stained overnight with Fluorochrome solution ( 20 µ g / ml propidium iodide , 20 µ g / ml RNAse A , 0 . 1 % sodium citrate ( w / v ) , 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 ( v / v ) at 4°C in the dark . Samples were analysed for DNA content using a FACSCalibur . 3 qPCR Primers p53 ( TP53 ) : F _ AGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGAT , R _ CCCTTTTTGGACTTCAGGTG Cyclophillin ( PPID ) : F _ CATCTGCACTGCCAAGACTGA , R _ TTGCCAAACACCACATGCTT Bax ( BAX ) : F _ CAAGACCAGGGTGGTTGG , R _ TGGAGGAAAAACACAGTCCA p21 ( CDKN1A ) : F _ TACCCTTGTGCCTCGCTCAG , R _ GAGAAGATCAGCCGGCGTTT HDM2 ( MDM2 ) : F _ GAATCTACAGGGACGCATC , R _ TCCTTGATCCAACCAATCACC mDia2 ( DIAPH3 ) : F _ GCGGGAAAAGGACTTCAGTAT , R _ TCTGTCGGCTTCTCTTAAGACTTC DAAM1 ( DAAM1 ) : F _ GGAGCTACAAGTTGGCCTGA , R _ TCCTTCTCTAAAGCCAGCAGA DAAM2 ( DAAM2 ) : F _ CAAAGCCCAAAGTGGAAGC , R _ CATCTGTCTAAGACGCTTGCTG FHOD1 ( FHOD1 ) : F _ AGTCTCGTGCCAAAGAGGTG , R _ TCCAGCACTGTGGTCATTGT FHOD3 ( FHOD3 ) : F _ AGGCCAGGTTGGAAAGGT , R _ TCTGCTGCCAGTGACTCTTG FMNL1 ( FMNL1 ) : F _ CTACGCGCCATCATGAACT , R _ ACACAGGCTGGGTGGTTC FMNL2 ( FMNL2 ) : F _ TGTGGAACTGGAAAAGCAACT , R _ TGTGTGAACTTGAGTATTTGCATC 4 FMNL3 ( FMNL3 ) : F _ CCATCGAGGACATCATCACA , R _ CCGAGAGGGTCTCAGTGG INF1 ( FHDC1 ) : F _ GCATCATGTTCAGAAGACTGCTA , R _ TGTCCTGACAAACAGCAAGTG INF2 ( INF2 ) : F _ GAGGTCTTTGCCTCCCTGTT , R _ GACAGGAGCTGGGCAGAC FMN1 ( FMN1 ) : F _ GGCCCCTCTGATTCCAAA , R _ GCTTGAAGTCTGCCAGGAGT FMN2 ( FMN2 ) : F _ GCTTCCAGAACGTGTTCACAG , R _ ATCCGGGAGCAAAACTTCTC mDia1 ( DIAPH1 ) : F _ TTGGACATTCTTAAACGACTTCAT , R _ GCTTGTTCCGGCTATCGTAA mDia3 ( DIAPH2 ) : F _ TGCATTTTGAGAAGAACAAAGTG , R _ CCAGCTTATCTTGATCTTTGCAG
