The role of human dynamin in receptor - mediated endocytosis was investigated by transient ex - pression of GTP - binding domain mutants in mam - malian cells . Using assays which detect intermediates in coated vesicle formation , the dynamin mutants were found to block endocytosis at a stage after the initia - tion of coat assembly and preceding the sequestration of ligands into deeply invaginated coated pits . Mem - brane transport from the ER to the Golgi complex was unaffected indicating that dynamin mutants specifically block early events in endocytosis . These results dem - onstrate that mutations in the GTP - binding domain of dynamin block Tfn - endocytosis in mammalian cells and suggest that a functional dynamin GTPase is re - quired for receptor - mediated endocytosis via clathrin - coated pits . ECEPTOR - mediated endocytosis occurs via the forma - tion of clathrin - coated vesicles and involves coat as - sembly , receptor recruitment , coated pit invagina - tion , and finally vesicle budding ( Smythe and Warren , 1991 ; Robinson , 1992 ; Schmid , 1993 ) . The major structural pro - teins of the coat , clathrin , and AP complexes have been well characterized ( Pearse and Robinson , 1990 ; Keen , 1990 ; Brodsky , 1988 ) . While proteins that regulate coated vesicle formation have not been identified ( Schmid , 1992 ) , a cell - free assay which reconstitutes reeeptor - mediated endocyto - sis has recently revealed a requirement for multiple GTP - binding proteins ( Carter et al . , 1993 ) . Dynamin , a GTP - binding protein first isolated from bo - vine brain tissue ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ; Obar et al . , 1990 ; Scaife and Margolis , 1990 ; Nakata et al . , 1991 ) is a strong candidate for a GTPase that acts early in endocytosis . Dynamin is a member of a subfamily of structurally related GTP - binding proteins which share considerable sequence homology ( 43 - 66 % ) in the amino - terminal GTPase domain , but more limited homology ( < 10 - 30 % ) in their COOH - terminal regions . Other members of this family ( for review see Collins , 1991 ) include the mammalian Mx - 1 related , interferon - inducible proteins which confer viral resistance ( Arnheiter and Meier , 1990 ) , MGM1 which plays a role in yeast mitochondrial DNA maintenance ( Jones and Fang - man , 1992 ) and VPSlp , a protein involved in vacuolar sort - Please address all correspondence to Dr .

Whether these proteins have related functions or simply share a common GTPase domain driving divergent functions remains to be determined . Evidence for the role of dynamin in endocytosis came from the discovery that the Drosophila homologue of dyna - min is encoded by the shibire locus ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ; Chen et al . , 1991 ) . Adult flies with a mu - tation that causes the shibire gene product to be temperature sensitive exhibit rapid and reversible paralysis at elevated temperatures ( Grigliatti et al . , 1973 ) . Morphological analy - sis of nerve terminals from affected flies revealed a depletion of synaptic vesicles and an accumulation of membrane in - vaginations and coated pits at the cell surface ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ) . Other shibire - derived tissue and cell lines are similarly affected , demonstrating that the defect is pleiotropic . Results from the fluid - phase uptake of morphological tracers also suggest a specific defect in endocytosis but not secretion ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ; Tsuruhara et al . , 1990 ) . However , a direct role for dynamin in receptor - mediated endocytosis has not been demonstrated in either Drosophila or mam - malian cells . The phenotypic analysis of the shibire mutation and the identity of the shibire gene product as dynamin present a paradox . Dynamin has been characterized in vitro as a microtubule - stimulated GTPase and a putative microtubule - based mechanochemical motor protein ( Shpetner and Val - lee , 1989 ; 1992 ) , although the latter activity has not been reproduced with highly purified protein ( Maeda et al . , 1992 ) . Several studies have shown that polymerized microtubules are not required during the early stages of endocytosis ( Oka Â© The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 931081553111 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , Number 3 , August 1993 553 - 563 553 and Weigel , 1983 ; Morgan and Iacopetta , 1987 ) but are in - stead involved in later trafficking events along the endocytic pathway ( Matteioni and Kreis , 1987 ) . Thus , if dynamin is a microtubule - dependent GTPase , then the defect in early en - docytosis could be an indirect consequence of a block more distal in the endocytic pathway . This paradox can be resolved by identifying the specific stage where dynamin acts . To provide functional evidence for a direct role of dynamin in receptor - mediated endocytosis , we have used transient expression of mutant dynamin in HeLa cells . Receptor - mediated endocytosis of transferrin was followed using newly developed assays which enable detection of intermediates in coated vesicle formation . We show that transient expression of dynamin mutants containing an altered GTPase domain caused a marked decrease in the rate of endocytosis without affecting protein traffic along the exocytic pathway . Endocy - tosis was blocked at an intermediate stage in coated vesicle formation . These results provide the first biochemical evi - dence that dynamin is directly involved in receptor - mediated endocytosis and that the GTP - binding domain is required for its activity . Materials and Methods Materials Anti - Tfn receptor monoclonal antibody , D65 was a kind gift of I . S . Trow - bridge and S . White ( Salk Institute , San Diego , CA ) . Anti - clathrin mono - clonal antibody , X22 , and anti - c ~ - adaptin antibody , AP6 , were generous gifts of E M . Brodsky ( University of California , San Francisco ) . Human diferric transferrin ( Tfn ) 1 was biotinylated as previously described ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ) . All other reagents were obtained from Sigma Chem . Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Molecular Analysis and Preparation of Constructs A human dynamin cDNA fragment had previously been isolated using Dro - sophila cDNA as a heterolngous probe ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ) . This fragment was used to screen a cDNA library made from human temporal cortex ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) after standard protocols ( Sam - brook et al . , 1989 ) . The newly isolated cDNAs were characterized by se - quence analysis using oligonucleotides synthesized on a Cyclone Plus DNA synthesizer ( Milligen / Bioseareh ) and Sequenase ( Un . States Biochem . Corp . , Cleveland , OH ) . For expression purposes , a linker with the optimal Kozak - consensus and an NcoI site at the AUG initiation codon was inserted into pBluescript ( Stratagene ) . A 1 , 200 - bp NcoI fragment with the 5 ' - part of human eDNA ( starting at the AUG - start codon ) was inserted into the NcoI site of the linker followed by selection of a clone with the proper orien - tation for expression . A 2 , 550 - bp BstXI - HindIH fragment with the Y - part of the cDNA was added to make the cDNA full - length . The Vaccinia ex - pression construct , pTM1 ( kindly provided by Dr . B . Moss ) , was modified to remove the existing AUG . Full - length human dynamin cDNA with the synthetic Kozak - consensus was re . cloned into the modified pTMl - vector using flanking SpeI and SalI sites . This is the " wild type " construct , called pTM1 - Hwt . Mutations were introduced as follows : a complementary pair of oligonucleotides in which the desired mutation had been incorporated was used in two different PCRs with Pfu polymerase ( Stratagene ) . Either of the two mutagenic oligos was combined with an appropriate up - stream or downstream primer yielding two PCR products that were then fused by PCR in a second step with the upstream and downstream primers , but without the mutagenic primers . Products of the fusogenic PCR reactions were cleaved with SacII to yield 1 , 350 bp fragments , which were then recloned into SacII - cut and dephosphorylated pTMl - wild - type construct . The recloned constructs were sequenced to identify mutants and to ensure that they contained only the intended mutations . Supercoiled plasmid DNA , necessary for transient expression , was isolated with alkaline lysis followed by CsCl - gradient purification ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) . The cDNA that was 1 . Abbreviations used in thispaper : endo H , endoglycosidase H ; Tfn , trans - ferrin ; VSV - G , Vesicular Stomatitis virus G . chosen for the pTM1 - Hwt construct corresponds to the most prevalent COOH - terminal splice variant , i . e . , without an insert ( see Fig . 1 ) . The in - ternal splice variants were represented equally among the cDNAs ; pTM1 - Hwt has the second of the two in Fig . 1 . To confirm that the variants were products of alternative splicing , cross - hybridizing phage was isolated from a library of human lymphocyte ganomic DNA inserted in lambda DASH ( Stratagene ) . G - enomic EcoRI fragments were then subcloned into pBlue - script and the splice sites were sequenced using oligonncleotides generated while sequencing the cDNAs . RNA expression was analyzed by hybridizing a human multiple tissue Northern blot ( Clontech laboratories , Palo Alto , CA ) with a radiolabeled 1 , 400 - bp fragment of human dynamin eDNA cor - responding to the 5 " half of the mRNA . The blot was washed with a final wash at high stringency ( 0 . 2 Ã SSPE at 65 " C ) . The blot contained 2 ~ g poly ( A ) + RNA per lane with size markers of 9 . 5 , 7 . 5 , 4 . 4 , 2 . 4 , and 1 . 35 kb . Transfection Procedure HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and 100 U / ml each of penicillin and strep - tomycin in a 5 % humidified COz incubator . HeLa cells ( 1 . 5 Ã 106 ) were plated in 60 - mm dishes containing a coverslip the day before transfection . On occasion , cells were used 2 . 5 h after plating 1 . 5 Ã 106 eells / 60 - mm dish . Before infection , the cells were washed twice with DMEM , and then infected with vaecinia T7 RNA polymerase recombinant virus ( vTFT - 3 , Fuerst et al . , 1986 ) , at a multiplicity of 10 PFU / cell for 30 rain with inter - mittent rocking in a 37 " C incubator . The inoculum was removed and the cells transfected with 7 # g pTM1 plasmid DNA containing dynamin con - structs prepared as described above that had been previously mixed for 15 min at room temperature in 1 ml of DMEM and 20 # 1 of transfection reagent ( TransfectACE ) prepared as described ( Rose et al . , 1991 ) . 2 h after infec - tion , rifampicin ( 100 # g / ml final concentration ) was added to the cells and expression was allowed to proceed for the indicated times . Anti - Dynamin Antibodies and Western Analysis E . coli carrying the expression vector pETI ID containing a Drosophila dy - namin fragment ( residues 359 - 615 ) produced an abundant 30 - kD protein upon induction by IPTG . The protein was gel - purified , electroeluted , and used as antigen to generate polyclonal antibodies ( 748 ) from rabbits by stan - dard procedures . Serum from this rabbit contained an antibody immuno - reactive against the 30 - kD protein and a 100 - kD protein in HeLa cells and bovine brain extracts ( data not shown ) . The antibody also recognized recombinant wild - type and mutant molecules . For Western blot analysis , samples from the resuspended cells used in transport assays were lysed by the addition of 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , containing 5 m _ M MgCI2 and 1 mM AEBSF ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) . The samples were pelleted to clear the nuclei , precipitated with 10 % " IV _ A , washed with ice cold acetone , resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer , and then analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose , blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk powder in TBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 incubated with a 1 : 1 , 500 dilution of the rabbit anti - dynamin antibody ( 748 ) followed by detection with an HRP - conjngated secondary antibody ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , and then developed with ECL detection system ( Amersham Corp . , Arlington Heights , IL ) according to the manufacturer ' s directions . Signals from vari - ous exposure times were quantitated using a scanning densitometer ( Model GS300 , Hoefer Sci . Instrs . , San Francisco , CA ) connected to an IBM - XT with the integrating software ( Model GS350 , Hoefer Sei . Instrs . ) . Linearity was established using bovine brain cytosolie fractions to generate a standard curve . SubceUular Fractionation Cells from one 60 - mm dish were harvested at room temperature in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA and washed at 4 " C by centrifugation , and resuspended in 0 . 5 ml 0 . 25 M sucrose , 1 mM MgCt ~ , 2 mM EGTA , 25 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 . Cells were then lysed by rapid freezing in liquid nitro - gen , followed by slow thawing in a room temperature water bath . Soluble and particulate fractions were obtained after centrifugation for 30 min at 50 K rpm ( 110 k g ) in a TLAI00 . 2 ( Beckman Instrs . Inc . , Fullerton , CA ) rotor . Pellets were resuspended in 0 . 5 ml and equal amounts of pellet and supernatant fractions were solubilized in 0 . 5 % TX - 100 and precipitated with 10 % ' IV _ A . SDS - PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed as described above . Assay of Tfn Endocytosis After the appropriate period of protein expression ( usually 5 h ) , the cells The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 554 were washed I x in dPBS , harvested at room temperature in dPBS contain - ing 5 mM EDTA , pelleted in a Beckman J6 - B centrifuge at 1 , 000 rpm , and resuspended in dPBS containing 1 mM CaCI2 , 1 mM MgCI2 , 5 mM glu - cose , and 0 . 2 % BSA . For endocytosis assays , aliquots of cells were in - cubated at 37Â°C for the indicated times in the presence of BSST ( 2 / zg / ml final concentration ) . The cells were then returned to ice , pelleted , and the supernatant aspirated . Latency to MesNa and avidin was determined as pre - viously described ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ; Carter et al . , 1993 ) . Internalized Tfn was expressed as the percent of total surface - bound " lYn . The level of Tfn internalization was normalized to the amount of internalization for mock - infected cells to account for day to day variation ; however , the rate and extent of internalization after 5 h of vaccinia infection in the presence of rifampicin was typically between 60 - 90 % of that observed for control cells which had not been infected . Assay of ER - to - Golgi Transport HeLa ceils were infected and transfected as described above using 5 / ~ g of dynamin containing plasmid and 5 / ~ g of a plasmid encoding Vesicular Sto - matitis virus G ( VSV - G ) protein ( pAR - G , Tisdale et al . , 1992 ) . After the transfection period , the cells were pulse - labeled for 10 min in methionine - free media containing 20 / ~ Ci TRANS 35S - label , and then chased for 1 h in DMEM / 10 % FCS . The chase was terminated by the addition of lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCI , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM PMSF ) and VSV - G protein was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody to VSV - G ( clone 8 ( 35 ) . Immune precipitates were washed , boiled , and eluted VSV - G protein was digested with endoglycosidase H ( endo H ) ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and fluorography ( Tisdale , 1992 ) . Indirect lmmunofluorescence Coverslips containing transfected cells were incubated with 4 t ~ g / ml anti - Tfn receptor monoclonal antibody ( D65 ) for 30 min at 37Â°C in dPBS + + ( with 1 mM CaCI2 , 1 mM MgCI2 ) containing 5 mM glucose and 0 . 2 % BSA . Ex - cess antibody was removed by washing at 40C and the cells were incubated with 50 ttg / ml avidin in dPBS / BSA . Excess avidin was removed by washing and the cells were fixed for 20 rain at room temperature with 2 . 5 % formal - dehyde . Internalized biotinylated - HTR - D65 was detected by permeabilizing the fixed cells with 0 . 05 % saponin and probing with Texas red - conjugated ultraavidin ( Leinco Technologies , 2 ttg / rnl ) in permeabilization buffer ( PBS + + / 0 . 05 % saponin and 4 % goat serum ) . The ceils were then washed extensively and mounted in Aqua - Polymount ( Folysciences , Warrington , PA ) and viewed under a BioRad confocal scanning microscope . For indirect immunofluorescence of coat proteins , cells were fixed for 30 rain in 2 . 5 % formaldehyde , permeabilized as described above , and in - cubated with primary antibody ( 5 # g / ml AP . 6 , 20 # g / ml X22 ) in perrneabili - zation buffer for 30 - 60 rain at room temperature . Primary antibodies were visualized with Texas red goat anti - mouse IgG secondary reagents ( Molec - ular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . Results Molecular Analysis of Human Dynamin Human dynamin cDNA was cloned for use in the functional studies in HeLa cells described below , to avoid problems that might have arisen with a heterologous expression system . A human brain cDNA library was probed with radiolabeled Drosophila shibire cDNA , followed by reprobing with the human fragments that were initially obtained . A cDNA spanning the entire coding region of the human shibire homologue was constructed from two overlapping frag - ments , and then sequenced . The deduced protein is 864 amino acids of which 99 % are identical to rat dynamin ( Fig . 1 ) . Both human and rat sequences are similar to the Dro - sophila shibire sequence ( 69 % ) and this similarity extends throughout the molecule , strongly suggesting that function is conserved . Similar to rat and Drosophila , human dynamin has an NH2 - terminal GTPase domain that is highly con - served in VPSlp , MX - proteins , and MGMlp . The remainder of the molecule is divergent compared to these other family members and includes a proline / arginine - rich COOH - ter - minal domain specific to the dynamin homologues . Analysis of a large collection of cDNAs revealed alterna - tive splicing at two positions in the coding region ( shown in Fig . 1 ) . This has not been reported for rat dynamin , but is comparable to the alternative splicing found in Drosophila ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ; Chen et al . , 1991 ) . Each human variant cDNA was found in multiple copies and the points of divergence correspond to exon - intron bound - aries that include splice - site consensus sequences in the cor - responding genomic DNA ( data not shown ) . Thus it is un - likely that these represent cloning artifacts or incomplete processing . The first variation is the replacement of a 139 - nt exon in the middle domain by an alternative exon of equal length . These two exons were equally represented in the cloned cDNA collection . Both exons encode 47 - amino acid segments which differ by 15 amino acids ( Fig . 1 ) . The second splice variation occurs at a position close to the COOH - terminus and involves the insertion of mini - exons .

Dynamin Functions in Endocytosis 555 of expression in the brain may reflect a high demand for membrane retrieval at the synapse . Dynamin expression in all tissues , at various levels , is consistent with the pleiotropic phenotype found in Drosophila mutants ( Poodry et al . , 1973 ) . Figure 2 . RNA blot analysis of human dynamin expression . An RNA blot containing poly ( A ) + RNA from human heart , brain , placenta , lung liver , skeletal muscle , kidney , and pancreas was hy - bridized with radiolabeled cDNA corresponding to the 5 ' - half of the dynamin sequence . The size of the dynamin RNAs was deter - mined with an RNA ladder . A comparison between the high level of expression in brain and lower levels in other tissues was made using different exposure time ( 30 min vs 14 h ) . spliced at this position , although it is through replacement of alternative Y - exons rather than through the insertion of mini - exons ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ) . In a col - lection of 16 human cDNAs we found four variations at this position : ( 1 ) without a mini - exon ( in 10 cDNAs ) , ( 2 ) with a 4 - bp insertion which results in a frameshift and thus a differ - ent COOH - terminus ( in 4 cDNAs ) , ( 3 ) a 37 - bp insertion which contains a stop codon ( in 1 eDNA ) , and ( 4 ) the same insertion encoding an identical COOH - terminus but with ad - ditional noncoding sequence ( in 1 eDNA ) . The 37 - bp inser - tion is present in the published sequence of rat dynamin ( Obar et al . , 1990 ) . It seems likely that the other splice vari - ants will also be found in rat . The 3 ' - untranslated sequence is common to all cDNAs . The eDNA that we have used for the experiments described below was the most abundant in the collection . It has the second of the two internal variants shown in Fig . 1 and lacks the COOH - terminal mini - exon . Human dynamin is expressed in all tissues that were exam - ined by RNA blot analysis ( Fig . 2 ) . The RNA levels are simi - lar in most tissues , except in the human brain where it is at least 30 - fold higher . High levels of dynamin expression were also found in rat brain ( Seaife and Margolis , 1990 ; Nakata et al . , 1991 ) and in the Drosophila nervous system ( Chen et al . , 1992 ; Ding , D . , and A . M . v . d . Bliek , unpublished results ) . Human dynamin RNAs are 4 , 200 nt , except in the brain which has a 3 , 900 - nt and a 4 , 600 - nt transcript . These differences in length are not accounted for by the known pat - terns of alternative splicing and possibly reflect the use of al - ternative transcriptional initiation sites . The elevated levels Transient Expression of Dynamin in HeLa Cells To determine if dynamin is required for receptor - mediated endocytosis in HeLa cells , we expressed wild - type and mu - tant human dynamin constructs using a transient expression system ( Fuerst et al . , 1986 , 1989 ) . The generation and func - tional analysis of trans - dominant mutations in several GTP - ase family members has established the validity of this ap - proach ( Der et al . , 1988 ; Bucci et al . , 1992 ; van der Sluijs et al . , 1992 ; Tisdale et al . , 1992 ) . Site - directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce two mutations which signifi - candy reduce nucleotide - binding affinities in all members of the GTPase superfamily so far studied ( Fig . 3 a and refer - ences therein ) . The two mutations are designated element I ( K44 - - ' A ) and element HI ( K2Â° ~ - , D ) and involve replacing critical lysine residues required for nucleofide binding . Iden - tical results were obtained with both mutants ( data not shown ) and so studies presented here focus on the element I muta - tion . This nucleotide - binding element is also conserved in ATPases ( Walker et al . , 1982 ; Fry et al . , 1986 ) . While GTP binding has not been directly measured for the transiently expressed wild - type and mutant dynamin molecules , the conserved lysine residue directly interacts with the bound nucleotide and its mutagenesis reduces both ATP ( Meluh and Rose , 1990 ) and GTP ( Bourne et al . , 1990 , 1991 ) binding . For expression studies , HeLa cells were first infected with vaccinia T7 RNA polymerase recombinant virus ( vTF7 - 3 , Fuerst et al . , 1986 ) , and then transfected with the expression vector pTM1 containing a eDNA fragment encoding wild - type or mutant dynamin . Rifampicin was added to the cul - ture medium to block maturation of the vaccinia capsid and to reduce vaccinia - associated cytotoxic events ( Moss et al . , 1969 ) . Transfection efficiencies ranged from 25 to 60 % . Since an antibody capable of recognizing dynamin by im - munofluorescence was not available , transfection efficiencies were assessed by immunofluorescence of cells transfected with VSV - G protein in parallel ( data not shown , see Tisdale et al . , 1992 ) . Expression of mutant and wild - type dynamin was moni - tored by Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal anti - body ( 748 ) , which is monospecific for dynamin . A 100 - kD protein , corresponding to dynamin , was de - tected in nontransfected HeLa cells and was substantially in - creased in cells transfected with either the wild - type or the mutant dynamin constructs ( Fig . 3 b ) . This band was not de - tected by preimmune serum ( data not shown ) . Detection of a minor band at (cid:127)45 kD was variable and levels of this pro - tein were unaffected by infection or transfection . Dynamin expression was observed 3 h after transfection and continued to accumulate over 12 h . By 5 h after transfection , both wild - type and mutant dynamin accumulated in the cell popula - tion to 3 . 5 - 14 - fold higher than endogenous levels ( average ~ 7 . 5 - fold ) . Subcellular fracfionation of HeLa cells in isotonic sucrose indicated that dynamin was approximately equally distrib - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 556 uted between the particulate and the soluble fraction ( Fig . 3 c , lanes a ) as determined by densitometric analysis ( see Materials and Methods ) . This distribution was similar to that reported for brain tissue and PC12 cells ( Scaife and Mar - golis , 1990 ) . Tubulin served as a control for the almost quan - titative release of soluble proteins . The distribution of dyna - min was unaltered in virally infected and mock - transfected cells ( Fig . 3 c , lanes b ) . At high levels of expression ( (cid:127)13 - fold over endogenous ) , the amount of sedimentable wild - type dynamin increased ~ 4 - fold ( Fig . 3 c , lanes c ) , while most of the excess dynamin was present in the soluble pool . Similar results were obtained with mutant dynamin except that the amount of sedimentable dynamin was approximately eightfold over endogenous ( Fig . 3 c , lanes d ) . Lysis under higher salt conditions results in complete redistribution of dynamin into the soluble pool ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that dynamin interacts peripherally with a saturable component on membranes and that this interaction might be modulated by GTP binding . Expression of Mutant Dynamin Inhibits Receptor - mediated Endocytosis of Transferrin To follow receptor - mediated endocytosis in transfected HeLa cells , Tfn was biotinylated via a cleavable disulphide bond ( the complex is referred to as BSST ) for use as a ligand . Internalization was measured by following the latency of transferrin to the low molecular weight reducing agent , MesNa ( / ~ - mercaptoethane sulfonic acid ) as previously de - scribed ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ; Carter et al . , 1993 ) . The ex - periment presented in Fig . 4 demonstrates that both the rate and extent of endocytosis of transferrin were inhibited by > 40 % in cells overexpressing mutant dynamin as compared to mock - transfected cells ( i . e . , vaccinia - infected cells treated with TransfectAce ) . HeLa cells overexpressing wild - type dy - namin showed neither inhibition nor stimulation of endocy - tosis over mock - infected cells , indicating that the level of dy - namin expression was not rate - limiting . In general , mock transfection or transfection with wild - type dynamin resulted Figure 3 . Transient expression of wild - type and mutant dynamin constructs in HeLa cells .

Dynamin Functions in Endocytosis 557 100 " / D 80 i Â° 20 ' 0 I I I 0 5 10 15 Time ( min ) Figure 4 . Inhibition ofTfn endocytosis caused by expression of mu - tant dynamin . HeLa cells were harvested after 5 h of protein ex - pression and assayed for Tfn internalization as described in Ma - terials and Methods . ( D ) untreated cells ; ( o ) mock - transfected cells ; ( o ) cells transfected with wild - type dynamin ; and ( A ) cells transfected with mutant dynamin . In this experiment , the level of overexpression of transfected dynamin was six - fold over endog - enous . in partial reduction of endocytosis as compared to untreated cells . While significant inhibition of receptor - mediated en - docytosis was always observed in cells overexpressing mu - tant dynamin molecules , the extent of inhibition varied . In all experiments ( n = 12 ) , the extent of inhibition as com - pared to cells expressing equivalent levels of wild - type dyna - min was 38 + 13 % ( range 19 - 59 % ) . A correlation between the extent of inhibition of receptor - mediated endocytosis and the levels of expression of mutant dynamin molecules in the transfected population is shown in Fig . 5 . Overexpression from the transfected dynamin con - structs could be detected at 3 h after transfection and dyna - min continued to accumulate in the transfected cell popula - tion over the 5 - h time course shown ( Fig . 5 B ) . At the indicated times , cells expressing either wild - type or mutant dynamin were harvested and incubated for 15 min with BSST . As can be seen in Fig . 5 A ( solid bars ) , the inhibition of Tfn internalization relative to mock - transfected controls increased with increasing levels of expression of mutant dy - namin . The degree of inhibition of receptor - mediated en - docytosis in cells overexpressing mutant dynamin was 31 , 59 , and 65 % at 3 , 4 , and 5 h after transfection , respectively . At 5 h after transfection , cells expressing wt dynamin ex - hibited partially reduced endocytosis , possibly due to pro - longed viral infection . Inhibition due to expression of mutant dynamin is therefore measured relative to cells expressing wt dynamin . These results demonstrate that expression of mu - tant dynamin greatly reduces receptor - mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells . lmmunofluorescence Assay Reveals a Subpopulation of Cells with Severely Inhibited Endocytosis The most likely explanation for the partial block in endocy - 60 2O 0 3 ( I ) _ . 2 & 4 5 3 4 5 Time Post - transfection ( h ) Figure 5 . Time course of dynamin expression and inhibition of en - docytosis . Vaccinia - virus infected HeLa cells were transfected with either wild - type dynamin ( striped bars ) or ele I GTP - binding do - main mutant dynamin ( solid bars ) , and incubated for the indicated times before harvesting . ( A ) Inhibition ofTfn endocytosis expressed relative to the level of endocytosis in mock - transfected cells at 3 h was determined as described in Materials and Methods . ( B ) Dyna - min expression relative to endogenous levels was determined by Western blotting analysis as described in Materials and Methods . tosis in the cell population , given that transfection efficien - cies are 25 - 60 % , is cell - to - cell variability in the levels of dy - namin expression . For this reason , an immunofluorescence assay was developed to demonstrate that receptor - mediated endocytosis is strongly inhibited in a subpopulation of cells . In this single cell assay , transfected HeLa cells expressing mutant and wild - type dynamin were incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C with a biotinylated - monoclonal antibody ( HTR - D65 ) which recognizes the ectodomain of the Tfn receptor ( White et al . , 1990 ) . Unlike BSST , this antibody ligand will not be recycled and will accumulate in cells capable of efficient en - docytosis ( Weissman et al . , 1986 ) . Subsequently , the cells were washed and incubated for 30 min at 4Â°C with avidin to mask accessible biotin residues . The cells were washed , fixed , permeabilized , and incubated with Texas - red - con - jugated - avidin to detect the internalized , biotinylated - anti - TfR antibody . These results illustrated in Fig . 6 , demonstrate that mock - transfected cells ( Fig . 6 ; A ) or transfected cells overexpressing wild - type dynamin ( Fig . 6 ; B ) showed effi - cient and uniform internalization of receptor - bound anti - body . In marked contrast , a subpopulation of transfected cells expressing the mutant dynamin failed to internalize any detectable anti - TfR rnAbs ( Fig . 6 , C and D , arrowheads ) . The extent of inhibition determined biochemically corres - ponded to the fraction of cells unable to internalize HTR - D65 as detected by immunofluorescence . For example , in two experiments in which endocytosis was inhibited in cells expressing mutant dynamin by 29 and 37 % as compared to cells expressing wild - type dynamin , 23 and 32 % of ' ~ 400 cells counted for each condition showed inhibited endocyto - sis by immunofluorescence . Taken together , these assays provide strong evidence that functional dynamin is required for endocytosis of the Tfn receptor . Mutant Dynamin Blocks an Intermediate Stage in Coated Vesicle Formation We have previously shown that early and late stages in coated vesicle formation can be distinguished by determining the in - accessibility of bound ligand either to bulky probes such as The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 558 Figure 6 . Complete inhibition of Tfn - receptor internaliza - tion in a subpopulation of cells expressing mutant dynamin . Cells grown , infected , and transfected on coverslips as described in Materials and Methods were allowed to in - ternalize surface bound bi - otinylated anti - Tfn - R anti - body , HTR - D65 , for 30 min at 37 " C . Residual surfaeebound biotinylated antibody was masked with avidin , cells were fixed , permeabilized , and internalized HTR - D65 was subsequently detected with a Texas - red - conjugated ultra - avidin as described in Materials and Methods . Mock - transfected cells ( A ) and cells expressing wild - type dynamin ( B ) showed uni - formly high levels of intracel - lular HTR - D65 . In contrast , a subpopulation of ceils trans - fected with ele I GTP - binding domain mutant dynamin ( C and D ) were incapable of in - ternalizing detectable HTR - D65 ( open arrowheads ) . The level of inhibition determined biochemically in this experi - ment was 38 % over wild - type . avidin or antibodies , or to small probes such as MesNa . In - ternalization of biotinylated ligands into coated vesicles renders them inaccessible to both large and small probes ; however , ligands sequestered into deeply invaginated coated pits become inaccessible to avidin while remaining acces - sible to MesNa ( Schmid and Carter , 1990 ; Schmid and Smythe , 1991 ) . Under normal conditions , the rate and extent of endocytosis as measured using the two probes is identical . However , in cells depleted of ATE membrane fission is selectively blocked resulting in fivefold greater sequestration from avidin as compared to MesNa ( Schmid and Carter , 1990 ) . These two probes were used to determine the stage at which coated vesicle formation was blocked in cells ex - pressing mutant dynamin . The results , illustrated in Fig . 7 , demonstrate that the sequestration of Tfn into deeply invagi - nated coated pits was as effectively inhibited as Tfn internali - zation in HeLa cells expressing mutant dynamin . These ex - periments suggest that dynamin activity is required for a relatively early stage of endocytosis , preceding both coated pit invagination and the membrane fission event leading to coated vesicle formation . The effect of overexpression of dynamin mutants on coat assembly , an earlier stage of endocytosis , was examined by indirect immunofluorescence of the AP2 complex , a major plasma membrane coat protein . The results are shown in Fig . 8 . The punctate staining pattern characteristic of cell sur - face - coated pits was uniformly observed in untreated cells ( Fig . 8 ; A ) and was unaltered in transfected cells expressing 120 - 100 ' 80 ' 60 ' 40 ' 20 0 0 O I I I 5 10 15 Time ( rain ) Figure 7 . Expression of mutant dynamin blocks Tfn internalization at an intermediate stage in coated vesicle formation . Ceils express - ing either ( o , e ) wild - type dynamin or de I GTP - binding domain mutant dynamin ( zx , A ) were harvested after an 8 - h expression and incubated with BSST for the indicated times . The extent of Tfn in - ternalization was assessed either by MesNa - resistance ( e , A ) or avidin accessibility ( o , zx ) as described in Materials and Methods . van der Bliek et al . Dynamin Functions in Endocytosis 559 either wild - type ( Fig . 8 , B ) or mutant dynamin ( Fig . 8 , C ) . This distribution was uniformly observed throughout the population even though endocytosis of Tfn in these cells was 40 % inhibited . The distribution of clathrin , as detected by indirect immunofluorescence was similarly unaffected ( data not shown ) . These results are consistent with the accumula - tion of coated pits seen by EM of Drosophila shibire mutants ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ) and suggest that the initiation of coat assembly is unaltered by mutant dynamin . Mutant Dynamin Does Not Inhibit Transport from ER to the Golgi Complex Proteins involved in vesicular transport could be specific to a single step or could participate in multiple membrane trafficking events ( Rothman and Orci , 1992 ) . To determine whether mutant dynamin had a specific effect on the endo - cytic pathway , we investigated the consequence of its overex - pression on the secretory pathway . Transport along the early part of the secretory pathway was monitored by cotransfect - ing vaccinia - infected HeLa cells with T7 - expression con - structs encoding VSV - G and constructs encoding wild - type or mutant dynamin . VSV - G which serves as a marker for transport , acquires two endoglycosidase H ( endoH ) - sensitive N - linked oligosaccharide chains in the ER that are processed to endoH - resistant forms upon transport to the cis / medial Golgi compartments . The results presented in Fig . 9 demon - strate that pulse - labeled VSV - G was quantitatively ( > 90 % ) converted to the endoH resistant form after a 60 - min chase . The extent of transport to the Golgi was unaffected in cells cotransfected with either wild - type or mutant dynamin con - structs . In parallel experiments , endocytosis was inhibited by 30 - - 40 % ( data not shown ) . Preliminary immunofluorescence showed an unaltered distribution of VSV - G protein in cells expressing mutant and wild - type dynamin suggesting that export from the Golgi and delivery to the cell surface was also unaffected ( data not shown ) . More thorough examina - tion of the effects of dynamin on post - Golgi trafficking to the cell surface or to lysosomes awaits the generation of sta - ble transformants . These results rule out the possibility of nonspecific cytotoxic effects and indicate that mutant dyna - min expression causes a specific reduction in the early stages of receptor - mediated endocytosis . Discussion Dynamin Is Required for Receptor - mediated Endocytosis We have shown that receptor - mediated endocytosis is in - hibited in mammalian cells that overexpress mutant dyna - min . Using assays which enable detection of intermediates in coated vesicle formation , the dynamin mutants were found to block endocytosis at a stage preceding the seques - tration of ligands into deeply invaginated coated pits . The distribution of clathrin and APs , the major coat constituents , was unaffected in cells overexpressing these dynamin mu - tants , suggesting that the block follows coat assembly . These results demonstrate that mutations in the GTP - binding do - main of dynamin block Tfn - endocytosis in mammalian cells , suggesting that a functional dynamin GTPase is required for receptor - mediated endocytosis via clathrin - coated pits . Figure 8 . The distribution of c ~ - adaptins is unaffected by overex - pression of mutant dynamin . The distribution of ct - adaptins was de - termined by indirect immunofluorescenee using the AP . 6 mAb as described in Materials and Methods . ( A ) mock - transfected cells ; ( B ) ceils expressing wild - type dynamin ; ( C ) cells expressing mu - tant dynamin . The level of inhibition determined bioehemically in this experiment was 40 % over wild - type . The mutations constructed in elements I and III of the dy - namin GTP - binding domain were predicted , by analogy to ms ( Sigal et al . , 1986 ; Der et al . , 1988 ) , SRP - R ot - subunit ( Rapiejko and Gilmore , 1992 ) , and SRP54 ( Bernstein , H . , and P . Walter , personal communication ) to reduce its affinity for both GTP and GDP . Here we report that point mutations in dynamin predicted to reduce GTP - binding have a domi - nant negative effect on endocytosis when overexpressed in mammalian cells . Interestingly , a number of mutations in the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 560 Figure 9 . Dynamin mutants do not inhibit VSV - G transport between the ER and the Golgi stack . Vaccinia - infected cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the indicated dynamin construct and a plasmid encoding VSV - G protein ( pAR - ts ) . Conversion of pulse - labeled VSV - G protein from an EndoH sensitive form found in the ER to an EndoH resistant form associated with the Golgi complex was determined as described in Materials and Methods . GTP - binding domain of VPSlp , a dynamin - related protein in yeast , including some which do not affect GTP - binding , have dominant negative effects on vacuolar sorting ( Vater et al . , 1992 ) . This result supports the importance of the GTPase domain for dynamin function . In contrast to the stimulatory effect of overexpression of the small GTP - binding proteins rab5 ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ) and rab4 ( van der Sluijs et al . , 1992 ) on endocytosis in mammalian cells , overexpression of wild - type dynamin had no detectable effect . This result sug - gests that the level of dynamin is not normally " rate - limiting " for endocytosis in mammalian cells . Dynamin was originally identified as a microtubule - stimulated GTPase ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 , 1992 ; Maeda et al . , 1992 ) , however the significance of this associa - tion is unclear ( Vallee , 1992 ) . Drugs which influence the po - lymerization or depolymerization of microtubules do not al - ter the rate or extent of receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Oka and Weigel , 1983 ; Morgan and Iacopetta , 1987 ) . Our find - ing that dynamin is required for receptor - mediated endo - cytosis in mammalian cells is therefore inconsistent with its previously suggested role as a microtubule - based mech - anochemical motor ( Shpetner and Vailee , 1989 ) . Recent results have shown that while highly purified preparations of dynamin retain their microtubule - stimulated GTPase activ - ity , they lack microtubule - based motor activity ( Maeda et al . , 1992 ) . Given our results , it remains likely that other , as yet unidentified proteins or protein complexes regulate dyna - min GTPase activity in vivo . Overexpression of mutant dynamin appeared to spe - cifically inhibit receptor - mediated endocytosis : transport of VSV - G protein from the ER to the Golgi was unaffected and preliminary results suggested that delivery to the cell surface was also unaffected . Given the incomplete inhibition in these transient transfection assays , more thorough analysis of the effects of overexpression of these dynamin mutants on other vesicular trafficking pathways , including fluid - phase endocy - tosis , receptor - recycling , post - Golgi trafficking , and lyso - somal targeting will await the generation of inducible stably transformed cell lines . The Shibire Phenotype and the Role of Dynamin in Endocytosis Dynamin was first linked to endocytosis through the discov - ery that the Drosophila homologue of dynamin is encoded by the shibire gene ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ; Chen et al . , 1991 ) . Shibire was identified earlier as a muta - tion that causes temperature sensitive paralysis in adult flies ( Grigliatti et al . , 1973 ) and was shown to affect development if the temperature was shifted at a critical time ( Poodry et al . , 1973 ) . Evidence suggesting that shibire affects endocy - tosis has come largely through morphological studies which have shown that conditional paralysis correlates with a de - pletion of synaptic vesicles , and a concomitant increase in coated pits at nerve endings ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ) . In other cell types , for example , nephrocytes ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ; Koenig and Ikeda , 1990 ) or oocytes ( Kessel et al . , 1989 ) , shift to the nonpermissive temperature also leads to the apparent disappearance of the endosomal compart - ment and an increase in cell surface area , reflected by the for - mation of large membrane infoldings . Coated pits , which ap - pear normal , are often seen at the bottom of these membrane invaginations . These electron microscopic observations , coupled to the rapid kinetics of paralysis and its reversal in shibire mutants ( < 1 min ) are compatible with a defect in the early stages of endoeytosis . For lack of a suitable receptor in Drosophila , functional studies have been limited to morphological studies after the uptake of electron dense fluid phase mark - ers . These studies support the hypothesis that the shibire mu - tation is defective in endocytosis ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ; Tsurahura et al . , 1990 ) . By testing the effect of mutant dyna - min on transferrin uptake in HeLa cells , we have provided the first functional evidence that the mutant protein blocks receptor - mediated endocytosis at an intermediate stage in coated vesicle formation . Human Dynamin Expression and Alternative Splicing The human cDNA is the third dynamin homologue to be cloned . What distinguishes dynamin from related proteins ( for review see Collins , 1991 ) is a proline rich ( 30 % ) and highly basic COOH - terminus that extends , ~ 100 amino acids . This domain is similar in composition to the COOH - terminal domain of synapsin I , which has been implicated in the binding of synapsin I to a synaptic vesicle protein ( Ben - fenati et al . , 1992 ) . The extreme COOH - termini of both dy - namin and synapsin I are alternatively spliced ( Sudhof et al . , 1989 ) . Whether this reflects a common function in mem - brane binding remains to be tested . Multiple electrophoreti - cally distinct isoforms of dynamin have been detected in both rat and Drosophila protein extracts ( Scaife and Margolis , 1990 ; Chen et al . , 1991 ; Faire et al . , 1992 ) . These may cor - respond to the splice variants detected in Drosophila ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ; Chen et al . , 1991 ) and in humans . Given that mutations in dynamin disrupt endocytosis , it is of no surprise that the gene is expressed in all tissues exam - ined thus far . However , it is striking that expression is at least 30 - fold higher in the human brain . The coat proteins clathrin and APs , by comparison , are expressed at 5 - 10 - fold higher levels in brain ( Kirschhausen et al . , 1987 ; Robinson , 1989 ) . Whole - mount in situs of Drosophila embryos show very high dynamin expression throughout the nervous system ( Chen et al . , 1992 ; Ding , D . , and A . M . v . d . Bliek , unpublished results ) . Dynamin is highly expressed in the rat cerebellar van der Bliek et al . Dynarain Functions in Endocytosis 561 cortex , the hippocampus , and the cerebral cortex ( Nakata et al . , 1991 ; Falre et al . , 1992 ) similar to the distribution of AP subunit transcripts ( Robinson , 1989 ) . Recent studies have demonstrated that coated vesicles isolated from synaptic ter - mini are almost exclusively involved in recycling the constit - uents of synaptic vesicles ( Maycox et al . , 1992 ) . Thus , high levels of dynamin expression in nerve cells are consistent with its role in expediting synaptic vesicle recycling . Conclusion What role might dynamin play in receptor - mediated endocy - tosis and coated vesicle formation ? Our results show that mutant dynamin blocks endocytosis after the initiation of coat assembly but before coated pit invagination . This specifically assigns a role for dynamin in the intermediate stages on the temporal sequence of events that can be dis - tinguished biochemically : coat assembly , receptor recruit - ment , coated pit invagination and vesicle budding ( Schmid , 1993 ) . Consistent with this assignment and with the known affinity of dynamin for GTP , coated pit invagination in vitro requires , x , 10 / zM GTP ( Carter et al . , 1993 ) . Members of the GTPase superfamily , in general , act as monitors and molec - ular switches which either trigger an event or ensure the fidelity of vectorial reactions ( Bourne et al . , 1990 , 1991 ) . During coated pit invagination dynamin might monitor receptor recruitment , necessary coat protein rearrange - ments , or the assembly of a molecular complex required for invagination or budding . In response to completion of these requisites to vesicle formation , dynamin might trigger in - vagination . While we cannot rule out that dynamin plays an active , mechanochemical role in the invagination and / or pinching process , this seems less likely given its membership in the GTPase superfamily . Our observation that dynamin is equally distributed in particulate and soluble fractions sug - gests cycling on and off the membrane as part of its function . Further characterization of the role of dynamin will follow from identification of interacting proteins .
