For example , a fast food chain operator opening a new restaurant needs to decide its location considering the demand in the area as well as the competition with other (cid:12)rms . Another example is a manufacturing company that considers the kind of products it should develop while taking into account the future demand . Several studies such as Bronnenberg and Mahajan ( 2001 ) , and Cleeren et al . ( 2010 ) show that product positions in(cid:13)uence the pricing decisions of retailing and marketing (cid:12)rms greatly . Due to the importance of product positioning , many theoretical studies investigate the factors determining the product positions of (cid:12)rms in various contexts by using the Hotelling ( 1929 ) type linear city models . These studies include d’Aspremont et al . ( 1979 ) , Friedman and Thisse ( 1993 ) , Tabuchi and Thisse ( 1995 ) , Tyagi ( 2000 , 2001 ) , Kim and Serfes ( 2006 ) , Matsushima ( 2009 ) , Sajeesh and Raju ( 2010 ) , Liu and Tyagi ( 2011 ) , and Lai and Tabuchi ( 2012 ) . 1 Although the existing studies oﬀer many interesting insights , they are derived using static or discrete - time models with consumers purchasing products at most several periods , implying robust results over the markets where the demand is quite stable for a long time . However , if we consider the consumers’ repeated purchases in growing or changing markets , entry timing is an important strategic decision for (cid:12)rms . In actual situations , the uncertainty of future demand for products aﬀects the decisions on location , product positioning , entry timing , and so on . Uncertainty is especially important for (cid:12)rms facing competition because the strategies of entry timing and product positioning with future uncertainty can have a bigger and mutual impact on the strategies of other (cid:12)rms than without . In summary , a (cid:12)rm needs to take uncertainty and competition into account 1 Several empirical studies also investigate the problems of positioning ( e . g . , Thomadsen , 2007 ; Hwang et al . , 2010 ) . 2 while deciding on product positioning and entry timing . 2 The decision - making of a (cid:12)rm under uncertainty as well as competition is often studied within a real options framework . McDonald and Siegel ( 1986 ) is the seminal paper in the literature , and there are many extensions and generalizations after the paper . For example , D(cid:19)ecamps and Mariotti ( 2004 ) consider a duopoly market in which the irreversible cost of each (cid:12)rm at the market entry is privately observed . Thijssen ( 2010 ) studies an investment problem under the assumption that the state variables of the two (cid:12)rms are player - speci(cid:12)c in that random terms are not perfectly correlated . Recently , Huisman and Kort ( 2015 ) studied the problem where two asymmetric (cid:12)rms choose not only their investment timing but also their production capacity at investment . Market size is a state variable and follows a geometric Brownian motion as in the real op - tions literature . 3 Huisman and Kort ( 2015 ) is novel in that two symmetric (cid:12)rms optimally choose two strategic variables . This approach can be applied to many monopoly / oligopoly problems . 4 They (cid:12)nd that the leader (cid:12)rm overinvests in capacity to deter the entry of the follower and that greater uncertainty makes entry deterrence more likely . From their article , uncertainty is of great importance for the decision - making of (cid:12)rms facing competition , and that the multiple dimension of decision - making may lead to diﬀerent results when compared to a single - dimension case . In addition , Ebina et al . ( 2015 ) extend Lambertini ( 2002 ) to study the entry timings of (cid:12)rms facing competition . They construct a continuous - time spatial competition model a la d’Aspremont et al . ( 1979 ) . In the model , two (cid:12)rms optimally determine their locations and prices as well as the follower’s entry timing , but the leader’s entry time is exogenously (cid:12)xed as in Lambertini ( 2002 ) . The main (cid:12)nding of the study is that the leader has an incentive to 2 In the context of spatial competition with sequential entry , Neven ( 1987 ) and Bonanno ( 1987 ) are the pioneering works , which have been extended in several directions ( e . g . , Loertscher and Muehlheusser , 2011 ) . 3 A good survey is presented by Chevalier - Roignant et al . ( 2011 ) 4 Lobel et al . ( 2016 ) studies a monopolist’s optimization problem on product launches within a real options framework . In addition , Nielsen ( 2002 ) , Weeds ( 2002 ) , Huisman and Kort ( 2003 ) , and Pawlina and Kort ( 2006 ) study monopoly or duopoly within real options frameworks , but with (cid:12)rms choosing only their timings in the models . Ziedonis ( 2007 ) provides a brief overview of the real option literature . 3 locate close to the center to delay the follower’s entry , leading to a non - optimal outcome from the viewpoint of social welfare . The study also sheds light on the importance of multiple dimensions for the (cid:12)rm’s decision - making . It is noteworthy that the demand for the product grows at a constant rate , indicating no uncertainty in their model . In this article , we investigate the entry decisions of (cid:12)rms that endogenously determine their product positions in a market whose size is evolving stochastically . To this end , we substantially extend Ebina et al . ( 2015 ) , which does not assume uncertainty on the growth path . Furthermore , we endogenize the leader’s entry timing ; this is also a signi(cid:12)cant extension of Ebina et al . ( 2015 ) . 5 We describe uncertainty as the product demand following a geometric Brownian motion , as in Pawlina and Kort ( 2006 ) and Huisman and Kort ( 2015 ) . By doing so , we can analyze the eﬀect of uncertainty on the two (cid:12)rms’ entry timings and location strategies in a Hotelling model . The major (cid:12)ndings of the study are as follows . First , the leader (cid:12)rm optimally chooses the center as its location in case of low volatility , and the edge in case of high volatility . In addition , in case of high volatility , the delay of the follower’s entry occurs in accordance with the maximum diﬀerentiation by the leader , contrasting with the standard intuition in which the leader prefers locating itself closer to the center by anticipating the delay of the follower’s entry . The reason for our counterintuitive result is that high volatility makes the leader (cid:12)rm give more importance to the future situation where two (cid:12)rms face price competition , leading to the leader’s strategy locating itself as far from the center as possible . Our paper is the (cid:12)rst study to construct a model in which demand evolves stochastically forever , and to examine the eﬀect of uncertainty on locations within a continuous - time setting where both (cid:12)rms dynamically optimize their objectives . 6 Second , the entry threshold of the follower (cid:12)rm is not monotonic in the volatility of the 5 Ebina and Matsushima ( 2017 ) provide another major extension to the work of Ebina et al . ( 2015 ) by incorporating exclusive vertical relations . However , the direction of this extension is quite diﬀerent from ours . 6 In static frameworks , several studies investigate how uncertainty aﬀects the optimal locations in the literature on industrial organization ( e . g . , Meagher and Zauner , 2004 ; Christou and Vettas , 2005 ) . 4 state variable . In the real options literature , the threshold is always an increasing function of volatility , irrespective of whether the (cid:12)rm is a leader or a follower if there is a negative externality . 7 To the authors’ best knowledge , this article is the (cid:12)rst to show that greater uncertainty can lead to early entry of the follower (cid:12)rm in some cases . This (cid:12)nding indicates the importance of multiple dimensions for decision - making . We also present some intuitive remarks on why non - monotonicity occurs . Third , the eﬀect of entry cost asymmetry between the two (cid:12)rms on the leader’s location diﬀers , depending on the type of equilibrium . More concretely , in a preemptive equilibrium , a higher entry cost asymmetry makes the leader locate itself closer to the edge , while it makes the leader’s location closer to the center in a sequential equilibrium . As we will see later , there are positive and negative eﬀects of the leader’s location on its pro(cid:12)ts , and the magnitude of the two eﬀects is dependent on the type of equilibrium that is realized . In summary , the analysis shows that multiple dimensions of strategies complicate the problem and may give diﬀerent results from those in single - dimension cases which are studied by many papers in the real options literature . The remaining part of the article is organized as follows . Section 2 sets up our model and formulates our problem . Section 3 derives the optimal timing and location of the follower (cid:12)rm . In Section 4 , we (cid:12)rst categorize the equilibrium type and then derive the optimal timing and location of the follower (cid:12)rm in a sequential equilibrium . We implement numerical calcu - lations to examine how the leader’s entry threshold and location are aﬀected by exogenous parameters in Section 5 . Finally , some concluding remarks are presented in Section 6 . 2 The Model In this section , we construct our model based on Ebina et al . ( 2015 ) and introduce uncertainty into it as in Pawlina and Kort ( 2006 ) . 7 Mason and Weeds ( 2010 ) show that the threshold of a leader is non - monotonic if there is a positive externality . However , under the assumption of a negative externality , the thresholds of the leader and the follower are increasing in the volatility . 5 Two (cid:12)rms , indexed by i 2 f 1 ; 2 g , produce homogeneous goods . Consumers are uniformly distributed over the unit segment [ 0 ; 1 ] , as proposed by Hotelling ( 1929 ) . 8 The density of consumer distribution at time t is Y t , which stochastically changes as explained later . Each consumer is indexed by x 2 [ 0 ; 1 ] and repeatedly purchases at each instance [ t ; t + d t ) at most one unit of the good . He chooses the (cid:12)rm to purchase from when he actually decides to purchase . 9 The consumption of a unit of the good entails a positive utility . On the other hand , the consumer at point x 2 [ 0 ; 1 ] incurs a quadratic transportation cost c ( x i (cid:0) x ) 2 and the price p it at time t 2 [ 0 ; 1 ) while buying a good from (cid:12)rm i located at x i 2 [ 0 ; 1 ] . 10 To summarize , the utility of the consumer at point x 2 [ 0 ; 1 ] and time t 2 [ 0 ; 1 ) is given by u t ( x ; x 1 ; x 2 ; p 1 t ; p 2 t ) = 8 > < > : (cid:22) u (cid:0) p 1 t (cid:0) c ( x 1 (cid:0) x ) 2 if purchased from (cid:12)rm 1 ; (cid:22) u (cid:0) p 2 t (cid:0) c ( x 2 (cid:0) x ) 2 if purchased from (cid:12)rm 2 ; 0 otherwise ; ( 1 ) where (cid:22) u denotes the gross surplus each consumer enjoys from purchasing the good and c > 0 is a parameter describing the level of transportation cost or product diﬀerentiation . 11 Alter - natively , we can regard c as the parameter representing the width of the market given the (cid:12)xed length of the Hotelling line segment . 12 The following assumption can make the equilibrium meaningful . Assumption 1 . (cid:22) u > 3 c . Assumption 1 guarantees that at least one of the two (cid:12)rms has an incentive to supply a positive amount of goods after maximizing its pro(cid:12)t wherever it is located . It also guarantees that a monopolist prefers serving all consumers regardless of its location . 8 This setting and the following assumptions are standard in the literature on spatial economics . 9 In equilibrium , all consumers purchase a unit of the product at all times , according to Assumption 1 presented below . 10 The problem in which both (cid:12)rms can locate themselves outside the interval [ 0 ; 1 ] is studied in a diﬀerent paper . 11 If c = 0 , the follower can earn no pro(cid:12)t after its entry , implying that our setting corresponds to a monopolistic situation because the follower never enters the market . To avoid this simple case , we assume c > 0 . 12 See the discussion in Section 5 . 6 Now , we introduce uncertainty into our market model . The density of consumer distribu - tion , or the market size Y t , is dynamically stochastic . We impose the following assumption on Y . Assumption 2 . The process Y follows a geometric Brownian motion as d Y t = (cid:11)Y t d t + (cid:27)Y t d W t ; where (cid:11) is the expected growth rate , (cid:27) is the market volatility , and f W t g t (cid:21) 0 is a standard Brownian motion . The initial value of the state process , Y 0 (cid:17) y 0 , is suﬃciently low . Assumption 2 states that the future pro(cid:12)t (cid:13)ow of each (cid:12)rm is uncertain and follows a geometric Brownian motion . 13 The assumption on the initial value y 0 is standard in the real options literature , and means that the market is too small and that neither (cid:12)rm has made an entry into the market at the initial time . The game in this article proceeds as follows . Firm i chooses the time of entry T i 2 [ 0 ; 1 ) and the location x i 2 [ 0 ; 1 ] simultaneously . The entry incurs an irreversible cost F i at T i . Existing (cid:12)rm ( s ) simultaneously choose the price p it at each time t , observing all available information such as the realization of Y and their location ( s ) x i . Although (cid:12)rm i can vary the price p it at any time , its location is (cid:12)xed forever after the determination of x i . We consider the Nash equilibrium in which (cid:12)rm i maximizes its present value of cash (cid:13)ows with respect to ( T i ; x i ; f p it g t (cid:21) T i ) given the other (cid:12)rm’s strategy . Here is a remark on our assumption . We assume that (cid:12)rms locate within the line segment [ 0 ; 1 ] , which contrasts with the assumption in several previous papers that (cid:12)rms are allowed to locate outside the line segment ( e . g . , Tyagi , 2000 ; Sajeesh and Raju , 2010 ; Liu and Tyagi , 2011 ) . If we follow the latter assumption , we will obtain an outcome in which the leader (cid:12)rm , say (cid:12)rm 1 , locates at x 1 = 1 = 2 irrespective of the exogenous parameters . We present the following assumptions for the entry cost F i . 13 Exponential market growth is seen to be valid in many industries ; for example , see Lages and Fernandes ( 2005 ) on telecommunication services , Victor and Ausubel ( 2002 ) on DRAM , and Vakratsas and Kolsarici ( 2008 ) on pharmaceuticals . 7 Assumption 3 . F 1 = F < (cid:20)F = F 2 , where (cid:20) > 1 . Assumption 3 states that (cid:12)rm 1 has an advantage in the entry cost over (cid:12)rm 2 . Since asymmetry occurs only in the entry cost , we speculate that (cid:12)rm 1 is always the leader for market entry in our model . Now , let us describe the present value of the (cid:12)rms at time t 2 [ 0 ; 1 ) given that (cid:12)rm j enters the market at point x j at time t = T j . Here , T ℓi denotes the entry time of (cid:12)rm i when it is the leader , and T fj denotes that of (cid:12)rm j when it is the follower . Superscripts ℓ and f represent the leader and the follower , respectively . As the model is time - homogeneous , the optimal entry time is expressed as the (cid:12)rst hitting time ; that is , T ℓi = T i ( y ℓi ) (cid:17) inf f t (cid:21) 0 ; Y t (cid:21) y ℓi g and T fj = T j ( y fj ) (cid:17) inf f t (cid:21) 0 ; Y t (cid:21) y fj g ; where y ℓi and y fj are the thresholds of the leader and the follower , respectively . Let (cid:22) x 2 [ 0 ; 1 ] be a point at which the consumer is indiﬀerent between purchasing from (cid:12)rm 1 and purchasing from 2 . We can easily verify from ( 1 ) that (cid:22) x = p 2 t (cid:0) p 1 t + c ( x 22 (cid:0) x 21 ) 2 c ( x 2 (cid:0) x 1 ) ; ( 2 ) which indicates that the optimal price of each (cid:12)rm depends on the locations of both (cid:12)rms ( x 1 ; x 2 ) . Therefore , the value function of (cid:12)rm j at time t when it is the follower is written with discount rate r as E y [ ∫ 1 T j ( y f j ) e (cid:0) r ( s (cid:0) t ) Y s ∫ 1 (cid:22) x p fjs d x d s (cid:0) e (cid:0) r ( T j ( y fj ) (cid:0) t ) F j ] ; ( 3 ) where E y denotes the expectation operator conditional on Y t = y . We assume that r > (cid:11) to ensure (cid:12)niteness of the value function . 14 On the other hand , the value function of (cid:12)rm i as the leader , denoted by V ℓi , is expressed as E y [ ∫ T j ( y fj ) T i ( y ℓi ) e (cid:0) r ( s (cid:0) t ) Y s ∫ 1 0 p ℓis d x d s + ∫ 1 T j ( y fj ) e (cid:0) r ( s (cid:0) t ) Y s ∫ (cid:22) x 0 p ℓis d x d s (cid:0) e (cid:0) r ( T i ( y ℓi ) (cid:0) t ) F i ] : ( 4 ) 14 If r (cid:20) (cid:11) , the integral of equation ( 3 ) diverges to positive in(cid:12)nity by choosing a larger time T 2 , meaning that waiting for a longer time would always be a better strategy , and an optimal entry timing would not exist . 8 The (cid:12)rst term in the right - hand side of ( 4 ) describes the discounted cash (cid:13)ow whereas (cid:12)rm i is the monopolist , and the second term is the discounted cash (cid:13)ow after the other (cid:12)rm’s entry . More concretely , if (cid:12)rm i is the leader , it earns a monopoly pro(cid:12)t (cid:13)ow for t 2 [ T i ; T j ) and a duopoly pro(cid:12)t (cid:13)ow for t (cid:21) T j . 3 Follower’s Value Functions In this section , we derive the optimal price , location , and timing outcomes of the follower (cid:12)rm . As in the literature , we implement backward induction for the derivation of the solutions . First , given the locations x 1 and x 2 , we consider the problem of optimal prices at each time t before and after the entry of (cid:12)rm 2 . From ( 2 ) , we can conclude that the uncertainty of Y does not aﬀect the equilibrium prices . Therefore , we obtain the following lemma , which describes the equilibrium prices of both (cid:12)rms . Lemma 1 . We assume the leader (cid:12)rm i ’s location x i is x i 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] without loss of generality . The prices set by the leader (cid:12)rm i and the follower (cid:12)rm j ( ̸ = i ) are respectively , ^ p ℓit = { p Mi ( x i ) = (cid:22) u (cid:0) c ( 1 (cid:0) x i ) 2 ; t 2 [ T i ; T j ) ; p Dℓi ( x i ; x j ) = c 3 ( x j (cid:0) x i ) ( 2 + x i + x j ) ; t 2 [ T j ; 1 ) ; ( 5 ) ^ p fjt = p Dfj ( x i ; x j ) = c 3 ( x j (cid:0) x i ) ( 4 (cid:0) x i (cid:0) x j ) ; t 2 [ T j ; 1 ) : ( 6 ) Proof . See the proof of Lemma 1 in Ebina et al . ( 2015 ) . Firm i has monopolistic power over the price at t 2 [ T i ; T j ) such that all consumers purchase its goods . Then , the optimal price of (cid:12)rm i before the entry of (cid:12)rm j is the price at which the consumer at location 1 is indiﬀerent between purchasing and not purchasing the good . The optimal monopolistic price p Mi in Lemma 1 satis(cid:12)es this condition . The optimal prices for the duopoly p Dℓi ( x i ; x j ) and p Dfj ( x i ; x j ) are based on the standard calculation in the context of spatial competition ( e . g . , d’Aspremont et al . , 1979 ) . 9 With the prices ^ p ℓit and ^ p fjt , the instantaneous pro(cid:12)t (cid:13)ows of the two (cid:12)rms are expressed as Y t (cid:25) ℓit and Y t (cid:25) fjt , respectively , where (cid:25) ℓit ( x i ; x j ) = { (cid:25) Mℓi ( x i ) = (cid:22) u (cid:0) c ( 1 (cid:0) x i ) 2 ; t 2 [ T i ; T j ) ; (cid:25) Dℓi ( x i ; x j ) = c 18 ( x j (cid:0) x i ) ( 2 + x i + x j ) 2 ; t 2 [ T j ; 1 ) ; ( 7 ) (cid:25) fjt ( x i ; x j ) = { 0 ; t 2 [ 0 ; T j ) ; (cid:25) Dfj ( x i ; x j ) = c 18 ( x j (cid:0) x i ) ( 4 (cid:0) x i (cid:0) x j ) 2 ; t 2 [ T j ; 1 ) ; ( 8 ) as (cid:22) x = ( 2 + x 1 + x 2 ) = 6 in equilibrium . 3 . 1 Optimal location and entry threshold First , we consider the problem of the follower relating to when it enters and where it locates in the market . We assume that (cid:12)rm i is the leader and has already invested and located at x i 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] . We write the value function of the follower as V f (cid:3) j ( y ; x i ) = max ( yfj ; xj ) y fj (cid:21) 0 ; x j 2 [ 0 ; 1 ] V fj ( y ; y fj ; x i ; x j ) ; where V fj ( y ; y fj ; x i ; x j ) = E y [ ∫ 1 T j ( y fj ) e (cid:0) r ( s (cid:0) t ) (cid:25) Dfj ( x i ; x j ) Y s d s (cid:0) e (cid:0) r ( T j ( y fj ) (cid:0) t ) F j ] : = ( (cid:25) Dfj ( x i ; x j ) y fj r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F j ) ( y y fj ) (cid:12) ( 9 ) and (cid:12) = 1 2 (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:27) 2 + √ ( 1 2 (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:27) 2 ) 2 + 2 r (cid:27) 2 : Note that the function V fj depends on the other (cid:12)rm’s location as the instantaneous pro(cid:12)t (cid:13)ow (cid:25) Dfj depends on x i . This implies that the pair of optimal strategies ( y fj ; x j ) also depends on x i . However , with regard to the location of the follower (cid:12)rm j , we have the following lemma . 10 Lemma 2 . In equilibrium , the follower (cid:12)rm j always locates at x fj = 1 . Proof . Since V fj is given by ( 9 ) , the optimal location of the follower maximizes its instanta - neous pro(cid:12)t (cid:25) Dfj in ( 8 ) given x i . The lemma immediately follows . Once the optimal location is obtained , the optimal timing can easily be derived as in the following lemma . We omit the proof because it is an easy exercise . Lemma 3 . The value function of (cid:12)rm j as the follower is given by V f (cid:3) j ( y ; x i ) = 8 > < > : ( (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) (cid:25) Dfj ( x i ; 1 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F j ) ( y (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ) (cid:12) ; if y < (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ; y(cid:25) Dfj ( x i ; 1 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F j ; if y (cid:21) (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ; where the investment threshold of the follower is (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) = (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) ) (cid:25) Dfj ( x i ; 1 ) F j : ( 10 ) From Lemma 2 , the follower (cid:12)rm always locates as far away from the location of the leader as possible while entering the market . This replicates the results of Lambertini ( 2002 ) and Ebina et al . ( 2015 ) and seems to be robust to the endogeneity of the follower’s entry timing under uncertainty . From ( 10 ) , we easily obtain the following corollary : Corollary 1 . If x 1 is increased , the optimal threshold for the follower to enter (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) is increased . The corollary shows that the leader can obstruct the follower’s entry by choosing its location close to 1 = 2 . On the other hand , setting x i close to 1 = 2 can induce a tougher price competition after the follower’s entry . The leader (cid:12)rm faces the trade - oﬀ between the two with regard to location . 11 4 Leader’s Strategy and Equilibria In this section , we derive the outcome of the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium ( SPNE ) . We face two diﬃculties while deriving the equilibria , when compared to the process used in Pawlina and Kort ( 2006 ) . The (cid:12)rst diﬃculty arises because the value functions of our model are determined by the (cid:12)rms’ entry timings as well as location choices , but in the previous study , these functions were determined by only their entry timings . Thus , the location choice in our model entails complexity , making it diﬃcult to derive an analytical solution . The second diﬃculty arises from the asymmetry of the (cid:12)rms’ pro(cid:12)ts . Since the (cid:12)rms’ location choices may not be symmetric on the Hotelling interval [ 0 ; 1 ] , the pro(cid:12)ts (cid:25) Dℓi ( x i ; 1 ) and (cid:25) Dfj ( x i ; 1 ) may have diﬀerent values , leading to a situation where an equilibrium becomes more complicated . To derive equilibrium , we need to consider the leader’s optimization problem given the follower’s strategy . Suppose that (cid:12)rm i is a leader and enters the market with location x i at T i ( y ℓi ) . Given the other (cid:12)rm’s strategy ( y j ; x j ) = ( (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ; 1 ) , the present value of the leader (cid:12)rm i is written as ^ V ℓi ( y ; y ℓi ; x i ) = E y [ e (cid:0) r ( T i ( y ℓi ) (cid:0) t ) V ℓi ( y ℓi ; (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ; x i ) ] where V ℓi ( y ; (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ; x i ) = E y [ ∫ T j ( (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ) t e (cid:0) r ( s (cid:0) t ) (cid:25) Mℓi ( x i ) Y s d s + ∫ 1 T j ( (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ) e (cid:0) r ( s (cid:0) t ) (cid:25) Dℓi ( x i ) Y s d s (cid:0) F i ] = 8 > < > : y(cid:25) Mℓi ( x i ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F i (cid:0) (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ( (cid:25) Mℓi ( x i ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓi ( x i ; 1 ) ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) ( y (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ) (cid:12) for y (cid:20) (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) ; y(cid:25) Dℓi ( x i ; 1 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F i for y > (cid:22) y fj ( x i ) : If (cid:12)rm i is a leader and can choose its location and the entry threshold irrespective of the other’s strategy , the value function is expressed as V ℓ (cid:3) i ( y ) = max ( yℓi ; xi ) y ℓi (cid:21) 0 ; x i 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] ^ V ℓi ( y ; y ℓi ; x i ) : ( 11 ) 12 We de(cid:12)ne ( (cid:22) y Sℓi ; x Sℓi ) to be the entry threshold and the location that attain ( 11 ) . It is worth noting that V ℓ (cid:3) i does not take into account the preemptive action by the other (cid:12)rm j . In other words , V ℓ (cid:3) i may not be the value function of (cid:12)rm i in equilibrium even if it is actually a leader . Now , we investigate the outcome of the SPNE . Following Pawlina and Kort ( 2006 ) , three types of equilibria can occur : sequential , preemptive , and simultaneous . The leader’s location choice and threshold are key to investigate the equilibrium , because the follower’s strategy for location and entry timing is dominant in that the follower chooses its location x j = 1 and threshold (cid:22) y fj after the leader enters the market . 4 . 1 Sequential equilibrium Here , we consider the (cid:12)rst type of equilibrium , sequential equilibrium . In the beginning , we discuss suﬃcient conditions for a sequential equilibrium to occur . One simple and apparent suﬃcient condition is that (cid:24) 2 ( y ; x 1 ; x 2 ) (cid:20) 0 for any y 2 ( 0 ; (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) ) , x 1 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] , and x 2 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] , where (cid:24) 2 ( y ; x 1 ; x 2 ) (cid:17) V ℓ 2 ( y ; (cid:22) y f 1 ( x 2 ) ; x 2 ; 1 ) (cid:0) V f (cid:3) 2 ( y ; x 1 ) : The inequality means that (cid:12)rm 2 has no incentive to be a leader before it decides to enter the market as a follower in any situation . Another suﬃcient condition is as follows . De(cid:12)ne the lowest level of the state variable y at which (cid:12)rm 2 becomes willing to enter the market as a leader y (cid:24) 2 ( x 1 ; x 2 ) = inf f y (cid:21) 0 ; (cid:24) 2 ( y ; x 1 ; x 2 ) > 0 g for (cid:12)xed ( x 1 ; x 2 ) . 15 Suppose on the contrary to the above trivial condition that (cid:24) 2 ( y ; x 1 ; x 2 ) > 0 for some ( y ; x 1 ; x 2 ) 2 ( 0 ; 1 ) (cid:2) [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] (cid:2) [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] . If (cid:22) y Sℓ 1 (cid:20) y (cid:24) 2 ( x 1 ; x 2 ) for any x 1 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] 15 We set y (cid:24) 2 = 1 if (cid:24) 2 (cid:20) 0 for any ( x 1 ; x 2 ) . 13 and x 2 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] satisfying (cid:24) 2 ( y ; x 1 ; x 2 ) > 0 , (cid:12)rm 1 actually enters the market before (cid:12)rm 2 becomes willing to do so as a leader . Then , a sequential equilibrium occurs . Intuitively , if the cost asymmetry between the two (cid:12)rms is substantial , there is only a sequential equilibrium . In other words , a sequential equilibrium occurs if (cid:20) = F 2 = F 1 , the magnitude of cost asymmetry , is suﬃciently high . 16 Pawlina and Kort ( 2006 ) show the necessary and suﬃcient condition for a sequential equilibrium to occur in their model where two (cid:12)rms only consider the optimal entry timing , not choosing their locations . Now , we suppose that a sequential equilibrium occurs . Then , ( 11 ) is actually the value function of the leader before the time of its entry , and the optimal strategy is given by ( (cid:22) y Sℓ 1 ; x Sℓ 1 ) . To derive ( (cid:22) y Sℓ 1 ; x Sℓ 1 ) , we calculate ^ V ℓ 1 ( y ; y ℓ 1 ; x 1 ) = ( (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) y ℓ 1 r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) [ (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ] (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) ( y ℓ 1 (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) ) (cid:12) (cid:0) F 1 ) ( y y ℓ 1 ) (cid:12) : ( 12 ) From ( 12 ) with ( 10 ) , the maximization problem of the leader is formulated as max ( yℓ 1 ; x 1 ) y ℓ (cid:21) 0 ; x 1 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] ^ v ℓ 1 ( y ℓ 1 ; x 1 ; (cid:12) ) ; where ^ v ℓ 1 ( y ℓ 1 ; x 1 ; (cid:12) ) = [ (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) y ℓ 1 (cid:0) ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) ) F 1 ] ( y ℓ 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:12) (cid:0) [ (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ] ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ) F 2 ) 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) : Thus , we have the (cid:12)rst - order condition with respect to y ℓ 1 to obtain (cid:22) y Sℓ 1 ( x 1 ) = (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) F 1 : ( 13 ) Now , we are ready to show the following lemma regarding x Sℓ 1 . Lemma 4 . There are constants (cid:12) and (cid:12) such that ( i ) x Sℓ 1 = 1 = 2 for (cid:12) > (cid:12) , 16 We numerically show in Section 5 . 3 that this intuition is correct , in the sense that a type of equilibrium switches from a preemptive equilibrium to a sequential one as (cid:20) increases . 14 ( ii ) x Sℓ 1 = 0 for (cid:12) < (cid:12) . Proof . After diﬀerentiating ^ v ℓ 1 with respect to x 1 , we substitute ( 13 ) to obtain @ ^ v ℓ 1 @ x 1 = (cid:25) Mℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ) ( y ℓ 1 ) 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) (cid:0) [ (cid:25) Mℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ] ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ) F 2 ) 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) (cid:0) ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) ) [ (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ] ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ) F 2 ) (cid:0) (cid:12) ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) ) (cid:25) Df ′ 2 ( x 1 ) (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ) 2 F 2 = ( (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 ) 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) [ ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) F 1 ) 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) (cid:25) Mℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) F 2 ) 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) (cid:2) ( [ (cid:25) Mℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ] + ( (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 ) [ (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ] (cid:25) Df ′ 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ) ] : ( 14 ) If (cid:12) ! 1 , the right - hand side of ( 14 ) converges to (cid:25) Dℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) , which is always negative . On the other hand , consider the ratio of the (cid:12)rst and the second terms in the square bracket of ( 14 ) : ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) F 1 ) 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) (cid:25) Mℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ) ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) F 2 ) 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) ( [ (cid:25) Mℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ] + ( (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 ) [ (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ] (cid:25) Df ′ 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) ) = ( F 2 = (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) F 1 = (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) ) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 ( (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 ) (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) (cid:25) Mℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ) (cid:25) Df ′ 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) + 1 (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ; 1 ) (cid:25) Mℓ ′ 1 ( x 1 ) : It follows from L’H ^ o pital’s Theorem that the above equation diverges if (cid:12) ! 1 since F 1 = (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) < F 2 = (cid:25) Df 2 ( x 1 ; 1 ) . Therefore , we con(cid:12)rm that ( 14 ) is positive for any x 1 if (cid:12) is suﬃciently large . Now the lemma follows from noting that all functions to be examined are continuous . Note that the volatility (cid:27) aﬀects only through the parameter (cid:12) and that @ (cid:12) = @ (cid:27) < 0 . The above proposition implies that in a sequential equilibrium , the location of the leader is the center , if the volatility of the market size is suﬃciently small . On the other hand , if the uncertainty over the future size of the market is suﬃciently large , the optimal location of the 15 leader in a sequential equilibrium moves closer to the edge . The observation is presented in the following proposition . Proposition 1 . There exist constants (cid:27) and (cid:27) such that ( a ) x Sℓ 1 = 1 = 2 for (cid:27) < (cid:27) , ( b ) x Sℓ 1 = 0 for (cid:27) > (cid:27) . As we already showed in Lemma 2 , the follower chooses its location at x f 2 = 1 to minimize the price competition between the two (cid:12)rms . Given this fact , there are three eﬀects concerning a decision on the location by the leader . First , when the cash (cid:13)ows before the follower enters are considered , it is optimal for the leader to be located at 1 = 2 . This maximizes the leader’s monopolistic pro(cid:12)t by charging a higher price while still attracting all consumers . Second , being located at 1 = 2 deters the future entry by the follower , since the price competition becomes severe and causes a delay of the follower’s entry . Third , when the cash (cid:13)ows after the follower enters are considered , being located at 1 = 2 is less attractive for the leader (cid:12)rm because it maximizes price competition in a duopolistic situation . It is a well known result in the real options literature that when uncertainty is large , a value of waiting with entry seems to be high , leading to the follower’s late entry . Then , the leader’s monopoly period being likely to last long , the (cid:12)rst eﬀect should dominate the third eﬀect and the leader should choose x ℓ 1 = 1 = 2 . However , Proposition 1 is inconsistent with the above intuition . How can this be understood ? We learn the above interpretation through mathematical analysis . First , we rewrite ( 12 ) at y = y ℓ 1 as ^ V ℓ 1 ( y ℓ 1 ; y ℓ 1 ; x 1 ) = (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) y ℓ 1 r (cid:0) (cid:11) [ 1 (cid:0) ( y ℓ 1 (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) ) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 ] + (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( x 1 ) y ℓ 1 r (cid:0) (cid:11) ( y ℓ 1 (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) ) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 (cid:0) F 1 : ( 15 ) Equation ( 15 ) shows that the value function of the leader is the weighted average of the monopolistic and duopolistic cash (cid:13)ows with weight ( y ℓ 1 = (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) ) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 . It should also be noted 16 that ( y ℓ 1 (cid:22) y f 2 ) (cid:12) = E y [ e (cid:0) r ( T f 2 ( (cid:22) y f 2 ) (cid:0) T ℓ 1 ( y ℓ 1 ) ) ] : Therefore , the weight is closely related to the discount factor for the period T f 2 (cid:0) T ℓ 1 with rate r . Thus , the change in the volatility (cid:27) has an impact on ( i ) the monopolistic pro(cid:12)ts represented by (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( x 1 ) y ℓ 1 r (cid:0) (cid:11) , ( ii ) the follower’s entry timing represented by ( y ℓ 1 (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) ) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 , ( iii ) the duopolistic pro(cid:12)ts represented by (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( x 1 ) y ℓ 1 r (cid:0) (cid:11) . We can present some intuitive explanation on the negative relationship between (cid:27) and x Sℓ 1 in the following manner . Suppose that (cid:27) becomes large . For (cid:12)xed y ℓ 1 and y f 2 , the weight ( y ℓ 1 = y f 2 ) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 in ( 15 ) becomes large and close to 1 , since y ℓ 1 = y f 2 < 1 and (cid:12) is decreasing in (cid:27) . This implies that the leader should take this into more account for the future situation where the two (cid:12)rms face (cid:12)ercer price competition . To put it diﬀerently , if the eﬀect of x 1 on the monopolistic cash (cid:13)ow is rather small , then the leader (cid:12)rm should give more importance to the future cash (cid:13)ow , causing its location to be close to 0 . From our result , we can say that a (cid:12)rm should consider uncertain future cash (cid:13)ows rather than the current ones in the case of higher uncertainty . Our result in Proposition 1 is consistent with the results of the extant papers in this sense , and contributes to the literature by presenting the impact of volatility on the (cid:12)rms’ positioning strategies in an eﬀective manner . In the literature on standard real options , most studies consider the case of the optimal entry timing alone . Then , (cid:27) positively aﬀects the value function of the leader alone through the second eﬀect . However , under our setting , where each (cid:12)rm chooses the timing as well as location , the problem is not simple , with results diﬀering from those in the standard model . In fact , Section 5 presents other novel results due to the multi - dimensionality of strategies . 17 Finally , by substituting x Sℓ 1 for each case in Proposition 1 , we have the following propo - sition stating the outcomes of SPNE . Proposition 2 . Let ( y Eℓ 1 ; y Ef 2 ; x Eℓ 1 ; x Ef 2 ; p Eℓ 1 ; p Ef 2 ) be the equilibrium solution of the locations , thresholds , and prices . Then , we have the following three cases . ( a ) If Equation ( 14 ) is positive for any x 1 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] , the outcome of the subgame perfect equilibrium is expressed as ( y Eℓ 1 ; y Ef 2 ; x Eℓ 1 ; x Ef 2 ; p Eℓ 1 ; p Ef 2 ) = ( y (cid:3) 1 ; y (cid:3) 2 ; x (cid:3) 1 ; x (cid:3) 2 ; p (cid:3) 1 ; p (cid:3) 2 ) , where y (cid:3) 1 (cid:17) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 4 ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) ) F 4(cid:22) u (cid:0) c ; y (cid:3) 2 (cid:17) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 144 ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) ) (cid:20)F 25 c ; x (cid:3) 1 (cid:17) 1 2 ; x (cid:3) 2 (cid:17) 1 ; p (cid:3) 1 t (cid:17) { p M 1 ( x (cid:3) 1 ) = (cid:22) u (cid:0) c 4 for t 2 [ T 1 ( y (cid:3) 1 ) ; T 2 ( y (cid:3) 2 ) ) p D 1 ( x (cid:3) 1 ; x (cid:3) 2 ) = 7 c 12 for t 2 [ T 2 ( y (cid:3) 2 ) ; 1 ) ; p (cid:3) 2 t (cid:17) p D 2 ( x (cid:3) 1 ; x (cid:3) 2 ) = 5 c 12 for t 2 [ T 2 ( y (cid:3) 2 ) ; 1 ) : The consumer at (cid:22) x (cid:3) (cid:17) 712 is indiﬀerent between purchasing the good from (cid:12)rm 1 and purchasing it from (cid:12)rm 2 . ( b ) If Equation ( 14 ) is negative for any x 1 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] , the outcome of the subgame perfect equilibrium is expressed as ( y Eℓ 1 ; y Ef 2 ; x Eℓ 1 ; x Ef 2 ; p Eℓ 1 ; p Ef 2 ) = ( y (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ; y (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ; x (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ; x (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ; p (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ; p (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ) , where y (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 (cid:17) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) ) F (cid:22) u (cid:0) c ; y (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 (cid:17) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 2 ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) ) (cid:20)F c ; x (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 (cid:17) 0 ; x (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 (cid:17) 1 ; p (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 t (cid:17) { p M 1 ( x (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ) = (cid:22) u (cid:0) c for t 2 [ T 1 ( x (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ) ; T 2 ( x (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ) ) p D 1 ( x (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ; x (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ) = c for t 2 [ T 2 ( x (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ) ; 1 ) ; p (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 t (cid:17) p D 2 ( x (cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ; x (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ) = c for t 2 [ T 2 ( x (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ) ; 1 ) : The consumer at (cid:22) x (cid:3)(cid:3) = 12 is indiﬀerent between purchasing the good from (cid:12)rm 1 and purchasing it from (cid:12)rm 2 . 18 Remark 1 . We cannot analytically prove the presence of an inner solution ( y Eℓ 1 ; y Ef 2 ; x Eℓ 1 ; x Ef 2 ; p Eℓ 1 ; p Ef 2 ) = ( y (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ; y (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ; x (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ; x (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ; p (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) 1 ; p (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) 2 ) with x (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) 1 2 ( 0 ; 1 = 2 ) when (cid:12) < (cid:12) < (cid:12) . Fortunately , from our numerical analysis , there is an inner solution under a wide range of parameter settings if (cid:12) is intermediate and (cid:22) u is large enough . Proposition 2 with Remark 1 shows three cases for the leader’s location in our sequential equilibrium . Which case occurs depends on the parameters describing the dynamics of the market size (cid:11) , (cid:27) , and so on . To grasp the intuition behind the two propositions , we proceed with a numerical analysis in Section 5 . 4 . 2 Preemptive equilibrium Second , we consider another type of equilibrium , namely , preemptive equilibrium . Pawlina and Kort ( 2006 ) de(cid:12)ne a preemptive equilibrium as the situation in which (cid:12)rm 2 , which is disadvantaged in an investment cost , has an incentive to become the leader . In this case , (cid:12)rm 1 needs to note that (cid:12)rm 2 would enter the market before the state variable Y reaches the optimal threshold for (cid:12)rm 1 . Assume that y (cid:24) 2 ( x Sℓ 1 ; x 2 ) < (cid:22) y Sℓ 1 for some x 2 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] . In this case , (cid:24) 2 ( y ; x Sℓ 1 ; x 2 ) > 0 for some y 2 ( y (cid:24) 2 ( x Sℓ 1 ; x 2 ) ; y Sℓ 1 ) , meaning that (cid:12)rm 2 has an incentive to become a leader in the interval . Hence , (cid:12)rm 1 should take the following two actions : ( i ) lowering the entry threshold y ℓ 1 to deter the other (cid:12)rm’s entry , and ( ii ) changing its location x 1 to (cid:12)t with the adjusted entry threshold y 1 . If (cid:12)rm 1 chooses y ℓ 1 for the entry threshold as a leader , the location should be ~ x 1 ( y ℓ 1 ) = argmax x 1 2 [ 0 ; 1 = 2 ] V ℓ 1 ( y ℓ 1 ; (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) ; x 1 ) : ( 16 ) Let (cid:22) y Pℓ 1 and x Pℓ 1 be the entry threshold and the location of (cid:12)rm 1 in a preemptive equilibrium . With (cid:22) y Pℓ 1 and x Pℓ 1 , the other (cid:12)rm has no incentive to be a leader for y < (cid:22) y Pℓ 1 . In other words , 19 (cid:22) y Pℓ 1 and x Pℓ 1 satisfy (cid:22) y Pℓ 1 = y (cid:24) 2 ( x Pℓ 1 ; x (cid:24) 2 ( x Pℓ 1 ) ) and x Pℓ 1 = ~ x 1 ( (cid:22) y Pℓ 1 ) ; where x (cid:24) 2 ( x 1 ) is de(cid:12)ned by the equation (cid:24) 2 ( y (cid:24) 2 ( x 1 ; x (cid:24) 2 ) ; x 1 ; x (cid:24) 2 ) = 0 : From the above observation , a preemptive equilibrium is rather complicated and seems hard to solve , analytically . More concretely , x Pℓ 1 is the solution of the non - linear equations x = ~ x 1 ( y (cid:24) 2 ( x ; x (cid:24) 2 ( x ) ) ) and the function ~ x 1 ( (cid:1) ) includes the maximization problem ( 16 ) . The diﬃculty in our case comes from the fact that the payoﬀ of a Hotelling - type model is a cubic function with respect to the state variable . 17 In the next section , we numerically calculate the optimal strategies , if an equilibrium is of a preemptive - type , and conduct comparative statics to examine how the volatility or other parameters aﬀect both (cid:12)rms’ entry thresholds and locations . Note for the numerical calculation that the leader’s equilibrium location x Pℓ 1 is derived from the fact that x Pℓ 1 = sup X Pℓ 1 ; where X Pℓ 1 = f 0 g ∪ { x 1 2 ( 0 ; 1 = 2 ] ; @ @ x 1 V ℓ 1 ( y (cid:24) 2 ( x 1 ; x (cid:24) 2 ) ; (cid:22) y f 2 ( x 1 ) ; x 1 ) > 0 } : ( 17 ) 4 . 3 Simultaneous equilibrium Finally , let us consider a simultaneous equilibrium and show that it cannot occur . Lemma 5 . A simultaneous equilibrium cannot occur as an outcome of SPNE . 17 On the contrary , Huisman and Kort ( 2015 ) assume a quadratic payoﬀ function , which allows them to explicitly solve a preemptive equilibrium . 20 Proof . Let ^ V Ti be the value function of (cid:12)rm i in the case of a simultaneous equilibrium . In a simultaneous equilibrium , the optimal locations are apparently given by ( x 1 ; x 2 ) = ( 0 ; 1 ) . Therefore , if y T is the entry threshold of both (cid:12)rms , we have ^ V Ti ( y ; y T ) = 8 > > > > < > > > > : ( (cid:25) T y T r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F i ) ( y y T ) (cid:12) ; y < y T ; (cid:25) T y r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F i ; y (cid:21) y T ; where (cid:25) T = c 2 : De(cid:12)ne (cid:16) 1 ( y ; x ) = ^ V ℓ 1 ( y ; y T ; x ) (cid:0) ^ V T 1 ( y ; y T ) ; (cid:16) 2 ( y ) = V f (cid:3) 2 ( y ) (cid:0) ^ V T 2 ( y ; y T ) : A necessary condition that a simultaneous equilibrium happens is ( i ) (cid:16) 1 (cid:20) 0 for all y 2 [ (cid:22) y Sℓ 1 ; (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ] , and ( ii ) (cid:16) 2 (cid:20) 0 for all y 2 [ y T ^ (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ; y T _ (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ] . First , we suppose that x Sℓ 1 > 0 . Since (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) < (cid:22) y f 2 ( x Sℓ 1 ) , we have V T (cid:3) 2 ( y ; y T ) (cid:20) ^ V T 2 ( y ; (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ) = V f 2 ( y ; (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ; 0 ; 1 ) < V f (cid:3) 2 ( y ) = V f 2 ( y ; (cid:22) y f 2 ( x Sℓ ) ; x Sℓ 1 ; 1 ) for y < y f 2 ( 0 ) , implying that a sequential equilibrium dominates a simultaneous equilibrium for (cid:12)rm 2 . Suppose next that x Sℓ 1 = 0 . Since ( x 1 ; x 2 ) = ( 0 ; 1 ) for both sequential and simultaneous equilibria , (cid:12)rm 2 always enters the market at y = (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) irrespective of the type of equilibrium . However , (cid:16) 1 ( y ; x Sℓ 1 ) = y(cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( 0 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F 1 (cid:0) (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ( (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( 0 ) (cid:0) (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( 0 ; 1 ) ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) ( y (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ) (cid:12) 21 (cid:0) ( (cid:25) Dℓ 1 ( 0 ; 1 ) (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F 1 ) ( y (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ) (cid:12) = y(cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( 0 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F 1 (cid:0) ( (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( 0 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F 1 ) ( y (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ) (cid:12) : We now show that (cid:16) 1 ( y ; x Sℓ 1 ) > 0 for some y < (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) . Diﬀerentiating (cid:16) 1 ( y ; x Sℓ 1 ) with respect to y , we have (cid:16) ′ 1 ( y ; x Sℓ 1 ) = (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( 0 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) (cid:12) ( (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( 0 ) r (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:0) F 1 ) y (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) (cid:12) : Therefore , (cid:16) ′ 1 ( 0 ; x Sℓ 1 ) = (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( 0 ) = ( r (cid:0) (cid:11) ) > 0 and (cid:16) ′ 1 ( (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ; x Sℓ 1 ) = (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 r (cid:0) (cid:11) { (cid:0) (cid:25) Mℓ 1 ( 0 ) + F 1 F 2 (cid:25) Df 2 ( 0 ; 1 ) } < 0 : Since (cid:16) 1 ( 0 ; x Sℓ 1 ) = (cid:0) F 1 < 0 and (cid:16) 1 ( (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) ; x Sℓ 1 ) = 0 , we have (cid:16) 1 > 0 for y close to (cid:22) y f 2 ( 0 ) . This implies that a sequential equilibrium dominates a simultaneous equilibrium for (cid:12)rm 1 in the case x Sℓ 1 = 0 . We can argue for the case of x Pℓ 1 , in a manner similar to x Sℓ 1 , which completes the proof Intuitively , when there is no cash (cid:13)ow in advance of the entry , the two (cid:12)rms have no incentive to coordinate under cost asymmetry , and hence , a simultaneous equilibrium cannot occur . 5 Numerical Analysis In this section , we investigate the underlying properties of our model using numerical analysis in depth . 22 5 . 1 The eﬀect of volatility This subsection numerically examines how the volatility (cid:27) aﬀects the leader’s location x Eℓ 1 . As we have already seen , the type of equilibrium is mainly determined by the cost asymmetry . That is , a sequential equilibrium occurs if the cost asymmetry is signi(cid:12)cant , and a preemptive equilibrium occurs otherwise . Therefore , we analyze with two cases , in one of which case the value of (cid:20) is large , and in the other of which it is small . Other parameter values are given in Table 1 . (cid:22) u c r (cid:11) F 30 1 0 . 1 0 . 099 100 Table 1 : Base case parameter values . Case 1 ( (cid:20) = 10 ) : We consider the situation where the cost asymmetry is large . It can be checked using numerical calculations that a sequential equilibrium in fact occurs irrespective of the volatility (cid:27) . The outcomes of SPNE ( the locations , entry thresholds , and prices of both (cid:12)rms ) are pre - sented in Table 2 for (cid:27) 2 f 0 : 0001 ; 0 : 1 ; 0 : 2 : : : ; 1 g , con(cid:12)rming the analytical result in Proposi - tion 2 . That is , x Eℓ 1 = 1 = 2 for a small (cid:27) and x Eℓ 1 = 0 for a large (cid:27) . Further , x Eℓ 1 is decreasing in (cid:27) and is between 0 and 1 / 2 when (cid:27) takes an intermediate value , again con(cid:12)rming the existence of an inner solution . 18 Several important observations are obtained from the numerical results in Table 2 . First , we brie(cid:13)y discuss how the volatility (cid:27) in(cid:13)uences the thresholds x Eℓ 1 and x Ef 2 . Table 2 shows that the locations of the two (cid:12)rms x Eℓ 1 is decreasing in (cid:27) , whereas x Ef 2 = 1 always holds . Thus , (cid:27) aﬀects only the equilibrium location of (cid:12)rm 1 . Numerical calculations con(cid:12)rm the validity of Lemma 2 and Proposition 1 . 18 We conclude with numerical calculations for a wide variety of parameter settings that x Eℓ 1 is non - increasing in (cid:27) , even for an inner solution . 23 (cid:27) x Eℓ 1 x Ef 2 (cid:22) x E y Eℓ 1 y Ef 2 p Mℓ 1 p Dℓ 1 p Df 2 0 : 0001 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 336 576 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 1 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 353 605 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 2 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 404 692 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 3 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 488 837 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 4 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 607 1039 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 5 0 : 241 1 0 : 540 0 : 767 703 29 : 42 0 : 820 0 : 698 0 : 6 0 : 108 1 0 : 518 0 : 961 677 29 : 20 0 : 924 0 : 860 0 : 7 0 : 018 1 0 : 503 1 : 191 712 29 : 04 0 : 988 0 : 976 0 : 8 0 1 0 : 5 1 : 451 842 29 1 1 0 : 9 0 1 0 : 5 1 : 744 1012 29 1 1 1 0 1 0 : 5 2 : 072 1202 29 1 1 Table 2 : The outcome of the subgame perfect equilibrium in Case 1 with (cid:20) = 10 . In this case , a sequential equilibrium occurs . Second , we discuss the relationship between y Eℓ 1 or y Ef 2 and (cid:27) . To investigate the eﬀect of (cid:27) , the following decomposition is useful : d y Eki d (cid:27) = d y Eki ( (cid:12) ( (cid:27) ) ; x Eℓ 1 ( (cid:27) ) ) d (cid:27) = @ y Eki @ (cid:12) @ (cid:12) @ (cid:27) + @ y Eki @ x 1 @ x Eℓ 1 @ (cid:27) ; ( i ; k ) = ( 1 ; ℓ ) ; ( 2 ; f ) : ( 18 ) We call the (cid:12)rst term of ( 18 ) the option eﬀect ; this is induced through the parameter (cid:12) . The option eﬀect always appears in a standard real options model , and is monotonically increasing in the volatility (cid:27) . The second term of ( 18 ) , called the location eﬀect , is the eﬀect induced through the leader’s location x Eℓ 1 . The location eﬀect is new in the literature and should be considered in the model where the strategy of each (cid:12)rm is multi - dimensional . The eﬀect of (cid:27) on the threshold of the leader (cid:12)rm , y Eℓ 1 can be explained as follows . Note again that the (cid:12)rst term of ( 18 ) is strictly positive . For the second term , we easily verify that @ y Eℓ 1 = @ x 1 and @ x Eℓ 1 = @ (cid:27) are both non - positive . In other words , the option and location eﬀects are both positive and the leader’s threshold is always increasing with respect to volatility . However , the story is diﬀerent for the eﬀect of (cid:27) on y Ef 2 . Although the option eﬀect is still positive for y Ef 2 , the location eﬀect , or the eﬀect of (cid:27) via the leader’s location , can be negative , because @ y Ef 2 = @ x 1 > 0 and @ x Eℓ 1 = @ (cid:27) < 0 when x Eℓ 1 is on ( 0 ; 1 = 2 ) . In other 24 words , the option eﬀect is positive but the location eﬀect can be negative for the follower’s threshold if the equilibrium has an inner solution . Further , the total eﬀect ( 18 ) is negative if the location eﬀect dominates the option eﬀect . Our numerical result shows that this can happen with our parameter setting ( see y Ef 2 when (cid:27) = 0 : 4 ; 0 : 5 , and 0 : 6 in Table 2 ) . Now , let us explain why (cid:27) has a negative eﬀect on y Ef 2 if it takes an intermediate value . If x Eℓ 1 = 0 or x Eℓ 1 = 1 = 2 , the follower knows that the leader would not change its location x Eℓ 1 for a marginal change in (cid:27) and thus considers only the option eﬀect , leading to (cid:27) having a positive eﬀect on y Ef 2 . On the other hand , if x Eℓ 1 is between 0 and 1 / 2 , the follower actually takes the marginal change of x Eℓ 1 that aﬀects the present value of its own future pro(cid:12)t (cid:13)ows . Since the leader chooses a location closer to 0 , the present value of the follower becomes higher and the follower can enter the market more easily . Hence , the follower optimally chooses a lower y Ef 2 . Mason and Weeds ( 2010 ) show that the threshold of a leader is non - monotonic if there is a positive externality . However , to the best of the authors’ knowledge , the negative eﬀect of the volatility on a threshold for some parameter settings is new in the real options literature under the assumption of a negative externality . Our model setup in which each (cid:12)rm optimizes the threshold and location , con(cid:12)rms the importance of the analysis of multi - dimensional strategies . Case 2 ( (cid:20) = 1 : 1 ) : We consider the situation where the cost asymmetry is small . It can be checked using numerical calculations that a preemptive equilibrium in fact occurs irrespective of the volatility (cid:27) . The outcomes of SPNE ( the locations , entry thresholds , and prices of both (cid:12)rms ) in a preemptive equilibrium are presented in Table 2 for (cid:27) 2 f 0 : 0001 ; 0 : 1 ; 0 : 2 : : : ; 1 g . A similar observation to Case 1 is obtained from the above results . First , the location of the leader x Eℓ 1 is monotonically decreasing in the volatility (cid:27) , meaning that the product diﬀerentiation widens as the demand uncertainty becomes larger . Second , the eﬀect of (cid:27) on 25 (cid:27) x Eℓ 1 x Ef 2 (cid:22) x E y Eℓ 1 y Ef 2 p Mℓ 1 p Dℓ 1 p Df 2 0 : 0001 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 050 63 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 1 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 052 67 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 2 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 059 76 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 3 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 069 92 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 4 0 : 5 1 0 : 583 0 : 083 114 29 : 75 0 : 583 0 : 417 0 : 5 0 : 236 1 0 : 539 0 : 117 77 29 : 42 0 : 824 0 : 704 0 : 6 0 : 102 1 0 : 517 0 : 161 74 29 : 19 0 : 929 0 : 867 0 : 7 0 : 011 1 0 : 502 0 : 225 77 29 : 02 0 : 993 0 : 985 0 : 8 0 1 0 : 5 0 : 280 93 29 1 1 0 : 9 0 1 0 : 5 0 : 336 111 29 1 1 1 0 1 0 : 5 0 : 399 132 29 1 1 Table 3 : The outcome of the subgame perfect equilibrium in Case 2 with (cid:20) = 1 : 1 . In this case , a preemptive equilibrium occurs . the follower’s entry threshold y Ef 2 is not monotonic ( See y Ef 2 when (cid:27) = 0 : 4 ; 0 : 5 ; 0 : 6 in Table 3 ) . The eﬀect is negative if (cid:27) takes an immediate value , or in a situation where an equilibrium has an inner solution x Eℓ 1 2 ( 0 ; 1 = 2 ) . As we have already explained , the leader (cid:12)rm should give more importance to the future situation , if uncertainty of the cash (cid:13)ow is higher . Thus , the leader takes the duopoly market into more account with a higher (cid:27) , and x Eℓ 1 is non - increasing as a result . We con(cid:12)rm the analytical result in Proposition 1 with numerical examples . 5 . 2 The eﬀect of growth rate In this subsection , we investigate the eﬀect of (cid:11) on the leader’s location , by conducting a comparative statics with numerical calculations . Here , we study Case 1 ( (cid:20) = 10 ) , meaning that a sequential equilibrium occurs . 19 Figure 1 illustrates how the parameters (cid:27) and (cid:11) aﬀect the equilibrium location of the leader . We observe from the (cid:12)gure that the leader’s location is decreasing in (cid:11) . In other words , the leader optimally locates itself at the center if the market grows slowly in average . 19 We omit the analysis in Case 2 , because similar observations are obtained . 26 Figure 1 : The relationship between x Eℓ 1 and (cid:11) with diﬀerent values of (cid:27) . Especially , x Eℓ 1 = 1 = 2 ways holds when (cid:11) = 0 : 096 ; this is depicted at the upper left - hand side . When (cid:11) = 0 : 099 the location of the leader depends on the volatility (cid:27) ; x Eℓ 1 = 0 : 5 if (cid:27) (cid:20) 0 : 4 and x Eℓ 1 = 0 if (cid:27) (cid:21) 0 : 75 . Ebina et al . ( 2015 ) obtain a similar result with their numerical analysis on pages 908 { 910 . An intuitive explanation on the above observation can be presented as follows . A large value of (cid:11) means the rapid market size growth on average , inducing the follower to enter the market earlier . Then , the leader should avoid price competition with the follower . Thus , the leader (cid:12)rm optimally chooses x Eℓ 1 = 0 . 5 . 3 The eﬀect of cost asymmetry Next , we consider how the degree of asymmetry (cid:20) aﬀects the equilibrium outcome . Table 4 shows the eﬀect of (cid:20) on the outcome of SPNE when (cid:27) = 0 : 5 . First , we can see from Table 4 that a preemptive equilibrium occurs for a smaller (cid:20) , and a sequential equilibrium for a larger (cid:20) . The reason is almost self - evident . If the asymmetry 27 (cid:20) x Eℓ 1 x Ef 2 y Eℓ 1 y Ef 2 Type of Equilibrium 1 . 1 0 . 2359 1 0 . 1166 77 Preemptive 2 0 . 2341 1 0 . 2338 99 Preemptive 3 0 . 2329 1 0 . 3779 149 Preemptive 4 0 . 2319 1 0 . 5336 198 Preemptive 5 0 . 2311 1 0 . 6994 248 Preemptive 6 0 . 2326 1 0 . 7669 415 Sequential 7 0 . 2353 1 0 . 7668 487 Sequential 8 0 . 2376 1 0 . 7667 558 Sequential 9 0 . 2396 1 0 . 7667 631 Sequential Table 4 : The outcome of the subgame perfect equilibrium with diﬀerent values of (cid:20) . The type of equilibrium changes at (cid:20) between 5 and 6 . in costs becomes large , the entry of the follower (cid:12)rm is signi(cid:12)cantly late in comparison to the leader’s entry . Thus , the leader does not need to take the follower’s entry timing into consideration and can optimally choose when to enter . Second , we observe that the leader (cid:12)rm locates itself farther from the center as the cost asymmetry becomes larger in the case of a preemptive equilibrium . On the other hand , if a sequential equilibrium occurs , the leader’s location is closer to the center . The above obser - vations imply that the eﬀect of cost asymmetry diﬀers , depending on the type of equilibrium . The intuition for the eﬀect of (cid:20) is as follows . It should be noted that the leader’s lo - cating itself closer to the center has two eﬀects on the follower’s strategy . The (cid:12)rst one is positive for the leader in that it enjoys higher monopolistic pro(cid:12)ts and deters the follower’s entry . The second one is negative in that it lowers its pro(cid:12)ts in a duopolistic market . In a preemptive equilibrium where a disadvantaged (cid:12)rm has an incentive to become a leader , the leader should deter the other (cid:12)rm’s entry by entering the market earlier . The leader’s earlier entry to preempt signi(cid:12)es the importance of the discounted sum of instantaneous monopoly pro(cid:12)ts . To increase the discounted sum , the leader needs to locate closer to the center when preemption occurs . If (cid:20) increases from a lower level ( e . g . , (cid:20) = 1 : 1 in Table 4 ) , the leader’s entry timing gets delayed ( see y Eℓ 1 in Table 4 ) , implying that the discounted sum of instanta - 28 neous monopoly pro(cid:12)ts becomes less important and x Eℓ 1 decreases . On the other hand , in a sequential equilibrium where (cid:20) is large , the leader (cid:12)rm is not forced to enter earlier and sets its threshold satisfactorily . In fact , (cid:20) hardly aﬀects the leader’s threshold in each sequential equilibrium in Table 4 . On the contrary , a higher value of (cid:20) means a higher entry cost F 2 in this analysis , leading to a higher entry threshold of the follower . Thus , if the cost asymmetry is large , the leader (cid:12)rm can enjoy a longer monopoly cash (cid:13)ow , and sets its location to be closer to the center . 5 . 4 The eﬀect of transportation cost Finally , we investigate the eﬀects of the transportation cost c on the leader’s location . In our setting , an agent who is located far from the (cid:12)rm should pay high transportation costs . Therefore , given the (cid:12)xed length of the Hotelling line , we can interpret that widening the market area corresponds to the increase in the transportation cost parameter c . Figure 2 illustrates how the parameter c aﬀects the equilibrium location of the leader . Again , we study Case 1 with (cid:20) = 10 and (cid:27) = 0 : 3 , where a sequential equilibrium occurs . One can con(cid:12)rm that the equilibrium location of the leader is decreasing in c , implying that the distance between the two (cid:12)rms is increasing as market areas are widened . Our theoretical result is closely related to the empirical (cid:12)nding presented by Thomadsen ( 2007 ) , who computationally investigates the product positioning ( location ) strategies of two asymmetric (cid:12)rms in the fast food industry , McDonald’s and Burger King , in the United States . In his study , McDonald’s is advantaged in cost and quality and can (cid:12)rstly choose its positioning ( leader in our study ) , whereas Burger King is disadvantaged and secondly chooses it ( follower in our study ) . The major (cid:12)ndings by Thomadsen ( 2007 ) are that ( 1 ) McDonald’s and Burger King should pursue diﬀerent location strategies , which means that the minimum diﬀerentiation never occurs , and that ( 2 ) under some conditions , McDonald’s prefers locating at or near the center , whereas Burger King tries to locate far away from McDonald’s to attract diﬀerent types of customers . In addition , the prices set by McDonald’s and Burger King are 29 Figure 2 : The relationship between the transportation cost c and the equilibrium location of the leader x Eℓ 1 . increasing as the two (cid:12)rms are located farther apart in most cases . These results seem consistent with ours , as shown in Proposition 2 and Table 2 . Note that Ebina et al . ( 2015 ) also obtain similar results as the above with a model where no uncertainty exists . However , our (cid:12)ndings strengthen Thomadsen ( 2007 ) in the following sense . If the demand evolves stochastically , the volatility signi(cid:12)es the tendency that a leader locates farther away from the center . This means that demand uncertainty is also one of the causes for Thomadsen ( 2007 ) ’s (cid:12)ndings . In summary , our theoretical results give one possible explanation on the empirical results . 6 Conclusion In this article , we construct a Hotelling - type spatial model with uncertainty of market demand in a real options framework . Contrary to the standard real options literature , the strategy of each (cid:12)rm is multi - dimensional in that each (cid:12)rm maximizes its value function with respect 30 to multiple variables , entry timing , and location . This multi - dimensional approach leads to many interesting results . One important (cid:12)nding is that the threshold of the follower is not monotonically increasing in volatility , which is new in the literature , and can be obtained only with multi - dimensional strategies . Further , although the follower’s entry timing tends to be late as the volatility increases , the leader is more likely to locate at the edge as the volatility gets higher . Finally , we mention three possible directions for future studies . The (cid:12)rst is to consider a circular city model , which is another representative model of spatial competition . The second is to study an oligopoly model where more than two (cid:12)rms consider market entry . The third is to generalize the stochastic process Y . Considering these extensions are useful to clarify relationships between (cid:12)rms’ locations , their thresholds , and a level of the volatility . However , as a (cid:12)nal remark , we argue that the results obtained in this study are not restrictive and can be applied to many actual competitive situations . References Bonanno , G .
