Virtual reality check : a comparison of virtual reality , screen - based , and real world settings as research methods for HRI Jana Plomin 1 * , Paul Schweidler 2 and Astrid Oehme 2 1 Fraunhofer Fokus , Digital Public Services , Berlin , Germany , 2 HFC Human - Factors - Consult GmbH , Berlin , Germany To reduce costs and effort , experiments in human - robot interaction can be carried out in Virtual Reality ( VR ) or in screen - based ( SB ) formats . However , it is not well examined whether robots are perceived and experienced in the same way in VR and SB as they are in the physical world . This study addresses this topic in a between - subjects experiment , measuring trust and engagement of an interaction with a mobile service robot in a museum scenario . Measures were made in three different settings , either the real world , in VR or in a game - like SB and then compared with an ANOVA . The results indicate , that neither trust nor engagement differ dependent on the experimental setting . The results imply that both VR and SB are eligible ways to explore the interaction with a mobile service robot , if some peculiarities of each medium are taken into account . KEYWORDS virtual reality , human - robot interaction , method , embodiment , service robot , human - centered design ( HCD ) 1 Introduction Robots are becoming more proficient in performing numerous assistive tasks like transportation and manipulation , and their social capabilities , e . g . , in communication and entertainment , increase as well . With that extending range of abilities also comes a broader field of possible applications . Robots are not only used in professional environments with highly skilled and trained personnel but also in private and public spaces , populated with user groups of all kinds . This diversification of both , tasks and domains , opens up a vast , rich and complex design space for developers and researchers to explore ( Schweidler et al . , 2020 ) . Studies exploring that design space have been , and continue to be , conducted . The details of those studies vary , depending on whether they are psychological experiments , user tests , or field research—but in any case , variation of the stimulus ( that is , the robot ) is key to the method . This need for variation poses two challenges specific to the field of human - robot interaction ( HRI ) : First , building and customizing robots is ( still ) complicated . Once an initial prototype has been built , fundamental design changes quickly become costly and difficult to implement . Second , letting humans interact with robot prototypes can be dangerous when modifications to the robot’s soft - or hardware are not rigorously tested—which again is costly and time - consuming . Frontiers in Robotics and AI 01 frontiersin . org Plomin et al . 10 . 3389 / frobt . 2023 . 1156715 To tackle these challenges a common workaround is to show subjects images or videos of robots , followed by questionnaires surveying their perception of the robot . This is problematic , since a robot presented in an image or video can be evaluated differently and might elicit a different behavior than a real robot ( Li , 2015 ) . Although researchers are aware of that loss of external validity ( Bartneck , 2003 ; Wainer et al . , 2007 ; Kiesler et al . , 2008 ; Hoffmann et al . , 2018 ) , SB representations like pictures , videos or game - like scenarios are prevailing as test objects . A promising way to solve the problems associated with either method , i . e . , theuseofSBrepresentationsorrealrobots , respectively , may lie in the use of virtual reality environments ( VR ) . VR compared to experiments with physical comes with a relative ease of implementation and low physical risks to subjects . And although even high - fidelity VR environments are not perfect reproductions of the real world ( Groom et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2019 ) , VR stands out for its immersiveness . In a VR system with a head - mounted display , the subject is presented with the images on a screen of the VR headset that is close to the eye ( Bente et al . , 2002 ) , allowing a three - dimensional all - around view of the environment . As sensors on the VR headset detect the position and orientation of the head , the environment is always presented behaviorally adapted . The subject perceives rich and accurate information about their environment , especially when he or she is able to navigate the virtual environment through bodily motion . As the bodily motion becomes congruent with the ( expected ) change of the visual field in the simulated environment , the impression to be physically situated in this environment is reinforced ( Sherman and Craig , 2018 ) . The use of special controllers representing virtual hands within the VR environment may further increase the three - dimensional impression , as well as the feeling of being physically present within the VR environment ( Schuemie et al . , 2001 ) . The virtual hands can also be used to actively change the environment ( Loomis et al . , 1999 ) —e . g . , to interact directly with the VR robot . Additionally , sounds played through headphones on the VR headset enhance the three - dimensional impression ( Loomis et al . , 1999 ) and reduce distraction by external acoustic stimuli ( Lum et al . , 2018 ) . The knowledge of being exposed to illusory stimuli recedes into the background , the subject has the impression of being physically situatedinthevirtualspace , ofbeinginthemiddleofitinsteadofjust being close ( Witmer et al . , 2005 ; Sherman and Craig , 2018 ) . There is evidence that virtual representations do not even require high naturalness to elicit valid effects ( Schaefer et al . , 2015 ) . The viewer may well be aware to be confronted with an artificial environment and yet show the same behavior as in the unmediated real world ( Dotsch and Wigboldus , 2008 ; Rinck et al . , 2010 ) . Consequently , VR environments provide the experimenter with the opportunity to observe actual , real - world - like behavior , not just to ask them about behavioral intentions as with screen - based ( SB ) representations . At the same time the conditions in a VR environment , as with a SB representation , can be controlled strictly to investigate the effects of the independent variables and to ensure high internal validity . All the above intuitively makes VR a suitable way to conduct experiments in HRI and some work has been done pursuing this intuition : Studies comparing VR and SB are suggestive of a general validity and usefulness of VR as a research method ( Wainer et al . , 2007 ; Kiesler et al . , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2017 ; Whitney et al . , 2020 ) . ComparingfeelingstowardsVRvs . realrobots specifically , Inoue et al . ( 2005 ) found no significant differences , while Kamide et al . ( 2014 ) found that , although subjects did not show a different behavior , they reported different feelings towards the robot in VR compared to the one in the real world ( RW ) . Likewise , a recent study by Wijnen et al . ( 2020 ) found differences in the feelings and behavior towards a robot in VR vs . RW . However , this study did not compare the VR directly to the RW condition , instead replicating a previous RW study by Kahn et al . ( 2015 ) in VR . The authors critically note that their VR condition probably did not replicate the original study by Kahn et al . ( 2015 ) closely enough and as such perhaps caused the differences observed . To our knowledge , however , no work has been done comparing all three different conditions , i . e . , RW , VR , and SB , in one coherent paradigm , using the same robot and scenario . With the goal to provide methodological decision support for HRI researchers , we designed and conducted an experiment examining the effect of the research method on two common HRI measures : engagement and trust . 1 . 1 Engagement Engagement is one of the central constructs of HRI ( Steinfeld et al . , 2006 ) , evaluating whether a robot attracts attention and arouses a persistent interest in the interaction . This interest is especially important when the robot’s task is to convey information ( Kidd and Breazeal , 2004 ) . Studies observing that a real robot is perceived more entertaining ( Wainer et al . , 2007 ; Leite et al . , 2008 ) and elicits more attention ( Kennedy et al . , 2015 ) than a SB - robot . According to Steinfeld et al . ( 2006 ) the VR environment offers more interaction possibilities than a SB environment , because the subject can get in contact with the robot with his virtual hands . It is hypothesized that due to these greater interaction opportunities , the subjects will be more engaged within the VR condition than in the SB condition . Consequently , it is hypothesized that : H1 . Subjects in the RW and VR condition are more engaged than subjects in the SB condition . However , due to the novelty effect , it is assumed that the subjects initially show increased engagement and interest , which decreases over time ( Smedegaard , 2019 ) . It is therefore hypothesized that : H2 . In all three conditions engagement will decrease over time . 1 . 2 Trust Trust is another prominent construct in HRI research ( Steinfeld et al . , 2006 ) and a central precondition for a positive interaction between human and robot to emerge ( Sanders et al . , 2011 ; van Pinxteren et al . , 2019 ) . Studies have shown that physical proximity between human and robot is an important trust building factor ( Bainbridge et al . , 2008 ; Billings et al . , 2012 ) . The findings of Bainbridge and colleagues ( 2008 ) suggest that humans tend to trust rather a real robot than a robot presented on a screen . If a robot behaves and performs as expected , it contributes to building trust towards the robot ( Kidd and Breazeal , 2004 ) . In contrast to a robot presented on a screen , a VR robot can interact Frontiers in Robotics and AI 02 frontiersin . org Plomin et al . 10 . 3389 / frobt . 2023 . 1156715 with a human in a three - dimensional space in the same way as a real robot can . Therefore , it is hypothesized that : H2 . 1 . Subjects in the RW and VR condition will perceive a comparable level of trust in the robot that varies from the trust perceived by subjects in the SB condition . Due to the interaction experience with the robot it is furthermore predicted that : H2 . 2 . The level of trust in the robot changes over time . To account for the contradictory findings concerning the behavior shown vs . the feelings reported ( Kamide et al . , 2014 ) , both variables , engagement and trust , will be assessed through self - report and complemented by behavioral measures . 2 Method and material 2 . 1 Participants 34 German - speaking subjects were recruited and received a compensation of 20 Euros after participation . Four subjects were excluded due to technical problems with data logging . Our final sample included 30 subjects ( 15 males , 15 females ) , with age ranging from 19 to 78 ( M = 41 . 73 , SD = 21 . 03 ) . Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three between - subjects conditions , balancing for age and gender . 2 . 2 Scenario The subjects experienced a tour through an art gallery , guided by a robot . When the robot and the subject arrived at a painting , the robot started telling some facts about the artwork . When the robot was done , the subject could choose to either hear more information about the current painting ( the robot had been equipped with three chunks of information for each artwork ) or to move on to the next painting . Toavoidsystematicinfluencesoforder , fivedifferentroutes through the gallery were randomly assigned to the subjects . 2 . 3 Technical implementation The study was conducted at a lab of HFC Human - Factors - Consult GmbH in Berlin . We used the robot Temi 1 , a wheeled , armless service robot equipped with a touch - screen ( Figure 1 ) . The VR and SB simulation were developed using the Unreal Engine Editor 2 with a 3D model of the robot . We used an HTC Vive 3 system for interaction with the VR environment . The SB simulation was presented on a 30 - inch screen and stereo loudspeakers . The subjects could navigate the gallery using a gamepad 4 . The environment , the 1 https : / / www . robotemi . com / . 2 https : / / www . unrealengine . com / en - US / . 3 https : / / www . vive . com / de / . 4 https : / / www . xbox . com / de - DE / accessories / controllers / xbox - wireless - con - troller . robot , and the interaction were designed as similar as possible for all three conditions ( see Figure 1 ) . All subjects experienced a typical white cube gallery measuring 6 × 5 m with five paintings ( five - way points ) displayed on the walls ( see Figure 2 ) . The paintings were all similar in size , style and originator . 2 . 4 Measurements To ensure comparability of the results to other studies , established questionnaires were chosen for engagement and trust . In addition to the questionnaires , two typical behavioral measures were assessed . The reported engagement was captured using the subscale interest / enjoyment of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory ( IMI ; Deci and Ryan , 2003 ; German version : own translation ) . The inventory surveys the entertainment and interest elicited by a certain activity on a 7 - point Likert scale and is often used in MRI studies ( Zaga , 1995 ; Schuler et al . , 2011 ) . The inventory was complemented by the observed engagement , operationalized by measuring the time of each interaction , a frequently used indicator for motivation and engagement in MRI research in general ( Sidner et al . , 2005 ; Steinfeld et al . , 2006 ; Powers et al . , 2007 ) , and especially in the context of museum robots ( Bickmore et al . , 2013 ) . The interaction time was defined as the period during which the subject listened to the robot in front of a single painting ( waypoint ) . It was assumed that the longer the interaction lasted , the more interested and engaged the subject was . The interaction time was measured for all five waypoints ( within - subject factor interaction experience ; see Figure 2 ) and compared between the three conditions ( between - subject factor condition ; see Figure 1 ) . The Trust Perception Scale - HRI questionnaire ( TPS - HRI ; Schaefer , 2016 ; German version : own translation ) measures the perceived trust and was used in the short version with 14 items to capture the reported trust . Subjects could indicate how much of the time they perceived the robot as trustworthy on a 10 % - stepped scale . The questionnaire is well suited to compare trust in robots between different scenarios ( Schaefer , 2016 ) . The reported data was complemented by continuously measuring the chosen distance to the robot as the distance can be interpreted as a behavioral measure for trust ( Deligianis et al . , 2017 ) . The measure was averaged for the time subject and robot stood in front of the painting at each of the five - way points and will be referred to as ‘observed trust’ . 2 . 5 Procedure The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions . Prior to the experiment , they were informed about the procedure and that they could take as much time as they wanted to look at each painting . In the VR and SB condition , the experimental session was preceded by a training session , where subjects could navigate a completely empty virtual room to get familiar with the virtual environment , to adjust the VR headset to their individual needs ( sharpness of the image reproduction , volume of sounds ) , and to get used to the game - pad . The training sessions lasted approximately 2 min .

The VR state image is a montage of the exterior view and an expanded view of what was shown on the VR goggles . FIGURE 2 A floor plan of the gallery , indicating the 5 paintings / way points . Depending on the condition , subjects then experienced the gallery tour with the robot under one of the three conditions ( RW , VR , SB ) . After the experiment , subjects completed the questionnaires , and received their compensation and a short debriefing . 2 . 6 Experimental design Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical program ( IBM Corp . , 2013 ) . Test power calculation was performed with the software G * Power ( Faul et al . , 2007 ) . Prior to the inferential statistical analysis , the preconditions of the respective methods were examined . An exploratory data analysis did not detect any extreme outliers ( defined as three times the interquartile range ) . The variables were tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro - Wilk test . The data were normally distributed , p > . 05 , unless otherwise reported in the results section . For data analysis , analyses of variance were mainly calculated , as they are considered to be relatively robust to violation of the normal distribution ( Glass et al . , 1972 ; Rasch and Guiard , 2004 ) . In addition , all variables were tested for variance homogeneity using Levene’s test . When variance homogeneity was given , a not too conservative post hoc analysis , the Tukey test , was chosen because the focus of the study was to test the null hypothesis ( comparison of the RW and VR conditions ) . In the case of violation of variance homogeneity , a Welch ANOVA , and for post hoc analyses , the Games - Howell test was applied . When sphericity was violated in repeated - measures analyses , a Greenhouse - Geisser correction was applied to the degrees of freedom . The scores of IMI and TPS - HRI were submitted to a one - way ANOVA , to analyze the reported engagement and trust . At each of the five waypoints the subject´s behavior ( interaction time and distance to the robot ) was measured and later compared between the conditions . In both cases , a 3 × 5 mixed ANOVA with the between - subject factor condition ( RW , VR , SB ) and the within - subject factor waypoint ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) was used . In addition , the initial following distance to the robot when the subjects were guided to the first waypoint was analyzed using a one - way ANOVA . By default , a significance level of α = 0 . 05 was assumed . Only for the post hoc comparison of the RW vs . VR condition a significance level of α = 0 . 20 was used , as a null hypothesis was tested .

No differences were found in negative attitudes towards robots ( NARS ) , affinity for technology interaction ( ATI ) , immersive tendency ( ITQ ) and interest in art . All control variables were analyzed for correlation with the perceived and demonstrated engagement and trust . No significant correlations were found . In order to get a qualitative overview of the experiment , we observed each subject unobtrusively but not secretly . We could see that some subjects in the SB condition navigated the gallery in a random manner . After the experiment one of these subjects stated : “I still felt unsure in the beginning how to handle the gamepad” . Therefore , we had a closer explorative look at the data and our observation was confirmed : During the walk to the first waypoint ( initial following distance ) , the SB condition with the gamepad showed a greater variance in the distance values ( SB : M = 1 . 98 , SD = 0 . 63 ) than in the other two conditions ( RW : M = 0 . 74 , SD = 0 . 23 ; VR : M = 0 . 98 , SD = 0 . 20 ) . The control variable previous experience in game - pad use did not show significant correlation with the initial following distance . However , the six subjects who had never used a game - pad before showed a higher variance on that score ( M = 2 . 24 , SD = 0 . 70 ) than the four subjects who had used a gamepad at least once ( M = 1 . 58 , SD = 0 . 15 ) . 3 . 2 Engagement The descriptive statistics of the IMI score suggest that subjects in the RW and VR condition felt more engaged compared to the subjects in the SB condition ( RW : M = 5 . 20 , SD = 1 . 01 ; VR : M = 5 . 21 , SD = 0 . 91 , SB : M = 4 . 56 , SD = 1 . 10 ) , yet the ANOVA results did not support that impression [ F ( 2 , 27 ) = 1 . 38 , p = . 268 , η 2p = . 09 , power = 27 . 1 % ] . For the behavioral engagement , the descriptive data indicated that on average , for the five - way points , the subjects in the RW condition listened to the robot the longest , followed by those in the VR and SB condition . However , there was no evidence for a statistical significant effect [ F ( 2 , 27 ) = 2 . 51 , p = . 100 , η 2 p = . 16 , power = 67 . 3 % ] , so the hypothesis that subjects in the RW and VR condition are more engaged than subjects in the SB condition ( H1 . 1 ) is rejected . No evidence was found for a main effect of way point , F ( 4 , 108 ) = . 59 , p = . 673 , η 2p = . 02 , power = 59 . 7 % . The three conditions showed no changes in their interaction time across the five - way points , which leads us to reject the hypothesis that in all three conditions engagement will decrease over time ( H1 . 2 ) . Frontiers in Robotics and AI 05 frontiersin . org Plomin et al . 10 . 3389 / frobt . 2023 . 1156715 3 . 3 Trust The descriptive values of the TPS - HRI show the lowest ratings in the VR condition ( M = 78 . 79 , SD = 8 . 45 ) , followed by the SB condition ( M = 81 . 71 , SD = 7 . 14 ) and the RW condition ( M = 83 . 86 , SD = 12 . 50 ) . Again , the difference between the three conditions was not statisticallysignificant ( F ( 2 , 27 ) = 0 . 70 , p = . 506 , η 2p = . 05 , power = 15 . 5 % ) . Concerning the observed trust , the first measure analyzed was the initial value , i . e . , the average distance between human and robot when the subjects were guided to the first waypoint . Shapiro - Wilk tests revealed that the normality assumption was violated for condition SB , indicating a higher probability of type II error . However , a one - way factorial ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference between the three conditions , Welch - test F ( 2 , 16 . 45 ) = 17 . 01 , p < . 001 , η 2p = . 66 , power = 99 % . For post hoc comparisons , see Table 1 . The following section presents the distances per waypoint to analyze the development of trust over time . The Shapiro - Wilk test wereviolatedforwaypoints2 ( ofSBcondition ) , 4 ( ofRWcondition ) , and 5 ( of VR condition ) . Levene’s test was violated for four of the five waypoints ( p < . 05 ) . Homogeneityofthecovariancematriceswasnot given according to the Box test ( p < . 001 ) . Mixed ANOVA showed a statistically significant interaction between the factors condition and waypoint , Greenhouse - Geisser F ( 4 . 89 , 65 . 96 ) = 4 . 71 , p = . 001 , η 2p = . 26 , power = 91 . 5 % . Figure 3 illustrates the means and standard deviations of the three conditions . Evidence was found for a significant main effect of condition , F ( 2 , 27 ) = 14 . 06 , p < . 001 , η 2p = . 51 , power = 99 . 8 % . The results of the Games - Howell post hoc test are shown in Table 1 . As predicted , the VR condition did not differ from the RW condition at all five - way points . While the SB condition differed from the other two conditions at the first way points , no difference between all three conditions was observable at the last way point . No clear evidence could be provided for H2 . 1 , as there are no more differences between the three conditions at the end of the recorded time span . H2 . 1 , stating that the SB condition will differ in the level of trust , and that only RW and VR will be the same , is therefore rejected . No evidence was found for a main effect of way point , Greenhouse - Geisser F ( 2 . 44 , 65 . 96 ) = . 672 , p = . 543 , η 2p = . 02 , power = 52 % . The three conditions showed no changes in their distances to the robot across the five - way points . Games - Howell post hoc tests showedasignificantdifferenceonlyintheSBconditionbetweenway point 1 and 4 ( 0 . 46 , p = . 021 ) . Thus , the hypothesis that the level of trust in the robot changes over time ( H2 . 2 ) is rejected . 4 Discussion Wedesignedandconductedanexperimenttocomparetheeffect of three experimentation methods , i . e . , real world , virtual reality and screen based , on trust and engagement in an interaction with a mobile service robot . The main hypothesis was that real world and virtual reality will produce similar results , whereas the screen - based paradigm will yield lower ratings in trust and engagement . While the first part of that hypothesis is supported by the findings , the second part is not . There was no evidence for an effect of the experimentation method used on the perceived or demonstrated engagement , or perceived trust . Neither did the demonstrated trust , FIGURE 3 Distance between subject and robot for each condition across the five interactions . Mean values with + / - 1 standard deviation . measured by the distance participants took to the robot , differ effectively between any of the conditions . It is noteworthy , though , that the initial distance participants took to the robot was in fact different for the SB compared to other conditions in the beginning of the experiment , but converged over time . These results are difficult to interpret , as non - significant differences can always be due to an insufficient test - power . However , the fact that the differences between VR and RW are not large enough to become significant at an alpha threshold of . 20 , can be seen as a clear indicator that the results obtained under either condition are very similar . In the questionnaire data , the descriptive patterns of the PQ and IMI indicate that the use of a VR robot instead of a SB robot may lead to more valid results . However , at least with the present test power , the difference was not statistically significant . In particular for the self - report measures , a new study with more subjects would be meaningful , to further its significance . The TPS - HRI is not considered due to its questionable internal reliability in this study ( Cronbach’s α = . 64 ) . In the SB condition , subjects could not use their own bodies to move through the gallery , as in the RW and VR condition . Instead , they could only navigate their point of view through the gallery using a gamepad . This way of “locomotion” is less intuitive . During the walk to the first waypoint ( initial following distance ) , the SB condition showed a greater variance in the distance values than in the other two conditions . To examine this descriptive finding , the correlation of the control variable previous experience in gamepad use with initial following distance was tested . The correlation test was not significant . Since the SB condition consisted of only 10 subjects , results should be interpreted with caution . However , descriptive statistics indicate that especially the subjects who had never used a gamepad before ( N = 6 ) showed a higher variance in their distance values than subjects who had used a gamepad before ( M = 2 . 24 , SD = 0 . 70 and M = 1 . 58 , SD = 0 . 15 ) . Another explanation why subjects in the SB condition initially maintained a greater distance might be due to the limited field of view of the SB representation . Two subjects explained that they had maintained a greater distance in order to be able to see both the painting and the robot on the screen . The subjects did not have the feeling that the robot was next to them when they were standing close to the painting , as in the VR and RW conditions—simply Frontiers in Robotics and AI 06 frontiersin . org Plomin et al . 10 . 3389 / frobt . 2023 . 1156715 because the robot was outside their field of view . These statements of the subjects are a further explanation for the greater distance in the SB condition . The repetitive study design may explain why subjects navigated closer with the gamepad with each painting : They were now aware that the robot would always position himself to their right . In all three conditions , the paintings were equally positioned and accessible from all sides . Nevertheless , there may have been a default position where the paintings in the gallery were best seen which influenced the position of the subject regardless of the presence of the robot . In a further study it would be interesting to compare the distances with and without the robot . It could help to identify more precisely the peculiarities of the HRI , independently of the systematic comparison of the three conditions that our study addressed . A qualitative difference between the conditions was the use of the robot display . In the RW and VR condition , the subjects had to approach the robot to handle the display with their real or virtual hands . This was not required in the SB condition , as the interaction was controlled by the buttons on the gamepad . This difference is not considered a methodological shortcoming of the study design . Rather , it reflects the inherent characteristics of the technologies the study was exploring . The more informative is the findingthat , despitethedifferentwaysofhandlingtherobot’sdisplay , the subjects in the VR and SB condition chose a comparable distance to the robot as in the RW condition after some time . Differences like these possibly influence the distance between humans and robots regardless of trust . Our study does not claim to explore the reasons why trust in robots develops . Rather , we would like to systematically compare whether distance behavior , as a common operationalization in HRI for trust , is similar across the three conditions . A VR environment seems more useful than a SB representation to obtain valid results on distance behavior alreadyatthebeginningoftheexperiment . InSB , subjectsneedmore time to get used to locomotion and gaze positions . This finding is generally applicable to the survey of distances , as distance is also used as an operationalization of other constructs , such as respect ( Bainbridge et al . , 2008 ; Takayama and Pantofaru , 2009 ) . The study is characterized by a careful implementation of the requirements for a direct comparison between the experimental conditions . In addition to an identical visual representation of the gallery and the robot , comparable auditory stimuli were presented ( e . g . , the engine sound of the robot ) . The common finding , that SB robots were rated differently from real robots ( Wainer et al . , 2007 ; Kiesler et al . , 2008 ; Hoffmann et al . , 2018 ) cannot be replicated in the present study . This may be due to the fact that in most of these studies , the SB robots are presented as photographs or video recordings ( e . g . , Wainer et al . , 2007 ) . These robots , unlike the SB robot that we presented in our study in a computer game , do not offer direct interaction with one another . Our results indicate that interactive SB representations , presented in a similar way to computer games , may be used equivalently to VR and RW environments to measure behavioral responses . The findings of the distance behavior partly explain the mixed findings from previous studies . While Kamide et al . ( 2014 ) showed that no significantly different distance is taken to a VR and real robot , the study of Li et al . ( 2019 ) indicated the opposite finding . Our study showed that the differences between the VR and RW are only present at the beginning , on the way to waypoint 1 . Measuring the distance only once would have supported the findings by Li et al . ( 2019 ) . Only the repeated measurement revealed that the distances inallthreegroupsconvergeinthelongterm . Ourresultssuggestthat with increasing experience with the technology , differences between groups diminish . Although the initial implementation of the virtual world that was used for the VR and the SB testing was laborious , subsequent adaptions and adjustments to the environment , the robot , and the interaction could be done quickly and without much effort . This variabilityandthefindingsofourstudymakeinteractivesimulations a very interesting option for HRI experiments , especially compared to non - interactive screen - based designs . Since only five points in time were sampled , the explanatory power of the study is limited . It cannot be proven that the different distances at the beginning were training / familiarization effects in the SB ( and VR ) condition . A prolonged test or higher resolution time series would be helpful to explore the unfolding of the distance values over time . For further studies , it would be advisable to schedule longer training sessions to minimize initial differences , especially when a game pad is being used . Due to the inherent properties of the technical devices , the distances are not directly comparable between the conditions . As the subjects in the VR and SB conditions interacted with a virtual robot , the robot was able to pass through the subjects’ body and the subject was able to pass through the robots’ body . Even though neither was observed , this knowledge may have influenced the distancing behavior . An obvious limitation of our study is the small sample size . This wasmainlycausedbyCOVID - 19restrictionstakingeffectrightwith the beginning of our study . We tried to mitigate the effect by at least balancing the numbers of subjects for each condition . Nonetheless , this hampers the interpretation of results and should be addressed in a subsequent study . We focused on the analysis of the behavioral measures . A subsequent study with higher test power would be especially interesting for the self - report measures to find out more about the perception of the three conditions . Given all the limitations , it is difficult to draw any general conclusions . The results can , however , be seen as an indicator , that both , virtual reality environments as well as screen - based game - like scenarios are appropriate ways to explore a close interaction between human and a mobile service robot . The results further show , that when screen - based HRI experiments are to be conducted , participants must be given sufficient time to accommodate to the interaction technology , otherwise it might mask the interaction between human and robot . Otherwise , screen - based interaction paradigms appear to be more eligible if only reported instead of behavioral measures are to be explored and should be implemented carefully and as interactively as possible . VR has proven to being able to produce results quite similar to an experiment in the real world for both behavioral and reported measures . However , to make more general claims , additional studies with higher numbers of participants and with a greater variety of HRI scenarios must follow .
