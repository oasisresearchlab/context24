Research Article Introduction Bin - amphiphysin - Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain - containing superfamily members , including extended Fes - CIP4 homology ( EFC ) / FCH - BAR ( F - BAR ) domain - containing subfamily members , such as FCHo2 , FBP17 , Toca - 1 , CIP4 , PACSINs / syndapins and others , sculpt membranes according to the curvature of their three - dimensional structures ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Shimada et al . , 2010 ) . The positively charged surface of the domain binds to the negatively charged inner surface of the plasma membrane , thereby bending the membrane according to its protein structures . The various BAR domain surface curvatures are thought to correlate with the diverse invaginations and protrusions of cells . The BAR domain proteins engaged in the formation of clathrin - coated pits , filopodia and spines have been well characterized , in contrast to those participating in forming other subcellular structures ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2010 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . PACSINs ( protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons proteins ) and syndapins , which include three paralogs ( Modregger et al . , 2000 ) , consist of an F - BAR domain and an SH3 domain . The SH3 domain binds to dynamin and the actin - nucleating protein N - WASP ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Simpson et al . , 1999 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . PACSIN1 / syndapin - I is implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling in the brain ( Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) , and PACSIN3 expression is specific to muscles ( Modregger et al . , 2000 ) . Although PACSIN2 / syndapin - II is expressed ubiquitously ( Modregger et al . , 2000 ) , its functions remain to be elucidated . The membrane tubulation activity of the F - BAR domain is autoinhibited in full - length PACSIN1 ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . We found that this autoinhibition is also conserved in PACSIN2 , since full - length PACSIN2 exhibited weaker membrane tubulation ability than the F - BAR domain fragment ( Shimada et al . , 2010 ) . The crystal structure of full - length PACSIN1 suggested that the autoinhibition is mediated by an interaction between the SH3 and F - BAR domains ( Rao et al . , 2010 ) . The F - BAR domain of PACSIN2 possesses a deeper concave surface than those of FBP17 and CIP4 ( Shimada et al . , 2010 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Correspondingly , the membrane tubules induced by the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain have smaller diameters ( ~ 50 nm ) than those induced by the F - BAR domains of FCHo2 , FBP17 , CIP4 and Toca - 1 ( Shimada et al . , 2010 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Caveolae are flask - shaped invaginations with diameters of approximately 50 nm to 100 nm ( Mundy et al . , 2002 ; Palade and Bruns , 1968 ; Parton and Simons , 2007 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ; Yamada , 1955 ) . This diameter size might correspond to that of the tubules induced by the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain . Dynamin is also localized at the neck of caveolae ( Henley et al . , 1998 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ) , and is involved in the fission of caveolae during their endocytosis . The recently identified cavin family proteins , including polymerase I and transcript release factor ( PTRF ) / cavin - 1 , reportedly promote caveola biogenesis ( Hill et al . , 2008 ) . Caveolin - 1 is suggested to induce the formation of membrane tubules in the absence of PTRF ( Verma et al . , 2010 ) . In the present study , we analyzed the function of PACSIN2 - induced tubulation in caveolae . We found that the cellular tubules induced by the F - BAR domain of PACSIN2 contained caveolin - 1 , but less PTRF . Surprisingly , caveolin - 1 interacted directly with the F - BAR domain of PACSIN2 to release its autoinhibition , thus allowing membrane tubulation . Abnormally - shaped caveolin - 1 - containing plasma membrane invaginations were also observed in Summary Caveolae are flask - shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane that are associated with tumor formation , pathogen entry and muscular dystrophy , through the regulation of lipids , signal transduction and endocytosis . Caveolae are generated by the fusion of caveolin - 1 - containing vesicles with the plasma membrane , which then participate in endocytosis via dynamin . Proteins containing membrane - sculpting F - BAR ( or EFC ) domains organize the membrane in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Here , we show that the F - BAR protein PACSIN2 sculpts the plasma membrane of the caveola . The PACSIN2 F - BAR domain interacts directly with caveolin - 1 by unmasking autoinhibition of PACSIN2 . Furthermore , the membrane invaginations induced by the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain contained caveolin - 1 . Knockdown of PACSIN2 resulted in abnormal morphology of caveolin - 1 - associated plasma membranes , presumably as a result of decreased recruitment of dynamin - 2 to caveolin - 1 . These results indicate that PACSIN2 mediates membrane sculpting by caveolin - 1 in caveola morphology and recruits dynamin - 2 for caveola fission .

The cellular tubulation observed in cells expressing the F - BAR domain or with PACSIN2 knockdown might be caused by the lack of recruitment of dynamin - 2 to caveolae . Results Endogenous PACSIN2 colocalizes with caveolin - 1 at caveolae We examined the localization of endogenous PACSIN2 , by labeling HeLa cells with anti - PACSIN2 and anti - caveolin - 1 antibodies ( Fig . 1A , B ) . A proportion of the endogenous PACSIN2 or caveolin - 1 puncta ( 44±13 % or 48±14 % , respectively ) also exhibited caveolin - 1 or PACSIN2 staining . Importantly , exogenous green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – PACSIN2 and caveolin - 1 – DsRed exhibited 90±5 % colocalization , when these two proteins were coexpressed in HeLa cells ( Fig . 1C ) . Similar colocalization of endogenous PACSIN2 and endogenous caveolin - 1 was observed in other cells , such as 2033 PACSIN2 in caveolae Hs578T , SK - BR - 3 and BT549 cells ( supplementary material Fig . S1 ) . To further demonstrate the localization of PACSIN2 at caveolae , we examined non - transfected HeLa cells by electron microscopy . A plasma membrane sheet was prepared from HeLa cells and was labeled with anti - caveolin - 1 and anti - PACSIN2 antibodies , followed by immunogold . The PACSIN2 label was found in close proximity to the caveolin - 1 label ( Fig . 1D , E ) . The PACSIN2 label was also observed at structures lacking the caveolin - 1 label , which were smaller than caveolae ( Fig . 1E ) . Thin - section electron microscopy revealed anti - PACSIN2 antibody staining in the necks of the flask - like invaginations typical of caveolae ( Fig . 1F ) . Staining signals were also detected on the relatively flat plasma membrane and in the cytosol ( Fig . 1F ) . No signals were identified in the absence of antibody ( supplementary material Fig . S2 ) . These data suggest that PACSIN2 functions in caveolae at the plasma membrane . Fig . 1 . Localization of endogenous PACSIN2 at caveolae .

Control images without anti - PACSIN2 antibody are shown in supplementary material Fig . S2 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Overexpression of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain alters localization of caveolin - 1 The canonical F - BAR - domain - containing proteins , such as FBP17 and Toca - 1 , induce plasma membrane invagination when overexpressed in cells . These invaginations are often observed as the mesh - like localization of the overexpressed F - BAR domain proteins . The o verexpressed F - BAR domain fragment of PACSIN2 exhibited a similar mesh - like localization in HeLa cells ( Fig . 2 ) . We confirmed that this mesh - like structure corresponded to the plasma membrane invaginations , by labeling the cells with membrane - staining FM dye and the culture medium with sulforhodamine ( supplementary material Fig . S3 ) . We then examined the localization of various membrane marker proteins to the PACSIN2 F - BAR - induced mesh - like structures , and found that caveolin - 1 colocalized with PACSIN2 . In cells with low expression of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain ( Fig . 2A , left cell in large panel ) , the F - BAR domain and caveolin - 1 colocalized along the tubules induced by F - BAR domain expression . However , caveolin - 1 accumulated into several larger assemblies , which formed at the convergence of the PACSIN2 - induced invaginations in cells with high F - BAR - domain expression ( Fig . 2A , right cell in large panel ) . This caveolin - 1 accumulation was not observed in cells expressing PACSIN2 F - BAR domains with tubulation - 2034 Journal of Cell Science 124 ( 12 ) defective mutations ( M124T / M125T ) ( Shimada et al . , 2010 ) or in those expressing FBP17 ( supplementary material Fig . S4A , B ) . Importantly , the clathrin distribution was not altered by expression of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain ( supplementary material Fig . S4C ) . PTRF was only partially localized at tubules induced by the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain ( supplementary material Fig . S4D ) . Interestingly , the overexpressed PACSIN1 F - BAR domain had a weak effect on caveolin - 1 localization , whereas the overexpressed PACSIN3 F - BAR domain had a similar effect on caveolin - 1 localization as the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain ( Fig . 2B , C ) . Binding of caveolin - 1 to PACSIN2 induces membrane tubulation The substantial colocalization of PACSIN2 with caveolin - 1 upon their coexpression suggested a direct interaction between these two proteins . PACSIN2 consists of the F - BAR domain and the SH3 domain ( Fig . 3A ) . Caveolin - 1 consists of two cytoplasmic regions connected by a region embedded in the membrane ( Fig . 3A ) . We prepared several purified fragments of caveolin - 1 , and analyzed their binding to purified full - length PACSIN2 in a pull - down assay . The N - terminal cytoplasmic region of caveolin - 1 ( residues 1 – 100 or 61 – 100 ) interacted with PACSIN2 ( Fig . 3B ) . However , the association was not observed for the C - terminal cytoplasmic region of caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 3B ) . We then mapped the binding region of PACSIN2 to caveolin - 1 . Similarly to the finding that the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain alone was sufficient for colocalization with caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 2 ) , the F - BAR domain alone was sufficient for binding to caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 3C ) . The binding of caveolin - 1 to the F - BAR domain was stronger than that to full - length PACSIN2 ( Fig . 3C ) . The PACSIN2 C - terminal region , including the SH3 domain ( residues 301 – 486 ) , did not interact with caveolin - 1 in a pull - down assay with purified proteins ( supplementary material Fig . S5A ) . The association of PACSIN2 and caveolin - 1 in cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation analys is with an anti - caveolin - 1 antibody ( supplementary material Fig . S5B ) . We then examined the binding of the PACSIN1 and PACSIN3 F - BAR domains to caveolin - 1 . Consistent with the weak effect of the PACSIN1 F - BAR domain expression on caveolin - 1 localization , the PACSIN1 F - BAR domain had weak affinity to caveolin - 1 . By contrast , the PACSIN3 F - BAR domain bound well to caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 3D ) . Because the F - BAR domain binds to the membrane , we examined the binding surface of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain for caveolin - 1 with those of the F - BAR domains bearing either the R50D or M124T / M125T mutation , on the membrane - binding concave surface , and the F - BAR domain bearing the R245E mutation , on the convex surface ( Fig . 3E ) . The binding was not altered by the R50D or M124T / M125T mutation , but it was weakened by the R245E mutation ( Fig . 3C and supplementary material Fig . S5C ) . Therefore , the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain appears to bind to both caveolin - 1 and the membrane simultaneously , for the induction of caveolin - 1 - localized tubules . Interestingly , the amino acid residues conserved between PACSIN2 and PACSIN3 , but not conserved in PACSIN1 , were mapped on the convex surface of PACSIN2 ( Fig . 3E and supplementary material Fig . S6 ) . We then addressed the effect of caveolin - 1 fragment binding to the F - BAR domain in the liposome association of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain . The caveolin - 1 1 – 100 amino acid ( aa ) fragment is known to form oligomers , which precipitated upon centrifugation ( supplementary material Fig . S5D ) ( Sargiacomo et al . , 1995 ) . Fig . 2 . Overexpression of PACSIN2 F - BAR domain induces abnormal caveolin - 1 localization . ( A )  GFP - PACSIN2 F - BAR domain ( green ) was overexpressed in HeLa cells . Endogenous caveolin - 1 was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence ( red ) . Actin filaments were visualized by phalloidin staining ( blue ) . The merged image is on the left , and the individual images are on the right . Scale bar : 50  m m . ( B , C )  GFP – PACSIN1 ( B ) or GFP – PACSIN3 ( C ) F - BAR domain was overexpressed and analyzed as in A . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Therefore , the binding of the caveolin - 1 fragment to liposomes could not be examined ( supplementary material Fig . S5D ) . However , in the presence of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain , but in the absence of liposomes , the caveolin - 1 fragment did not precipitate after centrifugation , confirming the physical interaction between the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain and the caveolin - 1 fragment . The presence of the caveolin - 1 1 – 100 aa fragment did not affect the liposome binding of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain 2035 PACSIN2 in caveolae ( supplementary material Fig . S5D ) . The membrane tubulation induced by the F - BAR domain was not affected by the presence of the caveolin - 1 fragment ( data not shown ) . To confirm the caveolin - 1 binding to PACSIN2 on the tubulated membrane , we expressed the caveolin - 1 fragment with PACSIN2 in cells . The caveolin - 1 fragment was found on the PACSIN2 - induced tubular structures , indicating the interaction of PACSIN2 with the caveolin - 1 fragment on the tubulated membrane Fig . 3 .

Liposomes incubated with caveolin - 1 fragment alone ( 15  m M ) and liposomes without protein incubation are also shown . ( H )  Percentage ± s . e . m . of liposomes with > 200 nm diameters that have tubulation in G . Liposomes with smaller diameters ( < 200 nm ) lacked tubulation . Note that the diameter of tubules induced by PACSIN2 is ~ 50 – 100 nm ( Shimada et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , the liposomes with smaller diameters ( < 200 nm ) could not have tubulation . The significance to the liposomes incubated with PACSIN2 alone was calculated using the Student’s t - test . * P < 0 . 05 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e ( supplementary material Fig . S7 ) . Consistently , the cellular tubulation induced by the expression of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain was decreased by the knockdown of caveolin - 1 , suggesting that caveolin - 1 enhances the membrane localization of PACSIN2 F - BAR domain in cells ( supplementary material Fig . S8 ) . Caveolin - 1 inhibits the intramolecular interaction of PACSIN2 We next addressed the autoinhibition of PACSIN2 through the intramolecular interaction between its SH3 and F - BAR domains , by pull - down assay . We found that this interaction was decreased remarkably by incubation with the caveolin - 1 fragment ( aa 1 – 100 ) ( Fig . 3F ) . The SH3 domain of PACSIN2 is also known to bind to dynamin , and the binding to dynamin is also suggested to affect the intramolecular interaction . The intramolecular interaction was further decreased by incubation with the dynamin - derived PxxP peptide and the caveolin - 1 fragment ( Fig . 3F ) . We also examined the tubulation induced by full - length PACSIN2 in vitro . We found that the tubulation was markedly strengthened in the presence of the caveolin - 1 fragment ( Fig . 3G , H ) . The tubulation occurred more efficiently in the presence of both the caveolin - 1 fragment and PxxP peptide ( Fig . 3G , H ) . The caveolin - 1 fragment alone , or the PxxP peptide alone , had no effect on liposome morphology ( Fig . 3G , H ) . Therefore , the membrane interaction might be stimulated by the release of the SH3 domain from the F - BAR domain , thus allowing membrane tubulation in the presence of caveolin - 1 . 2036 Journal of Cell Science 124 ( 12 ) We then examined whether this mechanism functioned in cells . We expressed dynamin - 2 proline - rich peptide or the caveolin - 1 fragment with PACSIN2 in cells , and the enhancement of PACSIN2 - induced tubulation was observed , supporting the disruption of the intramolecular interaction by these two fragments ( supplementary material Fig . S7 ) . The overexpression of full - length caveolin - 1 with PACSIN2 also enhanced PACSIN2 - induced tubulation ( supplementary material Fig . S7 ) . We also co - expressed the wild - type or dominant - negative mutant of dynamin - 2 ( K44A ) with the wild - type PACSIN2 in HeLa cells , and quantified the tubulation formation . PACSIN2 - expressing cells with the dynamin - 2 K44A mutant exhibited more tubulation than the cells expressing PACSIN2 alone ( supplementary material Fig . S9 ) . The PACSIN2 - expressing cells with wild - type dynamin - 2 displayed less tubulation than the cells expressing PACSIN2 alone ( supplementary material Fig . S9 ) . The co - expression of another SH3 binding protein , N - WASP , minimally affected the tubulation ( supplementary material Fig . S9 ) . These results suggested that the tubules induced by PACSIN2 could be activated by K44A dynamin - 2 or dynamin - 2 proline - rich peptide , but were antagonized by wild - type dynamin - 2 , presumably as a result of its membrane scission activity . Knockdown of PACSIN2 alters the morphology of caveolin - 1 - associated membranes The results mentioned above indicated that PACSIN2 mediates membrane tubulation upon binding to caveolin - 1 , thus sculpting Fig . 4 .

( F , G )  Distributions of ( F ) neck width and ( G ) depth of plasma membrane invaginations with caveolin - 1 signals , quantified from ( D , E ) . The numbers of signals analyzed for ( F ) and ( G ) were approximately 100 for each experiment . The neck width is 62 ± 2 nm ( control cells ) or 79 ± 3 nm ( PACSIN2 RNAi cells ) and the p - value was calculated by the Student’s t - test . P < 0 . 05 . The depth is 106 ± 6 nm ( control cells ) or 189 ± 9 nm ( PACSIN2 siRNA cells ) and the P - value was calculated by the Student’s t - test . P < 0 . 05 . The data shown are the mean values from ﬁve ( control ) or three ( PACSIN2 siRNA ) experiments with s . e . m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e the membranes of caveolae . Therefore , we performed RNA interference ( RNAi ) of PACSIN2 and analyzed the morphology of the caveolin - 1 - associated membranes by electron microscopy . HeLa cells treated with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) to knock down PACSIN2 contained significantly less PACSIN2 ( Fig . 4A ) . The amounts of caveola - related proteins , including dynamin - 2 , caveolin - 1 and PTRF / cavin - 1 , were not affected by RNAi of PACSIN2 ( Fig . 4A ) . We then analyzed the morphology of caveolae in cells treated with PACSIN2 siRNA . These cells were labeled with an anti - caevolin - 1 antibody and then with a colloidal gold - labeled secondary antibody . Portions of the plasma membrane with caveolin - 1 in PACSIN2 siRNA cells showed non - flask - shaped invaginations ( Fig . 4B , C ) . To confirm this morphological defect , the plasma membrane associated with caveolin - 1 was traced ( Fig . 4D , E ) . Because PACSIN2 was localized at the neck of caveolae ( Fig . 1F ) , the neck width of the caveolin - associated invaginations was measured ( Fig . 4F ) . The average diameter at the neck was 62±2 nm in control siRNA cells , whereas it was 79±3 nm in PACSIN2 siRNA cells ( values are mean ± s . e . m . ; P < 0 . 05 by Student’s t - test ) , clearly indicating the function of PACSIN2 at the caveolae neck . The depths of the caveolin - associated invaginations 2037 PACSIN2 in caveolae were also measured ( Fig . 4G ) . The depths were 106±6 nm in control cells and 189±9 nm in PACSIN2 siRNA cells . Although the change in the depth of caveolae was not very large , for observations by light microscopy , the increase in the depth might suggest the failure of proteins , such as dynamin , to interact with caveolae . PACSIN2 recruits dynamin - 2 to caveolin - 1 spots for caveolae endocytosis Finally , we addressed the possible defects in dynamin recruitment to caveolae in PACSIN2 siRNA cells . The caveolae associated with dynamin - 2 are believed to execute endocytosis , and thus the quantification of dynamin - 2 localization at caveolin - 1 spots would be difficult . Therefore , we examined the localization of the dynamin - 2 K44A mutant at caveolin - 1 spots , in control and PACSIN2 siRNA cells . Many caveolin - 1 spots associated with dynamin K44A were observed in the control siRNA cells , whereas very few were detected in the PACSIN2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 5A , B ) . To confirm the defect in dynamin - 2 recruitment upon RNAi of PACSIN2 , the cells were briefly treated with an inhibitor of dynamin , dynasore , to prevent the scission of caveolae into vesicles . The cells were then stained with anti - caveolin - 1 and anti - dynamin - Fig . 5 . Role of PACSIN2 in recruitment of dynamin - 2 to caveolae .

( F , G )  A plasma membrane sheet from control ( F ) or PACSIN2 siRNA ( G ) HeLa cells was stained with an anti - dynamin - 2 antibody with a 10 - nm - gold - conjugated antibody and an anti - caveolin - 1 antibody with a 5 - nm - gold - conjugated antibody . Two representative images are shown . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 2 antibodies . The number of caveolin - 1 spots colocalized with dynamin - 2 significantly decreased upon PACSIN2 RNAi ( Fig . 5C – E ) . The defect in dynamin - 2 recruitment to caveolae in PACSIN2 siRNA cells was then examined by electron microscopy . The plasma membrane sheets of these dynasore - treated cells were prepared and then stained with these antibodies . The caveolin - 1 signals in control siRNA cells colocalized with the dynamin - 2 signals in the plasma membrane sheets . By contrast , these signals were not colocalized in the plasma membrane sheets of the PACSIN2 siRNA cells ; the dynamin signals were observed at non - caveolin - 1 - associated structures in these cells ( Fig . 5F , G ) . The distribution of caveolin - 1 signals on the plasma membrane was abnormal in the PACSIN2 siRNA cells , as observed by thin - section electron micrography ( Fig . 4C , Fig . 5G ) . We then examined whether PACSIN2 is involved in caveola - mediated endocytosis . We examined cholera toxin B ( CTxB ) incorporation into control and PACSIN2 siRNA cells , as well as PACSIN2 siRNA cells expressing wild - type or mutants of PACSIN2 . CTxB is known to bind to GM1 gangliosides , which are enriched at caveolae . The incorporated CTxB accumulated at the center of the cells , whereas the unincorporated CTxB remained at the cell periphery or at the plasma membrane . The CTxB incorporation was observed in control cells , and it was significantly decreased in cells treated with PACSIN2 siRNA ( supplementary material Fig . S10 ) . The expression of the F - BAR domain fragment of PACSIN2 induced tubular membrane invaginations with CTxB localization , supporting the idea that the F - BAR - domain - induced tubules are related to caveolae . The incorporation was restored by the expression of wild - type PACSIN2 , but not by the expression of either the R245E or M124T / M125T mutant of PACSIN2 ( supplementary material Fig . S10 ) . Discussion These results provide several lines of evidence indicating that PACSIN2 mediates the shape formation of caveolae . First , the caveolin - 1 - associated plasma membrane was not flask - shaped in PACSIN2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Second , the presence of PACSIN2 at the neck of caveolae appeared to correspond to the membrane tubulating ability in vivo ( Fig . 1 ) . Therefore , the membrane - sculpting activity of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain seems to be responsible for caveola morphology . PACSIN2 appears to recruit dynamin - 2 for caveola fission , because fewer caveolin - 1 spots containing dynamin - 2 were detected in PACSIN2 siRNA cells , and the PACSIN2 - induced tubules were antagonized by dynamin - 2 ( Fig . 5 and supplementary material Fig . S9 ) . Elongated tubules that contained caveolin - 1 were observed in the PACSIN2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Because PACSIN2 was knocked down , the elongated tubules were probably formed by proteins other than PACSIN2 in the absence of a sufficient amount of dynamin . Caveolin - 1 reportedly binds directly to dynamin ( Yao et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , an insufficient amount of dynamin - 2 might induce deeper invaginations without membrane scission . The PACSIN2 F - BAR domain binds to negatively charged phosphatidylserine at the plasma membrane . Phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] is also negatively charged , and facilitates the membrane binding of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is enriched in caveolae ( Fujita et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , the Eps15 - homology - domain containing ( EHD ) protein , which also possesses membrane - deformation ability , reportedly binds to the Asn - Pro - Phe ( NPF ) motif of PACSIN2 ( Braun et al . , 2005 ; Xu et al . , 2004 ) . The EHD 2038 Journal of Cell Science 124 ( 12 ) proteins are highly conserved eukaryotic ATPases that are implicated in caveolae formation , clathrin - independent endocytosis and recycling from endosomes , and they have membrane - tubulation ability ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ; Verma et al . , 2010 ) . An EHD protein bound to caveolae might cooperate with PACSIN2 in caveola biogenesis or caveola - mediated endocytosis . In addition , EHD proteins are present in PTRF / cavin - 1 - rich fractions ( Aboulaich et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the EHD proteins might function as bridges between cavins and PACSIN2 . Cavins are believed to facilitate the membrane shape formation of caveolae , by suppressing the formation of caveolin - 1 - localized long tubules ( Hansen et al . , 2009 ; Hill et al . , 2008 ; McMahon et al . , 2009 ; Verma et al . , 2010 ) . The limited participation of PTRF in the tubulation induced by the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain appears to be consistent with this inhibition of tubulation by PTRF ( supplementary material Fig . S4E ) . PACSIN2 was first identified as a casein kinase and protein kinase C ( PKC ) substrate ( Plomann et al . , 1998 ) , and PKC is enriched at caveolae ( Smart et al . , 1995 ) . This might also provide a key to regulate the caveola invagination mediated by PACSIN2 . The detailed time course of the recruitment of these proteins should be examined in the future , to clarify the regulation of caveola formation . Our present results reveal that the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain protein induces membrane tubulation for caveola sculpting and fission . In addition , caveolin - 1 was found to regulate the sculpting ability of PACSIN2 . Caveolae constitute platforms for various receptors , channels , and signal transduction . PACSIN2 therefore appears to be a fundamental protein that is involved in cellular homeostasis and disease ( e . g . in generation of tumors ) , through the regulation of caveolae . Interestingly , the PACSIN3 F - BAR domain was associated with caveolin , whereas the PACSIN1 F - BAR domain was not . The different affinities of the PACSIN / Syndapin paralogs to caveolin - 1 might reflect the tissue - specific variations of caveolae function . Materials and Methods Recombinant proteins and pull - down assays Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – PACSIN2 ( mouse ) , GST – PACSIN2 F - BAR domain ( EFCL ; aa 1 – 339 and EFCS aa 1 – 306 ) , GST – SH3 domain ( aa 301 – 486 or aa 387 – 486 ) , GST – PACSIN1 F - BAR domain ( mouse ) ( aa 1 – 306 ) , GST – PACSIN3 F - BAR domain ( mouse ) ( aa 1 – 306 ) and GST – caveolin - 1 fragments ( mouse ) ( amino acids 1 – 100 , 61 – 100 , and 137 – 179 ) were expressed in Escherichia coli , as described previously ( Shimada et al . , 2010 ) . GST was removed by PreScission Protease ( GE Healthcare ) . Dynamin - 1 proline - rich peptide , RSPTSSPTPQRRAPAVPPARPG , was from Bex ( Tokyo , Japan ) . Pull - down assays with the indicated fragments were performed in buffer [ 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 10 % glycerol , and 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) ] containing 2 % Triton X - 100 and the indicated protein concentrations . The purified proteins and glutathione Sepharose beads were mixed in the buffer for 1 hr at 4°C . After washing , the bound proteins were visualized by western blotting or Coomassie Brilliant Blue ( CBB ) staining after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) . EFCL was used as the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain for all of the assays , except for the comparison with PACSIN1 – PACSIN3 ( Fig . 3D ) . Liposome preparation , co - sedimentation assay and tubulation assay Liposomes were prepared from total bovine brain lipids ( Folch fraction 1 ; Avanti Polar Lipids ) ( Michelsen et al . , 1995 ) . Lipids were dried under nitrogen gas in glass test tubes and were resuspended in XB ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 9 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 and 5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid / EGTA ) , containing 100 mM sucrose , by mixing with a vortexer , and then hydrated at 37°C for 1 hour . This preparation yielded a mixture of unilamellar liposomes with various diameters ( 0 . 1 – 2 m m ) and large , multilamellar vesicles , as determined by thin - section electron microscopy . The majority of the liposomes were unilamellar . Liposome tubulation was examined by negative staining , as described previously ( Shimada et al . , 2010 ) . Proteins without GST were used in tubulation assays . The co - sedimentation assay was performed as follows . The proteins were incubated with J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 2039 PACSIN2 in caveolae liposomes ( 1 mg / ml ) in 50 m l XB for 20 minutes at room temperature ( RT ) , and were then centrifuged at 78 , 000 g for 30 minutes at 25°C in a TLA - 100 rotor ( Beckman ) . Supernatants and pellets were subjected to SDS - PAGE . Cell culture HeLa and Hs578T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , penicillin , and streptomycin . SKBR - 3 and BT549 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) medium supplemented with 10 % FCS , penicillin , and streptomycin . Immunoprecipitation Subconfluent HeLa cells in a 15 cm dish were washed with PBS , and suspended in buffer containing 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM PMSF , 10 % glycerol , 2 % Triton X - 100 , 5 mM NaF , 5 mM EDTA , 1 m g / ml aprotinin and 1 m g / ml leupeptin . The resulting cell lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 15 , 000 r . p . m . at 4°C . The supernatant was incubated with 1 m g of anti - caveolin - 1 ( 7C8 ) antibody or control IgG . After incubation for 1 hour at 4°C , Dynabeads protein A ( Invitrogen ) were added and further incubated for 1 hour at 4°C . The beads were then washed and subjected to western blot analysis . Transfection Ggreen fluorescent protein ( GFP ) , Venus and mCherry labelled PACSIN1 , PACSIN2 and PACSIN3 proteins were prepared by subcloning the mouse Pacsin1 , Pacsin2 and Pacsin3 cDNA into the pEGFP - C1 , pVenus - C1 , and pmCherry - C1 vectors ( Clontech ) , in which the GFP in pEGFP - C1 was replaced with Venus and mCherry , respectively ( Nagai et al . , 2002 ; Shaner et al . , 2004 ) . Venus is a GFP mutant with brighter fluorescence . Venus was labeled as GFP , for simplicity . The PACSIN2 – GFP and PACSIN2 – mCherry proteins were respectively expressed by the pEGFP - N3 vector ( Clontech ) and the pmCherry - N3 vector , in which the GFP in pEGFP - N3 was replaced with mCherry . The caveolin - 1 – GFP was expressed by subcloning cDNA encoding mouse caveolin - 1 into the pEGFP - N3 or pDsRed - Monomer - N1 vector . The wild - type and K44A dynamin - 2 constructs were gifts from Mark A . McNiven ( Orth et al . , 2002 ) . The wild - type , actin - polymerization - defective  VCA , and the partially active phospho - mimic Y253E were described previously ( Sasaki et al . , 2000 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2002 ) . The proline - rich region of dynamin - 2 ( aa 741 – 870 ) was subcloned into the pCMV - Tag3B vector ( Stratagene ) with a Myc tag . The siRNAs to knockdown caveolin - 1 and PACSIN2 were Stealth Select RNAi TM siRNAs , Invitrogen catalog nos . 1299003 and 1299001 , respectively , containing three oligo siRNAs that were mixed and transfected simultaneously . The control RNA for siRNA was Stealth RNAi Negative Control Duplexes ( Invitrogen ) . Transfection was performed with the Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS reagents ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocols . Dynasore ( Sigma , D7693 ) was applied to DMEM + 10 % FCS at 40 m M for 5 minutes before fixation . Sulforhodamine or FM - dye labeling of HeLa cells HeLa cells were seeded on glass - bottom dishes ( Asahi Glass , 3911 - 035 ) , transfected with the vector expressing the GFP - tagged F - BAR domain of PACSIN2 , and cultured overnight . Sulforhodamine ( Invitrogen , S359 ) was then added to the medium at a 0 . 1 mM final concentration . After 10 minutes , cells were visualized by confocal microscopy ( FV1000D , Olympus ) at 25°C . FM - dye labeling was performed basically as described previously ( Terebiznik et al . , 2002 ) . HeLa cells were seeded on glass - bottom dishes , transfected , and cultured overnight . The cells were then chilled on ice for 15 minutes , washed with HBSS supplemented with 10 mM glucose , and incubated with 10 m M FM4 - 64 on ice for 1 minute . After the medium was removed , the cells were washed twice with ice - cold HBSS supplemented with 10 mM glucose for 5 minutes , and then the cells were observed by confocal microscopy at 25°C . Immunocytochemistry The cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 5 minutes , followed by permeabilization with TBS supplemented with 1 % BSA and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 minutes and blocking with TBS supplemented with 1 % BSA for 2 hours . The anti - PACSIN2 antibody was affinity purified from the serum of rabbits immunized with the F - BAR domain protein of PACSIN2 . The rabbit monoclonal anti - caveolin - 1 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology . The mouse monoclonal anti - Myc ( clone PL14 ) and the anti - caveolin - 1 ( 7C8 ) antibodies were purchased from MBL International , and Santa Cruz Biotechnology , respectively . The anti - clathrin heavy chain ( clone 23 ) and anti - dynamin - 2 antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories . After washing , cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 and / or Alexa Fluor 568 labeled secondary antibodies and Alexa Fluor 633 phalloidin . Fluorescence images were obtained by confocal microscopy ( Olympus Fluoview 1000D ) at room temperature . A 100 (cid:2) oil - immersion objective ( NA 1 . 45 ; Olympus ) was used . The spots of certain protein staining that were recognized as particles of higher signals than the surrounding areas in each image were counted . Subsequently , if the spots contained other protein staining signals that were higher than the area surrounding the spots , then the spots were considered to be colocalization spots of the two proteins . This analysis was performed manually , with the aid of the Cell Counter Plug - in and Channel Tools of the ImageJ program ( NIH ) . Cholera toxin incorporation assay HeLa cells were labeled with Alexa - Fluor - 555 - labeled Cholera toxin B ( CTxB ) ( Invitrogen ) on ice , as described previously ( del Pozo et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , cells were chilled on ice for 15 minutes , labeled with 1 m g / ml CTxB on ice for 15 minutes , washed twice with ice - cold PBS , and incubated with DMEM + 10 % FCS for 60 minutes . The cells were then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS . The localization of CTxB close to the coverslip , including the basal plasma membrane , was then visualized by confocal microscopy . The cells with CTxB at the cell periphery without significant CTxB accumulation at the cell center were considered as cells without CTxB incorporation . Electron microscopy Cells on plastic coverslips ( Thermanox , Nalge Nunc International ) were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde and 2 % glutaraldehyde for 5 minutes at room temperature . The cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % saponin and 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in Tris - buffered saline for 20 minutes . The cells were blocked overnight with 1 % BSA in Tris - buffered saline and then incubated with the anti - PACSIN2 antibody and a Nanogold rabbit Fab fragment ( Nanoprobes ) . The stained cells were postfixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline and blocked , and then the gold signal was enhanced by Goldenhance ( Nanoprobes ) . After the gold - enhancement reaction , the cells were washed , stained with 1 % osmium tetroxide and 1 % potassium ferrocyanide , washed , dehydrated in 50 % , 60 % , 70 % , 80 % , 90 % , 95 . 5 % and 100 % ethanol , placed in propylene oxide , and embedded in the epoxy resin Quetol - 812 , according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Nissin EM ) . After polymerization of the resin , 80 nm sections were prepared and counterstained for 10 minutes in uranyl acetate and for 2 minutes in lead citrate . Dried sections were examined by transmission electron microscopy . Plasma membrane sheets were prepared and observed as described previously ( Vinten et al . , 2001 ) , and were stained with an anti - PACSIN2 rabbit polyclonal antibody and an anti - caveolin - 1 ( 7C8 ) mouse monoclonal antibody , or an anti - caveolin - 1 rabbit monoclonal antibody and anti - dynamin - 2 mouse monoclonal antibody , followed by 5 - nm - or 10 - nm - gold - conjugated antibodies .
