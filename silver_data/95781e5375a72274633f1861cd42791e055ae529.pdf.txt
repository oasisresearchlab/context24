We report that (cid:1) 100 - nm clusters of (cid:1) 50 b 3 - activated integrins form very early adhesions under a wide variety of conditions on RGD surfaces . These adhesions form similarly on ﬂuid and rigid substrates , but most adhe - sions are transient on rigid substrates . Without talin or actin polymerization , few early adhesions form , but expression of either the talin head or rod domain in talin - depleted cells restores early adhesion forma - tion . Mutation of the integrin binding site in the talin rod decreases cluster size . We suggest that the integrin clusters constitute universal early adhesions and that they are the modular units of cell matrix adhesions . They require the association of activated integrins with cytoplasmic proteins , in particular talin and actin , and cytoskeletal contraction on them causes adhesion maturation for cell motility and growth . INTRODUCTION The growth and differentiation of cells depends upon the forma - tion of cell - matrix adhesions that are created through forces generated by the cytoskeleton and transmitted through integrin adhesions to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( Vogel and Sheetz , 2009 ) . These forces are developed in response to the ECM rigid - ity . Major cellular decisions , such as cell fate determination and durotaxis , are directly regulated by the matrix rigidity ( Calle et al . , 2006 ; Discher et al . , 2009 ; Engler et al . , 2006 ; Geiger and Ber - shadsky , 2001 ; Geiger et al . , 2009 ; Yu et al . , 2013 ) . However , matrix rigidity varies dramatically in the body , ranging from (cid:1) 1 kPa in brain to (cid:1) 500 kPa in bone , which raises the question of how does adhesion formation proceed on substrates of such diverse rigidities . Several recent studies support a multi - step model of adhesion assembly on rigid glass in which the ﬁrst step involves integrin clustering prior to force generation ( Choi et al . , 2008 ; Iskratsch et al . , 2014 ) . To better understand early ( nascent ) adhesions , we sought to determine the steps of adhe - sion formation on soft substrates and compare them to rigid substrates . We hypothesize that both the extracellular matrix forces and intracellular components play a role in the assembly of early ad - hesions . The earliest adhesions , known as nascent adhesions , may organize differently on matrices of different rigidity . Due to their diffraction limited size and short lifespan on rigid substrates , nascent adhesions have not been well studied . Image correlation spectroscopy was only recently employed to understand the stoichiometry of these adhesions ( Bachir et al . , 2014 ) . However , there is no reason to believe that early adhesions are similar on rigid versus soft surfaces , although it is clear that myosin contraction forces are not needed for nascent adhesion forma - tion ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , using quantitative super - reso - lution microscopy , we sought to depict and understand early adhesions under a variety of conditions . Our study aimed to distinguish between the biochemical signal contributed by in - tegrin - ligand binding or recruitment of adhesome components , versus mechanical signals contributed by substrate rigidity in the formation and organization of nascent adhesions . Adhesome components are recruited to nascent adhesions in response to ligand binding and aid in their maturation ( Caval - canti - Adam et al . , 2008 ; Jiang et al . , 2003 ; Schvartzman et al . , 2011 ; Alexandrova et al . , 2008 ; Choi et al . , 2008 ; Yu et al . , 2013 ) . It is not currently understood if adhesome components are required to form early adhesions , or whether they assemble by passive clustering of liganded integrin receptors . Key early molecules recruited to nascent adhesions include talin , paxilin , kindlin , and FAK ( Bachir et al . , 2014 ; Choi et al . , 2008 ; Yu et al . , 2011 ) . The formin FHOD1 was recently shown to play a critical role in organizing actin within early adhesions in lamellipo - dia , which subsequently catalyze cell motility ( Iskratsch et al . , 2013 ) . Because these early adhesions control later events that result in motility and / or cell viability , it is important to understand their formation and organization . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Quantitative Characterization of Nascent Adhesions To segregate the role of ligand binding versus the role of sub - strate rigidity during the formation of nascent adhesions , we presented the ECM ligand Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) to the cells in the absence of extracellular traction forces . This was achieved by presenting RGD to RPTP a + / + mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) on functionalized ﬂuid supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs ) ( Figure 1A ; Yu et al . , 2011 ) . Structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) revealed local increases in RGD intensity where early adhe - sions formed . These initial clusters grew in intensity for (cid:1) 3 min Developmental Cell 35 , 1 – 8 , December 7 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 1 Please cite this article in press as : Changede et al . , Nascent Integrin Adhesions Form on All Matrix Rigidities after Integrin Activation , Developmental Cell ( 2015 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . devcel . 2015 . 11 . 001 until reaching a plateau and then did not grow further even though the freely motile RGD ligand was present in abundance , indicating that early adhesion size was regulated ( Figures 1B and S1A , arrow showing individual clusters ) . Similar clusters were also observed with GFP - Paxillin using TIRF in SIM ( Figures S1B and S1E ) . Thus , we suggest that a basic adhesion complex initially formed in response to ligand binding . These basic adhe - sion units often aggregated to form larger adhesions but did not fuse ( Figure 1B ; Figures S1A and S1B ; Movie S1 ) , demonstrating a mechanism of building the adhesions from the early adhesion building blocks . Because these adhesions appeared to be constant in size , we employed photoactivated light microscopy ( PALM ) to measure their size at (cid:1) 10 nm resolution and estimate the number of integ - rins in them . To track the RGD ligands , we used Dylite - 650 , a novel PALM dye bound to Neutravidin ( see Supplemental Exper - imental Procedures for further characterization of the dye ) . Anal - ysis of the PALM images was performed with a custom - built maximum likelihood algorithm that identiﬁed individual ﬂuoro - phores ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . The algorithm was tested by applying Neutravidin dye to different dilutions of A B C D E Figure 1 .

When there was an average of 5 , 000 ; 1 , 000 ; or 500 molecules of biotin attached per square micrometer , the analysis identiﬁed an average of 5 , 000 ± 217 ; 1 , 023 ± 124 ; and 516 ± 111 avidin molecules / m m 2 ( mean ± SD ) , respectively ( Figure S1G ) . This demonstrated that the algorithm and method for quantifying the number of avidin molecules was valid over a wide range of avidin densities . Using this algorithm , we quantitatively analyzed the RGD clusters formed by MEFs on SLBs . The cells were allowed to spread for 15 min before ﬁxation because this was the time when most of the early adhesions plateaued in size ( Figures 1A and 1B ) and endocytosis was minimal ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) . Prior to analysis , the ﬁxed cells were extracted with detergent to remove any unbound ligand ( Figures S1C and S1D ) . This did not introduce any detectable artifacts ( Figures S2C and S2D ) . Upon PALM analysis of 7 , 533 adhesions in 12 cells , we determined that the average number of ligand molecules per adhesion was 52 ± 43 . The size of the adhe - sion was calculated from the full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) ﬂuorophore density and had a median value of 105 . 6 ± 17 . 4 nm ( Figure 1D ) . Density of these early adhesions was 2 . 8 / m m 2 of the cell area . There was only a small contribution from the back - ground level of unbound streptavidin molecules because the ﬂuorescence level outside the cells was measured to be 30 - to 70 - fold lower . To determine if the cluster size or number of integrins depended upon RGD density , we decreased RGD density in the bilayer by 3 - or 10 - fold ; however , dilution only caused a decrease in the density of early adhesions per square micro - meter , whereas size and number of ligands per cluster stayed 2 Developmental Cell 35 , 1 – 8 , December 7 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc .

To determine if these adhesions depended on integrin activation , cells were treated with MnCl 2 to lock the integrins in an active conformation ( Cluzel et al . , 2005 ) . Upon treatment with 0 . 5 mM Mn 2 + , the median number of integrins per adhesion increased by 50 % , yet the size of the adhesion did not increase signiﬁcantly ( Figure 3D ; Table 2 in Figure S2 ) , indicating that the basic clusters were restricted in size to (cid:1) 100 nm . These early adhesions were remarkably uniform in size although the density of integrins in these adhesions was relatively variable . These adhesions were not only restricted to MEFs , but HUVECs also showed very similar adhesions in terms of the number of integrin molecules , FWHM , and early adhesions per square micrometer ( Figure S1I ) . To determine the density of integrins within the adhesions , we used the measured number of integrins and the cluster diameter and that gave a median density of 6 , 600 integrins / m m 2 with a SD of 4 , 000 . Because our method of determining the number of dye molecules was estimated to be accurate to within < 10 % , the large SD was likely due to actual variation in the number of mole - cules within the adhesion . Using a conservative estimate of the footprint of the liganded integrin dimer at 40 nm 2 , the theoretical maximum density of the integrins was (cid:1) 25 , 000 integrins / m m 2 ( Xiong et al . , 2001 , 2002 ; Ye et al . , 2010 ) . Although the density that we observed in nascent adhesions was still less than the theoretical maximum , it was much greater than was estimated in focal adhesions ( Wiseman et al . , 2004 ) . That estimate was an averagevalueandfocaladhesionsappearedtobeacombination of low - density and high - density regions ( Rossier et al . , 2012 ) . Previous studies have shown a direct correspondence be - tween RGD clusters and integrin adhesions ( Yu et al . , 2011 ) . Still , it was important to test under these conditions , if integrins formed similar clusters as the RGD , and to further identify the actual integrin type present in the clusters . Because a v b 3 was the primary integrin for RGD ligands in MEFs , we imaged early adhesions of b 3mEOS2 - expressing MEFs , after knockdown of the endogenous b 3 using shRNA ( Figure S1H ) . After cells were spread on RGD - SLBs , simultaneous two - color PALM imaging revealed a very close proximity between the location of Neutra - vidin Dylite 650 - RGD and b 3 mEOS2 , indicating that RGD clus - tering corresponded to a v b 3 integrin clustering ( Figure 1E ) . The ratio of number of molecules per cluster measured by RGD compared to that measured by b 3 mEOS2 was 1 . 57 ± 0 . 51 . This difference was possibly explained from greater variability in the measurement of mEOS2 dye because it blinked more sto - chastically . Other parameters such as misfolded mEOS2 , and the presence of endogenous b 3 ( because the shRNA did not produce a complete knockout ) in these clusters were likely to contribute to this observation . Hence , measurements of b 3 levels were only relative , and Dylite - RGD provided a good estimate of b 3 clustering . Nascent Adhesion Formation of b 3 Integrin Does Not Depend upon Substrate Rigidity To determine whether the formation of early integrin adhesions depended on force , we spread b 3 mEOS2 - expressing MEFs ( after b 3 knockdown ) either on RGD - SLBs or RGD - glass ( Fig - ure 2A ) . Cells spread much further on glass than on the SLBs . Small adhesions formed in the cells on glass within lamellipodial extensions ( Figure 2A ) , similar to previous reports ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . Surprisingly , very similar adhesions formed on both SLBs and on glass ( (cid:1) 100 nm in size with (cid:1) 42 b 3 molecules , Ta - ble 2 in Figure S2 ) . To control for non - speciﬁc integrin binding and non - speciﬁc clustering of mEOS2 ( Annibale et al . , 2011 ) , cells were spread on poly - lysine coated glass . On this surface , fewer integrin clusters formed , and those observed had a signif - icantly smaller size ( less than half ) , with (cid:1) 5 - fold lower number of integrins ( Figure 2B ; Table S1 ) . Importantly , these sparse clusters formed non - speciﬁcally and did not preferentially localize to the lamellipodia ( Figure 2A ) . To avoid including these non - speciﬁc clusters in our measurements of ligand - dependent adhesions , a minimum threshold for cluster size was set at the diameter and number of integrins in clusters formed on poly - lysine substrates . These results demonstrated that ligand binding was necessary for integrin adhesion formation . How - ever , the early adhesion size was independent of the rigidity of the ligand - presenting substrate , strongly indicating that they were formed prior to mechanosensing of the substrate . As reported previously , a signiﬁcant fraction of nascent adhe - sions disassemble on glass ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) within a relatively short lifetime of about 2 min ( Movie S2 , average lifetime of disas - sembling adhesions 135 s ± 30 s ) , while the remaining adhesions matured over time . The early adhesions on SLBs were long - lived ( > 10 min , Movie S2 ) , indicating that the turnover of the adhesions was a second step that was stimulated by extracellular traction force . Although liganded integrins diffused on SLBs to the clusters , they were stationary on RGD - glass . Thus , early adhesions formed on RGD - glass recruited unliganded integrins , and either integrin - integrin or cytoplasmic adhesome protein - integrin interactions Figure 2 .

In earlier studies , it was found that individ - ual liganded integrins would diffuse in the plasma membrane but would rapidly attach to the cytoskeleton upon clustering ( Felsen - feld et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , ligand binding to integrins was much weaker back from the leading edge , which enabled integ - rins to diffuse to the early adhesions on glass surfaces and to assemble there ( Nishizaka et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , the nascent adhe - sions appeared to form as the result of a local activation process , followed by recruitment and assembly of components . A B C D E Figure 3 .

( E ) Box plots show cluster properties in Mn 2 + - treated cells . See also Figure S3 and Movie S3 . The fact that adhesion size was rela - tively uniform indicated that a cytoplasmic complex acted to stabilize activated in - tegrins in these early adhesions . In sup - port of this hypothesis , we found a very high variance in the number of integrins per cluster ( about 60 % of the median ) but not in the diameter of the clusters ( 15 % – 20 % of the median ) . Further evi - dence came from integrin activation by Mn 2 + ( Figure 3D ) because it signiﬁcantly increased the number of integrins per cluster while only causing a slight increase in diameter . This was consistent with the model that a scaffold of cytoplasmic proteins ( (cid:1) 100 nm in diameter ) formed around a smaller number of activated integrins , and then more integrins were recruited to the complex . In previous studies , a cluster of four RGD ligands in an area with a diameter of (cid:1) 100 nm was sufﬁcient to support normal cell spreading , and seven RGDs distributed in a similar area supported spreading even when clusters were separated by 400 nm ( Cavalcanti - Adam et al . , 2008 ; Schvartzman et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , if a cytoplasmic protein complex was able to form on a few liganded integrins , it could have recruited and activated more integrins . Talin Head or Rod Is Required for Formation of Early Adhesions Talin , a key adhesome component , was required for formation of focal adhesions ( FA ) on ﬁbronectin - coated substrates ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . Talin was also recruited to the early adhesions 4 Developmental Cell 35 , 1 – 8 , December 7 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc .

To test talin involvement in the formation of early adhesions , talin - depleted cells ( Figure S3A ; Movie S3 ) ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) were analyzed . Fewer ta - lin - depleted cells adhered to the SLBs and the ones that were able to adhere formed far fewer early adhesions ( Figure 3B ; Fig - ure S3A ) . Careful examination of the clusters in the talin - depleted cells revealed that some remaining Talin2 was associated with the clusters ( Figures S3C and S3D ) . This indicated that the few clusters observed in these cells were a result of the remaining Talin2 in these cells , demonstrating the important role of talin in formation of early adhesions . Talin dependence of cluster formation was also observed in endothelial cells . After depletion of talin as described in ( Liu et al . , 2015 ) < 10 % of HUVEC cells adhered to the RGD functionalized SLBs ( Figure S3B ) . The ones that adhered also showed very few clusters ( less than ten per cell , Figure S3B ) . Expression of GFP - Talin1 restored normal numbers of clusters in both MEFs and HUVECs ( Figure 3B ; Table S1 ; Figure S3B ) , showing a clear requirement for Talin1 in the formation of early adhesions . Talin functioned either as an activator of integrins or in the assembly / stabilization of early adhesions ( Critchley , 2009 ; Pinon et al . , 2014 ) . To differentiate between these functions , we bypassed the integrin activation function of talin by activating integrins with Mn 2 + . After Mn 2 + addition to talin - depleted cells , the median density of adhesions increased dramatically from 0 . 14 / m m 2 to 2 . 8 / m m 2 on the RGD - SLBs . There was a 2 - fold higher level in the cells with normal talin expression ( 5 . 8 / m m 2 ) and the number of integrins within the adhesions was greater in normal talin - expressing cells with Mn 2 + treatment ( Figure 3D ; Table S1 ) . However , these data indicated that integrin activation was the most important factor in assembly of early adhesions , although talin still had a signiﬁcant contribution . To further understand how talin was involved in early adhesion formation , we investigated the role of speciﬁc talin domains ( Fig - ure 3A ) . Talin is a large protein with a 44 KDa head domain and a 190 KDa rod domain ( Critchley , 2009 ) . The head domain of talin bound to the b - integrin tail and several other proteins including actin ( Cluzel et al . , 2005 ) . On RGD - SLBs , expression of the GFP labeled talin head in talin - depleted cells stimulated forma - tion of early adhesions with a near - normal size and a median density of 3 . 4 adhesions / m m 2 ( Figures 3A – 3C ; Table S1 ) . In the case of the talin rod , structural studies showed that the rod domain bound to b 3 integrin at the same site where a v bound to b 3 prior to activation , indicating that the talin rod domain bound only to activated b 3 ( Calderwood et al . , 2013 ; Gingras et al . , 2009 ; Moes et al . , 2007 ) . The rod domain bound to actin either directly or via vinculin . In addition , the rod was able to dimerize , which aided integrin clustering by allowing binding to at least two integrins simultaneously . Experimentally , the stoi - chiometric ratio of integrin : talin was reported to be 2 : 1 ( Bachir et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , GFP - talin rod domain expression in talin depleted cells rescued formation of early adhesions with a near - normal size and density ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Table S1 ) . However , when the IBS2 domain of the talin rod was mutated , it was not able to rescue talin depletion and resulted in a lower density of clusters compared to the talin - depleted cells ( Figure S3E ) . The size of the early adhesions was also reduced compared to those with talin , suggesting a strong dependence of early adhesion formation on talin . Thus , talin rod appeared to be involved in cluster formation through inter - action with integrin . Early Adhesions Formed by Either Talin Head or Rod Domain Interact Differently with Actin Talin can bind actin at various sites ( Figure 4A ) . This prompted us to test the effect of actin polymerization on early adhesion formation , and we found that far fewer adhesions formed after Latrunculin A treatment ( Figures S4A and S4B ; Table S1 ) , similar to talin - depleted cells . However , after myosin inhibition by bleb - bistatin treatment , early adhesions formed which were normal in size and density . This provided further evidence that cellular forces were not required to form the initial adhesions ( Figures S4A and S4B ; Table S1 ) ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , actin polymer - ization aided early adhesion formation , prior to force being es - tablished at these adhesions . Although both the talin head and rod domains restored early adhesions of a similar size and density in talin - depleted cells , analysis of early adhesion motility on RGD lipid bilayers indicated that the interaction with actin was different . Time - lapse videos of the clusters on RGD - SLBs with full - length talin showed that the adhesions were independently motile ( Figures 4A and 4B ; Movie S1 ; Figure S4D ) , as reported previously ( Figure 1 ) , ( Yu et al . , 2011 ) . With expression of the talin head domain in talin - depleted cells , they moved in a similar fashion as observed in the cells ex - pressing full - length talin ( Figures 4A and 4B ; Movie S1 ; Figures S4D and S4E ) . However , after expression of the talin rod domain in talin - depleted cells , the adhesion clusters showed reduced average speed of motility and the movement was primarily directed toward cluster aggregation ( Figures 4A and 4B ; Movie S1 ; Figures S4D and S4E ) . Thus , the head domain of talin ap - peared to be responsible for the motility observed with expres - sion of both the full - length talin and the head domain . It was possible that the actin organization around the early ad - hesions was different depending on the expression of the rod versus the head domain . In cells expressing full - length talin , the formin FHOD1 was needed for the early polymerization of actin from integrin clusters ( Iskratsch et al . , 2013 ) . To observe if FHOD1 was recruited to early adhesions depending on speciﬁc talin domain expression , we immunolabeled these cells with an anti - FHOD1 antibody . In line with previous results in MEFs using full - length talin , only a fraction of the early adhesions showed localization with FHOD1 at any given time ( Figure 4C ; Pearson’s coefﬁcient = 0 . 55 ± 0 . 07 ) ( Iskratsch et al . , 2013 ) . The early adhe - sions formed by expression of the talin head domain showed higher colocalization with FHOD1 ( Figure 4C ; Pearson’s coefﬁ - cient = 0 . 73 ± 0 . 09 ) . However , the ones formed after expression of the talin rod domain did not colocalize with FHOD1 ( Figure 4C ; Pearson’s coefﬁcient = 0 . 27 ± 0 . 1 ) . To further establish that the movement of talin head and full - length clusters was dependent upon FHOD1 , we knocked down FHOD1 and found these clus - ters ( with endogenous talin full - length ) moved with reduced speed and primarily aggregated , similar to the clusters formed upon expression of the GFP - Talin Rod domain ( Figures 4A and 4B ; Figures S4F – S4H ) . Thus , the movements of the clusters formed upon talin head and full - length expression not only corre - lated with the localization of FHOD1 to the clusters but also depletion of FHOD1 promoted aggregation of the clusters and reduced the speed of motility of the clusters .

Aggregation could depend on actin aggregation through crosslinkers , since the talinroddomain bound directly to actin . On the other hand , the movements of the full - length talin clusters required myosin activity ( Yu et al . , 2011 ) . Clusters recruited active Src kinase ( SFK ) and FHOD1 was re - cruitedtotheclustersbySrckinasetoinduceactinpolymerization from the clusters . Myosin then pulled upon the actin ﬁlaments from adjacent clusters and if force was created , then the cells actively spread on the substrate ( Yu et al . , 2011 ) and developed a normal actin ﬂow ( Iskratsch et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , recruitment of FHOD1 to early adhesions inﬂuenced adhesion mobility but not size , which was consistent with earlier ﬁndings that FHOD1 was important for subsequent adhesion development ( Iskratsch et al . , 2013 ) but not for early cluster formation . Thus , we suggest that , the ﬁrst step of formation of the nascent adhesions is clus - tering of ligand - activated integrins that requires Talin function . Subsequent steps will cause adhesion maturation in a force - dependent process . This study focuses on formation of early adhesions and is able to segregate the biochemical integrin ligand interaction from the biomechanical traction force provided by the ECM . We ﬁnd that , early adhesions assemble as a ﬁrst response to integrin - ligand A C B Figure 4 . Clusters Formed with Talin Head and Rod Domain Show Different Motility , which Could Depend on FHOD1 ( A ) Differential motility of the clusters formed by Talin head or rod domain . Expression of GFP - Talin and GFP - Talin head domain in talin - depleted cells restores cluster formation and motility of individual clusters . However , clusters formed after expression of GFP - Talin rod domain show reduced motility . Interestingly , cluster motility was primarily directed toward other clusters , where they merge to form larger aggregates , similar to FHOD1 knockdown clusters . ( B ) The mean square displacement was measured for all the conditions and the MSD coefﬁcient ( a ) was calculated from ﬁtting an anomalous diffusion model to MSD / D t ( square micrometers per second ) plots from tracks of RGD clusters . Either average or relative fraction of a was plotted where a < 0 . 95 subdiffusive , 0 . 95 – 1 . 05 diffusive , and > 1 . 1 is super - diffusive .

Quantitative super resolution microscopy reveals that the nascent adhesion clusters have a remarkably consistent size and density under a range of different conditions including ﬂuid versus immobile ligands , varying ligand densities and cytoskeleton inhibitors . Previous studies have shown that early adhesions did not grow beyond a certain size as measured by their ﬂuorescence intensity but were unable to deﬁne that size ( Yu et al . , 2011 ; Geiger and Yamada , 2011 ; Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Riveline et al . , 2001 ; Tamariz and Grinnell , 2002 ; Vice - nte - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) . Very similar early adhesions are formed on substrates varying vastly in rigidity , further empha - sizing that this is a force independent process ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , we suggest that there is a universal modular unit formed in early cell matrix adhesions . Although these units do not depend on force , their formation requires intracellular adhesome components . In particular , their assembly and size strongly depends on talin , an important mechanosensor . This shows an important novel function of talin in formation of early adhesions prior to its stretching in response to force . This could also help explain the rapid recruitment of talin to the nascent adhesions on SLBs ( Bachir et al . , 2014 ; Yu et al . , 2011 ) . Once these similar adhesions form on different substrates , the cells try to develop force on the matrix through the adhesions . If force is developed , then either the cell spreads further or there is activation of rigidity sensing . Also , force modiﬁes the lifetime of these adhesions in that the majority of nascent adhesions on glass , unlike ﬂuid substrates , turn over rapidly ( within (cid:1) 3 min ) , whereas some mature to form focal adhesions . Furthermore , we see that larger adhesion complexes are typically composed of many individual clusters connected by lower levels of integrin ﬂuorescence between the clusters . This is consistent with recent observations of integrin diffusion in adhesions , indicating that micrometer - sized adhesions have regions of lower integrin den - sity that allow lateral diffusion of integrins ( Rossier et al . , 2012 ) . There is considerable evidence that nascent adhesions consti - tute general precursors to cell - ECM adhesions and are laid down as the ﬁrst response to the ECM . The clusters of integrins would enable strong binding of the cell to RGD ligands to support high matrix forces . In conclusion , the size of nascent adhesions is robust to changes in ligand rigidity , or actin polymerization , indicating that there is an initial mechanism of seeding integrin mediated adhesions on substrates irrespective of rigidity . Talin is associ - ated with early adhesions but either the head or the rod can support adhesion formation if there is an integrin binding site . Thus , we suggest that early adhesions are composed of basic integrin clusters of (cid:1) 100 nm in diameter with about 50 integrins , and form modular links to ECM substrates prior to rigidity sensing , in a process initiated by integrin - ligand binding and aided by talin function . Subsequent modiﬁcations for adhesion maturation could build upon these modules , enabling the cell to maintain a strong attachment to the matrix while adding more functions that would report on the properties of the matrix . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Additional information on reconstruction of PALM images and data analysis is available in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures .
