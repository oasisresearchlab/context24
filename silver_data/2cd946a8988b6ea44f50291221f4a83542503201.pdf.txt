In addition to glycolytic enzyme and plasminogen receptor functions , α - Enolase appears to have other cellular functions and subcellular localizations that are distinct from its well - established function in glycolysis . Furthermore , di ﬀ erential expression of α - enolase has been related to several pathologies , such as cancer , Alzheimer’s disease , and rheumatoid arthritis , among others . We have identiﬁed α - enolase as a plasminogen receptor in several cell types . In particular , we have analyzed its role in myogenesis , as an example of extracellular remodelling process . We have shown that α - enolase is expressed on the cell surface of di ﬀ erentiating myocytes , and that inhibitors of α - enolase / plasminogen binding block myogenic fusion in vitro and skeletal muscle regeneration in mice . α - Enolase could be considered as a marker of pathological stress in a high number of diseases , performing several of its multiple functions , mainly as plasminogen receptor . This paper is focused on the multiple roles of the α - enolase / plasminogen axis , related to several pathologies . 1 . Introduction Enolase , also known as phosphopyruvate hydratase , was discovered in 1934 by Lohman and Mayerhof . It is one of the most abundantly expressed cytosolic proteins in many organisms . It is a key glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the dehydratation of 2 - phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyru - vate , in the last steps of the catabolic glycolytic pathway [ 1 ] ( Figure 1 ) . It is a metalloenzyme that requires the metal ion magnesium ( Mg 2 + ) to be catalytically active . Enolase is found from archaebacteria to mammals , and its sequence is highly conserved [ 2 ] . In vertebrates , the enzyme occurs as three isoforms : α - enolase ( Eno1 ) is found in almost all human tissues , whereas β - enolase ( Eno3 ) is predominantly found in muscle tissues , and γ - enolase ( Eno2 ) is only found in neuron and neuroendocrine tissues [ 3 ] . The three enolase isoforms share high - sequence identity and kinetic properties [ 4 – 6 ] . Enzymatically active enolase which exists in a dimeric ( homo - or heterodimers ) form is composed of two subunits facing each other in an antiparallel fashion [ 6 , 7 ] . The crystal structure of enolase from yeast and human has been determined and catalytic mechanisms have been proposed [ 8 – 10 ] . Although it is expressed in most of the cells , the gene that encodes enolase is not considered a housekeeping gene since its expression varies according to the pathophysiological , metabolic , or developmental conditions of cells [ 11 ] . α - Enolase mRNA translation which is primarily under devel - opmental control is signiﬁcantly upregulated during cellular growth and practically undetectable during quiescent phases [ 12 , 13 ] . Recent accumulation of evidence revealed that , in addi - tion to its innate glycolytic function , α - enolase plays an important role in several biological and pathophysiological processes : by using an alternative stop codon , the α - enolase mRNA can be translated into a 37 kDa protein which lacks 2 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology Glucose - 6 - P Fructose - 6 - P ATP ADP Glycolysis Glucose Glucose 6 P Fructose 6 P Hexokinas isomerase ATP ADP P - fructokinase Fructose - 1 , 6 - diP Dihydroxyacetone - P ADP kinase Aldolase Triose - P - isomerase Glyceraldehyde 1 , 3 - diP - glycerate Glyceraldehyde - 3 - P - P - dehydrogenase NAD + NADH ATP ADP P - glyceratekinase 3 - P - glycerate ADP 2 - P - glycerate P - glyceratemutase Enolase P - enol - pyruvate ADP Pyruvateki α - ENO Eno 1 Nonneuronalenolase ( NNE ) γ - ENO Eno 2 Neuronal - speciﬁc enolase ( NSE ) Pyruvate ATP kinase β - ENO Eno 3 Muscular - speciﬁc enolase ( MSE ) P - glucose Figure 1 : Summary of glycolytic metabolic pathway .

Enolase Plasmin ( ogen ) Glycolyticenzymes α - enolase DNA Membrane proteins Microtubules Figure 2 : Interaction of α - enolase with other nuclear , cytoplasmic , or membrane molecules . α - Enolase can directly interact with other enolase isoforms ( α , β , and γ ) to form enzymatically active dimers , other glycolytic enzymes as pyruvate kinase , phosphoglycerate mutase and aldolase . It can also bind to microtubules network proteins , as F - actin and tubulin , and it is localized on the cell surface , interacting with other membrane proteins , where it binds to plasminogen and plasmin . the ﬁrst 96 amino acid residues . This protein , named c - myc promoter - binding protein 1 ( MBP - 1 ) is localized in the nucleus and can bind to the c - myc P2 promoter and negatively regulates transcription of the protooncogene [ 14 ] . α - Enolase has been detected on the surface of hematopoietic cells such as monocytes , T cells and B cells , neuronal cells , and endothelial cells as a strong plasminogen receptor , modulating pericellular ﬁbrinolytic activity . The expression of α - enolase on the surface of a variety of eukaryotic cells has been found to be dependent on the pathophysiological conditions of these cells [ 15 – 19 ] . α - Enolase has also been described as a neurotrophic factor [ 20 ] , a heat - shock protein ( HSP48 ) [ 21 ] , and a hypoxic stress protein [ 22 ] . Furthermore , α - enolase is part of the crystallin lens of vertebrates [ 23 ] , binds to fragments of F - actin and tubulin [ 24 ] , and has been detected associated to centrosomes in HeLa cells [ 25 ] . α - Enolase also binds with high a ﬃ nity to other glycolytic enzymes : pyruvate kinase , phosphoglycerate mutase , which are adjacent to enolase in the glycolytic pathway , and to aldolase , which is known to associate with cytoskeletal proteins [ 26 ] ( Figure 2 ) . It has also been suggested that upregulation of α - enolase contributes to hypoxia tolerance through nonglycolytic mechanisms [ 27 ] . Increased expression of α - enolase has been reported to correlate with progression of tumors , neuroblastoma , and lung cancer , and enolase has been considered to be a potential diagnostic markers for many tumors [ 28 – 32 ] . Thus , α - enolase appears to be a “moonlighting protein , ” one of a growing list of proteins that are recognized as iden - tical gene products exhibiting multiple functions at distinct cellular sites through “gene sharing” [ 33 , 34 ] . This paper is focused on the multiple roles of the α - enolase / plasminogen axis , related to several pathologies . 2 . The Plasminogen Activation System In multicellular organisms , extracellular proteolysis is impor - tant to many biological processes involving a dynamic rearrangement of cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions , being the plasminogen activation ( PA ) system among the most important extracellular proteases . The PA system comprises an inactive proenzyme , plasminogen , and ubiquitous in body ﬂuid , that can be converted into the active enzyme , plasmin , by two physiological activators ( PAs ) : tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) and urokinase - type plasmino - gen activator ( uPA ) . Inhibition of the plasminogen sys - tem occurs at the level of the PA , by speciﬁc inhibitors ( PAI - 1 and PAI - 2 ) , or at the level of plasmin , by α 2 - antiplasmin ( reviewed in [ 35 ] ) . The PA / plasmin system is a key regulator in extracellular matrix ( ECM ) remodeling directly by its ability to degrade ECM components , such as laminin or ﬁbronectin , and indirectly via activation of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , which will degrade collagen ( s ) subsequently . Furthermore , plasmin is able to activate latent growth factors , such as transforming growth factor β ( TGF β ) and basic ﬁbroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) ( reviewed in [ 35 ] ) . Work from numerous groups has clearly demonstrated that the localization of plasminogen and its activators uPA and tPA on the cell surface , though association to speciﬁc cell membrane receptors , provides a mechanism for cells to harness and regulate the activities of these proteases [ 36 , 37 ] . Binding sites for plasminogen , tPA , and uPA have been identiﬁed on a variety of cell types , including monocytes , ﬁbroblasts , and endothelial cells [ 38 , 39 ] . uPA is recruited Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 3 α 2 - AP MigrationInvasion ECM degradation proMMPs Plg uPAR proGF Pli α - enolase Cell signaling ProliferationMigrationDifferentiation MMPs GF uPA α - enolase Figure 3 : Schematic overview represents α - enolase / plasminogen interaction on the cell surface . α - Enolase enhances plasminogen activation on the cell surface , concentrates plasmin proteolytic activity on the pericellular area and protects plasmin from its inhibitor α 2 - antiplasmin . Once activated , plasmin can degrade most of the components of the extracellular matrix , directly or indirectly by activating metalloproteases . It is also capable to activate prohormones of progrowing factors .

Described binding sites for plasminogen include α - enolase [ 18 , 42 ] , annexin A2 [ 43 ] , p11 [ 44 ] , histone H2B [ 45 , 46 ] , actin [ 47 ] , gp330 [ 48 ] , cytokeratin 8 [ 49 ] , histidine - proline rich glycoprotein [ 50 ] , glyceraldehide - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase [ 51 ] gangliosides [ 18 ] , and Plg - R TK [ 52 ] . α - Enolase and most of these proteins have C - terminal lysines predominantly responsible for plasminogen binding / activation [ 53 ] . Notably , most of these proteins have other described functions than plasminogen receptors , and lack a transmembrane domain , Plg - R TK being an exception , as it is a transmembrane receptor [ 52 ] . 3 . α - Enolase as a Plasminogen Receptor We and others have previously identiﬁed α - enolase as a plasminogen receptor on the surfaces of several diverse cell types including carcinoma cells [ 42 ] , monocytoid cells [ 15 , 18 ] , leukocytic cell lines [ 54 ] , rat neuronal cells [ 16 ] , and pathogenic streptococci [ 1 ] . On the cell surface , interaction of plasminogen with α - enolase enhances its activation by PAs , concentrates pro - tease activity pericellularly [ 55 – 57 ] , and protects plasmin from inhibition by α 2 - antiplasmin [ 18 , 58 ] ( Figure 3 ) . In order to examine the role of α - enolase in the pericellular generation of plasmin activity , we produced a monoclonal antibody , MAb11G1 , that speciﬁcally blocked plasminogen binding to puriﬁed α - enolase [ 54 ] . MAb11G1 allowed us to demonstrate that α - enolase occupancy by plasminogen on leukocytoid cells and on peripheral blood neutrophils is required for pericellular plasminogen activation and plasmin generation [ 54 ] . Considering the extraordinarily high number of plas - minogen binding sites / cells that have been described in di ﬀ erent cell types , no single surface protein can account for all plasminogen binding sites , suggesting that di ﬀ erent receptors coexist on the cell surface [ 18 ] . Evidence from monocytoid cells suggested that α - enolase was only one of several plasminogen receptors and its contribution to plasmin activation was only modest [ 18 , 54 ] . Posterior studies have emphasized the role of annexin A2 and histone H2B as plasminogen receptors in the same cells [ 46 ] , suggesting a minor contribution of α - enolase as plasminogen receptor . In more recent studies , the role of α - enolase has been resurrected , showing a central role for α - enolase in monocyte recruitment in inﬂammatory lung disease [ 59 ] . These results imply that di ﬀ erent plasminogen receptors could be targeted to regulate inﬂammatory cell recruitment in a temporal - speciﬁc manner . The α - enolase - plasminogen interaction is mediated by binding of plasminogen kringle domains to the C - terminal residues of α - enolase ( K 434 ) [ 15 , 18 ] . Furthermore , inter - action of plasminogen lysine binding sites with α - enolase depends upon recognition of C - terminal lysines K 420 , K 422 , 4 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology and K 434 , suggesting that amino acid residues upstream and / or secondary structure may be responsible for the high a ﬃ nity of α - enolase for plasminogen [ 15 , 18 ] . Another putative plasminogen - binding motif has been proposed in view of its crystal structure at position , 250 FFRSGKY 256 , that remains exposed when α - enolase forms a dimer , necessary for its glycolytic activity [ 10 ] . Human α - enolase structure has been determined and it has been found that it exhibits speciﬁc surface properties that are distinct from those of other enolases despite high - sequence similarity . These dif - ferences in structure explain its various activities , including plasmin ( ogen ) and DNA binding [ 10 ] . The mechanism by which α - enolase , that lacks a signal sequence , is associated with the cell membrane remains unknown . Some authors have speculated that a hydrophobic domain within α - enolase might serve as an internal signal sequence [ 60 ] , while others suggest that posttranslational acetylation [ 61 ] or phosphorylation [ 62 ] may control mem - brane association . Nevertheless , α - enolase forms part of a growing list of proteins that lack signal sequences , but are transported to the cell surface by a yet unknown mechanism . 4 . α - Enolase in Myogenesis and Muscle Regeneration Proteolysis associated with the cell surface is a usual mech - anism in several physiological processes involving tissue remodeling . Myogenesis is an example of tissue remodeling in which massive extracellular matrix degradation takes place . Components of the PA system play important , yet distinct roles in muscle regeneration after injury . Using genetically modiﬁed mice for uPA and plasminogen , we and others have shown that loss of uPA - mediated plasmin activity blunts muscle repair in vivo [ 63 – 66 ] . In contrast , a negative role for PAI - 1 in muscle regeneration was suggested [ 65 ] . The PA system has also been shown to have an increasingly important role in muscular dystrophies . For example , greater expression of uPA has been found in mdx muscle , the mouse model for Duchenne muscle dystrophy ( DMD ) . Conversely , genetic loss of uPA exacerbated dystrophy and reduced muscle function in mdx mice [ 66 ] . Satellite cells derived from human DMD patients produce more uPAR and PAI - 1 and less uPA than normal satellite cells [ 67 ] . uPA and plasmin appear to be required for inﬁltration of macrophages into the damaged or dystrophic muscle in mdx mice . However , an interesting observation underpinning these results was that genetic loss of the uPAR in mdx mice failed to exacerbate muscular dystrophy , suggesting that uPA exerts its proteolytic e ﬀ ects independently of its cell surface receptor uPAR [ 66 ] . β - enolase is considered the speciﬁc muscular enolase iso - form , it is expressed in proliferating adult myoblasts as well as in di ﬀ erentiated myotubes [ 68 ] . It is upregulated in muscle during embryogenic development and it is considered an early marker of myogenesis [ 69 ] . The increase of the β - isoform is accompanied by a decrease of the α and γ isoform ; the γ - isoform is completely absent in the adult muscle , but the expression of the α - isoform is maintained in the adult muscle and in muscular cells [ 70 , 71 ] . Furthermore , we have described that α - enolase is upregulated in murine myoblasts C2C12 di ﬀ erentiation in vitro and in muscle regeneration in vivo [ 72 ] , thus raising the question of whether plasminogen receptors may also function in myogenesis and skeletal regeneration as a mechanism for regulating plasmin activity . We have investigated the role of α - enolase plasminogen receptor in muscle regeneration after injury , a process involving extensive cell inﬁltration and ECM remodeling . Injured wild - type mice and dystrophic mdx mice were treated with inhibitors of α - enolase / plasminogen binding : MAb11G1 ( an inhibitory monoclonal antibody against α - enolase ) and ε - aminocaproic acid ( EACA , a lysine ana - logue ) . These treatments had negative impacts on muscle repair by impairing adequate inﬂammatory cell inﬁltra - tion and promoting extracellular matrix deposition , which resulted in persistent degeneration . Furthermore , satellite cell - derived myoblasts ( i . e . , MPCs ) expressed α - enolase on the cell surface , and this expression was upregulated during myogenic di ﬀ erentiation , correlating with an increase of plasminogen binding to the cell surface . We found that both MAb11G1 and EACA treatments impaired satellite cell - derived myoblasts functions in vitro in agreement with blunted growth of new myoﬁbers in vivo ( Diaz - Ramos et al . , unpublished results ) . Loss of uPAR in vivo did not a ﬀ ect the degenera - tion / regeneration process ; in addition , cultured myoblasts from uPAR - deﬁcient mice showed e ﬃ cient myoblast dif - ferentiation and fusion [ 66 , 73 ] , indicating that uPAR is dispensable for e ﬃ cient muscle repair . This reinforces the idea that α - enolase is the main functional plasminogen receptor during muscle tissue remodeling . Altogether , these results demonstrate the novel requirement of α - enolase for restoring homeostasis of injured muscle tissue , by concen - trating plasmin activity on the cell surface of inﬂammatory and myogenic cells . 5 . The α - Enolase Expression in Injured Cardiac Muscle The actuation of the PA system in tissue healing after a cardiac failure , driving the degradation the ECM and scar tissue after an ischemic injury and allowing the inﬂammatory cell invasion , has been extensively demonstrated . The regulation of α - enolase in cardiac tissue as regulator of glucose metabolism has been analyzed by several authors . A decrease of α - enolase expression in the aging heart of old male monkeys has been described , paralleling left ventricular dysfunction , and could be involved in the mechanism for the cardiomyopathy of aging [ 74 ] . α - Enolase expression has been identiﬁed as a strongly induced factor in response to ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation in rat hearts sub - jected to ischemia - reperfusion [ 75 ] . Furthermore , α - Enolase improved the contractility of cardiomyocytes impaired by ischemic hypoxia [ 76 ] . α - Enolase has also been proposed as a marker for early diagnosis for acute myocardial infarction [ 77 ] . On the other hand , recent evidences indicates an involve - ment of proteinases , including the PAs and MMPs sys - tems , in the process of extracellular matrix degradation Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 5 and cell migration during cardiac wound healing [ 78 ] . In a recent study , Heymans et al . demonstrated that uPA - deﬁcient mice showed impaired infarct healing and were completely protected against cardiac rupture after induction of a myocardial infarction [ 79 ] . Wound healing after infarct was abolished in plasminogen - deﬁcient mice , indicating that the plasminogen system is required for the repair process of the heart after infarction . In the absence of plasmino - gen , inﬂammatory cells did not migrate into the infarcted myocardium , necrotic cardiomyocytes were not removed and there was no formation of granulation tissue and ﬁbrous tissue [ 80 ] . Furthermore , PAI - 1 , which has been shown to be expressed in mammalian cardiomyocytes [ 81 ] , has been implicated in the process of the cardiac remodeling by inhibiting activation of MMPs as well as plasmin generation . A dramatic induction of PAI - 1 in a mouse model of infarct has been described [ 82 ] . Experiments using mice deﬁcient in PAI - 1 suggest that increased expression of cardiac PAI - 1 may contribute to the development of ﬁbrous change after acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . In vivo studies also showed that PAI - 1 expression was induced in hearts under pathological conditions as ventricular hypertrophy [ 83 ] . All these results demonstrate that the PA system plays a role in ECM remodeling after a cardiac injury and allows inﬂammatory cell invasion . Furthermore , it can also play a role in cardiomyocyte survival . Cardiomyocytes , which are terminally di ﬀ erentiated cells , cannot proliferate , even when they are damaged ; the damage can lead to cell death in the case of serious diseases such as acute myocardial infarction and myocarditis [ 84 ] . Recent studies have identiﬁed myocyte apoptosis in the failing human heart [ 85 , 86 ] . Plasminogen could also drive cardiomyocyte apoptosis , because plasmin induces cell detachment and apoptosis of smooth muscle cells through its binding to the cell surface , although the receptor responsable for plasminogen binding has not yet been identiﬁed [ 87 ] . Knowing that the PA system has been associated with cardiac remodeling , and that α - enolase is upregulated in cardiac infarction , it is tempting to speculate that α - enolase could act as plasminogen receptor , regulating PA activity on cardiac cells . Previous results from our laboratory have shown that plasmin activity is concentrated on the cell surface of cardiac ﬁbroblasts in a lysine - dependent manner , and this binding capacity is increased by hypoxic conditions . Furthermore , plasminogen binding drives the activation of ﬁbroblasts to myoﬁbroblasts , the main cells responsible of tissue remodeling after a cardiac injury ( Garcia - Melero et al . , unpublished results ) . 6 . α - Enolase / Plasmin Role in Apoptosis It has been described that plasminogen binding to the cell surface and its further activation to plasmin induces cell detachment and apoptosis in smooth muscle cells , neurons and vascular myoﬁbroblasts [ 88 – 90 ] , although the molecular responsible for plasminogen interaction with the cell surface has not been identiﬁed . Externalization of glycolytic enzymes is a common and early aspect of cell death in di ﬀ erent cell types triggered to die with di ﬀ erent suicidal stimuli [ 91 ] . Apoptotic cells are recognized by phagocytes and trigger an active immuno - suppressive response . The lack of inﬂammation associated normally with the clearance of apoptotic cells has been linked to inﬂammatory and autoimmune disease as systemic lupus erythematosis and rheumatic diseases [ 92 – 95 ] . Regarding apoptotic cell surface proteins , a new concept has been deﬁned , SUPER , referring to Surface - exposed ( during apop - totic cell death ) , Ubiquitously expressed , Protease sensitive , Evolutionary - conserved , and Resident normally in viable cells ( SUPER ) , to emphasize deﬁning properties of apoptotic determinants for recognition and immune modulation . Ucker et al . have recently demonstrated that almost all members of the glycolytic pathway are enriched among apoptotic cell membranes , with α - enolase being the more abundant enzyme in the cell membrane , and considered the most paradigmatic SUPER protein [ 91 ] . In the cell membrane of apoptotic cells , α - enolase has lost its glycolytic activity , but it acts as plasminogen receptor , coinciding with the description of the association of plasminogen binding with apoptotic cell death [ 96 ] . In contrast to α - enolase , other molecular plasminogen receptors as annexin A2 [ 97 ] or H2B [ 46 ] , were not preferentially enriched on the apoptotic cell surface . 7 . α - Enolase in Cancer Several reports have shown an upregulation of α - enolase in several types of cancer [ 98 – 100 ] . The role of α - enolase as a plasminogen receptor on cancer cells has been extensively documented , where it acts as a key protein , promoting cellular metabolism in anaerobic conditions , and driving tumor invasion through plasminogen activation and ECM degradation ( reviewed in [ 101 ] ) . Recently , an analysis of disease - speciﬁc gene network identiﬁed desmin , interleukin 8 , and α - enolase as central elements for colon cancer tumorogenesis [ 102 ] . Knockdown of α - enolase expression in di ﬀ erent tumor cell lines caused a dramatic increase in their sensitivity to microtubule targeted drugs ( e . g . , taxanes and vincristine ) , probably due to α - enolase - tubulin interactions [ 103 ] , suggesting a role for α - enolase in modulating the microtubule network . Downreg - ulation of α - enolase gene product deceased invasiveness of the follicular thyroid carcinoma cell lines [ 104 ] . α - Enolase overexpression has been associated with head and neck cancer cells , and this increase associated not only with cancer progression but also with poor clinical outcomes . Furthermore , exogenous α - enolase expression promoted cell proliferation , migration , invasion , and tumorogenesis [ 105 ] . During tumor formation and expansion , tumor cells must increase glucose metabolism [ 106 ] . Hypoxia is com - mon feature of solid tumors . Consistent with this , overex - pression of glycolytic genes has been found in a myriad of human cancers [ 107 ] . In tumor cells , α - enolase is upregu - lated and supports anaerobic proliferation ( Warburg e ﬀ ect ) , and it is expressed on the cell surface , where it promotes cancer invasion . Thus , it seems that α - enolase is playing a pleitropic role on cancer cell progression . Furthermore , it has been demonstrated that α - enolase is upregulated 6 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma , where it is subjected to a array of posttranslational modiﬁcations , namely acety - lation , methylation , and phosphorylation [ 108 ] . Both , α - enolase expression and posttranslational modiﬁcations could be of diagnostic and prognostic value in cancer ( reviewed in [ 101 ] ) . 8 . Posttranslational Modiﬁcations of α - Enolase Posttranslational protein modiﬁcations , such as phosphory - lation , acetylation , and methylation are common and impor - tant mechanisms of acute and reversible regulation of protein function in mammalian cells , and largely control cellular signaling events that orchestrate biological functions . Several posttranslational modiﬁcations have been described for α - enolase . α - Enolase phosphorylation has been associated with pancreatic cancer , and induces speciﬁc autoantibody production in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients with diagnostic value [ 109 ] . Lysine acetylated α - enolase has been detected in mouse brain [ 110 ] . Nitration of tyrosine residues in α - enolase has been detected in diabetic rat hearts , contributing to the impaired glycolytic activity in diabetic cardiomyopathy [ 111 ] . Phosphorylated α - enolase has been detected in gastrocnemious muscle , and phosphorylation decreased with age [ 112 ] . Furthermore , carbonylation of α - enolase has been detected on human myoblasts under oxidative stress [ 113 ] . It remains to be determined how the posttranslational modiﬁcations of α - enolase can a ﬀ ect its catalytic activity , localization of the cell , protein stability , and the ability to dimerize or form a complex with other molecules . Investigations of these modiﬁcations patterns in di ﬀ erent pathologies will provide insights into its important role in pathophysiological processes . 9 . α - Enolase in Rheumatoid Arthritis The overexpression of α - enolase has also been found associated with chronic autoimmune diseases like rheuma - toid arthritis [ 19 , 114 ] , systemic sclerosis [ 115 ] , and pri - mary nephropathies [ 116 ] . Autoantibodies to α - enolase , are present in the sera of patients with very early rheumatoid arthritis and have potential diagnostic and prognostic value [ 117 ] . Recently , citrullinated proteins have been considered the main autoantigen of rheumatoid arhritis . Citrullination , also termed deimination , is a modiﬁcation of arginine side chains catalyzed by peptidylarginine deaminase . This posttranscriptional modiﬁcation has the potential to alter the structure , antigenicity , and function of proteins . α - Enolase is abundantly expressed in the sinovial membrane , and antibodies against citrullinated α - enolase were speciﬁc for rheumatoid arthritis . Citrullination changes the confor - mation of α - enolase and interferes with the noncovalent interaction involved in the formation of the enolase dimer , then results in an altered glycolytic activity and plasminogen binding . It is likely that citrullination of cell - surface α - enolase abrogates its plasminogen binding and activat - ing function and contributes to the decreased ﬁbrinolysis observed in rheumatoid arthritis [ 118 ] . Curiously , other glycolytic enzymes such as glucose phosphate isomerase and aldolase also promote rheumatoid arthritis autoimmunity by acting as autoantigens [ 119 ] . 10 . α - Enolase in Alzheimer’s Disease Although γ - enolase is the speciﬁc neuronal enolase isoform , α - isoform is also present in neurological tissues . Plasmin for - mation enhanced by α - enolase has been proposed to enhance neuritogenesis [ 16 , 120 ] . Furthermore , cathepsin X cleavage of C - terminal lysine of α - enolase impaired survival and neuritogenesis of neuronal cells [ 121 ] . α - Enolase has been reported as a strong plasminogen receptor within the brain ; it is known to be upregulated in the Alzheimer’s disease brain and has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target for this disease ( reviewed in [ 122 ] ) . Glucose hypometabolism and upregulation of glycolytic enzymes is a predominant feature in Alzheimer’s disease [ 123 ] , but accumulating results suggest that α - enolase may have other functions that just metabolic processing of glucose : plasminogen bound to α - enolase stimulates plasmin activation of mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) / extracellular - signal regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) prosurvival factor and also can drive plasmin degradation of amyloid - β ( A β ) protein , the main component of amyloid plaques . Thus , α - enolase might play a neuro - protective role through its multiple functions ( reviewed in [ 122 ] ) . Recently , several posttranslational modiﬁcations to α - enolase have been found in Alzheimer’s disease . Elevated levels of glycosylated - α - enolase [ 124 ] , oxidized [ 123 ] , or glu - tathionylated [ 125 ] have been found related to Alzheimer’s disease . These modiﬁcations would render enolase catal - lyticaly inactive , related to the metabolic deﬁcit associated to Alzheimer’s disease . The e ﬀ ect of these modiﬁcations in other multiple functions of α - enolase is a subject of ongoing experiments , but it is possible that α - enolase modiﬁcations alter not only glucose metabolism , but also its role as plasminogen receptor , controlling neuronal survival and A β degradation . 11 . Plasmin and Intracellular Signaling Other than its role in concentrating proteolytic activity on the cell surface , several recent studies have shown that plasmin is able to activate several intracellular signaling pathways , that led to the activation of several transcription factors , in a cell surface binding dependent way . In most of the cases , the molecular mechanism responsible remains unknown : it could be due to the proteolytic activation of a second factor or due to direct binding of plasmin ( ogen ) to a speciﬁc receptor . Several pieces of work show that the plasmin proteolytic activity is essential for the induction of an intracellular response , as in monocytes , where plasmin bound to the cell surface proteolytically activates annexin A2 and stimulates MMP - 1 production through the activation of ERK and p38 pathways [ 126 ] . The phosphorylation of Janus Kinase 1 ( JAK1 ) / Tyrosin Kinase 2 ( TYK2 ) that drives to the activation to the transcription factors AP - 1 and Nuclear Factor κ B ( NF κ B ) , and the expression of several Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 7 cytokines : interleukin - 1 α and - 1 β ( IL - 1 α and IL - 1 β ) , tissue factor ( TF ) , and the Tumoral Necrosis Factor - α ( TNF - α ) , are a consequence of plasmin interaction with the cell surface [ 127 – 129 ] . Plasmin promotes p38 and p44 / 42 MAPK activation and ﬁbroblast proliferation through Protease Activated Receptor - 1 ( PAR - 1 ) [ 130 , 131 ] . Other authors have described that plasminogen and plasmin regulate the gene transcription of genes as c - fos , erg - 1 , and Eno1 in mononucleated blood cells and ﬁbroblasts , by activating the MEK / ERK pathways [ 132 , 133 ] . In most of the cases , the receptor responsible for this cellular response remains to be identiﬁed . Most of the protein candidates for plasminogen receptors are small proteins that lack a transmembrane domain and are not able to induce directly an intracellular response . Some work suggests an association between the plasminogen receptor and other membrane proteins , that could serve as molecular collab - orators to induce the activation of intracellular signaling pathways . Several proteins have been identiﬁed as such molecular collaborators . For instance , plasmin can activate PAR - 1 in ﬁbroblasts , by the phosphorylation of Erk [ 130 ] ; plasminogen and plasmin activate the expression of several genes in ﬁbroblasts and monocytes through G - Protein Coupled Receptors , ( GPCR ) [ 132 , 133 ] ; some integrins such as α 9 β 1 integrin in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells [ 134 ] and α v β 3 integrin , in vascular endothelial cells [ 135 ] , participate actively in plasmin - induced cell migration . In none of these cases , the plasmin receptor associated with these proteins have been identiﬁed . Some work have identiﬁed annexin A2 as the receptor that concentrates plas - min activity to the cell surface and drives a subsequent intra - cellular response [ 127 – 129 ] . Other authors have described a collaboration between α - enolase and GPCR in ﬁbroblasts and mononucleated blood cells [ 132 , 133 ] . Plasmin induces smooth muscle cell proliferation through extracellular trans - activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) by a MMP - mediated , heparin binding—epidermal growth factor ( HB - EGF - ) dependent process [ 136 ] . Future studies will be necessary to determine the molecular mechanism of the plasminogen receptor on several cell types and the putative proteins associated with it . We have shown that plasmin activity is able to activate MAPK / ERK and phosphatidyl - inositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt pathways in C2C12 murine myoblast cell lines and in primary cultures of muscle precursor cells , and that intra - cellular activation depends on plasmin activity , but also on plasmin ( ogen ) binding to the cell surface in a lysine binding sites dependent way ( Roig - Borrellas et al . , unpublished results ) , although the receptor responsible and the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated . 12 . Concluding Remarks Recently , a proteomic meta - analysis of 169 published articles , including di ﬀ erently expressed 4700 proteins , based on 2 - dimensional electrophoresis analysis of human , mouse , and rat tissues , identiﬁed α - enolase as the ﬁrst protein di ﬀ erentially expressed in mice and the second in human pathologies , regardless of the tissue used and experiment performed [ 137 ] , suggesting that α - enolase could be part of a group of universal cellular sensors that respond to multiple di ﬀ erent stimuli . Thus , α - enolase could be considered as a marker of pathological stress in a high number of diseases . The importance of α - enolase as plasminogen receptor has been determined in several pathologies such as cancer , skele - tal myogenesis , Alzheimer’s disease , and rheumatoid arthri - tis , among others . α - Enolase upregulation has also been described in a myriad of other pathologies , as inﬂammatory bowel disease [ 138 , 139 ] , autoimmune hepatitis [ 140 ] , or membranous glomerulonephritis [ 141 ] , not discussed in this paper , although its role on concentrating plasmin activity on the cell surface has not always been stablished . It will not be surprising that in many of these pathologies , α - enolase could exert one of its multiple functions , mainly as a plasminogen receptor , focalizing plasmin activity on the cell membrane and promoting ECM degradation / remodeling , but also activating intracellular survival pathways and controlling survival / apoptosis of cells . Further studies of posttranslational modiﬁcations of α - enolase and its implications on α - enolase subcellular distribution and function , especially interaction with other proteins will be necessary . Also , the role of α - enolase as activator of intracellular signaling pathways , probably in collaboration with other membrane proteins , will serve to elucidate the multiples roles of this functionally complex protein . Unexpectedly , other glycolytic enzymes have been described as having other nonglycolytic functions in tran - scriptional regulation ( hexokinase - 2 , HK ; lactate dehydroge - nase A , LDH ; glyceraldehydes - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase , GAPDH ) , stimulation of cell motility ( glucose - 6 - phosphate isomerase ) , and regulation of apoptosis ( glucokinase , HK and GAPDH ) , indicating that they are more complicated , multifunctional proteins rather than simply components of the glycolytic pathway ( reviewed in [ 142 ] ) . Some of the more interesting and challenging issues , regarding α - enolase multifunction that need to be addressed are ( i ) the mechanism of its export to the cell surface , ( ii ) the role of α - enolase as an inductor of intracellular signaling pathways , and ( iii ) the role of posttranslational modiﬁcations of α - enolase and implications on its subcellular distribution and function . Investigations of these subjects in di ﬀ erent human pathologies will provide insights into its important role on pathophysiological processes and it would make this protein an interesting drug target for di ﬀ erent diseases .
