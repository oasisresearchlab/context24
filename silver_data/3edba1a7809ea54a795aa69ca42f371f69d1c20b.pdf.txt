Recently , there has been increasing interest in the accessibility community to support blind and low vision ( BLV ) people’s digital creative experiences . We conducted a mixed - method study to gain a com - prehensive understanding of their creative needs to inform and focus this line of research . Through a large - scale survey (  = 165 ) and follow - up interviews (  = 15 ) , we learned that BLV people are interested in a more diverse range of creative tasks than what is currently accessible . In particular , many forms of visual content creation and advanced expressions still remain challenging . Par - ticipants pointed out both accessibility improvements and social changes needed to fulfll personal creative pursuits . In turn , we dis - cuss potential design ideas to move toward more inclusive creative practices , such as developing alternative , non - visual information - sharing methods and establishing visual information presentation guidelines specifc to creative contexts .

In the past few years , more HCI and accessibility research has begun to explore ways that technology can support BLV content creators’ experiences in the digital space ( e . g . , [ 68 , 70 , 81 ] ) . So far , this body of research has revealed interests and experiences from a small number of BLV individuals on specifc creative tasks . How - ever , there has not been a large - scale , holistic exploration of the community’s creative needs across diferent types of digital content . This knowledge gap could lead to practitioners and researchers mak - ing assumptions about BLV people’s interests and thereby limiting exploration of new creation support for diverse content . As the feld grows , we argue the importance of shaping its focus based on the lived experiences and needs of BLV creators , especially given the wide landscape of digital creative activities and varied opportunities for potential support [ 25 ] . In this paper , we study BLV individuals’ interests , attitudes and experiences with creating diferent types of common digital content to inform and prioritize accessibility research eforts that ft the needs of the BLV creator community . We center our research on the following questions : • RQ1 : What types of digital content do BLV individuals want to create ? • RQ2 : What types of digital content have BLV individuals been creating ? • RQ3 : What accessibility improvements do BLV individuals desire ? We conducted a large - scale survey study (  = 165 ) and follow - up interviews (  = 15 ) with BLV creators about their experiences and needs across a range of digital content types , including text - based ( e . g . , formatted documents , blog posts ) , audio ( e . g . , podcasts , music ) , static visual ( e . g . , presentation slides , photographs ) , video ( e . g . , video blogs , flms ) , and interactive ( e . g . , websites , mobile apps ) content . From the survey study , we discovered that BLV respondents’ creation experiences primarily focused on digital content with lit - tle or no visual elements . However , respondents exhibited inter - est in a wide range of creative activities , including those that are more visually focused—such as static visual , video , and interactive content—despite those content types being particularly challenging to create . In probing for a more in - depth understanding of perspec - tives around visually heavy creative tasks in the interviews , we uncovered access barriers that are rooted in both technical and societal sources , such as a lack of feedback about visual content , difculty operating visually complex creative tools , and struggles with social bias and ableist practices . Participants shared how these barriers impede their professional success , self - expression , and so - cial participation . These fndings allow us to refect on the existing ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA Zhang , et al . focus of accessibility research in the creative space and the role of technology design in BLV creators’ experiences . Overall , this paper contributes : ( 1 ) a characterization of BLV people’s digital creative experiences and interests across common digital content types ; ( 2 ) an understanding of BLV people’s per - spectives toward challenging aspects of their creative experiences ; ( 3 ) a refection and discussion of technology design approaches to improve digital content creation accessibility and enact related social change . 2 RELATED WORK Accessibility of digital content with the BLV population has been an ongoing research focus for decades . While most work has focused on content consumption , there has been increasing attention on content creation . Below , we summarize research to support the digital creative activities of BLV people and the social context of those activities . 2 . 1 Accessibility Research and BLV Creators Early accessibility research related to BLV people’s digital creative activities centered on text authoring , computer programming , and photography , while the research community has more recently expanded to a wider range of creative pursuits , including audio creation , slide decks , video creation , and collaborative document creation . Text authoring . Firstly , text entry accessibility used to garner great research interest ( e . g . , [ 61 , 86 , 91 ] ) , but with mainstream tools increasingly equipped with accessibility support ( e . g . , speech in - put , screenreader - friendly keyboards ) , it is now a largely accessible task [ 61 ] . Text formatting , however , is still a persistent challenge . Accessibility issues arise with word and line spacing , capitaliza - tion , character format , and font size [ 22 , 23 ] . Consequently , many BLV people feel uncomfortable creating documents in which visual presentation is important [ 23 , 90 ] . Computer programming . Existing work covers common chal - lenges BLV programmers experience , including navigating inac - cessible development environments , debugging , creating visual layouts , and so on [ 5 , 40 , 56 , 60 , 75 ] . Past studies have noted inter - ests from BLV people with user interface design , but also challenges , such as lack of screen reader descriptions for visual information , in - dependence , and understanding of visual semantics [ 47 , 48 , 65 , 72 ] . Accordingly , this research proposed multimodal approaches to en - hance access to user interface layout ( e . g . , shape changing devices , touch screen gestures , tactile print - outs ) [ 47 , 49 , 73 ] as well as AI - based support for layout editing [ 71 ] . Photography . There has also been a longstanding efort to sup - port blind photography , grounded in blind people’s interests in and experiences with taking photos of human faces , nature , and objects [ 1 , 14 , 15 , 27 , 45 ] for memento keeping , artistic expression , social interactions , and visual interpretation purposes [ 2 , 10 , 27 , 31 , 37 , 89 ] . In taking photos , blind people experience challenges evaluating the content and quality of their photos , encounter digital camera interface accessibility issues ( e . g . , label issues , magnifcation difculty ) [ 2 , 10 , 27 , 31 , 67 ] , and have difculty authoring alterna - tive texts [ 55 ] . Researchers have thus proposed the use of computer vision to describe photo components ( e . g . , face , objects , texts ) and directions to adjust the camera ( e . g . , [ 8 , 15 , 37 , 43 ] ) , as well as speech , non - speech audio , and tactile cues to assist camera control , photo review and management [ 31 , 94 , 97 ] . So far , only a limited number of studies have explored BLV people’s interests and challenges with photo editing tasks [ 6 , 10 , 67 , 89 ] . Audio . Recent studies have explored how BLV people engage with digital audio creation [ 69 , 79 , 80 ] . While modern technology has made audio production more accessible , most mainstream tools still lack accessible features [ 57 , 88 ] . BLV creators have formed accessible solutions as a community , including plug - ins , external hardware , and online learning materials [ 69 , 80 ] , but the need to additionally piece together workarounds poses signifcant access labor , and numerous challenges still exist ( e . g . , incompatibility with screen readers , lack of independence , inefciency , cognitive over - load , learning curve ) [ 69 , 79 , 80 ] . Other work has proposed techno - logical innovations , including tactile representations of waveform , peak meter , and notation [ 4 , 57 , 68 ] , screen - reader accessible learn - ing resources [ 79 ] , as well as voice - based and physical control support ( e . g , [ 29 , 39 , 64 , 88 ] ) . So far , existing work focuses primar - ily on music production and is mostly informed by a small set of experienced audio producers . Presentation slides and artboards . Presentation slides are ubiqui - tous but largely rely on vision to create , which poses professional and educational barriers to the BLV community [ 70 , 81 , 95 ] . Blind people primarily use a combination of screen readers and sighted support to access and author presentations slides [ 70 , 81 ] . However , screen readers often provide insufcient descriptions , thus leading to high cognitive load , uncertainty , lack of control , and collabora - tive challenges [ 70 , 81 ] . In turn , there are a number of technological attempts to improve accessibility of slide creation , such as providing spatial exploration afordances through touch and gesture [ 95 , 96 ] , involving speech input to ease control , as well as enriched audio descriptions of slide style changes and collaborative information through screen readers [ 70 , 95 ] . Video . Video creation , mostly in the context of social media , has also recently received more focus . Many BLV creators use popular video - based social media platforms such as YouTube and Twitch to deliver accessibility related messages , publish tutorials , show daily life , connect with others , and gain proft [ 38 , 46 , 62 , 77 , 82 , 83 ] . Past studies noted BLV creators’ challenges with video editing interfaces ( e . g . , incompatibility with screen readers , missing descriptions ) and difculties of visually evaluating content [ 35 , 38 , 77 , 83 ] . While a small group of creators do perform basic editing such as trimming , clipping , or adding flters , most creators stream or post raw videos to avoid editing tasks [ 35 , 38 , 77 ] . Their videos are further nega - tively impacted from biases in content moderation policies that favor the visual aesthetic standards of sighted people [ 77 ] . To date , technological innovations related to BLV people’s video creation are still sparse ( only one existing work explored the use of script to enable non - visual video editing [ 35 ] ) , and there is little attention on video creation outside of the social media context . Collaborative authoring . Finally , recent research has revealed extensive challenges around inaccessible collaborative activities in Understanding Digital Content Creation Needs of Blind and Low Vision People ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA document creation ( e . g . , document changes , real - time editing , high - level overview of collaborative actions , inaccessible practices of sighted collaborators ) [ 20 , 21 , 44 , 54 , 66 , 70 , 74 ] . Consequently , this body of research calls for awareness of collaborators’ access needs among sighted people [ 19 , 21 ] and proposed design ideas around utilizing on - demand auditory feedback , keyboard commands , and message boxes to provide collaborative information [ 21 , 42 , 70 ] . Summary . Past work has explored BLV people’s experiences with a range of content . Overall , they tend to involve the follow - ing accessibility barriers : failing to follow accessibility standards , providing little support for evaluation of visual content , lacking accessible collaboration features , and posing learning challenges . While existing work has provided exploratory insights with a set of specifc digital creative activities , we lack a holistic understanding of what types of content BLV people are currently creating and what they desire to create . This understanding is critical for researchers to allocate resources based on BLV people’s collective needs instead of researchers’ personal judgment , without pre - imposing interest in a specifc content type . We also know little about BLV people’s creation goals and contexts , as well as issues preventing them from realizing their creation goals . This paper addresses this knowledge gap through an in - depth , large - scale empirical exploration with BLV content creators . 2 . 2 Social Context of Creation Practice and Disability Disability and the ability to create are historically entangled con - cepts . In many cultures , disability is inaccurately characterized with an incapability of producing labor [ 3 , 50 , 78 ] . Such assumption has led to structural and social oppression toward disabled individuals’ social standing . As a result , disabled communities experience a high rate of unemployment and limited access to education [ 3 , 50 , 78 ] . For the BLV population in particular , there has been a long - standing , exaggerated value that sighted people place on vision , which has led to ableist assumptions and oppressive practices [ 3 , 30 , 41 ] . One example is the myth that beauty is only rendered through visual means and that blind people could not perceive aesthetics ( i . e . , ‘aesthetic blindness’ ) [ 16 , 59 ] , despite that , in reality , many BLV individuals appreciate and practice arts [ 7 ] . Nevertheless , sighted people theorize about blind experiences through an “ominous mark of otherness” [ 41 ] , ignoring the value and culture within the BLV community and socially excluding them from a range of creative activities , including design [ 12 , 70 , 81 ] , research [ 52 , 92 , 93 ] , art tasks [ 33 ] , and so on [ 16 ] . Disabled bodies are often treated as “non - designing bodies” and disabled people’s intellectual creations have historically been “silenced” [ 11 ] . In turn , everyday practices related to creative activities often perpetuate oppressive structures to BLV individuals [ 53 ] , such as heavy use of inaccessible materials in school and at work [ 24 , 70 , 81 ] , expectations for BLV people to read regular print instead of large print or braille [ 34 ] , and discrimina - tions related to hiring and work conditions despite disability rights activism to gain access to the mainstream labor market [ 17 , 78 ] . These practices encourage the notion that disability is a negative aspect that disabled people need to overcome to be valued [ 34 ] and require extra access labor from them to accomplish the same task as non - disabled counterparts [ 36 , 52 , 84 ] . As such , disabled people often experience anxiety around disclosing access needs in hopes of ‘ftting in’ the non - disabled world [ 36 ] and in certain cases lose con - fdence and become disinterested in inaccessible creative tasks [ 33 ] . Blind disability studies scholars thus call for less bias from sighted people and more recognition of valuable blind experiences besides the mere absence of sight [ 41 ] . Our paper extends this literature by exploring social considerations involved in BLV people’s digital creation experience , in hope of informing accessibility support to shape a more inclusive creative environment . 3 FORMATIVE SURVEY To broadly understand creation interests and experiences of the BLV community , we frst conducted an online survey covering common digital creative tasks . 3 . 1 Method 3 . 1 . 1 Recruitment . We recruited survey respondents primarily through the National Federation of the Blind ( NFB ) mailing list as well as BLV - focused Facebook Groups , Twitter , and Reddit . Re - spondents had to be at least 18 years old and identify as having vision loss or visual impairment ( e . g . , blind , low vision ) . We ofered respondents the opportunity to opt into a drawing for a $ 75 Amazon gift card ( odds of winning : 1 in every 30 respondents ) . 3 . 1 . 2 Survey Outline . The survey was designed to take up to 25 minutes . The survey started with a question to screen out respon - dents who do not identify as BLV , followed by fve sections ( in randomized order ) with focused questions on respondents’ expe - rience with creating fve common types of digital content . These types included text - based ( e . g . , formatted documents , blog posts ) , audio ( e . g . , podcasts , music ) , static visual ( e . g . , presentation slides , photographs ) , video ( e . g . , video blogs , flms ) , and interactive ( e . g . , websites , mobile apps ) content . The survey concluded with a sec - tion on demographics and additional comments . We derived the fve digital content categories by reviewing and coding through existing digital content glossaries [ 9 , 26 , 58 , 76 ] . For each content type , we asked respondents to frst indicate whether they had experience in creating such content . Based on that answer , they were then sent to either the “with experience” or “without experience” subsection . The “with experience” subsection focused on questions related to motivation , interest , frequency , and perceived difculty with the creation of this type of content , followed up by open - ended questions that probe for descriptions on typical creation experience with this type of content , including the context in which it is created , a list of tools or support used for creation ( optional ) , and an explanation of the selected difculty level ( optional ) . The “without experience” subsection asked respondents about what stopped them from creating the content type as well as potential motivation and interest with creating it , and followed up with an open - ended question asking for a description of potential challenges in the creation of the content type ( optional ) . The last section provided the opportunity for respondents to add additional content creation experience and content types that they want to create but fnd difcult . Respondents were then asked demo - graphic questions—including degree of visual impairment or vision loss , education , computer access frequency and methods , age , onset ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA Zhang , et al . of visual impairment , gender , occupation , and additional disability - related information—as well as contact information for opting into the gift card drawing and / or follow - up study recruitment . Please see supplementary materials for the full set of questions . After seeking feedback on survey platforms from screen reader users and accessibility researchers in our institute , we decided to host the survey on Google Forms . The survey was piloted with six BLV individuals to ensure accessibility , and the study protocol was approved by an Institutional Review Board . 3 . 1 . 3 Data and Analysis . The survey initially obtained 181 re - sponses , with 165 coming from private BLV organizations ( NFB and private BLV Facebook Groups ) and 16 from more public sources ( authors’ academic Twitter accounts and r / Blind Reddit forum ) . The frst and second author collaboratively reviewed responses to screen out duplicate and malicious entries ( e . g . , entries with repeated de - mographic and contact information or nonsensical open - ended responses ) . This screening resulted in 165 valid entries . For choose - all - that - apply and multiple choice questions , our analysis focused primarily on descriptive statistics ( e . g . , frequen - cies , percentages ) to understand the trends and preferences of BLV respondents . We analyzed and presented responses across respon - dents’ vision conditions , considering blind and low vision respon - dents’ potential diference in computer and visual information ac - cess ( as indicated in prior literature [ 87 ] ) . For open - ended questions , we performed a thematic analysis on all qualitative responses . Two researchers collaboratively developed an initial codebook and in - dependently coded 25 respondents’ data based on the codebook . Cohen’s kappa was calculated to assess the inter - rater reliability between two researchers . The codes with low inter - rater reliability were then discussed and updated . With the iterated codebook ( in supplementary materials ) , two researchers independently coded another 25 respondents’ data , resulting in an average kappa of 0 . 84 (   = . 13 ) across all fnalized codes . The second author then con - sistently applied the fnalized codes on all remaining respondents’ data , with input from other team members . Below , we use percentages to report quantitative analysis results , whereas respondent counts are linked to qualitative themes . Per - centages used for vision condition groups are based on the total number of respondents in each group ( i . e . , 79 for low vision respon - dents and 86 for blind respondents ) , except for perceived challenge levels , which are limited to the number of respondents who have experience creating the corresponding content in each group . 3 . 2 Results In this section , we present BLV respondents’ demographics , creation interests and experiences captured in the survey . In reporting quotes from respondents , we use the following acronyms to indicate self - reported vision levels alongside respondent IDs : TB = totally blind , SL = some light perception , LB : legally blind , LV : low vision . 3 . 2 . 1 Demographics and Background . Our survey respondents ranged from 19 to 75 years old (       = 40 ,  = 41 . 1 ,   = 14 . 5 ) , with 94 self - reported as women 1 , 68 men 2 , two non - binary , and one pre - ferring not to reveal their gender . Around half of the respondents ( 52 . 1 % ,  = 86 ) self - reported as either “totally blind” or with “some light perception , ” while the other half ( 47 . 9 % ,  = 79 ) self - reported as either “low vision” or “legally blind . ” We refer to the former group as blind respondents and to the latter group as low vision respondents . Respondents’ onset of visual impairment ranged from ages 0 to 58 (       = 1 ,  = 10 . 3 ,   = 14 . 5 ) . In terms of methods to access computers and smart devices , the most common option was screen reader ( 85 . 5 % ,  = 141 ) , followed by screen magnifca - tion software ( 25 . 5 % ,  = 42 ) , system settings ( 24 . 8 % ,  = 41 ) , help from others ( 20 . 0 % ,  = 33 ) , and other ( 3 . 0 % ,  = 5 ) . Almost all respondents ( 86 . 1 % ,  = 142 ) used a laptop or desktop computer once a day or more , 8 . 5 % used around once a week (  = 14 ) , 4 . 8 % around once a year or less (  = 8 ) , and 0 . 6 % around once a month (  = 1 ) . Similarly , 91 . 5 % of respondents used a smartphone or tablet once a day or more (  = 151 ) , 4 . 8 % around once a week (  = 8 ) , 1 . 8 % around once a month (  = 3 ) , and 1 . 8 % around once a year or less (  = 3 ) . Please see supplementary materials for additional demographic information . 3 . 2 . 2 Overall Digital Creative Experience . As indicated in Figure 1 , respondents showed an overall interest in creating all fve general types of digital content . For blind respondents , text - based con - tent was of the broadest interest ( 89 . 5 % ) , followed by audio content ( 79 . 1 % ) , video content ( 76 . 7 % ) , static visual content ( 69 . 8 % ) , and inter - active content ( 57 . 0 % ) . Fewer respondents had experience actually creating these varied types of content , with blind respondents’ ex - perience primarily focused on text - based ( 88 . 4 % ) and audio ( 76 . 7 % ) content ( Figure 1 ) . Notably , around 20 % of the blind respondents who were interested in creating static visual , video and interactive content , had never had experience creating those types . Relatedly , as shown in Figure 2 , static visual and video content were considered somewhat to extremely difcult to create by the majority of blind respondents who have experience creating these types of content ( static visual content : 72 . 7 % ; video content : 65 . 9 % ) , whereas only a small portion of blind respondents regarded text - based content and audio content to be difcult ( text - based content : 9 . 2 % ; audio content : 19 . 7 % ) . We observed similar trends among low vision respondents ( Fig - ures 1 and 2 ) . Text - based and audio content were also considered more interesting and less difcult by low vision respondents , and they had overall more experience in creating these content types than static visual , video , and interactive content . Interestingly , a higher percentage of low vision respondents shared interest in ( 74 . 7 % ) and experience with ( 62 . 0 % ) static visual content compared to their blind counterparts . As a result , static visual content was second - highest of the content types in both interest level and ex - perience for low vision respondents , surpassing audio and video content—the second and third most popular content types among blind respondents . Only a small number of respondents specifed additional con - tent types in which they had interest (  = 32 ) and / or experience (  = 14 ) . However , these open - ended responses mostly indicated a 1 including 88 responses of “Female” , two “Woman” , two “Cis - gender Female” , and one “Biological Female” 2 including 62 responses of “Male” , fve “Man” , and one “Cis - gender Male” Understanding Digital Content Creation Needs of Blind and Low Vision People ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA Figure 1 : Percentages of respondents with experience and interest in fve general content creation types across visual conditions , sorted in descending order . In summary , blind and low vision people’s interest in creating digital content did not vary greatly across content types or vision condition , but their actual creation experience centered on text - based and audio content , especially for blind people . Error bars are 95 % confdence intervals . Figure 2 : Perceived difculty levels with creating the fve general content types from respondents who have experience creating them , sorted in descending order . In summary , blind respondents perceive static visual and video content to be more challenging and text - based and audio content to be less challenging , with interactive content somewhere in between . Low vision respondents share the same profle , but not as extreme . sub - category of the fve digital content types , such as “utility soft - wares” ( P5 , LB ) , “AR and VR” ( P10 , SL ) , and “Architectural drawing” ( P144 , SL ) . Therefore , we present these data together with their responses associated with the general content types . Below , we dive into respondents’ interests , experiences and barriers with the fve types of content creation , with a focus on the ones with higher interest level and creation difculty : static visual , video and interac - tive content . We also briefy present respondents’ experience with two content types that are considered relatively accessible to create , text - based and audio content , and summarize issues still remaining with them . 3 . 2 . 3 Static visual content : The majority of respondents were mo - tivated to create static visual content at some point . Professional activity was the primary motivator for creating static visual con - tent for both blind ( 62 . 8 % ) and low vision ( 64 . 6 % ) respondents . For example , many respondents shared that they were often required to create static visual content at work and school , as P159 ( SL ) de - scribed : “The two main reasons for me creating static visual content ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA Zhang , et al . have been for school and work . . . During my coursework , I was fre - quently required to create blog posts and Power Point presentations which required me to create and edit static visual content . ” Besides pressure in professional settings , family or friends and personal interest were also motivators for creating static visual content ( both chosen by around 30 % of blind and 40 % of low vision respondents ) . Example scenarios where respondents felt motivated to create static visual content included : “educating colleagues at work regarding how assistive technologies work” ( P144 , SL ) , “memorializing an event or day” ( P151 , TB ) , and “using in my son’s school portfolio” ( P151 , TB ) . Many respondents ( 32 . 2 % of blind , 19 . 0 % of low vision ) explicitly indicated that although they had interest in creating static visual content , they were prevented from doing so because of access bar - riers . Respondents mentioned two main barriers : ( 1 ) inaccessibility of creation tools (  = 23 ) —incompatibility with screen readers , unlabeled elements , difculty with navigating multi - layer menus , inability to zoom - in , and ( 2 ) challenges with visual arrangement and design , including difculties with evaluating visual appeal (  = 34 ) and details (  = 6 ) as well as understanding visual con - cepts (  = 6 ) , as P102 ( LB ) shared : “Because I do not have a good sense of what this content typically looks like and I do not have feed - back on whether what I am creating looks good or not” , which many deemed as “unnerving and undermines confdence” ( P158 , SL ) . Respondents who had been able to create static visual content de - scribed their usage of both mainstream tools ( e . g . , presentation slide editors (  = 43 ) , camera apps (  = 16 ) , image editors (  = 19 ) , spreadsheets (  = 8 ) ) as well as assistive tools ( e . g . , screen readers (  = 24 ) , screen magnifcation (  = 8 ) , visual interpretation ser - vices such as Aira (  = 7 ) ) in the creation process . Some low vision respondents also reported using their remaining vision to work on visual creative tasks , which was described as “doable but not ideal” by one participant ( P116 , LV ) , as seeing details and subtle changes can still be challenging . While some respondents mentioned want - ing to “get as much information as possible independently” ( P158 , SL ) , many of them felt that sighted help is necessary (  = 28 ) , as P91 explained : “I hesitate without getting sighted assistance because I cannot guarantee that the text on each slide is not going to be out of alignment and I also need assistance obtaining graphics to make sure the presentations look good” ( P91 , TB ) . Our respondents most often reported creating presentation slides ( blind : 38 . 4 % ; low vision : 49 . 5 % ) , digital photos ( blind : 24 . 4 % ; low vision : 38 . 0 % ) , promotional materials ( blind : 17 . 4 % ; low vision : 34 . 2 % ) , and informational fgures ( blind : 22 . 1 % ; low vision : 31 . 7 % ) . 3 . 2 . 4 Video content : Our BLV respondents were commonly moti - vated to create videos for sharing with family and friends ( blind : 60 . 5 % ; low vision : 44 . 3 % ) : “ [ I create ] mostly videos of my pets doing something cute that I can either share with family or friends or listen to later” ( P126 , TB ) . At the same time , many of them were also motivated to create videos for personal interest ( blind : 51 . 2 % ; low vision : 41 . 8 % ) and professional purposes ( blind : 47 . 7 % ; low vision : 34 . 2 % ) . However , only 51 . 2 % of blind respondents and 54 . 4 % of low vision respondents have created videos before . Their videos were mostly raw recordings ( blind : 40 . 0 % ; low vision : 29 . 1 % ) , in the form of vlogs and social media shorts . Some respondents ( 16 . 28 % of blind , 19 . 0 % of low vision ) also streamed online , such as for “games” ( P43 , SL ) , “classes” ( P66 , LB ) , “religious services” ( P18 , LB ) . As with static visual content , respondents also navigated video creation with com - mon assistive technologies—screen readers (  = 18 ) , Aira (  = 2 ) , and magnifer (  = 1 ) —and sighted help (  = 14 ) . For recording , they commonly used smart phones or tablets (  = 39 ) , sometimes with help of a tripod (  = 5 ) . Some respondents (  = 19 ) further mentioned using a video editor—most commonly Adobe Premiere , iMovie and Final Cut Pro X . Some respondents also reported experiencing inaccessible pro - cesses with video creation ( 30 . 2 % blind and 19 . 0 % low vision re - spondents ) . Many listed camera alignment (  = 35 ) and editing (  = 37 ) as the most inaccessible steps : “Making the video is fairly easy , but editing the video and adding efects is more difcult” ( P120 , LV ) . The editing process of video shared two similar issues with static visual content creation : ( 1 ) inaccessible tools and ( 2 ) evaluat - ing visual outcomes : “all I can do with video editing on my own is crop a video . I’m not able to do any extensive editing such as adjusting colors , brightness , inserting or deleting specifc frames within a video and checking for visual errors within the video” ( P59 , LB ) . Addition - ally , respondents found the video editing tools “geared towards the sighted and those who are very computer literate” ( P119 , LV ) , and that screen feedback “interrupts the fow of recorded video” ( P65 , TB ) . 3 . 2 . 5 Interactive content : Among all fve content types , interactive content received the least creative interest from our respondents . Still , more than half of our respondents felt the need to create such content . Their common motivation was to support professional activities ( blind : 45 . 3 % ; low vision : 41 . 7 % ) , while some of them also saw interactive content creation helpful for personal interests ( blind : 34 . 9 % ; low vision : 27 . 9 % ) and connecting with family and friends ( blind : 26 . 7 % ; low vision : 21 . 5 % ) . For example , P5 ( SL ) mentioned creating Wordpress websites for “university” as well as “organiz - ing virtual events” . However , only a very small portion have had experience with interactive content creation ( See Figure 1 ) . 37 . 2 % of blind and 35 . 4 % of low vision respondents found the creation process inaccessible and gave up trying . Again , many creation tools did not meet the basic accessibility standard (  = 21 ) , and our respondents commonly faced challenges evaluating visual format (  = 12 ) . However , the most prominent challenge we observed was the high bar to acquire relevant skills (  = 22 ) , especially because they found “learning to be highly time consuming , given the visual nature of websites , jargon , and slow web - browsing” ( P41 , LB ) as well as “the instructions often written for people who are sighted and in - clude directions such as pointing and clicking or locating something visual on the screen” ( P105 , TB ) . While we were not able to obtain a comprehensive understand - ing of respondents’ creation experience from the small number who had experience creating interactive content , we briefy report their responses . First , these respondents mostly focused on creating questionnaires ( blind : 30 . 2 % ; low vision : 21 . 5 % ) and web pages built from templates ( blind : 21 . 0 % ; low vision : 24 . 1 % ) . Only a very small percentage of them had experience with general programming ( blind : 0 . 3 % ; low vision : 10 . 1 % ) , which is more complex to learn and practice . They made use of templates from website building tools ( e . g . , Wordpress ) (  = 20 ) , survey creators ( e . g . , Google Forms ) (  = 23 ) , and general developer tools ( e . g . , IDE , command line ) (  = 10 ) in their creation process , as well as common accessibility Understanding Digital Content Creation Needs of Blind and Low Vision People ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA tools—screen readers (  = 19 ) , magnifer (  = 3 ) , Aira and Seeing AI (  = 3 ) . 3 . 2 . 6 Text - based Content : The majority of respondents have been creating a wide range of text - based content and regard the process to be relatively accessible . Respondents commonly write letters and emails ( blind : 87 . 2 % ; low vision : 67 . 8 % ) , short online posts ( blind : 80 . 2 % ; low vision : 62 . 0 % ) , reports and documents ( blind : 54 . 7 % ; low vision : 35 . 4 % ) , blog posts ( blind : 41 . 9 % ; low vision : 27 . 9 % ) , creative stories ( blind : 33 . 7 % ; low vision : 31 . 7 % ) , and poetry and prose ( blind : 30 . 2 % ; low vision : 27 . 9 % ) . They felt motivated to create these types of content for personal interest ( blind : 82 . 6 % ; low vision : 62 . 0 % ) , relationship with family and friends ( blind : 80 . 2 % ; low vision : 67 . 1 % ) and professional activities ( blind : 77 . 9 % ; low vision : 67 . 1 % ) . Many respondents reported use of screen readers (  = 67 ) , screen mag - nifers (  = 15 ) , braille technologies (  = 14 ) , dictation software (  = 11 ) and keyboard commands (  = 7 ) in creating texts . With these accessibility supports , the majority of them have developed competency , confdence , and familiarity with the creation process : “The biggest reason it’s easy is because I do it so regularly for every - thing . I have the keyboard shortcut commands in my head , the phone gestures in my head , and I have a lot of support from family friends and co - workers when I get stumped” ( P163 , LV ) . Still , a number of accessibility issues remain . First , many respon - dents (  = 33 ) pointed out challenges with formatting texts : “Style and alignment are often difcult as well as fnding and sizing images to go with the content” ( P181 , TB ) . Many respondents thus utilized sighted help (  = 12 ) and visual interpretation technologies ( e . g . , Aira , Seeing AI ) (  = 3 ) to check visual formatting and appeal of their text documents . Six respondents also mentioned that some online text editor felds ( e . g . , social media , email editors ) posed accessibility barriers , while four low vision respondents specifcally pointed out issues with color contrast and interface element size . 3 . 2 . 7 Audio Content : A lot of respondents enjoyed creating audio content for personal interest ( blind : 67 . 4 % ; low vision : 53 . 2 % ) and sharing with family and friends ( blind : 62 . 8 % ; low vision : 41 . 8 % ) — “Creating a mixture of songs to present virtual gift to friends” ( P5 , SL ) . Some of our respondents’ careers were related to audio creation ( e . g . , voice acting , sound engineer ) and thus were also motivated by professional purposes ( blind : 48 . 8 % ; low vision : 39 . 0 % ) . The most commonly created audio content type among our respondents was raw audio recordings ( blind : 70 . 9 % ; low vision : 55 . 7 % ) , followed by podcasts ( blind : 27 . 9 % ; low vision : 15 . 2 % ) and digital music compositions ( blind : 16 . 3 % ; low vision : 12 . 7 % ) . Interestingly , while 76 . 7 % of blind respondents had created audio content , only 58 . 2 % of low vision respondents had related expe - rience . More low vision respondents ( 16 . 5 % ) felt access barriers creating audio content compared to their blind counterparts ( 7 . 0 % ) . One possible explanation may be related to diference in efort and commitment , as P73 said : “As a blind person , audio is the best way for me to express myself , so I learned how to use Goldwave and make use of it often” ( P73 , SL ) . Indeed , while eleven blind respondents included descriptions of the efort they took to learn relevant tools and skills as well as how their interest level kept them up , only two low vision respondents shared similar experiences , with addition - ally nine confessing that audio content creation is not something they have spent time learning . Overall , both blind and low vision respondents agreed that cap - turing raw audio is relatively accessible and easy (  = 57 ) . Common assistive technologies ( e . g . , screen readers (  = 22 ) , screen mag - nifer (  = 2 ) ) as well as simplistic recording applications ( e . g . , voice memo ) (  = 47 ) and podcast applications ( e . g . , Anchor . com ) (  = 5 ) were considered helpful tools . Some (  = 40 ) respondents also mentioned using more advanced audio editors ( most commonly Audacity , Reaper , GoldWave , Garage Band ) , but they experienced challenges with a range of features of these tools (  = 14 ) , such as “trimming” ( P28 , SL ) , “mixing something inspirational or improvised in a timely manner” ( P74 , SL ) , “precise editing” ( P11 , SL ) . P113 ( TB ) expressed : “It is not difcult to create recordings , but I fnd it very difcult to create high quality recordings . ” As with the creative tools for other content , existing audio creation tools also still had basic accessibility issues , such as incompatibility with screen readers and complicated menu layout . Summary : Our survey results suggest that BLV respondents’ creative interests do not vary greatly across the modality of content . However , their creation experience is more limited with static visual , video , and interactive content , due to challenges with evaluating visual component and operating visually oriented interfaces . 4 INTERVIEW STUDY Given the common interests and access barriers survey respondents reported with visual - heavy creative tasks , we conducted a semi - structured interview to follow up on BLV creators’ perspectives on these tasks . 4 . 1 Methods 4 . 1 . 1 Participants . Participants had to be at least 18 years old and identify as blind or having low vision . We sent recruitment emails to the 146 survey respondents who had agreed to be contacted for future studies and invited them to spread the recruitment ad in their networks . In total , we recruited 15 BLV creators . Two of these participants had not completed the survey study , so we asked them to complete a revised version of the survey that included only demographic information ( e . g . , age , gender , disability status ) and experiences with creating the fve general types of content . Partici - pants’ self - reported age , gender , vision conditions , computer access methods , and experience with creating the fve digital content types are shown in Table 1 . In summary , participants ranged from 20 to 65 years old (       = 43 ,  = 40 . 33 ) , with seven self - identifying as female , six male , one nonbinary , and one preferring not to an - swer . Five participants self - reported as totally blind , fve with low vision , four with some light perception , and one legally blind . Eight indicated memory of previously seeing things , whereas the rest never had visual memory . Despite these varied visual conditions , all participants reported using a screen reader as the primary method for accessing technology . All participants had experience creating at least two types of content , most commonly text - based (  = 15 ) and audio (  = 13 ) content , followed by static visual (  = 10 ) , video (  = 7 ) and interactive (  = 6 ) content . Participants were compensated with a $ 45 Amazon gift card for their time and ef - fort . The recruitment and study procedure were approved by an Institutional Review Board .

These semi - structured interviews were designed to take up to 90 minutes and were conducted remotely via video conferencing software . Following the study introduction and verbal consent , participants were asked short questions to confrm their survey responses , including their creation experiences and visual conditions . Then , for each of the fve types of digital content the participant had experience in creating , the interviewer guided them to refect : “I’d like to know more about your experience with creating [ the given type of ] content . What content do you usually create ? What challenges did you encounter when you were creating ( the given type of content ) , if there are any ? ” While participants conveyed their experience with the given type of content , the interviewer probed for perspectives on the visual - heavy aspects of the experience , including ( a ) evaluating and manipulating content that is visual in nature ( e . g . , presentation slides , photos , illustrations ) or visual components in text - based , interactive or video content , and ( b ) operating visually oriented creation tools ( e . g . , audio editors , video editors ) . Specifcally , participants were asked about their experience with these aspects , perceived importance of them under diferent situations , challenges experienced , corresponding coping strategies , and related future support that they desire . After discussing the types of content with which the partici - pant had experience , the interviewer briefy inquired about any remaining content types ( e . g . , “What stopped you from creating this content ? ” ) . The interviews then concluded with high - level ques - tions around overall creativity needs and how they envision these needs could be better supported . 4 . 1 . 3 Analysis . To analyze participants’ perspectives toward vi - sual creative tasks and advanced editing tasks , we adopted an ex - ploratory thematic analysis approach ( as outlined by Braun and Clark [ 18 ] ) . In the frst phase of analysis , the frst author , who con - ducted all interviews , read and re - read the interview transcripts to identify an initial set of codes , with inputs from the rest of the research team . The research team then collaboratively devel - oped an initial codebook to guide the coding activity . The frst author individually coded all of the transcripts , with the second author selecting ( based on a random number generator ) half of the coded transcripts to review . Through multiple iterations , the fnal codebook focused on participants’ attitudes toward visually heavy creative tasks , under - supported creation pursuits , and desired improvements . With inputs from the team , the frst author then extracted salient themes from the coded excerpts and organized them into the fndings . 4 . 2 Findings We detail interview participants’ experiences with and attitudes toward visual - heavy aspects of their existing digital creation pro - cess , highlighting both technical and societal barriers involved in these tasks that infuence participants’ creation pursuits and related creativity support tool designs they desire . 4 . 2 . 1 Creation Needs Impeded by Visually Heavy Digital Creation Processes . Everyone in our interview study mentioned at least one way that existing visually heavy creation processes and tools under - support their pursuits of personal creative goals . In particular , so - cietal barriers were often brought up as an important issue that contributed to the visual - focused creation process (  = 14 ) . These societal barriers primarily manifested in expectations on BLV indi - viduals’ relation and interaction with diferent creative tasks—six participants described feeling that the world they live in is “sighted” ( P5 , P6 , P10 , P15 ) , “visual” ( P11 ) and “prejudiced” ( P4 ) , and that the expectation to engage in visually heavy creative tasks is inevitable in everyday life . At the same time , participants commonly perceived such visual creation tasks to be deeply inaccessible , with insufcient (  = 13 ) or unhelpful (  = 10 ) feedback for manipulating visual content , limited guidance on visual aesthetic standards (  = 6 ) , vision - reliant editing interfaces (  = 6 ) and time consuming work processes (  = 9 ) . Below , we detail how BLV participants perceive and navigate these intertwined barriers of structural inaccessibility and social oppression , focusing on three goals that our participants commonly desired to pursue through digital content creation but felt that existing tools and processes do not support . Professional Success : First , 13 out of 15 participants felt chal - lenges in achieving desired professional success with existing visual - heavy digital creation processes and expectations . Six participants shared their frustrations and struggles with educational and work - place requirements that focus on visual formatting and presen - tation . In particular , P3 , P8 and P14 experienced difculties with Understanding Digital Content Creation Needs of Blind and Low Vision People ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA following academic writing standards ( e . g . , citation style ) , while P5 commented on the visual nature of a resume : “a resume has to look physically balanced , and it’s usually one page . . . it’s just one of those cultural things that ends up being a visual thing” ( P5 ) . Mean - while , P2 , P7 , and P8 were pressured to create presentation slides and videos ; for example , P2 said of his plans to go back to school : “I’ll have to do all sorts of PowerPoint presentations . It sounds like a nightmare” that he would need to “power through” ( P2 ) to pursue his educational goals . Some participants voiced the hope for more inclusive educational and professional evaluation standards that are less visually focused , as P8 shared : “I would much rather prefer assignments that focus on screen - reader appealing” ( P8 ) . However , as with P2 , the majority of participants (  = 13 ) felt the need to conform to existing visual - heavy practices to achieve professional goals . For example , P12 felt that the visual appearance of his website is “where I can project the fact that I am a competent web developer . I know what I’m doing , and you know that my blindness is not gonna keep me from doing this” ( P12 ) . P15 instead focused more on how the visual appearance of work documents infuences the success of her organization : “We really wanted it [ the presentation slide deck ] to look good . . . It was pro - fessional content that was going to be saved that would be like the base of our organization” . P7 also felt the need to consider visual design when sharing information broadly : “producing professional quality documents and presentation slides in order to reach a wider audience reasonably quickly” ( P7 ) . While labor intensive , these participants had developed strategies to non - visually evaluate and manipulate visual content , such as through screen reader functionality ( e . g . , JAWS’ formatting functions , mobile phone camera accessibility fea - tures ) , sighted peers’ verbal feedback (  = 14 ) , templates (  = 6 ) , and familiarization with visual standards (  = 7 ) . Some partici - pants expressed confdence to “do all the formatting independently” but still feel the need to have “a fnal check ( from a sighted person ) to make sure it looks okay” ( P11 ) . At the same time , some partici - pants chose to avoid visual tasks by engaging in other non - visual compensating strategies , such as using a “minimal” ( P6 , P10 ) and “basic” ( P9 ) styling approach , “using my memory for bringing up facts or information that I need for presenting something” ( P1 ) . While participants often struggle to meet visual creation require - ments that they do not necessarily want , societal biases can also restrict desired opportunities to pursue creative professions—with some sighted people considering these activities to be too visual for a blind or low vision creator . For example , P10 described : “When I’m in a job interview , for example , they’d say how are you gonna do this task . Once they realize that I’m blind , there’s the perception out there that using the computer is specifcally visual . . . we have to kind of overcome a society in general” ( P10 ) . Similarly , P12 , who is a blind software developer , found it difcult to fnd clients who “want to commit to working with me as a blind developer” ( P12 ) . Participants hoped for more inclusive expectations from society about BLV cre - ators’ interest levels and capabilities : “Ever since I started college , I said - it has to be visually appealing . It has to be the way instructors require . . . I always tell my instructors : treat me as you would have treated other students . Don’t let me of the hook , unless I say : I need help with this” ( P8 ) . Self - expression and interest : Turning to a more personal rather than professional context , most participants ( 11 out of 15 ) felt that their personal interests and opportunities for self - expression were limited by existing creativity tools and processes . In particu - lar , eight participants wished for more access to creating personal visual expressions , such as artistic photos and videos , personally styled visual formatting , drawing , and video editing . While some with previous sighted experience expressed their natural inclina - tion to care about visual components of their creation— “my caring comes from the fact that I did have sight , and I appreciate art . I was good at art honestly , and so , knowing that there’s an artistic aspect to a photo , it is important to me” ( P6 ) , some of our congenitally blind participants also indicated interest in visual tasks . For example , P4 wanted a way to express her visual imaginations : “I do have dreams where I have a kind of vision in the dream , and I’ve never had vision . . . I’ve often said that I wish I could have some good artists jacked into my brain so that . . . he’ll jot it down for me” ( P4 ) . How - ever , as presented in the previous section , participants perceive that these creative interests and capabilities were often neglected by society in skillful and visual - heavy content creation : “I think probably the myth is that blind people don’t care how things look , and I think we really do” ( P15 ) . There have been longstanding biases related to what BLV people want to , could , or should create that our participants often experience . Such social bias can diminish BLV people’s motivation for creation , exclude them as target users for creative tool development , and limit opportunities for them to learn and get feedback on their creative skills for visual tasks : “The honest truth is that they ( videos and photos ) are more visual things , so when companies create editing software and apps , they’re not think - ing of maybe someone who can’t see would actually have a hobby or something to do with this , so they don’t make their software or app accessible for someone who does use a screen reader to operate . . . just because we can’t see the product , it doesn’t mean we don’t want to be participating” ( P2 ) . Some participants eventually developed less interest in certain inaccessible tasks—e . g . , “just don’t really have the interest of going into photo editing” ( P5 ) —and focused on a content format that is more accessible—e . g . , live streaming instead of edited videos (  = 4 ) . Compared to visual expression , participants in general practice audio expression more frequently and with more ease . The ma - jority of our participants ( 12 out of 15 ) mentioned accessibility workarounds with audio editing tools—for example , the BLV cre - ator community has continuously been developing plug - ins ( e . g . , “Osara” [ P5 ] ) and tutorial resources that our participants commonly use . Still , seven participants voiced the hope for more audio ex - pression possibilities : “I want to do more sound editing , like adding and mixing sounds for movies . . . as far as producing , I like to do in - strumental pieces , whether it’s classical or lof beats . . . I would like to write my own songs” ( P14 ) . Participants pointed out three main barriers towards achieve these expressive goals . The frst barrier is a lack of audio editing choices and features : “I just wish there were more and easier choices . . . A lot of companies like Apple and Google are doing pretty well with their ( accessible creative ) products , but most of their stuf is concentrating on phones and Ipads . . . and we really would like some of more professional programs to get accessible [ . . . ] even if they’re professional , they’re kind of outdated” ( P15 ) . Second is a lack of efcient and intuitive non - visual interfaces : “someone with vision can sit and watch an audio fle . . . we have to sit and re - listen to the audio completion . . . probably doubling that by the time we’d listen ! ” ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA Zhang , et al . ( P6 ) . Third is the learning curve and exposure—many participants were not aware of existing accessible audio production tools or perceived the tools to require high technical literacy (  = 12 ) . Social participation and responsibility : Last , some partici - pants felt that visually oriented digital content creation practices negatively impacted their opportunities for social participation and their ability to share accessible content with others . In regards to the former , seven participants mentioned concern around social exclusion or embarrassment caused by inappropriate creation of visual content . For example , P9 considered visual formatting impor - tant in forming social impressions and was especially concerned about refning it for the frst emails she sends to others . Some par - ticipants also found that the focus on vision in popular social media introduces barriers to their online participation : “Honestly even things like flters I don’t get . I have Instagram , but I don’t get to fully participate as much as I’d like to , because it’s not fully accessible” ( P2 ) , echoing past work on BLV social media creators ( e . g . , [ 10 , 77 ] ) . This desire to create visual content in forming bonds with others also came up in caring for sighted family members , such as P9 , who shared : “Because my son is sighted , he has to see it in order to learn this , so I should include things like pictures . Even though they wouldn’t matter to me , I see they matter for him” ( P9 ) . Finally , six participants described difculty with ensuring their own content is fully accessible to other disabled audiences . For example , P11 shared the challenge of inserting audio / video descriptions to make her videos accessible to BLV people : “With videos , if you’re gonna make it accessible , the other challenges you have to fgure out are where to insert the audio description” ( P11 ) . As another example , P7 experienced problems confguring the accessibility options when creating a survey . Summary : Overall , our participants shared a rich set of attitudes and reactions toward the visual focus of digital creation practices , ranging from asking for more alternative non - visual approaches , to accepting existing situations and adjusting to them through accessibility workarounds , to not engaging with inaccessible visual tasks (  = 10 for manipulating visual content ;  = 8 for operating visually oriented editing tools ) . Still , participants felt their creation needs were often not met and expressed hope for a more inclusive digital creation environment in the future . 4 . 2 . 2 Desired Areas of Improvement . In this section , we summarize our participants’ perspectives around how their digital content creation experiences could be improved . Accessibility awareness within digital creation realm : Firstly , participants collectively believed that accessibility awareness is still lacking in today’s digital creative industry . They argued for more inclusive expectations from society about BLV creators’ interests and capabilities as well as more opportunities for learning and working on diferent creative tasks , such as training for “the prepa - ration of visually attractive documents or presentation slides” ( P7 ) and BLV - inclusive photography workshops ( P6 ) . Participants ( N = 6 ) also commonly expressed the hope of “accessibility being actually talked about right in the forefront” ( P6 ) of all creative tools and these tools be accessible “out of the box and have accessibility be a key point” ( P6 ) instead of BLV creators having to retroft tools with accessibility workarounds , which greatly increases the on - boarding curve . When accessibility workarounds are necessary , our participants (  = 8 ) desired more related resources and a “roadmap” ( P6 ) for them to navigate these resources , such as “a stamp on a plugin to say : yes , this works with JAWS” ( P13 ) and “a collection of accessible editors that would be easy to fnd” ( P2 ) . Five participants further shared the desire to have a standardized , universal interface for creating specifc types of content across platforms , “so I wouldn’t have to fgure out each individual website” ( P1 ) . P7 proposed that the authoring tools should make the created content comply with accessibility guidelines by default , so that “you’d have to go out of your way to make non - compliant code” ( P7 ) , whereas P12 further argued that the creative tool companies should “get some of us on their development teams” ( P12 ) . Visual content evaluation and manipulation support : From the interview , we also learned that visual content evaluation and manipulation are critical to many BLV participants’ creation goals . Correspondingly , they proposed a number of ways to improve the accessibility of these tasks . First , the majority of them (  = 11 ) considered improvement on accuracy and usefulness of non - visual feedback for visual components a priority through “on - demand” ( P13 ) , “real time” ( P7 , P10 ) , and tactile feedback (  = 4 ) , echo - ing fndings from past work [ 37 , 43 , 81 , 96 ] . Adding to existing guidelines for image descriptions , we learned that besides objective descriptions to visual components ( e . g . , “colors” ( N = 8 ) , “font” ( N = 7 ) , “alignment” ( N = 9 ) ) , a high - level feedback about the overall visual formatting aesthetics and appropriateness could be helpful to BLV creators’ evaluation of visual content as well : “point out whether the formatting had a have a professional appearance , and , of course , whether things were correct in terms of of layout—not having too many spaces between words or any unexpected line breaks be - tween paragraphs” ( P7 ) . Accordingly , seven participants proposed to have a visual layout checker that is “the conceptually equivalent of a grammar checker” ( P7 ) , potentially through artifcial intelli - gence . Four participants additionally proposed to have tools that automatically make visual adjustments : “do some of those things automatically . . . helping with lighting or centering an object” ( P7 ) , po - tentially based on information the BLV creator provides : “fgure out where each picture would go and then put it in there , so it looks visually appealing” ( P9 ) . However , auto - generation of visual con - tent might not work for everyone . For example , P15 would prefer to “personalize the video” herself instead of “having the computer generate it” ( P15 ) . Advanced creative features : As presented in the previous sec - tions , many participants (  = 7 ) experienced challenges with and hoped for enhanced accessibility for advanced creative features , especially around audio and video editing control . For example , P2 would like to be able to non - visually confgure the “contrast” , “light - ing” , “blurriness” , and “flter” of videos he creates . P8 and P15 both hoped for more professional audio creation tools to be compatible with screen readers they make use of . Besides wanting simply an accessible version of these features , participants also wanted to improve the operation of these features , such as : “would be nice if there’s a way you could be more precise ” ( P12 ) . In turn , participants ( 7 out of 15 ) suggested incorporating physical control support , for example , to replace repeated key commands : “being able to phys - ically manipulate it and go up or down in volume however fast I want to go , it doesn’t sound like much , but that would save time” ( P5 ) . Similarly , P2 proposed to use a ”track bar” ( P2 ) to precisely control Understanding Digital Content Creation Needs of Blind and Low Vision People ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA and crop video clips : “ . . . put your fnger on the track bar and slide your fnger up , and that increases your spot in the video by like a few seconds or minutes . . . I feel like they should have something on the cropping part where you’re able to do that same thing” ( P2 ) . 5 DISCUSSION Through a mixed - method study that centers BLV creators’ lived experiences , we identifed factors critical to the fulfllment of our participants’ creative pursuits . We noted technical inaccessibility in their experiences with visually heavy creative tasks , which are re - inforced by ableist practices and expectations around BLV people’s creative capabilities and interests . Although some of these chal - lenges have been surfaced by prior work ( e . g . , [ 35 , 69 , 70 , 77 , 80 , 81 ] ) , our study contributes new insights around BLV people’s creative pursuits , related social considerations , and perspectives toward future accessibility support , while quantifying existing insights through a large scale survey . Based on these fndings , we discuss re - search and design implications to guide future research that shares the goal to support BLV creators . 5 . 1 Digital Creative Support Foci for BLV People One goal of our paper was to inform digital creative accessibility research to better align with the needs of the BLV creator com - munity . While we observed wide creative interests across diverse digital content types , our fndings specifcally call for accessibil - ity research attention on more diverse supports for visual content creation—accessible visual content authoring beyond straightfor - ward accessibility fxes and obligatory creation scenarios . As we learned in the study and as past work pointed out [ 27 , 35 , 81 ] , the evaluation of visual content and operation of visually oriented tools are two major barriers faced by BLV creators . With the heavy involvement of these two tasks , visual content , especially static visual and video content , are the most challenging types of digital content to create for BLV creators . Despite these inherent challenges , our study revealed a complex set of motivations from BLV people to engage with these visual creative tasks—a fact that , according to participants , often contradicts sighted people’s assump - tions . Participants shared how such biases lead to ableist practices and tool design that excluded them from fulflling their creative pursuits . For example , they often feel pressured to meet profes - sional and educational requirements with visual content creation , while not getting enough accessible directions and resources—a phenomena also noted in prior disability studies and accessibility literature [ 36 , 52 , 84 ] . Comparatively , although text - based and audio content creation are also commonly of interest to our participants , existing tooling for these tasks is largely already accessible , leaving a set of less urgent but still important accessibility issues . Refecting on existing accessibility research , visual creative task support for BLV people has recently gained momentum . So far , the visual content that has received the most attention is photog - raphy , often in the context of seeking visual interpretation ser - vices [ 2 , 27 , 31 , 37 , 89 ] . Several studies have also explored profes - sional and social visual content creation , mostly around presenta - tion slides [ 70 , 81 , 95 ] and social media videos [ 38 , 77 , 83 ] . While bringing constructive impacts , these studies still focus largely on providing accessibility support with the goal of producing con - tent that meets sighted practices . We argue that accessibility re - search should consider not only support for the mere completion of these visual creative tasks but also social considerations involved in diferent creation scenarios . Researchers have to date explored social aspects of accessible creative support in ( 1 ) mixed - ability collaboration [ 20 , 21 , 44 , 54 , 70 , 74 ] and ( 2 ) social media content cre - ation [ 10 , 38 , 82 ] . Adding to these considerations , our participants shared difculties around societal bias , visual - focused practices , and impression management . Future work should take into account these social factors to lead the digital creative environment toward a more inclusive and less sighted culture . Another area that existing accessibility research has paid less attention to is BLV people’s creation of visual content for artistic purposes and personal interest . Current visual creative support has an emphasis on scenarios where creation of visual content is a necessity , which has left out BLV people who have recreational in - terests in visual media authoring . Indeed , many participants shared the feeling of exclusion from more expressive personal visual con - tent creation . Learning from our participants’ perspectives , we call for future accessibility research to take these creative interests into account and address BLV creators’ varied reasons for engaging in visual content creation . 5 . 2 Role of Technology Design in Digital Creation Accessibility In this section , we detail potential technological ideas to achieve the creative support goals introduced in section 5 . 1 . Support control over visual content : In hope of gaining more con - trol over visual content they author , BLV participants proposed a range of potential tool improvements . Firstly , they desired improve - ments on visual content feedback , aligning with past research efort on image descriptions and multimodal support ( e . g . , [ 85 , 96 ] ) . Despite numerous explorations , there has not yet been a well - established guideline for presenting visual information in a creative context through verbal image descriptions or multimodal presenta - tions . For example , there could be more examinations of non - visual ways to convey common visual digital components ( e . g . , font , color , flter ) to support BLV people’s understanding of these components without superposing a high cognitive load . How to design non - visual interaction techniques for intuitive and efcient operation and navigation of editing interfaces is another open design question . Secondly , participants envisioned applying artifcial intelligence to automate parts of their visual content creation ( e . g . , automated description of visual formatting information , “grammar checker” for visual appeal , automatic visual content adjustments ) . Echoing past AI - based creative support research ( e . g . , [ 6 , 13 , 28 , 51 ] ) , we emphasize the importance of user control , especially given that the modality these tools produce in is inherently inaccessible to BLV creators . Designers should consider how to meaningfully convey accuracy of the algorithm and generated visual content to sup - port BLV creators’ sense of control [ 63 ] . Last , there could be more technology - mediated education opportunities for BLV and sighted people to learn from each others’ creative and aesthetic standards and strategies . Design for specifc creation scenarios : BLV people’s requirements for creative supports will also likely vary by context . For example , creators would likely desire diferent feedback when creating for artistic and personal expressions versus educational or professional requirements . In the former case , detailed explanation of aesthetic properties and visual meaning may be useful , though the same ASSETS ’23 , October 22 – 25 , 2023 , New York , NY , USA Zhang , et al . information may be deemed irrelevant in the latter case . As another example , participants in our study were particularly concerned about impression management in certain social scenarios , such as when preparing grant application materials and writing emails to someone important for the frst time . Consequently , they desired feedback on the visual appearance of their content ( e . g . , alignment , font , camera angle ) that otherwise may not be as important to them . In these scenarios , more detailed non - visual feedback or high - level confrmation related to the appropriateness of visual styling would help participants’ management of their content presentation and thus also self - image . Automated adjustments to visual formatting should also consider these social factors , such as by catering the formatting style based on how formal the scenario is . Future re - search should continue exploring diverse creation scenarios that involve other social and self - expression considerations to support BLV people’s personal thriving . Social change and limitations of technology : Technology alone will not and should not be expected to solve all access issues in the creative process . As mentioned in Section 5 . 1 , social bias is a persistent barrier faced by BLV creators . Deriving new technologies that better help BLV people meet sighted norms without question - ing or advocating for more inclusive expectations around creative output could inadvertently reinforce those norms . Given the var - ied user needs seen in our study , accessibility researchers should not only address straightforward accessibility problems but also how technology can help enact social change . In particular , rather than focusing purely on making visually heavy content creation more accessible , providing easy to use and widespread means for sighted people to learn about and consume non - visual content could help ease a transition to more inclusive content expectations in workplaces and educational settings . For example , if a blind screen reader user creates a document that can be shared in text but is also carefully designed to be consumed through audio , we can ease the process for a sighted person to consume this content through audio without burdening the creator or having to use an expert accessibility tool such as a screen reader . Lead of BLV creators : Potential technological advancement should center the leadership of BLV creators , as they are the domain ex - perts and the most impacted by these changes . Future research should explore ways to facilitate BLV people’s confguration and customization of mainstream creative tools for them to be more accessible . For example , there should be more infrastructure ( e . g . , customization options , forums ) to connect BLV creators’ ideas with creative tool developers , without requiring them to go through burdensome accessibility workarounds . We also encourage future studies to adopt community - based participatory research methods in innovating related technologies [ 32 ] . 5 . 3 Refection on Research Process and Limitations Here , we refect on a number of limitations of our study approach and execution . First , although we attempted to diversify our recruit - ment approach , most of our participants were from the NFB mailing list , which is a powerful tool to connect with a large number of BLV people but also poses the risk of biasing toward members’ experiences . Most of our participants ( 85 % of survey respondents and all of interview participants ) were also screen reader users , and therefore , their experience and perspectives may not fully apply to those who interact with digital creative tasks through remaining vision . In particular , while BLV creators who use other access tech - nologies may share some of the societal and access barriers with our participants , they would likely adopt a diferent set of strategies in navigating those barriers and may desire diferent technological support . We recommend future studies to also explore this broader set of experiences and perspectives . Second , given the diversity of creative backgrounds within the BLV community and varied interests from person to person , our study insights cannot cover perspectives from everyone in the BLV community . In particular , due to the exploratory nature of this study , we encouraged BLV people with all diferent backgrounds to take the survey , which meant that factors such as creation experiences and goals were not controlled and thus not suitable for statistical examination . We encourage future research to continue surveying the needs and perspectives of BLV individuals based on insights from our study , such as more systematically assessing the interaction between back - ground factors and needs for creation support . Third , all researchers on this project are sighted , and due to COVID - 19 restrictions at the time the research was conducted , there was a lack of in - feld , direct observation of BLV creators’ everyday creation experience . We therefore focus our analysis on BLV creators’ perspectives and attitudes . Future studies should consider engaging in - person studies with more opportunities for prolonged observations and partici - pant interactions ( e . g . , course program , workshops ) to gain more situated insights . Last , despite various measures taken to improve the validity of the survey responses , the self - reported nature of online surveys could bring inaccuracy , which should be taken into consideration when interpreting fndings from our paper . 6 CONCLUSION We conducted a mixed - method study to understand BLV people’s content creation needs and perspectives on how the digital creative process would beneft from accessibility research . Our fndings highlight the importance of research and design eforts to support more diverse creative tasks , including the evaluation and manipula - tion of diferent visual content and the operation of complex tools . More importantly , there is societal bias experienced by participants that reinforced ableist creative practices and the lack of accessibil - ity in creative tools . Based on ideas proposed by participants and prior accessibility research , we recommend the feld to consider technological design opportunities to support BLV creators’ self - expression , impression management and creation identity , as well as social inclusiveness of the broad digital creative environment .
