We have used a new method of image analysis to reconstruct actin ﬁlaments decorated with the actin - binding domain of utrophin , which contains two calponin homology domains . We ﬁnd two different modes of binding , with either one or two calponin - homology ( CH ) domains bound per actin subunit , and these modes are also distin - guishable by their very different effects on F - actin rigidity . Both modes involve an extended conformation of the CH domains , as predicted by a previous crystal structure . The U separation of these two modes has been largely dependent upon the use of our new approach to reconstruction of helical ﬁlaments . When existing information about tropomyosin , myosin , actin - depolymerizing factor , and nebulin is considered , these results suggest that many actin - binding proteins may have multiple binding sites on F - actin . The cell may use the modular CH domains found in the spectrin superfamily of actin - binding proteins to bind actin in manifold ways , allowing for complexity to arise from the interactions of a relatively few simple modules with actin . Introduction Utrophin is a large cytoskeletal protein that is part of the spectrin superfamily of actin - binding proteins . Members of this superfamily include dystrophin , spectrin , fimbrin , (cid:2) - actinin , filamin , and plectin , all containing an N - terminal actin - binding region composed of single or multiple copies of calponin - homology ( CH ) * domains . Utrophin ( 395 kD ) is expressed ubiquitously in humans , and is 69 % homologous to dystrophin ( 427 kD ) , the protein defective in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies . Both dystrophin and utrophin are thought to link the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix , and overexpression of utrophin has been shown to functionally replace dystrophin in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( Tinsley et al . , 1998 ) . Crystal structures exist for a number of actin - binding domains ( ABDs ) from proteins in this family , including fim - brin ( Goldsmith et al . , 1997 ) , dystrophin ( Norwood et al . , 2000 ) , and utrophin ( Keep et al . , 1999 ) . In each of these proteins , the ABDs contain tandem pairs of CH domains . We have used EM to examine complexes of F - actin with the ut261 fragment of utrophin ( Winder et al . , 1995 ) . A crystal structure of this fragment showed that the two CH domains were separated by an extended (cid:2) - helix , forming a dumbell ( Keep et al . , 1999 ) . This was in contrast to the compact con - formation of the two CH domains seen in the fimbrin crys - tal structure ( Goldsmith et al . , 1997 ) , leading Keep et al . ( 1999 ) to suggest that these actin - binding domains may be more flexible than was previously thought , and that utro - phin might bind to actin in this extended conformation . They proposed that domain reorganization may play a role in the actin - binding mechanism . We have applied a new method of image analysis of helical polymers based upon refinement of the local helical geometry ( Egelman , 2000 ) to these complexes . This method , iterative helical real space reconstruction ( IHRSR ) , provides an ex - ceptional ability to separate classes of polymorphic structures , and the previous application of this method to complexes of F - actin with actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) ( Galkin et Address correspondence to Edward H .

Results Electron micrographs show two different filament states af - ter the incubation of (cid:3) - actin filaments ( Fig . 1 A ) with the ut261 utrophin fragment ( Fig . 1 B ) . Relatively rigid fila - ments or segments of filaments can be seen ( Fig . 1 B , white arrow ) that appear different from undecorated filaments . But more massive , flexible filaments or segments of fila - ments ( Fig . 1 B , black arrow ) can also be seen . These mas - sive ( dark ) filaments are more likely to aggregate , whereas the light filaments are less likely to aggregate than the undec - orated control filaments . Under the conditions that we are using , we expect rather complete saturation of the actin by ut261 , as the binding constant that we measure for ut261 by cosedimentation is 7 . 1 (cid:4) 4 . 1 (cid:5) M with a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 ( unpublished data ) . These values are consistent with most previously published results ( Winder , 1996 ; Keep et al . , 1999 ; Moores and Kendrick - Jones , 2000 ; Zuellig et al . , 2000 ) , except Winder et al . ( 1995 ) , where a stoichiometry of 2 : 1 ( ut261 : actin ) was reported . Analysis of a total of (cid:2) 22 , 500 segments , each containing (cid:2) 14 actin subunits , revealed that three different populations could be found within the decorated filaments . These are two different modes of decoration by ut261 , and a third cat - egory which contained undecorated , partially decorated ac - tin , or disordered binding . The IHRSR approach ( Figs . 2 , 3 , and 4 ) was key to the separation of these modes , since con - ventional helical analysis ( DeRosier and Klug , 1968 ) would tend to average these states together . Although we find that there is a cooperativity in the mode of binding , as evidenced by the fact that different filament types can be differentiated by eye in electron micrographs ( Fig . 1 ) , detailed analysis shows that this cooperativity is far from complete . Two dif - ferent independent methods were employed to sort and clas - sify the filament segments used for three - dimensional recon - struction . One approach is based upon cross - correlations with projections of reference volumes ( Fig . 2 ) , whereas the second approach is based upon using differences in the two - dimensional radial density distributions within images for sorting ( Fig . 3 ) . An additional complication arises when looking at com - plexes of F - actin with other proteins , due to the large vari - ability in helical twist within F - actin ( Egelman et al . , 1982 ; Galkin et al . , 2001 ) . The IHRSR approach is also ideally suited to this problem , and independent reconstructions were generated for segments having actin symmetries from 154 (cid:6) to 174 (cid:6) , and stable solutions were found for mean symmetries of 159 (cid:6) , 162 (cid:6) , 164 (cid:6) , 166 (cid:6) , 168 (cid:6) , 170 (cid:6) , and 172 (cid:6) for the mode that we refer to as half - decoration . For the mode that we refer to as singly decorated , stable recon - structions were generated having mean actin symmetries of 161 (cid:6) and 166 (cid:6) . The most populated symmetry in both cases was that of 166 (cid:6) . Because the reconstructions did not differ significantly as a function of symmetry , only the 166 (cid:6) reconstructions are shown . Because the IHRSR method is based upon iterative convergence to a solution of defined structure and symmetry ( Egelman , 2000 ) , the final reconstructions shown are the stable results of many cycles of processing . Concerns about whether selfconsistent solutions are actually circular ones are addressed in Fig . 4 , where it is shown that if one starts the IHRSR method us - ing an atomic model of F - actin ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) fil - tered to low - resolution , resulting structures converge to the half - decorated reconstruction ( Fig . 4 , top ) and the single decorated reconstruction ( Fig . 4 , bottom ) after image seg - ments have been sorted . In the half - decorated mode ( Fig . 5 , B and E ) there is one compact density added to F - actin for every actin subunit in the filament , and this density ( Fig . 5 , B and E , black arrows ) is located between subdomain 2 of one actin subunit and subdomain 1 of the actin subunit above it on the same long - pitch helical strand . The location of this density is very simi - lar to what has been described for the binding of a fimbrin fragment to F - actin ( Hanein et al . , 1997 , 1998 ) . However , in contrast to that study , in which the density attributable to the fimbrin fragment was much weaker in the reconstruc - tion than that attributable to actin , we see the same peak density levels for both actin and the additional mass due to ut261 ( Fig . 5 E ) . We think that this results from the IHRSR single particle sorting , where a large number of segments Figure 1 .

The darkly stained filaments tend to aggregate extensively , whereas such aggregation is not seen with the lightly stained filaments .

In the singly decorated mode , there are two additional compact densities per actin subunit ( Fig . 5 , C and F , red and blue arrows ) , and these are connected by a single bridge of density ( Fig . 5 C ) . In contrast to the half - decorated mode ( Fig . 5 , B and E ) in which the binding of ut261 only appears to induce a closing of the nucleotide - binding cleft in actin , there are changes in subdomains 3 and 4 and in the C termi - nus of actin in the singly decorated state ( Fig . 5 , C and F ) . Unlike previous EM observations that could be interpreted in terms of a simple rotation of subdomain 2 ( Egelman , 2001a ) , a reasonable understanding of what is happening to actin in this state will require higher resolution studies . We have used the crystal structure of ut261 ( Keep et al . , 1999 ) to interpret both binding modes . The singly deco - rated state is most readily interpreted since the two masses per actin subunit can be simply fit by the crystal structure , with each CH domain filling a globular additional density in the reconstruction and the (cid:2) - helical connector in the crystal occupying the bridge region in the reconstruction ( Fig . 6 B ) . However , in order to properly fit the globular domains , a ro - tation of the CH2 domain by (cid:2) 110 (cid:6) away from its position relative to CH1 found in the crystal structure was required ( Fig . 6 D ) . Support for this reorientation comes from the fact that when using only shape as a guide in fitting the ut261 crystal structure into the reconstruction , the proposed actin - binding surfaces in both CH1 and CH2 identified by Keep et al . ( Fig . 6 B , yellow ribbon segments ) are now ori - ented facing actin . We find that the half - decorated state can be explained by one ut261 fragment binding to two actin subunits ( Fig . 6 Figure 2 . A schematic diagram illustrating how the IHRSR method was used to sort the filament images into three class : half - decorated , singly decorated , and poor or mixed decoration . An electron micrograph ( top , center ) shows a typical field of filaments , and from these , 16 , 070 segments were extracted from filaments identified as light ( white arrow ) , and 6 , 240 segments were extracted from filaments identified as dark ( black arrow ) . Five examples of such segments are shown for each set . Two initial three - dimensional reconstructions were then generated from (cid:2) 2 , 000 segments from each set and yielded a mean symmetry of both sets of (cid:2) 166 (cid:6) ( in this instance , the variable twist of F - actin was averaged ) . A third reconstruction , of pure F - actin , was taken from previously published work ( Orlova et al . , 2001 ) . These initial reconstructions were clearly distinguish - able from each other and from pure F - actin , but suffered from inhomogeneity of decoration , mixture of modes , and variable twist . The next step was to gen - erate reference projections from these three - dimensional volumes for sorting . The light segments were then cross - correlated against projections of both pure F - actin and the light reconstruction , whereas the dark segments were cross - correlated against projections of both the light and dark reconstructions . Although only two reference projections are shown for each case , in actuality , 90 reference projections were generated for each symmetry ( corresponding to azimuthal rotations of 4 (cid:6) about the helical axis ) , and actin symmetries from 154 (cid:6) to 174 (cid:6) in 2 (cid:6) increments were used . Thus , the 16 , 070 light segments and the 6 , 240 dark segments were each cross - correlated against 1 , 980 reference projections . This then yielded a sorting of segments by both twist and decoration . New reconstructions were then iteratively generated using IHRSR for all classes , including poorly , half - and singly decorated subsets showing different symmetries . The largest subsets for all classes had a final symmetry of (cid:2) 166 (cid:6) , and reconstructions from these subsets are shown at the bottom . For the segments initially collected from light filaments , (cid:2) 38 % ( 6 , 155 out of 16 , 070 ) showed stronger correlation with pure F - actin than they did to the half - decorated reconstruction . For the segments initially collected from dark filaments , (cid:2) 50 % ( 3 , 079 out of 6 , 240 ) showed stronger correlation with the half decoration than they did to the singly decorated reconstruction . These percentages cannot be interpreted in terms of stoichiometries or incomplete binding , since we are sorting primarily on ordered binding rather than actual occupancy . on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 246 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 157 , Number 2 , 2002 gether , resulting in an identical mass bound to each actin subunit . Attempts were made to reduce the symmetrization of the reconstruction procedure ( making the asymmetric re - peating unit in the structure four actin subunits rather than one ) to see if different densities could be seen for CH1 and CH2 , but were unsuccessful . This may be partly due to the fact that at (cid:2) 22 Å resolution the CH1 and CH2 domains are similar . More importantly , the binding in this mode may be rather random with respect to the relative phasing of the CH1 and CH2 domains on the two actin long - pitch strands . As with the singly decorated state , a rotation of the CH2 domain by (cid:2) 145 (cid:6) from the crystal position was also required to fit the reconstruction . However , a different rota - tion was needed , as shown in Fig . 6 D . The breaking of reg - ular secondary structure in the linker region between the two compact CH domains seen in the ut261 crystal struc - ture suggested to Keep et al . ( 1999 ) that this linker region was flexible and might allow domain reorganization . In fact , a crystal structure of the homologous ( 72 % sequence iden - tity ) ABD from dystrophin ( Norwood et al . , 2000 ) revealed a large rotation of the two CH domains with respect to each Figure 3 . Sorting of images based on projected density . Image segments were initially aligned ( shifted in x and y , and rotated in plane ) against reference projections of a pure F - actin reconstruction ( Orlova et al . , 2001 ) . Segments with shifts of (cid:7) 5 pixels , or with rotations from 0 (cid:6) or 180 (cid:6) greater than 10 (cid:6) were discarded . This reduced the 16 , 070 light segments to 11 , 698 , and reduced the 6 , 240 dark segments to 3 , 533 . The projected density within columns of pixels corresponding to a particular radial band was then integrated . This radial band was 40 – 56 Å from the helical axis for the light segments A , and 45 – 55 Å from the helical axis for the dark segments B . These radial limits were chosen based upon analysis of where the greatest differences occurred from pure F - actin , and these bands are indicated by the bars under the inset images ( A and B ) . The resulting histograms of density within these radial bands are shown for the light segments A and the dark segments B . Images were then sorted into groups based upon this density distribution . Reconstructions are shown for four groups in A : # 1 , n (cid:8) 858 , density from 11 to 40 ; # 2 , n (cid:8) 4 , 369 , density from 41 to 60 ; # 3 , n (cid:8) 1 , 396 , density from 81 to 100 ; and # 4 , n (cid:8) 694 , density from 91 to 110 . The red arrows indicate the feature due to the bound ut261 that becomes progressively stronger from # 1 to # 3 . However , in # 4 , a new feature appears ( blue arrow ) that is due to the second mode of binding , showing that the segments initially selected as light are predominantly the half - bound complex ( Fig . 4 ) , but contain some regions with single decoration . The same approach was done for the dark segments , which have been divided into three groups in ( B ) : # 1 , n (cid:8) 767 , density from 21 to 60 ; # 2 , n (cid:8) 1 , 811 , density from 61 to 100 ; # 3 , n (cid:8) 721 , density from 101 to 140 . It can be seen that the dark segments contain both modes of binding , as group # 1 can be explained quite well by the half decoration , whereas only group # 3 shows the saturated single binding that we interpret ( Fig . 6 ) as CH1 ( red arrow ) and CH2 ( blue arrow ) . Figure 4 . Results of the IHRSR method can be seen for singly decorated ( bottom ) and half - decorated filament segments ( top ) . An atomic model of F - actin ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) has been filtered to low resolution ( left ) , and this is used as the starting point for sub - sequent cycles of the procedure . Images of filament segments , each containing about 14 actin subunits , have been sorted based upon both differences in twist and in the binding of ut261 ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . The morphing of the half decorated filaments from the starting actin model ( left ) during this procedure is shown after 2 , 5 , and 10 cycles using 1 , 396 filament segments . The green arrow indicates the single density due to ut261 that emerges . For the 772 segments classified as singly decorated , a stable solution requires more iterations . The results after 5 , 10 , and 20 cycles are shown . The blue arrow indicates the density that we have interpreted as being due to CH2 ( Fig . 6 ) . A ) , so that the single additional mass seen per actin subunit is either a CH1 or CH2 domain . In the three - dimensional reconstructions , these two domains will be averaged to - on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Utrophin actin - binding domain | Galkin et al . 247 other in comparison with what was seen in the utrophin ABD ( Fig . 6 D ) . In models for both the single - and half - binding modes , steric clashes exist between the DNase I - binding loop within subdomain 2 of actin and ut261 . This loop has been shown to be capable of folding either as a (cid:3) - strand ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) or (cid:2) - helix ( Otterbein et al . , 2001 ) , and was not even visualized in one crystal structure due to large disorder ( McLaughlin et al . , 1993 ) . Thus , this loop is quite plastic and could be easily shifted in the actin - ut261 complex . In - terestingly , the clash that is observed is entirely a function of which crystal structure of G - actin is used in the model of the complex . The crystal structure of the closed form of (cid:3) - actin was used ( Schutt et al . , 1993 ) , as the actin in the filament appears to have a closed nucleotide - binding pocket . How - ever , if the actin structure is replaced by the open state struc - ture of (cid:3) - actin ( Chik et al . , 1996 ) , aligning subdomain 1 , Figure 5 . Surfaces ( A – C ) and cross - sections ( D – F ) of reconstructions from pure (cid:3) - actin ( A and D ) , half - decorated filaments ( B and E ) , and singly decorated filaments ( C and F ) . The half decoration corresponds to one utrophin ABD ( containing the two CH domains , labeled CH1 , and CH2 ) per two actin subunits , whereas the single decoration corresponds to one utrophin ABD for each actin subunit ( Fig . 6 ) . The actin subdomains 1 – 4 are labeled ( A and B ) , with sub - domains 1 and 2 from a different actin subunit labeled as 1 (cid:9) and 2 (cid:9) . In D , subdomains 2 and 4 come from a subunit on the opposite strand , and are labeled 2 (cid:9) and 4 (cid:9) , respectively . The nucleotide - binding cleft in the pure (cid:3) - actin ( * ) , opens up with respect to the structure of the (cid:2) - actin - ATP subunit ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) used for the starting model ( Fig . 4 ) . In contrast , this cleft appears to be closed in both the half - decorated ( B , * ) and singly decorated state ( C ) . In the half - decorated mode , the additional mass that is seen associated with each actin subunit is an average of both CH1 and CH2 , as only one of these can be bound at each site . The surfaces corre - spond to 100 % of the expected molecular volume for pure actin ( A ) , one ut261 fragment for every two actins ( B ) , and one ut261 for every actin ( C ) . there is no longer any steric clash at subdomain 2 ( unpub - lished data ) . However , a clash now appears at the N termi - nus of actin , which did not exist using the closed actin sub - unit . We know from spectroscopic and structural studies that actin’s N terminus is highly mobile ( Orlova et al . , 1994 ; Heintz et al . , 1996 ) . Thus , models for the actin - ut261 inter - action are quite reasonable with respect to steric clashes when the internal dynamics of actin are taken into consider - ation . Although it might be possible that very large distor - tions of both actin and ut261 occur such that similar con - tacts ( with the exception of the subdomain 4 contact involving residues 228 – 235 ) are conserved between the two proteins in the two modes of binding , we think this unlikely due to the large distortions that would be needed . However , this question needs to be addressed in future studies . Alternate explanations were considered for the half bind - ing mode . The simplest is that there is some fraction of the ut261 protein that contains only one CH domain due to proteolysis . This possibility can be eliminated , as SDS - PAGE shows that ut261 runs as a single band ( unpublished data ) . Another possibility is that the binding has the same stoichiometry as in the single decoration , but that the sec - ond CH domain is disordered , and therefore not seen in the reconstruction . There are three reasons to reject this possi - bility . First , such a binding would involve additional mass along the outside of the actin filament , even if this mass was disordered and therefore not seen in the reconstruction . Analysis of the radial density in images shows that such addi - tional mass does not exist in this mode . It can clearly be seen that there is more projected density at high radius in the dark raw images ( Fig . 3 B ) than in the light raw images ( Fig . 3 A ) . If the binding of the second CH domain was disorderd in the light filaments , it would still contribute to the pro - jected density but not contribute to the reconstructions . In addition , we show that there is a direct correlation between the projected density at high radius and the strength of the second CH domain ( Fig . 3 , blue arrows ) . Second , there is a clear difference in the rigidity of the decorated filaments between the two modes of binding . We have previously shown that modifications to subdomain 2 can introduce large changes in the rigidity of actin filaments ( Orlova and Egelman , 1993 ; Orlova et al . , 2001 ) , consistent with the fact that the highest radius inter - subunit contact in the filament involves subdomain 2 , and that the flexural ri - gidity of a filament depends upon the fourth power of the radial mass distribution . The orientation of CH1 with re - spect to actin is different in the two modes . If the binding of CH1 was the same between the two modes , we would ex - pect to see the same rigidity in both states . In fact , we would expect to see an even greater rigidity in the singly decorated mode , where both CH domains are bound in an ordered manner to F - actin . But we actually see a much greater rigid - ity in the half - binding mode , consistent with different spe - cific attachments between the two modes of the CH domain located in the cleft between subdomain 2 and subdomain 1 of a subunit above it . Third , aggregation is seen only in the singly decorated mode , most likely caused by interactions between the CH2 domains on different filaments that are more weakly bound than the CH1 domains . If the binding in the half - decorated on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 248 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 157 , Number 2 , 2002 Figure 6 . The crystal structure of the utrophin ABD ( Keep et al . , 1999 ) can be used to completely explain both modes of binding observed . The half decoration ( A ) can be fit with one ABD for every two actin subunits along the same long - pitch helical strand . In this mode of binding , there is either a CH1 or CH2 domain bound to every actin subunit , and the density in the reconstruction additional to actin results from an average of both the CH1 and the CH2 domains . The binding in this mode is between subdomain 2 of one subunit and subdomain 1 of the subunit above it on the same long pitch strand . In the single - decoration mode ( B ) , there is one ABD bound to each actin subunit . The actin - binding surfaces of utrophin ( Keep et al . , 1999 ) are shown in yellow . In B , three of the inserts in the actin sequence that are not present in bacterial MreB ( Egelman , 2001b ; van den Ent et al . , 2001 ) are shown in red . These inserts are residues 40 – 48 ( subdomain 2 , DNase I - binding loop ) , 228 – 235 ( subdomain 4 ) , and 353 – 375 ( subdomain 1 , C terminus ) . Each is involved in a contact with the utrophin ABD . The 40 – 48 and 353 – 375 inserts appear to be involved in both modes of binding . In contrast , the 228 – 235 insert makes a contact with the CH2 domain of an ABD , whose CH1 domain is bound to an actin subunit on the opposite strand ( black arrows ) . The surface in B is at 140 % of the expected molecular volume to show these contacts , but the model fits extremely well at 100 % volume . Steric clashes exist between the DNase I - binding loop of actin’s subdomain 2 and CH1 in B , and both CH1 and CH2 in A . An extensive literature on the mobility of this loop ( Egelman , 2001a ) suggests that it might be repositioned in the complex . The regions in actin that are likely to be involved in contacts with utrophin are shown in either green ( 223 – 230 ) or red ( C ) . Both models for utrophin binding ( A and B ) involve relative domain shifts between CH1 and CH2 of the utrophin ABD from the crystal structure ( Keep et al . , 1999 ) . The shifts of the CH2 domains that have been used are shown in D , where the unperturbed on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Utrophin actin - binding domain | Galkin et al . 249 state involved a free CH domain dangling from the actin fil - ament , we would expect to see an even greater extent of ag - gregation in this state . Discussion Using a novel approach to three - dimensional reconstruction of helical filaments ( Egelman , 2000 ) , we have been able to observe two different modes of binding of the utrophin ABD to F - actin involving two different stoichiometries . The use of this approach has been rather essential , as disorder in binding , the mixing of modes , and the variable twist of F - actin ( Egelman et al . , 1982 ) would tend to obscure the three - dimensional structure of these complexes using traditional helical methods of image analysis . A similar application of this method to complexes of actin with ADF was able to dis - cern two different modes of binding of ADF to F - actin ( Galkin et al . , 2001 ) , also involving two different stoichiom - etries . The application of the method to complexes of actin with a nebulin fragment has led to the first visualization of the interaction between nebulin and F - actin ( Lukoyanova et al . , 2002 ) , and this was only possible after most filament seg - ments were discarded during the cycles of image processing due to disorder or incomplete binding . The method has been extensively tested , as applications to protein - DNA fila - ments active in recombination have also been very successful ( Yang et al . , 2001a , b ; Yu et al . , 2001 ) . In both modes , we observe that the utrophin ABD is bound in an extended conformation , as predicted by the crystallographic study of Keep et al . ( 1999 ) . A previous EM study of actin complexed with the same ut261 construct also suggested an extended conformation of the two CH do - mains ( Moores et al . , 2000 ) . Unfortunately , we find little re - lation between our interpretation of the additional mass that we see bound to actin and what was presented in that paper . Comparison of our half - decorated reconstruction with their work suggests that the polarity used for their ut261 - deco - rated filament with respect to undecorated actin was upside down . Further , it is likely that the two different modes of binding that we observe were present in their decorated fila - ments , and these were not separated during the reconstruc - tion procedure . We have shown that the putative actin - binding surfaces of utrophin ( Keep et al . , 1999 ) face actin when the crystal structure is oriented into the EM reconstructions . What can be said about the complementary utrophin - binding surfaces of actin ? Fig . 6 C highlights the actin residues that we see in - volved in the interactions with ut261 . Our results are in gen - eral agreement with the identification of residues in subdo - mains 1 and 2 of actin that were suggested to be involved in the binding of fimbrin ( Hanein et al . , 1998 ) . Is it possible that the two modes of binding are an artifact due to the fact that only the actin - binding domain of utro - phin has been used , and not the intact protein ? This cannot be answered unequivocally until structural studies are done with the full - length molecule . Nevertheless , the results show the plasticity in CH domain rearrangements predicted by Keep et al . ( 1999 ) based in part upon the comparison be - tween crystal structures of the utrophin , dystrophin ( Nor - wood et al . , 2000 ) and fimbrin ( Goldsmith et al . , 1997 ) ABD’s . Thus , we think it unlikely that this plasticity will no longer exist in the full - length molecule . The recent determination of a structure for the bacterial MreB protein showed that it is an actin homologue ( van den Ent et al . , 2001 ) , and provides a framework for understand - ing the prokaryotic origin of actin - based motility , the cy - toskeleton , and muscle . Interestingly , there are six sequence inserts that appear in all eukaryotic actins that are absent in MreB ; five of these appear to be involved in the subunit – subunit contacts that hold F - actin together , and at least three of these are involved in allosteric couplings within ac - tin ( Egelman , 2001b ) . It is noteworthy that many interac - tions with actin - binding proteins also appear to involve these inserts . We see that residues 40 – 48 , which form the DNase I - binding loop within subdomain 2 and are an insert not present in MreB , are strongly involved in contacts with ut261 . The residues 228 – 235 , another insert in the actin se - quence not present in MreB , form a helix that protrudes from subdomain 4 ( Fig . 6 B , red residues ) , and this helix is likely to be involved in the interaction with the CH2 do - main that is attached to a CH1 domain bound to an actin subunit on the opposite long - pitch helical strand ( Fig . 6 B , black arrows ) . A third insert in actin that is not present in MreB is the C terminus , containing residues 353 – 375 , and this is also involved in contacts with ut261 in both modes of binding . The reconstruction of a complex between F - actin and myosin light chain kinase suggested that residues 228 – 232 of one subunit and residues 364 – 375 from a subunit on the opposite long - pitch helical strand were involved in the contact region with myosin light chain kinase ( Hatch et al . , 2001 ) , and these involve two of the three actin inserts that we see making contact with ut261 . The reconstructions of the two different modes of bind - ing , and the fit of the ut261 crystal structure to these com - plexes , suggests that the utrophin ABD can make different interactions with actin that involve multiple surfaces on the actin subunit . We have previously shown that ADF can also bind F - actin in two different modes , using multiple non - overlapping binding surfaces on actin ( Galkin et al . , 2001 ) . An extensive literature exists about multiple binding posi - tions of tropomyosin to F - actin ( Lehman et al . , 2000 ; Craig and Lehman , 2001 ) , and other observations have shown that the weak ( in the presence of ATP ) and rigor ( in the absence of nucleotide ) binding of myosin to F - actin must involve different residues in actin ( DasGupta and Reisler , 1989 , 1991 , 1992 ) . The binding of a nebulin fragment to F - actin involves three different sites on actin ( Lukoyanova et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , a picture emerges that in addition to being able to bind a large number of other proteins , many proteins can bind to multiple sites on actin . This may provide addi - crystal structure is in green , the fit to the half - decorated state is in yellow ( (cid:2) 145 (cid:6) rotation from crystal structure ) , and the fit to the singly decorated state is in blue ( (cid:2) 110 (cid:6) rotation from the crystal structure ) , after the CH1 domains have been aligned . The magnitude of these shifts is similar to what is observed when the homologous ABD from dystrophin ( Norwood et al . , 2000 ) , shown in red , is aligned with the CH1 from utrophin . on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 250 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 157 , Number 2 , 2002 tional insight into the remarkable conservation of actin’s se - quence and structure over the course of eukaryotic evolution ( Egelman , 2001a ) , as the selective pressure against muta - tions in actin will grow considerably when multiple interac - tions become important . In addition , our results provide new insight into the mod - ular architecture of the CH domains present in a superfam - ily of actin - binding proteins , and support the notion that a large degree of polymorphism may be present in the binding of these proteins to F - actin due to the ability of these do - mains to bind in multiple ways . Materials and methods Specimen preparation and EM (cid:3) - actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton , Inc . Lyophilized powder was dissolved in 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 05 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , and clarified by centrifugation in TLX - Beckman centrifuge for 30 min at 75 , 000 g . G - Ca 2 (cid:10) - actin was converted to G - Mg 2 (cid:10) - actin by incubation for 6 min at room temperature in the presence of 0 . 02 mM EGTA and 0 . 02 mM MgCl 2 . G - Mg 2 (cid:10) - actin was diluted to 5 (cid:5) M by 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 8 , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and polymerized by the addition of 0 . 1 M KCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 . The utrophin ut261 fragment was expressed and purified as previ - ously described ( Moores and Kendrick - Jones , 2000 ) . For EM samples , F - Mg 2 (cid:10) - (cid:3) - actin ( 2 (cid:5) M ) was mixed with ut261 ( 22 (cid:5) M ) , and incubated 30 – 40 min on ice . Samples ( 6 – 7 (cid:5) l ) were applied to carbon - coated grids and negatively stained with 2 % ( wt / vol ) uranyl acetate . A Technai - 12 elec - tron microscope was used at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV , at a nomi - nal magnification of 30 , 000 (cid:11) . Negatives were densitometered with a Leaf 45 scanner , using a raster of 3 . 9 Å / pixel . Image processing Most of the methodology is described in Figs . 2 – 4 , as well as in Galkin et al . ( 2001 ) . Segments were cut from the light filaments as 40 (cid:11) 100 pixel boxes , and cut from the dark filaments as 50 (cid:11) 100 pixel boxes . These were padded to 100 (cid:11) 100 pixels for most subsequent processing . Two control reconstructions for undecorated F - actin were used . An initial re - construction was a previously published low - resolution structure of yeast F - actin ( Orlova et al . , 2001 ) . Because the ut261 - actin complexes involved cytoplasmic (cid:3) - actin , a second control reconstruction of pure (cid:3) - actin was generated from 6 , 725 segments . A subset containing 1 , 490 images of pure (cid:3) - actin had a final symmetry after 34 IHRSR cycles of 165 . 8 (cid:6) , and was very similar to the yeast actin reconstruction . The resolution of the reconstruc - tions was determined by generating two independent reconstructions from each data set , and comparing these using either the 0 . 5 criterion for the Fourier shell correlation or the 3 (cid:12) criterion ( in parentheses ) . The values found were 27 Å ( 21 Å ) for the pure (cid:3) - actin , 27 Å ( 22 Å ) for the half - deco - rated , and 33 Å ( 23 Å ) for the singly decorated . Comparisons with atomic models suggested that all reconstructions had a resolution of (cid:2) 22 Å , and that the 3 (cid:12) criterion provided a more accurate estimate . Model building Crystal structures for both the closed - ( Schutt et al . , 1993 ) and open - cleft ( Chik et al . , 1996 ) conformations of (cid:3) - actin and of the utrophin ABD ( Keep et al . , 1999 ) were used to generate low - resolution surfaces . Dimerization of two ABDs in the crystal resulted in a compact association between the CH1 domain of one monomer and the CH2 domain of the other monomer . This compact structure contains the same CH domain interface seen in the fimbrin crystal structure ( Goldsmith et al . , 1997 ) . We first attempted to fit both the extended and compact conformations of the utrophin ABD ob - served in the crystal structure into the reconstructions . Neither provided a good fit to either the half - or singly - decorated reconstruction . The CH1 and CH2 domains of utrophin were then treated independently . Using shape as our primary guide , these surfaces were docked by eye into the EM recon - structions of the half - and singly decorated actin complexes . Transforma - tions used in docking the surfaces were then applied to the atomic struc - ture coordinates , followed by the imposition of helical symmetry to generate filament models . In both the half - and singly decorated models , the G - actin structure with the closed cleft fit better to the three - dimen - sional reconstructions . However , in the control (cid:3) - actin reconstruction , the open conformation of the actin subunit provided the best fit . Residues 227 – 238 and 244 – 248 in subdomain 4 of actin penetrate the EM surface envelope in the single - decorated map , and subdomain 4 is directly in - volved in contacts with a utrophin fragment from the opposite strand . In the half - decorated reconstruction , subdomain 4 has no contact with utro - phin and these residues lie within the EM surface envelope .
