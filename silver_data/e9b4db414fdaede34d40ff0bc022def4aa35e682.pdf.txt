We identiﬁed a novel adaptor protein that contains a Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain , SH3 binding proline - rich sequences , and a leucine zipper - like motif and termed this protein WASP interacting SH3 protein ( WISH ) . WISH is expressed predominantly in neural tissues and testis . It bound Ash / Grb2 through its proline - rich regions and neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome pro - tein ( N - WASP ) through its SH3 domain . WISH strongly enhanced N - WASP – induced Arp2 / 3 complex activation independent of Cdc42 in vitro , resulting in rapid actin polymerization . Furthermore , coexpression of WISH and N - WASP induced marked formation of microspikes in Cos7 cells , even in the absence of stimuli . An N - WASP mutant ( H208D ) that cannot bind Cdc42 still induced microspike formation when coexpressed with WISH . We also examined the contribution of WISH to a rapid actin polymerization induced by brain extract in vitro . Arp2 / 3 complex was essential for brain extract – induced rapid actin polymerization . Addition of WISH to extracts increased actin polymerization as Cdc42 did . However , WISH unexpectedly could activate actin poly - merization even in N - WASP – depleted extracts . These ﬁndings suggest that WISH activates Arp2 / 3 complex through N - WASP – dependent and – independent path - ways without Cdc42 , resulting in the rapid actin poly - merization required for microspike formation . Key words : N - WASP • Arp2 / 3 complex • Ash / Grb2 • microspike formation Introduction Ash / Grb2 is an adaptor protein composed of one central Src homology ( SH ) 1 2 domain and two flanking SH3 do - mains ( Lowenstein et al . , 1992 ; Matuoka et al . , 1992 ) . The SH2 domain of Ash / Grb2 receives signals from several up - stream target proteins including EGF receptor ( Lowen - stein et al . , 1992 ; Matuoka et al . , 1992 ) , PDGF receptor ( Arvidsson et al . , 1994 ) , Shc ( Rozakis - Adcock et al . , 1992 ) , and insulin receptor 1 ( IRS1 ) ( Baltensperger et al . , 1993 ) through binding to the specific phosphotyrosine - containing motif on the target protein . Signals received at the SH2 domain are transmitted downstream through SH3 domain binding proteins . A recent study has shown that the SH3 domains of Ash / Grb2 bind to a variety of proline - rich proteins including Sos ( Rozakis - Adcock et al . , 1993 ; Simon et al . , 1993 ) , synaptojanin ( McPherson et al . , 1996 : Sakisaka et al . , 1997 ) , dynamin ( Gout et al . , 1993 ; Miki et al . , 1994 ) , c - Cbl ( Meisner and Czech , 1995 ) , Abl ( Feller et al . , 1994 ) , Ack ( Manser et al . , 1995 ; Satoh et al . , 1996 ; Yang and Cerione , 1997 ) , and neural Wiskott - Aldrich syn - drome protein ( N - WASP ) ( Miki et al . , 1996 , 1998a ) . Thus , Ash / Grb2 appears to play important roles not only in mi - togenic signaling through Ras activation but also in the re - organization of actin filaments and endocytosis . It is already well known that the Rho family of small G protein , including Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 , act as molecular switches by cycling between the active GTP - bound and the inactive GDP - bound states to regulate the actin cytoskele - ton ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . Rho primarily regulates de - velopment of actin stress fibers ; Rac stimulates formation of lamellipodia or membrane ruffling ; and Cdc42 induces the formation of filopodia ( Hall , 1998 ) . Downstream signals from Ash / Grb2 are found to “cross - talk” with these G proteins , resulting in reorganiza - tion of the actin cytoskeleton . Indeed , N - WASP , an Ash / Grb2 binding protein , induces filopodium formation that is dependent on Cdc42 ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 152 , 2001 472 sesses a GTPase - binding domain / Cdc42 / Rac interactive binding region ( GBD / CRIB ) motif through which N - WASP binds directly to the active form of Cdc42 ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) . We have also shown that the verprolin ho - mology domain ( V ) of N - WASP , which is an actin binding site , is essential for filopodium formation ( Miki and Tak - enawa , 1998 ) , and the cofilin - like domain ( C ) and acidic ( A ) region in the COOH terminus of N - WASP are Arp2 / 3 complex binding sites ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , it has been shown that Arp2 / 3 complex is markedly acti - vated by the verplorin homology , cofilin homology , and acidic region ( VCA ) region of N - WASP . This is the mini - mal essential region for the activation of Arp2 / 3 complex . However , the full - length N - WASP protein was found to be a less potent activator of Arp2 / 3 complex than the VCA protein , suggesting that the VCA region is masked in the full - length protein and is exposed by interaction with other activating factors . Thus far , addition of Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) has been shown to increase the activity of full - length N - WASP to the level induced by VCA protein ( Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) . Recently , other VCA region – containing proteins have been identified and named WASP family verplorin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) / Scar ( Miki et al . , 1998b ; Su - etsugu et al . , 1999 ) . WAVEs appear to function down - stream of Rac and induce membrane ruffling . Thus , it has been made clear that WASP and WAVE family proteins can bind and activate Arp2 / 3 complex through the VCA region , resulting in rapid actin polymerization . In this study , we identified a novel Ash / Grb2 bind - ing protein that contains an SH3 domain , SH3 binding proline - rich sequences , and a leucine zipper - like motif . We named this protein WASP interacting SH3 protein ( WISH ) , because WISH binds N - WASP through its SH3 domain . In addition , we demonstrate that WISH further enhances N - WASP – induced Arp2 / 3 complex activation independent of Cdc42 in vitro . Furthermore , coexpression of WISH and N - WASP induces marked formation of mi - crospikes in Cos7 cells even in the absence of stimuli , and an N - WASP mutant ( H208D ) that cannot bind Cdc42 also induced microspike formation when coexpressed with WISH . Using N - WASP – depleted brain extracts , we also showed that WISH has an alternative route in addition to the route via N - WASP , to activate Arp2 / 3 complex in brain extract – induced rapid actin polymerization . Materials and Methods Glutathione S - Transferase Fusion Proteins Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - Ash / Grb2 ( Miki et al . , 1994 ) , GST - AshN , GST - AshC ( Watanabe et al . , 1995 ) , GST - phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI 3 - kinase ) 85 - kD subunit ( p85 ) SH3 ( Shibasaki et al . , 1993 ) , PLC g 1 SH3 ( Homma et al . , 1990 ) , GST - Nck SH3 ( Matuoka and Tak - enawa , 1998 ) , GST - Fyn SH3 ( Miki et al . , 1999 ) , and GST - CA ( Miki and Takenawa , 1998 ) were purified as described . Bacterial expression plas - mids coding various GST fusion proteins of WISH were produced by in - frame insertion of fragments corresponding to each region as shown in Fig . 4 C into pGEX plasmids ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . GST - SH3 ( 1 – 132 amino acids ) expression plasmid was made by cutting the cDNA of mouse WISH , and inserting it into pGEX - 4T - 3 . GST - Pro ( 132 – 268 amino acids ) , GST - Mid ( 240 – 442 amino acids ) , and GST - Leu ( 442 – 611 amino acids ) were produced by in - frame insertion of a PCR - amplified fragment corresponding to each sequence into the BamHI - EcoRI site of pGEX - 2T . GST - C ( 611 – 711 amino acids ) was produced by in - frame insertion of a PCR - amplified fragment into the BamHI - XhoI site of pGEX - 4T - 1 . The recombinant plasmids were transformed into XL - I Blue strain Esch - erichia coli and induced to express GST fusion proteins with IPTG . The bacteria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in E . coli lysis buffer ( 40 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM di - isopropyl fluorophosphate , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . Vigorous sonication was performed before centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 30 min . The resulting supernatants were stored as crude extracts containing GST fusion pro - teins . GST - Cdc42 and GST – N - WASP proline - rich region ( GST – NW - Pro , 265 – 391 amino acids ) was expressed in Sf9 cells using recombinant bacu - loviruses , which were produced using the BAC - TO - BAC system ( GIBCO BRL ) . They were mixed with glutathione - agarose beads and washed five times with 0 . 05 % Tween 20 in PBS , and then eluted by 50 mM glutathione in PBS . Glutathione in the samples was removed by dialysis before use . cDNA Cloning of WISH The mouse skeletal muscle C2 myoblast cDNA expression library con - structed in l ZAPII was screened with GST - Ash / Grb2 . Positive plaques were detected using anti - GST antibody ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Positive phage clone - inserted DNA fragments were excised into pBlue - script II KS ( 2 ) ( Stratagene ) and sequenced . The clone encoding WISH ( 2 , 848 bases ) included a single open reading frame of 711 amino acids as shown in Fig . 1 A . Figure 1 .

WISH Activates N - WASP Independent of Cdc42 473 Northern Hybridization of WISH mRNA The WISH cDNA was labeled with [ a - 32 P ] dCTP ( Amersham ) and used as a probe for Northern blot analysis . Total RNA was purified from various tissues of rat . A sample ( 10 m g ) was used for electrophoresis and then transferred to a nylon membrane . The membrane was hybridized with the probe overnight . Then , autoradiography was performed overnight on x - ray film ( Eastman Kodak Co . ) with an intensifying screen . Antibodies Polyclonal antibody against WISH was produced as follows : partial cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1 – 132 ( SH3 ) and 132 - 268 ( Pro ) were li - gated into the BamHI - SacI site and BamHI - KpnI site of pQE32 His - tag expression vector ( QIAGEN ) , respectively . The His - tagged proteins ( His – WISH - SH3 , His - Pro ) were expressed in E . coli and purified with [ Ni 2 1 ] nitrilotriacetic acid - agarose as described by the manufacturer . The purified proteins were injected as an antigen into rabbits to raise poly - clonal antiserum . The resulting antibody was collected by ammonium sul - fate precipitation and affinity purified with the antigen proteins immobi - lized on CNBr - activated Sepharose ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Antibodies against synaptojanin , N - WASP , WAVE , and Arp3 were pro - duced as described previously ( Miura et al . , 1996 ; Fukuoka et al . , 1997 ; Miki et al . , 1998b ; Kato et al . , 1999 , respectively ) . Anti - Ash / Grb2 , anti - Sos , anti – c - Cbl , and anti - Myc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . The His - tag antibody was purchased from QIAGEN . Ectopic Expression in Cos7 The full - length cDNA of mouse WISH expression plasmids was con - structed in the pCMV ( myc - tagged ) or the pcDL - SR a plasmid vector . Wild - type and mutant N - WASP ( H208D ) were constructed in the pcDL - SR a plasmid vector ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . To obtain cell lysates , 20 m g of re - combinant plasmid of full - length WISH was mixed with 10 7 cells , and the mixtures were subjected to electroporation with a Gene Pulser ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . The cells were cultured in DME supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . After 48 h , the cells were harvested with lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM sodium chloride , 5 mM EDTA , 2 mM EGTA , 50 mM sodium fluoride , 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mM so - dium vanadate , 1 mM PMSF , 10 m g / ml aprotinin , 10 m g / ml leupeptin , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . For immunofluorescence microscopy , 5 3 10 4 cells were plated on 35 - mm dishes with coverslips . After 16 h , 4 m g of plasmid DNA was introduced by Ca 2 1 - phosphate precipitation . The cells were serum - starved for 16 h , and then stimulated with or without 0 . 1 m g / ml EGF for 5 min and fixed . In Vitro Binding Assays with GST Fusion Proteins Several GST fusion proteins expressed in E . coli were immobilized on glu - tathine - agarose beads and mixed with histidine - tagged proteins . After be - ing washed with the buffer ( 0 . 05 % Tween 20 in PBS ) , the beads were sus - pended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS - PAGE and Western blot analysis . Figure 2 .

( C ) In vitro association of WISH with Ash / Grb2 . Binding of the His - tagged WISH proline - rich sequence ( His - Pro ) was investigated . GST fu - sion proteins of full - length Ash / Grb2 ( GST - Ash ) , the NH 2 - terminal SH3 domain of Ash / Grb2 ( GST - AshN ) , and the COOH - terminal SH3 of Ash / Grb2 ( GST - AshC ) were immobilized on glutathione - agarose beads and incubated with ( right ) or without ( left ) His - Pro . Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti – His - tag antibody ( a - His ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 152 , 2001 474 Metabolic Labeling of N1E - 115 Cells For the preparation of [ 35 S ] methionine - labeled N1E - 115 cell lysates , semi - confluent cells were placed in methionine - free medium and incubated with 100 m Ci / dish ( 150 mm diameter ) of [ 35 S ] methionine for 3 h . After treatment , the cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated with preim - mune serum or anti - WISH antibody . The precipitates were subjected to SDS - PAGE , and then autoradiography for 3 d with x - ray films ( Eastman Kodak Co . ) . Immunoprecipitation Cos7 cell lysates or N1E - 115 cell lysates were mixed with 10 m g of anti - Myc antibody , anti - WISH antibody , or preimmune rabbit serum ( negative control ) for 1 h . Then , protein A – and G – agarose beads were added , and the mixtures were incubated for another 1 h . The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer , and then analyzed by Western blotting . Cell lysate ( 1 m g ) was also added as a positive control . Purification of Actin , Arp2 / 3 Complex , and N - WASP Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and monomeric actin was isolated by gel filtration on Superdex 200 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) in G buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from bovine brain extracts by a previously described protocol ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . N - WASP was prepared with a baculovirus system as described previously ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) . Actin Polymerization Assay Actin polymerization was measured by monitoring the change in fluores - cence intensity of pyrene - labeled actin as described previously ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . To follow actin polymerization using purified components , pyrene - labeled G - actin or unlabeled G - actin was isolated by incubating freshly thawed proteins in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) for 12 h at 4 8 C and then removing re - sidual F - actin by centrifugation at 40 , 000 g for 1 h . The GST - Cdc42 fusion proteins were mixed with 10 times the amount of GTP g S and incubated for 10 min at 30 8 C . Then the reaction was stopped by adding 10 mM MgCl 2 . Polymerization reaction mixtures contained 2 m M unlabeled actin , 0 . 2 m M pyrene - labeled actin , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and various proteins in 80 m l of X buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 6 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT ) and were preincubated for 5 min . The reaction was started by adding a mixture of actin and pyrene - labeled actin to the preincubated protein mixtures , and fluorescence change was measured at 407 nm with excitation at 365 nm in a fluorescence spectrometer ( Jasco ) . All kinetic analyses were performed using the software provided by the manufacturer . For the actin polymerization assays using bovine brain lysates , bovine brain extracts were prepared according to the method described previously ( Yarar et al . , 1999 ) . The reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 10 m l of bovine brain extract , 10 m l of the ATP - regenerating mix , 80 m l of X buffer , 100 m M GTP g S , and final 0 . 4 m M pyrene - labeled actin . The reaction mix - ture was preincubated for 10 min . Then , GST - Cdc42 ( GTP g S - loaded ) , WISH , Ash , or Fyn SH3 was added before fluorescence was monitored . Immunofluorescence Microscopic Analysis Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed and stored in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS . For immunofluorescence staining , cells were first permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min and then incubated with primary anti - bodies such as anti - Myc , anti – N - WASP , and anti - WISH antibodies for 60 min . After washing , they were incubated with secondary antibodies linked to fluorescein or Cy5 ( Cy5 - conjugated antibody was used only in triple staining experiments ) . To visualize actin filaments , rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) was also added during the incubation with the secondary antibodies . After a 30 - min incubation , coverslips were washed and mounted on slide glasses . Cells were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( model MRC 1024 ; Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Real - time Observation of Microspike Formation Cos7 cells were starved for 24 h with serum - free DME , and microinjection was performed with an Eppendorf microinjector . After injection , cells were observed with a phase – contrast microscope . Proteins ( WISH and / or N - WASP ) which were purified as described above were injected at a final concentration of 4 m M .

WISH Activates N - WASP Independent of Cdc42 475 Results Identification of an Ash / Grb2 - binding Protein , WISH To clarify the downstream signaling of Ash / Grb2 , we searched for binding proteins by screening a l ZAPII cDNA expression library of mouse skeletal muscle C2 myoblasts with GST - Ash / Grb2 fusion proteins expressed in E . coli . We isolated clones that encoded Ash / Grb2 binding pro - teins including c - Cbl , dynamin , and Ack , as well as several novel proteins . Among the novel clones , there was a 2 , 848 - bp cDNA ( sequence data available from GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ under accession no . AF130313 ) containing an open reading frame that encodes a 711 – amino acid protein ( Fig . 1 A ) . We named this protein WASP interacting SH3 protein ( WISH ) because it was found to be an N - WASP activating protein . The predicted amino acid sequence had an SH3 do - main at the NH 2 terminus and three class II – type SH3 bind - ing motifs ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . A leucine zipper - like motif and a serine - rich sequence with overlapping proline - rich se - quences were also found ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . Three clusters of three to five leucine residues were located in the latter half of the protein ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . To confirm that the cDNA encoded full - length WISH protein , we checked the size of the protein expressed in Cos7 cells by Western blot analysis . As shown in Fig . 1 C , WISH - specific antibody reacted with a protein expressed in Cos7 cells . The molecular mass of this protein was the same as that of the endogenous protein ( 90 kD ) from rat brain ( Fig . 1 C ) , indicating that the cDNA clone encodes the full - length WISH protein . Tissue Distribution of WISH To examine the tissue distribution of WISH , we per - formed Northern hybridization analysis with total RNA from various rat tissues .

WISH Activates N - WASP Independent of Cdc42 477 nal was detected in other tissues ( Fig . 2 B ) , which was con - sistent with the Northern hybridization data . To determine the distribution of WISH in brain , its expression in each region of rat brain including cerebrum , cerebellum , dien - cephalon , and medulla oblongata was analyzed by West - ern blotting with anti - WISH antibody . A 90 - kD positive signal was detected in all regions examined ( data not shown ) . We then examined expression of WISH in a vari - ety of cell lines by Western blotting and found that neu - ronal cell lines N1E - 115 and PC12 contained larger amounts of WISH than Cos7 cells , Balb 3T3 cells , and C3H10T1 / 2 cells ( data not shown ) . WISH Associates with Ash / Grb2 SH3 Domains via Proline - rich Sequences To confirm the association between WISH and Ash / Grb2 , we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments . Myc - tagged full - length WISH expression plasmids ( Myc - WISH ) and empty vectors ( Myc - vec ) were transfected transiently into Cos7 cells , and interactions were detected by Western blot analysis after precipitation with anti - Myc antibody ( Fig . 3 A ) . Only immunoprecipitates from Myc - tagged WISH - transfected cell lysates contained Ash / Grb2 ( Fig . 3 A , lane 2 ) . The positive signal was specific , as anti - Myc immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with empty vector did not give positive signal ( Fig . 3 A , lane 1 ) . The two bands above the Ash / Grb2 band in Fig . 3 A are the light chains of the anti - Myc antibody . We then exam - ined whether endogenous WISH associates with Ash / Grb2 by immunoprecipitation with anti - WISH antibody using N1E - 115 cell lysates . Fig . 3 B shows that endogenous WISH associated with Ash / Grb2 in N1E - 115 cells as well . WISH has putative SH3 binding motifs ( proline - rich se - quences ) as described above . To clarify whether these pro - line - rich sequences in WISH can associate with the SH3 domain of Ash / Grb2 , we used a variety of GST fusion pro - teins of Ash / Grb2 such as full - length Ash / Grb2 ( GST - Ash ) , the NH 2 - terminal SH3 domain ( GST - AshN ) , and the COOH - terminal SH3 domain ( GST - AshC ) , and the histidine - tagged proline - rich sequence of WISH ( His - Pro , amino acids 132 – 268 ) , and carried out in vitro binding as - says . As shown in Fig . 3 C , both SH3 domains of Ash / Grb2 bound strongly to the proline - rich sequences in WISH . SH3 domains of the 85 - kD subunit of PI 3 - kinase and PLC g 1 also bound to the proline - rich sequences in WISH in vitro ( data not shown ) . WISH Binds to N - WASP via Its SH3 Domain To investigate WISH signaling , we searched for WISH binding proteins in N1E - 115 cell lysates prelabeled with [ 35 S ] methionine by immunoprecipitation with anti - WISH antibody . As shown in Fig . 4 A , several proteins were found to coprecipitate specifically with WISH . Among them , the band at 65 kD was particularly strong . We postulated that this protein was N - WASP , because N - WASP is a 65 - kD protein and possesses a proline - rich region that may serve as a target for the WISH SH3 domain . To confirm this possibility , we examined anti - WISH immunoprecipitates with various antibodies against proteins such as Sos , c - Cbl , synaptojanin , and Figure 6 continued The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 152 , 2001 478 Fukuoka et al . WISH Activates N - WASP Independent of Cdc42 479 WAVE that contain proline - rich regions . As shown in Fig . 4 B , only N - WASP was coimmunoprecipitated . Sos , c - Cbl , and synaptojanin were not associated with WISH . Another WASP family protein , WAVE , which also has a proline - rich sequence ( Miki et al . , 1998b ) , was not coimmunoprecipitated with WISH , suggesting that WISH - SH3 bound specifically to N - WASP . To con - firm that the SH3 domain of WISH is required for asso - ciation with N - WASP , we made various deletion con - structs of WISH as GST fusion proteins ( Fig . 4 C ) and studied the abilities of these fusion proteins to bind N - WASP ( Fig . 4 D ) . As expected , the full - length and SH3 domain of WISH bound N - WASP . Furthermore , it was found that the SH3 domain of WISH ( His – WISH - SH3 , 1 – 132 amino acids ) bound the proline - rich region of N - WASP ( GST – NW - Pro , 265 – 391 amino acids ) ( Fig . 4 E ) . WISH Further Stimulates N - WASP – induced Arp2 / 3 Complex Activation Because WISH bound specifically to N - WASP , we exam - ined whether WISH could further stimulate N - WASP – induced Arp2 / 3 complex activation in vitro . Actin polymer - ization can be monitored with pyrene - labeled actin , a fluorescent derivative of actin that exhibits higher fluores - cence intensity when actin is assembled into filaments . Us - ing a cell - free system , we measured the effect of N - WASP and WISH on Arp2 / 3 complex – induced actin polymeriza - tion . All proteins used in this experiment are shown in Fig . 5 A . The GST - VCA fusion protein of N - WASP ( VCA ) markedly activated Arp2 / 3 complex – induced actin poly - merization ( Fig . 5 B ) as described previously ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast , full - length N - WASP was not as potent as VCA . Addition of GST - Cdc42 fusion protein ( Cdc42 ) to Figure 7 . WISH enhances N - WASP – induced microspike formation in vivo . ( A ) Microspike formation in Cos7 cells express - ing N - WASP or Myc - WISH . Transfected cells were treated with or without EGF for 5 min , and then fixed , immunostained with anti – N - WASP ( N - WASP ) or anti - Myc ( WISH ) antibodies , and stained with rhodamine - phal - loidin ( actin filaments ) .

( C ) Activation of N - WASP by WISH is independent of Cdc42 . Cos7 cells ex - pressing the N - WASP mutant H208D only or together with Myc - WISH were observed for microspike formation . Cells were incubated with or without EGF for 5 min , and then fixed , immunostained with anti – N - WASP ( H208D ) and anti - Myc ( WISH ) antibodies , and stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( actin filaments ) . ( D ) Real - time observation of mi - crospike formation . Cos7 cells were microin - jected with purified N - WASP and / or GST - WISH proteins . After microinjection , cells were observed with a phase – contrast micro - scope . Membrane protrusions ( filopodia ) are indicated with arrows . ( E ) Quantification of microspike formation . Transfected cells were serum - starved and then stimulated with or without EGF for 5 min . The percentage of cells forming microspikes among transfected cells was calculated . Error bars represent the SD of three different measurements . At least 50 cells were counted in each determination . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 152 , 2001 480 N - WASP in this system increased Arp2 / 3 complex – induced actin polymerization to the level evoked by VCA in the presence of PIP 2 ( data not shown ) , but addition of Cdc42 without PIP 2 did not increase activity to that of VCA ( Fig . 5 B ) . Surprisingly , addition of GST - WISH fusion protein ( WISH ) to N - WASP increased the Arp2 / 3 complex – induced actin polymerization to the level induced by VCA even in the absence of Cdc42 . Addition of Cdc42 did not increase activity any further ( Fig . 5 B ) . WISH did not activate Arp2 / 3 complex directly without N - WASP ( Fig . 5 B ) . We then checked whether GST fusion proteins of other SH3 proteins such as Ash / Grb2 ( Ash ) , Fyn , Nck , Ash / Grb2 NH 2 - terminal SH3 domain ( AshN ) , p85 , and PLC g 1 ( PLC g ) also activate Arp2 / 3 complex as well . Ash and AshN stimulated N - WASP – induced Arp2 / 3 complex acti - vation ( Fig . 5 C ) as described previously ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ) , but they were less effective than WISH . The SH3 domains from Fyn , PLC g , Nck , and p85 also activated N - WASP . However , these SH3 proteins were not as potent as Ash ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . In contrast , WISH - SH3 ( SH3 ) caused significant and tremendous activation of N - WASP . Thus , WISH was found to be the strongest activator of N - WASP among the SH3 proteins examined . Interestingly , Cdc42 was not necessary for the activation to the level in - duced by VCA . This activation was detected only with the SH3 domain of WISH ( Fig . 5 C ) . Basic proteins that do not contain SH3 domains , such as myelin basic protein ( MBP ; Upstate Biotechnology ) , did not activate N - WASP at all , suggesting that activation was not merely due to ionic inter - action ( Fig . 5 C ) . We further examined the concentration - dependent effect on actin polymerization ( Fig . 5 D ) . Both SH3 domains of WISH and full - length WISH increased the initial actin polymerization rate in a concentration - depen - dent manner , and their activation potencies were higher than those of other SH3 domains , such as AshN and Fyn . Thus far , it has been thought that the N - WASP VCA re - gion , which is masked under resting conditions , is exposed by binding of Cdc42 to the GBD / CRIB motif of N - WASP . Taken together , these results present the idea that WISH alone can expose the VCA region of N - WASP by binding to the proline - rich region of N - WASP independent of Cdc42 . Depletion of WISH from Bovine Brain Extracts Decreases Actin Polymerization Activity of Bovine Brain Extracts Addition of Cdc42 to extracts of neutrophils ( Zigmond et al . , 1998 ) or Xenopus oocytes ( Ma et al . , 1998 ) induces an increase in actin polymerization . In addition , WASP - depen - dent actin comets have also been shown to be formed in bovine brain extracts ( Yarar et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , we further applied bovine brain extracts instead of purified proteins to examine the involvement of WISH in actin polymeriza - tion under a condition that more closely reflects the in vivo situation . Addition of bovine brain extracts induced actin polymerization in the presence of Cdc42 . To address whether WISH , N - WASP , or Arp2 / 3 complex contributes to actin polymerization activity in brain extracts , WISH , N - WASP , and Arp2 / 3 complex were depleted with anti - WISH antibody , anti – N - WASP antibody , and GST - CA protein treatment , respectively ( Fig . 6 A ) . In WISH - depleted extracts , 90 % of WISH was removed , whereas N - WASP levels remained constant ( Fig . 6 A ) . Approxi - mately 98 % of N - WASP or 95 % of Arp2 / 3 complex was removed in the respective depleted extract . These depleted extracts were used to examine the roles of Arp2 / 3 complex , N - WASP , and WISH in brain extract – induced actin poly - merization . Addition of Cdc42 or WISH to mock - treated extracts increased initial actin polymerization markedly , but Fyn SH3 did not ( Fig . 6 B , a ) . On the other hand , the maximal actin polymerization levels that were attained up to 100 min were similar for Mock , Mock 1 Cdc42 , and Mock 1 WISH ( data not shown ) , suggesting that WISH activates the initial rate of actin polymerization . As ex - pected , Cdc42 , WISH , and WISH - SH3 activated the initial actin polymerization rate ( Fig . 6 B , b ) . Arp2 / 3 complex was essential for brain extract – induced actin polymerization , because addition of Cdc42 or WISH to Arp2 / 3 complex – depleted extracts did not restore activity ( Fig . 6 C , a and b ) . Adding back of Arp2 / 3 complex did restore polymer - ization activity ( data not shown ) . WISH depletion did not affect basal activity without Cdc42 ( Fig . 6 D , a and b ) , but addition of excess WISH to WISH - depleted extracts in - creased actin polymerization activity ( Fig . 6 , Da and Db ) . N - WASP depletion also did not affect basal actin polymer - ization activity , but addition of WISH to N - WASP – depleted extracts increased the activity significantly ( Fig . 6 E , a and b ) , although addition of Cdc42 increased the ac - tivity only slightly . These findings suggest that WISH acti - vates Arp2 / 3 complex not only in an N - WASP – dependent manner but also in an N - WASP – independent manner . WISH and N - WASP Induce Microspike Formation Cooperatively In Vivo To examine whether WISH stimulates N - WASP – induced microspike formation , WISH and N - WASP were coex - pressed in Cos7 cells . Expression of WISH or N - WASP alone did not cause any morphological changes in Cos7 cells ( Fig . 7 A ) . In response to EGF stimulation , however , N - WASP – expressing cells formed microspikes , whereas WISH - expressing cells did not . When WISH and N - WASP were coexpressed , microspike formation was induced even in the absence of EGF ( Fig . 7 B ) , though the structure of actin filaments was also altered . To clarify whether Cdc42 is necessary for N - WASP – induced microspike formation when WISH is present , we used an N - WASP mutant ( H208D ) that cannot bind Cdc42 ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) . H208D alone was not able to induce microspike formation even in the presence of EGF ( Fig . 7 C , top panels ) . How - ever , coexpression of H208D and WISH did induce mi - crospike formation ( Fig . 7 C , bottom panels ) . Real - time observation by phase – contrast microscopy revealed that these microspikes were filopodia but not retraction fibers ( Fig . 7 D ) . The numbers of cells that formed microspikes were also increased by coexpression of WISH and N - WASP or WISH and H208D ( Fig . 7 E ) . All these results indicate that WISH alone has an ability to activate N - WASP to in - duce microspike formation without the aid of Cdc42 . Discussion WISH Is a Novel Adaptor Protein That Activates N - WASP WISH is a 90 - kD protein that contains one SH3 domain at the NH 2 terminus and three SH3 binding sites , which are proline - rich sequences ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . WISH associates Fukuoka et al . WISH Activates N - WASP Independent of Cdc42 481 with SH3 domains in Ash / Grb2 through these proline - rich sequences ( Fig . 3 C ) , but it also associates with the SH3 domains of PLC g 1 , Fyn , Nck , and PI 3 - kinase 85 - kD sub - unit in vitro . WISH is probably recruited to the activated receptors for these proteins in response to extracellular stimuli as a downstream molecule in tyrosine kinase sig - naling . Thus , WISH is thought to act as an adaptor protein that binds to SH3 domains of these proteins . The NH 2 terminus of WISH contains an SH3 domain and was shown to form a complex with N - WASP ( Fig . 4 ) . Bind - ing through the WISH - SH3 domain appears to be fairly spe - cific because other proline - rich proteins such as Sos , synapto - janin , c - Cbl , and WAVE , which are all known to bind various SH3 domains , did not bind WISH ( Fig . 4 B ) . N - WASP can activate Arp2 / 3 complex through the VCA region at its COOH terminus , resulting in rapid polymerization of actin ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . The mechanism of N - WASP activation is explained as follows . Under resting conditions , the VCA region essential for Arp2 / 3 complex activation is masked by an intramolecular interaction with the region containing the GBD / CRIB motif ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) . When cells are stimu - lated , activated Cdc42 binds to the GBD / CRIB motif . This leads to the exposure of the VCA region , where G - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex are recruited . Consequently , actin polymer - ization is induced in the cortical area of cells , resulting in filopodium formation . Indeed , GST - VCA protein remark - ably activates Arp2 / 3 complex – induced actin polymerization , indicating that the VCA region is the minimal essential re - gion for Arp2 / 3 complex activation . However , it should be noted that activated Cdc42 can only partially activate N - WASP and requires addition of PIP 2 to reach the activa - tion level induced by GST - VCA protein ( Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) . We show here that an N - WASP binding protein , WISH , can also expose the VCA region of N - WASP and ef - fectively enhance N - WASP – induced Arp2 / 3 complex activa - tion ( Fig . 5 B ) . This activation is mediated by the binding through the SH3 domain of WISH , because the fusion pro - tein containing the SH3 domain also has activating ability ( Fig . 5 C ) . Ash / Grb2 SH3 can also activate N - WASP ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ) but much less potently than WISH - SH3 did ( Fig . 5 C ) . In addition , other SH3 elements such as the SH3 of Fyn , Nck , PLC g 1 , and PI 3 - kinase 85 - kD subunit cause only weak activation of N - WASP ( Fig . 5 C ) . WISH Activates Arp2 / 3 Complex – induced Actin Polymerization Independent of Cdc42 More interestingly , WISH enhances N - WASP – induced Arp2 / 3 complex activation to the level of GST - VCA pro - tein even in the absence of Cdc42 ( Fig . 5 B ) , suggesting that binding of WISH to N - WASP is sufficient for full acti - vation . It is known that brain extracts induce WASP - dependent actin comet formation ( Yarar et al . , 1999 ) . In this case , addition of WISH instead of Cdc42 also activates actin polymerization to the level induced by Cdc42 ( Fig . 6 B ) . When WISH is added to N - WASP – depleted extracts , such activation is still observed . In contrast , addition of Cdc42 to this system does not restore activity ( Fig . 6 E ) . This suggests that WISH activates Arp2 / 3 complex through both N - WASP – dependent and – independent pathways ( Fig . 8 ) and that Cdc42 is not required for either pathway if WISH is present . WASP and N - WASP also bind several proteins such as WIP and proline serine threonine phosphatase interacting protein ( PSTPIP ) ( Ramesh et al . , 1997 ; Wu et al . , 1998 ) . These proteins may have N - WASP – activating activity as well , though their effects on N - WASP – induced activation of Arp2 / 3 complex have not been examined . Possible Roles of WISH in Neuronal Cells Both WISH and N - WASP are expressed predominantly in brain and neuronal cells ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , WISH depletion experiments revealed that WISH is sig - nificantly involved in Arp2 / 3 complex – induced actin poly - merization by brain extracts ( Fig . 6 D ) . The axonal growth cone , which is a highly dynamic structure at the tip of the axon , consists of filopodial and lamellipodial protrusions that respond to both positive and negative external guidance cues . Considering the fact that coexpression of WISH and N - WASP induces filopo - dium formation in Cos7 cells ( Fig . 7 , B and D ) , it may be possible that WISH also acts for forming filopodia in neu - ral cells , in which filopodium formation has been shown to be essential for neurite extension . However , the precise functions of WISH in neural cells remain to be clarified . We thank Dr . Toshihiko Suzuki and Dr .
