Introduction Axonal cytoskeleton in neuron is comprised of microtubules ( MT ) [ 1 ] tau proteins [ 2 , 3 ] , neuroﬁlaments ( NF ) [ 4 ] , and microﬁla - ments ( MF ) [ 5 ] . Most mechanical contribution to the stability of the cytoskeleton comes from MTs , but recent studies emphasize on a combination of contribution of the other major components . The structural contribution of actin to axonal cytoskeleton has been substantiated very recently . Globular G - actins lead to formation of ﬁlamentous F - actins , which eventually form periodic rings along thecircumferenceofaxon [ 6 ] . Theperiodicactinringsareconnected by spectrin tetramers [ 7 ] . Therefore , the actin - spectrin network determines the axonal mechanical behavior . However , the current literature does not consist sufﬁcient number of studies on mechan - ical behavior of actin , spectrin , and actin - spectrin network – espe - cially in high strain and strain rate scenario , although deformation ofaxonalcytoskeletalcomponentsisanimportantconcernindiffer - ent injury scenarios [ 8 – 12 ] . This study attemptsto explore the three aspects mentioned above by performing molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation , as this methodology provides convenience in the speci - ﬁc length scale ( ~ 10 s of nanometers ) of sub - axonal components . 1 . 1 . Actin : Mechanical insights in literature There are several studies focusing on mechanical behavior of actin existent in current literature . The convenience of studying actin comes from its conserved structure . Since 1990 0 s , most mechanical properties of actin have been investigated , such as response to tensile loading and stiffness [ 13 – 19 ] , persistence length [ 20 – 23 ] , torsional aspects [ 20 , 21 , 24 – 28 ] , severing mecha - nism [ 29 ] , viscoelasticity [ 30 , 31 ] , etc . have been determined . Com - putational studies such as molecular dynamics studies have particularly contributed to substantiate mechanical properties of actin [ 14 , 32 ] . Speciﬁcally , recent comprehensive review work has concluded that the Young’s modulus of actin may vary from mega - pascal to gigapascal range [ 10 ] . Furthermore , computational mod - eling of actin has been diverse – from fully atomistic to coarse - grained [ 33 ] . 1 . 2 . Spectrin : Mechanical insights in literature Studies on spectrin has been performed mostly from biological perspective [ 34 ] , and therefore , functionality has been the prime focus of such research . Furthermore , most of the studies have been limited to erythroid spectrins , leading to limited mechanical insight into axonal spectrin [ 35 ] . The limited mechanical insight that can be gathered from the current literature are on shear [ 36 ] https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . csbj . 2021 . 03 . 026 2001 - 0370 / (cid:1) 2021 The Authors .

However , a number of studies focusing on forced unfolding have provided insight regarding multiple intermediate regions in spectrin struc - ture [ 39 – 43 ] , destabilization criteria [ 44 ] and required force to dis - entangle spectrin ﬁlament [ 45 , 46 ] . 1 . 3 . Periodic actin - spectrin skeleton : Role in axon and high strain rate scenario The periodicity of actin - spectrin is not only limited to the main axon , but also found in dendrites and axon initial segment [ 6 , 47 – 53 ] , which is an early age phenomenon for most species [ 54 ] . While the substantiation of the periodic actin - spectrin structure and the contribution to axonal stability are signiﬁcant ﬁndings [ 55 – 58 ] , the mechanical behavior at high strain rate scenario , such as actin - spectrin separation stretch is still absent in the literature . To address such limitations , biochemical and biological approaches will dictate the actin - spectrin network studies over the next few years [ 59 , 60 ] . Nevertheless , the very recent mechanical studies are promising , such as the one performed on chicken dorsal root ganglion [ 61 ] depicting that axonal cytoskeletal components can provide shock - absorbing support to the axon . Such studies are pav - ing the pathway to determine the speciﬁc contribution of actin and spectrin to the stability of the periodic network . From the literature review , it is evident that more mechanical studies are required focusing on spectrin and actin - spectrin net - work , which can be achieved by computational approaches as depicted by molecular level studies on other axonal cytoskeletal components [ 11 , 62 ] . Keeping these aspects in consideration , this study attempts to provide novel insights regarding the speciﬁc mechanical behavior of such cytoskeletal components at extreme strain rate – which will play an instrumental role in developing a bottom - up axon model focusing on high strain rate scenario and contribute to the existent computational axon models . 2 . Method The required PDB ﬁle and FASTA sequence for actin and spectrin structures are obtained from RCSB and Uniprot protein data banks , and then simulation - compliant models are built based on the pre - dicted structures obtained from the i - TASSER predictor software [ 63 ] . The reason of proceeding with i - TASSER predicted structure is its reliability quantiﬁed by CASP and recent successful imple - mentation of predicted structure in MD simulations [ 11 , 64 , 65 ] . The PDB ﬁles are converted into LAMMPS [ 66 ] readable data ﬁles that implements OPLS force ﬁeld [ 67 , 68 ] for simulation . The simulation box is ﬁlled with explicit water molecules , for which MARTINI force ﬁeld [ 69 ] is used for van der Waals interaction parameters . Required Na + and Cl - ions were added to obtain charge neutralization for explicit solvent simulations . The general scheme of the simulation comprises of : a . Minimizing potential energy at 310 K ( the ﬂat potential energy vs time graph ensures well equilibration ) , b . Using inner and outer cutoff of LJ potentials as 10 and 12 , respectively , c . Using solver pppm ( particle – particle particle - mesh ) , which facilitates the computation of long - range coulombic interaction , d . NVT equilibration of the system with 100 fs temperature damping parameter ( ﬁrst 100 ps ) , e . NPT equilibration of the system with target pressure of 1 bar ( for another 100 ps ) , f . Performing tensile tests by pulling the residues along the length axis , towards the opposite direction , at the strain rates of 10 8 s (cid:2) 1 and 10 9 s (cid:2) 1 [ 62 ] . It is assumed that ~ 0 % of strain is sufﬁcient to obtain the stiffness data . Table 1 summarizes the box size of the systems and the speciﬁc tensile test schemes . 2 . 1 . Tensile test on 6 - actin and 12 - actin models To determine mechanical property of actin , 6 - actin and 12 - actin models are utilized . Both models are built from existent literature . The 6 - actin model is obtained from ‘‘actin ﬁlament pointed end” structure found by electron microscopy deposited with PDB ID 2Y83 [ 70 ] , while the 12 - actin model is obtained from the cryo - EM structure of actin deposited with PDB ID 3G37 [ 71 ] . The objective of tensile test is to observe strain rate dependence and difference between the stretching mechanism between short and long F - actin ﬁlaments . 2 . 2 . Tensile test on a - spectrin and b - spectrin For a - spectrin and b - spectrin , the models are built from Uniprot structures – for non - erythrocytic a - spectrin ( gene : SPTAN1 ) [ 72 ] and b - spectrin ( SPTBN2 ) [ 73 ] structures . These sources facilitate speciﬁcation of domains and repeat regions , which is utilized in the modeling and tensile tests . The tensile test scheme is similar to that of actin . The simulation - compliant versions are created by using the last seven ( 7 ) repeats and the EF hand regions for a - spectrin , while the ﬁrst seven ( 7 ) repeats and the actin binding domain are used for b - spectrin . According to the comprehensive Table 1 Simulation setup for tensile tests on actin , spectrin , and actin - spectrin models .

Adnan Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 19 ( 2021 ) 1738 – 1749 1739 review study on spectrin [ 7 ] , 19 – 20 repeats in a - spectrin and 1 – 2 repeats in b - spectrin are sufﬁcient for actin - spectrin modeling , and therefore , it is ensured that these repeats are included in the stan - dalone spectrin models . The speciﬁcation of the residue numbers of both spectrin isoforms are provided in Table 1 . Aside from obtaining the mechanical property , another objective of the tensile test on standalone spectrin is to observe the unfolding mechanism . 2 . 3 . Determination of actin - spectrin interaction For actin - spectrin interaction model , two b - spectrin ﬁlaments ( a smaller version with the actin - binding domain and the ﬁrst two repeats ) [ 7 ] are attached to the 12 - actin surface , and then pulled at the opposite directions . The objective of applying two dif - ferent strain rates is to observe the strain rate dependence and pos - sible separation mechanism . This ensures that possible high strain rate scenarios are covered where either of the axonal cytoskeletal components might be susceptible to stretching . 2 . 4 . Stress - strain calculation and tensile test schemes Calculation of the stress and strain are similar to recently pub - lished MD work on axonal cytoskeletal component of neuron [ 11 ] . In a simple manner , the stress – strain calculation scheme can be pointed out as : a . Obtaining stress values from per - atomic stress tensor in LAMMPS , which is associated with the volume of the respec - tive group of atoms , b . Calculating approximate volume of the group of atoms by implementing Voronoi feature of LAMMPS , which is included in the voro + + package , c . Dividing the ( stress (cid:3) volume ) data by the approximate vol - ume from Voronoi calculation to obtain the stress data , d . Obtaining strain values from displacement data of atoms [ 74 ] , e . Maintaining NVT ensemble throughout the tensile test , with a 100 fs temperature damping parameter . As a relevant note , visualization snapshots are obtained by OVITO [ 75 ] . All the simulations were carried out by the STAM - PEDE2 and Lonestar supercomputers of Texas Advanced Comput - ing Center ( TACC ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Mechanical behavior of actin For 6 - actin and 12 - actin systems , uniaxial tensile tests are per - formed at two strain rates , 10 8 s (cid:2) 1 and 10 9 s (cid:2) 1 . Figs . 1 – 3 show the stress – strain response and tensile test snapshots for the 6 - actin system , while Figs . 4 – 6 show the same for the 12 - actin system . It is observed that both 6 - actin and 12 - actin behave as stiffer mate - rial at higher strain rate . However , the stretching stiffness is in the range found in the literature , even at such high strain rate . 3 . 2 . Mechanical behavior of spectrin For a - spectrin and b - spectrin systems , uniaxial tensile tests are performed at two strain rates , 10 8 s (cid:2) 1 and 10 9 s (cid:2) 1 . Figs . 7 – 9 show the stress – strain response and tensile test snapshots for the a - spectrin system , while Figs . 10 – 12 show the same for the b - actin system . It is observed that spectrin also behaves as stiffer material when susceptible to higher strain rate . However , the extent of dependence on the strain rate is relatively lower , as spectrin goes through unfolding stage of the interrepeat domains unlike actins ( which manifest stretching of the F - actin ﬁlaments even at low strain due to strong bond between G - actins in the ﬁlament ) as depicted by the snapshots . Table 2 summarizes the stiffness result based on the linear ﬁt of 10 % strain vs stress data of actin and spectrin models . 3 . 3 . Actin - spectrin interaction For actin - spectrin systems , tensile tests are performed at two strain rates , 10 8 s (cid:2) 1 and 10 9 s (cid:2) 1 by attaching two b - spectrin to the surface of a 12 - actin system , and then pulled away towards the opposite directions . Figs . 13 and 14 show the tensile test snap - shots for the system for 10 8 s (cid:2) 1 and 10 9 s (cid:2) 1 , respectively . It is depicted that not only the separation differs according to the applied strain rate , but also the failure mechanism . At lower strain rate , the prone - to - failure region is the actin - spectrin interface , while at higher strain rate , it is the inter - repeat regions of spectrin . 4 . Discussion The tensile tests performed in this study provides novel insights into mechanical behavior of actin , spectrin , and actin - spectrin cytoskeleton in axon . However , as a computational study , some common issues must be addressed – such as selection of force ﬁeld , application of strain rate , and using predicted structure for protein . Fig . 1 . Stress – strain response of 6 actin system for two strain rates . Md Ishak Khan , Sheikh Fahad Ferdous and A . Adnan Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 19 ( 2021 ) 1738 – 1749 1740 First , selection of appropriate force ﬁeld is vital for realistic rep - resentation of a biophysical scenario . In this study , OPLS force ﬁeld is used for simulations , as it is speciﬁcally ﬁne - tuned for protein simulation [ 76 , 77 ] . Recently it is found that non - reactive force ﬁeld such as CHARMM can successfully capture high deformation phe - nomena for cytoskeletal components of neuron [ 11 , 62 ] . As a benchmark test , the tensile test on a - spectrin is performed for both CHARMM and OPLS force ﬁelds , which shows comparable results as depicted in the Appendix 1 . Second , the strain rates used in this study for the tensile tests fall into ‘‘extreme” range for axonal cytoskeletal components . However , recent computational study on such components has found such range of strain rates as relevant to cavitation bubble implosion ( blast - induced traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) scenario ) [ 62 ] . And third , proceeding with predicted structure obtained from the FASTA sequence available in the protein data bank ( PDB ) is jus - tiﬁed due to increased application and successful implementation in the recent years [ 11 , 64 , 65 , 78 ] . In the following sub - sections , the speciﬁc aspects of the obtained results , their impact , and future directions are discussed . 4 . 1 . Mechanical behavior of actin in high strain rate scenario Studies that explored the failure mechanism of actin have emphasized the effect of actin - severing proteins , such as coﬁlin [ 27 , 79 ] . While it is admitted that both biochemical and mechanical aspects should be considered for determining mechanical behavior of actin at high strain rate , it can be argued that effect of mechan - ical loading ( applied tension on the protein in this study ) will be most signiﬁcant at extreme strain rate scenario , which is shown in recent studies on other axonal cytoskeletal components of neu - ron [ 11 , 62 ] . Furthermore , from the results of both 6 - actin and 12 - actin systems it is substantiated that actin behaves as a stiffer material at higher strain rate . Increase of extensional and torsional stiffness is established in the literature [ 14 ] , which is in harmony with the ﬁnding of the current study . Therefore , from the perspec - tive of extensional stiffness , it can be asserted that mechanical behavior of actin is maintained throughout a large range of tensile loading . The only difference between the 6 - actin and 12 - actin sys - tem is the failure mechanism . For 6 - actin or shorter system , actin tends to fail along the junction of G - actin to G - actin . Similar type of failure is also observed for MTs at extreme strain rate , which fails along the line of the tubulin junction when susceptible to ten - sile loading [ 62 ] . As there is mainly electrostatic and van der Waals bond i . e . non - bonded interactions between G - actins , it is expected that these bonds will be broken before the covalent bonds within the G - actin atoms . However , for longer system ( 12 - actin ) , the pulled region is substantially smaller than the overall ﬁlament length , and therefore , the tensile load can be carried along the length of the whole ﬁlament – leading to high stretchability . The range of stiffness is , however , coherent with recent review work [ 10 ] , which suggests that at high strain rate , actin stiffness will be at the high end of the range proposed ( 400 MPa - 2 . 5GPa ) [ 14 – 19 , 32 ] .

Adnan Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 19 ( 2021 ) 1738 – 1749 1741 4 . 2 . Mechanical behavior of spectrin in high strain rate scenario Similar to that of actin , the mechanical behavior of spectrin can also be explained from the biochemical perspective [ 34 ] . Earlier atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) studies on spectrin tandem repeats and single spectrin have established that susceptibility to tensile loading leads to unfolding and stretching , which is impressively close to the observation in the current study [ 39 , 40 , 42 ] . Further - more , the high stretchability can be attributed to the initial ‘‘folded” state of the repeat regions and the inter - repeat regions , which get unfolded due to applied high strain rate . Although the force required to unfold spectrin has been found to be small [ 45 ] , it can be asserted that due to having multiple un - foldable regions throughout the structure , axonal spectrin can have high stretcha - bility . However , the multiple fold is attributed to the mechanical strength of the spectrin ﬁlament , and unfolding leads to vulnerabil - ity to failure . It is discussed in recent studies that axonal cytoskele - tal components provide mechanical stretchability due to their Fig . 4 . Stress – strain response of 12 actin system for two strain rates .

Adnan Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 19 ( 2021 ) 1738 – 1749 1742 inherent capacity to stretch even more than 100 % of their initial length [ 61 ] , and therefore , it can be assumed that this capacity is originated from the ability of membrane - associated proteins in axon which contain folded regions i . e . spectrins . Therefore , the results on spectrin not only substantiates the structural and mechanical insights present in the current literature , but also pro - vides indirect causation of the ability of axon to stretch signiﬁcantly . 4 . 3 . Actin - Spectrin interaction in high strain rate scenario There is little insight present in the current literature regarding actin - spectrin network [ 61 ] . From the actin - spectrin models in the current study it is substantiated that even at high strain rate , actin - spectrin lattice can provide substantial mechanical support . Also , two different manners of failure can be observed according to the applied strain rates . At lower strain rate , there is signiﬁcant stretch in spectrin , but the primary failure - prone region is the actin - spectrin interface . However , the scenario is different at higher strain rate , as the tensile loading gets less amount of time to be propagated through the spectrin ﬁlament and manifested at the interface region . Therefore , it is observed that the more damage - prone area is the inter - repeat regions of spectrin – same observation obtained in standalone spectrin tensile tests per - formed in this study . In other words , at a high strain rate scenario , there could be occurrence of different failure along the periodic actin - spectrin lattice : such as separation of spectrin from actin sur - face , substantial spectrin unfolding , or both . In any case , the result is disorientation of the axonal cytoskeleton of neuron , regarding Fig . 7 . Stress – strain response of a - spectrin system for two strain rates . Fig . 8 .

However , for more comprehensive insight , length - dependent tests could also be performed as the F - actin models in this study . For this purpose , different number of repeats might be implemented in the actin - spectrin models . Opti - mistically , the future works will be considering coarse - grained models to accommodate longer ﬁlament lengths and multiscale approach to obtain lattice - level mechanical response . 5 .

Fig . A1 shows the stress – strain response for both force ﬁelds , which depicts that both force ﬁelds similar results . Further - more , Fig . A2 shows that both CHARMM and OPLS shows similar manner of unfolding in a - spectrin . Considering these ﬁndings , it can be concluded that both force ﬁelds are equally eligible candi - dates for such simulations . Fig . A1 .
