Walter Englander , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , and approved November 28 , 2006 ( received for review June 30 , 2006 ) Actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex nucleates new branches in actin ﬁlaments playing a key role in controlling eukaryotic cell motility . This process is tightly regulated by activating factors : ATP and WASp - family proteins . However , the mechanism of activation remains largely hypothetical . We used radiolytic protein footprint - ing with mass spectrometry in solution to probe the effects of nucleotide - and WASp - binding on Arp2 / 3 . These results represent two signiﬁcant advances in such footprinting approaches . First , Arp2 / 3 is the most complex macromolecular assembly yet exam - ined ; second , only a few picomoles of Arp2 / 3 was required for individual experiments . In terms of structural biology of Arp 2 / 3 , we ﬁnd that ATP binding induces conformational changes within Arp2 / 3 complex in Arp3 ( localized in peptide segments 5 – 18 , 212 – 225 , and 318 – 327 ) and Arp2 ( within peptide segment 300 – 316 ) . These data are consistent with nucleotide docking within the nucleotide clefts of the actin - related proteins promoting closure of the cleft of the Arp3 subunit . However , ATP binding does not induce conformational changes in the other Arp subunits . Arp2 / 3 complex binds to WASp within the C subdomain at residue Met 474 andwithintheAsubdomaintoTrp500 . Ourdatasuggestabivalent attachment of WASp to Arp3 ( within peptides 162 – 191 and 318 – 329 ) and Arp2 ( within peptides 66 – 80 and 87 – 97 ) . WASp - depen - dent protections from oxidation within peptides 54 – 65 and 80 – 91 of Arp3 and in peptides 300 – 316 of Arp2 suggest domain rear - rangements of Arp2 and Arp3 resulting in a closed conformational state consistent with an ‘‘actin - dimer’’ model for the active state . actin (cid:1) dynamics (cid:1) footprinting A rp2 / 3 complex is an ensemble of seven conserved protein subunits , including two actin - related proteins Arp2 , and Arp3 , and five subunits named ARPC1 p40 , ARPC2 p34 , ARPC3 p21 , ARPC4 p20 , and ARPC5 p16 ( 1 – 5 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex is thought to initiate actin polymerization as a branch on the side of an existing actin filament by forming a dimer of Arp2 and Arp3 arranged like subunits in an actin filament at the slow - growing pointed end of the new actin filament ( 1 , 6 , 7 ) . The apo - complex is inactive ( 7 ) and requires ATP as well as nucle - ation - promoting cofactors such as SCAR / WASp family proteins and preexisting actin filaments to initiate growth of new fila - ments ( 8 – 10 ) . This tight regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex activity is crucial to the temporal and spatial regulation of filament as - sembly at the leading edge of motile cells . The molecular mechanism leading to activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex lacks comprehensive experimental support . The high - resolution crystal structure of the apo - form of the complex shows a large separation between the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits , so forma - tion of a dimer of Arps similar to two consecutive subunits in an actin filament requires substantial conformational rearrangements ( 7 ) . It has been postulated that nucleation - promoting factors may induce major conformational rearrangements in the Arp2 / 3 com - plex to bring the two Arps closer together ( 7 ) . However , the current model of Arp2 / 3 activation remains primary hypothetical due to the lack of a high - resolution structure of an activated conformation as well as the lack of high - resolution , solution based structural ap - proaches to address these questions . ATP binding to both Arp2 and Arp3 is thought to drive at least part of this conformational change ( 7 , 11 ) . A crystal structure of the apo - form of the Arp2 / 3 complex showed the nucleotide pockets of Arp subunits 2 and 3 to be empty and open ( 7 ) . In crystals of Arp2 / 3 complex soaked in ATP or ADP , nucleotides bound the clefts of both Arps ( 12 ) . Nucleotide binding was accompanied by local rearrangements around the nucleotide clefts , but lattice contacts may have limited more extensive rearrangements of the molecule ( 11 , 12 ) . The WASp family of proteins , which interact with preexisting filaments to stimulate full nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , contain a conserved C - terminal segment ( 70 aa ) known as WASp VCA ( 13 ) . It consists of three distinct functional regions : an actin - binding verprolin - homology domain ( V ) , a central region ( C ) that interacts with both the Arp2 / 3 complex and monomeric actin , and the acidic segment ( A ) that is thought to interact directly with the complex . It has been proposed that binding of the CA segment of WASp proteins to the complex may favor or stabilize a conforma - tion where Arp subunits are in contact with each other and with an actin monomer associated with the V region ( 7 ) . This actin mono - mer becomes the first subunit in the new actin filament branch ( 7 ) . EM and single - particle averaging of yeast and bovine Arp2 / 3 complex using negative stain ( (cid:1) 25 - Å image resolution ) showed WASp - mediated closure of the gap between Arp2 and Arp3 apparently priming the complex for actin nucleation ( 14 ) . We used oxidative protein footprinting and mass spectrometry to probe the effect of ATP and WASp on the conformation of the Arp2 / 3 complex in solution with resolution at the level of single side chains ( 15 – 17 ) . In protein complexes , the reactive residues buried between interfaces are protected from oxidation , making it possible to detect changes in surface accessibility . However , allosteric changes in protein conformation induced by ligand binding can also give rise to either protections or enhancements of oxidation . Thus , confirmation of the proposed interface should include additional biochemical or structural data . This approach has been successfully applied to large proteins and complexes such as gelsolin ( 85 kDa ) ( 18 ) , the transferrin – transferrin receptor complex ( a complex with total molecular mass of 330 kDa ) ( 19 ) , and F - actin ( a megadalton Authorcontributions : J .

Arp2 / 3 has the greatest complexity of any sample examined to date using this method ( 220 kDa of unique sequence ) and typical experiments were carried out with a few picomoles of material , this was necessitated in part by the need fully occupy the WASp binding sites on Arp2 / 3 by using a 1 (cid:1) M concentration of Arp2 / 3 . We analyzed the conformation of the apo - form of the Arp2 / 3 complex and the conformational changes upon binding to ATP in the presence and absence of WASp . Data support the idea that WASp binding crosslinks Arp3 ( within peptide segments 162 – 191 and 318 – 329 ) and Arp2 ( within peptide segments 66 – 80 and 87 – 97 ) . We also identified the sites within WASp that bind Arp2 / 3 complex . Overall , these data provide firm experimental support to previously hypothetical mechanisms of Arp2 / 3 activation and illus - trate the emerging power of structural mass spectrometry ap - proaches to provide solution based structural information on large complexes . Results and Discussion Consistency of Footprinting and Crystallographic Data for the Arp2 / 3 Complex . Arp2 / 3 complex at a concentration of 1 (cid:1) M prepared in either the absence or presence of 1 mM ATP was exposed to the X - 28C x - ray white beam for intervals from 0 to 80 ms ; on these time scales , oxidative modifications dominate the chemistry compared with cross - linking events and cleavage ( 21 ) . Moreover , because the solvent - accessible surfaces of the most reactive side chains are primarily involved in the oxidation , the effects on the global protein structure are minimal ( 22 ) . After digestion of the protein complex with trypsin , (cid:2) 200 peptides , covering (cid:1) 80 % of the sequence in Arp2 / 3 , were analyzed quantitatively by mass spectrometry coupled to high performance liquid chromatography . The identities of these peptides were verified by MS / MS analysis . Many short tryptic peptides ( covering (cid:1) 20 % of the Arp2 / 3 sequence ) were not de - tected due to their poor retention on the C18 reverse phase column used . More than 160 peptides were clearly identified , but their oxidation was not detected , and they are considered to be not modified in these experiments . The extent of the side chain modification for the 30 peptides that were found to be reproducibly oxidized for both the nucleotide - free and nucleotide - bound Arp2 / 3 complex was derived from total ion currents for each modified peptide at each exposure time . Table 1 lists the first - order rate constants derived from the plots ( dose – response curves ) . The measured fractions of unmodified peptide varied (cid:3) 5 % in their absolute values in triplicate experiments . The rate of oxidation of a reactive peptide depends on the reactivity of the side - chain groups to hydroxyl radical attack and their solvent accessibility . The most reactive amino acids are usually sulfur - containing and aromatic residues . We calculated surface accessibility to identify which primary target residues were likely to be modified in the apo - Arp2 / 3 complex ( Table 1 ) . Several segments of Arp2 are disordered in the crystal structures , so we could not calculate their surface accessibility . Of the 50 Met residues in the Table 1 .

Of these 50 methionine residues , 20 were detected to be oxidized in these experiments ( (cid:1) 40 % ) , whereas the other methionine residues were not modified due to minimal surface accessibility ; (cid:1) 10 % of the methionine residues were on peptides that were never identified ( Table 1 ) . The remaining residues observed to be oxidized were primarily tyrosine and tryptophan , with a few observed oxidations of proline . In the case of the aromatics , only residues that exhibited solvent accessibilities in excess of 20 Å 2 were expected to suffer oxidation ( 22 ) and overall , this was the case . Fig . 1 B shows the 30 peptides observed to be oxidized along with the reactive residue ( s ) that were detected within the apo - Arp2 / 3 complex . The observed modified sites are distributed throughout the Arp2 / 3 complex providing multiple probes for each subunit . ATP Binding to Arp2 / 3 Complex Shows Occupancy at the Nucleotide - Binding Clefts of Arp2 and Arp3 . In the presence of 1 mM ATP , the oxidation rates for 25 of the 30 reactive peptides were identical ( within error ) to the rates observed in the absence of ATP ( Table 1 ) . However , the binding of ATP modifies the oxidation rates of five peptides ( Figs . 1 C and 2 A ) . ATP protects four of the five peptides from oxidation ( i . e . , modification rate decreases ) and increases the rate of oxidation of segment 107 – 118 of Arp2 2 - fold . Substantial decreases in the oxidation rate ranging from 2 - to 6 - fold were observedforpeptidesegments5 – 18 , 212 – 225 , and318 – 329inArp3 . Peptide300 – 316inArp2showedmodestprotectionof1 . 5 - fold . The protected peptides are clustered within Arp3 and Arp2 without any substantial changes in p40 , p34 , p21 , p20 , or p16 . We used tandem MS analysis to identify specific side chains sensitive to ATP binding ( Table 1 ) . Specifically , residues within the nucleotide clefts of Arp2 and Arp3 , including Tyr - 16 , Val - 213 , Pro - 217 , and Met - 327 from Arp3 , as well as Met - 309 from Arp2 , were less reactive with bound nucleotide . For Arp3 , the protections within the cleft between subdomains 1 and 4 indicate partial cleft closure ( 23 ) . These localized changes in the solution structure of Arp2 / 3 complex are consistent with differences in the conforma - tions of Arp3 in crystals with and without bound nucleotide ( 12 ) . In addition , within Arp2 , protection from oxidation was observed in the interface of subdomains 3 and 4 ( peptide 300 – 316 ) , whereas probe sites within subdomains 1 and 2 did not change their reactivity upon ATP binding . This represents entirely new exper - imental information , because subdomains 1 and 2 of Arp2 are not observed in any crystal structures ( 12 ) . FRET data of Goley et al . ( 11 ) demonstrate that nucleotide binding induces conformational changes in Arp2 / 3 in solution ; our results indicate that the primary sites of conformational change are located adjacent to five probe sites within Arp2 and 3 as twenty five additional probe sites located throughout the complex did not change their reactivity . Further - more , (cid:2) 160additionalpeptidesthatwereroutinelydetecteddidnot show oxidation in the presence of nucleotide , thus the surface areas of their potentially reactive residues are not exposed to solvent as a result of ATP binding .

This nearly saturated Arp2 / 3 complex with WASp so that any ligand - induced conformational changes could be examined ( see Methods ) . Seven of the 30 peptides that exhibited oxidation had reduced oxidation rates in the presence of WASp VCA compared with ATP binding alone ( Figs . 1 D and 2 B ) . These protected peptides are located in Arp3 , including segments 80 – 91 , 162 – 191 , and 318 – 329 , and in Arp2 including segments 54 – 65 , 66 – 80 , 87 – 97 , and 300 – 316 . The observed decreases in oxidation rate for Arp3 segment 162 – 191 and Arp2 segments 66 – 80 and 87 – 97 were 3 - to 5 - fold ; prior footprinting experiments suggest protections of this magnitude are characteristic of burial in a well protected interface ( 15 , 19 , 24 ) . Tandem MS analysis identified specific residues that are protected from oxidation in the Arp / WASp complex . These side - chain residues include Met - 89 , Tyr - 184 , and Met - 327 in Arp3 and Met - 56 , Met - 67 , Tyr - 72 , Met - 74 , Trp - 89 , and Met - 309 in Arp2 ( Fig . 1 D ) . Binding of WASp VCA did not change the rate of oxidation of other subunits in the complex . Several of the reactive residues we identified were predicted by homology modeling to be potential interaction sites where WASp binds Arp2 / 3 . For example , sequence analysis and mod - eling studies ( 25 ) predicted that Met - 327 and Phe - 328 on subdomain 3 of Arp3 should have altered solvent accessibility upon nucleotide binding and form a site for WASp binding . We see that Met - 327 is protected upon nucleotide binding and exhibits additional protection upon WASp binding . In addition , conserved residues within sequences 154 – 161 are adjacent to Tyr - 184 that shows WASp - dependent protection ( 25 ) . Probes on the back of the Arp2 subdomain 2 ( e . g . , Arg - 42 , Leu - 55 , Met - 56 , Leu - 64 , Ser - 66 , Asn - 71 , and Asp - 90 ) were also suggested as candidates for binding WASp . Note that the Arp2 residues Met - 56 , Met - 67 , Tyr - 72 , Met - 74 , and Trp - 89 , exhibited a pro - tection from oxidation on WASp VCA binding . A number of biochemical and biophysical approaches , including cross - linking ( 26 – 28 ) , NMR ( 27 , 29 ) , fluorescence ( 30 ) , and FRET studies ( 11 ) have been used to examine the contact sites of WASp on Arp2 / 3 complex . Specifically , chemical cross - linking studies ( 26 ) favor binding of the A segment of WASp to Arp3 . Furthermore , recently published NMR and cross - linking data suggest that a bivalentinteractionofCAregionswiththeArp2 / 3complexstabilize activated Arp2 / 3 complex through interactions with Arp2 , Arp3 , ARPC1 and ARPC3 ( 27 ) . However , site - directed spin labeling data only indicate that the regions of CA are within 25 Å of ARPC3 , and not necessarily at the binding site ( 27 ) . Modeling studies predicted that a patch of 46 conserved residues on ARPC1 / p40 might be a potential binding site for WASp ( 25 ) , however our experiments do not observe any conformational changes as function of WASp binding in this region . Overall , these results , combined with sequence analysis and modeling studies indicate that WASp VCA mediates interactions between the two Arp subunits by crosslinking Arp3 and Arp2 . In particular the level of protection seen for Arp3 residue M327 and Y184 , and Arp2 residues M67 , Y72 , M74 , and W89 suggest they are critical buried sites in the Arp2 / 3 WASp binding interface . Furthermore , we suggest that WASp - dependent protections from oxidation for segments 80 – 91 ( Arp3 ) and segments 54 – 65 and 300 – 316 ( Arp2 ) are related to physical contact between the Arps related to dimer formation . Residues of WASp VCA That Interact with Arp2 / 3 Complex . To identify residues in the WASp VCA domain that interact with Arp2 / 3 complex , we carried out oxidation experiments with 10 (cid:1) M Arp2 / 3 complexand1 (cid:1) MWASpVCA ( residues432 – 502 ) tosaturatemost of the WASp with Arp2 / 3 complex . Samples were exposed for 0 – 80 ms to the x - ray beam , subjected to proteolysis and analysis by mass spectrometry . Three peptides of WASp including 447 – 472 and 447 – 476 located in the C region and 480 – 502 ( mostly ) from the A regionwereoxidizedbasedonourLC - MSanalysis ( Table2andFig . 3 ) . Peptide 447 – 472 was oxidized at approximately the same rate in the presence of excess Arp 2 / 3 complex as free WASp VCA . Arp2 / 3 complex decreased the rate of oxidation of segment 447 – 476 by 83 % and of peptide 480 – 502 by 33 % . These results are consistent with previous biochemical ( 30 ) data and NMR line broadening results ( 29 ) indicating that both the C and A regions of WASp bind Arp2 / 3 complex . Specifically , Arp2 / 3 binding caused consistent broadening of resonances predominantly in the distal A sequence andthroughout (cid:1) 15continuousresidues ( 465 – 483ofWASp ) ofthe C region ( 29 ) . CID MS / MS analysis showed that Arp2 / 3 complex protected Met - 474 and Trp - 500 but not Met - 471 . Substitution of Met - 475 within residues 467 – 481 of N - WASp ( equivalent to Met - 474 of WASp ) to Ala leads loss of nucleation promoting activity ( 29 ) . Our results confirm the burial of Met - 474 ( C region ) in the WASp interaction with Arp2 / 3 . Binding to Arp2 / 3 complex has a very interesting effect on the oxidationofTrp - 500 . OxidationofWASpVCAproducedboth (cid:6) 16 and (cid:6) 32 Da products in the absence of Arp2 / 3 complex , but only the (cid:6) 32 Da product in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex . The overall modification rate constant for oxidation of isolated WASp was 5 . 8 (cid:5) 0 . 6 s (cid:4) 1 . This value can be deconvolved into individual rates of 0 . 9 (cid:5) 0 . 07 s (cid:4) 1 for the (cid:6) 16 Da product and 4 . 6 (cid:5) 0 . 7 s (cid:4) 1 for the A r p 3 A r p 3 A r p 2 A r p 2 p 40 p 40 p 34 p 34 p 21 p 21 p 20 p 20 p 16 p 16 M od i f i c a t i on R a t e s ( s - 1 ) A r p 2 A r p 2 A r p 3 A r p 3 p 40 p 40 p 34 p 34 p 21 p 21 p 20 p 20 p 16 p 16 M od i f i c a t i on R a t e s ( s - 1 ) A B Fig . 2 .

In the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex , the modification rate for the C - terminal peptide was 4 . 1 (cid:5) 0 . 2 s (cid:4) 1 and only the (cid:6) 32 Da species was produced . Thus , Arp2 / 3 complex selectively suppressed the production of the (cid:6) 16 oxidation species . MS / MS analysis of the doubly protonated ion for peptide 480 – 502 indicated that Trp - 500 was the only residue within this peptide modified in the radiolysis experiment [ see supporting information ( SI ) Fig . 5 ] . Allb 6 – 18 ionsareobservedtobeunchangedwithrespect to the unmodified peptide fragment , whereas y 3 – 17 ions are shifted by (cid:6) 16 or (cid:6) 32 Da for one or two oxygen products , respectively . This finding indicates that oxidation took place at the C - terminal end of this peptide . Further examination of the ion series revealed that the doubly protonated b 202 (cid:6) ion remained unchanged , whereas the b 212 (cid:6) ion showed modified products of (cid:6) 16 and (cid:6) 32 Da . Close examination of the chemical mechanism of tryptophan oxidation explained why the (cid:6) 16 - Da product disappears when WASp VCA binds Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4 ) . During radiolysis , hydroxyl radicals attack tryptophan side chains at the benzene and pyrrole rings ; these results in (cid:6) 16 - Da mass changes in the first case and (cid:6) 32 - Da mass changes in the latter case due to the high reactivity of the pyrrole ring to subsequent oxidation upon initial oxidative attack ( 31 , 32 ) . Interaction of the benzene ring of Trp - 500 with Arp2 / 3 complex protects this part of the side chain from oxidation , while leaving the pyrrole ring susceptible to oxidation leading to the N - formylkynurenine product . This mechanism ex - plainsoppositeeffectsofsaturatingconcentrationsofArp2 / 3onthe (cid:6) 16 - and (cid:6) 32 - Da products as well as the modest decrease in oxidation rate . Overall , our data suggest that Arp2 / 3 complex interacts with WASp within the C region with Met - 474 and A region at Trp - 500 through direct burial of the benzene ring . Conclusion We demonstrate the ability of the hydroxyl radical - mediated pro - tein footprinting combined with mass spectrometry to examine the nature of protein – protein interactions and allosteric changes in conformation induced by ligand binding in a large ( 220 kDa ) and complexmacromolecularassembly . Moreover , thisapproachallows the study of protein surfaces under a variety of solution conditions at micromolar concentrations of analyte with resolution at the level of single side chains . Data presented here suggest conformational changes within Arp2 / 3 complex on ATP binding in Arp3 ( localized in peptides 5 – 18 , 212 – 225 , and 318 – 327 ) and Arp2 ( within peptide 300 – 316 ) . These data are consistent with nucleotide docking within the nucleotide clefts of the actin related proteins promoting a cleft closure for the Arp3 subunit . Our data also suggest a bivalent WASp interaction site that anchors Arp3 ( within peptide segments 162 – 191 and 318 – 329 ) and Arp2 ( within peptide segments 66 – 80 and 87 – 97 ) . WASp - dependent protections from oxidation within other peptides suggest domain rearrangements of Arp2 and Arp3 resulting in a closed conformational state consistent with an ‘‘actin - dimer’’ model . Our conclusion also is very consistent with EM ( 14 ) and modeling data ( 25 ) , as well as FRET experiments ( 11 ) that indicate that Arp2 / 3 complex undergoes a substantial confor - mational change and that Arp2 and Arp3 adopt an actin - short - pitch dimer configuration ( 33 ) . In addition , the Arp2 / 3 complex contacts WASp within the C subdomain at residue Met 474 and within the A subdomain to Trp 500 . Methods Arp2 / 3 Complex Preparation . Nucleotide - free Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from bovine thymus as described by Higgs et al . ( 13 , 34 ) . It was further dialyzed against 10 mM cacodylic acid sodium salt trihydrate , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 25 mM KCl ( pH 7 ) at 4°C for 24 h . Protein concentrations were determined by using the molar ab - sorptivity for Arp2 / 3 complex ( (cid:2) 290 (cid:7) 139000 M (cid:4) 1 cm (cid:4) 1 ) . Nucleotide - bound complex was made by adding ATP to a final Table 2 .

Arp2 / 3 complex bound to ATP and WASp were prepared by adding 10 (cid:1) M WASp to 1 (cid:1) M Arp2 / 3 complex in 1 mM ATP . For all experiments without WASp , the Arp2 / 3 complex concentration was adjusted to 1 (cid:1) M . A 5 - (cid:1) l portion of each protein solution was dispensed into a 0 . 7 - ml tube for radiolysis . The K d of WASP VCA for Arp2 / 3 complex is 0 . 9 (cid:1) M ( 30 ) . Thus , our biochemical conditions of complex formation ( 10 (cid:8) excess of one component ) assure (cid:2) 90 % occupancy of the binding sites of interest . WASp VCA Preparation . GST - WASp , which includes only the VCA region of bovine WASp ( 432 – 502 ) , was prepared according to Marchand et al . ( 30 ) but without an N - terminal cysteine . The WASp was further dialyzed against 10 mM cacodylic acid sodium salt trihydrate , 1 mM MgCl 2 ( pH 7 ) . The molar absorptivity at 280 nm of 46200 M (cid:4) 1 cm (cid:4) 1 was used to determine the GST - WASp concentration . Radiolysis . Radiolysis experiments were performed at beamline X - 28C of the National Synchrotron Light Source , Brookhaven National Laboratory . Exposure times were controlled by using an electronic shutter ( Vincent Associates , Rochester , NY ) . All exper - iments were performed at a ring energy of 2 . 8 GeV and at a beam currents ranging between 195 and 225 mA according to published procedures ( 35 , 36 ) . All experiments were performed at ambient temperature . Proteolysis and MS Analysis . Radiolyzed protein complex was di - gested with sequencing grade modified trypsin at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1 : 50 ( wt / wt ) at 37°C for 12 h . The digestion reaction was terminated by freezing the samples . Using a column switching technique mediated by a Switchos module ( LC Packings , Sunny - vale , CA ) , the resulting peptides ( 800 fmol ) were loaded onto a 300 (cid:1) m ID (cid:8) 5 mm C18 , PepMap RP trapping column to preconcen - trate and wash away excess salts . The loading flow of the Switchos was set to 30 (cid:1) l / min , with 0 . 1 % formic acid as the loading solvent . Reverse phase separation was performed on a 75 (cid:1) m ID (cid:8) 15 cm C18 , PepMap column using the UltiMate nano separation system ( LC Packings ) . Buffer A ( 95 % water , 5 % acetonitrile , and 0 . 1 % formic acid ) and buffer B ( 5 % water , 95 % acetonitrile , and 0 . 1 % formic acid ) were used to design a gradient . Proteolitic peptides eluted from the column with the gradient of acetonitrile of 1 % per min were directed to a Thermo Finnigan ( San Jose , CA ) quadru - pole ion trap mass spectrometer ( DecaXP Plus ) equipped with a nano - spray ion source and with the needle voltage of 1 . 8 kV . All mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode . The detected ion currents were used to determine the extent of oxidation by separate quantitation of the unmodified proteolytic peptides and their radiolytic products . The sites of oxidation were determined from MS / MS experiment . MS / MS data of the peptide mixtures were searched against bovine database for the oxidation of the tryptic peptides from bovine Arp2 / 3 complex using BioWorks 3 . 2 software ( Thermo Electron , San Jose , CA ) . In addition , detected product – ion spectra for modified peptides were manually verified and correlated with hypothetical product - ion spectra predicted for the proteolysis products of the Arp2 / 3 . Because methionine is very reactive , and comprises most of the probes in this study , its accurate quantitation is very important to the validity of the results . We have determined that after radiolysis up to 90 % of methionine oxidation is mediated by H 2 O 2 and other stable radical species produced during exposure ( 37 ) . To eliminate these secondary oxidations , 10 mM Met - NH 2 xHCl buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) is added immediately after irradiation to all samples to quench methionine oxidation not induced by primary hydroxyl radical attack . Modification Rate Calculation . The integrated areas of unmodified and modified peptide ions , obtained from the total ion current , were used to calculate the modification extent as described ( 35 ) . The fraction unmodified peptide was fit to the equation Y (cid:7) Y 0 e (cid:4) kt using the Origin 6 . 0 ( Microcal Software , Northampton , MA ) program , where Y and Y 0 are the fraction of unmodified peptide at a time t and 0 ( seconds ) , respectively and k is a first - order rate constant . Dose – response curves are presented as unmodified frac - tion ( plotted on a logarithmic scale ) versus x - ray exposure time . Side Chain Solvent Accessibility Calculation . To verify the correlation of side - chain reactivity and solvent accessibility for modified resi - dues for Arp2 / 3 complex , the solvent accessibility surface areas of all side - chains were calculated in Å 2 . The VADAR computer program ( PENCE , University of Alberta , Edmonton , Canada ) ; the crystal structure of the apo - form of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Protein Data Bank ID code 1K8K ) was used for this analysis .
