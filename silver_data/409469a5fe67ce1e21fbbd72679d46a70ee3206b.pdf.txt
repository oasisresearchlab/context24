Three of the I - BAR proteins , including insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate ( IRTKS ) , contain an SH3 domain near their C - termini . Yet , the function of the SH3 domain of IRTKS remains uncharacterized . Here we report that in contrast to MIM , which is a prototype of I - BAR proteins and does not contain an SH3 domain , IRTKS promoted serum - induced cell migration along with enhanced phosphorylation of mitogen activated kinases Erk1 / 2 and p38 , and activation of small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 . In addition , cells overexpressing IRTKS exhibited an increased polarity characterized by elongated cytoplasm and extensive lamellipodia at leading edges . However , a mutant with deletion of the SH3 domain attenuated both cellular motility and p38 phos - phorylation but had little effect on Erk1 / 2 phosphorylation . Also , a chimeric mutant in which the N - terminal portion of MIM is fused with the C - terminal IRTKS , including the SH3 domain , was able to promote chemotactic response to serum and cellular polarity . In contrast , a chimeric mutant in which the N - terminal IRTKS is fused with the C - terminal MIM failed to do so . Furthermore , treatment of cells with SB203580 , a selective inhibitor of p38 , also neutralized the effect of IRTKS on cell migration . These data indicate that the SH3 domain distinguishes the function of IRTKS in promoting cell migration and inducing signal transduction from those of SH3 - less I - BAR proteins . © 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc . 1 . Introduction Cell migration is fundamental to development , wound healing , cell - cell communication and immune surveillance , and is associ - ated with extensive membrane dynamics , including extension at leading edges , generation of new adhesion sites , and detachment of adhesions at cell rear position [ 1 ] . Many of these cellular processes are subjected to the control by Rho - like small GTPases , such as Rac1 and Cdc42 , which direct the process of cell polarization and directional migration through their effects on the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton [ 2 ] . Also , MAP kinases Erk1 / 2 and p38 have been implicated in the migration of various types of cells [ 3 ] . In addition to these well - characterized signaling molecules , There is emerging evidence for the important role of a protein family that shares a Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) domain in cell migration and cell shape changes [ 4 ] . The BAR domain is a dimeric motif that binds to phospholipid membranes through a curved interface . Depending on the shape of the interface , the BAR proteins can be divided into three subfamilies , classical BAR , F - BAR and I - BAR domain proteins . While the former two subfamilies induce membrane invagination , the I - BAR domain has a concave shape and induces membrane protrusion [ 5 ] . The mammalian genomes contain ﬁ ve I - BAR domain genes , encoding IRSp53 , MIM , ABBA , IRTKS and PINKBAR , respec - tively [ 6 ] . Among them , IRTKS , IRSp53 and PINKBAR are distin - guished from others by having an SH3 domain . The best characterized function of the I - BAR protein - associated SH3 domain is the one with IRSp53 , which interacts with proline rich sequences of a wide range of actin cytoskeleton - associated proteins , including * Corresponding author .

Li , et al . , The SH3 domain distinguishes the role of I - BAR proteins IRTKS and MIM in chemotactic response to serum , Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications ( 2016 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . bbrc . 2016 . 09 . 131 WAVE2 [ 7 ] , Mena [ 8 ] , Dia1 [ 9 ] and Eps8 [ 10 ] . As these proteins are implicated in the assembly of actin ﬁ laments in the cortex such as lamellipodia at cell leading edges , the SH3 domain provides pre - sumably a functional link between IRSp53 and the actin dynamics . In contrast to IRsp53 , the function of the SH3 domain of IRTKS , which is also known as brain - speci ﬁ c angiogenesis inhibitor 1 - associated protein 2 - like 1 ( BAIAP2L1 ) , remains elusive . Although IRTKS is closely related to IRSp53 , its SH3 domain is not apparently required for its recruitment to lamellipodia [ 11 ] . Nevertheless , IRTKS may use its SH3 domain to link to the actin cytoskeleton as evidenced by its ability to Escherichia coli secreted F - like protein encoded on prophage U , which triggers the actin assembly to facilitate bacterial invasion into host cells [ 12 ] . In addition , IRTKS is implicated in plasma membrane dynamics and actin bundling associated with cell shape changes , migration and proliferation [ 5 ] . Mice with depletion of the IRTKS gene showed insulin resistance symptoms such as glucose intolerance , hyperglycemia , insulin less - sensitivity , hyperinsulinemia , and excessive production of hepatic glucose [ 13 ] . Furthermore , IRTKS suppresses innate immune re - sponses against RNA virus through the Rig - IMAVs signaling pathway , thereby down - regulating extravagant in ﬂ ammation [ 14 ] . IRTKS is also involved in tumor progression and has been reported to inhibit the p53 induced apoptosis by direct regulating its tran - scriptional activity [ 15 ] . However , there is little known about the cellular function of IRTKS that is relevant to these reported phenomena . As an effort to understand the distinct function of I - BAR pro - teins , we compared IRTKS with MIM and found that while MIM inhibits cell migration in response to serum , IRTKS promotes chemotactic response and cell polarization . Importantly , we found that the IRTKS - mediated cell migration and polarization is depen - dent upon its SH3 domain . Thus , the SH3 domain is the primary motif that functionally distinguishes I - BAR domain proteins . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cell culture and DNA transfection HeLa cells were cultured under 5 % CO 2 , 37 (cid:1) C in Dulbecco ' s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM ) ( Corning , NY ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Hyclone , Logan , UT ) and 100 unit / ml Penicillin and Streptomycin . DNA transfection was performed with cells at 90 % con ﬂ uence by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent ( Active Motif , Carlsbad , CA ) with the protocol recommended by manufacturer ' s instruction . Stable transfected cells were selected in the medium containing 0 . 5 mg / ml G418 for two weeks with constant medium changes every three days . The selected cells were pooled together and used for all the analyses as described . 2 . 2 . Plasmids Plasmids encoding MIM - GFP and GFP were prepared as described previously [ 16 ] . pIRTKS - GFP was synthesized and cloned into the vector pEZ - M98 by Genecopoeia ( Gaithersburg , MD ) . pIRTKS D SH3 , which encodes a protein with a deletion of the SH3 domain ( aa 342 e 399 ) , was prepared by using a QuikChange Site - Directed Mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) using pIRTKS - GFP as the template . To prepare pIRTKS - I - BAR - MIM - CT - GFP , a DNA sequence that has an open reading frame corresponding to the human IRTKS protein from aa 1 to 231 and human MIM protein from aa 235 to 755 was synthesized by GeneScript ( Nanjing , China ) and cloned into pUC57 vector . This DNA sequence is also ﬂ anked by a HindIII site at the 5 0 and a BamH1 site at the 3 0 , respectively . After digestion with HindIII and BamH1 , the insert was subcloned into pEZ - M98 . To prepare pMIM - I - BAR - IRTKS - CT - GFP , a DNA sequence that is ﬂ anked by HindIII and BamH1 sites and has an open reading frame corresponding to human MIM protein from aa 1 to 250 and human IRTKS protein from aa 250 to 511 was synthesized by GeneScript . This DNA fragment was also subcloned into pEZ - M98 as above . For all the mutants , the ﬁ delity of the mutations was con ﬁ rmed by DNA sequencing . 2 . 3 . Analysis of phosphorylated p38 and Erk1 / 2 The level of phosphorylated MAP Kinases p38 and Erk1 / 2 was measured by Western blot assay using antibodies against specif - ically pp38 and pErk1 / 2 , as described previously [ 3 ] . 2 . 4 . Rac1 and Cdc42 activation assay To measure GTP - Rac1 and GTP - Cdc42 , equal amount of cell ly - sates was precipitated with 20 m l 50 % GST - PAK - CRIB agarose beads ( Millipore , MA ) . Samples were separated by 15 % SDS - PAGE and subjected to Western blot using antibodies against Rac1 or Cdc42 [ 3 ] . 2 . 5 . Cell migration assay Cell migration was evaluated by Transwell assay as described previously [ 3 ] . 2 . 6 . Analysis of cell morphology Images of cells were captured by digital camera QImaging MicroPublisher 5 . 0 RTV that is equipped on Nikon Eclipse TE2000 - U microscope and controlled by MetaMorph software . Cell elon - gation factor was determined according to Frances [ 17 ] . Brie ﬂ y , the long axis was de ﬁ ned as the longest length of the cell , and the length across the nucleus in a direction perpendicular to the long axis was recognized as the short axis . The elongation factor was de ﬁ ned as the ratio of two axes . Both axes were measured by ImageJ software . 2 . 7 . Statistical analysis All the data were subjected to two tailed Student ' s t - test by using GraphPad Prism software . A difference with a P value < 0 . 01 was considered as statistically signi ﬁ cant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . IRTKS promoted cell migration in response to serum To evaluate the effect of IRTKS on cell motility , cells expressing IRTKS - GFP and cells expressing GFP only were subjected to Trans - well assay for chemotactic response to serum at different concen - trations for various times . In the absence of serum , less than 2 % of both cell types was migrated in 16 h ( Fig . 1A ) . In the presence of serum , both control cells and IRTKS expressing cells showed sig - ni ﬁ cant motility responses in a dose dependent manner , which reached to a maximal level at 15 % serum ( Fig . 1A ) . However , the number of migrated IRTKS - GFP cells was nearly 2 and half of that of control cells at the maximal level . When cell migration towards 15 % serum was analyzed for different times , IRTKS - GFP cells also showed a greater migration rate than did control cells during the period from 8 to 24 h ( Fig . 1B ) . As a comparison , we also analyzed cells expressing GFP - tagged MIM protein . As shown in Fig . 1C and D , MIM - GFP cells showed a lower response to serum under the same condition compared with cells expressing GFP only . This L .

The differential response to serum with IRTKS and MIM over - expressors prompted us to seek the structural basis for their functional difference . Compared to MIM , IRTKS is distinguished by having an SH3 domain at the C - terminal ( CT ) domain ( Fig . 1E ) . To examine whether the CT domain is responsible for the difference , we switched the N - terminal domain ( NT ) and the CT domain of MIM and IRTKS each other , resulting in two chimeric mutants : MIM - I - BAR - IRTKS - CT - GFP , and IRTKS - I - BAR - MIM - CT - GFP . HeLa cells expressing each mutant were analyzed by Transwell assay for motility response to 15 % FBS for different times . As shown in Fig . 1F , cells expressing MIM - I - BAR - IRTKS - CT - GFP displayed a response at a level comparable to that of IRTKS - GFP cells . In contrast , IRTKS - I - BAR - MIM - CT - GFP cells reduced motility response as did MIM - GFP cells . To further con ﬁ rm the role of the SH3 domain in cell migra - tion , we also generated a mutant IRTKS D SH3 - GFP , which had a deletion of the SH3 domain . When the cells expressing the mutant were analyzed for the response to serum by Transwell , we found that the cells also showed a poor mobility response ( Fig . 1F ) . Hence , the SH3 domain determines the response of cells expressing I - BAR proteins to serum . 3 . 2 . IRTKS promoted activation of MAPKs , Rac1 and Cdc42 We next examined several signaling molecules commonly involved in cell migration , including MAP kinases p38 and Erk1 / 2 , and small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 . In response to serum stimu - lation , phosphorylation of p38 in cells expressing IRTKS - GFP was greatly enhanced by nearly 3 folds within 15 min compared with that in cells expressing GFP only ( Fig . 2A ) . In contrast , the level of p38 phosphorylation in the cells expressing MIM - GFP after expo - sure to serum was about half of that in control cells ( Fig . 2A ) . However , both IRTKS - GFP and MIM - GFP expressing cells displayed remarkable increase in phosphorylation of Erk1 / 2 although the increase was more dramatic in IRTKS - GFP cells ( Fig . 2B ) . Likewise , the serum - induced increase in GTP - Rac1 and GTP - Cdc42 was more signi ﬁ cant in IRTKS - GFP cells than in control cells ( Fig . 2C and D ) . On the other hand , MIM - GFP cells showed less increase in the levels of GTP - Rac1 and GTP - Cdc42 than those in control cells under the same condition ( Fig . 2C and E ) . Thus , IRTKS promoted the activation of these signaling molecules , whereas MIM suppressed them except of Erk1 / 2 . 3 . 3 . The SH3 domain is responsible for p38 phosphorylation and cell migration We were interested in the role of the SH3 domain in the IRTKS - mediated signal transduction with focusing on p38 and Erk1 / 2 by examining cells expressing IRTKS D SH3 - GFP cells . As shown in Fig . 3A , overexpression of IRTKS D SH3 - GFP nearly abolished the phosphorylation of p38 in response to serum . In contrast , the mutant showed no effect on the phosphorylation of Erk1 / 2 ( Fig . 3B ) , suggesting that the SH3 domain is more involved in activation of p38 than Erk1 / 2 . To examine any functional relation - ship between p38 and IRTKS - mediated cell migration , we treated cells expressing IRTKS - GFP with SB203580 , a compound that in - hibits both p38a and p38b , prior to serum stimulation . This treat - ment blocked not only p38 phosphorylation ( Fig . 3A ) but also inhibited serum - mediated cell migration to the degree similar to that as shown with the cells expressing IRTKS D SH3 - GFP ( Fig . 3C ) . Therefore , the SH3 domain promoted IRTKS - mediated cell migra - tion in a p38 phosphorylation dependent manner . 3 . 4 . IRTKS induced cell shape changes in a manner depending upon its SH3 domain I - BAR proteins are known to induce profoundly cell shape changes , and thus we inspected HeLa cells expressing MIM - GFP and different IRTKS mutants after staining with phalloidin , a chemical that stains speci ﬁ cally stress ﬁ bers . Compared to control cells expressing GFP only ( Fig . 4A ) , cells expressing either IRTKS - GFP or MIM - GFP displayed signi ﬁ cantly shape changes . Over 90 % of MIM - GFP cells exhibited extensive ﬁ lopodia - like protrusions ( white arrow heads ) , whereas over 90 % of cells expressing IRTKS - GFP displayed elongated cytoplasm with extensive lamellipodia at the leading edge ( Fig . 4A , yellow arrow head ) . However , cells expressing IRTKS D SH3 - GFP failed to show the similar elongated shape ( Fig . 4B ) . Also , we analyzed cells expressing MIM - I - BAR - IRTKS - CT - GFP , which apparently exhibited elongated cytoplasm as well as ﬁ lopodia - like extension but few lamellipodia at leading edges ( Fig . 4B ) . In contrast , cells expressing IRTKS - I - BAR - MIM - CT - GFP showed neither extensive lamellipodia at cell leading edges nor elongated cytoplasm ( Fig . 4B ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of shape changes based on elongation factor demonstrated that cells expressing IRTKS - GFP had an elongation factor more than twice as that of control cells , whereas cells expressing MIM - GFP had a smallest elongation factor ( Fig . 4C ) .

Taken together , the SH3 domain plays an important role in the IRTKS - mediated cell shape changes . 4 . Discussion In this presented study we showed that overexpression of IRTKS had a dramatic impact on serum - induced chemotaxis , activations of p38 , Erk1 / 2 , Rac1 and Cdc42 , and cell shape changes . The ﬁ nding that IRTKS promotes cell migration is consistent with other reports showing that IRTKS was overexpressed in certain metastatic lesions and that IRTKS upregulated the motility of HT1080 cancer cells [ 19 ] . Signi ﬁ cantly , we found that the SH3 domain is indispensable for IRTKS - mediated cell migration . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst report about a functional link between the SH3 domain of IRTKS and cell migration . Although the direct partners for the SH3 domain of IRTKS have not yet been characterized , the SH3 domain of IRSp53 , which is closely related to IRTKS , is known to bind to Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and WASP - family ver - prolin - homologous ( WAVE ) proteins [ 20 ] . Both WASP and WAVE proteins are the activators for the Arp2 / 3 complex , the primary actin nucleator responsible for the assembly of the branched actin ﬁ laments that are enriched in the lamellipodia at cell leading edges , which are often associated with the initiation of cell migration . We speculate that the SH3 domain of IRTKS may have a similar function to interact with an actin cytoskeleton associated protein that is involved in actin reorganization , and thereby promoting cell migration . In contrast , MIM does not have an SH3 domain . Instead , it has a proline - rich domain that is known to bind to cortactin , which also has an activity to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex by sta - bilizing its association with actin ﬁ laments [ 21 ] . However , the function of MIM in the actin assembly varies signi ﬁ cantly depending on the Arp2 / 3 complex activators . While MIM promotes cortactin / Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly , it inhibits N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization [ 18 ] . Since N - WASP is the primary Arp2 / 3 complex activator , overexpression of MIM often results in inhibition of cell migration . Recently , we also reported that MIM is implicated in the internalization of chemokine receptor CXCR4 [ 3 ] , the pathway that leads to downregulation of CXCR4 signaling . While it is unclear about the primary factor ( s ) in the serum responsible for the observed chemotaxis of HeLa cells , MIM could also promote its endocytosis as well , thereby inhibiting the motility response to them . Deletion of the SH3 domain also led to the failure to induce p38 phosphorylation , which is necessary for the serum - mediated cell migration . Interestingly , the SH3 domain was not required for enhanced Erk1 / 2 phosphorylation in response to serum , indicating that different mechanisms are used by IRTKS to enhance these two MAPKs and that p38 phosphorylation , rather than Erk1 / 2 phos - phorylation , is responsible for the IRTKS - mediated cell migration . Yet , the nature for these mechanisms is currently unknown although it is speculated that a common feature shared by IRTKS and MIM may be responsible for Erk1 / 2 phosphorylation . Indeed , the I - BAR domains of both IRTKS and MIM are known to bind to small GTPase Rac1 [ 22 , 23 ] , activation of which could lead to acti - vation of Erk1 / 2 . In addition to Rac1 , IRTKS was recently reported to interact with small GTPase Rif by its I - BAR domain [ 24 ] . Hence , it is quite possible that IRTKS and MIM could bind to different small GTPases , which may in ﬂ uence profoundly their subsequent signaling under different cellular contexts . In addition to cell migration , we found that overexpression of IRTKS and MIM induced different cell shape changes . While over - expression of MIM promotes the formation of ﬁ lopodia - like microspikes , overexpression of IRTKS caused cellular polarization with extremely extended the cytoplasm and increased lamellipodia at the leading edges . Again , the formation of such polarity is dependent upon the SH3 domain . Of note , the chimeric mutant with N - terminal MIM and C - terminal IRTKS also showed increased cell polarity but without extensive lammellipodia formation , sug - gesting that there is a coordination between the SH3 domain and the I - BAR domain , and that different I - BAR domains have different functions . Indeed , IRTKS binds membranes mainly based on elec - trostatic interaction , whereas an amphipathic helix in MIM I - BAR is inserted into membrane bilayers , facilitating more ef ﬁ cient mem - brane bending [ 25 ] . These differences could explain speci ﬁ c func - tion of each I - BAR protein . For example , IRTKS induces dorsal membrane ruf ﬂ es [ 24 ] and is associated with invadopodia in cancer cells and podosomes in osteoclasts [ 26 ] . In contrast , MIM induces ﬁ lopodia - like protrusions when it is overexpressed [ 27 ] . These differences highlight a necessity to characterize the physiological function of each I - BAR protein under different cellular contexts . Author contribution L . L . and X .
