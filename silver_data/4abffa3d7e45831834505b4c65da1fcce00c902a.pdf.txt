METHOD Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s13059 - 023 - 03025 - 5 Genome Biology LAST - seq : single - cell RNA sequencing by direct amplification of single - stranded RNA without prior reverse transcription and second - strand synthesis Jun Lyu 1 and Chongyi Chen 1 * Abstract Existing single - cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA - seq ) methods rely on reverse transcription ( RT ) and second - strand synthesis ( SSS ) to convert single - stranded RNA into double - stranded DNA prior to amplification , with the limited RT / SSS efficiency compromising RNA detectability . Here , we develop a new scRNA - seq method , Linearly Amplified Single - stranded - RNA - derived Transcriptome sequencing ( LAST - seq ) , which directly amplifies the original single - stranded RNA molecules without prior RT / SSS . LAST - seq offers a high single - molecule capture efficiency and a low level of technical noise for single - cell transcriptome analyses . Using LAST - seq , we characterize transcriptional bursting kinetics in human cells , revealing a role of topologically associating domains in transcription regulation . Background Single - cell transcriptome analyses have been driven by the invention of scRNA - seq methods [ 1 – 5 ] . Recent technical advances have focused on improving the performance of digital counting by unique molecular identifiers ( UMIs ) [ 6 – 8 ] , enhancing the cellular throughput while lowering the cost [ 9 – 17 ] , optimizing individual steps in the protocol [ 8 , 18 , 19 ] , and miniaturization [ 19 – 21 ] . The underlying chemistry , however , remains unchanged and depends on the same fundamental step of RT / SSS prior to the amplifica - tion of single - stranded RNA ( ssRNA ) molecules . While RT remains reliant on reverse transcriptase , current scRNA - seq assays employ various SSS strategies with a limited efficiency , including the use of terminal transferase [ 1 ] or template switching [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 8 ] to create cDNA priming sites for PCR , employing RNase H and DNA Pol to convert the RNA / cDNA hybrid to double - stranded DNA [ 4 , 7 ] for in vitro transcription , random annealing to the single - stranded cDNA for extension [ 22 ] , or Tn5 tagmentation of the RNA / cDNA hybrid [ 23 ] . * Correspondence : chongyi . chen @ nih . gov 1 Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , National Cancer Institute , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD 20892 , USA Page 2 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 Regardless of the specific protocol , the inevitable RT / SSS with a limited efficiency in existing scRNA - seq methods ultimately compromises the single - molecule capture effi - ciency of the original RNA molecules . Low RNA capture efficiency can lead to measure - ment inaccuracies ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S1a ) , undermining the ability to distinguish cell types with a subtle difference in the gene expression level . Low RNA capture efficiency also adds a high level of technical noise in the single - cell transcriptome data ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S1b ) , hindering accurate characterization of cell - to - cell variation and gene expression noise . To address this limitation , we developed a new scRNA - seq assay called LAST - seq . Rather than relying on the inefficient RT / SSS prior to RNA amplification , LAST - seq directly amplifies the original ssRNA molecules in single cells in a linear fashion , achiev - ing a high single - molecule capture efficiency and a low level of technical noise compared to existing scRNA - seq methods . Using LAST - seq , we characterized gene expression noise and transcriptional bursting kinetics , and investigated the regulation of transcrip - tional activities by topologically associating domains ( TADs ) in human cells . Results Efficient T7 in vitro transcription of single‑stranded RNA templates T7 in vitro transcription ( IVT ) of double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) templates to gener - ate antisense RNA ( aRNA ) [ 24 ] has been widely used to achieve linear amplification in single - cell assays [ 4 , 7 , 25 ] . Here , we tested the efficiency of T7 IVT with a 20 - nt ssRNA template as compared to a dsDNA template of the same sequence . When an 18 - bp dsDNA linker was included between the upstream T7 promoter and the down - stream ssRNA template , we found that T7 IVT was also efficient ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2a ) , consistent with a previous report that used a 14 - nt single - stranded template [ 26 ] . Moreover , T7 IVT reactions showed equal efficiency regardless of the presence of vari - ous modifications and structures at the junction site between the dsDNA linker and the ssRNA template ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2a ) . Importantly , the length of aRNA generated during the IVT of ssRNA templates could exceed the 20 - nt short distance , reaching up to 200 – 500 nt before the final falloff of the elongating polymerase from the single - stranded template ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2b ) . For the tested ssRNA templates , we observed more than 500 - fold linear amplification ~ 250 - nt downstream of the T7 promoter and close to zero - fold ~ 1000 - nt downstream of the promoter ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2c ) . The differ - ent amplicon lengths and amplification fold between the tested ssRNA templates were likely due to their distinct template sequences , as the same phenomenon was reported for the canonical T7 IVT of double - stranded DNA templates [ 27 ] . Direct linear amplification of single‑cell RNA molecules in LAST‑seq enables a high detection sensitivity Based on the observation that T7 IVT can directly amplify ssRNA templates , generating sufficiently long aRNA molecules with a reasonable linear amplification fold , we devel - oped the LAST - seq assay as an RT / SSS - free method for single - cell RNA amplification and sequencing ( Fig . 1a ) . First , the poly - A tail of each mRNA molecule in the single - cell lysate is annealed to the rU - dT overhang of a specially made LAST - seq primer ( Addi - tional file 1 : Fig . S3 ) . Next , the short patch of rA / dT hybrid is nicked and extended to Page 3 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 attach a T7 promoter to the 3 ′ - end of each mRNA molecule , which remains unchanged and in the original single - stranded status . Finally , T7 IVT of the ssRNA templates is per - formed to directly and linearly amplify each original single - cell mRNA molecule into hundreds of aRNA copies , followed by single - cell transcriptome library preparation based on the bulk - level aRNA products . We applied the LAST - seq assay to probe the transcriptome of single HEK293T cells . The LAST - seq assay showed a reasonable mapping rate ( Fig . 1b ) , a high technical Fig . 1 Workflow and performance of LAST - seq . a Schematic showing each step of the LAST - seq protocol . b Mapping rates of the LAST - seq reads to different genomic regions .

The statistical analysis was performed by Welch t - test ( * p ≤ 0 . 05 ) . i Number of detected genes in single HEK293T cells with various sequencing depths . The SEM error bar is calculated from 10 and 9 cells for LAST - seq and SMART - seq , respectively Page 4 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 reproducibility ( Fig . 1c and Additional file 1 : S4a - b ) , and an expected 3 ′ - end enrich - ment of the sequencing read coverage ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S4c ) , thus not suitable for full - length scRNA - seq studies . Notably , using the ERCC RNA spike - in mix , no signifi - cant amplification bias was detected between different RNA spike - in species ( Fig . 1d ) , suggesting a generally uniform IVT linear amplification fold of ssRNA templates in the LAST - seq assay , regardless of the template sequence . Targeting the GAPDH transcript , we estimated the linear amplification in the LAST - seq assay to be a few 100 - fold , in agreement with results from the arbitrary ssRNA templates ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S4d ) . Moreover , as predicted for the linear amplification , strong correlations were observed between the number of UMIs and the number of sequencing reads for transcriptomic RNAs ( Fig . 1e ) , with the former showed a smaller variation than the later between tech - nical replicates , demonstrating the benefit of counting UMIs to further remove ampli - fication bias ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S4e ) . Not surprisingly , the input RNA spike - in copy number correlated well with the number of corresponding sequencing reads or UMIs ( Fig . 1f , g ) , and the number of UMIs was slightly better than the number of sequencing reads to reflect the input copy number ( Fig . 1h ) . We then compared the performance of LAST - seq assay to existing scRNA - seq meth - ods , particularly the widely used SMART - seq assay , using the commercially available SMART - seqV4 kit ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S4f ) . After performing LAST - seq and SMART - seq on flow - sorted single HEK293T cells , we observed a reasonable correlation between the single - cell transcriptome generated by the two methods ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S4g ) , suggesting that LAST - seq can recapitulate the results of SMART - seq . Next , we reasoned that elimination of inefficient RT / SSS steps by direct amplification of the original RNA molecules in LAST - seq could lead to a high detection sensitivity . Indeed , LAST - seq showed a better gene detectability than SMART - seq ( Fig . 1i ) . The conclusion was fur - ther supported by the RNA spike - in experiment , where LAST - seq also demonstrated a higher detection rate of the RNA spike - in , given the same input copy number of each spike - in species ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S4h - i ) . LAST‑seq offers a high single‑molecule RNA capture efficiency Another scRNA - seq method , CEL - seq [ 4 ] , offers a higher detection sensitivity than SMART - seq in certain applications [ 28 ] . Similar to LAST - seq , CEL - seq also employs a linear amplification scheme , but CEL - seq’s linear amplification is performed on dou - ble - stranded DNA templates after RT / SSS of the original ssRNA . Here , in addition to SMART - seq , we also evaluated the performance of LAST - seq side - by - side with CEL - seq , using the improved CEL - seq2 protocol [ 7 ] . Since both methods utilize UMIs for the digital counting of detected RNA molecules , their single - molecule capture efficiencies can be quantified for a comparison . First , we carried out RNA spike - in experiments as the gold standard to quantify the single - molecule capture efficiency of scRNA - seq assays , by spiking various RNA spe - cies in the single cell to mimic the transcriptomic RNA molecules but with known input copy numbers ( Fig . 2a ) . The single - molecule capture efficiency is reflected by the ratio between the detected copy number and the input copy number of each RNA spike - in species . In addition to the commonly used ERCC RNA spike - in mix [ 29 ] , which con - tains a ~ 24 - nt poly - A tail on the 3 ′ end of each spike - in species , much shorter than Page 5 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 the poly - A tail of typical mRNA molecules in human cells [ 30 ] ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S5a ) , we also synthesized an alternative RNA spike - in mix ( A60 ) , which contains a 60 - nt 3 ′ - end poly - A tail for each RNA spike - in species to mimic human mRNA molecules ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S5b ) . Estimated from both types of RNA spike - in mix , LAST - seq offered a similar or higher single - molecule RNA capture efficiency compared to CEL - seq ( Fig . 2b , c ) . However , the difference between different RNA spike - ins also indicated that single - molecule capture efficiency quantified by RNA spike - in experiments may be biased by the poly - A tail length [ 31 ] of the spike - in species . Specifically , the higher capture efficiency of LAST - seq for A60 RNA spike - in mix was likely due to enhanced annealing between the LAST - seq primer and the long poly - A tail , stabilizing the rA / dT hybrid for more efficient RNase H nicking and T7 promoter attachment . Next , in order to evaluate the performance of both assays in capturing real transcrip - tomic RNA molecules in single human cells , we performed LAST - seq and CEL - seq on flow - sorted single HEK293T cells . First , the number of UMIs reported by both assays showed a reasonable correlation ( Fig . 2d and Additional file 1 : Fig . S5c ) , suggesting both were able to reflect the general single - cell transcriptome . After further quantification of the number of UMIs , we found LAST - seq can detect more UMIs per gene than CEL - seq for the detected genes ( Fig . 2e and Additional file 1 : Fig . S5d ) , as well as more total UMIs Fig . 2 Comparison between LAST - seq and CEL - seq . a Experimental schematic to compare LAST - seq and CEL - seq in detecting RNA spike - in species and transcriptomic RNA molecules . b Capture efficiency of LAST - seq and CEL - seq using ERCC RNA spike - in as the input , with dots representing the average number of detected UMIs from 10 and 5 replicates for LAST - seq and CEL - seq , respectively . c Capture efficiency of LAST - seq and CEL - seq using A60 RNA spike - in as the input , with dots representing the average number of detected UMIs from 10 and 5 replicates for LAST - seq and CEL - seq , respectively . d Correlation of RNA level quantified by UMI numbers between LAST - seq and CEL - seq , both averaged from 10 single cells .

The boxplot shows the median ( center line ) , the 25 / 75 percentile ( bounds ) , and the minimum / maximum ( whiskers ) . The statistical analysis was performed by the Welch t - test ( * * p ≤ 0 . 01 , * * * p ≤ 0 . 001 , * * * * p ≤ 0 . 0001 ) Page 6 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 per cell ( Fig . 2f and Additional file 1 : Fig . S5e ) , indicating a high single - molecule capture efficiency of the original RNA molecules in single cells . It is worth to note that despite LAST - seq can capture more copies of mRNA molecules per gene in single cells , the total number of genes LAST - seq can detect was compara - ble to CEL - seq ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S5f ) . We speculate that a small portion of genes may not be readily amplified by LAST - seq due to difficulties upon IVT of ssRNA tem - plates with very few copies ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S5g ) , significant secondary structure , and / or a short poly - A tail , compromising the total number of genes it can detect . On the other hand , compared to LAST - seq and SMART - seq , CEL - seq seems to be more likely to amplify and detect other types of cellular RNA in addition to the mature mRNA ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S5h ) , resulting in an elevated level of intronic and intergenic reads ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S5i ) , which was also observed in previous studies [ 28 , 32 ] , and more prone to nonspecific genomic DNA amplification upon single - cell RNA amplifica - tion and sequencing ( Additional file 2 : Table S1 ) , that will also contribute to the total number of genes it can apparently detect . Finally , we concluded that LAST - seq has a higher efficiency than CEL - seq to capture the original mRNA molecules in single cells , while the two linear - amplification - based scRNA - seq methods seem to be comparable regarding the total number of genes they can detect . Characterization of transcriptional bursting kinetics in human cells by LAST‑seq Thanks to its high RNA capture efficiency , LAST - seq offered a lower level of technical noise and more accurate transcriptome - wide profiling of the cell - to - cell variation than the commonly used SMART - seq ( Fig . 3a ) , enabling a better performance in the quantita - tive study of gene expression noise . Here , we used LAST - seq to characterize cell - to - cell variation in human cells , quantify gene expression noise of individual genes , and derive transcriptional bursting kinetics for further investigation in the context of 3D chromatin organization . First , we designed experiments to quantify gene expression noise from the observed cell - to - cell variation , which consists of three components , technical noise of the scRNA - seq method , extrinsic noise from various types of heterogeneity among the cell popu - lation , and intrinsic noise mainly from transcriptional bursting ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S6a ) . By using LAST - seq instead of previous scRNA - seq assays , we lowered the level of technical noise . By isolating individual cells from a single - cell clonal expansion popula - tion sharing the same genetic and epigenetic profile , and flow - sorting single G1 - phase human cells gated for a narrow range of cell size and DNA content ( Fig . 3b ) , we mini - mized the extrinsic noise within a homogenous cell population in terms of genetic / epigenetic background , cell size , and the cell cycle stage . Consequently , the remaining cell - to - cell variation experimentally observed was primarily due to the intrinsic noise ( Fig . 3c ) , driven mainly by transcriptional bursting dynamics with only a minor contri - bution from RNA degradation kinetics [ 33 ] . Next , based on the two - state model of transcriptional bursting ( Fig . 3d ) , we used the Poisson - Beta distribution curve fitting to derive the bursting parameters [ 33 ] of indi - vidual genes from the corresponding intrinsic noise profile ( Fig . 3e ) . We filtered out genes deviating from the curve fitting ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S6g ) , reasoning such genes Page 7 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 either have a high level of technical noise , or have transcription dynamics that cannot be approximated by the two - state model [ 34 , 35 ] , thus unsuitable for downstream study of bursting kinetics . Moreover , since the bursting activities of two alleles are often inde - pendent and unsynchronized [ 36 ] , a haploid human cell line ( eHAP ) [ 37 ] was used in this study to avoid the need of separating allelic transcripts . Finally , we characterized the transcriptional bursting parameters in human cells , including burst frequency and burst size ( Fig . 3f ) . In addition to the expected K off > K on Fig . 3 Characterization of transcriptional bursting kinetics in human cells by LAST - seq . a Technical noise plotted by the distribution of coefficient of variation ( CV ) of each mRNA species from 10 samples ( LAST - seq ) or 16 samples ( SMART - seq ) . b Workflow of single - cell transcriptome analyses by LAST - seq to minimize the extrinsic noise . c Gene expression noise profile of haploid human cells .

The statistical test of ( a ) and ( i ) was performed by two - sided Kolmogorov – Smirnov test ( * * p ≤ 0 . 01 , * * * * p ≤ 0 . 0001 ) Page 8 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 for most genes ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S6b ) , we observed a strong negative correlation between expression noise and burst frequency ( Fig . 3g ) , but not burst size ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S6c - e ) . We also found a positive correlation between expression level and burst size ( Fig . 3h ) , but not burst frequency ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S6f ) , for highly expressed genes . Oppositely , the expression level of lowly expressed genes was more correlated to burst frequency rather than burst size ( Fig . 3h and Additional file 1 : Fig . S6f ) . Moreover , we analyzed bursting parameters for genes located in A and B compart - ments , which are physically separated in the 3D chromatin organization of human cells [ 38 ] . We found that genes located in the A compartment showed a slightly higher overall burst frequency , but not a larger burst size , compared to genes located in the relatively inactive B compartment ( Fig . 3i ) , in agreement with a higher expression noise in more repressed chromatin previously observed by single - molecule FISH in a few genes [ 39 ] . Role of topologically associating domains ( TADs ) in burst frequency modulation and temporal coordination of transcription activities Hi - C analysis of human 3D chromatin organization showed the widespread exist - ence of topologically associating domains ( TADs ) as self - interacting genomic regions [ 38 ] . Despite their evolutionary conservation across species and cell types that indi - cates a functional relevance [ 40 , 41 ] , the function of TADs remains to be fully defined [ 40 , 42 – 48 ] . Although no major changes in gene expression level were observed upon genome - wide TAD disruption and rearrangement [ 43 – 46 ] , some specific TADs have been demonstrated to regulate gene expression [ 40 , 47 , 48 ] . Here , we hypothesized that , instead of regulating gene expression level , TADs might modulate transcriptional burst frequency and thus influence gene expression noise and cell - to - cell variation upon cell fate determination [ 49 ] . This hypothesis was based on the strengthened and more fre - quent enhancer - promoter interactions ( EPI ) between elements within the same TADs [ 50 ] and the observation that enhancers mostly modulate burst frequency instead of burst size [ 33 , 51 , 52 ] . To test this hypothesis , we analyzed transcriptome - wide burst frequencies derived from our LAST - seq data . Since the TAD - related EPI is just one factor among many other TAD - independent factors affecting gene expression [ 53 ] and burst frequency [ 54 ] , the burst frequency of individual genes will not demonstrate a striking TAD relevance . Consequently , burst frequencies of many genes must be analyzed together to reveal the potential role of TADs with enough statistical power . Indeed , for genes located within the same TADs ( Fig . 4a ) , we calculated their variability in burst frequencies ( Fig . 4b ) and found a smaller burst frequency variation than the control group of randomly picked genes ( Fig . 4c ) . The smaller burst frequency variation cannot be explained by in cis prox - imity of the genes located within the same TADs , since genes located across the same TAD boundaries , which are also proximal in cis , showed a much larger burst frequency variation ( Fig . 4c ) . To further confirm the TAD dependence of the observed difference in burst frequency variations , we knocked out the cohesin loader complex subunit SCC4 ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S7a ) , globally weakening and disrupting TADs in the still viable human haploid cells [ 55 ] ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S7b ) . Similar to reports in other cell types [ 44 , 45 ] , ~ 10 % of the genes showed significant changes ( > twofold ) in the expression level upon cohesin loss and TAD disruption ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S7c ) . As predicted by our Page 9 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 hypothesis , TAD disruption eliminated the burst frequency variation difference between genes located within the same TADs and genes across TAD boundaries ( Fig . 4d ) . We did not use the degron system to disrupt TADs , since EPIs were found to be insensitive to such acute short - term depletion of cohesin or CTCF [ 56 ] . We then asked whether TADs , in addition to modulating the burst frequency , also temporally coordinate the transcription activities of genes located within them . We measured the temporal correlation of transcription activities between a pair of genes by calculating the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient ( SCC ) between the gene pair’s mRNA transcript level in single cells , with a positive SCC suggesting a positive temporal correlation ( Fig . 4e ) . From the single - cell transcriptome data generated by LAST - seq , we Fig . 4 Role of TADs in burst frequency modulation and temporal correlation of transcription activities . a Schematic showing genes located within TADs and across TAD boundaries . b Burst frequency variations in groups of genes .

This could be due to a lack of temporal coordination between multiple EPIs within the same TADs or between the EPI formation and the transcription activity of the corresponding gene [ 50 , 57 , 58 ] . Interestingly , we observed a TAD - dependent shift of the SCC distribution toward positive values for gene pairs located across the same TAD boundaries ( Fig . 4f , g ) , indicating some mechanism temporally coordinate the transcription of genes across the same TAD boundaries ( Fig . 4h ) . Finally , we propose a model that TADs may have a role in modulating transcriptional burst frequency , likely via TAD - enhanced EPIs , leading to a smaller burst frequency var - iation for genes located within the same TADs ( Fig . 4h ) . Discussion Here , we developed LAST - seq as a new scRNA - seq method with its unique chemistry bypassing the inefficient RT / SSS prior to RNA amplification . Thanks to the direct lin - ear amplification of the original ssRNA molecules in single cells , LAST - seq offers a high single - molecule RNA capture efficiency and a low level of technical noise for single - cell transcriptome analyses . LAST - seq’s superior capture efficiency benefits the study of gene expression noise and transcriptional bursting , enables the detection of minor RNA level differences between individual cells , and elevates the overall quality of single - cell transcriptome data . In addition , direct amplification of the original ssRNA molecules without prior RT / SSS provides an alternative for applications other than scRNA - seq , such as in situ RNA sequencing or low - quality RNA library preparation and sequencing , where the result may be improved by avoiding the inefficient RT / SSS on crosslinked or damaged RNA . We evaluated the performance of LAST - seq against two representative scRNA - seq methods , SMART - seq as the most widely used method , and CEL - seq as another highly sensitive method based on linear amplification . For SMART - seq , we used its most advanced commercially available kit ( SMART - seqV4 ) optimized from the chemis - try of SMART - seq2 [ 5 ] . For CEL - seq , we used its most updated protocol of CEL - seq2 [ 7 ] . Recent development led to a new version of SMART - seq incorporating UMIs for the digital counting of RNA copies , SMART - seq3 [ 8 ] , as well as its miniaturization to achieve a high cellular throughput , SMART - seq3xpress [ 20 ] and FLASH - seq [ 19 ] , that are not widely available at the moment . We estimate the reagent cost per cell for scRNA - seq to be similar between LAST - seq , SMART - seq , and CEL - seq , when performed in tubes or wells . In terms of the cellular throughput , the current version of LAST - seq is limited by the manual pipetting capabil - ity on 96 - well or 384 - well plates . We anticipate LAST - seq to be further optimized and miniaturized in microfluidic droplets , improving its performance while enhancing its cellular throughput , similar to the scaling - up efforts already made for RT / SSS - depend - ent scRNA - seq methods , such as the 10X Chromium instrument based on the chemis - try of SMART - seq2 but with UMI attachment , the Drop - Seq technology [ 11 ] based on SMART - seq2 , and the inDrop sequencing [ 10 ] based on CEL - seq . Page 11 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 In this study , LAST - seq was applied to profile the transcriptome of single human cells , followed by the estimation of transcriptional burst parameters of individual genes . Although a common practice , using the two - state model of transcriptional bursting to derive burst parameters from single - cell data is a simplification [ 59 ] and could lead to inaccuracies . Furthermore , when studying the role of TADs in modulating burst fre - quency for genes located with the same TADs , only those TADs containing enough number of genes with reliably estimated burst parameters were included in our analy - sis . As a result , the conclusion may not be generally applicable to all the TADs iden - tified in the human genome , especially the ones containing few expressed genes were excluded . Future single - cell studies are needed to further elucidate the role of TADs in regulating transcriptional bursting and to investigate the observed temporal correlation of transcription activities for genes located across the same TAD boundaries . Single - cell RNA - seq with a reduced level of technical noise offered by LAST - seq , combined with a high cellular throughput , will be a useful approach to address these questions . Conclusions LAST - seq is a new scRNA - seq method offering a high single - molecule RNA capture efficiency and detection sensitivity . Instead of performing RT / SSS before RNA amplifi - cation , LAST - seq directly and linearly amplifies the original ssRNA molecules in single cells without prior conversion to double - stranded DNA templates . Utilizing its reduced level of technical noise , we applied LAST - seq to study gene expression noise and tran - scriptional bursting in human cells , revealing a role of TADs in the regulation of tran - scriptional bursting and the temporal coordination between transcription activities .

The resulting Cas9 / gRNA complex was then electroporated into 0 . 5 million eHAP cells by the SE Cell Line 4D - NucleofectorTM X Kit L ( Lonza ) using the built - in EN - 138 program . After a 48 - h incubation , successful SCC4 knockout ( KO ) was detected by the genome - editing Page 12 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 detection kit ( IDT ) . Single haploid human cells were then flow - sorted based on cell size into 96 - well plates and cultured for 10 days for single - cell clonal expansion . PCR geno - typing was then performed using half of the cells from each clonal population , with veri - fied SCC4 KO clones further cultured in 6 - well plates , before the final validation of the successful KO by Western blot . PCR genotyping Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 10 μl QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solu - tion ( Lucigen ) . The cell lysate was then incubated at 65 °C for 10 min , 98 °C for 5 min , followed by PCR using Q5 High - Fidelity Master Mix and 0 . 5 μM corresponding primers ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) . The PCR products were analyzed by 10 % DNA polyacryla - mide gel electrophoresis . Western blot Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 30 μl RIPA buffer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) con - taining protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The cell lysate was then mixed with 10 μl Laemmli Sample Buffer ( Bio - Rad ) for a 5 - min 95°C incubation , followed by 10 % SDS - PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting analysis . Anti - Scc4 antibody ( Abcam , ab183033 ) and anti - beta actin antibody ( Abcam , ab8227 ) were used as primary antibodies , and Goat Anti - Rabbit IgG H & L ( Abcam , ab6721 ) was used as the secondary antibody . Preparing single‑stranded RNA templates for T7 IVT To make short ssRNA templates for T7 IVT , 50 μM each of sense strands and anti - sense strands ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) were mixed in equal molar number in the anneal - ing buffer ( 20 mM Tris - Ac pH 8 . 3 , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 ) , incubated at 95°C for 3 min , and slow cooled down to 25°C . To make long ssRNA templates for IVT , dsDNA templates containing a T7 and T3 promoter with a 30 - nt poly - T element were cloned from the PUC18 ( template for T1 . 2K ) and LD220 ( template for T2 . 2K ) , respec - tively ( Addgene ) . RNAs were then generated by IVT of the dsDNA templates , followed by DNase I treatment and RNA column purification ( NEB ) , and finally annealed to the linear primer ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) by a 5 - min 70°C denaturation step and imme - diate cool - down on ice . After the RNA column purification , the annealed products were converted to the final long ssRNA templates for T7 IVT , by a 1 - h 37°C incubation with RNase H and Klenow Fragment exo − in the presence of dNTP and RNase Inhibitor , fol - lowed by column purification . To make transcriptomic ssRNA templates for IVT , total RNA extracted from the HEK293T cells was annealed to the linear primer and converted to the final ssRNA templates , following the same procedure used for the preparation of long ssRNA templates for T7 IVT . IVT of single‑stranded RNA templates To perform IVT on ssRNA templates , 10 ng ssRNA templates were mixed with 20 μl IVT solution ( 1X RNA Pol Reaction Buffer , 2 . 5 mM NTPs , 5 U / μl T7 RNA polymer - ase , 1 U / μl RNase Inhibitor , 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 ) for incubation at 37°C for up to 16 h . IVT products were RNA column purified , DNase I treated , and resolved by 10 % urea Page 13 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 PAGE or 1 . 5 % agarose denaturing gel electrophoresis , or quantified by RT - qPCR using corresponding primers ( Additional file 2 : Table S2 ) and the Verso 1 - step RT - qPCR Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) on the QuantStudio 5 Real - Time PCR System ( Applied Bio - systems ) with the Delta - Delta Ct method . The assembled IVT reaction without any incubation was used as the negative control . Total RNA and genomic DNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from HEK293T cells using the Total RNA Miniprep Kit ( NEB ) with an on - column DNase digestion step . Genomic DNA was extracted from HEK293T cells using the genomic DNA purification Kit ( NEB ) . The total RNA and genomic DNA were Nanodrop quantified . RNA integrity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer . Synthesis and digital quantification of the A60 RNA spike‑in species Specific regions of 24 ERCC spike - ins with a T7 promoter attachment were synthesized ( IDT ) and amplified using a forward primer annealing to the T7 promoter and a reverse primer containing 60 Ts ( Additional file 2 : Table S4 ) . The resulting dsDNA templates were subject to T7 IVT , and the transcribed RNAs were quantified using the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit ( Invitrogen ) and the Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico Kit ( Agilent ) . The 24 RNA spike - in species were then diluted and mixed into the A60 RNA spike - in mix ( Additional file 2 : Table S5 ) . For digital quantification , the A60 RNA spike - in mix was converted to cDNA by oligo - dT 60 primed reverse transcription and quantified by the QX200 Droplet Digital ( ddPCR ) system using the QX200 EvaGreen Supermix ( Bio - Rad ) , Droplet Gen - eration Oil ( Bio - Rad ) , and the corresponding primers ( Additional file 2 : Table S4 ) . The copy number of each A60 RNA spike - in species is reported in Additional file 2 : Table S5 . Single‑cell isolation Single - cell suspensions of HEK293T cells and eHAP human haploid cells were made by trypsin dissociation . HEK293T cells were stained by the Zombie Green dye ( BioLeg - end ) to exclude dead cells . The eHAP cells were stained by both 10 μg / ml Hoechst33342 ( Invitrogen ) and the Zombie Green dye at 37 °C for 15 min to label live haploid and G1 - phase cells . Single cells were then flow - sorted into 96 - well plates with 2 μl lysis buffer in each well , using the BD FACSAria Fusion . LAST‑seq assay Cellular barcode design The 6 - nt cellular barcodes were designed using the DNABarcodes R package [ 61 ] allow - ing a minimal hamming distance of 3 . Barcodes that anneal to the T7 promoter sequence were also eliminated . 80 cellular barcodes were selected ( Additional file 2 : Table S3 ) . Preparing the LAST‑seq primer The LAST - seq primer was made by the ligation between a hairpin module and an rU - dT module . The hairpin module consists of a looping region , a T7 promoter , a PCR han - dle , and the UMI and cellular barcode ( CB ) region . The rU - dT module consists of a complementary linker and an rU - dT tail with a 3 ′ - end dideoxycytidine ( ddC ) blocker Page 14 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S3a ) . Following a heating and cooling program for the hairpin module to form a loop itself , the hairpin module was annealed and ligated with the rU - dT module at 16°C for 30 min in a 20 μl E . coli DNA ligase reaction ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S3b ) . The ligation product was then purified by 10 % urea polyacrylamide gel elec - trophoresis ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S3c ) . Specifically , a small piece of polyacrylamide gel containing the ligation product was soaked in 400 μl 300 μM NaOAc , incubated on dry ice for 15 min and at room temperature for 4 h with a rotator , and ethanol precipitated . Finally , the purified LAST - seq primer was quantified by Nanodrop . Single‑cell lysis Single cells were flow - sorted into 96 - well plates with 2 μl lysis buffer in each well , con - taining 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 nM LAST - seq primer , 0 . 1 U / μl RNase Inhibitor , 0 . 5 mM dNTP , 60 pg RNA carriers , and the RNA spike - in ( 1 μl 1 : 1000 , 000 diluted ERCC spike - in or 1 : 20 , 000 diluted A60 spike - in ) . The plate was then sealed with aluminum film ( Milli - poreSigma ) , briefly spun down , and lysed at 65°C for 5 min before placing on ice . Linear amplification of the single‑stranded RNA molecules by T7 IVT The single - cell lysate was evaporated at 30°C for 25 min by Eppendorf Vacufuge , resus - pended in 10 μl ( for 10 cells pooling ) or 2 . 5 μl ( for 80 cells pooling ) buffer containing 1X NEBuffer2 , 0 . 3 mM dNTP , 1 U / μl RNase Inhibitor , 0 . 02 U / μl RNase H , and 0 . 3 U / μl Klenow Fragment exo − , incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then kept on ice . Single - cell lysates from 10 or 80 cells were then pooled into one DNA LoBind tube and purified by 0 . 5X beads ( Aline Bioscience , C - 1005 – 5 / 50 ) and 1 . 3X buffer . Next , the beads were rehy - drated in 25 μl T7 IVT buffer containing T7 RNAPol Reaction Buffer , 1 . 25 mM NTP , 1 U / μl RNase Inhibitor , 5 mM DTT , 5 mM MgCl 2 and 2 . 5 U / μl T7 RNA Polymerase . After incubation overnight at 37°C for up to 16 h , the aRNA products were purified using 0 . 8X beads and 1X buffer , with final elution using 7 μl of nuclease - free water . Library preparation of the amplified products Six microliters of aRNA products were mixed with 0 . 5 μl 10 mM dNTP and 0 . 5 μl 25 mM random primers , heated at 70°C for 2 min and cooled on ice , assembled into a reverse transcription reaction containing 2 μl 5X first - strand synthesis buffer , 0 . 25 μl 20 U / μl RNase Inhibitor , 0 . 25 μl 0 . 4 M DTT and 0 . 5 μl 200 U / μl SuperScript IV ( Inv - itrogen ) , and incubated at 23°C for 10 min , 50°C for 15 min , 80°C for 10 min . The RT products were PCR amplified for 8 cycles by the Q5 High - Fidelity Master Mix and P5 / P7 primers , followed by 0 . 9X beads purification ( Aline Bioscience ) . The purification prod - ucts were further PCR amplified , beads purified , and eluted in 11 μl 0 . 1 × TE to get the final library for Illumina sequencing ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S8 ) . SMART‑seq Single - cell mRNAs were amplified by the SMART - seqV4 ultra - low input RNA kit ( Takara ) according to the user manual . Briefly , the single - cell or single - cell lysate was distributed into individual PCR tubes containing 5 μl PBS . The lysis buffer containing spike - ins was added to the tube , followed by heating and cooling for single - cell lysis . mRNAs were converted into cDNA by the SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase and were Page 15 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 amplified by 17 cycles of PCR . Libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA library prep kit . Calculation of the detection rate LAST - seq and SMART - seq were applied to single - cell lysate containing 1 μl ERCC ( 1 : 1 , 000 , 000 ) spike - in . For each spike - in species , we determined whether it was detected or not for each well . The ratio of “detected wells” to “total wells” was calculated as the detection rate . The sliding window strategy ( zoo v . 1 . 8 . 9 [ 62 ] ; window size = 9 ; step = 1 ) was used to smoothen the data by taking a sliding mean of the detection rates . CEL‑seq CEL - seq libraries were generated in accordance with the CEL - seq2 protocol [ 7 ] . Briefly , 10 single cells or cell lysates were distributed into 10 PCR tubes containing 1 . 2 μl lysis buffer with 0 . 5 μl 1 : 500 , 000 diluted ERCC spike - in or 1 : 10 , 000 diluted A60 spike - in . PCR tubes were heated at 65 °C for 5 min and quickly cooled on ice to lyse cells and anneal to the poly - A tail . After reverse transcription and second - strand synthesis , the cDNA from the 10 cells was pooled , bead purified , and in vitro transcribed for 13 h . The IVT prod - ucts were then fragmented by heating and converted to cDNA by reverse transcription , followed by 15 cycles of PCR amplification and 2 rounds of bead purification . Genomic DNA contamination Total RNA and genomic DNA were extracted from HEK293T cells . LAST - seq and CEL - seq were performed on 100 pg total RNA and 60 pg genomic DNA , following the proto - cols above . For LAST - seq , 13 cycles of PCR were used to amplify the final libraries from total RNA and genomic DNA . All libraries were quantified by Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit ( Invitrogen ) . The library yield was presented in Additional file 2 : Table S1 . Calculation of minimum free energy The cDNA sequences of selected genes were downloaded from the Ensembl database by BioMart . ViennaRNA [ 63 ] and customized scripts were used to calculate and extract the minimum free energy , respectively . Sequencing Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 instrument with a High Out - put v2 . 5 reagent kit ( Illumina ) . For LAST - seq and SMART - seqV4 libraries , read1 was sequenced for 50 bases , and read2 was sequenced for 25 bases . For CEL - seq libraries , read1 was sequenced for 25 bases , and read2 was sequenced for 50 bases . Sequencing data processing The sequencing data was converted to fastq format by bcl2fastq v2 . 20 , followed by reads trimming using cutadapt v 1 . 15 [ 64 ] with parameters ‘ – nextseq - trim = 20 - m 22 : 14’ . The zUMIs v . 2 . 9 . 7 [ 65 ] pipeline was used for alignment ( GRCh38 . p13 / annotationv33 and ERCC spike - in reference ) , subsampling , and reads / UMI counting . Reads with more than one base below Phred 20 base call scores in the UMI sequence were discarded . UMIs were collapsed by sequence identity . Reads were subsampled to an equal depth for data Page 16 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 of LAST - seq , SMART - seq , and CEL - seq . Reads mapped to exons were used for down - stream analysis . Modeling the technical noise of LAST‑seq Given the single - molecule capture efficiency of LAST - seq , the quantification of mRNA level ( X ) observes the binomial distribution ( B ) as follows : where n denotes the original mRNA level , and p denotes capture efficiency of a single mRNA molecule . The coefficient of variation ( CV ) represents the technical noise which was computed as follows : where np equals the observed expression level on average . We assumed p = 0 . 35 as the capture efficiency to generate the plot . Transcriptional bursting kinetics Single haploid human cells ( eHAP ) were sequenced to an average depth of ~ 4 . 6 M reads per cell . Empty wells ( exon reads < 50 , 000 ) and wells with potential contamination ( exon mapping rate < 50 % ) were eliminated . One hundred forty - eight WT and 153 SCC4 KO eHAP cells were used for downstream analysis . After the batch effect removal by Com - Bat - seq [ 66 ] , an established script [ 33 ] ( https : / / github . com / sandb erg - lab / txbur st ) was used to infer the parameters of transcriptional bursting kinetics from the single - cell RNA - seq data . Specifically , the two - state model of transcriptional bursting was used to simulate the theoretical distribution of the mRNA copy number in individual cells for each gene . After reaching the steady state between transcriptional bursting and mRNA degradation , the theoretical distribution of the mRNA copy number for each gene in single cells , captured at a time snapshot by the scRNA - seq assay , will observe a Poisson - Beta distribution . The parameters of the Poisson - Beta distribution will reflect transcrip - tional bursting parameters including K on , K off , and K syn . As a result , bursting parameters could be derived by fitting the mRNA copy number distribution of each gene observed by single - cell RNA - seq into the theoretical Poisson - Beta distribution , using the maxi - mum likelihood inference to generate the best estimates of transcriptional bursting parameters K on , K off , and K syn for each gene . Since all the parameters were estimated in the unit of a constant mRNA degradation rate , the final burst frequency ( K on ) is still in the unit of the mRNA degradation rate while the final burst size ( K syn / K on ) is not . Since the variability in the mRNA degradation rates of individual genes does not con - tribute much to the estimated bursting parameters [ 33 ] , a universal mRNA degradation rate constant was used in our estimation . The estimated bursting parameters are already relatively stable when use the single - cell transcriptome data from a random half of the sequenced cells , suggesting enough statistical power to estimate bursting parameters given the cell numbers used in our study . Finally , transcriptional bursting parameters were estimated for 5156 genes in the WT haploid human cells and 4435 genes in the SCC4 KO haploid human cells ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S6g ) . X ∼ B ( n , p ) CV = ( 1 − p ) / np Page 17 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 Hi‑C data analysis The processed haploid human cell Hi - C contact matrix and A / B compartment data were downloaded from the 4D Nucleome Data Portal , contributed by Erez Lieberman Aiden Lab [ 67 ] . TADs were called by HiCExplorer3 . 7 . 2 [ 68 ] at 100 K bin size resolu - tion . The TAD boundary was defined as the 5 % region of the two neighboring TADs spanning across the boundary . The A / B compartment data was converted to the bedgraph format by bigWigToBedGraph from UCSC . Gene coordinates were com - pared to the location of TADs , TAD boundaries , and A / B compartments by BEDOPS v2 . 4 . 40 [ 69 ] . Genes completely covered by those 3D genomic features were used for downstream analysis . To compare the Hi - C matrix between the WT cells and SCC4 KO cells , data from Benjamin D . Rowland lab [ 55 ] was visualized by JuiceBox [ 70 ] . Comparison of expression levels To evaluate the transcriptomic changes after SCC4 knockout , the R package BASiCS [ 71 ] was used to identify genes with differential expression level . Genes with < 0 . 1 mean expression level were excluded . A 5 % expected FDR was used for the statistical test . Coefficient of variation ( CV ) of burst frequency To compare the burst frequency variation of genes in the context of TADs , we calcu - lated the CV of burst frequency for groups of genes located within the same TAD or across the same TAD boundary . The CV was calculated by : where σ denotes the standard deviation , and µ denotes the mean . In WT eHAP1 cells , CVs were computed in 59 TADs , each containing at least 8 genes , and 37 TAD boundaries , each containing at least 4 genes . In SCC4 KO cells , CVs were computed in 37 TADs and 32 TAD boundaries , under the same criterion of gene number . For the control of randomly picked genes across the transcriptome , we computed the CV for a random group of genes , with the group size equal to the median gene number in the selected TADs ( 10 genes ) or TAD boundaries ( 5 genes ) . Finally , to compare the CVs of burst frequency for genes located within TADs , across TAD boundaries , and randomly picked control , in both WT and SCC4 KO cells , we performed 10 , 000 bootstraps and plotted the distribution of the median value of the CVs for comparison . Calculation of the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between gene pairs Genes with extremely low expression levels ( < 2 transcripts per cell on average ) were excluded . The transcript level of each gene was normalized by the total number of UMIs for each individual cell , in order to normalize the global cell - to - cell variation due to the residue extrinsic noise . Correlation coefficients between the mRNA tran - script levels of gene pairs were calculated , for all gene pairs located in TADs and TAD boundaries containing at least a pair of genes . For the control , correlation coefficients CV = σ µ Page 18 of 21 Lyu and Chen Genome Biology ( 2023 ) 24 : 184 were calculated between the mRNA levels of gene pairs randomly selected from the transcriptome . In WT eHAP1 cells , correlation coefficients were computed between 16712871 , 6711 , and 987 gene pairs , for the control , for genes in 551 TADs , and for genes across 249 TAD boundaries , respectively . In SCC4KO cells , correlation coef - ficients were computed between 17508403 , 7297 , and 1064 gene pairs , for the control , for genes in 560 TADs , and for genes across 250 TAD boundaries , respectively .
