However , molecular mechanisms by which Dyn2 regulates RTK - induced cell migration have not been established . Recently we reported that SHP - 2 and PI3K mediate PDGFR α - promoted glioma tumor growth and invasion . Here , we show that Dyn2 is an effector downstream of the PDGFR α - PI3K / SHP - 2 signaling in glioma cells . Depletion of endogenous Dyn2 by shRNAs inhibited PDGFR α - stimulated phosphorylation of Akt , Erk1 / 2 , Rac1 and Cdc42 activities , glioma cell migration and survival in vitro , tumor growth and invasion in the brains of mice . Dyn2 binds to SHP - 2 , PI3K and co - localizes with PDGFR α at the invasive fronts in PDGF - A - stimulated glioma cells .

Furthermore , a dominant negative SHP - 2 C459S mutant inhibited PDGF - A - stimulated glioma cell migration , phosphorylation of Dyn2 and concomitantly blocked PDGFR α - induced Src activation . Inhibition of Src by Src inhibitors attenuated PDGF - A - stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and Dyn2 and glioma cell migration . Additionally , mutations of binding sites to PI3K , SHP - 2 or Src of PDGFR α impaired PDGFR α - stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and Dyn2 , and Dyn2 association with activated PDGFR α . Taken together , this study identifies Dyn2 as an effector that mediates PDGFR α - SHP - 2 - induced glioma tumor growth and invasion , suggesting that targeting the PDGFR α - SHP - 2 - Dyn2 pathway may be beneficial to patients with malignant glioblastomas . Keywords Dyn2 ; PDGFR α ; SHP - 2 ; Src ; glioma tumor growth ; invasion Introduction Glioblastoma multiformes ( GBMs ) are the most common and malignant tumors in the central nervous system ( CNS ) ( Jemal et al . , 2010 ) . The inherent single cell invasive nature of GBMs contributes to resistance to therapy and high frequency of tumor recurrence of these tumors after maximal surgical resection , combined with radiotherapy and concurrent or adjuvant chemotherapies . The median survival time of patients with GBMs remains 14 – 16 months after diagnosis ( Furnari et al . , 2007 ; Wen and Kesari , 2008 ) . Thus , understanding the mechanisms underlying the intrinsic tumor infiltration is urgent to improve efficacy of treatments for highly invasive GBMs ( Giese et al . , 2003 ) . Recently , coordinated genomic analyses of a large cohort of clinical GBM specimens showed that the gene encoding platelet - derived growth factor receptor α ( PDGFR α ) was amplified in ~ 13 % of the total GBMs analyzed , ranking PDGFR α at third among the top 11 amplified genes in GBMs ( TCGA , 2008 ) . In clinic , overexpression of PDGFR α is associated with a poor prognosis and shorter survival time for patients ( Furnari et al . , 2007 ; Haberler et al . , 2006 ; Wen and Kesari , 2008 ) . Although activation of PDGFR α - specific pathway involves tumor progression of malignant GBMs , molecular mechanisms by which PDGFR α promotes GBM growth and invasion remain largely unknown ( Calzolari and Malatesta , 2010 ) . The superfamily of dynamin ( Dyn ) includes classical Dyns and Dyn - related proteins that play important roles in endocytosis ( Damke et al . , 1994 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ) , cell migration and invasion ( Kruchten and McNiven , 2006 ) and cancer cell proliferation ( Joshi et al . , 2010 ) . There are three different Dyn isoforms in mammalian : Dyn1 is restricted to express in neuronal cells ; Dyn2 is ubiquitously expressed ; and Dyn3 may be limited to brain , lung and testis ( Kruchten and McNiven , 2006 ) . Abundant evidence implicates Dyns as movers during cell migration and invasion ( Kruchten and McNiven , 2006 ; McNiven et al . , 2000a ) . For example , Dyn2 interacts with components of cytoskeleton , thereby influencing the movement of intracellular vesicles ( Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ; Orth and McNiven , 2003 ) , modulating cell shape ( McNiven et al . , 2000b ) , and affecting podosomal adhesions ( Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ; Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , invadopodia ( Baldassarre et al . , Feng et al . Page 2 Oncogene . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 24 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t 2003 ) , and phagocytosis ( Gold et al . , 1999 ) . Upon PDGF stimulation , Dyn becomes markedly associated with membrane ruffles and lamellipodia , leading to increased cell migration ( Cao et al . , 1998 ; Krueger et al . , 2003 ; McNiven et al . , 2000b ) . Moreover , a dominant - negative ( DN ) Dyn2 K44A mutant blocks PDGF - induced macropinocytosis ( Schlunck et al . , 2004 ) . However , although this evidence suggests that Dyn is involved in PDGF - stimulated cell migration and other studies show that Dyn interacts with PI3K and phospholipase C γ - 1 ( PLC γ - 1 ) that are common downstream modulators for receptor tyrosine kinases , including PDGFR α ( Scaife et al . , 1994 ) , how Dyn mediates PDGFR α - promoted cell migration is still elusive . SHP - 2 is a non - receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) that has been implicated in the activation of the Ras - MAPK signaling by receptors for various growth factors and cytokines , including PDGFR α signaling ( Matozaki et al . , 2009 ; Neel et al . , 2003 ) . Moreover , activating SHP - 2 mutations were observed in hematological malignancies and other types of cancers including two E69K and I292M mutations in GBMs and a T22A mutation in oligodendrogliomas ( Navis et al . , 2010 ) . Most recently , PTPN11 ( encoding SHP - 2 protein ) was identified as a “Linker” gene for connections to various altered genes in GBMs by genomic analysis ( Cerami et al . , 2010 ) . Our recent report functionally validated this hypothesis demonstrating that SHP - 2 mediates PDGFR α - promoted tumorigenesis and tumor invasion in mouse Ink4a / Arf null astrocytes and human glioma cells ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . In this study , we investigated mechanisms of PDGFR α - SHP - 2 stimulation of glioma cell growth and invasion . We show that Dyn2 is a downstream effector of the PDGFR α - PI3K / SHP - 2 signaling . Mechanistically , Dyn2 regulates PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell growth and invasion through interaction with activated PDGFR α , SHP - 2 and PI3K as well as Src - dependent protein phosphorylation . Results Depletion of Dyn2 inhibits PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell migration in vitro To determine the role of Dyn2 in PDGFR α - regulated glioma cell growth and invasion , we first examined the expression of Dyn isoforms in various glioma cell lines , mouse fibroblasts ( NIH3T3 ) and astrocytes ( mAst ) . As shown in Figure 1A , Dyn1 is expressed at low levels in all cell lines examined . Dyn3 is highly expressed in LN428 , U138 , LN443 , T98G , LN235 and NIH3T3 cells but at low levels in other cell lines . In contrast , Dyn2 was found at high levels in all cell lines analyzed . To determine the function of Dyn2 , we chose SNB19 and LN444 cells with high levels of Dyn2 . We first knocked down Dyn2 using lentivirus - encoded shRNAs in LN444 and SNB19 glioma cells that were stimulated with PDGF - A { PDGF - A only activates PDGFR α , ( Tallquist and Kazlauskas , 2004 ) } . As shown in Figure 1B and Figure S1 , knockdown of Dyn2 in these glioma cells by two separate shRNAs but not a control shRNA reduced PDGF - A - induced phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1 / 2 as well as GTP - loading of Rac1 and Cdc42 , two critical small GTPases that mediate Dyn - modulated cell motility ( Kruchten and McNiven , 2006 ) without affecting the expression and tyrosine phosphorylation ( p - Y ) of PDGFR α . While PDGF - A stimulated cell migration of LN444 and SNB19 cells ( Figure 1C and Figure S2 , Supplemental movies 1 and 2 ) , knockdown of Dyn2 markedly inhibited PDGF - A - stimulated cell migration of both cell Feng et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t lines ( Figure 1C and Figure S2 ) . Interestingly , depletion of Dyn2 by shRNAs did not affect FBS - , EGF - , and HGF - stimulated glioma cell migration ( Figure S3 ) , suggesting that Dyn2 is important and specific for PDGFR α - promoted glioma cell migration . Knockdown of Dyn2 suppresses PDGFR α - stimulated glioma tumor growth and invasion in vivo To determine the function of Dyn2 in PDGFR α - promoted glioma tumorigenesis , we knocked down Dyn2 in LN444 / PDGF - A cells by two different lentivirus - encoded shRNAs ( # 1 and # 2 ) and a control shRNA . As shown in Figure 2A , ~ 70 % of endogenous Dyn2 in puromycin - resistant cell populations was reduced in LN444 / PDGFA / shRNA cells when compared to the control shRNA cells . In vitro , depletion of Dyn2 in LN444 / PDGF - A cells had a minimal impact on cell proliferation when compared to that of LN444 / GFP or control shRNA cells ( Figure 2B ) . However , knockdown of Dyn2 markedly attenuated PDGF - A / PDGFR α - stimulated cell survival ( Figure 2C ) and migration ( data not shown ) . Additionally , treatment of LN444 / PDGF - A / shDyn2 cells with AG1296 , an inhibitor for PDGFR has no effect on PDGF - A - stimulated cell proliferation ( Figure 2B ) and survival ( Figure 2C ) and migration ( not shown ) , suggesting that Dyn2 is not at upstream of PDGFR in glioma cells . These data suggest that under these experimental conditions , inhibition of Dyn2 by shRNA knockdown only affects PDGF - A - promoted glioma cell survival but not cell growth in vitro . Next , we examined determine the function of Dyn2 in PDGFR α - promoted glioma tumorigenesis in vivo . In the brains of mice , LN444 / PDGF - A glioma cells formed highly tumorigenic and invasive gliomas whereas LN444 / GFP cells only established small and non - invasive tumors ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , we separately implanted LN444 / PDGFA / control - shRNA ( shControl ) and LN444 / PDGF - A / Dyn2 - shRNA ( shRNA # 1 and shRNA # 2 ) cells into the brains of mice . As shown in Figure 2D , compared with control LN444 / PDGF - A gliomas ( Figure 2D , panels a and d ) , knockdown of Dyn2 in LN444 / PDGF - A tumors markedly suppressed PDGFR α - stimulated glioma growth and invasion in the brains of mice ( Figure 2D , panels b , c , e , f , Figure 2E and 2F ) . When various brain sections with different tumors were examined by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) staining , LN444 / PDGF - A / shRNA - Dyn2 tumors showed a significantly decrease in cell proliferation compared to LN444 / PDGF - A / shControl tumors ( Figure 2D , compare panel g with h and i ; Figure 2G ) . Similarly , when compared to LN444 / PDGF - A / control shRNA tumors , LN444 / PDGF - A / shRNA # 1 and # 2 tumors displayed a marked increase in cell apoptosis ( Figure 2D , compare panel j with k and l , Figure 2H ) . Taken together , these results suggest that Dyn2 is important for PDGFR α - promoted glioma cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo . Dyn2 mediates PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell migration through PI3K and SHP - 2 Dynamin was previously shown to interact with PI3K in PC12 cells stimulated by PDGF ( Scaife et al . , 1994 ) . Since PI3K and SHP - 2 mediate PDGFR α - stimulated glioma tumor growth and invasion in the brains of mice ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) and Dyn interacts with PI3K ( Scaife et al . , 1994 ) , we hypothesized that Dyn2 mediates PDGFR α - SHP - 2 - stimulated glioma cell migration . To test this hypothesis , we first transiently transfected wild - type ( WT ) HA - Dyn2 , dominant - negative ( DN ) HA - Dyn2 - K44A mutant or a vector control into SNB19 and LN444 glioma cells , respectively . After validating the expression of exogenous Feng et al . Page 4 Oncogene . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 24 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Dyn2 by immunoblotting ( IB , Figure S4A ) , we determined the impact on glioma cell migration by in vitro cell migration assays . As shown in Figure S4B , compared with the control SNB19 or LN444 cells , overexpression of WT Dyn2 did not significantly affect PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell migration . However , expression of a DN Dyn2 - K44A mutant significantly attenuated PDGF - A - stimulated cell migration of both cell lines . Thus , these data suggest that Dyn2 is important for PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell migration . Next , we determined whether Dyn2 interacts with SHP - 2 and PI3K in SNB19 and LN444 cells stimulated by PDGF - A . As expected , PI3K was associated with Dyn2 in PDGF - A - treated glioma cells . Interestingly , Dyn2 also binds to SHP - 2 in PDGF - A - stimulated glioma cells ( Figure 3A ) , suggesting an involvement of Dyn2 in PDGFR α - SHP - 2 - stimulated glioma cell migration . To examine this possibility , we treated SNB19 / WT HA - Dyn2 and SNB19 / Control cells with inhibitors of PI3K ( LY294002 ) or SHP - 2 ( PHPS - 1 or NSC87877 ) with or without PDGF - A stimulation . As shown in Figure 3B , inhibition of PI3K or SHP - 2 by their inhibitors effectively abrogated PDGF - A - stimulated glioma cell migration whereas overexpression of a WT HA - Dyn2 by SNB19 glioma cells did not fully but partially rescued the inhibitory effects by these inhibitors on PDGF - A - stimulated cell migration , suggesting Dyn2 as an effector downstream of the PDGFR α - PI3K / SHP - 2 signaling . To further study this signaling , we examined the subcellular distribution of PDGF - A - stimulated Dyn2 , cortactin ( a Dyn2 - binding protein that involves in PDGF - stimulated actin - remodeling ) ( Krueger et al . , 2003 ) and PDGFR α in serum - starved SNB19 cells that were transiently transfected with a WT Dyn2 - GFP and pre - treated with or without LY294002 , followed by PDGF - A stimulation . As shown in Figure 3C , consistently with previous reports ( Krueger et al . , 2003 ; McNiven et al . , 2000b ) , Dyn2 and cortactin distributed along the cell cortex and internal membrane compartments in non - PDGF - stimulated cells ( Figure 3C , panel a and Figure S5 , panels a to c ) . After PDGF - A stimulation , both proteins were redistributed and co - localized at the invasion fronts of cells ( Figure 3C , panel b and Figure S5 , panels d to f ) . Similarly , in non - stimulated cells , PDGFR α was distributed on internal membrane compartments ( Figure 3C , panel d and Figure S5 , panels j to l ) ; PDGF - A stimulation induced PDGFR α redistribution and co - localization with Dyn2 at the invasion fronts of cells ( Figure 3C , panel e and Figure S5 , panels m to o ) . However , PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked their redistribution and co - localization at the invasion fronts of cells ( Figure 3C , panels c and f and Figure S5 , panels g to I and p to r ) . Taken together , these data show that activation of PDGFR α induces the association of Dyn2 with PI3K and SHP - 2 , and co - localization of PDGFR α , Dyn2 and cortactin , thereby augmenting PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell migration . SHP - 2 mediates interaction of Dyn2 with activated PDGFR α Next , we assessed whether inhibition of SHP - 2 affects the association between Dyn2 and PDGF - A - activated PDGFR α by knockdown of endogenous SHP - 2 with a SHP - 2 siRNA . As shown in Figure 4A , siRNA depletion of SHP - 2 significantly decreased association of Dyn2 with activated PDGFR α compared with the control in PDGF - A - stimulated SNB19 and LN444 cells . Furthermore , impairment of association of Dyn2 with PDGFR α by knockdown of SHP - 2 also markedly inhibited PDGF - A - stimulated Rac1 and Cdc42 activities ( Figure 4A , lower panels ) and glioma cell migration ( Figure 4B ) . Thus , these data suggest that Feng et al . Page 5 Oncogene . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 24 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t SHP - 2 mediates Dyn2 binding to activate PDGFR α , thereby promoting Rac1 and Cdc42 activities and glioma cell migration . PRD domain of Dyn2 is necessary for its association with SHP - 2 It has been demonstrated that Dyn2 interacts with various Src homology ( SH ) - domain - containing endocytic adaptor proteins through its proline - rich domain ( PRD ) ( Gout et al . , 1993 ; Kruchten and McNiven , 2006 ) . To determine whether the PRD domain of Dyn2 is required for its association with SHP - 2 , we transiently transfected SNB19 cells with WT HA - Dyn2 , a Dyn2 mutant lacking its PRD domain ( HA - ΔPRD ) or a vector control . As shown in Figure 6A , PDGF - A stimulation of SNB19 cells induced the association of WT Dyn2 with SHP - 2 and GTP - loading activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 whereas the Dyn2 ΔPRD mutant failed to bind to SHP - 2 and also inhibited PDGF - A - stimulated Rac1 and Cdc42 activities in SNB19 cells ( Figure 5A ) . Next , we assessed the impact of loss of the association between Dyn2 and SHP - 2 on PDGFRa - stimulated cell migration . As shown in Figure 5B , expression of WT Dyn2 did not significantly affect PDGF - A - induced cell migration whereas introduction of the ΔPRD mutant markedly impaired the PDGF - A - stimulated cell migration . Taken together , these data indicate that Dyn2 induces PDGFR α - SHP - 2 - promoted glioma cell migration through interaction with SHP - 2 via its PRD domain . PDGFR α - SHP - 2 induces glioma cell migration through Src - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Dyn2 SHP - 2 is a ubiquitously expressed non - transmembrane PTP and essential in RTK signaling pathways ( Chan et al . , 2008 ; Matozaki et al . , 2009 ) . Thus far , we demonstrated that the interaction of SHP - 2 and Dyn2 is required for PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell migration . To assess whether activity of SHP - 2 is required for Dyn2 function , we expressed a Myc - His tagged DN C459S SHP - 2 ( catalytically - inactive ) mutant in SNB19 cells . As expected , the C459S SHP - 2 mutant decreased PDGFR α - induced p - Akt ( Figure 6A ) and PDGFRa - promoted cell migration ( Figure 6B ) . However , SHP - 2 C459S mutant retained its ability to associate with PDGFR α induced by PDGF - A ( Figure 6A ) . Next , since tyrosine phosphorylation ( p - Y ) of Dyn2 is critical for its function ( Cao et al . , 2010 ; Weller et al . , 2010 ) , we examined the impact of loss of SHP - 2 activity on the induced p - Y of Dyn2 . As shown in Figure 6C , expression of a DN C459S SHP - 2 mutant , but not a WT SHP - 2 markedly inhibited PDGF - A - induced p - Y of Dyn2 . Furthermore , expression of C459S SHP - 2 , but not WT SHP - 2 , inhibited PDGF - A - stimulated p - Src Y418 ( Figure 6D ) , consistent with a previous observation that SHP - 2 regulates Src activity by affecting p - Y of Src Y418 ( Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , since the DN C459S SHP - 2 mutant inhibited p - Y of Dyn2 and p - Src Y418 , it is possible that PDGF - A activated Src - induced p - Y of Dyn2 , leading to increased cell migration . To test this hypothesis , we treated PDGF - A - stimulated SNB19 cells with two separate Src family kinase ( SFK ) inhibitors , PP2 and SU6656 , and found that the inhibition of SFK activity significantly reduced PDGF - A stimulation of p - Y of Dyn2 ( Figure 6E ) and cell migration in vitro ( Figure 6F ) . Lastly , we investigated the roles of SHP - 2 in recruiting Dyn2 to activated PDGFR α and Src in induction of p - Y of Dyn2 using mouse Ink4a / Arf null astrocytes that separately express PDGFR α WT and its various mutants ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . As shown in Figure 6G and Figure Feng et al . Page 6 Oncogene . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 24 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t S6 , expression of WT PDGFR α enhanced p - Y of Dyn2 , its association with PDGFR α and phosphorylation of Akt ( p - Akt S473 ) upon PDGF - A stimulation . In contrast , consistent with our recent report ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) , mutations of PDGFR α at the SHP - 2 ( F720 ) , the Src ( F572 / 74 ) or the PI3K ( F731 / 42 ) binding sites did not significantly affect the overall p - Y of PDGFR α but reduced PDGF - A - induced p - Akt S473 . Furthermore , loss of capacities of interacting with these signal modules decreased PDGF - A - induced p - Y of Dyn2 and association with PDGFR α in these cells ( Figure 6G and Figure S6 ) . The residual PDGF - A - induced p - Akt S473 , p - Y of Dyn2 and Dyn2 association to activated PDGFR α in these mouse astrocytes were due to PDGF - A stimulation of endogenous PDGFR α in the astrocytes since these cells are not PDGFR α - deficient ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . Taken together , these data suggest that SHP - 2 activity is required for PDGFR α stimulation of p - Akt , p - Y of Dyn2 , the association between Dyn2 and PDGFR α , and glioma cell migration , and that Src - dependent p - Y of Dyn2 mediates PDGFR α - induced glioma cell migration . Discussion In this report , as illustrated in a working model ( Figure 7 ) , we demonstrated a mechanism by which Dyn2 regulates PDGFR α - SHP - 2 / PI3K - stimulated glioma tumor growth and invasion . By using an established in vivo glioma model that activation of the PDGFR α - SHP - 2 / PI3K signaling promotes glioma growth and invasion in the brain ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) , we identified Dyn2 as a downstream effector for PDGFR α - induced glioma cell migration and survival in vitro , and tumor growth and invasion in vivo . Dyn2 mediates PDGFR α stimulation of glioma cell migration through association with SHP - 2 and PI3K via its PRD domain , association and co - localization with the activated PDGFR α and activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 . Inhibition of SHP - 2 by siRNA knockdown , a DN SHP - 2 mutant , SHP - 2 inhibitors , deletion of the PRD domain of Dyn2 or a mutation of the SHP - 2 binding site of PDGFR α suppressed PDGFR α - Dyn2 - stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1 / 2 , Rac1 and Cdc42 activities , and glioma cell growth and migration , thereby establishing a link of SHP - 2 and Dyn2 with PDGFR α activation . Furthermore , we show that SHP - 2 activity is required for Src - dependent p - Y of Dyn2 , which is critical for PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell migration . One of the important aspects of this work is the identification of Dyn2 as a downstream modulator for PDGFR α - SHP - 2 - stimulated glioma tumor growth and invasion . Dyn has been implicated in PDGF - stimulated cell migration through changing its own cytoplasmic distribution in fibroblasts ( McNiven et al . , 2000b ) . Disruption of Dyn2 function altered Rac localization and inhibited Rac - dependent cell spreading and lamellipodia formation in PDGF - induced macropinocytosis in fibroblasts even though Rac was activated ( Schlunck et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , Dyn is also recently implicated in the promotion of cancer cell proliferation ( Joshi et al . , 2010 ) . Small - molecule inhibitors of Dyn { myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromides ( MiTMAB ) } competitively impaired the ability of Dyn to bind phospholipids and abrogated receptor - mediated endocytosis . Cells treated with Dyn inhibitors ( MiTMAB and octadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ) prevented the growth of a wide range of human cancer cells but had much less effects on non - tumorigenic fibroblast cells ( Joshi et al . , 2010 ) . Our results are consistent with these studies . We show that Dyn2 is essential for PDGFR α - SHP - 2 - stimulated Akt , Erk1 / 2 , Rac1 and Cdc42 activities , and glioma tumor growth and invasion . Depletion of Dyn2 by shRNAs inhibited these Feng et al . Page 7 Oncogene . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 24 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t PDGFR α - stimulated signaling , glioma cell migration and survival in vitro , and tumor growth and invasion in the brains of mice . Overexpression of WT Dyn2 did not significantly affect PDGF - A - induced cell migration whereas a DN Dyn2 - K44A mutant or a Dyn2 δ PRD mutant incapable of associating with SHP - 2 impaired the PDGFR α stimulation . Taken together , these results establish a link between Dyn2 and activation of the PDGFR α - SHP - 2 signaling , leading to an enhanced glioma tumor growth and invasion . The second important finding in this study is that our data reveals a collaborative function of Dyn2 and SHP - 2 to mediate PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell invasion . A previous study showed that poliovirus ( PV ) infection of cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells depends on Dyn - dependent caveolar endocytosis and intracellular virus - triggered the PV receptor ( PVR ) signals through the association of PVR with SHP - 2 ( Coyne et al . , 2007 ) . In breast cancer , prolactin ( PRL ) and insulin - like growth factor I ( IGF - I ) regulate the pathogenesis and progression together via increasing proliferation , survival , and invasion . Src family kinase activity is required for IGF - IR association with SHP - 2 , and knockdown of Dyn2 reduces SHP - 2 association with IGF - IR ( Carver et al . , 2010 ) . Our results in this study suggest that Dyn2 mediates PDGFR α - SHP - 2 - stimulated glioma cell growth and invasion through interaction with SHP - 2 upon PDGFR α stimulation . Moreover , inhibition of SHP - 2 by siRNA depletion , SHP - 2 inhibitors , disruption of SHP - 2 binding to Dyn2 or mutation of SHP - 2 binding site of PDGFR α ( F720 ) abrogated Dyn2 binding to activated PDGFR α , and PDGF - A - stimulated cellular signaling and glioma cell migration , demonstrating that Dyn2 mediates the PDGFR α - SHP - 2 signaling in promoting glioma cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo . The last novel finding in this study is that SHP - 2 - mediated Dyn2 phosphorylation via Src is essential for PDGFR α - stimulated glioma cell migration . Src plays an important role in regulating the endocytosis of PDGFR β - G protein coupled receptor complexes , in which Src induces p - Y of Grb - 2 associated binder - 1 ( Gab1 ) and promotes accumulation of Dyn2 at the plasma membrane ( Waters et al . , 2005 ) . Src is recently found to activate Dyn2 by phosphorylation to induce Golgi fragmentation ( Weller et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , Src - dependent p - Y of Dyn2 and its associated actin - binding protein , cortactin regulate clathrin - mediated endocytosis of transferrin in epithelial cells ( Cao et al . , 2010 ) . Additionally , SHP - 2 activates Src kinase by inhibiting the recruitment of C - terminal Src kinase , which exerts its inhibitory role by phosphorylating of Src Y529 ( Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , during angiogenesis , VEGF - A - mediated VEGFR - 2 activation is down - regulated by collagen I but not vitronectin . SHP - 2 is recruited to the activated VEGFR - 2 , and then promotes p - Y of Dyn2 via Src to mediate VEGFR - 2 internalization ( Mitola et al . , 2006 ) . Consistent with these reports , our data not only validates that Src - dependent p - Y of Dyn2 induced by PDGFR α activation is critical for glioma cell migration , but also demonstrates that SHP - 2 activity is required for Src - dependent p - Y of Dyn2 , underscoring the link between Dyn2 and SHP - 2 with PDGFR α - Src activation in promoting glioma cell migration . However , although we show that Src induces p - Y of Dyn2 and Src inhibitors exert an opposite effect , we cannot rule out the involvement of other members of the SFK family or other non - receptor tyrosine kinases in this process . This possibility is illustrated by a study that cortactin , a partner of Dyn , can stimulate cell motility ( Kowalski et al . , 2005 ) , and is phosphorylated by SFKs as Feng et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t well as Abl and Arg ( Boyle et al . , 2007 ; Wu and J . T . , 1991 ) . In addition , Dyn2 also binds to Grb2 , Dock4 ( a Rac1 guanine exchange factor ) and PDGFR β , forming a ternary complex to regulate PDGF - dependent cell migration on fibroblasts ( Kawada et al . , 2009 ) . These alternative possibilities of how Dyn2 is involved in the PDGFR α - SHP - 2 signaling in promoting glioma cell invasion warrant further investigation . In summary , this study provides novel insights into the mechanisms by which Dyn2 mediates the PDGFR α - SHP - 2 / PI3K signaling through a SHP - 2 - induced and Src - dependent p - Y of Dyn2 in glioma cells . Our data identified Dyn2 as an effector downstream of the PDGFR α - SHP - 2 signaling , critical in promoting glioma cell migration in vitro and tumor growth and invasion in vivo . Since Dyn2 is essential for various cell biological functions including cell motility and proliferation , our study suggests that targeting the PDGFR α - SHP - 2 - Dyn2 signaling may be beneficial for treatments of patients with glioblastomas and other types of human cancers that overexpress PDGFR α . Materials and Methods In vitro cell migration assays In vitro cell migration assays were performed as we previously described ( Imanishi et al . , 2007 ) . Briefly , 5 × 10 5 cells / ml in 50 μl of DMEM plus 0 . 5 % FBS were separately placed into the top wells of a Boyden chamber . The bottom wells contained 50 ng / ml PDGF - A or EGF , 40 ng / ml HGF , 10 % FBS , or vehicle with or without indicated inhibitors . The cells were allowed to migrate through an 8 - μm pore size membrane pre - coated with fibronectin ( 10 μg / ml ) for 8 – 10 h at 37°C . Afterwards , the membrane was fixed and stained , non - migrating cells were removed and the remaining cells were counted . Six high - power fields ( total magnification , X200 ) from each sample were randomly selected . Data were normalized to the stimulated control ( 100 % ) and analyzed using the GraphPad Software . Living cell fluorescence real - time imaging SNB19 cells expressing a nuclear - located H2A - GFP protein were seeded onto 35 mm No . 1 . 5 coverslip bottom dishes . After 24 h serum starvation , the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without 50 ng / ml PDGF - A plus 0 . 5 % FBS and incubated at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 coupled to a spinning disk UltraVIEW RS confocal imaging system ( Perkin Elmer , Boston , MA ) . Cells were imaged at 10 min intervals , using a 300 ms exposure time during the 12 h time course . Images were compiled into a QuicktimeTM movie using the software Velocity ( Improvision , Coventry , UK ) . Cell proliferation and apoptosis MTT assay— Various cells were seeded onto 96 - well plates at a density of 4 , 000 per well , 6 replicates per cell line . After overnight incubation , the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM plus 0 . 5 % FBS containing 2 μM AG1296 or vehicle . At indicated times , 50 μl MTT ( 2 mg / ml in PBS ) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 4 h . MTT reduction by viable cells was measured colorimetrically at 570 nm using a Microplate Reader . Feng et al . Page 9 Oncogene . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 24 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t TUNEL assay— Various cells were plated on 8 - well chamber slides . After overnight incubation , the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM plus 0 . 5 % FBS with 2 μM AG1296 or vehicle . After 48 h , slides were fixed by 4 % formaldehyde in ice - cold PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 solution . After equilibration , slides were immersed in TUNEL reaction buffer at 37°C for 60 min inside the humidified chamber . Reaction was stopped by 2× saline sodium citrate ( SSC ) and slides were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 and mounted . One thousand cells of each slide were randomly examined and numbers of TUNEL - positive cells were counted under a microscope equipped with a SPOT digital camera . Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopic analyses SNB19 cells transiently transfected with Dyn2 - GFP were plated on glass coverslips in media with 10 % FBS . After overnight , the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 0 . 5 % FBS . The cells were cultured for an additional 24 h , pre - treated with 10 μM PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 , for 1 h , and then stimulated with 50 ng / ml PDGF - A for 5 min . After the treatment , coverslips were washed and fixed by 4 % formaldehyde in ice - cold PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 solution . After equilibration , slides were stained with anti - cortactin ( 1 : 300 ) and anti - PDGFR α ( 1 : 50 ) antibodies in AquaBlock reagent in PBS at 4°C overnight , and then re - stained with secondary antibodies . Coverslips were mounted and examined under an Olympus Fluoview 1000 Confocal equipped with a digital camera . Statistical analyses One - way ANOVA or an unpaired , two - tailed Student ' s t test followed by Newman - Keuls post - test was performed using the GraphPad Prism software . A p value of 0 . 05 or less was considered statistically significant . Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material .

A working model for the PDGFR α - PI3K / SHP2 - Dyn2 signaling in glioma cells . PDGF - A activation of PDGFR α induces Dyn2 association with PI3K and SHP - 2 and activates SHP - 2 and Src , leading to Src - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Dyn2 . Activation of Dyn2 stimulates its downstream effectors including Akt , Erk1 / 2 , Rac1 and Cdc42 , resulting in increased glioma growth and invasion . Feng et al . Page 21 Oncogene .
