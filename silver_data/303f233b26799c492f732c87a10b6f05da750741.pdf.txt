Published online 4 November 2002 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nsb865 Pseudomonas aeruginosa galactose - and fucose - binding lectins ( PA - IL and PA - IIL ) contribute to the virulence of this pathogenic bacterium , which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients . The crystal structure of PA - IIL in complex with fucose reveals a tetrameric struc - ture . Each monomer displays a nine - stranded , antiparallel (cid:2) - sandwich arrangement and contains two close calcium cations that mediate the binding of fucose in a recognition mode unique among carbohydrate – protein interactions . Experimental binding studies , together with theoretical docking of fucose - containing oligosaccharides , are consis - tent with the assumption that antigens of the Lewis a ( Le a ) series may be the preferred ligands of this lectin . Precise knowledge of the lectin - binding site should allow a better design of new antibacterial - adhesion prophylactics . Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can infect almost every human tissue when immunity barriers are lowered . Chronic lung colonization by the bacterium is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients 1 . CF is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) , which acts as a chloride channel 2 . The mutations , which alter ion movements , also affect the N - glycosylation of CFTR , as well as that of other cell surface glycoconjugates . The net effect is increased fucosylation , decreased sialylation 3 and specific bind - ing to P . aeruginosa 4 . In addition , CF patients display modifica - tions in their respiratory and salivary mucin with a higher percentage of sialylated and sulfated Lewis x ( Le x ) oligosaccha - rides 5 , which are binding sites for P . aeruginosa via fimbrial and flagellar adhesins or non - pili lectins 6 . The identification of mole - cules involved in this pathogen - specific recognition of the mod - ified host cell components is therefore of therapeutic value . P . aeruginosa produces high levels of D - galactose and L - fucose binding lectins , PA - IL and PA - IIL 7 , in association with its cyto - toxic virulence factors 8 and under quorum sensing control 9 . The lectin genes have been identified 10 and the sugar affinities have been characterized , revealing an outstandingly high affinity of PA - IIL for fucose 11 . Here we report the high - resolution crystal structure of PA - IIL in complex with fucose , together with bind - ing data and modelling studies . Structure of PA - IIL – fucose complex To characterize carbohydrate recognition by PA - IIL , we crystallized PA - IIL in the presence of fucose . The crystal structure was determined using the single - wavelength anomalous diffrac - tion ( SAD ) technique with a crystal soaked in holmium - containing solution . The PA - IIL crys - tals contain a tetramer of four independent sub - units , each of them containing two Ca 2 + ions and each binding a fucose ligand ( Fig . 1 ) . The overall fold of PA - IIL is that of a nine - stranded anti - parallel β - sandwich . In each subunit , strands 1 – 5 form a greek - key structural motif , extended by strands 6 – 8 , which associate with strands 1 and 4 to form a 5 - stranded curved β - sheet . Topology and structure similarity searches identified signif - icant similarities to the C2 domain , a protein module that binds Ca 2 + ions and phospholipids 12 . The N - terminal region of the protein forms a β - strand that inserts between strands 5 and 6 . We refer to this strand as strand 0 .

Dimerization is the result of a head - to - tail associa - tion between two monomers that make contact through the curved five - stranded β - sheet . Dimerization largely involves hydrophobic contacts between strands outside of the greek - key motif — that is , strands 6 , 7 and 8 — and several hydrogen bonds at the extremity of these strands . The resulting buried sur - face is ∼ 1 , 500 Å 2 per monomer . The most striking feature is the involvement of the C - terminal carboxyl group ( Gly 114 ) of each monomer in the ligand - binding site of the other monomer . Tetramerization occurs mainly by the antiparallel association of β - strands comprising amino acids 79 – 85 ( strand 6 , Fig . 1 ) from each dimer with their counterparts in the other dimer . The sur - face buried by this association is limited ( ∼ 500 Å 2 per monomer ) . The calcium - and sugar - binding site The calcium - binding pocket consists of two calcium - binding loops ( CBL - 1 connecting strands 1 and 2 and CBL - 2 connecting strands 7 and 8 ) and the C - terminus of the adja - cent monomer . The calcium - binding site con - tains six acidic groups , five of which are involved in calcium binding . Both calcium ions have a classical seven ligand coordination but there is a distinct asymmetry in ligand distrib - ution : the site 1 calcium receives five carboxylate and two ligand oxygen atoms , whereas the site 2 calcium receives three carboxylate , two car - bonyl and two ligand oxygen atoms . Loop CBL - 1 only participates in cal - cium binding via the Asn 21 main chain oxygen , whereas the side chains of Glu 95 , Asp 99 , Asp 101 , Asn 103 and Asp 104 of loop CBL - 2 are all involved , with a special role for both Asp 101 and Asp 104 in bridging the two calcium ions . The average dis - tance between the two calcium ions is relatively small , 3 . 75 Å , possibly resulting from overcompensation of the positive charges by the numerous acidic groups . The fucose locks onto both calcium ions , a binding mode that is unique among protein – carbohydrate interactions ( Fig . 2 ) . Three of the fucose hydroxyl groups participate in the coordina - tion of calcium ions : O2 to calcium site 1 , O4 to site 2 and O3 to both sites . In addition to directly coordinating the Ca 2 + ions , the same three hydroxyl groups also hydrogen bond to acidic groups in the calcium - binding site . In addition to these interactions with CBL - 1 , the fucose ring oxygen receives one hydrogen bond from the main chain nitrogen of Ser 23 in CBL - 2 . The fucose methyl group at position 6 creates hydrophobic interactions with both the Ser 23 hydroxymethyl and Thr 45 methyl groups . No contact is observed between the fucose anomeric oxygen O1 and the protein . The electron density map ( Fig . 2 c ) is in agree - ment with anomeric disorder at this position ( ∼ 80 % of α - and 20 % of β - fucose ) . The first crystal structure of a fucose - binding lectin , Anguilla anguilla agglutinin ( AAA ) , has been reported recently 13 .

Nevertheless , there are major differences between AAA and PA - IIL : AAA is a trimer , its ligand binding is not mediated by calcium and the topology of its β - sheets is different from that of PA - IIL . In contrast with most lectins that display only weak affinity for monovalent sugar ligands , the PA - IIL – fucose interaction has an association constant in the micromolar range 11 . The unusual interactions formed by the two Ca 2 + ions , the amino acid side chains that coordinate the Ca 2 + ions and the sugar provide the basis for such strong affinity . The ligand requirement for binding to two such adjacent calcium ions is the particular stereo - chemical arrangement of three carbohydrate hydroxyl groups . L - fucose in its usual 1 C 4 chair conformation is characterized by vicinal equatorial O2 and O3 groups , together with an axial O4 group . Other monosaccharides displaying the same sequence of one axial and two equatorial hydroxyl groups are L - galactose , D - mannose and D - arabinose , all of which are recognized by PA - IIL , although with differing affinities 11 . Comparison with other calcium - containing lectins indicates that PA - IIL displays a unique monosaccharide - binding mecha - nism . Most C - type animal lectins , such as in the original mannose - binding protein structure 14 , contain two Ca 2 + ions 15 , but the distance between the two ions is larger ( ∼ 8 Å ) than that observed here and only one cation is involved in sugar binding , with a correspondingly low association constant . Serum amyloid P component ( SAP ) , a pentraxin , contains two close calcium ions that have been demonstrated to bind to carbohydrates , although only to some sugar derivatives carrying negative charges 16 . Oligosaccharide recognition Cystic fibrosis mucins and cell surface glycoconjugates that serve as targets for PA - IIL carry fucose as the terminal residue on com - plex oligosaccharide antigens of the Lewis a ( Le a ) or Le x series 3 . The ability of various sugars to competively inhibit the binding of PA - IIL to a human blood group H and Le b active glycoprotein ( Table 1 ) demonstrates that the Le a active pentasaccharide ( lacto - N - fucopentaose ) is the most potent one , with 30 × , 38 × and 120 × higher activity than Le x trisaccharide , sialyl - Le x and D - mannose , respectively , whereas D - galactose was inactive . Replacement of the Le x bulky GlcNAc group by glucose improved its binding . Docking of Le a trisaccharide to PA - IIL was performed without any steric conflict and energy minimization , suggesting further stabilization of the complex by two additional hydrogen bonds between O6 of GlcNAc and Ser 23 and between O6 of Gal and Asp 99 . When Le x was docked , the methyl of the N - acetyl group created a steric conflict with residues 22 – 24 , which geometry optimization relieved at the cost of a small distortion at the α Fuc1 - 3GlcNAc glycosidic linkage . The non - ideal positioning of N - acetyl in the Le x series would explain their generally weaker affinity . In the docking mode proposed here , the addition of either a sulfated group or an additional residue on position 3 of galactose should have little or no effect on the affinity because it does not interact with the protein surface . On the other hand , the presence of a longer oligosaccharide on the reducing side would create additional interactions in the region close to Arg 72 . The present modelling results are consistent with the experimental data described above and are relevant to the find - ing of high levels of sialyl - Le a antigen in sera of patients with CF 17 . The present study explains the stereochemical basis of high affinity fucose recognition by a bacterial lectin via coordination of two calcium ions . Modelling studies in conjunction with binding experiments demonstrate that the preferred ligands of this bacterial lectin belong to the Le a series . A preliminary report , based on one patient case , described an anti - adhesion based therapy of respiratory Pseudomonas infection using a fucose - and galactose - containing solution 18 . Structure - based knowledge might be used for designing efficient anti - bacterial compounds , as was already proposed for Helicobacter pylori 19 and Streptococcus pneumoniae 20 in stomach and ear infections , respectively . Furthermore , the unusual high affinity interaction of this novel binding mode suggests that PA - IIL may be a useful target for oligosaccharide - based therapeutics . Methods Lectin preparation and inhibition by oligosaccharides . PA - IIL was purified by affinity chromatography 7 , with purity confirmed by SDS - PAGE and mass spectrometry 10 . The ability of various sugars to inhibit the binding of PA - IIL was determined by measuring the inhi - bition of biotin - avidin - mediated microtiter plate lectin – glycan binding assays 21 , testing lectin ( 100 ng in 50 µ l ) binding to a human blood group H and Le b active glycoprotein ( cyst Tighe phenol insol - uble gp , 500 ng in 50 µ l ) from ovarian cyst fluid . Crystallization and structure determination . Lyophilized puri - fied PA - IIL was dissolved in water ( 10 mg ml – 1 ) in the presence of fucose ( 250 µ g ml – 1 ) and salts ( ZnCl 2 , CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 at 2 mM ) . Hanging drops were prepared using 2 . 5 µ l of this preparation and 2 . 5 µ l of the reservoir solution , consisting of 1 . 75 M ammonium sul - fate in 0 . 1 M Tris HCl , pH 8 . 5 , and stored at 20 °C . Heavy atom deriv - atives were prepared by soaking crystals for 3 h in a 10 mM solution of HoCl 3 . All data images were collected from crystals cryo - cooled at 100 K ( after soaking them for as short a time as possible in reservoir solu - tion with 30 % ( v / v ) glycerol ) using ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detectors on ESRF ( European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ) beamlines ID14 - 2 and ID14 - 1 . SAD data to 2 . 3 Å resolution ( ID14 - 1 ) were collected from the HoCl 3 soaked crystal at a wavelength ( 0 . 934 Å ) remote from the holmium absorption edges , and native data were col - lected to 1 . 3 Å resolution ( ID14 - 2 ) . All image data were integrated using the HKL suite 22 and subsequently scaled and converted to structure factors with the CCP4 suite 23 . The crystal structure was determined using the SAD technique with the holmium derivative . Four holmium positions were determined using SOLVE 24 , corre - Table 1 IC 50 values of various saccharides for the inhibition of PA - IIL binding to a human blood group H and Le b active glycoprotein Inhibitor IC 50 ( nM ) 1 Potency 2 Lacto - N - fucopentaose 0 . 05 5 Gal β 1 → 3 [ Fuc α 1 → 4 ] GlcNAc β 1 → 3Gal β 1 → 4Glc Sialyl Lewis a ( SLe a ) 0 . 07 3 . 5 Neu5Ac α 2 → 3Gal β 1 → 3 [ Fuc α 1 → 4 ] GlcNAc Lewis a ( Le a ) 0 . 09 2 . 8 Gal β 1 → 3 [ Fuc α 1 → 4 ] GlcNAc β 3 ′ Fucosyllactose 0 . 18 1 . 4 Gal β 1 → 4 [ Fuc α 1 → 3 ] Glc β L - Fucose 0 . 25 1 Lewis x ( le x ) 1 . 50 0 . 17 Gal β 1 → 4 [ Fuc α 1 → 3 ] GlcNAc β Sialyl Lewis x ( Sle x ) 1 . 90 0 . 13 Neu5Ac α 2 → 3Gal β 1 → 4 [ Fuc α 1 → 3 ] GlcNAc β D - Mannose 6 . 00 0 . 04 1 The inhibitory activity was estimated from inhibition curves . 2 Potency is the reciprocal of the inhibiting concentration relative to fucose ( taken as 1 . 0 ) . © 2002 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r es t r u c t u r a l b i o l og y letters nature structural biology • volume 9 number 12 • december 2002 921 sponding to one holmium per monomer in the asymmetric unit and giving initial phases to 2 . 8 Å resolution with an overall figure of merit of 0 . 42 . Phases were extended to 2 . 3 Å resolution using DM 25 . The resulting map served to construct , using O 26 , an initial poly - alanine model of the tetramer , which was then used to perform four - fold averaging using DM . The new electron density map was used to construct an improved polyalanine model that was then used as a search probe for molec - ular replacement in the higher resolution native structure . Four - fold averaging and phase extension ( using DM 25 ) to 1 . 3 Å resolution , followed by a complete automatic construction and side chain docking with ARP / wARP 27 , resulted in a model of 444 out of 456 residues with R cryst of 17 . 8 % and R free of 21 . 2 % . The remainder of the residues , calcium ions and fucose molecules were positioned manually using O 26 . Further refinement cycles , including automatic water molecule placement using ARP / wARP , were performed with REFMAC 28 and manual rebuilding with O resulted in a final model of all 456 residues , 8 calcium ions , 4 fucose molecules and 704 water molecules with R cryst of 13 . 7 % and R free of 15 . 8 % using all data to 1 . 3 Å resolution ( Table 2 ) . Molecular modelling . The starting point for docking studies was the orientation of fucose as observed in the crystal structure of its lectin complex . Because of their branched structures , both Lewis trisaccharides can adopt only one conformation , and this has been well characterized through crystallography , NMR and modelling studies 29 . Energy minimization in the binding site included full opti - mization of the oligosaccharide residues , calcium ions and side chains of adjacent amino acids . Calculations were performed with the TRIPOS force field 30 together with charges and energy parame - ters derived for protein – carbohydrate interaction studies 31 .
