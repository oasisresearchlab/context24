Cell division by cytokinesis completes the cell cycle for every cell . Cytokinesis in fungal , amoeboid and animal cells takes place in four steps ( FIG . 1 ) . The process begins when the cell marks the site of the future cleavage furrow relative to the sister chrom atids , which are separated by the mitotic apparatus . Accurate placement of the cleavage plane is important because the aim of cyto kinesis is to create two cells , each with its own nucleus . At the selected site the cell assembles a contractile ring , which comprises the motor protein myosin II , actin filaments and many other proteins and is attached to the plasma mem­ brane . As in muscle contraction , interactions of myosin II with actin filaments produce force to constrict the contractile ring and to form a cleavage furrow in the plasma membrane . Remarkably , the contractile ring dis assembles as it constricts , so it does not become thicker like contracting muscle does . Finally , proteins that bring together mem­ branes for their fusion promote the reorgan­ ization of the plasma membrane at the base of the furrow and the separation of the two daughter cells . The mechanism of cytokinesis through a contractile ring appeared about one billion years ago in the common ancestor of amoebas , fungi and animals . These organisms share most of the genes used for cytokinesis by the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , so lessons learned about mechanisms in fission yeast should apply to animals . The membrane fusion machinery is older than the contractile ring , as plant cells fuse membrane vesicles to build new plasma membrane between the daughter nuclei rather than constricting a furrow 1 . Little is known about cytokinesis in eukaryotes that branched before algae and plants ( for example , Giardia spp . and trypanosomes ) except that their genomes also lack myosin II , so the mechanism of cyto­ kinesis in these eukaryotes is different from that in amoebas , fungi and animals . Of all the commonly used model organ­ isms , fission yeast offer many advantages for studying cytokinesis , so an active community of investigators is making rapid progress in deciphering the mechanisms of cyto kinesis in fission yeast . Like in animal cells , the position of the mitotic apparatus ( inside the nucleus in fungi ) determines the position of the con­ tractile ring in fission yeast . The fission yeast genome encodes ~ 4 , 940 proteins . Classical and reverse genetics have produced the best inventory of more than 130 cytokinesis genes ( see Supplementary information S1 ( table ) ) and conditional mutations for many of these genes 2 , 3 . TABLE 1 lists the proteins that are rel­ evant to the contractile ring . Deletion strains for 98 % of the ~ 4 , 900 of the total genes are available ( Bioneer ) . The size and shape of the cells are ideal for quantitative microscopy and many cytokinesis proteins have been tagged with fluorescent proteins in the genome . These features made it possible to chart a high­resolution time line of cytokinetic events 4 and to quantitate the intracellular distributions of key cytokinesis proteins 5 . In a field dominated by genetics , biochem­ ical analysis has been limited but is growing . Enough quantitative data are available to formulate and test mathematica l models for some steps in cytokinesis 6 , 7 . This article discusses advances being made through research on fission yeast , with a focus on conserved features that are likely to be used by other cells . Main pathway of cytokinesis The advantages of fission yeast ( discussed above ) made it possible to show that events during cytokinesis occur like clock­ work ( see Supplementary information S2 ( movie ) ) . Events can be followed with a pre­ cision of one or two minutes on an absolute time­scale anchored to time zero , when the spindle pole bodies separate 4 . Spindle pole bodies are the structures that anchor micro­ tubules of the mitotic spindle in fungi . Use of this timescale ( FIG . 2 ) allows for comparisons of observations between laboratories and for detecting subtle problems , such as changes in timing that result from experimental manipulations . The following account sum­ marizes our views regarding contractile ring assembly in fission yeast , but we want the reader to appreciate that questions remain regarding every step in the process . Assembly of interphase nodes . Protein assemblies called nodes are precursors of the contractile ring 8 – 11 . The adaptor anillin­like protein , the product of the mid1 ( also known as dmf1 ) gene in fission yeast , appears in interphase nodes around the equator of interphase cells more than 1 hour before time zero 4 , 10 , along with the kinases Cdr1 , Cdr2 and Wee1 and other proteins ( Blt1 ( also known as SPBC1A4 . 05 ) , kinesin­like opinion Understanding cytokinesis : lessons from fission yeast Thomas D . Pollard and Jian - Qiu Wu Abstract | For decades after the discovery that a contractile ring made of actin filaments and myosin II produces the force to constrict the cleavage furrow of animal cells , the complexity of cytokinesis has slowed progress in understanding the mechanism . Mechanistic insights , however , have been obtained by genetic , biochemical , microscopic and mathematical modelling approaches in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Many features that have been identified in fission yeast are probably shared with animal cells , as both inherited many cytokinesis genes from their common ancestor about one billion years ago . The mechanism of cytokinesis through a contractile ring appeared about one billion years ago in the common ancestor of amoebas , fungi and animals .

Assembly of these interphase nodes depends on the presence of kinase­active Cdr2 , which interacts with mid1 12 , 14 and might be anchored to the cell cortex through its carboxyl terminus 15 . Cdr1 and Cdr2 phosphory late and inhibit Wee1 , a kinase that holds the cell in G2 phase by phosphorylating the master cell cycle kinase cell division control protein 2 ( Cdc2 ; also known as Cdk1 ) , which controls cell cycle progression 13 . The location of nodes during interphase depends on the kinase Pom1 and another unknown inhibitor 6 , 16 – 18 . Pom1 concentrates at both ends of the cell and restricts inter­ phase nodes containing Cdr2 and mid1 to the middle of the cell . As a cell grows longer , the inhibitory activities decline in the middle of the cell , allowing Cdr1 and Cdr2 to phosphorylate and inhibit Wee1 . This releases the kinase Cdc2 to trigger the transition into mitosis , thus coupling growth to the cell cycle 12 , 13 . In addition to the ‘negative regulation’ that excludes interphase nodes from cell tips , the polo kinase Plo1 releases mid1 from the nucleus before mito­ sis 19 and seems to prepare the ~ 65 inter­ phase nodes around the equator of the cell for cytokinesis before the onset of mitosis . The position of the nucleus determines the location of these maturing nodes and , there­ fore , the position of the contractile ring by a mechanism that is still under investigation . Maturation of Mid1 interphase nodes . Starting 10 minutes before spindle pole body separation , nodes containing ~ 25 copies of mid1 mature by sequentially adding , from cytoplasmic pools , ~ 25 molecules of myosin II ( each composed of 2 heavy chains and 4 light chains ) and ~ 25 ring assembly protein 2 ( Rng2 ; a member of the IQGAP family ) molecules , followed by ~ 25 copies of the F­BAR domain­containing protein Cdc15 and ~ 2 dimers of the formin Cdc12 , which makes the node competent for actin assembly 5 . We call these mature nodes cytokinesis nodes . Detecting the formin Cdc12 is difficult 20 , 21 because it is the least abundant known cytokinesis node protein 5 and because it arrives last , so most ( younger ) Figure 1 | Strategies for cytokinesis used by plant , fission yeast and animal cells . Plants , amoebas , fungi and animals all arose from a common ancestor , branching off as shown . In plants , the cell division plane is selected by the nucleus specifying the position of a preprophase band of micro­ tubules around the equator . Plants lack key proteins to make a contractile ring , so they depend on membrane fusion to separate the two daughter cells . Phragmoplast microtubules transport Golgi vesicles to the midplane to form the new plasma membrane . Amoebas divide much like animal cells and are not illustrated . In fission yeast , the cell division plane is selected by the nucleus specifying the position of nodes around the equator , whereas in animals , spindle and astral microtubules specify the position of the con­ tractile ring . Fission yeast and animal cells assemble a contractile ring of actin filaments and myosin II around the equator of the cell between the chromosomes , which are separated by microtubules of the mitotic appara­ tus . the ring constricts and the daughter cells separate by membrane fusion . see also Fig . 2 for more details on the process in fission yeast .

All rights reserved 10 nodes have no detectable Cdc12 ( REF . 4 . ) Some interphase node proteins ( Cdr2 , Blt1 , Klp8 and Gef2 ) remain with mid1 during the formation of the contractile ring , but Cdr2 leaves the ring during anaphase B 12 , 13 . We know little about the assembly , archi­ tecture or attachment of nodes to the cortex in either interphase or mitosis , and they have not been seen by electron microscopy . not much quantitative biochemical data are available on interactions among the large , poorly soluble , multi­domain node proteins . mutation of mid1 in a region called the amphipathic α­helix compromises its asso­ ciation with the cortex 22 , but this element is part of a much larger insoluble domain of unknown architecture . Like other anillins , mid1 has a C­terminal PH domain , but it is not required for association with the cortex 10 . Lateral diffusion of nodes in the plane of the membrane is very slow ( 20 nm 2 s – 1 ) up to time + 2 minutes . Anchoring by actin fila­ ments might constrain their movements , but they do not diffuse faster in the absence of actin filaments 7 . Actin filament assembly at time + 2 minutes . The assembly of actin filaments for the contractile ring depends on the formin Cdc12 20 , 23 , 24 and a profilin — a small protein that can interact with actin monomers and sequences of multiple proline residues found in other proteins 25 . Formins nucleate actin filaments from free actin monomers 26 and cooperate with profilin to elongate the fila­ ment 26 – 29 . Profilin – actin complexes bind to multiple polyproline sequences in the Cdc12 formin homology 1 ( FH1 ) domain 20 , 23 , 26 and transfer rapidly onto the fast growing barbed end of the filament 26 , 28 , 29 , whereas the FH2 domain moves processively on the growing end without dissociating 26 , 28 . Thus , Cdc12 might anchor actin filaments to the cytokinesis nodes . Cdc12 cannot elongate actin filaments using actin fused to green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) 5 , so contractile ring actin filaments can only be labelled indirectly with fluores­ cent phalloidin in fixed cells 30 or with GFP fused to an actin filament­binding domain , such as a calponin homology domain , or Lifeact in live cells 21 , 31 . GFP – calponin homol­ ogy domains decorate transient linear con­ nections between cytokinesis nodes that might be single actin filaments 7 , although this has not yet been verified by other methods . These putative actin filaments grow from cytokinesis nodes in random directions close to the plasma membrane at about 80 subunits per second and contact neighbouring cyto­ kinesis nodes . The endoplasmic reticulum is closely opposed to the plasma membrane and might help to restrict these filaments to the plane close to the plasma membrane . Cdc8 ( also known as tropomyosin ) is an α­helical coiled­coil protein that binds along the actin filament helix and increases the rate of elong­ ation of filaments by Cdc12 but can also dissociate Cdc12 from the barbed end or trap Cdc12 between two annealed filaments 32 . It is not known how cells control the associa­ tion of Cdc12 with nodes or the nucleation activity of Cdc12 . Cytokinesis nodes condense into a contractile ring . As soon as actin filaments appear in the cortex around the equator at time + 2 minutes , cytokinesis nodes start moving at about 30 nm s – 1 in short bursts of ~ 20 seconds . table 1 | identified cytokinesis proteins in fission yeast generic name Schizosaccharomyces pombe name * Cleavage furrow placement proteins GIN4 family kinase cdr2 ser / thr kinase Kin1 Anillin­like protein Mid1 ( Dmf1 ) γ ­tubulin complex subunits Mto1 ( Mbo1 ) and Mto2 Polo kinase Plo1 DYrK kinase Pom1 Contractile ring assembly and maturation proteins capping protein Acp1 and Acp2 Actin Act1 ( cps8 ) cofilin cof1 ( Adf1 ) α ­Actinin Ain1 Aurora B kinase Ark1 ( Aim1 ) Microtubule cross­linking factor Ase1 survivin Bir1 ( cut17 ) Novel protein Blt1 ( sPBc1A4 . 05 ) ‡ Formin cdc12 F­BAr domain containing protein cdc15 Profilin cdc3 Myosin II light chain cdc4 tropomyosin cdc8 cdc14 phosphatase clp1 ( Flp1 ) Fimbrin Fim1 rho GeF Gef2 ‡ Hsp90 chaperone Hsp90 ( swo1 ) Kinesin Klp8 ‡ Myosin II heavy chains Myo2 ( rng5 ) and Myp2 ( Myo3 ) Borealin Nbl1 Phosphoinositide­dependent kinase Pdk1 ( Ppk21 ) Inner centromere protein ( INceNP ) Pic1 GeF for rho1 rgf3 ( Lad1 ) Myosin II regulatory light chain rlc1 IQGAP family protein rng2 Ucs domain­containing protein rng3 Acp , F­actin­capping protein ; Act , actin ; Ain1 , α ­actinin­like protein 1 ; Ase1 , anaphase spindle elongation protein 1 ; cdc , cell division control ; clp1 , cdc14­like phosphatase 1 ; GeF , guanine nucleotide exchange factor ; Hsp , heat shock protein ; Klp8 , kinesin­like protein 8 ; Myo2 , myosin II ; Myp2 , unconventional myosin II ; rlc1 , regulatory light chain 1 ; rng , ring assembly . * Alternative protein names are provided in brackets . ‡ the role needs to be further tested .

Our hypothesis to explain these intermittent movements is that myosin II ( myo2 ) in cytokinesis nodes captures the actin filaments growing from neighbouring nodes . The nodes are then pulled together trans iently until the actin fila­ ment connection is broken by the dissociation of myosin II from the filament , severing of the filament ( probably by the actin filament severing the protein cofilin ) , or by Cdc12 turnover ( FIG . 3 ) . monte Carlo simulations ( a stochastic simulation method based on the probability of each reaction ) of a simple search , capture , pull and release model , with parameters similar to those measured in live cells , reproduce the assembly of the contrac­ tile ring in the correct time of 10 minutes , providing that the mechanism includes frequent breaks in the connections between the cytokinesis nodes 7 . Bundles of actin filaments form natu­ rally during the condensation of cytokinesis nodes into a contractile ring and several groups have proposed that contractile rings form by cross­linking filaments in a ‘lead­ ing cable’ that is nucleated from a single ‘spot’ containing Cdc12 20 , 23 , 33 – 35 . This was a reasonable idea , as Cdc12 is more obvious after actin filaments and nodes form bun­ dles than during the short interval between time zero and the onset of cytokinesis node condensation , when each node contains just a few Cdc12 molecules . Similarly , bundles of actin filaments are much easier to image than the thin connections between dispersed cyto kinesis nodes early in the process . The existence of spots that promote the formation of leading cables depends on the actin filament cross­linking protein α­actinin­like 1 ( Ain1 ) , but normal contractile rings can form without Ain1 or the spot 20 , 21 . Electron micrographs of permeabilized anaphase cells treated with the myosin head domain were interpreted to show that contractile rings consist of two bundles of actin filaments with oppo­ site polarities that originate from a single source 35 . However , some of the filaments in these bundles appear to us to be anti­ parallel , consistent with mechanisms other than the leading cable model , such as the search and capture mechanism . Electron micrographs of filaments early in the assembly pro cess might help to explain the relationship between dispersed networks of cytokinesis nodes connected by short fila­ ments and the bundled filaments in more mature contractile rings . many mechanistic questions remain about contractile ring assembly . We do not know whether formin­dependent polymeri­ zation of actin filaments suffices to explain the onset of cytokinesis node condensation , or whether cells must also regulate the activity of myo2 with the UCS domain­containing protein Rng3 ( REF . 36 ) , phosphoryl ation of myosin II heavy chains 11 , 37 or light chains 37 , 38 , or other mechanisms . Maturation of the contractile ring . Contractile rings do not change in size or shape between time + 11 and + 35 minutes , but many proteins are exchanged with oth­ ers from the cytoplasmic pool 20 , 39 , 40 . During this time the ring acquires other proteins , such as capping protein , the unconventional myosin II ( myp2 ; also known as myo3 ) and the F­BAR domain­containing protein Imp2 , and loses mid1 . Contractile rings can form without input from the septation initiation network ( SIn ) signalling pathway , Figure 2 | Time course of cytokinesis in fission yeast . time zero is defined as the time when the spindle pole bodies separate . starting at time – 60 minutes , interphase nodes containing the anillin­like protein Mid1 ( also known as Dmf1 ) and cell cycle kinases form near the plasma membrane . Negative signals from the ends of the cell position these nodes around the equator . Dynamic microtubules push the nucleus to the centre of the cell . At time – 10 minutes , interphase nodes begin to mature into cytokinesis nodes by the addition of myosin II ( Myo2 ) , ring assembly protein 2 ( rng2 ; a member of the IQGAP family ) , the F­BAr domain­containing protein cell division control protein 15 ( cdc15 ) and the formin cdc12 . Following spindle pole body separation , cdc12 and cdc3 ( also known as profilin ) stimulate the poly­ merization of actin filaments that bind tropomyosin and cross­linking proteins . During anaphase A ( at time + 5 minutes ) , interactions of myosin II with actin filaments condense nodes into a contractile ring , which matures by adding more cdc15 , capping protein , unconventional myosin II ( Myp2 ; also known as Myo3 ) and other proteins . In anaphase B ( at time + 10 to + 30 minutes ) the mitotic spindle elongates and the anillin­like protein Mid2 and septins form double rings adjacent to the contractile ring . Mid1 disappears from the ring at the onset of its constriction . At the end of anaphase , a signalling pathway consisting of a GtPase and three protein kinases ( the septation initiation network ( sIN ) ) triggers con­ striction of the contractile ring ( at time + 40 minutes ) , membrane invagination and synthesis of a new cell wall to form a septum . constriction ends at time + 70 minutes . After another 30 minutes , scission of the plasma membrane separates the cytoplasm and septum remodelling separates the cells .

A network of proteins including the F­BAR domain­ containing proteins Cdc15 and Imp2 , the C2 domain­containing protein Fic1 and paxillin­related protein 1 ( Pxl1 ) also stabi­ lize the ring 40 , 43 , 44 . The number of proteins in the mature ring is known , but how they are organized and how the ring is attached to the plasma membrane are unknown . Adjacent to the contractile ring , the anillin­ like protein mid2 and four GTP­binding proteins called septins polymerize to form two rings that remain after the contractile ring has constricted 4 , 45 – 47 . Contractile ring constriction and disassembly . Starting at time + 35 minutes , the ring con­ stricts circumferentially down to a small spot at about 5 nm s – 1 ( REFs 4 , 39 , 48 ) — a linear rate that is almost 50 times slower than the large contractile rings of sea urchin eggs 49 and nematode embryos 50 , following the trend that constriction rate is proportional to the circumference of the ring 50 . Constriction is presumed to occur by a sliding filament mechanism , similar to that in striated muscles , but the details are unknown . As in sea urchin eggs 51 and nematode embryos 50 , the ring loses actin filaments and actin­binding proteins , by an uncharacterized mechanism , in proportion to the decline in circumference 4 , 5 . The actin filament concentration is therefore constant . In contrast to nematode embryos 50 , fission yeast contractile rings concentrate myosin II as they constrict 4 . The SIn pathway is required for con­ striction and disassembly of the contractile ring , but the mechanisms of these processes are not known owing to limited informa­ tion about the substrates of the SIn pathway proteins 52 , except for the Sid2 kinase . Sid2 phosphorylates Cdc14­like phosphatase 1 ( Clp1 ) , creating a binding site for the 14­3­3 serine phosphate­binding protein Rad24 , which retains Clp1 in the cytoplasm 53 . mid1 anchors Clp1 in the contractile ring 54 , where it dephosphorylates Cdc15 and contributes to the stability of the ring . Backup pathway for ring assembly The ability of fission yeast cells to form con­ tractile rings and divide without mid1 or cytokinesis nodes 4 , 8 , 11 , 42 , 55 – 57 revealed a mech­ anism that corrects defects in the normal assembly pathway 31 , 43 ( see BOX 1 for the dif­ ferent views of geneticists and biophysicists on what it means to be essential ) . During mitosis , cells without mid1 form strands of contractile ring proteins ( including myo2 , actin , Cdc12 and Cdc15 ) scattered over the cortex . These proteins can therefore assemble without mid1 as a scaffold . In some cells , these strands become connected into rings oriented at random angles and positions relative to the long axis of the cell . These oblique rings can slowly constrict the plasma membrane and direct the forma­ tion of a septum , but are usually off­centre , so they do not reliably separate the two daughter nuclei . This backup pathway depends on the SIn pathway 42 and activation of this path­ way in interphase may produce contractile rings by this mechanism 58 . This alternative pathway works better in cells with a temp­ erature sensitive mutation of 1 , 3β glucan synthase component 1 ( Bgs1 ; also known as Cps1 ) , by allowing oblique contractile rings to slide into a normal orientation that is perpendicular to the long axis of the cell 57 , 59 . nothing is known about how the mecha­ nisms of this pathway relate to the normal search , capture , pull and release pathway , or to the normal disappearance of mid1 before constriction . Septation and membrane scission Cells use the SIn pathway to coordinate the formation of a specialized cell wall , called the septum , with ring constriction and fusion and scission of the plasma mem­ brane 41 . Supplementary information S1 ( table ) lists more than 70 genes , includ­ ing septins , an anillin ( mid2 ) , enzymes , GTPases and membrane trafficking machinery , that contribute to septum for­ mation and membrane fusion and scission . The role of Bgs1 in restricting the motion of contractile rings 57 , 59 suggests that the con­ tractile ring might be physically connected to the enzymes that make the septum . Figure 3 | Mechanism of contractile ring assembly in fission yeast . a | the cycle of reactions hypothesized in the search , capture , pull and release mechanism of contractile ring assembly . cytokinesis nodes contain the anillin­like protein Mid1 ( also known as Dmf1 ) , myosin II ( Myo2 ) and the formin cell division control protein 12 ( cdc12 ) . Actin filaments grow in random directions from nodes by adding subunits at rate v pol ( the rate of actin polymerization ) . If a filament approaches a node within distance r , less than a defined distance r c ( capture radius ) , myosin II can capture the filament . Myosin II applies force on attached filaments and moves nodes at velocity v . Actin filament connections between nodes break owing to severing or other reactions , with a time constant of τ break , after which the cycle is repeated . b | An overview of contractile ring assembly and constriction in fission yeast . During interphase , cdc12 is distributed throughout the cell in small clusters called speckles . At time zero minutes , cdc12 joins nodes around the equator and nucleates actin filaments . the actin filaments form bundles as myosin II pulls the cytokinesis nodes into a ring . As the contractile ring constricts , the septum forms between the daughter cells , which separate by membrane fusion .

All rights reserved 10 Major open questions We understand the assembly , constriction and disassembly of contractile rings in fis­ sion yeast better than in any other organism , but our understanding is incomplete and much work is yet to be done . The identifica­ tion of the long list of cytokinesis genes in Supplementary information S1 ( table ) is a remarkable achievement for this small field . One might hope that the list is close to com­ pletion , but it has doubled in 10 years , so some cytokinesis genes are probably yet to be discovered . The less complete inventories of cytokinesis proteins in animals overlap with the proteins used by fission yeast . The participation of anillin , myosin II , actin and formins , as well as the general order of events , indicate that mechanisms of cyto­ kinesis are likely to be similar in fission yeast and animals . more detailed studies on animals will be required to document the extent of these similarities and any funda­ mental differences . Punctate contractile ring precursors containing myosin II and anillin have been seen in animal cells , and conden­ sation of these precursors into a contractile ring depends on the formin cytokinesis defect protein 1 ( CyK­1 ) in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos 60 . more work is required to learn how similar the mechanism is to that in fission yeast . Learning how well the molecular mecha­ nisms of cytokinesis are conserved will depend on better inventories of cytokinesis genes from the main branches of the phylo­ genetic tree and a better understanding of the reactions at the system level . The current state of knowledge suggests that most new cytokinesis genes that appeared during evolution were conserved in sub­ sequent branches of the tree . Actin is the most ancient component , having arisen in the common ancestor of all forms of life . Prokaryotes use actin for many interesting processes , but apparently not for cytokinesis . After algae and plants diverged , primitive amoeboid eukaryotes evolved myosin II and the contractile ring mechanism based on actin filaments . Amoebas , fungi and animals retained this mechanism for reliable cell division . The genes for membrane traffic and scission are more ancient than the genes that encode myosin II and are still used by all higher eukaryotes . Certain aspects of cytokinesis are better understood in systems other than fission yeast . For example , we understand how mitotic spindle microtubules , Rho family GTPases and chromosomal passenger pro­ teins control contractile ring positioning , assembly and constriction better in animals than in fission yeast 61 . numerous exam­ ples show that organisms adapted ancient proteins for novel cytokinesis strategies , illustrating how evolution can stumble upon any number of strategies based on available materials . However , we are more impressed by the conservation of basic mechanisms , so deciphering elements of the system in a favourable organism should provide insights into cytokinesis in other cells . Beyond an account of the participating molecules , understanding the mechanisms will depend on better ideas , more informa­ tion about the participating molecules , high quality quantitative measurements in live cells and mathematical models . Better ideas are needed because some fundamental concepts are missing , such as strategies to assemble contractile ring precursors . Our understanding of the mechanisms of most cytokinesis proteins ( IQGAPs , for example ) is still primitive . Even where characteriza­ tion is advanced , such as for actin , myosin II and formins , gaps remain , such as in under­ standing the mechanisms regulating the activity of Cdc12 . GFP fusion proteins and spectacular new microscopes enable the pre­ cise measurement of cellular events , but this work is in its infancy . mathematical models have been useful for formulating and testing some ideas about cytokinesis , and we expect them to be the indispensable gold standard for designing and interpreting experiments in the future .

Box 1 | on being ‘essential’ What does it mean to say that a gene or protein is ‘essential’ for a complicated process such as cytokinesis ? Geneticists and biophysics use the word essential in different ways . From the genetics perspective , a gene or protein is essential if the viability of the organism depends on it and ‘non - essential’ if the organism can survive without it , even if survival is a struggle . From the biophysics perspective , a gene or protein is essential if the system does not work normally in its absence , showing that the component is required for normal timing and / or fidelity . Some genes such as the anillin - like mid1 ( also known as dmf1 ) are not essential in the sense that strains lacking mid1 are viable . However , cells lacking the Mid1 protein do not grow well and cytokinesis is far from normal , so the protein is absolutely required for the ‘normal’ process of cytokinesis . The fact that some cells lacking Mid1 manage to cleave in two illustrates the important point that cells have mechanisms to correct serious defects that occur along the normal pathway .
