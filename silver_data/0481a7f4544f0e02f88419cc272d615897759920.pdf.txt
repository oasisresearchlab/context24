DCs control the activation of T cells ( TCs ) in the lymph nodes . This process involves forming a specialized superstructure at the DC - TC contact zone called the immunological synapse ( IS ) . For the sake of clarity , we call IS ( DC ) and IS ( TC ) the DC and TC sides of the IS , respectively . The IS ( DC ) and IS ( TC ) seem to organize as multicentric signaling hubs consisting of surface proteins , including adhesion and costimulatory molecules , associated with cytoplasmic components , which comprise cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules . Most of the studies on the IS have focused on the IS ( TC ) , and the information on the IS ( DC ) is still sparse . However , the data available suggest that both IS sides are involved in the control of TC activation . The IS ( DC ) may govern activities of DCs that confer them the ability to activate the TCs . One key component of the IS ( DC ) is the actin cytoskeleton . Herein , we discuss experimental data that support the concept that actin polarized at the IS ( DC ) is essential to maintaining IS stability necessary to induce TC activation .

INTRODUCTION Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are the most potent antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ; Banchereau and Steinman , 1998 ) . There are two main groups of DCs : conventional and plasmacytoid ( Banchereau and Steinman , 1998 ; Merad et al . , 2013 ) . DCs are found in tissues in the immature diﬀerentiation stage . In the presence of pathogens , they undergo a process of diﬀerentiation called maturation , which involves multiple phenotypical changes , including the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC - I ) and class II ( MHC - II ) and costimulatory molecules , like CD80 and CD86 . Mature DCs migrate to the lymph nodes ( LNs ) , where they present pathogen - derived peptides via MHC - I to CD8 + T cells ( TCs ) or via MHC - II to CD4 + TCs , resulting in the activation of these lymphocytes . Hereafter , unless otherwise indicated , when we use the word DCs , we refer to the conventional mature DCs . Several studies have shown that activation of naïve TCs in the LNs involves , ﬁrst , brief serial DC - TC encounters , which are antigen independent , followed by prolonged and stable antigen - dependent contacts that last several hours ( Delon et al . , 1998 ; Iezzi et al . , 1998 ; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 1 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 679500 fcell - 09 - 679500 July 29 , 2021 Time : 17 : 3 # 2 Rodríguez - Fernández and Criado - García Actin at the Immunological Synapse Stoll et al . , 2002 ; Bajenoﬀ et al . , 2003 ; Bousso and Robey , 2003 ; Mempel et al . , 2004 ; Miller et al . , 2004 ; Shakhar et al . , 2005 ; Celli et al . , 2007 ) . Finally , the TCs recover their motility and proliferate ( Mempel et al . , 2004 ; Celli et al . , 2007 ; Scholer et al . , 2008 ) . The region of tight adhesion that connects DCs and TCs when they establish stable interactions is called the immunological synapse ( IS ) . We call the DC and TC sides of the IS the IS ( DC ) and IS ( TC ) , respectively . Most studies on the IS have centered on the IS ( TC ) , and analyses of the IS ( DC ) are sparse ( Riol - Blanco et al . , 2009 ; Rodriguez - Fernandez et al . , 2010a , b ; Benvenuti , 2016 ; Verboogen et al . , 2016 ; Gomez - Cabanas et al . , 2019 ; Alcaraz - Serna et al . , 2021 ) . Herein , we analyze the role of the ﬁlamentous - actin ( F - actin ) cytoskeleton of the IS ( DC ) in TC activation . ORGANIZATION OF THE PLASMA MEMBRANE PROTEINS COMPONENTS OF THE IS ( DC ) The ﬁrst studies on the IS focused on the IS ( TC ) ( Monks et al . , 1998 ; Grakoui et al . , 1999 ) . In one of the experimental models used , the CD4 + TCs were plated on a glass - supported lipid bilayer that was converted into a surrogate APC by inserting the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) , the ligand of the integrin lymphocyte function - associated antigen ( LFA - 1 ) , and peptides bound to MHC ( pMHC ; Grakoui et al . , 1999 ) . In another model , the CD4 + TCs were allowed to form IS with B cells ( BCs ; Monks et al . , 1998 ; Grakoui et al . , 1999 ) . Following the binding of the TCs either to the glass - supported lipid bilayer or to the BCs , the costimulatory molecule CD28 and the TC receptor ( TCR ) clustered together in a region called the central supramolecular activation cluster ( cSMAC ) . Contiguous to this region are found LFA - 1 molecules that form a ring called peripheral SMAC ( pSMAC ) . Large negatively charged molecules like CD43 and CD45 organize in an outermost ring called distal SMAC ( dSMAC ; Monks et al . , 1998 ; Grakoui et al . , 1999 ; Freiberg et al . , 2002 ) . Interestingly , when the DCs form the IS with TCs ( naïve or activated ) at the IS ( TC ) , instead of the monocentric organization described above , surface proteins form multiple protein clusters that include TCRs , adhesion proteins , and costimulatory molecules ( Brossard et al . , 2005 ; Rothoeft et al . , 2006 ; Reichardt et al . , 2007 ; Fisher et al . , 2008 ; Tseng et al . , 2008 ; Thauland and Parker , 2010 ) . The ability of the DCs to promote multicentric IS ( TC ) could contribute to explain why they are such potent APCs . Numerous clusters of CD3 and costimulatory molecules multiply the signaling from these receptors , resulting in robust TC activation ( Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . Supporting this concept , TCs plated on surrogate - patterned APCs that promote TCR or CD28 clusters show enhanced functionality ( Mossman et al . , 2005 ; Shen et al . , 2008 ) . POLARIZATION OF F - ACTIN AT THE IS ( DC ) The following examples , in which ﬁxed cells were stained with phalloidin , show that F - actin polarizes in the IS ( DC ) upon allogeneic or antigen - speciﬁc DC - TC formation . Allogenic conjugates include ( i ) bone marrow - derived DCs ( BM - DCs ) ( BALB / c genetic background ) and CD4 + TCs ( C57BL / 6 genetic background ) ( Al - Alwan et al . , 2001b ) and ( ii ) human monocyte - derived DCs and allogeneic lymphoblasts ( Riol - Blanco et al . , 2009 ) . Antigen - speciﬁc conjugates include ( i ) OVA peptide - loaded BM - DC , from BALB / c or C57BL / 6 mice , and DO11 . 10 or OTII CD4 + TCs , respectively ( Al - Alwan et al . , 2003 ; Eun et al . , 2006 ; Riol - Blanco et al . , 2009 ) , and ( ii ) OVA peptide - loaded BM - DCs and OTI CD8 + TCs ( Tanizaki et al . , 2010 ) . A drawback of these ﬂuorescence microscopy analyses performed with ﬁxed conjugates is that it is diﬃcult to know for certain whether the phalloidin - stained F - actin belongs to the IS ( TC ) or the IS ( DC ) . However , recently , the use of Lifeact , an amino acid fragment of the protein ABP140 that binds selectively to F - actin , has solved this problem ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ; Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . High - resolution confocal microscopy analysis of Lifeact - green ﬂuorescent protein ( Lifeact - GFP ) - expressing DCs that form IS with OTII CD4 + TCs shows that F - actin displays at the IS ( DC ) a multifocal organization , with foci of diﬀerent sizes separated by regions where actin is sparse ( Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . Finally , ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments performed with mCherry - labeled actin - transfected BM - DCs that interact with OTII TCs showed a slower recovery at the IS ( DC ) compared with the cortex , suggesting a higher stability and speciﬁc molecular features of the F - actin network at the IS ( DC ) ( Malinova et al . , 2016 ) . SURFACE PROTEINS THAT INDUCE ACTIN ACCUMULATION IN THE IS ( DC ) Engagement of MHC - II , MHC - I , or LFA - 1 with speciﬁc antibodies bound to polystyrene beads induces F - actin accumulation only in DCs that bind to beads associated with anti - MHC - II antibodies ( Al - Alwan et al . , 2003 ) . The lack of eﬀect of MHC - I was unexpected because F - actin accumulates at the IS ( DC ) in DC - OTI CD8 + TC conjugates ( Tanizaki et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , engagement of MHC - I on the membrane of endothelial cells with antibodies induces activation of the F - actin regulator ras homolog family member A ( RhoA ) ( Coupel et al . , 2004 ; Lepin et al . , 2004 ) and actin organization ( Lepin et al . , 2004 ; Jin et al . , 2007 ; Ziegler et al . , 2012a , b ) . Hence , other experimental strategies , including diﬀerent anti - MHC - I antibodies , should be used before ruling out that MHC - I controls F - actin accumulation in DCs . An analysis of wild - type ( WT ) - BM - DCs or CD80 / 86 knock - out ( KO ) - BM - DCs interacting with DO11 . 10 CD4 + TCs suggests that CD80 / CD86 induces actin polarization at the IS ( DC ) ( Rothoeft et al . , 2006 ) . However , actin failed to accumulate at the IS ( DC ) upon engagement of CD86 on DCs with antibodies or when BM - DCs , expressing that the CD28 receptors CD80 and CD86 interact with human Jurkat cells expressing murine CD28 ( Al - Alwan et al . , 2003 ; Rothoeft et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , stimulation of CD80 or CD86 is not suﬃcient to promote F - actin aggregation . Finally , the semaphorin receptor Plexin - A1 , which is localized at the IS ( DC ) , can also induce RhoA activation and F - actin polarization in this region ( Eun et al . , 2006 ) .

When analyzing these experimental data , it is important to take into consideration several points . First , the focus of most of the studies available on this issue was not the IS ( DC ) . Second , the proteins analyzed can be expressed in the IS ( DC ) and elsewhere in DCs , like the DCs’ cortex ( e . g . , F - actin , WRC , WASP , and Myo9b ) , implying that these proteins may exert their regulatory eﬀects inside and / or outside the IS ( DC ) ( e . g . , WASP , Rac1 / 2 , and mDia also regulate migration ) . Third , actin - regulatory proteins can also govern actin - independent functions ( e . g . , HS1 ) . Fourth , the experimental strategies employed to study the role of these molecules , namely , the use of pharmacological agents to inhibit F - actin or DCs deﬁcient in actin - regulatory proteins , do not discriminate between the IS ( DC ) and other intracellular regions . Filamentous Actin To analyze the role of F - actin at the IS ( DC ) , pharmacological agents have been used that alter actin stability , including cytochalasin D , latrunculin A , and mycalolide B ( MycB ) , which disrupt F - actin , and Jasplakinolide , which stabilizes it ( Fenteany and Zhu , 2003 ) . When DCs treated with any of these inhibitors interact with DO11 . 10 or OTII CD4 + TCs , the activation and proliferation of these lymphocytes is inhibited ( Al - Alwan et al . , 2001b ; Leithner et al . , 2021 ; Table 1 ) . These results emphasize the importance of the integrity of the DCs’ actin cytoskeleton for TC activation ( Al - Alwan et al . , 2001b ; Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . Confocal microscopic analyses of DCs that interact with Lifeact - GFP expressing OTII CD4 + TCs show that IS ( TC ) form multiple actin foci ( Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . However , when DCs pretreated with MycB to disrupt F - actin were allowed to interact with the Lifeact - GFP OTII CD4 + TCs , ∼ 50 % of the IS ( TC ) present a ring of F - actin surrounding an actin - free circle , instead of a multifocal actin organization ( Leithner et al . , 2021 ; Table 1 ) . Hence , multifocal actin at the IS ( DC ) contributes partially to stabilizing multifocal actin at the IS ( DC ) and predictably also to FIGURE 1 | Actin and actin - regulatory proteins at the IS ( DC ) .

These proteins cycle between inactive ( GDP - bound ) and active ( GTP - bound ) states , which can interact with effector proteins that relay downstream signaling . This cycle is regulated by speciﬁc guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , which catalyze the release of the bound GDP that is replaced by GTP , and by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) , which induce GTP hydrolysis .

Finally , F - actin at the IS ( DC ) can also control DC - TC adhesion by selectively regulating the lateral mobility on the plasma membrane of ICAM - 1 ( Comrie et al . , 2015 ) . Immobilized ICAM - 1 at the IS ( DC ) can promote LFA - 1 activation on the IS ( TC ) and increase DC - TC adhesion ( Feigelson et al . , 2010 ) . Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome Protein Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) is a nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) that activates the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex ( Figure 1 ) . Arp2 / 3 is an actin - nucleation factor ( ANF ) that assembles actin dimers or trimers that serve as nuclei that subsequently polymerize into Y - branched actin networks ( Schonichen and Geyer , 2010 ) . WASP organize in foci within the IS ( DC ) ( Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . WASP - KO BM - DCs show reduced motility and lower F - actin levels ( Bouma et al . , 2011 ; Malinova et al . , 2016 ) . WASP - KO BM - DCs that interact with OTII CD4 + TCs in vitro present a high number of transient interactions and reduced DC - TC contact areas , suggesting that in the DCs , WASP may stabilize the interactions with the TCs ( Bouma et al . , 2011 ; Malinova et al . , 2016 ; Table 1 ) . Similar conclusions have been obtained in in vitro and in vivo studies that analyze the interactions between WASP - KO BM - DCs and OTI CD8 + TCs ( Pulecio et al . , 2008 ) . At the IS ( DC ) formed by the WASP - KO BM - DCs , the levels of ICAM - 1 and MHC - II are reduced ( Malinova et al . , 2016 ) . The levels of TCR , LFA - 1 , F - actin , and talins are also reduced at the IS ( TC ) . Moreover , TCR - dependent signaling was also altered , resulting in reduced IL - 2 production , and TC proliferation ( Bouma et al . , 2011 ; Malinova et al . , 2016 ) . Further supporting a role for the WASP / Arp2 / 3 axis in IS formation , DCs that express Y293F - WASP ( a mutation that impairs WASP’s ability to activate Arp2 / 3 ) display a low number of IS with TCs and reduced priming ability ( Bouma et al . , 2011 ) . Finally , in FRAP experiments performed with Cherry - labeled actin - transfected WASP - KO , Y293F - WASP , and WT - BM - DCs that formed IS with OTII CD4 + TCs , actin recovery at the IS ( DC ) was slower in the WT DCs compared with the WASP - KO and Y293F - WASP DCs , suggesting that WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated formation of branched actin stabilizes the actin network at the IS ( DC ) ( Malinova et al . , 2016 ) . Hematopoietic Lineage Cell - Speciﬁc Protein 1 Hematopoietic lineage cell - speciﬁc protein 1 ( HS1 ) is a NPF that induces Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin networks , and , moreover , it can also bind and stabilize this network ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ; Uruno et al . , 2003 ; Hao et al . , 2005 ; Dehring et al . , 2011 ; Figure 1 ) . Since HS1 expression increases during DC maturation ( Huang et al . , 2011 ) , it is interesting to study whether this molecule could regulate actin organization at the IS ( DC ) and DCs’ priming ability ( Table 1 ) . WT and HS1 - KO BM - DCs bind and present OVA peptides equally as well with DO11 . 10 CD4 + TCs ( Huang et al . , 2011 ) . However , HS1 - KO BM - DCs loaded with intact OVA protein display a reduced ability to activate the CD4 + TCs ( Huang et al . , 2011 ) . WT and HS1 - KO BM - DCs present the MHC - I - restricted VSV8 peptide equally as well with the CD8 + TC hybridoma N15 . However , when VSV8 was complexed with the protein GRP94 , which also uses the MHC - I pathway of antigen presentation , the priming ability of the HS1 - KO BM - DCs was impaired . It was observed that receptor - mediated endocytosis was selectively inhibited in the HS1 - KO BM - DCs , preventing antigen uptake ( Huang et al . , 2011 ) . It was also found that HS1 is required for antigen uptake because it participates , together with dynamin 2 , in the scission of the endocytic vesicles ( Huang et al . , 2011 ) . Hence , although HS1 is a NPF , it apparently regulates antigen presentation through the control of antigen endocytosis . WAVE Regulatory Complex WASP - family verprolin homologous proteins ( WAVE ) regulatory complex ( WRC ) is an NPF that activates Arp2 / 3 and induces branched actin ( Buracco et al . , 2019 ; Figure 1 ) . WRC is found in the IS ( DC ) , but it also associates with F - actin at the DC cortex ( Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . Upon interaction of WRC - deﬁcient BM - DCs ( Park et al . , 2008 ) with OTII CD4 + TCs , F - actin displays a multifocal organization in the IS ( TC ) , like the IS ( TC ) formed by the WT BM - DCs ( Leithner et al . , 2021 ; Table 1 ) . However , F - actin levels at the IS ( DC ) are reduced , suggesting that WRC promotes actin accumulation in this region . WRC - deﬁcient DC - TC contacts last longer and display larger areas of contact ( Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . These prolonged interactions are associated with an increase in the levels of the phospho - ezrin - radixin - moesin ( ERM ) , suggesting a higher anchoring of ICAM - 1 to cortical F - actin , which may result in the immobilization of this ligand and increased LFA - 1 - mediated DC - TC adhesion ( Comrie et al . , 2015 ; Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . These abnormal long - lasting interactions between WRC - deﬁcient DCs and TCs may explain the observed reduction in the activation of the TCs ( Leithner et al . , 2021 ) . Mammalian Homolog of Diaphanous Mammalian homolog of diaphanous ( mDia1 ) is an ANF of the formin family that promotes F - actin elongation ( Schonichen and Geyer , 2010 ; Figure 1 ) . The mDia - KO - BM - DCs display reduced adhesion and impaired migration ( Tanizaki et al . , 2010 ) . CD4 + TCs that establish alloreactive interactions with mDia - KO BM - DC also presented reduced proliferation and low interferon - γ ( IFN - γ ) production ( Table 1 ) . Two - photon microscopy analysis shows that mDia - KO BM - DCs that interact with OTII CD4 + TCs or with OTI CD8 + TCs establish brief contacts within the LNs , indicating that DCs’ mDia is important for keeping stable ISs ( Tanizaki et al . , 2010 ) . Hence , correct TC activation requires of mDia1 expression in the DCs . Fascin Fascin is an actin - bundling protein whose expression is increased during DC maturation ( Mosialos et al . , 1996 ; Al - Alwan et al . , 2001a ; Yamashiro , 2012 ) . In mature DCs , fascin , which can localize to the IS ( DC ) , controls dendrite formation ( Al - Alwan Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 6 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 679500 fcell - 09 - 679500 July 29 , 2021 Time : 17 : 3 # 7 Rodríguez - Fernández and Criado - García Actin at the Immunological Synapse et al . , 2001a , b ; Rothoeft et al . , 2006 ; Figure 1 ) . In antigen - speciﬁc models of IS formation , accumulation of fascin and F - actin correlates with more extended contacts between DCs and TCs , increased TC proliferation , and CD4 + Th1 TC - dependent responses ( Rothoeft et al . , 2006 ) . Using an allogeneic model of IS formation , it is observed that the levels of fascin in DCs correlate with the ability of these cells to stimulate the TCs ( Al - Alwan et al . , 2001a ; Table 1 ) . Finally , in an alloreactive IS model , it was observed that a reduction of fascin levels in the BM - DCs with antisense oligonucleotides inhibits their ability to allostimulate the TCs ( Al - Alwan et al . , 2001a ) . Therefore , fascin - mediated bundling of F - actin in DCs contributes to TC priming . Switch - Associated Protein 70 Switch - associated protein 70 ( SWAP - 70 ) is a Rac GEF ( see Table 1 and legend ) that also controls F - actin bundling ( Gomez - Cambronero , 2012 ; Chacon - Martinez et al . , 2013 ; Figure 1 ) . Although WT and SWAP - 70 - KO DCs express similar total MHC - II levels , SWAP - 70 - KO BM - DCs show a reduced expression of MHC - II on the plasma membrane ( Ocana - Morgner et al . , 2009 ) . OVA peptide - loaded SWAP - 70 - KO DCs’ ability to prime TCs is impaired ( Ocana - Morgner et al . , 2009 ) , as shown by their reduced ability to activate two diﬀerent MHC - II - restricted TC hybridomas ( Regnault et al . , 1999 ; Blander and Medzhitov , 2006 ) . In SWAP - 70 - KO DCs , the actin regulatory GTPases RhoA and RhoB are constitutively activated , resulting in an increase in the amount of F - actin in these cells ( Ocana - Morgner et al . , 2009 ; Sit and Manser , 2011 ) . Inhibition of RhoA and RhoB in the SWAP - 70 - KO DCs with Clostridium botulinum increased MHC - II on their plasma membrane and helped recover their ability to activate the TCs . Hence , it is suggested that the high F - actin levels prevent the correct MHC - II localization on the plasma membrane ( Bretou et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , SWAP - 70 may inhibit RhoA and RhoB activation , which prevents an abnormal increase in F - actin and allows MHC - II localization on the membrane of the DCs ( Ocana - Morgner et al . , 2009 ) . Myosin IXb Myosin IXb ( Myo9b ) is a cytoskeletal motor that displays Rho - GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) activity ( see Table 1 and legend ) . Myo9b colocalizes with F - actin in DCs ( Hanley et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2014 ; Figure 1 ) . Compared to WT - BM - DCs , KO - Myo9B BM - DCs present a low number interaction with OTII CD4 + TCs , although these interactions last longer ( Xu et al . , 2014 ) . F - Actin is highly increased in the IS ( DC ) of the KO - Myo9B BM - DCs that form IS with OTII CD4 + TCs . However , KO - Myo9B BM - DC - OTII CD4 + TCs’ interactions resulted in reduced proliferation within 3D - collagen matrices but not in liquid co - cultures ( Xu et al . , 2014 ) . These results could be due to the diﬀerent spatiotemporal organization of F - actin in the IS ( DC ) of the KO - Myo9B DCs under both conditions ( Xu et al . , 2014 ) . RhoA , Rac1 and Rac 2 RhoA , Rac1 , and Rac 2 belong to the Rho GTPase subfamily , which are critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton ( see Figure 1 , and Table 1 and legend ) ( Sit and Manser , 2011 ) . Treatment of the DCs with epidermal cell diﬀerentiation inhibitor ( EDIN ) toxin , which inactivates RhoA , or inhibition of its downstream target , the Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) , with Y27632 , failed to aﬀect IS formation between BM - DCs and OTII CD4 + TCs ( Benvenuti et al . , 2004 ) . These results suggest that the eﬀects of knocking down SWAP - 70 on F - actin discussed above could be mediated by RhoB , instead of RhoA . DCs deﬁcient in Rac1 and Rac2 show alterations in the F - actin organization , resulting in the absence of dendrites and reduced motility . In vitro analyses show that Rac1 / 2 - KO BM - DCs do not form stable contacts with CD4 + TCs . Consistent with these results , the Rac1 / 2 - KO BM - DCs show a reduced ability to activate OTII CD4 + TCs . It was suggested that this inhibition was due to deﬁcient actin dynamics in the Rac1 / 2 - KO DCs that prevent these cells from engulﬁng and establishing full contacts with TCs ( Benvenuti et al . , 2004 ) . Cytohesin - Interacting Protein ( CYTIP ) Although CYTIP is not an actin - regulatory protein , we have included it in this review because it regulates LFA - 1 , which is an important molecule at the IS ( DC ) ( Figure 1 ) . In resting DCs , LFA - 1 remains on the plasma membrane in an inactive state ; that is , it cannot bind to its ligand ICAM - 1 . DCs express cytohesin - 1 , which interacts with the cytoplasmic β - subunit of LFA - 1 , resulting in its activation and binding to ICAM - 1 . CYTIP binds to cytohesin - 1 , which translocates from the membrane to the cytoplasm , leaving LFA - 1 inactivated . During DC maturation , CYTIP levels increase and localize to the IS ( DC ) ( Hofer et al . , 2006 ) . Studies on CYTIP in DCs are controversial ( Table 1 ) . In experiments in which CYTIP was reduced with siRNA in human DCs ( Hofer et al . , 2006 ) , these cells showed a diminished ability to induce proliferation of autologous antigen - speciﬁc CD8 + TCs ( Hofer et al . , 2006 ) . Other studies show that knocking down CYTIP with siRNA in BM - DCs extends antigen - speciﬁc contacts with OTII CD4 + TCs or OTI CD8 + TCs and reduces the activation and proliferation of these cells ( Balkow et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , in experiments performed with DCs obtained from CYTIP KO mice ( Coppola et al . , 2006 ) , CYTIP KO BM - DCs enhanced antigen - speciﬁc activation OTI and OTII TCs ( Heib et al . , 2012 ) . CONCLUDING REMARKS The study of the role of F - actin at the IS ( DCs ) is at its inception . The data discussed above suggest that F - actin polarization at the IS ( DC ) maintain IS stability necessary to induce TC activation . A network of actin - regulatory proteins controls F - actin organization at the IS ( DC ) ( Figure 1 ) . The pharmacological disruption of F - actin , the knockdown of Rac1 / 2 , or the increase of F - actin levels after knocking down Myo9b reduce the ability of the DCs to activate the TCs . Knockdown of WASP or WRC , which promotes branched actin through Arp2 / 3 , or mDia , which regulates linear F - actin , or fascin , a bundling protein , results in inhibition of TC activation . Deletion of WASP , mDia , fascin , and Rac1 / 2 reduces the number and / or the duration of DC - TC contacts . In contrast , knockdown of WRC or Myo9b results in extended DC - TC contacts and inhibition of TC activation . In summary , perturbation of F - actin dynamics at the IS ( DC ) leads to the inhibition of TC activation .
