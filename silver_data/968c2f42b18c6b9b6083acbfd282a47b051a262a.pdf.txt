For over a year , the worldwide pandemic has ravaged the whole globe , with approximately 250 million verified human infection cases and a mortality rate surpassing 4 million . While the genetic makeup of the related pathogen ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) was identified , many unknown facets remain a mystery , comprising the virus’s origin and evolutionary trend . There were many rumors that SARS - CoV - 2 was human - borne and its evolution was predicted many years ago , but scientific investigation proved them wrong and concluded that bats might be the origin of SARS - CoV - 2 and pangolins act as intermediary species to transmit the virus from bats to humans . Airborne droplets were found to be the leading cause of human - to - human transmission of this virus , but later studies showed that contaminated surfaces and other environmental factors are also involved in its transmission . The evolution of different SARS - CoV - 2 variants worsens the condition and has become a challenge to overcome this pandemic . The emergence of COVID - 19 is still a mystery , and scientists are unable to explain the exact origin of SARS - CoV - 2 . This review sheds light on the possible origin of SARS - CoV - 2 , its transmission , and the key factors that worsen the situation . Keywords SARS - CoV - 2 · Health threat · Origin · Epidemiology · Variants · Environmental factors Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) has been designated a public health emergency by the World Health Organiza - tion ( WHO ) because of the rising threat to global health ( Ciotti et al . 2020 ) . COVID - 19 was initially discovered on December 30th , 2019 , as a novel virus - associated infection ( Ciotti et al . 2020 ; Wu et al . 2020a , b , c , d , e ) . As a result , millions of people became infected , and hundreds of thou - sands of people were killed throughout the globe by this novel coronavirus ( Chakraborty and Maity 2020 ; Danese et al . 2020 ) . It has been confirmed that a highly contagious new coronavirus known as SARS - CoV - 2 is liable for the COVID - 19 pandemic ( Khan et al . 2020 ) and causes severe acute respiratory syndromes ( Anderson et al . 2020 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 is transferred to humans via inhalation of virus - laden liquid droplets ( Fig . 1 ) , intimate interaction with a diseased individual , or SARS - CoV - 2 - contaminated surfaces . Clinical observations in confined spaces have sug - gested aerosol transmission as an additional yet important pathway ( Anderson et al . 2020 ; Ge et al . 2020 ; Zhang et al . 2020a , b , c , d ) .

Following the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong , one study found that airborne spread might have played a sig - nificant role in transmitting this disease . Because it is prob - lematic to collect virus - containing aerosols in real - world settings and difficult to measure at low concentrations , there is a lack of SARS - CoV - 2 aerodynamic characteristics and transmission pathways in aerosols ( Farhangrazi et al . 2020 ) . Of the four endemic human coronaviruses , SARS - CoV - 2 has many similarities . Human coronaviruses are HCoV - OC43 , HCoV - HKU1 , HCoV - 229E , and HCoV - NL63 , all endemic in the USA and Asia ( Holmes et al . 2021 ) . There are four structural proteins in the coronavirus virion : nucleocapsid ( N ) , membrane ( M ) , envelope ( E ) , and spike ( S ) . The S glycoprotein mediates the viral particle’s entrance into the host cell , including attachment to the mem - brane and fusion ( Lu et al . 2020a , b ) . The virion’s membrane contains many copies of the S protein , which is assembled as a homotrimer , giving the virion its crown - like appear - ance . Many viruses , such as HIV - 1 , Ebola virus , and avian influenza viruses , have entry glycoproteins that split into two subunits—the extracellular and transmembrane subu - nits—in the infected cells before the virus is released ( Lan et al . 2020 ) . Some coronaviruses cleave their S protein in the infected cells into S1 and S2 subunits , whereas other coronaviruses do not . Furin , a proprotein convertase found in virus - producing cells , cleaves the S protein of SARS - CoV - 2 and MERS - CoV ( Hoffmann et al . 2020 ; Shang et al . 2020 ) . S1 binds ACE2 , and S2 fixes S protein to the membrane in a mature virion , thus having two non - covalently linked subu - nits on its surface . The fusion peptide and other machinery required to affect membrane fusion following infection of a new cell are included in the S2 subunit ( Jackson et al . 2022 ) . For a virus to spread to a new species , the proteins’ docking and entrance into the new host cells must be pre - adapted or rapidly evolved . Six amino acids in the spike protein’s receptor - binding domain are essential for SARS - CoV - 2’s ability to attach to the host target receptor angi - otensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) and infect humans ( Lan et al . 2020 ) . This receptor binding site ( RBD ) of SARS - CoV - 2 shows better efficiency at binding with human ACE2 ( hACE2 ) than the original SARS - CoV RBD , mak - ing it easier for the virus to move into cells ( Jackson et al . 2022 ) . However , SARS - CoV - 2’s whole spike protein shows a comparable or lower total hACE2 binding affinity than SARS - CoV , suggesting that the SARS - CoV - 2 RBD , despite its higher efficiency , becomes less accessible than the SARS - CoV RBD ( Han et al . 2022 ) . Because SARS - CoV - 2 uses proprotein convertase furin to activate itself before enter - ing target cells , it is less likely to be blocked by endosomal proteases ( Jackson et al . 2022 ) . The strong hACE2 bind - ing affinity of the RBD , the preactivation of the spike by furin , and the presence of a hidden RBD in the spike may enable SARS - CoV - 2 to enter cells efficiently while avoiding immune monitoring ( Shang et al . 2020 ; Muus et al . 2021 ; Han et al . 2022 ) . Many studies were conducted to investigate the host res - ervoir of SARS - CoV - 2 , and bats were considered the main origin of this pandemic . Whereas these crucial spike protein residues are absent from the coronavirus collected from the horseshoe bat , RaTG13 ( which has a 96 % resemblance to SARS - CoV - 2 ) , they are present in the coronavirus sampled from the pangolin ( Dejnirattisai et al . 2021 ) . According to the SARS - CoV - 2 genome sequence , no recent recombination Fig . 1 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission to humans via inhalation of virus - laden liquid droplets and various stages of lung damage .

It is unknown what evolutionary modifications occurred before or during the human transition because of the inade - quate coronavirus sampling from nature and the wide variety of animals with comparable ACE2 receptors ( such as pigs , ferrets , cats , and non - human primates ) ( Yu et al . 2020 ) . The emergence of COVID - 19 is still a mystery , and scientists are unable to explain the exact origin of SARS - CoV - 2 . This review article sheds light on the possible origin of SARS - CoV - 2 , its transmission throughout the world ( by epidemio - logical model and collecting data from published letters and reports ) , and the key factors responsible for COVID - 19’s transition from an epidemic to a pandemic . Origin of SARS‑CoV‑2 Animals Human coronaviruses and most other viruses are descended from zoonotic sources . This new zoonotic virus , SARS - CoV - 2 , has many characteristics in common with other zoonotic viruses . The ancestor of SARS - CoV - 2 , i . e . , corona - viruses , is reported to spread disease in animals , and animals transmit that disease to humans ( Fig . 2 ) . SARS - CoV viruses belong to the beta class of coronaviruses , and animals are their host reservoirs that transmit disease to humans . It bears striking similarities to SARS - CoV , which infected people twice , first in Foshan , China ( in November 2002 ) and again in Guangzhou ( in 2003 ) ( Meyers et al . 2005 ) . In 2019 , live raccoon dogs and civets were sold in the Wuhan markets ( Xiao et al . 2021 ) and were well - known to be vulnerable to SARS - CoV - 2 contagion ( Guan et al . 2003 ) . These SARS - CoV emergence episodes have been linked to marketplaces selling live animals ( Freuling et al . 2020 ) . Bats are considered the natural host for SARAS - CoV - 2 ( Zhou et al . 2020 ; Zhao et al . 2020 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 and RaTG13 ( found in bats ) have a phylogenetic relationship of 40 to 70 years , indicating a recent divergence ( Zhao et al . 2020 ) . Such a difference may also indicate the pres - ence of more than one intermediary host in the chain of evi - dence . Although that theory has not been proven yet , some researchers believe the virus may be spread through pango - lins ( Zhou et al . 2020 ; Zhang et al . 2021 ) . There was some doubt that SARS - CoV - 2 arose from coronaviruses found in pangolins , but the research showed otherwise ( Zhang et al . 2021 ) . Snakes have also been proposed as possible inter - mediate hosts , but this concept seems to have been ruled out ( Fam et al . 2020 ) . In general , scientists believe that the SARS - CoV - 2 virus results from animal origin ( Fam et al . 2020 ) , although no evidence of this has yet been found in the wild . Fig . 2 Coronavirus classification and their reservoirs / host . There are 4 main classes of coronavirus ( α , β , γ , δ ) . All four classes of viruses can infect animals , but only α - and β - class coronavirus can cause disease in humans and animals are the natural host of these viruses 69119 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 Bats have drawn attention to studying their link with SARS - CoV - 2 because previous SARS - CoV outbreaks emerged because of bats and serve as their natural and ancestral reservoirs ( MacLean et al . 2021 ) . Since the SARS outbreak in 2002 , their mobility—gained via flying—has been recognized as a feature that may improve disease dis - semination . As a result , researchers discovered more viruses in this population . A new study reveals that rats and bats , which are frequently identified as the “villains” in epi - demics , are neither more nor less important as reservoirs of viruses . They have the potential to spread this virus to humans , then other species , as would be expected for the most diverse groups of mammals ( Pereira et al . 2020 ) . There is a link between greater viral transmission potential and more frequent interaction with animals , such as goats , pigs , and cattle , that humans keep ( Mollentze and Streicker 2020 ) . It is impossible to fully understand viral transmission dynamics from animals to people until we thoroughly search for viruses flowing in a larger taster group of all animal spe - cies . The following animals ( bats and pangolin ) are consid - ered the origin of this disease because of the resemblance of the identified virus with SARS - CoV2 . The details of this reported research work are as follows : Bats The COVID - 19 epidemic has been accompanied by a torrent of data pointing to bats as the source . Despite this , no con - clusive research to date links bats specifically to the SARS - CoV - 2 virus , which resulted in the COVID - 19 pandemic . Researchers started looking for a new host after sequencing the virus that causes SARS in humans ( Wu et al . 2020a , b , c , d , e ) . As much as 96 % of the SARS - CoV - 2 genome is found in the genome of the coronavirus RaTG13 , which was previously identified in Chinese Rhinolophus affinis bats ( Zhou et al . 2020 ) . Fam et al . ( 2020 ) show that SARS - CoV - 2 has evolved into a human - specific pathogen in recent years . Once a coro - navirus has developed to the extent where it can traverse species barriers again , the competition to infect Homo sapi - ens and other species becomes even more ferocious , as new mutations and recombination drive the never - ending arms race between hosts and diseases . A situation like this illus - trates how difficult it is for non - specialists to understand the procedure and the subject matter . This also contributes to inaccurate and hasty interpretations since diseases’ transmis - sion methods are not always fully and correctly communi - cated to the general population . For reasons of uncertainty or haste , bats were wrongly blamed for COVID - 19 even though they had nothing to do with it . The outcomes have been disastrous for a group that already has a poor public image due to unjust stereotypes . According to reports all across the globe , maltreatment , destruction , and ruin of bat perches and colonies have risen dramatically since the pandemic outbreak ( Fenton et al . 2020 ; Zhao 2020 ) . As a result of these actions , 1421 bat species that have been identified will be endangered , as well as the essential ecological services they offer ( Zukal 2020 ) . The pollination of thousands of plant species , comprising agronomic “pests” and infection trajectories for humans and viable animals , seed dispersion and territory rejuvenation , control of insect populations , and habitat regeneration are examples of such activities ( Kunz et al . 2011 ; Ghanem and Voigt 2012 ) . As reported by Liu et al . ( 2021a , b ) , the SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) was found to bind to bat ACE2 ( bACE2 ) from Rhinolophus macro - tis ( bACE2 - Rm ) with a lower affinity than human ACE2 ( hACE2 ) . Its infectivity to host cells expressing bACE2 - Rm was revealed with pseudo - typed SARS - CoV - 2 virus and SARS - CoV - 2 wild virus . RBD binding manner comparable to hACE2 was found in the SARS - CoV - 2 RBD with the Rm bACE2 - Rm complex . The interaction network , includ - ing Y41 and E42 of bACE2 - Rm , differed significantly from hACE2 based on examining binding specifics between SARS - CoV - 2 RBD and bACE2 - Rm . The RBD binding resi - dues in the bACE2 receptor differed significantly across bat species , owing to their wide range of species . Since many bats are known to have the mutant allele , the bACE2 - Rm binding capacity is significantly reduced , suggesting that the Y41H allele is critical to this interaction network . Pangolin SARS - CoV - 2 has been found in bats and is transmitted to humans via the pangolin . According to reports , coronavirus infection has caused illness in pangolins , indicating that they are not a natural reservoir for the virus . However , this does not rule out the likelihood that the pangolin is helping to spread the disease to people . During the COVID - 19 epi - demic , researchers at Guangdong Wildlife Rescue Center in China identified a SARS - like CoV in the lung testers of 2 dead Malayan pangolins with foamy fluid in their lungs and pulmonary fibrosis . Following up on earlier studies , it was discovered that all the viral infections obtained from 2 human lung testers ( lung07 and lung08 ) showed little simi - larities , varying from 80 . 24 to 88 . 93 % for known SARS - CoVs ( Abdelgawad 2020 ) . Pangolin lung samples have previously been studied by Zhang et al . ( 2020a , b , c , d ) and contain SARS - CoV - like CoVs ( 2019 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 - like CoV ( called pangolin - CoV ) was discovered in deceased Malayan pangolins , according to genomic and evolutionary data . Pangolin - CoV has 91 % identity with SARS - CoV - 2 and 95 % identity with BatCoV RaTG13 at the whole - genome level . Only RaTG13 and 69120 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 pangolin - CoV are more meticulously linked to SARS - CoV - 2 than any other CoV . Pangolin - S1 CoV’s protein has a signifi - cantly closer relationship to SARS - S1 CoV - 2’s protein than to RaTG13 . RaTG13 contains four amino acid substitutions , while pangolin - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 share five essential amino acid residues interacting with human ACE2 . Pango - lin - CoV and RaTG13 lost the SARS - CoV - 2 - like supposed furin recognition sequence pattern at the S1 / S2 cleavage site . This study’s results also show that pangolins are a natural host for SARS - CoV - 2 - like CoV viruses . Researchers found that the E proteins of coronaviruses isolated from Malayan pangolins had 99 . 6 % amino acid identity with SARS - CoV - 2 , whereas the M proteins shared 98 . 6 % , the N proteins shared 90 . 7 % , and the S proteins shared 90 . 7 % identity ( Lau et al . 2020 ) . There is just one non - critical amino acid difference between the receptor - binding domain of the pangolin - CoV S protein and that of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Zhang et al . 2020a , b , c , d ) . Xiao et al . ( 2020a , b ) reported that SARS - CoV - 2 was created when two viruses related to pangolin - CoV recombined with a virus associated with RaTG13 to form a new virus . One - third of the Malayan pangolins tested positive for pangolin - CoV . Clinical symptoms and histological abnormalities were seen in infected pangolins , and pangolins and circulating anti - pangolin - CoV antibodies reacted with the S protein of SARS - CoV - 2 . Pangolin coronaviruses are closely correlated to SARS - CoV - 2 , which means they may serve as interme - diate hosts for the virus . If the illegal wildlife trade is not successfully regulated , this recently discovered coronavirus from pangolins—the most traded mammal—could poten - tially harm human health in the future . Insects Insects are a sustainable and innovative source of protein . Crickets , mealworms , and fly larvae are increasingly pro - duced as food for humans or as feed for livestock . Like any other food ingredient , insects produced for food or feed must comply with the European Food Safety Author - ity ( EFSA ) regulations . Such compliance is controlled by national food safety authorities such as the Dutch Food Safety Authority ( NVWA ) . WUR , UG , and UC scientists execute ongoing research programs on insects as a sustain - able source of feed for circular agriculture and the diseases insects may contract during their production ( Akhtar and Isman 2018 ) . The virus responsible for COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , requires living cells to replicate . The virus needs to bind to these living cells to enter the cell . The virus origi - nates from bats and can reproduce in a limited number of mammalian species , including the pangolin and humans . Such “hosts” have receptors ( ACE2 ) outside the cell that can bind the virus . In humans , cells high in the nostrils , lungs , and colon express an ACE2 receptor that can bind SARS - CoV - 2 . This ACE2 receptor is the same receptor that binds other coronaviruses , including the SARS virus that caused an epidemic in 2003 ( Lange et al . 2020 ; Bosso et al . 2020 ; Zhang et al . 2020a , b , c , d ) . The roles and substrate specificity of insect ACE - homologs have not been thoroughly studied , even though sufficient evidence has been discovered in many insect spe - cies on the significance of ACEs in proper growth and devel - opment . This suggests insect ACEs do not function as com - ponents of the renin - angiotensin systems seen in vertebrates since insects have an open circulatory system ( Turner and Hooper 2002 ) . Because they only have one domain , insect ACEs resemble vertebrate testicular ACEs . ACEs can be found in various insect tissues and cell types due to their widespread distribution . As a result , ACEs may have many biological roles . ACE is over - expressed in the testes of many insect species , which impacts male fertility in those species ( Honda et al . 2006 ; Guo et al . 2017 ) . Insects have high ACE levels in their gut tissues , indicat - ing that the ACE of the insect Spodoptera littoralis has a role in gut hormone production . Both neuropeptide processing and the neuropile areas , where ACE is found , are likely to be involved in the brain tissues of insects . The ACE transcripts in locust Locusta migratoria hemocytes were 10 times higher after an immune assault , suggesting that ACE is involved in cellular defense ( Dicke et al . 2020 ) . In animals , the coronavirus first manifests itself or appears before affecting humans . Infected animals may spread these viruses to humans via direct contact with them or by eating meat or other items that have not been properly processed . For example , ticks , which may spread encephali - tis , are mini - dangerous pests that killed over 150 , 000 people in 2015 since they are the most frequent carriers . Scientists have discovered the causal agent of encephalitis and many other viruses to persist for almost 13 years inside the tick insect shell . A tick insect can spread disease to both humans and other animals in its lengthy existence . Both viruses have the potential to spread noninvasively to new victims , per - haps infecting them repeatedly . Worldwide , more than 60 illnesses are linked to fly exposure . They infect both ani - mals’ food and skin , in addition to humans’ . Additionally , dirt flies are mechanical disease vectors since their filthy bodies can transfer disease - causing bacteria to our meals , eyes , noses , mouths , and open wounds ( Thyssen et al . 2015 ) . From ancient times until the medieval ages , fleas were the primary vectors of the plague . These tiny parasites are very bouncy , allowing them to move long distances and enter almost any environment . Numerous diseases , such as hel - minthiasis , encephalitis , and others , can be transmitted to domestic animals and humans . Even though the Middle Ages are long gone , fleas that feed on bats could still carry the COVID - 19 virus ( Ismail et al . 2020 ) . 69121 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 Cockroaches are particularly hazardous due to their ugly appearance and ability to move quickly . They multiply at a breakneck pace and feast on everything in their path . In addition to leaving droppings and germs that may cause food poisoning , they are among the most infamous pests n premises . They transfer harmful microorganisms , such as bacteria , viruses , and fungus , to infected places , in addition to contaminating food ( Portnoy et al . 2013 ) . Their dirty , noc - turnal lifestyles make them perfect carriers for many harmful bacteria . Cockroaches are tropical insects , and many patho - genic bacteria have been identified , including Salmonella spp . , Shigella spp . , and K . pneumonia . In addition , cock - roaches have been discovered to have a variety of parasites and fungi on their exterior and interior surfaces ( Kakumanu et al . 2018 ) . Many dangerous and difficult - to - treat illnesses are spread by mosquitoes , including encephalitis , malaria , and other vector - borne diseases such as dengue fever . The virus infects approximately 200 million individuals annually across the world ' s most populous regions . Because of their limited lifespan , they may infect a large number of individu - als with contaminated blood in their scrotums ( Khah and Khoozani , 2020 ) . Blood - sucking arthropods like mosquitoes and lice have not been reported to transmit COVID - 19 ( Gomes 2020 ) . The disease could be transmitted via contact with contaminated items and even the feces of sick individuals by cockroaches and houseflies , which are major disease mechanical vectors . Only a few instances of the live virus found in a patient ' s feces have been documented ( Morawska and Milton , 2020 ) . Up to 53 . 4 % of COVID - 19 patients had SARS - CoV - 2 in their feces ( Young et al . 2020 ; Tang et al . 2020a , b , c ) . Even though stool samples remained positive , respiratory sam - ples from approximately 23 % of patients no longer tested positive for the virus ( Xiao et al . 2020a , b ) . In 98 COVID - 19 patients , data revealed that virus shedding continued for almost 5 weeks in the stool ( Wu et al . 2020a , b , c , d , e ) . According to another study , patients are still shedding the virus 30 days after infection . SARS - CoV - 2 levels in the stool can be high in people who do not exhibit any disease symp - toms ( Xie et al . 2020 ) . However , SARS - CoV - 2’s capacity to survive little is understood ; the virus can stay intact in the environment for days , leading to fecal – oral transmission . This study was conducted by Zhang et al . ( 2020a , b , c , d ) . In a report , 15 cockroach surface swabs were examined by nested RT - PCR for the presence of the SARS coronavirus , and nested RT - PCR obtained only one questionable positive result for the cockroach surface ( Forni et al . 2017 ) . Feces can be a sig - nificant source of COVID - 19 transfer , although the func - tion and significance of this pathway remain unknown . The virus’s long - term survival in the environment means that any creature that comes into contact with or feeds on human excrement could play a part in COVID - 19 transmission , even if the organism tests negative . It follows that insects ' involve - ment in COVID - 19 transmission is critical . Because these insects feed on various foods , they touch a wide range of human remains , including food , excrement , and vomit , as well as a variety of water droplets and catarrhs , and they spread these contaminants throughout their habitat and into the surrounding area . There is a good chance that insects may spread the SARS - CoV - 2 virus , which could speed up an infection or extend clinical trials because of the virus’s large size and prevalence in feces , droplets , and surfaces ( Ismail et al . 2020 ) . Through these investigations , it is concluded that insects also have ACE receptors , but their function is different compared to hACE receptors due to the open cir - culatory system . Hence , they cannot be the host reservoir for SARS - CoV2 , but due to their contact with households , feces , foodstuffs , etc . , they might be the carrier of virus transmission . Laboratory escape Accidentally laboratory escaped viruses have been reported in the literature . Examples include SARS - CoV and labora - tory incidents that resulted in single illnesses or short - term transmission chains ( Kirchdoerfer and Ward 2019 ) . There have been no known laboratory escapes of viruses capa - ble of infecting people other than the Marburg virus ( Bray and Chertow 2017 ) , and all of them have been related to long - term work in high - titer cultures ( Adenowo et al . 2015 ; Lashley 2004 ) . Only one human epidemic or pandemic has been recorded due to scientific activity : the A / H1N1 influ - enza pandemic of 1977 , most likely caused by a large - scale vaccination challenge experiment ( Sutton 2018 ) . Before the COVID - 19 pandemic , no epidemic was sparked by the emergence of a new virus , and there is no indication that the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) —or any other labora - tory—was studying SARS - CoV - 2 or any other virus closely enough to serve as an antecedent before it spread . When RNA is extracted , viruses are inactivated ; thus , regular viral genome sequencing deprived of cell culture at the WIV offers a minimal risk ( Yan et al . 2020 ) . There have been no reported viral samples escaping the lab after sequencing . Known laboratory epidemics have been linked to index cases’ coworkers and family members and the lab where they originated ( Sallard et al . 2021 ; Ristanović et al . 2020 ) . While the early instances of the COVID - 19 pandemic were extensively traced , no cases have been linked to the WIV’s laboratory personnel , and all employees at Dr . Shi Zhengli’s laboratory were claimed to be seronegative for SARS - CoV - 2 when tested in March 2020 ( Koopmans et al . 2021 ) , with the laboratory adopting proper biosafety procedures throughout their coronavirus work ( Frutos et al . 2021 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 disease reports must be confirmed during high influenza 69122 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 spread and other respiratory viral transmissions before they can be considered viable ( Liu and Wu 2020 ) . Bat - derived samples are abundant at the WIV ( Starr et al . 2020 ) , and three SARS - CoVs have been successfully grown from the bat—WIV1 , WIV16 , and Rs4874—according to the WIV’s report ( Wu et al . 2020a , b , c , d , e ) . All three viruses are more relatable to SARS - CoV than SARS - CoV - 2 ( Zhou et al . 2020 ; Chen et al . 2020 ) . RaTG13 has never been isolated or cultured , and the unique nucleotide sequence is derived from short sequencing reads of the WIV bat virus ( Rahalkar and Bahulikar 2020 ) . In Vero E6 cells , it was found that the SARS - CoV - 2 furin cleavage site was miss - ing during serial amplification , making it unable to culture the three fecal viral isolates ( Cantuti - Castelvetri et al . 2020 ; Cele et al . 2021 ; Sasaki et al . 2021 ; Wong et al . 2020a , b ) . Using these methods ; a SARS - CoV - 2 progenitor virus with a completely intact furin cleavage site would be very difficult to isolate . Alternative techniques , such as developing new reverse genetics systems to spread contagious SARS - CoVs recognized in bats’ sequencing records , have not been docu - mented at the WIV . To conduct gain - of - function research , scientists will likely need a known SARS - CoV genomic mainstay or , at the very least , a virus that has already been identified via sequencing . WIV researchers have utilized a genetic mainstay ( WIV1 ) distinct from SARS - CoV - 2 in pre - vious coronavirus recombinant research ( Zhou et al . 2020 ) , and SARS - CoV - 2 shows no indication of genetic markers one would anticipate from laboratory studies ( Cascella et al . 2021 ) . The WIV ( Wu et al . 2020a , b , c , d , e ) has never pub - lished or researched a SARS - CoV - 2 - like virus , and there is no proof that the WIV sequenced a virus that is more relat - able to SARS - CoV - 2 than RaTG13 . One possible scenario for laboratory egress is accidental infection during serial transit of a SARS - CoV in commu - nal laboratory animals , such as mice . SARS - CoV - 2 isolates from the commencement of the epidemic could not infect mice of the wild type ( Graham and Baric 2020 ) . While the hACE2 transgenic mouse model is convenient for studying contagion in vivo and testing vaccinations , it frequently results in slight or atypical disease in the animals . There is no confirmation to support the theory that this virus was chosen for its enhanced virulence and transmissibility by passing through susceptible rodents repeatedly . Even though SARS - CoV - 2 has been created ( Corbett et al . 2020 ) and seri - ally transmitted to mice ( Hu et al . 2021 ) , specific mutations in the spike protein , particularly N501Y , are needed for such adaption in mice ( Li et al . 2021 ) . Consider that N501Y has occurred in many human SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern , indicating that it was selected to enhance the affinity of ACE2 for the virus ( Kuzmina et al . 2021 ) . For example , mutations like N501Y are required for SARS - CoV - 2 repli - cation in an animal model . However , there is no indication that mutations like N501Y occurred early in the epidemic . Based on the low pathogenicity of frequently employed labo - ratory animals and the lack of genetic markers related to rodent adaptation , it is very unlikely that laboratory workers acquired SARS - CoV - 2 during viral pathogenesis or gain - of - function investigations ( Holmes et al . 2021 ) . Transmission Epidemiological model In order to develop predictions regarding pathogen evolu - tion , we must consider the possibly complicated interplay between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics . Thus , developing an appropriate model of SARS - CoV - 2 epidemi - ology is a critical first step . According to data collected from different regions , the median duration between contagion and the commencement of symptoms is 5 days ( Lauer et al . 2020 ) . In addition , it has been shown that infectiousness begins 2 . 5 days before the development of symptoms , with increased spread occurring before signs . Viral loads then fall following the symptoms’ start and are reduced by half within 2 – 4 days ( Miura et al . 2021 ) . These findings indi - cate that there is a non - infectious exposed stage as well as a highly infectious presymptomatic period . Once infected , people may get well on their own or develop a more serious illness with a greater death ratio . The total case mortality for symptomatic people is predicted to be 1 – 2 % ( Giordano et al . 2020 ) . The typical duration of a death warning is about eighteen days ( Verity et al . 2020 ) . Lastly , some diseased people show no symptoms throughout the illness . Buitrago - Garcia et al . ( 2020 ) estimate that 29 % of patients still show no symptoms . However , they caution that this might be an exaggeration because of publication unfairness and the need for a minimum of one person with no symptoms in most studies . In terms of the origins of novel contagions , their research indicates that presymptomatic cases account for 40 – 60 % of new contagions , with 10 % coming from people with no symptoms and the rest from those with symptoms . As they emphasize , these figures remain unclear . COVID - 19 is depicted in Fig . 3 and may be employed to study the epi - demiology and development of SARS - CoV - 2 under a variety of realistic conditions . Published reports Within China The WHO was notified on December 31 of a cluster of pneu - monia in Wuhan , China , with an unclear cause ( Wu et al . 2020a , b , c , d , e ) . A new coronavirus ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) was quickly discovered and described by Chinese officials as the outbreak’s causal pathogen only days afterward ( Zhou 69123 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 et al . 2020 ) . The outbreak began with a solitary or several zoonotic transmission events at a wet market in Wuhan where wild animals and meat were sold , and by the 29th of January 2020 , there had been 5997 confirmed cases in China and 68 confirmed cases in different foreign countries as a consequence of the pandemic ( Riou and Althaus 2020 ) . Two key features influence the virus’s potential to spread . In early epidemics , the basic reproduction number R0 repre - sents the typical number of secondary cases produced by an infectious index case in a completely susceptible population . If R0 increases beyond 1 , the human - to - human transmission will continue with long transmission chains . Second , the variation in the number of secondary cases across individu - als reveals more about the epidemic’s expected dynamics and the likelihood of superspreading occurrences ( Keeling and Rohani 2011 ; Wu et al . 2020a , b , c , d , e ; Van Doremalen et al . 2020 ) . A limited number of primary cases could cause many secondary cases if the pathogen is not disseminated among a large number of individuals . Even though super - spreading is very rare , it has the potential to cause a large - scale and rapid spread , which could have a major impact on the course of an epidemic . On the other hand , low dispersion would lead to a steadier spread of the disease , with a more homogeneous distribution of secondary cases per primary case . This significantly affects control efforts ( Keeling and Rohani 2011 ) . The scientific community was concerned that the new coronavirus might transmit to former topographical areas comprising other nations via direct human - to - human con - tact , despite initial reports from Wuhan stating that there were only a few tens of cases in the cluster and no direct human - to - human spread had been detected ( Yue et al . 2020 ) . Hundreds of cases and a few household clusters have been documented since early January , when the epidemic quickly started to increase ( Lai et al . 2020a , b ; Tang et al . 2020a , b , c ) . There have been 830 instances in China as of 24 Janu - ary 2020 , with 549 being spotted in Hubei , 26 in Beijing , 20 in Shanghai , and 53 in Guangdong . Twenty - six people have died as a result of the epidemic ( Lai et al . 2020a , b ; Nishiura et al . 2020 ) and 13 cases have been transferred to Japan , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , Thailand , Vietnam , and the USA as of 22 January 2020 ( Nishiura et al . 2020 ) . Some of the world’s major and most compactly inhab - ited cities are in Guangdong Province and the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region . There are several major cities in Guangdong , comprising Guangzhou ( 12 million peo - ple ) , Shenzhen ( 10 million people ) , Dongguan ( 8 million people ) , and Foshan ( 8 million people ) . Hubei Province , where the first instances of COVID - 19 were discovered , has good transit connections with the province . During the spring festival season , which began on the 10 of January 2020 , the Wuhan - Guangzhou high - speed train is expected to transport between 0 . 1 million and 0 . 2 million people daily . Guangdong has the largest number of confirmed COVID - 19 cases outside Hubei Province ( 1388 ) through the 19th of March 2020 ( Lu et al . 2020a , b ) . Fig . 3 A proposed epidemiological trend of SARS - CoV - 2 . Presymptomatic and asymptomatic stages are more contagious to the transmission of COVID - 19 69124 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 Following the initial reports of patients with undetected pneumonia on the 30th of December 2019 , increased monitoring was implemented in all clinics in Guangdong Province . Patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and those who had traveled within 14 days after the start of their symptoms were first selected for screening and sampled for SARS - CoV - 2 . The first instance was discov - ered in Guangdong on the 1st of January and reported on the 19th of January 2020 ( Ling and Leo 2020 ) . The number of cases of COVID - 19 in Guangdong increased till the beginning of February 2020 ( when there were more than 100 cases per day ) , then decreased . In Guangzhou , no more than one locally infected case was recorded per day after the 22nd of February 2020 . However , from the beginning of March 2020 , there has been a rise in the num - ber of COVID - 19 instances introduced into Guangdong from other countries . A total of 102 imported cases from 19 different countries have been recorded as of the 26th of March 2020 , indicating the danger of local COVID - 19 emergence re - igniting in China ( Lu et al . 2020a , b ) . In Zhoushan , Zhejiang Province , China , Tong et al . ( 2020 ) examined a 2 - family cluster of SARS - CoV - 2 - in - fected individuals in January 2020 . It was determined that the illnesses were caused by interaction with a traveler from Wuhan , Hubei Province , who was already infected but had not yet shown symptoms . The Zhoushan Cent - ers for Disease Control and Prevention Ethics Committee evaluated and approved our epidemiological study ( CDC ) . One of the 1st two confirmed instances of SARS - CoV - 2 was found in two professors from the same department at a university in Zhoushan , China , on 05 January 2020 , after they attended an academic symposium organized by the university . Person W , a 45 - year - old Wuhan teacher , came on 05 January for the conference and dined with people A and D on 06 January using the same serving plates as before . Person W became ill with a fever , cough , sore throat , and general malaise on 08 January after return - ing to Wuhan on 07 January . Based on the patient’s self - report , he went to a nearby hospital and was diagnosed with COVID - 19 by a Chinese CDC office . There was just one known exposure for individuals A and D to SARS - CoV - 2 , and that was during a feast and symposium with person W . Wanzhou District is a 1 . 74 - million - person Chinese city in Chongqing’s municipality on Hubei Province’s western border , where Wuhan is the province’s capital . The COVID - 19 epidemic in China , which originated in Wuhan , rapidly spread to Wanzhou , the city’s entrance from Hubei Prov - ince . At the Spring Festival vacation in late January 2020 , around 20 , 000 people came back to Wanzhou from Hubei Province . Wuhan and the surrounding regions were placed under quarantine on 23 January 2020 , making Wanzhou an ideal location for epidemiological research ( Shi et al . 2021 ) . Wanzhou recorded 183 confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 instances and 1983 close interactions that were negative for the virus from 21 January to 10 April 2020 . Of the 123 verified cases , 67 . 2 % were symptomatic , and 32 . 8 % were asymptomatic ( including 5 instances not recorded in Wanzhou ) . Indi - viduals with positive reverse transcriptase PCR ( RT - PCR ) findings who had signed before going to a hospital for the 2 - week isolation period as a nearby interaction , through - out the hospital stay , or within 4 weeks after being released from the hospital were considered symptomatic cases . Peo - ple with positive RT - PCR findings who had no indications before being identified and did not exhibit any signs during the isolation period and treatment , as well as for 4 weeks following release from the hospital , were considered asymp - tomatic cases since they did not show any symptoms . Nearby associates who were negative for SARS - CoV - 2 had contact with the patients but were not infected with it themselves . People who had intimate contact with an infected person were infected , whether ill or not . Unconfirmed instances from Wuhan with no RT – PCR findings were removed from the study , but close connections between those patients were included . About 67 . 2 % and 32 . 8 % of patients were symptomatic and asymptomatic , respectively . Of the over - all transmissions documented , 75 . 9 % were asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmissions ( Shi et al . 2021 ) . It is the 14th of January 2020 , and a 56 - year - old Chi - nese guy ( the index patient ) is flying from Guangzhou to Xuzhou , China , where he shows no symptoms after 6 h of transfer at Wuhan’s Hankou Station ( China ) . From the 14th to the 22nd of January , he was in close contact with his two daughters , a pregnant 32 - year - old teacher ( patient 1 ) and a 21 - year - old undergraduate ( patient 2 ) . His 42 - year - old son - in - law ( patient 3 , the spouse of patient 1 ) was admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University in Xuzhou on 15 January and was discharged on 23 January . As well , during the weeks of 2 – 19 January , patient 4 ( a 62 - year - old male ) was in the hospital recovering after pancreatic surgery in the same ward as patient 3 ( a 34 - year - old woman ) ( patient 5 ) . Patients 4 and 5 were in close contact with the index patient from 15 to 18 January , when he was asymptomatic . He was sent home on 19 January and kept in touch with his 56 - year - old wife for the rest of the month ( patient 6 ) ( Li et al . 2020 ) . Xuzhou Medical University’s Affiliated Hospital admitted the index patient with fever , cough , and sore throat symp - toms on 25 January . Testing revealed that the patient had COVID - 19 . His condition deteriorated quickly ; he had a rapid respiratory rate of 38 breaths / min and a low satura - tion level on the oximeter of 93 % . From January 26 to 31 , six more members of the two households tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 using real - time fluorescence reverse tran - scription PCR on throat swab samples . These individuals’ 69125 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 medical situations were all unique in some respects ( Li et al . 2020 ) . This cohort research studied a community COVID - 19 epidemic in Zhejiang province . On 19 January 2020 , 128 people traveled 100 min round trip on two buses to attend a 150 - min worship service ( 60 [ 46 . 9 % ] on bus 1 and 68 [ 53 . 1 % ] on bus 2 ) . A passenger on bus 2 provided the source patient . On the one hand , we looked at the risks of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in those who took bus 1 or bus 2 ( n = 60 ( source patient omitted ) ) ; on the other hand , we looked at the risks in people who attended the worship service in gen - eral ( n = 172 ) . To compare COVID - 19 risk , we separated the exposed bus seats into high - and low - possibility areas , depending on the patient’s distance . The central air condi - tioners on both buses were set to indoor recirculation ( Shen et al . 2020 ) . Other countries The genetic sequence of a virus can tell us a lot about whether or not two different viruses , separated in time and location , are epidemiologically connected . Early SARS - CoV - 2 epidemics in North America differed in timing , geo - graphical origins , and transmission patterns , according to genomic data from Washington State ( Worobey et al . 2020 ; Bedford et al . 2020 ) , the East Coast ( Fauver et al . 2020 ; Gonzalez - Reiche et al . 2020 ) , California ( Deng et al . 2020 ) , and British Columbia ( BC ) , Canada ( Worobey et al . 2020 ; Moreno 2021 ) . Virus strain ( “WA1” ) identified in Wash - ington state was firstly reported in a tourist returning from Wuhan , China , on 15 January 2020 , and seemed to be 1st reported case in the USA ( Holshue et al . 2020a , b ; Worobey et al . 2020 ) . Following the discovery of genetically identi - cal viruses to WA1 in Washington , Connecticut , Califor - nia , British Columbia , and elsewhere , it was speculated that WA1 might have begun a cryptic transmission chain on 15 January and remained undiscovered for many weeks . This introduction may predate other known SARS - CoV - 2 com - munal spread networks elsewhere on the continent , mak - ing Seattle the hub of the North American pandemic if it is accurate ( Worobey et al . 2020 ) . According to Holshue et al . ( 2020a , b ) , the 1st instance of SARS - CoV - 2 infection was discovered in the USA in January of that year , and reports of community transmis - sion quickly followed ( Spellberg et al . 2020 ) . The coronavi - rus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic continues to have a substantial influence on the USA , with more than 9 mil - lion illnesses and 230 , 000 fatalities being recorded as of 01 November 2020 ( Christie et al . 2021 ) . Thus , SARS - CoV - 2 infections are being underreported due to limited testing options and mild and asymptomatic illnesses ( Yousaf et al . 2020 ) . Therefore , seroprevalence studies are critical for improving estimates of infection and transmission ( Havers et al . 2020 ) . Between 27 July and 24 September 2020 , Bajema et al . ( 2021 ) collected leftover patient sera from samples for monotonous screening ( e . g . , cholesterol , thyroid ) or clinical management in 50 US states , Washington DC , and Puerto Rico and examined them in two commercial labs ( labora - tory A and laboratory B ) . Laboratory A gathered samples from seven states ( Arizona , Indiana , Maryland , Pennsylva - nia , New Jersey , New York , and Virginia ) , while laboratory B , which had previously participated in a CDC - led sero - prevalence study , supplied residual sera from 45 other states . SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies were detected using chemilumines - cent immunoassays , and de - identified data on patient age , sex , condition , and specimen collection date were submitted to the CDC . Of the 177 , 919 serum samples analyzed , 103 , 771 ( 58 . 3 % ) came from women , 26 , 716 ( 15 . 0 % ) from people 17 years old or younger , 47 , 513 ( 26 . 7 % ) from people 65 years old or older , and 26 , 290 ( 14 . 8 % ) came from people living outside of major urban areas . The seroprevalence at the jurisdic - tional level varied from less than 1 % to 23 % throughout four collecting periods . Fewer than 10 % of individuals developed detectable SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in 42 out of 49 countries with enough data to assess seroprevalence over time . Preva - lence estimates vary by gender , age group , and metropolitan / nonmetropolitan location . Seroprevalence estimates in all jurisdictions show that the changes from period 1 to period 4 were less than 7 percentage points , and they varied by loca - tion . According to the results of this cross - sectional research , most people in the USA did not have prior serologic evi - dence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection as of September 2020 , but prevalence varied greatly depending on the jurisdiction . On 23 January 2020 , a tourist from Wuhan brought SARS - CoV - 2 into Singapore for the first time . COVID - 19 has been detected among additional tourists and returning passengers , with some local transmission occurring ( Wong et al . 2020a , b ) . The Singapore Ministry of Health issued a health warning on 02 January 2020 , after the initial reports of an unusual pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan , China , recom - mending that patients with pneumonia and contemporary tourism to Hubei Province be tested for SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion . All patients with probable SARS - CoV - 2 infection were quarantined using airborne and connection safeguards . Twenty - eight SARS - CoV - 2 - infected individuals were identified in Singapore between 23 January and 03 Feb - ruary 2020 , with symptoms appearing between 14 and 30 January 2020 , according to a study by Young et al . ( 2020 ) . All patients had visited Wuhan , China , during the previ - ous 14 days before becoming sick . Contact tracing method found four patients ( 22 % ) , while border screening identified three ( 17 % ) . There were 18 patients , with 16 ( 89 % ) Chinese and 2 ( 11 % ) Singaporeans . There were five groups of close 69126 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 people : family members , friends , or coworkers . Eighteen patients traced their contact information , resulting in 264 close Singaporean connections . On 25 February 2020 , no illnesses were found in health care professionals who had treated COVID - 19 patients . Over 300 , 000 people died , and over 13 million people were infected in Brazil during the COVID - 19 epidemic , according to official figures as of March 2021 . The state of Amazonas in northern Brazil has been the most severely impacted due to SARS - CoV - 2 infection and illness burden varying greatly across the country ( Menezes et al . 2021 ) . By October 2020 , serological monitoring of blood donors in Manaus , Amazonas’ capital and the region’s biggest city , suggests cumulative attack rates of > 67 % ( Buss et al . 2021 ) . Many other towns and cities in the surrounding area have similar but slightly lower seroprevalences . As a result , the city’s health care system has been under considerable strain since late 2020 and early 2021 as an outcome of a prompt resurgence of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and mortality ( Fongaro et al . 2021 ) . Despite previously high infection levels , cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection resurfaced in Manaus , Brazil , by the end of 2020 . According to genome sequencing of viruses collected during that time , a new SARS - CoV - 2 variant has appeared and is circulating in Manaus , Brazil , between November 2020 and January 2021 . A trio of spike protein mutations ( K417T , E484K , and N501Y ) found to be correlated with increased binding to the human ACE2 receptor was acquired by lineage P . 1 , which included 17 mutations . The emergence of P . 1 was predated by a period of accelerated molecular evolution , according to a Molecular Clock analysis con - ducted in the middle of November 2020 . Based on genomic and mortality data , we anticipate that P . 1 could be 1 . 7 to 2 . 4 times more transmissible than non - P . 1 and that prior infection with non - P . 1 offers 54 to 79 % protection against P . 1 infection . Improved worldwide genomic monitoring of potentially more transmissible and immune - evading varia - tions is essential for speeding up the response to a pandemic ( Faria et al . 2021 ) . The first Austrian case was found in Kühtai , Tyrol , on 24 and 26 January 2020 , in a person exposed to the virus by a Chinese teacher in Starnberg , Germany , on 20 and 22 January . Since her diagnosis was fully confirmed on 28 Janu - ary in Munich ( Germany ) , this qualifies as a German case . Two instances were diagnosed in Innsbruck on February 25th , imported from Italy , but no further cases were found in Austria . On the 27th of February , three illnesses among Austrian citizens were discovered in Vienna . There were 6 instances in the first cluster ( from an unknown source ) and 61 instances in the second cluster ( from a recognized source ) . The latter cluster was most likely spawned in Italy . After returning from a voyage ship tour of Italy , a 69 - year - old Viennese man was identified with COVID - 19 and died on 12 March in a Vienna hospital . On the 6th of March , the Tyrol reported three locally acquired cases , all linked to the ski resort of Ischgl . In Ischgl , 11 of the 14 Islandic COVID - 19 cases had returned to Iceland by the 29th of February ( Kreidl et al . 2020 ) . The SARS - CoV - 2 infection killed a Vo’ , Italy resident on the 21st of February 2020 , after developing pneumo - nia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus exposure . As far as we know , this is the first fatality in Italy linked to COVID - 19 since the SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak in Wuhan , China . Local officials retaliated by placing the whole municipality under a 14 - day lockdown . Later , during the two surveys , we obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from 2812 and 2343 study participants , respectively , represent - ing 85 . 9 % and 71 . 5 % of the eligible study population . Age - specific percentages ranged from 57 . 1 % to 95 . 4 % in the first poll and 40 . 1 % to 80 . 4 % in the second poll , with a homog - enous sample of all age groups . Surprisingly , the initial poll showed a 2 . 3 % t ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1 . 2 – 2 . 4 % ) of the 2812 people who tested positive for syphilis . Accord - ing to the second survey , a total of 29 people tested positive ( prevalence : 1 . 2 % ; 95 % confidence interval : 0 . 8 – 1 . 8 % ) , 8 of which were new cases ( prevalence : 0 . 3 % ; 95 % confidence interval : 0 . 15 – 0 . 7 % ) ( Lavezzo et al . 2020 ) . To detect imported cases early and avoid secondary trans - mission , enhanced COVID - 19 monitoring was introduced in France on the 10th of January 2020 . To put things in perspective , the NRC at Institute Pasteur in Paris discovered Europe’s first instance of the virus , which was later con - firmed by the WHO . SARS - CoV - 2 infections were initially identified at the NRC - associated laboratory in Lyon and subsequently at first - line hospital labs throughout France , with the Institute Pasteur’s NRC concentrating on northern France , particularly Paris , which has a high density of peo - ple . Those who had symptoms ( fever and respiratory dif - ficulties ) or had been to high - risk regions for infection were given special attention during screening and sampling for SARS - CoV 2 . Asymptomatic infection or a mild illness was among the many possible clinical manifestations of COVID - 19 infection as the virus propagated across the population ( Stoecklin et al . 2020 ) . From 15 January to 04 April 2020 , Furuse et al . ( 2020 ) examined clusters of COVID - 19 patients and suspected pri - mary cases in Japan . Some groups had more than 100 cases and were associated with healthcare and care institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes . Local transmission and an increase in the pandemic occurred after the second wave of imported COVID - 19 cases hit Japan . Notably , clusters of COVID - 19 cases in hospitals and care institutions predomi - nated in epidemiologic weeks 11 ( 9 – 15 March ) and 14 ( 30 March – 04 April ) , which resembled around 3 weeks after the 2 waves of imported instances . A healthcare facility could be near the end of the native spread chain since clusters at these 69127 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 institutions only appeared after community transmission had already been ongoing for many weeks . Several COVID - 19 clusters have been linked to events , such as singing at karaoke night festivities , encouraging clubs , conversing in pubs , and working out in gyms that involve deep breathing . According to other research , these activities may contribute to the spread of illness in commu - nities . Japanese officials from the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Health , Labor , and Welfare warned the public about three circumstances that might upsurge their risk of contracting COVID - 19 . They recommended that they avoid the “Three Cs” : poorly ventilated enclosed spaces , crowded public places , and close - contact settings ( Furuse et al . 2020 ) . A 68 - year - old male with a severe acute respiratory infec - tion ( SARI ) , chills , and dyspnea was admitted to hospital A in Qom ( Iran ) on 12 February 2020 . Iran’s National Influ - enza Center ( NIC ) at the School of Public Health , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , took his throat swab sample on 15 February and submitted it to the center for influenza testing . It turned out he did not have influenza . His health worsened , and he passed away from respiratory failure on the 16th of February , 5 days after his symptoms appeared . On 18 February , the National Institutes of Health ( NIC ) detected SARS - CoV - 2 in his sample , and on 19 February . On 07 February 2020 , patient 2 ( a 75 - year - old male with SARI , chills , and dyspnea ) became sick and was hospitalized . He died on 16 February due to a negative influenza virus test in NIC on a throat swab sample . As soon as the initial iden - tification of SARS - CoV - 2 was made on 18 February by the National Institutes of Health ( NIC ) , the same test was run on his sample , and it came out positive for SARS - CoV - 2 on 19 February . Samples were taken from all suspected patients hospitalized in Qom after the first SARS - CoV - 2 cases were discovered on 19 February ; five ( 5 / 16 ) tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( Yavarian et al . 2020 ) . The Indian government published details on the first SARS - CoV - 2 patient in Kerala , India , diagnosed in Janu - ary 2020 . The documented patient returned from China and infected everyone who had unprotected contact with them . SARS - CoV - 2 cases with no symptoms have been recorded in significant numbers , making the possibility that asymptomatic patients remained unnoticed all but implausible . There is a wide variance in the number of people impacted throughout India , with Maharashtra reporting the most and Mizoram reporting the least ( Gau - tam and Hens 2020 ) . According to Pakistan’s Ministry of Health , there were 1179 instances of COVID - 19 throughout the country as of 26 March 2020 . Sindh had the most cases at 421 , Punjab at 394 , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 131 , Gilgit - Baltistan at 84 , Azad Jammu , and Kashmir at 25 . Throughout the initial periods of the epidemic , most SARS - CoV - 2 infections in Pakistan were linked to travel . Local viral transmissions are , however , on the rise . COVID - 19 has been linked to the deaths of nine people as of the 26th of March 2020 . The case fatality rate is 0 . 8 % , lower than China , Italy , the USA , and Iran combined . According to epidemiological research using the Susceptible - Infected - Recovered ( SIR ) model , almost 90 million people will get infected in the next several days , with 5 % of those cases necessitating the use of medical facilities ( Raza et al . 2020 ) . Why is COVID‑19 still a global health threat ? Mutations / Adaptations The emergence of different mutated variants of SARS - CoV - 2 worsened the situation and hindered the development of an effective vaccine . The phylogenetic divergence of a disease can reveal information about its past . The phylogeny of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus in humans ( Mavian et al . 2020 ) shows a star - like structure with numerous long - tip branches , which is anticipated in an expanding population . It is pre - dicted that the substitution rate is 0 . 00084 per year based on genomic sampling throughout time ( Day et al . 2020 ) , which is 2 to 6 times lower than the substitution rate for influenza ( Bedford et al . 2015 ) . A genetic mutation occurs approxi - mately every other week in SARS - 30 , 000 - basepair CoV - 2’s genome . Our ability to evaluate genetic variations quickly during an epidemic is made possible by genomic tracking technologies such as Nextstrain ( Hadfield et al . 2018 ) . As of 16 May 2020 , there were 5380 genomes available for analysis . Nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions affect viral protein composition . SARS - CoV - 2 exhibits considerable genetic diversity . However , it is not apparent if these variations have any functional relevance . In many cases , the virus does not affect them ( Tang et al . 2020a , b , c ) , and their numbers have increased due to the virus spreading to new vulnerable hosts . Mutations with no functional relevance vary in frequency , like genetic fingerprints , allowing researchers to monitor the viral geographic distribution and reconstruct epidemiologi - cal patterns . Long - term genetic studies across more distantly related coronavirus lineages show that detrimental mutations are anticipated to be eliminated ( Boni et al . 2020 ) . On the other hand , even harmful mutations may increase in huge numbers during an epidemic if their effective reproduction number is greater than one . The question of whether human nonsynonymous modifications enhance viral fitness is more contentious . The following data summarize the findings of four major research studies on possible adaptive SARS - CoV - 2 mutations , along with warnings regarding their potential dangers . 69128 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 Adaptive mutations in SARS‑CoV‑2 Scientists began looking for signs of adaptation to humans in the SARS - CoV - 2 genomes only a few weeks after the first reports of a new respiratory disease arose from Wuhan , China , in December 2019 . According to one of the first investigations , there were two strains of SARS - CoV - 2 cir - culating in Wuhan ( strains “L” and “S” ) , with the L being more “aggressive” ( Guo et al . 2020 ) . COVID - 19 could become more severe as a consequence of evolutionary change , according to this assertion , which was extensively reported in the media . This conclusion was made only based on frequency data for the two variants , and random muta - tions can thoroughly explain the frequency data on the basal branches of a star - like phylogeny for a rapid dispersal dis - ease ( Kucharski et al . 2020 ) . The original writers subse - quently accepted this more frugal explanation ( Tang et al . 2020a , b , c ) . Korber et al . ( 2020 ) discovered that the non - synonymous mutation D614G in the spike gene has increased frequency in numerous nation - states . Normally , this pattern would be anticipated if the mutation was beneficial , but neutral sampling mechanisms can also explain it . A correspond - ing enhancement in the rate of mutations across states is expected even without selection if travelers first transmit novel disease epidemics from a geographical location with a low mutant rate ( for example , China ) , trailed by travel - ers from a locality where the mutation is ( by chance ) at a high rate ( such as Italy ) . This impartial explanation must be evaluated for plausibility before conclusions are drawn . Hospitalization rates were also examined by Korber et al . ( 2020 ) , but the only viral load was related to genotype . Even then , variables like days from the start of symptoms ( a key predictor of viral load ) were not controlled and could have altered over time as more testing became available . Numer - ous organizations are presently studying the effect of D614G on SARS - CoV - 2 at both the functional and epidemiological levels , and this will provide information on the particular significance of this mutation ( He et al . 2020 ) . A 382 - nucleotide loss in ORF8 has also been reported in Singapore’s COVID - 19 patients , which has attracted media attention . A comparable deletion was identified in several coronaviruses , including SARS variants that emerged during the 2003 – 2004 epidemic , despite the lack of clear evidence that this deletion was positively selected ( Cui et al . 2019 ) . Studies in cell culture showed that a previous SARS deletion slowed viral multiplication ( Muth et al . 2018 ) . The recur - rence of these deletions is interesting , but more research is required to determine whether or not they are associated with illness outcomes or transmission rates . A total of 31 mutations found in the SARS - CoV - 2 genome , including the previously reported D614G muta - tion , were examined via sister clade comparisons by van Dorp et al . ( 2020 ) . As a consequence of their findings , they conclude that little evidence exists for favorably chosen alleles since most mutations are located in clades linked with decreased transmission . On the other hand , sister clade comparisons lack sway and are skewed against identifying derived characteristics that help a lineage advance in the evolutionary process . In mid - November 2021 , a new SARS - CoV - 2 strain ( OMICRON ) was discovered in Gauteng , South Africa . The sophisticated genome sequencing infrastructure in South Africa allows for the early discovery and reporting of novel variations to the rest of the globe . As of December 15 , 2021 , OMICRON instances have been reported in 77 nations , most occurring in the UK , South Africa , and the USA . OMICRON - positive instances have been reported in India as well . The first mortality caused by the novel COVID - 19 strain was reported in the UK ( Thakur and Kanta Ratho 2021 ) . According to Wei et al . ( 2021 ) , Omicron has gained 45 point mutations since diverging from the B . 1 . 1 lineage . There was a more positive selection on the Omicron spike protein sequence than on any previously documented SARS - CoV - 2 variants that have evolved in human hosts , suggesting a chance of host - jumping . There were consid - erable differences in the molecular spectrum ( the relative frequency of the 12 base substitutions ) gained by Omicron’s ancestor from viruses developed in human patients , but they were similar to the spectra associated with viral development in mouse cells . Omicron spike protein changes coincided considerably with SARS - CoV - 2 alterations , which are well - known for facilitating virus adaption to mouse hosts , notably via increased spike protein binding affinity to the mouse cell entry receptor . These findings imply that Omicron’s pro - genitor crossed from humans to mice , collected mutations favorable to infection , and then leapt back into humans , dem - onstrating an inter - species evolutionary trajectory . Table 1 presents different variants of SARS - CoV - 2 . Environmental factors Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania discovered that absolute humidity ( measured as the amount of water in the ambient air ) and temperature were important envi - ronmental variables for the transmission of certain viral infections , in addition to inhabitant mobility and human - to - human interaction ( Shaman et al . 2011 ) . Influenza viruses , for example , are more likely to spread if they are exposed to cold , dry air or droplets . According to a recent study on COVID - 19 , high temperatures might have contributed to increased transmission in 122 Chinese cities , and there was no evidence to support the prediction that COVID - 19 instance tallies would reduce as temperatures increase ( Xie and Zhu 2020 ) . Therefore , the genetic variations between SARS - CoV - 2 strains collected from different regions may 69129 Environmental Science and Pollution Research ( 2022 ) 29 : 69117 – 69136 1 3 be traced back to the countries where they were first discov - ered . This fast - evolving virus can quickly adapt to a vari - ety of different environments . This new coronavirus’s fast proliferation is a global health issue , and climate change may impact how quickly it spreads . COVID - 19 transmission may be influenced by environmental conditions , with dry and cold temperatures increasing the likelihood of the virus spreading ( Su et al . 2016 ) .

A third study showed that the virus thrived in warm , dry conditions ( Bu et al . 2020 ) , whereas a fourth found that transmission decreased as spring and summer arrived ( Oliveiros et al . 2020 ) . Quantifying the link between COVID - 19 transmission and meteorological factors is dif - ficult , as described in a recent article ( Cohen et al . 2020 ) . First , analyzing the time course of COVID - 19 transmission using information collected by a variety of public health organizations may give wildly divergent results about the timing of the epidemic . Estimating Rt using report dates rather than start dates will always lead to substantially dif - ferent findings , as would utilizing instantaneous transmis - sion rates rather than delayed reporting dates to estimate Rt . Third , the choice of techniques to calculate Rt , such as Cori’s approach or Wallinga and Teunis’ method , will lead to temporal changes that complicate the establishment of causal links between weather and transmission ( Pan et al . 2020 ) . Since then , non - pharmaceutical efforts in China to control COVID - 19 have substantially decreased illness dura - tion and outdoor transmission throughout the state . This may have overshadowed the environmental effect of transmis - sion . The last consideration is that comparing weather and transmission connections from one place to another may be complicated by variations in reporting methods between regions ( Lai et al . 2020a , b ) . Kifer et al . ( 2021 ) argued that environmental variables have a vital influence on patients who have already been infected . This winter’s COVID - 19 severity and mortality are likely to worsen , as seen by the decline in seriousness with the arrival of spring . Patients in the early stages of illness may benefit from humidified air since many hospitals have dry air in the winter . The fast - spreading COVID - 19 pan - demic necessitates the promotion of active nasal hygiene and hydration and the humidification of dry air in all warm envi - ronments . This is because our mucosal barrier suffers , and a mucosal barrier is our first line of defense against infection ( Principi and Esposito 2017 ) . Because air - conditioning is an efficient dehumidifier , it is important to monitor humid - ity levels in cooled buildings with restricted access to fresh air . Basray et al . ( 2021 ) found that COVID - 19 incidence was positively correlated with all temperature ranges ( maxi - mum , lowest , and average ) and negatively correlated with humidity , DTR , and rainfall . There was a positive correlation between COVID - 19 mortality rates and temperature and a negative correlation with humidity . For every unit increase in humidity , COVID - 19 cases decreased by 3 . 345 per day , whereas in Karachi , the number of cases increased by 10 . 104 per day . In Gilgit - Baltistan , there was a considerable rise in daily cases of 0 . 534 and 1 . 286 for every unit increase in average temperature and rainfall . Conclusion and future perspectives The World Health Organization has confirmed a pandemic due to the fast global extent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . SARS - CoV - 2 is spread through respiratory droplets produced by infected individuals when they cough or sneeze . The exact origin of SARS - CoV - 2 is still unknown , and studies are being conducted to investigate its source of origin . Many people believe this pandemic is a hoax because the spread of such a disease was predicted in novels , movies , and cartoon shows . Later , however , scientific studies proved that SARS - CoV - 2 is not a laboratory escape virus , confirming these rumors to be just a myth . Until now , scientific studies have shown that bats are the source of SARS - CoV - 2 and pangolins are an intermediary source for transferring SARS - CoV - 2 from bats to humans . The evolu - tion of its various mutant variants and environmental factors ( like temperature , humidity , etc . ) worsen the condition and become a challenge to overcome this disease . This pandemic has shown both the critical nature of national efforts and the world’s interconnectivity and the critical nature of global collaboration for pandemic containment . International health officials must remain alert about SARS - CoV - 2’s trajectory while also evaluating the tactics and approaches employed during the epidemic to create more effective structures and procedures to guarantee a more prosperous and equitable response in the future .
