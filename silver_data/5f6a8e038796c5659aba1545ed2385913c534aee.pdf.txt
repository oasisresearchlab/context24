Theoretical study of vesicle shapes driven by coupling curved proteins and active cytoskeletal forces Miha Fošnariˇc , a Samo Peniˇc , b Aleš Igliˇc , b Veronika Kralj - Igliˇc , a Mitja Drab , b and Nir Gov ∗ c Eukaryote cells have a ﬂexible shape , which dynamically changes according to the function performed by the cell . One mechanism for deforming the cell membrane into the desired shape is through the expression of curved membrane proteins . Furthermore , these curved membrane proteins are often associated with the recruitment of the cytoskeleton , which then applies active forces that deform the membrane . This coupling between curvature and activity was previously explored theoretically in the linear limit of small deforma - tions , and low dimensionality . Here we explore the unrestricted shapes of vesicles that contain active curved membrane proteins , in three - dimensions , using Monte - Carlo numerical simulations . The activity of the proteins is in the form of protrusive forces that push the membrane outwards , as may arise from the cytoskeleton of the cell due to actin or microtubule polymerization occurring near the membrane . For proteins that have an isotropic convex shape , the additional protrusive force enhances their tendency to aggregate and form membrane protrusions ( buds ) . In addition , we ﬁnd another transition from deformed spheres with necklace type aggregates , to ﬂat pancake - shaped vesicles , where the curved proteins line the outer rim . This second transition is driven by the active forces , cou - pled to the spontaneous curvature , and the resulting conﬁgurations may shed light on the organization of the lamellipodia of adhered and motile cells . Curved membrane proteins 1 , for example membrane embed - ded proteins with non - zero intrinsic curvature 2 – 8 , ﬂexible nan - odomains 7 , 9 or curved membrane - attached proteins 1 , 7 , 10 – 12 , have been identiﬁed to play an important role in driving the forma - tion of various membrane shapes 4 , 7 , 13 – 17 . Coupling between non - homogeneous lateral distribution of membrane components and membrane shapes may be a general mechanism for the generation and stabilization of highly curved membrane structures 18 , such as spherical buds , membrane necks , thin tubular or undulated mem - brane protrusions 13 , 14 , 17 , 19 – 29 . In addition , it was found in many cellular processes that the curved proteins , or complexes contain - ing the curved proteins , are able to recruit the cytoskeleton of the cell to produce additional protrusive forces , for example due to actin polymerization 30 , 31 . Such protrusive forces are active , meaning that they consume energy ( ATP ) and maintain the system out of thermal equilibrium 32 . The resulting steady - state conﬁgu - rations of the system may therefore differ from those in thermal equilibrium . Note that in cellular membranes such active forces can originate also from other sources , such as ion pumps 33 , 34 . Curved membrane proteins with a convex shape , such that they induce outwards bending of the membrane , that also recruit the cytoskeletal forces which push the membrane outwards , can serve as efﬁcient initiators of membrane protrusions . This mechanism was ﬁrst suggested theoretically 35 , and has since been found in experiments 36 – 43 . This coupling of convex curvature and recruit - ment of actin polymerization is therefore emerging as an efﬁ - cient cellular mechanism for the production of actin - based protru - sions 44 . It also appears to be exploited by certain viruses during their budding from the infected cell 45 , 46 . Previous studies of the coupling between curved membrane proteins and the cytoskele - tal forces were mostly limited to the linear regime 35 or to sim - a Faculty of Health Sciences , University of Ljubljana , Ljubljana , Slovenia . b Faculty of Electrical Engineering , University of Ljubljana , Ljubljana , Slovenia c Department of Chemical and Biological Physics , Weizmann Institute of Science , Rehovot 7610001 , Israel .

We study here the membrane shapes and the aggregation proper - ties of such systems using numerical simulations , which allow us to go beyond the linear deformations limit . We ﬁnd that the presence of the active protrusive forces affects the phase - separation ( bud - ding ) transition , as well as induces transitions into new classes of shapes that are not accessible in the equilibrium ( passive ) systems . The ability of active processes , associated with curved proteins , to lead to global shape transitions was previously found in numeri - cal simulations 49 , where activity was in the form of proteins with ﬂuctuating spontaneous curvature . 1 Theoretical model The energy of the membrane is expressed as the sum of contri - butions of membrane bending , direct interactions between mem - brane proteins and outward protrusive cytoskeletal forces , W = W b + W d + W F , ( 1 ) respectively . For membrane bending energy the standard Helfrich expres - sion 50 is used , W b = κ 2 (cid:90) A ( C 1 + C 2 − C 0 ) 2 d A , ( 2 ) where the integral runs over the whole area A of the membrane with bending stiffness κ , C 1 and C 2 are principal curvatures and C 0 is the spontaneous curvature of the membrane . The proteins on the membrane are modeled as patches of the membrane with given spontaneous curvature c 0 6 , 9 , 10 . On the patches occupied by the curved proteins we therefore set C 0 = c 0 and elsewhere we assume a symmetric membrane C 0 = 0 . For direct interactions between neighboring proteins we assume 1 a r X i v : 1 8 12 . 01460v1 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 3 D ec 2018 the step potential , W d = − w ∑ i < j H ( r 0 − r ij ) , ( 3 ) where w is a direct interaction constant , the sum runs over all protein - protein pairs , r ij are their mutual in - plane distances , H ( r ) is the Heaviside step function and r 0 is the range of the direct in - teraction . Finally , the energy contribution of the local protrusive forces due to the cytoskeleton is W F = − F ∑ i ˆ n i · (cid:126) x i , ( 4 ) where F is the size of the force , the sum runs over all proteins , ˆ n i is the outwards facing normal to the membrane at the location of the protein i and (cid:126) x i is the position vector of the protein i . Note that the system with the active forces does not generally has global force balance , since the proteins are not symmetrically distributed on the surface of the vesicle . However , we are inter - ested in shape changes , so disregard any center - of - mass motion . 2 Monte - Carlo simulations The membrane is represented by a set of N vertices that are linked by tethers of variable length l to form a closed , dynamically tri - angulated , self - avoiding two - dimensional network 51 , 52 of approx - imately 2 N triangles and with the topology of a sphere . The lengths of the tethers can vary between a minimal value , l min , and a maxi - mal value , l max . Self - avoidance of the network is ensured by choos - ing the appropriate values for l max and the maximal displacement of the vertex s in a single updating step . In this work we used s / l min = 0 . 15 and l max / l min = 1 . 7 . The dynamically triangulated network acquires its lateral ﬂuidity from a bond ﬂip mechanism . A single bond ﬂip involves the four vertices of two neighboring trian - gles . The tether connecting the two vertices in diagonal direction is cut and reestablished between the other two , previously uncon - nected , vertices . The treatment is within the Rouse description , as it ignores the effects of hydrodynamics . The microstates of the membrane are sampled according to the Metropolis algorithm . The probability of accepting the change of the microstate due to vertex move or bond ﬂip is min [ 1 , exp ( − ∆ E / kT ) ] , where ∆ E is the energy change , k is the Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature . The energy for a given microstate is speciﬁed in Eq . 1 . The bending energy is discretized as described by Gompper and Kroll 51 – 53 . For each set of parameters , the system is initially thermalized . Ensemble averaging is done over 200 statistically independent microstates . In this work we set N c of the total N = 3127 vertices to rep - resent proteins and have spontaneous curvature c 0 = 1 / l min for curved proteins , unless stated otherwise , or c 0 = 0 for ﬂat pro - teins . All other vertices represent symmetric membrane and have zero spontaneous curvature . The positive sign of c 0 for curved proteins means that the proteins have the tendency to curve the membrane outwards . If the two vertices representing proteins are nearest neighbors , there is an addition energy term − w assigned to their bond ( direct protein - protein interaction ) . Direct interaction constant w is assumed to be of the order of the thermal energy kT 0 , where T 0 ≈ 300 K is “room temperature” , and membrane bending stiffness κ is of the order of 20 kT 0 . In the following we ﬁx the ratio κ / w = 20 , unless stated otherwise . For the size of the protrusive force F we expect the order of thermal energy kT 0 per minimal bond length l min . Note that since the volume of the vesicle is not conserved , it can adjust to accommodate any shape of the membrane , and therefore the membrane is in a tensionless regime for the passive system . The active forces , pointing outwards , induce a ﬁnite membrane stretch and tension . In addition , we can introduce a non - zero pres - sure difference across the membrane , which can act to inﬂate the vesicle and induce a ﬁnite tension ( Fig . S8 † ) . 3 Results and discussion Using our simulations we aim to improve the understanding of clustering of curved and active proteins on the membrane and how this process of demixing is coupled with membrane shape changes . Especially we are interested in the budding of curved protein clus - ters . We expect the demixing and budding to be enhanced by at - tractive direct interaction between the proteins and the additional membrane deformation induced by the protrusive ( cytoskeletal ) forces recruited by the proteins . In our Monte - Carlo simulations the whole membrane is the tri - angulated surface . To quantitatively analyse the demixing of the proteins in our system , we deﬁne the ensemble averaged mean cluster size as (cid:104) ¯ N vc (cid:105) = (cid:42) ∑ i N ( i ) vc N ( i ) cl ∑ i N ( i ) cl (cid:43) , ( 5 ) where the angle brackets denote the canonical ensemble average . Inside the brackets , i . e . for a given microstate , ¯ N vc is the mean clus - ter size and the sums run over all clusters of vertices representing proteins . In the sums , N ( i ) vc is the number of vertices in cluster i and N ( i ) cl is the number of clusters of size N ( i ) vc . 3 . 1 Phase transition in thermal equilibrium In Fig . 1 we plot the cluster size distribution and snapshots of typ - ical microstates of vesicles with curved proteins , in the absence of active protrusive forces . The system is in thermal equilibrium § at different temperatures and densities ( area coverage fraction , ρ = N c / N ) of curved proteins . At low average protein densities the equilibrium vesicle shapes remain quasi - spherical , with clusters that increase in size with de - creasing temperature ( in the far left column of Fig . 1 , the largest clusters are composed of 5 proteins at T / T 0 = 1 . 33 and of 8 pro - teins at T / T 0 = 0 . 63 ) . At higher average protein densities , cluster sizes increase and curved protein buds burst on the membrane . At even larger average protein densities , the vesicle shapes de - viate drastically from quasi - spherical and large necklace - like pro - tein clusters often form . The size of these necklace - like clusters and the number of “beads” they contain increase with decreas - § Note that in some cases , for example when large necklace - like clusters form , ther - mal equilibrium is not always easily obtainable . However , after monitoring different measures for membrane shape change and demixing , we expect that the presented results correspond to the correct phase behaviour . 2 ing temperature . These necklace - like structures form since the isotropically curved proteins can not form ﬂat aggregates , due to their spontaneous curvature , and resemble aggregates calcu - lated for membrane - adsorbed spherical particles 54 . The theory of self - assembly of curved proteins can approximately explain ob - served necklace - like structures ( see SI1 text † ) , while anisotropic curved proteins may form aggregates with other geometries on vesicles 55 , 56 . Necklace - like membrane protrusions have been ob - served in cellular membranes , under different conditions 57 , and in many in - vitro experiments 58 , 59 . We compare these simulation results with the prediction of the linear stability analysis ( corresponding to the spinodal ) of Glad - nikoff et al . 45 . The linear stability analysis yields the critical ther - mal energy , kT ( c ) , below which the instability occurs and buds start to form : ¶ kT ( c ) = 12 w ( 1 − ρ ) ρ   1 + (cid:115) l 2min Fc 0 12 w (cid:18) 1 − 1 ρ R 0 (cid:19) , ( 6 ) where 1 / R 0 is mean membrane curvature at the site of a curved membrane protein . In the following we approximate R 0 with the radius of a spherical vesicle with the same membrane area A (cid:107) . In thermal equilibrium , in the absence of the protrusive forces F = 0 , this simpliﬁes to : T ( c ) = 12 w ( 1 − ρ ) ρ / k , which is plotted in Fig . 1 . It can be seen that the prediction of the linear stability anal - ysis qualitatively agrees with our simulation results : above the crit - ical temperature line the protein budding is weak and the cluster size distribution is highly peaked at the size of isolated proteins , while below it buds are larger ( together with the corresponding membrane deformation ) and the size distribution exhibits a sec - ondary peak at aggregates containing 8 or more proteins ( which is the number required to form the smallest closed spherical clus - ter of proteins ) . For a more quantitative description , T ( c ) is deﬁned from the simulations as the temperature where (cid:104) ¯ N vc (cid:105) = 2 ( Eq . 5 ) ∗∗ , which agrees quite well with the predicted budding transition line , as plotted in Figs . 1 , 2a , b . We ﬁnd that the mean aggregate size ¶ We express the binding interaction between viral proteins J introduced in Glad - nikoff et al . 45 ( see the forth term in the expression for the membrane free energy , Eq . ( S1 ) , in its Supporting Material ) with our direct interaction constant w ( see Eq . 2 ) . We get that the aggregation interaction energy contribution per viral protein is J φ ( 1 − φ ) / 2 , where φ is the local concentration of viral proteins . Change of φ from 0 to 50 % gives an energy change of J / 8 . On the other hand in our simulations the energy contribution due to direct interaction between curved proteins is deﬁned on bonds between vertices , where each bond carries energy − w , if the vertices connected by the bond both represent curved proteins . In a hexagonal mesh the concentration φ = 1 / 2 for a given vertex corresponds the case where 3 out of 6 bonds carry the en - ergy − w and the energy per vertex is therefore − 3 w / 2 . Comparing the energy changes per protein when φ changes from 0 to 50 % in both models , we get J = − 12 w . We also identify φ 0 in 45 with our normalized average densities of curved proteins ρ = N c / N , H with one half of our spontaneous curvature c 0 and f c with our F per a 2 , where a is protein lateral size . We use a = l min and take into account that in our simulations we assume tensionless membrane ( σ = 0 ) . In our model the membrane is not ﬂat . For a membrane with curvature 1 / R 0 at the site of the curved protein , the spontaneous curvature c 0 ( or 2 H in Eq . ( S8 ) in the Supporting Material of 45 ) effectively changes to c 0 ( 1 − 1 / ρ R 0 ) . We can then express from Eq . ( S8 ) the critical temperature T ( c ) . (cid:107) To estimate R 0 we assume a network of equilateral triangles with sides of lengths l = ( l min + l max ) / 2 . This gives R 0 ≈ (cid:113) √ 3 l 2 N / 8 π ≈ 0 . 35 l min √ N . ∗∗ The points (cid:104) ¯ N vc (cid:105) as a function of temperature ( see Fig . 2b ) where ﬁtted using a function y ( x ) = a 1 / x a 2 + a 3 , where a 1 , a 2 and a 3 are free parameters and then y ( 2 ) was taken as the estimate for T ( c ) . For non - zero F only points at temperatures above the transition into a pancake - like shapes are taken into account when ﬁtting . The error bars in Fig . 2 were obtained by ﬁtting points (cid:104) ¯ N vc (cid:105)± ε , where ε ’s are standard deviations of (cid:104) ¯ N vc (cid:105) . collapses to a universal curve when the temperature is scaled by T ( c ) ( Fig . 2c ) . The agreement with Eq . 6 is also found as function of protein interaction strength ( Fig . 2d ) , and as function of vesicle radius ( Fig . S7 † ) . We conclude that the critical temperature for budding in the passive system agrees very well with the prediction of the linear stability model 45 ( Eq . 6 ) . The phase separation of the passive system was additionally approximated with a two - dimensional model of self - assembly of curved proteins ( see SI1 † for details ) . The total free energy of the model reads F = M [ ˜ x 1 ˜ µ 1 + kT ˜ x 1 ( ln ˜ x 1 − 1 ) ] + + M ∞ ∑ i = 1 (cid:104) x i µ i + kT x i i (cid:16) ln x i i − 1 (cid:17)(cid:105) − − µ M ( ˜ x 1 + ∞ ∑ i = 1 x i ) . ( 7 ) Here , ˜ x 1 and x i are the number densities of nanodomains in the weakly curved region and highly curved aggregates , respectively . The energy contributions come not only from the free energies per nanodomain ( µ i and ˜ µ 1 ) , but also from conﬁgurational entropy , while the Lagrange multiplier µ assures a constant number of nan - odomains in the system through a conservation relation . We min - imize F with respect to the number densities , arriving at the equi - librium distributions for aggregate size ( Eq . S10 † ) . This model predicts that the critical density beyond which the growth of ag - gregates is energetically favourable is given by ( Eq . S11 † ) ˜ x c ≈ exp (cid:18) ∆ f − w kT (cid:19) , ( 8 ) where ∆ f = f c − f sp is the difference between the energy of a single protein nanodomain on the highly curved necklace - like aggregates ( f c ) and on the weakly curved membrane region ( f sp ) . Compar - ison between the model phase transition and MC simulations of aggregate distributions shows good overall agreement , with large necklace - like aggregates appearing below the calculated transition line ( Fig . 1 ) . 3 . 2 Phase transitions in the presence of active protrusive forces Next , we consider the effects of active protrusive forces on the system . In Fig . 3 we plot the typical shapes and aggregate size distribution as in Fig . 1 , but with F = 1 kT 0 / l min . We can see that the active protrusive forces promote demixing and budding of the convex curved proteins , such that the transition temperature T ( c ) is shifted to higher temperatures and lower densities , as expected and predicted by the linear stability analysis 45 ( Eq . 6 ) . A more dramatic effect of the active forces is seen in Fig . 3 at low temperatures , where below the budding transition there is now a second transition to a new class of shapes that was not seen in the equilibrium system ( Fig . 1 ) . Namely , below the red dashed curve we ﬁnd that the vesicles change from deformed - spherical to ﬂat - tened pancake - like shapes , where all or nearly all the proteins ag - gregate at the rim , forming one large cluster in the form of a closed 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 0 . 6 0 . 65 0 . 7 0 . 75 0 . 8 0 . 85 0 . 9 0 . 95 1 1 . 05 1 . 1 1 . 15 1 . 2 1 . 25 1 . 3 1 . 35 1 . 4 ρ [ % ] T / T 0 Fig . 1 Microstates of the vesicles in thermal equilibrium ( absence of protrusive forces ) , for different average densities of curved proteins ρ and relative temperatures T / T 0 .

We locate the transition into the pancake - like shapes regime from the sharp change of the slope of the mean cluster size (cid:104) ¯ N vc (cid:105) as function of T ( see Fig . 4b , d ) , as shown in Figs . 3 , 4a , c . †† The transition is sharp ( see Fig . 5a ) , which suggests similarity to a ﬁrst - order phase transition ( although the system is out - of - equilibrium ) . However , we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant hysteresis ( Fig . S5 † ) . Note that in Fig . 4b we plot (cid:104) ¯ N vc (cid:105) as a function of T / T ( c ) , where T ( c ) is the critical temperature from Eq . 6 . In the presence of the actin protrusive force the curves collapse well at temperatures above the pancake - like shape transition , as in the passive case ( Figs . 2b , c ) . However , at lower temperatures , where this shape transition dominates the system behavior , there is no such collapse as function of T / T ( c ) . This is expected , since the linear analysis of Gladnikof et al . 45 does not take into account large - scale global shape changes , which are highly non - linear . A similar behavior is found for different protein - protein interaction strengths ( Fig . S4 † ) . As expected , a stronger force promotes the transition to pancake - like shapes at higher temperatures ( Fig . 4d ) . The organization of the proteins into a circular cluster around the rim of a ﬂat vesicle is highly effective in stretching out the ﬂat membrane parts . We indeed ﬁnd that these regions are almost devoid of proteins ( Figs . 3 , 5a ) , since these regions are energeti - cally unfavorable for the curved proteins . The stretching of the membrane in these regions also acts to suppress aggregation of the curved proteins 45 , and the rim aggregate is highly stable ( see Supporting Movie S1 † ) . Below a critical density , we ﬁnd that there are simply not enough proteins to form a continuous cluster around the rim of the ﬂat - tened vesicle , and the system changes to a different class of shapes ( Fig . 5a ) . In this regime the curved proteins form arc - like clusters that line the ﬂattened ends of an elongated vesicle , and remain highly dynamic ( see Supporting Movie S2 † ) . Since the curved pro - teins are isotropic , the curvature of the rim of the ﬂattened vesi - cles along circumferential direction is much smaller compared to c 0 . The curved protein therefore tend to bend the rim and cause it to undulate along this direction ( Fig . 5b ) . At large protein den - sities we ﬁnd that the excess proteins crowd the rim and cause it to undergo buckling and curling , so as to be able to accommodate more curved proteins ( Fig . 3 ) . At the highest densities , the excess proteins extend from the rim cluster as spherical and necklace - like clusters ( Fig . 3 ) . We can propose the following mechanism that drives the transi - tion from deformed spherical vesicles with small buds to pancake - shapes in the presence of the active protrusive forces . When the proteins are isolated , or in very small clusters , the membrane is rather ﬂat and the protrusive force promotes the aggregation of small clusters 45 , since the active force is directed at the outwards normal at each protein , thereby enhancing the outwards defor - mation that the curved protein induces . However , for larger clus - ters that are highly curved , the active forces point in different di - rections which acts to inﬂate and deform the clusters ( Fig . 6a ) . We can estimate the critical cluster size at which the in - plane †† The error bars on the pancake - transition curve in Fig . 4c mark the region in which the transition occurs , ı . e . the region between observed no - pancake states with lowest T and pancake states with largest T ( Fig . 3 ) . 5 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 0 . 6 0 . 65 0 . 7 0 . 75 0 . 8 0 . 85 0 . 9 0 . 95 1 1 . 05 1 . 1 1 . 15 1 . 2 1 . 25 1 . 3 1 . 35 1 . 4 ρ [ % ] T / T 0 Fig . 3 Same as on Fig . 1 but for the system with active protrusive forces F = 1 kT 0 / l min .

( b ) Schematic illustration of the forces when a ﬂat protein aggregate ( red ) drives the growth of a tubular protrusion from a ﬂat membrane . projection of the active forces are large enough to compete with the direct attraction between the proteins ( w ) , and can desta - bilize spherical aggregates . The cluster size for an angle θ is : N cl = 2 π c − 2 0 ( 1 − cos ( θ ) ) . The critical angle can be estimated by the following force balance : F sin ( θ ) (cid:39) w / l min . From this estimate we expect that the active forces will destabilize spherical aggre - gates above a critical cluster size . The observed transition line is indeed found to follow a critical cluster size contour ( Fig . 4a ) . As the temperature decreases and the mean cluster size increases beyond the critical size , the system transitions to another global conﬁguration where the proteins form a rim cluster that is highly stable and contains almost all the proteins . In this conﬁgurations there are no side - ways active forces that act to destabilize the pro - tein aggregate , but rather the active forces now act to stretch the whole vesicle in the same direction as the deformation due to the proteins’ curvature , and thereby stabilize the pancake conﬁgura - tion . 3 . 3 Dependence on the spontaneous curvature of the active proteins We next explore the role of the spontaneous curvature of the active proteins in driving the shape transition discussed above . We start by calculating the phase diagram for ﬂat active proteins , i . e . with c 0 = 0 . The result is shown in Fig . 7a . We ﬁnd that the budding transition line is still well described by the linear stability expres - sion ( Eq . 6 ) . At low temperatures we ﬁnd a global shape transition from quasi - spherical vesicles to shapes with highly elongated pro - trusions , which are driven by the protrusive force provided by a cluster of proteins at the protrusion’s tip . An approximate transi - tion curve , which marks the transition into such hydra - like shapes regime ( Fig . 7a , b ) can be obtained from locating the sharp change of the slope of the asphericity’s ‡‡ dependence on T ( Fig 7c ) . This shape transition can be understood by calculating the con - ‡‡ Deviation of the vesicle from quasi - spherical shapes can be characterized conve - niently in terms of the asphericity . To this end , we make use of the Gyration tensor , whose components are deﬁned for a discrete object through S ij = 1 N N ∑ k = 1 r k , i r k , j ( i , j = 1 , 2 , 3 ) . ( 9 ) ditions that allow a tube - like protrusion to start growing from the vesicle , driven by the protrusive force induced by a circular pro - tein aggregate ( Fig . 6b ) . This occurs when there is a force balance between the protrusive force provided by the protein cluster at the tip and the elastic restoring force due to membrane bending ( as in tether pulling ) : N cl F (cid:39) 2 πκ / √ N cl . From this force balance we derive the radius of the protrusions ( details in the SI † , Eq . S17 † ) : R c = (cid:0) 2 κ aF (cid:1) 1 / 3 ( where a is the average area per protein ) , which is in very good agreement with the simulated widths of the protru - sions ( Fig . S3 ) . As the temperature decreases , the mean cluster size increases until it is larger than the threshold size ( Fig . 6b ) for the elongation of tube - like protrusions ( Fig . 7b ) . In this phase the shapes are highly dynamic and unstable , with protrusions merging and growing ( see Supporting Movie S3 † ) . By ﬁxing a low temperature and large enough density , we ex - plore the dependence of the global vesicle shape transitions on the spontaneous curvature of the active proteins . This is shown in Fig . 7d , where we change the spontaneous curvature of the ac - tive proteins from c 0 = 0 ( ﬂat proteins ) to c 0 = 1 / l min ( the sponta - neous curvature used in the previous section ) . We ﬁnd that as c 0 is increased , the multi - tube - like shapes transform continuously into shapes that have a single tube - like part and ﬂattened arc - like clus - ters at the two tips . Above a critical spontaneous curvature there is a sharp transition into the ﬂattened shapes with continuous rim cluster . From our simple estimates ( Figs . 6a , b ) we predict that the critical cluster size that enables the pancake shape transition decreases with increasing c 0 , while the tube - like shape transition does not depend on this parameter . We therefore expect that above a critical value of c 0 the pancake shape will dominate , as we ob - serve ( Fig . 7d ) . 4 Conclusions We have explored here the coupling of convex proteins ( such as complexes that contain IRSp53 ) that recruit the protrusive force of the cytoskeleton ( most commonly due to actin polymerization ) , using Monte - Carlo computer simulations . We found that the pres - ence of the protrusive forces gives rise to the formation of protein aggregates and budding at a higher temperature and lower aver - age protein density , compared to the passive system that is in ther - mal equilibrium ( no active forces ) . This is in an agreement with analytic linear - stability analysis 45 . The more robust aggregation and budding due to the recruited active forces of the cytoskeleton has important consequences for a variety of biological processes , such as budding of viruses 45 , 46 , 65 and initiation of cellular protru - Here , r k , i is the i - th Cartesian coordinate of the position vector (cid:126) r k of the k - th particle . The origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of mass and the sum runs over all particles of the object . From the principal moments ( i . e . , the eigenvalues ) λ 1 ≥ λ 2 ≥ λ 3 of S ij ( calculated using the algorithm outlined by Smith 60 ) , we obtain the asphericity of the object 61 Asph = (cid:68) ( λ 1 − λ 3 ) 2 + ( λ 2 − λ 3 ) 2 + ( λ 1 − λ 2 ) 2 (cid:69) 2 (cid:68) ( λ 1 + λ 2 + λ 3 ) 2 (cid:69) ( 10 ) with (cid:104) . . . (cid:105) denoting ensemble averages . We point out that a one - dimensional object ( where λ 2 = λ 3 = 0 ) leads to A = 1 , a two - dimensional axisymmetric disk ( where λ 1 = λ 2 and λ 3 = 0 ) entails A = 1 / 4 , and a sphere ( where λ 1 = λ 2 = λ 3 ) gives rise to A = 0 . The asphericity A has frequently been used in the past to characterize polymers and membranes 62 – 64 . 8 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 ρ [ % ] T / T 0 ( a ) 6 8 10 12 14 16 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 1 . 1 1 . 2 2 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 6 . 0 8 . 0 10 . 0 12 . 0 14 . 0 1 6 . 0 18 . 0 20 . 0 ρ [ % ] T / T 0 ( b ) 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 T / T 0 A s ph ( c ) ρ = 11 % 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 100 200 300 c 0 × l min (cid:104) ¯ N v c (cid:105) ( d ) Fig . 7 ( a ) Same as Fig . 3 , but for ﬂat active proteins ( c 0 = 0 , F = 1 kT 0 / l min ) .

Some corresponding snapshots are shown , where colors of the arrows match the color of the corresponding data points . sions ( such as ﬁlopodia ) during development and cell motility . Beyond the budding transition , we found a new and unexpected global shape transition that occurs only in the presence of the ac - tive forces . In this transition the spherical vesicle is transformed into a ﬂat , pancake - like shape , with all the curved proteins and associated cytoskeleton forces along the circular rim . This struc - ture resembles the lamellipodia and rufﬂes of spreading and motile cells 66 ( see Supporting Movies S1 † and S2 † ) , where the actin poly - merization is localized to the highly curved leading edge . Our results show that lamellipodia - like structures spontaneously form when convex proteins recruit the protrusive force of the cytoskele - ton , on a closed membrane . Future studies could test these pre - dictions , by exploring the spontaneous curvature properties of the actin nucleators at the leading edges of these cellular structures . Let us note that ﬂat oblate membrane shapes can be obtained without the presence of active protrusive forces , for vesicles with low volume to area ratios 10 , 16 , 67 , 68 . However , in our simulations the volume of the vesicle is free to relax , and under such conditions we ﬁnd that the active forces are essential for the curved proteins to drive the global ﬂattened vesicle shape transition . In addition , a variety of tubular and ﬂattened shapes may be stabilized in the absence of active forces , due to the presence of anisotropic curved membrane proteins ( or protein complexes ) 69 . Tubular protrusions can occur due to accumulation of anisotropic membrane components , as was shown theoretically 21 , 28 , 29 , 29 , 70 – 73 and supported by experiments 9 , 21 , 24 . Vesicles with ﬂattened edges can be stabilized by anisotropic ( arc - like ) proteins that form a clus - ter at the edge of the ﬂattened regions 73 . We also note that the edge of the disc - shaped vesicles that we obtained here are highly convoluted ( Fig . 5b ) , due to the isotropic curvature of the pro - teins . Lamellipodia in cells may avoid this and maintain a smooth edge by using anisotropic proteins that recruit the actin polymer - ization . All of these considerations motivate the exploration of the vesicle shapes induced by coupling active forces with anisotropic membrane constituents in our future studies . To conclude , our study highlights the rich variety of membrane shapes that may be induced by curved membrane proteins that re - cruit the active forces of the cytoskeleton 30 . These include steady - state shapes that are not possible for the passive , equilibrium sys - tem . Future computer simulations could explore further the space of these non - equilibrium , and dynamic membrane shapes .

The curved nanodomains ( of total number N ) are initially distributed in the weakly curved spherical membrane surface of constant mean curvature H = 1 / R 0 . We assume that the nanodomains are laterally mobile over the membrane surface . For isotropic curved membrane protrusion of constant high mean curvature H = 1 / r . Here , r is the radius of curvature everywhere on the membrane protrusion which may be a sphere or necklace formation ( see Fig . S1 ) and assume R 0 > r . Fig . S1 Growth of necklace - like protrusions is energetically favorable when critical concentration ˜ x c is surpassed . For the sake of simplicity we assume that the free energy of a single ﬂexible membrane nanodomain can be written in the form [ V . Kralj - Igliˇc et al . Deviatoric elasticity as a possible physical mechanism explaining collapse of inorganic micro and nanotubes , Physics letters A , 2002 ] : f = ξ 2 ( H − H 0 ) 2 a o . ( S1 ) where H 0 is the intrinsic mean curvature of an isotropic membrane nanodomain , ξ is the elastic constant and a 0 is the area per single nanodomain . In aggregates of curved ﬂexible membrane nanodomains the local membrane bending constant is k c = ξ / 4 and the membrane spontaneous curvature c 0 = 2 H 0 . Curved ﬂexible membrane nanodomains in aggregates interact with neighbouring membrane nanodomains . We denote the corre - sponding interaction energy per curved ﬂexible membrane nanodomain ( monomer ) in an aggregate composed of i nanodomains as w ( i ) where we assume that the energy w ( i ) depends on the size of the aggregate composed of i nanodomains . The mean free energy per nanodomain in a curved aggregate ( where H = D = 1 / r ) composed of i nanodomains can be written as : µ i = f c − w ( i ) , ( S2 ) where f c = f ( H = 1 / r ) and w ( i ) > 0 . We assume that in the weakly curved spherical regions of the membrane ( having H = 1 / R 0 ) the concentration of nanodomains is always below the critical aggregation concentration and therefore nanodomains cannot form two - dimensional ﬂat aggregates . The mean energy per nanodomain in the weakly curved membrane regions is ˜ µ 1 = f sp , where f sp = f ( H = 1 / R o ) . The number density of curved proteins in the weakly curved membrane regions is ˜ x 1 = ˜ N 1 M , ( S3 ) where ˜ N 1 is the number of monomeric curved nanodomains in the weakly curved membrane regions and M is the number of lattice sites in the whole system . The distribution of highly curved aggregates in the membrane protrusions on the scale of number density is expressed as x i = iN i M , ( S4 ) where N i denotes the number of aggregates with aggregation number i . The number densities ˜ x 1 and x i must fulﬁl the conservation 12 condition for the total number of ﬂexible nanodomains in or on the membrane : ˜ x 1 + ∞ ∑ i = 1 x i = N / M . ( S5 ) The free energy F of all nanodomains in or on the membrane can be written as : F = M [ ˜ x 1 ˜ µ 1 + kT ˜ x 1 ( ln ˜ x 1 − 1 ) ] + M ∞ ∑ i = 1 (cid:104) x i µ i + kT x i i (cid:16) ln x i i − 1 (cid:17)(cid:105) − µ M ( ˜ x 1 + ∞ ∑ i = 1 x i ) , ( S6 ) where µ is the Lagrange parameter assuring conservation of protein concentrations . The above expression for the free energy also involves the contributions of conﬁgurational entropy . We minimize F with respect to ˜ x 1 and x i : ∂ F ∂ ˜ x i = 0 , ∂ F ∂ x i = 0 , i = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , ( S7 ) which leads to equilibrium distributions : ˜ x 1 = exp (cid:18) − f sp − µ kT (cid:19) , ( S8 ) x i = i exp (cid:18) − i kT [ f c − w − µ ] (cid:19) , ( S9 ) where we assumed for simplicity that w ( i ) = w is independent of aggregate size . The quantity µ can be expressed from Eq . S8 and substituted in Eq . S9 to get : x i = i (cid:20) ˜ x 1 · exp (cid:18) f sp + w − f c kT (cid:19)(cid:21) i . ( S10 ) We see that if the concentration ˜ x 1 is small , aggregate growth will not be favourable , since x 1 > x 2 > x 3 . . . . Furthermore , x i can never exceed unity , leading to the maximal possible value of the number density of monomeric curved ﬂexible nanodomains in the weakly curved parts of the membrane when ˜ x 1 approaches exp (cid:2) ( f c − f sp − w ) / kT (cid:3) . The critical concentration is therefore ˜ x c ≈ exp (cid:18) ∆ f − w kT (cid:19) , ( S11 ) where ∆ f = f c − f sp is the difference between the energy of a single nanodomain on the highly curved membrane protrusion and the energy of the single nanodomain in the weakly curved membrane region with : ∆ f = ξ a o 2 r (cid:18) 1 r − 2 H 0 (cid:19) − ξ a o 2 R 0 (cid:18) 1 R 0 − 2 H 0 (cid:19) . ( S12 ) If ˜ x 1 is above ˜ x c , the formation of a very long necklace membrane protrusions composed of curved membrane proteins is energetically favourable . It can be seen from Eq . S11 that longitudinal growth of the necklace membrane protrusions is dependent on the energy difference ∆ f ( Eq . S12 ) and the strength of the direct interaction between nanodomains w . The critical concentration ˜ x c strongly depends on H 0 . In the approximation limit R 0 (cid:29) r we can rewrite Eq . S12 as : ∆ f (cid:39) ξ 2 r (cid:18) 1 r − 2 H 0 (cid:19) = 2 k c r (cid:18) 1 r − c 0 (cid:19) , ( S13 ) where k c and c 0 are the local bending constant and spontaneous curvature of aggregates of nanodomains , respectively . We may rewrite Eq . S11 : ˜ x c ≈ exp (cid:18) 2 k c kT a o r 2 ( 1 − c 0 r ) − w kT (cid:19) . ( S14 ) For 1 < c 0 r the value of ∆ f is always negative . The theoretically predicted existence of necklace membrane protrusions ( without application of the local forces ) within the self - assembly theory is in line with our MC predictions . Since the density of nanodomains in or on the membrane is deﬁned with the conservation condition ( Eq . S5 ) , this also gives us the relation between normalized temperature T / T 0 and total curved nanodomains concentrations ρ = N / M . Using the parameters from the MC simulations , we may graph dependencies x i ( i ) , as seen in Fig . S2 . Above small concentrations and especially above ˜ x c , aggregates start to form , where the peaks of the distributions are strongly dependent on the total protein concentration in the lattice . We see that the critical line beyond which aggregate growth is favourable agrees well with the results of MC simulations . 13 ρ = 0 . 1 ρ = 0 . 2 ρ = 0 . 4 0 50 100 150 200 0 1 2 3 4 5 i x i ( · 10 - 3 ) Fig .

This is balanced by the restoring force of the membrane bending energy F b = κ 2 π R ( S16 ) with κ the bending modulus . The force balance gives the radius of the cylindrical protrusions in this phase of the vesicle shapes R c = (cid:18) 2 κ a F (cid:19) 1 / 3 ( S17 ) The prediction of Eq . S17 is in good agreement with simulations ( see Fig . S3 ) , where we took for a the area that correspons to one vertex in a hexagonal mesh , a = √ 3 l 20 / 2 , where l 0 = ( l min + l max ) / 2 . In the phase of tubular shapes , there are several protrusions ( typically 2 - 3 ) that pull in opposite directions to provide an overall force balance , and maintain the relative stability of this shape . Some fusions of protrusions do occur , especially for cases with a larger number of thinner protrusions , so that their number ﬂuctuates . 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 2 4 6 κ / F × l min R c Fig .

Without the active protrusive force , (cid:104) ¯ N vc (cid:105) monotonically increases with ρ and decreases with T , while the protrusive force gives rise to the sharp transition into pancake - like shapes . The lower stability of the rim aggregate at high protein densities , that we already noticed in Fig . 3 , is manifested in the non - monotonic dependencies of (cid:104) ¯ N vc (cid:105) on ρ and T ( Fig .
