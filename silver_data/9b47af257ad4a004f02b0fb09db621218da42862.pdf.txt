AFM cantilevers with blunted pyramidal tips are commonly used to obtain images of living cells . Measurement of mechanical properties with these tips requires a contact model that takes into account their blunted geometry . The aim of this work was to develop a contact model of a blunted pyramidal tip and to assess the suitability of pyramidal tips for probing mechani - cal properties of soft gels and living cells . We developed a contact model of a blunted pyramidal tip indenting an elastic half - space . We measured Young’s modulus (cid:1) E (cid:2) and the complex shear modulus (cid:1) G * = G (cid:1) + i G (cid:2) (cid:2) of agarose gels and A549 alveolar epithelial cells with pyramidal tips and compared them with those obtained with spherical tips . The gels exhibited an elastic behavior with almost coincident loading and unloading force curves and negligible values of G (cid:2) . E fell sharply with indentation up to (cid:3) 300 nm , showing a linear regime for deeper indentations . A similar indentation dependence of E with twofold lower values at the linear regime was obtained with the spherical tip ﬁtted with Hertz’s model . The dependence of E on indentation in cells paralleled that found in gels . Cells exhibited viscoelastic behavior with G (cid:2) / G (cid:1) (cid:3) 1 / 4 . Pyramidal tips commonly used for AFM imaging are suitable for probing mechanical properties of soft gels and living cells .

INTRODUCTION The mechanical properties of the cell play a key role in determining cell shape and changes during essential func - tions such as contraction , crawling , and migration . Micros - copy and nanomanipulation techniques have led to a dra - matic increase in our knowledge of the morphology and mechanical properties of cells . One of the most powerful tools is atomic force microscopy (cid:1) AFM (cid:2) , which allows us to obtain topographical images and to probe mechanical prop - erties of living cells under physiological conditions (cid:4) 1 (cid:5) . Moreover , AFM can be used to monitor dynamic changes in the shape and mechanics of the cell during pharmacological treatments . AFM uses a ﬂexible cantilever with a sharp tip at its end to probe the sample surface . Images are obtained by scanning the surface of the sample with the cantilever tip . The sharp - ness of the tip , apart from other characteristics such as sample stiffness , determines image resolution (cid:4) 2 (cid:5) . Soft sili - cone nitride AFM cantilevers with pyramidal tips are com - monly used for obtaining high - resolution images of living cells (cid:4) 3 , 4 (cid:5) . Pyramidal tips are blunted or rounded at the apex . Despite their bluntness , they are sharp enough to resolve subcellular structures of living cells , such as the cytoskel - eton , which plays the main role in cellular mechanics (cid:4) 5 – 10 (cid:5) . The cell mechanics are probed with AFM by indenting the surface of the cell with the tip of the cantilever and measur - ing the force - indentation (cid:1) F - (cid:1) (cid:2) relationship . The mechanical parameters of the sample are usually estimated by ﬁtting F - (cid:1) data with a suitable contact model , taking into account the geometry of the probe . Hertz’s theory (cid:4) 11 (cid:5) is the most common approach to analyzing contact mechanics . This ap - proach is based on inﬁnitesimal strains and assumes linear elastic , isotropic , axisymmetric , perfectly smooth , and semi - inﬁnite bodies in contact with each other over a small region of their surface (cid:4) 11 (cid:5) . In particular , Hertz’s theory leads to analytical solutions for spherical and conical tips indenting an elastic half - space (cid:4) 12 (cid:5) . Assuming a spherical geometry of the tip apex , the spherical Hertz model has been applied to pyramidal tips to determine the mechanical properties of biopolymer gels and living cells (cid:4) 13 – 15 (cid:5) . This model fails for indentations larger than the apparent radius of curvature of the tip (cid:1) 10 – 50 nm (cid:2) . For deep indentations , pyramidal tips have been modeled as cones (cid:4) 13 , 16 (cid:5) . A blunted cone model has been developed for a wider range of indentations (cid:4) 17 , 18 (cid:5) . However , the actual geometry of pyramidal tips is not a blunted cone but a blunted pyramid . A contact model for an ideal pyramid has been numerically developed by Bilodeau (cid:4) 19 (cid:5) . This pyramidal model has recently been used to probe the mechanical properties of living cells at deep indentations (cid:4) 20 (cid:5) . To the best of our knowledge , a more detailed pyrami - dal contact model , taking into account the blunt geometry of conventional AFM pyramidal tips , has not been developed . The use of a cantilever with a microsphere attached at its end has recently been proposed to indent a sample with a simple contact geometry and to minimize strain (cid:4) 21 , 22 (cid:5) . Cantilevers with microspheres ranging (cid:3) 1 to (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) m in diameter have been used to probe biopolymer gels and living cells (cid:4) 21 – 24 (cid:5) . Sample mechanical properties were estimated by ﬁtting indentation data with the Hertz spherical model . Although a microsphere provides a simple contact geometry for probing mechanics , the use of this tip yields low - * Corresponding author .

Replacing the cantilever between im - aging and mechanical measurements is difﬁcult and time consuming . This may be suitable for large , stable , and uni - form samples but not for living cells , since they have a com - plex shape and exhibit heterogeneous and time - varying me - chanical properties . Moreover , the mechanics and shape of the cell change during spontaneous contraction and locomo - tion and in response to pharmacological stimuli . The use of a single cantilever for imaging and indentation enables us to precisely correlate the shape and mechanics of living cells . Pyramidal tips commonly used for AFM imaging could be suitable for probing cell mechanics . Moreover , measure - ments at low indentations could be improved by developing a blunted pyramidal model that takes into account the blunted geometry of the tip . The aim of this work was to develop a contact model of a blunted pyramidal tip and to assess the suitability of AFM pyramidal tips for probing mechanical properties of soft biopolymer gels and living cells . We ﬁrst developed a con - tact model of a blunted regular pyramid indenting an elastic half - space . We probed soft samples of agarose gels and liv - ing human alveolar epithelial cells with pyramidal and spherical tips using the blunted pyramidal model and the spherical Hertz model , respectively . The Young’s modulus (cid:1) E (cid:2) and the complex shear modulus (cid:4) G * (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2)(cid:5) estimated with the pyramidal and spherical tips were compared . II . THEORY Contact model of a blunted pyramid indenting an elastic half - space The force - indentation relationship , F (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:2) , for a blunted n - sided rigid regular pyramid of semi - included angle (cid:4) , tip defect h , and spherical cap radius R c (cid:1) Fig . 1 (cid:2) was derived using Betti’s reciprocal theorem (cid:4) 26 (cid:5) . Accordingly , the total force F applied by a tip with an arbitrary shape and projected area A was computed from the pressure distribution of a ﬂat indenter (cid:4) p * (cid:1) r , (cid:5) (cid:2)(cid:5) of plan form A F = (cid:6) (cid:6) A p * (cid:1) r , (cid:5) (cid:2) f (cid:1) r , (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:1) * r dr d (cid:5) , (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) where (cid:1) * is the indentation depth for the ﬂat indenter , and f (cid:1) r , (cid:5) (cid:2) is the interpenetration function for the tip . The ana - lytical form of p * (cid:1) r , (cid:5) (cid:2) is known only for elliptical contact areas . Thus , only in this case can a closed - form solution of Eq . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) be obtained . Nevertheless , p * (cid:1) r , (cid:5) (cid:2) and therefore F can be approximated in the Rayleigh - Ritz sense , i . e . , by us - ing the best elliptical approximation to the actual contact area (cid:4) 27 (cid:5) . For a regular n - sided pyramid , the cross section at any indentation depth is a regular n - sided polygon . Therefore , its best elliptical approximation is a circle of radius a centered on the axis of the pyramid , and the pressure distribution of the corresponding ﬂat indenter is that of a cylindrical punch of radius a p * (cid:1) r , (cid:5) (cid:2) = E (cid:6) (cid:1) 1 − (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) (cid:1) * (cid:1) a 2 − r 2 (cid:2) 1 / 2 . (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) Substituting this expression into Eq . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) , we obtain F = E (cid:6) (cid:1) 1 − (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) (cid:6) (cid:6) A f (cid:1) r , (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:1) a 2 − r 2 (cid:2) 1 / 2 r dr d (cid:5) , (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) where E is Young’s modulus , and (cid:7) is Poisson’s ratio . The blunted pyramid was modeled as a spherical cap that transforms smoothly into an n - sided pyramid (cid:1) Fig . 1 (cid:2) accord - ing to the following interpenetration function : f (cid:1) r (cid:2) = (cid:1) − r 2 2 R c 0 (cid:8) a (cid:9) b , f (cid:1) r , (cid:5) (cid:2) = (cid:1) − r − b tan (cid:4) cos (cid:7) (cid:5) − 2 k (cid:6) n (cid:8) − h * , (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) a (cid:10) b , (cid:1) 2 k − 1 (cid:2) (cid:6) n (cid:9) (cid:5)(cid:9) (cid:1) 2 k + 1 (cid:2) (cid:6) n , k = 0 , 1 , . . . , n − 1 , where b is the radial distance corresponding to the transition from spherical cap to pyramidal faces and h * = b 2 / (cid:1) 2 R c (cid:2) .

III . MATERIALS AND METHODS A . Atomic force microscopy Measurements were carried out with an AFM (cid:1) Bioscope , Digital Instruments , Santa Barbara , CA , USA (cid:2) , mounted on an inverted optical microscope (cid:1) IX70 , Olympus Optical Co . , Tokyo , Japan (cid:2) . V - shaped Au - coated silicon nitride cantilevers with nominal spring constant k = 10 mN / m with a regular four - sided pyramidal tip of nominal semi - included angle (cid:4) = 35° (cid:1) Microlevers , Thermomicroscopes , Sunnyvale , CA , USA (cid:2) , and similar cantilevers with a spherical polystyrene bead with nominal diameter of 5 (cid:2) m glued at their end (cid:1) NovaScan Technologies , Ames , Iowa , USA (cid:2) were used as AFM probes . One pair of pyramidal and spherical cantilevers was used for probing agarose gels , and another pair for prob - ing cells . The cantilevers were cleaned before each set of measurements , using piranha solution (cid:1) 70 % H 2 SO 4 , 30 % H 2 O 2 (cid:2) for the pyramidal tips and ethanol for the spherical ones . Scanning electron microscopy (cid:1) SEM , Zeiss DSM 940 - A , Zeiss , Göttingen , Germany (cid:2) images of the cantilevers were obtained after measurements to determine the actual tip geometries . B . Calibration of cantilever spring constants The spring constants of the cantilevers were determined by the thermal ﬂuctuations method (cid:4) 28 (cid:5) . Brieﬂy , the cantile - ver was modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator . According to the equipartition theorem , each averaged quadratic term of the Hamiltonian of the system is given by k B T / 2 , where k B is the Boltzmann constant , and T is the absolute temperature . Three seconds of cantilever thermal ﬂuctuations were re - corded in air away from any surface at room temperature . Data were ﬁltered with an antialiasing ﬁlter (cid:1) Butterworth , 106 kHz , 8 poles (cid:2) and sampled at 500 kHz by a computer interface board (cid:1) PCI - MIO - 16E - 4 , National Instruments , Aus - tin , TX , USA (cid:2) . The power spectrum of ﬂuctuation recordings was computed by fast Fourier transform (cid:1) FFT (cid:2) . The ﬁrst resonant peak was ﬁtted with a Lorentzian curve plus an offset to reject contributions other than the ﬁrst oscillation mode due to white noise . The mean square of ﬂuctuations was computed as the area under the curve (cid:1) P (cid:2) . Invoking the Parseval theorem , the spring constant was computed as k = ck B T / P , where c is a correction factor c = 0 . 76 for the ﬁrst vibration mode of a V - shaped cantilever (cid:4) 29 (cid:5) . C . Agarose gel preparation Puriﬁed agarose (cid:1) Type I - A : Low EEO , A - 0169 , Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA (cid:2) of 0 . 3 % w / v in Millipore RX water was boiled for (cid:3) 20 min , stirring continuously . The agarose solu - tion was poured into a 35 - mm - diam Petri dish to obtain a gel thickness of (cid:3) 500 (cid:2) m . A small region of the Petri dish was left bare to allow calibration of the AFM photodiode . After gelation of the solution occurs (cid:1)(cid:3) 5 min (cid:2) , the sample was covered with 2 ml of Millipore RX water and stored at 4 °C . D . Cell culture Cell measurements were carried out in living human al - veolar epithelial cells , line A549 (cid:1) CCL - 185 , ATCC , Manas - sas , VA , USA (cid:2) . The culture medium consisted of HEPES (cid:1) Sigma Chemical , St . Louis , Missouri (cid:2) buffered RPMI 1640 with 10 % inactivated fetal calf serum (cid:1) Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beit Haemek , Israel (cid:2) , 1 mM L - glutamine , 100 U / ml PROBING MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF LIVING … PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72 , 021914 (cid:1) 2005 (cid:2) 021914 - 3 penicillin , 100 mg / ml streptomycin (cid:1) GIBCO , Gaithersburg , MD , USA (cid:2) , and 2 mg / ml amphotericin B (cid:1) Bristol - Myers Squibb Co . , New Brunswick , NJ , USA (cid:2) . The cells were in - cubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Two days before the experi - ments , the cells were trypsinized and plated on 10 - mm - diam glass coverslips . The culture medium used during experi - ments was serum free . E . Measurements A Petri dish with agarose gel was placed on the temperature - controlled stage (cid:1) Lake Shore Cryotronics , West - erville , OH , USA (cid:2) of the AFM at 26 °C and stabilized for (cid:3) 30 min with the cantilever immersed in liquid . The AFM photodiode was calibrated by recording three force curves in the bare region of the Petri dish using a deﬂection range (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) m (cid:1) F (cid:13) 10 nN (cid:2) . Ten deﬂection - distance (cid:1) d - z (cid:2) curves (cid:1) triangular oscillations at 0 . 3 Hz of 3 (cid:2) m peak - to - peak am - plitude (cid:2) were recorded (cid:1) 2048 points / cycle (cid:2) in three different regions of each gel . The cantilever was approached until reaching a maximum indentation (cid:3) 2 (cid:2) m and (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) m for the pyramidal and spherical tips , respectively . After the last d - z measurement , low - amplitude triangular oscillations (cid:1) 100 nm peak - to - peak , 0 . 3 Hz (cid:2) were applied at an operating indentation of (cid:3) 500 nm , and ﬁve cycles were recorded at 128 points / cycle . Measurements were carried out on seven agarose gel samples . Each sample was probed with both py - ramidal and spherical tips in random order . A similar protocol of measurements was taken on seven A549 cells from different cultured coverslips . Each cell was probed randomly with both tips at three points of the central region of the cell surface . Force curves were recorded with a maximum indentation of (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) m . Five low - amplitude oscil - latory cycles were also recorded in one of the three regions of the cell at an operating indentation of (cid:3) 500 nm . The ex - perimental protocol lasted (cid:3) 45 min . Contact mode images were acquired after mechanical measurements in three cells with the pyramidal tip at 1 Hz and force set point (cid:9) 0 . 5 nN . F . Data processing Each experimental d - z curve obtained with the pyramidal tip was ﬁtted with the blunted pyramid model (cid:4) Eqs . (cid:1) 8 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 9 (cid:2)(cid:5) expressed in terms of the displacement of the piezo (cid:1) z (cid:2) and the deﬂection of the cantilever (cid:1) d (cid:2) , using F = k (cid:1) d − d off (cid:2) , (cid:1) 11 (cid:2) and (cid:1) = z − z c − (cid:1) d − d off (cid:2) , (cid:1) 12 (cid:2) where k is the spring constant of the cantilever , d off is the deﬂection offset , and z c is the point of contact . Substituting Eqs . (cid:1) 11 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 12 (cid:2) into Eqs . (cid:1) 8 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) , we obtained d = d off + 2 E k (cid:1) 1 − (cid:7) 2 (cid:2) (cid:11) (cid:4) z − z c − (cid:1) d − d off (cid:2)(cid:5) a − 2 1 / 2 a 2 (cid:6) tan (cid:4) (cid:12) (cid:7) (cid:6) 2 − arcsin b a (cid:8) − a 3 3 R c + (cid:1) a 2 − b 2 (cid:2) 1 / 2 (cid:12) (cid:7) 2 1 / 2 (cid:6) b tan (cid:4) + a 2 − b 2 3 R c (cid:8) (cid:12) , (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) z − z c − (cid:1) d − d off (cid:2) − a tan (cid:4) 2 3 / 2 (cid:6) (cid:9) (cid:6) 2 − arcsin (cid:7) b a (cid:8) (cid:10) + a R c (cid:12) (cid:4)(cid:1) a 2 − b 2 (cid:2) 1 / 2 − a (cid:5) = 0 . (cid:1) 14 (cid:2) Since there is no analytical solution for Eq . (cid:1) 14 (cid:2) , the radius of contact a was computed numerically using an interpola - tion routine . The pyramidal tip data were also ﬁtted with the ideal py - ramidal tip model (cid:4) Eq .

A nonlinear least - squares ﬁt (cid:1) Mat - lab 6 . 5 , The MathWorks , Inc . , Natick , MA , USA (cid:2) was used to estimate E , z c , and d off from each loading d - z curve . The ﬁt included a clear noncontact region . For cell measure - ments , the ﬁrst (cid:2) m of the noncontact region was discarded . The average E for each sample was computed using the last three curves at the three measurement points . The mean and standard deviation (cid:1) SD (cid:2) of these values were computed . To assess the dependence of E on indentation , contact model equations (cid:4) Eqs . (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) , (cid:1) 15 (cid:2) , and (cid:1) 16 (cid:2)(cid:5) were solved for E . E was computed from each force - indentation measurement point , using the values of z c and d off ﬁtted with the d - z curve . E was computed at equally spaced indentation intervals by interpolation to allow averaging . For low - amplitude oscillations around an operating inden - tation (cid:1) (cid:1) 0 (cid:2) , Eq . (cid:1) 8 (cid:2) can be approximated taking the ﬁrst two terms of the Taylor expansion (cid:4) 20 , 21 (cid:5) . Using G = E / (cid:4) 2 (cid:1) 1 + v (cid:2)(cid:5) and transforming to the frequency domain , G * (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) for a blunted pyramidal tip is G * (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) = 1 − (cid:7) 4 a 0 F (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) , (cid:1) 17 (cid:2) where F (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) and (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) are the Fourier transforms of force and indentation , respectively , (cid:3) is the angular frequency (cid:1) (cid:3) = 2 (cid:6) f (cid:2) , and a 0 is the contact radius at (cid:1) 0 .

Cantilever tips From the SEM images of the tips used in agarose (cid:1) Fig . 2 (cid:2) , we estimated a semi - included angle of (cid:4) = 35 . 5° for the py - ramidal tip and a bead radius of R = 2 . 4 (cid:2) m for the spherical tip . We estimated (cid:4) = 35 . 4° and R = 2 . 5 (cid:2) m for the tips used on A549 cells . The pyramidal tips exhibited a blunted apex (cid:1) Fig . 2 (cid:2) . We modeled the actual tip geometry using the blunted pyramid model (cid:1) tip defect h = 100 nm (cid:2) with the spherical cap merging tangential with the pyramid faces . B . Agarose gels The pyramidal and spherical tip cantilevers used on aga - rose gels had spring constants of k = 7 . 1±0 . 6 mN / m and k = 7 . 9±0 . 6 mN / m , respectively . Representative examples of d - z curves taken on agarose are shown in Fig . 3 . The loading and unloading curves were almost coincident . The ﬁt of the model to the loading curve was excellent for both the pyra - midal (cid:4) r 2 = 0 . 9994±0 . 0003 , root - mean - square error (cid:1) rms (cid:2) = 4 . 46±3 . 06 nm (cid:5) and spherical (cid:1) r 2 = 0 . 9991±0 . 0002 , rms = 2 . 55±1 . 48 nm (cid:2) tips . The residual error plot (cid:1) Fig . 3 (cid:2) showed only minor deviations from the models . Nevertheless , the models slightly underestimated the force in the vicinity of the contact point . The value of E computed with the pyramidal tip (cid:1) 1 . 38±1 . 36 kPa (cid:2) was larger than that computed with the spherical one (cid:1) 0 . 72±0 . 60 kPa , p (cid:11) 0 . 05 (cid:2) . We found a small coefﬁcient of variation (cid:1) CoV (cid:2) of E obtained from consecu - tive curves acquired at the same point of the gel with the pyramidal (cid:1) 3 . 9±2 . 4 % (cid:2) and spherical (cid:1) 2 . 7±1 . 8 % (cid:2) tips . Larger variability for the pyramid (cid:1) 10 . 9±10 . 5 % (cid:2) and the sphere (cid:1) 13 . 6±4 . 9 % (cid:2) were found from measurements taken at different points of the same gel . E computed from the spherical tip exhibited a sharp fall at low indentations , reaching a plateau at (cid:3) 200 nm (cid:1) Fig . 4 (cid:2) . A similar indentation dependence was obtained with a plateau above (cid:3) 300 nm with the pyramidal tip using the blunted model (cid:4) Eqs . (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 14 (cid:2)(cid:5) . When employing the ideal pyra - midal model (cid:4) Eq . (cid:1) 15 (cid:2)(cid:5) , the plateau was shifted to slightly higher indentations (cid:1)(cid:3) 400 nm (cid:2) .

Alveolar epithelial cells The cantilevers used on A549 cells had spring constants of k = 6 . 3±0 . 4 mN / m and k = 7 . 9±0 . 6 mN / m for the pyrami - dal and spherical tips , respectively . The thickness of the cells in the probed regions was 5 – 6 (cid:2) m , and the d - z curves of the cells exhibited considerable hysteresis (cid:1) Fig . 5 (cid:2) . We fre - quently observed deﬂection values below d off in the unload - ing curves , indicating cell - tip adhesion . The contact models ﬁtted loading d - z curves very well for the pyramidal (cid:4) Eqs .

Repeated measurements obtained at the same point of the cell led to similar CoV for the pyra - mid (cid:1) 5 . 3±3 . 8 % (cid:2) and the sphere (cid:1) 3 . 1±2 . 8 % (cid:2) . In contrast , the variability computed from different regions within the same cell rose to 41 . 9±21 . 5 % (cid:1) pyramid (cid:2) and to 25 . 9±22 . 7 % (cid:1) sphere (cid:2) . Young’s modulus of cells showed an indentation dependence similar to that of gels (cid:1) Fig . 6 (cid:2) , reaching the pla - teau at comparable indentation depths .

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72 , 021914 (cid:1) 2005 (cid:2) 021914 - 6 V . DISCUSSION We have developed a contact model to describe the force - indentation relationship of a blunted pyramid indenting an elastic half - space . The model was extended for application to viscoelastic samples subjected to small - amplitude oscilla - tions . Soft agarose gels probed with AFM blunted pyramidal tips showed a fall in E at low indentations , reaching a con - stant value for depths larger than (cid:3) 300 nm . A similar inden - tation dependence of E was observed when the gels were probed with the spherical tip . Nevertheless , E and G (cid:1) mea - sured at deep indentations with the sphere were twofold lower than those found with the pyramid . The gels exhibited an elastic behavior with almost coincident loading and un - loading force curves and negligible values of G (cid:2) . The depen - dence of E on indentation in cells paralleled that found in the gels . Cells exhibited viscoelastic behavior with a G (cid:2) / G (cid:1) ratio (cid:3) 1 / 4 . The mathematical approach used to develop the blunted pyramidal model was based on Betti’s reciprocal theorem and the Rayleigh - Ritz approximation (cid:4) 26 (cid:5) . The Betti recip - rocal theorem allowed us to relate the total force applied by the pyramidal tip to the pressure distribution of a ﬂat tip with the same contact area (cid:4) Eq . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2)(cid:5) . Since this equation cannot be solved analytically , we made use of the Rayleigh - Ritz ap - proach in determining the best elliptical approximation to the actual contact area . This approximation is useful when the main interest is to compute F (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:2) and not the pressure distri - bution , which requires a more complex mathematical devel - opment . Barber and Billings used this procedure to obtain the F (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:2) of an ideal three - sided pyramidal tip (cid:4) 27 (cid:5) . Their solution differed by only 13 % when compared with numeri - cal computations . Given that the intervals of integration de - crease with the number of sides , a lower error for a four - sided pyramid was estimated . In fact , the solution we found for an ideal four - sided pyramid (cid:4) Eq . (cid:1) 10 (cid:2)(cid:5) agrees within 6 % with the equation derived by Bilodeau based on the stress distribution of a cone modiﬁed by the singularities at the lateral edges of the pyramid (cid:4) 19 (cid:5) . By imposing a smooth transition from the spherical cap to the pyramid faces , the faces must be slightly curved near the cap . This curvature leads to a smaller cross - sectional area compared with that of ﬂat faces (cid:1) Fig . 1 (cid:2) . At an indentation of (cid:3) 300 nm (cid:1) (cid:4) = 35° , R c = 100 nm (cid:2) , the difference between the ﬂat and curved surfaces is (cid:3) 8 % and tends to zero at deeper indenta - tions . Assuming that the force is proportional to the area , we estimate a similar difference in E . The blunted pyramidal model matches the spherical model with a radius equal to that of the spherical cap (cid:1) R = R c (cid:2) for indentations where the sample only contacts the spherical cap (cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:9) 2 h * (cid:2) , and at deeper indentations , the blunted pyramidal model approaches the ideal pyramidal model smoothly (cid:1) Fig . 7 (cid:2) . Note that the n - sided blunted pyra - midal model (cid:4) Eqs . (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 7 (cid:2)(cid:5) is easily solvable for the variety of pyramidal geometries commercially available . The semi - included angle measured by SEM was in very good FIG . 6 .

Solid line is the blunted pyramidal model with semi - included angle (cid:4) = 35° and a spherical cap of ra - dius R c = 100 nm merging tangential with the faces . Dotted line is the ideal pyramidal model with (cid:4) = 35° (cid:1) slope = 2 (cid:2) . Dashed line is the spherical model of radius R = 100 nm (cid:1) slope = 3 / 2 (cid:2) . Dashed - dotted line is the spherical model with R = 2500 nm (cid:1) slope = 3 / 2 (cid:2) . The blunted pyramidal model matches the spherical model of R = 100 nm (cid:1) R c = R (cid:2) for indentations smaller than 80 nm (cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:9) 2 h * (cid:2) and approaches the ideal pyramidal model for deeper indentations . The difference is (cid:9) 15 % for indentations deeper than 1000 nm . PROBING MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF LIVING … PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72 , 021914 (cid:1) 2005 (cid:2) 021914 - 7 agreement with its nominal value (cid:1) 35° (cid:2) . This was expected from the stability of the fabrication process (cid:4) 31 (cid:5) and suggests that the nominal (cid:4) could be used to compute the blunted pyramidal model . However , the radius of the spherical cap measured by SEM (cid:1) R c = 123 nm (cid:2) was twofold larger than its nominal value (cid:1)(cid:3) 50 nm (cid:2) . Using the nominal radius would overestimate E by (cid:3) 65 % for low indentations (cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:9) 2 h * (cid:2) . The difference would tend to zero for deeper indentations , being (cid:9) 1 % for (cid:1)(cid:11) 1 (cid:2) m . Thus , accurate measurements at low in - dentations with a blunted pyramidal tip would require pre - cise characterization of tip bluntness . It should also be pointed out that the solution for an n - sided blunted pyramid (cid:4) Eqs . (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 7 (cid:2)(cid:5) tends to that of a blunted cone when n → (cid:14) (cid:4) 17 (cid:5) . When , in addition , b → 0 , the solution corresponds to that of an ideal cone (cid:4) 32 (cid:5) . AFM systems tilt the cantilever by 10° – 20° so that the beams of the cantilever do not touch the sample . Heim and co - workers studied the contribution of the inclination angle (cid:1) (cid:15) (cid:2) to the deﬂection of the cantilever and suggested a cor - rection factor (cid:4) 33 (cid:5) . Given the cantilever and tip dimensions that we used (cid:1) 320 (cid:2) m cantilever length , 4 – 5 (cid:2) m tip height and 12° tilt (cid:2) , Heim’s correction factors were (cid:9) 0 . 5 % for both the spherical and pyramidal tips and were thus neglected . Moreover , current contact models assume normal indentation of the tip on the sample surface . Costa and Yin (cid:4) 34 (cid:5) dis - cussed the effect of tip inclination on F (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:2) for an ideal cone . They suggested that the F (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:2) of a tilted conical tip lies be - tween the responses for semi - included angles (cid:4) + (cid:15) and (cid:4) − (cid:15) . The force of a regular pyramid in normal indentation is the addition of the force applied to each face . We assume that the total force of a tilted pyramid is composed of the contri - butions of each face , weighted by the areas of their cross sections . In addition , we consider that each face of the tilted pyramid follows the F (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:2) of an ideal pyramid (cid:4) Eq . (cid:1) 10 (cid:2)(cid:5) with semi - included angle (cid:4) ± (cid:15) (cid:1) faces parallel to the inclination axis (cid:2) or (cid:4) (cid:1) faces perpendicular to the inclination axis (cid:2) . From this approach , we estimate an apparent increase in E of (cid:3) 10 % when tilting an ideal four - sided pyramid (cid:1) (cid:4) = 35° (cid:2) by 12° . Assuming a similar behavior for the blunted pyramidal model , our measurements taken with the tilted pyramidal tip overestimated E by (cid:3) 10 % . Reliable estimation of mechanical parameters from d - z curves requires accurate determination of the contact point (cid:4) 21 , 35 , 36 (cid:5) . In general , the contact point is visually deﬁned at the point where cantilever deﬂection starts to rise . However , visual determination of the contact point is especially difﬁ - cult in soft samples that exhibit a smooth increase in canti - lever deﬂection at low indentations (cid:1) Figs . 3 and 5 (cid:2) . To deﬁne the contact point with an objective procedure , we simulta - neously estimated E and the location of the contact point (cid:1) z c , d off (cid:2) by ﬁtting d - z curves that included a noncontact re - gion . The ﬁtting was carried out in the approaching curve to avoid the adhesion events observed in the retraction curves , especially in cells (cid:1) Fig . 5 (cid:2) . The quality of the ﬁt with the two tips was excellent in gels and cells . It should be noted , how - ever , that both models slightly underestimated cantilever de - ﬂection in the vicinity of the contact point (cid:1) Figs . 3 and 5 (cid:2) . We ﬁrst assessed the suitability of AFM pyramidal tips for probing mechanics in soft agarose gels . We used agarose gels as a reference sample since different techniques have shown that their mechanical properties are elastic , linear , homoge - neous , and isotropic (cid:4) 25 , 37 (cid:5) . Moreover , we made the gel samples (cid:3) 500 (cid:2) m thick to avoid the effect of the hard sub - strate . These features are required to fulﬁll the assumptions used to derive tip contact models . The high repeatability of E computed from consecutive curves recorded at the same point (cid:1) CoV (cid:9) 4 % (cid:2) indicates stability of the sample and ab - sence of permanent deformation . The homogeneity of the gel was reﬂected in the low variation of E among different points of the sample (cid:1) CoV (cid:9) 10 % (cid:2) . The near coincidence of the approach and retraction d - z curves conﬁrmed the elastic behavior of our gel samples . Measurement of the complex shear modulus allows us to assess the frequency - domain ex - pansion of the blunted model (cid:4) Eq . (cid:1) 17 (cid:2)(cid:5) . In agreement with the elastic behavior , we found negligible values of G (cid:2) . More - over , the E / G (cid:1) ratio obtained for the pyramidal tip (cid:1) 3 . 21 (cid:2) was similar to that of a pure elastic material (cid:1) E / G (cid:1) = 3 , v = 0 . 5 (cid:2) . The consistency between G * and E lends support to the validity of the complex expansion of the blunted pyrami - dal model (cid:4) Eq . (cid:1) 17 (cid:2)(cid:5) . Taking into account the discrepancies between microrheological and macrorheological measure - ments (cid:4) 38 (cid:5) , our data of G (cid:1) compare well with the value of 0 . 52 kPa derived by Normand and co - workers (cid:4) 37 (cid:5) from conventional macroscopic rheology measurements on the same type of agarose at 0 . 3 % . The value of E obtained by ﬁtting the whole d - z curves recorded with the pyramidal tip was twofold higher than that computed with the spherical tip . This difference could reﬂect uncertainties of the calibration procedure of the cantilevers , which assumes a simple har - monic oscillator model for cantilever mechanics . Neverthe - less , E and G * obtained with the two tips are in reasonable agreement , bearing in mind that the difference is comparable to the variability of the gel samples . To test the range of validity of the blunted pyramidal model , we computed the indentation dependence of E in aga - rose gels (cid:1) Fig . 4 (cid:2) . For a linear material , E should be constant over the whole indentation range . Except at low indentations (cid:1) (cid:9) 300 nm (cid:2) , E computed with the blunted pyramidal tip showed a plateau up to the deepest indentation reached (cid:1)(cid:3) 2 (cid:2) m (cid:2) . It is noteworthy that ﬁtting the ideal pyramid model also results in the same plateau , but slightly shifted to deeper indentations . Therefore , for deep indentations , E can be more easily estimated by using Eq . (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) . It has been sug - gested that the linear assumption of the Hertz theory fails for the large strains produced by pyramidal tips (cid:4) 22 (cid:5) . To mini - mize strain , probing the sample with a microsphere has been proposed (cid:4) 21 – 23 (cid:5) . The plateau obtained when probing gels and polymers with a microsphere attached to the cantilever has been taken as evidence of the validity of the spherical contact model (cid:4) 21 (cid:5) . We found that the pyramidal tip exhib - ited a constant regime similar to that observed with the spherical tip . The linear regime displayed by the pyramidal tip is in agreement with ﬁnite element analysis , indicating that high strains applied by sharp tips have only second - order effects on the indentation response for linear materials (cid:4) 34 (cid:5) . Moreover , it should be noted that the blunted proﬁle of con - ventional AFM pyramidal tips reduces the strain in the vicin - ity of the apex . Agarose gels exhibited a parallel fall in E at low indenta - tions with both tips . This behavior has been reported in gels RICO et al . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72 , 021914 (cid:1) 2005 (cid:2) 021914 - 8 and living cells . Large and scattered values of E at low in - dentations have been attributed to experimental noise , to nonlinear elastic behavior of the samples (cid:4) 18 (cid:5) , and to uncer - tainties in the contact point determination (cid:4) 21 – 23 (cid:5) . However , we averaged data from several measurements (cid:1) Fig . 4 (cid:2) to can - cel out the effect of random experimental noise . Moreover , the plateau of E obtained in a wide range of indentations with both tips indicates intrinsic linear mechanical properties of the gel . E estimated at low indentations is very sensitive to uncertainties in the contact point . In fact , the large E we found at low indentations could be explained by an error of 1 – 2 nm in d off . To avoid ambiguities associated with visual determination , we computed the contact point by a robust ﬁtting procedure . The slight but systematic underestimation of cantilever deﬂection by the two contact models in the vicinity of the contact point (cid:1) Fig . 3 (cid:2) suggests that E at low indentations reﬂects features of tip - surface interaction . This underestimation of cantilever deﬂection can be interpreted as a repulsive force . Assuming that agarose and the tip are elec - trically neutral , a repulsive force could arise from steric in - teractions of free - end agarose chains forming brushlike ar - rangements in the gel - liquid interface (cid:4) 39 (cid:5) . The similar fall of E at low indentations and the deeper linear regime exhib - ited by the pyramidal and spherical tips on the agarose gels suggest that both cantilevers are suitable for probing the me - chanical properties of uniform and thick soft samples . The performance of the tips in cells was in agreement with that observed in gels . Both tips displayed large values of E at low indentations , followed by a sharp fall reaching a plateau at (cid:3) 200 nm that extended to the deepest indentation obtained . Similar indentation dependence has been reported in other cell types (cid:4) 18 , 21 , 23 (cid:5) . In accordance with the results found in gels , the plateau value of E estimated with the two tips differed by a factor of (cid:3) 2 . The constant E observed over a broad indentation range indicates a fairly linear behavior of cell mechanics . However , the sharp rise of E at low inden - tions deviated from the linear behavior . This surface singu - larity may reﬂect the effect of steric forces associated with the brushlike glycocalix of living cells (cid:4) 40 , 41 (cid:5) . The repeat - ability of consecutive measurements at the same point taken with both tips (cid:1)(cid:3) 5 % (cid:2) was as good as in the gels . On the other hand , the larger variability among cell regions reﬂected a more heterogeneous mechanical behavior of the cells . Moreover , the higher heterogeneity observed with the pyra - midal tip reﬂects improved lateral resolution . In contrast to the near - elastic behavior of agarose gels , the cells exhibited viscoelastic properties , with the oscillatory response domi - nated by elastic stresses . Similar viscoelastic behavior has also been observed in the same cell type twisting magnetic beads attached to the cell surface (cid:4) 42 (cid:5) . Despite the higher values of the storage and loss moduli measured with the pyramidal tip , their ratio (cid:1) G (cid:2) / G (cid:1) = 0 . 23±0 . 12 (cid:2) was almost coincident with that obtained with the spherical tip (cid:1) 0 . 21±0 . 07 (cid:2) . This indicates that both tips differed only in a scale factor . The agreement between the G (cid:2) / G (cid:1) ratio ob - tained with both tips lends further support to the complex expansion of the blunted pyramidal model (cid:4) Eq . (cid:1) 17 (cid:2)(cid:5) . The use of a pyramidal tip allows us to obtain high - resolution images of the cell and to measure cell mechanics with the same probe . The resolution of the images enables us to observe cell topography in detail and to identify cytoskel - eton ﬁbers and other submembrane structures (cid:1) Fig . 5 (cid:2) . A recent work compared the image resolution obtained with pyramidal and spherical tips on porcine articular cartilage (cid:4) 25 (cid:5) . Individual collagen ﬁbers observed with pyramidal tips were not resolved with microspheres , thus reﬂecting the poor image resolution of such tips . The linear regime of cell me - chanics was clearly reached with the pyramidal tip for inden - tations of (cid:3) 300 nm . The effective contact radius of the py - ramidal tip at this indentation was (cid:3) 200 nm , which provides an estimation of the lateral resolution of the mechanical mea - surements . The use of a single cantilever for imaging and mechanics is an important advantage , which provides precise correlation between viscoelastic mapping and cell structure . We probed the cells at points of 5 – 6 (cid:2) m thickness , reaching indentations up to (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) m . We did not observe hardening effects due to the underlying hard substrate , indicating that the contact model can be reliably applied for indentations up to (cid:3) 20 % of cell thickness . Consequently , the pyramidal tip can probe cell mechanics with indentations up to 300 nm for cell thickness (cid:11) 1 . 5 (cid:2) m . This condition is maintained over a large region of the cell body of the lung epithelial cells . However , measurements at the thin cell periphery would re - quire correction for the inﬂuence of the hard substrate (cid:4) 22 , 23 (cid:5) . In conclusion , we developed a contact model of a blunted pyramidal tip to compute viscoelastic properties of soft samples indented with conventional AFM pyramidal tips . Agarose gels and living cells probed with a blunted pyrami - dal tip exhibited elastic behavior with large values of Young’s modulus for indentations lower than (cid:3) 300 nm and a linear regime at deeper indentations . This indentation de - pendence paralleled that obtained with spherical tips , indicat - ing that the larger strains applied by the pyramidal tip at the apex have minor effects on the force - indentation response . However , Young’s modulus computed in the linear regime with the two tips differs by a factor of (cid:3) 2 . Cells exhibited viscoelastic behavior , with almost coincident values of the loss tangent obtained with both tips . Cells displayed a linear regime for indentations up to (cid:3) 20 % of cell thickness . This allows probing viscoelasticity with the pyramidal tip in a broad central region of the cell body with negligible inﬂu - ence of the hard substrate . Our results suggest that pyramidal tips commonly used for AFM imaging are suitable for prob - ing mechanical properties of soft polymer gels and living cells . The use of a single cantilever enables us to precisely correlate imaging and viscoelastic mapping of living cells .
