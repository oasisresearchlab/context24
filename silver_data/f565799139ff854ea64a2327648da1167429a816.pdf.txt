We show that most F - actin in the cables is oriented such that the barbed end faces the nearest cell tip during interphase ; however , this directionality is reversed during mitosis . These orientations of F - actin ensure proper transport of materials to growing sites during these cell - cycle stages . The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an excellent model for stud - ying cell polarity and cytokinesis . F - actin patches are rich at the growing tips of the cell 1 and F - actin cables run along the long axis of the cell 2 , 3 , while some F - actin patches have been reported to attach to 2 , 3 and move along the cables 4 . These F - actin structures may have important roles in cell growth and cell wall or septum formation during interphase or cell division . The polarity of F - actin is crucial to its function : the barbed end is the preferred end for polymerization , and myosin moves along F - actin towards a specific end depending on the molecular species . Therefore , knowing the directionality of F - actin in the cell is indispensable for understanding the functions of the actin cytoskeleton . However , no study has been done so far on the directionality of F - actin in yeast cells . Here , we aimed to identify the directionality of F - actin in the F - actin cables of the fission yeast cell to gain insight into the role of these cables in polarized cell growth . We visualized the polarity of F - actin in the cell by decoration with myosin heads , to form an arrowhead structure , followed by electron microscopy 5 . Cell wall material had first been digested using enzymes and the cells had been permeabilized in the presence of phalloidin , together with a detergent for myosin S1 ( ref . 6 ) to penetrate the cyto - plasm . The permeabilized cells retained the actin cytoskeleton , and those incubated with S1 did not seem to generate F - actin artefacts ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . Using electron microscopy , bundles of arrowheaded filaments were seen running longitudinally in wild - type cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) , indicating that they were indeed F - actin cables . We traced the bundles , which usually spanned two to six serial sections , and estimated their average length to be about 0 . 8 µm ( see Supplementary 1 Division of Biology , Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , University of Tokyo , Tokyo , 153 - 8902 , Japan . 2 Division of Material and Biological Function Sciences , Graduate School of Science , Japan Women’s University , Tokyo , 112 - 8681 , Japan . 3 Instistute of Medical Mycology , Teikyo University , Tokyo , 192 - 0395 , Japan . 4 Present address : Department of Oral Histology , School of Dentistry , Showa University , Tokyo 142 - 8555 , Japan . 5 Present address : Department of Chemical Genetics , Riken , Wako , 351 - 0198 , Japan . 6 Correspondence should be addressed to I . M . ( e - mail : mabuchi @ ims . u - tokyo . ac . jp ) Published online : 1 September 2005 ; DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb1295 Information , Table S1 ) . We also investigated the F - actin cables of cdc25 - 22 temperature - sensitive mutant 7 cells synchronized at G2 or M phase ( from anaphase to cytokinesis ) . These cables were thicker and longer than those of wild - type cells with an average length of about 2 µ m at either phase ( Fig . 1 ; see also Supplementary Information , Table S1 ) . The difference in cable size in these cells may simply reflect the size of the cells — cdc25 cells grew longer than wild - type cells because they were once G2 - arrested . The length of each F - actin in the cdc25 cables at either phase was 0 . 4 to 0 . 5 µ m ( see Supplementary Information , Table S1 ) . Most of the cables contained F - actin of both directionalities , however individual electron microscopy images showed that one directionality was always dominant . Most F - actin in the G2 cables was oriented such that the barbed end faced the nearest cell tip , whereas most F - actins in the cables at M phase were oriented such that the barbed end faced the mid - region of the cell ( Fig . 1c – e ) . When the G2 cells were treated with 50 µ M latrunculin - A ( Lat - A ) for 10 min to disrupt F - actin , and then washed , the cables reappeared from the tips , suggesting that the tips contain the sites for cable nucleation . However , no recovery of cables was seen after treatment with 200 µ M Lat - A for 1 h ( Fig . 2 ) . Recently , formins have been shown to enhance actin polymerization from the barbed end of the filament in cooperation with profilin 8 . Bni1 in budding yeast and For3 in fission yeast 9 , 10 are formins that are thought to function in the formation of F - actin cables during polarized cell growth . For3 is localized at the cell tip during interphase and at the mid - region of the cell during mitosis . These localizations agree well with the orien - tation of the barbed end of F - actin in cables in the corresponding cell - cycle phases . Furthermore , For3 remains at the cell tip after treatment with 50 µ M Lat - A but disappears after treatment with 200 µ M Lat - A . Therefore , For3 is possibly involved in polymerization of actin from the barbed end to form the cables during both interphase and mitosis . The localization of For3 at the cell tip is dependent on Tea1 and Bud6 ( ref . 11 ) or Rho3 and Cdc42 ( ref . 10 ) , but the factor that influences its localization at the mid - region during mitosis is not known . Thus , it is important to identify such factors in order to understand how the marked change in the directionality of actin filaments is controlled during the cell cycle . ncb1295 . indd 916 ncb1295 . indd 916 12 / 8 / 05 11 : 31 : 02 am 12 / 8 / 05 11 : 31 : 02 am Nature PublishingGroup © 2005 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2005 917 B R I E F C O M M U N I C AT I O N S Type - V myosins are thought to transport vesicles along F - actin to the barbed end , and have an important role in establishing the polarity of the cell 12 . Fission yeast Myo4 / Myo52 is considered to be involved in vesicle transport and thereby in polarized growth 13 , 14 . It moves in the cell tip during interphase , translocates from the tip to the mid - region during early mitosis , and moves in the division site during mitosis 13 . Its locali - zation is dependent on F - actin cables 13 , 14 . Therefore , the cables present during interphase could serve as rails for Myo4 to transport materi - als necessary for polarized growth towards the tips , and those present during mitosis to transport materials necessary for the formation of the contractile ring and septum towards the division site .
