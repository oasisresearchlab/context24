The BOLD signal is temporal correlated with cerebral electrophysiological activities . Therefore , the recording and decoding of the BOLD signal provides insight into human brain function and benefits enormous amount of brain cognitive studies in scientific and medical interest . Although fMRI has become the primary application in the field of brain cognitive science , elusive and enigmatic questions remain . The scope of this dissertation lies in the construction of novel signal processing methods and experimental paradigms with fMRI applications , which devotes to the strategies of decoding brain signals and states . In the first and second studies , we addressed the issue that the fMRI is an indirect measure of neural activity . Since the BOLD signal can be modeled as a convolution of the hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) and latent neural activity and HRF varies across both between individuals and different brain regions within an individual . Therefore , the correlation acquired from the BOLD - level data could lead to false inferences of functional connectivity . The aberrant neurochemical mechanism which control the shape of the HRF have been reported in autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) , schizophrenia ( SZ ) and bipolar disorder ( BP ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that these aberrations would lead to differences in the shape of the HRF between these pathological populations and healthy controls , and the alterations would contribute to the differences in estimating functional connectivity in the BOLD space as compared to the latent iii neural space . We reported that raw fMRI data failed to detect group differences in connectivity analysis when compared that with deconvolved data . Our results are relevant for the understanding of hemodynamic and neurochemical aberrations in pathological groups . In the third study , we applied a novel real - time fMRI ( rt - fMRI ) neurofeedback technology to investigate the insight problem solving . Inspired by a transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) study , we hypothesized that rt - fMRI neurofeedback could enable subjects to up - regulate activity in their right Anterior Temporal Lobe ( rATL ) using neurofeedback , and it could mimic the effects of tDCS in facilitating subjects to solve the nine - dot puzzle . Our results show that approximately 40 % of subjects were able to solve the problem using rt - fMRI neurofeedback , which is similar to the percentage of subjects who were able to solve the puzzle using tDCS . Our results indicated that the group that successfully solved the problem were able to up - regulate the activity over rATL through rt - fMRI neurofeedback while the group that didn’t solve the problem were not able to . Further , we contrasted the brain activation and network obtained from two groups to investigate the neural bias generated by up - regulation of activity in rATL . Our results provideda putative neural mechanisms underlying nine - dot problem solving , and a possible explanation for the top - down inputs into the rATL in enhancing or suppressing creative insight . Furthermore , our study demonstrates that neurofeedback could potentially be used to mimic effects similar to brain stimulation techniques such as tDCS . iv Acknowledgements First and foremost , I wish to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor , Dr .

More specifically , since the brain can’t reserve energy in the form of sugar and oxygen , the neuronal firing calls for a rapid energy supplying favored by cerebral blood flow . When a certain brain region functions , the regional blood releases a greater rate of oxygen to active neurons than to inactive neurons . And then , the unbalanced magnetic changes of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin would be captured by the MRI scanner . In 1990 , Seiji Ogawa et al [ 1 ] first demonstrated that the variations of blood oxygenation in vivo could be detected with the MRI and provided the concept of BOLD . Figure 1 . 1 represents the example of BOLD signal . The BOLD signal is sensitive to cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , venous blood volume ( CBV ) or oxygen metabolism ( CMRO2 ) , where the CBF change is most consistent with fluctuation of BOLD signal and it can be used to estimate changes in CMRO2 [ 2 ] . Therefore , CBF is a valuable tool in exploring the physiological processes underlying neural stimulus - induced BOLD activation . 2 Figure 1 . 1 Example of BOLD signal . Although changes in CBF correlate with energy supplying during brain functional activation [ 3 ] , it’s not simply regulated by the oxygen or energy usage but a set of complex biochemical and electrophysiological processes . Evidence has confirmed that several neurotransmitter - related signaling mediations in neurovascular coupling mechanism regulate the CBF and imply the generation of BOLD single [ 4 ] ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . Glutamate which is released by synapse in response to neural activity primarily regulates the CBF . In neurons , glutamate acts on N - methyl - D - aspartate receptors ( NMDAR ) , causing neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS ) to release nitric oxide ( NO ) . This released NO dilates vessels directly and indirectly in different brain regions [ 6 ] [ 7 ] . Also , glutamate activates astrocyte by acting on metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluR ) and then , astrocyte converted glutamate to glutamine to supply the usage of energy [ 5 ] . During this procedure , astrocyte releases serval neurotransmitters ( e . g . Ca ( 2 + ) , K ( + ) , 20 - hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and etc . ) which are important in mediating CBF [ 6 ] . 3 The γ - - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) also has effects on regulating the CBF . Interneurons release GABA in response to stimulation of the basal forebrain , which inhibits neural activity through the GABA receptors [ 7 ] . Then , the altered neural activity could lead to altered mediation to blood vessels . It is still unclear that the mediation is direct or via agents : neurons or astrocytes . The serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine ) is demonstrated as major vasoconstrictor , providing blood - brain barrier permeability . It modulates neurovascular coupling mechanism either directly or indirectly via the neuronal - astrocytic - vascular tripartite functional unit [ 8 ] . In addition , therapeutic modulation and metabolic aberrance may as well affect the signaling pathways and alter the neurovascular coupling mechanism [ 9 ] . Figure 1 . 2 Signaling pathways of neurovascular coupling mechanism . The interneurons , neurons , and astrocytes release vasoactive mediators , leading to both dilation and constriction of the vessels nearby . 4 1 . 1 . 2 Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging based on BOLD Technology Since Charles Roy and Charles Sherrington demonstrated that blood flow and blood oxygenation are closely linked brain function in 1980 [ 10 ] , Kenneth Kwong et al [ 11 ] first applied the BOLD technique to study activation in the visual cortex in human subjects and termed it as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in 1992 . Through manipulation of stimulus , the rise of BOLD signal was found that lags the neuronal events for few seconds . If the stimulus continuous , which means neurons keep firing , the peak spreads to a flat plateau . After stimulus stops , the BOLD signal falls [ 12 ] . The relationship between changes in brain activity and BOLD signal is indirect and has been speculated , however , the neural basis of the BOLD signal has been gradually demonstrated by experiments which combined other neuroimaging technologies ( e . g . Electroencephalograph ( EEG ) ) and intracortical recordings . Researchers have checked the BOLD signal corresponding to both signals from implanted electrodes ( mostly in monkeys ) and signals of field potentials ( measured outside the skull ) from EEG and MEG , and demonstrated that the local field potential , which includes both post - neuron - synaptic activity and internal neuron processing , better predicts the BOLD signal [ 13 ] . After that , the fMRI technology based on analysis of BOLD signal has gradually became the leading research tool in investigating human brain function . The fMRI technology is applied diversely and multitudinously both in the research world and clinical world . Since it is a noninvasive and it has high spatial resolution ( works at a resolution of 5 tens of micrometers ) and low temporal resolution ( works at hundreds of milliseconds or seconds ) , the fMRI has the advantage in precise functional specialization . The brain mapping is the best established application of fMRI , which applied the fMRI to determine the precise neuroanatomical locations in responsible for specific brain functions [ 14 ] . The functional integration is another well - established application of fMRI , which is describing how different brain areas interact . The high spatial resolution allows the investigation between highly constrained spatial regions in the brain . A wide range of statistical techniques are being used to measure inter - regional connectivity ( e . g . , Independent Component Analysis ) , and " causal " connectivity ( e . g . , Dynamic Granger Causality ) . To date , these two applications have been applied in investigating the brain functional systems and boosted many achievements , including visual , auditory , sensorimotor , emotional , memory , language , attention or control and etc [ 15 ] . Typically , the measured BOLD signal contains many noise signals , such as the artefactual signals due to hardware of the scanner , signal changes due to head motion , multitude of physiological fluctuations of cardiac and respiratory noise , random brain activity , changes in blood pressure and cerebral autoregulation mechanisms and etc [ 16 ] . The non - neuronal noise can introduce spurious common variance across time series and considerably affects the results of task - based and resting state fMRI experiments . In task - based fMRI , it is generally thought that task - based fMRI is sufficiently robust to non - neuronal noise because most fMRI studies repeat a stimulus presentation multiple times and average the response to eliminate the effect [ 12 ] . However , the noise components might confound the timing of the response and introduce variance 6 in the signals from different regions of the brain , thus affecting the estimation of functional or effective connectivity . In resting state fMRI ( rs - fMRI ) , the analysis cannot benefit from an averaging process which removes these non - neuronal noise as it is done in task - based fMRI [ 17 ] . Different methods have been developed to cope with multiple types of noise components and interaction between noise sources , such as developments in acquisition sequences to diminish the system - related artefacts , motion - related correction , physiological - related noise , and etc . However , cleaning the non - neuronal in BOLD measurement and estimating the true neuronal activity are still challenging tasks in fMRI and it could boost the novel applications research world and clinical world . 1 . 1 . 3 Hemodynamic System Modelling The physiological mechanisms mediating the relationship between neuronal activation and BOLD signal have been studied extensively , and the realistic physiological model is extremely complex and hard to be constructed [ 9 ] [ 18 ] . However , studies demonstrated that although the hemodynamic model is nonlinear in nature [ 19 ] , it exhibits relatively linear and time - invariant relationship with regard to specific manipulation of experiment [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . The relationship between neuronal activation and BOLD signal can be approximated by mathematical modeling , which assumes the measured BOLD signal as the neuron activities convolved with the hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) ( Figure 1 . 3 ) . In the paradigm , s ( t ) represents the time series of the stimuli specified as supposed neuronal activity . The f ( t ) represents the measured fMRI signal for a particular voxel , which is calculated as f ( t ) = s ( t ) ⊗ h ( t ) + ε ( t ) , where ε ( t ) represents the noise . The 7 system function h ( t ) , termed as HRF , is determined from the response to an impulse function or Dirac delta function . Figure 1 . 3 Hemodynamic model . In fMRI experiments , this model is sufficient to characterize up to 90 % of the BOLD responses in some cortical regions [ 22 ] . Based on this model , hidden neural states and parameters of the nonlinear / linear dynamic system can be inferred by inversed convolution , and different algorithms of inversion are developed with regard to distinct experiments . The canonical HRF [ 23 ] [ 2 ] is modeled by two Gamma functions with six unknown parameters ( four of them to model the shape and the remaining to scale and baseline respectively ) . Most HRFs share the similar shape across different regions and subjects . Normally , the HRF is estimated by three parameters ( Figure 1 . 4 ) : response height ( RH ) , time - to - peak ( TTP ) , and full - width at half - maximum ( FWHM ) , respectively . L . D . Lewis et al used simultaneous EEG – fMRI and compared evoked potential measured by EEG with the shape of HRF acquired by fMRI [ 24 ] . They reported that the waveform of HRF depends on the underlying dynamic activity pattern and faster HRFs may provide a better representation of the true hemodynamic response [ 24 ] [ 25 ] . Lindquist and 8 Wager [ 26 ] have proposed a scheme to illustrate the relationship between neural activity , observed BOLD response , and estimated HRF parameters ( Figure 1 . 5 ) . The induced change in RH , TTP and FWHM , could be interpreted regarding the latency of neural firing , onset latency , and duration of neural activity . The three parameters are unlikely uniquely interpreted regarding the changes in neuronal activity . The potential cross - talk exists among all the estimated parameters . Moreover , the clear interpretability is constrained by incomplete comprehension in physiology mechanism of BOLD . Figure 1 . 4 Estimates of response height ( RH ) , time - to - peak ( TTP ) , and full - width at half - max ( FMHW ) from a simulated HRF . 9 Figure 1 . 5 The relationship between neural activities , BOLD observation , and estimated HRF parameters [ 26 ] . Solid lines indicate expected relationships ; dashed lines indicate potential relationships that could obstruct the interpretation of estimated parameters . 1 . 1 . 4 Resting State Functional Connectivity The rs - fMRI experimental paradigm measures the BOLD signal when a subject is not performing an explicit task . Even in the absence of cognitive or sensory stimulation , the rs - fMRI BOLD signal displays spontaneous low - frequency fluctuations [ 27 ] [ 28 ] and the significant ongoing spontaneous brain activity has been demonstrated in many literatures [ 29 ] [ 30 ] . The rs - fMRI connectivity is the analysis based on rs - fMRI BOLD signal and it explores the co - activation and co - deactivation between brain regions , even if they are distinct [ 31 ] . It is simply a statement in terms of statistical dependencies among neurophysiological measurements ( e . g . fMRI signal ) , which indicates the “temporal correlations between spatially remote neurophysiological events” [ 31 ] . Recently , the rs - fMRI functional connectivity analysis has become a useful approach to explore the functional network structure of the human brain [ 32 ] [ 33 ] . 10 1 . 1 . 5 Real - time fMRI Neurofeedback The real - time of fMRI data ( rt - fMRI ) neurofeedback technology permits simultaneous measurement and observation of brain activity during an ongoing task . It allows participants to selectively regulate their own brain activity by gaining volitional control over the BOLD signal from specific regions of their own brains provided as a feedback [ 34 ] [ 35 ] . The efficacy of rt - fMRI neurofeedback could be demonstrated by the observed enhanced levels of raw BOLD signals or the enhanced neuronal activation within the regions of interest ( ROIs ) before and after rt - fMRI trials . In previous studies , the self - regulation of brain activity has been achieved in various regions , e . g . , the anterior cingulate cortex for pain control [ 36 ] , the amygdala for the emotional regulation of fear [ 37 ] , etc . Moreover , the learned control over the local brain activity via rt - fMRI neurofeedback training enables the correspondingly changes in behavior [ 34 ] [ 35 ] . Therefore , the rt - fMRI neurofeedback technology could complement traditional neuroimaging techniques by providing more causal insights into the functional role of brain regions in behavior , which allows it to become a promising new approach for the cognitive neuroscience . A rt - fMRI neurofeedback system is usually constructed by a fMRI scanner responsible for data acquisition ( Figure 1 . 6 A ) , a scanner host responsible for data transferring ( Figure 1 . 6 B ) , a computer responsible for data pre - processing in real - time ( Figure 1 . 6 C ) , and a device to show the feedback signal to the participants ( Figure 1 . 6 D ) . The procedure transfers the acquired raw BOLD single to the pre - processed BOLD signal , and presents the feedback signal could be finished within seconds . Therefore , the self - regulation of participants based on the feedback signal could be 11 ensured to be conducted in nearly real time . The participants are usually trained by following the instructions ( e . g . by increasing the signal or decreasing the signal . ) according to different experimental aims . Figure 1 . 6 An architecture of rt - fMRI system is consisted of ( A ) MRI scanner , ( B ) Scanner host ( C ) Image processing computer , and ( D ) Feedback computer . 1 . 1 . 6 Insight Problem Schooler , Ohlsson , and Brooks [ 38 ] defined the insight problem by saying that “an insight problem is well within the competence of the average subject has a high probability of leading to an impasse and has a high probability of ' rewarding ' sustained effort with an aha - experience . ” Unlike non - insight problems , the solutions for insight problems cannot be guaranteed by analytical thinking and prior knowledge , while conceptual restructuring is an important key [ 39 ] . More specifically , while solving , one would try to minimize the difference between the current state of the problem solving and the goal state . Insight only occurs when one realizes that the following analysis steps could not achieve the goal and that a new analysis must be sought . 12 The nine - dot problem is one of the most classic insight problems , which requires both analytical thinking and conceptual restructuring . The problem requires that nine dots be arranged in a square connected by four straight lines drawn without lifting the pen from the paper and without retracing any lines ( Figure 1 . 7 ) . This problem is ridiculously simple in the formal sense that there are only a few possible solutions to try , but ridiculously difficult in the psychological sense that the probability of success approximates 0 % [ 40 ] . The explanation for this phenomenon is because our brains , especially left hemisphere , are wired to interpret the world though the filter of our past experiences , and we are inclined to see the nine - dots as a square , with imposed rigid boundaries . This mechanism is mostly unconscious and cannot be easily overridden . Figure 1 . 7 The nine - dot problem and its solution . The nine - dot puzzle Solution 13 1 . 2 Motivation The high - resolution fMRI is a powerful tool for the noninvasive imaging of human brain . Normally , fMRI is used popularly in mapping brain activity related to specific behaviors [ 41 ] [ 42 ] . In recent years , fMRI has been applied to new decoding - based strategies in human cognitive research which requires new data processing methods and experimental paradigms . Resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs - fMRI ) connectivity is a novel method that estimates the temporal correlation of BOLD signals between spatially remote brain regions in resting state [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] . The relationship between brain regions is referred as resting - state functional connectivity . This allows the characterization of large - scale brain networks both in healthy and clinical populations . To date , a number of studies have employed rs - fMRI functional connectivity in order to understand both shared and distinct neural alterations in pathological populations with healthy controls [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] . However , criticisms were also raised . One important issue in interpreting rs - fMRI functional connectivity lies in that the fMRI BOLD contrast is an indirect measure of neural activity [ 46 ] [ 13 ] . The measured BOLD signal could be considered as a convolution of the latent neural activity with a transfer function – the HRF [ 20 ] and the shape of HRF varies not only across subjects but also across different brain regions in the same subject [ 47 ] [ 48 ] . Besides the underlying neural activity , different non - neural factors could contribute to this variability [ 4 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] . The usefulness of HRF deconvolution is under debate . David et . al [ 53 ] first performed a combined EEG - fMRI study that proved the theoretical possibility of HRF deconvolution in improving interregional coupling estimation from hidden 14 neural states of fMRI . Previous discussions on evaluating effective connectivity from fMRI data also reached the conclusion that it is better to use state - space model for inferring causality on hidden neural states [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] . In the light of these works , we continue the discussions into rs - fMRI connectivity analysis . As mentioned above , the examined synchronicity between observed BOLD data in any two given regions would be blurred by the varying HRF due to non - neural factors . And the false inferences of functional connectivity could be observed in two situations : ( i ) the BOLD data are highly correlated while the underlying latent neural signals are not ( Figure 1 . 8 A ) ; ( ii ) the underlying latent neural signals are highly correlated while the BOLD data are not ( Figure 1 . 8 B ) . Figure 1 . 8 Illustration of the impact of HRF variability on functional connectivity analysis . The measured BOLD signal , retrieved latent neural signal and the voxel - level HRF are shown . ( A ) Two BOLD time series are low correlated while the correlation between underlying neural signals is high . ( B ) Two BOLD time series are highly correlated while the correlation between underlying neural signals is low . Since , factors other than neural activity could contribute to this variability was confirmed in ASD [ 57 ] , SZ [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] and BP [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] , we hypothesized that this could potentially cause systematic differences in the shape of the HRF between pathological populations 15 and healthy controls , and the altered HRF will lead to differences in estimated functional connectivity in the fMRI space as compared to the latent neural space . We aimed to demonstrate that the possible confounds introduced by the variable HRF in identified functional networks of pathological populations . The rt - fMRI neurofeedback technology is another novel neuroimaging technology applied in human cognitive research . It allows on - line analysis and feedback of BOLD signal from a targeted ROI . Compared with other neuroimaging techniques , the rt - fMRI neurofeedback technology provides the only non - invasive method that could acquire the feedback signal of the deep subcortical brain regions . In previous studies , the self - regulation of brain activity has been observed in various regions , e . g . , the anterior cingulate cortex for pain control [ 36 ] , the amygdala for the emotional regulation of fear [ 37 ] , etc . Studies also demonstrated that the learned control over the local brain activity via rt - fMRI neurofeedback training was able to cause the specific changes in behavior [ 34 ] [ 35 ] . Although much progress has been achieved , the applications of rt - fMRI technology are still being explored . The capability of tracking brain activations could lead to new research modalities and practical applications in both clinical and daily life . Therefore , we propose a novel application of rt - fMRI in brain stimulation . Based on the research that applied the transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) targeted on right anterior temporal lobe ( rATL ) , a surprisingly large number of people ( 40 % ) were able to solve the nine - dot puzzle [ 66 ] . We aimed to mimic this tDCS by applying rt - fMRI technology , which could provide a new paradigm for 16 cognitive neuroscience to study brain plasticity . We also aimed to estimate the functional relevance of regulated brain areas by modification of insight problem solving . 1 . 3 Organization of the Dissertation This dissertation is organized into 6 chapters .

For each voxel , the observed response variable Y is formulated based on a General Linear Model ( GLM ) , 𝑌 = 𝑋𝛽 + 𝜀 ( 2 . 1 ) X is a design matrix , which is a linear combination of explanatory variables and 𝜀 is a well - behaved error term [ 67 ] . 𝛽 is a matrix of parameters that represents the relative contribution of each of these columns in design matrix X . This formulation allows the assessment of the F - statistic 18 about these contributions by testing the null hypothesis according to a given contrast , the linear combination of the contrasts , or all of them together . 2 . 3 . 2 False Discovery Rate Controlling When a large number of statistical tests are performed simultaneously , the probability of making at least one false positive ( type I error ) among the family of hypothesis tests is defined as the family - wise error rate ( FWER ) . The FWER would cause the classic confidence intervals , and p - values fail to reject the null hypothesis . False discovery rate ( FDR ) controlling is a technique that quantifies the statistical significance of multiple statistical tests [ 68 ] [ 69 ] . Mathematically , it adjusts the false discovery proportion ( FDP ) , which is defined as the proportion of false discoveries among total rejections . Suppose 𝑁 ( null ) hypotheses , 𝐻 1 , 𝐻 2 , … , 𝐻 𝑁 , are tested simultaneously at a level  . Their corresponding p - values are sorted in an ascending order , 𝑃 1 , 𝑃 2 , … , 𝑃 𝑁 . Find the largest 𝑘 that satisfies 𝑃 𝑘 ≤ 𝑘 𝑁 𝛼 , then Reject the null hypothesis 𝐻 𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1 , 2 , … , 𝑘 , where 𝐻 𝑖 = 0 , when the 𝑖 th null hypothesis is true , and 𝐻 𝑖 = 1 when the 𝑖 th alternative is true . Let 𝑝 𝑖 ≤ 𝑡 , for 𝑖 = 1 , 2 , … , 𝑚 and 𝑡 ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . Therefore the FDP is calculated as : 𝐹𝐷𝑃 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠 = ∑ { 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑃 𝑖 : 𝑃 𝑖 ≤𝑡 } 𝑖 ∑ { 𝑃 𝑖 ≤𝑡 } ( 2 . 2 ) The FDR controlling for a multiple testing threshold 𝛼 is defined as the expected FDP using that procedure : 𝐹𝐷𝑅 = 𝐸 ( 𝐹𝐷𝑃 ( 𝑡 ) ) ( 2 . 3 ) 19 The FDR controlling has been intrudouced in many applications across different fields and was introduced by Genovese et al into the filed of neuroimaging at 2002 [ 70 ] . 2 . 2 Image processing 2 . 2 . 1 Pre - processing Pre - processing is necessary for fMRI analysis , which prepares the acquired raw data before being applied to statistical analysis . It applies various image and signal processing techniques to reduce noise and artifacts ( e . g . head motion , field non - uniformity , acquisition synchrony , etc . [ 12 ] ) in BLOD signal . The pre - processing steps are crucial in making the statistical analysis valid in the subsequent analyses . The usual method of pre - processing is to apply sequential individual processing steps in a particular order . However , the interactions between these steps may cause the loss of statistical power and the different post fMRI data analyses require distinct sets of preprocessing [ 12 ] . Consequently , each preprocessing step needs to be understood and considered carefully . There is a move towards developing more integrated approaches to pre - processing . At present , though , it is still common to have separate , independent pre - processing steps described in the following . ( 1 ) Slice timing correction At every time point , one functional volume was acquired . The functional volume was combined by slices . All the slices can be acquired within one repetition time ( TR ) and this procedure evenly spread over the TR . Since TR was short , the volume should be assumed that all the slices were captured at the same time . Otherwise , it would invalidate following statistical 20 analysis . Slice timing correction aims at adjusting slices that were acquired in different times during the same TR to a common reference time . In detail , for each slice in one TR , the temporal adjustment is usually achieved by resampling the time series of slice by applying sinc interpolation backward or forward , and taking the value at the same reference time for all the slices . Then , the value of every voxel in the volume can be considered as acquired at the same time . ( 2 ) Realignment The object of realignment is to determine the rigid body transformation and to best map the series of functional volumes in the common space . It estimates the six parameters of the rigid body transformation ( three translations and three rotations respectively ) and minimizes the mean squared difference between each successive volume and reference volume . ( 3 ) Coregistration and normalization Coregistration is the process of registering functional and structural images from the same subject to map functional information into anatomical space by taking the constant overall shape . Spatial normalization aims to map the human brain of different sizes into a standard template , which makes them comparable to each other and could boost the statistical power in fMRI analysis . 2 . 2 . 2 Deconvolution The fMRI BOLD signal is the indirect measurement of neural activity and this may raise many issues when it is used as a tool in brain investigations [ 71 ] ( e . g . effective connectivity [ 53 ] ) . Based on the model that considers fMRI signal as a filtered version of neural activity ( Figure 1 . 3 ) , the inversion of the modeled hemodynamic system is termed as ‘deconvolution’ . This procedure 21 allows the extraction of HRF and estimation of hidden neuronal activation from the observed fMRI signal theoretically . The deconvolution method is an ill - posed problem since both the HRF , and the latent neural input are unknown and only the output of the convolution ( fMRI signal ) is measured . Therefore , the precision of the observation ( such as temporal resolution , signal to noise ratio and etc . ) , as well as the algorithms that optimize the problem could affect the accuracy of estimation of neural activation . ( 1 ) Deconvolution using Kalman filtering This deconvolution method estimates the coupled dynamical systems based on nonlinear Kalman filtering [ 72 ] . The algorithm formulates a model with the continuous process equation and a discrete measurement , and applies a forward pass using the cubature Kalman filter ( CKF ) [ 73 ] . In detail , the method considers a discrete - time nonlinear dynamic system , where the system’s hidden states cannot be observed . The state - space model for joint estimation of state and parameter is formulated as : 𝑥̃ 𝑡 = [ 𝑥 𝑡 𝑢 𝑡 𝜃 𝑡 ] = [ 𝑭 ( 𝑥 𝑡−1 , 𝜃 𝑡−1 , 𝑢 𝑡−1 ) 𝑢 𝑡−1 𝜃 𝑡−1 ] + [ 𝑞 𝑡−1 𝑣 𝑡−1 𝑤 𝑡−1 ] ( 2 . 4 ) 𝑦 𝑡 = 𝑔 ( 𝑥̃ 𝑡 ) + 𝑟 𝑡−1 ( 2 . 5 ) Where 𝑥 𝑡 is the state vector , 𝜃 𝑡 is the parameter vector and 𝑢 𝑡 is the input vector ; 𝑤 𝑡 is the “artificial” process noise vector , 𝑣 𝑡 input noise vector , 𝑞 𝑡 is the zero - mean Gaussian state 22 noise vector ; 𝑦 𝑡 is the simultaneously observed noisy signal , and 𝑟 𝑡 is random Gaussian measurement noise vector . Then the method introduces a forward pass using the of the square - root version of CKF , which is finessed by a backward pass and aims to obtain smoothed estimates of states , input and parameters . In this continuous dynamic system , the discretization of process equations of both forward pass and backward pass are discretized by a local linearization [ 74 ] scheme for all cubature points . The log - likelihood were evaluated at each iteration and the iteration would terminate when increment of the ( negative ) log - likelihood is less than a tolerance value . This procedure furnishes posterior estimates of both the hidden states and the parameters of a system , including any unknown exogenous input . ( 2 ) Blind deconvolution using Wiener filter The blind deconvolution proposed by Wu et al models the resting fMRI data as ‘pseudo - events’ time series with randomly occurring events [ 75 ] . The ‘pseudo - events’ time series is constructed by searching the local peak beyond a threshold ( Figure 2 . 1 ) and is adjusted by considering the time delay in hemodynamic response following the neural activity . Then , the time series convolved by the canonical HRF is fitted into measured BOLD signal by applying the general linear model , and the noise error covariance is calculated . By searching through all integer values in the interval of time delay [ 0 𝑘 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ] , the time series achieves the smallest noise error covariance is chosen as the input neural activity time series 𝑠 ( 𝑡 ) . The 𝑠 ( 𝑡 ) is formulated as following : 23 s ( t ) = ∑ 𝛿 ( 𝑡 − 𝜏 ) ∞𝜏 = 0 ( 2 . 6 ) Following Glover’s classic deconvolution method [ 20 ] , the measured BOLD signal can be described as : 𝑏 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑠 ( 𝑡 ) ⊗ ℎ ( 𝑡 ) + 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) ( 2 . 7 ) where 𝑏 ( 𝑡 ) is the measured BOLD signal , ℎ ( 𝑡 ) is HRF , and 𝜀 ( 𝑡 ) is the noise . The h ̃ ( t ) could be obtained by applying Wiener filter d ( 𝑡 ) : h ̃ ( t ) = d ( t ) ⊗ 𝑏 ( 𝑡 ) ( 2 . 8 ) Combine the above formulate and the Fourier transform of Wiener filter can be obtained by turning to D ( ω ) = H ′ ( ω ) | H ( ω ) | 2 + | N ( ω ) | 2 ( 2 . 9 ) For white noise , the spectrum is a constant and is calculated as | 𝑁 ( 𝜔 ) | 2 = 𝑁 02 The HRF can be estimated as ℎ̃ ( t ) = ℱ −1 { 𝐷 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐵 ( 𝜔 ) } = ℱ −1 { 𝑆 ′ ( 𝜔 ) 𝐵 ( 𝜔 ) | 𝑆 ( 𝜔 ) | 2 + | 𝑁 ( 𝜔 ) | 2 } ( 2 . 10 ) Finally , the deconvolution is performed by applying voxel specified HRF and Wiener filter back into the linear model : The estimated neural activity could be acquired by : 𝑠̃ ( 𝑡 ) = ℱ −1 { 𝐷 ( 𝜔 ) 𝐻̃ ( 𝜔 ) } = ℱ −1 { 𝐻̃ ′ ( 𝜔 ) 𝐵 ( 𝜔 ) | 𝐻̃ ( 𝜔 ) | 2 + | 𝑁 ( 𝜔 ) | 2 } ( 2 . 11 ) 24 This deconvolution method has the advantage of requiring no prior information of the neural event . Furthermore , it returns three parameters characterizing the HRF of each voxel for further HRF examination . Figure 2 . 1 Constructing ‘pseudo - events’ time series . Figure 2 . 2 Blind - deconvolution pipeline . 25 2 . 3 Connectivity Analysis based on fMRI 2 . 3 . 1 The rs - fMRI Functional Connectivity Analysis The most widely applied estimation of rs - fMRI functional connectivity is Pearson correlation coefficient [ 76 ] . It assumes these fMRI measurements conform to Gaussian assumptions and then characterizes the correlations or covariance ( correlations are normalized covariance ) of each voxel or the averaged time series in voxels or region of interests ( ROIs ） . For two fMRI time series 𝑥 , 𝑦 with n observations ( e . g . , time points of fMRI signal ) , the correlation coefficient 𝜌 𝑥 , 𝑦 is calculated as : 𝜌 𝑥 , 𝑦 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣 ( 𝑋 , 𝑌 ) 𝜎 𝑥 𝜎 𝑦 ( 2 . 12 ) where cov stands for the covariance , which is expressed in terms of mean and expectation : 𝑐𝑜𝑣 ( 𝑋 , 𝑌 ) = 𝐸 [ ( 𝑋 − 𝜇 𝑥 ) ( 𝑌 − 𝜇 𝑦 ) ] ( 2 . 13 ) 𝜎 𝑥 , 𝜎 𝑦 are the standard deviations of 𝑋 , 𝑌 . 𝜇 𝑥 , 𝜇 𝑦 are the means of 𝑋 , 𝑌 . 𝐸 is the expectation . 2 . 3 . 2 Fisher Z - transformation Fisher ' s z - transformation is a statistical transformation that converts Pearson ' s correlation coefficient 𝑟 to the normally distributed variable 𝑧 [ 77 ] . Because , when the population correlation coefficient is not equal to zero , the distribution of 𝑟 is somewhat skewed . 26 For a given population of correlation , the Fisher’s 𝑧 values for a sample of size 𝑛 are virtually normally distributed with a variance of 1 / ( n − 3 ) . Thus , the standard error of a Fisher ' s z transformed correlation is 1 / √𝑛 − 3 . Fisher’s 𝑧 values are calculated as 1 2 [ ln ( 1 + 𝑟 ) − ln ( 1 − 𝑟 ) ] ( 2 . 14 ) 2 . 3 . 3 Dynamic Granger Causality The Granger causality ( GC ) [ 78 ] is a statistical concept which infers whether the information in past variable 𝑋 = [ 𝑥 ( 1 ) , 𝑥 ( 2 ) , … 𝑥 ( 𝑡 ) ] could benefit the prediction of present variable 𝑌 = [ 𝑦 ( 1 ) , 𝑦 ( 2 ) , … 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) ] . The identification of causality relationship is based on statistical hypothesis . If “X” happens prior to “Y” , “X” could be referred as the cause , while “Y” could be referred as the effect . When the present value of Y could be evaluated based on its own past values and the past values of another varied variable X , the X could be considered as granger - causes Y [ 79 ] [ 80 ] . Therefore , the null hypothesis is stated as the X does not granger - cause Y , while the alternate hypothesis is stated as the X granger - causes Y . To test the null hypothesis , a univariate autoregression of Y could be formulated as following 𝑦 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 0 + 𝑎 1 𝑦 ( 𝑡 − 1 ) + 𝑎 2 𝑦 ( 𝑡 − 2 ) + ⋯ 𝑎 𝑚 𝑦 ( 𝑡 − 𝑚 ) + 𝜀 1 ( 𝑡 ) ( 2 . 15 ) where 𝑚 is the number of lags for Y . 27 For the alternate hypothesis , a multivariate autoregression of Y is augmented by including lagged values of X : 𝑦 𝑎𝑢𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑎 0 + 𝑎 1 𝑦 ( 𝑡 − 1 ) + 𝑎 2 𝑦 ( 𝑡 − 2 ) + ⋯ 𝑎 𝑚 𝑦 ( 𝑡 − 𝑚 ) + 𝑏 0 + 𝑏 1 𝑥 ( 𝑡 − 𝑛1 ) + 𝑏 2 𝑥 ( 𝑡 − 1 ) + ⋯ 𝑏 𝑛 𝑥 ( 𝑡 − 𝑛 ) + 𝜀 2 ( 𝑡 ) ( 2 . 16 ) where 𝑛 is the number of lags for X . The F - statistic of 6 2 ( 𝑦 ) − 6 2 ( 𝑦 𝑎𝑢𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑 ) is calculated to examine whether all lagged values of x add explanatory power to the regression . In practice , there could be more than two variables which granger - causes each other . Therefore , the multivariate granger causality analysis is usually performed by fitting GC into multivariate vector autoregressive model ( MVAR ) [ 39 ] . For be a k - dimensional multivariate time series . The variable vector is formulated as : 𝑆 ( 𝑡 ) = [ 𝑠 1 ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑠 2 ( 𝑡 ) , ⋯ , 𝑠 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) ] （ 2 . 17 ） The multivariate GC model [ 81 ] is given by : 𝑆 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐴 ′ ( 0 , 𝑡 ) 𝑆 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝐴 ′ ( 1 , 𝑡 ) 𝑆 ( 𝑡 − 1 ) + ⋯ + 𝐴 ′ ( 𝑝 , 𝑡 ) 𝑆 ( 𝑡 − 𝑝 ) + 𝐸 ( 𝑡 ) （ 2 . 18 ） where the model coefficients 𝐴′ were estimated by using variable parameter regression [ 82 ] , and p is an arbitrary time delay [ 83 ] which calculates the optimal set of coefficients that minimizes the model error E ( t ) . The coefficient 𝐴 ′ ( p , 𝑡 ) indicates the degree to the involvement of the past 28 𝑋 ( 𝑡 − 𝑝 ) in predicting the present 𝑋 ( 𝑡 ) . The sum of all coefficients corresponding to all delays at time 𝑡 is considered as Dynamic Granger Causality ( DGC ) , and calculated as : 𝐷𝐺𝐶 𝑖𝑗 ( 𝑡 ) = ∑ 𝑎′ 𝑖𝑗 𝑝𝑛 = 1 ( 𝑛 , 𝑡 ) （ 2 . 19 ） In this framework , 𝐷𝐺𝐶 𝑖𝑗 is the strength of causal relationship from component i to component j at time instant t , where all values of component 𝑖 at past 𝑝 timepoint at component 𝑖 together were involved in the prediction of the present value in component 𝑗 . The 𝑎′ 𝑖𝑗 are the elements of coefficient matrix 𝐴′ . 2 . 3 . 4 Visualization of Connectivity Since the brain itself functions as a complex network , graph theoretic approaches are a natural and attractive choice for fMRI connectivity analysis . In brain functional network analysis , functional brain regions are projected as nodes and the connectivity between each pair of regions as edge . Therefore , the visualization of brain network should be considered both based on graph theory and brain structure . ( 1 ) Directly diagram In directly diagram , the functional units are represented as nodes and the edges are represented as straight lines , polylines , or curves on the Euclidean plane . By using arrowheads , weighted node or edges , directly connectivity diagram could carry additional information , such as orientation or classified subnetwork . The adjustability of position allows flexible network display . However , the 29 designed space for the visualization of weighted graphs is limited due to the use of color , and the actual structural position cannot be displayed . In addition , if diagrams represent dense graphs , it is not sufficient to encode weight and orientation of the edge . ( 2 ) Connectivity matrix The connectivity matrix is defined as a correlation matrix between brain functional units ( voxel or ROIs ) . It is a square matrix , and the value of each element of the matrix indicates the weighted edges in pair - wise nodes , identified by its index of row and line . Connectivity matrix visualization is advantageous for avoiding any wasted space . Especially for a large sparse graph , it requires less storage space and the captivity of storage facilitates the encoding of additional information in cells more effectively . However , this visualized method is limited in localizing the structural position and identifying the structure of network . ( 3 ) 3D Graph In the 3D node - link diagrams , ROIs are shown as nodes and weighted edges denote the straight line of pair - wise nodes . Additional information can be encoded by the size or color of the nodes , and the thickness and color of the edges . The biggest advantage of the 3D graph is that all the nodes are localized in its structural position . In addition , it could facilitate the comparison by overlaying two connectivity datasets . However , images of large datasets are still cluttered and suffer from the known side effects of the 3D rendering such as occlusion . All this renders it difficult to perform accurate visualization . 30 Chapter 3 Aberrant Hemodynamic Responses in Autism : Implications for Resting State fMRI Functional Connectivity Studies Abstract Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) is modeled as a convolution of the hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) and an unmeasured latent neural signal . However , the HRF itself is variable across brain regions and subjects . This variability is induced by both neural and non - neural factors . Aberrations in underlying neurochemical mechanisms which control the shape of the HRF have been reported in Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that this will lead to voxel - specific , yet systematic differences in the shape of the HRF between individuals with Autism and healthy controls . As a corollary , we also hypothesized that such alterations will lead differences in estimated functional connectivity in the fMRI space as compared to the latent neural space . In order to test these hypotheses , we performed blind deconvolution of resting state fMRI time series acquired from large number of ASD and control subjects obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ( ABIDE ) database . Many brain regions previously implicated in Autism showed systematic differences in HRF shape in the ASD population . Specifically , we found that the precuneus had aberrations in all HRF parameters . 31 Consequently , we obtained precuneus - seed - based functional connectivity differences between ASD and controls in fMRI as well as latent neural space . We report that raw fMRI data failed to detect group differences in connectivity between precuneus and certain brain regions that were however observed in deconvolved data . Our results are relevant for the understanding of hemodynamic and neurochemical aberrations in ASD , as well as have methodological implications for resting state functional connectivity studies in Autism and more generally in disorders that are accompanied by neurochemical alterations that may impact HRF shape . Keywords : Resting - state fMRI , Deconvolution , Autism , Hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) , Seed - based functional connectivity 3 . 1 Introduction Resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) is widely used to examine brain networks by investigating temporal correlations of the blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) signals in different brain regions [ 84 ] [ 85 ] . Specifically in the case of Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) , resting state fMRI based functional connectivity studies could be used to identify potential biomarkers [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ] . For example , the underconnectivity of the superior temporal sulcus that predicts emotion recognition deficits ASD have been reported [ 89 ] . Also deficits in the somatosensory , default mode , and visual regions have been highlighted in characterizing ASD [ 90 ] . Notwithstanding the strides made in understanding the neurobiology underlying ASD using resting state fMRI functional connectivity , one drawback of the method is that the BOLD signal only provides an indirect measurement of neural activity [ 46 ] , i . e . the observed BOLD signal is a 32 convolution of latent neural activity with the hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) . The HRF is the transfer function that broadly represents neurovascular coupling . This could raise many issues while using the BOLD signal as a tool for examining and inferring neural activity . Specifically problematic is the large variability of the HRF across subjects , as well as across brain regions in the same subject [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 91 ] . Further , the HRF seems to vary across pathological populations [ 57 ] [ 92 ] and can be influenced by the composition of the Genome [ 49 ] . With specific reference to ASD , prior studies have shown alterations in neurotransmitters which control neurovascular coupling [ 57 ] , and this could potentially cause changes in the HRF . Therefore , if the HRF varies due to any factors other than underlying neural activity , it could lead to false inferences of functional connectivity because synchronicity between observed BOLD data in any two given brain regions may or may not exist in latent neural data depending on the differences in HRF shape between the two given regions ( Figure 3 . 1 ) [ 93 ] . Therefore , our objective in this work is to investigate the effects of HRF variability on resting state fMRI functional connectivity estimates in the ASD population . In order to do so , we utilize blind deconvolution of resting state fMRI data [ 75 ] from ASD and control populations and characterize functional connectivity differences before and after deconvolution . 33 Figure 3 . 1 Illustration of the impact of HRF variability on functional connectivity analysis . Both measured BOLD signal , retrieved latent neural signal and the voxel - level HRF are shown . ( A ) Two real fMRI data timeseries that have low correlation while the correlation between underlying neural signals is high . ( B ) Two real fMRI data timeseries that are highly correlated while the correlation between underlying neural signals is low . This apparent dissociation between BOLD and latent neural space is induced by the spatial variability of the HRF shape ( especially , its latency ) , as illustrated . In fMRI task paradigms , the neural activity as well as the BOLD response is entrained to the external sensory input or the motor output . Hence , it is relatively straightforward to deconvolve the HRF and recover latent neural activity , as the timing of neural events is known [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] . However , this is not true in case of resting state wherein the neural events must be estimated from the data [ 16 ] [ 96 ] or inferred from independent measurements of electrical activity [ 53 ] before deconvolution is performed . In this study , we employ the resting state fMRI deconvolution method proposed by Wu et al [ 16 ] , which is based on assuming resting state data to be generated by neural events at random times and then performing Weiner deconvolution . 34 In ASD , the abnormalities of the neurotransmitters which control neurovascular coupling are well established [ 57 ] [ 97 ] . Thus , we hypothesized that the HRF , which depends on cerebrovascular reactivity and neurovascular coupling , may be altered between ASD and the healthy control groups , thereby altering inferred group differences in resting state functional connectivity . We examined voxel - specified HRFs obtained by deconvolving each voxel time series and characterized group differences of HRF shape in terms of three parameters : time - to - peak ( TTP ) , response height ( RH ) , and full - width at half - max ( FMHW ) ( see Figure 3 . 2 ) . We determined brain regions with the significantly altered HRF between the ASD and the control groups . Further , we examined possible impacts of the altered HRF on the resting state fMRI functional connectivity differences between the groups . Figure 3 . 2 Estimates of response height ( RH ) , time - to - peak ( TTP ) , and full - width at half - max ( FMHW ) from a simulated HRF . 35 3 . 2 Materials and methods 3 . 2 . 1 Resting - states fMRI Data The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ( ABIDE ) [ 98 ] consists of resting state fMRI data from 1102 subjects contributed by 17 different institutions , including 531 individuals with ASD and 571 age - and sex - matched typical controls . Of these subjects , 739 were males , and 363 were females ( Table 3 . 1 ) . The data from each subject consisted of resting functional MRI acquisitions and a volumetric magnetization - prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo ( MPRAGE ) image . Local Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ) approved the study protocol at each institution , the subjects provided informed consent and the data was fully anonymized in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) guidelines .

For each individual participant’s data set , the first 4 image volumes were discarded . The remaining volumes underwent the following pre - processing steps . Slice time correction was performed by shifting the signal measured in each slice relative to the acquisition of the slice at the mid - point of each TR . Realignment of all the images by using the six rigid body motion parameters was followed by spatial normalization of the data to the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) template . Then we regressed out head motion effects from the fMRI signal with a 24 - parameter ( 6 head motion parameters , 6 head motion parameters one time point before , and the 12 corresponding squared items ) model [ 102 ] . The signals from the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid were regressed out to reduce respiratory and cardiac effects . At this point , the processing pipeline was split into two . In the first pipeline , the data was deconvolved using the method proposed by Wu et al [ 16 ] , and the resulting latent neural 37 variables were temporally bandpass filtered in the ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 Hz ) range . We will refer to this as the deconvolved ( DC ) dataset . In the second pipeline , the data was not deconvolved ( hitherto referred to as non - deconvolved or NDC dataset ) , but was subjected to temporal bandpass filtering in the ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 Hz ) range . 3 . 2 . 3 Blind Deconvolution and HRF Estimation In order to characterize HRF variability in the data [ 48 ] , we employed a blind deconvolution technique developed for resting state fMRI by Wu et al [ 75 ] . It is based on the idea that the resting state BOLD signal could be considered as the convolution of a voxel - specific HRF and spontaneous neural events occurring at random times [ 103 ] Spontaneous neural events were detected by picking up BOLD fluctuations of relatively large amplitude as pseudo neural events [ 103 ] . This was done after potential sources of noise were reduced or eliminated to the extent possible so that spikes contributed by noise sources were not mistaken for neural events . These pseudo - event onsets were then shifted with different delays in order to determine the delay at which the model fit was greatest . Once the pseudo - events and their onsets were determined , voxel - specific HRFs and the latent neural variables were reconstructed from the raw BOLD signal using Weiner deconvolution [ 20 ] . The estimated HRFs were characterized by three parameters : response height ( RH ) , time - to - peak ( TTP ) , and full - width at half - wax ( FWHM ) . The parameters were Z - scored . Also , a one - way ANONVA analysis was performed , and the result indicated there are no differences between parameters which acquired by the fMRI data 38 provided by different sites . A two - way ANONVA analysis was performed to check the interaction between group and sites , and the result indicated no interaction between group and sites . 3 . 2 . 4 Seed Region Selection Our motive was to find brain regions that had alterations in all the three HRF parameters ( TTP , FWHM and RH ) in ASD compared to control subjects and use these regions as seeds to perform functional connectivity mapping with DC and NDC data . Two sample two - tailed t - tests were conducted using ASD and control samples separately for the three parameters to obtain maps indicating voxels with statistically significant difference ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 , cluster size > 50 voxels ) between the groups . This resulted in two maps per parameter ( ASD > control and control > ASD ) and six maps overall . These maps were overlapped to obtain brain regions that had alterations in all the three HRF parameters . We found that this corresponded to the precuneus where in all the three HRF parameters were greater in controls compared to ASD . Therefore , precuneus was selected as the seed region of interest ( seed ROI ) for calculating resting functional connectivity maps with the remaining brain regions ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . Table 3 . 2 lists the details of the chosen seed region , including the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) coordinates of the cluster as well as cluster size . 3 . 2 . 5 Seed - based Functional Connectivity For each participant , seed - based connectivity maps were obtained by evaluating Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the mean time series from the precuneus seed ROI and the rest of 39 the pre - processed voxel time series in the brain . A Fisher ' s z - transform was applied to improve the normality of these correlation coefficients [ 104 ] [ 105 ] . The converted z - score maps hereafter are referred to as “the correlation maps” . This pipeline was implemented separately for the two datasets : ( i ) NDC : data pre - processed without deconvolution , and ( ii ) DC : data pre - processed with deconvolution . 3 . 2 . 6 Group - level Analyses The z – score maps from individual subjects were entered into a random effect one - sample t - test to determine the brain regions showing significant connectivity to the precuneus within each group . They were also entered into a random effect two - sample t - test to identify the regions showing significant differences in connectivity to the precuneus between control and ASD groups [ 106 ] . These procedures were also implemented separately for both DC and NDC datasets . 3 . 2 . 7 The Effect of Deconvolution To investigate the effect of deconvolution on between - group differences in functional connectivity , a two - way repeated - measures ANOVA was performed within each voxel connected with the precuneus seed . We considered the groups ( Control and ASD ) as one factor and with / without applying deconvolution as the other factor . The voxels showing a significant interaction between the two factors ( FDR corrected , p < 0 . 05 ) were identified . Statistical tests were performed using SPSS ( version 20 , IBM Inc . , USA ) . 40 3 . 3 Result 3 . 3 . 1 Inter - group HRF Differences We found that the bilateral inferior occipital gyrus and precuneus had significantly higher RH ( Figure 3 . 3A ) in the control group while the middle frontal gyrus and bilateral rectus had significantly ( p < 0 . 05 FDR corrected ) higher RH ( Figure 3 . 3B ) in the ASD group . The bilateral parietal lobule , bilateral rectus , supramarginal gyrus , superior temporal gyrus , and precuneus exhibited significantly higher FWHM ( Figure 3 . 3C ) in the control group while the middle temporal gyrus exhibited significantly higher FWHM ( Figure 3 . 3D ) in the ASD group . The left lingual gyrus and precuneus showed significantly higher TTP ( Figure 3 . 3E ) in the control group . Detailed information such as cluster sizes , cluster centroids etc . are represented in Table 2 . We found that only one cluster within the precuneus showed alterations in all three HRF parameters ( Figure 3 . 4 ) ( note : RH , TTP and FWHM were higher in Control group in this region compared to ASD ) . 41 Figure 3 . 3 Spatial maps showing regions with significantly different HRF parameters in ASD as compared to the control group .

For the control group , the positive functional connectivity between precuneus and the medial frontal lobe as well as negative functional connectivity between precuneus and right superior temporal gyrus ( also containing a bit of the Insula ) were detected , while these were not detected in the ASD group . In the DC dataset , more clusters significantly connected with the precuneus were detected in both groups ( Figures 3 . 5A and 3 . 5C ) . In the ASD group , in addition to precuneus – bilateral angular gyrus connectivity that was observed with NDC data , additional significant positive functional connectivity between precuneus and the medial frontal gyrus was detected . Likewise , in the control group , functional connectivities identified with NDC data were also identified using DC data . Additionally , positive functional connectivity between the precuneus and right middle temporal gyrus as well as negative functional connectivity with right supramarginal gyrus and bilateral insula were also detected . It is noteworthy that for regions identified to be functionally connected to precuneus in both DC and NDC datasets , those obtained from the DC dataset had a larger spatial extent ( Table 3 . 3 ) . 44 Figure 3 . 5 Within group functional connectivity maps with precuneus seed .

In the DC dataset , the superior temporal gyrus , insula and right supramarginal gyrus showed higher negative connectivity with precuneus in the control group while bilateral angular gyrus , medial frontal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus showed higher positive connectivity in the control group compared to ASD ( Figure 3 . 6 , Table 3 . 4 ) .

This means that group differences between ASD and Controls in these regions would be inferred differently in DC and NDC data .

In order to do so , we estimated the HRF at each voxel using a blind deconvolution technique and characterized significant differences in HRF characteristics such as RH , FWHM and TTP . Further , resting state functional connectivity maps obtained from DC and NDC data had significant differences and this impacted inferences about group differences derived from resting state connectivity analysis . These results seem to confirm scenarios such as the ones shown in Figure 3 . 1 do occur in experimental data . Therefore , we feel that it is desirable to perform resting state 50 functional connectivity analysis in the latent neural space than with BOLD data so that the uncertainty introduced by the variability of the HRF is taken care of . The shape of the HRF is controlled by both non - neural and neural factors . The non - neural factors which impact the shape of the HRF include vasculature differences , baseline cerebral blood flow , hematocrit , alcohol / caffeine / lipid ingestion , partial volume imaging of veins , global magnetic susceptibilities , slice timing differences and pulse or respiration differences [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 47 ] . These factors induce HRF differences across both brain regions and subjects . Such differences seem to be random and will likely cancel out when we look at systematic differences between groups of subjects [ 47 ] . Therefore , the systematic differences in the shape of the HRF observed between ASD and controls are at least partly due to underlying neural factors that control the HRF shape . A comprehensive account of neural factors that control the shape of the HRF is beyond the scope of this report . However , we will discuss neurochemicals that have been shown to affect the shape of the HRF and then link them with independent reports of altered neurochemistry in Autism . Figure 3 . 8 shows various neurochemicals which control the coupling between neural activity and blood flow [ 4 ] . The demand for energy due to neural activity is coupled to blood flow changes by signaling pathways controlled by various neurochemicals that directly or indirectly mediate vasodilation or vasoconstriction . HRF is a mathematical transfer function which represents this coupling and hence could be altered as a consequence of changes in any of these neurochemicals . Specifically , glutamatergic and GABAergic interneurons impact the HRF [ 107 ] by releasing 51 neuromodulators which control local cerebral blood flow [ 108 ] [ 109 ] . In brain regions with low concentrations of GABA [ 110 ] , taller , quicker and narrower HRFs have been observed previously . Also , local activation of brain regions cause blood vessel dilation , which is mediated by glutamatergic actions on N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors [ 111 ] . Therefore , we concentrate on abnormalities in GABA , serotonin , nitric oxide ( NO ) and glutamate in ASD ( as indicated in Figure 3 . 8 ) . Figure 3 . 8 A schematic illustrating how various neurochemicals control the coupling between neural activity and blood flow . Abnormalities in GABA ( shown as 1 ) , nitric oxide ( shown as 2 ) , glutamate ( shown as 3 ) or serotonin ( shown as 4 ) in the ASD population may impact the shape of the HRF . The resting GABA concentration has been shown to be correlated with the amplitude of the hemodynamic response [ 112 ] [ 113 ] . We found that the bilateral inferior occipital gyrus and the 52 precuneus exhibited higher RH in the control group ( Fig 3 . 3A , Table 3 . 2 ) while the bilateral rectus , right inferior frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus ( Figure 3 . 3B , Table 3 . 2 ) exhibited higher RH in the ASD group . Reduced GABA concentration in the frontal lobe has been reported in individuals with ASD [ 114 ] . Also , down regulation of GABA receptors in the superior frontal cortex has also been previously found in autistic subjects [ 115 ] . This could potentially explain why disinhibition from reduced GABA might have led to higher RH in ASD in the frontal cortex . Another study showed that when a bumetanide treatment was applied to reinforce GABAergic inhibition in ASD patients , it resulted in the enhanced activation of brain regions involved in the social and emotional perception , including the inferior occipital cortex and the precuneus [ 116 ] . This supports the fact that we found increased RH in these regions , which might have been due to inadequate amount of GABA in the inferior occipital cortex and the precuneus . Muthukumaraswamy et al showed that the GABA concentrations were positively related with the width of HRFs [ 117 ] . In our study , the FWHM of the HRF in the frontal lobe was lower in the ASD group ( Figure 3 . 3C ) , in addition to reduced RH as discussed above , alluding to the possibility of lower GABA in the frontal lobe in ASD impacting FWHM of the HRF as well . The supramarginal gyrus ( BA 40 ) [ 118 ] , and parietal lobule [ 115 ] was reported to exhibit significant down - regulation of GABA receptors . Although the relationship between GABA receptors and GABA concentration is complex , they have been shown to be correlated [ 119 ] . 53 Serotonin is a vasoconstrictor that provides blood - brain barrier permeability [ 8 ] and plays a critical role in neurovascular coupling . The role of serotonin in controlling the shape of the HRF is complex given our lack of complete understanding of its production [ 120 ] , uptake [ 121 ] and reuptake [ 121 ] [ 122 ] . Altered serotonin levels have been confirmed in ASD [ 123 ] . The aberrant serotonin signaling pathways [ 124 ] , including aberrations in serotonin transporters [ 125 ] [ 126 ] , cortical serotonin synthesis [ 127 ] , and serotonin receptors [ 128 ] , have been reported in individuals with ASD , and could potentially lead to changes in HRF shape . The brain regions where these serotonergic aberrations were reported are also consistent with our results . For example , the precuneus ( BA31 ) ( Figures 3 . 3A , C , and E ) was reported to exhibit reduced serotonin transporters in ASD subjects [ 129 ] ; altered serotonin system was reported in the frontal cortex ( Figures 3 . 3B and C ) of animal models of ASD [ 130 ] ; the serotonin transporter binding in children with ASD was reduced in the frontal and temporal lobes ( Figures 3 . 3C and D ) [ 131 ] ; and the right lingual gyrus ( Figure 3 . 3E ) was indicated to be associated with the serotonin abnormalities in the ASD patients in an acute tryptophan depletion study [ 129 ] . It is noteworthy that the superior temporal gyrus [ 132 ] , and middle temporal gyrus [ 133 ] [ 134 ] are implicated in processing anxiety , which is an important symptom in ASD [ 135 ] . Concomitantly serotonergic alterations have been implicated in anxiety of humans as well as in animal models [ 64 ] [ 137 ] . Our result in fact reinforces this relationship . Nitric oxide is a vasodilator [ 138 ] , and its role in neurovascular coupling has been demonstrated before [ 139 ] . Aamand et al reported that the intake of dietary nitrate , which induced 54 a reduction of cerebral NO , was found to be related to alterations in the shape of the HRF [ 140 ] . A global increase in the level of NO has been implicated in the pathology of ASD [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] . Studies have confirmed that altered levels of NO are related to sensory - motor dysfunction [ 144 ] [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] , which is also an important symptom observed in ASD [ 148 ] [ 149 ] . We found larger FWHM of HRFs in the posterior parietal cortex and supramarginal gyrus of ASD patients ( Figure 3 . 3C ) . First , it is noteworthy that these regions are involved in sensorimotor [ 150 ] and somatosensory association functions [ 151 ] [ 152 ] [ 153 ] , respectively . Second , the above literature indicates that HRF alterations in sensorimotor regions , aberrations of NO and sensorimotor deficits in ASD may be related . Glutamate acts on astrocytes through glutamate receptors that are located on them . It triggers astrocytes to release several vasoactive messengers , which can either increase or decrease blood flow [ 9 ] . Therefore , aberrations in glutamate level and / or glutamate receptors on astrocytes could potentially alter neurovascular coupling and the shape of the HRF . Increased glutamate concentration [ 114 ] and abnormal glutamate receptor levels [ 154 ] have been demonstrated in subjects with ASD in the frontal cortex , and this could potentially contribute to alterations of HRF shape in the frontal cortex as observed by us ( Figure 3 . 3C ) . Aberrant astrocytic mechanisms [ 155 ] were also detected in the frontal lobe of autistic subjects . Since the precise relationship between glutamate concentration , glutamate receptor level and astrocytic expression remains unclear , it is difficult to provide a more mechanistic explanation of the effect of these neurochemicals and associated signaling pathways on HRF parameters . 55 Since the precuneus showed alterations in all three HRF parameters , we chose that region as the seed for functional connectivity analysis . It is noteworthy that precuneus is a core regions of the Default - Mode Network [ 156 ] [ 157 ] [ 158 ] [ 159 ] . Therefore , by using precuneus as the seed , in effect , we obtained the DMN in ASD and controls using both DC and NDC datasets . The between - group differences obtained from both datasets were largely consistent with those obtained from previous studies [ 98 ] [ 160 ] [ 161 ] [ 162 ] [ 163 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] . Since these functional network alterations in Autism have been well established and discussed in detail in these previous reports , we will not elaborate on them further here . However , it is noteworthy that deconvolved data showed additional regions in both within group and between - group comparisons ( Figures 3 . 5 and 3 . 6 ) . For example , the connectivity of the frontal lobe with the precuneus in the ASD group was detected in the DC but not the NDC dataset ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . Even when regions were identified using both DC and NDC datasets , the clusters obtained from the DC dataset tended to be larger in spatial extent ( Table 3 . 3 ) . Sometimes , this shifted the peak co - ordinates of the clusters . For example , right superior temporal was detected to be significantly and negatively correlated with the precuneus in the Control group in the NDC dataset ( Figure 3 . 5C ) , while in the DC dataset , the peak was found in the right insula ( Figure 3 . 5D ) . S . Zhang and C . shan R . Li [ 158 ] has examined the resting - state connectivity pattern of precuneus . Their result included the negative connectivity with bilateral insula and right supramarginal gyrus and positive connectivity with right middle temporal gyrus . Due to the confounds brought by HRF , these paths in control group were not detected in UDC dataset , then 56 it causes the confounds in detecting the altered path between groups . The right supramarginal gyrus has been found related to emotion processing [ 166 ] . In resting - state , it represents a hub in ventral attention network and less impaired in ASD in contrast to the default mode network [ 45 ] [ 167 ] [ 168 ] . The insula was emphasized in interoception and its abnormalities would cause affective symptom ( e . g . somatic complaints ) [ 169 ] . Together with precuneus , insula actives in self - attributional processes [ 170 ] . Since the negative correlation could be related to neural inhibition [ 171 ] [ 172 ] , we assumed the precuneus suppresses these regions during resting - state in control group , while in ASD group , we can’t observed these suppressions . A study reported that bilateral insula exhibit negative bias in interpreting interpersonal feedback [ 169 ] , this may be related to the loss of the negative bilateral insula - precuneus paths in ASD . Although no further explanation for negative right supramarginal gyrus - precuneus were found . These negative correlations are likely related to specific resting - state brain functions and reflecting the underlying pathology of ASD . The temporal cortex belongs to the subsystem of DMN , and could be related to retrieval of social semantic and conceptual knowledge [ 159 ] , which is also related to the symptoms of ASD . Therefore , the positive right middle temporal - precuneus is likely a byproduct of DMN and reflects unconscious brain function which impaired in ASD . Using repeated - measures ANOVA , we investigated whether brain regions show an interaction between group and deconvolution factors , i . e . whether significant differences between ASD and control groups are themselves significantly different between DC and NDC datasets . We found that the connectivity between the precuneus seed and the following regions – left medial frontal 57 gyrus , left cuneus , right angular gyrus and bilateral postcentral gyrus ( Figure 3 . 7 , Table 3 . 4 ) – showed this interaction effect . This shows that functional connectivity group differences in these regions would be inferred differently in DC and NDC datasets . This finding reinforces the point that we would be better off performing functional connectivity analysis in the latent neural space using NDC data than in BOLD space using raw data so that our inferences are not confounded by HRF variability . Finally , we present some limitations of this study and point towards future directions which could address those limitations . First , we estimated the effect of HRF variability using seed - based functional connectivity using a precuneus seed . We did this since the precuneus showed alterations in all three HRF parameters . However , one could investigate the effect of voxel - wise HRF variability on voxel - wise functional connectivity differences between controls and ASD at the whole brain level . Second , we have discussed various neurochemical alterations in ASD and how they could have influenced the shape of the HRF . These inferences are indirect at best , since we did not directly measure the concentration of those neurochemicals . Such an endeavor , using noninvasive in vivo methods such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy in humans as well as invasive methods in animal models , could provide evidence that is more direct and further validate our observations . 58 Chapter 4 Characterization of Hemodynamic Alterations in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder and their Effect on Resting - state Functional Connectivity Abstract Schizophrenia ( SZ ) and bipolar disorder ( BP ) have both common and distinct clinical symptomatology . Their neural bases have been explored using functional connectivity between brain regions using resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs - fMRI ) . However , fMRI is an indirect measure of neural activity and is modeled as a convolution of the hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) and latent neural activity . The HRF varies across both individuals and different brain regions within an individual . Consequently , it is plausible for two brain regions to appear synchronized in the BOLD space while being desynchronized in latent neural space and vice versa . In order to address this issue , we estimated voxel - specific HRFs by deconvolving rs - fMRI time series obtained from SZ ( N = 19 ) , BP ( N = 35 ) and matched healthy individuals ( N = 34 ) . The shape of the HRF was significantly different between the three groups in many regions previously implicated in SZ and BP . Specifically , we found voxels within the mediodorsal , habenular and central lateral nuclei of the thalamus to have HRFs with aberrations in all three of 59 its shape parameters : time to peak , response height and full width half max . Therefore , we defined this region as the seed , estimated seed - based functional connectivity maps in all three groups and characterized pairwise differences between them . Further , we performed a 2 - way ANOVA and estimated regions exhibiting an interaction between the group and deconvolution factors . Results indicated that functional connectivity differences between the groups are inferred significantly differently with raw BOLD and deconvolved latent neural time series . Since the variability of the HRF could be driven by both neural and non - neural factors , we feel that it is preferable to estimated functional connectivity using deconvolved data . Finally , we discuss the role of neurochemicals such as GABA , glutamate , serotonin and nitric oxide in controlling neurosignaling pathways underlying neurovascular coupling , and how previously documented alterations of these neurochemicals in SZ and BP could , at least in part , explain the significant differences in HRF shapes observed between the groups . Keywords : Resting - state fMRI , Deconvolution , Schizophrenia , Bipolar disorder , Hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) , Seed - based functional connectivity . 4 . 1 Introduction Schizophrenia ( SZ ) and bipolar disorder ( BP ) share significant overlap in clinical symptoms and neural characteristics [ 173 ] [ 174 ] [ 175 ] . SZ is a psychotic disorder characterized by altered perception , thought processes , and behaviors [ 176 ] ; while BP is a mood disorder involving prolonged states of depression and mania [ 177 ] . A popular noninvasive method for characterizing the neural basis of SZ and BP is resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs - fMRI ) 60 based on the blood - oxygen - level dependent ( BOLD ) contrast . A primary reason for the popularity of rs - fMRI is that it does not require the subjects to perform an explicit task , which can be difficult in clinical populations . Rs - fMRI also allows us to investigate interactions between neurophysiological events in spatially remote brain regions by assessing the temporal correlation of their respective BOLD signals [ 178 ] . This is often referred to as resting state functional connectivity . It is used to characterize large - scale brain networks both in healthy and clinical populations . Specifically , to date , a number of studies have employed rs - fMRI functional connectivity in order to understand both shared and distinct neural alterations in SZ and BP as compared with healthy controls . For example , resting state connectivity related to the medial prefrontal cortex [ 44 ] and the anterior cingulate [ 179 ] have been shown to be altered in both SZ and BP . On the other hand , Meda et al reported that the connectivity between fronto - premotor and meso / paralimbic networks were reduced only in SZ , while connectivity between fronto - temporal and paralimbic networks were increased only in BP [ 180 ] . Similarly , Chai et al [ 44 ] reported that the decoupling of functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and insula / ventral lateral prefrontal cortex distinguished BP from SZ . Despite much progress , the diagnostic value of these observations remains to be demonstrated using larger samples so that they can have predictive ability at the individual subject level . In spite of the understanding of the substrates underlying neurobiological differences between SZ , BP and healthy individuals gained from resting state fMRI , we highlight an under - appreciated issue in interpreting findings from rs - fMRI functional connectivity given that the fMRI blood 61 oxygenation level dependent ( BOLD ) contrast is an indirect measure of neural activity [ 46 ] [ 13 ] . The measured BOLD signal is considered as a convolution of the latent neural activity with a transfer function – the hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) [ 20 ] . The issue however is that the shape of the HRF has been shown to vary not only across subjects , but also across different brain regions in the same subject [ 47 ] [ 48 ] . Different factors contribute to this variability . First , it could be partly driven by differences in various neurochemicals ( and associated neurosignalling pathways ) controlling neurovascular coupling such as γ - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glutamate , serotonin and nitric oxide [ 4 ] . Second , it could be influenced by genetic factors [ 49 ] . Third , it could at least in part be driven by variability in non - neural factors such as baseline cerebral blood flow , vasculature differences , caffeine / alcohol / lipid ingestion , partial volume imaging of veins , hematocrit , pulse or respiration differences , global magnetic susceptibilities and slice timing differences [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] . Therefore , HRF variability could lead to two consequences : ( i ) It could confound functional connectivity estimates obtained from raw BOLD data . Specifically , raw BOLD data may appear to be synchronized when the underlying latent neural signals are not and vice versa [ 93 ] . ( Figure 4 . 1 ) and this is problematic when HRF differences between voxels / subjects are driven by non - neural factors ; ( ii ) HRF differences due to non - neural factors tend to be distributed randomly and when assessing systematic differences in HRF shape between clinical groups , differences in estimated functional connectivity may be driven by pathological alterations of neurochemicals controlling the neurovascular coupling ( and hence HRF shape ) in such groups . Specifically with reference to SZ and BP , prior studies have shown alterations in neurotransmitters 62 which control neurovascular coupling including GABA [ 58 ] [ 59 ] , nitric oxide level [ 63 ] [ 60 ] [ 181 ] [ 182 ] , serotonin [ 61 ] [ 183 ] [ 64 ] and glutamate [ 184 ] [ 185 ] [ 62 ] [ 65 ] , and this could potentially cause alterations in the shape of the HRF , . Figure 4 . 1 . The effect of HRF variability on Pearson’s correlation between two timeseries obtained from experimental fMRI data . The measured BOLD signal , the estimated HRF and the deconvolved BOLD fMRI ( or latent neural ) timeseries are shown in the top , middle and bottom rows respectively . We specifically illustrate two scenarios : ( A ) The acquired BOLD fMRI time series are highly correlated before applying deconvolution while the correlation between underlying latent neural signals is low , and ( B ) The acquired BOLD fMRI time series are uncorrelated before applying deconvolution while the correlation between underlying latent neural signals is high . Many deconvolution methods are capable of recovering latent neural activity and voxel - specific HRFs from the measured BOLD signal [ 20 ] [ 95 ] . The procedure is relatively straightforward for fMRI task paradigms because the timing of external events driving neural activity is known [ 72 ] [ 186 ] . For resting state , which lacks external sensory input and explicit time 63 of neural events [ 75 ] [ 96 ] , Wu et al . [ 75 ] proposed a deconvolution method to address this scenario and we have used it in the current work . The voxel - specified HRFs were obtained by deconvolving time series at the voxel - level and were characterized in terms of three parameters : time - to - peak ( TTP ) , response height ( RH ) , and full - width at half - max ( FMHW ) ( see Figure 4 . 2 ) . Figure 4 . 2 . Typical HRF with its three characteristic parameters . RH : response height ; TTP : time - to - peak ; FWHM : full - width at half max . In this work , we sought to identify brain regions which had systematic differences in HRF shape between SZ , BP and matched healthy control groups in an effort to identify differential neurovascular coupling mechanisms in these disorders . Further , we estimated resting state functional connectivity in both the latent neural and raw BOLD spaces in an effort to identify possible confounds introduced by the variable HRF in identified functional networks . 64 4 . 2 Materials and Methods 4 . 2 . 1 Participants The subject sample consisted of 38 patients satisfying DSM - IV criteria for SZ , 19 patients having BP with psychosis , and 35 matched healthy controls . Patients were recruited from the community - based mental health teams in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire , United Kingdom . The diagnosis was made in a clinical consensus meeting in accordance with the procedure of Leckman et al [ 187 ] . Subjects aged under 18 or above 50 , with neurological disorders , current substance dependence , or under - intelligence ( Intelligence Quotient score < 70 using Quick Test ) subjects were excluded . All patients were in a stable phase of illness , defined as a change of no more than 10 points in their Global Assessment of Function [ DSM - IV ] score and no change in stability of antipsychotic , antidepressant , or mood medications in 6 weeks prior to the study . Thirty - four healthy subjects , who are free of any psychiatric or neurological disorder and under - intelligence , were recruited from the local community via advertisements . The study was given ethical approval by the National Research Ethics Committee , Derbyshire , United Kingdom . All volunteers were given the written informed consent before scans . 4 . 2 . 2 Data Acquisition Subject were scanned on a 3 - T Philips Achieva MRI scanner ( Philips , the Netherlands ) , using an 8 - channel SENSE head coil with SENSE factor 2 in anterior - posterior direction . To enhance sensitivity , dual - echo gradient - echo echo - planar images ( GE - EPI ) were acquired [ 188 ] with sequence parameter setting as : TE1 / TE2 25 / 53 ms , flip angle 85 degrees , 255 mm × 255 mm field 65 of view , with an in - plane resolution of 3 mm × 3 mm and a slice thickness of 4 mm , and TR of 2500 ms . At each dynamic time point , a volume data set was acquired consisting of 40 contiguous axial slices acquired in descending order , a total of 410 dynamic time points during an entire session , with 2 sessions per subject . An anatomical image was also acquired for each participant . 4 . 2 . 3 Pre - processing The data was preprocessed by using Statistical Parametric Mapping ( SPM8 ) [ 100 ] and Data Processing Assistant for resting - state fMRI [ 101 ] . After an initial correction for slice - timing differences , spatial realignment to the first image was carried out . Participants were excluded if movement parameters exceeded 3 mm . An interpolation method , Art Repair [ 189 ] , was used to correct movement artifacts . A single weighted summation of the dual - echo dynamic time course was obtained for each subject [ 190 ] , followed by retrospective physiological correction using RETROICOR [ 191 ] . Unified segmentation based on spatial normalization , and smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM were carried out . Following this , linear detrending was performed to eliminate low frequency fluctuations and high frequency noise . Finally , variance accounted for by six head motion parameters and the global mean signal , were removed by regression . In order to reduce respiratory and cardiac effects , the white - matter signal and CSF ( cerebro - spinal fluid ) signal were also regressed . At this point , the pre - processing pipeline was split into two different pipelines . In the first pipeline , no further processing was done and the pre - processed data was designated as the non - deconvolved ( NDC ) dataset . In the second pipeline , an 66 additional deconvolution step using the method proposed by Wu et al . [ 75 ] was performed voxel - wise and the resulting data with voxel time series representing latent neural signals was designated as the deconvolved ( DC ) dataset . Finally , both DC and NDC dataset were temporally bandpass filtered in the ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 Hz ) range . 4 . 2 . 4 Blind Deconvolution and HRF Estimation We applied a blind deconvolution technique developed for resting state fMRI by Wu et . al . [ 75 ] to retrieve latent neural signals as well as estimate voxel - specific HRFs . This method is based on modeling peaks in the resting - state BOLD signal as a response to spontaneous neuronal events [ 103 ] [ 192 ] . The HRF which best models the observed BOLD signal as its convolution with the underlying pseudo - random neural events is searched over a range of biologically plausible delays . Then , the voxel - specific HRFs and the latent neural signals were estimated from the raw BOLD signal using Weiner deconvolution [ 20 ] . The shape of the voxel - specific HRF was characterized using three easily interpretable parameters : response height ( RH ) , time to peak ( TTP ) , and full width half max ( FWHM ) ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . 4 . 2 . 5 Seed Region Selection In order to investigate the effect of HRF variability on functional connectivity , we set out to estimate seed - based functional connectivity using DC and NDC datasets . In order to do this , we wanted to identify seed regions whose HRF shape was different in all the three groups . For each of the three HRF parameters , two sample two - tailed t - tests were conducted in three comparisons separately : SZ vs control , BP vs control , and SZ vs BP . In each comparison , maps that indicate 67 voxels showing significant ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 , cluster - size > 50 ) differences in three HRF parameters were obtained . This resulted in 6 maps ( SZ < control , SZ > control , BP < control , BP > control , SZ < BP , and SZ > BP ) per parameter and 18 maps overall . The regions identified in the intersection of all the 18 maps had altered HRF parameters in every comparison . We found only the thalamus in this intersection and hence was defined as the seed region of interest ( seed ROI ) . 4 . 2 . 6 Seed - based Functional Connectivity For each participant , the mean time series within the thalamus seed ROI was obtained . The functional connectivity between the thalamus seed and the remaining voxels in the brain were evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the mean time series of the seed ROI and the time series extracted from the rest of the voxels in the brain . The correlation coefficients were transformed by Fisher ' s z - transform to improve the normality [ 104 ] [ 105 ] . The converted z - score maps are hereafter referred to as “the correlation maps” . This pipeline was implemented separately for the two datasets : ( i ) NDC : data pre - processed without deconvolution , and ( ii ) DC : data pre - processed with deconvolution . 4 . 2 . 7 Group - level Analyses For each group , the z - score maps from individual subjects were entered into a random effects one - sample t - test to determine voxels whose connectivity with the thalamus seed were significantly greater than zero . Subsequently , the correlation maps from individual subjects were also entered into a random effects two - sample t - test to identify brain regions showing significantly different connectivity with the thalamus seed ROI in three comparisons separately ( SZ vs control , 68 BP vs control , and SZ vs BP ) . These procedures were also implemented separately for both DC and NDC datasets . 4 . 2 . 8 The Effect of Deconvolution With the aim of investigating the effect of deconvolution on between - group differences in functional connectivity , we performed a two - way repeated - measures ANOVA using SPSS ( version 20 , IBM Inc . , USA ) software . In this analysis , the groups ( SZ , BP , and Control ) were considered as one factor and data with / without deconvolution as the other factor . We then identified the voxels showing a significant interaction between the two factors ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 , cluster size > 40 voxels ) . 4 . 3 Result 4 . 3 . 1 Between - group HRF Differences In the SZ vs control comparison , we found that the bilateral thalamus , midbrain and precuneus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) wider FWHM ( Figure 4 . 3A ) in the SZ group while the bilateral cerebllum posterior lobe , left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral precentral gyrus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) wider FWHM ( Figure 4 . 3A ) in the control group . The right anterior cingulate cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) higher RH ( Figure 4 . 3A ) in the SZ group while the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe , posterior cingulate , precuneus and lingual gyrus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) higher RH ( Figure 4 . 3A ) in the control group . The bilateral midbrain had 69 significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) longer TTP ( Figure 4 . 3A ) in the SZ group while the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) longer TTP ( Figure 4 . 3A ) in the control group . In the BP vs control comparison , we found that the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) wider FWHM ( Figure 4 . 3B ) in the BP group while the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe , left middle temporal gyrus and bilateral precentral gyrus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) wider FWHM ( Figure 4 . 3B ) in the control group . The bilateral anterior cingulate cortex , bilateral cingulate gyrus , bilateral medial frontal gyrus , and right supramarginal gyrus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) higher RH ( Figure 4 . 3B ) in the BP group while the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe , bilateral cerebellum anterior lobe , bilateral thalamus and bilateral medial frontal gyrus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) higher RH ( Figure 4 . 3B ) in the control group . The bilateral cingulate gyrus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) longer TTP ( Figure 4 . 3B ) in the BP group while the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe , left middle temporal gyrus , and bilateral middle frontal gyrus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) longer TTP ( Figure 4 . 3A ) in control group . In the BP vs SZ comparison , we found that the bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) wider FWHM ( Figure 4 . 3C ) in the BP group while the bilateral thalamus , cerebellum anterior lobe and midbrain had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) wider FWHM ( Figure 4 . 3C ) in the SZ group . The bilateral medial frontal gyrus , left 70 lingual gyrus , bilateral posterior cingulate and bilateral inferior parietal lobule had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) higher RH ( Figure 4 . 3C ) in the BP group while the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) higher RH ( Figure 4 . 3C ) in the SZ group . The bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) longer TTP ( Figure 4 . 3C ) in the BP group while the bilateral pons and thalamus had significantly ( FDR corrected p - value < 0 . 05 ) shorter TTP ( Figure 4 . 3C ) in the BP group . Detailed information such as cluster sizes , cluster centroids etc . are shown in Table 1 . 71 Figure 4 . 3 Spatial maps showing regions with significantly different HRF parameters in the three comparisons : ( A ) SZ vs Control , ( B ) BP vs Control , and ( C ) BP vs SZ . 72 Table 4 . 1 .

Sagittal ( x = 2 ) , and axial ( z = 4 ) views are shown in standard MNI space . In the thalamus seed ROI , alterations in HRF parameters exhibited the following pattern : FWHM : SZ > Control ; RH : BP < Control , and FWHM : SZ > BP . ( B ) The overlap of our thalamic seed ( shown in white ) with thalamic zones as described in the Oxford thalamic atlas [ 193 ] . Accordingly , diffusion tractography from the seed showed highest probability of structural connectivity with the temporal and pre - frontal lobes . ( C ) The overlap of our thalamic seed ( shown in white ) with thalamic nuclei described in the Morel thalamic atlas [ 194 ] [ 195 ] . The seed encompasses the mediodorsal nucleus , habenular nucleus and the central lateral nucleus . We found that a thalamic cluster showed significant alterations in all three HRF parameters ( Figure 4 . 4A ) . Note that in the identified thalamus seed ROI , the alterations in HRF parameters exhibited the following pattern : FWHM : SZ > Control , RH : BP < Control , and FWHM : SZ > BP . The overlap of our thalamic seed ( shown in white , Figure 4 . 4B ) with thalamic zones as described in the Oxford thalamic atlas [ 196 ] indicated that diffusion tractography from our seed showed 75 highest probability of structural connectivity with the temporal and pre - frontal lobes . By registering our seed ROI on the digital 3D Morel atlas [ 194 ] [ 197 ] , we found that the thalamic seed ROI encompasses the mediodorsal ( MD ) nucleus , habenular ( Hb ) nucleus and the central lateral ( CL ) nucleus ( Figure 4 . 4C ) . 4 . 3 . 2 Thalamus - based Functional Connectivity within Groups In the control group , the thalamus exhibited only positive functional connectivity with other brain regions .

We employed a blind deconvolution procedure to estimate voxel - specific HRFs and demonstrate that brain regions , many of which are implicated in the pathology of SZ and BP , are characterized by HRFs whose parameters – RH , FWHM and TTP – are significantly different between the groups . One such regions , the thalamus , exhibited aberrations in all three HRF parameters between all three groups . Consequently , we calculated thalamic seed - based functional connectivity before and after deconvolution in order to characterize distortions of functional connectivity introduced by such spatial variability of the HRF when connectivity is estimated from raw BOLD data . 95 The variability in the shape of the HRF across brain regions and subjects due to non - neural factors tend to be more randomly distributed [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 91 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] and would tend to cancel out when comparing different populations . On the other hand , pathological alterations in neurochemicals tend to introduce more systematic differences in the shape of the HRF between groups . Specifically , Figure 4 . 13 shows a schematic of neurovascular coupling mechanisms which are controlled by specific neurochemicals such as GABA , serotonin , glutamate and nitric oxide ( NO ) [ 4 ] . The signaling pathways involving these neurochemicals couple the energy demand caused by neural activation to blood flow changes by mediating vasoconstriction or vasodilation . Specifically , GABAergic and glutamatergic interneurons release neuromodulators which could control local cerebral blood flow [ 200 ] , and hence the HRF [ 201 ] . Glutamate causes dilation of blood vessels when brain regions are locally activated and this mechanism is mediated by its actions on N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors [ 111 ] . Quicker , taller , and narrower HRFs have been observed in regions with lower concentrations of GABA [ 117 ] . Below , we discuss previous literature showing alterations of these chemicals in SZ and BP groups and speculate on how such alterations might have resulted in HRF changes we have observed . 96 Figure 4 . 13 A schematic illustrating the hemodynamic coupling between neural activity and blood flow . The HRF is a mathematical function which represents this neurovascular coupling mechanism . The aberrations of neurochemicals in SZ and BP subjects which may impact neurovascular coupling and hence the shape of the HRF are shown . Abnormalities in GABA are shown as 1 , serotonin is shown as 2 , nitric oxide is shown as 3 , and glutamate is shown as 4 . The resting GABA concentration is correlated with the amplitude of the hemodynamic response [ 112 ] [ 113 ] . As mentioned before , quicker , taller , and narrower HRFs have been observed in regions with lower concentrations of GABA [ 117 ] . Reduced GABA in anterior cingulate cortex has been reported in SZ [ 202 ] , which could result in higher RH in this region ( Figure 4 . 3A ) . Decreased GABA level was reported in the medial frontal lobe in older SZ patients [ 203 ] , which could explain lower FWHM we observed in this region . Further , postmortem studies linking molecular deficits with in vivo observations in SZ patients [ 204 ] have reported reduced glutamic 97 acid decarboxylase , a synthetic enzyme for GABA , in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [ 205 ] , primary motor cortex ( BA 4 ) [ 206 ] , and hippocampus [ 207 ] . We have detected shorter FWHM in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and primary motor cortex ( BA 4 , Precentral Gyrus ) , and higher RH in parahippocampus , which reinforce the relationship between GABA and the shape of HRFs . The altered expression of GABA receptors also suggests altered GABA concentration ; however , their precise mechanistic relationship is unclear . Unlike SZ , relatively fewer studies have investigated neurochemical alterations in BP . For example , a higher GABA concentration was reported in anterior cingulate cortex [ 208 ] , which could produce an HRF with wider FWHM in this region ( Figure 4 . 3B ) . Also , reduced protein expression of the GABA receptor was reported in cerebellum [ 209 ] , which may be related to the lower RH , FWHM and TTP we found in BP ( Figure 4 . 3B ) . More studies are needed to investigate neurochemical alterations in BP and further elucidate possible mechanisms by which they could explain HRF alterations in this population . Serotonin is a powerful vasoconstrictor [ 8 ] and hence has the potential to affect the shape of the HRF . However , unlike GABA , less is known about how serotonin impacts HRF parameters . Previous studies have detected aberrations of the serotonergic system both in SZ [ 61 ] [ 183 ] [ 210 ] [ 211 ] and BP [ 64 ] [ 211 ] [ 212 ] [ 213 ] populations . In the SZ group , several aspects of serotonin expression were altered in the cerebellum , including mRNA , protein and binding sites of serotonin gene [ 214 ] . The serotonin binding site densities were reported to be significantly increased in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex , and parahippocampal gyrus ; 98 and the serotonin receptor mRNA abundance was reported to be reduced in dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate [ 215 ] . There findings might be related to the altered HRF shape observed by us in these regions ( Figure 4 . 3A ) . In the BP group , the mean serotonin transporter binding potential was reported to be aberrant in the thalamus , dorsal cingulate cortex , medial prefrontal cortex [ 216 ] and anterior cingulate cortex [ 217 ] . These aberrations could potentially alter the HRF shape in these regions ( Figure 4 . 3B ) . Glutamate tigers astrocytic activation , which can release a number of vasoactive molecules to regulate vascular tone , including vasodilation and vasoconstriction [ 9 ] . Therefore , the aberrant glutamate level and the dysfunction of glutamate receptors on astrocytes could disrupt normal neurovascular coupling and give rise to altered shape of the HRF . In SZ , higher expression of glutamate transporters [ 218 ] and decreased glutamate receptor binding [ 219 ] had been demonstrated in the thalamus . Increased subunit mRNA expression of NMDA glutamate receptors was found in the prefrontal lobe [ 220 ] . Postmortem studies have reported increased expression of glutamate transporters in the dorsolateral prefrontal [ 221 ] and anterior cingulate cortices [ 221 ] [ 222 ] . In the BP group , absolute concentrations of glutamate was observed to be significantly higher in the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal lobe [ 223 ] . Elevated thalamic N - acetylaspartate , a reservoir for glutamate , was reported in males diagnosed with BP [ 224 ] . Decreased mRNA expression of glutamate transporters has been reported in the medial temporal lobe of participants with BP [ 225 ] . Taken together , previously reported alterations of the glutamatergic system in SZ and BP , could in principle , alter HRF shape in the corresponding 99 regions ( Figure 4 . 3 ) . Nitric oxide modulates neurovascular coupling as a vasodilator [ 138 ] [ 139 ] . In the SZ group , increased nitric oxide synthase have been reported in cerebellum [ 226 ] , a region which also showed altered HRF shape in our study ( Figure 4 . 3 ) . For the BP group , literature on regional alterations of NO are sparse . However , the contribution of NO to the pathology of BP was confirmed by Savas et al [ 227 ] . We detected a cluster of voxels within the thalamus ( Figure 4 . 4A ) that showed significant differences in the HRF parameters across all three groups . According to the Morel thalamic atlas [ 194 ] [ 195 ] , the thalamus seed we have used encompasses the MD nucleus , the Hb nucleus and the CL nucleus ( Figure 4 . 4C ) . Diffusion tractography studies have suggested a high probability of structural connections between caudodorsal MD nucleus and medial frontal / cingulate cortex as well as dorsolateral frontal cortex [ 228 ] . CL nucleus was shown to be connected with the basal ganglia in animals [ 229 ] [ 230 ] [ 231 ] . Although reports of specific connections from the human CL nucleus were not to be found , the intralaminar nucleus , which includs the CL nucleus , was reported to be connected to the basal forebrain , cerebral cortex , basal ganglia , sensori - motor cortex , and hypothalamus by a diffusion tensor tractography study in humans [ 232 ] . Also , by registering our thalamic seed on the Oxford thalamic atlas based on diffusion tractography [ 193 ] ( Figure 4 . 4B ) , we found that the strucutral connections from our thalamic seed with the temporal and pre - frontal lobes showed the highest probability . Kumar et al [ 233 ] proposed a thalamic parcellation based on both rs - fMRI functional connectivity and structural connectivity of the thalamus . They compared 100 their parcellations with the Morel atlas as well [ 194 ] [ 195 ] . They reported that their parcellated thalamic clusters which overlapped with MD and CL thalamic nuclei exhibited notable differences in their structural as well as functional connectivity with the rest of the brain . Direct and indirect tracts from MD and CL were reported to be confined to the posterior fornix , precuneus , posterior cingulum , hippocampus including the parahippocampal gyrus , subthalamic nucleus and brainstem . On the other hand , rs - fMRI functional connectivity analyses by Kumar et al reported that MD and CL were functionally connected at rest with the occipital and parietal lobes , the temporoparietal junction , pre - and postcentral gyrus , cuneus , inferior and medial temporal lobe , the anterior cingulate , and parts of the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex . The Hb nucleus has been shown to be structurally connected to both the limbic system and key brainstem nuclei [ 234 ] [ 235 ] . Literature indicates that the Hb nucleus may act as a hub between forebrain and midbrain regions . The connectivity of the cerebellum and the thalamus is complex . The thalamus receives major projections from the cerebellum [ 236 ] [ 237 ] and different thalamic nuclei mediate the relationship between the cerebellum and different parts of the cortex [ 238 ] [ 239 ] [ 240 ] . The ventral lateral thalamic nuclei that receive projections from the deep cerebellar nuclei [ 241 ] through three distinct routes . The direct route passes in the anterolateral direction under the thalamus and enters from the ventral side . The second route following the posterior pathway turns dorsally from the midline at the posterior side of the thalamus , entering the thalamus from various positions . The third route following the anterior route passes laterally in the subthalamus and enters the external medullary lamina . Within the lamina , fibers turn posteriorly and enter the dorsal side of the thalamus [ 242 ] . 101 Divergent pathways originate from the same axon but travel different routes and target different terminal fields . Previous studies also reported aberrations in thalamic connectivity in SZ [ 243 ] [ 244 ] [ 245 ] [ 246 ] [ 247 ] and BP [ 247 ] [ 248 ] similar to those found by us and we will not elaborate on them further here . Taken together , these patterns of connectivity between the MD , CL and Hb thalamic nuclei and the rest of the brain , as well as those between the cerebellum and thalamus found in previous studies are in general agreement with functional connectivity obtained from our thalamic seed in controls , as well as observed aberrations of such functional pathways in SZ and BP disorders . It is noteworthy that the group connectivity patterns were different between DC and NDC data ( Figures 4 . 5 , 4 . 6 , 4 . 7 ) . In some instances , although similar overarching regions were identified with both DC and NDC data , the size and peak co - ordinates of some clusters were shifted . In other instances certain between - group differences of functional connectivity were observed only in the DC dataset . For example , aberrant connectivity between the thalamus and right caudate in SZ and BP group were detected only in the DC dataset ( Figure 4 . 11A ) but not in the NDC dataset ( Figure 4 . 11B ) . This makes sense given that the caudate is structurally connected specifically with the MD nucleus in the thalamus [ 249 ] [ 250 ] which was part of our thalamic seed . Finally , we applied repeated - measures ANOVA to investigate whether brain regions show an interaction between deconvolution and group factors . We found that the interaction effect was exhibited in the functional connectivity paths between the thalamus seed and the following regions : bilateral lingual gyrus , bilateral insula and bilateral superior frontal gyrus ( Figure 4 . 11 , Table 4 . 9 ) . 102 This implies that the connectivity differences across the groups between the thalamic seed and these regions would be deduced differently in the NDC and DC datasets . This finding suggests that if the estimated functional connectivity should be interpreted purely in terms of the underlying neural metabolism rather than in terms of non - neural and neural ( such as neurovascular signaling mechanisms ) components affecting the HRF , then it would be preferable to characterize functional connectivity in the latent neural space rather than the raw BOLD space . The limitation of this study is that we investigated the effect of HRF variability only on thalamus - seed based connectivity pattern in the three groups . However , a similar analysis at the whole brain level , though computationally expensive , may provide a more complete picture . Also the discussion we provided regarding how the neurochemical factors might affect the shape of the HRF is still speculative . In the absence of direct measurement of neurochemicals ( using in vivo MR spectroscopy , positron emission tomography or single - photon emission computed tomography ) in regions showing alterations in the shape of the HRF , it is not possible to make definitive claims regarding how these neurochemicals might control different aspects of the HRF shape . 103 Chapter 5 Enhancing Creativity and Insight using fMRI Neurofeedback Abstract The neural correlates of creativity , specifically insight , is a matter of intense interest . Insight problem - solving is not deduced logically and the solution is typically very hard to get ( probability of success approximates 0 % [ 40 ] ) and requires “out of the box” thinking . By using the transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , Chi et . al . [ 66 ] demonstrated that increasing the excitability of the right anterior temporal lobe ( rATL ) mitigated cognitive biases and enabled surprisingly large number of people to solve insight problems such as the nine - dot puzzle . Here we test this hypothesis using real - time fMRI ( rt - fMRI ) based neurofeedback under the premise that if subjects are enabled to up - regulate activity in their rATL using neurofeedback , it must mimic the effect of tDCS and hence enable them to solve the problem . Our results show that approximately 40 % of subjects were able to solve the nine - dot problem using rt - fMRI neurofeedback , which is similar to the percentage of subjects who were able to solve the puzzle using tDCS as reported by Chi et al . Subjects who solved the puzzle were able to significantly up - regulate activity over their rATL as compared to those who did not . Further , the rATL was predominantly driven by other ( specifically , frontal ) regions in unsuccessful subjects while it predominantly drove other regions in successful 104 subjects . The frontal regions are likely involved in top - down modulation ( which impose cognitive biases while solving problems ) of temporal regions , forcing individuals to see a Gestalt , i . e . a square bounding box for the nine dots , which likely prevents them from “thinking out of the box” . Therefore , up - regulation of activity in rATL will likely mitigate this bias . Furthermore , our study demonstrates that neurofeedback could potentially be used to mimic effects similar to brain stimulation techniques such as tDCS . This provides a likely framework for cross - pollination between brain stimulation and neurofeedback paradigms . Key works : Insight Problem Solving ; Real - time fMRI ; Effective Connectivity ; Dynamic Granger Causality . 5 . 1 Introduction Insight problem solving is generally characterized by a time interval wherein it does not appear to the subject that he / she is progressing towards the solution in a logical step - by - step manner , followed by a rapid arrival to the solution . Consequently , the subject is not able to trace back on how he / she arrived at the solution , and the solution simply appears to occur to them from nowhere . This creates a subjective “aha ! ” experience for the subject [ 251 ] . Human creativity is thought to follow the framework outlined above for insight problem solving , although all creative expressions are not necessarily borne out of the necessity to solve a problem . Therefore , creativity has a broader context and insight problem solving is a specific instantiation of the creative thought process . Although insight problem solving shares common underlying cognitive processes ( e . g . memory retrieval , decision - making , categorization , and perception ) with most other types of 105 solving strategies , it differs from common problem solving in that the key to generating the solution is conceptual restructuring rather than analytical thinking . Specifically , Ohlsson [ 252 ] suggested that the insight problem solving is best described as “impasse followed by restructuring” . During insight problem solving , the solvers try to minimize the difference between the current state of problem solving and the goal state . Insight occurs only when the solver realizes that the following analysis steps couldn’t achieve the goal and that a new analysis must be sought . With the development of neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and electroencephalography ( EEG ) , investigations into the neural basis of insight problem solving and creativity have characterized brain activations throughout the solving period . Accumulated evidence indicates the dominant involvement of the right hemisphere in insight problem solving [ 253 ] [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] . Many have theorized that insight problem solving involves several component processes [ 258 ] [ 259 ] [ 260 ] [ 261 ] . Accordingly , many have tried to explain insight problem solving in terms of two cognitive processes separately . Breaking the mental set [ 262 ] [ 263 ] or cognitive restructuring is considered as one of the key processes . A mental set is defined as the tendency to solve problems in a fixed way based on previous solutions to similar problems [ 264 ] . Therefore , breaking the mental set is defined as the moment when the subject realizes that the solution requires different methods and tries to move away from the current mental set . Another important process is forming novel associations , which refers to associating existing concepts or skills in novel ways based on current task demands [ 265 ] . Existing empirical evidence does not allow for any systematic conclusion that isolates the neural correlates of these 106 two processes . However , experimental paradigms that emphasize one process over another could provide the neural basis of these two processes and reveal different parts of insight problem solving . Ding et al [ 266 ] suggest that the cingulate gyrus may be involved in detecting conflict and breaking mental set , middle and inferior frontal gyrus may play an important role in cognitive restructuring , and inferior parietal lobule , and the superior temporal gyrus may be associated with forming novel association . Qiu et al [ 267 ] required participants to find the solution on their own initiative during solving Chinese logogriphs , and suggested that the precuneus might be involved in retrieval of heuristic information , left inferior / middle frontal cortex might be related to breaking the mental set and forming novel associations . Regions within the temporal cortex have been consistently identified as essential for creativity and insight problem solving . Specifically , superior temporal gyrus in the right anterior temporal lobe ( rATL ) has been highlighted because EEG data revealed a sudden burst of high - frequency ( gamma - band ) neural activity in rATL prior to the emergence of insight solutions [ 255 ] . Other studies have revealed an increased fMRI signal in the right anterior superior temporal gyrus for insight but not non - insight solutions [ 255 ] [ 262 ] . Taking cue from these results , Chi et al [ 66 ] applied transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) to inhibit the activation of left anterior temporal lobe ( lATL ) and facilitate the activation rATL , while participants were engaged in solving an inherently difficult insight problem called the nine - dot puzzle [ 268 ] . They showed that tDCS enabled a surprisingly large number of people ( 40 % ) to solve the nine - dot puzzle while the probability of an individual solving the nine - dot puzzle without tDCS is close to zero [ 40 ] . The 107 nine - dot problem requires that nine dots be arranged in a square connected by four straight lines drawn without lifting the pen from the paper and without retracing any lines ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . This problem is ridiculously simple in the formal sense that there are only a few possible solutions to try , but ridiculously difficult in the psychological sense that the probability of success approximates 0 % [ 40 ] . The explanation for this phenomenon is because our brains , especially the left hemisphere , are wired to interpret the world though the filter of our past experiences , and we are inclined to see the nine - dots as a square , with imposed rigid boundaries . This mechanism is mostly unconscious and cannot be easily overridden . In Chi’s study [ 66 ] , they showed that tDCS enabled a surprisingly large number of people ( 40 % ) to solve the nine - dot puzzle while the probability of an individual solving the nine - dot puzzle without tDCS is close to zero [ 40 ] . Figure 5 . 1 The nine - dot problem and its solution . Inspired by this work , we hypothesized that real - time functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rt - fMRI ) neurofeedback [ 34 ] can mimic the effects of tDCS and enable individuals to solve the The nine - dot puzzle Solution 108 nine - dot puzzle . Specifically , when an individual is solving the nine - dot puzzle inside an MRI scanner , we extracted the signal from the participant’s rATL and provided that as a feedback to the participant in near real - time . The participant was required to adopt strategies for solving the nine - dot puzzle which increased the rATL feedback signal . We hypothesized that this will mimic the excitatory effects of tDCS on rATL and enable about 40 % of the subjects to arrive at the solution . Further , using brain connectivity modeling , we contrast brain networks obtained from individuals who solved the puzzle versus those who did not , providing putative neural mechanisms underlying creativity and insight problem solving Rt - fMRI neurofeedback allows participants to selectively regulate their own brain activity by gaining volitional control over the BOLD signal from specific regions of their own brains provided as a feedback [ 34 ] [ 35 ] . The self - regulation of brain activity has been achieved in various regions , e . g . , the anterior cingulate cortex for pain control [ 36 ] , the amygdala for the emotional regulation of fear [ 37 ] , etc . The learned control over the local brain activity via rt - fMRI neurofeedback training were also demonstrated to lead to specific changes in behavior [ 34 ] [ 35 ] . However , our proposal to use rt - fMRI as a non - invasive proxy for brain stimulation is novel . Finally , using post - hoc analysis of task data , we investigated brain regions differentially activated in individuals who were successful in solving the puzzle with the aid of neurofeedback versus those who were unsuccessful . Further , we also characterized the underlying directional brain networks in these groups of participants in order to understand the role of top - down inputs into the rATL in enhancing or suppressing creative insight . 109 5 . 2 Methods 5 . 2 . 1 Participants The sample consisted of 26 healthy participants ( 13 women , 13 men ) , aging from 22 - 28 years ( averaged age : 24 . 8 years ) . Participants had no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders and were compatible to be scanned in an MRI scanner . Further , they were interviewed before recruitment to make sure that they had not heard of the nine - dot puzzle and did not know the solution to the puzzle a priori . The research protocol was approval by the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) at Auburn University . All subjects provided written informed consent . Three participants were excluded due to unacceptable data quality . The analyzed data consisted of 10 participants who solved the nine - dot puzzle and 13 participants who did not . 5 . 2 . 2 Experimental Design Protocol Participants were informed that they would receive a neurofeedback signal that represents the activation of a specific region of their own brain throughout the scans . The BOLD signal from the rATL region was shown to the participants as an increasing / decreasing curve . The participants were instructed to attempt to solve the nine - dot problem by pursuing strategies that will enhance the neurofeedback BOLD signal . A button box was given to the participants and they were asked to press a specific button when they thought that they had arrived at the solution . This was done in order to record the moment in time when the participants solved the puzzle and the scanning continued irrespective of the button press . 110 The experimental paradigm consisted of 4 runs per subject . Each run had 300 TRs ( TR = 2s ) in total . The block design consisted of 10 TRs of rest followed by 20 TRs of task , which repeated throughout the whole run , as depicted in Figure 5 . 2 . Figure 5 . 2 fMRI block design consisted of rest blocks ( 10 TR ) and task blocks ( 20TR ) alternating each other . Each run consisted of a total of 300 TRs ( TR = 2s ) . During the task blocks , participants attempted to solve the puzzle while receiving neurofeedback , and were asked to adopt strategies that increased the neurofeedback signal . Behavioral report Before the scan , the subjects were instructed as following : ( 1 ) Try to solve the problem when the color of line turns red and a word of “task” shows up ( Figure 5 . 3 ) . ( 2 ) Rest when the color of line turns blue and a word of “rest” shows up ( Figure 5 . 3 ) . ( 3 ) During solving the problem , try to increase the changing curve which represents the increasing activity in rATL ( Figure 5 . 3 ) . ( 4 ) Hit the button box right after they think they have solved the problem . ( 5 ) After hitting the button box , keep thinking the problem , check the answer ( because their answer could be wrong ) , and continues controlling the curve . The button box could be hit for multiple times if they think the new solution is right . ( 6 ) We will check the answer and time of right solution appearing with them after each run . 111 After each run , the subjects were pulled off the scanner . We checked the following questions with subjects : Whether they have the solution ; Whether the solution is right ; how many times they had hit the button and which one is the time they had the right solution ? Especially after first and second runs , the subject were asked about their performance of mastering the instruction . We asked them that whether they have actual rest during the rest block , and whether they have the feeling of they can control the curve . After four runs , we talked with the subjects . In successful group , the subjects exhibited comprehension of the whole task . Most of them stated that when they focus on insight problem solving , the curve goes up very easily . When they try to think about something else , such as music , movies , the curve goes down quickly . And most of them stated that they felt they started generating control to the curve in second and third run . In unsuccessful group , most subjects stated they didn’t feel that they have acquired the ability in managing the curve . Also , they couldn’t build the connection of their problem solving with the changing of curve . 112 Figure 5 . 3 The screenshot of feedback image provided to the subjects . ( A ) A screenshot during the rest block . The blue line and a blue word of “rest” are provided to remind subjects for resting . ( B ) A screenshot during task block . The red line and a red word of “task” are provided to remind subjects of performing task . A picture of nine dots is provided at the left button of screen for reminding the problem to subjects . The changing image is adjusted to fit the size of screen automatically . 5 . 2 . 3 Real - time Data Acquisition The subjects were scanned in a 7T Siemens MAGNETOM scanner . For each subject , a high - resolution anatomical scan was acquired using a magnetization - prepared rapid gradient echo ( MPRAGE ) sequence with repetition time ( TR ) = 2200 ms , echo time ( TE ) = 2 . 9 ms , inversion 113 time ( TI ) = 105 ms , flip angle ( FA ) = 7° , number of slices = 256 , slice thickness = 0 . 7mm , and field of view ( FOV ) = 224mm . After the anatomical images were collected , functional images were acquired by using an echo - planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence with TR = 1500 ms , TE = 25 ms , number of slices = 32 , voxel size = 3 . 0×3 . 0×3 . 0 mm 3 , FOV = 192 mm , flip angle = 70° , and 300 measurements . A 32 - channel head coil ( Nova Medical ) was used . During each scan , after on - line reconstruction of the data , the images were sent to a computer ( Figure 5 . 4 C ) where the data was subjected to accelerated motion correction as described in Scheinost et al [ 269 ] and temporal denoising by using the Yale BioImage Suite software [ 270 ] ( www . bioimagesuite . org ) . The feedback signal was selected from a pre - defined ROI of rATL ( central MNI coordinates : x : 45 ; y : - 9 ; z : - 47 ) and displayed to the subject as a changing curve via Avotec’s MR - compatible projection system . The BioImage Suite software package has the ability to process data in near real - time . The time lag between actual brain activity and the display of feedback signal was under 2s . The system architecture is illustrated in Figure 5 . 4 . 114 Figure 5 . 4 The experimental setup for real time fMRI which consisted of ( A ) The 7T MRI scanner , ( B ) Scanner host computer , ( C ) Image processing computer , and ( D ) Display computer with projector . The raw k - space MR data were processed by the reconstruction system on the scanner host computer , which creates images of each slice / volumes . The image processing computer retrieved slices / volumes from the scanner host computer and analyzed slices / volumes in real time by using BioImage Suite software . Its output was the fMRI signal from the rATL ROI which was sent to the display computer to be shown to the subject as a curve . When the curve goes up ( or down ) , it represented increased ( or decreased ) brain activity . 5 . 2 . 4 Image Processing before Biofeedback Scans The rATL ROI was defined in MNI space . In each scanning session , after the anatomical images were collected , the rATL ROI was pre - transformed from the MNI space to the functional space of the given subject using three concatenated transformations ( Figure 5 . 5A ) . Firstly , the rATL ROI was transferred from MNI space to the given subject ' s MPRAGE image by applying nonlinear registration ( Figure . 5 . 5B ) . Secondly , axial adjustment of rATL ROI was performed by applying a linear rigid transformation to the space of the given subject’s axial - oblique anatomical data [ 271 ] ( Figure . 5 . 5C ) . Lastly , the structural images of rATL ROI were registered to the 115 individual’s functional space by applying a linear rigid transformation ( Figure 5 . 5D ) . All transformations were performed by using appropriate modules of the Yale BioImage Suite software package , including “combine transformations” , “linear registration” , “linear RPM” etc . [ 270 ] . In this manner , the rATL ROI was translated into the functional space of each participant before the neurofeedback scans involving four EPI runs . 116 Figure 5 . 5 Illustration of the registration of the normalized rATL mask into the space of subject’s functional space . ( A ) The normalized rATL mask as defined on the MNI space . ( B ) The transformed ( via a nonlinear registration ) rATL mask in the space of the subject ' s high - resolution structural data . ( C ) The transformed rATL mask in the space of the subject ' s axial - oblique anatomical data . ( D ) The transformed rATL mask in the space of the subject ' s axial - oblique functional reference space . 117 5 . 2 . 5 On - line Real - time fMRI Process In this system , the on - line rt - fMRI image processing was implemented by modifying the image reconstruction pipeline of Siemens ' Image Calculation Environment ( ICE ) [ 269 ] . More specifically , a new local “functor” was inserted in the online processing chain , immediately after each slice of the image was acquired and reconstructed by scanner host ( Figure 5 . 4 B ) and before the scanner host sent image to real - time system ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . This “functor” wrote the slice image as a file in a directory accessible to a separate image processing computer ( Figure 5 . 4 C ) connected by local area network . Since the strategy of real - time fMRI is minimize the delay of processing raw image associated with standard offline methods . The image processing computer applied “image analysis program” ( a module of BioImage Suite : www . bioimagesuite . org ) to accelerated the motion correction in real - time . The system takes advantage of the interleaved acquisition of fMRI ( where the odd - numbered slices are acquired first followed by the even - numbered slices ) . The image processing computer ( Figure 5 . 4C ) read and stored the slices in local memory as they appeared . When all the odd slices had arrived , the “image analysis program” computed a linear rigid transformation between the incoming data and the functional reference volume . Once the complete volume had arrived , the computed transferred function was applied to transform the given volume into the space of the functional reference volume . Through this manner , the accelerated motion correction would be achieved . The average signal in the rATL ROI was then computed and sent to the display computer ( Figure 5 . 4D ) via serial port . In the display computer , the stimulus / neurofeedback presentation was executed . 118 5 . 2 . 6 Offline Pre - processing Pre - processing was performed offline using the Data Processing Assistant ( DPARSF ) toolbox [ 99 ] based on Statistical Parametric Mapping ( SPM8 ) software package [ 100 ] . The first five images were discarded to ensure the equilibration of magnetization . The images were preprocessed separately for each subject with the following steps : slice timing correction by shifting the signal measured in each slice relative to the acquisition of the slice at the mid - point of each TR , realigning of all the images using six rigid body parameters ( registered to the first image and then registered to the mean of the images after the first realignment ) in order to correct for motion . For every individual , the functional images were co - registered to the structural images ( T1 - weighted MPRAGE ) by using a linear transformation as well as spatially normalized to the MNI avg152 T1 template , in MNI stereotaxic coordinates . The functional images were spatially smoothed with a 2 mm 3 full - width at half - maximum ( FWHM ) Gaussian smoothing kernel [ 272 ] . Head motion effects and low frequency scanner drifts were regressed out from the fMRI signal by utilizing a 24 - parameter ( 6 head motion parameters , 6 head motion parameters one time point before , and the 12 corresponding squared items ) model [ 102 ] . The signals from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid were regressed out to reduce respiratory and cardiac effects . 5 . 2 . 7 Offline Analysis of fMRI Task Data As mentioned above , the experimental paradigm required participants to adopt problem solving strategies that would up - regulate the BOLD signal extracted from the rATL region of their own brains and provided as a neurofeedback signal during the task blocks . We predicted that this 119 would enable the subjects to solve the nine - dot problem . In order to understand the neural basis of success or failure in solving the nine - dot problem , we estimated the incremental task - induced BOLD signal change in the rATL across runs . For each run and subject , the preprocessed BOLD signal was abstracted from the rATL ROI mask used during neurofeedback in the data acquisition phase . The signal changes in rATL averaged over individual task blocks relative to the baseline was computed individually for each subject on a trial - by - trial basis . More specifically , the incremental percentage BOLD signal change was computed by using the following equation : ∆signal = mean ( task ) −mean ( rest ) mean ( rest ) ×100 % ( 5 . 1 ) Furthermore , a linear regression analysis that used the trial - specific signal changes as the dependent variable and time as the independent variable was conducted to evaluate the learning effects over time . The increment of corrected T2 * - weighted images during regulation with respect to the baseline was evaluated by using SPM8 . Voxels showing significant positive changes during task blocks with respect to the baseline were inferred to be activated . This resulted in statistical contrast maps showing activated regions for each participant separately . In order to understand the neural basis of success or failure in solving the nine - dot problem , we divided the sample into two groups – those who were successful in solving the nine - dot problem and those who were not . In the current study , 10 subjects solved the nine - dot problem and were designated as the ‘successful group’ , while 13 subjects did not solve the nine - dot problem were defined as the ‘unsuccessful group’ . The statistical contrast maps from individual were input into a random - effects one - sample t - test to 120 assess group - level activation maps separately in both the groups . The statistical contrast maps from individual subjects in both the groups were also compared directly using a random - effects two sample t - test . The between - group activation differences were examined using the following contrasts : successful group > unsuccessful group and unsuccessful group > successful group . The location of activated clusters ( in MNI coordinates ) at a significance level of p < 0 . 05 FDR corrected was determined . 5 . 2 . 8 Offline Analysis of Effective Connectivity Networks ROI Definition We aimed to examine the patterns of connectivity between brain regions involved in solving the nine - dot puzzle and investigate differential connectivity patterns in individuals who were successful in solving the puzzle as compared to those who were not . We selected 9 ROIs activated by the task and identified by the GLM analysis described above . Among these , 5 ROIs were activated in the successful group > unsuccessful group contrast and 4 ROIs were activated in the unsuccessful group > successful group contrast . All ROIs were cubes of 5 mm per side , centered on the peaks of activation . Dynamic Granger Causality ( DGC ) Analyses The concept underlying Granger causality ( GC ) [ 78 ] [ 78 ] to forecast the future of one signal “S 1 ” by using the past and present of another signal “S 2 ” [ 78 ] [ 273 ] [ 274 ] [ 275 ] . A successful prediction is inferred as a causal influence from S 2 to S 1 . The causal influences between multiple time series can be inferred by using a multivariate vector autoregressive model ( MVAR ) 121 [ 276 ] [ 277 ] . In neuroimaging , the time series are obtained from activated brain regions . In this way , the MVAR model can be used to infer causal relationships between activated ROIs in brain networks [ 274 ] [ 278 ] [ 279 ] [ 280 ] . The advantage with this approach is that it is data driven and does not require specification of candidate models as in dynamic causal modeling and structural equation modeling [ 275 ] . When using this approach in a block or event - related fMRI paradigm , it is necessary to be able to distinguish causal influences between activated ROIs during events of interest from those obtained from inter - trial intervals or control conditions . In order to achieve this , the MVAR model can be made ‘dynamic’ by allowing the model coefficients to vary across the time . Let us assume k ROI time series from k activated brain regions as follows : 𝑋 ( 𝑡 ) = [ 𝑥 1 ( 𝑡 ) , 𝑥 2 ( 𝑡 ) , ⋯ , 𝑥 𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) ] ( 5 . 2 ) The dynamic MVAR model [ 81 ] [ 281 ] is then given by : 𝑋 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐴 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝐴 ( 1 , 𝑡 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑡 − 1 ) + ⋯ + 𝐴 ( 𝑝 , 𝑡 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑡 − 𝑝 ) + 𝐸 ( 𝑡 ) ( 5 . 3 ) Where the dynamic model coefficients A are a function of both time t and model order p . It is to be noted that in A ( 0 , t ) , diagonal elements representing auto - correlation were set to zero and only cross - correlation between time series were modeled in order to compensate for zero - lag correlation effects ( referred to as correlation - purged Granger causality ) [ 282 ] . The model coefficients were then estimated in a Kalman filter framework using variable parameter regression [ 82 ] , which calculates the optimal set of coefficients that minimizes the model error E ( t ) [ 283 ] . The coefficient A ′ ( p , t ) indicates the degree to which the past X ( t − p ) can predict the 122 present X ( t ) , where p is an arbitrary time delay or model order [ 83 ] . The sum of all coefficients corresponding to all delays at time t would be represented as : 𝐷𝐺𝐶 𝑖𝑗 ( 𝑡 ) = ∑ 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 𝑝𝑛 = 1 ( 𝑛 , 𝑡 ) ( 5 . 4 ) Where a ij are the elements of coefficient matrix A . In this framework , DGC ij represents dynamic Granger causality and is the strength of causal relationship from ROI i to ROI j at time instant t [ 284 ] . In this study , in order to examine the causal relationships arising from neural delays less than a TR [ 285 ] [ 286 ] , we used a first order model by choosing the model order p as 1 . The time series to be used in the model described above were obtained from ROIs which were activated in the successful > unsuccessful as well as unsuccessful > successful contrasts ( more on this in the results section ) . Before performing DGC analysis , deconvolution was performed on the average time series extracted from each of the ROI identified in the above contrasts separately for each run and each participant . Inter - subject and spatial variability of the hemodynamic response function ( HRF ) [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 91 ] could lead to false inferences of directional connectivity . This can be addressed by applying hemodynamic deconvolution , wherein the variability of the HRF and its smoothing effect can be minimized so that directional connectivity is more accurately estimated [ 53 ] [ 287 ] [ 93 ] . We performed deconvolution to obtain latent neuronal variables by using a blind deconvolution algorithm [ 72 ] , which jointly estimates latent neuronal time series as well as ROI - specific HRF [ 288 ] [ 289 ] based on the Cubature Kalman filter [ 290 ] [ 291 ] [ 292 ] . Further , it has been demonstrated that this model likely does not overfit the data [ 186 ] . The estimated latent neural 123 time series from each ROI were put into the MVAR based DGC model to estimate directional connectivity between the ROIs at each time point . The DGC values associated with task blocks and rest blocks ( Figure . 5 . 1 ) were extracted for each path and each individual subject separately [ 293 ] . Then , the task - related DGC values were collated into two different samples corresponding to subjects from the ‘successful group’ and the ‘unsuccessful group’ . Connectivity paths significantly ( p - value < 0 . 01 , FDR corrected ) different between the groups were evaluated by comparing the task - specific connectivity samples obtained from the two groups using two sample t - tests . The connectivity paths which were significantly stronger in the successful group and vice versa were examined . In successful group , the DGC values were also extracted in male subjects and female subjects . The altered path between genders were examined ( p - value < 0 . 01 , FDR corrected ) by performing two sample t - tests between the task - specific connectivity samples obtained from the male subjects and female subjects in successful group . In these contrasts , the DGC matrixes acquired from the timeseries after the occurrence of solution in successful group were not put into the analysis . In successful group , we also extract the DGC values form the 10 task timepoints ( 22 seconds ) before the generation of the solution and the 10 task timepoints ( 22 seconds ) after the generation of solution . Connectivity paths significantly ( p - value < 0 . 01 , FDR corrected ) were evaluated . The complete workflow of DGC analysis is depicted in Figure 5 . 6 . 124 Figure 5 . 6 An illustration of the workflow of DGC analysis . After deconvolution , the estimated latent neural activity of each ROI were input into the dynamic MVAR model . The significantly different ( p - value < 0 . 01 , FDR corrected ) paths in the contrasts of successful group > unsuccessful group , unsuccessful group > successful group were calculated by comparing the task - related DGC values between two group . In successful group , the contrast of 10 task timepoints before solving the problem between after solving the problem and the contrast between genders were calculated by comparing the task - related DGC values . 5 . 3 Result 5 . 3 . 1 The rt - fMRI Neurofeedback Signal Regulation As mentioned before , 10 subjects were successful in solving the nine - dot puzzle while 13 subjects were not . The percentage of participants who solved the puzzle ( 43 . 5 % ) is surprisingly similar to the percentage of participants who solved with puzzle with tDCS applied to rATL [ 66 ] . The amount of percentage signal increase in rATL that the subjects were able to achieve in each of the four runs is shown in Figure 5 . 7 for both the successful and unsuccessful groups . The average BOLD activity in the rATL increased progressively across the neurofeedback runs for the successful group and reached a maximum during the final neurofeedback run ( run 4 ) ( Figure 5 . 7 , 125 blue line ) . For the unsuccessful group , the average BOLD activity in the rATL failed increase significantly beyond the first run and decreased precipitously from run - 3 to run - 4 ( Figure 5 . 7 , red line ) . The percent BOLD signal change was significantly larger in the successful group as compared to the unsuccessful group only in run - 4 ( Figure 5 . 7 , asterisk ) . These results demonstrate the ability of the participants in the successful group to upregulate BOLD activity over their rATL region via rt - fMRI neurofeedback while the unsuccessful group clearly failed to do so . Given that all subjects reached the solution in run - 4 , our results indicate that more that 60 % signal change in rATL may be required to gain creative insight . Since we examine the general performance of regulating rATL , and the subjects didn’t stop regulation after the get the solution ( cause its accuracy was not check ) , this analysis includes all the time series of run 4 in successful group . A repeated measures ANOVA was performed to examine the interaction between group and BOLD signal change . We considered the 4 runs as different measurements and group as a factor . The significant interaction between runs and group was found in Sphericity assumption ( Table 5 . 1 ) . 126 Figure 5 . 7 Percentage BOLD signal change within each run and associated changes across runs ( run - 1 to run - 4 ) for both the successful group that solved ( blue ) and the unsuccessful group that did not solve ( red ) the puzzle .

No stronger connectivity paths were found in the connectivity of 10 task timepoints after the generation of solution . 135 Figure 5 . 14 Paths which showed significantly stronger connectivity in the 10 task timepoints before generation of solution as compared with the 10 task timepoints after generation of solution in successful group ( p < 0 . 01 , FDR corrected ) . 5 . 4 Discussion The primary goal of this study was to demonstrate that rt - fMRI neurofeedback - based self - regulation of brain activity could mimic the effects of tDCS by facilitating a significant number of individuals in solving the nine - dot puzzle [ 66 ] . Specifically , we applied rt - fMRI neurofeedback by extracting the signal from rATL . This choice was inspired by previous EEG experiments that demonstrated a sudden burst of high - frequency ( gamma - band ) neural activity in rATL prior to the emergence of insight solutions [ 255 ] and the tDCS study that demonstrated that excitatory 136 stimulation over rATL could facilitate insight problem - solving [ 2 ] . In our work , 10 subjects solved the problem and 13 subjects did not ( i . e . approximately 40 % were successful ) . This result is in agreement with Chi’s study [ 2 ] , where 40 % individuals solved the problem with the facilitation of tDCS . Thus , we concluded that self - regulation of brain activity via rt - fMRI neurofeedback could mimic the effects of tDCS . In order to understand the neural mechanisms underlying enhanced insight problem - solving and creativity with rt - fMRI neuroffedback from rATL , we performed post - hoc analysis of the data in both the groups . For the successful group , we selected the data only from individuals who solved the problem . All such subjects did so only in the fourth run . The unsuccessful group consisted of data from subjects that completed 4 runs ( to ensure that the individuals undergo rt - fMRI neurofeedback for approximately the same duration ) , but did not solve the puzzle . The successful group showed progressively enhanced up - regulation of the rATL signal from first to fourth runs while the unsuccessful group did not . Moreover the difference in percent signal change over rATL was significant between the groups in the fourth run when the subjects in the successful group arrived at the solution ( Figure 5 . 7 ) . Post - hoc activation analysis revealed that the successful group exhibited higher activations in rATL , lATL , lAG , rIFG and rSFG ( Figure 5 . 8 ) . On the other hand , the unsuccessful group exhibited higher activations in lSFG , CauH , rSPG and rSOG ( Figure 5 . 9 ) . Since both groups performed the same task of solving nine - dot problem , these detected regions could be involved in various mental processes underlying creativity and insight problem solving . These detected brain 137 regions are generally consistent with previous studies . A number of neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the increased activations of the bilateral temporal cortex ( rATL [ 255 ] [ 262 ] [ 294 ] and lATL [ 295 ] [ 296 ] ) during insight problem solving . The rATL was shown to be recruited before the moment at which the solution to insight problems arose [ 255 ] . The exact role of lATL in creativity and insight problem solving remains to be determined . However , recent findings suggest that lATL could be involved in retrieving and maintaining heuristic information obtained during the learning stage [ 297 ] , which is necessary for all types of problem solving . The bilateral frontal cortices have also been implicated in insight problem solving [ 298 ] [ 261 ] [ 260 ] [ 299 ] . The prefrontal cortex has been shown related to the successful execution of mental processes which are required for creativity and insight problem solving ( e . g . suppressing extraneous thoughts , selecting prepotent solution strategies and shifting attention from a non - prepotent strategy ) besides others [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 300 ] [ 301 ] [ 302 ] . The prefrontal cortex is not thought to be directly involved in generating creativity and insight . Rather , it is considered to contributes to the instigation of the creative thoughts by enabling the recognition of appropriately novel combinations of information [ 260 ] , thereby aiding the breaking of conceptual constraints . There are appears to be lateral specificity in the frontal cortex . For example , the right hemisphere of the frontal cortex was found to be involved in formulating distant semantic relations [ 303 ] . This supports theories that the right hemisphere is involved in the processing of distant associations that may be useful in creative thought and problem solving [ 253 ] [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] . This is in line with higher activation in rSFG and rIFG in the successful group ( Figure 5 . 8 ) in our results . 138 We also detected other active regions in both groups . Higher activation of lAG was found in the successful group ( Figure 5 . 8 ) . The activation of lAG has been shown to be related to problem solving [ 304 ] [ 305 ] [ 306 ] and mental arithmetic [ 307 ] . Dandan et al concluded that the lAG might be involved in forming novel associations between insight problems and related prototypes [ 308 ] . On the other hand , higher activation was found in CauH in the unsuccessful group ( Figure 5 . 9 ) . The CauH is a core region of the non - declarative memory system [ 309 ] [ 310 ] , and its activation could be related to potential mnemonic strategies that might have been used by unsuccessful participants [ 311 ] [ 312 ] . Higher activation was also found in rSOG in the unsuccessful group ( Figure 5 . 8 ) . rSOG is implicated in visual processing [ 267 ] . Given that Salvi et al demonstrated that sudden insight is associated with shutting out of visual inputs [ 313 ] , it makes sense that we found higher activation of rSOG in the unsuccessful group . Higher activation was also found in rSPG in the unsuccessful group ( Figure 5 . 9 ) . Recently , increasing number of studies have reported the activation of parietal lobe [ 255 ] [ 299 ] could serve broadly in associative processing [ 314 ] [ 315 ] , which facilitated creativity thinking . However , a study instructed participants to generate either creative or uncreative stories and found that creative ( as compared to uncreative ) story generation was associated with lower activity in right parietal lobe [ 316 ] . Combined with the lower activation of rSPG detected in the unsuccessful group in our result , we proposed the idea that the rSPG could be recruited in creative task , but less devotion is required in generating the creative solution . Our results demonstrated that rt - fMRI neurofeedback not only facilitated the subjects to up - regulate the activation of targeted brain region ( rATL in our case ) , but also to alter brain 139 connectivity associated with the targeted region [ 34 ] [ 35 ] . Enhancement of activity in a single targeted region could propagate to other regions connected to the targeted region , either increasing or decreasing activity in those regions . Therefore , we hypothesized that connectivity associated with rATL would be significantly different between the groups . Specifically , we hypothesized rATL to predominantly receive inputs from other regions in unsuccessful subjects . This is based on previous literature speculating that top - down modulation of temporal regions by frontal regions imposes cognitive biases [ 317 ] [ 318 ] [ 319 ] which inhibits creativity and insight problem solving . On the other hand , in successful participants , we hypothesized that rATL would predominantly drive other regions and escape the top - down cognitive biases . Our results indeed support the above hypothesis . We found that rATL and lAG drove rSFG , rSPG and the CanH in the successful group ( Figure 5 . 10 ) while it was driven by rSFG , rIFG and lATL ( Figure 5 . 11 ) in the unsuccessful group . We also found that before the generation of the solution , the rATL particularly drives the lATL , lAG , rSFG ( Figure 5 . 14 ) . This result is highly consistent to the EEG data that revealed a sudden burst of high - frequency ( gamma - band ) neural activity in rATL prior to the emergence of insight solutions [ 8 ] . In summary , the frontal regions are likely involved in top - down modulation ( which impose cognitive biases while solving problems ) of temporal regions , forcing individuals to see a Gestalt , i . e . a square bounding box for the nine dots , which likely prevents them from “thinking out of the box” . Therefore , up - regulation of activity in rATL will likely mitigate this bias . Also , the activity in rATL is especially important in generating the solution . 140 Our result also indicates that the cognitive pattern under problem solving is likely different between genders . In female , the lAG drives other regions ( Figure 5 . 12 ) while in male , the rSPG drives other regions ( Figure 5 . 13 ) . As mentioned above , lAG has been shown to be related to mental arithmetic [ 307 ] and parietal lobe [ 255 ] [ 299 ] could serve broadly in associative processing [ 314 ] [ 315 ] . This result may reflect the cognitive bias between genders . In conclusion , our study demonstrates that neurofeedback could potentially be used to mimic effects seen in brain stimulation techniques such as tDCS in facilitating insight problem solving and enhancing human creativity . This provides a potential framework for cross - pollination between brain stimulation and neurofeedback paradigms . 141 Chapter 6 Conclusion and Future Work 6 . 1 Conclusion This dissertation aims to propose novel signal processing methods and experimental paradigms with fMRI applications , which devotes to the strategies of decoding brain signals and states . The conclusions are summarized as follows : Study 1 and study 2 : Most rs - fMRI connectivity analyses were conventionally applied to the raw BOLD signal , which ignored the confounding effect raised from the varied HRF . Previous discussions proposed HRF deconvolution methods to acquire neural - space signal and concluded that it is better to use neural - space signal for inferring causality on hidden neural activity [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] . In the light of these works , we continued the discussion into rs - fMRI connectivity analysis . We hypothesized that the systematic differences in the shape of the HRF could be examined between these pathological populations and healthy controls , and the varied HRF would contribute to the differences in estimating functional connectivity in the BOLD space as compared to the latent neural space . Since the aberrant non - neural factors that would control the HRF shape was well - stablished in ASD [ 47 ] , SZ [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] and BP [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] , 142 we verified the proposed hypotheses on the three pathological populations . By applying a novel deconvolution method which copes with varied HRF , we acquired the voxel specific HRF and latent neural event in these pathological populations and healthy control group . In study 1 , we identified the brain regions which had systematic differences in HRF shape between these ASD and control groups . Specifically , we detected a cluster in precuneus exhibited aberrations in all HRF parameters . Further , we examined and compared the precuneus - seed - based functional connectivity differences between ASD and controls in BOLD space as well as latent neural space and the fMRI data processed without deconvolution failed to detect group differences in connectivity . In study 2 , we observed brain regions showed differences in HRF shape between SZ , BP and control subjects , and detected a cluster within the mediodorsal , habenular and central lateral nuclei of the thalamus that exhibited pairwise altered HRF shape between the three populations . We evaluated the thalamic seed - based functional connectivity maps in BOLD space as well as latent neural space . In both studies , our results indicated that the pairwise functional connectivity differences between the groups were inferred significantly different in BOLD space and latent neural space . Moreover , we performed two - way ANOVA analyses in study 1 and 2 , and the interaction between group and deconvolution factors was demonstrated in estimated regions . This shows that functional connectivity group differences in these regions would be inferred differently in DC and NDC datasets . Together , our results demonstrated that the possible confounds introduced by the variable HRF in identified functional networks in pathological populations , especially in the populations 143 that share overlapped pathology in the neurotransmitters which also control HRF shape . We reported that raw fMRI data might have failed to detect group differences in rs - fMRI connectivity analysis and emphasized the importance of performing HRF deconvolution method in rs - fMRI connectivity analysis . Moreover , our results are relevant for the understanding of hemodynamic and neurochemical aberrations in ASD , SZ , and BP . Study 3 : Present researchers have demonstrated that the activity in right - sided rATL is crucial in generating “Aha ! ” experience in insight problem solving [ 255 ] . However , the elaborated mechanism remains unclear . Our work aimed to find a way to approach insight with novel neuroimaging techniques and experimental paradigms . By introducing rt - fMRI neurofeedback technology , we mimicked the facilitated effect of tDSC [ 66 ] on solving nine - dot puzzle . Consequently , the increased number of subjects who solved the problem is in line with the stimulus effect of tDSC . Also , the successful solved group exhibited better capability in self - regulation the brain activity in rATL . Since the enhancement of activity in a single targeted region could mediate its connection with other regions , we further investigated the underlying neuronal connectivity . Our results demonstrated that rt - fMRI neurofeedback not only facilitated the subjects to up - regulate the activation of targeted brain region ( rATL in our case ) , but also to altered brain connectivity associated with the targeted region [ 34 ] [ 35 ] . Our results indicated that the up - regulation of activity in rATL are likely to mitigate the top - down modulation of temporal regions by frontal regions imposing cognitive biases [ 317 ] [ 318 ] [ 319 ] , which inhibits creativity and insight problem solving . 144 To sum it up , we characterized the underlying directional brain networks in these groups of participants in order to understand the role of top - down inputs into the rATL in enhancing or suppressing creative insight . We have demonstrated that insight solutions are indeed associated with a discrete , distinct pattern of neural activity , supporting unique cognitive processes . Moreover , our study demonstrated that neurofeedback could potentially be used to mimic effects seen in brain stimulation techniques such as tDCS in facilitating insight problem solving and enhancing human creativity . This study provided a potential framework for cross - pollination between brain stimulation and neurofeedback paradigms . 6 . 2 Limitations and Future work We here present some limitations of this dissertation and point towards future directions which could address those limitations . In study 1 and study 2 , we only estimated the effect of HRF variability in functional connectivity by using the estimated seeds . However , one could investigate the effect of voxel - wise HRF variability on voxel - wise functional connectivity differences between controls and pathologic populations at the whole brain level . Second , we have discussed various neurochemical alterations in pathologic populations and how they could have influenced the shape of the HRF . These inferences are indirect at best , since we did not directly measure the concentration of those neurochemicals . Such an endeavor , using noninvasive in vivo methods , such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy in humans as well as invasive methods in animal models could provide evidence that is more direct and further validate our observations . 145 In study 3 , we mimicked the facilitated effect of tDSC over rATL on solving nine - dot puzzle [ 66 ] . However , in Chi’s research [ 66 ] , they investigated the stimulation targeted on rATL , the inhibition targeted on lATL and the integrated effect of both . The further study should also investigate the self - generated inhibition over lATL and integrated effect based on rt - fMRI technology . 146 Bibliography [ 1 ] S . Ogawa , T . M . Lee , A . S .
