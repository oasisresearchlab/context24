RES EAR CH A RT I C LE Open Access Physicians reading and writing practices : a cross - sectional study from Civil Hospital , Karachi , Pakistan Muhammad Farhan Khaliq * , Muhammad Muslim Noorani , Uzair Ahmed Siddiqui and Maheen Anwar Abstract Background : To determine the behavior of physicians regarding medical literature reading and participation in research activities at one of the largest teaching hospitals in Pakistan . Method : This descriptive , cross - sectional study was conducted by interviewing the house officers , residents and fellows of six major specialties ( Medicine , Surgery , Pediatrics , Psychology , Obstetrics & Gynecology and Anesthesia ) in Civil Hospital , Karachi between August and December , 2011 . The questionnaire elicited responses regarding the reading habits of physicians , preferred sources of information , their participation in research activities ( publication & supervision ) and views regarding journal club . SPSS 17 . 0 was used for data entry and analysis . Result : A total of 259 completely filled questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 85 . 19 % . Mean age of the participants was 29 . 67 ± 7 . 65 years . Books were selected by 71 . 4 % doctors as their preferred source of information , regardless of their clinical specialties . ( p < 0 . 05 ) . E - journals were preferred by 75 . 7 % of the doctors over printed journals . This holds true for doctors from all specialties ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The ease of searching for relevant articles was the major contributor ( 50 . 5 % ) in preference of e - journals . 137 ( 52 . 9 % ) doctors read 5 or less articles per week . 30 ( 11 . 6 % ) doctors have subscription of journals ( printed or electronic ) . At least one research paper has been published by 151 ( 58 . 3 % ) of the physicians interviewed . Most common reason for not participating in research activities was busy schedule ( 56 . 4 % ) . Almost half ( 49 . 4 % ) doctors reported lack of journal club in their units . Of these , majority ( 88 . 35 % ) wanted a journal club in their respective units . Conclusion : Urgent intervention is required to promote healthcare literature reading and writing practice in our physicians . Easy access to workplace computers with internet and subscription of paid journals will facilitate physicians . Lack of supervisors and busy schedule were reported to be important contributors for not participating in research . Addressing these issues will encourage doctors to participate more in research activities . Keywords : Sources of information , Up to date , Research , Literature reading , Journal club , Developing country , Pakistan , Karachi , Civil hospital Background The last few decades have witnessed a tremendous up - surge in biomedical research . It is estimated that 6 - 7 % of new information is inculcated per annum , doubling the information in ten to fifteen years [ 1 ] . These facts neces - sitate thorough scrutiny of biomedical research before it can be used to alter the existing medical practice . The literature reading habits of doctors are influenced by various factors such as the professional age , location and size of their primary hospital , the type of practice and the specialty to which they belong [ 2 ] . The time lim - itations imposed by a hectic schedule warrants clinicians to study medical literature based on practical relevance [ 3 , 4 ] . Reading and writing medical literature contributes to the development of critical thinking which is an import - ant trait for the practicing clinicians [ 5 ] . Unfortunately , in Pakistan , doctors have attached more emphasis to - wards clinical practice with little input in the field of re - search [ 6 ] . The causes implicated for this trend are lack of time and infrastructure , financial constraints , lack of * Correspondence : muhammadfarhankhaliq @ gmail . com Dow Medical College , Dow University of Health Sciences , Civil Hospital , 203 Shan Plaza , Gawali Lane No . 3 , Ratan Talao Near Urdu Bazar , Karachi , Pakistan © 2012 Khaliq et al . ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd .

In the recent years , however , efforts have been made to inculcate research culture into clinical practice with the requirement of having two publications in journals indexed by Index Medicus , by College of Physicians and Surgeons , Pakistan ( CPSP ) [ 8 ] . Publishing articles has also been made mandatory by CPSP for doctors , for ascending to the next level in ten - ure system . The recent years have also witnessed increased involvement of medical students and fresh graduates towards medical research [ 9 ] . There is a very little literature which represents the reading habits of doctors of public sector hospitals in Pakistan . This study was carried out to observe what measures doctors take to keep themselves updated with new medical literature and their involvement in research activities . Methods Study setting This descriptive study was conducted between August to December 2011 at Civil Hospital Karachi ( CHK ) which is a 1900 bed tertiary health care centre . It is one of the largest teaching hospitals of Pakistan where more than 1400 doctors are employed as house officers , residents and fellows in 21 specialties . Study population and data collection The sample size was calculated with the assumption that 50 % of doctors read medical literature and are involved in research activities . A sample size of 304 was obtained at 95 % confidence interval and 5 % margin of error . For the study sampling , the 21 specialties were sorted into 6 major groups . These groups were categorized as Medi - cine ( which included Internal Medicine , Dermatology , Neurology and Cardiology ) Surgery ( which included General Surgery , Neurosurgery , Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology ) , Pediatrics , Anesthesiology , Gynecology & Obstetrics and Psychiatry . The study protocol was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board of Dow Uni - versity of Health Sciences . The questionnaire was constructed after a pilot study in which 30 random doctors were included . These doc - tors were provided with open ended questionnaires . The results of these questionnaires were analyzed and were used to design it . should be : It also included pertinent questions as indicated by other studies and suggestions from faculty members of community medicine depart - ment . Written consent was obtained from participating doctors and a self - administered questionnaire was pro - vided to them . The study participants were assured of the confidentiality of their data . The participants were requested when they were given the questionnaires , to complete and return them at the same moment . When this was not possible , cell phone numbers of participants were noted and the forms were collected from them later . A database of the participants was constructed which included the name of participant , their respective department and serial number of the form of participant . Study instrument The self - administered questionnaire consisted of five sections . Section one dealt with participant demograph - ics . It had questions regarding age , education level ( house officer , post - graduate trainee or training com - pleted ) , teaching status and their unit . Section two con - sisted of questions regarding reading habits of participants . This sections had questions regarding sources of information used , literature reading frequency and language preference ( English or native language ) . Preference for journal content was asked . The partici - pants were also questioned about the location where they studied literature . Another question aimed to deter - mine reasons of not reading literature from those who had indicated this in their responses . Section three dealt with e - journals . The participants were asked whether they preferred e - journals over printed journals and reasons were elicited for the same . They were asked about the sources of literature they read online and the last time they searched for an article over the internet . Section four investigated the research related activities of the participants . It had questions about the number of articles each participant had pub - lished and supervised . Those participants who were not involved in any research related activity , were asked the reason for being so . Section five dealt with determining journal club activity in units of participants . In those units which had no journal club activity , participant opinion on starting one was asked . Statistical methods Statistical Package for Social Sciences Windows version 17 was used for database assembly and analysis . Only those questionnaires were included which were com - pleted . Descriptive analysis ( means , standard deviations and percentages ) was performed . To determine signifi - cant associations between variables , cross - tabbing of the variable was performed and Pearson Chi squared test was applied . Values were considered significant when they were below 0 . 05 ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Results Response rate The authors collected 259 completed questionnaires from the sample size of 304 doctors . In addition to this , six incomplete questionnaires were also received which Khaliq et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2012 , 12 : 76 Page 2 of 8 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1472 - 6947 / 12 / 76 were excluded from the study . This yields a response rate of 85 . 19 % . Respondent characteristics Of the returned questionnaires , 122 ( 47 . 1 % ) were filled by males whereas 137 ( 52 . 9 % ) by females . The mean age of the participants was 29 . 67 ± 7 . 65 years . The study sample population comprised of 138 house officers ( 53 . 3 % ) , 78 residents ( 30 . 1 % ) and 43 fellows ( 16 . 6 % ) . Most respondents belonged to Medicine ( 35 . 1 % ) , and Surgery ( 21 . 6 % ) . Other doctors were from Pediatrics ( 12 . 7 % ) , Anesthesia ( 12 % ) , Psychiatry ( 10 % ) and Obste - trics and Gynecology ( 8 . 5 % ) . Sources of information The source of medical information , which is used most commonly , is medical books . This was affirmed by 185 ( 71 . 4 % ) doctors . 131 ( 50 . 6 % ) doctors answered in posi - tive about reading e - journal to keep themselves updated . ( Please see Figure 1 ) . Less important sources were med - ical software , medical conferences and printed journals which were reported by 83 ( 32 % ) , 78 ( 30 . 1 % ) and 73 ( 28 . 2 % ) doctors , respectively . ( Please see Table 1 for spe - cialty wise breakdown of information sources ) . In terms of literature reading frequency , 137 ( 52 . 9 % ) doctors read less than 5 articles per week . A reading fre - quency of 6 – 10 articles per week was reported by 26 ( 10 % ) doctors . Whereas 9 ( 3 . 5 % ) doctors confirmed reading 11 – 15 articles per week . Only one ( 0 . 4 % ) doctor reported reading more than 15 articles in a week . 86 ( 33 . 2 % ) reported reading zero articles per week . ( Please see Table 1 ) . Regarding components of journals , 178 ( 68 . 7 % ) read articles in the journals . Abstracts of articles are read by 132 ( 51 % ) of the doctors . 59 ( 22 . 8 % ) reported reading re - view articles in the journals . Other sections of the journals including case reports , perspective articles , edi - torial , correspondence , clinical image , special features and classified were read by less than 20 % of the respon - dents . ( Please see Figure 2 ) . Subscription of medical journals , either online or in print , was confirmed by only 30 ( 11 . 6 % ) doctors . Most popular journals amongst our study population were Journal of Pakistan Medical Asso - ciation ( 63 . 2 % ) and Journal of College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan ( 60 . 1 % ) . The age of the participants was found to be signifi - cantly related with articles read per week , paid subscrip - tion to journals and e - journals , medical software and medical conferences as modes of information ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Gender of participating doctors was found to be signifi - cantly related with using books as source of information , articles read per week ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The teaching faculty status of the participating physicians was found to be significantly related to articles read per week and paid subscription to journals ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Electronic journals E - journals were preferred over printed journals by 196 ( 75 . 7 % ) doctors . This question was a multiple response item where subjects were asked to check all items which they found to be relevant with their choice of e - journals over printed journals . The primary reason for such pre - ference was that articles of relevance can be easily searched as reported by 50 . 5 % doctors . Ease of reading articles was cited to be the reason for the choice of e - journals by 29 % participants . Economical use of time ( 29 % ) , remote access to articles away from the library ( 28 . 5 % ) and keeping up with day to day changes in trends in medicine ( 22 . 4 % ) were other reasons for doc - tor ’ s preference of e - journals . In our study population , 110 ( 47 . 6 % ) doctors did not prefer e - journal over their printed counterparts . The Figure 1 Sources of Information used by Pakistani Physicians . Khaliq et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2012 , 12 : 76 Page 3 of 8 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1472 - 6947 / 12 / 76 questionnaire aimed to elicit reasons for this attitude of our study participants . The most common reason men - tioned was subscription charges ( 77 . 7 % ) . Busy schedule was indicated as a participating cause in this attitude by 58 . 7 % clinicians . Lack of interest was quoted as a cause by 31 . 7 % study participants . Connectivity issues to the internet trouble 20 . 6 % of clinicians . ( Please see Table 2 ) . Regarding place where doctors study literature over the internet , 202 ( 78 % ) respondents chose home as the pri - mary place of study . In tertiary care hospital , 54 ( 20 . 8 % ) of doctors browse literature online . Cell phone / smart phone / PDA usage for this purpose was reported by 32 ( 12 . 4 % ) doctors . 9 ( 3 . 5 % ) doctors reported reading literature online at some other place of work . Search engines of Google Scholar ( 87 . 6 % ) , US National Library of Medicine ( Pubmed ) ( 47 . 9 % ) and Pakmedinet ( 23 . 6 % ) were the sources most used by doctors for searching articles on the internet . For searching medical related topics , 157 ( 60 . 6 % ) doctors reported using the internet in the past week . We found significant association between age , gender and teaching status of the participating physicians with preference for e - journals ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Participation in research In our study population , 94 ( 36 . 3 % ) doctors reported publishing no article in a medical journal , at the time of Table 1 Relationship between physician specialties and reading preferences MEDICAL SPECIALTIES Medicine Surgery Gynecology Pediatrics Anesthesia Psychiatry n ( % ) n ( % ) n ( % ) n ( % ) n ( % ) n ( % ) P values Preference of Electronic journals over Printed journals 77 ( 84 . 6 ) 51 ( 91 . 07 ) 21 ( 95 . 45 ) 18 ( 54 . 54 ) 16 ( 51 . 6 ) 13 ( 50 ) < 0 . 001 Paid Subscription of journals 12 ( 13 . 18 ) 11 ( 19 . 64 ) - 2 ( 6 ) 5 ( 16 . 1 ) - 0 . 03 Books 72 ( 79 . 12 ) 34 ( 60 . 71 ) 11 ( 22 ) 17 ( 51 . 5 ) 28 ( 90 . 3 ) 23 ( 88 . 46 ) < 0 . 001 E journals 35 ( 38 . 46 ) 40 ( 71 . 42 ) 7 ( 31 . 8 ) 20 ( 60 . 6 ) 17 ( 54 . 8 ) 12 ( 46 . 15 ) 0 . 001 Medical Software 25 ( 37 . 87 ) 20 ( 35 . 71 ) 9 ( 40 . 9 ) 11 ( 33 . 3 ) 10 ( 32 . 2 ) 8 ( 30 . 76 ) NS Printed Journals 30 ( 32 . 9 ) 15 ( 26 . 78 ) 7 ( 31 . 8 ) 6 ( 18 . 18 ) 8 ( 25 . 8 ) 7 ( 26 . 9 ) NS Medical Conferences 32 ( 35 . 16 ) 18 ( 32 . 14 ) 8 ( 57 . 14 ) 8 ( 24 . 24 ) 5 ( 16 . 1 ) 7 ( 26 . 9 ) NS Articles read per week None 44 ( 48 . 3 ) 3 ( 5 . 3 ) 7 ( 31 . 8 ) 11 ( 33 . 3 ) 14 ( 45 . 1 ) 7 ( 26 . 9 ) < 0 . 001 < 5 38 ( 41 . 7 ) 38 ( 67 . 8 ) 10 ( 45 . 4 ) 22 ( 66 . 6 ) 12 ( 38 . 7 ) 17 ( 65 . 3 ) < 10 7 ( 7 . 6 ) 11 ( 90 . 6 ) 5 ( 22 . 7 ) - 2 ( 6 . 4 ) 1 ( 3 . 8 ) < 15 2 ( 2 ) 4 ( 7 . 1 ) - - 2 ( 6 . 4 ) 1 ( 3 . 8 ) More than 15 - - - - 1 ( 3 . 2 ) - * p < 0 . 05 considered significant . * n ( % ) are from those physicians who gave a positive response to that particular question .

Of the 94 doctors who had not published any article at the time the study was conducted , 43 ( 45 . 7 % ) were house officers , 35 ( 37 . 2 % ) were residents and 16 ( 17 % ) were fel - lows . When subgroup analysis was done in relation with education of the participants , it yielded 31 . 1 % , 44 . 8 % and 37 . 2 % respective percentages for house officers , residents and fellows . This relationship between education level and no published articles was found to be significant . Busy schedule was indicated as the most pressing rea - son for not participating in research activities by 56 . 4 % doctors who hadn ’ t published any research work . Lack of acquaintance with research methodology was reported as a hindrance by 50 % doctors . Lack of interest and lack of incentive were the reasons cited by 37 . 2 % and 41 . 4 clinicians respectively . When the role of doctors as supervisors in articles was assessed , 146 ( 56 . 4 % ) doctors hadn ’ t supervised any article , at the time of interview . 109 ( 42 % ) clinicians had supervised less than 5 articles , whereas 4 ( 1 . 5 % ) had supervised 5 or more articles . We found significant relationship between the age of the participants and articles published by them ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Furthermore , a significant relationship was observed between teaching status of participants and publi - cation and supervision of research articles ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Journal club The presence of journal club in their respective wards was affirmed by 131 ( 50 . 6 % ) doctors . Of the remaining 128 ( 49 . 4 % ) doctors , more than 85 % doctors in each of Table 2 Hierarchical dissection of physician preferences and activities House Officers n ( % ) Residents n ( % ) Fellows n ( % ) Preferred E journals over Printed Journals 116 ( 84 ) 57 ( 73 ) 23 ( 53 . 4 ) Reasons * Easier to read 30 ( 35 . 8 ) 21 ( 36 . 8 ) 6 ( 26 ) Articles of choice 63 ( 54 . 3 ) 29 ( 50 . 8 ) 7 ( 30 . 4 ) Latest trends 24 ( 20 . 6 ) 18 ( 31 . 5 ) 2 ( 8 . 6 ) Less time consuming 32 ( 27 . 5 ) 19 ( 33 . 3 ) 6 ( 26 ) Can Access from any where 34 ( 29 . 3 ) 21 ( 36 . 8 ) 1 ( 0 . 3 ) Didn ’ t prefer e - journals over printed 22 ( 15 . 9 ) 21 ( 26 . 9 ) 20 ( 46 . 5 ) Reasons * * Subscription charges 12 ( 54 . 5 ) 18 ( 85 . 7 ) 19 ( 95 ) No connectivity 3 ( 13 . 6 ) 7 ( 33 . 3 ) 3 ( 15 ) Busy schedule 10 ( 45 . 4 ) 14 ( 66 . 6 ) 13 ( 65 ) Not interested 6 ( 27 . 2 ) 6 ( 28 . 5 ) 8 ( 40 ) Articles Published None 43 ( 31 . 1 ) 35 ( 44 . 8 ) 16 ( 37 . 2 ) Less than 5 89 ( 64 . 4 ) 43 ( 55 . 1 ) 19 ( 44 . 1 ) 5 - 10 6 ( 4 . 3 ) - 4 ( 9 . 3 ) More than 10 - - 4 ( 9 . 3 ) Articles Supervised None 79 ( 57 . 2 ) 43 ( 55 . 1 ) 24 ( 43 ) Less than 5 59 ( 42 . 7 ) 35 ( 44 . 8 ) 15 ( 34 . 8 ) 5 or greater - - 4 ( 9 . 3 ) No articles Published * * * Reasons Busy Schedule 18 ( 41 . 8 ) 24 ( 68 . 5 ) 11 ( 68 . 7 ) Not acquainted with research methodology 26 ( 60 . 4 ) 15 ( 42 . 8 ) 6 ( 37 . 5 ) Lack of Interest 12 ( 27 . 9 ) 16 ( 45 . 7 ) 7 ( 43 . 7 ) Lack of incentive 12 ( 27 . 9 ) 17 ( 48 . 5 ) 10 ( 62 . 5 ) * Percentage calculated from those who preferred e - journals over printed . * * Percentage calculated from those who did not prefer e journals over printed . * * * Percentage calculated from those who haven ' t published any research article .

Discussion Our study highlights that text books are the primary source of information of doctors . This preference is in - dependent of the level of education and the hierarchical placement of doctor in the hospital system . Studies con - ducted in the USA show a similar trend of devotion to - wards books [ 10 - 13 ] . E - journals were rated as the second most preferred source for information by our clinicians . More than 50 % of residents responded posi - tively about reading e - journals . This indicates a positive attitude of our clinicians towards incorporating more re - cent advances in medicine in their training . Most of our study respondents ( 68 . 7 % ) reported reading full text arti - cles from the journals . This particular choice of reading material is imperative for development of proper under - standing regarding issues of clinical importance [ 14 ] . Comparison of printed versus electronic journal revealed a preference for the latter from more than 75 % of the physicians interviewed . Similar findings have been reported in studies conducted elsewhere [ 15 - 17 ] . The ease of locating relevant articles from the electronic databases was suggested as the most common reason for choosing the electronic form over paper . This indicates that despite busy schedules , doctors take measures to keep abreast with the on - going medical developments . Most of the doctors interviewed reported accessing articles from their homes . This reflects the lack of quick reference practice using smart phones and personal digital assistants ( PDA ) ’ s by our doctors . This is in contrast to the practices of med - ical students and residents in USA who use their PDA ’ s and software for practicing evidence based medicine [ 18 , 19 ] . The use of telecommunication facilities for acquir - ing knowledge for evidence based medicine does not ap - pear to parallel the growth of this sector in Pakistan . Nearly 25 % of our study population refrained from using electronic journals . High subscription charges of journals was the reason held responsible by most ( 77 . 7 % ) of the doctors who were reluctant to browse electronic journals . Unavailability of time was regarded an impediment for usage of electronic literature by 58 % of the respondents . 56 . 4 % of our study participants suggested that hectic schedule as the hindrance for non - participation in research related activities . This was fol - lowed by lack of acquaintance with research method - ology for no publications ( 50 % ) . In our setup , research training is still at grass roots level with very few mentors for a large student popula - tion . Aslam , F . reports that majority of articles ( almost 95 % ) in the student corner of the Journal of Pakistan Medical Association are contributed by students of pri - vate medical colleges [ 20 ] . This is food for thought for the policy makers at public medical schools as inculcat - ing research training at medical school level is essential for training more research oriented doctors for tomor - row [ 21 ] . One can see the benefits of the recent initiative of introducing research training in medical curriculum in our study where 68 . 8 % of house officers have reported to publish some research article . Journal critique club is a well established method of acquainting physicians with latest development [ 22 - 25 ] . This not only serves the purpose of enhancing their clin - ical knowledge , but also raises their interest about re - search activities . This critique also nurtures the ability of critical appraisal of different scenarios and helps to de - velop better insight in the clinicians . Almost half the doctors interviewed pointed out that there were no jour - nal club meeting in their workplace . However , about 88 . 3 % of these doctors are keen in participating in such an activity , if it were to be commenced in their ward . When our results were compared with other studies with similar interest conducted in developing countries , several disparities were noted . Doctors from Kenya and Egypt reported high interest in reading articles from North American journals which impact their clinical practice [ 26 ] . In contrast to this finding , our participants were more inclined towards local journals . Due to high subscription charges of journals , most doctors cannot af - ford to read them if there is no institutional support , as in our case . In a study from Nigeria , Ajuwon G states that Nigerian physicians are proficient in using Internet for patient healthcare ( more than 90 % replied in affirmative about different domains in their questionnaire ) , with rates being even higher than those in Switzerland and USA in some cases [ 1 ] . When our results were compared with these , they were found to be a lot less than of doctors in Nigeria . The lack of internet connection at primary place of work is the problem mentioned by both Pakistani and Nigerian doctors . However , the Nigerian doctors access the internet through cyber cafés whereas our doctors used residential internet connections . The difference that exists between the two populations needs to be bridged . A proposed solution is journal club initiative in all units and mandatory attendance in such sessions . This would serve to increase the exposure of doctors to internet for searching healthcare related literature . We see a tepid response our physicians towards re - search activities . There are several reasons for such luke - warm response . Foremost amongst them is the total Khaliq et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2012 , 12 : 76 Page 6 of 8 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1472 - 6947 / 12 / 76 absence of a formal training in their medical school only until recently . Previous studies conducted in Pakistan and India have already highlighted the importance of ab - sence of formal training in research methodology and biostatistics [ 27 , 28 ] . This no doubts impacts the future response of doctors towards research activities . Other noteworthy factors for this behavior are too few experi - enced supervisors , no or ineffective journal club activ - ities and lack of institutional support for subscription to paid journals which promote interest in research . Where these factors are mentioned , it is essential to mention , that most studies conducted recently in our setup have been cross sectional studies which contribute less to - wards solving the problem at hand , as compared to clin - ical trials [ 2 , 29 ] . Lack of funding plays a key role in preference for cross - sectional studies . Limitation The convenience sampling employed in this study and the limitation of this study within a single centre ; limit its generalization to the entire doctor population of Pakistan . The study sample was limited to practicing clinicians from the hospital . It excluded private practitioners as well as doctors related to basic sciences without clinical practice . It is likely that trends differ in these groups . Self reporting and a low response rate ( as compared to similar studies ) are also the limitations of this study . Conclusion The medical literature reading and writing practices of our physicians plead for an urgent intervention from concerned authorities . This can range from support pro - vided through institutional subscription of various jour - nals to establishment of digital libraries with high speed internet connection and online subscription to journals . There is also a need for provision of medical software and gadgets which enable our doctors to remain in touch with updated healthcare literature while on the move . To promote research culture in future doctors , we propose that research training at the medical school level be reinforced with mentor system . This should take into account individual student interest to make it more effective . Changes in syllabus are necessary to help stu - dents develop a definitive and concrete understanding of biomedical research terminology and how to interpret researches . This understanding of biomedical research should also be furthered at the resident level with jour - nal club meetings and small focus groups held within wards . Attendance in such sessions should be made compulsory to ensure that proper understanding is acquired by all participants . Evidence based medicine keeps in consideration the regional difference in etiologies of diseases . Hence the need for local data from our population to guide therapy effectively cannot be emphasized enough . This requires periodic reminders to doctors and medical students to take part in research activities . Appreciation of research work should be made a part of institutional mindset . This will go a long way in ensuring that doctors are motivated to produce more original research work with special focus towards regional problems .
