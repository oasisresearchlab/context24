This study aimed to assess the severity and types of COVID - 19 cases and associated symptoms among school students in Iraq . A comprehensive study was conducted by the Public Health Directorate of AL - Muthanna Governorate from November 29 , 2020 , to February 12 , 2021 , utilizing RT - PCR - based COVID - 19 surveys . The survey included 9 , 357 students ( 4 , 261 male and 5 , 096 female ) and 83 schools . The retrospective analysis of the survey records indicated that male and female students had a mean age of 9 . 2±1 . 16 years with notably higher rates of asymptomatic infections than older students . Male students showed lower odds of asymptomatic infection but higher odds of symptomatic and pre - symptomatic infections compared to their female peers , particularly among elementary students . Fever , ab - dominal pain , diarrhea , loss of taste and smell , shortness of breath , and muscle pain were significantly associated with COVID - 19 infection . Sneezing was significantly associated with a lack of infection . Home nursing by parents and self - care practices have proven to be highly effective in controlling COVID - 19 infection among children . These findings highlight the need for age - and gender - specific considerations in COVID - 19 prevention and management strategies in schools .

The COVID - 19 pandemic has brought unprec - edented challenges to the global community , affecting millions of lives and livelihoods . The impact of COVID - 19 has been profound , with a devastating loss of life and prolonged health consequences [ 2 ] . The global infection fatality rates ( IFRs ) of COVID - 19 exhib - it significant heterogeneity . While some countries were struggling with waves of severe cases , others were reporting relatively low IFRs [ 3 - 5 ] . The symptoms and severity of COVID - 19 infection can vary widely from person to person , with substantial variations across continents and countries . Factors such as age , underlying health conditions , immune response , access to healthcare , socio - economic status , variant strains of the virus , and adherence to public health measures can impact the outcome of COVID - 19 infection . While some individuals may experience mild symptoms such as fever , cough , and fatigue , others may develop severe respi - ratory distress and organ failure requiring intensive medical care . Additionally , some individuals may remain asymptomatic , show - ing no signs of illness . It is crucial to recognize and monitor these variations to better understand and manage the impacts of the pandemic and to protect vulnerable populations [ 6 - 10 ] . Asymp - tomatic infection is defined as an individual who tested positive for a laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection but did not exhib - it any clinical symptoms associated with COVID - 19 throughout the course of their illness . In contrast , pre - symptomatic infection is characterized by an individual who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 but showed no symptoms at the time of diagnosis or during the early phase of infection but later developed COVID - 19 - related clinical symptoms during follow - up [ 7 ] . The first confirmed case of COVID - 19 in Iraq was detected in February 2020 , at a time when the government and health sector were hardly able to face such a health crisis [ 11 ] . Until April 19 , 2023 , Iraq witnessed four waves of COVID - 19 , with more than 2 . 4 million confirmed cases , resulting in over 25 , 000 deaths . About 9 million people have been vaccinated , representing approximately 25 % of the Iraqi popula - tion [ 12 ] . The Iraqi government implemented several precaution - ary measures , including suspending in - person education in univer - sities and schools , with some restrictions on movement since early JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE 1553 JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE . VOL : 16 ISSUE : 10 OCTOBER 2023 Licensed under CC BY 4 . 0 2020 at the onset of the first wave [ 12 - 14 ] . The education sector in Iraq has been plagued by various crises , including inadequate in - frastructure , armed conflicts , protests , and internal migration . The COVID - 19 pandemic has further exacerbated these pre - existing challenges . Consequently , the pandemic has disproportionally im - pacted thousands of students deprived of equitable educational opportunities due to school closure [ 15 ] . Insufficient research ex - ists on the nature and severity of COVID - 19 , specifically among students in Iraq , creating a significant knowledge gap . This study aimed to fill the gap by analyzing the COVID - 19 survey data from the Al - Muthanna Education Directorate to understand its impact on Iraqi school students and assess parental care of infected chil - dren during home quarantine . MATERIAL AND METHODS Between November 29 , 2020 , and February 12 , 2021 , a col - laborative effort was undertaken by the Department of School Environment and Health / Education Directorate in collabora - tion with the Public Health Directorate in Al - Muthanna Prov - ince to conduct a cross - sectional survey aimed at assessing the prevalence of COVID - 19 infections among students in Al - Muth - anna Province . Al - Muthanna Province , located in southwestern Iraq , covers an area of 51 , 740 km 2 , representing 11 . 9 % of Iraq ' s total land area , and is inhabited by approximately one million residents , accounting for 3 % of Iraq ' s overall population [ 16 ] . The province encompasses 648 schools , including 542 elementa - ry schools , 43 intermediate schools , and 63 preparatory schools , with an overall enrollment of 253 , 916 students . The selection of schools was carried out using two methods : the first method involved identifying schools with suspected cases of COVID - 19 infections based on semi - daily reports from school administrators responsible for monitoring suspected cases among students . The second method entailed random selection , with schools being stratified based on type ( elementary , intermediate , and preparatory schools ) . Subsequently , 83 schools were ran - domly selected from this stratification , with at least 50 students tested in each selected school . Nine health teams , consisting of four to five well - trained health technicians , collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyn - geal swabs following the COVID - 19 specimen collection and processing guidelines provided by the Iraqi Ministry of Health [ 17 ] . A real - time reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) assay was performed at Al - Muthanna Public Health Laboratory using the RealLine Pathogen Diagnostic Kit BI1019 - 96 and CFX96 Real - Time System BIO - RAD ( USA ) . Approx - imately 50 - 150 COVID - 19 tests were performed almost every day . To detect asymptomatic COVID - 19 infections , swabs were randomly collected from 8 , 876 / 9 , 357 students who did not ex - hibit symptoms . For pre - symptomatic infections , students with positive COVID - 19 infection were monitored for symptom on - set . Students who exhibited any symptoms related to COVID - 19 infection , such as fever , cough , shortness of breath or difficulty breathing , diarrhea , headache , and sore throat , were consid - ered pre - symptomatically infected . For symptomatic infections , samples were collected from 481 / 9 , 357 students showing symp - toms of illness . Students with positive COVID - 19 results were home - quarantined . The RT - PCR test results typically took two or three days due to equipment and specialist shortages . Precau - tions were taken before and after receiving the results , includ - ing granting leave to students with symptoms until their test results returned . If the results were negative , they were permit - ted to return to school . Pupils with positive results were sent to home quarantine with all their classroom peers who had been in contact with them . The school was closed entirely if multi - ple COVID - 19 cases were recorded in different classrooms . Raw data from the COVID - 19 survey were obtained from the School Environment and Health Department records , including stu - dent information such as name , gender , age , presence of illness symptoms , specimen date , and home contact details . Based on this student contact information , cases of COVID - 19 infection were monitored by the school administration . Parents of infected children were requested to promptly inform the school adminis - tration regarding their child ' s health condition , symptoms , and any new COVID - 19 infections within the family . Statistical analysis Raw data was collected , tabulated , and coded on a Micro - soft Excel Worksheet . The statistical analysis was performed using Jamovi 2 version 2 . 3 . 28 and MedCalc Version 22 . 009 . The odds ratio of asymptomatic , pre - symptomatic , and symp - tomatic COVID - 19 infections in male students was calculated using female students as the reference category . A chi - square test of proportion difference was used to detect differences in the proportion of symptoms between male and female students . A chi - square test was also conducted to identify any association be - tween symptoms and confirmed COVID - 19 infection . A p - value ≤0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . RESULTS A total of 83 schools ( 50 elementary schools , 13 intermediate schools , and 20 preparatory schools ) were visited from November 29 , 2020 , until the start of distance education on February 12 , 2021 . During this period , specialized health teams collected swabs from 9 , 357 students ( 4 , 261 males and 5 , 096 females ) with a mean age of 12 . 67±3 . 63 years , representing 3 . 7 % of the total students ( Table 1 ) . The test results confirmed the SARS - CoV - 2 infection of 420 ( 4 . 5 % ) students , including 179 / 4 , 261 ( 4 . 2 % ) male students and 241 / 5 , 096 ( 4 . 73 % ) female students , with no significant difference in overall COVID - 19 infection rates be - tween male and female students . Among elementary students ( ele - students ) , a total of 157 COVID - 19 infections were record - ed , with 78 males and 79 females affected . Within this group , 123 cases were asymptomatic ( 54 males and 69 females ) , 19 were pre - symptomatic ( 14 males and 5 females ) , and 15 were symp - tomatic ( 10 males and 5 females ) . The odds of asymptomatic in - fection were significantly lower in male ele - students compared to their female peers . Conversely , the odds of symptomatic infection were significantly higher in male ele - students compared to their female peers . Among intermediate students ( int - students ) , 124 infections were reported , with 43 cases among males and 81 among females . This included 34 asymptomatic cases ( 14 males and 20 females ) , 50 pre - symptomatic cases ( 13 males and 37 fe - males ) , and 40 symptomatic cases ( 16 males and 24 females ) . Fur - thermore , 139 infections were recorded among preparatory stu - dents ( prep - students ) , which comprised 48 asymptomatic cases ( 19 males and 29 females ) , 68 pre - symptomatic cases ( 32 males and 36 females ) , and 23 symptomatic cases ( 7 males and 16 fe - males ) . There were no significant differences in the odds of infec - tion detected between elementary and preparatory male and fe - JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE 1554 JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE .

No signif - icant difference was observed in the odds of symptomatic infec - tions between prep - and int - students . Furthermore , there were no significant differences found in the odds of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID - 19 infections between male int - students and prep - students . Notably , the odds of asymptomatic infections in female int - students were significantly lower compared to their female peers in elementary schools ( OR = 0 . 04 , 95 % CI : 0 . 01 – 0 . 11 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . In contrast , the odds of symptomatic infections were significantly higher in female int - students ( OR = 5 . 73 , 95 % CI : 2 . 13 – 15 . 42 ; p < 0 . 001 ) compared to their female peers in ele - mentary schools . Similarly , the odds of asymptomatic infections were significantly lower in female prep - students ( OR = 0 . 06 , 95 % CI : 0 . 02 – 0 . 16 ; p < 0 . 001 ) compared to their female peers in ele - male students ( Table 2 ) . The proportion of asymptomatic infections was 60 % , with no significant difference between fe - male and male students . Conversely , the overall proportion of infected students with symptoms was 16 . 2 % . The odds ratio of COVID - 19 infection among male students with symptoms was 2 . 4 times higher than that among their female counterparts with symptoms . Based on the data presented in Table 2 , it can also be concluded that male int - students exhibited significantly lower odds of asymptomatic infections compared to their male elemen - tary school peers ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 0 . 28 , 95 % confidence inter - val [ CI ] : 0 . 1 - 0 . 73 ; p = 0 . 009 ) . No significant difference in the odds of symptomatic infections was observed between male ele - and int - students . Similarly , the odds of asymptomatic infections in prep - students were significantly lower when compared to male Table 1 .

As documented in the medical records of the School Health Envi - ronment Department , effective home nursing encompassed ac - tivities such as symptom monitoring , administering prescribed medications , maintaining proper hygiene practices , and ensuring adequate rest and nutrition . Intermediate and preparatory school students , particularly male students , exhibited a commendable level of self - care , demonstrating effective cooperation and under - standing of home quarantine procedures . These procedures en - compassed hygiene practices , respiratory hygiene / cough eti - quette , adherence to medical advice , maintenance of physical distancing , mask - wearing , and isolation . However , it is worth noting that the home quarantine procedures presented consider - able challenges for female students across all age categories . Par - ents reported instances of heightened fear and anxiety among female students during the quarantine period . Importantly , there were no reported fatalities among students due to COVID - 19 and no cases of severe infection , except for three students who had severe asthma . DISCUSSION Iraq has experienced four waves of the COVID - 19 pandem - ic , with the first wave occurring in September 2020 , two subse - quent waves in April and July 2021 , and a fourth wave in Janu - ary 2022 [ 12 ] . This study revealed the types , severity , and manifestations of COVID - 19 infections among school students while also investigating the influence of gender and age on these variables . The current findings found that among 9 , 357 students , 420 ( 4 . 5 % ) tested positive for COVID - 19 , aligning with other studies indicating similar infection rates in school - age children [ 18 , 19 ] . Analysis of daily statistics from Iraq ' s Ministry of Health websites revealed notable variations in cu - mulative infection rates across different age groups . For the years 2020 , 2021 , and 2022 , the infection rates were 1 . 5 % , 7 . 8 % , 22 . 7 % , and 24 % for age groups 0 - 9 , 10 - 19 , 20 - 29 , and 30 - 39 , respectively , which clearly indicates an increase in the cumulative infection rate with age [ 20 , 21 ] . Age significantly impacts infection , hospitalization , and mortality rates , with in - dividuals aged 0 - 4 and 5 - 17 exhibiting lower rates compared to those in the 18 - 29 age group [ 22 ] . The present findings suggest a comparable COVID - 19 infection risk among male and fe - male students aged 12 . 67±3 . 63 years , aligning with prior stud - ies indicating no significant gender - based differences in infec - tion rates [ 23 - 25 ] . Nevertheless , other studies documented gender distinctions in school student infection risk , where fe - male students exhibited higher COVID - 19 rates compared to their male counterparts [ 26 , 27 ] . Asymptomatic COVID - 19 infections are cases where a person is infected with SARS - CoV - 2 but exhibits no symptoms [ 6 ] . According to the current results , the ratio of asymptomatic COVID - 19 infections among students aged 12 . 67±3 . 63 years was 60 % , with no statistically significant difference observed between female and male stu - dents . Studies across various countries explored asymptomatic COVID - 19 in 2 , 072 school - aged children , revealing rates ex - ceeding 70 % [ 24 , 28 - 31 ] . Another systematic review of 18 studies found asymptomatic COVID - 19 rates in children from 6 . 3 % to 93 . 6 % , with an overall estimate of 20 . 1 % [ 19 ] . Among 1 , 152 children in 11 studies , the pooled asymptomatic rate was 27 . 7 % , surpassing other age groups [ 32 ] . Even with comorbid - ities , COVID - 19 - infected children generally show milder symp - mentary schools . However , the odds of symptomatic infections in female prep - students were significantly higher ( OR = 7 . 28 , 95 % CI : 2 . 57 – 20 . 61 ; p < 0 . 001 ) compared to their female peers in ele - mentary schools . No significant differences were observed in the odds of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID - 19 infections between female int - students and prep - students . The study un - veiled a significant association between COVID - 19 infection among school students and the presence of fever , abdominal pain , diarrhea , loss of taste and smell , shortness of breath , and muscle pain . In contrast , sneezing indicated a lower likelihood of infection . There was no apparent association between the pres - ence of cough , headache , or sore throat and COVID - 19 infec - tion . Female students manifested significantly higher occurrences of cough , abdominal pain , and loss of taste and smell than their male peers , with no significant differences in other symptoms . Shortness of breath emerged as the least prevalent symptom in both male and female students , and there were no significant dif - ferences between them , as illustrated in Table 3 . Figure 1 clearly illustrates that COVID - 19 symptoms manifested in varying pro - portions , underscoring the differential impact on male and fe - male students . Moreover , the prevalence of each symptom may exhibit significant variation depending on the patient ' s age and gender . As shown in Table 4 , among the 68 infected male ele - stu - dents , only 14 ( 20 . 6 % ) developed symptoms of COVID - 19 infec - tion . Of the 34 male ele - students with symptoms , 10 / 34 ( 29 . 4 % ) tested positive for COVID - 19 infection . A chi - square test showed a significant association between infection and the presence of fever , sore throat , diarrhea , and nasal congestion . Of 74 infected female ele - students , 5 / 74 ( 6 . 8 ) developed symptoms of infection . Of 171 female ele - students with symptoms , 5 / 171 ( 2 . 9 % ) were diagnosed with infection . A significant association was detected between fever , sore throat , abdominal pain , diarrhea , and short - ness of breath with positive infection . Sneezing was associated with the absence of infection . As for male int - students , among the 27 infected students , 13 / 27 ( 48 . 1 % ) exhibited pre - symptom - atic infections . Moreover , among the 72 students with symptoms , 16 / 72 ( 22 . 2 % ) tested positive for the infection . Infection was sig - nificantly associated with diarrhea , nasal congestion , loss of taste and smell , some shortness of breath , and muscle / joint pain . Out of 1522 female int - students , 57 ( 3 . 75 % ) were diagnosed with COVID - 19 infection , and only 37 / 57 ( 64 . 9 % ) developed symp - toms of the infection , indicating pre - symptomatic infections among the majority of cases . Among the 94 female int - students with symptoms , 24 ( 25 . 5 % ) tested positive for infection . Infection was significantly associated with abdominal pain , diarrhea , nasal congestion , loss of taste and smell , some shortness of breath , and muscle / joint pain . Of 51 infected male prep - students , 32 / 51 ( 62 . 7 % ) students developed symptoms ( pre - symptomatic ) . Among the 21 male prep - students with symptoms , seven students tested positive for COVID - 19 . Regarding female prep - students , out of the 65 infected students , 36 / 65 ( 55 . 4 % ) developed symp - toms ( pre - symptomatic ) . Among the 89 female prep - students with symptoms , 16 ( 18 % ) students tested positive for COVID - 19 . Infection was significantly associated with fever , loss of taste and smell , and some shortness of breath . Sneezing and diarrhea in female students were significantly associated with the absence of COVID - 19 infections . Conversely , no significant association was observed between COVID - 19 infection and symptoms such as cough , headache , sore throat , abdominal pain , and nasal conges - tion .

VOL : 16 ISSUE : 10 OCTOBER 2023 Licensed under CC BY 4 . 0 tially have a modest impact on slowing down the spread of COVID - 19 . Therefore , it is recommended to complement mo - bility - limiting measures with other public health interventions , such as ubiquitous mask usage [ 13 ] . Considering the outcomes gleaned from this study , extending home - based healthcare to children , involving interventions like administering antipyretics , ensuring optimal ventilation , maintaining proper hydration , and employing pain - relief medications , emerges as a viable strategy for tackling COVID - 19 . In Iraq , schools have been closed repeatedly during the last two years due to the COVID - 19 pandemic forcing a shift to online learning . The choice to tem - porarily close schools in Iraq for extended periods might indeed be a sound decision . Research conducted by Chernozhukov et al . suggests that regions that opted for in - person K - 12 schooling experienced , on average , a 5 - percentage point increase in the rate of COVID - 19 case growth [ 48 ] . Improving e - learning should not only focus on technical improvements , such as en - hancing the quality of the internet and the devices used . In - stead , it should also encompass rehabilitation programs for chil - dren to enhance their cyberculture . This approach can assist children in avoiding harmful websites , addressing the concerns of mothers who worry about the lack of control over the quali - ty of information their children access through e - learning [ 39 ] . In addition to implementing home nursing procedures , it is es - sential to provide children with emotional support , as they might grapple with feelings of fear or anxiety while undergoing isolation and quarantine [ 49 ] . The present study stands as the sole of its kind in Iraq , but it did not explore the cons and pros of school closures or dive into how community infection rates interact with student infections or vice versa . These findings emphasize the necessity for immediate evidence - based inter - ventions to contain COVID - 19 transmission among students . Multiple visits to the same school were not feasible due to lim - itations in human resources and technical capabilities . Tracking new COVID - 19 cases for educator - to - educator , educa - tor - to - student , student - to - student transmission was challenging . Self - reported symptoms might carry recall and social biases . Symptoms were assessed by parents and school staff rather than healthcare professionals . However , this approach introduces a potential for inaccuracies in gauging both the nature and sever - ity of symptoms . No blood tests were adopted to assess different aspects of the COVID - 19 infection ( e . g . , complete blood count ( CBC ) , C - reactive protein ( CRP ) , D - dimer , Ferritin , and Inter - leukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) ) . Many sociodemographic factors , such as eth - nicity / race , socioeconomic status , geographic location , comor - bidities , and living conditions , were not included in the study nor analyzed . CONCLUSION Asymptomatic COVID - 19 infections were more prevalent than symptomatic infections among school students with a mean age of 12 . 67±3 . 63 years . Male students exhibited a higher likeli - hood of testing positive for COVID - 19 compared to female peers upon symptom onset , with students aged 9 . 2±1 . 16 years showing higher rates of asymptomatic infections than their older coun - terparts . Fever , abdominal pain , diarrhea , loss of taste and smell , shortness of breath , and muscle pain were strongly linked to COVID - 19 infection . Sneezing was associated with the absence of COVID - 19 infection . There may be gender - and age - related differences in the manifestation of symptoms . toms . Notably , OAS1 / 2 / 3 gene cluster variations were linked to genetic predisposition for COVID - 19 pneumonia in children [ 33 ] . Co - infections such as influenza and mycoplasma are among the common health problems in children during COVID - 19 infection , which may exacerbate the severity of symptoms [ 34 ] . Age appears pivotal in asymptomatic infection rates , with older adults , particularly males , showing more severe symptoms than young adults [ 35 ] . In addition to age and body weight , COVID - 19 risk encompasses employment status and place of residence [ 36 ] . A pooled analysis of 95 studies with a sample size of over 29 million individuals revealed that 40 . 5 % of those who tested positive for COVID - 19 were asymptomatic [ 37 ] , which poses a significant risk factor for increased commu - nity transmission . The present findings suggest that fever , ab - dominal pain , diarrhea , loss of taste and smell , shortness of breath , and muscle pain emerged as notable indicators of COVID - 19 infection . In 2020 , a study in Sulaimaniyah City , Iraq , identified fever as the predominant symptom among chil - dren with COVID - 19 [ 38 ] . In line with Pérez - Gaxiola et al . , the present study revealed that apart from diarrhea and nasal con - gestion , fever , cough , and headache stood out as some of the most prevalent symptoms among infected males and females [ 39 ] . Age can significantly influence the severity and the specif - ic manifestations of COVID - 19 symptoms [ 40 ] . It is evident that relying on COVID - 19 symptoms observed in adults is not reliable for diagnosing infection in children [ 41 , 42 ] . The cur - rent findings indicate that diarrhea and abdominal pain , unusu - al for respiratory infections , are strongly linked to COVID - 19 infection in children . This aligns with Zimmermann and Cur - tis , who noted similarities between COVID - 19 and gastrointes - tinal infections in children [ 43 ] . The current findings highlight the need for increased awareness and consideration of atypical symptoms when screening and testing for COVID - 19 in chil - dren . Recognizing the association between diarrhea , abdomi - nal pain , and COVID - 19 infection may lead to earlier identifi - cation and isolation of infected children , which could reduce transmission and improve outcomes . On the other hand , the study found that the presence of sneezing was associated with a lower likelihood of COVID - 19 infection , which may be surpris - ing given that it is a common symptom of respiratory infec - tions . The current study did not detect any noticeable associa - tion between COVID - 19 infection and the existence of cough , headache , or sore throat . Other clinical criteria can be adopted to track the course of COVID - 19 infections in hospitalized chil - dren , as Henry et al . recommended . Pediatricians should serially monitor c - reactive protein ( CRP ) , procalcitonin ( PCT ) , and lac - tate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) . The authors also concluded that elevated creatine kinase - MB ( CK - MB ) in mild pediatric COVID - 19 cases is indicative of possible cardiac injury [ 44 ] . Lymphopenia is less common , and elevated creatine kinase - MB ( CK - MB ) is more common in children with COVID - 19 com - pared to adults , suggesting that heart injury would be more like - ly to occur in pediatric patients [ 45 ] . The refusal to accept the COVID - 19 vaccine has significantly contributed to the ongoing challenges in COVID - 19 management . A study at Al - Zahraa University in Iraq found that 70 . 4 % of students rejected the COVID - 19 vaccine , with concerns about safety and a lack of awareness about the different types of vaccines [ 46 ] . Further - more , the COVID - 19 pandemic caused a reduction in the vac - cination coverage rate ( VCR ) among children in Iraq , indicat - ing the need for new health policies that can help increase VCR [ 47 ] .
