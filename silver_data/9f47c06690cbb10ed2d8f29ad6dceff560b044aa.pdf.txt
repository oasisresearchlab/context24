Prion - speciﬁc Hsp40 function : The role of the auxilin homolog Swa2 Emily E . Oliver , Elizabeth M . Troisi y , and Justin K . Hines Department of Chemistry , Lafayette College , Easton , PA , USA ABSTRACT . Yeast prions are protein - based genetic elements that propagate through cell populations via cytosolic transfer from mother to daughter cell . Molecular chaperone proteins including Hsp70 , the Hsp40 / J - protein Sis1 , and Hsp104 are required for continued prion propagation , however the speciﬁc requirements of chaperone proteins differ for various prions . We recently reported that Swa2 , the yeast homolog of the mammalian protein auxilin , is speciﬁcally required for the propagation of the prion [ URE3 ] . 1 [ URE3 ] propagation requires both a functional J - domain and the tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR ) domain of Swa2 , but does not require Swa2 clathrin binding . We concluded that the TPR domain determines the speciﬁcity of the genetic interaction between Swa2 and [ URE3 ] , and that this domain likely interacts with one or more proteins with a C - terminal EEVD motif . Here we extend that analysis to incorporate additional data that supports this hypothesis . We also present new data eliminating Hsp104 as the relevant Swa2 binding partner and discuss our ﬁndings in the context of other recent work involving Hsp90 . Based on these ﬁndings , we propose a new model for Swa2’s involvement in [ URE3 ] propagation in which Swa2 and Hsp90 mediate the formation of a multi - protein complex that increases the number of sites available for Hsp104 disaggregation .

Sis1 and Ssa are known to bind directly to prion aggregates , allowing the productive recruitment of Hsp104 . 13 - 19 Numerous other chaperone and co - chaperone proteins have also been impli - cated in prion propagation . Most relevant here are additional members of the Hsp40 co - chap - erone family and the chaperone Hsp90 , for which its own indirect involvement , and direct involvement of its co - chaperones , has been described in [ PSI C ] propagation , formation , and curing . 20 - 24 Hsp40s , hereafter called J - proteins , stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 , stabilizing its interaction with client proteins . 25 Sis1 is an important cytosolic J - protein that is speciﬁcally required for the continued propagation of all 4 amyloid - based prions ( [ PSI C ] , [ RNQ C ] , [ URE3 ] , and [ SWI C ] ) for which data are avail - able . 15 - 17 However , the speciﬁc portions of Sis1 required for the propagation of these prions dif - fer , indicating that the exact roles and require - ments of chaperone proteins are not universal in yeast prion propagation . 6 , 26 - 30 In further support of this idea , one of us ( JKH ) previously deter - mined that an additional J - protein , Ydj1 , is required for the propagation of [ SWI C ] speciﬁ - cally , 17 and we recently reported the ﬁnding that [ URE3 ] speciﬁcally requires the action of a third J - protein , Swa2 . 1 Swa2 is the homolog of the mammalian protein auxilin , which is respon - sible for uncoating clathrin - coated vesicles during clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 31 , 32 Anal - ogous to auxilin , Swa2 recruits Hsp70 to clathrin and stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp70 through its J - domain , disassembling the clathrin lattice following vesicle formation . 31 , 33 Others have also recently reported additional co - chaperone requirements for the propagation of [ URE3 ] . 20 Here we will review our most recent ﬁndings regarding Swa2 and prion propa - gation , 1 present additional data , and discuss these new results in the context of a recently published complementary investigation from another laboratory . 20 Collectively , these investi - gations suggest that Hsp90 may be the critical binding partner of Swa2 in [ URE3 ] propagation , and we propose a new model for plausible Swa2 - Hsp90 cooperation in [ URE3 ] prion propagation . [ URE3 ] Exhibits a “Secondary” J - Protein Requirement for Swa2 While the requirement for Sis1 for the propa - gation of [ URE3 ] was previously established , the dispensability or requirement of the other 12 remaining cytosolic J - proteins for this prion was unclear . 16 To determine if any additional cyto - solic J - proteins were required for [ URE3 ] propa - gation , as is the case for at least one other prion ( [ SWI C ] ) , 17 [ ure - o ] strains carrying individual deletions of each of the cytosolic J - proteins were crossed with a strain bearing [ URE3 – 1 ] , the strong variant of [ URE3 ] originally isolated by LaCroute and the most widely studied vari - ant of the prion in the literature ( commonly and hereafter just called [ URE3 ] ) . 16 , 34 - 36 We isolated F1 haploids maintaining [ URE3 ] but lacking a single J - protein gene in 11 of the 12 crosses , demonstrating that 11 of the 13 cytosolic J - pro - teins of S . cerevisiae are dispensable for [ URE3 ] propagation . 1 However despite numer - ous attempts , [ URE3 ] was lost in all swa2 - D haploids , indicating that Swa2 might be required , in addition to Sis1 , for [ URE3 ] propa - gation . To begin to conﬁrm this , we ﬁrst veriﬁed that the biochemically complex color phenotype of [ URE3 ] was not affected by the loss of Swa2 by performing a backcross between these F1 haploids and a cured version of the [ URE3 ] parental strain . All diploids and SWA2 haploids isolated from this backcross remained J - PROTEIN FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICITY IN PRION BIOLOGY 175 phenotypically [ ure - o ] ( red colony color ) , con - ﬁrming that [ URE3 ] was indeed lost in the origi - nal cross . 1 To eliminate the possibility that [ URE3 ] simply became unstable during meiosis when these parental strains were crossed , we mated a [ URE3 ] strain and a strain bearing a genomic deletion of SWA2 covered by a plasmid expressing Swa2 . Following loss of the Swa2 - expressing plasmid , cells again lost the [ URE3 ] color phenotype , and exhibited the slow - growth phenotype characteristic of swa2 - D cells . 37 , 38 Subsequent transformation by a plasmid expressing Ure2 - GFP , followed by ﬂuorescence microscopy revealed complete loss of Ure2 protein aggregation , which again conﬁrmed that the color phenotype accurately reported the prion status . Together these data demonstrated the rapid and total loss of [ URE3 ] coincident with loss of Swa2 expression . 1 Because [ URE3 ] is sensitive to altered levels of chaperone protein expression including Ydj1 , Sis1 , Ssa1 – 4 , Sse1 and Hsp104 and others , 16 , 39 , 40 it was important to determine if loss of [ URE3 ] was potentially due to an induced stress response resulting from this deletion , rather than directly from the loss of Swa2 . We found no signiﬁcant differences in protein expression of other molecular chaper - ones in the absence of Swa2 that could explain prion loss , and no indication that Swa2 deletion induces a general stress response . 1 Taken together , we concluded that our results strongly suggest the involvement of Swa2 in [ URE3 ] propagation . Swa2 Domain Requirements for [ URE3 ] Propagation Swa2 is a multi - domain protein with 3 N - ter - minal clathrin - binding domains , a ubiquitin - associated ( UBA ) domain , a tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR ) domain , and a J - domain ( Fig . 1 ) . 32 , 41 The clathrin - binding domains bind clathrin during uncoating of the clathrin lattice , however , only one domain is required for suc - cessful clathrin binding in vivo . 32 , 37 , 42 Although the exact biochemical role of the UBA domain is unknown , it presumably interacts with ubiqui - tinated cargo proteins during clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 37 , 43 In its C - terminal half , Swa2 contains a TPR domain , comprised of 3 tetratri - copeptide repeats . TPR domains typically facilitate protein - protein interactions but the physiological binding partner ( s ) of Swa2’s TPR domain are unknown . 37 The TPR domain is fol - lowed by the J - domain at the extreme C - termi - nus , which is an unusual placement as all other cytosolic J - proteins from S . cerevisiae contain N - terminal J - domains . 31 , 32 , 44 To further explore the potential role of Swa2 in [ URE3 ] propaga - tion , we ﬁrst determined the minimal regions of Swa2 required for continued propagation of [ URE3 ] . 1 Because of Swa2’s role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , we initially hypothesized that Swa2’s involvement in [ URE3 ] propagation was mostly likely associated with an uncharac - terized clathrin - mediated process . To address this idea , we conducted a “plasmid shufﬂing” experiment wherein we transformed our plas - mid - shufﬂing strain with plasmids bearing indi - vidual , well - characterized deletions of Swa2’s N - terminal domains , and selected against cells expressing the plasmid encoding full - length Swa2 ( Fig . 1 ) . 1 , 37 , 45 Surprisingly , [ URE3 ] was maintained in all N - terminally truncated FIGURE 1 . Primary sequence diagrams of Swa2 constructs and chimeras examined for [ URE3 ] propagation . Swa2 mutants were tested using plasmid - shufﬂing experiments . 1 Domains are denoted using the following notation : CB 1 – 3 , clathrin - binding domains 1 – 3 ; UBA , ubiquitin associated domain ; TPR , tetratricopeptide repeat domain ; J , J domain ; 37 AuxJ , J - domain of human auxilin ; Sis1J , J domain of yeast Sis1 .

Oliver et al . constructs assayed , including a construct lacking all 3 clathrin - binding domains and the UBA domain . Based on these results , we concluded that it is highly unlikely that Swa2’s role in [ URE3 ] propagation involves clathrin . 1 We next examined the requirement of Swa2’s two C - terminal domains , focusing ﬁrst on the TPR domain . A well - studied full - length mutant construct , previously referred to as Swa2 - tpr , 37 consists of a single glycine - to - argi - nine mutation ( Gly 388 ! Arg ) that is predicted to impede binding to client peptides due to dis - ruption of a structurally conserved b - turn between 2 amphipathic helices within the TPR domain . 31 , 37 The Swa2 - tpr mutation is unlikely to affect the overall fold of Swa2 , as this mutant is expressed at normal levels and is still able to bind clathrin and stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssa1 . 31 , 37 Expression of this construct as the sole copy of Swa2 led to loss of [ URE3 ] , indi - cating that Swa2’s TPR domain must be func - tional to support [ URE3 ] propagation . 1 Finally , to examine the importance of a functional J - domain , we expressed a full - length construct bearing a triple alanine substitution ( HPD ! AAA ) in place of the conserved HPD motif that is responsible for stimulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70 ( Fig . 1 ) . This mutant , referred to as Swa2 - j , 37 also expresses normally and , like Swa2 - tpr , failed to support [ URE3 ] propagation when expressed as the only copy of Swa2 . 1 Taken together , these results indicate that the 2 Swa2 C - terminal domains are individually essential and together sufﬁcient for [ URE3 ] propagation . The Swa2 TPR Domain Is Responsible for [ URE3 ] / Swa2 Speciﬁcity One of us ( JKH ) and coworkers previously showed that unlike [ URE3 ] , neither [ RNQ C ] nor a single strong variant of [ PSI C ] require Swa2 for propagation ; 16 however the possibil - ity that other [ PSI C ] variants might require Swa2 remained untested . To address this , we re - examined the potential for a Swa2 require - ment by [ PSI C ] using four more previously untested variants ( two strong and two weak ) . We found no effect of SWA2 deletion on the propagation of these variants , conﬁrming our previous ﬁndings regarding [ PSI C ] and further bolstering the argument that the requirement for Swa2 seems to be speciﬁc for [ URE3 ] . 1 This then raised the question : what is the ori - gin of the speciﬁcity between this single J - pro - tein and this single prion ? To address this , we next asked if there was something speciﬁc , or possibly unique , about Swa2’s J - domain that is required speciﬁcally for [ URE3 ] propaga - tion , or if Swa2’s J - domain is functioning in a generic fashion as has often been observed for other J - domains of other J - proteins . 16 , 17 , 38 , 46 To determine if a speciﬁc structural character - istic within the J - domain is necessary for [ URE3 ] propagation , we created a chimera replacing Swa2’s own J - domain with the J - domain of its human homolog , auxilin ( Swa2 - AuxJ , Fig . 1 ) . Both auxilin and Swa2 contain C - terminal J - domains that include an unusual extra helix and long loop insertion . These characteristics are unique among both yeast cytosolic J - proteins and human J - pro - teins . 44 , 47 As an additional test , we also con - structed a second chimera ( Swa2 - Sis1J ) , using Sis1’s J - domain ( Fig . 1 ) . The J - domain of Sis1 is frequently regarded as generic as it can suc - cessfully replace , or be replaced by , that of Ydj1 in multiple prion and non - prion assays . 17 , 27 , 38 , 46 , 48 - 50 Interestingly , both Swa2 - AuxJ and Swa2 - Sis1J were competent to sup - port [ URE3 ] propagation following plasmid shufﬂing , demonstrating that it is likely the function of a generic J - domain , rather than the unique characteristics of the Swa2 and Auxilin J - domains , that is critical for Swa2’s role in prion propagation . Together with our results described above , these data indicate that Swa2’s TPR domain expressed in cis with a functional J - domain , but not necessarily that of Swa2 , is required for [ URE3 ] propagation . Further , these observations collectively led us to the conclusion that , because only the 2 C - terminal domains of Swa2 are required , and the J - domain can be replaced by J - domains from other J - proteins ( both orthologous and paralogous ) , the Swa2 TPR domain alone must determine the speciﬁcity of the presently unique genetic interaction between Swa2 and [ URE3 ] . 1 J - PROTEIN FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICITY IN PRION BIOLOGY 177 Analysis of the Swa2 TPR Domain TPR motifs are common repeat sequences present in a wide range of proteins and organ - isms . The motif is deﬁned by a varying set of tandem arrays containing a canonical sequence of 34 amino acids which is entirely absent of invariant residues . 51 , 52 Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ( BLAST ) comparisons reveal that the TPR domain of Swa2 bears sig - niﬁcant resemblance to the TPR domains of human Hsp70 - Hsp90 Organizing Protein ( HOP ) : 27 % identity ( E D 6 £ 10 ¡ 13 ) to TPR1 and 23 % identity ( E D 1 £ 10 ¡ 5 ) to TPR2A . The TPR1 and TPR2A domains of HOP bind the C - terminal EEVD motifs of Hsc70 and Hsp90 , respectively , with a high degree of speciﬁcity . We examined 2 individ - ual crystal structures ( PDB IDs : 1ELW and 1ELR ) of these domains in complex with their respective heptapeptide ( Hsc70 ) or pentapep - tide ( Hsp90 ) ligands 53 for critical intermolecu - lar interactions responsible for docking stability . These residues were assessed for conservation in the Swa2 TPR domain using the protein sequencing tools CLUSTALW and LALIGN . Alignments against TPR1 reveal conservation of K 8 , N 43 , A 46 , K 73 , and R 77 as well as the potentially functional conservation of L 15 ! F 385 . Alignments against TPR2A reveal conservation of K 229 , Y 248 , N 264 , A 267 , K 301 and R 305 as well as potentially functional conservation of Q 298 ! K 452 and N 308 ! R 475 ( for details see Table 1 ) . Of particular note is the nearly complete conservation of residues necessary to form the “dicarboxylate clamp” , the characteristic structure known to bind the dicarboxylate formed at the C - terminus of pro - teins ending in EEVD or EEVD - like motifs . This strongly supports the idea that Swa2 pos - sesses sufﬁcient structure to bind a C - terminal EEVD or EEVD - like acidic sequence at its TPR domain . Are there structural aspects of the Swa2 TPR domain that might indicate whether it would be competent to bind Hsp70 vs . Hsp90 in vivo ? It has been suggested that the ability of TPR regions to distinguish between client proteins is established by unique hydrophobic pockets that interact with residues upstream of the EEVD - like motifs . 20 In the case of HOP TPR1 , A 46 , A 49 , F 84 , the g - carbon of K 50 , and the b - carbon of E 83 form a hydrophobic pocket for I ¡ 5 and P ¡ 7 ( numbered by convention from the C - ter - minal D 0 residue ) of the Hsc70 C - terminus . Conservation of residues A 46 , K 50 , and E 83 , and nearly conserved residues A 49 ! L 423 and F 84 ! H 479 in Swa2 suggest that its TPR region is capable to accommodate Hsp70 through similar interactions . In the case of HOP TPR2A , Y 236 and the g - carbon of E 271 form a small hydrophobic pocket around M ¡ 5 of the Hsp90 C - terminus . Swa2 appears to also retain sufﬁcient hydrophobic structure ( Y 236 ! F 385 ) and residue chain length ( E 271 ! K 424 ) to accommodate the Hsp90 M ¡ 5 and thus might be competent for binding either Hsp90 or Hsp70 according to these sequence analyses alone . These structure - based alignments also pro - vided candidate residues for point mutation experiments to test TPR function in vivo . Using these sequence analyses , we identiﬁed targets for single point mutations which would elimi - nate critical salt bridges between the putative dicarboxylate clamp of Swa2 and a C - terminal EEVD - like acidic sequence in a theoretical binding partner . For this purpose , Lys 468 and Lys 378 , both of which are expected to mediate strong ionic ( salt - bridge ) interactions with the C - terminal residue of a putative binding part - ner , 54 were changed to Ala by site - directed mutagenesis in the context of either full - length Swa2 or Swa2 D 2 – 362 . 1 These alterations pro - duced a barely detectable color phenotype change in the context of full - length Swa2 . However , in the context of Swa2 D 2 – 362 , both mutant constructs caused a dramatic destabili - zation of [ URE3 ] when expressed as the sole copy of Swa2 ( Fig . 2A ) . The fact that 2 indi - vidual single amino acid substitutions each independently destabilize [ URE3 ] makes it unlikely that the effect of these mutations are due to large - scale alterations of Swa2 or TPR domain structure . Likewise , the observation that these point - mutations destabilize the prion to such a great extent strongly supports the idea that the formation of a functional clamp inter - action between the Swa2 TPR and the C - termi - nal EEVD - like motif of an as yet unknown 178 E . E . Oliver et al . protein binding partner is critical for stable [ URE3 ] propagation . What is the identity of the relevant Swa2 binding partner ? In a previous investigation we proposed two plausible models for the function of the Swa2 TPR domain . 1 The ﬁrst was that the TPR domain binds the EEVD motif of the Hsp70 Ssa , forming a bipartite interaction that could enhance ﬁber fragmentation via repeated binding and release of the J - domain of Swa2 by Ssa’s N - terminal ATPase domain . In this model , the association of the Swa2 TPR domain with the Hsp70 C - terminal EEVD effectively increases the local J - domain con - centration in the immediate vicinity of the Hsp70 N - terminal domain , which would greatly accelerate the forward portion of the Hsp70 ATPase cycle . The second model asserted that the Swa2 TPR domain binds a C - terminal EEVD or EEVD - like acidic sequence of a different chaperone partner forming a ter - nary complex with Hsp70 binding at the J - domain . These two models are not mutually exclusive ; that is , it is highly likely that Swa2 would engage in a bipartite interaction when either the J or TPR domain is engaged with Ssa , however an additional binding partner for the Swa2 TPR domain , in addition to Ssa , may also exist . Although there are many possible candidates , two became immediately apparent to us : Hsp90 and Hsp104 , which both contain C - terminal motifs that might participate in such an interaction . As described previously , the Hsp90 C - terminus ends with an EEVD motif and Swa2’s TPR motif is highly similar to the Hsp90 - binding TPR2A of the HOP protein . The Hsp104 C - terminus ends with a DDLD sequence capable of binding TPR motifs , 55 , 56 and is therefore also a possible binding candi - date . The hypothesis that Hsp104 is the relevant binding partner is highly intriguing because a plausible role for Swa2 in ﬁber fragmentation would then be immediately apparent : if Swa2 were able to dock both Hsp104 and Hsp70 , it could promote prion fragmentation by directly recruiting additional Hsp104 to Hsp70 already engaged at [ URE3 ] aggregates . To test this hypothetical model , we replaced Hsp104 in [ URE3 ] cells with a plasmid ( pMR40 from Reidy and Masison , 2010 ) expressing Hsp104 lacking the C - terminal DDLD motif which is known to bind to the TPR1 domains of Sti1 ( the yeast homolog of mammalian HOP ) and the Hsp90 co - chaperone Cpr7 in S . cerevisiae . 22 , 55 - 57 This construct , here called Hsp104 D DDLD , supports strong [ PSI C ] propagation similar to wild - type pro - tein . 22 We were able to easily isolate strains ( n D 7 of 8 examined ) that stably maintained [ URE3 ] with Hsp104 D DDLD as the sole copy TABLE 1 .

Hsp90 as a Plausible Binding Partner for Swa2 in [ URE3 ] Propagation Initially , we disfavored the idea of a ter - nary complex with Hsp90 for two reasons , the ﬁrst of which was the greater similarity of the Swa2 TPR domain to HOP TPR1 ( which binds Hsc70 ) rather than TPR2A ( which binds Hsp90 ) . The second was that , should such a complex exist , alterations of Hsp90 ( speciﬁ - cally ) or Hsp90 co - chaperones ( plausibly ) should greatly impact [ URE3 ] similar to alter - ations in Swa2 , yet no evidence indicating Hsp90 involvement in [ URE3 ] propagation was present in the literature at the time of our original publication . We posited that the most direct test of this hypothesis would be to ablate the EEVD motif of Hsp90 and examine the effect on [ URE3 ] propagation as we did with Hsp104 . However , a recent study by the Sharma laboratory ( Kumar et al . 2015 ) , coin - cident with our own , serendipitously did exactly that , providing considerable additional support for this alternative model . Most nota - bly , the authors demonstrated novel genetic interactions between Hsp90 and one of its co - chaperones , and [ URE3 ] . 20 Moreover , their results speciﬁcally implicated the Hsp90 EEVD motif , but not other functions of Hsp90 . Normally Hsp90 exists as a homo - dimer with the dimer interface located in the C - terminal domains , and exhibits pincer - type conformational changes via cycling between bound and unbound states at its N - terminal nucleotide binding domains , mediated by ATP hydrolysis . 58 , 59 Kumar et al . demon - strated that neither inhibition of Hsp90 FIGURE 2 . Residues of Swa2’s TPR domain , but not Hsp104’s C - terminal DDLD motif , are required for [ URE3 ] propagation . ( A ) Haploid [ URE3 ] cells of the W303 genetic background expressing His3 in place of genomic Swa2 and bearing the plasmid pRS416 – SWA2 were trans - formed with plasmids ( pRS315 ) expressing Swa2 variant constructs lacking the Swa2 N - terminal domains and containing a single amino acid substitution ( K 378 ! A or K 468 ! A ) . Swa2 - D 2 – 362 and swa2 - D were used as positive and negative controls for prion maintenance , respectively . Colonies exhibiting leucine prototrophy were placed on media containing 5 - Fluoroorotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) to counter - select against the URA3 - marked SWA2 plasmid . Red / white color phenotype assays are shown for representative transformants ( n (cid:2) 8 for each variant ) ; in this yeast genetic background red pigment accumulates upon [ URE3 ] loss . ( B ) Haploid W303 [ URE3 ] cells possessing genomic HSP104 were crossed with one of 2 strains expressing Leu2 in place of genomic Hsp104 , and expressing either wild - type Hsp104 ( pRS313 , row 1 ) or an Hsp104 construct lacking its 4 terminal residues : DDLD ( pRS314 , rows 2 and 3 ) . 22 After passage on media selecting for adenine and leu - cine prototrophy , diploids were sporulated and subjected to tetrad dissection . Color phenotype assays are shown for representative haploids ( right columns , n (cid:2) 7 ) . Haploids were subsequently treated with GdnHCl to inhibit Hsp104 function ( left columns , n (cid:2) 7 for each variant ) , to conﬁrm that colony color still accurately reported prion status . 180 E . E . Oliver et al . ATPase function nor removal of the charged linker region responsible for the pincer - type conformational change had any effect on [ URE3 ] propagation . However , deletion of the C - terminal MEEVD pentapeptide signiﬁ - cantly destabilized [ URE3 ] , suggesting a novel role for Hsp90 in [ URE3 ] maintenance which is independent of ATPase activity and its normal chaperone functions . Furthermore , they demonstrated that the Hsp90 co - chaper - one Cpr7 binds to Ure2 in pull - down assays and similarly reduces [ URE3 ] stability when deleted . Finally , like our results with Swa2 , they found no evidence of similar effects on weak or strong [ PSI C ] variants indicating that these effects are speciﬁc to [ URE3 ] . 20 These new data from both our laboratories , which simultaneously implicate Hsp90 and exonerate Hsp104 , lend signiﬁcant support toward a model in which Swa2 aids in [ URE3 ] propagation via simultaneous docking of Hsp70 at its J - domain and Hsp90 at its TPR domain . Interestingly , such a model must also explain the need for Hsp90 but without the need for Hsp90 conformational change or ATP hydroly - sis . Here we propose a new model that accounts for all available data in which an Hsp90 dimer acts as a passive bridge bringing together multi - ple proteins via its 2 C - terminal domains to assemble a protein complex that could directly recruit Hsp104 to [ URE3 ] ﬁbers ( Fig . 3 ) . This model assumes that the ability of Cpr7 to bind soluble Ure2 extends to Ure2 in [ URE3 ] amy - loids ; an assertion that seems likely given that Ure2 remains at least partially functional in [ URE3 ] aggregates . 60 , 61 By virtue of its dual MEEVD motifs , Hsp90 could bind the Cpr7 (cid:2) [ URE3 ] complex at one C - terminal MEEVD motif via the Cpr7 TPR domain while simulta - neously docking the Swa2 (cid:2) Hsp70 complex at the second , nearby C - terminal MEEVD motif via the Swa2 TPR domain ( Fig . 3 ) . This multi - protein complex would bring together the [ URE3 ] aggregate and Hsp70 , allowing Hsp70 to remodel polypeptides from the aggregate and recruit Hsp104 for disaggregation . Thus the complex would effectively recruit additional Hsp104 directly to [ URE3 ] ﬁbrils in a produc - tive fashion through Hsp70 , enhancing aggre - gate remodeling by increasing the number of sites available for ﬁber fragmentation . Deletion or mutation of any of these factors would be expected to result in prion instability , which is fully consistent with the current literature . It is also worth noting that because Cpr7 can also bind Hsp104 directly , 56 it may have a second function , independent of its action with Swa2 and Hsp90 in which it recruits Hsp104 directly to [ URE3 ] aggregates by binding the DDLD motif of Hsp104 at its TPR domain . However , our experiment described above ( Fig . 2B ) clari - ﬁes that this second possible role for Cpr7 can - not be its major function in [ URE3 ] maintenance since Cpr7 deletion results in prion loss but deletion of the Hsp104 DDLD motif does not , lending additional support for the model that Cpr7 acts primarily through Hsp90 . Future Directions and Current Limitations It is reasonable to suggest that [ URE3 ] might require additional chaperone complexes to increase sites of ﬁber fragmentation for contin - ued propagation relative to other prions . [ URE3 ] has been repeatedly characterized by relatively large intracellular aggregates and low propagon numbers , likely making it difﬁ - cult for the prion to be fragmented and passed into progeny relative to other prions like [ PSI C ] . This idea is also consistent with numer - ous observations that [ URE3 ] is highly sensi - tive to reductions in chaperone activity , particularly with regard to Sis1 and Hsp104 . 16 , 27 , 62 , 63 The model we propose herein makes many new testable predictions . First , the model asserts that Cpr7 binds to [ URE3 ] aggregates in addition to monomeric Ure2 . Second , this model would predict that alterations that block the proposed binding between Swa2 and Hsp90 would reduce Hsp104 recruitment to [ URE3 ] , a testable hypothesis , as is the hypothesis that Swa2 interacts directly with Hsp90 . As already noted above , deletion or mutation of any of these chaperones or co - chaperones in a way that reduces their relevant functions would destabilize the prion , which is already consis - tent with the current literature . The expected J - PROTEIN FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICITY IN PRION BIOLOGY 181 consequence of this reduction , however , would be an increase in aggregate size and decrease in propagon numbers before possible loss of the prion . Difﬁculties with testing this hypothesis are that [ URE3 ] propagon numbers are already very low and aggregates very large relative to other prions , so it may be challenging to observe these expected changes without fully destabilizing the prion . One additional chal - lenge is that methods to observe size changes for [ URE3 ] aggregates are limited as [ URE3 ] is known to become unstable in the presence of long - term ectopic Ure2 or Ure2 - GFP expres - sion , 64 and a reliable method to resolve [ URE3 ] aggregates by using semi - denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis ( SDDAGE ) has yet to be published . Ongoing efforts to establish alternative methods to follow [ URE3 ] aggre - gates may resolve some of these issues and may ultimately lead to a more complete bio - chemical understanding of why some prions , but not others , require speciﬁc sets of chaper - ones for propagation .

Hsp70 is recruited to [ URE3 ] aggregates by formation of a chaperone bridge . Cpr7 , bound to the aggregate , complexes with the EEVD of one Hsp90 monomer at its TPR domain while Swa2 , bound to Hsp70 at its J - domain , complexes with the EEVD of the other Hsp90 mono - mer via the Swa2 TPR domain . This multi - chaperone protein complex allows Hsp70 to productively recruit Hsp104 and enhance prion fragmentation . 182 E . E .
