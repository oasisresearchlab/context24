The maximum of global daily new cases have exceeded 1 , 000 , 000 , and situations in many countries are increasingly aggravating . It is pressing to ﬁ nd ef ﬁ cient ways to suppress the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 2 – 11 , which has been recognized as top priority since the very beginning of the initial outbreak in China and reiterated by the multidisciplinary online conference on 3 August 2020 , organized by the World Health Organization 12 . Recently , resurgences of COVID - 19 have been reported in many countries ( e . g . , United Kingdom , France , Spain ) . When a local resurgence takes place 13 – 15 , a fundamental issue for practical control and prevention is how does COVID - 19 spread temporally and spatially within a city ? Many works have explained the differences in contagion rates due to the urban socio - political measures . Manzira et al . presents a strong relationship between modes of transporta - tion ( such as traf ﬁ c volume , bus passengers , pedestrians , and cyclists ) and reported COVID - 19 infections 16 . Lak et al . suggested that the demographic composition and major neighborhood - level physical attributes are important factors explaining high infection rates and mortality 17 . Ma et al . revealed the policy of mask use in controlling the transmission of COVID - 19 18 . Existing works focusing on the spreading pattern of COVID - 19 can be summarized into two categories based on the spatial scale : the spreading of COVID - 19 within a speci ﬁ c city or between different cities or countries . Considering spreading within a speci ﬁ c city , Hamidi found that the metropolitan population is one of the most signi ﬁ cant predictors of infection rates 19 . Acuto et al . proposed that urban equality can engender healthier and more sustainable societies 20 . Shari ﬁ et al . introduced the impacts of COVID - 19 on environmental quality , socio - economic impacts , management and governance , and transportation and urban design 21 . Gaisie argued that the evolution of the COVID - 19 through built environment attributes such as diversity , destination accessibility , distance to transit , design , and density 22 . For spreading between cities , the relatively wide COVID - 19 spreading pattern focuses on the inter - country , inter - state , or inter - districts spreading pattern of diseases . Due to the lack of ﬁ ne - grained data , previous works 23 – 25 are always not able to compare with real data of con ﬁ rmed cases and medical virus detection can not track the daily trajectory of ten thousands or more con ﬁ rmed cases . They fall short on studying ﬁ ne - grained urban transmission dynamics of COVID - 19 , one of the most critical spreading characteristics . Here , we ﬁ ll this gap by leveraging the trajectory data of 197 , 808 smartphone users ( including 17 , 808 anonymous con - ﬁ rmed cases ) in 9 cities in China . To have a comprehensive analysis , we select con ﬁ rmed cases from Wuhan ( where the initial outbreak of COVID - 19 took place in China ) , Beijing and Urumqi ( the cities with COVID - 19 resurgences ) and other cities ( where cases were mainly imported ) . We explain the spreading process through the following three aspects : ( 1 ) The general spreading pattern of COVID - 19 in different cities ; ( 2 ) The underlying mechanism for the spreading pattern of COVID - 19 ; ( 3 ) The utilization of the spreading pattern for control and prevention of COVID - 19 . We ﬁ nd a general spreading pattern existing in all cities : the spatial distribution of con ﬁ rmed cases follows a truncated power - law - like model and the spreading centroid is time - invariant . Moreover , we reveal that long average traveling distance results in a high growth rate of spreading radius and 1 College of Control Science and Engineering , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China . 2 Westlake Institute for Data Intelligence , Hangzhou , China . 3 College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China . 4 Key Laboratory of Collaborative sensing and autonomous unmanned systems of Zhejiang Province , Hangzhou , China . 5 School of Medicine , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China . 6 Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention , Hangzhou , China . 7 Shenzhen Finance Institute , School of Management and Economics , The Chinese University of Hong Kong , Shenzhen , China . 8 Center for Polymer Studies and Physics Department , Boston University , Boston , MA 02215 , USA . ✉ email : s18he @ zju . edu . cn ; cjm @ zju . edu . cn www . nature . com / npjUrbanSustain Published in partnership with RMIT University 1234567890 ( ) : , ; wide spatial diffusion of con ﬁ rmed cases in the ﬁ ne - grained geographic model . With such insight , we can accurately predict the shapes of spatial distribution of cases and the time when the peak of COVID - 19 cases arrives . Our results unveil the underlying mechanism behind the spatial - temporal urban evolution of COVID - 19 , and can be used to evaluate the performance of mobility restriction policies implemented by many governments and to estimate the evolving spreading situation of COVID - 19 . RESULTS The temporal spreading pattern We display the difference between the overall spreading centroid and cumulative spreading centroid until i th period in Fig . 1a , c , and e for Wuhan , Beijing , and Urumqi , respectively . Interestingly , as the situation of COVID - 19 evolves , cumulative spreading centroids at different periods in Wuhan , Beijing , and Urumqi are close to the overall spreading centroid : the mean absolute errors ( MAE ) between cumulative and overall spreading centroids in Wuhan , Beijing , and Urumqi are 0 . 3 Km , 0 . 4 Km , and 0 . 7 Km , respectively . It is clear to see that the temporal spreading centroid of COVID - 19 has a feature of time invariance . That is , the spreading centroid is stable and nearly does not migrate during COVID - 19 spreading . We also conduct analysis for the other six cities with a relatively large number of con ﬁ rmed cases in China : Xiaogan , Suizhou , Xiangyang , Huanggang , Guangzhou , and Wenzhou ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 6 ) , where cases are mainly imported . Similar conclusions for spreading centroid and spreading radius can be made in these cities . We proceed to perform sensitivity analysis by varying the number of spreading period L ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) and ﬁ nd that L does not have much impact on the observed temporal pattern . Therefore , the temporal spreading pattern of COVID - 19 in China features time invariance of spreading centroid and slow growth of spreading radius . As can be seen in Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 4 , there are signi ﬁ cant disparities in growth rate of spreading radius in different cities and different time periods . To ﬁ nd intrinsic mechanisms for these disparities , we ﬁ rst divide the spreading period T ( T in Beijing for instance lasted from June 11 to July 10 with 30 days ) of each city into two periods L 1 and L 2 ( L 1 in Beijing for instance lasted from June 11 to June 25 with 15 days ) . Then , two spreading radii ( R 1 and R 2 ) can be calculated based on activity centroids of con ﬁ rmed cases reported in the spreading periods L 1 and L 2 , respectively . We de ﬁ ne the growth rate of spreading radius as 2 ( R 2 − R 1 ) / ∣ T ∣ , where ∣ T ∣ denotes number of days in spreading period T . Further , we randomly select 20 , 000 smartphone users in each city and leverage their trajectory data during the outbreak of COVID - 19 to compute their mean travel distance . Since these smartphone users are randomly selected , we use this mean distance ( over 20 , 000 users ) to approximate that of all citizens in each city . Clearly , a large value of mean travel distance re ﬂ ects a strong willingness of people for long - distance travelling . Con - sidering that different control measures imposed in Wuhan and Urumqi since the outbreak of COVID - 19 affected the correspond - ing mobility pattern and spreading of pandemic signi ﬁ cantly ( Fig . 2d , e ) , we divide the spreading period of these two cities into two sub - periods : before and after the implementation of travel restriction , and then calculate mean travel distance and growth rate of spreading radius in these two sub - periods , respectively . The correlation analysis results for all nine cities are illustrated in Fig . 1g . Interestingly , we observe a clear positive correlation between mean travel distance and growth rate of spreading radius , indicating that mobility pattern accelerates the urban spreading of COVID - 19 . The spatial spreading pattern To characterize and visualize spatial spreading pattern , we divide the geographical area into grids of 1 Km × 1 Km 26 . The overall spreading centroid is set as the original point of grids . Con ﬁ rmed cases of COVID - 19 are then projected into grids according to their activity centroids . As illustrated in Fig . 2a – c , three - dimensional histograms are used to describe the spatial distributions of con ﬁ rmed cases in Wuhan , Beijing , and Urumqi , respectively , where the height of each bar represents the case count in each grid . To analyze the spatial distribution function F ( d ) , driven by human mobility pattern , we apply the logarithm to the actual distribution of human mobility pattern as well as the number of con ﬁ rmed cases and the distance from the overall spreading centroid in all cities . The human mobility distributions and spatial distributions F ( d ) of Beijing , Urumqi , Xiaogan , Suizhou , and Huanggang exhibit a prominent linear pattern ( Fig . 2d – i , Supplementary Figs . 6 and 7 ) . Although a signi ﬁ cant change in human mobility patterns in Wuhan ( Jan . 23 ) and Urumqi ( Jul . 16 ) after control measures can be observed intuitively , corresponding human mobility distributions and spatial distributions in these cities are surprisingly demonstrated as power - law model . Therefore , we adopt F ( d ) = d α for linear regression . Speci ﬁ cally , we have α = − 1 . 80 for Beijing ( the Pearson correlation : − 0 . 93 ) and α = − 2 . 15 for Urumqi ( the Pearson correlation : − 0 . 93 ) , respectively . As shown in Fig . 2g , the spatial distribution of con ﬁ rmed cases in Wuhan is power - law - like since it deviates slightly from power - law model when d is small . Due to the in ﬂ uence of human mobility patterns in Wuhan during the lockdown period ( Fig . 2d ) , initial cases have a higher probability to infect susceptible individuals around the spreading centroid . As a result , the risk of infection around spreading centroid is much higher than that at Fig . 1 The temporal spreading pattern of COVID - 19 . a – f The cumulative spreading centroid and spreading radius in Wuhan , Beijing , and Urumqi , respectively . g Relation between the mean travel distance of people in each city and the corresponding COVID - 19 growth rate . H . Zhang et al . 2 npj Urban Sustainability ( 2023 ) 3 Published in partnership with RMIT University 1234567890 ( ) : , ; distant locations ( a signi ﬁ cant 92 % of cases are close to the spreading centroid ) . To have a more accurate quanti ﬁ cation of the spatial distribution of Wuhan , we divide the area into two parts by their distance to the spreading centroid , and adopt two different models to ﬁ t the data . Speci ﬁ cally , spatial distribution of con ﬁ rmed cases around the spreading centroid ( d ≤ 18 ) is ﬁ tted by an exponential model F ( d ) = α d , and when d > 18 is ﬁ tted by a power - law model . As illustrated in Fig . 2g , F ( d ) , d ≤ 18 is well ﬁ tted by an exponential model with a Pearson correlation of − 0 . 99 , and F ( d ) , d > 18 is well ﬁ tted by a power - law model with a Pearson correlation of − 0 . 96 . This indicates that the spatial distribution of con ﬁ rmed cases in Wuhan indeed has different characteristics , depending on the distance to the spreading centroid . We also observe a similar phenomenon in Xiangyang ( Supplementary Fig . 7f ) . Interestingly , we ﬁ nd that this is mainly determined by human mobility pattern ( to be elaborated on in the next Section ) . We also notice that for cities ( such as Guangzhou and Wenzhou ) where imported cases are widely scattered , the spatial spreading pattern is less prominent . It is clear that there are multiple clusters of con ﬁ rmed cases in these two cities ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , which impacts the power - law - like spatial spreading . Therefore , the observed spreading pattern does not apply to the case with multiple infection sources . The underlying mechanism The classic susceptible - infected - recovered model ( SIR ) and its variants have been widely adopted to understand the transmis - sion characteristics of infectious diseases . The Kendall model 27 – 29 introduces the spatial dimension to the SIR model and can be used to explain the spatial - temporal evolution of infectious diseases . Its differential equations can be expressed as equations ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) of supplementary materials . Note that con ﬁ rmed cases in China get isolated for medical treatment once they are con ﬁ rmed and would not cause further infection . Under such a condition , the con ﬁ rmed cases can be regarded as recovered individuals in the Kendall model . Then , the differential equation for the proportion of recovered individuals can be written as ∂ R ∂ t ¼ (cid:2) λ R ð x ; t Þ þ λ I 0 ð x Þ þ λ 1 (cid:2) exp (cid:2) 1 λ Z 1 (cid:2)1 R ð y ; t Þ K ð x (cid:2) y Þ d y (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) : ( 1 ) where R ( x , t ) denotes the proportion of recovered individuals at location x and time t , satisfying R ( x , 0 ) = 0 . Note that λ can be obtained by inverse of the basic regeneration number R 0 in the model , that is , λ = 1 / R 0 = γ / βξ , where γ , β , ξ represents recovery rate , infection rate and the number of initial susceptible individuals , respectively . Besides , the kernel function K ( x − y ) > 0 , satisfying R 1(cid:2)1 K ð y Þ d y ¼ 1 , quanti ﬁ es the probability that an infected individual at location y visits x . Here , we use power - law distribution to describe the city - level movement behaviors 30 , which can be written as K ( Δ r ) = Δ r η . Hereby , K ( Δ r ) represents the probability for the step size Δ r and η , the power - law exponential , denotes the travel willingness , which has a strong correlation with the mean traveling distance . To ﬁ t the model for recovered individuals , we ﬁ rst calculate the parameter η in the power - law distribution by utilizing the mobility data of anonymous smartphone users , with which to capture the inherent human movement behaviors for each city . Moreover , the diagnosed date for each con ﬁ rmed case and corresponding activity centroid is also calculated as input of the model . Through ﬁ tting the model ( i . e . , equation ( 1 ) ) based on these precalculated parameters and Least Squares algorithm , we can ﬁ nally obtain a set of optimal parameters ( λ and I 0 ( x ) ) . Note that we assume initial con ﬁ rmed cases originate from the grid ( 0 , 0 ) . The parameter I 0 ( x ) ﬁ tted in the model could therefore be written as I 0 ( 0 , 0 ) .

H . Zhang et al . 3 Published in partnership with RMIT University npj Urban Sustainability ( 2023 ) 3 discussion about Kendall model and parameter ﬁ tting process are provided in supplementary materials . Figure 3a – c illustrate the overall model ﬁ tting performance of recovered individuals R ( x , t ) for Wuhan , Beijing , and Urumqi , in which Root - Mean - Square - Error ( RMSE ) is also added to quantify the performance of model ﬁ tting . The values of RMSE for Wuhan , Beijing , and Urumqi during whole spreading period are 0 . 55 , 0 . 18 and 0 . 57 respectively , indicating that the evolution of recovered individuals R ( x , t ) during spreading period can be well captured by the proposed Kendall model . More results on the performance of model ﬁ tting can be found in Supplementary Fig . 9 . We proceed to study the impact of parameter η in the model on spatial dispersion of con ﬁ rmed cases , the number of daily new con ﬁ rmed cases , and growth rate of spreading radius during the whole spreading period . To characterize the spatial dispersion of con ﬁ rmed cases , we introduce the concept of Simpson Diver - gence : div ¼ 1 = Σ i p 2 i , where p i represents the proportion of con ﬁ rmed cases distributed in grids whose distance to overall spreading centroid is within [ i , i + 1 ] . Therefore , a small value of div re ﬂ ects a high clustering of the con ﬁ rmed cases , i . e . , a large proportion of con ﬁ rmed cases are distributed in a small number of grids . Fig . 3d illustrates the impact of η on spatial dispersion of con ﬁ rmed cases . We consider two scenarios under different basic regeneration number R 0 : R 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1 . We see that , with the decrease of η Simpson Divergence decreases to 1 , at which all con ﬁ rmed cases are distributed in one grid . The impact of η on growth rate of spreading radius is illustrated in Fig . 3g . Clearly , the growth rate of spreading radius decreases with the decrease of η , which is consistent with results in Fig . 3d . Figure 3e and h show the impact of η on the number of daily reported con ﬁ rmed cases . Interestingly , a large η , which means long mean travelling distance in the human mobility model , results in quick spreading of COVID - 19 , which makes the peak of daily reported cases arrives early . This also shows that travel restriction policies will delay the peak arrival . Finally , we study the impact of η on the growth rate of spreading radius . As we can see in Fig . 3f , i , spreading radii under different η increase with time and converge to a ﬁ x value when R 0 > 1 . However , when R 0 < 1 , the spreading radius increases only when η is relatively large . This indicates that when R 0 < 1 and the mean travelling distance is also low , the pandemic will not spread spatially . Therefore , η in the mobility model drives the temporal - spatial spreading process . In practice , we can optimize η by implementing a speci ﬁ c travel restriction policy to have a desired control and prevention performance . DISCUSSION Previous studies investigated the relationship between human mobility and spreading patterns of infectious diseases 31 – 33 , revealing that the number of infected cases at the destination has a strong correlation with the total population and the weighted distance from the source to the destination , which is determined by the corresponding population ﬂ ow . Combining the population ﬂ ow data and epidemic simulation model , these works accurately characterize large - scale spatial - temporal spreading of epidemics 34 and predict future spreading trends 35 – 37 . Since the population ﬂ ow is driven by human mobility , existing works have examined the intrinsic mechanism of how human mobility impacts the spreading of diseases 38 – 40 and provided theoretical insights about how to mitigate transmission of epidemics through travel restriction 41 – 43 .

H . Zhang et al . 4 npj Urban Sustainability ( 2023 ) 3 Published in partnership with RMIT University Interestingly , many urban patterns such as urban growth patterns , human mobility patterns , and income patterns 39 , 44 – 47 follow the power - law distribution model . Since the a strong connection between the human mobility pattern and the spreading pattern , we would intrinsically guest that the spreading pattern has a similar distribution to the human mobility pattern and our result can also be viewed as complementary to the power - law distribution for urban pandemic spreading patterns . Due to the lack of ﬁ ne - grained data , previous works are always not able to compare with real data of con ﬁ rmed cases and medical virus detection can not track the daily trajectory of ten thousand or more con ﬁ rmed cases . Most works need ideal assumptions to reconstruct the whole ﬁ ne - grained spreading process . In this article , we assume that individuals in China are homogeneous in the downtown area ( less than 100 kilometers ) and highly compliance with government regulations during the most severe spreading time ( less than one month ) with a constant infection rate and the same human mobility patterns before and after the lockdown policy . We use the data of con ﬁ rmed cases ’ activity centroids to study the spatial - temporal spreading pattern of COVID - 19 in China . The novelty of our model is based on the trajectory data of anonymous con ﬁ rmed cases and it would complement the previous work and shed light on the ﬁ ne - grained urban transmission dynamics of COVID - 19 . Our model is able to well ﬁ tted the whole process of ﬁ ne - grained spreading pattern and the spatial - temporal spreading pattern of nine cities is stable . Our ﬁ ndings can be used to ﬁ nd the most possible infection center ( spreading centroid ) , evaluate the growth rate , and estimate the infection risk of different communities in a new outbreak of COVID - 19 . Such information is very helpful for practical control and prevention . One limitation of our study is that we do not consider the impact of other social factors on city size , such as civil uprising , disobedience , and other socio - political factors . Instead , we focus on the downtown area and assume that the population is homogenous in those grids . The assumption would neglect the impact of heterogeneous socio - political factors 48 – 50 and the difference in terrain height , especially in the city of Urumqi . It would be a possible intersection for future research . To have a valid conclusion here , we compare with the real trajectory data of anonymous con ﬁ rmed cases and study the spreading pattern of COVID - 19 in 9 cities in China , and the results turn out to be consistent . Therefore , the results have a good approximation of the ﬁ ne - grained spreading process . METHODS Characterize the activity centroids of con ﬁ rmed cases We adopt a collection of trajectory data contributed by anonymous smartphone users in China . The trajectory data records activity locations and corresponding timestamps when smartphone users are using location - based services . Clearly , these data re ﬂ ect the real - time activity locations of smartphone users , at which they might get infected or infect others . To see how the spreading of COVID - 19 is spatially correlated with the activity locations of con ﬁ rmed cases , we ﬁ rst characterize their activity locations by a statistical metric : activity centroid ( denoted by σ ) . The activity centroid of a smartphone user is de ﬁ ned as the average activity locations reported by this smartphone user within a given period ( e . g . , 1 month ) . That is , assuming that there are N j activity locations P j ¼ f P j 1 ; P j 2 ; (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) ; P jN j g for a smartphone user j , the activity centroid σ j for user j , is de ﬁ ned as σ j ¼ E P j (cid:6) (cid:7) ¼ P k P jk = N j . We illustrate the calculation of activity centroid σ in Fig . 4a . The activity centroid should be stable over time for most smartphone users so that it can represent the intrinsic characteristic of activity Fig . 4 Activity centroids and visualization of COVID - 19 spreading in Wuhan . a An illustration of calculating the activity centroids of smartphone users based on their activity locations . b – c The cumulative distributions of the mean and variance of the distance between activity centroids of each smartphone user in 1 – 6 months and the average centroid . d Visualizing the spatial - temporal spreading of COVID - 19 in Wuhan between 22 January 2020 and 27 February 2020 . H . Zhang et al . 5 Published in partnership with RMIT University npj Urban Sustainability ( 2023 ) 3 locations . For this purpose , we randomly select 20 , 000 smartphone users in Wuhan and calculate their activity centroids in different periods ( 1 – 6 months ) , obtaining 6 activity centroids σ j ( t ) , t ∈ [ 1 , 6 ] for each smartphone user j . The distances between 6 activity centroids and the average centroid ( i . e . , σ j ¼ P 6 t ¼ 1 σ j ð t Þ = 6 ) for each j are then calculated . The mean and standard variance of these 6 distances for each user are computed and the cumulative distributions of all smartphone users are displayed in Fig . 4b , c . Clearly , the mean values of 95 . 3 % smartphone users are < 1 . 5 kilometer ( Km ) and the standard variance is relatively small . This implies that the activity locations of smartphone users exhibit strong stability , independent of the chosen period ( see sensitivity analysis of the periods in Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Such an intrinsic behavior can be well captured by the activity centroid . The most frequently visiting location ( MVL ) is also a statistical metric of great interest . It indicates the activity location that a smartphone user visits most frequently . We calculate the percentage of top k ( k = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , 5 ) activity locations of each smartphone user and show the average of all 20 , 000 smartphone users in Supplementary Fig . 2a – c . The MVL ( i . e . , top 1 activity location ) only accounts for about 45 % of all activity locations , that is , more than one - half of activity location information is not utilized by MVL to characterize the activity behavior . Further , the performance of the metric of top k activity locations approaches that of activity centroid when k increases ( see detailed information in Supplementary Fig . 2d – i ) . Therefore , we choose activity centroid as the statistical metric instead of MVL in this article . De ﬁ nition of spreading centroids and spreading radius To characterize the temporal spreading pattern , we divide the spreading duration in each city into L equal periods , and allocate con ﬁ rmed cases in set U into subset U i if their con ﬁ rmation dates are within i th period , i ≤ L . An illustration of division is provided in the x axis index of Fig . 1a , c , e , where L = 10 . Given a set U of all con ﬁ rmed cases , we are able to calculate the overall spreading centroid ( denoted by ρ ) of U as the average of their activity centroids , i . e . , ρ ¼ E ð σ Þ , where σ ¼ f σ j g j 2 U . The cumulative spreading centroid is then de ﬁ ned as corresponding cumulative value until i th period , that is , the averages of activity centroids of con ﬁ rmed cases in set S ik ¼ 1 U k . We now study the spreading radius γ of set U , de ﬁ ned as γ = ∑ j ∈ U d ( σ j , ρ ) / ∣ U ∣ , where d ( ⋅ ) is the Euclidean distance between the activity centroid of a con ﬁ rmed case and the spreading centroid ρ of a set U of con ﬁ rmed cases , and ∣ U ∣ denotes the number of con ﬁ rmed cases in U . Obviously , the spreading radius quanti ﬁ es the mean distance between con ﬁ rmed cases ’ activity centroids and the spreading centroid . Similarly , we introduce a cumulative spreading radius for set S ik ¼ 1 U i . The cumulative spreading radius in different periods increases slowly over time in these three cities except for periods with few cases ( < 10 cases ) . By collaborating with Westlake Institute for Data Intelligence and local institutions for disease control and prevention , we obtain a dataset of con ﬁ rmed cases who are also smartphone users for location - based services , including their activity centroids and dates of con ﬁ rmation ( see details on the data described in supplementary materials ) . We visualize the spreading process of COVID - 19 in Wuhan through a heat map in Fig . 4d . The introduction of activity centroid enables us to quantify the spatial and temporal spreading pattern of COVID - 19 in the following sections .
