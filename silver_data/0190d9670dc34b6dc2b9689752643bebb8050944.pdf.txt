Here , we characterize SpCas9 targeting specificity in human cells to inform the selection of target sites and avoid off - target effects . Our study evaluates > 700 guide RNA variants and SpCas9 - induced indel mutation levels at > 100 predicted genomic off - target loci in 293T and 293FT cells . We find that SpCas9 tolerates mismatches between guide RNA and target DNA at different positions in a sequence - dependent manner , sensitive to the number , position and distribution of mismatches . We also show that SpCas9 - mediated cleavage is unaffected by DNA methylation and that the dosage of © 2013 Nature America , Inc . All rights reserved . Correspondence should be addressed to F . Z .

To facilitate mammalian genome engineering applications , we provide a web - based software tool to guide the selection and validation of target sequences as well as off - target analyses . The bacterial type II clustered , regularly interspaced , short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) system from S . pyogenes can be reconstituted in mammalian cells using three minimal components 1 : the CRISPR - associated nuclease Cas9 ( SpCas9 ) , a specificity - determining CRISPR RNA ( crRNA ) , and an auxiliary trans - activating crRNA ( tracrRNA ) 11 . Following crRNA and tracrRNA hybridization , SpCas9 is targeted to genomic loci matching a 20 - nt guide sequence within the crRNA , immediately upstream of a required 5 ′ - NGG protospacer adjacent motif ( PAM ) 11 . crRNA and tracrRNA duplexes can also be fused to generate a chimeric sgRNA 12 that mimics the natural crRNA - tracrRNA hybrid . Both crRNA - tracrRNA duplexes and sgRNAs can be used to target SpCas9 for multiplexed genome editing in eukaryotic cells 1 , 3 . Although an sgRNA design consisting of a truncated crRNA and tracrRNA had been previously shown to mediate efficient cleavage in vitro 12 , it failed to achieve detectable cleavage at several loci that were efficiently modified by crRNA - tracrRNA duplexes bearing identical guide sequences 1 . Because the major difference between this sgRNA design and the native crRNA - tracrRNA duplex is the length of the tracrRNA sequence , we tested whether extension of the tracrRNA tail would improve SpCas9 activity . We generated a set of sgRNAs targeting multiple sites within the human EMX1 and PVALB loci with different tracrRNA 3 ′ truncations ( Fig . 1a ) . Using the SURVEYOR nuclease assay 13 , we assessed the ability of each Cas9 - sgRNA complex to generate indels in human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293FT cells through the induction of DNA doublestranded breaks ( DSBs ) and subsequent nonhomologous end joining ( NHEJ ) DNA damage repair ( Online Methods ) . sgRNAs with + 67 or + 85 nucleotide ( nt ) tracrRNA tails mediated DNA cleavage at all target sites tested , with up to fivefold higher levels of indels than the corresponding crRNA - tracrRNA duplexes ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Furthermore , both sgRNA designs efficiently modified PVALB loci that were previously not targetable using crRNA - tracrRNA duplexes 1 ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . For all five tested targets , we observed a consistent increase in modification efficiency with increasing tracrRNA length . We performed northern blot analyses for the guide RNA truncations and found increased levels of expression for the longer tracrRNA sequences , suggesting that improved target cleavage was at least partially due to higher sgRNA expression or stability ( Fig . 1c ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the tracrRNA tail is important for optimal SpCas9 expression and activity in vivo . We further investigated the sgRNA architecture by extending the duplex length from 12 to the 22 nt found in the native crRNA - tracrRNA duplex ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . We also mutated the sequence encoding the sgRNAs to abolish any poly - T tracts that could serve as premature transcriptional terminators for U6 - driven transcription 14 . We tested these new sgRNA scaffolds on three targets within the human EMX1 gene ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) and observed only modest changes in modification efficiency . Thus , we established Hsu et al . Page 2 Nat Biotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t sgRNA ( + 67 ) as a minimum effective SpCas9 guide RNA architecture and for all subsequent studies we used the most active sgRNA ( + 85 ) architecture . We have previously shown that a catalytic mutant of SpCas9 ( D10A nickase ) can mediate gene editing by homology - directed repair without detectable indel formation 1 . Given its higher cleavage efficiency , we tested whether sgRNA ( + 85 ) , in complex with the Cas9 nickase , can likewise facilitate homology - directed repair without incurring on - target NHEJ . Using single - stranded oligonucleotides as repair templates , we observed that both the wild - type and the D10A SpCas9 mediate homology - directed repair in HEK 293FT cells , whereas only the former does so in human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ; Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 3a – c ) . We further confirmed using SURVEYOR assay that no target indel mutations are induced by the SpCas9 D10A nickase ( Supplementary Fig . 3d ) . To explore whether the genome targeting ability of sgRNA ( + 85 ) is influenced by epigenetic factors 15 , 16 that constrain the alternative transcription activator - like effector nuclease ( TALENs ) 17 – 21 and potentially also zinc finger nuclease ( ZFNs ) 22 – 26 technologies , we further tested the ability of SpCas9 to cleave methylated DNA . Using either unmethylated or M . Sss I - methylated pUC19 as DNA targets ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) in a cell - free cleavage assay , we showed that SpCas9 efficiently cleaves pUC19 regardless of CpG methylation status in either the 20 - bp target sequence or the PAM ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . To test whether this is also true in vivo , we designed sgRNAs to target a highly methylated region of the human SERPINB5 locus ( Fig . 1e , f ) . All three sgRNAs tested were able to mediate indel mutations in endogenously methylated targets ( Fig . 1g ) . Having established the optimal guide RNA architecture for SpCas9 and having demonstrated its insensitivity to genomic CpG methylation , we sought to conduct a comprehensive characterization of the DNA targeting specificity of SpCas9 . Previous studies on SpCas9 cleavage specificity 1 , 2 , 12 were limited to a small set of single - nucleotide mismatches between the guide sequence and DNA target , suggesting that perfect base - pairing within 10 – 12 bp directly 5 ′ of the PAM ( PAM - proximal ) determines Cas9 specificity , whereas multiple PAM - distal mismatches can be tolerated . In addition , a recent study using catalytically inactive SpCas9 as a transcriptional repressor found no significant off - target effects throughout the Escherichia coli transcriptome 27 . However , a systematic analysis of Cas9 specificity within the context of a larger mammalian genome has not yet been reported . To address this , we first evaluated the effect of imperfect complementarity between the guide RNA and its genomic target on SpCas9 activity , and then assessed the cleavage activity resulting from a single sgRNA on multiple genomic off - target loci with sequence similarity . To facilitate large - scale testing of mismatched guide sequences , we developed a simple sgRNA testing assay by generating expression cassettes encoding U6 - driven sgRNAs using PCR and transfecting the resulting amplicons ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . We then performed deep sequencing of the region flanking each target site ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) for two independent biological replicates . From these data , we applied a binomial model to detect true indel events resulting from SpCas9 cleavage and NHEJ misrepair and calculated Hsu et al . Page 3 Nat Biotechnol .

We systematically investigated the effect of base - pairing mismatches between guide RNA sequences and target DNA on target modification efficiency . We chose four target sites within the human EMX1 gene ( 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 ) and , for each , generated a set of 57 different guide RNAs containing all possible single - nucleotide substitutions in positions 1 – 19 directly 5 ′ of the requisite NGG PAM ( Fig . 2a ) . The 5 ′ guanine at position 20 is preserved , given that the U6 promoter requires guanine as the first base of its transcript . These ‘off - target’ guide RNAs were then assessed for cleavage activity at the on - target genomic locus . Consistent with previous findings 1 , 2 , 12 , SpCas9 tolerates single - base mismatches in the PAM - distal region to a greater extent than in the PAM - proximal region . In contrast to a model that implies that a prototypical 10 – 12 bp PAM - proximal seed sequence largely determines target specificity 1 , 2 , 12 , we found that most bases within the 20 - bp target site provide varying degrees of specificity . Single - base specificity generally ranges from 8 to 14 bp immediately upstream of the PAM , indicating a sequence - dependent , mismatch - sensitive boundary that varies in length ( Fig . 2b , Supplementary Fig . 7 and Supplementary Table 5 ) . To further investigate the contributions of base identity and position within the guide RNA to SpCas9 specificity , we generated additional sets of mismatched guide RNAs for 11 more target sites within the EMX1 locus ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , totaling over 400 sgRNAs . These guide RNAs were designed to cover all 12 possible RNA : DNA mismatches for each position in the guide sequence with at least 2× coverage for positions 1 – 10 . Our aggregate single - mismatch data reveal multiple exceptions to the seed sequence model of SpCas9 specificity 1 , 2 , 6 ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Table 5 ) . Within the PAM - proximal region , the degree of tolerance varied with the identity of a particular mismatch , with rC : dC base - pairing exhibiting the highest level of disruption to SpCas9 cleavage activity ( Fig . 2c ) . In addition to the target specificity , we also investigated the NGG PAM requirement of SpCas9 . To vary the second and third positions of PAM , we selected 32 target sites within the EMX1 locus encompassing all 16 possible alternate PAMs with 2× coverage ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Using the SURVEYOR assay , we showed that SpCas9 also cleaves targets with NAG PAMs , albeit with one - fifth of the efficiency for target sites with 5 ′ - NGG PAMs ( Fig . 2d ) . The tolerance for an NAG PAM is in agreement with previous bacterial studies 2 and expands the S . pyogenes Cas9 target space to every 4 bp on average within the human genome , not accounting for constraining factors such as guide RNA secondary structure or certain epigenetic modifications ( Fig . 2e ) . Although we have shown here that methylated DNA sequences can be cleaved , by SpCas9 further characterization of the implications of epigenetic factors on CRISPR editing efficiency are needed . We next explored the effect of multiple base mismatches on SpCas9 target activity . For four targets within the EMX1 gene , we designed sets of guide RNAs that contained varying combinations of mismatches to investigate the effect of mismatch number , position and spacing on SpCas9 target cleavage activity ( Fig . 3a , b , and Supplementary Table 6 ) . In general , we observed that the total number of mismatched base - pairs is a key determinant Hsu et al . Page 4 Nat Biotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t for SpCas9 cleavage efficiency . Two mismatches , particularly those occurring in a PAM - proximal region , considerably reduced SpCas9 activity whether these mismatches are concatenated or interspaced ( Fig . 3a , b ) ; this effect is further magnified for three concatenated mismatches ( Fig . 3a ) . Furthermore , three or more interspaced ( Fig . 3c ) and five concatenated ( Fig . 3a ) mismatches eliminated detectable SpCas9 cleavage in the vast majority of loci . The position of mismatches within the guide sequence also affected the activity of SpCas9 . PAM - proximal mismatches are less tolerated than PAM - distal counterparts ( Fig . 3a ) , recapitulating our observations from the single base - pair mismatch data ( Fig . 2c ) . This effect is particularly salient in guide sequences bearing a small number of total mismatches , whether those are consecutive ( Fig . 3a ) or interspaced ( Fig . 3b ) . Additionally , guide sequences with mismatches spaced four or more bases apart also mediated SpCas9 cleavage in some cases ( Fig . 3c ) . Thus , together with the identity of mismatched base - pairing , we observed that many off - target cleavage effects can be explained by a combination of mismatch number and position . Given these mismatched guide RNA results , we expected that for any particular sgRNA , SpCas9 may cleave genomic loci that contain small numbers of mismatched bases . For the four EMX1 targets described above , we computationally selected 117 candidate off - target sites in the human genome that are followed by a 5 ′ - NRG PAM and meet any of the following additional criteria : ( i ) up to five mismatches , ( ii ) short insertions or deletions or ( iii ) mismatches only in the PAM - distal region . Additionally , we assessed off - target loci of high sequence similarity without the PAM requirement . The majority of off - target sites tested for each sgRNA ( 30 / 31 , 23 / 23 , 48 / 51 and 12 / 12 sites for EMX1 targets 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 , respectively ) exhibited modification efficiencies at least 2 magnitudes lower than that of corresponding on - targets ( Fig . 4a , b , Supplementary Fig . 9 and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 ) . Of the four off - target sites that exhibit substantial modification efficiencies , three contained only mismatches in the PAM - distal region , consistent with our multiple mismatch sgRNA observations ( Fig . 3 ) . Notably , these three loci were followed by 5 ′ - NAG PAMs , demonstrating that off - target analyses of SpCas9 must include 5 ′ - NAG as well as 5 ′ - NGG candidate loci . Enzymatic specificity and activity strength are often highly dependent on reaction conditions , which at high enzyme concentration might amplify off - target activity 28 , 29 . One potential strategy for minimizing nonspecific cleavage is to limit the enzyme concentration , namely the level of SpCas9 - sgRNA complex . Cleavage specificity , measured as the ratio of on - to off - target cleavage , increased dramatically as we decreased the equimolar amounts of SpCas9 and sgRNA transfected into 293FT cells ( Fig . 4c , d ) from 7 . 1 × 10 −10 to 1 . 8 × 10 −11 nmol / cell ( 400 ng to 10 ng of Cas9 - sgRNA plasmid ) . qRT - PCR assay confirmed that the level of hSpCas9 mRNA and sgRNA decreased proportionally to the amount of transfected DNA ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Whereas specificity increased gradually by nearly fourfold as we decreased the transfected DNA amount from 7 . 1 × 10 −10 to 9 . 0 × 10 −11 nmol / cell ( 400 ng to 50 ng plasmid ) , we observed a notable additional sevenfold increase in specificity upon further decreasing transfected DNA from 9 . 0 × 10 −11 to 1 . 8 × 10 −11 nmol / cell ( 50 ng to 10 ng plasmid ; Fig . 4c ) . These findings suggest that we can minimize the level of off - Hsu et al . Page 5 Nat Biotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 March 30 .

However , increasing specificity by reducing the amount of transfected DNA also leads to a reduction in on - target cleavage . These measurements enable quantitative integration of specificity and efficiency criteria into dosage choice to optimize SpCas9 activity for different applications . Additional work to explore modifications in SpCas9 and sgRNA design may improve SpCas9 - intrinsic specificity without sacrificing cleavage efficiency . The ability to program SpCas9 to target specific sites in the genome by simply designing a short guide RNA complementary to the desired target site holds enormous potential for applications throughout biology and medicine . Our results demonstrate that the specificity of SpCas9 - mediated DNA cleavage is sequence - and locus - dependent and governed by the quantity , position and identity of mismatching bases . Whereas the PAM - proximal 8 – 12 bp of the guide sequence generally defines specificity , the PAM - distal sequences also contribute to the overall specificity of SpCas9 - mediated DNA cleavage . Although there may be off - target cleavage for a given guide sequence , they can be predicted and likely minimized by following general design guidelines . To maximize SpCas9 specificity for editing a particular gene , one should identify potential ‘off - target’ genomic sequences by considering the following four constraints . First and foremost , they should not be followed by a PAM with either 5 ′ - NGG or 5 ′ - NAG sequences . Second , their global sequence similarity to the target sequence should be minimized , and guide sequences with genomic off - target loci that have fewer than three mismatches should be avoided . Third , at least two mismatches should lie within the PAM - proximal region of the off - target site . Fourth , a maximal number of mismatches should be consecutive or spaced less than four bases apart . Finally , the amount of SpCas9 and sgRNA can be titrated to optimize on - to off - target cleavage ratio . Using these criteria , we formulated a scoring algorithm to integrate and quantify the contributions of mismatch location , density and identity on SpCas9 on - target and off - target cleavage . We applied the aggregate cleavage efficiencies of single - mismatch guide RNAs to test this scoring scheme separately on genome - wide targets and found that these factors , taken together , accounted for > 50 % of the variance in cutting - frequency rank among the genome - wide targets studied ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . Implementing the guidelines delineated above , we designed a computational tool to facilitate the selection and validation of sgRNAs as well as to predict off - target loci for specificity analyses ; this tool can be accessed at http : / / www . genome - engineering . org / . These results and tools further extend the SpCas9 system as a versatile alternative to ZFNs and TALENs for genome editing applications . Further work examining the thermodynamics and in vivo stability of sgRNA - DNA duplexes will likely yield additional predictive power for off - target activity , whereas exploration of SpCas9 mutants and orthologs may yield novel variants with improved specificity .

Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) at 80 – 90 % confluency following the manufacturer ' s recommended protocol . For each well of a 6 - well plate , a total of 1 μg of Cas9 + sgRNA plasmid was used . For each well of a 24 - well plate , a total of 500 ng Cas9 + sgRNA plasmid was used unless otherwise indicated . For each well of a 96 - well plate , 65 ng of Cas9 plasmid was used at a 1 : 1 molar ratio to the U6 - sgRNA PCR product . Human embryonic stem cell line HUES9 ( Harvard Stem Cell Institute core ) was maintained in feeder - free conditions on GelTrex ( Life Technologies ) in mTesR medium ( Stemcell Technologies ) supplemented with 100 μg / ml Normocin ( InvivoGen ) . HUES9 cells were transfected with Amaxa P3 Primary Cell 4 - D Nucleofector Kit ( Lonza ) following the manufacturer ' s protocol . SURVEYOR nuclease assay for genome modification 293FT and HUES9 cells were transfected with DNA as described above . Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h post - transfection before genomic DNA extraction . Genomic DNA was extracted using the QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution ( Epicentre ) following the manufacturer ' s protocol . Briefly , pelleted cells were resuspended in QuickExtract solution and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min , 68 °C for 15 min , and 98 °C for 10 min . The genomic region flanking the CRISPR target site for each gene was PCR amplified ( target sites and primers listed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ) , and products were purified using QiaQuick Spin Column ( Qiagen ) following the manufacturer ' s protocol . 400 ng total of the purified PCR products were mixed with 2 μl 10× Taq DNA Polymerase PCR buffer ( Enzymatics ) and ultrapure water to a final volume of 20 μl , and subjected to a re - annealing process to enable heteroduplex formation : 95 °C for 10 min , 95 °C to 85 °C ramping at −2 °C / s , 85 °C to 25 °C at −0 . 25 °C / s , and 25 °C hold for 1 min .

Briefly , RNAs were extracted using the mirPremier microRNA Isolation Kit ( Sigma ) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min before loading on 8 % denaturing polyacrylamide gels ( SequaGel , National Diagnostics ) . Afterwards , RNA was transferred to a Hybond N + membrane ( GE Healthcare ) and crosslinked with Stratagene UV Crosslinker ( Stratagene ) . Probes were labeled with ( gamma - 32 P ) ATP ( PerkinElmer ) with T4 polynucleotide kinase ( New England Biolabs ) . After washing , membrane was exposed to phosphor screen for 1 h and scanned with phosphorimager ( Typhoon ) . Bisulfite sequencing to assess DNA methylation status Genomic DNA from 293FT cells was isolated with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit ( Qiagen ) and bisulfite converted with EZ DNA Methylation - Lightning Kit ( Zymo Research ) . Bisulfite PCR was conducted using KAPA2G Robust HotStart DNA Polymerase ( KAPA Biosystems ) with primers designed using the Bisulfite Primer Seeker ( Zymo Research , Supplementary Table 2 ) . Resulting PCR amplicons were gel - purified , digested with EcoRI and HindIII , and ligated into a pUC19 backbone before transformation . Individual clones were then Sanger sequenced to assess DNA methylation status . In vitro transcription and cleavage assay Whole cell lysates from 293FT cells were prepared with lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Roche ) . T7 - driven sgRNA was transcribed in vitro using custom oligos ( Supplementary Sequences ) and HiScribe T7 In vitro Transcription Kit ( NEB ) , following the manufacturer ' s recommended protocol . To prepare methylated target sites , pUC19 plasmid was methylated by M . Sss I and tested by digestion with HpaII . Unmethylated and successfully methylated pUC19 plasmids were linearized by NheI . The in vitro cleavage assay was carried out as follows : for a 20 μl cleavage reaction , 10 μl of cell lysate was incubated with 2 μl cleavage buffer ( 100 mM HEPES , 500 mM KCl , 25 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT , 25 % glycerol ) , 1 μg in vitro transcribed RNA and 300 ng pUC19 plasmid DNA .

Sequencing data analysis and indel detection MiSeq reads were filtered by requiring an average Phred quality ( Q score ) of at least 23 , as well as perfect sequence matches to barcodes and amplicon forward primers . Reads from on - and off - target loci were analyzed by first performing Smith - Waterman alignments against amplicon sequences that included 50 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the target site ( a total of 120 bp ) . Alignments , meanwhile , were analyzed for indels from 5 nucleotides upstream to 5 nucleotides downstream of the target site ( a total of 30 bp ) . Analyzed target regions were discarded if part of their alignment fell outside the MiSeq read itself , or if matched base - pairs comprised less than 85 % of their total length . Negative controls for each sample provided a gauge for the inclusion or exclusion of indels as putative cutting events . For each sample , an indel was counted only if its quality score exceeded μ - σ , where μ was the mean quality - score of the negative control corresponding to that sample and σ was the s . d . of the same . This yielded whole target - region indel rates for both negative controls and their corresponding samples . Using the negative control ' s per - target - region - per - read error rate , q , the sample ' s observed indel count n , and its read - count R , a maximum - likelihood estimate for the fraction of reads having target - regions with true - indels , p , was derived by applying a binomial error model , as follows . Letting the ( unknown ) number of reads in a sample having target regions incorrectly counted as having at least 1 indel be E , we can write ( without making any assumptions about the number of true indels ) as R ( 1 − p ) is the number of reads having target - regions with no true indels . Meanwhile , because the number of reads observed to have indels is n , n = E + Rp , that is , the number of reads having target - regions with errors but no true indels plus the number of reads whose target - regions correctly have indels . We can then rewrite the above Taking all values of the frequency of target - regions with true - indels p to be equally probable a priori , Prob ( n | p ) ∞ Prob ( p | n ) . The maximum - likelihood estimate ( MLE ) for the frequency of target regions with true indels was therefore set as the value of p that maximized Prob ( n | p ) . This was evaluated numerically .
