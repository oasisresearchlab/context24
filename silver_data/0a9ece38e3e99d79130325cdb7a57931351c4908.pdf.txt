(cid:129) RIAM regulates the activation of lymphocyte function - associated antigen 1 and very late antigen 4 on lymphocytes , but not a IIb b 3 on platelets . Regulation of integrinsis critical for lymphocyte adhesionto endothelium and trafficking through secondary lymphoid organs . Inside - out signaling to integrins is mediated by the small GTPase Rap1 . Two effectors of Rap1 regulate integrins , RapL and Rap1 interacting adaptormolecule ( RIAM ) . UsingmiceconditionallydeficientinbothRap1aandRap1band mice null for RIAM , we show that the Rap1 / RIAM module is not required for T - or B - cell development but is essential for efficient adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) 1 and for proper trafficking of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs . Interestingly , in RIAM - deficient mice , whereas peripheral lymph nodes ( pLNs ) were depleted of both B and T cells and recirculating B cells werediminished in thebonebarrow ( BM ) , thespleenwashypercellular , albeit witharelative deficiency of marginal zone B cells . The abnormality in lymphocyte trafficking was accom - panied by defective humoral immunity to T - cell – dependent antigens . Platelet function was intact in RIAM - deficient animals . These in vivo results confirm a role for RIAM in the regulationofsome , butnotall , leukocyteintegrinsandsuggestthatRIAM - regulatedintegrin activation is required for trafficking of lymphocytes from blood into pLNs and BM , where relatively high shear forces exist in high endothelial venules and sinusoids , respectively . ( Blood . 2015 ; 126 ( 25 ) : 2695 - 2703 ) Introduction Regulated adhesion of lymphocytes to vascular endothelium , antigen - presenting cells , and target cells is critical for adaptive immunity . 1 Among the molecules that mediate cell – cell adhesion of lympho - cytes are integrins , including lymphocyte function - associated anti - gen 1 ( LFA - 1 or a L b 2 ) and very late antigen 4 ( VLA - 4 or a 4 b 1 ) . Integrins are cellsurface receptors composed of ab heterodimers of type I transmembrane proteins in which the extracellular domains comprise adhesion modules that interact with extracellular matrix or cognate ligands on cells . LFA - 1 binds to a family of intercellular adhesion molecules ( ICAM - 1 , ICAM - 2 , ICAM - 3 ) , and VLA - 4 binds to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) . 1 Similar to allintegrins , the adhesivestate of LFA - 1 and VLA - 4 is regulated by a process known as inside - out signaling , whereby activation events in the cell are transmitted retrograde through the receptor to mod - ulate the conformation of the ectodomain , and thereby the af ﬁ nity for its cognate ligand . 2 The molecular mechanisms of inside - out signaling through LFA - 1 have been intensely studied . Among the proteins that reg - ulate inside - out signaling is the small GTPase Rap1 . 3 Rap1 be - comes activated by one of several guanine nucleotide exchange factors , including C3G , downstream of lymphocyte activation through the antigen receptor or through chemokine receptors . Guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) - bound , active Rap1 binds to sev - eral effectors . Two Rap1 effectors have been implicated in inside - out signaling to integrins , RapL 4 and Rap1 interacting adaptor molecule ( RIAM ) . 5 The N - terminus of RIAM binds talin1 , a cytoskeletal protein known to interact with integrins and regulate their adhesive state . 2 , 6 A domain of RIAM that is both a pleckstrin homology and Ras binding domain targets the molecule to the inner lea ﬂ et of the plasma membrane of activated lymphocytes by functioning as a proximity detector for GTP - bound Rap1 and phosphoinositol 4 , 5 bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] . 7 Once brought to the plasma membrane , RIAM links active Rap1 to integrins via talin1 . 8 Whereas the immunological phenotype of LFA - 1 de ﬁ ciency in mice has been extensively characterized by both neutralizing anti - bodies 9 and genetically engineered mice , 10 - 12 the consequences of in vivo disruption of the Rap1 / RIAM module has not been explored . Here we report that the Rap1 / RIAM module is not required for T - or B - cell development or platelet function but is essential for ef ﬁ cient adhesion to ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 and for proper traf ﬁ cking of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs .

Results Rap1 deficiency in T cells impairs adhesion , but not development Two genes encode 2 isoforms of Rap1 , RAP1A and RAP1B . Each isoform is ubiquitously expressed , and the functions of the 2 small GTPases appear to be redundant because mice lacking either are viable , 15 , 16 whereas a double knockout is embryonic lethal . 16 To study the effects of complete Rap1 de ﬁ ciency in T lymphocytes , we crossed mice with conditional ( ﬂ oxed ) alleles at both the RAP1A and RAP1B loci , 13 with animals transgenic for Cre recombinase ex - pressed from the Lck promoter that is activated very early in T - cell development . No Rap1 protein was detected in T cells from Rap1a ﬂ / ﬂ ; Rap1b ﬂ / ﬂ ; Lck - Cre mice ( Figure 1A ) , yet T - cell development was normal ( Figure 1B ) , indicating that Rap1 is not required for T - cell differentiation . Adhesion to ICAM - 1 stimulated by engagement of the T - cell receptor or phorbol myristate acetate was markedly re - duced in Rap1 - de ﬁ cient cells with haploinsuf ﬁ cient cells showing anintermediateresponse ( Figure 1C ) , suggesting thelevelsofRap1 are limiting in inside - out signaling in T cells . Basal adhesion was also reduced in Rap1 - de ﬁ cient T cells . Because T - cell traf ﬁ cking through secondary lymphoid organs requires adhesion to endothelium , westudiedtheeffectofRap1de ﬁ ciencyonT - cellpopulations . Whereas Rap1 de ﬁ ciency did not affect the number of T cells in the spleen or thymus , there was a marked decrease in T cells in peripheral lymph nodes ( pLNs ) and an increase in T cells inthe blood ( Figure 1D ) . Thus , Rap1 is required for normal T - cell traf ﬁ cking . RIAM - deficient mice are viable and fertile Tocon ﬁ rmtheroleofRIAMasaneffectorofRap1inlymphocytes , we soughttodeterminewhetherRIAMde ﬁ ciencywouldgiveaphenotype in vivo similar to Rap1 de ﬁ ciency . We therefore generated RIAM - de ﬁ cient mice using standard methods of gene targeting in ES cells by homologous recombination ( Figure 2A ) . In heterozygous crosses , RIAM null mice were born in Mendelian ratios , manifest no overt phenotype , andwerefertile . Thisresultsuggeststhatothergeneproducts cancompensateforRIAMde ﬁ ciency . Indeed , RIAMisamemberofthe MRL family of adaptor proteins that includes lamellipodin . 17 Both B and T cells from RIAM 2 / 2 animals contained no immunodetect - able RIAM ( Figure 2B ) . Interestingly , neither splenocytes nor platelets from wild - type mice expressed lamellipodin , and lamellipodin expres - sionwasnotinducedinthespleenorplateletsofRIAM - de ﬁ cientanimals ( Figure 2C ) . RIAM deficiency does not impair development of B and T lymphocytes The percentage of double - negative , double - positive , CD4 1 and CD8 1 thymocytes was not affected by RIAM de ﬁ ciency ( Figure 3A - B ) , con ﬁ rming that , as in Rap1 de ﬁ ciency , T - cell development was not affected . AlthoughthetotalnumberofBcellsinthebonemarrow ( BM ) ofRIAM 2 / 2 micewasreducedby ; 50 % ( Figure3C - D ) , theimmature B - cell and pre - pro B - cell populations were unaffected , suggesting that B - cell development in BM , similar to that of T cells in thymus , is not altered . The marked reduction in recirculating B cells in BM ( Figure 3D ) suggests the B - cell de ﬁ ciency in this compartment is a result of traf ﬁ cking , rather than lymphopoiesis . This is consistent with observations made in talin1 null mice , which are de ﬁ cient in integrin activation in lymphocytes , 18 and supports that idea that , similar to egress of lymphocytes through high endothelial venules in pLNs , reentry into BM requires integrin - mediated , shear - resistant adhesion to the endothelium of the BM sinusoids . 19 In contrastto BM , the number ofB cells in thespleens of RIAM 2 / 2 mice was markedly increased ( Figure 3E - F ) . Interestingly , the increase could be accounted for entirely by the follicular ( FO ) B cells , as the marginal zone ( MZ ) B cells were diminished by more than 50 % ( Figure 3E - F ) . This phenotype is similar to that of talin1 - de ﬁ cient animals . 18 Because much more Rap1b than Rap1a is expressed in Figure 2 . Generation of RIAM 2 / 2 mice . ( A ) Schematic representation of RIAM targeting . The RIAM locus of murine ES cells was targeted by homologous re - combination to generate an allele with loxP sites flanking exons 3 and 4 . The resulting RIAM conditional mice were crossed with a Cre - deleter strain to remove exons 3 and 4 , along with the Neo cassette , and thereby generate RIAM 1 / 2 mice that were crossed to produce RIAM 2 / 2 mice .

Immature B cells from BM enter the white pulp of the spleen through the MZ , where they mature into transitional B cells before differentiationintoMZcellsthatareretainedinthiscompartmentorFO B cells that pass into the follicles of the white pulp . 21 Three subsets of transitional B cells have been de ﬁ ned on the basis of surface markers : T1 , T2 , and T3 . 22 RIAM - de ﬁ cient mice had twice the number of T2 cells in their spleens relative to wild - type animals ( Figure 3G - H ) , suggesting a derangement in splenic maturation that may account for the surplus ofFOcells at the expense of MZ B cells . Despitealterations in total numbers , all subsets of B cells are generated in RIAM 2 / 2 mice , demonstrating that , as is the case for T cells , B - cell maturation does not require RIAM .

The surface expression of neither LFA - 1 ( Figure 4A ) nor VLA - 4 ( Figure 4B ) was affected by RIAM de ﬁ ciency in T or B lymphocytes . Nevertheless , both basal and stimulated adhesion of lymphocytes to ICAM - 1 was diminished in cells derived from RIAM 2 / 2 mice ( Figure 4C ) . Thissuggeststhatactivation of LFA - 1 in both B and T cells requires RIAM . Chemokine - stimulated adhesion of B cells was affected to a greater degree than that stimulated by cross - linking of the B - cell antigen receptor . Whereas T - cell - receptor - stimulated T - cell adhesion to VCAM - 1 was diminished in RIAM - de ﬁ cient cells , B - cell antigen receptor - stimulatedadhesionof B cells to VCAM - 1 was unaffected ( Figure 4D ) , indicating that VLA - 4 may be differentially regulated in B vs T cells . To better mimic physiologic conditions of adhesion under shear force , we studied the adhesion of T cells in a ﬂ ow chamber in which T cells are applied to a monolayer of CHO cells that express ICAM - 1 . Under ﬂ ow , the adhesion defect of RIAM 2 / 2 Tcellswasmorepronounced ( Figure4E ) thanthatmeasured in a static system ( Figure 4C ) , consistent with a role for RIAM in the integrin - mediated adhesion required to resist shear forces . Chemotaxis of B cells up a gradient of SDF - 1 was also diminished in the absence of RIAM ( Figure 4F ) , suggesting that a migration defect accompanies diminishedadhesion . AsimilarphenotypewasreportedforBcellsfrom Rap1b 2 / 2 mice . 20 Interestingly , this defect was not observed in talin1 - de ﬁ cient B cells , 18 suggesting a role for RIAM in B - cell migration distinct from linking Rap1 to integrins via talin1 . RIAM deficiency impairs homing of B and T cells to pLNs and BM , but not spleen Given the defects in adhesion and migration of RIAM - de ﬁ cient lymphocytes , we next studied traf ﬁ cking to lymphoid organs . The pLNs of RIAM 2 / 2 mice were markedly smaller than those of wild - type mice ( Figure 5A ) . The number of lymphocytes in pLNs was diminished by 85 % , with both B - and T - cell compartments equally affected ( Figure 5B ) . Histological examination of pLNs revealed dramatically shrunken B - cell zones ( Figure 5C ) similar to those observed in talin1 - de ﬁ cient animals . 18 In contrast to pLNs , the spleens of RIAM 2 / 2 mice contained more B and T cells ( Figure 5D ) , and the architecture of the white pulp was not altered ( Figure 5E ) . More B and T lymphocytes remained in the circulation of RIAM 2 / 2 mice relativetowild - typeanimals ( Figure5F ) . Theseresultsareconsistent with lymphocyte traf ﬁ cking defects involving decreased entry into pLNs , but not spleen , with commensurate accumulation of B and T cells in the circulation . The entry of lymphocytes into pLNs through high endothelial venules requires cell arrest under conditions of high shear forces , a process that requires activation of integrins . 23 In contrast , lymphocytes enter the marginal zone of the white pulp of the spleen from the red pulp under conditions of low ﬂ ow and shear , and therefore do not require integrin activation . Thus , our observations of the derangement of lymphocyte traf ﬁ c in RIAM 2 / 2 mice are perfectly consistent with a critical role for RIAM in the regulation of lymphocyte integrins . To directly test the effects of RIAM de ﬁ ciency on lymphocyte hom - ing , we performed adoptive transfer of equal mixtures of ﬂ uorescently Figure 4 .

Theconverseratiowasobservedinthecellsthatremained in circulation , demonstrating that overall traf ﬁ cking from the blood to secondary lymphoid organs was diminished by RIAM de ﬁ ciency . RIAM deficiency impairs humoral immunity to T - cell - dependent antigens Defects in lymphocyte traf ﬁ cking can affect adaptive immunity . 24 To determine whether this is the case for RIAM 2 / 2 mice , we studied humoral responses to immunization . Whereas basal IgA , IgG1 , and IgG3 levels were similar in RIAM 1 / 1 and Raim 2 / 2 mice , IgM levels were signi ﬁ cantly decreased in RIAM - de ﬁ cient animals ( Figure 6A ) . IgM and IgG3 responses to immunization with TNP - Ficoll were similar for the 2 genotypes ( Figure 6B ) , indicating that T - cell - independentantibodyresponsesareintact . Incontrast , RIAMde ﬁ ciency resulted in blunted IgM and IgG3 responses to TNP - KLH ( Figure 6C ) , demonstrating that RIAM is required for ef ﬁ cient T - cell - dependent antibodyproduction . ImpairedT - cell - dependenthumoralimmunitywas also observed in talin1 - de ﬁ cient mice , 18 but not in Rap1b 2 / 2 animals . 20 Our result is consistent with the defect in traf ﬁ cking of lymphocytes to pLNs , as T - cell - dependent antibody responses require B - and T - cell interactions in these secondary lymphoid organs . 25 Normal function of RIAM - deficient platelets Because platelet function has been reported to be intact in an indepen - dentlyderivedRIAM - de ﬁ cientmousestrain , 26 andbecausetheplatelet integrin , a IIb b 3 , is regulated by Rap1 in a manner similar to LFA - 1 , 27 we studied platelet function in our RIAM - de ﬁ cient mice . We observed noprolongedbleedingtimeaftertailsnipsinRIAM 2 / 2 micerelativeto wild - type littermates , and platelets from mice with the 2 genotypes showed normal aggregation responses to Par4 - activating peptide ( Par4p ) and the collagen mimic convulxin ( Figure 7A ) . Using phycoerythrin - conjugated JON / A , an antibody that recognizes the activated conformation of a IIb b 3 , we detected no difference in the kinetics of JON / A binding to platelets from the 2 genotypes stimu - lated with Par4p or convulxin ( Figure 7B ) . Thus , whereas RIAM is required for maximal integrin - mediated adhesion of lymphocytes , it is not required for activation of the platelet integrin a IIb b 3 .

These data are consistent with those reported for LFA - 1 - de ﬁ cient mice 12 and support the idea that , whereas integrins are required for arrest of lymphocytes in high endothelial venules , a prerequisite for ex - travasation from the circulation into pLNs , they are not required for entry of lymphocytes into the white pulp of spleen , where shear - resistant adhesion is not required to transit the marginal sinus . 21 Our data also indicate that although T - cell development in the thymus depends on the interaction of thymocytes with thymic stromal cells , this interaction does not require Rap1 , and therefore may not require integrin activation . RIAM has been characterized biochemically and in cell - based studies as a Rap1 effector involved in inside - out signaling to integrins . 5 , 7 Silencing of RIAM inJurkat T cells diminished adhesion . 5 Theresultsreportedherearethe ﬁ rstinvivocon ﬁ rmationofthisactivity and the ﬁ rst analysis of RIAM in B lymphocytes . We show that both primary B and T cells require RIAM for integrin - mediated adhesion . We also show that RIAM is required for traf ﬁ cking of both B and TlymphocytesintopLNsandBM , butnotspleen , consistentwiththe differential requirements for integrin - mediated adhesion for egress of lymphocytes from the circulation into the various secondary lymphoid organs . Importantly , we also show that RIAM is required for a normal humoral response to a T - dependent antigen , suggesting that diminished ingress of B and T cells into pLNs and / or diminished contact of these cells with antigen - processing cells abrogates B - cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells . TheincreasednumberofsplenicBcellsinRIAM 2 / 2 micere ﬂ ected an increase in follicular cells within the white pulp . Paradoxically , the number of MZ B cells was signi ﬁ cantly decreased . This suggests that whereas integrins are required neither for B cells to pass from red to white pulp nor for maturation into follicular cells , they are required for the entrapment , maturation , and retention of these B cells in the MZ , whereICAM - 1andVCAM - 1havebeenshowntobeexpressed . 28 This observation is consistent with the ﬁ nding that LFA - 1 and VLA - 4 are required for retention of B cells in the MZ 28 and with diminished MZ B cells in talin1 18 and Rap1b null 20 mice . Recently , another , independentRIAM 2 / 2 mousewasreported , and the authors found no defect in platelet function in these animals . 26 Our results with independently generated RIAM 2 / 2 mice con ﬁ rm these ﬁ ndings . Given the dependence of platelets on integrins , the platelet dysfunction observed in Rap1b - de ﬁ cient mice , 15 the robust expression of RIAM in megakaryocytes and platelets , 27 and the observation that RIAM can recruit talin1 to a IIb b 3 integrins in platelets , 27 the conclusion that RIAM is dispensable for platelet function is quite surprising . Because talin1 is required for a IIb b 3 activation and platelet function , 29 , 30 and because the Rap1 / RIAM complex activates talin1 , 6 platelets must use a distinct mechanism of talin1 activation . Becausewefoundnolamellipodinexpressedinplatelets ( Figure2C ) , it is not clear what protein substitutes for RIAM in platelets . It is also mysterious why a distinct Rap1 - dependent regulatory pathway for integrin activation evolved for platelets . Figure 6 .

BecauseRIAM is an adapter molecule that interacts with and activates talin1 , 6 direct control of integrins can be explained on a biochemical basis because talin1 has been shown to also interact with the b subunit of integrins , andtherebypromotedissociationofthe a and b subunits , whichinturn leads to a conformational change of the ectodomains of these proteins . 2 However , another effector of Rap1 , RapL , has also been implicated in integrin activation , and RapL - de ﬁ cient mice have a phenotype re - markablysimilartothatreportedhereforRIAM 2 / 2 mice : impairmentof stimulated adhesion of lymphocytes , defective traf ﬁ cking to pLNs , and depleted MZ B cells in the spleen . 14 Because other than a Rap1 binding domain , RIAMandRapLsharenootherobviousfunctionaldomains , itis dif ﬁ culttoconceiveofhowtheseeffectorshaveredundantfunction . One feature shared by RIAM and RapL is the ability to bind to the SKAP - 55 / ADAPadaptermolecules 31 , 32 ; thus , itispossiblethatde ﬁ ciencyofeither RIAMorRapLdisrupttheSKAP - 55 / ADAPmodulesuf ﬁ cientlytoblock integrin activation , although how these lymphocyte adapter proteins might regulate integrins is unknown . Another possibility is that whereas RIAM may play a structural role in bringing talin1 to the plasma membrane , where it can interact with integrin b subunits , RapL may indirectly regulate signaling events critical for the maintenance of the interactions . Indeed , RapL is a splice variant of Rassf5 , a member of afamilyofeffectorsthataretumorsuppressors . 33 RapLhasbeenshown to interact with and regulate the kinase activity of Mst1 , a Ste20 family kinase that is the mammalian ortholog of the tumor suppressor Hpo . 34 The activation of RIAM through its translocation to the plasma membrane is exquisitely controlled by an AND gate constituted by simultaneous binding to GTP - bound Rap1 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . 7 The mechanism whereby RapL associates with the plasma membrane has not been elucidated . The requirement for both RIAM and RapL for ef ﬁ cient integrin - mediated lymphocyte adhesion and traf ﬁ cking represents a bifurcation downstream of Rap1 and may constitute yet another example of the ﬁ ne regulation of stimulated lymphocyte adhesion that is essential to adaptive immunity but must be held in check to avoid maladaptive autoimmunity . Regardless of the inter - play between the 2 Rap1 effectors relevant to integrin activation , our study reveals that the Rap1 / RIAM module is essential for ef ﬁ cient lymphocyte adhesion and traf ﬁ cking and for the humoral immune response that depends on these functions . The dispensability of RIAM for platelet function leads to the unexpected conclusion that thereareatleast2pathwaysbywhichRap1regulatesintegrins : onethat depends on RIAM and one that does not .
