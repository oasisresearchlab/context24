Virtual Reality design - build - test games with physics simulation : opportunities for researching design cognition Maria Adriana Neroni , Alfred Oti and Nathan Crilly Department of Engineering , University of Cambridge , Cambridge , UK ABSTRACT Increasing the range of methods available for researching design cogni - tion provides new opportunities for studying the phenomena of interest . Here we propose an approach for observing design activities , using Virtual Reality ( VR ) design - build - test games with built - in physics simulation . To illustrate this , we report on two exploratory design workshops where two groups of participants worked to solve a technical design problem using such a platform . Participants were asked to sketch ideas to solve the problem , and then to design , test and iterate some of their developed design concepts in a VR game . Researchers were able to obtain contin - uous and multifaceted recordings of participants’ behavior during the various design activities . This included on - screen design activities , verbal utterances , physical gestures , digital models of design outputs , and records of the test outcomes . Our experiences with the workshops are discussed with respect to the opportunities that similar VR game plat - forms offer for design cognition research , both in general and specifically in terms of ideation , prototyping , problem reframing , intrinsic motivation and demonstrated vulnerability . VR game platforms not only offer a valuable addition to existing research options , but additionally offer a basis for developing training interventions in design education and practice . ARTICLE HISTORY Received 9 September 2020 Accepted 10 May 2021 KEYWORDS Virtual reality ; prototyping ; design cognition ; workshop ; methodology 1 . Introduction ‘Design cognition’ is the term used to describe the mental processes and representations involved in designing , and is a significant area of historical and contemporary research ( Hay , Cash et al . , 2020 ) . Design cognition is of central importance to a number of design activities , including problem definition , solution generation and the formulation and application of design processes ( Cross , 2001 ) . Since the pioneering work on architects conducted by Eastman ( 1969 ) , a substantial and varied range of research methods has been adopted and adapted for studying design cognition and its related activities . These often include case studies , protocol studies , controlled experiments ( e . g . , see Cross , 2001 ; Gero & McNeill , 1998 ; Shah et al . , 2000 ) and a range of methods that exploit recent technological developments . Collectively , this combination of research methods has increased our knowledge of how designers think and act , resulting in theories of inspiration , fixation , representa - tion , co - evolution , prototyping , communication and many other processes ( e . g . , see Cross , 2001 ; Dorst & Cross , 2001 ; Gero & McNeill , 1998 ; Goldschmidt & Tatsa , 2005 ; Shah et al . , 2000 ; Wiltschnig et al . , 2013 ; Yilmaz & Seifert , 2011 ) .

The study of design cognition is closely connected to the media and modes of representation that designers work with , including spoken utterances , written documents , sketches , computer models and physical objects . One technology that has recently been incorporated into design practice and design research is the latest generation of virtual reality ( VR ) , specifically in the form of immersive and interactive head - mounted display technologies . The focus has primarily been on the technical advantages that VR offers for the development and validation of design solutions ( for examples of recent approaches , see Kent et al . , 2019 ; Oti & Crilly , 2021 ; Wolfartsberger , 2019 ) . However , the opportunities for applying this new technology to the study of design cognition have not been well explored . To address this , we propose the use of physics - based VR game platforms that support design , build and test activities . The use of such games promises researchers access to a design environment in which participants can rapidly construct a very wide range of design solutions and then test design performance with realistic physics simulations , all with minimal learning of the interface . It also promises researchers continuous and multifaceted data collection , including on - screen design activities , verbal utterances , physical gestures , digital models of design outputs and records of the test outcomes . Having access to such integrated data on design , build and test behaviors could allow researchers to directly observe how participants move between the various design activities ( or stages of design ) and characterize the variables that facilitate or interfere with such activities . VR platforms also promise researchers the opportunity to control an environment which ‘immerses’ participants in scenarios that represent many aspects of design practice , especially practices where physical making and testing are central to idea development . Finally , adopting a game - based approach may increase participant engagement , compliance and satisfaction ( for a review on the benefits of game - based research methods see Lankoski & Björk , 2015 ) . Individually or in combination , the various features of VR - based design research offer new opportunities to study design cognition , especially when complementing other research approaches . We investigated these opportunities through two exploratory design workshops invol - ving participants with different levels of design expertise . During the workshops , the participants were presented with a technical problem and asked to first sketch and discuss possible solutions , and then to use a VR environment to build , test and iterate a sub - set of those solutions . We analyzed the resulting data , not to report on specific aspects of design cognition , but to report on the methodological opportunities that the approach provided and the limitations we encountered . 2 . Literature review To explore the context for researching design cognition through VR game platforms , we first review literature related to three topics : ( 1 ) current approaches used when researching design cognition , ( 2 ) VR and gaming research , and ( 3 ) activities permitting build - and - test in design research . 2 . 1 . Researching design cognition Different research methods have been used for studying design cognition . These include controlled experiments , protocol analyses , case studies and a range of methods that exploit recent technolo - gical development . Each of these methods tends to emphasize and de - emphasize different aspects of the phenomena of interest . Controlled experiments typically focus on specific design activities ( e . g . , idea generation , concept refinement ) , with participants required to work on a set design task in a controlled ‘laboratory’ environment . Participants’ design behavior is often analyzed by recording and evaluating design outputs , for example , in the form of annotated sketches ( e . g . , see Perttula & Sipilä , 2007 ; Van Der Lugt , 2005 ; Viswanathan & Linsey , 2011 ) . Protocol studies typically involve recording ‘artificial’ design sessions where participants’ design behavior is captured and analyzed through the records of both verbal and visual data . This information can be recorded while the design activities are taking place ( concurrent protocols ) or after those activities have been 140 M . A . NERONI ET AL . completed ( retrospective protocols ) ( e . g . , see Dorst & Cross , 2001 ; Gero & McNeill , 1998 ) . Case studies typically involve more naturalistic observations of designers engaging with their design activities , often in commercial projects . In these studies , researchers record the progress and development of design activities , by some combination of direct observation , document analysis and participant interviews ( e . g . , see Crilly , 2019a ; Crilly & Moroşanu Firth , 2019 ; Cross , 2001 ; Jonson , 2005 ; Sosa , 2019 ; Yilmaz & Seifert , 2011 ) . In addition to these ‘traditional’ research methods , there are also a range of new or emerging research methods , many of which exploit developments in the technologies with which designers work . For example , researchers study how designers think by examining the digital ‘traces’ or ‘footprints’ that are left from electronic messaging , computer - aided design , analysis software and digital additive manufacturing technologies ( e . g . , Greenhalgh , 2016 ; Maaravi et al . , 2020 ; Zhang et al . , 2017 ) . The ‘big data’ surrounding patents also permits meta - analyses of design outcomes and artifacts across several studies in order to identify performance patterns of designers ( e . g . , Alstott et al . , 2017 ) or to predict how particular features of the design can impact an invention’s future realization and success ( e . g . , He & Luo , 2017 ) . Beyond the technologies that enable or represent design work , there is also the increasing availability of tools for measuring designers’ physiological and neurophysiological states and processes , which also provide new ways to measure design cognition ( Gero & Milovanovic , 2020 ; Hay et al . , 2019 ) . These technological developments , and others such as artificial intelligence ( see Gero , 2020 ; Goldschmidt , 2019 ) , have permitted new forms of data to be collected , and for that new data to be compared and combined with data resulting from more traditional methods and media . Overall , the application of many different research methods has shaped our understanding of design cognition . However , the knowledge that they provide is highly dependent on the types and variety of data that they enable collection of , and the forms of analysis associated with these ( Greene et al . , 1989 ; Mingers , 1997 ; Norgaard , 1989 ) . For instance , controlled experiments are good for isolating variables and assessing the effect of those variables on design behavior . However , by focussing on specific design activities , they often provide only a snap - shot of the design process . In addition , because it is typically only the design outputs that are analyzed , the mechanisms underpinning design behavior must be inferred from those outputs rather than from any more direct observation . Protocol analysis and case studies allow for studying design cognition throughout the process of designing and in contexts that more closely resemble naturally occurring settings . However , these methods also have some drawbacks . For instance , protocol studies may disrupt task performance ( Luque & O’Hora , 2002 ) and rely heavily on the information provided in external representations , both verbally and in drawings and other media ( e . g . , see Cross , 2001 ; Lloyd et al . , 1996 ) . In case studies , the data that can be collected are often limited to the extant records of the various design activities ( e . g . , see Busby & Lloyd , 1999 ; Herring et al . , 2009 ) and by the researchers’ access to such records ( e . g . , see Shroyer et al . , 2018 ; Wiltschnig et al . , 2013 ) . There are many methodological comparisons illustrating the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and their most common applications ( e . g . , for general discussions see Robson , 2002 ; for design - specific discussions see Blessing & Chakrabarti , 2009 ) . However , detailed critical comparisons are difficult because of substantial variation in how individual methods are applied and how they are tailored to specific research questions . For illustrations of this , see discussions about the validity of protocol studies in design and problem solving ( e . g . , Blech et al . , 2019 ; Chiu & Shu , 2010 ) ; experiments in design and engineering ( e . g . , Cash et al . , 2016 ; Panchal & Szajnfarber , 2017 ) and case studies in design and cognition ( e . g . , Crilly , 2019a ; Wallace & Gruber , 1989 ) . However , whatever strengths and weaknesses are identified with existing methods , the development of alternative approaches should not be seen as an attack : methodological diversity is beneficial for exploring different aspects of the phenomena of interest and providing cross - method checks ( for such arguments applied to design research see Crilly , 2019b ; for wider argu - ments see Greene et al . , 1989 ; Mingers , 1997 ; van Peer et al . , 2012 ) . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 141 Perceptions that a restricted range of methodological options are exploited in design research have led several design researchers to call for new approaches for studying design behavior ( for a discussion see Boujut & Blanco , 2003 ; Crilly & Cardoso , 2017 ; Editorial board of IJDCI , 2013 ; Goldschmidt & Tatsa , 2005 ) . To answer this call , we propose that Virtual Reality ( VR ) gaming platforms offer a valuable opportunity for combining the benefits of experimental approaches ( isolation and control of the variables of interest ) with the benefits of protocol analysis , case studies or and some of the newly emerging approaches ( observation of longitudinal design behavior and use of scenarios that more closely resemble real - world design activities ) . Whilst some trade - offs would inevitably be involved in implementing a VR - based approach , other related research fields are already applying such approaches and deriving methodological benefits from that ( e . g . , see Bateman et al . , 2009 ; Bohil et al . , 2011 ; Choi & Chan , 2004 ; Jayaram et al . , 1997 ) . 2 . 2 . VR and gaming research Virtual reality is generally understood as a computer - based technology that allows users to interact with a multisensory simulated environment and receive ‘real - time’ feedback on performance ( e . g . , see Muhanna , 2015 ; Sheridan , 2000 ; Silva & Moioli , 2017 ; Tennent et al . , 2017 ) . Although there are various VR technologies , we focus here on the latest generation of commercially available head - mounted displays and hand - held controllers for interactive and immersive room - scale experiences . The headsets provide stereoscopic images which reflect head movements , creating the illusion of space and depth . Users often also hear sounds in stereo which are synchronized with the images , thus enhancing realism . Users manipulate hand - held controllers ( or other peripherals , such as gloves fitted with sensors ) to interact with seemingly three - dimensional stimuli ( De França et al . , 2013 ) . Unlike traditional ‘flat’ user interfaces , in VR environments the operator is completely ‘immersed’ in the virtual displays and thus experiences a sense of ‘presence’ in the virtual environ - ment . Although terms such as immersion and presence are often used interchangeably or incon - sistently , we here adopt Slater’s ( 1999 ) objective - subjective distinction . Immersion is an objective property of a virtual system , referring to the degree to which the system provides a surrounding environment , shutting out sensations from the real world . Presence is a subjective aspect of the operators’ experience , referring to their feeling of being situated in the virtual environment rather than in the real world . Immersion influences presence ( Bowman & McMahan , 2007 ) as well as a wide range of cognitive states , processes and experiences , including engagement and motivation ( W . Huang et al . , 2020 ) , embodiment ( Kilteni et al . , 2012 ) and flow ( Pallavicini & Pepe , 2019 ) . These , in turn , are known to influence creativity , problem - solving and design work ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1996 ; Faas et al . , 2014 ; Obeid & Demirkan , 2020 ; Wilson , 2002 ) . For example , because immersion and the sense of presence are known to influence engagement and motivation , VR has often been used to promote learning ( Dede , 2009 ; De Jong , 2010 ) and has been applied in education generally ( Tang et al . , 2012 ; Virvou & Katsionis , 2008 ) and engineering education specifically ( Muller et al . , 2017 ) . A recent meta - review indicates the widespread adoption and implementation of VR in learning across many disciplines and the promising outcomes that have resulted ( Radianti et al . , 2020 ; also see Merchant et al . , 2014 ) . In developing a VR system , it is typically the level of immersion that can be directly manipulated , along with other aspects of the user’s interaction . For example , presence is reported to vary directly with display and interaction fidelity , and also with the correspondence between the interaction options that are expected and those that are encountered ( Gilbert , 2016 ; McMahan et al . , 2012 ) . However , success in creating an immersive VR environment isn’t determined by whether the virtual world is as real as the physical world , but whether the virtual world is real enough for viewers to suspend their disbelief and to experience ‘being there’ for a period of time ( Bowman & McMahan , 2007 ; Chan , 1997 ) . 142 M . A . NERONI ET AL . The characteristics of VR and the responses that it elicits from users are especially valuable in research because participants can be realistically immersed in simulated environments , feeling themselves to be wholly present in those environments . In the past two decades , VR technologies have been successfully applied in research fields that heavily rely on visualization , communication and interaction ( for education examples see Bailenson et al . , 2008 ; Wagner et al . , 2013 ; for military examples see Psotka , 1995 ; for medical examples see Johnsen et al . , 2005 ) . In design , researchers have highlighted some of the benefits that may arise from the use of VR in design education and practice . For instance , Dobson ( 1998 ) explored the potential of VR as a tool for conceptual design in a teaching programme involving architectural students . He found that the use of VR assisted students in visualizing and analyzing numerous design ideas and facilitated the decision - making process ( also see Bewick & Riedel , 1994 ) . Chan ( 1997 ) also suggested that VR can be used as an instrument to increase design creativity because the interactivity of the tool allows designers to visualize and test design solutions within these virtual environments . In particular , he argued that the design data generated and saved through a VR platform may offer advantages for three different groups : ( 1 ) the students , who may visualize and understand their design processes three - dimensionally , promoting a broader range of sources from which to develop creative work ; ( 2 ) the educators , who may have different opportunities for observing the students’ design process and use this information for improving pedagogies ; and ( 3 ) the researchers , who may have more data to study the designers’ process of creation . Different VR environments and tools have been adapted and used for research purposes , including VR games ( Lewis & Rosie , 2012 ; Straker et al . , 2011 ) . Though traditionally associated with leisure and entertainment , games have now been extensively used to understand , measure and improve human behavior ( e . g . , see Bideau et al . , 2003 ; Kozlov & Johansen , 2010 ; Rosenberg et al . , 2013 ; Zyda , 2005 ) . This includes attempts to use computer - based games to enhance or accelerate learning ( Hamari et al . , 2016 ; Qian & Clark , 2016 ) , including engineering ( Deshpande & Huang , 2011 ) and design ( Kosmadoudi et al . , 2013 ) . If we move from traditional computer games to VR - based games then the additional benefits include use of more realistic , immersive and interactive scenarios , higher levels of adaptability ( to different contexts , research objectives and learning styles ) , and higher levels of investment , engagement and motivation ( Lankoski & Björk , 2015 ) . VR games thus offer the opportunity to achieve high levels of ecological validity while ensuring high levels of control over the variables of interest – a rare combination in research ( McMahan et al . , 2012 , 2011 ) . These benefits have led to the adoption of VR games in diverse fields , including education ( Virvou & Katsionis , 2008 ) , combat ( Zyda , 2005 ) and medicine ( Lewis & Rosie , 2012 ) . However , design researchers have done little to integrate VR games in their studies ( but see French et al . , 2014 for a related analysis of a non - VR multi - player collaborative 3D design game ) . 2 . 3 . Build - and - test in design research Build - and - test activities are widely implemented in design processes using a variety of media , including physical models , digital prototypes and virtual prototypes ( we distinguish here between digital and virtual prototyping even though these terms are often used interchangeably , see Wang , 2002 ) . Physical models range from very simple nonfunctional models which are used for the visualization of design concepts ( augmenting sketches and gestures ) to highly complicated and fully functional prototypes which help designers to identify and rectify problems with their designs before making further commitments ( Viswanathan & Linsey , 2011 ) . Design research into physical models has mainly investigated the effects of these models as design tools with the aim of giving recommendations of when and how they should be used while designing . For instance , physical models help designers to visualize their concepts and enhance communication ( e . g . , Boujut & Blanco , 2003 ; Lidwell et al . , 2010 ) ; they also allow designers to visualize the flaws in their designs before production ( e . g . , see Bucciarelli , 1994 ; Ward et al . , 1995 ) . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 143 The use of physical models has been shown to increase the quality and originality of design solutions ( Viswanathan & Linsey , 2010 ; 2011 ; Youmans , 2011 ) . Nevertheless , warnings have been expressed about the costs associated with the development of physical models , particularly at early stages of the design process ( Buur & Andreasen , 1989 ; Viswanathan & Linsey , 2011 ) . The time and other resources invested in building physical models may lead designers to prematurely commit to early design solutions , promoting the occurrence of mental blocks such as design fixation ( Kershaw et al . , 2011 ; Moreno et al . , 2014 ; Viswanathan & Linsey , 2011 ; Youmans , 2011 ) . This has led to suggestions that low - effort model building processes should be promoted during the design process ( e . g . , see Viswanathan & Linsey , 2011 ) . In relation to this , techniques such as 3D printing can , in some circumstances , reduce the costs and the time associated with prototyping activities ( Vinodh et al . , 2009 ) . However , a range of studies have shown that designing with 3D printing can restrict the creative development of ideas ( Greenhalgh , 2016 ; Prabhu et al . , 2018 ; Rias et al . , 2016 ) , although this can be moderated through effective training ( Prabhu et al . , 2020 ) . Digital prototyping involves the use of computer - aided design ( CAD ) , computer - automated design ( CAutoD ) and computer - aided engineering ( CAE ) software to create , modify and analyze digital models . Some of the benefits that digital prototyping tools have over physical model making include increased productivity , increased design quality and simulation possibilities ( e . g . , see Colln et al . , 2012 ; Islamoglu & Deger , 2015 ; Negendahl , 2015 ) . Design research has mainly analyzed the impact of digital prototypes on design processes and design outcomes . For example , the use of CAD models was found to facilitate visualization of design concepts and designers’ reflection ( e . g . , see Schon & Wiggins , 1992 ; Suwa & Tversky , 1997 ) . However , CAD tools are also associated with promoting bounded ideation and premature fixation to early design concepts ( e . g . , see Robertson et al . , 2007 ) . These drawbacks have mainly been attributed to the use of complex interfaces which do not assist the evolution and pace of designers’ thoughts ( e . g . , see Israel et al . , 2009 ) and to overly - defined models which lead designers to commit to decisions prematurely , preventing the explora - tion of alternative ideas ( Chandrasekera , 2015 ) . Virtual prototyping techniques involve the use of an interactive environment in which visual , haptic and auditory modalities are fused together and where it is possible to carry out tests with users for validating the functional , esthetic and ergonomic aspects of design solutions ( Gowda et al . , 1999 ; Wang , 2002 ) . Compared to more traditional screen - based digital prototypes , virtual proto - types allow designers to physically interact with the product and see the design from an ‘inside out’ perspective ( e . g . , see Carulli et al . , 2013 ) . The interactive environments used for this purpose include Virtual Reality ( in which the user’s body , or part of it , is integrated in the virtual environ - ment , e . g . , Kawaguchi et al . , 2009 ) , Augmented Reality ( in which the virtual product is overlaid with the real - world environment , e . g . , Nee et al . , 2012 ) , and Mixed Reality systems ( in which some features of the virtual product are integrated as physical components into the real environment , sometimes by means of haptic systems , e . g . , Tang et al . , 2020 ) . Various virtual prototyping techniques and applications have been proposed as a way to validate different typologies of products ( Bordegoni et al . , 2010 ) . Research on virtual prototypes has mainly highlighted the potential for these tools to facilitate the development , iteration and analysis of designs ( e . g . , Baytar , 2018 ; Bordegoni et al . , 2008 ; Chu & Kao , 2020 ) . In particular , in the fields of mechanical and industrial engineering , researchers have extensively used virtual prototyping techniques for testing and improving design solutions ( e . g . , Choi & Chan , 2004 ; Mahdjoub et al . , 2010 ; Zorriassatine et al . , 2003 ) . Virtual prototyping has also proven to be an effective tool in allowing designers to recognize design problems and errors early in the product development process ( Bordegoni et al . , 2010 ; Park et al . , 2008 ) . More relevant to our work , within the Augmented Reality ( AR ) field , Spatial Augmented Reality ( SAR ) systems ( in which digital content is projected on to the surface of a physical prototype ) have proven to be a useful means for the creation , sharing and evaluation of design representations in co - design sessions ( e . g . , Ben Morosi et al . , 2018 ; O’Hare et al . , 2020 ; Rajeb & Leclercq , 2013 ) . In particular , compared to other digital and virtual prototyping techniques , SAR technology has been 144 M . A . NERONI ET AL . found to produce a more immersive visualization , an easier interaction and a better comprehension of the design representations , and to facilitate idea sharing and gestural communication between participants ( both experts and non - experts ) in design sessions ( Morosi et al . , 2018 ; O’Hare et al . , 2020 ) . 3 . Exploratory design workshops The relevant literature suggests that ( 1 ) increasing the variety of available research approaches for design cognition would be beneficial , ( 2 ) the potential of VR ( and VR games ) has not been fully explored or exploited in design research , especially for design cognition studies , and ( 3 ) design , build - and - test activities are increasingly being conducted with the use of digital and virtual tools , which have implications for design cognition . These three points motivated us to investigate the opportunities for studying design cognition using VR design - build - test games . In particular , we wanted to understand what was involved in implementing such a VR - based research approach , including the benefits , drawbacks and limitations . Our research interests were therefore methodo - logical , focussing on how this general approach could be used to observe , record and study design cognition , rather than addressing any specific research question related to design cognition . We report on our exploratory workshops here to illustrate the opportunities that VR - based design - build - test games offer for studying design cognition . We conducted two workshops using a VR design - build - test gaming platform . Each workshop consisted of a series of activities that would allow us to collect data on various aspects of design behavior . In particular , we attended to concept development and refinement so that divergent and convergent thinking were likely to be evident ( e . g . , Tversky & Chou , 2011 ; Ulrich , 2004 ) . By permitting ‘rationed’ build , test and evaluation activities we simulated the resource - consuming nature of these activities ( e . g . , Menold et al . , 2017 ) . Running group design sessions also allowed us to develop a scenario characterized by interactions between people with different types and levels of design specialization ( e . g . , see Thomke , 1998 ) and to observe activities such as idea generation , concept selection and solution refinement being performed as team activities ( Sonalkar et al . , 2013 ; Toh & Miller , 2016 ) . The design challenge that we set in each workshop required devising a means of moving an object from one place to another . This might best be characterized as ‘conceptual design’ ( including elements of ‘embodiment design’ ) where ‘task clarification’ has already been performed and the problem is defined entirely in terms of technical objectives and constraints ( e . g . , see Pahl & Beitz , 1996 ) . In this sense , it is similar to some popular project - based learning assignments in engineering education ( Verner & Ahlgren , 2004 ) although the ‘unfamiliar world’ of VR with its ‘uncertain physics’ also represents some elements of advanced technical projects ( Bickler , 1998 ) . To provide better context for our later discussions about the opportunities that such approaches might offer , some brief details about our workshops are provided in the Participants and Format sections that follow . We then illustrate the types of Data we obtained and provide some examples of the types of analyses which could be conducted using such data . Our Data section does not aim therefore to provide a full characterization of the design behavior observed in our workshops but instead to emphasize how the collected data could be used to study various issues that are relevant to design cognition . This is intended to stimulate other researchers to imagine similar or different studies which could address a wide range of research questions . 3 . 1 . Participants We recruited two different groups of participants and studied the behavior of each group in a separate workshop . Group 1 comprised six postgraduate design students ( one female ) , drawn from the University of Cambridge . Group 2 comprised seven professional design engineers ( two females ) , drawn from Cambridge Consultants , an international product design and technology INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 145 consultancy . Running workshops with these two groups allowed us to test our method with participants whose primary interests ranged from design research and education on the one hand , to design practice and training on the other . All participants gave informed written consent prior to the commencement of each workshop . The procedures were approved by the local ethical review committee . 3 . 2 . Format The VR hardware used was an HTC Vive ( HTC , 2018 ) , which provides users with a headset and two hand - held controllers . The software used was the VR version of the game ‘Fantastic Contraption’ ( Northway Games , n . d . ) , in which players are required to design and build a device to perform a specific task ( see Discussion and Appendix for consideration of other suitable technologies and games ) . The game includes two modes . The ‘design mode’ allows players to design their devices using the available elements ( e . g . , motorized wheels and structural connections ) . The ‘test mode’ allows players to model the behavior of the designed devices under the action of gravity , friction , collisions and other physics - based simulations . When in the ‘design mode’ all these simulations are switched off ( i . e . nothing moves ) and the behavior of the device needs to be anticipated or imagined . By activating the ‘test mode’ ( i . e . pressing the ‘play’ button on the controller ) , the physics is switched on and the behavior of the device , including its interaction with the environment , can be observed directly . Each workshop took the form of a design exercise during which participants worked as a group to solve a problem . During the workshop , only one of the participants ( i . e . ‘the VR operator’ ) interacted with the VR platform . The rest of the group watched his ( the operator was male in both workshops ) interaction with the system , talking to each other and with the operator . In both workshops , the VR operator’s activities during the game ( including the utterances they made while playing ) were recorded using the Fraps screen recording software ( Beepa , 2013 ) . The rest of the group interactions and the utterances they made were captured with video and audio recordings made using a wide - angle camera which was set up to record the whole room ( Figure 1 ) . In conducting the workshops , we were able to collect multifaceted data that permitted us to explore the opportunities for using VR games to research different types of behavior related to design cognition ( see Table 1 ) . 3 . 3 . Data During each workshop’s two build - and - test phases , we were able to record the participants enga - ging in activities of designing and constructing devices and then simulating their behavior relative to the requirements of the design problem ( e . g . , see Figure 2 ) . Here , we outline the kinds of data that were collected or derived from the workshops . In particular , we emphasize data related to ( 1 ) concept generation , ( 2 ) concept refinement , ( 3 ) learning through making , ( 4 ) participant engagement and ( 5 ) reflective practice . 3 . 3 . 1 . Concept generation During the paper - based initial ideation phase , the groups sketched their proposed ideas to solve the problem with only limited understanding of the ‘rules’ and ‘physics’ that would apply in the game environment ( see Figure 3 ) . Collectively , the participants in Group 1 sketched 27 ideas , of which 15 ( 56 % ) were unique ( the remainder being duplicates of other ideas , either within or across partici - pants of the same group ) . In Group 2 , the participants represented 44 ideas , of which 27 ( 61 % ) were unique ideas . To characterize the region of the solution space explored by the two groups , all 42 unique ideas ( we do not here consider repetitions between groups ) were classified in relation to the type of device designed . In both groups , almost half of the ideas ( 53 % in Group 1 and 48 % in Group 2 ) involved 146 M . A . NERONI ET AL . the design of an additional platform ( e . g . , bridge , slide , moving fabric ) to span the gap . Around a third ( 33 % in Group 1 , 26 % in Group 2 ) involved the use of mechanically activated devices for throwing the ball ( e . g . , catapult ) . Very few ideas consisted of large mechanically activated devices ( e . g . , giant gap - spanning car ) that could autonomously carry the ball to the goal without the need for an additional structure such as a bridge ( 7 % ideas in Group 1 and 11 % ideas in Group 2 ) . During the first build - and - test phase , the two groups developed concepts that typically used a large number of components as they attempted to explore a variety of possible solutions ( see Figure 4 ) . In the second build and test phase the additional constraint led participants to change their perspective on the problem and solution : they started thinking about how to ‘get the ball to the goal’ rather than how to ‘build a contraption to move the ball’ . As shown in Figure 5 , during this phase both groups converged on essentially the same design concept ( named ‘falling rod’ by Group 1 and ‘unbalanced structure’ by Group 2 ) and , through iteration , reached the same ‘zero - components’ solution . This solution involved introducing and extending one component to move the ball to a position above the goal , then deleting that component before pressing ‘play’ ; under the action of gravity , the ball would fall into the goal . 3 . 3 . 2 . Concept refinement At various stages during the build - and - test phases , the groups developed one concept from another or refined their concepts to make them more suited to solving the design problem . We represent this here in the form of graphs that include data related to both the process of designing ( i . e . time taken to design the solutions , number of components used ) and the performance of the design outputs ( i . e . functional vs . nonfunctional solutions ) as well as the verbal comments made by the participants while designing . One thing that is notable here is the pace of concept development , with just minutes separating a suggested concept and the building and testing of that concept ( see Figures 6 and 7 ) . Figure 1 .

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 149 A similar data representation can be used to compare the performance of the two groups . For example , during the second build - and - test phase , both groups quickly converged on the same general concept – and , upon iteration , reached the same ‘zero - components’ variant of that concept . However , a deeper inspection of digital data obtained through the platform revealed that the design process that led them to reach that solution was different in terms of the number of tested concepts and types of iterations ( see Figure 8 ) . Data about the participants’ behavior can also be subjected to more quantitative analysis on the performance of the two groups ( see Table 2 ) . For instance , during the first build - and - test phase , Group 1 spent an average of 303 seconds developing the three selected concepts , adding 13 . 67 components on average ( SD = 3 . 51 ) and subtracting a mean number of 4 . 33 components ( SD = 5 . 86 ) . They ran a total of seven tests on three designs , of which two were successful ( i . e . ideas able to satisfy the design problem ) . Group 2 spent an average of 353 seconds designing each idea , adding 31 . 33 components on average ( SD = 7 . 57 ) and subtracting 3 . 33 components on average ( SD = 2 . 89 ) . Although they used the ‘test mode’ of the game more than was permitted ( they ran 17 tests ) , they did not develop a successful solution . During the second build - and - test phase , Group 1 spent an average of 23 . 3 seconds to develop and refine a design solution , adding overall 0 . 33 components on average ( SD = 0 . 58 ) , and subtracting overall a mean of 0 . 33 component ( SD = 0 . 58 ) . They ran a total of three tests on two concepts , of which two were successful . Group 2 spent an average Figure 2 . Screenshot showing a device developed by Group 2 during the first build - and - test phase of their workshop , as seen from the VR operator’s perspective . The problem to be solved was how to move the ball ( shown here at the apex of the device’s structure ) from the platform in the foreground to the space envelope indicated by the ( pink ) cuboid on the platform in the background . The image shows a simple double - beam ‘bridge’ spanning the gap with a ‘car’ holding the ball ( the four ‘wheels’ are self - powered ) . 150 M . A . NERONI ET AL . of 21 seconds developing a successful design solution , adding overall 0 . 2 components on average ( SD = 0 . 45 ) and subtracting overall 0 . 2 components on average ( SD = 0 . 45 ) . They ran a total of three tests on five designs , of which two were successful ( i . e . design able to satisfy the design problem ) . 3 . 3 . 3 . Learning through making The way in which the workshops were structured , and the use of the VR environment , allowed us to directly observe how the participants learned about the problem during their making activities . In the initial ideation phase , the lack of knowledge about the ‘world’ ( including the rules , physics and Figure 3 . Examples of sketches generated by participants in Group 1 and Group 2 during the initial idea generation phase . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 151 constraints ) , allowed participants to freely explore the problem space and consider various design possibilities , regardless of their feasibility . Indeed , 52 % of the unique ideas generated by the groups during this phase would ultimately not meet the design specifications ( 5 of the 15 unique ideas generated by Group 1 ; 17 of the 27 unique ideas generated by Group 2 ) . These ideas included all those that either could not be fabricated from the available materials ( e . g . , bouncing structures ) or were not functional within the physics of the game ( e . g . , ‘flying’ structures ) . Identifying a clear boundary between feasible and infeasible ideas was possible thanks to the use of a digital platform that allowed a large but still bounded exploration of the solution space ( defined by the constraints of the game ) combined with the possibility to test the proposed design concepts . This preliminary list of ideas was updated and substantially shortened when those who had been generating the ideas shared them with the VR operator , who by this time had become aware of the constraints imposed by the environment . However , in both groups , participants developed more specific knowledge about the problem when they had the opportunity to build and test some of their developed design concepts . For instance , while designing their first concept ( the ‘bridge’ ) , partici - pants in Group 1 realized that it was not possible to design a structure directly ‘on the goal’ area and that they would instead need to extend such a structure from the ‘construction’ area . In this case , rather than reassessing how the problem could be solved in light of their new understanding of it , they adapted their existing concept to conform to that new understanding . Also , while iterating their first chosen concept ( the ‘roller’ ) , participants in Group 2 realized that resizing or changing the Figure 4 . The three concepts developed by each group for the first build - and - test phase . The concept names are those given by the participants . 152 M . A . NERONI ET AL . inclination of a device could allow them to solve the problem ( i . e . moving the ball to the goal ) without increasing the complexity of the design ( i . e . adding more components to the built concept ) . Another example of how the participants’ increased understanding of the problem shaped their design behavior can be traced in the second build - and - test phase . The ‘zero - components solution’ discovered by the two groups during this phase did not appear in any of their earlier drawings , notes or discussions . Clearly their concept generation was not restricted to the use of sketches and discussions , but also occurred during wide - ranging build - and - test explorations . In relation to this , the comments that the participants made during the workshops revealed that they recognized the importance that the ‘test mode’ of the game had during the process of designing , for both learning about the problem ( i . e . understanding the material properties , defining the space available to build the device ) and iterating the designs ( i . e . recognizing the flaws in their ideas and exploring new variants ) . For example , a participant in Group 1 commented : ‘We couldn’t think about the falling rod [ i . e . their final solution ] without the possibility of testing’ . Compared to only studying design outcomes ( such as sketches ) , our continuous on - screen observation of the participants’ design behavior also allowed us to identify the ( different ) design strategies that the two groups developed to solve the problem . Group 1 adopted a ‘problem - focussed’ strategy : they tried to fully understand the problem before making solution attempts ( see Hay , Duffy , et al . , 2020 ) . This behavior was particularly evident during the first build - and - test phase , when participants developed each concept step - by - step . They started building a very primi - tive version of each concepts , adding to it and refining it through iteration . This design approach is Figure 5 . Concepts from each group for the second build - and - test phase . The concept names were those given by the participants . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 153 also reflected in the comments that the participants made while designing . For example , they said ‘Let’s give it a go . We don’t know if the ball rolls’ ; ‘Let’s put the ball here and see if it goes through the sticks’ ; ‘There is no need to completely build the structure . It can work as it is . . . we never know’ . Eventually , this behavior allowed participants to develop a deeper understanding of the physics of the ‘world’ they were designing for ( e . g . , the effects of gravity and friction ) and the properties of the materials available to them ( e . g . , variations in length and stiffness ) . Indeed , two of the three design concepts they developed during this phase were tested successfully . In contrast , Group 2 adopted a ‘solution - focussed’ strategy : they approached the design problem through solution conjectures , rather than through problem analysis . During the first build - and - test Figure 6 . Graph showing the number of components used in the development of Concept 1 from Group 1 , as a function of time during the first build - and - test phase ( in which the aim was to explore the potential of different ideas ) . The concept that the group eventually arrived at ( tested at t = 435s ) consisted of a main triangular structure with a diagonal sliding platform attached to it . When gravity was activated , the ball rolled on the sliding platform to the goal . This concept was developed from earlier , simpler concepts that were built but not always tested . 154 M . A .

Graph showing the number of components used in the device concepts developed by Group 1 and Group 2 , as a function of time during the second build - and - test phase ( in which the aim was to design a device by using the minimum number of components ) . The two groups initially selected the same concept for further development ( here labeled ‘Concept A’ ) . Group 1 referred to this as an ‘unbalanced structure’ and Group 2 referred to it as a ‘falling rod’ . Through iterative build - and - test cycles , both groups converged on the same ‘zero - components solution’ . Both groups referred to this as ‘dropping the ball’ . Group 2 arrived at the ‘zero - components solution’ after exploring an intermediate option which they referred to as ‘throwing the ball’ . 156 M . A . NERONI ET AL . phase , participants in this group were generally very confident about the feasibility of their concepts . They fully developed each concept and only made subtle adjustments to their designs throughout the various iterations ( e . g . , resizing a component , changing the inclination of a structure ) . Also , during the second build - and - test phase , Group 2 took longer ( 70 seconds for Group 1 ; 105 seconds for Group 2 ) to reach the ‘zero - components’ solution and were able to reach this solution only after receiving a prompt from the researcher ( i . e . ‘do you think it is possible to build a simpler design ? ’ , they replied : ‘it is a trap ! ’ and started exploring other design alternatives , e . g . , ‘throwing the ball’ ) . 3 . 3 . 4 . Participant engagement Participants in both groups reported enjoying the workshops ( scoring out of 5 , Group 1 : M = 4 . 83 , SD = 0 . 41 ; Group 2 : M = 3 . 83 , SD = 1 . 17 ) . These high levels of reported enjoyment likely result from a combination of the game - like format of the challenge and the level of presence associated with working in a VR environment ( or interacting with someone who is in that environment and whose actions and effects were visible ) . The use of a professionally - developed game platform allowed the process of learning how to build and test designs to be very intuitive . In both workshops , the VR operators took approximately 15 minutes to familiarize themselves with the VR platform and its interaction possibilities . After this time , they were able to use that platform to build and test things without further assistance from the researcher . In addition , the VR operators’ comments collected during this phase highlighted their appreciation of the game ( e . g . , ‘This is amazing ! ’ ) and their desire to further learn about the environment ( e . g . , ‘Can I try to build something up and see if it bounces ? ’ ) . With regards to the level of presence participants experienced , their answers to the two follow - up questions revealed that the opportunity to interact with an immersive design scenario was one of the main benefits that they derived from the workshop . Comments from Group 1 included : ‘It was an enjoyable way to explore design itself’ ; ‘It was a nice meta - session to be involved in as a design student ! ’ ; ‘I previously supposed VR would be a device mainly for entertainment and was not suitable for practical work like design [ . . . ] . But this workshop showed that it was actually very useful , at least in idea generation . ’ Comments from Group 2 included : ‘The study was specifically related to my own profession of engineering design and thus made the VR experience even more relevant and interesting ! ’ ; ‘It was enlightening to see how far VR technology has come in the past few years and , for the first time , see it as something that could be a valuable design tool , as opposed to just a novelty item’ ; ‘It was good to see how VR could be used as an instant prototyping engine for brainstorming’ . A further benefit of the participants’ enjoyment of the workshop , or at least their anticipation of such enjoyment , was that it facilitated participant recruitment . For instance , the professional designers expressed strong interest in being involved in the events before they commenced and also later indicated their interest in any longer events that might be planned for the future . Recruiting professionals is often described as a challenge for design research and so if participating in VR - based studies is seen as a positive opportunity to learn about and use a new technology then that is an advantage to researchers , at least for now . 3 . 3 . 5 . Reflective practice Being immersed in an environment which permitted exploring , developing and testing a wide range of ideas gave participants the opportunity to reflect on their design behavior and identify weak - nesses . This was particularly evident during the wrap - up phase of the workshops when participants articulated a number of opportunities for making their design processes more efficient . ● Spending more time learning about the problem : ‘We could have explored more the physics of the game , so we could know more about the behaviour of the various materials’ ; ‘We could have tried more basic things , such as how fast the wheel can turn , how heavy are things’ . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 157 ● Using testing feedback more efficiently : ‘We could have built one thing and another and try them at the same time’ ; ‘I don’t know if it is possible , but maybe modifying the design while the simulation is going’ ; ‘Instead of building the whole structure , we could have done some - thing like build - and - test , build - and - test , etc . [ for individual components ] ’ ) . ● Making a more efficient plan for the tested design concepts : ‘We could have started from the “tumble wheel” and explored it more , instead of going for the easier and more obvious things’ ; ‘We only considered very simple ideas and very complex ideas . We didn’t explore in between . We didn’t do the “moving arm” or the “conveyor belt” . These could be all possible solutions’ . ● Taking more risks : ‘We always started from something we trusted . . . we didn’t experiment too much’ ; ‘We actually think unidirectionally . . . For instance , we only [ laid ] out the rollers [ with the axle ] parallel to the ground . We didn’t put them vertically and use them as a rotating system’ . ● Avoiding fixation ‘I definitely recognise some of the “pitfalls” , such as having what I think the design should roughly look like in my head and then inevitably designing something like it’ . As the comments above indicate , by exploring , developing and evaluating their ideas and resulting concepts , the participants identified features of their own design behavior that could be improved . These reflections could be used to improve future design performance ( see related discussion in the following section ) . 4 . Discussion The objective of this article is to illustrate the opportunities that VR - based design - build - test games offer for studying design cognition . The specific approach we followed in the workshops offers many features that would be difficult to replicate with any single traditional research approach . We discuss these features below . 4 . 1 . Direct observation of longitudinal design behavior The structure of our workshops combined with the use of a VR platform gave us the opportunity to simulate longitudinal design behavior in a controlled laboratory - based setting . Most controlled design cognition studies focus on specific design activities , such as idea generation , concept refinement or outcome evaluation . In doing so , they provide only a snapshot of the design process . The process of designing is instead a dynamic , constructive process during which designers continuously re - structure their design concepts through the acquisition of new information or feedback ( Cross , 1982 ) . In our workshops , by observing participants’ design behavior through more of the process of designing ( albeit still over a short time period ) , we were able to observe how they progressed from rough ideas ( developed during the initial idea generation phase ) to more detailed Table 3 . Design behavior for Group 1 and Group 2 in the second build - and - test phase . Each row describes a separate test . ‘Concept name’ indicates how the group referred to the concept tested ; ‘Time taken’ indicates the time spent designing and iterating each concept ( in seconds ) ; ‘ # Added components’ and ‘ # Subtracted components’ indicates variation in the component count from one concepts to the concepts ; ‘ # Components’ indicates the total number of components in the tested concept ; ‘ # Tests’ indicates how many tests were performed while working on each idea ; ‘Test outcome’ lists the sequence of test results for each idea ( S = success , F = failure ) . Concept name ( and number ) Time taken ( s ) # Added components # Subtracted components # Components # Tests Test outcomes ( in order ) Group 1 Falling rod ( 1 ) 57 1 0 1 2 F , S Dropping ball ( 2 ) 13 0 1 0 1 S Group 2 Unbalanced structure ( 1 ) 34 1 0 1 2 F , S Throwing ball ( 2 ) 41 0 0 0 2 F , F Dropping ball ( 3 ) 30 0 1 0 1 S 158 M . A . NERONI ET AL . and refined concepts ( developed during the later build - and - test phases ) . For example , we noticed that , for both groups , the final zero - component solution was ‘discovered’ during build - and - test activities as they refocussed on the problem of moving the ball and detached from the idea that the means to achieve this had to be a mechanical system . The idea that designers are simultaneously exploring problem and solution variants in the search for a good match is often described as the ‘co - evolution’ of problem - and solution - spaces ( e . g . , see Fischer & Nakakoji , 1991 , 1992 ; Maher & Poon , 1996 ; Maher , 1994 ) . This concept has been used to analyze protocol studies of experienced designers working under laboratory conditions ( Dorst & Cross , 2001 ; Maher & Tang , 2003 ) and the meeting records of commercial design projects ( Wiltschnig et al . , 2013 ) . However , when drawings and words are the basis of design work , the feedback that designers receive on potential design performance is weak ; where design projects progress through successive build and - test - cycles , co - evolution can be a lot more complex ( Crilly & Moroşanu Firth , 2019 ) . In our workshops , test - failure was often the source of information about the problem - solution match , and acted as the stimulus to reframe the problem ( e . g . , when the ball had to be moved ) or the solution ( e . g . , whether a powered device was required at all ) . By combining the control of laboratory studies with the freedom to rapidly build and test a wide variety of design concepts , the method we propose here could provide a way to efficiently and systematically study how co - evolution plays out when problems and solutions are both discovered through making . 4 . 2 . Multifaceted data collection Our approach gave us ready access to continuous and multi - faceted information sources , including paper - based data ( e . g . , annotated sketches ) , verbal data ( e . g . , protocols of group discussions , verbal utterances recorded while interacting with the game ) and digital data ( e . g . , digital object manipula - tions , physical gestures , technical performance of the design outputs ) . One limitation of most design cognition research is that it is characterized by variation in : ( 1 ) how the different methods are applied , ( 2 ) the type of data that can be collected through these methods , and ( 3 ) the ways in which this data is analyzed ( for discussion see Blech et al . , 2019 ; Cash et al . , 2016 ; Crilly , 2019b ; Panchal & Szajnfarber , 2017 ; Wallace & Gruber , 1989 ) . These observations have led several design researchers to acknowledge the need for a more rigorous research approach for studying design ( for a discussion see Boujut & Blanco , 2003 ; Crilly & Cardoso , 2017 ; editorial board of IJDCI , 2013 ; Goldschmidt & Tatsa , 2005 ) . The method we propose here may address these needs by providing : ( 1 ) a unique tool for observing various types of design activities which address different research questions related to those activities , ( 2 ) multiple streams of data , providing a multifaceted view of the design behavior , and ( 3 ) a more objective evaluation of design outcomes ( because design success is determined by physics simulations ) . Ultimately , these benefits can allow more comparable results within and between studies . For example , although in running our two workshops we did not aim to compare the performance of the two groups , the example results reported in Figure 7 and Tables 2 and Tables 3 show that this type of comparison is possible with the collected data , and that such comparisons might be made across studies in a way that is more repeatable and objective than in typical ideation studies ( see Vasconcelos et al . , 2018 ) . 4 . 3 . Easy prototyping The VR game that we adopted for our workshops permitted players to rapidly design , construct and test a wide variety of solutions , with very little training , and to do so at human scale with no apparent costs of construction , iteration , duplication or deconstruction . For example , our partici - pants could build and refine a catapult or a motor - driven car or a crane in a matter of only few minutes and test each of these under realistic physical simulations . These capabilities provide an opportunity to study an important aspect of design activities : the effects of failure on learning . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 159 Research on problem - solving in the area of product and process development shows that iterative trial and error ( or , more precisely , trial , failure , learning , correction and retrial ) is a significant feature of design , and that it plays a fundamental role in innovation ( Newell & Simon , 1972 ; Smith & Eppinger , 1997 ; Wheelwright & Clark , 1992 ) . Prototyping is also increasingly recognized as the means by which designers not only test , but also generate , explore , discover and refine their ideas ( see Gill et al . , 2011 ; Hess & Summers , 2013 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ) . Case studies of design cognition often emphasize the way in which creative work is performed directly ‘in the workshop’ , typically by those who are expert in manipulating physical materials ( e . g . , see Candy & Edmonds , 1996 ; Cross & Clayburn Cross , 1996 ; Roy , 1993 ) . In our workshops , the participants often developed their design concepts directly through making activ - ities , and for this we did not require them to possess expertise in manual work and nor did we need to provide them with extensive specialized facilities . We saw that even for novice users , making things in a virtual game platform was quite easy and did not obstruct cognition in the ways that are sometimes reported for physical and digital modeling ( Dorta et al . , 2016 ; Häggman et al . , 2015 ) . Despite the ‘artificiality’ of the virtual environment , our participants were demonstrably present in their making activities . This fits with prior work which suggests that the sense of presence in virtual prototyping is similar to that which is observed during physical prototyping while allowing for the more timely and cost - efficient evaluation of numerous design alternatives ( e . g . , see Choi & Chan , 2004 ; T . Huang et al . , 2007 ; Shiratuddin et al . , 2004 ; Zorriassatine et al . , 2003 ) . 4 . 4 . Engagement and motivation in the activities The VR game format used in our approach allowed us to provide an enjoyable experience for the participants , and possibly increased their level of motivation in the design activities ( see Alsawaier , 2018 ; Özhan & Kocadere , 2020 ) . This is relevant for studying cognition in design because much previous research suggests that intrinsic motivation drives creative work generally ( e . g . , see Amabile , 1996 ; Collins , 2010 ) and creative design work in particular ( see Cross , 2004 ; Moroşanu Firth & Crilly , 2018 ) . Studying design cognition in settings that do not foster such motivation either block the study of an important aspect of cognition or result in experimental artifacts even when motivation is not the subject of interest ( Amabile , 2018 ; Welch et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , during our two workshops , the participants were enthusiastic about their work on the design problem , excited to build and test the devices and satisfied ( or even celebratory ) when their designs were successful . This fits with other work suggesting that VR can be used to increase task motivation and promote design creativity ( see review by Gong & Georgiev , 2020 ) . VR games might thus offer useful opportunities to manipulate and measure the effect of intrinsic motivation , but also simply to conduct studies where low levels of motivation do not compromise research on other topics . The high levels of engagement and motivation that we observed led to instances where partici - pants continued designing regardless of the constraints . For example , during the first build - and - test phase of the workshops , Group 2 tested their design ideas more than was permitted and despite a researcher issuing a reminder of this restriction . Observations like this have previously been used as a way to operationalize participants’ engagement in study activities such as game play ( Lomas et al . , 2013 ; Weber et al . , 2011 ) and gambling ( Kassinove & Schare , 2001 ) . This could allow factors such as engagement , enthusiasm , motivation and commitment to be measured without the need for self - report instruments . Designing studies to encourage motivation can also be realized by using non - VR computer games ( Neroni & Crilly , 2019 ; Neroni et al . , 2017 ) or any platform that provides immediate feedback to increase intrinsic motivation ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . However , using a VR environment has the additional advantage of increasing the levels of immersion and presence in the task ( Muhanna , 2015 ) , thus mitigating the constraints associated with designing only by using a mouse , keyboard or joystick while sitting in front of a computer screen . What remains to be seen is how long - lasting these effects are . They might diminish over time , either for participants returning 160 M . A . NERONI ET AL . to undertake a task in a context that is no longer novel , or for new participants for whom the technology might become increasingly familiar as it becomes more widespread . 4 . 5 . Opportunities for training and education Although we have focused on the research opportunities arising from our method for studying design activities , the basic setup has a number of other possible applications . For example , a similar or identical VR build - and - test platform might be used to improve design behavior rather than just studying it . Students or trainees could participate in a design challenge ( such as the one we used ) and then be invited to reflect on their process , teamwork and thinking , especially when their tests failed . In the VR workshops described here , because participants could see when their work was ineffective , they were able to later reflect on various weaknesses of the approaches that they had adopted . As such , studies like ours could usefully form the basis for training and development activities which aim to make people aware of their own design behaviors , including those that have limiting or negative effects . People often exhibit an ‘optimistic bias’ , underestimating their own susceptibility to risk ( Weinstein , 1980 , 1989 ) , or a ‘bias blind spot’ , believing themselves to be less biased than others ( Pronin et al . , 2002 ; West et al . , 2012 ) . Because of this , when people learn about their weaknesses from first - hand experience this is usually more powerful in motivating future behavior change than when they learn more generally about the weaknesses of the population that they belong to ( e . g . , see Helweg - Larsen , 1999 ; Norris et al . , 1999 ; Velde , F . W . van der et al . , 1992 ) . Taking fixation as an example of a design weakness , qualitative research has indicated that expert designers recognize previous fixation episodes and reflect on those episodes in future work to reduce the occurrence and influence of fixation ( Crilly , 2015 ) . Related experimental research has shown that if researchers are able to provide people with experiences that demonstrate their vulnerability to fixation then such demonstrations can decrease the likelihood of subsequent fixation episodes ( Neroni & Crilly , 2020 ; also see Sagarin et al . , 2002 ) . In the VR workshops described here , because participants could see when their work was ineffective , they were able to later reflect on various weaknesses of the approaches that they had adopted . As such , VR gaming platforms could provide a basis for developing ‘demonstrated vulnerability’ treatments for creativity training activities . By constructing novel and challenging design scenarios and incor - porating ‘traps’ which emphasize unhelpful behaviors , we might accelerate individual or group recognition of weaknesses in design behavior , and thus the rate of learning and improvement ( see Burleson , 2005 ) . In addition , in running our group sessions , we found that our proposed approach has the potential to provide team - building opportunities for groups who need to work together on design tasks or on other tasks that involve a creative approach to problem solving . The ‘strange world’ that the participants are designing for and building in might prevent any sense that anyone in the team ‘should’ be an expert , perhaps reducing any inhibitions about poor performance in front of others . Within and outside the design field , ‘X - reality’ technologies have already been used as a collaborative design tool , providing a better avenue for information exchange in team environ - ments ( Iorio et al . , 2011 ; Johanson et al . , 2002 ; Morosi et al . , 2018 ; O’Hare et al . , 2020 ) . 5 . Challenges and limitations Despite the opportunities outlined above , we also identified challenges arising from a VR - based approach for studying design cognition . Some of these challenges and limitations relate to the specific application of our proposed approach to study design cognition , while others concern the more general use of VR as research tool . We summarize them below . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 161 5 . 1 . Challenges arising from the use of our approach for studying design cognition First , although VR offers a fully controllable environment that permits simulation of many ‘real - world’ activities , it is still an artificial environment that does not completely act like the real world . This can be an advantage if researchers are interested in how designers work in new contexts or with unfamiliar physics which they are required to learn about ( for an example of this in designing for space missions , see Bickler , 1998 ) , but it could be a problem if researchers are trying to simulate and study typical ‘real world’ scenarios . For example , in running our workshops , we observed that 52 % of the ideas generated by the groups during the initial idea generation phase ( when participants did not have specific knowledge about the world that they would interact with ) were ‘infeasible design concepts’ that either could not be constructed given the available materials or were not functional within the physics of the game . To avoid this , in future studies researchers may initially instruct participants on the specific physics characterizing the VR platform being used , or more generally , ‘the rules of the game’ . Second , the collection of a large quantity of multifaceted data can give rise to data handling issues and problems with isolating the variables of interest . Similar issues have been identified and resolved with the use of other research technologies such as eye tracking ( e . g . , see Duchowski , 2007 ; Pekkanen & Lappi , 2017 ) , and future research using VR platforms can take inspiration from these studies to develop and implement methods to streamline and automate data collection and analysis . Third , our observed high level of engagement and motivation in the task ( from the post - experimental interview and the participants’ comments throughout the activities ) may have been heightened by the novelty of the study design , over and above the tool being used . To control for this possibility , future studies may involve multiple design sessions . This would allow researchers to observe and control for any effect of the experience in using a VR tool when performing design activities . Finally , when used in a collaborative design setting , some VR tools ( like the one used in our workshops , which allowed only one person to inhabit the VR space ) may limit interaction between team members and unevenly distribute the level of immersion that is typically associated with the use of VR tools . We might thus have expected high levels of engagement from our operators but comparative disengagement from the other participants . However , this is not what we found when running our workshops . Indeed , the comments obtained from the groups during the post - experimental phase revealed that having the possibility to visualize the various design activities ( including the feedback associated with those activities ) appeared to increase the whole groups’ level of presence and motivation in the process of designing , despite most individuals not directly interacting with the VR environment . On the other hand , differences in these individual’s roles and knowledge ( resulting from having vs . not having a direct experience of the VR environment ) may reflect a typical co - design scenario characterized by ‘collaborative’ work between people with different knowledge and design expectations , including non - experts ( e . g . , Masclet et al . , 2021 ) . Nevertheless , to avoid this limitation , future studies could permit multiple users to inhabit the same virtual space and interact with the same virtual objects ( Du et al . , 2017 ; Havig et al . , 2011 ; Moraes & Machado , 2007 ; Shattuck , 2018 ) . The use of such collaborative virtual spaces is likely to become increasingly important and so too is the study of how design is – and can be – conducted in them ( Cascini et al . , 2020 ) . 5 . 2 . Challenges arising from the use of VR as research In running our workshops , we also identified four main limitations arising from the use of VR as research tool . First , although VR is becoming widespread in many design fields and in commercial projects contexts , it is typically not one in which designers are yet often trained . With this in mind , the 162 M . A . NERONI ET AL . design activity and game platform that we used are most directly analogous to those design disciplines where the development of physical systems is the objective and where the building and testing of such systems are relevant to satisfying that objective ( e . g . , mechanical engineering ) . For design disciplines such as electronics and software design , where things like lengths , masses , forces , and accelerations are less relevant , the direct manipulation of virtual building blocks ( rods , motors , etc . ) would be less applicable . However , VR tools are increasingly being developed for interacting with and exploring a wide range of symbolic systems ( e . g . , see Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . Game developers can use this knowledge for developing VR games tailored to the various design disciplines or including different modes that can be applicable to the various design contexts . On this last point , for example , the inclusion of an additional sketching interface ( inspired by VR sketching platforms ) may offer a further opportunity to study idea generation digitally ( e . g . , Oti & Crilly , 2021 ) . See the Appendix for a list of available VR games that are suitable for studying design cognition . Second , although VR technology is continuously being improved and becoming more afford - able , it is still expensive , complex and fragile compared to more traditional media . To prevent participants’ concern in the event of equipment failure , we warned them that the game might crash ( although this only happened once ) . In addition , when selecting or developing suitable tasks for studying design cognition , it can be difficult to arrive at tasks that are adequately controlled and yet flexible enough to permit the generation of multiple design solutions . In the present investigation , we tried to circumvent this limitation by using a game which was quite constrained in terms of available materials ( to gain sufficient levels of experimental control ) but permitted wide - ranging responses using those materials ( to permit a design space to be freely explored ) . To provide researchers with a wider range of opportunities to study design cognition , game developers can include ‘level builder’ or ‘level editor’ options that allow users to modify different features of the game ( e . g . , change the objectives , constraints and opportunities ) and create , store and share their own challenges . Such functionality can be used by researchers to create design scenarios that simulate specific design disciplines or contexts , address specific research questions or promote specific types of design behavior , all of which could be made available to other researchers . Third , wearing the headset for long periods of time can produce fatigue and an unsettling feeling of enclosure . In particular , ‘VR sickness’ ( with symptoms such as headaches , drowsiness , and disorientation ) are reported to affect many VR users ( LaViola Jr , 2000 ; Sharples et al . , 2008 ; Tanaka & Takagi , 2004 ) . To minimize these problems , before conducting our group workshops , we ran two pilot studies with individual participants designing in VR for different durations . At the end of each workshop , we also administered a questionnaire ( Kennedy et al . , 1993 ) which is typically used to assess simulation sickness ( Balk et al . , 2013 ) . This preliminary investigation allowed us to judge the maximum time that we felt a participant could work in the VR space and play the game without suffering any problems . Consequently , during the two group workshops , the VR operator never stayed in the VR space for more than 30 minutes and no VR sickness was observed or reported . We recommend that future studies should conduct similar preliminary checks to establish suitable durations of VR exposure for the specific tasks that are being considered and the specific technology being used . Finally , the use of VR as research tool may have the risk of self - selection by the participants , biasing the sample toward people with an orientation to technology . However , this is not something that we found when running our workshops . Indeed , when we asked participants , at the end of the workshops , how much experience they had in using VR , we found that out of 13 participants , only 3 of them had previously used VR more than 5 times . Nevertheless , we recommend that , to better characterize the experimental sample , future studies should collect information about the partici - pants’ previous experience in using VR or similar technologies ( e . g . , augmented reality ) . This may also allow researchers to set up a VR design group session based on real expertise differences ( i . e . participants with more experience in using VR could be the VR operators ) , rather than randomly assigning the participants to different roles ( as we did in our sessions ) . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION 163 6 . Conclusions Virtual design - build - test games offer a number of opportunities for the study of design cognition . Perhaps most importantly , they permit participants to rapidly construct a wide variety of solution types at large scales , with no apparent costs ( to the participant ) and minimal training . This allows participants to freely design through making , with the discovery opportunities that this presents , and without some of the challenges that come with other digital or physical means of production . In addition , the approach we illustrate here permits ( i ) a continuous and multifaceted record of design behavior ( because that behavior is expressed through a digital platform which permits a variety of recorded outputs ) , ( ii ) the objective evaluation of design outcomes ( because of design success is determined by physics simula - tions ) , ( iii ) direct observation of different phases of the design process and different design activities ( because the exploration development and evaluation of ideas can be performed on one platform ) , and ( iv ) high levels of engagement in the activities ( because of the immersive nature of the interface and the clear demonstration of success or failure ) . Furthermore , an approach such as the one we used here offers a useful basis for developing interventions in design education and practice , where reflecting on design behaviors and design outcomes can be used to motivate and support future improvement . These various aspects of virtual design - build - test games render them a valuable methodological option ( either by themselves or in concert with other approaches ) for studying and improving different aspects of design cognition .
