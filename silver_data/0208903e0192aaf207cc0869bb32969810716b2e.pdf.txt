Early studies of TFs revealed their well - structured DNA binding domains ( DBDs ) andidentified functionallycrit - ical activation domains ( ADs ) required for tran - scription . ItlaterbecameevidentthatmanyADs contain intrinsically disordered low - complexity sequence domains ( LCDs ) , but how LCDs activate transcription has remained unclear . Although it is known that transcriptional activation by LCDs requires selective interaction with bind - ing partners , it has been challenging to direct - ly measure selective LCD - LCD recognition in vivo and unravel its mechanism of action . RATIONALE : Traditional biochemical recon - stitution and genetics studies have identified most of the molecular players central to tran - scription regulation . However , the mechanism bywhich weak , dynamic protein - protein interac - tions drive gene activation in living cells has remained unknown . Advances in live - cell single - molecule imaging have opened a new frontier for studying transcription in vivo . In this study , we used synthetic LacO ( Lac operator ) arrays as well as endogenous GGAA microsatellite loci to study LCD - LCD interactions of TFs such as EWS / FLI1 , TAF15 , and Sp1 in live cells . To probe the dynamic behavior of TF LCDs attarget genomicloci , wehave combined CRISPR - Cas9 genome editing , mutagenesis , gene activation , cell transformation assays , andvarioushigh - resolutionimagingapproaches including fluorescence correlation spectroscopy , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching , lat - tice light - sheet microscopy , three - dimensional DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization , and live - cell single - particle tracking . RESULTS : Live - cell single - molecule imaging revealed that TF LCDs interact to form local high - concentrationhubsatbothsyntheticDNA arrays and endogenous genomic loci . TF LCD hubs stabilize DNA binding , recruit RNA poly - merase II ( RNA Pol II ) , and activate transcrip - tion . LCD - LCD interactions within hubs are highlydynamic ( secondstominutes ) , selectivefor binding partners , and differentially sensitive to disruption by hexanediols . Thesefindingssuggestthatunderphysiologicalcondi - tions , rapid , reversible , and selective multivalent LCD - LCDinteractionsoccurbe - tween TFs and the RNA Pol II machinery to activate transcription . We observed formationoffunctional TFLCDhubs at a wide range of intranuclear TF concentra - tions . Although we detected apparent liquid - liquidphaseseparationwithgrossoverexpressionofLCDs , transcriptionally competent TF LCD hubswereobservedatphysiologicalTFlevelsatendogenouschromosomallociintheabsenceofdetectablephaseseparation . Inaddition , muta - genesis , gene expression , and cell transforma - tion assays in Ewing ’ s sarcoma cells revealed a functional link between LCD - LCD inter - actions , transactivationcapacity , andoncogenic potential . CONCLUSION : The use of various imaging methods in live cells powerfully complements in vitro studies and provides new insights into the nature of LCD interactions and their role in gene regulation . We propose that trans - activation domains function by forming local high - concentration hubs of TFs via dynamic , multivalent , and specific LCD - LCD interactions . It also seems likely that weak , dynamic , and transient contacts between TFs play a role in disease - causing dysregulation of gene ex - pression ( i . e . , EWS / FLI1 in Ewing ’ s sarcoma ) , suggesting that LCD - LCD interactions may represent a new class of viable drug targets . Although we examined a small subset of TF LCDs , the principles uncovered regarding the dynamics and mechanisms driving LCD - LCD interactions may be applicable to other classes of proteins and biomolecular inter - actions occurring in many cell types . ▪ RESEARCH Chong et al . , Science 361 , 378 ( 2018 ) 27 July 2018 1 of 1 The list of author affiliations is available in the full article online . * Corresponding author .

We used live - cell single - molecule imaging to reveal that TF LCDs form local high - concentration interaction hubs at synthetic and endogenous genomic loci . TF LCD hubs stabilize DNA binding , recruit RNA polymerase II ( RNA Pol II ) , and activate transcription . LCD - LCD interactions within hubs are highly dynamic , display selectivity with binding partners , and are differentially sensitive to disruption by hexanediols . Under physiological conditions , rapid and reversible LCD - LCD interactions occur between TFs and the RNA Pol II machinery without detectable phase separation . Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms underpinning transcriptional control and suggest a framework for developing single - molecule imaging screens for drugs targeting gene regulatory interactions implicated in disease . S equence - specific DNA binding transcrip - tion factors ( TFs ) are preeminent players in eukaryotic gene regulation . From the earliest studies of human TFs , it was rec - ognized that regulatory proteins such as Sp1 contain well - structured DNA binding do - mains ( DBDs ) and functionally critical trans - activation domains that participate in specific TF - TF interactions to direct gene transcription ( 1 – 3 ) . Numerous atomic structures of DBDs have provided a concrete understanding of TF - DNA interactions . In contrast , many transactivation domains contain low - complexity sequence do - mains ( LCDs ) that persist in an intrinsically disordered conformation not amenable to con - ventional structural determination . Mutations in TF LCDs not only disrupt transcription but also have been implicated in cancer and neuro - degenerative disorders ( 4 , 5 ) . However , the mechanism by which TF LCDs execute specific transactivation functions has remained an enig - ma . Elucidation of how LCDs operate in vivo , given the dynamic nature of TF - TF interactions required for gene regulation , has been an equally challenging problem . Several in vitro studies have suggested that purified LCDs from the FET protein family ( FUS , EWS , andTAF15 ) canundergoreversiblehydrogel formation or liquid - liquid phase separation at high concentrations and low temperatures ( 6 – 8 ) . Moreover , the C - terminal domain of RNA poly - merase II ( RNA Pol II ) is itself an LCD and can undergophaseseparation ( 9 ) andbeincorporated into FET LCD hydrogels in a phosphorylation - regulated manner ( 10 ) . FET LCDs were also re - ported to undergo phase separation in live cells upon overexpression ( 7 , 11 ) . However , stark differences exist between in vivo physiological conditions and those used for in vitro or overexpression studies . Temper - ature , protein concentration , purity , and micro - environment may all substantially affect the behavior of LCDs . There is also a vigorous debate as to whether LCDs undergo cross - b polymer - ization or remain in a disordered conformation when interacting with partners ( 6 – 8 , 11 – 17 ) . From the perspective of elucidating how TFs work in vivo , an equally pressing unresolved mechanistic question concerns the dynamics and time scales governing LCD - LCD interac - tions that would allow TFs to function in rapid cellular processes . Selectivity of cognate LCD - LCD interactions is another important yetpoorly understood feature that is required for proper TF function in vivo . Thus far , selective LCD - LCD recognition has not been directly demonstrated in vivo , let alone understood at a mechanistic level . Inthisstudy , wecombinedavarietyofhigh - resolution imaging strategies — including fluo - rescence correlationspectroscopy ( FCS ) ( 18 , 19 ) , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) ( 20 ) , lattice light - sheet microscopy ( 21 ) , three - dimensional ( 3D ) DNAfluorescenceinsituhybrid - ization ( FISH ) ( 22 ) , and live - cell single - particle tracking ( SPT ) ( 23 , 24 ) — to probe the dynamic behaviorofTFLCDsattargetgenomiclociunderphysiologicalconditions . Synthetic LacO arrays mediate formation of LCD interaction hubs We first established proof - of - concept experi - ments by using a synthetic Lac operator ( LacO ) array ( ~ 50 , 000 LacO repeats ) integratedintothe genome of human U2OS cells ( 25 ) that express various enhanced yellow fluorescent protein ( EYFP ) – taggedTFLCDsfusedtotheLacrepressor ( LacI ) ( Fig . 1A ) . To probe potential sequence specific LCD - LCD interactions , we examined two distinct classes of LCDs : QGYS - rich LCDs from the FET family and a QGTS - rich LCD from Sp1 thatislowintyrosine ( tableS1 ) ( Q , Gln ; G , Gly ; Y , Tyr ; S , Ser ; T , Thr ) . As expected , the LacO array recruits a large number of EYFP - LCD - LacI molecules via targeted DNA binding , forming a concentrated local inter - action hub in the nucleus . LacO - associated hubs formed by LCD - LacI but not LacI are visible by bright - field microscopy ( Fig . 1B ) , suggesting that the refractive index and mass density of LCD - LacI hubs differ considerably from the surround - ing nuclear environment . We found that both TAF15 - LacI and Sp1 - LacI give rise to much brighter and larger LacO - associated LCD hubs than LacI alone . To quan - tify this effect , we used two orthogonal methods tomeasuretheproteinconcentrationsinlivecells . Specifically , we performed fluorescence intensity and FCS measurements of intracellular protein and compared the results with standard concen - tration curves of a purified fluorescent tag ( EYFP or mCherry ) calibrated by the same method ( fig . S1 ) . Next , we estimated the absolute protein copy number in each hub by using the average in - hub protein concentration ( fig . S2A ) and hub dimen - sions measured in single - cell images ( fig . S2B ) . The two independent concentration measure - ments consistently showed that the LCD - LacI copynumberintheLacO - associatedhubincreases with the TF nuclear concentration much faster than with LacI alone and reaches levels up to orders of magnitude greater than the number of LacO repeats available for direct LacO - LacI binding ( Fig . 1C and fig . S2 , C and D ) , suggest - ing likely cooperative multivalent interactions atthe LacOarraythatiscontributedbyextensive LCD self - interactions . Similarly , smaller LacO ar - rays containing substantially fewer ( ~ 15 , 000 ) LacO repeats similarly nucleate LCD self - interactions ( Fig . 1D and fig . S2 , E and F ) . Moreover , LCD - LacI but not LacI alone can form hundreds of smaller puncta throughout the nucleus once its intranuclear concentration reaches a certain threshold ( Figs . 1B and 2A , and fig . S2 , G and H ) . LCDs can form intranuclear punctain somecaseseven without being fused to a DBD such as LacI ( Fig . 3A , bottom ) . These re - sults suggest that LCD - LCD interactions can promote self - assembly of LCD hubs upon over - expression without assistance from DNA ( 7 , 11 ) . In addition , FRAP dynamics of LCD - LacI at the LacO array was also significantly different RESEARCH Chong et al . , Science 361 , eaar2555 ( 2018 ) 27 July 2018 1 of 9 1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , CA , USA . 2 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of California , Berkeley , CA , USA . 3 CIRM Center of Excellence , University of California , Berkeley , CA , USA . 4 Janelia Research Campus , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Ashburn , VA , USA . * Corresponding author .

S3 , A and B ) , such differences can be attributed tochangesindissociationrates . Specifically , when we fit the FRAP curves with a reaction - dominant model ( 26 ) , we found that fusing TAF15 or FUS LCD to LacI leads to more than 60 % reduction in the dissociation rate constant of LacI ( fig . S3 , C to F ) . This result suggests that at increased local TF concentrations , TF LCD hubs driven by LCD - LCD interactions stabilize TF binding to its cognate genomic site via multivalent contacts that could include both DBDs for tethering to chromatin and one or more LCDs within TF proteins that can form multiple transient inter - actions with different partner proteins . LCD hubs interact with RNA Pol II Having demonstrated homotypic LCD self - interactions , we next investigated the potential role of heterotypic LCD - LCD interactions in hub formation . First , we tested whether TF LCD hubs can interact with RNA Pol II in vivo by using a LacO - containing U2OS line in which we replaced the endogenous RPB1 ( major and catalytic sub - unit of RNA Pol II ) with an a - amanitin – resistant Halo - tagged RPB1 ( 27 ) . We subsequently labeled the cells with a fluorescent HaloTag ligand and visualized RNA Pol II distribution in vivo . We found that mCherry - FET - LacI expression mediates significant enrichment of RNA Pol II in LacO - associated hubs compared with background levels recorded using LacI alone ( Fig . 1 , F and G , and fig . S4 , A to C ) . Moreover , self - assembled LCD - LacI hubs that are unaffiliated with a LacO array also enrich RNA Pol II ( fig . S4D ) , suggesting that LCD hubs interact with RNA Pol II potentially without assistance from DNA . While recapitulat - ing the in vitro incorporation of RNA Pol II into LCD hydrogels ( 10 ) , these experiments go one step further and suggest that LCD hub formation can facilitate the recruitment of the general transcription machinery in vivo — a key step toward transactivation . LCD - LCD interactions are sequence specific and differentially sensitive to hexanediol disruption Next , we probed the sequence specificityof inter - actions between various classes of LCD .

Error bars represent bootstrapped SD ( 45 ) . RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE end , we coexpressed both EYFP - LCD - LacI and mCherry - LCD in LacO - containing cells . mCherry - LCDlackingaDBDbecomesenrichedatthearrayonlywhenitcaninteractwiththecoexpressedLCDthatisfusedtoLacI ( Fig . 2A and fig . S5A ) . Notably , the array can enrich mCherry - LCD over awiderangeof expression levels . TheEWS - LacI – bound LacO array also enriches endogenous EWSR1 , as detected by immunofluorescence ( fig . S5B ) . Therefore , mCherry - LCD enrichment at the array is most likely due to specific LCD - LCD interactions rather than potential nonspecific overexpression artifacts . Using this two - color imaging assay , we confirmed homotypic self - interactions of all tested LCDs ( from the FET family and Sp1 ) . Intriguingly , although all three FET LCDs interactedamong themselves , none of theminteracted with the Sp1 LCD ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , suggesting that LCD interactions exhibit strong sequence specificity that is likely an es - sential feature underlying combinatorial TF reg - ulation of gene expression . To better understand the nature of LCD - LCD interactions , we treated cells with 1 , 6 - hexanediol ( 1 , 6 - HD ) , an aliphatic alcohol known to dissolve variousintracellularmembranelesscompartmentsandFUShydrogelsinvitrothroughdisruptionofhydrophobicinteractions ( 28 – 30 ) . We observed that both FUS and Sp1 LCD hubs rapidly dis - assemble within 30 s when exposed to 10 % 1 , 6 - HD . TheLacO - associatedLCD – inducedhubshrank to a size comparable to that of the array bound by LacI alone , whereas all nuclear puncta not associated with LacO disappeared ( Fig . 2C and Movie 1 ) . We also found that 2 , 5 - hexanediol ( 2 , 5 - HD ) , a less hydrophobic derivative of 1 , 6 - HD that barely melts FUS hydrogels in vitro ( 28 ) , disrupts LCD hubs less efficiently in live cells ( fig . S5 , C and D ) . This correlation between hydrophobicity of hexanediols and LCD hub melting suggests that these aliphatic alcohols may directly in - fluenceLCD - LCDinteractions by disrupting key hydrophobic contacts . These in vivo results also mirrorin vitro hydrogelstudiesusingthesesame disrupting agents ( 28 ) . Sp1 LCD hubs were disrupted significantly faster and more extensively than FUS LCD hubs with 2 or 5 % 1 , 6 - HD ( Fig . 2D ) . Thus , although a combination of intermolecular forces may con - tribute to LCD hub formation , our results in - dicate that hydrophobic interactions might be more sensitive to disruption and play a more dominant role in Sp1 LCD self - interactions than FUS LCD , consistent with the Sp1 LCD contain - ing hydrophobic residues sparsely interspersed among Q repeats ( 31 ) . The differential sequence dependence of LCD - LCD interactions revealed by 1 , 6 - HD treatment may be correlated to the selectivity of homo - and heterotypic LCD inter - actions observed above . LCD - LCD interactions are highly dynamic To study the dynamics of protein - protein inter - actions between LCD pairs , we coexpressed Chong et al . , Science 361 , eaar2555 ( 2018 ) 27 July 2018 3 of 9 Fig . 2 .

LacO array – associated and self - aggregated non - array – affiliated FUS LCD hubs in live cells are quickly disrupted by 10 % 1 , 6 - hexanediol ( related to Fig . 2C ) . RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE EYFP - LCD - LacI and Halo - LCD in the LacO - containing U2OS cells and performed SPT of Halo - LCD to measure residence times ( RTs ) of LCD - LCDinteractionswithintheLacO - associated hub ( Fig . 3A , top ) . For all LCDs tested , RTs re - sulting from self - interactions fell in the range of 11 to 33 s ( Fig . 3B ) . When EYFP - LCD and Halo - LCD from the FET family were coexpressed at high levels , theyspontaneously formedhubsthat are unaffiliated with the array and resemble in - tranuclear puncta ( Fig . 3A , bottom ) . These non - arrayhubsbindHalo - LCDviahomo - orheterotypic interactions with even shorter RTs ( 7 to 10 s ) . As expected , the Sp1 LCD that failed to interact with the FUS LCD had an RT of < 1 s at the non - array FUS LCD hubs ( Fig . 3B ) . The fact that RTs of many LCDs in self - aggregated hubs unaffiliated with genomic DNA are substantially shorter than in hubs formed at the LacO array suggests that TF - DNA interactions that maintain a high local concentrationofTFLCDscontributetostabilizingLCD - LCD interactions and vice versa . Together , these findings reveal the rapid , reversible , and interdependent nature of LCD - LCD and TF - DNA interactions as well as their propensity to form local high - concentration hubs that likely stabilize multicomponentcomplexes — e . g . , transcriptionpre - initiationcomplex , aprerequisitefortransactivation . EWS / FLI1 forms hubs at endogenous GGAA microsatellites Having unmasked the sequence specificity and dynamicnatureofLCD - LCDinteractionsbyusing synthetic LacO arrays in living cells , we next tested LCD behavior at native GGAA micro - satellites ( > 20 GGAA repeats ) in the Ewing ’ s sarcoma cell line A673 ( 32 – 35 ) . These cancer - derived cells carry a chromosomal translocation t ( 11 ; 22 ) ( q24 ; q12 ) producing a fusion oncogene , EWS / FLI1 , that encodes a potent TF consisting of a trans - activating LCD from EWSR1 and the DBD from FLI1 that targets GGAA sequences ( Fig . 4A ) . To visualize the behavior of endogenously expressed EWS / FLI1 , we fused a HaloTag to its DBD using CRISPR - Cas9 – mediated genome edit - ing of A673 cells ( Fig . 4 , A and B , and fig . S6A ) ( 36 ) . This knock - in strategy allowed us to image fluorescently tagged endogenous EWS / FLI1 at its normal expression levels ( Fig . 4B ) , which was essential because LCDs tend to self - aggregate and behave aberrantly upon overexpression . To ensure that Halo - tagging does not disrupt trans - activation functions of EWS / FLI1 , we confirmed that EWS / FLI1 - Halo activates a luciferase reporter construct containing a GGAA microsatellite – driven promoter ( 33 ) as efficiently as wild - type ( WT ) EWS / FLI1 ( fig . S6C ) . More importantly , using the gold standard neoplastic transforma - tion assay ( 37 ) , we confirmed that the EWS / FLI1 - Halo knock - in A673 cells form colonies in soft agar much like the WT A673 cells — albeit , less efficiently ( fig . S6 , D and E ) . We next performed high - resolution lattice light - sheet microscopy and found that EWS / FLI1 forms many small interaction hubs ( > 1000 pernucleus ) inthenucleus ( Fig . 4CandMovie2 ) . The detected number of intranuclear hubs has thesameorder of magnitudeas thetotalnumber of EWS / FLI1 - bound GGAA microsatellites across the human genome ( ~ 6000 ) estimated by chro - matin immunoprecipitation sequencing and bio - informatics analyses ( 38 ) . To examine the spatial relationship between EWS / FLI1 hubs and GGAA microsatellites , we performed simultaneous con - focal imaging of EWS / FLI1 - Halo and 3D DNA FISH targeting genes adjacent to GGAA micro - satellites that are regulated by EWS / FLI1 ( Fig . 4D ) , including CAV1 , FCGRT , ABHD6 , KDSR , and KIAA1797 ( 33 , 39 ) . Although EWS / FLI1 enrich - mentisdetectedatmanysinglelociofthesegenes , the crowded distribution of intranuclear EWS / FLI1 hubs makes it difficult to clearly visualize EWS / FLI1 enrichment at single target loci . By recording images of ~ 1000 loci for each gene , the signal - to - noise ratio is markedly improved to revealspecific EWS / FLI1 enrichmentatGGAA repeats , whereasnoenrichmentwasseenatnon - GGAA gene loci ( Fig . 4E ) . These results indicate that EWS / FLI1 forms hubs at endogenous GGAA microsatellite DNA elements . Dynamic EWS LCD - LCD interactions mediate formation of EWS / FLI1 hubs We previously showed that because of LCD - LCD interactions , the LCD - LacI copy number in the LacO - associated hub increases much faster with the TF concentration than that of LacI alone , reaching levels that are orders of magnitude higher than the number of available TF bind - ing sites at the LacO array ( Fig . 1 , C and D , and fig . S2 , C to F ) . Using the methods established earlier , we estimated the intranuclear concentra - tion of endogenously Halo - tagged EWS / FLI1 in A673 cells to be ~ 200 nM and the median copy number of EWS / FLI1 per hub at GGAA micro - satellites to be 24 ( fig . S7 , A and B ) . It was re - portedthatmostEWS / FLI1 - boundmicrosatellites contain 11 to 19 GGAA motifs , with a median around 15 ( 38 ) . Because the DBD of FLI1 occupies two consecutive GGAA repeats ( 33 ) , the median Chong et al . , Science 361 , eaar2555 ( 2018 ) 27 July 2018 4 of 9 Fig . 3 .

Error bars represent SE . RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLE number of EWS / FLI1 molecules recruited to a microsatellite via direct DNA - protein interaction is estimated to be 8 . The fact that there are a significantly greater number of EWS / FLI1 mole - cules in a GGAA - affiliated hub than what direct binding to GGAA repeats could accommodate suggeststhat , like thesynthetic LacOarrays , these native genomic elements can also efficiently nucleate EWS LCD - LCD interactions to form localhigh - concentrationTFhubs . Moreover , when transiently expressing EWS / FLI1 - Halo or a Halo - tagged LCD deletion mutant ( FLI1 DBD ) in U2OS cells , we again observe that the total number of EWS / FLI1 molecules in the GGAA - affiliated hubs increasesmuchfasterthanFLI1DBDasafunctionofTFconcentration ( fig . S7 , C and D ) , providing strong evidence that LCD - LCD interactions occur at GGAA - affiliated EWS / FLI1 hubs . We previously observed that the formation of anLCDinteractionhubslowsdowndissociationofLCD - LacI from the LacO array ( Fig . 1E and fig . S3F ) . If LCD - LCD interactions are also involved in EWS / FLI1 hub formation at GGAA micro - satellites , we expect the RT of EWS / FLI1 within GGAA - affiliated hubs to be longer than that of EWS / FLI1 outside hubs . We stained the EWS / FLI1 - Halo knock - in A673 cells with two fluores - cent ligands ( 40 , 41 ) : High - concentration JF549 staining allows visualization of EWS / FLI1 hubs in the cell nucleus , whereas low - concentration PA - JF646 staining allows real - time tracking of individual EWS / FLI1 molecules ( Fig . 5A and Movie 3 ) . SPT revealed the average RTs of EWS / FLI1 in and outside the GGAA - affiliated hubs to be 90 and 16 s , respectively ( Fig . 5B and fig . S8 , A and B ) . The fact that EWS / FLI1 binds to GGAA repeats for a significantly longer time again suggests that EWS LCD - LCD interactions are involved in the formation of the GGAA - affiliated hubs . It is very likely that both LCD - LCD inter - actions and DBD binding to GGAA repeats work together to stabilize hub formation , much as we observed for LCD - LacI at the LacO array . To confirm that hub formation in this native setting is dependent on the EWS LCD , we de - termined how mutationsin the LCDmightaffect RTs of EWS / FLI1 .

Notably , when we replaced WT EWS in both fusion proteins with EWS ( YS m ) , mCherryenrich - ment at the array progressively decreased with an increasing number of Y - to - S mutations ( fig . S9A ) and vanished for EWS ( YS 29 ) , in which all tyrosines are replaced ( Fig . 5C ) . Similarly , we found that EWS ( YS 29 ) does not interact with Chong et al . , Science 361 , eaar2555 ( 2018 ) 27 July 2018 6 of 9 Fig . 5 .

By contrast , a mutant replacing all 29 tyrosines with phenylalanine ( F ) [ EWS ( YF 29 ) ] retains hub formation activity with itself and with WT EWS ( Fig . 5C and fig . S9D ) , suggesting that aromatic amino acids and hydro - phobic contacts represent major drivers of EWS LCD - LCD interactions . The conformational dis - order , proline residues , and acidic amino acids of the EWS LCD might play a role in keeping these key hydrophobic residues exposed to solvent and potential binding partners without being sequestered in a collapsed state ( 42 ) . Next , we probed the effects of mutations that disrupt LCD hub formation on RTs of EWS / FLI1 . To examine behaviors of EWS / FLI1 variants in A673 cells without interference of endogenous EWS / FLI1 , we generated an EWS / FLI1 knockout A673 line using CRISPR - Cas9 – mediated genome editing ( Fig . 4B and fig . S6B ) and verified that transiently and moderately reexpressed EWS / FLI1 - Halo in the knockoutline exhibited binding dynamics comparable to that of endogenous EWS / FLI1 - Halo ( Fig . 5 , B and D , and fig . S8C ) . We then transiently expressed similar levels of FLI1 DBD - Halo or a Halo - tagged 37 - residue Y - to - S mutant [ EWS ( YS ) / FLI1 ] . Both mutants still displayed some hubs in the nucleus , but the hubs are considerably diminished . SPT revealed that the in - hub RTs of the mutants become significantly reduced ( by 51 to 65 % ) relative to those of WT EWS / FLI1 , whereas their outside - hub RTs remain largely unchanged ( Fig . 5D ) . Together , these results confirm that LCD - LCD interactions drive the formation of EWS hubs at GGAA microsatellites . To measure the dynamics of just the protein - protein interactions occurring within the EWS LCDhubs , wetransientlyexpressedSNAP f - tagged EWS / FLI1andHalo - taggedEWSintheEWS / FLI1 knockout line and labeled both fusion proteins using fluorescent ligands with distinct emission spectra ( 40 , 41 ) . WhereasEWS / FLI1 - SNAP f forms hubs at GGAA microsatellites via protein - DNA binding , EWS LCD - Halo , whichdoesnotinteract with DNA , binds to EWS / FLI1 hubs only via protein - protein interactions . We visualized EWS / FLI1 hubs and simultaneously tracked individual EWS LCD molecules that bind to the hubs ( Fig . 5E ) . SPT revealed the average RT of EWS LCD in EWS / FLI1 hubs to be 16 s , which suggests that LCD - LCD interactions are highly dynamic ( Fig . 5F ) . As expected , the mutant EWS ( YS ) LCD has a significantly shorter RT ( ~ 7 s ) at EWS / FLI1 hubs , consistent with its diminished interaction with the EWS LCD . EWS LCD - LCD interactions are essential for transcription and transformation functions of EWS / FLI1 Finally , wetestedwhetherLCD - LCDinteractions influence EWS / FLI1 functions . We found that whereas EWS / FLI1 efficiently induces gene ac - tivation at a GGAA microsatellite in a luciferase assay , the mutant EWS ( YS ) / FLI1 and FLI1 DBD do not ( Fig . 5G ) . We further engineered the EWS / FLI1 knockout A673 line to stably express EWS / FLI1 or EWS ( YS ) / FLI1 and performed reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain re - action ( RT - qPCR ) to measure theexpression levels of GGAA microsatellite – associated EWS / FLI1 target genes . As expected , we found that expres - sion of EWS / FLI1 , but not EWS ( YS ) / FLI1 , specif - ically rescues the gene expression defect in the knockout line , indicating that EWS LCD - LCD interactions are required for transactivation ( Fig . 5H and fig . S10A ) . Moreover , the knockout line stably expressing EWS / FLI1 , but not EWS ( YS ) / FLI1 , forms colonies in soft agar like WT A673 cells ( fig . S10B ) . This demonstrates that EWS LCD - LCD interactions are required for oncogenic transformation . Taken together with previously published RT - qPCR and RNA sequencing data in mesenchymal stem cells showing the impor - tant role of EWS LCD in inducing expression of GGAA microsatellite – associated genes ( 43 ) , our results suggest that the formation of EWS LCD - dependent hubs is essential for EWS / FLI1 to activate transcription of these target genes and drive oncogenic gene expression programs in Ewing ’ s sarcoma . Discussion DNA binding TFs are key regulators of eukaryotic gene expression . Early studies of TFs revealed their well - structured DBDs and identified func - tionallycriticalactivationdomains ( ADs ) required for transcription . It later became evident that many transactivation sequences contain intrin - sically disordered LCDs , but how they mediate transactivation remained unclear . Despite the composition of LCDs and their generally unstruc - tured nature , ADs must interact with specific binding partners to activate transcription . How - ever , it has been challenging if not impossible to directly measure selective LCD - mediated tar - get recognition by ADs in vivo . Two other key aspects of transcriptional control mechanisms have also remained largely uncharted : What is the nature of the protein - protein transactions that drive gene activation , and how stable or dy - namicarethesecriticalinteractionsinlivingcells ? We addressed these problems by employing single - molecule imaging to visualize LCD - LCD interactions in live cells . Our findings indicate that TF - TF interactions are extremely transient , with RTs of 5 to 20 s and rarely longer than 1 min . These studies lead us to propose that transactivation domains function by forming transient local regions of high TF concentra - tions or “ hubs ” ( sometimes also referred to as clusters ) via dynamic , multivalent , and sequence - specific LCD - LCD interactions . A key future en - deavor will be to unlock the biochemical and structural basis for selective LCD - LCD inter - actions . Such selectivity is likely essential to implement the complex combinatorial logic of transcriptional regulation . Recent advances in live - cell single - molecule imaging have not only opened a new frontier for studying transcription in vivo but have also provided an opportunity to gain greater insight into the nature and behavior of LCDs and their propensity to remain largely as intrinsically dis - ordered peptide sequences . By deploying high - resolution single - molecule imaging of TF LCD interactions in live cells , our studies offer a pow - erful complement to pioneering in vitro studies that provided the first clues about LCD inter - actions ( 10 ) . Importantly , to the extent that one can make comparisons between hydrogels and intracellular LCD hub formation , many aspects of FET - LCD function uncovered in vitro are borne out within live cells . For example , the behavior of LCDs upon mutations , disruption by hexane - diols , and interaction with RNA Pol II observed in vivo are generally consistent with the role of LCDs proposed on the basis of in vitro assays . In addition , single - molecule live - cell imaging re - vealed several new aspects of LCD - driven inter - actions . Most notable are the fast dynamics and Chong et al . , Science 361 , eaar2555 ( 2018 ) 27 July 2018 7 of 9 Movie 2 . 360° view of a 3D image of endogenous EWS / FLI1 - Halo in an A673 cell nucleus ( stained with 200 nM Halo ligand JF549 ) taken on the lattice light - sheet microscope ( related to Fig . 4C ) .

We took time - lapse images with a 10 - s interval in the JF549 channel to visualize EWS / FLI1 hubs and imaged continuously in the PA - JF646 channel for SPTof individual EWS / FLI1 - Halo molecules ( related to Fig . 5A ) .

We were also in - triguedbytheformationofLCD - dependenthubs throughout the nucleoplasm that are not asso - ciated with cognate genomic DNA . These LCD interaction - driven puncta , which display a ca - pacity to interact with RNA Pol II , sensitivity to 1 , 6 - HD , and fast dynamics ( recovery times of 7 to 10 s ) , may provide an opportunity in future studies to further probe mechanisms govern - ing LCD - LCD – mediated hub formation and transactivation . To analyze the behavior of LCD - LCD inter - actions in live cells , we exploited the advantages of various imaging platforms and developed two distinct in vivo cell - based assays : one involving large synthetic TF binding site ( LacO ) arrays and the other targeting endogenous GGAA micro - satellite regulatory elements in the human ge - nome . Whenusedincombination , thetwoassays affordpowerfulandcomplementaryplatformsforprobingthepropertiesofTFLCDinteractionsinthelive - cell context . The highly reiterated LacO binding sites can serve as a useful cell - based assay system capable of nucleating local high - concentration hubs in vivo for any protein domain or LCD of interest through LacO - LacI mediated binding . These arrays can be readily detected by fluorescence imaging with a high signal - to - noise ratioandallowflexibilityinprobingvariousinter - action properties of LCDs while offering a con - venient alternative to various in vitro assays such as hydrogel polymerization and droplet forma - tion for studying gelation and phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins , two processes that are likely coupled with each other under certain physiological settings ( 44 ) . Our studies were not designed to address the structure and nature of LCD - driven phase separated compartments , but under certain over - expression conditions we detected what appears to be liquid - liquid phase separation ( i . e . , spherical shape and local changes in refractive index ) . Al - thoughwecan detectapparentliquid - liquid phase separation with gross overexpression of LCDs , we did not obtain evidence for phase separation of TF hubs ( i . e . , EWS / FLI1 ) formed at endoge - nous expression levels . However , transactivation by TF LCD hubs is observed at endogenous TF levels at native chromosomal loci in the absence of detectable phase separation . Given the tran - sience of LCD - LCD interactions and our direct measurementsofTFconcentrationsinthenucleusandwithinhubs , we surmise that LCD - dependent transactivation can occur in hubs formed over a broad range of TF concentrations ( 100 nM to 100 m M ) and time scales — from extremely brief specific and nonspecific LCD - LCD and TF - DNA binding events ( 0 . 1 to 1 s ) to assembly of rel - atively stable hubs ( minutes ) driven by specific , multivalent interactions . Both the composition and diversity of LCDs in hubs and their inter - action specificity could influence the range of their operational concentrations and their po - tential for phase separation and / or polymer formation . New insights regarding the rapid binding dynamics and functional importance of TF LCDs ( i . e . , LCD - dependent oncogenic po - tential of EWS / FLI1 ) suggest that understand - ing these mechanisms may also inform our ability to develop strategies to modulate gene expression in the context of disease . Given the transient interactions exhibited by TFs and the critical role of gene dysregulation in disease ( i . e . , EWS / FLI1inEwing ’ ssarcoma ) , ourfindings offer the potential to develop single - molecule imagingplatformstoscreendrugstargetinggeneregulatorypathways . In particular , we imagine that moderate - to high - throughput screens for geneexpressioninhibitorsoractivatorsbasedonhigh - resolution single - cell and single - molecule imaging could provide a strategy to probe large sectors of the proteome that have resisted tradi - tional in vitro and cell - based screens for small molecules . Withnewclassesofchemicals , natural products , or peptidomimetic libraries , it may even be possible to eventually target LCDs that are the key drivers of regulatory protein - protein interactions and hub formation involved in gene activationandpotentiallymanyotherbiomolecularinteractionsimplicatedindisease . Finally , al - though we examined only a small subset of TF LCDs , the fundamental principles that we have uncovered about the rapid dynamics and hub mechanismsdriving LCD - LCDinteractionsmay be applicable to other classes of regulatory pro - teins and biomolecular interactions occurring in a variety of cell types .
