Email : brian . meckes @ unt . edu & yong . yang @ unt . edu ABSTRACT : The mechanical properties and forces in the extracellular environment surrounding alveolar epithelial cells have the potential to modulate their behavior . Particularly , breathing applies 3 - dimensional cyclic stretches to the cells , while the stiffness of the interstitium changes in disease states , such as fibrosis and cancer . A platform was developed that effectively imitates the active forces in the alveolus , while allowing one to control the interstitium matrix stiffnesses to mimic fibrotic lung tumor microenvironments . Alveolar epithelial cancer cells were cultured on these platforms and changes in the glycocalyx expression were evaluated . A complex combination of stiffness and dynamic forces altered heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expressions . Consequently , we designed liposomal nanoparticles ( LNPs ) modified with peptides that can target heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulfates of cell surface glycocalyx . Cellular uptake of these modified nanoparticles increased in stiffer conditions depending on the stretch state . Namely , chondroitin sulfate A targeting improved uptake efficiency in cells experiencing dynamic stretches , while cells seeded on static stiff interstitium preferentially took up heparan sulfate targeting LNPs . These results demonstrate the critical role that mechanical stiffness and stretching play in the alveolus and the importance of including these properties in nanotherapeutic design for cancer treatment . Keywords : Mechanoregulators , Glycocalyx , Lung Device , Lipid Nanoparticle Introduction Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer - related death , worldwide with mortality rates of 22 % in 2022 . 1 High mortality rates stem from a combination of limited screening , 2 highly metastatic potential of cells , 3 , 4 relapse after common chemotherapeutic treatments , 5 and absence of efficient alternative treatment options . In response , nanotherapeutics are being developed to improve drug accumulation in tumor sites while reducing off - target effects . 6 – 10 Nanoparticles as therapeutic carriers for lung cancer are appealing because their unique size and structure designs allow them to maintain stability , cross biological barriers , 11 bind to multiple targeting ligands , 12 reduce non targeting cytotoxic effects of drugs , 13 and improve circulation times with improved loading capacity 14 and releasing efficiency . 15 – 18 Although , targeted delivery of modified nanocarriers to lung cells has been developed with the purpose of improving therapeutic outcomes , 19 – 23 few have reached clinical relevance 24 due in part to the unique delivery challenge that is imparted by the physical environment of the lung and absence of efficient alternative options . The structure and mechanics of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) plays a vital role in many cellular physiological activities , such as cellular growth , proliferation , migration , and differentiation . 25 – 27 In the lung alveolus , alveolar epithelial cells are exposed to 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) stretching cycles that coincide with breathing . Conventional culture models used to study nanotherapeutic delivery to alveolar cells do not effectively mimic this dynamic environment , thus they fail to reflect mechano - transmitted cues that play essential roles in many disease etiologies . 28 – 31 In lung cancer , the tumor microenvironment is remodeled into a fibrotic phenotype . 32 Specifically , the enhanced action of fibroblasts , fibrocytes , 33 – 36 and mesenchymal stems cells 37 in tumor microenvironment causes stiffening of the interstitial ECM , 38 , 39 on which epithelial cells reside . This stiffening process is known to affect how nanomaterials interact with epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts as increased stiffness promotes uptake of Au nanoparticles ( NPs ) while reducing uptake of carbon nanotubes . 40 – 44 However , designs that take advantage of substrate driven differences in uptake have not been realized nor have the effects of dynamic forces been included . Recent studies have highlighted the connection between tumor mechanical environment and the cell surface glycocalyx 45 – 48 – a dense sugar layer on the surface of cell membranes that acts as a mediator between cells and their environment . Changes in glycocalyx density and gene expressions were observed in some cancer cells on stiffer substrates . In the lung epithelium , the glycocalyx is composed primarily of hyaluronic acid , heparan sulfates , and chondroitin sulfates . 49 , 50 However , little is known about stiffness related changes in lung cancer epithelium glycocalyx and how this can be leveraged for nanoparticle targeting . To assess how fibrotic lung interstitium changes glycocalyx structures and nanoparticle entry , we adapted a recently reported cell culture platform 51 that applies a physiological 3 - D mechanical stretch to lung cancer epithelium . Cells grown on these platforms better mimic lung tissue properties such as tight junction formation , incident forces , and intercellular and cell - substrate interactions of lung epithelial cells . Using the biomimetic devices , we show that dynamic stretch forces combined with stiffness changes in the interstitium alter glycocalyx gene expression . In response , we synthesized lipid nanoparticles with specific glycocalyx recognition peptides on the surfaces . Specifically , chondroitin sulfate A ( CSA ) targeting liposomes imposed better uptake efficiency in a fibrotic , mechanically stretched environment of cancerous lung cells . In contrast , heparan sulphate targeting improved uptake in static fibrotic conditions . Together , these results highlight the importance of biomimetic dynamic stretch in designing nanoparticle therapeutics . Results & Discussion Fabrication and Characterization of Dynamic Alveolar Interstitium Platform In order to understand how mechanical environment and dynamic forces impact cell interactions with nanoparticles , we created a dynamic platform consisting of a cell culture chamber , an interstitium layer , and a pneumatic chamber ( Figure 1 ) , made of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) . A biomimetic nanofibrous membrane was placed on top of the interstitium layer , which was sandwiched between the cell culture chamber and the pneumatic chamber ( Figure 1B - E ) . The assembly between these parts was completed by using a PDMS thin film adhesive as we previously reported 52 ( See the Methods ) . Figure 1 . Design and characterization of the platform .

The structures of the layers were the same with different heights ( 8mm for cell culture layer , 1mm for interstitium layer and 4mm for pneumatic layer ) .

Original CCD images and the profiles ( black curve ) of the deformed PDMS membrane bonded on the pneumatic chamber ( upper frame ) or nanofibrous membrane on the interstitium bonded on the pneumatic chamber ( lower frame ) under a theoretical strain of 15 % ( yellow curve ) . The scales of axis x and y were the same . The nanofibrous membrane was generated by electrospinning a polycaprolactone ( PCL ) solution to mimic the nanofibrous basement membrane of alveolar epithelium since PCL nanofibrous membrane has been reported to support epithelium formation and favor cell - cell crosstalk . 53 – 55 The nanofibrous membrane had an average diameter of 820 ± 180 nm and an average pore size of 14 . 29 ± 6 . 33 μm 2 ( Figure 1D , F - G ) . The interstitium layer was prepared with PDMS and its stiffness was determined by tailoring the type and composition of PDMS to replicate the stiffness of normal ( 1 - 5 kPa ) and fibrotic ( 20 - 100 kPa ) lung tissues , 56 – 58 i . e . , PDMS Sylgard 527 for 5 kPa and a 10 : 1 ( w / w ) mixture of Sylgard 527 and 184 for 50 kPa , respectively . 59 The nanofibrous membrane was first oxygen plasma treated and coated with type I collagen , and then immobilized on the PDMS interstitium , thus allowing the cells to adhere to the nanofibers but not onto the PDMS upon seeding . As such , the nanofibers provided contact guidance for the cell to adhere and grow , while the interstitium only regulates the cells with its stiffness . Moreover , to imitate the breath movement , a theoretical 15 % linear strain was applied at a frequency of 0 . 2 Hz . When air was infused to the pneumatic chamber , the experimental observations of the strains of the PDMS membrane and the nanofibrous membrane immobilized on the interstitium agreed with the theoretical calculation ( Figure 1H ) , indicating that the 3 - D mechanical stretch was transmitted through the interstitium to the nanofibrous membrane , which provided mechanical stimulation to the adherent cells . Taken together , this platform provides a biomimetic system for evaluating nanoparticle targeting . Lung Epithelium Glycocalyx Gene Expression Changes in Response to Mechanical Environment With the goal of designing nanoparticles that target cells based partially on the cellular response to mechanical cues , we assessed changes in surface related proteins . Since lung epithelial glycocalyx changes are linked to cancer and fibrosis , 38 , 39 , 60 conditions where the mechanical properties of the interstitium are altered , we assessed how interstitium stiffness altered expression of key glycocalyx glycoproteins . For these studies , adenocarcinomic human alveolar epithelial ( A549 ) cells were grown on the platforms with either soft ( ~ 5 kPa ) or stiff ( ~ 50 kPa ) interstitium under either static or dynamic ( cyclic 3 - D stretch ) conditions . As controls , A549 cells were also grown on tissue culture plastic ( TC plastic ) . Once cells reached confluence , the A549 cells were collected , and the gene expression of key lung glycoproteins were assessed . Specifically , we examined the expression of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans versican ( VCAN ) and decorin ( DCN ) along with the heparan sulfate proteoglycans syndecans 1 , 2 , and 4 ( SDC1 , SDC2 , and SDC4 respectively ) using quantitative polymerase chain reactions ( qPCR ) ( Figure 2 ) . Figure 2 : Effect of substrate properties on glycoprotein gene expression . A - E ) Relative gene expression of SDC1 ( A ) , SDC2 ( B ) , SDC4 ( C ) , VCAN ( D ) , and DCN ( E ) in the epithelial cells grown on TC plastic , substrates with different stiffness that were under static or dynamic 3 - D stretching conditions . All changes are reported relative to GAPDH expression and cells grown on TC plastic . * * * * p < 0 . 0001 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 . 01 , and * p < 0 . 05 ; one - way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post - hoc analysis . All data is mean ± standard error of the mean . qPCR analysis showed that biomimetic interstitium chips changed glycoprotein expression greatly in comparison to TC plastic . Specifically , SDC1 and VCAN were upregulated and DCN was downregulated compared to TC plastic when placed on our biomimetic platforms regardless of stiffness or whether dynamic stretch was applied ( Figure 2A , D - E ) . SDC2 expression also increased in the cells grown on dynamic stiff substrates compared to TC plastic ( Figure 2B ) . Together , these results indicate that TC plastic does not accurately reflect mechanically driven changes in glycoprotein genes . In addition to changes relative to TC plastic , we observed significant changes in gene expression depending on the substrate stiffness and the presence of dynamic forces . Stiffness alone can affect glycoprotein gene expression . Specifically , elevated stiffness results in downregulation of VCAN and DCN compared to static soft conditions ( Figure 2D - E ) . However , stiffness related changes are not observed when dynamic forces are applied for these two genes . Specifically , we find that SDC1 and SDC4 expression is upregulated in cells grown on soft substrates compared stiff substrates when dynamic forces are applied , an effect that is not observed for static conditions . Conversely , increased expression of SDC4 is observed in cells on soft substrates only when dynamic forces are applied compared to other biomimetic substrates ( Figure 2C ) . Similarly , stiffness dependent SDC1 gene expression changes are only observed when dynamic forces are applied ( Figure 2A ) . Together , these results indicate that gene expression for glycoproteins are regulated by a complex combination of interstitium stiffness and dynamic forces . Neither stiffness nor dynamic forces are sufficient to reflect the diversity of gene expression changes observed here . To evaluate functional expression of glycoaminoglycans ( GAGs ) , we performed an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) on the glycocalyx collected from cells grown under different conditions ( Figure S1 ) . Our results show increased GAG expression , both for heparan sulfates and chondroitin sulfates , when cells are grown on biomimetic chips compared to TC plastic when pooled for all conditions . This is in agreement with our results at the proteoglycan level . Differences were also observed for chondroitin sulfate levels for static stiff on comparison to TC plastic and static soft conditions . However , there are no statistical differences for individual devices for heparan sulfates , most likely due to the sensitivity of the assay . Designing Peptide Functionalized Liposomes Targeting the Lunge Epithelium Glycocalyx Based on our observations that glycocalyx expression changes as function of dynamic stretch and stiffness of the supporting substrate , we designed liposomal nanoparticles ( LNPs ) aimed at facilitating uptake into cells depending on the mechanical environment . Since we observed differences in the expression of different types of glycoproteins , we sought to create LNPs that recognize specific GAGs . Known peptide structures derived from viral sources that interact with chondroitin sulfate A ( CSA ) , chondroitin sulfate C ( CSC ) or heparan sulfates ( HS ; see Table 1 for sequences ) were utilized for coating the LNPs . We note that these peptides ( and related ones ) often have cross - reactivity with other GAGs , but have chosen ones with higher affinity for each target . 61 – 63 The peptides were chosen due to our observations that chondroitin and heparan sulfates are regulated by mechanical forces and substrate stiffness . For these studies , we modified the peptides to include cysteines to allow easy functionalization using bioconjugation strategies . To facilitate coating of the LNP surface , peptide - lipid conjugates were synthesized by reacting to a maleimide terminated polyethylene glycol ( PEG 20 kDa ) lipid with our cysteine terminated thiols in anhydrous conditions ( Figure S2 ) . Peptide conjugates were subsequently purified using HPLC . Synthesis of conjugates was confirmed by labelling the peptide - conjugates with fluorophores in a two - step process . First , amines on the peptides were labelled with methyltetrazine by incubating conjugates with a N - Hydroxysuccinimide ester ( NHS ) methyltetrazine . Second , a trans - cyclooctene fluorophore was reacted with peptides and the product were run in a polyacrylamide gel . As a control , lipids without peptides were treated in the same way and no conjugation was observed . These results indicate that we successfully synthesized the lipid - peptide conjugates ( Figure S3 ) . Table 1 . Peptides used for targeting with Primary Recognition GAGs Peptide Sequence Primary Recognition GAG CERRIWFPYRRF Chondroitin sulfate C 64 CRTPPESYASVR Chondroitin sulfate A 63 CGRKKRRQRRRPQ Heparan sulfates 65 Next , we created base LNP structures consisting of 58 mol % 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) and 42 mol % cholesterol that were systematically extruded to 100 - nm diameters . The lipid - peptide conjugates were then incubated with the pre - formed liposomes to allow for spontaneous intercalation into the liposome ( Figure 3A ) . Dynamic Light Scattering ( DLS ) shows increased size upon incubation with peptide functionalized lipids ( Figure 3B ) that is consistent with the expected size shift for our peptide conjugates , indicating that we modified the liposome surface with the peptides .

B ) Dynamic light scattering size distributions for bare liposomes ( orange ) along with peptides targeting chondroitin sulfate A ( CSA , purple ) , chondroitin sulfate C ( CSC , Blue ) , and heparan sulfate ( HS , green ) . Effect of Mechanical Environment on Nanoparticle Uptake Next , we assessed whether there were differences in LNP uptake depending on the surface peptide and the culture conditions . For these studies , the liposomes were formulated with lipophilic fluorophores . First , we assessed LNP uptake in conventional screening conditions ( TC plastic ) . LNPs were incubated with A549 cells , and uptake was assessed via flow cytometry . In plastic conditions , unmodified liposome controls showed greater uptake than all targeting structures . HS LNPs enhanced uptake compared to the liposomes functionalized with CSC and CSA peptides ( Figure 4A ) . To assess whether mechanical environment altered LNP uptake , A549 cells were cultured on the alveolar interstitium platforms for 1 week to allow the cells to reach monolayer confluency . Again , we utilized soft ( 5 kPa ) and stiff ( 50 kPa ) conditions with either dynamic forces or static cultures to assess how environment affected nanoparticle uptake . Under static conditions , only HS targeting LNPs showed greater uptake into A549 cells grown on stiff substrates in comparison to soft and control ( non - targeting ) liposome . They also showed significant increases in uptake compared to unmodified control LNPs ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , dynamic conditions showed no improvement in HS targeting LNPs for cells on soft or stiff substrates . There was also no improvement in comparison to control LNPs . When dynamic stretch was introduced to the A549 cells , CSA targeting LNPs showed enhanced uptake into cells grown on stiff substrates in comparison to the controls ( unmodified liposomes ; Figure 4C ) . These results conclusively show that mechanical stiffness changes the uptake preference of different LNP formulations and the addition of dynamic forces further alters uptake preference . In summary , HS targeting improves uptake into cells grown on stiff static substrates , while CSA targeting peptides enhances uptake into the cells grown on stiff substrates only when subjected to dynamic forces .

All data is mean ± standard error of the mean . If we evaluate these results in the context of proteoglycan models , we observe that changes in proteoglycan content only partially explains nanoparticle uptake observation . We see that the upregulation of GAGs present in all our biomimetic models in comparison to conventional TC plastic can have a mixed effect . The lack of GAGs limits entry for targeted LNPs in all plastic conditions . However , increased GAG expression can either promote or inhibit uptake depending on the expression of surface GAGs cell surface . High levels of HS on cells grown in soft conditions do not necessarily improve entry for HS targeting LNPs . This result is in agreement with observations of others that GAG content is both necessary for entry with this peptide but potentially inhibitory at high levels . 65 – 68 These observations , along with our results , point to the need to explore multiple combinations of targeting as we have here in order to identify high performing formulations . Conclusion Alveolar epithelial cells are subjected to constant cyclic stretches and frequently encounter stiffer extracellular matrices ( ECM ) in a fibrotic or cancerous lung . We have devised a cell culture platform that mimics these dynamic and mechanical characteristics of ECM to study lung alveolar cells in vitro . Our studies demonstrate that the expression of cellular glycocalyx glycoproteins change depending on the mechanics and stretch state . Conventional culture conditions ( tissue culture plastic ) fail to accurately capture the glycocalyx changes driven by the physical environment . Our studies show that nanoparticle uptake is highly dependent on the physical environment . Whereby , screening of different formulations in biomimetic systems leads to the identification of different potentially therapeutically relevant LNP structures compared to conventional screening approaches . All these results together show the importance of considering ECM mechanics and dynamics when designing novel drugs / carriers . Future nanoparticle targeting studies in vitro would benefit from including physical attributes in targeting conditions . Collectively , it sets the stage for potentially bridging gaps between in vitro and in vivo models . Methods Safety Statement No unexpected or unusually high safety hazards were encountered . Fabrication of Alveolar Interstitium All the parts of the platform except the nanofibrous membrane were made by casting the mixture of PDMS ( Sylgard 184 , Dow Corning ) resin and curing agent at a 10 : 1 . 05 ratio ( w / w ) on the 3 - D printed molds , followed by a curing process at 75°C for 2 hours . Meanwhile , a thin PDMS membrane was prepared via spin - coating at 2500 rpm for a minute on a silicon wafer and curing at 75°C for an hour , and then bonded onto the pneumatic layer to construct the pneumatic chamber using a microtransfer assembly ( µTA ) technique that we previously developed . 52 Briefly , the pneumatic layer with the opening facing down was stamped on a PDMS adhesive layer , which was prepared by spin - coating a PDMS mixture on a silicon wafer at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds , and transferred onto the PDMS membrane , followed by curing at 75 °C for 1 hour under a compressive pressure of approximately 1 MPa . The pneumatic layer with the bonded membrane was then gently peeled off from the silicon wafer . The middle interstitium layer was prepared by first bonding the interstitium layer onto the pneumatic layer with PDMS membrane using µTA technique and then adding Sylgard 527 ( corresponding to 5 kPa normal lung tissue ) or a 10 : 1 mixture of Sylgard 527 and 184 ( 50 kPa fibrotic tissue ) into the interstitium chamber followed by curing at 75 °C for 4 hours . Prior to cell culture , the electrospun nanofibrous membrane was bonded to the cell culture layer using the µTA technique , treated with oxygen plasma at medium power setting for 1 min in a plasma cleaner ( Model PDC - 001 , Harrick Plasma ) , and bonded onto the interstitium layer . At last . Subsequently . phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( BioWhittaker , Lonza ) was added to the cell culture chamber to keep the fibrous membrane immersed and the whole platform was cured at 45 °C overnight . Electrospinning and Characterization of Nanofibrous Membranes A solution of PCL in 1 , 1 , 1 , 3 , 3 , 3 - hexafluoro - 2 - propanol ( HFIP , 10 % , w / v ) was electrospun to produce the nanofibrous membrane . Briefly , the PCL solution was loaded into a syringe with a gauge blunt - tipped needle as the spinneret and ejected using a syringe pump ( New Era Pump Systems Inc ) at a flow rate of 0 . 5 mL / hour . A square glass plate ( 4” x 4” ) was placed on an aluminum tap covered plate served as the fiber collector , which was displaced 16 cm away from the spinneret and grounded to the power supply . A voltage of 14 kV was applied to the spinneret using a DC power supply ( Spellman Bertan ) for 20 min . The nanofibrous membrane was sputter - coated by gold ( Denton Vacuum LLC ) and images were taken using a scanning electron microscope ( SEM , TM3030 Plus , Hitachi High - Technologies Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) . The pore size and fiber diameter were analyzed using ImageJ . Briefly , the images were adjusted using threshold command . The area of each pore was analyzed using the function of analyze particles . The diameter of fibers was measured by drawing a line across the fiber and measuring the length . Then , a histogram line graph was generated using Prism 8 ( GraphPad software ) to show the distribution of the measured pore areas or fiber diameter . Characterization of Mechanical Stretching The PDMS membrane bonded on the pneumatic chamber or the platform without the cell culture chamber were used for the mechanical stretch characterization . When air was infused into and withdrawn from the pneumatic chamber , the deformation ( strain ) of the PDMS membrane with / without the nanofibrous membrane immobilized on the PDMS interstitium was characterized using the same method we reported previously . 51 Briefly , the deformation of the membranes was captured using a charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( Model DMK 31 , The Imaging Source ) and the curvilinear profiles of the membranes were obtained using ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / index . html ) . The theoretical calculation of the linear strain was also detailed previously . 51 Cell Growth Human alveolar epithelial cells ( A549 ; Cat # : CCL - 185 , ATCC ) were cultured in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) with L - glutamine ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 μg / ml streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) . The nanofibrous membrane was coated with 50 μg / ml type I collagen ( Col I , rat tail , Corning ) overnight in the incubator . The cells were seeded at a density of 1 x 10 5 cells / cm 2 and cultured in the incubator of 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . The cells were cultured under static condition for 1 day , and then subjected to mechanical stretch continuously for 5 days and culture medium were refreshed every other day . qPCR Study of Cells Cultured in Different Conditions To observe cellular glycocalyx expression changes in static and dynamic culture interstitiums qPCR was performed . RNAqueous Micro Kit ( Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was used for RNA isolation following standard working protocol . Briefly , RNA isolation was confirmed in NanoDrop one ( Thermo Scientific ) . RNA samples were mixed with SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix with ezDNase ( Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific ) kit solutions to make cDNA library . Using SimpliAmp Thermal Cycler ( Applied Biosystems by thermo fisher Scientific ) , cDNA library was prepared . The primers for SDC1 , SDC2 , SDC4 , VCAN , DCN and GAPDH ( TaqMan Gene Expression Assays , Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific ) expression and TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was used with cDNA samples for qPCR . Standard protocols were followed for mixing , plating in a 384 well plate , and running qPCR on a LightCycler 480 ( Roche ) . Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) Study of Cells Cultured in Different Conditions Cells cultured in TCP , static and dynamic culture interstitiums were dissociated using 0 . 25 % trypsin ( with 2 . 21mM EDTA , 1X [ - ] sodium bicarbonate ) solution ( Corning ) . Then they were collected and mixed with previously formulated cell culture medium ( DMEM with L - glutamine supplemented with FBS , penicillin and streptomycin ) ( see methods for cell growth ) , maintaining 1 : 1 volume ratio with trypsin solution . The mixture was then centrifuged at 500xg for 5 mins and cell supernatant was collected . The supernatant was used as samples for CS ELISA kit ( TSZ Scientific , Biotechnology systems ) and HS ELISA kit ( TSZ Scientific , Biotechnology systems ) . Standard working protocol of the kits was followed for the assay . Cytation 5 imaging reader ( BioTek ) was used to read the plate for absorbance at 450nm when the assay was complete . Peptide - Lipid Conjugate Synthesis Peptides , purchased from Genscript with > 98 % purity , terminated with cysteines were reacted with twice the molar amount of 1 , 2 - Distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - Poly ( Ethylene glycol ) ( DSPE - PEG20kD ) maleimide in anhydrous DMSO with triethylamine overnight at 4 ℃ . Samples were purified on an Accela ultra - high performance liquid chromatographer with a gradient of triethylammonium acetate ( TEAA ) buffer ( 0 . 05 M ; pH 7 . 0 ) to 95 % acetonitrile with TEAA buffer ( 0 . 05 M ; pH 7 . 0 ) on a biobasic C18 column ( Thermo Electron Corporation ) . The concentration of peptide conjugates was determined by the standard Bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . To confirm successful synthesis of peptide conjugates , they were reacted with 10 : 1 Methyltetrazine - sulfo - N - Hydroxysuccinimide ester ( Met - NHS ) ( Click Chemistry Tools ) : Peptides for an hour at room temperature in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline ( DPBS ) ( BioWhittaker , Lonza ) . The conjugates were further incubated with 1 . 1 : 1 Cyanine 5 trans - cyclooctene ( AAT Bioquest ) : Met - NHS for a minute and run through NuPAGE 4 - 12 % Bis - Tris premade polyacrylamide gel ( Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The mini gel tank ( Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and PowerEase 300W ( Life Technologies ) system was used for running the electrophoresis . Electrophoresis ran for 1 hour at 120V to ensure complete running of load through the gel . The Gel was imaged in ChemiDoc MP Gel Imaging System ( BioRad Labnoratories Inc ) . Liposome Synthesis Liposomes were synthesized following the widely used thin film technique with 58 mol % 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ; Avanti Polar Lipids ) and 42 mol % cholesterol ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Liposomes were synthesized by forming lipid cakes by removing chloroform under vacuum for > 30 min followed by 2 h on a 4 . 5 L , - 105 ℃ lyophilizer ( Labconco ) . Lipids were reconstituted in PBS and sonicated for 20 minutes . Liposomes were systematically sized to by extruding through a 100 nm membrane for 15 - 20 passes ( Nuclepore Track - Etch Membrane , Cytiva ) . For flow cytometry studies , the lipid formulations were synthesized to include 0 . 1 mol % of either Vybrant DiI or DiO ( Invitrogen ) , a highly lipophilic dye . Peptide Decorated Liposome Preparation 300 peptide - lipid conjugates were added for one liposomal vesicle and incubated overnight at 4 ℃ . Dynamic Light Scattering ( DLS ) was performed on liposomes with a Zetasizer S ( Malvern Instruments ) . LNP Uptake of Cancerous Lung Epithelium Cells Lung Epithelium cell line A549 were incubated with 0 . 15 nM Chondroitin sulphate A , Chondroitin sulphate C and Heparan sulphate decorated and non - decorated liposomes for 4 hours in DMEM . The incubation was initiated after reaching monolayer confluency of cells on their substrates . Uptake efficiency was observed for soft , stiff matrices in both static and dynamic conditions and compared with plastic control . Flow Cytometry of LNP uptake To quantify the accumulation of the peptide decorated liposomes inside the cells , flow cytometry was performed after 4 - hour incubation of the cells with liposomes . Cells were collected by trypsonization after 4 hours , rinsed 3 times with 1x Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline ( DPBS ) ( Formulation : 200mg / L KCl and KH 2 PO 4 , 8000mg / L NaCl , 2160mg / L Na 2 HPO 4 * 7H 2 O , pH 7 - 7 . 6 , ) ( BioWhittaker , Lonza ) fixed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde solution prior to running in flow cytometer ( Guava easyCyte 6HT , Luminex ) . The fixing solution was prepared by mixing 10 % formaldehyde ( 36 . 5 - 38 % Formaldehyde solution in H 2 O , Sigma ) and 89 % DPBS . 1 % 1 . 5M NaCl solution prepared with Sodium Chloride crystals ( Fisher Bioreagents ) in H 2 O was added to balance the pH level of the solution . Statistical Analysis All statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad PRISM 9 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . All data sets were assessed with Welch’s t - test ( Figure S1a , c ) , one - way ANOVA followed by a Tukey HSD post hoc analysis ( Figures 2 , 4a , and S1b , c ) or a two - way ANOVA followed by a Tukey HSD post hoc analysis ( Figure 4b , c ) .
