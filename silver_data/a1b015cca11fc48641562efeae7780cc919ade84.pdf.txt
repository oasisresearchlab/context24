These studies , however , have not generally analyzed how external events are asso - ciated with a social network’s structure and communicative properties . Here , we study how external events are associ - ated with a network’s change in structure and communica - tions . Analyzing a complete dataset of millions of instant messages among the decision - makers in a large hedge fund and their network of outside contacts , we investigate the link between price shocks , network structure , and change in the aﬀect and cognition of decision - makers embedded in the network . When price shocks occur the communication network tends not to display structural changes associated with adaptiveness . Rather , the network “turtles up” . It displays a propensity for higher clustering , strong tie inter - action , and an intensiﬁcation of insider vs . outsider commu - nication . Further , we ﬁnd changes in network structure pre - dict shifts in cognitive and aﬀective processes , execution of new transactions , and local optimality of transactions better than prices , revealing the important predictive relationship between network structure and collective behavior within a social network .

INTRODUCTION The emergence of detailed , time - resolved data on large so - cial networks makes it possible to study their structure and dynamics in new ways . Work has identiﬁed stable network structures , communities , inﬂuentials in networks , informa - tion ﬂows , networked teams [ 1 – 5 ] , and the temporal evolu - tion of large social networks [ 6 – 16 ] .

Little research thus far has examined how social networks operate in a reactive capacity , as they respond to such stimuli from their broader environments . By external shocks we mean events that are extreme relative to aver - age events , or unexpected [ 17 ] . Such questions are critical to understanding a social network’s capacity to respond to uncertainty when the membership of the network remains essentially ﬁxed . The real - life conditions reﬂecting these dynamics are varied , including the response of intelligence and law enforcement personnel to emergency situations such as terrorist attacks [ 18 ] , health professionals responding to outbreaks [ 19 ] , or organizations facing sudden competitive threats or “normal accidents” [ 20 ] . The eﬀect has been to leave a set of basic questions largely unanswered . How does a network respond to external shocks ? What can shock - related responses reveal about adaptive collective behavior ? Current frameworks suggest diﬀerent conjectures for relating social network structure to external risks . Networks could open up structurally , with actors tapping acquaintances who are most likely to provide novel information and diverse per - spectives on problem - solving [ 21 ] . Experiments show that persons facing threatening job changes , for example , dispro - portionately turn to their weak ties and reduced their triadic closure [ 22 , 23 ] , broadening their options and access to novel job information [ 24 ] . Conversely , external shocks could be associated with networks “turtling up , ” with actors relying on well - worn sources of information , network insiders , and highly clustered relationships [ 25 , 26 ] that promote trustwor - thiness but narrow social cognition [ 22 , 24 , 25 , 27 ] . Further , little is known about how individual cognitive and aﬀective reactions aggregate in a network and whether collective re - actions are better predicted by knowledge of the shock or structural changes in the network [ 18 ] . We address these questions in the context of an organiza - tion’s social network [ 28 – 34 ] . We consider the complete instant - messaging corpus , including content , among the decision - makers of a hedge fund and their outside contacts . The anal - ysis of ﬁnancial investment behavior is of interest because of its criticality to the economy and society [ 35 – 40 ] . We focus on a few central questions . First , we study the link between environmental changes — encoded in the move - 9 ment of the prices of speciﬁc stocks at particular points in time — and changes in the network structure , speciﬁcally the subgraph consisting of instant messages about these particular stocks during the times in question . For ﬁnan - cial services ﬁrms , price shocks can represent threatening and stressful external stimuli . Experiments measuring the stress level of traders using conductance technology show that price changes lead to involuntary and signiﬁcant phys - iological changes indicative of stress . Shifts in prices cause traders to have increased heart rates and electrodermal re - sponses relative to control conditions [ 36 ] . Qualitative obser - vations of traders echo experimental results . In the industry , the VIX , a widely used measure of market price volatility , is referred to as the “Fear Index [ 41 ] . ” Following sociological theory , one expectation for the associ - ation between price shocks and network change is that price shocks are associated with a propensity to activate connec - tions that improve access to novel information and manage risk . In this case , it would be expected that actors in the network would rely relatively more on weak ties , network outsiders , and relationships with low closure . Conversely , shocks may be associated with reﬂective network structure and behavior [ 42 ] . Following this view , expectations are that actors disproportionately favor contacts repeatedly seen in the past , in - group rather than out - group relations , and highly interconnected contacts . In the face of shocks , our analysis supports the conclusion that networks “turtle up” structurally , exhibiting high levels of clustering , out - group communication , and strong ties . Where our ﬁrst question explores the link between exter - nal factors and network structure , our second main question asks whether these changes to the network structure can yield additional insight into the behavior of the organiza - tion — beyond what is provided by the external changes themselves . Speciﬁcally , if we seek to predict how the orga - nization will respond to a price change , does knowing prop - erties of the network structure improve the performance of the prediction even if we already have access to the time series of stock prices ? We show that knowledge of the network provides strong improvements in prediction of collective behavior for both individual - level actions and ﬁrm - level actions . We evalu - ate individual - level actions by analyzing the way traders ex - press themselves in the collection of instant messages , using a standard set of linguistic measures . These measures show that when a stock’s price changes signiﬁcantly ( in either the positive or negative direction ) , the messages associated with that stock display increased emotion and cognitive complex - ity . While these changes can already be inferred to a lim - ited extent from the price changes alone , we are able to predict their direction and magnitude much more eﬀectively when we incorporate network - level features into the predic - tion . We ﬁnd analogous eﬀects in the context of ﬁrm - level actions , where we analyze the trading decision employees make for the ﬁrm . We introduce a simple measure of lo - cal optimality in the trading price and show that network features provide signiﬁcantly improved performance in pre - dicting whether the ﬁrm will perform a locally optimal ac - tion . We ﬁnd a similar pattern when we attempt to predict whether trades that have not been observed for a number of days are suddenly traded . Taken together , our ﬁndings suggest a key role for electronic communication networks in the analysis of external shocks and events aﬀecting an organization : the network displays a consistent set of changes in response to these external events , emphasizing strong ties and clustered structures ; and knowl - edge of the network structure provides signiﬁcant leverage in predicting the organization’s collective behavior . 2 . DATA Our data include the complete instant - messaging communi - cation history among the personnel at a hedge fund , 2010 - 2011 . The data consist of approximately 22 million instant messages ( IMs ) sent by 8 , 646 people , of whom 184 are em - ployees of the hedge fund , and the rest are outside contacts . We use the full content of each message and unique person and time of transmission identiﬁers to analyze the IMs . We know each trade completed at the ﬁrm , the stock symbol involved , and date and time of execution . All transactions in our data were executed by the fund’s employees , not algo - rithms . On average , 559 transactions were performed daily . We merged the above data with public data on daily stock prices . All of our data analysis was consistent with guide - lines from the relevant Institutional Review Board 3 . MEASURES 3 . 1 Network IMs deﬁne a network of information exchange where nodes are communicating actors and IMs between actors deﬁne edges . Our primary interest is in the subgraphs of the larger network designated by mentions of particular stocks at par - ticular points in time . For a stock symbol s and a day d , we deﬁne an undirected graph G s , d as follows : for each IM between company insiders that mentions stock symbol s on day d , we include the two participants of the IM as nodes in G s , d , and we join them by an edge . We eliminate paral - lel edges , so that two nodes in G s , d will have at most one edge between them . Multiple messages between pairs were examined when relevant . G s , d thus consists of all employees who mentioned stock s on day d , with messages containing s on day d forming the edges between these people . We deﬁne an edge to be internal if both nodes are com - pany insiders and border if one node is a company outsider . All IMs include one company employee because communi - cation between company outsiders cannot be recorded . Our deﬁnition of G s , d uses only internal edges ; the analogous construction using both internal and border edges results in a larger graph G + s , d that contains G s , d . The notation and terminology used in the analysis for graph size and connectivity and quantiﬁcations of turtled up or open networks is as follows . Let N s , d and E s , d be the num - ber of nodes and edges respectively in G s , d . We normalize relevant measures in relation to comparable quantities in the data ; in particular , for a function f ( G s , d ) that we compute on G s , d , we will deﬁne ν ( f ( G s , d ) ) to be the ratio of f ( G s , d ) to the average value of f ( G s (cid:48) , d (cid:48) ) for all pairs ( s (cid:48) , d (cid:48) ) such that N s (cid:48) , d (cid:48) = N s , d and d (cid:48) < d . This lets us discuss whether f ( G s , d ) is large or small relative to other graphs from previ - ous days with the same number of nodes . We can deﬁne the 10 Table 1 : Results form OLS regressions of the form f ( G s , d ) = β 0 | ∆ s , d | + β 1 f ( G s , d − 1 ) + β 2 f ( G s , d − 2 ) + β 3 V IX + r s , d . Regressions include ﬁxed eﬀects at the stock and day of the week level . Each column represents a regression with f as the dependent variable and the rows show the value and signiﬁcance of the independent variable .

Turtled up networks exhibit a propensity towards strong ties over weak ties , high clustering , and insider vs . outsider links . Networks tend to turtle up on days with large or unexpected stock price changes . analogous normalization based on the number of edges ; we write (cid:15) ( f ( G s , d ) ) to denote the ratio of f ( G s , d ) to the average value of f ( G s (cid:48) , d (cid:48) ) for all pairs ( s (cid:48) , d (cid:48) ) such that E s (cid:48) , d (cid:48) = E s , d and d (cid:48) < d . Furthermore , since some stocks tend to be more popular in traders’ conversations than others , we normalize the number of nodes . We deﬁne ¯ N s , d as the ratio of N s , d to the average values of N s , d (cid:48) for all d (cid:48) < d . Beyond the number of nodes and edges , a basic quantity is connectivity — whether G s , d is connected or whether most nodes belong to few connected components . We write L s , d for the fraction of nodes in the largest connected component of G s , d , and K s , d for the minimum number of components required to account for at least 90 % of nodes in G s , d . Sociological theory distinguishes“closed”network structures as containing many triangles of relationships ( friends of friends link to each other ) and a high proportion of strong ties ( high - frequency relationships ) . We are referring to networks with this structure as turtled up networks . Open network struc - tures contain few triangles of relationships and have rela - tively high numbers of weak ties . Figure 1 illustrates key diﬀerences between closed or turtled up networks and open networks . A measure for capturing triangles of relationship is the clus - tering coeﬃcient ; formally the fraction of pairs of a node’s neighbors that are connected by an edge . We deﬁne C s , d as the average clustering coeﬃcient over all nodes in G s , d . To capture strength of ties we use frequency of communication , which is a relevant measure for the structure of a social net - work [ 43 ] . For each node x in G s , d , we consider the set of all nodes y with whom x has participated in any messages on days d (cid:48) < d , and we sort these nodes y in descending order by the number of such messages they have participated in x . We deﬁne U x , d , α as the highest α fraction of this sorted list : the α fraction of x ’s communication partners from the prior day d , measured by communication volume these are x ’s strongest edges . We quantify whether G s , d favors strong or weak ties using the measure S s , d , α , the fraction of edges ( x , y ) for which y ∈ U x , d , α . To the extent that closed and open structures are related to an actor’s reach for informa - tion across boundaries [ 21 ] , we deﬁne the openness O s , d as the fraction of edges in G + s , d that are border edges . 3 . 2 Shocks To deﬁne the extremeness and unexpectedness of price shocks , we deﬁned for each stock s and day d , a s , d and b s , d to be the opening and closing prices respectively of stock s on day d . We deﬁne ∆ s , d = b s , d − a s , d a s , d as the proportional change in the price of s on day d . Some price changes are disruptive — the price change mag - nitudes are greater than recent changes , and therefore they can be characterized as unexpected . They intuitively cor - respond to shocks [ 17 ] . We operationalize the notion of a “shock” as follows : a stock - day pair ( s , d ) is an x - shock if | ∆ s , d | > x and | ∆ s , d (cid:48) | ≤ x for d (cid:48) = d − 3 , d − 2 , d − 1 . That is , ( s , d ) is an x - shock if stock s ’s price change on day d was higher than x , and its price change was lower than x on the previous three days . We investigate how continuous values of ∆ s , d and discrete x - shocks relate to the properties of G d , s . 4 . FINDINGS 4 . 1 Price Changes and Network Dynamics We observe a substantial relationship between changes in stock price and changes in network structure . Figure 2 shows how each network feature – clustering , tie strength , and the 11 Table 2 : Results form OLS regressions of the form f ( G s , d ) = β 0 | ∆ s , d | + β 1 f ( G s , d − 1 ) + β 2 f ( G s , d − 2 ) + β 3 V IX + r s , d .

When ∆ = 0 , the vertical axis indicates the mean measure for all networks . Through - out the paper , ﬁgures also include 95 % conﬁdence intervals . Throughout the paper , ﬁgures also include 95 % conﬁdence intervals . Aggregating changes in network properties with respect to price changes over all stocks and days , we observe that as price changes increase in intensity , the network ex - hibits a higher clustering coeﬃcient 1 . Price changes are also related to increasing levels of tie strength 2 . These ﬁndings reveal that decision - makers in the network tend to turtle up their communication in the face of stress , rather than open up . Changes in connectivity are also signiﬁcant but substan - tively slight . The fraction of nodes in the largest component increases slightly and the number of components needed to account for 90 % of the nodes decreases slightly with price changes . We also ﬁnd a trend with respect to network size — as the price changes increase , the number of nodes ( ¯ N s , d ) and edges increases ( ν ( E s , d ) ) . These eﬀects are reported for graphs G s , d with at least two nodes ; all results are consistent if we restrict to graphs containing a larger number of nodes . We note that changes in network structure are symmetric with respect to the direction of the price change , which is curious in nature given that one might expect that price increases and decreases would be associated with diﬀerent structural changes — an issue we address below when we examine the actual changes in actors’ cognition and aﬀect . We further examined the results in Figure 2 by disaggre - gating the analysis on a stock - by - stock and industry - by - industry basis subject to control variables . We run OLS regressions of the form f ( G s , d ) = β 0 | ∆ s , d | + β 1 f ( G s , d − 1 ) + β 2 f ( G s , d − 2 ) + β 3 V IX + α 1 D 1 s + · · · + α S D Ss + r s , d , where S is the number of stocks in our data set . For each stock s (cid:48) the indicator function D s (cid:48) s is deﬁned as follows as follows : 1 We observe consistent results when we measure clustering while controlling for nodes ( ν ( C s , d ) ) and edges ( (cid:15) ( C s , d ) ) . 2 In Figure 2 ( b ) , we use α = 0 . 1 as the threshold for tie strength . Border edges also drop as a percentage of edges in the face of price changes . Repeating the test with various values of α showed that the results are similar regardless of the choice of α D s (cid:48) s : = (cid:26) 1 : s = s (cid:48) 0 : s (cid:54) = s (cid:48) Including this indicator function as an independent variable measures the association between the change in stock prices , | ∆ s , d | and the network properties f ( G s , d ) on a stock - by - stock basis ( i . e . , ﬁxed eﬀects model [ 44 ] ) . We included ﬁxed eﬀect variables for day of the week to control communication patterns explained by the day of the week ( e . g . , earning announcements and quarterly reports typically are made on speciﬁc days for speciﬁc stocks ) ; a variable measuring the daily market wide volatility using the VIX index ; and the lagged values f ( G s , d − 1 ) and f ( G s , d − 2 ) to control for possible autocorrelation in the time series of network properties . We run regressions with the described stock level ﬁxed ef - fects and an additional version where we use a ﬁxed eﬀects model at the industry level instead of the stock level . Tables 1 and 2 show the value and signiﬁcance of each independent variable using ﬁxed eﬀects at the stock and industry level , respectively . The results conﬁrm the analyses presented in Figure 2 . Changes in price are associated with increases in network size , clustering , and strength of ties , and de - creases in the percentage of outside contacts . A post - test analysis for autocorrelation of the residuals was also run . For each stock s , we ran a separate regression of the form f ( G s , d ) = β 0 | ∆ s , d | + β 1 f ( G s , d − 1 ) + β 2 f ( G s , d − 2 ) + r s , d . Based on the Durbin - Watson test [ 45 ] there was no statistical evi - dence of positive or negative serial correlation in 99 . 2 % and 99 . 9 % of the stocks , respectively . The relationship between unexpected price changes and net - work structure further substantiate the inference that social networks in the face of uncertainty , as measured here , ex - hibit a propensity to turtle up . We compare the value of each feature of G s , d when ( s , d ) is an x - shock and when it is not . Further , we measure the number of days a graph feature takes to return to its mean value following a shock . Figure 3 shows the values of network features in graphs G s , d on the day of an x - shock ( x = 5 % , as deﬁned above ) , and then on subsequent days until the feature approximately returns to its average over all networks . The insets in Figure 3 compare network values on shock and non - shock days . We ﬁnd that all features are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent when there are shocks , and the direction of the diﬀerences mirror the previous Fig - ure 2 . The same patterns arise when diﬀerent values of x 12 − 10 − 5 0 5 10 Change in stock price ( % ) 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 4 . 5 5 . 0 C l u s t e r i ng c oe ff .

Our analysis of network recovery indicates that most network properties return to their average value one or two days after the shock , suggesting that normalization in relation to these shocks is relatively fast acting . These results suggest that social networks in the face of stress broadly exhibit features associated with turtling up rather than opening up . Social networks become more in - tensely interconnected among third parties , rely more on information from strong rather than weak ties , and dispro - portionately attend to organizational insiders . 4 . 2 Cognitive and Affective Content To further understand the behavioral ramiﬁcations of net - work structure in the face of shocks , we explored the links between changes in network structure and the psychology of the actors in the network . If changes in network struc - ture are associated with actual changes in behavior , changes in network structure should predict changes in actors’ cog - nition and aﬀect . Cognition and aﬀect are important psy - chological conditions , shaping information processing and decision - making [ 46 – 48 ] . To infer aﬀect and cognition of the actors in our network , we use the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ( LIWC ) dic - tionary , which identiﬁes words in the content of commu - nications ( i . e . , instant messages ) that reﬂect aﬀective and cognitive states 3 . Aﬀect includes positive emotion , negative emotion , anxiety , anger , and sadness . Cognition includes insight , causation , discrepancy , tentative , certainty , inhibi - tion , inclusive , and exclusive . the LIWC dictionary is well - validated and regularly used [ 49 , 50 ] . Before incorporating the role of network features , we inves - tigate the relationship between stock prices and IM content by measuring how the usage of LIWC categories varies with changes in the stock prices . In particular , research holds that price changes are stressful for the employees of the ﬁrm from a cognitive and emotional perspective [ 36 ] . For each in - stant message among insiders , we computed the percentage 3 See http : / / www . liwc . net for more information on LIWC 2007 of words in each LIWC category . Formally , given a stock - day pair ( s , d ) and the IMs that mention s on day d , we test whether the percentage of LIWC words in the IMs varies with ∆ s , d . The x - axis in Figures 4 and 5 show the relative price change ∆ . When ∆ > 0 ( ∆ < 0 ) and the y - axis indicates the mean percentage of words in each LIWC cat - egory in IMs mentioning s on day d such that ∆ s , d ≥ ∆ ( ∆ s , d ≤ ∆ ) . When ∆ = 0 , the y - axis indicates the mean value for all IMs . We ﬁnd that price changes are associated with expected changes in cognition and aﬀect . Figures 4 ( f ) shows that as price changes intensify , either upward or downward , decision - makers’ communications express higher levels of cognitive processes — presumably because they face greater risk and complexity in their judgments . Figures 4 ( b - i ) show how the diﬀerent subcategories of cognitive processes change with price . The general trend is that the change in cognitive pro - cesses is symmetric in the direction of the price change . This symmetric pattern is consistent with the structural changes in Figure 2 . By contrast , aﬀect expressed during ups and downs in price are asymmetric . Figure 5 ( a ) shows that expressed aﬀect surrounding a stock during its price changes diﬀer depending on whether prices rise or fall . Figures 5 ( b - f ) show the change in the aﬀective subcategories with changes in prices . Words related to positive emotions are used more when stock prices rise while words related to negative emotions , anger , anxiety , and sadness are used more often when stock prices drop . One explanation of this is that while funds can make as much money when stock prices fall as when they rise by selling short , more negative aﬀect is expected when prices drop because falling prices generally sound alarms among retail investors who put their capital in the hands of hedge fund decision - makers and take money out of the market when stock prices fall . If message content varies with price changes , does network structure further predict the psychology of traders ? To address this question , we formulate the following predic - tion task . For each stock s and each LIWC category C , let 13 Shock 1 2 Days after shock 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 C l u s t e r i ng c oe ff . | N u m .

For each day d , let C s , d be the fraction of all IMs containing stock symbol s on day d that include a word from category C . We say that the pair ( s , d ) conforms to category C if C s , d > C s — in other words , if words from category C are used at a higher rate on day d than is typical for stock s . We use binary classiﬁers to predict whether each pair ( s , d ) conforms to each of the cognitive and emotional LIWC cat - egories using the properties of the network and the stock price changes as predictors . We run the prediction test us - ing three feature sets : only network change features ( prop - erties of G s , d described in section 3 . 1 ) , only price change features ( ∆ s , d and | ∆ s , d | ) , and the two sets of features to - gether . Each set of features includes lagged values for 7 days before day d . To test the accuracy of the classiﬁers , we split time into 100 - day bins , using each bin as a test set and all the previous bins as training data . We balance the testing and training data by including all positive examples and se - lecting a random sample of negative examples of the same size as the set of control cases . Table 3 shows the number of cases in each class before being balanced . We use seven bi - nary classiﬁers : Random Forest , Linear Discriminant Analy - sis , Quadratic Discriminant Analysis , Naive Bayes , Decision Trees , Support Vector Machines , and Logistic Regression . Choice of classiﬁer does not change the results ; logistic re - gression results are presented . Figure 6 shows the accuracy of the logistic regression clas - siﬁer using each of the feature sets for the aﬀective and cognitive categories , and for the positive - emotion , negative - emotion , and insight subcategories . Network properties alone provide signiﬁcantly better predictions of the psychology of the decision - makers than the price changes alone . Further - more , the ﬁgure indicates that combining the two types of features does not yield a signiﬁcant improvement over the network features alone . This pattern suggests that network structure is more predictive of a network’s collective aﬀect and cognition than the price shock itself .

Since trading requires coordination and communication among the employees , it is likely that some of the high level trading decisions of the ﬁrm are latent in the structure of the ﬁrm’s communication . We look at two important aspects of the decision making process when the ﬁrm decides to make a trade – the quality of its trading decision in terms of timing , and the decision to begin trading a stock that has not been traded for a long period of time . Stock prices are crucial in both trading time and in deciding to trade a new stock , hence when we test the predictive value of the networks , we always compare it against the stocks’ price changes . We ﬁnd that the network structure is indeed predictive of these trading behaviors , above and beyond what is predicted by price changes alone . 4 . 3 . 1 Predicting Performance . 14 − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 070 0 . 072 0 . 074 0 . 076 0 . 078 0 . 080 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( a ) Cognitive processes − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 0065 0 . 0070 0 . 0075 0 . 0080 0 . 0085 0 . 0090 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( b ) Insight − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 0055 0 . 0060 0 . 0065 0 . 0070 0 . 0075 0 . 0080 0 . 0085 0 . 0090 0 . 0095 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( c ) Causation − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 0034 0 . 0036 0 . 0038 0 . 0040 0 . 0042 0 . 0044 0 . 0046 0 . 0048 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( d ) Certainty − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 0060 0 . 0065 0 . 0070 0 . 0075 0 . 0080 0 . 0085 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( e ) Discrepancy − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 0115 0 . 0120 0 . 0125 0 . 0130 0 . 0135 0 . 0140 0 . 0145 0 . 0150 0 . 0155 0 . 0160 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( f ) Exclusive − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 018 0 . 019 0 . 020 0 . 021 0 . 022 0 . 023 0 . 024 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( g ) Inclusive − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 0014 0 . 0016 0 . 0018 0 . 0020 0 . 0022 0 . 0024 0 . 0026 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( h ) Inhibition − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 014 0 . 015 0 . 016 0 . 017 0 . 018 0 . 019 0 . 020 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( i ) Tentative Figure 4 : Price changes vs . percentage change in words reﬂecting various cognitive processes . 15 − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Change in stock price ( % ) 0 . 014 0 . 015 0 . 016 0 . 017 0 . 018 0 . 019 P e r c en t age o f w o r d s ( a ) Aﬀective processes − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Changeinstockprice ( % ) 0 . 002 0 . 003 0 . 004 0 . 005 0 . 006 0 . 007 0 . 008 0 . 009 P e r c en t ageo f w o r d s ( b ) Negative emotion − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Changeinstockprice ( % ) 0 . 008 0 . 009 0 . 010 0 . 011 0 . 012 0 . 013 0 . 014 P e r c en t ageo f w o r d s ( c ) Positive emotion − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Changeinstockprice ( % ) 0 . 0005 0 . 0010 0 . 0015 0 . 0020 0 . 0025 P e r c en t ageo f w o r d s ( d ) Anger − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Changeinstockprice ( % ) 0 . 0001 0 . 0002 0 . 0003 0 . 0004 0 . 0005 0 . 0006 0 . 0007 0 . 0008 0 . 0009 P e r c en t ageo f w o r d s ( e ) Anxiety − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 0 2 4 6 8 Changeinstockprice ( % ) 0 . 0005 0 . 0010 0 . 0015 0 . 0020 0 . 0025 0 . 0030 0 . 0035 0 . 0040 P e r c en t ageo f w o r d s ( f ) Sadness Figure 5 : Price changes vs . percentage change in words reﬂecting various aﬀective processes A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O 0 . 50 0 . 55 0 . 60 0 . 65 0 . 70 A cc u r a cy Combined Network Price changes Figure 6 : Prediction accuracy of logistic regression classiﬁer for LIWC categories using network fea - tures , price change features , and all features com - bined .

We begin by measuring whether the timing of each trade was locally optimal . To measure local optimality of each transaction , we ask whether the ﬁrm would have beneﬁted from waiting until the next day to make the transaction . For a stock s traded on day d we let p s , d denote the price of the stock for that transaction . We let p maxs , d and p mins , d be the maximum and minimum price of stock s on day d . If a stock s was bought on day d at price p s , d and the maximum price of s the following day ( p maxs , d + 1 ) was less less than p s , d , then the company would have beneﬁted from waiting until the next day to buy stock s . Following this reasoning , we label each buy transaction ( s , d , p s , d ) as locally suboptimal if p s , d > p maxs , d + 1 and locally optimal otherwise . Similarly , we label each sell transaction ( s , d , p s , d ) as locally suboptimal if p s , d > p min s , d + 1 and locally optimal otherwise . We observe that about 20 % and 23 % of all buy and sell transaction are locally suboptimal . We expect that the decision process of the ﬁrm does not always involve optimizing exactly the day on which to make a transaction . Instead , the ﬁrm may focus most of its eﬀorts on other objectives — trying to decide which stocks to trade , how much to trade , or on long term proﬁt as opposed to small gains . To validate our measure of local optimality , we test whether the company’s trades reﬂect an eﬀort to trade on a locally optimal day by comparing the ﬁrm’s real performance with their performance if the trades occurred on a random day . We create a random set of transactions by taking each trans - action in the data set and generating an alternative transac - 16 tion of the same stock and same number of shares , but on a randomly selected day . The price of the alternative transac - tion is selected uniformly at random between the minimum and maximum price on the selected day . The number of locally suboptimal transactions in the ran - dom set is 2 % higher than in the actual set of transactions . While 2 % may not initially appear to be very large , it is eas - ier to assess the size of the diﬀerence when we compute the loss in proﬁt that these locally suboptimal transaction gen - erate . For each locally suboptimal transaction ( s , d , p s , d ) , we let the number of shares traded be V s , d , p . The loss generated by this transaction is V s , d , p ∗ | p s , d − p s , d + 1 | . The diﬀerence in total loss generated by the set of actual transactions and the set of random transaction is about $ 40 million . This shows that the company performs much better than they would if they traded the same stock and the same number of shares , but on a randomly selected day . This validates our measure ; we now test if it is related to features of the networks . We use our set of classiﬁers to predict whether transactions are locally optimal using the properties of the network and the stock price changes as predictors . For each transaction t s , d of stock s on day d , we use the features of the graph G s , d , the chance in price ∆ p s , d , and the absolute change in price | ∆ p s , d | to predict whether t s , d is locally optimal . As we did before , we split time into 100 bins , and use each bin as a test set and all the previous bins as training data . We also use a balanced set of positive and negative exam - ples . Since some stocks are traded very often and others are rarely traded , we further split the prediction task into subtasks by the number of consecutive days on which trans - actions occurred . Letting T k be the set of transactions that have occurred on at least the previous k days , we run the classiﬁers on each set of transactions T k for k = 0 . . . 6 . Figure 7 shows the accuracy of the Logistic Regression clas - siﬁer for each set of transactions T k . The accuracy of the classiﬁers increases with the number of days of consecutive transitions , suggesting the local optimality of routine trans - actions is easier to predict than that of unexpected transac - tions . We also observe that the network features are signiﬁ - cantly more predictive than the price changes . Furthermore , combining the network and price change features does not signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of the classiﬁer with net - work features alone . This shows that the local optimality of the ﬁrm’s decisions are better aligned with the properties of their communication than the changes in stock prices . 4 . 3 . 2 Predicting Sudden Trading We observed that it’s easier to predict the local optimality of stocks that are traded consecutively . We now turn to a second , more basic question to study the ﬁrm - level actions with respect to trading : are we able to predict whether or not a stock is traded on a given day ? Our ﬁrst observation is that many stocks are traded at very high frequencies , and hence the best predictor of a stock being traded on given day is whether it was traded during the previous few days . Given this , we pose the task of predicting new transactions – trades of stocks that have not been traded for a given number of days prior to the transaction being considered . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Minimum number of days of consecutive transactions 0 . 50 0 . 52 0 . 54 0 . 56 0 . 58 0 . 60 A cc u r a cy Combined Network Price changes Figure 7 : Prediction accuracy of logistic regression classiﬁer when predicting if a trade is locally opti - mal vs . the number of consecutive days the stock was traded . The curves show the results using net - work features , price change features , and all features combined . We let NT dk be the set stocks that have not been traded for k weeks prior to day d . We say that a stock s is k - unobserved on day d if it is in the set NT dk . That is , s is k - unobserved on day d if it has not been traded during the past k weeks preceding d . Note that a k - unobserved stock on day d is also k (cid:48) - unobserved on day d for all k (cid:48) < k . We say that all stocks are 0 - unobserved on all days . We use our binary classiﬁers to predict whether stocks that are k - unobserved on day d will be traded on day d . The setup of the prediction task is the same as in the last two sections – we split time into 100 bins and use each bin as a test set and all the previous bins as training data , and we use a balanced set of positive and negative examples . We use network and price change features as we did in previous sections , but in this case we also include features that indi - cate whether the stock was traded on the 7 days prior to the k - week period when the stock was not traded . For example , when we predict if a 1 - unobserved stock s is traded on day d , we know s was not traded on days d − 1 , . . . d − 7 , but we include features that indicate if s was traded on days d − 8 , d − 9 , . . . d − 14 . Figure 8 shows the accuracy of the classiﬁers for diﬀerent values of k . When k = 0 we are predicting whether stocks are traded on day d , regardless of whether they have been traded on the previous days . We observe that with no min - imum window on the time since the last trade , the 7 - day trading history of the stocks provides over 80 % accuracy , and adding information about the network or stock prices does not signiﬁcantly increase the accuracy . However , as k increases and we begin predicting trading of stocks that have not been traded for some time , the accuracy of the stocks’ trading history alone drops signiﬁcantly . When we add the price change features to the trading history fea - 17 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Number of weeks without trade ( k ) 0 . 50 0 . 55 0 . 60 0 . 65 0 . 70 0 . 75 0 . 80 A cc u r a cy All features combined Previous Trades and Network Previous Trades and Prices Previous Trades Figure 8 : Prediction accuracy of logistic regression classiﬁer when predicting if k - unobserved stocks are traded vs . k . The curves show the results using net - work features , price change features , and all features combined . tures , we do not observe a signiﬁcant increase in accuracy . However , adding the network features to the trading history features yields a large increase increase in accuracy . For ex - ample , for k = 4 , . . . , 9 the accuracy of the price change and trading history features is less than 55 % and that of the network and trading history features is over % 68 . Finally , adding price change features to the network and trading his - tory does not signiﬁcantly increase accuracy . This pattern is consistent with what we found when predicting aﬀective and cognitive content and trading performance . 5 . CONCLUSION Network science has examined the reaction of networks to internal stresses , particularly nodal loss , but has given con - siderably less attention to the relationship between external shocks in a network of stable members [ 51 ] . Using all the instant messages among stock traders in an investing orga - nization and their outside contacts to deﬁne structural , cog - nitive , and aﬀective properties of their social network , we found that shocks — in the form of extreme price changes — were not associated with conventional adaptive network responses to uncertainty . Rather , the network turtled up . Relationships within the network favored strong ties , high clustering , and company insiders . Implications of this work relate to networks facing disruptive environments and “normal accidents” [ 20 ] . One often cited beneﬁt of networks is that they are more agile than hierar - chies and more coordinated than markets in solving collec - tive action problems [ 34 , 52 ] . While one basis for this beneﬁt has been to show that institutions organized as networks do better than hierarchies in turbulent environments , there has been little work on the actual network dynamics that arise in organizations facing environmental disruptions . Indeed , the 2013 DARPA “robolympics” challenge was instituted to investigate whether machines can work hand in hand with humans to address problems of organizing in the face of“nor - mal accidents” better than humans can on their own . Our case indicated that networks facing shocks turtle up rather than open up . Nevertheless , we ﬁnd that networks are rel - atively elastic — turtled up states return to normal states relatively fast . Whether the combination of these changes leads to better or worse performance relative to a set cri - terion beyond the metrics we investigated , and provided by theory , is a logical research extension and a broad goal for improving knowledge about the scientiﬁc functionality and practical management of social networks . Moreover , we ﬁnd that the network structure is diagnostic of important patterns of behavior — including the emotional and cognitive content of individual communications , local optimality of transactions , and the sudden execution of new transactions . It is noteworthy that the structure of the net - works is more eﬀective at predicting these behavioral pat - terns than the price changes in the market . This suggests that the network - level changes we observe are not simple oﬀshoots of the underlying price changes , but instead that they carry additional rich information that can be used to analyze the organization’s behavior . Understanding the net - work’s reaction to shocks can thus be an important factor in understanding the organization more broadly . The role of the network in this analysis raises a number of further open questions . In particular , while there is a clear relationship between changes in the market and changes in the network , it is interesting to consider what the lower - level mechanisms that produce these eﬀects might be . As we come to better understand the links between shocks , networks , and behavior , we can thus arrive at a clearer picture of net - works in the context of their surrounding environments . 6 .
