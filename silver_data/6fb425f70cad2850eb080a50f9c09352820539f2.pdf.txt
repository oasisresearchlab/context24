The inverse - BAR domain ( I - BAR ) is a BAR domain that forms a straight “zeppelin - shaped” dimer . The mechanisms by which IRSp53 I - BAR binds to and deforms a lipid membrane are investigated here by all - atom molecular dynamics simulation ( MD ) , binding energy analysis , and the effects of mutation experiments on filopodia on HeLa cells . I - BAR adopts a curved structure when crystallized , but adopts a flatter shape in MD . The binding of I - BAR to membrane was stabilized by ~ 30 salt bridges , consistent with experiments showing that point mutations of the interface residues have little effect on the binding affinity whereas multiple mutations have considerable effect . Salt bridge formation increases the local density of lipids and deforms the membrane into a concave shape . In addition , the point mutations that break key intra - molecular salt bridges within I - BAR reduce the binding affinity ; this was confirmed by expressing these mutants in HeLa cells and observing their effects . The results indicate that the stiffness of I - BAR is important for membrane deformation , although I - BAR does not act as a completely rigid template . Plasma membrane invaginations and protrusions are essential processes for endocytosis , cell migration , and other cellular dynamics . Bin Amphiphysin Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain superfamily proteins are often involved in such deformations of cellular membrane 1 . “Canonical” BAR domains 2 , hereafter called ‘BAR domain’ form a banana - shaped homodimer and interact with the membrane through their concave surfaces via charged amino acids . Extended Fes - CIP4 domain ( F - BAR ) 3 – 6 adopts a more elongated structure that induces the formation of thicker membrane tubules . BAR and F - BAR are believed to deform membranes by molding the membrane struc - ture to the BAR domain surface . Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) 7 – 11 is an adaptor protein comprising an N - terminal membrane binding domain , a CRIB motif that can bind to Cdc42 12 , 13 , and a Src homology 3 domain bound to several actin regulators 8 , 14 , 15 . This membrane - binding domain of IRSp53 is classified as an Inverse - BAR domain ( I - BAR ) , and found in five proteins in mammals , which are IRSp53 , IRTKS , pinkbar , MIM , and ABBA 8 , 16 . In contrast to other BAR domains , I - BAR forms a straight or “zeppelin - shaped” dimer and induces outward protrusions of the plasma membrane . Consistently , IRSp53 plays key roles in the for - mation of filopodia and lamellipodia 10 , which are related to several essential biological processes such as neurite extension 12 , dendric spine formation 17 – 20 , myogenic differentiation 21 , lens formation 22 , and tumor invasion 23 , 24 . The molecular mechanisms by which the BAR domain causes membrane deformation have been extensively studied computationally by molecular dynamics simulation ( MD ) of the BAR domain with N - terminal amphi - pathic helices ( N - BAR ) of amphiphysin 25 – 32 and endophilin 33 – 36 . In N - BAR , insertion of the helices into one side of the membrane is expected to curve the membrane into a convex shape . A single N - BAR domain deforms the membrane locally and multiple N - BAR domains are required to induce global membrane deformation , i . e . , tubulation and vesiculation ; Multi scale simulation results showed that membrane curvature depends on the concentration and arrangement of the N - BAR domains 27 , 29 , 31 . Mesoscopic simulations showed that N - BAR induces tubulation at low concentration and causes vesiculation at high density 26 , 30 . Especially , the arrangement of endophilin N - BAR was investigated using cryo - electronmicroscopy and coarse - grained MD simulation 35 , 36 .

Coarse - grained MD simulations also showed that N - BAR tends to assemble linearly when the surface tension is low , whereas high surface tension inhibits inter - actions between N - BAR domains and alters the geometry of N - BAR association 37 . Electron paramagnetic reso - nance with site - directed spin labelling studies suggested that vesicle binding of the N - BAR protein amphiphysin is mediated by shallow insertion of amphiphathic N - terminal helices whereas the interaction with tubes involves deeply inserted N - terminal helices with concave surface of the BAR domain 38 . All - atom MD indicated that F - BAR changes the curvature of the membrane via scaffolding mechanism even though F - BAR itself is flexible 39 . These results suggest that distinct BAR domains may use different binding and membrane bending mechanisms . The molecular mechanisms of I - BAR tubulation were investigated using point and multiple mutations of Lys and Arg residues for IRSp53 7 . Several Lys residues in each protomer are believed to form a “lipid binding line” , generating two binding lines in the domain . Only one lipid binding line likely binds to the membranes , given that the simultaneous binding of two lines may be structurally difficult if I - BAR is completely rigid 7 , 8 , 40 . Although I - BAR domains in different proteins including IRSp53 , pinkbar , and MIM are structurally similar 11 , 41 – 43 , they induce tubules with diameters 9 ranging from 40 to 60 nm , significantly smaller than the value ~ 95 nm estimated from the structure of I - BAR 40 . To explain the variations in the diameter , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was suggested to induce protein - dependent clustering and insertion of hydrophobic amino - acid residues for the I - BAR domain from MIM 9 , however such mechanisms appeared to be absent for I - BAR from IRSp53 to induce membrane deformation 7 . With an assay in which I - BAR domains were encapsulated in giant unilamellar vesicles connected to membrane nanotubes , it was shown that I - BAR senses negative curvature and is enriched at a curvature , 0 . 055 nm − 1 ( = 36 nm diameter ) , and has significant mechanical effects on curved membranes 44 . All - atom and coarse - grained molecular dynamics simulations suggested that I - BAR interacts and bends negatively charged phospholipids 45 . The molecular mechanisms by which I - BAR binds to and deforms a lipid membrane was investigated here using all - atom MD simulation , binding energy calculations and mutational effects on formation of filopodia on HeLa cells . Multiple MD simulations starting from distinct membrane - unbound states showed spontane - ous binding of an I - BAR domain dimer to the membrane and the induction of increased membrane curvature . Analysis of the binding energy indicated that salt - bridge formation between I - BAR and the lipid headgroups pro - vides the driving force to induce membrane deformation . Furthermore , the formation of salt bridges increases the local density of the lipids and deforms the membrane . In addition , the importance of intramolecular salt - bridges within I - BAR is shown by comparing the binding affinities of mutants and the effects of these mutations on filopodia observed in HeLa cells . Our findings indicate that I - BAR must exhibit some degree of stiffness in order to cause membrane deformation , although I - BAR is a quite flexible and does not act as a rigid template . Results Strong Directivity of I - BAR in the Binding to Membrane . The process by which I - BAR binds to a lipid bilayer membrane was observed using four MD simulations ( Referred as MD1 – 4 . Supplementary Movies 1 – 4 ) . Each simulation began with a distinct I - BAR initial positions , with an θ and inter - molecular center of mass dis - tance D Z along the membrane normal ( Z - axis ) ( Fig . 1 ) . D Z represents the actual distance and Δ D Z indicates the relative value from the completely bound state , which was defined as the global free energy minimum obtained by free energy calculation in MD1 ( see below ) ; those in MD2 , MD3 , and MD4 were defined as average D Z values Figure 1 .

The conditions used in I - BAR binding experiments to liposome 7 were replicated by constructing the simulated lipid bilayer membrane from dioleoyl - phosphatidylcholine DOPC and dioleoyl - phosphatidylethanolamine ( DOPE ) and dioleoyl - phosphatidylserine ( DOPS ) at a ratio of 4 : 4 : 1 . DOPC and DOPE are neutral phospholipids whereas DOPS is negatively charged . MD simulation of solutions containing I - BAR alone and membrane alone were also conducted . This lipid bilayer model does not include multivalent phosphoinositides . We used the lipid bilayer with DOPC / DOPE with monovalent negatively charged lipid ( DOPS ) as a minimal model , because I - BAR from IRSp53 was reported to function in the absence of the phosphoinositide and addition of phosphatidylinositol triphosphate ( PIP 3 ) did not further increased the I - BAR binding 7 . In the MD , there appeared to be no specific binding site of PS on the surface of the I - BAR domain , and therefore , it is suggested that phosphoinositide would also bind to the I - BAR domain mainly through electrostatic interaction without specific binding pockets . However , in the case of the I - BAR domain from MIM , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was suggested to play an important role in membrane deformation 9 , and therefore the effects of phosphoinositides on the I - BAR domains of IRSp53 and MIM will be examined in the future . I - BAR spontaneously made first contact with the membrane at 4 . 8 ( MD1 , contacting residue : K152 ) , 5 . 4 ( MD2 , D159 and Q163 ) , 1 . 8 ( MD3 , R114 ) and 1 . 7 ns ( MD4 , R114 ) ( Fig . 2a ) , but these first contacts were not always stable . Once more than ten residues were in contact with the lipids , the bindings became stable using residues at one end of the I - BAR homodimer ( Table S1 ) . K156 and K160 interacted with the lipids in all the sim - ulations at this stage . As the simulation progressed , more residues gradually interacted with the lipids until the entire I - BAR stably bound to the membrane . After 27 . 3 ( MD1 ) , 60 . 2 ( MD2 ) , and 36 . 4 ns ( MD4 ) ( Fig . 2b ) , I - BAR bound in almost the same orientation ( Fig . 2c ) and through essentially the same interface . Regardless of its initial orientations , I - BAR reoriented relatively quickly ( < 100 ns ) to the orientation consistently obtained by the end of the simulation , indicating that I - BAR is strongly directed to the membrane . Reorientations of I - BAR were also observed in coarse - grained MD simulations 45 . In this case , however , I - BAR bound to the membrane with the opposite orientation in which C - terminal residues directed toward the membrane as shown in “system 3” 45 . Since the C - terminal of the I - BAR is connected to other domains of IRSp53 , this binding orientation may be unreal - istic . The binding of both ends of I - BAR to the membrane drastically increased the curvature of the membrane ( Fig . 2d ) . In this study , the curvature is defined as being positive if the membrane is bent towards I - BAR . The curvature averaged over the I - BAR binding region of the membrane ( C ave ) was in the range 1 . 2 ~ 2 . 3 × 10 − 2 nm − 1 after 100 ns in MD1 , which is considerably higher than the curvature observed in membrane - only simulation ( See SI Text for the method for calculating C ave ) . Selected snapshots from MD1 and MD4 are shown in Fig . 2e , f . The I - BAR domain as a whole , and especially the tips around Gly150 ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) , is very flexible in solu - tion and in the unbound state , and is flatter than the structure observed crystallographyically 7 ( see later sections ) . Figure 2 .

The maximum and average curvatures , C max and C ave , and free energy , Δ G B , of I - BAR binding were calculated as a function of the center of mass distance Δ D Z between I - BAR and the membrane ( Fig . 3a , b ) . The origin of Δ D Z was set to the global free energy minimum , and the second minimum was positioned at Δ D Z = 3 . 5 Å . Δ G B is − 8 . 6 kcal / mol at Δ D Z = 0 , compared to a value at Δ D Z = 30 . 5 Å . The free energy differences are relatively small ( ~ 2 kcal / mol ) in the range Δ D Z = − 3 ~ 8 Å , and the entire I - BAR is bound to the lipid bilayer . A decrease in Δ G B correlated with an increase in curvature ( Fig . 3a , b ) . The macroscopic curvature of the membrane deduced from the diameter of the mem - brane tubule induced by I - BAR observed using transmission electron microscopy 9 , C exp , is 4 . 7 × 10 − 2 nm − 1 ( bro - ken line in Fig . 3a ) . The curvatures , C max = 9 . 2 × 10 − 2 nm − 1 and C ave = 2 . 0 × 10 − 2 nm − 1 at the binding free energy minimum correspond to 22 and 100 nm in diameter , respectively . C max roughly indicates the maximum limit of microscopic deformation that a single I - BAR can induce locally , and C ave gives a slightly more macroscopic average . The membrane deformation observed in this work can be considered as an initial process of the global deformation induced by the binding of the first I - BAR . Furthermore , given that C exp provides a macroscopic value due to the binding of multiple I - BAR , the order C max > C exp > C ave is reasonable . The mechanism underlying binding and deformation were investigated by conducting free energy compo - nent analysis , Δ G B = Δ E I - BAR − T Δ S I - BAR + ΔΔμ , based on the thermodynamic cycle ( Fig . 3c – f ) . Here , ensem - bles U and B indicate the I - BAR structural ensembles generated as membrane unbound ( Δ D Z = 30 . 5 Å ) and bound states ( 0 Å ) in solution , respectively .

Center of mass for the headgroup was used to calculate lipid density , MSD , and curvature . The lipid densities and MSDs were averaged over the range of ± 48 . 3 Å .

Δ E I - BAR and Δ S I - BAR are defined as the difference of the average conformational energies and entropies of I - BAR in vacuo between ensembles U and B , respectively . Similar to Δ G B , these energy terms were obtained as a function of Δ D Z ( Fig . 3c ) . A drastic change in membrane curvature occurred simultaneously with a change in energy component at around Δ D Z = 4 Å after the entire I - BAR bound to the membrane . The membrane curvature increased as the global minimum was approached . The energy components changed at Δ D Z = 0 Å : ΔΔμ = − 316 . 3 , Δ E I - BAR = 226 . 0 and − T Δ S I - BAR = 81 . 7 kcal / mol . The increase in − T Δ S I - BAR during the mem - brane binding process is consistent with I - BAR being very flexible in the unbound state but becoming less flexible as it bounds tighter to the membrane . To examine ΔΔμ , we calculated the I - BAR interaction energies Δ E int with the water molecules , ions , and lipids ( Fig . 3d ) . This approach was justified because the total Δ E int highly correlated with ΔΔμ 46 as seen in Fig . 3c , d . The binding of I - BAR to the lipid bilayer resulted in an increase in its Δ E int with the waters and ions , consistent with dehydration and counterion dissociation from the I - BAR surface . However , although counterion dissociation accompanies the increase in Δ E I - BAR , there was a significantly larger energy decrease due to inter - actions between I - BAR and the lipids ( Fig . 3d ) . This energy decrease was mainly caused by the formation of ~ 30 salt bridges between I - BAR and the lipid headgroups ( Fig . 3e ) , consistent with previous results showing that mutations in the positively charged residues of I - BAR decrease binding affinity 7 . Here , a salt bridge was consid - ered to be formed when the distance between any of the nitrogen atoms of basic group and the oxygen atoms of acidic group was within 3 . 2 Å . I - BAR is Relatively Flat and Flexible . The I - BAR crystal structure is a somewhat curved , whereas the MD calculations showed that I - BAR adopts a flatter structure in solution ( Fig . 3g ) . This flat structure makes it difficult to understand how I - BAR can cause membrane curvature if I - BAR acts as a rigid template . The tight binding of I - BAR with the membrane restricts the fluctuations of I - BAR compared to when I - BAR is in solution ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . After binding to the membrane , the structural variations of I - BAR along the mem - brane bilayer normal direction were relatively restricted , but large variations and fluctuations were observed along the lateral direction ( Fig . 3g and Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Although the I - BAR structures in MD1 and MD4 are significantly different in the lateral direction ( Fig . 3g ) , both caused the membrane to curve considerably ( Fig . 2d ) . I - BAR remains flexible even after tight binding to a lipid membrane , especially along the lateral direc - tion ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Therefore , I - BAR does not act as a completely rigid template , and so shape is not the deciding factor inducing membrane deformation . Principal component analysis also showed that I - BAR in solu - tion is intrinsically more flexible along the lateral direction and stiffer along the normal direction ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Although I - BAR is relatively flexible , this anisotropy may be related to the stiffness of I - BAR and be important for inducing membrane deformation along the membrane normal . Salt Bridge Formation Induces an Increase in Local Lipid Density and Membrane Curvature . The lipid headgoups that strongly interacted with I - BAR were situated around the tips of the dimer as shown by the interaction energy between each lipid headgroup and I - BAR ( Fig . 3h , i ) . DOPS binds more tightly to the I - BAR than DOPC and DOPE as shown in Supplementary Fig . S4 . After tight binding of I - BAR to the membrane in MD1 , the local density of the lipids was elevated around the I - BAR - bound region ( Fig . 3j ) and the lateral mean - square displacement ( MSD ) of the lipids was reduced compared to the membrane without I - BAR ( Fig . 3k ) . The local curvature reached a maximum value of 8 . 6 × 10 − 2 nm − 1 at X = 142 nm ( Fig . 3l ) , which concurs with the lowest energy minimum as well as the highest lipid density peak . Therefore , it is concluded that the salt bridge formation between I - BAR and the lipids increased the local density of the lipids , which in turn induced deformation of the membrane . The lowest minimum of negative curvature at X = 361 nm is considered to be an artifact of the periodic boundary condition , which compensates the positive membrane curvature induced by I - BAR . The local density of the lipids around the negative peak was significantly lower than the density of other regions , and MSD is considerably increased . Contributions of Charged Residues to Binding and Stability . I - BAR is a basic - charged protein domain containing many charged amino acid residues ( + 8e in total ) : 52 Lys and 20 Arg , and 18 Asp and 46 Glu in the 232 × 2 residues per dimer ( Fig . 4a , b ) . When an amino acid is considered to contact the lipid if the distance between any heavy - atom pair is 5 Å or less , the residue contacting the lipids most frequently is Lys , which form 28 . 5 ± 2 . 4 contacts with lipids and 15 . 4 ± 2 . 9 salt bridges at around the global free energy minimum ( the values after ± shows the standard deviation ) . Glu residues made the second largest number of contacts ( 13 . 2 ± 1 . 9 con - tacts , 4 . 2 ± 1 . 2 salt bridges ) , followed by Ser , Arg ( 8 . 1 ± 2 . 0 salt bridges ) , Gln , and Asp ( 1 . 1 ± 0 . 6 salt bridges ) . A total of 28 . 7 ± 3 . 8 salt bridges were formed between bound I - BAR and the lipids . DOPC , DOPE , and DOPS were in contact with 23 . 5 ± 1 . 4 ( 8 . 2 ± 1 . 5 salt bridges ) , 22 . 8 ± 3 . 1 ( 14 . 1 ± 3 . 2 ) and 7 . 2 ± 0 . 4 ( 6 . 5 ± 1 . 8 ) amino acid res - idues , respectively . The PC and PE headgroups are overall neutral whereas that of PS is negatively charged . Since the simulated membrane comprises four times as much DOPC and DOPE as DOPS , DOPS appears to interact more with I - BAR than do the other lipids . These observations agree with the experimental results that I - BAR forms more interactions with DOPS rather than with other lipids ( DOPC and DOPE ) and that the mutations of positively charged residues reduces the binding affinity of I - BAR to lipid membranes 7 . The binding affinity of point and multiple mutations of Lys and Arg residues relative to the wild - type was pre - viously measured by ELISA experiments 7 , and the correlation of binding affinity with the number of salt bridges between the mutated residues and lipids in wild - type was examined ( Fig . 4c ) . Basic patch mutant ( BPM ) desig - nates the K142A / K143A / R145A / K146A / K147A mutant . The binding affinities of the multiple mutations nega - tively correlated with the number of salt bridges , but no such correlation was seen with the point mutations . K40 , www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 SCientifiC REPORTS | 7 : 6808 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 06334 - 5 K121 , R128 , K136 , K143 , and K152 formed salt bridges with the lipids but their mutation to Glu did not affect binding affinity substantially ( blue data points in Fig . 4c ) . The effects of R128A are also negligible ( not shown in Fig . 4c ) . Since ~ 30 salt bridges were formed in total ( Fig . 3e ) , point mutations do not reduce the number of salt bridges drastically ; this could explain why they have little effects on binding affinity . K108 , K130 , and K171 ( red points in Fig . 4b , c ) did not form salt bridges with lipids , yet the K108E , K130E and K171A mutations considerably affect the binding affinity . These residues form intra - molecular salt bridges in the wild - type ( Fig . 4d ) , and thus their mutations should affect the stability of I - BAR rather than its interactions with lipids . Interestingly , K130A has little effect : even though the K130 - K174 salt bridge is broken , K171 - E174 salt bridge should be maintained . The K130E mutant might break these intra - helical salt bridges by forming an inter - helical E130 - K171 salt bridge . This hypothesis is supported by experiments using D112A and E174A Figure 4 .

Note that Fig . 4e does not represent the percentage of cell with filopodia but that of cells with I - BAR localization at filopo - dia . Because D112A and E174A mutants were not localized in filopodia , these mutants are considered to be una - ble to contribute to filopodia formations . Dotted signals in D112A and E174A mutants can be interpreted that the expressed proteins remained insoluble or were improperly fold , and then aggregated . The more notable effect of D112A mutant compared to E174A mutant may be related to the location of the mutated residue : the elimination of the salt bridges closer to the protein core could affect I - BAR stability more than the mutation of residue 174 , which situated near the tip of I - BAR . These mutations would be expected to destabilize I - BAR by eliminating the inter - helical salt bridges formed by D112 - R193 and K130 - E174 - K171 interactions ( Fig . 4d ) . Discussion In this study , we observed the spontaneous binding of I - BAR to a membrane using MD simulations . Regardless of the initial orientation I - BAR bound to the membrane through the same interface . This strong directivity , evident within 100 ns , is due to strong electrostatic interactions between I - BAR and lipid headgroups . We had anticipated that only one tip of the I - BAR dimer binds to the membrane , but found that both ends of the I - BAR bound to the membrane sequentially after first contact at the one tip of the dimer in this work . The entire binding of I - BAR to the membrane were observed in MD1 , MD2 , and MD4 within 200 ns . Although the orientation of I - BAR and the number of interactions between I - BAR and the membrane in MD2 were not significantly different from those in MD1 and MD4 , the observed curvature in MD2 at 200 ns was not yet positive . One possible reason is that the entire binding in MD2 happened ~ 30 ns later compared to those in MD1 and MD4 , as indicated by the arrows in Fig . 2b . Another possible reason is that , when the entire I - BAR bound to membrane , the membrane curvature in MD2 was negative , while those in MD1 and MD4 were happen to be positive ( Fig . 2d , Supplementary Movie S1 – 4 ) . Considering above , we expect that longer time is required to convert the negative membrane curvature to positive in MD2 , compared to the time spent in MD1 and MD4 . Global membrane deformations are induced by multiple BAR domains 16 . I - BAR domains were also reported 44 to be enriched at a curvature ~ 0 . 055 nm − 1 , although the arrangements of them are still unclear . Thus , the mem - brane deformation observed in this work should be considered as an initial process of the global deformation induced by the binding of the first I - BAR . More complicated factors such as arrangements and densities of I - BAR and effects of phosphoinositide should be considered for complete understanding of the mechanism underlining the global deformation . We speculate that interactions among multiple I - BAR domains may contribute to increase the binding of I - BAR to the membrane . Simulations including such conditions are currently under consideration . The MD results showed that I - BAR is relatively flexible both in solution and on the membrane , adopting a flatter shape compared to the crystal structure ( Fig . 3g ) . Therefore , I - BAR can induce the curvature change larger than expected given its flat structure . The formation of salt bridges between I - BAR and lipid decreased the interaction energy between them ( Fig . 3h , i ) and increased the local density of the lipids ( Fig . 3j ) , resulting in significantly deformation of the membrane into a concave shape ( Fig . 3l ) . The membrane curvature peaks are situated at the tips of I - BAR ( Fig . 3h , i , l ) , which also indicates that the I - BAR shape is not the deciding factor inducing membrane deformation . This indicates that electrostatic interactions are essential both for I - BAR to deform the membrane and for its directive binding with the membrane . The salt bridge analysis by MD and mutational experiments showed that the salt bridges between I - BAR and the lipids , as well as within I - BAR , are essential for membrane deformation . Since ~ 30 salt bridges are formed between I - BAR and the lipid headgroups , it is reasonable that single mutations of I - BAR surface residues generally have no notable effects on membrane binding affinity unless inter - helical salt bridges are eliminated , in which case the effect is severe . Likewise , mul - tiple mutations considerably affect the binding affinity ( Fig . 4b , c ) . These findings indicate that I - BAR must be somewhat stiff in order to deform the membrane although I - BAR is overall flexible and does not act as a rigid template . This is consistent with our observation that I - BAR is more flexible along the lateral direction and stiffer along the normal direction . Conformational changes of an F - BAR domain have been carefully investigated using MD 39 . The structures of the membrane - bound F - BAR are considerably different from the structures in the absence of lipid along both the normal ( α angle in the reference ) and lateral ( θ ) directions , whereas there is no notable difference between different membrane - bound F - BAR domains and among F - BARs in the absence of lipids . In contrast , the I - BAR structures in MD1 and MD4 are very different but caused a similar extent of membrane curving , suggesting that I - BAR is more flexible than F - BAR . In the case of N - BAR , Lyman et al . conducted MD simulations of N - BAR and lipids and reported that a considerable amount of water remains between the membrane and the positively charged concave face of N - BAR , even when it is tightly bound to the membrane 32 . We also observed that some water molecules remained at the binding interface during the binding and curving of the membrane . Not all of the BAR domain superfamily proteins appeared to function as a rigid template for membrane curvature as first expected from the structural diversity between BARs and F - BARs 47 . It is possible that the BAR domains have some bending capacity , which should be affected by the bending and stiffness of the membrane . The flexibility of the BAR domains might be important for generating relatively large subcellular structures such as filopodia and lamellipodia , both of which IRSp53 can localize 7 . Methods Molecular Dynamics Simulation . A lipid bilayer membrane consisting of 640 DOPC , 640 DPOE and 160 DOPS was constructed to mimic the liposome used in the experiments ( SI Text ) 7 . The X - ray structure of the I - BAR domain dimer ( 1WDZ . pdb ) 7 was placed above the equilibrated membrane in the arrangement shown in Fig . 1 . The system containing membrane only was simulated for 200 ns . The I - BAR – membrane and mem - brane - only systems contain c . a . 720 , 000 atoms , including TIP3P ( CHARMM ) water and 0 . 1 M KCl in a box 470 × 90 × 150 Å 3 . A simulation of I - BAR in solution was conducted in a box for of 190 × 70 × 100 Å 3 for 200 ns . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 8 SCientifiC REPORTS | 7 : 6808 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 06334 - 5 MD simulations were performed using NAMD 2 . 9 48 . The CHARMM 22 49 and 27 50 force fields were used for the protein and lipids , respectively . The systems were brought to thermodynamic equilibrium at 300 K and 1 atm , using a Langevin thermostat and barostat under semi isotropic pressure control for the membrane containing systems and isotropic pressure control for I - BAR in solution . Equations of motion were integrated using a time step of 2 fs . The long - range Coulomb energy was evaluated using the particle mesh Ewald method . Free Energy Analysis . The free energy profile of the I - BAR binding Δ G B was calculated using umbrella sampling conducted with NAMD 2 . 9 48 and by the multiple Benette acceptance ratio method with pymbar 51 . Δ D Z was defined as a reactive coordinate of the umbrella sampling , and a harmonic umbrella potential with a force constant of 50 kcal / mol / Å 2 was imposed . MD1 snapshots whose Δ D Z values were closest to the specified values ( − 4 . 0 to 30 . 5 Å every 0 . 5 Å , 3 . 6 to 3 . 9 Å every 0 . 1 Å ) were selected as the initial structures for umbrella sampling . A 1 - ns equilibration MD run and a 10 - ns umbrella sampling simulations was conducted for each snapshot . We confirmed the convergence of the umbrella sampling simulation by monitoring obtained free energies from the independent simulations for 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 and 10 ns ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . Results obtained from equal or longer than 6 - ns umbrella sampling simulations were not much different and the results obtained from 10 - ns simula - tions were used for analysis . S I - BAR was calculated as the sum of the translational , rotational and internal motion entropies of I - BAR ( see Supplementary Text ) 52 – 55 . Effective frequencies of principal modes 56 were used to calcu - late the internal motion entropy . Observation of Filopodia in HeLa Cells by Fluorescent Microscopy . The I - BAR domain of IRSp53 was expressed with green fluorescent protein as described in the ref . 7 . HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum . Transfection was performed with the Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS reagents ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocols . After 24 h of transfection , the cells were fixed and then observed under a confocal microscope ( Olympus FV1000D ) under a 100x oil immersion objective NA = 1 . 45 ( Olympus ) References 1 .
