In the cell nucleus , liquid - liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs ) is implicated in assembly of the nucleolus , as well as transcriptional clusters , and other nuclear bodies . However , it remains unclear whether and how phys - ical forces associated with nucleation , growth , and wetting of liquid condensates can directly restruc - ture chromatin . Here , we use CasDrop , a novel CRISPR - Cas9 - based optogenetic technology , to show that various IDPs phase separate into liquid condensates that mechanically exclude chromatin as they grow and preferentially form in low - density , largely euchromatic regions . A minimal physical model explains how this stiffness sensitivity arises from lower mechanical energy associated with de - forming softer genomic regions . Targeted genomic loci can nonetheless be mechanically pulled together through surface tension - driven coalescence . Nu - clear condensates may thus function as mechano - active chromatin ﬁlters , physically pulling in targeted genomic loci while pushing out non - targeted regions of the neighboring genome . INTRODUCTION Liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) is a fundamental mecha - nism for organizing the contents of living cells ( Banani et al . , 2017 ; Shin and Brangwynne , 2017 ) . LLPS is now recognized as important for driving assembly of a wide range of mem - brane - less condensates , including cytoplasmic structures such as germ ( P ) granules ( Brangwynne et al . , 2009 ) , stress granules ( Wippich et al . , 2013 ) , miRNA - induced silencing complex ( miRISC ) assemblies ( Sheu - Gruttadauria and MacRae , 2018 ) , and synaptic scaffolds ( Milovanovic et al . , 2018 ; Zeng et al . , 2016 ) . LLPS also appears to underlie nuclear body biogenesis , including nucleoli ( Brangwynne et al . , 2011 ; Feric et al . , 2016 ; Mi - trea et al . , 2016 ) , and likely many others ( Zhu and Brangwynne , 2015 ) . Associated liquid - to - solid phase transitions are also impli - cated in various diseases of pathological protein aggregation ( Molliex et al . , 2015 ; Murakami et al . , 2015 ; Patel et al . , 2015 ; Weber and Brangwynne , 2012 ) . Intracellular phase transitions arise from weak , multivalent interactions , often mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins / regions ( IDPs / IDRs ) , which are closely related to low complexity sequences and prion - like do - mains ( Brangwynne et al . , 2015 ; Elbaum - Garﬁnkle et al . , 2015 ; Kato et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2012 ; Nott et al . , 2015 ) . Phase transitions within the nucleus are particularly inter - esting , since nuclear condensates must directly interact with chromatin , and thus potentially control its organization and gene expression . Consistent with this , the assembly and dy - namics of nuclear condensates such as Cajal bodies , nucleoli , and speckles appear to impact chromatin architecture ( Pombo and Dillon , 2015 ; Quinodoz et al . , 2018 ; Wang et al . , 2016 ) . Recent studies suggest that phase separation of heterochro - matin protein 1 ( HP1 ) underlies formation of the heterochromatin domain , which is characterized as having higher chromatin den - sity and contains mostly transcriptionally silent regions of the genome ( Larson et al . , 2017 ; Strom et al . , 2017 ) . Phase separa - tion is also linked to active parts of the genome , with other phase - separated bodies often associated with euchromatic regions of lower chromatin density . For example , nucleoli assemble at transcriptionally active ribosomal DNA loci , in a transcription - dependent manner ( Berry et al . , 2015 ; Falahati et al . , 2016 ) . Phase separation has also been recently implicated in driving gene activation through nanoscale transcriptional con - densates assembled at enhancer - rich gene clusters ( Cho et al . , 2018 ; Chong et al . , 2018 ; Sabari et al . , 2018 ) . Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 , November 29 , 2018 ª 2018 Elsevier Inc . 1481 Despite the growing number of studies suggesting the impor - tance of phase separation for nuclear organization , the biophysics of these processes remains mysterious . From a bio - physical perspective , the genome is a complex viscoelastic polymer matrix ( Stephens et al . , 2017 ) , whose 3D architecture and mechanics are key factors governing gene expression ( Dek - ker and Mirny , 2016 ) . On the one hand , gene activation through transcriptional condensates has been proposed to arise from droplets pulling together distal regions of the genome , through a still uncharacterized mechanism ( Hnisz et al . , 2017 ) . This could be important for promoting enhancer - promoter interactions , that in some cases may be many kilobases away from one another ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) , or even reside on different chromosomes ( Lim et al . , 2018 ) . Surprisingly , this is conceptually similar to the proposed function of HP1 , which may drive heterochromatin formation by condensing distal regions of the genome into compact , transcriptionally silent foci . In any case , it is unclear how phase separation could give rise to mechanical forces capable of restructuring the genome , while providing the speci - ﬁcity required to coordinate associated gene activity . Moreover , the way in which the mechanics of the genome may in turn impact phase separation , as a potential feedback mechanism for controlling gene expression , is still completely unknown . These fundamental questions underscore the need for a quan - titative understanding of the forces at play in mediating interac - tions between condensates and speciﬁc regions of the genome , and their consequences for the dynamics of phase separation and chromatin organization . One of the key challenges to addressing this problem is the lack of tools for controlling phase transitions in living cells . Recently , we and colleagues introduced a suite of optogenetic tools that allow for spatiotemporally con - trolling the assembly and disassembly of intracellular conden - sates ( Bracha et al . , 2018 ; Dine et al . , 2018 ; Shin et al . , 2017 ) . However , these tools have not yet been combined with gene tar - geting approaches and instead have relied on random nucle - ation of condensates , or used light to direct phase separation to spatially deﬁned regions within the nucleus . There is thus an urgent need for new approaches to quantitatively probe the rela - tionship between the mechanics of phase separation and het - erogeneous chromatin structure , particularly for functionally relevant condensates targeted to speciﬁc genomic loci . Here , we introduce CasDrop , a novel CRISPR - Cas9 - based optogenetic technology , and use it to show that IDRs from various nuclear proteins including BRD4 , FUS , and TAF15 phase separate into liquid condensates that preferentially form in low - density genomic regions , and mechanically exclude chromatin as they grow . The condensates cannot be driven to form within dense satellite heterochromatin , nor do they mix with hetero - chromatic telomeres but , when speciﬁcally targeted to these re - gions , can cause them to be mechanically pulled together through surface tension - driven coalescence . A minimal physical model explains this preference for droplet condensation within low - density chromatin , due to the lower mechanical energy cost of droplets deforming softer genomic regions . These ﬁnd - ings suggest that nuclear condensates can function as me - chano - active chromatin ﬁlters , causing distal targeted genomic elements to be pulled together , while mechanically excluding non - speciﬁc background components of the genome . RESULTS Design of CasDrop , a System for Controlled Liquid Phase Condensation at Speciﬁc Genomic Loci To study phase behavior within the nucleus , we have developed an optogenetic platform termed CasDrop , which can induce localized condensation of liquid droplets at speciﬁc genomic loci . Inspired by the way native subnuclear assemblies form , we sought to control the local concentration of transcriptional regulators and other nuclear proteins , by programmable seeding ( Figure 1A ) . To achieve this , the CasDrop system is modularized with three components that allow for ( 1 ) pre - seeding , ( 2 ) optoge - netic molecular assembly , and ( 3 ) oligomerization - based phase separation ( Figure 1A ) . Taking advantage of well - characterized CRISPR - Cas9 technology for programmable targeting to spe - ciﬁc genomic loci , we build the ﬁrst piece of our system from enzymatically dead Cas9 ( dCas9 ) fused to SunTag ( ST ) ( Tanen - baum et al . , 2014 ) . The second construct linking genomic pre - seeding to optogenetic assembly involves single - chain variable fragment ( scFv ) antibody , cognate for the ST , fused to super - folder GFP ( sfGFP ) and the optogenetic dimerization protein iLID ( Guntas et al . , 2015 ) . When co - expressed in cells , these two constructs can self - assemble into a multimeric protein com - plex ( hereafter referred to as dCas9 - ST - GFP - iLID ) allowing for visualization of seeded sites , at the same time providing light - inducible binding scaffolds for recruiting various protein compo - nents , including proteins that contain IDRs . We use IDRs from a number of nuclear proteins to examine their phase behaviors ( Figure S1A ) . Of particular interest are tran - scriptional regulators including BRD4 , TAF15 , and FUS ; BRD4 has received much recent attention , as it contains a long IDR ( BRD4 D N ) , is highly enriched in enhancer clusters , and is thought to play an important role in transcriptional activation as well as elongation ( Love´n et al . , 2013 ; Kanno et al . , 2014 ) . We hypothe - sized that by expressing these IDRs fused to the protein sspB , binding between iLID and sspB upon blue light activation will lead to formation of IDR oligomers at the target genomic loci , which would in turn drive localized LLPS ( Figure 1A ) . We sequentially demonstrate the capacity of each CasDrop module targeted to telomeres , repetitive heterochromatic DNA elements found at the end of chromosomes . When dCas9 - ST - sfGFP - iLID is expressed , several ﬂuorescent puncta appear in the nucleus in a manner dependent on the expression of single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) cognate for telomeres ( Figure 1B ) . We then examined light - induced phase separation of the CasDrop system in the absence of any sgRNA . Prior to blue light activation , both dCas9 - ST - GFP - iLID and IDR - mCh - sspB show diffuse ﬂuores - cent signals in the nucleus ( Figure 1C ) . Upon blue light exposure , formationofIDRoligomersthroughdCas9 - ST - GFP - iLIDscaffolds leads torapid clustering ofliquid - like protein assemblies enriched with the CasDrop components ; these assemblies , including FUS , TAF15 , andBRD4IDRs , arehighlydynamicandreversibleandun - dergo frequent droplet coalescence events ( Figures 1C , 1D , S1B , and S1C ) . Among the three examined IDRs , BRD4 D N appears to form droplets most easily using the same activation protocol . In control experiments without the presence of either dCas9 - ST or IDR , no condensates are observed upon light activation , conﬁrm - ing the role of IDR oligomers as a driver for phase separation 1482 Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 , November 29 , 2018 ( Figures 1C and S1D ) . Hereafter , we focus our efforts mainly on CasDrop incorporating BRD4 D N , considering its known role in gene regulation as well as super - enhancer formation . The Effects of Pre - seeding and Activation Protocol on the Localization of BRD4 CasDrop We next ask how locus - speciﬁc targeting with sgRNA can alter the way phase separation proceeds . When the CasDrop system is co - expressed with sgRNA for telomeres , bright GFP foci are observed to colocalize with telomeric repeat - binding factor TRF1 , indicating successful scaffold targeting ( Figure 1E ) . Upon blue light activation , BRD4 D N - mCh - sspB liquid droplets nucleate and grow at the seeded telomeres ( Figure 1E ) . Interest - ingly , the number of droplets that are nucleated away from telo - meres depends sensitively on the activation protocol : for a rapid increase in blue light , many droplets nucleate throughout the nucleoplasm , while , for a light intensity ramping protocol , drop - lets nucleate almost exclusively at the telomere loci ( Figures 2A and 2B ; Video S1 ) . This behavior is consistent with the classic physics of nucleation barriers for phase separation ( (cid:1) Onuki , 2002 ) : for rapid activation , the system becomes deeply super - saturated in a short time , lowering the nucleation barrier to form many condensate nuclei that are not genomically targeted . For the incremental activation , on the other hand , initially the su - persaturation level is low , allowing for preferential condensation at the seeded sites , and then , in later stages , existing droplets keep growing rather than forming energetically costly new condensate nuclei . Simulations of the CasDrop system ( Fig - ure 2C ; Video S2 ) conﬁrm this picture ( see STAR Methods for de - tails ) . Control experiments without sgRNA for telomeres show that BRD4 droplets appear in an apparently random manner irre - spective of telomeres ( Figure 2A ) . Collectively , these results indicate that droplet localization during intracellular phase sepa - ration can be dynamically controlled by pre - seeding and the rate of supersaturation . The CasDrop system thus functions to localize a nucleating scaffold , thereby driving phase separation at the genomic location deﬁned by the sgRNA . Preferential Growth of IDR - Driven Condensates in Regions of Low Chromatin Density In our studies of the off - target nucleation of CasDrops , we noticed that droplets appear to form in regions of relatively low Figure 1 .

Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 , November 29 , 2018 1483 chromatin density . To quantify this , we examined cells not ex - pressing condensate - targeting guide RNA and determined where droplets form relative to the chromatin distribution prior to droplet condensation , using H2B - miRFP670 as a proxy for chromatin density ( Figure S2A ) . We ﬁnd that the distribution of H2B intensity in regions where droplets do form is shifted to signiﬁcantly lower H2B intensity compared with the H2B distri - bution in the entire nucleus ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Dividing these two distributions reveals that the propensity for droplet formation is a strong function of normalized H2B intensity , with droplets ex - hibiting a signiﬁcant preference for regions of low chromatin den - sity ( Figure 3C ) . Notably , the observed trend is not due merely to variations in the concentrations of CasDrop components , as similar analysis does not show biased distributions of the com - ponents ( Figure S2C ) . We ﬁnd a similar tendency for droplet growth in low - density chromatin for different IDRs driven to phase separate using the optoDroplet system we previously developed ( Figure S3A ) ( Shin et al . , 2017 ) . Chromatin Exclusion from Synthetic and Endogenous Condensates We also examined the chromatin density after droplets have formed . Remarkably , we ﬁnd that as the droplets grow chromatin is signiﬁcantly pushed out ( Figures 4A – 4C ) , creating easily visu - alized ‘‘holes’’ ( Figure 4B ) . Chromatin exclusion is not an artifact of optogenetic scaffolding , as we see similar behavior for con - densates formed with a variety of YFP - tagged IDR - containing full - length proteins overexpressed in cells ( Figures 4D and S3B ) ( Nott et al . , 2016 ) . These ﬁndings are consistent with the observation that several endogenous nuclear condensates , including nucleoli , Cajal bodies ( CBs ) , PML bodies , nuclear speckles , and paraspeckles are also associated with particularly low - density chromatin ( Figure 4E ; see also , e . g . , Mao et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , condensates assembled from IDRs exhibiting a broad spectrum of sequence features ( Table S1 ) not only preferentially nucleate in low - density chromatin regions , but upon nucleation and growth they also physically exclude chromatin . Minimal Model of Mechanical Exclusion of Chromatin by Condensate Formation To gain physical insight into why droplets that tend to exclude chromatin would preferentially grow in regions of low chromatin density , we mathematically model the mechanical interplay of condensates with the deformable chromatin network . We reasoned that by excluding chromatin , growing droplets would give rise to mechanical stresses ; indeed , in non - biological sys - tems , phase - separated droplets are known to be strongly impacted by the presence of a surrounding elastic network ( Style et al . , 2018 ) . We developed a minimal model to describe droplet formation in chromatin as an expanding sphere creating a cavity in an elastic matrix ( Zimberlin et al . , 2007 ) . A simpliﬁed expres - sion for the free energy cost D F of droplet nucleation is given by : D F ð R Þ = 4 pg R 2 (cid:2) 4 3 p R 3 (cid:1) D m , c drop (cid:2) 5 6 G (cid:3) Figure 2 .

Fluorescence images of the cell before and after activation pro - tocols are shown . When the ramping protocol is applied on a cell without telomere - targeting sgRNA , assembled droplets exhibited appar - ently random droplet localization irrespective of telomeres .

( C ) Simulations of our mechanical droplet exclu - sion model demonstrating that during CasDrop nucleationandgrowth inthepresence ofpre - seed sites ( white circles denote stiff seed cores ; light blue halos denote surrounding regions of enhanced concentration , ɸ A ) targeted droplet localization improves with decreasing activation rate .

Fractions of droplets overlapping with a pre - seed site at the ﬁnal time shown are given in percentage . See also Videos S1 and S2 . 1484 Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 , November 29 , 2018 where R is the radius of the droplet , g is the surface tension of the droplet , D m is the chemical potential difference between molecules in the supersaturated solution and in the droplet phase , c drop is the saturated bulk concentration of molecules in - side the droplet , and G is the elastic ( Young’s ) modulus of the deformed surrounding matrix . The ﬁrst two terms reﬂect classic nucleation theory ( (cid:1) Onuki , 2002 ) , while the third term reﬂects a mechanical energy contribution from the chromatin elasticity . Using estimates of the key parameters of surface tension , mo - lecular interaction energy , and stiffness of euchromatin and het - erochromatin ( Feric et al . , 2016 ; Ou et al . , 2017 ; Stephens et al . , 2017 ) ( see STAR Methods ) , the model predicts that small drop - lets can nucleate in both low and high chromatin density regions , but that droplet growth to an optically resolvable scale will be most probable in mechanically soft regions of the lowest chro - matin density . Simulations of the mechanical model using a sinusoidally varying chromatin stiffness show clear droplet preference for minima in the stiffness landscape ( Figure 3D ; Video S3 ) . Mechanical Exclusion of CasDrop Condensates from Heterochromatin A prediction of this model is that mechanical deformation energy will prevent droplets from growing beyond a critical size in sufﬁciently chromatin - dense regions , i . e . , those near the high - density end of the experimentally measured droplet growth pro - pensity ( Figure 3C ) . To test this prediction , we examined major satellite repeats , dense heterochromatin regions prominent in mouse cultured cells ( Guenatri et al . , 2004 ) , which are highly enriched in the heterochromatin protein HP1 a ( Figure 5A ) . We again use the CasDrop system to locally assemble BRD4 con - densates by focusing the laser within the nucleus . When BRD4 droplets are induced in low - density chromatin regions , devoid of HP1 a - miRFP670 label , BRD4 droplets readily condense ( Fig - ure S4A ) . However , when we attempt to write droplets directly onto HP1 a - rich satellite heterochromatin , resolvable droplets tend to condense only around the periphery ( Figures 5B and 5C ) ; this effect is not a result of IDR exclusion from the heterochromatin , since it robustly occurs even after enrichment of IDR - sspB component through sgRNA targeting ( Fig - ure 5B ; Video S4 ) . Simulations of condensate nucleation at a compact heterochromatin core demonstrate ﬂower petal - like conﬁgurations strikingly similar to those seen in our experiments ( Figure 5D ; Video S5 ) . Interestingly , in some cases HP1 a - miRFP670 - enriched heterochromatin foci exhibit apparent sub - regions of weak HP1 a - miRFP670 ﬂuorescence . When we attempt to nucleate BRD4 droplets on these foci , we ﬁnd that BRD4 droplets occasionally nucleate within ; as they grow , Figure 3 .

( E ) Immunocytochemistry against protein markers of well characterized nuclear condensates was performed in HEK293 cells expressing H2B - miRFP670 . All condensates are associated with decreased local chromatin density . See also Table S1 and Figure S3 . 5F ; Video S6 ) . We observe qualitatively similar heterochromatin immiscibility with TAF15 and FUS CasDrops ( Figures S4D and S4E ) . Collectively , these behav - iors provide strong support for the pres - ence of mechanical stresses that build up in chromatin surrounding growing condensates . These data are thus consis - tent with our mechanical droplet exclu - sion model , although HP1 a itself may provide additional unfavorable interac - tions ( Figure S5 ) to reinforce this mechan - ical immiscibility . Mechanical Restructuring of Genomic Loci Induced by Droplet Condensation These ﬁndings of mechanical chromatin exclusion are surprising , given that enhancer clusters and other nuclear con - densates have been hypothesized to bring speciﬁcally targeted genomic ele - ments into closer proximity ( Hnisz et al . , 2017 ; Shin and Brang - wynne , 2017 ; Zhu and Brangwynne , 2015 ) . To explore these mechanical effects , we further examined the condensates tar - geted to telomeres .

Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 , November 29 , 2018 1487 CasDrop condensates do not appear to mix with the targeted heterochromatic telomeres , which tend to localize at the droplet periphery ( Figures 6A , S6A , and S6B ) . But the two nevertheless partially wet one another , and are thus adherent . When two drop - lets seeded at different telomeres fuse with one another ( Fig - ure 6A ) , the surface tension is sufﬁcient to produce correlated motion between loci , and pull them into close proximity ( Fig - ure 6A ) . From dimensional arguments , the force , F , associated with the surface tension , g , of fusing droplets should scale as F (cid:3) g , [ , where [ is a relevant microscopic length scale . With [ (cid:3) 1 m m here , the typical force scale is estimated to be on the order of 0 . 1 – 1 pN , in the range of force production measured for in - vitro - condensed protein phases ( Herling et al . , 2015 ) . Ignoring viscous effects , telomere displacement should then be given by the ratio of droplet surface tension , g , and effec - tive genome elasticity , G , i . e . , D X (cid:3) g / G ( Figure 6B ) ; estimated values for these two parameters yield predicted displacements that are consistent with our measurements ( Figure S7A ; STAR Methods ) . In some cases , droplets can detach from associated telomeres , which then relax back to a more distal position ( Fig - ures 6C – 6F ) , consistent with droplet detachment releasing the intervening ‘‘spring - loaded’’ chromatin . DISCUSSION Our work shows how nuclear condensates can both sense and restructure their local genomic environment . We ﬁnd that a broad range of different IDR - containing proteins exclude chro - matin , which in some cases manifests in large - scale deforma - tion of the chromatin network . These proteins display a remarkable diversity of their physical characteristics , exhibiting IDRs that range from relatively uncharged ( e . g . , TAF15 N ) to highly basic ( e . g . , SRSF2 IDR ) and mixed charge ( e . g . , SART1 ) , from relatively hydrophobic ( e . g . , HSF1 ) to highly hydrophilic ( e . g . , RNPS1 ) . Thus , mechanical exclusion of chro - matin appears to occur largely irrespective of the physico - chemical properties of the protein that drives phase separation and likely underlies the low chromatin density found within various IDR - rich nuclear bodies . These ﬁndings are consistent with the observation in a prior study that the germ plasm pro - tein DDX4 appears to exclude chromatin ( Nott et al . , 2016 ) . Interestingly , DDX4 condensates do not exclude single - stranded RNA , nor single - stranded DNA , which instead can both strongly partition into the droplets . Such selectivity could potentially help facilitate the ﬂow of genetic information , as the Figure 6 .

See also Figure S6 . 1488 Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 , November 29 , 2018 single - stranded RNA transcripts from excluded chromatin are pulled into adjacent condensates . The tendency for nuclear condensates to exclude chromatin has dramatic consequences within the heterogeneous nuclear environment . Exclusion of chromatin from a growing droplet causes the chromatin network to be deformed . Deformation of elastic ( or viscoelastic ) materials gives rise to a strain energy , which represents a mechanical energy stored within the matrix ( Landau and Lifshitz , 1970 ) . This deformation and associated en - ergetic cost is thermodynamically unfavorable , such that the elastic properties of the matrix become an important factor in the growth dynamics of the droplet . In non - living systems , it is known that this effect can strongly impact phase separation and can even give rise to uniform droplets of a size set by the matrix elasticity ( Style et al . , 2018 ) . Our theoretical analysis and simulations show that , as a result of this deformation energy , droplets will tend to favor growth in softer , lower - density regions of the genome . Small droplets that do form in high chromatin density regions ultimately dissolve and act as IDR sources for the growing droplets within the softer , less - dense regions . We experimentally observed the striking consequences of this ef - fect , in ﬂower - petal - like arrangement of droplets around hetero - chromatin foci , or in rare cases the extrusion of droplets from within dense and mechanically stiffer heterochromatin . This ef - fect can thus give rise to genomic rearrangements and is likely important for promoting preferential growth of transcriptional condensates in mechanically softer , low - density genomic re - gions associated with active gene expression . HP1 protein provides an interesting apparent counter - example to our ﬁndings of the generality of chromatin exclusion by IDR - rich condensates . HP1 has been described as a phase separation prone - protein , whose ability to form condensed liquid droplets could facilitate chromatin compaction ( Larson et al . , 2017 ; Strom et al . , 2017 ) . Interestingly , however , HP1 does not appear to readily form distinct droplets when coupled to the Cry2 system ( Figure S5 ) . But HP1 - rich foci are associated with relatively high - density ( hetero ) chromatin , suggesting that , if it promotes phase separation , it does so in a manner different from many of the IDR - rich proteins and endogenous conden - sates that we have examined here , which tend to exclude , rather than recruit chromatin . The tendency of different proteins to compact or decompact chromatin likely reﬂects a rich interplay between compaction - promoting chromatin - targeting domains , and IDR - rich domains that tend to push out chromatin . Consistent with this proposed role of different protein do - mains , our results shed light on how targeted condensates can bring distant loci together . Many IDR - rich proteins possess tar - geting ‘‘reader’’ motifs , such as the bromodomain found in BRD4 , which targets this phase separation - prone protein to his - tones exhibiting acetylated lysine resides ( Dey et al . , 2003 ) . The CasDrop system replaces such endogenous targeting motifs with programmable dCas9 , enabling dissection of the biophysi - cal consequences of IDP targeting . We use CasDrop to show how IDP targeting promotes localized phase separation , through a process that appears closely related to the recently described ‘‘diffusive capture’’ mechanism , which can amplify IDR concen - tration to drive localized phase separation ( Bracha et al . , 2018 ) . Our work also reveals how surface tension can mediate targeted droplet coalescence . We quantify the associated forces and genomic deformations , which can bring two or more targeted loci into closer proximity . Our ﬁndings suggest that the way in which droplets deform chromatin reﬂects a mechanical interplay between ( 1 ) the effective adhesivity of condensates to chro - matin , likely mediated in large part through their targeting do - mains , ( 2 ) the closely related parameter of droplet surface tension , with respect to other elements of the nucleoplasm , and ( 3 ) the local chromatin ( visco ) elasticity . The ability to ‘‘pull in’’ targeted genomic loci can be contrasted with our ﬁnding that a broad spectrum of IDR - driven condensates does the opposite to non - targeted genomic elements , i . e . , ‘‘pushing them out . ’’ Combing these ﬁndings , we propose a chromatin ﬁl - ter model for condensate - induced genome restructuring , in which transcriptionally active condensates such as the nucleolus ( Berry et al . , 2015 ; Feric et al . , 2016 ) and super - enhancer clusters ( Cho et al . , 2018 ; Sabari et al . , 2018 ) play bifunctional roles , serving to both ﬁlter out non - speciﬁc elements of the genome , while pulling together targeted regions to which they are bound ( Figure 7 ) . Studies of the interplay between intracellular mechanics and phase separation have only just begun . But continued progress in this area will be important both in the context of mechanics of the cytoplasm , where cytoplasmic condensates interact with the actomyosin cytoskeleton , for example , and in the nucleus , where condensates interact with the polymeric matrix of the genome , and other mechanical elements ( Feric and Brangwynne , 2013 ) . Within the nucleus , this challenge is particularly rich , given that Figure 7 .

( bottom ) Schematics for ‘‘Chromatin ﬁlter’’ model showing how targeted condensation can bring distal genomic loci together , while mechanically excluding non - targeted background chromatin . Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 , November 29 , 2018 1489 many nuclear condensates form on small size scales where local mechanical heterogeneities become important . The ﬁeld of nu - clear mechanobiology has identiﬁed a link between mechanical forces and gene expression . However , the underlying biophysi - cal mechanisms are still largely unknown ( Cho et al . , 2017 ; Kirby and Lammerding , 2018 ) . Our ﬁndings that the dynamics of nu - clear condensates are sensitive to the local mechanical environ - ment suggest that the impact of mechanical forces on gene expression might ultimately be mediated by their effect on nu - clear condensates . Future work will explore these emerging links between nuclear mechanics and phase separation , and their impact on functional changes in gene expression .

Brieﬂy , transfection reagents and DNA plas - mids were diluted with OPTI - MEM ( GIBCO ) . Each well received 100 m L of transfection mixture containing a total of 1 m g DNA . The transfection mixture was removed 6 - 24 hr post - transfection . Cells transiently transfected were typically imaged between 24 - 48 hr post - transfection . Lentiviral transduction Lentivirus was produced by cotransfecting the transfer plasmids , pCMV - dR8 . 91 , and pMD2 . G ( 9 : 8 : 1 , mass ratio ) into HEK293T cells grown to approximately 70 % conﬂuency in 6 - well plates using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent ( Promega ) per manufacturer’s pro - tocol . A total of 3 m g plasmid and 9 m L of transfection reagent were delivered into each well . After 2 days , supernatant containing viral particles was harvested and ﬁltered with 0 . 45 m m ﬁlter ( Pall Life Sciences ) . Supernatant was immediately used for transduction , concentrated 10 - fold using Lenti - X Concentrator ( Takara ) , or stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:4) C in aliquots . NIH 3T3 or HEK293T cells were grown to 10 % – 20 % conﬂuency in 12 - well plates and 100 - 1000 m L of ﬁltered viral supernatant was added to the cells . Media containing virus was replaced with fresh growth medium 24 hr post - infection . Cells infected were typically imaged no earlier than 72 hr after infection . Cell line generation To establish cell lines expressing multiple constructs , sequential lentiviral transduction was performed , together with ﬂuorescence activated cell sorting ( FACS ) when needed . Wild - type NIH 3T3 ( or HEK293T ) cells were transduced with lentivirus containing dCas9 - ST under SFFV promoter and scFv - sfGFP - iLID . This transduced NIH 3T3 cell line was then used to generate other cell lines by lentiviral transduction , to express required constructs indicated for each experiment . To increase population expressing dCas9 - ST in the transduced HEK293T cell line , cells were sorted on a FACSAria Fusion ﬂow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) with gating for sin - gle - cells expressing high level of BFP and intermediate level of GFP . Polyclonal cell pool was collected , grown and recovered in growth medium . This sorted cell line was then transiently transfected with additional constructs for CasDrop / Cry2 - fusion experiment . Constructs FUS N - mCh - sspB was ﬁrst generated by inserting FUS N ( 1 - 214 ) , mCherry , and sspB coding sequence into a pHR - based vector ( Shin et al . , 2017 ) . For other TR - mCh - sspB constructs , the FUS N in FUS N - mCh - sspB was swapped out for the DNA sequence encoding BRD4 D N ( 462 - 1362 , Addgene 31351 ) , TAF15 N ( 1 - 208 , kind gift from Marc Diamond lab , UT Southwestern ) . scFv - sfGFP - iLID was generated by adding iLID ( Addgene 60413 ) between GB1 and NLS in scFv - GCN4 - GFP ( Addgene 60906 ) . A promoter for dCas9 - ST ( Addgene 60910 ) was modiﬁed from dSV40 to SFFV to enhance expression . Fragments of mCherry , sspB ( Addgene 60415 ) , miRFP670 ( Addgene 79987 ) , TRF1 ( Addgene 64164 ) and HP1 a ( Addgene 17652 ) were ampliﬁed by PCR . If not speciﬁed otherwise , all fragment assemblies are performed using In - Fusion Cloning Kit ( Takara ) . All miRFP670 - Cry2 fragments used here are identical to the one described previously ( Shin et al . , 2017 ) except for a ﬂuorescent reporter swapped from mCh to miRFP670 . For EYFP con - structs , FM5 - EYFP ( kind gift from Marc Diamond lab , UT Southwestern ) was digested with NheI and open reading frames were subcl - oned onto 5 0 end using In - Fusion Cloning Kit ( Takara ) . To create FM5 - ORF - mCherry - Cry2 constructs , FM5 - EYFP was digested with NheI and AscI and DNA backbone lacking EYFP was gel puriﬁed using QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit . mCherry - Cry2 was PCRed from pHR - mCherry - Cry2 , digested with NheI and AscI , gel puriﬁed , and ligated into FM5 backbone using Quick Ligase ( NEB ) . FM5 - mCherry - Cry2 was then digested with NheI and open reading frames were subcloned onto 5 0 end using In - Fusion . All open reading frames were PCRed from recombinant DNA vectors obtained from AddGene : CCNT1 ( 14607 ) , HSF1 ( 32538 ) , MLLT3 ( 49428 ) , SART1 ( 38087 ) , TAF15 ( 84896 ) , SRSF2 ( 84020 ) , PRPF6 ( 51740 ) , with the exception of RNPS1 , which was synthesized by GenScript . For sgRNAs targeting telomeres and major satellite repeats ( sgTel : TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTA and sgMaj : CAAGAAAACTGA AAATCA ) , pLV - sgCDKN1B ( Addgene 60905 ) was ﬁrst digested with BstXI and XhoI followed by gel electrophoresis and extraction . Then , PCR fragments for sgRNAs were generated using a sequence - speciﬁc forward primer ( 5 0 - CCCTTGGAGAACCACCTT GTTG GN x GTTTAAGAGCTATGCTGGAAACAGCA - 3 0 , where GN x is the base pairing sequence ) and a common reverse primer ( 5 0 - GATCCTAGTACTCGAGAAAAAAAGCACCG - 3 0 ) . Fragments were then ligated and assembled into the ﬁnal vectors again using In - Fusion Cloning Kit . Immunocytochemistry HEK293 cells expressing H2B - miRFP670 were ﬁxed using 3 . 5 % PFA ( Electron Microscopy Services ) in PBS for 15 min . Cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 25 % Triton - X in PBS for 20 min . Non - speciﬁc epitopes were blocked for 1 hr using blocking buffer ( PBS , 0 . 1 % Triton - X , 10 % normal goat serum from Vector Laboratories ) . Primary immunostaining was performed with the following antibodies overnight at 4 (cid:4) C in blocking buffer : PML ( Mouse , AbCam ab11826 , 1 to 50 ) , Coilin ( Rabbit , Santa Cruz sc32860 , 1 to 100 ) , TDP - 43 ( Rabbit , ProteinTech 10782 - 2 - AP , 1 to 100 ) , SMN1 ( Mouse , Santa Cruz sc - 32313 , 1 to 100 ) , SC35 ( Mouse , AbCam ab11826 , 1 to 1000 ) , and FBL ( Mouse , AbCam ab4566 , 1 to 40 ) . Cells were then washed 3X with 0 . 1 % Triton - X in PBS . Secondary immunostaining was performed with the following antibodies from Invitrogen in blocking buffer at e3 Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 . e1 – e6 , November 29 , 2018 room temperature for 90 min : AlexaFluor 546 goat anti - rabbit ( A11010 , 1 to 400 ) , AlexaFluor 546 goat anti - mouse ( A11030 , 1 to 400 ) . Cells were washed 3X with 0 . 1 % Triton - X in PBS . DNA was visualized with 2 m g / mL Hoechst dye ( ThermoScientiﬁc ) , staining for 15 min in PBS . Finally , Hoechst was removed and replaced with PBS prior to imaging . Controls without primary antibodies were per - formed to ensure speciﬁcity of primary stain . Microscopy All images are taken using 60X immersion objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) on a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope . An imaging chamber is maintained at 37 (cid:4) C and 5 % CO 2 . For live cell imaging , cells are plated on the ﬁbronectin ( Millipore Sigma ) coated 35 - mm glass - bottom dishes ( MatTek ) and grown typically overnight . For global activation , cells are usually imaged with a 488 - nm laser but when the blue light intensity needs to be reduced due to high sensitivity of the optogenetic proteins ( iLID and Cry2 ) , a 440 - nm laseris used in conjunction with a dichroic ﬁlter for the 488 - nm laser . This allows for attenuation of the blue laser intensity at the specimen plane below 0 . 1 m W . For local activation , a region of interest ( ROI ) is deﬁned to guide area to be scanned with blue lasers . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) is performed similarly using ROI . QUNATIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Image analysis All data analysis on images is performed using custom - built MATLAB scripts . Brieﬂy , for telomere tracking , raw images are ﬁrst Gaussian ﬁltered to reduce noise and then peaks corresponding to telomeres are detected based on their peak intensity . Trajectories are generated from a series of detected coordinates based on proximity . To identify and track the boundary of either droplets or het - erochromatin , segmented binary images are obtained using the edge detection routine in MATLAB . Analyzed results are manually inspected to check validity . For nucleation propensity analysis , pixels within the nucleoplasm ( nucleus excluding nucleoli ) from pre - activation images were mean - centered and rescaled by their standard deviation for each cell before pooling . The probability distributions of H2B pixel in - tensity for pixels where droplets would form following blue light activation were generated with binning such that each bin contains an equal number of nucleoplasm pixels . To estimate the errors , this was performed using droplet locations obtained over ten evenly spaced time points from 3 to 30 seconds following activation . For the probability distribution of H2B intensity for all nucleoplasm pixels , same binning method and ﬁve pre - activation images which errors were estimated over were used . The nucleation propensity at a given H2B pixel intensity interval deﬁned by each bin was then calculated as the ratio of the probability of droplet pixels to that of all nucleoplasm pixels , with error propagated in quadrature . Minimal model of mechanical exclusion of chromatin by droplet formation Here we consider the following relation between pressure and size for a spherical cavity , derived from a neo - Hookean strain energy relation to determine the inward pressure on a cavity with deformation ratio l in an incompressible elastic medium of Young’s modulus G ( Zimberlin et al . , 2007 ) : P G = 5 6 (cid:2) 2 3 l (cid:2) 1 6 l 4 : Eq . 1 This pressure , which reﬂects the energetic cost of deforming the chromatin , complements classical nucleation theory to describe the energetics of droplet formation in a dense elastic matrix . We add the energy cost of deforming the elastic chromatin matrix to the contributions of bulk chemical potential gain and surface tension cost to obtain the total free energy cost to create a spherical droplet of radius R , obtaining : D F ð R Þ = 4 p R 2 g (cid:2) 4 3 p R 3 (cid:1) D m , c drop (cid:2) 5 6 G + 2 3 l + 1 6 l 4 (cid:3) ; Eq . 2 where g is the surface tension of the droplet , D m is the chemical potential difference between molecules in the supersaturated solution and the droplet phase , c drop is the saturated bulk concentration of molecules inside the droplet , l = R = r mesh , and r mesh is a typical local mesh size in the chromatin network . Since r mesh (cid:5) R , the deformation ratio l is very large ( see Estimation of parameters ) , and we obtain the following simpliﬁed result : D F ð R Þ = 4 p R 2 g (cid:2) 4 3 p R 3 (cid:1) D m , c drop (cid:2) 5 6 G (cid:3) : Eq . 3 For values of D m , c drop less than the critical pressure P c = 5 G = 6 , the free energy increases to inﬁnity for large R , suggesting that for sufﬁciently dense chromatin , droplet size is restricted . However , when Dm c drop > Pc , the droplet can grow without constraint . If the elastic environment is heterogeneous , as chromatin density is in the cell , then regions of low stiffness should be favored for phase separation and out - compete denser regions for molecules . Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 . e1 – e6 , November 29 , 2018 e4 Estimation of parameters used in the minimal model We estimated the key parameters in this model based on literature : d g z 4 3 10 (cid:2) 7 N / m for nucleolar protein in vitro ( Feric et al . , 2016 ) . d r mesh z 7 - 13 nm ( Ou et al . , 2017 ) . A rough estimate of pore size can be given by the mean free path between chromatin ﬁbers based on the chromatin size and volume fraction : r mesh = r c ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 (cid:2) f = f 3 p where r c is the width of a chromatin ﬁber , estimated at 7 nm and f is the volume fraction of chromatin . The fraction has been estimated by electron microscopy at approximately 0 . 12 - . 21 in euchromatin and about 0 . 37 - . 52 for heterochromatin , giving pore sizes of about 14 nm and 7 nm respectively . d c drop has been estimated using ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy both in the similar biomimetic Corelet system ( Bracha et al . , 2018 ) and for in vitro droplets ( Wei et al . , 2017 ) to be approximately 5 - 10 3 10 (cid:2) 5 molecules / nm 3 . d D m is estimated at approximately 2 - 5 k B T , being the chemical potential difference per molecule between the dilute and condensed phases . d G is dependent on the crosslink frequency of the matrix , which can be estimated by f 2 , the square of the volume fraction of the matrix ( Style et al . , 2018 ) . The effective ‘‘spring constant’’ of the nucleus for a lamin knockout has been estimated to be on order 1 nN / m m ( Stephens et al . , 2017 ) , which dividing by a microscopic length scale of 1 m m would give about 1 kPa for the nucleus on average . Based on this we assume that the least stiff chromatin , with a fraction of about 0 . 21 has a modulus of about 100 Pa and that this value scales with f 2 . Simulations Our minimal mathematical model for condensate thermodynamics within an elastic medium was implemented within a diffuse - interface formalism that permits numerical study of collective droplet nucleation , growth , and coarsening kinetics with mechanical ef - fects . The nucleoplasmic ﬂuid is described as an effectively ternary system composed of dCas9 - ST + scFV - sfGFP - iLID ( species A ) , TR - mCh - ssp ( species B ; TR = Transcriptional Regulator ) , and other ‘‘solvent’’ molecules ( species C ) . An extended ternary regular so - lution free energy functional is employed to describe ﬂuid thermodynamic phase behavior within a mechanical network ; F = R ½ 4 A ln 4 A + 4 B ln 4 B + 4 C ln 4 C + c AB 4 A 4 B + c AC 4 A 4 C + c BC 4 B 4 C + P i ½ l e i ð r ! ; R Þ V 4 i (cid:6) 2 + 5 G ð r ! Þð 4 A + 4 B Þ = 6 + P A ð r ! Þð 1 (cid:2) 4 A Þ 2 (cid:6) d r ! ; where 4 i is the space - dependent volume fraction of molecular population i ˛ f A ; B ; C g ; c ij controls the strength of interaction between i and j molecules ; ~ l i ð r ! ; R Þ isthenetwork - modiﬁedsurfaceenergycoefﬁcientfor population i ( seebelow ) ; G ð r ! Þ isthespace - dependent Young’smodulusofthenetwork ; and P A ð r ! Þ isaﬁeldthatenhancestheconcentrationofspecies A atpre - seedsites . Theﬂuidphase is taken to be incompressible such that 4 A + 4 B + 4 C = 1 . Dynamics are given by a generalized diffusion equation , v 4 i v t = M i V 2 v F v 4 i where i ; j ˛ f A ; B g ( C is eliminated via incompressibility ) , M i is the mobility of population i , and t is dimensionless time . The effect of the elastic medium is incorporated into a space - dependent bulk term ( that proportional to G ð r ! Þ ) which locally mod - ulates the chemical potentials , and a space - and droplet size - dependent interfacial energy coefﬁcient ~ l i ð r ! ; R Þ = l i + G ð r ! Þ r mesh ð 2 + r 3mesh = 2 R 3 Þ = 9 , where l i is the surface energy coefﬁcient in the absence of a network . The interfacial terms associated with the network are negligible compared to the bulk network term when R a 10 r mesh . We therefore neglected the effect of the network on interfacial energy ( let ~ l i z l i ) and studied the regime in which R a 10 r mesh . The telomere pre - seeding simulations shown in Figure 2C were conducted by initializing a homogeneously mixed ﬂuid with f A = 0 : 1 , f B = 0 : 1 , f C = 0 : 8 ( red dot in Figure S7B ) , c AC = c BC = 1 , l i = 0 : 75 , and setting G ð r ! Þ = 0 : 6 within randomly positioned pre - seed regions , P A ð r ! Þ = 0 : 005 within an annulus of radius 10 around each stiff pre - seed core , and G ð r ! Þ = P A ð r ! Þ = 0 elsewhere . Non - zero P A values enhance the local concentration of A around pre - seed sites , analogous to the initial enhancement of dCas9 - ST + scFV - sfGFP - iLID around telomeres in the experimental system . Blue light - induced heterodimerization of sspB with iLID is described as an in - crease in A - B interaction strength , c AB = c 0 AB + ð c max AB (cid:2) c 0 AB Þð 1 (cid:2) e (cid:2) t = t ½ blue (cid:6) Þ , where c 0 AB = (cid:2) 5 and c max AB = (cid:2) 9 : 25 are the inactivated state and activated state interaction strengths , respectively . t ½ blue (cid:6) is the time constant for blue light activation , which is inversely proportional to the rate of increase in blue light intensity . For the red dot shown in Figure S7B , decreasing c AB from (cid:2) 5 to (cid:2) 9 . 25 in - duces phase separation into A + B - rich droplets and an A + B - poor background . Following equilibration with pre - seed sites as described above , blue light is applied globally with intensity increasing according to the equation above for a given value of t ½ blue (cid:6) . Results for two values of t ½ blue (cid:6) are shown in Figure 2C . Droplets are more effectively localized at pre - seed sites with decreasing quench rate , as observed in our experiments . The simulations demonstrate that enhanced concentration of A at pre - seed sites promotes rapid local nucleation and subsequent diffusion - limited growth . Growth proceeds by drawing in nearby A and B molecules , which creates an expanding radial zone depleted in A and B . If depletion zones of neighboring pre - seed sites overlap before droplets can nucleate between pre - seeds , then all droplets become localized at pre - seed sites . If drop - lets nucleate throughout the system before depletion zones overlap , then long - lived droplets also appear away from seed sites . For ideal diffusion - limited growth , the radius of the depletion zone grows as R DZ z ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 DS 0 t p , where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient of A and B molecules and S 0 is their supersaturation . The time required for overlap of neighboring depletion zones is therefore t (cid:7) z ð d = 2 Þ 2 = 2 DS 0 , where d is the distance between pre - seed sites . e5 Cell 175 , 1481 – 1491 . e1 – e6 , November 29 , 2018 The simulations shown in Figure 3D with a spatially heterogeneous elastic network were conducted with blue light applied globally as described above , but with P A ð r ! Þ = 0 and G ð r ! Þ = G 0 ½ cos ð 4 p x = L x Þ + cos ð 4 p y = L y Þ + 2 (cid:6) = 4 , where L x and L y are the lengths of the simulation cell . The constant G 0 was increased linearly from 0 to 0 . 18 between t = 250 ( after droplet nucleation ) and t = 750 . This delay in the introduction of mechanical deformation energy results in spatially uniform droplet nucleation and an initial droplet size distribution that is independent of network stiffness , consistent with our neo - Hookean model . The subsequent introduction of nonzero G ð r ! Þ induces a transition into the large droplet size regime discussed above , in which the dominant effect is a shifting of the bulk chemical potential according to local stiffness and preferential droplet growth in softer regions . The simulations shown in Figure 5D were conducted as those shown in Figure 3D but with blue light applied locally inside a stiff heterochromatin - like domain , wherein G 0 was increased linearly from 0 to 0 . 18 between t = 100 ( after droplet nucleation ) and t = 600 . Estimation of targeted chromatin displacement When two droplets seeded at speciﬁc genomic loci fuse , surface tension favors making the resulting large droplet spherical . This results in a force that attracts the two loci toward one another , displacing each one a distance D x from its original position , as sche - matized in Figure S7A . This displacement induces deformation in the chromatin that results in an elastic restoring force pulling the loci back toward their original positions ; at mechanical equilibrium , the balance between droplet surface area and loci displacement re - ﬂects the relative magnitude of the surface tension g and chromatin Young’s modulus G . Quantitatively , when two droplets of radius R fuse to form a sphere , the resulting droplet has an equilibrium radius of 2 1 / 3 R . Due to surface tension , there is an energetic cost to elongating the droplet from the spherical conﬁguration . This results in a force F tension between the telomeres , which to linear order in the elongation d = 2R (cid:2) 2 1 = 3 R (cid:2) D x , and assuming that the droplet is constrained to remain ellipsoidal , reads F tension = g ð 2R (cid:2) 2 1 = 3 R (cid:2) D x Þ . The elastic force on a locus of size r locus displaced by D x is given by the elastic Stokes’ law , F elastic = (cid:2) 6 p Gr locus D x . Force bal - ance thus yields D x z g (cid:5) 2 R (cid:2) 2 1 = 3 R (cid:6)(cid:7) ð g + 6 p Gr locus Þ : Eq . 4 Taking a telomere size of about 10 nm , a g of 4 3 10 (cid:2) 7 N / m as before , a droplet size of 1 m m and a G in the range of 10 - 100 Pa results in a displacement D x z 10 - 100 nm .

IDR - Driven Condensates Occupying Regions of Low Chromatin Density Is Observed in Various Systems , Related to Figure 4 ( A ) Proteins ( TAF15 , SRSF2 IDR , RNPS1 ) tagged with mCherry - Cry2 were co - expressed with H2B - EYFP in HEK293 cells . Prior to blue light exposure , ORF - mCherry - Cry2 was observed as diffusely distributed ( in the case of TAF15 and SRSF2 IDR ) or slightly enriched in the interchromatin space ( RNPS1 ) . Following blue light exposure , droplets formed in areas of low H2B signal . Images shown are following 15 min of activation with blue light . SRSF2 IDR , which primarily consists of serine - arginine dipeptides , corresponds to amino acids 92 - 221 of the full - length protein .
