Shiga toxin and other toxins of this family can escape the endocytic pathway and reach the Golgi apparatus . To synchronize endosome to Golgi trans - port , Shiga toxin B - fragment was internalized into HeLa cells at low temperatures . Under these condi - tions , the protein partitioned away from markers des - tined for the late endocytic pathway and colocalized ex - tensively with cointernalized transferrin . Upon subsequent incubation at 37 (cid:56) C , ultrastructural studies on cryosections failed to detect B - fragment—specific la - bel in multivesicular or multilamellar late endosomes , suggesting that the protein bypassed the late endocytic pathway on its way to the Golgi apparatus . This hy - pothesis was further supported by the rapid kinetics of B - fragment transport , as determined by quantitative confocal microscopy on living cells and by B - fragment sulfation analysis , and by the observation that actin - depolymerizing and pH - neutralizing drugs that modu - late vesicular transport in the late endocytic pathway had no effect on B - fragment accumulation in the Golgi apparatus . B - fragment sorting at the level of early / recy - cling endosomes seemed to involve vesicular coats , since brefeldin A treatment led to B - fragment accumu - lation in transferrin receptor—containing membrane tu - bules , and since B - fragment colocalized with adaptor protein type 1 clathrin coat components on early / recy - cling endosomes . Thus , we hypothesize that Shiga toxin B - fragment is transported directly from early / recycling endosomes to the Golgi apparatus . This pathway may also be used by cellular proteins , as deduced from our finding that TGN38 colocalized with the B - fragment on its transport from the plasma membrane to the TGN . Key words : Shiga toxin ¥ endosomes ¥ Golgi ¥ intra - cellular transport ¥ clathrin B acterial and plant protein toxins use functions of higher eucaryotic cells for the transduction of their activity ( O(cid:213)Brien et al . , 1992 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1996 ) . For example , they rely on intracellular trans - port to reach their target molecules that often reside in the cytoplasm . Toxins such as diphtheria toxin are endocy - tosed and then cross membranes at the level of endosomes in a pH - dependent process . Other toxins such as Shiga toxin , verotoxins , Cholera toxin , and ricin do not depend on acidic pH in endosomes for intoxication of cells . Rather , these toxins are sensitive to treatments that affect the biosynthetic / secretory pathway suggesting that mem - brane transfer occurs at the level of the Golgi apparatus or the ER that these toxins have to reach by retrograde trans - port from the plasma membrane ( Pelham et al . , 1992 ) . Es - pecially toxins of the latter group are thus interesting mod - els to study transport routes in animal cells that to date are still little explored . Shiga toxin and the virtually identical VT - 1 are pro - duced by Shigella dysenteriae and by certain enterohemor - rhagic strains of Escherichia coli , respectively ( O(cid:213)Brien et al . , 1992 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1996 ; Johannes and Goud , 1998 ) . These toxins have been identified as the etiologic agents of the hemolytic and uremic syndrome and of hem - orrhagic colitis ( O(cid:213)Brien et al . , 1992 ; Lingwood , 1996 ) . They are composed of a catalytically active A - subunit and a receptor binding B - subunit . The A - subunit , a N - glycosi - dase that inhibits protein synthesis through the modifica - tion of 28S rRNA , depends upon a noncovalent interac - tion with the B - subunit for its binding to target cells and its intracellular transport . The B - subunit is a homopentamer of B - fragments that form a symmetrical ring - like structure in solution . The B - subunit binds with high affinity to the Address correspondence to Dr .

E - mail : johannes @ curie . fr The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 974 cellular toxin receptor , the glycolipid globotriaosylceramid ( Lingwood , 1993 ) . The toxin—receptor complex is then in - ternalized , likely via clathrin - dependent mechanisms ( Sand - vig et al . , 1989 ) . In many cancer cell lines , internalized toxin or B - subunit is transported from endosomes via the TGN / Golgi apparatus to the ER ( Sandvig et al . , 1992 , 1994 ; Johannes et al . , 1997 ; Kim et al . , 1998 ) . The mecha - nisms of this retrograde transport remain elusive . Notably , the precise site at which Shiga toxin leaves en - dosomes to target the TGN / Golgi apparatus is still un - known . The existence of two potential transport routes be - tween endosomes and the TGN has been suggested because of the identification of proteins that are common to both compartments ( for reviews see Gruenberg and Maxfield , 1995 ; Mellman , 1996 ; Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ) . A direct transport route from late endosomes ( LE ) 1 to the TGN has been hypothesized for the cation - independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( CI - MPR ) and the MPR of 46 kD ( MPR46 ) , which both bind mannose 6 - phosphate— tagged proteins at the level of the TGN and deliver these proteins to LE ( von Figura , 1991 ; Munier - Lehmann et al . , 1996 ) . MPRs can also be found to a lesser extent in the plasma membrane and early endosomes ( EE ) . Ligand dis - sociation occurs at low pH of LE , from where uncharged receptors are transported back to the TGN in a reaction regulated by the small GTP - binding protein Rab9 ( Lom - bardi et al . , 1993 ; Riederer et al . , 1994 ) . Based on the find - ing that small quantities of a marker protein for EE and recycling endosomes ( RE ) , transferrin ( Tf ) , can be de - tected in the TGN ( Fishman and Fine , 1987 ; Stoorvogel et al . , 1988 ) , the existence of a direct transport route from EE / RE to the TGN has been hypothesized . Two other proteins that have been studied in some detail are TGN38 and the protease furin ( Humphrey et al . , 1993 ; Reaves et al . , 1993 ; Chapman and Munro , 1994 ; Molloy et al . , 1994 ; Pon - nambalam et al . , 1994 ) . At steady - state , both are concen - trated in the TGN . However , both proteins are also found in the plasma membrane and endosomes , and antibodies directed to these proteins are transported from the plasma membrane to the TGN . The itinerary of these proteins from endosomes to the TGN is still unknown . In this study we have investigated the transport route taken by Shiga toxin B - fragment from EE to the Golgi ap - paratus . We found that the B - fragment accumulated with Tf in EE / RE when incubated with HeLa cells at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C . From this compartment , the B - fragment was rapidly trans - ported to the TGN / Golgi apparatus , without apparent pas - sage via LE . Our immunolocalization studies suggest that B - fragment sorting at the level of EE / RE involves adaptor protein type 1 ( AP - 1 ) clathrin coats . We thus hypothesize the existence of a direct transport route between EE / RE and the Golgi apparatus , which may also be used by cellu - lar proteins , as judged from the finding that TGN38 colo - calized with B - fragment during transport to the TGN . Materials and Methods Cells HeLa cells were grown in DME containing 4 . 5 g / liter glucose ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( GIBCO BRL ) , 0 . 01 % penicillin / streptomycin , 4 mM glutamine , and 5 mM pyruvate in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . Reagents and Antibodies Cy3 , iodine , radioactive sulfate , and radiolabeled EGF ( Amersham Life Science , Inc . , Arlington Heights , IL ) , iodobeads , Tf - HRP , and FITC ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Rockford , IL ) , 5 - ( [ 4 , 6 - dichlorotriazin - 2 - yl ] amino ) fluorescein , ferro - Tf , CytoD , and Noc ( Sigma , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France ) , Bafi ( Fluka , Saint - Quentin - Fallavier , France ) , BFA ( Epicentre Technologies Corp . , Madison , WI ) , FITC - labeled Dex3 , and tetramethyl - rhodamine - labeled EGF ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) were pur - chased from the indicated commercial sources .

Hoflack ( Institut Pasteur , Lille , France ) , and K . von Figura ( Universit(cid:138)t G(cid:154)ttingen , G(cid:154)ttingen , Ger - many ) , respectively . The polyclonal anti - FITC antibody , the polyclonal anti - HRP antibody , and FITC - or Texas red—coupled secondary antibod - ies were purchased from Molecular Probes , Inc . , Sigma , and Jackson Im - munoResearch Labs , Inc . ( West Grove , PA ) , respectively . Plasmids To construct a plasmid expressing a mutant B - fragment carrying a tandem of sulfation sites at its COOH terminus ( termed B - ( Sulf ) 2 ) , a previously described PCR - based strategy was adopted ( Johannes et al . , 1997 ) . First , expression vector pSU108 was modified to introduce EcoRI and NotI re - striction sites at the 3 (cid:57) end of B - fragment cDNA ( pB - EcoRI - NotI ) . PCR primers EN1 ( 5 (cid:57) - ACTAGCTCTGAAAAGCGGCCGCTAATGACTC - AGAATAGCTC - 3 (cid:57) ) and EN2 ( 5 (cid:57) - CCGCTTTTCAGAGCTAGTGAA - TTCACGAAAAATAACTTCGC - 3 (cid:57) ) were used with plasmid - specific primers ShigaAtpE ( 5 (cid:57) - CACTACTACGTTTTAAC - 3 (cid:57) ) and Shiga - fd ( 5 (cid:57) - CGGCGCAACTATCGG - 3 (cid:57) ) to produce DNA fragments that , in a second PCR with primers ShigaAtpE and Shiga - fd , yielded a fragment that was cloned into the SphI and SalI restriction sites of pSU108 . After polymerization cycles with sulfation site carrying oligodeoxynucleotides S1 ( 5 (cid:57) - TATGAATTCGAGGAACCTGAGTATGGAGAAGAGGAA - CCTGAGTATGG - 3 (cid:57) ) and S2 ( 5 (cid:57) - GCTACTTTTTTGCGGCCGCTTT - CTCCATACTCAGGTTCCTCTTC - 3 (cid:57) ) , the resulting fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites of pB - EcoRI - NotI . Se - quences derived by PCR were verified by dideoxy - sequencing ( Amer - sham Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Purification and Labeling of Recombinant B - fragments and Tf Purification of recombinant B - fragments , labeling with 5 - ( [ 4 , 6 - dichlorotri - azin - 2 - yl ] amino ) fluorescein and radiolabeling with iodine were essentially done as described ( Johannes et al . , 1997 ) . Labeling with Cy3 was done ac - cording to manufacturer(cid:213)s instructions ( Amersham Life Science , Inc . ) . Tf was labeled with 5 - ( [ 4 , 6 - dichlorotriazin - 2 - yl ] amino ) fluorescein essentially as described for B - fragment ( Johannes et al . , 1997 ) . In brief , 1 mg of ferro - Tf ( Sigma ) in 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , were added to 250 mM NaHCO 3 and a 20 - fold molar excess of 5 - ( [ 4 , 6 - dichlorotriazin - 2 - yl ] amino ) fluorescein ( Sigma ) and incubated by end - over - end rotation for 30 min at room temperature . 0 . 2 mM NH 4 Cl was added , and labeled protein was purified on gel filtration columns ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .

Mallard et al . Direct B - fragment Early Endosome to Golgi Transport 975 placed on ice , fluorophore - labeled B - fragment was added at 1 (cid:109) g / ml in Hepes - containing culture medium , and then incubated with cells for 30 min . The cells were then washed three times with ice - cold culture medium and shifted to either 19 . 5 (cid:56) C for 45—60 min in Hepes - containing culture me - dium or to 37 (cid:56) C in a CO 2 incubator , as indicated in the figure legends . Marker proteins and antibodies were added at concentrations as follows : 10 (cid:109) g / ml Tf , 1 (cid:109) g / ml EGF , 1 mg / ml Dex3 , polyclonal anti—CI - MPR at 1 : 500 dilution , anti - TGN38 ( 2 - F7 - 1 ) at 2 (cid:109) g / ml . Drugs were added at the concentrations and duration as indicated in the figure legends . After incu - bation , cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 , fixed with 3 % PFA for 10 min , permeabilized with sa - ponin , stained with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies , and then mounted , as described previously ( Johannes et al . , 1997 ) . Slides were analyzed by confocal microscopy . Confocal Microscopy Confocal laser scanning microscopy was done on a TCS4D confocal mi - croscope ( Leica AG , Heerbrugg , Switzerland ) based on a DM microscope interfaced with an Argon / Krypton laser . Simultaneous double fluores - cence acquisitions were performed using the 488 - nm and the 568 - nm laser lines to excite FITC and Texas red dyes using 63 (cid:51) or 100 (cid:51) oil immersion Neofluar objectives ( numerical aperture (cid:53) 1 . 4 ) . The fluorescence was se - lected with appropriate double fluorescence dichroic mirror and band pass filters and measured with blue - green—sensitive and red side—sensitive one photomultipliers . Confocal Microscopy on Living Cells HeLa cells were plated on 42 - mm glass cover slides . Cy3 - labeled B - frag - ment was bound to these cells and then internalized at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , as de - scribed above . The cover slide was rapidly transferred to a POC - chamber ( Bachofer Laboratoriumsger(cid:138)te , Reutlingen , Germany ) on the stage at the confocal microscope , and culture medium at 37 (cid:56) C was added . Acquisi - tions during incubation at 37 (cid:56) C were done at frequencies as indicated in the figure legends . Care was taken to minimize light exposure as it was no - ticed that high image acquisition frequencies and high laser light intensi - ties prevented B - fragment transport to the Golgi apparatus and caused the appearance of the protein in unidentified structures ( not shown ) . Per time point , four optical slices were taken . Throughout an 80 - min experi - ment , offset in z - direction was minimal . However , sometimes it was neces - sary to readjust the microscope . For quantification as shown in Fig . 3 B , the average fluorescent intensity in the Golgi area was divided by the av - erage fluorescent intensity over the whole cell . To determine the fraction of Golgi - associated fluorescent material in percent after 80 min at 37 (cid:56) C , the ratio between total fluorescent contents in the Golgi area over whole cell total fluorescent contents was calculated . Background correction fac - tors were determined from cells that did not have internalized B - frag - ment . All measurements were done using NIH image software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . Recycling Experiment FITC - coupled B - fragment was added to 0 . 75 (cid:51) 10 5 HeLa cells and inter - nalized at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C for 1 h , as described above . The cells were then put on ice , and in half of the wells anti - FITC antibody was added at 5—20 (cid:109) g / ml . In pilot experiments on cell surface bound FITC - labeled B - fragment it was found that these concentrations allowed for (cid:46) 80 % quenching of FITC fluorescence . When these concentrations of antibody were added to cells that had not been treated with FITC - coupled B - fragment , no internal staining could be detected showing that fluid phase internalization at this concentration was negligible ( not shown ) . However , if cells had internal - ized FITC - coupled B - fragment , then also some anti - FITC antibody was transported inside the cells , presumably in interaction with FITC ( not shown ) . After 30 min on ice in the presence of anti - FITC antibody , the cells were either fixed directly or shifted to 37 (cid:56) C for the indicated periods of time in the continued presence or absence of the anti - FITC antibody before fixation . The fluorescence per given cell number ( 30 cells per field ) of mounted cells was then analyzed with an enhanced video camera ( Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ ) . Exposure time was 1 . 5 s , and the average fluorescence intensity was determined ( five fields per experi - ment ) . In the absence of anti - FITC antibody , the average fluorescence slightly decreased during incubation at 37 (cid:56) C , presumably resulting from a loss of some cell - associated , FITC - coupled B - fragment , an observation that is also made if cells that had bound radiolabeled B - fragment are shifted to 37 (cid:56) C ( not shown ) . To determine quenching due to recycling , av - erage fluorescence intensity at every time point after incubation at 37 (cid:56) C in the presence of anti - FITC antibody was corrected for loss of material ( see above ) and then divided by the average fluorescence intensity obtained after the 19 . 5 (cid:56) C incubation . Immunoelectron Microscopy For immunoelectron microscopy , B - fragment binding ( 1 (cid:109) M ) was per - formed on HeLa cells grown on 50 - cm 2 round tissue culture plates ( 10 7 cells ) , as described above . After washing , cells were incubated at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C in Hepes - containing culture medium supplemented in some experiments with BSA - gold ( OD (cid:53) 5 ; a gift from H . J . Geuze , University of Utrecht , Utrecht , The Netherlands ) or Tf - HRP ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) ( 20 (cid:109) g / ml ) , fixed directly or shifted to 37 (cid:56) C , as indicated in the figure legends . Fixa - tion was done by adding to the medium an equivalent volume of 8 % PFA in 0 . 2 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , for 1 h , and further fixation was done with a fresh 4 % PFA solution in 0 . 1 sodium phosphate buffer for 1 h more . Cryosectioning and immunogold labeling was done as described previously ( Slot et al . , 1991 ) . In the case of mAbs , a rabbit anti—mouse linker antibody was used ( DAKOPATTS AB , Älvsj(cid:154) , Sweden ) . For triple labeling , cryosections were fixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde between the first and second mAb . Quantification on Cryosections Evolution of colocalization between B - fragment and BSA - gold ( see Fig . 5 D ) : membrane profiles that were labeled for BSA - gold ( at least two gold particles ) were identified by scanning over cryosections of cells that had internalized B - fragment and BSA - gold at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , or that were shifted to 37 (cid:56) C for an additional 15 min . It was then determined whether these pro - files were also labeled for B - fragment ( 100 membrane profiles were ana - lyzed per condition ) . To determine whether BSA - gold—positive bulk fluid phase elements ( defined as 150—300 - nm structures that contained (cid:36) 50 BSA - gold parti - cles ) were also positive for (cid:103) - adaptin , the former were identified on fields of observation that were labeled with (cid:36) 15 (cid:103) - adaptin—specific gold parti - cles . 10 such fields with 15 bulk fluid phase elements were analyzed . Determination of the fraction of marker protein—specific label in (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane profiles ( Table I ) : all intracellular B - fragment ( 3 , 809 gold particles ) , Tf - HRP ( 2 , 170 gold particles ) , or BSA - gold—specific ( 8 , 245 gold particles ) label on 298 fields of observation was analyzed for colocalization with (cid:103) - adaptin . Colocalization was scored as positive only if there were at least two (cid:103) - adaptin—specific gold particles on a membrane profile on which B - fragment , Tf - HRP , or BSA - gold—specific gold particles were localized in (cid:44) 100 nm . Depending on the marker protein , determina - tions were done on one to five independent labeling experiments . To determine the distribution of B - fragment and Tf - HRP—specific im - munogold label in (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane profiles ( see Fig . 10 A ) , 204 fields of observation ( a total number of 2 , 512 and 1 , 990 B - fragment and Tf - HRP—specific gold particles , respectively , were counted ) with 278 (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane profiles ( at least two (cid:103) - adaptin—specific gold labels ) that contained 273 and 294 B - fragment and Tf - HRP—specific gold particles , respectively , were analyzed on triple - labeled cryosections ( as shown for example in Fig . 9 , F—I ) . For statistical evaluation , B - fragment or Tf - HRP—specific gold particles in (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane pro - files were taken as denominators . The chi - square test showed a significa - tive difference ( P (cid:44) 0 . 001 ) between the fraction of B - fragment—specific gold particles in only B - fragment and (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane pro - Table I . Localization of Marker Proteins in (cid:103) - Adaptin—positive Membrane Profiles Staining of (cid:103) - adaptin versus Colocalization % B - fragment 9 . 7 ( (cid:54) 0 . 62 ; n (cid:53) 5 ) Tf - HRP 13 . 2 ( (cid:54) 3 . 1 ; n (cid:53) 4 ) BSA - gold 0 . 27 ( n (cid:53) 1 ) Quantification was done as described in Materials and Methods on cryosections of HeLa cells that had internalized BSA - gold and B - fragment or Tf - HRP and B - frag - ment for 1 h at 19 . 5¡C . The percentage of marker protein—specific gold label in (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane profiles is given ( (cid:54) SE ; n , the number of independent determinations on different labeling experiments ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 976 files ( 180 out of 273 ) , when compared with the fraction of Tf - HRP—spe - cific gold particles in only Tf - HRP and (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane pro - files ( 122 out of 294 ) . To determine the fraction of (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane profiles co - labeled with B - fragment and / or Tf - HRP gold particles ( see Fig . 10 B ) , 417 such profiles ( at least two (cid:103) - adaptin—specific gold labels ) were analyzed on three independent triple - labeling experiments ( as shown for example in Fig . 9 , F—I ) . Using the chi - squared test for paired series , profiles that were only labeled for B - fragment were found to be significantly more abundant than those labeled for only Tf - HRP ( P (cid:44) 0 . 01 ) . Retrograde Transport Assay and EGF Degradation Iodinated B - Glyc - KDEL ( 5 , 000 cpm / ng ) was bound to 10 5 HeLa cells as described above . After incubation at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C for 1 h and shift to 37 (cid:56) C for the indicated periods of time , cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed in SDS sample buffer . Samples were run on 10—20 % polyacryl - amide—SDS gradient gels , analyzed by autoradiography , and quantified with a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics , Inc . , Sunnyvale , CA ) using the ImageQuant software . In each experiment , the percentage of glycosy - lated protein was determined . For EGF degradation experiments , HeLa cells were incubated for 30 min in serum - free culture medium . Iodinated EGF ( 750 Ci / mmol ; Amer - sham Life Science , Inc . ) was then added in serum - free Hepes containing culture medium at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C for 1 h . Cells were washed , shifted to 37 (cid:56) C for the indicated periods , and then put on ice . Culture medium was taken off , the remaining cell - associated radioactivity and the amount of TCA - solu - ble material in the culture medium were determined . TCA - soluble counts were then expressed as percentage of total cell - associated radioactivity . Sulfation Analysis Analysis of sulfation on B - ( Sulf ) 2 was essentially done as described ( Jo - hannes et al . , 1997 ) . In brief , B - ( Sulf ) 2 was bound to sulfate - starved HeLa cells ( 10 5 ) on ice . After washing , the cells were incubated in sulfate - free , HBSS buffer ( GIBCO BRL ) at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C for 1 h , shifted to 37 (cid:56) C for the indi - cated times ( 0—90 min ) , and incubated for a final 15 min at 37 (cid:56) C in HBSS buffer containing 2 . 5 mCi / ml of [ 35 S ] sulfate ( 1 , 000 Ci / mmol ; Amersham Life Science , Inc . ) . B - ( Sulf ) 2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates ob - tained with RIPA buffer using the mAb 13C4 and protein A—Sepharose ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Washed immunoprecipitates were boiled in sample buffer and analyzed by PhosphorImager after separation by SDS - PAGE on Tris - Tricine gels ( Sch(cid:138)gger and von Jagow , 1987 ) . Results Incubation at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C Induces B - fragment Accumulation in EE in HeLa Cells We have previously shown that in HeLa cells , Shiga toxin B - fragment is transported from the plasma membrane via endosomes , the TGN and the Golgi apparatus to the ER ( Johannes et al . , 1997 ) . To analyze transport from endo - somes to the Golgi apparatus in further detail , we devel - oped a low temperature incubation protocol that allowed the synchronization of this transport step . B - fragment was incubated with HeLa cells at various temperatures , and it was found that at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , the protein accumulated effi - ciently in endosomes , while its transport to the Golgi ap - paratus was blocked ( Fig . 1 ) . These data are consistent with earlier studies that showed that the plant toxin ricin is not transferred to the Golgi apparatus during low temper - ature incubations , and that under these experimental con - ditions Shiga toxin is much less toxic to HeLa cells than at physiological temperatures ( Sandvig et al . , 1989 ) . We then compared B - fragment transport through the endocytic membrane system at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C to that of marker proteins with established pathways . When fluorophore - labeled B - fragment ( Cy3 - coupled , red ) and ferro - Tf ( flu - orsceine - coupled , green ) , a marker protein of EE and RE , were incubated together with HeLa cells for 1 h at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , both were found at the same intracellular sites ( Fig . 1 A ) . As shown in the inserts of Fig . 1 A , the colocalization be - tween both proteins was essentially complete . In some cells , B - fragment and Tf were found to label perinuclear structures in addition to the peripheral vesicular compart - ments ( Fig . 1 A , arrows ) . These may represent perinuclear RE , an hypothesis that is consistent with the observation that when cells were shifted to 37 (cid:56) C , peripheral Tf - label was more rapidly lost than perinuclear Tf - label ( not shown ) . In addition to recycling receptors such as the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) back to the plasma membrane , EE also play an important role in providing access to LE and lyso - somes . When B - fragment ( green fluorescence ) and lyso - some - bound EGF ( red fluorescence ) were internalized at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C for 1 h , both gave staining patterns that were juxta - posed to each other , but which did not overlap ( Fig . 1 B , insets , arrows ) , a distribution that was in marked contrast to the high degree of colocalization of B - fragment and Tf ( see Fig . 1 A ) . As shown in Fig . 1 C , juxtaposition of B - fragment— ( green fluorescence ) and EGF - labeled ( red fluorescence ) structures was essentially lost when cells that had internalized B - fragment and EGF at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C were shifted for 10 min to 37 (cid:56) C . Under these conditions , EGF was transported to lysosomes and B - fragment to the Golgi apparatus ( see also below ) . Since EGF and B - fragment colocalized at very early time points after internalization ( not shown ) , these findings suggest that both proteins were partitioned away from each other at the level of sort - ing endosomes . Similar results , i . e . , a separation between two marker proteins , were obtained when EGF ( red fluo - rescence ) was internalized together with Tf ( green fluores - cence ) at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 1 D ) . We next compared by confocal microscopy B - fragment ( red fluorescence ) transport to that of a fluid phase marker , FITC - coupled 3 - kD dextran ( Dex3 , green fluo - rescence ) ( Fig . 1 E ) . After cointernalization of Dex3 and B - fragment at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , Dex3 - positive structures often had a comet - like appearance in that they were composed of strongly labeled bulk fluid phase elements ( Fig . 1 E , insets , large arrows ) with tail - like extensions ( small arrows ) . Im - portantly , B - fragment containing structures were found in the same areas of the cell , but overlapped with the tail - like elements ( Fig . 1 E , insets , small arrows ) . The situation was different for cells that had cointernalized Dex3 and EGF at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , in the case of which EGF staining overlapped preferentially with the bulk - phase element of Dex3 - con - taining structures ( not shown ) . These data suggest that the B - fragment accumulated at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C in EE / RE where the protein segregated from lyso - some - bound , membrane - associated EGF and from the bulk of the fluid phase . The observation of B - fragment segrega - tion from the bulk fluid phase was further confirmed by electron microscopical studies ( see Fig . 5 , A and B ) . The B - fragment Passes within Minutes from Early / Recycling Endosomes into the Golgi Apparatus with a Fraction of Internalized Molecules Being Recycled to the Plasma Membrane We next set out to follow B - fragment transport from EE / Mallard et al . Direct B - fragment Early Endosome to Golgi Transport 977 RE to the Golgi apparatus . HeLa cells were incubated at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C with B - fragment , transferred for increasing times to 37 (cid:56) C , fixed , and then processed for ultracryomicrotomy followed by labeling with specific antibodies ( Fig . 2 ) . As described above , B - fragment ( Fig . 2 A ; 10 - nm gold parti - cles ) accumulated at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C in vesicular and tubular struc - tures ( 50—100 nm ) that also contained the TfR ( 15 - nm gold particles ) . The kinetics of B - fragment transport from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus was followed by warming the cells to 37 (cid:56) C . To identify membranes of the TGN , cryosec - tions were also stained for MPR46 , which at steady state in HeLa cells is mostly localized to the TGN , in contrast to the CI - MPR ( not shown ; see below ) . After 2 - min incuba - tion at 37 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 2 B ) , some of the B - fragment ( 10 - nm gold particles ) accumulated already in membranes of the TGN in colocalization with MPR46 ( 15 - nm gold particles ) ( Fig . 2 B ) , suggesting that the B - fragment entered the Golgi apparatus at the level of the TGN , in agreement with our previous results on sulfation site—carrying B - frag - ment mutants ( Johannes et al . , 1997 ) . At 10 min ( Fig . 2 C ) , B - fragment labeling ( 10 - nm gold particles ) at the Golgi apparatus increased significantly . As shown in Fig . 2 D , double - labeling experiments with B - fragment ( 15 - nm gold particles ) and MPR46 ( 10 - nm gold particles ) again identi - Figure 1 .

For marker concen - trations see Materials and Methods . Digital images ( four integration frames ) were acquired by confocal microscopy . The right panel represents the superposition of the red and green images . Insets show selected areas at higher magnification . In C , EGF ( red ) and B - fragment ( green ) were internalized at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , as in B . The cells were then shifted to 37 (cid:56) C for 10 min before fixation . Note that B - fragment and EGF - specific labeling did basically not overlap . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 978 fied some of the B - fragment—positive membranes as the TGN . After 30 min at 37 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 2 E ) , all cisternae of the Golgi apparatus were strongly labeled with B - fragment ( 10 - nm gold particles ) . The fast appearance of B - fragment in the TGN and the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus was surprising since it seemed difficult to reconcile such a kinetics with transport via LE ( Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ; see below ) . The kinetics of B - fragment transport from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus was therefore quantitatively studied following two inde - pendent protocols , first on living HeLa cells by confocal microscopy , and second by biochemical means using pro - tein sulfation as a TGN - specific marker . For the experiments on living cells , Cy3 - labeled B - frag - ment was internalized into HeLa cells at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , as de - scribed above . The cells were transferred to the stage of a confocal microscope and analyzed at 10—15 - min intervals during incubation at 37 (cid:56) C . Data obtained in a typical ex - periment are shown in Fig . 3 A . At time point 4 min at 37 (cid:56) C ( time necessary to adjust the microscope settings ) , B - fragment was found in vesicular cytoplasmic structures ( Fig . 3 A ) that corresponded to EE / RE since they were also labeled by cointernalized fluorescein - tagged Tf ( Fig . 3 C ) . During further incubation at 37 (cid:56) C , accumulation in a juxtanuclear region became visible ( Fig . 3 A ) , which at the end of the experiment was shown to be staining of the Golgi apparatus , as judged from colabeling with Golgi markers on fixed cells ( not shown ) . It was also found that , using a double - fluorescence detection protocol on living cells , Cy3 - tagged B - fragment accumulated in compart - Figure 2 . Kinetics of B - fragment transport from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus revealed by im - munoelectron microscopy in HeLa cells . ( A ) B - fragment was internalized for 1 h at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , cells were fixed and prepared for cryosectionning as described under Materials and Methods . B - fragment ( 10 - nm gold particles ) was detected in tubular and vesicular elements that were also labeled for the TfR ( 15 - nm gold particles ) . Cells that had internalized B - fragment at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C were then shifted for 2 min ( B ) , 10 min ( C—D ) , and 30 min ( E ) to 37 (cid:56) C . Cryosections were stained for B - fragment ( 10 - nm gold particles in B , C , and E ; 15 - nm gold particles in D ) and MPR46 ( 15 - nm gold particles in B ; 10 - nm gold particles in D ) . Cryosections that were doubled stained for MPR46 ( in B and D ) showed that the B - fragment entered the Golgi apparatus via the TGN . Bars , 100 nm . Mallard et al . Direct B - fragment Early Endosome to Golgi Transport 979 ments that contained the green fluorescent protein—tagged Golgi marker Rab6 ( not shown ) . Quantification of experi - ments as those of Fig . 3 A showed that the B - fragment moved with a t 1 / 2 of 19 min from EE / RE to the Golgi appa - ratus ( Fig . 3 B ) . The plateau value of the Golgi over cell - ratio of 3 . 97 in Fig . 3 B corresponded to 32 . 1 % ( (cid:54) 2 . 6 % ; n (cid:53) 8 ) of total cell - associated B - fragment—specific labeling being concentrated in the Golgi area . It should be pointed out that at later time points , this value likely reflected a steady - state concentration of B - fragment in the Golgi ap - paratus as we have previously shown that in the absence of an ectopic ER retrieval signal , B - fragment distributed be - tween the Golgi apparatus and the ER ( Johannes et al . , 1997 ) . Protein sulfation is a TGN - specific posttranslational modification that is catalyzed by sulfotransferase . We have previously shown that B - fragment with a COOH - terminal sulfation site and a KDEL signal can be sulfated ( Jo - hannes et al . , 1997 ) . Here we constructed a new mutant without retrieval signal and with a tandem of sulfation sites to increase sensitivity . This mutant , termed B - ( Sulf ) 2 , was internalized into HeLa cells for 1 h at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , and the cells were then shifted to 37 (cid:56) C , as indicated in Fig . 3 C . At the end of the incubation periods , radioactive sulfate was added for 15 min to the cells to sample the amount of B - ( Sulf ) 2 that was in the TGN at this time point . The peak value for sulfation on B - ( Sulf ) 2 was obtained between 15 and 30 min ( Fig . 3 C ) . During the 60—75 - min interval , the Figure 3 . Kinetics of B - fragment transport from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus . ( A ) Confocal microscopy on living HeLa cells . Fluoro - phore - labeled B - fragment was internalized for 1 h into HeLa cells at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , upon which the cells were transferred to the stage of a con - focal microscope and incubated at 37 (cid:56) C . Digital images ( four integration frames ) were acquired at the indicated time points . Note that after 4 min , B - fragment was detected in peripheral structures , and then later concentrated in the perinuclear region . ( B ) Images as shown in A were quantified , and the fraction of average Golgi associated fluorescence over average total cell - associated fluorescence is represented in function of incubation time at 37 (cid:56) C . The means ( (cid:54) SE ) of eight experiments are shown . The curve was fitted to f ( x ) (cid:53) 1 (cid:49) 2 . 97 [ 1 (cid:50) exp ( (cid:50) 0 . 036 (cid:51) ) ] , r (cid:53) 0 . 9979 . ( C ) Sulfation analysis . B - ( Sulf ) 2 was internalized into HeLa cells at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , and the cells were then shifted to 37 (cid:56) C . After 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 , and 90 min , radioactive sulfate was added for 15 min . Note that B - ( Sulf ) 2 is at its peak concentra - tion in the TGN during the 15—30 min interval . A representative of 2 experiments is shown . In each experiment , the data points were ob - tained in duplicate . ( D ) Cotransport of B - fragment and Tf in living cells . For the points 3 and 10 min at 37 (cid:56) C , fluorophore - coupled B - fragment and fluorophore - coupled Tf were internalized as described in A . For the point 30 min at 37 (cid:56) C , B - fragment alone was inter - nalized continuously at 37 (cid:56) C , cells were then fixed and stained for the TfR . Note that the B - fragment concentrated in the Golgi area ( large arrow at 10 min ) , while remaining cytoplasmic B - fragment—containing structures always were Tf ( 4 and 10 min ) or TfR ( 30 min ) positive ( small arrows at 30 min ) . Single optical slices were obtained by confocal microscopy . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 980 amount of sulfated B - ( Sulf ) 2 decreased to 25 % of the peak value , and then remained stable when sampled after 90— 105 min ( Fig . 3 C ) or after 4 h ( not shown ) . Likely , this residual material accessible to sulfation represents the steady state amount of B - ( Sulf ) 2 in the TGN . In summary , the kinetics obtained by morphological and biochemical means were comparable , and both experiments confirmed the hypothesis of rapid B - fragment transport from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus . The possibility to follow transport of fluorophor - labeled proteins on living cells by confocal microscopy then al - lowed to compare the exit of B - fragment and Tf from EE / RE . As shown in Fig . 3 D ( left ) , 3 min after transfer to 37 (cid:56) C both proteins still largely colocalized to dispersed cy - toplasmic structures . After 10 min at 37 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 3 D , mid - dle ) , B - fragment began to accumulate in the Golgi appara - tus ( large arrow ; note that the plane of focus is not on the Golgi apparatus ) , while Tf staining had visibly diminished ( the Tf image at 10 min was overexposed to compensate for loss resulting from recycling ) . However , it should be noted that the vesicular structures that remained B - frag - ment labeled also still contained Tf . After longer in - cubations at 37 (cid:56) C , Tf was recycled to the medium and the B - fragment regrouped in the Golgi apparatus ( not shown ) . To label B - fragment—containing intermediate structures after longer periods of time , HeLa cells were incubated continuously for 30 min in the presence of Cy3 - tagged B - fragment at 37 (cid:56) C , fixed , and then labeled for TfR ( Fig . 3 D , right ) . In agreement with the data in vivo it was found that all B - fragment—labeled structures outside the Golgi apparatus were also positive for the TfR ( Fig . 3 D , small arrows ) . The presence of B - fragment in EE / RE in colocalization with Tf prompted us to test whether internalized B - frag - ment could be recycled to the plasma membrane , as de - scribed for other toxins ( Sandvig and Olsnes , 1979 ; Nambiar and Wu , 1995 ; Alami et al . , 1998 ) . FITC - tagged B - fragment was internalized into HeLa cells at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C for 45 min . The cells were then put on ice and B - fragment that was still exposed at the cell surface was reacted with an anti - FITC antibody that quenched FITC fluorescence upon interaction with the fluorophore . The cells were sub - sequently transferred to 37 (cid:56) C in the continued presence of the anti - FITC antibody in the extracellular medium . It was found that 25 % of FITC fluorescence that was emitted by intracellular B - fragments was quenched during a 30 - min incubation at 37 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 4 ) . This value did not increase any more upon 50 additional min at 37 (cid:56) C in the presence of the anti - FITC antibody . 25 % or 80 % of total quenching was already obtained after 5 or 15 min at 37 (cid:56) C , respectively , in - dicating that B - fragment recycling to the plasma mem - brane was rapid . It can be concluded that only (cid:122) 25 % of internalized B - fragment was recycled to the plasma mem - brane during an incubation period ( 80 min ; Fig . 4 ) suffi - ciently long to have B - fragment at its peak concentration in the Golgi apparatus ( Fig . 3 ) . It should be added that fol - lowing B - fragment internalization at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C and subse - quent incubation at 37 (cid:56) C for 5—30 min , surface biotinyla - tion studies failed to detect a significant increase in plasma membrane—associated B - fragment , consistent with the hy - pothesis of little B - fragment being recycled to the plasma membrane ( not shown ) . The observation of limited recy - cling of B - fragment is also consistent with earlier studies that showed that plasma membrane associated Shiga toxin became rapidly insensitive to the neutralizing activity of anti - toxin antibody ( Sandvig et al . , 1989 ) . B - fragment thus passed with a half time of 19 min from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus with part of the molecules being recycled to the plasma membrane . The absence of B - fragment—positive structures outside the Golgi appara - tus that would have been devoid of Tf or TfR suggested that the B - fragment did not accumulate outside EE / RE on its transport to the Golgi apparatus . Upon Transport to the Golgi Apparatus , B - fragment Does Not Accumulate in Organelles of the Late Endocytic Pathway To directly test whether B - fragment had access to com - partments of the late endocytic pathway while moving from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus , HeLa cells were incu - bated for 1 h with BSA coupled to gold particles ( BSA - gold ) and B - fragment at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , and then fixed either di - rectly ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) or shifted for 15 min to 37 (cid:56) C before fixation ( Fig . 5 C ) . The cells were then prepared for cryo - ultramicrotomy and cryosections were labeled with the in - dicated antibodies . Upon incubation at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) , BSA - gold ( 5 - nm gold particles ) was found filling tubular and vesicular elements that also contained B - frag - ment ( 10 - nm gold particles ) . In addition , strong BSA - gold accumulation was observed in large compartments ( 150— 300 nm ) that were devoid of B - fragment ( Fig . 5 B , arrow ) . At 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , B - fragment thus seemed to partition away from the bulk fluid phase , as described above ( Fig . 1 E ) . We also noted that during low temperature incubation , no BSA - gold advanced to multivesicular or multilamellar late endosomes ( not shown ) , demonstrating that transport to the late endocytic pathway was inhibited at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C ( see also below ) . To have quantitative data on the evolution of B - frag - ment staining with respect to that of lysosome - bound BSA - gold , we compared the percentage of B - fragment— positive , BSA - gold—containing structures after the 19 . 5 (cid:56) C incubation to the percentage of such structures observed after the additional 15 min shift to 37 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 5 D ) . At 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , 76 . 9 % of BSA - gold—positive endosomes also con - tained B - fragment , whereas after 15 min at 37 (cid:56) C ( for ex - ample Fig . 5 C ) , only 16 . 7 % of such double - labeled struc - dicated periods . Fluorescence at each time point was determined as described in Materials and Methods and compared with the 0 time point to determine quenching due to newly recycled B - frag - ment . The means ( (cid:54) SE ) for three independent experiments are shown . Figure 4 . A fraction of inter - nalized B - fragment is recy - cled to the plasma membrane .

( A and B ) HeLa cells were incubated with B - fragment and BSA - gold ( 5 - nm gold particles ) at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C . Cryosections were stained with anti—B - frag - ment antibody ( 10 - nm gold particles ) . The arrow in B indicates a region of high BSA - gold concentration ( bulk fluid phase ) that is de - void of B - fragment . ( C ) Cells treated as in A and B were then shifted for 15 min to 37 (cid:56) C , fixed , and then cryosections were stained with anti—B - fragment antibody ( 15 - nm gold particles ) and anti—CI - MPR antibody ( 10 - nm gold particles ) .

In Fig . 5 C we also show that the B - frag - ment ( 15 - nm gold particles ) had left EE after the 15 - min incubation at 37 (cid:56) C , while these were still stained with BSA - gold ( areas 1 ) . The B - fragment had entered the Golgi apparatus ( Fig . 5 C , GA , arrows ) , as described The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 982 above . Importantly , the toxin subunit was neither detected in multivesicular LE that were already loaded with BSA - gold ( 5 - nm gold particles ) ( areas 2 ) , nor was it found mul - tilamellar ( mature ) LE ( areas 3 ) . These structures were labeled with antibodies to the CI - MPR ( 10 - nm gold parti - cles ) , which , in contrast to MPR46 , is mostly localized in LE in HeLa cells ( not shown ; see above ) . Even after staining cryosections for only B - fragment in the absence of BSA - gold ( experiments described in Fig . 2 ) , structures with a characteristic morphology of multive - sicular and multilamellar late endosomes were frequently observed . However , neither after the 19 . 5 (cid:56) C block nor during subsequent incubations ( 2 , 10 , 30 min ) at 37 (cid:56) C , any B - fragment was detected in these structures ( not shown ) . These direct observations and the quantification described above thus suggest that the B - fragment did not accumu - late in compartments of the late endocytic pathway upon its transfer from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus . Figure 6 . Drug effects on B - fragment transport to the Golgi apparatus . HeLa cells were incubated with fluo - rophore - labeled B - fragment for 1 h at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , before being shifted to 37 (cid:56) C ( A ) in the absence ( CTL ) or presence of 1 (cid:109) M Bafi or 1 (cid:109) M CytoD , or ( B ) in the presence of 5 (cid:109) g / ml BFA . The cells were then fixed and labeled with CTR433 antibody ( A ) or anti - TfR antibody ( B ) . ( C ) BFA inhibits B - fragment transport to dispersed Golgi cisternae in Noc - treated HeLa cells . HeLa cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10 (cid:109) M Noc . The cells were then transferred on ice and incubated with fluo - rophore - labeled B - fragment for 30 min , washed , and then shifted for 30 min to 37 (cid:56) C in the absence ( top row ) or pres - ence ( bottom row ) of 5 (cid:109) g / ml BFA and in the continued presence of Noc . The cells were then fixed and stained for the Golgi marker CTR433 . Note that in the ab - sence of BFA , B - fragment as - sociated with the dispersed cisternae of the Golgi appara - tus ( top ) , while in the pres - ence of the drug , the CTR433 - positive cisternae were devoid of B - fragment ( bottom ) . Four optical slices were obtained by confocal microscopy . Mallard et al . Direct B - fragment Early Endosome to Golgi Transport 983 Drug Effects on B - fragment Transport To test the influence of drugs with established effects on the endocytic pathway on B - fragment transport to the Golgi apparatus , cells that had internalized Cy3 - labeled B - fragment at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C were incubated for 1 h at 37 (cid:56) C in presence of the vacuolar proton pump inhibitor bafilomy - cin A 1 ( Bafi ) , the actin - depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) , or the fungal metabolite brefeldin A ( BFA ) ( Fig . 6 ) . Neither CytoD nor Bafi prevented B - fragment appearance in the Golgi apparatus , stained with the me - dial Golgi marker CTR433 ( Fig . 6 A ) , consistent with re - cently published observations ( Schapiro et al . , 1998 ) . The same results were obtained when the cells were pretreated for up to 2 h with these drugs ( not shown ) . In the presence of BFA , which in addition to its profound effects on the biosynthetic / secretory pathway ( for review see Klausner et al . , 1992 ) has somewhat more subtle effects on the en - docytic membrane system ( Hunziker et al . , 1991 ; Lippin - cott - Schwartz et al . , 1991 ; Wood et al . , 1991 ; Strous et al . , 1993 ; for review see Hunziker et al . , 1992 ) , B - fragment ac - cumulated in tubular elements that also contained the TfR ( Fig . 6 B ) . The protein remained associated with these tu - bules even when the cells were incubated at 37 (cid:56) C for up to 4 h in presence of the drug ( not shown ) . In the presence of the microtubule - destabilizing agent nocodazole ( Noc ) , B - fragment was still transported to the dispersed cisternae of the Golgi apparatus where it colocalized with the Golgi marker CTR433 ( Fig . 6 C , top row ; see also Johannes et al . , 1997 ) and with the TGN marker protein TGN38 ( not shown ) . Interestingly , when Noc - treated cells were also exposed to BFA , CTR433 - positive ( Fig . 6 C , bottom row ) Golgi compartments that persisted under these conditions ( Lippincott - Schwartz et al . , 1990 ) were not labeled by B - fragment any more , suggesting that transport between the BFA - induced , B - fragment - , and TfR - positive mem - brane system and the Golgi remnants had ceased . To obtain quantitative data on drug effects on B - frag - ment transport , we used a previously constructed chimeric B - fragment in which the B - fragment was fused to a N - gly - cosylation site and the KDEL retrieval signal , yielding a protein termed B - Glyc - KDEL ( Johannes et al . , 1997 ) . As wild - type B - fragment , B - Glyc - KDEL is transported from the plasma membrane to the ER , where the chimeric pro - tein gets progressively glycosylated . The determination of the percentage of glycosylated , cell - associated B - Glyc - KDEL at any given time point after internalization repre - sents thus a quantitative measure for the protein(cid:213)s trans - port to the ER . Fig . 7 A shows the results of glycosylation analysis on B - Glyc - KDEL , which was incubated with HeLa cells in the presence of drugs . Control cells ( Fig . 7 A , closed circles ) and cells that had been pretreated for 2 h with Bafi ( open squares ) or CytoD ( open diamonds ) and that had bound iodinated B - Glyc - KDEL on ice were shifted to 37 (cid:56) C in the continued presence of the drugs . BFA ( Fig . 7 A , closed diamonds ) was only added upon temperature shift to 37 (cid:56) C . Cell lysates taken after the indi - cated times at 37 (cid:56) C were analyzed by autoradiography . Bafi and CytoD had no effect on B - Glyc - KDEL glycosyla - tion ( Fig . 7 A ) . The same results were obtained when cells were incubated in the presence of the proton pump inhibi - tor concanamycin B , the weak base ammonium chloride or when Bafi treatment was combined with chloroquine treatment , the weak base chloroquine assuring a rapid dis - sipation of endosomal pH ( not shown ) . In contrast , no gly - cosylation of B - Glyc - KDEL was detectable in the pres - ence of BFA ( Fig . 7 A , closed diamonds ) , even after incubations of (cid:35) 15 h ( not shown ) . In parallel , we analyzed the lysosomal degradation of EGF as a control for the efficiency of the drug treatments ( Fig . 7 B ) . Iodinated EGF was internalized into HeLa cells at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C . To test whether the block at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C prevented access to lysosomes , cells were incubated for (cid:35) 8 h with ra - diolabled EGF at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C . The number of TCA - soluble counts remained stable under these conditions ( not shown ) , indicating that EGF was not transferred to a degradative ( late ) compartment of the endocytic pathway . The cells that had internalized EGF at low temperatures were then shifted to 37 (cid:56) C . In the absence of the drugs ( Fig . 7 B , closed circles ) , EGF degradation was complete after 90 min . As expected , Bafi ( Fig . 7 B , open squares ) almost completely inhibited degradation , as judged from the fact that the amount of extracellular TCA - soluble material de - rived from EGF remained stable . CytoD induced a delay Figure 7 . Quantification of drug effects on B - fragment transport to the biosynthetic / secretory pathway . ( A ) HeLa cells were preincubated 2 h with 1 (cid:109) M Bafi ( open squares ) and 1 (cid:109) M CytoD ( open diamonds ) . The cells were then transferred on ice and incubated with 50 nM io - dinated B - Glyc - KDEL for 30 min . After washing , the cells were shifted to 37 (cid:56) C in the continued presence of the drugs . BFA ( closed dia - monds ) was added only upon temperature shift to 37 (cid:56) C . Control cells ( closed circles ) were not treated with drugs . After the indicated times at 37 (cid:56) C , cells were lysed in sam - ple buffer , and then lysates were analyzed on 10—20 % polyacrylamide—SDS gradi - ent gels , followed by autora - diography . The percentage of glycosylated B - Glyc - KDEL was expressed in function of incubation time . The means of three independent experiments ( (cid:54) SE ) are shown .

The cells were then shifted to 37 (cid:56) C , and 5 (cid:109) g / ml BFA was added after the indicated times ( (cid:50) 30 min to 4 h , with respect to the beginning of B - Glyc - KDEL internalization ) . After 4 h at 37 (cid:56) C , cells were lysed and glycosylated B - Glyc - KDEL was determined as described in A . A representative of two experiments is shown . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 984 in EGF degradation ( Fig . 7 B , open circles ) , consistent with its proposed effect on transport to lysosomes ( Durr - bach et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , despite its morphological ef - fects ( Fig . 6 B ) , BFA did not affect EGF degradation in ly - sosomes ( Fig . 7 B , open diamonds ) , consistent with a study by Stoorvogel et al . ( 1993 ) that showed no significant inhi - bition by BFA of protein transport to lysosomes and lyso - somal degradation . B - fragment transport to the Golgi apparatus and to the ER thus seemed to be independent of the maintenance of an acidic environment in endosomes and independent of the actin cytoskeleton . In contrast , BFA induced the accu - mulation of the B - fragment in a tubular membrane com - partment that contained the TfR , and inhibited B - Glyc - KDEL transport to the ER and B - fragment transport to Golgi remnants in Noc - treated cells . In this context it should be mentioned that we have pre - viously reported that in HeLa cells , radiolabeled B - frag - ment is not transformed into TCA soluble material ( Jo - hannes et al . , 1997 ) , suggesting that in these cells the protein is not transported to lysosomes , an observation which is consistent with the absence of colocalization with lysosomal marker proteins ( Johannes et al . , 1997 ) , and with the absence of the protein from heavy fractions on Percoll gradients ( not shown ) . Here we observed that dur - ing incubations of radiolabeled B - fragment with HeLa cells for (cid:35) 6 h in the presence of BFA , no TCA - precipita - ble counts appeared in the medium ( not shown ) . Thus , even when its exit from the endosomal membrane system was blocked by BFA ( see above ) , B - fragment did not (cid:210)dif - fuse(cid:211) to degradative ( late ) compartments of the endocytic pathway , despite that this transport route was still open for other proteins , e . g . , EGF . In another experiment , BFA was added at various times after the initiation of B - Glyc - KDEL internalization from the plasma membrane by temperature shift to 37 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 7 C ) . It was found that when added after 90 min , the drug no longer had an effect on glycosylation . The t 1 / 2 of inhibition was 30 min ( Fig . 7 C ) , in good agreement with the above described kinetics of B - fragment transport from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus ( see Fig . 3 B ; note that in Fig . 7 C , transport is sampled from the plasma membrane ) . These data thus suggest a correlation between B - fragment trans - port from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus and the passage of the BFA - sensitive transport step . B - fragment Colocalizes with (cid:103) - Adaptin on Membranes of Early / Recycling Endosomes The BFA - induced inhibition of B - fragment exit from TfR - positive membrane compartments suggested that ADP ri - bosylation factor—sensitive vesicular coats could play a role in this process ( Donaldson et al . , 1992 ; Helms and Rothman , 1992 ) . We thus set out to study the distribution of vesicular coat proteins on endosomes . Different vesicu - lar coats have been localized on endosomes , among the best studied are coatomer type I—like coats and clathrin coats ( Louvard et al . , 1983 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ; Whitney et al . , 1995 ; Aniento et al . , 1996 ; Stoorvogel et al . , 1996 ; Daro et al . , 1997 ; Gu et al . , 1997 ) . We here made the observation that during a 1 - h incubation at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , a component of AP - 1— type clathrin coats , (cid:103) - adaptin , was shifted from its localiza - tion at steady state in the TGN to B - fragment containing EE / RE ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . If the cells were then incubated at 37 (cid:56) C for 10 min ( not shown ) or 30 min ( Fig . 8 , C and D ) , (cid:103) - adaptin reassociated with TGN membranes while the B - fragment accumulated in the TGN / Golgi apparatus . Cryosections of cells that had internalized B - fragment and BSA - gold at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C and that were then shifted for var - ious times to 37 (cid:56) C , were labeled with anti— (cid:103) - adaptin and anti—B - fragment antibodies . At 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , B - fragment ( 15 - nm gold particles ) and (cid:103) - adaptin ( 10 - nm gold particles ) were found on the same coated membrane profiles ( 50—80 nm ) ( Fig . 9 , A—C , arrowheads ) . The B - fragment and (cid:103) - adaptin— labeled structures sometimes were connected with endo - somal membranes ( Fig . 9 , B and C ) , while in other in - stances seemingly free vesicles could be detected that may represent membrane buds that were cut perpendicularly ( Fig . 9 , A—C ) . In some cases , B - fragment—positive profiles were devoid of (cid:103) - adaptin , and vice versa ( Fig . 9 , B and C ) . In the same experiments it was noted that strongly BSA - gold—positive structures ( bulk fluid phase ) were devoid of (cid:103) - adaptin staining ( not shown ) , suggesting that (cid:103) - adaptin localization on subdomains of EE / RE at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C was a spe - cific event . Investigations using antibodies to clathrin ( 10 - nm gold particles ) combined with B - fragment ( 15 - nm gold particles ) labeling were also carried out on the experiment described above ( Fig . 9 , D and E ) . Again , membrane pro - files stained with both antibodies ( Fig . 9 , D and E , arrows ) were observed . As described above , B - fragment colocalized extensively Figure 8 . At 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , the (cid:103) - adaptin subunit of AP - 1—type clath - rin coats is relocalized from the TGN to EE / RE . Fluorophore - labeled B - fragment ( A and C ) was internalized for 1 h into HeLa cells at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C . The cells were then either fixed directly ( A and B ) , or shifted for 30 min to 37 (cid:56) C ( C and D ) before fixation and staining for (cid:103) - adaptin ( B and D ) . Note that at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , (cid:103) - adaptin and B - fragment colocalized on EE / RE ( A and B ) , and after shift to 37 (cid:56) C , (cid:103) - adaptin was relocalized to the TGN , in parallel with B - fragment accumulation in Golgi cisternae ( C and D ) . Mallard et al . Direct B - fragment Early Endosome to Golgi Transport 985 with Tf if incubated with HeLa cells at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C ( see Fig . 1 ) . We therefore investigated whether both molecules would also be found together in (cid:103) - adaptin / clathrin—coated mem - brane profiles . HeLa cells were incubated with B - fragment and Tf coupled to HRP ( Tf - HRP ) at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C for 1 h . Tf - HRP , which is transported as Tf ( see for example Stoorvo - gel et al . , 1996 ) , was chosen since good anti - HRP antibod - ies exist . Cryosections from these cells were triple - labeled for B - fragment ( 15 - nm gold particles ) , Tf - HRP ( 10 - nm gold particles ) , and (cid:103) - adaptin ( 5 - nm gold particles ) ( Fig . 9 , F—I ) . Again , B - fragment was found in colocalization with (cid:103) - adaptin , and some of the (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane profiles were also labeled for Tf - HRP , while in other cases triple - labeled profiles were detected ( Fig . 9 , F—I , ar - rowheads ) . Quantification of double - and triple - labeled sections showed that 9 . 7 % of total internalized B - frag - ment and 13 . 2 % of total internalized Tf - HRP colocalized with (cid:103) - adaptin ( Table I ) . Despite their comparable presence in (cid:103) - adaptin positive structures , B - fragment and Tf - HRP were found to have significantly different distributions in these structures ( Fig . 10 ) . Most B - fragment gold particles that colocalized with (cid:103) - adaptin were found in structures that were not labeled for Tf - HRP ( 66 % ) , while in the case of Tf - HRP most gold particles that colocalized with (cid:103) - adap - tin were found in triple labeled structures ( 58 % ) ( Fig . 10 A ) . The same differences were observed when (cid:103) - adaptin— positive structures were analyzed for the presence or ab - sence of B - fragment or Tf - HRP ( Fig . 10 B ) . Significantly more (cid:103) - adaptin—positive structures were labeled for only B - fragment ( 30 % ) , when compared with (cid:103) - adaptin—posi - tive structures labeled for Tf - HRP only ( 17 . 1 % ) . In contrast to B - fragment and Tf - HRP , only a small per - centage of internalized BSA - gold was present in (cid:103) - adap - tin—positive structures ( 0 . 27 % ) ( Table I ) , consistent with earlier studies which showed that fluid phase is basically excluded from transport to the Golgi apparatus ( see Sand - Figure 9 . (cid:103) - Adaptin and clathrin colocalize with B - fragment and Tf - HRP at the ultrastructural level on coated membrane profiles of EE / RE . ( A—E ) HeLa cells were incubated for 1 h with B - fragment and BSA - gold ( 5 - nm gold particles ) at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C . Cryosections of these cells were labeled with anti—B - fragment antibody ( 15 - nm gold particles ) and anti— (cid:103) - adaptin antibody ( 10 - nm gold particles in A — C ) or anti - clathrin antibody ( 10 - nm gold particles in D and E ) . In A—C , arrowheads indicate regions of colocalization between (cid:103) - adaptin and B - fragment . In D and E , arrowheads point out regions of colocalization between clathrin and B - fragment . ( F - I ) Serum - starved HeLa cells were incubated for 1 h with B - fragment and Tf - HRP at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C . Cryosections of these cells were labeled with anti—B - fragment anti - body ( 15 - nm gold particles ) , anti - HRP antibody ( 10 - nm gold particles ) , and anti— (cid:103) - adaptin antibody ( 5 - nm gold particles ) . Arrowheads in F and G point to double - or triple - labeled profiles . ( H and I ) Magnification of selected structures . Bars , 100 nm . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 986 vig et al . , 1994 and references therein ) , and that even at 37 (cid:56) C only a small fraction of fluid phase is recycled ( Goud et al . , 1984 ) . TGN38 and the B - fragment Colocalize during Transport to the Golgi Apparatus To test whether a cellular protein could follow the same route as the B - fragment , B - fragment was incubated at 37 (cid:56) C with HeLa cells in the presence of antibodies di - rected either to the CI - MPR or to rat TGN38 ( Fig . 11 ) . The CI - MPR and TGN38 both cycle between endosomes and the TGN ( Humphrey et al . , 1993 ; Reaves et al . , 1993 ; Chapman and Munro , 1994 ; Ponnambalam et al . , 1994 ; Munier - Lehmann et al . , 1996 ) . The antibodies were added at concentrations at which fluid phase internalization was not detectable ( see Materials and Methods ) . After increas - ing periods of time , the cells were washed , fixed , and then processed for immunofluorescence . At 10 min , colabeling was found for TGN38 and B - fragment in vesicular struc - tures at the level of EE of rat TGN38 - expressing HeLa cells ( Fig . 11 A , top row ) . After 30 min ( not shown ) or 60 min at 37 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 11 A , bottom row ) , both proteins arrived in the Golgi apparatus . They labeled overlapping struc - tures with subtle differences that may have resulted from B - fragment transport into the cisternae of the Golgi appa - ratus , while TGN38 remained confined to the TGN . In ac - cordance with the hypothesis that TGN38 and the B - frag - ment could both follow the same route from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus it was also observed that after BFA treat - ment , both proteins were found in tubular elements ( not shown ) . The internalized anti—CI - MPR antibody gave a dis - tinctly different staining pattern than B - fragment . After 30 min ( Fig . 11 B , top row ) 1 h , 2 h ( not shown ) , or 4 h ( Fig . 11 B , bottom row ) at 37 (cid:56) C , the antibody labeled vesicular elements that ( especially after longer incubation ) were concentrated in the perinuclear region consistent with LE or Golgi localization . At none of the analyzed time points , CI - MPR labeling and B - fragment—positive structures over - lapped to a significant extend . These data thus suggest that B - fragment may be transported via the same pathway as TGN38 from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus , while the CI - MPR may use a different transport route . Discussion In this study , we raised the question as to how Shiga toxin B - fragment is transported from the endocytic compart - ment to the Golgi apparatus . Our data suggest that B - frag - ment passes directly from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus , circumventing the late endocytic pathway , and that in this basically unexplored transport route , B - fragment sorting at the level of EE / RE implicates AP - 1—type clathrin coats . Shiga Toxin B - fragment Transport from EE / RE to the Golgi Apparatus To characterize the pathway followed by B - fragment be - tween EE / RE and the Golgi apparatus , we took advantage of our finding that a temperature block at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C allowed a synchronization of B - fragment transport at the level of EE / RE . Using this temperature block protocol and subse - quent shift to 37 (cid:56) C , the following observations were made that support the hypothesis of the existence of a direct transport pathway between EE / RE and the Golgi appara - tus . First , at low temperature incubations , B - fragment was segregated from markers that were bound for LE and ly - sosomes , such as EGF , even if cells were incubated for prolonged periods . If the B - fragment was destined for the late endocytic pathway , one would have expected an accu - mulation at the entry site of this pathway , i . e . , structures that were stained by EGF . Second , upon incubation at low temperatures , the fluid phase marker BSA - gold filled the membranes of EE , where it colocalized with cointernal - ized B - fragment . However , upon subsequent shift to 37 (cid:56) C , both markers efficiently separated when the bulk of BSA - gold was transferred to the late endocytic pathway , while the B - fragment was transported to the Golgi apparatus . Third , as judged from light microscopical studies , all cyto - plasmic B - fragment containing structures also remained TfR positive , suggesting that on its transport to the Golgi apparatus , B - fragment did not accumulate outside EE . Figure 10 . Quantification of (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane pro - files .

The columns represent the fraction of B - fragment ( lanes 1 and 2 ) in (cid:103) - adaptin— positive structures that were labeled ( lane 2 ) or not labeled ( lane 1 ) for Tf - HRP , or the fraction of Tf - HRP ( lanes 3 and 4 ) in (cid:103) - adaptin—positive structures that were labeled ( lane 4 ) or not labeled ( lane 3 ) for B - fragment . ( B ) Characterization of (cid:103) - adap - tin—positive structures . Note that significantly more (cid:103) - adaptin— positive profiles were labeled for only B - fragment ( left column ) , compared with such structures labeled for only Tf - HRP ( right column ) . * and * * , direct comparison shows that these conditions are significantly different ( P (cid:44) 0 . 01 ; see Materials and Methods ) . Mallard et al . Direct B - fragment Early Endosome to Golgi Transport 987 Electron microscopical observations further supported the idea of a direct transport route as B - fragment was not de - tected in multivesicular or multilamellar LE at any time point . Fourth , we show that after as little as 2 min at 37 (cid:56) C after the temperature block , B - fragment could be detected in the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus , which became strongly labeled after 10 min . This rapid kinetics is consis - tent with a direct passage from EE / RE to the Golgi appa - ratus . Fifth , the data presented in Fig . 3 B were fitted to an exponential raise curve with a time constant of 0 . 036 min (cid:50) 1 , indicating the existence of a single rate - limiting step in EE / RE - to - Golgi transport . This observation is most easily explained if EE / RE derived transport interme - diates fuse directly with the Golgi apparatus as acceptor compartment , without passing through other compart - ments . Sixth , drugs such as CytoD , ConB , Bafi , chloro - quine , and ammonium chloride , with defined effects on the late endocytic pathway did not interfere with B - frag - ment transport to the Golgi apparatus and the ER . Par - ticularly for the pH neutralizing drugs , an inhibition of Figure 11 . B - fragment and anti - TGN38 , but not anti—CI - MPR , are found in the same structures . ( A ) Fluorophore - labeled B - fragment ( left ) and anti - TGN38 antibody ( right ) were bound to HeLa C7 cells on ice , upon which the cells were incubated at 37 (cid:56) C for 10 min ( top ) and 60 min ( bottom ) in the continued presence of both pro - teins . The cells were then fixed and stained for internalized anti - TGN38 antibody ( right ) . ( B ) Fluorophore - labeled B - fragment ( left ) and anti— CI - MPR antibody ( right ) were bound to HeLa cells on ice , upon which the cells were incubated at 37 (cid:56) C for 30 min ( top ) and 4 h ( bottom ) in the continued presence of both proteins . The cells were then fixed and stained for internalized anti— CI - MPR antibody ( right ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 988 the formation of LE - bound endosomal carrier vesicles ( Clague et al . , 1994 ; Aniento et al . , 1996 ) and an inhibition of transport from LE to lysosomes ( Benaroch et al . , 1995 ; van Weert et al . , 1995 ) has been described . Seventh , BFA was found to induce B - fragment accumulation in TfR - con - taining membrane tubules and also inhibited B - fragment transport to the ER . Strikingly , no B - fragment degra - dation ( appearance of TCA - soluble material ) became ap - parent , even after prolonged incubations at 37 (cid:56) C in the presence of BFA , whereas the transport route to LE / lyso - somes was still open for other proteins ( e . g . , EGF ) , thus strongly suggesting that the B - fragment did not access late ( degradative ) compartments of the endocytic pathway . In addition , if LE were the exit point for B - fragment trans - port to the Golgi apparatus , one would have expected that in the presence of BFA , the protein would have accumu - lated in this compartment . The existence of a direct transport route between EE / RE and the TGN was first suggested in studies showing that small quantities of internalized Tf could be detected in the TGN ( Fishman and Fine , 1987 ; Stoorvogel et al . , 1988 ) . Our hypothesis that protein toxins such as Shiga toxin may use this route is consistent with studies by Balch and col - leagues ( Simpson et al . , 1995 ) who showed that another toxin , the plant toxin ricin , seemed to reach the Golgi appa - ratus even in cells that expressed a dominant - negative mu - tant of the small GTP - binding protein Rab9 . Rab9 localizes to late endosomes and to the TGN and regulates transport of the CI - MPR , presumably from LE to the TGN ( Lom - bardi et al . , 1993 ; Riederer et al . , 1994 ) . One would thus have expected an effect of the dominant - negative mutant of Rab9 on ricin transport if this transport passed via LE . The proposed B - fragment pathway from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus may be shared by cellular proteins . We found that TGN38 colocalized with B - fragment during its transport to the TGN , and both , B - fragment and TGN38 distributions in cells were affected in the same way by BFA treatment . In addition , the kinetics of B - fragment and TGN38 transport to the Golgi apparatus were compa - rable . In agreement with these data , the group of F . R . Maxfield ( Cornell University Medical College , New York ) recently showed that an epitope - tagged version of TGN38 ( Humphrey et al . , 1993 ) is transported with a t 1 / 2 of 45 min from the plasma membrane to the TGN in CHO cells , with first TGN38 - label appearing in the TGN after only 10 min ( see Note Added in Proof ) . Such kinetics compares well with the t 1 / 2 of 19 min determined in this study for B - frag - ment transport from EE / RE to the TGN / Golgi apparatus , especially when it is considered that 80 % of internalized TGN38 were recycled to the plasma membrane , thus in - ducing a delay with respect to Golgi transport . In contrast to TGN38 , there was little colocalization between the CI - MPR and B - fragment in endosomes . These data suggest that the CI - MPR may follow a different transport route from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus , e . g . , from LE . In this context it should also be added that the kinetics of B - fragment and CI - MPR transport to the TGN appears to be quite different . Whereas the t 1 / 2 for B - fragment is 19 min , resialylation in the TGN of CI - MPR that has been desialylated at the plasma membrane ( thus sampling plasma membrane to TGN transport ) occurs with a t 1 / 2 of 1—2 h ( Jin et al . , 1989 ) . The suggestion of a common pathway for both , B - frag - ment and TGN38 is in apparent contradiction with the fact that B - fragment transport to the Golgi apparatus ( and the ER ) is not affected by chemicals that raise endosomal and Golgi pH , while TGN38 has been reported to be retained in endosomes under similar conditions ( Chapman and Munro , 1994 ; Reaves and Banting , 1994 a ) . It is possible that the transmembrane protein TGN38 relies on a sorting mechanism for Golgi transport whose activity is sensitive to luminal pH changes , while the glycolipid binding B - frag - ment would follow the flow of lipids which may be gov - erned by different ( pH insensitive ) mechanisms , such as sorting into specialized environments in endosomes , as sug - gested for GPI - anchored proteins ( Maxfield and Mayor , 1997 ) . It should also be mentioned that on HeLa cells transfected with rat TGN38 , we did not detect a major ef - fect of Bafi and combined Bafi and chloroquine treat - ments on anti - TGN38 transport to the TGN ( not shown ) . This divergence with the above mentioned studies ( Chap - man and Munro , 1994 ; Reaves and Banting , 1994 a ) may be attributed to cell type differences . Sorting of B - fragment into Golgi Transport Intermediates Another important finding of this study is the observation that during incubation at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C , B - fragment and EGF were localized to juxtaposed structures suggesting that both proteins partitioned into separate compartments or into subdomains of the same compartment , i . e . , sorting en - dosomes . In fact , it has been proposed that sorting at the level of sorting endosomes may occur through the forma - tion of subdomains with high or low membrane - to - volume ratios ( Geuze et al . , 1983 , 1987 ) , the former being of tubu - lar morphology and enriched in proteins and lipids des - tined for the recycling pathway , while the latter are of ve - sicular morphology and enriched in proteins and lipids destined for the late endosomal pathway ( for review see Gruenberg and Maxfield , 1995 ; Mukherjee et al . , 1997 ) . Through such physical separation , enrichment of the re - spective cargo would be achieved . A prediction from this model is that a fluid phase marker should be mostly en - riched in subdomains of sorting endosomes that contain proteins destined for late endosomes ( bulk fluid phase do - mains ) . Using Dex3 and BSA - gold as fluid phase markers , we actually observed that the bulk of these markers segre - gated from B - fragment , but not from EGF . In addition to the described partition mechanism , which may be especially important at the level of endosomes , it has been demonstrated that protein coats play a general role in sorting ( Rothman and Wieland , 1996 ; Schekman and Orci , 1996 ) . Different subunits of clathrin and coat - omer protein coats have been detected on endosomes by morphological and biochemical means ( Louvard et al . , 1983 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ; Whitney et al . , 1995 ; Aniento et al . , 1996 ; Stoorvogel et al . , 1996 ; Daro et al . , 1997 ; Gu et al . , 1997 ) . Here we have found that : ( a ) As shown for the TGN ( Mat - lin and Simons , 1983 ; Brown et al . , 1995 ) , the temperature block at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C also prevented exit from EE / RE ( B - frag - ment ) . ( b ) In the presence of BFA , B - fragment remained confined to TfR - containing membrane tubules . BFA is thought to affect the function of small GTP - binding pro - Mallard et al . Direct B - fragment Early Endosome to Golgi Transport 989 teins of the ADP ribosylation factor family ( Donaldson et al . , 1992 ; Helms and Rothman , 1992 ) , and a role of ADP ribosylation factors in the formation of AP - 1 vesicles has been suggested ( Robinson and Kreis , 1992 ; Stamnes and Rothman , 1993 ; Traub et al . , 1993 ; Le Borgne et al . , 1996 ; Salamero et al . , 1996 ; Le Borgne and Hoflack , 1997 ) . In addition , AP - 1 has been shown to bind to a Tyr - containing signal in the cytoplasmic tail of TGN38 ( Reaves and Banting , 1994 b ; Ohno et al . , 1995 ) . ( c ) During low temper - ature incubations ( 19 . 5 (cid:56) C ) , the (cid:103) - adaptin subunit of AP - 1 was relocalized from the TGN to EE / RE where it colocal - ized at the light microscopical level with the B - fragment . ( d ) Our electron microscopical data show that (cid:103) - adaptin colocalized with the B - fragment in clathrin - coated mem - brane profiles on EE / RE . 47 % of all (cid:103) - adaptin—positive structures were also labeled with B - fragment , and 9 . 7 % of all internalized B - fragment was found in (cid:103) - adaptin—posi - tive coated membrane profiles . This figure compares well with data on receptor concentration in coated pits at the plasma membrane , e . g . , the Fc - receptor was found to localize at 8 % in coated pits ( Miettinen et al . , 1992 ) , and the TfR at (cid:122) 10 % ( Hansen et al . , 1992 , and refer - ences therein ) . Importantly , B - fragment accumulation in (cid:103) - adaptin—positive coated pits was much more pro - nounced than that of BSA - gold ( 33 - fold ) , further suggest - ing that (cid:103) - adaptin—positive structures play a role in B - frag - ment sorting . Tf was also found to colocalize with (cid:103) - adaptin in coated membrane profiles on endosomes . This observation is con - sistent with a recent study by Hopkins and colleagues who described the presence of the TfR in (cid:103) - adaptin—coated pu - tative basolateral recycling intermediates in polarized cells ( Futter et al . , 1998 ) . Since recycling continues at a reduced rate during low temperature incubations ( Iacopetta and Morgan , 1983 ; van der Ende et al . , 1989 ) , B - fragment— and Tf - HRP—containing , (cid:103) - adaptin—positive membrane pro - files observed at 19 . 5 (cid:56) C could correspond to recycling intermediates . However , our triple - labeling experiments further show that aside from (cid:103) - adaptin—positive structures that contain both , B - fragment and Tf - HRP , (cid:103) - adaptin— positive structures labeled for only B - fragment are signifi - cantly more abundant than (cid:103) - adaptin—positive structures labeled for Tf - HRP only . Altogether , these data directly implicate (cid:103) - adaptin in B - fragment sorting at the level of EE , and they suggest that in addition to a putative role in recycling , (cid:103) - adaptin may also participate in transport steps in which B - fragment rather than Tf is the predominant cargo molecule , i . e . , transport from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus . It may finally be noted that the B - fragment— and (cid:103) - adaptin—positive , but Tf - HRP—negative structures detected in this study by electron microscopy could corre - spond to the peripheral , (cid:103) - adaptin—positive , but TfR - nega - tive membranes described by Futter et al . ( 1998 ) in immu - nofluorescence experiments . Recently , Sandvig and colleagues ( Llorente et al . , 1998 ) demonstrated a role for dynamins in ricin transport from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus . Dynamins have been directly implicated through genetic , morphological , and biochemical evidence in the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( for review see De Camilli et al . , 1995 ; Warnock and Schmid , 1996 ) , and a function for dynamins in trans - port of toxins from EE / RE to the Golgi apparatus would thus be consistent with the proposed role of clathrin coated vesicles in this pathway ( this study ) . The B - fragment represents an important tool to study an as yet basically unexplored transport route . Future studies will help to unravel in further detail the molecular mechanisms that underlie transport between EE / RE and the Golgi apparatus . We thank R . Golsteyn , S . Amigorena , and P .
