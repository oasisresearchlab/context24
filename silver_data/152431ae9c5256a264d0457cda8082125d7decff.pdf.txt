All household members received 26 consecutively intensive RT - PCR testing for SARS - CoV - 2 and routine symptom monitoring 27 within 14 days after exposure to a confirmed case . We described the characteristics of study 28 participants and estimated the transmission parameters . Both secondary infection attack rates 29 ( SAR I ) and secondary clinical attack rates ( SAR C ) among adult household contacts were 30 computed , through which the transmission heterogeneities in infectivity and susceptibility 31 were characterized and the vaccine effectiveness were estimated . 32 Results : We estimated the mean incubation period of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant to be 4 . 6 33 ( median : 4 . 4 , IQR : 3 . 1 - 6 . 0 ) days and the mean serial interval to be 3 . 9 ( median : 4 . 0 , IQR : 34 1 . 4 - 6 . 5 ) days . The overall SAR I and SAR C among adult household contacts were 77 . 11 % ( 95 % 35 confidence interval [ CI ] : 73 . 58 % - 80 . 63 % ) and 67 . 03 % ( 63 . 09 % - 70 . 98 % ) . We found higher 36 household susceptibility in females , while infectivity was not significantly different in 37 primary cases by age , sex , vaccination status and clinical severity . The estimated VEs of full 38 vaccination was 14 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 5 . 8 % - 22 . 9 % ) against Omicron infection and 21 . 5 % ( 95 % 39 CI : 10 . 4 % - 31 . 2 % ) against symptomatic disease . The booster vaccination was 18 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 40 9 . 0 % - 27 . 7 % ) and 24 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 12 . 3 % - 34 . 7 % ) effective against infection and 41 symptomatic disease , respectively . 42 Conclusions : We found high household transmission during the Omicron wave in Shanghai 43 due to asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic transmission in the context of city - wide lockdown , 44 indicating the importance of early detection and timely isolation of SARS - CoV - 2 infections 45 .

Marginal effectiveness of inactivated vaccines against 46 Omicron infection poses great challenge for prevention and control of the SARS - CoV - 2 47 Omicron variant . 48 Keywords : SARS - CoV - 2 , Omicron variant , household transmission , vaccine effectiveness . 49 50 Background 51 The COVID - 19 pandemic caused by SARS - CoV - 2 has resulted in unprecedented global 52 health crisis and more than six million deaths worldwide since December 2019 [ 1 ] . Despite 53 the increasing natural immunity and vaccine - induced immunity are common in population , 54 the newly emerged Omicron variant , with increased transmissibility and immune escape 55 properties , has rapidly replaced previous strains and driven a new surge of SARS - CoV - 2 56 infections across the world [ 2 , 3 ] . China maintained local containment through effective 57 border controls and non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) since 2020 and has successfully 58 coped with several importation - linked local outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 variants [ 4 ] . In the 59 meantime , Chinese government spared no efforts to promote countrywide mass COVID - 19 60 vaccination roll - out among adults since April 2021 and among children aged 3 - 17 years since 61 July 2021 [ 5 , 6 ] . Nevertheless , following the first cluster of Omicron infections detected in 62 late February , 2022 , a local epidemic wave caused by Omicron BA . 2 sub - lineage hit 63 Shanghai , one of the largest metropolitans with a population of nearly 25 million in China , 64 with widespread community transmission occurred in late March and peaked in April , despite 65 the implementation of mass vaccination and city - wide lockdown [ 7 ] .

Households are important transmission venues for 70 SARS - CoV - 2 [ 9 - 11 ] . A full understanding of the household transmission patterns of 71 SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant is crucial to plan and adjust the public health responses and 72 target intervention in face of the current challenge of Omicron epidemics . Recently , a few 73 studies from Danish , Norway and the US have reported higher household secondary attack 74 rates ( 25 . 1 % ~ 52 . 7 % ) for Omicron variant than for Delta variant [ 12 - 16 ] . However , accurately 75 determining the household transmission dynamics regardless of symptoms remains 76 challenging , as most studies were based on the analysis of symptom - based screening data , 77 with asymptomatic infections and mild non - medically consulted infections underreported . 78 This challenge can be addressed by studies of close contacts with routine SARS - CoV - 2 79 testing regardless of symptoms to detect asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases . As 80 household contacts of SARS - CoV - 2 - positive cases are likely to be highly exposed to the case 81 and are known to be at high - risk of infection , they are an ideal group shedding lights on 82 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics [ 17 ] . 83 Here , we conducted a case - ascertained study to determine the features of household 84 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant in Shanghai , China . In particular , we 85 estimated the distribution of key time - to - event intervals , quantified the household 86 transmission risk and explored the transmission heterogeneities in infectivity and 87 .

In the meantime , we also assessed the vaccine effectiveness of inactivated 88 COVID - 19 vaccines against Omicron infection and symptomatic disease . 89 Methods 90 Cases and household contacts 91 A confirmed case is defined as a person with PCR - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection , 92 irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms , and further classified as asymptomatic , mild , 93 moderate ( non - severe pneumonia ) , severe and critical case based on both national and World 94 Health Organization ( WHO ) guidance [ 18 , 19 ] . Pneumonia was diagnosed based on either 95 radiological evidence or typical clinical signs ( fever and or cough accompanying with one of 96 the following signs : moist rales , difficulty in breathing , fast breathing , chest indrawing ) . 97 A household is defined as two or more people living in the same residence . A household 98 contact is defined as any person who has resided in the same household with a confirmed 99 case for the period from 2 days before to 14 days after the date of symptom onset or 100 laboratory confirmation . As a part of public health monitoring , consecutively intensive 101 RT - PCR testing and routine symptom monitoring within 14 days after exposure to a 102 confirmed case are required for all household contacts every day or every other day [ 20 ] . 103 The primary case ( s ) of a household was defined as confirmed case ( s ) with a history of 104 community exposure ( i . e . , exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 contaminated environment or contact 105 with a confirmed case in the community ) . For a household without determined source of 106 infection , we defined the primary case ( s ) as the first individual ( s ) who was tested positive 107 .

Other household members with positive RT - PCR 108 results were defined as secondary cases . 109 Study design and participants 110 This case - ascertained study was conducted in April 2022 at the Children’s Hospital of Fudan 111 University , a designated hospital for management of pediatric COVID - 19 cases in Shanghai . 112 During the study period when a large number of pediatric cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection 113 were detected through mass screening , the majority of pediatric cases younger than 5 years 114 old with febrile symptom and all pediatric cases with suspected pneumonia or comorbidities 115 requiring special medical attention were referred to the designated children’s hospitals , while 116 most asymptomatic and milder pediatric cases were transferred to designated isolation 117 facilities for medical observation . We enrolled a total of 335 pediatric cases infected with 118 SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant who were referred to the Children’s Hospital of Fudan 119 University during April 4 to April 27 ( Fig . 1 ) . All cases were PCR - confirmed before 120 hospitalization . The confirmed cases are discharged from isolation if the cycle threshold ( Ct ) 121 value ≥ 35 for the viral nucleic acid on RT - PCR test [ 18 ] . 122 We further enrolled all household members of the hospitalized children and followed up 123 household cases until one week after discharge . The households were excluded from the 124 study if any of the household members were reluctant to provide the complete information or 125 refused to telephone follow - up . ( Fig . 1 ) . 126 .

The household 128 information of each hospitalized case was collected according to case management 129 requirement , including demographics , exposures , vaccination status and symptoms . Clinical 130 data of hospitalized children was extracted from the electronic medical records . Other 131 detailed data on hospitalized children and their household contacts were obtained through 132 face - to - face interview to the accompanying parents using a standard questionnaire ( Table S1 ) 133 during the hospital stay and through the routine telephone follow - up one week after 134 discharge . 135 Statistical analysis 136 We estimated the incubation period ( i . e . , the period of time from an exposure resulting in 137 SARS - CoV - 2 infection to symptom onset ) by analyzing cases with clear exposure history . 138 When multiple or sustained exposure was reported , the time interval between the first and last 139 recorded dates of exposure was considered to account for the uncertainty of infection time . 140 We also estimated the serial interval ( i . e . , the time interval between the onset of symptoms in 141 a primary case and his / her secondary cases ) . For a secondary case contacts with multiple 142 infections , we randomly selected one as his / her primary case and simulated 100 times to 143 account for potential uncertainties . We fitted three parametric distributions ( Weibull , gamma 144 and lognormal ) to time - to - event data and selected the best fit based on the minimum Akaike 145 information criterion . The distributions of serial interval were fitted with a shift parameter 146 allowing negative values . 147 .

The secondary infection attack rate ( SAR I ) was defined as the number of 151 PCR - confirmed cases detected regardless of symptom among all household contacts of the 152 primary case [ 17 ] . The secondary clinical attack rate ( SAR C ) was defined as the number of 153 symptomatic cases detected among all household contacts of the primary case [ 17 ] . In this 154 study , there was a potential bias in the estimates of SAR I and SAR C among children 155 household contacts due to the study design that the enrolled households were selected from 156 the families of the confirmed hospitalized pediatric cases . Therefore , we estimated the SAR I 157 and SAR C among adult household contacts to assess the heterogeneities in infectivity and 158 susceptibility . Specifically , the heterogeneities in susceptibility were estimated by the 159 characteristics ( e . g . , sex and vaccination status ) of adult household contacts . The 160 heterogeneities in infectivity were measured by the characteristics ( e . g . , age , sex , symptom 161 profile and vaccination status ) of primary cases ( including children and adults ) . 162 Comparison between groups was performed using chi - square test . A difference with P < 0 . 05 163 at two - side was considered to be statistically significant . We estimated the vaccine 164 effectiveness against Omicron infection ( VE I ) and against clinical symptoms ( VE C ) based on 165 the estimates of SAR I and SAR C among adult household contacts with different vaccination 166 status . Specifically , the estimates of VE I were obtained from (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0) , (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:0) , (cid:3) / 167 (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:0) , (cid:4) (cid:11) , where (cid:12) (cid:3) 1 , 2 , 3 , donates the partially , fully and booster vaccinated groups among 168 the adult household contacts , respectively . (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:0) , (cid:3) donates the secondary infection rate of 169 .

Similarly , the 170 estimates of VE C were obtained from (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:5) , (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:5) , (cid:3) / (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:5) , (cid:4) (cid:11) , where (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:5) , (cid:3) 171 donates the secondary clinical attack rate of each vaccinated group and (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:5) , (cid:4) denotes that 172 of the unvaccinated group . Statistical analysis was preformed using the R software , version 173 4 . 0 . 2 ; the data were stored and maintained using Microsoft Office Excel 2019 . 174 Results 175 A total of 1274 participants from 297 households , including 323 hospitalized children and 176 951 household contacts , were finally recruited to the study ( Fig . 1 ) . Their epidemiological 177 and clinical characteristics were described in Table S2 and Fig . S1 . All household cases in 178 this study were non - severe or asymptomatic , except a 7 - year - old child , who was critically ill . 179 We analyzed the period of time from exposure resulting in SARS - CoV - 2 infection to disease 180 onset for the 52 symptomatic cases with clear exposure history . We estimated a mean 181 incubation period of 4 . 6 ( median : 4 . 4 , IQR : 3 . 1 - 6 . 0 ) days , with a standard deviation ( sd ) of 182 2 . 1 days and the 95th percentile of the distribution at 8 . 3 days ( Fig . 2A ) . The incubation 183 period was well approximated by a Weibull distribution ( Table S3 ) . We estimated the time of 184 symptom onset between the 234 transmission pairs . The serial interval followed a best fitted 185 Weibull distribution with an estimated mean of 3 . 9 ( median : 4 . 0 , IQR 1 . 4 - 6 . 5 ) days and a 186 standard deviation of 3 . 7 days ( Fig . 2B , Table S4 ) . 187 For household transmission study , we excluded 43 households with two or more primary 188 cases , 15 households without primary cases determined and 3 households without adult 189 .

We finally included 236 primary cases 190 and their 546 adult household contacts for analysis ( Fig . 1 ) . The characteristics of the 236 191 primary cases and their 546 adult household contacts were described in Table 1 . Among the 192 236 household primary cases , 169 ( 71 . 61 % ) were adults and 134 ( 56 . 78 % ) were females . 193 Only 89 ( 37 . 71 % ) of the primary cases reported a clear history of community SARS - CoV - 2 194 exposure , indicating most of the households without a determined source of infection . We 195 found 37 . 71 % of the primary cases were unvaccinated , 2 . 97 % , 35 . 59 % and 23 . 73 % of the 196 primary cases received partial , full and booster vaccination , respectively . Most primary cases 197 ( 89 . 83 % ) were symptomatic . Among the 546 adult household contacts , 421 secondary cases 198 were identified and 366 ( 86 . 94 % ) developed symptoms . The overall SAR I and SAR C among 199 adult household contacts were 77 . 11 % ( 95 % CI : 73 . 58 % - 80 . 63 % ) and 67 . 03 % ( 95 % CI : 200 63 . 09 % - 70 . 98 % ) , respectively . We found the infectivity was not significantly different in 201 primary cases with different age , sex , vaccination status and symptom profile ( P > 0 . 05 , Table 202 2 ) . For the transmission heterogeneities in susceptibility , we found a higher proportion of 203 females ( 59 . 86 % vs 38 . 4 % ) and a lower proportion of vaccinated individuals ( 76 . 72 % vs 204 89 . 9 % ) in secondary cases than in uninfected household contacts ( Table 1 ) . Accordingly , we 205 found higher susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron infection in females ( SAR I = 84 % ) 206 within household than in males ( SAR I = 68 . 7 % , p < 0 . 001 ) . Similar conclusion was reached 207 when the susceptibility was measured by SAR C ( 74 % for females and 58 . 54 % for males , 208 p < 0 . 001 ) . Unvaccinated adults were associated with the highest risk of household infection 209 ( SAR I = 88 . 29 % ) and symptomatic infection ( SAR c = 81 . 08 % ) , while SAR I could be reduced to 210 84 % , 75 . 21 % and 71 . 59 % ( P = 0 . 007 ) , and SAR C could be reduced to 76 % , 63 . 68 % and 61 . 36 % 211 .

The estimated VE of booster 214 vaccination was 18 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 9 . 0 % - 27 . 7 % ) against Omicron infection and 24 . 3 % ( 95 % 215 CI : 12 . 3 % - 34 . 7 % ) against symptomatic disease . By contrast , partial vaccination has no 216 significant effect on preventing Omicron infection ( 4 . 9 % , 95 % CI : - 14 . 4 % - 20 . 8 % ) and 217 symptomatic disease ( 6 . 3 % , 95 % CI : - 18 . 9 % - 26 . 1 % ) ( Table 4 ) . 218 Discussion 219 This study of household transmission patterns is based on a well - designed case - ascertained 220 study during the Omicron wave in Shanghai , China , with detailed household investigations 221 and consecutively intensive RT - PCR testing . Our results showed high risk of household 222 transmission due to the transmission from pre - symptomatic and asymptomatic infections , 223 despite the implementation of city - wide lockdown and centralized isolation / quarantine of 224 cases and close contacts in hospitals or designated facilities . We observed no significant 225 difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and 226 between age , sex and vaccination groups , while susceptibility to Omicron infection among 227 female household contacts was higher than males . Our findings also implied marginal 228 effectiveness of inactivated vaccines against Omicron infection and symptomatic diseases , 229 although inactivated vaccines may show high effectiveness against severe outcomes [ 18 - 20 ] . 230 In this study , detailed information on exposures and symptoms of the study participants was 231 .

We observed a mean incubation period of 4 . 6±2 . 1 233 days for Omicron variant , slightly longer than prior estimates for Omicron ( 3 . 0 - 3 . 6 days ) 234 [ 21 - 25 ] while shorter than that of the ancestral strain ( 6 . 3 days ) [ 26 ] . The 95th percentile of 235 the incubation period distribution was at 8 . 3 days , suggesting the feasibility of a shorter 236 quarantine period for close contacts or population at risk . Additionally , studies from Spanish , 237 Netherlands , South Korea , Belgium and the US showed shorter serial intervals for Omicron , 238 with the mean estimates ranging from 2 . 75 - 4 . 8 days [ 12 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ] . In agreement 239 with prior findings , we observed a mean serial interval of 3 . 9±3 . 7 days , falling within this 240 interval . Shortened serial interval suggested increased transmissibility and growth advantage 241 of Omicron variant , making timely contact tracing more challenging [ 32 ] . 242 Omicron infection resulted in high attack rates among household contacts in this investigation . 243 We estimated the overall SAR I among adult household contacts to be 77 . 11 % , around 2 . 5 - 6 244 times higher than previous estimates ( 13 . 2 % ~ 31 . 6 % ) in Wuhan , Zhejiang , Shenzhen , 245 Guangzhou and Beijing during the first COVID - 19 wave in China when the national 246 lockdown was implemented [ 10 , 33 - 36 ] , consistent with prior studies indicating increased 247 transmissibility of Omicron to preexisting variants [ 13 , 15 , 37 ] . The overall estimates of 248 SAR C among adult household contacts in our study were 67 . 03 % , higher than that reported in 249 the US ( 52 . 7 % ) , Danish ( 31 % ) and Norway ( 25 . 1 % ) [ 15 - 17 ] . This may be partially explained 250 by the longer duration and higher frequency of contacts between household members during 251 the lockdown period , as well as the circulation of more transmissible Omicron BA . 2 252 .

More particularly , our investigation captured all potential 253 household secondary infections as centralized isolation was required for all household 254 contacts for medical observation and intensive RT - PCR testing regardless of symptom . 255 Besides , despite strict NPIs were implemented in Shanghai ( e . g . , city - wide lockdown , 256 stay - at - home order , mass testing and isolation / quarantine of all SARS - CoV - 2 infections and 257 close contacts ) , our study showed that silent transmission from pre - symptomatic and 258 asymptomatic infections largely reduced the impact of interventions on stopping the 259 household transmission , stressing the importance of early detection and timely isolation of 260 the confirmed cases and quarantine of their contacts . 261 During the Omicron wave , substantial increase in pediatric cases of COVID - 19 was reported 262 in the US [ 38 ] . However , the role of children in Omicron transmission has yet to be fully 263 understood . We observed similar high infectivity in pediatric cases ( aged 0 - 17 years ) and in 264 adults ( aged 18 + years ) , indicating that children played an equal role in Omicron 265 transmission in household as adults . We found females were more susceptible to Omicron 266 infection in household than males , in line with the finding reported in an early study from 267 Wuhan [ 10 ] . Part explanation was that females are more likely to be the caregivers for the 268 sick cases in households . Our finding also demonstrated the similar high - level transmission 269 rate from symptomatic and asymptomatic primary cases , which implies that symptom - based 270 surveillance is insufficient to prevent and control of COVID - 19 epidemic , posing great 271 challenge for prevention and control of Omicron transmission . Of particular note , we 272 observed significantly higher susceptibility to Omicron infection for unvaccinated household 273 .

The estimated VEs against Omicron infection and symptomatic disease 275 was 14 . 8 % and 21 . 5 % for fully vaccination , and 18 . 9 % and 24 . 3 % for booster vaccination . 276 An update meta - analysis based on 4 household transmission studies from Danish , Norway 277 and the US reported that the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines for fully vaccinated contacts 278 was 18 . 1 % [ 37 ] , which is similar to our findings . The marginal VEs against Omicron 279 infection and mild disease suggest significant immune escape of Omicron variant to 280 vaccine - induced antibody protection and waning vaccine immunity over time [ 39 , 40 ] . 281 However , the role of the current COVID - 19 vaccines remains valuable in minimizing the 282 direct disease burden of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant because VE estimates against the 283 Omicron variant remain higher for severe disease in the majority of studies [ 40 ] . For severe 284 disease caused by Omicron variant , VE of the primary series showed little decline over six 285 months and the first booster dose vaccination improved VE ( ≥ 70 % ) following three to six 286 months from a booster dose [ 40 ] . 287 Household transmission patterns are somewhat heterogeneous across studies . The accuracy of 288 the results may be affected by a high degree of methodologic heterogeneity with respect to 289 method and frequency of testing for diagnosis of contacts , isolation of cases and duration of 290 follow - up . A major strength of this study is that we captured all secondary symptomatic and 291 asymptomatic infections of the recruited households as all household members received 292 consecutive RT - PCR testing for SARS - CoV - 2 after a primary household case was identified . 293 The estimation of VE is more objective because exposure risk and contact pattern of 294 .

However , our study is not without limitations . First , despite in - depth 296 household investigation and follow - up of each case , we could not always reconstruct the 297 entire transmission chain and fully avoid recall bias in individual records . We tried to collect 298 information on source of exposures for each household to avoid potential bias , but there are 299 still some households without determined source of infection . The primary cases of these 300 households were defined as the first household members with positive RT - PCR testing results 301 or the sign of COVID - 19 symptoms , which may misclassify the primary and secondary cases 302 of a households . Second , due to the study design ( i . e . , the study households were selected 303 from those of the confirmed pediatric cases ) , we can only estimate the transmission risk 304 among adult household contacts , the susceptibility of household children cannot be assessed . 305 Third , we did not collect specific age of household contacts , only classified them as children 306 ( i . e . , 0 - 17 years ) and adults ( i . e . , 18 + years ) . Further investigations with detailed age 307 information could help provide age - specific infectivity and susceptibility of Omicron variant . 308 Multivariate analysis adjusted for age , sex and other related factor should be conducted to 309 estimate the vaccine effectiveness . 310 Conclusions 311 In conclusion , high household transmission during the Omicron wave in Shanghai indicates 312 the importance of early detection and timely isolation of SARS - CoV - 2 infections . Marginal 313 effectiveness of inactivated vaccines against Omicron infection poses great challenge for 314 prevention and control of the SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant , implying the necessity of 315 .
