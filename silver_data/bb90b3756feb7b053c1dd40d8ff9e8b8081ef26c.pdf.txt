The aim of this study was to determine the extent of SARS - CoV - 2 infection among household contacts of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases living in Hot spot areas of Great Tunis , Tunisia by estimating the seroprevalence of antibodies anti SARS - CoV - 2 and to identify factors associated to seroprevalence at the ﬁrst stage of the pandemic in order to guide decision making and to constitute a baseline for further longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 . The National Observatory of New and Emerging Diseases ( ONMNE ) , Ministry of Health Tunisia ( MoH ) , with the support of the Ofﬁce of the World Health Organization Representative in Tunisia and the WHO Regional Ofﬁce for the Eastern Mediterranean ( EMRO ) ) , conducted a household cross - sectional survey on April 2020 in Great Tunis ( Tunis , Ariana , Manouba and Ben Arous ) . The study was based on the WHO seroepidemiological investigation protocol for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . SARS - CoV - 2 speciﬁc antibodies ( IgG and IgM ) were qualitatively detected using a lateral immunoassay that detect SARS - CoV - 2 nucleocapsid protein and administered by the interviewers . The included subjects were conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases and their households contacts resided in hot spot areas ( cumulative incidence rate ≥ 10 cases / 100 , 000 inhabitants ) of Great Tunis . Results : In total , 1165 subjects were enrolled : 116 conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases ( 43 active cases and 73 convalescents cases ) and 1049 household contacts resided in 291 households . The median age of participants was 39 . 0 with 31 years’ interquartile range ( Min = 8 months ; Max = 96 years ) . The sex ratio ( M / F ) was 0 . 98 . Twenty - nine per cent of participants resided in Tunis . The global crude seroprevalence among household contacts was 2 . 5 % ( 26 / 1049 ) ; 95 % CI 1 . 6 – 3 . 6 % , 4 . 8 % ; 95 % CI 2 . 3 – 8 . 7 % in Ariana governorate and 0 . 3 % ; 95 % CI 0 . 01 % – 1 . 8 % in Manouba governorate . In multivariate analysis , the associated factors independently related to seroprevalence were age ≥ 25 years ( aOR = 5 . 1 ; 95 % CI 1 . 2 – 22 . 0 ) , history of travel outside Tunisia since January 2020 ( aOR = 4 . 6 ; 95 % CI 1 . 7 – 12 . 9 ) , symptomatic illness in the previous four months ( aOR = 3 . 5 ; 95 % CI 1 . 4 – 9 . 0 ) and governorate of residence ( p = 0 . 02 ) . The low seroprevalence estimated among household contacts in Great Tunis reﬂect the effect of public health measures early taken ( national lockdown , borders closed , remote work ) , the respect of non - pharmaceutical interventions and the efﬁcacy of COVID - 19 contact - tracing and case management at the ﬁrst stage of the pandemic in Tunisia .

Introduction On 11 March 2020 World Health Organization declared the COVID - 19 epidemic caused by the emergent virus : Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) as pandemic . This is the ﬁrst pandemic caused by a coronavirus and the 6th Public Health Emergency of International Concern [ 1 , 2 ] . The severity of the disease ranged from asymptomatic cases , mild symptom , severe cases ( Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome or ARDS ) , critical cases and death . However asymptomatic and mild cases can be a substantial source of transmission in the commu - nity , representing a signiﬁcant challenge to prevent human to human transmission . In addition , the substantial proportion of asymptomatic or mild cases is not known since not targeted by most testing strategies and the true burden of the virus circulation may be underestimated [ 3 ] . By the end of April 2020 , more than 2 . 8 million cases have been conﬁrmed , with around 193 , 000 deaths worldwide [ 4 ] . Despite the effectiveness of non - pharmaceutical measures in reducing the spread of infection : lockdown , physical distancing , hand hygiene , wearing face mask , school closure , and remote work , left of the measures is closely depended on the extent of infection in the population [ 5 ] . Therefore , several seroepidemiological studies have been conducted or are ongoing using different testing methods and different protocols [ 6 ] . Determining the SARS - CoV - 2 prevalence among people with asymptomatic / mild symptoms or who were never tested despite having symptoms can be a way of monitor - ing the circulation of the virus in general population , thus helping decisions makers to implement strategies to minimize the risk of transmission , especially in the absence of prophylactic or effective treatment . In Tunisia , the ﬁrst case was detected on 2 March 2020 . As of April 26 , more than 950 cases were conﬁrmed , with 40 deaths and a fatality rate around 4 % [ 7 ] . The epidemic was mainly ( epicenter of outbreak ) in the : North ( Great Tunis ) and South ( Kebili and Medenine ) of the country . The extent of the SARS - CoV - 2 circulation and the COVID - 19 epidemic in Tunisia was unknown three months after the virus circulation in Tunisia . The objective of this study was to determine the extent of SARS - CoV - 2 infection among household contacts of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases living in Hot spot areas of Great Tunis , Tunisia by estimating the seroprevalence of antibodies anti SARS - CoV - 2 ( both active and past infections exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 virus ) and to identify factors associated to seroprevalence at the ﬁrst stage of the pandemic in order to guide decision making and to constitute a baseline for further longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Study Design The National Observatory of New and Emerging Diseases ( ONMNE ) , Ministry of Health Tunisia ( MoH ) , conducted a household cross - sectional survey with the support of World Health Organization ( The Ofﬁce of the WHO Representative in Tunisia and The WHO Regional Ofﬁce for the Eastern Mediterranean ( EMRO ) ) on April 2020 . The study was based on the World health organization seroepidemiological investigation protocol for SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 8 , 9 ] . 2 . 2 . Study Setting and Population This exhaustive study was conducted among all survivors conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases ( active and convalescent cases ) recorded in our national database ( ONMNE ) and their household contacts , living in the hot spot areas in Great Tunis is located in North Est of Tunisia and is divided into four governorates : Tunis , Ariana , Manouba and Ben Arous ( Figure 1 ) . It accounts 2 , 863 , 562 inhabitants in 2020 , such 24 % of the total Tunisian population . Epidemiologia 2023 , 4 190 Epidemiologia 2023 , 2 , FOR PEER REVIEW 3 2 . 2 .

Deﬁnitions Case Deﬁnition [ 7 ] : ( According to Our National Guidelines ) - A conﬁrmed COVID - 19 case : Every person , symptomatic or not , meeting the laboratory conﬁrmation diagnostic ( Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 ribonucleic acid by RT - PCR in a respiratory specimen ) . The laboratory must be authorized by MoH . - A close contact was deﬁned as the contact that had experienced any one of the following exposures during the three days before and the 14 days after the onset of symptoms for symptomatic cases or the date on which the sample was taken which led to conﬁrmation for asymptomatic of a probable or conﬁrmed case [ 7 , 10 ] : Epidemiologia 2023 , 4 191 • Face - to - face contact with a probable or conﬁrmed case within one meter and for morethan 15 min ; • Direct physical contact with a probable or conﬁrmed case ; • Direct care for a patient with probable or conﬁrmed • COVID - 19 disease without using proper personal protective equipment - A household was deﬁned as a residential place with a unique address ( residential insti - tutions , such as boarding schools , dormitories , hostels or prisons were excluded ) [ 11 ] - Index patient is the ﬁrst conﬁrmed case in a household . - A household contact : a person ( irrespective of age and sex ) living in the same house - hold of the index patient during their illness ( infectivity period ) - A hot spot area is any area with cumulative incidence rate ≥ 10 cases / 100 , 000 inhabitants . 3 . Data Collection Tool 3 . 1 . a - Questionnaire A face - to - face interview using a numeric standardized questionnaire was conducted by trained interviewers ( health care workers ) . Five items were recorded : identity of household and participant ( age , gender , nationality , number of phone , email address , residence address and occupation ) ; SARS - CoV - 2 infection status at the time of the survey ( not infected , active or convalescent case ) , previous exposure in the last four months ( travel outside / inside Tunisia , close contact with a suspected or a conﬁrmed case in the previous four months ) , symptom illness in the previous four months , and Rapid Antibody Test ‘s ( RAT ) result . 3 . 2 . b - Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 IgM and IgG Antibodies SARS - CoV - 2 speciﬁc antibodies were detected by a SARS - CoV - 2 antibody RAT col - loidal gold immunochromatography , ( Lepu Medical Technology Co . , Ltd , Beijing , P . R . China ) , a Lateral Flow Immunoassays qualitative IgG / IgM detection system by SARS - CoV - 2 nucle - ocapsid protein ( N protein ) detection . The test Kit’s performance was internally assessed prior to this survey by a national survey and the sensitivity and speciﬁcity were respec - tively 65 . 7 % ; 95 % CI 59 . 7 – 71 . 3 % and 96 . 3 % ; 95 % CI 93 . 0 – 98 . 3 % . For IgM , sensitivity and speciﬁcity were respectively 36 . 5 % ; 95 % CI 30 . 8 – 42 . 6 % and 97 . 9 % ; 95 % CI 95 . 2 – 99 . 3 % . For IgG , sensitivity and speciﬁcity were respectively 61 . 2 % ; 95 % CI 55 . 2 % – 67 . 1 % and 97 . 5 % ; 95 % CI 94 . 7 – 99 . 1 % [ 12 ] . According to manufacturer’s instruction , 20 µ L of whole blood sample was added into the sample port followed by adding 2 to 3 drops ( 80 µ L ) of dilution buffer . Test kits was visually read after about 15 min ; 10 – 20 min ) . We consider a RAT as positive if any band on the test kit indicating the presence of IgM and / or IgG antibodies . We consider a RAT as negative if none of the IgM and IgG antibodies were detected . 4 . Data Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Epi info software ( version 7 . 2 . 4 available at https : / / www . cdc . gov / epiinfo / , accessed on 29 May 2022 ) . The dependent variable ( outcome ) was seroprevalence ( Yes / No ) deﬁned as : - Crude ( Apparent ) seroprevalence among household contacts ( % ) : ( number of persons tested positive by RAT / total tested household contacts ) × 100 - Adjusted ( True ) seroprevalence for performances of test used ( RAT sensitivity and speciﬁcity ) ( % ) following this formula [ 13 – 15 ] ; Crude prevalence + Speci f icity − 1 Sensitivity + Speci f icity − 1 ( 1 ) The True prevalence was estimated from apparent prevalence using Bayesian Methods . Epidemiologia 2023 , 4 192 - Seropositivity rate among conﬁrmed cases ( % ) : ( number of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases tested positive by RAT / total tested COVID - 19 cases ) × 100 The independent variables included demographic variables ( age , gender , governorate of residence ) , History of travel outside Tunisia since January 2020 , Having symptomatic illness in the previous 4 months , Having close contact with a suspected or a conﬁrmed case . Quantitative variables were expressed by median , interquartile range , minimum and maximum . Qualitative variables were described by number and percentage . 95 % Conﬁdence interval ( 95 % CI ) of percentage was calculated using exact binomial distribution . We used ROC ( receiver operating characteristic ) curve to determine the level of quan - titative variable ( age ) from which the association with seroprevalence was signiﬁcant . To establish associated factors to SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies seroprevalence we used univariate analysis to establish association between percentages ( Chi - square test or Fisher’s exact test when an expected value was less than 5 ) . A p - value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . Interaction ( bivariate analysis ) using Woolf Test of Homogeneity . A p - value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . Independent factors associated to seroprevalence were identiﬁed through a multivari - ate analysis ( stepwise : backward logistic regression ) using variables signiﬁcantly associated to seroprevalence in univariate analysis ( p ≤ 0 . 2 ) , confounders factors and effect modiﬁer ( interaction ) were tested . The variables selected in the ﬁnal model had a p < 0 . 05 . Model ﬁtting was tested by Hosmer - Lemeshow test . 5 . Ethical Considerations A written informed consent was provided by all participants before participating in this survey . Consent for children under the legal age ( < 18 years ) were obtained from a par - ent or legal guardian . Each participant was informed that participation in the investigation is voluntary and that s / he is free to withdraw . Conﬁdentiality of participant was respected : a study identiﬁcation number by the investigation team for the labelling of questionnaires and specimens was allowed to each participant . All data were analyzed anonymously . The National Observatory get an ofﬁcial authorization from the national instance of protection of personal data ( INPDP ) according to any activity related to COVID - 19 . A pilot study was conducted in order to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the questionnaire’s items ( by interviewers and participants ) , to identify ambiguous questions , to test the technical problems , to inform about feasibility and acceptability . Relevant modiﬁcations were done and the design and the questionnaire were revised and validated for this study . 6 . Results In total , 1049 Household contacts of 116 conﬁrmed COVID - 19 index cases ( 73 conva - lescents and 43 active cases ) were enrolled , thus , 1165 subjects , resided in 291 households , were enrolled in the study . The response rate was 88 % . 6 . 1 .

Discussion At the time of this study , 3 months after registered the ﬁrst case , the Great Tunis , a major administrative and socioeconomic center , and the main source of transmission in the country ( half of the cases and half of the deaths at the time of survey ) , would beneﬁt from being well explored to get an idea of the SARS - CoV - 2 circulation . Our results showed a relatively low seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in this region ( 2 . 5 % ) . There was substantial geographical variability , with higher prevalence at Ariana ( 4 . 8 % ) and lower at Manouba governorate ( 0 . 3 % ) . This is in favor of most of the population appears to have remained unexposed to SARS - CoV - 2 , even in areas with widespread virus circulation . In addition , most of participants reported compatible symptom with COVID - 19 ill - ness were seronegative . This improve the low circulation of the virus around COVID - 19 conﬁrmed cases . To achieve herd immunity , the minimum level of population immunity to ﬁght the spread of infection in the community would be 1 - ( 1 / R0 ) [ 16 ] . Having an history of travel outside the country since January 2020 was the mainly fac - tor associated to seroprevalence in univariate analysis . This is explained by the importance of imported case during the ﬁrst wave of COVID - 19 epidemic in Tunisia . Household contacts aged 25 years and above , history of travel outside Tunisia since January 2020 , symptomatic illness in the previous 4 months and governorate of residence were signiﬁcantly associated to seropositivity in multivariate analysis . In Ariana , many conﬁrmed cases were self - isolated at home and not in dedicated center that could explained in party the higher seroprevalence observed compared to other governorates . Epidemiologia 2023 , 4 198 Those differences in seroprevalence between governorates were also reﬂected in cu - mulative incidence rate , which were much higher in Tunis ( 18 . 7 / 100 , 000 inhabitants ) and Ariana ( 14 . 4 / 100 , 000 habitants ) and the lowest in Manouba governorate ( 9 . 3 / 100 , 000 in - habitants ) [ 7 ] . In our study , seroprevalence was not signiﬁcantly varied by gender , children and adolescents were less affected than others . Those facts were also reported by others studies [ 6 , 17 , 18 ] . RAT for antibodies detection was used for seroprevalence measure : during the study period , ELISA ( chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay ) was not yet available . Fur - thermore , WHO was authorized RAT using for seroprevalence [ 8 ] . Comparison between seroprevalence should be done with precautions regarding to the difference in methodologies : study population , study design , study period , type of test used and adjusted for performance’s test . In the European countries and United Kingdom , seroprevalence ranged between 1 . 0 % in UK ( Scotland ) to 42 . 4 % in Austria [ 19 ] . In addition , different prevalence of antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 were reported by several countries : Spain 5 . 0 % ; 95 % CI 4 . 7 % – 5 . 4 % ; Geneva , Switzerland 4 · 8 % ; 95 % CI 2 . 4 % – 8 . 0 % the ﬁrst week and 10 . 8 % ; 95 % CI 8 . 2 % – 13 . 9 % the ﬁfth week ; Wuhan , China 3 . 8 % ; Stockholm , Sweden ( 7 . 3 % ) , Guilan , Iran 22 . 0 % ; 95 % CI 19 . 0 % – 26 . 0 % ; California , USA 4 . 1 % ; 95 % CI 2 . 8 % – 5 . 6 % ; Rio de Janeiro , Brazil 4 . 0 % ; 95 % CI 3 . 3 % – 4 . 7 % [ 6 , 17 , 18 , 20 – 23 ] . 7 . 1 . Strengths of Study At the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Tunisia and among the fewer in the WHO’s EMRO . Before conducting this study , we internally validated our RDT serological assay through a national survey ( sensitivity of 65 . 7 % ; 95 % CI ( 59 . 7 – 71 . 3 % ) and a speciﬁcity of 96 . 3 % ; 95 % CI ( 93 . 0 – 98 . 3 % ) ) [ 12 ] . After validation of the RDT , we evaluated the sero - prevalence in Great Tunis after the ﬁrst wave of COVID - 19 outbreak . The serological test for the presence of antibodies ( IgM or IgG ) against SARS - CoV - 2 can provide a more accurate estimate of the cumulative prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in a population since the beginning of the outbreak , compared to the molecular test ( RT - PCR ) , in particular IgG resigned for past exposure , are likely to persist for a longer period of time after the viral infection is cleared . Therefore , we can estimate the extent of RT - PCR undetected SARS - CoV - 2 infection . The global cumulative incidence was around 8 cases / 100 , 000 inhabitants as of April 2020 . Regarding this low incidence in the Tunisian population , we decided to conduct the sero - epidemiological survey among household contact of conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases in hot spot areas to better estimate the maximum of the seroprevalence . The study was conducted when lockdown measures were still maintained , which help to maximize the response rate . 7 . 2 . Limits of Study Our study had several limitations . Such seroprevalence studies provide information only about exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 and do not provide titer of neutralizing antibodies that would protect recovered patients from secondary infection ( reinfection ) . Because our study population was not drawn by random sampling , the estimation of the seroprevalence was subject to potential sampling bias and we cannot extrapolate the results to general population , but the study was exhaustive and the results were strength for the study population . The estimated prevalence reported may be biased ( selection bias ) due to non - response or that symptomatic persons may have been more likely to participate . This bias is neg - ligible regarding to fewer proportion of symptomatic participants ( only 7 . 1 % reported symptomatic illness compatible to COVID - 19 in the previous 4 months ) and the high percentage of response rate time when our study was conducted . Epidemiologia 2023 , 4 199 The sensitivity of the serological test depends on the internal kit’s performance and the test time from the onset of disease . Samples collected from infected individuals outside the time window of antibody response could produce false negatives results , and therefore the observed seroprevalence in our study could potentially underestimate the true prevalence rate of the disease . But adjusting the seroprevalence estimate for performance’s test limit this bias . Taking into account the cross - sectional design of the study , the dynamic changes of antibody titer in infected individuals over time were not evaluated , inducted a measure bias . 8 . Conclusions This study revealed that the prevalence of antibody seropositivity in a highly affected area in Great Tunis varied between 0 . 3 and 4 . 8 % and was low in global ( 2 . 5 % ) . Ariana and Manouba governorates were respectively the most and the less affected areas . Those ﬁnding reﬂect the effect of public health measures early taken : national lock - down , borders closed , remote work and the respect of non - pharmaceutical interventions and the efﬁcacy of COVID - 19 case and contacts management . These estimates have implications for future public policy guidelines ( containment lifting , borders opening ) while reinforcing barrier measures ( physical distancing , hand washing and face mask wearing ) . In light of these results , any proposed approach to achieve temporary herd immunity through natural infection is not only highly unethical , but also unachievable . Starting from the hypothesis that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity , these results highlight that the epidemic is far from over with a large majority of the population being infection naïve . SARS - CoV - 2 virus circulation can quickly and severely return to early outbreak dimensions in a second wave most dangerous than the ﬁrst once preventive measures are lifted .
