Experimentally activated immune defence in female pied (cid:143) ycatchers results in reduced breeding success Petteri Ilmonen 1 * , Terho Taarna 1 and Dennis Hasselquist 2 1 Section of Ecology , Department of Biology , University of Turku , FIN - 20014 Turku , Finland 2 Department of Animal Ecology , Ecology Building , S - 223 62 Lund , Sweden Traditional explanations for the negative ¢tness consequences of parasitism have focused on the direct pathogenic e¡ects of infectious agents . However , because of the high selection pressure by the parasites , immune defences are likely to be costly and trade o¡ with other ¢tness - related traits , such as reproductive e¡ort . In a ¢eld experiment , we immunized breeding female £ycatchers with non - pathogenic antigens ( diphtheria ^ tetanus vaccine ) , which excluded the direct negative e¡ects of parasites , in order to test the consequences of activated immune defence on hosts’ investment in reproduction and self - maintenance . Immunized females decreased their feeding e¡ort and investment in self - maintenance ( rectrix regrowth ) and had lower reproductive output ( £edgling quality and number ) than control females injected with saline . Our results reveal the phenotypic cost of immune defence by showing that an activated immune system per se can lower the host’s breeding success . This may be caused by an energetic or nutritional trade - o¡ between immune function and physical workload when feeding young or be an adaptive response to ` infection’ to avoid physiological disorders such as oxidative stress and immunopathology .

INTRODUCTION Life - history theory assumes that there is a trade - o¡ between an organism’s current reproductive e¡ort and its future survival and reproductive success ( Ro¡ 1992 ; Stearns 1992 ) . This concept of the costs of reproduction is based on physiological trade - o¡s between resource - demanding functions within an individual . Recently , the costs of immune defences , traits essential for an organism’s survival in pathogenic environments , have been emphasized ( Sheldon & Verhulst 1996 ) . Allocation decisions between reproductive e¡ort and immune defence are suggested to be targets for optimizing selection , favouring individuals which allocate their resources in a way which maximizes their lifetime repro - ductive success . Parasites are often known to reduce the reproductive success of their avian hosts ( Loye & Zuk 1991 ; MÖller 1997 ) . The decreased reproductive output of hosts can either be a direct pathogenic e¡ect of the parasite or a consequence of the adaptive adjustment of reproductive e¡ort to reduce the indirect negative impact of the para - site on the host’s physiology ( Forbes 1993 ; MÖller 1997 ) . Traditional explanations for how parasites a¡ect hosts are that parasites cause dysfunction of somatic systems and reduce metabolic e¤ciency ( e . g . Schall et al . 1982 ; Thompson 1990 ; Chapman & George 1991 ) or that para - sites deplete resources essential for host reproduction and self - maintenance ( Connors & Nickol 1991 ) . However , as parasites evidently exert high selection on hosts , it is probable that immune defences have evolved to such an extent that they become costly ( Keymer & Read 1991 ; Sheldon & Verhulst 1996 ) . However , direct evidence for costly immune defences is still lacking . In this study , we experimentally investigated the costs of mounting an immune response on the parental e¡ort and breeding success of the hosts . We challenged breeding female pied £ycatchers ( Ficedula hypoleuca ) with novel anti - gens and measured their investment in reproduction and somatic functions ( immune response and feather regrowth ) . By using killed pathogens ( human diphtheria ^ tetanus vaccine ) we excluded the direct negative e¡ects of parasites and , thus , tested only for the e¡ects of activating the host immune defence . We also wanted to study whether the costs of activating immune defence depend on environmental stress , as any trade - o¡ is more likely to be uncovered in stressful condi - tions ( Tuomi et al . 1983 ; Bell & Koufopanou 1986 ) . For this , we carried out the experiment within two subgroups of a population of £ycatchers , one breeding close to and the other breeding far from a copper smelt , i . e . in high - and low - pollution stress environments , respectively . 2 . MATERIAL AND METHODS ( a ) Study species The pied £ycatcher is a small ( ca . 12 ^ 13 g ) insectivorous passerine bird which ranges over most of northern and eastern Europe . Males arrive at our study area from wintering grounds in West Africa in May , approximately one week earlier than females . In our study population egg laying starts at the end of May and females lay a clutch of three to nine eggs ( mean of six eggs ) . The female incubates alone for approximately two weeks . Both sexes feed the young , which £edge at the age of 14 ^ 16 days . Females rear only one brood per breeding season . ( b ) Study area The study was conducted in the surroundings of the city of Harjavalta ( 61 8 20 0 N , 22 8 10 0 E ) , south - west Finland in 1998 . The study was carried out in two areas ; at six sites within 3 km of a copper smelter complex ( centre ) and at another six sites more Proc . R . Soc . Lond . B ( 2000 ) 267 , 665 ^ 670 665 © 2000 The Royal Society Received 22 October 1999 Accepted 7 January 2000 * Author for correspondence ( peilmo @ utu . ¢ ) . than 5 km away from the smelter ( background ) . Each site contained 30 ^ 50 nest - boxes , in total 490 nest - boxes . Elevated heavy metal concentrations occur at the sites in the centre area due to the current and long - term e¡ects of atmospheric deposi - tion from the copper smelter . The metal contents decrease expo - nentially with increasing distance from the factory complex and approach normal background levels at sites greater than 5 km from the centre ( e . g . Jussila & Jormalainen 1991 ; Koricheva & Haukioja 1995 ) . Pied £ycatchers breeding in the centre su¡er from low breeding success ( Eeva & Lehikoinen 1996 ; Eeva et al . 1997 ) and they have reduced survival rates ( Eeva & Lehikoinen 1998 ) compared to birds breeding in the background area . The two - area design , together with the fact that the breeding season in 1998 was exceptionally rainy , with the highest monthly rain - fall in June during the last ten years ( unpublished data from Peipohja Meteorological station ) , provided a good opportunity of investigating possible allocation trade - o¡s , because organisms are more likely to face such trade - o¡s under environmental stress ( Tuomi et al . 1983 ; Bell & Koufopanou1986 ) . ( c ) General methods Nest - boxes were visited at least once a week to determine the clutch initiation date , clutch size , hatching date and the number of hatched and £edged young . Females were captured a ¢rst time ¢ve days before their clutch hatched . To investigate the ability of the females to allocate resources for self - maintenance , we removed one of their outermost tail feathers . Females were captured a second time when their chicks were seven days old and a third time when their chicks were 13 ^ 14 days old ( close to £edging ) . Parents and 13 ^ 14 - day - old chicks were ringed , weighed to the nearest 0 . 1g with a Pesola spring balance and their tarsus length measured to the nearest 0 . 1mm with sliding callipers . As a measure of female body condition , we used the ratio of body mass on tarsus length . Female subcutaneous fat was scored into ¢ve classes ( 0 ^ 4 ) following Busse & Kania ( 1970 ) . We used the mean body mass of 13 ^ 14 - day - old chicks and £edging success ( the number of £edglings per hatched young ) as a measure of female reproductive success . ( d ) Immunization protocol Females with clutch sizes of ¢ve to seven eggs were immu - nized ¢ve days before the expected hatching day of their clutch by intramuscular injection in the pectoral muscle with 100 m l of diphtheria ^ tetanus vaccine ( Finnish National Public Health Institute ; diphtheria 38Lf ( limit of £occulation ) and tetanus 10 Lf , mixed with the adjuvant aluminium phosphate at 1 . 0 mgml 7 1 ) . Control females with similar laying dates ( mean § s . e . for females in the centre area , vaccine group 29 . 20 § 1 . 64 and control group 31 . 21 § 1 . 64 and mean § s . e . for females in the background area , vaccine group 32 . 20 § 1 . 58 and control group 31 . 64 § 1 . 64 ; 1 ˆ 1 May ) and clutch sizes ( mean § s . e . for females in the centre area , vaccine group 6 . 33 § 0 . 19 and control group 6 . 29 § 0 . 20 and mean s . e . for females in the background area , vaccine group 6 . 00 § 0 . 19 and control group 5 . 93 § 0 . 19 ; in both cases the e¡ects for the main factors and their interaction in two - way ANOVAs were non - signi¢cant ) were injected with 100 m l of saline . Females were blood sampled ( 120 ^ 150 m l in heparinized capillary tubes by brachial venipuncture ) prior to injection and 12 ^ 13 days after the injection ( when their chicks were approximately seven days old ) to measure activation of the humoral immune system . The blood was transferred into Eppendorf tubes containing 3 m l of heparin . The tubes were immediately stored in an icebox and centrifuged within 3 h at 3000rpm for 8 min . Plasma was extracted and stored at 7 20 8 C until later enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) analysis . ( e ) ELISA assay We measured humoral immune system activation as the antigen - speci¢c antibody levels in the females’ sera using an ELISA previously developed for red - winged blackbirds ( for details of the methods , see Hasselquist et al . ( 1999 ) ) , and this assay has also been proved to work with high accuracy for other passerines ( D . Hasselquist , unpublished data ) . This ELISA method provides sensitive measures of the amount of passerine antibodies which speci¢cally bind to a certain antigen ( here diphtheria or tetanus toxoid ) . Ninety - six - well ELISA plates were ¢rst coated with antigen ( diphtheria or tetanus toxoid ) . Diluted pre - and post - injection serum samples from female pied £ycatchers were added to the wells and the plates were then incubated overnight at 4 8 C . After washing the plates , a secondary rabbit anti - red - wingedblackbird immunoglobulin ( Ig ) antiserum was added . After a second incu - bation ( 1h at 37 8 C ) and wash , a commercial peroxidase - labelled goat anti - rabbit - Ig antiserum diluted 1 : 2000 ( cat . A6154 , SIGMA ; Sigma - Aldrich Sweden AB , Lund , Sweden ) was added to the plates . Following incubation ( 30min at 37 8 C ) and wash , peroxidase substrate ( 2 , 2 - azino - bis - 3 - ethylbenzthiazoline - 6 - sulfonic acid , ABTS ; cat . A1888 , SIGMA ) and peroxide were added and the plates were immediately transferred to a V max ( molecular dynamics ) kinetics ELISA reader . The plates were read at 30s intervals for 14 min using a 405nm wavelength ¢lter . All antibodyconcentrationsare given as the slope of the substrate conversion ( in 10 7 3 £ optical densities ( OD ) ; m OD ) over time ( m OD min 7 1 ) , with a higher slope indicating a higher concentra - tion of antigen - speci¢c antibodies in a sample . We used a diluent of 1 % powdered milk in 0 . 01 phosphate - bu¡ered saline ( pH 7 . 2 ) to produce 1 : 1600 dilutions of each pre - and post - injection serum sample . To avoid between - plate variation , we ran serum samples from all studied females on three 96 - well ELISA plates for each of the two antigens and analysed all plates on the same day . Pre - injection serum samples from each female were run in order to investigate each indivi - dual’s background level of antigen - speci¢c antibodies . For each individual , post - injection serum samples were added to the plate in duplicate and the average of these was our measure of anti - body titre for each dilution . We ran at least two wells with blank samples on each plate ( these wells were treated in the same way as the test sample wells except for not adding any bird serum ) . As our measure of pre - and post - injection antibody titres of indi - vidual females , we subtracted the mean value of these blanks from the measured antibody concentration . We ran three stan - dard samples covering the range of antibody titres for the injected females on each plate . We used the di¡erences between the standard curves to adjust pre - and post - injection antibody titres to control for between - plate variation . The antibody production against diphtheria and tetanus in the post - injection samples was at least two times higher than the pre - injection samples in all but one case among immunized females . By investigating the plots of substrate conversion over time , we con¢rmed that the antibody titres of all individuals were within the linear range of the ELISA reader . ( f ) Monitoring feeding rates The parental feeding rates ( feedings per hour ) were docu - mented with video cameras when the nestlings were ten days old . 666 P . Ilmonen and others Immune defence and reproductive success Proc . R . Soc . Lond . B ( 2000 ) Cameras were placed ca . 10 m from the nest - boxes between 8 . 00 and18 . 00h . Each nest was monitored for 80min . Monitoring was done only during rainless periods . The ¢rst 15 min and last 5 min of the video recordings were excluded from the analyses to prevent possible e¡ects of disturbance . ( g ) Statistical analyses To meet the requirements of parametric tests , we log 10 transformed the female and male feeding rates and the values of the antibody titres against diphtheria and tetanus toxoids . Treatment ( vaccination or saline injection ) and area ( centre or background ) and their interactions were entered into ANCOVA models . Brood size at the time of the video recordings was used as a covariate in the analyses of parental feeding rates and laying date as a covariate in the analysis of £edgling body mass . The logistic regression procedure in SPSS ( Noru µ sis 1993 ) was used to estimate the likelihood of the rectrix regrowth probabil - ities of females relative to treatment and area . In logistic regres - sions , treatment and area were treated as categorical ( dummy ) variables . The model with the best ¢t was chosen using back - ward ( stepwise ) model selection . The GENMOD procedure in SAS statistical software ( SAS Institute , Inc . 1989 ) was used to estimate the likelihood of £edging success ( number of £edged young / number of hatched chicks ) . We used a scale parameter to control for the e¡ects of over - dispersion on the binomial variance ( McCullagh & Nelder 1989 ) . Polygynous males and their nests were excluded from the analyses . All results are reported with two - tailed probability values . 3 . RESULTS Females immunized with diphtheria ^ tetanus vaccine showed a clear increase in both their diphtheria - and tetanus - speci¢c antibody titres , whereas among the saline - injected control females their antibody levels sustained at low , close to initial levels ( ANCOVA , initial level as covariate F 1 , 42 ˆ 4 . 42 and p ˆ 0 . 04 , e¡ect of treat - ment on diphtheria F 1 , 42 ˆ 44 . 1 and p 5 0 . 001 and least square mean ( § s . e . ) of log 10 - transformed antibody titres , saline group 0 . 04 § 0 . 09 and vaccine group 0 . 84 § 0 . 07 ; ANCOVA , initial level as covariate F 1 , 42 ˆ 3 . 19 and p ˆ 0 . 08 , e¡ect of treatment on tetanus F 1 , 42 ˆ 125 . 1 and p 5 0 . 001 and saline group 0 . 31 § 0 . 08 and vaccine group 1 . 40 § 0 . 06 ) . Neither the area nor the area ^ treatment interaction had a signi¢cant e¡ect on the diphtheria - or tetanus - speci¢c antibody titres ( all p - values 4 0 . 1 ) . The antibody responses for diphtheria and tetanus were highly correlated within immunized birds ( r ˆ 0 . 62 , p 5 0 . 001 and n ˆ 28 ) . ( a ) E¡ects of immunization on female body condition , fat stores and rectrix regrowth The treatment , area or their interaction did not have any signi¢cant e¡ect on female body condition at the end of the nestling period ( ANCOVA , incubation body condi - tion as covariate F 1 , 42 ˆ 5 . 13 and p ˆ 0 . 03 , treatment F 1 , 42 ˆ 0 . 18 and p ˆ 0 . 68 , area F 1 , 42 ˆ 0 . 79 and p ˆ 0 . 38 , and treatment £ area F 1 , 42 ˆ 0 . 13 and p ˆ 0 . 72 ) ( table 1 ) . The treatment , area or their interaction did not have any signi¢cant e¡ect on female subcutaneous fat at the end of the nestling period ( ANCOVA , incubation fat as covariate F 1 , 42 ˆ 13 . 76 and p ˆ 0 . 001 , treatment F 1 , 42 ˆ 2 . 16 and p ˆ 0 . 15 , area F 1 , 42 ˆ 0 . 00 and p ˆ 0 . 94 , and treatment £ area F 1 , 42 ˆ 0 . 01and p ˆ 0 . 93 ) ( table1 ) . Only 17 . 0 % of females ( n ˆ 47 ) started to regrow removed tail feathers during the nestling period ( table 1 ) . Control females near the centre had a higher rectrix regrowth probability compared to immunized females breeding in the same area ( treatment £ area w 2 ˆ 4 . 95 , d . f . ˆ 1 and p ˆ 0 . 03 ) ( table 1 ) . ( b ) E¡ects of immunization on parental e¡ort and breeding success Immunized females tended to feed their young less intensively than control females ( ANCOVA , brood size during recordings as covariate F 1 , 39 ˆ 3 . 35 and p ˆ 0 . 08 , and treatment F 1 , 39 ˆ 3 . 77 and p ˆ 0 . 06 ) ( ¢gure 1 ) , but area ( F 1 , 39 ˆ 1 . 30 and p ˆ 0 . 26 ) or treatment £ area ( F 1 , 39 ˆ 1 . 33 Immune defence and reproductive success P .

Vaccinated females produced £edglings in poor condi - tion ( body mass ) compared to control females ( ANCOVA , laying date as covariate F 1 , 45 ˆ 5 . 19 and p ˆ 0 . 03 , and treat - ment F 1 , 45 ˆ 4 . 10 and p ˆ 0 . 05 ) ( ¢gure 2 ) , whereas area ( F 1 , 45 ˆ 0 . 03 and p ˆ 0 . 86 ) or treatment £ area ( F 1 , 45 ˆ 0 . 72 and p ˆ 0 . 40 ) had no signi¢cant e¡ect on £edgling body mass . The £edgling success of females ( £edglings / hatched chicks ) was a¡ected both by treatment , area and their interaction ( GENMOD , treatment w 2 ˆ 12 . 71 , d . f . ˆ 1 and p ˆ 0 . 0004 , area w 2 ˆ 25 . 82 , d . f . ˆ 1 and p ˆ 0 . 0001 and treatment £ area w 2 ˆ 11 . 27 , d . f . ˆ 1 and p ˆ 0 . 0008 ) ( ¢gure 3 ) . Pairwise comparisons within areas revealed that , in the background area , vaccinated females produced signi¢cantly less £edglings than control females ( treatment w 2 ˆ 4 . 88 , d . f . ˆ 1 and p ˆ 0 . 0001 ) , whereas in the centre area , treatment had no e¡ect on £edgling success ( treatment w 2 ˆ 0 . 01 , d . f . ˆ 1 and p ˆ 0 . 92 ) . 4 . DISCUSSION We investigated the phenotypic costs of mounting an immune defence by examining trade - o¡s between immune system activation and reproductive e¡ort . Breeding pied £ycatcher females which were challenged with non - pathogenic diphtheria ^ tetanus vaccine showed reduced feeding rates compared to control birds injected with saline . As a result of the reduced female parental e¡ort , immunized females produced £edglings in poorer condition compared to control females , manifesting the cost . Among the birds breeding in the background area una¡ected by deposition from a copper smelter , vacci - nated females produced fewer £edglings per hatchling than control females . The lowered reproductive success of vaccinated females in the background area may also have been a¡ected by a reduction in feeding rates by the males as a response to the vaccination of their females . Among the birds breeding in the centre area close to the copper smelter , vaccinated females were less likely to regrow removed tail feathers than control ones , but there was no di¡erence in £edging success between female treatment groups . Although any trade - o¡ between immune defence and reproduction can be expected to be more pronounced under stressful rather than benign conditions ( Wiehn & KorpimÌki 1998 ; Ilmonen et al . 1999 ; Wiehn et al . 1999 ) , the exceptionally rainy breeding season in 1998 ( see ½ 2 ) may have made the conditions bad enough for birds breeding in the background area . However , near the smelter the e¡ects of our immune challenge were apparently overridden by stronger e¡ects of heavy metal pollution on nestling mortality . The most straightforward explanation for the observed reduction in parental e¡ort and rectrix regrowth of vacci - nated females is that experimental activation of the humoral immune defence decreased the females’ resources available for other functions . As we excluded the direct negative e¡ects of parasitism on host resources by using non - pathogenic antigens , our study shows that activation of the immune defence can be costly per se . This is in agreement with the general belief among evolu - tionary ecologists that immunological defences against pathogens compete for the host’s resources ( energy and nutrients ) needed for other resource - demanding processes , such as reproduction and self - maintenance ( Keymer & Read 1991 ; Sheldon & Verhulst 1996 ) . Recently , there has been some direct and indirect evidence for the physiological costs of immune function ( for a review , see Lochmiller & Deerenberg ( 2000 ) , but also see Klasing ( 1998 ) ) and it has been shown that increases in a birds’ parental e¡ort can result in immuno - suppression ( Deerenberg et al . 1997 ; Nordling et al . 1998 ; Moreno et al . 1999 ) . All this evidence supports the idea that both immune defence and reproductive e¡ort may not be maximized simultaneously within an individual . However , the strongest evidence for energetic costs of immune defence so far comes from the biomedical literature and is mainly based on studies of human or 668 P .

The ¢gures denote the sample sizes . laboratory mammal models ( see the review in Lochmiller & Deerenberg ( 2000 ) ) and , thus , may not be extended to ¢eld situations on wild birds . In the only study where energetic costs of mounting an immune response has been measured in wild birds , Svensson et al . ( 1998 ) found no increase in the basal metabolic rates ( BMR ) of blue tits ( Parus caeruleus ) immunized with diphtheria ^ tetanus vaccine as compared with saline controls . This and other results have made several authors suggest that mechan - isms other than energy limitation should be examined as possible explanations for the trade - o¡ between immune defence and reproduction e¡ort ( Klasing 1998 ; RÔberg et al . 1998 ; Svensson et al . 1998 ; Von Schantz et al . 1999 ) . Alternative or additive to the energetic cost scenario is the fact that immunized pied £ycatcher females reduced their reproductive e¡ort in order to avoid oxidative stress caused by deleterious free oxygen radicals ( see Von Schantz et al . 1999 ) or the risk of immunopathology ( RÔberg et al . 1998 ; Svensson et al . 1998 ) . Hence , by redu - cing parental workload individuals could avoid immuno - pathological e¡ects when mounting an immune response against the vaccine or during an infection they could decrease their net production of free radicals ( see Coyle & Puttfarken 1993 ; Liebler 1993 ; Packer et al . 1994 ) and , thus , keep oxidative stress within critical limits for the body to function without disorders . Whatever the physiological mechanisms for the observed reduction in parental e¡ort of immunized female pied £ycatchers , hosts are expected to alter their current reproductive e¡ort adaptively in order to mini - mize the negative e¡ects of parasitism on their lifetime reproductive success ( Forbes 1993 ) . If so , the bene¢ts in terms of lifetime reproductive success have to o¡set the short - term costs . On the one hand , immunized females paid the cost of mounting an immune response by producing fewer o¡spring of poorer quality . However , the bene¢ts of reduced parental workload may , during a real pathogen challenge , accrue if it allows an increased para - site resistance . The contracted infection will be kept under control , allowing parent birds to produce at least a few o¡spring during the current reproductive event and at the same time increase the prospects for survival and successful future reproduction . Furthermore , due to the development of long - term immunological memory after initial exposure , subsequent re - exposure to the same pathogen results in enhanced e¤ciency in defence response ( e . g . Wakelin & Apanius 1997 ) , most likely with positive e¡ects on hosts’ lifetime expectations . Our results suggest that birds , as a response to exposure to parasitism , can reduce their investment in self - maintenance and parental e¡ort , in the latter case even at the expense of current reproductive success . More speci¢cally , we were able to show that an activated immune system per se can lead to reduced investment in parental e¡ort and other somatic functions and , hence , the phenotypic costs of immune defence . No doubt , future studies will show the proximate mechanisms behind the observed trade - o¡s and the possible genotypic basis for the costs of immune defence .
