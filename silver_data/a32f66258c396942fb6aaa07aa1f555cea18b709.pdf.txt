To investigate the potential modes of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , 21 COVID - 19 patients from 12 to 47 days after symptom onset were recruited . We monitored the release of SARS - CoV - 2 from the patients’ exhaled breath and systematically investigated environmental J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 contamination of air , public surfaces , personal necessities , and the drainage system . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected in 0 of 9 exhaled breath samples , 2 of 8 exhaled breath condensate samples , 1 of 12 bedside air samples , 4 of 132 samples from private surfaces , 0 of 70 samples from frequently touched public surfaces in isolation rooms , and 7 of 23 feces - related air / surface / water samples . The maximum viral RNA concentrations were 1857 copies / m 3 in the air , 38 copies / cm 2 in sampled surfaces and 3092 copies / mL in sewage / wastewater samples . Our results suggest that nosocomial transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 can occur via multiple routes . However , the low detection frequency and limited quantity of viral RNA from the breath and environmental specimens may be related to the reduced viral load of the COVID - 19 patients on later days after symptom onset . These findings suggest that the transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 differ from those of SARS - CoV in healthcare settings . Key words COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , exhaled breath , aerosol , environmental sampling J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 1 . Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) was first identified from a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 . SARS - CoV - 2 is an enveloped , positive - sense , single - stranded RNA virus and the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans . It is distinct from both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) ( Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . Infection with SARS - CoV - 2 may result in a wide range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic infection to critical illness . As of August 11 , 2020 , COVID - 19 has caused a worldwide pandemic , with nearly 20 million confirmed cases and 0 . 74 million deaths ( World Health Organization , 2020a ) . SARS - CoV - 2 is believed to spread efficiently , but the exact transmission routes , especially the fomite , airborne ( or aerosol ) , and fecal - oral routes , remain under debate ( World Health Organization , 2020b ) . Viral RNA has been detected from various surfaces of isolation rooms and intensive care units in which COIVD - 19 patients are treated , but detection from air has been relatively difficult ( Chia et al . , 2020 ; Ong et al . , 2020 ) . The probable explanation is either that patients released limited virus during the sampling period or that patient’s exhaled breath ( EB ) is readily diluted by the room’s ventilation before it can be sampled , which is consistent with the proximity effect in the transmission of respiratory infections ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . Although SARS - CoV - 2 may be transmitted by transmission routes similar to those of other coronaviruses , such as large droplets , aerosols , or contact , the potential of transmission via each route requires systematic investigation . Nosocomial transmission of the virus has been reported in China : more than 3000 medical staff members have been infected during medical practice ( Zhang , 2020 ) . According to a single - center J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 case series involving 138 hospitalized patients in Wuhan , China , nosocomial transmission was suspected to occur via 29 % of infected medical staff and 12 . 3 % of hospitalized patients ( Wang et al . , 2020 ) . Similarly , the transmission of virus from a single health care worker to several other patients and health care workers was assumed to be responsible for the hospital outbreak of SARS - CoV - 2 in the University Hospital of Münster , German ( Schwierzeck et al . , 2020 ) . An accumulating body of evidence suggests that although COVID - 19 patients are mostly infectious during the early stage of infection , the high viral loads in their sputum and feces specimens during later stages of infection may still pose a risk to healthcare workers ( Zheng et al . , 2020 ) . This hypothesis has yet to be systematically evaluated . In this study , we aimed to investigate the EB and the hospital environmental contamination by COVID - 19 patients in the later stage of infection . To that end , we sampled the EB , exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) , surfaces of isolation wards , and personal necessities of 21 patients with laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 and hospital drainage systems from 12 to 47 days after symptom onset and subjected the samples to SARS - CoV - 2 detection by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - qPCR ) . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Patients Twenty - one patients with laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 who were hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospitals , College of Medicine , Zhejiang University , from February 13 , 2020 , to March 5 , 2020 , were enrolled in this study . We collected samples of EB , EBC , size - segregated aerosols from the air , frequently touched surfaces , and the drainage system . Patients’ sputum and feces specimens were collected daily by the hospital staff for purposes of routine diagnosis . The patients’ J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 clinical data were obtained from hospital electronic medical records . This study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital , College of Medicine , Zhejiang University . 2 . 2 . EB sampling An exhaled aerosol collection system was developed ( Figure S1 ) , and the patients were asked to breath normally through a mask for 30 min , during which they were asked to perform 10 forced coughs . The mask did not interrupt the patient’s oxygen inhalation . The exhaled air was sampled by the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler , which collected air at 3 . 5 L / min ( 105 - L air was sampled during the 30 - min sampling ) and separated virus - laden aerosols into three size fractions : < 1 µm , 1 – 4 µm , and > 4 µm ( Lindsley et al . , 2010 ) . After collection of EB samples , the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was disassembled in a biosafety cabinet , and 1 mL of viral transport medium was added to each collection tube and PTFE ﬁlter to suspend virus particles . 2 . 3 . EBC sampling The EBC samples were collected using a sterile laboratory - made EBC collection system comprising a 15 - mL centrifuge tube with the bottom cut off and a 50 - mL centrifuge tube ( Figure S2 ) . The patients were asked to blow into the 15 - mL centrifuge tube for 10 min . Approximately 200 – 500 μL of EBC was collected from each patient for further analysis . 2 . 4 . Room air and frequently touched surface sampling in isolation rooms For sampling of isolation room air , a NIOSH sampler was placed on a tripod 1 . 2 m in height and 0 . 2 m away from the bed at the side of the patient’s head ( Figure S3 ) . The sampling duration was 30 min , and a total of 105 - L room air was sampled . Frequently touched public and private surfaces in isolation rooms were sampled , as illustrated in Figure S3 and Table S1 . The standard sampling area was 10 × 10 cm 2 ( swab applied in horizontal J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 followed by vertical and diagonal sweeps ) . For surfaces smaller than 10 × 10 cm 2 , the entire touchable surface was swabbed . After sampling , the swabs were immediately placed into 1 . 5 mL of viral transport medium . 2 . 5 . Drainage - related sampling Virus - laden aerosols may be generated during flushing in the toilet and in sewage pipes , accounting for potential fecal - oral transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . For lavatory bioaerosol sampling , a NIOSH sampler was placed on a tripod 1 . 2 m in height and 0 . 5 m away from the toilet bowl in the lavatory of the isolation rooms ; the 30 - min sampling period began when the patient used the toilet for defecation . After the patient exited the toilet , the toilet bowl and floor drain were also swabbed for sampling . In addition , water samples were taken in 15 - mL centrifuge tubes from the main sewage pipe and wastewater pipe of the building in which the COVID - 19 patients were isolated ( Figure S4 ) . 2 . 6 . RT - qPCR Viral RNA was extracted from all collected clinical or environmental specimens using MagNA Pure LC 2 . 0 ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) . RT - qPCR was performed using a China Food and Drug Administration - approved commercial kit specific for SARS - CoV - 2 detection ( Da’an Gene Co . , Ltd . , Guangzhou , Guangdong , China ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Specimens with quantification cycle ( Cq ) values of 40 or lower were considered positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . Specimens with Cq values higher than 40 were tested again , and those with repeat Cq values that were higher than 40 or undetectable were considered negative for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . The standard curve was generated by 10 - fold serial dilutions of positive control and the fitted relationship between Cq value and virus concentration in the tested medium , C ( copies / mL ) , is as follows J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 Log ( C ) = ( 46 . 126 - Cq ) / 3 . 331 ( 1 ) 3 . Results and discussions 3 . 1 . Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA among various types of samples A total of 21 moderately to critically ill patients with COVID - 19 ( aged 13 – 72 years ; median , 61 years ) were recruited . Sampling was performed 12 to 47 DAO ( median , 29 days ) . The patients’ details are listed in Table 1 . All recruited patients were in the recovery period with normal body temperature and improved lung infection conditions according to computed tomography scan . Viral loads in the sputum specimens were detected varying from negative to 1 . 2×10 10 copies / mL ( median , 1 . 3×10 5 ) , and those in feces specimens from negative to 1 . 9×10 9 ( median , 7 . 1×10 3 ) . Of the 254 samples ( 9 EB samples , 8 EBC samples , 12 bedside air samples , 202 public / private surface samples from isolation rooms , and 23 feces - related air / surface / water samples ) , 14 tested positive , as summarized in Table 2 , suggesting the potential for nosocomial transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 via multiple routes . The viral RNA concentrations were 1112 copies / m 3 and 745 copies / m 3 respectively in the < 1 µm and > 4 µm fractions of the only positive air sample . The maximum viral RNA concentrations were 38 copies / cm 2 in sampled private surfaces of COVID patients ( excluding the toothbrush ) and 3092 copies / mL in sewage / wastewater samples . These findings prioritize areas for effective environmental disinfection practices to reduce virus transmission and support the need for strict adherence to personal hygiene . However , the positive detection rates and virus contents in these positive samples were relatively low , indicating that patients release limited virus particles into the environment more than 10 DAO . 3 . 2 . Potential of respiratory bioaerosols in transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 Respiratory droplets , or bioaerosols , are carriers of pathogens and are responsible for the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases . They are produced during expiratory activities such as coughing , sneezing , talking , and normal breathing . To test the potential of respiratory bioaerosol in transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 , 9 EB and 8 EBC specimens were collected from 15 patients between 13 and 43 DAO in the present study . The aerosol collection system in this study directly sampled patients’ EB before it was highly diluted by the room air , but all samples in three size fractions tested negative for viral RNA [ positive detection in sputum samples ; see Table 2 ] , though 10 forced coughs were performed by each patient . Two of the eight EBC samples tested positive for the virus ( Patients 9 and 17 ) , with the virus concentration as 216 . 0 copies / mL and 222 . 0 copies / mL , respectively . This detection rate was likely attributable to the high collection efficiency of both fine and coarse aerosols and the low possibility of dilution by air or viral transport medium . Furthermore , 1 ( Patient 9 ) of the 12 air samples from the patients’ bedsides ( 24 – 43 DAO ) tested positive ( sputum viral loads between negative and 4 . 5×10 5 copies / mL ) ; RNA was detected in two size fractions from that air sample , with virus concentrations of 1111 . 9 copies / m 3 and 744 . 6 copies / m 3 in the < 1 µm and > 4 µm fractions , respectively . One of the two positive EBC samples and the positive bedside air sample belonged to Patient 9 ; his sputum viral load values on the sampling date were 6 . 3×10 5 copies / mL and 3 . 2×10 5 copies / mL , respectively . These findings are consistent with a sampling event in two Wuhan hospitals where viral RNA in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated rooms was very low ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . In another sampling event with NIOSH samplers , viral RNA was readily detected from the air of isolation rooms where patients were at 5 D . A . O . ; the highest concentration was 1384 copies / m 3 and 2000 copies / m 3 in the 1 - 4 µm and > 4 µm fractions , respectively , and no viral RNA was detected in < 1 µm size fraction ( Chia et al . , 2020 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 Although some COVID - 19 patients evaluated during the later stage of infection in our study had a relatively high viral load in their sputum specimen , shedding of virus particles from the respiratory tract into the environment was limited , which is in agreement with previous findings that viral load in nasal or throat samples is high in the early stage of infection and decreases to a low level at around 9 DAO ( Woelfel et al . , 2020 ; Zou et al . , 2020 ) . Virus - laden respiratory droplets from the deep lung tend to deposit and accumulate into the respiratory mucous , but difficult to follow the respiratory airflow to enter the indoor environment ( Kleinstreuer and Zhang , 2010 ) . The transmission characteristics of SARS - CoV - 2 differ from those of SARS because the viral loads in the respiratory specimens of SARS - infected patients peak at 10 DAO ( Peiris et al . , 2003 ) , and considerable positive rates of surface swabs have been detected in SARS patients’ rooms at 5 - 15 DAO ( Dowell et al . , 2004 ) . However , the virus - shedding course of SARS - CoV - 2 is similar to that of influenza virus ( Tsang et al . , 2015 ; Zou et al . , 2020 ) , and the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler has also successfully detected influenza virus in samples of 32 out of 38 influenza - positive patients , 60 % of whom had symptom onset within 3 days ( Lindsley et al . , 2010 ) . This finding highlights the importance of early control measures for COVID - 19 patients and suggests a relief for medical staff working in isolation rooms and intensive care units with recovering ( later stage ) patients . 3 . 3 . Personal necessities function as potential vehicles for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission Surfaces may be contaminated by deposition of virus - laden droplets or by contact of patients’ hands , and lead to fomite transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Four of the 202 surface samples obtained from seven isolation rooms tested positive . These positive samples were from private surfaces of COVID - 19 patients , namely the towels of Patient 5 ( 9 copies / cm 2 ) and Patient 16 ( 35 copies / cm 2 ) , the toothbrush of Patient 15 ( 1045 viral RNA copies in total ) , and the bedside wall of Patient 18 ( 38 copies / cm 2 ) ( Table 2 ) . This positive detection can be attributed to contamination with J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 respiratory secretions . It is worth noting that although both sputum specimen of Patient 16 and 18 tested negative , viral RNA was still detected from their towel or room ( the bedside wall ) , which might be shed days ago . Viruses may survive on surfaces for hours to days and might infect susceptible individuals ( van Doremalen et al . , 2020 ) . The viral survival , the transmission efficiency of the virus from surfaces and hands to respiratory mucosa , and the dose - response rate after the virus is introduced onto the mucosa are all important factors that influence the exposure risk of the susceptible individuals . Our results are in line with that of a previous study that revealed that towels in hospitals are frequently contaminated with respiratory pathogens ( Hassan et al . , 2019 ) . These findings suggest that personal necessities function as potential vehicles for virus transmission . Therefore , measures that target the proper use of personal necessities , including avoidance of sharing with others , frequent cleaning with disinfectant , and hand hygiene practices after use , may help to limit virus transmission . Studies have reported much high positive rates from public surface samplings near COVID - 19 patients within 5 DAO ( Chia et al . , 2020 ; Ong et al . , 2020 ) . However , no viral RNA was detected from samples taken from frequently touched public surfaces in the isolation rooms over 7h after routine sanitization , further indicating limited transmission potential via the fomite route during our sampling period . In previous studies , viral RNA were readily detected from public surfaces in isolation rooms of patients in the early stage of infection ( Chia et al . , 2020 ; Ong et al . , 2020 ) . The viral loads of the sputum and feces specimen of 12 patients from the isolation rooms ( Table S1 ) in our study were negative – 4 . 5×10 5 copies / mL and negative – 3 . 7×10 4 copies / mL , respectively , on the sampling date . 3 . 4 . Potential of fecal - oral and fecal - aerosol routes in transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 COVID - 19 patients have a long virus shedding course in feces specimen , and viral RNA , even viable virus particles , has been detected in the feces - related specimens of patients with confirmed COVID - 19 ( Guan et al . , 2020 ; Tian et al . , 2020 ) . Moreover , previous studies have suggested that the viral loads of feces specimens peak late after the symptom onset and may last for a longer duration compared with those of respiratory specimens ( Xing et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , fecal - oral and fecal - aerosol transmission have been suspected as potential routes of SARS - CoV - 2 ( McDermott et al . , 2020 ; Tian et al . , 2020 ) . We sampled lavatory air , toilet bowl , floor drain and sewage , apart from the public lavatory surfaces as described above and in Figure S3 . Two of the six samples from toilet bowl after defecation and toilet flushing tested positive for the viral RNA , namely 4 copies / cm 2 and 2 copies / cm 2 , respectively ( viral loads for positive detection in the feces specimens , 2 . 1×10 5 copies / mL – 5 . 0×10 6 copies / mL ) . Further , one of six floor drain samples tested positive , with a viral concentration of 2 copies / cm 2 , indicating that virus - laden aerosol transmission by the drainage system ( as illustrated in Graphical Abstract ) is probable . None of the six lavatory aerosol samples tested positive ; although patients’ feces specimen were test high in viral loads , the toilet didn’t produce detectable amount of virus - laden aerosols in our sampling event . Moreover , four of the five water samples from the drainage system tested positive . The viral RNA concentration of the sewage is as high as 3092 copies / mL , but the sewage treatment station worked well to reduce it below the detection limit ( Figure S4 ) . The detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in the toilet bowl and sewage samples in this study is consistent with that finding , indicating high viral loads in the patients’ feces - related specimens . Notably , one sample from the floor drainage tested positive , which was probably contaminated by the virus - laden bioaerosols from the drainage system . The toilet flushing process produces large numbers of J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 bioaerosols in the sewage pipe , which may re - enter vertically - aligned lavatories in the same building through the floor drain . This likely explains the SARS cluster outbreak that occurred in Amoy Garden in 2003 ( Yu et al . , 2004 ) . 4 . Implications Our findings provide important health implications for the control of nosocomial infection and personal protection : ( 1 ) ensure good ventilation for each isolation ward to reduce the potential risk of transmission via aerosols ; ( 2 ) in addition to routine disinfection practices , perform frequent and thorough environmental cleaning and disinfection of areas not easy to clean ; ( 3 ) perform ventilation and disinfection after using the toilet to reduce aerosolization of virus and contamination of surrounding surfaces , and preserve tap water seals to prevent the re - entry of bioaerosols from pipes ; ( 4 ) do not share personal necessities , and disinfect and replace them regularly . However , the major limitation is that we only detected the presence of the nucleic acid ( RNA ) of SARS - CoV - 2 and did not perform viral culture due to the low virus quantity in the positive samples . The presence of nucleic acid does not confirm the existence of viable virus , nor does it indicate that fomite contact is an important route for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission .
