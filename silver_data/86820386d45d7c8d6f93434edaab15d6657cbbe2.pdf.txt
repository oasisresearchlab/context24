Here , using an atomic force microscope , we characterized changes in biophysical ( cell area , actin organization ) and biomechanical ( Young’s modulus , force of adhesion , tether force , membrane tension , tether radius ) aspects of human fetal brain - derived neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) induced by four classes of widely used toxic compounds , including rotenone , digoxin , N - arachidonoylethanolamide ( AEA ) , and chlorpyrifos , under exposure up to 36 h . The sub - cellular mechanisms ( apoptosis , mitochondria membrane potential , DNA damage , glutathione levels ) by which these toxicants induced bio - chemical changes in NPCs were assessed . Results suggest a significant compromise in cell viability with increasing toxicant concentration ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and biophysical and biomechanical characteristics with increasing exposure time ( p < 0 . 01 ) as well as toxicant concentration ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Impairment of mitochondrial membrane potential appears to be the most sensitive mechanism of neurotoxicity for rotenone , AEA and chlorpyrifos exposure , but compromise in plasma membrane integrity for digoxin exposure . The surviving NPCs remarkably retained stemness ( SOX2 expression ) even at high toxicant concen - trations . A negative linear correlation ( R 2 = 0 . 92 ) exists between the elastic modulus of surviving cells and the number of living cells in that environment . We propose that even subtle compromise in cell mechanics could serve as a crucial marker of developmental neurotoxicity ( mechanotoxicology ) and therefore should be included as part of toxicology assessment repertoire to characterize as well as predict developmental outcomes . Keywords Developmental neurotoxicity · Neural stem cells · Insecticides · AEA · Chlorpyrifos · Multi - variable logistic regression · Mechanotoxicology Introduction During central nervous system ( CNS ) development , the large reservoirs of neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) in the ventricu - lar and subventricular zones decline with maturation and aging . For instance , the large NPC population in neural crest and neural spinal tube dramatically declined to ≤ 1 % postnatal in a rat embryogenesis model , highlighting the role of NPCs and their microhabitat in normal embryogen - esis ( Ladran et al . 2013 ; Rammensee et al . 2017 ) . NPCs are self - renewing , multi - potent cells which can differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages . CNS development is a complex process comprising several highly coordinated events such as migration , differentiation , proliferation , cell death , myeli - nation , and synthesis of neurotransmitters ( Xu et al . 2017 ) , which occur in a well - defined time - frame , making each event differentially vulnerable on exposure to harmful com - pounds . Any perturbation during CNS development could lead to permanent damage with little chance to repair . Epi - demiological studies have detailed the role of environmental chemicals and clinical drugs on neurological disorders such as learning disabilities , lowered IQ , cognitive dysfunction , impaired verbal skills , and poor perceptual and motor skills ( Lee et al . 2016 ; Malik et al . 2014 ) .

This has prompted the need to methodically screen a range of widely known environmental and pharmaceutical compounds for their potential neurodevelopmental toxicity . Animal models have been widely used to flag compounds for toxicological identification . In the field of reproductive and developmen - tal toxicology , higher number of experimental animals are typically used , mostly for statistical significance purposes ( Bjorling - Poulsen et al . 2008 ) . Since animal models are xen - ogeneic , expensive , poorly predictive of human outcomes , and ethically and morally contentious , demand for alterna - tive in vitro test methods has been growing . In the absence of developmentally relevant fresh primary brain cells , immor - talized cell lines such as embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) , induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) , primary tropho - blast cells , NPCs , and primary neurons are being explored to elucidate neurotoxicity of various classes of compounds ( Bal - Price et al . 2010 ; Ebert et al . 2012 ) . However , current in vitro tests focus mostly on biochemical assays to assess the toxicity , while important changes in biophysical and biomechanical characteristics of these progenitor cells were rarely studied ( Liu et al . 2015 ; Wu et al . 2012 ) . CNS development is a tightly regulated process , from maturation of neurons to folding of the brain , and relies heavily on mechanical forces and biochemical cues ( Franze 2013 ) . For instance , radial glial cells clonally linked to NPCs act as a mechanical scaffold for cell migration during brain formation ( Barnes et al . 2017 ) , highlighting the impor - tance of intrinsic cellular mechanical characteristics such as membrane tension in organizing motility , cell shape , and mechanotransduction ( Diz - Munoz et al . 2013 ) . Perturbations to cellular biophysical aspects could change the coupling between cellular intrinsic forces and matrix mechanical properties , causing abnormal mechanotransduction ( Kolahi and Mofrad 2010 ) . Cell mechanics is gaining traction as an important biomarker of cell differentiation , pathophysi - ology , and cancer progression ( Li et al . 2008 ; Liang et al . 2016 ; Liu et al . 2015 ; Qiu et al . 2010 ) . The biomechanics of various cell types has been explored using optical tweezers , micropipette aspiration , magnetic twisting cytometry , and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , among others ( Lins et al . 2018 ; Pillarisetti et al . 2011 ; Yim et al . 2010 ; Yokokawa et al . 2008 ) . The utility of AFM to study the mechanical properties of individual cells under pathological and toxi - cant - aberrant conditions is gaining attention ( Angely et al . 2017 ; Gavara and Chadwick 2012 ; Kim et al . 2012 ; Pastrana et al . 2019 ) . However , characterization of the changes in biophysical and biomechanical properties and correlation of the biomechanical and biochemical outcomes after toxicants exposure remain unexplored . Since biochemical and biomechanical cues play an inte - gral role in regulating fetal development ( Wozniak and Chen 2009 ) , in this work , we used human fetal NPCs to evaluate the cytotoxic potential of various classes of compounds on developmental neurotoxicity . We evaluated the sub - cellular mechanisms of action of rotenone , digoxin , chlorpyrifos , and arachidonoylethanolamide ( AEA ) over a wide range of concentrations . These four compounds have been selected for their toxic potential in various in vitro and in vivo con - ditions , although the extent of their prior testing was con - fined to quantifying IC 50 or LD 50 levels ( Bal - Price et al . 2010 ; Bjorling - Poulsen et al . 2008 ; Dubovicky et al . 2008 ; Giordano and Costa 2012 ; Movsesyan et al . 2004 ; Tamm and Ceccatelli 2017 ) . Using AFM , we not only quantified the changes in physical and mechanical properties of NPCs treated with these compounds , but also correlated the bio - chemical outcomes with biomechanical characteristics of cells . Materials and methods Cell culture and compound exposure Human NPCs ( ReNcell VM ; SCC008 ; EMD Millipore , Burlington , MA , USA ) were maintained in an undifferenti - ated state by culturing in a complete medium ( ReNcell main - tenance medium ; SCM005 ; EMD Millipore ) supplemented with 20 ng / mL each of bFGF and EGF , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin , on laminin - coated flasks . Stock solutions of rotenone , digoxin , and chlorpyrifos were prepared in DMSO at 10 mM , while AEA was prepared in ethanol at 10 mM . Unless specified otherwise , all the compounds , growth fac - tors , and solvents were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . The working concentrations of the com - pounds were prepared by serial dilution of stock solutions in DMSO and followed by dilution in the complete medium . Cell viability measurement ReNcell VM was cultured in 96 - well tissue - culture plates at a density of 15 × 10 3 cells / well and exposed to a range of concentrations of the four individual compounds for 24 h . A Live / Dead ® viability / cytotoxicity kit ( Thermo Fisher Scien - tific , Waltham , MA , USA ) was used to evaluate the effect of each compound on cell survival ( n = 4 wells / concentration / compound ) ( Tasneem et al . 2016 ) . Images of cells in indi - vidual wells were acquired using an automated fluorescent microscope ( S + scanner , Samsung Eletro - Mechanics , Co . ( SEMCO ) , South Korea ) . ( Details in supplementary meth - ods ) ( Joshi et al . 2018b ) . Archives of Toxicology 1 3 Assays for cellular mechanisms of toxicity All assays were performed with an initial seeding density of 15 × 10 3 cells / well . Additional details for these methods , where necessary , were provided in supplementary methods . DNA damage After 24 h of compound exposure , surviving cells ( n = 4 wells / concentration / compound ) were stained with 15 µM of Hoechst 33342 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; Ex - 352 nm / Em - 416 nm ) in 1 × PBS ( pH ~ 7 . 2 ) for 30 min to assess changes in nucleic DNA content . Nuclei were imaged using the S + scanner with a 4 × objective and a blue fluorescence filter from Semrock ( DAPI - 5060C - 000 ) ( Joshi et al . 2018b ) . Mitochondrial membrane potential assay Mitochondrial impairment , i . e . , changes in mitochondrial membrane potential , in the presence of the compounds was assessed using tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester ( TMRM ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ; Ex - 545 nm / Em - 600 nm ) . The cells were stained with 0 . 5 µM of TMRM after 24 h of compound exposure and imaged using the S + scanner with a 4 × objec - tive and an orange filter from Semrock ( TxRed - 4040C - 000 ) ( Joshi et al . 2018b ) . YO‑PRO®‑1 assay to identify apoptotic cells YO - PRO ® - 1 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; Ex - 491 nm / Em - 509 nm ) identifies apoptotic cells via nucleic acid binding . Apoptotic cells are permeant to YO - PRO ® - 1 , but non - permeant to propidium iodide which could stain only dead cells . After 24 h of compound exposure , live cells ( n = 4 wells / concentration / compound ) were incubated with 5 µM of YO - PRO ® - 1 for 30 min . Using a Zeiss Axio Vert . A1 inverted fluorescence microscope ( Thornwood , NY , USA ) , at least 10 images were taken at random locations in each well . The fold change in number of apoptotic cells in toxicant exposed cases was calculated by normalizing it to controls . Intracellular glutathione levels ReNcell VM ( n = 4 wells / concentration / compound ) was stained with 50 µM of monochlorobimane ( mBCl ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ; Ex - 394 nm / Em - 490 nm ) after 24 h com - pound exposure to determine the levels of intracellular glutathione ( GSH ) , which provides an indirect measure of cellular defense against oxidative stress . Lower GSH levels are associated with increased concentrations of glutathione disulfide ( GSSG ) leading to a decrease in GSH / GSSG ratio , a critical indicator of cellular health . The cells were imaged at 4 × magnification using the S + scanner with the blue filter ( Joshi et al . 2018b ) . Biophysical and biomechanical measurements using AFM ReNcell VM at a seeding density of 1 . 5 × 10 5 cells was cultured in laminin - coated 50 mm AFM - specific petri dishes for 24 h and exposed to compounds for up to 36 h . All measurements were made using a MFP - 3D - Bio atomic force microscope ( AFM ; Oxford Instruments , Santa Barbara , CA , USA ) mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti ; Melville , NY , USA ) . Tip - less AFM canti - levers ( Arrow™ TL1 , Nanoworld , nominal spring constant - 0 . 03 N / m ) were modified by attaching a 4 . 5 - μm polystyrene bead using epoxy as explained earlier ( Joshi et al . 2018a ) . The cells were maintained at 37 °C throughout the live - cell nanoindentation assay . For each experiment , 50 – 60 cells were randomly selected , and force curves were obtained between nucleus and cell margin at approach / retraction velocity of 5 µm / s . At least 60 force – indentation curves were obtained for each group of the cells ( controls and compound - treated ; 4 , 12 , 24 , and 36 h ) . Using Hertz’s contact model , the Young’s modulus was determined from the force – inden - tation curves as F = 4 E Y √ R 𝛿 3 ∕ 3 � 1 − 𝜇 2 � , where F is inden - tation force , E Y is Young’s modulus , µ is Poisson’s ratio ( 0 . 5 for cells ) , R is tip radius ( 2 . 25 µm ) and δ is indentation depth ( ~ 500 nm ) . The force required to separate AFM tip and cell surface describes the adhesion or force of adhesion ( F ad ) . The tether forces ( F T ) were directly calculated from the series of force steps in the retraction curve . The average noise of 50 pN was set as a threshold of tether force and only forces higher than threshold was considered as actual rup - ture events . The apparent membrane tension ( T M ) , the force needed to deform a membrane , was calculated from tether forces using T M ≈ F 2T ∕ 8 𝜋 2 K B , where K B is the bending stiff - ness which lies in the range of 0 . 1 – 0 . 3 pN . µm ( Diz - Munoz et al . 2013 ; Diz - Munoz et al . 2010 ; Hochmuth et al . 1996 ) . Similarly , R T ( tether radius ) , which describes the connection between plasma membrane and cytoskeleton , was calculated from the tether forces as R T ≈ 2 𝜋 K B ∕ F T ( additional details in Supplementary Methods ) . SOX2 staining for undifferentiated ReNcell VM After 24 h of compound exposure , ReNcell VM was washed twice with 1 × PBS , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min , washed twice with 1 × PBS for 5 min each , and incubated with a permeabilizing / blocking buffer solution containing 5 % goat serum and 0 . 5 % Triton - X in PBS for 30 min . After removing the permeabilizing / blocking buffer solution , the cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti - SOX2 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 4 h . The cells Archives of Toxicology 1 3 were washed twice with 1 × PBS and incubated with goat anti - mouse FITC secondary antibody ( 1 : 100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) for 2 h at room temperature . The cells were washed twice with PBS , incubated with DAPI for 10 min , and washed once with PBS before imaging . At least five images were taken at random locations in each well using a 10 × objective on the inverted fluorescence microscope ( Zeiss Axio Vert A1 ) . Actin staining After 4 , 12 , 24 , and 36 h of compound exposure , ReNcell VM was washed once with 1 × PBS , fixed with 4 % PFA for 40 min , washed twice with PBS for 5 min , and incubated with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min . The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with actin - staining Alexa Flour 488 Phalloidin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 25 min at room temperature . After removing the staining solution , the cells were washed twice with PBS for 5 min and incubated with DAPI for 10 min before imaging . Images were taken at random locations using a 20 × objective on the inverted fluorescence microscope . The images were used to calculate changes in cell area using ImageJ . Statistical analysis Data were represented as mean ± standard error from at least n = 4 wells / condition , with at least three independent repeats of each assay , and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 . Data analysis was performed using one - way and two - way ANOVA , based on the number of groups compared , followed by Tukey multiple comparison or Bon - ferroni post hoc test , to find statistically significant differ - ences between the groups . p < 0 . 05 deemed statistically sig - nificant . Multivariate logistic regression of the parameters contributing to NPC health was performed using R software ( version 3 . 5 . 2 ) . Results Biochemical and biomechanical effects of rotenone exposure To investigate the cytotoxic potential of rotenone on human NPCs , ReNcell VM was exposed to a range of rotenone concentrations ( 0 . 1 – 25 µM ) for 24 h . A dose - dependent decrease in cell viability was observed with a calculated IC 50 value of 0 . 27 ± 0 . 01 µM ( Fig . 1a ) . To elucidate the subcellular mechanisms of rotenone toxicity , damage to nucleic DNA ( IC 50 ≅ 0 . 28 ± 0 . 01 µM ) and mitochondria ( IC 50 ≅ 0 . 22 ± 0 . 01 µM ) , as well as changes in glutathione levels ( IC 50 ≅ 0 . 33 ± 0 . 02 µM ) were assessed ( Fig . 1b ) . An increase in the number of apoptotic cells by YO - PRO ® - 1 staining was noted at ≤ 0 . 78 µM concentration , beyond which necrosis might be dominating the mechanism of cell death ( Fig . 1c ) . Based on these IC 50 values , mitochondrial impairment seems to be the dominant mechanism by which rotenone influences a compromise in NPC health ( p < 0 . 01 vs . other mechanisms ; Supplementary Figure 3 ) . However , no significant changes in SOX2 expression were noted in the surviving and adherent ReNcell VM upon rotenone exposure ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . No significant changes in the biophysical and biome - chanical characteristics ( E Y , F ad , F T ) of ReNcell VM were noted in control cultures at 4 , 12 , 24 and 36 h time points ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . The baseline properties of control ReNcell VM were : E Y = 5 . 04 ± 0 . 16 kPa , F ad = 2 . 47 ± 0 . 03 nN , F T = 329 ± 3 . 2 pN , T M = 13 . 9 ± 0 . 27 pN / μm , and R T = 1 . 9 ± 0 . 01 nm . The mechanical properties of control ReNcell VM at the 24 - h time point were used as a reference vs . test cases . Significant decreases in E Y , F ad , F T , and T M with concomitant increases in R T were noted , as a function of increasing exposure duration ( p < 0 . 001 vs . controls ) and toxicant concentration ( p < 0 . 001 vs . controls ) in ReNcell VM exposed to rotenone ( Fig . 1d – h ) . Significant concen - tration - dependent differences in biomechanical and bio - physical characteristics of ReNcell VM were noted at every time point , while such differences were more pronounced at higher concentrations with increasing exposure time . ReNcell VM was immunolabeled for actin to detect potential alterations to cytoskeletal structure in the cells treated with varying rotenone up to 36 h ( Fig . 5a ) . While NPCs appeared more spread with distinguishable actin filaments in control cultures , even after 36 h , an exposure duration – concentration - dependent compromise in cellular morphology was evident in rotenone - exposed cultures . Sig - nificant actin reorganization with more protein aggregation at the periphery and depletion in the cytoplasm was noted with rotenone addition . Similarly , the average cellular area of ReNcell VM ( ~ 1650 μm 2 ) significantly decreased at all rotenone concentrations tested and at every time point ( Fig . 5b ) . Biochemical and biomechanical effects of digoxin exposure A concentration - dependent decrease in ReNcell VM via - bility was noted after 24 h exposure to range of digoxin concentrations ( 0 . 2 – 50 µM ) , with IC 50 ≈ 0 . 56 ± 0 . 01 µM ( Fig . 2a ) . The mechanisms by which digoxin induced cellular damage was assessed by quantifying changes in DNA ( IC 50 ≈ 2 . 02 ± 0 . 09 µM ) and mitochondria ( IC 50 ≈ 0 . 94 ± 0 . 02 µM ) , and intracellular glutathione levels ( IC 50 ≈ 0 . 84 ± 0 . 02 µM ) ( Fig . 2b ) . Based on these IC 50 val - ues , plasma membrane integrity ( Live / Dead ® assay ) seems Archives of Toxicology 1 3 to be the dominant mechanism by which ReNcell VM is influenced by digoxin ( p < 0 . 01 vs . other mechanisms ; Sup - plementary Figure 3 ) . An increase in the number of apop - totic cells was observed at ≤ 0 . 39 µM digoxin ( Fig . 2c ) , and no changes in SOX2 expression were observed within sur - viving and undetached ReNcell VM upon digoxin exposure at ≤ IC 50 concentrations ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Similar to the trends noted for rotenone exposure , sig - nificant decreases in E Y , F ad , F T , and T M with concomitant increases in R T was noted with increasing digoxin concen - tration ( p < 0 . 001 vs . controls ) and exposure time ( p < 0 . 001 vs . controls ) ( Fig . 2d – h ) . At a fixed digoxin concentration , significant differences in the observed properties were noted with increasing exposure duration ; similarly , at every time point tested , significant differences in mechanical and physical characteristics were evident with increasing digoxin concentration . Significant digoxin concentration and expo - sure time - dependent loss in actin meshwork and cytoskel - eton reorganization were evident in ReNcell VM ( Fig . 5a ) . Except for 0 . 14 μM concentration and 4 h treatment , digoxin exposure significantly compromised the cellular area at all concentrations and time points tested vs . controls ( Fig . 5c ) . Biochemical and biomechanical effects of AEA exposure A concentration - dependent decrease in cell viability with IC 50 ≈ 8 ± 0 . 13 μM was noted ( Fig . 3a ) upon ReNcell VM exposure to a range of AEA concentrations ( 0 . 11 – 30 µM ) . The mechanisms by which AEA influences ReNcell VM was assessed by quantifying changes in intracel - lular glutathione levels ( IC 50 ≈ 6 . 4 ± 0 . 33 µM ) , DNA Fig . 1 ReNCell VM was exposed to a range of rotenone concentra - tions ( 0 . 1 – 25 µM ) for 24 h . Concentration - dependent cell survival ( a ) , DNA damage , mitochondrial impairment , and changes in intra - cellular glutathione levels ( b ) , and apoptosis - induced cell death ( c ) in rotenone - exposed cultures . The transition from apoptosis to necrosis as the mechanism of death is marked for visualization . Biomechani - cal characteristics such as elastic modulus ( d ) , force of adhesion ( e ) , tether force ( f ) , apparent membrane tension ( g ) , and radius of tether ( h ) were quantified at various time points ( 4 , 12 , 24 , and 36 h ) and rotenone concentrations ( 0 , 0 . 06 , 0 . 13 , and 0 . 27 µM ) using AFM , and reported as average ± standard error . Representative force – indenta - tion curves obtained from control and rotenone - exposed cells were shown in the inset in panel D . Elastic modulus was calculated by applying Hertz model to force – indentation curves ( n ≥ 45 cells / con - dition ) obtained from control and rotenone - exposed cells . Membrane tether forces ( F T ; n ≥ 50 cells / condition ) , apparent membrane tension ( T M ≈ F 2T ∕ 8 𝜋 2 K B ) , and tether radius ( R T ≈ 2 𝜋 K B ∕ F T ) were measured by retraction of beaded - AFM probe from the cell surface . Here K B is the bending modulus , ≈ 0 . 1 pN . μm for lipid layers . Representative adhesive and tether forces obtained from force – indentation curves were shown in the insets in e and f Archives of Toxicology 1 3 damage ( IC 50 ≈ 11 . 4 ± 0 . 23 µM ) , and mitochondrial dam - age ( IC 50 ≈ 4 . 3 ± 0 . 16 µM ) ( Fig . 3b ) . Based on these IC 50 values , changes in mitochondrial membrane potential seems to be the dominant mechanism by which AEA affects ReN - cell VM ( p < 0 . 01 vs . other mechanisms ; Supplementary Figure 3 ) . Apoptosis seems to be dominant mechanism up to 0 . 48 µM of AEA ( Fig . 3c ) . NPC differentiation was not noted in AEA - exposed cultures , as evident from SOX2 expression in surviving cells ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Significant decreases in E Y , F ad , F T , and T M and increase in R T over 36 h ( p < 0 . 001 vs . controls ) and higher AEA concentrations ( p < 0 . 001 vs . controls ) were noted ( Fig . 3d – h ) . At every time point tested , significant compro - mise in mechanical properties of ReNcell VM was noted with increasing AEA concentrations . Similarly , signifi - cant changes in biomechanical characteristics of ReNcell VM were observed with increasing exposure duration at a fixed AEA concentration . AEA exposure led to time and concentration - dependent upregulation in F - actin degradation and cytoskeleton reorganization ( Fig . 5a ) , and significant compromises in the cell area ( Fig . 5d ) . Biochemical and biomechanical effects of chlorpyrifos exposure When ReNcell VM was treated with chlorpyrifos ( 0 . 1 – 50 μM ) , a concentration - dependent decrease in cell viability was observed with IC 50 ≈ 9 . 9 ± 0 . 17 μM ( Fig . 4a ) . The subcellular mechanisms of chlorpyrifos toxicity were assessed by quantifying changes in mitochondrial mem - brane potential ( IC 50 ≈ 5 . 5 ± 0 . 23 µM ) , nucleic DNA dam - age ( IC 50 ≈ 11 . 6 ± 0 . 45 µM ) , and intracellular glutathione levels ( IC 50 ≈ 8 . 25 ± 0 . 25 µM ) ( Fig . 4b ) . Based on these IC 50 values , mitochondrial damage seems to be the domi - nant mechanism by which chlorpyrifos influences a compro - mise in ReNcell VM health ( p < 0 . 01 vs . other mechanisms ; Fig . 2 ReNCell VM was exposed to a range of digoxin concentra - tions ( 0 . 2 – 50 µM ) for 24 h . Concentration - dependent cell survival ( a ) , DNA damage , mitochondrial impairment , and changes in intra - cellular glutathione levels ( b ) , and apoptosis - induced cell death ( c ) in digoxin - exposed cultures . The transition from apoptosis to necrosis as the mechanism of death is marked for visualization . Biomechani - cal characteristics such as elastic modulus ( d ) , force of adhesion ( e ) , tether force ( f ) , apparent membrane tension ( g ) , and radius of tether ( h ) were quantified at various time points ( 4 , 12 , 24 , and 36 h ) and digoxin concentrations ( 0 , 0 . 14 , 0 . 28 , and 0 . 56 µM ) using AFM , and reported as average ± standard error . Elastic modulus was calculated by applying Hertz model to force – indentation curves ( n ≥ 45 cells / condition ) obtained from control and digoxin - exposed cells . Mem - brane tether forces ( F T ; n ≥ 50 cells / condition ) , apparent membrane tension ( T M ≈ F 2T ∕ 8 𝜋 2 K B ) , and tether radius ( R T ≈ 2 𝜋 K B ∕ F T ) were measured by retraction of beaded - AFM probe from the cell surface Archives of Toxicology 1 3 Supplementary Figure 3 ) . An increase in the number of apoptotic cells was noted up to 0 . 78 µM chlorpyrifos , after which necrosis might be dominant ( Fig . 4c ) . No changes in SOX2 expression were evident upon chlorpyrifos exposure ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . A concentration – time - dependent decrease ( p < 0 . 001 vs . controls ) in E Y , F ad , F T , and T M and concomitant increase in R T ( p < 0 . 001 vs . controls ) of ReNcell VM were observed upon exposure to chlorpyrifos ( Fig . 4d – h ) . At a fixed chlor - pyrifos concentration , a significant drop in biophysical and biomechanical characteristics of ReNcell VM was observed with increasing time . Similarly , at every exposure time point tested , a significant decrease in ReNcell VM biomechanics was observed with increasing concentration . Finally , grad - ual changes in cytoskeleton organization with actin down - regulation ( Fig . 5a ) and shrinkage of the cell area ( Fig . 5e ) were observed with increasing chlorpyrifos concentration and exposure time . Discussion Recent studies have demonstrated vulnerability of a devel - oping fetus when it encounters even trace amounts of envi - ronmental toxicants which are harmless to most adults ( Landrigan and Goldman 2011 ) . The developing CNS is susceptible to damage by exposure to toxicants primarily due to the still immature blood – brain barrier . Since NPCs are among the most sensitive cell types , they are commonly used as model cells to screen compounds for their neurotoxic potential . A few recent studies , including from our group , have evaluated the role of various toxicants ( e . g . , heavy met - als , pharmaceutical compounds , PCBs ) on the sensitivity of immortalized and primary NPCs isolated from various species ( e . g . , murine , human ) ( Tamm and Ceccatelli 2017 ; Tasneem et al . 2016 ) . Since insulating NPCs from toxic insult during embryogenesis is crucial not only for proper CNS development , but also during later stages of life , the Fig . 3 ReNCell VM was exposed to a range of AEA concentrations ( 0 . 11 – 30 µM ) for 24 h . Concentration - dependent cell survival ( a ) , DNA damage , mitochondrial impairment , and changes in intracel - lular glutathione levels ( b ) , and apoptosis - induced cell death ( c ) in AEA - exposed cultures . The transition from apoptosis to necrosis as the mechanism of death is marked for visualization . Biomechani - cal characteristics such as elastic modulus ( d ) , force of adhesion ( e ) , tether force ( f ) , apparent membrane tension ( g ) , and radius of tether ( h ) were quantified at various time points ( 4 , 12 , 24 , and 36 h ) and AEA concentrations ( 0 , 2 , 4 , and 8 µM ) using AFM , and reported as average ± standard error . Elastic modulus was calculated by apply - ing Hertz model to force – indentation curves ( n ≥ 45 cells / condi - tion ) obtained from control and AEA - exposed cells . Membrane tether forces ( F T ; n ≥ 50 cells / condition ) , apparent membrane tension ( T M ≈ F 2T ∕ 8 𝜋 2 K B ) , and tether radius ( R T ≈ 2 𝜋 K B ∕ F T ) were measured by retraction of beaded - AFM probe from the cell surface Archives of Toxicology 1 3 goal of this study is to screen a variety of compounds used in daily lives for their cytotoxic potential on NPCs , evaluate the sub - cellular mechanisms by which these compounds induce damage to these cells , elucidate the biomechanical and bio - physical changes in these cells upon toxicant exposure , and finally correlate the biochemical and biophysical changes . To our knowledge , we report here for the first time on the biophysical and biomechanical changes in human NPCs upon exposure to toxic compounds , including the four com - pounds tested . Specifically , we here show that although most cells survived for more than 24 h at very low dosages of the compounds ( e . g . , 0 . 25 × IC 50 ) , their mechanical properties were severely compromised even after 4 h of incubation . Rotenone , a plant - derived product and commonly used as an insecticide , blocks electron flow from NADH to co - enzyme Q . Prior studies reported on the IC 50 values of rote - none ( 0 . 02 – 200 μM ) depending on the cell type ( Murtaza et al . 2016 ) , and rotenone - induced apoptosis on various in vitro platforms ( Li et al . 2005 ; Seoposengwe et al . 2013 ) . We observed a concentration - dependent NPC death upon rotenone exposure , and found NPCs to be the most sensi - tive to mitochondrial damage as reported by others ( Gomez et al . 2007 ) . Similar results were observed when neuroblas - tomas were exposed to rotenone , leading to reduction in intracellular ROS and decreased intracellular glutathione levels , both contributing to apoptosis ( Seoposengwe et al . 2013 ) . NPCs exposed to rotenone showed caspase 9 / 3 inde - pendent apoptosis , a time - dependent release of cytochrome c and apoptosis - inducing factor , following mitochondrial depolarization - based increase in ROS generation , leading to apoptosis ( Li et al . 2005 ) . Despite such information , the biophysical and biomechanical changes induced by rotenone on NPCs ( or other cells ) remained unexplored . Digoxin is one of the most widely used cardiac medica - tions recommended by the American Heart Association , although it does not have a favorable efficacy and safety Fig . 4 ReNCell VM was exposed to a range of chlorpyrifos concen - trations ( 0 . 1 – 50 µM ) for 24 h . Concentration - dependent cell survival ( a ) , DNA damage , mitochondrial impairment , and changes in intra - cellular glutathione levels ( b ) , and apoptosis - induced cell death ( c ) in chlorpyrifos - exposed cultures . The transition from apoptosis to necrosis as the mechanism of death is marked for visualization . Bio - mechanical characteristics such as elastic modulus ( d ) , force of adhe - sion ( e ) , tether force ( f ) , apparent membrane tension ( g ) , and radius of tether ( h ) were quantified at various time points ( 4 , 12 , 24 , and 36 h ) and chlorpyrifos concentrations ( 0 , 2 . 5 , 4 . 9 , and 9 . 8 µM ) using AFM , and reported as average ± standard error . Elastic modulus was calcu - lated by applying Hertz model to force – indentation curves ( n ≥ 45 cells / condition ) obtained from control and AEA - exposed cells . Mem - brane tether forces ( F T ; n ≥ 50 cells / condition ) , apparent membrane tension ( T M ≈ F 2T ∕ 8 𝜋 2 K B ) , and tether radius ( R T ≈ 2 𝜋 K B ∕ F T ) were measured by retraction of beaded - AFM probe from the cell surface Archives of Toxicology 1 3 profile . Various studies have evaluated digoxin’s neu - rotoxic potential ( Hoffmann et al . 2010 ; Svensson et al . 2005 ) and found that to be toxic to human NPCs but not rat NPCs ; similar data was obtained for other cardiac gly - cosides ( Malik et al . 2014 ) . Digoxin was also reported to be toxic to iPSCs , neurons and fetal astrocytes ( Svensson et al . 2005 ) . Cells exposed to digoxin showed a distinct morphology which can be correlated to its mechanisms of toxicity . Digoxin was found to have an inhibiting action on neuroblastoma growth in vitro , and on the growth of murine or human neuroblastoma in vivo ( Svensson et al . 2005 ) . In agreement with previous studies ( Arispe et al . 2008 ; Gardner et al . 1973 ) , our results have shown a com - promise in membrane integrity upon digoxin exposure , leading to dose - dependent cytotoxicity . This specificity of digoxin on cells of CNS origin suggests an urgent need for in - depth testing of its developmental neurotoxicity ( Hoff - mann et al . 2010 ) . Chlorpyrifos is one of the most widely investigated organophosphates for developmental neurotoxicity ( Lee et al . 2016 ) , and its regulation and usage remain highly con - troversial . Despite much work done to evaluate the toxic effects of chlorpyrifos , the underlying mechanism remains unknown , which projects an urgent need for better assays to elucidate the toxic nature of chlorpyrifos ( Giordano and Costa 2012 ; Gohner et al . 2014 ; Slotkin et al . 2012 ) . The IC 50 value of chlorpyrifos we obtained is in the range of previous studies ( 0 . 8 – 56 μM ) noted in human brain cells ( Burke et al . 2017 ; Eaton et al . 2008 ) . Studies have shown the effects of chlorpyrifos not only during early stages of brain development in murine models , but also in the later stages of brain development . For instance , chlorpyrifos Fig . 5 a Representative immu - nofluorescence images of ReN - Cell VM showing morphologi - cal changes , i . e . , reorganization of F - actin mesh network , in the presence of various toxicants , over 36 h exposure . Cellular area was quantified at various concentrations of rotenone ( b ) , digoxin ( c ) , AEA ( d ) , and chlor - pyrifos ( e ) , over a 36 - h period . Scale bar : 25 µm Archives of Toxicology 1 3 was shown to induce neurobehavioral abnormalities dur - ing second and third postnatal weeks in rats , which cor - responds to human neonatal stages ( Bjorling - Poulsen et al . 2008 ) . Chronic exposure of chlorpyrifos has been linked to neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits , with glial cells more susceptible than neurons ( Bal - Price et al . 2010 ) . It has been reported that oxidative stress , inflammation , and / or irreversible neuropathies might be the mechanisms involved in such chronic exposure . Experimental studies utilizing rodent models showed that pre - and post - natal exposure of chlorpyrifos leads to alternation in many cel - lular processes , including proliferation and DNA replication ( Giordano and Costa 2012 ) . Various studies have shown the differential effect of chlorpyrifos exposure ; in vitro models suggested an increase in neuronal apoptotic process and a decrease in glial proliferation ( Giordano and Costa 2012 ; Gohner et al . 2014 ) . In our study , mitochondrial impairment and glutathione depletion by oxidative stress are the main mechanisms of chlorpyrifos - induced cytotoxicity along with apoptosis , in agreement with previous studies ( Salama et al . 2014 ; Yamada et al . 2017 ) . In recent years there has been a spike in the use of rec - reational drugs and other cannabis . The biologically active compound of cannabis , Δ9 - tetrahydrocannabinol , affects by binding to cannabinoid receptors . The long - term motor defects in the offspring and involvement of these com - pounds in neural differentiation was reported ( Contassot et al . 2004a , b ) . The use ( abuse ) of these compounds during pregnancy poses an existential threat to the developing fetus . However , lack of pertinent data dictates an urgent need to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic poten - tial of AEA ( Contassot et al . 2004a , b ) . Most of these rec - reational drugs are cationic lipophilic molecules which can readily cross placenta and blood – brain barrier to influence amniotic fluid and fetal tissues ( Movsesyan et al . 2004 ) . On the other hand , some studies have shown the neuroprotective nature of endocannabinoids , both in vivo and in vitro . AEA offered protective biological effects after brain injury and in neuronal cultures mimicking ischemic conditions , making them a valuable target for drug discovery . Our results show a dose - dependent AEA - induced cell death in NPC cultures , with mitochondrial damage driving the mechanism of cell sensitivity to AEA below IC 50 levels , followed by intracel - lular glutathione levels . Apart from their neuroprotective effects , studies have shown the cytotoxic effects of AEA in cortical and hippocampal neuron cultures , mainly mediated by caspase - 3 dependent apoptosis and ROS generation ( Cer - nak et al . 2004 ) . Using YO - PRO ® - 1 assay which only stains for apoptotic cells , we observed an increase in apoptotic cells up to a certain concentration for each toxicant tested , followed by a decrease in cells staining positive for apoptotic marker , although cell death continued to monotonically rise with increasing toxicant concentration . While the crosstalk between signaling networks involved in the mechanisms of cell death ( apoptosis vs . necrosis ) could not be completely decoupled , numerous studies attest to the role of apopto - sis as the dominant mechanism at low concentrations and necrosis taking over that role at higher dosages of a variety of toxicants ( Messner et al . 2012 ; O’Brien et al . 2000 ; Yeung et al . 1999 ; Zaucke et al . 1998 ) , similar to that noted in our studies . Exposure of cigarette smoke condensate led to acti - vation of p53 - mediated activation of apoptotic signaling at low concentrations and interruption in apoptotic signaling leading to necrosis at higher concentrations ( Messner et al . 2012 ) . Similarly , lower taxol concentrations led to block - ing of mitosis and onset of apoptosis whereas higher levels led to microtubule polymerization and necrosis induction ( Yeung et al . 1999 ) . A hallmark of necrosis is the loss of membrane integrity ( Li and Zhou 2015 ; Sachet et al . 2017 ) . Our AFM analysis showed that apparent membrane tension decreased with both increasing concentration and exposure time ( Figs . 1g , 2g , 3g , 4g ) , indicating loss of membrane integrity and induction of necrosis . To our knowledge , there is no existing literature on the characterization of cellular biomechanics of human NPCs , nor the effect of these four compounds on biomechani - cal characteristics of any cell types . Therefore , our study addresses a critical gap in literature and establishes a base - line for biochemical and biophysical changes in NPCs in the presence of toxicants . Our results showed a significant effect of toxicant exposure on cellular elasticity , adhesion , tether forces , radius of tether , and membrane tension , com - pared to untreated NPCs . The elastic modulus of NPCs decreased by ~ 80 % upon exposure to 0 . 27 µM of rotenone for 24 h . In select cases , prolonged exposure of lower toxi - cant concentrations showed similar effects on biomechanical properties as short - term exposure at higher concentrations , suggesting the need to extend the extent of toxicity testing beyond IC 50 values . Two - way ANOVA revealed significant primary effects of concentration ( p < 0 . 001 ) , exposure time ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and interaction between concentration and expo - sure time ( p < 0 . 001 ) on NPCs for all the compounds tested . We correlated the change in Young’s modulus to cell death measured from the most sensitive mechanistic assay ( e . g . , mitochondrial impairment ) , pooled for all four dif - ferent neurotoxicants ( Fig . 6 ) . A strong negative correla - tion ( R 2 = 0 . 92 ) between the normalized elastic modulus ( to controls ) of surviving cells and the percentage of living cells in that environment was noted , suggesting that ( a ) the health of organelles in a toxic environment strongly influ - ences cell mechanics , ( b ) cell biomechanics could also be correlated to biochemical outcomes , in addition to biophysi - cal changes , and ( c ) biomechanical characteristics ( modulus , tether forces , adhesion ) are key markers and predictors of neurotoxicity . In studies exploring role of silver nanopar - ticles on human embryonic kidney cells , a similar strong Archives of Toxicology 1 3 negative correlation between DNA damage and factor of viscosity was noted ( Jiang et al . 2018 ) . Multivariate logistic regression analysis ( Alexopoulos 2010 ; Kozel et al . 2014 ) suggested that elastic modulus ( p < 0 . 001 ) , adhesion force ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , and tether force ( p < 0 . 0001 ) were significant predictors of NPC toxicity . The receiver operating charac - teristic ( ROC ) was analyzed to gauge the utility of elastic modulus , adhesion force , and tether force as reliable indica - tors of NPC health , resulting in the model given by : M = 1 . 672 – 0 . 033 × E Y – 0 . 109 × F ad – 0 . 003 × F T , where E Y ( elastic modulus ) is in kPa , F ad ( adhesion force ) is in nN , and F T ( tether force ) is in pN units . Based on the Akaike infor - mation criterion ( AIC ) calculated from this model ( Wang 2013 ) , changes in tether force appears to be the strongest predictor of neurotoxicity . The time – concentration - dependent decrease in adhe - sion force upon toxicant exposure suggests an alteration of cell membrane , possibly the modification of surface adhe - sion molecules . The polysaccharides on cell surface and secreted ECM proteins are primarily responsible for cellu - lar adhesion . Typically , an increase in adhesion force sug - gests an aggregation of polysaccharides , while a decrease in adhesion force suggests denaturation or detachment of polysaccharides from cell surface . Cell adhesion molecules such as integrins , proteoglycans , selectins , cadherins , oli - gosaccharides , and immunoglobulins mediate cell – cell and cell – ECM interactions ( Müller and Dufrêne 2011 ) . Exposure to heavy metals ( e . g . , lead , methylmercury ) and organic sulfates led to altered expression and function of cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins and IgCAMs ( Grun - wald 2018 ) . Upon exposure of glyphosate ( a herbicide ) , a concentration - dependent reduction in cell adhesion was observed in MC3T3 - E1 cells , via blocking of RGD - specific integrin ( Szekacs et al . 2018 ) . Inhibiting fibronectin – integrin binding leads to a strong decrease in adhesion force of pri - mary gastrulating cells as detected by AFM analysis ( Puech et al . 2005 ) . Adhesion force is an encouraging biomarker for changes in cell surface due to inflammation or differentia - tion ( Pi et al . 2014 ; Xing et al . 2011 ) . Our observations on changes in adhesion forces of NPCs are in line with reports on human aortic endothelial cells exposed to diesel exhaust particles ( Wu et al . 2012 ) . Various techniques ( e . g . , micropipette aspiration , optical - tweezers , magnetic twisting cytometry , microfluidics , AFM ) have been developed to study cell biomechanics , to under - stand how cells perceive transformations and perturbation due to mechanical forces . For instance , optical tweezer anal - ysis of erythrocytes and leukemic cells exposed to doxoru - bicin showed a decrease in cell modulus , demonstrating the need for biomechanical assays to screen the toxic concentra - tion of drugs and prevent the risk of vascular complications due to high dosages ( Fraczkowska et al . 2018 ) . However , the unique capabilities of AFM such as non - invasive characteri - zation , measurements under physiological conditions , pre - cise control on the magnitude and frequency of the applied forces , and high spatial control , makes it the most suitable technique to image and mechanically characterize either fixed or live cells or tissues . From the retraction profile of force – indentation curve , we quantified the forces involved in individual and multiple membrane tethers on NPCs in the presence and absence of the compounds ( 50 – 400 pN ) . Our results are in the range of tether forces measured using techniques such as AFM or optical tweezers , for a variety of different cells and vesicles ( Pontes et al . 2011 ; Sun et al . 2005 ) . Toxicant - exposed NPCs showed higher values of tether radius as compared to control cells , indicating a weak connection between cytoskeleton and plasma membrane upon toxicant exposure . The aver - age apparent membrane tension decreased from 13 . 9 nN / µm in control cells to 0 . 5 nN / µm upon exposure to 0 . 56 µM digoxin . Such compromise in apparent membrane tension follows the similar patterns observed with cellular stiffness and cellular adhesion . However , changes in adhesive forces , tether forces , or membrane tension would have less effect on cell elastic modulus compared to alterations in actin cytoskeleton . Cell shape is maintained by the cortical tension , cell – matrix adhesion , cell – cell contact , and the microen - vironment . Various developmental stages require changes in cell shape which contribute to morphogenetic processes . CNS diseases ( e . g . , Parkinson’s , Alzheimer’s ) and disorders ( e . g . , neural tube defects ) have been shown to be associated with the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton ( May - Simera and Liu 2013 ) . Therefore , the significant time – concentration - dependent changes in NPC cytoskeleton upon toxicant expo - sure is of interest as it could lead to developmental defects in the short term ( changes in NPC migration , differentiation ) Fig . 6 Changes in elastic modulus of human NPCs were correlated to compromise in cell death calculated from most sensitive assay upon toxicants exposure . A strong negative correlation ( R 2 = 0 . 92 ) was noted suggesting that the biomechanical properties can be correlated to sub - cellular mechanism of cell death induced by toxicants . Here C refers to control cultures which did not receive any compounds Archives of Toxicology 1 3 and neurodegenerative diseases in the long term . Although genetic and epigenetic changes could be expected in NPCs exposed to toxicants , it was not the primary goal of this study and therefore will be investigated in future studies . In conclusion , we investigated and correlated the cyto - toxic , biophysical and biomechanical aspects of a variety of classes of compounds on human NPCs . We highlighted the role of cell biomechanics as a crucial marker and predictor of developmental neurotoxicity by demonstrating a compro - mise in cellular mechanics upon exposure to four different classes of toxicants . A negative linear correlation between the levels of cell death in vitro upon toxicant exposure and the intrinsic changes in cell elastic modulus was noted . We propose the term mechanotoxicology to ascribe cellular mechanics as an important toxicity endpoint and validated the utility of developmentally relevant human NPCs as an appropriate cell model for compound screening . We also elu - cidated the underlying mechanisms of cell death and dete - rioration of cell health associated with toxicant exposure . Our current studies are geared towards investigating genetic changes corresponding to perturbation of cellular mechan - ics , as well as investigating the effects of these compounds on NPCs differentiation .
