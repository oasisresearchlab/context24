Tilney , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , and approved April 3 , 2003 ( received for review January 28 , 2003 ) Extension of lamellipodia , an important dissipative process in cell motility , is driven by the turnover of a polarized dendritic array of actin ﬁlaments . Motility is driven by catalytic cycles of ﬁlament attachment to Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - activat - ed actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 (cid:1) 3 complex at the leading edge , branch formation , and detachment , allowing subsequent growth of branched ﬁlaments . The morphology , mechanical strength , and lifetime of the array are determined by the processes of ﬁlament branching , debranching , and treadmilling . All three processes are controlled by ATP hydrolysis . ATP hydrolysis on F - actin is known to be at the origin of treadmilling . Here , by using radiolabeled ATP covalently bound to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 , we show that ATP is hydrolyzed on Arp2 , not on Arp3 , after a delay following ﬁlament branching . Hydrolysis of ATP on Arp2 promotes debranching of ﬁlaments and acts as a clock that controls the stability of dendritic actin arrays in lamellipodia . Finally , we propose that hydrolysis of ATP on G - actin intheternaryG - actin – WASP – Arp2 (cid:1) 3complexonbranchformation destabilizes the WASP – actin interface and energetically facilitates the detachment step in the branching reaction . T he extension of cell protrusions , generated by site - directed polymerization of actin into cohesive 3D networks , is the first elementary process in cell migration ( 1 ) . The mechanical prop - erties of these extensions , lamellipodia and filopodia , are con - trolled by several signal - responsive proteins , including actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 (cid:1) 3 complex , which induces the formation of branched filaments ( 2 – 4 ) ; cortactin , which stabilizes the branches ( 5 ) ; and ABP 280 (cid:1) filamin A , which cross - links fila - ments orthogonally in gels ( 6 ) . Elucidating how the regulation of the structure , stability , and plasticity of the branched , cross - linked actin array is coupled to efficient locomotion is a crucial issue . The protrusive activity at the leading edge is mimicked by the propulsive movement of Listeria or Shigella pathogens ( 7 ) , endocytic vesicles ( 8 ) , or functionalized microspheres ( 4 , 9 ) , which has been analyzed in vitro in reconstituted motility assays . Recent data have indicated that Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , activated by Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) or by the Listeria protein ActA ( 10 – 14 ) , incorporates into filaments after barbed end branching ( 4 , 9 , 15 – 17 ) and appears located at the branch junction in lamellipodia ( 18 ) . In addition , the balance between filament branching and capping of barbed ends by capping proteins controls the branch spacing , which is one of the factors that determines the mechanical characteristics of the branched actin array ( 9 , 19 ) . Another important parameter is the rate of debranching . In vitro , branched filaments assembled in the presence of WASP and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex spontaneously de - branch after a delay of a few minutes after branching ( 2 , 15 , 16 , 20 ) . In motile structures like Listeria actin tails or lamellipodia , debranching of filaments is expected to create destabilization zones in the array and to generate filament pointed ends available for depolymerization . Therefore , the rate of debranch - ing is a potentially important kinetic parameter in the control of the mechanical strength , morphology , and lifetime of the den - dritic array in vivo . Yet the key elementary reactions that are involved and determine the recycling of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 are not known . Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex contains Arp2 and Arp3 ( 21 ) , which bind ATP . Binding of ATP to Arp2 is enhanced after activation of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 by WASP and is required for filament branching ( 22 ) . In contrast , binding of ATP to Arp3 is not affected by WASP . These results suggest ( 22 ) that ATP binding and hydrolysis on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 must play a pivotal role in Arp2 (cid:1) 3 function . This issue is addressed here . Methods Proteins . Actin was purified from rabbit muscle , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 from bovine brain , and other proteins used here as described ( 13 ) . Actin was fluorescently labeled on Cys - 374 by using pyrenyli - odoacetamide and on Lys - 373 by using 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazol - 4 - yl ( NBD ) - Cl . Photo - Cross - Linking of 8 - Azido - ATP to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 . ATP was covalently bound to either Arp3 alone or Arp2 and Arp3 as follows . Arp2 (cid:1) 3 ( 2 (cid:1) M ) in buffer A ( 5 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 7 . 5 (cid:1) 100 mM KCl (cid:1) 1 mM MgCl 2 (cid:1) 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) was incubated with 5 (cid:1) M 8 - azido - [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP ( ALT , Lexington , KY ) with or without 20 (cid:1) M WA , the C - terminal domain of N - WASP , and photoirradiated for 45 s . The reaction was stopped by 1 mM DTT . Autoradiography of the electrophoresed photoirradiated material showed that 18 % of Arp3 and 5 % of Arp2 had [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP covalently bound in the absence of WA , whereas 12 % Arp3 and 23 % Arp2 had [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP covalently bound in the presence of WA . The active covalent adduct was isolated as follows . Free 8 - azido - [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP was eliminated by treatment by hexokinase ( 10 units (cid:1) ml ) and 1 mM glucose . Covalent [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex was sepa - rated from free 8 - azido - ADP , glucose , and glucose 6 - [ 32 P ] phos - phate by gel filtration ( Sephadex G - 25 ) in buffer A (cid:1) 1 mM DTT . After the hexokinase (cid:1) gel filtration steps , Arp2 carried either exchangeable ADP or covalently bound [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP . Only the latter species was able to branch filaments . To evaluate the filament - branching activity of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 photo - cross - linked to ATP , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 photoirradiated in the presence of 8 - azido - ATP and WA and treated by hexokinase (cid:1) glucose was chromato - graphed on ATP - agarose to remove the fraction of unreacted Arp2 (cid:1) 3 that still possessed exchangeable ATP - binding sites . It was verified that the ATP - agarose - treated Arp2 (cid:1) 3 contained 2 mol of [ 32 P ] ATP per mol of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 and that the rates of branched actin polymerization were identical within 10 % in the absence or presence of added free ATP . The filament - branching activity of the photo - cross - linked azido - ATP - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex prepared as described previously was measured in a polymer - ization test by using 1 : 1 ATP – G - actin complex ( 5 (cid:1) M ) , 1 (cid:1) M WA , and comparison with standards of ATP - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 . Of the branching activity of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 , 75 % was recovered when 8 - azido - ATP had been photo - cross - linked to both Arp2 and Arp3 .

Cleavage of ATP ( acid - labile P i ) was monitored by extraction of 32 P - labeled phosphomolybdate ( 23 ) during poly - merization of 5 (cid:1) M ATP – G - actin 1 : 1 complex ( 4 % pyrenyl - labeled ) and 1 (cid:1) M WA with 100 nM Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex carrying covalently bound [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP on both Arp2 and Arp3 in buffer A containing 1 mM DTT , 50 (cid:1) M BeCl 2 , and 10 mM NaF to prevent actin depolymerization after exhaustion of ATP . The specific radioactivity of [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP - labeled Arp2 (cid:1) 3 was in the range 3 – 30 Ci (cid:1) mmol ( 1 Ci (cid:2) 37 GBq ) . The concentrations of actin and WA used were selected for producing the maximum number of branched filaments from 100 nM Arp2 (cid:1) 3 . The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 were unchanged when free ATP was present in the assay ( compare Fig . 1 B and C ) . For P i release measurement , samples were centrifuged at 300 , 000 (cid:3) g for 300 s at room temperature and the supernatant was submit - ted to 32 P i measurement as described in the previous section . When only Arp3 had been photo - cross - linked to azido - [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP ( in absence of WA ) , the hydrolysis of ATP on Arp3 during formation of branched filaments was monitored in the presence of free ATP so that unlabeled ATP was bound to Arp2 , allowing branching to occur . All experiments shown have been reproduced at least three times . Binding of CrATP to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 . The displacement of 1 , N 6 - etheno - ATP ( (cid:3) - ATP ) bound to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 by CrATP was performed in the presence or absence of WA , using the enhancement of fluores - cence of (cid:3) - ATP after binding Arp2 (cid:1) 3 as described ( 22 ) . CrATP was as efficient as MgATP in displacing (cid:3) - ATP from either Arp3 in the absence of WA or both Arp2 and Arp3 in the presence of WA . Dependence of Filament Branching on the Nucleotide Bound to Actin and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 . MgADP – G - actin was prepared by incubating MgATP – G - actin with hexokinase ( 10 units (cid:1) ml ) and 1 mM glucose , followed by Sephadex G - 25 filtration in 5 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) (cid:1) 100 (cid:1) M MgCl 2 (cid:1) 10 (cid:1) M ADP (cid:1) 0 . 2 mM DTT . CrATP - actin was prepared as described ( 23 ) by addition of 500 (cid:1) M CrATP to Mg [ 3 H ] ADP - actin ( prepared as described previously by using 3 H - labeled ATP ) . To assemble branched filaments from MgADP - actin or CrATP - actin and ATP - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 was photo - cross - linked to azido - ATP , gel - filtered , and treated by ATP - agarose as described in the previous section . A sedimentation assay of the polymerized actin was performed to check that CrATP had displaced 85 % of actin - bound [ 3 H ] ADP . To polymerize filaments with CrATP bound to actin and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 , CrATP was added to MgADP - actin and to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 preequilibrated with 10 (cid:1) M ADP . Kinetics of Debranching . Filament debranching was monitored by light microscopy as described ( 16 ) . Actin ( 5 (cid:1) M ) was rapidly polymerized in the presence of WA and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 , under indicated conditions of bound nucleotide , in 20 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ( which ensures stability of CrATP over the time course of the experiments ) . As soon as 90 % polymerization was reached , aliquots were removed from the solution at time intervals , supplemented with rhodamine - phalloidin , diluted 500 - fold , and processed for observation in an Olympus ( Melville , NY ) AX - 70 microscope with a (cid:3) 100 ( numerical aperture 1 : 35 ) objective and Fig . 1 .

Aliquots were removed at intervals to measure acid labile 32 P i ( ﬁlled red circles ) or centrifuged before 32 P i extrac - tion to measure released P i ( open red circles ) .

A control sample was tested ( green circles ) in which Arp2 (cid:1) 3 was prepared with WA and 8 - azido - [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP as above but not photoirradiated . No hydrolysis of azido - ATP was recorded , testifying that the measured hydrolysis in the curve with red circles occurs strictly on covalently cross - linked ATP - Arp2 and is not a parasite reac - tion occurring on actin . 6338 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 1130513100 Le Clainche et al . a Lhesa ( Cergy - Pontoise , France ) LH4046 video camera . The number of branches per micrometer of actin filaments was calculated by using METAMORPH software . At each time point , a total filament length of 5 , 000 – 30 , 000 (cid:1) m and about 500 branches at the earliest time were counted . Double - Label Seeded Growth Assay . Branched filaments were as - sembled from unlabeled G - actin ( 2 . 5 (cid:1) M ) , 0 . 5 (cid:1) M WA , and 50 nM Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ; let sit for 90 min until debranched ; and stabilized by addition of 2 . 5 (cid:1) M rhodamine - phalloidin . These filaments were used as seeds by 20 - fold dilution into a solution of 2 (cid:1) M G - actin for 1 – 2 min . After addition of 2 (cid:1) M Alexa 488 - labeled phalloidin , filaments were diluted 500 - fold and processed for rhodamine (cid:1) Alexa 488 fluorescence microscopy observation as described in the previous section . Results Monitoring ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex during poly - merization of actin into branched filaments is a challenging task because actin , which is at concentrations about three orders of magnitude higher than Arp2 (cid:1) 3 , hydrolyzes ATP after polymer - ization . The potential contribution of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 represents about 0 . 1 % of the overall hydrolysis of ATP during assembly of branched filaments . This difficulty was overcome by measuring hydrolysis of [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP covalently bound to Arp2 and (cid:1) or Arp3 exclusively while actin was polymerizing with bound unlabeled ATP . We have shown that the K d for binding ATP to Arp2 is 40 (cid:1) M in the absence of WA and 0 . 1 (cid:1) M in the presence of WA ( 22 ) . Hence , at low concentration of ATP ( (cid:4) 10 (cid:1) M ) , ATP binds and is photo - cross - linked to Arp3 only in the absence of WA and to both Arp2 and Arp3 in the presence of WA . The yield of photoincorporation of ATP was greatly enhanced when 8 - azido - [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP was used instead of ATP , whereas the effect of WA on the binding of ATP to Arp2 remained unaltered after replacing ATP by 8 - azido - ATP ( Fig . 1 A ) . The autocatalytic polymerization curves recorded with Arp2 (cid:1) 3 can be analyzed and modeled assuming that Arp2 (cid:1) 3 generates new filaments by barbed end branching exclusively and is not a conventional nucleating agent ( 15 ) . That the polymerization curves remained unchanged with photoirradiated covalent ATP - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 instead of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 that freely exchanges ATP demonstrates that the filament - branching activity of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 is unaltered by the cova - lent cross - linking of ATP ( Fig . 2 B ) . ATP - actin was assembled in branched filaments in the pres - ence of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex carrying photo - cross - linked [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP on both Arp2 and Arp3 ( see Methods ) . Polymerization was complete in 400 s , whereas ATP was hydrolyzed on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex in an exponential process strongly uncoupled from the branching reaction , with a rate constant of ( 8 (cid:5) 1 ) (cid:1) 10 (cid:6) 4 s (cid:6) 1 ( half - time of 800 (cid:5) 100 s ; Fig . 1 B ) . A plateau was reached at which 4 . 8 nM ATP had been hydrolyzed . Kinetic analysis of the polymerization curve ( 15 ) showed that up to 4 . 5 nM filaments Fig . 2 . ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 is required for actin ﬁlament debranching . ( A ) ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 is not a consequence of debranching . ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 was monitored during polymerization as in Fig . 1 , in the absence of phalloidin ( ﬁlled green circles ) or after addition of 10 (cid:1) M phalloidin ( red circles ) at the end of the polymerization at 200 s ( arrow ) . Filled red circles , cleavage of ATP ; open red circles , P i release in the presence of phalloidin . Actin assembly in the presence or in the absence of phalloidin was recorded simultaneously ( blue line ) . ( B ) Filament branching does not depend on the actin - bound nucleotide . The assembly reaction contained 5 (cid:1) M actin ( continuous lines ) or 7 . 5 (cid:1) M actin ( dashed lines ) , 1 (cid:1) M WA , 100 nM Arp2 (cid:1) 3 at pH 7 . 0 , and the indicated combinations ofnucleotideboundtoArp2 (cid:1) 3andactin .

( C ) P i release from Arp2 is required for ﬁlament debranching . ( Upper ) Filaments branched with the indicated combinations of nucleotides were stabilized at 180 and 3 , 500 s by rhodamine - phalloidin . ( Lower ) The time course of ﬁlament debranching was monitored after polymerization was performed by using the same conditions and combinations of bound nucleotides as in B . Each experiment was repeated at least three times . Le Clainche et al . PNAS (cid:2) May 27 , 2003 (cid:2) vol . 100 (cid:2) no . 11 (cid:2) 6339 B I O C H E M I S T R Y were created by branching . Hence , one molecule of ATP was hydrolyzed on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex after formation of a branch . The time courses of release of P i and cleavage of ATP superimposed , indicating that P i release is faster than chemical cleavage of ATP on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 . When branched filaments were assembled with Arp2 (cid:1) 3 com - plex carrying photo - cross - linked [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP on Arp3 only , while ATP was noncovalently bound to Arp2 , no hydrolysis of radio - actively labeled ATP was detected even 2 h after formation of branched filaments ( Fig . 1 C ) . In the parallel sample containing photo - cross - linked [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP on both Arp2 and Arp3 and branching at the same rate , ATP was hydrolyzed after branch formation . Altogether , these results demonstrate that ATP is hydrolyzed on Arp2 , not on Arp3 , with a delay of several minutes after filament branching . Strikingly , ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex kinetically correlated with filament debranching , which occurred with the same half - time of 800 (cid:5) 100 s when filaments were branched with either covalently or noncovalently bound ATP ( Fig . 2 C ) . To determine whether ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 is the cause or the consequence of the dissociation of the daughter filament from the mother filament , phalloidin was added at the end of the polymerization process to slow down debranching ( 2 ) . The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and P i release on Arp2 were not affected by phalloidin , indicating that ATP hydrolysis is not consecutive to and likely precedes debranching ( Fig . 2 A ) . Cor - tactin , which synergizes with WA to activate Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( 5 ) , also slowed down debranching but , like phalloidin , did not affect ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 ( data not shown ) . To examine whether the nature of the nucleotide bound to actin affected branching or debranching , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 - stimulated polymerization of actin in branched filaments was carried out by using different combinations of nucleotides bound to actin (cid:1) Arp2 (cid:1) 3 , respectively , as follows : MgATP (cid:1) MgATP , MgADP (cid:1) MgATP , CrATP (cid:1) MgATP , and CrATP (cid:1) CrATP . CrATP is a metal ion exchange - inert analog of MgATP in which the stability of the bonds between the Cr ( III ) ion and the (cid:4) - and (cid:2) - phos - phates of ATP prevents the release of the cleaved (cid:2) - phosphate of ATP on F - actin ( 23 ) . Branching of filaments occurred irre - spective of the actin - bound nucleotide ( Fig . 2 B ) , in full agree - ment with a recent report ( 17 ) . The rate of debranching was the same whether ATP was covalently or noncovalently bound to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 and was not affected by the nucleotide bound to actin . Specifically , branched filaments assembled from either MgATP - actin or CrATP - actin using MgATP - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 debranched at the same rate , but filaments branched with CrATP - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 debranched 12 - fold more slowly ( Fig . 2 C ) , indicating that if P i is not released from Arp2 , the daughter filament does not dissociate from the mother filament . Altogether , these results demonstrate that ATP hydrolysis (cid:1) P i release on Arp2 at the branch drives dissociation of the daughter filament but they do not support the expressed view ( 20 ) that ATP hydrolysis and P i release from F - actin , which occurs 10 - fold faster ( k (cid:2) 6 (cid:1) 10 (cid:6) 3 s (cid:6) 1 ; ref . 24 ) , cause filament debranching . That branched fila - ments made from ADP - actin and ATP - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 branch as well as those assembled from ATP - actin does not support the proposal that Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex branches filaments by preferential side - binding to the terminal ADP – P i – F - actin subunits , rather than by binding to the barbed ends ( 25 , 26 ) . In the present solution studies , the time at which WA puta - tively dissociates from the branch is not known , whereas in vivo , dissociation of the branch from membrane - bound WASP pre - cedes filament growth . To examine whether dissociation of the activator affects ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 or debranching of filaments , assembly of branched filaments was performed under conditions mimicking the in vivo context , using N - WASP , the neural homolog of WASP , immobilized at the surface of poly - styrene beads ( 9 ) . Beads generated autocatalytic polymerization curves identical to the ones observed with soluble WA . As reported ( 9 , 27 ) , branched filaments released from bead - immobilized N - WASP were observed in the light microscope . Hydrolysis of [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP covalently cross - linked to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex followed the same slow kinetics as when Arp2 (cid:1) 3 was activated by soluble WA ( data not shown ) . Hence , ATP hydro - lysis on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 at the branch and debranching are not rate - limited by the dissociation of WA but may occur at a later stage after the faster dissociation of WA . The above results then raise the issue of the nature of the elementary process that causes dissociation of the filament from surface - bound activator after branch formation , thus enabling growth of the mother and daughter filaments . Filament branch - ing involves the association of the ternary G - actin – WA – Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex with a barbed end . The G - actin – WA moiety of the ternary complex , like profilin – actin , associates productively with the barbed end and participates in barbed end growth ( 13 ) . Accordingly , the covalently cross - linked WA - actin complex co - polymerizes with actin ( M . - F . C . , unpublished results ) . We pro - posed ( 4 , 15 ) that the association of the G - actin – WA moiety of the ternary complex with the barbed end of the mother filament would initiate the formation of a branch . Within this hypothesis , ATP hydrolysis on WA - bound G - actin , after barbed end asso - ciation , should destabilize the interaction between the two proteins and facilitate the detachment of the product of the branching reaction . This hypothesis was tested by monitoring the binding of WA to MgATP – G - actin and MgADP – G - actin com - paratively by using the quenching of fluorescence of NBD - G - actin linked to WA binding as a probe . Fig . 3 shows that , like profilin ( 28 ) , WA binds MgADP – G - actin with a 7 - fold - lower affinity than MgATP – G - actin , in support of the described hypothesis . Visualization and quantitation of rhodamine - actin and Alexa 488 - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex in actin tails by using fluorescence micros - copy have revealed that as the fluorescence intensities of actin Fig . 3 . ATP hydrolysis destabilizes the interaction between WA and G - actin . Fluorescence of NBD - labeled MgATP – G - actin ( red circles ) or MgADP – G - actin ( blue circles ) in low ionic strength buffer was quenched by addition of WA as indicated . The changes in ﬂuorescence ( (cid:5) ex (cid:2) 475 nm , (cid:5) em (cid:2) 530 nm ) are normalized and expressed in terms of concentration of WA – actin complex . Dashed lines represent the stoichiometric titration curve ( inﬁnite afﬁnity ) . Solid curves are calculated with values of K d of 0 . 1 and 0 . 7 (cid:1) M for the ATP - bound and ADP - bound forms of WA – actin complex , respectively .

This result indicates that Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is lost at the same rate as actin by depolymerization . Because ADP - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 is unable to branch filaments ( 22 , 29 ) , ATP exchange for bound ADP has to occur to recycle Arp2 (cid:1) 3 subsequent to ATP hydrolysis . To determine whether a second branching reaction can take place from mother filament - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 after dissociation of the daughter branch and exchange of ATP for bound ADP , branched filaments were left aside until debranched , stained with rhodamine - phalloidin , and used as seeds by diluting them in a solution containing G - actin . Filament stretches formed in 2 min were stained with Alexa 488 - labeled phalloidin . Alexa 488 - labeled stretches grew endwise only from rhodamine - labeled seeds . No side growth of filaments from ‘‘old’’ Arp2 (cid:1) 3 branching sites was observed , indicating that Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex branches only once in the polymerization process ( data not shown ) . In conclusion , recycling of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is linked to filament depolymerization . Nucleotide exchange on Arp2 is rapid and probably is not rate - limiting in the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 ATPase cycle in vitro ( rate constant on the order of 1 s (cid:6) 1 ; ref . 29 ) but it might be affected by regulators in vivo . Discussion We have shown that ATP hydrolysis regulates Arp2 (cid:1) 3 function . Although no hydrolysis of ATP can be detected on isolated or on activated Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( 22 , 29 ) , Arp2 is committed to hydrolyze ATP after filament branching . In contrast , no hydro - lysis of ATP occurs on Arp3 . A comprehensive scheme ( Fig . 4 ) featuring consecutive elementary steps in Arp2 (cid:1) 3 - induced fila - ment branching summarizes the results and emphasizes the kinship among actin , tubulin , small G proteins , and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex regarding the role of nucleotide exchange and hydro - lysis in biological activity . Like actin , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex hydrolyzes a bound nucleotide once committed in a macromolecular as - sembly . As on actin , ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 is not required for the building of this assembly but it promotes the destabilization of protein – protein interactions and leads to disassembly of the scaffold . However , differences exist among actin , Arp2 , and Arp3 despite the quasi - identity of residues in the ATP - binding sites of the three proteins ( 21 ) . ATP is not hydrolyzed on Arp3 after branching and ATP is hydrolyzed more slowly on Arp2 than on Mg - F - actin . These differences may be related to differences in the protein – protein contacts that trigger hydrolysis of ATP on actin in the filament and on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 at the branch . The nature of the partner protein that dissociates from Arp2 in the de - branching process is not known . Because the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex has seven subunits , several scenarios are possible . One possibil - ity , consistent with similarities between Arp2 and actin , is that when ATP is hydrolyzed on Arp2 , an Arp2 – actin bond in the branch , homolog of the ATP - sensitive actin – actin interface in the filament , is weakened . Phalloidin then might slow down debranching by stabilizing this actin – Arp2 bond . Overall , our results and conclusions regarding the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex differ from the views expressed by others ( 20 , 29 ) . First , ATP hydrolysis on F - actin was thought to cause debranching ( 20 ) , because phalloidin , which slows down P i release from F - actin , slows down debranching . However , those experiments had been done with rhodamine - phalloidin , which actually accelerates P i release ( 30 ) , hence the release of P i from F - actin could not be responsible for debranch - ing . The present results in addition show that debranching is not slowed down when CrADP - P i is bound to F - actin . Second , the finding that adenosine 5 (cid:7) - [ (cid:4) , (cid:2) - imido ] triphosphate ( AMPPNP ) - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 did not branch filaments suggested that ATP hydrolysis was required at some step of the branching process ( 29 ) or that , consistent with the low affinity of AMPPNP for Arp2 , AMP - PNP - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 did not have the active structure of ATP - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 ( 22 ) . The present results show that ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 is Fig . 4 . Modelforthecontrolofactinﬁlamentbranching – debranchingandturnoverbyATPbindingandhydrolysisonactinandArp2 (cid:1) 3complex . Thefollowing elementary steps are involved in ﬁlament branching and debranching . Step 1 , activation of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex by formation of the ternary complex G - actin – WA – Arp2 (cid:1) 3 . Step 2 , association of a ﬁlament to the immobilized activated complex . Step 3 , ATP hydrolysis on actin after incorporation at the branch destabilizes its interaction with WA , leading to detachment of the branched ﬁlament . Step 4 , growth of the mother and daughter branches . Step 5 , ATP hydrolysis on Arp2 at the branch causes debranching . Step 6 , depolymerization of ﬁlaments . Step 7 , nucleotide exchange on G - actin and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 allows recycling of active actin and Arp2 (cid:1) 3 . Le Clainche et al .

The fate of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex after debranching is an open issue . That in a motility assay the actin : Arp2 (cid:1) 3 ratio remains constant along the actin tail of propelling microspheres ( 9 ) indicates that Arp2 (cid:1) 3 is not released from the branch junction after debranching but remains bound to either the mother or the daughter filament . It is known ( 15 ) that Arp2 (cid:1) 3 does not cap the pointed end , which supports the view ( illustrated in Fig . 4 ) that it remains bound to the mother filament after debranching . It is remarkable that , in addition to ATP hydrolysis - driven treadmilling , two other dissipative reactions accompany the formation of branched actin arrays and regulate their stability and mechanical strength as well as motile behavior . The first dissipative reaction is associated with the cycle of filament attachment – branching – detachment ( 9 , 31 , 32 ) . After associa - tion of the mother filament with surface - immobilized G - actin – WASP – Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , ATP hydrolysis ( P i release ) occurs on the actin subunit that is incorporated in the branched structure ( 33 ) . We have shown here that hydrolysis of ATP greatly weakens the interaction of actin with the C - terminal domain of N - WASP . We propose that ATP hydrolysis on this actin subunit is likely to contribute in the detachment of the product of the branching reaction from immobilized N - WASP . The second ATP hydrolysis event occurs on Arp2 incorporated in the branch and destabilizes the interaction of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 with the daughter branch , causing debranching . Hydrolysis of ATP on Arp2 is slow ( rate constant 8 (cid:1) 10 (cid:6) 4 s (cid:6) 1 ) , imposing a delay between the time courses of formation of a branched filament array and of its disappearance by debranching . In conclusion , as illustrated in Fig . 4 , ATP hydrolysis acts as a double clock controlling the proportion of attached and detached filaments during stationary movement on the one hand and the lifetime and morphology of branched filament arrays on the other hand . In vitro , the half - time of debranching is 10 min . Assuming that filaments debranch at the same rate in vivo , in a cell crawling at 1 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min , 26 % of the filaments must have debranched at a distance of 3 (cid:1) m from the leading edge , thus bringing an appreciable destabilization of the actin array at the rear of the lamellipodium . It is also possible that some cellular factors accelerate debranching in vivo . Potential regulation of ATP hydrolysis on the actin protomer incorporated at the branch and on Arp2 is expected to have a bearing on the protrusive force (cid:1) velocity and stability of branched actin arrays . How these reactions further combine with the activities of other proteins such as fimbrin , filamin , and cortactin that control the overall architecture of the actin array is an open issue .
