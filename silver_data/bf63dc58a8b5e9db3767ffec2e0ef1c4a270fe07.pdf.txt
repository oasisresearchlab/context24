Shad Thaxton 1 , 2 , 6 Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles that mediate intercellular communication . Cellular exosome uptake mechanisms are not well defined partly due to the lack of specific inhibitors of this complex cellular process . Exosome uptake depends on cholesterol - rich membrane microdomains called lipid rafts , and can be blocked by non - specific depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol . Scavenger receptor type B - 1 ( SR - B1 ) , found in lipid rafts , is a receptor for cholesterol - rich high - density lipoproteins ( HDL ) . We hypothesized that a synthetic nanoparticle mimic of HDL ( HDL NP ) that binds SR - B1 and removes cholesterol through this receptor would inhibit cellular exosome uptake . In cell models , our data show that HDL NPs bind SR - B1 , activate cholesterol efflux , and attenuate the influx of esterified cholesterol . As a result , HDL NP treatment results in decreased dynamics and clustering of SR - B1 contained in lipid rafts and potently inhibits cellular exosome uptake . Thus , SR - B1 and targeted HDL NPs provide a fundamental advance in studying cholesterol - dependent cellular uptake mechanisms . Exosomes transport molecular cargo to and from cells as a means of intercellular communication 1 , 2 , and play a fundamental role in biology 3 . For example , exosomes isolated from stem cells have been shown to increase tissue regeneration after injury 4 , 5 . Additionally , exosomes play an important role in the immune system , through the delivery of major histocompatibility complexes ( MHCs ) 6 , 7 . Exosomes also contribute to many diseases 1 , 8 , 9 , including cancer 10 , 11 . Cancer cells enhance their production of exosomes as a means of facilitating disease progression 12 , 13 . For example , exosomes produced by melanoma cells have been shown to target endothelial cells to enhance angiogenesis 14 , as well as macrophages and den - dritic cells causing immune suppression 15 . In addition , considerable data are accumulating showing that enhanced exosome production by cancer cells facilitates metastasis by conditioning the pre - metastatic niche through the mobilization of bone marrow cells 16 and the delivery of pro - tumorigenic cargo to metastatic sites 11 . Specific receptors on target cells that exosomes utilize for uptake are not well known 17 . Data show that target cells uptake exosomes by directly fusing with the plasma membrane 18 , as well as via receptor mediated endocytosis 19 . Because exosome - cell interactions are believed to be critical events to informa - tion transfer between the exosome and the target cell , further understanding fundamental mechanisms 1 Northwestern University , Feinberg School of Medicine , Department of Urology , Tarry 16 - 703 , 303 E .

Key to this effort is the identification of specifically targeted agents that potently inhibit cellular exosome uptake 19 . Recent data show that exosome uptake by target cells is dependent upon the integrity of plasma membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts , which are known to be rich in cholesterol 20 . Non - specific depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol alters lipid raft integrity and inhibits cellular exosome uptake 21 . Scavenger receptor type B - 1 ( SR - B1 ) is a high - affinity receptor for mature high - density lipopro - teins ( HDL ) that are rich in cholesterol and cholesteryl ester . Upon binding SR - B1 , HDL mediates the bi - directional flux of free cholesterol between the HDL particle and the plasma membrane , and serves as a source of cholesteryl ester 22 , 23 . Scavenger receptor type B - 1 resides in plasma membrane lipid rafts 24 where it maintains cholesterol balance and enables the uptake of extracellular material and cell signa - ling 25 . Our group developed a synthetic , functional HDL - like nanoparticle ( HDL NP ) 26 – 28 that binds SR - B1 26 , 29 . HDL NPs are synthesized using a gold nanoparticle ( AuNP ) as a core template , and then decorated with the surface molecules , phospholipids and apolipoprotein A - I ( apo AI ) , consistent with the surface chemistry of natural , mature spherical HDLs 26 . HDL NPs are highly functional with regard to their ability to bind SR - B1 and efflux free cholesterol 26 . Because of the core AuNP , HDL NPs are inherently devoid of cholesteryl ester . As such , HDL NPs bind SR - B1 and differentially modulate cellular cholesterol homeostasis relative to their cholesterol - rich natural HDL counterparts 26 , 29 . Due to the localization of SR - B1 to lipid rafts and the dependence of exosome uptake on cholesterol balance in the plasma membrane , we hypothesized that specific targeting of SR - B1 with cholesterol bind - ing HDL NPs 26 – 29 would disrupt cellular exosome uptake . As a model , we explored exosomes derived from cultured melanoma cells due to the established importance of the uptake of these exosomes by melanoma and other target cells 11 , 15 , 30 , 31 , and because melanoma exosomes have been shown to promote disease progression whereby targeted inhibitors of this process may be translationally relevant 30 , 32 . Results Exosome Isolation and Characterization . To isolate melanoma - derived exosomes , A375 melanoma cells were cultured and exosomes released into the media were isolated using differential ultracentrif - ugation 33 . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) measurements indicated vesicular structures of the expected morphology and size ( 30 – 100 nm ) for exosomes , respec - tively ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . Western blot was used to determine the presence of exosome - specific protein cargo further confirming the identity of isolated structures as exosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Interestingly , we found that A375 cells express SR - B1 and exosomes from this cell line are also enriched for the receptor ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . These results demonstrate the successful isolation of melano - ma - derived exosomes for experiments . HDL NPs modulate cholesterol flux in melanoma cells . High - density lipoproteins are dynamic natural nanostructures that function to sequester , transport , and deliver cholesterol 34 . Many of the phys - ical properties and functions of natural HDLs can be mimicked by HDL NPs 26 , which are synthesized using a 5 nm diameter core AuNP template . The template controls final conjugate size and shape and provides a surface for the assembly of apo AI and phospholipids 28 . Comparison of HDL NPs to certain spherical human HDL ( hHDL ) species reveals similarities with regard to size , shape , surface chemistry , and negative surface charge 26 , 27 , 35 . Functionally , hHDLs bind SR - B1 and mediate the bi - directional flux of free cholesterol between the particle and the plasma membrane and transfer esterified cholesterol , found in the particle core , to the recipient cell 25 . HDL NPs have been shown to mediate bi - directional free cholesterol flux through SR - B1 , like hHDL 27 , 28 ; however , the AuNP core of HDL NPs occupies the same physical space as esterified cholesterol does in spherical hHDL rendering HDL NPs incapable of delivering to cells a similar payload of cholesteryl ester 26 , 29 . To clearly demonstrate this , we meas - ured free and esterified cholesterol contained in hHDL and HDL NPs . Data reveal a lack of both free and esterified cholesterol in freshly synthesized HDL NPs ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , as expected . hHDLs were found to have ~ 19 % free and ~ 81 % esterified cholesterol ( percent of total measured cholesterol ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Based on these results , we predicted that hHDLs and HDL NPs would exhibit differential effects on cholesterol flux in the A375 melanoma cells . To test this , we labeled the cellular cholesterol pool in melanoma cells using 3 H - cholesterol , and then performed cholesterol efflux assays to measure the removal of 3 H - cholesterol from these cells . Data show that HDL NPs induce cholesterol efflux at higher levels than hHDLs ( Fig . 1a ) . Treatment of cells with Blocks Lipid Transport 1 ( BLT - 1 ) , an inhibitor of SR - B1 - mediated cholesterol flux 36 , resulted in reduced efflux to both hHDLs and HDL NPs ( Fig . 1a ) suggesting that cholesterol efflux is , at least in part , mediated by specific targeting of the SR - B1 receptor by hHDLs and HDL NPs . After the efflux assay , hHDLs and HDL NPs were measured to have increased free cholesterol ( percent of total measured cholesterol ) ; however , there still was no measurable esterified cholesterol in HDL NPs versus hHDLs ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Cell viability assays demon - strate that despite the increased cholesterol efflux induced by HDL NPs , treatment with HDL NPs at 50 and 100 nm doses does not result in reduced A375 cell viability ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) at time points up to 72 hours . Thus , cholesterol and cholesteryl ester - poor HDL NPs are not inherently toxic to A375 melanoma cells , target SR - B1 , and differentially modulate cholesterol flux through this receptor . These www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 15724 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep15724 functionally distinct properties of HDL NPs prompted us to probe biological processes , like exosome uptake , that are dependent upon cholesterol . HDL NPs localize to scavenger receptor type - B1 , which resides in lipid rafts . The mechanistic link between lipid raft integrity and the role that these cell membrane microdomains play in exosome uptake 21 led us to test whether SR - B1 and HDL NPs localize to lipid rafts in melanoma cells . Consistent with published results 24 , analysis of lipid raft associated proteins via western blot confirmed that SR - B1 localizes to lipid rafts in A375 melanoma cells and showed that SR - B1 is enriched in the insoluble lipid Figure 1 . HDL NPs efflux cholesterol and specifically target SR - B1 in melanoma cells .

In complementary experiments , confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize lipid rafts in A375 melanoma cells by labeling the rafts with cholera toxin subunit b ( CTx - B ) conjugated to Alexafluor - 647 . We visualized SR - B1 by stably expressing a green fluorescent protein - SR - B1 ( GFP - SR - B1 ) fusion protein in the A375 cells 37 . Expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by western blotting ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Imaging revealed co - localization of GFP - SR - B1 with lipid rafts ( Fig . 1c ) . These data establish that lipid rafts in our model melanoma cell line are enriched in SR - B1 . To determine whether HDL NPs are targeted to lipid rafts and SR - B1 , we treated cells with HDL NPs labeled with a lipophilic fluorescent dye , 1 , 1 ′ - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 ′ , 3 ′ - tetramethylindodicarbocyanine , 4 - chlorobenzenesulfonate salt ( DiD ) , and imaged cells to determine co - localization with lipid rafts and SR - B1 . Imaging revealed that labeled HDL NPs ( red ) co - localize with lipid raft CTx - B , labeled with Alexa Fluor - 488 ( Fig . 1d ) , and with GFP - SR - B1 ( Fig . 1e ) . HDL NPs induce clustering and reduced mobility of SR - B1 . During the co - localization experi - ments , we imaged cells treated with HDL NPs at different time points . Intriguingly , images collected at 24 hours revealed physical clustering of GFP - SR - B1 ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) in a dose dependent manner and time - lapse microscopy revealed an apparent reduction in movement and displacement of the receptor upon the addition of HDL NPs ( Supplementary videos 2 and 4 ) as compared to untreated ( Supplementary videos 1 and 3 ) . To quantify these observations , we used automated image analysis ( Materials and Methods ) 38 , 39 . Data confirm an increase in the size and intensity of GFP - SR - B1 clusters , and a reduction in the number of labeled areas per cell after HDL NP treatment ( Fig . 2a – d ) . Also , we observed that GFP - SR - B1 clusters tended to remain at the cell membrane versus GFP - SR - B1 that was not clustered ( Supplementary Video 1 – 4 ) . This prompted us to perform tracking analysis to measure GFP - SR - B1 displacement ( Fig . 3a ) . Data revealed a significant quantitative reduction in the velocity ( Fig . 3b ) and in the ratio of the final displacement relative to the total displacement length ( rho ) of GFP - SR - B1 clusters ( Fig . 3c ) . Collectively , these data suggest that that HDL NPs bind SR - B1 in lipid rafts leading to clustering and arrested movement of GFP - SR - B1 . HDL NPs inhibit the cellular uptake of melanoma cell - derived exosomes . Cellular uptake of exosomes is dependent on lipid raft - mediated endocytosis 21 . As HDL NPs differentially modulate cellular cholesterol homeostasis and physically modulate SR - B1 localized to lipid rafts , we tested the hypothesis that HDL NPs interfere with cellular exosome uptake . Toward this end , we isolated exosomes from A375 mel - anoma cells and fluorescently labeled them with 1 , 1 ′ - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 ′ , 3 ′ - tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ( DiI ) . We then treated the A375 cells with labeled exosomes in the presence or absence of HDL NPs and subsequently measured cell uptake . Confocal fluorescent microscopy revealed that HDL NP treatment decreased exosome uptake as compared to untreated control cells at 24 hours ( Fig . 4a ) . In order to quantify exosome uptake in large numbers of cells we employed flow cytometry . Data demonstrated a dose - dependent decrease in exosome uptake after HDL NP treatment ( Fig . 4b ) . At the 50 nm dose , approximately 75 % of exosome uptake by the A375 cells was blocked . Notably , the uptake of exosomes was similar in wild - type and GFP - SR - B1 expressing A375 cells , and similar reductions in exosome uptake after HDL NP treatment were observed in both lines ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) . As a control , we treated GFP - SR - B1 expressing A375 cells with exosomes to determine if GFP - SR - B1 clustering was observed . Data reveal that exosome treatment alone did not result in the clustering of GFP - SR - B1 ( Supplementary Video 5 ) suggesting that this cellular phenotype resulted from HDL NP treatment . Additionally , to test if HDL NPs interact with exosome or A375 cell - associated SR - B1 , cells were pre - treated with HDL NPs for 12 hours , washed free of unbound HDL NP , and then treated with DiI labeled exosomes . Reduced exosome uptake following HDL NP pre - treatment suggests that decreased uptake is not due to extracel - lular interaction of exosomes and HDL NPs ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . In our cholesterol flux experiments ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , HDL NP and hHDL both bind to SR - B1 , promoting cholesterol efflux through this receptor . To determine whether hHDL had the same effect as HDL NP on inhibiting the cellular uptake of labeled exosomes , we again used flow cytometry . Intriguingly , data show that hHDL treatment only minimally inhibits cellular exosome uptake ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) compared to HDL NP treatment . Both hHDL and HDL NPs target SR - B1 , but only the HDL NPs inhibit exosome uptake , which provided an opportunity to demonstrate that hHDL and HDL NPs compete for the same cell surface receptors involved in exosome uptake . Co - treatment of cells with HDL NP and increasing amounts of hHDL resulted in a partial concentration - dependent recovery in exosome uptake ( Fig . 4c ) suggesting competition for SR - B1 . Based on our observing only a partial recovery , we reasoned that hHDL might also reduce cellular exosome uptake . To test this , A375 cells were co - treated with fluorescently labeled exosomes and hHDL at 5 , 50 or 500 nm concentra - tions and exosome uptake was measured using flow cytometry . hHDL was unable to potently block the uptake of exosomes even at a concentration of 500 nm , which is 10 - times the HDL NP concentration required for near complete inhibition of exosome uptake ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Accordingly , hHDL does not reduce cellular exosome uptake and the high concentration of hHDL needed to abrogate HDL NP - mediated inhibition of exosome uptake suggests that HDL NPs have a higher binding affinity to cell - surface SR - B1 receptors . Also , the ability of HDL NP to inhibit exosome uptake in comparison to hHDL suggests that binding SR - B1 and differential modulation of cholesterol are mechanistically impor - tant in inhibiting exosome uptake . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 5 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 15724 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep15724 To more directly test if the HDL NPs specifically target SR - B1 to inhibit exosome uptake , we treated cells with HDL NPs and a blocking antibody ( Ab ) to SR - B1 , which has been shown to inhibit hHDL binding to this receptor 40 . Treatment of A375 cells with the blocking Ab resulted in a significant reduction Figure 2 . HDL NPs induce clustering of scavenger receptor .

Thus , these data support the conclusion that HDL NPs specifically block exosome uptake in melanoma cells by binding SR - B1 . Targeting SR - B1 to block cellular exosome uptake . The pronounced effects of HDL NPs on both SR - B1 dynamics and exosome uptake led us to examine the functional importance of individual features specific to the HDL NPs . Structurally , HDL NPs comprise a 5 nm diameter gold core and have the size , shape , and surface chemistry consistent with some hHDL species 27 , but the inherent flexibility of NP synthesis techniques enabled generation of particles with different surface chemistry . This allowed us to measure exosome uptake and SR - B1 clustering after treating A375 cells with particles having an identical gold core , but with passive surface chemistry ( polyethylene glycol nanoparticles , PEG NPs ) . In addition , we also probed individual , functional properties of the HDL NPs by testing if the blocking Ab targeting SR - B1 40 ; the small molecule inhibitor of free and esterified cholesterol flux through SR - B1 , BLT - 1 36 ; siRNA targeting melanoma cell SR - B1 expression ; or combining HDL NPs and hHDL with BLT - 1 would modulate cellular exosome uptake . As measured using flow cytometry , HDL NPs were the only particle or SR - B1 targeted treatment capable of clustering GFP - SR - B1 and inducing potent inhibition of cellular exosome uptake ( Fig . 5a - l ) . These results suggest that HDL NPs occupy SR - B1 and modulate free and esterified cholesterol flux , and that this combination of events results in the clustering of SR - B1 and the disruption of cellular exosome uptake . Finally , our data suggest that cellular exosome uptake is , at least in part , not responsive to a reduction in cellular SR - B1 expression ( Fig . 5i , j ) ; however , specific binding of this receptor by HDL NPs is a potent , targeted mechanism to inhibit cellular exosome uptake . To more conclusively support the mechanism of action of the HDL NPs , we co - treated A375 mel - anoma cells with HDL NPs or hHDL and BLT - 1 to simultaneously occupy SR - B1 and block free and esterified cholesterol flux through the receptor , respectively . Intriguingly , data show that combining either hHDL or HDL NPs with BLT - 1 potently inhibits exosome uptake ( Fig . 5n , p ) . However , while some clustering of SR - B1 is observed , data show that there is less than when HDL NPs are used as a single agent ( Fig . 5m , o , q ) Therefore , as the only functional difference between treating cells with HDL NP alone versus in combination with BLT - 1 is the particle’s ability to support free cholesterol flux , this function Figure 3 . HDL NPs lead to reduced mobility and dispersion of SR - B1 containing domains . Time - lapse confocal imaging ( 2s intervals ) was used to visualize the dynamics of SR - B1 containing domains .

On the other hand , because exosome uptake is potently inhibited after combining HDL NP and hHDL with BLT - 1 , and since there is only a very slight increase in exosome uptake in the HDL NP + BLT - 1 case , data support that the inhibition of exosome uptake can be attributed to SR - B1 binding and inhibition of cholesteryl ester influx . Exosome uptake is not inhibited by HDL NPs after SR - B1 knockdown in A375 cells . In order to further show that HDL NPs directly target SR - B1 to inhibit exosome uptake , we reduced SR - B1 expression with SR - B1 targeted siRNA , as in the preceding section , but then treated the cells with labe - led exosomes and HDL NPs . Flow cytometry data convincingly show that after SR - B1 knockdown in wild - type A375 cells , confirmed by Western blot ( Fig . 6a ) , exosome uptake is not significantly reduced in the presence of HDL NP treatment ( Fig . 6b ) . Control experiments in wild - type A375 cells treated with scrambled siRNA ( Fig . 6b , showing no SR - B1 KD ) reveal that HDL NP treatment significantly reduces exosome uptake , as expected . These experiments further and directly implicate HDL NP targeting of SR - B1 as a mechanism to potently reduce cellular exosome uptake . The uptake of exosomes by endothelial cells and macrophages is also blocked by HDL NPs . Data collected using melanoma cells are intriguing , but we were curious if inhibition of exosome uptake by HDL NPs was unique to the A375 melanoma cells or was more general . As mentioned , mel - anoma exosomes are known to target endothelial cells and macrophages leading to activation of an angiogenic response 31 , and modulation of the immune system 13 . Therefore , we chose two different cell types , an endothelial cell line , human dermal microvascular endothelial cells ( HMVECs ) and RAW 264 . 7 macrophages and repeated select experiments to determine SR - B1 expression and HDL NP effect on exosome uptake . Like A375 cells , HMVECs express SR - B1 ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) and when treated with DiI labeled A375 exosomes in the presence of HDL NPs , these cells exhibited a decrease in cellu - lar fluorescence suggesting that exosome uptake is , indeed , blocked by HDL NP . In contrast , treatment with hHDL had minimal effect on exosome uptake ( Fig . 7a ) . RAW 264 . 7 macrophages also express SR - B1 41 , so we analyzed exosome uptake in these cells after HDL NP treatment . As was observed with HMVECs , HDL NPs decreased the uptake of exosomes , and hHDL had no effect ( Fig . 7b ) . These ex vivo proof - of - concept experiments not only demonstrate that HDL NPs block exosome uptake in cell types shown to be important for melanoma progression , but also suggest that HDL NP may therapeutically modulate intercellular communication events that are critical for melanoma progression . Discussion Our data demonstrate that HDL NPs are a targeted and functional nanoconjugate that potently inhibit cellular exosome uptake in cultured melanoma , endothelial , and macrophage cells . Mechanistically , a Figure 4 . HDL NPs block the uptake of exosomes by A375 melanoma cells .

( Scale bar = 10 μ M ) ( b ) DiI - labeled exosome uptake by A375 cells with and without HDL NP treatment ( 5 , 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 nm HDL NP , 24 hrs ) was analyzed using flow cytometry .

( d ) Dose dependent recovery of exosome uptake in A375 cells treated with HDL NPs ( 50 nm , 24 hrs ) by anti - SR - B1 antibody . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 8 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 15724 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep15724 model ( Fig . 8a , b ) is proposed for HDL NPs whereby tight binding to SR - B1 in lipid rafts modulates free and esterified cholesterol flux through this receptor . Ultimately , HDL NP binding to SR - B1 and modulat - ing free cholesterol flux is responsible for clustering and stagnating SR - B1 at the cell membrane . Further , HDL NP binding to SR - B1 and blocking the influx of cholesteryl ester leads to a dramatic reduction of cellular exosome uptake . This proposed mechanism is supported by data collected using hHDL and BLT - 1 whereby this combination of SR - B1 receptor occupancy and inhibition of cholesterol flux and cholesteryl ester uptake , respectively , potently inhibits cellular exosome uptake . Finally , this mechanism is specific and unique to HDL NPs , and is not shared by another particle that has a gold core and altered , non - HDL - like surface chemistry ; by other means of inhibiting SR - B1 using single , targeted agents ( i . e . blocking Ab or BLT - 1 ) ; or by knocking down the cellular expression level of SR - B1 ( Fig . 8c ) . The combination of HDL NPs and cellular exosome uptake provides a unique nanoparticle and phe - notypic output signal that evidently uncouples targeted SR - B1 receptor binding from cholesterol flux to uncover a phenotype that is clearly impacted by local cell membrane cholesterol and cholesteryl ester flux . Further work is required to better understand downstream molecular events that occur upon func - tional HDL NP binding to SR - B1 . Certainly , we appreciate that HDL NPs binding to SR - B1 illicit different Figure 5 . Targeting SR - B1 to induce receptor clustering and inhibit exosome uptake .

We anticipate that different cholesterol - dependent phenotypes will be uncovered in other model systems . Finally , we are currently exploring the functional consequences of inhibiting cellular communication events mediated by exosomes in the context of primary and metastatic melanoma models , and beyond . In summary , our data implicate SR - B1 in the cellular uptake of exosomes in the context of targeted , functional HDL NPs that may prove to be a valuable tool to better understand cholesterol - dependent cel - lular uptake mechanisms of exosomes and , perhaps more broadly , other extracellular vesicles . Extension of our findings in melanoma cells to endothelial cells and macrophages suggests that the unique mecha - nism by which exosome uptake is inhibited by HDL NPs may be more general . Further work is focused on elucidating the functional consequences of inhibiting exosome - based information transfer between cells , and identifying cell - signaling pathways that may be altered by HDL NP binding to SR - B1 that may contribute to the observed reduction in cellular exosome uptake .

Next , the phospholip - ids , 1 - 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine and 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanola - mine - N - [ 3 - ( 2 - pyridyldithio ) propionate ] were added at 250 molar excess relative to [ AuNP ] in a mixture of ethanol and water ( 1 : 4 ) , and allowed to incubate at RT for 4 hours with gentle stirring . The HDL NPs were then purified and concentrated using tangential flow filtration . The HDL NP concentration and final conjugate size were determined using UV - Vis spectrophotometry ( ε AuNP = 9 . 696 × 10 6 M − 1 cm − 1 at λ max = 520 nm ) and dynamic light scattering ( DLS , Malvern Zetasizer ) , respectively . Cell Culture . A375 melanoma cells ( ATCC ) and RAW 264 . 7 macrophages ( ATCC ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin / Figure 6 . Expression of SR - B1 is required for HDL NP - mediated inhibition of exosome uptake . Wild - type A375 melanoma cells were treated with scrambled siRNA or siRNA - targeted to SR - B1 . ( a ) Western blot reveals a reduction in SR - B1 expression in A375 cells at 48 hours after transfection with targeted siRNA . No reduction is measured in cells treated with scrambled siRNA . ( b ) Flow cytometry reveals a drastic reduction in labeled exosome uptake in the presence of HDL NPs ( 50 nm ) in the cells treated with scrambled siRNA after 24 hours treatment . However , no significant reduction in labeled exosome uptake is observed upon HDL NP treatment in the case where siRNA expression has been reduced . The mean fluorescent intensity values ( log scale ) are included next to each histogram . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 10 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 15724 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep15724 streptomycin . Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells ( HMVECs ) and endothelial cell growth medium were from Promocell . Cells were incubated at 37 °C and in a humidified 5 % CO 2 environ - ment . The GFP - SR - B1 plasmid 37 was stably transfected in the A375 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) and transfectants were selected using Geneticin ( Life Technologies ) followed by fluores - cent associated cell sorting ( FACS ) . Exosome isolation and labeling . A375 melanoma exosomes were isolated from conditioned media using differential ultracentrifugation 33 . In brief , cells were cultured in exosome deficient media for 72 hours at which point the cell culture media was collected and centrifuged at 2000 × g to remove dead cells and debris . Next , larger vesicles and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10 , 000 × g for 30 min - utes . Exosomes were then pelleted by centrifugation at 100 , 000 × g for 70 minutes , and subsequently washed in PBS by another 100 , 000 × g centrifugation step for 70 minutes . Exosomes were re - suspended in PBS . Protein concentration of exosomes was analyzed by BCA Protein assay ( Thermo Scientific ) . Exosome size and morphology was characterized using DLS and transmission electron microscopy ( FEI Spirit G2 TEM ) . In the experiments utilizing fluorescently labeled exosomes , the lipophilic dye , DiI or DiD ( Life Technologies ) , was added to the exosome preparation at a concentration of 2 . 5 μ M after the first 100 , 000 × g ultracentrifugation step . The fluorophore - labeled exosomes were then washed twice in PBS by pelleting the exosomes and discarding the supernatant . Notably , gold nanoparticles demonstrate distance - dependent fluorescence quenching 43 . In order to test if HDL NPs quenched exosome fluores - cence , we incubated HDL NPs with fluorescently labeled exosomes for 4 hours and then measured the Figure 7 . HDL NPs inhibit the uptake of melanoma exosomes by endothelial cells and macrophages . ( a ) HMVECs were treated with 1 μ g / mL of DiI labeled exosomes and visualized using fluorescence microscopy after treatment with 25 nm HDL NP or hHDL for 24 hrs . The actin cytoskeleton was stained using a FITC - phalloidin conjugate and the nuclei were stained with DAPI . The exosome uptake of HMVECs after treatment with HDL NPs was compared to hHDL treatment and untreated cells . ( b ) RAW 264 . 7 macrophages were treated with 1 μ g / mL of DiI labeled exosomes and visualized using fluorescence microscopy after treatment with 25 nm HDL NP or hHDL for 4 hrs . ( Scale bar : 10 μ M ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 11 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 15724 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep15724 fluorescent signal . Data demonstrate no reduction in fluorescence indicating that this is not a mechanism of reduced fluorescence in our measurements ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Cell treatments with hHDL and HDL NP . For cholesterol determination assays , efflux assays , and cell treatments we used equimolar amounts of hHDL and HDL NPs based upon apo A - I concentration . The molar concentration of HDL NP was determined as discussed above , and each HDL NP has approx - imately three copies of apo A - I 26 , 27 . Therefore , the molar concentration of apo A - I is easily calculated for the HDL NPs . Human HDL was purchased from Calbiochem . The protein concentration of purchased hHDL was provided . From this value , the amount of apo A - I was calculated for hHDL assuming that 70 % of the total protein is apo A - I 22 . Thus , for each treatment the amount of apo A - I is equivalent for hHDL and HDL NP and , because each hHDL and HDL NP has approximately three copies of apo A - I 44 , the dose of particles was assumed to be equivalent . Exosome uptake assays . The cellular uptake of exosomes was measured by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry after cell treatments . A375 cells , HMVECs and RAW 264 . 7 macrophages were treated with fluorescent exosomes at a concentration of 1 μ g / ml ( exosomal protein ) . For fluorescence microscopy experiments , cells were plated on coverslips coated with 0 . 1 % gelatin . Exosome uptake was measured over the course of 24 hours using a BD LSR Fortessa flow cytometer ( Robert H . Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core ) or a Nikon A1R fluorescence microscope ( Northwestern University Nikon Imaging Facility ) . Cholesterol and cholesteryl ester quantification . The total cholesterol and cholesteryl ester con - tent of hHDLs and HDL NPs was measured using an Amplex Red cholesterol detection assay ( Life Technologies ) . The free cholesterol content of each sample was measured in the absence and presence of cholesterol esterase to determine the free cholesterol and total cholesterol , respectively . Cholesteryl ester amount was determined by subtracting the free cholesterol from total cholesterol measurement . To determine the free and esterified cholesterol content of hHDL and HDL NPs before cell incubation we followed the protocol supplied by the manufacturer . The free and esterified cholesterol content of the hHDL and HDL NP acceptors was measured after incubating with cultured A375 melanoma cells in serum free media and HDL NP ( 50 nm , final ) or hHDL ( 50 nm , final ) for 24 hours . After the treatment interval , the culture media was collected and centrifuged to rid the media of cells and cell debris . The total cholesterol and free cholesterol was then determined from conditioned media samples using the Amplex Red assay . Cholesterol efflux assay . A375 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 1 μ Ci / mL [ 1 , 2 , - 3 H ] cho - lesterol ( Perkin - Elmer ) overnight to label the cellular cholesterol pool . Cells were then washed in PBS and resuspended in serum free media . Human HDL or HDL NPs were added to the culture media and Figure 8 . Summary of proposed mechanism by which HDL NPs inhibit exosome uptake : ( a ) In the presence of hHDL cellular exosome uptake is maintained . Through SR - B1 , hHDL can remove cellular cholesterol and is a source of esterified cholesterol . ( b ) HDL NPs bind SR - B1 and efflux cholesterol from the cell more efficiently than hHDL ( darker arrow ) and are not a source of esterified cholesterol ( blocked arrow ) . This leads to SR - B1 receptor clustering and potent reduction in cellular exosome uptake . ( c ) Table that enables easy comparisons to be made between different cell treatments , their function , and the resulting phenotypic clustering and exosome uptake results . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 12 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 15724 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep15724 allowed to incubate for 6 hours . Cell culture media was then collected and subjected to liquid scintilla - tion counting . The percentage of cholesterol efflux was determined by using the formula counts media / ( counts cells + counts media ) × 100 . Efflux of cholesterol in the absence of an acceptor was also measured and interpreted along with other results . Computer vision analysis of GFP - SR - B1 domains , intensity , and dynamics . A semi - automated approach using ImageJ software was employed to identify the areas of GFP - SR - B1 in the images . After background subtraction , an unsharp mask filter with a large radius was applied to locally enhance con - trast . Manual thresholding of filtered images was then used to generate a segment mask , which could be overlaid on the original , background subtracted image to facilitate measurement of domain parameters such as area and mean intensity . To test differences in the dynamics properties of the GFP - SR - B1 domains , we identified in automated fashion the center of mass of the spots using a wavelet - based segmentation approach 38 and tracked their displacement 39 . The method used solves a global combinatorial optimization problem whose solution identifies the overall most likely links of particle trajectories throughout a movie . It allows the tracking of the heterogeneous domain motion both during phases of diffusive and linear motion . During the linking part of the algorithm , we allowed speeds of up to 42 microns / min , as we observed some very rapid motion . We did not use the gap closing option of the algorithm , as the fluorescent labeling was consistently bright and the GFP - SR - B1 motion did not result in occlusion . We included in our dynamics analysis tracks with a lifetime of over four frames . To calculate the linearity of the motion , we introduced a parameter rho ( Fig . 3c ) , which is calculated as the ratio between the head - to - tail ( first point to the end point ) trajectory distance divided by the total distance traveled by fluorescent domains . This way , a trajectory with rho close to 1 signifies a linearly moving spot and a trajectory with rho close to 0 signifies randomly moving spots . For this analysis , we excluded all stationary areas by considering spots that moved a pixel per frame one average or more . Western Blotting . For Western blot , 20 μ g of total protein extract or 10 μ g of exosomal protein were resolved on Tris / Glycine / SDS pre - cast polyacrylamide gels ( a 4 – 20 % gradient , Bio - Rad , 30 minutes at 200 volts ) . Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes . The membranes were blocked in 5 % milk in Tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( TBST ) . The membranes were incubated with d primary antibodies ( diluted in blocking solution ) overnight at 4 °C , was washed 3 times in 0 . 1 % TBST ( 10 minutes / wash ) and incubated with the appropriate HRP - conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature . The membranes were then washed in 0 . 1 % TBST ( 3 × 10 min ) and developed with ECL kit ( GE Healthcare ) . Antibodies : CD81 and GM130 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , SR - B1 ( Abcam ) , β - Actin ( Cell Signaling Technology ) Lipid raft labeling . A375 lipid rafts were labeled using cholera toxin subunit b ( CTx - B ) conjugates with Alexafluor 488 or Alexafluor 647 to ( Life Technologies ) at a final concentration 1 μ g / ml , for 30 min - utes at 37 °C 21 . The cells were then washed in PBS . And visualized using fluorescence microscopy . Knockdown of SR - B1 . SR - B1 was knocked down using siRNA targeted to SR - B1 ( Ambion ) . In brief , SR - B1 siRNA and a non - targeted scrambled control were transfected into cells using RNAi Max ( Life Technologies ) . The RNAi Max and RNA were allowed to incubate with the cells for 16 hrs . Cells were then washed free of the transfection reagent , fresh culture media was added , and then incubated for an additional 24 hours prior to cell treatments with exosomes and HDL NP . SR - B1 knockdown was meas - ured using western blot . Fluorescence microscopy . Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an A1R confocal micro - scope with assistance from the Northwestern University Center for Advanced Microscopy . Images were analyzed using NIS Elements ( Nikon ) and ImageJ ( NIH ) software . Live cell confocal fluorescence micros - copy to assess lipid raft dynamics was performed with a Nikon Eclipse T1 microscope equipped with an Andor iXon Ultra 897 camera and analyzed using Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices ) . Statistical analysis . Data was expressed using ± standard deviation of triplicate experiments . The unpaired two tailed student’s t - test from GraphPad Prism software was used to analyze data . Statistical significance was considered for significant for P ≤ 0 . 05 . * Denotes P ≤ 0 . 05 , * * P ≤ 0 . 01 , and * * * P ≤ 0 . 001 . FCS Express was used to analyze flow cytometry . Statistical analysis between the conditions ( before and after HDL NP treatment ) of GFP - SR - B1 , integrated normalized intensity , and motion was performed using a permutation test 45 for means , which does not assume normality of the underlying distributions .
