CENP - A , a centromere - specific histone H3 variant , establishes the foundations for centromere epigenetic memory and kinetochore assembly . It recruits the constitutive centromere - associated network ( CCAN ) , which in turn assembles the microtubule - binding interface . How the specific organization of centromeric chromatin relates to kinetochore assembly and to centromere identity through cell division remains conjectural . Here , we break new ground by reconstituting a functional full - length version of CENP - C , the largest human CCAN subunit and a blueprint of kinetochore assembly . We show that full - length CENP - C , a dimer , binds stably to two nucleosomes , and permits further assembly of all other kinetochore subunits in vitro with relative ratios that closely match those of endogenous human kinetochores . Our results imply that human kinetochores emerge from clustering multiple copies of a fundamental module , and may have important implications for trans - generational inheritance of centromeric chromatin . Introduction In addition to the hereditary information enshrined in the genetic code , chromosomes carry a wealth of additional epigenetic information that controls their structure and accessibility in time and space . Epigenetic information is usually implemented through covalent modifications of the DNA itself , or through modifications of the histones , proteins that pack DNA into nucleosomes , the fundamental organizational unit of eukaryotic genomes ( Allis and Jenuwein , 2016 ) . In addition to these well - studied mechanisms , a most striking and unconventional example of epigenetic determination subtends to the establishment and maintenance of centromere identity ( Fukagawa and Earnshaw , 2014 ; McKinley and Cheeseman , 2016 ; Musacchio and Desai , 2017 ) . Centromeres are unique chromatin loci of the eukaryotic chromosome . They seed the assembly of kinetochores , large protein complexes that establish a point of contact between chromosomes and spindle microtubules during mitosis and meiosis ( Musacchio and Desai , 2017 ) . The realization over 20 years ago that centromere identity , with few exceptions , is established in a DNA - sequence - independent manner , triggered a crucial conceptual leap in centromere studies and redirected the spotlight onto the molecular basis of centromere persistence through cell division ( Karpen and Allshire , 1997 ) . A most characteristic and almost ubiquitous trait of centromeres is the enrichment of the histone H3 - like centromeric protein A ( CENP - A ) ( Earnshaw and Rothfield , 1985 ; Sullivan et al . , 1994 ) . Like H3 , CENP - A forms a tight tetramer with H4 , which additionally binds two H2A : H2B 3 dimers to form an octameric nucleosome core particle ( Black and Cleveland , 2011 ) . The CENP - A nucleosome is surrounded by a group of 16 proteins collectively named the constitutive centromere associated network ( CCAN ) and organized in different stable sub - complexes ( Foltz et al . , 2006 ; Hinshaw and Harrison , 2019 ; Izuta et al . , 2006 ; Obuse et al . , 2004 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ; Yan et al . , 2019 ) . Two CCAN subunits , CENP - N and CENP - C , interact directly with CENP - A ( Carroll et al . , 2010 ; Carroll et al . , 2009 ; Kato et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , CENP - C , predicted to be predominantly intrinsically disordered , interacts with several other CCAN subunits to stabilize the overall globular assembly of CCAN ( Hinshaw and Harrison , 2013 ; Hinshaw and Harrison , 2019 ; Klare et al . , 2015 ; McKinley et al . , 2015 ; Nagpal et al . , 2015 ; Pentakota et al . , 2017 ; Tanaka et al . , 2009 ; Watanabe et al . , 2019 ; Weir et al . , 2016 ; Yan et al . , 2019 ) . CENP - C and another CCAN subunit , CENP - T , also provide a platform for the assembly of the kinetochore’s outer layer ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ; Przewloka et al . , 2011 ; Screpanti et al . , 2011 ) . The latter comprises three further sub - complexes , known as the KNL1 , MIS12 , and NDC80 complexes , and collectively referred to as the KMN network ( Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ) . Besides important regulatory functions , the KMN network , through its NDC80 complex ( NDC80C ) , provides a site for binding spindle microtubules , an interaction that promotes the alignment and segregation of chromosomes to the daughter cells ( Cheeseman et al . , 2006 ; DeLuca et al . , 2006 ) . Kinetochores across eukaryotes display significant differences in complexity . The S . cerevisiae kinetochore assembles around ~ 125 base pairs ( bp ) of a defined centromeric DNA sequence ( and therefore not epigenetically ) that wraps around a single CENP - A Cse4 nucleosome , and binds a single microtubule , for which reasons it is identified as a ‘point’ kinetochore . Conversely , kinetochores in the majority of eukaryotes are identified as ‘regional’ because they extend over much larger centromeric DNA segments ( up to Mbp in humans ) , expose multiple CENP - A nucleosomes , and bind multiple microtubules ( Musacchio and Desai , 2017 ) . This extreme range of complexity raises the question whether regional kinetochores are built by patching together multiple copies of a “unit module” related to the point kinetochore of S . cerevisiae . This idea remains untested , but it is plausible and several observations support it . First , subunit composition and physical interactions appear to be largely conserved in point and regional kinetochores , as demonstrated by comprehensive biochemical reconstitutions and structural analyses ( Hinshaw and Harrison , 2019 ; Klare et al . , 2015 ; McKinley et al . , 2015 ; Pekgoz Altunkaya et al . , 2016 ; Pesenti et al . , 2018 ; Weir et al . , 2016 ; Yan et al . , 2019 ) . Second , the relative ratios of kinetochore subunits appear to be conserved in point and regional kinetochores , suggesting regional kinetochores emerge from the multiplication of a fundamental point module ( Joglekar et al . , 2009 ; Joglekar et al . , 2008 ; Joglekar et al . , 2006 ; Suzuki et al . , 2015 ; Wan et al . , 2009 ) . Finally , the same relative subunit ratios observed at human kinetochores are also observed 4 in partial reconstitutions of single , discrete particles of human kinetochores ( Pesenti et al . , 2018 ; Suzuki et al . , 2015 ; Weir et al . , 2016 ) , once again suggesting that the larger assembly is created by convolution of individual modules . From a reductionist perspective , this hypothesis raises the crucial question whether an individual module recapitulates some or even all fundamental properties of the regional structure , including promotion of bi - orientation and epigenetic specification and inheritance . Answering this question may have important technological implications , particularly towards the development of artificial chromosomes , but is technically and conceptually challenging . Despite very considerable progress in our understanding of the structural organization of the core protein complex surrounding the CENP - A nucleosome ( Hinshaw and Harrison , 2019 ; Pesenti et al . , 2018 ; Yan et al . , 2019 ) , there is persistent uncertainty on the organization of the continuous segment of centromeric chromatin underlying regional kinetochores . For example , even if CENP - A is greatly enriched within human centromeric chromatin in comparison to chromosome arms , it is surrounded and vastly outnumbered by histone H3 ( Bodor et al . , 2014 ) . Various models for the organization of regional centromeric chromatin have been discussed ( Fukagawa and Earnshaw , 2014 ) , but conclusive evidence to support one or the other is missing . Furthermore , despite progress in the isolation of point kinetochores ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2010 ; Lang et al . , 2018 ) , there are no robust procedures for the isolation of individual modules from natural regional kinetochores . To address these limitations , we applied bottom - up approaches based on biochemical reconstitution of human kinetochore sub - structures of increasing complexity , followed by iterative assessments and validation of their functional and structural properties in comparison to those of real kinetochores , for instance with regard to the role of KMN multivalency in kinetochore - microtubule attachment ( Huis In ' t Veld et al . , 2016 ; Huis In ' t Veld et al . , 2019 ; Volkov et al . , 2018 ) . Here , we engineered for the first time a full - length , dimeric form of human CENP - C . This allowed us to dissect how oligomerization and multivalency of CENP - C reflects on kinetochore assembly and the underlying chromatin . We demonstrate that full - length CENP - C can bind concomitantly to two individual nucleosomes , or to two adjacent nucleosomes in a dinucleosome . We show that this organization supports the robust recruitment of all other kinetochore subunits with predicted stoichiometries , and we present a thorough dissection of the interactions that make this possible . Our studies represent an important step towards the reconstitution of a minimal regional kinetochore module . Results 5 Reconstitution of full - length CENP - C ( CENP - C F ) by protein fusion Human CENP - C is a 943 - residue protein ( Figure 1A ) . Its N - terminal region interacts with the MIS12 complex ( MIS12C ) ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ; Petrovic et al . , 2016 ; Przewloka et al . , 2011 ; Screpanti et al . , 2011 ) . The following PEST ( Proline - Glutamic acid - Serine - Threonine ) - rich region binds the CENP - HIKM and CENP - NL CCAN subcomplexes ( Hinshaw and Harrison , 2013 ; Klare et al . , 2015 ; McKinley et al . , 2015 ; Nagpal et al . , 2015 ; Pentakota et al . , 2017 ) . The central region encompasses a CENP - A - selective binding motif ( indicated as ‘1’ in Figure 1A ) that interacts with an exposed acidic patch on histones H2A and H2B as well as with the C - terminal tail of CENP - A ( Carroll et al . , 2010 ; Guse et al . , 2011 ; Kato et al . , 2013 ) . It is required for robust kinetochore localization of CENP - C ( Carroll et al . , 2010 ; Guo et al . , 2017 ; Heeger et al . , 2005 ; Milks et al . , 2009 ; Song et al . , 2002 ; Tanaka et al . , 2009 ) . The constellation of N - terminal region , PEST , and central region spans the entire depth of the kinetochore from its outer domain until the centromere , and we have speculated that it provides spatial clues ( a blueprint ) for kinetochore assembly ( Klare et al . , 2015 ) . Implicit in this analogy is that CENP - C promotes cooperative interactions of kinetochore subunits that enhance the overall stability of the inner kinetochore complex . Indeed , a fragment of CENP - C encompassing MIS12C binding site , PEST , and central region ( CENP - C 1 - 544 ) was sufficient to reconstitute a recombinant 26 - subunit kinetochore particle with a CENP - A nucleosome core particle ( CENP - A NCP ) and the majority of CCAN and KMN subunits ( Klare et al . , 2015 ; Pesenti et al . , 2018 ; Weir et al . , 2016 ) . The functional properties of the complementary segment , CENP - C 545 - 943 , remain more enigmatic . The C - terminal Cupin domain ( Dunwell et al . , 2001 ) promotes dimerization of CENP - C ( Chik et al . , 2019 ; Cohen et al . , 2008 ; Sugimoto et al . , 1997 ; Trazzi et al . , 2009 ; Xiao et al . , 2017 ) . The other functionally relevant segment is the CENP - C motif ( indicated as ‘2’ in Figure 1A and also known as ‘conserved motif’ ) , whose sequence is strongly related to that of the central region ( Figure S1A ) . The CENP - C motif also binds CENP - A NCPs , but less robustly than the central region , and less selectively , as it binds CENP - A NCPs and H3 NCPs with similar binding affinities ( Ali - Ahmad et al . , 2019 ; Kato et al . , 2013 ; Watanabe et al . , 2019 ) . The significance of the duplication of nucleosome - binding motifs in HsCENP - C remains unclear , but suggests that a CENP - C dimer may interact with more than one nucleosome . To dissect this aspect of CENP - C organization and recapitulate in vitro expected increases in complex stability arising from dimerization , full - length CENP - C would be invaluable , but obtaining it has proven difficult due to insolubility upon recombinant expression in different hosts ( our unpublished observations ) . To overcome this technical hurdle , we sought to obtain full - length CENP - C from fusing two complementary segments of CENP - C with the Spy - 6 tag / Spy - catcher system , which allows the covalent fusion of two polypeptide chains through formation of an isopeptide bond ( Zakeri et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 1B ) . We tested the efficiency of the fusion reaction with two complementary constructs collectively encompassing the entire CENP - C sequence , CENP - C 1 - 600 and CENP - C 601 - 943 . These constructs respectively include the central region and the CENP - C motif , and connect through a poorly conserved fragment , thus reducing the likelihood of functional inactivation . In isolation , CENP - C 1 - 600 and CENP - C 601 - 943 bound with CENP - A NCPs in size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) experiments ( Figure S1B - C ) . We purified MBP CENP - C 1 - 600 - Spycatcher ( where MBP stands for maltose - binding protein , an affinity tag ; Figure S2A ) and Spytag CENP - C 601 - 943 , mixed them , and incubated them together for 16 hours to obtain the ligation product MBP CENP - C 1 - 600 - Spy - 601 - 943 ( herewith usually referred to as MBP CENP - C F , for CENP - C fusion ; Figure S2B ) . The latter was separated from the excess of non - ligated fragments using SEC , obtaining a product of sufficient purity for further biochemical analyses ( Figure S2C ) . We performed SEC experiments to assess if MBP CENP - C F retains the ability to interact with CENP - A NCPs . MBP CENP - C F and CENP - A NCPs interacted robustly and eluted in an apparently stoichiometric complex from the SEC column ( when mixed at 1 : 2 molar ratio , the significance of which will be discussed more thoroughly below ) ( Figure S2D , yellow trace ) . Importantly , MBP CENP - C F bound only weakly to H3 NCPs , as revealed by an only modest shift in the elution volume of H3 NCPs , indicative of a low - affinity , rapidly dissociating interaction ( Figure S2E , black trace ) . Thus , MBP CENP - C F binds selectively to CENP - A NCPs over H3 NCPs , a conclusion further supported by competition experiments with electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( KW and AM , unpublished results ) . CENP - C F is functional As a stringent test to establish if CENP - C F is functional , we asked if it localized to kinetochores and if it complemented the loss of endogenous CENP - C . For this , we used a previously reported colorectal adenocarcinoma DLD - 1 cell line in which both endogenous CENP - C alleles were C - terminally tagged with an auxin inducible degron ( AID ) and EYFP ( Fachinetti et al . , 2015 ; Guo et al . , 2017 ; Holland et al . , 2012 ; Nishimura et al . , 2009 ) . Upon addition of the auxin derivative indole acetic acid ( IAA ) , endogenous CENP - C was efficiently depleted within 30 to 60 minutes ( Figure S3A - B ) , as described ( Fachinetti et al . , 2015 ; Guo et al . , 2017 ) . Using the same fusion strategy that allowed us to obtain MBP CENP - C F , we generated mCherry CENP - C F , and demonstrated that it also interacts with CENP - A NCPs and that it localizes to kinetochores of HeLa cells ( Figure S2F - G and Figure S3C ) . Next , we asked if mCherry CENP - C F localized at kinetochores of DLD - 1 cells depleted of the endogenous CENP - C AID - EYFP . We electroporated 7 mCherry CENP - C F into DLD - 1 cells undergoing a 12 h IAA treatment to achieve complete removal of the endogenous CENP - C AID - EYFP . mCherry CENP - C F , but not an mCherry control , was readily identified at kinetochores , as indicated by overlapping mCherry and CREST ( a centromere marker ) signals , despite undetectable endogenous CENP - C AID - EYFP ( Figure S3D ) . Thus , centromere localization of mCherry CENP - C F did not require endogenous CENP - C . After incorporation into chromatin , CENP - A remains stably associated with centromeres even after removal of CENP - C ( Cao et al . , 2018 ; Carroll et al . , 2010 ; Watanabe et al . , 2019 ) , suggesting that CENP - A directs re - recruitment of mCherry CENP - C F after electroporation in CENP - C - depleted cells . Finally , we assessed if mCherry CENP - C F complemented the deleterious consequences on chromosome alignment caused by CENP - C AID - EYFP depletion . 79 % of untreated cells reached metaphase alignment , against 20 % in cells treated with IAA to deplete CENP - C AID - EYFP ( Figure 1C ) . Electroporated mCherry CENP - C F entirely rescued the effects of CENP - C AID - EYFP depletion , with > 80 % of mCherry CENP - C F - positive cells displaying metaphase alignment . Collectively , these results provide strong evidence that mCherry CENP - C F is functional . CENP - C F binds the outer kinetochore Mif2p , the S . cerevisiae orthologue of CENP - C , adopts an auto - inhibited conformation that suppresses the ability of its N - terminal region to interact with the Mtw1C Mis12C complex before binding to Cse4 CENP - A nucleosomes ( Killinger et al . , 2020 ) . To assess if this was also true of human CENP - C F , we immobilized MBP CENP - C F and incubated it with MIS12C , NDC80C , or their combination . MIS12C bound in apparently stoichiometric amounts to CENP - C and attracted NDC80C when the complexes were combined ( Figure 1D - E ) , arguing that the MIS12C binding motif of MBP CENP - C F is fully exposed . As explained below , the interaction of CENP - T with the MIS12C and NDC80C is regulated by cyclin - dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) phosphorylation . To assess if phosphorylation created additional binding sites for the outer kinetochore also on MBP CENP - C F , we phosphorylated it with CDK1 : Cyclin B . This caused a prominent electrophoretic migration shift of MBP CENP - C F , indicative of successful phosphorylation , but did not modify the stoichiometry of outer kinetochore subunits ( Figure 1F ) . Importantly , CENP - C binding of outer kinetochore subunits was limited to the previously identified N - terminal MIS12C binding motif ( Screpanti et al . , 2011 ) , because it was ablated when the motif was mutated ( construct 2 , Figure 1F - G ) . Thus , collectively , CENP - C F is not auto - inhibited and is a target of CDK1 phosphorylation , but the latter does not generate additional binding sites for outer kinetochore subunits . 8 Role of CENP - C dimerization The C - terminal Cupin domains of the D . melanogaster and S . cerevisiae CENP - Cs ( DmCENP - C 1127 - 1410 and Mif2 321 - 529 , respectively , depicted in Figure 2A ) form tight dimers ( Chik et al . , 2019 ; Cohen et al . , 2008 ; Medina - Pritchard et al . , 2020 ; Trazzi et al . , 2009 ) . Sedimentation velocity analytical centrifugation ( AUC ) and SEC demonstrated that the human CENP - C Cupin domain also forms monodisperse , tight dimers ( Figure 2B and Figure S4A ; note that MBP is a monomer , as shown previously ( Pan et al . , 2017 ) ) . When expressed in interphase HeLa cells depleted of endogenous CENP - C ( Figure S4B ) , GFP - CENP - C 721 - 943 or GFP - CENP - C 760 - 943 failed to localize to kinetochores , whereas weak localization was observed in presence of endogenous CENP - C ( Figure S4C - F ) , likely because of dimerization of the cupin domain . When transfected in human cells together with full - length GFP CENP - C , only Hs mCherry CENP - C 773 - 943 , but not Dm mCherry CENP - C 1127 - 1410 nor Sc mCherry Mif2p 321 - 529 , formed dimers with Hs GFP CENP - C ( Figure 2C ) and localized , albeit weakly , to kinetochores ( Figure 2D - E ) . Thus , Hs GFP CENP - C does not appreciably bind the fly or yeast CENP - C Cupin domains , revealing a strong preference for intra - species homodimerization of the Cupin domain . When expressed ectopically in HeLa cells , a construct lacking the Cupin domain , HsCENP - C 1 - 772 , localized very weakly to kinetochores , ( Figure 2F - H and Figure S4G ) . Conversely , chimeric constructs of HsCENP - C 1 - 772 and the fly or yeast Cupin domains , or even with the LacI dimerization domain , restored very robust kinetochore localization . We conclude that dimerization through the Cupin domain stabilizes kinetochore CENP - C , likely through enforcement of multivalent interactions with other CCAN subunits . CENP - C F binds two CENP - A nucleosomes Because CENP - C F encompasses two nucleosome - binding motifs , its dimerization through the Cupin domain generates a dimer with four nucleosome - binding motifs . Due to its pseudo - two - fold symmetric organization , a nucleosome core particle ( NCP ) may contain two binding sites for the CENP - C motifs , so that a CENP - C homodimer might be expected to interact with at least two NCPs , or more if further oligomerization came into play . To test this , we performed SEC experiments to assess how CENP - A NCPs interacts with CENP - C F . As controls , we also included three CENP - C F variants in which the central region , the CENP - C motif , or both had been mutated to impair CENP - A NCP binding ( Kato et al . , 2013 ) . Point mutations directed against conserved residues in the central region or in the CENP - C motif ( CENP - C 1 - 600 - R522A / W531A or CENP - C 601 - 943 - R742A / W751A , respectively ) abolished CENP - A binding ( Figure S1B - C ) , indicating that each set of mutations is highly penetrant in isolation . 9 CENP - A NCPs combined with MBP CENP - C F at 2 : 1 molar ratio ( 5 µ M CENP - A NCP and 2 . 5 µ M CENP - C , dimer concentration ) eluted from the SEC column almost entirely in one peak , with no residual free CENP - A NCPs ( Figure 3A , E and Figure S5A ) , implying that the four CENP - C motifs in the dimeric CENP - C F provide binding sites for at least two CENP - A NCPs . Conversely , CENP - C containing two non - functional CENP - C motifs did not interact with CENP - A at all ( Figure 3B , E and Figure S5B ) . Importantly , CENP - C F - R522A / W531A and CENP - C F - R742A / W751A bound only one equivalent of CENP - A NCP , rather than two as CENP - C F ( Figure 3C - D , E and Figure S5C - D ) . These stoichiometries were inferred both from the absorbance intensities of the peaks eluting from the SEC column , and from the intensity of histone bands in Coomassie - stained SDS - PAGE of the CENP - C F - bound fractions ( Figure 3E ) . In an orthogonal approach , we used sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation ( AUC ) to assess the molecular mass of the CENP - C F : CENP - A NCP complex obtained at the 2 : 1 molar ratio . These experiments revealed an excellent agreement between the expected and predicted molecular mass for a complex containing a CENP - C F dimer and two CENP - A NCPs , with apparently little additional contamination from complexes of different stoichiometry ( Figure 3F and Figure S6A - D ) . Furthermore , deletion of the CENP - C motif resulted in a complex containing a single CENP - A NCP , again with an excellent agreement between the theoretical and expected molecular masses . Collectively , these experiments indicate that a CENP - C F dimer has an intrinsic potential to bind two CENP - A NCPs , without forming significant amounts of additional higher molecular weight species that might potentially arise when combining multivalent binding partners like CENP - C and NCPs . CENP - C interacts with CENP - A also through the CENP - HIKMLN complex CENP - N , like CENP - C , interacts directly with CENP - A NCPs by recognizing the CENP - A L1 loop ( Allu et al . , 2019 ; Cao et al . , 2018 ; Chittori et al . , 2018 ; Pentakota et al . , 2017 ; Tian et al . , 2018 ) . CENP - C , on the other hand , interacts with the acidic patch of H2A - H2B and with the CENP - A C - terminal tail ( Ali - Ahmad et al . , 2019 ; Allu et al . , 2019 ; Cao et al . , 2018 ; Carroll et al . , 2010 ; Kato et al . , 2013 ; Weir et al . , 2016 ; Yan et al . , 2019 ) . These features may allow CENP - C and CENP - N to bind concomitantly to their cognate binding sites on the same CENP - A nucleosome ( Allu et al . , 2019 ) , although an alternative binding model where CENP - N occupies a non - canonical position has been recently proposed ( Yan et al . , 2019 ) . Because CENP - NL ( and CENP - HIKM ) interact tightly with CENP - C also through the PEST region ( Klare et al . , 2015 ; Pentakota et al . , 2017 ) ( Figure 1A ) , CENP - C may be expected to enable an additional contact of CCAN with the CENP - A nucleosome through CENP - N . 10 To investigate this possibility , we immobilized three MBP - tagged CENP - C F variants on amylose beads and used them as baits with CENP - A NCPs and CCAN sub - complexes ( Figure 4A ) . Specifically , we used CENP - C F , CENP - C F - R522A / W531A / R742A / W751A ( indicated as ‘nucleosome binding mutant’ ) , and a nucleosome binding mutant additionally impaired in the interaction with CENP - NL and CENP - HIKM through previously described point mutations ( Klare et al . , 2015 ; Pentakota et al . , 2017 ) ( and indicated as ‘nucleosome and CCAN binding mutant’ ) . We then incubated these baits with saturating concentrations of CENP - A NCPs , CENP - HIKMLN , or their combination . After washing , species retained on beads were resolved by SDS - PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining . This revealed that CENP - C F binds the same levels of CENP - A NCPs and CENP - HIKMLN when presented individually or concomitantly ( Figure 4A ) . Conversely , the CENP - A binding mutant of CENP - C F did not bind CENP - A NCPs , but retained binding to CENP - HIKMLN . When CENP - A NCPs and CENP - HIKMLN were co - incubated with this mutant , binding of CENP - A NCPs was restored , but at reduced levels . The residual CENP - A NCP was binding to this mutant through CENP - N in the CCAN complex , because the CENP - A and CCAN mutant of CENP - C F bound only residual levels of CENP - A NCPs or CENP - HIKMLN ( Figure 4A , quantified in Figure S6E ) . Thus , binding of CENP - C F to other CCAN subunits allows a robust point of contact with the CENP - A nucleosome through CENP - N ( and possibly additional still undiscovered points of contact within the CENP - HIKMLN complex ) even in the absence of functional CENP - A binding motifs . Kinetochore localization of electroporated mCherry CENP - C F in cells depleted of endogenous CENP - C YFP - AID in DLD - 1 cells demonstrated the main predictions from the in vitro assay ( Figure 4B - D ) . Specifically , CENP - C F localized robustly to kinetochores , whereas the CENP - A binding mutant showed a partial localization impairment . Likely , this mutant is targeted to the centromere by CENP - HIKM or CENP - LN , because the CCAN binding mutant , already in isolation , showed very strongly impairment of kinetochore localization . This was compounded by additional mutation of the CENP - A binding motifs , which made the construct undetectable at the kinetochore . Collectively , these observations indicate that the interaction of CENP - C with centromeres is cooperative and reflects its multiple binding sites for CENP - A and other CCAN subunits . The interaction of CENP - T with CCAN The CCAN subunits CENP - S , CENP - T , CENP - W , and CENP - X are histone - fold domain ( HFD ) proteins that associate in stable dimeric pairs ( CENP - SX and CENP - TW ) and as tetramer ( Hori et al . , 2008 ) . We reconstituted the CENP - TWSX complex to identify conditions for its 11 stable incorporation in reconstituted kinetochores . In solid phase binding assays with immobilized MBP CENP - C F ( Figure 5A - B ) we observed binding of CENP - TWSX in presence of CENP - HIKM and CENP - LN , reduced binding upon omission of CENP - LN , and poor binding upon omission of CENP - HIKM or of both CENP - HIKM and CENP - LN ( shown schematically in Figure 5C ) . Thus , CENP - HIKM , and marginally also CENP - LN , provide a binding platform for CENP - TWSW , in agreement with previous studies in S . cerevisiae ( Basilico et al . , 2014 ; Hinshaw and Harrison , 2020 ; Pekgoz Altunkaya et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . A highly conserved C - terminal helical hairpin of CENP - T ( helices a 4 and a 5 ) , which extends the HFD to complete a binding interface for the CENP - HIK complex ( Hinshaw and Harrison , 2020 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) , was required for tight binding to the MBP CENP - C F - CCAN complex in vitro as well as for its kinetochore recruitment after electroporation ( Figure 5D - E and Figure S6F - G ) . Role of CENP - T in outer kinetochore assembly CENP - T , like CENP - C , is crucial for outer kinetochore assembly ( Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ; Hara et al . , 2018 ; Huis In ' t Veld et al . , 2016 ; Lang et al . , 2018 ; Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ; Nishino et al . , 2013 ; Pekgoz Altunkaya et al . , 2016 ; Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ; Suzuki et al . , 2015 ) . The flexible N - terminal region of human CENP - T binds two distinct NDC80 complexes through motifs encompassing the CDK1 targets Thr11 and Thr85 ( Huis In ' t Veld et al . , 2016 ) . A third CDK1 phosphorylation site , Ser201 , possibly with an additional contribution from Thr195 , is further responsible for an interaction with an entire KMN network complex through a binding site on MIS12C ( Huis In ' t Veld et al . , 2016 ; Rago et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , CENP - T recruits two NDC80Cs directly and one KMN ( which contains an additional NDC80 complex ) while CENP - C , as shown above , recruits a single KMN network through MIS12C . CENP - C binds MIS12C at the interface between the Head1 region ( encompassing the N - terminal regions of the MIS12 and PMF1 subunits ) and a “connector” encompassing the a 3 helices of NSL1 and DSN1 ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 ) . The regions of NSL1 and DSN1 preceding the connector form a globular domain named Head2 ( Figure 6A - B ) . A disordered segment of DSN1 preceding Head2 contains at least two Aurora B target sites ( Ser100 DSN1 and Ser109 DSN1 ) that control access of CENP - C through an intramolecular regulatory mechanism ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2013 ; Bonner et al . , 2019 ; Dimitrova et al . , 2016 ; Kim and Yu , 2015 ; Petrovic et al . , 2016 ; Rago et al . , 2015 ; Welburn et al . , 2010 ) . CENP - C binds MIS12C with ~ 150 - fold higher affinity after Aurora B - mediated phosphorylation of Ser100 DSN1 and Ser109 DSN1 ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 ) . Deletions of the entire N - terminal region of DSN1 and NSL1 including Head2 ( indicated simply as MIS12C ∆ Head2 ) or of a 10 - residue segment encompassing the two phosphorylation sites 12 ( MIS12C ∆ 10 ) bypass the requirement for phosphorylation and allow unhindered access to CENP - C ( Kim and Yu , 2015 ; Petrovic et al . , 2016 ; Rago et al . , 2015 ) . Previously , we showed that CENP - T and CENP - C cannot be contemporarily bound to the same MIS12C ( Huis In ' t Veld et al . , 2016 ) , suggesting partial or complete overlap of their binding sites on MIS12C . Whether access of CENP - T to MIS12C is also regulated by Aurora B activity , however , is unknown . More generally , due to lack of structural information on the CENP - T : MIS12C complex , as well as of obvious resemblances in the MIS12C - binding regions of CENP - C and CENP - T , how CENP - T binds MIS12C remains unclear . To investigate this , we monitored the elution of fluorescently labelled CENP - T 1 - 373 ( Huis In ' t Veld et al . , 2016 ) from a SEC column upon addition of MIS12C . No binding of CENP - T 1 - 373 to MIS12C was observed , as the elution profile of fluorescent CENP - T 1 - 373 was essentially identical to that of CENP - T 1 - 373 in isolation ( Figure 6C ) . In absence of MIS12C , CDK1 phosphorylation caused CENP - T 1 - 373 to elute at an earlier volume , possibly because phosphorylation causes decompaction of the N - terminal domain . CDK1 phosphorylation also enhanced CENP - T 1 - 373 binding to MIS12C , as shown by a further decrease of the CENP - T 1 - 373 elution volume . A more significant shift caused by addition of Aurora B was abrogated in the presence of the Aurora B inhibitor Hesperadin ( Figure 6C ) . MIS12C DSN1 - ∆ 10 or MIS12C ∆ Head2 , which lack the Aurora B phosphorylation motif , caused a more pronounced shift in the CENP - T 1 - 373 elution volume , that was further reinforced after addition of CDK1 ( Figure 6D ) . Thus , phosphorylation of CENP - T and MIS12C by CDK1 and Aurora B , respectively , or deletion of the Aurora B target motif on MIS12C , increase the binding affinity of the MIS12C : CENP - T complex , as previously observed with CENP - C ( Kim and Yu , 2015 ; Petrovic et al . , 2016 ; Rago et al . , 2015 ) . Accordingly , a fluorescent synthetic peptide encompassing residues 184 - 215 of CENP - T and phosphorylated on Ser201 ( P - CENP - T 184 - 215 ) bound to MIS12C DSN1 - ∆ 10 with a dissociation constant of ~ 27 nM in fluorescence anisotropy binding affinity measurements , approximately 1000 - fold better than to control MIS12C ( Figure 6E and Table S1 ) . Arginine residues in the Aurora B target motif of DSN1 are important for the auto - inhibition mechanism , and their mutation to alanine ( MIS12C DSN1 - RRKAAA ) is sufficient to enhance binding to CENP - C ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 ) . We therefore speculated that these arginine residues compete directly with equivalent positively - charged residues in the N - terminal region of CENP - C ( Arg14 - Arg15 - Arg16 ; Figure 6F ) until Aurora B phosphorylation of DSN1 at neighboring serines neutralizes charge ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 ) . Because MIS12C DSN1 - RRKAAA also bound to the P - CENP - T 184 - 215 peptide more tightly than control MIS12C ( Figure 6E ) , we speculated that a conserved short stretch of positive charges in CENP - T , Arg214 and Arg215 ( Figure 6F ) plays a role equivalent to that of Arg14 - Arg16 in CENP - C . In agreement with this idea , a peptide excluding 13 this region ( CENP - T 184 - 208 instead of P - CENP - T 184 - 215 ) did not bind MIS12C ∆ Head2 , regardless of its phosphorylation status ( Figure 6G ) . CENP - C binds MIS12C also through the a 1 - helix downstream from the arginine - rich motif ( Figure 6B ) . A segment with helical propensity around residues 238 - 245 of CENP - T can be tentatively aligned to the CENP - C a 1 helix ( Figure 6F ) . Collectively , these results suggest that residues 213 - 249 of CENP - T bind MIS12C similarly to residues 14 - 48 of CENP - C , as modelled in Figure 7A - B . Phosphorylation of the CENP - T 184 - 215 peptide on Ser201 ( Figure 7C ) enhanced the binding affinity for MIS12C ∆ Head2 approximately 200 - fold ( Figure 7D and Table S1 ) . Chemical crosslinking coupled with mass spectrometry on the MIS12C : P - CENP - T 1 - 373 complex ( unpublished observations ) identified crosslinks between Ser201 CENP - T and Lys127 NSL1 or Lys103 MIS12 that allowed us to restrain the orientation of the CENP - T peptide on the Mis12C surface and model the ultimate path of the peptide ( residues 201 to 212 , Figure 7E - F ) . Lys127 NSL1 and Lys103 MIS12 are part of a positively charged , conserved surface ridge residing at the junction between the connector and Head1 , opposite to the CENP - C binding site , and also comprising Arg131 NSL1 and Lys132 NSL1 ( Figure 7E - G ) . Mutation of the latter two residues to alanine ( MIS12C NSL1 - RKAA ) reduced binding affinity for the P - CENP - T 184 - 215 peptide approximately 25 - fold ( Figure 7H and Table S1 ) , strongly implicating them in recognition of P - Ser201 CENP - T . This model of the interaction of CENP - T with MIS12C predicts that two additional residues , Lys139 NSL1 and Lys142 NSL1 , are well positioned to interact with P - Thr195 CENP - T ( Huis In ' t Veld et al . , 2016 ) . In the structure of the MIS12C : CENP - C complex , this ridge is not involved in CENP - C binding ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 ) . Accordingly , a CENP - C 1 - 21 peptide bound MIS12C WT and MIS12C NSL1 - RKAA with essentially identical affinity ( Figure 7I ) . Collectively , these data suggest that the CENP - T chain occupies a unique MIS12C ridge until it bends , around Pro211 and Pro212 , to interact with the previously identified CENP - C binding interface . This model of the CENP - T - MIS12C interaction predicts the observed competitive binding to MIS12C of CENP - C and CENP - T . Reconstitution of a complete kinetochore module Finally , we aimed to assemble a complete kinetochore module comprising all the inner and outer kinetochore subunits . To monitor the incorporation of NDC80C in the reconstituted particles , we used wild type CENP - T ( Figure 8A , construct 2 ) or a CENP - T mutant where the two direct NDC80C binding sites , Thr11 and Thr85 , were mutated to alanine ( construct 1 ) . We then incubated these constructs as baits on solid phase with excess NDC80C and MIS12C and CDK1 : Cyclin B ( Figure 8B ; the outcome of this experiment is presented schematically in Figure 7C and quantified in Figure 8D and Figure S7D ) . Without MIS12C , construct 1 bound only 14 background levels of NDC80C ( sample A ) . Addition of MIS12C ( sample B ) resulted in the binding of one equivalent of NDC80C . Construct 2 , on the other hand , bound approximately two equivalents of NDC80C in the absence of MIS12C ( sample C ) , and three equivalents when MIS12C was also added ( sample D ) . These stoichometries suggest that phosphorylation of CENP - T on Thr11 , Thr85 , and Ser201 is complete and leads to saturation of these binding site . To obtain complete kinetochore particles , we reconstituted three MBP CENP - C F baits with tandem CENP - A NCPs - H3 NCPs dinucleosomes built on two consecutive human a - satellite repeats , and further decorated them with a different complement of CCAN subunits ( particles 1 to 3 in Figure 8E ; see also Figure S7A - C ) . Particle 3 contained all the CCAN subunits and was additionally phosphorylated by CDK1 : Cyclin B . We first incubated the immobilized baits with KMN network ( generated with the MIS12 ∆ 10 mutant that binds maximally to CENP - C or CENP - T ) , and after washing the excess of unbound KMN we added an excess of free NDC80C . After further washing , we analyzed bound proteins by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining ( Figure 8F ) . CDK1 : Cyclin B phosphorylation was effective , because it caused large shifts in the mobility of MBP CENP - C F and CENP - T . We quantified band intensities of scanned gels to determine the apparent stoichiometries of outer kinetochore subunits . The intensity of KMN subunits in Particle 1 , whose only linkage to the KMN is through the MBP CENP - C F baits , were taken as reference to assess the effects of integrating CENP - T and other CCAN subunits . We then examined the intensities of KMN subunits in particle 3 and compared them with those in particle 1 . The ratio of particle 3 / particle 1 MIS12C subunits ( averaged over two subunits , DSN1 and PMF1 ) , was approximately 1 . 5 ( Figure 8G - H and Figure S7D - H ) , compatible with the addition of a single equivalent of CENP - T , if CENP - T remained fully saturated with MIS12C on the beads , as supported by the experiments in Figure 8B . Alternatively , the observations are compatible with the addition of two equivalents if CENP - T underwent partial dissociation from MIS12C during the experiment . On the other hand , the particle 3 / particle 1 ratio of NDC80C subunits ( also averaged over two subunits , NUF2 and SPC25 ) was higher than 3 , compatible with the addition of two equivalents of CENP - T with full saturation of the Thr11 and Thr85 sites and partial saturation of the KMN binding site ( Figure 8G - H and Figure S7D - H ) . Discussion We have reconstituted a particle incorporating all known core subunits of the human kinetochore , mostly in full length form ( Figure 9A ) . The outer kinetochore subunits assemble on this particle with stoichiometries approaching the calibrated fluorescence intensity measurements performed on entire human kinetochores ( Suzuki et al . , 2015 ) . CENP - TW , however , appeared to 15 be generally sub - stoichiometric in our reconstitutions , even in presence of nucleosomes , explaining why stoichiometries in our particles don’t yet reach the highest ratios of outer to inner kinetochore subunits observed at human kinetochores . Because the CENP - TW complex is one of the most deeply bound kinetochore components at the interface with centromeric chromatin ( Fachinetti et al . , 2013 ; Gascoigne et al . , 2011 ; Hori et al . , 2013 ; McKinley et al . , 2015 ; Suzuki et al . , 2014 ; Wan et al . , 2009 ) , failure to fully incorporate it in our reconstitutions suggests that an additional binding interface , not necessarily on DNA , may be missing . Characterization of the interaction of CENP - T with the Mis12 complex , on the other hand , brought to light striking similarities with the way that CENP - C interacts with this complex ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 ) , and offered a glimpse on the potential regulation of this interaction by Aurora B kinase . Recent single - particle cryo - electron microscopy ( EM ) structural analyses have illuminated the overall organization of the CCAN Ctf19 complex of Saccharamyces cerevisiae ( Hinshaw and Harrison , 2019 ; Yan et al . , 2019 ) , with insights into its “point” single kinetochore module . With the only known exception of kinetoplastids ( Akiyoshi and Gull , 2014 ) , eukaryotic kinetochores are evolutionarily related , despite considerable divergence in certain phyla , where loss of one or more CCAN subunits is not uncommon ( Drinnenberg and Akiyoshi , 2017 ; van Hooff et al . , 2017 ) . This seems to imply that regional kinetochores are built from multiple , adjacent repetitions of a module related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae ’s , and that the particle we have reconstituted is , or approaches , the human module . Structural analyses of kinetochores from additional species will have to clarify the extent to which CCAN complexes from other eukaryotes , including humans , resemble the yeast module . CENP - C is found at kinetochores of most species , likely because its roles in connecting the CENP - A nucleosome to the outer kinetochore and as an organizer of the CCAN complex are indispensable . The apparent co - linearity of binding motifs in CENP - C with the outer - inner kinetochore axis prompted us to define this protein as a blueprint for kinetochore assembly ( Klare et al . , 2015 ; Pentakota et al . , 2017 ; Screpanti et al . , 2011 ; Weir et al . , 2016 ) . To gain deeper insights into how CENP - C shapes the kinetochore - centromere interface , we harnessed a protein ligation technique ( Zakeri et al . , 2012 ) to obtain a full - length version of human CENP - C . Electroporated in cells acutely depleted of endogenous CENP - C , the fusion protein was functional , showcasing the power of electroporation for targeted protein delivery and functional studies with recombinant proteins in cells ( Alex et al . , 2019 ) . Our observation that CENP - C F binds selectively to CENP - A nucleosomes over H3 nucleosomes even at micromolecular concentrations in vitro was surprising , as previous studies had reported that at least the CENP - C motif , when isolated from the rest of CENP - C , binds relatively non - 16 selectively to CENP - A and H3 NCPs ( Ali - Ahmad et al . , 2019 ; Kato et al . , 2013 ) , although another study failed to detect an interaction of the CENP - C motif with H3 . 3 nucleosomes ( Arimura et al . , 2014 ) . Phosphorylation of CENP - C near the CENP - C motif has been recently shown to facilitate the interaction with CENP - A NCPs in vitro and CENP - C kinetochore localization ( Watanabe et al . , 2019 ) . The interaction of CENP - C with two nucleosomes , implied by the presence of CENP - A NCP - binding motifs in the central region and the CENP - C motifs , had been postulated ( Kato et al . , 2013 ; Musacchio and Desai , 2017 ) but remained undemonstrated . Here , we showed that CENP - C interacts with two disconnected CENP - A nucleosomes , or with a reconstituted di - nucleosome . In absence of CCAN proteins , this ability reflects having two CENP - A NCP - binding motifs , because mutation of both motifs abrogated binding of CENP - C to CENP - A NCPs in vitro , while mutation of either motif reduced the amount of bound CENP - A by half , suggesting that each binding site achieved saturation , at least at the low micromolar concentration of our experiments . Importantly , many CENP - C orthologues have only the CENP - C motif and no evident CENP - A binding motif in the central motif ( Kato et al . , 2013 ; Kral , 2015 ) . Even these CENP - C variants , however , may interact with two nucleosomes , because CENP - C interacts with CENP - A NCPs not only through its CENP - A binding motif ( s ) but also through CENP - N ( Figure 9B ) . Exemplifying this , addition of CENP - HIKM and CENP - LN complexes to CENP - A NCP binding - assays performed with impairing mutants of the CENP - A NCPs binding motifs of CENP - C rescued binding to CENP - A NCPs , while further mutation of the CENP - HIKM and CENP - LN binding sites largely abrogated binding in vitro and in cells . CENP - C localized quite robustly to centromeres after mutation or even deletion of both CENP - C motifs , as also reported in other studies ( Carroll et al . , 2010 ; Guo et al . , 2017 ; Watanabe et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , centromere recruitment of CENP - C relies not only on the CENP - A NCPs binding motifs , but equally , or even preferentially , on interactions with the CCAN . Studies of CENP - C localization in chicken DT40 cells have also demonstrated that recruitment of CENP - C requires CENP - HIKMLN and CENP - A nucleosome binding , but that the dependence on these interactions varies depending on the cell cycle phase ( Nagpal et al . , 2015 ; Watanabe et al . , 2019 ) . Rapid depletion of CENP - I or CENP - N in human DLD - 1 cells demonstrated a partial dependence of CENP - C on these proteins for kinetochore localization in interphase but not in mitosis ( McKinley et al . , 2015 ) . Other studies in human cells showed partially reduced levels of CENP - C when single CCAN components were depleted by RNAi ( Carroll et al . , 2009 ; Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ; Weir et al . , 2016 ) . Collectively , these analyses identify CENP - C as an organizer of centromeric chromatin and of the inner kinetochore . They also pinpoint that the cell cycle , likely through phosphorylation , influences the localization requirements of CENP - C ( Watanabe et al . , 2019 ) . 17 Regretfully , structural analyses on yeast Ctf19 CCAN have not yet visualized the Mif2p CENP - C polypeptide chain , either because it was not included in the reconstitution ( Hinshaw and Harrison , 2019 ) or because it was for the most part invisible in density maps ( Yan et al . , 2019 ) , a likely consequence of its predicted intrinsic disorder . An interesting potential implication of the modular organization of regional kinetochores is that each module , in isolation , may encode its epigenetic specification and propagation . If this were true , it might ultimately become possible to promote CENP - A loading in a reconstituted system provided that the loading machinery is offered the appropriate modular substrate . From a mechanistic perspective , however , how the organization of centromeric chromatin contributes to the recruitment there of specialized CENP - A loading machinery , including the CENP - A chaperone HJURP , the MIS18 : M18BP1 complex , and PLK1 kinase , and how CENP - A becomes loaded on chromatin by this machinery remains unclear ( Camahort et al . , 2007 ; Dunleavy et al . , 2007 ; Dunleavy et al . , 2009 ; Erhardt et al . , 2008 ; Foltz et al . , 2009 ; Fujita et al . , 2007 ; Hayashi et al . , 2004 ; Maddox et al . , 2007 ; McKinley and Cheeseman , 2014 ; Mizuguchi et al . , 2007 ; Sanchez - Pulido et al . , 2009 ; Stoler et al . , 2007 ) . Two features of CENP - A nucleosomes that must be considered in this context are 1 ) that once incorporated into centromeric chromatin , CENP - A is usually retained over extended , sometimes year - long periods of time ; and 2 ) that the levels of CENP - A at each chromosome appear to be maintained intergenerationally , implying that the amounts of newly loaded CENP - A are at least in first approximation identical to those of the centromere - residing CENP - A ( Bodor et al . , 2013 ; Falk et al . , 2015 ; Jansen et al . , 2007 ; Raychaudhuri et al . , 2012 ; Smoak et al . , 2016 ) . Suppression by cyclin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) limits loading to the early G1 phase of the cell cycle ( Jansen et al . , 2007 ; Pan et al . , 2017 ; Schuh et al . , 2007 ; Silva et al . , 2012 ) . The levels of CENP - A then halve during DNA replication , when CENP - A is equally distributed to the sister chromatids . New CENP - A loading is suppressed at this stage , and pre - replication levels of CENP - A are only re - established during the subsequent cell cycle . This contrasts with histone H3 . 1 deposition , which occurs along with DNA replication ( Mendiratta et al . , 2019 ) . Equal distribution of CENP - A to the sister chromatids during DNA replication engages HJURP , the same histone chaperone involved in CENP - A deposition , but the mechanistic basis of this process remains unclear ( Zasadzinska et al . , 2018 ) . Vacancies generated by halving CENP - A may be temporarily filled with the " placeholder " histone H3 . 3 , predicting that when CENP - A is loaded on chromatin in G1 , histone H3 . 3 is concomitantly evicted ( Dunleavy et al . , 2011 ) . Collectively , these features suggest a mechanism of CENP - A deposition in which a substrate of existing CENP - A nucleosomes determines how many new CENP - A nucleosomes are generated 18 at every cell cycle . We previously adapted this idea to hypothesize that a minimal unit of two adjacent nucleosomes , with an appropriate complement of CCAN subunits , may satisfy the requirements for a substrate - based CENP - A loading reaction ( Musacchio and Desai , 2017 ) . For instance , the placeholder hypothesis ( Dunleavy et al . , 2011 ) may be practically implemented on a di - nucleosome scaffold , with a CENP - A nucleosome persisting through the cell cycle and an adjacent nucleosome alternating in composition , with an H3 nucleosome between S - phase and G1 , and a CENP - A nucleosome between G1 and S - phase ( Musacchio and Desai , 2017 ) . While this remains merely conjectural , dimeric a - satellite units separated by a CENP - B box are a dominant feature of functional human centromeres ; CENP - A is greatly enriched in adjacent peaks centered on each a - satellite unit in the dimer , while CENP - T associates more prominently with the linker ( Henikoff et al . , 2015 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2014 ; Thakur and Henikoff , 2016 ; Yoda and Okazaki , 1997 ) . These considerations emphasize the importance of decoding the localization determinants of the CENP - A loading machinery that limits new CENP - A deposition to these sites , as the dissection of these determinants will reveal the molecular basis of epigenetic centromere specification . These determinants are probably complex and localized through the entire CCAN , because besides CENP - A itself , also CENP - C and CENP - I contribute to centromere recruitment of the Mis18 complex and M18BP1 ( Dambacher et al . , 2012 ; French and Straight , 2019 ; French et al . , 2017 ; Guse et al . , 2011 ; Hori et al . , 2017 ; Kral , 2015 ; Sandmann et al . , 2017 ; Shono et al . , 2015 ; Stellfox et al . , 2016 ) . All the work of in vitro reconstitution with CENP - A or Cse4 ( the S . cerevisiae ortholog of CENP - A ) , histone H4 , and the H2A / H2B dimer has so far uniformly converged on octameric , left - handed nucleosomes with somewhat looser DNA ends ( Black and Cleveland , 2011 ) . Importantly , human kinetochores can be reconstituted on , and bind selectively to , the octameric CENP - A NCPs , as shown here and elsewhere ( Weir et al . , 2016 ) , lending support to the idea that the left - handed octamer is the basic form of centromeric chromatin . CENP - A has been shown to form octameric nucleosomes also on centromeric chromatin in higher eukaryotes ( Black and Cleveland , 2011 ; Dunleavy et al . , 2013 ) , but a possible caveat is that extensive nuclease digestions of centromeric chromatin leads to dissociation of CCAN subunits that might trigger post - processing re - organization of CENP - A ( Ando et al . , 2002 ; Thakur and Henikoff , 2016 ) . In S . cerevisiae , the single kinetochore “module” is built on a specific , conserved centromere sequence ( Fitzgerald - Hayes et al . , 1982 ) , and protects ~ 125 bp of DNA from nuclease digestion , of which approximately 85 bp , sufficient for a single gyre of DNA , wrapped around a CENP - A core proposed to be forming a tetrasome ( Cole et al . , 2011 ; Henikoff and Furuyama , 2012 ; 19 Krassovsky et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , the DNA of yeast centromeres is positively supercoiled ( Diaz - Ingelmo et al . , 2015 ; Furuyama and Henikoff , 2009 ; Huang et al . , 2011 ) . The recent cryo - EM reconstruction of the Ctf19 CCAN : Cse4 NCPs complex ( Cse4 is the S . cerevisiae ortholog of CENP - A ) , however , did not capture these features , as it was obtained with an octameric , left - handed Cse4 NCP particle containing the 147 - bp Widom 601 DNA sequence ( Yan et al . , 2019 ) . In this structure , Chl4 CENP - N occupies a different position from that previously observed with the isolated CENP - N protein on reconstituted CENP - A NCPs ( Chittori et al . , 2018 ; Pentakota et al . , 2017 ; Tian et al . , 2018 ) , and that seems hardly compatible with the established function of human CENP - N in decoding the CENP - A L1 loop , where the sequences of CENP - A and H3 diverge ( Carroll et al . , 2010 ; Logsdon et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , a fully convincing case for an octameric , left - handed nucleosome in S . cerevisiae has not yet been made , and the hypothesis that at least in this organism centromeric chromatin adopts a different organization remains worth of further consideration . In view of the possible modularity of regional kinetochores discussed above and of the considerable conservation of the CCAN subunits , and despite the considerable evidence supporting octameric CENP - A nucleosomes , presence of related non - canonical features in other eukaryotes remains a concrete possibility . How non - canonical features of centromeric chromatin could be built and stabilized , however , remains enigmatic . Clearly , biochemical reconstitution can give the impulse required to solve this conundrum . A benchmark for successful reconstitution could be the reproduction of salient features of the original cellular object , including stoichiometries and successful binding interactions with the CENP - A loading machinery . Our future steps in biochemical reconstitutions will focus on this fundamental and still unresolved question . Acknowledgments We are grateful to Daniele Fachinetti and Don C .

The plasmid pETDuet1 - 6His - TEV - MBP was generated by subcloning the coding sequence of E . coli maltose binding protein with a N - terminal 6His - tag and a TEV protease cleavage site between Nco I and Sal I sites of pETDuet - 1 . A synthetic cDNA segment encoding human CENP - X isoform 1 , codon - optimized for expression in bacteria , was subcloned in pET28a using Xba I and Sal I . A cDNA segment encoding human CENP - S isoform 1 was subcloned into the second cassette of the same plasmid using Sal I and Not I . Codon - optimized cDNA of human CENP - C , CENP - T and CENP - W was purchased from GeneArt ( Life Technologies ) . The plasmids containing the SpyCatcher and SpyTag sequences were ordered from Addgene . The plasmid pETDuet - MBP - 8His was generated as previously described ( Pan et al . , 2017 ) . The PCR - amplified CDS of CENP - C - 601 - 943 or CENP - C - 721 - 943 was inserted between the N - terminal MBP - tag and the C - terminal 8His - Tag using Bam HI and 21 Xho I . The SpyTag sequence was inserted between the N - terminal MBP - tag and the CENP - C - 601 - 943 CDS using Bgl 2 and Bam HI . The PCR - amplified CDS of CENP - C - 1 - 600 was inserted after the N - terminal MBP - tag using Nhe I and Xho I . The PCR - amplified CDS of SpyCatcher was inserted using Kpn I and Sal I . In some constructs , MBP was exchanged against mCherry using Bgl 2 and Nhe I . All point mutations and sequence deletions were introduced by PCR - based site - directed mutagenesis . For the co - expression of EGFP - CENP - C and different mCherry - tagged Cupin constructs , the CDS encoding full - length human CENP - C and three different CDS encoding Cupin domains from human , S . cerevisiae and D . melanogaster were subcloned in pcDNA5 - EGFP - NLS - P2AT2A - mCherry - PTS1 ( Pan et al . , 2017 ) , a modified version of pcDNA5 - FRT / TO ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The CDS of NLS was exchanged against the CDS of human CENP - C - 1 - 943 using Bam HI and Xho I .

Purification of Cen1 - like DNA fragments for nucleosome reconstitution The pUC18 plasmids were transformed into competent E . coli cells . Inoculated bacteria cultures were incubated overnight at 37 °C in TB media supplemented with 100 µg / ml Ampicillin . Subsequently the plasmid DNA was purified using a Giga Purification Kit ( Macherey - Nagel ) . After EcoR V digestion the insert DNA was separated from the backbone DNA by PEG precipitation . The isolated DNA fragments were digested with BstX I / Bgl I ( DNA1 ) and Bgl I / Dra III ( DNA2 ) . The digested DNA fragments were loaded on a HiTrap Q FF anion exchange column ( GE Healthcare ) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 - 2000 mM NaCl in 20 bed volumes . Fractions containing the DNA fragments were precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 2 M NaCl . Reconstitution of nucleosomes CENP - A and H3 containing mononucleosomes assembled on ' 601 ' 145 - bp DNA were reconstituted precisely as described ( Weir et al . , 2016 ) . For the assembly 22 of dinucleosomes , CENP - A and H3 containing NCPs were first reconstituted using two different CEN1 - like DNA fragments . 1 µM of NCPs reconstituted on CEN1 - like DNA fragment 1 and CEN1 - like DNA fragment 2 were ligated to each other for 16 h at 4 °C using 8xHis - tagged T4 DNA ligase . The ligated NCPs were incubated with Complete nickel beads ( Roche ) for 7 h at 4°C to remove the T4 DNA ligase . The ligated dinucleosomes were concentrated , and glycerol was added at a final concentration of 2 % ( v / v ) . The mixture was loaded on a cylindrical gel containing 5 % reduced Bis - acrylamide . Native PAGE was carried out on a Mini Prep Cell apparatus ( Bio - Rad ) at 1 W constant power . Dinucleosomes were eluted at a constant flow rate of 0 . 1 mL / min overnight at 4°C into nucleosome buffer ( 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM triethanolamine ( TEA ) , 1 mM EDTA ) and collected in 250 µL fractions on 96 - well - plates . The OD260 and OD280 of the individual fractions were measured using a CLARIOstar Plus plater reader ( BMG Labtech ) . Fractions containing dinucleosomes were pooled , concentrated and stored at 4 °C . Human cell lines Parental Flp - In T - REx HeLa cells were a gift from S . Taylor ( University of Manchester , Manchester , England , UK ) . Flp - In T - REx DLD - 1 CENP - C - AID - EYFP cells were a generous gift from D . Fachinetti ( Institut Curie , Paris , France ) and Don C . Cleveland ( University of California , San Diego , USA ) . These cells have both alleles of CENP - C tagged at the C - Terminus with an Auxin - inducible degron ( AID ) - EYFP fusion ( Fachinetti et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , a gene encoding the plant E3 ubiquitin ligase osTIR1 was stably integrated into the genome of the cells . To induce rapid depletion of the endogenous CENP - C , 500 µ M of the synthetic auxin indole - 3 - acetic acid ( IAA ) was added to the cells . Cell culture For all cell culture experiments , cells were cultured in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM , PAN Biotech ) supplemented with 10 % tetracycline - free fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Thermo Fisher ) , 2 mM Pen / Strep ( PAN Biotech ) and 2 mM L - Glutamine ( PAN Biotech ) at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Expression of CENP - C - GFP fusion proteins was induced by addition of 50 ng / ml doxycycline ( Sigma Aldrich ) for at least 24 hours . CENP - C RNAi Gene expression of endogenous CENP - C was inhibited using a single siRNA ( target sequence : 5 ′ - GGAUCAUCUCAGAAUAGAA - 3 ′ obtained from Sigma - Aldrich ) , which targets the coding region of CENP - C mRNA . The expression of codon - optimized CENP - C rescue constructs was not affected by the siRNA treatment . 30 nM CENP - C siRNA was transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( ThermoFisher ) according to manufacturer ' s instructions . To induce the expression of GFP - tagged CENP - C rescue constructs , 50 ng / ml Doxycycline ( Sigma ) was added to the cells at the time of siRNA transfection . Phenotypes were analyzed 60 hours after transfection by immunofluorescence microscopy or immunoblotting analysis , respectively . 23 Generation of stable cell lines Stable Flp - In T - REx HeLa cell lines constitutively expressing various CENP - C constructs were generated by Flp / FRT recombination . Deletion mutants and point mutants of CENP - C were generated by PCR site - directed mutagenesis , and the sequences of all constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing ( Microsynth Seqlab ) . CENP - C constructs were cloned into a pcDNA5 / FRT plasmid and co - transfected with pOG44 ( Invitrogen ) , a plasmid expressing the Flp recombinase , into cells using X - tremeGENE ( Roche ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Following 2 weeks of selection in 250 µg ml − 1 Hygromycin B ( Thermo Fisher ) and 4 µg ml − 1 Blasticidin ( Thermo Fisher ) , single cell colonies were collected and subsequently expanded . Expression of the transgenes was checked by immunofluorescence microscopy and Western Blot analysis . Immunofluorescence microscopy The PFA - fixated cells were permeabilized with PBS - T ( PBS buffer containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) for 10 min and incubated with PBS - T containing 4 % BSA for 40 min . Cells were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with CREST / anti - centromere antibody ( Antibodies , Inc . ; dilution : 1 : 200 in PBS - T + 2 % BSA ) , washed three times with PBS - T and were subsequently treated for 30 min with anti - human Alexa 647 – conjugated secondary antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ; dilution : 1 : 200 in PBS - T + 2 % BSA ) to immunostain the centromeres . To visualize DNA , 0 . 5 µ g / ml DAPI ( Serva ) was added during the last washing step for 3 min . After drying , the coverslips were mounted with Mowiol mounting media ( EMD Millipore ) on glass slides and imaged using a × 60 oil immersion objective lens on a DeltaVision deconvolution microscope . The Deltavision Elite System ( GE Healthcare , UK ) is equipped with an IX - 71 inverted microscope ( Olympus , Japan ) , a PLAPON 60x / 1 . 42NA objective ( Olympus ) and a pco . edge sCMOS camera ( PCO - TECH Inc . , USA ) . Quantification of centromere signals was performed using the software Fiji with a script for semiautomated processing . Briefly , average projections were made from z - stacks of recorded images . Centromere spots were chosen based on the parameters of shape , size , and intensity using the images of the reference channel obtained with CREST - staining , and their positions were recorded . In the images of the data channels , the mean intensity value of adjacent pixels of a centromere spot was subtracted as background intensity from the mean intensity value of the centromere spot .

As secondary antibodies , we used anti - mouse or anti - rabbit ( 1 : 10 , 000 , Amersham , NXA931 , NA934 ) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase . After incubation with ECL western blotting reagent ( GE Healthcare ) , images were acquired with ChemiDocTM MP System ( BioRad ) using ImageLab 5 . 1 software . Electroporation of recombinant proteins into human cells To electroporate recombinant mCherry or mCherry - CENP - C protein into DLD - 1 - CENP - C - AID - EYFP cells and recombinant mCherry - CENP - W / Halo - CENP - T into HeLa cells , the Neon Transfection System Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) was used . 3 x 10 6 cells were trypsinized , washed with PBS and resuspended in electroporation Buffer R ( Thermo Fisher ) to a final volume of 90 µl . Recombinant mCherry - CENP - C and mCherry - CENP - W / Halo - CENP - T protein was diluted 1 : 2 in buffer R to 15 µM and 30 µl of the mixture was added to the 90 µl cell suspension . After mixing the sample , 100 µl of the mixture was loaded into a Neon Pipette Tip ( Thermo Fisher ) and electroporated by applying two consecutive 35 ms pulses with an amplitude of 1005 V . The sample was subsequently added to 50 ml of pre - warmed PBS , centrifuged at 500 g for 3 min and trypsinized for 7 min to remove non - internalized extracellular protein . After one additional PBS washing step and centrifugation , the cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM without antibiotics and transferred to a 12 - well plate containing poly - L - Lysine coated coverslips . After the electroporation procedure DLD - 1 - CENP - C - AID - EYFP cells were additionally treated with 500 µ M IAA ( Sigma ) to induce rapid depletion of endogenous CENP - C . Electroporated Halo - CENP - T was labelled using the Halo Tag Oregon Green fluorescent ligand ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Co - immunoprecipitation experiment Purified cleared lysates from HeLa Flp - In T - REx cells co - expressing EGFP - tagged CENP - C and mCherry - tagged Cupin fragments from human , S . cerevisiae and D . melanogaster were used for co - immunoprecipitation experiments . 4 mg lysate was incubated with 10 µl RFP - Trap magnetic agarose beads ( Chromotek ) for 3 h at 4 °C .

E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) - Codon - plus - RIL cells transfected with the pETDuet plasmid were grown in 2x YT medium supplemented with Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol at 37°C to an OD 600 of 0 . 8 . Then , 0 . 2 mM ITPG was added to induce protein expression and cells were cultured for 16 hr at 20 °C . Bacterial cells were harvested , washed once with PBS and the cell pellets were stored at - 20 °C . The proteins 6xHis - TEV - CENP - W / Halo - TEV - CENP - T and CENP - X / CENP - S were co - expressed by co - transformation of E . coli with two plasmids . To purify the CENP - C constructs , the bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 30 mM HEPES pH7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1mM TCEP ) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and subsequently lysed by sonication . The crude lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 75 . 000 g for 30 min at 4 °C . The supernatant was passed through a 0 . 45 µm filter ( Sarstedt ) and incubated with cOmplete His - Tag purification resin ( Roche ) for 16 hours on a tube roller ( Starlab ) at 4 °C . After incubation , the resin was washed with 100 ml lysis buffer A supplemented with 10 mM imidazole . The bound protein was finally eluted in 15 ml lysis buffer supplemented with 400 mM imidazole . The samples were concentrated using centrifugal filters with a 30 kDa mass cut - off ( Merck ) and were subsequently applied to a Superose 6 10 / 300 size - exclusion column ( GE healthcare ) equilibrated in SEC buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 % glycerol , 1 mM TCEP ) . SEC was performed under isocratic conditions at a constant flow rate of 0 . 5 ml / min . 500 µl fractions were collected and relevant fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , pooled , concentrated , flash - frozen and stored at - 80 °C until used for further experiments . Purification of mCherry - CENP - W / Halo - CENP - T - 8His and 6His - MBP - CENP - W / Halo - CENP - T was identical , but the Lysis buffer contained 1 M NaCl and the SEC buffer contained 500 mM NaCl and 5 % glycerol . To purify the CENP - TWSX tetramer , the bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 M NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 M EDTA , 5 mM 2 - Mercaptoethanol and 1 mM TCEP ) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF , lysed by sonication and cleared by centrifugation at 75 , 000 g at 4°C for 1 hour . The cleared lysate was applied to cOmplete His - Tag purification resin ( Roche ) , pre - equilibrated in lysis buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 6 h on a tube roller . Subsequently , the beads were washed with lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mM imidazole . Subsequently , the CENP - TWSX complex was eluted in lysis buffer supplemented with 400 mM imidazole . His - TEV protease was added and the CENP - TWSX complex was dialysed three times against 2 L of lysis buffer containing a reduced NaCl concentration of 300 mM .

Elution of mCherry - CENP - C was additionally monitored at 587 nm . 100 µ l fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS – PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . To detect complex formation of CENP - C and nucleosomes , the individual proteins were mixed at the indicated concentrations in a total volume of 50 µl , incubated for 30 minutes on ice and finally subjected to SEC . SpyTag reaction for in - vitro reconstitution of full - length CENP - C protein To reconstitute full - length CENP - C , the SpyTag reaction was used ( Zakeri et al . , 2012 ) . In brief , MBP - TEV - SpyTag - CENP - C 601 - 943 - 8xHis was incubated with TEV protease for 8 h at 4 °C to cleave off the N - Terminal MBP tag . Subsequently , 6xHis - TEV - MBP - CENP - C 1 - 600 - SpyCatcher was added in 3 - fold molar excess . After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h , the reconstituted MBP - CENP - C 1 - 600 - Spy - CENP - C 601 - 943 - 8xHis protein was separated from unligated protein fragments on a Superose 6 10 / 300 size - exclusion column ( GE Healthcare ) as described above . Relevant fractions were pooled and concentrated using 50 kDa cut - off Amicon filters . The concentrated protein was flash frozen and stored at - 80 °C . Analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation was performed in a Beckman XL - A ultracentrifuge at 42 , 000 rpm at 20 °C . CENP - A NCP ( alone and together with MBP - CENP - C FL WT or MBP - CENP - CDmotif2 ) and MBP - CENP - C - 721 - 943 were diluted in AUC buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 % glycerol , 1 mM TCEP ) and subsequently loaded into standard double - sector centerpieces . The cells were scanned at 260 nm or 280 nm . At least 150 scans were recorded for each sample . Data were analyzed using the program SEDFIT with the model of continuous c ( s ) distribution ( Schuck , 2000 ) . The partial 27 specific volumes of the proteins , buffer density , and buffer viscosity were estimated using the program SEDNTERP . For the DNA of CENP - A NCP , a partial specific volume of 0 . 55 ml / g was assumed . Figures were generated using the program GUSSI ( Brautigam , 2015 ) . In vitro phosphorylation by CDK1 : Cyclin B When indicated , samples were phosphorylated during the amylose - resin pull - down experiments using in - house generated CDK1 : Cyclin B : CAK1 ( CCC ) . Phosphorylation reactions were set up in binding buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , and 1 mM TCEP ) containing 100 nM CCC , 3 µ M CENP - T / CENP - C / CCAN substrate , 2 mM ATP , and 10 mM MgCl 2 . Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 120 min and then used in the pull - down experiments . Amylose - resin pull - down assay The amylose - resin pull - down assay was performed to check the binding of nucleosomes and kinetochore components to MBP - tagged CENP - C variants and MBP - tagged CENP - W / Halo - CENP - T variants . The proteins were diluted with binding buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 % glycerol and 1 mM TCEP ) to 3 µM concentration in a total volume of 50 µl and mixed with 20 µl amylose beads ( New England BioLabs ) . After mixing the proteins and the beads , 20 µl were taken as input . The rest of the solution was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a thermomixer ( Eppendorf ) set to 1000 rpm . To separate the proteins bound to the amylose beads from the unbound proteins , the samples were centrifuged at 800 g for 3 min at 4 °C . The supernatant was removed , and the beads were washed four times with 500 µl binding buffer . After the last washing step , 20 µl 2 x SDS - PAGE sample loading buffer was added to the dry beads . The samples were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and CBB staining . In assays performed to investigate the interactions of CENP - T to CCAN the buffer contained 150 mM NaCl , 15 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM TCEP and 0 . 01 % Tween20 . The samples were incubated for 15 min at 1 , 400 rpm and 4 °C . Binding measurements Fluorescence polarization experiments were performed with a CLARIOstar plus plate reader using Corning 384 well low volume black round bottom polystyrene NBS microplates . The experiment was performed in 20 µ l total reaction volume containing a fixed concentration ( 20 nM ) of the indicated 5 - FAM CENP - T or CENP - C peptide ( obtained from Genescript ) . Indicated peptides were mixed in a titration series with an increasing concentration of the respective MIS12C variant in the binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH8 , 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP ) , and equilibrated for 30 minutes before the measurement at approximately 25 C . Fluorecein ( 5 - FAM ) was exited with polarized light at 470 nm , and the emitted light was detected at 525 nm through both horizontal and vertical polarizers . Polarization values are shown as mean + - standard error for the mean for at least 3 replicates . The values of 28 the binding constants were derived through non - linear least square fitting procedure to a single - site binding model using the Origin software . Modeling Multiple sequence alignments were carried out using MAFFT ( Katoh et al . , 2019 ) . The degree of sequence conservation was calculated using ConSurf ( Ashkenazy et al . , 2016 ) and was mapped on the MIS12C structure . Human CENP - T residues 207 - 221 and 230 - 250 were modelled on the CENP - C peptide residues 6 - 22 and 28 - 48 according to the alignment shown in Figure 6C by fitting the residues into the electron density of the PDB ID code dataset 5LSK structure ( MIS12 complex with the CENP - C peptide ) using Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) . The side chains with different or insufficient density were modelled according to geometrical constraints . Atomic coordinates of the resulting model are available upon request . 29 References Akiyoshi , B . , and K . Gull . 2014 . Discovery of unconventional kinetochores in kinetoplastids .

Figure 9 Summary of main conclusions A ) The CENP - C dimer binds two nucleosomes ( both being represented as CENP - A nucleosomes here ) . For clarity , binding interactions are only shown for one of the two protomers in the CENP - C dimer . CENP - HIKM / - LN binds near the PEST region , where it attracts CENP - TW . One full KMN network is recruited through the N - terminal region of CENP - C . Another one is recruited through CENP - TW . The latter recruits two additional NDC80 complexes . Therefore , each CENP - C protomer is associated with two KMN network complexes , and a total of four NDC80 complexes . KNL11 was omitted for clarity . B ) CENP - C with ( top ) and without 43 ( bottom ) the CENP - A binding motif in the central region could nevertheless interact with two nucleosomes through the CENP - C motif and the CENP - HIKM / - LN complex . 943 2 601 A C 4°C 16 hours 1 943 Cupin domain PEST - rich region Central region 1 2 Mis12binding CENP - HIKM / - LN binding Dimerization Nucleosomebinding Hs CENP - C 1 - 943 1 1 Hs MBP CENP - C 1 - 600 - Spycatcher 943 2 Hs Spytag CENP - C 601 - 943 600 601 1 1 Hs MBP CENP - C F 600 B 79 % 27 % 86 % C E N P - C Y F P - A I D ( endogenou s ) m C he rr y C E N P - C F ( E l e c t r opo r . ) CR ES T D AP I M e r ge mCherry ( - IAA ) mCherry ( + IAA ) mCherry CENP - C F ( + IAA ) Metaphase plate congression Walstein et al .
