We studied the impacts of human 25 mobility on the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and 16 endemic viruses in Seattle over a 4 - year period , 2018 - 2022 . 26 Before 2020 , school - related foot traffic and large - scale population movements preceded seasonal outbreaks of 27 endemic viruses . Pathogen circulation dropped substantially after the initiation of stay - at - home orders in March 28 2020 . During this period , mobility was a positive , leading indicator of transmission of all endemic viruses and 29 lagged SARS - CoV - 2 activity . Mobility was briefly predictive of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission when restrictions 30 relaxed in summer 2020 but associations weakened in subsequent waves . The rebound of endemic viruses was 31 heterogeneously timed but exhibited stronger relationships with mobility than SARS - CoV - 2 . Mobility is most 32 predictive of respiratory virus transmission during periods of dramatic behavioral change , and , to a lesser extent , at 33 the beginning of epidemic waves . 34 Teaser : Human mobility patterns predict the transmission dynamics of common respiratory viruses in pre - and post - 35 pandemic years . 36 for use under a CC0 license .

Perofsky 2 Introduction 37 In early 2020 , there was widespread adoption of public health measures to slow the spread of severe acute 38 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) . A variety of non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) were 39 implemented in most countries to reduce contacts between infected and susceptible individuals , including shelter - in - 40 place or stay - at - home orders , gathering restrictions , school and business closures , and travel bans . These 41 interventions were effective at reducing not only SARS - CoV - 2 transmission but also the spread of other directly 42 transmitted respiratory pathogens ( 1 - 9 ) . Many endemic respiratory viruses did not return to widespread circulation 43 until the end of 2020 or 2021 ( 3 , 8 - 10 ) , coinciding with the gradual lifting of social distancing measures and mask 44 mandates . 45 During the COVID - 19 pandemic , aggregated location data from mobile phones became an important source of 46 information on changes in population - level movements and were used to model SARS - CoV - 2 dynamics and assess 47 the effectiveness of NPIs on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ( 11 - 13 ) . However , few studies have explored relationships 48 between human mobility and the dynamics of endemic respiratory pathogens during the pandemic . Here we define 49 " endemic” pathogens as those that have regular periodic cycles and stable rates of infection in outbreak periods . Due 50 to lack of circulation of endemic respiratory viruses in the first years of the pandemic , population susceptibility to 51 these pathogens is expected to have increased , leading to earlier , larger , or more severe epidemics a few months later 52 ( 14 , 15 ) . Understanding the influence of mobility patterns on the dynamics of endemic pathogens is important for 53 predictive purposes , especially as perturbed circulation can lead to overlapping epidemics of different pathogens and 54 in turn put extreme pressure on the healthcare system ( e . g . , the US “tripledemic” during winter 2022 - 2023 ) ( 16 ) . 55 Here , we leverage fine - grained respiratory surveillance data and mobile device location data to explore links 56 between population behavior and the transmission of 17 common respiratory viruses in the greater Seattle , 57 Washington region over a 4 - year period , 2018 – 2022 . These viruses include SARS - CoV - 2 , influenza viruses 58 ( A / H3N2 , A / H1N1 , and B ) , respiratory syncytial viruses ( RSV A and B ) , seasonal coronaviruses ( hCoV 229E , 59 OC43 , HKU1 , and NL63 ) , human metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) , human parainfluenza viruses ( hPIV 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , 60 human rhinovirus ( hRV ) , and adenovirus ( AdV ) . 61 Results 62 Study overview 63 We use detailed individual - level surveillance data from the Seattle Flu Study ( SFS ) , which launched in the Fall of 64 2018 to improve detection and control of epidemics and pandemics ( 17 ) . SFS carried out intensive hospital and 65 community - based surveillance with systematic molecular testing of nasal swabs for up to 26 respiratory pathogens 66 ( 17 ) ( Table S1 ) . Our study spans November 19 , 2018 , to June 30 , 2022 , during which respiratory specimens were 67 collected from individuals with and without respiratory illness across a variety of sites throughout the Seattle 68 metropolitan region , as previously described ( 17 - 23 ) . In total , 138 , 060 respiratory specimens were screened for the 69 presence of 24 or 26 pathogens ( Table S1 ) , and we retained 80 , 846 specimens after limiting our analysis to 70 symptomatic individuals and discarding samples with missing metadata or from multiple testing ( Table 1 , Table S2 ) . 71 25 . 3 % ( N = 20 , 640 ) of samples were collected in hospitals , and 74 . 5 % ( N = 60 , 206 ) were collected through 72 community - based testing , including outpatient clinics , kiosks stationed in high foot traffic areas ( 17 ) , swab - and - send 73 at - home testing programs ( 20 , 22 ) , and King County COVID - 19 drive through testing sites ( Table 1 , Table S2 ) . The 74 majority of hospital residuals were collected from younger age groups , while most community - based samples were 75 collected from adults ( Table 1 , Figure S1 , Table S2 ) . 76 for use under a CC0 license .

Over the course of the four - year study , 40 . 6 % ( N = 32 , 841 ) of specimens tested positive for at least one respiratory 81 pathogen ( including SARS - CoV - 2 ) , 32 . 4 % ( N = 26 , 182 ) were positive for at least one endemic respiratory 82 pathogen , and 9 . 1 % ( N = 7 , 374 ) were positive for more than one pathogen . Prior to the start of Washington’s 83 COVID - 19 restrictions in March 2020 , the most prevalent pathogens among positive samples were influenza 84 A / H1N1 virus ( 17 . 9 % ) , followed by hRV ( 15 . 4 % ) , influenza A / H3N2 virus ( 13 . 9 % ) , influenza B virus ( 12 . 2 % ) , and 85 RSV A ( 9 . 7 % ) ( Figure S2 ) . After March 2020 , the most prevalent pathogens were SARS - CoV - 2 ( 39 . 5 % ) , hRV 86 ( 35 . 4 % ) , and AdV ( 5 . 1 % ) ( Figure S2 ) . 87 We reconstructed daily incidences for SARS - CoV - 2 and each endemic pathogen , adjusting for testing volume over 88 time , age , clinical setting , and local syndromic respiratory illness rates ( Figure S3 ) . Although SFS tested respiratory 89 specimens for up to 26 pathogens , we limited our analysis to 17 viruses with sufficient sampling ( ≥ 400 positive 90 samples during 2018 - 2022 ) , including SARS - CoV - 2 , influenza A / H1N1 , A / H3N2 , and B viruses , RSV A and B , 91 hCoV 229E , OC43 , HKU1 , and NL63 , hPIV 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , hMPV , hRV , and AdV ( Figure 1 , Figure S3 ) . Due to 92 laboratory assay limitations ( Table S1 ) , we grouped epidemiologically distinct strains into one incidence time series 93 each for hCoV 229E and hCoV OC43 ( hereon hCoV 229E + OC43 ) , hCoV HKU1 and hCoV NL63 ( hCoV HKU1 + 94 NL63 ) , hPIV 1 and hPIV 2 ( hPIV 1 + 2 ) , hPIV 3 and hPIV 4 ( hPIV 3 + 4 ) , hRV , and AdV . hPIV 3 likely comprises 95 most of hPIV 3 + 4 incidence because hPIV 4 infections are detected infrequently and tend to be mild or 96 asymptomatic ( 24 ) . 97 Based on reconstructed incidences , we used semi - mechanistic epidemiological models to measure the time - varying 98 intensity of transmission via the daily effective reproduction number ( Rt ) ( 25 , 26 ) ( Figure 1 ) . To generate Rt based 99 on dates of infection , we convolved over uncertain incubation periods and reporting delay distributions ( i . e . , delays 100 from symptom onset to testing ) , wherein delays were informed by our individual - level surveillance data . We used 101 aggregated mobile device location data from SafeGraph and Meta Data for Good to assess the effects of population - 102 level movements on citywide respiratory virus dynamics in pre - and post - pandemic years ( Figures 2 - 3 ) . During the 103 pandemic period , we also considered the effects of non - mobility behavioral indicators , including the stringency of 104 for use under a CC0 license .

This season was atypical in that Seattle experienced unusually high 144 snowfall during February 2019 , prompting widespread school and workplace closures and reduced regional travel 145 from February 3 to February 15 , 2019 . The mobility categories most impacted by the snowstorm included foot 146 traffic to elementary and high schools , colleges , and transit stations ( > 75 % declines below baseline ) , the inflow of 147 out - of - state visitors ( > 50 % declines below baseline ) , and within - and between - neighborhood movement ( 29 % and 148 15 % declines below baseline ) ( Figure 2 , Figure S4 ) . As previously described ( 21 ) , this city - wide shutdown led to a 149 conspicuous dip in incidence for several pathogens ( Figure S5 ) . 150 To measure the overall impact of the snowstorm on virus circulation , we compared pathogen specific Rt values 151 during the two weeks before and after the start of heavy snowfall on February 3 , 2019 ( Table 2 ) . RSV and AdV 152 were the pathogens most affected by weather - related disruptions ( 37 - 40 % declines ) , followed by influenza viruses 153 and hCoV ( 10 - 20 % declines , Table 2 ) . Influenza A / H3N2 virus , hPIV 3 + 4 , hMPV , hRV , and AdV rebounded after 154 schools and workplaces reopened , and their epidemics subsequently peaked from mid - March to early April 2019 155 ( Figure S5 ) . 156 During February 2019 , reductions in mobility preceded or coincided with declines in pathogen transmission , though 157 the strength of correlations varied across pathogens ( Figure S6 - S7 ) . Among pathogens with the most substantial 158 declines , drops in RSV Rt coincided most closely with reductions in within - city connectivity and foot traffic to 159 schools , child daycare centers , and religious services ( February 2019 mean cross - correlation coefficients , r > 0 . 86 ; 160 for use under a CC0 license .

For pathogens that did not experience declines 163 in transmission ( hPIV 3 + 4 , hMPV , hRV ) , Rt had negative or non - significant associations with mobility during the 164 snowstorm ( Figure S6 - S7 ) . 165 Table 2 .

During Fall 2019 , visits to child daycares , schools , colleges , and religious 174 organizations preceded or coincided with initial increases in influenza viruses , RSV , hMPV , hCoV , and hPIV 3 + 4 175 ( moving window cross - correlation coefficients , r range : 0 . 53 – 0 . 97 ; all reported correlations are statistically 176 significant ; Figure 4 , Figure S8 ) . The transmission rates of RSV , hCoV , and hPIV 3 + 4 were also positively 177 correlated with the percentage of devices leaving home ( r : 0 . 68 – 0 . 81 ) ( Figure 4 , Figure S8 ) . Increases in hPIV 1 + 178 2 and AdV Rt coincided with visits to child daycares ( both viruses , r : 0 . 63 – 0 . 88 ) , between - neighborhood 179 movement ( AdV , r : 0 . 6 – 0 . 8 ) , or out - of - state inflow ( hPIV 1 + 2 , r : 0 . 7 – 0 . 77 ) , while hRV dynamics were not 180 strongly tied to population mobility ( Figure 4 , Figure S8 ) . For most pathogens , the strongest relationships between 181 transmission and mobility occurred at the beginning of the season in early autumn ( Figure 4 , Figure S8 ) . 182 We used multivariable generalized additive models ( GAMs ) to measure non - linear relationships between mobility 183 and Rt and model selection of GAMs to assess the relative importance of different indicators in predicting Rt during 184 the 2019 - 2020 season , prior to the start of the COVID - 19 pandemic ( September 2019 – January 2020 ) . For each 185 pathogen , we allowed candidate models to include a smoothed temporal trend and up to two smoothed mobility 186 terms . Across all pathogens , minimal models included a school - related behavioral indicator ( foot traffic to schools 187 or colleges ) or the percentage of devices leaving home and a covariate related to large - scale population movement 188 ( between - neighborhood movement or out - of - state inflow ) , with the partial effects of most mobility covariates 189 monotonically increasing with Rt ( Figure S9 ) . 190 for use under a CC0 license .

Points are individual mobility indicators derived from aggregated mobile device location data . 194 Correlation coefficients are shown on the y - axis , and temporal lags ( in weeks ) between Rt and mobility are shown 195 on the x - axis . Negative lags indicate behavior leads Rt , and positive lags indicate Rt leads behavior . The yellow 196 shaded panel in each facet includes mobility indicators that have a leading , positive relationship with transmission , 197 and hence would be considered predictive of transmission . 198 Initial effects of COVID - 19 restrictions on mobility and respiratory virus circulation 199 The first SARS - CoV - 2 infections in Washington state arose from a single introduction in late January or early 200 February 2020 , and at least one clade was circulating in the Seattle area for 3 - 6 weeks prior to February 28 , when 201 the first community acquired case was reported ( 18 ) . To slow the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 , Washington declared a 202 State of Emergency on February 29 , closed schools in King , Pierce , and Snohomish counties on March 12 , and 203 enacted statewide stay - at - home ( SAH ) orders on March 23 . In the interim , King County recommended that 204 workplaces allow employees to work from home on March 4 and closed indoor dining and many other businesses on 205 March 16 . 206 Mobility levels declined substantially after February 29 , and , by the start of King County’s business closures on 207 March 16 , foot traffic to transit stations were > 90 % below baseline and out - of - state inflow and within - city mixing 208 were > 60 % below baseline ( Figure 2 , Figure S4 ) . After the enactment of SAH orders on March 23 , foot traffic to 209 POIs and large - scale movements declined to 70 - 90 % below baseline ( Figure 2 , Figure S4 ) , while the percentage of 210 devices staying completely at home increased to > 50 % ( Figure 2 ) . Notably , social distancing measures altered not 211 only the volume of movement between Seattle neighborhoods but also the presence and absence of connections 212 between neighborhoods . Specifically , neighborhoods with low degree centrality ( i . e . , fewer than 10 connections to 213 other neighborhoods ) became much more prevalent compared to weeks prior to March 2020 ( Figure 3 ) . 214 for use under a CC0 license .

We measured the initial 216 impacts of COVID - 19 NPIs on respiratory virus circulation by comparing Rt values during the 2 weeks before and 217 after the State of Emergency declaration on February 29 ( Table 2 ) . Early public health measures were effective at 218 lowering SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rates by 37 % [ 95 % CI : 25 , 51 ] . Among endemic pathogens , influenza A / H1N1 219 virus , AdV , and hRV were the most impacted by pandemic - related behavioral changes , experiencing 29 – 42 % 220 reductions in transmissibility by March 16 . hPIV 3 + 4 , hMPV , and hCoV were also significantly affected , 221 experiencing 20 – 25 % declines in Rt . Reductions in RSV and influenza B virus were more modest , given their 222 seasonal outbreaks had mostly concluded by late February . The hPIV 1 + 2 outbreak subsided in mid - February , and 223 thus was not impacted by COVID - 19 NPIs . 224 We observed strong relationships between mobility and the transmission of respiratory pathogens in the Spring of 225 2020 . All mobility metrics were positive , leading indicators of Rt across all endemic viruses ( Figure 4 , Figure S10 ) . 226 In contrast , mobility lagged and was negatively correlated with SARS - CoV - 2 transmission during this period 227 ( Figure 4 , Figure S10 ) . COVID - 19 restrictions began to relax on May 4 , 2020 , when King County entered Phase 1 228 of the state’s reopening plan , allowing outdoor dining , worship services , and fitness centers to reopen with limited 229 capacity . SARS - CoV - 2 Rt values ranged from 0 . 8 to 0 . 9 throughout April and May and did not surpass 1 until late 230 May ( Figure 1 ) . During late April and May , SARS - CoV - 2 Rt became positively correlated and synchronous with 231 most mobility indicators ( r : 0 . 66 – 0 . 97 ) and inversely correlated with the stringency of NPIs ( r : - 0 . 97 – - 0 . 81 ) 232 ( Figure 4 , Figure S10 ) . Yet , these relationships did not persist after the virus’s initial rebound in early June 2020 , 233 when King County reopened indoor dining and additional businesses ( Figure S10 ) . Due to the high degree of 234 collinearity and concurvity among mobility metrics , we could not differentiate the effects of individual indicators on 235 Rt during Seattle’s SAH period . 236 Population mobility did not immediately recover after SAH orders lifted in June 2020 ( Figures 2 - 3 , Figure S4 ) . 237 Visitor inflow from other WA counties and US states remained depressed at levels 50 % below baseline until the 238 spring and summer months of 2021 , and within - and - between - neighborhood movement had not returned to pre - 239 pandemic levels by the conclusion of our study in June 2022 ( Figures 2 - 3 , Figure S4 ) . Further , SAH orders caused 240 long - lasting structural changes to the mobility network of Seattle , wherein neighborhoods with high degree 241 centrality ( “hubs” ) were most affected ( Figure 3 ) . After March 2020 , neighborhoods with fewer than 10 connections 242 to other neighborhoods became much more prevalent in the network , causing an overall downshift in the mobility 243 network’s median degree for the remainder of the study period ( Figure 3 ) . 244 Associations between SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and behavior differ across COVID - 19 waves 245 We measured cross - correlations between SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , mobility , masking , and NPI stringency during 246 subsequent pandemic waves in Seattle ( Figure 5 ) . After its first two COVID - 19 outbreaks in Spring 2020 and 247 Summer 2020 , Seattle experienced a large third wave during winter 2020 - 2021 despite high masking rates ( Figure 248 5 ) . During November - December 2020 , daily Rt was strongly correlated with foot traffic to restaurants ( r : 0 . 65 – 249 0 . 83 ) , the percentage of devices leaving home ( r : 0 . 7 – 0 . 83 ) , the influx of visitors from other WA counties and US 250 states ( r : 0 . 66 – 0 . 74 ) , and NPI stringency ( r : - 0 . 85 – - 0 . 76 ) ( Figure 5 ) . A smaller wave associated with the Alpha 251 variant spanned March to May 2021 , during which Rt was not significantly associated with mobility ( Figure 5 ) . 252 COVID - 19 cases and hospitalizations surged again in July 2021 , due to the spread of the highly transmissible Delta 253 variant . From late June to early August 2021 , the percentage of residents not masking in public , the percentage of 254 devices leaving home , and visitor inflow preceded or coincided with increases in Rt ( r : 0 . 75 – 0 . 94 ) ( Figure 5 ) . 255 Transmission decoupled from behavior during the Omicron BA . 1 wave in late 2021 , wherein SARS - CoV - 2 Rt was 256 negatively correlated and lagging most mobility metrics and positively correlated with masking and NPI stringency 257 ( the inverse of expected relationships ) ( Figure 5 ) . Minimal GAMs fit to the first three months of each wave retained 258 the percentage of devices leaving home , the percentage of residents not masking , foot traffic to restaurants , or out - 259 of - state inflow ( Figure S11 ) , but associations between behavior and Rt were often negative . 260 for use under a CC0 license .

Increases in hRV transmission were preceded by or synchronous with the 277 percentage of devices leaving home , foot traffic to restaurants , between - neighborhood movement , and visitor inflow 278 from June to early August 2020 ( r : 0 . 75 – 0 . 96 ) , inversely correlated with NPI stringency during September 2020 ( r : 279 - 0 . 79 – - 0 . 69 ) , and continuously correlated with foot traffic to religious organizations until late 2020 ( r : 0 . 64 – 0 . 91 ) 280 ( Figure S12 ) . The rebound of AdV was preceded by or synchronous with slight increases in foot traffic to schools 281 and religious organizations from June to early August 2020 ( r : 0 . 7 – 0 . 87 ) ( Figure S12 ) . For both viruses , minimal 282 GAMs fit to the first six months of rebound retained the percentage of devices leaving home and out - of - state inflow 283 ( Figure S13 ) . 284 Resurgence of other endemic viruses , including hCoV , hPIV , hMPV , and RSV B , was not observed until early - to - 285 mid 2021 , and epidemic peaks for hCoV , hMPV , and RSV B occurred during the spring or summer outside of their 286 typical seasons ( Figure 1 , Figures S2 - S3 ) . We measured univariate associations between mobility , masking , NPI 287 stringency , and daily transmissibility and found fewer clear relationships compared to Seattle’s SAH period and the 288 2019 - 2020 winter season . Multiple mobility indicators preceded or coincided with the rebound of these viruses , 289 though , for RSV B and hCoV , associations were briefer compared to those observed during seasonal outbreaks prior 290 to the pandemic ( Figure S14 ) . For example , at the beginning of RSV B’s rebound in summer 2021 , increases in Rt 291 were preceded by between - neighborhood movement and foot traffic to schools , child daycares , and religious 292 organizations ( r : 0 . 7 – 0 . 9 ) and synchronous with the percentage of devices leaving home , the percentage of 293 residents not masking in public , and out - of - state inflow ( r : 0 . 7 – 0 . 91 ) ( Figure S14 ) . These associations were more 294 transient compared to the pre - pandemic period , persisting for 1 - 2 months instead of 2 - 3 months ( Figures S8 and 295 S14 ) . Minimal GAMs fit to the first three months of each virus’s rebound retained between - neighborhood 296 movement and out - of - state inflow , though relationships between mobility and Rt were nonlinear and not 297 consistently positive ( Figure S15 ) . 298 In late 2021 , endemic virus circulation declined as Omicron cases surged , and reductions in endemic virus 299 transmission were universally preceded by or coincided with drops in mobility ( Figure S12 , Figure S14 , Figure 300 S16 ) . For example , reductions in most mobility indicators preceded declines in RSV B , hMPV , hCoV , and hPIV 3 + 301 4 circulation by 1 to 4 weeks , while reduced visits to child daycares , schools , colleges , and transit stations were 302 synchronous with declines in hRV transmission ( Figures S12 , Figure S14 ) . The transmission rates of RSV B , 303 hMPV , and hCoV were also associated with the percentage of devices staying home , which spiked from 35 % to 304 50 % in December 2021 ( Figure 2 , Figure S16 ) . During the Omicron wave ( November 2021 – January 2022 ) , the 305 best fit minimal GAMs for each virus retained a school - related behavioral indicator , the percentage of devices 306 leaving home , or out - of - state inflow , similar to results observed for the 2019 - 2020 season ( Figure S17 ) . 307 Although our study’s aim was inferential rather than predictive , we built forecasting models of daily Rt for three 308 viruses that circulated continuously throughout the study period : hRV , AdV , and SARS - CoV - 2 . We used mobility 309 metrics , the co - circulation of other viruses , and activity of the target virus during the previous two weeks ( 14 310 autoregressive terms ) as candidate predictors . For each virus , models with only mobility terms did not outperform 311 models with only autoregressive terms ( Figures S18 - S20 ) but still produced accurate forecasts over the entire study 312 period ( Pearson’s r with observed data , r > 0 . 8 ) , and especially during Seattle’s stay - at - home orders and the initial 313 lifting of restrictions ( r : 0 . 94 – 0 . 95 ) ( Table S3 ) . Methodological details and results are provided in the 314 supplementary material . 315 Discussion 316 We investigated the impacts of human behavior on the transmission of respiratory viruses in the greater Seattle 317 region , during pre - and post - pandemic years , by modeling incidence derived from hospital and community - based 318 respiratory surveillance and human movements from high - resolution mobile device location data . From November 319 2018 to June 2022 , we characterized the epidemiological dynamics of 16 endemic viruses and SARS - CoV - 2 and 320 related changes in daily transmissibility ( time - varying effective reproduction numbers , Rt ) to trends in population 321 mobility , masking , and COVID - 19 non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) . To our knowledge , this is the first 322 study to explore the effects of mobility and behavior on transmission across a large set of endemic pathogens ; 323 for use under a CC0 license .

Smaller - scale changes in mobility also preceded or coincided 327 with increases in Rt at the beginning of outbreaks and declines in Rt during shorter interruptions to human 328 movement , as observed during a major snowstorm in February 2019 and the Omicron BA . 1 wave in late 2021 . 329 Across all endemic viruses , trends in daily Rt were repeatedly associated with the same set of mobility metrics , 330 including foot traffic to elementary and high schools , colleges , child daycare centers , restaurants , and religious 331 organizations , the percentage of devices leaving home , between - neighborhood movement , and the inflow of visitors 332 from other WA counties and US states . Outside the SAH period , SARS - CoV - 2 transmission correlated with foot 333 traffic to restaurants and colleges , the percentage of devices leaving home , and visitor inflow . Foot traffic to specific 334 businesses and educational and religious activities may approximate close contacts or crowded conditions that 335 facilitate direct , aerosol , or droplet transmission , while the percentage of devices leaving home , within - city mixing , 336 and inflow from other regions may be indicative of human movements that promote viral introductions and 337 dispersal . 338 The age distribution of infections may explain slight differences in which categories of POIs correlated with 339 endemic virus transmission versus SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Recurrent associations between endemic virus Rt and 340 visits to schools and daycares are consistent with children experiencing the highest rates of ( endemic ) respiratory 341 infections and schools and daycares acting as a major source of transmission in the community ( 29 - 33 ) . Unlike 342 endemic respiratory viruses , all age groups are susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Correlations between SARS - 343 CoV - 2 Rt and foot traffic to colleges and restaurants , but not schools or daycares , could be attributed to greater rates 344 of symptomatic infection ( and hence shedding propensity ) in adults relative to younger age groups ( 34 ) or to the 345 greater relevance of adult networks in spreading SARS - CoV - 2 compared to endemic viruses . 346 COVID - 19 NPIs significantly perturbed the transmission of respiratory pathogens at a global level ( 1 - 8 ) , causing the 347 complete disappearance , delayed return , or “off - season” outbreaks of endemic pathogens ( 6 - 9 ) . In Seattle , all 348 endemic respiratory viruses experienced rapid declines at the beginning of Seattle’s SAH orders in March 2020 , but , 349 as restrictions eased , their rebound was heterogeneous . Similar to trends observed in the US and other countries ( 4 , 350 6 , 7 , 10 , 35 - 39 ) , the circulation of hRV and AdV resumed in early June 2020 , immediately after nonessential 351 businesses and indoor dining reopened , while other respiratory viruses virtually disappeared during March 2020 and 352 did not recirculate until 2021 . Further , the resurgence of RSV B , hCoV , and hMPV occurred outside of their typical 353 seasons , as reported in other locations ( 7 - 9 ) . After the initial easing of COVID - 19 restrictions , relationships between 354 endemic virus dynamics and mobility were less clear compared to Seattle’s SAH orders or the 2019 - 2020 winter 355 season , potentially due to continued social distancing and masking , a more refined understanding of “high risk” 356 activities , the delay of in - person instruction for school students until spring 2021 , or structural changes to Seattle’s 357 mobility network . Nonetheless , associations between endemic virus Rt and population behavior were overall 358 stronger and longer - lasting than those observed for SARS - CoV - 2 . 359 It is remarkable that the two viruses that rebounded immediately after lockdown restrictions lifted , hRV and AdV , 360 are non - enveloped viruses , while the other viruses studied here are enveloped . The immediate rebound of non - 361 enveloped viruses could be attributed to viral stability and persistence . Non - enveloped viruses are less susceptible to 362 lipophilic disinfection and can persist on hands and fomites for longer periods of time than enveloped viruses ( 40 , 363 41 ) . In addition of the presence or absence of an envelope , several other factors , such as transmission mode , 364 seasonality , source / sink dynamics , and duration of infectious period and immunity , could have affected the timing of 365 rebound . While enveloped viruses disappeared in March 2020 , non - enveloped viruses may have continued to spread 366 during SAH restrictions , due to their longer periods of viral shedding , high preexisting community prevalence , or 367 ability to persist on environmental surfaces ( 36 , 40 - 42 ) . We hypothesize that low levels of transmission or residual 368 viral particles on surfaces , combined with slight increases in movement , close contacts , and visitor inflow , were 369 sufficient to facilitate the rapid rebound and ongoing transmission of hRV and AdV after SAH orders lifted in June 370 2020 . Further , surgical masks are less effective at filtering hRV compared to influenza viruses and seasonal 371 coronaviruses ( 43 ) . 372 Our study period encompasses the two respiratory virus seasons prior to the start of the COVID - 19 pandemic and 373 two pandemic years . The Seattle Flu Study ( SFS ) began collecting samples in November 2018 , which precluded us 374 for use under a CC0 license . This article is a US Government work .

However , we 375 were able to detect strong links between mobility and transmission in February 2019 when a major snowstorm 376 forced work and school closures , consistent with previous SFS research that did not specifically examine cell phone 377 mobility patterns ( 21 ) . SFS continued to collect respiratory samples throughout 2019 , enabling us to test for leading 378 indicators of transmission during the 2019 - 2020 winter season . During Fall 2019 , the transmission dynamics of 379 enveloped viruses were more strongly correlated with mobility than those of non - enveloped viruses . For enveloped 380 viruses , foot traffic to schools and colleges , between - neighborhood movement , and visitor inflow preceded or 381 coincided with increases in transmission , with associations between Rt and mobility weakening over the course of 382 the season , presumably due to accumulating immunity in the population . During this same period , non - enveloped 383 viruses had fewer positive relationships with mobility , potentially because hRV and AdV circulate year - round and 384 have less defined peaks and troughs . 385 SARS - CoV - 2 began circulating in the greater Seattle region during January or February 2020 ( 18 ) , with the first 386 community - acquired case confirmed on February 28 , 2020 . Mobility had a negative , lagging relationship with 387 SARS - CoV - 2 Rt during the early months of 2020 , suggesting that Seattle residents adjusted their behavior in 388 response to COVID - 19 case counts or restrictions rather than the reverse . Mobility was briefly predictive of SARS - 389 CoV - 2 transmission when social distancing restrictions first relaxed in summer 2020 and during the winter 2020 - 390 2021 and Delta waves , before ultimately decoupling from Rt during the Omicron BA . 1 wave in late 2021 . 391 Compared to prior variants of concern ( VOCs ) , Omicron BA . 1 has a shorter serial interval , increased immune 392 evasion , and greater intrinsic transmissibility ( 44 - 46 ) . A phylogeographic study linked inter - city travel to the spatial 393 spread of individual Omicron BA . 1 lineages in the UK ( 47 ) , suggesting that daily Rt estimated from all COVID - 19 394 cases combined may lack the resolution to relate the rapid spread of Omicron BA . 1 to mobility patterns ( see 395 methods for comments on VOC - specific Rt analyses ) . 396 Climate affects the stability and seasonal dynamics of respiratory viruses ( 48 - 51 ) but was an unlikely driver of 397 endemic virus resurgence in Seattle . hRV and AdV have year - round circulation with peaks in the spring and early 398 autumn ( 52 , 53 ) , while influenza viruses , RSV , hCoV , hMPV , and hPIV have distinct seasonality with peaks during 399 the winter or spring ( 53 - 56 ) . The lifting of SAH orders in June 2020 coincided with the typical timing of low 400 circulation for enveloped viruses and increasing activity for non - enveloped viruses . However , the intersection of 401 relaxing NPIs with warmer weather cannot account for the global differences observed between non - enveloped and 402 enveloped virus rebound . The prolonged absence of influenza and RSV circulation was also reported during the 403 Southern Hemisphere winter ( 2 , 5 , 9 ) , and climatic factors cannot explain the rebound of hCoV , hMPV , and RSV B 404 outside of their typical seasons . 405 Our findings suggest that in - person school instruction played a key role in the rebound of enveloped viruses in 406 Seattle . Prior research has shown that increased contact rates among older children during school terms influence the 407 timing of seasonal influenza and “common cold” virus outbreaks ( 29 , 57 , 58 ) , and younger children and adults 408 acquire influenza and RSV infections from preschool or school - aged children living in the same household ( 59 - 61 ) . 409 All King County public school districts began the 2020 - 2021 academic year remotely ( 62 ) , with some districts 410 offering limited in - person instruction to special education students during Fall 2020 . Foot traffic to schools was 75 % 411 below baseline in Fall 2020 , gradually increased to 50 % below baseline during Spring 2021 , and returned to baseline 412 levels in Fall 2021 . We observed that the circulation of hCoV , hPIV , and hMPV increased after elementary school 413 students were offered in - person instruction in February and March 2021 and that the off - season RSV B wave in 414 summer 2021 began directly after hybrid learning became available to all grades in mid - April ( 62 ) . These trends 415 suggest that a year of remote learning , and in turn reduced contacts among school - aged children , contributed to the 416 delayed return of enveloped virus circulation to Seattle . 417 The rebound of enveloped viruses also coincided with increasing rates of travel into Seattle . Annual influenza 418 epidemics in North America are seeded via air travel by strains originating in East and Southeast Asia ( 63 , 64 ) , and 419 the regional spread of influenza viruses correlates closely with work commutes ( 65 , 66 ) . We did not have data on 420 international air travel or commuting patterns , but cell phone data show that the inflow of visitors from other WA 421 counties and US states was 50 % below baseline throughout 2020 and did not return to pre - pandemic levels until late 422 spring or summer 2021 . Although the contribution of local persistence versus external seeding is less understood for 423 other seasonal respiratory viruses , increasing inflow into Seattle likely imported cases from other regions , seeding 424 new outbreaks ( 9 ) . 425 for use under a CC0 license .

This “immunity debt” may have provided enough susceptible individuals to 428 sustain spring and summer outbreaks of enveloped viruses . Although we expected these outbreaks to be larger or 429 more severe than those observed during pre - pandemic seasons , substantial influenza and RSV epidemics did not 430 occur until the Fall of 2022 , potentially due to Seattle residents continuing to social distance and mask throughout 431 2021 or negative interference between Omicron BA . 1 viruses and endemic viruses during the 2021 - 2022 winter 432 season . After the conclusion of our study , the 2022 - 2023 season saw atypically early outbreaks of influenza and 433 RSV and higher hospitalization rates in children and adolescents compared to pre - pandemic seasons ( 15 , 68 ) . 434 Our study has limitations related to the type of cell phone mobility data used and the underlying demographics of 435 mobile device data in general . Young children experience the highest rates of endemic respiratory infections , but 436 SafeGraph does not track individuals younger than 16 years of age . Nonetheless , we found that visits to schools and 437 daycares were positive , leading indicators of transmission , both prior to and during the pandemic , demonstrating that 438 mobile phone data derived from adults can approximate the movements or contacts of children . Second , although we 439 found statistically significant associations between foot traffic indicators and pathogen transmission , spatial co - 440 location data may better approximate the interpersonal contacts that underlie transmission and reduce statistical 441 noise . Longitudinal cross - sectional surveys on social interactions , such as the CoMix survey in England , can provide 442 more direct measures of epidemiologically relevant behavior and more representative samples of populations than 443 mobile device data ( 69 ) . However , to our knowledge , similar data do not exist for the US . 444 Our findings are subject to several other limitations . First , due to the limited number of seasons in our study , we 445 could not determine if leading indicators of transmission are consistent across timespans longer than four years . 446 Although SFS continued to conduct respiratory surveillance into the 2022 - 2023 winter season , its community 447 surveillance approach changed substantially after July 2022 , making it difficult to extend our study . Second , 448 variability in test volume over time caused SFS surveillance to sometimes miss less prevalent pathogens . For 449 example , SFS detected only a few cases during a small influenza A / H3N2 wave in winter 2021 - 2022 . Third , our 450 multiplex PCR assay could not distinguish between types , strains , or serotypes of some pathogens ( hCoV , hPIV , 451 AdV , hRV ) . Consequently , our Rt estimates may average over heterogeneities in transmission dynamics among 452 viruses belonging to the same species ( 19 ) . Fourth , previous work has shown that SARS - CoV - 2 transmission 453 dynamics differed between North and South King County ( 20 , 70 ) , potentially due to socioeconomic inequities ( e . g . , 454 differences in income , household size , proportion of essential workers ) and North King County maintaining a 455 greater reduction in mobility over time . However , we did not have sufficient surveillance data to explore geographic 456 differences in the transmission dynamics of endemic viruses . Fifth , population immunity may modulate relationships 457 between mobility and transmission ; analysis of serologic data could shed light on this question . Additional research 458 is needed to delineate the contributions of an increasingly susceptible population and decreased social distancing to 459 the rebound of endemic viruses . 460 In summary , mobility patterns are most predictive of respiratory virus transmission during drastic changes in 461 contacts , and , to a lesser extent , at the beginning of epidemic waves . During the pandemic period , endemic 462 respiratory viruses exhibited stronger relationships with mobility than pandemic SARS - CoV - 2 . As SARS - CoV - 2 463 transitions to endemicity , relationships with mobility could gradually start to operate similarly to those of other 464 enveloped viruses . Our study shows that mobile phone data can approximate transmission relevant contacts and has 465 the potential to support the surveillance of endemic respiratory viruses , with the caveat that relationships between 466 transmission and mobility vary depending on the pathogen , magnitude of mobility change , and phase of the 467 epidemic . Future research should consider other host factors , such as prior immunity , and more direct proxies of 468 interpersonal contacts to further disentangle relationships between population behavior and respiratory virus 469 dynamics . 470 Methods 471 Virologic surveillance and laboratory methods 472 This population - level study uses cross - sectional surveillance data collected through the Seattle Flu Study ( SFS ) from 473 November 2018 to June 2022 . Initiated in November 2018 , SFS was a multi - arm surveillance study of influenza and 474 other respiratory pathogens in the greater Seattle , WA region , that utilized community and hospital - based sampling 475 for use under a CC0 license .

In its first 1 . 5 years , SFS tracked the transmission of influenza and other respiratory pathogens in the Seattle 476 region by testing swabs collected at hospitals , community sites ( e . g . , kiosks in high foot traffic areas , outpatient 477 clinics , workplaces , college campuses ) , and through its swab - and - send at - home testing study ( 17 , 22 ) ( Table S2 ) . 478 The SFS team launched the greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network ( SCAN ) in March 2020 to detect and 479 understand the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 ( 23 ) . SCAN deployed self - administered at - home testing kits to monitor the 480 spread of both SARS - CoV - 2 and endemic respiratory pathogens from March 2020 to July 2022 . We describe each 481 surveillance arm in the supplementary methods . 482 The Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington gave ethical approval of this work ( protocol 483 # 00006181 ) . All participants who contributed specimens to the Seattle Flu Study or Greater Seattle Coronavirus 484 Assessment Network provided informed consent at enrollment . Informed consent for residual sample and clinical 485 data collection was waived , as these samples were already collected as part of routine clinical care , and it was not 486 possible to re - contact these individuals . This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational 487 Studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE ) reporting guidelines for cross - sectional studies . 488 Each respiratory specimen was screened in duplicate for a panel of respiratory pathogens using a custom TaqMan 489 RT - PCR OpenArray panel ( Thermo Fisher ) . Laboratory methods are described in detail elsewhere ( 20 , 22 ) . 490 Pathogen targets included adenovirus ( AdV ) ; human bocavirus ( hBoV ) ; human coronaviruses ( hCoV ) 229E , OC43 , 491 HKU1 , and NL63 ; human metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) ; human parainfluenza viruses ( hPIV ) 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ; human 492 parechovirus ( hPeV ) ; influenza A ( IAV ) H1N1 and H3N2 ; pan influenza A ( IAV ) ; pan influenza B ( IBV ) ; pan 493 influenza C ( ICV ) ; respiratory syncytial viruses ( RSV ) A and B ; human rhinovirus ( hRV ) ; enterovirus D68 494 ( EV . D68 ) ; pan enterovirus excluding D68 ( EV ) ; Streptococcus pneumoniae ( Spn ) ; Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( Mpn ) ; 495 Chlamydia pneumoniae ( Cpn ) ; and SARS - CoV - 2 . Due to assay limitations , epidemiologically distinct strains were 496 grouped into one assay each for hCoV 229E and hCoV OC43 , hCoV HKU1 and hCoV NL63 , hPIV 1 and hPIV 2 , 497 hPIV 3 and hPIV 4 , EV , hRV , and AdV . 498 A substantial number of specimens tested positive for SPn , a common commensal , with SPn detected in 27 . 3 % of 499 positive samples prior to March 2020 and 18 . 7 % of positive samples after March 2020 ( Figure S2 ) . We opted to not 500 include SPn in downstream analyses due to our inability to distinguish acute infections from chronic carriage . 501 Syndromic surveillance data 502 We obtained respiratory syndromic surveillance data for King County , WA from the Rapid Health Information 503 Network ( RHINO ) program at the Washington Department of Health ( WA DOH ) ( Figure S21 ) . Syndrome criteria 504 are defined by the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community - Based Epidemics 505 ( ESSENCE ) . We received weekly counts of total emergency department ( ED ) visits and ED visits classified as 506 influenza - like illness ( ILI ) ( mention OR diagnosis of influenza OR fever ( > 100°F ) and cough OR fever ( > 100F ) and 507 sore throat ) , COVID - like illness ( CLI ) ( mention OR diagnosis of coronavirus AND no diagnosis of influenza OR 508 fever OR chills AND cough OR shortness of breath OR difficulty breathing ) , and broad respiratory illness ( acute 509 bronchitis OR chest congestion OR cough OR difficulty breathing OR hemoptysis OR laryngitis OR lower 510 respiratory infection OR nasal congestion OR otitis media OR pneumonia OR shortness of breath OR sore throat OR 511 upper respiratory infection OR wheezing OR acute respiratory distress ) . Weekly data were disaggregated by age 512 group ( 0 - 4 , 5 - 24 , 25 - 64 , and ≥ 65 ) . We collapsed age groups into two categories , < 5 and ≥ 5 years of age , and 513 calculated the weekly proportion of ED visits coded as ILI , CLI , or broad respiratory illness ( Figure S21 ) . 514 Respiratory syndromic surveillance data for Washington state were obtained from the U . S . Outpatient Influenza - like 515 Illness Surveillance Network ( ILINet ) via the CDC FluView Interactive dashboard ( 71 ) . ILINet consists of 516 approximately 3 , 200 sentinel outpatient healthcare providers throughout the United States that report the total 517 number of consultations for any reason and the number of consultations for ILI every week . ILI is defined as fever 518 ( temperature of 100°F [ 37 . 8°C ] or greater ) and a cough and / or a sore throat . ILINet provides the weekly proportion 519 of outpatient consultations for ILI and the number of ILI encounters by age group ( 0 - 4 , 5 - 24 , 25 - 64 , and ≥65 ) . 520 521 for use under a CC0 license .

We estimated foot traffic to 525 specific points of interests ( POIs ) , movement within and between census block groups , and the in - flow of visitors 526 residing outside of King County from June 2018 to June 2022 , using SafeGraph’s “Weekly Patterns” dataset , which 527 provides weekly counts of the total number of unique devices visiting a POI from a particular home location . POIs 528 are fixed locations , such as businesses or attractions . A “visit” indicates that a device entered the building or spatial 529 perimeter designated as a POI . A “home location” of a device is defined as its common nighttime ( 18 : 00 - 7 : 00 ) 530 census block group ( CBG ) for the past 6 consecutive weeks . We restricted our datasets to King County POIs that 531 had been recorded in SafeGraph’s dataset since January 2019 . 532 To measure movement within and between CBGs ( “neighborhoods” ) in King County , we extracted the home CBG 533 of devices visiting points of interest ( POIs ) and limited the dataset to devices with home locations in the CBG of a 534 given POI ( within - neighborhood movement ) or with home locations in CBGs outside of a given POI’s CBG 535 ( between - neighborhood movement ) . To measure the inflow of visitors from other counties in Washington state or 536 from out - of - state , we limited the dataset to devices visiting POIs in King County with home locations in other WA 537 counties or in other US states , respectively . For each POI in each week , we excluded home census block groups with 538 fewer than five visitors to that POI . To measure foot traffic to specific categories of POIs , we aggregated daily visits 539 to POIs by North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS ) category , without considering the home 540 locations of devices visiting these POIs . To adjust for variation in SafeGraph’s device panel size over time , we 541 divided Washington’s census population size by the number of devices in SafeGraph’s panel with home locations in 542 Washington state each month and multiplied the number of daily or weekly visitors by that value . For each mobility 543 indicator , we summed adjusted daily or weekly visits across POIs and measured the percent change in movement 544 over time relative to the average movement observed in all of 2019 , excluding national holidays . 545 Daily data on the percentage of devices staying home in King County were obtained from SafeGraph’s Social 546 Distancing Metrics ( https : / / docs . safegraph . com / docs / social - distancing - metrics ) and Meta Data for Good’s 547 Movement Range Maps ( https : / / dataforgood . facebook . com / dfg / tools / movement - range - maps ) ( 72 ) . SafeGraph social 548 distancing metrics were available from January 1 , 2019 , to April 16 , 2021 , and Meta Movement Range Maps were 549 available from March 1 , 2020 , to May 22 , 2022 . Trends in the percentage of devices staying home were almost 550 identical across the two data sources , though the percentage of devices staying home in the Meta dataset was lower 551 than that observed in the SafeGraph dataset . We added a scaling factor to the Meta indicator and joined the two time 552 series to create a single metric for our study period . 553 We obtained survey data on the daily percentage of King County residents wearing face masks in public from the 554 Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Group Covidcast API ( 28 ) . Masking data were collected as part of the COVID - 555 19 Trends and Impact Survey conducted by the Delphi group , in collaboration with Meta and a consortium of 556 universities and public health officials ( 73 ) . The survey ran continuously from April 6 , 2020 , to June 25 , 2022 , with 557 approximately 40 , 000 individuals in the United States participating every day . The survey included specific 558 questions about masking from September 8 , 2020 , to June 25 , 2022 . We supplemented the Covidcast King County 559 masking data with COVIDNearYou survey data for Washington state ( 74 ) to extend the time series to June 2 , 2020 . 560 We extracted data collected by the Oxford COVID - 19 Government Response Tracker ( OxCGRT ) ( 27 ) to measure 561 variation in Washington state’s government policies related to COVID - 19 from March 1 , 2020 to June 30 , 2022 . 562 The OxCGRT database tracked publicly available information for policies related to closure and containment , 563 health , and economic policy in 180 countries , recording policy responses on ordinal or continuous scales for 19 564 policy areas . We obtained daily values for the stringency index , which combines all containment and closure ( C ) 565 indicators and the H1 indicator ( public information campaigns ) . 566 Reconstructing pathogen incidences 567 While SFS sampling is robust enough to provide granular ( daily ) surveillance data on the circulation of multiple 568 pathogens , the diversity of SFS sampling schemes requires pre - processing to infer pathogen incidence .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted November 1 , 2023 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2023 . 10 . 31 . 23297868 doi : medRxiv preprint Perofsky 17 reconstruct pathogen incidences through time , we considered the different populations sampled by SFS , particularly 570 regarding age group , clinical setting , and the presence of respiratory symptoms . 571 We first excluded samples with missing age or home address information ( as reported by individuals participating in 572 community surveillance or obtained through electronic hospital records ) , samples from individuals residing outside 573 the greater Seattle region ( King , Pierce , Snohomish , Kitsap , San Juan , Whatcom , Skagit , Island , Clallam , Jefferson , 574 Mason , and Thurston counties ) , samples from individuals who were asymptomatic for respiratory illness , and 575 samples from multiple testing of individuals . If an individual was tested more than once in a 30 - day period , we kept 576 one result per pathogen in that period . If test results for all pathogens were consistent across the testing instances in 577 the 30 - day period , we kept the results from the first testing instance and discarded the subsequent instances . If an 578 individual tested negative and then positive , or tested positive then negative , we kept the result for the first positive 579 testing instance and discarded the instances prior to or after that result . We also excluded samples collected as part 580 of Public Health – Seattle & King County’s ( PHSKC ) contact tracing efforts or through collaborations with 581 community - based organizations . 582 Next , we used a three - step approach to control for sampling variation over time . In the first step , we disaggregated 583 daily pathogen presence and absence data derived from OpenArray testing by clinical setting ( hospital or 584 community ) and age ( ≥ 5 years or < 5 years ) . We then divided the number of positive samples for each pathogen by 585 the total number of specimens tested in each setting and age stratum . Daily proportion positive values were 586 multiplied by the expected age distribution of cases for each pathogen in each setting , which were obtained from the 587 U . S . Outpatient Influenza - like Illness Surveillance Network ( ILINet ) ( 71 ) , the U . S . Influenza Hospitalization 588 Surveillance Network ( FluSurv - NET ) ( 75 ) , the Washington State Department of Health ( 76 ) , or published literature 589 ( Table S4 ) . 590 In the second step , we combined pathogen proportion positive information from SFS virologic surveillance with 591 citywide syndromic surveillance indicators for respiratory illnesses . A similar approach has been successfully used 592 to model influenza activity over multiple seasons ( 77 ) . Specifically , we multiplied the age - adjusted proportion 593 positive data by a weekly indicator of the proportion of the King County population seeking care for respiratory 594 illness at emergency departments ( ED ) . This adjustment was applied separately to community and hospital data to 595 generate community and hospital - based incidences for each pathogen . For hospital - and community - based 596 incidences of each pathogen , we multiplied daily proportion positive values for individuals < 5 or ≥ 5 years by the 597 weekly percentage of ED visits coded as general respiratory illness ( all endemic viruses except influenza ) , 598 influenza - like illness , ILI ( influenza ) , or COVID - like illness , CLI ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) for each age group . 599 In a third step , hospital - and community - based incidences were each rescaled to fall between 0 and 1 and summed to 600 provide an aggregate measure of incidences in the greater Seattle region . We used this approach to estimate daily 601 incidences from November 2018 to June 2022 for pathogens with sufficient sampling ( ≥ 400 positive specimens 602 during 2018 – 2022 ) , including influenza A / H1N1 , A / H3N2 , and B viruses , RSV A and B , seasonal coronaviruses , 603 human parainfluenza viruses , human metapneumovirus , rhinovirus , and adenovirus . 604 We estimated daily SARS - CoV - 2 incidence from publicly available COVID - 19 case data for King County ( 76 ) 605 because SCAN did not test respiratory specimens for SARS - CoV - 2 during May and June 2020 ( Figure S22 ) . 606 Statistical analysis 607 All analyses were performed using R version 4 . 3 . 0 . 608 Transmission modeling . For each pathogen , we estimated time - varying ( instantaneous ) reproduction numbers , Rt , 609 by date of infection using the Epidemia R package ( 26 ) . The instantaneous reproduction number is the number of 610 secondary cases arising from a symptomatic individual at a particular time , assuming conditions remain identical 611 after that time . Epidemia implements a semi - mechanistic Bayesian model using the probabilistic programming 612 language Stan ( 78 ) . Prior to Rt estimation , we computed proxies of daily case counts of endemic pathogens by 613 multiplying daily incidence rates by 1000 and rounding the resultant values to integers . We estimated reporting 614 delays ( i . e . , the delay from symptom onset to testing ) using kiosk , swab - and - send , and SCAN questionnaire 615 metadata collected from symptomatic individuals who tested positive for endemic respiratory viruses ( hRV , N = 616 for use under a CC0 license .

We used Stan to fit a lognormal distribution to 100 subsampled 618 bootstraps ( each with 250 samples drawn with replacement ) of the available reporting delay data separately for all 619 endemic respiratory viruses combined and SARS - CoV - 2 , with a maximum allowed delay of 30 days ( EpiNow2 R 620 package ( 79 ) ) . This resulted in a lognormal onset - to - testing delay distribution with mean 0 . 49 ( 1 . 02 SD ) days for 621 endemic viruses and mean 0 . 65 ( 1 . 1 SD ) days for SARS - CoV - 2 . 622 To estimate Rt , observed cases were modelled as a function of latent infections in the population , assuming a 623 negative binomial distribution . For each pathogen , we estimated the time distribution for infection - to - case - 624 observation by summing the lognormal - distributed incubation period and the lognormal - distributed reporting delay . 625 Pathogen - specific incubation periods and generation or serial intervals were obtained from published literature 626 ( Table S5 ) . Instead of using the renewal equation to propagate infections , we treated infections as latent parameters 627 in the model , because the additional variance around infections leads to a posterior distribution that is easier to 628 sample ( 26 ) . To control for temporal autocorrelation , we modelled Rt as a daily random walk . Epidemic trajectories 629 were fit independently using Stan’s Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler . For each model , we ran 4 chains , each for 630 30 , 000 iterations ( including a burn - in period of 15 , 000 iterations that was discarded ) , producing a total posterior 631 sample size of 60 , 000 . We verified convergence by confirming that all parameters had sufficiently low R̂ hat values 632 ( all R hat < 1 . 1⁠ ) and sufficiently large effective sample sizes ( > 15 % of the total sample size ) . 633 Following methods from ( 1 ) , we evaluated changes in transmissibility during the two weeks before and after two 634 major events during our study period : a major snowstorm in February 2019 and the initiation of COVID - 19 social 635 distancing measures in March 2020 . We used t - tests for the ratio of two means to compare Rt values before and after 636 each event and Fieller’s theorem to calculate the 95 % confidence intervals of changes in Rt . 637 Cross - correlations between human behavior and pathogen transmission . From Fall 2019 to Summer 2022 , we 638 computed Pearson cross - correlations between weekly pathogen specific Rt values and the weekly percent change 639 from baseline in mobility , in rolling five - month windows . During the 2018 - 2019 respiratory virus season , we 640 computed cross - correlations between daily Rt values and the daily percent change from baseline in mobility in 641 rolling one - month windows , due to limited data at the start of that season ( SFS began collecting samples in 642 November 2018 ) and to better capture the effects of the 12 - day snowstorm in February 2019 . For time periods that 643 data were available , we estimated weekly cross - correlations and optimal lags between Rt and the proportion of 644 individuals masking in public ( June 2020 to June 2022 ) and between Rt and the Oxford Stringency Index ( March 645 2020 to June 2022 ) . In all analyses , cross - correlations were weighted with an exponential decay such that 646 observations at the edges of each time window were weighted approximately 50 % less than observations at the 647 window midpoint . 648 For each rolling window , we estimated weighted cross - correlations between mobility behavior and Rt at different 649 lags ( up to 4 weeks for 5 - month rolling windows and up to 14 days for one - month rolling windows ) and extracted 650 the maximum ( absolute ) coefficient value and the lag ( in weeks or days ) at which this value occurred ( the ‘optimal 651 lag’ ) . Negative lag values indicate behavior leads Rt , and positive lag values indicate Rt leads behavior . A lag of 0 652 indicates that two time series are in phase ( i . e . , synchronous ) . To generate monthly cross - correlations and lags , we 653 averaged the correlation coefficients and optimal lags of window midpoints that fell within a given calendar month . 654 As an example , for five - month rolling windows each month’s statistics are an average of correlation coefficients and 655 lags for dates falling 10 weeks prior to and 10 weeks following each week in that month . To test the statistical 656 significance of cross - correlations for each rolling window , we used a block bootstrap approach to generate 1000 657 samples of each mobility time series in two week increments and recomputed weighted cross - correlations between 658 Rt and mobility for each replicate , yielding a null distribution of 1000 cross - correlations . Cross - correlations between 659 Rt and mobility indicators were considered statistically significant when observed coefficients were outside the 660 bounds of the null distribution’s 90 % interval . 661 As a sensitivity analysis , we estimated the daily transmissibility of the ancestral SARS - CoV - 2 virus and each major 662 variant of concern ( VOC ) , using generation intervals , incubation periods , and reporting delays specific to each 663 lineage , and computed rolling cross - correlations between VOC - specific Rt values and behavioral indicators . Most 664 VOC time series were too short to measure dynamic changes in correlations between Rt and behavior , likely 665 because we could not include the period immediately preceding increases in Rt in VOC - specific analyses . 666 for use under a CC0 license .

We used multivariable generalized additive regression 667 models ( GAMs ) to measure non - linear relationships between mobility and Rt and assess the relative importance of 668 different indicators in predicting Rt for each pathogen during key epidemiological timepoints : the beginning of the 669 2019 - 2020 respiratory virus season ( September 2019 – January 2020 ) , the first three months of each of four 670 COVID - 19 waves , the first six months of rebound of non - enveloped viruses ( June – November 2020 ) , the first three 671 months of rebound of each enveloped virus in 2021 ( January – August 2021 ) , and the decline of endemic viruses 672 during the Omicron wave in late 2021 ( November 2021 – January 2022 ) . We used the mgcv R package ( 80 ) to fit 673 each GAM with a Gamma error distribution and log link . Mobility covariates and time trends were modelled using 674 thin plate regression splines ( the default smooth for s terms ) . We specified for the model to add an extra penalty to 675 each term so that it could be penalized to zero ( select = TRUE ) , which enables the smoothing parameter estimation 676 to completely remove terms when fitting the model . 677 To further refine our set of predictors and reduce concurvity , we used Akaike’s Information Criteria corrected for 678 small sample sizes ( AICc ) to select the best fit “minimal” model for each pathogen , allowing candidate models to 679 include a smoothed weekly time trend and up to two smoothed population behavior terms . Candidate predictors 680 included within - neighborhood movement , between - neighborhood movement , inflow from other WA counties , 681 inflow from other US states , the percentage of devices leaving home , and foot traffic to different categories of POIs , 682 including restaurants , religious organizations , child daycare centers , elementary and high schools , and colleges . For 683 SARS - CoV - 2 , we also included the proportion of individuals masking in public and NPI stringency as candidate 684 predictors . After performing model selection of candidate models , parameter estimation of the final model was 685 performed by restricted maximum likelihood . 686 687 for use under a CC0 license .
