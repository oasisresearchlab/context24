INTRODUCTION The small molecular weight GTP - binding proteins ( smw G proteins ) Rho A , B , C , E and G , Rac 1 and Rac 2 , Cdc42 and TC10 are a family of molecular switches which are 30 % identical to Ras and 55 % identical to each other ( Boguski and McCormick , 1993 ) . The Rho - family members regulate a variety of cellular responses including actin polymerization and reorganization , gene expression ( p38 / JNK and SRF activity ) , cleavage furrow formation , G 1 cell cycle progression , endocytosis , exocytosis , and superoxide production ( Ridley , 1996 ) . Cytoskeletal rearrangement is one of the best characterized responses of Rho - family members . Studies employing quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells have indicated that Rho - dependent regulation of the cytoskeleton involves signaling through Cdc42 , Rac and Rho ( Hall , 1998 ) . In these cells activation of Cdc42 ( by bradykinin , tumor necrosis factor - a ( TNF - a ) and IL - 1 ( interleukin - 1 ) ) stimulates the formation of ﬁnger - like projections of actin ﬁlaments called ﬁlopodia . Activation of Rac ( either indirectly by Cdc42 - mediated signaling or directly by platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , bombesin , or insulin ) results in extensions of broad sheet - like structures called lamellipodia . Finally , activation of Rho ( indirectly by Rac - mediated signaling or directly by bombesin ; sphingosine 1 - phosphate ( SPP ) or lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) results in the formation of actin stress ﬁbers and focal adhesions ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Ridley and Hall , 1992 , 1994 ; Ridley et al . , 1992 ; Chant and Stowers , 1995 ) . The cyclical production of these actin - based structures is proposed to be important for cellular motility . In fact , activated Cdc42 and Rac increase the motility and invasiveness of mammary carcinoma cells ( Keely et al . , 1997 ) and a dominant - interfering mutant for Rac blocks PDGF - stimulated migration of Rat - 1 ﬁbroblasts ( Anand - Apte et al . , 1997 ) . The downstream effectors of Cdc42 , Rac and Rho which lead to the assembly of ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia and stress ﬁbers are not fully understood ; however , some potential candidates have been recently identiﬁed . Some evidence suggests that smw G proteins utilize protein kinases to elicit their effects on actin polymerization . Both Cdc42 and Rac activate the tyrosine kinase Ack as well as the serine / threonine kinase PAK . Rho activates several serine / threonine kinases including protein kinase N , p164 Rho kinase ( ROK a or ROCK ) and PRK2 kinase ( which is also activated by Rac ) ( Vincent and 231 Journal of Cell Science 112 , 231 - 242 ( 1999 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1998 JCS4625 Graf , the GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase was previously shown to have GAP activity for Rho A and Cdc42 in vitro ( Hildebrand et al 1996 Mol . Cell Biol . 16 : 3169 - 3178 ) . In this study we sought to determine whether Graf acted at the level of Cdc42 , Rho , or both in vivo and whether Graf was a signal terminator or transducer for these proteins . Microinjection of Graf cDNA into subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells ( in the presence of serum ) has marked effects on cell shape and actin localization . Graf expression causes clearing of stress ﬁbers followed by formation of long actin based ﬁlopodial - like extensions . Similar phenotypes were observed following injection of the Rho - inhibitor , C3 into these cells . The Graf response was dependent on GAP activity , since injection of Graf cDNA containing point mutations in the GAP domain ( R236Q or N351V ) which block enzymatic activity , does not confer this phenotype . Injection of Graf into Swiss 3T3 cells in which Rho has been down - regulated by serum starvation has no effect on cell morphology . Using this system , we demonstrate that Graf blocks sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( SPP ) stimulated ( Rho - mediated ) stress ﬁber formation . Conversely , Graf expression does not inhibit bradykinin stimulated ( Cdc42 - mediated ) ﬁlopodial extensions . These data indicate that Graf is a GAP for Rho in vivo . To further substantiate these results we examined the effect of Graf over - expression on Rho - mediated neurite retraction in nerve growth factor ( NGF ) - differentiated PC12 cells . In PC12 cells , which express relatively high levels of endogenous Graf , overexpression of Graf ( but not Graf containing the R236Q mutation ) enhances SPP - induced neurite retraction . These data indicate the possibility that Graf may be an effector for Rho in certain cell types . Key words : Rho , GAP , Cytoskeleton SUMMARY Cytoskeletal changes induced by GRAF , the GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase , are mediated by Rho Joan M . Taylor , Marlene M .

In addition to protein kinase signaling , Rho binds to and stimulates a lipid kinase , phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate - 5 - kinase ( PIP5 - K ) , which converts phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate ( PIP ) to polyphosphatidyl inositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ; Ren et al . , 1996 ) . PIP2 binds to and regulates a number of actin binding proteins resulting in enhanced actin polymerization ( Taylor et al . , 1998a ) . Another potential pathway whereby Rho family members could regulate down - stream signaling is through their GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) . Although GAP proteins down - regulate the signal input by rapidly converting the active GTP bound G protein to the inactive GDP bound state , certain GAP proteins including p120Ras GAP , n - chimaerin , and PLC ( a GAP for heterotrimeric G proteins ) simultaneously send a signal which is required for downstream signaling from the G protein ( Duchesne et al . , 1993 ; Boguski and McCormick , 1993 ; Kozma et al . , 1996 ) . For example , microinjection of the Rac GAP n - chimaerin ( like activated Rac ) induces the formation of lamellipodia , an effect that is dependent on Rac , but not dependent on the GAP activity of n - chimaerin ( Kozma et al . , 1996 ) . Apparently , the binding of n - chimaerin to activated Rac enhances a functional interaction between n - chimaerin and another unknown protein ( s ) to regulate cellular morphology . Graf ( GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase ) is a recently identiﬁed GTPase activating protein containing a centrally located GAP domain , followed by a serine / proline rich domain and a carboxy - terminal Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain . In vitro , the Graf GAP domain enhances GTP hydrolysis of both Cdc42 and RhoA but not Rac1 or Ras . Graf is a binding partner for focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) in that the SH3 domain of Graf binds to PXXP motifs within the C - terminal domain of FAK ( Hildebrand et al . , 1996 ) . The aim of this study was to characterize Graf activity in vivo . More speciﬁcally , we tested whether in vivo , Graf acts at the level of Cdc42 , Rho , or both and whether Graf is a signal terminator or transducer for these proteins . We show herein that ectopic expression of Graf has marked effects on cell shape and actin localization in growing Swiss 3T3 cells . The Graf - injected cells extend long stable ﬁlopodia , an effect that is dependent on Graf’s GAP activity and is similar to the effects of the Rho inhibitor , C3 exoenzyme . The ability of Graf to block SPP - mediated ( but not bradykinin - mediated ) signaling in quiescent cells suggests that Graf is an in vivo regulator of Rho . Interestingly , overexpression of Graf in PC12 cells enhances SPP - induced ( Rho - mediated ) neurite retraction , indicating that Graf may be a down - stream effector for Rho in certain cell types . MATERIALS AND METHODS Epitope - tagged Graf , deletion constructs and mutagenesis All Cdc42 , Rac , Rho and C3 constructs were generous gifts from Alan Hall . The cDNA construct encoding the N - terminal Flag - tagged variant of Graf ( F - Graf ; aa 1 - 584 ) was generated by PCR using primers that engineered 5 ¢ Hin dIII and 3 ¢ Xho I restriction sites . The PCR product was digested with Hin dIII and Xho I and ligated into Hin dIII and Xho I digested pcDNA3 containing a 7 amino acid N - terminal epitope tag with the sequence , DYKDDDK . The Flag - tagged N - terminal Graf construct ( F - NT ; aa 1 - 241 ) was generated by digesting F - Graf with Xba I and religated to remove the C - terminal GAP and SH3 domains . The Flag - tagged GAP construct ( F - GAP ; aa 1 - 422 ) generated by digesting F - Graf with Hin dIII and Not I and ligating into Hin dIII and Not I digested pcDNA3 to remove the C - terminal SH3 domain . The Flag - tagged SH3 construct ( F - SH3 ; aa 472 - 584 ) was generated by digesting F - Graf with Eco RI and Xho I and ligating into Eco RI and Xho I digested pcDNA3 . The C - terminal green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged variants of Graf were obtained by digesting F - Graf or R236Q with Hin dIII and Xho I and ligating into Hin dIII and Sal I digested pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech ) . Mutations resulting in Graf point mutants R236Q , N351V and S510A were generated in F - Graf using PCR based site - directed mutagenesis ( Quick Change , Stratagene ) . The sequence of all constructs was veriﬁed by direct DNA sequencing . Cell culture and transfection Swiss 3T3 ( ATCC ) and COS - 1 ( ATCC ) cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10 % FCS , and a 1 % penicillin - streptomycin solution . For transfections , COS - 1 cells were plated at 2 · 10 5 cells / ml and transfected with the Superfect reagent ( Gibco ) using 10 m g plasmid DNA per 100 cm dish . Cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 4 hours in the presence of serum and antibiotics . Cells were rinsed and incubated in serum - containing medium for 24 - 48 hours prior to harvesting . PC12 cells ( ATCC ) were maintained in DMEM containing 10 % HS , 5 % FCS and a 1 % penicillin - streptomycin solution . For transfections , PC12 cells were plated at 2 · 10 4 cells / ml on 35 mm dishes coated with laminin ( 10 m g / ml ) . Cells were transfected with the Superfect reagent ( Gibco ) using 2 m g plasmid DNA per 35 mm dish as described above . After 24 hours , cells were treated with 100 nM NGF for a 72 hour period to induce neuronal differentiation . Microinjection For most microinjection experiments , Swiss 3T3 cells ( 5 · 10 4 cells / 35 mm dish ) were plated in the presence of serum onto gridded glass coverslips and allowed to attach and spread overnight . Serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared as described previously ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ) . Brieﬂy , 1 · 10 5 cells / 60 mm dish were plated in serum and incubated for 7 - 10 days prior to serum starving for 16 hours Cells were then trypsinized and resuspended in serum - free DMEM containing 0 . 5 mg / ml soybean trypsin inhibitor . Cells were centrifuged , resuspended in serum - free medium and replated onto gridded glass coverslips ( 6 · 10 4 cells / 35 mm dish ) pre - coated with ﬁbronectin ( 10 m g / ml ) . Eukaryotic expression vectors encoding the cDNAs for Graf ( in Flag - pCDNA3 or myc - PRK5 ) CDC42 ( L61 ) , Rac ( L61 ) and Rho ( L63 ; in myc - PRK5 ) or C3 ( in pEF ) were diluted into TE buffer ( 10 mMTris - HCl , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8 . 5 ) and microinjected into the nucleus of cells using a Zeiss micromanipulator . Certain constructs were injected with the cDNA for GFP ( pEGFP - N1 ; 5 ng / m l ) to aid in the detection of injected cells . Routinely 50 - 70 cells were injected within a period of 15 minutes . Injected cells were then incubated at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 for 1 - 4 hours before ﬁxation . Immunocytochemistry For immunoﬂuorescence staining , cells were washed three times with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , calcium and magnesium free ) and ﬁxed using 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at RT . Cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 4 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 3 minutes at RT . Slides were washed three times in PBS to remove the detergent and were incubated with either the primary anti - Flag monoclonal antibody , M5 ( 5 m g / ml ) or anti - myc monoclonal antibody , 9E10 ( 1 m g / ml ) for 1 hour followed by Texas Red - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibody ( Ab ; 5 m g / ml ) for 1 hour . J . M . Taylor , M . M . Macklem and J . T . Parsons 233 Graf regulates Rho signaling A ﬂuorescent phalloidin ( 1 : 1000 ﬂuorescein or Texas Red conjugated ; Molecular Probes ) was used to visualize ﬁlamentous actin . Immunoprecipitation and western blots COS - 1 cells overexpressing F - Graf or F - Graf variants were lysed by scraping cells into 2 · Laemmli sample buffer . Proteins were separated using 10 - 12 % sodium dodecylsulfate - polyacrylamide gels ( SDS - PAGE ) . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose , and western blots were performed using the Flag - tag speciﬁc monoclonal antibody M5 at a 1 / 1000 dilution . Blots were then incubated with HRP - conjugated donkey anti - mouse Ab at a 1 / 1000 dilution , followed by visualization by chemiluminescence ( ECL , Amersham ) . GTPase activation assays For GTPase activation analysis of in vivo expressed Graf constructs , F - Graf and the GAP domain mutants were immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of over - expressing COS - 1 cells using the Flag - tag speciﬁc monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , M5 ( 10 m g / ml ) . Immune complexes were washed twice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer ( RIPA ) , once with TBS and once with GAP buffer and resuspended in 100 m l GAP buffer . Cdc42 or Rho ( gifts from Alan Hall ) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E . coli and puriﬁed by thrombin cleavage as previously described ( Self and Hall , 1995 ) . For the GAP assays , 1 m g of puriﬁed Cdc42 or Rho were loaded with 20 m Ci of [ g - 32 P ] GTP ( 6 , 000 Ci / mmol ; Dupont NEN ) in loading buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mg / ml BSA , 1 mM DTT ) for 15 minutes at RT . MgCl 2 was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM to stop the exchange reaction . The labeled G protein was diluted to 5 nM in GTPase buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mg / ml BSA , 1 mM DTT ) , combined with the Graf immunoprecipitates , then incubated for 15 minutes at RT . Following incubation , 1 ml of wash buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) was added and the mixture was ﬁltered through nitrocellulose membranes ( B85 ; Schleicher & Schuell ) . Membranes were washed with 10 ml of wash buffer and counted to determine the amount of [ g - 32 P ] GTP remaining . To ensure equal loading , one - ﬁfth of each immunoprecipitate was removed and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the M5 mAb . RESULTS Graf regulation of actin polymerization We have previously shown that Graf stimulates GTPase activity of both Cdc42 and Rho in vitro ( Hildebrand et al . , 1996 ) . To determine whether Graf exhibited a preference in vivo for one of these GTPases we examined the morphology of Swiss 3T3 cells upon microinjection of Graf cDNA . Previous studies have shown that microinjection of each of these smw G proteins has profound effects on the cytoskeletal organization of cells ; Cdc42 stimulates ﬁlopodial extensions whereas Rho stimulates the formation of stress ﬁbers . Microinjection of Graf cDNA into Swiss 3T3 cells ( in the presence of serum ) caused clearing of stress ﬁbers followed by formation of long actin based ﬁlopodial - like extensions ( Fig . 1A - F ) . The percentage of F - Graf - injected cells that exhibited the extended phenotype ( as assessed by co - injecting green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) cDNA and scoring for GFP ﬂuorescence ) was approximately 57 % ( Fig . 3C ) . When cells were injected with F - Graf in the absence of GFP and injected cells were scored by anti - Flag staining , the percentage of cells exhibiting Graf induced cytoskeletal changes was 76 % . A similar phenotype was observed when Graf was overexpressed in other ﬁbroblasts including REF 52 and 10T1 / 2 cells ( data not shown ) . We microinjected cDNAs encoding activated Rho , C3 ( a Rho - inhibitor ) and the activated and dominant - negative forms of Cdc42 and Rac into growing Swiss cells to determine which of these constructs could mimic the effects of Graf microinjection . Microinjection of activated Cdc42 ( L61 ) caused the formation of small microspikes ( data not shown ) , an effect similar to , although not as robust as , what has been previously reported following microinjection of activated Cdc42 in quiescent cells . The Cdc42 ( L61 ) induced microspikes are distinct from the much broader and larger extensions we observed after microinjection of Graf into Swiss 3T3 cells . Microinjection of the dominant - negative Cdc42 ( N17 ) , activated or dominant negative Rac ( L61 or N17 ) and activated Rho ( L63 ) into the growing cells had little , if any , effect on overall cellular structure as assessed by ﬂuorescein - phalloidin staining ( data not shown ) . However , an increase in stress ﬁbers was observed upon microinjection of the activated Rac ( L61 ) and Rho ( L63 ) constructs ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , inhibition of Rho activity by microinjection of the C3 exoenzyme resulted in phenotypes similar to those observed following injection of Graf cDNA . Microinjection of C3 caused clearing of stress ﬁbers followed by formation of long actin based ﬁlopodial - like extensions ( Fig . 1G and H ) . These data suggest that Graf , like C3 , downregulates Rho activity which , in turn , stimulates ( or stabilizes ) cellular ﬁlopodial - like extensions in growing cells . To investigate the dynamics of the Graf - mediated ﬁlopodial extensions , cells were monitored by video microscopy following microinjection . As shown in Fig . 2 , the extended ﬁlopodial - like extensions induced by Graf injection resulted from the continuous formation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodial - like structures and was not due to mere contraction of the cell body . The Graf - induced projections grew continuously up to 4 hours post - injection . Interestingly , immunoﬂuorescent staining of the Graf injected cells indicates that Graf is localized in punctate structures along the protruding actin - based extensions ( Fig . 1E - F ) . To conﬁrm that the effect of Graf on Swiss 3T3 morphology was dependent on its ability to act as a GTPase activating protein , we examined the effects of Graf domain deletion mutations . Graf contains a centrally located GAP domain followed by a Ser / Pro rich domain and a carboxy - terminal SH3 domain ( Fig . 3 ) . Microinjection of wild - type Graf protein ( F - Graf ; 50 ng / m l ) or a construct containing the GAP domain without the SH3 domain ( F - GAP ; 50 ng / m l ) along with GFP ( 5 ng / m l ) resulted in ﬁlopodial - like extensions in approximately 57 % and 55 % of GFP - expressing cells , respectively . In contrast , microinjection of the amino - terminal ( F - NT ) or SH3 ( F - SH3 ) domains with GFP had no effect on cellular morphology ( Fig . 3C ) . As observed in Fig . 3B , overexpression of F - Graf results in the production of two protein bands . Previous experiments have shown that the slower migrating band results from phosphorylation of Ser 510 by p42 mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase ( Taylor et al . , 1998b ) . To determine whether phosphorylation of this site modulates the Graf - mediated cytoskeletal changes of Swiss 3T3 cells , we microinjected F - Graf with a point mutation ( S510A ) which prevents the in vivo 234 phosphorylation of Graf . Microinjection of this mutant resulted in the extended phenotype in 51 % of GFP - expressing cells ( as scored in 5 separate experiments ) , suggesting that phosphorylation does not signiﬁcantly affect the GAP activity of Graf ( data not shown ) . To conﬁrm that GAP activity is required for the Graf - mediated cytoskeletal changes , we created point mutations in the GAP domain which rendered Graf enzymatically inactive . Sequence alignment of the Rho - GAP family members reveals that nine residues within the GAP domain of known Rho - GAPs are completely conserved ( Fig . 4A ; Barrett et al . , 1997 ) . In light of recent evidence provided by the crystal structure of the p50 Rho - GAP , we chose to individually mutate two conserved residues within the GAP domain of Graf which form part of a hydrophilic core in p50 Rho - GAP . In co - crystals of Cdc42 and p50RhoGAP , amino acid R85 in p50RhoGAP ( R236 in Graf ) was shown to make direct contacts with Gly12 of Cdc42 and has been proposed to stabilize a transition state of the GTP - bound Cdc42 ( Barrett et al . , 1997 ; Rittenger et al . , 1997 ) . Other Rho - GAP residues which made contacts with the switch 1 region of Cdc42 include Lys 189 , Thr 191 and Asn 194 ( Lys 346 , Thr 348 and J . M . Taylor , M . M . Macklem and J . T . Parsons Fig . 1 . Effect of Graf and C3 on actin reorganization in Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts . Subconﬂuent swiss 3T3 cells ( 5 · 10 4 cells / 35 mm dish ) plated in the presence of serum were injected with Graf cDNA in a Flag - tagged expression vector ( pCDNA3 , 50 ng / m l ) or C3 cDNA ( in pEF , 50 ng / m l ) . ( A - D , G , H ) Cells were co - injected with GFP cDNA ( 5 ng / m l ) to detect injected cells . ( A , B , G ) Microinjected cells were cultured for 1 hour prior to ﬁxation , ( C , D , E , F , H ) injected cells were cultured for 3 hours prior to ﬁxation . Cells were ﬁxed and stained as described in Materials and Methods . Graf injected cells were visualized by GFP ﬂuorescence ( A and C ) and phalloidin staining ( B and D ) or anti - Flag antibody ( E and F ) . ( G and H ) C3 injected cells visualized by phalloidin staining . Injected cells are indicated by the arrows , un - injected neighboring control cells are denoted by asterisks . 235 Graf regulates Rho signaling Asn 351 in Graf ; Rittenger et al . , 1997 ) . Of these , only Asn 194 is conserved among the Rho - GAPs with the exception of p85 PI3 kinase which contains Val at this position and has a non - functional GAP domain . We therefore mutated Arg 236 in Graf to Gln and Asn 351 to Val in an attempt to create a GAP - deﬁcient Graf . The R236Q and N351V mutants were catalytically inactive failing to enhance GTPase activity of Rho protein in vitro ( data not shown ) . In addition , microinjection of the R236Q and N351V Graf mutants failed to induce cellular extensions ( Figs 4 and 5 ) indicating that GAP activity is required for this effect . To rule out dosage effects , these cDNA constructs were injected at concentrations of up to 200 m g / ml with no effect on cell morphology ( data not shown ) . To more precisely determine which of the Rho family of small G protein ( s ) is regulated by Graf , we examined the ability of Graf to block SPP - mediated Rho - induced stress ﬁber formation and bradykinin - mediated Cdc42 - induced microspike formation in serum starved Swiss 3T3 cells . Serum starvation leads to a loss of stress ﬁbers , lamellipodia and membrane ruffles presumably due to a down - regulation of the Rho - related G proteins in these cells ( Fig . 6A ; Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . Microinjection of Graf cDNA into serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells did not signiﬁcantly alter cellular morphology within 4 hours ( data not shown ) . A 30 minute treatment with SPP induced stress ﬁber formation in nearly all of the quiescent cells ( Fig . 6B ) . As shown in Fig . 6C - F , Graf - expression blocked the SPP - induced re - organization of actin into stress ﬁbers . In some Graf injected cells , SPP enhanced F - actin staining , as observed by the relatively intense staining of arc - like structures of polymerized actin , but these actin - rich ﬁlaments did not assemble into stress - ﬁbers . In accordance with these data , injection of activated ( L63 ) Rho along with FGraf in serum containing Swiss 3T3 cells resulted in the extended phenotype in less then 5 % of the injected cells , indicating that Rho reversed the effects induced by Graf ( data not shown ) . To investigate the effects of Graf expression on bradykinin - induced microspikes , we injected N17Rac cDNA to block endogenous Rac activity prior to treatment with bradykinin ( Fig . 7A and B ) . Since activation of Cdc42 leads to activation of Rac followed by Rho in these cells , N17Rac provides a means to block the activation of downstream G proteins and their subsequent effects on actin polymerization ( compare the bradykinin - induced microspikes in the N17Rac injected cells in Fig . 7B vs the bradykinin - induced stress ﬁbers in the uninjected cells in Fig . 7D and F ) . When Graf cDNA and N17Rac cDNA were coinjected into the quiescent cells and the cells were treated with bradykinin , the cells produced numerous microspikes indicating that Graf expression does not block Cdc42 signaling ( Fig . 7C - F ) . These data indicate that Graf can block Rho - induced assembly of stress ﬁbers , but not Cdc42 - induced ﬁlopodia . To further substantiate the speciﬁcity of Graf as a GAP for Rho in vivo , we examined the effect of Graf over - expression Fig . 2 . Time - lapse images of subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells injected with Graf cDNA . Subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells ( 5 · 10 4 cells / 35 mm dish ) plated in the presence of serum were microinjected with F - Graf cDNA ( 50 m g / ml ; top cell ) or buffer control ( bottom cell ) as described above . Cells were photographed using video microscopy over a 4 hour period and selected frames were captured using the ISee computer imaging program . The development of the stable ﬁlopodial projections are indicated by arrows . This cell is representative of cells observed in 6 separate experiments . 236 in PC12 cells which typically express relatively high levels of endogenous Graf . Previous reports have shown that expression of C3 or the dominant - interfering mutant for Rho ( N19 ) induces neurite outgrowth in these cells ( Jalink et al . , 1994 ; Gebbink et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , activation of Rho ( by SPP or LPA ) in both NGF - differentiated PC12 cells and NIE - 115 cells induces neurite retraction and cell rounding ( Postma et al . , 1996 ; Tigyi et al . , 1996 ) . Unlike C3 and N19Rho , expression of GFP - Graf was not sufficient to stimulate neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells ( data not shown ) . To examine the effect of Graf overexpression on Rho - mediated neurite retraction , PC12 cells were transfected with GFP - Graf and treated with NGF for 72 hours . Under these conditions , neurite outgrowth was observed in a signiﬁcant percentage of GFP - Graf expressing cells ( data not shown ) . Fig . 8A and B show that SPP - induced neurite retraction is not blocked in PC12 cells overexpressing GFP - Graf . In fact , the GFP - Graf expressing cells actually appear to have an enhanced rate of SPP - induced neurite retraction compared to control cells . Neurites from GFP - Graf expressing cells retract as early as 6 minutes after application of SPP , whereas adjacent control cells require 20 minutes for a similar extent of retraction . In cells expressing GFP - Graf R236Q the rate of SPP - induced neurite retraction appeared similar to , if not slower than , neurite retraction in adjacent control cells ( Fig . 8C and D ) . These data indicate that the Graf - mediated response is dependant on GAP activity and indicate the possibility that Graf may be an effector for Rho in certain cell types . DISCUSSION We previously reported that Graf has GAP activity for Rho A and Cdc42 in vitro but not Rac1 or Ras ( Hildebrand et al . , 1996 ) . In this study we show that Graf speciﬁcally down - regulates Rho activity in vivo . Microinjection of Graf cDNA ( or cDNA for the Rho - inhibitor C3 ) into subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells , in the presence of serum , causes clearing of stress ﬁbers followed by formation of long actin based ﬁlopodial - like extensions . In contrast , microinjection of Graf cDNA containing mutations in the GAP domain which render the protein enzymatically inactive have no effect on cellular morphology . Using serum starved Swiss 3T3 cells ( in which Rho is down - regulated ) we have shown that Graf blocks SPP stimulated ( Rho - mediated ) stress ﬁber formation , but not bradykinin stimulated ( Cdc42 - mediated ) ﬁlopodial extensions . Although puriﬁed Graf can accelerate the GTP hydrolysis of J . M . Taylor , M . M . Macklem and J . T . Parsons Fig . 3 . Filopodial extensions in cells expressing Graf deletion variants . ( A ) A schematic representation of the N - terminal Flag epitope - tagged Graf variants . F - Graf contains amino acids 1 - 584 ; F - NT contains amino acids 1 - 241 ; F - GAP contains amino acids 1 - 422 ; and F - SH3 contains amino acids 472 - 584 . ( B ) F - Graf and the deletion variants were expressed in COS - 1 cells as described in Materials and Methods . F - Graf transfected cells ( left ) were treated with vehicle ( C ) or 100 ng / ml EGF for 10 minutes prior to boiling in sample buffer . Equal volumes of cell lysate were analyzed by 10 % ( left ) or 12 % ( right ) SDS - PAGE and western blotting using the M5 Flag - speciﬁc Ab as described in Materials and Methods . ( C ) Subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with either F - Graf , F - NT , F - GAP or F - SH3 cDNA ( 50 ng / m l ) in the presence of GFP cDNA ( 5 ng / m l ) . The cells were cultured in serum containing medium for 3 hours prior to ﬁxation and incubation with Texas Red conjugated phalloidin to visualize ﬁlamentous actin . The data are presented as the percentage of injected cells ( as assessed by GFP ﬂuorescence ) that exhibit the extended phenotype . The number of GFP - expressing cells for each construct was : F - Graf , 137 cells in 7 separate experiments ; F - NT , 57 cells in 2 separate experiments ; F - GAP , 95 cells in 5 separate experiments and F - SH3 , 63 cells in 3 separate experiments . 237 Graf regulates Rho signaling both Cdc42 and Rho in vitro , our observations clearly show that Graf exhibits speciﬁcity for Rho - mediated signaling in vivo . The ﬁlopodial extensions observed following microinjection of either Graf or C3 into Swiss 3T3 cells are likely due to inactivation of Rho GTPase activity and the subsequent un - opposed activation of Cdc42 and Rac . Since in these experiments the cells are cultured in complete medium containing serum , the initial activation of Cdc42 and Rac could be due to activating factors in the serum , or to positive feedback signaling resulting from downregulation of Rho . The later has been suggested to occur in the NIE - 115 neuroblastoma cells whereby in serum starved cells , C3 - mediated neurite outgrowth was inhibited by either dominant negative Cdc42 ( T17N ) or Rac ( T17N ) ( Kozma et al . , 1997 ) . This apparent feedback signaling may be due to the disruption of the balance among the regulatory factors of these smw G proteins . The rate of conversion between the GDP - bound form and GTP bound form of smw G proteins is modulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) which inhibit GDP dissociation , guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) which stimulate the replacement of GDP by GTP , and by GAPs which stimulate the rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by the GTPase . Thus , Graf , by virtue of it being a GTPase activator for Rho would be expected to increase the level of GDP bound Rho and thus increase the amount of Rho available for binding to the Rho GDI . Since Rho GDI binds indiscriminately to Rho , Cdc42 and Rac , the equilibrium of GDI - bound Cdc42 and Rac could be shifted to favor release of these proteins from the GDI and subsequent activation by their respective guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Boguski and McCormick , 1993 ) . The speciﬁcity of Graf as a GAP for Rho , but not Cdc42 is intriguing , in light of the ability of Graf to enhance the rate of GTP hydrolysis for both smw G proteins in vitro ( Hildebrand et al . , 1996 ) . The data supporting the conclusion that Graf is a Rho - speciﬁc GAP include the similar phenotypes observed after Graf and C3 injection into serum - containing Swiss 3T3 cells , and the ability of Graf to block SPP stimulated stress ﬁbers , but not bradykinin stimulated actin projections . SPP signals through the recently identiﬁed EDG - 1 receptor , a heterotrimeric G - protein coupled receptor which is linked ( by a poorly understood mechanism ) to Rho activation and Rho - dependent formation of stress ﬁbers and focal adhesions ( Lee et al . , 1998 ) . SPP treatment has also been shown to transiently increase the total F - actin pool in starved cells although this ‘pool’ is not readily incorporated into stress ﬁbers ( Machesky and Hall , 1997 ) . We show here that in the presence of Graf , SPP induces an increase in actin staining without the bundling of these ﬁlaments into stress ﬁbers . Interestingly , a recent report showed that LPA - stimulated ( Rho - mediated ) stress ﬁber formation was inhibited by the contraction inhibitor , 2 , 3 - butanedione 2 - monoxime , whereas LPA - induced actin Fig . 4 . Filopodial extensions in cells expressing catalytically inactive Graf . ( A ) The sequence alignment of the GAP domains of Graf , p50RhoGap , and p85 PI3Kinase ( p85 ) is shown . The nine conserved residues within the GAP domain of known Rho - GAPs are indicated in shaded boxes . The mutations introduced into the GAP domain are indicated by asterisks ( residues R236 and N351 in Graf ) . ( B ) F - Graf , or F - Graf ( R236Q ) or N351V were expressed in COS - 1 cells as described in Materials and Methods . Cells were lysed in sample buffer analyzed by 10 % SDS - PAGE and western blotting using the M5 Flag - speciﬁc Ab as described in Materials and Methods . ( C ) Subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with either F - Graf , R236Q or N351V cDNA ( 50 ng / m l ) along with GFP cDNA ( 5 ng / m l ) . The cells were incubated for 3 hours prior to ﬁxation and incubation with Texas Red conjugated phalloidin to visualize ﬁlamentous actin . The data are presented as the percentage of injected cells ( as assessed by GFP ﬂuorescence ) that exhibit the extended phenotype . The number of GFP - expressing cells for each construct was : F - Graf , 69 cells in 3 separate experiments ; R236Q , 67 cells in 5 separate experiments and N351V , 77 cells in 4 separate experiments . 238 polymerization was unaffected by this inhibitor ( Chrzanowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ) . These data led the authors to propose that Rho regulates the actin cytoskeleton by two synergistic pathways ; one involving a kinase cascade resulting in contraction and stress ﬁber formation and the other possibly involving activation of PIP2 leading to actin polymerization ( Chrzanowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ) . Due to the divergent sensitivity of these endpoints to Graf , our data suggest that the kinase / contractility pathway is dependent on active ( GTP bound ) Rho , whereas the PIP2 / actin polymerization pathway is not . The candidate kinases which could be involved in Rho - mediated stress ﬁber formation include protein kinase N , PRK2 kinase and a family of RhoA binding kinases termed p160ROK a ( rat homologue ) or ROCK ( mouse homologue ) , or p164 Rho kinase ( bovine homologue ) . Microinjection studies have revealed that both ROK a and PRK2 can affect Rho - dependent stress ﬁber formation , suggesting that these kinases phosphorylate substrates which mediate the Rho - dependent effects on actin rearrangement ( Vincent and Settleman , 1997 ; Amano et al . , 1997 ) . Interestingly , a substrate for the Rho - stimulated kinase , ROCK is the myosin - binding , regulatory subunit of the myosin phosphatase PP1 - M . Phosphorylation of PPI - M by ROCK inactivates the phosphatase and in turn enhances myosin - light chain phosphorylation , an effect that stimulates actin - myosin mediated contraction ( Amano et al . , 1996a ; Kimura et al . , 1996 ) . Since the formation of focal adhesions and stress ﬁbers has been linked to actin - myosin contractility , ROCK J . M . Taylor , M . M . Macklem and J . T . Parsons Fig . 5 . Morphology of cells expressing Graf GAP domain variants . Subconﬂuent Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with either F - GAP ( 50 ng / m l ; coinjected with 5 ng / m l GFP , A and B ) , R236Q ( 50 ng / m l ; C and D ) or N351V cDNA ( 50 ng / m l ; E and F ) . The cells were cultured for 3 hours prior to ﬁxation and staining . The injected cells were visualized by either GFP ﬂuorescence ( A ) or with an anti - Flag antibody ( C and E ) as described in Materials and Methods . Filamentous actin was visualized with ﬂuorescently tagged phalloidin ( B , D , F ) . Injected cells are indicated by the arrows , un - injected neighboring control cells are denoted by asterisks . 239 Graf regulates Rho signaling could be also be involved in mediating the effects of Rho on the cytoskeleton ( Burridge and Chrzanowska - Wodnicka , 1996 ) . To date , the only candidate protein proposed to be involved in Rho - stimulated actin polymerization is the lipid kinase , phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate - 5 - kinase , PIP5 - K which converts phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate ( PIP ) to PIP2 ( Ren et al . , 1996 ) . The ability of PIP2 to bind and regulate several actin binding proteins including those involved in ﬁlament capping , cross - linking and severing ( Gilmore and Burridge , 1996 ; Fukami et al . , 1992 ; Hirao et al . , 1996 ; Lassing and Lindberg , 1985 ) suggests that the synthesis of PIP2 may be a critical regulatory step in Rho - mediated actin polymerization and assembly of stress ﬁbers and focal adhesions . Interestingly , Rho binds to and stimulates PIP5 - K in a GTP independent fashion ( Ren et al . , 1996 ) , consistent with the lack of effect of Graf on this cellular process . In contrast to the results in Swiss 3T3 cells , we show that Graf appears to enhance SPP - induced Rho - mediated effects in PC12 cells . Evidence using NGF - differentiated PC12 cells and other neuroblastoma cells ( NIE - 115 and NG108 ) indicates that the Rho family members control the actin - based axonal extensions within the growth cones of these cells . Activation of Rac and Cdc42 has been shown to promote the formation of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia along the neurite extensions in NIE - 115 cells ( Kozma et al . , 1997 ) . Activation of Rho in both NGF - differentiated PC12 cells and NIE - 115 cells induces neurite retraction and cell rounding ( an effect that is mediated by Rho - kinase ) ( Postma et al . , 1996 ; Tigyi et al . , 1996 ; Katoh et al . , 1998 ) . Since Graf blocked SPP - induced stress ﬁber formation in Swiss 3T3 cells , we predicted that Fig . 6 . Graf inhibits SPP induced Rho - mediated stress ﬁber formation in serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells . Serum starved quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells , either uninjected controls ( A and B ) or cells microinjected with 200 m g / ml Graf cDNA ( in PRK5 - myc ; C - F ) , were cultured for 4 hours prior to treatment with vehicle ( A ) or 5 m M SPP ( B - F ) for 30 minutes . Injected cells were visualized using an anti - myc antibody ( 9E10 ) as described in Materials and Methods ( C and E ) . Filamentous actin was visualized with ﬂuorescently tagged phalloidin ( A , B , D ) . Injected cells are indicated by the arrows , un - injected neighboring control cells are denoted by asterisks . The phenotype shown was observed in 35 / 46 myc - positive cells . 240 overexpression of Graf in NGF - differentiated PC12 cells would attenuate SPP - induced neurite retraction . Somewhat suprisingly , we found that overexpression of Graf enhanced the apparent rate of Rho - mediated neurite retraction in PC12 cells . In cells expressing the GAP - deﬁcient R236Q mutant , neurite retraction was virtually indistinguishable from control cells . One might expect that relatively high levels of expression of the R236Q mutant would be sufficient to have a dominant - interfering effect on endogenous Graf signaling and therefore block neurite retraction . However , such levels may not be consistently maintained in transfected PC12 cells at the time point at which experiments were carried out ( 96 hours after transfection ) . Nonetheless , these data are consistent with the requirement for GAP activity for Graf - mediated increases in neurite retraction and suggest that Graf may act to transmit rather than inhibit Rho signaling in PC12 cells . Several GAP proteins including p120Ras GAP , n - chimaerin , PLC b and the g subunit of phosphodiesterase have been shown to transmit signals down - stream of their respective G proteins ( Duchesne et al . , 1993 ; Boguski and McCormick , 1993 ; Kozma et al . , 1996 ) . In the case of p120Ras GAP this signal may involve targeting other signaling molecules to Ras via protein - interactions directed by the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of RasGAP . Evidence supporting this hypothesis include the ability of a monoclonal antibody which was found to recognize the SH3 domain in RasGAP and synthetic peptides corresponding to this region to block activated Ras ( K12 ) induced germinal vesicle breakdown in Xenopus oocytes ( Duchesne et al . , 1993 ) . Presumably , p120Ras GAP is directed to an additional binding partner ( s ) upon binding GTP - Ras . Thus it is possible that Graf , like p120Ras GAP , transmits downstream signals through SH3 domain - mediated protein interactions . J . M . Taylor , M . M . Macklem and J . T . Parsons Fig . 7 . Graf does not block bradykinin induced Cdc42 - mediated microspikes in serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells . Serum starved quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells microinjected with 200 m g / ml N17Rac cDNA ( in PRK5 - myc ) in the absence ( A and B ) or presence of 200 m g / ml Graf cDNA ( in PRK5 - myc ; C - F ) . The cells were cultured for 4 hours prior to treatment with 100 ng / ml bradykinin ( B , E - H ) for 15 minutes . Injected cells were visualized using an anti - myc antibody ( 9E10 ) as described in Materials and Methods ( A , C , E ) . Filamentous actin was visualized with ﬂuorescently tagged phalloidin ( B , D , F ) . Injected cells are indicated by the arrows , un - injected neighboring control cells are denoted by asterisks . The phenotypes shown were observed in 24 / 30 myc - positive N17Rac injected cells and 33 / 42 myc - positive cells coinjected with N17Rac and Graf . 241 Graf regulates Rho signaling The data presented in this paper indicate that Graf speciﬁcally regulates Rho activity in vivo . We have shown that Graf downregulates Rho activity in Swiss 3T3 cells but apparently enhances Rho - dependent effects in PC12 cells . The ability of Graf to be a signal terminator in Swiss 3T3 cells but a signal transmitter in PC12 cells could be due to the different levels of endogenous Graf protein ( and Graf binding partners ) in these cell lines . We have previously shown that Graf is not expressed at detectable levels in Swiss 3T3 cells ( or other ﬁbroblasts ) but is highly expressed in PC12 cells ( Taylor et al . , 1998b ) . Since the ability of Graf to act as a signal transducer is likely due to protein - protein interactions , it is possible that the down - stream target for Graf in PC12 cells is also lacking in Swiss 3T3 cells . Thus , in Swiss 3T3 cells ectopic expression of Graf merely inactivates Rho and does not transmit further signaling . Since Graf is enriched in the brain , and appears to regulate Rho - mediated neurite retraction , Graf may play an important role in neuronal cell morphology . However , further investigation is required to deﬁne the precise role of Graf in this context .
