Aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID - 19 pandemic on hospital admissions among children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years over three waves of COVID - 19 ( from February 2020 to May 2021 ) in Piedmont , a large Italian region , and to investigate the possible determinants of hospitalizations .

Subjects Epidemiology , Infectious Diseases , Pediatrics , Public Health , COVID - 19 Keywords Hospitalization , Children , Adolescent , COVID - 19 , Determinants INTRODUCTION After a pneumonia outbreak in late 2019 in the region of Wuhan ( China ) , a new virus related to the Coronaviridae strain , called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , was identi ﬁ ed as the pathogen of an emerging disease known as COronaVIrus Disease 19 ( COVID - 19 ) ( Wu et al . , 2020 ) . On 11th March 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared worldwide a pandemic health emergency ( WHO Director - General , 2020 ) , and 11 , 538 cases and 619 deaths had already been reported in Italy on that day . The overall mortality rate was 5 . 4 % , affecting exclusively the older age groups . Among children and adolescents ( 0 – 18 ) just 1 . 2 % of cases and no deaths were registered . Most cases occurred in Northern Italy and Piedmont was the ﬁ fth region with the highest prevalence ( Epicentro — Istituto Superiore di Sanità , 2020 ) . Preliminary evidence outlines a higher prevalence ( i . e . , sero - prevalence ) in adults and lower susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 especially in children . According to several studies carried out during the ﬁ rst outbreak in 2020 , chain of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from parents to children namely from household contacts seem to be predominant . Although children are not likely to be super - spreader , as usually happens for viral respiratory epidemics , the secondary role of youth in viral transmission remains vague ( Viner et al . , 2021 ; Armann et al . , 2020 ) . The quick viral spread and its rapid genomic mutation have allowed the diffusion of several variants , like Delta variant ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) , whose higher transmission rates and shorter average incubation period are probably the concurrent causes of the rising infection within younger age groups . Additionally , the increasing vaccination coverage in older adults has driven disease transmission further among children and adolescents ( Howard - Jones et al . , 2022 ) . The latest data showed that a minority of children requires hospital admission or intensive care admission ; nevertheless , this may change whether new variants emerge . Accordingly , recent epidemiologic research highlighted that transmissibility and susceptibility among children and adolescents become higher due to new virus variants ( Chen et al . , 2022 ; Zimmermann et al . , 2022 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 infections among youth arises similarly to other common viral infections , with a wide range of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and malaise . Critical illness affects mostly new - borns , and children and adolescents with underlying medical conditions ( i . e . , obesity , diabetes , asthma , cancer ) . The severity of disease is associated with high rate of hospitalization and possibly Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) admission due to serious pulmonary and extra - pulmonary symptoms . Complications are rare , especially in healthy children and complications , which require intensive care support , consist in acute lung injury that usually occurs 1 – 2 weeks after early manifestation , whereas Martella et al . ( 2023 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 15492 2 / 14 cardiovascular , gastrointestinal and neurological involvement are peculiar for MIS - C and follow the symptom onset in 4 – 6 weeks ( Howard - Jones et al . , 2022 ; Hoste , Van Paemel & Haerynck , 2021 ; Esposito et al . , 2021 ) . Several studies have been carried out on hospitalizations associated with COVID - 19 among children and adolescents aged 0 – 17 years in different pandemic periods and multiple countries ( Siegel et al . , 2021 ; Delahoy , 2021 ) . However , little is known about the trend of children admissions during three waves of COVID - 19 in the Italian health system and at our knowledge , there are not studies regarding the determinants of children admissions . The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID - 19 pandemic on hospital admissions among children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years in Piedmont during the timespan February 2020 - May 2021 and to investigate the determinants of hospitalizations . MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross - sectional time series analysis was carried out over a period of 16 months , from February 2020 to May 2021 , in the Piedmont Region , which is the second largest region in Italy , with a population of more than 4 million inhabitants over an area of 25 , 387 km 2 ( ISTAT , 2022 ) . The period from February 2020 to May 2021 covers three waves of COVID - 19 . Selection of hospital admissions with COVID - 19 diagnosis code in Piedmont among people aged from 0 to 17 years and extraction of pertaining data were performed . The following variables were collected : sex , age ( grouped as 0 – 4 , 5 – 11 , 12 – 17 ) , nationality ( Italy , EU countries , Extra - EU countries ) ; date of hospital admission ( month and year ) , length of stay ( LOS ) , provenience of patient ( Emergency Department — ED , general practitioner , other hospital , wards of the same hospital , others ) and destination after discharge ( other hospital , home , died ) . The “ wards of the same hospital ” referred to intra - hospital transfers from neonatology unit after birth or after scheduled hospitalizations in other wards . These data were collected from patients ’ hospital discharge database ( SDO database ) . Data were extracted from the Health Information System of the Piedmont Region , in accordance with regulations of protection of personal data in force ; exclusively delegates belonging to the Regional Epidemiology Network are in charge to download and process data . The Regional Epidemiology Network provides for digital collection of health data coming from different sources through such Health Information System , in support to epidemiological surveillance activities and assessment of population health status and evaluation of needs of the community . The Unit of Epidemiology - regional Health Service of the Local Health Board TO3 is a node of the network and stipulated a formal agreement between the units involved in this study , also for research purposes . The platform COVID - Stat ( National Institute for Nuclear Physics , 2022 ) from the National Institute for Nuclear Physics ( INFN ) provided daily data of hospitalizations reported in Italy , from end of January 2020 until now . Martella et al . ( 2023 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 15492 3 / 14 Aggregate data , for the entire Italian population of all ages , and strati ﬁ ed ones , for region and for age , were downloaded from the platform as Comma - Separated Values ( CSV ) ﬁ les to create tables and graphics . Data analysis focused on computing monthly hospitalizations among overall population resident in Piedmont , monthly hospitalizations for people aged 0 – 17 and related age - groups ( 0 – 4 ; 5 – 11 and 12 – 17 ) resident in Piedmont , as well . Additionally , hospitalization rate was calculated as number of monthly ( overall or age speci ﬁ c ) hospitalizations divided by yearly ( overall or age speci ﬁ c ) population in Piedmont per 100 , 000 . Following trends were compared : overall and age - grouped number of paediatric hospitalizations , overall and age - grouped paediatric hospitalization rates , as well . Further , a comparison between number of hospitalizations and hospitalization rates among general population and among people aged 0 – 17 was evaluated . Data source of the census of population updated to the 1st January 2020 and to the 1st January 2021 , including nationality , was the of ﬁ cial platform of the Italian Institute of Statistics ( ISTAT ) ( ISTAT , 2021a , 2021b ) . Statistical analysis A meta - analysis for risk assessment was performed to assess the odds of hospitalizations across selected independent factors , namely sex , nationality ( Italian and Foreign - EU / extra - EU ) and age groups , over the 16 - month study period ( European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2021 ) . The R framework ( R Core Team , 2013 ) was used to perform all analyses and the signi ﬁ cance level was set at p < 0 . 05 for all analyses . RESULTS Descriptive analysis of the sample Data from 442 paediatric patients recorded under COVID - 19 diagnosis code were collected during the period February 2020 and May 2021 . Most of patients aged from 0 to 4 years ( 60 . 2 % ) , whereas 20 . 4 % and 19 . 4 % belonged to the age groups 12 – 17 and 5 – 11 years , respectively , the mean age was 5 . 03 ( SD 5 . 74 ) . Patients were predominantly males ( 58 . 6 % ) and 77 . 1 % of patients were Italian . More than half of hospitalizations occurred during 2020 ( 55 . 6 % ) . The mean LOS was 5 . 3 ( SD 5 . 4 ) days . Admission of 280 patients ( 63 . 3 % ) occurred through the ED . Provenience from the other hospitals represented the 16 . 7 % of admissions . In addition , 7 % were intra - hospital transfers ( from neonatology unit after birth or by scheduled hospitalization ) , whereas 7 . 2 % of patients got access through request from general practitioner ( GP ) or other specialist . Places of discharge were mostly home ( 92 . 3 % ) and only 7 % was discharged to other healthcare setting . Finally , three patients ( 0 . 7 % ) died ( Table 1 ) . Figure 1A shows a slight increase of paediatric admissions already in March 2020 ; afterwards , hospitalizations settled around very few events until September 2020 . In the second half of monitoring period – second and third wave — a dramatic rise of cases was reported in November 2020 and in March 2021 . Martella et al . ( 2023 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 15492 4 / 14 Comparing paediatric data with the admission data of all Piedmont population , spikes match and a similar tendency is outlined ( Fig . 2A ) . Children and adolescent account for 0 . 1 % to 2 . 3 % of reported COVID admissions across Piedmont region . The percentage increases from the ﬁ rst wave ( 0 . 7 % ) to the second wave ( 1 . 5 % ) to the third wave ( 1 . 8 % ) . Paediatric age - grouped hospitalizations ( 0 – 4 ; 12 – 17 ; 5 – 11 ) reproduced an analogous trend . Monthly hospitalization rate ( per 100 , 000 ) of children and adolescents aged 0 – 17 years reproduced the increasing trend of hospitalization numbers ( Fig . 2A ) . This trend was in ﬂ uenced , in particular , by the trend of hospitalization rates for children aged 0 – 4 years . Lower rates were observed for adolescents ( 12 – 17 years ) , for whom hospital admission incidence remained stable under 10 hospitalizations for 100 , 000 between October 2020 Table 1 Patient ’ s characteristics .

Martella et al . ( 2023 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 15492 5 / 14 and April 2021 ( Fig . 1B ) . The cumulative hospitalization rates over the studied period were 181 . 83 , 34 . 37 and 38 . 8 for 0 – 4 , 5 – 11 and 12 – 17 respectively . The children and adolescent hospitalization rate appeared lower than overall population with a moderate slope of increase in comparison with population slope ( Fig . 2B ) . The meta - analysis for risk assessment , reported in Table 2 , showed a decreased likelihood of rescue of hospitalizations in female ( Odds Ratio — OR 0 . 75 , p - value < 0 . 001 ) , 5 – 11 and 12 – 17 age groups ( OR 0 . 19 and OR 0 . 22 , p - value < 0 . 001 respectively ) .

DISCUSSION The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID - 19 pandemic on hospital admissions among children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years in Piedmont during the timespan February 2020 - May 2021 and to investigate the determinants of hospitalizations .

( 2023 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 15492 7 / 14 The results highlighted that , during the observed period , absolute number of admissions for COVID - 19 for children and adolescents in Piedmont showed a ﬂ uctuating trend with peaks at the three waves , and consistently similar to distribution reported among all ages in the whole region during the same timeframe . The percentage of paediatric admissions out of the total hospitalizations of the whole population increased from the ﬁ rst to third wave . One possible explanation could be the beginning of the COVID - 19 vaccines administration ( May 2021 for children aged 12 years onward and November 2021 for children aged from 5 to 11 years ) that involved the elderly population leaving the younger population with no protection . Trend of hospitalizations and admission rates respectively showed a gradual decrease after March 2020 , as a consequence of implementation of containment restrictions and drastic preventive actions , such as quarantine , school closure and social restriction ( Camera dei deputati - Documentazione parlamentare , 2022 ) . From April 2020 to July 2020 , age - speci ﬁ c ( 0 – 17 ) hospitalization rate decreased from 2 . 53 to 0 . 16 admission per 100 , 000 , remaining under one admission per 100 , 000 till October 2020 . These data re ﬂ ect the ﬂ attening of the curve of the COVID - 19 case noti ﬁ cation rate reported from the European surveillance system ( TESSy ) for all age groups ( European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2021 ) . The increases in COVID - 19 hospital admissions found in this study occurred for all assessed paediatric age groups during the three waves , with most admissions among patients aged ≤ 4 and 5 – 11 years . This bimodal age distribution is only partially consistent with other published data ( Siegel et al . , 2021 ; Kainth et al . , 2020 ) that showed a different bimodal age distribution : 0 – 4 and 12 – 17 . The strong presence of hospitalizations for children of 0 – 4 years is however , a recurring result in the literature . To con ﬁ rm the mentioned studies , a national survey conducted by the German Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases highlighted a high proportion of infants admissions : among 128 inpatients , 37 % of them were infants and 29 % were 1 to 5 years old ( Armann et al . , 2020 ) . Table 2 Odds Ratios and 95 % con ﬁ dence interval ( 95 % CI ) of hospitalizations across selected independent factors ( sex , nationality and age ) over the 16 - month study period . OR 95 % CI p - value Age group 0 – 4 1 5 – 11 0 . 19 [ 0 . 15 – 0 . 24 ] p < 0 . 001 12 – 17 0 . 22 [ 0 . 17 – 0 . 28 ] Gender Male 1 Female 0 . 75 [ 0 . 62 – 0 . 9 ] p < 0 . 001 Nationality Italian 1 Foreign ( EU and Extra - UE ) 1 . 83 [ 1 . 47 – 2 . 28 ] p < 0 . 001 Martella et al . ( 2023 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 15492 8 / 14 Hospitalization rates among persons aged 0 – 17 showed increasingly lower values than that of the whole population and showed a ﬂ atter trend throughout the analysed period . It is possible that the lower seroprevalence in younger than 18 years reported in several studies , in comparison with adults , may have resulted in lower incidence of hospitalization ( Viner et al . , 2021 ; Pollán et al . , 2020 ; Stringhini et al . , 2020 ) . Admissions rates concerned mostly the age group 0 – 4 years ( 60 . 2 % ) with a cumulative rate of 181 . 83 / 100 , 000 . This result is not surprising , because it is in line with that of other countries . Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in US reported similar results about high hospitalization rates among children 0 – 4 years by depicting increasing cumulative COVID - 19 - associated hospitalizations for 100 , 000 children and adolescents between March 2020 and August 2021 ( Delahoy et al . , 2022 ) . Due to literature reported that those younger than 10 to 14 years are less susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection than those 20 years and older , resulting in lower prevalence ( Viner et al . , 2021 ) , it is not easy to ﬁ nd an explanation to the result that the hospitalization rate was higher for the 0 – 4 range . A suggestion can be that parents of younger children seek for medical help more often than older children and adolescents . The infants ’ vulnerability to severe COVID - 19 is another possible explanation to this ﬁ nding ( Raba et al . , 2020 ) . These explanations also support another important result of the study according to which the age groups ( 5 – 11 and 12 – 17 ) has a lower odds of hospitalizations . Similarly , female sex showed a minor likelihood of hospitalization in comparison with males . Several studies support this ﬁ nding . A systematic review about 12 case series from China reported a proportion of male inpatients between 40 % and 65 % ( Streng et al . , 2020 ) . Trends in case noti ﬁ cation and hospitalization among symptomatic children aged 0 – 17 years in 10 European countries con ﬁ rmed that male children were slightly more likely than female to be admitted in the hospital , reporting a higher crude attack rates for severe disease among males ( Bundle et al . , 2021 ; European Centre for Disease Control , 2021 ) . By contrast , a broad systematic review and meta - analysis about studies from the ﬁ rst pandemic year found no association between sex and odds of severe disease or death ( Harwood et al . , 2022 ) . In northern Italy , ISTAT reports that education level are lower among foreign adults : 47 . 3 % has at least a high school diploma vs . 64 % of Italian adults ( ISTAT , 2019 , 2020 ) . The education level seems to in ﬂ uence parents ’ judgment on own children ’ health status and potentially urgent conditions . Use of emergency care or specialist ’ s consultation are often the ﬁ rst choice also for non - urgent patients rather than family physicians , and this trend relates positively with lower education ( Akbayram & Coskun , 2020 ) . International studies found that less educated and poorer population groups have more often limited or inadequate health literacy ( Hickey et al . , 2018 ; Bonaccorsi et al . , 2016 ) . Related to this , recent ﬁ ndings highlight the impact of health literacy on health outcomes and behaviours . Low health literacy relates negatively with patient ’ s motivation , problem - solving ability , self - ef ﬁ cacy and disease knowledge . Indeed , during the COVID - 19 pandemic both disease knowledge and health literacy signi ﬁ cantly predicted preventive behaviours ( Li & Liu , 2020 ) . Moreover , health literacy effects the use of health care services , since children of parents with lower health literacy may be at higher risk of hospitalization and less use of Martella et al . ( 2023 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 15492 9 / 14 services in the community ( Adams et al . , 2009 ; Berkman et al . , 2011 ) . In accordance , a systematic review found evidence to support that parents seeking care for their children at the Emergency Department have low health literacy , especially in case of children suffering of chronic disease as asthma ( Morrison et al . , 2013 ) . Besides suggestions mentioned above , additional reasons could explain our results . Italy ’ s National Health Service guarantees equal healthcare levels free of charge to all children regardless of nationality , of their ethnic origin , their social or economic situation . A paediatrician , and whenever necessary , paediatric out - and in - patient care in one of the densely spaced hospitals , completely free of charge and equal for all are guaranteed for every child . Thus , equal access to healthcare no linked to distance from a hospital , family income and insurance status , excludes barriers to hospitalizations . Limitations Limitations of this study include that it was conducted at a single region and it is limited to hospitalized patients , and may not be representative of children with COVID - 19 in the ambulatory setting . In addition , data gathering is time - limited and concerns the initial period of pandemic during which safe and preventive measures consisted only in interpersonal contact restrictions and mask wearing . Hence , no evaluation about ﬂ uctuation of infections among children and adolescents related to vaccine introduction and virus mutated Variants of Concern ( VoC ) can be assessed . Since the European Medicine Agency ( EMA ) granted an extension for vaccination against SARS - CoV - 2 in children aged 12 years onward in May 2021 ( European Medicines Agency , 2021a ) , vaccination status of children cannot be considered for the study period . Even later , vaccine approval for children aged from 5 to 11 years occurred in November 2021 ( European Medicines Agency , 2021b ) . Furthermore , spread of VoC ( as Delta variant , B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) causing infection escalation among paediatric population was reported in Italy after the study period ( Public Health England , 2021 ) . The strength of this study is that it is the ﬁ rst large population - based report to demonstrate predictors on SARS - CoV - 2 infection - related hospitalizations in children and adolescent . CONCLUSIONS The current study reports additional data about epidemiology of COVID - 19 among children and adolescents in Northern Italy , focusing on patients requiring tertiary care assistance . It shows a comparable trend of paediatric hospital admissions for COVID - 19 and of the entire population hospitalizations over three waves . COVID - 19 hospital admissions increase with a bimodal age distribution and the most admissions were among patients aged ≤ 4 and 5 – 11 years . According to our results , male - sex , nationality and 0 – 4 age are predictors of hospitalization . This study adds further information on epidemiology of COVID - 19 among paediatric patients for the assessment and the implementation of ef ﬁ cient public health programs through targeted policy decisions .
