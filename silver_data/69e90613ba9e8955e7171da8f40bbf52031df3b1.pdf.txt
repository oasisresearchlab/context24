RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Analysis of a b - helical region in the p55 domain of Helicobacter pylori vacuolating toxin Susan E Ivie 1 , Mark S McClain 2 , Holly M Scott Algood 2 , 3 , D Borden Lacy 1 , Timothy L Cover 1 , 2 , 3 * Abstract Background : Helicobacter pylori is a gram - negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach and contributes to the development of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease . VacA , a toxin secreted by H . pylori , is comprised of two domains , designated p33 and p55 . Analysis of the crystal structure of the p55 domain indicated that its structure is predominantly a right - handed parallel b - helix , which is a characteristic of autotransporter passenger domains . Substitution mutations of specific amino acids within the p33 domain abrogate VacA activity , but thus far , it has been difficult to identify small inactivating mutations within the p55 domain . Therefore , we hypothesized that large portions of the p55 domain might be non - essential for vacuolating toxin activity . To test this hypothesis , we introduced eight deletion mutations ( each corresponding to a single coil within a b - helical segment spanning VacA amino acids 433 - 628 ) into the H . pylori chromosomal vacA gene . Results : All eight of the mutant VacA proteins were expressed by the corresponding H . pylori mutant strains and underwent proteolytic processing to yield ~ 85 kDa passenger domains . Three mutant proteins ( VacA Δ 484 - 504 , Δ 511 - 536 , and Δ 517 - 544 ) were secreted and induced vacuolation of mammalian cells , which indicated that these b - helical coils were dispensable for vacuolating toxin activity . One mutant protein ( VacA Δ 433 - 461 ) exhibited reduced vacuolating toxin activity compared to wild - type VacA . Other mutant proteins , including those containing deletions near the carboxy - terminal end of the b - helical region ( amino acids Val 559 - Asn 628 ) , exhibited marked defects in secretion and increased susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin , which suggested that these proteins were misfolded . Conclusions : These results indicate that within the b - helical segment of the VacA p55 domain , there are regions of plasticity that tolerate alterations without detrimental effects on protein secretion or activity , as well as a carboxy - terminal region in which similar alterations result in protein misfolding and impaired secretion . We propose that non - essential b - helical coils and a carboxy - terminal b - helical segment required for proper protein folding and secretion are features shared by numerous autotransporter passenger domains . Background Numerous bacterial pathogens secrete virulence factors by a type V ( autotransporter ) pathway [ 1 ] . Crystallo - graphic studies of three passenger domains secreted by a classical ( type Va ) autotransporter pathway revealed that each has a predominantly b - helical structure [ 2 - 4 ] , and it is predicted that nearly all autotransporter pas - senger domains share a b - helical fold [ 5 ] . Very little is known about the structural features that are responsible for the unique properties of individual autotransporter passenger domains . The Helicobacter pylori VacA toxin is one of the most extensively studied bacterial proteins secreted by a classi - cal autotransporter pathway [ 6 - 9 ] . VacA is classified as a pore - forming toxin , but unlike many other bacterial pore - forming toxins , VacA is internalized by cells and can cause cellular alterations by acting intracellularly [ 6 , 7 , 10 ] . VacA causes a wide array of alterations in mammalian cells , including cell vacuolation , mitochondrial alterations , and plasma membrane permeabilization [ 6 , 8 ] , and targets a variety of cell types , including gastric epithelial cells [ 11 ] , T cells [ 12 , 13 ] , and mast cells [ 14 , 15 ] . Several lines of evi - dence suggest that VacA contributes to the development of H . pylori - associated peptic ulcer disease and gastric ade - nocarcinoma in humans [ 6 , 11 , 16 - 18 ] . * Correspondence : timothy . l . cover @ vanderbilt . edu 1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , Nashville , TN 37232 , USA Ivie et al .

VacA is synthesized as a 140 kDa precursor protein , which undergoes proteolytic processing to yield a 33 - amino acid signal sequence , a mature 88 kDa secreted toxin , a ~ 12 kDa secreted peptide , and a carboxy - term - inal domain that remains associated with the bacteria [ 18 - 20 ] . The mature 88 kDa VacA passenger domain can be proteolytically processed into an amino - terminal 33 kDa ( p33 ) fragment and a carboxy - terminal 55 kDa ( p55 ) fragment [ 21 ] , which are considered to represent two domains or subunits of VacA [ 18 , 22 , 23 ] ( Fig . 1A ) . When expressed intracellularly in eukaryotic cells , about 422 residues at the amino - terminus of VacA ( compris - ing the p33 domain and part of the p55 domain ) are sufficient to cause cell vacuolation [ 24 ] . Previous studies have shown that the amino - terminal hydrophobic por - tion of the p33 domain has an important role in membrane channel formation [ 24 - 27 ] . Components of both the p33 domain and the p55 domain are required for VacA oligomerization [ 3 , 28 , 29 ] , and components of the p55 domain are required for VacA binding to host cells [ 22 , 30 , 31 ] . Recently the crystal structure of the p55 domain of a VacA protein was determined [ 3 ] . The most striking fea - ture of this domain is the presence of a right - handed parallel b - helical structure , composed of coiled , parallel b - sheet structures ( Fig . 1B ) . Each coil of the parallel b - helix consists of three parallel b - strands connected by loops of different lengths . The b - helical portion of the VacA p55 domain of H . pylori strain 60190 consists of about 13 coils ( Fig . 1B ) [ 3 ] . Substitution mutagenesis of single amino acids within the amino - terminal region of the p33 domain is sufficient to ablate multiple activities Figure 1 Introduction of deletion mutations into the VacA p55 domain . ( A ) Diagram of the full - length 88 kDa VacA protein secreted by H . pylori strain 60190 [ 19 ] . p33 ( amino acids 1 to 311 ) and p55 ( amino acids 312 - 821 ) domains are shown . Mutations encoding single coil deletions within the b - helix of the p55 domain were introduced into the H . pylori chromosomal vacA gene by natural transformation and allelic exchange as described in Methods . The relative position of each single coil deletion is shown . ( B ) Crystal structure of the p55 VacA domain of H . pylori strain 60190 [ 3 ] . The sites of two coils targeted for deletion mutagenesis ( amino acids 433 - 461 and 608 - 628 ) are highlighted in red . Ivie et al . BMC Microbiology 2010 , 10 : 60 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2180 / 10 / 60 Page 2 of 10 of VacA [ 24 - 27 ] , but in contrast , it has been difficult to identify small inactivating mutations within the p55 domain [ 26 ] . The only known small inactivating muta - tion within the p55 domain is a deletion of two amino acids ( aspartic acid 346 and glycine 347 , located in a region of the p55 domain not included in the crystal structure ) [ 29 , 32 ] , which results in defective oligomeri - zation of VacA . Since it has been difficult to identify small inactivating mutations within the p55 domain [ 26 ] , we hypothesized that large portions of the p55 domain might be non - essential for vacuolating toxin activity . To test this hypothesis , in the current study we generated a set of H . pylori mutant strains expressing VacA proteins in which individual coils of the p55 b - helix were deleted , and we then analyzed the secretion and activity of these mutant proteins . We report that within the VacA b - helix , there are regions of plasticity that tolerate alterations without detrimental effects on protein secretion or activity , as well as a carboxy - terminal region in which similar alterations result in impaired secretion and protein misfolding . Methods H . pylori strains and growth conditions H . pylori wild - type strain 60190 ( ATCC 49503 ) was the parent strain used for construction of all mutants in this study . The sequence of the VacA protein encoded by this strain is deposited as GenBank accession number Q48245 . Throughout this study , we use an amino acid numbering system in which residue 1 refers to alanine 1 of the secreted 88 kDa VacA protein , and the p55 domain corresponds to amino acids 312 to 821 . H . pylori strains were grown on trypticase soy agar plates containing 5 % sheep blood at 37°C in ambient air con - taining 5 % CO 2 . H . pylori liquid cultures were grown in sulfite - free Brucella broth containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( BB - FBS ) . Introduction of deletion mutations into the chromosomal vacA gene of H . pylori To introduce in - frame internal deletion mutations into a plasmid encoding VacA , we performed inverse PCR using pMM592 ( encoding wild - type VacA , amino acids 1 to 821 ) [ 33 ] as template DNA , 5 ’ - phosphorylated pri - mers , and Pfu Turbo polymerase ( Stratagene ) . The resulting PCR products were then ligated and trans - formed into E . coli DH5 a . Each plasmid was analyzed by DNA sequencing to verify that the desired deletion was present . To introduce the mutations into the H . pylori chromosomal vacA gene [ 25 , 34 , 35 ] , H . pylori strains containing a sacB - kanamycin cassette within vacA [ 36 ] were transformed with plasmids containing vacA deletion mutations . Three strains ( VM025 , VM018 , and VM028 ) , each derived from H . pylori strain 60190 and each containing the sacB - kanamycin cassette in a different site within vacA [ 36 ] , were used to facili - tate construction of the desired mutants . Sucrose - resis - tant , kanamycin - sensitive transformants were selected by growth on Brucella broth plates supplemented with 10 % FBS and 5 . 5 % sucrose [ 36 ] . Full - length vacA sequences encoding the secreted p88 VacA protein were PCR - amplified from mutant strains , and the nucleotide sequences of PCR products were analyzed to confirm that the desired mutation had been introduced success - fully into the chromosomal vacA gene . Immunoblot analysis of VacA To detect VacA expression , proteins in individual sam - ples were separated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis , transferred to nitrocellulose membrane , and immunoblotted using a polyclonal rabbit anti - VacA antiserum ( # 958 ) raised against the secreted 88 kDa pas - senger domain [ 37 ] , followed by horseradish peroxidase - labeled rabbit IgG . Peptide mapping experiments , using a set of overlapping 16 - amino - acid peptides derived from VacA , indicate that the polyclonal anti - VacA anti - serum # 958 reacts with at least 10 different epitopes dis - tributed throughout the secreted 88 kDa VacA protein , including the amino - terminus ( amino acids 1 - 16 ) and the carboxy - terminus ( amino acids 813 - 828 ) ( our unpublished data ) . To confirm similar loading of lysates from wild - type and mutant H . pylori strains , the lysates were immunoblotted with rabbit antiserum to HspB ( a GroEL heat shock protein homolog ) [ 38 ] . The anti - HspB serum was also used to detect the potential release of HspB into culture supernatant by autolysis . Signals were generated by the enhanced chemilumines - cence reaction and detected using x - ray film . Preparation of broth culture supernatants and normalization of VacA concentrations H . pylori strains were grown in BB - FBS for 48 hours . Broth culture supernatants were concentrated 30 - fold by ultrafiltration with a 30 kDa cutoff membrane . Relative concentrations of VacA in different broth culture super - natant preparations were determined by antigen - detec - tion ELISA [ 36 ] . Broth culture supernatants were diluted in carbonate buffer ( 18 mM Na 2 CO 3 , 34 . 8 mM NaHCO 3 ) and allowed to adhere to an ELISA plate overnight at room temperature . After removal of unbound VacA proteins , wells were blocked with phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 3 % BSA and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 . VacA was detected with rabbit anti - VacA antiserum ( # 958 ) and horseradish peroxidase - labeled rabbit IgG followed by TMB substrate ( Pierce ) . To permit normalization of VacA concentrations in dif - ferent preparations , samples were diluted with Ivie et al . BMC Microbiology 2010 , 10 : 60 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2180 / 10 / 60 Page 3 of 10 appropriate quantities of culture supernatant from a vacA null mutant strain , based on the antigen - detection ELISA results . Sonication of H . pylori H . pylori grown on blood agar plates were suspended in sonication buffer [ 20 mM Tris - acetate ( pH 7 . 9 ) , 50 mM potassium acetate , 5 mM Na 2 EDTA , 1 mM dithiothrei - tol ( DTT ) , protease inhibitor cocktail ] and sonicated on ice for three 10 second pulses . The lysate was centri - fuged at 15 , 000 rpm and the supernatant collected . Susceptibility of VacA to proteolysis by trypsin H . pylori grown on blood agar plates were suspended in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , and bacterial suspen - sions were treated with trypsin ( 0 . 05 % ) for 30 min at 37° C . After addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail , the bacteria were pelleted , and the pellet washed once with PBS containing protease inhibitor . The pellet was then suspended in SDS lysis buffer , boiled , and analyzed by immunoblot . Sonicated preparations of H . pylori were treated with trypsin and analyzed in the same manner . Analysis of VacA reactivity with a monoclonal antibody Concentrated culture supernatants containing different VacA mutant proteins were adjusted so that the VacA concentrations were normalized , and then were diluted in carbonate buffer and allowed to adhere to an ELISA plate overnight at room temperature . After removal of unbound VacA proteins , wells were blocked with phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 3 % BSA and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 . VacA was detected with mouse anti - VacA ( 5E4 ) [ 35 ] and horseradish peroxidase - labeled mouse IgG followed by TMB substrate ( Pierce ) . Cell culture analysis of VacA proteins HeLa cells were grown as described previously [ 22 ] . AZ - 521 cells ( a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line , Culture Collection of Health Science Research Resources Bank , Japan Health Sciences Foundation ) and RK13 cells ( ATCC CCL - 37 , a rabbit kidney cell line ) were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 mM non - essential amino acids . For vacuolating assays , cells were seeded at 2 × 10 4 cells / well into 96 - well plates 24 hours prior to each experi - ment . The VacA content of different samples was nor - malized as described above . Serial dilutions of samples were added to serum - free tissue culture medium overly - ing cells ( supplemented with 5 mM ammonium chlor - ide ) and incubated for 8 - 10 hours at 37°C . An equivalent volume of a corresponding preparation from a vacA null mutant was used as a negative control . After incubation , cell vacuolation was examined by inverted light microscopy and quantified by a neutral red uptake assay [ 39 ] . Neutral red uptake data are pre - sented as A 540 values ( mean ± S . D . ) . Background levels of neutral red uptake by cells treated with culture super - natant from a vacA null mutant were subtracted to yield net neutral red uptake values . Results Expression and secretion of mutant VacA proteins by H . pylori The structure of the VacA p55 domain is dominated by b - helical coils [ 3 ] . In previous studies , it has been diffi - cult to identify specific amino acids within the p55 domain that are important for toxin activity [ 26 ] . To determine whether specific b - helical elements within the VacA p55 domain are required for VacA activity , we introduced an ordered series of eight deletion mutations , each 20 to 28 amino acids in length , into a portion of the vacA gene that encodes the p55 domain . These dele - tion mutations were designed so that each would result in the deletion of a single coil of the b - helix ( Fig . 1A ; representative single coils are highlighted in Fig . 1B ) . By designing the deletion mutations in this manner , it was predicted that the mutant proteins would exhibit reduc - tions in the length of the b - helical region but would exhibit minimal changes in protein folding in compari - son to the wild - type VacA protein . All of the deletion mutations analyzed in this study are located outside of the VacA region ( amino acids 1 - 422 ) previously found to be required for cell vacuolation when VacA is expressed in transiently transfected cells [ 24 ] . Each of the mutations was introduced into the H . pylori chro - mosomal vacA gene by natural transformation and alle - lic exchange as described in Methods . Each mutant H . pylori strain was tested by immuno - blot analysis for the capacity to express VacA . We first analyzed expression of the mutant strains grown on blood agar plates . Each mutant strain expressed a VacA protein with a mass of ~ 85 kDa ( corresponding to the VacA passenger domain ) , which indicated that in each case , the ~ 140 kDa VacA protoxin underwent proteoly - tic processing similar to wild - type VacA ( data not shown ) . We next analyzed expression and secretion of VacA when the bacteria were grown in broth culture . Wild - type H . pylori and each of the mutant strains exhibited similar patterns of growth . Immunoblot analy - sis of the bacterial cell pellets indicated that , as expected , each of the mutant strains expressed an ~ 85 kDa VacA protein ( Fig . 2A ) . In comparison to wild - type VacA , several of the mutant VacA proteins were present in reduced amounts in the bacterial cell pellets ( Fig . 2A and 2B ) . Immunoblot analysis of the broth culture supernatants indicated that each of the mutant strains secreted or released an ~ 85 kDa VacA protein . In com - parison to secretion of VacA by the wild - type strain , Ivie et al . BMC Microbiology 2010 , 10 : 60 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2180 / 10 / 60 Page 4 of 10 several of the mutant VacA proteins were secreted at moderately reduced levels , and three mutant proteins ( VacA Δ 559 - 579 , Δ 580 - 607 , and Δ 608 - 628 ) were nearly undetectable in culture supernatant ( Fig . 2C and 2D ) . Analysis of the culture supernatants by ELISA yielded similar results ( data not shown ) . Thus , all eight of the mutant proteins were expressed and underwent proteo - lytic processing similar to that of wild - type VacA , but there was substantial variation among the mutant pro - teins in the levels of expression and secretion . Susceptibility of VacA mutant proteins to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin Previous studies have shown that the wild - type 88 kDa VacA passenger domain is secreted and released into the extracellular space and that 88 kDa proteins also remain localized on the surface of H . pylori [ 40 ] . To investigate whether the mutant VacA proteins were able to localize on the bacterial surface similar to wild - type VacA , the wild - type and mutant H . pylori strains were harvested from blood agar plates and treated with trypsin as described in Methods . Trypsin is expected to proteolyti - cally cleave proteins on the surface of the bacteria , but not intracellular proteins [ 7 ] . Each of the ~ 85 kDa mutant proteins was cleaved by trypsin ( Fig . 3A ) , which provided evidence that these mutant VacA proteins are transported across the inner and outer membranes and localize on the surface of the bacteria . To analyze potential differences in folding properties of the VacA mutant proteins compared to wild - type VacA , we analyzed the susceptibility of these proteins to proteo - lytic cleavage . Lysates of H . pylori strains were generated by sonication , and the solubilized proteins were treated with trypsin as described in Methods . Trypsin digestion of two of the mutant proteins ( Δ 511 - 536 and Δ 517 - 544 ) yielded proteolytic digest patterns that were identical to each other and similar to that of trypsin - digested wild - type VacA ( Fig . 3B ) . Trypsin digestion of two other mutant proteins ( Δ 433 - 461 and Δ 484 - 504 ) yielded differ - ent digest patterns , but these mutant proteins were not completely degraded ( Fig . 3B ) . Four mutant proteins ( Δ 462 - 483 , Δ 559 - 579 , Δ 580 - 607 , and Δ 608 - 628 ) were completely degraded by trypsin ( Fig . 3B ) . In general , the four mutant proteins that exhibited relative resistance to trypsin digestion were secreted at relatively high levels compared to mutant proteins that were completely degraded by trypsin ( compare Fig . 2 and Fig . 3B ) . The observed variation among mutant VacA proteins in sus - ceptibility to trypsin - mediated proteolysis suggested that the individual mutant proteins differed in folding Figure 2 Expression and secretion of wild - type and mutant VacA proteins . H . pylori wild - type strain 60190 , strains expressing mutant forms of VacA , and a vacA null mutant strain ( VM018 ) [ 36 ] were grown in broth culture . Broth cultures were normalized by optical density ( OD 600 nm ) and then pellets ( A ) and unconcentrated broth culture supernatants ( C ) were analyzed by immunoblot assay using polyclonal anti - VacA serum # 958 . Samples were also immunoblotted with a control antiserum against H . pylori heat shock protein ( HspB ) . The intensity of immunoreactive VacA bands was quantified by densitometry ( panels B and D ) . Wild - type VacA and each of the mutant proteins were expressed and proteolytically processed to yield ~ 85 - 88 kDa proteins that were secreted into the broth culture supernatant . Western blots depict representative results from one of three independent experiments ; histograms represent results pooled from three independent experiments . Results represent the mean ± SD . * , p < 0 . 05 compared to wild - type VacA , as determined by Student ’ s t - test . Ivie et al . BMC Microbiology 2010 , 10 : 60 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2180 / 10 / 60 Page 5 of 10 properties . The proteins that were highly susceptible to trypsin digestion and secreted at very low levels ( Δ 462 - 483 , Δ 559 - 579 , Δ 580 - 607 , and Δ 608 - 628 ) were probably misfolded . Due to the very low concentrations of these four proteins in the broth culture supernatants , these mutant VacA proteins were not studied further . To evaluate whether the four mutant proteins exhibit - ing relative resistance to trypsin - mediated proteolysis ( i . e . VacA Δ 433 - 461 , Δ 484 - 504 , Δ 511 - 536 , and Δ 517 - 544 ) shared other features with wild - type VacA , we analyzed the reactivity of these proteins with an anti - VacA mono - clonal antibody ( 5E4 ) that recognizes a conformational epitope [ 35 ] . Each of the four mutant VacA proteins was recognized by the 5E4 antibody ( Fig . 4 ) , which provided additional evidence that these mutant proteins were folded in a manner similar to that of wild - type VacA . Analysis of vacuolating activity of mutant VacA proteins We next investigated whether the mutant VacA proteins retained vacuolating toxin activity . As a first approach , we attempted to purify the mutant VacA proteins from H . pylori broth culture supernatants , using methods that are well - established for purification of water - soluble oli - gomeric forms of wild - type VacA or mutant VacA pro - teins that contain alterations in the p33 domain [ 26 , 34 , 36 ] . We focused these purification efforts on the four mutant proteins that were secreted at the highest levels and that exhibited evidence of protein folding similar to that of wild - type VacA ( i . e . VacA Δ 433 - 461 , Δ 484 - 504 , Δ 511 - 536 , and Δ 517 - 544 ) . The yields of puri - fied mutant proteins were markedly lower than yields of purified wild - type VacA , and several of the VacA mutant proteins were not successfully purified . These results could be attributable to relative defects in oligo - merization of mutant proteins compared to wild - type VacA , or could be attributable to other altered proper - ties of the mutant proteins that resulted in aberrant behavior during the purification procedure . Since it was not possible to purify sufficient quantities of the mutant VacA proteins to permit analysis of Figure 3 Susceptibility of VacA proteins to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin . A ) Intact H . pylori strains [ wild - type strain 60190 , strains expressing mutant forms of VacA , and a vacA null mutant strain ( VM018 ) ] were suspended in PBS and incubated in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of trypsin as described in Methods . After centrifugation , bacterial pellets were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal anti - VacA serum # 958 . ( B ) H . pylori strains were sonicated as described in Methods . After centrifugation , the soluble fractions were analyzed further . The total protein concentration of each sample was approximately 7 . 5 μ g / ml , as determined by A 280 values ( data not shown ) . Samples were incubated in the presence ( + ) or absence ( - ) of trypsin and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal anti - VacA serum # 958 . Figure 4 Reactivity of VacA mutant proteins with a monoclonal anti - VacA antibody . Wild - type H . pylori strain 60190 and strains expressing mutant VacA proteins were grown in broth culture , and secreted VacA proteins were normalized as described in Methods . Wells of ELISA plates were coated with broth culture supernatants , and reactivity of the proteins with an anti - VacA monoclonal antibody ( 5E4 ) that recognizes a conformational epitope was determined by ELISA . Reactivity of a vacA null mutant was subtracted as background . Relative VacA concentrations are indicated . Values represent the mean ± SD from triplicate samples . Ivie et al . BMC Microbiology 2010 , 10 : 60 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2180 / 10 / 60 Page 6 of 10 vacuolating toxin activity , we used an alternative approach . H . pylori culture supernatants containing wild - type VacA or mutant proteins were normalized by ELISA so that the VacA concentrations were similar , as described in Methods , and then were tested for vacuo - lating toxin activity . Using this approach , it was possible to test the activity of the four mutant proteins that were secreted at the highest levels and that exhibited evidence of protein folding similar to that of wild - type VacA ( i . e . VacA Δ 433 - 461 , Δ 484 - 504 , Δ 511 - 536 , and Δ 517 - 544 ) , but analysis of the remaining VacA mutant proteins ( which exhibited evidence of defective folding ) was not possible due to prohibitively low concentrations of the secreted mutant proteins and inability to normalize the concentrations of these proteins . The mutant proteins were initially tested for ability to induce vacuolation of HeLa cells , a cell line that is commonly used for the study of VacA activity . Each of the mutant proteins ( VacA Δ 433 - 461 , Δ 484 - 504 , Δ 511 - 536 , and Δ 517 - 544 ) induced vacuolation of HeLa cells ( Fig . 5A ) , but one of the mutants , VacA Δ 433 - 461 , exhibited reduced vacuo - lating activity compared to wild - type VacA . The same preparations of mutant proteins were then tested for their ability to induce vacuolation of AZ - 521 cells ( human gastric epithelial cells ) and RK13 cells ( rabbit kidney cells ) , two cells lines that have been used for analysis of VacA activity [ 41 - 43 ] . VacA Δ 484 - 504 , Δ 511 - 536 , and Δ 517 - 544 each caused vacuolation of RK13 and AZ - 521 cells , but VacA Δ 433 - 461 lacked detectable vacuolating activity for both RK13 and AZ - 521 cells ( Fig . 5B and 5C ) . Thus , three of mutant proteins caused vacuolation of all the tested cell lines in a manner simi - lar to wild - type VacA , whereas VacA Δ 433 - 461 caused reduced vacuolation of HeLa cells and did not cause detectable vacuolation of RK13 or AZ - 521 cells . These data suggest that residues within the region spanning amino acids 433 to 461 contribute to VacA activity , and indicate that the b - helical coils corresponding to amino acids 484 - 504 , 511 - 536 and 517 - 544 are dispensable for vacuolating toxin activity . Discussion In this study , we sought to identify regions of the p55 b - helix that are either essential or non - essential for vacuo - lating toxin activity . All of the VacA mutant proteins analyzed in this study were designed in a manner that resulted in the deletion of a single coil of the b - helix , based on analysis of the crystal structure of the VacA p55 domain [ 3 ] . We predicted that all of the mutant VacA proteins would retain a b - helical structure , and that this mutagenesis approach would result in minimal disruptions in protein folding . As a first step , we analyzed the proteolytic processing and secretion of the mutant proteins . All eight of the mutant VacA proteins were expressed by the correspond - ing H . pylori mutant strains and underwent proteolytic processing to yield ~ 85 kDa passenger domains . We found that several individual coils within the p55 domain could be deleted without substantially altering the capa - city of the proteins to undergo secretion by H . pylori . In contrast , the deletion of other coils led to a marked defect in VacA secretion . The mutant proteins that exhibited marked defects in secretion also exhibited Figure 5 Vacuolating cytotoxic activity of mutant proteins . Wild - type H . pylori strain 60190 and strains expressing mutant VacA proteins were grown in broth culture , and secreted VacA proteins were normalized as described in Methods . Serial two - fold dilutions of VacA - containing preparations were added to HeLa cells ( A ) , RK13 cells ( B ) , and AZ - 521 cells ( C ) . Vacuolating activity was measured by neutral red uptake . Relative VacA concentrations are indicated . Results represent the mean ± SD from triplicate samples , expressed as a percent of neutral red uptake induced by wild - type VacA . * , p ≤ 0 . 02 as determined by Student ’ s t - test compared to wild type VacA . Similar results were observed in three independent experiments . Ivie et al . BMC Microbiology 2010 , 10 : 60 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2180 / 10 / 60 Page 7 of 10 increased susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin , which suggested that these proteins were misfolded . In addition to the mutant VacA proteins shown in Figure 1 , we also generated H . pylori mutant strains expressing VacA proteins in which two coils ( Δ 433 - 483 ) or four coils ( Δ 433 - 529 ) of the b - helix were deleted . These mutant strains expressed truncated VacA proteins of the expected size ( approximately 82 and 77 kDa , respectively ) at levels similar to the level of wild - type VacA expression , but these mutant proteins were poorly secreted ( data not shown ) . These findings suggest that VacA proteins con - taining large deletions ( more than one coil ) within the b - helical region of the p55 domain are poorly secreted . Similarly , a previous study reported efforts to introduce large deletions into the region of the H . pylori chromoso - mal vacA gene that encodes the VacA p55 domain , and most of the resulting mutant proteins were neither expressed nor secreted by H . pylori [ 36 ] . In the current study , the three mutant VacA proteins that exhibited the most striking defects in secretion ( Δ 559 - 579 , Δ 580 - 607 , Δ 608 - 628 ) each contained deletions that are localized near the carboxy - terminus of the b - helix . Interestingly , a study of Bordetella pertussis BrkA revealed that a b - helical region near the carboxy - terminus of the passenger domain is required for folding of this pro - tein [ 44 ] . The authors proposed that this domain acts as an intramolecular chaperone to promote folding of the passenger domain concurrent with or following transloca - tion through the outer membrane . Similarly , studies of B . pertussis pertactin indicate that the carboxy - terminal b - helical region of this protein exhibits enhanced stability and can fold as a stable core structure [ 5 , 45 ] . We speculate that VacA amino acids 559 - 628 have a similar functional role in promoting protein folding and secretion . An important finding in the current study is that , within the VacA b - helix , there are regions of plasticity that tolerate alterations without detrimental effects on protein secretion or toxin activity . VacA Δ 484 - 504 , Δ 511 - 536 , and Δ 517 - 544 mutant proteins each retained vacuolating activity similar to that of wild - type VacA , which indicates that the corresponding coils are dispen - sable for vacuolating toxin activity . The retention of vacuolating activity despite the deletion of entire coils of the b - helix correlates well with results from a previous study , which reported that inactivating point mutations within the portion of vacA encoding the p55 domain could not be identified [ 26 ] . One of the VacA mutant proteins analyzed in the current study ( Δ 433 - 461 ) exhib - ited detectable vacuolating toxin activity on HeLa cells , but its activity on HeLa cells was reduced compared to that of wild - type VacA , and it lacked detectable activity on RK13 cells and AZ521 cells . These data suggest that residues within this VacA region ( amino acids 433 - 461 ) have an important role in VacA activity . Further studies may lead to the identification of specific amino acids within this region that mediate interactions between VacA and host cells . Similar to most previous studies , the current study assessed the effects of VacA mutations on the ability of VacA to cause cell vacuolation . Future investigations may provide new insights into structural properties of VacA that are required for other actions of this multifunctional toxin . Conclusions VacA is a unique toxin that is considered to be an impor - tant determinant of H . pylori virulence , and therefore , it is important to have an in - depth understanding of VacA structure and function . The VacA p55 structure is predo - minantly a right - handed parallel b - helix , which is a char - acteristic of autotransporter passenger domains . Previous studies suggested that the p55 domain contributes to VacA binding to cells , but it has been difficult to identify small inactivating mutations within the p55 domain . Therefore , we hypothesized that large segments of the p55 domain might be non - essential for vacuolating toxin activity . To test this hypothesis , we constructed and ana - lyzed a set of H . pylori mutant strains expressing VacA proteins in which individual coils of the beta - helix were deleted . Three mutant proteins containing deletions in the region spanning VacA amino acids 484 - 544 were effi - ciently secreted and induced vacuolation of mammalian cells , which indicates that these segments are dispensable for vacuolating toxin activity . We also identified a region near the carboxy - terminal end of the b - helix ( amino acids 559 - 628 ) , in which the introduction of similar dele - tion mutations resulted in marked defects in protein secretion and apparent defects in protein folding . We propose that non - essential b - helical coils and a carboxy - terminal b - helical segment required for proper protein folding and secretion are features of numerous autotran - sporter passenger domains .
