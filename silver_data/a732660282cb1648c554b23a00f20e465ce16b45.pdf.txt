EHD2 is the only family member whose crystal structure has been solved , and it contains an unstructured loop consisting of two proline - phenylalanine ( PF ) motifs : KPF RKL NPF . In contrast , despite EHD2 having nearly 70 % amino acid identity with its paralogs , EHD1 , EHD3 and EHD4 , the latter proteins contain a single KPF or RPF motif , but no NPF motif . In this study , we sought to define the precise role of each PF motif in EHD2 ’ s homo - dimerization , binding with the protein partners , and subcellular localization . To test the role of the NPF motif , we generated an EHD2 NPF - to - NAF mutant to mimic the homologous sequences of EHD1 and EHD3 . We demonstrated that this mutant lost both its ability to dimerize and bind to Syndapin2 . However , it continued to localize primarily to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane . On the other hand , EHD2 NPF - to - APA mutants displayed normal dimerization and Syndapin2 binding , but exhibited markedly increased nuclear localization and reduced association with the plasma membrane . We then hypothe - sized that the single PF motif of EHD1 ( that aligns with the KPF of EHD2 ) might be responsi - ble for both binding and localization functions of EHD1 . Indeed , the EHD1 RPF motif was required for dimerization , interaction with MICAL - L1 and Syndapin2 , as well as localization to tubular recycling endosomes . Moreover , recycling assays demonstrated that EHD1 RPF - to - APA was incapable of supporting normal receptor recycling . Overall , our data suggest that the EHD2 NPF phenylalanine residue is crucial for EHD2 localization to the plasma membrane , whereas the proline residue is essential for EHD2 dimerization and binding . These studies support the recently proposed model in which the EHD2 N - terminal region may regulate the availability of the unstructured loop for interactions with neighboring EHD2 dimers , thus promoting oligomerization .

Introduction The C - terminal Eps15 homology domain - containing ( EHD ) proteins are involved in a variety of endocytic membrane regulatory events [ 1 ] . All four EHDs share a characteristic domain architecture that includes a C - terminal Eps15 Homology ( EH ) domain with a positively charged electrostatic surface that selectively binds to proteins containing an asparagine - proline - phenylalanine ( NPF ) motif followed by acidic residues [ 2 – 5 ] . In addition , each EHD protein contains a dynamin - like G - domain that binds ATP and catalyzes its hydrolysis [ 6 – 9 ] . The most diverse EHD both in its sequence homology and function is EHD2 [ 10 ] . EHD2 has been reported to regulate a variety of important functions that include sarcolemmal repair [ 11 ] , myoblast fusion [ 12 , 13 ] , and control of Rac1 and the actin cytoskeleton [ 14 – 17 ] . In con - trast to EHD1 , EHD3 and EHD4 , all of which play roles in regulating endocytic transport from sorting and recycling endosomes [ 1 , 18 , 19 ] , EHD2 is recruited to the plasma membrane by phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) [ 20 ] where it interacts with caveolin and regulates caveolar mobility [ 14 , 21 , 22 ] . The mouse EHD2 crystal structure indicates that this protein contains a partially conserved region with two proline - phenylalanine motifs KPFRKLNPF in an unstructured flexible loop near the G - domain [ 9 ] ( Fig 1A ) . This unstructured KPFRKLNPF region was proposed to link EHD2 dimer pairs through interactions with neighboring EH domains [ 9 ] . Recent studies Fig 1 . EHD protein domain architecture and sequence homology . ( A ) The Eps15 Homology Domain ( EHD ) proteins have a conserved domain architecture comprised of four domains : two helical domains , a G - domain , and a C - terminal EH domain . The G - domain of EHD2 contains an unstructured loop containing the following amino acid sequence , KPFRKLNPF , which is required for oligomerization . ( B ) The four EHD isoforms share 67 – 86 % residue identity . The amino acid sequence alignment of the unstructured loop for all four EHDs ( see green frame ) shows that only EHD2 has two successive PF motifs : N PF and K PF , whereas the other EHD proteins have only one PF motif . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0123710 . g001 Role of the EHD2 Unstructured Loop PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0123710 April 15 , 2015 2 / 17 provide support for the notion that both PF motifs may be important for EHD2 localization and function [ 22 ] , in addition to the N - terminal region of EHD2 [ 23 ] . However , the degree to which each of these two closely situated PF motifs impacts EHD2 function , and particularly how each motif affects dimerization and interactions with binding partners remains unknown . The function of the PF motifs in the unstructured loop in EHD proteins is further compli - cated because while EHD2 has dual PF motifs in its KPFRKLNPF sequence , the other three EHD paralogs all contain only a single PF motif ( Fig 1B ) ; either a KPF or RPF motif at the N - terminal side of the unstructured loop . Indeed , both EHD1 and EHD3 have a NAF motif ( instead of NPF ) , whereas EHD4 has a SRF motif . In this study , we set out to determine the significance of EHD2 ’ s KPF and NPF motifs for its ability to dimerize , interact with protein partners and localize to caveolae . We demonstrate here that when the EHD2 NPF is mutated to NAF , there is loss of dimerization and protein binding , but this motif has little impact on EHD2 localization in the cell . On the other hand , mutation of the NPF motif to APA has little or no impact on dimerization or partner binding , but shunts EHD2 localization from mostly at the plasma membrane to the nucleus . Examining EHD1 as a representative of the other three more closely related EHDs , we found that the sin - gle RPF motif of EHD1 is required for ( i ) its dimerization , ( ii ) interaction with protein partners , and ( iii ) its localization to tubular recycling endosomes . Overall , these data indicate that the proline and phenylalanine residues that comprise EHD2 ’ s NPF motif regulate different func - tions , suggesting that this motif may have additional roles to its proposed interactions with neighboring EHD2 EH domains . Materials and Methods Cells , Reagents and Antibodies HeLa cells ( cervical cancer cell line , ATCC - CCL2 ; Manassas , VA ) were maintained in high glu - cose Dulbecco ’ s Modified Eagle ’ s Medium supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 200 U / ml penicillin , 200 μ g / ml streptomycin , 2 mM L - glutamine , and 10 mM HEPES . All media reagents , except for the fetal bovine serum , were from Invitrogen . The fol - lowing antibodies were used in this study : rabbit anti - caveolin1 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , Alexa - Fluor - 568 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( H + L ) ( Molecular Probes ) . Recombinant DNA Constructs Cloning of EHD1 , EHD2 , EHD3 , EHD4 , MICAL - L1 , Syndapin2 into yeast two - hybrid vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7 , as well as cloning of GFP - Myc – EHD1 , its siRNA resistant version , and GFP - Myc - EHD2 is described in ( Caplan et al . , 2002 ; Sharma et al . , 2009 ; Giridharan et al . , 2013 ) . Two - hybrid control vectors ( Gal4ad - SV40 large T - antigen and Gal4bd - p53 ) were purchased from Clontech ( Palo Alto ) . The following constructs were generated using a Quik - Change Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene ) : EHD2 ( NPF - to - NAF ) , EHD2 ( NPF - to - NPA ) , EHD2 ( NPF - to - APA ) , EHD2 ( KPF - to - KAF ) , EHD2 ( KPF - to - APA ) , and EHD1 ( RPF - to - APA ) in yeast - two hybrid vectors and in the GFP - Myc - EHD1 and GFP - Myc - EHD2 vectors ( mammalian expression vectors ) . The following mutations were also introduced by site - directed mutagenesis : GFP - Myc - EHD2 ( NPF - to - NPY ) and GFP - Myc - EHD2 ( NPF - to - NFP ) . Yeast Two Hybrid The yeast two - hybrid assay was done as described previously [ 24 ] . Briefly , the Saccharomyces cer - evisiae strain , AH109 ( BD Biosciences ) , was maintained on YPD agar plates . A loop full of yeast was grown overnight at 30°C and shaking at 250 rpm in liquid YPD media .

For colony growth assays , AH109 co - transformants were streaked on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan . Cells were left to grow at 30°C , usually for three days , or until the colonies were large enough for further assays . An average of three to four colonies were selected and suspended in water , equilibrated to the same optical density as other colonies from different transformants at 600 nm , and replated on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan ( + HIS , - 2 plates ) , as well as plates lacking histidine ( - HIS , - 3 plates ) . The positive control for interactions was co - transformed p53 and SV40 . Confocal microscopy imaging HeLa cells were grown on cover slips and fixed with 4 % ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde in PBS . The fixed cells were then incubated with primary antibodies prepared in staining solution [ 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) saponin and 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS ] for 1 h at room tempera - ture . After washing in PBS , the cells were incubated with the appropriate fluorochrome - conjugated secondary antibody mixture in staining solution for 30 minutes at room tempera - ture . Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thorn - wood , NY ) using a 63 X 1 . 4 numerical aperture objective with appropriate filters . Structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) imaging SIM images were collected on samples obtained as described above with a Zeiss ELYRA PS . 1 il - lumination system ( Carl Zeiss Microimaging ) using a 63 X objective lens with a numerical ap - erture of 1 . 4 at room temperature as we have previously done [ 25 , 26 ] . Three orientation angles of the excitation grid were acquired for each z plane , with z spacing of 110 nm between planes . SIM processing was performed with SIM module of the ZEN BLACK software ( Carl Zeiss Microimaging ) . Transfections HeLa cells , plated on 6 well - plates , were transfected using 6 μ l X - tremeGENE 9 ( Roche Applied Sciences ) or 6 μ l Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) with 2 μ g of DNA according to manufacturer ’ s protocol . siRNA duplexes for EHD1 ( base pairs gaaagagatgcccaatgtc , Dharmacon ) were transfected using Oligofectamine ( LifeTechnologies ) to perform knockdown studies as previously de - scribed ( Naslavsky et al . , 2006 ) . Transferrin uptake assays HeLa cells grown on glass clover slips , were starved in DMEM media containing 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for 1 h , then “ pulsed ” with 1 μ g / ml of Alexa Fluor 568 – labeled transfer - rin ( Tf - 568 ) for 15 minutes and chased for 15 minutes in complete media , to allow Tf - 568 recy - cle to the PM and be released . Cells were then fixed and imaged by confocal microscopy . Statistical analysis Where appropriate , the data presented were analyzed by one - way ANOVA , with one star for p < 0 . 01 , and three stars for p < 0 . 05 . Results and Discussion Unlike the other three EHDs , EHD2 homo - dimerizes but does not hetero - dimerize [ 20 ] , and its homo - dimerization may be required for interaction with NPF - containing protein binding Role of the EHD2 Unstructured Loop PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0123710 April 15 , 2015 4 / 17 partners . Accordingly , our goal was to first determine the requirement of the EHD2 NPF motif for homo - dimerization ( Fig 1A and 1B ) . By selective two - hybrid binding assay , we demonstrat - ed that while wild - type EHD2 proteins homo - dimerize , they were incapable of interacting with wild - type EHD1 , EHD3 or EHD4 ( Fig 2A ) . On the other hand , when the EHD2 NPF motif was altered to NAF , the homo - dimerization was no longer observed . EHD2 binds to select NPF - containing protein partners through its EH domain . As shown , wild - type EHD2 interacted with Syndapin2 , but not MICAL - L1 , even though both proteins contain NPF motifs followed by acidic clusters ( Fig 2B ) . Moreover , this interaction could also be observed by co - immunoprecipitation ( S2 Fig and S1 Table ) . However , the EHD2 NPF - to - NAF mutant lost its ability to interact with Syndapin2 , suggesting that the EHD2 NPF motif is required for both homo - dimerization and for protein partner binding . Despite this data in yeast two - hybrid binding studies , the NAF mutant retained its ability to bind to Syndapin2 by co - immunoprecipitation , suggesting the indirect involvement of a bridging protein in cells ( S2 Fig and S1 Table ) . In our previous studies we have demonstrated that EHD2 is capable of interacting with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at the plasma membrane without the need for interaction with other binding partners through its EH domain [ 20 ] . Moren et al . showed that EHD2 caveolar localization was inde - pendent of its protein - binding EH domain [ 22 ] . Indeed , we have demonstrated that the EH do - main is not required for EHD2 ( or EHD1 ) homo - dimerization ( S1A – S1C Fig ) . Accordingly , we asked whether the EHD2 NPF - to - NAF mutant might still localize to the plasma membrane . As demonstrated in Fig 2C – 2D , both wild - type and EHD2 NPF - to - NAF displayed primarily plasma membrane localization as demonstrated by confocal microscopy . Both the wild - type and EHD2 NPF - to - NAF mutant also partially co - localized to structures positive for caveolin - 1 , as observed by Structured Illumination Microscopy ( Fig 2E – 2H ; see insets , asterisks indicate transfected cells ) . These data support the idea that the EHD2 NPF motif has an important role in EHD2 dimerization and protein binding , but that homodimerization is not required for nor - mal localization to the plasma membrane and colocalization with caveolae . In a recent study by Moren et al . , phenylalanine 128 of the EHD2 NPF motif ( see Fig 1A ) was replaced with alanine ( NPF - to - NPA ) and similarly , little change in EHD2 localization was reported [ 22 ] . Since we chose to initially disrupt the NPF motif by substituting the proline for alanine ( NPF - to - NAF ) to mimic the homologous sequence found in both EHD1 and EHD3 , we decided to address the function of EHD2 when the proline residue of its NPF motif is left intact . To this aim we assessed homo - dimerization of EHD2 NPF - to - APA mutants as well as its interaction with Syndapin2 ( Fig 3A and 3B ) . Surprisingly , unlike the EHD2 NPF - to - NAF mutant , the APA mutants retained both homo - dimerization and binding to Syndapin2 . On the other hand , despite normal dimerization and binding , EHD2 NPF - to - APA displayed a dramat - ic relocation to the nucleus ( Fig 3D ) . Although EHD2 has a bipartite nuclear localization se - quence and many cells display a portion of their EHD2 in the nucleus ( Fig 3C ) [ 27 ] , the NPF - to - APA mutant displayed a primarily nuclear localization ( Fig 3D ) . Accordingly , despite the yeast two - hybrid binding , we were unable to detect EHD2 NPF - to - APA interactions with Syn - dapin2 by co - immunoprecipitation , likely due to the mutant ’ s mislocalization exclusively to the nucleus ( S2 Fig and S1 Table ) . Since the Lundmark group used the more subtle EHD2 NPF - to - NPA mutant and did not report such relocation to the nucleus [ 22 ] , we resolved to compare the EHD2 NPF - to - APA mutant to EHD2 NPF - to - NPA . As demonstrated in Fig 4A and 4B , similar to the APA mu - tant , EHD2 NPF - to - NPA continued to homo - dimerize and interact with Syndapin2 . In addition , the subcellular distribution of EHD2 NPF - to - NPA was similar to that of EHD2 NPF - to - APA , with much of the mutant localizing to the nucleus and less observed at the plasma membrane ( compare Fig 4C and 4D ) .

Although we cannot entirely reconcile the differences we observed in EHD2 NPF - to - NPA localization ( largely nuclear ) compared to those of Moren et al . ( Fig 4B ; GFP - EHD2 F128A ) [ 22 ] , not all the EHD2 relocalized to the nucleus , and the remaining EHD2 at the plasma membrane appeared to remain localized to caveolae ( data not shown ) . To specifically assess the role of phenylalanine 128 , we engineered an EHD2 NPF - to - NPY mutant . Our rationale was that tyrosine is the closest residue to phenylalanine , with the only difference being the additional hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring . As shown , EHD2 NPF - to - NPY displayed an intermediate cellular distribution ( compare Fig 4E with 4C and 4D ) . Al - though plasma membrane association was not abolished , a greater component of the EHD2 NPF - to - NPY EHD2 mutant was observed in the nucleus . However , the NPF - to - NPY mutant continued to homo - dimerize with wild - type EHD2 and Syndapin2 ( S3 Fig and S1 Table ) . We then asked whether the spatial localization of phenylalanine 128 is essential for its function in facilitating EHD2 localization primarily to the plasma membrane . To address this , we engi - neered EHD2 NPF - to - NFP , flipping the proline and phenylalanine residues at positions 127 and 128 . The subcellular localization of this NFP mutant was mostly in the nucleus ( Fig 4F ) , al - though some EHD2 was clearly localized to the plasma membrane . In this case , the NPF - to - NFP mutant failed to either homo - dimerize or interact with Syndapin2 ( S3 Fig and S1 Table ) . These data support the notion that phenylalanine 128 is essential for plasma membrane locali - zation , and that its position within the unstructured loop is highly significant . The KPF site in the unstructured EHD2 loop ( Fig 1A and 1B ) has been implicated in caveo - lar binding and stable EHD2 membrane assembly [ 22 ] . However , the impact of this PF motif on EHD2 homo - dimerization and interactions with binding partners has not been studied . Ac - cordingly , we found that EHD2 KPF - to - APA or KPF - to - KAF mutants had no effect on dimer - ization or binding to Syndapin2 ( Fig 5A – 5D ) by yeast two - hybrid binding assays . However , both KPF mutants reduced the level of EHD2 on the plasma membrane and increased the level of nuclear - localized EHD2 compared to wild - type EHD2 ( Fig 5E – 5G ) . For this reason , i . e . , lo - calization of the mutants primarily to the nucleus ( as opposed to the plasma membrane ) , immunoprecipitation experiments did not detect binding between the mutants and Syndapin2 . Overall , these studies suggest a complex function for the unstructured loop and its two PF mo - tifs that may help supports the initial model [ 9 , 22 ] and revised model [ 23 ] proposed for dimer - pair PF - EH domain interactions and EHD2 oligomerization ( see model for further discussion ) . Given that EHD1 contains a single PF motif , namely the RPF motif that aligns with the EHD2 KPF motif ( see Fig 1B ) , we tested the role of this motif on EHD1 dimerization and partner binding . The EHD1 RPF - to - APA mutant displayed abrogated homo - and hetero - dimerization ( Fig 6A ) , loss of binding to MICAL - L1 , and decreased binding to Syndapin2 ( Fig 6B ) . Moreover , the typical subcellular localization of EHD1 to an array of tubular and vesicular recycling endosomes ( Fig 6C ) became mostly cytoplasmic for EHD1 RPF - to - APA mutant ( Fig 6D ) . These data suggest that the single RPF motif in EHD1 carries out the functions of the dual KPF and NPF motifs found in EHD2 . Since EHD1 has a “ non - functional ” NAF motif aligned with the NPF motif of EHD2 ( de - picted in Fig 1B ) , we asked whether the EHD1 NAF motif could assume functionality if its lone existing PF motif ( RPF ) was impaired . As a control , we first engineered EHD1 NAF - to - NPF mutants and showed that as expected , homo - and hetero - dimerization along with MICAL - L1 and Syndapin2 binding remained stable ( Fig 7A and 7B ) . Next , we engineered double mutants where the EHD1 RPF motif was disrupted ( RPF - to - APA ) and the NAF motif was ‘ corrected ’ to NPF . Compared to the EHD1 RPF - to - APA single mutants , which lost all of their dimeriza - tion and protein interactions , the additional NAF - to - NPF mutation partially rescued homo - Role of the EHD2 Unstructured Loop PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0123710 April 15 , 2015 9 / 17 dimerization ( Fig 7C ) and binding to MICAL - L1 ( Fig 7D ) . These results hint that gene duplica - tion and subtle alterations may have allowed the EHD proteins to fine - tune their interactions and subcellular functions . To functionally assess the role of the EHD1 RPF motif , we used an siRNA approach coupled with rescue by transient transfection . As demonstrated , more than 90 % of EHD1 was depleted upon treatment with EHD1 - siRNA ( Fig 8C ) . Compared to control cells , the depletion of Fig 5 .

This accumula - tion is ‘ rescued ’ in EHD1 - depleted cells in which a siRNA - resistant form of the wild - type EHD1 ( siEHD1 ) has been transfected ( Fig 8D and 8E ; see yellow borders for transfected cells ) . On the other hand , when a cytoplasmic - localized EHD1 RPF - to - APA mutant was reintro - duced into EHD1 - depleted cells , the transferrin and its receptor remained accumulated in the perinuclear region of the cell ( Fig 8F and 8G ; see yellow borders for transfected cells ) . These data were quantified ( from 3 experiments ) and showed that whereas wild - type EHD1 rescued the recycling defect in > 85 % of the EHD1 - depleted cells , the RPF - to - APA mutant displayed less than 15 % rescue ( Fig 8H ) . Despite being the only EHD protein whose crystal structure has been solved [ 9 ] , and de - spite important structural characterizations of its interaction with membranes [ 23 ] and its re - cruitment by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 to the plasma membrane [ 20 ] , many of the mechanistic aspects by which EHD2 functions have remained obscure . In this study we have discovered intriguing differences in the function of the proline and phenylalanine residues of the EHD2 NPF motif that is found within the unstructured loop of the G - domain ( Fig 1A ) . Our data suggest that the phenylalanine is crucial for localization to the plasma membrane , and mutation of this residue leads to its accumulation in the nucleus . On the other hand , mutation of the proline residue of this same NPF motif leads to loss of homo - oligomerization and presumed loss of oligomerization , as well as loss of protein partner binding without impacting localization to the plasma membrane . How may these data be interpreted given the elegant structural studies that propose PF - EH domain interactions for EHD2 oligomerization ? Shah and colleagues recently pro - posed that upon membrane sensing , the EHD2 N - terminus moves away from the unstruc - tured loop ( U . L . ) in the G - domain ( illustrated in Fig 9A – 9B ) , thus freeing the KPFRKLNPF ( U . L . ) for interactions with EH domains of nearby EHD2 dimer pairs , promoting oligomeri - zation and caveolar localization ( Fig 9C ) [ 23 ] . Based on this model , we hypothesize that the N - terminal of the EHD2 - NPF - to - NPA mutant ( Fig 9D ) may not completely detach from the G - domain regions flanking the U . L . and thus fail to insert properly into the plasma mem - brane . We rationalize that under such conditions where membrane binding is partially im - paired , the lysine residues in the EHD2 helical domain , which act both as membrane contact sites [ 9 ] and a bipartite nuclear localization sequence [ 27 ] , are now free to act in the latter ca - pacity and promote EHD2 transport to the nucleus . Indeed , EHD2 has been described as a transcriptional repressor [ 27 ] . On the other hand , we predict that with the EHD2 NPF - to - NAF mutant , the EHD2 N - terminus is nonetheless freed from the G - domain to interact with the plasma membrane . However , despite its correct localization , the NAF motif prevents EH binding and thus dimer - ization and oligomerization do not occur . Overall , our study provides support and additional new details that further clarify the com - plex structural model of EHD2 localization , membrane binding , protein binding , dimerization , oligomerization , and function .
