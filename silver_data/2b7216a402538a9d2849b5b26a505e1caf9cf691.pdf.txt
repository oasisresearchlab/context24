The online version of this article contains supplemental material . Introduction Polarized epithelial cells exhibit two functionally and biochem - ically distinct plasma membrane domains , which are separated by tight junctions ( Nelson , 2003 ) . To maintain this apical / baso - lateral polarity , cells must constantly sort transmembrane pro - teins to the correct locations during biosynthetic and endocytic delivery ( F ö lsch , 2008 ) . Sorting of internalized cargo takes place in perinuclear recycling enzymes ( RE ) , whereas sorting of newly synthesized cargo takes place at the TGN or in RE ( see Fig . 2 A ; Ang et al . , 2004 ; Cancino et al . , 2007 ) . For example , a cargo thought to follow a direct pathway from the TGN to the apical membrane is infl uenza HA ( hereafter referred to as HA ; Fullekrug and Simons , 2004 ) , and basolateral cargos thought to follow a direct pathway are FcII - B2 receptors ( FcR ) and a mu - tant low density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR [ Y18A ] ; Simmen et al . , 2002 ; Fields et al . , 2007 ) . These cargos are either segre - gated into glycolipid rafts ( HA ) or may interact with adaptor proteins that are recruited to the TGN such as AP - 4 ( LDLR [ Y18A ] ; Simmen et al . , 2002 ; Fullekrug and Simons , 2004 ; Fields et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , cargos moving from the TGN into RE during biosynthetic delivery to the plasma membrane are vesicular stom - atitis virus glycoprotein ( VSVG ) , an apical variant of VSVG ( A - VSVG ) , and a truncated version of LDLR ( LDLR - CT27 ; Ang et al . , 2004 ; Fields et al . , 2007 ; Gravotta et al . , 2007 ) . At RE , cargos destined for the basolateral membrane frequently rely on the epithelial cell - specifi c adaptor complex AP - 1B for sorting ( F ö lsch , 2005 ; Fields et al . , 2007 ) , whereas cargo des - tined for the apical membrane may segregate into Rab11 - positive apical RE before being delivered to the apical membrane ( Mostov et al . , 2003 ; Thompson et al . , 2007 ) . Other transmem - brane proteins such as the TGN resident protein TGN38 may travel through RE after internalization from the plasma mem - brane on their way back to the TGN ( Ghosh et al . , 1998 ) . Despite our increasing knowledge of proteins that traffi c between the TGN and RE , we know virtually nothing about the proteins regu - lating this step . T o maintain polarity , epithelial cells continuously sort transmembrane proteins to the apical or baso - lateral membrane domains during biosynthetic delivery or after internalization . During biosynthetic de - livery , some cargo proteins move from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) into recycling endosomes ( RE ) before be - ing delivered to the plasma membrane . However , pro - teins that regulate this transport step remained elusive . In this study , we show that Rab13 partially colocalizes with TGN38 at the TGN and transferrin receptors in RE . Knockdown of Rab13 with short hairpin RNA in human bronchial epithelial cells or overexpression of dominant - active or dominant - negative alleles of Rab13 in Madin - Darby canine kidney cells disrupts TGN38 / 46 localization at the TGN . Moreover , overexpression of Rab13 mutant alleles inhibits surface arrival of proteins that move through RE during biosynthetic delivery ( vesicular stom - atitis virus glycoprotein [ VSVG ] , A - VSVG , and LDLR - CT27 ) . Importantly , proteins using a direct route from the TGN to the plasma membrane are not affected . Thus , Rab13 appears to regulate membrane trafﬁ cking be - tween TGN and RE . Rab13 regulates membrane trafﬁ cking between TGN and recycling endosomes in polarized epithelial cells Rita L . Nokes , 1 Ian C . Fields , 1 Ruth N .

We noted that the signal intensity of total VSVG also decreased , which perhaps indicates a missorting into lysosomes . Therefore , we incubated the cells with lysosomal inhibitors ( 50 μ M ammonium chloride ) and proteasomal inhibitors ( 3 mM MG132 ) to inhibit protein degradation during the chase . This treatment enhanced the signal for VSVG without restoring surface deliv - ery ( Fig . S1 A , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200802176 / DC1 ) . Overall , we observed impaired surface delivery in 98 % of cells analyzed expressing Rab13Q67L and in 97 % of cells expressing Rab13T22N ( Fig . S1 C ) . To test whether Rab13 functions before or after VSVG moves into the Golgi , coverslip - grown MDCK cells were co - injected with cDNAs encoding VSVG - CFPts045 and V5 - Rab13 mutants . Cells were incubated at 39 ° C for 2 h followed by 2 h at 20 ° C in the presence of CHX . During the 20 ° C incubation , VSVG exited the ER and became trapped in the Golgi . Specimens were fi xed and immunolabeled for the cis - Golgi marker GM130 , GFP , and V5 - Rab13 . There was no discernible difference in the transport of VSVG into the Golgi as judged by colocalization of VSVG and GM130 in control cells and those coinjected with Rab13 mutants ( Fig . 1 D ) . Colocalization was observed in virtu - ally 100 % of cells analyzed independent of Rab13 overexpression . Thus , Rab13 may function in surface delivery of proteins down - stream of the Golgi . To narrow down which post - Golgi traffi cking steps might be regulated by Rab13 , we tested the effect of Rab13 over - expression by microinjection on the surface delivery of other re - porter proteins . First , we analyzed LDLR - CT27 , which is sorted to the basolateral membrane similar to VSVG ( Fig . 2 A , 3 and 3b ; Fields et al . , 2007 ) . We found that surface delivery of LDLR - CT27 was severely inhibited by both Rab13Q67L ( 93 % of cells analyzed ) and Rab13T22N ( 90 % of cells analyzed ) overexpres - sion ( Figs . 2 B and S1 C ) . Next , we tested LDLR ( Y18A ) and FcR , receptors that are thought to travel directly from the TGN to the basolateral surface independent of AP - 1B function ( Fig . 2 A , 1 ; Roush et al . , 1998 ; Fields et al . , 2007 ) . Overexpression of Rab13 mutants had no effect on surface delivery of LDLR ( Y18A ) or FcR ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Finally , we tested infl uenza HA and an apical mutant of VSVG ( A - VSVG ) . Although the HA protein is sorted directly from the TGN to the apical membrane ( Fig . 2 A , 2 ; Schuck and Simons , 2004 ) , A - VSVG moves through RE ( Fig . 2 A , 3 and 3a ; Ang et al . , 2004 ) . We found no inhibition of surface delivery for HA in the presence of overexpressed Rab13 mutants ( Fig . 2 E ) . In contrast , overexpression of Rab13Q67L or Rab13T22N se - verely inhibited surface delivery of A - VSVG ( Fig . 2 F ) . Again , we found decreased fl uorescent signals of A - VSVG in the cells . However , as was the case for VSVG , inhibition of protein deg - radation with ammonium chloride ( 50 μ M ) and MG132 ( 3 mM ) raised the signal intensity without rescuing surface delivery ( Fig . S1 B ) . The lack of surface arrival for A - VSVG was observed in 100 % of cells analyzed expressing Rab13Q67L and in 100 % of cells analyzed expressing Rab13T22N ( Fig . S1 C ) . Collectively , we found that cargos that travel to the surface via RE ( LDLR - CT27 , VSVG , and A - VSVG ) were stalled within In general , membrane traffi cking is regulated by small GTPases of the Ras superfamily . For example , in yeast , the Rab protein Sec4p regulates exocytic transport to the emerging bud ( Novick and Guo , 2002 ) . Among the closest mammalian homo - logues of Sec4p are Rab8 , Rab10 , and Rab13 ( Pereira - Leal and Seabra , 2001 ; Collins , 2005 ; Buvelot Frei et al . , 2006 ) . In polar - ized epithelial cells , Rab8 plays a role in exocytosis of AP - 1B – dependent cargo from the RE to the basolateral membrane ( Ang et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , Rab8a activity is necessary for the outgrowth of the primary cilium ( Nachury et al . , 2007 ; Yoshimura et al . , 2007 ) . Likewise , Rab10 regulates endosomal sorting of internalized cargos ( Babbey et al . , 2006 ; Chen et al . , 2006 ) , and / or surface delivery of newly synthesized basolateral cargos ( Schuck et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , Rab13 seems to regulate tight junction integ - rity . In MDCK cells stably expressing dominant - active Rab13Q67L but not dominant - negative Rab13T22N , mutants delayed tight junction formation ( Marzesco et al . , 2002 ) . This effect might be caused by impaired endocytic recycling of the tight junction proteins claudin - 1 and occludin , and down - regulation of PKA activity ( Marzesco et al . , 2002 ; Yamamoto et al . , 2003 ; Kohler et al . , 2004 ; Morimoto et al . , 2005 ) . However , these studies did not address whether Rab13 might also play a role during bio - synthetic delivery of transmembrane proteins . Here , we show that Rab13 regulates surface delivery of cargos that travel through RE during biosynthetic delivery . Results and discussion To test whether Rab13 affects cell polarity , we microinjected V5 - tagged Rab13Q67L or V5 - tagged Rab13T22N cDNAs into fi lter - grown , fully polarized MDCK cells . Neither Rab13Q67L nor Rab13T22N overexpression disrupted basolateral localiza - tion of the marker protein gp58 ( Fig . 1 A ) . [ ID ] FIG1 [ / ID ] Furthermore , tight junction assembly as judged by ZO - 1 staining and cilium bio - genesis were not affected ( Fig . 1 B ) . Therefore , within the short times ( 4 h ) of overexpression achieved by microinjection , the overall polarity is unaffected , in contrast to previous studies , which were based on prolonged overexpression ( > 24 h ) of Rab13 mutants ( Marzesco et al . , 2002 ; Morimoto et al . , 2005 ) . Using microinjection , we asked whether Rab13 mutants have any effects on surface delivery of VSVG . As a transmem - brane protein , VSVG passes through the canonical biosynthetic pathway , from the ER and Golgi to the TGN . It then traverses the RE , from which it is sorted to the basolateral membrane in the AP - 1B pathway ( Fig . 2 A , 3 and 3b ) . [ ID ] FIG2 [ / ID ] Filter - grown MDCK cells were coinjected with cDNAs encoding Rab13 mutants and a CFP - tagged , temperature - sensitive mutant of VSVG ( VSVG - CFPts045 ; Toomre et al . , 1999 ) . Cells were incubated for 2 h at the nonpermissive temperature of 39 ° C , at which VSVG accu - mulated in the ER , whereas Rab13 mutants were produced in the cytosol . To release VSVG from the ER for surface delivery , cells were shifted to 31 ° C for 2 h in the presence of cyclohex - imide ( CHX ) to prevent further protein synthesis . VSVG localized at the plasma membrane was detected with antibodies recogniz - ing its ectodomain before fi xation . Cells were then fi xed , per - meabilized , and stained for Rab13 and total VSVG .

Rab13 colocalized with AP - 1A at the TGN in 97 ± 7 % of cells analyzed ( Fig . 3 A ) . [ ID ] FIG3 [ / ID ] Note that although Rab13 did not colocalize entirely with AP - 1A , almost all AP - 1A staining colocalized with Rab13 . In addition , Rab13 partially colocal - ized with AP - 1B in RE in 76 ± 15 % of cells analyzed ( Fig . 3 B ) . We then analyzed Rab13 staining versus TGN38 ( a marker for AP - 1A – positive TGN ) and transferrin receptor ( TfnR ; a marker for AP - 1B – positive RE ) in the same cells ( F ö lsch et al . , 2003 ) . Again , Rab13 partially colocalized with both TGN38 ( 98 ± 3 % of cells analyzed ) and TfnR ( 95 ± 8 % of cells analyzed ; Fig . 3 C ) . Furthermore , we found no colocalization between Rab13 and GM130 ( not depicted ) . In addition to TGN / RE localization , the cells upon overexpression of Rab13 mutants . In contrast , cargos not traversing the RE , such as the basolateral cargos LDLR ( Y18A ) and FcR as well as the apical cargo HA , were not affected . Because both VSVG and its apical variant A - VSVG were affected , Rab13 appears to function between the TGN and RE , as opposed to regulating post - RE traffi cking pathways , which are different for VSVG and A - VSVG . Because Rab13 appears to function at the TGN or RE , we sought to determine its detailed intracellular location . To this end , we used defective adenoviruses to express low levels of wild - type , GFP - tagged Rab13 ( GFP - Rab13 ) in MDCK cells grown on coverslips . Coinfection with defective adenoviruses encoding GFP - Rab13 and μ 1A - HA or μ 1B - myc was used to Figure 2 . Rab13 overexpression affects selective cargos .

S3 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200802176 / DC1 ) . Notably , cells transiently overexpressing Rab13Q67L for prolonged times may compensate by express - ing more GM130 , as judged by its more intense GM130 stain - ing ( Fig . S3 A ) . Although this phenotype prevented us from using defective adenoviruses for biochemical analysis , this fi nd - ing might reconcile our data with the published literature . Over time , disruption of the Golgi may lead to polarity defects . In ad - dition , overexpression of Rab13Q67L may lead to tight junction defects perhaps caused by enhanced delivery of activated Rab13 to the tight junctions . Importantly , our study is the fi rst one to demonstrate any phenotype for the Rab13T22N allele . There - fore , it seems likely that Rab13 ’ s primary function may be in controlling membrane traffi cking between TGN and RE . To confi rm Rab13 ’ s effects on the TGN by an indepen - dent assay , we knocked down Rab13 in human bronchial epi - thelial ( HBE ) cells ( the 16HBE14o (cid:3) strain was used ) . Like MDCK cells , this cell line expresses Rab13 and μ 1B based on RT - PCR , and fully polarized HBE cells sort LDLR - CT27 to the basolateral membrane and grow out a single primary cilium ( unpublished data ) . In addition , HBE cells form ZO - 1 contain - ing tight junctions ( Kizhatil et al . , 2007 ) . We obtained three GFP - tagged short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) constructs target - ing Rab13 and one control construct targeting glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) from Thermo Fisher Scientifi c . To test knockdown capacities , shRNA constructs were transfected into HBE cells together with a dual expres - sion plasmid encoding both monomeric red fl uorescent protein ( mRFP ) and T7 - tagged Rab13 from different promoters . 48 h after some Rab13 stained the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3 , A and C , arrows ; Marzesco et al . , 2002 ) . Because Rab proteins localize to both donor and acceptor membranes ( Collins , 2003 ) , the partial localization of Rab13 at the TGN and RE supports our hypoth - esis that Rab13 functions at the interface between TGN and RE in addition to its described function at the tight junctions ( Marzesco et al . , 2002 ) . Next , we tested whether overexpression of Rab13 mutants might affect the TGN . We coinjected Rab13Q67L or Rab13T22N cDNAs together with TGN38 cDNAs into MDCK cells grown on coverslips . TGN38 is localized at the TGN in cells co - injected with an unrelated plasmid ( mRFP - FcR cDNA ; Fig . 4 A ) , whereas coexpression of Rab13Q67L or Rab13T22N dispersed TGN38 localization ( Fig . 4 B and not depicted ) . [ ID ] FIG4 [ / ID ] This phenotype was observed in 97 % of cells analyzed for Rab13Q67L and (cid:2) 80 % of the cells analyzed for Rab13T22N ( Fig . 4 E ) . In addi - tion , TGN38 might be misrouted into lysosomes because stain - ing intensities also decreased . This effect was specifi c because overexpression of Rab13 mutants by microinjection had no dis - cernible effect on the localization of GM130 , (cid:2) - adaptin ( AP - 1A and AP - 1B ) , TfnR , or AP - 3 ( Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200802176 / DC1 , and not depicted ) . Interestingly , the TGN marker protein furin was also not af - fected upon overexpression of Rab13 mutants by microinjec - tion ( Fig . S2 D ) , which indicates that perhaps only a subdomain of the TGN is affected by Rab13 or that only the retrieval path - way of TGN38 , but not the retrieval pathway of furin , is inhib - ited by Rab13 overexpression . Prolonged overexpression of Rab13 for 24 h by transient transfection disrupted the entire Golgi , as judged by a more dis - Figure 3 . Intracellular localization of Rab13 . MDCK cells grown on coverslips were infected with defective adenoviruses encoding GFP - V5 - Rab13 wild type together with defective adenoviruses encoding μ 1A - HA ( A ) , μ 1B - myc ( B ) , or TGN38 ( C ) . 24 h ( C ) or 36 h ( A and B ) after infection , cells were ﬁ xed and stained for HA , myc , TfnR , or TGN38 . Arrows ( A and C ) indicate plasma membrane localization of Rab13 . For quantiﬁ cation , cells were scored for at least partial overlapping staining . Data ( see text ) are mean values from at least four independent experiments ( μ 1A - HA , 30 cells ; μ 1B - myc , 65 cells ; TfnR , 65 cells ; TGN38 , 61 cells ) , and errors indicate SD .

[ ID ] FIG5 [ / ID ] We then calculated values for Rab13 knockdown as described in Materials and methods . Constructs Rab13 Nos . 1 and 3 decreased Rab13 ex - pression by 87 and 82 % ( Fig . 5 A ) , respectively , whereas con - struct No . 2 was not effective ( not depicted ) . Next , we tested the effect of Rab13 knockdown on endogenous TGN46 and GM130 . We observed a disruption and / or loss of TGN46 stain - ing in (cid:2) 57 % of cells analyzed for construct No . 1 and in (cid:2) 80 % of cells analyzed for construct No . 3 ( Fig . 5 B ) . These data indicate that Rab13 is indeed necessary for the mainte - nance of TGN38 / 46 localization at the TGN . Interestingly , as was the case with prolonged Rab13 overexpression , knock - down of Rab13 also led to a disruption / loss of GM130 stain - ing in 43 % of cells analyzed for construct No . 1 and 62 % of cells analyzed for construct No . 3 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Recently , it was shown that Rab13 knockdown in MDCK cells disrupted tight junctions ( Yamamura et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , it seems that prolonged overexpression and knockdown of Rab13 share the same phenotypes in disrupting TGN38 / 46 and GM130 local - ization at the TGN / Golgi together with impairing tight junctions . This is in contrast to acute overexpression by microinjection , which leaves the tight junctions and the Golgi mainly intact . Previously , Rab8 and Rab10 , close homologues of Rab13 , were shown to result in apical missorting of VSVG upon over - expression of mutant Rab proteins ( Ang et al . , 2003 ; Schuck et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , the inhibition of surface delivery is unique to Rab13 . To test whether Rab13 may have an equally unique function in TGN38 localization , we injected cDNAs encoding Rab8 or Rab10 mutants together with plasmids encoding TGN38 into MDCK cells and analyzed TGN38 localization . Neither Rab8Q67L nor Rab10Q68L or Rab10T23N had any discernible effects on TGN38 localization in > 90 % of cells analyzed ( Fig . 4 , C – E ; and not depicted ) . Interestingly , when Rab8T22N was coinjected with TGN38 cDNA , (cid:2) 50 % of the cells lacked TGN38 staining ( Fig . 4 E ) . Note , during biosynthetic delivery of AP - 1B cargos , only Rab8Q67L , but not Rab8T22N , showed any effects on basolateral delivery from RE ( Ang et al . , 2003 ) . However , because Rab8 localizes in RE ( Ang et al . , 2003 ) , over - expression of Rab8T22N might interfere with retrieval pathways back to the TGN from early endosomes through RE . Regardless , the effects on TGN38 localization are most pronounced upon overexpression of both Rab13 mutants , indicating that Rab13 ’ s effects on TGN38 are specifi c for Rab13 . In summary , Rab13 clearly differs from its homologues Rab8 and Rab10 with respect to two key assays . First , over - expression of Rab13 mutants inhibited surface delivery in the biosynthetic pathway of both apical and basolateral cargos that move through RE as opposed to apical missorting of AP - 1B – dependent cargos ( Ang et al . , 2003 ; Schuck et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , Rab13 appears to operate at an earlier membrane traffi cking step distinct from Rab8 or Rab10 . Second , in con - trast to Rab13Q67L , neither Rab8Q67L nor Rab10Q68L showed any effects on TGN38 localization at the TGN . Having es - tablished a role for Rab13 at the interface between TGN and RE , we can now begin to analyze Rab13 ’ s interplay with known regulators of the TGN . Figure 4 .

Immunoﬂ uorescence microscopy In general , cells were ﬁ xed in 3 % PFA for 15 min at RT followed by an incu - bation in PBS 2 + ( PBS [ 0 . 2 g / liter KCl , 0 . 2 g / liter KH 2 PO 4 , 8 g / liter NaCl , and 2 . 17 g / liter Na 2 HPO 4 × 7 H 2 O ] plus 0 . 1 g / liter CaCl 2 and 0 . 1 g / liter MgCl 2 × 6 H 2 O ) for 5 min . Subsequently , cells were incubated for 1 h in a blocking / permeabilization solution ( BPS ; 2 % [ wt / vol ] BSA and 0 . 4 % [ wt / vol ] saponin in PBS 2 + ) with 10 % [ vol / vol ] goat serum . Cells were then incu - bated for 1 h with primary antibodies in BPS , followed by 5 washes over 30 min with BPS . Finally , cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies ( often isotype speciﬁ c ) in BPS , followed by ﬁ ve washes in BPS . Cells were mounted in a solution containing 10 % [ wt / vol ] DABCO and 50 % [ wt / vol ] glycerol . For cell surface staining , cells were incubated with primary antibod - ies for 1 h on ice followed by washes with ice - cold PBS 2 + before ﬁ xation . Specimens were analyzed at room temperature using a confocal microscope ( Microsystem LSM 510 with ConfoCor3 software ) equipped with a 63 × water immersion lens ( all from Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) . Images were combined and enhanced using Photoshop ( Adobe ) . For quantiﬁ cation of shRNA knockdown , HBE cells were cotrans - fected with shRNA constructs and pBUDCE4 encoding mRFP and T7 - Rab13 24 h after seeding . 48 h after transfection , cells were ﬁ xed , permeabi - lized , and stained for T7 - Rab13 . Images of specimens were taken under the same confocal settings , and mean pixel intensities were obtained using 510 ConfoCor 3 software ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) . We then determined the ratio between T7 - Rab13 and mRFP signals . The mean ratio of cells coexpressing a control shRNA construct targeting GAPDH was set 100 % , and the values of knockdown for the Rab13 shRNA constructs were determined as per - centage values of the control .
