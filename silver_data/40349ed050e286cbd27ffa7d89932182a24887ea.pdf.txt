Wingfield Tests of association between the humoral immune response of red - winged blackbirds ( Agelaius phoeniceus ) and male plumage , testosterone , or reproductive success Received : 17 July 2002 / Revised : 18 December 2002 / Accepted : 8 January 2003 / Published online : 15 February 2003 (cid:1) Springer - Verlag 2003 Abstract We explored the potential relationships be - tween male traits , reproductive success , testosterone levels in the breeding season , and humoral immunocom - petence in male red - winged blackbirds ( Agelaius phoeni - ceus ) . Males responded to a single injection of diphtheria - tetanus vaccine by producing antibodies to both antigens . The primary responses to each antigen were positively correlated with each other , but the relationship was clearly non - linear . No male responded strongly to diph - theria without also responding strongly to tetanus , but many males had strong responses to tetanus and weak responses to diphtheria . Response to tetanus was posi - tively associated with hormone levels , whereas the relationship between testosterone and the response to diphtheria was weakly and nonsignificantly negative . We found no convincing relationships between immune responses and male morphological traits ( epaulet size , body blackness , and body size ) , male success in male - male competition ( territory size and tenure ) , or male reproductive success ( number of mates , average clutch size , proportion of offspring sired , or proportion of young fledged ) . These results do not support testosterone acting as a constraint on immunity . Testosterone could be mediating a condition - dependent trade - off between sexual ornaments and the immune system , but the evidence for this was weak , as neither any male sexual trait nor any measure of performance was associated with immune responses . We could not eliminate the possibility that male sexual traits advertise other aspects of immunity that are not dependent upon condition or hormones . Keywords Antibodies · Hormones · Immunocompetence handicap · Sexual selection · Signals Introduction Conspicuous secondary sexual characteristics , typically in males , are commonplace among animals ( e . g . , Andersson 1994 ) . A provocative hypothesis for their function is that they signal the health of their bearer ( Hamilton and Zuk 1982 ) and therefore the potential value to females of that male as a sire of offspring . Folstad and Karter ( 1992 ) proposed an intriguing mechanism for how sexual signals might be linked with the ability to fight off disease . They suggested that steroid hormones might reciprocally influence the magnitude of the immune response and the signal . Testosterone could act as a constraint by enhancing the signal and depressing the immune system . This hypothesis predicts negative relationships between immunocompetence and both testosterone and sexual signals ( Verhulst et al . 1999 ) , with high quality males being those who could resist parasites even when having reduced immune responses ( Saino et al . 1999 ) In outlining their hypothesis , Folstad and Karter ( 1992 ) did not explain how this hormonal duality would remain evolutionarily stable . Wedekind and Folstad ( 1994 ) pointed out that this idea implies a non - adaptive effect of testosterone , which would not be evolutionarily stable , and suggested that both the immune system and signal could depend on a common aspect of condition . This is a different idea from the original Hamilton and Zuk ( 1982 ) hypothesis in which the signal was condition - dependent , but the immune system was not ( Westneat and Birkhead 1998 ) . In Wedekind and Folstad’s ( 1994 ) view , hormones that increase sexual signals but decrease immunocompe - tence could be part of a mechanism for adaptively allocating resources to both tasks . This hypothesis would predict a negative effect of testosterone on immunocom - Communicated by W . Searcy D . F .

Indeed , Peters ( 2000 ) found a negative effect of testosterone implants on a single measure of immunity in captive superb fairy wren ( Malurus cyaneus ) males , but a positive correlation between natural testos - terone and immunity in free - living males . A meta - analysis revealed a generally negative relationship be - tween immune response and advertisement in a variety of organisms ( Møller et al . 1999 ) , but other recent studies have been equivocal ( Zuk and Johnsen 1998 ; Saino et al . 1999 , 2002 ; Gonzalez et al . 1999 ; Ohlsson et al . 2002 ) . The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis pro - posed by Folstad and Karter ( 1992 ) and elaborated upon by Wedekind and Folstad ( 1994 ) makes an important assumption about influences on the immune system . Both versions , whether involving a non - adaptive mechanism of simultaneous effects or an adaptive mechanism of allo - cation , assume that the response to any pathogen is influenced by the same factors . Testosterone should have effects across most immune responses , and if the under - lying trade - off is condition - dependent , then variation in condition ( e . g . , energy stores , nutrients ) should have similar effects on the immune responses to any pathogen ( e . g . , Westneat and Birkhead 1998 ) . Several components of the immune system do appear to be condition - dependent in some species ( e . g . , Lochmiller et al . 1993 ; Hasselquist et al . 2001 ) . In some studies different components of immunity show correlated responses ( e . g . , Parmentier et al . 1996 ; Hoi - Leitner et al . 2001 ) whereas in others they do not ( e . g . , Zuk and Johnsen 1998 ) . However , most studies have used only a single measure of immunity or have not looked for correlated responses among immune components . Here , we report an analysis of the putative relation - ships between plumage traits , testosterone , and immune function in a free - living population of red - winged black - birds ( Agelaius phoeniceus ) . Red - winged blackbirds are a marsh - nesting species in which sexual selection is a potentially strong evolutionary force due to social polyg - yny ( e . g . , Searcy and Yasukawa 1995 ; Beletsky and Orians 1996 ) and to a lesser extent , extra - pair copulations ( Westneat 1993 ; Weatherhead and Boag 1995 , 1997 ; Webster et al . 1995 ) . Early in the season , males dispute territory boundaries via song and display ( Nero 1984 ) . Such disputes diminish but persist at a moderately high frequency until after most females have settled and laid eggs ( Nero 1984 ; Searcy and Yasukawa 1995 ) . Levels of circulating testosterone peak correspondingly early in the season , but remain high throughout the breeding season ( Beletsky et al . 1989 , 1992 ) . As with many territorial birds , testosterone rises quickly in response to social challenges but is dependent on mating system and breeding strategy ( Johnsen 1998 ) . The distinctive plumage of male redwings , in partic - ular the bright red and yellow wing patches ( epaulets ) , have been implicated as a signal in both male - male interactions and in female choice ( e . g . , Yasukawa 1981 , Hansen and Rohwer 1986 ; Eckert and Weatherhead 1987 ; Røskaft and Rohwer 1987 ; Milks and Picman 1994 ) . Less attention has been given to the black body plumage of males , which is also sexually dimorphic and varies noticeably among males during the breeding season . In either case , we know little about the information poten - tially contained in these signals . The size of the epaulet or the quality of the black body plumage could reflect the ability to acquire resources during molt . How hormone levels influence these traits is not known , but they develop in the fall ( Meanley and Bond 1970 ) when testosterone levels are at their lowest of the year ( Beletsky et al . 1989 ) . Finally , both traits might reflect the health of the male . Parasite levels in one population were not associated with epaulet size ( Weatherhead 1990 ; Weath - erhead et al . 1993 ) , but we do not have data on how immune responses covary with plumage . Our study had three major goals . First , we compared the relationship between testosterone and immunocom - petence in free - living blackbirds with the results of Hasselquist et al . ( 1999 ) , who found no effect of experimental doses of testosterone on antibody produc - tion in captive males . Second , because a major assump - tion of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis is that a general aspect of the immune system is affected by testosterone , we tested the prediction that humoral immune responses to two different antigens would be correlated . Finally , different forms of the immunocom - petence handicap hypothesis predict different correlations between immune responses and male traits and perfor - mance . Hence we assessed these relationships in free - living blackbirds as a first step toward identifying the mechanisms underlying possible links between immunity , sexual signals , hormones , and performance in this species . Methods Study population We studied a population of red - winged blackbirds breeding within a large freshwater marsh located about 2 km north east of Drakesboro , Muhlenberg Co . , Kentucky . Details of the study site are reported in Westneat et al . ( 1998 ) , but briefly the area is a large cattail marsh ( approximately 3 km 2 ) within a shallow lake formed from a coal - mining settling pond . The data reported here arose from efforts focused on approximately 100 male territories established at the north end of the marsh in the spring of 1997 . During this period , water levels throughout the study site ranged from 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 m and were kept constant during the summer . The study site was marked out in a 30(cid:2)30 m grid using 2 m poles , allowing us to effectively map male territorial boundaries and nest locations accurately . General field methods In late March , we identified male territorial boundaries by scanning the marsh and marking the locations of song perches and boundary disputes on maps of the marsh . Many of the males had been captured and color - banded in previous seasons and could be identified early in the season . New territory owners were typically unbanded individuals that made territory ownership early in the season difficult to assign . We placed walk - in treadle traps on poles 316 in some territories and baited them with a handful of cracked corn every several days . Males were allowed to forage freely within the unset traps , until the small amount of food placed there ran out , for 3 days to 2 weeks . Then , individual males were targeted for capture by setting the traps in their territories and baiting with a handful of corn for a couple of days . Males were trapped between 15 April and 8 May , corresponding to a time of flux in male territory boundaries and female settlement . First eggs were laid on most territories during 5 – 15 May . Once captured , we banded males if necessary , and measured both tarsi , both wings , and tail length , traced both epaulets onto acetate overlays for calculations of epaulet size , and scored the extent of non - black in the black plumage on their backs and under the tail . Non - black plumage consists of brown or white tips on the feathers . These are largest just after molt and wear away through the year ( Meanley and Bond 1970 ) . However , males vary considerably in the extent of non - black tips in the spring . We scored non - black on the back or under the tail using two measures , the percentage of feathers containing some non - black tips and the length of the largest spot of non - black . We also took about 300 (cid:3)l of blood from the brachial vein , mixed it with 15 (cid:3)l of a heparin solution , and stored the tube on ice . We then injected 100 (cid:3)l of children’s diphtheria - tetanus vaccine ( obtained from Pasteur Merieux Connaught ) into the pectoralis muscle on both sides of the body ( to achieve 200 (cid:3)l total without putting too large a volume in one location ; 2 . 7 lf of diphtheria toxoid and 2 lf of tetanus toxoid ) . This relative dosage of the two antigens is set for optimal antibody production in humans . We used a volume scaled up from Ilmonen et al . ( 2000 ) to account for the larger body size of red - winged blackbirds . After injection , the bird was then released back onto its own territory . Then , 9 or 10 days later , we re - set the traps on the territories of focal males and attempted to recapture them . In most cases , we recaptured the male on the first day we tried , but some males took longer to catch and in a few cases males were caught earlier than expected in a trap located on a neighbor’s territory . Within 5 min of recapture , we sampled another 300 (cid:3)l of blood and released the bird . Blood samples were stored on ice and centrifuged later the same day . We removed the plasma and stored it in three separate tubes that were immediately frozen . Two of the tubes were used for the antibody analysis and one for testosterone assay . The pelleted red blood cells were resuspended in a Tris - NaCl - EDTA buffer and also frozen . Measurement of antibody levels We shipped the frozen serum samples to Lund University , Sweden for measurement of antibody levels . We used essentially the same protocol for running kinetics enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) as described in Hasselquist et al . ( 1999 , 2001 ) , Ilmonen et al . ( 2000 ) and R(cid:4)berg et al . ( 2000 ) with a few minor changes . This method provides sensitive measures of the amount of passerine antibodies that specifically bind to a certain antigen ( here diphtheria or tetanus toxoid ) . We used a diluent of 1 % powdered milk in 0 . 01 phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , pH 7 . 2 ) to produce for each pre - and post - immunization serum sample , 1 : 1 , 500 and 1 : 3 , 000 dilutions for diphtheria , and 1 : 3 , 000 and 1 : 6 , 000 dilutions for tetanus . On each plate we ran eight standard samples covering the whole range of antibody titers for the immunized males , and we used the standard curve to account for between - plate differences . To obtain a measure of an individual’s antibody production against an antigen , we subtracted its pre - immunization titer ( i . e . its background level of antigen - specific antibodies ) from its post - immunization titer . Antibody production against tetanus toxoid was in all cases higher in post - than pre - immunization samples , whereas for antibody production against diphtheria toxoid this was true in all cases except two ( these were then set to zero in the analyses ) . For each antigen , we used the mean value for the two dilutions as the measure of the antigen - specific antibody production . Measurement of testosterone levels We shipped one tube of frozen serum for each capture of a male to the University of Washington , Seattle , Washington for hormone analysis . Testosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay . Plasma was equilibrated with 2 , 000 cpm of tritiated testosterone ( to estimate percent recovery after processing and assay ) for 2 h , extracted in redistilled dichloromethane and dried under a stream of nitrogen . Extracts were re - constituted in phosphate - buffered saline with gelatin and assayed in duplicate . Standard curves covered the range 1 . 9 to 500 pg and intra - assay variation was less than 10 % . All samples were processed in one assay to avoid inter - assay variation . For full details of the general procedures , see Ball and Wingfield ( 1986 ) or Wingfield et al . ( 1991 ) . Paternity analyses We isolated DNA from red - blood cells using proteinase K digestions and phenol - chloroform extraction . DNA concentration was adjusted to 5 ng / (cid:3)l and amplified using PCR on a thermal cycler . We added 5 (cid:3)l of DNA solution to 15 (cid:3)l of a master mix containing 0 . 5 mM forward ( labeled with AT 32 P ) and reverse primer , 1(cid:2)PCR buffer , 0 . 2 mM dNTPs , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 10 ng bovine serum albumin , and 0 . 5 units of Taq polymerase . PCR reactions were hot - started at 94(cid:5)C for 3 min , followed by one round of annealing for 30 s and extension at 72(cid:5)C for 1 min , which was then followed by 29 cycles of 94(cid:5)C for 30 s , annealing for 30 s , and 72(cid:5)C for 45 s . Five primer pairs were found to amplify polymorphic regions in the Kentucky population of redwings . Four pairs were developed for use in other species and include Fh U2 ( Ficedula hypoleuca ; Primmer et al . 1996 ; annealing temperature was 56(cid:5)C ) , LTMR6 ( long - tailed manakin ; Chiroxiphia linearis ; McDonald and Potts 1994 , annealing temperature was 54(cid:5)C ) , Mau 10 ( Molothrus ater ; Gibbs et al . 1997 , annealing temperature was 56(cid:5)C ) and Qm 10 ( Quiscalus mexicanus ; Hughes et al . 1998 , annealing temperature was 56(cid:5)C ) . We developed a fifth primer pair , RW54 , from red - winged blackbird DNA ( unpublished data , annealing temperature was 60(cid:5)C ) . Most samples were analyzed with Fh U2 , LTMR6 , and RW54 with Qm 10 and Mau 10 added for assignments and cases with ambiguous information from the other three . Amplified DNA was run in family groupings on 6 % polyacry - lamide gels . Gels were removed from glass plates onto filter paper and dried for 2 – 3 h . We exposed X - ray film to dried gels for 1 – 3 days . Autoradiographs were developed , and bands scored in reference to size standards from an allelic ladder run 4 – 5 times on each gel . We considered the social mother and father at each nest to be the genetic parents if the offspring’s genotype matched both at all three loci . If the offspring did not match one parent at more than one locus , and that parent was the male , then we considered it a case of extra - pair paternity . Because null alleles , mutation , and scoring errors may result in occasional mismatches , we used a fourth primer in cases of a mismatch at only one locus . If the new information produced an additional mismatch with the male , then we concluded the offspring was sired through extra - pair fertiliza - tion . Data analysis Thirteen of the males used in the analyses were also part of a separate experiment not reported here involving plumage manip - ulations . Briefly , males were subjected to one of four possible treatments at initial capture : ( 1 ) some black feathers were bleached and then dyed black ( controls , n = 4 ) ; ( 2 ) the black plumage on their back or under their tail was bleached and some nearby black feathers treated with black dye ( lightened , n = 4 ) ; ( 3 ) some feathers were bleached and then all non - black feathers , including the bleached ones , dyed black ( blackened , n = 2 ) ; or ( 4 ) epaulets were treated with a dilute black dye ( dulled epaulet , n = 3 ) . Treatment had no effect on either immune response or testosterone . Thus , we retained these males in the analyses to maintain sample size . 317 Data were analyzed using Statview 4 . 0 ( Abacus Concepts ) and SAS 8 . 0 ( SAS ) . We combined morphological measurements using principal components analysis . Wing length , tarsus length , and tail length were all positively correlated with each other and with the first principal component ( loadings 0 . 89 , 0 . 49 , 0 . 91 , respectively , eigenvalue = 1 . 86 ) . We used this principal component as a measure of body size in all analyses . The four scores of non - black plumage were also positively correlated with each other and with the first principal component ( loadings ranged between 0 . 48 and 0 . 82 , eigenvalue = 2 . 17 ) . We used this component as an inverse measure of body blackness . Results Antibody measures We injected a total of 67 males with the diphtheria - tetanus antigens and recaptured and sampled 44 of them 6 – 16 days later . The antibody levels for both antigens were low in control samples taken before injection , and the birds responded to both antigens by producing antibodies ( Fig . 1 ) . The difference in levels between captures ( antibody response ) was not normally distributed for either antigen ( diphtheria , Kolmogorov - Smirnoff D = 0 . 38 , P < 0 . 01 ; teta - nus , D = 0 . 21 , P < 0 . 01 ) . Log transformation marginally normalized the diphtheria response ( D = 0 . 13 , P = 0 . 08 ) but not the tetanus response ( D = 0 . 25 , P < 0 . 01 ) . When possi - ble , we thus used non - parametric statistics to analyze antibody response , but when parametric analyses were required , we used the log - transformed values . The levels of antibodies detected after injection were not correlated with the levels before injection ( diphtheria , Kendall’s tau = 0 . 08 , P = 0 . 45 ; tetanus , tau = (cid:6)0 . 10 , P = 0 . 33 ) . However , the interval between injection and resampling differed between males . Longer delays resulted in higher antibody titers for both antigens ( Fig . 2 ; diphtheria , tau = 0 . 40 , P < 0 . 01 ; tetanus , tau = 0 . 29 , P < 0 . 01 ) . A polyno - mial regression analysis of log - transformed values re - vealed insignificant squared terms for both antigens ( diphtheria , std . coefficient = (cid:6)0 . 26 , t = (cid:6)0 . 24 , P = 0 . 81 ; tetanus , std . coefficient = (cid:6)1 . 79 , t = (cid:6)1 . 54 , P = 0 . 13 ) . Thus , even though antibody levels are expected to increase initially over time and then decrease , within the times we resampled , this curved response was not a major expla - nation for variation in response . We calculated residuals from the linear relationship between delay to recapture and log of antibody response for both antigens and used this in subsequent nonparametric analyses . We still found no relationship between control levels of antibody and response levels ( controlling for the delay ) for tetanus ( Kendall’s tau = (cid:6)0 . 06 , P = 0 . 56 ) and a weak but non - significant relationship for diphtheria ( tau = 0 . 18 , P = 0 . 08 ) . If the birds had been previously exposed to either diphtheria or tetanus , they should have had some antibodies in their blood before injection and our injections should have caused a large secondary response . Taken together , then , our results suggest that most male red - winged blackbirds had not been exposed to either diphtheria or tetanus previously and that we measured primary responses to both antigens . The response of males to the simultaneous injection of two antigens was intriguing . A prediction of condition - dependent models of immune trade - offs ( e . g . , Westneat and Birkhead 1998 ) is that multiple components of the immune system should be inter - correlated . Indeed , the level of tetanus antibodies was positively correlated with the level of diphtheria antibodies whether we used raw Fig . 1 Antibody titer ( mOD / min ) measured before ( control ) and 6 – 16 days after injection ( primary response ) for diphtheria and tetanus antigens ( n = 44 ) . Bars represent standard errors ( too small to be seen for controls ) Fig . 2 Effect re - sampling interval on antibody titer ( in mOD / min ) in response to A diphtheria antigen and B tetanus antigen ; n = 44 318 values ( tau = 0 . 36 , P < 0 . 001 ) or the values corrected for days since injection ( tau = 0 . 29 , P < 0 . 001 ) . Fig . 3 indicates that this is not a linear relationship . In fact , all the males that responded strongly to diphtheria also responded strongly to tetanus . However , some males that responded strongly to tetanus did not respond or responded only weakly to diphtheria . Testosterone measures We were able to collect sufficient plasma to measure testosterone titers for 33 males upon initial capture ( before injection of antigen ) and 28 males upon recapture 6 – 16 days later . For 21 of these males , we obtained measures of testosterone ( T ) from both captures . T levels averaged 2 . 7€1 . 25SD ng / ml on first capture and 2 . 22€1 . 56 ng / ml at the second capture , and were not significantly different ( Paired t = 0 . 82 , df = 20 , P > 0 . 42 ) . Testosterone titers were not associated from one sampling to the next ( r = 0 . 16 , P > 0 . 50 ) . The response to diphtheria ( controlling for days until recapture ) was not associated with testosterone titer before injection , at the time of resampling , or averaged over both samplings ( Table 1 ) . By contrast , the response to tetanus was positively associated with testosterone levels , significantly so with the level before injection and the average level over both captures ( Table 1 ) . Antibody levels and morphological traits We found few significant correlations between either immune response and three main morphological traits potentially involved in sexual selection ( Table 2 ) . Neither type of antibody was related to body size , to epaulet size , or to male age . The response to diphtheria was signifi - cantly positively associated with the amount of non - black on the male’s body plumage , but the response to tetanus was not and correction for multiple tests would increase the P - value of the diphtheria test to above 0 . 05 . These same analyses performed using a composite ( sum ) of both antibody measures produced no significant associations ( data not shown ) . Antibody production and male - male competition We analyzed the relationship between two measures of success at male - male competition and the immune response . Males had to persist on their territory for at least 7 days to have their antibody responses measured and so we include only males that were successful at defending a territory during a key period of the breeding season . There was , however , variation in how many total days males remained on their territories . Territory tenure ( days from first to last sighting ) was not associated with either immune response ( diphtheria , tau = (cid:6)0 . 15 , n = 40 , P = 0 . 17 ; tetanus , tau = 0 . 12 , n = 42 , P = 0 . 28 ) . Similarly , male territory size measured from biweekly compilations of daily territory maps , averaged over his tenure , was not associated with either immune measure ( diphtheria , tau = 0 . 005 , n = 41 , P = 0 . 96 ; tetanus , tau = 0 . 12 , n = 43 , P = 0 . 26 ) . A composite of both antibody measures pro - Table 1 Relationship between testosterone titer at two capture times and antibody production in response to diphtheria or tetanus antigens in male red - winged blackbirds ( Agelaius phoeniceus ) .

Antibody production and components of reproductive success In 1997 , we followed a total of 87 males who had acquired at least one female nesting on their territory . All but one of the 44 males who had their immune response measured attracted at least one nesting female . We analyzed the relationships between antibody production and components of reproductive success for these males . We found no associations between either measure of antibody production and any of the components of reproduction we measured ( Table 3 ) . A composite measure of antibody production was also not associated with any of these variables ( data not shown ) . Antibody production and survival Our survey of territorial males in 1998 revealed that at least 19 of the 44 males whose immune responses had been assayed in the previous year returned . The proba - bility a male returned was not related to his immune response to diphtheria ( logistic regression , c 2 = 0 . 59 , P > 0 . 4 ) , to tetanus ( c 2 = 0 . 39 , P > 0 . 5 ) , or to both measures combined ( c 2 = 0 . 72 , P > 0 . 4 ) . Discussion We found that testosterone titer was positively associated with antibody production for one antigen but not another in males that were in the midst of actively defending territories and attracting females . This result from free - living birds is generally consistent with evidence obtained from manipulated captive individuals of this species ( Hasselquist et al . 1999 ) and suggests that natural variation in testosterone does not inhibit immune re - sponses to novel antigens . We did not find relationships between immunocompetence and male sexual traits ( epaulet size , body size , and black body plumage ) or between immunocompetence and measures of male - male competitive ability or reproductive success . Together , these findings do not support the predictions of the testosterone - mediated immunocompetence handicap hy - pothesis proposed by Folstad and Karter ( 1992 ) . The relevance of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis to some types of traits has been questioned because many sexual signals ( such as many plumage traits in birds ) develop when steroid hormones are at their lowest levels of the year ( Owens and Short 1995 ; Hillgarth and Wingfield 1997 ) . We analyzed three sexually dimorphic traits in redwings , two of which were plumage traits known to develop when testosterone is at its lowest . The third was body size , a trait fixed in red - winged blackbirds within the first month of life when testosterone is likely to be low . Thus these traits in red - winged blackbirds may seem ill suited for the immuno - competence handicap hypothesis . Nevertheless , such traits could provide information about trade - offs involving hormones . First , if hormone levels in fall are correlated with those in spring , then plumage could be informative about the hormone - immu - nity trade - off . Second , signals involved in male - male interactions could be condition - dependent rather than hormone - dependent , but could provide information about the ability of a male to escalate aggression or to win in wars of attrition ( e . g . , Rohwer 1975 ; Enquist 1985 ; Grafen 1990 ) . Steroid hormones are known to influence such contests ( e . g . , Wingfield et al . 1990 ) and parasite levels are associated with aggression ( Weatherhead 1990 ) . If the immunosuppressive effect of testosterone is condition dependent ( i . e . , high quality males suffer less from the effect of testosterone because of their higher condition ) , then a condition - dependent signal could provide information about the level of aggression a male is willing to display ( see also Hasselquist et al . 1999 ) . If so , then males successful in male - male competition might be those males best able to withstand the costly effects of high testosterone . We performed a crude test of this idea by examining correlates of success at defending a territory during the breeding season . We found no evidence that such defense was linked with immunocompetence . Moreover , neither measure of territorial defense correlated with average testosterone levels ( tenure , tau = 0 . 02 , P = 0 . 88 , n = 40 ; territory size , tau = 0 . 03 , P = 0 . 79 , n = 41 ) . These results raise doubts that male plumage traits signal a condition - dependent trade - off between immunity and aggression Table 3 Rank correlations be - tween index of immune re - sponse to diphtheria or tetanus and components of reproductive success of male red - winged blackbirds .

There are some potential concerns about our analyses that might limit our conclusions . One is that there may actually be a relationship between some of these variables that we did not detect due to small sample sizes or large sampling error . Our sample sizes are indeed modest , and the variance in antibody production is high . In the case of the relationship between testosterone and antibody pro - duction , statistical power was no doubt low . The observed effect for diphtheria was in the direction predicted by Folstad and Karter ( 1992 ) , so it is possible that testoster - one inhibits the response to diphtheria . However , the response to tetanus with respect to testosterone titer was significantly positive , making it highly unlikely for a negative relationship between the two to actually exist . We also found no relationship between antibody production and any plumage traits or any components of reproductive success . If we take the liberty of using parametric statistics , in most of the tests we conducted , the power of detecting an r of 0 . 5 was greater than 0 . 9 . In the case of male signals , this means we probably could detect one that predicts at least 25 % of the variance in immunocompetence . Whether or not a trait that predicts only 25 % of the variance in an attribute is a very useful signal is not known but probably depends on the costs of female preference . Smaller correlations between some of the variables we surveyed ( e . g . , between immunocompe - tence and reproductive success or survival ) could be biologically important . The power of our tests to detect a correlation less than 0 . 2 was low , less than 0 . 5 . Thus we may have missed detecting some important relationships . We also acknowledge that our study relies entirely on measuring associations between variables . Given the complexity of the potential links between signals , hormones , and immunity , correlational studies are sus - ceptible to a myriad of effects from unmeasured variables ( Verhulst et al . 1999 ) . One particular problem is that we found no evidence that testosterone levels are repeatable within males . This is probably due to the flexible response of testosterone to momentary changes in social interac - tions ( Wingfield 1985 ) . It is possible that such variation masks average effects of testosterone over time . However , our results on testosterone and immunity are consistent with an experimental study of captive males that also found no influence of testosterone on immune response ( Hasselquist et al . 1999 ) . It remains possible for attractive males occupying preferred territories to have a higher immunocompetence but also to suffer more stress - induced immunosuppression ( R(cid:4)berg et al . 1998 ) due to higher reproductive effort ( e . g . , display rate , aggression , matings ) . Hence , the lack of associations does indicate that if immunity is linked with sexual signals or reproductive success , the relationship is more complex than is usually assumed . We measured just the primary immune response and screened this response at only one point in time . Important variation in immunity could occur at other steps in the immune system . For example , variation may exist in the cellular response , in the latency of the primary response or in the quality of memory leading to strength and speed of the secondary immune response . Indeed , since the secondary response is much stronger , variation could be greater and might be more important to health . We were unable to assess such possibilities in this study . We did find some evidence of Wedekind and Folstad’s ( 1994 ) idea that testosterone may be part of a mechanism mediating allocation of resources to immunity and signal production . That idea predicts that differences in condi - tion among males might produce a positive correlation between immunocompetence and testosterone . Indeed , we found that the response to tetanus was positively associ - ated with testosterone . We could not assess male condi - tion effectively , and so the possibility that both immunity and hormone level reflect condition remains to be tested in this species . However , one intriguing result of our study was the nonlinear association between the responses to the two antigens . This result is not consistent with an important assumption of the immunocompetence handicap hypoth - esis . In both Folstad and Karter’s ( 1992 ) original hypothesis , and Wedekind and Folstad’s ( 1994 ) condi - tion - dependent version , there is an implicit assumption that hormones affect similarly the immune responses to any pathogen . We found that antibody production was hierarchically related ( males responded to diphtheria only if they responded to tetanus , but not vice - versa ) , and the effect of testosterone on diphtheria antibodies differed from that found with tetanus . Our results thus support a more complex view of immunity , similar to the seasonal differences in immune responses and their correlates reported by Zuk and Johnsen ( 1998 ) . Although such complexity does not eliminate general mechanisms like that presented by Folstad and Karter ( 1992 ) , it does make the use of novel antigens a potentially misleading tool for investigating simple versions of such ideas . For example , suppose red - winged blackbirds were currently under selection to fight off tetanus . Use of diphtheria antigens to measure the immune response may provide little useful information relevant to any trade - offs involved in responding to tetanus . The cost of effectively responding to tetanus cannot even be measured by using diphtheria antigens because the response to diphtheria is usually at a different scale from that to tetanus . Thus , even though novel antigens are very useful , the results obtained from their use must be interpreted with caution given the complexity of the immune system and the array of pathogens faced by the organism . The hierarchical response to the two antigens is intriguing and raises some interesting questions about the organization of the immune system . The result is consistent with a view that the humoral immune system is likely to be shaped by selection to be more effective against pathogens that are likely to be encountered or have more fitness consequences . Clostridium tetani , the bacteria that causes tetanus , is common in the environ - 321 ment , particularly soils exposed to livestock manure ( Shone and Hambleton 1989 ) . In humans , the bacteria can cause disease if they enter a wound ( Christie 1980 ) . Diphtheria is caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheria , is resident in respiratory tracts , and is transmitted through the air ( Hermann and Weaver 1970 ) . There is little information on the presence of either Clostridium tetani or Corynebacterium diphtheria in birds . However , we would predict that tetanus is of greater risk , and if so , the stronger immune response to tetanus would thus make adaptive sense . In summary , our results add to a growing literature on the relationships between sexual signals , testosterone , and immune responses . We are able to reject some hypotheses as unlikely in the case of the red - winged blackbird and our results also provide some additional insight into the complexity of the immune system . Red - winged black - birds do not fit the immunocompetence handicap model as originally described ( Folstad and Karter 1992 ) . Whether or not plumage traits and hormones are linked in some other way with the immune system remains to be seen .
