Articles 64 | VOL . 12 NO . 1 | JANUARY 2015 | nAture methods Fluorescent ca 2 + reporters are widely used as readouts of neuronal activities . here we designed r - camP2 , a high - affinity red genetically encoded calcium indicator ( Geci ) with a hill coefficient near 1 . use of the calmodulin - binding sequence of camKK - a and camKK - b in lieu of an m13 sequence resulted in threefold faster rise and decay times of ca 2 + transients than r - camP1 . 07 . these features allowed resolving single action potentials ( APs ) and recording fast AP trains up to 20 – 40 hz in cortical slices . somatic and synaptic activities of a cortical neuronal ensemble in vivo were imaged with similar efficacy as with previously reported sensitive green Gecis . combining green and red Gecis , we successfully achieved dual - color monitoring of neuronal activities of distinct cell types , both in the mouse cortex and in freely moving Caenorhabditis elegans . dual imaging using r - camP2 and green Gecis provides a powerful means to interrogate orthogonal and hierarchical neuronal ensembles in vivo . Fluorescent reporters of Ca 2 + signaling have been widely used as pre - and postsynaptic readouts of neuronal activities . However , the need to deliver chemical Ca 2 + indicators , such as Fluo - 4 or Oregon Green BAPTA ( OGB ) - 1 , via a patch pipette or with an acute bulk loading protocol under lipophilic conditions , puts strong con - straints on subsequent imaging conditions . GECIs circumvent these constraints and potentially enable long - term , repetitive and unbiased functional imaging of hundreds of neurons in vivo 1 , 2 . Fluorescent GECIs can be divided into two classes . Fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - based Ca 2 + sensors such as yellow cameleons 3 , 4 employ ratiometric intramolecular FRET between the N - terminal and C - terminal fluorescent proteins as Ca 2 + readout . This effect is mediated by the calcium - dependent interaction of the attached calmodulin ( CaM ) and an M13 peptide sequence taken from the Ca 2 + / CaM - binding domain of a skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase . However , single - color GECIs such as G - CaMPs or GCaMPs are based on circularly permutated ( cp ) fluorescent protein peptide halves that are linked to CaM and M13 sequences 5 – 10 ( Fig . 1a ) . A series of random , targeted or 3D structure – based mutagenesis , performed in several laboratories , led to a gradual increase in the Ca 2 + - dependent brightness of the G - CaMP / GCaMP series of green GECIs 8 , 11 – 14 . Thus , the calcium - saturated fluorescence intensity of GCaMP6s in the presence of Ca 2 + is comparable to that of the parental cp - EGFP itself 13 . Parallel Ca 2 + recording from many neurons within a field of view with single - AP resolution , however , requires fast kinetics of Ca 2 + - induced fluorescence changes . Some trade - offs have been attempted between the sensitivity and the fast kinetics in sev - eral G - CaMP and GCaMP mutants 12 , 13 , 15 . Because of substantial structural differences in the fluorophores of GFP and RFP , optimi - zation of RFP - based red GECI designs have lagged behind those of GFP - based sensors , particularly in the areas of fast kinetics and high signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) 8 , 16 – 18 . We previously reported that subthreshold synaptic activity robustly triggered CREB phosphorylation via a CaMKK - CaMKIV pathway in hippocampal neurons 19 , 20 . Furthermore , neurotrophin BDNF application strongly promoted dendritogenesis in imma - ture cortical neurons via a CaMKK - CLICKIII / CaMKI γ pathway 21 . These findings suggested that the molecular structure of upstream CaMK kinase , CaMKK - α and CaMKK - β , contained a versatile Ca 2 + - sensing mechanism that was efficiently turned on during bio - logically relevant rises in calcium in the neuronal cytoplasm 22 . Here we report the design of R - CaMP2 , a red GECI that takes advantage of the high - affinity Ca 2 + / CaM sensor built into CaMKK - α and CaMKK - β 23 . R - CaMP2 is the first red GECI that enables monitor - ing of an active neuronal ensemble with efficacy comparable to that of green GECIs . We further demonstrate the utility of R - CaMP2 in dual - color functional mapping of neuronal activities of distinct cell types , in the mouse cortex and in freely moving C . elegans . resultsdesigning high - affinity red ca 2 + indicator r - camP2 We hypothesized that ckkap , a peptide sequence responsible for binding Ca 2 + - bound CaM within the primary structure of rational design of a high - affinity , fast , red calcium indicator r - camP2 Masatoshi Inoue 1 , 2 , Atsuya Takeuchi 3 , Shin - ichiro Horigane 1 , Masamichi Ohkura 4 , Keiko Gengyo - Ando 4 , Hajime Fujii 1 , Satoshi Kamijo 1 , 2 , Sayaka Takemoto - Kimura 1 , 5 , Masanobu Kano 3 , Junichi Nakai 4 , Kazuo Kitamura 3 , 5 , 6 & Haruhiko Bito 1 , 2 1 Department of Neurochemistry , Graduate School of Medicine , University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan . 2 Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology ( CREST ) , Japan Science and Technology Agency , Tokyo , Japan . 3 Department of Neurophysiology , Graduate School of Medicine , University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan . 4 Brain Science Institute , Saitama University , Saitama , Japan . 5 Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology ( PRESTO ) , Japan Science and Technology Agency , Saitama , Japan . 6 Present address : Department of Neurophysiology , Division of Medicine , University of Yamanashi , Yamanashi , Japan .

We directly tested this idea using R - CaMP1 . 07 ( ref . 16 ) and R - GECO1 ( ref . 8 ) as starting GECI backbones ( Fig . 1b ) and replacing the M13 peptide with ckkap . We further introduced mutations both into the CaM sequence to promote brightness and normalized fluorescence 10 , 13 and into the ckkap sequence at five residues that are divergent between CaMKK - α and CaMKK - β ( Fig . 1a ) . Collectively , we expressed 150 mutant recombinant candidate proteins in HEK293 cells , purified and screened them for lower Ca 2 + dissociation constants ( K d ) in vitro and for relatively low baseline fluorescence compared to R - CaMP1 . 07 and high ∆ F / F under saturating Ca 2 + concentrations in vitro ( Fig . 1c , d and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Of the 150 mutants that we examined ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , two , hereafter termed R - CaMP2 and R - GECO2L ( ‘L’ stands for ‘low calcium range’ ) , showed promising characteristics and were further character - ized . Both had K d values in the < 100 nM ranges ( Fig . 1c ) and showed sizable ∆ F / F ( > 400 % ) ( Fig . 1d ) while revealing < 2 - fold increase in baseline fluorescence against R - CaMP1 . 07 controls ( Fig . 1d ) . We then expressed these mutants in cultured rat hippocampal neurons . Red indicator fluorescence was clearly separated from control volume - filling GFP signals ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Similarly to R - CaMP1 . 07 and consistently with other green GECIs , R - CaMP2 showed extranuclear localization ( Fig . 2a ) , whereas R - GECO2L localized to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus ( Fig . 2b ) and would thus be more useful for applica - tions where nuclear Ca 2 + imaging is desirable . Furthermore , both indicators showed diffuse distribution in dendrites ( Fig . 2a , b ) , axons and boutons ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Strikingly , R - CaMP2’s ∆ F / F response amplitudes showed a > 3 - fold increase over R - CaMP1 . 07 in cultured neurons and appeared to be superior to R - GECO2L ( Fig . 2c , d ) . r - camP2 kinetics in vitro and in cultured neurons In vitro characterization showed that the fluorescence spectra of R - CaMP2 and R - GECO2L were similar to those of R - CaMP1 . 07 ; the excitation and emission peaks were , respectively , 565 nm and 583 nm for R - CaMP2 , and 563 nm and 581 nm for R - GECO2L , in the presence of Ca 2 + ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . The two - photon cross - section of R - CaMP2 peaked at around 1 , 120 nm but was still > 60 % of the peak at 1 , 020 – 1 , 040 nm , a wavelength window compatible with classical titanium - sapphire ( Ti : sapphire ) two - photon laser excitation ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . The p K a curve of R - CaMP2 ( with Ca 2 + ) showed a small but markedly leftward shift as compared to R - GECO1 or R - CaMP1 . 07 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 and Table 1 ) . The extinction coefficient , quantum yield and brightness of R - CaMP2 were comparable to or slightly greater than those of R - CaMP1 . 07 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Finally , the relaxation rate constant ( K obs ) , a general index of the kinetic speed of reaction , showed a 2 - to 3 - fold increase in the physiological c 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 ( F – F m i n ) / ( F m a x – F m i n ) 0 . 2 0 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 Ca 2 + ( µ M ) 1 10 100 R - CaMP2 R - GECO2L R - CaMP1 . 07 a b CaMKK - α ( ckkap ) CaMKK - β ( ckkbp ) ckkap - WL R - CaMP1 . 07 Sensor variants R - CaMP2 M13 ckkap - WL ckkap - WL CaM N380S D381Y T382R S384T R - CaMP1 . 07 R - GECO1 T303G N380S D381Y T382R S384T Mutation Origin R - GECO2L R - CaMP2 MGS M13 cpApple CaM F2A ckkap - WL cpApple CaM F2A MGS d Baseline F ∆ F / F 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 R - C a M P 1 . 07 R - C a M P 2 R - G E C O 2L B a s e li ne f l uo r e sc en c e c o m pa r ed t o R - C a M P 1 . 07 20 15 10 ∆ F / F 5 0 0 Figure 1 | Design and in vitro characterization of R - CaMP2 .

Furthermore , the calcium binding to R - CaMP2 and R - GECO2L was accompanied with Hill coefficients close to 1 ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2 ) , similar to val - ues shown for chemical Ca 2 + indicators such as OGB - 1 ( ref . 24 ) . This is in clear distinction to previously published GCaMPs , G - CaMPs or R - CaMP , which have Hill coefficients exceeding 1 . 5 ( Table 1 ) . In cultured neurons , both single action potential ( 1AP ) delivery via electrical field stimulation 19 ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 5a – c ) and single nanosecond - pulse UV laser uncaging of MNI - glutamate near the soma ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) 25 generated robust Ca 2 + tran - sients that conformed to single exponential fitting . Consistently with the in vitro kinetic measurements , and although R - CaMP2 and R - GECO2L showed much higher affinity for Ca 2 + than published GECIs in vitro ( Table 1 ) , we found that both new red indicators revealed rise and decay kinetics of Ca 2 + transients in living neurons that were much faster compared to R - CaMP1 . 07 ( Supplementary Figs . 5b , c and 6a , b ) . high - frequency AP recording with r - camP2 in brain slices To test R - CaMP2’s utility in brain tissue , we introduced R - CaMP2 plasmids into barrel cortex layer 2 / 3 neurons via in utero electroporation 26 and cut acute slices in adult mice . Using a Ti : sapphire laser tuned at 1 , 040 nm for excitation , we performed fast two - photon line - scan Ca 2 + imaging up to 700 Hz near the soma and proxi - mal dendrites of a visualized neuron , and under a whole - cell patch - clamp configura - tion ( Fig . 3a ) .

We observed improvements in SNR ( fourfold higher ) , the rising time - to - peak ( 2 . 6 - fold faster ) and the decay time constant ( 3 . 4 - fold faster ) ( Supplementary Fig . 7a – d ) . Consistently with these enhanced parameters , successive pulses of current injections up to four pulses demonstrated improved ∆ F / F amplitude and SNRs ( Fig . 3c ) such that we resolved cumu - lative steps of Ca 2 + transients generated by successive pulses of AP trains even with a single trial up to 20 – 40 Hz ( Fig . 3d , e and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Under the same experimental conditions , Ca 2 + signals recorded from R - CaMP1 . 07 – expressing neurons showed larger baseline noise while also revealing a slower rise in fluorescence , thus blurring AP detection above 5 Hz ( Fig . 3d , e and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . imaging suprathreshold and subthreshold activity in vivo These results raised the possibility that R - CaMP2’s enhanced per - formance may be suitable for functional mapping of neuronal circuits in vivo , to a degree similar to what has been achieved with bright fast green GECIs , such as GCaMP6f or G - CaMP8 . To directly test this , we carried out in vivo Ca 2 + imaging in layer 2 / 3 neurons in the barrel cortex of anesthetized , head - fixed mice ( Fig . 4a ) . Membrane properties of R - CaMP2 – expressing neurons were normal ( Supplementary Fig . 9a , b ) , and 1AP - evoked Ca 2 + transient kinetics were indistinguishable , irrespective of the mode of expression ( constitutive ( with a CAG promoter ) or transient ( with a Tet - on system ) ) ( Supplementary Fig . 9c , d ) . Neither gross morphological abnormalities ( such as aberrant dendritic or axonal extensions , mispositioned cell bodies or migration defects ) , nor increases in cell death were associated with R - CaMP2 expression , even when driven downstream of a CAG promoter ( Supplementary Fig . 10a – f ) . Under conditions where ~ 30 – 60 % of cortical layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons were transfected with a CAG - driven R - CaMP2 expression plasmid , we reliably recorded spontaneous Ca 2 + spikes for extensive periods of time ( typically up to several hours after the start of our recording ) in almost all visualized neurons ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Video 1 ) . However , the delivery of air puffs on the whiskers triggered evoked Ca 2 + transients in only a limited population of neurons ( Fig . 4b ) , in keeping with the sparsely coded nature of tactile information 27 , 28 . Active neurons that showed stimulus - correlated activity based on R - CaMP2 – based Ca 2 + transients showed robust evoked responses upon exposure to sequential air - puff events , indicating that we successfully identified neurons of an active neuronal ensemble in the barrel cortex 27 ( Fig . 4c ) . The brightness of somatic R - CaMP2 signals in vivo prompted us to perform dendritic spine Ca 2 + imaging in layer 2 / 3 dendrites in vivo . We asked whether R - CaMP2 imaging could be employed to distinguish temporal profiles of subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic Ca 2 + transients ( EPSCaTs ) in spines and of resulting dendritic Ca 2 + spikes within active neurons ( Fig . 4d ) . We routinely observed subthreshold EPSCaTs ( Fig . 4d , e and Supplementary Videos 2 and 3 ) ; some were generated in the absence of detectable fluorescence signals in the adjacent dendritic shafts ( Fig . 4d , e ) , but in other cases , the onset of a localized EPSCaT within a spine preceded that of a dendritic spike occurring in the adjacent dendritic shaft ( Fig . 4d , e ) . What makes R - CaMP2 so sensitive to synaptic and cellular neuronal activities , despite its inferior maximal ∆ F / F of R - CaMP2 under saturating Ca 2 + concentrations as compared to R - CaMP1 . 07 ( Fig . 1d and Table 1 ) ? We hypothesized that the combination of high Ca 2 + affinity ( Fig . 1c ) and a Hill coefficient close to 1 ( Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2 ) , in the context of a faster relaxation rate constant ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , could cause a c e d Air puff 1 . 0 s 1 . 0 ∆ F / F s1 d1 d2 s1 1 2 • • • • • • 3 s2 s3 s4 d1 d2 d3 d4 0 10 20 Time ( s ) 2 . 0 ∆ F / F d3 d4 s2 s3 s4 2 1 5 8 Air puff 2 . 0 ∆ F / F 7 6 43 0 20 # 8 # 7 # 6 # 5 # 4 # 3 # 2 # 1 40 60 80 100 120 140 Time ( s ) 1 . 0 s • • 1 s1s2d1 2 3 1 . 0 ∆ F / F 1 . 98 s 2 . 68 s 2 . 45 s 2 . 22 s 5 . 48 s 7 . 11 s 6 . 65 s 5 . 95 s 10 . 61 s 12 . 25 s 4 . 0 0 . 5 11 . 54 s 11 . 08 s ∆ F / F a b s1 s2 d1 Figure 4 | In vivo imaging of sensory - evoked calcium transients in layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons labeled with R - CaMP2 .

To test this , we performed loose - seal cell - attached electrical recording and fast line - scan Ca 2 + imaging simultane - ously 29 ( Supplementary Fig . 11a ) . Spontaneous AP trains up to five pulses showed near - linear augmentation of the recorded fluo - rescence amplitudes and integrals in vivo , with little loss of SNR ( Supplementary Fig . 11b ) . An increase in SNR on the second spike was detectable even up to 100 Hz ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these results indicate that the rise and decay kinetics of spontaneous 1AP - driven Ca 2 + transients in vivo ( Supplementary Fig . 11c , d ) were comparable to , if not faster than , the reported values for GCaMP6f 13 or fast - GCaMP 12 . dual - color imaging of active ensembles in vivo Having confirmed that R - CaMP2’s performance is comparable to that of fast green GECIs , we attempted proof - of - concept experi - ments on dual - color active ensemble recordings in the cortex of head - fixed mice , using GCaMP6 and R - CaMP2 . On the basis of the frame rate of in vivo two - photon microscopy ( 1 – 2 Hz ) , we chose two neuronal populations with intermittent bursts of rela - tively slow AP trains , CaMKII α - positive excitatory pyramidal neurons and somatostatin ( SST ) - positive interneurons . To express R - CaMP2 specifically in SST interneurons , we combined a genetically engineered mouse in which a Cre recombinase is knocked in the SST locus such that Cre expression is specific to SST - positive interneurons 30 with an adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) expression vector encoding a double loxP - flanked inverted open - reading - frame ( DIO ) R - CaMP2 ( Fig . 5a , b ) . We also used a CaMKII promoter – driven GCaMP6f AAV to drive GCaMP6f in excitatory neurons ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Consistent with prior reports that a sizable portion of SST - positive interneurons are electri - cally coupled 31 , we found SST - positive interneurons in close proximity that had overlapping R - CaMP2 responses ( Fig . 5b , c and Supplementary Video 4 ) , whereas adjacent excitatory neurons showed distinct activity ( Fig . 5d ) . We obtained simi - lar findings when the colors were switched ( GCaMP6s in SST interneurons and R - CaMP2 in excitatory neurons ) ( Fig . 5e and Supplementary Video 5 ) . Only a limited number of exci - tatory neurons showed statistically significant correlations , in contrast to a higher number of coincidental activities in SST interneurons ( Fig . 5f , g ) . To demonstrate that R - CaMP2 is well suited for all - optical interrogation of a behavioral circuit in vivo , we combined presy - naptic channelrhodopsin ( ChR2 ) stimulation with postsynaptic R - CaMP2 recording in freely moving C . elegans in the presence of all - trans - retinal ( ATR ) , a necessary ChR2 cofactor in C . elegans . ChR2 activation in ASH sensory neurons caused an increase in R - CaMP2 signal in the postsynaptic AVA interneurons , h i j 100806040200 0 10 20 0 . 5 ∆ F / F R - CaMP2 G - CaMP6 Relative body length Light on 0 . 1 R e l a t i v e bod y l eng t h Time ( s ) ATR ( – ) ATR ( + ) * * * R e s pon s e ( % ) Blue light Light OFF Light ON G - CaMP6ChR2 GABAneuron BWMs R - CaMP2 b SST : : R - CaMP2 CaMKII α : : GCaMP6f 1 2 2 1 a 1 , 020 – 1 , 030 nm SST - Cre mice AAV - CAG - DIO - R - CaMP2 CAG pro CaMKII α pro R - CaMP2 WPRE GCaMP6f WPRE AAV - α CaMKII - GCaMP6f SST EXC c SST : : R - CaMP2 ROI 1 2 0 . 2 ∆ F / F 10 s d SST : : R - CaMP2 CaMKII α : : GCaMP6f Cellno . 12 12 10 s 0 . 5 0 . 3 0 . 1 0 . 1 ∆ F / F ∆ F / F f C e ll no .

Furthermore , we expressed R - CaMP2 in body wall muscles ( BWMs ) and G - CaMP6 in the innervating GABAergic motor neurons that negatively reg - ulated body wall contractility . In addition , we expressed ChR2 in the same GABAergic neurons to enable their light - activated stimulation ( Fig . 5h , i ) . Shortly after light stimulation of the GABAergic neurons , we observed a decrease in muscle cell Ca 2 + concentration , followed by an immediate relaxation of C . elegans BWMs and immobility throughout the light stimulation period , even while the Ca 2 + level was building up in GABAergic neurons ( Fig . 5h – j and Supplementary Video 6 ) . Collectively , these experiments provide evidence that calcium imaging using R - CaMP2 in combination with ChR2 and green GECIs provides a powerful means to interrogate orthogonal active ensembles and hierarchical circuits in vivo . discussion In this study , we designed a red GECI , R - CaMP2 , which com - bines two notable in vivo properties : strong single AP signals and fast kinetics . The fast kinetics of R - CaMP2 was unexpected , as we used a Ca 2 + - sensor domain that was derived from a high - affinity Ca 2 + / CaM - binding sequence ckkp found in CaMKK 32 . Consistently with previously reported properties of ckkp 32 , Ca 2 + binding to R - CaMP2 showed high affinity ( K d for Ca 2 + < 70 nM ) interaction . Previous application of ckkp to a FRET Ca 2 + sensor yielded moderate improvement in FRET ratio but did not show any improvement in kinetics 22 . A significant improvement of R - CaMP2 over other GECIs , in keeping with properties of fast chemical Ca 2 + dyes , was that its Hill coefficient was near 1 , and the kinetic rate constant was much faster . These features are likely to facilitate sensitive detection of Ca 2 + rises , particularly at physiological ranges in the soma and at synapses . Furthermore , the availability of a high - performance red - shifted GECI will promote imaging of deep brain areas and activity mapping in large brains . We therefore anticipate that the properties of R - CaMP2 will be useful for high - resolution mapping of brain of both subthreshold ( excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) ) and suprathreshold ( dendritic spiking and AP ) events in vivo , especially in combina - tion with green GECIs and channelrhodopsins . The brightness of R - CaMP2 signals in vivo will be of particular interest in attempts to achieve dual - color fluorescence microscopy in alert animals 2 , in combination with cell - type – specific 30 , 33 – 35 and / or neuronal activity – sensitive promoters 36 – 38 . Thus , combined R - and G - CaMP imaging opens new avenues for parallel and simultaneous monitoring of cellular and synaptic networks , within distinct and interactive neuronal ensembles that are distributed in the living brain . methods Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper .

Plasmids . The original R - CaMP1 . 07 expression construct was as described 16 and R - GECO1 was obtained from R . E . Campbell via Addgene 8 . R - GECO1 was subcloned into a pCMV vector derived from pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech ) . To generate prototype R - CaMP2 or R - GECO2L series , the M13 sequence of R - CaMP1 . 07 or R - GECO1 was replaced with a Ca 2 + / CaM - binding peptide derived from rat CaMKK α Val438 – Phe463 ( ckkap ) . A hybrid sequence ( ckkap - WL ) of ckkap and the corresponding peptide in the CaMKK - β , ckkbp , was constructed by site - directed point mutation . Directed point mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis by the primer extension method . The general structure of R - CaMP2 series thus consists of ckkap - cpApple - calmodulin ( Fig . 1b ) . On the basis of the primary structures , the nominal molecular weights ( MWs ) are 60 kDa for R - CaMP2 and 52 kDa for R - GECO2L , consistent with R - CaMP1 . 07 ( ref . 16 ) and R - GECO1 ( ref . 8 ) , respectively , and this difference reflects alternative ends of the two distinct series at both N - and C - termini of the GECIs . Green GECIs such as GCaMP6 have intermediate MWs , such as 54 – 55 kDa . Coding regions of R - CaMP variants were subcloned into the pCAG vector with a CAG promoter unless otherwise stated . All constructs were verified by sequencing . Protein expression and purification . GECI variants were indi - vidually expressed in HEK293T cells , harvested using a nominally Ca 2 + - free reaction buffer ( 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mM potassium chloride , 1 mM DTT , 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Complete , EDTA - free , from Roche ) 7 and homogenized with a French press , and the obtained lysates were centrifuged at 16 , 000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C . This lysate fraction was further used for in vitro characterization and screening unless otherwise denoted . Expression of recombinant proteins in E . coli and their purifica - tion were performed as previously described 7 . Briefly , E . coli KRX ( Promega ) transformed with bacterial expression plasmids for red fluorescent GECIs were grown at 37 °C . Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0 . 1 % rhamnose and by incubating for an additional 40 h at 20 °C . The GECI proteins were purified with N - terminal histidine tags , dialyzed into a storage buffer ( 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT ) and subjected to in vitro characterization of quantum yield , pH titration , stopped - flow analysis , and two - photon cross - section . In vitro fluorometric Ca 2 + measurements . In vitro fluorometry was performed in 96 - well plates ( PerkinElmer ) with the use of a Fusion α plate reader ( PerkinElmer ) at room temperature . Filter sets used for fluorescent measurement of red Ca 2 + indicator were : excitation , ET555 / 20× ( Chroma ) ; emission , FF02 - 617 / 73 ( Semrock ) . Filter sets used for green Ca 2 + indicator : excitation , ET495 / 10× ( Chroma ) ; emission , FF02 - 520 / 28 ( Semrock ) . The dynamic range was expressed as ∆ F / F = ( F max − F 0 ) / F 0 , where F max is the fluorescence intensity at a saturating Ca 2 + concentra - tion of 0 . 3 mM , and F 0 is the fluorescence intensity measured at Ca 2 + concentration of nominal 0 in the presence of 15 mM EGTA . Ca 2 + titration experiments were performed by mixing 10 - mM solutions of K 2 H 2 - EGTA and Ca 2 - EGTA proportionally from Calcium Calibration Buffer Kit # 1 ( Life Technologies ) . The K d value and Hill coefficient were calculated by fitting according to the Hill equation using Origin Pro 7 . 5 ( Origin Lab ) . Excitation spectra ( detected at 630 nm ) and emission spectra ( excited at 540 nm ) were measured using a fluorescent spectrophotometer F - 2500 ( Hitachi ) as described previously 16 . Measurements of extinction coefficient and quantum yield . Extinction coefficient ( ε ) and quantum yield ( Φ ) were determined by comparison to R - GECO1 ( ε = 51 , 000 , Φ = 0 . 20 with saturat - ing Ca 2 + ) 8 as a standard . Absorbance and fluorescence emission spectra were measured in the KM buffer ( 100 mM KCl and 20 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 2 ) with 1 mM EGTA or 1 mM Ca 2 + - EGTA . Measurements of two - photon cross - section . Two - photon cross - section ( δ ) values were determined as reported previously 39 . Fluorescent indicator samples ( 100 µ M fluorescein in H 2 O , pH 11 or 40 µ M R - CaMP2 in a buffer ( 100 mM KCl and 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM DTT ) with 10 µ M CaCl 2 or 1 mM EGTA ) were placed in the hole of a hole slide glass ( S339929 , Matsunami ) , covered by a round # 1 micro cover glass ( Matsunami ) and sealed with grease . Specimens were set on the stage of a two - photon laser scanning microscope ( A1R MP , Nikon ) equipped with an ultra - fast laser ( InSight DeepSee , Spectra - Physics ) and observed with a water - immersion 16× / 0 . 80 numerical aperture ( NA ) objective ( Nikon ) . The microscope and light sources were controlled by NIS - Elements AR image acquisition software ( version 4 . 3 , Nikon ) . Fluorescence emission was detected with an infrared non - descanned detector in a line - scan mode using a Galvano scanner ( Nikon ) . Actual laser power at the sample position was measured with a power meter ( FieldMax2 , Coherent ) using a laser detector ( PowerMax PM10 , Coherent ) .

The p K a of both calcium - bound and calcium - free fluorescent indicators was determined by measuring the fluores - cence at different pH values as described previously 7 with minor modifications . Purified proteins were diluted 100 - fold into pH buffer ( 20 mM citrate ( for pH 5 – 6 ) , 20 mM MOPS ( for pH 6 – 10 ) ) at different pH values , containing 1 mM CaCl 2 for calcium - loaded spectra and 2 mM EGTA for calcium - free spectra . p K a values were determined from inflection point of a sigmoid fit to fluorescence versus pH . Stopped - flow photometry . Stopped - flow experiments were performed on a Unisoku RA - 401 stopped - flow spectrometer as follows . R - CaMP1 . 07 or R - CaMP2 ( in 2 mM EGTA , 100 mM KCl and 20 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 2 ) was rapidly mixed ( 1 : 1 ) with a series of Ca 2 + buffers ( 0 . 4 – 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 100 mM KCl and 20 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 2 ) . The changes in absorbance at 565 nm of R - CaMPs during rapid mixing provided the relaxation rate constants ( K obs ) for the Ca 2 + association reaction at various Ca 2 + concentrations . The obtained data were fitted to the equation K obs = K on × [ Ca 2 + ] n + K off , where K on and K off were determined as the kinetic constants of Ca 2 + association and Ca 2 + dissociation , respectively , and n was determined as the Hill coefficient . Ca 2 + imaging in dissociated hippocampal neurons . Dissociated hippocampal neurons were prepared from the CA1 / CA3 regions of the hippocampus of P0 Sprague - Dawley rats ( Japan SLC ) pups as described previously 19 , 25 with minor modifications . At 10 – 11 d in vitro , neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with plasmids encoding GECI variants under the CMV promoter . After 2 – 3 d , the neurons were subjected to field stimulation - evoked Ca 2 + imaging in Tyrode’s solution ( in mM : 129 NaCl , 5 KCl , 30 glucose , 25 HEPES - NaOH , pH 7 . 4 , 1 MgCl 2 and 3 CaCl 2 ; osmolality was adjusted to that of the conditioned culture medium ( ~ 340 mosmol / kg ) ) supplemented with 10 µ M CNQX ( Tocris Bioscience ) and 50 µ M D - AP5 ( Tocris Bioscience ) to prevent contamination from spontaneous and recurrent activity . Synaptic boutons ( located at least 100 µ m away from axon initial segment , and showing > 3 - fold enhancement in axon diameter ) were imaged using an inverted microscope ( IX81 , Olympus ) equipped with an electron multiplying charge - coupled device ( EM - CCD ) camera ( C9100 - 12 or C9100 - 13 , Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Imaging was carried out using a 100× oil - immersion objective ( UPlanSApo 100× / NA 1 . 40 , Olympus ) . Excitation filters were D490 / 10× ( Chroma ) for green excitation and ET555 / 20× ( Chroma ) for the red excitation . Emission filter was a combination of BA510IF ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( Olympus ) and multiband band - pass fluorescence filter ( FF01 - 433 / 517 / 613 ; Semrock ) for green and red channels . Neurons were maintained at 37 °C in a stage incubator ( Tokai Hit ) during all imaging sessions . Neurons were stimulated using an electrical field stimulation ( 50 mA , 1 - msec current pulses applied across the coverslip ) 19 , which was sufficient to reliably induce somatic spikes under our recording condition , with the use of a Master - 8 pulse stimulator ( A . M . P . I . ) . For UV glutamate uncaging , the neuron was imaged in Mg 2 + - free Tyrode’s solution supplemented with 0 . 4 mM MNI - glutamate ( Tocris Bioscience ) and 1 µ M tetrodotoxin . UV photolysis of MNI - glutamate was delivered by a 355 - nm UV nanosecond - pulse laser ( Polaris II , New Wave Research ) that was controlled with a UV photolysis system ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) operated on an AQUACOSMOS software platform ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) 25 . In utero electroporation . In utero electroporation was performed as described previously 26 with minor modification . Briefly , embry - onic day ( E ) 14 . 5 timed - pregnant ICR mice ( Japan SLC ) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital ( 900 mg per kilogram of body weight ( mg per kg ) ) . Approximately 1 . 0 µ l of purified plasmid ( 2 . 5 – 3 . 0 µ g / µ l final concentration ) solution was injected into the lateral ventricle of mouse embryos , and five electrical pulses ( 45 V , 50 msec duration at 1 Hz , five times ) were deliv - ered by an electroporator ( BTX ) . To visualize the mice or cells expressing GECIs , volume - filling EGFP was coexpressed with red GECIs . 4 – 7 weeks after birth , mice were subjected to acute slice preparation or in vivo imaging . Immunohistochemistry and image analysis of stained sections . To assess the cellular toxicity of R - CaMP2 – expressing neurons , activated caspase - 3 staining was done in embryonic ( E18 ) and postnatal ( P18 ) brain after in utero electroporation at E14 . Embryos were electroporated with a mixture of pCAG - R - CaMP2 and pCAG - EGFP . For control experiments , pCAG - GCaMP6f was injected together with pCAG - TagRFP . The immunohistochemis - try procedures have been previously described 26 , 36 . Briefly , mice were perfused with 4 % PFA in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer . Brains were dissected , post - fixed in the same fixatives overnight at 4 °C and immersed in 30 % sucrose in PBS . Tissues were embedded in OCT compound , immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C . For immunohistochemistry , serial 50 - µ m sections were blocked with 5 % normal goat serum , 1 % BSA , 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 and PBS for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C . Primary antibodies were rabbit antibodies to activated caspase - 3 ( 1 : 200 , Cell Signaling Technology , 9661 ) . The sections were washed three times with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature . Alexa 647 – labeled goat antibody to rabbit IgG ( 1 : 500 , Life Technologies ) was used as secondary antibody . The sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 ( Life Technologies ) to identify cortical layer . Confocal images were taken using an LSM 510META ( Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a 10× / NA - 0 . 3 air objective . Quantification of the number of transfected and activated caspase - 3 – labeled cells across the neocortical layers were performed using ImageJ software ( NIH ) . A total of three brain sections were analyzed per animal . To score images , the GFP , RFP , or activated caspase - 3 – labeled neurons were judged independently . In typical cases , 200 – 500 transfected neurons were identified from a single section . © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3185 nAture methods Simultaneous Ca 2 + imaging and whole - cell recordings in acute brain cortical slices . Acute slice experiments were conducted as previously described with slight modifications 29 . Essentially , 4 - to 7 - week - old mice were deeply anesthetized by CO 2 and decapi - tated . We expressed R - CaMP variants either under a CAG pro - moter , or with a tetracycline - inducible expression system using a TRE - tight promoter and Tet3G ( Clontech and Tet - Systems ) . Both expression vector systems gave rise to indistinguishable kinetical parameters of single AP - triggered Ca 2 + transients . For consistency , a full data set obtained using a tetracycline - inducible expression system is presented in Figure 3 . Whole brains were quickly removed and immersed in ice - cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) containing ( in mM ) 125 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 . 25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 25 glucose , and bubbled with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 . Acute coronal brain slices of the somatosensory cortex ( 250 µ m thick ) were cut using a vibrating microtome ( VT1200S ; Leica ) . Brain slices were incu - bated for 30 min in oxygenated ACSF at 30 °C and subsequently maintained at room temperature before transferring them to the recording chamber . Brain slices were mounted on the immersion - type record - ing chamber on a two - photon microscope stage , and the layer 4 of the barrel subfield was identified by bright - field imaging . Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings were performed in the layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons of the barrel cortex . During recordings , the recording chamber was continuously perfused with oxygen - ated ACSF at 30 °C . Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries using a vertical puller ( PC - 10 ; Narishige ) and had resistance of 5 – 8 M Ω when filled with the intracellular solu - tion composed of ( in mM ) ; 133 K + methylsulfonate ( K - MeSO 3 ) , 7 . 4 KCl , 10 HEPES , 3 Na 2 - ATP , 0 . 3 Na 2 - GTP , 0 . 3 MgCl 2 . Whole - cell current - clamp recordings were made using an EPC10 ampli - fier ( Heka ) . All electrophysiological data were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz . Two - photon Ca 2 + imaging using a red GECI was performed with a laser - scanning two - photon microscope ( FV1000 - MPE ; Olympus ) equipped with a pulsed laser ( wavelength : 1 , 040 nm , MaiTai HP DeepSee ; Newport Spectra - Physics ) , using a water - immersion objective ( 25× / NA 1 . 05 , Olympus ) . Fluorescence from R - CaMP2 or R - CaMP1 . 07 and EGFP were unambiguously sepa - rated into red and green channels respectively , and were detected by photomultiplier tubes ( Hamamatsu ) . Simultaneous whole - cell recordings and fast line scan Ca 2 + imaging ( sampling rate = 650 – 700 Hz ) were conducted on the soma and proximal apical dendrite of the pyramidal cells . Action potentials were evoked by current injections ( 0 . 8 nA , 2 msec duration , 1 – 8 pulses at 1 – 40 Hz ) through the patch pipette . Each trial was repeated ten times , and individual as well as average traces are presented . Passive membrane properties . Electrical membrane properties of pyramidal neurons were measured using voltage responses to a series of 500 - msec hyperpolarizing current injections ( 50 pA steps , from −200 to −50 pA ) in whole - cell current - clamp record - ings ( 20 kHz sampling frequency ) . Resting membrane potential was measured as an average membrane potential in the absence of current injection immediately after break - in . Measurement of voltage responses to current injections were made at steady state . Voltage responses were plotted as a function of injected current , and membrane input resistance was determined by the slope of the linear regression on the scatter plot . Membrane time constant was determined from single exponential curve fitted to the mem - brane voltage responses to the −50 - pA hyperpolarizing current injection . R - CaMP2 expression was driven by a CAG promoter . Layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons of the barrel cortex in the left cer - ebral hemisphere ( untransfected hemisphere ) of the same mice were used as control . AAV production and injection . All recombinant AAVs were produced using the baculovirus - Sf9 expression system as previously described 36 with the following titers : AAV2 / 1 - CAG - DIO - R - CaMP2 - WPRE ( 3 . 0 × 10 13 genomes ml −1 ) , AAV2 / 1 - CaMKII α - R - CaMP2 - WPRE ( 3 . 0 × 10 13 genomes ml −1 ) , AAV2 / 1 - CAG - DIO - GCaMP6s - WPRE ( 1 . 5 × 10 13 genomes ml −1 ) , AAV2 / 1 - CaMKII α - GCaMP6f - WPRE ( 0 . 8 × 10 13 genomes ml −1 ) . For dual - color Ca 2 + imaging in vivo , we used two combina - tions of viruses : ( i ) AAV2 / 1 - CAG - DIO - R - CaMP2 - WPRE and AAV2 / 1 - CaMKII α - GCaMP6f - WPRE ( n = 1 ) , and ( ii ) AAV2 / 1 - CaMKII α - R - CaMP2 - WPRE and AAV2 / 1 - CAG - DIO - GCaMP6s - WPRE ( n = 2 ) . Each combination of viruses was injected into SST - Cre mice ( Jackson Laboratory stock Sst tm2 . 1 ( cre ) Zjh / J , JAX 013044 ) by stereotaxic injection into the right barrel cortex ( A / P −1 . 5 mm , M / L + 3 . 0 mm from the bregma , D / V −0 . 35 mm from the pial surface ) . The viral solution was injected at a rate of 0 . 05 µ l / min up to a volume of 1 . 0 µ l , and after the injection , the pipette was held in place for an additional 10 min before removal . After 3 – 4 weeks of expression , mice were subjected to dual - color Ca 2 + imaging in vivo . Cranial window surgery for in vivo imaging . For in vivo imag - ing , mice ( 4 – 7 weeks old ) were anesthetized by intraperito - neal administration of urethane ( 1 . 5 – 1 . 8 mg per gram of body weight ( mg per gram ) ) . Throughout the experiment , the level of anesthesia was monitored by observing reflex withdrawal to the hindlimb pinch , and the body temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a heating pad ( FHC , Bowdoin ) . A custom - made stainless steel head plate was glued to the skull using super - glue and dental cement above the right barrel cortex ( centered 3 . 0 – 3 . 5 mm lateral to the midline and 1 . 5 mm posterior to the bregma ) . A circular craniotomy ( 1 . 8 – 2 . 0 mm in diameter ) was made , and the dura was carefully removed . The craniotomy was filled with 1 . 5 % agarose in solution containing the following ( in mM ) : 150 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 10 HEPES , 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 ( pH 7 . 3 ) . To suppress the motion of the exposed brain , a glass coverslip was placed over the agarose . The mouse was then transferred to the animal stage under the two - photon microscope . In vivo two - photon Ca 2 + imaging . All in vivo Ca 2 + imaging of R - CaMP2 – expressing neurons was performed in the layer 2 / 3 of the right barrel cortex ( approximately 150 – 300 µ m from the pia , n = 9 mice ) . R - CaMP2 expression was driven by a CAG promoter . We found no aberrance in neuronal morphology or intracellular GECI distribution and no significant change in AP - triggered Ca 2 + measurement kinetics in acute slices taken from similarly prepared animals , indicating that CAG promoter - driven persistent GECI expression , at least in brain tissues electroporated in utero , did not result in measurable neuronal toxicity ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Sensory stimulation was applied to contralateral whiskers by using a brief air puff ( 40 – 45 psi , 50 msec ) . Spontaneous and © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3185 nAture methods sensory - evoked activities of neuronal populations were acquired at the resolution of 256 × 192 pixels ( sampling rate = 2 . 3 Hz ) for 3 min . For fast imaging of Ca 2 + transients in single neurons , high - speed line scan ( sampling rate 650 – 700 Hz ) was performed at the soma of the cortical neurons . For dendritic imaging , a den - dritic segment with as many visible spines in one focal plane as possible was chosen , and images were acquired at the resolution of 232 × 64 pixels ( sampling rate = 4 . 3 Hz ) for 22 s . All in vivo dual - color calcium imaging of R - CaMP2 – or GCaMP6 - expressing neurons was performed in the layer 2 / 3 of the right barrel cortex ( approximately 150 – 300 µ m from the pia ) . The two - photon laser was tuned to the wavelength of 1 , 020 or 1 , 030 nm , and images were acquired using a water - immersion objective ( 25× , NA 1 . 05 , Olympus ) . Spontaneous activities of neuronal populations were acquired at the resolution of 256 × 256 pixels ( sampling rate = 1 . 8 Hz ) for 3 min . Simultaneous Ca 2 + imaging and cell - attached recordings in vivo . Loose - seal cell - attached recordings in vivo were per - formed using a glass electrode ( 5 – 7 M Ω ) filled with ACSF containing Alexa 488 ( 50 µ M ) . R - CaMP2 – expressing neurons in the barrel cortex were targeted to make cell - attached recordings by using ‘two - photon targeted patching’ procedure 40 . About 10 min after the establishment of cell - attached configura - tion , simultaneous spike recording and fast line - scan Ca 2 + imaging ( sampling rate 675 Hz ) was performed at the soma . Electrophysiological data were amplified using EPC10 amplifier ( Heka ) in current - clamp mode , filtered at 10 kHz and digi - tized at 20 kHz , and further high - pass filtered at 100 Hz offline . The spikes were detected and counted automatically by threshold - ing using custom MATLAB routines . Quantitative image analysis . Acquired time - lapse images were processed and analyzed offline with AQUACOSMOS ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) , Image J ( NIH ) , MATLAB ( MathWorks ) , Python ( http : / / www . python . org / ) , Igor Pro ( Wavemetrics ) , and Excel ( Microsoft ) . For quantitative measurements of field stimulation or UV glutamate uncaging - evoked Ca 2 + transients in cultured neurons , raw fluorescence intensities were measured in the syn - aptic boutons or somata . For UV uncaging , image frames that contained stimulus artifacts from the UV laser were automati - cally detected and removed . For slice Ca 2 + imaging , fluorescence signals in the line - scan data were smoothed with a sliding window of five points on average . We performed background subtraction before calculating ∆ F / F . ∆ F / F was calculated as ( F – F 0 ) / F 0 , where F is the fluorescence intensity at any time point and F 0 is baseline fluorescence measured 1 s before stimulation . Peak amplitude was calculated from the maximum value between the stimulus onset and 2 s after the stimulus cessation . The rise time ( t peak ) was defined as the time to peak , from the beginning of the stimulus to the time point of the maximal amplitude fluorescence . Signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) was quantified as peak ∆ F / F response over the s . d . of the baseline fluctuation during a 1 - s period immediately before stimulation . The decay time constants were determined by single exponential fit from the peak of a ∆ F / F response to the 2 s after stimulation . For population Ca 2 + imaging in the barrel cortex , regions of interest ( ROI ) corresponding to semiautomatically identifiable somata were defined using a custom - made algorithm to recognize fluorescence of R - CaMP2 or GCaMP6 . The fluorescence sig - nals of all of the pixels in each ROI were averaged and the mean fluorescence transients in each ROI were smoothened with a slid - ing window of three pixels for presentation purpose . ∆ F / F was calculated as ( F – F 0 ) / F 0 , where F is the fluorescence intensity at any time point and F 0 is the twentieth percentile of total fluores - cence intensity . Correlations of calcium signals were analyzed using customized scripts and modules written in Python programming language using NumPy . Matplotlib was used for data presentation . For simultaneous Ca 2 + imaging and cell - attached recordings , APs were detected and quantified as defined by excursion events above a threshold of 5 × σ , where σ is the s . d . of the signal dur - ing quiescent period . We searched the recording traces for spike events , as 1 – 5 APs were detected within a 0 . 2 - s window , and when no other APs were detectable during a 1 - s period before and a 1 - s period after the first AP . After the background was subtracted , the baseline fluorescence was measured over a 0 . 1 - s period before the first AP . Peak amplitude was calculated from ∆ F / F trace filtered with a median filter of window size 0 . 3 s and defined as the maxi - mum value between the stimulus onset and 1 . 2 s after the stimulus cessation . SNR was quantified as peak ∆ F / F response over the s . d . of the baseline fluctuation during a 1 - s period before stimulus onset . Integral was defined as the area under the curve ( AUC ) for a fluorescence response , and was quantified as the integrated area from the stimulus onset to 1 s after the stimulus cessation . Peak amplitude , SNR , and integral were calculated from individual trials . Rise time and decay time for 1 AP were calculated by fitting additive model kernel as follows after averaging individual trials from each cell and subsequently by filtering with a median filter of window size 0 . 05 s : f ( t ) = e + e t / t / on off −α β − − t t The parameters α , τ on , β , and τ off were adjusted to minimize the mean square error of the fit . Rise time and decay time were calculated from individual cells . Ca 2 + imaging and photostimulation in C . elegans . Psra - 6 : : ChR2 ( H134R ) : : mCherry plasmid was a gift from A . Gottschalk and S . Ramanathan . 2 . 6 kb myo - 3 ( body wall muscle ) , 5 . 1 kb nmr - 1 ( AVA ) , 1 . 9 kb unc - 25 and 1 . 2 kb of unc - 47 ( GABAergic neurons ) promoters were cloned into the pFX _ EGFPT 41 in which GFP was replaced either by R - CaMP2 , G - CaMP6 ( ref . 15 ) or ChR2 ( H134R ) . C . elegans strains were cultured under standard conditions 42 . Transgenic strains were generated by microinjection of the following DNA mixtures : jqEx456 ( Pmyo - 3 : : R - CaMP2 ( 50 ng / µ l ) ; Punc - 25 : : G - CaMP6 ( 50 ng / µ l ) ; Punc - 47 : : ChR2 : : P2A : : DsRed2 ( 50 ng / µ l ) ; Podr - 1 : : DsRed ( 50 ng / µ l ) ) , jqEx467 ( Pnmr - 1 : : R - CaMP2 ( 66 ng / µ l ) , Pnmr - 1 : : EGFP ( 33 ng / µ l , Psra - 6 : : ChR2 : : mCherry ( 66 ng / µ l ) ) . Optical stimulation and imaging were performed on a Nikon A1R laser confocal microscope ( Nikon , Japan ) . The microscope and light sources were controlled by NIS - Elements AR image acquisition software ( version 4 . 11 , Nikon , Japan ) . For triple - wavelength excitation of R - CaMP2 , G - CaMP6 , and ChR2 , three independent light sources were used . R - CaMP2 and G - CaMP6 were excited by a 561 - nm laser and a 488 - nm laser , respectively . ChR2 was activated with 440 nm blue light ( 21 nm FWHM , © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

We used low - intensity 488 - nm laser light ( 40 . 3 µ W / mm 2 ) for imaging G - CaMP fluorescence without substantially activating ChR2 . The fluorescent and transparent images were captured at 5 frames / s and a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels with an objective lens ( 20× / 0 . 75 NA , Nikon , Japan ) . Worms were placed in M9 buffer onto 1 . 5 % agar pad on glass , and covered with a cover slip 15 . The microscope stage was moved manually to track the freely moving worms . The worm’s body of each frame was extracted from background as a single ROI to measure fluorescence of the body wall muscle ( BWM ) and GABAergic neurons , using auto - tracking function of the NIS - elements AR software ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . To measure fluo - rescence of AVA , cell body of AVA and AVE interneurons was extracted as a single ROI as described previously 43 . ∆ F / F was calculated as ( F – F 0 ) / F 0 , where F is the fluorescence intensity at any time point and F 0 is the minimum fluorescence intensity . ∆ R / R was calculated as ( R − R 0 ) / R 0 , where R is the ratio at any time point and R 0 is the minimum fluorescence ratio . R was calculated as F R - CaMP2 / F EGFP , where F R - CaMP2 is the R - CaMP2 fluorescence intensity and F EGFP is the EGFP fluorescence inten - sity at any time point . Behavioral assays . Transgenic worms expressing ChR2 and con - trol N2 worms were cultivated for 18 – 24 h on NGM plates with or without all trans - Retinal ( ATR , Sigma - Aldrich ) for a final con - centration of 400 µ M . We observed the behavior response of 12 animals from each strain with or without ATR . Three trials were performed for each worm . Photostimulation was performed with 440 - nm blue light ( 0 . 10 mW / mm 2 ) as described above . To analyze the length of worm’s body from individual images , we used wriggle tracker version 1 . 1 and Move - tr / 2D version 8 . 2 ( Library Co . ) . Statistical analysis . Statistical analyses of the acquired data were done with Prism ( GraphPad ) , Excel ( Microsoft ) and R version 2 . 14 . 1 with geepack . * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ; NS , not significant ( P > 0 . 05 ) for all statistical analyses presented in fig - ures . No statistical test was run to determine sample size a priori . No data points were excluded from the analysis , and no rand - omization was carried out to determine allocation of animals or samples to experimental groups . Experimenters were not ‘blinded’ to group allocations . For slice experiments , mice were obtained from same age group . For toxicity of the R - CaMP2 experiments , controls were littermates and untransfected hemisphere on the Supplementary Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure 10 experiments , respectively . 39 .
