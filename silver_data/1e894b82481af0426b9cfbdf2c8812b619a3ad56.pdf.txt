The actin - related proteins 2 and 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex is the molecular machinethatnucleatesthesebranchedactinnetworks 3 . Thismachine is activated at the leading edge of migrating cells by Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE , also knownasSCAR ) . TheWAVE complex isitselfdirectly activated by the small GTPase Rac , which induces lamellipodia 4 – 6 . However , howcellsregulatethedirectionalityofmigrationispoorly understood . Here we identify a newprotein , Arpin , that inhibits the Arp2 / 3 complex invitro , and show that Rac signalling recruits and activates Arpin at the lamellipodial tip , like WAVE . Consistently , after depletion of the inhibitory Arpin , lamellipodia protrudefaster and cells migrate faster . A major role of this inhibitory circuit , how - ever , istocontroldirectionalpersistenceofmigration . Indeed , Arpin depletion in both mammalian cells and Dictyosteliumdiscoideum amoeba resulted in straighter trajectories , whereas Arpin micro - injection in fish keratocytes , one of the most persistent systems of cell migration , induced these cells to turn . The coexistence of the Rac – Arpin – Arp2 / 3 inhibitory circuit with the Rac – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 activatory circuit can account for this conserved role of Arpin in steering cell migration . The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated at different cellular locations by different nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , WAVE at lamellipo - dia , neural WASP ( N - WASP ) at clathrin - coated pits , and WASP and SCAR homologue ( WASH ) at endosomes 7 , 8 . NPFs share a characteri - sticcarboxy - terminaltripartite domain , referredtoastheVCA 9 . The A ( acidic ) motif binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex and induces its conforma - tional activation . Arp2 / 3 inhibitory proteins containing an A motif , PICK1 and Gadkin ( also known as AP1AR and c - BAR ) , were detected at endocytic pits and at endosomes 10 , 11 . Thus , although endocytic pits andendosomespossessantagonisticactivitiestowardstheArp2 / 3com - plex , it was not known whether lamellipodia contain a similar Arp2 / 3 inhibitory protein to counteract WAVE . To identify such a protein , we performed a bioinformatics search for proteins displaying the typ - ical A motif of human NPFs , characterized by a tryptophan residue at the antepenultimate position in an acidic context . We identified an uncharacterized protein ( C15orf38 ) clustered with NPFs with this procedure ( Fig . 1a ) . This protein was named Arpin . Arpin is encoded by a single gene in metazoans and amoeba . Predictions and NMR analysis indicate that this protein of about 220 residues is structured with the exception of its highly mobile C - terminal end , which contains the putative Arp2 / 3 - binding site ( Extended Data Figs 1 and 2 ) . Indeed , Arpin binds to Arp2 / 3 mostly through its acidic motif ( Fig . 1b and Extended Data Figs 3 and 4 ) . The molecular function of Arpin on Arp2 / 3 activity was assayed by spectrofluorimetry and total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy using purified proteins . Arpin was unable to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , consistent with its lack of verprolin ( V ) and cofilin ( C ) homology motifs . However , when Arp2 / 3 was activated by VCA , Arpin , but not its truncated form lacking the acidic motif ( Arpin D A ) , inhibited actin polymerization in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 1c ) . Theacidicpeptidewassufficientforthisinhibition , althoughitwasless effective than full - length Arpin , in line with its lower affinity for the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Extended DataFig . 4 ) . Arpininhibited Arp2 / 3activa - tion , because we observed by TIRF microscopy the generation of fewer actin branched junctions in the presence of Arpin ( Fig . 1d and Sup - plementary Video 1 ) . Full - length Arpin and its acidic motif , but not Arpin D A , competewithVCAforArp2 / 3binding ( Fig . 1eandExtended Data Fig . 4 ) . Therefore , Arpin is a new competitive inhibitor of the Arp2 / 3 complex . ThenameArpinisa mnemonicforitsactivity ( Arp2 / 3 inhibition ) . The subcellular localization of Arpin was examined by immuno - fluorescence in spreading mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) . Arpin was detected in restricted segments of the plasma membrane , which were alsostained by three lamellipodial markers—theWAVEcomplex , the Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin ( Fig . 2a and Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . Radial line scans of immunofluorescence pictures through lamellipo - dialoutlines weregenerated , registered withtheedge asa reference , and averaged to reveal the relative distributions of these different lamelli - podial components . Arpin overlapped perfectly with the distribution of the WAVE complex , a tip component 12 ( Fig . 2a ) . Arpin is thus loca - lized at the lamellipodium tip , where new actin branches are nucleated by WAVE and Arp2 / 3 complexes . As expected , Arp2 / 3 and cortactin distribution extended rearwards compared to Arpin ( Extended Data Fig . 5 ) , because Arp2 / 3 and cortactin correspond to branches of the lamellipodial actin network undergoing retrograde flow with respect to the protruding membrane 9 , 13 . To understand the regulation of Arpin activity , we examined the role of Rac , the master controller of lamellipodium formation . We co - transfected 293T cells with different forms of Rac and green fluor - escent protein ( GFP ) – Arpin and then analysed the interaction of * Theseauthorscontributedequallytothiswork . 1 GroupCytoskeletoninCellMorphogenesis , Laboratoired’EnzymologieetBiochimieStructurales , CNRSUPR3082 , Gif - sur - Yvette91190 , France . 2 InstitutdeRecherchesenTechnologiesetSciencespour leVivant ( iRTSV ) , LaboratoiredePhysiologieCellulaireetVe´ge´tale , CNRS / CEA / INRA / UJF , Grenoble38054 , France . 3 InstituteforBiophysicalChemistry , HannoverMedicalSchool , Hannover30625 , Germany . 4 InstituteofMolecularBiotechnology , Vienna1030 , Austria . 5 INSERMU1024 , CNRSUMR8197 , ENS , InstitutdeBiologiedel‘ENS , Paris75005 , France . 6 InstituteofCarcinogenesis , N .

The active form of Rac1 , which is sufficient to induce lamellipodia , was also sufficient to induce Arp2 / 3 co - immunoprecipitation with Arpin ( Fig . 2b ) . To examine whether Rac is required for Arpin activation , we used Rac1 knockout MEFs that lack lamellipodia 14 . The absence of Rac abrogated the peripheral localization of Arpin in all knockout MEF cells examined ( Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . Endogenous Arpin was then immunoprecipitated from Rac1 knockout MEFs . The Arp2 / 3 complex co - immunoprecipitated with Arpin in control MEF cells , but not in Rac - deficient cells ( Fig . 2c ) . Together , these results show that , in res - ponse to Rac signalling , Arpin inhibits the Arp2 / 3 complex at the lamellipodium tip , that is , where Rac also stimulates actin polymeriza - tion through the WAVE complex . ThiscounterintuitivefindingsuggeststhatArpinwouldbeabuilt - in brake of protrusions . Human RPE1 cells transiently transfected with short hairpin RNAs ( shRNA ) that efficiently deplete Arpin displayed increased lamellipodia - mediated cell spreading ( Extended Data Fig . 6 and Supplementary Video 2 ) . Arpin depletion increased protrusion velocity of lamellipodia , consistent with its Arp2 / 3 inhibitory role ( Fig . 2d ) . This effect was fully rescued by Arpin re - expression , but only when Arpin contained the acidic motif . Arpin thus provides a para - doxical negative circuit downstream of Rac . Such a circuitry , where Racinduces andinhibitsactin polymerization , generatesan‘incoherent feedforward loop’ ( Fig . 2e ) , which can favour temporal regulations 15 . To examine whether the Arpin circuit is physiologically relevant for cell migration , we impaired the expression of the arpin gene in zebra - fishembryosusingmorpholinos . Duringgastrulation , prechordalplate cells collectively migrate towards the animal pole . After arpin loss of function , cellmovementswerelesscoordinated ( ExtendedDataFig . 7 ) . Prechordal plate cell transplants revealed a cell autonomous effect of Arpin on protrusions . Protrusions were more frequent and more per - sistent over time in the absence of Arpin ( Supplementary Video 3 ) . This observation is consistent with the incoherent feedforward loop , a circuitry that can suppress the protrusion it creates . To understand the role of the incoherent feedforward loop in cell migration further , we performed Arpin loss - of - function experiments in cell systems migrating as individual cells . Migration of stable Arpin - depleted clones from the breast human cell line MDA - MB - 231 was analysed by video microscopy in two or three dimensions ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Videos 4 and 5 , and Extended Data Fig . 8 ) . In both cases , the tracks illustrate that Arpin - depleted cells explored a larger territory than control cells , an observation substantiated by mean square displacements ( Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . Increased exploration was not only due to increased speed , but also to increased directional persistence , measured as the ratio of the distance between two points by the actual trajectory ( Fig . 3a ) or as the direction autocorrelation function ( ExtendedDataFig . 10 ) .

Asinmammaliancells , Arpin - knockout Dictyostelium amoebaeexploredawiderterritorythanthecontrolsowingtoincreasedcellspeedanddirectionalpersistence ( Fig . 3bandSupplementaryVideo6 ) . However , directional persistence , which is more than fully rescued by GFP – Arpin expression , is the most affected parameter in amoeba . Arpin couldthusbea ‘steeringfactor’ . To testthishypothesis directly ina gain - of - functionexperiment , weselectedthe fishkeratocyte model . These cells are characterized by fast migration based on a wide fan - shaped lamellipodium with high directional persistence . We purified zebrafish Arpin and Arpin D A from Escherichia coli and microinjected these proteins into migrating trout keratocytes ( Fig . 4a ) . Injection of Arpin , but not Arpin D A , caused keratocytes to reduce their speed and deviate from their initial direction of migration ( Fig . 4b and Extended Data Fig . 10 ) . Notably , Arpin did not prevent lamellipodia protrusion , but resulted in cycles of suppression of existing lamellipodia followed byformation ofnew , ectopicones ( Fig . 4candSupplementaryVideo7 ) . Collectively , the experiments performed in different systems of cell migration support a role for Arpin in promoting cell steering : Arpin slows cells down and allows them to turn . In a computational model of efficient and persistent cell migration , the lamellipodium spatially determines where the WAVE and the Arp2 / 3 complexes will next polymerize actin , thus maintaining the front at the front over time 16 ( Fig . 4d ) . Such a feedback loop , sensing where branched actin is polymerized and activating Rac as a response , hasrecentlybeenidentified : itinvolvescoronin1AandtheRacexchange factor b - Pix 17 . In this feedback system , the WAVE complex closes a positive feedback loop that maintains efficient directional migration over time , whereas Arpin closes a concurrent negative feedback loop , which induces braking and allows turning . These two nested feedback loops , positive and negative , can account for the emergence of oscilla - tions in lamellipodium protrusion / retraction , as observed in fish ker - atocytesafter Arpin injection ( Supplementary Video8 ) , and for various travelling actin waves described in different systems 18 – 21 . Other proteins were previously shown to regulate cell steering 22 , 23 . Knockdown of Rac1 or cofilin , a protein that severs and depolymerizes actin filaments , increases directional persistence of mammalian cells 24 , 25 . These proteins are required , however , for lamellipodial protrusion and actin - based motility 26 , 27 . Arpin is unique in that it regulates cell steer - ing , while being dispensable for lamellipodial protrusion and efficient migration . Arpin is a prime candidate to fine - tune numerous physio - logical migrations biased by diverse cues 23 . Arpin also seems to have a roleinpreventingcellsfrommigrating .

Arpin was purified from E . coli as a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein and cleaved off GST . Untagged Arpin was used for in vitro assays of actin polymerization , antibody generation and keratocyte injection . Rabbit polyclonal antibodies targeting full - length Arpin were purified by affinity chromatography . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Arpin was performed using purified antibodies coupled to magnetic beads . Cells and imaging . RPE1 cells were electroporated with plasmids . Plasmids encoding fusion proteins or shRNAs were transfected into MDA - MB - 231 cells using liposomes . Lamellipodial dynamics and random migration were analysed with ImageJ using the plug - ins ‘Kymograph’ and ‘MtrackJ’ , respectively . Live - cell imaging was performed using an inverted Axio Observer microscope ( Zeiss ) equipped with two chambers controlled for temperature and CO 2 . For Arpin localization , MEF cells were fixed with 10 % TCA , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , andprocessedforimmunofluorescence . Todrawradiallinescans , acustom - made ImageJ plug - in was developed , edge was determined using ‘Isodata’ and ‘Analyze particle’ , andthena custom - madeVBA macroinExcelwasused toalign data relative to the edge . Keratocytes were isolated from scales of freshly killed brooktrout ( Salvelinusfontinalis ) andmicroinjectedwithaFemtojet ( Eppendorf ) . Plots were drawn with SigmaPlot ( SPSS ) and statistics were performed with SigmaStat ( SPSS ) .

All rights reserved ©201 3 Extended Data Figure 1 | Prediction of secondary structure elements and disordered regions of Arpin . A multiple alignment of the Arpin orthologues was performed with MUSCLE 41 and displayed with Jalview 42 . Two methods relying on multiple alignments of Arpin orthologues were used to predict secondary structures and disordered regions , Psipred 43 and Disopred 44 , respectively . The predicted secondary structure ( SS ) elements are indicated by greenarrowsfor b - strands , redcylindersfor a - helices , andablacklineforcoils ; the associated confidence ( conf ) score is displayed below , ranging from 0 to 9 for poor and high confidence , respectively . Amino acid conservation is indicatedbya0to10score , andhighlightedbybrowntoyellowhistogrambars . The confidence in predicting disorder is also scored from 0 to 10 , by multiplying tenfold the Disopred probability . Arpin is predicted to be a structured protein with the notable exception of the 20 C - terminal residues , which are predicted to be disordered with high confidence . LETTER RESEARCH Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©201 3 Extended Data Figure 2 | NMR analysisof 15 N - labelled humanArpin . Both views represent 1 H – 15 N heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( HSQC ) spectra . Each peak corresponds to the 1 H – 15 N backbone amide bond of a specificresidue . The positionof a 1 H – 15 N peak in the spectrum depends on the chemical environment of the corresponding residue . a , Such a scattered distribution of peaks is characteristic of a folded protein . The last 20 residues were assigned to individual peaks and are displayed on the spectrum . These residues are clustered in the centre of the spectrum . b , Same HSQC spectrum displayed with a higher threshold to display only high peaks . The height of a peak depends on the mobility of the residue on a picosecond to millisecond timescale . This spectrum experimentally demonstrates that the 20 C - terminal residues are highly mobile . This result confirms that , as predicted , the Arp2 / 3 - binding site of Arpin is exposed as a poorly structured tail of the protein . RESEARCH LETTER Macmillan Publishers Limited .

The height of ultraviolet peaks was normalized to 1 to be displayed on the same figure . A single peak was detected in all cases . The measured masses indicate that no complex is formed between Arpin and Rac and that the single peak observed in the mixture corresponds to cofractionation of the two proteins of similar mass by SEC .

Arpin staining is lost after short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated depletion . Intensity profiles along multiple line scans encompassing the cell periphery were registered to the outer edge of the staining of a lamellipodial marker . This marker was Arpin in a and cortactin in b . The multiple line scans were then averaged and displayed as an intensity plot , where the y axis represents fluorescent intensity , arbitrary units ( mean 6 s . e . m . , n 5 17 , 16 and 17 , respectively ) . Scale bar , 20 m m . Arp2 / 3 localization extends rearwards relative to Arpin localization . This result is because the Arp2 / 3 complex becomes a branchedjunctionwhenactivatedbytheWAVEcomplexatthelamellipodium tip . The branched junction undergoes retrograde flow like actin itself due to actin filament elongation 9 , 12 . Cortactin recognizes Arp2 / 3 at the branch junction and is thought to stabilize branched actin networks 13 . As a marker of the branched junction , cortactin stains the width of lamellipodia , like the Arp2 / 3 complex . c , Rac1 knockout MEFs that lack lamellipodia 14 are completely devoid of Arpin staining at the cell periphery , in line with the complete absence of lamellipodia indicated here by the absence of cortactin staining .

The last two experiments indicate that Arpin exerts its effect on cell spreading through its ability to regulate the Arp2 / 3 complex . LETTER RESEARCH Macmillan Publishers Limited .

During fish gastrulation , prechordal plate cells migrate collectively in a straight direction from the margin of the embryo towards the animal pole 38 , 46 . Loss of arpin function induces dispersion as evidenced by increased lateral cell displacement ( n 5 1 , 516 and 1 , 546 ) and a higher distance between cells ( n 5 194 and 235 ) . Lateral displacement is the cell movement perpendicular to main direction of the migration .

The mean square displacement gives a measure of the area explored by cells for any given time interval . By setting a positional vector on the cellular trajectory at time t , the MSD is defined as : MSD ( D t ) ~ ½ x ( t z t 0 ) { x ( t 0 ) (cid:2) 2 z ½ y ( t z t 0 ) { y ( t 0 ) (cid:2) 2 (cid:2) (cid:3) t , N , in which brackets hi indicate averages over all starting times t 0 and all cells N .

All rights reserved ©201 3 Extended Data Figure 10 | Analysis of direction autocorrelation of the different migration experiments . a , Principle of the analysis . A hypothetical cell trajectory is depicted . Each step is represented by a vector of normalizedlength . h istheanglebetweencomparedvectors . Theplotillustrates the cos h values for the putative trajectory of four steps ( colour - coded ) . Averaging these cos h values yields the direction autocorrelation ( DA ) function of time that measures the extent to which these vectors are aligned over different time intevals . The DA function is defined as : DA ( t ) ~ v u ( t 0 ) N u ( t 0 z t ) w t 0 , N ~ v cos h ( t 0 , t 0 z t ) w to , N , in which u ( t 0 ) is the vector at the starting time t 0 , and u ( t 0 1 t ) the vector at t 0 1 t . Brackets indicate that all calculated cosines are averaged for all possible starting times ( t 0 ) over all cells ( N ) . For each time interval t , vectors from all cell trajectories were used to compute average and sem .
