U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 1 2 4 Context - oriented communication and the design 5 of computer supported discursive learning 6 Thomas Herrmann & Andrea Kienle 7 Received : 24 May 2007 / Accepted : 12 May 2008 8 # International Society of the Learning Sciences , Inc . ; Springer Science + Business Media , LLC 2008 11 Abstract Computer supported discursive learning ( CSDL ) systems for the support of 12 asynchronous discursive learning need to fulfil specific socio - technical conditions . To 13 understand these conditions , we employed design experiments combining aspects of 14 communication theory , empirical findings , and continuous improvement of the investigated 15 prototypes is employed . Our theoretical perspective starts with a context - oriented model of 16 communication which is — as a result of the experiments — extended by including the role of 17 a third - party such as a facilitator . The theory - driven initial design requirements lead to the 18 CSCL - prototype , KOLUMBUS , emphasizing the role of annotations . In KOLUMBUS , 19 annotations can be immediately embedded in their context of learning material . Practical 20 experience with the prototype in five cases reveals possibilities for implementing 21 improvements and observing their impact . On this basis , we provide guidelines for the 22 design of CSDL systems which focus on the support of asynchronous discursive learning . 23 Keywords Communication . Facilitation . Design of CSCL - systems . Evaluation 25 Introduction 26 A wide range of collaborative learning is based on and mediated by the communication 27 amongst students and between them and their teachers . We call those settings where the 28 communicative exchange of beliefs and arguments has the deciding role for the success of 29 collaborative learning discursive learning and the phenomenon that computer - based 30 environments help to enhance it computer supported discursive lear ning ( CSDL ) . We 31 consider discourses to be a kind of talk that can also be represented by text and that has Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning DOI 10 . 1007 / s11412 - 008 - 9045 - 5 T .

This view of discourse is supported by ‘ exploratory talk ’ ( Mercer and Wegerif 34 1999 ) . Discourses can be triggered by misunderstandings and breakdowns ( Stahl 2000 ) or 35 by opportunities and problems ( Herrmann 2003 ) — all of them promote the reinterpretation 36 and articulation of the concepts and beliefs underlying the discourse . 37 We intend to present an in - depth analysis of those aspects of computer - mediated 38 communication that mainly support deliberate reflection in discourses . This intention is 39 based on a constructivist approach that is often used as “ a motivating theory in CSCL 40 literature ” ( Suthers 2006 ) . Constructivist learning can be supported by processes where 41 students work together on a problem which they can only solve if they develop and acquire 42 knowledge which is new for them . We suppose that discourse can have — depending on the 43 problem to be solved — a positive impact on the intensity of knowledge construction . The 44 more the solution of the problem cannot be directly checked against the constraints of 45 the real world , the more is its appropriateness a matter of deliberate discussion . This in 46 particular is the case with problems where more than one answer is appropriate . 47 Working on this kind of task intertwines certain types of activities as shown in Fig . 1 1 . It 48 displays on the one hand the switching between individual work ( on prepared or newly 49 found material , such as text , pictures and other types of media ) and communication , and on 50 the other hand the switching between mere information exchange ( notes , comments ) and 51 focused discussion threads about certain topics . These switches characterize the challenges 52 to be met by CSDL since they imply phases where it is more or less relevant that the 53 students make themselves understandable to each other . 54 Appropriate design of CSDL therefore has to meet the particular requirements of 55 enabling mutual understanding . For this reason we suggest trying out a design approach 56 that is guided by communication theory . We are interested in synthesizing those aspects of 57 communication theory which help to explain how mutual understanding — and subsequently 58 the convergence of ideas and beliefs — is possible . It becomes obvious that the appropriate 59 interrelation between communicative utterances and their context make a decisive 60 contribution to the success of mutual understanding , and that — however — this relevance 1 The modelling notation which is used in Fig . 1 and in the other diagrams in this paper is explained in ( Herrmann 2006 ) . The white semi - circles in Fig . 1 indicate that an activity may include more sub - activities than are depicted in the diagram . Fig . 1 Process map of discursive learning T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 61 of communicative context is usually neglected in CSCL research ( for exceptions see Stahl 62 2002 ; Enyedi and Hoadley 2006 ) . 63 Many other CSCL concepts and experiments are focused on helping students to improve 64 their communication for the purpose of constructive learning . The most prominent 65 approaches are those which attempt to achieve improvement by contributing to the 66 structuring of communication . Typical examples are the application of categories of speech 67 act and argumentation theory ( Ludvigsen and Morch 2003 ) or the guidance of the students 68 through predefined communication threads that are represented by scripts ( Kobbe et al . 69 2007 ) . However , the scripting approaches are not sufficiently oriented to the problem , 70 which is that the students need to learn and to gain practice in how they can produce 71 computer - mediated statements that can be easily understood by others . The uploading of 72 statements with a computer makes it difficult for students to anticipate how hard it may be 73 for others to understand and share the idea that is underlying these statements . Therefore , 74 our approach aims to support communicative behavior that takes knowledge about the 75 communication partners and their perceptible context into account . 76 The following section starts with the theoretical derivation of a model of communication 77 that puts the relevance of context into its foreground and reveals the relevant activities to be 78 technically supported . The third section describes the practical settings of courses for which 79 the prototypes were designed and where they were tested . The next section represents 80 the theory - related features of the prototype and their experience - driven improvement . The 81 structure of this section starts with theory - based design , and is followed by the 82 demonstration of its usefulness and also some shortcomings ; they are the basis for 83 proposing the new design of technical features , which are illustrated by examples . 84 Subsequently , the essential findings with respect to technical design and theory are 85 discussed and related to the literature in the fifth section , which is followed by concluding 86 remarks . 87 A context - oriented model of communication 88 This section outlines the theoretical approach which guided the design experiments . It starts 89 with an overview of relevant communication theories and points out the difference between 90 technical and human – human communication . It is argued that with respect to most 91 communication theories , human communication partners are only loosely coupled and that 92 therefore the context of communication plays an important role in supporting their coupling 93 during their efforts to achieve mutual understanding . Consequently , the “ The context of a 94 communication ” section describes and differentiates the phenomenon of “ communicative 95 context ” and represents the details with the help of a graphical diagram which can serve as 96 guidance for design . The next step ( the “ Activities of communication ” section ) describes 97 the activities during communication to provide a basis for the design of the technical 98 functionality needed to support communication . In particular , the requirements which have 99 to be met by the participants in the case of computer - mediated communication are 100 described . Finally it is outlined how the context - oriented communication theory differs 101 from those approaches which are widely applied in CSCL research and design . 102 The wealth of theories on communication ( for an overview , see e . g . , McCarthy and 103 Monk 1994 or Littlejohn 1999 ) demonstrate that we can draw on a multiplicity of scientific 104 approaches when explaining human communication . McCarthy and Monk ( 1994 ) point out 105 that conversation analysis ( … ) , speech act theory , and common - ground oriented 106 psychological theory have mainly influenced the field of CSCW . These approaches Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 107 recognize — or at least imply — that acts of human communication cannot be explained with 108 a model of encoding an item of information , conveying or transporting it from a sender A to 109 a receiver B through a channel , and subsequently decoding it . The transportation - oriented 110 models refer to Shannon and Weaver ’ s seminal work on communication engineering and 111 are very helpful as a scientific base for data exchange between machines ( Shannon and 112 Weaver 1949 ) . However , these models are based on the concept of a determined coupling 113 between technical systems where the coupling mechanism can be understood by referring to 114 physical relations of cause and effect . Therefore they cannot cover the phenomena of loose 115 coupling between psychological or cognitive systems , as is the case when humans 116 communicate . The engineering - oriented models are also not appropriate if students ’ 117 exchange of messages is mediated by computers . The coupling becomes even looser if it is 118 mediated between non - co - located communication partners and different slots of time , as is 119 typical in asynchronous discursive learning . As an example we can refer to situations where 120 people answer emails by merely reacting to the text of the message but not actually to the 121 person who has written it or to the situation in which the message was generated . 122 The loose coupling between the communication partners can also be understood by 123 referring to the concept of contingency . The German sociologist Luhman builds his theory of 124 social systems on a notion which refers to a social system as a web of communication 125 ( Luhmann 1995 ) . By referring to Maturana and Varela ( 1998 ) , he understands communication 126 as being characterized by double - contingency , which describes that not only the speaker is 127 undetermined in his way of selecting what he / she wants to share with others from his flow of 128 thoughts , but also the listeners , as they follow an utterance and make interpretations which 129 resonate with their own flow of thoughts . Within communication , the concept of contingency 130 means that the listener ’ s interpretation is neither independent from nor determined by the 131 utterance of the speaker . Therefore , it is appropriate to consider communication as a loose 132 coupling . “ The phenomenon of communication depends on not what is transmitted , but 133 on what happened to the person who receives it . And this is a very different matter 134 from »transmitting information . ” ( Maturana and Varela 1998 , p . 196 ) . Instead of being just in 135 the role of a decoder , “ The receiver of a piece of language , be it a word , a sentence , or a text , 136 faces a task of interpretation . A piece of language directs the receiver to build up a conceptual 137 structure , but there is no direct transmission of the meaning the speaker or writer intended . 138 The only building blocks available to the interpreter are his or her own subjective 139 conceptualizations and re - presentations . ” ( von Glasersfeld 1995 , p . 141 ) . The phenomenon 140 of “ loose coupling ” helps to understand why students ’ contributions are sometimes not very 141 closely related to each other even if they try to achieve a convergence of their ideas . 142 Because of the contingency of communication , Ungeheuer ( 1982 ) emphasizes the 143 relevance of context in the course of building shared understanding via communication . The 144 problem of decontextualization and recontextualization in Ackerman and Halverson ( 2004 ) 145 is well known in the domain of knowledge management and is also relevant to explaining 146 the potentials and limits of communicative understanding in CSCL systems when students 147 exchange messages and the results of their work . 148 At first glance one might argue that a communicator ’ s expression should contain as 149 much information as possible about the idea which he wants to share . Thereby a recipient 150 who follows the expression receives extensive guidance to reconstruct what is meant . This 151 expectation runs counter to a basic assumption of communication theory : “ a maximum of 152 explicitness leads to a minimum of understandability ” ( Ungeheuer 1982 , p . 328 , translated 153 by the authors ) . With respect to this assumption , the form and extent of an expression have 154 to be specifically adapted to what the recipients already know and the extent of an 155 expression should be reduced to what is needed by the recipients in order to reconstruct T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 156 what the communicator wants to share with them . Therefore the sharing of information via 157 a computer system has to take into account what the recipients of this information can 158 perceive in the actual moment or may already have perceived on other occasions — 159 consequently their way of having experienced the world has to be considered as context 160 which backs the communication . This is only feasible in CSDL if the participants are able 161 to realize which parts of the available content have been actively received . 162 It is not only the expressions in a communicational dialogue which contribute to the 163 loose coupling between the communicators and their recipients , but also the context which 164 they share . In the case of discursive learning , for example , the material provided by the 165 teacher and investigated by the students can serve as a context and support the coupling 166 between the students and between their communication processes . This effect can be 167 emphasized if a facilitator highlights the most relevant parts of the content . 168 The context of a communication 169 The “ context of an expression ” can be defined by referring to all phenomena in the environment 170 of the communication partners which they can perceive or can have perceived , and which help 171 to reconstruct the thoughts which were referred to by this expression . Context can cover the 172 physical dimension of a situation as well as the social and informational dimension . It should be 173 noticed that the behavior of the communication partners itself is part of the context ( Ducrot and 174 Todorov 1987 ) . Besides the directly perceptible behavior ( perceptible con in Fig . 2 ) , those 175 events which occurred in the past ( perceived con in Fig . 2 ) are also relevant . These past 176 events also cover expressions which were uttered before the current situation . With respect to 177 the relevance of past events , it becomes evident that context can refer to all types of events in 178 everyday life — in as far as the communication partners assume that they share these 179 experiences . The relevance of context can be recognized with respect to the expectations that 180 are developed during the course of the students ’ asynchronous communication and that give 181 them a feeling of how fast the others will probably react to their contributions . If these 182 expectations are not met , they may interpret this as evidence that a misunderstanding has 183 taken place that has to be solved . CSDL has to support the detection of misunderstanding by 184 facilitating the comparison between contributions and the expectations which can be derived 185 from the context . 186 Another example refers to the spectrum of possible reactions to a question such as “ Do 187 we have evidence for this statement from the literature ? ” The question may simply be 188 answered with “ Yes ! ” or this confirmation may be completed with a concrete bibliographic 189 indication , or the question will be interpreted as a request to provide the details that can be 190 extracted from the literature . The appropriate reaction is mostly chosen by referring to the 191 context of such a question . Furthermore , to detect misunderstandings we can use those 192 overarching social activities in which communication is embedded and whose aim is not 193 primarily the development of understanding . We call these activities extra - communicative 194 behavior 2 . For example , if a student receives a message which asks him to submit an 195 outline about his work on a task by a certain deadline , and if he meets this requirement , it 2 By this distinction between communicative and extra - communicative we disagree with Watzlawick et al . ( 1967 ) who take as an axiom that one could not non - communicate . This might be helpful to explain pathological behavior where people cannot differentiate between whether an act of behavior is meant as communication or not . However , it is not helpful for the design of collaborative learning environments in which participants usually have to decide — and are able to do so — whether a contribution is meant as an act of communication ( such as an email message ) or is mainly an interaction with the system which contributes to collaborative task completion ( e . g . , the act of adding an attachment to an email ) . Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 196 can be assumed that he has developed an appropriate understanding of the message with 197 respect to the thought and expectation that were behind this message . 198 The positive effect of context can only be achieved to the extent to which the 199 experiences overlap and are shared by all participants . Clark and Brennan ( 1991 ) refer to 200 this phenomenon of shared context as the “ common ground ” of communication acts . With 201 respect to Fig . 2 “ common ground ” is represented by the intersection of the inner contexts 202 of the communication partners . However , their shared outer context also plays an important 203 role since only by referring to it can common ground be built and be extended . 204 It also has to be taken into consideration to what extent mass media or the World Wide 205 Web , for example , contribute to the development of shared context . When a task description 206 is developed to be dealt with within CSDL , it is questionable whether the students have 207 certain knowledge about what is going on in the world , e . g . , whether they know or not that 208 a new computer virus is currently discussed in the daily press . Therefore links to public 209 material should be an extra type of content item which can be adequately processed with a 210 CSDL system . 211 The communication model in Fig . 2 takes the differentiation between varying types of 212 context into account . It differentiates between the communicator A ( referred to as “ he ” ) and 213 the recipient B ( referred to as “ she ” ) , who tries to share thoughts with A . 214 The communication model shows that results of extra - communicative behaviour ( 1 ) as 215 well as of communicative activities — the expression ( 2 ) — and parts of the environment , e . g . Fig . 2 Differentiation of context T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 217 mass media , ( 3 ) become parts of the context . It also should be noticed that the contexts 218 which are perceptible or could have been perceived by the different participants of a 219 communication ( con of A vs . con of B ) only partially overlap , and only this shared context 220 ( 4 ) ( as represented in Fig . 2 ) can be used to complete the current expression or to ensure the 221 success of understanding . In the case of CSDL this shared context can be built by data 222 which has been uploaded or by the log files of the students ’ communication threads . The 223 system can help to retrieve context by representing uploaded content by links which refer to 224 earlier discussion threads or to material which is somewhere available in the Web . 225 Awareness ( Dourish and Belotti 1992 ) functions can also help to detect relevant parts of 226 context . 227 Furthermore , only a part of the perceptible or previously perceived context in fact leads 228 to impressions or experiences and becomes parts of the inner context of the recipient . Even 229 if the communicator shares context with the recipient he cannot positively conclude that she 230 will relate the same elements of the shared context to the ongoing communication act as he 231 does . This can be typically observed in CSCL chats when the reader references other parts 232 of the chat log than the writer had in mind . Therefore , the depiction of a cutting arc ( cf . 233 Fig . 2 ) , which starts inside the box of an individual ’ s context , indicates that the context is 234 only partially employed to support communication . CSDL should allow the communicator 235 to direct the attention of the potential recipients to those parts of the context which are 236 related to his contribution . 237 Therefore , the differentiation between outer and inner context is helpful . The inner 238 context represents all of those aspects of the available context ( i . e . , the outer context ) which 239 have found their way into the web of experiences — or world of thoughts and feelings — 240 which are represented or available within a person . Designers as well as students have to be 241 aware of this difference between inner and outer context . A typical problem is that not 242 every statement that has been displayed on a screen has really been read and not every 243 statement which has been read has been understood . With respect to CSCL it can be stated 244 that the inner context also includes knowledge which is acquired by ( collaborative ) 245 learning . Figure 2 presents “ knowledge ”— as an important basis of communicative 246 understanding — and the image of the ( communication ) partner as parts of the inner 247 context . “ Knowledge ” can also include information of how the relevant context can be 248 identified and retrieved ( cf . the “ Meta - data of annotations ” section on meta - data ) . The semi - 249 circle at the bottom of the “ inner - context ” box indicates that it can also contain further 250 elements such as feelings or self - image . An important part of students ’ knowledge which 251 supports communication within learning processes is — for example — that the goals of a 252 learning phase are known . The “ image of the partner ” is recognized as relevant in many 253 communication theory based analyses . It is crucial for successful communication that the 254 communicator ’ s “ concept of communication ” ( cf . , Fig . 3 ) takes into account what the 255 recipient may already know . The image of the communication partners must also include an 256 estimation of the outer context which is accessible or has been accessible to the 257 communication partner and their influence on the inner context . 258 We describe this differentiation between outer and inner context because it is particularly 259 relevant to computer - mediated communication . With respect to a CSCL system , for 260 example , its technical features belong to the outer context of the participants ; however , the 261 communicators must understand that not every participant is familiar with all of these 262 features and that they have to take into account whether a certain functionality is known or 263 not . For instance , knowledge about awareness functions or explicit references between chat 264 contributions has an impact on communication processes . Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 265 Activities of communication 266 Communication consists of cognitive activities to which the technical support of discursive 267 learning should be related . Based on his image of the recipient , the communicator develops 268 ( 1 ) — mostly subconsciously — a communication concept which prepares ( 2 ) the uttering of 269 an expression ( the numbers in parentheses refer to Fig . 3 ) . The communicator ’ s concept of 270 how to formulate the expression represents a plan ( Ungeheuer 1982 ) of how the recipient 271 can be guided to reconstruct an idea . With the differentiation between stream of thoughts 272 and idea we want to indicate that something has to be separated from the permanent flow of 273 cognitive activities to become a subject of communication . This differentiation emphasizes 274 that the communication can be continuously influenced by the ongoing stream of thoughts . 275 In situations where the communication partners are not co - present , the distortion by the 276 stream of thoughts is higher than in face - to - face situations and focussing on the needs of the 277 recipient is more difficult . 278 The communicator ’ s “ concept of communication ” has to consider what has to be made 279 explicit by the expression and what can be presumed to be part of the recipient ’ s inner 280 context . Effective communication tries to express only those aspects that are needed to 281 reconstruct the idea . The hint “ click here for further details , ” for example , presupposes that 282 the recipient is aware of the context of Web technology features ; a more explicit phrase 283 such as “ position the cursor over this spot and click to trigger the display of a new webpage 284 which shows further details ” would appear awkward to most users . Being less explicit does 285 not only save time but helps to focus the recipient ’ s attention on those aspects which are 286 really intended to be shared . “ No representation is either complete or permanent . Rather any 287 description is a snapshot of historical processes in which different viewpoints , local 288 contingencies and multiple interests have been temporarily reconciled . ” ( Gerson and Star 289 1986 , p . 257 ) . 290 It is obvious that every idea can lead to a variety of different concepts and expressions in 291 order to communicate it . The relation between the idea to be communicated and the 292 expression can be indirect and incomplete since the main purpose of the expression is to Fig . 3 Activities in the course of communication T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 293 guide the recipient when she tries to imagine what the communicator may have in mind . 294 The phrase “ google it ! ” is a shortcut for referral to a series of activities and can be 295 understood even if being heard for the first time , as long as the recipient is familiar with the 296 context of search engines on the Web . 297 In many cases , the expression includes direct or indirect hints to the context which has to 298 be taken into account by the recipient . In face - to - face communication , participants can be 299 aware of the physical situation , which is perceptible and serves them as context for their 300 communication . They can refer to their environment by gestures . The references to the 301 context have to be made an explicit part of the expression if the relevant context is part of 302 the past or cannot be perceived since the communication is computer - mediated . In CSDL , 303 awareness - features can make the detection of relevant context more feasible . The content 304 which represents the context has to be broken into small units so that it is easier to refer to 305 specific parts of it and to direct the users ` attention to them . 306 The recipient has to follow the expression to achieve a mental representation ( “ image of 307 expression , ” see Fig . 3 ) . This representation is a prerequisite to the development of an idea 308 ( “ making an impression ” ) about what the communicator may have meant . To “ make an 309 impression ” is only possibly if the recipient interprets the expression in relation to her own 310 stream of thoughts and to her inner context ( 5 and 6 , Fig . 3 ) . The interpretation has to be 311 related to the recipient ’ s knowledge of the communicator ( “ image of partner ” , see Fig . 2 ) . 312 “ Making an impression ” leads to a new idea ( 4 , Fig . 3 ) which is — but need not be — 313 correlated to what the communicator has meant . The new idea can — but again need not — 314 partially become a new part of the inner context . With respect to awareness mechanisms , 315 CSDL designers should differentiate between the users ’ merely displaying some content ( of 316 a message , an annotation , etc . ) and those actions ( e . g . , sending a reply , editing a text , etc . ) 317 with which the reader of the content reacts to it . In the latter case it is more probable that the 318 reader has made the content a part of her inner context . This difference should be mirrored 319 by the awareness mechanisms within CSDL . 320 Both — communicator as well as recipient — have to contribute to the identification and 321 avoidance of misunderstandings within the activities “ conceptualizing ” and “ making an 322 impression . ” This aim can be pursued by a permanent comparison of the ongoing dialogue 323 with the context , in particular with the ongoing extra - communicative behavior . This 324 behavior mirrors whether the expectations connected to the communication are fulfilled or 325 not . For example , if the majority of the students of a class are not able to answer a question 326 or to react appropriately to the description of a task , the possibility of a misunderstanding 327 should be checked . The more direct a dialogue is , the more immediately the 328 misunderstanding can possibly become a subject of the ongoing communication . In CSDL , 329 misunderstandings can remain undetected if the recipient fills gaps in information with their 330 own imagination ( i . e . , by referring to their own world of thoughts ) , instead of taking the 331 incompleteness as a reason to ask for further information ( Herrmann 1993 ) . 332 The activities of communication become more difficult to perform in the case of 333 computer - mediated communication . The possible extent of variations of the expressions to 334 be conceptualized is reduced , for example , if the expression can only be represented by 335 text . If the communication is asynchronous , the dialogues are more indirect and the 336 detection and correction of misunderstandings becomes less probable since the feedback is 337 slowed down . Our communication model emphasizes the relevance of context if one 338 attempts to understand the advantages and disadvantages of a medium . Text , for example , 339 reduces the variety of possible expression but is easier to search when the reconstruction of 340 context takes place . We suggest that the complexity of the activity “ conceptualizing an 341 expression ” is increased in those cases where the variability of selectable expressions is Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 342 reduced , the role reversal between communicator and recipient becomes slower and more 343 indirect , or the extent of perceptible shared context is decreased . In these cases , the 344 communicator should be supported to increase the redundancy of his communicative 345 expressions and to offer more than a single clue ( e . g . , by the combination of text and 346 pictures , cf . , the so - called paper view as described in the “ Integration of material and 347 communicative contributions ” section ) which help the recipient to reconstruct the idea . 348 Larger parts of the communicator ’ s context have to be made explicit or at least be explicitly 349 referred to , since it is difficult for the communicator to anticipate which parts of his context 350 will be shared by the recipient or not . His anticipation of the recipient ’ s available context 351 has to take into account the possibility of temporal delay as well as differences with respect 352 to locations , cultural habits , physical situations , availability of mass media , etc . For 353 example , it is a typical phenomenon in the context of knowledge management and 354 collaborative learning that the participants find it difficult to formulate questions about 355 complex issues when these questions are submitted to other , unknown users ( Kienle and 356 Herrmann 2004 , p . 47 ) . For the recipient , the understanding of computer - mediated 357 expressions becomes easier the more possibilities she has to identify and add additional 358 context to her process of transforming the expression into an impression . She has to become 359 active to reconstruct context or to find further context that is necessary to complete an 360 expression . 361 Functionality which provides awareness is particularly helpful for both communication 362 partners for creating context clues since awareness can be related to what we have described 363 as extra - communicative behavior . Awareness makes those interactions with the system 364 which are not per se meant as communicative acts visible , such as the up - or down - loading 365 of data , editing of material , etc . Awareness data gives additional information to the 366 communicators and their addressees about the overarching effects of their communication . 367 In general , it should be considered in CSDL design that the usage of the system leaves 368 traces which help to assure the success of communicative understanding . Both — 369 communicator as well as recipient — have to be aware of the ongoing extra - communicative 370 behavior to check on the success of the achieved understanding . 371 Context - oriented communication theory in comparison to other concepts 372 Highly relevant in CSCL research are concepts which refer to speech act theory and 373 conversation analysis to support the structuring of collaborative learning processes . Speech 374 acts are used to categorize the activities or steps in the process of collaboration . Once they 375 are categorized , rules can be specified to determine which category should follow another 376 one , such as an answer should follow on a question or a contra - argument after a pro - 377 argument . Conversation analysis can help to find appropriate sequences . However , the 378 decision to which category an expression can be assigned and how the conversation is 379 appropriately continued after this expression is extremely dependent on the context . Above , 380 we demonstrated with the expression : “ Do we have evidence for this statement from the 381 literature ? ” that it can be considered as a simple question or a request . There are numerous 382 examples in the literature ( e . g . McCarthy and Monk 1994 , p . 53 ) which clarify that 383 determination of categories and sequences cannot be context - free . 384 CSCL also refers to Clark and Brennan ’ s concept of common ground to explain under 385 what conditions understanding is possible and why misunderstandings can happen . The 386 notion of common ground can lead to the misconception that it consists of a set of identical 387 beliefs and experiences which are shared by the communication partners . By contrast , 388 context - oriented communication theory only claims that there are experiences on both sides T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 389 which refer to the same perceptible outer context , which only implies that these experiences 390 are partially congruent so that misunderstandings can be detected . The difficult questions 391 with respect to common ground are how it is built and expanded , and how do the 392 communicating partners know whether they share common ground to a sufficient extent . 393 We suggest that referring to the interrelationship between inner and outer context can help 394 to deal with these questions . 395 The problems with computer mediated communication are widely discussed in theories on 396 the selection of the appropriate type of media . Media richness theory ( Daft and Lengel 1986 ) 397 evaluates the appropriateness of a medium with respect to a task by considering the spectrum 398 of possible representations of information such as text , audio , video , etc . Media feature theory 399 ( El - Shinnawy and Markus 1997 ) refers to the functions which are offered to handle the 400 mediated information . Media synchronicity theory ( Dennis and Valacich 1999 ) differentiates 401 between phases of divergent and convergent communication . Roughly described , this theory 402 relates asynchronous media to the phase of divergence and synchronous media to 403 convergence . We assign the exchange of arguments , the negotiation of positions and the 404 making of decisions to the phase of convergence ( Stahl and Herrmann 1999 ) . We found some 405 evidence in our explorative practical usage of CSCL systems that students prefer synchronous 406 media — such as chat — for more intensive discussion . However , we assume that more 407 deliberate exchange and negotiation of differing beliefs is — in the context of learning — better 408 supported by asynchronous media . This assumption is backed by studies ( e . g . Armitt et al . 409 2002 , p . 157 ) that found that asynchronous discourses stimulate reflection more than 410 synchronous communication . Therefore we focus our theory - driven design experiment on 411 asynchronous support of discursive learning . Since media - oriented theories neglect the 412 interrelation between communication and context , we refer to more basic communication 413 theories to derive functionalities that support students in intensifying their mutual 414 understanding in the course of communication . 415 Methodological and practical background of the empirical exploration 416 From a methodological point of view , this paper describes a theory - driven design 417 experiment . “ Theory - driven ” means that we intend to check out certain features and 418 characteristics which are derived from communication theory , and have therefore built 419 CSDL prototypes ( KOLUMBUS 1 and 2 ) to add these features to the typical functionality 420 which is usually found in CSCL systems for teams of students who work on mutual , 421 discussion - oriented tasks of knowledge construction . Typical examples of those kinds of 422 systems , which we adopted as role models , are Webguide ( Stahl and Herrmann 1999 ) and 423 CSILE ( Scardamalia et al . 1994 ) . We found that communication theory approaches are 424 relatively neglected in the CSCL community in contrast to psychological theories or 425 learning theories , and that the difference between working on content and human – human 426 communication is not well represented in models of online learning ( as is exemplified in 427 Figure 2 . 5 in Anderson 2004 ) . We are aware of the general limits of a theory - driven 428 approach ( Wilson 1999 ) and that it may narrow our view on the necessities of an 429 appropriate design . Therefore we planned to check our prototypes against the requirements 430 of real , practical usage in classes and to be ready to modify the theory if necessary . 431 The bridge between theory and design is built by models — in our case graphical diagrams 432 as shown in Figs . 2 and 3 . These models detail the activities and relevant entities that 433 characterize communicative endeavours to achieve mutual understanding . The graphical 434 models display the requirements that guide the technical design and can conversely be Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 435 influenced by the technology and its usage if it becomes apparent that the theoretical model 436 has to be altered since it does not mirror the reality of human behaviour . 437 The prototypes were not tested in laboratory experiments but practically applied in 438 classrooms . Thus we have conducted a design experiment ( see , e . g . , Brown 1992 ) . The 439 experimental design can be characterized by the features summarized by Barab and Squire 440 ( 2004 ) . Consequently , our study is oriented toward qualitative data , observing the 441 interdependency of a set of variables instead of only a single parameter , and toward 442 singular temporal events which cannot be repeated . We involved a variety of participants in 443 the design including the perspective of several students and we flexibly reflected on our 444 design decisions and ran through several cycles of improvement which were inspired by the 445 practical experience . The subjects of our design were the socio - technical settings which 446 covered the technical support , the organizational procedure , and the prepared content of 447 courses . We see it as an advantage that the theory - driven design experiment refers to real 448 settings since it increases the chances that those influencing variables which are neglected 449 by the underlying theory become apparent . On the other hand we have to accept the 450 limitation that this kind of experiment makes it impossible to control the influence of single 451 parameters and therefore can only lead to results at an exploratory level . However , we 452 found substantial evidence at this level of how students can be technically supported during 453 discursive learning to overcome the difficulties with computer - mediated communication . 454 We describe technical features with which they can increase mutual understanding by 455 relating their communicative statements to the relevant context as it is built by material or 456 by the contributions of others . We “… draw connections to theoretical assertions and claims 457 that transcend the local context …” ( Barab and Squire 2004 , p . 8 ) of our settings by 458 emphasizing the role of a third party in communication models , which has a meta - function 459 with respect to the increase in understandability . 460 In order to gather experience with KOLUMBUS and the interplay of material ( as 461 context ) and annotations ( as communicative acts ) , KOLUMBUS was used in different 462 settings . Experiences in a first round of evaluation were a basis for further improvements 463 that were again used in different settings . In an initial round , two case studies were 464 conducted with the aim of detecting potential for improvement : 465 1 . Seminar in computer science : The first study used a course which is a mandatory 466 seminar of the computer science program at the University of Dortmund . The topic of 467 the seminar was the impact of using information and communication technology on 468 working and daily life . The organizers of the seminar used KOLUMBUS to distribute 469 documents and organizational information ( e . g . , meeting information , etc . ) . The 16 470 participating students used KOLUMBUS during their work in subgroups to develop , 471 review and discuss their own material . 472 2 . Discussions in groups of researchers : The second case was arranged as a case study 473 where four groups of scientists and students ( with four members each ) used discussion 474 and negotiation support to decide which topics they would like to discuss at a 2 - day 475 group meeting ( referred to as “ negotiation case study ” ) . 476 Experiences with the redesign of annotations are mainly based on three different settings 477 that were organised as blended - learning scenarios . In more detail the courses are : 478 1 . Student project group in e - business : The project group of 11 students and one tutor took 479 place at the University of Applied Sciences in Fulda ( Germany ) . The task was 480 requirements analysis , design and implementation of a web - based e - business application . 481 The group met regularly each week in a face - to - face meeting . KOLUMBUS 2 , more T . Herrmann , A .

Student project group in computer science : This project group of 12 students and two 486 tutors took place at the University of Dortmund ( Germany ) . This 1 - year project was a 487 software engineering project that included all steps from requirements definition to 488 software testing and documenting . KOLUMBUS 2 was mainly used to collect and 489 discuss requirements for the system ( at the beginning of the project ) and to discuss and 490 write the documentation of the group work ( at the end of the project ) . 491 3 . Seminar in pedagogy : The seminar took place at the University of Dortmund 492 ( Germany ) , Education Institute . Fourteen students were arranged into four subgroups 493 of three or four students . The topic of the seminar was the concept of and experiences 494 with e - learning on a non - detailed level given by the tutor and with space provided for 495 student research questions and solution ideas in the four groups . KOLUMBUS 2 was 496 used by the subgroups for the discussion and development of a talk and final 497 documentation of their research . 498 For the collection and analysis of data , a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods was 499 used in all settings . The quantitative part was based on log files : the different events in 500 KOLUMBUS 2 were recorded ( e . g . , add or download material or annotations ) . The evaluation 501 of the log files was partly conducted using a prototyped KOLUMBUS module ( Kienle and 502 Ritterskamp 2007 ) that supports the analysis of logged events in the KOLUMBUS content 503 area . On the one hand , the qualitative part of the study is based on regular verbal group 504 interviews with the students and the tutors . All interviews were recorded , typed and analysed 505 in order to add reasons to the quantitative findings and evaluate the concepts of KOLUMBUS 506 2 . On the other hand , all annotations of the created content structures of the mentioned 507 courses were analysed with respect to the types of annotations . 508 Design usage and cyclic improvement of a CSDL system 509 The insights into context - oriented communication theory as well as the system usage in 510 seminar settings were the basis for the construction of the requirements in the design of a 511 prototype CSDL system . Its main characteristic is to offer functionality which combines 512 communication as well as context support . In the following we concentrate in those 513 functionalities which support context - oriented communication . For details regarding other 514 functionalities see Kienle ( 2006 ) . 515 Integration of material and communicative contributions 516 To meet the requirements derived from the context - oriented model of communication , we 517 built the CSDL system KOLUMBUS . The crucial feature of KOLUMBUS is to support the 518 segmentation of content into small units . This allows the learners a highly flexible 519 intertwining of content as context with acts of communication in the form of annotations . 520 An advantage of the concept of the fine - grained item - structure is that communicative 521 contributions can be directly linked to that part of the content to which they refer and 522 therefore provide the relevant context . Because participants share the content in 523 KOLUMBUS , it provides a basis for shared context as defined in the “ Activities of 524 communication ” section . Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 525 The design of communicative contributions in the form of annotations is inspired by 526 systems for the joint creation and editing of text like CoNote ( Davis and Huttenlocher 527 1995 ) , CaMILE ( Guzdial and Turns 2000 ) , and WebAnn ( Bernheim Brush et al . 2002 ) . All 528 these systems focus on functionalities enabling annotations , but do not support the linkage 529 of fine - grained material ( CoNote and CaMILE ) or material that is added by the learners 530 ( WebAnn ) . Therefore the material cannot be used flexibly as context like in KOLUMBUS . 531 Similar ideas that include the adaptation of annotations for collaborative learning are also 532 reported in other current studies ( see , e . g . , anchored discussions ; van der Pol et al . 2006 ) . 533 KOLUMBUS 3 provides two different views of content . In the tree view , each item is 534 represented as a node in a hierarchical tree - structure ( for details see Kienle 2006 , see 535 Fig . 4 ) . To focus on relevant content , parts of the tree or the whole tree can be expanded or 536 minimized . Each user decides which content is relevant for him and which parts he wants to 537 perceive . Furthermore , newly inserted items are indicated as new . The menu can be 538 activated at every single item ( see Fig . 4 ) . It allows users to add communicative 539 contributions ( in form of annotations ) or material . While the structure of a set of 540 interrelated annotations represents a dialogue - oriented discussion thread , the hierarchical 541 structure of the material depends on the logical relationships within its content . 542 The tree view offers an overview of the items and helps the user to view possible content 543 at a glance and therefore to identify those parts of the available context which are new and 544 also relevant to him or her . By contrast to the tree view , the paper view shows content in a 545 visually more attractive and readable way . Here , different types of presentations are 546 combined to form a single document . Within the paper view , KOLUMBUS supports the 547 perception of meaningful structures built up on a didactical basis . It helps the user to 548 perceive the directly surrounding context of an annotation and allows him or her to perceive 549 details of the context . All functions of KOLUMBUS are available in both types of 550 representation ( paper or tree view ) , e . g . , to add communicative contributions ( in form of 551 annotations ) and material ( all other item types ) . 552 An advantage of the concept of fine - grained item - structure is that communicative 553 contributions can be directly linked to that part of the content to which they refer , which 554 therefore provides the relevant context . From this point of view , it becomes obvious that the 3 KOLUMBUS has gone through several cycles of improvement — further information can be found under http : / / www . imtm - iaw . rub . de / projekte / k2 / index . html . Fig . 4 Integrated tree view with magnified context menu and awareness tool ( blue , green , red bar ) T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 555 definition of context depends on the communication act itself ; context is everything to 556 which an annotation refers . Other studies have confirmed that a link between learning 557 material and communication “ increases the communicative efficiency ” because the 558 integrated communication support allows communication that is “ more straight forward 559 and to the point ” ( van der Pol et al . 2006 ) . 560 Figure 5 shows the paper view of an authentic part of the content structure of the 561 seminar in computer science ; a title and some sections of material and two annotations 562 ( communicative contributions ) . Annotations are marked with an “ A ” and with the name of 563 the author in front . Because the communicative contributions are placed in direct context , 564 the author does not need to include hints for further context . This leads to relatively short 565 contributions and the usage of direct references ( in both annotations in Fig . 5 the word 566 “ hier ” ( German for “ here ” ) are used to reference the context ) . 567 Discursive learning is supported by the possibility of discussion threads that can be 568 developed by annotating other participant ’ s annotations . These threads can be handled in 569 the same manner as in newsgroups ; threads can occur in parallel and they can be expanded 570 or minimized ( as all items in KOLUMBUS ) ; Fig . 6 shows an example of discussions in the 571 researcher groups . Items are signed with the pencil and post - it icon . Since the tree view 572 should only give an overview , only the beginning of the annotations ( as well as text - based 573 material ) is presented in one row . The whole content can be read in a tool tip that appears 574 with the mouse - over . The integration of material and discussions are also required in other 575 publications . Hmelo - Silver , for example , mentions this requirement with respect to 576 computer - supported problem - based learning : “ There needs to be a mechanism for the 577 facilitator and other students to negotiate and discuss the contents of the whiteboards in an 578 integrated fashion ” Q2 ( Hmelo - Silver 2002 , p . 207 ) . 579 Taking into account the experience within the design experiment , it became apparent that 580 annotations in KOLUMBUS were an appropriate vehicle for contextual communication and 581 discursive learning . Students tried to transfer their experience and habits with the functions 582 of text - based communication media — such as email — to the annotations . 583 Annotations were predominately used in the review - phase of the seminar where students 584 were asked to comment on each other ’ s material . By inserting comments as annotations in 585 the appropriate position in the content , not many additional explications were necessary . References to the context ( ”Hier“ means ”here“ ) Fig . 5 Communicative contributions in context Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 586 Therefore , the overall process of adding communicative contributions was noticeably easier 587 than in situations without direct relations to context ( e . g . , email or newsgroups ) . During the 588 negotiation case study , annotations were used to support the discussion process by 589 exchanging arguments for or against proposed topics . 590 Presentation and handling of annotations 591 This subsection deals in more detail with the presentation and handling of annotations . The 592 initial design of KOLUMBUS offers the users the possibility to easily differentiate between 593 annotations and material : the tree view uses different icons , while the paper view employs 594 different colours . The differentiation between annotations and material helps the user to 595 distinguish which content is meant as communicative contributions by others and which 596 not . With respect to the communication model , this means a differentiation between the 597 expression of a communication and its context . The context of an annotation is not only 598 represented by material ; other already existing annotations can also take on the role of 599 context ( being built by preceding communication ) which helps one to understand an 600 annotation which is under consideration at a certain moment . In the paper view , the 601 communicative character of annotations is increased by prefixing the annotation with the 602 author ’ s name , similar to the convention with newsgroups . 603 Organizational and content - related annotations 604 The usage of the initial design reveals some need for improvement regarding the types of 605 annotations . Students mentioned that they recognize two different purposes of communi - 606 cative contributions which should be easily distinguishable . The first kind are organiza - 607 tional annotations that have a coordinative character ( e . g . , “ please insert here more 608 information about …” ) , the second kind are content - related annotations that bring the 609 discussion and the common artefacts as a result of collaborative learning respectively one 610 step further . From the theoretical point of view , these types are related to context 611 information concerning the intention of the contribution writing and the relevance of the 612 contribution for the overarching cooperation process ( organizational ) or the discussion of 613 contents ( content - related ) . This differentiation is realized in KOLUMBUS ; when adding a 614 new annotation , it has the property “ content - related ” by default , but can be labelled as 615 “ organizational ” by the author . The different labels correspond to different colours in all Contributions in parallel Discussion thread Fig . 6 Discussions by using annotations T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 616 views , which help the reader to differentiate the annotations at a first glance . Figure 7 617 shows the differentiation between organizational and content - related annotations . 618 A content analysis of the annotations ( see Kienle 2007a for details ) in the different 619 settings revealed that a high percentage of all annotations were incorrectly categorized . This 620 means that they are marked as content - related although they include only organizational 621 issues . Some annotations marked as content - related include both organizational and 622 content - related issues . 623 From these findings we conclude that participants wrote many annotations without 624 reflecting and explicating their type respectively . This results in a high number of incorrect 625 content - related annotations because the default is “ content - related ” as whenever an 626 annotation is written it is content - related except in those cases where the author explicitly 627 chooses ‘ organizational ’ . This default is also the reason why no annotation was found that 628 had been typed incorrectly as organizational . 629 Although the interviewed users expressed a wish to be able to label the annotations 630 differently ( as content or as organisational ) , this differentiation was not used properly after 631 the possibility had been introduced into the system . Even in studies with mandatory 632 selection of a category it was found that members of a group need a long time when they 633 try to develop a common understanding of the meaning of certain categories ( Ludvigsen 634 and Morch 2003 ) . 635 On the other hand , the findings showed that both types are relevant for collaborative 636 learning . This is especially true in long - period scenarios that do not include weekly face - to - 637 face meetings because all organizational issues are discussed with the help of the CSDL 638 system and this requires organizational contributions . The studies showed that in short - 639 period scenarios the organizational effort is not that high and in settings with weekly face - 640 to - face meetings a lot of organizational issues were discussed in the meetings . 641 With respect to the context - oriented model of communication we can state that the 642 authors of an annotation do not use the appropriate type for the annotation as additional 643 context information . Therefore the recipients have the major burden of reconstructing the 644 real aim of the annotation . It becomes apparent that the need for structuring communicative 645 contributions in asynchronous communication has first to be learnt by the communicators . 646 It may also be the case that the students have not understood that the categorizing of their Keyword Name and Date O r g a n i z a t i o n a l C o n t e n t - r e l a t e d Fig . 7 Presentation of annotations ( paper view ) names are hidden due to privacy reasons Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 647 statements has a communicative relevance and is not just some additional task being 648 imposed on them by the teacher . 649 Meta - data of annotations 650 A second improvement deals with the presentation of meta - data such as keyword , author , and 651 date in front of annotations in tree and paper view . This helps — in terms of the context - 652 oriented communication theory — to identify the context in which the annotation has been 653 conceptualized . In KOLUMBUS , a keyword for the annotation can be added in a similar way 654 to the specification of a subject - field of an email . This keyword summarizes the annotation 655 and helps the reader to recognize the content of the annotation at a glance . The keyword as 656 well as the author and the date are prefixed to the annotation itself . Figure 8 also shows the 657 presentation of meta - data . 658 Regarding the usage of keywords , more annotations with keywords than without were 659 added in the experimental fields . An interesting fact could be found while analyzing the 660 relation between keyword usage and the discussion process . We determined for each 661 annotation the time span which passed before a follow - up annotation ( of other authors ) was 662 written . This time span varies from less than 1 min to 4 days . The average of time span 663 between annotations with keywords and their previous annotation is approximately twice as 664 high as for annotations without keywords and their previous annotation . 665 We conclude that the authors assume that the context of their own annotation is clearer 666 when annotations are made shortly after one another with little time in between and that 667 they consequently do not summarize their annotation with a keyword . This is additionally 668 supported by the fact that annotations made with little time between them are often related Fig . 8 Annotation window as an overview of new contributions names are hidden for privacy reasons T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 669 to the same discussion thread , which can also be interpreted as context . On the other hand , 670 if a longer period of time passes before a new annotation is written , the context has often 671 switched and the author explicates more information by adding a keyword . An 672 automatically generated “ reply - to ” entry in the keyword field ( like for example in 673 discussion forums or email applications ) could support the user in explicating the context . 674 Overview of annotations 675 The detection of annotations in both integrated views was described as difficult . This 676 problem is already known from the evaluation of newsgroups . Due to the integration of 677 material and communicative contributions , this problem was further exacerbated . Many 678 interviewees considered a generally improved way of announcing new contributions 679 ( annotations ) to be necessary . In the initial case studies , new communicative contributions 680 were added at nearly every position in the content structure and this is what was 681 considered to be a problem . This flexibility makes it more difficult to detect the relevant 682 context than would be the case if they were all collected in a special content area . Group 683 discussions revealed that a sensible solution might be an option to display all annotations 684 in chronological order . This solution has two advantages . On the one hand , the access to 685 new annotations and the awareness of them are eased . In terms of the context - oriented 686 model of communication , the annotation window supports the activity “ following the 687 expression ” ( see Fig . 3 of the context - oriented communication model ) . On the other hand , 688 the understanding of an annotation is supported because it can be easily related to past 689 contributions and ( different ) discussion threads — both are also kinds of context 690 information . 691 The KOLUMBUS annotation window is shown in Fig . 8 . It is comparable to an email 692 inbox that gives an overview of all annotations in the chosen content area . The entries in the 693 list are links which guide the user to the position of the annotations in the integrated view . 694 The list can be sorted by different meta - data ( e . g . , author , date , subject ) and filtered ( e . g . , 695 only content - related annotations ) . This window helps to perceive the annotations in 696 chronological order and to be aware of new annotations . 697 Experiences with the annotation window revealed that its usage depends on the 698 underlying scenario and the level of interweaving between communicative contributions in 699 the form of annotations and context in the form of other material . In the analyzed settings 700 we can differentiate between two levels : 701 & Low interweaving between communicative contributions and material as context 702 information : in this case KOLUMBUS 2 is used more as a discussion forum than 703 as an integrated platform . Discussion threads are not integrated with other forms of 704 material ( text , figures , etc . ) . For the participants , the detection of new annotations 705 is possible without the annotation window because the tree view itself does not 706 grow as fast as in settings with rapidly expanding material , and gives a good 707 overview of the discussion threads . 708 & High interweaving between communicative contributions and material as context 709 information : in this case KOLUMBUS 2 is used as a platform for an integrated 710 development of material and discussions . The content structure grows very quickly 711 because of many new items of different types ( e . g . , text or figures as material and 712 annotations as communicative contributions ) and the detection of new annotations 713 is quite difficult . Here the annotation window serves as a kind of awareness feature 714 to find those annotations that were placed “ somewhere ” in the integrated view .

It became 719 apparent during the interviews that the whole process of collaborative learning and 720 development of shared understanding needs explicit coordination and facilitation . One 721 problem was that almost everyone hesitates to summarize the current state of the 722 discussion . There was a strong request in the group interviews that one person should 723 control the discussion ( and the negotiation ) process . Participants tried to help themselves 724 and those within the group by using annotations for the purpose of facilitation and 725 coordination . Here again , the above - mentioned easy distinction between organizational and 726 content - related contributions was required . It should be noticed that the number of 727 identified organizational contributions mirrored this request ( ranging from 17 % to 40 % in 728 the various workgroups ) . This finding is in line with findings from other studies ( Lakalla et 729 al . 2002 ) . 730 Alongside the requirement for organizational annotations , these findings give hints that 731 the model of context - oriented communication theory has an insufficiency with respect to 732 the roles participating in communication processes ; not only communicator and recipient 733 and their activities but also a third role , the facilitator and his activities , should be included . 734 The role of the facilitator can be either taken on by one person ( like a tutor in seminars ) or 735 by alternating persons ( like group participants in self - organized discussions similar to the 736 case study ) . From our findings we can derive the following activities of a facilitator ( see 737 Fig . 9 in the “ Discussion of design and theory ” section ) . These findings include activities 738 for the discussion process and activities to support the understanding of the participants . 739 With respect to the discussion process a facilitator has the following activities : 740 & Initiation : starting discussions ; switching to the next topic or phase of a discourse 741 & Stimulation : encouraging participants to make contributions from varying 742 perspectives and to articulate consent and dissent . 743 & Coordinating : proposing an appropriate temporal structure and sequencing of a 744 discourse . 745 With respect to the support of understanding we state the following activities : 746 & Building bridges : pointing out similarities and relationships between contributions 747 and opinions . 748 & Summarization : mirroring the results of a phase of the discourse to the participants . 749 & Directing attention : if contributions or relationships are neglected in the discourse 750 or have been forgotten , the facilitator can redirect the attention to them . 751 & Avoiding misunderstandings : giving hints if misunderstandings are undetected , or 752 if people are in different semantic spaces . 753 For these activities , technical support was realized in KOLUMBUS . In a discussion 754 thread , the facilitator ’ s contributions are highlighted with bold type , directing attention of 755 the discussion ’ s participants to the facilitator ’ s inputs . The bold type of the facilitator ’ s 756 statements also visually structures the discussion and reduces the necessity of reconstruct - 757 ing the course of a debate when working asynchronously . By this structuring , the initiation , 758 transition over to the next phase , and the summarization are supported . T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 760 To promote contributions to an ongoing discussion two functionalities are offered : 761 & Emphasis can be placed on single contributions to a discussion by using a 762 highlighting functionality ; to label an element of a discussion thread , the facilitator 763 can choose from a variety of background colours . Marking contributions in this 764 way can be used , for example , to group similar contributions or to accentuate 765 important arguments or to stress ( intermediary ) results of a discussion . There is no 766 predefined meaning to the usage of different colours ; it was intended that a user 767 group develops the corresponding conventions without a predefined meaning . The 768 discussion of the meaning assigned to the applied colours fosters the development 769 of shared understanding of the applied functionalities . 770 & System - internal links can be established if contributions that are semantically 771 related to each other have to be interconnected . Establishing a relation between 772 elements in such a way is especially reasonable if they deal with similar aspects of 773 a topic but are distributed over several discussion threads and not directly 774 connected to each other . 775 Experiences regarding the facilitation were gathered in a study that mainly referred to 776 three different facilitation strategies and to findings about the technical support of the Fig . 9 Revised context - oriented model of communication Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 777 facilitator ’ s tasks ( more details about the study can be found in Kienle and Ritterskamp 778 2007 ) : 779 Open questions without any instructions At the beginning of the study the facilitator asked 780 open questions as is the case with traditional facilitation in face - to - face groups . Students 781 described obscurities concerning the ( subjective ) cognition of the progress in a discussion 782 thread , especially whether a discussion was finished or not . With respect to this open - 783 endedness , the students ’ preference for explicit deadlines became apparent in their answers . 784 Instruction , deadline and finalizing conclusion ( one step towards more responsibility for 785 the facilitator ) In step 2 , the facilitator used more instructional contributions which 786 included deadlines . This strategy led to higher participation levels in the discussion . The 787 analysis reveals for the first time that students worked at a rhythm similar to that given by 788 the facilitator : on deadline days more contributions were added . Although participation was 789 high , the discussions were not terminated , for example , in the form of an artefact that 790 includes the discussion results . Students felt termination or finalizing should be done by the 791 facilitator . 792 Conclusions with decisions by the facilitator ( full responsibility of the facilitator ) In a third 793 step , the facilitator intervened more than during previous steps . She not only formulated 794 more instructions that included deadlines , but terminated discussions . If some topics did not 795 come to an end by the deadline , the facilitator decided to stop , and proposed a solution . 796 Students confirmed that the progress of the process was achieved by the facilitator ’ s 797 intervention . From these findings we conclude that the activity of summarizing discussions 798 has an increased relevance in computer supported settings . 799 Results concerning the technical support of the facilitator ’ s tasks Students affirmed that 800 emphasizing a facilitator ’ s statements by using bold fonts proved to be helpful in following 801 the course of a discussion . Since the contributions of a facilitator often brought up a new 802 topic and thus resulted in a new discussion thread , emphasizing them pointed out the 803 structure of an extensive discussion more clearly . For instance , if two facilitator statements 804 were displayed one below the other , topics thus far not discussed became rapidly apparent . 805 Regarding the highlighting functionality , the facilitator emphasized that the highlighting of 806 single words would be more appropriate than highlighting the whole item . In terms of the 807 communication model and additional activities of a facilitator , this fine - grained highlighting 808 supports the facilitator in directing attention to the topic of the contribution . 809 The facilitator proposed further functionalities for an improved support for activities 810 typical to the facilitation of both face - to - face and computer supported discussions . Firstly , a 811 facilitator should be able to “ assign questions and work orders individually ” by means of a 812 collaboratively shared task list . Supporting the assignment and handling of tasks is closely 813 related to functionalities which foster the participant ’ s awareness of the current state of the 814 collaborative process in which they are involved . Furthermore , the facilitator asked for a 815 means to support synchronous voting in order to speed up the process by which participants 816 reach a group decision . T . Herrmann , A .

Topics for the guidelines are the following : 820 Integration of communicative contributions and learning material The studies support the 821 requirements derived from the context - oriented model of communication ; learning material 822 serves as context and supports the communication . The tight integration of communicative 823 contributions in the form of annotations and segmented learning material helps , in general , 824 the communicator to select the appropriate pieces of context information and the recipient 825 to better understand the utterance of the communicator . However , problems with the 826 detection of new communicative contributions occur when the content structure is growing 827 very fast — this lead to the necessity for concepts like the annotation window ( see the 828 “ Integration of material and communicative contributions ” section ) . This problem is also 829 related to the question of an appropriate granularity ; a fine granularity helps a 830 communicator to relate his expression exact to the context but results in a fast - growing 831 content tree . A coarse granularity on the other hand leads to a manageable content structure 832 but does not offer the possibility of relating the annotation to exact context information . The 833 granularity of paragraphs seems to be appropriate for the joint development of texts but has 834 its limitations for the facilitator ( see below ) . Further research seems to be necessary to get 835 hints about the “ appropriate ” granularity for discursive learning scenarios . 836 Usage of categories as context information Categories are context information that helps 837 the recipient to estimate the aim of the communicative contribution . KOLUMBUS 838 differentiates between content - related and organizational contributions as required in the 839 first round of evaluation . The studies revealed many incorrect typed contributions with the 840 default entry “ content - related ” though they included only organizational issues . This shows 841 that the participants often did not reflect on the type of their contributions and the recipients 842 had the major burden of reconstructing the real aim of the annotation . The existence of a 843 default entry is misleading because the entry suggests information that is not given by the 844 communicator . On the other hand , the findings showed that both types are relevant for 845 collaborative learning . To keep all these arguments in mind we propose the usage of the two 846 categories , content - related and organizational , without a default entry . This avoids the 847 problem of a suggested context category that is not given in the entry . 848 Usage of keywords as context information and to draw attention Keywords are a summary 849 of the communicative contribution . The communicator labels the contribution with words 850 that are important for him and that help the recipient to estimate the content . The results of 851 the studies revealed that keywords are more often used when the previous annotation was 852 written a longer time before . In timely nearby contributions the communicator seems to 853 suppose that the recipient can derive the context from the recent discussion thread . We 854 conclude that keywords are a helpful kind of context information that has to be included in 855 a CSDL system — especially in long - period asynchronous discussions . A reply - entry ( like in 856 email applications ) could support a communicator in automatic filling in the keyword when 857 contributing to an already existing discussion thread . Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 858 Annotation window as awareness feature In scenarios with the joint creation of material by 859 the group of learners , the content structure is growing very fast and the detection of new 860 annotations “ somewhere ” in this structure becomes difficult . For these scenarios an 861 annotation window comparable to an email in - and outbox gives an overview of 862 communicative contributions and serves as a helpful awareness feature . 863 Support of the facilitator Concerning the tasks of a facilitator , the results of the study suggest 864 that a facilitator occasionally has to make decisions on his own and needs to present 865 intermediate results in condensed form . Compared to face - to - face situations , the facilitator is 866 to a greater extend involved in activities concerning decision making and leadership taking 867 when moderating asynchronous computer supported discussions . Concerning the support for 868 the tasks of the facilitator , the discussion of the granularity comes up again . Here it could be 869 helpful to implement a highlighter mechanism that is applicable in a more fine - grained 870 manner ( e . g . , selecting of single words ) in order to allow a precise accentuation . 871 Concerning the technical functionalities , the results reveal that rating and negotiation 872 functionalities should be integrated in order to improve the support of group decisions and 873 convergence that lead to an end of the discursive learning process . In addition , shared task 874 lists as well as context - sensitive mechanisms would be helpful to provide a facilitator with 875 information on which suitable strategies for intervention can be based . 876 With respect to our theoretical approach we found that the applied model of 877 communication proved useful , but also needs some adaptations . It was considered as an 878 advantage by the students that the learning material was immediately integrated as content , 879 which served as context for the communicative statements that are inserted and threaded as 880 annotations . Context orientation of communication can be considered as a principal guideline 881 for the design of CSDL systems . The possibilities of minimizing explicitness by employing 882 context provides a design rationale for features such as highlighting , sketching graphical 883 relations , usage of hyperlinks , etc . It has furthermore proved helpful for explaining the 884 behaviour of students to differentiate between intentional contributions of communicative 885 statements and extra - communicative interaction with the computer . Students have to 886 understand whether or not their interaction with the computer is a communicative act — we 887 assume that the categorization of contributions was not considered such an act . Additionally , 888 the readers of annotations have to understand that they are challenged as interpreters in a 889 communicative dialogue who should try to reconstruct the ideas which are intended to be 890 shared . Therefore we argue that the communication model gives valuable backgrounds about 891 how students should be prepared for taking part in CSDL . 892 On the other hand , our observation of the positive influence of facilitation revealed a 893 crucial deficit of the common communication models ; they are all based on a dyadic 894 structure of a communicator ( sender , speaker ) vs . a recipient ( receiver , listener ) . Because of 895 the ubiquity of these models , this dyadic structure is familiar to us though our daily 896 experience is inevitably shaped by situations where a third party influences our dialogues 897 with other persons . We therefore propose a context - oriented third - party model of 898 communication as shown in Fig . 9 . It includes the role of a facilitator or communication 899 enabler who contributes supportive expressions ( 1 ) which initiate , stimulate , build bridges , 900 summarize , help to avoid misunderstandings , and coordinate . This supportive communi - 901 cation is a ( 2 ) similar activity to “ communicating an idea ”— it is an idea about how the 902 communication can be supported . The supporting expressions can become part of the 903 context ( 3 ) , e . g . , in the shape of visualizations , highlighting etc . The need for facilitation is 904 increased under the conditions of asynchronous communication ; the indirectness and the T . Herrmann , A . Kienle JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 905 possible interruptions of communication by other activities ( 4 ) require more awareness by 906 the communicators of the specific characteristics of the media that is used . Furthermore , the 907 temporal structure has to be taken into account when expressions are planned or interpreted 908 within asynchronous communication . Since interrupting activities — in particular mere 909 human - computer interaction — may distract the communicators , they have to plan ahead 910 about how they will find their way back to the topic and context of their communication 911 after a break . Likewise , the facilitator has to provide help for the overcoming of temporal 912 breaks , and she / he has to be aware of the specific temporal conditions — for example the 913 end of an asynchronous discourse has to be marked much clearer , as in the case of a face - 914 to - face meeting which ends when people are going apart . 915 Conclusion and further research 916 In this paper we described an approach to designing communication support in CSCL 917 systems . The theoretical part is a context - oriented model of communication . It explains the 918 relevance of context for activities of the participants in human communication . From this 919 model , requirements for the design of CSCL systems supporting discursive learning ( CSDL 920 systems ) are derived . One important aspect is the tight integration of communicative 921 contributions and the appropriate context information . The design of the CSDL system 922 KOLUMBUS takes these requirements into account ; it interweaves communicative 923 contributions in the form of annotations and segmented learning material that serves as 924 context . Furthermore , it addresses the requirements for the support of meta - data as context 925 information as well as an overview of annotations and the facilitation of communication 926 processes ; these requirements were gathered in the empirical field . These requirements were 927 implemented and again evaluated in different settings and learning scenarios that all aimed 928 at discursive learning . From our experience with KOLUMBUS , whose design is theory 929 driven and improved by empirical findings , we have derived conclusions which can be 930 presented as guidelines for the design of CSCL systems that support asynchronous 931 discourses : 932 & Support context orientation by integrating communication as annotations into 933 segmented learning material as context . The granularity of paragraphs is appropriate 934 for the scenario of the joint development of material . 935 & Support detailed information about the requested context information , like 936 categories and keywords . They are especially helpful in long - period settings and 937 overlapping discourses because these situations require more explicit context 938 information . Keep in mind that users have to be aware that they participate in 939 communication acts and explain the benefit of using this context information . 940 & Provide a special view that helps to overview the course of annotations . This is 941 especially useful in scenarios of discourses that start with a divergent phase where 942 annotations are connected to different items of material that are widely spread over the 943 content . 944 & Employ a communication model which takes facilitators as a third party into 945 account and promotes the design of features which support specific communication 946 acts such as initiation , stimulation , etc . 947 & Prepare students to be able to act communicatively and to be aware of the specific 948 temporal structure or problems of interruptions that are inherent in asynchronous 949 communication . Provide functions which make this awareness more feasible . Computer - Supported Collaborative Learning JrnlID 11412 _ ArtID 9045 _ Proof # 1 - 17 / 05 / 2008 U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 950 Further research is faced with the challenge of integrating synchronous and asynchronous 951 communication in a way that supports discursive learning without losing the advantages of 952 both modes ; synchronicity promotes more immediate , uninterrupted and focused interaction 953 while asynchronicity supports more deliberate reflection and more intensive research within 954 the available material . With respect to this integration , we have particularly to investigate the 955 relevance of features such as support for rating , voting or negotiation , increased immediacy 956 and visibility for and of facilitation activities , and smooth switching between different 957 communication modes . 959 References 960 Ackerman , M .
