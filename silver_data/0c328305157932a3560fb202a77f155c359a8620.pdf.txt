F . Io(cid:11)e Physico - Technical Institute , 194021 St . Petersburg , Russia ( Submitted to Advances in Physics on 6th March 2001 ) We review the recent fast progress in statistical physics of evolving networks . Interest has focused mainly on the structural properties of random complex networks in communications , biology , social sciences and economics . A number of giant arti(cid:12)cial networks of such a kind came into existence recently . This opens a wide (cid:12)eld for the study of their topology , evolution , and complex processes occurring in them . Such networks possess a rich set of scaling properties . A number of them are scale - free and show striking resilience against random breakdowns . In spite of large sizes of these networks , the distances between most their vertices are short | a feature known as the \ small - world " e(cid:11)ect . We discuss how growing networks self - organize into scale - free structures and the role of the mechanism of preferential linking . We consider the topological and structural properties of evolving networks , and percolation in these networks . We present a number of models demonstrating the main features of evolving networks and discuss current approaches for their simulation and analytical study . Applications of the general results to particular networks in Nature are discussed . We demonstrate the generic connections of the network growth processes with the general problems of non - equilibrium physics , econophysics , evolutionary biology , etc . CONTENTS I .

INTRODUCTION The Internet and World Wide Web are perhaps the most impressive creatures of our civilization ( Baran 1964 ) . [ 1 ] . Their in(cid:13)uence on us is incredible . They are part of our life , of our world . Our present and our fu - ture are impossible without them . Nevertheless , we know much less about them than one may expect . We know surprisingly little of their structure and hierarchical orga - nization , their global topology , their local properties , and various processes occurring within them . This knowledge is needed for the most e(cid:11)ective functioning of the Inter - net and WWW , for ensuring their safety , and for utilizing all of their possibilities . Certainly , the understanding of such problems is a topic not of computer science and applied mathematics , but rather of non - equilibrium sta - tistical physics . In fact , these wonderful communications nets [ 2 { 10 ] are only particular examples of a great class of evolv - ing networks . Numerous networks , e . g . , collaboration networks [ 11 { 15 ] , public relations nets [ 16 { 20 ] , citations of scienti(cid:12)c papers [ 21 { 27 ] , some industrial networks [ 11 , 12 , 28 ] , transportation networks [ 29 , 30 ] , nets of rela - tions between enterprises and agents in (cid:12)nancial markets [ 31 ] , telephone call graphs [ 32 ] , many biological networks [ 33 { 45 ] , food and ecological webs [ 46 { 52 ] , etc . , belong to it . The (cid:12)niteness of these networks sets serious restric - tions on extracting useful experimental data because of strong size e(cid:11)ects and , often , insu(cid:14)cient statistics . The large size of the Internet and WWW and their extensive and easily accessible documentation allow reliable and informative experimental investigation of their structure and properties . Unfortunately , the statistical theory of neural networks [ 53 , 54 ] seems to be rather useless for the understanding of problems of the evolution of networks , since this advanced theory does not seriously touch on the main question arising for real networks { how networks becomes speci(cid:12)cally structured during their growth . Quite recently , general features of structural organization of such networks were discovered [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 27 , 41 , 55 , 56 , 58 ] . It has become clear that their complex scale - free structure is a natural consequence of the principles of their growth . Some simple basic ideas have been proposed . Self - organization of growing net - works and processes occurring within them have been re - lated [ 59 { 63 ] to corresponding phenomena ( growth phe - nomena [ 64 ] , self - organization [ 65 { 67 ] and self - organized criticality [ 68 { 70 ] , percolation [ 71 { 73 ] , localization , etc . ) being studied by physicists for a long time . The goal of our paper is to review the recent rapid progress in understanding the evolution of networks using ideas and methods of statistical physics . The problems that we discuss relate to computer science , mathemat - ics , physics , engineering , biology , economy , and social sciences . Here , we present the point of view of physi - cists . To restrict ourselves , we do not dwell on Boolean and neural networks . II . HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The structure of networks has been studied by math - ematical graph theory [ 74 { 76 ] . Some basic ideas , used later by physicists , were proposed long ago by the in - credibly proli(cid:12)c and outstanding Hungarian mathemati - cian Paul Erd(cid:127)os and his collaborator R(cid:19)enyi [ 77 , 78 ] . Nev - ertheless , the most intriguing type of growing networks , which evolve into scale - free structures , hasn’t been stud - ied by graph theory . Most of the results of graph the - ory [ 79 , 80 ] are related to the simplest random graphs with Poisson distribution of connections [ 77 , 78 ] ( classi - cal random graph ) . Moreover , in graph theory , by de(cid:12)ni - tion , random graphs are graphs with Poisson distribution of connections ( we use this term in a much more wide sense ) . Nevertheless , one should note the very important results obtained recently by mathematicians for graphs with arbitrary distribution of connections [ 81 , 82 ] . The mostly empirical study of speci(cid:12)c large random networks such as nets of citations in scienti(cid:12)c literature has a long history [ 21 { 24 ] . Unfortunately , their limited sizes did not allow to get reliable data and describe their structure until recently . Fundamental concepts such as functioning and practi - cal organization of large communications networks were elaborated by the \ father " of the Internet , Paul Baran , [ 1 ] . Actually , many present studies are based on his orig - inal ideas and use his terminology . What is the optimal design of communications networks ? How may one en - sure their stability and safety ? These and many other vital problems were (cid:12)rst studied by P . Baran in a prac - tical context . By the middle of 90’s , the Internet and the WWW had reached very large sizes and continued to grow so rapidly that intensively developed search engines failed to cover a great part of the WWW [ 7 { 9 , 83 { 89 ] . A clear knowl - edge of the structure of the WWW has become vitally important for its e(cid:11)ective operation . The (cid:12)rst experimental data , mostly for the simplest structural characteristics of the communications net - works , were obtained in 1997 - 1999 [ 2 { 5 , 90 , 91 ] . Distri - butions of the number of connections in the networks and their surprisingly small average shortest - path lengths were measured . A special role of long - tailed , power - law distributions was revealed . After these (cid:12)ndings , physi - cists started intensive study of evolving networks in var - ious areas , from communications to biology and public relations . III . STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EVOLVING NETWORKS Let us start by introducing the objects under discus - sion . The networks that we consider are graphs consist - ing of vertices ( nodes ) connected by edges ( links ) . Edges 2 may be directed or undirected ( leading to directed and undirected networks , relatively ) . For de(cid:12)nition of dis - tances in a network , one sets lengths of all edges to be one . Here we do not consider networks with unit loops ( edges started and terminated at the same vertex ) and multiple edges , i . e . , we assume that only one edge may connect two vertices . ( One should note that multiple edges are encountered in some collaboration networks [ 14 ] . Pairs of opposing edges connect some vertices in the WWW , in networks of protein - protein interactions , and in food webs . Also , protein - protein interaction nets and food webs contain unit loops ( see below ) . Nets with \ weighted " edges are discussed in Ref . [ 92 ] . ) The structure of a network is described by its adja - cency matrix , ^ B , whose elements consist of zeros and ones . An element of the adjacency matrix of a network with undirected edges , b (cid:22)(cid:23) , is 1 if vertices (cid:22) and (cid:23) are connected , and is 0 otherwise . Therefore , the adjacency matrix of a network with undirected edges is symmetri - cal . For a network with directed edges , an element of the adjacency matrix , b (cid:22)(cid:23) , equals 1 if there is an edge from the vertex (cid:22) to the vertex (cid:23) , and equals 0 otherwise . In the case of a random network , an adjacency matrix describes only a particular member of the entire statis - tical ensemble of random graphs . Hence , what one ob - serves is only a particular realization of this statistical ensemble and the adjacency matrix of this graph is only a particular member of the corresponding ensemble of matrices . The statistics of the adjacency matrix of a random net - work contains complete information about the structure of the net , and , in principle , one has to study just the adjacency matrix . Generally , this is not an easy task , so that , instead of this , only a very restricted set of struc - tural characteristics is usually considered . A . Degree The simplest and the most intensively studied one - vertex characteristic is degree . Degree , k , of a vertex is the total number of its connections . ( In physical litera - ture , this quantity is often called \ connectivity " that has a quite di(cid:11)erent meaning in graph theory . Here , we use the mathematically correct de(cid:12)nition . ) In - degree , k i , is the number of incoming edges of a vertex . Out - degree , k o is the number of its outgoing edges . Hence , k = k i + k o . Degree is actually the number of nearest neighbors of a vertex , z 1 . Total distributions of vertex degrees of an en - tire network , P ( k i ; k o ) | the joint in - and out - degree dis - tribution , P ( k ) | the degree distribution , P i ( k i ) | the in - degree distribution , and P o ( k o ) | the out - degree dis - tribution | are its basic statistical characteristics . Here , P ( k ) = X k i P ( k i ; k (cid:0) k i ) = X k o P ( k (cid:0) k o ; k o ) ; P i ( k i ) = X k o P ( k i ; k o ) ; P o ( k o ) = X k i P ( k i ; k o ) : ( 1 ) For brevity , instead of P i ( k i ) and P o ( k o ) we usually use the notations P ( k i ) and P ( k o ) . If a network has no con - nections with the exterior , then the average in - and out - degree are equal : k i = X k i ; k o k i P ( k i ; k o ) = k o = X k i ; k o k o P ( k i ; k o ) ; ( 2 ) Although the degree of a vertex is a local quantity , we shall see that a degree distribution often determines some important global characteristics of random net - works . Moreover , if statistical correlations between ver - tices are absent , P ( k i ; k o ) totally determines the struc - ture of the network . B . Shortest path One may de(cid:12)ne a geodesic distance between two ver - tices , (cid:22) and (cid:23) , of a graph with unit length edges . It is the shortest - path length , ‘ (cid:22)(cid:23) , from the vertex (cid:22) to the vertex (cid:23) . If vertices are directed , ‘ (cid:22)(cid:23) is not necessary equal to ‘ (cid:23)(cid:22) . It is possible to introduce the distribution of the shortest - path lengths between pairs of vertices of a network and the average shortest - path length ‘ of a network . The average here is over all pairs of vertices between which a path exists and over all realizations of a network . ‘ is often called the \ diameter " of a network . It deter - mines the e(cid:11)ective \ linear size " of a network , the average separation of pairs of vertices . For a lattice of dimension d containing N vertices , obviously , ‘ (cid:24) N 1 = d . In a fully connected network , ‘ = 1 . One may roughly estimate ‘ of a network in which random vertices are connected . If the average number of nearest neighbors of a vertex is z 1 , then about z ‘ 1 vertices of the network are at a distance ‘ from the vertex or closer . Hence , N (cid:24) z ‘ 1 and then ‘ (cid:24) ln N = ln z 1 , i . e . , the average shortest - path length value is small even for very large networks . This smallness is usually referred to as a small - world e(cid:11)ect [ 11 , 12 , 93 ] . One can also introduce the maximal shortest - path length over all the pairs of vertices between which a path exists . This characteristic determines the maximal ex - tent of a network . ( In some papers the maximal shortest path is also referred to as the diameter of the network , so that we avoid to use this term . ) C . Clustering coe(cid:14)cient For the description of connections in the environ - ment closest to a vertex , one introduces the so - called 3 clustering coe(cid:14)cient . For a network with undirected edges , the number of all possible connections of the nearest neighbors of a vertex (cid:22) ( z ( (cid:22) ) 1 nearest neigh - bors ) equals z ( (cid:22) ) 1 ( z ( (cid:22) ) 1 (cid:0) 1 ) = 2 . Let only y ( (cid:22) ) of them be present . The clustering coe(cid:14)cient of this vertex , C ( (cid:22) ) (cid:17) y ( (cid:22) ) = [ z ( (cid:22) ) 1 ( z ( (cid:22) ) 1 (cid:0) 1 ) = 2 ] , is the fraction of exist - ing connections between nearest neighbors of the vertex . Averaging C ( (cid:22) ) over all vertices of a network yields the clustering coe(cid:14)cient of the network , C . The clustering coe(cid:14)cient is the probability that two nearest neighbors of a vertex are nearest neighbors also of one another . The clustering coe(cid:14)cient of the network re(cid:13)ects the \ cliquish - ness " of the mean closest neighborhood of a network ver - tex , that is , the extent to which the nearest neighbors of a vertex are the nearest neighbors of each other [ 11 ] . One should note that the notion of clustering was introduced in sociology [ 18 ] . From another point of view , C is the probability that if a triple of vertices of a network is connected together by at least two edges then the third edge is also present . One can check that C = 3 is equal to the number of triples of vertices connected together by three edges divided by the number of all connected triples of vertices . Instead of C ( (cid:22) ) , it is equally possible to use an - other related characteristic of clustering , D ( (cid:22) ) (cid:17) ( z ( (cid:22) ) 1 + y ( (cid:22) ) 1 ) = [ ( z ( (cid:22) ) 1 + 1 ) z ( (cid:22) ) 1 = 2 ] , that is , the fraction of existing connections inside of a set of vertices consisting of the vertex (cid:22) and all its nearest neighbors . D ( (cid:22) ) plays the role of local density of linkage . C ( (cid:22) ) and D ( (cid:22) ) are con - nected by the following relations : D ( (cid:22) ) = C ( (cid:22) ) + 2 z ( (cid:22) ) 1 + 1 ( 1 (cid:0) C ( (cid:22) ) ) ; C ( (cid:22) ) = D ( (cid:22) ) (cid:0) 2 z ( (cid:22) ) 1 (cid:0) 1 ( 1 (cid:0) D ( (cid:22) ) ) : ( 3 ) In a network in which all pairs of vertices are connected ( the complete graph ) C = D = 1 . For tree - like graphs , C = 0 . In a classical random graph C = M = [ N ( N (cid:0) 1 ) = 2 ] = z 1 = ( N (cid:0) 1 ) , D = M = [ N ( N + 1 ) = 2 ] = z 1 = ( N + 1 ) . Here , N is the total number of vertices of the graph , M is the total number of its edges , and z 1 is an aver - age number of the nearest neighbors of a vertex in the graph , M = z 1 N = 2 . In an ordered lattice , 0 (cid:20) C (cid:20) 1 depending on its structure . Note that 0 (cid:20) C (cid:20) 1 but 0 < 2 = ( z 1 + 1 ) (cid:20) D (cid:20) 1 . D . Size of the giant component Generally , a network may contain disconnected parts . In networks with undirected edges , it is easy to intro - duce the notion corresponding to the percolating clus - ter in the case of disordered lattices . If the relative size of the largest connected cluster of vertices of a network ( the largest connected component ) approaches a nonzero value when the network is grown to in(cid:12)nite size , the sys - tem is above the percolating threshold , and this cluster is called the giant connected component of the network . In this case , the size of the next largest cluster , etc . are small compared to the giant connected component for a large enough network . Nevertheless , size e(cid:11)ects are usu - ally strong ( see Sec . XI C ) , and for accurate measure - ment of the size of the giant connected component , large networks must be used . One may generalize this notion for networks with di - rected edges . In this case , we have to consider a cluster of vertices from each of that one can approach any vertex of this cluster . Such a cluster may be called the strongly connected component . If the largest strongly connected component contains a (cid:12)nite fraction of all vertices in the large network limit , it is called the giant strongly con - nected component . Connected clusters obtained from a directed network by ignoring directions of its edges are called weakly connected components , and one can de(cid:12)ne the giant weakly connected component of a network . E . Other many - vertex characteristics One can get a general picture of the distribution of edges between vertices in a network considering the av - erage elements of the adjacency matrix , b (cid:22)(cid:23) ( here , the averaging is over realizations of the evolution process , if the network is evolving , or over all con(cid:12)gurations , if it is static ) although this characteristic is not very informa - tive . A local characteristic , degree , k (cid:17) k 1 = z 1 can be eas - ily generalized . It is possible to introduce the number of vertices at a distance equal 2 or less from a vertex , k 2 , the number of second neighbors , z 2 (cid:17) k 2 (cid:0) k 1 , etc . Gen - eralization of the clustering coe(cid:14)cient is also straightfor - ward : one has to count all edges between n - th nearest neighbors . One may consider distributions of these quantities and their average values . Often , it is possible to (cid:12)x a vertex not by its label , (cid:22) but only by its in - and out - degrees , therefore , it is reasonable to introduce the probability P ( k i ; k o ; k 0 i ; k 0 o ) that a pair of vertices { the (cid:12)rst vertex with the in - and out - degrees k i and k o and the second one with the in - and out - degrees k 0 i and k 0 o { are connected by a directed edge going out from the (cid:12)rst vertex and coming to the second one [ 94 , 95 ] . It is easy to introduce a similar quantity for networks with undirected edges , namely the distribution P ( k 1 ; k 2 ) of the degrees of nearest neighbor vertices . This distribu - tion indicates correlations between the degrees of nearest neighbors in a network : if P ( k 1 ; k 2 ) , does not factorize , these correlations are present [ 94 , 95 ] . Unfortunately , it is hard to measure such distributions because of the poor statistics . However , one may easily observe these correla - tions studying a related characteristic { the dependence k nn ( k ) of the average degree of the nearest neighbors k nn 4 on the degree k of a vertex [ 96 ] . Similarly , it is di(cid:14)cult to measure a standard joint in - and out - degree distribution P ( k i ; k o ) . However , one may measure the dependences k i ( k o ) of the average in - degrees k i for vertices of the out - degree k o and k o ( k i ) of the av - erage out - degrees k o for vertices of the in - degree k i . One may also consider the probability , P n ( k 1 ; k n ) , that the number of vertices at a distance n or less from a ver - tex equals k n , if the degree of the vertex is k 1 , etc . Some other many - node characteristics will be introduced here - after . IV . NOTIONS OF EQUILIBRIUM AND NON - EQUILIBRIUM NETWORKS From a physical point of view , random networks may be \ equilibrium " or \ non - equilibrium " . Let us introduce these important notions using simple examples . ( a ) An example of an equilibrium random network : A classical undirected random graph [ 77 , 78 ] ( see Sec . VI ) . It is de(cid:12)ned by the following rules : ( i ) The total number of vertices is (cid:12)xed . ( ii ) Randomly chosen pairs of vertices are connected via undirected edges . Vertices of the classical random graph are statistically independent and equivalent . The construction procedure of such a graph may be thought of as the subsequent ad - dition of new edges between vertices chosen at random . When the total number of vertices is (cid:12)xed , this procedure obviously produces equilibrium con(cid:12)gurations . ( b ) The example of a non - equilibrium random network : A simple random graph growing through the simultane - ous addition of vertices and edges ( see , e . g . , Ref . [ 203 , 204 ] and Sec . XI G ) . De(cid:12)nition of this graph : ( i ) At each time step , a new vertex is added to the graph . ( ii ) Simultaneously , a pair ( or several pairs ) of ran - domly chosen vertices is connected . One sees that the system is not in equilibrium . Edges are inhomogeneously distributed over the graph . The oldest vertices are the most connected ( in statistical sense ) , and degrees of new vertices are the smallest . If , at some moment , we stop to increase the number of ver - tices but continue the random addition of edges , then the network will tend to an \ equilibrium state " but never achieve it . Indeed , edges of the network do not disap - pear , so the inhomogeneity survives . An \ equilibrium state " can be achieved only if , in addition , we allow old edges to disappear from time to time . The speci(cid:12)c case of equilibrium networks with a Pois - son degree distribution was actually the main object of graph theory over more than forty years . Physicists have started the study of non - equilibrium ( growing ) net - works . The construction procedure for an equilibrium graph with an arbitrary degree distribution P ( k ) was proposed by Molloy and Reed [ 81 , 82 ] ( note that this pro - cedure cannot be considered as quite rigorous ) : ( a ) To the vertices f (cid:22) g of the graph ascribe degrees f k (cid:22) g taken from the distribution P ( k ) . Now the graph looks like a family of hedgehogs : each vertex has k j stick - ing out quills ( see Fig . 1 ( a ) ) . ( b ) Connect at random ends of pairs of distinct quills belonging to distinct vertices ( see Fig . 1 ( b ) ) . a ) b ) FIG . 1 . The construction procedure for an equilibrium random graph with preset arbitrary degree distribution P ( k ) . ( a ) Degrees f k (cid:22) g taken from the distribution are ascribed to the vertices f (cid:22) g . ( b ) Pairs of random ends sticking out of di(cid:11)erent vertices are connected . The generalization of this construction procedure to directed equilibrium graphs with arbitrary joint in - and out - degree distributions P ( k i ; k o ) is straightforward . While speaking about random networks we should keep in mind that a particular network we observe is only one member of a statistical ensemble of all possible realiza - tions . Hence when we speak about random networks , we actually mean statistical ensembles . The canonical ensemble for an undirected network with N vertices has 2 N ( N (cid:0) 1 ) = 2 members , i . e . realizations ( recall that unit loops and multiple edges are forbidden ) . Each member of the ensemble is a distinct con(cid:12)guration of edges taken with some statistical weight . A rigorous de(cid:12)nition of a random network must contain a set of statistical weights for all con(cid:12)gurations of edges . A grand canonical ensem - ble of random graphs may be obtained using standard approaches of statistical mechanics . The result , namely the statistical ensemble of equilibrium random networks , is completely determined by the degree distribution . The above rather heuristic procedure of Molloy and Reed provides only a particular realization of the equi - librium graph . Unfortunately , this procedure is not very convenient for the construction of the entire statistical 5 ensemble , at least , for (cid:12)nite - size networks . Surprisingly , the rigorous construction of the statistical ensemble of equilibrium random graphs was made only for classical random graphs ( see Sec . VI ) , and the problem of strict formal construction of the statistical ensemble of equilib - rium random graphs with a given degree distribution is still open . ( However , see Ref . [ 97 ] for the construction procedure for the statistical ensemble of trees ) . It is possible to construct an equilibrium graph in an - other way than the Molloy - Reed procedure . Suppose one wants to obtain a large enough equilibrium undi - rected graph with a given set of vertex degrees k (cid:22) , where (cid:22) = 1 ; : : : ; N . Let us start from an arbitrary con(cid:12)gura - tion of edges connecting these vertices of degree k (cid:22) . We must \ equilibrate " the graph . For this : ( a ) Connect a pair of arbitrary vertices ( e . g . , 1 and 2 ) by an additional edge . Then the degrees of these vertices increase by one ( k 0 1 = k 1 + 1 and k 0 2 = k 2 + 1 ) . ( b ) Choose at random one of edge ends attached to vertex 1 and rewire it to a randomly chosen vertex 3 . Choose at random one of edge ends attached to vertex 2 and rewire it to a randomly chosen vertex 4 . Then k 00 1 = k 1 ; k 00 2 = k 2 and k 00 3 = k 3 + 1 ; k 00 4 = k 4 + 1 . ( c ) Repeat ( b ) until equilibrium is reached . Only two vertices of resulting network have degrees greater ( by one ) than the given degrees k (cid:22) . For a large network , this is non - essential . If , during our procedure , both the edges under rewiring are turned to be rewired to the same vertex , then , at the next step , one may rewire a pair of randomly chosen edges from this vertex . Another procedure for the same purpose is described in Ref . [ 98 ] . The notion of the statistical ensemble of growing net - works may also be introduced in a natural way . This ensemble includes all possible paths of the evolution of a network . V . EVOLVING NETWORKS IN NATURE In the present section we discuss some of the most prominent large networks in Nature starting with the most simply organized one . A . Networks of citations of scienti(cid:12)c papers The vertices of these networks are scienti(cid:12)c papers , the directed edges are citations . The growth process of the citation networks is very simple ( see Fig . 2 ) . Almost each new article contains a nonzero number of references to old ones . This is the only way to create new edges . The appearance of new connections between old vertices is impossible ( one may think that old papers are not up - dated ) . The number of references to some paper is the in - degree of the corresponding vertex of the network . old net new node FIG . 2 . Scheme of the growth of citation networks . Each new paper contains references to previously published articles or books . It is assumed that old papers are not updated , so new connections between old vertices are impossible . The average number of references in a paper is of the order of 10 1 , so such networks are sparse . In Ref . [ 27 ] , the data from an ISI database for the period 1981 { June 1997 and citations from Phys . Rev . D 11 - 50 ( 1975 - 1994 ) were used to (cid:12)nd the distributions of the number of citations , i . e . , the in - degree distributions . The (cid:12)rst network con - sists of 783 339 nodes and 6 716 198 links , the maximum number of citations is k ( max ) i = 8 904 . The second net - work contains 24 296 nodes connected by 351 872 links , and its maximum in - degree equals 2 026 . The out - degree is rather small , so the degree distribution coincides with the in - degree one in the range of large degree . Unfortunately , the sizes of these networks are not suf - (cid:12)ciently large to (cid:12)nd a conclusive functional form of the distributions . In Ref . [ 27 ] , both distributions were (cid:12)tted by the k (cid:0) 3 i dependence . The (cid:12)tting by the dependence ( k i + const ) (cid:0) (cid:13) was proposed in Ref . [ 99 ] . The exponents were estimated as (cid:13) = 2 : 9 for the ISI net and (cid:13) = 2 : 6 for the Phys . Rev . D citations . Furthermore , in Ref . [ 100 ] , the large in - degree part of the in - degree distribu - tion obtained for the Phys . Rev . D citation graph was (cid:12)tted by a power law with the exponent (cid:13) = 1 : 9 (cid:6) 0 : 2 . It was found in the same paper that the average number of references per paper increases as the citation graphs grow . The out - degree distributions ( the distribution of number of references in papers ) show exponential tails . The factor in the exponential depends on whether or not journals restrict the maximal number of pages in their papers . It is possible to estimate roughly the values of the ex - ponent knowing the size N of the network and the cut - o(cid:11) k cut of the distribution , (cid:13) (cid:25) 1 + ln N = ln k cut ( see Sec . IX D ) . Using the maximal number of citations as the cut - o(cid:11)s , the authors of the papers [ 94 , 95 ] got the estimations (cid:13) = 2 : 5 for the ISI net and (cid:13) = 2 : 3 for Phys . Rev . D . Moreover , they indicated from similar estimation that these data are also consistent with the k (cid:0) y i exp [ (cid:0) const k 1 (cid:0) y i ] form of the distribution if one sets y = 0 : 9 for the ISI net and y = 0 : 7 for Phys . Rev . D . In Ref . [ 26 ] , the very tail of a di(cid:11)erent distribution was studied . The ranking dependence of the number of cita - tions to the 1 120 most cited physicists was described by a 6 stretched exponential function . Of course , the statistics of citations collected by authors necessarily di(cid:11)er from the statistics of the citations to papers . Also , the form of the tail of the distribution should be quite di(cid:11)erent from its main part . In Ref . [ 101 ] , the process of receiving of citations by pa - pers in a growing citation network was empirically stud - ied . 1 736 papers published in Physical Review Letters in 1988 were considered , and the dynamics of receiving 83 252 citations was analysed . It was demonstrated that new citations ( incoming edges ) are distributed among pa - pers ( vertices ) with probability proportional to degree of vertices . This indicates that linear preferential attach - ment mechanism operates in this citation graph . B . Networks of collaborations The set of collaborations can be represented by the bipartite graph containing two distinct types of vertices | collaborators and acts of collaborations ( see Fig . 3 , a ) [ 61 ] . Collaborators connect together through collabora - tion acts , so in this type of a bipartite graph , direct con - nections between vertices of the same kind are absent . Edges are undirected . For instance , in the scienti(cid:12)c col - laboration bipartite graphs , one kind of vertices corre - sponds to authors and the other one is scienti(cid:12)c papers [ 13 , 14 ] . In movie actor graphs , these two kinds of vertices are actors and (cid:12)lms , respectively [ 11 , 28 , 102 ] . a ) b ) FIG . 3 . A bipartite collaboration graph ( a ) and one of its one - mode projections ( b ) [ 61 ] . Collaborators are denoted by empty circles , the (cid:12)lled circles depict acts of collaboration . Usually , instead of such bipartite graphs , their far less informative one - mode projections are used ( for the pro - jection procedure , see Fig . 3 , b ) . In particular , one can directly connect vertices - collaborators without indicat - ing acts of collaboration . Note that the clustering coef - (cid:12)cients of such one - mode projections are large because each act of collaboration simultaneously creates a num - ber of highly connected nearest neighbors . Note that , in principle , it is possible to introduce mul - tiple edges if there were several acts of collaboration be - tween the same collaborators . Also , one can consider weighted edges accounting for reduction of the \ e(cid:11)ect " of collaboration between a pair of collaborators when sev - eral participants are simultaneously involved [ 14 ] . We do not consider these possibilities here . Collaboration networks are well documented . For ex - ample , in Refs . [ 11 , 12 ] , the movie actor one - mode graph consisting of 225 226 actors is considered . The average degree is k = 61 , the average shortest path equals 3 : 65 that is close to the corresponding value 3 : 00 for the clas - sical random graph with the same k . The clustering coef - (cid:12)cient is large , C = 0 : 79 ( for the corresponding classical random graph it should be 0 : 00027 ) . Note that in Ref . [ 61 ] , another value , C = 0 : 199 , for the clustering coe(cid:14) - cient of a movie actor graph is given . The distribution of the degree of vertices ( number of collaborators ) in the movie actor network ( N = 212 250 and k = 28 : 78 ) was observed to be of a power - law form with the exponent (cid:13) = 2 : 3 [ 55 ] . In Ref . [ 102 ] , the degree distribution was (cid:12)tted by the ( k + const ) (cid:0) (cid:13) dependence with the exponent (cid:13) = 3 : 1 . Notice that , in Refs . [ 55 ] and [ 102 ] , TV series were excluded from the dataset . The reason for this is that each series is considered in the database as a single movie with , sometimes , thousands of actors . In Ref . [ 28 ] the full dataset , including series , was used , which has yielded exponential form of the de - gree distribution ( for statistical analysis , a cumulative degree distribution was used ) . Similar graphs for members of the boards of directors of the Fortune 1 000 companies , for authors of several huge electronic archives , etc . were also studied [ 13 , 14 , 61 ] . Distributions of numbers of co - directors , of collaborators that a scientist has , etc . were considered in Ref . [ 61 ] . Dis - tributions display a rather wide variance of forms , and it is usually hardly possible to observe a pure power - law dependence . One can (cid:12)nd data on structure of large scienti(cid:12)c col - laboration networks in Refs . [ 13 , 14 ] . The largest one of them , MEDLINE , contains 1 520 254 authors with 18 : 1 collaborations per author . The clustering coe(cid:14)cient equals 0 : 066 . The giant connected component covers 93 % of the network . The size of the second largest component equals 49 , i . e . , is of the order of ln N . The average short - est path is equal to 4 : 6 that is close to the corresponding classical random graph with the same average degree . The maximal shortest path is several times higher than the average shortest one and equals 24 . These data are rather typical for such networks . Mathematical ( M ) ( 70 975 di(cid:11)erent authors and 70 901 published paper ) and neuro - science ( NS ) ( 209 293 au - thors with 3 534 724 connections and 210 750 papers ) journals issued in the period 1991 - 1998 were scanned in Refs . [ 15 , 101 ] . Degree distributions of these collaborat - ing networks were (cid:12)tted by power laws with exponents 2 : 4 ( M ) and 2 : 1 ( NS ) . What is important , it was found that the mean degrees of these networks were not con - stant but grew linearly as the numbers of their vertices increased . Hence , the networks became more dense . The 7 average shortest - path lengths in these graphs and their clustering coe(cid:14)cients decrease with time . New edges were found to be preferentially attached to vertices with the high number of connections . The prob - ability that a new vertex is attached to a vertex with a degree k was proportional to k y with the y exponent equal to 0 : 8 (cid:6) 0 : 1 , so that some deviations from a lin - ear dependence were noticeable . However , new edges emerged between the pairs of already existing vertices with the rate proportional to the product of the degrees of vertices in a pair . Very similar results were also obtained for the actor collaboration graph consisting of 392 340 vertices and 33 646 882 edges [ 101 ] . In Ref . [ 103 ] , the preferential attachment process within collaboration nets of the Medline database ( 1994 - 1999 : 1 648 660 distinct names ) and the Los - Alamos E - print Archive ( 1995 - 2000 : 58 342 distinct names ) was studied . In fact , a relative probability that an edge added at time t connects to a vertex of degree k was measured . This probability was observed to be a linear function of k until large enough degrees , so that a linear preferential attachment mechanism operates in such networks ( com - pare with Ref . [ 15 ] ) . However , the empirical dependence saturated for k & 150 in the Los - Alamos E - print Archive collaboration net or even fell o(cid:11) for k & 600 in the Med - line network . C . Communications networks , the WWW , and the Internet Roughly speaking , the Internet is a net of intercon - nected vertices : hosts ( computers of users ) , servers ( com - puters or programs providing a network service that also may be hosts ) , and routers that arrange tra(cid:14)c across the Internet , see Fig . 4 . Connections are undirected , and tra(cid:14)c ( including its direction ) changes all the time . Routers are united in domains . In January of 2001 , the Internet contained already about 100 millions hosts . However , it is not the hosts that determine the structure of the Internet , but rather , routers and domains . In July of 2000 , there were about 150 000 routers in the Internet [ 104 ] . Latter , the number rose to 228 265 ( data from Ref . [ 105 ] ) . Thus , one can consider the topology of the Inter - net on a router level or inter - domain topology [ 5 ] . In the latter case , it is actually a small network . domain domain domain hosts routers FIG . 4 . Naive scheme of the structure of the Internet [ 5 ] . The World Wide Web is the array of its documents plus hyper - links { mutual references in these documents . Although hyper - links are directed , pairs of counter - links , in principle , may produce undirected connections . Web documents are accessible through the Internet ( wires and hardware ) , and this determines the relation between the Internet and the WWW . 1 . Structure of the Internet On the inter - domain level , the Internet is a really small sparse network with the following basic characteristics [ 5 ] . In November of 1997 , it consisted of 3 015 vertices and 5 156 edges , so the average degree was 3 : 42 , the max - imal degree of a vertex equaled 590 . In April of 1998 , there were 3 530 vertices and 6 432 edges , the average de - gree was 3 : 65 , the highest degree was 745 . In December of 1998 there were 4 389 vertices and 8 256 edges , so the average degree was 3 : 76 and the maximal degree equaled 979 . The average shortest path is found to be about 4 as it should be for the corresponding classical random graph , the maximal shortest path is about 10 . The degree distribution of this network was reported to be of a power - law form , P ( k ) / k (cid:0) (cid:13) where (cid:13) (cid:25) 2 : 2 ( November of 1997 { 2 . 15 , April of 1998 { 2 . 16 , and De - cember of 1998 { 2 . 20 ) [ 5 ] . In fact , it is hard to achieve this precision for a network of such a size . One may estimate the value of the exponent using the highest de - grees ( see Eq . ( 52 ) in Sec . IX D ) . Such estimations con(cid:12)rm the reported values . For November of 1977 , one gets (cid:13) (cid:25) 1 + ln 3015 = ln590 = 2 : 22 , for April of 1998 { (cid:13) (cid:25) 2 : 24 , and for December of 1998 { (cid:13) (cid:25) 2 : 26 . One should note that , in paper [ 5 ] , the dependence of a node degree on its rank , k ( r ) , was also studied . A power law ( Zipf law ) was observed , k ( r ) / r (cid:0) (cid:16) , but , as one can check , the reported values of the (cid:16) exponent are incon - sistent with the corresponding ones of (cid:13) . On the router level , according to relatively poor data from 1995 [ 5 , 106 ] , the Internet consisted of 3888 vertices 8 and 5012 edges , with the average degree equal to 2 . 57 and the maximal degree equal to 39 . The degree distribution of this network was (cid:12)tted by a power - law dependence with the exponent , (cid:13) (cid:25) 2 : 5 . Note that the estimation from the maximal degree value gives a quite di(cid:11)erent value , (cid:13) (cid:25) 1 + ln 3888 = ln39 = 3 : 3 , so that the empirical value of the (cid:13) exponent is not very reliable . In 2000 , the Internet has already consisted of about 150 000 routers connected by 200 000 links [ 104 ] . The degree distribution was found to \ lend some support to the conjecture that a power law governs the degree dis - tribution of real networks " [ 104 ] . If this is true , one can estimate from this degree distribution that its (cid:13) exponent is about 2 : 3 . In Ref . [ 5 ] , the distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the Internet graph was studied . The ranking plots for large eigenvalues (cid:21) ( r ) was obtained ( enumeration is started from the largest eigenvalue ) . For all three studied inter - domain graphs , approximately , (cid:21) ( r ) / r (cid:0) 0 : 5 . From this we get the form of the tail of the eigenvalue spectra , G ( (cid:21) ) / (cid:21) (cid:0) ( 1 + 1 = 0 : 5 ) = (cid:21) (cid:0) 3 : 0 ( we used the relation between the exponent of the distribu - tion and the ranking one that is discussed in Sec . IX D ) . For the inter - router - 95 graph , (cid:21) ( r ) / r (cid:0) 0 : 2 . Note that these dependences were observed for only the 20 largest eigenvalues . More recent data on the structure of the Inter - net are collected by the National Laboratory for Ap - plied Network research ( NLANR ) . On its Web site http : / / moat . nlanr . net / , one can (cid:12)nd extensive Internet routing related information being collected since Novem - ber 1997 . For nearly each day of this period , NLANR has a map of connections of operating \ autonomous sys - tems " ( AS ) , which approximately map to Internet Ser - vice Providers . These maps ( undirected networks ) are closely related to the Internet graph on the inter - domain level . For example , on 14 . 11 . 1997 , there were observed 3042 AS numbers with 5595 interconnections , the average de - gree was k = 3 : 68 ; on 09 . 11 . 1998 , these values were 4 301 , 8 589 , and 3 : 99 , respectively ; on 06 . 12 . 1999 , were 6 301 , 13 485 , and 4 : 28 , but on 08 . 12 . 1999 , there were only 768 AS numbers and 1 857 interconnections ( ! ) , so k = 4 : 84 . Hence , (cid:13)uctuations in time are very strong . The statistical analysis of these data was made in Ref . [ 96 ] . The data were averaged , and for 1997 the following average values were obtained . The mean degree of the network was equal to 3 : 47 , the clustering coe(cid:14)cient was 0 : 18 , and the average shortest - path length was 3 : 77 . For 1998 , the corresponding values were 3 : 62 , 0 : 21 , and 3 : 76 respectively . For 1999 , they were 3 : 82 , 0 : 24 , and 3 : 72 respectively . The average shortest - path lengths are close to the lengths for corresponding classical random graphs but the clustering coe(cid:14)cients are very large . Notice that the density of connections increases as the Internet grows . One may say , the Internet shows accelerated growth . In Ref . [ 107 ] , the dependence of the total number of inter - connections ( and the average degree ) on the number of AS was (cid:12)tted by a power law . Unfortunately the varia - tion ranges of these quantities are too small to reach any reliable conclusion . In Ref . [ 96 ] , the following problem was considered . New edges can connect together pairs of new and old , or old and old vertices . Were do they emerge , between what particular vertices ? The mean ratio of the number of new links emerging between new and old vertices and the number of new connections between already existing vertices was 0 : 34 , 0 : 48 , and 0 : 53 in 1997 , 1998 , and 1999 , respectively . Thus the Internet structure is very distinct from citation graphs . The degree distributions for each of these three years were found to follow a power law form with the exponent (cid:13) (cid:25) 2 : 2 , which is in agreement with Ref . [ 5 ] . Further - more , in Ref . [ 96 ] , from the data of 1998 , the dependence of the average degree of the nearest neighbors of a ver - tex on its degree , k nn ( k ) was obtained . This slowly de - creasing function was approximately (cid:12)tted by a power law with the exponent 0 : 5 . Such a dependence indicates strong correlations in the distribution of connections over the network . Vertices of large degree usually have weakly connected nearest neighbors , and vice versa . Notice that the measurement of the average degree of the nearest neighbors of a vertex vs . its degree is an e(cid:11)ec - tive way to measure correlations between degrees of sep - arate vertices . As explained above , direct measurement of the joint distribution P ( k 1 ; k 2 ) is di(cid:14)cult because of inevitably poor statistics . In principle , the behavior observed in Ref . [ 96 ] is typi - cal for citation graphs growing under mechanism of pref - erential linking ( see Sec . IX I ) . However , as indicated above , most of connections in the Internet emerge be - tween already existing sites . If the process of attach - ment of these edges is preferential , strongly connected sites usually have strongly connected nearest neighbors , unlike what was observed in Ref . [ 96 ] ( see Sec . IX I ) . A di(cid:14)culty is that vertices in the Internet are at least of two distinct kinds . In Ref . [ 96 ] , the di(cid:11)erence between \ stub " and \ transit domains " of the Internet is noticed . Stub domains have no connections between them and connect to transit domains , which are , contrastingly , well inter - connected . Therefore , new connections or rewirings are possible not between all vertices . This may be reason of the observed correlations . A di(cid:11)erent classi(cid:12)cation of the Internet sites was used in Ref . [ 108 ] . The vertices of the Internet were separated into two groups , namely \ users " and \ providers " . Interaction between these two kinds of sites leads to the self - organization of the growing network into a scale - free structure . The process of the attachment of new edges in these maps of Internet was empirically studied in Ref . [ 101 ] . It was found that the probability that a new edge is at - tached to a vertex is a linear function of the vertex degree . A very important feature of the Internet , both on the AS ( or the inter - domain ) level and on the level of routers , is that its vertices are physically attached to speci(cid:12)c places in the world and have their (cid:12)xed geographic co - 9 ordinates . The geographic places of vertices and the dis - tribution of Euclidean distances are essential for the re - sulting structure of the Internet . This factor was studied and modeled in a recent paper [ 105 ] . It was observed that routers and AS correlate with the population density . All three sets { population , router , and AS space densities { form fractal structures in space . The fractal dimensions of these fractals were found to be approximately 1 : 5 ( the data for North America ) . Maps of AS and the map of 228 265 routers were analysed . In particular , the average shortest distance between two routers was found to be approximately 9 [ 105 ] . In Ref . [ 109 ] , the structure of the Internet was consid - ered using an analogy with river networks . In such an approach , a particular terminal is treated as the outlet of a river basin . The paths from this terminal to all other addresses form the structure of this basin . As for usual river networks , the probability , P ( n ) , that a ( randomly chosen ) point connects n other points uphill , can be in - troduced . In fact , n is the size of the basin connected to some point , and P ( n ) is the distribution of basin sizes . For river networks forming a fractal structure [ 110 ] , this distribution is of a power - law form , P ( n ) / n (cid:0) (cid:28) , where values of the (cid:28) exponent are slightly lower 3 = 2 [ 111 ] . For the Internet , it was found that (cid:28) = 1 : 9 (cid:6) 0 : 1 [ 109 ] . 2 . Structure of the WWW Let us (cid:12)rst discuss , how the Web grows , that is , how new pages appear in it ( see Fig . 5 ) . Here we describe only two simple ways to add a new document . ( i ) Suppose , you want create your own personal home page . First you prepare it , put references to some pages of the Web ( usually several references but , in principle , the references may be absent ) , etc . But this is only the (cid:12)rst step . You have to make it accessible in the Web , to launch it . You come to your system administrator , he puts a reference to it ( usually one reference ) in the home page of your institution , and that is more or less all { your page is in the World Wide Web . ( ii ) There is another way of having new documents appear in the Web . Imagine that you already have your personal home page and want to launch a new document . The process is even simpler than the one described above . You simply insert at least one reference to the document into your page , and that is enough for the document to be included in the World Wide Web . We should note also that old documents can be updated , so new hyper - links between them can appear . Thus , the WWW growth is much more complex process than the growth of citation networks . new node old net FIG . 5 . Scheme of the growth of the WWW ( compare with Fig . 2 ) . A new document ( page ) must have at least one incoming hyper - link to be accessible . Usually it has several references to existing documents of the Web but , in principle , these references may be absent . Old pages can be updated , so new hyper - links can appear between them . The structure of the WWW was studied experimen - tally in Refs . [ 2 { 4 , 90 , 91 ] and the power - law form of var - ious distributions was reported . These studies cover dif - ferent sub - graphs of the Web and even relate to its dif - ferent levels . The global structure of the entire Web was described in the recent paper [ 6 ] . In this study , the crawl from Altavista is used . The most important results are the following . In May of 1999 , from the point of view of Altavista , the Web consisted of 203 (cid:2) 10 6 vertices ( URLs , i . e . , pages ) and 1466 (cid:2) 10 6 hyper - links . The average in - and out - degree were k i = k o = 7 : 22 . In October of 1999 there were already 271 (cid:2) 10 6 vertices and 2130 (cid:2) 10 6 hyper - links . The average in - and out - degree were k i = k o = 7 : 85 . This means that during this period , 68 (cid:2) 10 6 pages and 664 (cid:2) 10 6 hyper - links were added , that is , 9 : 8 extra hyper - links appeared per one additional page . Therefore , the number of hyper - links grows faster than the number of vertices . The in - and out - degree distributions are found to be of a power - law form with the exponents (cid:13) i = 2 : 1 and (cid:13) o = 2 : 7 that con(cid:12)rms earlier data of Albert et al [ 2 ] on the nd . edu subset of the WWW ( 325 000 pages ) . These distributions were also (cid:12)tted by the dependences ( k + c i ; o ) (cid:0) (cid:13) i ; o with some constants c i ; o [ 61 ] . For the in - degree distribution , the (cid:12)tting provides c i = 1 : 25 and (cid:13) i = 2 : 10 , and for the out - degree distribution , c o = 6 : 94 and (cid:13) o = 2 : 82 . Note that the (cid:12)t is only for nonzero in - , out - degrees k i ; k o . The probabilities P ( k i = 0 ) and P ( k o = 0 ) were not measured experimentally . The rela - tion between them can be found by employing Eq . ( 2 ) . The relative sizes of giant components yield a basic information about the global topology of a directed net - work , and , in particular , about the WWW . Let us assume that a large directed graph has both the giant weakly con - nected component ( GWCC ) and the giant strongly con - nected component ( GSCC ) ( see Sec . III D ) . Then its gen - eral global structure can be represented in the following form ( see Fig . 6 ) [ 6 , 112 ] . 10 DC GOUT GIN TENDRILS GSCC GWCC FIG . 6 . Structure of a directed graph when the giant strongly connected component is present [ 112 ] ( see the text ) . Also , the structure of the WWW ( compare with Fig . 9 of Ref . [ 6 ] ) . If one ignores the directedness of edges , the network consists of the giant weakly connected component ( GWCC ) | actually , the usual percolating cluster | and disconnected components ( DC ) . Accounting for the directedness of edges , the GWCC contains the following components : ( a ) the gi - ant strongly connected component ( GSCC ) , that is , the set of vertices reachable from its every vertex by a directed path ; ( b ) the giant out - component ( GOUT ) , the set of vertices ap - proachable from the GSCC by a directed path ( includes the GSCC ) ; ( c ) the giant in - component ( GIN ) , contains all vertices from which the GSCC is approachable ( includes the GSCC ) ; ( d ) the tendrils ( TE ) , the rest of the GSCC , i . e . the vertices which have no access to the GSCC and are not reachable from it . In particular , this part includes something like \ tendrils " [ 6 ] but also there are \ tubes " and numerous clusters which are only \ weakly " connected . Note that our de(cid:12)nitions of the GIN and GOUT di(cid:11)er from the de(cid:12)nitions of Refs . [ 6 , 61 ] : the GSCC is included into both GIN and GOUT , so the GSCC is the interception of the GIN and GOUT . We shall show in Sec . XIB that this de(cid:12)nition is natural . At (cid:12)rst , it is possible to extract the GWCC . The rest of the network consists of disconnected clusters { \ dis - connected components " ( DC ) . The GWCC consists of : ( a ) the GSCC { from each vertex of the GSCC , there exists a directed path to any other its vertex ; ( b ) the giant out - component ( GOUT ) { the vertices which are reachable from the GSCC by a directed path , so that GOUT includes GSCC ; ( c ) the giant in - component ( GIN ) { the vertices from which one can reach the GSCC by a directed path so that GIN includes GSCC ; ( d ) the tendrils ( T ) { the rest of the GWCC . This part consists of the vertices which have no access to the GSCC and are not reachable from it . In particular , it includes indeed something like \ tendrils " but also there are \ tubes " and numerous clusters which are only weakly connected . Notice that , in contrast to Refs . [ 6 , 61 ] , the above de - (cid:12)ned GIN and GOUT include GSCC . In Sec . XI B we shall show that this de(cid:12)nition is natural . One can write Network = GWCC + DC and GWCC = GIN + GOUT (cid:0) GSCC + TE : According to Ref . [ 6 ] , in May of 1999 , the entire Web , containing 203 (cid:2) 10 6 pages , consisted of | the GWCC , 186 (cid:2) 10 6 pages ( 91 % of the total number of pages ) , and | the DC , 17 (cid:2) 10 6 pages . In turn , the GWCC included : | the GSCC , 56 (cid:2) 10 6 pages , | the GIN , 99 (cid:2) 10 6 pages , | the GOUT , 99 (cid:2) 10 6 pages , and | the TE , 44 (cid:2) 10 6 pages . Both distributions of the sizes of strongly connected components and of the sizes of weakly connected ones were (cid:12)tted by power - law dependences with exponents ap - proximately 2 : 5 . The probability that a directed path is present between two random vertices was estimated as 24 % . For pairs of pages of the WWW between which directed paths exist , the average shortest - directed - path length equals 16 . For pairs between which at least one undirected path exists , the average shortest - undirected - path length equals 7 . The value of the average shortest - directed - path length estimated from data extracted from the nd . edu subset of the WWW was 19 [ 2 ] . This (cid:12)rst published value for the \ diameter " of the Web was obtained in a non - trivial way ( it is not so easy to (cid:12)nd the shortest path in large net - works ) . ( i ) The in - degree and out - degree distributions were measured in the nd . edu domain . ( ii ) A set of small model networks of di(cid:11)erent sizes N with these in - degree distribution and out - degree distribution was constructed . ( iii ) For each of these networks , the average shortest - path length ‘ was found . Its size dependence was estimated as ‘ ( N ) (cid:25) 0 : 35 + 2 : 06 lg N . ( iv ) ‘ ( N ) was extrapolated to N = 800 000 000 , that is , the estimation of the size of the WWW in 1999 . The result , i . e . ‘ ( 800 000 000 ) (cid:25) 19 , is very close to the above cited value ‘ ( 200 000 000 ) = 16 of Ref . [ 6 ] if one accounts for the di(cid:11)erence of sizes . The maximal shortest path between nodes belonging to the GSCC equals 28 . The maximal shortest directed path for nodes of the WWW between which a directed path exists is greater than 500 ( some estimates indicate that it may be even 1000 ) . Although the GSCC of the WWW is rather small , most pages of the WWW belong to the GWCC . Furthermore , even if all links to pages with in - degree larger than 2 are removed , the GWCC does not disappear . This is clearly demonstrated by the data of Ref . [ 6 ] : The size of the GWCC of the Web ( visible by Altavista in May 1999 ) is 186 (cid:2) 10 6 pages . 11 If all in - links to pages with k i (cid:21) k ( max ) i = 1000 ; 100 ; 10 ; 5 ; 4 ; and 3 are removed , the size of the re - taining GWCC is 177 (cid:2) 10 6 ; 167 (cid:2) 10 6 ; 105 (cid:2) 10 6 ; 59 (cid:2) 10 6 ; 41 (cid:2) 10 6 ; and 15 (cid:2) 10 6 pages , respectively . The Web grows much faster than the possibilities of hardware . Even the best search engines index less than one half of all pages of the Web [ 7 , 8 , 83 , 86 ] . Update of (cid:12)les cached by them for quick search usually takes many months . The only way to improve the situation is index - ing of special areas of the WWW , \ cyber - communities " , to provide possibility of an e(cid:14)cient specialized search [ 10 , 84 , 87 , 88 , 90 , 91 , 113 { 116 ] . hubs authorities FIG . 7 . A bipartite directed sub - graph in the Web being used for indexing cyber - communities [ 90 , 91 ] . Natural objects for such indexing are speci(cid:12)c bipartite sub - graphs ( see Fig . 7 ) [ 90 , 91 ] . One should note that the directed graphs of this kind have a di(cid:11)erent struc - ture than the bipartite graphs described in Sec . V B . After separation from the other part of a network , they consist of only two kinds of nodes { \ hubs " ( fans ) and \ authorities " ( idols ) . Each hub connects to all the au - thorities of this graph . Let it be h hubs and a authorities in the bipartite graph . Each of hubs , by de(cid:12)nition , must have a links directed to each of a authorities . Hence , the number of links between subsets of hubs and authorities equals ha . Some extra number of connections may be inside of these two subsets . The distribution of the number of such bipartite sub - graphs in the Web , N b ( h ; a ) was studied in Refs . [ 90 , 91 ] . For a (cid:12)xed number of hubs , N b ( h = (cid:12)xed ; a ) resembles a power - law dependence , and for a (cid:12)xed number authori - ties , N b ( h ; a = (cid:12)xed ) resembles an exponential one when h is small . We should note that these data are poor . One can also consider the structure of the Web on an - other level . In particular , in Ref . [ 117 ] , the in - degree dis - tribution for the domain level of Web in spring of 1997 was studied , where each vertex ( Web site ) is a separate domain name , and the value 1 : 94 for the corresponding exponent was reported . The network consisted of 259 794 vertices . Measurements of the clustering coe(cid:14)cient of the Web on this level [ 118 ] have shown that it is much larger than it should be for the corresponding classical random graph . The data were extracted from the same crawl containing 259 794 sites . Several other empirical distributions were obtained , which do not relate directly to the global structure of the Web but indicate some of its properties . Huberman and Adamic [ 3 ] found that the distribution of the num - ber of pages in a Web site also demonstrates a power - law dependence ( Web site is a set of linked pages on a Web server ) . From their analysis of sets of 259 794 and 525 882 Web sites covered by Alexa and Infoseek it follows that the exponent in this power law is about 1 : 8 . Note that the power - law dependence seems not very pronounced in this case . A power - law dependence was indicated at the distribution of the number of visits ( connections ) to the Web sites [ 119 ] . The value of the corresponding exponent was estimated as 2 : 0 . The (cid:12)t is rather poor . One should stress that usually what experimentalists indicate as a power - law dependence is actually a lin - ear (cid:12)t for a rather narrow range on a log - log plot . It is nearly impossible to obtain some functional form for the degree distribution directly because of strong (cid:13)uc - tuations . To avoid them , the cumulative distribution P cum ( k ) = R 1 k dk P ( k ) is usually used [ 28 ] . Neverthe - less , the restricted sizes of the studied networks often lead to implausible interpretation ( see the discussion of the (cid:12)nite size e(cid:11)ects in Secs . IX C and IX D ) . One has to keep this in mind while working with such experimental data . D . Biological networks 1 . Structure of neural networks Let us consider the rich structure of a neural net - work of a tiny organism , classical C . elegans . 282 neu - rons form the network of directed links with average de - gree k = 14 [ 11 , 12 ] . The in - and out - degree distribu - tions are exponential . The average shortest - path length measured without account of directness of edges is 2 : 65 , and the clustering coe(cid:14)cient equals 0 : 26 . Therefore , the network displays the small - world e(cid:11)ect , and the clus - tering coe(cid:14)cient is much larger than the characteris - tic value for the corresponding classical random graph , C = 0 : 26 (cid:29) 14 = 282 (cid:24) 0 : 05 . 2 . Networks of metabolic reactions The valuable example of a biological network with the extremely rich topological structure is provided by the network of metabolic reactions [ 33 , 34 , 67 ] . This is a par - ticular case of chemical reactions graphs [ 67 , 120 , 121 ] . At present , such networks are documented for several or - ganisms . Their vertices are substrates { molecular com - pounds , and the edges are metabolic reactions connecting 12 substrates . According to [ 41 ] ( see also [ 122 ] ) , incoming links for a particular substrate are reactions in which it participates as a product . Outgoing links are reactions in which it is an educt . Sizes of such networks in 43 organisms investigated in [ 41 ] are between 200 and 800 . The average shortest - path length is about 3 , k i (cid:24) k o (cid:24) 2 : 5 (cid:0) 4 : 0 . Although the net - works are very small , the in - and out - degree distributions were interpreted [ 41 ] as scale - free , i . e . , of a power - law form with the exponents , (cid:13) i (cid:25) (cid:13) o (cid:25) 2 : 2 . In Ref . [ 123 ] , one may (cid:12)nd another study of the global structure of metabolic reaction networks . The networks were treated as undirected . For a network of the Es - cherichia coli , consisting of 282 nodes , the average de - gree k (cid:24) 7 . The average shortest - path length was found to be equal to 2 : 9 . The clustering coe(cid:14)cient is C (cid:25) 0 : 3 , that is , much larger than for the corresponding classical random network , 7 = 282 (cid:25) 0 : 025 . The distribution of short cycles in large metabolic net - works is considered in Ref . [ 124 ] . 3 . Protein networks A genomic regulatory system can be thought of as an extremely large directed network [ 67 ] . Vertices in this network are distinct components of the genomic regu - latory system , and each directed edge points from the regulating to the regulated component . A very important aspect of gene function is protein - protein interactions { \ the number and identity of pro - teins with which the products of duplicate genes in an organism interact " ( see Ref . [ 45 ] for a brief introduction in the topic ) . The vertices of the protein - protein inter - action network are proteins and the directed edges are , usually , pairwise protein - protein interactions . Two ver - tices may be connected by a pair of opposing edges , and the network also contains unit loops , so that its general structure resembles the structure of a food web ( see Fig . 8 ) . Recently large maps of protein - protein interaction networks were obtained [ 40 , 42 , 43 ] which may be used for structural analysis . In Ref . [ 44 ] ( for details see Ref . [ 122 ] ) , the distribution of connections in the protein - protein interaction network of the yeast , S . cerevisiae was studied using the map from Ref . [ 40 ] ( see also Ref . [ 45 ] ) . The network contains 1 870 vertices and 2 240 edges . The degree distribution was in - terpreted as a power - law ( scale - free ) dependence with an exponential cut - o(cid:11) at the point k c (cid:25) 20 . This value is so small that it is di(cid:14)cult to (cid:12)nd the exponent of the degree distribution . The approximate value (cid:13) (cid:25) 2 : 5 was obtained in Ref . [ 45 ] . In addition , in Ref . [ 44 ] , the tolerance of this network against random errors ( random deletion of proteins ) and its fragility against the removal of the most connected vertices were studied . The random errors were found to be rather non - dangerous , but single deletion of one of the most connected proteins ( having more than 15 links ) was lethal with high probability . 4 . Ecological and food webs Food webs of species - rich ecosystems are directed networks , where vertices are distinct species , and di - rected edges connect pairs | a specie - eater and its food [ 46 { 51 , 125 ] . In Refs . [ 48 , 49 ] , structures of three food webs were studied ignoring the directedness of their edges . The networks considered in Refs . [ 48 , 49 ] are very small . ( i ) The food web of Ythan estuary consists of N = 93 vertices . The average degree is k = 8 : 70 , the average clustering coe(cid:14)cient is equal to C = 0 : 22 , the average shortest - path length is ‘ = 2 : 43 . ( ii ) Silwood park web ( more precisely speaking , this is a sub - web ) . N = 154 , k = 4 : 75 , C = 0 : 15 , ‘ = 3 : 40 . ( iii ) The food web of Little Rock lake . N = 182 , k = 26 : 05 , C = 0 : 35 , ‘ = 2 : 22 . The clustering coe(cid:14)cients obtained for these networks essentially exceed the corresponding values for the classi - cal random graphs with the same total number of vertices and edges . However , the measured average shortest - path lengths of these webs do not deviate noticeably from the corresponding values for the classical random graphs . Furthermore , the degree distributions of the (cid:12)rst two webs were (cid:12)tted by power laws with the exponents (cid:13) (cid:25) 1 : 0 and (cid:13) (cid:25) 1 : 1 for the Ythan estuary web and for the Sil - wood park web , correspondingly . This allowed authors of Refs . [ 48 , 49 ] to consider them as scale - free networks ( however , see Refs . [ 50 , 51 ] where the degree distributions in such food webs were interpreted as of an exponential - like form ) . These are the smallest networks for which a power - law distribution was ever reported . For the third food web , any functional (cid:12)tting turned to be impossible . Additionally , in Ref . [ 49 ] , the stability of food webs against random or intentional removal of vertices was considered . The results were typical for scale - free net - works ( see Sec . XI C ) . FIG . 8 . Typical food web . Cannibalism and mutual eat - ing are widespread . Food webs have a rather speci(cid:12)c structure . They are directed , include unit loops , that is , cannibalism , and two opposing edges may connect a pair of vertices ( mutual eating ) [ 47 , 52 ] ( see Fig . 8 , compare with the structure 13 of a protein - protein interaction network ) . Therefore , the maximal possible number of edges ( trophic links ) in a food web containing N vertices ( trophic species ) is equal to 2 N ( N (cid:0) 1 ) = 2 + N = N 2 . Food webs are actually dense : the total number L of edges is high . The values of the ra - tion L = N 2 for seven typical food webs with N = 25 (cid:0) 92 were found to be in the range between 0 : 061 and 0 : 32 [ 47 ] . Authors of Ref . [ 52 ] observed that this leads to an extreme smallness of food webs . Edges were treated as undirected and the average shortest - path lengths were then measured to be in the range between 1 : 44 and 2 : 55 . We should emphasize that it is hard to (cid:12)nd well de - (cid:12)ned and large food webs . This seriously hinders their statistical analysis . 5 . Word Web of human language Ferrer and Sol(cid:19)e ( 2001 ) [ 126 ] constructed a net of funda - mental importance , namely the network of distinct words of human language . Here we call it Word Web . The Word Web is constructed in the following way . The vertices of the web are the distinct words of language , and the undi - rected edges are connections between interacting words . It is not so easy to de(cid:12)ne the notion of word interac - tion in a unique way . Nevertheless , di(cid:11)erent reasonable de(cid:12)nitions provide very similar structures of the Word Web . For instance , one can connect the nearest neigh - bors in sentences . Without going into details , this means that the edge between two distinct words of language ex - ists if these words are the nearest neighbors in at least one sentence in the bank of language . In such a de(cid:12)ni - tion , multiple links are absent . One also may connect the second nearest neighbors and account for other types of correlations between words [ 126 ] . In fact , the Word Web displays the cooccurrence of the words in sentences of a language . Two slightly di(cid:11)erent methods were used in Ref . [ 126 ] to construct the Word Web . The two resulting webs ob - tained after processing 3 = 4 million words of the British National Corpus ( a collection of text samples of both spo - ken and written modern British English ) have nearly the same degree distributions ( see Fig . 9 ) and each contains about 470 000 vertices . The average number of connec - tions of a word ( the average degree ) is k (cid:25) 72 . As one sees from Fig . 9 , the degree distribution comprises two dis - tinct regions with quite di(cid:11)erent power - law dependences . The range of the degree variation is really large , so the result looks convincing . The exponent of the power law in the low - degree region is approximately 1 : 5 , and in the high - degree region is close to 3 ( the value 2 : 7 was re - ported in Ref . [ 126 ] ) . 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 Numbers of connections of words , k 10 - 10 10 - 8 10 - 6 10 - 4 10 - 2 10 0 D i s t r i bu t i on o f nu m be r s o f c onne c t i on s , P ( k ) k cross cut k FIG . 9 . The distribution of the numbers of connections ( degrees ) of words in the word web in a log - log scale [ 126 ] . Empty and (cid:12)lled circles show the distributions of the number of connections obtained in Ref . [ 126 ] for two di(cid:11)erent meth - ods of the construction of the Word Web . The solid line is the result of theory of Ref . [ 127 ] ( see Sec . IXJ where the pa - rameters of the Word Web , namely , the size t (cid:25) 470 000 and the average number of connections of a node , k ( t ) (cid:25) 72 , were used . The arrows indicate the theoretically obtained point of crossover , k cross between the regions with di(cid:11)erent power laws , and the cuto(cid:11) k cut due to the size e(cid:11)ect . For a better comparison , the theoretical curve is displaced upward to ex - clude two experimental points with the smallest k ( note that the comparison is impossible in the region of the smallest k where the empirical distribution essentially depends on the de(cid:12)nition of the Word Web ) . The complex empirical degree distribution of the Word Web was described without (cid:12)tting using a simple model of the evolution of human language [ 127 ] ( see Fig . 9 and Sec . IX J ) . E . Electronic circuits In Ref . [ 128 ] , the structure of large electronic circuits was analysed . Electronic circuits were viewed as undi - rected random graphs . Their vertices are electronic com - ponents ( resistors , diodes , capacitors , etc . in analog cir - cuits and logic gates in digital circuits ) and the undi - rected edges are wires . The networks considered in Ref . [ 128 ] have sizes N in the range between 20 and 2 (cid:2) 10 4 and the average degree between 3 and 5 . For these circuits , the clustering coe(cid:14)cients , the av - erage shortest - path lengths , and the degree distributions were obtained . In all the networks , the values of the aver - age shortest - path length were close to those for the corre - sponding classical random graphs with the same numbers of vertices and links . There was a wide diversity of val - ues of the clustering coe(cid:14)cients . However , all the large circuits considered in Ref . [ 128 ] ( N > 10 4 ) have cluster - ing coe(cid:14)cients that exceed those for the corresponding 14 classical random graphs by more than one order of mag - nitude . The most interesting results were obtained for the de - gree distributions which were found to have power - law tails . The degree distributions of the two largest digi - tal circuits were (cid:12)tted by power laws with the exponent (cid:13) (cid:25) 3 : 0 . Note that the maximal value of the number of connections of a component in these large circuits ap - proaches 10 2 . F . Other networks We have listed above only the most representative and well documented networks . Many kinds of friendship net - works may be added [ 17 , 18 , 28 ] . Polymers also form com - plex networks [ 129 { 131 ] . Even human sexual contacts were found to form a complex network . It was recently discovered [ 132 ] that this marvelous web is scale - free un - like friendship networks [ 28 ] which are exponential . One can introduce a call graph generated by long dis - tance telephone calls taken over some time interval [ 32 ] . Vertices of this network are telephone numbers , and the directed links are completed phone calls ( the direction is determined by the initiator of the talk ) . In Ref . [ 32 ] , calls made in a typical day were collected , and the net - work consisting of 47 (cid:2) 10 6 nodes was constructed ( note , however , that this network was probably generated and not obtained from empirical data ) . It was impossible to (cid:12)t P ( k o ) by any power - law dependence but the (cid:12)tting of the in - degree distribution P ( k i ) gave (cid:13) i (cid:25) 2 : 1 . The size of the giant connected component is of the order of the network size , and all others connected components are of the order of the logarithm of this size or smaller . The distribution of the sizes of connected components was measured but it was hard to make any conclusion about its functional form . Basic data for all networks , in which power - law degree distributions were observed , are summarized in Table I and Fig . 24 . For each such network , the total numbers of vertices and edges , and the degree distribution expo - nent are presented ( see discussion of scale - free networks in Sec . IX ) . We (cid:12)nish our incomplete list with a power grid of the Western States Power Grid [ 11 , 12 , 28 ] ( its vertices are transformers , substations , and generators , and edges are high - voltage transmission lines ) . The number of vertices in this undirected graph is 4 941 , and the average de - gree k is 2 : 67 . The average shortest - path length equals 18 : 7 . The clustering coe(cid:14)cient of the power grid is much greater than for the corresponding classical random net - work , C = 0 : 08 (cid:29) 2 : 67 = 4941 (cid:24) 0 : 0005 [ 11 , 12 ] . The degree distribution of the network is exponential [ 28 ] . VI . CLASSICAL RANDOM GRAPHS , THE ERD(cid:127)OS - R(cid:19)ENYI MODEL The simplest and most studied network with undi - rected edges was introduced by Erd(cid:127)os and R(cid:19)enyi ( ER model ) [ 77 , 78 ] . In this network : ( i ) the total number of vertices , N , is (cid:12)xed ; ( ii ) the probability that two arbitrary vertices are con - nected equals p . One sees that , on average , the network contains pN ( N (cid:0) 1 ) = 2 edges . The degree distribution is binomial , P ( k ) = (cid:18) N (cid:0) 1 k (cid:19) p k ( 1 (cid:0) p ) N (cid:0) 1 (cid:0) k ; ( 4 ) so the average degree is k = p ( N (cid:0) 1 ) . For large N , the distribution , Eq . ( 4 ) takes the Poisson form , P ( k ) = e (cid:0) k k k = k ! : ( 5 ) Therefore , the distribution rapidly decreases at large de - grees . Such distributions are characteristic for classical random networks . Moreover , in the mathematical liter - ature , the term \ random graph " usually means just the network with a Poisson degree distribution and statis - tically uncorrelated vertices . Here , we prefer to call it \ classical random graph " . We have already presented the estimate for an average shortest - path length of this network , ‘ (cid:24) ln N = ln [ pN ] . At small values of p , the system consists of small clus - ters . At large N and large enough p , the giant con - nected component appears in the network . The perco - lation threshold is p c (cid:24) = 1 = N , that is , k c = 1 . In fact , the ER model describes percolation on a lat - tice of in(cid:12)nite dimension , and the adequate mean - (cid:12)eld description is possible . VII . SMALL - WORLD NETWORKS In Sec . III B , we explained that random networks usu - ally show the so - called small - world e(cid:11)ect , i . e . , their av - erage shortest - path length is small . Then , in principle , it is natural to call them small - world networks . Watts and Strogatz [ 11 ] noticed the following important fea - ture of numerous networks in Nature . Although the av - erage shortest - path length between their vertices is really small and is of the order of the logarithm of their size , the clustering coe(cid:14)cient is much greater that it should be for classical random graphs . They proposed a model ( the WS model ) that demonstrates such a possibility and also called it the small - world network . The model be - longs to the class of networks displaying a crossover from ordered to random structures and may be treated ana - lytically . By de(cid:12)nition of Watts and Strogatz , the small - world networks are those with \ small " average shortest - path lengths and \ large " clustering coe(cid:14)cients . 15 This de(cid:12)nition seems a bit controversial . ( i ) According to it , numerous random networks with a small clustering coe(cid:14)cient are not small - world networks although they display the small - world e(cid:11)ect . ( ii ) If one starts from a 1D lattice with interaction only between the nearest neigh - bors , or from simple square or cubic lattices , the initial clustering coe(cid:14)cient is zero and it stays small during the procedure proposed by Watts and Strogatz although the network evidently belongs to the same class of nets as the WS model . In addition , as we will show , the class of net - works proposed by Watts and Strogatz provides only a particular possibility to get such a combination of the av - erage shortest - path length and the clustering coe(cid:14)cient ( see Sec . VII C ) . Irrespective of the consistency of the de(cid:12)nition of the small - world networks [ 11 , 12 ] and its relation with real networks , the proposed type of networks is very inter - esting . In fact , the networks introduced by Watts and Strogatz have an important generic feature { they are constructed from ordered lattices by random rewiring of edges or by addition of connections between random ver - tices . In the present section , we consider mainly networks of such kind . A . The Watts - Strogatz model and its variations The original network of Watts and Strogatz is con - structed in the following way ( see Fig . 10 , a ) . Initially , a regular one dimensional lattice with periodical bound - ary conditions is present . Each of L vertices has z (cid:21) 4 nearest neighbors ( z = 2 was not appropriate for Watts and Strogatz since , in this case , the clustering coe(cid:14)cient of the original regular lattice is zero ) . Then one takes all the edges of the lattice in turn and with probability p rewires to randomly chosen vertices . In such a way , a number of far connections appears . Obviously , when p is small , the situation has to be close to the original reg - ular lattice . For large enough p , the network is similar to the classical random graph . Note that the periodical boundary conditions are not essential . a ) rewiring of links b ) addition of links FIG . 10 . Small - world networks in which the crossover from a regular lattice to a random network is realized . ( a ) The original Watts - Strogatz model with the rewiring of links [ 11 ] . ( b ) The network with the addition of shortcuts [ 133 , 134 ] . Watts and Strogatz studied the crossover between these two limits . The main interest was in the average shortest path , ‘ , and the clustering coe(cid:14)cient ( recall that each edge has unit length ) . The simple but exciting re - sult was the following . Even for the small probability of rewiring , when the local properties of the network are still nearly the same as for the original regular lattice and the clustering coe(cid:14)cient does not di(cid:11)er essentially from its initial value , the average shortest - path length is al - ready of the order of the one for classical random graphs ( see Fig . 11 ) . −4 −3 −2 −1 0 0 . 5 1 0 log p l ( p ) / l ( 0 ) , C ( p ) / C ( 0 ) 10 16 FIG . 11 . Average shortest - path length ‘ and clustering coe(cid:14)cient C of the Watts - Strogatz model vs . fraction of the rewired links p [ 11 ] . Both are normalized to their values for the original regular lattice ( p = 0 ) . The network has 1000 nodes . The average number of the nearest neighbors equals 10 . C is practically constant in the range where ‘ sharply diminishes . This result seems quite natural . Indeed , the average shortest - path length is very sensitive to the short - cuts . One can see , that it is enough to make a few random rewirings to decrease ‘ by several times . On the other hand , several rewired edges cannot crucially change the local properties of the entire network . This means that the global properties of the network change strongly al - ready at pzL (cid:24) 1 , when there is one shortcut in the net - work , i . e . , at p (cid:24) 1 = ( Lz ) , when the local characteristics are still close to the regular lattice . Recall that the simplest local characteristic of nets is degree . Hence , it would be natural to compare , at (cid:12)rst , the behavior of ‘ and k . However , in the originally for - mulated WS model , k is independent on p since the total number of edges is conserved during the rewiring . Watts and Strogatz took another characteristic for comparison { the characteristic of the closest environment of a vertex , i . e . , the clustering coe(cid:14)cient C . Using the rewiring procedure , a network with a small average shortest - path length and a large clustering coef - (cid:12)cient was constructed . Instead of the rewiring of edges , one can add shortcuts to a regular lattice ( see Fig . 10 , b ) [ 93 , 133 { 135 ] . The main features of the model do not change . One can also start with a regular lattice of an ar - bitrary dimension d where the number of vertices N = L d [ 136 , 137 ] . In this case , the number of edges in the regular lattice is zL d = 2 . To keep the correspondence to the WS model , let us de(cid:12)ne p in such a way that for p = 1 , zL d = 2 random shortcuts are added . Then , the average number of shortcuts in the network is N s = pzL d = 2 . At small N s , we have two natural lengths in the system , ‘ and L , since the lattice spacing is not important in this regime . Their dimensionless ratio can be only a function of N s , ‘ L = f ( 2 N s ) = f ( pzL d ) ; ( 6 ) where f ( 0 ) (cid:24) 1 for the original regular lattice and f ( x (cid:29) 1 ) (cid:24) ln x = x 1 = d . From Eq . ( 6 ) , one can immediately ob - tain the following relation , ‘ ( pz ) 1 = d = g ( L ( pz ) 1 = d ) . Here , (cid:24) = ( pz ) (cid:0) 1 = d has the meaning of a length : N s (cid:24) d (cid:24) L d , it is the average distance between the closest end points of shortcuts measured on the regular lattice . In fact , one must study the limit L ! 1 , p ! 0 , as the number of shortcuts N s = pzL d = 2 is (cid:12)xed . The last relation for ‘ , in the case d = 1 , was proposed and studied by simulation in Ref . [ 138 ] and afterwards analytically [ 139 , 140 ] . The WS model and its variations seem exactly solv - able . Nevertheless , the only known exact result for the WS model is its degree distribution . It was found to be a rapidly decreasing function of a Poisson kind [ 140 ] . The exact form of the shortest - path length distributions has been found only for the simplest model in this class [ 141 ] , see Sec . VII B . 0 . 5 1 0−1 0 1 2 3 l z / L log ( pzL ) 10 FIG . 12 . Scaling of the average shortest - path length of \ small - world " networks [ 134 ] . The combination ‘z = L vs . pzL for the network constructed by the addition of random short - cuts to a one - dimensional lattice of the size L with the coor - dination number z . Many e(cid:11)orts were directed to the calculation of the scaling function f ( x ) describing the crossover between two limiting regimes [ 133 { 135 , 139 , 140 , 142 { 146 ] . As we have already explained , the average shortest - path length rapidly decreases to values characteristic for classical ran - dom networks as p grows . Therefore , it is convenient to plot f ( x ) in log - linear scales ( see Fig . 12 ) . One may study the distribution of diseases on such networks [ 147 ] . In Fig . 13 , a portion of \ infected " nodes , n i = L , in the network is shown vs . time passed after some vertex was infected [ 135 ] . At each time step , all the near - est neighbors of each infected vertex fall ill . At short times , n i = L / t d but then , at longer times , it increases exponentially until the saturation at the level n i = L = 1 . 17 0 . 5 1 0 0 4 8 n / L i t FIG . 13 .

It is possible to consider various problems for these networks [ 140 , 148 { 162 ] . In Refs . [ 147 , 163 ] , percolation in them was studied ( for in(cid:12)nitely large networks ) . Dif - fusion in the WS model and other related nets was con - sidered in [ 164 ] . It is easy to generalize the procedure of rewiring or addition of edges . In Refs . [ 136 , 137 ] , the following proce - dure was introduced . New edges between pairs of vertices of a regular d - dimensional lattice are added with proba - bility p ( r ) , where r is the Euclidean distance between the pair of vertices . If , e . g . , p ( r ) / exp ( (cid:0) const r ) , one gets a disordered d - dimensional lattice . Much slowly decreas - ing functions produce the small - world e(cid:11)ect and related phenomena . In Refs . [ 136 , 137 ] , one may (cid:12)nd the study of di(cid:11)usion on a (cid:12)nite size network in the case of a power - law dependence of this probability , p ( r ) / r (cid:0) (cid:15) . B . The smallest - world network Let us demonstrate the phenomena , which we discuss in the present section , using a trivial exactly solvable ex - ample , \ the smallest - world network " ( see Fig . 14 ) [ 141 ] . We start from L vertices connected in a ring by L links of unit length , that is , the coordination number z equals 2 and the clustering coe(cid:14)cient is zero . This is not essential for us since we have no intention to discuss its behavior ( in such a case , instead of the clustering coe(cid:14)cient , one may consider the density of linkage or degree ) . Then , we add a central vertex and make shortcuts between it and each other vertex with probability p . One may as - sume that lengths of these additional edges equal 1 = 2 . In fact , with probability p , we select random vertices and afterwards connect all of them together by edges of unit length . For the initial lattice , ‘ ( p = 0 ) = L = 4 , and , for the completely connected one , ‘ ( p = 1 ) = 1 . One should note that such networks may be rather reasonable in our world where substantial number of connections occurs through common centers ( see Fig . 15 ) . L−1 0 FIG . 14 . The \ smallest - world " network [ 141 ] . L vertices on the circle are connected by unit length edges . Each of these vertices is connected to the central one by a half - length edge with probability p . FIG . 15 . The real \ smallest - world " network . Unsociable inhabitants live in this village . Usually , they contact only with their neighbors but some of them attend the church . . . One may calculate the distribution P ( ‘ ) of the shortest - path lengths ‘ of the network exactly [ 141 ] . In the scaling limit , L ! 1 and p ! 0 , while the quantities (cid:26) (cid:17) pL ( average number of added edges ) and z (cid:17) ‘ = L are (cid:12)xed , the distribution takes the form , LP ( ‘ ; p ) (cid:17) Q ( z ; (cid:26) ) = 2 [ 1 + 2 (cid:26)z + 2 (cid:26) 2 z ( 1 (cid:0) 2 z ) ] e (cid:0) 2 (cid:26)z : ( 7 ) This distribution is shown in Fig . 16 . The correspond - ing average shortest - path length between pairs of vertices equals ‘ L (cid:17) z = 1 2 (cid:26) 2 [ 2 (cid:26) (cid:0) 3 + ( (cid:26) + 3 ) e (cid:0) (cid:26) ] ; ( 8 ) 18 that is just the scaling function f ( x ) discussed in Sec . VII A ( see Fig . 17 ) . Hence , z ( (cid:26) = 0 ) = 1 = 4 and z ( (cid:26) (cid:29) 1 ) ! 1 = (cid:26) , i . e . , ‘ ! 1 = p . One may also obtain the average shortest - path length h ‘ i ( k ) between two vertices of the network separated by the \ Euclidean " distance k , k = L (cid:17) x . In the scaling limit , we have h ‘ i ( k ; p ) L (cid:17) h z i ( x ) = 1 (cid:26) (cid:2) 1 (cid:0) ( 1 + (cid:26)x ) e (cid:0) 2 (cid:26)x (cid:3) ; ( 9 ) ( see Fig . 18 ) .

( 7 ) { ( 9 ) actually demonstrate the main features of the crossover phenomenon in the models under discussion although our toy model does not approach the classical random network at large p . ‘ of the model already dimin - ishes sharply in the range of (cid:26) where local properties of the network are nearly the same as of the initial regular structure . In Ref . [ 165 ] , one can (cid:12)nd the generalization of this model { the probability that a vertex is connected to the center is assumed to be dependent on the state of its closest environment . 19 C . Other possibilities to obtain large clustering coe(cid:14)cient The (cid:12)rst aim of Watts and Strogatz [ 11 ] was to con - struct networks with small average shortest paths and relatively large clustering coe(cid:14)cients which can mimic the corresponding behavior of real networks . In their network , the number of vertices is (cid:12)xed , and only edges are updated ( or are added ) . At least most of known net - works do not grow like this . Let us demonstrate a simple network with a similar combination of these parameters ( ‘ and C ) but evolving in a di(cid:11)erent way { the growth of the network is due to both addition of new vertices and addition of new edges . In this model , initially , there are three vertices con - nected by three undirected edges ( see Fig . 19 ) . Let at each time step , a new vertex be added . It connects to a randomly chosen triple of nearest neighbor vertices of the network . This procedure provides a network display - ing the small - world e(cid:11)ect . We will show below that this is a network with preferential linking . Its power - law de - gree distribution can be calculated exactly [ 166 ] ( see Sec . IX C ) . FIG . 19 . A simple growing network with a large cluster - ing coe(cid:14)cient . In the initial con(cid:12)guration , three vertices are present . At each time step , a new vertex with three edges is added . These edges are attached to randomly chosen triples of nearest neighbor vertices . At the moment , we are interested only in the cluster - ing coe(cid:14)cient . Initially , C = 1 ( see Fig . 19 , a ) . Let us estimate its value for the large network . One can see that the number of triangles of edges in the network increases by three each time a vertex is added . Simultaneously , the number of triples of connected vertices increases by the sum of degrees of all three vertices to which the new ver - tex is connected . This sum may be estimated as 3 k . Here , k = 2 ( 3 t ) = t = 6 . Hence , using the de(cid:12)nition of the clus - tering coe(cid:14)cient , we get C (cid:25) 3 ( 3 t ) = ( 3 kt ) = 3 = k = 1 = 2 . Therefore , C is much larger than the characteristic value k = t for classical random graphs , and this simple network , constructed in a quite di(cid:11)erent way than the WS model , shows both discussed features of many real networks ( see also the model with very similar properties in Sec . IX C , Fig . 21 ) . The reason for such a large value of the clus - tering coe(cid:14)cient is the simultaneous connection of a new vertex to nearest neighboring old vertices . This can par - tially explain the abundance of networks with large clus - tering coe(cid:14)cient in Nature . Indeed , the growth process , in which some old nearest neighbors connect together to a new vertex , that is , together \ borne " it , seems quite natural ( see Ref . [ 103 ] ) . Another possibility to obtain a large clustering coe(cid:14) - cient in a growing network is connecting a new vertex to several of its immediate predecessors with high probabil - ity ( see also models proposed in Refs . [ 167 , 168 ] ) . We should add that the one - mode projections of bipar - tite random graphs also have large clustering coe(cid:14)cients ( see Secs . V B and XI A ) . VIII . GROWING EXPONENTIAL NETWORKS The classical random network considered in Sec . VI has (cid:12)xed number of vertices . Let us discuss the simplest random network in which the number of vertices grows [ 55 , 56 ] . At each increment of time , let a new vertex be added to the network . It connects to a randomly cho - sen ( i . e . , without any preference ) old vertex ( see Fig . 2 ) . Let connections be undirected , although it is inessential here . The growth begins from the con(cid:12)guration consist - ing of two connected vertices at time t = 1 , so , at time t , the network consists of t + 1 vertices and t edges . The total degree equals 2 t . One can check that the average shortest - path length in this network is ‘ (cid:24) ln t like in classical random graphs . It is easy to obtain the degree distribution for such a net . We may label vertices by their birth times , s = 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; t . Let us introduce the probability , p ( k ; s ; t ) , that a vertex s has degree k at time t . The master equa - tion describing the evolution of the degree distribution of individual vertices is p ( k ; s ; t + 1 ) = 1 t + 1 p ( k (cid:0) 1 ; s ; t ) + (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 1 t + 1 (cid:19) p ( k ; s ; t ) ; ( 10 ) p ( k ; s = 0 ; 1 ; t = 1 ) = (cid:14) k ; 1 , (cid:14) ( k ; s = t ; t (cid:21) 1 ) = (cid:14) k ; 1 . This accounts for two possibilities for a vertex s . ( i ) With probability 1 = ( t + 1 ) , it may get an extra edge from the new vertex and increase its own degree by 1 . ( ii ) With the complimentary probability 1 (cid:0) 1 = ( t + 1 ) the vertex s may remain in the former state with the former degree . Notice that the second condition above makes Eq . ( 10 ) non - trivial . The total degree distribution of the entire network is P ( k ; t ) = 1 t + 1 t X s = 0 p ( k ; s ; t ) : ( 11 ) Using this de(cid:12)nition and applying P ts = 0 to both sides of Eq . ( 10 ) , we get the following master equation for the total degree distribution , ( t + 1 ) P ( k ; t + 1 ) (cid:0) tP ( k ; t ) = P ( k (cid:0) 1 ; t ) (cid:0) P ( k ; t ) + (cid:14) k ; 1 : ( 12 ) The corresponding stationary equation , i . e . , at t ! 1 , takes the form 20 2 P ( k ) (cid:0) P ( k (cid:0) 1 ) = (cid:14) k ; 1 ( 13 ) ( note that the stationary degree distribution P ( k ) (cid:17) P ( k ; t ! 1 ) exists ) . It has the solution of an expo - nential form , P ( k ) = 2 (cid:0) k : ( 14 ) Therefore , networks of such a type often are called \ expo - nential " . This form di(cid:11)ers from the Poisson degree distri - bution of classical random graphs , see Sec . VI . Neverthe - less , both distributions are rapidly decreasing functions , unlike degree distributions of numerous large networks in Nature . The average degree of vertex s at time t is k ( s ; t ) = 1 X k = 1 p ( k ; s ; t ) : ( 15 ) Applying P 1 k = 1 k to both sides of Eq . ( 10 ) , we get the equation for this quantity , k ( s ; t + 1 ) = k ( s ; t ) + 1 t + 1 : ( 16 ) The resulting average degree of individual vertices equals k ( s ; t ) = 1 + t (cid:0) s X j = 1 1 s + j = 1 + ( t + 1 ) (cid:0) ( s + 1 ) ( 17 ) [ k ( 0 ; t ) = k ( 1 ; t ) ] . Here , ( ) is the - function , i . e . the logarithmic derivative of the gamma - function . For s ; t (cid:29) 1 , we obtain the asymptotic form , k ( s ; t ) = 1 (cid:0) ln ( s = t ) ; ( 18 ) i . e . , the average degree of individual vertices of this net - work weakly diverges in the region of the oldest vertex . Hence , the oldest vertex is the \ richest " ( of course , in the statistical sense , i . e . , with high probability ) . From Eq . ( 10 ) , one can also (cid:12)nd the degree distribu - tion of individual vertices , p ( k ; s ; t ) , for large s and t and (cid:12)xed s = t , p ( k ; s ; t ) = s t 1 ( k + 1 ) ! ln k + 1 (cid:18) t s (cid:19) : ( 19 ) One sees that this function decreases rapidly at large val - ues of degree k . Similar results may be easily obtained for a network in which each new vertex has not one , as previously , but any (cid:12)xed number of connections with randomly chosen old vertices . In fact , all the results of the present section are typical for growing exponential networks . IX . SCALE - FREE NETWORKS As we saw in Sec . V , at least several important large growing networks in Nature are scale - free , i . e . , their de - gree distributions are of a power - law form ( nevertheless , look at the remark in Sec . V C 2 concerning the qual - ity of the experimental material ) . The natural question is how they self - organize into scale - free structures while growing . What is the mechanism responsible for such self - organization ? For explanation of these phenomena , the idea of preferential linking ( preferential attachment of edges to vertices ) has been proposed [ 55 , 56 ] . A . Barab(cid:19)asi - Albert model and the idea of preferential linking We have demonstrated in Sec . VIII that if new connec - tions in a growing network appear between vertices cho - sen without any preference , e . g . , between new vertices and randomly chosen old ones , the degree distribution is exponential . Nevertheless , in real networks , linking is very often preferential . For example , when you make a new reference in your own page , the probability that you refer to a popular Web document is certainly higher than the probability that this reference is to some poorly known document to that nobody referred before you . Therefore , popular vertices with high number of links are more attractive for new connections than vertices with few links { popularity is attractive . Let us demonstrate the growth of a network with preferential linking using , as the simplest example , the Barab(cid:19)asi - Albert model ( the BA model ) [ 55 ] . We return to the model described in Sec . VIII ( see Fig . 2 ) and change in it only one aspect . Now a new vertex connects not to a randomly chosen old vertex but to a vertex cho - sen preferentially . We describe here the simplest situation : The probabil - ity that the edge is attached to an old vertex is propor - tional to the degree of this old vertex , i . e . , to the total number of its connections . At time t , the total number of edges is t , and the total degree equals 2 t . Hence , this probability equals k = ( 2 t ) . One should emphasize that this is only a particular form of a preference function . However , just the linear type of the preference was in - dicated in several real networks [ 15 , 15 ] ( see discussion is Secs . V A , V B and V C 1 ) . To account for the pref - erential linking , we must make obvious modi(cid:12)cations to the master equation , Eq . ( 10 ) . For the BA model , the master equation takes the following form , p ( k ; s ; t + 1 ) = k (cid:0) 1 2 t p ( k (cid:0) 1 ; s ; t ) + (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) k 2 t (cid:19) p ( k ; s ; t ) ( 20 ) with the initial condition p ( k ; s = 0 ; 1 ; t = 1 ) = (cid:14) k ; 1 and the boundary one p ( k ; t ; t ) = (cid:14) k ; 1 . From Eqs . ( 11 ) and 21 ( 20 ) , we get the master equation for the total degree dis - tribution , ( t + 1 ) P ( k ; t + 1 ) (cid:0) tP ( k ; t ) = 1 2 [ ( k (cid:0) 1 ) P ( k (cid:0) 1 ; t ) (cid:0) kP ( k ; t ) ] + (cid:14) k ; 1 ; ( 21 ) and , in the limit t ! 1 , the equation for the stationary distribution , P ( k ) + 1 2 [ kP ( k ) (cid:0) ( k (cid:0) 1 ) P ( k (cid:0) 1 ) ] = (cid:14) k ; 1 : ( 22 ) In the continuum k limit , this equation is of the form P ( k ) + ( 1 = 2 ) d [ kP ( k ) ] = dk = 0 . The solution of the last equation is P ( k ) / k (cid:0) 3 . Thus , the preferential linking of the form that we consider provides a scale - free network , and the (cid:13) exponent of its distribution equals 3 [ 55 { 57 ] . This value is exact , see Ref . [ 94 , 169 ] and the discussion below . We emphasize that the preferential linking mechanism [ 55 , 56 ] ( 1999 ) is the basic idea of the modern theory of evolving networks . Notice that preferential attachment may also arise e(cid:11)ectively , in an indirect way ( e . g . , see Sec . IX C and models from Refs . [ 167 , 168 , 170 ] ) . The re - cent empirical data [ 15 , 101 , 103 ] ( see Secs . V A , V B , and V C ) on the dynamics of the attachment of new edges in various growing networks provide support for this mech - anism . B . Master equation approach The master equation approach [ 169 ] is very e(cid:14)cient for problems of the network evolution . Indeed , the linear discrete di(cid:11)erence equations that arise ( usually of (cid:12)rst order ) can be easily solved , e . g . , using Z - transform . Let us describe the degree distributions for networks with preferential linking of a more general type than in Sec . IX A . m new node old net FIG . 20 . Scheme of the growth of the basic directed net - work under preferential linking mechanism . At each time step a new vertex and m directed edges are added . Their source ends may be anywhere . The target ends of these edges are attached to vertices of the network according to the rule of preferential linking . Let us consider the following network with directed edges ( see Fig . 20 ) . We will discuss here the in - degree distribution , so that we use , for brevity , the notations q ( s ; t ) (cid:17) k i ( s ; t ) and (cid:13) instead (cid:13) i . ( i ) At each time step , a new vertex is added to the network . ( ii ) Simultaneously , m new directed edges going out of non - speci(cid:12)ed vertices or even from the outside of the network appeared . ( iii ) Target ends of the new edges are distributed among vertices according to the following rule . The prob - ability that a new edge points to some vertex s is pro - portional to q ( s ) + A . The parameter A (cid:17) ma plays the role of additional attractiveness of vertices . The resulting in - degree distri - bution does not depend on the place from which new edges go out . If , in particular , each new vertex is the source of all the m new edges ( see a citation graph in Fig . 2 ) , then k ( s ; t ) = q ( s ; t ) + m , and the degree of each vertex is (cid:12)xed by its in - degree . If , in addition , we set A = m , i . e . , a = 1 , then new edges are distributed with probability proportional to k ( s ; t ) , and we come to the BA model . Let us discuss the general case . The structure of the master equation for the in - degree distribution of individ - ual vertices , p ( q ; s ; t ) , may be understood from the follow - ing . The probability that a new edge comes to a vertex s equals [ q ( s ; t ) + am ] = [ ( 1 + a ) mt ] . Here , a (cid:17) A = m . The probability that a vertex s receives exactly l new edges of the m injected is P ( ml ) s = (cid:18) m l (cid:19)(cid:20) q ( s ; t ) + am ( 1 + a ) mt (cid:21) l (cid:20) 1 (cid:0) q ( s ; t ) + am ( 1 + a ) mt (cid:21) m (cid:0) l : ( 23 ) Hence , the in - degree distribution of an individual ver - tex of the large network under consideration obeys the following master equation , p ( q ; s ; t + 1 ) = m X l = 0 P ( ml ) s p ( q (cid:0) l ; s ; t ) = m X l = 0 (cid:18) m l (cid:19)(cid:20) q (cid:0) l + am ( 1 + a ) mt (cid:21) l (cid:20) 1 (cid:0) q (cid:0) l + am ( 1 + a ) mt (cid:21) m (cid:0) l p ( q (cid:0) l ; s ; t ) : ( 24 ) Vertices of this simple network are born without incoming edges , so the boundary condition for this equation is 22 p ( q ; t ; t ) = (cid:14) q ; 0 , where (cid:14) i ; j is the Kronecker symbol . The initial condition is (cid:12)xed by the initial con(cid:12)guration of the network . Summing up Eq . ( 24 ) over s , at long times , one gets the di(cid:11)erence - di(cid:11)erential equation ( 1 + a ) t @ P @ t ( q ; t ) + ( 1 + a ) P ( q ; t ) + ( q + am ) P ( q ; t ) (cid:0) ( q (cid:0) 1 + am ) P ( q (cid:0) 1 ; t ) = ( 1 + a ) (cid:14) q ; 0 : ( 25 ) Excluding from it the term with the derivative , we obtain the equation for the stationary in - degree distribution P ( q ) = P ( q ; t ! 1 ) , that is , for the in - degree distribution of the in(cid:12)nitely large network . ( In fact , we have assumed that this stationary distribution exists . In the situation that we consider , this assumption is quite reasonable . ) One may check by direct substitution that the exact solution of the stationary equation is of the form [ 169 ] P ( q ) = ( 1 + a ) (cid:0) [ 1 + ( m + 1 ) a ] (cid:0) ( ma ) (cid:0) ( q + ma ) (cid:0) [ q + 2 + ( m + 1 ) a ] : ( 26 ) Here , (cid:0) ( ) is the gamma - function . In particular , when a = 1 , that corresponds to the BA model [ 55 ] , we get the expression P ( q ) = 2 m ( m + 1 ) ( q + m ) ( q + m + 1 ) ( q + m + 2 ) : ( 27 ) To get the degree distribution of the BA model , one has only to substitute the degree k instead of q + m into Eq . ( 27 ) . Hence the continuum approximation introduced in Sec . IX A indeed produced the proper value 3 of the exponent of this distribution . For q + ma (cid:29) 1 , the stationary distribution ( 26 ) takes the asymptotic form : P ( q ) / ( q + ma ) (cid:0) ( 2 + a ) : ( 28 ) Therefore , the scaling exponent (cid:13) of the distribution de - pends on the additional attractiveness in the following way : (cid:13) = 2 + a = 2 + A = m : ( 29 ) Since A > 0 , (cid:13) varies between 2 and 1 . This range of the (cid:13) exponent values is natural for networks with con - stant average degree . In such a case , the (cid:12)rst moment of the degree distribution must be (cid:12)nite , so that (cid:13) > 2 ( see discussion in Sec . IX J ) . For this network , one may also (cid:12)nd the in - degree distri - bution of individual vertices . At long times , the equation for it follows from Eq . ( 24 ) , p ( q ; s ; t + 1 ) = (cid:20) 1 (cid:0) q + am ( 1 + a ) t (cid:21) p ( q ; s ; t ) + q (cid:0) 1 + am ( 1 + a ) t p ( q (cid:0) 1 ; s ; t ) + O (cid:16) p t 2 (cid:17) : ( 30 ) Assuming that the scale of time variation is much larger than 1 , at long times ( large sizes of the network ) we can replace the (cid:12)nite t - di(cid:11)erence with a derivative : ( 1 + a ) t @ p @ t ( q ; s ; t ) = ( q (cid:0) 1 + am ) p ( q (cid:0) 1 ; s ; t ) (cid:0) ( q + am ) p ( q ; s ; t ) : ( 31 ) The solution of Eq . ( 31 ) , i . e . , the in - degree distribution of individual vertices , is p ( q ; s ; t ) = (cid:0) ( am + q ) (cid:0) ( am ) q ! (cid:16) s t (cid:17) am = ( 1 + a ) (cid:20) 1 (cid:0) (cid:16) s t (cid:17) 1 = ( 1 + a ) (cid:21) q : ( 32 ) Hence , this distribution has an exponential tail . One may also get the expression for the average in - degree of a given vertex : q ( s ; t ) = 1 X q = 0 q p ( q ; s ; ) = a m (cid:20)(cid:16) s t (cid:17) (cid:0) 1 = ( 1 + a ) (cid:0) 1 (cid:21) : ( 33 ) Unlike a weak logarithmic divergence of average degree for oldest vertices of the exponential network ( see Eq . ( 18 ) ) , here , at (cid:12)xed time t , the average in - degree of an old vertex s (cid:28) t diverges as s (cid:0) (cid:12) , where the exponent (cid:12) = 1 = ( 1 + a ) . One sees that for the BA model , (cid:12) = 1 = 2 . The average degree of the oldest vertices is the highest , so the rule \ the oldest is the richest " is certainly ful - (cid:12)lled here . The singularity is strong , so the e(cid:11)ect is pronounced . From Eqs . ( 29 ) and ( 33 ) , we obtain the following relation between the exponents of the network [ 171 ] : (cid:12) ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) = 1 ; ( 34 ) We will show in Sec . IX D that the relation , Eq . ( 34 ) , is universal for scale - free networks and can be obtained 23 from the general considerations ( nevertheless , see discus - sion of a particular case of violation of this relation in Sec . IX K ) . In the scaling limit , when q ; s ; t ! 1 , s (cid:28) t , and the scaling variable (cid:24) (cid:17) q ( s = t ) (cid:12) is (cid:12)xed , the in - degree distribution , Eq . ( 32 ) , takes the form p ( q ; s ; t ) = (cid:16) s t (cid:17) (cid:12) f (cid:20) q (cid:16) s t (cid:17) (cid:12) (cid:21) ; ( 35 ) where the scaling function is f ( (cid:24) ) = 1 (cid:0) ( am ) (cid:24) am (cid:0) 1 exp ( (cid:0) (cid:24) ) : ( 36 ) Note that a particular form of the scaling function is model - dependent . C . A simple model of scale - free networks The results of Secs . IX A and IX B were obtained for large networks . Let us discuss a simple scale - free growing net for which exact answers may be obtained for an arbi - trary size , without passing to the limit of large networks [ 166 ] . a ) c ) d ) b ) t = 2 t = 3 t = 4 t = 5 2 3 4 1 0 0 4 2 3 3 2 2 0 1 1 0 5 1 FIG . 21 . Illustration of a simple model of a scale - free growing network [ 166 ] . In the initial con(cid:12)guration , t = 2 , three vertices are present , s = 0 ; 1 ; 2 ( a ) . At each increment of time , a new vertex with two edges is added . These edges are attached to the ends of a randomly chosen edge of the network . We introduce the growing network with undirected edges ( see Fig . 21 ) . Initially ( t = 2 ) , three vertices are present , s = 0 ; 1 ; 2 , each with degree 2 . ( i ) At each increment of time , a new vertex is added . ( ii ) It is connected to both ends of a randomly chosen edge by two undirected edges . The preferential linking arises in this simple model not because of some special rule including a function of vertex degree as in Refs . [ 55 , 169 ] but quite naturally . Indeed , in the model that we consider here , the probability that a vertex has a randomly chosen edge attached to it is equal to the ratio of the degree k of the vertex and the total number of edges , 2 t (cid:0) 1 . Therefore , the evolution of the network is described by the following master equation for the degree distribution of individual vertices , p ( k ; s ; t + 1 ) = k (cid:0) 1 2 t (cid:0) 1 p ( k (cid:0) 1 ; s ; t ) + 2 t (cid:0) 1 (cid:0) k 2 t (cid:0) 1 p ( k ; s ; t ) ; ( 37 ) with the initial condition , p ( k ; s = f 0 ; 1 ; 2 g ; t = 2 ) = (cid:14) k ; 2 . Also , p ( k ; t ; t ) = (cid:14) k ; 2 . This master equation and all the following ones in this subsection are exact for all t (cid:21) 2 . Eq . ( 37 ) has a form similar to that of the BA model , Eq . ( 20 ) . Therefore , the scaling exponents of these models have to coincide . From Eq . ( 37 ) , there follows a number of exact rela - tions for this model . In particular , from Eq . ( 37 ) , one may (cid:12)nd the equation for the average degree of an indi - vidual vertex , k ( s ; t ) (cid:17) P t (cid:0) s + 2 k = 2 kp ( k ; s ; t ) : k ( s ; t + 1 ) = 2 t 2 t (cid:0) 1 k ( s ; t ) ; k ( t ; t ) = 2 ( 38 ) with the following solution : k ( s ; t ) = 2 t (cid:0) s + 1 ( t (cid:0) 1 ) ! ( s (cid:0) 1 ) ! ( 2 s (cid:0) 3 ) ! ! ( 2 t (cid:0) 3 ) ! ! s ; t (cid:29) 1 (cid:24) = 2 r t s : ( 39 ) Here , s (cid:21) 2 and k ( 0 ; t ) = k ( 1 ; t ) = k ( 2 ; t ) . Hence , the scaling exponent (cid:12) , de(cid:12)ned through the relation k ( s ; t ) / ( s = t ) (cid:0) (cid:12) , equals 1 = 2 as for the BA model . The scaling form of p ( k ; s ; t ) for k ; s ; t (cid:29) 1 and k p s = t (cid:12)xed is p ( k ; s ; t ) = r s t (cid:18) k r s t (cid:19) exp (cid:18) (cid:0) k r s t (cid:19) : ( 40 ) ( compare with Eqs . ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) ) . The matter of interest is the total degree distribution , P ( k ; t ) (cid:17) P ts = 0 p ( k ; s ; t ) = ( t + 1 ) . The equation for it follows from Eq . ( 37 ) , P ( k ; t ) = t t + 1 (cid:20) k (cid:0) 1 2 t (cid:0) 3 P ( k (cid:0) 1 ; t (cid:0) 1 ) + (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) k 2 t (cid:0) 3 (cid:19) P ( k ; t (cid:0) 1 ) (cid:21) + 1 t + 1 (cid:14) k ; 2 ( 41 ) 24 with the initial condition P ( k ; 2 ) = (cid:14) k ; 2 . In the limit of the large network size , t ! 1 , P ( k ; t ) approaches a stationary degree distribution P ( k ) which is very similar to the degree distribution of the BA model , P ( k ) = 12 k ( k + 1 ) ( k + 2 ) ; ( 42 ) that is , (cid:13) = 3 . How does the degree distribution approach this sta - tionary limit ? We do not write down the cumbersome exact solution of Eq . ( 41 ) [ 166 ] but only write its scaling form for large k and long time t with k = p t (cid:12)xed : P ( k ; t ) = P ( k ) " 1 + 1 4 k 2 t + 1 8 (cid:18) k 2 t (cid:19) 2 # exp (cid:26) (cid:0) 1 4 k 2 t (cid:27) : ( 43 ) The factor P ( k ; t ) = P ( k ) (cid:17) g ( k = p t ) depends only on the combination k = p t . Therefore , the peculiarities of the distribution induced by the size e(cid:11)ects never disappear but only move with increasing time in the direction of large degree . The function g ( k = p t ) is shown in Fig . 22 . Thus , the power - law dependence of the degree dis - tribution of the (cid:12)nite size network is observable only in a rather narrow region , 1 (cid:28) k (cid:28) p t . The cut - o(cid:11) at k cut (cid:24) p t = t 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) and the hump impede observation of scale - free behavior . 0 2 4 6 k / t 1 / 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 P ( k , t ) / P ( k ) FIG . 22 . Deviation of the degree distribution of the (cid:12)nite - size network from the stationary one , P ( k ; t ) = P ( k ; t ! 1 ) , vs . k = p t . The form of the hump de - pends on the initial con(cid:12)guration of the network . One can check that the form of the hump in Fig . 22 de - pends on the initial conditions . In our case , the evolution starts from the con(cid:12)guration shown in Fig . 22 , a . If the growth starts from another con(cid:12)guration , the form of the hump will be di(cid:11)erent . Note that this trace of the initial conditions is visible at any size of the network . Similar humps ( or peaks ) at the cut - o(cid:11) position were also ob - served recently [ 172 ] in the non - stationary distributions of the Simon model [ 65 , 66 ] ( see Sec . XII B ) . In Sec . V C 2 we have mentioned a kind of bipartite sub - graphs ( bipartite cliques ) which are used for index - ing of cyber - communities in a large directed graph | the WWW . In such a bipartite sub - graph , all ha directed edges connecting h hubs to a authorities are present ( see Fig . 7 ) . One may easily check that in a large equilib - rium random graph the total number of these bipartite sub - graphs is negligible [ 173 ] . This is not the case for the growing networks . In the model under discussion , the statistics of the bipartite sub - graphs is very simple , so that we use this model as an illustrating example . Let us slightly modify the model to get a directed network . For this , let new edges be directed from new vertices to old ones . The possible number of author - ities in the bipartite subgraphs of our graph is (cid:12)xed : a = 2 . Each pair of nearest neighbor vertices plays the role of authorities of a bipartite sub - graph based on them . At each time step , a new hub ( a new vertex ) is added to a randomly chosen bipartite clique and two new cliques ( two new edges ) emerge . The total number N b ( h ; a = 2 ; t ) (cid:17) N b ( h ; t ) of bipartite sub - graphs with h hubs in the network in time t satisfy the following simple equation N b ( h ; t + 1 ) = 2 (cid:14) h ; 0 + N b ( h ; t ) + 1 t N b ( h (cid:0) 1 ; t ) (cid:0) 1 t N b ( h ; t ) : ( 44 ) The (cid:12)rst term on the right - hand part of Eq . ( 44 ) is a contribution from two new edges , the third and fourth terms are due to addition of a new hub , that is , a new vertex , to the network . The probability that a randomly chosen vertex be - longs to the bipartite sub - graphs with h hubs is G ( h ; t ) = N b ( h ; t ) = t . From Eq . ( 44 ) we have ( t + 1 ) G ( h ; t + 1 ) (cid:0) tG ( h ; t ) = 2 (cid:14) h ; 0 (cid:0) G ( h ; t ) + G ( h (cid:0) 1 ; t ) : ( 45 ) Its stationary solution G ( h ) (cid:17) G ( h ; t ! 1 ) is G ( h ) = 2 (cid:0) h . Hence , the total number of the bipartite sub - graphs with h hubs in the large network is large ( proportional to t ) and decreases exponentially as h grows : 25 N b ( h ; t ) = 2 (cid:0) h t : ( 46 ) This result agrees with an estimate made in Ref . [ 173 ] for citation graphs growing under mechanism of preferential linking and correlates with the measurements [ 90 , 91 ] of the distribution of the bipartite subgraphs in the WWW ( see Sec . V C 2 ) . Note that the above model is very close to the net - work growing under mechanism of linking to triples of the nearest neighbor nodes ( see Sec . VII C ) . The degree distributions of these networks are very similar ( (cid:13) = 3 ) . Both these scale - free networks have large clustering co - e(cid:14)cients . FIG . 23 . A simple deterministic growing graph . At time t = 0 , the graph is a triangle . At each time step every edge of the graph generates a new vertex which connects to both ends of the edge . One may slightly modify the model under considera - tion and obtain a deterministic growing graph which has a discrete spectrum of degrees . \ Scale - free " networks of this kind were recently proposed in Ref . [ 174 ] . At each time step , let every edge of the graph generate a new vertex which connects to both ends of the edge ( see Fig . 23 ) . The growth starts from a triangle ( t = 0 ) . Then the total number of vertices at time t is N t = 3 ( 3 t + 1 ) = 2 and the total number of edges is L t = 3 t + 1 , so that the average degree k t = 4 = ( 1 + 3 (cid:0) t ) approaches 4 in the large - graph limit . The \ perimeter " of the graph ( see Fig . 23 ) is P t = 3 (cid:2) 2 t , hence N t (cid:24) L t (cid:24) P ln3 = ln2 t when t is large . The clustering coe(cid:14)cient of the graph is large : C ! 4 = 5 as t ! 1 . The spectrum of degrees of the graph is dis - crete : at time t , the number n ( k ; t ) of vertices of degree k = 2 ; 2 2 ; 2 3 ; : : : ; 2 t (cid:0) 1 ; 2 t ; 2 t + 1 is equal to 3 t ; 3 t (cid:0) 1 ; 3 t (cid:0) 2 ; : : : ; 3 2 ; 3 ; 3 , respectively . Other values of degree are absent in the spectrum . Clearly , for the large network , n ( k ; t ) decreases as a power law of k , so the net - work may be called \ scale - free " . It is easy to introduce the exponent (cid:13) for this discrete situation where degree points are inhomogeneously spread over the k axis . For this one may calculate the corresponding cumulative dis - tribution P cum ( k j ) / k (cid:0) ln3 = ln 2 j / k 1 (cid:0) (cid:13) j . Here k j are points of the discrete degree spectrum . Then we obtain (cid:13) = 1 + ln 3 ln 2 > 2 : ( 47 ) Compare this expression with the exponent ( the fractal dimension ) in the relation between the \ mass " and the perimeter of the graph . Also , notice that the maximal degree of a vertex is k cut = 2 t + 1 (cid:24) N ln 2 = ln3 t = N 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) t . Other deterministic versions of the same simple model produce various discrete distributions ( exponential and others ) . D . Scaling relations and cuto(cid:11) In Secs . IX B and IX C we found that a number of quantities of particular scale - free networks may be writ - ten in a scaling form , and the scaling exponents involved are connected by a simple relation . Can these forms and relations be applied to all scale - free networks ? Let us proceed with general considerations . In this subsection , it is not essential , whether we consider de - gree , in - degree , or out - degree . Hence we use one general notation , k . When one speaks about scaling properties , a continuum treatment is su(cid:14)cient , so that we can use the following expressions P ( k ; t ) = 1 t Z t t 0 ds p ( k ; s ; t ) ( 48 ) and k ( s ; t ) = Z 1 0 dk kp ( k ; s ; t ) : ( 49 ) In addition , we will need the normalization condition for p ( k ; s ; t ) , Z 1 0 dk p ( k ; s ; t ) = 1 : ( 50 ) If the stationary distribution exists , than from Eq . ( 48 ) , it follows that p ( k ; s ; t ) has to be of the form p ( k ; s ; t ) = (cid:26) ( k ; s = t ) . From the normalization condi - tion , Eq . ( 50 ) , we get R 1 0 dk (cid:26) ( k ; x ) = 1 , so (cid:26) ( k ; x ) = g ( x ) f ( kg ( x ) ) , where g ( x ) and f ( x ) are arbitrary func - tions . Let us assume that the stationary distribution P ( k ) and the average degree k ( s ; t ) exhibit scaling behavior , that is , P ( k ) / k (cid:0) (cid:13) for large k and k ( s ; t ) / s (cid:0) (cid:12) for 1 (cid:28) s (cid:28) t . Then , from Eq . ( 49 ) , one sees that R 1 0 dk k(cid:26) ( k ; x ) / x (cid:0) (cid:12) . Substituting (cid:26) ( k ; x ) into this re - lation , one obtains g ( x ) / x (cid:12) . Of course , without loss of generality , one may set g ( x ) = x (cid:12) , so that we obtain the following scaling form of the degree distribution of individual vertices , p ( k ; s ; t ) = ( s = t ) (cid:12) f ( k ( s = t ) (cid:12) ) : ( 51 ) 26 Finally , assuming the scaling behavior of P ( k ) , i . e . , R 1 0 dx (cid:26) ( k ; x ) / k (cid:0) (cid:13) , and using Eq . ( 51 ) , we obtain (cid:13) = 1 + 1 = (cid:12) , i . e . , relation ( 34 ) between the exponents is universal for scale - free networks . Here we used the rapid convergence of (cid:26) ( k ; x ) at large x ( see Eqs . ( 36 ) and ( 40 ) ) . One should note that in this derivation we did not use any approximation . The relation between the (cid:13) and (cid:12) exponents looks pre - cisely the same as that for the (cid:13) exponent of the degree distribution and the corresponding exponent of Zipf’s law , (cid:23) . One can easily understand the reason of this coincidence . Recall that , in Zipf’s law , the following de - pendence is considered : k = f ( r ) . Here r is the rank of a vertex of the degree k , i . e . , r / R 1 k dk P ( k ) (cid:17) P cum ( k ) . If Zipf’s law is valid , k / r (cid:0) (cid:23) , then r / k (cid:0) 1 = (cid:23) / k (cid:0) (cid:13) + 1 , and we get (cid:13) = 1 + 1 = (cid:23) . Therefore , the (cid:12) exponent equals the exponent of the Zipf’s law , (cid:12) = (cid:23) . Now we can discuss the size - e(cid:11)ects in growing scale - free networks . Accounting for the rapid decrease of the function f ( z ) in Eq . ( 35 ) , one sees that the power - law dependence of the total degree distribution has a cut - o(cid:11) at the characteristic value , k cut (cid:24) t (cid:12) = t 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) : ( 52 ) In fact , k cut is the generic scale of all \ scale - free " net - works . It also follows from the condition t R 1 k cut dkP ( k ) (cid:24) 1 , i . e . , t R 1 k cut dkk (cid:0) (cid:13) (cid:24) 1 . This means that only one ver - tex in a network has degree above the cuto(cid:11) . A more precise estimate is k = k 0 (cid:24) t 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) , where k 0 is the lower boundary of the power - law region of the degree distribu - tion . Eq . ( 52 ) can be used to estimate the (cid:13) exponent if the maximal degree in a network is known from empirical data [ 94 , 95 ] . We have already applied Eq . ( 52 ) in Sec . V to check the quality of reported values of some real networks . We have shown ( see Sec . IX C ) that a trace of initial conditions at k (cid:24) k cut may be visible in a degree distribu - tion measured for any network size [ 166 ] . The cuto(cid:11) ( and the trace of initial conditions ) sets strong restrictions for observations of power - law distributions since there are few really large networks in Nature . In fact , measurement of degree distributions is always hindered by strong (cid:13)uctuations at large k . The reason of such (cid:13)uctuations is the poor statistics in this region . One can easily estimate the characteristic value of de - gree , k f , above which the (cid:13)uctuations are strong . If P ( k ) (cid:24) k (cid:0) (cid:13) , tk (cid:0) (cid:13) f (cid:24) 1 . Therefore , k f (cid:24) t 1 = (cid:13) . One may improve the situation using the cumulative distributions , P cum ( k ) (cid:17) R 1 k dkP ( k ) , instead of P ( k ) . Also , in simula - tions , one may make a lot of runs to improve the statis - tics . Nevertheless , one can not exceed the cut - o(cid:11) , k cut , that we discuss . This cut - o(cid:11) is the real barrier for the ob - servation of the power - law dependence . ( One should note that accounting for the aging of nodes , break of links , or disappearance of nodes suppresses the e(cid:11)ect of the initial conditions and removes the hump [ 171 , 175 , 176 ] . ) No scale - free networks with large values of (cid:13) were ob - served . The reason for this is clear . Indeed , the power - law dependence of the degree distribution can be ob - served only if it exists for at least 2 or 3 decades of degree . For this , the networks have to be large : their size should be , at least , t > 10 2 : 5 ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) . Then , if (cid:13) is large , one prac - tically has no chances to (cid:12)nd the scale - free behavior . In Fig . 24 , in the log - linear scale , we present the val - ues of the (cid:13) exponents of all the networks reported as having power - law degree distributions vs . their sizes ( see also Tab . I ) . One sees that almost all the plotted points are inside of the region restricted by the lines : (cid:13) = 2 , log 10 t (cid:24) 2 : 5 ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) , and by the logarithm of the size of the largest scale - free network { the World - Wide Web { log 10 t (cid:24) 9 . In a similar way , we obtain the following general form of P ( k ; t ) for scale - free networks in the scaling regime : P ( k ; t ) = k (cid:0) (cid:13) F ( kt (cid:0) (cid:12) ) = k (cid:0) (cid:13) F ( kt (cid:0) 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) ) : ( 53 ) Here F ( x ) is a scaling function . We have obtained this form for an exactly solvable network in Sec .

Sizes and values of the (cid:13) exponent of the networks or subgraphs reported as having power - law ( in - , out - ) degree distributions . For each network ( or class of networks ) data are presented in more or less historical order , so that the recent exciting progress is visible . Errors are not shown ( see the caption of Fig . 24 ) . They depend on the size of a network and on the value of (cid:13) . We recommend our readers to look at the remark at the end of Sec . V C2 before using these values . 1 The data for the network of operating AS was obtained for one of days in December 1999 . 2 The value of the (cid:13) exponent was estimated from the degree distribution plot in Ref . [ 104 ] . 3 The network of protein - protein interaction is treated as undirected . 4 The value of the (cid:13) exponent for the word web is given for the range of degrees below the crossover point ( see Fig . 9 ) . 5 The out - degree distribution of the telephone call graph cannot be (cid:12)tted by a power - law dependence ( notice the remark in Sec . VF ) . 6 In fact , the data was collected from a small set of vertices of the web of human sexual contacts . These vertices almost surely have no connections between them . 7 These food webs are truly small . In Refs . [ 50 , 51 ] degree distributions of such food webs were interpreted as exponential - like . 28 2 . 5 3 2 3a’ g 3 . 5 2 4 6 8 log ( size ) 10 1 . 5 1i 1o 1o’’ 1o’ 1i’’’ 2 3’ 4i4i’ 4i’’ 4j 4j’ 4j’’ 5a’ 5b 5b’’5a 5b’ 4j’’’ 6io 7 3 8 9 10 11 1i’ FIG . 24 .

The line (cid:13) (cid:24) 1 + log 10 t = 2 : 5 is the estimate of the (cid:12)nite - size boundary for the observation of the power - law degree distributions for (cid:13) > 2 . Here 2 : 5 is the range of degrees ( orders ) which we believe is necessary to observe a power law . The dashed line , (cid:13) = 3 , is the resilience boundary ( see Sec . XID ) . This boundary is important for networks which must be stable to random breakdowns . The points are plotted using the data from Tab . I . Points for (cid:13) o and (cid:13) i from the same set of data are connected . The precision of the right points is about (cid:6) 0 : 1 ( ? ) and is much worse for points in the grey region . There exists a chance that some of these nets are actually not in the class of scale - free networks .

Continuum approach As we have already seen in Sec . IX A , the continuum approximation produces the exact value of (cid:13) for the BA model . The (cid:12)rst results for the exponents [ 55 ] were ob - tained just using this approximation ( in Refs . [ 55 , 56 ] it was called \ mean (cid:12)eld " ) . Such an approach gives the ex - act values of the exponents for numerous models of grow - ing scale - free networks and allows us to describe easily main features of the network growth [ 171 , 175 ] . Let us brie(cid:13)y describe this simple technique . Passing to the continuum limits of k and t in any of written above master equations for the degree distributions of individ - ual vertices ( e . g . , in Eq . ( 10 ) for the exponential network or Eq . ( 20 ) for the BA model ) we get the linear partial di(cid:11)erential equations of the (cid:12)rst order which have the following solution p ( k ; s ; t ) = (cid:14) ( k (cid:0) k ( s ; t ) ) : ( 54 ) Of course , the form of this solution is rather far from the solutions of the corresponding exact master equa - tions . Nevertheless , this (cid:14) - function ansatz works ef - fectively both for exponential and scale - free networks [ 171 , 175 ] . One may even not use master equations but proceed in the following way . In the simplest example , the BA model with one vertex and one edge added at each time step , the ansatz ( 54 ) immediately leads to the equation for the average degree of vertices : @ k ( s ; t ) @ t = k ( s ; t ) R t 0 du k ( u ; t ) : ( 55 ) Equation ( 55 ) also follows from the continuum limit of the master equation for p ( k ; s ; t ) of this model , Eq . ( 20 ) . It has a simple meaning { new edges are distributed among vertices proportionally to their degrees as it is (cid:12)xed by the rule of preferential linking . The initial con - dition is k ( 0 ; 0 ) = 0 , and the boundary one , k ( t ; t ) = 1 . One sees that Eq . ( 55 ) is consistent . Indeed , applying R t 0 ds to Eq . ( 55 ) we obtain @ @ t Z t 0 ds k ( s ; t ) = Z t 0 ds @ @ tk ( s ; t ) + k ( t ; t ) = 1 + 1 ; ( 56 ) from which the proper relation follows , Z t 0 ds k ( s ; t ) = 2 t ; ( 57 ) that is , the total degree in this case equals double the number of edges . Therefore , Eq . ( 56 ) takes the form @ k ( s ; t ) @ t = 1 2 k ( s ; t ) t : ( 58 ) Its general solution is k ( s ; t ) = C ( s ) t 1 = 2 ; ( 59 ) where C ( s ) is arbitrary function of s . Accounting for the boundary condition , k ( t ; t ) = 1 , one has k ( s ; t ) = (cid:16) s t (cid:17) (cid:0) 1 = 2 : ( 60 ) Hence , the scaling exponent (cid:12) equals 1 = 2 , as we have seen before . In the continuum approach , the expression for the total degree distribution is of the form P ( k ; t ) = 1 t Z t 0 ds (cid:14) ( k (cid:0) k ( s ; t ) ) = (cid:0) 1 t (cid:18) @ k ( s ; t ) @ s (cid:19) (cid:0) 1 [ s = s ( k ; t ) ] ; ( 61 ) where s ( k ; t ) is a solution of the equation , k = k ( s ; t ) . Us - ing Eq . ( 61 ) , one may immediately reproduce the scaling relation between the exponents , so (cid:13) = 1 + 1 = (cid:12) . There - fore , in the present case , (cid:13) = 3 . F . More complex models and estimates for the WWW One may consider more complex growing networks [ 175 , 176 ] . We will demonstrate that scale - free nets may be obtained even without \ pure " preferential linking . It is convenient to consider incoming edges here , so we use the following notation for in - degree , q (cid:17) k i . old net new node m n r n FIG . 25 . Scheme of the growth of the network with a mix - ture of the preferential and random linking ( compare with the schematic Fig . 5 for the WWW growth ) . At each time step , a new vertex with n incoming edges is added . Simultaneously , the target ends of m new edges are distributed among vertices according to a rule of preferential linking , and , in addition , the target ends of n r new edges are attached to randomly chosen vertices . The source ends of each edge may be anywhere . 30 Let us describe the model ( see Fig . 25 ) : ( i ) At each time step , a new vertex is added . ( ii ) It has n incoming edges which go out from arbi - trary vertices or even from some external source . ( iii ) Simultaneously , m extra edges are distributed with preference . This means that they go out from non - speci(cid:12)ed vertices or from an external source but a target end of each of them is attached to a vertex chosen pref - erentially { probability to choose some particular vertex is proportional to q + A . A is a constant which we call additional attractiveness ( see Sec . IX B ) . We shall see that its reasonable values are A > (cid:0) n (cid:0) n r . ( iv ) In addition , at each time step , the target ends of n r edges are distributed among vertices randomly , with - out any preference . Again , these edges may go out from anywhere . In the continuum approach , one can assume that m and n are not necessarily integer numbers but are posi - tive . Note that here we do not include into consideration the source ends of edges , since we are studying only in - degree distributions . The equation for the average in - degree of vertices in this network has the form , @ q ( s ; t ) @ t = n r t + m q ( s ; t ) + A R t 0 du [ q ( u ; t ) + A ] ( 62 ) with the initial condition , q ( 0 ; 0 ) = 0 , and the bound - ary one , q ( t ; t ) = n . The (cid:12)rst term on the right - hand side accounts for linking without preference , the sec - ond one { for the preferential linking . In this case , R t 0 ds q ( s ; t ) = ( n r + m + n ) t . It follows from Eq . ( 62 ) that (cid:12) = m = ( m + n r + n + A ) , so 0 < (cid:12) < 1 , and (cid:13) i = 2 + n r + n + A m : ( 63 ) Thus , the additional fraction of randomly distributed edges does not suppress the power - law dependence of the degree distributions but only increases (cid:13) i which is in the range between 2 and in(cid:12)nity . This model allows one to obtain some estimates for the exponents of in - and out - degree distributions of the WWW [ 177 , 178 ] . Let us discuss , (cid:12)rst , the in - degree dis - tribution . We have already explained how new pages ap - pear in the Web ( see Sec . V C 2 ) . The introduced model , at least , resembles this process . The problem is that we do not know the values of the quantities on the left - hand side of Eq . ( 63 ) . The constant A may take any values between (cid:0) ( n r + n ) and in(cid:12)nity , the number of the randomly distributed edges , n r , in principle , may be not small ( there exist many individuals making their references practically at random ) , and n is not (cid:12)xed . From the experimental data [ 6 ] ( see Sec . V C 2 ) we know more or less the sum m + n + n r (cid:24) 10 (cid:29) 1 ( between 7 and 10 , more precisely ) , and that is all . The only thing we can do , is to (cid:12)x the scales of the quantities . The natural characteristic values for n r + n + A in Eq . ( 63 ) are ( a ) 0 , ( b ) 1 , ( c ) m (cid:29) 1 , and ( d ) in(cid:12)nity . In the (cid:12)rst case , all new edges are attached to the oldest vertex since only this one is attractive for linking , and (cid:13) i ! 2 . In the last case , there is no preferential link - ing , and the network is not scale - free , (cid:13) i ! 1 . Let us consider the truly important cases ( b ) and ( c ) . ( b ) Let us assume that the process of the appearance of each document in the Web is as simple as the proce - dure of the creation of your personal home page described in Sec . V C 2 . If only one reference to the new document ( n = 1 ) appears , and if one forgets about the terms n r and A in Eq . ( 63 ) , than , for the (cid:13) i exponent of the in - degree distribution , we immediately get the estimate (cid:13) i (cid:0) 2 (cid:24) 1 = m (cid:24) 10 (cid:0) 1 . This estimate indeed coincides with the experimental value (cid:13) i (cid:0) 2 = 0 : 1 [ 6 ] ( see Sec . V C 2 ) . Therefore , the estimation looks good . Neverthe - less , we should repeat , that this estimate follows only from the (cid:12)xation of the scales of the involved quantities , and many real processes are not accounted for in it . ( c ) Above we discussed the distribution of incoming links . Eq . ( 63 ) may also be applied for the distribu - tion of links which go out from documents of the Web , since the model of the previous section can easily be re - formulated for outgoing edges of vertices . In this case all the quantities in Eq . ( 63 ) take other values which are again unknown . However , we can estimate them . As we explained in Sec . V C 2 , there are usually several ci - tations ( n ) in each new WWW document . In addition , one may think that the number of the links distributing without any preference , n r , is not small now . Indeed , even beginners proceed by linking of their pages . Hence , n + n r (cid:24) m | we have no other available scale , | and (cid:13) o (cid:0) 2 (cid:24) m = m (cid:24) 1 . We can compare this estimate with the experimental value , (cid:13) o (cid:0) 2 = 0 : 7 [ 2 , 6 ] . Unfortunately , numerous channels of linking make sim - ilar contributions to the values of the exponents of the degree - distributions , so quite \ honest " estimates are im - possible . Let us introduce the \ general " model of a grow - ing directed network . In this model we account for the main channels of linking which yield contributions of the same order to (cid:13) i and (cid:13) o . This will demonstrate the com - plexity of the problem . i 0 0 0 i i i 0 i old net p’ r 0 r A A A’ A’’ p’’ A’’A’ p’’ r’ new node p i p 0 31 FIG . 26 . Scheme of the growth of the generalized model of a directed network . ( i ) At each time step , a new vertex is added . ( ii ) It has both outgoing and incoming edges . The target ends of r o outgoing edges are distributed ran - domly among old vertices . The source ends of r i incoming edges are distributed randomly among old vertices . The target ends of p o outgoing edges are distributed preferentially among old vertices with probability proportional to k i + A i . The source ends of p i incoming edges are distributed pref - erentially among old vertices with probability proportional to k o + A o . ( iii ) Simultaneously , p 0 edges are distributed preferentially between old vertices . Their target ends are distributed with the preference function , k i + A 0 i and their source ends { with the preference function k o + A 0 o . ( iv ) In addition , r 0 edges are distributed without preference among old vertices . ( v ) In addition , p 00 i connections appear be - tween old vertices with source ends being distributed without preference and with target ends { with the preference func - tion k i + A 00 i . Finally , p 00 o edges emerge between old ver - tices with target ends being distributed without preference and with source ones { with the preference function k i + A 00 o . Here A i , A o , A 0 i , A 0 o , A 00 i , and A 00 o are constants . The total number of connections that emerge at each increment of time is n t = p o + p i + r o + r i + r 0 + p 0 + p 00 i + p 00 o . The number of possible channels is so large that we have to introduce new notations . The network grows by the rules described in the caption of Fig . 26 . We ac - count for all combinations of linking without preference and linear preferential linking . Some new edges appear between new and old vertices , other connect pairs of old vertices . For di(cid:11)erent channels of linking , parameters of preferential linking di(cid:11)er from each other . Additional at - tractiveness takes di(cid:11)erent values for target and source ends of preferentially distributed edges . For brevity , we use the simplest preference functions of the form k i + A i for distribution of target ends of links and of the form k o + A o for distribution of source ends . In fact , this model generalizes the known models of networks with preferential linking of directed edges [ 169 , 175 , 179 ] . The above growing network is scale - free . Its exponents may be obtained in the continuum approach framework . Fortunately , part of parameters introduced in Fig . 26 , disappear from the (cid:12)nal expressions for (cid:13) i and (cid:13) o : (cid:13) i = 1 + (cid:20) p o n t + A i + p 0 n t + A 0 i + p 00 i n t + A 00 i (cid:21) (cid:0) 1 ; (cid:13) o = 1 + (cid:20) p i n t + A o + p 0 n t + A 0 o + p 00 o n t + A 00 o (cid:21) (cid:0) 1 : ( 64 ) In principle , one must account for all above contribu - tions . One may check that Eq . ( 63 ) is a particu - lar case of Eq . ( 64 ) . Twelve unknown parameters ( n t ; p o ; p i ; p 0 ; p 00 i ; p 00 o ; A i ; A o ; A 0 i ; A 0 o ; A 00 i ; A 00 o ) in Eq . ( 64 ) make the problem of improving of the estimate of (cid:13) i ; o ( see ( b ) and ( c ) ) hardly solvable . m cm FIG . 27 . Scheme of growth of an undirected network with creation of connections between already existing vertices . At each time step , ( i ) a new vertex is added ; ( ii ) it connects to m preferentially chosen old vertices ; ( iii ) cm new edges connect pairs of preferentially chosen old vertices . A simpler case of a growing undirected network was considered in Ref . [ 176 ] . At each time step , apart of m new edges between a new vertex and old vertices , mc new edges are created between the old vertices ( see Fig . 27 ) , so that the average degree of the network is k = 2 m ( 1 + c ) . The connections to a new vertex are distributed among old vertices like in Barab(cid:19)asi - Albert model . The proba - bility that a new edge is attached to existing vertices of degree k ( (cid:22) ) and k ( (cid:23) ) is proportional to k ( (cid:22) ) k ( (cid:23) ) . Here (cid:22) and (cid:23) are labels of the vertices . The resulting degree distribution is of a power - law form with the exponent (cid:13) = 2 + 1 1 + 2 c = 2 + m k (cid:0) m : ( 65 ) Thus , 2 < (cid:13) < 3 . The same expression is valid if , at each time step , we delete (cid:0) mc > 0 randomly chosen edges ( here c < 0 ) . m m m m r rr rp FIG . 28 . Scheme of the growth of an undirected network with the rewiring of connections in the old part of the net - work . At each time step , ( i ) a new vertex is added ; ( ii ) it connects to m preferentially chosen old vertices ; ( iii ) m r old vertices are chosen at random , and , from each of these ver - tices , one of edges is rewired to another vertex . In the m rr cases , the rewiring occurs to randomly chosen vertices . In the rest m rp = m r (cid:0) m rr of cases , the rewired edge ends are attached to preferentially chosen vertices . A very similar e(cid:11)ect produces a rewiring of edges [ 102 ] . Now , instead of the creation of connections in the old part 32 of an undirected growing network , at each time step , let each of m r randomly chosen vertices loose one of its con - nections ( see Fig . 28 ) . In m rr cases , a free end is at - tached to a random vertex . In the rest m rp = m r (cid:0) m rr cases , a free end is attached to a preferentially chosen vertex . The continuum equation for the mean degree has the form @ k ( s ; t ) @ t = ( m + m rp ) k ( s ; t ) R t 0 duk ( u ; t ) + m rr (cid:0) m r t ( 66 ) with the boundary condition k ( t ; t ) = m . From this , one gets the following expression for the exponent of the de - gree distribution : (cid:13) = 2 + m (cid:0) m rp m + m rp : ( 67 ) Notice that here we did not account for the emergence of bare vertices , so the number of the rewirings m r has to be small enough . From Eq . ( 67 ) , it follows that , as the number of the preferential rewirings grows , the (cid:13) ex - ponent decreases . Moreover , simulations in Ref . [ 102 ] demonstrated that , when the number of the rewirings is high enough , the degree distribution changes from a power law to an exponential one . One sees that the power - law in - and out - degree distri - butions arise from the power - law singularities k i ( s ; t ) / ( s = t ) (cid:0) (cid:12) i and k o ( s ; t ) / ( s = t ) (cid:0) (cid:12) o at the point s = 0 ( the oldest vertex ) . Therefore , the same vertices , as a rule , have the high values of both in - and out - degree . This means that the in - and out - degree of vertices correlate , and , of course , P ( k i ; k o ) 6 = P ( k i ) P ( k o ) ( see discussion in the paper of Krapivsky , Rodgers , and Redner [ 179 ] ) . Moreover , even if we exclude the preferential linking from such network growth process , the rule \ the oldest is the richest " is still valid for both in - and - out degree , and hence the correlation between k i and k o is again present . In Ref . [ 179 ] , the distribution P ( k i ; k o ) was analyti - cally calculated for a model of this type . To get the exact result , the authors of this paper accounted for only two channels of the preferential attachment of new edges and made a number of simplifying assumptions . In their model , ( i ) a new edge may go out of a new ver - tex and , in this case , its target end is attached to some old vertex chosen with the probability proportional to k i + A i . ( ii ) Another possibility is connection of two old vertices ( (cid:22) ) and ( (cid:23) ) with the probability proportional to ( k ( (cid:22) ) i + A 0 i ) ( k ( (cid:23) ) o + A 0 o ) ( in Ref . [ 179 ] , A 0 i = A i ) . Here , k ( (cid:22) ) i ; o and k ( (cid:23) ) i ; o are the in - and out - degrees of these vertices . In addition , parameters of the model [ 179 ] are chosen in such a way that the exponents of the in - and out - degree distributions are equal , (cid:13) i = (cid:13) o . The resulting distribu - tion has the following asymptotic form for large k i and k o , P ( k i ; k o ) / k A i (cid:0) 1 i k A 0 o o ( k i + k o ) 2 A i + 1 ; ( 68 ) which is very di(cid:11)erent from the product P ( k i ) P ( k o ) . A model of growing directed networks with preferen - tial linking was simulated in the paper [ 180 ] . In - and out - degree distributions were observed to be of power - law form . The distribution of the sizes of connected clus - ters may be also interpreted as a power - law dependence in some range of the parameters of this model . G . Types of preference providing scale - free networks Many e(cid:11)orts were made to analyse di(cid:11)erent preference functions producing scale - free networks . The power - law preference function , k y , does not produce power - law de - gree distributions if y 6 = 1 , see Sec . X . One can check that the necessary condition is a linear asymptotic form of the preference function at large values of degree [ 94 , 95 ] , so the function , in principle , may be nonlinear . Never - theless , main features can be understood if one consider linear preference functions . In general , the probability for a new link to be attached to a vertex s at time t is p ( s ; t ) = G ( s ; t ) k ( s ; t ) + A ( s ; t ) . The coe(cid:14)cient G ( s ; t ) may be called (cid:12)tness of a vertex [ 184 , 181 ] A ( s ; t ) is addi - tional attractiveness . As we have seen , A can change the values of the exponents . E(cid:11)ect of the variation of G may be even stronger . One can consider the following particular cases : ( i ) G = const , A = A ( s ) . In this case , the additional attractiveness A ( s ) may be treated as ascribed to indi - vidual vertices . A possible generalization is to make it a random quantity . One can check that the answers do not change crucially { one only has to substitute the average value , A , instead of A , into the previous expressions for the scaling exponents . Note that n and m may also be made random , and this can be accounted for by the substitution of n and m into the expressions for the exponents . There exists a more interesting possibility { to con - struct a direct generalization of the network considered in Sec . IX F where combination of the preferential and random linking was described . For this , we may ascribe the additional attractiveness not to vertices but to new edges and again make it a random quantity . In such an event , new edges play the role of fans with di(cid:11)erent pas - sion for popularity of their idols , vertices . This is the case ( ii ) , G = const , A = A ( t ) , where A ( t ) is random . If the distribution function of A is P ( A ) , the (cid:13) exponent equals (cid:13) = 1 + (cid:20)Z dA P ( A ) 1 + ( n + A ) = m (cid:21) (cid:0) 1 ; ( 69 ) see Ref . [ 175 ] . The values of the exponent are again be - tween 2 and 1 . Let us pass to situations where A = const . ( iii ) G = G ( t ) . This case reduces to case ( ii ) . 33 ( iv ) G ( s ; t ) = f ( t (cid:0) s ) , aging of vertices . This case was considered in Refs . [ 171 , 175 ] . In particular , such a form of a preference function is quite reasonable in citation networks . Indeed , we rarely cite old papers . One may check that to keep the network scale - free , the function has to be of a power - law form , G ( s ; t ) = ( t (cid:0) s ) (cid:0) (cid:11) . In princi - ple , the exponent (cid:11) may be of any sign : (cid:0)1 < (cid:11) < 1 . Negative values of (cid:11) are typical for very conservative ci - tation networks ( many references to Bible ) . Variation of the aging exponent (cid:11) produces quite distinct networks , see Fig . 29 . If (cid:11) is negative , links tends to be attached to the oldest vertices , if (cid:11) is large , the network becomes a chain structure . a = 0 . 0 a = 0 . 5 a = 2 . 0 a = 10 . 0 a = 1 . 0 a = - 10 . 0 FIG . 29 . Change of the structure of the network with ag - ing of vertices with increase of the aging exponent (cid:11) . The aging is proportional to (cid:28) (cid:0) (cid:11) , where (cid:28) is the age of a vertex . The network grows clockwise starting from the vertex below on the left . At each time step , a new vertex with one edge is added . Again it is possible to use the continuum approach . For the undirected network to which one vertex with one edge is added at each time step , after the introduction of the scaling variables , (cid:20) ( s = t ) (cid:17) k ( s ; t ) and (cid:24) (cid:17) s = t , one gets (cid:0) (cid:24) ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:24) ) (cid:11) d ln (cid:20) ( (cid:24) ) d(cid:24) = (cid:20)Z 1 0 d(cid:16)(cid:20) ( (cid:16) ) ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:16) ) (cid:0) (cid:11) (cid:21) (cid:0) 1 = (cid:12) ; (cid:20) ( 1 ) = 1 : ( 70 ) From Eq . ( 70 ) , one obtains the solution (cid:20) ( (cid:24) ; (cid:12) ) . Substi - tuting it into the right equality in Eq . ( 70 ) or , equiva - lently , into R 1 0 d(cid:16)(cid:20) ( (cid:16) ) = 2 , we get a transcendental equa - tion for (cid:12) . The resulting exponents , 0 < (cid:12) < 1 and 2 < (cid:13) < 1 , are shown in Figs . 30 and 31 [ 171 , 175 ] . −0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 a 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 b −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 a 0 0 . 3 0 . 6 0 . 9 b FIG . 30 .

Then , in the particular case of the BA model , one gets the following equation for average degree @ k ( s ; t ) @ t = G ( s ) k ( s ; t ) R t 0 ds G ( s ) k ( s ; t ) = (cid:12) ( G ( s ) ) k ( s ; t ) t ( 71 ) with the boundary condition k ( t ; t ) = 1 ( we set m = 1 without loss of generality ) . In this case , k ( s ; t ) = ( s = t ) (cid:0) (cid:12) ( G ( s ) ) . Then , it is easy to check that (cid:12) ( G ) = cG , where the constant c can be obtained from the equation Z dG P ( G ) G 1 (cid:0) cG = 1 = c : ( 72 ) Using Eq . ( 61 ) , one gets the distribution P ( k ) / Z dG P ( G ) (cid:18) 1 + 1 cG (cid:19) k (cid:0) [ 1 + 1 = ( cG ) ] : ( 73 ) If P ( G ) = (cid:14) ( G (cid:0) G 0 ) , the network is the original BA model . If P ( G ) is a distributed function , the answer changes . For instance , for P ( G ) = (cid:18) ( G ) (cid:18) ( 1 (cid:0) G ) , i . e . , when G is homogeneously distributed in the range ( 0 ; 1 ) , the distribution takes the following form : P ( k ) / Z 1 0 dG (cid:18) 1 + 1 cG (cid:19) k (cid:0) [ 1 + 1 = ( cG ) ] / k (cid:0) ( 1 + 1 = c ) ln k : ( 74 ) Here , constant c , which is the solution of Eq . ( 72 ) with homogeneous distribution P ( G ) , equals 0 : 797 : : : , so (cid:13) = 2 : 255 : : : , i . e . , it is smaller than the value (cid:13) = 3 for the homogeneous BA model . We emphasize that (cid:13) depends on a form of the distri - bution P ( G ) . In particular , results obtained with distri - bution P ( G ) , which consists of two delta - functions , are discussed in Sec . IX H . The (cid:13)uctuations of G may also be introduced into models of growing networks from Secs . IX B , IX E , and IX F . Results are similar to Eq . ( 74 ) . A combination of (cid:13)uctuating additional attractiveness A ( s ) and (cid:13)uctuating (cid:12)tness G ( s ) was considered in Ref . [ 182 ] . Calculations in this paper are very similar to the above derivation ( an explicit rate - equation approach [ 94 , 95 , 179 ] was used ) , but the result , namely the (cid:13) ex - ponent of the power - law dependence , corrected by a log - arithmic denominator , depends on the form of the joint distribution P ( A ; G ) . In Ref . [ 182 ] one may also (cid:12)nd the results for the exponents of in - and out - degree dis - tributions of a directed growing network with (cid:13)uctuating (cid:12)tness . One should note that most of the existing models of networks growing under mechanism of preferential link - ing produce the e(cid:11)ect \ the oldest is the richest " . ( Here we do not dwell on situations when old vertices may die , divide into parts , or stop to attach new edges . The last possibility was studied in Refs . [ 167 , 168 ] , and this is the case , where young vertices may have larger degrees than old vertices . Also , if vertices may divide into parts , it is hard to de(cid:12)ne the age of a vertex at large temporal scales . ) Even in the case of (cid:13)uctuating (cid:12)tness G , older vertices are , with high probability , of larger degree than young vertices . Indeed , the power - law degree distribu - tions have to be accompanied by strong singularities of the average degree of individual vertices k ( s ; t ) at s = 0 . This follows from the derivations of scale - free degree dis - tributions in the present section . The (cid:13)uctuations of G produce broadening of the degree distribution of indi - vidual vertices p ( k ; s ; t ) . In Sec . IX H we will consider the situation in which the in - homogeneity of G provides stronger e(cid:11)ect than considered here . It was stated in Ref . [ 117 ] that degree distribution of individual vertices ( sites ) of the Web practically does not depend on their age . This indicates inapplicability of the preferential linking concept . Authors of Ref . [ 183 ] ex - plained that these data are not su(cid:14)cient to exclude the rule \ the oldest is the richest " and that just the inhomo - geneity of (cid:12)tness G hampers the observation of such an e(cid:11)ect . H . \ Condensation " of edges In the last of above situations , that is , in the case of inhomogeneous (cid:12)tness G , the form of resulting degree distributions crucially depends on the form of the distri - bution P ( G ) . For some special forms of P ( G ) , a striking phenomenon occurs [ 184 ] . One or several the \ strongest " vertices with the largest G may capture a (cid:12)nite fraction of all edges . A related e(cid:11)ect was considered in Ref . [ 185 ] . In Ref . [ 184 ] this intriguing e(cid:11)ect was called \ Bose - Einstein condensation " . One can explain the essence of this phe - nomenon using a simple example [ 175 ] . Let us use the model of a growing network with di - rected edges introduced in Sec . IX E . To simplify the formulas , we set A = 0 ( one can see that this does not reduce the generality of the model which produces scal - ing exponents in the wide ranges of values , 2 < (cid:13) < 1 and 0 < (cid:12) < 1 ) . Let the rule of preference be the same as in Sec . IX E , i . e . , the probability that an edge is at - tached to vertex s is proportional to the in - degree q s of the vertex but with one exception | one vertex , ~ s , is \ stronger " than others . This means that the probabil - ity that this vertex attracts an edge is higher . It has an additional factor , g > 1 , and proportional to gq ~ s . This means that G s = 1 + ( g (cid:0) 1 ) (cid:14) s ; ~ s . The equations for the average in - degree are 35 @ q ~ s ( t ) @ t = m gq ~ s ( t ) ( g (cid:0) 1 ) q ~ s ( t ) + R t 0 ds q ( s ; t ) ; q ~ s ( t = ~ s ) = q i ; @ q ( s ; t ) @ t = m q ( s ; t ) ( g (cid:0) 1 ) q ~ s ( t ) + R t 0 ds q ( s ; t ) ; q ( t ; t ) = n : ( 75 ) In the second of Eqs . ( 75 ) , s 6 = ~ s . Obviously , at long times , the total in - degree of the network is R t 0 ds q ( s ; t ) = ( m + n ) t + O ( 1 ) . At t (cid:29) ~ s , two situations are possible . In the (cid:12)rst one , the in - degree q ~ s ( t ) of the strongest vertex grows slower than t , and , at long times , the denominators are equal to ( m + n ) t , so that we get the exponents , (cid:12) = m = ( m + n ) (cid:17) (cid:12) 0 and (cid:13) = 2 + n = m (cid:17) (cid:13) 0 = 1 + 1 = (cid:12) 0 , were 0 < (cid:12) 0 < 1 ; 2 < (cid:13) 0 < 1 . Here , we introduce the exponents , (cid:13) 0 and (cid:12) 0 , of the network in which all vertices have equal \ strength " ( (cid:12)tness ) , g = 1 . The (cid:12)rst line of Eq . ( 75 ) , in this case , looks as @ q ~ s ( t ) @ t = gm m + n gq ~ s ( t ) t : ( 76 ) Hence , at long times , q ~ s ( t ) = const ( q i ) t gm = ( m + n ) , and we see that the in - degree of the strong vertex does grow slower than t only for g < g c (cid:17) 1 + n m = (cid:13) 0 (cid:0) 1 = (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 0 > 1 ; ( 77 ) so we obtain the natural threshold value . In the other situation , g > g c , at long times , we have the only possibility , q ~ s ( t ) = d t , d is some constant , d < m + n , since a more rapid growth of q ~ s ( t ) is impos - sible in principle . This means that , for g > g c , a (cid:12)nite fraction of all preferentially distributed edges is captured by the strong vertex ( in Ref . [ 184 ] just this situation is called the Bose - Einstein condensation ) . We see that a single strong vertex may produce a macroscopic e(cid:11)ect . In this case , Eq . ( 75 ) takes the form , @ q ~ s ( t ) @ t = gm ( g (cid:0) 1 ) d + m + n q ~ s ( t ) t ; @ q ( s ; t ) @ t = m ( g (cid:0) 1 ) d + m + n q ( s ; t ) t ; ( 78 ) where in the second of Eqs . ( 78 ) , s 6 = ~ s . Note that the coe(cid:14)cient in the (cid:12)rst equation is always larger than the coe(cid:14)cient in the second equation , since g c > 1 . From the (cid:12)rst of Eqs . ( 78 ) , we get the condition gm ( g (cid:0) 1 ) d + m + n = 1 ; ( 79 ) so , for g > g c , the following fraction of all edges in the network is captured by the strongest vertex : d m + n = d m m m + n = 1 g c g (cid:0) g c g (cid:0) 1 : ( 80 ) We have to emphasize that the resulting value of d is in - dependent on initial conditions ! ( Recall that we consider the long - time limit . ) This \ condensation " of edges on the \ strongest " vertex leads to change of exponents . Us - ing the condition Eq . ( 79 ) , we readily get the following expressions for them , (cid:12) = 1 g < (cid:12) 0 ; (cid:13) = 1 + g > (cid:13) 0 : ( 81 ) The fraction of all edges captured by the strongest ver - tex and the (cid:12) and (cid:13) exponents vs . g are shown in Fig . 32 . Note that the growth of g increases the value of the (cid:13) exponent . If the World is captured by Bill Gates or some czar , the distribution of wealth becomes more fair ! One should note that the strong vertex does not take edges away from other vertices but only intercepts them . The closer (cid:13) 0 is to 2 , the smaller g is necessary to exceed the threshold . Above the threshold , the values of the expo - nents are determined only by the factor g . Nevertheless , the expression for d = ( m + n ) contains (cid:13) 0 , the exponent of the homogeneous network . ( Recall that the threshold value is g c = (cid:13) 0 (cid:0) 1 ) . g g 0 b 0 d / ( m + n ) b 0 - 1 1 g 0 b 0 b 0 36 FIG . 32 . \ Condensation " of edges . Fraction of all edges , d = ( m + n ) , captured by a single strong vertex at long times and the scaling exponents (cid:12) and (cid:13) vs . relative (cid:12)tness g of the strong vertex [ 175 ] . The network contains only one \ strong " vertex . The condensation occurs above the threshold value g c = 1 = (cid:12) 0 = (cid:13) 0 (cid:0) 1 > 1 . Here (cid:12) 0 and (cid:13) 0 are the corre - sponding exponents for the network without a strong vertex . d = ( m + n ) [ g ! 1 ] ! (cid:12) 0 and (cid:12) [ g ! 1 ] ! 0 .

Schematic plot of the degree distribution of the network with one vertex , the (cid:12)tness of which exceeds the threshold value [ 175 ] . The peak is due to edges \ condensed " on the strong vertex . A hump at the cuto(cid:11) of the continuum part of the distribution is a trace of initial conditions ( see Sec . IXD and Ref . [ 166 ] ) . For g > g c , in the edge condensation regime , the strongest vertex determines the evolution of the network . With increasing time , a gap between the in - degree of the strongest vertex and the maximal in - degree of all oth - ers grows ( see Fig . 33 ) . A small peak at the end of the continuum part of the distribution is a trace of initial con - ditions , see Sec . IX D . Note that the network remains scale - free even above the threshold , i . e . , for g > g c , al - though (cid:13) grows with growing g . The above - described initial - condition - independent state is realized only in the limit of large networks . In the \ condensate phase " , relaxation to the (cid:12)nal state is of a power - law kind [ 175 ] : q ~ s ( t ) (cid:0) d t ( m + n ) t / t (cid:0) ( g (cid:0) g c ) = g ( 82 ) i . e . , the fraction of all edges captured by the strong ver - tex relaxes to the (cid:12)nal value by a power law . Its ex - ponent ( g (cid:0) g c ) = g approaches zero at the condensation point g = g c . This behavior evokes strong associations with critical relaxation . The threshold , that is , the \ condensation point " , can be easily smeared in the following way . Let vertices have , at random , two values of (cid:12)tness , 1 and g > 1 , the prob - ability that a vertex has (cid:12)tness 1 is 1 (cid:0) p , and , with probability p , a vertex has (cid:12)tness g . The characteristics of such a network are shown in Fig . 34 . These are the fraction of all vertices captured by the component of the network consisting of \ strong vertices " and the scaling exponents of both components as functions of g . One sees that the threshold is smeared , and the condensation phenomenon is absent . g g 0 b 0 d / ( m + n ) b 0 - 1 1 g 0 b 0 b 0 2 1 g g 1 b 1 b g g FIG . 34 . Fraction of all edges , d = ( m + n ) , captured by the component of \ strong " vertices , at long times and the scaling exponents (cid:12) and (cid:13) vs . relative (cid:12)tness , g , of \ strong " vertices [ 171 ] . The network contains two kinds of vertices | \ weak " vertices and \ strong " ones . We introduce two sets of expo - nents for the two components of the network , (cid:12) 1 and (cid:13) 1 { for the component consisting of vertices with the unit (cid:12)tness ( contains ( 1 (cid:0) p ) t vertices ) and (cid:12) g and (cid:13) g { for the component consisting of vertices with the (cid:12)tness g ( contains pt vertices ) . Thin lines depict the dependences at (cid:12)xed values of p . Ar - rows show how these curves change when p decreases from 1 to 0 . At p ! 0 , we obtain dependences shown in Fig . 32 ( a single strong vertex ) . At p ! 1 , d = ( m + n ) ! 1 , (cid:12) g ! (cid:12) 0 , (cid:12) 1 ! (cid:12) 0 = g , (cid:13) 1 ! 1 + g = (cid:12) 0 , (cid:13) g ! (cid:13) 0 . For the observation of the condensation of edges , spe - cial distributions P ( G ) are needed . If P ( G ) is continuous , it must be of a speci(cid:12)c form in the region of the largest (cid:12)tness , G max [ 184 ] . The structure of the network for the continuous distribution P ( G ) was discussed in Sec . IX G . We have already described the situation when the transcendental equation ( 72 ) has a real root c . For some distributions , including the considered case of a single 37 strong vertex with g > g c , this is impossible . This indi - cates the condensation phenomenon | a (cid:12)nite fraction of edges condenses on a single vertex with the largest (cid:12)tness . At this point we must make the following remark . All the growing networks that we consider in the present sec - tion have a general feature { each of their vertices has a chance to get a new link . Only one circumstance pre - vents their enrichment { seizure of this link by another vertex . In such kinetics of distribution of edges , there is no (cid:12)nite radius of \ interaction " and there are no princi - pal obstacles for capture of a great fraction of edges by some vertex . Bianconi and Barab(cid:19)asi [ 184 ] noticed that the form of Eq . ( 72 ) is similar to the form of the well - known equa - tion for the Bose gas . Edges were interpreted as Bose - particles . They are distributed among energy levels | vertices . The energy of each level was related to the (cid:12)t - ness G of the corresponding vertex . The distribution of these levels can be obtained from P ( G ) . One may in - dicate a set of the distributions P ( G ) for which there is no solution of Eq . ( 72 ) like in the classical phenomenon of Bose condensation . Using the analogy with this phe - nomenon , Bianconi and Barab(cid:19)asi demonstrated that , in this \ phase " , a (cid:12)nite fraction of edges ( particles of the Bose - gas ) condenses on the strongest vertex ( the lowest energy level ) and called this process \ Bose - Einstein con - densation " [ 184 ] . One can use various parameterizations of P ( G ) but it is natural to study its variation mainly near G max . E . g . , in Ref . [ 184 ] , it was shown that P ( G ) / ( G max (cid:0) G ) (cid:18) produces the condensation starting from some minimal value of the exponent (cid:18) c . In fact , in paper [ 184 ] , the equations describing the distribution of edges among vertices of the large network with inhomogeneous (cid:12)tting are mapped to the equations for the Bose gas . The price of this mapping is the in - troduction of thermodynamic quantities such as temper - ature , etc . for the description of the network . Unfor - tunately , it is not easy to (cid:12)nd an interpretation , e . g . , for temperature in this situation . It is \ something " re - lated to the form of P ( G ) . Therefore , here , we prefer to consider the \ condensation " e(cid:11)ect without applying such analogies and the introduction of thermodynamic variables but directly using the distribution P ( G ) . I . Correlations and distribution of edges over network In the present section , we mainly studied degree dis - tributions . We have to admit , however , that they pro - vide rather incomplete description of a growing network . One can better imagine the network if the average el - ements of the adjacency matrix are known . Their val - ues are easily calculated in the continuum approxima - tion . In the simplest case of the citation graph , the av - erage number of edges b ( s ; s 0 ; t ) between vertices s and s 0 at time t ( s < s 0 (cid:20) t ) has a very convenient feature , b ( s ; s 0 ; t (cid:21) s 0 ) = b ( s ; s 0 ; s 0 ) . This crucially simpli(cid:12)es the calculations , and the result for scale - free citation graphs is b ( s ; s 0 ; t ) = m t ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:12) ) (cid:16) s t (cid:17) (cid:0) (cid:12) (cid:18) s 0 t (cid:19) (cid:12) (cid:0) 1 ; ( 83 ) where m is the number of connections of each new ver - tex ( see Ref . [ 175 ] ) . Recall that (cid:12) = 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) . This characteristic was obtained exactly for the model of Sec . IX C . One sees that , generally , the product does not fac - torize to k ( s ; t ) k ( s 0 ; t ) . The only exception is the (cid:12) = 1 = 2 ( (cid:13) = 3 ) case . From Eq . ( 83 ) , in the scaling regime , we can estimate the average number of connections between ancestor vertices of degree k and descendants with de - gree k 0 . In the continuum approximation , this quantity is proportional to the probability P ( k ; k 0 ) that vertices of degree k ( ancestor ) and k 0 ( descendant ) are connected : P ( k ; k 0 ) / k (cid:0) 1 = (cid:12) k 0(cid:0) 2 = k (cid:0) ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) k 0(cid:0) 2 : ( 84 ) The origin of the factor k (cid:0) ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) on the left - hand side of the equation is clear : new vertices are attached to old ones with probability (cid:24) kP ( k ) , where P ( k ) is the de - gree distribution . Meanwhile , degrees of nearest neigh - bors of a vertex in equilibrium scale - free networks are also distributed as kP ( k ) . Indeed , in equilibrium net - works with statistically uncorrelated vertices , this degree distribution coincides with that for an end vertex ( either of the two ones ) of a randomly chosen edge , which is proportional to kP ( k ) ( see Sec . XI A ) . Then , in equilib - rium networks , the probability that a randomly chosen edge connects vertices of degrees k and k 0 is P ( k ; k 0 ) = kP ( k ) k 0 P ( k 0 ) = [ P k kP ( k ) ] 2 , that di(cid:11)ers sharply from Eq . ( 84 ) . The factor k 0(cid:0) 2 in Eq . ( 84 ) is , in particular , the degree distribution of the nearest neighbors of the oldest ( the richest ) vertex ( compare with the degree distribu - tion of the nearest neighbors of a new vertex , k (cid:0) ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) ) . The distribution P ( k ; k 0 ) was originally obtained by Krapivsky and Redner [ 95 ] in the framework of the rate equation approach [ 94 , 95 , 179 ] which is similar to the master equation one , which was discussed in Sec . IX B , so we do not present their details here . The main statement is that this probability does not factorize . This means that degrees of neighboring vertices in growing networks are correlated . If one keeps (cid:12)xed the large degree k of an ancestor ver - tex , then , the most probable linking is with a descendant vertex of the smallest degree k 0 (cid:24) 1 . If the large degree k 0 of a descendant vertex is (cid:12)xed , the above probability has a maximum at some k which is smaller than k 0 but of the order of it . This absence of the factorization ( the correlations ) in - dicates a sharp di(cid:11)erence of growing networks from equi - librium graphs with statistically independent vertices . The reason is the obvious absence of time - reversal sym - metry | quite natural asymmetry between parents and 38 children . Therefore , these correlations are present even for networks growing without preferential linking . Reliable measurements of the joint degree distribution of neighboring vertices , P ( k ; k 0 ) , are di(cid:14)cult because of poor statistics . Nevertheless , one can easily obtain in - formation about the correlations in a network measuring the dependence of the average degree of nearest neigh - bors of a vertex on its degree , k nn ( k ) ( see discussion of the empirical data [ 96 ] in Sec . V C1 ) . This is an impor - tant characteristic of correlations in growing network , so let us discuss it brie(cid:13)y . For a scale - free citation graph with the degree distri - bution exponent (cid:13) < 3 , from Eq . ( 83 ) , one may eas - ily obtain the dependence k nn ( k ) / k (cid:0) ( 3 (cid:0) (cid:13) ) for small enough degrees k . For larger k , the dependence is a slow , logarithm - like function . If , in addition , new connections in a growing scale - free network also emerge between old vertices , the form of k nn ( k ) depends on the details of the linking procedure . For example , ( a ) if new connections in the old part of the network emerge without any preference , the power - law singularity in k nn ( k ) is retained ; ( b ) if these edges connect randomly chosen old vertices with old vertices which are chosen preferentially , the power - law singular - ity is retained ; but ( c ) if these edges connect pairs pref - erentially chosen old vertices , the singularity disappears as the number of such connections increases . For directed networks , it is easy to introduce the no - tions of in - and out - components with respect to any ver - tex . One can de(cid:12)ne the out - component as the set of all \ ancestors " of the vertex plus itself , i . e . , all the vertices that can be reached if one starts from this vertex [ 95 ] . The in - component of the vertex contains all the vertices from which it can be reached , i . e . , all its \ descendants " plus itself . The distribution of the sizes of the in - and out - components of citation graphs ( which are , in fact , di - rected networks ) and their other characteristics were cal - culated in Ref . [ 95 ] . These results provide information about the topology of these networks . For the cita - tion networks with t vertices , the distribution of the in - component sizes s was found to be proportional to t = s 2 for s (cid:29) 1 . This relation is valid for a wide variety of preference functions , including even the absence of any preference . For such a form of the in - component size dis - tribution , the following condition is necessary : the power y in the preference function k y should not exceed 1 . In Ref . [ 95 ] , the out - components of scale - free citation graphs were studied . E . g . , for the BA model , that is , for the citation graph with (cid:13) = 3 , the out - component size distribution is ln s (cid:0) 1 ( t + 1 ) = [ ( t + 1 ) ( s (cid:0) 1 ) ! ] . Here , s is the out - component size . This form is valid for the net - work with one edge ( and , as usually , one vertex ) added per unit of time . The distribution has a maximum at s (cid:0) 1 = ln ( t + 1 ) and quickly decays at larger s . Hence , the typical size of the out - component is of the order of ln t , i . e . of the order of the typical shortest - path length in classical random graphs ( see Sec . III B ) . Similar re - sults were obtained for all scale - free citation graphs [ 95 ] . The relation for typical size of the out - component is also valid for any citation graph with power y of the prefer - ence function k y less or equal 1 . In this respect , these networks are similar to the classical random graphs . J . Accelerated growth of networks The linear growth , when the total number of edges in the network is a linear function of its size ( the total number of vertices ) , is only a particular case of the net - work evolution . For instance , data on the WWW growth [ 175 ] ( see Sec . V C 2 ) , for the Internet [ 5 , 96 , 107 ] ( see Sec . V C 1 ) , for networks of citations in scienti(cid:12)c litera - ture [ 100 ] ( see Sec . V A ) , and for collaboration networks [ 15 , 101 ] ( see Sec . V B ) demonstrate that the total num - bers of edges in these networks grow faster than the total numbers of vertices , and one can say that the growth is accelerated [ 186 ] , that is , nonlinear . One can show that a power - law dependence of the in - put (cid:13)ow of links may produce scale - free networks [ 186 ] , and non - stationary degree distributions may emerge . In such a case , the scaling relations of Sec . IX D are eas - ily generalized . In the limit of the large network size , in general , one can write P ( k ; t ) / t z k (cid:0) (cid:13) ; ( 85 ) and k ( s ; t ) / t (cid:14) (cid:16) s t (cid:17) (cid:0) (cid:12) : ( 86 ) General relations in the present subsection are valid for degree - , in - degree , and out - degree distributions , so that here k denotes not only degree but also in - and out - degree . One can show that the exponents z , (cid:14) , and (cid:12) are coupled by the relation , z = (cid:14) = (cid:12) , and the old rela - tion ( 34 ) is valid . The distribution for individual vertices now is of the form p ( k ; s ; t ) = s 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) t ( 1 + z ) = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) f (cid:18) k s 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) t ( 1 + z ) = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) (cid:19) : ( 87 ) Also , P ( k ; t ) = t z k (cid:0) (cid:13) F ( kt (cid:0) ( 1 + z ) (cid:12) ) = t z k (cid:0) (cid:13) F ( kt (cid:0) ( 1 + z ) = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) ) ; ( 88 ) and the distribution has a cut - o(cid:11) at k cut (cid:24) t ( 1 + z ) = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) . We emphasize that Eqs . ( 87 ) and ( 88 ) are quite general relations obtained from the assumption of a power - law dependence of the total number of edges on the total number of vertices in the network . As demonstrating examples , in Ref . [ 186 ] , two mod - els for accelerating growth of networks with preferential linking were studied . In particular , the in - degree distri - butions of directed networks were considered . The input 39 (cid:13)ow of edges is suggested to grow as t a , where a is a new exponent , a < 1 . The restriction is introduced to avoid multiple edges in the network at long times . In the (cid:12)rst model , the additional attractiveness is con - stant . In this case , (cid:12) = 1 + a , (cid:13) = 1 + 1 = ( 1 + a ) , (cid:14) = z = 0 , and the degree - distribution is stationary ( if we ignore its time - dependent cuto(cid:11) ) , see Fig . 35 , a . Therefore , the degree distribution of a non - linearly growing scale - free network may have the (cid:13) exponent less than 2 . When the input (cid:13)ow of edges grows proportionally to t , (cid:13) = 3 = 2 . The second model is also based on the model of Sec . IX E but , in this case , the additional attractive - ness A ( or the number of incoming edges n of new nodes ) grows with increasing time . For instance , let the additional attractiveness be proportional to the av - erage in - degree of the network with a constant factor , A ( t ) = Bq ( t ) = Bc 0 t a = ( 1 + a ) . In this case , the (cid:13) ex - ponent exceeds 2 and the distribution is non - stationary : (cid:13) = 2 + B ( 1 + a ) = ( 1 (cid:0) Ba ) , (cid:12) = ( 1 (cid:0) Ba ) = ( 1 + B ) , (cid:14) = a , and z = a ( 1 + B ) = ( 1 (cid:0) Ba ) ( see Fig . 35 , b ) . In such an event , the scaling regime is realized only if Ba < 1 . L og P ( q ) 10 Log q 10 g < 2 L og P ( q ) 10 Log q 10 g > 2 b ) a ) FIG . 35 . Schematic log - log plots of degree distributions in the two models for accelerating growth of networks which are discussed in Sec . IXJ . The (cid:12)rst model produces the sta - tionary degree distribution with the exponent (cid:13) < 2 ( a ) at long times . The degree distribution of the second model ( b ) is non - stationary , (cid:13) > 2 . The arrows indicate changes of the distributions as the networks grow . The same results are valid for degree distributions of undirected networks which grow nonlinearly . In general , assuming a power - law dependence of the input (cid:13)ow of edges on the network size ( a > 0 ) , it is easy to obtain the following relations for the exponents (cid:13) , z , and a [ 175 , 186 ] . If one assumes that 1 < (cid:13) < 2 , then (cid:13) = 1 + 1 + z 1 + a ; ( 89 ) so z should be smaller than a . This situation is realized in the (cid:12)rst model above ( see Fig . 35 , a ) . At long times , the degree distribution is stationary . One may show that the cuto(cid:11) k cut (cid:24) t a + 1 , that is , of the order of the total degree of the network , so that the cuto(cid:11) is in fact absent . If one assumes (cid:13) > 2 , the relation (cid:13) = 1 + z a ( 90 ) is valid , so that one has to have z > a . The distribution is non - stationary ( see Fig . 35 , b ) , and this is the case for the latter model . In both above models , the input (cid:13)ow was preset , that is , we suggest its power - law time dependence . However , such a power - law growth may arise quite naturally . Let us consider an illustrating example . An undirected cita - tion graph grows according the following rules : ( i ) one new vertex is added to the network in unit time ; ( ii ) with a probability 1 (cid:0) p it connects to a randomly chosen vertex or , with complementary probability p , not only to this vertex but also to all its nearest neighbors . If one is interested only in exponents , the same result is valid if a new vertex connects to a randomly chosen vertex plus to some of its nearest neighbors , each being chosen with the probability p . A new vertex actually copies ( inherits ) a fraction of connections of its ancestor ( compare with a network growth process which leads to multifractal distributions [ 187 , 188 ] , see Sec . X ) . Such copying processes may be realized , for example , in net - works of protein - protein interactions ( see discussion in Ref . [ 189 ] ) . These growth rules lead to an e(cid:11)ective linear preferen - tial attachment of edges to vertices with a large number of connections . One can easily see that the average de - gree ( and the input (cid:13)ow of vertices ) of this graph grows as t 2 p (cid:0) 1 when p > 1 = 2 . For p < 1 = 2 , the mean degree approaches the constant value 2 = ( 1 (cid:0) 2 p ) at long times , and the degree distribution is stationary with exponent (cid:13) = 1 + 1 = p > 3 . When p > 1 = 2 , the degree distri - bution is non - stationary , like in the latter model , and (cid:13) = 1 + 1 = ( 1 (cid:0) p ) > 3 . 40 A model of a directed growing network , whose mean degree logarithmically grows with t , was proposed by V(cid:19)azquez [ 170 ] . The preferential linking arises in this model dynamically . Simulations and heuristic arguments in Ref . [ 170 ] have showed that the exponent (cid:13) of this net - work is equal or close to 2 . Above models have input (cid:13)ow of edges growing propor - tionally to t a . The situation when it grows as t a + const is also very interesting . Of course , at long times , such growth yields the above distributions . However , for real (cid:12)nite networks , this limit may not be approached . An intriguing application of these ideas can be proposed for the word web having been constructed in Ref . [ 126 ] ( see Sec . V D 5 ) . Recall that the empirical degree distribution of the word web has a complex form ( see Fig . 9 ) with two dis - tinct regions . A high quality of the empirical degree dis - tribution due to the large number of vertices in the word web , t (cid:25) 470 000 , and its high mean degree k ( t ) (cid:25) 72 to - gether with the speci(cid:12)c complex form gives a real chance to explain convincingly the structure of the word web . new word webword c t FIG . 36 . Scheme of the word web growth [ 127 ] . At each time step a new word appears , so t is the total number of words . It connects to some preferentially chosen old word . Si - multaneously , ct new undirected edges emerge between pairs of preferentially chosen old words . All the edges are undi - rected . We use the simplest kind of the preferential attach - ment when a vertex is chosen with the probability propor - tional to the number of its connections . Let us consider the minimal model for the evolving word web [ 127 ] ( see the discussion of practically the same model for networks of collaborations in Ref . [ 15 ] ) . We use the following rules of the growth of this undirected net - work ( see Fig . 36 ) . At each time step , a new vertex ( word ) is added to the network , and the total number of vertices , t , plays the role of time . At its birth , the new word connects to several old ones . We do not know the original number of connections . We only know that it is of the order of 1 . It would be unfair to play with an un - known parameter to (cid:12)t the experimental data , so we set this number to 1 ( one can check that the introduction of this parameter does not change the degree distribution of the word web noticeably ) . We use the simplest natu - ral version of the preferential linking , so a new word is connected to some old one (cid:22) with the probability pro - portional to its degree k (cid:22) , like in the Barab(cid:19)asi - Albert model [ 55 ] . In addition , at each increment of time , ct new edges emerge between old words , where c is a constant coe(cid:14)cient that characterizes a particular network . The linear dependence appears if each vertex makes new con - nections at a constant rate , and we choose it as the most simple and natural . These new edges emerge between old words (cid:22) and (cid:23) with the probability proportional to the product of their degrees k (cid:22) k (cid:23) [ 102 , 176 ] ( see Sec . IX F ) . The mean degree of the network is equal to k ( t ) = 2 + ct . According to the preceding analysis , this yields the stationary degree distribution with the exponent (cid:13) = 3 = 2 at long times . The additional constant , equal to 2 , is important if we are interested in how the stationary dis - tribution is approached . Simple calculations [ 127 ] in the framework of the continuum approach yield the following degree distribution P ( k ; t ) = 1 ct cs ( 2 + cs ) 1 + 2 cs 1 k ; ( 91 ) where s = s ( k ; t ) is the solution of the equation k ( s ; t ) = (cid:18) ct cs (cid:19) 1 = 2 (cid:18) 2 + ct 2 + cs (cid:19) 3 = 2 : ( 92 ) This distribution has two distinct regions separated by the crossover point k cross (cid:25) p ct ( 2 + ct ) 3 = 2 . The crossover moves in the direction of large degrees while the net - work grows . Below this point , the degree distribution is stationary , P ( k ) (cid:24) = 12 k (cid:0) 3 = 2 ( we use the fact that in the word web ct (cid:29) 1 ) . Above the crossover point , we obtain P ( k ; t ) (cid:24) = 14 ( ct ) 3 k (cid:0) 3 , so that the degree distribution is non - stationary in this region . At (cid:12)rst sight , contribution to the average degree of the network ( or the input (cid:13)ow of new links ) from connections to new words seems negligible when compared with links which emerge between old words ( 2 (cid:28) ct (cid:25) 70 ) . Nev - ertheless , as we see , this small contribution produces an observable e(cid:11)ect . The position of the cuto(cid:11) produced by (cid:12)nite - size e(cid:11)ect ( see Sec . IX D for the relation t R 1 k cut dk P ( k ) (cid:24) 1 ) , is k cut (cid:24) p t = 8 ( ct ) 3 = 2 . In Fig . 9 , we plot the degree distri - bution of the model ( the solid line ) . To obtain the the - oretical curve , known parameters of the word web were used , t and k ( t ) . The deviations from the continuum approximation are accounted for in the small k region , k < 10 . One sees that agreement with the empirical dis - tribution is excellent . Positions of theoretical crossover and cuto(cid:11) are also perfect . Note that no (cid:12)tting was made . For a better comparison , in Fig . 9 , the theoretical curve is displaced upward to exclude two experimental points with the smallest k since these points are depen - dent on the method of the construction of the word web , and any comparison in this region is meaningless in prin - ciple . Note that few words are in the region above the crossover point k cross (cid:25) 5 (cid:2) 10 3 . As language grows , k cross increases rapidly but , as it follows from above re - lations , the total number of words of degree greater than 41 k cross does not change . It is a constant of the order of 1 = ( 8 c ) (cid:25) t = ( 8 k ) (cid:24) 10 3 , that is , of the order of the size of a small set of words forming the kernel lexicon of the British English which was estimated as 5 000 words [ 190 ] . Thus , the size of the core of language does not vary as language evolves . K . Decaying networks In Sec . IX F we have described a wide spec - trum of possibilities to add edges to a network . Results for various cases may be found in Refs . [ 55 , 56 , 94 , 95 , 166 , 169 , 175 , 179 , 180 , 184 , 181 , 183 ] . Here , we discuss the opposite situation , namely , a fraction of edges may disappear during the network growth . This situa - tion , an additional permanent deletion of edges , is con - sidered in Refs . [ 102 , 176 , 175 ] . Here we write down the result for a typical case of the model of directed grow - ing network from Sec . IX F in which we , for brevity , set n = 0 . Each time a vertex and m edges are added , c old randomly chosen connections disappear . If we de(cid:12)ne (cid:13) i ( c = 0 ) (cid:17) (cid:13) 0 , the (cid:13) i exponent is (cid:13) i = 2 + (cid:13) 0 (cid:0) 2 1 (cid:0) (cid:13) 0 c = m + ( c = m ) 2 : ( 93 ) The resulting phase diagram , c = m vs . (cid:13) 0 is shown in Fig . 37 . One sees that random removal of edges in - creases the (cid:13) i exponent which grows monotonously with increasing c = m until it becomes in(cid:12)nite on the line (cid:13) 0 = ( c = m ) + 1 = ( c = m ) . In the dashed region of Fig . 37 , the network is out of the class of scale - free nets . Note that , for large enough c = m , the network may decay to a set of uncoupled clusters . 3 4 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 g 0 c / m 5 2 FIG . 37 . Phase diagram of the directed network growing under condition of permanent random damage { the perma - nent deletion of random edges | on axis (cid:13) 0 , c = m . At each time step , m new edges are added and c random edges are deleted ( see the text ) . (cid:13) 0 is the scaling exponent of the corre - sponding network growing without deletion of edges . Curves in the plot are lines of constant (cid:13) i . (cid:13) i = 1 on the line (cid:13) 0 = ( c = m ) + ( c = m ) (cid:0) 1 . In the dashed region , the network is out of the class of scale - free nets . The e(cid:11)ect of permanent random damage ( the removal of edges ) on undirected growing networks , in fact , has been considered in Sec . IX F ( see the discussion of Eq . ( 65 ) ) . The permanent random removal of vertices produces a di(cid:11)erent e(cid:11)ect on the growing networks with prefer - ential linking [ 175 ] . In this case , the (cid:13) exponent does not change . Nevertheless , the exponent (cid:12) varies . Let a randomly chosen vertex be deleted with probability c each time a new vertex is added to the network . If , again we introduce the notations (cid:13) ( c = 0 ) (cid:17) (cid:13) 0 and (cid:12) ( c = 0 ) (cid:17) (cid:12) 0 , then one can show that (cid:12) = (cid:12) 0 = ( 1 (cid:0) c ) and (cid:13) = 1 + 1 = [ (cid:12) ( 1 (cid:0) c ) ] = 1 + 1 = (cid:12) 0 = (cid:13) 0 . We see that the scaling relation ( 34 ) is violated in this situa - tion . The reason of this violation and of the change of (cid:12) is an e(cid:11)ective re - normalization of the s variable due to the removal of vertices . In such an event , scaling forms of the degree - distributions for individual vertices and of the total degree - distribution are p ( k ; s ; t ) = ( s = t ) (cid:12) f [ k ( s = t ) (cid:12) ] and P ( k ) = k (cid:0)f 1 + 1 = [ (cid:12) ( 1 (cid:0) c ) ] g F ( k = t (cid:12) ) . One can show that the permanent deletion of a frac - tion of vertices with the largest values of degree , that is an analogy of intentional damage ( attack ) [ 59 , 63 , 62 ] , destroys the scaling behavior of the network [ 175 ] . L . Eigenvalue spectrum of the adjacency matrix The structure of the adjacency matrix and , therefore , of the network itself , can be characterized by its eigen - value spectrum G ( (cid:21) ) . The eigenvalue spectra of classi - cal random graphs are well studied . For the undirected in(cid:12)nite random graph with the Poisson degree distribu - tion , the ( re - scaled ) eigenvalue spectrum has a semi - circle shape ( here , G ( (cid:21) ) = G ( (cid:0) (cid:21) ) ) [ 191 , 192 ] . If such a graph is large but (cid:12)nite , the tail of the distribution decreases exponentially with growing (cid:21) . In the recent paper [ 193 ] , the eigenvalue spectrum of the BA model , that is , of the growing scale - free network with (cid:13) = 3 , was studied numerically ( see also Ref . [ 235 ] ) . A sharp di(cid:11)erence from classical random graphs was ob - served . It was found that its shape is very far from a semi - circle , and the tail of the spectrum is of a power law form ( compare with the observations for the Internet [ 5 ] , see Sec . V C 2 ) . 42 M . Scale - free trees Above we discussed two main construction procedures producing scale - free networks : the preferential linking mechanism for growing networks and a rather heuristic procedure of Molloy and Reed for equilibrium networks . In Ref . [ 97 ] , the ( grand canonical ) statistical ensemble of tree - like graphs was constructed , that is , an equilib - rium random tree - like graph . In the particular case of mean degree k = 2 , the procedure [ 97 ] yields scale - free trees with a (cid:13) exponent which takes values in the range ( 2 ; 1 ) . Cuto(cid:11)s of the degree distributions of these equi - librium networks were found to be at the same point k cut (cid:24) N 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) as for growing scale - free nets ( see Eq . ( 52 ) in Sec . IX D ) . Here N is the network size . In sharp contrast to the standard logarithmic depen - dence of the average shortest - path length ‘ on the net - work size , the constructed trees were found to have a quite di(cid:11)erent geometry with a power - law dependence ‘ / N 1 = d H . Here the fractal dimension d H = 2 for (cid:13) > 3 and d H = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 2 ) when 2 < (cid:13) < 3 . X . NON - SCALE - FREE NETWORKS WITH PREFERENTIAL LINKING A linear form of the preference function discussed in Sec . IX is only a very particular case . It is hard to believe that just this case is the most wide - spread in Na - ture . Moreover , recent empirical studies of collaboration networks in the scienti(cid:12)c literature [ 15 , 101 ] suggest that the preference function may be of a power - law form ( al - though in Ref . [ 103 ] , a linear attachment was observed in such networks ) . One can show that not only a linear of the preference function produces scale - free networks but all the prefer - ence functions that have linear asymptotes in the range of large values of degree [ 94 , 95 ] . Other preference func - tions do not provide scale - free networks . The case of a power - law preference function was explicitly considered in Refs . [ 94 , 95 ] . The continuum approach arguments for this situation can be found in Ref . [ 175 ] . In Refs . [ 94 , 95 ] , the extension of the BA model to the case of the preference function proportional to k y was studied . The results are the following . The situations with 0 < y < 1 and y > 1 di(cid:11)ers sharply one from each other . The case 0 < y < 1 is , in fact , describes crossover from the BA model ( linear preferential linking ) to the linking without preference ( y = 0 ) that produces expo - nential degree - distributions ( see Sec . VIII ) . The exact result for the stationary degree distribution [ 94 , 95 ] is P ( k ) / 8 > > > > > > > < > > > > > > > : k (cid:0) y exp h (cid:0) (cid:22) k 1 (cid:0) y (cid:0) 2 1 (cid:0) y 1 (cid:0) y i 12 < y < 1 ; k ( (cid:22) 2 (cid:0) 1 ) = 2 exp h (cid:0) 2 (cid:22) p k i y = 12 ; k (cid:0) y exp h (cid:0) (cid:22) k 1 (cid:0) y 1 (cid:0) y + (cid:22) 2 2 k 1 (cid:0) 2 y 1 (cid:0) 2 y i 13 < y < 12 ; : : : ( 94 ) Here , (cid:22) depends on y and varies from 1 when y = 0 to 2 for y = 1 . Near these points , (cid:22) ( y ) is linear : (cid:22) ( y ) (cid:0) 1 (cid:24) = 0 : 5078 y and 2 (cid:0) (cid:22) ( y ) (cid:24) = 2 : 407 ( 1 (cid:0) y ) . In the case of y > 1 , most of connections come to the oldest vertex . Furthermore , for y > 2 , there is a (cid:12) - nite probability that it is connected to all other vertices . For simplicity , let , at each increment of time , one ver - tex with one edge be added . Then , probability P ( t ) that the oldest vertex captures all edges satis(cid:12)es the relation : P ( t + 1 ) = P ( t ) t y = [ t (cid:1) 1 y + t y ] . Then , P ( t ! 1 ) = 1 Y t = 1 1 1 + t 1 (cid:0) y : ( 95 ) This probability is indeed nonzero when y > 2 . Applying the master equation approach to this net - work one can obtain the following results [ 94 , 95 ] . If y > 2 , all but a (cid:12)nite number of vertices are connected with the oldest vertex . For 1 < y < 2 , the oldest ver - tex is connected to almost every other vertex but various situations are possible for the distribution of edges . For ( j + 1 ) = j < y < j = ( j (cid:0) 1 ) , the number of vertices of degree k > j ( this number is equal to tP ( k > j ) ) is (cid:12)nite and grows as t k (cid:0) ( k (cid:0) 1 ) y < t 1 for k (cid:20) j . This just means that P ( k = 1 ; t ! 1 ) ! 1 , so practically all the vertices are of unit degree and almost all the connections are with the oldest vertex . It would be a mistake to presume that linear preferen - tial linking always provides scale - free networks networks ( or , more precisely , networks with power - law degree dis - tributions ) . We have to repeat that the growth producing power - law distributions is only a very particular situa - tion . In Refs . [ 187 , 188 ] , the idea of preferential linking [ 55 ] was combined with partial inheritance ( partial copy - ing ) of degree of individual vertices by new ones [ 194 , 195 ] . ( The papers [ 194 , 195 ] as well as Refs . [ 196 { 200 ] are de - voted to more complex models generically related to the biological evolution processes . ) As an illustrating example , the directed network in which the growth is governed by the same rule of pref - erential linking as in the BA model , was considered an - alytically . At each time step , apart from m new edges being distributed preferentially , some additional connec - tions emerge . This additional new edges are attached to a new vertex . This one is born with a random number of incoming edges which is distributed according to some distribution function P c ( q ; t ) depending on the state of the network at the birth time . In this rather general situation , the master equation looks like 43 t @ P ( q ; t ) @ t + P ( q ; t ) + m q ( t ) [ qP ( q ; t ) (cid:0) ( q (cid:0) 1 ) P ( q (cid:0) 1 ; t ) ] = P c ( q ; t ) ; ( 96 ) where q ( t ) is the average in - degree of the net at time t . One sees that the term (cid:14) q ; 0 on the right hand side of Eq . ( 25 ) from Sec . IX B is substituted by P c ( q t ) in Eq . ( 96 ) , so Eq . ( 96 ) is the direct generalization of Eq . ( 25 ) . If every new vertex is born by some randomly chosen old one , and at the moment of birth , it \ inherits " ( copies ) on average , a fraction c of its parent’s connectivity , the dis - tribution P c ( t ; q ) takes a speci(cid:12)c form which allows us to solve the problem explicitly . More precisely , with prob - ability c , each of q incoming edges of a \ parent " creates an edge attached to its heir , so that this copying is only partial . In particular , such type of \ inheritance " ( copy - ing ) produces nodes of zero degree which cannot get new connections . Hence , it is worth to consider only \ active " nodes of non - zero degree . The resulting network is not scale - free . One may check that its in - degree distribution is of a multifractal type . That means that moments of the distribution depend on network size in the following way : M n ( t ) (cid:24) t (cid:28) ( n ) where (cid:28) ( n ) is a non - linear function of n . Therefore , special attention must be paid to temporal evolution of the in - degree distribution . If , for example , c is a random number distributed ho - mogeneously within the interval ( 0 ; 1 ) , and the evolution of the network starts from the distribution P ( q ; t 0 (cid:29) 1 ) = (cid:14) q ; q 0 , then in - degree distribution P 1 ( q ; t ) of the ver - tices of non - zero degree is of the form P 1 ( t ; q ) = d 1 t (cid:0)p 2 ln ( d 2 q ) exp [ p 2 ln t ln ( t = q 2 ) ] : ( 97 ) Here , 1 (cid:28) q (cid:28) q 0 p t , d 1 = 0 : 174 : : : , and d 2 = 0 : 840 : : : . For t ! 1 , Eq . ( 96 ) takes the stationary form P 1 ( q ) = d 1 q p 2 ln ( d 2 q ) : ( 98 ) One may check that , in this case , (cid:28) ( n ) is indeed non - linear , (cid:28) ( n ) = n = 2 (cid:0) n ( n + 1 ) , and the distribution is multifractal . One should note that the nature of the new term in Eq . ( 96 ) is rather general , and such e(cid:11)ects should exist in various real networks . Unfortunately , as far as we know , no checks for multifractality of real degree distributions were made yet . In fact , the quality of the existing experi - mental material ( see Sec . V ) does not let one to separate power - law and multifractal behaviors . It is quite possi - ble , that what is often reported as a power - law degree distribution is in fact a multifractal one . The situation may be similar to the one in the (cid:12)eld of the self - organized criticality where numerous distributions (cid:12)rst perceived as pure power - law dependences , now are treated as multi - fractal functions . Recently , a multifractal degree distribution was ob - tained in a model describing the evolution of protein - protein interaction networks [ 189 ] . XI . PERCOLATION ON NETWORKS Rigorously speaking , percolation is a phenomenon de - termined for structures with well - de(cid:12)ned metric struc - ture , like , e . g . , regular lattices . In case of networks , where it is hard to introduce metric coordinates , one can speak about the emergence of a giant component . In physi - cal literature , a phenomenon related to the emergence of a giant component in networks is usually called percola - tion , and the phase transition of the emergence of a giant component is called a percolation threshold [ 61 , 81 , 82 ] . We follow this tradition . If the giant component is absent , the network is only a set of small clusters , so that the study of this charac - teristic is of primary importance . For regular lattices , to observe the percolation phenomenon , one must remove a fraction of sites or bonds . In case of networks it is not necessary to delete vertices or edges to eliminate their giant components . For instance , one can approach the percolation threshold changing the degree distribution of a network . One should note that percolation phenomena in equi - librium and evolving ( growing ) networks are of di(cid:11)erent nature , so hereafter we consider them separately . Fur - thermore , the existing percolation theory for equilibrium networks [ 61 ] and its generalizations are valid only for speci(cid:12)c graphs constructed by the Molloy - Reed proce - dure ( see Sec . IV ) . Also , inasmuch as giant components are discussed , we stress that networks must be large . A . Theory of percolation on undirected equilibrium networks Very important results on percolation on random net - works with arbitrary degree distributions and random connections are due to Molloy and Reed [ 81 , 82 ] . They were subsequently developed in papers [ 61 , 62 , 147 , 163 ] , and the problem was brought to the level of physical clarity . Here , we dwell on the latter e(cid:14)cient approach for equilibrium networks constructed by the Molloy - Reed procedure . The generating function ( or the Z - transform ) appara - tus is used extensively in modern graph theory [ 76 ] . The Z - transform of the degree distribution is de(cid:12)ned as (cid:8) ( y ) = 1 X k = 0 P ( k ) y k ; ( 99 ) where j y j (cid:20) 1 . Obviously , (cid:8) ( 1 ) = 1 . For example , for the Poisson distribution ( see Eq . ( 5 ) in Sec . VI ) , this yields the Z - transform (cid:8) ( y ) = exp [ z 1 ( y (cid:0) 1 ) ] , where z 1 (cid:17) k is the average degree of a vertex , i . e . , the average number of the nearest neighbors . The inverse Z - transform is 44 P ( k ) = 1 k ! d k (cid:8) ( y ) dy k (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) y = 0 = 1 2 (cid:25)i I C dy (cid:8) ( y ) y k + 1 ; ( 100 ) where C is a contour around 0 which does not enclose singularities of (cid:8) ( y ) . Moments of the distribution can be easily obtained from the Z - transform : k n = (cid:20)(cid:18) y d dy (cid:19) n (cid:8) ( y ) (cid:21) y = 1 : ( 101 ) In particular , the number of the nearest neighbors is z 1 (cid:17) k = (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) ( naturally , z 0 = 1 ) . This technique is especially convenient for the descrip - tion of branching processes and trees . Let us outline the key points of the calculations . One can study the percola - tion by \ infecting " a random vertex and considering the process of the infection spreading step by step . Let this vertex belong to some connected component . At the (cid:12)rst step , the nearest neighbors will be infected , at the second { the second neighbors , etc . until the step at which all the connected component will be infected . The (cid:12)rst thing we should know is the following . Sup - pose that we randomly choose an edge in the network . It connects two vertices . Each of them may have some ex - tra edges being attached . How do edges breed ( multiply ) at ends of the randomly chosen edge ? To know this , one should calculate the degree distribution for an end vertex ( either of the two ) of the edge . This distribution is equal to kP ( k ) = P k kP ( k ) . Indeed , the edge is attached to a vertex with probability proportional to its degree k , and the degree distribution of vertices is P ( k ) . The denomi - nator ensures proper normalization . Z - transform of the resulting distribution is P k kP ( k ) y k P k kP ( k ) = y (cid:8) 0 ( y ) (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) = y (cid:8) 0 ( y ) z 1 (cid:17) y (cid:8) 1 ( y ) : ( 102 ) Meanwhile , one sees that the probability that a ran - domly chosen edge of such a graph connects vertices of degrees k and k 0 is P ( k ; k 0 ) = kP ( k ) k 0 P ( k 0 ) [ P k kP ( k ) ] 2 ( 103 ) ( compare with the corresponding distribution ( 84 ) for growing networks ) . Actually , one needs a slightly di(cid:11)erent distribution than Eq . ( 102 ) . We have to know the distribution of the number of connections minus one for either of the two end vertices of a randomly chosen edge since we do not want to account for the original edge itself . This probability equals ( k + 1 ) P ( k + 1 ) = P k ( k + 1 ) P ( k + 1 ) , so one immediately gets the corresponding Z - transform : (cid:8) 1 ( y ) = (cid:8) 0 ( y ) (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) = (cid:8) 0 ( y ) z 1 : ( 104 ) Note that (cid:8) 1 ( 1 ) = 1 . Let us start from a randomly chosen vertex and look how the numbers of its second - nearest neighbors are dis - tributed . We recall that the network is large and its ver - tices are statistically uncorrelated ( i . e . connections are random ) , so , in particular , one can neglect connections between the nearest neighbors . Moreover , one should state that if such a network is in(cid:12)nitely large , then al - most each of its connected components has a tree - like structure . The results that we discuss are based on this key statement . Then , one can see that the Z - transform of the number of the second neighbors of a vertex is X k P ( k ) [ (cid:8) 1 ( y ) ] k = (cid:8) ( (cid:8) 1 ( y ) ) : ( 105 ) Indeed , the reason to write P ( k ) in the sum is obvious : it is the probability that the original vertex has k edges . To understand the [ (cid:8) 1 ( y ) ] k factor , one should know the following property of Z - transform . If (cid:9) ( y ) is the Z - transform of the distribution of values of some quantity X of a system , then [ (cid:9) ( y ) ] m is the Z - transform of the distri - bution of the sum P mi = 1 X i of the values of this quantity observed in m independent realizations of the system . At this point we use the basic assumption that vertices of the network are statistically uncorrelated . From this and Eq . ( 104 ) , the form of Eq . ( 105 ) follows immedi - ately . Proceeding in this way , one gets the Z - transform of the distribution of numbers of third - nearest neighbors , (cid:8) ( (cid:8) 1 ( (cid:8) 1 ( y ) ) ) ( we have again used the tree - like structure of the network ) , etc . Eqs . ( 102 ) - ( 105 ) are the basic relations of this ap - proach . From Eqs . ( 101 ) and ( 105 ) , one gets the average number of second - nearest neighbors of a vertex , z 2 = (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) (cid:8) 0 1 ( 1 ) = z 1 (cid:8) 0 1 ( 1 ) = X k k ( k (cid:0) 1 ) P ( k ) : ( 106 ) Using the above Z - transform of the distribution of num - ber of m - th - nearest neighbors and Eq . ( 101 ) , one readily obtains z m = [ (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) ] m (cid:0) 1 (cid:8) 0 1 ( 1 ) = (cid:20) z 2 z 1 (cid:21) m (cid:0) 1 z 1 : ( 107 ) We see that z m is completely determined by z 1 and z 2 . If the giant connected component spans almost surely all of the network , the typical shortest path between a pair of randomly chosen vertices may be estimated from the condition , P ‘m = 0 z m (cid:24) N . Substituting Eq . ( 107 ) into this condition and assuming N (cid:29) z 1 ; z 2 , one obtains [ 61 ] ‘ (cid:25) ln ( N = z 1 ) + ln [ ( z 2 (cid:0) z 1 ) = z 1 ] ln ( z 2 = z 1 ) : ( 108 ) This relation improves on the classical estimate of the typical shortest path written in Sec . III B . If the frac - tion S of the network occupied by the giant connected component is less than one , one may try to improve the estimation by replacing N ! NS in Eq . ( 108 ) [ 61 ] . Note that Eq . ( 108 ) is of a general nature . It contains only 45 the local characteristics of the network , the numbers of the (cid:12)rst and second nearest neighbors , z 1 and z 2 . One should stress that Eq . ( 108 ) is an estimate . Fur - thermore , an obvious problem occurs when (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 , when the mean number of second neighbors , z 2 , diverges ( see Eq . ( 106 ) ) as N ! 1 . Indeed , let us try to estimate ‘ from below in this \ dangerous " region just using Eq . ( 108 ) . When 2 < (cid:13) < 3 , accounting for the degree - distribution cut - o(cid:11) position k cut (cid:24) N 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) ( see Sec . IX D ) , we get z 2 (cid:24) R k cut k 2 k (cid:0) (cid:13) (cid:24) N ( 3 (cid:0) (cid:13) ) = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) . Substi - tuting this relation into Eq . ( 108 ) gives the (cid:12)nite value ‘ & ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) = ( 3 (cid:0) (cid:13) ) + 1 = 2 = ( 3 (cid:0) (cid:13) ) in the large net - work limit ( note that another estimate was recently made in Ref . [ 201 ] ) . The last equation demonstrates that the above approach ( the tree ansatz ) fails when (cid:13) < 3 but may also be considered as a very rough estimate from below for ‘ . Let us consider the distribution of the sizes of con - nected components of the networks . It is convenient to introduce the distribution of the sizes of components which are reachable if we start from a randomly cho - sen edge and move through one of its ends . Let its Z - transform be H 1 ( y ) . In Refs . [ 61 ] , following important equation was obtained for it , H 1 ( y ) = y (cid:8) 1 ( H 1 ( y ) ) : ( 109 ) The tree - like structure of large networks under consider - ation was again used . In this situation , the probability to reach some connected component moving in such a way is equal to the sum of probabilities ( i ) that there is only a single vertex , i . e . , the dead end , ( ii ) that this vertex has one extra edge leading to another component , ( iii ) that it has two extra edges leading to two other components , and so on . Accounting for this structure and for the al - ready used property of powers of Z - transform , one gets Eq . ( 109 ) ( compare it with the basic Eq . ( 102 ) ) . Now one can easily write the expression for the Z - transform of the distribution of sizes of connected components , that is , the components reachable starting from a randomly chosen vertex . Practically repeating the derivation of Eq . ( 105 ) , one obtains [ 61 ] H ( y ) = y (cid:8) ( H 1 ( y ) ) : ( 110 ) The factor y appears here , since the starting vertex also belongs to the connected component . From Eqs . ( 109 ) and ( 110 ) , using Eqs . ( 99 ) and ( 100 ) , we can (cid:12)nd the distribution that we discuss . It is easy to (cid:12)nd the average connected component size s . From Eq . ( 110 ) , it follows that s = H 0 ( 1 ) = 1 + (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) H 0 1 ( 1 ) : ( 111 ) H 0 1 ( 1 ) can be obtained from Eq . ( 109 ) , H 0 1 ( 1 ) = 1 + (cid:8) 0 1 ( 1 ) H 0 1 ( 1 ) ; ( 112 ) so s = 1 + (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) 1 (cid:0) (cid:8) 0 1 ( 1 ) : ( 113 ) From this , one sees that the giant connected component exists when (cid:8) 0 1 ( 1 ) > 1 ; ( 114 ) that is , when (cid:8) 00 ( 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) > 0 ; ( 115 ) or , equivalently , when X k k ( k (cid:0) 2 ) P ( k ) = k 2 (cid:0) 2 k > 0 : ( 116 ) The average size of connected components turns out to be in(cid:12)nite and the giant connected component emerges when P k k ( k (cid:0) 2 ) P ( k ) = 0 . Accounting for expression ( 106 ) for z 2 we see that the giant connected component is present when average number of second nearest neighbors is greater than the average number of nearest neighbors , z 2 > z 1 : ( 117 ) This strong result is due to Molloy and Reed [ 81 , 82 ] and derived above following Refs . [ 61 , 163 ] ( heuristic ar - guments leading to Eq . ( 116 ) may be found in Ref . [ 60 ] ) . It has several important consequences . In particular , from Eq . ( 116 ) , it follows that the giant connected com - ponent is present when P k = 3 k ( k (cid:0) 2 ) P ( k ) > P ( 1 ) ( the case P ( 2 ) = 1 is special since just in this situation the network has no tree - like structure ) . Isolated vertices do not in(cid:13)uence the existence of the giant connected com - ponent . Then , if P ( 1 ) = 0 , the giant component exists when P k (cid:21) 3 P ( k ) > 0 . We see that dead ends are of primary importance for the existence of the giant com - ponent . Indeed , only the term with P ( 1 ) in Eq . ( 116 ) prevents the giant connected component . If the giant component exists , the resulting relations are the same , equations ( 109 ) and ( 110 ) , but now H ( y ) corresponds to the distribution of the sizes of connected components of the network excluding the giant compo - nent , so H ( 1 ) = 1 (cid:0) W , where W is the relative size of the giant connected component . Then , from Eqs . ( 109 ) and ( 110 ) , one sees [ 61 ] that 1 (cid:0) W = (cid:8) ( t c ) ; ( 118 ) where t c is the smallest real non - negative solution of t c = (cid:8) 1 ( t c ) : ( 119 ) Notice that the e(cid:11)ect of isolated vertices is trivial . They produce the natural addendum P ( 0 ) on the right hand part of Eq . ( 118 ) , and this is all . Also , the iso - lated vertices do not in(cid:13)uence the existence of the gi - ant component . Therefore , we can exclude these nodes from consideration and set P ( 0 ) = 0 . Then , from Eqs . 46 ( 118 ) and ( 119 ) , we immediately see that the absence of dead ends , i . e . , P ( 1 ) = 0 , is su(cid:14)cient for W = 1 . ( Note again that it should be P ( 2 ) < 1 . ) Indeed , in this case , (cid:8) 1 ( 0 ) / (cid:8) 0 ( 0 ) = 0 , so t c = 0 and W = 1 . If P ( 1 ) > 0 , usually W < 1 . It seems , there exists a situation [ 61 ] , in which W = 1 , even if P ( 1 ) > 0 . Let the degree distribution be of a power - law form , P ( k ) / k (cid:0) (cid:13) ; k (cid:21) 1 with exponent (cid:13) (cid:20) 2 . Then its (cid:12)rst moment k (cid:17) z 1 = (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) = P 1 k = 1 kk (cid:0) (cid:13) diverges . This means that (cid:8) 1 ( y < 1 ) = 0 , and Eq . ( 119 ) has the solution t c = 0 . Therefore , this case provides W = 1 . We should warn , however , that , formally speaking , the tree ansatz , which is the basis for the above conclusions , is not applicable in this situation . Notice that degree dis - tributions with (cid:13) (cid:20) 2 lead to the divergence of the (cid:12)rst moment , so the number of edges in such nets grows faster than the number of vertices as the network size increases ( see Sec . IX J ) . From Eqs . ( 118 ) and ( 119 ) , the size of the giant con - nected component of the classical random graph of Erd(cid:127)os and R(cid:19)enyi can be easily found . We have seen that its Poisson degree distribution produces (cid:8) ( y ) = e z 1 ( y (cid:0) 1 ) . Then 1 (cid:0) W = e (cid:0) z 1 W . Hence the giant connected compo - nent of such a network exists if its average degree exceeds one [ 74 ] . From Eqs . ( 109 ) and ( 110 ) , one can understand the analytical properties of H ( y ) and H 1 ( y ) near the per - colation threshold . The analytical structure of H ( y ) , in turn , determines the asymptotic form of the size distribu - tion of connected components . Substituting the inverse of r = H 1 ( y ) , i . e . , y = H (cid:0) 1 1 ( r ) , into Eq . ( 109 ) , we get y = r = (cid:8) 1 ( r ) : ( 120 ) The derivative of dy ( r ) = dr is zero at the point of singu - larity of H 1 ( y ) , y (cid:3) . This one is , as one can (cid:12)nd from Eq . ( 120 ) , at the point r (cid:3) which is determined from the equation (cid:8) ( r (cid:3) ) (cid:0) r (cid:3) (cid:8) 1 ( r (cid:3) ) = 0 : ( 121 ) At the percolation threshold , where the giant connected component emerges , (cid:8) 1 ( 1 ) = 1 . Accounting , in addition , for the equality (cid:8) ( 1 ) = 1 , one sees that , at the percola - tion threshold , r (cid:3) = 1 . Then , it follows from Eq . ( 120 ) that , in this situation , the singularity of H 1 ( y ) reaches y (cid:3) = 1 . At the percolation threshold , it is easy to expand y ( r ) about r (cid:3) = 1 using Eq . ( 120 ) . This gives y [ 1 + ( r (cid:0) 1 ) ] (cid:24) = 1 + 0 (cid:0) (cid:8) 00 ( 1 ) ( r (cid:0) 1 ) 2 = 2 . If (cid:8) 00 ( 1 ) 6 = 0 , that is not true only for very special distributions , one gets r = H 1 ( y ) (cid:24) = 1 + ( 1 (cid:0) y ) 1 = 2 near y (cid:3) = 1 . Equation ( 110 ) shows that this singularity in H 1 ( y ) coincides with the one in H ( y ) since (cid:8) 1 ( y ) has no sin - gularities for y (cid:20) 1 . Then , at the percolation threshold , near y (cid:3) = 1 , H ( y ) looks as H ( y ) (cid:24) = C 1 + C 2 ( 1 (cid:0) y ) 1 = 2 ; ( 122 ) where C 1 and C 2 are constants . Knowing the analytical structure of H ( y ) at the percolation threshold , and using the properties of the Z - transform ( recall that a power - law function w (cid:0) b , as w ! 1 , yields the Z - transform of the form C 3 + C 4 ( 1 (cid:0) y ) b (cid:0) 1 + analytical terms near y = 1 , where C 3 and C 4 are constants ) , one can restore the structure of the distribution P s ( w ) of sizes of the connected components in the network near this point . It looks like [ 61 ] P s ( w ) (cid:24) w (cid:0) 3 = 2 e (cid:0) w = w (cid:3) ; ( 123 ) where w (cid:3) = 1 = ln j y (cid:3) j , y (cid:3) is the point of the singularity in H ( y ) closest to the origin that is just the singularity that we discussed above . Near the percolation threshold , y (cid:3) is close to 1 . The values of w (cid:3) and y (cid:3) depend on a partic - ular form of the degree - distribution . The exponent 3 = 2 is the same for all reasonable degree distributions . This value is quite natural . Indeed , at the threshold point the average size of connected components diverges , so this exponent cannot be greater than 2 . We emphasize that Eq . ( 123 ) is valid only near the percolation threshold . The power - law form P s ( w ) (cid:24) w (cid:0) 3 = 2 of the size dis - tribution for connected components at the percolation threshold point corresponds to the form P ( w ) (cid:24) w (cid:0) 5 = 2 for the probability that randomly chosen vertex belongs to a (cid:12)nite connected component of size w . The lat - ter probability is a basic quantity in percolation theory . From this form , using standard arguments of percolation theory , one (cid:12)nds that if the giant component is absent , the largest connected component has size of the order of N 2 = 3 ( near the percolation threshold ) . Here N is the size of the network . In this situation , the size of the sec - ond largest connected component is of the order of ln N . Also , one can prove that , if the giant connected compo - nent exists and (cid:13) > 2 , the sizes of all other connected components are of the order of ln N or less [ 32 ] . In principle , the outlined theory , allows one to compute the main statistical properties of these equilibrium net - works . Analytical calculations are possible only for the simplest degree distributions but numerics is easily appli - cable [ 61 ] . The results may be also checked by simulation using , e . g . , e(cid:14)cient algorithm for percolation problems [ 202 ] . In the same paper [ 61 ] , one can (cid:12)nd another general - ization of this theory to the case of undirected bipartite graphs ( see Fig . 3 in Sec . V B ) . The bipartite graphs in which connections are present only between vertices of di(cid:11)erent kinds were considered . Such networks , in par - ticular , describe collaborations ( see Sec . V B ) . The pro - posed theory describes percolation on these networks . In addition , it allows one to calculate the degree distribu - tion of the one - mode projection of the bipartite graph from two degree distributions of its vertices of di(cid:11)erent kinds . These relations were checked using data on real 47 collaboration graphs , of the Fortune 1000 , movie actors , collaborations in physics , etc . For example , from the data for the network of the members of the boards of direc - tors of the Fortune 1000 companies , the distribution of the numbers of boards on which a director sits and the distribution of the numbers of directors on boards were extracted . From these two distributions , the distribution of the total numbers of co - directors for each director was calculated . The result turned to be very close to the corresponding empirical distribution of the co - directors . B . Percolation on directed equilibrium networks This theory can be generalized to equilibrium directed networks with statistically uncorrelated vertices [ 61 , 112 ] ( see Fig . 6 and Sec . V C 2 , where the de(cid:12)nitions of a giant strongly connected component ( GSCC ) , a giant weakly connected component ( GWCC ) , and giant in - and out - components ( GIN and GOUT ) were given ) . In this case , it is natural to consider the joint in - and out - degree dis - tribution P ( k i ; k o ) and its Z - transform (cid:8) ( x ; y ) (cid:17) X k i ; k o P ( k i ; k o ) x k i y k o : ( 124 ) If all the connections are inside of the network the av - erage in - and out - degrees are equal ( see Eq . ( 2 ) in Sec . III A ) : @ x (cid:8) ( x ; 1 ) j x = 1 = @ y (cid:8) ( 1 ; y ) j y = 1 (cid:17) z ( d ) = z 1 = 2 , where z 1 is the mean degree of the network . Z - transform of the degree distribution is (cid:8) ( w ) ( x ) = (cid:8) ( x ; x ) . Using Eqs . ( 118 ) and ( 119 ) , from (cid:8) ( w ) ( x ) , one gets the relative size W of the GWCC . The sizes of the GIN and GOUT can be obtained in the framework of the following rigorous procedure [ 61 ] . One introduces the Z - transform of the out - degree distribution of the vertex approachable by following a randomly chosen edge when one moves along the edge direction , (cid:8) ( o ) 1 ( y ) (cid:17) @ x (cid:8) ( x ; y ) j x = 1 = z ( d ) . Also , (cid:8) ( i ) 1 ( x ) (cid:17) @ y (cid:8) ( x ; y ) j y = 1 = z ( d ) corresponds to the in - degree distribution of the vertex which one can ap - proach moving against the edge direction . The GIN and GOUT are present if (cid:8) ( i ) 0 1 ( 1 ) = (cid:8) ( o ) 0 1 ( 1 ) = @ 2 xy (cid:8) ( x ; y ) j x = 1 ; y = 1 = z ( d ) > 1 , i . e . when X k i ; k o ( 2 k i k o (cid:0) k i (cid:0) k o ) P ( k i ; k o ) = 2 X k i ; k o k i ( k o (cid:0) 1 ) P ( k i ; k o ) = 2 X k i ; k o k o ( k i (cid:0) 1 ) P ( k i ; k o ) > 0 ( 125 ) | the generalization of Eq . ( 116 ) . This is also the con - dition for the existence of the GSCC . In this case , there exist non - trivial solutions of the equations x c = (cid:8) ( i ) 1 ( x c ) ; y c = (cid:8) ( o ) 1 ( y c ) : ( 126 ) They have the following meaning . x c < 1 is the proba - bility that the connected component , obtained by mov - ing against the edge directions starting from a randomly chosen edge , is (cid:12)nite . y c < 1 is the probability that the connected component , obtained by moving along the edge directions starting from a randomly chosen edge , is (cid:12)nite . The expressions for the relative sizes of the GIN , I , and GOUT , O , have the form [ 61 ] I = 1 (cid:0) (cid:8) ( x c ; 1 ) ; O = 1 (cid:0) (cid:8) ( 1 ; y c ) : ( 127 ) Recall that , in our de(cid:12)nition , the GSCC is the inter - ception of GIN and GOUT . Accounting for the meaning of x c and y c , we can (cid:12)nd exactly the relative size of the GSCC ( see the derivation in Ref . [ 112 ] ) : S = X k i ; k o P ( k i ; k o ) ( 1 (cid:0) x k i c ) ( 1 (cid:0) y k o c ) = 1 (cid:0) (cid:8) ( x c ; 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:8) ( 1 ; y c ) + (cid:8) ( x c ; y c ) : ( 128 ) Furthermore , knowing W , S , I , and O , it is easy to ob - tain the relative size of tendrils , T = W + S (cid:0) I (cid:0) O : ( 129 ) Equations ( 118 ) , ( 119 ) , and ( 126 ) - ( 129 ) allow us to ob - tain exactly the relative sizes of all the giant components of equilibrium directed networks with arbitrary joint in - and out - degree distributions , if their vertices are statis - tically uncorrelated . It is useful to rewrite Eq . ( 128 ) in the form S = IO + (cid:8) ( x c ; y c ) (cid:0) (cid:8) ( x c ; 1 ) (cid:8) ( 1 ; y c ) : ( 130 ) If the joint distribution of in - and out - degrees factorizes , P ( k i ; k o ) = P i ( k i ) P o ( k o ) , Eq . ( 130 ) takes the simple form S = IO . Here , P i ( k i ) is the in - degree distribution of the network , and P o ( k o ) is the out - degree distribu - tion . Otherwise , such factorization of S is impossible . At the point of the emergence of GIN , GOUT , and GSCC , x c = y c = 1 , and I , O , and S simultaneously approach zero . 48 N ET TE ND R I L S G I N GOU T G S CC G W CC control parameter N ET control parameter b ) a ) G CC D C FIG . 38 . Schematic plots of the variations of all the giant components vs . some control parameter for the undirected equilibrium network ( a ) and for the directed equilibrium one ( b ) . In the undirected graph , the meanings of the giant con - nected component ( GCC ) , i . e . , its percolating cluster , and the GWCC coincide . Near the point of the emergence of the GWCC , its size is a linear function of the control parame - ter . Near the point of the emergence of the GSCC , GIN , and GOUT , the sizes of the giant in - and out - components linearly varies with the control parameter , and the size of the giant strongly connected component is a quadratic function of the deviation of the control parameter from this point . Variations of the giant components of equilibrium di - rected networks with some control parameter were stud - ied in Ref . [ 112 ] ( see Fig . 38 ) . I and O approach the point of the emergence of the GSCC in a linear fashion , and S a quadratic function of the deviation of the control parameter from its critical value . Not pretending to apply this theory for equilib - rium networks to the WWW , which is certainly non - equilibrium ( growing ) , we recall the relative sizes of the giant components of the WWW . From the data of Ref . [ 6 ] ( see Sec . V C 2 ) , in the WWW , I (cid:25) O (cid:25) 0 : 490 , so IO (cid:25) 0 : 240 , that is , less than that measured in Ref . [ 6 ] S (cid:25) 0 : 277 but is not far from it . An attempt was made to model the WWW using the measured in - and out - degree distributions and estimate the sizes of these components [ 61 ] but the result turned out to be far from reality . The main point of the discrep - ancy was the following . The reasonable values of param - eters of the model network , used in the calculation , ( in particular , the reasonable fraction of vertices with zero out - degree ) produce a huge di(cid:11)erence between the sizes of the giant in - and out - components unlike nearly equal in - and out - components of the WWW ( see Sec . V C 2 ) . The authors of the paper [ 61 ] ascribed this discrepancy to the approximation P ( k i ; k o ) (cid:25) P i ( k i ) P o ( k o ) which they used in their calculations , so the correlations between in - and out - degree of vertices discussed in Sec . IX F were not ac - counted for . We may add that the equilibrium nets with statistically uncorrelated vertices , which we consider in this section , are far from the WWW whose growth pro - duces strong correlations between its vertices . C . Failures and attacks The e(cid:11)ect of random damage and attack on commu - nications networks ( WWW and Internet ) was simulated by Albert , Jeong , and Barab(cid:19)asi [ 59 ] . In their simulations , they used : ( i ) the real sample of the WWW containing 325 729 vertices and 1 498 353 links , ( ii ) the existing map of the Internet containing 6 209 vertices and 24 401 links , ( iii ) the model for a scale - free network with the (cid:13) ex - ponent equal 3 ( the BA model ) , and ( iv ) for comparison , the exponential growing network [ 55 , 56 ] ( see Sec . VIII ) . One should again stress that all these growing networks di(cid:11)er from the equilibrium networks considered in Secs . XI A and XI B . Edges between their vertices are dis - tributed in a di(cid:11)erent manner because of their growth ( see Sec . IX I ) . Recall that the networks ( i ) and ( ii ) have the (cid:13) exponents in the range between 2 and 3 . Failures ( random damage ) were modeled by the instant removal of a fraction of randomly chosen vertices . The intentional damage ( attack ) was described by the instant deletion of a fraction of vertices with the highest num - bers of connections ( degree ) . The networks were grown and then were instantly damaged . In these simulations , the networks were treated as undirected . The following quantities were measured as functions of the fraction f of deleted vertices : ( i ) the average shortest path ‘ between randomly cho - sen vertices of the network , ( ii ) the relative size S of the largest connected compo - nent ( corresponds to the giant connected component if it exists ) , and ( iii ) the average size s of connected components ( ex - cluding the giant connected one ) . A striking di(cid:11)erence between the scale - free networks and the exponential one was observed . Whereas the ex - ponential network produces the same dependences ‘ ( f ) , S ( f ) , and s ( f ) for both kinds of damage , for all scale - free 49 nets which are discussed here , these curves are distinct for di(cid:11)erent types of damage . The qualitative e(cid:11)ect of the intentional damage was more or less the same for all four networks ( see Fig . 39 ) . The average shortest path rapidly grows with growing f , the size of the giant con - nected component turns to be zero at some point f c in - dicating the percolation threshold , S ( f c ) = 0 . Near this point , S ( f ) / ( f c (cid:0) f ) as in the mean - (cid:12)eld theory of per - colation . At f c , s diverges . Hence , the behavior is usual for the mean - (cid:12)eld ( or in(cid:12)nitely dimensional ) percolation and for the percolation in the classical random graphs . Nevertheless , one general distinct feature of these scale - free nets should be emphasized . The value f c in them is anomalously low { several percents , unlike the percola - tion threshold of the exponential networks , so that such nets are very sensitive to intentional damage . f c f c f c f c f c f c Exponential Scale−free l s l s 1 1 1 1 1 1 S S 0 0 0 0 0 f f f f f f 1 1 1 00 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 FIG . 39 . Schematic plots of the e(cid:11)ect of intentional and random damage ( attack and failures ) on the characteristics of exponential undirected networks and scale - free undirected ones with exponent (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 [ 59 ] . The average shortest path be - tween vertices , ‘ , the size of the largest connected component , S , and the average size of isolated clusters , s are plotted vs . the fraction of removed vertices f (cid:17) 1 (cid:0) p . The networks are large . The solid lines show the e(cid:11)ect of the random damage . The e(cid:11)ect of the intentional damage is shown by the dashed lines . For the exponential networks , both kinds of damage produce the same dependences . For the scale - free networks with (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 , in the event of the random damage , the percola - tion threshold is at the point f ! 1 . The main observation of Ref . [ 59 ] is that the random damage has far less pronounced e(cid:11)ect on the scale - free nets than the intentional one . The variations of the av - erage shortest distance with f are hardly visible . The size of the giant strongly connected component decreases slowly until it disappears in the vicinity of f = 1 . s ( f ) grows smoothly with growing f without visible signs of singularity . This means that these scale - free networks are extremely resilient to random damage . To destroy them acting in such away , that is , to eliminate their giant con - nected component and to disintegrate them to a set of uncoupled clusters , it is necessary to delete practically all their vertices ! Similar observations were made for scale - free networks of metabolic reactions [ 41 ] , protein networks [ 44 ] and food webs [ 49 ] . The e(cid:11)ect of the attack on the scale - free networks seems rather natural since vertices of the highest degree determine the structure of these nets , but the vitally im - portant resilience against failures needs detailed expla - nation . Several recent papers have been devoted to the study of this intriguing problem . D . Resilience against random breakdowns As we saw in Sec . XI C , the random breakdowns ( fail - ures ) of networks more or less correspond to the classical site percolation problem , i . e . , a vertex of the network is present with probability p = 1 (cid:0) f , and one has to study how properties of the network vary with changing p . Now we have at hand the controlling parameter p to approach the percolation threshold . This parameter can be easily inserted into the general relations of Sec . XI A . The (cid:12)rst calculations of the threshold for failures in scale - free networks belong to Cohen , Erez , ben - Avraham , and Havlin [ 60 ] . Here , for logical presentation , we start with the considerations based on the approach of Call - away , Newman , Strogatz , and Watts [ 62 ] . Let us look , how Eqs . ( 109 ) and ( 110 ) ( for undirected equilibrium networks ) are modi(cid:12)ed when each vertex of a network is present with probability p ( site percolation ) . Let P ( k ) be the degree distribution for the original ( i . e . undamaged or virgin ) network with p = 1 . Again , to (cid:12)nd H 1 ( y ) , we have to start from a randomly chosen edge , but now we start from a randomly chosen edge of the original network with p = 1 , so it may be absent when p < 1 . Hence we must account for probability 1 (cid:0) p that the very (cid:12)rst vertex ( the vertex at the end of the edges ) is absent . This produces the term ( 1 (cid:0) p ) y 0 in H 1 ( y ) . Then , we can pass through this point with the probability p , so the equation for H 1 ( y ) takes the form H 1 ( y ) = 1 (cid:0) p + py (cid:8) 1 ( H 1 ( y ) ) : ( 131 ) Similarly , while calculating H ( y ) , we start from a ran - domly chosen vertex of the original network with p = 1 , which is absent in the network under consideration with 50 the probability 1 (cid:0) p . Hence we obtain the additional term 1 (cid:0) p in H ( y ) and must multiply the remaining con - tribution ( see Eq . ( 110 ) ) by p . Therefore , H ( y ) = 1 (cid:0) p + py (cid:8) ( H 1 ( y ) ) : ( 132 ) This pair of equations [ 62 ] actually solves the site per - colation problem for networks with random connections . In the event of bond percolation , i . e . , when an edge is present with the probability p , the form of Eq . ( 131 ) does not change ( just follow the justi(cid:12)cation of Eq . ( 131 ) above ) . Nevertheless , in this case , the equation for H ( y ) di(cid:11)ers from Eq . ( 132 ) . Indeed , in the bond percola - tion problem , all vertices are present , so when we start from a randomly chosen vertex , we can repeat the argu - ments leading to Eq . ( 110 ) of Sec . XI A . Then , again H ( y ) = y (cid:8) ( H 1 ( y ) ) . For site percolation , proceeding in the way outlined in Sec . XI A , one gets from Eqs . ( 131 ) and ( 132 ) the fol - lowing expression for the average size of the connected component above the percolation threshold : s = H 0 ( y ) = p (cid:18) 1 + p (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) 1 (cid:0) p (cid:8) 0 1 ( 1 ) (cid:19) : ( 133 ) For bond percolation , it looks like s = (cid:18) 1 + p (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) 1 (cid:0) p (cid:8) 0 1 ( 1 ) (cid:19) : ( 134 ) Therefore , the criterion for the existence of the giant connected component now becomes (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) > 1 = p , i . e . , p (cid:8) 00 ( 1 ) (cid:0) (cid:8) 0 ( 1 ) > 0 , for both ( ! ) site and bond perco - lation . Now , instead of the criterion of Molloy and Reed ( 116 ) , one has [ 60 , 62 ] X k k (cid:18) k (cid:0) 1 + p p (cid:19) P ( k ) = k 2 (cid:0) 1 + p p k > 0 ( 135 ) for both site and bond percolation . We again emphasize that , here , P ( k ) is the degree distribution of the virgin network with p = 1 , and k and k 2 are the average de - gree and the second moment for the virgin ( undamaged ) network again . If we take the distribution ~ P ( k ) of the network with removed vertices or edges , we must use the original relations of Sec . XI A . Criterion ( 135 ) may be rewritten in the form : p z 2 > z 1 ; ( 136 ) where z 1 and z 2 are the average numbers of the (cid:12)rst and second nearest neighbors in the virgin undamaged net - work , respectively . Compare Eq . ( 136 ) with Eq . ( 117 ) . Hence the percolation thresholds for both site and bond problems are at the same point , p c = 1 ( k 2 = k ) (cid:0) 1 = z 1 z 2 ; ( 137 ) Notice the beauty of this simple formula ! Proceeding in a similar way to the derivation in Sec . XI A , one obtains the relations for the calculation of the relative size S of the giant connected component . In the event of the site percolation problem , 1 (cid:0) S = H ( 1 ) = 1 (cid:0) p + p (cid:8) ( t (cid:3) ) ; ( 138 ) where t (cid:3) is the smallest real non - negative solution of the equation t (cid:3) = 1 (cid:0) p + p (cid:8) 1 ( t (cid:3) ) : ( 139 ) For the bond - percolation problem , one should apply Eq . ( 138 ) and t (cid:3) = (cid:8) 1 ( t (cid:3) ) instead of Eq . ( 139 ) . These relations were used in Ref . [ 62 ] to study the ef - fect of random damage on networks with di(cid:11)erent degree distributions . The results of the numerical calculations support the observations discussed in Sec . XI C , so that it is really hard to eliminate the giant connected compo - nent by this means . Basic relations ( 135 ) and the (cid:12)rst of ( 137 ) were de - rived in Ref . [ 60 ] in a di(cid:11)erent but instructive way . Let us outline it brie(cid:13)y . One starts the derivation applying the original criterion ( 116 ) of Molloy and Reed directly to the randomly damaged network . Then , it contains the degree distribution ~ P ( k ) of the damaged network . This degree distribution may be expressed in terms of the orig - inal distribution in the following way [ 60 ] : ~ P ( k ) = 1 X k 0 = k (cid:18) k 0 k (cid:19) p k ( 1 (cid:0) p ) k 0 (cid:0) k P ( k 0 ) : ( 140 ) Note that this equation is valid both for the deletion of vertices and deletion of edges . One may check that the (cid:12)rst and second moments of the degree distribution for the damaged network , ~ P ( k ) , are related to the moments of the degree distribution of the virgin network : k 0 = pk ; k 2 0 = p 2 k 2 + p ( 1 (cid:0) p ) k : ( 141 ) Substituting these relations into the criterion of Molloy and Reed ( 116 ) , one immediately gets Eqs . ( 135 ) and ( 137 ) . 51 1 00 1 S f g < 3 g > 3 FIG . 40 . Schematic plot of dependences of the relative size of the largest connected component in the randomly damaged (cid:12)nite size net vs . the fraction of removed vertices f = 1 (cid:0) p [ 60 ] . Distinct curves correspond to di(cid:11)erent network sizes N and two values of the (cid:13) exponent , 2 < (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 and (cid:13) > 3 . Arrows show displacement of the curves with increasing N . Dashed lines depict the limits N ! 1 . Notice the strong size e(cid:11)ects . In Ref . [ 60 ] , for networks with power - law distributions , the variation of the size of the giant connected compo - nent with p was studied through simulation ( see Fig . 40 ) . Strong size e(cid:11)ects was observed . For (cid:13) > 3 , the percola - tion threshold is visible at the point p c = 1 (cid:0) f c > 0 . For (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 , if a network is in(cid:12)nite , one sees that p c approaches zero , so that in this situation , one has to remove ( at ran - dom ) practically all vertices of the network to eliminate the giant connected component ! This very important observation can be understood if one looks at Eqs . ( 135 ) and ( 137 ) . Indeed , from Eq . ( 137 ) , it follows that the percolation threshold p c is zero if the second moment of the degree distribution of the virgin ( undamaged ) network diverges . This occurs in networks with power - law degree distributions when (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 , but this is only one particular possibility . For example , the second moment diverges in networks with copying ( inheritance ) of connections of vertices [ 187 { 189 ] ( see Sec . X ) , so that these network are also super - resilient to failures . The condition (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 for the resilience of scale - free net - works to random damage and failures makes the values of the exponents of the degree distributions of communi - cations networks quite natural . All of them are less than 3 ( see Sec . V C ) . Note that many other networks , e . g . , biological ones , must be necessarily resilient to failures . Therefore , this condition is of great importance . One should note that this result is valid for in(cid:12)nite net - works . As one can see from Fig . 40 , for (cid:13) < 3 , the size e(cid:11)ects are very strong , and the curves slowly approach the in(cid:12)nite network limit where p c ( N ! 1 ) = 0 . Here , N is the size of the network . Let us estimate this size e(cid:11)ect for 2 < (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 by introducing the size - dependent threshold p c ( N ) , whose meaning is clear from Fig . 40 . When N (cid:29) 1 , from Eq . ( 137 ) we obtain p c ( N ) = z 1 z 2 (cid:24) = k k 2 (cid:25) R N 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) k 0 dk kk (cid:0) (cid:13) R N 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) k 0 dk k 2 k (cid:0) (cid:13) : ( 142 ) Notice , that , for 2 < (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 , the average number of second - nearest neighbors is z 2 (cid:24) = k 2 , since the second moment diverges as N ! 1 , see Eq . ( 106 ) . The nature of the upper cut - o(cid:11) of the power - law degree distribution , k cut = k 0 (cid:24) N 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) , was explained in Sec . IX D . k 0 > 0 can be estimated as the minimal value of the degree in the network . One may expect that k 0 (cid:24) 1 . If 2 < (cid:13) < 3 , from Eq . ( 142 ) , it readily follows that p c ( N ) = C ( k 0 ; (cid:13) ) N (cid:0) ( 3 (cid:0) (cid:13) ) = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) : ( 143 ) Here , C ( k 0 ; (cid:13) ) does not depend on N and is of the or - der of 1 . C ( k 0 ; (cid:13) ) actually depends on the particular form of the degree distribution for small values of degree and is not of great interest here . When (cid:13) is close to 3 , p c = 0 can be approached only for a huge network . Even if (cid:13) = 2 : 5 and a net is very large , we get noticeable val - ues of the threshold p c , e . g . , p c ( N = 10 6 ) (cid:24) 10 (cid:0) 2 and p c ( N = 10 9 ) (cid:24) 10 (cid:0) 3 . This (cid:12)nite size e(cid:11)ect is most pronounced when (cid:13) = 3 . In this case , Eq . ( 142 ) gives p c ( N ) (cid:25) 2 k 0 ln N : ( 144 ) For example , if k 0 = 3 , p c ( N = 10 4 ) (cid:25) 0 : 07 , p c ( N = 10 6 ) (cid:25) 0 : 05 , and p c ( N = 10 9 ) (cid:25) 0 : 03 . These estimates demonstrate that in reality , that is , for (cid:12)nite scale - free networks , the percolation threshold is actually present even if 2 < (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 ( see Fig . 40 ) . Only if (cid:13) (cid:20) 2 , the threshold p c ( N ) is of the order of 1 = N ( that is , the value of the natural scale for p ) and is not observ - able . From the estimate ( 143 ) one sees , that if (cid:13) > 2 , it should be close enough to 2 for the extreme resilience of (cid:12)nite scale - free networks to failures . One may (cid:12)nd the discussion of the resilience of directed equilibrium networks to random damage in Ref . [ 112 ] . Strictly speaking , all the results of this section were obtained for equilibrium networks . We do not know any analytical answers for the problem of instant damage in growing networks . However , it seems that the results for equilibrium networks describe the observations [ 59 ] of instant damage in growing networks quite well . This is not the case for permanent damage in growing networks [ 203 , 204 ] ( see Sec . XI G ) . E . Intentional damage The intentional damage ( attack ) , as we have seen in Sec . XI C , can be de(cid:12)ned as the instant removal of a 52 fraction of vertices with the largest degrees . The theory outlined in Secs . XI A and XI D can be easily generalized to the situation when the occupation probability depends on the degree of a vertex of the undamaged network , so that p = p ( k ) [ 62 ] . Then , for the intentional damage , p ( k ) = 1 if k (cid:20) k cut and p ( k ) = 0 if k > k cut . k cut de - pends on the value of the fraction f of vertices which are deleted , so that k cut = k cut ( f ) . In Ref . [ 62 ] , this approach was used for the computa - tion of the dependence of the size of the giant connected component on f . The networks with power - law degree distributions without isolated vertices ( i . e . P ( 0 ) = 0 ) were considered . The calculations were performed for the power - law degree distributions with (cid:13) = 2 : 4 , 2 : 7 ; and 3 : 0 . It was shown that , in accordance with the observations in Ref . [ 59 ] , the deletion , in such a way , of a rather small fraction of vertices eliminates the giant connected compo - nent . The corresponding threshold values of f are really small , f c ( (cid:13) = 2 : 4 ) = 2 : 3 (cid:2) 10 (cid:0) 2 , f c ( 2 : 7 ) = 1 : 0 (cid:2) 10 (cid:0) 2 , and f c ( 3 : 0 ) = 0 : 2 (cid:2) 10 (cid:0) 2 . In this respect , the networks are very sensitive to these damage . On the other hand , the corresponding values of k cut , at which the transition takes place , were calculated to be k cut = 9 , 10 , and 14 for (cid:13) = 2 : 4 , 2 : 7 , and 3 : 0 , re - spectively . A simple estimate R 1 k cut ( f ) P ( k ) = f yields k cut ( f ) (cid:24) f (cid:0) 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) and provides the values k cut ( f c ( (cid:13) ) ) close to the above ones . This means that for elimination of the giant connected component in this situation , one has to delete even vertices of rather low degree . In this regard , one must produce a really tremendous destruc - tion to disintegrate such networks . Similar observations were made for the WWW [ 6 ] ( see Sec . V C 2 ) . It was found that even the deletion of all vertices of in - degree larger than 2 does not destroy the giant weakly connected component of the WWW . Let us show how the threshold f c depends on (cid:13) . In Ref . [ 63 ] the dependence f c ( (cid:13) ) was obtained in the framework of the continuum approach . Here we show how one can get the exact results [ 205 ] . From the relations of Ref . [ 62 ] obtained for the situa - tion when some vertices are deleted , and the occupation probability p ( k ) depends on vertex degree , it is easy to derive the following condition for the percolation thresh - old 1 X k = 0 k ( k (cid:0) 1 ) P ( k ) p ( k ) = 1 X k = 0 kP ( k ) ( 145 ) ( compare with Eq . ( 135 ) ) . Here , P ( k ) is the degree distribution of the undamaged network . The intentional damage cuts o(cid:11) vertices with k > k cut ( f ) , where k cut ( f ) can be obtained from f = 1 (cid:0) k cut X k = 0 P ( k ) : ( 146 ) Then , the condition ( 145 ) takes the following form : k 2 (cid:0) 2 k = 1 X k = 0 k ( k (cid:0) 2 ) P ( k ) = 1 X k = k cut ( f ) + 1 k ( k (cid:0) 1 ) P ( k ) : ( 147 ) Here , k 2 and k are the moments of the degree distribu - tion of the undamaged network . Equation ( 147 ) may be rewritten in the form [ 205 ] k cut ( f ) X k = 0 k ( k (cid:0) 1 ) P ( k ) = 1 X k = 0 kP ( k ) : ( 148 ) This is the generalization of the Molloy - Reed criterion to the case of intentional damage . Let us derive exact Eqs . ( 147 ) and ( 148 ) in another way using the instructive ideas of Ref . [ 63 ] but avoiding the continuum approximation . After the deletion of the most connected vertices , all the edges attached to the deleted vertices must also be removed . Connections in the network are random , so the probability ~ f that an edge is attached to one of the deleted vertices equals the ratio of the total number of edges of deleted vertices to the total degree of the network : ~ f ( f ) = 1 X k = k cut ( f ) + 1 P ( k ) = 1 (cid:0) k cut ( f ) X k = 0 P ( k ) : ( 149 ) Now we can recall that Eq . ( 137 ) for the percolation threshold is also valid for bond percolation . Therefore , it is possible to substitute ~ p c = 1 (cid:0) ~ f c into it . In fact , at (cid:12)rst , the vertices of the highest degree were removed ( the (cid:12)rst step ) , and only afterwards their connections were deleted ( the second step ) . In this event , Eq . ( 137 ) describes only the e(cid:11)ect of removal of edges . Then , it seems natural to use in Eq . ( 137 ) the degree distribution with the cut - o(cid:11) k cut ( f ) arising after the (cid:12)rst step . Accounting for this , one gets the relation ( 1 (cid:0) ~ f c ) k cut X k = 0 k 2 P ( k ) = ( 2 (cid:0) ~ f c ) k cut X k = 0 kP ( k ) ( 150 ) from which Eq . ( 147 ) follows immediately . This demon - strates the equivalence of the approaches of Refs . [ 62 ] and [ 60 , 63 ] . In the particular case of the power - law degree distri - bution , P ( 0 ) = 0 and P ( k (cid:21) 1 ) = k (cid:0) (cid:13) = (cid:16) ( (cid:13) ) , where (cid:16) ( (cid:13) ) (cid:17) P 1 k = 1 k (cid:0) (cid:13) is the zeta - function , Eq . ( 146 ) takes the form f = 1 (cid:0) P k cut k = 1 k (cid:0) (cid:13) (cid:16) ( (cid:13) ) ; ( 151 ) and condition for the percolation threshold ( 147 ) looks like k cut X k = 1 k 2 (cid:0) (cid:13) = (cid:16) ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) + k cut X k = 1 k 1 (cid:0) (cid:13) : ( 152 ) 53 From Eqs . ( 151 ) and ( 152 ) , one can easily obtain k cut ( (cid:13) ) and f c ( (cid:13) ) ( see Fig . 41 [ 205 ] ) . Note that f c > 0 only in the range 2 < (cid:13) < 3 : 479 : : : . When (cid:13) < 2 , a (cid:12)nite number of vertices keep a (cid:12)nite fraction of all con - nections , so their removal should have a striking e(cid:11)ect on the network . For (cid:13) > 3 : 479 : : : , the giant connected component is absent even before the attack . Indeed , in the undamaged network , the giant connected component exists if P 1 k = 1 ( k 2 (cid:0) 2 k ) k (cid:0) (cid:13) = (cid:16) ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:0) 2 (cid:16) ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) > 0 [ see Eq . ( 116 ) ] . This corresponds to (cid:13) < 3 : 479 : : : . 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 g 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 f c FIG . 41 . Dependence of the percolation threshold f c = 1 (cid:0) p c on the value of the (cid:13) exponent of the large scale - free network for intentional damage ( attack ) [ 205 ] . Such a dependence was originally obtained in the framework of a continuum approach [ 63 ] . Here we present the exact curve . f is the fraction of removed vertices with the largest numbers of connections . The degree distribution of the network before the attack is P ( k ) / k (cid:0) (cid:13) for k (cid:21) 1 , P ( 0 ) = 0 . The circle indicates the point (cid:13) = 3 : 479 : : : above which f c = 0 . The squares represent the results of calculations and simulation in Ref . [ 62 ] . The dependence f c ( (cid:13) ) has the maximum , f maxc = 0 : 030 : : : . This is a really small value , so the network is indeed weak against the attack . One should emphasize that this result is very sensitive to the particular form of P ( k ) in the range of small k and to the number of dead ends in the network . In particular , the range of the values of (cid:13) , where the giant connected component exists , crucially changes when the minimal degree increases . In Ref . [ 63 ] , one more interesting observation was made . The average shortest - path length between two vertices in random networks is of the order of the loga - rithm of their size ( see Sec . III B ) . The same statement is valid for vertices in their giant connected components . In Ref . [ 63 ] , the average shortest - path length between two vertices of the giant connected component was studied near the percolation threshold . In such a situation , like in ordinary in(cid:12)nite - dimensional percolation , the average shortest - path length was found to be proportional to the square root of the total number of vertices in the giant connected component . F . Disease spread within networks The dynamics of disease spread in undirected networks with exponential and power - law degree distributions was studied in Refs . [ 206 , 207 ] and then in Refs . [ 208 { 210 ] ( see popular discussion of these problems in Ref . [ 211 ] ) . This process is generically related to the percolation properties of the networks . For the modeling of the spread of diseases within networks , two standard models were used . In the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( SIS ) model , ( i ) each healthy ( susceptible ) vertex is infected with rate (cid:23) when it has at least one infected neighbor , and ( ii ) infected vertices are cured ( become susceptible ) with rate (cid:14) . Hence , the main parameter of the model is e(cid:11)ective spreading rate (cid:21) (cid:17) (cid:23) = (cid:14) . The susceptible - infected - removed ( SIR ) model with three states of vertices ( susceptible ( healthy ) , infected , and removed ( dead or immunized ) ) is slightly more com - plex . Nevertheless , the main parameter of interest de - scribing the spread of the disease is the same , that is , (cid:21) , and main results for the SIR model on networks [ 208 ] are similar to those for the SIS model [ 206 , 207 , 209 ] , so here we discuss the simpler case . Thus , we speak about the SIS model on equilibrium undirected networks . In non - scale - free networks ( expo - nential , Poissonian , the WS network , and others ) the sit - uation is very similar to the one for the disease spreading in ordinary homogeneous systems : there exists a nonzero epidemic threshold (cid:21) c (cid:24) k , where k is the average degree of a network , below which the disease dies out exponen - tially fast . This means that , after a random vertex be - comes infected , the average density of infected vertices ( prevalence ) (cid:26) ( t ) rapidly approaches zero . When (cid:21) > (cid:21) c , the infection spreads and becomes en - demic : (cid:26) ( t ! 1 ) (cid:17) (cid:26) / ( (cid:21) (cid:0) (cid:21) c ) . Notice that the dependence is linear in the vicinity of the threshold . For equilibrium undirected networks with arbitrary de - gree distribution P ( k ) , the epidemic threshold is at the point (cid:21) c = k k 2 : ( 153 ) The relation was obtained in the framework of the dy - namical mean - (cid:12)eld approach [ 206 , 207 ] . Note that , if the 54 ratio k = k 2 is small , the form of Eq . ( 153 ) naturally co - incides with Eq . ( 137 ) for the percolation threshold of randomly damaged network , and (cid:21) c (cid:24) = p c . Then the statements of Secs . XI C and XI D about the absence of the percolation threshold in in(cid:12)nite scale - free networks with (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 can be repeated for the epidemic threshold : in in(cid:12)nite networks , if (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 , diseases spread and become endemic for any (cid:21) > 0 . In general , in in(cid:12)nite networks , if k 2 diverges , the epidemic threshold is absent , so that this result is applicable for a wide class of networks , e . g . , see models of networks in Refs . [ 187 { 189 ] ( Sec . X ) . Thus , although the in(cid:12)nite scale - free networks with (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 are extremely robust against random damage , they are in - credibly sensitive to the spread of infections . Both these , at (cid:12)rst sight , contrasting phenomena have the same ori - gin , the fat tail of a degree distribution . One may notice that most of the observed scale - free networks in Nature ( see Sec . V , Fig . 24 , and Table I ) have (cid:13) exponent between 2 and 3 . Then , why are we still alive ? If the claim about the absence of the epidemic threshold in this networks is perfect , pandemics would never stop . We emphasize that the strong statement that the threshold is absent can be applied only for in(cid:12)nite net - works . In (cid:12)nite networks , the epidemic threshold is actually present . The estimates ( 143 ) and ( 144 ) also yield the dependence of the e(cid:11)ective epidemic threshold (cid:21) c ( N ) (cid:24) = p c ( N ) on the network size . As we demonstrated in Sec . XI D , (cid:21) c ( N ) in real networks with (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 may be large enough . Only if (cid:13) is close to 2 from above or smaller than 2 , the threshold is unobservable . Notice that many real networks have the (cid:13) exponents in this range . ( An - other quite plausible answer to our question is that the (cid:13) exponent value of the web of human sexual contacts may be greater than 3 , see Ref . [ 132 ] . ) In an in(cid:12)nite scale - free network with (cid:13) = 3 , the preva - lence in the endemic state is (cid:26) (cid:24) exp ( (cid:0) C = (cid:21) ) ; ( 154 ) ( see Refs . [ 206 , 207 ] ) where C is a constant . When (cid:13) > 3 but is close enough to (cid:13) = 3 , (cid:26) (cid:24) ( (cid:21) (cid:0) (cid:21) c ) 1 = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 3 ) : ( 155 ) Finally , according to continuum dynamic mean - (cid:12)eld cal - culations in Refs . [ 206 , 207 ] , when (cid:13) > 4 , (cid:26) (cid:24) ( (cid:21) (cid:0) (cid:21) c ) ( the degree distribution P ( k ) / k (cid:0) (cid:13) (cid:18) ( k (cid:0) m ) was used ) . Note , however , that if m = 1 , for large values of (cid:13) , the giant connected component is absent , the network is a set of disconnected clusters , and the disease spread is impossible . Here we again repeat that the results of this section was obtained for equilibrium random networks with statistically uncorrelated vertices . How can we stop pandemics in widespread scale - free networks with (cid:13) (cid:20) 3 ? In Refs . [ 208 , 210 ] , the e(cid:11)ects of im - munization for these networks were studied . The results obtained [ 208 , 210 ] may be easily understood if we recall the weak e(cid:11)ect of random damage to the integrity of such nets and strong e(cid:11)ect of an intentional attack ( see Secs . XI C , XI D , and XI E ) . Analogously , random immuniza - tion cannot restore the epidemic threshold , but targeted immunization programs for highly connected vertices are the most e(cid:11)ective way to stop an epidemic . G . Anomalous percolation on growing networks We have shown ( see Secs . XI A and Fig . 38 ) that per - colation on equilibrium networks displays many features of percolation on in(cid:12)nite - dimension lattices , i . e . of stan - dard mean - (cid:12)eld or e(cid:11)ective medium percolation . One might expect that such a \ mean - (cid:12)eld " behavior is nat - ural for all random networks which have no real metric structure . Furthermore , it seems , the abrupt removal of a large fraction of randomly chosen vertices or edges from the growing network presumably leads to rather stan - dard percolation phenomena , see Sec . XI C , although this issue is still not clear . However , as it was found in Ref . [ 203 ] , this is not the case for networks growing under permanent damage which show quite unusual percolation phenomenon . Here we discuss the process of the emergence of a gi - ant connected component in a growing network under the variation of growth conditions . In Ref . [ 203 ] , the simplest model of growing network , in which such a percolation phenomenon is present , was studied ( see Sec . IV ) : ( i ) At each time step , a new vertex is added to the network . ( ii ) Simultaneously , b new undirected edges are created between b pairs of randomly chosen vertices ( b may be non - integer ) . The degree distribution of this simple network is expo - nential . The matter of interest is the probability P ( s ; t ) that a randomly chosen vertex belongs to a connected component with s vertices at time t . The master equa - tion for this probability has the form [ 204 ] t @ P ( s ; t ) @ t + P ( s ; t ) = (cid:14) s ; 1 + bs s (cid:0) 1 X u = 1 P ( u ; t ) P ( s (cid:0) u ; t ) (cid:0) 2 bs P ( s ; t ) : ( 156 ) This is a basic master equation for the evolution of connected components in growing networks . Note that Eq . ( 156 ) is nonlinear unlike previously discussed master equations for degree distributions ( see Eq . ( 12 ) in Sec . VIII , Eq . ( 21 ) in Sec . IX A , ( 25 ) in Sec . IX B , ( 41 ) in Sec . IX C , ( 96 ) in Sec . X ) . The (cid:12)rst term on the right - hand side of Eq . ( 156 ) , i . e . , the Kronecker symbol , accounts for the addition of new vertices ( single clusters ) to the network , the second ( gain ) term is the contribution from the fusion of pairs of connected components into larger ones , the last ( loss ) term describes the disappearance of connected components due to the fusion processes . 55 Equation ( 156 ) has a stationary solution P ( s ) in the long time limit . From the distribution P ( s ) , the rela - tive size of the giant connected component also follows : W = 1 (cid:0) P 1 s = 1 P ( s ) . The following surprising results were found numerically and by simulation in Ref . [ 203 ] and then in the framework of exact analysis in Ref . [ 204 ] . It was shown that the phase transition of the emer - gence of giant connected component ( percolation tran - sition ) in the growing network cannot be described by an e(cid:11)ective medium theory . This phase transition is of in(cid:12)nite order , and , near the percolation threshold , the relative size of the giant component behaves as W ( b ) = 0 : 590 : : : exp (cid:26) (cid:0) (cid:25) 2 p 2 1 p b (cid:0) b c (cid:27) ; ( 157 ) where the constant 0 : 590 : : : may be calculated up to any desirable precision [ 204 ] . Here the rate b of the emer - gence of new edges plays the role of a control parameter . When b is small , the giant component is absent , and , ob - viously , when b is large , the giant component must be present . The phase transition occurs at b c = 1 = 8 . All the derivatives of W ( b ) are zero at this point in sharp contrast to a linear W ( b ) dependence in the standard mean (cid:12)eld theory of percolation . This indicates that this phase transition is of in(cid:12)nite order like the Berezinskii - Kosterlitz - Thouless phase transition [ 212 , 213 ] . When b < 1 = 8 , i . e . in the phase without the giant con - nected component , the average size of a (cid:12)nite connected component is s = 1 (cid:0) p 1 (cid:0) 8 b 4 b : ( 158 ) When the giant component is present , i . e . when b > 1 = 8 , s = 1 2 b ( 1 (cid:0) W ) : ( 159 ) This means that the average size of a (cid:12)nite connected component jumps discontinuously at the percolation threshold from 2 at b = 1 = 8 (cid:0) 0 ( the phase without the giant component ) to 4 at b = 1 = 8 + 0 ( the phase , in which the giant component is present ) [ 203 ] . This behavior is in contrast to the divergence of s at the threshold point for standard percolation . ( In the latter case , the diver - gence takes place , either one approaches the threshold from above or below . ) We emphasize that the anoma - lous percolation transition is not accompanied by any anomaly of the degree distribution . 0 . 075 0 . 1 0 . 125 0 . 15 b 1 2 3 4 5 s - 0 0 . 005 W FIG . 42 . Anomalous percolation in the growing network . ( a ) The giant connected component size W vs . the rate b of the creation of new edges in the growing network ( see Eq . ( 157 ) ) . ( b ) The average size s of a (cid:12)nite connected compo - nent vs . b ( see Eqs . ( 158 ) and ( 159 ) ) [ 203 ] . The region of anomalous percolation threshold b c = 1 = 8 is shown . The probability P ( s ) that a randomly chosen vertex belongs to a (cid:12)nite connected component of size s shows surprising behavior [ 204 ] . Recall that in standard perco - lation and in percolation in equilibrium networks P ( s ) is of a power - law form at the percolation threshold and it decreases exponentially both below and above the per - colation threshold . More precisely , near the standard percolation threshold , P ( s ) is a power law with an ex - ponential cuto(cid:11) . In the growing network the situation is quite di(cid:11)erent : ( i ) P ( s ) / [ s ln s ] (cid:0) 2 at the percolation threshold , ( ii ) is a power - law function with an exponential cuto(cid:11) at s c / 1 = W in the phase with the giant component and , ( iii ) in contrast to standard percolation , P ( s ) has a power - law tail in the entire phase without the giant com - ponent . Furthermore , in Ref . [ 204 ] this model was generalized , and the percolation in growing scale - free undirected net - works was studied ( preferential linking mechanism was applied ) . The results are similar to those described above . However , in this case , the percolation threshold b c and factors in Eq . ( 157 ) depend on the value of the exponent of the degree distribution . This anomalous behavior may be interpreted in the following way . New edges are being attached to large connected components with higher probability , and large connected components have a better chance to merge and grow . This produces the preferential growth of large con - nected components even in networks where new edges are 56 attached to randomly chosen vertices , that is , without any preference . Such a mechanism of e(cid:11)ective preferen - tial attachment of new vertices to large connected compo - nents naturally produces power - law distributions of the sizes of connected components and power - law probabili - ties P ( s ) . This \ self - organized critical state " is realized in the growing network only if the giant component is absent . As soon as the giant connected component emerges , the situation changes radically . A new channel of the evolution of connected components is coming into play , and , with high probability , large connected components do not grow up to even larger ones but join to the gi - ant component . Therefore , there are few large connected components if the giant component is present , and then P ( s ) is exponential . Thus , in the growing networks , two phases are in con - tact at the point of the emergence of the giant con - nected component | the critical phase without the giant component and the normal phase with the giant compo - nent . This contact provides the above described e(cid:11)ects . There exists another example of a contact of a \ critical phase " ( the line of critical points ) with a normal phase , namely , the Berezinskii - Kosterlitz - Thouless phase transi - tion [ 212 , 213 ] . Interestingly , critical dependences in both these cases have similar functional forms . We (cid:12)nish this section with the following remark . Other percolation problems for random networks can be con - sidered . For instance , in the recent paper [ 214 ] , \ core " percolation was introduced . Dead - end vertices and their nearest neighbors are removed successively up to the point when no dead ends remain . The remaining giant component ( if it exists ) is called \ core " . For the classical random graph ( Erd(cid:127)os - R(cid:19)enyi network ) , it was found that the core is present when the average degree k is above e = 2 : 718 : : : . For comparison , in the same network , the ordinary giant connected component exists if k > 1 [ 74 ] ( see Secs . VI and XI A ) . XII . GROWTH OF NETWORKS AND SELF - ORGANIZED CRITICALITY We have demonstrated above that the growing net - works often self - organize into scale - free structures . The change of parameters controlling their growth removes them from the class of scale - free structures . This is typ - ical for the general self - organized criticality phenomena [ 68 { 70 ] , so the considered processes can be linked with many other problems . In the present section , we discuss brie(cid:13)y this linking . A . Linking with sand - pile problems As long as only a degree distribution , that is , the dis - tribution of a one - vertex characteristic , is studied , the models of networks growing with preferential linking can be reduced to the following general problem [ 169 ] ( see Fig . 20 ) . At each increment of time , m new particles are distributed between the increasing number ( by one per time step ) of boxes according to some rule . Here , the boxes play the role of vertices . The particles are associ - ated with edges . The probability that a new particle gets to a particular box depends on the (cid:12)lling of this box and on the (cid:12)lling numbers of all other boxes . In fact , what we made in Secs . VIII , IX , and X , was mainly consideration of various versions of this classical model . One can enumerate the boxes by age , so that such a system has boundaries , the \ oldest " box and the new one , and , naturally , the distributions of particles in di(cid:11)erent boxes are di(cid:11)erent . In fact , the resulting enumerated set of boxes looks like a sand pile with a front ( boxes being added ) moving with unit rate . The height of the sand pile increases as the box age grows . Obvious relations to some other classical problems are also possible . For instance , the arising master equations can be generically related to those for fragmentation phe - nomena . One should also mention the Flory - Stockmayer theory of the polymer growth [ 215 { 217 ] . B . Preferential linking and the Simon model Reasons for power - law distributions occurring in vari - ous systems , including systems mentioned in Sec . XII A , were a matter of interest of numerous empirical and the - oretical studies starting from 1897 [ 218 { 220 ] . An impor - tant advance was achieved by H . A . Simon ( 1955 ) , who proposed a simple model producing scale - free distribu - tions [ 65 , 66 ] . The Simon model , can be formulated in the following way [ 172 ] . Individuals are divided to groups . ( i ) At each increment of time , a new individual is added to the system . ( ii ) a ) With probability p ( Simon used the notation (cid:11) ) , it establishes a new family ; b ) with the complementary probability 1 (cid:0) p , it chooses at random some old individ - ual and joins its family . The rule ( ii ) b ) simply means that new individuals are distributed among families with probability proportional to their sizes , similar to rules for preferential linking . The number of individuals , of course , equals t , and , at long times , the number of families is pt . Using the master equation approach ( see Sec . IX B ) , and passing to the long - time limit it is possible to get the following station - ary equation for the distribution of the sizes of families , P ( k ) + ( 1 (cid:0) p ) [ kP ( k ) (cid:0) ( k (cid:0) 1 ) P ( k (cid:0) 1 ) ] = (cid:14) k ; 1 : ( 160 ) Introducing (cid:13) = 1 + 1 = ( 1 (cid:0) p ) , we can write the solution of Eq . ( 160 ) in the form P ( k ) = ( (cid:13) (cid:0) 1 ) B ( k ; (cid:13) ) k (cid:29) 1 / k (cid:0) (cid:13) ; ( 161 ) 57 where B ( ) is the beta - function . Therefore , the power - law distribution with exponent (cid:13) naturally arises . Recently , the non - stationary distribution P ( k ; t ) was also described analytically [ 221 ] ( see also Ref . [ 222 ] ) . The Simon model was originally proposed without any relation to networks . However , it is possible to formulate the Simon model for networks in terms of vertices and , e . g . , directed edges [ 177 ] . ( i ) At each increment of time , a new edge is added to the network . ( ii ) a ) Also , with probability p a new vertex is added , and the target end of the new edge is attached to the vertex . b ) With the complementary probability 1 (cid:0) p , the target end of the new edge is attached to the target end of a randomly chosen old edge . Here , rule ( ii ) b ) corresponds to the distribution of new edges among vertices with probability proportional to their in - degree . One should indicate some di(cid:11)erence between the Simon model and the models of growing net - works with preferential linking . In the models of Secs . VIII , IX , and X , one vertex was added at each time step . In the Simon model , at each increment of time , one indi - vidual ( edge ) is added , and the number of added families ( vertices ) is not (cid:12)xed . Of course , this can not change the stationary distributions and the value of (cid:13) exponent . The behavior of P ( k ; t ) at long times ( large network sizes ) is also similar . In fact , both the original Simon model and the prefer - ential linking concept are based on a quite general prin - ciple { popularity is attractive . Popular objects ( idols ) attract more new fans than the unpopular ones . Nevertheless , one should note that the matter of inter - est of Simon was the one - particle distribution , whereas , for networks , this is only a small part of the great prob - lem : what is their topology ? C . Multiplicative stochastic models and the generalized Lotka - Volterra equation One may look at the models of the network growth un - der mechanism of preferential linking from another point of view . The variation ( increase ) of the degree of a vertex is proportional to the degree of this vertex . This allows us to relate such models to the wide class of multiplica - tive stochastic processes . Last time , these processes are intensively studied in econophysics and evolutionary bi - ology [ 223 { 229 ] . In particular , they are used for the de - scription of wealth distribution . The most widely known example is the generalized Lotka - Volterra equation [ 223 ] , w i ( t + 1 ) = r i ( t ) w i ( t ) + Atw ( t ) (cid:0) c ( w ( t ) ; t ) w i ( t ) : ( 162 ) Here , w i ( t ) may be interpreted as the wealth of agent i , i = 1 ; : : : ; N , w ( t ) = P Ni = 1 w i ( t ) = N is the average wealth at time t . The distribution of the random noise r i ( t ) is independent of t . Its average value is h r i ( t ) i = Bt and the standard deviation equals Dt . A is a positive constant , and c ( w ; t ) is proportional to t at long times . Such a dependence on t of the coe(cid:14)cients in Eq . ( 162 ) provides stationary distributions at long times . In the di(cid:11)erential form , Eq . ( 162 ) can be written as dw i ( t ) dt = [ r i ( t ) (cid:0) 1 ] w i ( t ) + Atw ( t ) (cid:0) c ( w ( t ) ; t ) w i ( t ) : ( 163 ) Interpretation of Eqs . ( 162 ) and ( 163 ) in terms of the wealth distribution is quite obvious . In particular , the last term restricts the growth of wealth . It was shown [ 229 , 230 ] that the average wealth w ( t ) approaches a (cid:12)xed value w at long times , and these equations produce the following stationary distribution P ( w i ) / exp (cid:18) (cid:0) A D w w i (cid:19) w (cid:0) (cid:13) i ; ( 164 ) where the exponent of the power - law dependence is (cid:13) = 2 + A = D . Eq . ( 164 ) gives P ( 0 ) = 0 . Note that the resulting distribution is independent of B and c ( w ; t ) . The main di(cid:11)erence of the particular stochastic multi - plicative process described by Eqs . ( 162 ) and ( 163 ) from the models considered in Secs . VIII , IX , X , and XII B is the (cid:12)xed number of the involved agents . Nevertheless , the outlined general approach can be used for networks ( e . g . , see Ref . [ 185 ] ) . On the other hand , the results ob - tained for the degree distributions of evolving networks ( see Secs . VIII , IX , and X ) may be interpreted , for ex - ample , in terms of the wealth distribution in evolving societies . XIII . CONCLUDING REMARKS The progress in this (cid:12)eld is incredibly rapid , and we have failed to discuss and even cite a number of recent re - sults . In particular , we have missed random , intentional , and adaptive walks on networks [ 98 , 231 { 234 ] which are closely related to problems of the organization of e(cid:11)ec - tive search in communication networks . We didn’t dis - cuss the distribution of the number of the shortest paths passing through a vertex , which has a power - law form in scale - free networks [ 235 , 236 ] , and many other inter - esting problems ( see , e . g . , Refs . [ 237 { 251 ] ) . After this review had been submitted , we learned about the review of Albert and Barab(cid:19)asi on the statistical mechanics of networks under preparation [ 252 ] . We call the reader’s attention to this paper . Most studies which we reviewed focused on structural properties of growing networks . Two aspects of the prob - lem can be pointed out . ( i ) Speci(cid:12)c mechanisms of the network growth produce their structure and , in particular , the degree distributions of their vertices . We demonstrated that the preferential linking mechanism ( preferential attachment of new edges 58 to vertices with a higher number of connections ) pro - vides degree distributions with long tails . Such nets are abundant in Nature . In particular , the communications networks have degree distributions just of this kind . The preferential linking is the reason of the self - organization of a number of growing networks into scale - free struc - tures . ( ii ) The resulting networks with such long - tailed dis - tributions have quite di(cid:11)erent properties than classical random graphs with the Poisson degree distribution . In particular , they may be extremely resilient to random damage . This substantial property partly explains their abundance in Nature . From the other hand , diseases may freely spread within these nets . The global topology of such networks is described by a theory that actually gen - eralizes the standard percolation theory . This theory is based on the assumption of statistical independence of vertices of an equilibrium network . In such an event , the joint in - and out - degree distribution P ( k i ; k o ) completely determines the structure of the network . This is one of the reasons why the knowledge of the degree distribution is so important . Despite the evident success of this ap - proach , one can see that its basic assumptions are not valid for non - equilibrium , growing networks . Keeping in mind most intriguing applications to the evolving communications networks , we have to admit that , currently , the most of the discussed models and ideas can be applied to the real networks only on a schematic , qualitative level . These simple models are still far from reality and only address particular phenomena in real networks . The title of the seminal paper of Erd(cid:127)os and R(cid:19)enyi ( 1960 ) was \ On the evolution of random graphs " [ 78 ] . What Erd(cid:127)os and R(cid:19)enyi called \ random graphs " were simple equilibrium graphs with the Poisson degree dis - tribution . What they called \ evolution " was actually the construction procedure for these graphs . Main recent achievements in theory of networks are related with tran - sition to study of the evolving , self - organizing networks with non - Poisson degree distributions . The fast progress in this (cid:12)eld , in particular , means a very signi(cid:12)cant step toward understanding the most exciting networks of our World , the Internet , the WWW , and basic biological net - works .
