This improved survival requires a different approach and specific expertise to meet the needs of this group . The aim of this study is to explore the health care experiences of AYAs with a UPCP . Methods We conducted a multicenter qualitative study using semi - structured interviews and elements of the grounded theory by Corbin and Strauss . Results Interviews were conducted with 46 AYAs with a UPCP . They were on average 33 . 4 years old ( age range 23 – 44 ) , and most of them were woman ( 63 % ) . Additionally , five AYAs with a UPCP participated as AYA research partners in two focus groups . They were on average 31 . 8 years old and four of them were woman . AYAs with a UPCP reported four pil - lars for a satisfied healthcare experience : ( 1 ) trust , ( 2 ) tailored communication , ( 3 ) holistic empathic open attitude , and ( 4 ) care being offered ( pro - ) actively . They reported both optimal and suboptimal experiences about distrust based on a delay in diagnostic trajectory , lack of tailored communication and discussion of sensitive topics , preference for a holistic approach , and struggles with finding the way to get additional healthcare support . Conclusion For AYAs with a UPCP , it is important that both age - specific issues and issues related to the UPCP are understood and addressed ; however , this seems not yet optimally implemented in clinical practice . This emphasizes the importance of providing this patient group with tailored care incorporating both aspects . Healthcare professionals need to be supported with training and tools to understand the healthcare needs of AYAs with a UPCP . AYAs can be empowered to take more control over their own healthcare needs Keywords Adolescents and young adults · Uncertain and / or poor cancer prognosis · Healthcare experiences · Qualitative research Introduction Advancements in treatment have led to increased survival rates for cancer survivors overall ; consequently , nowadays , a growing number of individuals diagnosed with advanced or metastatic cancer are also living longer with their can - cer [ 1 , 2 ] . People living with advanced or metastatic cancer may receive lifelong treatment to prolong life but without expectation of a cure for their cancer . Next to this group , patients with low - grade gliomas live with the uncertainty of a disease that eventually will evolve to a lethal brain tumour . Living longer with advanced or metastatic cancer often comes with a cost of burdensome physical symptoms ; psychosocial issues such as on - going uncertainty , anxiety and stress about running out of treatment options ; financial hardship ; social challenges and negative impact on one’s normal daily life and future perspectives [ 3 – 6 ] . In addition , these patients have complex care needs that include care coordination among multiple care providers [ 7 – 9 ] . A subpopulation within this large group of patients liv - ing with advanced or metastatic cancer is the so - called Olga Husson and Winette T . A . van der Graaf have joint contribution as last authors . Extended author information available on the last page of the article Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 721 1 3 721 Page 2 of 16 adolescents and young adults ( AYA ) living with an uncer - tain or poor cancer prognosis ( UPCP ) [ 10 ] . In the Neth - erlands , AYAs are defined as those diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 39 [ 11 ] . Previous studies indicate that AYAs with cancer have different psychosocial and medi - cal needs than their older adult cancer patients , related to their specific developmental life stage and age - related risk factors [ 12 – 18 ] . These unique age - specific needs may be even more complex in AYAs with a UPCP , as they are struggling with a loss of control , a sense of grief about their previous life and about the life that they are not going to live , loneliness and feeling inferior to previous self and others [ 19 ] . These challenges are associated with a sense of altered identity , their ( new ) position in the social net - work and the future uncertainties of an AYA with a UPCP [ 19 ] . Up to now , research on unmet care needs and expe - riences of AYAs in general showed a lack of clear age - appropriate information and communication by healthcare professionals ( HCPs ) about disease , treatment and impli - cations for daily life [ 8 , 13 , 20 ] . The way HCPs interacts with the AYA and deal with their care needs is an impor - tant contributor to patients’ satisfaction with care [ 13 ] . However , a recent study showed that HCPs experienced emotional and practical challenges when providing care to AYAs with a UPCP , especially regarding communication about the uncertain life perspective and support on psycho - social level [ 21 ] . AYA age - specific knowledge and under - standing the psychosocial needs of an AYA cancer patient related to their developmental life phase are important aspects for HCPs to increase trust and confidence of their AYA cancer patients [ 13 ] . Multiple studies found unmet needs of AYAs , such as age - appropriate information , life themes ( e . g . , school , work ) and peer support [ 22 – 27 ] . Worldwide , several AYA care programs and interven - tions are being developed to meet the unique needs of AYA patients [ 28 – 31 ] . For example , the AYA topic list as developed by the Dutch AYA Care Network , which serves as a tool for healthcare professionals for address - ing AYA - related topics [ 32 ] . However , to date , the care experiences and care needs of AYAS with a UPCP are largely unknown , and there are no specific care initiatives for this new patient group . As treatment advancements ask for changes in clinical guidelines and the need for expert knowledge , there is growing attention that patient - centred care initiatives have to be developed to meet the unique medical , psychosocial and supportive care needs of AYAs with a UPCP . Therefore , this study aimed to explore the care experiences of AYAs with a UPCP , with a focus on areas of improvements . The goal was to provide oncology HCPs with examples and tools to provide the best pos - sible care . Methods This paper presents a secondary analysis of the qualita - tive interview study ( conducted April 2021 – April 2022 ) of Burgers et al . [ 19 ] . The Consolidation Criteria for Report - ing Qualitative Studies guideline was followed to guaran - tee quality and transparency of reporting [ 33 ] ( Table 3 ) . Participants We recruited AYAs with a UPCP from eight University Medical Centers in the Netherlands , the Netherlands Cancer Institute and Haaglanden Medical Center . Eligible patients were those ( 1 ) diagnosed with any type of advanced cancer for the first time between 18 and 39 years of age , for which there is no reasonable hope of a cure , indicating that the patient will die prematurely due to cancer , and ( 2 ) able to speak and understand Dutch . Terminally ill patients with a life expectancy of less than 3 to 6 months and a poor perfor - mance status were excluded . Additionally , we included five eligible AYAs with a UPCP ( AD , NH , MH , SF , SF ) in a focus group as research partners , which is described in more detail in Burgers and colleagues [ 19 ] . This study obtained ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of The Netherlands Cancer Institute ( IRBd20 - 205 ) . Procedure A trained female psychologist and qualitative researcher ( VB ) conducted the one - on - one semi - structured interviews via Microsoft Teams after informed consent . The interview guide was based on current literature and drafted in col - laboration with experienced researchers ( WvdG , OH ) and AYA patients who were actively involved as research part - ners in this study ( AD , NH , MH , SF , SF ) ( Table 1 ) . For more details on the active involvement of AYA research partners in this study , see the GRIPP2 - SF checklist Table 4 [ 34 ] ( supplement 3 ) and study of Burgers et al . [ 35 ] . Besides the interviews , we conducted two online focus groups with five AYA research partners to discuss preliminary results of the interviews . The focus group aimed to check for inter - pretation and correctness of a patients’ point of view and gave additional insights into the healthcare experiences of AYAs with a UPCP [ 19 ] . Interviews and the focus groups were audio - recorded and lasted on average 84 min ( Range : 49 – 122 ) and 55 min ( range : 40 – 70 ) respectively . Further - more , patients completed a short case record form ( CRF ) on their sociodemographic and medical status . Addition - ally , clinical data was asked from the treating clinician after patients gave explicit permission . Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 721 1 3 Page 3 of 16 721 Data analysis Interviews and focus groups were transcribed verbatim , and the transcripts were analysed by VB with the help of NVivo [ 36 ] . Analysis was performed according to elements of the grounded theory by Corbin and Strauss , such as open , axial and selective coding in combination with a constructivist philosophical perspective [ 37 – 39 ] . A cyclic process was applied in which we were going back and forth between data collection and data analysis . For the first 15 interviews ( five for each subgroup ) , another independent researcher ( MR ) repeated this process , in order to identify and discuss differ - ent perspectives on the same data . In case of disagreement , the remaining codes were discussed with the research team and the AYA research partners . Axial coding was done with the help of “the paradigm” of Corbin and Strauss [ 37 ] . Data collection stopped when conceptual saturation was reached [ 37 ] . Results Demographics Forty - six of the 64 patients ( 71 % ) who were approached completed the interview . Eleven patients declined since they felt too unwell , four patients were too busy or did not want to talk about their disease and three patients did not respond . Five patients participated in the focus groups . The demo - graphics of the 46 patients and focus group are summarised in Table 2 . Healthcare experiences of AYAS with a UPCP AYAs with a UPCP reported optimal as well as suboptimal healthcare experiences , which can be summarized with the following four themes : ( 1 ) trust ; ( 2 ) tailored communication ; ( 3 ) holistic , open and empathic relation and ( 4 ) care being offered ( pro - ) actively . The “Results” section focuses on the healthcare wishes and needs of AYAs with a UPCP while the optimal healthcare experiences are mostly presented as examples of helpful behaviour in Table 5 . Theme 1 . Trust For AYAs with a UPCP , trust in the patient - doctor relation - ship is very important , since the majority experience distrust towards general practitioners and medical doctors based on their previous experiences such as a delay in diagnostic tra - jectory . They feel that they are not taken seriously due to their young age and that they receive incorrect or incomplete information . For some AYAs , it even caused serious trauma : “They never told me that there was a chance that it would metastasize and certainly not in that place of my body . You lose faith in what they say ? ” ( woman , 28 , rhabdomyosar - coma ) . This attitude of distrust is also projected onto their Table 1 Interview guide Questions Probes 1 .

Could you please tell me what kind of problems you are running into ? 2 . Do you or did you have unmet needs regarding information or sup - port ? If so , could you please elaborate ? ( it was not assessable , you didn’t find the right support or didn’t know where to find it ) Could you please give me an example of a situation in which you did not even notice you needed information or support until you received the information or support ? Who is your contact person within the hospital for specific questions ? Could you please elaborate ? 3 . How would you describe the relationship with your primary health - care professional ? ( possible to repeat this questions multiple times for different healthcare professionals ) Could you please give me an example that showcases this well ? What aspects are you satisfied about ? What would you like to see differ - ently ? What questions should your healthcare professional ask you or what should he / she notice about you to know how you are really doing ? 4 . With whom of the healthcare professionals do you feel free to discuss whatever you want ? Could you please elaborate ? ( what topics do you discuss , differences between healthcare professionals ) Are there any taboo topics you do not want to discuss with your health - care professional ( s ) ? Could you please elaborate ? 5 . What do you need from your healthcare professional when talking about end of life ? What are your needs regarding communication about end of life ? ( when and how ) Do they communicate clearly about which phase of the disease you are in currently ? Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 721 1 3 721 Page 4 of 16 treating doctor , even if this doctor had nothing to do with the delay in diagnostic trajectory . AYAs indicate they gain trust towards their medical doctor if they feel that he / she is skilled and has a lot of tumor - specific expertise . AYAs value a HCP who does not make them feel like a number in the healthcare system ; they want to be able to reach their medical doctor or another HCP , want a connection , tailored care and want to feel that their medical doctor is fighting for them . “Fighting” is described by AYAs as having the idea that their medi - cal doctor will do everything for them , like deviating from the protocol if necessary and looking for new ( experimen - tal ) treatments until the end . “To feel like : you are my only patient and I will do everything I can for you , because your life is important” ( woman , 41 , leiomyosarcoma ) . Trust in their medical doctor fluctuates over time and can easily be damaged by incidents ( e . g . not calling back , no clear infor - mation about prognosis ) . Almost all AYAs with a UPCP call their medical doctor their lifeline ; “That man [ medical Table 2 Demographic and clinical characteristics of the 46 AYA patients and the five focus group participants Characteristics Total AYAs a N ( % ) Focus group N ( % ) Age at initial diagnosis , years Range 23 – 39 20 – 38 Mean ( SD ) 29 . 6 ( 4 . 8 ) 27 . 6 ( 6 . 6 ) Current age , years Range 23 – 44 23 – 38 Mean ( SD ) 33 . 4 ( 6 . 3 ) 31 . 8 ( 5 . 5 ) Gender Woman 29 ( 63 . 0 ) 4 ( 80 . 0 ) Men 17 ( 37 . 0 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Religion No 38 ( 82 . 6 ) 5 ( 100 ) Yes b 8 ( 17 . 4 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Marital status Married or partnered 38 ( 82 . 6 ) 3 ( 60 . 0 ) Single 8 ( 17 . 4 ) 2 ( 40 . 0 ) Living situation Living alone 7 ( 15 . 2 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Living with partner and / or children 32 ( 69 . 6 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Living with children 3 ( 6 . 5 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Living with parents 2 ( 4 . 3 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Other c 2 ( 4 . 3 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Children Yes 19 ( 41 . 3 ) 2 ( 40 . 0 ) No 27 ( 58 . 7 ) 3 ( 60 . 0 ) Highest achieved level of education Secondary education or less 4 ( 8 . 7 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Secondary vocational education 16 ( 34 . 8 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Applied university 16 ( 34 . 8 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) University 10 ( 21 . 7 ) 2 ( 40 . 0 ) Employment status d Student 3 ( 6 . 5 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Paid work 20 ( 43 . 5 ) 2 ( 40 . 0 ) Unemployed 1 ( 2 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Homemaker 1 ( 2 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) On sick - leave / work disabled 23 ( 50 . 0 ) 2 ( 40 . 0 ) Type of cancer ( Low - grade ) glioma 16 ( 34 . 7 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Sarcoma 7 ( 15 . 2 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Breast cancer 6 ( 13 . 0 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Lung cancer 6 ( 13 . 0 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Melanoma 3 ( 6 . 5 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Cervical cancer 2 ( 4 . 3 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Other e 6 ( 13 . 0 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Stage at diagnosis ( interview ) III 1 ( 3 . 3 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) IV 25 ( 83 . 3 ) 3 ( 40 . 0 ) N / A or unknown f 20 ( 43 . 5 ) 2 ( 60 . 0 ) Current treatment g LGG low - grade glioma , N / A not applicable a Total N = total interviewed AYAs , AYAs participated in focus groups are not included b Yes = Christian , Protestant , Islamic c Other = living with brothers , living with parents and son , living with housemates d Total exceed 100 % since some participants were partly disabled and worked part - time for the other part e Other = colon cancer , epithelioid hemangioendothelioma ( EHE ) neuro - endocrine tumour ( NET ) , ovarian cancer , gastrointestinal stro - mal tumor ( GIST ) f N / A includes 16 low - grade gliomas patients , since these are grade 2 tumours according to WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System g Not equal to 100 % due to the combination of treatments h Psychologist , social worker , physiotherapist , dietician , occupational therapist , oedema therapist , spiritual care provider Table 2 ( continued ) Characteristics Total AYAs a N ( % ) Focus group N ( % ) None / Active surveillance 16 ( 34 . 8 ) 2 ( 40 . 0 ) Chemotherapy 14 ( 30 . 4 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Targeted therapy 10 ( 21 . 7 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Experimental therapy 3 ( 6 . 5 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Hormonal therapy 3 ( 6 . 5 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Immunotherapy 1 ( 2 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Radiotherapy 1 ( 2 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Receiving care from Medical doctor 47 ( 100 ) 5 ( 100 ) Clinical nurse specialist 12 ( 26 . 1 ) 2 ( 40 . 0 ) AYA clinical nurse specialist 4 ( 8 . 7 ) 1 ( 20 . 0 ) Other healthcare professionals h 20 ( 43 . 5 ) 3 ( 60 . 0 ) Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 721 1 3 Page 5 of 16 721 doctor ] decides about my life . He has to make sure that I live longer , I am dependent on him . ” ( woman , 44 , lung cancer ) . According to AYA cancer patients , their dependent position towards their medical doctor results in inequality in their relationship . AYAs want to be a ‘good patient’ to ensure their medical doctor remains 100 % committed , which means that they do not always openly share complaints . Theme 2 . Tailored communication In the context of an uncertain and / or poor cancer prognosis , the majority of the AYAs are unaware of their prognosis or current disease phase . Besides personal preference not to know , one of the causes is unclear communication by their medical doctor giving ambiguous answers or subjec - tive statements . “My medical doctor has never told me that I am palliative . I would not live to be 80 , but what does that mean ? ” ( woman , 33 , osteosarcoma ) . “My medical doctor is not afraid that I will die soon . What does that mean ? A half - year life expectancy ? She is more optimistic than me ; she thinks my scan looks fine when I see cancer almost everywhere” ( woman , 35 , breast cancer ) Some AYAs indicate that the information they receive is based on statistics that do not apply to them because of their young age . The content of the medical information is not always matching with the knowledge and understanding of medical jargon of the AYA . Additionally , the way of pro - viding medical information is not always aligned with their information processing speed . Others do experience continu - ous alignment and find it valuable : “He [ medical doctor ] asks what you want to know , tells you exactly what is going on and expects you to let him know if you understand . If not ( understands ) , he tries to explain it again” ( man , 36 , low - grade glioma ) . AYAs with a UPCP appreciate transparent and honest communication about prognosis , even if there is no clear answer , or if it is bad news . Some AYAs would rather prefer a broad life expectancy range than having no answer at all ; others find it helpful to get information on positive outliers . Some AYAs miss the acknowledgement of the emotional impact of the given information and wish to receive some time to process . This is also the case with end - of - life communication , where the right timing is of para - mount importance . According to most of the AYAs , the best time is when there is progression , and there are ( almost ) no treatment options left . However , almost everyone expresses that the expectation is that the medical doctor will initiate this end - of - life conversation . When this conversation is not initiated , the AYA believes it is probably not necessary . As an exception , some AYAs try to initiate the end - of - life con - versation but experience that their medical doctor dismisses this topic . Finally , some young AYAs indicate that they feel not always seen and treated as an adult when communicating with their medical doctor . One AYA explains that her con - sultations with the medical doctor feel like parental meet - ings , where she had to learn what to do and what not to do . Another AYA explains : “My neurologist called my father because I was not able to answer the phone . That was frus - trating . This is about me , I am an adult woman of 23 and my father is not in charge” ( woman , 23 , low - grade glioma ) . On the other hand , one AYA indicates that her young age was not taken into account when she requests to have someone with her during chemotherapy despite the COVID - 19 rules . Theme 3 . Holistic , empathic and open approach Most AYAs describe the relationship with their medical doctor as a professional relationship . Some AYAs report struggling with feeling rushed and the limited time during consultations , which often means that they do not feel the opportunity to ask all questions . Additionally , some AYAs hesitate to ask questions regarding drugs , sexual health and their wish to become a parent because they find it uncom - fortable . Others report being afraid of a negative response , a negative impact on their patient - doctor relationship or nega - tive consequences for their treatment when discussing topics like sex without a condom , suicidal thoughts , complementary care and a second opinion . “I have not even told my doctor what kind of supplements I started taking again because at the beginning she was so negative about everything I sug - gested” ( woman , 28 , rhabdomyosarcoma ) . According to AYAs with a nurse specialist or case - manger , this relation is more open , and the threshold to ask questions or initiate topics is less or even not present . However , the majority of the AYAs do feel as if they can discuss everything with their medical doctor since their medical doctor is open - minded and initiate discussions about sensitive topics . The good rela - tionship of AYAs with their medical doctor is defined by the degree of empathy and involvement of their medical doctor . The majority of the AYAs appreciate a doctor who shares some personal information and uses humour during their con - sultations . Most of all , AYAs with a UPCP find it important that their medical doctor has a holistic approach to treating them as individuals with emphasis on their quality of life . “A doctor who looks beyond his specialty and checks how things are on mental and physical level . Asking specific questions instead of ‘how are you’ because I often say I am fine so that does not work” ( woman , 41 , breast cancer ) . However , in clinical practice critical questions about one’s mental health , living situation or family are still not always asked . Some AYAs with a low - grade glioma complain about the lack of attention for brain tumour – related problems like epilepsy . Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 721 1 3 721 Page 6 of 16 Theme 4 . Care being offered ( pro‑ ) actively According to AYAs , patients have to be assertive if they want additional care in terms of mental or practical support . However , most of them do not know what kind of support they need since they do not know what support is available , and most importantly , they do not know where to get sup - port . AYAs report unmet needs regarding guidance after a bad news conversation , around the start of treatment and during treatment . They prefer someone who can relate to their experience like some experience expert buddy . “The books you get do not describe the emotional impact . It would be nice if you could talk to someone who has been through the same experience , a kind of buddy” ( woman , 36 , mela - noma ) . Additionally , several AYAs miss support regarding : work , finance , diet , exercise , support for their children and informal caregivers , complementary care , sexual health and fertility , peer support and epilepsy ( patients with low - grade glioma ) . Some AYAs report the lack of a nurse specialist or case - manger in specific : “For me , a nurse specialist would be a solution , someone who I can email for questions . But I do not have a nurse specialist and I am not going to call the doctor” ( woman , 35 , breast cancer ) . Several AYAs are in need of an information booklet with all the important aspects they should pay attention to as AYA with an incurable dis - ease , including a list of care initiatives and benefits to which they are entitled to , and existing patient organizations . AYAs without a regular contact person within the hospital often postpone their questions and are in need of a case manager or clinical nurse specialist . While most AYAs with a clinical nurse specialist or case manager reported optimal experi - ences and see them as gatekeepers for questions and addi - tional care . Some AYAs even believe they are responsible for keeping each HCP of the team up to date . Remarkably , some AYAs had not yet been referred to AYA care and some did not even know they belong to the AYA community . Discussion To our knowledge , this study is among the first that shows the healthcare experiences of AYAs with a UPCP . Overall , this group reported optimal as well as suboptimal experi - ences about the care they receive , reflecting the challenges of AYAs , HCPs as well as healthcare organizations . In this study , we identified four themes that can be seen as pillars for a satisfied healthcare experience according to AYAs with a UPCP : ( 1 ) trust , ( 2 ) tailored communication , ( 3 ) holis - tic empathic open attitude and ( 4 ) care being offered ( pro - ) actively . The four themes that were identified in this study show that most of the AYA healthcare experiences are not AYA - specific but are comparable with the healthcare experiences of adult cancer patients [ 40 – 42 ] . For example , trust is gener - ally considered an important component of the patient - doc - tor relationship ( 40 ) . Furthermore , previous research showed that adult advanced cancer patients also reported suboptimal experiences when communication was not tailored to their preferences and how important tailored communication is when it comes to prognostic information [ 41 , 42 ] . Besides their need to know and understand , adult cancer patients also have a need to feel understood [ 41 ] . This can be seen as their need for a holistic view and empathy . However , when zooming in on the four themes , we can conclude that some experiences specifically have to do with combination of a UPCP at AYA age . For example , we found that many AYAs with a UPCP experienced frustration about a delay in the diagnostic trajectory due to their age and tumour characteristics [ 43 ] . In most cases , they experienced this frustration before even starting treatment . AYAs with a UPCP feel like they always have to fight for their healthcare because they are often the exception and therefore do not fit within protocols . This makes trust an indispensable foun - dation for the patient - doctor relationship within this group of AYAs who call their doctor their “lifeline” . It has been suggested that a life - threatening disease and the severity of treatment might force patients to trust almost uncondition - ally [ 40 , 44 ] . However , this trust and distrust is often not discussed in the consultation room but is reflected in the behaviour of the patient such as searching for available treat - ments worldwide and assuming a dependent role towards the medical doctor [ 45 ] . The concept of distrust is lacking in AYA literature , indicating that it might be specific to the understudied group of AYAs with a UPCP . The amount of distrust in this patient group could be explained by the fact that the medical doctor cannot or is hesitative to give the AYA with a UPCP any certainty . Above , half of the AYA participants in this study were diagnosed with a rare disease ( low - grade glioma and sarcoma ) with diagnostic difficulties or diseases with less specific symptom features ( melanoma ) , which may play a role in the delay in the diagnostic tra - jectory [ 43 ] . The key elements for trust as reported by the Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 721 1 3 Page 7 of 16 721 AYAs in this study , such as a medical doctor with a lot of knowledge and skills , are in line with previous research [ 13 ] . Communication about disease status , prognosis and end - of - life care with AYAs with a UPCP is complex for HCPs . Medical doctors are often not able to give a prognosis for AYAs with a UPCP given the low clinical trial participation rates of AYAs , resulting in a lack of reliable data . AYAs experience a lack of clear communication and explanation regarding this uncertain prognosis [ 46 , 47 ] . Some of them do not even know their disease phase while they want to know , which hinders them from making important treatment deci - sions and plans for the future . Planning their future is even more important for this young age group since they are in a phase of life where generally important milestones are being achieved . Besides ambiguous information , it is well known that patients’ interpretations of their prognosis or disease phase can differ from those of their medical doctors , and some do not want to hear a poor prognosis [ 48 ] . Overall , it seems that doctors and patients are still holding each other in a coalition of hope : the doctor does not want to take away patients’ hope when initiating the conversation on end - of - life , and the patient believes all is well as long as this topic is not discussed [ 21 ] . Although this is a general phenomenon , previous research suggests that it might be more intense in the AYA population since their young age and lack of sta - tistical information are an extra challenge for oncologists when communicating about poor prognosis [ 21 ] . As a result , important goals regarding quality of life of the AYA may be missed . Looking at quality of life and the individual behind the disease are essential for trust in the medical doctor and ensure that the AYA does not feel like a number . However , the results of this study suggest that medical doctors do not often ask questions about everyday life and do not always initiate sensitive topics . Nevertheless , AYAs do not dare to ask those questions either . For example questions about complementary care , sex health and suicidal thoughts [ 49 ] . These topics are addressed as taboo topics in AYA patients by Perez et al . and are also mentioned in earlier research regarding challenging topics to discuss according to HCPs providing care to AYAs with a UPCP [ 14 , 21 ] . A future study comparing AYAs and older patients should indicate if these topics are indeed AYA specific . Furthermore , AYAs with a UPCP wish for a holistic , empathic and open attitude from their medical doctor . This corresponds with literature about generation x and y , in which this generation is described as empathic and innovative [ 50 , 51 ] . This can be translated to AYAs’ desire for an empathic response on their emotional behaviour and search for more emphasis on health behaviours such as diet , exercise and supplements . A previous study addressed searching for treatment alternatives as a coping strategy to deal with an uncertain prognosis [ 45 ] . The request for a holistic approach is also about seeing and understanding the age and developmental life phase in this context of a UPCP . It might be that in this specific AYA group , the UPCP some - times takes a more central spot than the AYA age [ 51 , 52 ] . It seems that the combination of a developmental life phase , the expectations and wishes of this age generation , namely generation Y ( born between 1982 - 1994 ) and Z ( born between 1995 and 2009 ) , according to a patient - doctor relationship and the UPCP making a holistic , empathic and open attitude extra important in AYAs with a UPCP [ 50 ] . Finally , AYAs with a UPCP do not always know which support is available and where to get it . Possibly , because most of them are not familiar with the healthcare system and some even do not know what their own needs are . Although this is the first study to investigate healthcare experiences of AYAs with a UPCP and it pioneers in involv - ing AYA research partners , some limitations need to be taken into account . First , the results of this study should be interpreted with some nuance since we interviewed patients only and did not include experiences from the HCP’s per - spective . We do know that patients do not process all the information , can be biased and can interpret information differently [ 48 ] . Furthermore , this study had a language barrier , and the sample was not ethnically diverse , which limits the generalizability of the results . It is certainly impor - tant that future research facilitates access to the study for AYAs with a migration background . Our results cannot be generalized to other countries since healthcare systems are different and might play a role in the experiences of AYAs with a UPCP . Additionally , this study did not succeed to include AYAs with a UPCP between 18 and 22 years of age [ 53 ] . It could be possible that these younger AYA patients do have different experiences and needs within the healthcare system because of their developmental life phase and more parental involvement . Because of the qualitative design of this study , we were not able to identify significant inter - personal differences between AYA patients and possible differences between medical specialists including medical oncologists , pulmonary physicians , neurologists and clinical nurse specialists [ 21 ] . Therefore , we cannot offer specific Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 721 1 3 721 Page 8 of 16 recommendations for subgroups within the population of AYAs with a UPCP or specific healthcare disciplines . Future quantitative research can provide such recommenda - tions , and adding a control group can provide comparisons between curative AYAs and older patients with UPCP . Since clinical nurse specialists play an important role within AYA care , future research should focus on the experiences in rela - tion to clinical nurse specialist specifically . Clinical implications In Table 5 , we summarized action points for HCPs related to the four themes of satisfied care with among others the optimal experiences as examples for clinical practice to fur - ther improve AYAs’ healthcare experiences . It is important to keep in mind that the right timing is essential in all of these examples . In the group of AYAs with a UPCP , it is essential to discuss their medical history in relation to trust in medical doctors and the medical system and find out what the key factors are to gain trust . Trust is essential for open and engaging communication [ 54 ] . Since the results suggest that AYAs with a UPCP hesitate to initiate sensitive top - ics , exploration ( exploring what AYAs know , want to know and understand what they are aiming for ) could be helpful for addressing patients’ varying information preferences but also to make communication more helpful in general [ 41 ] . Adding specific issues for AYA with a UPCP to the current AYA topic list as developed by the Dutch AYA Care can serve as a tool for healthcare professionals for addressing the important AYA and UPCP - related topics [ 19 , 32 ] . A question prompt list specifically for AYAs with a UPCP can possibly empower them to address sensitive topics during a medical consultation [ 55 , 56 ] . Additionally , less than half of the AYA patients in this study do have a clinical nurse specialist , while this is often recommended in AYA care programs , and according to the AYAs with a UPCP , it seems beneficial in terms of being a gatekeeper and a lower thresh - old to ask questions . Moreover , the results of this study can be integrated into a new education module that is currently under development , focusing on HCPs providing care to AYAs with a UPCP to help them to provide information and support [ 19 , 21 , 32 ] . Another important implication is the context of uncer - tainty and lack of a clear prognosis . However , an uncertain prognosis still requires clear communication and explana - tion . There are several suggestions from previous literature to discuss prognosis and end of life in an emotional support - ive approach ( Table 5 ) [ 14 , 41 , 51 , 52 , 57 ] . For example , the ‘ask - provide information - respond to emotion - ask’ cycle to assess needs or understanding , deliver information compas - sionately , manage information and explore patients’ goals , hopes , worries and values [ 14 ] . Additionally , Mori and colleagues studied phrases to communicate prognosis and found that phrases with the median , typical range , best / worst cases and “hope for the best and prepare for the worst” cases were preferred by cancer patients [ 57 ] . Since general and tumour - specific information is often spread across websites and patient organizations , it would be beneficial to bundle general information for AYAs with a UPCP [ 58 ] . At last , we can learn from existing buddy systems , in which AYAs can reach out for emotional and informational support [ 59 , 60 ] . In conclusion , age - specific issues and wishes should be addressed while at the same time , the focus is on the UPCP . Moreover , these patients are part of a new generation , which requires different communication , healthcare expectations and needs . Given the challenging combination of a young age and an uncertain prognosis , it is recommended to sup - port HCPs treating this unique patient group and empower AYAs with a UPCP within the healthcare system in order to make sure they receive the best patient - centred care possible .

One AYA was already involved in the phase of grant applica - tion and recruited another AYA , two other AYAs were invited to con - tribute as research partner after they participated in the AYA interview study , and one AYA was recruited via the researcher . According to each preferences and availability , AYA research partners attending several online meetings to contribute to this study . p . 3 3 : Study results outcomes—report the results of PPI in the study , including both positive and negative outcomes AYA research partners contributed to the study in several ways , including : - Being a participant in the pilot testing phase - Reviewing and adapting the patient information letter for relevance , word use and level of confrontation - Reviewing and adapting the interview guide for relevance , comprehen - siveness , word use and level of confrontation - Discussing about how to provide the best aftercare for participants - Contributing in consensus meetings about the results and checking for correct interpretation - Checking the general framework for misinterpretation or gaps in logic - Editing and being co - author of the paper p . 3 4 : Discussion and conclusions Outcomes—comment on the extent to which PPI influenced the study overall . Describe positive and negative effects Collaboration with AYA research partners provides more appropriate and relevant research regarding AYAs with a UPCP and contributed to a bet - ter translation to suggestions for clinical practice . Adjustment and prior - itisation of interview questions , information about appropriate questions and knowledge about the wish for after care , resulted in an improved methodology and more confidence in the researcher . During the discus - sion of the results , themes were renamed . The experience of the AYA research partners also provides more insight and context to interpret the results of the study . The AYA themselves were proud to contribute , appreciated the feeling of being seen of added value and received sup - port from the contact moments with other AYA research partners . N / A 5 : Reflections / critical perspective Comment critically on the study , reflecting on the things that went well and those that did not , so others can learn from this experience Patient involvement is an investment of time and effort , since you have an extra group of people who have to make decisions about your study . These research partners are included because of their experiential knowledge and not because of their scientific skills , which can result in the need for extra coaching and information . This also requires some extra skills of the researcher . The main challenge but also the most important aspect is regularly evaluating and staying in contact with the AYA research partners . Even when they are not that involved at that moment ( e . g . writing manuscript ) . As conclusion , seeing the impact of performing research with AYA instead of about AYA is worth the invest - ment . Timely preparation and good communication can make it less time consuming .
