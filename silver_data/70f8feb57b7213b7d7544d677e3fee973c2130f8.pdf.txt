Although many steps in actin fi lament reorganization are pre - cisely regulated , one step that must be carefully controlled is the nucleation of new fi laments . Several proteins and protein com - plexes have been identifi ed that nucleate new actin fi laments such as various formins , Spire , Cordon Bleu , and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Pollard , 2007 ; Winckler and Schafer , 2007 ) . All of these mechanisms achieve actin fi lament nucleation , but the Arp2 / 3 complex is unique in that it anchors these new daughter fi laments to the side of a preexisting mother fi lament at a char - acteristic (cid:2) 70 ° angle . This generation of actin branches by the Arp2 / 3 complex forms the basis for the dendritic nucleation model of actin assembly ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . This type of actin assembly has been observed at the leading edge of many motile cell types as well as at sites of endocytosis and in the rocketing comet tails of patho - genic organisms such as Listeria monocytogenes ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ) . The universality of Arp2 / 3 - based actin assembly has recently been called into question by a study that fi nds that actin - based processes continue to occur in the absence of Arp2 / 3 function ( Gupton et al . , 2005 ) . This likely refl ects the complexity and partial redundancy of actin assembly mechanisms in robust biological systems . However , the importance of Arp2 / 3 function is underscored by the recent discovery that deletion of genes The actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) story has capti - vated the cytoskeleton community for over a decade . Not only does this complex nucleate new actin ﬁ laments , but it also anchors them into a dendritic meshwork that is used in many cellular contexts such as lamellipodial protrusion , endosome rocketing , and the movement of pathogens . One key piece of this puzzle that has been missing is a de - tailed structure of the Arp2 / 3 - actin branch . Using electron tomography and computational docking , Rouiller et al . ( Rouiller , I . , X . - P . Xu , K . J . Amann , C . Egile , S . Nickell , D . Nicastro , R . Li , T . D . Pollard , N . Volkmann , and D . Hanein . 2008 . J . Cell Biol . 180 : 8 8 7 – 8 9 5 ) present an elegant and intriguing structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated actin branch . Correspondence to James E . Bear : jbear @ email . unc . edu encoding two of the complex subunits leads to preimplantation lethality in mice ( Yae et al . , 2006 ; Vauti et al . , 2007 ) . The structure of the soluble , inactive Arp2 / 3 complex was solved in 2001 ( Robinson et al . , 2001 ) . This landmark study has provided many insights into the structural arrangements of the subunits of the complex and has provoked a great deal of interest in how the complex is activated and how it forms a branch . Using this structure , 2D docking experiments were performed on branches visualized by negative staining ( Volkmann et al . , 2001 ) . A later version of these docking experiments was guided by using the Arp2 / 3 complex where various subunits were tagged with GFP , allowing the tagged subunit to be oriented by the extra electron density of the fl uorescent protein ( Egile et al . , 2005 ) . Although these studies were very informative , they did not give a precise picture of how the complex was oriented within the branch and did not provide information on how the mother fi lament might be modifi ed at the branch . Rouiller et al . ( see p . 8 8 7 of this issue ) provide a major step forward in this fi eld by reporting the 3D structure of an Arp2 / 3 - actin branch . The authors used both negative staining and cryo - EM ( frozen - hydrated samples ) along with tomo - graphic reconstruction to visualize the structure of actin fi la - ment branches generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Impressively , they used Arp2 / 3 complex from Acanthamoeba castellanii , yeast , and cow and observed virtually identical results . After tomog raphy , they used computational docking methods to fi t the known crystal structures of the Arp2 / 3 complex into the reconstructions . The resolutions of these reconstructions is (cid:2) 2 . 6 nm , so individual protein subunits can be located easily and large changes in confor mation within these subunits can be detected , but subtle changes in conformation cannot be resolved . One major fi nding in this study is that arrangement of the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits within the complex in a branch is quite different than in the inactive soluble complex ( Fig . 1 ) . In the branch , these two subunits come together and form a short - pitch helix dimer and together contribute the fi rst two subunits of the daughter actin fi lament . This observation confi rms the long - held suspicions about these subunits and excludes other models that had an Arp subunit incorporated into the mother actin fi lament . Bringing together the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits requires a sub - stantial rearrangement of the entire complex , and Rouiller et al . ( 2008 ) postulate that the free energy contributed by the binding of several factors ( F - actin , G - actin , and activating protein ) is re - quired to drive this conformational change and overcomes the kinetic barrier to branching . Peering deeply inside the branch Liang Cai 1 , 2 and James E .

Another particularly intriguing fi nding from this study is the signifi cant alteration of the actin subunits in the mother fi la - ment that contact the Arp2 / 3 complex in the branch . Surprisingly , all seven subunits make some contact with the mother fi lament , and the total area of surface that is buried at this contact site is substantial ( 9 , 100 Å 2 ) . On the mother fi lament side , fi ve actin sub - units make contact with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Two of these subunits showed a distortion from the typical F - actin conformation in the reconstructions . In one case , the conformation was similar to the closed conformation seen in actin monomers . However , the other distorted mother fi lament subunit showed an open nucleotide - binding cleft reminiscent of apo ( nucleotide free ) Arp3 . One inter - esting area to explore in future studies is whether these changes require activation of the complex and / or the presence of a daughter fi lament to occur . This information may explain the puzzling results from several studies indicating that the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex has a relatively low affi nity ( (cid:2) 2 – 4 μ M ) for the sides of actin fi laments ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Gournier et al . , 2001 ; Beltzner and Pollard , 2007 ) . The structure of the Arp2 / 3 - actin branch will open many possible lines of future research . The work of Rouiller et al . ( 2008 ) provides critical information that will allow the com - plete elucidation of the pathway that leads to branch formation . It is known that the Arp2 / 3 complex , an actin fi lament , a nucleation - promoting protein such as SCAR or WASP , and an actin monomer must converge to form a branch , but the specifi c temporal se - quence and the interrelationship between these binding events are incompletely understood . This question has important im - plications for how and where Arp2 / 3 branches form in cells . Another area that this structure could potentially illuminate is the role of nucleotide hydrolysis by the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits in branch structure and debranching . Nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by both subunits are important for Arp2 / 3 complex activity in yeast ( Martin et al . , 2006 ) , and the structure of the inactive complex is affected by bound nucleotide ( Nolen and Pollard , 2007 ) . However , the role of nucleotide binding / hydrolysis in branch structure or dynamics is much less clear . Finally , this Figure 1 .

The yellow circle shows a comparison of the inactive , soluble Arp2 / 3 complex ( green ) and the complex in the branch ( red ) . 855 PEERING DEEPLY INSIDE THE BRANCH • CAI AND BEAR Rouiller , I . , X . - P .
