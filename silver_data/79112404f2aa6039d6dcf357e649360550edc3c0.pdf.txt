Animal models , on the other hand , also have difﬁculties predicting human responses , and are ethically concerning . In this study , we employed a hybrid approach where we combined mathematical modeling with 3D in vitro models that mimic aspects of the tumor microenvironment , in order to simulate the delivery of therapeutic proteins targeting cancer cells and to predict the biological activity . By cross - comparing simulated and experimental data from 3D models , we were able to correctly predict the best dose needed to deliver toxic proteins speciﬁcally to tumor cells , while leaving the surrounding non - tumor cells untouched . This study shows the potential of combining computational approaches with novel in vitro models to advance the development of protein therapeutics . Abstract : To rationally improve targeted drug delivery to tumor cells , new methods combining in silico and physiologically relevant in vitro models are needed . This study combines mathematical modeling with 3D in vitro co - culture models to study the delivery of engineered proteins , called designed ankyrin repeat proteins ( DARPins ) , in biomimetic tumor microenvironments containing ﬁbroblasts and tumor cells overexpressing epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM ) or human epithelial growth factor receptor ( HER2 ) . In multicellular tumor spheroids , we observed strong binding - site barriers in combination with low apparent diffusion coefﬁcients of 1 µ m 2 · s − 1 and 2 µ m 2 · s − 1 for EpCAM - and HER2 - binding DARPin , respectively . Contrasting this , in a tumor - on - a - chip model for investigating delivery in real - time , transport was characterized by hindered diffusion as a consequence of the lower local tumor cell density . Finally , simulations of the diffusion of an EpCAM - targeting DARPin fused to a fragment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A , which speciﬁcally kills tumor cells while leaving ﬁbroblasts untouched , correctly predicted the need for concentrations of 10 nM or higher for extensive tumor cell killing on - chip , whereas in 2D models picomolar concentrations were sufﬁcient . These results illustrate the power of combining in vitro models with mathematical modeling to study and predict the protein activity in complex 3D models .

Introduction Engineered proteins including antibodies and non - immunoglobulin binding proteins that target cancer - speciﬁc features play an increasingly important role in the development of novel cancer therapies [ 1 ] . Compared with small molecules , proteins offer enhanced speciﬁcity and / or selective recognition of surface features [ 2 ] . Furthermore , their small Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / cancers13102461 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / cancers Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 2 of 19 size offers beneﬁts with respect to tissue accessibility compared with most nanoparticulate delivery systems [ 3 ] . Nevertheless , the efﬁcient delivery of therapeutic proteins into tumors can be hindered because of a binding - site barrier [ 4 ] , a high interstitial pressure as a result of poor tumor vasculature , a defective lymphatic system , and a dense extracellular matrix [ 5 ] . When the local concentration of the therapeutic agent is sublethal deep inside the tumor tissue , not only is a less efﬁcacious treatment observed , but the development of therapy resistance is also much more likely [ 6 , 7 ] . Traditionally , tumor targeting has been studied using 2D culture models and animal models . However , the aforementioned barriers to efﬁcient drug delivery are not replicated in 2D culture systems , and in vivo models suffer from a low throughput . Furthermore , in vivo models are difﬁcult to control , expensive , less suitable for real - time uptake stud - ies , and ethically problematic . In addition , there are increasing worries regarding the poor extrapolation of results from animal model outcomes to the human setting [ 8 – 10 ] . Consequently , there has been growing interest in the utilization of in vitro complex 3D tissues that mimic relevant aspects of human tumor microenvironments for studying drug delivery [ 11 , 12 ] . Multicellular tumor spheroids ( MCTS ) consisting of a cluster of tumor cells are a suitable 3D model to study drug delivery to avascular tumor regions [ 12 ] . MCTS are one of the simplest 3D models that can replicate tumor features , such as gradients of oxygen and waste products and the high density of the extracellular matrix [ 12 , 13 ] . MCTS can be generated with a high throughput and have been used to efﬁciently study the penetration of nanoparticles , antibodies , and antibody fragments in 3D [ 14 – 16 ] . Alternative models that include more complex features of the tumor microenvironment have gained more attention in recent years . In particular , microﬂuidic cancer - on - a - chip platforms , either consisting solely of cancer cells or co - cultured with stromal cells [ 17 – 21 ] , provide a physiologically more relevant 3D microenvironment because of the ability to compartmentalize and better control gradients [ 22 , 23 ] . Furthermore , cancer - on - a - chip systems also allow for real - time imaging and quantitative analyses of the biological processes in ways unachievable with current animal models . Therefore , these models have the potential for a more in - depth investigation of the transport processes of drugs , including therapeutic proteins , into and around tumor tissues , and allow for a quick evaluation of novel formats with respect to their transport behavior . Importantly , the highly controlled nature of experiments with microﬂuidic models facilitates the application of modeling approaches for the description of transport processes , which , so far , have been limited to the description of processes in either static spheroids [ 14 ] or in vivo models [ 24 – 28 ] . In this study , we investigated the speciﬁc delivery of designed ankyrin repeat proteins ( DARPins ) directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) or epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM ) in complex 3D tumor microenvironments . We included optically cleared spheroids and a microﬂuidic tumor model for real - time visualization of the tumor penetration , using 2D models as a reference . Based on our experimental setup , we also developed a mathematical model for evaluating protein delivery in spheroids and on - chip ( Figure 1 ) . We used DARPins because they are highly stable engineered proteins that can be selected to bind , with very high afﬁnities , to virtually any target [ 29 ] . Additionally , DARPins are 10 × smaller than conventional antibodies , giving them better tissue - penetration properties [ 30 ] . To investigate the speciﬁc activity towards tumor cells in our tumor - on - a - chip system , we fused DARPins to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A ( ETA ) and compared the experimental data with mathematical predictions of an adapted mathematical model considering the cell - killing activity of the agents . The predictions of the model aligned with our experimental observations regarding the expected amount of cell death throughout the microﬂuidic chip after 48 h , illustrating the potential of a hybrid approach that combines tumor - on - a - chip systems with mathematical models for investigating the transport processes and biological activities of candidate protein therapies .

Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Cell Lines and Culture Media The experiments were performed with human lung adenocarcinoma Calu - 3 cells , human mammary gland ductal carcinoma BT - 474 cells ( both ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) , and two primary human ﬁbroblast cell lines—IMR - 90 ( ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) and C5120—which were kindly donated by Dr . Rodenburg ( Radboud University Medical Cen - ter , Nijmegen , The Netherlands ) [ 31 ] . The BT - 474 cells were cultured in Gibco Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium ( RPMI ) , Calu - 3 cells in a minimum essential medium Eagle ( MEM ) , and the ﬁbroblasts in Medium 199 ( Gibco , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . All of the media were supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) . For the experiments with microﬂuidic devices , 1 % v / v penicillin - streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 4 of 19 and 2 . 5 µ g mL − 1 Amphotericin B ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) were supplemented to the media . 2 . 2 . Cloning , Expression and Conjugation of DARPins and DARPin Fusions The EpCAM - binding DARPin Ec1 and the control DARPin Off7 with an N - terminal MRGS - His6 tag and a C - terminal cysteine and FLAG tag were expressed from pQIq vec - tors in the Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) strain BLR ( DE3 ) , as described previously [ 32 ] . The HER2 - binding DARPins 9 _ 26 was similarly cloned in pQIq through BamHI and HindIII restriction sites and was expressed in BLR ( DE3 ) . The DARPins fused to the translocation and catalytic domains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A ( ETA ; aa 252 – 612 ) were gener - ated by replacing the consensus DARPin NI 3 C in Ec1 - ETA ( 252 - 412 ) - NI 3 C - KDEL with the catalytic domain of ETA through SpeI and PstI restriction sites [ 33 ] . The EpCAM - binding DARPin Ec1 was subsequently replaced by the HER2 - targeting DARPins 9 _ 26 , or the control DARPin Off7 through the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites . The DARPin - fusion proteins were expressed in the E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) essentially , as described previ - ously [ 33 ] , with the exception that a 2YT medium ( 16 g · L − 1 peptone , 10 g · L − 1 yeast extract , 5 g · L − 1 NaCl ) containing 50 µ g mL − 1 ampicillin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was used for the protein expression . DARPins were coupled to Alexa Fluor 680 ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) , as described previously [ 32 ] . The puriﬁed DARPins and DARPin - toxin fusions are shown in Figure S1A , B , and a schematic of the engineered DARPins is presented in Figure 2A , as well as the conﬁrmation of the speciﬁc binding to Calu - 3 cells in Figure 2B . 2 . 3 . Quantiﬁcation of Receptor Density The cells were detached using a 10 mM EDTA solution ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) at 4 ◦ C and were stained with a Phycoerythrin ( PE ) - labeled anti - EpCAM antibody ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA , USA ) or PE - labeled anti - HER2 antibody ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA , USA ) . A PE - labeled IgG1 isotype control antibody ( Life Technologies Carlsbad , CA , USA ) was used as a negative control . The ﬂuorescence intensity for each antibody was measured on a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 ﬂow cytometer ( Miltenyi , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) , and a calibration curve was generated using the BD QuantiBrite™ PE ﬂuorescence quantitation kit ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The data were analyzed with FlowJo 10 . 0 . 8rl ( BD Life Sciences , Ashland , OR , USA ) . For quantifying the receptor number ( Figure S2 ) , we utilized the median of the whole cell population for EpCAM , whereas for the quantiﬁcation of HER2 receptor density , we used the median of the positive cell population because of inhomogeneous staining . Through staining with receptor - targeting DARPins , we could conﬁrm the homogeneous expression of HER2 on the cell lines ( Calu - 3 : Figure 2C , BT - 474 : Figure S3 ) , which led us to conclude that staining with the commercial antibodies was incomplete . Staining with DARPins also supported the similar number of binding sites found for EpCAM and HER2 on BT - 474 cells ( Figure S3 ) . 2 . 4 . Determination of Binding of DARPin to Cell Surface Receptors Calu - 3 , BT - 474 , and IMR - 90 cells were seeded in 24 - well culture plates . The cells were grown overnight and subsequently incubated for 2 h with Alexa Fluor 680 - labeled anti - EpCAM or anti - HER2 DARPins at 37 ◦ C . The cells were then washed twice with PBS and detached with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA for Calu - 3 and BT - 474 . The IMR - 90 cells required detachment with trypsin . The cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min and resuspended in PBS . The cells were measured using the MACSQuant Analyzer 10 ﬂow cytometer ( Miltenyi , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) , and the data were analyzed with FlowJo 10 . 0 . 8rl ( BD Life Sciences , Ashland , OR , USA ) .

The HER2 - binding DARPins 9 _ 26 was similarly cloned in pQIq through BamHI and HindIII re - striction sites and was expressed in BLR ( DE3 ) . The DARPins fused to the translocation and catalytic domains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A ( ETA ; aa 252 – 612 ) were gen - erated by replacing the consensus DARPin NI 3 C in Ec1 - ETA ( 252 - 412 ) - NI 3 C - KDEL with the catalytic domain of ETA through SpeI and PstI restriction sites [ 33 ] . The EpCAM - bind - ing DARPin Ec1 was subsequently replaced by the HER2 - targeting DARPins 9 _ 26 , or the control DARPin Off7 through the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites .

DARPins were coupled to Alexa Fluor 680 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , United States ) , as described previously [ 32 ] . The purified DARPins and DARPin - toxin fusions are shown in Figure S1A , B , and a schematic of the engineered DARPins is presented in Figure 2A , as well as the confirmation of the specific binding to Calu - 3 cells in Figure 2B .

Speciﬁc DARPin Binding to Tumor Cells in Co - Cultures Calu - 3 cells and IMR - 90 cells were stained with carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester ( CFSE ) or CellTrace yellow ( both from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) , respectively . The cells were seeded at a density of 50 , 000 cells / well for Calu - 3 and 30 , 000 cells / well for IMR - 90 in µ - slide eight - well chambers ( Ibidi , Gräfelﬁng , Ger - many ) . Co - cultures were grown overnight and subsequently incubated for 2 h with various DARPin - Alexa Fluor 680 conjugates at 500 nM for 2 h . The cells were washed with com - plete medium ( Medium 199 , Life Technologies Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and images were taken with an HC PL APO 63x / 1 . 20 N . A . water immersion objective on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) . 2 . 6 . Toxicity of DARPin - Toxin Fusions Calu - 3 cells were seeded in a 96 - well plate at a density of 20 , 000 cells / well . The cells were grown overnight and incubated for 48 h with DARPins fused to the translocation and catalytic domains of ETA . The cells were then either incubated with a 0 . 1 mg · mL − 1 Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 6 of 19 resazurin working solution in complete medium and incubated for 2 h , or grown for 96 h more before being incubated with resazurin . Afterwards , ﬂuorescence was measured with 525 – 540 nm excitation and 620 – 640 nm emission light on a BioTek Synergy 2 Multi - Mode Reader ( BioTek Instruments , Winooski , VT , USA ) . The relative viability was calculated from the ﬂuorescent signals by subtracting the resazurin background signal and normalizing to untreated cells . 2 . 7 . DARPin Penetration into Tumor Spheroids BT - 474 spheroids were produced via the hanging - drop method by pipetting drops of 30 µ L with 5000 cells , as described previously [ 20 ] . Spheroids were allowed to form overnight at 37 ◦ C in an incubator with 5 % CO 2 . The DARPins were added in 1 . 5 µ L to the 30 µ L drops with the spheroid and were incubated for the indicated times at 37 ◦ C . Spheroids were ﬁxated for 2 h in 4 % ( w / v ) PFA ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) and kept in 2 % PFA overnight at 4 ◦ C . The spheroids were washed and embedded in a 20 µ L drop of collagen solution ( 4 mg · mL − 1 ) in an eight - well IBIDI chamber ( Gräfelﬁng , Germany ) . The IBIDI chamber was kept at room temperature for 5 min , after which the collagen was polymerized for 40 min at 37 ◦ C . A modiﬁed SeeDB protocol was employed for clearing , as described previously [ 20 ] . Confocal images were taken with an HCX PL APO 40x / 0 . 85 dry objective or an HCX PL APO 10x / 0 . 40 dry objective on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) . 2 . 8 . Quantiﬁcation of DARPin Penetration Depth in Tumor Spheroids A python - based macro for Fiji [ 34 ] was created and used to quantify the penetration depth of the ﬂuorescently labeled DARPins into the BT - 474 spheroids ( Supplementary Methods ) . The slice representing the widest cross - section , and hence the maximum distance from spheroid rim to its center , was used for the quantiﬁcation of penetration . First , the region of interest ( ROI ) was manually selected around the spheroid . After determining the ROI center , 360 radial lines covering 360 ◦ were drawn from the center to the border of the ROI . Next , a Gaussian blur was applied before determining the signal intensity along the lines . The maximum intensity values determined for 360 lines were averaged . The half - maximal intensity was calculated , which was set as the rim of the spheroid , and was used to determine the distance of penetration . To determine the spheroid size , the radii were averaged . Tumor penetration was expressed as a percentage of the relative penetration from the outer rim of the spheroid . 2 . 9 . Fabrication of Tumor - on - a - Chip A design similar to the one reported by Chernyavska et al . was employed , composed of three parallel channels on glass on a device fabricated utilizing replica - molded poly - dimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ; Dow Corning , Midland , MI , USA ) [ 20 ] . In this case , the spheroid traps were removed from the central chamber and 5 mm holes were punched to make the reservoirs connected to the side channels , using a biopsy puncher ( Kai Industries , Seki , Gifu , Japan ) . All of the manufacturing steps were performed as reported previously [ 20 ] . 2 . 10 . Real - Time DARPin Penetration in the Tumor - on - a - Chip System Co - cultures of IMR - 90 or C5120 ﬁbroblasts were labeled according to the manufac - turer’s instructions with CellTrace yellow , and CellTrace violet was used for the BT - 474 cells . The labeled cells were then embedded in a 10 mg · mL − 1 Matrigel ( Corning , Corning , NY , USA ) matrix and loaded manually in the tumor compartment of the microﬂuidic chip at a density of 2 . 0 × 10 7 cells mL − 1 . The chips were placed in the incubator at 37 ◦ C ) for 15 min to allow the Matrigel to polymerize . After this time , a medium was added in the side channels and each of the four reservoirs were ﬁlled with the same volume of medium . We compared the Matrigel with collagen ( 4 mg · mL − 1 ) , but under the evaluated circum - stances , we noted signiﬁcant contraction of the collagen gel . After 48 h , protein diffusion through the Matrigel matrix and the speciﬁc targeting of cancer cells was investigated by Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 7 of 19 adding Alexa Fluor 680 - labeled DARPins in one of the side channels and ﬁlling up the two reservoirs with the exact same volume of medium immediately before imaging . Using the LASX software ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) with a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) equipped with an HCX PL APO 10x / 0 . 40 dry objective ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) , one position per chip was selected and time lapses were recorded by taking an image of each marked position every 1 min for 1 h . For the image analyses and subsequent comparisons with the simulated data , Fiji was used . The Matrigel region of the middle channel was manually selected and plot proﬁles of ﬂuorescence intensity across this channel were generated for the images at 0 , 15 , 30 , 45 , and 60 min . The intensity values were converted to concentrations using an averaged background - corrected maximum value in the side channel and the concentration at which DARPins were added ( 500 nM ) . We assumed a linear relationship between the ﬂuorescence intensity and concentration . For the toxicity studies in the tumor - on - a - chip , BT - 474 cells labeled with CFSE and C5120 ﬁbroblasts labeled with CellTrace violet were grown in the chip for 24 h . After this , DARPin - ETA fusions were added to one of the side channels of the chip at concentrations of 1 or 10 nM . The cell viability after 48 h of culture was determined by adding the cell death staining propidium iodide ( PI ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) into the chips and through quantiﬁcation , as described below . 2 . 11 . Quantiﬁcation of Cell Death in Tumor - on - a - Chip System To quantify the relative amount of cell death of each cell type in the tumor - on - a - chip after treatment with the DARPin - toxin fusions , a macro in Fiji was developed ( Supplemen - tary Methods ) . Brieﬂy , each channel was ﬁltered using a Gaussian blur . A threshold was applied to the images and the positive area corresponding to the cells or the PI staining was converted into a region of interest ( ROI ) . The ROIs corresponding to one cell channel and PI were overlapped , and a ROI of the overlapping areas was created . Subsequently , the percentage of the overlapping area compared to the total cell area in the threshold image was calculated . The relative amount of cell death ( based on surface area ) was then reported as the ratio of the overlapping area between the PI channel and the cell channel . 2 . 12 . Confocal Microscopy Imaging Settings CellTrace Violet was excited at 405 nm ( detection : 413 – 460 nm ) , CFSE at 492 nm ( detection : 500 – 520 nm ) , CellTrace Yellow at 546 nm ( detection : 554 – 580 nm ) , and CytoTell Red at 647 nm ( detection : 656 – 750 nm ) . The Alexa Fluor 680 - labeled DARPins were excited at 679 nm ( detection : 688 – 720 nm ) and propidium iodide at 535 nm ( detection : 543 – 620 nm ) . 2 . 13 . Mathematical Model of DARPins Diffusion In Vitro A binding - diffusion mathematical model was implemented by introducing the cus - tom governing equations ( Equations ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) ) in the ﬁnite element software COMSOL Multiphysics v5 . 5 ( Stockholm , Sweden ) using the equation - based interface . A schematic of the input variables related to the therapy and the tissue , as well as the modelled out - comes , is given in Figure S4 . The underlying coupled equations were initially reported by Thurber et al . [ 14 ] and Torres et al .

D is the DARPin diffusion coefﬁcient in ECM and was determined experimentally ( Figure S5A ) ; ε is the interstitial volume fraction ( see below for how values were acquired ) ; and k on , k off , and k e are the binding , release , and endocytosis rate constants of the receptors , respectively and were taken from the literature ( Table 1 ) . Re 0 is the receptor concentration at t = 0 . Note that the binding terms k on and k off must be divided by the available interstitial volume fraction for the interstitial diffusion , referred to as the void fraction ( ε ) , because Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 9 of 19 the DARPin – receptor interactions only occur in the space accessible to DARPins . ε is calculated as follows , ε = V _ ECM / V _ total , where V refers to volume and ECM to the extracellular matrix . We considered the cells to be immobile , so that among the three variables , only Da can diffuse ( D not equal to zero ) . The following two distinct assumptions could be made for the receptor regeneration term of R s : ( i ) If cells are not killed during DARPin diffusion , all receptors are recycled , R s = k e ( Re + B ) . This assumption was taken when investigating the delivery of non - toxic DARPins . ( ii ) If cells are killed , internalized DARPin – receptor complexes are no longer recycled , R s = k e Re . This assumption was taken when investigating the delivery of fusion toxins , i . e . , DARPins fused to a fragment of the bacterial toxin ETA . Transient simulations were performed to predict the concentration proﬁles over time in both spheroids and tumor - on - chip systems . Diffusion inside the spheroids was modelled on a spherical geometry , as shown in Figure 1A . The model was simpliﬁed into a 1D problem by taking the spherical coordinates’ expression for the Laplace operator . For the boundary conditions , a constant surrounding the DARPin concentration was assumed at the sphere border , and zero - ﬂux was assumed at the center ( r = 0 ) , so as to consider the spherical symmetry . The void fraction for modeling the delivery in spheroids was taken from the literature ( Table 1 ) . The tumor - on - chip model was solved on a 3D geometry , as shown in Figure 1B . To consider the presence of cells in the matrix , distinct values for the void fraction and diffusion coefﬁcient ( D water and D ECM ) were used for the tumor compartment and the side channel . The void fraction for modeling the delivery in the tumor - on - a - chip model was estimated by subtracting the volume occupied by CellTrace yellow - stained BT – 474 cells in a Z - stack from top to bottom in the central tumor compartment from the total measured tumor compartment volume in the same Z - stack . The side channels are connected to the middle compartment by smaller channels that are 100 µ m long , 20 µ m × 20 µ m wide , and 40 µ m spaced . All of the boundaries were deﬁned with a zero - ﬂux condition , except for the side walls ( normal to y - axis ) , which were set as symmetric . The initial conditions are shown in Figure 1B . To determine the diffusion coefﬁcient of DARPins in the ECM for the tumor - on - chip model , we performed simulations for the non - binding Off7 DARPin with different values for the diffusion coefﬁcient . We then chose the value that provided the best ﬁtting with experiments through a least - squares minimization method ( Figure S5A ) . The obtained value , of 55 µ m 2 · s − 1 , was kept for the subsequent simulations with binding DARPins , assuming a comparable hydrodynamic radius for each . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Speciﬁcity of DARPins and Toxicity of DARPin - Toxin Fusion Proteins in 2D Model Systems As a reference point for the evaluation in 3D tumor models , we started by investigating the binding speciﬁcity of DARPins and the cell - selective toxicity of DARPin - toxin fusions in ﬂat 2D monolayer systems . We used DARPin 9 _ 26 , which binds to HER2 with a a dissociation constant ( K d ) of 1 . 4 nM [ 35 ] , and EpCAM - binding DARPin Ec1 , which binds to EpCAM with a K d of 68 pM [ 36 ] , including the non - binding control Off7 ( Figure S1A ) . DARPins were produced with a unique cysteine for ﬂuorescent labeling or were fused to a fragment of ETA consisting of the translocation domain and the catalytic domain ( Figure 2A and Figure S1B ) . DARPin - toxin fusions are highly potent receptor - targeted fusion toxins [ 39 ] . We used the human breast carcinoma cell line BT - 474 and the human lung carci - noma cell line Calu - 3 as model cancer cell lines , which both overexpress HER2 and Ep - CAM [ 40 – 42 ] . The number of EpCAM and HER2 molecules on the cell surface of both cell lines was quantiﬁed using ﬂow cytometry . An average of 3 . 86 × 10 5 ± 4 . 8 × 10 4 EpCAM molecules / cell was quantiﬁed for BT - 474 and 2 . 58 × 10 5 ± 9 . 9 × 10 3 EpCAM molecules / cell for Calu - 3 ( Figure S2A ) . For HER2 , the expression on BT - 474 and Calu - 3 was found to be 3 . 15 × 10 5 ( range : 3 . 04 – 3 . 27 × 10 5 ) molecules / cell and 1 . 59 × 10 5 ( range : Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 10 of 19 1 . 54 – 1 . 62 × 10 5 ) molecules / cell , respectively ( Figure S2B ) . Primary lung or skin ﬁbroblasts ( IMR - 90 and C5120 , respectively ) were included in order to investigate the cancer cell speciﬁcity . C5120 is reported to be low on EpCAM [ 20 ] and HER2 [ 31 ] , and we found the same for IMR - 90 ( Figure S2A , B ) . HER2 - binding 9 _ 26 and the EpCAM - binding DARPin Ec1 showed a clear membrane staining and some vesicular uptake when incubated with Calu - 3 cells ( Figure 2B ) . The control DARPin Off7 showed very low non - speciﬁc signals . The speciﬁc binding of the DARPins was further quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry ( Figure 2C and Figure S3 ) , which conﬁrmed the highly speciﬁc binding of Ec1 and 9 _ 26 , but not of the control Off7 . In co - cultures of IMR - 90 ﬁbroblasts and Calu - 3 tumor cells , a speciﬁc binding of Ec1 and 9 _ 26 to tumor cells was observed ( Figure 2D ) . No enrichment of the non - binding control DARPin on the tumor cells was seen . Additionally , we evaluated the toxicity towards the cancer cell lines of DARPin - toxin fusions containing either 9 _ 26 , Ec1 , or Off7 after 48 h ( Figure 2E ) . We observed a 75 % reduction in cell viability for both targeted fusion toxins , already at subnanomolar concentrations . To conﬁrm that the residual viability was due to the short incubation period , we incubated cells for 48 h with fusions toxins , washed away the fusion toxins , and incubated them for an additional 72 h . At that time point , the targeted toxin mediated 100 % tumor cell killing already at 10 pM , whereas the control fusion toxin showed no toxicity ( Figure S6 ) . 3 . 2 . DARPin Delivery in 3D Multicellular Tumor Spheroids ( MCTS ) To evaluate the potential of mathematical modeling to predict DARPin diffusion in multicellular tumor spheroids ( MCTS ) , we simulated DARPin delivery using a mathemati - cal model similar to the one reported by Torres et al . for the investigation of in vivo protein delivery [ 28 ] . MCTS are a reliable 3D in vitro model for simulating the features of avascular tumors , including a binding - site barrier , because of a high receptor density . Optical clearing allows for the visualization of ﬂuorescence throughout the entire spheroid using confocal microscopy [ 20 , 32 ] . Given our knowledge on most of the quantiﬁable parameters determin - ing tumor penetration ( Table 1 ) , the unknown variable in our model for ﬁtting variation in the speed of penetration is the apparent diffusion coefﬁcient . We refer to this value as the apparent diffusion coefﬁcient , because it takes into account the tortuosity of diffusion in the spheroid and is thus lower than the true diffusion . We simulated the tumor penetration of Ec1 and 9 _ 26 at 500 nM and 100 nM in BT - 474 spheroids with diffusion coefﬁcients ranging between 0 . 5 to 10 µ m 2 · s − 1 . For Ec1 at 500 nM , the simulations yielded a full penetration after ~ 5 . 5 h with an estimated diffusion coefﬁcient of 1 . 0 µ m 2 · s − 1 ( Table 1 ) , which agreed with the experimental data , and at 100 nM , a full penetration of the spheroids would occur after ~ 2 h at a diffusion coefﬁcient of 10 µ m 2 · s − 1 ( Figure 3B ) . For 9 _ 26 at 500 nM , the model predicted that , contrary to Ec1 , even with a diffusion coefﬁcient of 2 . 0 µ m 2 · s − 1 , complete penetration of the spheroids would take even more than 6 h ( Figure 3C ) . The different diffusion behaviors reﬂect mostly differences in receptor internalization rates . When simulating penetration at 100 nM for both DARPins , the binding - site barrier was more evident , showing that for 9 _ 26 , the simulated diffusion coefﬁcients were not sufﬁcient to reach the core of the spheroids within the 6 h time frame ( Figure 3D ) , whereas for Ec1 , only a diffusion coefﬁcient of 10 µ m 2 · s − 1 would achieve full penetration ( Figure 3B ) . To experimentally validate our model , we investigated DARPin diffusion into tu - mors and observed similar time - dependent patterns of diffusion into the spheroids for both the EpCAM - targeting DARPin Ec1 and the HER2 - targeting DARPin 9 _ 26 at 500 nM ( Figure 3E , F ) . In a matter of hours , DARPins moved to the core of the spheroid , exhibiting the predicted “frozen front” at each time point , consistent with the presence of a binding - site barrier [ 14 ] . After 6 h , Ec1 had fully penetrated the spheroid and 9 _ 26 had reached about 90 – 95 % . A lower concentration of 100 nM showed a slower - moving front , and not a generally lower signal ( Figure 3E , G ) . For Ec1 , the simulations were most similar to experimental data assuming a diffusion coefﬁcient of 1 . 0 µ m 2 · s − 1 , whereas for 9 _ 26 , a Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 11 of 19 simulation employing a diffusion coefﬁcient of 2 . 0 µ m 2 · s − 1 was most accurate for 500 nM , while at 100 nM , a faster apparent diffusion coefﬁcient would be needed ( Figure 3A – D ) . Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 11 of 19 3D ) , whereas for Ec1 , only a diffusion coefficient of 10 µm 2 ·s − 1 would achieve full penetra - tion ( Figure 3B ) . Figure 3 .

Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 12 of 19 These results illustrate the potential for combining simulations of protein delivery in spheroids with optical clearing protocols for an accurate assessment of tumor penetration , allowing us to predict the effects of concentration and afﬁnity on successful delivery , while also serving as an important validation step before moving to more complex microﬂu - idic models . 3 . 3 . DARPin Delivery in 3D in a Microﬂuidic Tumor - on - a - Chip Model To be able to study DARPin delivery in real - time , we utilized a microﬂuidic tumor - on - a - chip approach in conjunction with simulations . The ability to compartmentalize allows for precise control over the interface between the 3D tumor tissue and the drug solution , thus enabling an accurate real - time study of tumor penetration in a 3D tumor microen - vironment . Here , we focused on transport by diffusion , mimicking tumor regions where little to no interstitial ﬂow is present ( Figure 4A ) . In the microﬂuidic device , ﬂuorescently labeled DARPins added in the medium reservoirs diffused from the side channels into the main tumor compartment containing BT - 474 cells ( Figure 4B ) , and could be followed in real - time during 1 h using confocal microscopy ( Figure 4C ) . The modeling approach for the tumor - on - a - chip can be used to simulate the transport behavior and ﬁt observed behavior in order to extract the apparent diffusion coefﬁcients ( Figure 4D – G ) . We estimated the diffusion coefﬁcient for DARPins in the tumor tissue by ﬁtting the diffusion proﬁle of the non - binding DARPin Off7 to the simulated results of a range of diffusion coefﬁcients ( Figure S5A ) , yielding an estimate of 55 ± 5 µ m 2 s − 1 , which is much higher than the diffusion constants in spheroids with high cell densities . In both the simulations and experimental data of Ec1 ( Figure 4D ) and 9 _ 26 ( Figure 4E ) , we observed slower transport into the tissue as a consequence of the predicted DARPin – receptor interactions . To assess the goodness of ﬁt , we calculated the average relative error between the simulated and experimental curves for Off7 , 9 _ 26 , and Ec1 ( Figure S5B – D ) . The ﬁt was markedly better compared with a model without binding for 9 _ 26 ( Figure S5E , F ) and Ec1 ( Figure S5G , H ) . Evidently , there was no “frozen front” reﬂecting a strong binding - site barrier as observed in the spheroids . Instead , the transport behavior of the DARPins in the tumor tissue on - chip , with a lower cell density compared with spheroids , can be best described as hindered diffusion . The model was further adapted for the delivery of agents that have toxic effects . Unlike ﬂuorescently labeled agents that are constitutively endocytosed , the receptor regenerated cells that take up toxic agents will eventually be killed , thereby halting receptor regeneration and affecting the kinetics of the protein distribution . In the adapted model that assumed no receptor regeneration as a proxy for cell killing , we predicted the protein diffusion of 0 . 1 , 1 , and 10 nM of the targeted fusion toxins ( Figure 5A ) . Given the extremely potent toxic effects of DARPin - toxin fusions [ 39 ] , we assumed that the remaining free receptor levels reﬂect the cell viability . The predictions indicated that extensive cell killing would occur only at 10 nM or higher . To compare the simulated data against the experimental data , we tested the activity of the DARPin - ETA fusion toxins in co - cultures of tumor cells with C5120 ﬁbroblasts ( 1 : 1 ratio ) in the microﬂuidic model . As our simulation predicted very little toxicity up to 1 nM , the co - cultures were incubated with 1 nM or 10 nM of Ec1 - ETA DARPin and 10 nM of Off7 ETA - DARPin as a negative control . At 10 nM , but not at 1 nM , we observed a signiﬁcant 10 - fold increase in cell death , as reﬂected by the overlapping PI area in BT - 474 cells , compared with the controls of Off7 - ETA and the controls without DARPin ( Figure 5B ) , consistent with the prediction from our simulations . Furthermore , Ec1 - ETA showed a speciﬁc killing towards high EpCAM - expressing BT - 474 tumor cells , but not towards low EpCAM - expressing ﬁbroblasts in the tumor - on - a - chip ( Figure 5B , C ) .

Discussion In this study , we illustrated a hybrid approach that combines the simulation of pro - tein behavior in 3D tumor tissues with an experimental investigation of tumor - targeted DARPins and DARPin - toxin fusion using spheroids and in real - time using a microfluidic tumor - on - a - chip model . There is still a limited understanding of the dynamics of transport and binding inter - actions of protein - based targeted agents in complex tumor tissues , which is crucial for designing and evaluating novel therapeutic approaches for optimal target engagement in vivo [ 43 ] . We focused on spheroids that represent dense , solid avascular tumors with a high interstitial pressure , which often exhibit a layer - by - layer uptake of protein therapeu - tics and a binding - site barrier . Alternatively , we used tumors - on - chips to represent sce - narios where the cells are more loosely associated and more prone to metastasize . Mathematical modeling approaches have a long history in drug delivery research , though the large majority has been focused on nanoparticles [ 44 , 45 ] . In contrast , pharma - cokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling has long been used for predicting the overall re - ceptor occupancy of protein - based therapeutics in order to guide dose selection in hu - mans , but these provide little mechanistic insights at the level of the tumor tissue [ 46 ] .

There is still a limited understanding of the dynamics of transport and binding in - teractions of protein - based targeted agents in complex tumor tissues , which is crucial for designing and evaluating novel therapeutic approaches for optimal target engagement in vivo [ 43 ] . We focused on spheroids that represent dense , solid avascular tumors with a high interstitial pressure , which often exhibit a layer - by - layer uptake of protein thera - peutics and a binding - site barrier . Alternatively , we used tumors - on - chips to represent scenarios where the cells are more loosely associated and more prone to metastasize . Mathematical modeling approaches have a long history in drug delivery research , though the large majority has been focused on nanoparticles [ 44 , 45 ] . In contrast , phar - macokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling has long been used for predicting the overall Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 15 of 19 receptor occupancy of protein - based therapeutics in order to guide dose selection in hu - mans , but these provide little mechanistic insights at the level of the tumor tissue [ 46 ] . Very recently , Tang et al . reported an investigation of the dynamics of antibody - target binding in tumor tissue in vivo . Notably , they reported large differences between k on and k off , as measured by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) and apparent rates obtained after ﬁtting the model with in vivo data , as well as very large differences in apparent k off rates between stroma - rich and stroma - poor tumor regions . As the model was compartmental , diffusional hindrances were not explicitly modeled in their approach , which could have contributed to the observed slow on - and slow off - rates in the stroma - rich tumor region , as also indicated by the authors [ 47 ] . Their approach differs from our approach , where we assumed ﬁxed k off rates and ﬁtted the data according to apparent diffusion coefﬁcients in a spatiotemporal fashion , allowing for an analysis of the gradients . Our modeling approach is more similar to the approaches followed previously by Thurber and Wittrup , who performed a spatiotemporal investigation of the tumor delivery and binding - site barrier of targeted proteins in vitro [ 14 ] , and Torres et . al , who performed a theoretical investigation of in vivo protein delivery [ 28 ] . In agreement with their ﬁndings , we observed a binding - site barrier on the outside of the spheroids when using tumor cells that overexpress membrane molecules such as EpCAM or HER2 , and DARPins against these targets . The “frozen front” moves in predictable ways as a function of concentration and time , as has also recently been found in other contexts by us and several other groups who have studied the penetration of binding proteins in spheroids [ 14 , 32 , 48 , 49 ] . When ﬁtting the experimental data of the DARPin diffusion in the spheroids , the model predicted diffusion coefﬁcients of 1 µ m 2 · s − 1 for Ec1 and 2 µ m 2 · s − 1 for 9 _ 26 . It must be noted that these values rely on reported internalization rates in 2D cultures , which may be different from those in 3D tumor tissues [ 37 , 38 ] . It is noteworthy that the diffusion coefﬁcients we found were low when compared with the 33 µ m 2 · s − 1 reported by Thurber and Wittrup for a single - chain antibody fragment in tumor tissue [ 14 ] . Factors that could decrease the diffusion coefﬁcient of the DARPins in the spheroids are related to the density of the collagen or methylcellulose within the spheroids , the cell density and the tightness of the cell – cell junctions [ 50 ] . In Thurber and Wittrup’s system , the same spheroid size was obtained with ten times fewer cells , which may have yielded more loosely associated spheroids in which proteins can diffuse faster . In the microﬂuidic tumor - on - a - chip model , tumor cells grow at a much lower density , explaining the much higher estimated diffusion coefﬁcient of 55 ± 5 µ m 2 · s − 1 . This latest value is similar to what would be expected in a relatively dense tumor tissue in vivo for a similarly sized molecule , reﬂecting , for instance , U87 and HSTS26T tumors grown in vivo in a mouse dorsal chamber [ 51 ] . Of note , even though the Matrigel used in this study is mostly a mixture of laminin , collagen IV , and enactin , and reﬂects a basement membrane [ 52 ] , while in tumor tissues it is mostly collagen that lowers the diffusion coefﬁcient [ 51 ] , the transport properties of DARPins in cell - dense tumor tissues can be investigated properly when diffusion coefﬁcients match what is found in vivo and speciﬁc binding to matrix components plays a negligible role , as is expected for hydrophilic DARPins with highly speciﬁc recognition surfaces . In contrast with the spheroids model , the tumor - on - a - chip system is a model that allows for the investigation of tumors with lower cell densities , in which the accessibility depends , to a large degree , on the porosity of the ECM that causes diffusional hindrance [ 51 ] . In these kinds of tumors , the proteins will face diffusion through the extracellular matrix as a main challenge , a notorious problem especially in pancreatic adenocarcinomas [ 53 ] . Hence , the proteins will experience a hindered diffusion through the 3D matrix , which is in line with the simulations of our mathematical model , and which is distinct from the frozen front observed by us and others in spheroids . The developed model was also employed to simulate the transport of a DARPin fused to a toxin , which speciﬁcally binds and selectively kills tumor cells in the microﬂuidic device . This combined approach can lead us to better study the speciﬁc delivery of protein therapies in a complex 3D system , while Cancers 2021 , 13 , 2461 16 of 19 also predicting the minimally needed concentration for optimal therapeutic effects . Further applications of our approach can bring us closer towards rational therapeutic protein design . Combined with developments in high - throughput production and approaches towards de novo protein design with desired properties [ 54 ] , faster in vitro testing using microﬂuidic organ - on - chip technologies could help with predicting and developing novel and more powerful therapies that can be tested more rapidly and be faster translated to the patient [ 55 ] . 5 . Conclusions To summarize , the key achievement of this study is the illustration of the power of a hybrid approach that combines the use of biomimetic in vitro tumor models with mathematical models to study and predict protein delivery and activity in complex 3D systems . Our hybrid approach has great potential for the development of novel potential protein therapies , as it in part sidesteps the extrapolation challenges from 2D or animal models to complex human physiology by efﬁciently combining in silico approaches with biologically relevant in vitro test systems .
