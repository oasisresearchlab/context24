A R T I C L E S 242 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 3 MARCH 2004 NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Clathrin - mediated endocytosis occurs constitutively in all metazoan cells and is crucially involved in a variety of cellular activities ranging from the continuous uptake of nutrients to the modulation of signal transduction during cell division and differentiation 1 , 2 . Clathrin - mediated internalization begins with the redistribution of selected transmembrane receptors into a region of the plasma membrane coated on the cytosolic face with a polyhedral clathrin lattice . The coat progressively invaginates , finally budding off into the cytoplasm as a clathrin - coated vesicle . Free coated vesicles are then rapidly uncoated before fusing with the early endosome compartment 1 – 3 . Although clathrin is the main component of budding vesicles , it offers only a mechanical scaffold and , alone , is incapable of selecting cargo . This task is managed by a number of adaptors , the major one at the plasma membrane being the heterotetrameric assembly polypep - tide complex AP - 2 ( refs . 3 , 4 ) , which acts alongside several cargo - specific adaptors such as ARH and Disabled - 2 ( ref . 4 ) . Many other so - called accessory proteins have also been implicated in the spatial and temporal regulation of endocytosis from the cell surface , including AAK1 and GAK , AP180 / CALM , epsin , the amphiphysins and dynamin 3 – 11 . Most of these proteins bind directly to clathrin via a clathrin - box motif ( L Φ X Φ [ DE ] , where Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid , X is any amino acid and brackets enclose alternatives ) , to the plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , and to the C - terminal appendage domains of the α and β 2 subunits of AP - 2 via D Φ F or FXDXF motifs 4 , 8 , 12 . Clathrin cycles between two forms , soluble triskelia and polymer - ized coats . The individual triskelion is composed of three identical 190 - kDa clathrin heavy chains and three ∼ 25 - kDa light chains 1 , 8 , 13 . The C - terminal third of the heavy chain mediates trimerization and also binds a light chain . In the trimer , each heavy chain leg projects radially from a central vertex , splayed ∼ 120° apart , and is a superhelix of repeated short α - helices , whose axes are perpendicular to the length of the leg 14 . The N - terminal third of the heavy chain , the TD , consists of a seven - bladed β - propeller and a flexible helical linker 15 . The L Φ X Φ [ DE ] clathrin box binds to the outer radial surface , in a diagonal groove located between blades 1 and 2 of the β - propeller 16 , 17 . All the accessory proteins have been thought to bind to and compete for the same binding site on clathrin , despite the presence of other potential binding sites on the TD surface 8 . Biochemical studies have , however , indicated that at least one binding sequence , PWDLW , which is found in the amphiphysin family , binds the TD without competing with the canonical L Φ X Φ [ DE ] clathrin box 18 – 20 , suggesting the presence of a second motif - binding site . The aim of this work is to understand at the molecular level the interaction between amphiphysin ( PWDLW sequence ) and clathrin . We present here the crystal structure at a resolution of 2 . 3 Å of the complex between bovine clathrin TD and a peptide derived from human amphiphysin 1 , TLPWDLWTT , designated the W box . Structure - based mutagenesis verifies that the W box binds at a com - pletely different location from the binding site of the L Φ X Φ [ DE ] clathrin box 17 , in a complementary - shaped pocket on the top surface of the propeller . We propose a model for simultaneous noncompeti - tive binding of the W and clathrin boxes . This would enable amphiphysin to displace other endocytic accessory proteins that bind 1 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Hills Road , Cambridge CB2 2QH , UK . 2 Cambridge Institute for Medical Research , University of Cambridge , Wellcome Trust / MRC building , Hills Road , Cambridge CB2 2XY , UK . 3 Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15261 , USA . 4 Present address : Department of Biochemical Sciences , University of Rome La Sapienza , Piazzale Aldo Moro 5 , 00185 Rome , Italy .

The 2 . 3 Å – resolution structure of the clathrin TD in complex with a TLPWDLWTT peptide from amphiphysin 1 delineates a second clathrin - binding motif , PWXXW ( the W box ) , that binds at a site on the TD remote from the clathrin box – binding site . The presence of both sequence motifs within the unstructured region of the amphiphysins allows them to bind more tightly to free TDs than do other endocytic proteins that contain only clathrin - box motifs . This property , along with the propensity of the N - terminal BAR domain to bind curved membranes , will preferentially localize amphiphysin and its partner , dynamin , to the periphery of invaginated clathrin lattices . © 2004 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t s t r u c t m o l b i o l A R T I C L E S NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOLUME 11 NUMBER 3 MARCH 2004 243 to clathrin only via a clathrin box , and so to recruit dynamin , which binds to the C - terminal Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain of amphiphysin , to the constricting neck of a coated vesicle during the final stages of its formation . RESULTSOverview of the structure of the complex Bovine clathrin TD ( residues 1 – 363 ) in complex with the peptide TLPWDLWTT derived from amphiphysin 1 produced only one usable crystal , which diffracted to beyond a resolution of 2 . 3 Å . It belonged to the space group P 4 1 2 1 2 with two complexes in the asymmetric unit . The structure ( Fig . 1a , b ) was solved by molecular replacement using the rat clathrin TD as a model ( PDB entry 1C9I ) 17 . The structure of the β - propeller and the adjoining short α - helical segment of rat and bovine TD ( 100 % sequence identity ) superimpose with an r . m . s . deviation of 0 . 95 Å for main chain atoms . Differences may be attributed to the different crystal form and to the lower resolution of the original structure . The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are positioned head to head ( Fig . 1c ) , related by a pseudo two - fold axis , and are superimposable with an overall r . m . s . deviation of 0 . 25 Å . Density was visible for residues 4 – 355 in one molecule ( chain A ) and for residues 3 – 355 in the other ( chain B ) . The loop ( residues 171 – 175 ) is poorly ordered in both chains , and has different conformations in the two molecules . Electron density for one peptide bound to each mole - cule appeared clearly from the early maps ( Fig . 1d ) . The central part of the bound peptide is well defined in both molecules , but the C termini ( despite being present as shown by mass spectrometry ; data not shown ) have poor electron density , presumably owing to high mobility . Consequently , only the first seven residues of the peptides , namely TLPWDLW ( labeled P1 – P7 below ) , were used in the refinement . The final model contained 6 , 016 atoms ( 2 TDs , 2 heptapeptides and Figure 1 Overall structure of the bovine clathrin TD in complex with the W - box peptide ( TLPWDLWTT ) from human amphiphysin 1 .

The peptide fits into a deep pocket in the center of the top surface of the TD seven - bladed β - propeller ( Fig . 2 ) . The interaction surface is spatially distinct from the groove between blades 1 and 2 where clathrin - box peptides bind 17 ( Fig . 1a , b ) . The two sites are separated by ∼ 20 – 25 Å , which could be spanned by an extended polypeptide chain of at least eight residues . The top site is formed essentially by nine residues belonging to the upper part of blades 1 , 4 , 6 and 7 and has good shape complementarity with the pep - tide ( Fig . 2 ) . The heptapeptide has a compact 3 10 - helix conformation held together by two main chain hydrogen bonds ( ProP3 O . . . LeuP6 N , TrpP4 O . . . TrpP7 N ) and a main chain – side chain bond from LeuP2 O to TrpP7 NE1 , perhaps assisted by ProP3 , which packs onto LeuP6 . The major contacts with the protein are hydrophobic : TrpP4 is deeply buried at the bottom of the pocket , with TrpP7 in a shallower depression to the side ( partly involving the poorly ordered loop 171 – 175 ) . Several hydrogen bonds are formed between the peptide and the protein : the side chain of Gln152 makes two hydrogen bonds with the peptide main chain ; one of the carboxyl oxygens of AspP5 makes two hydrogen bonds with the main chain N of Phe27 and Arg320NE ; and the carbonyl of the last vis - ible peptide residue TrpP7 interacts with Lys278NZ and Lys43 from the other molecule in the crystal . In summary , intrapeptide hydrogen bonds hold the peptide , desig - nated the W box , in a short 3 10 - helix , which is also favored by the pro - line at position P3 . This conformation shows shape complementarity with the binding site on the top surface of the TD and allows the two tryptophan residues to be inserted into hydrophobic pockets . This is a ‘two - pin plug in its socket’ binding mode , similar to those found in other interactions of micromolar K d found in vesicle formation 21 – 23 . Functional studies To confirm the nature of the W - box site , we measured binding in solution of various peptides and protein constructs to wild - type and mutant forms of the clathrin TD . In the amphiphysins , the W - box motif occurs in the central unstructured ‘insert’ domain positioned between two folded domains , an N - terminal helical BAR domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain . The insert region contains the two TD - binding sequences , a classic LLDLD clathrin box and the PWDLW W box separated by 21 – 25 residues , as well as several bind - ing sites for the AP - 2 α - subunit appendage 18 – 20 . Two GST fusions based on this domain from amphiphysin 2a were used in pull - down assays with TD constructs , the first , iAmph2a , corresponding to residues 329 – 444 and including both motifs , and the second , iAmph2a ∆ , missing the proximal LLDLD motif ( residues 390 – 397 ) . Both of these constructs , but not GST alone , bind to wild - type TD ( Fig . 3 ) . The association with GST - iAmph2a ∆ shows that the W - box motif alone is sufficient to bind the TD , and , indeed , an amphiphysin 2 – based GST - SIPWDLWEPT fusion protein effectively affinity - purifies clathrin trimers from brain cytosol 20 . To validate the location of the binding site delineated in the struc - ture , three residues that have key interactions with the W - box peptide were mutated . Phe27 , which contacts both TrpP4 and AspP5 , was changed to alanine , serine and tryptophan ; Gln152 , which directly contacts the main chain of LeuP2 and TrpP4 and is close to the side chain of TrpP7 , was altered to leucine ; and Ile154 , which contacts the first TrpP4 , was changed to leucine and tyrosine . Mutation of any of these three residues ( F27W , Q152L and I154Q ) can completely prevent the binding to GST - iAmph2a ∆ ( Fig . 3 ) , although some changes are tolerated . These results validate the second TD - interaction surface as the site of W - box engagement . Notably , in several propeller - contain - ing proteins , the top surface opening to the central aqueous tunnel participates in protein - protein or protein - ligand interactions and even in catalysis 24 . For example , the WD40 β - propeller structure of the heterotrimeric G - protein β subunit uses this flat surface to bind the α subunit 24 , whereas the eight - bladed WD40 β - propeller of Cdc4 uses an analogous surface to bind a phosphopeptide ligand 25 . Binding affinities for three peptides containing the two motifs sepa - rately or together were measured by fluorescence ( see Tables 1 and 2 and Methods ) . The peptides used were the W - box peptide TLP - WDLWTT , the clathrin - box peptide ( FITC ) - APGPFSEQASLLDLD FDPL , and the ‘L + W’ peptide containing both motifs ASLLDLDFD - PLPPVTSPVKAPTPSGQSIPWDLWEPT , which mirrors the insert domain ( binding motifs underlined ) . Binding of the two peptides con - taining the W box was followed by detection of their intrinsic trypto - phan fluorescence , but as the clathrin - box peptide contains no intrinsic fluorophore , it was labeled with fluoroscein to allow binding to be monitored . The emission spectrum of the W - box peptides shows a blue shift on binding , confirming the hydrophobic environment of the tryptophans seen in the crystal structure , and was sufficiently GST TD GST - iAmph2a 50 kDa 37 kDa 25 kDa 20 kDa 75 kDa W T F 27 A F 27 S F 27 W Q 152L I 154 Q I 154 Y S P S P S P S P S P S P S P M M M S P S P W T W T GST - iAmph2a ∆ 390 – 397 GST - iAmph2a GST Figure 3 Amphiphysin - TD interactions .

The W - box peptide binds with a similar affinity ( K d = 28 µ M ) to that of the clathrin - box peptide ( K d = 22 µ M ) , but the L + W - box peptide binds much more strongly . This is because of the presence of two independent binding sequences on the same ligand , which can simultaneously engage their cognate sites ( the ‘chelate effect’ ) . The tight binding made it difficult to estimate accurately the concentra - tion of unbound peptide , so only an upper limit can be put on the K d of ≤ 5 µ M . Association kinetics experiments with the W - box pep - tide gave k on = 4 . 1 × 10 – 3 µ M – 1 s – 1 . From this and the K d , we calcu - lated the off - rate and deduced the half - time of association ( t 1 / 2 ) to be 6 s . These values are consistent with the formation of dynamic com - plexes between clathrin and amphiphysin in the cell and are in line with the relative amounts of clathrin brought down in pull - down experiments with GST - iAmph2a , from rat brain homogenate ( see Fig . 5 ) and with other peptide - protein interactions that occur during transport vesicle formation 12 . Binding constants for the W - box peptide determined in the presence of different TD mutants are consistent with the pull - down results ( Table 1 ) , and the structure explains the effect of each mutation . The F27W substitution fills in the space of TrpP4 and partially that of AspP5 and , in doing so , destabilizes the complex . Mutation of smaller residues in this position ( F27A and F27S ) does not affect the binding . The Q152L change abolishes binding owing to the loss of two hydrogen bonds to the main chain . Ile154 forms part of the hydrophobic cavity for TrpP4 , so mutation to a hydrophilic residue ( I154Q ) abolishes bind - ing , whereas mutation to tyrosine at this position ( I154Y ) does not . DISCUSSION The structure of the clathrin TD in complex with a W - box motif reveals a second interaction surface on the β - propeller distinct from the site between blades 1 and 2 that binds the L Φ X Φ [ DE ] clathrin box 17 ( Fig . 1a , b ) . The two binding sites do not overlap and peptide binding at either site does not require a conformational change in the TD , explain - ing the noncompetitive binding to these two sites . Instead of assuming an extended conformation like the clathrin box , the W - box peptide is compact and helical , and is buried in a solvent - exposed cavity of com - plementary shape on the membrane - proximal ‘top’ surface of TD , ∼ 23 Å away from the clathrin box – binding site ( Fig . 4 ) . Delineation of a second interaction site demonstrates that the W - box sequence is not a degenerate variant of the LLDLD clathrin - box motif 8 . The W box – binding site on TD accommodates the two tryptophan side chains in hydrophobic pockets with the intervening two residues as a spacer ; the spacing optimizes the fit into the binding site . The minimal requirement for a W box is ( P ) WXXW although mutagenesis data indi - cate that a residue capable of forming a charged hydrogen bond would be favored at the first X position 20 . Recently , two sequences in auxilin , NWQ and WDW , have been suggested to bind the TD in a site different from the binding site for a clathrin - box motif 26 . We would not expect either sequence to bind in the PWXXW site described here . The W - box motif was first identified in the amphiphysins , a family of multidomain proteins involved in the late steps of clathrin - coated vesicle scission 18 . In Homo sapiens , two genes encode amphiphysin , one expressed in the brain ( amphiphysin 1 ) 27 , 28 and a second ( amphiphysin 2 ) with a broad tissue distribution and a wide array of alternatively spliced isoforms 29 – 31 . Both have an N - terminal BAR domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain 32 . The BAR domain interacts with membrane phospholipids , inducing curvature and tubula - tion 33 – 36 , whereas the distal SH3 domain associates with proline - based motifs in dynamin and synaptojanin 1 ( refs . 37 , 38 ) . Between these two well - structured domains is a long stretch of amino acids with no pre - dicted secondary structure and in which the major differences between the members of the family reside . This ‘insert’ domain can contain sev - eral short contiguous sequence motifs that bind to the α - appendage of the AP - 2 adaptor and the clathrin and W boxes 19 . In amphiphysin 1 and 2 , the W box is 25 and 21 amino acids downstream of the clathrin box , respectively . The two motifs are sufficiently separated to permit simultaneous binding to both sites on a single TD . Relative to other proteins with only clathrin boxes , this increases the strength of binding of amphiphysin to a single clathrin TD , a phenomenon termed the chelate effect . Thus , amphiphysin may bind preferentially to free TDs at the periphery of the clathrin lattice , whereas other endocytic acces - sory proteins with multiple clathrin box – like motifs could bind prefer - entially to TDs clustered by clathrin lattice formation . These considerations are consistent with a model for clathrin - coat assembly in which adaptors such as AP - 2 , Disabled - 2 , AP180 / CALM and epsin are closely associated with each other via many simultane - ous dynamic interactions underneath the clathrin lattice . Amphi - physin can be recruited to coated pits owing to the interaction with the AP - 2 α - appendage .

In the amphiphysins the two motifs are separated by 21 – 25 residues , a distance amply sufficient to allow the simultaneous binding of the two motifs . The W box – binding site at the ‘top’ of the β - propeller is proximal to membrane surface while the heavy chain leg , seen below , assembles into the polygonal clathrin lattice . © 2004 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t s t r u c t m o l b i o l A R T I C L E S 246 VOLUME 11 NUMBER 3 MARCH 2004 NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY compared with these other clathrin adaptors 36 , and preferential engagement of free TDs , will cause the displacement of amphiphysin to the periphery of the forming clathrin lattice . Here , binding of amphiphysin to the plasma membrane and clathrin could be favored over that of cargo adaptors for several reasons . First , amphiphysin BAR domains bind to tubulated or curved membranes 34 , 36 found at the necks of invaginating vesicles . Second , it is likely that steric clashes reduce the binding of other adaptors to their cargo at the constricted neck . By binding to the amphiphysin SH3 domain , dynamin and synaptojanin will be recruited to , and so concentrated around , the constricted necks of forming vesicles . The resulting high concentra - tion of dynamin will facilitate assembly into multimeric spirals that drive vesicle scission . Database searches for PWXXW sequences in endocytic proteins revealed another potential clathrin partner : SH3PX1 or sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) , a protein that connects endocytosis to signal transduction and receptor regulation 39 – 41 . Very recently , SNX9 has been found to bind to and colocalize with clathrin in vivo in endocytic clathrin coats despite having no recognized clathrin - binding motif 42 . SNX9 contains an N - terminal SH3 domain , an unstructured stretch of ∼ 100 residues containing a putative W - box motif ( PWSAW ) and AP - 2 appendage – binding motifs and , finally , a PX domain and an adjacent helical domain . The helical domain shows distant homology to the amphiphysin BAR domain ( data not shown ) , suggesting that it may dimerize and bind phospholipids weakly 34 – 36 . The location of the PWSAW sequence within an unstructured region of SNX9 prompted us to test if this motif binds to clathrin . Fused to GST , the region including the first 240 amino acids of SNX9 ( corresponding to the SH3 domain and the unstructured linker ) pulls down clathrin from rat brain cytosol , like the insert domain of amphiphysin 2 ( Fig . 5a ) . The GST - SNX9 protein binds to approximately stoichiometric amounts of dynamin 1 , and to synaptojanin 1 via its SH3 domain 42 , but , because these do not bind to clathrin directly ( there is no clathrin present in a GST - amph1 SH3 domain pull down ) , we conclude that SNX9 interacts directly with clathrin . This is validated by the binary association of purified clathrin trimers with the GST - SNX9 fusion protein in interaction assays . The disordered regions of both amphiphysin 2 and SNX9 bind clathrin effi - ciently when fused to GST ( Fig . 5b ) , whereas the clathrin remains soluble in the presence of GST alone . The GST - SNX9 fusion also binds to wild - type TD but not to the TD ( F27W ) mutant in vitro ( data not shown ) , indicating that at least one other endocytic protein con - tains the W - box TD - binding motif . Multivalent binding is important for pro - teins that simultaneously link multiple partners together . The unstructured insert domain of the amphiphysins , with its array of recognition sequences for the TD and α - appendage , is ideally suited to this role and also gives the two well - structured domains that it connects the capacity to explore a large degree of three - dimensional space to find binding partners 43 . Flexibility of function is imparted by the flexibility of unstructured stretches—function arising from disorder . METHODS Plasmids and mutagenesis . Bovine clathrin heavy - chain TD ( residues 1 – 363 ) plasmid was prepared as described 20 , yielding an N - terminally tagged GST - fusion protein . Site - directed mutagenesis was carried out with the QuikChange system ( Stratagene ) to produce the following mutant proteins in GST - TD : F27A , F27S , F27W , Q152L , I154Q and I154Y . Constructs of the human amphiphysin 2 insert domain ( residues 329 – 444 ; iAmph2a ( 329 – 444 ) ) in pGEX - 2TK and the same region lacking the clathrin box ( iAmph2a ∆ , lacking residues 390 – 397 ) were a gift from Peter McPherson . Peptides , proteins and crystallization . The synthesized peptides used were W - box derived from human amphiphysin1 ( TLPWDLWTT ) , fluorescein - labeled clathrin - box derived from human amphiphysin 2a ( FITC - APGPFSE - QASLLDLDFDPL ) and L + W - box derived from human amphiphysin 2a ( ASLLDLDFDPLPPVTSPVKAPTPSGQSIPWDLWEPT ) ( binding motifs underlined ) . GST - fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described 20 , 44 . The TD was cleaved from the GST with bovine thrombin ( Sigma ) overnight at 16 °C . GST was removed by rebinding to glutathione - Sepharose beads and the TDs were finally repurified by gel filtration on Superdex S - 200 . All the mutants were folded , stable and monodisperse , as judged by CD spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering . A complex of wild - type clathrin TD with the amphiphysin - derived peptide was crystallized by hanging - drop vapor diffusion over a reservoir containing 20 % ( w / v ) PEG8000 , 200 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT , 100 mM CAPS , pH 9 . Only one large crystal was grown ; it was transferred into paratone - N oil and flash - cooled at 100 K . The crystal belonged to the space group P 4 1 2 1 2 ( Table 3 ) . The long c - axis was per - pendicular to the spindle , leading to severe overlapping of the spots , and limit - ing data collection to a resolution of 2 . 3 Å . Data were collected at Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source , beamline 9 . 6 , wavelength 0 . 870 Å , and processed with MOSFLM 45 , scaled with SCALA 46 , and the structure was solved by molecular replacement in AMoRe 46 , using as a search model the coordinates deposited by ter Haar and co - workers 17 ( PDB entry 1C9I ) . Model building was done with O 47 after every cycle of refinement , carried out with REFMAC5 ( ref . 48 ) . Molecular figures were produced with Aesop ( M . E . M .

Both GST - iAmph2a and GST - SNX9 bind the purified clathrin efficiently ( lanes 4 and 6 ) whereas GST alone does not ( lane 2 ) . © 2004 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t s t r u c t m o l b i o l A R T I C L E S NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOLUME 11 NUMBER 3 MARCH 2004 247 Fluorimetric assays . Binding of peptides to TD was measured by titrating each protein with the peptides ( between 3 and 5 µ M TD , 250 µ M peptide , both in 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 20 °C ) by measuring the peptide fluorescence . For the intrinsic fluorescence of the W - box peptides , excitation was at 295 nm , and an average of six spectra were collected for each point over a 300 – 450 nm wave - length range . The spectra were corrected for dilution ( never exceeding 5 % ) . The spectra of wild - type TD and of the W - box peptide alone are sufficiently different both in shape and in wavelength of emission maximum ( 335 nm for TD alone , 356 nm for peptide alone ) . On peptide binding , the emission of the protein decreases and the maximum shifts toward the blue ( 331 nm ) , and an isosbestic point appears at 365 nm . Fluorescence emission at 331 nm was used to calculate the ratio of bound to free peptide 49 , and the resulting Scatchard plot was analyzed with Grafit 5 . 0 ( http : / / www . erithacus . com ) . In the case of titration with fluorescein - labeled clathrin - box peptide , the excitation wave - length was 480 nm and emission was measured at 540 nm . Protein binding assays . GST - iAmph2a or GST - iAmph2a ∆ bound to glu - tathione - Sepharose beads were incubated with an approximately stoichiomet - ric amount of purified , thrombin - cleaved TD for 4 h at 16 °C . An aliquot of the unbound material was taken and then the beads washed twice with 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 200 mM NaCl . Bound and unbound samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , followed by staining with Coomassie blue . Pull - down assays with rat brain cytosol were done as described 20 using 100 µ g of GST , GST - iAmph2a ( 329 – 444 ) , GST - SNX9 ( 1 – 240 ) or GST - amph 1 SH3 domain ( rat residues 596 – 683 ) immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose . Bound fusion proteins were incubated with rat brain cytosol at 4 °C for 1 – 2 h . After centrifugation , aliquots of each supernatant and washed pellet were resolved by SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - clathrin heavy - chain ( HC ) TD . 1 , anti - AP - 2 µ 2 - subunit serum , monoclonal anti - dynamin ( BD Transduction Laboratories ) or anti - synaptojainin 1 . Bound antibodies were detected with HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL ( Fig . 5a ) . Pull - down assays with purified clathrin were done similarly . GST - fusion protein ( 10 µ g ) was incubated with 20 µ g ml – 1 clathrin in the presence of 100 µ g ml – 1 BSA as a carrier . Aliquots of each supernatant and washed pellet were resolved by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue ( Fig . 5b ) . Clathrin was prepared from rat brain clathrin - coated vesicles by gel filtration chromatography followed by buffer exchange into assay buffer 50 . Coordinates .
