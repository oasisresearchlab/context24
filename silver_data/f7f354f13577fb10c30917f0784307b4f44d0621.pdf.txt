Intriguingly , CAP has been isolated from different cells and tissues as an equimolar complex with actin , and previous studies have shown that a CAP - actin complex contains six molecules each of CAP and actin . Here , we successfully isolated a complex of Xenopus cyclase - associated protein 1 ( XCAP1 ) and actin from oocyte extracts and demonstrated that the complex contained four molecules each of XCAP1 and actin . The XCAP1 - actin complex remained stable as a single population of 340 kDa in hydrodynamic analysis using gel filtration or analytical ultracentrifugation . Examination of the XCAP1 - actin complex by high - speed atomic force microscopy revealed a tripartite structure : a middle globular domain and two globular arms . The two arms were connected with the middle globular domain by a flexible linker and observed in two states with different heights , presumably representing the presence or absence of G - actin . We hypothesize that the middle globular domain corresponds to a tetramer of the N - terminal helical - folded domain of XCAP1 , and that each arm in the high state corresponds to a hetero - tetramer containing a dimer of the C - terminal CARP domain of XCAP1 and two G - actin molecules . This novel configuration of a CAP - actin complex may represent a functionally important aspect of this complex . Introduction Regulated assembly and disassembly of actin filaments are vital to the diverse function of the actin cytoskeleton ( 1 ) . Cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) is one of the actin - regulatory proteins that control multiple key aspects of actin filament dynamics ( 2 , 3 ) . CAP was originally identified in yeast as a protein that binds to adenylyl cyclase and is involved in the Ras signaling pathway ( 4 , 5 ) . However , CAP was later recognized as an actin - binding protein in a variety of eukaryotes . CAP binds to actin monomers and inhibits polymerization ( 6 ) . CAP also promotes exchange of actin - bound nucleotides in competition with cofilin and increases ATP - bound actin monomers that are readily available for polymerization ( 7 - 9 ) . In addition , CAP and cofilin interact with actin filaments to enhance severing ( 10 , 11 ) and monomer dissociation from the pointed ends ( 12 , 13 ) . A combination of CAP and twinfilin also enhances actin monomer dissociation from filament ends ( 14 ) . CAP is involved in a number of cellular events that require actin remodeling in various cell types and tissues . For example , CAP is essential for muscle sarcomere organization in Caenorhabditis elegans ( 15 ) and mice ( 16 ) , and deficiency of CAP2 , a mammalian CAP isoform , causes cardiomyopathy in mice ( 17 , 18 ) and humans ( 19 ) . Intriguingly , when non - recombinant native CAP is isolated from tissues or cells , actin is associated with CAP in a multimeric complex at an equimolar ratio and cannot be dissociated without harsh conditions . Porcine CAP ( originally reported as ASP - 56 ) was isolated from platelets as a complex with actin , and actin was finally dissociated from CAP by 3M urea ( 20 ) . Similar CAP - actin complex has been isolated from yeast ( 8 ) , bovine thymus ( 11 ) , and mouse brain ( 21 ) . The CAP - actin complex promotes actin filament disassembly in the presence of cofilin ( 8 , 11 ) . In addition , recent studies have shown that the CAP - actin complex containing acetylated actin is an inhibitor of inverted formin 2 ( INF2 ) ( 21 , 22 ) . Thus , the 3 CAP and actin have biological functions as a complex , but how the complex is assembled and why the complex formation is important for its functions remain unknown . The native complex of yeast CAP ( also known as Srv2 ) and actin is a 6 : 6 complex of ~ 600 kDa ( 8 ) , which can be reconstituted from purified components ( 23 ) . The CAP - actin complex from mouse brain is also in a similar size ( 21 ) . The N - terminal half of yeast and mouse CAPs form a hexameric “ shuriken ” structure , which is mediated by oligomerization of a putative coiled - coil region at the most N - terminus ( 10 , 24 ) and dimerization of the helical - folded domain ( HFD ) ( 12 , 25 , 26 ) . The C - terminal half of CAP contains a CAP and X - linked retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein ( CARP ) domain that dimerizes through the most C - terminal dimerization motif ( 27 , 28 ) . The CARP domain of CAP binds to actin monomer ( 6 , 29 - 31 ) , and a CARP dimer and two actin molecules form a compact globular structure ( 32 ) . Although we know structures of parts of the CAP - actin complex , we still have limited knowledge on the structure of the entire complex . Furthermore , a recent study has demonstrated that the N - terminal regions of human CAP1 and CAP2 primarily form tetramers instead of hexamers ( 33 ) . Therefore , whether the 6 : 6 configuration is conserved among CAP - actin complexes from different sources remains unknown . In this study , we purified a complex of Xenopus CAP1 and actin and demonstrated that the complex contained the two proteins in a 4 : 4 stoichiometric ratio , which is a novel configuration of the CAP - actin complex . Results Xenopus CAP1 ( XCAP1 ) and actin form a 4 : 4 complex We purified a native complex of CAP and actin from Xenopus oocyte extracts ( Fig . 1 ) . When Xenopus oocyte extracts were applied to a column in which glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - fused Xenopus ADF / cofilin ( XAC ) was immobilized , several proteins specifically bound to the column as described previously ( 34 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . We reported that the 65 - kDa , 42 - kDa , and 19 - kDa proteins were Xenopus actin - interacting protein 1 ( XAIP1 ) , actin , and XAC , respectively ( 34 ) . Peptide sequencing identified that the 94 - kDa and 60 - kDa proteins were gelsolin ( 35 ) and cyclase - associated protein 1 ( XCAP1 ) ( 36 ) , respectively . We attempted to isolate XCAP1 using anion - exchange chromatography followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography , but XCAP1 and actin were not separated during these procedures , and were instead purified together in an equimolar ratio ( Fig . 1B ) . Further gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G - 200 also resulted in co - elution of XCAP1 and actin in a single peak at ~ 390 kDa ( our unpublished observation ) , which is much larger than XCAP1 or actin alone , or a 1 : 1 complex , indicating that they form a stable multimeric complex . Native molecular mass of the XCAP1 - actin complex was determined more accurately by two different methods : size - exclusion chromatography coupled with multi - angle light scattering ( SEC - MALS ) and analytical ultracentrifugation . In SEC - MALS , the XCAP1 - actin complex was resolved as a single peak with a molecular mass of 340 kDa ( Fig . 1C ) . There were no detectable peaks that corresponded to dissociated XCAP1 or actin , indicating that the XCAP1 - actin complex was stable during the SEC - MALS analysis . Likewise , in analytical ultracentrifugation , the XCAP1 - actin complex was resolved as a single peak of 337 kDa ( S = 10 ) ( Fig . 1D ) , which agrees with the result of SEC - MALS . Considering 4 the molecular masses of individual XCAP1 ( 52 kDa ) and actin ( 42 kDa ) , the native molecular mass of the XCAP1 - actin complex most closely matched with that of a 4 : 4 complex ( calculated molecular mass of 376 kDa ) . Since CAPs are known to bind to actin monomers , the XCAP1 - actin complex most likely contains G - actin . Therefore , these results indicate that the native XCAP1 and G - actin form a stable complex at a 4 : 4 stoichiometric ratio . XCAP1 - actin complex has a tripartite structure as revealed by high - speed atomic force microscopy Structure of the XCAP1 - actin complex in its native state was examined by high - speed atomic force microscopy ( Fig . 2 and 3 ) . Typical images on mica surfaces showed that the complex consisted of three globular domains ( Fig . 2A ) , which we designated as the middle globular domain ( MGD , shown in red in Fig . 2A cartoons ) and two arms ( Arm 1 and Arm 2 , shown in green or blue in Fig . 2A cartoons ) . The height of MGD was 3 . 6 ± 0 . 9 nm ( n = 107 ) ( Fig . 2B , C ) and remained relatively stable during time - lapse imaging ( Fig . 2A and G , Supplementary Movie S1 ) . By contrast , the two arms were observed in two different states : a high state ( Arm - HS , shown in blue in Fig . 2A cartoons ) and a low state ( Arm - LS , shown in green in Fig . 2A cartoons , also see Fig . 3 ) . The height of Arm - HS was 7 . 5 ± 0 . 5 nm ( n = 855 ) ( Fig . 2D and E ) , while that of Arm - LS was 3 . 3 ± 0 . 3 nm ( n = 1078 ) ( Fig . 2F and Fig . 3C and D ) . In some cases , the arms transitioned either from Arm - LS to Arm - HS ( Fig . 2A and G , blue line at ~ 0 . 9 s ) or from Arm - HS to Arm - LS ( Fig . 2A and G , green line at 4 . 5 s ) , suggesting that association or dissociation of a component , presumably G - actin , occurred during observations . Over the periods of HS - AFM observations , Arm - HS gradually decreased , while Arm - LS predominated , suggesting that Arm - HS was converted to Arm - LS by dissociation of actin over time likely due to repeated tapping by the AFM probe and adsorption of the complex on the surface ( see below ) . Some of the complexes had Arm - LS throughout the observations ( Fig . 2A , indicated by dashed line , Fig . 3A , Supplementary Movie S2 ) , and the height of Arm - LS was 3 . 3 ± 0 . 3 nm ( n = 1078 ) ( Fig . 3B - D ) . The two arms were very dynamic when they were in Arm - HS ( Fig . 2A . Supplementary Movie S1 ) , but restricted within 14 . 8 ± 4 . 9 nm ( n = 214 ) of MGD ( Fig . 2H and I ) as if the arms were connected to MGD by flexible linkers . The distance between the highest points of the two arms in Arm - HS fluctuated in a wide range with an average of 17 . 4 ± 7 . 6 nm ( n = 427 ) ( Fig . 2H and J ) , further supporting the presence of flexible linkers between MGD and each arm . However , once arms were converted from Arm - HS to Arm - LS , they were stabilized in Arm - LS ( Fig . 3A - D , Supplementary Movie S2 ) , while MGD remained unchanged ( Fig . 3B , E , and F ) . The distance between two arms became wider [ 22 . 9 ± 5 . 7 nm ( n = 539 ) ] , whereas that between each arm and MGD became narrower [ 13 . 0 ± 3 . 7 nm ( n = 1078 ) ] . These results suggest that Arm - LS was physically stabilized by adsorption to the mica surface . To test how surface adsorption affects the molecular features of the XCAP1 - actin complex , we used a mica surface that was treated with APTES , which adds positive charges to the surface and causes non - specific strong adsorption of proteins . On APTES - treated mica , the two arms were almost always detected in the low state ( Arm - LS ) with the height of 3 . 0 ± 0 . 4 nm ( n = 2293 ) ( Fig . 4A - D , Supplementary Movie S3 ) . The height and shape of MGD were indistinguishable between normal and APTES - treated mica surfaces ( Fig . 4A , B , E , 5 and F ) . The distance between the two arms remained relatively constant at 25 . 4 ± 5 . 6 nm ( n = 1331 ) ( Fig . 4G and H ) , which is much wider than that of two arms in Arm - HS on normal mica surfaces ( Fig . 2I ) , suggesting that the two arms were strongly immobilized on the surface and spread apart . By contrast , the distance between MGD and an arm remained constant on the APTES - treated surface ( Fig . 4G and I ) in a similar manner to MGD and Arm - LS on the normal surface ( Fig . 3I ) . These observations suggest that strong adsorption of the XCAP1 - actin complex onto a solid surface artificially converts Arm - HS to Arm - LS by causing dissociation of an arm - bound component , which we hypothesize to be G - actin . Discussion Based on known biochemical and biophysical properties of CAP from other species , we propose a model for the structure of the XCAP1 - actin complex , which is in the appearance of two “butterflies” ( CARP / G - actin ) and a “flower” ( HFD ) ( Fig . 5 ) . We hypothesize that MGD corresponds to a tetramer of the HFD of XCAP1 , and that each arm domain in the high state ( Arm - HS ) corresponds to a hetero - tetramer containing a dimer of the CARP domain of XCAP1 and two G - actin molecules ( Fig . 5 ) . The HFD of CAP by itself forms a dimer ( 12 , 25 , 26 ) , and the N - terminal oligomerization motif forms a putative coiled - coil and mediates formation of a tetramer ( 33 ) or hexamer ( 10 , 23 , 24 ) of the HFD . The height of MGD ( Fig . 2C , 3F , 4F ) matches with that of the diameter of one HFD ( 12 , 25 ) , suggesting that each HFD is laterally attached to the substrate . By contrast , the C - terminal dimerization motif mediates rigid dimerization of the CARP domain through strand - exchange  - sheet formation ( 27 ) , which then binds to two G - actin molecules ( 32 ) . Again , the height of Arm - HS ( Fig . 2E ) matches with the diameter of the hetero - tetramer of CARP and G - actin ( 32 ) . Proline - rich regions and Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome protein - homology 2 ( WH2 ) can serve as a flexible linker between HFD and CARP ( Fig . 5 ) . WH2 of CAP binds to G - actin ( 31 , 37 ) , but transient dissociation of WH2 from G - actin can allow full extension of the linker with structural flexibility . WH2 of CAP also binds to the N - terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain of INF2 ( 22 ) . Therefore , flexibility of WH2 in the CAP - actin complex should keep it accessible with INF2 . This hypothetical architecture of the XCAP1 - actin complex needs to be tested by additional structural analysis at higher resolutions or localization of components using specific probes . The configuration of the XCAP1 - actin complex in a 4 : 4 stoichiometric ratio is different from other reported configurations of CAP - actin complexes from different organisms in a 6 : 6 molar ratio ( 8 , 23 ) . It is worth noting that the tripartite structure of the XCAP1 - actin complex is very similar to one of the electron microscopy images of yeast Srv2 / CAP - actin complex ( see Fig . 1 of Ref . ( 8 ) ) . However , the yeast Srv2 / CAP - actin complex is a 600 - kDa complex containing Srv2 / CAP and actin in a molar ratio of 6 : 6 ( 8 ) . It remains unclear whether such a difference represents an inherent structural variety of the complex assembly or technical artifacts in the analyses or preparation methods . Further studies are needed to test whether the XCAP1 - actin complex with a similar configuration can be reconstituted from purified XCAP1 and G - actin , which should allow dissection of domains and residues that are required for assembly of the XCAP1 - actin complex . Our structural model of the CAP - actin complex places the actin - binding site of HFD outward , suggesting that any two of 6 the four HFDs can interact with two actin subunits at the pointed end of a filament to accelerate depolymerization ( 12 , 13 ) . It allows two remaining free HFD to interact with newly exposed actin subunits at the pointed end , such that CAP can stay bound to a filament and processively depolymerize actin filaments from the pointed end . However , whether CAP can depolymerize actin filaments processively remains to be determined . In addition , the CARP domain , which has nucleotide exchange activity , is in proximity and available to capture newly depolymerized ADP - actin and promote rapid conversion to ATP - actin . It would be interesting to determine whether binding of other proteins to WH2 or proline - rich region in the flexible linker ( 22 , 38 - 40 ) or phosphorylation of CAP ( 41 , 42 ) alters the structure and function of the CAP - actin complex . Thus , our structural model provides mechanistic insight in the function of CAP in the regulation of actin turnover . Experimental procedures Purification of XCAP1 - actin complex from Xenopus laevis oocytes Extracts from Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared and applied to an affinity column in which GST - fused Xenopus ADF / cofilin ( XAC ) had been immobilized as described ( 34 ) . Proteins bound to the column were eluted with 1 M NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , and 20 mM HEPES - KOH , pH 7 . 2 . The eluate was fractionated with ammonium sulfate at 45 % saturation . The precipitates obtained by centrifugation was dissolved and dialyzed against 60 mM NaCl buffer ( 60 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) , applied to a DE52 column pre - equilibrated with the same buffer , and then eluted with a linear gradient of 60 - 300 mM NaCl . The fractions containing XCAP1 - actin complex was directly applied to a hydroxyapatite column pre - equilibrated with 60 mM NaCl buffer and washed thoroughly with the same buffer . XCAP1 - actin complex was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 - 300 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 8 . 0 . Purified XCAP1 - actin complex was concentrated by ultrafiltration with Ultracel - 30K ( Millipore ) and dialyzed against 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , and 20 mM HEPES - KOH , pH 7 . 2 . Size exclusion chromatography - multi - angle light scattering Samples were analyzed by a Malvern OmniSEC integrated system ( Malvern Pananalytical , MA ) with a SRT SEC - 300 ( Sepax , Newark , DE ) analytical SEC column . Samples were loaded from an autoinjector sample tray that was kept at 20 °C . Phosphate - buffered saline ( pH 7 . 2 ) containing 0 . 02 % NaN 3 was used in a mobile phase . Calibration was done using a bovine serum albumin standard . Data from a refractive index , right angle light scattering ( RALS ) , low angle light scattering ( LALS ) , viscosimeter and a UV PDA detector were collected . The resulting chromatograms were analyzed using triple detection ( RI , RALS and viscosimeter ) and the dn / dc from sample concentration were used to calculate molecular weight of the peaks as well as hydrodynamic radius . Molecular weights were calculated with Malvern OmniSEC software version 10 . 41 . Analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation velocity data were collected using a Beckman Optima AUC analytical ultracentrifuge using a rotor speed of 40 , 000 rpm ( 128794 g ) at 20 °C . Data were recorded by monitoring the 7 sedimentation of the absorbance at 280 nm using a radial step size of 0 . 001 cm . Set parameters included a partial specific volume ( Vbar ) of 0 . 73 , a buffer viscosity of 1 . 002 Poise , and density of 1 . 00 g / ml . Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed using both SEDFIT ( www . analyticalultracentrifugation . com ) ( 43 ) and UltraScan ( www . ultrascan . uthscsa . edu ) ( 44 ) . Continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution c ( s ) analyses were restrained by maximum entropy regularization at P = 0 . 95 confidence interval . The baseline , meniscus , frictional coefficient , systematic time - invariant and radial invariant noise were fit . High - speed atomic force microscopy HS - AFM imaging was performed in solution at room temperature using a laboratory - built HS - AFM setup ( 45 , 46 ) , as described previously ( 47 ) . In brief , a glass sample stage ( diameter , 2 mm ; height , 2 mm ) with a thin mica disc ( 1 . 5 mm in diameter and ~ 0 . 05 mm in thickness ) glued to the top by epoxy was attached onto the top of a Z - scanner by a drop of nail polish . Either bare mica surface or APTES ( ( 3 - aminopropyl ) triethoxysilane ) treated mica surface ( 48 ) was used as a substrate . Onto either substrate , a drop ( 2 μl ) of diluted protein sample ( ca . 1 nM ) with buffer A ( 100 mM KCl , 20 mM HEPES – KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) was deposited for 3 min . For the observation using bare mica surface , the surface was rinsed with 20 μl of buffer B ( 30 mM KCl , 20 mM HEPES – NaOH , pH 7 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) and imaged in buffer B . For the observation using APTES treated mica surface , the surface was rinsed with 20 μl of buffer A and imaged in buffer A . AFM imaging was carried out in a tapping mode using small cantilevers ( BLAC10DS - A2 , Olympus ) ( resonant frequency , ~ 0 . 5 MHz in water ; quality factor , ~ 1 . 5 in water ; spring constant , ~ 0 . 1 N m −1 ) . The probe tip was grown on the original tip end of a cantilever through electron beam deposition using ferrocene and was further sharpened using a radio frequency plasma etcher ( Tergeo , PIE Scientific LLC . , USA ) under an argon gas atmosphere ( Direct mode , 10 sccm and 20 W for 1 . 5 min ) . The cantilever’s free oscillation amplitude A 0 and set - point amplitude A s were set at ~ 2 nm and ~ 0 . 9 × A 0 , respectively . The imaging rate , scan size , and pixel size for each AFM image are described in the figure legends . Data analyses of HS - AFM images HS - AFM images were viewed and analyzed using the laboratory built software , Kodec4 . 4 . 7 . 39 ( 49 ) . In brief , a low - pass filter to remove spike noise and a flattening filter to make the xy - plane flat were applied to individual images . The position and height of the peak within each domain were determined semi - automatically using the following steps . First , the most probable highest point was selected manually . Second , the actual highest point was automatically determined by searching a 5 × 5 pixel area ( typically 6 . 25 × 6 . 25 nm 2 ) around the selected point .
