THOMAS PARSONSt Department of Microbiology and Cancer Center , University of Virginia Health Sciences Center , Charlottesville , VA 22908 Communicated by Raymond L . Erikson , February 15 , 1990 ( received for review December 15 , 1989 ) ABSTRACT Cellular transformation by oncogenic retro - viruses encoding protein tyrosine kinases coincides with the tyrosine - specific phosphorylation of multiple protein sub - strates . Previous studies have shown that tyrosine phosphor - ylation of a protein of 120 kDa , p120 , correlated with src transformation in chicken embryo fibroblasts . Additionally , we previously identified two phosphotyrosine - containing cel - lular proteins , p130 and p110 , that formed stable complexes with activated variants of pp605 ) C , the src - encoded tyrosine kinase . To study transformation - relevant tyrosine kinase sub - strates , we have generated monoclonal antibodies to individual tyrosine phosphoproteins , including p130 , p120 , p110 , and five additional phosphoproteins ( p210 , p125 , p118 , p85 , and p185 / p64 ) . These antibodies detected several of the same tyrosine phosphoproteins in chicken embryo fibroblasts trans - formed by avian retroviruses Y73 and CT10 , encoding the yes and crk oncogenes , respectively . Protein substrates in mouse , rat , hamster , and human cells overexpressing activated vari - ants of chicken pp6rc were also detected by several of the monoclonal antibodies . The role of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins by oncogene - encoded tyrosine kinases during transformation is largely unclear . Multiple protein substrates are phosphoryl - ated on tyrosine in response to various cell stimuli , including growth factor activation ( 1 - 5 ) , agonist stimulation of secre - tion ( 6 ) , platelet activation ( 7 - 9 ) , cell cycle changes ( 10 , 11 ) , and cell transformation induced by oncogene - encoded tyro - sine kinases ( 12 - 21 ) . Although the majority of these cellular protein substrates have not been identified , recent studies have demonstrated the interactions of known tyrosine phos - phoproteins thought to be involved in signal - transduction pathways ( 22 ) . Direct identification ofthe individual proteins may provide information regarding their activities during cell growth processes and perhaps lead to an understanding of the relevance of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in vivo . The study of tyrosine - phosphorylated cellular proteins has recently relied on antibodies to phosphotyrosine ( anti - P - Tyr ) ( 13 , 15 , 16 , 23 , 24 ) . Immunoblot analysis of cell proteins with anti - P - Tyr has revealed previously undetected P - Tyr - containing proteins in both normal and transformed cells . Specifically , expression of the oncogene - encoded tyrosine kinase pp60src of Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of 15 - 20 different cellular sub - strates in several cell systems ( 13 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 ) . We and others have demonstrated that one phosphoprotein of 120 kDa , p120 , may be relevant to transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts ( CEFs ) by activated pp60src ( 17 , 20 ) . A mutation of the normal c - src gene that changes the C - terminal tyrosine residue ( Tyr - 527 ) to phenylalanine was sufficient to induce both cell transformation ( 25 - 29 ) and tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 ( 17 , 20 ) . However , an additional mutation at the N - terminal glycine residue at position 2 ( the site of myristoylation for membrane associa - tion ) in the activated src protein ( pp * S27F pp602A / 527F ablated both p120 phosphorylation and transforming activity ( 17 , 20 ) . Moreover , two additional tyrosine phosphoproteins of 130 and 110 kDa were observed in immunocomplexes of activated pp60src proteins by anti - P - Tyr immunoblotting ( 12 ) . Analysis of the pl3o / pllO / pp60s complex has shown that two parameters are required for stable protein interaction : ( i ) activation ofthe tyrosine kinase activity of pp60 ' 1 in vivo and ( ii ) an intact src homology domain ( 30 ) in pp60S1 , an N - terminal region with sequence similarity to the crk oncogene product , the ras GTPase - activating protein , a - spectrin , and phospholipase C - y ( 31 , 32 ) . These studies indicate that tyro - sine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins may be important during cellular transformation by pp60s1 . To study individual tyrosine phosphoprotein substrates , we have generated monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) to p130 , p120 , and p110 , and five other proteins that are tyrosine - phosphorylated in CEFs expressing activated variants of pp601S1 . We present the derivation and characterization of these mAbs with respect to their use in the study of poten - tially relevant substrates of several tyrosine kinases in dif - ferent cell systems . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells , Viruses , and Plasmids . Primary CEFs were prepared from gs - negative embryos ( SPAFAS , Norwich , CT ) ( 20 ) . pRL - 527F and pRL - 2A / 527F , plasmids bearing chicken c - src gene mutants in a nonpermuted RSV clone , were constructed and transfected as described ( 20 ) . NIH 3T3 ( mouse fibroblast line ) , Rat - 1 ( rat fibroblast line ) , HOS ( human osteosarcoma cell line ) , lOW ( asbestos - transformed Syrian hamster embryo cell line ; ref . 33 ) , and their v - src - transformed cognate cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s me - dium with 10 % o fetal bovine serum . Immunoprecipitations and Immu nit Chromatogra - phy . Immunoprecipitations and immunoaffinity purification of tyrosine phosphoproteins from CEFs with affinity - purified rabbit anti - P - Tyr were performed as described ( 34 ) . Immunizations and Fusion Protocol . Immunoaffinity - purified tyrosine phosphoproteins derived from CEFs ex - pressing pp60527F or pp632A / 527F ( 5 log each ) were combined and emulsified in 350 gl of 50 % complete Freund ' s adjuvant and injected both subcutaneously and intraperitoneally into individual female A / J strain mice ( The Jackson Laboratory ) for the initial immunization .

After an additional month , 30 Ag of mixed antigen in phosphate - buffered saline was injected intraperitoneally either 4 days prior to fusion or 8 , 6 , and 4 days ( 10 , ug / day ) prior to fusion . The spleen cells were fused with the SP2 / 0 myeloma cell line as described ( 35 , 36 ) . The cell fusions were dispersed into five to eight 96 - well plates ( containing 100 % of the cells ) , screened for growth 1 - 7 days after plating , and then screened for mAb production by ELISA starting on day 8 . ELISA / immunoprecipitation - positive hybridomas were subcloned twice by limiting dilu - tion , ascites were generated in CAF / 1J mice , and mAbs were purified by protein A - Sepharose affinity chromatography . ELISA . The direct ELISA was performed by coating Immulon II ( Dynatech ) 96 - well plates with 100 ng of mixed purified tyrosine phosphoproteins per well for 16 hr at 40C . After the plates were washed with TBS / V ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 3 / 150 mM NaCl / 10 AM sodium orthovanadate ) and blocked with 0 . 05 % Tween 20 in TBS / V , hybridoma culture supernatants ( 100 Al ) were incubated for 3 hr at 40C followed by addition of horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated second antibody for 3 hr . Color reactions were developed with o - phenylenediamine as substrate ( 37 ) . For the indirect assay , plates were coated with 100 , ul of rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) at 4 , g / ml and incubated for 16 hr at 4°C . Culture supernatants were added as described above , followed by 100 j # d ofmixed cell lysate ( - 300 , ug ) from CEFs expressing pp6O57 or pp602A / 527 . Biotinylated , affinity - purified rabbit anti - P - Tyr ( 1 : 2000 dilution ) were added and incubated for 3 hr at 4°C . Avidin - conjugated HRP was then added and color reactions were developed as described above . Determination of positive hybridoma cultures was based on signals > 0 . 3 A492 unit above background . Immunoblotting . Immunoprecipitated proteins were sub - jected to SDS / 8 % PAGE ( 38 ) and transferred to nitrocellu - lose ( BA - 83 , Schleicher & Schuell ) . After incubation in 4 % bovine serum albumin in TN buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 / 150 mM NaCl ) at 37°C for 4 hr , the filters were probed with affinity - purified rabbit anti - P - Tyr as described ( 12 , 13 , 16 , 20 , 34 ) . For immunoblotting assays with mAbs , the albumin / TN blocking solution was supplemented with 5 % nonfat dry milk ( 33 ) , and the filters were incubated with mAb at 2 , g / ml for 16 hr at 4°C , then incubated with 1251I - labeled sheep anti - mouse IgG ( Amersham ) at 1 , uCi / ml ( 1 , uCi = 37 kBq ) , washed , and exposed to Kodak X - RP film at - 70°C with intensifying screens . RESULTS Generation and Isolation of mAbs to Individual Protein Substrates of pp60 . We previously reported the purification of tyrosine - phosphorylated cellular proteins by immunoaf - A B rabbit anti - mouse - HRP JRw pTyr protein unknown Mab finity chromatography with anti - P - Tyr ( 34 ) . This procedure was used to prepare tyrosine phosphoproteins from CEFs infected with variants of RSV ( 527F and 2A / 527F ) encoding activated forms of the c - src protooncogene protein , pp60cs ' ( 20 ) . RSV - 527F contains a mutation in the src gene altering the C - terminal Tyr - 527 to phenylalanine . This mutation ac - tivates both the tyrosine kinase and the transforming activity of pp6src ( 25 - 29 ) . RSV - 2A / 527F contains an additional mutation altering the N - terminal glycine residue at position 2 to alanine . A mutation at this site in pp60src blocks myris - toylation and prevents association with cellular membranes ( 17 , 19 , 20 ) . The expression of these activated variants of pp6SrC induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of 15 - 20 cellu - lar proteins ( 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 ) , many of which have been purified 3000 - fold with anti - P - Tyr immunoaffinity resins ( 34 ) . Since the expression of these two c - src variants results in both common and different tyrosine phosphorylations , antigens purified from each cell type were combined and used in the immunization procedures . Four A / J strain mice were immunized with mixed P - Tyr - containing antigens by both subcutaneous and intraperi - toneal injection . To assess the immunogenicity of the various phosphoproteins , the mice were bled 10 days after immuni - zation , and the sera were assayed for antibodies to tyrosine phosphoproteins by immunoprecipitation and anti - P - Tyr immunoblotting . Immune responses to several proteins were detected in two different mice , and increased titers to indi - vidual proteins were observed upon successive injections with antigen ( data not shown ) . To identify mAbs to tyrosine phosphoproteins and to distinguish mAbs to non - tyrosine - phosphorylated contami - nating proteins in the immunoaffinity - purified antigen mix - tures , two different ELISAs were developed . The direct ELISA ( Fig . 1A ) relied on the use of the immunoaffinity - purified P - Tyr - containing protein mixture as the source of antigen . The mAb , bound to its respective antigen , was detected by a rabbit anti - mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to HRP , followed by development of a color reaction . This assay detected mAbs to highly abundant P - Tyr - containing antigens and to copurified non - tyrosine - phosphorylated pro - teins in the mixture . The indirect ELISA ( Fig . 1B ) relied on cell lysates from CEFs expressing pp60527F and pp602A / 527F as the source of tyrosine - phosphorylated antigen . In this assay , the mAb contained in individual hybridoma supernatants was captured by an unlabeled rabbit anti - mouse immunoglobulin . Cell lysates were then incubated to allow binding of antigen to the mAb . After washing , biotinylated affinity - purified rabbit anti - P - Tyr was added . This step required that the mAb - bound antigen contained an immunoreactive P - Tyr residue that was displaced from the mAb - binding epitope . avidin - HRP biotin labeled anti - pTyr FIG . 1 .

( A ) The direct assay was performed with immunoaffinity - pTyr protein purified tyrosine phosphoproteins as an - tigen . mAbs were detected with HRP - unknown Mab conjugated rabbit antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin . ( B ) In the indirect as - say the source of antigen was cell lysates from CEFs expressing activated src var - iants . Detection of mAbs was performed rabbit anti - mouse with biotinylated - rabbit anti - P - Tyr bind - ing to the same antigen as mAb , followed by reaction with avidin - conjugated HRP . i Biochemistry : Kanner et al . L - . . . . ) p A p p - q " Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 87 ( 1990 ) The positive signal was then detected by avidin - HRP conju - gates and a color reaction . The indirect assay was specific for antigens that contained a P - Tyr residue , and was more sensitive than the direct ELISA in detecting mAbs to minor antigens . Spleen cells from two mice with serum titers to several antigens were fused with SP2 / 0 myeloma cells ( 35 , 36 ) , and the resulting clones were screened by both the direct and the indirect ELISA . In fusion I , 426 hybridomas resulted from the plating of fused cells into 768 wells ( 55 % ) . ELISA - positive clones were detected in 80 / 426 wells ( 19 % ) , 16 of which were positive by subsequent immunoprecipitation / immunoblotting assays . In fusion II , of 360 hybridomas that grew in 480 wells plated ( 75 % ) , 171 were positive by ELISA ( 47 % ) , yielding 16 mAbs positive by immunoprecipitation / immunoblotting assays ( see Table 1 for details ) . mAbs di - rected to p210 , p130 , p85 , p185 / p64 , and P - Tyr were readily detected by both direct and indirect ELISAs , while mAbs to p125 , p120 , p118 , and p110 were detected only in the indirect ELISA . Characterization of Individual mAbs . mAbs to eight differ - ent tyrosine phosphoproteins , and mAbs directed to P - Tyr , were identified and subcloned by limiting dilution . Fig . 2 shows the eight proteins immunoprecipitated by their respec - tive mAbs and detected by anti - P - Tyr immunoblotting . The proteins were designated by their mobility in SDS / polyacryl - amide gels as follows : p210 ( lane 1 ) , p130 ( lane 2 ) , p125 ( lane 3 ) , p120 ( lane 4 ) , p118 ( lane 5 ) , p110 ( lane 6 ) , p85 ( lane 7 ) , and p185 / p64 ( lane 8 ) . For comparison , activated pp6Osrc was immunoprecipitated ( lane 9 ) with the previously generated mAb EC10 ( 39 ) , showing the coimmunoprecipitation of p130 and p110 ( 12 ) . Immunoprecipitation of the entire panel of proteins was achieved with a mAb generated to P - Tyr ( lane 10 ) .

Immuno - precipitated proteins were detected by anti - P - Tyr immunoblotting . mAbs used for immunoprecipitation were 3C4 ( lane 1 ) , 3D1 ( lane 2 ) , 2A7 ( lane 3 ) , 2B12 ( lane 4 ) , 1E12 ( lane 5 ) , 4C3 ( lane 6 ) , 3B12 ( lane 7 ) , 4H6 ( lane 8 ) , EC10 ( lane 9 ) , and 6G9 ( lane 10 ) . The bands at 50 kDa and - 25 kDa are IgG heavy and light chains , respectively . a , Anti . protein species , three of the mAbs appeared to have complex specificities . mAb to p130 immunoprecipitated two addi - tional unidentified proteins that were not detected by direct immunoblotting ( data not shown ) . In addition , mAbs to p85 immunoprecipitated a triplet of proteins . Subsequent analy - sis using different anti - p85 mAbs exhibiting either chicken - specific reactivity or species crossreactivity showed that all three p85 bands were immunologically related ( data not shown ) . mAbs to pl85 / p64 were directed to a protein of 185 kDa that was not phosphorylated in CEFs expressing pp60s1 but was coimmunoprecipitated with a tyrosine - phosphory - lated protein of 64 kDa . All of the proteins immunoprecipi - tated by the individual mAbs contained P - Tyr as determined by phospho amino acid analysis of 32P - labeled proteins ( data not shown ) . Characterization of the mAbs , including the molecular masses of the proteins they recognize , their reactivity in immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays , their isotype , and their species crossreactivities , is summarized in Table 1 .

Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 87 ( 1990 ) 3331 assays . Interestingly , fusion of spleen cells from two different immunized mice yielded a distinct repertoire of mAbs to the antigen mixture used for immunization . Many of the mAbs crossreacted with the same proteins in mouse , rat , hamster , and human cells in immunoprecipitation assays ; however , several were specific for chicken proteins , demonstrating the presence of conserved and nonconserved antigenic determi - nants . Finally , the predominant isotype was IgG1 , although several mAbs were of the IgG2 , IgG3 , or IgM isotype . To determine whether the mAbs to individual tyrosine phosphoproteins were directed to polypeptide sequences or to P - Tyr , phospho amino acids were used to block the immunoprecipitation of the individual proteins . mAbs to four individual tyrosine phosphoproteins were not inhibited by P - Tyr or phosphoserine ( Fig . 3B ) . In addition , preincubation with P - Tyr did not block the immunoprecipitation with mAbs to p210 , p118 , p110 , or p185 / p64 ( data not shown ) . However , in control experiments ( Fig . 3A ) , the proteins immunopre - cipitated by an anti - P - Tyr mAb ( lane 1 ) were not detected after immunoprecipitation using mAb preincubated with P - Tyr ( lane 2 ) or phenyl phosphate ( lane 5 ) , whereas neither phosphoserine nor phosphothreonine inhibited the immuno - precipitation ( lanes 3 and 4 ) . None of the phospho amino acids abrogated the immunoprecipitation of pp6src or the two phosphoproteins associated with activated pp6SrC ( lanes 6 - 10 ) . These data indicate that the mAbs were directed to determinants other than P - Tyr . Analysis of immunopre - cipitates from cells labeled with [ 35S ] methionine and 32p , revealed that each mAb immunoprecipitated its respective protein , although several mAbs coimmunoprecipitated addi - tional cell proteins . The nature of these protein complexes remains to be determined . Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Common Substrates in CEFs Expressing v - src , v - yes , or v - crk . Acute type - C avian retrovi - ruses contain transforming oncogenes , many of which en - code tyrosine kinases . In addition to RSV , which encodes pp60V - Src , the Y73 retrovirus encodes the tyrosine kinase pp90gagYes ( 14 ) , and CT10 expresses an oncogene product without intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , p47g9rk , although infection of CEFs with CT10 results in the novel tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins ( 32 ) . To deter - A a - pTyr a - src I I B Cu - pI30 a - pl25 m - - r * I mine whether these viruses induced the tyrosine phosphor - ylation of common cellular protein substrates , p130 , p125 , p120 , p110 , and p85 were immunoprecipitated with their respective mAbs from CEFs infected with Y73 , CT10 , or RSV . Anti - P - Tyr immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates showed that p130 , p125 , and p110 were all phosphorylated on tyrosine to different levels in CEFs expressing the three different viruses ( Fig . 4 ) . Increased p125 phosphorylation was assessed by a shift in mobility . In contrast , only the tyrosine kinases pp6Osrc and pp909YcS phosphorylated p120 and p85 on tyrosine . Thus , although these protein substrates were initially identified in CEFs transformed by activated forms of pp6src , they were also targets of at least one other tyrosine kinase . DISCUSSION The generation of anti - P - Tyr has facilitated the study of cellular protein substrates of tyrosine kinases ( 13 , 15 , 16 , 23 , 24 ) . However , analysis of individual proteins is limited with these antibodies in systems with multiple tyrosine phos - phoproteins . Here we report the generation of mAbs to individual tyrosine - phosphorylated cellular substrates of the tyrosine kinase pp6Osrc . Hybridomas producing mAbs to eight different tyrosine phosphoproteins , p210 , p130 , p125 , p120 , p118 , pllO , p85 , and p185 / p64 , were derived from two separate fusions of spleen cells from mice immunized with immunoaffinity - purified tyrosine phosphoproteins from CEFs expressing activated forms of pp60srC . These mAbs detected the same proteins in both avian and mammalian cells and were directed to protein targets of several tyrosine kinases . In addition , we have also generated mAbs to P - Tyr by immunization with cellular substrates of tyrosine kinases . In CEFs expressing the v - yes oncogene , p85 and , to a lesser extent , p120 and p110 were phosphorylated on tyro - sine . Although the level of oncogene expression appeared to be comparable ( data not shown ) , the level of tyrosine phos - phorylation of these proteins was reduced relative to that observed in v - src - transformed CEFs . This might be due to differences in subcellular localization of the activated kinase or differences in substrate affinity and / or specificity .

These diverse cellular processes may include common cel - lular protein substrates that become phosphorylated on ty - rosine in response to different cell stimuli . The identities of the proteins detected by the mAbs remain unknown . However , we have eliminated several possibilities by assaying immunocomplexes directly for enzymatic activ - ity or crossreactivity with available antisera to known pro - teins . None of the mAbs immunoprecipitated type I phos - phatidylinositol kinase activity ( 40 ) , except for the anti - P - Tyr mAbs ( data not shown ) . In immunoblot assays , immunopre - cipitates of p85 were not detected by antibodies to protein kinase C and immunoprecipitates of protein kinase C were not detected by mAbs to p85 ; immunoprecipitates of p110 were not detected by antibodies to chicken a - actinin , and vice versa ; immunoprecipitates of p120 were not detected by antibodies to the fibronectin receptor , and vice versa ; and immunoprecipitates of the p185 / p64 complex were not de - tected with antibodies to GTPase - activating protein ( 41 ) , and vice versa ( data not shown ) . It is possible that one or more of the proteins recognized by our mAbs may be involved in receptor complexes similar to those reported between the platelet - derived growth factor 8 receptor and Raf - 1 ( 22 ) . Recently , methods similar to those described here were used to generate mAbs to individual CEF - derived tyrosine phos - phoproteins ( 21 ) , revealing a different repertoire of mAbs . It is unclear whether our mAbs are directed to any of the same protein substrates as those reported ( 21 ) . We thank D . Koons and W .
