Signature : Abstract Endocytosis is both an ancient and a diverse feature of the eukaryotic cell . Studying how it evolved can provide insight into the nature of the last common eukaryotic ancestor , and the diversification of eukaryotes into the known extant lineages . In this thesis , I present two studies on the evolution of endocytosis . In the first part of the thesis I report results from a large - scale , phylogenetic and comparative genomic study of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . The CME pathway has been studied to a great level of detail in yeast to mammal model organisms . Several protein families have now been identified as part of the complex set of protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions which mediate endocytosis . To investigate how such complexity evolved , first , I defined the modular nature of the CME interactome ( CME - I ) by literature review , and then I carried out a systematic phylogenetic and protein domain architecture analysis of the proteins involved . These data were used to construct a model of the evolution of the CME - I network , and to map the expansion of the network ' s complexity to the eukaryotic tree of life . In the second part of the thesis , I present results from evolutionary and functional studies of the eisosome , a protein complex which has been proposed to regulate the spatial distribution of endocytosis in S . cerevisiae . The phylogeny of eisosomes components Pil1 and Lsp1 reported here , suggests that eisosomes are likely to have originated at the base of the fungi , and then diversified significantly via multiple gene duplications . I thus studied the localisation and function of Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues in Magnaporthe oryzae to investigate the role of eisosomes in filamentous fungi . Results suggests that eisosomes are linked with septal formation and integrity in M . oryzae , and that the septal specific Pil2 paralogue was lost in budding yeasts . Together , the data presented in this thesis describe the evolutionary history of a complex biological system , but also highlights the problem of asymmetry in the understanding of endocytic diversity in the eukaryotes .

This process was first reported by Elie Metchnikoff in 1883 , when he demonstrated that specialised mobile cells in starfish larvae engaged in an immune response by swallowing infecting agents ( Metchnikoff , 1883 ) . The process was termed phagocytosis ( from Greek word phago meaning ' to eat ' ) . The internalisation of fluid medium via the invagination of the plasma membrane was first reported in 1931 ( Lewis , 1931 ) with the introduction of the term ' pinocytosis ' ( from Greek word pino meaning ' drinking ' ) . Following these early studies , endocytosis has emerged as an important cellular process , involved in a wide breadth of vital functions . These include the immune response ( Stuart & Ezekowitz , 2008 ) , nutrient uptake ( Robibaro et al . , 2001 ) , cell signalling ( Polo & Di Fiore , 2006 ) , cell growth ( Higuchi et al . , 2009 ) , cell differentiation ( Romih & Jezernik , 1994 ) , synaptic activity ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ) , maintaining cell homeostasis ( Covian - Nares et al . , 2008 ) and recycling plasma membrane and its components ( Schneider et al . , 1979 ) . While much of the research to date has focused on metazoan and yeast model organisms , there are some studies of endocytosis which cover the wider diversity of the eukaryotes , for instance filamentous fungi ( Fuchs & Steinberg , 2005 ) , Viridiplantae ( Irani & Russinova , 2009 ; Raven et al . , 2009 ) , and protists lineages such as alveolates ( e . g . Paramecium ) ( Allen & Fok , 1980 ) , kinetoplastids ( e . g . Trypanosoma ) ( Gabernet - 17 Chapter 1 Castello et al . , 2009 ) and diplomonads ( e . g . Giardia ) ( Hernandez et al . , 2007 ) . Because of the range of cellular functions mediated by endocytosis and the diversity of taxa it has been studied within , endocytosis is considered an important hallmark of eukaryotic cells ( Field et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast , only recently have cellular uptake functions similar to endocytosis been identified in a prokaryotic organism , as experiments on the planctomycete Gemmata obscuriglobus , which has a compartmentalised cell plan and coat - like proteins ( Santarella - Mellwig et al . , 2010 ) , demonstrate energy - dependent internalisation of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) ( Lonhienne et al . , 2010 ) . The evolutionary history of endocytosis may therefore provide insight into the transition between prokaryote and eukaryote life forms . Here I discuss how endocytosis relates to the origin of eukaryotes ( eukaryogenesis ) in light of the leading hypotheses regarding the origins of eukaryotes and the diversity and types of endocytosis identified in eukaryotic cells . 1 . 1 . 1 Endocytosis in eukaryogenesis There are diverse hypotheses that account for the origin of eukaryotes , with different implications regarding the importance of endocytosis to this process ( Cavalier - Smith , 2009 ; Gribaldo et al . , 2010 ; Martin et al . , 2001 ) . One class of hypotheses states that eukaryotes originated from a chimeric cell which resulted from metabolic symbiosis ( syntrophy ) between two prokaryotes ( Martin et al . , 2001 ) ( Figure 1 . 1 a - d ) . For instance , Margulis et al . argue that the nucleus evolved from the merging of a Thermoplasma - like archaeon and Spirochaeta - like bacterium ( Margulis et al . , 2000 ) ( Figure 1 . 1a ) . The syntrophic relationship conferred a selective advantage because the hypothetical archaeon generated hydrogen sulfide and the bacterium oxidised sulfide to 18 Chapter 1 sulfur ( Margulis et al . , 2000 ) . Another hypothesis argues that eukaryotes originated from syntrophy between a methanogenic archaeon and δ - protobacterium ( Moreira & Lopez - Garcia , 1998 ) ( Figure 1 . 1b ) . Key to this hypothesis is the transfer of hydrogen in anaerobic environments . The methane produced by the archaeon is metabolised into hydrogen by the bacterium , conferring selective advantage ( Moreira & Lopez - Garcia , 1998 ) . The hydrogen hypothesis also proposes that the first eukaryote cell originated from hydrogen - based syntrophy between two prokaryotes ( Martin & Muller , 1998 ) . It argues that the first eukaryote cell originated from a hydrogen - dependent and autotrophic archaeon , which engaged in metabolic symbiosis with a bacterium that respired but also produced hydrogen from anaerobic heterotrophic metabolism ( Figure 1 . 1c ) . Importantly , however , this hypothesis argues that syntrophy led to the origin of the mitochondrion , and not the nucleus , as the defining eukaryotic acquisition ( Martin & Muller , 1998 ) . The strength of syntrophic models of eukaryote origin is that they account for selective advantage of the novel chimeric cell . They also explain the different ancestry of eukaryotic genes with the Archaea and Bacteria , with informational genes ( e . g . involved in transcription and translation ) more closely related to Archaea and operations genes ( e . g . involved in cellular metabolic processes ) more closely related to Bacteria ( Rivera & Lake , 2004 ) . Yet the resolution among these genes is too weak to identify which prokaryotic lineages were involved in this endosymbiosis ( Gribaldo et al . , 2010 ) . However , because syntrophy putatively occurred between two prokaryotes , and phagocytosis is currently defined as a eukaryotic feature , it does not explain how one 19 Chapter 1 20 Chapter 1 prokaryote could have engulfed the other . Endosymbiosis between two prokaryotes has , in fact , been observed ( von Dohlen et al . , 2001 ) although it appears to be exceedingly rare . Having said that , the hydrogen hypothesis argues that phagocytosis , or any other form of endocytosis are not prerequisites for the host cell to acquire the symbiont . Rather , it argues that because the host would have benefited from sticking tightly to symbionts , it simply grew around the symbiont to prevent its escape ( Martin & Muller , 1998 ) . In contrast to the syntrophic model of eukaryote origin , other hypotheses argue that a 21 Figure 1 . 1 Syntrophic and autogenous scenarios of eukarote origin . A schematic summary of a selection of leading eukaryotgenesis hypotheses , devided into those proposing a syntrophic origin ( a - d ) , and those proposing an autogenous origin of the eukaryotic cell ( e - g ) . a Thermoplasma - like archaeon and Spirochaeta - like bacteria together formed a protoeukaryote " Thiodendron " stage based on syntrophic exchange of sulfur , from which a nucleated cell with a karyomastigont evolved ( Margulis et al . , 2000 ) . b Methanogenic archaeon and δ - protobacterium form a syntrophic consortium based on interspecies hydrogen transfer . Following bacterial cytoplasmic fusion the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclar pores evolve ( Moreira & Lopez - Garcia , 1998 ) . c Hydrogen dependent autotrophic archaeon enters syntrophic relationship with respiring bacterium , which is eventually engulfed and evolves into the mitochondrion ( Martin & Muller , 1998 ) . d Methanogenic archaeon and δ - protobacterium fuse to form nucleated cell . The mitochondrial ancestor then acquired , thus driving the autogenous evolution of the endomembrane system ( Lopez - Garcia & Moreira , 2006 ) . e A cell type distinct from Archaea and Eubacteria , i . e . the chronocyte , evolves cytoskeleton , endomembranes and phagotrophy , eventually engulfing prokaryotes and evolving a DNA - based nucleus ( Hartman & Fedorov , 2002 ) . f A protoeukaryote lineage , sister to the Archaea , having acquired a flexible surface coat , autogenously evolves phagotrophy , which in turn drives the evolution of the eukaryotic organelles and engulfment of the endosymbiont mitochondrial ancestor ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ) . g A protoeukaryote lineage evolves an endomembrane secretory system , which allows for the evolution of phagotrophic predation and eventually the engulfment of the mitochondrial endosymbiont ( Jekely , 2007 ) . Chapter 1 protoeukaryote lineage autogenously evolved eukaryotic features such as the tubulin and actin cytoskeleton , the endomembrane system and , importantly , phagotrophy , which allowed it to engulf the free - living bacterial ancestor of mitochondria ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 , 2010 ; Hartman & Fedorov , 2002 ; Jekely , 2007 ; O ' Malley , 2010 ) ( Figure 1 . 1 d - f ) . One such hypothesis , referred here as the neomuran - phagotrophy hypothesis , argues that phagocytosis was the prerequisite of all other eukaryote features ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ) . It suggests that the first key eukaryote acquisition was a flexible surface coat which was made possible by replacement of bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall components with N - linked glycoproteins ( i . e . ' neomura ' , meaning new wall ) . This conferred cell surface flexibility . The first eukaryote could then lose the typically prokaryote exoskeleton and evolve phagocytosis , which would in turn lead to the origin of other eukaryote - specific traits ( Figure 1 . 1 f ) ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ) . Another hypothesis , based on a study of ras GTPase diversification , argues that a secretory endomembrane system , ancestor of the endoplasmic reticulum , the Golgi apparatus and possibly even the nucleus , evolved prior to phagocytosis ( Jekely , 2003 , 2007 ) . This model proposes that an endomembrane system , based on the formation of tubules and vesicles , evolved in concordance with a secretory system . This eventually allowed the membrane remodelling around the prey to be coordinated with the secretion of digestive enzymes and nutrient uptake , as necessitated by phagotrophic predation ( Figure 1 . 1 g ) ( Jekely , 2003 ) . A further hypothesis is based on a study of eukaryotic signature proteins ( ESPs ) ( Hartman & Fedorov , 2002 ) . ESPs are a minimal set of proteins present in diverse eukaryotic groups . The authors argue that this set of proteins means eukaryogenesis entail three cellular domains : Archaea , Bacteria and a distinct 22 Chapter 1 cell named the Chronocyte ( Hartman & Fedorov , 2002 ) . The analysis of ESPs suggests that the chronocyte , a RNA - based cell which acted as the host cell in this eukaryogenesis model , had a complex cytoskeleton and an endomembrane system allowing it to engulf prokaryotic symbionts which in turn introduced DNA - based genetic systems and the nucleus ( Figure 1 . 1e ) ( Hartman & Fedorov , 2002 ) . The strength of eukaryogenesis hypotheses based on autogenous - first models is that they allow the proto - mitochondrial host to perform phagocytosis . It has in fact been argued that these hypotheses do not provide a satisfactory selective advantage for the protoeukaryote to evolve features such as a complex cytoskeleton and an endomembrane system ( Martin et al . , 2001 ; Martin & Muller , 1998 ) . However , one of these models proposes a strong selective advantage for cells that evolved phagocytic predation via the prior evolution of a functional secretory endomembrane system ( Jekely , 2007 ) . It has also been suggested that a complex cellular organisation and membrane - trafficking system conferred greater potential for increased cell volume , complexity of cellular function , and flexibility of how these functions are performed ( Dacks & Field , 2007 ; Field et al . , 2011 ) . An interesting hypothesis combines elements of syntrophic symbiosis with autogenous evolution . As for the hypothesis by Moreira & Lopez - Garcia , it suggests that the nucleus evolved from syntrophic symbiosis between a methanogenic archaeon and a δ - protobacterium ( Moreira & Lopez - Garcia , 1998 ) . However , it also argues that following the acquisition of a respiring endosymbiont , the chimeric cell autogenously evolved a nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum from bacterial membranes ( Figure 1 . 1d ) . The hypothesis specifies two selective forces , applied sequentially : first , the metabolic compartmentalisation to avoid deleterious interference of opposite anabolic 23 Chapter 1 and catabolic pathways , and second the prevention of deleterious spreading of aberrant proteins in cytoplasm as introns become widespread in the nuclear genome ( Lopez - Garcia & Moreira , 2006 ) . This theoretical elaboration attempts to explain how some eukaryotic organelles have exogenous origins while others evolved autogenously , but it should be noted that it fundamentally belongs to the syntrophic model of eukaryogenesis , because it is still proposing that the primary event in the origin of eukaryotes is the syntrophic merge of two prokaryotes ( Figure 1 . 1 d ) ( Lopez - Garcia & Moreira , 2006 ) . Indeed , it is widely accepted that organelles such as mitochondria , plastids and respective derivations have exogenous origins but other eukaryotic organelles were autogenously acquired ( Martin , 1999 ) , so the real question is what is the primary event , the acquisition of exogenous organelles or of autogenous organelles ? According to autogenous - first models for eukaryogenesis , endocytosis and specifically phagocytosis were key acquisitions of the protoeukaryote cell , which predated the acquisition of mitochondria and even the nucleus and other organelles ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ; Yutin et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , according to these models , the evolution of endocytosis was strongly linked with the evolution of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and the endomembrane system ( Cavalier - Smith , 2009 ; Jekely , 2007 ) . By contrast , syntrophic ( or exogenous - first ) models entail endocytosis - independent processes for the primary endosymbiotic event which led to origin of eukaryotes . As mentioned above , one such process has been described in the context of the hydrogen hypothesis ( Martin & Muller , 1998 ) . Also , the syntrophic hypothesis by Moreira posits that within colonial congregations of prokaryote cells engaged in metabolic symbiosis , 24 Chapter 1 cells merged to form the chimeric eukaryote ( Moreira & Lopez - Garcia , 1998 ) . It is difficult to test hypotheses of how the first eukaryote arose because no extant intermediate lineage has been sampled . The archezoan hypothesis first suggested that amitochondriate lineages such as Giardia , Trichomonas , Entamoeba and Microsporidia derived from primitive anaerobic eukaryotes which had not undergone mitochondrial endosymbiosis ( Cavalier - Smith , 1983a ; Cavalier - Smith , 1983b ) , thereby providing examples of a pre - mitochondrial phase of eukaryote evolution . Initially , phylogenies based on ribosomal RNA encoding gene were consistent with the hypothesis ( Leipe et al . , 1993 ; Sogin et al . , 1989 ; Vossbrinck et al . , 1987 ) , but further studies revealed that ' archezoans ' in fact harboured organelles which share common ancestry with mitochondria ( Embley et al . , 2003 ; Tovar et al . , 1999 ; van der Giezen & Tovar , 2005 ; Williams et al . , 2002 ) . The early branching positions of archezoan candidates , were thus dismissed as an artifact due to long branch attraction ( Embley & Hirt , 1998 ; Philippe et al . , 2000 ) . No other eukaryotic lineage derived from a pre - mitochondrial phase of cell evolution has been identified ( Embley , 2006 ) . Arguably , before the nature of the first eukaryote common ancestor can be defined we need to characterise the last common ancestor of known extant eukaryotic lineages . 1 . 1 . 2 Endocytosis in the last common eukaryotic ancestor Evidence from recent phylogenomic studies suggests that the last common eukaryotic ancestor ( LCEA ) encoded several protein families responsible for a range of key eukaryotic cellular features . These include meiosis ( Ramesh et al . , 2005 ) , centrioles ( Hodges et al . , 2010 ) , a diversified DNA replisome ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) , intron - dominated 25 Chapter 1 genomes ( Koonin , 2009 ) , and diversified actin and tubulin associated motor proteins ( Richards & Cavalier - Smith , 2005 ; Wickstead & Gull , 2007 ; Wickstead et al . , 2010 ) . Importantly , data shows the LCEA also possessed a complex endomembrane system where specialisation and compartmentalisation evolved via gene family expansions of multiple paralogues ( Dacks & Field , 2007 ; Dacks et al . , 2009 ; Dacks et al . , 2008 ) . Phylogenomic studies have identified some of the gene families involved in the ancient endomembrane system , for which gene duplication coupled with specialisation was confirmed ( Field et al . , 2006 ; Pereira - Leal & Seabra , 2001 ; Yoshizawa et al . , 2006 ) . A link between the evolution of the endomembrane system and endocytosis is suggested by paralogues of endocytic adaptins and epsin - related proteins , localising at different sites of the membrane trafficking system such as endosomes , Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum ( Dacks et al . , 2008 ; Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) . This predicts the LCEA also possessed a complex and diversified endocytic system . Data showing that the endocytic proteins clathrin and the AP2 complex were present in the LCEA is consistent with the prediction ( Field et al . , 2006 ) . However , there is likely to be further complexity and diversity in the endocytic systems of the putative LCEA , especially in light of the mechanistic diversity of endocytic pathways studied thus far in eukaryotes ( see Section 1 . 3 ) ( Conner & Schmid , 2003 ; Kumari et al . , 2010 ) . Clathrin and the AP2 complex putatively formed vesicle coats in the endomembrane system of the LCEA , but what about the rest of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis pathway ? And what about other endocytic pathways in the LCEA ? Did for example the LCEA evolve a range of specialised endocytic machineries , and what is the range of molecular mechanisms it employed for endocytic functions such as membrane deformation , 26 Chapter 1 vesicle scission , vesicle transport and vesicle coat recycling ? It is important to investigate endocytosis in the LCEA and provide further insight into nature of the ancestral cell . 1 . 1 . 3 Evolutionary history of endocytosis Given the putative presence of endocytosis in the LCEA and its role in eukaryotic evolution it is important to investigate its evolutionary history . However , phagocytosis and pinocytosis are distinct processes , and within these broad categories there is further functional specification ( Conner & Schmid , 2003 ) . The evolutionary relationships among different endocytic pathways in not known . The approach I propose is thus to map pathway specific proteins and functions to eukaryotic diversity . This can be summarised in three steps : 1 . Outline a consensus eukaryotic phylogeny from existing studies , highlighting major eukaryotic groups and alternative rooting hypotheses . 2 . Identify and characterise endocytic genes involved in distinct endocytic pathways from literature review . This step involves a critical evaluation of the cell and molecular biology data which support the functional assignment prediction of candidate pathway components . 3 . Predict the occurrence of distinct endocytic pathways across eukaryotic diversity by tracing the evolutionary distribution of endocytic genes specific to a given pathway . 27 Chapter 1 1 . 2 Eukaryote diversification Eukaryogenesis constitutes a major evolutionary leap which brought radical changes to the structure and function of the cell ( Cavalier - Smith , 2006 ) . In no specific order of importance or ancestry , these changes include a flexible cell surface and phagotrophy ( Cavalier - Smith , 2009 ) , a novel internal organisation regulated by a cytoskeleton and complement motor proteins ( Cavalier - Smith , 1975 ; Richards & Cavalier - Smith , 2005 ; Wickstead et al . , 2010 ) an endomembrane system of vesicle trafficking ( Dacks & Field , 2007 ) , compartmentalisation of informational and operational activity by a nuclear envelope ( Koonin & Aravind , 2009 ; Neumann et al . , 2010 ) , a new system of duplication and sexual reproduction via mitosis and meiosis ( Cavalier - Smith , 2010 ; Ramesh et al . , 2005 ) , a complex genomic structure featuring spliceosomal introns ( Koonin , 2006 , 2009 ) , and a novel metabolic make - up characterised by compartmentalised biochemistry ( i . e . mitochondria , peroxisomes , and in some eukaryotes , plastids ) ( Lane & Martin , 2010 ) . The effort to resolve the order of the cellular modifications and the early branching order of the eukaryotic tree has been hampered by the inability to identify an extant bona fide intermediate protoeukaryote lineage where only part of these changes have occurred ( Embley , 2006 ) . The eukaryote tree topology is therefore a matter of contention , as the early branching order has not been resolved and the root of tree has not been pinpointed with any degree of confidence ( Roger & Simpson , 2009 ) . The current consensus eukaryotic tree is represented by a polytomy of the major monophyletic eukaryote groups which have been recognised and supported by 28 Chapter 1 molecular phylogenies ( Baldauf , 2008 ) . It has been suggested that this model reflects an evolutionary ' Big Bang ' ( i . e . a hard polytomy ) whereby rapid eukaryote diversification occurred perhaps following mitochondrial endosymbiosis ( Philippe & Adoutte , 1998 ; Philippe et al . , 2000 ) . However , the under - representation of protist taxa in broad eukaryote phylogenies ( Dacks et al . , 2002 ) , the loss of evolutionary signal by the saturation of character change ( Ho & Jermiin , 2004 ) , large number of secondary endosymbiotic events and horizontal gene transfer events ( Archibald , 2009 ; Archibald & Richards , 2010 ) and limitations in phylogenetic methods ( Penny et al . , 2001 ) may all contribute to the lack of resolution in deep parts of the eukaryotic tree . Here , I briefly review the main eukaryotic groups which form the consensus tree used in this thesis as a phylogenetic framework . I also discuss evolutionary relationships between major groups and alternative rootings of the eukaryotic tree . 1 . 2 . 1 Major eukaryote super - groups The traditional five kingdom structure divided the diversity of life into three levels of organisation : prokaryotic ( kingdom Monera ) , unicellular eukaryotic ( kingdom Protista ) , and multicellular eukaryotic ( the Plantae , the Fungi and the Animalia kingdoms ) ( Whittaker , 1969 ) . This was the first system to formally recognise Fungi as a kingdom . The organisation of the eukaryotes into protista and the three multicellular kingdoms was popularly used until the 21st century . However , with the increased availability of molecular data relative to diverse protists and the improvement of phylogenetic methods , a new organisation of eukaryotes was proposed ( Simpson & Roger , 2004 ) . The revised system improved biological realism by dividing eukaryotic lineages into 29 Chapter 1 major monophyletic groups , thus ridding of the discrimination between unicellular and multicellular levels of organisation ( Adl et al . , 2005 ; Simpson & Roger , 2004 ) . The major groups , or supergroups are briefly reviewed . Opisthokonta are designated as the exclusive grouping of metazoans , fungi and multiple protist groups such as free - living choanoflagellates , parasitic Ichthyosporea , the amoeboids with filose pseudopods known as nucleariids , and the aerobic protists with long projecting tentacles known as filastereans ( Cavalier - Smith & Chao , 1995 , 2003 ; Ragan et al . , 1996 ; Zettler et al . , 2001 ; Shalchian - Tabrizi et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , the cellular slime mould Fonticula has recently been placed within the opisthokonts by phylogenetic means ( Brown et al . , 2009 ) . This group has been confirmed as monophyletic by several single gene and multi gene phylogenetic analyses ( Carr et al . , 2008 ; Cavalier - Smith & Chao , 2003 ; Lang et al . , 2002 ; Ruiz - Trillo et al . , 2006 ; Shalchian - Tabrizi et al . , 2008 ; Steenkamp et al . , 2006 ) . There are also morphological synapomorphies associated with opisthokonts , specifically unicellular motile stages bearing a single posterior flagellum and flattened mitochondrial cristae ( Cavalier - Smith & Chao , 2003 ; Zettler et al . , 2001 ) . Finally , a molecular synapomorphy consisting in a unique ~ 12 amino acid insertion in the elongation factor protein EF1 - α supports opisthokont monophyly ( Baldauf & Palmer , 1993 ; Steenkamp et al . , 2006 ) . Amoebozoa include highly divergent lineages such as amoebae with broad pseudopodia ( e . g . Amoeba ) , cellular and plasmodial slime moulds ( e . g . Dictyostelium and Physarum respectively ) and anaerobic , mitochondria - lacking commensal or parasitic lineages such as Entamoeba ( Bapteste et al . , 2002 ; Nikolaev et al . , 2006 ; Smirnov et al . , 2005 ) . Early 30 Chapter 1 rRNA - based phylogenies did not recover the monophyly of these groups , placing some taxa at the deepest branching level of the eukaryotes ( Hinkle et al . , 1994 ; Pawlowski et al . , 1996 ) . However , multi - gene analyses with improved phylogenetic methods produced phylogenies supporting the monophyly of the amoebozoan group and , importantly , helped determine that amitochondriate amoebozoans had secondarily lost their mitochondria ( Baldauf et al . , 2000 ; Bapteste et al . , 2002 ) . According to the revised taxonomic system , the Archaeplastida are a supergroup consisting of three major lineages - Chloroplastida ( land plants and green algae ) , Rhodophyta ( red algae ) and Glaucophyta ( unicellular algae ) - which descended from the eukaryotic host of the primary endosymbiotic plastid ( Adl et al . , 2005 ) . The origin of these lineages from a single primary endosymbiotic event is indicated by molecular evolution data which focuses on plastid - encoded genes and their comparison with nuclear - encoded genes ( Bachvaroff et al . , 2005 ; Bhattacharya & Medlin , 1995 ; Douglas & Turner , 1991 ; Martin et al . , 1998b ; Rodriguez - Ezpeleta et al . , 2005 ) . The monophyly of the Archaeplastida is demonstrated by substantial phylogenomic data based on multi - gene analyses of both plastid and nuclear genes . ( Moreira et al . , 2000 ; Reyes - Prieto & Bhattacharya , 2007 ; Rodriguez - Ezpeleta et al . , 2005 ; Rodriguez - Ezpeleta et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , the presence of two ancestrally cyanobacterial membranes binding the plastids is an ultrastructural trait of the Archaeplastida , as it is in contrast with the presence of more than two plastid binding membranes in lineages that evolved from secondary or tertiary plastid endosymbiosis ( Jarvis & Soll , 2002 ; Moreira & Philippe , 2001 ; Tomas & Cox , 1973 ) . 31 Chapter 1 The taxonomic group Rhizaria was initially proposed as an ' infrakingdom ' including major amoeboid protist lineages characterised by root - like filose or reticulose pseudopodia , many of whom previously known as ' rhizopods ' , namely Cercozoa , Foraminifera , Retaria , Apusozoa and Heliozoa ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ) . Early molecular evolution data suggested phyla Cercozoa and Foraminifera were indeed closely related ( Berney & Pawlowski , 2003 ; Keeling , 2001 ) . However , a subsequent phylogenetic study based on RNA small subunits and actin , the first one to extensively sample putatively rhizarian taxa , redefined Rhizaria as monophyletic and one of the main eukaryotic supergroups , but with the collapse of Heliozoa , shown to be polyphyletic and therefore not a real group , and the exclusion of Apusozoa , the latter branching in an entirely different part of the eukaryote tree ( Nikolaev et al . , 2004 ) . More recent molecular evolution data , based on multi - gene phylogenetic analyses , confirmed monophyly of Rhizaria ( Burki & Pawlowski , 2006 ; Burki et al . , 2007 ; Hampl et al . , 2009 ) , and within Rhizaria , monophyly of Foraminifera and Radiozoa ( Radiolaria minus Phaeodarea ) to form the Retaria group ( Moreira et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , a single or double amino - acid insertion in universal eukaryotic protein polyubiquitin has been recognised as unique to Cercozoa and Foraminifera ( Archibald et al . , 2003 ; Bass et al . , 2005 ) . Chromalveolata is a group proposed to contain the former kingdom Chromista ( heterokonts , haptophytes and cryptophytes ) , and infrakingdom Alveolata ( ciliates , apicomplexans and dinoflagellates ) , as they both putatively arose from a secondary endosymbiotic event whereby a heterotrophic bikont enslaved a red algae and subsequently became photosynthetic ( Adl et al . , 2005 ; Cavalier - Smith , 1999 ; Harper et 32 Chapter 1 al . , 2005 ) . This grouping can be validated by demonstrating that indeed there was a single secondary endosymbiotic event at the root of all chromalveolates , and also that the several diverse chromalveolate lineages are monophyletic . Both points are in fact contentious . On the issue of plastid inheritance , there are major lineages within the chromalveolates , such as the heterokont oomycetes , the alveolate ciliates and some dinoflagellates , that are not photosynthetic and are believed not to possess plastids ( Archibald , 2009 ) . According to the ' chromalveolate hypothesis ' , this is due to secondary loss of plastid and photosynthetic functions ( Cavalier - Smith , 1999 ) . So far , there have been significant findings of nuclear genes with plastid functions in non - photosynthetic organisms , such as the dinoflagellates Oxyrrhis and Crypthecodinium ( Sanchez - Puerta et al . , 2007 ; Slamovits & Keeling , 2008 ) , which suggests these lineages only secondarily lost plastids and related functions . Similarly , secondary loss is suggested by the finding of 16 proteins of possible algal origin in non - photosynthetic ciliates Tetrahymena and Paramecium ( Reyes - Prieto et al . , 2008 ) . However , critics of the chromalveolate hypothesis point out that horizontal gene transfer between cyanobacterial and ciliate lineages has been documented and therefore reduces the significance of this finding ( Ricard et al . , 2006 ) , and a recent study comparing phylogenies obtained from plastid , mitochondrial and nuclear genes supports the idea of independent secondary plastid acquisitions within Chromalveolata ( Baurain et al . , 2010 ) . With regards to monophyly of the chromalveolates , phylogenomic data based on multi - gene analyses suggest that alveolates and heterokonts are sister groups , and so are the haptophytes and cryptophytes , but that together the four lineage do not constitute a monophyletic chromalveolate supergroup ( Burki et al . , 2009 ; Burki et al . , 2007 ; Hackett et al . , 2007 ; Hampl et al . , 2009 ; Harper et al . , 2005 ; Minge et al . , 2009 ; Patron 33 Chapter 1 et al . , 2007 ) . This is in great part due to the unexpected branching position of Rhizaria , which in most multi - gene phylogenetic analyses is shown to be sister to the alveolates / heterokonts clade ( Burki et al . , 2009 ; Hackett et al . , 2007 ; Minge et al . , 2009 ) , with one multi - gene analysis even suggesting Rhizaria and heterokonts are a monophyletic group , sister to the alveolates ( Burki et al . , 2007 ) . This further complicates the ' chromalveolate hypothesis ' as it would entail that all Rhizaria secondarily lost the red algal endosymbiont . Excavata is a major eukaryote taxon proposed to include several of the unicellular flagellates previously thought to be deep - branching in the eukaryote tree ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ) . The defining criteria of this grouping are shared ultrastructural characters , the main one consisting of a distinctive suspension - feeding groove and an associated cytoskeletal system ( Simpson , 2003 ) . Some lineages have also been grouped in the Excavata according to molecular evidence ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ; Dacks et al . , 2001 ) . The group is contentious because an initial comprehensive multi - gene phylogeny did not depict excavates as a monophyletic group ( Simpson et al . , 2006 ) . However , a recent analysis focused on correcting long branch attraction artifacts indicates that Excavata are likely to be monophyletic and confirms three main sub - groups : Metamonada which are composed of anaerobes without classical mitochondria ( i . e . Giardia and Trichomonas ) , Discoba which are composed of Discicristata ( with discoid cristae on mitochondria i . e . Trypanosoma and Naegleria ) and Jakobida , and Malawinomas ( Hampl et al . , 2009 ) . 34 Chapter 1 35 Figure 1 . 2 The diversity of eukaryotes : from 4 kingdoms to 6 ' supergroups ' . a The popular 5 kingdom system organised life forms according to three levels of organisation : Monera ( prokaryotes ) , Protista ( unicellular eukaryotes ) , and the three eukaryotic multicellular kingdoms ( Plantae , Fungi and Animalia ) ( Whittaker , 1969 ) . b A six supergroups system of eukaryote diversity is proposed . Rather than levels of cellular organisation , this sytem is based on the establishment of major monophyletic groups by molecular phylogenetics and improved knowledge of the diversity of protists ( Simpson & Roger , 2004 ) . Chapter 1 1 . 2 . 2 Outline of a consensus eukaryotic tree of life Resolving the phylogenetic relationships between the major groups of eukaryotes is key to pinpointing the root of the eukaryotic tree . A leading hypothesis places the root between ' unikonts ' and ' bikonts ' ( Stechmann & Cavalier - Smith , 2003 ) where unikonts evolved from a cell with a single cilium - bearing centriole and includes the Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa , whereas bikonts descend from a biciliate cell with a younger anterior cilium and include Archaeplastida and all other protists ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ) ( Figure 1 . 1a ) . This idea is based on the identification of a bikont specific derived gene fusion ( Stechmann & Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ) and of unikont specific myosin domain structures ( Richards & Cavalier - Smith , 2005 ) . While the ' unikont ' clade is robustly supported by phylogenomic evidence ( Burki et al . , 2007 ; Hampl et al . , 2009 ) , ' bikonts ' are still contentious and not all analyses are consistent with this putative root ( Roger & Simpson , 2009 ; Rogozin et al . , 2009 ) . Other rooting scenarios for the eukaryotic tree have been proposed . For instance , two important phylogenetic analyses that sampled wide eukaryotic diversity , support a deep branching position of diplomonad Giardia lamblia ( Bapteste et al . , 2002 ; Morrison et al . , 2007 ) . One of those analyses also sampled trichomonad species Trichomonas vaginalis , and showed it to be monophyletic with the early - branching Giardia ( Morrison et al . , 2007 ) . Trichomonas vaginalis and Giardia lamblia are anaerobes without canonical mitochondria , and have been proposed to be part of a monophyletic group called the Metamonada ( Hampl et al . , 2009 ) . These data may thus be interpreted to mean that the root of the eukaryotes lies between the early - branching metamonads and the other eukaryotic lineages ( Figure 1 . 1b ) . This hypothesis has been referred to as 36 Chapter 1 ' Metamonada first ' ( for instance in Wickstead et al . , 2010 ) . However , a concern for this rooting is that the early - branching position of metamonads may be due to long branch attraction , as was proposed for other candidate ' archezoans ' ( Embley & Hirt , 1998 ; Philippe et al . , 2000 ) . Yet another hypothesis , places the root of the eukaryotic tree between Euglenozoa and all other eukaryotes ( Cavalier - Smith , 2010 ) . This is mainly inspired by some primitive characteristics of Euglenozoa , namely the bacteria - like absence of mitochondrial outer - membrane channel Tom40 and DNA replication origin - recognition complexes ( Cavalier - Smith , 2010 ) ( Figure 1 . 1c ) . The consensus eukaryotic tree , used as a phylogenetic framework for the studies presented in this thesis , makes no assumption on the root of the tree and is therefore depicted as a polytomy of four major eukaryote lineages : unikonts , Archaeplastida , excavates and a large group comprising alveolates , heterokonts , Rhizaria and haptophytes ( Figure 1 . 1d ) . In addition , no assumption is made on contentious evolutionary relationships between the alveolates / heterokonts monophyletic group , Rhizaria and haptophytes . The excavates are depicted as a monophyletic group comprising metamonads and discicristates ( Figure 1 . 1d ) . Having outlined the taxonomic diversity and the consensus phylogeny of the eukaryotes , which will be used as framework for the evolutionary study presented in this thesis , the next step is to identify and describe the diversity of endocytic systems that have hitherto been investigated to significant molecular detail . In the next section , 37 Chapter 1 38 Figure 1 . 3 Alternative hypotheses for rooting the eukaryotic tree of life . The three schematic trees in black boxes represent alternative rooting hypotheses . a . Analysis of shared derived characters , such as gene fusions , suggests the root may be between unikonts and ' bikonts ' . b . Some multi - gene phylogenetic analyses still place Giardia and Trichomonas at an early - branching position in the eukaryotic tree of life , suggesting the root is between metamonads and the rest of the eukaryotes . c . Euglenozoa have also been proposed as the early - branching eukaryote lineage , suggesting the root is between Euglenozoa and rest of the eukaryotes . d . The schematic tree in the red box is the consensus eukaryotic tree used in this thesis as phylogenetic framework , and does not make assumptions on the rooting of the tree . The tree is depicted as a polytomy of unikonts , Archaeplastida , excavates ( metamonads + discicristates ) and a clade comprising heterokonts , alveolates , haptophytes and Rhizaria . Monophyly of unikonts , of the alveolates + heterokonts group , and of excavates ( metamonads + discicristates ) is assumed . Chapter 1 different pathways and endocytic mechanisms will be briefly described , in light of relevant cell biological evidence . 1 . 3 Endocytosis comprises multiple distinct pathways The cell has evolved several distinct processes to perform endocytosis ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . These are taxonomically defined by at least three factors : a ) the nature of the internalised cargo , b ) the level of cargo selectivity enforced by the endocytic apparatus , and c ) the key molecular effectors responsible for carrying out the process . Most definitions given by cell biology text books follow at least one of these three criteria , though not always consistently . While a comprehensive and satisfactory classification system for endocytosis does not exist , we broadly outline here known types and their key differences . 1 . 3 . 1 Phagocytosis Phagocytosis is the first endocytic process to be reported and studied extensively ( Metchnikoff , 1883 ) . It broadly refers to the engulfing of relatively large particles - larger than 0 . 5μm and up to ca . 8μm ( Simon & Schmid - Schonbein , 1988 ) - via the local rearrangement of the actin microfilament cytoskeleton . It has been studied extensively in metazoan model organisms in relation to its role in the immune response ( Ezekowitz et al . , 1991 ; Greenberg & Grinstein , 2002 ) , and in protists such as Tetrahymena ( Jacobs et al . , 2006 ) , Acanthamoeba ( Chambers & Thompson , 1976 ) and Dictyostelium ( Waddell & Vogel , 1985 ) , where it allows nutrient uptake via phagocytic predation . In metazoan immune systems , phagocytosis is performed by specialised cells such as 39 Chapter 1 neutrophils , monocytes and macrophages . These are known as ' professional ' phagocytes to distinguish them from less specialised ' non - professional ' cell types that perform phagocytosis ( for instance , fibroblasts and epithelial cells ) ( Rabinovitch , 1995 ) . The first step in the phagocytic pathway is opsonisation , whereby the particle is bound with either antibodies or specific recognition molecules called complement ( Bennett et al . , 1963 ) . Phagocytes then interact with the opsonised particle via either Fc receptors ( FcR ) which bind to the particle - bound antibodies ; or complement receptors ( CR ) , which interact with the particle via specific complement fragments ( Chimini & Chavrier , 2000 ) The phagocytic mechanism differs depending on the type of receptor . In FcR - mediated phagocytosis , the particle is surrounded by thin plasma membrane extensions called pseudopodia while the receptors bind to the antibodies attached to the antigen . As the particle is engulfed , the pseudopodia join and fuse around it , forming the early phagosome ( Uher et al . , 1981 ) . In contrast , particles opsonised with complement fragment are internalised directly into the cytoplasm without the extension of 40 Figure 1 . 2 Endocytosis comprises mechanistically distinct pathways . Endocytosis is traditionally divided in phagocytosis ( cell eating ) and pinocytosis ( cell drinking ) . However , within pinocytosis , diverse pathways with mechanistically distinct internalisation processes have been identified . These differ in vesicle size , vesicle coat composition , regulatory system , and function . ( Taken from ( Conner & Schmid , 2003 ) Chapter 1 pseudopodia ( May & Machesky , 2001 ; Newman et al . , 1991 ) . Phagocytosis is not functionally restricted to the immune system . In metazoan cells , for example , it is employed in the clearing of apoptotic cells which is important in tissue development and tissue homeostasis ( Finnemann & Rodriguez - Boulan , 1999 ; Reddien & Horvitz , 2000 ) . Apoptotic cells can be engulfed by ' non - professional ' neighbouring cells as well as ' professional ' phagocytes . The latter are summoned via chemotactic factors released by the apoptotic cells ( Lauber et al . , 2003 ) , and interact with signals such as phosphatidylserine , a phospholipid normally only present in the inside layer of the plasma membrane ( Fadok et al . , 2000 ) . The inflammatory response , normally linked with phagocytic intervention in the immune system is then actively suppressed ( Fadok et al . , 1998 ; Meagher et al . , 1992 ) . In protists , phagocytosis is known principally as a means of nutrient uptake by predation of other cells ( Chambers & Thompson , 1976 ; Vogel et al . , 1980 ; Waddell & Vogel , 1985 ) . Studies on Tetrahymena have highlighted a phagotrophic digestive system : particles are internalised via a cell surface structure called cytostome , the content of the phagosome is digested in highly acidic environments , finally the phagosomes fuse with the cytoproct - a cell surface structure at the posterior end of the cell - and the residual contents are released ( Allen & Wolf , 1979 ; Kitajima & Thompson , 1977 ) . While the function and pathway of phagocytosis in Tetrahymena and in metazoan phagocyte are distinct , around 40 % of the Tetrahymena phagosome proteome is shared ( Jacobs et al . , 2006 ) suggesting fundamental similarities and a common origin . Indeed , the adaptation of phagocytosis as a function of the immune 41 Chapter 1 system likely occurred long before metazoan diversification , as specialised cell types within the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum , appear to provide immune - like functions by engulfing bacteria and sequestering toxins while navigating the organism ( Chen et al . , 2007 ) . 1 . 3 . 2 Pinocytosis Pinocytosis refers to uptake of fluid - phase medium and macromolecules . It includes all endocytic pathways that do not involve the engulfment of large particles and the formation of a phagosome . Within this broad category several distinct pathways have been studied . These differ in molecular mechanisms , recognition systems and size of the vesicle carrier . 1 . 3 . 2 . 1 Macropinocytosis Macropinocytosis is dependent on cell surface ruffling . Ruffles are cytoplasm extensions formed by linear bands of outwardly polymerised actin filaments . Following appropriate stimuli the ruffles fold back on the plasma membrane forming a large vacuole called macropinosome ( Swanson , 1989 ) . This has been observed in mammalian cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells ( Alpuche - Aranda et al . , 1994 ; Racoosin & Swanson , 1992 ; Sallusto et al . , 1995 ) , but also in Dictyostelium ( Hacker et al . , 1997 ) . The macropinosomes have neither vesicle coats , nor a concentration of receptors ( Racoosin & Swanson , 1992 ) which suggests the process for internalisation of extra - cellular macromolecule is non - selective . However , there is evidence for regulation of macropinocytosis at different stages of its pathway . Cell surface ruffling can be stimulated by growth factor tyrosine kinase , phorbol esters and GTPase Rac1 ( Bar - Sagi 42 Chapter 1 & Feramisco , 1986 ; Ridley et al . , 1992 ; Swanson , 1989 ) . In addition , the maturation of macropinosomes is dependent on regulatory factors such as the GTPase Rab7 and lysosomal - membrane protein Lgp - 1 , which allow them to fuse with other endosomal and lysosomal vacuoles ( Racoosin & Swanson , 1993 ) . Interestingly , in phagocytes , macropinosome maturation is similar to phagosome maturation ( Desjardins et al . , 1994 ) , whereas in other cell types macropinosomes are recycled back to the cell surface after their first stage of maturation ( Hewlett et al . , 1994 ) . 1 . 3 . 2 . 2 Caveolin - mediated endocytosis Caveolin - mediated endocytosis belongs to a class of endocytic pathways characterised by the formation of molecular coats around vesicles , which confer consistency in vesicle size . One such pathway is mediated by flask - shaped plasma membrane invaginations called caveolae . These are very consistent in size ( 60 - 80 nm in diameter ) and feature a striated coat formed by parallel ~ 10 nm thick filaments ( Somlyo et al . , 1971 ; Stan , 2005 ) . The protein caveolin is the main structural component of these plasma membrane pits . It forms dimers that bind cholesterol , inserted as a loop into the inner layer of the plasma membrane , and assembled with other caveolin dimers to create the striated coat ( Murata et al . , 1995 ) . The internalisation of caveolae involves a complex signalling system which involves tyrosine - phosphorylation of its components ( Shajahan et al . , 2004 ) . For instance , in endothelial cells serum albumin binds to the gp60 caveolae receptor which in turn activates the downstream G protein coupled Src kinase signalling pathway ( Minshall et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , it has been shown that an increase in levels of cholesterol or treatment with synthetic glycosphingolipids stimulates caveolar endocytosis in a src kinase dependent way ( Sharma et al . , 2004 ) . 43 Chapter 1 Studies on the SV40 virus ' s exploitation of caveolae as way of entry into host cells has also shed light on the importance of actin cytoskeleton dynamics for caveolar endocytosis . Recruitment of actin patches is necessary as structural support of the preparatory stages of caveolae formation , andactin polymerisation is also required for internalisation of the caveolae into the cytosol ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Thomsen et al . , 2002 ) . Once internalised , the caveolae maintain structural stability until they fuse with an intermediate vacuole called the caveosome which in turn may fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum . The caveolar unit is then recycled back to the plasma membrane while maintaining its caveolin - cholesterol association ( Pelkmans et al . , 2004 ) . Caveolae have been studied extensively in mammalian cell types such as endothelial , epithelial and muscle cells but there is still debate regarding their function ( Parton & Simons , 2007 ) . Interestingly , the knock - out of the gene encoding caveolin - 1 in mice caused the impairment of nitric oxide and calcium signalling in the cardiovascular system , but did not affect transport and transcytosis of cholesterol or serum albumin as expected ( Drab et al . , 2001 ) . This suggests that caveolae and the associated endocytic system may be responsible for diverse cell signalling pathways . In addition , it has been suggested that caveolae play a role in storing and regulating the concentration of lipids in certain cell type plasma membranes . This is based on the extreme abundance of caveolae in adipocytes , and on data indicating that caveolin - 1 overexpression facilitates uptakes of fatty acids and affects levels of free cholesterol , while caveolin - 1 truncation mutant cells are affected by an imbalance of cholesterol and other lipid concentrations ( Meshulam et al . , 2006 ; Pol et al . , 2001 ; Pol et al . , 2004 ) . 44 Chapter 1 1 . 3 . 2 . 3 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a type of receptor mediated pinocytosis characterised by the coating of plasma membrane pits with polymeric clathrin assemblies ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) . Clathrin monomers are recruited to plasma membrane regions rich in phosphoinositides by adaptor proteins which also bind cargo internalisation signals ( Gaidarov & Keen , 1999 ) . Several different adaptor proteins have been identified and are known to bind a diverse set of internalisation signals of cargo molecules and endocytic receptors ( Traub , 2003 ) . In addition , adaptor proteins like the AP2 complex interact with accessory proteins which mediate clathrin pit invagination , interaction with the actin cytoskeleton , vesicle scission and provide molecular scaffolding to coordinate the process ( Maldonado - Baez & Wendland , 2006 ) . Following the internalisation of the vesicle , the clathrin coat is disassembled by hydrolysing the phosphoinositide components , and the clathrin monomers are recycled back to the plasma membrane while the vesicle fuses with endosomes or lysosomes ( Lemmon , 2001 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis has been studied mainly in mammalian and budding yeast model organisms but it is of particular interest to neurobiologists because it is the prevalent pathway for the recycling of synaptic components during chemical signalling ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ) . This has led to an effort to define the CME proteome using different approaches such as organelle - based proteomics ( Blondeau et al . , 2004 ; McPherson & Ritter , 2005 ) , structural studies ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ; Shih et al . , 1995 ) and biochemical protein interactions studies ( Gaidarov & Keen , 1999 ; Hinshaw & Schmid , 1995 ) . The resulting collection of data elucidates the molecular mechanisms behind the 45 Chapter 1 functional stages of CME from clathrin recruitment and pit formation to vesicle scission and coat recycling . Different functional sub - modules are mediated and coordinated by a network of protein - protein and protein - phospholipid interactions which together can be described as the CME interactome ( Lafer , 2002 ; Schmid & McMahon , 2007 ) . For an in - depth review of the CME interactome , and definition of this process into functional modules , see Chapter 3 . 1 . 3 . 2 . 4 Clathrin - independent endocytosis In addition to the pinocytosis pathways listed so far , a number of potentially distinct endocytic pathways have been documented . In the literature these are referred as clathrin - independent endocytosis because the clathrin coated vesicle is the most extensively studied endocytic carrier and is universally present in all cell types and lineages sampled . However , within this broad category a more refined understanding of the pathways ' characteristics is emerging . A number of important ligand and receptor molecules are reported to be internalised in a clathrin - independent manner . For instance , major histocompatibility class I ( MHCI ) and the interleukin 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) are endocytosed following an alternative route ( Neefjes et al . , 1990 ; Subtil et al . , 1994 ) . They are both associated with a membrane trafficking pathway regulated by GTP - binding protein ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( ARF6 ) ( Radhakrishna & Donaldson , 1997 ) . Experiments on HeLa cells showed ARF6 to be distributed to the tubular membrane compartments where IL - 2R alpha subunit ( tac ) and MHCI ( Radhakrishna & Donaldson , 1997 ) co - localised . The formation of membrane tubules is induced by EHDI ( homologue of CME regulator ) and regulated by 46 Chapter 1 nucleotide cycling on ARF6 and microtubules ( Caplan et al . , 2002 ) . Internalisation of the tubular endosomes was confirmed to be independent from that of clathrin - coated vesicles , however , clathrin vesicles and ARF6 regulated tubular endosomes converge and fuse with early endosome ( Naslavsky et al . , 2003 ) , suggesting distinct ways of entry into the cell may then follow the same trafficking and recycling route . Research into the uptake of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) has highlighted another distinct pinocytic pathway regulated by small GTPase cdc42 ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . This endocytic mechanism relies on the organisation of plasma membrane microdomains - known as lipid rafts - rich in cholesterol , sphingolipids and GPI - APs ( Lakhan et al . , 2009 ; Varma & Mayor , 1998 ) . Experiments on CHO and Cos - 7 cells have shown that GPI - APs are internalised in a clathrin and caveolin independent manner , forming distinct GPI - AP enriched early endosomal compartments ( GEEC ) , and fusing with the recycling endosomal compartment ( RE ) ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . A study on the cholera toxin subunit ( CTB ) entry strategy into target cells has revealed a shared endocytic pathway with GPI - APs and identified GEEC as an uncoated tubular and ring - shaped structure ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . A further distinct endocytic pathway may be the one mediated by flotillin proteins . Initially it was found that in mice with caveolin - 1 knock out and loss of most of caveolin - 2 expression , there were residual caveolae - like invaginations in endothelial cells that were slightly larger than typical caveolae ( Drab et al . , 2001 ; Zhao et al . , 2002 ) . Flotillin - 1 and flotillin - 2 , proteins with a similar topology to caveolin - 1 , were found to be concentrated in areas of the plasma membrane which were budding into the 47 Chapter 1 cell but were distinct from both clathrin pits and caveolin - 1 positive caveolae ( Frick et al . , 2007 ; Glebov et al . , 2006 ) , and coassembly of the two proteins was found to induce membrane curvature and formation of invaginations morphologically similar to caveolae ( Frick et al . , 2007 ) . However , expression of the two flotillins in caveolin - 1 knock - out mice fibroblasts did not seem to result in an increase of caveolar structures , but rather caused an increase in tubular structures similar to the clathrin - independent endocytic carriers known to mediate the cdc42 - regulated clathrin - independent pathway ( Kirkham et al . , 2008 ) . A link between flotillins and this pathway is also supported by the fact that loss of flotillin - 1 expression causes a reduction in the uptake of the GPI - AP CD59 ( Frick et al . , 2007 ; Glebov et al . , 2006 ) . With regards to the regulation of flotillin - mediated endocytosis , it has been reported that flotillins are endocytosed as a response to the expression of Fyn kinase , and that loss of function of the kinase impairs the internalisation of flotillin microdomains ( Riento et al . , 2009 ) . 1 . 3 . 2 . 5 Evolution of pinocytic diversity and functional overlaps amongst distinct pathways Having briefly described the remarkable diversity of pinocytic systems , it is important to consider how different pathways relate to each other , especially in light of the evolution of the eukaryote cell . Why did distinct endocytic systems evolve ? What is the functional overlap among different systems , and how flexible and adaptable are the endocytic effectors that seem to be specific to a particular system ? Considering its involvement in numerous vital cell functions , pinocytosis should be regarded as essential for every eukaryotic cell . However , there is a question whether any pinocytic pathway alone is necessary and sufficient for all endocytic functions required by the 48 Chapter 1 cell . This is due to the presence of multiple pathways in the majority of model organisms studied and by the fact that impairment of a specific pinocytic pathway in most experiments is not lethal . For instance , CME is the most conserved pathway studied ( Field et al . , 2007 ) and it is thought to be essential for constitutive nutrient uptake , membrane component recycling , cellular homoeostasis and signalling in eukaryotic cells ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ; Conner & Schmid , 2003 ; Di Fiore & De Camilli , 2001 ) . However , it has been demonstrated that in yeast and mammals cell types suppressing the expression of clathrin does not result in lethality ( Neumann - Staubitz et al . , 2010 ) . For instance , absence of clathrin expression in a mammalian cell line , while substantially inhibiting endocytosis , did not have a noticeable effect on lysosome composition and cells were viable ( Wettey et al . , 2002 ) . Likewise , massive depletion or full knock - down of clathrin by small interference RNA in HeLa cells , also resulted in severe disruptions of endocytosis of specific receptors , but did not result in cell death ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2003 ; Huang et al . , 2004 ; Motley et al . , 2003 ) . Also , in budding yeast cells , clathrin deletion mutants are substantially affected in their growth rate but normally survive , bar the deletion of clathrin deficiency suppressor Scd1 ( Lemmon & Jones , 1987 ; Payne & Schekman , 1985 ) . The main notable exception to this trend is Trypanosoma brucei , which has been shown to necessitate expression of clathrin in both bloodstream and procyclic stages to be viable ( Allen et al . , 2003 ) . This finding is significant because it suggests that while clathrin is ancient and important to distantly related protists , for instance Trypanosoma , Giardia ( Hernandez et al . , 2007 ) , and Paramecium ( Wiejak et al . , 2004 ) , clathrin - independent pathways only evolved in higher eukaryotes such Metazoa and Fungi . This could be the result of an increased necessity for regulatory flexibility of the endocytic systems , as multicellularity led to 49 Chapter 1 cell specialisation and required a higher level of signalling coordination . It may also be associated with increase of functional demands of the cell . Clathrin - independent endocytic pathways for instance have been linked with functions like plasma membrane repair , cellular polarisation and cell spreading ( Gauthier et al . , 2009 ; Grande - Garcia et al . , 2007 ; Idone et al . , 2008 ) . There is also the question of how distinct the pathways described truly are . While initially clathrin - independent pathways were only theorised as a necessary alternative route for the internalisation of molecules in the absence of clathrin , there is now more substantial evidence with regards to unique features of these pathways such as the morphology of the carriers and regulatory systems . These were summarised in the previous section . Nonetheless , there are examples of functional overlaps among different pinocytic pathways , whereby a specific function is mediated by the same protein in different pathways . For instance , recruitment of dynamin is required in caveolin - mediated endocytosis ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Shajahan et al . , 2004 ) , suggesting a similar vesicle budding mechanism to CME . However , evidence indicates that dynamin is not required for macropinocytosis , nor for the clathrin - independent endocytic pathways regulated by Arf6 or Cdc42 ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ; Naslavsky et al . , 2003 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . The putative flotillin - mediated endocytic pathway does not seem to require dynamin either ( Glebov et al . , 2006 ) . The SNX9 protein is also involved in more than one pathway , with evidence showing that it coordinates actin dynamics in CME , macropinocytosis , and Cdc42 regulated clathrin - independent pathways ( Wang et al . , 2010 ; Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . Remarkably , AP2 has been shown to play a role in the clathrin - independent endocytic pathway regulated by Arf6 , though 50 Chapter 1 only in a post - endocytic trafficking capacity ( Lau & Chou , 2008 ) . 1 . 3 . 3 Spatial regulation of endocytosis So far we have described endocytic pathways according to its regulators , molecular mechanisms , carrier structure and interaction with the endomembrane system . A further aspect is the organisation and spatial distribution of the sites of endocytosis on the plasma membrane . What regulates this spatial distribution of endocytosis and how ? Some protists have specialised membrane micro - domains and structures dedicated to endocytosis . Kinetoplastida for instance feature a small invagination at the base of the flagellum known as the flagellar pocket ( Morgan et al . , 2002 ) . This cell surface compartment - composed by several structural subdomains and with a distinct membrane proteome - is where all endocytosis and exocytosis activity takes place ( Field & Carrington , 2009 ) . In addition , protists such as Trypanosoma cruzi , Tetrahymena and Paramecium , feature an oral apparatus formed by a specialised funnel - like membrane invagination ( Gonda et al . , 2000 ; Plattner & Kissmehl , 2003 ; Porto - Carreiro et al . , 2000 ) . The apparatus consists of a cytostome where food is collected by ciliary motility , and a cytopharynx where vacuoles are formed and internalised into the cytoplasm ( Cunha - e - Silva et al . , 2010 ; Gonda et al . , 2000 ) . 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 Eisosomes Specialised endocytic structures have not been reported in opisthokonts and the consensus is that besides the presence of microdomains with higher endocytic activity there is limited differentiation of the plasma membrane ( Field et al . , 2006 ) . The only 51 Chapter 1 known exceptions are polarised cells such as epithelial cells of mammals , or hyphae in filamentous fungi , where endocytosis occurs in distinct cell surface domains ( Fuchs et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ) . This raises the question of what coordinates the spatial distribution of sites of endocytosis in undifferentiated plasma membranes . A cell surface protein complex called the eisosome has been identified as a candidate endocytic spatial coordinator ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . The main components of the eisosome are two paralagous cytoplasmic proteins , Pil1 and Lsp1 , which assemble in large quantities ( approximately 2 , 000 - 5 , 000 molecules of each paralogue per eisosome ) to create stable complexes at fixed sites across the plasma membrane ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , the transmembrane proteins Sur7 and Nce102 have been shown to accumulate at sites of eisosome formation ( Frohlich et al . , 2009 ; Walther et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that they are integral components of the complex , and potentially act as anchors of the cytoplasmic side of the eisosome to the plasma membrane . Cell imaging studies in yeast have shown that the internalisation sites of the membrane dye FM4 - 64 coincide with the sites where eisosomes assemble and that loss of Pil1 causes eisosome organisation to falter and aberrant membrane invaginations to form ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . It has also been reported that Pil1 and Lsp1 are part of a signalling pathway - regulated by sphingolipid components long chain bases ( LCB ) and protein kinases Pkh1 / 2 , Pkc1 and Ypk1 / 2 - which is involved in cell wall integrity and cell wall remodelling during growth ( Levin et al . , 1994 ; Luo et al . , 2008 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . Pkh1 / 2 control eisosome assembly and disassembly by phosphorylating Pil1 and Lsp1 and in turn Pil1 and Lsp1 negatively regulate pkh1 / 2 and its downstream kinase 52 Chapter 1 cascades ( Walther et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . Together , this evidence shows that eisosomes are involved in both endocytosis and cell surface integrity , and may therefore coordinate these two functions to provide a spatial organisation of endocytosis . However , the data on eisosomes comes from a taxonomically limited selection of model organisms , with representatives from only ascomycete fungi ( Alvarez et al . , 2008 ; Vangelatos et al . , 2010 ; Walther et al . , 2006 ) . Given the lack of experimental evidence from other major eukaryote phyla the significance of eisosomes within the evolution of eukaryote endocytic systems needs further testing . 1 . 4 Thesis aims In this introduction I have outlined a consensus eukaryote tree and defined endocytic diversity from the existing literature , which together forms the conceptual framework for the experimental work presented in this thesis . The overall aim of this research is to trace the diversity of endocytosis across the diversity of eukaryotes . This will help to predict the likely characteristics of the last common eukaryotic ancestor and investigate how the ancestral cell diversified . It is an important effort because the transition between prokaryote and eukaryotes is the most drastic evolutionarily leap in the history of life ( Cavalier - Smith , 2006 ) and yet it is still a poorly understood process ( Gribaldo et al . , 2010 ; Roger & Simpson , 2009 ) . The remarkable diversity of endocytic systems poses a problem for such research because each distinct system is complex and mediated by several protein effectors ( Conner & Schmid , 2003 ) , and bearing this in mind our knowledge of how certain types of endocytosis work is almost certainly incomplete . The sheer size of the collective 53 Chapter 1 endocytic proteome means that analysis of the entire system is beyond the remit of this PhD programme . On the other hand , selecting a watered - down selection of endocytic genes involved distinct pathways , with the idea to offer an average representation of endocytic systems , would defeat one of the primary objectives of this study which is to create a taxonomic map of endocytic diversity in eukaryotes . Such a map would help further characterise the endocytic abilities of the LCEA , as well as outline the diversification of ancestral pathways within the eukaryotic tree of life . The solution adopted here is to select clathrin - mediated endocytosis - one of the most prominent and better characterised endocytic pathway in the literature ( Conner & Schmid , 2003 ) - as a case study . Our prior knowledge that clathrin and the AP2 complex are at least as old as the last common ancestor of the sampled eukaryotes ( Field et al . , 2006 ) suggests that extending the study to include all of the CME interacting partners will tell us more about the state of the LCEA and how it diversified . More importantly , existing knowledge on the cellular mechanisms behind CME shows that the process occurs thanks to the integration of the specialised endocytic apparatus with the regulatory elements of the actin cytoskeleton and its associated motor proteins ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ; Schmid & McMahon , 2007 ) . This implies that by studying the evolution of the complete identified CME proteome , one can study : 1 ) the evolution of endocytosis 2 ) the evolution of actin cytoskeleton regulation and 3 ) the evolution of modular interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and CME . This approach reflects a view of the evolution of early eukaryotes , whereby features that were acquired in early eukaryotes , such as the nucleus , the endomembrane system , phagotrophy , sex and mitochondria , were linked in the way they emerged . Specifically , it has been proposed 54 Chapter 1 that the eukaryote cytoskeleton and the endomembrane system together enabled the evolution of phagotrophy ( Cavalier - Smith , 2009 ) . CME constitutes an ideal example of a link between the two cellular realms ( endomembrane system and cytoskeleton ) , and studying its origin and evolution may provide insight to this evolutionary perspective . Studying the eisosomes also offers possibilities to investigate the origin of regulatory and mechanistic interactions in endocytosis . As mentioned in section 1 . 3 . 3 , current evidence suggests the eisosome may mediate the recruitment of endocytic proteins to site of endocytosis , the spatial distribution of endocytosis across the plasma membrane , and the integrity of the cell wall during endocytosis ( Walther et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . This may be done by interacting with both endocytic proteins and the cytoskeleton or cytoskeletal regulators . The significance of eisosomes is therefore potentially two fold : on the one hand as markers of sites of endocytosis in eukaryotes , and on the other hand , as potential regulator of the interaction between the cytoskeleton and endocytosis . The thesis aims are therefore to specifically address the evolution of endocytosis - cytoskeleton interaction , which can be broken down into the following objectives : For the study on the evolution of CME the main objectives were to : - Outline the comprehensive network of interactions which enables CME in the model organisms in which it has been studied . - Determine the taxonomic distribution of the CME proteome across a broad selection of eukaryote diversity . 55 Chapter 1 - Reconstruct the evolution of CME by performing phylogenetic analyses of its protein effectors . - Reconstruct the evolution of CME and eisosomes by identifying synapomorphic , novel protein domain combination . - Construct likely models of CME at different stages of their evolution by identifying synapomorphic novel interactions between network components . For the study on the evolution of eisosomes the main objectives were to : - Determine the taxonomic distribution of the eisosome across a broad selection of eukaryote diversity . - Reconstruct the evolutionary history of eisosomes by performing phylogenetic analyses . - Investigate eisosome function and localisation in additional fungi with multicellularity and cellular differentiation by experimental cell biology . 56 Chapter 2 2 Materials and Methods 2 . 1 Bioinformatics 2 . 1 . 1 Genomic and proteomic data sampling The criterion for sampling genomes was to select well studied model organisms with existing advanced cell biological data , completely or near - completely sequenced genomes and predicted proteins databases . A total of 28 genomes were selected . They include 11 opisthokonts ( 6 metazoan , 4 fungi and 1 choanoflagellate ) , 2 ameobozoans , 4 Archaeplastida ( 1 land plant , 2 green algae and 1 red algae ) , 7 ' chromalveolates ' ( 2 ciliates , 2 apicomplexa , 1 diatom , 1 oomycete and 1 haptophyte ) and 4 excavates ( 2 Discicristata and 2 Metamonada ) . The full list of taxa and online access details is in Table 2 . 1 . In the comparative genomic study of eisosome associated gene families an additional 17 fungal complete genomes as listed in Table 2 . 2 . The Taxonomically Broad expressed sequence tags Database ( TBestDB ) which includes a broad selection of protists ( O ' Brien et al . , 2007 ) was searched via online access ( Table 2 . 3 ) . Finally , the EST database of chytridiomycete Blastocladiella emersonii , was searched via online access of the relevant genome project ( Ribichich et al . , 2005 ) ( Table 2 . 3 ) . 2 . 1 . 2 Sequence similarity searches by BLAST and PSI - BLAST To search for DNA and protein sequence similarity in the selected databases the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool was used ( BLAST ) ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) . Using a heuristic algorithm that approximates the Smith - Waterman algorithm ( Smith & Waterman , 1981 ) BLAST calculates a measure of similarity between variable sub - 57 Chapter 2 regions of the full length query and target sequences . This is done by searching for small query sequence sub - sections , known as words , in the target sequence , and evaluating the similarities between the neighbouring regions of the query and target sequences using a scoring matrix ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) . Alignments with a sufficiently high alignment scores , and sufficiently low Expect ( E ) - values ( probability that the similarity is by chance ) are listed in the output as candidate homologues . The BLAST algorithm is implemented in a series of programs designed to compare either a DNA or protein sequence against either a DNA or protein database . In homology searches carried out for this thesis BLASTp was used to compare protein query sequences against predicted protein databases . Because some genes are absent in predicted proteomes , tBLASTn , which compares a protein query sequence against a translated DNA database , was also used in homology searches . When testing the identity of an experimentally sequenced DNA clone , BLASTx , which translates a DNA query sequence and compares it to a protein database , was used . Finally , when searching the NCBI Trace Archives for highly similar sequences , BLASTn , which compares a DNA query sequence against a DNA database , was used . In all the BLAST searches carried out with amino acid sequences as search seeds , the word size used was 3 , the scoring matrix was BLOSUM62 ( Henikoff & Henikoff , 1992 ) , and the E - value threshold employed was 10 . Accession numbers of candidate homologous were recorded and its sequences downloaded in fasta format for further analysis . For the BLAST searches with nucleotide sequences as search seeds , the word size used was 11 , the scoring parameters were default ( match / mismatch = 5 / 2 ; for gap costs , existence = 5 , extension = 2 ) . 58 Chapter 2 Table 2 . 1 Predicted proteome and translated nucleotide databases of diverse eukaryotes used for phylogenomic studies in this thesis .

For the BLAST searches with nucleotide sequences as search seeds , the word size used was 11 , the scoring parameters were default ( match / mismatch = 5 / 2 ; for gap costs , existence = 5 , extension = 2 ) . To detect putative and highly divergent homologues , the Position - Specific Iterative 61 Chapter 2 ( PSI ) - BLAST program was used ( Altschul et al . , 1997 ) . PSI - BLAST works by first performing a normal BLASTp search , then using an alignment of the resulting high scoring hits to create a position specific scoring matrix ( PSSM ) , also known as profile , which assigns different scores across the alignment in relation to how conserved each position is ( Altschul et al . , 1997 ) . The PSSM is then used for a second search , where new candidate homologues can be identified and included in the profile . The process is repeated until the user is satisfied that all putative gene homologues have been identified or until repeat iterations do not recover additional sequences . The parameters used for PSI - BLAST are the same as the ones used for BLASTp . 2 . 1 . 3 Conserved protein domain analysis Sequence with similarity identified by BLAST were selected for further analysis . To annotated these candidate CME / eisosome proteins , I identified their protein domain structures using two methods . Firstly , protein sequences were searched against the Conserved Domain Database ( CDD ) ( Marchler - Bauer et al . , 2009 ) , which comprises more than 38 , 000 multiple sequence alignment models in the form of PSSMs ( version 2 . 26 ) . Reverse position specific ( RPS ) - BLAST is used to search the protein query against the PSSMs database , returning as output any hit below a given E - value threshold . In addition , CDD features a low - complexity filter which recognises compositionally biased regions within a given protein and discards them from the search . The E - value employed in CDD analysis was 0 . 1 and the low - complexity filter was used in the protein domain analysis presented in this thesis . The second method used to predict protein domains was a search of the PFAM database 62 Chapter 2 ( Bateman et al . , 2000 ) . PFAM is a collection of annotated protein families . Each protein family annotation consists of a seed multiple sequence alignment ( MSA ) composed of a selection of representative sequences , a full MSA featuring all protein family members detectable in the PFAMSEQ database ( composed of SWISS - PROT and SP - TREMBL , ( Bateman et al . , 2000 ) , and a profile hidden Markov model ( profile HMM ) . The profile HMM is a position specific scoring system , built from a MSA , which can be used to calculate the probability that a given protein belongs to the protein domain family ( Eddy , 1998 ) . In PFAM they are built from the seed MSA with the HMMER package which implements an augmented version of the basic HMM method ( Eddy , 1998 ) . Putatively homologous protein sequences were searched against the PFAM database ( current version 24 . 0 features 11 ' 912 protein families , ( Finn et al . , 2010 ) ) accessible online ( http : / / pfam . sanger . ac . uk / search ) . Any hit with an E - value below the 1 . 0 threshold was recorded as having putative protein domain homology . 2 . 1 . 4 Preparing data - sets for phylogenetic analysis 2 . 1 . 4 . 1 Renaming sequences FASTA files of protein sequences of interest were downloaded from the appropriate genome project online portal ( Tables 2 . 1 - 2 . 2 ) for phylogenetic analysis . The title lines of sequences in FASTA format typically feature a label with accession number and database details , and a comment section with functional annotation and species names . For the analyses in this thesis the title lines of FASTA sequences were edited to included only the accession number and an abbreviation of the species it was sequenced from . This was done with the REFGEN software ( Leonard et al . , 2009 ) which was accessed on its online portal ( http : / / projects . exeter . ac . uk / ceem / refgen . html ) . REFGEN renames 63 Chapter 2 any sequence from NCBI , JGI and Broad institute curated databases . For other databases formats , the title line of FASTA sequences was edited manually . 2 . 1 . 4 . 2 Multiple sequence alignment Multiple sequence alignments ( MSA ) of groups of homologous sequences retrieved from database searches were created with the MUSCLE ( multiple sequence comparison by log - expectation ) software ( Edgar , 2004b ) ( Edgar , 2004a ) . The MUSCLE algorithm is briefly summarised here in three main stages ( for mathematical definitions see Edgar 2004a and Edgar 2004b ) . Firstly a preliminary MSA is constructed . This entails creating a guide binary tree by clustering a k mer distance matrix with the UPGMA ( Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean ) and constructing the progressive alignment by following the branching order of the guide tree . In prefix order , each sequence is assigned a profile calculated with the novel log - expectation score ( Edgar , 2004b ) , and at each node a pair - wise alignment of the sequence profiles are constructed until a complete MSA is obtained . The second stage consists in re - estimating the guide tree using the Kimura distance ( Kimura , 1983 ) , which is more accurate than k mer distance but requires an alignment . As in the first stage the tree is constructed by clustering the distance matrix - in this case calculated with Kimura distance - with UPGMA and then producing a progressive alignment by following the tree ' s branching order . In the third stage the MSA goes through a process of refinement . The guide tree from the second stage is divided in two sub - trees by deleting an edge , a profile of the MSA in each subtree is calculated , and a new MSA is created by aligning the two profiles . The new MSA is kept if the sum of pairwise alignment score is improved and the process is repeated until convergence is reached . 64 Chapter 2 2 . 1 . 4 . 3 Masking multiple sequence alignments In most phylogenetic analyses evolutionary signal is improved by discarding gaps and highly variable regions from MSAs because they may constitute noise ( Castresana , 2000 ; Talavera & Castresana , 2007 ) . Gaps and regions of hyper - variability of the MSAs prepared for this thesis were removed manually . The MSAs analysed in the thesis varied greatly both in terms of length and degree of character conservation so no single set of suitable criteria for alignment masking could be found . Overall , as it is recommended by literature ( Castresana , 2000 ; Talavera & Castresana , 2007 ) , stringent criteria for conserved character selection were applied to long MSAs , whereas relaxed criteria for conserved character selection were applied to short MSAs . Alignment masking was carried out with the SEAVIEW software ( version 4 ; Gouy et al . , 2010 ) which allows to visualise the MSA with colour schemes highlighting different nucleotides or amino acid groups informative sub - sets of the alignment . Masked MSAs were exported in FASTA format for the phylogenetic inference . In those instances where MUSCLE partially misaligned some sequences the data sets were visualised with sequence editing software SE - AL ( Rambaut , 2007 ) and the misaligned sections of the MSA manually corrected . 2 . 1 . 5 Phylogenetic analysis 2 . 1 . 5 . 1 Evolutionary model selection Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were selected for phylogenetic analyses . To use these methods effectively , it is important to estimate the best - fitting evolutionary model . Informing the phylogenetic analysis with the optimal character substitution scoring system can significantly improve the resulting evolutionary model ( Keane et al . , 65 Chapter 2 2006 ) . In addition , rates of nucleotide substitution vary significantly across a gene ( Fitch & Margoliash , 1967 ) as different selective constraints apply across a gene in relation to the functional attributes of given sites . This variation can be partially represented by a gamma distribution , where the substitution rate is plotted against the proportion of the sites that demonstrate the substitution rate . The shape of the resulting curve is described as the α parameter ( Yang , 1996 ) . Another approach to correct for differential rate variation is by calculating and correcting for the proportion of invariable sites , because assuming that all sites can vary while some do not can result in model violation while assuming the remaining sites evolve at a constant rate ( Steel et al . , 2000 ) . The invariable model can be used in conjunction with the gamma model ( Gu et al . , 1995 ) . A further parameter used in evolutionary models is observed character frequencies , to correct for bias in amino - acid composition and the relative proportions of different character changes ( Abascal et al . , 2005 ) . The MODELGENERATOR software ( http : / / bioinf . may . ie / software / modelgenerator / ) was used to estimate the optimal evolutionary model for masked MSAs . The program works by constructing a series of neighbour - joining trees using a combination of differing model parameters and substitution matrices . The trees are used to compare evolutionary models . For each model analysis , the branch lengths and parameters are optimised using the PAL library ( Drummond & Strimmer , 2001 ) . For protein data , the models MODELGENERATOR supports are 1 of 10 substitution matrices either on their own , or in combination with gamma shape for among - site rate variation ( + G ) , proportion of invariable sites ( + I ) , observed amino acid frequencies ( + F ) , or any combination of the three parameters ( Keane et al . , 2006 ) . The current version supports 66 Chapter 2 96 different model combinations . To calculate the gamma shape value ( α ) , MODELGENERATOR approximates the distribution in discrete categories to reduce computational intensity . For all model searching analyses , 8 discrete categories were used to approximate the gamma distribution . MODELGENERATOR returns for each model combination a likelihood value ( i . e . the likelihood of observing the data given the evolutionary model ) . The model combination with the highest likelihood value was selected for phylogenetic analysis . 2 . 1 . 5 . 2 Fast maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference The maximum likelihood ( ML ) method calculates the likelihood that a hypothetical phylogenetic tree generated the observed molecular data . For every hypothetical phylogenetic tree , the algorithm calculates the likelihood of each amino - acid or nucleotide , at each site in the MSA , according to a specified evolutionary model . The likelihoods are calculated separately for each site , and are then added together to constitute the overall likelihood of the tree topology . The hypothetical phylogenetic tree that has the highest likelihood of generating the data is chosen as the best tree . The ML method can incorporate complicated evolutionary models . This gives it an advantage over simpler methods such as parsimony when analysing data with different rates of evolution among sites and among lineages ( J . Felsenstein , 1981 ) . However , it can be computationally very intensive , thus prohibitive for analyses with large numbers of sequences . To make ML analyses computationally viable , heuristic methods have been employed to create fast ML algorithms . These work via a stepwise optimisation of the tree ' s branch position and branch lengths until the likeliest tree can no longer be 67 Chapter 2 improved . For the analyses presented in the thesis , two fast ML methods were used : PHYML ( Guindon & Gascuel , 2003 ) and RAXML ( Stamatakis , 2006 ) . PHYML has the following algorithm . Firstly an initial tree is constructed from pairwise evolutionary distance matrix of the sequences with fast distance - based neighbour - joining method BIONJ ( Gascuel , 1997 ) . In the second stage , the likelihood of the initial tree is calculated . The tree is then refined by iterative simultaneous modification of tree topology and branch length . This is done by calculating all possible branch modifications , applying a proportion of these changes to the tree , and verifying whether the likelihood of said tree has improved . If the likelihood has not improved a smaller proportion of branch changes is applied . The process is repeated until the tree can no longer be improved ( Guindon & Gascuel , 2003 ) . PHYML can estimate and adjust evolutionary model parameters as the analysis is carried out , but can also be instructed with a specified evolutionary model including a substitution matrix , gamma distribution , and proportion of invariable sites ( Guindon & Gascuel 2003 ) . The RAXML algorithm works as follows . Firstly , the starting tree is calculated with the parsimony method DNAPARS ( from PHYLIP package ) . According the author , this provides a starting tree with better likelihood values in comparison with neighbour - joining or random method , making the optimisation stage quicker ( Stamatakis et al . , 2005 ) . Also , the parsimony tree is constructed with stepwise addition ( J . Felsenstein , 1981 ) which allows to construct distinct starting trees according to random seeds provided by the user . This in turn allows the optimisation analyses to run from several distinct starting parsimony trees , thereby reducing the chances of being stuck on a local 68 Chapter 2 optima in the tree search space ( Stamatakis et al . , 2005 ) . The RAXML tree optimisation stage is based on FASTDNAML ( Olsen et al . , 1994 ) but features unique algorithm steps designed to ease the computational complexity of the search . Firstly , in a subtree rearrangement step , the RAXML algorithm only optimises the length of the three local branches adjacent to the insertion site , storing the 20 trees with best likelihood for global branch length optimisation at the end of the rearrangement step . Secondly , as the initial optimisation stage proceeds , if a subtree rearrangement produces a topology with higher likelihood , instead of completing the entire rearrangement step that topology is immediately selected as current tree and further improvements are applied to that tree ( Stamatakis et al . , 2005 ) . RAXML also can be instructed with a specified substitution matrix , gamma distribution and proportion of invariable sites . The program is hard coded to correct for among - site rate variation with 4 discrete categories of evolution rate . 2 . 1 . 5 . 3 Bootstrap analysis To estimate confidence levels in the phylogenies inferred with fast ML methods the bootstrap statistical approach was used . In short , bootstrap consists in creating pseudo - replicate data sets by randomly and independently sampling data points ( represented in a MSA data set as a character column ) with replacement , from a MSA , until a data set of the same size as the MSA is obtained . Each pseudo - replicate data set is then analysed with the same phylogenetic method as the original analysis . The resulting set of bootstraps derived trees provide a measure of the statistical variance of the original data set ( Joseph Felsenstein , 1985 ) . Confidence levels can be applied as a percentage to a given clade in the phylogenetic tree , where the percentage represents the frequency of 69 Chapter 2 the clade in the bootstrap replicate analyses . 60 % is considered here as the minimum value to present a clade as credibly monophyletic , and 90 % is considered here the minimum value to present a clade as monophyletic with robust statistical support . Both PHYML and RAXML incorporate bootstrap analysis . In the analyses presented here , a minimum of 100 bootstrap ML repetitions were performed for data sets with 100 or less sequences and a minimum of 1000 bootstraps ML repetitions were performed for data sets with more than 100 sequences . 2 . 1 . 5 . 4 Bayesian phylogenetic analysis In addition to ML methods a Bayesian approach to phylogenetic reconstruction was used . The Bayesian approach consists in calculating a posterior probability for a given tree by combining the prior probability of the tree with the likelihood of observing the molecular data given the tree ( Huelsenbeck et al . , 2001 ) . This approach is implemented with the Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithm which allows an approximation of the posterior probability distribution . MCMC perturbs a current tree by changing tree topology parameters such as branch position and branch length , and / or evolutionary model parameters such as gamma distribution or proportion of invariable sites , if implemented . The probability of the new tree is then evaluated with Metropolis - Hastings probability ( Larget & Simon , 1999 ) . If the new tree is an improvement it is accepted as current tree state which will be subjected to further perturbations and evaluation cycles ( Huelsenbeck et al . , 2001 ) . The process continues for a pre - determined number of times deemed sufficient to obtain an adequate sample of the posterior distribution of tree topologies , with the program sampling trees at pre - determined intervals . A concern for the Bayesian method is that the heuristic tree 70 Chapter 2 searching process may miss areas of tree space with high likelihood values . Metropolis Coupling ( MC ) , an MCMC convergence acceleration technique , is used in phylogenetic Bayesian implementations to reduce the chances of this happening ( Huelsenbeck et al . , 2001 ) . MC consists in running X number of MCMC chains , where X minus 1 chains are ' heated ' i . e . designed to perturb current trees to a greater or lesser extent ( depending on the ' heat ' parameter ) , so that distant peaks in the tree distribution space may be explored . The Bayesian method allows to sample a statistically significant number of trees from the probability optima , by discarding trees with sub - optimal likelihood values from the analysis . A consensus final tree is derived from the sampled trees , with posterior probability values represented by the frequencies of each monophyletic clade in the tree set . In the analyses presented here , Bayesian analysis was performed with MRBAYES 3 . 1 . 2 ( Ronquist & Huelsenbeck , 2003 ) . 2 . 2 Molecular biology 2 . 2 . 1 Laboratory methods All work in the molecular biology laboratory was conducted according to aseptic technique to minimise chances of contamination . Protocol procedures involving the handling of Magnaporthe oryzae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures were all conducted in a class II laminar flow cabinet . All flasks , glass bottles , pipette tips , 1 . 5 ml microcentrifuge tubes ( Eppendorf ) , Oakridge tubes ( Nalgene ) , Falcon conical tubes ( Becton Dickinson biosciences ) , Miracloth ( Calbiochem ) , Pestle and mortars , commercial blenders ( Waring ) , bacterial and fungal growth media was sterilised by autoclaving for 15 minutes at 121 ºC . All chemicals were ordered from Sigma unless stated otherwise . Powder free nitril gloves were used in the handling of all equipment 71 Chapter 2 used for the experiments . Table 1 in Appendix 1 includes full list of laboratory products suppliers and respective addresses . 2 . 2 . 2 Growth and maintenance of fungal stocks The Guy - 11 Magnaporthe oryzae ( M . oryzae ) strain was obtained from Prof . Nick J . Talbot ' s laboratory ( Biosciences , College of Life and Environmental Sciences , University of Exeter , UK ) . The strain was grown on complete media ( CM ) ( Talbot et al . , 1993 ) . CM is 1 % ( w / v ) dextrose , 0 . 2 % peptone , 0 . 1 % yeast extract , 0 . 1 % trace elements , 0 . 1 % vitamin supplement ( 0 . 001 g L - 1 biotin , 0 . 001 g L - 1 pyridoxine , 0 . 001 g L - 1 thiamine , 0 . 001 g L - 1 riboflavin , 0 . 001 g L - 1 p - aminobenzoic acid , 0 . 001 g L - 1 nicotinic acid ) , 0 . 6 % NaNO 3 , 0 . 05 % KCl , 0 . 05 % MgSO 4 , 0 . 15 % KH 2 PO 4 ( pH to 6 . 5 ) , and 1 . 5 % agar . The strain was incubated on CM agar plates in steady conditions of 26 ºC room temperature and 12 hour light and dark cycles . To create long - term stocks , M . oryzae was grown through filter paper disks ( 3 mm , Whatman International ) , which were then desiccated and kept at - 20 ºC . Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were obtained from Dr . Tobias Walther laboratory ( Organelle Architecture and Dynamics , Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , Germany ) . They are all in the W303 genetic background ( ura3 - 52 ; trp1Δ 2 ; leu2 - 3 , 112 ; his3 - 11 ; ade2 - 1 ; can1 - 100 ) ( Baudin - Baillieu et al . , 1997 ) . The strains used are wild type and pil1 Δ ( pil1 Δ : : KAN , mating type a and α ) . The S . cerevisiae strains were grown on yeast extract ( 1 % ) , peptone ( 2 % ) , and dextrose ( 2 % ) media ( YPD ) with the addition of 2 % agar for plates . For growth , the cultures were incubated at 30 ºC for 2 days . For short term storage the yeast strains were kept in YPD agar plates at temperatures of 2 - 8 72 Chapter 2 ºC for up to 30 days . For long - term storage , individual yeast colonies were resuspended in 500 μl of liquid YPD media , mixed with 500 μl of 50 % glycerol and kept at - 80 ºC . 2 . 2 . 3 Nucleic acid analysis 2 . 2 . 3 . 1 DNA extraction Total M . oryzae genomic DNA was extracted with the following method . A M . oryzae liquid culture was prepared by inoculating 200 ml of liquid CM ( normal CM recipe but without agar ) with a ~ 2 cm 2 sized mycelium sample recovered from an agar plate , and blending it in a sterile commercial blender ( Waring ) . The resulting inoculated culture was grown in a sterile flask at 24°C for 48 hours with shaking ( 150 rpm ) . The mycelium from the liquid culture was collected by filtration through sterile Miracloth ( Calbiochem ) in a class II laminar flow cabinet . It was then wrapped in an aluminium foil parcel and placed in liquid nitrogen for ~ 10 seconds to freeze dry it . Subsequently the mycelium was placed in a mortar and ground to a fine powder which was then added to a sterile Oakridge tube containing 4 ml of 2 X CTAB . 2 X CTAB buffer is 0 . 0055 M Hexadecyltrimenthylammonium bromide ( CTAB ) , 0 . 1 M Tris ( hydroxymethyl ) amino - methane ( Tris ) , 0 . 0078 M Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) and 0 . 7 NaCl . The tube was shaken and incubated in 65 ºC water bath for 20 minutes . An equal volume of chloroform : pentanol ( 24 : 1 ) was added and the tube shaken for 20 minutes at room temperature . The sample was then centrifuged at 14 , 000 x g for 10 minutes in a Beckman J2 - MC high speed centrifuge . The resulting supernatant was transferred to another Oakridge tube with an equal amount of chloroform : pentanol and the centrifugation step repeated . The supernatant was transferred to a new Oakridge tube , and an equal volume of isopropanol was added to precipitate the nucleic acids . After 73 Chapter 2 five minutes of incubation on ice the solution was centrifuged at 15 , 700 x g for 10 minutes . The resulting pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of TE ( 10 mM Tris , 1 mM EDTA [ pH 8 ] ) and then reprecipitated by adding 0 . 1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 2 ) and two volumes of 95 % ethanol and incubating at - 20 ºC for 10 minutes . The solution was transferred to a 1 . 5 ml centrifuge tube and the DNA collected by centrifuging for 20 minutes at 17 , 000 x g . The resulting pellet was washed with 500 μl of 70 % ethanol , dried for 20 minutes and finally resuspended in 25 - 100 μl nuclease free H 2 O with 10μg ml - 1 of RNase A . The total genomic DNA sample was stored at - 20 ºC . 2 . 2 . 3 . 2 RNA extraction To minimise chances of RNase contamination , all equipment , surfaces and gloves were thoroughly cleaned with 70 % ethanol and with RNase Decontamination Solution RNaseZap ( Ambion ) prior to carrying out RNA extraction and analysis . Only nuclease free 1 . 5 ml centrifuge tubes and filter pipette tips were utilised to avoid RNA degradation . Only Diethyl pyrocarbonate ( DEPC ) treated water ( Invitrogen ) or nuclease free water ( Promega ) was utilised in RNA related protocols . 2 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 1 Extraction of M . oryzae total RNA The RNA extraction protocol used for M . oryzae entails the preparation of an extraction buffer with 0 . 1 M LiCl , 0 . 1 M Tris ( pH 8 ) , 10 mM EDTA and 1 % SDS . A M . oryzae liquid culture was prepared as described in section 2 . 2 . 2 . 1 . The mycelium was harvested in Miracloth , freeze dried in liquid nitrogen , and ground to a powder which was then added to a sterile Oakridge tube containing 5ml of the extraction buffer and 5ml of phenol . After inverting for 1 minute 5ml of chloroform was added . The tube was mixed 74 Chapter 2 again by inverting for 1 minute and then centrifuged at 15 , 700 x g , 4 ºC , for 30 minutes . The aqueous phase ( top , clear phase ) was transferred to a new sterile Oakridge tube , 1 volume of 4M LiCL was added and the sample was then incubated at 4 ºC overnight . The sample was then centrifuged at 15 , 700 x g , 4 ºC for 20 minutes . The resulting pellet was washed with 70 % ethanol before being resuspended in 500μl DEPC treated water . The sample was transferred to a 1 . 5 ml sterile , nuclease - free centrifuge tube to which 500 μl phenol : CIA was added . The sample was mixed by inverting for 30 seconds before being centrifuged at 17 ' 000 x g , 4 ºC , for 10 minutes . The aqueous phase was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and the RNA was precipitated by adding 0 . 1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 2 ) and 2 volumes of ethanol before being incubated overnight at - 20 ºC . The sample was then centrifuged at 17 ' 000 x g , 4 ºC for 20 minutes . The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70 % ethanol and resuspended in 100μl DEPC treated water . The total RNA solution was stored at - 80 ºC . 2 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 2 Extraction of S . cerevisiae total RNA To extract total RNA from S . cerevisiae , liquid cultures were prepared by incubating at 30 ºC with shaking ( 200 rpm ) 50ml of liquid YPD inoculated with a single yeast colony . The cultures were allowed to grow until stationary phase is reached ( ~ 16 hours for YPD , ~ 48 hours for drop - out media ) . The cultures were then diluted to an optical density of OD660 = 0 . 3 ( ~ 3 . 85 x 106 cells / ml ) and allowed to grow at 30 ºC with shaking for a further 3 hours . Yeast cells were collected by centrifuging at 800 x g for 5 minutes in Falcon tubes . Having discarded the supernatant the cells were resuspended with 1 ml of Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen ) to lyse the cells and transferred to a nuclease - free 1 . 5 ml centrifuge tube . To aid homogenisation , glass beads were added to the lysed 75 Chapter 2 cells which were first incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature and then incubated for 10 minutes in a thermoshaker at 60 ºC . After vortexing for 15 seconds 200 μl of chloroform were added followed by vigorous shaking by hand and incubation at room temperature for 3 minutes . The sample was centrifuged at 12 ' 000 x g , 4 ºC , for 15 minutes . The top RNA containing aqueous phase was carefully transferred to a fresh nuclease - free 1 . 5ml centrifuge tube with extra care not to disturb the red organic phase or the white DNA containing interphase . To precipitate the RNA , 500 μl of isopropyl - alcohol were added before incubating at room temperature for 15 minutes and centrifuging the sample at 12 ' 000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 ºC . The supernatant was discarded and the RNA pellet washed with 75 % ethanol . After the washing step , the pellet was air dried for 5 - 10 minutes and then dissolved in 50 μl nuclease - free water . 2 . 2 . 4 DNA manipulations 2 . 2 . 4 . 1 DNA digestion with restriction enzymes All restriction enzymes ( RE ) and RE buffers were ordered from Promega . The optimal RE buffer composition was selected according to the Compatible Buffers search tool available at http : / / www . promega . com / guides / re _ guide / Default . htm . Plasmid DNA digestions were prepared by mixing in a sterile microcentrifuge tube the desired amount of plasmid DNA ( between 50 ng and 1 μg ) , with 1 μl of each desired restriction enzyme at 12 units / μl concentration , 2 μl of RE buffer at 10 X concentration ( the RE buffer composition varied according to the RE used ) , 0 . 2 μl of acetylated bovine serum albumin at 1 μg / μl , and sterile , nuclease - free water to 20 μl volume . The reactions were incubated at 37 ºC for at least 2 hours and up to 16 hours , depending on the amount of plasmid DNA to be digested and the predicted enzyme activity . 76 Chapter 2 2 . 2 . 4 . 2 Ligation of DNA fragments DNA fragments were ligated with the Promega T4 Ligase DNA kit . A molar ratio of 1 : 3 vector : insert was used for ligation reactions . The appropriate quantities of DNA vector and ligand , were determined with the following formula : ( ng vector x kb size of insert ) / kb size of vector . Ligation reactions were thus prepared by mixing appropriate quantity of vector with the appropriate quantity of insert , 1 μl T4 DNA Ligase Buffer ( 10X ) , 1 μl T4 DNA ligase ( 1 Weiss unit / μl ) and nuclease - free H 2 O to make a final volume of 10 μl . The ligase reactions were incubated for 3 hours at room temperature . 2 . 2 . 4 . 3 DNA gel electrophoresis Agarose gels were prepared by creating 0 . 6 % ( w / v ) to 1 . 5 % ( w / v ) agarose solution with a TBE buffer ( 0 . 09 M Tris - borate and 0 . 002M EDTA ) . The solution was heated to boiling temperatures to melt the agarose and allowed to cool to ~ 60 ºC . Ethidium Bromide was added to stain DNA ( final concentration 0 . 5 μg ml - 1 ) . The solution was allowed to cool to ~ 50 ºC and poured in the appropriate gel tray . The DNA samples of interest were stained with gel loading dye and loaded into the gel wells . The gel was then subjected to electrical current of maximum 110 v . 1kb plus ( Invitrogen ) and HyperLadder I ( Bioline ) size markers were used to determine the length of DNA fragments . The DNA fragments were visualised with a gel documentation system ( Image Master ® VDS with a Fujifilm Thermal Imaging system FTI - 500 , Pharmacia Biotech ) . 77 Chapter 2 2 . 2 . 4 . 4 Gel purification of DNA fragments DNA fragments were purified from the agarose gel using the Wizard ® SV Gel and PCR Clean - Up System ( Promega ) . Fragments were excised from the gel with a sterile razor and placed in a 1 . 5 ml microcentrifuge tube . For every 10 mg of agarose gel 10 μl of membrane binding solution ( 4 . 5 M guanidine isothiocyanate and 0 . 5 M potassium acetate [ pH 5 . 0 ] ) were added . The membrane binding solution acts as a chaotropic agent which is necessary for DNA to bind the silica membrane in the SV Minicolumn ( Promega ) . The microcentrifuge was vortexed and then placed in a 60 ºC water bath for 15 minutes or until the gel was completely dissolved . A SV Minicolumn was placed in a collection tube and the dissolved DNA fragment solution transferred into it . Following 1 minute of incubation at room temperature the SV Minicolumn / collection tube unit was centrifuged at 16 ' 000 x g for 1 minute . The liquid in the collection tube was discarded and the SV Minicolumn placed back into it . The column was washed by adding 700μl of Membrane Wash Solution ( 10 mM potassium acetate [ pH 5 . 0 ] , 16 . 7 μM EDTA [ pH 8 . 0 ] and 80 % ethanol ) and centrifuging at 16 ' 000 x g for 1 minute . The collection tube was emptied and the SV Minicolumn placed back into it . The wash step was repeated by adding 500μl of Membrane Wash Solution and centrifuging at 16 ' 000 x g for 5 minutes . The SV Minicolumn was transferred into a new microcentrifuge tube and the DNA was eluted by adding 50 μl of nuclease - free water and centrifuging at 16 ' 000 x g for 1 minute . 2 . 2 . 5 Cloning of PCR products Routine cloning of amplified DNA fragments was performed using the StrataClone TM PCR Cloning Kit ( Agilent technologies ) which is based on the combined activities of 78 Chapter 2 topoisomerase I and Cre recombinase . ( Abremski et al . , 1983 ; Shuman , 1994 ) . The vector mix included in the kit contains two DNA fragments . One end of the arms is charged with topoisomerase I and also feature a modified uridine overhang , the other end contains a loxP recognition sequence . Purified DNA fragments from PCR reactions are ligated via the hybridisation of poly adenine ( A ) tail with the uridine overhangs . Cre recombinase then catalyses ion of the loxP recognition sequences to form a circular DNA molecule ( pSC - A ) with resistance to ampicillin and a lacZ ' α - complementation cassette for blue - white screening . Ligation reaction mixtures were prepared by adding 3 μl StrataClone Cloning buffer , 2 μl of purified DNA fragment ( 5 - 50 ng ) and 1 μl StrataClone vector mix to a sterile microcentrifuge tube . The reactions were incubated for 30 minutes and then placed in ice . 1 μl of the cloning reaction mixture was added to a tube of thawed StrataClone SoloPack ® competent cells . These cells express the gene encoding Cre recombinase which is necessary for the transformation to work . The genotype of SoloPack ® competent cells is Tet r Δ ( mcr A ) 183 Δ ( mcr CB - hsd SMR - mrr ) 173 end A1 sup E44 thi - 1 rec A1 gyr A96 rel A1 lac Hte [ F′ pro AB lac I q ZΔM15 Tn10 ( Tet r ) Amy Cam r ] . The cells were incubated on ice for 20 minutes and then heat shocked at 42 ºC for 45 seconds . Following another two minutes on ice , 250 μl SOC medium ( pre - warmed to 42 ºC ) were added to the competent cells which were then allowed to recover for 1 hour at 37 ºC with shaking ( 250 rpm ) . LB plates ( 1 % tryptone , 0 . 5 % yeast extract , 86mM NaCl [ pH to 7 . 5 ] and 1 % agar ) were treated with ampicillin ( 1μl per ml of media ) and X - gal ( 40μl of a 2 % solution spread on set plates ) . The transformation mixture was placed on the LB plates in different amounts ( 20 μl , 80 μl and 200 μl ) and incubated overnight at 37 ºC . 79 Chapter 2 Bacterial colonies that successfully transformed with pSC - A containing the DNA fragment were recognised by white coloration , bacterial colonies that transformed with pSC - A without the DNA fragment were recognised by blue coloration . White colonies were picked , placed in 4 ml LB with 4 μl ampicillin , and grown overnight at 37 ºC with shaking ( 200 rpm ) . 2 . 2 . 6 Transformation of bacterial hosts To transform bacterial hosts with plasmid DNA , the XL - 1 Blue , transformation - competent , Escherichia coli strain was used . The genotype of XL - 1 Blue is : sup E44 hsd R17 rec A1 end A1 gry A46 thi rel A1 lac - [ F ' pro AB + lac I q lac ZΔM15 Tn 10 ( tet r ) ] . An aliquot of 50 ng of plasmid DNA was mixed with a 100 μl aliquot of XL - I Blue competent cells in a 10 ml transformation tube , and incubated for 30 mins on ice . The cells were then heat shocked at 42 ºC for 45 seconds , before adding 800 μl of SOC ( 2 % tryptone , 0 . 5 % yeast extract , 0 . 05 % sodium chloride , 20mM glucose , 10 mM , magnesium sulfate and10 mM , magnesium chloride ) . The cells were allowed to recover by incubation at 37 ºC for 1 hour with gentle shaking ( 125 rpm ) . Three aliquots of the cells ( routinely , 20 μl , 80 μl and 200 μl ) were then plated on LB plates treated with ampicillin . Plates were incubated overnight , successful transformants were selected by resistance to ampicillin . 2 . 2 . 7 Plasmid DNA preparation The Promega Wizard ® Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System was used to carry out plasmid DNA preparations . Overnight bacterial cultures were harvested by transferring to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuging at 10 ' 000 x g for 5 minutes . The supernatant 80 Chapter 2 was discarded and the tube inverted and blotted dry on paper towel to remove excess media . 250 μl of Cell Resuspension Solution ( 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 10 mM EDTA , 100 μg / ml RNase A ) was used to resuspend the pellet by repeated pipetting . 250 μl of Cell Lysis solution ( 0 . 2 M NaOH , 1 % SDS ) were added to lyse the cells . SDS solubilises phospholipid and protein components of the plasma membrane which causes lysis and release of cell content . After brief mixing by inverting the microcentrifuge tube the cells were allowed to lyse for 1 minute at room temperature . To inactivate any endonucleases released from cells lysing , 10 μl of Alkaline Protease Solution ( components not specified in the accompanying documentation ) were added , the tube was inverted four times , and the lysed cells incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes . 350 μl of Neutralisation Solution ( 4 . 09 M guanidine hydrochloride , 0 . 759 M potassium acetate , 2 . 12 M glacial acetic acid ) were added to the lysed cells and the tube inverted four times to mix . The high salt concentration causes potassium dodecyl sulfate to coprecipitate with chromosomal DNA and cellular debris . The bacterial lysate was then centrifuged at 14 ' 000 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature . DNA purification units was prepared by inserting one Spin Column in a Collection Tube for each sample . The clear aqueous top phase ( ~ 700 μl ) was transferred to the spin column with extra care not to disturb the white organic phase . The DNA purification units were centrifuged at 14 ' 000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature . The flow - through in the collection tube was discarded and 750 μl of Column Wash Solution ( 60 mM potassium acetate , 8 . 3 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 04 mM EDTA , 60 % ethanol ) was added to the spin column . The purification unit was centrifuged at 14 ' 000 x g for 1 minute , the flow - through discarded , and the step repeated with 250 μl of Column Wash Solution . 81 Chapter 2 The Spin Column was then placed in a new sterile 1 . 5 ml microcentrifuge tube and the DNA eluted by adding 100 μl of nuclease - free water , incubating for 1 minute at room temperature , and centrifuging at 14 ' 000 for 1 minute . The plasmid DNA preparations were stored at - 20 ºC . 2 . 2 . 8 RNA manipulations 2 . 2 . 8 . 1 RNA gel electrophoresis The integrity of total RNA extracted from Magnaporthe oryzae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , was verified by denaturing gel electrophoresis . To denature samples a solution consisting of a total RNA sample , 50 % ( v / v ) formamide , 2 . 2 M formaldehyde , 1 x MOPS / EDTA buffer ( 20 mM 3 - [ N - morpholino ] - propanesulfoni acid , 5mM sodium acetate , 1mM EDTA [ pH 7 . 0 ] ) was incubated at 65 ºC for 15 minutes . 1μl of Ethidium bromide ( 10 mg / ml ) was added to aid visualisation of RNA fragments . The gel was prepared by melting 1 . 2 % ( w / v ) agarose in deionised water , allowing it to cool to ~ 60 ºC , and adding 40 % formaldehyde ( which gives 2 . 2 M ) and 1 X MOPS / EDTA . An RNA marker was used during electrophoresis to determine size and molecular mass estimation of the RNA sample ( 0 . 24 - 9 . 5 kb ladder , Invitrogen ) . 2 . 2 . 8 . 2 Reverse - transcription PCR To reverse transcribe RNA samples and amplify a DNA sequence of interest from the synthesised cDNA strands the Titanium TM One - Step RT - PCR Kit ( Clontech ) was used . This system allows to perform RT - PCR in one step by having both reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase in the reaction mixture . Reactions were prepared by adding to the RNA sample ( 20 ng - 1 μg ) 1 X One - Step Buffer ( 400 mM Tricine , 200 mM KCl , 30 82 Chapter 2 mM MgCl 2 , 37 . 5 μg / ml BSA ) , 1 X dNTP ( deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate ) mix ( final concentration 0 . 2 mM each ) , 0 . 4 units / ml of Recombinant RNase Inhibitor , 50 % ( v / v ) Thermostabilising Reagent ( trehalose solution ( Carninci et al . , 1998 ) , precise concentrations not mentioned in kit documentation ) , 20 % ( v / v ) GC - Melt ( U . S . Patent No . 5 , 545 , 539 ) , 0 . 4 μM Oligo ( dT ) Primer , 1 X Titanium Taq RT Enzyme Mix ( includes MMLV - RT , Titanium Taq Polymerase and TaqStart Antibody ) and 0 . 9 μM of each experimental primer . The samples were then incubated in a thermal cycler instructed with the following program : 1 . 50 ºC for 1 hour ( required for cDNA synthesis ) ; 2 . 94 ºC for 5 minutes ; 3 . 30 - 35 cycles ( depending on expected copy number of mRNA molecule of interest ) comprising 94 ºC for 30 seconds , 65 ºC for 30 seconds , and 72 ºC for 1 minute per 1 kb of amplicon ; 5 . A final extension step at 72 ºC for 2 minutes . Results were analysed by gel electrophoresis and visualised with gel documentation system . 2 . 2 . 9 Treatment and reverse transcription of total RNA for rapid amplification of 5 ' and 3 ' cDNA ends To determine the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of MOPIL2 coding sequence the GeneRacer ® Kit with SuperScript ® III RT ( Invitrogen ) was used . This protocol works by first removing the 5 ' phosphates of non - mRNA and truncated mRNA within total RNA samples , thereby eliminating them from subsequent ligation with GeneRacer RNA oligo . The 5 ' cap structure of full length mRNA is then removed and the RNA oligo attached to the exposed 5 ' phosphates . Reverse transcription of the RNA sample is then carried out , and the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the coding sequence of interest can be amplified using primers specific to the ligated RNA oligo sequence , in conjunction with gene specific primers . 83 Chapter 2 2 . 2 . 9 . 1 Dephosphorylation of non - mRNA and truncated mRNA from M . oryzae total RNA The total RNA sample was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase ( CIP ) by mixing 4 μl of the RNA ( ~ 600 ng / μl ) with 1 μl CIP buffer ( 10X ) , 1 μl RNaseOut TM ( 40 U / μl ) , 1 μl CIP ( 10 U / μl ) and 3 μl nuclease free H 2 O in a 1 . 5 ml microcentrifuge tube . The reaction was mixed and incubated at 50 ºC for 1 hour and then placed on ice after brief centrifugation . 2 . 2 . 9 . 2 RNA precipitation To precipitate the RNA , 90 μl nuclease - free H 2 O and 100 μl phenol : chloroform were added to the RNA sample and vortexed vigorously for 30 seconds . The sample was then centrifuged at 16 ' 000 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature . The top aqueous phase was transferred to a new 1 . 5 ml microcentrifuge tube to which 2 μl mussel glycogen ( 10 mg / ml ) and 10 μl NaOAc ( 3 M ) was added . After mixing , 220 μl ethanol ( 95 % ) was added and the tube vortexed briefly . The mixture was frozen in dry ice for ten minutes and then centrifuged at 16 ' 000 x g for 20 minutes at 4 ºC to pellet the RNA . The supernatant was removed by pipetting so as not to disturb the pellet . 500 μl ethanol ( 70 % ) was added to the pellet and the tube inverted several times and vortexed briefly . The tube was centrifuged at 16 ' 000 x g for 2 minutes at 4 ºC . The ethanol was removed by pipetting and the tube centrifuged again for a 1 minute . Remaining ethanol was removed and pell et al lowed to air dry for 2 minutes at room temperature . The pellet was resuspended in 7 μl nuclease - free H 2 O . 84 Chapter 2 2 . 2 . 9 . 3 Removing Cap structures from full length mRNA Dephosphorylated RNA was treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase ( TAP ) to remove cap structures from full length mRNA . To do this , 7 μl dephosphorylated RNA was mixed with 1 μl TAP buffer ( 10X ) , 1 μl RNaseOut TM ( 40 U / μl ) , 1 μl TAP ( 0 . 5 U / μl ) in a 1 . 5 ml microcentrifuge tube . The mixture was vortexed briefly and centrifuged to collect liquids and then incubated for 1 hour at 37 ºC . The tube was pulse centrifuged and placed on ice . The RNA was then precipitated as described in section 2 . 2 . 7 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 9 . 4 Ligation of RNA oligonucleotide to decapped full length mRNA 7 μl of the dephosphorylated , decapped full length mRNA were added to the lypholised GeneRacer TM RNA oligo ( 0 . 25 μg ) which was resuspended by gentle pipetting and mixing . The RNA solution was incubated for 5 minutes at 65 ºC to relax secondary structure and then placed on ice for 2 minutes . To ligate the RNA oligo to decapped RNA , 1 μl ligase buffer ( 10X ) , 1 μl ATP ( 10 mM ) , 1 μl RNaseOut TM ( 40 U / μl ) and 1 μl T4 RNA ligase ( 5 U / μl ) , were added to the RNA solution and mixed by pipetting . The tube was incubated for 1 hour at 37 ºC , pulse centrifuged and placed on ice . The RNA was precipitated as described in section 2 . 2 . 7 . 2 except the RNA pellet was resuspended in 10 μl nuclease - free H 2 O . 2 . 2 . 9 . 5 Reverse - transcription of mRNA 1 μl GeneRacer TM Oligo dT Primer ( 50 μM ) , 1 μl dNTP mix ( 10 mM each nucleotide ) , and 1 μl nuclease - free H 2 O were added to the 10 μl RNA solution obtained in section 2 . 2 . 7 . 4 in a 1 . 5 ml microcentrifuge tube . The tube was incubated for 5 minutes at 65 ºC to unravel any secondary RNA structure and then chilled on ice for 1 minute . The 85 Chapter 2 following reagents were then added : 4 μl first strand buffer ( 5X ) , 1 μl DTT ( 0 . 1 M ) , 1 μl RNaseOut TM ( 40 U / μl ) and 1 μl SuperScript TM III reverse transcriptase ( 200 U / μl ) . The reagents were mixed well , pulse centrifuged , and incubated at 50 ºC for 45 minutes . The reverse transcription ( RT ) reaction was inactivated by incubating the tube at 70 ºC for 15 minutes and then chilling on ice for 2 minutes . The tube was pulse centrifuged and 1 μl RNase H ( 2U ) was added to the reaction mix . Finally , the RT reaction was incubated at 37 ºC for 20 minutes and then stored at - 20 ºC or used immediately for PCR reaction . 2 . 2 . 10 DNA sequencing Sequencing of DNA fragments of interest within plasmid DNA was carried out by Beckman Coulter Genomics ( Hope End , Takeley , Essex UK ) . 10μl solutions containing 100 ng / ml plasmid DNA were sent for primer extension ( PE ) sequencing with universal primers M13F and M13R unless otherwise stated . The sequencing was performed with the Sanger method using the BigDye ® Terminator v3 . 1 Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . Fluorescently labelled DNA fragments were analysed with the 3730xl DNA analyser ( Applied Biosystems ) . Sequencing data was returned in the form of . AB1 format files . Sequencing reads were edited and assembled into contigs with Sequencher ( GenoCodes Corporation ) . 2 . 2 . 11 Fungal transformation 2 . 2 . 11 . 1 Transformation of Magnaporthe oryzae A M . oryzae liquid culture was prepared as described in section 2 . 2 . 2 . 1 . The mycelium was harvested by filtration through sterile Miracloth and washed with distilled water before being transferred to a Falcon tube with 40 ml OM buffer ( 1 . 2 M MgSO 4 , 10 mM 86 Chapter 2 NaPO 4 [ pH 5 . 8 ] ) and a 5 % solution of the lytic enzyme beta - 1 , 3 - glucanase ( glucanex ) . The mycelium solution was then incubated at 30 ºC for 3 hours with gentle shaking ( 75 rpm ) to allow the removal of the cell wall . The resulting protoplasts were transferred to a sterile Oakridge tube and overlaid with an equal volume of cold ( ~ 4 ºC ) ST buffer ( 0 . 6 M sucrose , 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl [ pH 7 ] ) . The protoplast solution was then centrifuged at 1 ' 500 x g , 4 ºC , in a swinging bucket rotor . The protoplast containing OM / ST interphase was transferred to a new Oakridge tube and filled with cold STC buffer ( 1 . 2 M sucrose , 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 10 mM CaCl 2 ) . The resulting solution was centrifuged at 1 ' 500 x g , 4 ºC , for 10 minutes . The protoplast pellet was washed twice with 10 ml STC , and then resuspended in 1 ml STC . The concentration of protoplasts was measured by counting using a heamocytometer . A transformation solution was prepared by combining in a microcentrifuge tube the protoplast solution ( ~ 10 7 cells / ml ) with the insert plasmid DNA ( 5 μg - 10 μg ) in a total volume of 150μl . The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes after which 1 ml of PTC ( 60 % PEG 400 , 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 10 mM CaCl 2 ) was added and gently mixed . The protoplast solution mixture was added to 150 ml of BDCM media ( 1 . 7 g L - 1 yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate , 2 g L - 1 ammonium nitrate , 1 g L - 1 aspargine , 10 g L - 1 glucose , 0 . 8 M sucrose and 15 g L - 1 agar , melted and cooled to 45 ºC ) . The media was then poured into 5 Petri dishes , which were incubated in the dark for 16 h at 24 ºC . For selection of sulfonylurea resistant transformants , the plates were overlaid with 15 ml of BDCM containing 50 μg / ml of chlorimuron ethyl . 87 Chapter 2 2 . 2 . 11 . 2 Transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae To transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains , the method based on the use of Lithium Acetate , single - stranded carrier DNA and polyethylene glycol ( Gietz & Woods , 2002 ) was used . For each transformation procedure , 10ml of YPD liquid medium was inoculated with a colony of the desired mutant S . cerevisiae strain and incubated overnight at 30 (cid:176) C with shaking ( 200 rpm ) . The budding yeast cell concentration of the overnight culture was estimated by measuring the optical density of the culture with a spectrophotometer . The culture was diluted to an OD 600 of 0 . 4 in 50ml of YPD medium and incubated at 30 ºC with shaking ( 200 rpm ) for 3 h . S . cerevisiae cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 2 ' 500 rpm for 5 mins , and resuspended in 40 ml of 1 x TE ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ; 1mM EDTA ) . The cells were pelleted again by centrifugation at 2 ' 500 rpm for 5 mins , but were then resuspended in 2 ml of a LiAc / TE solution ( 100 mM Lithium Acetate , pH 7 . 5 ; 0 . 5 x TE ) . The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 10 mins . For each transformation , 1 μg of transformation vector , and 100 μg denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA were mixed with 100 μl of the cells suspended in LiAc / TE . At this point , 700 μl of a LiAc / PEG - 3350 / TE ( 1 x Lithium Acetate , pH 7 . 5 ; 40 % PEG - 3350 ; 1 x TE ) were added and mixed well into the cell suspension solution , which was then incubated at 30 ºC for 30 mins . After adding 88 μl of DMSO and mixing well , the cell solution was subjected to heat shock at 42 ºC for 7 mins . The cells were then centrifuged for 10 seconds at 12 ' 000 x g , and the supernatant was discarded . After resuspending in 1 ml of 1 x TE , the cells were pelleted again , but then resuspended in 100 μl of 1 x TE . Finally , the cells were plated on synthetic , minimal defined medium lacking in uracil ( 6 . 7 g L - 1 yeast nitrogen base , 20 g L - 1 glucose , 0 . 1 g L - 1 adenine , 0 . 1 g L - 1 arginine , 0 . 1 g L - 1 cysteine , 0 . 1 g L - 1 leucine , 0 . 1 g L - 88 Chapter 2 1 lysine , 0 . 1 g L - 1 threonine , 0 . 1 g L - 1 tryptophan , 0 . 05 g L - 1 aspartic acid , 0 . 05 g L - 1 histidine , 0 . 05 g L - 1 isoleucine , 0 . 05 g L - 1 methionine , 0 . 05 g L - 1 phenylalanine , 0 . 05 g L - 1 proline , 0 . 05 g L - 1 serine , 0 . 05 g L - 1 tyrosine , 0 . 05 g L - 1 valine , and 20 g L - 1 agar ) . Successful transformants were prototrophic for uracil , thus grew in the uracil deficient minimal medium . 89 Chapter 3 3 Modular definition of the CME interactome network 3 . 1 Introduction Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a form of pinocytosis which has been studied extensively in the attempt to understand the molecular details of neural synaptic activity ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Mueller et al . , 2004 ) . In the introduction of this thesis , I identified the evolutionary history of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) as an important case study for understanding the origin and diversification of endocytosis in eukaryotes . There are multiple factors that make it so . First of all it is ancestral to all eukaryotes , as demonstrated by the presence of key CME proteins clathrin and the AP2 α and β subunits in all the main eukaryotic supergroups ( Dacks et al . , 2008 ; Field et al . , 2006 ) , with phylogenetic analyses of the adaptin protein family showing that AP complexes share a common origin but diversified prior to the branching of the major eukaryote supergroups ( Boehm & Bonifacino , 2001 ; Dacks et al . , 2008 ; Schledzewski et al . , 1999 ) . Considering that the four recognised AP complexes are involved at different compartments of the endomembrane system , and that only the AP2 complex is known to work in endocytosis ( Boehm & Bonifacino , 2001 ; Robinson , 2004 ) , this suggests that the process of endocytosis via the clathrin coated vesicle was already specialised in the last common eukaryotic ancestor ( LCEA ) . Moreover , molecular evolution data indicates that other protein families involved in CME , such as the AP180 adaptor , epsin and dynamin , were too present in the LCEA ( Elde et al . , 2005 ; Field et al . , 2006 ; Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) , adding further credibility and detail to the CME pathway in LCEA . 90 Chapter 3 Secondly , as a result of a massive effort to understand endocytic activity in synapses , an impressive degree of molecular detail has been achieved in the description of the CME machinery . This includes the identification of a near complete inventory of the functional proteins that play a role in the pathway ( Blondeau et al . , 2004 ; McPherson & Ritter , 2005 ) and the understanding of what they do and how they interact ( see sections 3 . 3 . 1 - 3 . 3 . 6 for a descriptions ) . Importantly , a key aspect of the CME process is the interaction of core endocytic structural and adaptor proteins with the actin cytoskeleton . Current data has identified multiple proteins that mediate this interactions . As mentioned in the introduction , studying the evolution of the complex system behind cytoskeletal regulation of plasma membrane dynamics is crucial to understanding the early autogenous evolution of the eukaryotic endomembrane system , and it is an important question of this study . In light of this question , it is proposed here to study CME holistically , i . e . as the known integrated system of protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions , known as the CME interactome ( CME - I ) ( Schmid & McMahon , 2007 ) , that carry out the functional requirements of this process . This provides the opportunity to investigate the evolution of CME by studying the evolution of interacting proteins in relation to each other and to the specific sub - processes they mediate . According to this approach , a synapomorphy can be identified not only by a novel protein family , but by an interaction , identified by experimental analysis , between any two given protein families . If , for example , origin of protein family A ( Figure 3 . 1 ) is pinpointed at point X in the eukaryotic radiation , and 91 Chapter 3 origin of protein family B is pinpointed to at point Y in the eukaryotic radiation which is more derived than branch X , the interaction between A and B is a synapomorphy which should be pinpointed to branch Y ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . By applying these criteria to the whole network of interacting proteins it is possible to construct a model depicting the most likely CME - I network on different branches of eukaryotic tree of life . The resulting model will allow to estimate whether major modifications have occurred to the cellular process and at which stages of eukaryotic evolution . The main questions covered in this and the next chapter are therefore the following . Considering that CME is ancient and likely to have been significantly specialised in the LCEA , and that the known mammalian and yeast models of CME are very complex , involve a system of cytoskeletal regulation , and are best described by an interactome of more than 40 proteins , how did the complex CME system studied in yeast and mammals evolve ? Also , how did the cytoskeletal regulatory system of CME evolve , and what can it tell us about autogenous co - evolution ? Finally , I ask what is the degree of conservation of the CME interactome across the diversity of eukaryotes ? The aim of this chapter is to construct a model of the CME - I that can be used as the foundation for the phylogenomic study presented in Chapter 4 . This has in part already been done . Previous analyses and perspectives have outlined interactomes related to CME . Notably , Lafer ( Traffic , 2002 ) , summarised clathrin binding partners in the format of an interaction web , and the model partially overlaps with the one presented here . However , it covers the entirety of vesicular trafficking mediated by clathrin coated vesicles , both in an endocytic and a secretory capacity , and the functional and modular 92 Chapter 3 93 Figure 3 . 1 Novel interaction between two network components as a synapomorphy . Considering the interaction between hypothetical network components A and B from an hypothetical interactome composed by A , B , C and D , if A is acquired in branch X and B is acquired in branch Y which is more derived than X , the origin of the A - B interaction is pinpointed to branch Y . Therefore , while A is a synapomorphy ( shared derived character ) of taxa 3 - 6 , and B is a synapomorphy of taxa 5 - 6 , the A - B interaction is a synapomorphy specific to taxa 5 - 6 . In the schematic tree , black cirlces represent acquisition of network component , and red line represents acquisition of interaction between two components . Chapter 3 characterisation of the network is minimal . Two further examples are by Drubin ( Novartis Found Symp , 2005 ) and Traub ( Nat . Rev . Mol . Cell . Biol . , 2009 ) , where the former looks at protein networks in endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton in yeast , and the latter at the network of clathrin adaptors and respective internalisation signals . The interactome model presented by Schmid & McMahon ( Nature , 2007 ) , is the closest to the one described in this chapter , both in terms of protein selection and modular correlation to functional stages of CME . However , in none of these interactome models there is specific information regarding the binding abilities of conserved functional domains . This is an important issue because even a brief review of the CME proteome can highlight several protein families with complex protein domain architectures , with some functional domains being shared between more that one protein family , but in different combinations . For an evolutionary study of the CME - I network , it is thus important to pinpoint when specific functional domains where acquired within a protein family , because this will allow us to also pinpoint when the specific interaction mediated by the functional group was acquired . Therefore the model of the CME - I needed here has to highlight the protein domain architectures of its components . The CME pathway can be described as linear sequence of steps , i . e . formation of clathrin coated pits , membrane invagination , vesicle scission , internalisation of vesicle , vesicle uncoating and recycling of vesicle coat components ( Brodin et al . , 2000 ) , recognition of cargo internalisation signals ( Traub , 2003 ) , recruitment of clathrin to sites of endocytosis ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) , deformation of the plasma membrane ( Futterer & Machesky , 2007 ) , recruitment of dynamin to site of vesicle scission ( Hinshaw & Schmid , 1995 ) , polymerisation of actin filaments ( Yamada et al . , 2009 ) , 94 Chapter 3 dephosphorylation of vesicle coat components ( Verstreken et al . , 2003 ) . These molecular functions are spatially and temporally coordinated within the CME - I . In this chapter , I present a model of the CME - I network by 1 ) reviewing the molecular components of this system , 2 ) creating a visual model depicting the intricate set of interactions , and 3 ) drawing a functional link between sections of the interactome and functional requirement in CME . 3 . 2 Materials and methods 3 . 2 . 1 Definition of the CME - I network The protein components of the CME - I network were identified using literature review . The criteria for inclusion is proof of involvement in CME molecular machinery by functional molecular and cell biological studies and physical interaction to at least two CME proteins . Protein domain architectures were identified by searching conserved domain database CDD and Hidden Markov Model database PFAM , using each CME - I network protein as seed . To visualise the CME - I network , a diagram was drawn out depicting each protein - protein and protein - lipid interaction catalogued in the study . This visual model includes the name of the protein family and the protein domain architecture of each CME - I protein . Protein domain architectures were identified by searching conserved domain database CDD and Hidden Markov Model database PFAM , as described in section 2 . 1 . 3 , with each CME - I network protein as seed . Where available , information on the location of the binding sites was used to draw lines representing interactions . In addition , AP2 subunit binding motifs and clathrin heavy chain binding motifs were included in the model . Known interactions between 95 Chapter 3 endocytic adaptors and cargo receptors , and internalisation signal motifs were also included ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . Information on protein function of CME - I network proteins was used to to divide the CME - I network into functional modules . The formatting convention used to refer to CME - I proteins in the original literature varies depending on the model organism they were studied in . In this study , protein names derived from acronyms are written in capital letters , whereas all other protein names are written in smaller case except when starting a sentence . When referring to protein domains , the naming convention adopted by PFAM is used in this study . 3 . 3 Results Data from 65 published experiments was used to create an inventory of the known protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions which make up the CME - I network ( see Table 3 . 1 , for references ) . The literature review focused on robust experimental evidence to confirm interactions between two components . A total of 39 proteins belonging to 21 gene families were included in the interactome . For each CME - I network protein , Table 3 . 1 lists the SWISS - PROT database accession numbers , known function , known CME interacting partners , experimental background information , taxonomic information , and source literature . A visual model of the CME - I network was created ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . In the model , CME - I components were described in terms of their protein family and known protein domain architecture . Knowledge on the properties of protein domains or binding motifs , was used to pinpoint binding sites for each interaction . 96 Chapter 3 Table 1 . CME - I network proteins .

( Scheele et al . , 2001 ) . 3 . 3 . 1 Description of the CME - I network Here I briefly review the protein components of the CME - I network in relation to their function within the interactome . To manage the complexity of the CME system , I divided it into five functional modules : ( i ) core , ( ii ) membrane bending , ( iii ) vesicle scission , ( iv ) actin attachment , and ( v ) vesicle uncoating . 3 . 3 . 2 The core module of the CME - I network The core module is composed of clathrin ( heavy and light chains ) , the AP2 complex , epsins , AP180 , CALM , EPS15 and the following monomeric adaptors : β arrestins , disabled 2 , numb and ARH . These proteins mediate the formation of the clathrin pit and the binding of cargo ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Gaidarov & Keen , 1999 ; Traub , 2003 ; B . Wendland & Emr , 1998 ) . AP2 is an heterotetrameric complex made of two large 101 Chapter 3 102 Chapter 3 subunits ( α and β2 ) , one medium subunit ( μ ) and one small subunit ( σ ) . The AP2 complex binds plasma membrane component phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - biphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ] via the large α subunit ( Gaidarov & Keen , 1999 ) , while recruiting clathrin at the site of pit formation via the β2 subunit ( Traub et al . , 1996 ) . In addition , the μ subunit binds to cargo internalisation motifs such as YXXØ and [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . EPS15 binds to the AP2 complex , epsins and AP180 / CALM ( Maldonado - Baez et al . , 2008 ; Tebar et al . , 1996 ; Traub et al . , 1999 ) and it is believed to provide stability to the initial clathrin - AP2 complex ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Monomeric adaptors bind to clathrin heavy chain , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and the AP2 complex ( Traub , 2003 ) . In addition , they engage with endocytic receptors unrecognised by the AP2 complex . For instance , β arrestins 1 and 2 engage with active , phosphorylated cargo G protein - coupled receptor ( Laporte et al . , 1999 ) . Meanwhile , ARH , disabled 2 and numb engage with low density lipoprotein receptors such as VLDL , apoER2 and megalin via an N - terminal phosphotyrosine - binding ( PTB ) domain ( Traub , 2003 ) . 103 Figure 3 . 2 Connectivity diagram depicting the CME - I network . Data from 65 published studies ( Table 3 . 1 ) is used to outlined the CME - I network . Protein - protein and protein - lipid interaction have been demonstrated by co - immunoprecipitation , structural crystallography and two - hybrid screening . Protein domains are shown in coloured bars while protein names are in grey boxes . The X and the Y bars represent respectively clathrin binding motifs and AP2 appendage binding motifs . With the exception of UIM , protein domains are in scale . The rest of the diagram is not in scale . Internalisation signals are green in grey boxes ( EGF = epidermis growth factor ; UC = ubiquitinated cargo ; GPCR = G - protein coupled receptor ; YXXØ , [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] and FXNPXY represent consensus internalisation signal motifs ) . Blue elipse labeled PI2 represents phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - biphosphate . Protein - protein and protein - lipid binding interactions are shown with black lines . Chapter 3 Epsins and the AP180 and CALM paralogues , belong to the a protein superfamily which is characterised by an N - terminal , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 binding , protein domain known as the ENTH / ANTH domain ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2004 ) . Similarly to monomeric adaptors , they also bind clathrin , the AP2 complex and specific cargo internalisation signals ( e . g . transferrin and ubiquinated cargo ) ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . However , in addition to the adaptor - like functions , epsins are also proposed to create membrane curvature via an amphipathic α helix - formed upon epsin’s binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - which inserts into one leaflet of the membrane’s lipid bilayer thereby causing it to bend ( Ford et al . , 2002 ; Horvath et al . , 2007 ) ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . 3 . 3 . 3 The membrane bending module The membrane bending module consists of the BAR domain protein family which are divided into N - BAR and FCH sub - families . The two N - BAR proteins commonly studied are mammalian amphiphysin 1 - 2 and endophilin ( Rvs167 and Rvs161 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) which both have a N - terminal BAR domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . They form crescent shaped dimers that can sense , induce and maintain create curvature of the membrane . They do this via two known mechanisms : by binding to negatively charged phospholipids using electrostatic forces ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) and via an amphipathic α helix which is inserted in one leaflet of the lipid bilayer causing displacement of the phospholipids ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ; Masuda et al . , 2006 ) . FCH proteins are structurally related although the curvature they create is shallower by comparison ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . It is proposed that FCH proteins cause the deepening of the early clathrin coated pit by binding to the 104 Chapter 3 membrane , creating end - to - end oligomerisation of protein dimers which surround the 105 Figure 3 . 3 Core module of the CME - I . a .

Chapter 3 budding vesicle ( Futterer & Machesky , 2007 ) ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . 3 . 3 . 4 The vesicle scission module The vesicle scission module is composed of a sub - group of the dynamin protein family , known in mammals as ' classical dynamins ' ( Praefcke & McMahon , 2004 ) . Dynamin is a large and modular GTPase featuring four main functional domains ( Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . A large N - terminal domain of more than 300 amino acids features GTP binding motifs necessary for guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis . At the C - terminal we find , sequentially , a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 binding pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , a GTPase effector domain ( GED ) which activates dynamin self assembly and GTPase activity , and a proline rich domain ( PRD ) , a site of interaction with other endocytic effectors ( Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . Dynamin is thought to self assemble into a ring or helical structure around the deeply invaginated neck of a nascent vesicle , and cause its fission by constricting and severing invaginated pits following GTP hydrolysis - driven conformational changes ( Hinshaw & Schmid , 1995 ; Marks et al . , 2001 ) ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . 3 . 3 . 5 The actin attachment module Interaction of the actin cytoskeleton with the endocytic effectors is a key feature in CME ( Qualmann et al . , 2000 ) . Actin filaments provide support for the early stages of vesicle formation , then polymerise at the site where the vesicle’s neck narrows , and finally drive the inward movement of the vesicle following its dynamin mediated scission ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . The components of the actin attachment module link the endocytic machinery to the actin cytoskeleton either directly , by binding to actin filaments , or indirectly , by inducing actin polymerisation via a 107 Chapter 3 108 Figure 3 . 5 Vesicle scission module of the CME - I . a . Dynamin molecules assemble into a helical structure around the vesicle neck and causes scission by conformational changes . b . Connectivity diagram highlighting dynamins and its interactions with other CME - I network components . Chapter 3 signalling route . This module includes the HIP1 and HIP1R paralogues , ABP1 , tuba , intersectins , SNX9 and N - WASP . HIP1 has typical adaptor characteristics in that they bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , clathrin and the AP2 complex ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ) . Importantly , it can form heterodimers with HIP1R which in turn binds to filamentous actin via a C - terminal I / LWEQ talin domain ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) . ABP1 also binds actin filaments directly . It does so via the N - terminal ADF domain which promotes rapid filament turnover ( Goode et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , ABP1 features a C - terminal SH3 domain which has been shown to interact with proline rich domains ( PRD ) of dynamin ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ) . By contrast , tuba , intersectins and SNX9 regulate actin polymerisation indirectly , via interaction with N - WASP ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . The proposed mode of function of N - WASP is to bind to the plasma membrane via a central basic domain and a GTPase binding domain , while two C - terminal Wasp Homology ( WH2 ) domains bind to actin monomers and a Central / Acidic ( CA ) domain binds and activates the ARP2 / 3 complex ( Svitkina , 2007 ) . Actin filaments are recruited to N - WASP via the ARP2 / 3 complex , and are attached to the WH2 - associated actin monomers ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . N - WASP detaches to recruit more globular actin , and re - attaches to the barbed end of the actin filament ( Co et al . , 2007 ) . As the cycle repeats , actin filaments are elongated causing propulsion off the plasma membrane . Crucially , N - WASP features a centrally located proline rich domain that engages in interactions with the SH3 domains of other proteins involved in CME . For instance , SNX9 stimulates actin assembly by binding the PRD of 109 Chapter 3 110 Figure 3 . 6 Actin attachment module of the CME - I network . a The Actin cytoskeleton drives inward transport of clathrin coated vesicles . b Connectivity diagram highlighting CME - I network components involved in actin attachment module . Network components involved in the actin attachment module are in colour , other components are in grey . Chapter 3 N - WASP via its N - terminal SH3 domain ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . This links actin modulation to the CME core machinery as SNX9 also binds clathrin and the AP2 complex ( Lundmark & Carlsson , 2003 ) . Tuba features a centrally located BAR domain - homologous to the N - BAR domains in amphiphysin and endophilin – downstream of a RhoGEF domain . At the N - and C - terminals there are 4 and 2 SH3 domains , respectively . The SH3 domains at the N - terminal bind to N - WASP while the C - terminal SH3 domains are shown to selectively bind to dynamins ( Salazar et al . , 2003 ) . As with SNX9 , the SH3 mediated interaction with N - WASP induces actin assembly ( Salazar et al . , 2003 ) . Intersectins also include multiple SH3 domains that mediate the binding to N - WASP . This upregulates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) activity of intersectins , generating GTP - bound CDC42 , which in turn activates N - WASP actin nucleation activity ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ) ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . 3 . 3 . 6 The vesicle uncoating module Once the vesicle has been fully internalised the clathrin coat is removed and its polyhedral structure broken down so that clathrin triskelion monomers can be recycled ( Ungewickell & Hinrichsen , 2007 ) . The uncoating module is based on the combined functions of molecular chaperone HSC70 , its co - factor auxilin , and inositol phosphatase synaptojanin ( Massol et al . , 2006 ; Perera et al . , 2006 ) . Synaptojanin’s N - terminal sac1 - like inositol phosphatase domain ( Syja _ N ) can hydrolyse PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 to PI which induces the uncoating process ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . HSC70 has a low intrinsic ATPase activity which is stimulated by co - factor auxilin ( Higgins & McMahon , 2002 ) . The latter’s C - terminal DNAJ ( also known as Hsp40 ) domain recruits HSC70 to the clathrin coat and induces its uncoating activity ( Massol et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 3 . 7 ) . 111 Chapter 3 3 . 4 Discussion In this chapter I defined the system that mediates CME as the set of protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions known as the CME - I network . As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter , the important novelty of this version of CME - I network is incorporation of information regarding protein domain architecture and binding ability of specific motifs . This is missing in previous versions of clathrin interactome networks , but it ' s important in order to determine how the CME - I network evolved , from the LCEA to the mammalian and budding yeast cells . The CME - I model presented here will thus be used as the framework for the phylogenomic study reported in Chapter 4 , which will not only investigate the evolution of this endocytic process , but the origin and evolution of its distinct functions and sub - parts , and how they have become integrated to form CME ' as we know it ' . Another aim of this analysis is to provide an insight into how a complex eukaryotic cellular processes evolve , focusing on the importance of gene and whole genome duplication , gene fusion and protein domain rearrangements in driving the diversification of the endomembrane system and the cytoskeleton , as has been previously reported ( Dacks et al . , 2008 ; Richards & Cavalier - Smith , 2005 ; Wickstead et al . , 2010 ) . It should be noted that some CME - I network proteins are involved in more than one function . For instance , epsins share functional properties with other monomeric endocytic adaptors in CME as they bind clathrin , the AP2 complex , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and a specific cargo signal ( in epsin ' s case ubiquitinated protein signal ) ( Drake et al . , 2000 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ; Kazazic et al . , 2009 ) . They are thus classified as components of the 112 Chapter 3 113 Figure 3 . 7 Vesicle uncoating module of the CME - I network . a Synaptojanin , auxilin and HSC70 combine to mediate the detachment of the clathrin coat components from the vesicle . Coat components are then recycled back to the plasma membrane . b Connectivity diagram highlighting CME - I network components involved in the vesicle uncoating module . Network components involved in the vesicle uncoating module are in colour , other components are in grey . Chapter 3 CME - I core module . However , evidence shows they can also bend membranes with a mechanism that is similar to amphiphysin ( Ford et al . , 2002 ; Horvath et al . , 2007 ) . Other proteins such as amphiphysins , endophilin , TOCA - 1 , FBP17 and CIP4 are characterised as membrane bending proteins because of their N - terminal , crescent shaped BAR domains . However , their C - terminal SH3 domains , bind proline rich domain ( PRD ) in N - WASP , an interaction shown to induce actin polymerisation ( Yamada et al . , 2009 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ) , and the PRD in ' classical dynamins ' ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ) involved in vesicle scission . The functional classification outlined in this chapter should thus not be taken as a rigid and impermeable set of categories . Rather , the main purpose is to deconstruct the complexity of the CME - I network into manageable sub - parts . Another issue is the specificity of CME - I proteins to the CME pathway . As mentioned in the general introduction , proteins such as dynamin , SNX9 , N - WASP and amphiphysins are involved in other distinct endocytic pathways . In addition , some proteins , or at least paralogues of the proteins , play roles in completely separate cellular functions ( Table 3 . 2 summarises involvement of these proteins in non - CME endocytic pathways and in other cellular functions ) . Thus when considering the results of comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses , it should be noted that the presence of a specific protein does not necessarily mean it is involved in CME . Bioinformatics offers an important but nonetheless limited predictive tool , and involvement in CME can only be conclusively confirmed by cell biological data . A further limitation of the CME - I defined here is that it may not be complete . The way proteins were searched was by association with clathrin , the AP2 complex , dynamin and 114 Chapter 3 Table 3 . 2 List of CME proteins which also play roles in non - CME endocytic pathways and / or other cellular functions .

The model of the CME - I network presented here may thus be biased towards proteins that interact with clathrin and the AP2 complex . In addition , proteins involved in CME may have been characterised after thisstudy was carried out , or considered as potentially involved in CME but for paucity of evidence . For instance , in a previous analysis of the CME - I , proteins such as tom1 , NECAP - 1 and stonin2 were proposed as potential endocytic adaptors , ( see supplementary material in ( Schmid & McMahon , 2007 ) , but not enough evidence was available for inclusion in the CME - I network at the time when this project started . The CME - I network , and associated analyses , should therefore be regularly updated . 116 Chapter 4 4 Evolutionary history of the CME - I network 4 . 1 Introduction The molecular requirements of CME are mediated and coordinated by a complex set of protein - protein and lipid - protein interactions known as the CME interactome ( CME - I ) network ( Schmid & McMahon , 2007 ) . A total of 39 proteins , belonging to 21 gene families , were included in the known , functionally modulated CME - I network described in Chapter 3 ( Table 3 . 1 ) . In this chapter I present a phylogenomic study of the CME - I network . As mentioned in Chapter 3 , an important aim of this study is to investigate the evolutionary history of the complex molecular machinery required for viable CME in budding yeast and mammalian model organisms . This is particularly significant because this molecular machinery involves multiple modes of actin cytoskeleton regulation , and reconstructing the evolution of interactions between membrane deforming endocytic proteins with the actin cytoskeleton may provide clues concerning the evolution of the eukaryotic endomembrane system . The study will thus focus on patterns of modification and expansion in the evolution of the CME - I network . By identifying synapomorphies in the form of novel protein families , novel protein domain architectures and novel interactions between protein families , putative CME - I networks on different branches of the eukaryotic tree can be reconstructed and compared , thereby highlighting key events in the evolutionary history of CME . This study also aims to add further detail to the model of CME in the LCEA . Previously 117 Chapter 4 published , comparative genomic , phylogenetic and cell biological studies focusing on CME proteins such as clathrin , the AP2 complex , epsins , EPS15 , AP180 and dynamins , suggests that a significant part of the CME - I network was present in the LCEA ( Dacks et al . , 2008 ; Elde et al . , 2005 ; Field et al . , 2007 ; Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ; Miyagishima et al . , 2008 ; Schledzewski et al . , 1999 ) . However , the evolutionary histories of these protein families have been studied individually , without context of a protein interaction network . The data reported in this chapter will indicate if other proteins or protein domains which characterise the CME - I were likely to be present in the LCEA and will thus predict the organisation of the minimal set CME - I proteins in the ancestral CME - I network . Finally , the study aims to provide an estimation of the diversity of the CME pathway in a sample of distantly related , eukaryotic lineages . Cell biological studies of CME proteins are biased to opisthokont taxa . The main exceptions to this bias are studies on kinetoplastid protist Trypanosoma , where an advanced model of the functions and mechanism of CME is emerging ( Allen et al . , 2003 ; Chanez et al . , 2006 ; Correa et al . , 2007 ; Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ; Hung et al . , 2004 ; Morgan et al . , 2001 ; Morgan et al . , 2004 ) . There also notable studies of CME carried out on the ciliates Paramecium and Tetrahymena ( Elde et al . , 2005 ; Ramoino et al . , 2006 ; Wiejak et al . , 2004 ) , on apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii ( Nichols et al . , 1994 ) and the metamonad Giardia ( Hernandez et al . , 2007 ; Rivero et al . , 2010 ) . However , data from these studies only cover the role of clathrin , the AP2 complex , dynamins and epsins . Results presented in this chapter will be used to assess how conserved the rest of the CME - I network is in these diverse , non - opisthokont eukaryotic lineages as well as other protists such as 118 Chapter 4 metamonad Trichomonas , Discicristata Naegleria , heterokonts Thalassiosira and Phytophthora and haptophyte Emiliania . This will provide a broad map of CME diversity across eukaryotes . The experimental outline of this study consists in determining the taxonomic distribution of CME - I network components within a broad sample of diverse eukaryotes . Because paralogues often encode proteins with non - identical function ( Koonin , 2005 ) , the evolutionary relationships between network component and putative homologues , i . e . relation by vertical descent ( orthology ) , or relation by gene duplication ( paralogy ) , are qualified via phylogenetic analysis . To investigate the evolution of the CME functional repertoire , a protein domain analysis of CME - I network proteins and respective homologues is also carried out . The protein domain architectures of candidate homologues are then mapped to the phylogenies of the CME - I network protein families included in the study . Taken together , these data are used to reconstruct the evolution of the CME - I network . 4 . 2 Materials and methods 4 . 2 . 1 Identification of candidate CME - I protein homologues The amino acid sequences of the CME - I network proteins were downloaded from the Homo sapiens predicted proteome on SWISS - PROT ( M . Schneider et al . , 2009 ) . Using CME - I network proteins as seeds , BLASTp and tBLASTn searches were performed against a selection of diverse eukaryotic genome as described in sections 2 . 1 . 1 - 2 of the Materials and Methods chapter . A gathering threshold of < 1 x e - 5 was applied to the sequence similarity results . Sequences with significant sequence similarity were tested 119 Chapter 4 by reciprocal BLASTp searches . The protein domain architecture of putative homologues was predicted by searching the PFAM and CDD databases as described in section 2 . 1 . 3 . Sequences that featured at least partially identical protein domain structures to the query CME - I network protein were retained for further analyses . To ensure that the maximum number of candidate homologues were retrieved , for each database search , the sequence with the highest E - value among those found to be significantly similar in the first BLASTp or tBLASTn search , was selected as seed to perform a further BLASTp or tBLASTn search against the same database . To exclude false negative results in the database searches two methods were used . Firstly , BLASTp and tBLASTn searches were performed against databases producing negative results , using a candidate homologue from the most closely related organism sampled in the study , as seed ( For instance if a search for query sequence A indicates absence in Entamoeba histolytica , but presence in Dictyostelium discoideum , the A candidate homologue in Dictyostelium discoideum is selected as query sequence for a new search against the Entamoeba histolytica database ) . Secondly , a selection of predicted proteomes - one for each of the ten main eukaryotic groups sampled in this study - were searched using the PSI - BLAST programme ( Altschul et al . , 1997 ) and a given CME - I network protein as seed , thus creating a position specific substitution matrix ( PSSM ) . The PSSM was downloaded and used to perform PSI - BLAST searches against databases that produced negative results in the BLASTp and tBLASTn searches . Putative homologues found using the two methods described were analysed with PFAM and CDD and considered for further analysis in case of full or partial domain identity . 120 Chapter 4 4 . 2 . 2 Phylogenetic analyses of CME - I network protein families Data sets were prepared for phylogenetic analyses by carrying out multiple sequence alignments ( MSA ) , alignment masking , and substitution model selection , using the methods described in section 2 . 1 . 4 of the Materials and Methods chapter . A total of 21 data sets for 20 protein families ( the AP2α adaptin subunits and the AP2β adaptin subunits were analysed separately ) were created . For each data - set , fast amino acid maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed using RAXML and MRBAYES respectively , as described in section 2 . 1 . 5 . of Chapter 2 . For all analyses , the best - fitting RtRev amino acid substitution matrix was used . For RAXML analyses , the hard - coded G distribution setting with 4 rate categories was used . For MRBAYES analyse , a G distribution setting of 8 rate categories was used . RAXML bootstrap analyses were used to assess topological support for the phylogenies . For data sets with more than 100 sequences , 1 , 000 bootstrap replicate analyses were carried out , whereas for data sets containing less than 100 sequences , 100 bootstrap replicate analyses were carried out . This is because when using RAXML to do a combined ML tree search and bootstrap analysis , every fifth tree produced by the bootstrap replicates is used as starting tree for the ML topology search ( Stamatakis , 2006 ) . A higher number of bootstraps will thus improve the final tree in very large data - sets . For all MRBAYES analyses , a minimum of 1 ' 000 ' 000 MCMC generations were performed , except for data - sets with more than 100 sequences where 2 ' 500 ' 000 MCMC generations were performed . In all runs , trees were sampled every 100 generations . To determine posterior probabilities for bipartitions , trees with sub - optimal likelihood values were removed using the ' burnin ' function ( the number of trees removed was graphically determined by plotting the likelihood values ) , and the remaining tree sample was 121 Chapter 4 summarised using the ' sumt ' function . In this study , orthology and inparalogy between the query protein and a putative homologue is suggested only when maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis supports monophyly of the query protein and putative homologue with support values equal or higher than 80 / 0 . 90 . 4 . 2 . 3 Mapping CME - I network evolution to the eukaryotic tree of life For each sequence included in the 21 data sets prepared for phylogenetic analyses , the protein domain architecture was identified using PFAM ( Finn et al . , 2010 ) and mapped to the phylogenetic trees obtained in this study . The phylogenetic distribution of protein domain architectures , was used to pinpoint protein domains acquisition or paralogue - specific protein domain rearrangements . According to principles of evolution based on Dollo ' s law ( Le Quesne , 1974 ) , the acquisition of a complex character ( in this case a protein domain architecture ) is almost certainly a unique event , whereas a secondary reversal to a state of absence is by comparison far more probable . For protein domain architectures that distributed to a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic trees , a single origin was thus pinpointed to the last common ancestor of the taxa in the monophyletic group , even if it entailed secondary loss in a minority of the sequences in the monophyletic group . The taxonomic distribution of protein domain architectures in 15 strongly supported , monophyletic eukaryotic groups was thus determined . Using the Dollo based principle , this data was in turn used to map acquisition of protein domains and protein domain rearrangements on the model of the eukaryotic tree described in section 1 . 2 . 2 . Protein domain architectures present in few and distantly related taxa , and protein 122 Chapter 4 domain architectures that were mapped to phylogenetic trees with very poor resolution , were excluded from the eukaryotic map as further analyses were required to identify a likely origin , but not performed in this study . The likely origin for interactions between two CME components was pinpointed according to the approach described in Section 3 . 1 . This means that the acquisition of an interaction is pinpointed to the point of acquisition of the more derived of the two interacting proteins . The data on the origin of protein domains was combined with the data on origin of protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions to generate a model describing the probable CME - I network at different stages of eukaryotic evolution . 4 . 3 Results 4 . 3 . 1 Taxonomic distribution of CME - I proteins . An initial sequence similarity search was performed on GenBank non - redundant bacterial and archaeal databases ( Sayers et al . , 2010 ) . Only homologues of HSC70 and the DNAJ domain found at the C - terminal of auxilin proteins ( Holstein et al . , 1996 ) were found in prokaryotic genome databases . These belong to the heat shock protein family and operate as molecular chaperones in a range of functions outside of CME ( Chappell et al . , 1986 ; Walsh et al . , 2004 ) . Together , this confirms that CME is an eukaryotic cellular process . To study the taxonomic distribution of CME - I proteins I carried out similarity searches in 27 diverse eukaryotic predicted proteomes and translated nucleotide databases . For each protein family I collected sequences with significant similarity , aligned them , and conducted fast maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses . I thus obtained phylogenetic trees of clathrin heavy chains , clathrin light chains , AP α subunits , AP2β subunits , AP2μ subunits , AP2σ 123 Chapter 4 subunits , PTB proteins ( ARH , disabled 2 and numb ) , arrestins , AP180 / CALM , HIP1 / HIP1R , epsins , amphiphysins / endophilin , FCH proteins ( TOCA - 1 , FBP17 and CIP4 ) , tuba , SNX9 , dynamins , EH proteins ( EPS15 / EPS15R and intersectins ) , ABP1 , N - WASP , auxilins and synaptojanins ( Figures 4 . 3 - 23 ) . A characteristic found in all but the AP2μ , AP2σ and AP180 / CALM phylogenies is the presence of gene duplications specific to Homo sapiens and Danio rerio . This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that whole genome duplication events occurred close to the origin of vertebrates , before the radiation of jawed vertebrates ( Dehal & Boore , 2005 ; Kasahara , 2007 ) . The implication of this pattern is that for most of the CME - I proteins , orthologues can only be confirmed in Danio rerio while all sequences outside of the Homo sapiens / Danio rerio clade are conservatively defined as paralogues . I therefore distinguished paralogues related by ancient duplication from paralogues that are orthologous to the parent protein of the Homo sapiens / Danio rerio specific duplications by using terminology previously described by Koonin ( Annu . Rev . Genet . , 2005 ) . Distantly related paralogues are more likely to perform non - identical functions to the query protein and are referred to as outparalogues . Paralogues that are orthologous to the parent protein of Homo sapiens / Danio rerio - specific duplications are instead referred to here as inparalogues ( Figure 4 . 1 ) . Overall , the combined results from the homology searches and phylogenetic analyses suggest a mosaic pattern in the taxonomic distribution of CME - I network proteins ( Figures 4 . 2 - 23 ) . The results are thus divided according to distinct patterns of conservation in the eukaryotic genomes sampled . 124 Chapter 4 4 . 3 . 1 . 1 Conserved core CME - I protein network Database searches for clathrin heavy chain , AP2α and AP2β subunits revealed the presence of homologues with high sequence similarity in every taxon sampled ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . This suggests these key components of the core CME - I network are strongly conserved among eukaryotes . The phylogenetic analyses for the three protein families confirm the pattern of vertebrate specific gene duplications ( Figures 4 . 3 , 4 . 5 and 4 . 6 ) . This entails true orthology to the respective query proteins can only be confirmed for homologues found in Danio rerio . For clathrin heavy chain and AP2β subunits , the phylogenetic analyses suggests that in all non - vertebrate taxa sampled , inparalogues are present , although for AP2β it is weakly supported ( Figures 4 . 3 and 4 . 6 ) . The AP2α 125 Figure 4 . 1 Distinction of inparalogues from outparalogues when assessing homology to query protein . The schematic tree depicts hypothetical CME - I protein phylogeny with typical pattern of vertebrate specific duplication . True orthologues are related by vertical descent ( shown in red ) ; type A paralogues are homologues that are orthologous with parent protein of vertebrate specific duplication ( shown in blue ) ; type B paralogues are homologues related by ancient duplication ( shown in yellow ) . Chapter 4 phylogeny suggests that in all non - vertebrate taxa sampled , except Trypanosoma brucei and Cyanidioschyzon merolae , inparalogues are present . The AP2α homologues found in Trypanosoma brucei and Cyanidioschyzon merolae are outparalogues ( i . e . related by ancient duplication ) ( Figure 4 . 5 ) . In the phylogeny , the three AP2α Trypanosoma homologues are AP1γ , AP3δ subunits and AP4ε , the two AP2α Cyanidioschyzon homologues are AP1γ and AP3δ subunits ( Figure 4 . 5 ) . Homologues to the AP2μ and AP2σ subunits were also found in all taxa sampled in the phylogenomic study ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . However , the phylogenies for the two protein families did not show vertebrate specific duplications found in the other two AP2 subunits ( Figures 4 . 7 and 4 . 8 ) . Orthology was confirmed for holozoan AP2μ homologues . For the rest of the sampled taxa weakly supported inparalogy was indicated except for Trypanosoma brucei and Cyanidioschyzon merolae where outparalogy was indicated . Out of the three AP2μ outparalogues found in Trypanosoma brucei , one is in the AP1μ clade , one is in the AP3μ clade and one is in the AP4μ clade . The Cyanidioschyzon merolae AP2μ outparalogue is in the AP3μ clade ( Figure 4 . 7 ) . Strongly supported orthology was confirmed for holozoan AP2σ homologues . For the rest of the sampled taxa weakly supported inparalogy was indicated except for Ustilago maydis , Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , Trypanosoma brucei and Cyanidioschyzon merolae where outparalogy was indicated ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . The AP2σ outparalogues found in these four taxa group within the AP1σ and the AP3σ clades except for the Trypanosoma brucei which are present in the AP1σ , AP3σ and AP4σ clades ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . Clathrin light chain homologues were found in all sampled taxa except Entamoeba 126 Chapter 4 127 Figure 4 . 2 Taxonomic distribution of CME - I network proteins .

However , it should be noted that in Chlamydomonas , alveolates , heterokonts , Emiliania and Trypanosoma brucei , clathrin light homologues were found with the PSI - BLAST strategy explained in Section 4 . 2 . 1 , and only very weak sequence similarity was detected . The clathrin light chain protein sequence is relatively small ( ~ 200 - 250 amino acids ) and poorly conserved ( Figure 4 . 4 ) . It is possible that the clathrin light chain , in the three taxa where it was not found , is too divergent to be detected even with PSI - BLAST . Together , this data indicates that clathrin , the main structural component of CME vesicle coats , is highly conserved across eukaryotic diversity and that the four AP complexes evolved prior to the diversification of eukaryotes , except for AP1β and AP2β which evolved during eukaryote diversification . These are not however novel findings . Conservation of clathrin across eukaryotic diversity has already been reported ( Field et al . , 2007 ) . The evolutionary pattern of AP complexes was first suggested by phylogenies including a small sample of diverse eukaryotes ( Elde et al . , 2005 ; Schledzewski et al . , 1999 ) , and then conclusively demonstrated with a more broadly sampled , and phylogenetically more robust analysis ( Dacks et al . , 2008 ) . Recently , a fifth AP complex was discovered , and the likely branching order of the five AP complexes determined ( Hirst et al . , 2011 ) The data also suggests the AP2 complex is highly conserved in the eukaryotes , but that it is absent in Trypanosoma brucei and Cyanidioschyzon merolae . This finding has also been previously reported ( Dacks et al . , 2008 ; Field et al . , 2007 ; Morgan et al . , 2001 ) . A final result to consider is absence of the AP2σ subunit in Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Ustilago maydis . Given the unquestionable ancient origin of the four AP complexes , these absences must be due to 128 Chapter 4 secondary loss . 129 Figure 4 . 3 Phylogenetic tree of clathrin heavy chain . Box highlights query protein . For this and all other phylogenetic trees presented in this chapter , maximum likelihood and Bayesian MCMC analyses were run on multiple sequence alignment data - set of the protein sequences , and putative protein domain structures were calculated by searching HMMs database PFAM .

Chapter 4 4 . 3 . 1 . 2 Epsins , dynamins , SNX9 , synaptojanins , auxilin and EPS15 / EPS15R / intersectins are conserved but have complex evolutionary histories The epsins , dynamins , SNX9 and synaptojanins have complex phylogenetic patterns . For the four protein families , homologues were found in all the taxa sampled . However , respective phylogenetic analyses suggest gene duplications and / or protein domain rearrangements have resulted in multiple and divergent paralogous protein forms which have diversified across the eukaryotic phylogeny ( Figures 4 . 9 , 4 . 10 , 4 . 11 and 4 . 12 ) . All four protein families are characterised by at least one ancient gene duplication , and it is likely that distantly related paralogues evolved non - identical functions to the query proteins . They all share the same pattern of vertebrate specific duplications which means orthology could only be confirmed in Danio rerio , so here I concentrate on the taxonomic distribution of inparalogues to assess the possibility that CME variants of these protein families are present in the taxa sampled . According to the epsins phylogeny , inparalogues are confirmed for homologues found in non - vertebrate opisthokont taxa , but not with strong statistical support ( Figure 4 . 9 ) . All other homologues were conservatively defined as outparalogues . This result is consistent with the only other published eukaryotic wide phylogeny of the epsins ( Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) . In synaptojanins ( Figure 4 . 10 ) , inparalogy is strongly supported for homologues present in non - vertebrate metazoan taxa , and weakly supported for Monosiga brevicollis and , interestingly , Emiliania huxleyi . All other synaptojanin homologues were conservatively defined as outparalogues . The dynamins are known to be diverse and carry several distinct functions within the cell ( Praefcke & McMahon , 2004 ) , so it is important for this study to pinpoint the putative origin of the endocytic variant . This study strongly supports presence of inparalogues in metazoan and 135 Chapter 4 choanoflagellate taxa ( together known as Holozoa , Lang et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure 4 . 11 ) which suggests the dynamin paralogue has its origin at the root of the Holozoa . This is a novel finding given that the two prior phylogenetic eukaryotic - wide studies of dynamins did not sample Monosiga brevicollis , or other closely related choanozoans in the analyses ( Elde et al . , 2005 ; Miyagishima et al . , 2008 ) . Similarly to dynamins , SNX9 belongs to a wider group of proteins known as sorting nexins , which are employed in a variety of putative functions within membrane trafficking and protein sorting ( Seet & Hong , 2006 ; Worby & Dixon , 2002 ) . The SNX9 phylogeny also suggests inparalogues are present in the holozoan taxa sampled , but only with weak statistical support ( Figure 4 . 12 ) . The origin of the SNX9 endocytic paralogue could thus be pinpointed at the root of the Holozoa , but with low confidence . Auxilin features an N - terminal domain which is homologous to the PTEN phosphatase and can act on phosphoinositides such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( Lee et al . , 1999 ) . It also feature a C - terminal DNAJ domain . Homologues to at least part of the protein were found in all the taxa sampled , but the phylogenetic tree was based on the alignment of the PTEN _ C2 domain because it is the most conserved section of the protein . The auxilin phylogeny confirms the presence of orthologues in Danio rerio , and inparalogues in Nematostella vectensis and Drosophila melanogaster but not in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Figure 4 . 13 ) . This data suggests the auxilin lineage originated at the root of the Metazoa . The analyses on the EPS15 / EPS15R and intersectin protein families point towards a similar evolutionary history to epsins , synaptojanins , SNX9 and dynamins but for the following reasons : for taxa outside of Holozoa , the homology hits are very weak and 136 Chapter 4 based on the eukaryotic universal Ef Hand ( EH ) functional domain which is very short ( ~ 60 amino acids ) and repeated across the N - terminals of EPS15 / EPS15R and intersectins . In addition , in the intersectins the EH domains represent roughly a fifth of the total functional repertoire of the protein , which is fully conserved only in Homo sapiens and Danio rerio , and partially conserved in the rest of the metazoans sampled . While multiple duplication and protein domain recombinations have occurred , the paucity of conserved characters for a global alignment means the phylogeny is poorly resolved and the origin of the endocytic variants can not be pinpointed with confidence ( Figure 4 . 14 ) . 4 . 3 . 1 . 3 Evolutionary distribution of ABP1 , N - WASP and AP180 / CALM ABP1 and N - WASP belong to large and diverse protein families which are involved in a range of actin - related cellular functions . ABP1 belongs to the ADF / cofilin family which mediates actin depolymerisation ( Bernstein & Bamburg , 2010 ) . In the genomic searches more than 180 ADF / cofilin proteins were identified , and an initial phylogenetic tree was produced to identify the section of the tree with ABP1 ( data not shown ) . The ABP1 data sub - set was then used for a further phylogeny . Although it is overall poorly resolved , the resulting tree highlights the typical vertebrate - specific gene duplication and suggests that ABP1 may be specific to unikonts ( Figure 4 . 15 ) . However , the statistical support for the unikont clade is weak ( - / 0 . 67 ) . Notably , outparalogues of ABP1 were found in all sampled taxa except for Giardia lamblia . N - WASP belongs to the WASP / WAVE family which mediates actin nucleation in different cell processes ( Pollitt & Insall , 2009 ) . Similarly to the ABP1 analysis , an initial global phylogeny was used to identify the section of the tree where N - WASP branched . A full analysis of the N - WASP sub - set 137 Chapter 4 138 Figure 4 . 9 Phylogenetic tree of epsins . The phylogeny suggests the three human epsins are the result of typical vertebrate - specific gene duplications . It provides strong support for inparalogy in Holozoa and weak support for inparalogy in Fungi . It also suggests an opisthokont origin of the ENTH - UIM domain structure , but with moderate statistical support ( 66 / 1 ) . The phylogeny is poorly resolved at the deep branching level , indicating possible an ancient gene duplication during eukaryote diversification . Chapter 4 139 Figure 4 . 10 Phylogenetic tree of synaptojanins . Analyses were based on the alignment of the N - terminal Syja _ N domain . The Giardia lamblia GL50803 _ 8589 homologue was removed due to long branch . Overall the phylogeny is poorly resolved , especially at deep branching level . Metazoan and fungal synaptojanin groups are resolved but opisthokont monophyly is not supported statistically ( - / 0 . 67 ) . This may be due to the unusual branching position of the two Emiliania huxleyi homologues ( 227496 and 465507 ) as sister to the Holozoa . The phylogenetic distribution of the Syja _ N - Exo _ endo _ phos domain structure is limited to opisthokonts , Dictyostelium , alvoelates and the haptophyte . The phylogeny suggests that deep level gene duplications are likely to have occurred . Chapter 4 140 Figure 4 . 11 Phylogenetic tree of dynamins . To reduce computational demand the 11 Paramecium tetraurelia and 8 Trichomonas vaginalis dynamin homologues were excluded from the analysis . The holozoan clade comprising the ' classical ' dynamins is well supported ( 100 / 1 ) , although its revolutionary relationship with other dynamins lineages is unresolved . The phylogeny suggests deep - level gene duplications have occurred but it is inconclusive as to the branching order of distantly related paralogues . The protein domain architecture of endocytic dynamins is specific to holozoa , although interestingly two Arabidopsis thaliana homologues ( NP _ 172500 and NP _ 176170 ) are predicted to have a PH domain that is otherwise specific to ' classical ' dynamins . Chapter 4 141 Figure 4 . 12 Phylogenetic tree of SNX9 . The Plasmodium falciparum XP _ 001349109 homologue was removed from analysis due to long branch . The phylogeny indicates that multple vertebrate - specific gene duplications produced SNX9 , with inparalogy confirmed for other metazoan and Monosiga brevicollis with weak to moderate statistical support . As for epsins , synaptojanins and dynamins , phylogenetic analysis suggests a complex evolutionary history with deep - level gene duplications , but the tree overall lacks resolution . The SH3 - PX - BAR _ 3 _ WASP domain structure appears to be specific to Holozoa , although a Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis homologue ( BDEG _ 01032 ) and a Ustilago maydis homologue ( XP _ 758695 ) feature the same protein domains albeit in much larger protein sizes . Chapter 4 142 Figure 4 . 13 Phylogenetic tree of auxilin . The tree is based on the alignment of the central PTEN _ C2 homology domain . The domain is missing in the Fungi , Apicomplexa , Cyanidioschyzon merolae , Trypanosoma brucei and Giardia lamblia which are thus not featured in this analysis . Ostreococcus tauri XP _ 003080200 long branch homologoue was removed . The auxilin clade is clearly resolved but it only includes Metazoa minus Caenorhabditis elegans , for which the PTEN _ C2 - DNAJ protein could not be found . Chapter 4 143 Chapter 4 again resulted in a poorly resolved tree where robust statistical support was only found for vertebrate clades ( Figure 4 . 16 ) . Notably , the N - WASP section of the WASP / WAVE tree , did not include Archaeplastida , heterokonts , apicomplexa , Entamoeba histolytica , Emiliania huxleyi , Trypanosoma brucei and Giardia lamblia , suggesting secondary loss of the ancient paralogue from which N - WASP evolved . Secondary loss was also suggested by results of the AP180 / CALM analysis . As previously reported , homologues were not found in Entamoeba , alveolates , heterokonts and metamonads ( Field et al . , 2007 ) . However , a previously unreported Emiliania huxleyi ( JGI acc . n . 454329 ) predicted protein with a short N - terminal ANTH domain was found . The phylogeny indicates that A180 and CALM are the result of a vertebrate specific gene duplication . Interestingly , as many as 8 Arabidopsis specific gene duplications were also indicated ( Figure 4 . 17 ) . 4 . 3 . 1 . 4 HIP1 / HIP1R , amphiphysins , endophilin and FCH are unikont - specific The analyses of the HIP1 / HIP1R , amphiphysins , endophilin and TOCA - 1 / FBP - 17 / CIP4 proteins produced similar results . For all these proteins , homologues were only found in unikont taxa , and vertebrate - specific gene duplications were indicated by respective phylogenies ( Figure 4 . 18 - 20 ) . HIP1 / HIP1R proteins feature an N - terminal conserved domain which is similar to the ANTH domain in AP180 / CALM protein family . However , the sequence similarity between the two ANTH domains is very weak and 144 ( previous page ) Figure 4 . 14 Phylogenetic tree of EPS15 , EPS15R and intersectins . The phylogeny is mostly unresolved and support values are low even for established clades . This is due to the paucity of conserved characters available ( 125 for an alignment of 101 sequences ) when aligning the EH domains . However it still highlights the vertebrate - specific duplications which produced EPS15 and EPS15R , and the two intersectins . Chapter 4 145 Figure 4 . 16 Phylogenetic tree of N - WASP . The analysis is based on the alignment of the WH1 protein domain . Tree represents the sub - branch comprising N - WASP and representative outgroup species . Overall poor resolution of the tree means analysis is inconclusive as to origin of the N - WASP paralogue . Figure 4 . 15 . Phylogenetic tree of ABP1 . The analysis is based on the alignment of the ADF / cofilin protein domain . Tree represents the sub - branch of the ADF / cofilin protein family comprising ABP1 and representative outgroup species . Analysis suggests ABP1 are specific to unikonts , although the finding is weakly supported . The ADF - SH3 domain distributes to unikonts . Chapter 4 insufficient to carry out a phylogenetic analysis sampling both protein families . HIP1 / HIP1R proteins were thus analysed separately . Overall the HIP1 / HIP1R phylogeny constitutes a strongly supported and well resolved unikont phylogeny ( Figure 4 . 18 ) . Amphiphysins and endophilin were analysed together as they share the same protein domain structure and a sufficient degree of sequence similarity for an inclusive multiple sequence alignment . The phylogeny suggests , albeit with weak statistical support , that an ancestral amphiphysin / endophilin gene duplicated prior to the 146 Figure 4 . 17 Phylogenetic tree of AP180 and CALM . Phylogeny highlights vertebrate - specific gene duplications which produced AP180 and CALM , although the AP180 clade is weakly supported . Several Arabidopsis thaliana - specific duplications are also indicated Chapter 4 diversification of metazoans from Fungi , producing the two sub - families ( Figure 4 . 19 ) . Within the endophilins , further duplications occurred at the base of the metazoans and of the vertebrates , while the endophilin gene was independently lost in fungal taxa Ustilago maydis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Within the amphiphysins there was a fungal specific duplication in addition to the vertebrate - specific duplication . These duplications receive moderate support values in the phylogeny ( Figure 4 . 19 ) . For both the endophilin and amphiphysin clades , inparalogues were confirmed for homologues in non - vertebrate opisthokonts , whereas the clade comprising amoebozoans Dictyostelium discoideum and Entamoeba histolytica was defined as an outparalogue group . The phylogenetic tree of FCH proteins is not as robustly resolved as the amphiphysin / endophilin tree ( Figure 4 . 20 ) . Therefore , while highlighting the vertebrate specific gene duplications which produced TOCA - 1 , FBP17 and CIP4 , the analysis did not resolve deep - level evolutionary relationships . Inparalogues could only be confirmed for holozoan taxa whereas other non - holozoan homologues were conservatively defined as outparalogues . 4 . 3 . 1 . 5 Taxonomic distribution of tuba , β - arrestins and PTB proteins Tuba is a protein characterised by a central RhoGEF - BAR protein domain core , surrounded by SH3 domains at the N - and C - terminal . Homologues were only found in the opisthokonts , although the SH3 domains are absent in the Fungi sampled . The gene encoding tuba was not found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster , which is likely due to secondary loss ( Figure 4 . 21 ) . Homologues of β arrestins and the ARH / disabled 2 / numb group , were only found in the holozoan taxa sampled in this study ( Figure 4 . 2 ) .

( previous page ) Figure 4 . 19 Phylogenetic tree of amphiphysins and endophilin . A Monosiga brevicollis putative homologue ( 34505 in JGI ) was discarded because of long branch . The tree was rooted with amoebozoan sequences , producing a topology which suggests amphiphysin and endophilin arose as a result of a gene duplication at the root of the opisthokonts . It also indicates , with moderate statistical support , that there was a holozoa - specific endophilin duplication and a fungal - specific amphiphysin duplication . Chapter 4 sapiens / Danio rerio specific duplications and three Drosophila melanogaster specific duplications . In the phylogeny , the β arrestins homologue from Mus musculus were added to help define the four vertebrate paralogues ( Figure 4 . 22 ) . ARH , disabled 2 and numb belong to the protein family characterised by the phospholipid binding PTB domain . Phylogenetic analyses of a diverse sample of PTB proteins suggests that the disabled 2 and the numb paralogues arose at the base of the Metazoa , while the ARH lineage arose in vertebrates . The branching position of the six Monosiga brevicollis PTB homologues suggests they are outparalogues of all three query proteins ( Figure 4 . 23 ) . 4 . 3 . 2 Evolution of the CME - I functional repertoire The phylogenomic study presented in section 4 . 3 . 1 focused on the presence or absence of homologous genes in a selection of diverse eukaryotic predicted proteomes . The study was complicated by multiple gene duplications and the presence of diverse paralogues which may mediate different functions ( Koonin , 2005 ) . The apparently straightforward question " is protein A encoded in genome X ? " should thus be amended to " is an orthologue of protein A is encoded in genome X ? " and if a paralogue is identified , a further question is added : " what is the evolutionary relationship between the two paralogues ? " Figure 4 . 2 summarises database searching and the phylogenetic analyses carried out to answer these questions . Another approach is changing the question from " is protein A encoded by genome X ? " to " is the function associated with protein A encoded by genome X ? " . This logic is effective because it circumvents the issues of multiple paralogues . By studying the phylogenetic distribution of protein domain architectures , it is possible to pinpoint the 150 Chapter 4 151 Figure 4 . 21 Phylogenetic tree of tuba . The phylogeny is strongly supported and suggests the characteristic SH3 domains at either terminal of tuba were a holozoan innovation . Note that tuba was not found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster . Figure 4 . 22 Phylogenetic tree of β - arrestins . The Mus musculus homologues of β - arrestins were included to help resolve clades which resulted from three verterbate - specific gene duplications . Note also three possible Drosophila melanogaster - specific gene duplications . Chapter 4 putative origin of a protein domain or of a protein domain rearrangement , based on fundamental assumptions regarding the evolution of complex characters ( Le Quesne , 1974 ) . For instance , ABP1 has an N - terminal actin de - polymerisation factor ( ADF ) domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain . Since all predicted proteomes we sampled feature at least one protein with the ADF domain ( except for Giardia ) but the ADF - SH3 152 Figure 4 . 23 Phylogenetic tree of ARH , disabled - 2 and numb . The results from the phylogenetic analyses robustly support a metazoan origin of disabled - 2 and numb , and a verterbrate origin of ARH . Deep - level branching order is poorly resolved . The six Monosiga brevicollis sequences are conservatively classified as outparalogues of the query proteins . Chapter 4 protein domain architecture phylogenetically distributes only to a monophyletic group consisting of unikonts , ADF is predicted to be eukaryotic cenancestral ( present in the LCEA ) domain but that ADF - SH3 is a shared derived character of the unikonts . A model for the origin of protein domains architectures involved in CME was thus created . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 Mapping protein domain architectures of the CME - I network to the eukaryotic tree of life For a section of the CME - I network , it was uncomplicated to predict likely origin of protein domain architectures . This is because , for most of these protein families , a single , typical protein domain architecture was conserved in all the sequences sampled for the phylogenetic analyses , or , if variation in protein domain architecture was detected , it was minor and distributed to clades with high statistical support . This was found for clathrin heavy and light chain , the four AP2 subunits , β arrestins , PTB proteins ( ARH , disabled 2 and numb ) , the AP180 / CALM family , the HIP1 / HIP1R family , epsins , N - BAR proteins ( amphiphysins and endophilin ) and FCH proteins ( TOCA - 1 , FBP17 and CIP4 ) ( see Figures 4 . 3 - 9 , 4 . 17 - 20 , 4 . 22 and 4 . 23 ) . For the rest of the CME - I network , the phylogenetic distribution of protein domain architectures suggests major protein domain rearrangements have occurred . These may include gene fusions , protein domain losses , and re - shuffling of protein domain combinations . In some cases , the unique protein domain architectures do not distribute to monophyletic groups with support . Here , the evidence on the evolution of these protein families is analysed to assess whether these protein domain rearrangement 153 Chapter 4 events can be mapped on the eukaryotic phylogeny . 4 . 3 . 2 . 2 Evolution of protein domain architectures in epsins , SNX9 , dynamins and synaptojanins The epsins , SNX9 , dynamin and synaptojanin phylogenomic studies all described complex evolutionary histories characterised by multiple gene duplications and protein domain recombinations ( Figure 4 . 9 - 12 ) . The ENTH domain of the epsins was found in all the genomes sampled , which suggests it was acquired in the LCEA . However , in Metazoa and Fungi , an N - terminal ENTH domain was accompanied by a C - terminal ubiquitin interaction motif ( UIM ) ( Figure 4 . 9 ) . This suggests the ENTH - UIM combination was acquired in the last common opisthokont ancestor ( LCOA ) ( Figure 4 . 9 ) . Together , these results confirm previously reported data on the evolution of epsins ( Field et al . , 2007 ; Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) . The SNX9 protein is characterised by the following protein domain structure : an N - terminal SH3 domain which interacts with the PRDs of endocytic dynamins and N - WASP ( Shin et al . , 2007 ) , and a C - terminal combination of a phosphoinositide binding PX and a BAR - related domain ( known as BAR _ 3 _ WASP in PFAM and as BAR _ SNX9 in CDD ) , which together mediate membrane remodelling in the late stages of CME ( Pylypenko et al . , 2007 ) . This protein domain combination is present in all holozoan taxa sampled as well as fungal taxa Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Ustilago maydis ( Figure 4 . 12 ) . The SNX9 phylogeny is poorly resolved and does not support monophyly of proteins containing this domain structure ( Figure 4 . 12 ) but it is based on the global alignment of the small sized PX domain ( ~ 90 amino acids ) which means the 154 Chapter 4 evolutionary signal in the data - set is limited . However , under Dollo parsimony , the best interpretation of this gene family distribution data is that the SH3 - PX - BAR domain was acquired in the LCOA and then lost in the ascomycete Fungi sampled ( Figure 4 . 24 ) . The dynamin paralogues which are experimentally shown to be involved in the vesicle scission module of CME are frequently referred to in the literature as ' classical dynamins ' ( Praefcke & McMahon , 2004 ) . These dynamins are distinguished from other dynamin sub - families such as dynamin - like or dynamin - related proteins , Mx proteins , profusions and guanylate - binding proteins which cover a variety of cellular functions including mitochondrial division , cytokinesis and pathogen resistance ( Praefcke & McMahon , 2004 ) . The domain structure that characterises ' classical dynamins ' consists of an N - terminal GTPase domain ( known in PFAM as ' Dynamin _ N ' ) , a middle Dynamin _ M domain followed by the phosphoinositide binding PH domain , the GTPase effector domain ( GED ) and finally a C - terminal proline rich domain ( PRD ) ( Praefcke & McMahon , 2004 ) . PRDs are not included in the CDD or PFAM databases , but they are recognisable by high proline content . In this study , PRDs are assigned to protein regions with proline contents equal or higher than 25 % . The protein domain analysis of the dynamin homologues indicates that the Dynamin _ N - Dynamin _ M - GED domain combination is present in all the eukaryotic taxa . In contrast , the presence of a PH domain between the Dynamin _ M and GED domains is specific to metazoans , choanoflagellates , and two Arabidopsis thaliana sequences ( NP _ 172500 and NP _ 176170 , Figure 4 . 11 ) . Finally , the PRDs , which are instrumental in mediating interactions with endocytic proteins such as amphiphysins , tuba , SNX9 and ABP1 are only present in choanoflagellates and metazoan organisms . The complete domain 155 Chapter 4 structures of classical dynamins are therefore present only in choanoflagellates and metazoans , which suggests it was acquired in the last common holozoan ancestor ( LCHA ) ( Figure 4 . 24 ) . It is interesting to note that land plants feature the PH domain between the Dynamin _ M and GED domains , a feature otherwise unique to holozoans dynamins and absent in every other taxon sampled including green and red algae . The dynamin phylogeny does not support monophyly of the two Arabidopsis thaliana sequences with the holozoan homologues ( Figure 4 . 11 ) although the relationship of classical dynamins with its sister clade is poorly resolved . The evidence concerning the origin of the Arabidopsis PH domain is inconclusive . Synaptojanins have two inositol phosphatase domains : the N - terminal ' Syja _ N ' domain which can hydrolyse phosphoinositides PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 4 ) P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 to PI in vitro ( Guo et al . , 1999 ) , and the central ' Exo _ endo _ phos ' domain which hydrolyses PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . The analysis of these domains show that every organism considered in this study includes in its genome at least one gene that encodes a protein with the Syna _ N domain and at least one gene that encodes a protein with the Exo _ endo _ phos domain . However , the combination of the two domains is not universal . Indeed , the analyses show that it is present only in opisthokonts , Dictyostelium discoideum and alveolates ( Figure 4 . 10 ) . This phylogenetic distribution can be explained by a horizontal gene transfer between opisthokonts and alveolates , by homoplasy , or by multiple gene loss in Archaeplastida , metamonads , discicristatae , heterokontophytes and haptophytes . The phylogenetic analysis of synaptojanins is poorly resolved at deep nodes and does not support any of the three evolutionary scenarios ( Figure 4 . 10 ) . 156 Chapter 4 4 . 3 . 2 . 3 Evolution of the EPS15 / EPS15R and intersectin protein domain architectures EPS15 and EPS15R feature three N - terminal repetitions of the EH protein domain . Results show that this trait is found in predicted proteomes in a wide diversity of eukaryotes , and every predicted proteome searched includes at least one protein with at least one EH domain suggesting it is eukaryotic cenancestral feature . Intersectins share the N - terminal EH domain repetitions of EPS15 and EPS15R but have additional structural features representative of a composite functional repertoire . These consist of a central repetition of 5 SH3 domains and a C - terminal domain complex , made up of a RhoGEF ( also known as Dbl Homology ) , a PH domain and a C2 domain , which suggests a role as a guanine exchange factor ( GEF ) for Rho - like GTPases ( Pucharcos et al . , 2000 ) . The full intersectin domain architecture is present only in Homo sapiens and Danio rerio ( Figure 4 . 14 ) . In the rest of the metazoan taxa intersectins do not feature the C - terminal GEF complex . Interestingly , in the fungal species Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Ustilago maydis proteins were found with domain structures featuring two N - terminal EH domains , two central SH3 domains , and a C - terminal RhoGEF - PH domain complex ( in Batrachochytrium the PH domain is not present ) . In ascomycete fungi , choanoflagellates , and the rest of the eukaryotic taxa sampled in this study , intersectin specific structural features are absent ( Figure 4 . 14 ) . This suggests that the intersectin protein domain architecture was acquired in the LCOA , with secondary loss of the SH3 domains and GEF unit in choanoflagellates and ascomycetes fungi , and secondary loss of the GEF unit in invertebrate metazoans . However , the phylogenetic tree of intersectins is poorly resolved , so these putative protein domain rearrangements 157 Chapter 4 cannot be mapped on the eukaryotic tree with confidence . 4 . 3 . 2 . 4 Evolution of N - WASP and auxilin protein domain architectures The protein domain architecture of N - WASP consists in three protein domains recognised by PFAM and CDD : an N - terminal WASP homology 1 ( WH1 ) domain ( also 158 Figure 4 . 24 Putative origin of the CME protein domain repertoire . The acquisition of protein domain is mapped to a schematic model of the eukaryotic tree of life based on current consensus and includes 10 major phyla . Green bars represent putative acquisition of novel protein domains , teal bars represent putative acquitision of a novel protein domain combination , and red bars represent putative loss of ancient protein domains . Chapter 4 known as EVH1 ) which is bound by WASP interacting proteins ( WIPs ) to stabilise conformation during inactivity ( Svitkina , 2007 ) , a central P21 - Rho - binding ( PBD ) domain ( also known as CRIB ) which binds Cdc42 or Rho - like small GTPases ( G . Thompson et al . , 1998 ) , and two C - terminal WASP homology 2 ( WH2 ) domains , which are in fact very short conserved motifs , made of approximately 18 amino acid , which bind to actin monomers and to the end of polymerising actin filaments ( Co et al . , 2007 ) . The combination of the three functional units was found in the metazoan and the choanoflagellate taxa , in chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , in amoebozoan Dictyostelium discoideum and in ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila even though for the latter the domain recognition of PBD and WH2 were statistically very weak in PFAM ( E - values respectively of 0 . 28 and 0 . 027 ) and not detected in CDD . In addition , the combination of WH1 and PBD domains was found in basidiomycete Ustilago maydis and heterolobosean Naegleria gruberi . Finally the WH1 domain was found on its own in ascomycetes taxa , in Paramecium tetraurelia and Trichomonas vaginalis . These data show that , outside the holozoan clade , the taxonomic distribution of the three N - WASP functional domains is sparse and mostly absent . However , because of the size of the WH2 and the PBD domains ( ~ 18 amino acids and ~ 40 amino acids respectively ) , it is difficult to recognise them with HMMs or PSSMs , even in closely related homologous sequences , so in those genomes where a solitary WH1 domain was detected , these regions of the gene may have simply diverged enough not to be recognised by domain recognition tools . Nonetheless , the origin of the N - WASP protein domain architecture could not be pinpointed because of the its sparse phylogenetic distribution of , and the weak topological support in the N - WASP phylogenetic tree . 159 Chapter 4 Auxilin has an N - terminal regions with high similarity to the phosphatase and C2 domain of the PTEN gene . This protein domain is identified in PFAM and CDD as PTEN _ C2 , and is necessary for binding to phosphoinositides ( Massol et al . , 2006 ) . The DNAJ protein domain at the C - terminal of auxilin , is of prokaryotic origin and interacts with HSC70 to mediate the uncoating of clathrin coated vesicles ( Lemmon , 2001 ) . The PTEN - like domain is present in Metazoa , choanoflagellates , Ustilago maydis , Magnaporthe oryzae , amoebozoans , Viridiplantae , ciliates , Toxoplasma gondii , heterokonts , haptophytes , Naegleria gruberi and metamonads ( Figure 4 . 13 ) which suggests it was encoded by a gene in the LCEA ( Figure 4 . 24 ) . However , the combination of the PTEN - like domains and DNAJ is only present in Homo sapiens , Danio rerio , Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans . 4 . 3 . 2 . 5 Mapping expansion of the CME functional repertoire to the eukaryotic tree of life The putative origins of most of the protein domain and protein domain combinations that mediate the functions necessary for CME were mapped to a consensus eukaryotic tree of life ( Figure 4 . 24 ) demonstrating five steps in the evolution of CME complexity . The five steps are summarised : 1 ) Clathrin _ propel _ beta - Linker - Clathrin _ alpha ( present in clathrin heavy chain ) , Clathrin _ lg _ ch ( clathrin light chain ) , Adaptin _ N - α _ adaptinC2 - α _ adaptinC ( AP2 α subunit ) , Adaptin _ N - α _ adaptinC2 - β2 _ adaptinC ( AP2 β subunit ) , Adapt _ comp _ sub ( AP2 μ subunit ) , Clat _ adaptor _ σ ( AP2 σ subunit ) , ANTH ( AP180 / CALM ) , ENTH ( epsins ) , PX ( SNX9 ) , Dynamin _ N - Dynamin _ M - GED ( dynamins ) , EH ( EPS15 / EPS15 160 Chapter 4 & intersectins ) , ADF ( ABP1 ) , Syna _ N ( synaptojanins ) , Exo _ endo _ phos ( synaptojanins ) and PTEN _ C2 ( auxilin ) were acquired in the LCEA . 2 ) BAR - SH3 ( amphiphysins and endophilins ) , FCH - SH3 ( TOCA - 1 / FBP17 / CIP4 ) , ADF - SH3 ( ABP1 ) and ANTH - ILWEQ ( HIP1 / HIP1R ) were acquired in the LCUA . 3 ) ENTH - UIM ( epsins ) , RhoGEF - BAR ( tuba ) and SH3 - PX - BAR ( SNX9 ) , were acquired in the LCOA . 4 ) Arrestin _ N & Arrestin _ C ( β arrestins ) , PTB ( ARH , numb and disabled - 2 ) , Dynamin _ N - Dynamin _ M - PH - GEF - PRD ( dynamin 1 / 2 / 3 ) , SH3 - RhoGEF - BAR - SH3 ( tuba ) were acquired in the LCHA . 5 ) Finally , the PTEN _ C2 - DNAJ domain combination was acquired in the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens , Danio rerio , Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans . The putative origins of the EH - SH3 - RhoGEF - PH - C2 structure of intersectins , the WH1 - PBD - WH2 structure of N - WASP and the Syja _ N - Exo _ endo _ phos structure of synaptojanins are contentious because of their sparse taxonomic distributions and poorly resolved phylogenies . With current data , their origin cannot be pinpointed with confidence . 161 Chapter 4 4 . 3 . 3 Reconstructing expansions in complexity of the CME - I network 4 . 3 . 3 . 1 Model for studying changes in complexity of the CME - I network Taken together , the data presented in sections 4 . 3 . 1 and 4 . 3 . 2 depict a complex picture regarding the origin and evolutionary diversification of CME . The phylogenomic data summarised in Figure 4 . 2 reveals that true orthology of the majority of proteins which make up the CME - interactome ( CME - I ) in H . sapiens can only be confirmed in Danio rerio . Even the genes encoding for the most conserved of CME - I proteins have undergone multiple duplications , losses , and recombination of functional domains , as can be observed for instance in the epsins , synaptojanins and auxilins . The evolution of multiple paralogues may reflect the evolution of diverse and specialised functions , a process which has been proposed to be a key aspect in the evolution of specificity in the eukaryotic endomembrane system ( Dacks et al . , 2009 ) . The results from the protein domain study presented in section 4 . 3 . 2 indicate that 15 of the 30 functional protein domain architectures present in the CME - I proteome were acquired in the LCEA , while 4 were acquired in the LCUA , 3 were acquired in the LCOA , 4 were acquired in the LCHA , and only 1 protein domain structure is specific to metazoans ( the remaining three could not be mapped to the eukaryotic tree with confidence ) ( Figure 4 . 24 ) . Also , out of the 11 protein domain structures acquired in the LCUA , the LCOA and the LCHA , 7 were a result of recombination of existing protein domains and only 4 were acquired de novo . This suggests that the molecular functions associated with all but 4 of the protein domains necessary for CME was already present in the LCEA . Therefore , the evolutionary history of CME is multifaceted , because it is both conserved and ancient while in contrast has many derived forms . This can be explained by an evolutionary model whereby CME was already complex in the LCEA , but then 162 Chapter 4 diversified and gained further complexity via gene duplications and rearrangements of protein domains architectures . To investigate this evolutionary process , I referred to the data on known interactions within the CME - I network reviewed in chapter 3 , and related it to the evolutionary ancestry data to create a model describing putative CME - I network at different stages of eukaryote evolution . The identification of novel interactions as shared derived characters was key to the construction of this model . The rationale explained in sections 3 . 1 and 3 . 2 . 3 was applied to identify putative origins for novel interaction ( Appendix 3 ) . This data was combined with the data on protein domain architecture evolution to construct a model of CME - I network evolution . A difficulty encountered in formulating these networks is that binding motifs necessary for certain types of protein - protein physical interactions are only a few amino acids in length and are rarely recognised by protein domain recognition . For instance , the AP2 complex can bind to clathrin heavy chain via a LLNLD motif on the linker region of the β subunit , whereas epsin 1 binds to clathrin via either a LMDLAD or a LVDLD motif in the central or C - terminal region of the protein , respectively ( Dell ' Angelica , 2001 ) . This was found for mammalian systems , but no data exists regarding clathrin binding sites in any other eukaryotic system . It is therefore difficult to investigate whether a certain motif existed at a given stages of eukaryotic evolution . The model therefore relies on the assumption that a hypothetical ancestral protein which features the same protein domain architecture as its extant homologue , will also feature the same clathrin and AP2 binding motifs as its extant homologue . 163 Chapter 4 4 . 3 . 3 . 2 The CME - I network in the LCEA The model predicts the LCEA featured clathrin and the AP2 complex which interacted with the following hypothetical proteins : an epsin ancestor featuring an ENTH domain and clathrin and AP2 large subunit appendage binding sites ; an AP180 ancestor featuring an ANTH domain , a clathrin and a AP2 large subunit appendage binding site ; an EPS15 ancestor with EH domains , a clathrin and a AP2 large subunit appendage binding sites . Interaction with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphoinositide was mediated by the AP2 large α subunit , the ENTH domain and the ANTH domain . Interaction with YXXØ and [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] internalisation signals was mediated by the AP2 μ subunit . The uncoating process was putatively mediated by three hypothetical proteins , each with one of the three phosphatase domains Syja , Exo _ endo _ phos and PTEN _ C2 , and by domains HSC70 and DNAJ . In addition , the model suggests the actin binding ADF domain and the Dynamin _ N - Dynamin _ M - GED domain structure was present in the LCEA , but the data do not suggest these domains were integrated in the CME - I network . The putative LCEA CME - I network is depicted in Figure 4 . 25 . 4 . 3 . 3 . 3 Expansion of network complexity in the LCUA CME - I The first step in complexity is traceable to the LCUA . The network analysis predicts the acquisition of the following novel protein families : a hypothetical HIP1 / HIP1R ancestor featuring the ANTH - ILWEQ protein domain combination which interacted with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 via the ANTH domain , interacted with filamentous actin via the ILWEQ domain , and featured clathrin and AP2 large subunit appendage binding sites ; a hypothetical amphiphysin and endophilin ancestor featuring the BAR - SH3 protein domain combination which bound the plasma membrane with the BAR domain and the 164 Chapter 4 PRD of N - WASP via the SH3 domain and featured clathrin and AP large subunit appendage binding sites ; a hypothetical TOCA - 1 / FBP17 / CIP4 ancestor featuring the FCH - SH3 protein domain combination , which bound plasma membrane with the BAR domain and the PRD region of N - WASP via the SH3 domain . Finally , the ADF acquired a C - terminal SH3 domain but no novel interactions were acquired as a result . The putative LCUA CME - I network is depicted in Figure 4 . 26 . 165 Figure 4 . 25 Connectivity diagram depicting the putative CME - I network topology in the last common eukaryotic ancestor . In this Figure and in Figures 4 . 26 - 28 , novel protein domains are shown in coloured bars while ancient protein domains are white bars with grey margins . The X and the Y bars represent respectively putative clathrin binding motifs and putative AP2 appendage binding motifs . Novel binding interactions are shown with black lines . Ancient interactions are depicted by grey lines . Green writing in grey box represent novel internalisation signals . PI2 represents phosphoinositide PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . Chapter 4 4 . 3 . 3 . 4 Expansion of network complexity in the LCOA CME - I The second step in complexity is in the LCOA where SH3 - PX - BAR , RhoGEF - BAR and ENTH - UIM protein domain combinations were acquired . However , these additions only translate into four novel putative interactions within the CME - I : a hypothetical SNX9 ancestor featuring the SH3 - PX - BAR interacted with N - WASP via the SH3 domain and featured clathrin and AP2 large subunit appendage binding sites ; the acquisition of the UIM domain at the C - terminal of the hypothetical epsin ancestor allowed for interactions with ubiquinated cargo ; the acquisition of the RhoGEF - BAR protein domain combination was not associated with novel interactions according to the data used for the model . The putative LCOA CME - I network is depicted in Figure 4 . 27 . 166 Figure 4 . 26 Connectivity diagram depicting the putative CME - I network in the last common unikont ancestor . This model predicts that membrane bending and actin regulation functions studied in mammalian CME were acquired in the LCUA . Chapter 4 4 . 3 . 3 . 5 Expansion of network complexity in the LCHA CME - I The third leap in complexity is in the LCHA . The model predicts the acquisition of a novel form of dynamin featuring the Dynamin _ N - Dynamin _ M - PH - GED - PRD domain structure , the acquisition of multiple SH3 domains at the N - and C - terminal of the RhoGEF - BAR domain proteins , and the acquisition of the PTB and the arrestin domain which are found in alternative CME monomeric adaptors . These novel protein forms introduced the following novel interactions : the hypothetical dynamin1 / 2 / 3 ancestor featuring the Dynamin _ N - Dynamin _ M - PH - GED - PRD protein domain combination interacted with the SH3 domains of the amphiphysin / endophilin ancestor , of the TOCA - 167 Figure 4 . 27 Connectivity diagram depicting the putative CME - I network in the last common opisthokont ancestor . The model predicts the SNX9 protein domain architecture was acquired , signifying futher advance in CME actin regulation function . The RhoGEF - BAR domain found in tuba was also acquired . Chapter 4 1 / FBP17 / CIP4 ancestor , of the ABP1 ancestor and of the tuba ancestor via its PRD domain ; the hypothetical ancestor of tuba featuring the SH3 - RhoGEF - BAR - SH3 domain structure interacted with N - WASP via one of its two C - terminal SH3 domains ; the hypothetical ancestor of ARH , disabled - 2 and numb featuring the PTB domain interacted with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and the FXNPXY internalisation signal via the PTB domain and bound to clathrin and AP2 large subunit via putative binding sites ; the hypothetical 168 Figure 4 . 28 Connectivity diagram depicting the putative CME - I network topology in the last common holozoan ancestor . Significant expansion in complexity of the CME - I network was mediated by acquisition of classical dynamin protein domain architecture , the tuba specific SH3 domains and monomeric CME adaptors β - arrestins and PTB proteins ( ARH , disabled - 2 and numb ) . Chapter 4 ancestor of β - arrestin1 / 2 featuring the arrestin _ N - arrestin _ C domain structure interacted with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and G - protein coupled receptors via the arrestin _ N domain , and bound to clathrin and AP2 large subunit via putative binding sites . The putative LCOA CME - I network is depicted in Figure 4 . 28 . 4 . 4 Discussion In this chapter I presented a study of the evolutionary history of CME . The study is based on three parts : a comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of the CME - I , the mapping of putative protein domain acquisition and rearrangements to the eukaryotic tree of life , and the construction of a model depicting CME ' s expansion of complexity in relation to eukaryotic evolution . Here , I first discuss the significance of the results in relation to previously published data . Starting with the taxonomic distribution of CME - I components , this study relates in particular to two previously published comparative genomic studies ( Field et al . , 2007 ; Schmid & McMahon , 2007 ) . Some of the results presented here are thus redundant . For instance the taxonomic distribution of Clathrin heavy chain and the AP2 complex among diverse eukaryotes had already been reported , including the fact that AP2 is missing in Trypanosoma and Cyanidioschyzon ( Field et al . , 2007 ) . The same study also looked at epsins , dynamins , EPS15 and dab - 2 , reporting similar results ( Field et al . , 2007 ) . However , the taxonomic distribution of β - arrestins , HIP1 , Amphiphysin , FCH proteins , SNX9 , intersectins , ABP1 , N - WASP , auxilin and synaptojanin , have not been reported before , at least not across eukaryotic diversity . Indeed , the comparative genomic data by Schmid & McMahon ( Nature , 2007 ) concerns most of those proteins , 169 Chapter 4 but its taxon sampling is limited to Metazoa and one apicomplexan protist ( Plasmodium falciparum ) , which is not sufficient for a robust eukaryotic study . The study reported in this thesis also uses advanced phylogenetic methods to determine orthology , which is , arguably , a more exhaustive and reliable method than sole analysis of protein domain structure or protein size alone . Thanks to this method , the trend of vertebrate - specific gene duplications was highlighted , which in turn entailed further distinction between closely related paralogues ( inparalogues ) to distantly related paralogues ( outparalogues ) . Comparing results on the same proteins between previous study and this one , this method proved useful in proteins such as dynamin , which was reported to have orthologues in Fungi , Amoebozoa and Arabidopsis thaliana ( Field et al . , 2007 ) , while our phylogeny robustly indicated that classical dynamins are specific to Holozoa ( Figure 4 . 11 ) . Two previous analyses suggested the dynamins were highly derived , although with a reduced taxon sampling which did not feature basal metazoans , basal fungi or any choanozoans ( Elde et al . , 2005 ; Miyagishima et al . , 2008 ) , thus not pinpointing origin at the base of the Holozoa . Therefore , while certainly not without problems - notably the difficulties in determining evolutionary relationships in poorly resolved phylogenies - this approach arguably provides an improved predictive potential for comparative genomic studies such as this one . Furthermore , by studying the phylogenetic distribution of protein domain architecture predictions , some important protein domain rearrangements were pinpointed on the eukaryotic tree of life , albeit with varying degrees of statistical confidence . These include dynamins , ABP1 , tuba , SNX9 , HIP1 and epsins . While this method has been used effectively in evolutionary studies of motor proteins such as myosins and kinesins 170 Chapter 4 ( Richards & Cavalier - Smith , 2005 ; Wickstead et al . , 2010 ) , it has not been systematically used on CME studies , with the exception of an epsin study where the ENTH - UIM structure of epsins was reported as being opisthokont - specific ( Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) . However , tracing the occurrence of protein domain rearrangements is important towards understanding the evolution of CME . This was illustrated in the reconstruction of CME - I network complexity expansion in unikonts and holozoans ( Figure 4 . 26 and 4 . 28 ) , where protein domain rearrangement are suggested to play an important role . Finally , by sampling a broad diversity of eukaryotes , and including in the analyses all the paralogues that were similar enough to align with confidence and not produce long branches , some of the phylogenies reported here represent a valuable evolutionary characterisation of the respective protein families . For several CME proteins , phylogenies have been previously reported , often within the format of protein family reviews . However , in those analyses , the taxonomic sampling used is narrow and the phylogenies are inferred with distance and parsimony methods , which are not as successful at resolving phylogenies as parametric , likelihood methods such as the ones used in this thesis . These include phylogenies for β - arrestin ( Alvarez , 2008b ) , BAR domain proteins ( amphiphysins , endophilin , tuba and SNX9 ) ( Habermann , 2004 ) , FCH proteins ( Ahmed et al . , 2010 ) , sorting nexins ( SNX9 ) ( Cullen , 2008 ; Seet & Hong , 2006 ) , ABP1 ( Lappalainen et al . , 1998 ) and auxilin ( Bai et al . , 2010 ) . Phylogenies of other CME proteins , namely AP180 / CALM , HIP1 / HIP1R , N - WASP and synaptojanins , are reported here for the first time . 171 Chapter 4 With regards to the primary aim set out in the chapter ' s introduction , it is proposed here that the holistic approach used in this study produces a robust model of the evolutionary history of CME . The starting point is the LCEA cell which , as indicated by previous studies ( Field et al . , 2007 ; Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) , formed clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles with adaptor components such as an early AP2 complex , and ancient relatives of epsins , EPS15 and AP180 . The detail that the two dephosphorylating protein domains of synaptojanins ( Syja _ N and exo _ endo _ phos ) were encoded in the LCEA and were potentially involved in vesicle uncoating in that early system , is added here . But how did CME further evolve into the complex mechanism that is studied in mammalian cell types ? Here I discuss the two stages where CME underwent substantial modifications ( Figure 4 . 26 - 28 ) . As mentioned in section 4 . 3 . 2 , two novel protein domains and two novel protein domain architectures were acquired in the LCUA ( Figure 4 . 3 ) . Interestingly , all four acquisitions are either directly or indirectly involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation . The ADF and ILWEQ domains bind filamentous actin directly ( Lappalainen et al . , 1998 ; McCann & Craig , 1997 ) , while the SH3 domains at the C - terminal of N - BAR and FCH proteins bind the PRD region in N - WASP which in turn activates actin polymerisation ( Hartig et al . , 2009 ; Yamada et al . , 2009 ) . The other acquired function is membrane deformation , as both the N - BAR and FCH domains proteins mediate membrane bending ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . When considering the putative CME - I in the LCEA ( Figure 4 . 25 ) , no explicit molecular link exists between the core CME components and the actin cytoskeleton , much as there is no explicit plasma membrane bending effector . In addition , no SH3 - PRD interactions can be traced to the LCEA . 172 Chapter 4 Taken together , these data suggest that fundamental modifications occurred in the LCUA , whereby the integration of actin cytoskeleton dynamics with core CME machinery was acquired and linked to a novel membrane deformation system . Crucially , the integration of the novel functions was mediated by the SH3 - PRD protein - protein interaction which were also acquired in the LCUA . The overall expansion in complexity of the CME - I network in the LCUA also provides strong evidence in favour of unikonts being monophyletic . The second major set of modifications in CME can be traced to the LCHA . The ' classical ' dynamin protein domain structure was acquired , as was the presence of multiple SH3 domains at the N - and C - terminal of a RhoGEF - BAR central region found in tuba ( Figure 4 . 3 ) . These two novel protein domain combinations introduced the system of vesicle scission , and its integration with actin polymerisation , as it is studied in mammalian CME . As with the changes which occurred in the LCUA , the SH3 - PRD protein - protein interactions play an important part in these modifications . The PRDs of the novel endocytic dynamins bind to at least five different SH3 domains , namely the ones at the C - terminal of N - BAR , FCH , and ABP1 proteins , and the ones at the N - terminal of tuba and SNX9 ( David et al . , 1996 ; Salazar et al . , 2003 ; Hartig et al . , 2009 ; Kessels et al . , 2001 ; Shin et al . , 2007 ) . All five SH3 - featuring proteins are also linked to actin polymerisation by binding the PRD of N - WASP ( Bu et al . , 2009 ; Cestra et al . , 2005 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ; Pinyol et al . , 2007 ; Shin et al . , 2007 ) . In the LCHA , the PTB domain found in the ARH / disabled 2 / numb family and the arrestin domain found in β - arrestin1 / 2 were also acquired ( Figure 4 . 24 ) . These two acquisitions are related as both families are known to be alternative monomeric CME adaptors ( Traub , 2003 ) . The 173 Chapter 4 acquisition of these two protein families may be linked to an increased requirement of cellular signalling specificity due to cellular diversification in basal holozoan organisms . The way these results relate to the modular nature of the CME - I network described in Chapter 3 is interesting . The core module , for instance , likely evolved in the LCEA , except for endocytic adaptors β arrestins and PTB proteins which evolved in the LCHA . The membrane bending module evolved in the LCUA , while the actin attachment module evolved mainly in the LCUA , but also in the LCOA and the LCHA . The vesicle scission module evolved in the LCHA with the rise of the ' classical dynamins ' . Part of the uncoating module is prokaryotic in origin ( HSC70 and the DNAJ protein domain ) , while the dephosphorylating protein domains Syja _ N and Endo _ exo _ phosphatase evolved in the LCEA . The auxilin paralogue however evolved with the vertebrates . This indicates a correlation between the modular nature of the CME - I network and its evolutionary history . With regards to the diversity of CME across eukaryotic diversity , this study was not able to provide a significant amount of information as most of the proteins analysed are poorly conserved and may only be present as a divergent paralogue . For instance , the data shows that all non - opisthokont taxa encode dynamin - related proteins , and also proteins that feature the EH domain , proteins with the dephosphorylating domain Syja _ N , and , as previously reported , proteins with the ENTH domain ( Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) . Yet how those proteins work in diverse protists or Plantae needs to be investigated at a cell biological level . Overall , a problem with understanding 174 Chapter 4 endocytic diversity in eukaryotes is the taxonomic bias with which the CME - I network was defined . The literature used refers mostly to studies performed on mammalian cell types , and in a smaller part to studies performed on yeast cells ( see Table 3 . 1 for list of cell types and model organism ) . As a result , the list of query proteins used as search sequences in the homology searches reflects the diversification and specificity of CME in mammals and yeast but not of other eukaryotic lineages . Considering the split between opisthokonts and amoebozoans for instance , I listed the CME - I components and protein functional domains that were likely acquired in the LCOA , but the analysis does not account for amoebozoan - specific CME - related innovations . The issue of asymmetry will be discussed further in Chapter 7 . A further issue concerns data security . The bioinformatics - based research carried out in this study was informed by a rich literature of cell biological data regarding CME . Therefore , it is important to evaluate how reliable and robust the data really is . As explained in the method section of this chapter , certain criteria were applied in identifying the protein components of the CME - I . These were in short that a protein had to be shown to physically interact with at least two established CME proteins ( e . g . clathrin , AP2 , epsin , EPS15 , AP180 , dynamin ) , and that the role played within CME had to be elucidated by functional studies . For instance , data indicates that amphiphysin binds the appendage of AP2α subunit and clathrin heavy chain via specific motifs , and also that during vesicle formation , amphiphysin recruits dynamin and interacts with N - WASP to modulate the actin cytoskeleton ( David et al . , 1996 ; McMahon et al . , 1997 ; McPherson et al . , 1996 ; Slepnev et al . , 2000 ; Yamada et al . , 2009 ) . However , the quantity of data available on a specific protein was not taken into account and it may 175 Chapter 4 provide better data security to only consider proteins that have been confirmed by a minimum number of independent studies . The other data security problem is establishing the specificity of selected proteins to CME function . This is especially important given that multiple distinct endocytic pathways have been documented ( see section 1 . 3 ) . The ideal scenario is selecting only proteins for which there is evidence of involvement in CME and evidence for its non - involvement in other endocytic pathway , or even a separate cellular processes . However that is seldom the case . Table 3 . 2 lists proteins that are involved in clathrin - independent endocytosis and other cellular functions . A trend that was noticed is that those proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton modulation tend to be involved in endocytic pathways other than CME . Evidence shows that this is the case for amphiphysin ( Yamada et al . , 2007 ) , FBP17 ( Tsuboi et al . , 2009 ) , SNX9 ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ) ABP1 ( Dieckmann et al . , 2010 ) and N - WASP ( Park & Cox , 2009 ) . Furthermore , dynamin is documented to mediate vesicle scission in caveolin - mediated endocytosis and also to be important in phagocytosis ( Gold et al . , 1999 ; Pelkmans & Helenius , 2002 ; Sauvonnet et al . , 2005 ) . Dynamin - related proteins also mediate non - endocytic functions , i . e . organelle division and cytokinesis ( Miyagishima et al . , 2003 ; Thompson et al . , 2002 ) . However , even proteins that are typically considered CME markers such as epsin and EPS15 , can play a role in caveolin - mediated endocytosis ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) , and the AP2 complex is involved in post - endocytic trafficking in ARF6 - regulated clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Lau & Chou , 2008 ) . Finally it must also be noted that clathrin itself can play a role in a non - endocytic function , i . e . mitosis ( Royle et al . , 2005 ) . In light of this evidence , some of the results presented in this chapter should be considered with caution , and the importance of testing predictions with cell biological studies is iterated . 176 Chapter 5 5 Comparative genomic and phylogenetic study of eisosome components Pil1 and Lsp1 5 . 1 Introduction Understanding endocytosis entails the consideration of several molecular mechanisms , such as the deformation of plasma membranes , the formation of vesicle coats , the identification of cargo internalisation signals , the inward transport of the vesicle and the recycling of vesicle coat components ( Conner & Schmid , 2003 ; Kumari et al . , 2010 ; Ungewickell & Hinrichsen , 2007 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ) . In Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of this thesis , results were presented regarding the organisation of the system of protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions that fulfil the molecular requirements of CME , and its likely evolution . Results presented thus far , therefore provide an insight into the complex nature of endocytosis , but do not address the spatial distribution of endocytosis on the plasma membrane . Little is known about how cells regulate the spatial organisation of endocytosis . In section 1 . 3 . 3 , endocytic membrane micro - domains and cell surface structures which have been observed in protists such as Trypanosoma and Tetrahymena were mentioned ( Gonda et al . , 2000 ; Porto - Carreiro et al . , 2000 ) . In these protists , sites of cargo entry and exit appear to be limited to these specialised regions . Similarly , in certain cell types such as fungal hyphae and mammalian epithelial cells , endocytosis and exocytosis occurs in specialised cell surface structures that support morphogenesis and polar growth ( Fuchs et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ) . However , in cells where specialised plasma membrane domains cannot be recognised , where endocytosis and exocytosis 177 Chapter 5 appears to be distributed evenly across the cell surface , the mechanism for determining sites of endocytosis is still poorly understood . Endocytic protein complexes known as eisosomes have been suggested to mark spatial sites of endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . Eisosomes are composed of large and stable assemblies of the cytoplasmic proteins Pil1 and Lsp1 , which form at the plasma membrane ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . Experimental data has shown that these protein complexes affect both endocytosis and plasma membrane integrity , because deletion of Pil1 , results in loss of endocytic efficiency and severe disruption of endocytic site distribution , coupled with the occurrence of aberrant plasma membrane invaginations ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . 178 Figure 5 . 1 Eisosomes assemble into punctate complexes at the plasma membrane of S . cerevisiae cells . Arrows point to the yellow patches which is where Pil1 - GFP co - localises with lipophilic marker FM4 - 64 ( red ) , at proposed early endocytic vesicles . Green patches represent the Pil1 - GFP signal ( Taken from Swaminathan , 2006 ) . Chapter 5 Eisosomes were also found to colocalise with plasma membrane micro - domains , known as the membrane compartment of Can1 ( MCC ) , which feature several proteins with transmembrane domains involved in transport and sphingolipid signalling ( Grossmann et al . , 2008 ) . Two MCC proteins , Nce102 and Slm1 , have been shown to play a role in eisosome organisation ( Frohlich et al . , 2009 ; Kamble et al . , 2011 ) . Conversely , the deletion of Pil1 causes all MCC markers to dissipate ( Grossmann et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , eisosomes appear to operate as part of the signalling pathway , consisting of 179 Figure 5 . 2 Schematic model of the eisosome / MCC system . Diagram summarises existing data on eisosome regulation and function . All graph components are schematic and not in scale . References for the data is included in diagram annotation . Chapter 5 long chain bases ( LCB ) and kinases Pkh1 / 2 , Pkc1 and Ypk1 / 2 , which is involved in cell wall integrity and cell wall remodelling during growth ( Luo et al . , 2008 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . The data demonstrate that Pil1 and Lsp1 negatively regulate Pkh and its activation of the Pkc and Ypk pathways ( Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , Pkh1 and Pkh2 have been shown to phosphorylate Pil1 and Lsp1 in vitro and in vivo , which activates eisosome assembly ( Luo et al . , 2008 ; Walther et al . , 2007 ) , whereas inactivation of Ypk kinases and the disruption of LCB synthesis causes disassembly of eisosomes ( Luo et al . , 2008 ) . A schematic diagram of the emerging eisosome / MCC model can be seen in Figure 5 . 2 . The composition of eisosomes is still an open question . It is debatable whether MCC proteins , such as Sur7 , Nce102 and Slm1 , should be considered integral parts of eisosomes , or rather that eisosomes and MCCs are distinct and only interact transiently in a regulatory capacity . Here , I define eisosomes conservatively as Pil1 and Lsp1 assemblies at the plasma membrane , and I define MCC proteins that regulate eisosomes as eisosome related proteins ( ERP ) . With regard to function , current published experimental data does not exhaustively conclude whether eisosomes play an active role in the molecular mechanisms involved in endocytosis , or simply help to define plasma membrane micro - domains with the required protein and lipid composition . However , the putative involvement of eisosomes in endocytosis ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) , their regulatory interactions with MCCs ( Grossmann et al . , 2008 ) and their role in the LCB / kinase sphingolipid signalling pathway ( Luo et al . , 2008 ) makes a strong case for eisosomes to be involved at least in the spatial organisation of endocytosis . Studies on eisosomes have so far been limited to budding yeast Saccharomyces 180 Chapter 5 cerevisiae ( Kamble et al . , 2011 ; Luo et al . , 2008 ; Walther et al . , 2006 ) , the yeast species Ashbya gossypii ( Seger et al . , 2011 ) , and to the filamentous ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans ( Vangelatos et al . , 2010 ) . In the study of Aspergillus nidulans , Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues were shown to be present in all ascomycetes , and a phylogeny suggested that multiple gene duplications occurred in the evolution of eisosomes in ascomycete fungi , but no further evolutionary data has yet been presented . In this chapter , I investigate the importance of eisosomes to eukaryotic endocytosis with bioinformatics tools . The experimental outline is to carry out a comparative genomic study of Pil1 and Lsp1 in a diverse range of eukaryotic organism to establish the taxonomic distribution of eisosomes . I then carried out a phylogenetic analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Pil1 and Lsp1 . Finally , a secondary structure prediction analysis of a sample of Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues is presented . The data from these analyses is used to predict the likely origin and evolution of eisosomes . 5 . 2 Materials and methods 5 . 2 . 1 Identifying Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues A total of 27 genome projects , representing a broad diversity of eukaryotes diversity were selected for database searches ( see Table 2 . 1 ) for details of genome projects and online sources ) . Pil1 and Lsp1 sequences were searched against predicted proteomes and translated nucleotide databases using BLASTp , PSI - BLAST and tBLASTn , as described in section 2 . 1 . 2 . Further database searches were then performed against predicted proteomes and translated nucleotide databases from an additional set of 17 fungal genome projects ( see Table 2 . 2 for details of genome project and online sources ) . 181 Chapter 5 The additional searches were performed with BLASTp , PSI - BLAST and tBLASTn , as described in section 2 . 1 . 2 . Pil1 and Lsp1 sequences were also searched against the Blastocladiella emersonii expressed sequence tags database ( EST ) ( Ribichich et al . , 2005 ) http : / / blasto . iq . usp . br / and TBestDB , a database comprising of EST libraries from 49 organisms ( O ' Brien et al . , 2007 ) ( http : / / tbestdb . bcm . umontreal . ca / searches / ) . Both searches were performed using tBLASTn ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) . Finally , The trace files archive available on NCBI ( Sayers et al . , 2010 ) was searched using BLASTn . In all cases , threshold levels for significance of sequence similarity was e < 1 x 10 - 5 . 5 . 2 . 2 Cloning and sequencing putative Pil1 homologue from a Blastocladiella emersonii cDNA library The EST BeE60C21E01 from cDNA library of the chytridiomycete Blastocladiella emersonii ( Ribichich et al . , 2005 ) http : / / blasto . iq . usp . br / , was found to share significant sequence similarity with both Pil1 and Lsp1 ( E - value = 7e - 15 for Lsp1 , 7e - 19 for Pil1 ) . The corresponding cDNA clone ( in pSPORT1 ) was obtained from Prof . Suely L . Gomes ( Departamento de Bioquimica , Universidade de São Paulo , Brazil ) . The cDNA clone was sequenced with vector - specific primers T7 and SP6 and with the following clone - specific primers . Sense : BlemF1 5 ' - AGCAGTTTGCGGGGCACCA - 3 ' and BlemF2 5 ' - CTGGCGTAATAGCGAAGA - 3 ' . Anti - sense : BlemR1 5 ' - ACCTTGTGCTCGGCG - TCG - 3 ' and BlemR2 5 ' - TCTTCGCTATTACGCCAG - 3 ' . The resulting sequencing reads covered both strands of the full length cDNA and were edited and assembled into a single contig with Sequencher ( see section 2 . 2 . 10 for details ) . 5 . 2 . 3 Cloning and sequencing putative Pil1 homologue from a Capsaspora 182 Chapter 5 owczarzaki cDNA library An EST from the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki ( NUL00001676 ) , was identified from the TBestDB EST database ( O ' Brien et al . , 2007 ) ( http : / / tbestdb . bcm . umontreal . ca / searches / ) and found to share significant sequence similarity with Pil1 ( E - value = 2e - 07 ) . The corresponding cDNA clone was obtained from Prof . Andrew Roger ' s laboratory ( Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , University of Dalhousie ) . The cDNA clone was sequenced with vector specific primers ( M13 forward and M13 reverse ) and with the following clone specific primers . Sense : lc2Rev 5 ' - ATCTTGAGCGATACAACCGAAA - 3 ' and lc3Rev 5 ' - ATTCAAACGCCTATGCCAAC - 3 ' ; anti - sense : lc2Fwd 5 ' - TGAAGGACAGCAAG - ACCATT - 3 ' and lc3Fwd 5 ' - TGAAGGACAGCAAGACCATT - 3 ' . The resulting sequencing reads covered both strands of the full length cDNA and were edited and assembled into a single contig with Sequencher ( see section 2 . 2 . 10 for details ) . 5 . 2 . 4 Phylogenetic analyses of Pil1 and Lsp1 Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues were recovered from a selection of predicted proteomes , representing the diversity of Fungi ( see Tables 2 . 1 - 2 . 2 for details on taxa and online access of genome projects ) . The sequences were aligned with MUSCLE ( Edgar , 2004a ) . Hyper - variable regions and gaps were removed with SEAVIEW ( Gouy et al . , 2010 ) . The masked data set was analysed to infer optimal model parameters with MODELGENERATOR ( Keane et al . , 2006 ) . The LG model with proportion of invariable site ( 0 . 04 ) and Γ distribution ( α = 3 . 5 ) was selected . A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was carried out with MRBAYES 3 . 1 . 2 ( Ronquist & Huelsenbeck , 2003 ) , performing 1 , 000 , 000 MCMC generations , sampling trees every 100 generations . The 183 Chapter 5 RtREV amino acid substitution score matrix was used as the LG model is not implemented by the current version . Trees with low likelihood values were discarded and a consensus tree with posterior probability node support was derived from the remaining sampled trees . Fast maximum likelihood ( ML ) analyses were run with RAXML and PHYML , performing 1 , 000 bootstrap replicates each . The LG model was implemented in both analyses . For the PHYML analysis among - site rate variation was corrected by α value ( 3 . 5 ) and 8 discreet categories , describing the Γ distribution . For the RAXML analysis , the hard coded setting of 4 categories was routinely used . 5 . 2 . 5 Secondary structure prediction of Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues A total of 11 sequences representing the diversity of Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues were selected for secondary structure prediction . The sequences were analysed using the JPRED 3 secondary structure prediction server , which implements the JNET algorithm ( Cole et al . , 2008 ) ( http : / / www . compbio . dundee . ac . uk / www - jpred / ) . JNET predicts secondary structures of a given amino acid sequence ( the three possible states are α - helix , β - sheet and coiled - coil ) by training a neural network secondary structure prediction algorithm with multiple sequence alignment profiles in the form of position specific scoring matrices ( PSSM ) and Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) profiles ( Cuff & Barton , 2000 ) . The use of PSSMs and HMMs in secondary structure prediction algorithm has been shown to improve significantly the accuracy of predictions ( Cole et al . , 2008 ; Cuff & Barton , 2000 ; Jones , 1999 ) . JNET calculates confidence values for secondary structure prediction at each amino acid residue by subtracting the score for the second highest scoring state from the score for highest scoring state ( Cuff & Barton , 2000 ) . 184 Chapter 5 5 . 3 Results 5 . 3 . 1 Taxonomic distribution of Pil1 and Lsp1 The amino acid sequences for S . cerevisiae Pil1 and Lsp1 were used as query sequences for homology searches against 28 eukaryotic predicted proteome and translated nucleotide genomic databases . Sequences with significant similarity to Pil1 and Lsp1 were found in Magnaporthe oryzae , Ustilago maydis and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis . No sequence similarity to Pil1 or Lsp1 homologues was found with either BLASTp , PSI - BLAST or tBLASTn searches , in non - fungal organisms . This preliminary result suggests the Pil1 and Lsp1 paralogues might be specific to Fungi . To investigate this possibility further , I performed Pil1 and Lsp1 homology searches against predicted proteomes and translated nucleotide databases of a diverse group of fungi and opisthokont protists . These include 6 members of the Saccharomycotina ( Ashbya gossypii , Candida glabrata , Candida albicans , Debaryomyces hansenii , Lodderomyces elongisporus and Yarrowia lipolytica ) 3 representative Pezizomycotina species ( Aspergillus fumigatus , Botrytis cinerea and Neurospora crassa ) , 1 member of the Taphrinomycotina ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) , 5 members of the Basidiomycota ( Cryptococcus neoformans , Laccaria bicolor , Phanerochaete chrysosporium , Postia bicolor , Puccinia graminis ) 2 representative Zygomycota species ( Phycomyces blakesleeanus and Rhizopus oryzae ) , 1 Chytridiomycota species ( Allomyces macrogynus ) , 1 Microsporidia species ( Encephalitozoon cuniculi ) , 1 member of the Choanoflagellata ( Salpingoeca rosetta ) , 1 member of the Ichthyosporea ( Sphaeroformans arctica ) and 1 Filasterea species ( Ministeria brivans ) . In addition , I searched the Pil1 and Lsp1 sequences against expressed sequence tags ( EST ) databases of a selection of additional fungal and opisthokont protist taxa . These include 2 185 Chapter 5 Taphrinomycotina species ( Saitoella complicata and Taphrina deformans ) , 1 Zygomycota species ( Morteriella verticillata ) , 2 members of the Chytridiomycota ( Allomyces macrogynus and Blastocladiella emersonii ) , 1 Microsporidia species ( Antonospora locustae ) , 2 Choanoflagellata species ( Proterospongia sp . and Monosiga ovata ) , 1 Filasterea species ( Capsaspora owczarzaki ) and 1 Nucleariidae species ( Nuclearia simplex ) . Predicted proteins and / or translated nucleotide sequences with significant similarity to Pil1 and Lsp1 were found in all the saccharomycete , pezizomycete , taphrinomycete , basidiomycete and zygomycete taxa sampled . For the chytridiomycete species Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , a putative homologue was found ( sequence hit : BDEG _ 06158 ; E - value : 1 . 2e - 06 with Pil1 as query , and 2 . 0e - 06 with Lsp1 as query ) but the other chytridiomycete taxon sampled , Allomyces macrogynus , lacked any sequences that are significantly similar to either Pil1 or Lsp1 . No sequences with significant similarity to Pil1 or Lsp1 were found in the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi , the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta , the ichthyosporean Sphaeroformans arctica , or the filasterean Ministeria brivans ( Figure 5 . 3a ) . Translated EST sequences with significant similarity to Pil1 and Lsp1 were found in taphrinomycete Saitoella complicata , the zygomycete Morteriella verticillata and the chytridiomycete Blastocladiella emersonii . In the filasterean species Capsaspora owczarzaki , a tBLASTn search with Pil1 as query returned EST NUL00001676 with an E - value of 2e - 07 , 29 % amino acid identity and 48 % similarity . However , a tBLASTn search with Lsp1 as query did not return a significantly similar sequence . No sequences 186 Chapter 5 with significant similarity to Pil1 or Lsp1 were found in the EST databases of the taphrinomycete species Taphrina deformans , the chytridiomycete species Allomyces macrogynus , the microsporidian species Antonospora locustae , the nucleariid species Nuclearia simplex and choanoflagellate species Proterospongia sp . and Monosiga ovata ( Figure 5 . 3b ) . 5 . 3 . 2 Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of Pil1 and Lsp1 To investigate the evolutionary history of Pil1 and Lsp1 , I retrieved all of the putative Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues found in the comparative genomic study . In addition , I sequenced the full length cDNA fragment of BeE60C21E01 from a Blastocladiella emersonii EST library and NUL00001676 from a Capsaspora owczarzaki EST library ( see sections 5 . 2 . 2 and 5 . 2 . 3 ) . I also assembled a contig from Spizellomyces punctatus whole - genome shotgun data held in the NCBI trace archives ( see section 5 . 2 . 1 ) . All sequences retrieved were then aligned to create a multiple sequence alignment ( MSA ) in amino - acid format . The MSA was edited to exclude gaps and hypervariable regions and analysed to infer the optimal parameters for its evolutionary model . I then carried out a phylogenetic analysis of the masked data - set , using two fast - maximum likelihood ( ML ) methods ( PHYML and RAXML ) and one Bayesian method ( MRBAYES ) , and using bootstrap replicates and Bayesian posterior probability values ( PP ) , as statistical support for tree topologies ( see section 5 . 2 . 4 for details on methods ) . The trees obtained with the fast - ML and Bayesian analyses were rooted with C . owczarzaki NUL00001676 . However , this rooting depicts C . owczarzaki NUL00001676 as a long branch , and produced an unlikely clade comprising chytridiomycete and 187 Chapter 5 188 Figure 5 . 3 Taxonomic distribution of Pil1 and Lsp1 in Fungi and opisthokont protists . a Results from BLASTp , PSI - BLAST and tBLASTn searches against predicted proteomes and translated nucleotide databases .

The branch position of C . owczarzaki NUL00001676 may therefore be an artifact due to long branch attraction . A second set of fast - ML and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses was performed with the exclusion of C . owczarzaki NUL00001676 . The trees were rooted with a clade comprising the three chytridiomycete species ( Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , Spizellomyces punctatus , and Blastocladiella emersonii ) . To summarise the statistical node support from different phylogenetic analyses , the tree topology derived from the Bayesian analysis was selected as template and the bootstrap support values from PHYML and RAXML analyses were assigned , together with the Bayesian PP values , to the relevant nodes ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . Overall , the phylogenetic analyses indicate that Pil1 and Lsp1 have a complex evolutionary history , characterised by at least five gene duplications and one gene loss events ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . The gene duplication that produced the Pil1 and Lsp1 paralogues occurred in the last common ancestor of all the Saccharomycotina species sampled , minus Yarrowia lipolytica which branched off prior to the proposed duplication event . This result is supported by robust statistical support for both the Pil1 clade and the Lsp1 clade ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . The results are also consistent with a gene duplication event in the last common ancestor of the Ascomycota . This event , putatively produced a lineage ancestral to Pil1 and Lsp1 that was retained in all the ascomycete taxonomic groups , and a paralogous lineage that was retained in the Pezizomycotina and the Taphrinomycotina but not in the Saccharomycotina ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . The statistical support for the Pil1 / Lsp1 paralogue clade is 0 . 85 PP , 50 % RAXML bootstraps and 65 % PHYML bootstraps ( 0 . 85 / 50 / 65 ) . The statistical support for its paralogous clade 189 Chapter 5 190 Figure 5 . 4 Phylogenetic tree of Pil1 and Lsp1 . The topology was derived as the consensus tree from Bayesian phylogenetic analysis . Thick branches represent statistical support values of at least 0 . 80 Bayesian posterior probability ( PP ) , and 60 % from both RAXML and PHYML using 1000 bootstrap replicates . In key nodes support values are indicated in order as Bayesian PP , RAXML bootstrap support and PHYML bootstrap support . Species names , database accession numbers and taxonomic groups are indicated . Chapter 5 meanwhile is 0 . 99 / 60 / 69 . The phylogenetic tree also revealed two monophyletic basidiomycete clades . One clade has a support value of 0 . 96 / 56 / 62 for monophyly with the sister ascomycete clade , while the position of the other clade is poorly resolved ( see Figure 5 . 4 ) . The gene duplication event which produced the two clades therefore can not be pinpointed with certainty . Finally , the tree revealed a Candida glabrata - specific gene duplication , a Schizosaccharomyces pombe - specific gene duplication , a Phycomyces blakesleeanus - specific gene duplication and a gene duplication in the last 191 Figure 5 . 5 Schematic tree of Pil1 and Lsp1 evolutionary history .

A schematic tree summarising key gene duplication and loss events suggested by the phylogenetic analyses is shown in Figure 5 . 5 . 5 . 3 . 3 Secondary structure prediction of Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues A total of 11 amino acid sequences were selected for secondary structure prediction analysis of Pil1 homologues . These are Saccharomcyes cerevisiae Pil1 and Lsp1 , Magnaporthe oryzae MGG _ 00153 and MGG _ 11731 , Ustilago maydis EAK81372 , Cryptococcus neoformans AW44499 , Phycomyces blakesleeanus 79864 , Rhizopus oryzae RO3G _ 12496 , Blastocladiella emersonii BeE60C21E01 , Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis BDEG _ 06185 and Capsaspora owczarzaki NUL00001676 . The α - helix , β - sheet and coil secondary structure states were predicted for the 11 amino acid sequences , using the JNET algorithm ( see section 5 . 2 . 5 for details on JNET ) . The secondary structures were compared by aligning the 11 sequences with MUSCLE and annotating each sequence with secondary structures supported by confidence value of 7 or higher ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . The secondary structure of Pil1 and Lsp1 is characterised by α - helices and is strongly conserved in the putative homologues selected . In particular , a structure of five successive α - helices is shared in all of the sequences with only two deviations . Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis BDEG _ 06185 lacks the first of the five α - helices , while in Capsaspora owczarzaki NUL00001676 the third and fourth α - helices are predicted to be a single large α - helix . The NUL00001676 structure also features a 7 amino acid insert in the 3 rd / 4 th α - helix and a single amino acid insert in the 5 th α - helix 192 Chapter 5 ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . 5 . 4 Discussion The comparative genomic data I have reported in this chapter suggests that eisosomes are specific to the kingdom Fungi . To pinpoint the origin of the two known cytoplasmic components of eisosomes , Pil1 and Lsp1 , homology searches in basal fungal and opisthokont protist taxa were carried out . A homologue of Pil1 and Lsp1 was found in two of out three chytridiomycete taxa , but was absent in both microsporidian species examined . Pil1 and Lsp1 were absent in all opisthokont protists except for a putative homologue in Capsaspora owczarzaki ( NUL00001676 ) . This finding was not expected because the the opisthokont protist taxon is sister to metazoans whereas Pil1 and Lsp1 are absent in the Nucleariidae taxon that was sampled . However , the phylogenetic tree of Pil1 and Lsp1 suggests that the Capsaspora candidate homologue is a long branch ( Appendix 4 ) . In addition , by rooting the tree with the candidate Capsaspora homologue , an unlikely branch including basidiomycetes and chytridiomycete is produced . The secondary structure prediction study also shows that the Capsaspora candidate homologue is partly divergent from the other sequences . Taken together , these data make homology of the NUL00001676 sequence questionable . To further investigate the origin of eisosomes , more genomic data should be added to the current selection of basal fungal and opisthokont protist genome projects ( O ' Brien et al . , 2007 ; Ruiz - Trillo et al . , 2007 ) . Phylogenetic analyses showed that multiple gene duplication and at least one gene loss event have occurred in the evolutionary history of Pil1 and Lsp1 . Two gene duplications and one gene loss in was identified in ascomycetes as well as lineage specific duplications in Candida glabrata , Schizosaccharomyces pombe and 193 Chapter 5 194 Chapter 5 the two zygomycete taxa that were sampled . There are two basidiomycete paralogues too , but the tree does not explain when they duplicated . Taken together , the data suggest that the function of Pil1 and Lsp1 diversified significantly during the evolution of fungi . Here , I propose that eisosomes evolved as an adaptation to the evolution of the fungal cell wall , and that they characterised a fungal specific diversification of endocytosis . This hypothesis entails that eisosomes , and the functions they mediate , are conserved across diverse fungi . In the next Chapter , this notion is investigated by presenting data on the function of the eisosome in the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae . 195 Figure 5 . 6 Secondary structure prediction of Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues . Multiple sequence alignment was performed with MUSCLE and visualised with BOXSHADE . Black boxes indicate conserved invariant amino acids wheras grey boxes indicate conserved substitutions .

Only secondary structures with JNET confidence levels equal to or higher than 7 are represented . Chapter 5 196 Chapter 6 6 Functional characterisation of Magnaporthe oryzae MoPil1 and MoPil2 6 . 1 Introduction Eisosomes are large and stable protein complexes which localise at the cell surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Their putative involvement in , endocytosis ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) , the sphingolipid signalling pathway ( Luo et al . , 2008 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) , and the regulation of the membrane compartment of Can 1 ( MCC ) ( Grossmann et al . , 2008 ) ( Frohlich et al . , 2009 ; Kamble et al . , 2011 ) suggests a role in membrane dynamics and spatial regulation of endocytosis . The results from the phylogenomic analysis presented in chapter 5 , demonstrated that Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues are present in all the ascomycete , basidiomycete , and zygomycete fungi sampled , as well as in two out of the three chytridiomycete fungi included in the study , but that they are absent from all non - fungal organisms . This suggests that eisosomes were likely acquired at the base of the fungal tree and could thus represent a case of fungal specific diversification of endocytosis . This is important because , in chapter 4 , the results suggested that CME significantly diversified in the Holozoa , but no data exists on endocytic diversification that is specific to the holozoan sister groups ( i . e . the Fungi and nucleariids ) . However , thus far , the evidence of the involvement of eisosomes in endocytosis comes from cell biological studies of only budding yeast ( Grossmann et al . , 2008 ; Luo et al . , 2008 ; Walther et al . , 2007 ; Walther et al . , 2006 ) . The Fungi in fact comprise groups with very diverse morphology and ecology , for instance fungi with flagellated cells ( e . g . Chytridiomycota ) and multicellular fungi with filamentous growth and aerial spore 197 Chapter 6 dispersal ( e . g . pezizomycotina ; James et al . , 2006 ) . Homologues of Pil1 and Lsp1 were found in all major fungal divisions , but the phylogenetic analyses presented in chapter 5 , suggested that multiple , division specific , gene duplications and gene losses have occurred ( see Figure 5 . 3 ) . This may reflect a significant level of functional diversification of the eisosome across fungal diversity , and may mean the role of eisosomes in endocytosis is a derived function , specific to budding yeasts . To test whether eisosomes are important to the diversification of endocytosis in fungi , Pil1 and Lsp1 need to be characterised in fungal model organisms other than budding yeast . For instance , the phylogenetic analysis presented in section 5 . 3 . 2 , suggested that a gene duplication in the last common ancestor of ascomycete fungi resulted in a paralogue which is ancestral to both Pil1 and Lsp1 , and a paralogue which was retained in Pezizomycotina and Taphrinomycotina but was subsequently lost in the Saccharomycotina ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . There may thus be significant diversity of eisosome function within ascomycetes . The aim of this chapter , is to investigate this hypothesis by characterising Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues in the pezizomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae . M . oryzae is an ideal candidate for a comparative study of eisosome function in Ascomycota for the following reasons : ( i ) It is an economically important and devastating rice crop pathogen , which has been studied extensively in molecular biology laboratories , to engineer effective treatment against its spread ( Talbot , 2003 ) . ( ii ) M . oryzae can be transformed using a range of different markers , such as hygromycin B and sulfonylurea , and targeted gene replacement can be carried out to study gene 198 Chapter 6 function ( Talbot & Foster , 2001 ) . ( iii ) The life cycle of M . oryzae includes different developmental stages , such as the formation of aerial conidiophores , development of of appresoria , and vegetative hyphal growth , all with distinct cell organisation and morphology ( Wilson & Talbot , 2009 ) ( Figure 6 . 1 ) . ( iv ) M . oryzae is a pezizomycete , the sister group of saccharomycetes ( James et al . , 2006 ) , and thus represents the most closely related group of filamentous fungi to S . cerevisiae . 199 Figure 6 . 1 The infective life cycle of Magnaporthe oryzae . Life cycle begins with an asexual spore ( conidium ) which germinates on a host leaf cunicle . A germ tube expands from the condium and matures into an infection - ready appressorium . The turgour pressure of the dome - shaped cell eventually allows entry into the plant host via the extension of a penetration peg . Invasive hyphae ramify in the host tissue . Sporulation occurs at sites of host lesion . Figure taken from ( Wilson & Talbot , 2009 ) . Chapter 6 To distinguish between ascomycete specific paralogues , I name the two paralogues which resulted from a putative gene duplication event in the last common ancestor , Pil1 and Pil2 ( Figure 6 . 2 ) . According to the phylogenetic analysis presented in chapter 5 , the MGG _ 00153 M . oryzae homologue is in the Pil1 clade which has 0 . 93 posterior probability ( PP ) , 60 % PHYML bootstraps support and 50 % RAXML bootstraps support . By contrast , the MGG _ 11731 M . oryzae homologue is in the Pil2 clade which has 0 . 99 PP , 68 % PHYML bootstraps support and 68 % RAXML bootstraps support ( Figure 6 . 2 ) . MGG _ 00153 is thus referred to as MoPIL1 , and MGG _ 11731 is thus referred to as M . oryzae MoPIL2 . The first aim for this chapter , is to study the sub - cellular localisation of MoPil1 and MoPil2 at different developmental stages of M . oryzae . Although M . oryzae is heterothallic and can reproduce sexually ( Valent et al . , 1991 ) , its infective life cycle is asexual ( Wilson & Talbot , 2009 ) ( Figure 6 . 1 ) . The infective process starts with the attachment of a three - celled conidium ( asexual , non - motile spore ) to the host ' s leaf cuticle , via an adhesive released by an apical spore compartment during hydration ( Hamer et al . , 1988 ; Wilson & Talbot , 2009 ) . A narrow , polarised germ tube emerges from the spore before differentiating into a single celled , dome shaped , infective structure called the appressorium . Via development of turgor in the appressorium , massive pressure is exerted onto the leaf ' s cuticle , which is eventually pierced by the extension of a penetration peg from the base , allowing invasion of the host ( Howard & Valent , 1996 ) . From the penetration peg , bulbous , invasive hyphae develop , invading epidermal cells and ramifying through the host ' s tissue ( Wilson & Talbot , 2009 ) ( Figure 6 . 1 ) . Sporulation occurs from disease lesions , with formation of aerial conidiophores 200 Chapter 6 carried to new host plants via wind or dew splash ( Talbot , 2003 ) . In laboratory conditions , M . oryzae ' s infective developmental stages can be analysed by inducing the maturation of the infective structures on hydrophobic plastic surfaces ( Dean , 1997 ) . Vegetative hyphae can be grown on media and sporulation is induced by increased humidity . 201 Figure 6 . 2 Defining Pil1 and Pil2 paralogues in fungi . The ascomycete sub - tree is taken from the Pil1 and Lsp1 phylogeny presented in chapter 5 . The Pil1 and Pil2 paralogues are annotated . MGG _ 00153 is in the Pil1 clade , wheras MGG _ 11731 is in the Pil2 clade . The numeric values represent , in order , Bayesian posterior probability , the percentage RAXML bootstrap support and the percentage PHYML bootstrap support . Chapter 6 The second aim of this part of the project , is to compare the function of MoPil1 and MoPil2 , with S . cerevisiae eisosome components . A useful method to compare gene function is to test for functional complementation . This consists in transforming a null mutation strain for a native gene , with a homologous gene from a different organism , and testing whether the inserted gene functionally complements the host ' s deleted gene . Data shows that , although the function of Pil1 and Lsp1 is non - redundant , a Pil1 null mutation will cause severe disruption to plasma membrane integrity and distribution of endocytic sites , whereas deletion of Lsp1 will not ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . Because of this greater deleterious impact on the wild type phenotype , functional complementation of MoPil1 and MoPil2 is tested against Pil1 . The experimental outline for this chapter thus consists in : Creating M . oryzae strains expressing MoPil1 and MoPil2 fused with different reporter genes , and study sub - cellular localisation pattern of the two proteins , at different stages of M . oryzae ' s life cycle . Creating a S . cerevisiae pil1 Δ strains expressing MoPil1 , and create a S . cerevisiae pil1 Δ strain expressing MoPil2 . Then , compare the phenotype of the transformed strains with phenotype of the wild type strain to test test for functional complementation . 6 . 2 Materials and methods 6 . 2 . 1 Generating M . oryzae strains expressing MoPil1 - GFP and MoPil2 - GFP . A 3385 bp DNA fragment comprising the predicted MGG _ 00153 promoter region and 202 Chapter 6 coding sequence was amplified using primers 5Pil1 : 5 ' - ATGGATCCCACATTGTTC - TTCCTAACCGGC - 3 ' , and 3Pil1 : 5 ' - ATGAATTCGGCAAGAACGGCTTCCTGGG - 3 ' which feature a 5 ' end flanking Bam HI and Eco RI recognition sequence , respectively . The PCR reaction was prepared by mixing 100 ng of Magnaporthe oryzae genomic DNA ( 100 ng / μl ) , 1 μl 5Pil1 ( 20 pmol / μl ) , 1 μl 3Pil1 ( 20 pmol / μl ) , 5 μl Green GoTaq ® Flexi Buffer ( 5X ) , 2 . 5 μl MgCl 2 solution ( 25 pmol / μl ) , 0 . 5 GoTaq ® DNA polymerase ( 5u / μl ) and 14 μl nuclease free H 2 O . Polymerase Chain Reactions ( PCRs ) were incubated in a thermal cycler with the following program : step 1 . 95 ºC for 5 minutes ; step 2 . a cycle of 95 ºC for 30 seconds , 60 ºC for 30 seconds and 72 ºC for 3 minutes and 30 seconds , repeated 30 times ; step 3 . 72 ºC for 10 minutes . The amplicons were analysed by DNA gel electrophoresis to identify the predicted amplified DNA fragment . The amplicon was excised from the gel , purified and cloned into Bam HI and Eco RI sites of the linearised pCB1532 vector ( Sweigard , 1997 ) . The modified vector was then used to transform competent E . coli cells ( XL - 1 Blue strain , see section 2 . 26 for genotype ) . Successful transformants were screened by resistance to ampicillin . Plasmid preparations of a sample of transformed bacterial colonies were carried out . A 1015 bp DNA fragment consisting of the sGFP gene and NOS terminator were amplified from the pCAMBgfp vector ( Sesma & Osbourn , 2004 ) with primers 5GFP : 5 ' - ATGAATTCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG - 3 ' and 3NosT : 5’ - ATATCG - ATACTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATCATCGG - 3’ which feature 5 ' end flanking EcoRI and ClaI recognition sequences , respectively . The PCR , was prepared by mixing 1 μl pCAMBgfp plasmid DNA ( 50 ng / μl ) , 1 μl 5GFP1 ( 20 pmol / μl ) , 1 μl 3NosT ( 20 pmol / μl ) , 5 μl Green GoTaq ® Flexi Buffer ( 5X ) , 2 . 5 μl MgCl 2 solution ( 25 pmol / μl ) , 0 . 5 GoTaq ® DNA polymerase ( 5u / μl ) and 14 μl nuclease free H 2 O . Each reaction was 203 Chapter 6 incubated in a thermal cycler with the following program : step 1 . 95 ºC for 5 minutes ; step 2 . a cycle of 95 ºC for 30 seconds , 60 ºC for 30 seconds and 72 ºC for 1 minute and 30 seconds , repeated 30 times ; step 3 . 72 ºC for 5 minutes . The PCR products were analysed by DNA gel electrophoresis to identify the amplified DNA fragment . The amplicon was excised from the gel , purified and cloned into Eco RI and Cla I sites of the linearised pCB1532 + MGG _ 00153 vector via DNA ligation . The modified vector was then used to transform a batch of competent E . coli cells . Successful transformants were screened by resistance to ampicillin and plasmid preparations of a sample of transformed bacterial colonies were carried out . To confirm MoPil1 ( promoter and ORF ) and GFP were in - frame , the construct was sequenced using sense primer constrF 5 ' - GAAGCGAGCAAGGCTATCATTC - 3 ' and anti - sense primer , constrR 5 ' - CGTCGTCCTTGAAGAAGATGGT - 3 ' . The resulting sequencing reads were edited and assembled into a contig using Sequencher ( GenoCodes Corporation ) . The M . oryzae Guy - 11 strain ( Leung et al . , 1988 ) was then transformed with the pcb1532 + MGG _ 00153 + GFP vector .

Amplicons were excised , purified , and cloned into pSC - A ( Agilent Technologies ) which was sequenced with vector specific primers M13f and M13r . ( For details on these procedures , please see Section 2 . 2 . 4 ) . 6 . 2 . 5 Cloning MGG _ 11731 coding sequence from M . oryzae cDNA To clone the coding sequence of MGG _ 11731 , primers were designed from the MGG _ 11731 5 ' and 3 ' end sequences , which were obtained using RACE , as described in section 6 . 2 . 4 .

The S . cerevisiae pil1 Δ mutant strain was transformed with pYES2 + MGG _ 001153 , pYES2 + MGG _ 11731 and pYES2 ( empty vector for control ) using the acetate / single - stranded carrier DNA / polyethylene glycol transformation method ( Gietz & Woods , 2002 ) , as described in section 2 . 2 . 11 . 2 . Successful transformants were selected on uracil - deficient synthetic complete ( SC - U ) media agar plates ( see Section 2 . 2 . 11 . 2 for full media composition ) . Yeast colony PCR was performed with the zymolyase method ( H . R . Chen et al . , 1995 ) ( see section 2 . 2 . 9 . 2 for details ) . Expression of MGG _ 00153 and MGG _ 11731 , was induced by growing transformed strains in activation media ( SC - U with galactose , see section of 2 . 2 . 9 . 3 for full media composition ) . To test expression of MGG _ 00153 and MGG _ 11731 , reverse - transcription PCR was performed on RNA extracted from pil1 Δ : MGG _ 00153 and pil1 Δ : MGG _ 11731 strains grown overnight on activation media ( See sections 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 and 2 . 2 . 6 . 2 for details ) .

For the Calcofluor White , Congo Red and SDS sensitivity assays , agar plates consisting of YPD and three different concentrations of the desired chemical ( 20 and 40 μg / ml for Calcofluor White assays , 200 and 400 μg / ml for Congo Red assays and 10 and 40 μg / ml for SDS assays ) were prepared . S . cerevisiae cell cultures were grown to OD 600 = ~ 0 . 7 in liquid activation media . The cultures were first diluted to approx . 1 x 106 cells / ml , and serial dilutions were carried out . A 5 μl aliquot of each serial dilution was used to inoculate in all assays . For the cell viability assays , S . cerevisiae cell cultures were grown overnight in activation media ( uracil was added for non pYES2 transformed strains ) at 30 ºC with shaking . The cultures were diluted to OD 600 = 0 . 3 and grown for a further 3 h into log - phase ( OD 600 = 0 . 5 - 1 ) . The cultures were then serially diluted to a final concentration of 1 . 2 x 10 4 cells / ml . For each strain , one culture was incubated at 30 ºC and another heat shocked at 47 ºC for 80 min . An aliquot of 30 μl of the heat shocked cell suspensions , and an aliquot of 30 μl of the non - heat shocked cell suspension , were plated in triplicate on YPD agar plates which were then incubated at 30 ºC for 48 hours . S . cerevisiae colonies were counted and cell viability expressed as the number of viable yeast cells after heat shock over number of viable yeast cells kept at 30 ºC . The experiments were repeated three times . 6 . 3 Results 6 . 3 . 1 Generating a M . oryzae strain expressing MoPil1 - GFP To investigate the expression and localisation of MoPIL1 , a reporter gene construct comprising the promoter region and open reading frame ( ORF ) of MoPil1 and green 209 Chapter 6 210 Figure 6 . 3 Cloning strategy to generate MoPil1 - GFP gene fusion . Schematic representation depicting the cloning strategy used to generate a MoPil1 - GFP construct in the M . oryzae transformation vector pCB1532 . Chapter 6 fluorescent protein ( GFP ) was constructed ( See Figure 6 . 3 for cloning strategy ) . To do this the promoter region and ORF of MoPIL1 was cloned from M . oryzae genomic DNA . The clone was then ligated to the linearised transformation vector pCB1532 ( Figure 6 . 4a ) . A 1015 bp DNA fragment consisting of GFP and the NOS terminator from the pCAMBgfp plasmid ( Sesma & Osbourn , 2004 ) was then isolated . The MoPil1 - GFP construct was created by ligating a GFP - NOS _ terminator DNA fragment to MoPil1 ( Figure 6 . 3 & Figure 6 . 4b ) . Presence of the MoPil1 - GFP construct in pCB1532 was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion ( Figure 6 . 4c ) . To confirm the Pil1 211 Figure 6 . 4 Generating a MoPil1 - GFP gene fusion construct . a Restriction enzyme digestion of pCB1532 + MGG _ 00153 ( promoter and ORF ) samples with Bam HI and Eco RI producing a 5 . 2 kb DNA fragment ( pCB1532 ) and a 3 , 385 DNA fragment ( MGG _ 00153 promoter and ORF ) . b Restriction enzyme digestion of pCB1532 - MGG _ 00153 + GFP Eco RI and Cla I producing a 8 . 6 kb DNA fragment ( pCB1532 - MGG _ 00153 ) and a 1 . 0 kb DNA fragment ( GFP + NOS terminator ) . c Restriction enzyme digestion of a pCB1532 + MGG _ 00153 + GFP with Bam HI and Cla I producing a 5 . 2 kb DNA fragment ( pCB1532 ) and a 4 . 4 kb DNA fragment ( MGG _ 00153 + GFP ) . 1 kb + ladder was used ( Invitrogen ) Chapter 6 promoter and ORF was cloned in frame with GFP , the construct was sequenced in both directions with MoPil1 and GFP specific primers . The M . oryzae Guy - 11 strain was transformed with the pCB1532 - MoPil1 - GFP vector and transformants selected by resistance to sulfonylurea ( Sweigard , 1997 ) . 6 . 3 . 2 Sub - cellular localisation of MoPil1 - GFP and MoPil2 - RFP in M . oryzae conidia and hyphae The sub - cellular localisation of MoPil1 - GFP was observed in different cell types and at the different developmental stages of the M . oryzae life cycle ( Wilson & Talbot , 2009 ) . In the three celled conidium , MoPil1 - GFP localised to discrete puncta that were evenly distributed at the cell cortex ( Figure 6 . 5a ) . This is consistent with localisation of eisosomes in S . cerevisiae cells ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . As the germ tube extended from the apical cell and appressorium began to form , the MoPil1 signal became diffuse in the cytosol of the germ tube and nascent appressorium , while maintaining punctate patches in the three conidial cells ( Figure 6 . 5b , c ) . However , in mature appresoria , MoPil1 - GFP localised to discreet puncta , in a ring formation around the central appressorium pore ( Figure 6 . 5d ) . In M . oryzae mycelium , the localisation of Pil1 - GFP was found to be diffuse in actively growing hyphal tips , but in older hyphae , it localised to a discrete patch in the centre of an established septum , or as a cluster of patches during the process of septation ( Figure 6 . 6a , b ) . To compare the sub - cellular localisation of MoPil1 with MoPil2 , a M . oryzae strain co - expressing MoPil1 - GFP and MoPil2 - RFP was generated . Unlike MoPil1 - GFP , the localisation of MoPil2 - RFP in conidia was either diffuse in the cytoplasm , or was concentrated into bright patches which coincided with septal pores ( Figure 6 . 7 a , b ) . In mature appresoria , Pil2 - RFP did not co - localise with MoPil1 - GFP 212 Chapter 6 punctate patches , but was diffusely distributed around the central pore ( Figure 6 . 8 ) . In hyphae , Pil1 - GFP and Pil2 - RFP colocalised to septa and to sparse punctate patches along the periphery of hyphae ( Figure 6 . 9 ) . 6 . 3 . 3 Functional complementation of S . cerevisiae Δpil1 mutant by M . oryzae MoPil1 and MoPil2 The functional relatedness of MoPil1 and MoPil2 was analysed by complementation analysis with a pil1 Δ mutant of S . cerevisiae . To do this , differences in response to stress factors in S . cerevisiae wild type and pil1 Δ strains were identified . Transformation vectors with the coding sequences of MoPil1 and MoPil2 were then constructed and used to transform S . cerevisiae pil1 Δ strains . Finally , stress resistance assays were carried out to test whether MoPil1 and MoPil2 recover wild type phenotype . 6 . 3 . 3 . 1 Differential stress resistance in S . cerevisiae wild type and pil1 Δ strains Deletion of Pil1 is non - lethal in S . cerevisiae and it is therefore important to identify detectable phenotypic variations between S . cerevisiae wild type and pil1 Δ strains . According to Walther et al . ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) , deletion of Pil1 causes aberrant plasma membrane invaginations . However , this phenotype can be confirmed only by transmission electron microscopy . A simpler way of testing phenotypic variation is to look at stress resistance to either heat shock and to chemicals . In Zhang et al . ( Zhang et al . , 2004 ) , the authors report that Pil1 and Lsp1 negatively regulate resistance to heat stress . By performing cell viability studies , they showed that S . cerevisiae pil1 Δ cells , are twice as resistant to heat stress as wild type cells . I confirmed this observation by treating S . cerevisiae wild type and pil1 Δ mutant strains ( see section 2 . 2 . 1 for genetic 213 Chapter 6 214 Figure 6 . 5 Sub - cellular localisation of MoPil1 - GFP at different stages of M . oryzae conidia germination and appressorium formation .

Scale = 10 μm ( Images obtained by Egan M . J . , see section 6 . 2 . 2 ) Chapter 6 specification ) with heat stress at 48 ºC for 80 mins ( see section 6 . 2 . 7 ) . The average cell viability of triplicate experiments was 0 . 409 ( standard deviation = 0 . 053 ) for wild type strain and 0 . 757 ( standard deviation = 0 . 065 ) for pil1 Δ strains ( Figure 6 . 14a ) . P - value for Student ' s t - test on the two data samples is 0 . 002 ( Figure 6 . 14b ) . Cell viability after heat stress at 48 ºC for 80 mins was therefore 1 . 85 higher for pil1 Δ than for wild type . To test for differential stress resistance in pil1 Δ and wild type cells , log phase S . cerevisiae cells were also treated with cell wall integrity disruptors Calcofluor White 217 Figure 6 . 9 MoPil1 - GFP and MoPil2 - RFP co - localise in vegetative hyphae of M . oryzae . MoPil1 and MoPil2 localisation was examined in the hyphae of a M . oryzae strain co - expressing Pil1 - GFP and Pil2 - RFP fusion proteins .

J , see section 6 . 2 . 2 ) Chapter 6 and Congo Red ( Nikolaou et al . , 2009 ) , and with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate ( SDS ) . Mutant pil1 Δ cells treated with Calcofluor White , showed higher rates of growth than wild type cells . This was found for the 1 x 10 3 cells / ml suspension in the 20 μg / ml assay , and the 1 x 10 4 cells / ml suspension in the 40 μg / ml assay ( Figure 6 . 10 ) . Wild type cells treated with Congo Red , showed higher rates of growth than mutant pil1 Δ cells . This was found for the 1 x 10 3 cells / ml suspension in the 200 μg / ml assay , and the 1 x 10 4 cells / ml suspension in the 400 μg / ml assay ( Figure 6 . 10 ) . Wild type cells at 1 x 10 2 cells / ml concentration , treated with 40 μg / ml SDS , showed higher growth rates than pil1 Δ cells ( Figure 6 . 10 ) . 6 . 3 . 3 . 2 Construction of pYES2 : MoPil1 and pYES2 : MoPil2 transformation vectors The 1098 bp DNA fragment comprising the coding sequence of MoPil1 , was cloned in a sequencing vector , and then ligated into the S . cerevisiae transformation vector pYES2 , as described in sections 6 . 2 . 3 and 6 . 2 . 6 . Presence of MoPil1 coding sequence was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion ( Figure 6 . 11 ) . A sample of pYES2 : MoPil1 vectors , was sequenced to ensure the ORF does not contain errors introduced by the PCR or by cloning . MGG _ 11731 sequence information on version 6 of the BROAD - MIT Magnaporthe oryzae genome database ( Dean et al . , 2005 ) , was used to design primers to amplify the MoPil2 coding sequence . However , PCR failed with different concentrations of template cDNA and at different annealing temperatures , whereas in all positive control PCRs , a DNA fragment was amplified using M . oryzae genomic DNA as template ( Figure 6 . 12a ) . The PCRs with nested MoPil2 specific primers generated an amplicon , 218 Chapter 6 219 Figure 6 . 10 Stress resistance to Calcoflour White , Congo Red and SDS in S . cerevisiae wild type and pil1 Δ strains . Cells were grown to log phase , diluted to starting concentration of ~ 1 x 10 6 cells / ml with four subsequent 1 : 10 serial dilutions . 5 μl samples from each of the dilutions were plated on YPD agar treated with 20 and 40 μg / ml Calcofluor White , 200 and 400 μg / ml Congo Red , and 10 and 40 μg / ml and on untreated YPD agar for control . Chapter 6 which demonstrated that MoPil2 was expressed at the time of RNA extraction , and the RNA or cDNA was not subsequently degraded . To empirically determine the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the MoPil2 CDS , rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RACE ) was carried out ( Figure 6 . 12b ) . The 5 ' and 3 ' ends of MoPil2 CDS were sequenced and ligated to obtain the full MoPil2 CDS . The data also demonstrated transcript information for MGG _ 11731 on version 6 of the BROAD - MIT M . oryzae genome database was incorrect at the 5 ' end . The sequence data thus obtained was used to design primers to amplify MoPil2 CDS . The coding sequence of MoPil2 was cloned in a sequencing vector , and then ligated into S . cerevisiae transformation vector pYES2 , as described in section 6 . 2 . 5 and 6 . 2 . 6 . Presence of MoPil2 coding sequence was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion ( Figure 6 . 12c ) . A sample of pYES2 : MoPil1 vectors , was sequenced to ensure the ORF does not contain errors introduced by the PCR or by cloning . 6 . 3 . 3 . 3 Expression of MoPil1 and MoPil2 in transformed S . cerevisiae cells The S . cerevisiae pil1 Δ strain used for transformation is from the W303 strain background . The genetic specifications are ura 3 - 52 ; trp1 Δ 2 ; leu 2 - 3 , 112 ; his 3 - 11 ; ade 2 - 1 ; can 1 - 100 ; pil1 Δ : : KAN . To confirm absence of Pil1 , I carried out a colony PCR reaction with Pil1 specific primers with a control reaction using wild type colonies as template ( see Figure 6 . 13a ) . Three transformed S . cerevisiae strains were generated using methods described in section 6 . 2 . 6 . I transformed a pil1 Δ mutant with pYES2 : MoPil1 and also transformed a pil1 Δ mutant with pYES2 : MoPil2 . The pil1 Δ strain was also transformed with the empty pYES2 vector as a control experiment . 220 Chapter 6 221 Figure 6 . 11 Restriction Enzyme digestion of pYES2 : MoPil1 . An aliquot of 100 ng of pYES2 : MoPil1 was digested with Bam HI and Eco RI to confirm presence of the MoPil1 coding sequence . The digestion produced a 1 . 1 kb DNA fragment ( MoPil1 CDS ) and a 5 . 9 kb DNA fragment ( linearised pYES2 ) . An aliquot of 100 ng of undigested pYES2 : MoPil1 was run for control . Hyperladder I was used to determine size of DNA fragments ( Bioline ) Figure 6 . 12 Cloning the MoPil2 coding sequence . a Primers were designed from the M . oryzae database but failed to amplify MoPil2 CDS from cDNA template . b Amplification of 5 ' and 3 ' MoPil2 cDNA ends .

Digestion produced 949 base pair DNA fragment identified as MoPil2 CDS and 5 . 9 kb DNA fragment identified as linearised pYES2 ) . Hyperladder I was used to determine DNA fragment size . Chapter 6 Transformed colonies were selected by growth in uracil deficient chemically growth medium and maintained in the same media with glucose . I confirmed the presence of MoPil1 and MoPil2 in each respective transformed pil1 Δ strains , by colony PCR ( Figure 6 . 13b ) . To induce expression of MoPil1 and MoPil2 , the transformed strains were transferred to induction media , which is chemically defined , lacks uracil , and uses galactose as its carbon source . To test that both genes were expressed , pil1 Δ : MoPil1 , pil1 Δ : MoPil2 and pil1 Δ : pYES2 cells cultures were grown to log phase in both glucose based and galactose based chemically defined medium . Total RNA was then extracted from each cell culture and used as template for one - step RT - PCR reactions , with each reaction including the appropriate gene - specific primers . For the pil1 Δ : MoPil1 and pil1 Δ : MoPil2 cultures grown in galactose , gene - specific DNA fragments were amplified , for both pil1 Δ : pYES2 cultures and for the other cultures grown in glucose , no DNA fragments were amplified ( Figure 6 . 13c ) . 6 . 3 . 3 . 4 Analysis of S . cerevisiae pil1 Δ : MoPil1 and pil1 Δ : MoPil2 transformants Although there was some difference in stress resistance to Calcofluor White and Congo Red in between wild type and pil1 Δ S . cerevisiae strains , these were insufficient to test recovery of wild type phenotype by MoPil1 and MoPil2 . Instead , resistance to heat stress was used as a method to determine functional complementation because clear differences could be observed ( see section 6 . 2 . 7 for details on methods ) . Heat stress resistance assays were thus carried out on pil1 Δ : MoPil1 , pil1 Δ : MoPil2 and pil1 Δ : pYES2 ( control ) strains ( the first heat shock assay run is shown in Appendix 5 ) . The average cell viability for pil1 Δ : MoPil1 is 0 . 452 with standard deviation 0 . 076 , the average cell viability for pil1 Δ : MoPil2 is 0 . 572 with standard deviation 0 . 081 and the 222 a b Chapter 6 average cell viability for pil1 Δ : pYES2 is 0 . 670 with standard deviation 0 . 064 ( Figure 6 . 14a ) . Because these data sets are normally distributed , Student ' s t - tests were used to estimate statistical significance of the results . P - value for t - test between pil1 Δ : MoPil1 and pil1 Δ : pYES2 ( control ) data sets is 0 . 017 which rejects the null hypothesis that MoPil1 does not reduce resistance to heat stress ( Figure 6 . 14b ) . However , P - value for the t - test between pil1Δ : MoPil2 and pil1Δ : pYES2 data sets was 0 . 158 , which supports the null hypothesis that MoPil2 does not reduce resistance to heat stress ( Figure 6 . 14b ) . I also calculated t - tests between pil1 Δ : MoPil1 and wild type data sets and between pil1 Δ : MoPil1 and pil1 Δ data sets , obtaining p - values of 0 . 492 and 0 . 006 , respectively . These results support the null hypothesis that wild type and pil1 Δ : MoPil1 means do not differ , and reject the null hypothesis that pil1 Δ : MoPil1and pil1 Δ means do not differ . T - tests between pil1 Δ : MoPil2 and wild type data sets and pil1 Δ : MoPil2 and pil1 Δ data sets give p - values of 0 . 043 and 0 . 035 which rejects null hypotheses that the 223 Figure 6 . 13 Expression of MoPil1 and MoPil2 in S . cerevisiae pil1 Δ mutant strains . a . Colony PCR confirmed presence of inserted MoPil1 and MoPil2 in transformed pil1 Δ mutant strains . b . Expression of MoPil1 and MoPil2 was tested by RT - PCR . Cultures were grown in galactose based minimal induction media and in glucose based minimal media . MoPil1 and MoPil2 specific primers were used for the RT - PCRs . Hyperladder I was used to determine size of DNA fragments ( Bioline ) Chapter 6 pil1 Δ : MoPil2 mean does not differ from the wild type or the pil1 Δ means ( Figure 6 . 14b ) . Taken together , this data suggests that MoPil1 restores the wild type phenotype to a pil1 Δ mutant , and therefore there is functional complementation between MoPil1 and S . cerevisiae Pil1 . However , results are inconclusive for MoPil2 because the difference is not significant compared to pil1 Δ : pYES2 ( Figure 6 . 14b ) . 6 . 4 Discussion The phylogenetic evidence presented in Chapter 5 , suggests multiple gene duplications have occurred in the evolutionary history of eisosomes . The presence of diverse paralogues may therefore reflect divergence of eisosomal functions . This is supported by a recent publication ( Vangelatos et al . , 2010 ) , where the authors studied two Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues in Aspergillus nidulans and suggested that the organisation of eisosomes is different from that found in S . cerevisiae ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . They also found that deletion of the two proteins did not affect endocytosis ( Vangelatos et al . , 2010 ) . The hypothesis that eisosomes mediate a conserved endocytic function linked with the evolution of the fungal cell wall and fungal endocytosis , was investigated by characterising the Pil1 and Lsp1 homologues of filamentous fungus M . oryzae . This is important also because of the two gene duplications found in ascomycetes : one at the base of the Saccharomycotina which produced the Pil1 and Lsp1 paralogues and one in the last common ancestor of ascomycetes which produced the Pil1 and Pil2 paralogues ( Figure 5 . 3 ) . Pil2 was retained in Pezizomycotina and Taphrinomycotina but putatively lost in Saccharomycotina . Is Pil2 therefore related to a function that became obsolete for 224 Chapter 6 225 Figure 6 . 14 Functional complementation between Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pil1 and Magnaporthe grisea MoPil1 and MoPil2 a .

Chapter 6 ascomycete yeasts ? The data in this chapter showed that MoPil1 is distributed at the plasma membrane of in punctate patches typical of the eisosomes observed in S . cerevisiae , whereas MoPil2 localised instead at septal pores , and did not colocalise to any extent with MoPil1 . However , in vegetative hyphae , the two proteins colocalised in septa and in sparse puncta at the cell periphery . Functional complementation study suggests that MoPil1 restores wild type phenotype to a pil1 Δ mutant , but the same could not be confirmed for MoPil2 . In terms of involvement in endocytosis , the diffuse distribution in actively growing hyphae , and lack of localisation at the the hyphal tip where endocytosis is known to occur , suggests MoPil1 may not be needed for endocytosis in hyphae . However , recent unpublished data has shown that MoPil1 localises to sites of endocytosis and is necessary for correct endocytosis in M . oryzae conidia ( M . J . Egan and N . J . Talbot , personal communication ) . MoPil2 localisation to septa in both conidia and hyphae also suggested that its function may be related to septation and or regulation of septal pores rather than endocytosis . This is supported by data showing that MoPil2 deletion does not affect endocytosis in M . oryzae conidia ( M . J . Egan and N . J . Talbot , personal communication ) . Taken together , the data lead to the following conclusions : MoPil1 is functionally homologous to S . cerevisiae Pil1 and Lsp1 , defines eisosomes in M . oryzae conidia where it is involved in endocytosis , but also localises to septa in hyphae . MoPil2 is functionally divergent from Pil1 proteins , is likely to be involved in septation and septal pore regulation in both conidia and hyphae , and is not likely to be involved in endocytosis . These conclusions would become even more robust by demonstrating that MoPil1 - GFP localises in the typical Pil1 punctate distribution , while 226 Chapter 6 showing that MoPil2 distributes differently , in pil1 Δ Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells . The putative involvement of MoPil2 in conidia and hyphal septation may explain why it was lost in Saccharomycotina where the predominant cell form is the budding yeast cell . The fact that the Taphrinomycotina species Schizosaccharomyces pombe , where a putative Pil2 homologue is present , can form elaborately branched hyphae which are divided by septation , is consistent with this hypothesis ( Amoah - Buahin et al . , 2005 ) . However , two points can be made against this hypothesis : first , it should be noted that Saccharomycotina species such as Candida albicans , Ashbya gossypii and Yarrowia lipolytica are all pleiomorphic and can grow septate hyphae as well as pseudohyphae and yeast cells ( Barth & Gaillardin , 1997 ; Sanchez - Martinez & Perez - Martin , 2001 ; J . Wendland & Walther , 2005 ) . S . cerevisiae itself , the typical representative for yeast cells , when starved with nitrogen can undergo a dimorphic transition and form pseudohyphae ( Gimeno et al . , 1992 ) . In addition , the loss of Pil2 could be explained by whole genome duplication followed by substantial gene loss and diversification , a pattern which has been postulated to have played an important role in the evolution of budding yeasts ( Wolfe & Shields , 1997 ) , although it should be noted that the putative WGD was pinpointed at a branch more derived than the Pil1 / Lsp1 duplication ( Kellis et al . , 2004 ) . The precise role of eisosomes therefore remains elusive . Some data , including results presented in this chapter , point towards a role in endocytosis ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) M . J . Egan and N . J . Talbot , personal communication ) , but this is refuted in more than one study ( Grossmann et al . , 2008 ; Vangelatos et al . , 2010 ) . The role of the eisosome in the LCB - pkh - ypk signalling pathway involved in cell wall remodelling during growth ( Luo et al . , 2008 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ) and its strong connection with the 227 Chapter 6 transmembrane proteins of the membrane compartment of Can1 ( MCC ) ( Grossmann et al . , 2008 ) points towards a fundamental role in cell wall and plasma membrane integration and regulation . The putative function of MoPil1 and MoPil2 ' s in septation at different developmental stages of M . oryzae life cycle is consistent with such a role . Other distinct functions may also have evolved as a result of the multiple gene duplications discussed here , because it is also shown by the fact that Pil1 and Lsp1 , probably a result of whole - genome duplication in yeast ( Kellis et al . , 2004 ) , show non - redundant functions ( Walther et al . , 2006 ) . It may also be that eisosomes indirectly regulate endocytosis , by recruiting the proteins which define micro - domains across the plasma membrane . This is supported by the punctate and stable distribution at the cell surface which was observed in conidia expressing MoPil1 - GFP . Large , fixed , protein complexes could provide an anchoring for endocytic proteins being transported to sites of endocytosis . Further insights into the nature of eisosomes could be obtained by studying Pil1 / Lsp1 and Pil2 homologues in taxonomically and morphologically diverse fungal model organisms . Dimorphic yeasts such as Candida albicans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe would also be of particular interest , as well as the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis and zygomycete Rhizopus oryzae , for which a system for genetic transformation exists ( Michielse et al . , 2004 ) . 228 Chapter 7 7 . General Discussion In the general introduction of this thesis I addressed the role of endocytosis in eukaryogenesis as an important reason for studying how this cellular process evolved . Out of the numerous models that have been proposed two main types were identified : those that suggest that the first eukaryotic nucleated cell arose from syntrophy between two prokaryotes ( Lopez - Garcia & Moreira , 2006 ; Margulis et al . , 2000 ; Martin & Muller , 1998 ; Moreira & Lopez - Garcia , 1998 ) and those that instead argue for the emergence of a protoeukaryote lineage , either from within or sister to the Archaea , that autogenously evolved eukaryotic features ( although there is disagreement over exactly what those are and in what order they were acquired ) , and only subsequently , via phagotrophy , they engulfed the α - protobacterium which later evolved into the mitochondrion ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ; Hartman & Fedorov , 2002 ; Jekely , 2007 ) . According to the autogenous models , endocytosis plays key roles , both in terms of the acquisition of the primary mitochondrial endosymbiont ( phagocytosis ) and the evolution of the endomembrane system ( pinocytosis ) , whereas models based on syntrophy entail endocytosis - independent processes for the origin of the first eukaryotic cell . With regards to the study presented in this thesis , the question is whether it offers a real contribution to the debate over which type of model is more plausible . The quick answer is no , and that simply is because , using the tools of comparative genomics and phylogenetics , we cannot go further back than the last common ancestor of known extant eukaryotic taxa ( LCEA ) with sequenced DNA data . That cell , the LCEA , already possessed the mitochondrion , as well as all the major eukaryotic benchmarks , thus making it a remarkably complex cell , far surpassing initial predictions ( DeGrasse et al . , 2009 ; Eme et al . , 2009 ; Field & Dacks , 2009 ; Koonin , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ; Ramesh 229 Chapter 7 et al . , 2005 ; Richards & Cavalier - Smith , 2005 ) . Whether that cell evolved from two prokaryotic organisms , exchanging sulfur or hydrogen , fusing membranes , merging genomes , and only then , evolving the autogenous membrane bound organelles to organise the metabolic compartments of the cell ; or whether it evolved from a protoeukaryote cell that had become flexible , phagotrophic and predatory , able to engulf and enslave metabolically advantageous organisms , is not known , or at least it cannot be known via phylogenomic methods , because no bona fide intermediate eukaryotic lineages have been found ( Embley & Martin , 2006 ) . So what is the real purpose of this thesis ? Let ' s consider the idea is that although the actual origin of the eukaryotic cell remains an unanswered question , we do know that the way the cell evolved , from its very first step ( the first common eukaryotic ancestor - FCEA ) to the LCEA , combines element of exogenous and of autogenous evolution . Indeed , mitochondria certainly evolved from a bacterium , but other organelles such as the Golgi , the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes most probably evolved from within the cell ( Dacks & Field , 2007 ; Gabaldon et al . , 2006 ; Martin , 1999 ; Schluter et al . , 2006 ) . Models of autogenous evolution , whether in the context of eukaryogenesis , or origin of organelles , are thus important to the field of eukaryotic cell evolution and are the focus of this thesis . For instance , the model of autogenous eukaryotic origin based on the evolution of the Ras superfamily of GTPases ( Jekely , 2003 , 2007 ) , suggests that eukaryotic endomembranes evolved from tubulation of the plasma membrane to form secretory membranes , from which vesicle scission first occurred ( referred to in his writing as 230 Chapter 7 " topological separation from the plasma membrane " ) , with the subsequent evolution of vesicular trafficking " to sort proteins and recycle lipids " . This allowed the elaboration of a membranous secretory system that could release digestive enzymes and regulate nutrient uptake and therefore created the conditions for viable predatory phagocytosis which in turn led to endosymbiosis of the mitochondrion ( Figure 7 . 1 ) ( Jekely , 2003 , 231 Figure 7 . 1 Autogenous scenario of endomembrane origin based on Ras GTPase evolution . a Secretory membranes evolved following initial membrane tubulations off the plasma membrane . b Scission of tubules allowed separation of tubules from the plasma membrane and led to origin of vesicle trafficking to recycle lipids and sort proteins . c Development of a viable membranous secretory system led to evolution of phagotrophic predation , and eventually to acquisition of the mitchondrial ancestor . The model thus proposes pinocytosis evolved prior to phagocytosis , and that the actin cytoskeleton coevolved with the vesicle trafficking system to support its functional demands ( The figure was adapted from Jèkely , 2007 ) . Chapter 7 2007 ) . Crucially , according to this model , the coevolution of eukaryotic endomembranes and cytoskeleton is fundamental , because membrane dynamics necessitated cytoskeletal support and associated action of motor proteins ( Jekely , 2007 ) . Prokaryotic precursors of cytoskeletal proteins , from which early eukaryotic filament systems could have evolved , notably include the tubulin homologue the actin - like proteins MreB and ParM ( Lowe & Amos , 1999 ; van den Ent et al . , 2001 ) . While carrying out research for this thesis , in the attempt to understand the way the actin cytoskeleton regulates and is regulated by the core endocytic proteins involved in CME , two main types of interaction were identified . As summarised in the actin attachment module described in Chapter 3 , one type of actin interaction is based on direct binding by the endocytic protein to actin filament . This is true for the HIP1 and HIP1R proteins , that bind actin filaments via its C - terminal I / LWEQ domain ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ) , and also for ABP1 , which belongs to a protein family that can de - polymerise actin filaments via ADF / cofilin protein domains ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2005 ) . The other type of interaction with the actin cytoskeleton is indirect , i . e . via the mediation of the N - WASP protein . There are as many as five components of the CME - I that interact with the actin cytoskeleton this way - these are amphiphysins / endophilin , FCH proteins , intersectins , SNX9 and tuba - and they all do so via their SH3 domains that bind the proline rich domain ( PRD ) of N - WASP which in turn activates actin polymerisation ( Bu et al . , 2010 ; Cestra et al . , 2005 ; Hussain et al . , 2001 ; Shin et al . , 2007 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Yamada et al . , 2009 ) . Considering that CME is at least as old as the LCEA , the question is whether these modes of interaction and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , as identified in 232 Chapter 7 233 Figure 7 . 2 Evolution of actin modulation system in the last common unikont ancestor . a The likely CME - I system in the last common eukaryotic ancestor was viable but the model offers no information on how actin cytoskeleton function integrated with the endocytic machinery . b The known system of endocytic machinery - actin cytoskeleton modulation evolved in the last common unikont ancestor . Note direct binding to actin filaments by I / LWEQ domain and induction of actin nucleation via SH3 - PRD mediated nteraction with N - WASP . Coloured bars represent novel protein domains , black lines represent novel interactions . Chapter 7 opisthokont models , are ancient too . In short , do they represent an ancient eukaryotic system of cytoskeletal support of endomembrane activity such as the ones theorised by Jekely ( 2007 ) ? The data unfortunately indicates that this is not the case . The direct binding of actin by HIP1 / HIP1R protein family can be traced back to the last common unikont ancestor ( LCUA ) , because although the N - terminal ANTH domain of HIP1 and HIP1R was acquired in the LCEA , the C - terminal actin binding I / LWEQ domain was only found in opisthokonts and amoebozoans ( i . e . unikonts ) . Likewise , the data from Chapter 4 shows that none of the SH3 - PRD interactions which indirectly induce actin polymerisation are older than the LCUA , and in tuba ' s and SNX9 ' s case they are more recent still , likely tracing to the last common holozoan ancestor . The protein domain architecture of ABP1 ( ADF - SH3 ) , probably originated in the LCUA ( in any case certainly not in the LCEA ) , but the ADF / cofilin protein domain is cenancestral to eukaryotes . However the model presented in this thesis does not propose a mode of how it may have interacted with the CME machinery in the LCEA ( Figure 7 . 2 ) . These results lead to further considerations . Since the LCEA did perform CME and possessed an actin cytoskeleton , but the former was not regulated by the latter in the ways described , there must have been different modes of regulation . It should be noted that a study of the origin and evolution of phagocytosis also suggested high variability of actin regulated phagocytic mechanisms in diverse taxa , but found that the mechanisms of actin polymerisation , based on regulation by Arp2 / 3 and WASp / WAVE proteins ( the superfamily N - WASP belongs to ) are conserved ( Yutin et al . , 2009 ) . So despite differences in CME regulation in the LCEA , actin probably polymerised in the same way . 234 Chapter 7 It is also significant that a large part of the actin attachment module of the CME - I originated in the LCUA ( Figure 7 . 2 ) . Firstly , it increases the number of recognised unikont - specific synapomorphies , further strengthening the support for unikont monophyly , which in large scale phylogenies is moderate to strong ( Burki et al . , 2007 ; Hampl et al . , 2009 ; Minge et al . , 2009 ) . Secondly , the introduction of the SH3 - PRD interaction may represent a significant evolution of how actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis ( and by extension vesicular trafficking ) , mutually regulated , as is also corroborated by the unique presence of myosins with C - terminal SH3 domains in amoebozoans , metazoans and fungi ( Richards & Cavalier - Smith , 2005 ) . The novel system must have proved successful because in more derived branches such as the opisthokonts and holozoans , several more SH3 domains were acquired and combined with ancient protein domains . For instance intersectins acquired four SH3 domains and tuba even six ( Salazar et al . , 2003 ; Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ) . It would be interesting to further investigate the role of SH3 domains in actin cytoskeleton regulation within the endomembrane system . This could be done by identifying and characterising more proteins with SH3 domains and study their function and evolution . In any case , this thesis has little bearing on the issue of the first or even the last common eukaryotic ancestor . Indeed , several studies already strongly indicated that LCEA performed CME ( Allen et al . , 2003 ; Dacks et al . , 2008 ; Field et al . , 2006 ; Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) , so there is no significant novelty other than an extension of the CME model in LCEA . Rather , it constitutes a detailed and comprehensive evolutionary history of CME , thanks in great part to its holistic approach , i . e . the decision to 235 Chapter 7 investigate the evolution of the CME interactome as a whole . The only previous data of note is the comparative genomic study of the CME - I components by Schmid & McMahon ( Nature , 2007 ) , where they indicated presence or absence of CME proteins , but only in four metazoan taxa and the apicomplexan protist Plasmodium falciparum . Clearly , that taxon sampling cannot be deemed to account for the diversity of the eukaryotes , and the results are not considered within a model of eukaryote evolution . However , their study did not focus on the evolution of the interactome , but on the modular nature of this type of network , and its significance in terms of biological systems ( Schmid & McMahon , 2007 ) . By carrying out comparative genomics studies with proper eukaryotic wide taxon sampling , by investigating the phylogenetic distribution of the protein domain architectures that characterise CME proteins , and by constructing a model of CME - I evolution based on the resulting patterns , this thesis adds the evolutionary dimension to the mammalian - biased understanding of the interactome . Interestingly , it confirms that the ' hubs ' of the network , i . e . clathrin and the AP2 complex , which are engaged in a disproportionally high number of interactions within the CME - I , are the most highly conserved proteins studied ( and in AP2 ' s case , the only one to have specialised before eukaryote diversification ) , suggesting that other CME proteins coevolved ' around ' the hubs . This may seem an intuitive conclusion , but the data presented in this thesis provides actual empirical evidence to support it . . In addition , by investigating both the phylogeny of CME genes , and the taxonomic distribution of protein domain architecture , an interesting pattern emerged . The LCEA possessed most of the protein domains involved in CME , which is consistent with the validated view of the LCEA as remarkably complex . However , the phylogenetic trees 236 Chapter 7 suggest that the mammalian CME - I is highly derived , as true orthologues of the query proteins could only be found in Danio rerio , and rarely in the rest of the animals . Presence of inparalogues in all major eukaryotic lineages was only found for clathrin and AP2 , whereas for all other protein families that had widespread conservation , only distantly related paralogues were found for a significant section of eukaryotic diversity . The model depicting expansion of CME - I complexity , also suggested that several protein families arose by rearrangements of ancient protein domains with newer ones . Considering these apparent contrasting data , it seems rational to suggest that while the LCEA was complex , and performed a fully developed CME pathway , further complexity , specificity and diversity of the pathway evolved chiefly by multiple gene duplications and by reshuffling and rearrangements of protein domain architectures . In essence this may provide an example of how a system that is already relatively complex , becomes more complex still . This in part relates to the model of endomembrane evolution , supported by a growing number of molecular evolution studies , which proposes that organellar complexity and specialisation was driven by " iterations of gene duplication and coevolution of organelle identity - / specificity - encoding machinery " ( Dacks & Field , 2007 ) . These protein families include for instance coatomers / adaptins proteins , syntaxins and other SNARE proteins sub - families and small GTPases ( Cavalier - Smith , 2002 ; Dacks & Doolittle , 2002 ; Koumandou et al . , 2007 ; Yoshizawa et al . , 2006 ) . Vesicle coat proteins in particular demonstrate this model effectively . All coatomers and adaptin proteins are believed to be homologous and share an ancient ancestor . Shared mechanisms of vesicle formation , the assembly into heterotetrameric complexes , primary sequence similarity and a similar 237 Chapter 7 pattern of pre - LCEA gene duplications all support a common origin ( Bonifacino & Glick , 2004 ; Duden et al . , 1991 ; Schledzewski et al . , 1999 ) . Additional evidence comes from the elucidation of the tertiary structure of vesicle coat proteins , which indicates that clathrin / AP and the two coatomer complexes are composed of α - solenoid and / or β - propeller domains ( Devos et al . , 2004 ) . Strikingly , the same tertiary structure based on α - solenoid and β - propeller domains was found in the nuclear pore complex core scaffold , which coats the curved surface of the nuclear envelope membrane , suggesting a common origin for nuclear pore complexes and coatomer / adaptin proteins ( Alber et al . , 2007 ; Devos et al . , 2004 ) . The model thus proposes that the full known diversity of coatomers , AP complexes and nuclear pore complex , which localise to different parts of the endomembrane system , ranging from the plasma membrane to endosomes , trans - Golgi network , the ER and even the nucleus , was produced by ancient , pre - LCEA gene duplications of a hypothetical protocoatomer protein ( Field & Dacks , 2009 ) . In fact , in this thesis , no protein family with the same pattern of pre - LCEA duplications was identified , other of course than AP2 . But the respective gene families of dynamins , synaptojanins , N - WASPS , ABP1 , SNX9 and EPS15 all underwent gene duplications which must have occurred during early eukaryotic diversification . This would explain the diversity of these gene families , and suggests that they contributed to the evolution of diversification and specificity of the eukaryotic endomembrane system , after the early endomembrane system based on coatomers / adaptin proteins and ESCRTs was already in place . Regarding the evolution of protein domain architectures , while it has been discussed in the context of eukaryote evolution ( Basu et al . , 2009 ) , few studies have concerned 238 Chapter 7 endomembrane evolution ( Bar et al . , 2008 ; Elias , 2010 ) , and a systematic analysis is wanting . In this thesis , at least seven such cases of protein domain rearrangements have been identified , and they range from the mere acquisition of an SH3 domain at the C - terminal of ADF / cofilin proteins , to the intersectins which remarkably contain N - terminal ESP15 homology domains , as many as five SH3 centrally located SH3 domains , and C - terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor for GTPases followed by PH and C2 domains . Importantly , the model of CME - I evolution presented in Chapter 4 , highlights how the acquisition and rearrangements of these protein domains can significantly increase the flexibility and complexity of the interactome . Therefore , if we posit that a biological system is the result of coevolution of its proteome and that it functions via a network of interactions , it is consequently less evolutionarily probable for a novel protein domain to be acquired and ' fit in ' within the existing network , than for an existing molecular signature to duplicate and evolve diverging functions while still maintaining the potential to operate within the network , and for multiple protein domains to arrange in novel combination , thus conferring increased functional potential and flexibility . This model is clearly speculative and based on only one well studied cellular process . To validate it , several more studies of different ( thought possibly related ) cellular processes would have to be carried out and show consistent results . The holistic interactome - based approach used in this thesis would prove useful for this type of further investigation , because it is systematic and allows for the consideration of the fundamental patterns discussed here . Another important aspect highlighted by the evolutionary study of CME is the problem of the strong mammalian ( and to a lesser degree budding yeast ) bias in existing cell 239 Chapter 7 240 Figure 7 . 3 Asymmetry in the knowledge of CME diversification across eukarotes . a Black branches represent lineages for which CME diversification data is presented in Chapter 4 of this thesis . Red branches represent eukaryotic groups for which lineage - specific CME diversification is likely to have occurred but cannot be identified with comparative genomics . b Results from Chapters 5 and 6 have identified the eisosome as a fungal specific diversification of plasma membrane modulation and endocytic function . Green bars are synapomorphies reported in this thesis , Grey bars are previously reported synapomorphies . Blue bars are novel protein domain rearrangements . Chapter 7 biological data . These are by far the most commonly used model organisms to investigate the nature of the eukaryotic cell . The result of this bias is that the data used to inform evolutionary studies usually comes from a small section of the diversity of eukaryotes ( one in six eukaryote supergroups ) . The phylogenomic study of Chapter 4 shows that CME is significantly derived , and important changes occurred in the unikont , the opisthokont and the holozoan branches . Two problems arise . Firstly , we cannot know anything about how CME diversified in those lineages that do not comprise the taxa where the cell biological data comes from . For instance we can only know about what characteristics the amoebozoans share with opisthokonts , but we cannot know about amoebozoan - specific diversification of CME . Another example is the Fungi . We know that in Holozoa , a series of synapomorphies were acquired that signified a change in the way CME is performed , but what about the fungal / nuclearid sister branch ? This issue is even more dramatically illustrated when one considers that from this study we do not know anything about how CME diversified in Archaeplastida , heterokonts , alveolates , haptophytes , Rhizaria and excavates . That could be as many as 4 out of the 6 eukaryote supergroups ( Figure 7 . 3a ) . The second problem is that we may overlook ancient protein families that were present in the LCEA but were lost in the opisthokont branch . Considering how common gene loss is in eukaryotic evolution this is expected to be the case . Therefore , this asymmetry in taxonomic source of cell biological information , not only limits knowledge of the diversity of eukaryotic cells , but also our understanding of the eukaryote cenancestral cell . Ironically , an example of lineage - specific endocytic diversity is provided from within this thesis . Initially there was excitement over the discovery of eisosomes , as they may 241 Chapter 7 have proved to be a universal endocytic anchor and key to understand fundamental mechanisms behind spatial distribution of endocytosis ( Swaminathan , 2006 ; Walther et al . , 2006 ) . However , the data presented in this thesis indicates that the eisosome is a fungal - specific innovation ( Figure 7 . 3b ) . Phylogenetic and cell biological research presented in this thesis showed that even within different sub - phyla of the ascomycete , the eisosome seem to have diversified in function following multiple gene duplications and a gene loss . Hitherto there has been no attempt to study eisosomes in basidiomycetes , zygomycetes or chytridiomycetes , but given the presence of lineage specific duplications and the high sequence diversity of the homologues found in those taxa there is every reason to suspect eisosomes are functionally diverse . An interesting question is also how the eisosomes interacts with the CME machinery if at all . Indeed , the CME - I is relatively well conserved in Fungi , and there is no question that CME is an important endocytic pathway , so it is rational to predict that eisosomes somehow are integrated within the CME - I system . Strikingly , recent publications suggest that eisosomes contain a domain that is distantly related to the BAR domains of amphiphysins and endophilin , and that they can tubulate liposomes in mammalian cells ( Olivera - Couto et al . , 2011 ; Ziolkowska et al . , 2011 ) . It was thus proposed that the membrane bending quality of eisosomes could mediate the formation of lipid clustering in plasma membrane domains ( Olivera - Couto et al . , 2011 ) . These latest studies also prove the importance of structural studies , and the use of more sophisticated homology recognition system to identify distantly related homologues . In this thesis , protein domains were predicted by the established method of running a sequence through libraries of hidden Markov model profiles and position - specific scoring matrices , but that method did not suffice to detect the alleged BAR domains of Pil1 and Lsp1 . Despite 242 Chapter 7 this shortcoming , the functional study of MoPil1 and MoPil2 provides a credible link between eisosome function and septation in filamentous fungi , althought this link would have to be supported by studies in non - ascomycete filamentous fungi to become robust . It also demonstrates the value of combining bioinformatics with cell biology to improve our understanding of the cell . Indeed , the effective way to overcome the asymmetry problem discussed in this chapter , would be to use bionformatics analyses , such as the ones reported in Chapter 4 , as a platform and a guiding map for functional , cell biological studies in diverse cell types and diverse eukaryotic organisms . 243 Appendix 1 : Laboratory products and software suppliers used in this thesis Company name Address Agilent Technologies UK Ltd .
