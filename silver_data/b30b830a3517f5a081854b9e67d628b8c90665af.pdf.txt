The " Hawthorne effect " - what did the original Hawthorne studies actually show ? Scand J Work Environ Health 2000 ; 26 ( 4 ) : 363 - 367 . The " Hawthorne effect " is often mentioned as a possible explanation for positive results in intervention studies . It is used to cover many phenomena , not only unwitting confounding of variables under study by the study itself , but also behavioral change due to an awareness of being observed , active compliance with the supposed wishes of researchers because of special attention received , or positive response to the stimulus being introduced . At times , the term seems to be used as a social equivalent to " placebo effect " . In social research , there is much critical literature indicating that , in general , the term " Hawthorne effect " should be avoided . Instead of refersing to the ambiguous and disputable Hawthorne effect when evaluating intervention effectiveness , researchers should intro - duce specific psychological and social variables that may have affected the outcome under study but were not monitored during the project , along with the possible effect on the observed results . Key terms context , evaluation , interpretation , intervention , paradigm , worklife . When various types of intervention studies carried out in industry are evaluated , the " Hawthorne effect " is of - ten mentioned as a possible explanation for the observed changes . The term is mostly used to refer to the behav - ior - modifying effects of being the subject of social in - vestigation , regardless of the context of the investigation ( 1 ) . In occupational health literature it is referred to as a nonspecific effect caused by participation in a study as such rather than by the specific intervention measures taken ( 2 , 3 ) . It is often compared with the " placebo ef - fect " , introduced by researchers in pharmacology . Very few authors disclose any knowledge of the studies from which the Hawthorne effect derives its name . Editors of distinguished journals in both clinical medicine and epi - demiology cite misleading dictionaries when referring to it ( 4 , 5 ) . Even well - known handbooks on the principles of evaluation research attribute the Hawthorne effect to the results of an unpublished pilot study on illumination and compare it with the " placebo effect " ( 6 ) . This paper aims to clarify how far the general con - ception of the " Hawthorne effect " agrees with the results of the Hawthorne studies and how useful it is when re - sults obtained in occupational health intervention are be - ing evaluated . The Hawthorne studies Influenced by the " principles of scientific management " , introduced by Frederick Taylor ( 7 ) in 1911 , the Haw - thorne studies were initiated in 1924 by the management of the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Compa - ny in Chicago , Illinois , in the United States . They start - ed with an inquiry into the relationship between illumi - nation and productivity , while the main studies , conduct - ed between 1927 and 1933 in cooperation with the Mas - sachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and Harvard University , were concerned with the effects of changes in rest pauses and workhours on productivity ( 8 ) . The charismatic figure behind the scenes of the studies was Elton Mayo ( 1933 ) , who encouraged management at the Hawthorne plant to develop further their inquiry into the factors affecting productivity . Inspired by the work of Durkheim , he espoused a conflict - free group conscious - ness that challenged the concept of class conflict . In the initial phase of the studies , the effect of illu - mination on productivity was examined . This experiment was briefly described in the principal account of the Haw - thorne studies ( 8 ) . The illumination was decreased step by step for the experimental subjects , while the controls 1 Turku Regional Institute of Occupational Health , Turku , Finland . 2 Institute for Sport Science and Clinical Biomechanics , University of Southern Denmark , Odense , Denmark .

Wickstrom @ occuphealth . fi ] Scand J Work Environ Health 2000 , vol26 , no 4 363 Commentary : the " Hawthorne effect " received constant illumination . Both sets of subjects slowly but steadily increased their performance of in - specting parts , assembling relays or winding coils . It was not until illumination in the experimental room was re - duced to a level cossesponding to moonlight that the ex - perimental subjects started to complain that they could hardly see what they were doing and productivity finally started to decline ( 10 ) . The experiment showed that light - ing did not significantly affect productivity as long as it was kept at a reasonable level . Instead , it was evident that some other factor ( s ) was ( were ) much more impor - tant . This observation provided the impetus for the later studies . The study was continued to evaluate the influence of other variables thought to be of importance for produc - tivity . The further investigations were 1st directed to - wards physical factors causing fatigue and monotony and then continued by means of 4 extensive experiments ( first relay assembly , second relay assembly , mica splitting and bank wiring ) . To allow for good control of the variables under study , namely , rest pauses and workhours , these experiments included only small groups of workers . Af - ter a long series of experiments in the " first relay assem - bly test " , the investigators once more had to conclude that the changes in these variables did not explain the continuous increase in productivity observed during the test . Again some other variable ( s ) , than those covered by the study , seemed to be responsible for most of the ob - served change . Roethlisberger & Dickson ( 8 ) , who com - piled the main report of the studies , suggested that the most important factor behind the continuous increase in output was the improved personal relations between workers and management . This conclusion was based on the annotations of the informally expressed opinions of the workers participating in the experiment , as well as on the general impressions of the investigators . This sug - gestion evolved into a " conclusion " and became the ba - sis of the " human relations school " of management , which soon took over the leading role from the " scien - tific management school " in American industry . Birth of the term " Hawthorne effectJJ The original investigators concluded that the increase in output was partly caused by the experimental set - up as such and by the experimenters themselves . In the illumi - nation experiments , some workers were defensive or sus - picious and curbed their output , while others , overly anx - ious to cooperate , increased their output by " spurting " . When planning the later tests , the investigators wished to achieve a relationship with the participants that would insure their working " at a natural pace " ( 8 ) . As the in - vestigators feared that the workers participating in the experiment might become uncooperative or resistant when taken from their regular work to work in a test room , the supervision was greatly modified . The considerable interest and special attention shown towards each of the workers participating in the experiment , as well as the special privileges allowed them , were proba - bly of great significance for the observed increase in pro - ductivity . The reason for these changes was to provide for a controlled experiment in which only the factors ex - plicitly intervened upon ( ie , pauses and workhours ) var - ied . However , at the end of the study , the investigators were forced to conclude that it may well have been these unintentional manipulations which caused the subjects to improve their overall productivity and thus gave birth to what is called the Hawthorne effect ( 10 ) . The term was apparently introduced in 1953 by French ( 1 I ) , who stat - ed : " From a methodological point of view , the most in - teresting finding was what one may call the Hawthorne effect - a marked increase in production related only to special social position and social treatment " [ p 1011 . Over the years , the Hawthorne studies have acquired the status of a creation myth in social psychology and in the subdisciplines of industrial and organizational psy - chology , management theory , industrial sociology , indus - trial psychiatry and the anthropology of work ( 12 ) . In several articles , there have been speculations about whether the unidentified cause ( s ) of increased produc - tivity could have been morale , attitude , supervision , teamwork , cohesiveness , informal organization , interper - sonal relationships , social unity , awareness of being in an experiment , acquiring skill , or continuous feedback while working at piece - rate in a smaller group . With time , it has become increasingly common to attribute any unexpected result occurring in an experiment with hu - man subjects to the Hawthorne effect ( 13 ) . Criticism of the Hawthorne studies The Hawthoine studies were , in many respects , thorough - ly and carefully conducted . However , they also had very important weaknesses . For the most part , the confusing results of the studies were due to the studies themselves . They contained so many uncontrolled variables that it became virtually impossible to identify any causal rela - tionships . The human relations , which afterwards were considered to be of decisive importance , were not moni - tored from the beginning of the study . The attempt to set the proper conditions for the ex - periment seems to have caused a change in human rela - tions , which came to be of great significance in the next stage of the experiment ( 14 ) . Roethlisberger ( 15 ) him - self remarked , already in 1941 : " If a human being is be - ing experimented upon , he is likely to know it . There - fore , his attitudes toward the experiment and toward the experimenters become very important factors in deter - mining his responses to the situation " [ p 541 . Thus the experiment that the investigators thought they were con - ducting at the Hawthorne plant may have born little re - lation to the experiment which was actually performed , 364 Scand J Work Environ Health 2000 , vol26 , no 4 Wickstrom & Bendix because of the additional variables introduced through lack of experimental rigor . Indeed , it was probably the lack of experimental rigor which led to the various ex - planations given for the Hawthorne effect ( 16 ) . In the opinion of Kahn ( 17 ) , the findings were prob - ably primarily related to participation - not to the mi - nor amusement of taking part in a brief experiment or the implausible response to mere managerial attention , but to playing an important part in decisions that really affected one ' s life . His opinion is based on records show - ing that the young women in the relay assembly test room increasingly took the opportunity to alter their work roles . It was a genuine transfer of power , to a significant de - gree and for no trivial period of time . From the begin - ning of the test there was a substantial reduction in su - pervision . In planning the studies , no definite arrange - ments for supervision had been made . The girls had pre - viously been under the direct supervision of a group chief , who in turn reported to a section chief . In as much as the test room observer could assume responsibility for most of the day - to - day supervision , it was unnecessary to transfer the group chief to the test room . The test room observer was , however , mainly concerned with creating a friendly relationship that would insure the workers ' cooperation ( 8 ) . The workers were consulted , for exam - ple , as to the rest periods in the next steps of the test be - fore final decisions were made on how to continue ( 17 ) . Kahn ' s view is in agreement with the findings of Greenwood et a1 ( 18 ) , who , 50 years later , interviewed some of the employees participating in the first relay as - sembly test . The interviewers concluded that the main reason for working so hard in the test room had evident - ly been to avoid transfer back to the ordinary manufac - turing department , where supervision was considered to be very harsh . In a multiple regression analysis of the original re - sults ca ~ ried out by Franke & Kaul ( 19 ) , managerial dis - cipline , the economic adversity of the depression , and the time set aside for rest were found to explain most of the variation in quantity of output . Prior to the 8th period of the experiment , 2 of the 5 young women were replaced , the main reason being that they persisted in talking too much . One of the replacements turned out to be the new group ' s quickest , most ambitious and most responsible member . This replacement of 2 of the 5 experimental subjects in the middle of the relay assembly test may well have been of considerable importance for the continuous rise in productivity . Another factor that probably affected the results was the economic depression , beginning in October 1929 . The threat of losing one ' s job may partly explain the increase in productivity . Reduction of physical and mental fatigue during rest pauses probably also contributed to higher output rates for 4 of the 5 workers . In addition , the use of an incentive pay system based upon the output of the small group in the test room rather than the much bigger staff of the whole department may also have increased productivity to some degree . According to Franke & Kaul ( 19 ) , however , the effects of incentives in the relay as - sembly room test seemed to be minor in comparison with those of supervision , fear of losing one ' s job , and rest pauses . One factor that has not received the attention it de - serves is the background of the study . In his autobiogra - phy The Elusive Phenomena ( 20 ) , written after his re - tirement and published after his death , Roethlisberger reveals his deep disgust with Taylor ' s principles of man - agement . " My two years at M . I . T . from 1920 to 1922 were a steady disillusionment from beginning to end . Course XV was really a course in ' scientific manage - ment ' and ' Frederick Taylorism ' . It had a profound ef - fect upon me . The extension of technology into social space was repugnant . When I was to meet unscientific scientific management in the flesh later on , I was loaded for bear " [ p 221 . In light of his autobiography , it is sur - prising that Roethlisberger made no reference whatsoev - er to Taylor or his principles of management in the re - port on the Hawthorne studies , which he wrote together with Dickson , even if it seems indisputable that he badly wanted to shoot down Taylor ' s ideas . He succeeded in this mission without ever referring to Taylor ! The swift acceptance of the Hawthorne report was probably due to the fact that it provided an alternative " scientific basis " with which to rally around and applaud for the growing numbers who were critical of Taylor ' s mechanistic view of workers as human machines . Was there really a Hawthorne effect ? It is difficult to base the concept of the Hawtholne effect on the preliminary studies of the effects of changes in illumination , as the results of these studies were never reported ( 13 ) . Of the subsequent 4 studies it is only the relay assembly test room experiment that produced re - sults which have been attributed to the Hawthorne effect . The relay assembly test was designed to explore the optimal cycle of work and rest periods . The productivity of the experimental group increased with each new work schedule . When the workers were returned to the ordi - nary schedule of the plant , with full workdays and full workweeks , and without breaks or lunches , the produc - tivity , surprisingly , did not drop back to the original lev - el . Obviously the workers ' behavior was influenced by some other variable ( s ) than those which the investiga - tors had intentionally manipulated ( 21 ) . Although the management instituted rest breaks similar to those tried out in the test room , no significant signs of increased pro - ductivity followed this measure in the manufacturing departments in question ( 22 ) . Several studies have been carried out to reproduce the Hawthorne effect . In industry , Rosen & Sales ( 23 ) Scand J Work Environ Health 2000 , vol26 , no 4 365 Commentary : the " Hawthorne effect " assessed productivity levels in a furniture manufacturing plant before , during , and after the entry of behavioral re - searchers . They found that the reactions to the research - ers were dependent on the attitudes of the worker . Be - cause their research was generally perceived as support - ive of management , older employees , those not active in unions , and those with a rural background showed in - creased productivity , whereas the productivity of young - er , union - active , and urban employees tended to decline during the research . This and other industrial studies have re - affirmed the importance of the meaning an employee attaches to changes in his or her work situation ( 21 ) . Referring to a reanalysis of the results of the Haw - thorne study , Rossi & Freeman ( 6 ) doubted whether the data actually demonstrated any Hawthorne effect at all . They stressed that intervention does not consist only of the " treatment " administered , but also of everything else done to the target ( s ) as part of the process . Every aspect of the intervention delivery system can affect the out - come of the intervention , and to such an extent that mon - itoring the delivery of an intervention is almost always a necessary adjunct to impact assessment . The original data have also been reexamined by Jones ( 14 ) , who concluded that they show slender or no evi - dence of a Hawthorne effect . He concludes that the Haw - thorne effect is largely a construction of subsequent in - terpreters of the Hawthorne experiments and stresses that a more fruitful line of inquiry would be to explore the social and historical context of the reception of the Haw - thorne experiments . This reflection is in line with the conclusion drawn by Carey ( 24 ) already in 1967 : " It still remains an open question how it was possible for con - clusions so little supported by evidence to gain such an influential and respected place within scientific disci - plines and to hold this place for so long " [ p 4031 . Evaluation of the results from intervention studies In research on humans , the principles of natural science apply when the human being is studied from a biologi - cal point of view . In certain circumstances , it may be possible to study , for instance , the effects of illumina - tion on productivity according to the principles of natu - ral science , but it is definitely not possible to examine the effects of changes in work supervision in the same way . Today , it is generally accepted that all people re - flect upon their situation and react to it when they con - sider this appropriate . There is no need to call this a spe - cial " effect " . In some investigations , the people under study are actively enrolled in carrying out the study , while in others they are left to react as they wish . When an attempt is made to get people under study to partici - pate actively in the realization of the study , the reason for the attempt may be " pragmatic " , trying to make the study feasible or more efficient , or it may be " ideological " , motivated by the intention to empower some community ( 25 ) . In any intervention study in worklife , there will be more factors affecting the results than those monitored by the researchers . When the results obtained are evalu - ated , it is important to comment also upon relevant un - monitored factors , as far as they have been identified during the course of the study . Each factor thought to be of importance should be specifically addressed and ap - propriately considered . If referring to the Hawthorne studies is thought to add light to the discussion , refer - ence should be done on the basis of a knowledge of the studies and their results . Vaguely referring to " the Haw - thorne effect " should be avoided , as it adds more to con - fusion than to clarity . Concluding remarks The " Hawthorne effect " is commonly referred to as an increase in productivity - or even some other outcome under study - caused by participation in the study as such . It is probable that participation in a study may in - crease productivity in certain contexts , for instance , those at the Hawthorne works in Chicago in the early 1930s . However , the available literature does not support the hypothesis that this same phenomenon necessarily hap - pens in other contexts . Over the years several other in - terpretations of the results of the Hawthorne studies than those made by the original reporters have been present - ed . Accordingly , the observed increase in productivity may well have been brought about by one or more of the following list : ( i ) relief from harsh supervision , ( ii ) re - ceiving positive attention , ( iii ) learning new ways of in - teraction , ( iv ) possibilities to influence work procedures , ( v ) rest pauses , ( vi ) higher income , or ( vii ) threat of los - ing one ' s job . All of these factors , as well as any combi - nation of them , can be argued for as causes of the ob - served increase in productivity . The so - called Hawthorne effect has thus become more and more ambiguous over time . Therefore , it is questionable whether the term has a function any longer in the evaluation of results from intervention research in industry - not to mention re - sults from clinical or epidemiologic research in general .
