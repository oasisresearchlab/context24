While much is known about how actin ﬁ laments grow , mechanisms of their disassembly are incompletely understood . The best - characterized actin disassembly factors are the co ﬁ lin family proteins , which increase cytoskeletal dynamics by severing actin ﬁ la - ments . However , the mechanism by which severed actin ﬁ laments are recycled back to monomeric form has remained enigmatic . We report that cyclase - associated - protein ( CAP ) works in synergy with co ﬁ lin to accelerate actin ﬁ lament depolymerization by nearly 100 - fold . Structural work uncovers the molecular mechanism by which CAP interacts with actin ﬁ lament pointed end to destabilize the interface between terminal actin subunits , and sub - sequently recycles the newly - depolymerized actin monomer for the next round of ﬁ lament assembly . These ﬁ ndings establish CAP as a molecular machine promoting rapid actin ﬁ la - ment depolymerization and monomer recycling , and explain why CAP is critical for actin - dependent processes in all eukaryotes . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13213 - 2 OPEN 1 HiLIFE Institute of Biotechnology , University of Helsinki , FI - 00014 Helsinki , Finland . 2 Université de Paris , CNRS , Institut Jacques Monod , 75013 Paris , France . 3 Department of Physics , University of Helsinki , FI - 00014 Helsinki , Finland . 4 Computational Physics Laboratory , Tampere University , FI - 33101 Tampere , Finland . * email : pekka . lappalainen @ helsinki . ﬁ NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5320 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13213 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; T he most prominent force - producing machinery in eukar - yotic cells is the actin cytoskeleton . It powers diverse cel - lular processes , including migration , morphogenesis , and endocytosis through rapid polymerization of actin ﬁ laments at their barbed ends against the cellular membranes . In cells , the rapid assembly of actin ﬁ laments must be balanced by ﬁ lament disassembly at their pointed ends to maintain the cytoplasmic pool of assembly - competent actin monomers . While the mechanisms of actin ﬁ lament nucleation , polymerization , and capping 1 – 6 are relatively well - established , we know signi ﬁ cantly less about how actin ﬁ laments are disassembled to maintain actin ﬁ lament growth 7 . Several proteins , including the members of actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / co ﬁ lin and gelsolin families , are involved in the dis - assembly of actin ﬁ laments . Gelsolin family proteins can associate with both monomeric and ﬁ lamentous actin in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner , and regulate the architecture of the actin cytoskeleton by severing and capping actin ﬁ laments 8 – 10 . ADF / co ﬁ lins , which are critical for actin dynamics in all eukaryotes tested so far , interact with both monomeric and ﬁ lamentous actin , and accelerate cytos - keletal dynamics by severing actin ﬁ laments at the interface of bare and ADF / co ﬁ lin - decorated ﬁ lament segments 11 – 14 . ADF / co ﬁ lins are present in all eukaryotes , and are critical for the maintenance of rapid actin ﬁ lament turnover in cells 15 . Thus , ADF / co ﬁ lins multiply the number of ﬁ lament ends that undergo depolymerization . ADF / co ﬁ lins also modestly accelerate actin ﬁ lament depolymerization 16 – 18 . However , whether ADF / co ﬁ lin - catalyzed actin ﬁ lament severing and slow depolymerization are suf ﬁ cient for rapid actin dynamics in cells , or if additional dedicated actin ﬁ lament depolymerization factors are needed , has remained an outstanding question . Moreover , the mechanism by which the newly depolymerized actin monomers are recycled from ADF / co ﬁ lins for the next round of ﬁ lament assembly is incompletely understood . Another actin - binding protein implicated in ﬁ lament dis - assembly is cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) . It is conserved in evolution from protozoan parasites through yeasts and plants to animals , and is thus among the small number ( < 10 ) of core actin - binding proteins present in all eukaryotes 19 – 21 . Genetic studies demonstrated that CAP is critical for actin - dependent cellular and developmental processes in all organisms tested so far , and its depletion results in abnormal accumulation of actin ﬁ laments and diminished actin ﬁ lament turnover rates 22 – 29 . Moreover , altered expression levels of CAP are linked to various cancers 30 , 31 . CAP is a relatively large multidomain protein , which can self - assemble into oligomers , most likely hexamers 32 , 33 . CAP can re - charge ADP - actin monomers with ATP through its C - terminal half that harbors Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome protein homology 2 ( WH2 ) and CAP - retinitis pigmentosa ( CARP ) domains 34 . More - over , the N - terminal half of CAP ( N - CAP ) , consisting of oligo - merization ( OD ) and helical folded ( HFD ) domains 35 , binds co ﬁ lin / actin monomer complexes 36 , and can enhance disassembly of actin ﬁ laments together with ADF - H domain proteins ; twin ﬁ lin and ADF / co ﬁ lin 32 , 37 – 39 ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . However , whe - ther CAP promotes actin ﬁ lament disassembly by accelerating ﬁ lament severing or by promoting ﬁ lament depolymerization has remained enigmatic . Moreover , the mechanism by which the dif - ferent functions of CAP , actin ﬁ lament disassembly and monomer re - charging , are coordinated is incompletely understood . Thus , the molecular principles by which this ubiquitous and essential actin - regulatory protein promotes cytoskeletal dynamics have remained elusive . Here , we reveal that CAP promotes rapid actin ﬁ lament dis - assembly by accelerating pointed end depolymerization of co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ laments . By determining the crystal structure of CAP ’ s HFD domain in complex with actin and an ADF - H domain , combined with atomistic molecular dynamics simula - tions , we uncover the molecular mechanism by which CAP depolymerizes actin ﬁ laments and recycles actin monomers for the next round of ﬁ lament assembly . Results CAP interacts with the pointed end of actin . The N - term - inal HFD domain of CAP is critical for actin ﬁ lament disassembly in vitro and in cells 32 . However , the structure of this domain does not resemble other known actin - binding protein domains 35 , and thus the mechanism by which it interacts with actin has remained unknown . To reveal the structural mechanism by which CAP binds actin to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics , we crystallized the HFD domain of mouse CAP1 alone ( Table 1 , Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) , as well as in complex with ADP - G - actin and ADF - H domain from twin ﬁ lin ( Fig . 1a ; Table 1 ) . The ADF - H domain of twin ﬁ lin is structurally similar to ADF / co ﬁ lins , and interacts with actin through the same interface 40 , 41 , but allows crystal formation due to its monomer sequestering function . The 1 . 95 Å resolution crystal structure of the tripartite complex revealed that the HFD domain binds to the pointed end of an actin monomer , between subdomains 2 ( SD2 ) and 4 ( SD4 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . In comparison to other proteins associating with the pointed end of actin , including tropomodulin , which prevents elongation of actin ﬁ laments and β - thymosin , which sequesters actin monomers 42 – 44 , HFD domain binding heavily relies on contacts with SD2 of actin ( Fig . 1b , c ; Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . Intriguingly , within this interface we observed a tailor - made hydrophobic cavity in the contacting α - helix of the HFD domain that coordinates Met47 of actin ( Fig . 1b , c ) and thus locks the D - loop to an upright orientation .

Accordingly , mutating Phe162 and Tyr163 in the HFD domain disrupted the interac - tion with twin ﬁ lin / actin monomer and co ﬁ lin / actin monomer complexes , demonstrating that these interactions are indeed cri - tical for binding of the HFD domain to actin ( Supplementary Fig . 2a − c ) . Interestingly , the HFD domain interacts with the co ﬁ lin / actin complex with higher af ﬁ nity compared to bare actin 36 ( Supple - mentary Fig . 2c ) , although it does not make a direct contact with the ADF - H domain . Analysis of various actin structures revealed that actin is more twisted in the ADF - H domain / G - actin and in ADF - H domain / G - actin / HFD domain complexes compared to structure ADP - G - actin ( Fig . 1d ; Supplementary Fig . 1e , f ) .

CAP promotes actin ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerization . Next , we examined how CAP could accelerate the disassembly of actin ﬁ laments . Because the HFD domain of CAP binds to the pointed end of an actin monomer , and the conformation of actin in our tripartite complex is very similar to the one of co ﬁ lin / F - actin ( Fig . 1d ) , we examined if CAP could associate also with the pointed end of a co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ lament . Two HFD domains could indeed be docked to the pointed end of the co ﬁ lin / F - actin structure 41 in a way that their actin interaction surfaces are preserved from our crystal structure ( Fig . 2a ) . However , the HFD domain could not be docked to the side of either bare 45 or co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ lament ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . This suggests that CAP might not sever actin ﬁ laments as previously reported 32 , 37 , but may instead enhance their disassembly through interaction with the ﬁ lament pointed end . To test the hypothesis that CAP might enhance actin ﬁ lament disassembly by associating with ﬁ lament pointed ends , we performed actin ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerization assays by using a single - ﬁ lament micro ﬂ uidics approach 46 ( Fig . 2b ) . As reported earlier 16 , 18 , co ﬁ lin - saturated actin ﬁ laments underwent slightly more rapid depolymerization from their pointed ends compared to bare actin ﬁ laments under physiological conditions . Strikingly , addition of N - CAP dramatically accelerated pointed end disassembly of co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ laments ( Fig . 2c ) . At saturating conditions , the pointed end depolymerization of co ﬁ lin - decorated ADP - actin ﬁ laments was accelerated by N - CAP up to ~ 30 - fold , and compared to bare ADP - actin ﬁ laments the depolymerization rate was increased by nearly 100 - fold in the presence of both co ﬁ lin and N - CAP ( Fig . 2d ) . By determining the depolymerization rates at different N - CAP concentrations , we estimated a K d of ~ 1 μ M for the interaction of N - CAP with co ﬁ lin - saturated ﬁ laments . We further analyzed the ability of N - CAP to bind to actin ﬁ lament pointed ends by performing actin ﬁ lament reannealing experiments . The presence of N - CAP leads to a clear inhibition of ﬁ lament reannealing , whereas mutations in the actin - binding interface of the protein diminished this effect ( Fig . 2e , f ) . Importantly , by using biotin - labeled actin ﬁ laments that were anchored to the chamber surface , and a GFP - tagged version of N - CAP , we could directly detect the association of N - CAP at ﬁ lament pointed end with a residence time of ~ 0 . 4 s ( Fig . 2g , h ) . We also tested whether N - CAP could enhance the pointed end depolymerization of bare actin ﬁ laments . However , docking of the HFD domain – actin complex to the pointed end of the bare actin ﬁ lament leads to nonoptimal contacts or clashes with actin , suggesting less favored interaction of the HFD domain with the pointed end of the bare actin ﬁ lament compared to the co ﬁ lin - decorated ﬁ lament ( Fig . 3a , b ) . It is important to note that the atomic structures of actin ﬁ lament ends have not been determined , and thus we assumed that the pointed ends of actin ﬁ laments adopt similar conformations as observed in the monomers at central regions of actin ﬁ lament . Consistent with these structural analyses , N - CAP enhanced the pointed end depolymerization of bare actin ﬁ laments much less ef ﬁ ciently compared to co ﬁ lin - decorated ﬁ laments ( Fig . 3c , d ) . Similarly , we observed the co ﬁ lin - dependency for N - CAP - mediated actin ﬁ lament disassembly also in a bulk actin disassembly assay ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . Earlier work suggested that the N - terminal half of CAP can accelerate the severing of partially co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ laments 32 , 33 , 37 . Thus , we examined the effects of mouse N - CAP on actin ﬁ lament severing . Consistent with the inability of HFD domain to be docked to the side of an actin ﬁ lament , we could not detect any increase in severing activity induced by N - CAP on partially decorated co ﬁ lin - actin ﬁ laments using single - ﬁ lament microscopy , and only very modest increase in ﬁ lament severing was observed with full - length CAP ( Supplementary Fig . 3c , d ) . Thus , our biochemical and structural data show that CAP does not promote robust actin ﬁ lament severing , but drives rapid actin ﬁ lament disassembly by dramatically accelerating ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerization . Mechanism of CAP - catalyzed actin ﬁ lament depolymerization . To elucidate the mechanism by which CAP drives actin ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerization , we performed structure - guided mutagenesis on N - CAP . Both HFD domains , docked to the pointed end of a co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ lament , associate with subdomains 2 and 4 of the terminal actins via the surface iden - ti ﬁ ed by our crystal structure ( Fig . 4a , interface 1 ) . The HFD domain docked to the penultimate actin molecule ( Actin B ) also associates with the ultimate actin molecule ( Actin A ) through a second surface ( interface 2 ) that does not correspond to the binding - surface identi ﬁ ed in the crystal structure ( Fig . 4a ) . Mutations in surface - exposed residues at both interfaces resulted in defects in N - CAP ’ s ability to depolymerize actin ﬁ laments at their pointed ends , providing evidence that CAP indeed uses these two interfaces for its high af ﬁ nity association with ﬁ lament pointed ends ( Fig . 4b ; Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) . We next examined the roles of CAP ’ s different domains in actin ﬁ lament depolymerization ( Fig . 4c ) . Both the oligomeric full - length CAP and N - CAP were equally ef ﬁ cient in accelerating pointed end depolymerization of co ﬁ lin - saturated ﬁ laments , whereas in the case of monomeric HFD domain > 20 - fold higher concentrations were needed for strong acceleration of ﬁ lament depolymerization ( Fig . 4d ; Supplementary Fig . 4c − e ) . To elucidate whether the difference in depolymerization activities between the isolated HFD domain and N - CAP , which also contains a short OD domain , is due to oligomerization or possible other function of the N - terminal OD domain , we generated an arti ﬁ cial HFD domain dimer by fusing glutathione - S - transferase to its C - terminus ( Fig . 4c ) . Interestingly , the dimeric HFD domain was able to strongly accelerate actin ﬁ lament depolymer - ization at much lower concentration when compared to the monomeric HFD domain . These data demonstrate that the HFD domain is the functionally minimal unit for actin ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerization , and that its oligomerization decreases the effective protein concentration needed for this activity . Thus , we propose that ﬁ lament pointed end depolymer - ization requires simultaneous association of two HFD domains with the two terminal actins ( Fig . 4d ) . Together , these data show that the HFD domain is the main functional unit of CAP for actin ﬁ lament depolymerization , and that dimerization / oligomerization of the HFD domains increases the ef ﬁ ciency of depolymerization , possibly through increased ability to bind to the pointed end of actin ﬁ laments through the effect of avidity . CAP destabilizes the pointed end of actin ﬁ lament . To under - stand the molecular principles by which CAP accelerates actin monomer dissociation from ﬁ lament pointed ends , we applied atomistic molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . These were performed on a pointed end segment of co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ lament , both in the presence and absence of HFD domains ( three repeats with total lengths of ~ 5 . 6 and ~ 5 . 8 μ s , respectively ; Fig . 5a , Supplementary Fig . 5a ; Supplementary Table 1 ) . Simu - lations of the co ﬁ lin - actin ﬁ lament demonstrated that the two HFD domains indeed associate stably with the terminal actins in the con ﬁ guration captured in the crystal structure ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13213 - 2 4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5320 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13213 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications a C C Actin - A Actin - B Barbed end Docking of two HFDs to the cofilin - decorated actin filament pointed end N N Cofilin Actin - A Actin - B 4 nm / 26 aa Ala39 Ala39 C ∼ 5 nm Barbed end 60° b Pointedend Gelsolin Flow Barbedend c + 3 μ M N - CAP 2 μ M Cof - 1 20 s / frame , total 300 s Concentration of N - CAP ( μ M ) R a t e ( s ubun i t s / s ) 1 0 0 2 4 6 8 Control + 30 μ M N - CAP e n = 414 K d = 0 . 978 + 0 . 148 μ M Pointed end depolymerization Filament reannealing 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 n = 56 n = 68 n = 56 C on t r o l 30 μ M N - C AP 30 μ M N - C AP F 162 A + Y 163 A R a t i o o f f il a m en t s w i t h t w o c o l o r s eg m en t s t o a ll ana l yz ed f il a m en t s Pointed end Barbed end Pointed end Barbed end Alexa - 568 - actin N - CAP - GFP N - CAP - GFP Time ( s ) 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 F r a c t i on o f bound NC AP - G F P 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 k off = 1 . 7 s – 1 h Unbinding dynamics from the pointed end 0 g d f 20 10 15 0 5 0 30 40 20 10 50 0 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 0 . 2 s 0 . 4 s 0 . 6 s 0 . 8 s 1 . 2 s 1 . 4 s 1 . 6 s 1 . 8 s 2 . 2 s 2 . 4 s 2 . 6 s 2 . 8 s 3 . 2 s 3 . 4 s 3 . 6 s 3 . 8 s 4 . 2 s 4 . 4 s 4 . 6 s 4 . 8 s 5 . 2 s 5 . 4 s 5 . 6 s 5 . 8 s 0 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 0 . 2 s 0 . 4 s 0 . 6 s 0 . 8 s 1 . 2 s 1 . 4 s 1 . 6 s 1 . 8 s 2 . 2 s 2 . 4 s 2 . 6 s 2 . 8 s 3 . 2 s 3 . 4 s 3 . 6 s 3 . 8 s 4 . 2 s 4 . 4 s 4 . 6 s 4 . 8 s 5 . 2 s 5 . 4 s 5 . 6 s 5 . 8 s Fig . 2 CAP catalyzes pointed end depolymerization of co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ laments . a The actin monomers in a co ﬁ lin - decorated ﬁ lament ( PDB = 5yu8 ) display a similar conformation to the one in our crystal structure ( Fig . 1d ) , allowing docking of two HFD domains of CAP to the two pointed end actin subunits without steric clashes .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13213 - 2 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5320 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13213 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Remarkably , the binding of HFD domains drastically reduced the number of contacts between the terminal actins in all simulations ( Fig . 5b – d ; Supplementary Fig . 5c , d ) . The most pronounced reductions in the frequencies of contacts were between the subdomains 1 and 4 of actin A with the subdomains 4 and 1 of actin B , respectively ( Fig . 5c ; Supple - mentary Fig . 5e − f ) . This resulted in a more open and dynamic actin ﬁ lament pointed end compared to the HFD - free ﬁ lament ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) . On the other hand , the interfaces between other actin subunits were largely unchanged , suggesting that CAP only destabilizes the terminal actin subunit in the ﬁ lament pointed end ( Supplementary Fig . 5e ) . Removal of the HFD domains during the simulation rapidly restored the contacts between the terminal actins ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Moreover , simulations where the HFD domains were docked to co ﬁ lin - actin ﬁ laments without optimizing the D - loop conformation to match with the one determined in our crystal structure were ineffective in destabilizing the interface ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) , suggesting the conformation of actin observed in the crystal structure is required for this effect . Overall , these simulations , together with our mutagenesis data , provide evidence that binding of two HFD domains to the pointed end of actin ﬁ lament , in the mode identi ﬁ ed in our crystal structure , destabilizes the ﬁ lament pointed end and forces the two terminal actin subunits to separate from each other ( Fig . 5e ; Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . We propose that this leads to the dissociation of the terminal actin subunit from the ﬁ lament pointed end , and hence promotes the depolymerization of a co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ lament . Mechanism of CAP - catalyzed actin monomer recycling . To elucidate whether the two main functions of CAP , actin ﬁ lament depolymerization and monomer re - charging , could work toge - ther to enhance actin dynamics , we performed further structural analysis of different actin - bound states of CAP . We observed that the CARP domain of CAP , which binds ADP - actin monomers to promote nucleotide exchange 34 , interacts with actin using a different surface compared to the HFD domain ( Fig . 6a ) . These data suggest that the newly depolymerized ADP - actin monomer could be ﬁ rst handed over from the HFD domain to the CARP domain . However , the adjacent WH2 domain occupies an interface on actin that clashes with the ones of the ADF - H and HFD domains ( Fig . 6b ) , and this could lead to ef ﬁ cient a c b Pointed end depolymerization of bare actin filaments HFD domain docked by superimposing actin inner domains HFD - actin F - Actin HFD domain docked by superimposing actins on SD1 90 o SD3 SD4 Interactions between HFD domain and F - actin SD4 disrupted 80 s / frame 30 µM N - CAP Buffer 30 μ M 3 μ M 15 μ M N - CAP R a t e ( s ubun i t s / s ) Clashes to the ultimate actin Buffer 80 s / frame Clashes with SD2 SD2 SD1 d 0 . 0 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 0 . 1 Fig . 3 Conformation of the bare ﬁ lament pointed end is not favorable for binding of CAP . a Superimposition of ADP - actin from the HFD domain / ADF - H domain / actin structure to the pointed end of a bare ADP - actin ﬁ lament ( PDB = 6djo ) by aligning subdomains 3 and 4 of actins causes clashes between the D - loop of actin and the HFD domain .

However , the conformation of bare ﬁ lamentous actin ( green ) is not optimal for HFD domain binding when compared to the crystallized actin conformation ( orange ) . This is due to the difference in the twist of the actin ( see Fig . 1d ) that decreases contacts between the HFD domain and actin subdomain 4 . c Examples of bare actin ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerization assays ( by single - ﬁ lament micro ﬂ uidics approach ) performed in the absence and presence of 30 μ M N - CAP . d Quanti ﬁ cation of the rate of pointed end depolymerization of bare actin ﬁ laments at different N - CAP concentrations .

To test this hypothesis , we performed gel ﬁ ltration and native PAGE experiments , which revealed that the C - terminal half of CAP , and also the isolated CARP domain to a lesser extent , can indeed compete the actin monomer from the twin ﬁ lin / HFD domain and co ﬁ lin / HFD domain complexes ( Fig . 6c ; Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . This leads to the release of co ﬁ lin / twin ﬁ lin and the HFD domain from actin , and formation of a complex between ADP - actin and the C - terminal half of CAP for nucleotide exchange 34 . Thus , interplay between the N - and C - terminal domains of CAP can ef ﬁ ciently recycle actin mono - mers and co ﬁ lin for new rounds of ﬁ lament assembly and dis - assembly , respectively . Discussion Our work identi ﬁ es CAP as a remarkably ef ﬁ cient actin ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerizing protein and actin recycling machinery , and elucidates the underlying molecular mechanism . Based on these data , we propose a working model for how co ﬁ lin - severed actin ﬁ laments are disassembled from their pointed ends by CAP , and how the monomers are recycled for a new round of ﬁ lament assembly ( Fig . 7 ) . Actin ﬁ laments are asymmetrically severed at the interface between the bare and co ﬁ lin - decorated segments , in a way that most severing events occur towards the pointed end of the co ﬁ lin segment . Thus , majority of the resulting pointed ends are co ﬁ lin - decorated 11 , 14 , 16 , 47 . We show that CAP binds to the pointed ends of co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ laments through its N - terminal HFD domains . Experiments with mono - meric and dimeric HFD domains suggest that both terminal subunits of an actin ﬁ lament must be occupied by HFD domains for ef ﬁ cient destabilization of the ﬁ lament pointed end , and subsequent depolymerization . As CAPs are larger oligomers 22 , 48 , this may further increase the depolymerization activity of CAP by allowing the next HFD domain to associate with the newly available subunit of the ﬁ lament pointed end immediately fol - lowing the dissociation of the ﬁ rst monomer . The N - terminal HFD domain and the C - terminal CARP domain bind actin monomers through nonoverlapping surfaces , and this allows an ef ﬁ cient delivery of the newly depolymerized actin monomer from the N - terminal half to the C - terminal half of CAP , which promotes ADP - to - ATP nucleotide exchange on actin to re - charge it for a next round of polymerization . Thus , CAP work as a molecular machine that drives two critical steps of the actin ﬁ lament turnover cycle ; ﬁ lament depolymerization and d c b Interface 2 : K197D + T202D 1 µm 1 µmmmm Interface 1 Interface 2 Actin - A Interface 1 Actin - B F162A Y163A T202D K197D K154A E155A D158S a Interface 1 / 2 : D158S Interface 2 : K154A + E155A N - CAP Interface 1 : F162A + Y163A HFD Concentration ( μ M ) Concentration ( μ M ) N - CAP Dimeric HFD HFD CAP Dimeric HFD Monomeric HFD CAP N - CAP HFD WH2 PP2 PP1 OD CARP DM OD HFD HFD GST 2 474 210 2 39 210 210 39 C - CAP Pointed end depolymerization Pointed end depolymerization R a t e ( s ubun i t s / s ) 0 5 10 15 10 30 40 0 20 50 0 5 10 15 R a t e ( s ubun i t s / s ) 10 30 40 0 20 50 Fig . 4 Molecular mechanism of actin ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerization by CAP . a Energy - minimized model of two HFD domains bound to a co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ lament pointed end .

Our imaging analysis demonstrated that N - CAP binds ﬁ lament pointed ends with a half - life of ~ 0 . 4 s , proposing that it can remove on average ~ 5 subunits per association when assuming a depolymerization rate of 13 subunits / s ( Fig . 2d , g , h ) . However , further work is required to reveal the processivity of the full - length CAP at the actin ﬁ lament pointed end . Earlier studies suggested that CAP , and its N - terminal half , accelerate actin dynamics by ﬁ lament severing 32 , 33 , 37 .

How - ever , a modest increase in severing frequency was observed with the full - length protein . The small increase in ﬁ lament severing with full - length CAP , which tended to stick on the coverslip surface , may arise from unspeci ﬁ c anchoring of actin ﬁ laments to the microchamber by CAP . This would constrain their twist and thereby enhance ﬁ lament severing 13 . It is important to note that in the previous reports demonstrating the severing activity of CAP , actin ﬁ laments were immobilized with multiple anchoring points on the coverslips . This could complicate the observation of new severing events , particularly when the severed fragments are not able to diffuse away . It is also possible that CAPs from dif - ferent species display small differences in their biochemical activities . Nevertheless , our work provides strong evidence that CAP promotes actin ﬁ lament disassembly mainly through accelerating the pointed end depolymerization of co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ laments . The function of CAP as an ef ﬁ cient actin ﬁ lament depoly - merizing protein is in line with the observed knockdown and knockout phenotypes in various organisms and cell - types , where depletion of CAP results in an accumulation of ﬁ lamentous actin and diminished actin turnover rates 23 , 25 , 26 , 29 . CAP is also an abundant protein , present in approximately 1 : 4 ratio to actin in mammalian cells 23 . Our experiments revealed that full - length CAP can also ef ﬁ ciently depolymerize actin ﬁ laments in the presence of ATP - G - actin and pro ﬁ lin / ATP - G - actin complexes , demonstrating that it can indeed drive actin ﬁ lament depoly - merization under actin - ﬁ lament assembly promoting conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Previous genetic work on budding yeast also demonstrated that mutations ( Phe162Ala and Tyr163Ala ) at the HFD domain interface , which based on our structural and biochemical work is critical for actin - binding and acceleration of actin ﬁ lament depolymerization , disrupt the function of CAP in vivo 36 . These data , together with earlier genetic and structural work on the C - terminal CARP domain of CAP 34 , 49 , demonstrate that both rapid actin ﬁ lament depolymerization and subsequent nucleotide exchange are essential functions of CAP in cells . CAP thus promotes two critical steps of actin turnover cycle , and these two functions appear to be precisely coordinated within this Fig . 5 CAP destabilizes the interface between the terminal actins at the ﬁ lament pointed end . a All - atom molecular dynamics simulations of co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ laments ( consisting of four actins and three co ﬁ lins ; see Supplementary Fig . 5a ) in the absence of CAP , and in the presence of two HFD domains bound to ﬁ lament pointed ends .

In the future , it will be important to reveal the precise structural mechanism and biochemical role underlying the oligomerization of CAP , as well as to reveal how posttranslational modi ﬁ cations regulate the different functions of CAP 31 , 50 . This study , together with a related publication 51 , change the current view on actin dynamics according to which actin ﬁ lament disassembly in cells is predominantly driven by ADF / co ﬁ lin - catalyzed ﬁ lament severing , which increases the number of ﬁ la - ment ends that undergo spontaneous depolymerization 52 . Iden - ti ﬁ cation of CAP as a protein that catalyzes rapid actin ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerization also explains why CAP is so critical for actin - dependent cellular and developmental processes in all eukaryotes 23 , 25 , 26 . Methods DNA constructs . All mouse N - CAP proteins , N - CAP - GFP , full - length CAP1 , the HFD domain , GST - fusion of the HFD domain and the C - terminal ADF - H domain of twin ﬁ lin , were cloned into pSUMOck4 bacterial expression vector ( a kind gift from Inari Kursula , University of Bergen , Norway ) to express a SUMO - tagged fusion protein which leaves a native N - terminus after cleavage with SENP2 pro - tease . For the CARP domain and C - CAP constructs , we used pCoofy18 bacterial expression vector ( a kind gift from Addgene ) . For details of the protein constructs and primers used for cloning the constructs , see Supplementary Table 2 . Expression and puri ﬁ cation CAP proteins and its fragments . All mouse CAP proteins and its fragments , except for full - length CAP1 , were expressed at + 22 °C in LB auto - induction media ( AIMLB0210 , Formedium ) for 24 h in BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli ( from Novagen ) . Full - length mouse CAP1 was expressed in LB medium using ArcticExpress ( DE3 ) E . coli cells . First , we inoculated a starter culture containing kanamycin ( 20 µg / ml ) and gentamycin ( 20 µg / ml ) that was incubated for 6 h at + 37 °C . The 3 . 6 - l main culture , containing only kanamycin ( 20 µg / ml ) , was inoculated and grown to OD 600 of ~ 0 . 4 at + 37 °C shaking at 240 rpm . The culturing temperature was changed to + 13°C for 1h prior to protein expression that was induced by addition of 0 . 26mM IPTG for 46 h . All bacterial pellets were collected by centrifugation , resuspended in 50mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 25mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , snap - frozen with liquid N 2 and stored at − 80°C . All CAP proteins and the ADF - H domain of twin ﬁ lin were puri ﬁ ed using a similar work ﬂ ow . First , bacteria were lysed by sonication in the presence of lysozyme ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) , DNAse ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) and protease inhibitors ( 200 µg / ml PMSF , 1 µg / ml leupeptin , 1 µg / ml aprotinin , 1 µg / ml pepstatin A ; all from Sigma - Aldrich ) , and lysate was clari ﬁ ed by centrifugation . Supernatant was loaded into a 1 ml HisTrap HP Ni - NTA column ( GE Healthcare ) and washed extensively ( > 20 column volumes ) with 50 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 25 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 . Protein was eluted by 25 – 250 mM imidazole gradient on AKTA Pure machine ( GE Healthcare ) . Peak fractions were pooled and SENP2 protease was added to ﬁ nal concentration of 40 µg / ml for removal of the SUMO - tag . Mixture was dialyzed O / N at 4 °C using SnakeSkin dialysis tubing in 1 l of 20 mM HEPES , 300 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 buffer . Next day , the cleaved SUMO - tags were removed with Ni - NTA agarose beads ( Qiagen ) in cases where the SUMO - tag and cleaved protein were equal in size . Proteins were concentrated with Amicon Ultra - 4 10 kDa centrifugal ﬁ lter ( Merck ) and loaded into HiLoad 16 / 600 Superdex 200 gel ﬁ ltration column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated in 5 mM HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 . Peak fractions were collected , concentrated , and frozen by snap - freezing in N 2 for − 80 °C storage . The full - length CAP was puri ﬁ ed with following exceptions . We used a 5ml HisTrap HP Ni - NTA column instead of 1ml column . After dialysis and gel ﬁ ltration with HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 200 gel ﬁ ltration column , the major peak fractions were run through Superose 6 increase 10 / 300 GL gel ﬁ ltration column to gain better separation of the mixture of oligomeric states . Finally , the major peaks from several runs were combined , concentrated at 5 - min spin - intervals using Amicon Ultra - 4 30 kDa centrifugal ﬁ lter , and stored as above . CARP and C - CAP proteins were puri ﬁ ed as above with the exception of usage of 3C protease ( 0 . 01 mg / ml ) for tag cleavage . Other proteins . Rabbit muscle actin , labeled actins , pro ﬁ lin , mouse co ﬁ lin - 1 , capping protein , and biotin - gelsolin were prepared as described in ref . 16 . ADP - actin was prepared as described in ref . 34 . Brie ﬂ y , 30µM ATP - G - actin solution containing 0 . 3 mM glucose and 1 unit / ml of hexokinase ( Sigma ) was dialyzed against nucleotide exchange buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 1mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 05mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM ADP , 1mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 ) for 4 h at 4°C . All experiments were performed using rabbit muscle α - actin . Actin pointed end depolymerization assays . Measurement of the actin ﬁ lament pointed end depolymerization rate was performed using a micro ﬂ uidics device paired to a microscopy setup , as described 16 . In short , we prepared a chamber with poly dimethyl siloxane ( PDMS , Sylgard ) , which was mounted on a cleaned cov - erslip . Micro ﬂ uidic chambers were 20 µm in height . The three inlets and the outlet were connected to pressure - controlled tubes ﬁ lled with solutions of different bio - chemical composition ( Fluigent micro ﬂ uidics device ) . After mounting , chambers were rinsed with dH 2 0 and F - buffer ( 5 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 4mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 10 mM DTT and 1mM DABCO ) . The chamber was then successively exposed to : 150 µl of 0 . 1 % biotin - BSA in F - buffer ; 300µl of 5 % BSA ; 150 µl of 3µg / ml neutravidin in F - buffer ; and 10 – 100µl of 1 – 3pM biotin - gelsolin . Prior to experiments , actin ﬁ laments were polymerized ( 8 µM , > 30min ) in F - buffer . A fraction of actin monomers was labeled with Alexa - 488 or 568 . Filaments were ﬁ nally injected into the chamber and anchored to the coverslip by the gelsolins until desired density . To measure the depolymerization rate of co ﬁ lin - decorated pointed ends , ﬁ laments were ﬁ rst saturated with 2 µM co ﬁ lin , and exposed to 2µM co ﬁ lin supplemented with different CAP proteins . The depolymerization rate was analyzed with ImageJ , ﬁ rst making a kymograph for each ﬁ lament ( function reslice ) and manually ﬁ tting a slope along the pointed end . Filaments , which pointed ends could not be clearly tracked or had possible ( un ) observed pauses 53 or severing events were discarded from analysis . To minimize the effect of protein label on our measurements , we used either 10 % or 16 % labeling fraction of actin depending on the microscopy setup . We did not observe effects of labeling fraction for N - CAP activity in our experiments .

The different states of the model are based on prior structural data 34 , 43 , 44 , as well as crystal structure and atomistic molecular dynamics models from this study . The CARP domain dimer 34 ( yellow / orange ) is connected by Rosetta - modeled linkers to the HFD domains ( magenta ) . Please note that for simplicity CAP is presented as a dimer in the model . ( 1 ) ADP - actin ﬁ laments ( blue / green ) are severed by co ﬁ lin ( cyan ) . ( 2 ) CAP binds with high af ﬁ nity to the co ﬁ lin - decorated ﬁ lament pointed end through its two HFD domains , and destabilizes the interface between the two terminal subunits of the actin ﬁ lament . ( 3 ) The ultimate ADP - actin monomer dissociates from the ﬁ lament pointed end , due to spatial restrains and lost contacts to the penultimate monomer . The HFD domain and co ﬁ lin stay associated with the actin monomer . ( 4 ) The freshly depolymerized actin monomer is handed over from the HFD domain to the CARP domain of CAP , while the second HFD domain remains bound to the actin ﬁ lament pointed end . ( 5 ) The WH2 domain of CAP wraps around the actin monomer , and together with the adjacent CARP domain displaces the HFD domain and co ﬁ lin from the actin monomer . It subsequently catalyzes ADP - to - ATP nucleotide exchange on actin . ( 6 ) The ATP - actin monomer is released from the C - terminal half of CAP , and the free HFD domain binds to the penultimate actin in the ﬁ lament to begin a new cycle of depolymerization .

Reannealing of actin ﬁ laments . Preformed , steady - state F - actin solutions ( in F - buffer ) with different ﬂ uorescent labels were mixed and incubated in order to quantify reannealing . The mixed solution contained 4 µM of Alexa568 - actin ( 10 % labeled ) and 4 µM of Alexa488 - actin ( 10 % labeled ) , with or without N - CAP and mutants . After 4min at room temperature , the mixed F - actin solution was diluted 100× in buffer supplemented with 0 . 2 % methylcellulose , and ﬂ owed into an open chamber made with double - sided tape sandwiched between two coverlips , and passivated with BSA . Images series ( 2 s interval ) were acquired in at least three different ﬁ elds of view . The number of green ( Alexa488 ) F - actin segments were counted , as well as the number of these segments that were connected to a red ( Alexa568 ) F - actin segment , in order to determine the ratio of two color segments plotted in Fig . 2f . Monitoring the diffusion of the ﬁ laments allowed us to determine unambiguously when two segments were connected . Controls ( with no N - CAP in the F - actin mix ) were repeated several times , and experiments ( with N - CAP or mutants ) at least twice . Actin severing assays . To investigate the impact of N - CAP on the severing by co ﬁ lin , we used two different methods , either ( 1 ) by measuring the fraction of single co ﬁ lin domains that have not yet led to a severing or by ( 2 ) quantifying the global number of severing events per µm of actin ﬁ lament . ( 1 ) Severing associated with single co ﬁ lin domains ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . We followed the procedure described previously 16 . Brie ﬂ y , inside a micro ﬂ uidic chamber , 12 % Alexa - 488 - labeled actin ﬁ laments were polymerized from spectrin - actin seeds , anchored nonspeci ﬁ cally to a BSA - passivated coverslip . Filaments were aged for 15 min with a solution of G - actin at critical concentration ( 100nM G - actin ) , so that ﬁ laments become > 99 % ADP 46 . Filaments were then continuously exposed to 500 nM mCherry - co ﬁ lin - 1 alone , with 2µM full - length CAP1 or with 10µM N - CAP . On ImageJ , kymographs of the ﬁ laments were then constructed to follow the nucleation and assembly of single co ﬁ lin domains and severing events at the interface with bare actin segments . For each domain , time 0 was de ﬁ ned at the frame on which they nucleated . We then recorded either the time at which they induced a severing event , or when they are lost due to severing by another domain , merging , or censoring event . The fraction of domains that have not induced a severing event was then calculated using a classical Kaplan − Meier method . ( 2 ) Total number of severing events / µm ( Supplementary Fig . 3d ) . Inside ﬂ ow chambers ( between two coverslips spaced by double - sided tape , we ﬁ rst injected prepolymerized Alexa - 488 - labeled ﬁ laments ( in F - buffer , with 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 % Methylcellulose ) . The solution was then exchanged with 500nM unlabeled co ﬁ lin - 1 and 0 , 1 or 10 µM NCAP . After the exchange , ﬁ laments that remained near the surface were analyzed as follows . The number of severing events per µm was calculated as the cumulative function f ð t Þ ¼ X t u ¼ 0 N sev ð u Þ P i l i ð u Þ ; ð 1 Þ where N sev ( u ) is the number of severing events at time u , and P i l i ð u Þ is the sum over all ﬁ laments i of their length at time u . As the solution does not contain G - actin , the ﬁ laments depolymerize , and the ﬁ lament length thus decreases over time . Binding of N - CAP to ﬁ laments pointed ends . The experiment was performed in ﬂ ow chambers ( see Actin severing assay ( 2 ) ) , passivated with biotin - PLL - PEG and functionalized with neutravidin . F - actin ( 10 % Alexa - 568 , 1 % biotin ) was poly - merized overnight at 4 µM . Just before injection into the chamber , F - actin was diluted down to 200 nM and mixed with 100 nM N - CAP - GFP , 2 µM co ﬁ lin - 1 , and 4nM capping protein , in F - buffer supplemented with 0 . 2 % methylcellulose . Images of actin ﬁ laments were acquired before and after a stream acquisition of the GFP channel ( 5 frames / second over 12s , TIRF microscopy ) . For analysis of binding to the ﬁ lament ends , actin ﬁ laments that did not move during the stream acquisition were blindly selected . The ﬂ uorescence was measured on the two ends of each ﬁ lament , on a 3 by 3 pixels area . A binding event was detected when the ﬂ uor - escence would go over an arbitrary threshold ( same value for all ﬁ laments and ﬁ lament ends ) . As capping protein should protect the barbed end , the pointed end was attributed to the one with the most binding events . N - CAP - GFP was detected in 17 % of the data points at the ﬁ lament pointed end , while unspeci ﬁ c association of N - CAP - GFP at the vicinity of ﬁ lament barbed end was detected in 1 . 7 % of the data points . The survival fraction of N - CAP at the pointed end was then calculated and ﬁ tted with a single exponential to measure the unbinding rate . Crystallization and structure determination . The mouse HFD domain was crystallized with 10×His - tag present , and puri ﬁ ed as described above , with exception of using 5mM HEPES , 50 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , pH 7 . 5 buffer in gel ﬁ ltration . Sample was concentrated to 7 – 10 mg / ml prior to crystal - lization and mixed 1 : 1 to 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate , 12 % PEG4000 ( w / v ) , pH 6 . 1 in using a sitting drop method with drop size of 200nl in 96 - well format . After 2 weeks of incubation large needle - like crystals were observed . For remote data collection at Diamond Light Source ( UK , Didgot ) at beamline I03 the crystals were cryo - protected by soaking in mother liquid containing 25 % glycerol and snap - frozen in N 2 for shipping to the beamline . The data were collected at 100 K using 0 . 9763 Å wavelength , Pilatus3 6M detector , 30 % transmission power , 0 . 05 s exposure and 0 . 1° oscillation angle as a total of 2400 frames . The diffraction data were integrated and scaled with X - ray Detector Software ( XDS ) 54 . The initial solution was obtained with molecular replacement using PHASER 55 and PDB = 1s0p as a search model . A solution with four HFD domains present in an asym - metric unit was found , after which multiple rounds of re ﬁ nement with BUSTER 56 and manual building in COOT 57 yielded a good ﬁ t to the data ( see Table 1 ) . Further improvement was obtained by re ﬁ ning the data with the introduction of translation - liberation - screw parameters ( 1 / chain ) , removal of noncrystallographic restrains and individual atomic B - factor modeling . The ﬁ nal R work / R free for the model was 18 . 6 % / 23 . 0 % with good overall geometry . For crystallization of the tripartite complex ( of ADP - actin , HFD domain of mouse CAP1 , and C - terminal ADF - H domain of mouse twin ﬁ lin - 1 ) , ADP - actin was prepared in O / N dialysis at + 4°C in 5 mM HEPES , 0 . 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ADP , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 3mM glucose , 0 . 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol , pH 8 . 0 . Actin solution , containing 0 . 3mM glucose and 5 U / ml of hexokinase , was transferred to a Slide - A - Lyser dialysis membrane and put on a ﬂ oater device at + 4°C . The next day before complex formation , actin was centrifuged for 20 min at 355 , 040 × g with TLA - 120 rotor . Proteins were mixed in 1 : 1 . 1 : 1 . 1 ratio ( actin , HFD domain , ADF - H domain ) , concentrated to 10 – 20mg / ml and used for crystallization as above . Hits were obtained from several different conditions , and the best diffracting crystal was obtained at ~ 10mg / ml concentration of the complex mixed 1 : 1 in 0 . 1M HEPES , 0 . 1 mM KCl , 10 % PEG4000 ( w / v ) , pH 7 . 0 with sitting drop size of 200nl . On the ﬁ rst day , several small diamond - shaped crystals appeared in the drop . On the third day , a large rod - like crystal appeared while all the small crystals were dissolved . For remote data collection at Diamond Light Source ( UK , Didgot ) at beamline I03 , the crystals were cryo - protected by soaking in LV CryoOil ( MiTeGen ) and snap - frozen in N 2 for shipping . The data were collected at 100 K using 0 . 9762 Å wavelength , Pilatus3 6M detector , 20 % transmission power , 0 . 05s exposure and 0 . 15° oscillation angle as a total of 2400 frames . The diffraction data were integrated and scaled with XDS 54 . An initial solution was obtained with molecular replacement using PHASER 55 and PDB = 3daw as a search model that showed clear extra density in the pointed end of actin monomer . Thus another molecular replacement was carried out , and an initial model for the tripartite complex was obtained using BALBES 58 with 3daw and 1s0p as search models . This yielded a solution with Q = 0 . 787 and R work / R free = 29 . 7 % / 35 . 6 % . The asymmetric unit contained a single 1 : 1 : 1 complex of HFD : ADF - H : ADP - actin . Multiple rounds of re ﬁ nement with BUSTER 56 and manual building in COOT 57 , especially rebuilding of D - loop and connecting loops of α - helices in the HFD domain were required to improve the model . Finally , addition of waters , introduction of translation - libration - screw parameters ( 1 / chain ) , and individual atomic B - factor modeling yielded a model with ﬁ nal R work / R free of 16 . 6 % / 19 . 4 % with good overall geometry . Examining protein − protein interactions by gel ﬁ ltration . For studying actin monomer binding , ADP - G - actin was prepared as described in ref . 34 . All gel ﬁ l - tration experiments were performed at + 4°C with 0 . 5ml / min running speed and 0 . 5 ml fractionation with Superdex 200 increase 10 / 300 GL gel ﬁ ltration column equilibrated in 5mM HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 mM ADP , 0 . 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 . One hundred microliters of complex containing 18 µM ADF - H domain of twin ﬁ lin , 15 µM other proteins was injected to the column and analyzed for elution . Peak fractions were also analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Actin monomer competition experiments were performed as above , by including 15 µM C - CAP or CARP domain to the samples . Peak fractions were analyzed on SDS - PAGE , gels were imaged with ChemiDoc XRS + imaging system ( Bio - Rad ) , and quanti ﬁ ed using Image Lab ( Bio - Rad ) . Native - PAGE . Mini - Protean TGX 10 % gels ( Bio - Rad ) were pre - run in cooled running buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 195 mM glycine , 0 . 5 mM ADP , 0 . 1mM MgCl 2 , pH 8 . 5 ) for 1h before loading . Samples were prepared in ADP - actin dialysis buffer ( 5 mM HEPES or Tris , 0 . 1mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ADP , 0 . 3 mM glucose , 0 . 1 mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 ) at 20µM concentration of each protein , mixed at 1 : 1 ratio with 2× loading buffer ( running buffer containing 20 % glycerol , bromophenol blue , no ADP or MgCl 2 ) and then applying 5µl volume to 50 µl sample wells . Gels were run at 100 V on ice for 4h . Fluorometric actin ﬁ lament disassembly assay . The steady - state disassembly of ADP - actin ﬁ laments was performed as following : 5 % pyrene - actin was polymerized in 20 mM HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1mM ATP , 1mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 for 60min . The ﬁ lament barbed ends were capped by 50 nM capping protein . Subsequently , 0 . 5µM co ﬁ lin ( and 0 . 5µM N - CAP ) were added , and the reaction was started by adding 4 µM Vitamin D binding protein ( monomer sequestering agent ) . Final concentration of actin was 2 . 5µM . Actin disassembly was measured by following pyrene ﬂ uorescence with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407nm on ﬂ uorescence spectrophotometer ( Agilent ) for 2400 s at 22°C . NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13213 - 2 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5320 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13213 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 CD spectrometry . The CD spectra for the N - CAP wild type , mutants and the HFD domain were measured at 20°C with the J - 720 spectropolarimeter ( Jasco ) , in 300 µl quartz cuvette of 0 . 1cm light path length with the following parameters : continues scanning mode with scanning speed of 50nm / min , bandwidth 0 . 5nm , wave range 190 – 260 nm , data pitch 0 . 5nm . All the proteins were diluted to 15µM with 10 % PBS buffer . Accumulation of ten scans for each protein has been plotted as a single curve . Models for atomistic MD simulations . The co ﬁ lin - decorated actin models were based on the 3 . 8Å resolution cryo - electron microscopy structure ( PDBID : 5YU8 ) 41 . The missing loops were built using RosettaCM 59 and RosettaScripts 60 in the presence of the electron density map 41 imposing the associated helical symmetry . To match the experimental constructs in this work , actin and co ﬁ lin sequences were , in this stage , changed from chicken ’ s to rabbit ’ s and mouse ’ s , respectively . Over 1000 models were generated . They were , then , sorted based on their total score and the ones that contained structural artifacts ( e . g . , cis peptide bonds ) were ﬁ ltered out . Molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations were initiated from the top scoring three models ( Supplementary Table 1 , simulations F1 − 3 ) . The HFD - actin complex was isolated from the crystallized HFD domain / actin / twin ﬁ lin ADF - H domain complex and separately docked on to the selected co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ lament models described above . For this purpose , the isolated HFD - actin was superposed onto each pointed end actin monomer , which was then replaced with the HFD - actin . This way , the crystal structure conformation of actin - HFD dimer is transferred to the tip of the co ﬁ lin - decorated actin . The docked models were ﬁ rst locally re ﬁ ned using the docking protocol 61 followed by restrained relaxation with the fast relax 62 protocol distributed with the Rosetta Software Suite . This process was applied separately for each co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ lament selected for MD simulations ( Supplementary Table 1 , simulations C1 − 3 ) . Construction of the pointed end segment for MD simulations . Each simulation was performed on a pointed end segment of the selected co ﬁ lin - decorated actin ﬁ lament model , which was created by slicing the model perpendicular to the axis of the ﬁ lament . The plane of the slicing was chosen so that four whole ADP - Mg 2 + bound actin monomers , and three whole co ﬁ lin monomers were included within the segment ( Supplementary Table 1 , simulations F1 − 3 ) . The segment also contained the two HFD domains at the pointed end in the HFD bound systems ( Supplementary Table 1 , simulations C1 − 3 ) . The pointed end segment also contained several polypeptide fragments from co ﬁ lins and actins at its barbed end ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . To maintain their conformation and position during the simulations , these broken chains were kept positionally restrained throughout the simulations as follows : A layer of residues at the interface with the rest of the pointed end segment were left free ; all heavy atoms near the plane of slicing and only backbone heavy - atoms for the regions in between were restrained with a force constant of 100 kJ / mol / nm 2 ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 5a ) . These partially restrained polypeptide fragments at the barbed end act as a platform during the simulations . This approach maintains both the ﬁ lament - like protein − protein interface at the barbed end and the orientation of the ﬁ lament during the simulations . The protonation states of residues were determined at the neutral pH based on p K a calculations using PROPKA3 63 . Each actin H73 residue was methylated ( N τ - Methyl - L - histidine , HIC ) , and the N - termini of actin , co ﬁ lin , and HFD were acetylated . The topologies for each molecule in the systems was prepared with the LeAP program distributed with ambertools18 64 , which were then converted to the GROMACS format using the ParmEd tool . Each pointed end slice created from the selected models was placed in a hexagonal prism simulation box with its long - axis aligned with the z - axis . The box dimensions were chosen to have a minimum distance of about 17Å between the ﬁ lament and each face of the box ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Each system was solvated with 0 . 15M NaCl solution with the numbers of ions adjusted to neutralize the system . Before production runs , steepest descent minimization and successive short equilibration simulations ( in total ~ 7 ns ) in the NVT and NpT ensembles using the Berendsen thermostat and barostat 65 were performed . Harmonic positional restraints were applied to the pointed end slice during these equilibration simulations . A smaller group of atoms ( all heavy - atoms , the protein backbone , and ﬁ nally only the C α atoms ) were restrained in each consecutive equilibration simulation with a force constant of 1000 kJ / mol / nm 2 . The systems that were branched from the others ( Supplementary Table 1 ; C1 ′ , C2 ′ . F2 ′ ) were prepared by making the suitable modi ﬁ cation ( docking or removing HFD domains ) , removing the overlapping solvent molecules ( when HFD domains were docked ) , and readjusting the box size and solvent atoms for the new system size . Staged NVT and NpT equilibration with restraints were performed as mentioned above ( in total ~ 200ps for simulations where HFD domains were removed , and in total ~ 4 ns where it is docked ) . All production runs were performed for 1 – 2 . 5 μ s in the NpT ensemble with only the aforementioned positional restraints on the platform region . Force ﬁ elds and parameters in MD simulations . The following force ﬁ elds and parameter sets were employed in the MD simulations : Amber ff14sb 66 for the proteins , TIP3P model 67 for water , the monovalent ion parameter set by Joung and Cheatham 68 for Na + and Cl − , an octahedral multisite ion model by Saxena and Sept 69 for Mg 2 + , and a polyphosphorylated compound parameter set by Meagher et al . 70 for ADP . Missing bonded parameters for methyl - histidine ( N τ - Methyl - L - histidine , HIC ) were adopted from the GAFF2 force ﬁ eld 64 . The atomic charges were calculated following the protocol by Duan et al . 71 R . E . D . III . 5 software 72 was employed for multiconformation restrained electrostatic potential ( RESP ) ﬁ tting using an extended and an α ‐ helical conformations of HIC dipeptide ( Ace ‐ HIC ‐ Nme ) . All quantum - chemical calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 program suite 73 at the b3LYP / cc - pVTZ level of theory . Charge calculations were performed with the IEFPCM model in a polarizable continuum with a dielectric constant of 4 by setting the solvent as ether . MD simulation protocols . All simulations were carried out using GROMACS 2018 74 . The equations of motion were integrated using a leap - frog algorithm with a 2fs time step . All bonds were constrained using the LINCS algorithm 75 . The simulation protocols were chosen according to ref . 66 . Long - range electrostatic interactions were treated by the smooth particle mesh Ewald scheme 76 with a real - space cutoff of 0 . 8nm , a Fourier spacing of 0 . 12 nm , and a fourth - order inter - polation . Lennard – Jones potential with a cutoff of 0 . 8nm was used for van der Waals interactions . Long - range dispersion corrections were applied for energy and pressure 77 . All production simulations were performed in the NpT ensemble . The pointed end slice , the platform , and solvent ( water and 0 . 15M NaCl ) were coupled to separate temperature baths at 310 °K using the Nosé − Hoover thermostat 78 , 79 with a time constant of 1 . 0ps . Isotropic pressure coupling was performed using the Parrinello – Rahman barostat 80 with a reference pressure of 1atm , a time constant of 5ps , and a compressibility of 4 . 5× 10 − 5 bar − 1 . Analysis of the MD simulations . All analyses were performed using VMD 81 and in - house scripts . The MMGBSA calculations were performed using the MMPBSA . py software 82 distributed with ambertools18 64 employing the modi ﬁ ed GB model developed by Onufriev et al . 83 with 0 . 15M salt concentration ( frames sampled every 100 ns discarding the ﬁ rst 500 ns of each simulation ) .
