In Drosophila cells , ‘safe’ repair of heterochromatic double - strand breaks by homologous recombination relies on the relocalization of repair sites to the nuclear periphery before strand invasion . The mechanisms responsible for this movement were unknown . Here we show that relocalization occurs by directed motion along nuclear actin filaments assembled at repair sites by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Relocalization requires nuclear myosins associated with the heterochromatin repair complex Smc5 / 6 and the myosin activator Unc45 , which is recruited to repair sites by Smc5 / 6 . ARP2 / 3 , actin nucleation and myosins also relocalize heterochromatic double - strand breaks in mouse cells . Defects in this pathway result in impaired heterochromatin repair and chromosome rearrangements . These findings identify de novo nuclear actin filaments and myosins as effectors of chromatin dynamics for heterochromatin repair and stability in multicellular eukaryotes . Specialized mechanisms promote repair by homologous recombination in pericentromeric heterochromatin ( hereafter , heterochromatin ) while preventing aberrant recombination 1 , 2 . Heterochromatin constitutes about 30 % of fly and human genomes 3 , mostly comprising repeated DNA sequences ( for example , transposons and satellite repeats 4 ) and ‘silent’ epigenetic marks 3 ( such as dimethylation or trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 ( H3K9me2 / 3 ) and heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) ) , but is absent in budding yeast . In heterochromatin , thousands to millions of identical sequences , even from different chromosomes , can engage in ectopic recombination , presenting a serious threat to genome stability in multicellular eukaryotes 1 , 2 , 5 – 8 . In Drosophila melanogaster , heterochromatin forms a distinct nuclear domain 5 , 9 , and aberrant recombination is prevented by relo - calization of double - strand breaks ( DSBs ) to the nuclear periphery before Rad51 recruitment 5 – 8 , 10 . Loss of components required for relocalization ( such as dPIAS SUMO E3 - ligase , or the Smc5 / 6 SUMO E3 - ligase subunits ( called Qjt and Cerv in Drosophila and are both Nse2 homologues ) ) or for anchoring to the periphery ( such as the nuclear pore protein Nup107 or the inner nuclear membrane pro - teins Koi and Spag4 ) results in defects in heterochromatin repair and widespread chromosome rearrangements 5 , 7 , 8 . Relocalization is likely to prevent aberrant recombination by separating damaged DNAs from similar repeats on non - homologous chromosomes , while promoting ‘safe’ exchanges with the sister chromosome or homologue 1 , 2 , 5 – 8 . A similar relocalization to outside heterochromatic ‘chromocentres’ occurs during homologous recombination in mouse cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle 6 , 11 , 12 . The mechanisms that drive this notable movement remain to be identified . Actin nucleators drive DSB relocalization Nuclear actin filaments ( F - actin ) form in response to DSBs in mam - malian cells and have poorly understood functions in repair 13 – 15 . We tested the role of actin polymerization in relocalization of heterochro - matic DSBs . In Drosophila cells , repair sites start to leave the hetero - chromatin domain 10 min after the induction of DSBs with ionizing radiation ( IR ) , resulting in a decrease in repair sites ( γ H2Av foci ) in DAPI - bright heterochromatin and an increase at the nuclear periphery 60 min after IR 5 , 7 . Inhibition of actin polymerization with latrun - culin B ( LatB ) increases the number of γ H2Av foci in DAPI - bright heterochromatin 60 min after IR , without affecting the total number of foci ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . Similarly , activation of the Arp2 / 3 actin nucleator by RNA interference ( RNAi ) or CK666 treatment results in more foci remaining in DAPI - bright heterochromatin and fewer reaching the nuclear periphery , consistent with relocalization defects ( Fig . 1a , Extended Data Fig . 1b – e ) . Removal of LatB or CK666 reverses the effects ( Extended Data Fig . 1f , g ) , ruling out permanent damage to repair pathways . RNAi of the actin nucleators Spire and Dia does not affect relocalization , revealing a specific role of Arp2 / 3 ( Extended Data Fig . 1h ) . The kinetics of relocalization are comparable in mouse cells , and are similarly affected by ARP3 RNAi or treatment with LatB or CK666 ( Fig . 1b , Extended Data Fig . 1i – k ) , suggesting that relocalization pathways are conserved . Arp2 / 3 is activated by the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein family ( Wash , Scar , Whamy and Wasp in Drosophila ) . Depletion of Wash or Scar , but not of Whamy or Wasp , causes relocalization defects ( Fig . 1c , Extended Data Fig . 1l ) . Depletion of Arp2 / 3 alone , Scar and Wash together , or Arp2 / 3 , Scar and Wash together , results in similar relo - calization defects , whereas depletion of Scar or Wash alone results in an intermediate phenotype ( Fig . 1c ) , suggesting that Scar and Wash independently activate Arp2 / 3 for relocalization . Arp2 / 3 is not required for early repair steps ( formation of foci containing Mdc1 ( also known as Mu2 in Drosophila ) , Atrip ( also known as mus304 ) , Smc6 or Nse2 , or suppression of Rad51 foci inside the heterochromatin domain 5 , 7 , 8 ; Extended Data Fig . 2a – c ) , suggesting that actin nucleation mediates relocalization after resection and recruitment of the Smc5 / 6 complex . Epistatic analyses place Smc5 / 6 and Arp2 / 3 in the same pathway for relocalization ( Fig . 1d , Extended Data Fig . 2e ) , and Arp2 / 3 co - immunoprecipitates with the Smc5 / 6 complex in response to IR ( Fig . 1e , Extended Data Fig . 2f ) , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 has a direct role in heterochromatin repair . Accordingly , Arp2 / 3 is enriched at repair foci in DAPI - bright heterochromatin 10 min after IR ( before relo - calization 5 , 7 ) , and most Arp2 / 3 - containing foci colocalize with the 1 Department of Molecular and Computational Biology , University of Southern California , Los Angeles , CA , USA . 2 Present address : Karolinska Institute , Stockholm , Sweden . 3 These authors contributed equally : Christopher P .

Article reSeArcH heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 ( Fig . 1f , Extended Data Fig . 2d , g , h ) . The Smc5 / 6 complex , or Smc5 / 6 - dependent SUMOylation , might promote activation of Arp2 / 3 or its recruitment to DSBs . However , RNAi of Smc5 / 6 or SUMO E3 - ligases does not affect recruitment of Arp2 / 3 to foci ( Fig . 1g ) , suggesting a role for Smc5 / 6 in the regulation of Arp2 / 3 . Recruitment of Arp2 / 3 to repair foci depends on the DSB signalling protein Mre11 and the heterochromatin com - ponent HP1a ( Fig . 1g , Extended Data Fig . 2i ) , suggesting that the concerted activity of these factors is responsible for targeting Arp2 / 3 specifically to heterochromatic DSBs . We conclude that Arp2 / 3 is recruited to heterochromatic breaks by Mre11 and HP1a , and medi - ates relocalization of DSBs to the nuclear periphery in concert with Smc5 / 6 . Nuclear F - actin is required for relocalization The presence of Arp2 / 3 at heterochromatic DSBs suggests that actin polymerizes at these sites to promote relocalization . We targeted to the nucleus a GFP - tagged F - actin chromobody ( F - actCB – GFP – NLS ) to visualize nuclear actin filaments in vivo without altering actin lev - els ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) . Before IR , this marker displays a diffuse nuclear signal , but IR induces the formation of striking filaments surrounding the heterochromatin domain and reaching the nuclear periphery ( Fig . 2a , Extended Data Fig . 3b , Supplementary Videos 1 , 2 ) . Phalloidin staining of cells with or without the chromobody indicates that these are canonical actin filaments ( Extended Data Fig . 3c , d ) . Consistent with a role for Arp2 / 3 in filament assembly , filaments are enriched for Arp2 / 3 ( Extended Data Fig . 3e ) , disrupted by Arp2 / 3 RNAi or CK666 treatment ( Fig . 2b ) , and characterized by branching at a 70 ± 7° angle 16 ( Extended Data Fig . 3f ) . Filaments form concurrently with DSB departure from the hetero - chromatin domain ( 10 – 30 min after IR 5 , 7 ) , persist for about 25 min on average , are highly dynamic ( suggesting actin remodelling 17 ) , and progressively disappear during relocalization of DSBs to the nuclear periphery ( 30 – 60 min after IR 7 ) ( Fig . 2a – c , Extended Data Figs . 3b , c , g , 4a , Supplementary Videos 2 , 3 ) . Most filaments originate from repair foci and the periphery of the heterochromatin domain ( Extended Data Fig . 4b ) . Nearly all filaments ( 98 . 6 % ) remain outside the domain dur - ing elongation , suggesting that they tend to polymerize away from the domain . Filament length spans the distance between the hetero - chromatin domain periphery and the nuclear periphery ( Extended Data Fig . 4c ) . Repair foci decorate actin filaments in fixed samples and travel along the filaments in time - lapse experiments ( Fig . 2c , Extended Data Figs . 3d , 4a , Supplementary Video 3 ) . Together , these data suggest that actin filaments have a direct role in relocalization of heterochro - matic repair sites to the nuclear periphery . Triton extraction partially destabilizes actin filaments , resulting in residual chromobody signals that colocalize with phalloidin and repair sites ( Extended Data Fig . 3d ) . Similar colocalization occurs in cells expressing Flag – NLS - tagged wild - type actin ( actin ( WT ) ) , but not in cells expressing a non - polymerizable R62D mutant ( actin ( R62D ) ; Fig . 2d , Extended Data Fig . 4e ) , supporting the presence of F - actin at repair sites . Colocalization between F - actin and DSBs peaks 10 – 60 min after IR , followed by a marked decline ( Fig . 2d ) . This reduction is likely to result from actin depolymerization , given that expression of a filament - stabilizing S14C mutant induces persistent colocalization ( Fig . 2d , Extended Data Fig . 4e ) . Furthermore , consistent with a role of Arp2 / 3 in filament formation , colocalization between DSBs and F - actin is affected by RNAi of Arp2 / 3 or Scar and Wash ( Extended Data Fig . 4f ) . Thus , Arp2 / 3 , Scar and Wash are required to form F - actin at DSBs , with a peak of polymerization during relocalization followed by depolymerization . We directly tested the role of nuclear F - actin in the relocalization of heterochromatic DSBs by investigating the effect of blocking actin polymerization in the nucleus without altering cytoplasmic F - actin . We expressed actin ( WT ) or actin ( R62D ) in the nucleus while blocking nuclear import of endogenous actin by RNAi depletion of the actin - specific importin Ipo9 .

We conclude that nuclear actin polymerizes at repair sites , forms long filaments that reach the nuclear periphery and is required for relocal - ization of heterochromatic DSBs along the filaments . Relocalization relies on nuclear myosins Myosins I and V have been proposed to mediate nuclear dynamics along actin filaments in human cells , including for gene repositioning during transcription 18 , 19 , chromosome territory reorganization 20 and viral infection 21 . In Drosophila cells , simultaneous RNAi depletion of myosin I ( Myo1A and Myo1B ) and myosin V ( MyoV ) results in defective relocalization of heterochromatic DSBs ( Fig . 3a , Extended Data Fig . 5a – c ) . Relocalization is also impaired after nuclear expression of dominant - negative mutants of MyoV ( NLS - tagged MyoV headless or MyoV tail ; Fig . 3a , Extended Data Fig . 5b ) , consistent with a nuclear function of myosins in relocalization . Similar relocalization defects occur after RNAi depletion of Unc45 ( Fig . 3a , Extended Data Fig . 5a – c ) , which is required for myosin stabil - ity and function . Epistasis analyses reveal that each myosin contributes independently to relocalization , and myosins and Unc45 work in the same pathway as Smc5 / 6 for relocalization ( Fig . 3b , Extended Data Fig . 5d , e ) . Similar to Arp2 / 3 RNAi , myosin or Unc45 RNAi does not affect early repair steps ( formation of foci containing Mdc1 , Atrip , Smc6 or Nse2 , or suppression of Rad51 focus formation inside the domain ) ( Extended Data Figs . 5f , g , 6a ) , suggesting that myosins act after resec - tion and Smc5 / 6 recruitment . Myosins , and not other early repair com - ponents , co - immunoprecipitate with Smc5 / 6 in response to IR ( Fig . 3c , Extended Data Fig . 6b , c ) , consistent with a direct interaction between Smc5 / 6 and myosins for relocalization . Myosins and Unc45 are enriched at heterochromatic DSBs before relocalization ( Fig . 3d , Extended Data Fig . 6e , f ) , consistent with a specific role in heterochromatin repair . Similarly to Arp2 / 3 , recruitment of myosin to DSBs relies on Mre11 and HP1a , suggesting that the concerted activity of these factors is required to target myosin to heterochromatic DSBs ( Fig . 3e ) . Additionally , recruitment of Unc45 , but not of myosins , to DSBs relies on Smc5 / 6 and SUMO E3 - ligases ( Fig . 3e ) . This suggests that recruitment of Unc45 to a pre - assembled relocalization machinery ( Arp2 / 3 , F - actin and myosins ) is the trig - ger for myosin activation and repair site relocalization downstream of Smc5 / 6 . The MyoV headless or MyoV tail mutations affect the ability of MyoV to walk along actin filaments , suggesting that this function is required for relocalization . Similarly , treatment of cells with the myosin inhibitor 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxide ( BDM ) or the MyoV inhibitor MyoVin , which interfere with myosin movement along actin filaments , results in reversible relocalization defects ( Extended Data Fig . 6g , h ) . BDM and MyoVin also affect relocalization in mouse cells ( Extended Data Fig . 6i ) . We conclude that Smc5 / 6 interacts with nuclear myosins and recruits Unc45 to heterochromatic DSBs , and that this enables relo - calization of repair sites through the ability of myosins to walk along actin filaments . Directed motions of heterochromatic DSBs Nuclear actin might generate filamentous structures for myosin - mediated trafficking of heterochromatic repair sites , resulting in directed motion 22 . Alternatively , F - actin and myosin could contribute to relo - calization indirectly , for example by local chromatin changes enabling DNA ‘looping’ from the domain 23 followed by Brownian motion and anchoring at the nuclear periphery . To distinguish Brownian from directed motion , we investigated the biophysical properties of the motion by tracking Mdc1 foci and calculating the mean - square dis - placement ( MSD ) 24 of focus trajectory in Drosophila cells . MSD curves for heterochromatic foci have a higher plateau than those for euchromatic foci ( Fig . 4a , Extended Data Fig . 7a ) , showing that heterochromatic foci explore a larger space 24 . This is particularly notable considering that undamaged sites that are embedded in het - erochromatin , such as centromeres , display little mobility ( Fig . 4a ) . Heterochromatic foci that reach the nuclear periphery during the 1 - h time - lapse ( about 20 % of all heterochromatic foci ) are the most dynamic , while foci that stay inside the heterochromatin domain , move to the domain periphery or persist at the domain periphery show limited mobility ( Fig . 4b , Extended Data Fig . 7b ) . Consistent with a specialized role for the nuclear periphery in heterochromatin repair 7 , euchromatic DSBs rarely move to the nuclear periphery ( Extended Data Fig . 7c ) . 0 1 2 0 20 40 60 F - actCB – GFP – NLS HP1a Time ( min ) 0 20 40 60 Time ( min ) A v e r a g e nu m b e r o f ac t i n fi l a m e n t s p e r ce ll – IR + IR c DAPI γ H2Av γ H2Av foci + actin 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 100 200 Actin ( WT ) Actin ( R62D ) Actin ( S14C ) * * * * * * * * Time after IR ( min ) Time after IR ( min ) Actin ( WT ) e 0 100 200 DAPI - bright 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 Actin ( WT ) Actin ( R62D ) * * * * * F - actCB – GFP – NLS Mdc1 time 0 ′ 14 ′ 0 ′ 2 ′ 4 ′ 6 ′ 8 ′ 10 ′ d 25 ′ 30 ′ 35 ′ 0 ′ 50 ′ 55 ′ a b 0 1 2 DMSOCK666 Control RNAi Arp2 / 3 RNAi * * * A v e r a g e γ H 2 A v f o c i p e r ce ll A v e r a g e γ H 2 A v f o c i p e r ce ll A v e r a g e nu m b e r o f ac t i n fi l a m e n t s p e r ce ll F - actCB – GFP – NLS Fig . 2 | Nuclear F - actin is required for relocalization . a , Frames from Supplementary Video 2 and quantification of Kc cells expressing F - actCB – GFP – NLS and mCherry – HP1a ( heterochromatin mark 5 ) show dynamic filaments in cells treated ( + ) or not treated ( − ) with IR .

Article reSeArcH While MSD curves reaching a plateau typically describe Brownian motion in a confined space 24 , similar plots also result from averag - ing MSD curves of asynchronous foci each characterized by different types of motion 22 , 24 . Indeed , application of a computational method 24 unmasks long - lasting directed motions ( LDMs ) associated with nearly all heterochromatic foci , mostly occurring between the heterochro - matin domain periphery and the nuclear periphery ( Fig . 4c , Extended Data Fig . 7d – f ) . LDMs last 24 ± 2 min ( mean ± s . e . m . ) , consistent with the average duration of nuclear actin filaments , and are characterized by an average speed of 0 . 148 ± 0 . 01 µ m min − 1 , consistent with previously described F - actin and myosin - driven chromatin motions 18 , 25 . Depletion of Arp2 / 3 or Unc45 substantially affects the dynamics of heterochromatic foci by reducing the plateaus of MSD curves , the number of foci leaving the domain and LDM frequency ( Fig . 4d , e , Extended Data Fig . 7b ) . Conversely , these depletions do not affect focus dynamics in euchromatin ( Fig . 4d , Extended Data Fig . 7g ) , highlight - ing a specialized role for Arp2 / 3 and Unc45 in the directed motion of heterochromatic DSBs . Notably , Arp2 / 3 ( but not Unc45 ) mediates focus clustering in euchromatin and not in heterochromatin ( Extended Data Fig . 7h ) , revealing that Arp2 / 3 has distinct functions in the two domains and suggesting that focus clustering does not require extensive dynamics in Drosophila cells . The role of Arp2 / 3 and actin polymeriza - tion in focus clustering is conserved in human cells 26 . We conclude that nuclear actin filaments enable the myosin - dependent directed motion of heterochromatic repair sites to the nuclear periphery . Importance for heterochromatin integrity These results show that nuclear F - actin and myosins drive the relocal - ization of heterochromatic DSBs , suggesting that these components are important for heterochromatin repair . We directly tested this by determining the biological consequences of inactivating nuclear actin polymerization or myosins . Defective heterochromatin repair results in persistent γ H2Av foci associated with the heterochromatin domain 20 h after IR in fly cells 7 and 16 – 24 h after IR in mouse cells 27 ( that is , at time points when repair is largely completed in euchroma - tin 7 , 27 ) . Similar defects occur after disruption of homologous pairing ( Slmb RNAi ) or sister chromatid cohesion ( Rad21 and Slmb RNAi ) in Drosophila ( Extended Data Fig . 8a – c ) , consistent with the importance of both homologous templates for heterochromatin repair 10 . Persistent foci occur after RNAi depletion of Arp2 / 3 , myosins and Unc45 , or upon nuclear expression of a non - polymerizable form of actin in fly cells or ARP3 RNAi in mouse cells ( Fig . 5a , b , Extended Data Fig . 8d , e ) . These depletions also impair fly cell survival after IR ( Fig . 5c ) . We conclude that Arp2 / 3 , nuclear F - actin and myosins are critical for the timely progression of heterochromatin repair . Inactivation of myosins or of actin polymerization triggers the formation of IR - induced heterochromatic micronuclei in fly and mouse cells ( Fig . 5d , e , Extended Data Fig . 8f , g ) , and genome instability in Drosophila larval neuroblasts ( Fig . 5f , Extended Data Fig . 8h , i ) .

Chromosome rearrangements include aneuploidies , chromosome fusions and changes in the number of satellites ( Fig . 5f ) ; most of which involve the heterochromatic fourth and Y chromosomes , or pericentromeric regions , as expected for defective heterochromatin repair 7 ( Extended Data Fig . 8i ) . We conclude that Arp2 / 3 - dependent nuclear actin polym - erization and myosins are critical for heterochromatin repair and sta - bility in Drosophila cells and tissues , and in mouse cells . Discussion Our results revealed a notable role of F - actin and myosins in the directed motion of heterochromatic DSBs to the nuclear periphery . To our knowledge , we have shown for the first time by live imaging the forma - tion , structure and remodelling of IR - induced nuclear actin filaments and the movement of repair sites along them . Filaments form at repair sites , reach the nuclear periphery and disassemble after relocalization . We have also identified a specialized network of proteins that coordi - nates heterochromatin dynamics and nuclear actin filament formation in concert with Smc5 / 6 , including Arp2 / 3 ; the Arp2 / 3 activators Scar and Wash ; the nuclear myosins Myo1A , Myo1B and MyoV ; and the myosin activator Unc45 . Arp2 / 3 and myosins are targeted to hetero - chromatic DSBs by Mre11 and the heterochromatin component HP1a . Recruitment of Unc45 also requires Smc5 / 6 and SUMO E3 - ligases , suggesting that Unc45 is a trigger for the myosin - dependent movement Fig . 5 | Nuclear F - actin and myosins promote heterochromatin integrity . a , Immunofluorescence and quantification of γ H2Av foci associated with H3K9me2 in Kc cells fixed 20 h after IR , after indicated RNAi or expression of actin forms . * * * * P < 0 . 0001 , n ≥ 68 cells per RNAi and n > 220 cells per actin - expressing line . b , As in a except NIH3T3 G2 cells stained for γ H2AX and PH3 . * * * * P < 0 . 0001 , * * * P = 0 . 0008 , n ≥ 20 cells per RNAi . c , IR sensitivity of Kc cells after indicated RNAi or expression of actin forms .

DSBs are resected inside the heterochromatin domain ; Mre11 and HP1a promote the loading of Arp2 / 3 and nuclear myosins to DSBs ; activation of Arp2 / 3 by Scar and Wash induces formation of actin filaments that reach the nuclear periphery ; Unc45 recruitment by Smc5 / 6 activates nuclear myosins to ‘walk’ along filaments , thus relocalizing DSBs to nuclear pores or inner nuclear membrane proteins ( INMPs ) 5 , 7 , 8 ; homologous recombination continues while filaments disassemble . Relocalization prevents ectopic recombination by isolating damaged sites and their homologous templates ( grey lines ) from undamaged heterochromatic repeats before strand invasion . a d f + H3K9me2 – H3K9me2 Chromosome fusions Abnormal number of satellites Aneuploidy A v e r a g e m i c r o nu c l e i p e r ce ll A v e r a g e m i c r o nu c l e i p e r ce ll DAPI H3K9me2 Nuclear periphery 0 1 2 A c t G A L4 / + s m c 5 U n c 45 M y o 1 A M y o 1 B A r p 3 S ca r w 1118 Genotype A vv e r a g e a b n o r m a li t i e s p e r ce ll WT DAPI AATAT AACAC 359 bp Arp3 RNAi * * * * * * * * * * * 3 b 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 + H3K9me3 – H3K9me3 * * * * C o n t r o l A r p 3 RNAi Control Arp3 DAPI γ H2AX PH3 DAPI - bright RNAi c IR dose ( Gy ) S u r v i v a l ( % ) Persistent foci + H3K9me2 γ H 2 A v H 3 K 9 m e 2 D AP I Control Arp2 / 3 RNAi 0 10 15 20 20 h 24 h * * * * * * * RNAi e DAPI H3K9me3 30 ′ Nuclear pore ( or INMP ) 1 .

All rights reserved . Article reSeArcH of heterochromatic DSBs along actin filaments downstream of Smc5 / 6 . This pathway appears to be conserved in mouse cells , and its deregulation results in heterochromatin repair defects and instability . These results sup - port a model in which DSBs in heterochromatin induce the formation of nuclear actin filaments that connect repair sites to the nuclear periphery . Smc5 / 6 - associated myosins travelling along these ‘highways for repair’ enable the directed movement of repair sites to the nuclear periphery for safe progression of homologous recombination repair ( Fig . 5g ) . Nuclear repositioning of repair sites has been observed in differ - ent contexts 1 , 2 , including DSBs in rDNA 28 , 29 , damaged telomeric and subtelomeric sequences 30 – 35 , collapsed replication forks 36 , 37 , persis - tent DSBs 36 , 38 – 40 , and homology search 41 , 42 . Cytoplasmic microtubules contribute to some of these dynamics via the trans - nuclear membrane LINC complex 35 , 40 . However , the nuclear structures responsible for those movements have remained largely unknown , and Brownian motions are thought to account for most of these dynamics 23 . Directed motions might be especially needed to leave the hetero - chromatin domain , given the compact nature of this domain and its potential resistance to releasing repair sites . Accordingly , Arp2 / 3 and myosins affect directed motions in heterochromatin and not in euchro - matin . Notably , Arp2 / 3 - dependent nuclear actin filaments form loose branches , distinct from the dense cytoplasmic network that mediates cell movement . This is likely to reflect specialized Arp2 / 3 regulation and F - actin remodelling 17 in the nucleus for the directed motion of repair sites . These studies identify nuclear F - actin and myosins as crit - ical components for heterochromatin repair and genome stability in multicellular eukaryotes .

Kc167 ( Kc ) cells were used for most experiments and were maintained as logarithmically growing cultures in Schneider’s medium ( Sigma ) + FBS ( Gemini ) . Kc cells were authenticated by the Drosophila Genomic Resource Center ( DGRC ) and no mycoplasma contamination was detected 43 . Stable lines were obtained by cotransfecting the plasmid of interest with pCoHygro ( Invitrogen ) or pCoPuro ( Addgene ) and selecting in the pres - ence of 100 µ g / ml hygromycin B ( Invitrogen ) or 2 mg / ml puromycin ( Enzo Life Sciences ) . Transfection was performed with DOTAP ( Roche ) or Cellfectin ( Life Technologies ) , according to the manufacturers’ protocols . Mouse NIH3T3 cells ( gift from V . Longo ) were maintained at 30 – 80 % confluency in DMEM ( Corning ) + 10 % CBS ( Denver Serum Company ) . IR treatments . Cell cultures were exposed to IR using a 160 kV X - ray source ( X - RAD iR - 160 , Precision X - Ray ) . For Drosophila cells , we mostly use a range of Gy at which the damage response increases linearly with dose ( 1 . 7 – 20 Gy ) , and corresponds to nearly sublethal doses for controls 7 . A dose of 5 Gy was used for most experiments , unless otherwise indicated . Treatments with this dose do not affect nuclear – cytoplasmic transport , which was evaluated by measuring the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic GFP - tagged Myo1A , Myo1B , MyoV , Arp2 , Arp3 and Unc45 . The estimated number of DSBs induced by 5 Gy in Drosophila cells is ~ 7 . 5 DSBs in G1 and ~ 14 DSBs in G2 7 . In kinetic analyses of fixed cells , time 0 corresponds to cells fixed without exposure to IR . In time - lapse experiments , time 0 corresponds to cells imaged 5 – 10 min before IR treatment unless otherwise specified . Mouse cells were exposed to 1 Gy , similar to previous studies 27 , 44 , 45 . Plasmids . pCopia – GFP – Mdc1 , pCopia – mCherry – HP1a , pCopia – GFP – Smc5 , pCopia – GFP – Nse2 , pCopia – GFP – Atrip , and pCopia – GFP – CenpA plasmids were previously described 5 , 7 , 46 . All other GFP - and FHA ( 3 × Flag – 3 × HA ) - tagged proteins were generated by insertion of PCR - amplified coding regions of cDNAs from DGRC or other sources . Clone numbers from DGRC were : Arp2 ( LD18955 ) , Arp3 ( LD35711 ) , Myo1A ( SD01662 ) , Myo1B ( FI19407 ) and Unc45 ( SD10334 ) . Detailed information is available on the DGRC website ( http : / / dgrc . cgb . indiana . edu ) . Arp2 / 3 has previously been identified as a major actin - nucleating factor in Drosophila 47 . Functions of Unc45 in myosin regulation have been described 48 . Wild - type actin and the two mutant constructs actin ( S14C ) and actin ( R62D ) were PCR amplified from pEF – Flag – NLS – β Actin , pEF – Flag – NLS – β Actin ( S14C ) or pEF – Flag – NLS – β Actin ( R62D ) 49 ( gift from G . Posern ) . MyoV was generated by PCR amplification of clone FI23904 ( ref . 2014422 , gift from S . Celniker ) . The actin chromobody was generated by PCR amplification of actin - chromobody – TagGFP2 – NLS plasmid 50 . MyoV headless and MyoV tail mutants were generated by PCR amplifications of truncated versions of MyoV , according to ref . 51 . All PCR products were cloned into pCopia – LAP – EGFP vectors 52 , or pCopia – 3 × Flag – StrepII – 3 × HA vectors 5 . pCopia – mCherry – Mdc1 was generated by swapping the Mdc1 gene from pCopia – GFP – Mdc1 into a pCopia – mCherry vector 5 . dsRNA synthesis and sequences . siRNAs for RNAi depletions in Drosophila cultured cells were prepared with the MEGAscript T7 Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . dsRNA derived from the brown ( bw ) gene was used as control in all exper - iments . Amplicons and RNAi conditions for bw , Smc5 , Smc6 and Rad51 were as previously described 5 . Amplicons used for all other dsRNAs were : DRSC25363 / DRSC34284 for Myo1A , DRSC27633 for Myo1B , DRSC07603 / DRSC40837 for MyoV , DRSC15449 for Unc45 , DRSC31428 / DRSC19332 for Arp2 , DRSC29666 / DRSC31430 for Arp3 , DRSC03426 / BKN22532 for Scar , DRSC37426 / DRSC06302 for Wash , DRSC26170 / DRSC15032 for Wasp , DRSC03519 / DRSC24127 for Dia , DRSC03619 / DRSC24744 / DRSC40746 for Spire , DRSC40055 for Ipo9 , DRSC17056 / DRSC32610 for Slmb and DRSC20839 / DRSC38781 for Rad21 . Sequences can be found on the DRSC website ( http : / / flyrnai . org ) . dsRNA for Whamy RNAi was prepared with the oligonucleotides : 5 ′ GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACGGAATAC GGATTATCCGCC and 5 ′ GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGATGCAG AAATCACAGCCCAA . Wash , Scar , Whamy and Wasp are the previously described Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome protein family in flies 53 . When more than one amplicon is indicated , we combined equal amounts of each dsRNA for better efficiency of protein depletion . For mouse cells , RNAi experiments were con - ducted using SMARTpool ON - TARGETplus ARP3 siRNA ( Dharmacon ) and a corresponding non - targeting RNAi control . RNAi depletion . For Drosophila cells , dsRNAs were transfected with DOTAP ( Roche ) following the manufacturer’s instructions and depletion was done for 5 days before performing experiments , except for Slmb and Rad21 RNAi , for which this was done for 4 days . We did not detect significant effects of the RNAi deple - tions shown in this paper on cell cycle progression by FACS , or on the heterochro - matin domain by live imaging of GFP – HP1a - expressing cells . Additionally , RNAi depletion of Arp2 / 3 , myosins or Unc45 did not affect nuclear pore structure by Nup62 immunofluorescence staining . Notably , studies in flies have shown that loss of Wash affects association of HP1a with heterochromatic sequences 54 . However , depletion of Wash in Kc cells did not affect the mCherry – HP1a signal , indicating that the heterochromatin domain was still largely intact in the RNAi conditions used in Fig . 1c and Extended Data Figs . 1b , l , 4f . This supports a model in which Wash works downstream of HP1a in the relocalization of heterochromatic DSBs . We also note that all kinetics resulting from RNAi depletion must be compared to cells treated with control dsRNAs , as the γ H2Av peak shifts from 10 min after IR in non - RNAi experiments ( for example , Fig . 1f ) to 30 min after IR in RNAi controls 5 ( for example , Fig . 1a ) . RNAi depletion efficiencies for Smc5 / 6 , Nse2 / Cerv , Nse2 / Qjt , dPIAS , HP1a and Rad51 have previously been validated 5 , 7 , 8 . Mouse cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 2 days before the experiments . Quantitative PCR . qPCR analysis of RNAi depletions in Drosophila cul - tured cells was performed as described 7 . Changes in transcript levels were normalized to Ebony , CG12493 or Actin5c mRNA . Primer sequences were : CGCACGGAAATTATCAAGGT and GTCTGCTCGTCATCCTCCTC for Ipo9 ; ATCATTCACTCCAATTTTACT and AGTAATCTGGTTATTAGTGGAA for Whamy , GGCTGAAGAAGAGCAACCAC and TCACCTTGCGCAACT GACCAG for Spire ; GCGAGTTGTTCCCCAAGATA and GGAGACAATCTT GCCGTCAT for Slmb . For qPCR analysis of RNAi depletions in flies , total RNA was isolated from 5 – 10 larvae by Trizol extraction and treated with DNase I to remove genomic DNA . RNA was used to generate single - stranded cDNA using oligo dT priming and Superscript Reverse Transcriptase III ( Invitrogen ) . Primer sequences were : CTTAACGAAGACCTGAATGAGGC and CGA CAGTGTCTCCTGTTCCAG for Lamin ; GAATGCCCCACATTTGTTCGC and ACCGGAAATTAGGATGCAGGT for Myo1A ; AGAGCGAAGAAGCCTT CATCG and GCTTGTAGGGATTCACGGAGAT for Myo1B . Transcripts were quantified with iQ SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio - Rad ) according to the manufac - turer’s instruction . Changes in transcript levels were normalized to Lamin mRNA . In both cultured cells and flies , each qPCR was repeated at least three times , and graphs show the average level of depletion relative to control RNAi . qPCR analysis of Arp3 RNAi depletion in mouse cells was done using two independent primer sets for both Arp3 and the control mRNA Gapdh , and the qPCR was repeated twice for each set . Averaged values were normalized for each GAPDH qPCR and averaged between each other . The primer sequences used for this analysis were : AAGAATGAAGCGGACAGGAC and AGTTGGTGATTCCTAGCGTG ( set 1 ) AATCACCAACTTCCCCATCC and AAACCTTCTCACACAGCCTC ( set 2 ) for Arp3 ; CTTTGTCAAGCTCATTTCCTGG and TCTTGCTCAGTGTCCTTGC ( set 1 ) and GCCTTCCGTGTTCCTACC and CCTCAGTGTAGCCCAAGATG ( set 2 ) for GAPDH . Immunofluorescence and quantification in fixed samples . Chromosome preparation and FISH protocols used in Fig . 5f and Extended Data Fig . 8b , i were as previously described 7 , 9 , 55 . AACAC , AATAT and 359 - bp probes were designed as previously described 55 and were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies . Probe sequences are : 5 ′ - 6 - FAM - ( AACAC ) 7 , 5 ′ - Cy3 - TTTTCCAAATTTCGGTCATCAAATAATCAT , and 5 ′ - Cy5 - ( AATAT ) 6 , respectively . Immunofluorescence without triton extraction was used for most experiments as previously described 5 . Immunofluorescence staining of myosins , Unc45 , Arp2 / 3 complex subunits , Flag – NLS – actin ( actin ( WT ) , actin ( R62D ) and actin ( S14C ) in Fig . 2d and Extended Data Fig . 4d , e ) , and F - actCB – GFP – NLS in Extended Data Fig . 3d , was preceded by a triton extraction step as previously described 7 . Notably , these Triton extraction treatments partially destabilize actin filaments 56 – 58 . Detection of nuclear actin filaments with phalloidin in Extended Data Fig . 3c was done by fixing cells for 10 min at 37 °C in pre - warmed , freshly made , fixation buffer ( 4 % PFA , 0 . 5 % Triton - X100 , 2 mM ATP , 0 . 004 % NaAz , 1 mM Na3VO4 , 1 mM NaF , 1 mM PMSF , protease inhibitor tablets ( Roche ) , phalloidin 1 : 500 ; modified from published protocols 59 , 60 ) . Imaging and image processing for fixed cells and tissues has previously been described 5 , 7 . Quantification of repair foci relative to DAPI - bright in Drosophila cells was done as previously described 5 , 7 . Quantification of repair foci relative to H3K9me2 in Drosophila cells was done as previously described 7 . Quantification of repair foci relative to DAPI - bright in mouse cells was done on volume reconstructions and only cells in G2 were used ; detection of G2 cells was based on PH3 staining as previously described 44 . For quantification of actin filaments in Extended Data Fig . 3c , filaments were detected with phalloi - din ( 1 : 500 Alexa Fluor 488 , Invitrogen , A12379 ) , imaged with 0 . 2 - µ m intervals between the z stacks , and images were deconvolved 20 times with a conservative protocol . Filaments inside the nuclei were identified using DAPI staining as a refer - ence . Figures shown are maximum intensity projections of a few z stacks across the heterochromatin domain ( s ) ( Figs . 1a , b , 5a , b ; Extended Data Fig . 1a ) , individual z stacks or maximum intensity projections of 2 – 3 z stacks ( Figs . 1f , 2d , 3d , 5f , Extended Data Figs . 1d , 2g , 3c , d , e , 4b , d , e , 6e , 8i ) , maximum intensity projections of all z stacks across the nucleus ( Fig . 5d , e , Extended Data Fig . 8b ) , or volume reconstructions ( Figs . 2a , 4d , Extended Data Figs . 2a , c , 3b , f , 4a , 5f , g , 7a ) . Western blotting . Protein extraction and western blotting to validate RNAi deple - tions were conducted as previously described 7 . © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature . All rights reserved . Article reSeArcH Immunoprecipitation . Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as pre - viously described 7 . For Myo1A immunoprecipitation , 3 × 10 8 Kc cells expressing GFP – Myo1A , or Kc cells as a control , were pelleted and snap - frozen before and 25 min after exposure to 20 Gy IR . Pellets were incubated in lysis buffer A ( 50 mM Hepes , 10 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 20 % glycerol , 1 mM PMSF , 20 mM NaF , 20 mM glycerol - 2 - phosphate , 1 mM benzamidine , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 25 mM NEM , 150 mM NaOAc , 250 mM NaCl , and protease inhibitors ( Complete , Roche ) ) , and digested with 1 µ l benzonase ( EMD Millipore ) at 4 °C for 30 min . Pellets were centrifuged and soluble lysates collected . Pellets were resuspended in buffer A and extracted with 300 mM sodium acetate for 1 h at 4 °C . Next , the supernatant was pooled with the soluble lysate . Samples were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with protein G - coupled sepharose beads and 5 µ l goat anti - GFP antibody . Beads were washed 5 times with wash buffer A ( 50 mM Hepes , 10 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 20 % glycerol , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 350 mM NaCl , 150 mM NaOAc , and 25 mM NEM ) and heated in loading buffer for 3 min at 95 °C for SDS – PAGE . For Myo1B , Arp3 and Nse2 immunoprecipitation , 3 × 10 8 Kc cells expressing GFP – Myo1B , GFP – Arp3 or FHA – Nse2 were pelleted and snap - frozen before and 25 min after exposure to 20 Gy IR . Pellets were incubated with lysis buffer C ( 50 mM Hepes / KOH pH 7 . 5 , 140 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 05 % Na - deoxycholate , 25 mM NEM ) for 30 min at 4 °C . Lysates were pelleted and the supernatant was incubated with 1 µ l of benzonase ( EMD Millipore ) for 30 min at 4 °C . Next , supernatants were incubated with Flag – M2 agarose beads ( Sigma ) for Nse2 or protein G - coupled sepharose beads and 5 µ l goat anti - GFP antibody for Myo1B for 4 h at 4 °C . Samples were washed once with lysis buffer C and four times with wash buffer B ( 100 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 250 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % Na - deoxycholate ) , before heating them in loading buffer for 3 min at 95 °C for SDS – PAGE . As a control for Myo1B immunoprecipitation , GFP – Myo1B cells were incubated with sepharose beads without antibodies . Kc cells were used as control for Nse2 and Arp3 immunoprecipitation . For MyoV immunoprecipitation , 3 × 10 8 Kc cells expressing FHA – MyoV , or cells without the FHA – MyoV plasmid as a control , were used . Cells were pelleted and snap - frozen before and 25 min after exposure to 20 Gy IR . Pellets were incu - bated in lysis buffer B ( 50 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 2 % Nonidet P - 40 , protease inhibitors ( Complete , Roche ) , 1 mM PMSF , and 25 mM NEM ) for 30 min at 4 °C . Lysates were centrifuged and the supernatant was incubated with Flag – M2 agarose beads ( Sigma ) . Samples were incubated with beads at 4 °C for 5 h . Beads were washed 5 times with lysis buffer B and heated in loading buffer for 3 min at 95 °C for SDS – PAGE . Cytoplasmic and nuclear actin fractionation . Protocols were adapted from pub - lished methods 61 . All steps were carried out in ice or in a cold room . First , 10 7 cells were collected , washed once with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and pelleted by centrifugation at 800 g for 10 min . Cell pellets were placed at − 80 °C for 1 h . Then , pellets were resuspended gently on ice in 200 µ l buffer P1 ( HEPES 10 mM , EGTA 0 . 1mM , DTT 1 mM , complete protease inhibitors ( Roche ) ) . After addition of Triton X - 100 ( final concentration 0 . 5 % ) , samples were vortexed on the highest setting for 10 s followed by centrifugation at 4 °C , 10 , 000 g for 10 min . One hundred and fifty microlitres of supernatant was collected for the cytoplasmic fraction . The remaining supernatant was removed and discarded . The cytoplas - mic fraction was centrifuged at 16 , 000 g , transferred to a new tube , and placed at − 80 °C . The nuclear pellet was gently resuspended in 1 ml buffer P1 followed by centrifugation at 4 °C , 10 , 000 g for 10 min . The supernatant of the nuclear fraction was discarded and nuclear pellet lysed in 50 µ l buffer P2 ( 20 mM HEPES , 25 % glycerol , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , complete protease inhibitors ( Roche ) ) by vortexing for 90 min at 4 °C . Nuclear extract was clarified by centrifu - gation at 20 , 000 g for 10 min . The samples were stored at − 80 °C until SDS – PAGE and western blotting were performed . Twenty - five micrograms of protein extract ( nuclear or cytoplasmic ) was loaded onto an SDS – PAGE gel , per lane . Chemical treatments . Myosin and actin polymerization inhibitors were added to the cultures before IR treatments . In Drosophila cells , treatment conditions were : 2 mM and 10 mM BDM 62 ( Sigma ) for 5 min ; 200 and 400 µ M MyoVin - 1 63 ( Calbiochem ) for 2 h ; 100 µ M and 400 µ M CK666 64 ( Sigma ) for 60 min ; 4 µ M and 8 µ M latrunculin B 65 ( Enzo Life Sciences ) for 20 min . Stocks of MyoVin - 1 ( 100 mM ) , CK666 ( 100 mg / ml ) and latrunculin B ( 10 mM ) were prepared in DMSO and those of BDM were diluted in water . For mouse cells , treatment condi - tions were : 7 . 5 mM BDM for 20 min ; 200 µ M MyoVin - 1 for 60 min ; 400 µ M CK666 for 60 min ; 8 µ M latrunculin B for 20 min . All stocks were prepared in DMSO . For controls , DMSO or water was added to the medium to yield final concentrations equivalent to samples treated with chemicals . For the ‘release’ time points shown in Extended Data Figs . 1f , g , 6h , Kc cells were washed 3 times after incubation with each chemical , and incubated at 27 °C for 1 h before IR . Cells were fixed 60 min after IR . Notably , the doses of LatB treatments used affect nuclear actin polymer - ization in addition to cytoplasmic actin 65 . Cell imaging and processing in time - lapse experiments . For MSD analyses , cells stably expressing GFP – Mdc1 and mCherry – HP1a were imaged before and after IR as described 24 . In brief , imaging after IR was done every 40 s for 60 min starting from 3 – 5 min after IR 7 , 24 . Ten z stacks at 0 . 8 µ m distance were imaged for 0 . 005 ms for GFP , and 0 . 015 ms for mCherry . The Coolsnap HQ2 camera was set at 2 × 2 binning to maximize the light collected while minimizing light exposure and cell phototoxicity . Accordingly , these imaging conditions did not induce DSB forma - tion or affect cell division ( Extended Data Fig . 7a ) . All videos were corrected to compensate for modest photobleaching effects using softWoRx ( Applied Precision / GE Healthcare ) . For each nucleus , 6 – 12 of the most stationary and spatially distant foci were tracked with Imaris ( Bitplane ) and used as a reference for registering the nucleus as previously described 24 . Foci were tracked in 3D using a semi - automated method and manually corrected to ensure optimal connections between time points 24 . For live imaging experiments , IR dose was lowered from 5 Gy to 1 . 7 Gy to reduce the average number of Mdc1 foci per nucleus and the frequencies of ambiguous tracks . Focus positional data were extracted in Excel and analysed in Matlab ( MathWorks ) using a customized script 24 . MSDs were calculated as previ - ously described 24 . Positional data were also analysed using a customized script in R Studio to detect LDMs 24 . In brief , the script derives MSD curves for time intervals ∆ t > 10 and increasing starting time points for each trajectory , and identifies time intervals characterized by MSD graphs with increasing slopes 22 , 59 . LDMs shown in Fig . 4c and Extended Data Fig . 7d correspond to the largest contiguous time interval containing MSDs of increasing slope for each focus . The ability of the script to correctly detect directed motions was confirmed by inde - pendent MSD analysis of the positional data within the time intervals of the LDMs , as shown in Extended Data Fig . 7e . For live imaging of nuclear actin filaments , a stable cell line expressing F - actCB – GFP – NLS was exposed to 5 Gy IR . The same field of cells was imaged before and every 5 min after IR for 60 min . Ten z stacks at 0 . 8 µ m distance were imaged , starting 3 – 12 min after IR . 3D volume recon - structions and movie generation were done in Imaris ( Bitplane ) . Quantification of filament length and angles of actin branches was done using the Measurement Tool in Imaris . IR sensitivity assay . The IR sensitivity assay for RNAi depletion experiments ( Fig . 5c , left ) was done as previously described 7 . Quantification of IR sensitivity for cells expressing actin ( WT ) or actin ( R62D ) ( Fig . 5c , right ) was done using a trypan blue exclusion test for cell viability 66 . Micronucleus assays . The micronucleus assay in Kc cells was done as previously described 7 . Micronuclei in NIH3T3 cells were quantified in cells fixed 72 h after IR based on DAPI and H3K9me3 staining . Antibodies .

Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were from Life Technologies and Jackson Immunoresearch . Those used for western blotting were from Pierce and Santa Cruz Biotech . Antibodies were previously validated 5 , 7 , 44 or validated by comparing western blot or immunofluorescence signals in the presence of the protein of interest with signals after RNAi depletions , or immuno - fluorescence signals in the absence of primary antibodies . Fly stocks and crosses . Drosophila were maintained on standard medium at 25 °C , which was prepared as previously described 71 .

This form is intended for publication with all accepted life science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting . Every life science submission will use this form ; some list items might not apply to an individual manuscript , but all fields must be completed for clarity . For further information on the points included in this form , see Reporting Life Sciences Research . For further information on Nature Research policies , including our data availability policy , see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist . (cid:96) Experimental design 1 . Sample size Describe how sample size was determined . We performed initial experiments to evaluate the variance of the population , and chose the sample size so that we have a 80 % power of detecting a mean difference of 20 % from the controls , with a significance level of 5 % ( two sided ) . GraphPad StatMate software was used for these estimates . 2 . Data exclusions Describe any data exclusions . No samples were excluded . Within each fixed sample , dead cells and mitotic cells ( identified by DAPI staining ) were excluded . Cells that display excessive rotational / translational motions that could not be corrected for with our registration method , were excluded from the analysis of focus dynamics in movies . 3 . Replication Describe whether the experimental findings were reliably reproduced . All the described findings were reliably reproduced . 4 . Randomization Describe how samples / organisms / participants were allocated into experimental groups . The cells quantified in each experiment were randomly sampled from the total population of cells . 5 . Blinding Describe whether the investigators were blinded to group allocation during data collection and / or analysis . We assured reliable and unbiased data quantification by having different investigators quantify each experiment independently . Analyses were done on randomized samples . No animals or human research participants were involved . Other levels of blinding are not relevant to this study . Note : all studies involving animals and / or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used . 2 n a t u r e r e s e a r c h | l i f e s c i e n c e s r e p o r t i n g s u mm a r y J u n e 2017 6 .
