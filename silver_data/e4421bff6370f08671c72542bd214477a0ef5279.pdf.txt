Indeed , a var - iety of fucosylated oligosaccharides , speciﬁc to human milk , form part of the innate immune system . In the present study , we demon - strate the speciﬁc blocking of PA - IIL , a fucose - binding lectin of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , by milk oligosac - charides . Two fucosylated epitopes , Lewis a and 3 - fucosyl - lactose ( Lewis x glucose analogue ) bind to the lectin with dissociation constants of 2 . 2 × 10 − 7 M and 3 . 6 × 10 − 7 M respectively . Ther - modynamic studies indicate that these interactions are dominated by enthalpy . The entropy contribution is slightly favourable when binding to fucose and to the highest - afﬁnity ligand , Lewis a . The high - resolution X - ray structures of two complexes of PA - IIL with milk oligosaccharides allow the precise determination of the con - formation of a trisaccharide and a pentasaccharide . The different types of interaction between the oligosaccharides and the protein involve not only hydrogen bonding , but also calcium - and water - bridged contacts , allowing a rationalization of the thermodynamic data . This study provides important structural information about compounds that could be of general application in new therapeutic strategies against bacterial infections . Key words : crystal structure , fucose , human milk oligosaccharide , lectin , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , thermodynamics . INTRODUCTION Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that infects immunosuppressed individuals and compromised tissues , such as burn wounds or the trachea of intubated patients . The bacteria en - danger especially patients with cystic ﬁbrosis . For pathogenic or - ganisms , the ability to adhere to host tissues is essential to initiate an infection , and host cell surface glyconjugates represent a spe - ciﬁc target for bacterial receptors [ 1 ] . P . aeruginosa produces a variety of carbohydrate - binding proteins that could be involved in host recognition and adhesion . Some of them are located at the tip of pili [ 2 ] and ﬂagella [ 3 ] , whereas others are soluble lectins present in the cytoplasm and at the surface of the bacteria [ 4 ] . The role of carbohydrate – lectin adhesion in several bacterial infections of the stomach , ears and bladder has been recognized , and oligosaccharide - based treatments have been tried [ 5 , 6 ] . In the intestine of the human newborn , maternal milk oligosaccharides offer natural protection against pathogen infection [ 7 ] . Human milkcontainsasigniﬁcantamountofstructurallydiverseoligosac - charides , most of which are fucosylated neutral oligosaccharides carrying lactose at their reducing end [ 8 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Since human milk oligosaccharides are soluble analogues of epithelial cell sur - face glycoconjugates , they competitively inhibit the binding of pathogenic bacteria and viruses to epithelial ligands [ 9 ] . More particularly , fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides inhibit binding in vitro or in vivo of several pathogens , such as entero - pathic Escherichiacoli [ 10 ] , Campylobacterjejuni [ 11 ] , Norwald - likevirus [ 12 ] and Helicobacterpylori [ 13 ] . P . aeruginosa canalso colonize the gastrointestinal tract and cause paediatric diarrhoea . Moreover , undetected endogenous gastrointestinal carriage can lead to severe infection in other parts of the body [ 14 , 15 ] . A fucose - binding lectin , PA - IIL , has been isolated from the P . aeruginosa cytoplasm [ 4 ] and its amino acid sequence charac - terized [ 16 ] . This soluble lectin is also present at the surface of the bacterial cell [ 17 ] , is regulated by quorum sensing and is as - sociated with virulence factors [ 18 ] . It has been demonstrated recently that human milk , but not cow’s milk , speciﬁcally blocks haemagglutination by PA - IIL [ 19 ] . In the last 2 years , our group has deciphered the structural basis of the interaction between PA - IIL and fucose [ 20 , 21 ] . Fucose binding is mediated by two cal - cium ions , and this very unusual binding mode is responsible for the afﬁnity ( K a 0 . 18 × 10 6 M − 1 ) , which is much higher than is classically observed in protein – carbohydrate interactions [ 22 ] . Characterization of the interaction between PA - IIL and human milk oligosaccharides may help in understanding the role of PA - IIL in bacterial infection . Furthermore , detailed description of the structural and thermodynamic interactions will help in the design of carbohydrate - based compounds that can be used against P . aeruginosa infections such as those that threaten the lives of cystic ﬁbrosis patients . We present here a study of the ﬁne speci - ﬁcity of PA - IIL towards a number of human milk oligosac - charides , and characterization of the thermodynamics of binding Abbreviations used : ELLA , enzyme - linked lectin assay ; FucLac , fucosyl - lactose ; ITC , isothermal titration microcalorimetry ; Le a , Lewis a ; Le x , Lewis x ; Le x g . a . , Le x glucose analogue ; LNFP - II , lacto - N - fucopentaose - II ; LNnDFH - II , lacto - N - neodifucohexaose - II ; LNnFP - V , lacto - N - neofucopentaose - V ; Me - α Fuc , methyl - α - L - fucopyranoside ; SiaLe a , sialyl Lewis a ; SiaLe x , sialyl Lewis x ; T - PBS , PBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween . 1 These authors contributed equally to this work . 2 To whom correspondence should be addressed ( email imberty @ cermav . cnrs . fr ) . c (cid:2) 2005 Biochemical Society 326 S .

The crystal structures of PA - IIL in complex with fucosylated tri - and penta - saccharide have been solved to a resolution of 1 . 75 and 1 . 05 Å respectively ( where 1 Å = 0 . 1 nm ) , yielding the ﬁrst atomic - resolution structures of human milk oligosaccharides and their interaction with bacterial receptors . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Recombinant PA - IIL was puriﬁed from Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) containing the plasmid pET25pa2l as described previously [ 21 ] . L - Fuc and 2 (cid:3) - FucLac ( 2 (cid:3) - fucosyl - lactose ) were purchased from Sigma ; Me - α Fuc ( methyl - α - L - fucopyranoside ) was purchased from Interchim ; LNFP - II ( lacto - N - fucopentaose II ) , Le x ( Lewis x ) , Le a ( Lewis a ) , SiaLe a ( sialyl Lewis a ) and SiaLe x ( sialyl Lewis x ) were purchased from Dextra . 3 - FucLac , LNnFP - V ( lacto - N - neofucopentaose - V ) and LNnDFH - II ( lacto - N - neodifucohexaose - II ) were produced in engineered E . coli strains and puriﬁed as described previously [ 23 ] . ELLA ( enzyme - linked lectin assay ) experiments ELLAs were conducted usin g 96 - well microtitre plates ( Nunc Maxisorb ) coated with PA - IIL ( 5 µ g / ml ) diluted in carbonate buffer , pH 9 . 6 ( 100 µ l ) for 1 h at 37 ◦ C . After blocking at 37 ◦ C for 1 h with 100 µ l per well of 3 % ( w / v ) BSA in PBS , plates were incubated at 37 ◦ C for 1 h with 100 µ l of biotinylated polymeric fucose ( Lectinity Holding , Inc . ) at 5 µ g / ml in the presence of serial dilutions of inhibitors . After washing with T - PBS ( PBS con - taining 0 . 05 % Tween ) , 100 µ l of streptavidin – peroxidase conju - gate ( dilution 1 : 5000 ; Boehringer - Mannheim ) was added and left for 1 h at 37 ◦ C . The colour was developed using 100 µ l per well of 0 . 05 M phosphate / citrate buffer containing O - phenylene - diamine dihydrochloride ( 0 . 4 mg / ml ) and urea hydrogen peroxide ( 0 . 4 mg / ml ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 µ l of 30 % H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance was read at 490 nm using a microtitre plate reader ( Bio - Rad ; model 680 ) . ITC ( isothermal titration microcalorimetry ) analysis ITC experiments were performed with a VP - ITC isothermal titration calorimeter ( Microcal ) . The experiments were carried out at 25 ◦ C . Sugars and proteins were dissolved in the same buffer , i . e . 0 . 1 M Tris with 0 . 03 mM CaCl 2 at pH 7 . 5 . The protein concen - tration in the microcalorimeter cell ( 1 . 4 ml ) varied from 23 . 5 to 50 µ M . A total of 22 injections of 13 µ l of sugar solution at con - centrations varying from 0 . 24 to 0 . 5 mM were added at intervals of 5 min while stirring at 310 rev . / min . Control experiments per - formed by injection of buffer into the protein solution yielded insigniﬁcant heats of dilution . The experimental data were ﬁtted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal , with (cid:2) H ( enthalpy change ) , K a ( association constant ) and n ( number of binding sites per monomer ) as adjustable parameters , from the relationship : Q i = nP t (cid:2) HV o 2 (cid:1) 1 + A t nP t + 1 nK P t − (cid:2)(cid:3) 1 + A t nP t + 1 nK P t (cid:4) 2 − 4 A t nP t (cid:5) where P t is the total protein concentration , A t is the total con - centration of the ligand , V o is the volume of the cell and Q i is the total heat released for injection i . (cid:2) G values and entropy contri - butions were determined from the standard equation : (cid:2) G = − RT ln K = (cid:2) H − T (cid:2) S where (cid:2) G , (cid:2) H and (cid:2) S are the changes in free energy , enthalpy and entropy respectively of binding , T is the absolute temperature , R = 8 . 32 J · mol − 1 · K − 1 and K is the association constant . All ex - periments were performed with c values 100 < c < 200 ( c = K a M , where M is the initial concentration of the macromolecule ) . Crystallization Crystallization conditions were screened using the hanging - drop vapour diffusion method from complete Hampton Screens I and II ( Hampton Research ) and the best conditions were selected . For the PA - IIL – LNnFP - V complex , hanging drops were prepared using 2 . 5 µ l of lyophilized puriﬁed PA - IIL dissolved in water ( 10 mg · ml − 1 ) in the presence of LNnFP - V ( 1300 µ g · ml − 1 ) and c (cid:2) 2005 Biochemical Society Interaction of human milk oligosaccharides with bacterial lectin 327 CaCl 2 salt ( 2 mM ) and 2 . 5 µ l of reservoir solution ( 1 . 75 M am - monium sulphate in 0 . 1 M Tris / HCl , pH 8 . 5 ) . Crystals , obtained within 3 weeks at 20 ◦ C , belong to space group P1 ( a = 47 . 01 Å , b = 48 . 35 Å , c = 52 . 47 Å , α = 85 . 35 ◦ , β = 80 . 05 ◦ and γ = 65 . 60 ◦ ) , with four molecules per asymmetric unit , corresponding to a V m ( Matthews coefﬁcient ) of 2 . 3 Å 3 · Da − 1 and a solvent content of 46 % . For the PA - IIL – Le a complex , lyophilized protein was dissolved in water ( 10 mg · ml − 1 ) in the presence of Le a ( 806 µ g · ml − 1 ) and CaCl 2 salt ( 2 mM ) . Crystalline plates were obtained from hanging drops of 2 . 5 µ l of protein solution mixed with 2 . 5 µ l of reservoir solution { 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6 . 5 , 30 % PEG [ poly ( ethylene glycol ) ] 8000 and 0 . 2 M ammonium sulphate } . The crystal plates belong to space group P2 1 ( a = 51 . 57 Å , b = 75 . 82 Å , c = 52 . 74 Å and β = 93 . 48 ◦ ) , with four molecules per asymmetric unit , resulting in a V m of 2 . 2 Å 3 · Da − 1 and a solvent content of 44 % . Data collection and structure solution Crystals were cryo - cooled at 100 K after soaking them for as short atimeaspossiblein25 % ( v / v ) glycerolintheprecipitantsolution . All data images were recorded on an ADSC Q4R CCD detector ( Quantum Corp . ) at a wavelength of 0 . 934 Å on beamline ID14 - 1 at ESRF ( Grenoble , France ) . Data were processed with MOSFLM [ 24 ] , and scaled and converted to structure factors using the CCP4 programme suite [ 25 ] . In the particular case of the 1 . 05 Å PA - IIL – LNnFP - V complex , to avoid the loss of the strongest reﬂections owing to saturation , three sets of data ( one low - and two high - resolution passes ) were collected from the same crystal . Phasing of the PA - IIL – LNnFP - V complex was performed with ACORN [ 26 ] , using only the positions of three of the calcium ions from the crystal structure of the PA - IIL – fucose complex sol - ved previously at 1 . 0 Å resolution [ 21 ] . Using the ACORN phases , an initial structure was built automatically using ARP / warp [ 27 ] . The resulting electron density maps showed clear features corres - ponding to the oligosaccharide ligands . Cycles of iterative manual rebuilding and reﬁnement were performed using the programs O [ 28 ] and REFMAC [ 29 ] . In the binding sites of monomers A and C , only four and three sugar residues respectively could be positioned in the electron density maps , whereas a pentasaccha - ride could be positioned in monomers B and D . The structure of the Le a - complexed lectin was solved by the molecular replacement technique with the MOLREP program [ 25 ] , using the monomeric structure of the PA - IIL – fucose com - plex ( PDB code 1GZT ) stripped of water molecules and calcium ions as the search probe . Four clear solutions were found , corres - ponding to a tetramer in the asymmetric cell described previously [ 20 ] . The initial F o – F c difference maps showed clearly the pre - senceoffourLe a ligands , oneforeachmonomer . Cyclesofmanual model rebuilding with O and reﬁnement with REFMAC gave the ﬁnal structure . Co - ordinates of the ﬁnal structures ( see reﬁnement statistics in Table 1 ) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under codes 1W8F and 1W8H for the LNnFP - V - and Le a - complexed structures respectively . RESULTS Speciﬁcity of the interaction between PA - IIL and human milk oligosaccharides Since haemagglutination by PA - IIL has been demonstrated to be blocked speciﬁcally by human milk [ 19 ] , we studied the afﬁnity of different human milk oligosaccharides towards the lectin using ELLAs .

These oligosaccharides are representative of the variety of fuco - sylated epitopes found in human milk oligosaccharides : α Fuc1 - 2Gal , α Fuc1 - 4GlcNAc , α Fuc1 - 3GlcNac and α Fuc1 - 3Glc . IC 50 values ranged from 23 µ M for 2 (cid:3) - FucLac to 0 . 5 µ M for the best inhibitor , Le a . After normalizing values to that of fucose , the inhi - bitory potency of the oligosaccharides appears to be directly dependent on the linkage between the fucose moiety and the carryingoligosaccharides ( Figure2 ) . Oligosaccharidescontaining a fucose residue linked to position 2 of galactose ( 2 (cid:3) - FucLac ) are poor inhibitors . Similarly , the Le x series , which contain a fucose on position 3 of a GlcNAc residue , bind less efﬁciently to PA - IIL than does fucose alone . On the other hand , the Le x g . a . ( Le x glu - cose analogue ) series , in which the GlcNAc is replaced by Glc , binds approx . 6 - fold better than fucose . The best inhibitors belong to the Le a series , which contain fucose linked on position 4 of a GlcNAc residue ; these are 8 – 10 times stronger inhibitors than fucose . These data demonstrate that the presence of a sialyl group does not improve the inhibitory potency of the Le a and Le x c (cid:2) 2005 Biochemical Society 328 S . Perret and others Figure 3 ITC analysis of the interaction of PA - IIL with Le a Curves are shown for Le a ( 0 . 324mM ) binding to PA - IIL ( 32 . 7 µ M ) in 100mM Tris buffer containing0 . 03mMCaCl 2 , pH7 . 5 , at25 ◦ C .

Moreover , the length of the oligosaccharides containing the Le x g . a . or Le a epitope does not modify the strength of the interaction . This indicates that only the Lewis epitope part of the oligosaccharide is responsible for the high - afﬁnity binding to the lectin . Together , these data conﬁrm and complete those obtained previously using different binding assays [ 20 ] . Thermodynamics of the interactions between PA - IIL and human milk oligosaccharides In order to characterize further the interactions of the lectin with some of the most potent competitors , K a values and thermody - namic binding parameters were analysed using ITC . A typical titration curve for the Le a trisaccharide , the most potent ligand of PA - IIL found in the ELLA experiments described above , is shown in Figure 3 . The association constant of PA - IIL – Le a binding was 4 . 7 × 10 6 M − 1 , some 14 times stronger than for binding of L - fucose ( Table 2 ) . The Le x g . a . from human milk and the Le x g . a . - containing oligosaccharides LNFP - V and LNFP - II presented K a values 5 – 8 times higher than that for L - fucose . On the other hand , the afﬁnity of the lectin for the Le x trisaccharide was slightly lower than for fucose . These values are in agreement with the relative inhibitory potencies calculated from the ELLA experiments ( Fig - ure 2 ) . The afﬁnity constants described here for PA - IIL are much higher than those usually observed for lectin – oligosaccharide interactions [ 22 ] . Analyses of the different thermodynamic contributions to li - gand binding indicate that the interaction is unambiguously enthalpy - driven . In all cases except one , the entropy term is small , with the T (cid:2) S value close to 10 % of the free - energy term − (cid:2) G ( Table 2 ) . The strong enthalpy term is not surprising , since the characteristics of fucose binding to the primary binding site are dominated by hydrogen bonding and a very unusual co - ordination to two calcium ions [ 20 , 21 ] . Interestingly , there is no or almost no entropy barrier for the binding of mono - or oligo - saccharides to PA - IIL . Two ligands , L - fucose and Le a trisaccharide , present a slightly favourable entropy term , and for one ligand , Le x , the entropycontributesalmostone - third ( 28 % ) ofthebindingfreeen - ergy . This is unusual in protein – carbohydrate interactions , where several factors , usually attributed to ﬂexibility of the ligand and displacement of water molecules from amphiphilic surfaces [ 30 ] , generally yield an unfavourable entropy term [ 22 ] . The oligo - saccharides of the Lewis series are uncommonly rigid , due to their branched structure [ 31 , 32 ] , and this could explain the atyp - ical favourable entropy contribution . Interestingly 3 - FucLac , the glucose analogue of Le x , binds with unfavourable entropy , which is perhaps due to a decrease in the rigidity of the trisaccharide with the absence of the N - acetyl group at position 2 ( Figure 1 ) . Crystal structures of complexes of PA - IIL with two human milk oligosaccharides The crystal structures of the PA - IIL – Le a and PA - IIL – LNnFP - V complexes contain the same overall features as the PA - IIL – Fuc complex crystallized in the P 2 1 space group and previously reﬁned to 1 . 0 Å resolution [ 21 ] , and in space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 at 1 . 2 Å resolution [ 17 ] , showing a conserved quaternary arrange - ment , as well as the calcium - and fucose - binding modes ( Fig - ures 4A and 4B ) .

There are few structural data on fucose - binding lectins at the present time ; complexes of fucose with Ulex europaeus lectin I [ 33 ] , eel lectin [ 34 ] , fungal Aleuria aurantia lectin [ 35 ] and mutated mannan - binding protein - A [ 36 ] interestingly display completely different structural features , and no comparisons can be made . Ofspecialinterestistheanalysisoftheconformationsofthetwo oligosaccharides that are reported here for the ﬁrst time in the crystalline state , together with their interactions with the protein receptor . There are no signiﬁcant differences among the four monomers of PA - IIL – Le a present in the asymmetric unit . Analysis of the mode of binding of Le a by PA - IIL reveals a large num - ber of contacts between the sugar and the protein ( Figure 4C ) . All three of the monosaccharides interact with the protein surface either directly ( hydrogen bonding and co - ordination of calcium ) or indirectly through bridging water molecules ( Table 3 ) . In addition to the nine direct hydrogen bonds between the fucose and the protein described previously , the GlcNAc residue establishes a hydrogen bond between its O - 6 atom and the main - chain carbonyl group of Asp - 96 . Two water molecules play an important bridging role in the interaction : one bridges O - 1 and O - 2 of fucose to the amide nitrogen of Thr - 98 , whereas the other bridges the Gal residue ( O - 2 and O - 1 ) to the side chain of Ser - 23 . Hydrophobic contacts are very limited and only involve the methyl group of fucose with that of Thr - 145 . Due to its branched structure , Le a has been described as a rigid trisaccharide in NMR and modelling studies [ 31 , 32 ] . Indeed , our results show that the conformation adopted by Le a in the binding site is similar to that predicted by c (cid:2) 2005 Biochemical Society 330 S .

Torsion angles of interest are listed in Table 4 . Among the four independent molecules of the PA - IIL – LNnFP - V complex , clear electron density can be observed for two com - plete pentasaccharides ( Figure 5 ) , whereas only a tetrasaccharide and a trisaccharide can be located for the two remaining sites . The fact that two of the oligosaccharides can be completely visual - ized is due the rigidity of their linear part resulting from fortuitous crystal packing that generates extensive contacts between two adjacent sugars centred around a pseudo two - fold axis of sym - metry ( Figure 4E ) . It is this interaction that allows the very - high - resolution structure of milk pentasaccharide to be described here for the ﬁrst time . The protein - binding site , together with the calcium ions and fucose moiety , are identical with those described previously . Additional interactions with the protein surface are Figure 5 Initial sigma - weighted F o – F c electron density map ( A ) The map has been contoured at 1 σ around the trisaccharide in the PA - IIL – Le a complex calculated after molecular replacement and ﬁrst cycle of reﬁnement without ligand and water .

The ﬁnal positions of the oligosaccharide and calcium in the model have been superimposed as thin lines for comparison . established by the glucose and galactose residues of the Le x g . a . moiety ( Figure 4D and Table 3 ) . The glucose establishes a direct hydrogen bond between its hydroxy group at position 2 and the side chain of Asp - 96 . In addition , ﬁve interactions are mediated by a water molecule , involving O - 1 of fucose , O - 1 and O - 6 of glucose , and O - 1 , O - 2 and O - 6 of galactose . Hydrophobic interactions are observed for the methyl group of fucose , but also for C - 6 of galactose , which interacts with the carbon of a glycerol molecule located at the protein surface . The other part of the pentasaccharide , i . e . the β Glc1 - 4 β GlcNAc linked to posi - tion 3 of galactose , does not interact with the protein surface , but instead is involved in extensive interactions with the neighbouring carbohydrate in the crystal lattice ( Figure 4E ) . The conformations of the pentasaccharide correspond to a low - energy minimum of each glycosidic linkage , as established previously by conformational analysis studies [ 32 ] . The 3 - FucLac moiety ( Le x g . a . ) is the most rigid part , and it adopts a conform - ation with glycosidic linkage orientations similar to those ob - served in the crystal structure of hydrated Le x [ 37 ] ( Table 5 ) . DISCUSSION The binding of carbohydrate ligands to the fucose - binding lectin of P . aeruginosa presents some particular features that are not commonly observed in protein – carbohydrate interactions .

A special feature is the favourable , albeit very weak , entropy that has been observed for fucose bin - ding that could be generated by the release of three tightly bound water molecules ( observed in the crystal structure of the unliganded lectin [ 17 ] ) that are replaced by fucose hydroxy groups in the complex . Whenlookingatoligosaccharidebinding , andmoreparticularly at human milk oligosaccharides that can play a role in early - stage colonization , the speciﬁcity of PA - IIL is limited to those oligosaccharides with fucose linked to position 4 of GlcNAc , and not to position 3 . This is rationalized by the two high - resol - ution crystal structures presented here . In Le a , the Fuc1 - 4GlcNAc linkage positions O - 6 of GlcNAc in a favourable location to create an additional hydrogen bond with the protein backbone ( Fig - ure 4C ) . For the Le x trisaccharide , the Fuc1 - 3GlcNAc linkage would locate the N - acetyl group to the same position , therefore creating steric conﬂicts ; this will result in a deformation of the trisaccharide , weaker binding and , more particularly , as observed in ITC , a large decrease in the enthalpy term . In Le x g . a . , the N - acetyl group at position 2 is replaced by a hydroxy group that makes a hydrogen bond to the protein ( Figure 4D ) . Superim - position of the two binding sites ( Figure 4F ) shows that Le x g . a . adopts a slightly different orientation than Le a in the binding site . The speciﬁcity range established by ELLA experiments gives same order of ligand afﬁnity as the titration study in solution , demonstrating that the lectin is fully active when ﬁxed on the surface . The microcalorimetry study conﬁrmed that the highest - afﬁnity ligand was the Le a trisaccharide , and that it binds with very high enthalpy contribution ( (cid:2) H = − 35 kJ / mol ) and slightly favourable entropy ( − T (cid:2) S = − 3 kJ / mol ) . Interestingly , the Le x g . a . presents an unfavourable entropy contribution . This could be due either to the absence of the N - acetyl group that brings higher ﬂexibility to the adjacent linkage , or to the fact that the binding involves three more bridging water molecules , immobilization of which generates an entropy penalty . The large variety of fucosylated oligosaccharides that are pre - sent in human milk ( > 100 ) may represent an adapted and speciﬁc response to block a large number of pathogens . For example , C . jejuni is speciﬁcally blocked by H ( O ) antigen ( α Fuc1 - 2 β Gal1 - 4GlcNAc ) [ 11 ] whereas H . pylori is blocked by Lewis b epitope ( α Fuc1 - 2 β Gal1 – 3 [ α Fuc1 - 4 ] GlcNAc ) [ 13 ] . The presence of the three different fucosyl epitopes in milk , i . e . α Fuc1 - 2 β Gal , α Fuc1 - 3Glc / GlcNAc and α Fuc1 - 4GlcNAc , is genetically determined primarily by the action of a Lewis gene coding for an α 1 , 3 / 4 - fucosyltransferase and a secretor gene coding for α 1 , 2 - fuco - syltransferase [ 38 ] . In the European population , as a consequence of polymorphisms yielding inactive or partially active enzymes , approx . 70 % of women will have α 1 , 2 - , α 1 , 3 - and α 1 , 4 - linked fucosyl residues in their milk . Fucosyl residues linked α 1 , 2 and α 1 , 4 will be absent from 20 % and 10 % of the population res - pectively . A clear relationship has been established between maternal genotype and the risk of diarrhoea in their infants [ 39 ] . The P . aeruginosa lectin is blocked by α 1 , 4GlcNAc - but also by α 1 , 3Glc - linked fucosyl residues that are present in the milk of all women . It is therefore most interesting that these two epitopes are the ones that present the highest afﬁnity found to date for the soluble lectin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
