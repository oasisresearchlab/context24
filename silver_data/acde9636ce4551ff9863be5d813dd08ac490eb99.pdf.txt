The Polyelectrolyte Nature of F - actin and the Mechanism of Actin Bundle Formation * ( Received for publication , November 10 , 1995 ) Jay X . Tang and Paul A . Janmey From the Division of Experimental Medicine , Brigham and Women’s Hospital , LMRC 301 , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 Polymerized ( F - ) actin is induced to form bundles by a number of polycations including divalent metal ions , Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) , and basic polypeptides . The general features of bundle formation are largely independent of the spe - cific structure of the bundling agent used . A threshold concentration of polycation is required to form lateral aggregates of actin filaments . The threshold concentra - tion varies strongly with the valence of the cation and increases with the ionic strength of the solution . Poly - anions such as nucleoside phosphates or oligomers of acidic amino acids disaggregate actin bundles into sin - gle filaments . These features are similar to the phenom - enon of DNA condensation and can be explained analo - gously by polyelectrolyte theories . Similar results were found when F - actin was bundled by the peptide corre - sponding to the actin binding site of myristoylated ala - nine - rich protein kinase C substrate protein ( MARCKS ) or by smooth muscle calponin , suggesting that a broad class of actin bundling factors may function in a com - mon manner . Physiologic concentrations of both small ions and large proteins can induce actin interfilament association independent of a requirement for specific binding sites . Actin polymerizes to double stranded filamentous form ( F - actin ) in solutions of physiological ionic strength ( 2 m M MgCl 2 and 100 m M KCl ) . At relatively high ( (cid:46) 10 m M ) concentrations of divalent cations such as Mg 2 (cid:49) , F - actin forms aggregates of various forms , characterized as types I , II , and III paracrystals ( 1 ) . Stable Type III paracrystals appear as large and compact side - by - side aggregates , with additional morphological varia - tions identified by analyzing electron micrographs ( EM ) ( 2 – 6 ) . An EM specimen typically manifests several morphologies , for which no difference in experimental conditions can be assigned . The co - existence of these morphological states implies that the total free energies of the various bundle forms are similar , provided that an overall attractive interaction exists in order to bring the filaments together . Chemicals that cause F - actin to form paracrystalline bun - dles , such as divalent cations at high concentrations ( order of 10 m M ) ( 4 ) , trivalent cations ( m M range ) ( 7 ) , and polyamines ( 3 , 4 ) are similar to those which cause DNA condensation ( 8 , 9 ) , except that the latter effect requires consistently higher con - centrations of polycations . Both effects also occur at low pH ( (cid:44) 5 . 5 ) , and at high osmotic pressure ( by addition of polyethyl - ene glycol , for example ) ( 10 ) . It is the goal of this paper to demonstrate that the mechanism of F - actin bundle formation is analogous to that established for DNA condensation . The phenomenon of DNA condensation has been successfully treated by the theory of linear polyelectrolytes ( 11 – 14 ) . A dou - ble stranded DNA at neutral pH has a linear charge spacing b (cid:53) 1 . 7 Å , much less than the Bjerrum length , the distance between elementary charges at which the electrostatic interac - tion energy equals the thermal energy kT , i . e . (cid:108) B (cid:53) e 2 / 4 (cid:112)(cid:101) 0 (cid:101) kT . In water , for example , the dielectric constant (cid:101) (cid:53) 80 at 20 °C and (cid:108) B (cid:53) 7 . 1 Å . According to the Manning counterion conden - sation theory ( 12 ) , a consequence of DNA’s high charge density is that a certain fraction of its charge is neutralized due to the territorial binding of counterions in the immediate environ - ment ( so - called condensed counterions which are free to diffuse along the polymer axis , but inhibited from diffusing away ) . The fraction of polyelectrolyte charge compensated by the con - densed counterions is determined as the following equation , (cid:117)(cid:53) (cid:83) 1 (cid:50) 1 N (cid:122) (cid:68) ( Eq . 1 ) where N is the valence of the counterion and (cid:122) (cid:53) (cid:108) B / b (cid:53) 4 . 2 . In monovalent electrolytes , (cid:117) is calculated to be 76 % . It may reach 88 % in the presence of sufficient divalent cations . Hence the predicted delocalized binding is stronger for counterions of higher valence , in which case the charged polymer is neutral - ized to a higher degree . The residual electrostatic repulsion between polyelectrolytes of like charge tends to keep them apart . This repulsive force decreases with the presence of polyvalent counterions , due to the enhanced charge condensation . In addition to the weak - ened electrostatic repulsion between charged polymers due to counterions , an attractive interaction can also be induced by two polymers sharing counterions . The fluctuation ( 15 ) and lateral redistribution ( 14 ) of counterions have each been shown theoretically to cause an attractive interaction between poly - electrolytes . At appropriate ionic conditions , a balance between attractive and repulsive forces occurs so that the filaments in suspension form aggregates . This aggregation may also involve other interactions such as hydration and van der Waals forces ( 11 , 13 ) . It has been estimated that DNA condensation occurs as (cid:117) reaches 90 % , which requires a valence of 3 or higher . Counterion condensation theory has been applied to other polyelectrolytes such as polystyrene sulfonate and heparinate ( 16 , 17 ) . Justification for applying this theory has come from several different treatments . For example , analytical solutions to the nonlinear Poisson - Boltzmann equation for a cylindrical polyelectrolyte ( 18 , 19 ) provide a model generally consistent with that of the earlier counterion condensation theory . Similar predictions were also obtained by Monte Carlo simulations ( 20 , 21 ) . Alternatively , an interesting ligand binding model of coun - terion condensation was proposed ( 22 ) , with an assumption analogous to the territorial binding in the Manning theory . In this paper , the simplified predictions from the original Man - ning theory are used to explain the phenomenon of bundle formation by F - actin .

An actin filament has a lower linear charge density than DNA . Using the amino acid sequence of (cid:97) - skeletal muscle ac - tin , one residue of 3 - methylhistidine , an acetylated N terminus and one molecule each of tightly bound divalent cation and ATP ( 24 ) , each subunit of an actin filament bears 14 excess negative charges . In addition , roughly three histidines per monomer are likely to be protonated at pH 7 . 2 . Based on 370 monomers per micron contour length , the linear charge density is approxi - mately 4 e / nm . This value has two implications : the average charge spacing along the filament axis is sufficiently small compared to the Bjerrum length to make the counterion con - densation theory relevant ( (cid:122) (cid:53) (cid:108) B / b (cid:46) 1 ) ; but (cid:122) is less than that of DNA , suggesting that a smaller percentage of charge needs to be neutralized for condensation to occur ( Equation 1 ) . There - fore , one expects actin bundles to form at similar , but consist - ently lower , concentrations of cations compared to DNA . This prediction is tested by analysis of the effects of a variety of inorganic and organic cations , including the actin binding do - main of MARCKS 1 protein and the smooth muscle actin bind - ing protein calponin . MATERIALS AND METHODS Proteins— Monomeric ( G - ) actin was prepared from an acetone pow - der of rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt ( 25 ) . The nonpolymerizing solution contained 4 m M Hepes buffer at pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 2 m M CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 m M ATP , and 0 . 5 m M NaN 3 . The buffer concentration was sufficient to ensure the stability of pH , since concentrated reagents were frequently added to actin samples . Actin was polymerized by 150 m M KCl , unless mentioned otherwise . Human plasma gelsolin was purified by elution from DE52 ion ex - change matrix in 30 m M NaCl , 3 m M CaCl 2 , 25 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , as described by Kurokawa et al . ( 26 ) , rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:50) 80 °C . Recombinant chicken gizzard (cid:97) - calponin was produced as described in Gong et al . ( 51 ) and was a kind gift of T . Tao ( 27 ) . The lyophilized power was dissolved in 3 M KCl and dialyzed against 50 m M Hepes , 5 m M dithiothreitol , and 0 . 1 M KCl at pH 7 . 5 . A concentrated stock solution of up to 100 (cid:109) M was prepared , and the protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometry , assuming a specific absorbance of 0 . 74 ( mg / ml ) (cid:50) 1 cm (cid:50) 1 at 280 nm . Peptides— MARCKS peptide was purchased from Biomol , supplied as trifluoroacetate salt . A stock solution of 200 (cid:109) M peptide was prepared in 50 m M Hepes at pH 7 . 5 . Oligomers of arginine , lysine , histidine , and aspartic acid were synthesized and purified by Daina Biseniece , Ieva Liepkaula , and Ivars Lipsbergs at the Latvian Organic Synthesis In - stitute and were conveyed to us by Rolands Vegners . Polylysines of degree of polymerization larger than 10 were purchased from Sigma . All the other common chemicals are of research or analytical grade . Measurements— 90 degree light scattering measurements were per - formed using a Perkin - Elmer LS - 5B luminescence spectrometer . Dif - ferent settings of wavelength , slit combination , and sample cuvettes of several dimensions and geometries were explored to find experimental conditions with sufficient signal and minimal multiple scattering . The instrumental settings altered the magnitude of the signals but not the concentrations of cations at which scattering changes were evident . We initially chose 365 nm excitation and 375 nm emission to avoid reflec - tive signals , and slit widths of either 3 nm ( Figs . 1 , 3 , and 6 ) or 5 nm ( Figs . 2 , 7 , and 8 ) for both beams . Another frequently used setting was 365 nm / 370 nm wavelength and 3 nm / 3 nm slit width ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . High - UV transparent plastic cuvettes of 10 (cid:51) 5 - mm inside dimensions were used for 600 - (cid:109) l samples of low actin concentrations ( 0 . 1 – 1 . 0 mg / ml ) . Smaller glass tubes of 6 mm diameter were used for more concen - trated samples in order to avoid the saturation of light scattering signals ( Fig . 3 ) . Square cuvettes ( 10 (cid:51) 10 mm ) and a 1200 - (cid:109) l sample volume were used to generate the data of Fig . 6 b . Polycations and nucleoside phosphates were prepared as stock solutions at neutral pH at least 20 times more concentrated than required in the final mixtures . Dilution effects which amounted to less than 5 % were ignored . RESULTS Bundle Formation by Metal Ions and Polyamines— The for - mation of F - actin bundles is conveniently detected by changes in light scattering . Fig . 1 shows the bundle formation of 0 . 5 mg / ml F - actin induced by a number of polycations . All the polyvalent cations were added in the form of concentrated chloride salts to ensure that the variation among these data was not attributable to anion species . The concentration of cations needed for the onset of bundling increases with de - creased valence , indicating weakening ability to bundle . Hex - amers of arginine bundle more efficiently than those of histi - dine , apparently because they carry a higher amount of net positive charges . D - and L - lysine isomers had identical effects ( data not shown ) . The minimal bundling concentration of lysine hexamers ( not shown ) is almost the same as that of the argi - nine , indicating equally complete titration of one amine per side chain at pH 7 . 2 . An intriguing result is that oligohistidines are fairly efficient actin bundlers at neutral pH , although the p K value for its side chain amine is as low as 6 . 5 and hence most of the side chains should be neutral . These oligomers of histidine either have more specific binding to F - actin or else they form small aggregates capable of bundling actin . In order to confirm that an increase in light scattering cor - responds to bundling , F - actin samples at different light scat - tering levels due to additions of polycations were examined by electron microscopy ( EM ) , using the negative staining tech - nique . When light scattering signals remained at low levels , actin filaments appeared disperse or intertwined in loose iso - tropic networks . In contrast , large lateral aggregates were al - ways seen by EM at high light scattering levels . The bundling efficiency of different divalent metal ions in - creases with their atomic number . Co 2 (cid:49) bundles F - actin at 5 . 5 m M , Mn 2 (cid:49) at 7 m M , in comparison with Ca 2 (cid:49) at 20 m M and Mg 2 (cid:49) at 27 m M . This variation from 5 . 5 to 27 m M may correlate with ionic radius and extent of hydration . Such cation - specific effects cannot be explained by the Manning theory . The general behavior shown in Fig . 1 can be qualitatively explained by the predictions of the polyelectrolyte theory . Assuming an average linear charge density of 4 e / nm and applying the counterion condensation theory of Manning , a layer of condensed counterions is predicted near the F - actin surface . With 150 m M KCl and no polyvalent cations , the most simplified Manning model estimates K (cid:49) in this layer to be about 60 % ( Equation 1 ) of the total net surface charge of F - actin . If divalent cations are abundant in solution , the 1 The abbreviation used is : MARCKS , myristoylated alanine - rich pro - tein kinase C substrate . F IG . 1 .

Each sample contained initially 0 . 5 mg / ml F - actin at pH 7 . 2 , followed by sequential additions of concen - trated cations . The scattering was measured at 90 degrees , with 365 nm / 370 nm wavelength and 3 nm / 3 nm slit width ( details under “Ma - terials and Methods” ) .

F - actin forms stable bundles at 150 m M KCl with order of 10 m M divalent cations , suggesting that approximately 80 % neutralization of the surface charge is required for bundle formation . This is a less stringent condition than that for DNA , in which case 90 % of the charge needs to be neutralized for the transition to occur . The increased bundle formation by Co ( NH 3 ) 6 3 (cid:49) and polyamines compared with divalent cations is due to the higher apparent binding constants at higher valence , as pre - dicted in the Manning theory ( 12 ) . Unique Effects of Specific Cu 2 (cid:49) Binding— Deviations from the predictions of counterion condensation reveal specific bind - ing of cationic ligands . Bundling of F - actin by Cu 2 (cid:49) is not consistent with purely electrostatic binding . Fig . 2 a shows the light scattering measurements after sequential additions of Cu 2 (cid:49) to 0 . 2 mg / ml F - actin in 150 m M KCl , without and with 20 m M MgCl 2 . For this set of experiments , we used a modified actin buffer containing 2 m M Tris at pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 m M ATP , and 0 . 2 m M CaCl 2 . This change was necessary since Cu 2 (cid:49) forms insoluble precipitates with Hepes . It may also interact with dithiothreitol and NaN 3 . In the absence of MgCl 2 , large F - actin bundles start forming at 0 . 4 m M Cu 2 (cid:49) , a much lower value than required for other divalent cations shown in Fig . 1 . This obser - vation may be explained by specific binding of Cu 2 (cid:49) to the C terminus of actin with high affinity ( 28 , 29 ) , causing a reduc - tion in the surface charge of F - actin . Although binding between Cu 2 (cid:49) and the actin C terminus is of micromolar affinity , 0 . 4 m M Cu 2 (cid:49) is required to form actin bundles because an additional fraction of the charge must be neutralized by lower affinity interactions . In an attempt to distinguish these two components , MgCl 2 was first added to the F - actin solution to 20 m M , in which condition the surface charge of F - actin should be neutralized to a large extent , but not enough to form bundles . A slight , yet reproducible increase in the light scattering signal was meas - ured following addition of MgCl 2 to 20 m M , which may corre - spond to some other forms of aggregation , such as the fishnet - like paracrystalline structures ( types I and II ) characterized by a previous EM study ( 1 ) . Addition of as little as 25 (cid:109) M Cu 2 (cid:49) causes a significant increase in light scattering , and the high level scattering at 50 (cid:109) M Cu 2 (cid:49) indicates extensive bundle formation . A complementary set of measurements is shown in Fig . 2 b , in which 0 . 2 mg / ml F - actin was first treated with various amounts of Cu 2 (cid:49) and its effect on bundling was compared with sequential addition of MgCl 2 . While 10 (cid:109) M Cu 2 (cid:49) does not affect the onset of bundling by MgCl 2 , 50 (cid:109) M Cu 2 (cid:49) facilitates bundle formation with only 15 m M MgCl 2 as opposed to about 30 m M required without Cu 2 (cid:49) . The decreased amount of Mg 2 (cid:49) re - quired for bundling is due to the reduction of surface charge on F - actin caused by the tight specific binding of Cu 2 (cid:49) . Dependence on F - actin Concentration— The amount of poly - cation required to bundle different concentrations of polyelec - trolyte provides information about the affinity of the interac - F IG . 3 Effects of F - actin concentration on the bundle forma - tion induced by Lys 18 . a , bundle formation by Lys 18 of F - actin in 150 m M KCl at 3 representative concentrations : 0 . 1 , 2 . 0 , and 6 . 0 mg / ml .

Fig . 3 a shows the increase of light scattering when actin bundling occurs with sequential addition of 18 - mers of lysine Lys 18 to various concentrations of F - actin . The dotted lines indicate where the scattering signals increase steeply at low concentrations , or roughly double at high actin concentra - tions . This point is selected as the concentration of Lys 18 re - quired for paracrystal formation . At high actin concentrations , the scattering intensity is relatively high prior to any bundling activity , and the increase in scattering at the onset of bundle formation is blunted by multiple scattering . Fig . 3 b shows that the amount of Lys 18 required to bundle actin increases approximately linearly with the actin concen - tration . The intercept of the vertical axis from a linear fit , c 18 (cid:53) 19 . 4 (cid:109) M , is the concentration of free Lys 18 necessary to induce bundling . The slope of 0 . 26 Lys 18 per actin monomer deter - mines the molar ratio of Lys 18 to actin in the bundled state . Assuming that each actin monomer carries 11 e of negative charge in the polymerized form , the number of bound polyly - sine per charge on the actin filament is (cid:117) 18 (cid:53) 0 . 26 / 11 (cid:53) 0 . 024 . This number implies that about 40 % ( (cid:117) 18 (cid:51) 18 ) of the actin surface charge is neutralized by the lysine residues at the onset of bundling . Consistent with the Manning theory , an additional 40 % or so is neutralized by the excess K (cid:49) to make up to 80 % as the criterion for bundling to occur . In order to explain the linear relationship measured in Fig . 3 , it is helpful to first elucidate the concept of condensation zone , and how its volume is related to the molar concentration of actin . Manning introduced V P as the volume of condensation per molar charge of the polyelectrolyte , within which counteri - ons are bound ( 12 ) . At excess univalent electrolyte , V P can be calculated as the following , V P (cid:53) 41 . 1 (cid:126) (cid:122)(cid:50) 1 (cid:33) b 3 ( Eq . 2 ) where V P has the units of cm 3 / mol if b is expressed in Å . For F - actin , since b (cid:53) 2 . 5 Å and (cid:122) (cid:53) 7 . 1 / b (cid:53) 2 . 8 , we estimate V P to be 1 . 2 (cid:51) 10 3 cm 3 / mol , or equivalently 1 . 2 M (cid:50) 1 . The constant value for V P implies that the total volume of condensation zone is directly proportional to the molar concentration of actin . Based on this property , a brief derivation in the appendix predicts a behavior which is consistent with Fig . 3 b . This simple exercise with the Manning theory further pre - dicts the local ion concentration of Lys 18 as c loc (cid:53) (cid:117) 18 / V P (cid:53) 0 . 02 M . The association constant , defined as the ratio of concentra - tions of localized to free counterions , K (cid:53) c loc / c 18 , is therefore on the order of 20 m M / 20 (cid:109) M (cid:53) 10 3 for the case of Lys 18 with 150 m M KCl in solution . In Fig . 3 b the minimal bundling concentration of Lys 18 is in the micromolar range , comparable to the range of F - actin concentration . In the case of divalent and trivalent cations , millimolar concentrations of free cations are required for bundle formation , and the amount sequestered by actin fila - ments is negligible . Measurements similar to those of Fig . 3 using Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) showed no apparent dependence of the min - imal bundling concentration on actin concentration from 0 . 1 to 5 . 0 mg / ml within our experimental error of approximately 10 % . Effects of Filament Length— Although the original counte - rion condensation theory assumes filaments to be infinitely long , we have made no attempt to conduct our measurements with extremely long actin filament . On the contrary , small quantities ( 1 : 500 molar ratio ) of gelsolin , an actin severing protein were generally added to F - actin in order to reduce the filament length to an average of 1 . 6 micron and thereby reduce solution viscosity ( 30 ) . A systematic test of a possible length dependence for bundling of actin by polycations was made by varying the gelsolin : actin ratio . Fig . 4 shows the light scatter - ing increases caused by adding Lys 18 to 0 . 2 mg / ml F - actin solution containing various amounts of gelsolin . The onset bun - dling profile varies very little until the filaments contain 50 monomers ( 140 nm ) on average . This result implies that the basic prediction of charge condensation is applicable to cylin - drical filaments of sufficiently large aspect ratios ( (cid:46) 20 : 1 ) . Effects of Ionic Strength— A direct consequence of the Man - ning theory is that the association constant , K , is a function of the solution ionic strength , c , as shown below , log K (cid:53) c onstant (cid:50) N log c ( Eq . 3 ) where N is the valence of the small cation . This dependence is only correct for a trace amount of polyvalent counterions in the presence of excess monovalent counterions . Otherwise , the Manning one variable approach predicts a similar power law dependence with a slope varying between 1 and N in the log - log plot , which approaches 1 with increased concentration of the polyvalent counterion . In addition , such dependence is ex - pected to hold only at c (cid:44) 0 . 1 M . In practice , testing the ionic strength dependence for F - actin bundles is limited to high ionic strength ( order of 100 m M KCl ) , or with 2 m M MgCl 2 in solution in order to keep actin polymerized prior to adding polycations . 0 . 2 m M Ca 2 (cid:49) and 0 . 5 m M ATP are also present in the usual buffer solutions . Nevertheless , one should still expect a marked effect of ionic strength on the minimal concentrations of poly - cation needed to induce bundling . Fig . 5 a displays the increasing amount of Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) re - quired to form actin bundles in solutions of increasing KCl concentration . Fig . 5 b shows the functional dependence be - tween [ Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) ] and [ KCl ] . Assuming that the concentra - tion of Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) ions in the condensation layer reaches a fixed value of [ Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) ] b at the onset of bundle formation , the relation K (cid:53) [ Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) ] b / [ Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) ] and the Manning theory predicts a linear dependence between log [ Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) ] and log [ KCl ] with a slope between 1 and 3 . However , a linear fit to the data of Fig . 5 b gives a slope of roughly 0 . 74 . A similar experiment using Mn 2 (cid:49) instead of Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) gave a slope value as small as 0 . 20 ( Fig . 5 b ) . These values of less than one may be partially attributed to the complication in ionic conditions as addressed above , and to a number of oversimplified assumptions in the simplest Manning treat - ment . For instance , at the onset bundling condition the con - centration of Co ( NH 3 ) 63 (cid:49) in the condensed layer may depend on the solution ionic strength . In addition , the assumption of a charged line for F - actin is apparently oversimplified . F IG . 4 . Comparison of bundle formation by F - actin of various lengths . Actin concentration is 0 . 2 mg / ml for all the samples , with different gelsolin : actin ratios as noted in the figure . The average fila - ment length is 1 . 35 (cid:109) m at 1 : 500 molar ratio of gelsolin ( gel ) to actin .

Dissociation by Nucleotides and Other Polyanions— Addition of millimolar ATP has been reported to dissolve actin bundles formed by spermine and spermidine ( 4 ) , and some actin cross - linking or bundling proteins ( 31 – 33 ) . A very similar reversibil - ity was found to apply to actin bundles formed by several of the polycations tested . A typical example is shown in Fig . 6 a for actin bundles formed by Lys 18 . Millimolar concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates such as ATP , CTP , and GTP are equally efficient in dissociating actin bundles . This reversal is consistent with competitive binding between polyanionic nu - cleotides and the polycations that cause actin bundling , and does not imply a specific binding of nucleotides to the actin filaments . Therefore , the process may be purely electrostatic and hence structurally nonspecific . The dependence of this effect on electrostatic charge rather than on specific structures of nucleotides is confirmed by the data of Fig . 6 b showing that the ability to dissolve actin bundles decreases with the number of phosphates , and therefore the anionic charge , in adenine nucleotides . Di ( adenosine - 5 (cid:57) ) pentaphosphate and hexamers of aspartic acid dissolved the actin bundles at even lower concen - trations , due to higher anionic valence ( not shown ) . Bundling by MARCKS Peptide— To extend the applicability of counterion effects to other agents that may function in vivo , experiments similar to those shown in Fig . 1 were done with the actin - binding domain of the myristoylated , alanine - rich C kinase substrate ( MARCKS ) , a physiologically regulated actin binding protein implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization ( 34 ) . A peptide based on the sequence of this domain , KKKKKRFS - FKKSFKLSGFSFKKNKK , bundles F - actin , and the bundling activity is lost upon phosphorylation or binding to Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin ( 34 ) .

In all three cases the preformed bundles dissolved after addition of millimolar ATP ( not shown ) . It is therefore likely that the MARCKS peptide bundles actin as a consequence of its binding to the negatively charged actin surface , thereby neu - tralizing its electrostatic charge . In addition , cross - bridging of F - actin by long peptides may enhance bundling efficiency and possibly account for the finding that the MARCKS peptide of 14 net positive charges bundles actin more efficiently than 18 - mers of lysine , since the charges on the MARCKS peptide are mainly distributed at both ends of a longer sequence . It is also possible that the MARCKS peptide self - associates into dimers or trimers and hence becomes more efficient in bundling F - actin . Bundling by Smooth Muscle Calponin— Bundling of actin by intact proteins can also follow the predictions of counterion condensation . The smooth muscle isoform of calponin is highly basic , with roughly 8 net positive charges at neutral pH . It binds F - actin with high affinity , and the binding is reversed by phosphorylation ( 35 ) . Fig . 8 a shows the bundling of F - actin by calponin at 30 , 50 , and 75 m M KCl . An identical experiment with 150 m M KCl did not show a sharp increase in the light scattering at up to 6 (cid:109) M calponin . These data demonstrate features qualitatively similar to those of cobalt hexamine shown in Fig . 5 . Fig . 8 b shows that the dissociation of calponin / F - actin bundles by millimolar concentrations of ATP , ADP , and AMP is nearly identical to the dissolution of actin - lysine bun - dles ( Fig . 6 b ) . The bundling of actin by the basic isoform of smooth muscle calponin is consistent with an electrostatic mechanism like that of other polycations . In addition to the light scattering experiments , analysis of co - sedimentation of calponin with F - actin revealed that in equimolar mixture ( roughly 4 (cid:109) M of each protein ) the amount of calponin bound to F - actin decreased continuously with increas - ing ionic strength . 2 This result is consistent with an electro - static model of binding , and the behavior at least partially accounts for the conflicting reports in literature of the binding stoichiometry between calponin and F - actin ( 32 , 35 – 37 ) . DISCUSSION Theories for counterion condensation by linear polyelectro - lytes can explain the formation of actin bundles by agents as diverse as metal ions , inorganic polycations , polyamines , ho - mopolymers of basic amino acids , peptides identified as specific actin binding sites , and intact actin binding proteins . These theories have many implications for actin structure and func - tion , and possibly for other cytoskeletal biopolymers . The most direct implication is that proteins with sufficient numbers of positive charges , exposed appropriately on their surface , will inevitably bind to actin filaments even in solutions of physiologic ionic strength and often with relatively high ( (cid:109) M ) affinity . It has been noted that there are surprisingly many F - actin binding proteins , but no obvious consensus F - actin binding site has been identified ( 38 – 40 ) . Given the strong electrostatic effects between polyelectrolytes and their counte - rions , the binding of some proteins to F - actin may be largely independent of unique tertiary structures that form tight spe - cific binding interfaces typical of the protein / protein bonds that have been identified for several G - actin binding proteins . The relatively nonspecific nature of the electrostatic forces by which some proteins may bind F - actin does not necessarily mean that these interactions have no relevance in vivo . On the contrary , the filament density in cells is high compared to what can be achieved in vitro , and ionic fluxes are both common and poorly understood . The results of this work suggest that proteins that interact primarily or exclusively by electrostatic interactions can cause bundling of F - actin when present at micromolar concentrations , and such bundles can be dissolved by increas - ing ionic strength , protein phosphorylation , or by changes in nucleotide concentrations in the millimolar range . The effects of polycations on F - actin show that cross - linking is not always required for bundle formation , and neutralization of sufficient surface charge on F - actin can directly induce bun - dling . Many actin binding domains are rich in positive charge , and long range electrostatic interaction may dominate their binding to F - actin . In this interpretation , an actin bundling protein need not contain two distinct actin binding domains , nor is dimerization required . Cross - links between parallel fil - aments shown in electron microscopy in some cases are per - haps merely the result of steric hindrance , and their locations are often of a stochastic nature . In the case of lateral aggrega - tion , there is no absolute requirement for locking the filaments at the opposite sites of actin bundling proteins , although the presence of such links caused by specific actin bundling pro - teins , such as the acidic proteins fimbrin or villin , can modulate the structure of such bundles ( 39 ) . The analogy between bundling F - actin and DNA condensa - tion should also be applicable to other charged biopolymers such as microtubules , intermediate filaments , filamentous bac - 2 J . X .

The electrostatic fea - tures such as the requirement of polycationic protein domains and the extreme sensitivity to ionic strength have been exam - ined for lateral association of microtubules ( 41 , 42 ) . Parallel experiments to those reported in this paper have been extended to fd and tobacco mosaic virus suspensions ( 43 ) . The nonspe - cific electrostatic model also explains the co - bundling of differ - ent filament types such as actin and microtubules ( 44 ) , and the finding that microtubule associated proteins MAP2 and (cid:116) frag - ments bind and bundle F - actin ( 45 , 46 ) , as well as microtubules . In addition to the formation of supermolecular aggregates , the structural dynamics of single actin filament can also be altered by the ions surrounding it , even if these ions do not have specific binding sites on the protein . Polymerization and depolymerization are extremely sensitive to the ionic condi - tions in solution . Many actin bundling factors accelerate actin polymerization even at lower concentrations than required for inducing the lateral aggregation of F - actin ( 47 ) . Since the condensed counterions on the surface of either F - actin or microtubules move freely along the filament axis , cells may transport metal ions such as Ca 2 (cid:49) preferentially along these filaments . This so - called cable - like property has been reported for F - actin ( 48 ) , and the role of microtubules in intracellular transport may also relate to the similar polyelec - trolyte nature . Charge differences in actin subunits often occur and can accordingly alter the structure of the filament or its ability to interact with other proteins electrostatically . For example , when P i is released from actin filament following hydrolysis of the actin - bound ATP to ADP - P i , the surface charge density of the filament falls approximately 9 % ( 1 / 11 ) . An opposite effect would occur if actin rebound P i or became phosphorylated . Similarly , (cid:103) and (cid:98) nonmuscle actin isoforms have one or two fewer net negative charges than (cid:97) - actin according to their amino acid sequence . Filaments formed by these isoforms might be more susceptible to bundling at borderline conditions , and such differences may relate to the partitioning of actin isoforms into specific structures within a cell . In a similar vein , mutations which reduce the net negative charge of actin have reportedly caused the mutant actin filaments to spontaneously bundle ( 49 , 50 ) . These observations provide additional evidence for the polyelectrolyte nature of F - actin and its related properties . Applying the electrostatic model to the association between F - actin and actin binding proteins does not alter the impor - tance of additional binding forces due to the large size and the structural variations of intact proteins . This model does not exclude the dominant effects of specific actin binding sites . Although the specific binding site may be closely related to the distribution of charged residues , the individual tertiary struc - tures and regions of compatible hydrophobicity must also con - tribute to the overall association . Therefore , the sole consider - ation of polyelectrolyte properties of F - actin should not be exaggerated in an attempt to explain every aspect of F - actin related associations . On the other hand in those cases where tight and specific actin binding sites cannot be identified , these electrostatic interactions can lead to bindings that are remark - ably efficient and regulated by physiologic signals .

APPENDIX We provide here a simple derivation following a chemical binding model as elucidated by Manning ( 12 ) . Assuming 18 - mers of lysine , Lys 18 binds to F - actin with an apparent affinity k (cid:53) [ Lys 18 ] b / [ Lys 18 ] f , where [ Lys 18 ] f is the concentration of free lysine in solution and [ Lys 18 ] b is the local concentration of lysine in the condensed region surrounding F - actin . Both k and [ Lys 18 ] b are functions of the ionic strength of the excess mono - valent salt and are independent of F - actin concentration . We assume that side - by - side aggregates start to appear at a critical concentration of [ Lys 18 ] f . This corresponds to an unde - termined , but fixed total fraction of charge neutralization of F - actin (cid:117) , which can be obtained if a Scatchard plot is provided . In the absence of other ligands , the total concentration of oligolysine [ Lys 18 ] o is an appropriate summation of [ Lys 18 ] b and [ Lys 18 ] f as shown in the following equation , (cid:64) Lys 18 (cid:35) o (cid:53) (cid:64) Lys 18 (cid:35) f (cid:49) v (cid:64) Lys 18 (cid:35) b (cid:53) (cid:64) Lys 18 (cid:35) f (cid:49) kv (cid:64) Lys 18 (cid:35) f ( Eq . 4 ) where v (cid:44)(cid:44) 1 is the volume fraction of the condensation zone surrounding F - actin in solution , and is proportional to actin concentration at a given ionic strength . Note that the volume fraction which F - actin occupies is neglected in the above expression . Experimentally , since there is usually 0 . 5 m M ATP in F - actin buffer , possible formation of lysine - ATP complex should be taken into account . The complete expression based on Eq . 4 is shown below . (cid:64) Lys 18 (cid:35) o (cid:53) (cid:64) Lys 18 (cid:35) f (cid:49) (cid:64) Lys 18 (cid:126) ATP (cid:33) m (cid:35) (cid:49) kv (cid:64) Lys 18 (cid:35) f ( Eq . 5 ) In the above formula , the linear dependence of [ Lys 18 ] o on F - actin concentration is preserved in v , in spite of the compli - cation due to the presence of ATP , an interacting polyion of the opposite charge .
