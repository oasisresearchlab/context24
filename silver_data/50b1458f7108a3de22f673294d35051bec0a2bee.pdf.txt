Patterning mechanisms of cytoskeletal and cell wall systems during leaf trichome morphogenesis Makoto Yanagisawa 1 , Anastasia S . Desyatova 2 , Samuel A . Belteton 1 , Eileen L . Mallery 1 , Joseph A . Turner 2 and Daniel B . Szymanski 1 , 3 * The plant actin cytoskeleton is an unstable network of ﬁ laments that in ﬂ uences polarized growth through poorly understood mechanisms . Here , we used a combination of live cell imaging and ﬁ nite element computational modelling of Arabidopsis trichome morphogenesis to determine how the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons cooperate to pattern the cell wall and growth . The actin - related protein ( ARP ) 2 / 3 complex generates an actin meshwork that operates within a tip - localized , microtubule - depleted zone to modulate cell wall anisotropy locally . The actin meshwork also positions an actin bundle network that organizes organelle ﬂ ow patterns . This activity is required to maintain cell wall thickness gradients that enable tip - biased diffuse growth . These newly discovered couplings between cytoskeletal patterns and wall textures provide important insights into the cellular mechanism of growth control in plants . T he microtubule and actin cytoskeletons cooperate to in ﬂ uence shape change in both metazoan 1 and plant 2 cells . In plants , these cytoskeletal systems locally modulate the mechanical properties of the cell wall 3 , 4 , and in the epidermis , heterogeneities in wall texture guide the complex patterns of irreversible cell expan - sion 5 . In leaves , these growth patterns are important because they can persist for days 6 , 7 and in ﬂ uence organ size and shape 8 . Microtubule - dependent cellulose micro ﬁ bril patterning is one central feature of polarized diffuse growth 9 , 10 ; however , the means by which the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons cooperate during cell morphogenesis is poorly understood . Leaf trichomes , specialized leaf epidermal cells that protect the growing organ against insect attack 11 , like single - celled cotton ﬁ bres 12 , are model cell types that can be used to analyse how the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons control polarized growth 13 , 14 . The distorted Arabidopsis leaf trichome mutants identi ﬁ ed an evolu - tionarily conserved actin ﬁ lament nucleation pathway , in which the WAVE / SCAR regulatory complex ( W / SRC ) 15 positively regulates the actin ﬁ lament nucleator ARP2 / 3 16 – 18 . Although it is known that W / SRC – ARP2 / 3 is required to maintain organized actin bundle networks and polarized cell elongation 13 , 17 , 19 – 21 , the mechan - isms by which it in ﬂ uences the cell wall properties that determine the growth behaviours of the cell are not known . Here we integrate live cell imaging and computational analyses of the cell wall to determine how an ARP2 / 3 - generated apical actin meshwork in ﬂ u - ences cell wall properties that de ﬁ ne the geometry of shape change . Creation of a plausible ﬁ nite element model Branch elongation and tip re ﬁ nement are de ﬁ ning features of trichome morphogenesis 13 , but at present there are no clear hypoth - eses about what combinations of cell wall mechanical properties would be needed to generate this type of shape change . Finite element computational modelling is a useful framework to simulate the complex relationships between turgor pressure , cell wall mech - anical properties and growth 4 . To parameterize a ﬁ nite element model of the cell wall and branch elongation , we conducted a series of re ﬂ ected light time - lapse imaging experiments ( Supplementary Fig . 1 and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Branch diameter at the base was nearly constant during growth , as would be expected for tip growth 4 . Unlike the tip growth of pollen tubes and root hairs in which the tip radius is quite constant , the radius of curvature at the tip decreased from ∼ 4 µm to ∼ 0 . 5 µm as the branch elongated ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Branch growth rates varied considerably during mor - phogenesis ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) , but there was a general trend towards higher elongation rates as the branches increased in length . For example , short branches between 20 and 30 µm elongated at a rate of 3 . 1 ± 1 . 0 µm h – 1 , which was signi ﬁ cantly less than the growth rate of branches in the 50 – 60 µm range , which was 5 . 8 ± 1 . 5 µm h – 1 ( P = 0 . 003 ) . On the basis of the shape change that occurs and on direct measurements of wall strain using cell wall bound pariticles 13 , 22 , it is known that trichome morphogenesis includes a diffuse growth component . To measure wall strain patterns directly at high spatial resolution , externally applied ﬂ uorescent beads were used as ﬁ ducial marks along the branch axis ( Fig . 1c ) . Particle tracking of bead pairs detected an axial strain gradient , in which distal regions of the branch grew at signi ﬁ cantly faster rates than the branch base ( Fig . 1d ) . Therefore , the early stages of branch elongation include highly polarized anisotropic diffuse growth and tip re ﬁ nement to a ﬁ nal radius of 0 . 61 ± 0 . 12 µm ( n = 20 ) . Our analysis captured the signi ﬁ cant shape change during branch development because mature branches that exceed 200 µm in length have similar length to width aspect ratios and tip geometry 13 . Organized microtubules and cellulose micro ﬁ brils are required for polarized branch growth 10 , 13 , 14 . To quantify the degree of poten - tial microtubule - based micro ﬁ bril ordering , we measured the microtubule angle distribution relative to the longitudinal axis of the cell ( Fig . 1f ) . As expected , microtubules and the cellulose synthase ( CESA ) complex had a similar transverse alignment ( Fig . 1e , g ) . However , the branch apex always contained an obvious microtubule - depleted zone ( MDZ ) that lacked patterned CESA localization . An MDZ has been previously reported in the literature using different microtubule markers 21 , 23 , indicating that the branch apex wall has a more isotropic character than the ﬂ ank . 1 Department of Botany and Plant Pathology , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , USA . 2 Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering , University of Nebraska - Lincoln , Lincoln , Nebraska 68588 , USA . 3 Biological Sciences , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , USA . * e - mail : dszyman @ purdue . edu ARTICLES PUBLISHED : 2 MARCH 2015 | ARTICLE NUMBER : 15014 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / NPLANTS . 2015 . 14 NATURE PLANTS | VOL 1 | MARCH 2015 | www . nature . com / natureplants 1 © 201 5 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Finite element modelling has been used to analyse the shape change of thin - walled pressurized plant cells 4 , and can incorporate realistic material models of ﬁ bres reinforcing a matrix 24 , 25 . Spatial heterogeneities in the model were introduced by subdividing the shell from the tip to the base into multiple sections with varying properties ( Fig . 2a and see Methods ) . Finite element simulations identi ﬁ ed wall parameters that affected the rate of cell expansion and growth anisotropy ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . For example , the degree of ﬁ bre orientation strongly affected anisotropic expansion ( Fig . 2b ) . The measured microtubule angle distributions ( Fig . 1f ) provided experimental support for highly ordered ﬁ bres with κ = 0 . 141 ± 0 . 029 , which could generate branches with the observed high length to width aspect ratios ( Fig . 2b ) . Anisotropic branch expansion was also sensitive to the ratio of ﬁ bre to matrix elastic moduli ( k 1 / E 0 ) of the wall ( Fig . 2c ) .

The experimentally observed values of branch width to length slope of 0 . 064 ± 0 . 026 and κ provided the value of k 1 / E 0 = 8 . 4 . Importance of a tip isotropic zone and a thickness gradient These combinations of k 1 / E 0 and κ could reproduce the observed global aspect ratios of branch growth , but could not generate the reproducible patterns of tip re ﬁ nement ( Fig . 2e ) and unequal axial strain ( Fig . 2f ) that were measured in the time - lapse analyses . Live cell measurements indicated that reductions in tip radius and MDZ size were highly correlated , and that the MDZ was ef ﬁ ciently centred on the branch axis ( Fig . 3g , i ) , suggesting that an isotropic branch tip was involved in cell shape control . The ﬁ nite element simulations showed that the trajectories of simulated tip re ﬁ nement were very sensitive to the size of the tip isotropic zone ( TIZ ) . Intermediate TIZs yielded better ﬁ ts to the observed growth pat - terns ; however , no single value performed the best for all simulation cycles ( Fig . 2e ) . The modelling results and the coupled geometry of the MDZ and the branch tip radius of curvature suggest that the smooth progression of tip re ﬁ nement includes modulation of the size of an apical cell wall domain with isotropic mechanical proper - ties ( see below ) . Finally , the observed apical to basal strain gradients that were detected in the bead labelling experiments ( Fig . 1c , d ) were studied . Finite element simulations that included ﬁ ducial marks could not reproduce the experimentally measured strain gradients unless a proximo - distal gradient was introduced in either elastic modulus or wall thickness ( Fig . 2f ) . These ﬁ nite element simulations motivated experiments to quan - tify the predicted cell wall thickness gradient in trichome branches . First , wall thickness measurements were taken from transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images of medial longitudinal sections through young trichome branches ( Fig . 2g ) . There were local vari - ations in wall thickness ; however , on the basis of an approximated linear relationship between cell wall thickness and distance from the branch tip , there was a positive correlation ( Fig . 2h ) . The mag - nitude of the tip to base wall thickness gradient for the wild type was 2 . 49 , and similar values were obtained in replicate TEM analyses of the adjacent wall of the same cell and the walls of another indepen - dent cell ( Supplementary Fig . 2a – c ) . To increase our sample size and our con ﬁ dence in the TEM results we used propidium iodide to quantify cell wall thickness variation 26 . The normalized propidium iodide signal was also correlated with distance from the branch tip ( Fig . 2i ) . The propidium iodide variation was not caused by cell geometry effects at the image plane , because the signal of FM1 - 43 , which labels the plasma membrane , had a negative corre - lation with distance from the tip ( Supplementary Fig . 2d – g ) .

Moreover , a combination of the measured thickness gradient with an elastic modulus gradient resulted in unrealistic growth predictions ( Fig . 2f ) , such that the simultaneous existence of a signi ﬁ cant matrix modulus gradient was excluded . The optimized ﬁ nite element model was used to simulate spatial stress and strain distributions of the young trichome branch ( Fig . 2j , k ) . The cell radius and wall thickness both contribute to the expected increase in the distribution of stress and strain 28 . The sharp circular band of high stress near the branch apex is likely to be an overesti - mate due to the assumed abrupt transition from an anisotropic ﬂ ank to isotropic tip in the ﬁ nite element simulations . The simulated strain distribution of the wall was consistent with the experimental bead labelling data . Because of the known importance of actin for long - distance transport and secretion of new cell wall material , the model was also used to quantify the amount of new wall material needed to maintain thickness during cell expansion ( Fig . 2l ) . It can be seen that there is a relatively shallow gradient of newly added material with higher values per element at the branch base . This result is expected because the base is initially thicker and more material is needed to maintain the initial thickness even though the strains are lower at the branch base . The simulation and wall marking data indicate that the mechanism of trichome morphogen - esis bears little or no resemblance to tip growth , and instead is accomplished by highly regulated anisotropic diffuse growth in which spatial gradients in wall thickness and texture dictate the growth patterns . Function of ARP2 / 3 - generated actin networks Microtubule - dependent micro ﬁ bril patterning operates at cellular spatial scales to enable polarized branch elongation ; however , the location and function of the most critical actin ﬁ lament arrays are not known .

ARP2 / 3 complex is disassembled 32 , and following branch initiation the branch base and stalk were swollen ( Fig . 3a ) . The terminal arpc2 phenotype is a reduced branch length and severe cell swelling 33 . Time - lapse analyses of arpc2 branches were technically challenging due to cell twisting and swelling . However , it was possible to obtain several time - lapse data sets ( Supplementary Movie 2 and Fig . 3 ) , albeit with some missing data points due to poor image quality . The growth of arpc2 trichomes was inconsistent , switching repeat - edly among paused , slow and normal growth rates ( Fig . 3b , c ) . Because of the low success rate in imaging mutant branch growth , we had to resort to using visible cell wall protuberances to measure the local strain patterns instead of exogenously applied beads . The fast - growing arpc2 branch shown in Fig . 3b did not have an increased strain rate in the distal regions of the branch ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . We next tested for a cell wall thickness gradient in developing arpc2 branches . Unlike the wild type ( Fig . 2g – i ) , the mutant branches lacked a clear tip to base thickness gradient based on the regression analyses of the TEM and propidium iodide image data ( Fig . 3d – f and Supplementary Fig . 3b – d ) . The arpc2 cell walls had a signi ﬁ cantly increased thickness of 202 . 4 ± 11 . 8 nm compared with 109 . 7 ± 22 . 7 for the wild type . The wall was cellulose - rich , as observed in glancing TEM sections of the wall , with obvious ﬁ brillar texture that was transverse to the branch axis and parallel to cortical microtubules that were present in the mutant ( Supplementary Fig . 3e – g ) . Microtubule - based CESA insertion does not require an intact actin cytoskeleton 34 . In aprc2 trichomes , growth and wall assembly are partially uncoupled , perhaps because cellulose synthesis is not coordinated with the delivery of wall matrix and / or wall loosening factors that enable normal wall strain behaviours . ARP2 / 3 has a second function at the branch tip based on the episo - dic and incomplete tip radius of curvature re ﬁ nement detected in arpc2 ( Fig . 3c ) . To test for an effect of arpc2 on the MDZ and the predicted TIZ , microtubule localization was analysed in a popu - lation of arpc2 branches . Although the MDZ was clearly present in the mutant ( Supplementary Fig . 3f ) , its size was uncoupled from the geometry of the cell tip and its centring at the branch apex was less accurate than the wild type ( Fig . 3g – i ) . Therefore , ARP2 / 3 is not required to generate an MDZ , but may function either directly or indirectly with other ROP signalling pathways that locally destabilize microtubules 35 , 36 , to position the microtubule free zone and modulate its size during tip re ﬁ nement . Our growth analyses suggested that ARP2 / 3 generates actin net - works that have a global in ﬂ uence on the cell wall thickness gradient within a branch and a local in ﬂ uence on wall isotropy at the tip . In other systems , ARP2 / 3 and its generated actin networks localize at the leading edge of motile cells 37 and at sites of endocytic vesicle internalization in yeast 38 – 40 . However , the location of active ARP2 / 3 has not been clearly determined in any plant cell type . We therefore created a fully functional green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged version of the ARPC5 subunit ( Supplementary Fig . 4a – h ) . ARPC5 functions in the context of an evolutionarily conserved ARP2 / 3 complex 32 ; therefore , it is referred to as ARP2 / 3 - GFP .

ARP2 / 3 and the known W / SRC subunit BRICK1 41 – 43 were clustered at the apex in 28 % and 66 % of the stage 4 branches , respectively ( Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig . 4i ) . The signi ﬁ - cance of the reversible recruitment of ARP2 / 3 to the branch apex could not be analysed because of photobleaching ; however , when present at the tip ARP2 / 3 remained there for minutes . It is possible that BRICK1 and ARP2 / 3 clustering at the apex is episodic , and may correlate with growth rate ﬂ uctuations that were observed in time - lapse imaging studies ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In pavement cells , a signi ﬁ cant fraction of ARP2 / 3 appears to be inactive because its clustering on actin - bundle - associated organelles occurs even when the W / SRC is mutated 44 . In trichomes , tip - localized ARP2 / 3 corre - sponded to an active pool of the complex , because this localization was eliminated in arpc2 ( Fig . 4b ) , which leads to ARP2 / 3 disassem - bly 32 and in nap1 / gnarled 19 , 45 , which eliminates W / SRC - dependent positive regulation of fully assembled ARP2 / 3 ( Fig . 4c ) . The impor - tance of W / SRC for the local recruitment of ARP2 / 3 , either from soluble or organelle - associated pools 32 , may explain the more per - sistent localization of BRICK1 to the apex than ARP2 / 3 . It is also possible that ARP2 / 3 functions more transiently at the apex as it cycles through rounds of activation and release . Apical ARP2 / 3 was capable of generating actin ﬁ laments because it co - localized with cortical actin meshworks ( Fig . 4d , e ) and the tip - localized actin was ARP2 / 3 dependent ( Fig . 4f – h ) . The presence of an apical actin meshwork was positively correlated with growth , because it was absent in arpc2 , and only reduced in the arpc5 ( Supplementary Table 3 ) , which has a more mild branch length phe - notype than arpc2 42 . These genetic and co - localization results clearly demonstrate that the tip - localized ARP2 / 3 is active . The ARP2 / 3 - generated cortical actin was related to core actin bundle positioning at the apex , because in 90 % ( n = 20 ) of the cases in which the apical meshwork was present , core actin bundles terminated at or near it ( Fig . 4d , f ) . This result is consistent with previous reports of actin at the branch apex , and the known ARP2 / 3 dependence of actin bundle positioning within the core cytoplasm 13 , 17 , 19 – 21 . Based on the distorted trichome phenotype of MYOSIN XI mutants 46 , acto - myosin - dependent organelle transport is a key com - ponent of growth control . Our time - lapse analyses of Golgi trans - port and actin bundle localization in wild - type trichomes did not detect an obviously organized ﬂ ow pattern , which is typical of tip - growing cells ; however , there was evidence for directional movement as a subset of Golgi staggered along actin bundle tracks ( Fig . 4i , Supplementary Fig . 4j and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Frequent pauses , bidirectional ﬂ ow along bundles with differing polarities , and exchange between the cortical and core cytoplasm ef ﬁ ciently circulated the Golgi throughout the branch as judged by projections of time - lapse images ( Fig . 4j ) . Large numbers of motile Golgi were present in young arpc2 branches ; however , the directionality of their movement was reduced ( Fig . 4l ) , and projections of time series images showed that Golgi motility was restricted to narrow traf ﬁ ck - ing lanes that were randomly positioned compared with the wild type ( Fig . 4k and Supplementary Fig . 4j ) . Defects in the actin cytos - keleton organization have been linked to wall thickness and cell shape defects in hypocotyl epidermal cells 34 . Given the cell wall thickness defects in arpc2 , ARP2 / 3 appears to operate at cellular scales by organizing an actin transport network that distributes secretory organelles throughout the cytoplasm so that wall assembly and growth are properly coupled . Certainly , additional levels of control at the plasma membrane , such as exocyst - dependent vesicle fusion 47 , enable the cell to more precisely balance the secretion of matrix components with cellulose synthesis during morphogenesis . ARP2 / 3 - generated apical actin meshworks may also have a more local function to position the MDZ during growth . We found that the size of the ARP2 / 3 - positive apical domain was strongly corre - lated with the tip geometry , and , based on two - colour live cell imaging , it was always positioned within the MDZ ( Fig . 4m , n ) . An importance for modulation of the size of the TIZ was also demonstrated with the ﬁ nite element model , because an improved ﬁ t with the experimental data was obtained when the regression lines from the MDZ and ARP2 / 3 localization data were used to couple the size of the TIZ and the radius of curvature during a simu - lation ( Fig . 4o and Supplementary Table 4 ) . ARP2 / 3 - mediated modulation of the TIZ is a plausible mechanism to achieve tip radius re ﬁ nement , because a perfect ﬁ t between the simulated and observed tip radius re ﬁ nement could be generated by optimizing the size of the TIZ throughout the simulation ( Fig . 4o ) . To conclude , the polarized growth and developmental responses of plant cells frequently involve subcellular heterogeneity in the mechanical properties of the cell wall 3 , 48 . In cell types such as devel - oping pavement cells 34 , 49 and tracheary elements 36 , non - overlapping actin - and microtubule - based cortical domains can direct the local assembly of specialized cell walls . A major challenge is to under - stand the complex interactions between cytoskeletal patterning , wall mechanics and cell shape change . In this paper , we discover new mechanisms by which an apical actin meshwork and the micro - tubule cytoskeleton cooperate to organize the cytoplasm to pattern the cell wall and shape change . A de ﬁ ned threshold of micro ﬁ bril alignment and a wall thickness gradient along the branch length were identi ﬁ ed as key parameters for polarized diffuse growth using a validated ﬁ nite element computational model . An ARP2 / 3 - generated actin meshwork in ﬂ uences wall thickness gradi - ents by positioning a network of core actin bundles that organize a bidirectional traf ﬁ cking system for distributed secretion . The thick - ness gradient introduces an apical bias to elongation and promotes rapid cell expansion . Tip re ﬁ nement is another critical feature during leaf trichome and cotton ﬁ bre 50 development , and we ﬁ nd this change is mediated by the geometry of an isotropic zone at the branch apex . ARP2 / 3 is activated within an apical MDZ with predicted isotropic cell wall character to mediate smooth tip re ﬁ nement during growth . It is possible that intracellular signalling and the polarization of cytoskeletal and membrane domains are suf ﬁ cient to control local wall properties during tip re ﬁ nement 36 . Alternatively , mechanical properties of the cell wall may feed back on intracellular pathways to coordinate events in the cytoplasm with the status of the extracellular matrix 34 . The W / SRC complex transmits activating ROP GTPase signals to ARP2 / 3 29 . Given the importance of ARP2 / 3 for the morphogenesis of nearlyall epidermal cell types , this work may serve as a general model to understand how nanometre - sized , actin ﬁ lament - nucleating machines can control intracellular organization and cell wall assembly at the micrometre scale of cells . Methods Plant materials , growth conditions , and trichome stage de ﬁ nitions . Arabidopsis ecotype Col - 0 was used as the wild type . The arpc5 / crk - 1 16 , arpc2 / dis2 - 1 33 and nap1 / grl - 6 45 alleles have been described previously . The plant materials for ﬂ uorescence imaging were grown on half - strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 1 % sucrose and 0 . 8 % Bacto agar under continuous illumination at 22°C . Re ﬂ ected light microscopy and TEM imaging employed soil - grown plants with continuous illumination at 22°C . For all experiments , young trichomes are de ﬁ ned as stage 4 trichomes having blunt tips and branch lengths less than 50 µm . Staging distorted mutant trichomes is complicated because the branches remain blunt and their ﬁ nal length is reduced . Time - lapse analyses of arpc2 trichomes showed that if the total cell height was less than 50 µm and branch length was less than 30 µm , the branches were likely to elongate . Therefore , all imaging and measurements of mutant branches utilized cells that fell at or below these size classes . Re ﬂ ected light microscopy . For time - lapse imaging of trichome growth using re ﬂ ected light microscopy , plants were imaged at either 3 days after germination ( DAG ) or 11 – 15DAG . White light from ametal halogen lamp was ﬁ ltered through a 525 / 50 ( Chroma ) band - pass ﬁ lter then directed to the sample using a 50 % transmissive beamsplitter ( Chroma ) , which allowed re ﬂ ected light to be directed to the detector . Images were collected using a 50× LU - Apo 0 . 55 numerical aperture ( NA ) long working distance objective lens and a Coolsnap HQ camera ( Photometrics ) mounted on a Nikon 80i microscope . Stacks were captured at 5 , 10 ARTICLES NATURE PLANTS DOI : 10 . 1038 / NPLANTS . 2015 . 14 NATURE PLANTS | VOL 1 | MARCH 2015 | www . nature . com / natureplants 6 © 201 5 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . or 15 min intervals using a z - step size of 0 . 5 µm . Images of mature trichome tips for the wild type and arpc2 mutant were captured under bright - ﬁ eld illumination using a 60× PlanApo 1 . 2 NAwater objective lens . Devices were controlled using Slidebook software version 5 . 5 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) . Bead labelling and ﬂ uorescence microscopy . Deep red ﬂ uorescent polystyrene beads ( 0 . 17 µm ; Molecular Probes ) were applied to newly emerged leaves of 10 – 13 DAG seedlings . The seedlings were air dried for 1 h and gently rinsed with water to remove unbound beads before mounting . A whole seedling with agar containing growth media was transferred to our homemade gas - permeable chamber , which was constructed using a microscope slide and a cover slip with 2 . 5 mm silicon isolator ( JRT - SA2 - 2 . 5 , Grace Bio - Labs ) between them . The rare stage 4 trichomes between 15 and 34 µm in length with high and uniform bead coverage were selected for further analysis . In chambered slides , the branch elongation rates varied from 1 . 7 to 3 . 4 µm h – 1 , and were similar to those observed for soil grown plants . For detailed information on all other ﬂ uorescent probes and the con ﬁ guration of the spinning disc imaging platform please refer to the Supplementary Information . Finite element modelling . The ﬁ nite element model of a trichome branch was created using Abaqus 6 . 11 . The trichome branch was modelled as an axisymmetric shell reservoir under constant hydrostatic pressure representing turgor pressure ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Effects of material and thickness gradients were studied by subdividing the shell longitudinally ( from the tip to the base ) into several sections . The in ﬂ uence of tip isotropy on tip re ﬁ nement was investigated by creating isotropic regions of variable size near the branch tip , namely the TIZ . A speci ﬁ c hyperelastic anisotropic constitutive material model was chosen 24 because of its relevance to a ﬁ bre - reinforced plant cell wall . The effect of the model parameters on overall growth shape of the trichome branch was studied to understand their speci ﬁ c in ﬂ uence on growth behaviour . A standard linear solid ( SLS ) viscoelastic material was assumed to represent the time - dependent ( viscoelastic ) behaviour of the wall with initial values taken from pavement cell measurements 51 . Growth was modelled as a sequence of several steps : expanding the branch cell wall due to turgor pressure , using this deformed geometry into the next simulation run , rede ﬁ ning sections and resetting initial thicknesses values representing synthesis of new material ( similar to previous work 4 for polar growth of pollen tubes ) . Each loading step ( de ﬁ ned as one “ growth cycle ” ) concluded when the wall was fully relaxed and 30 – 100 growth cycles were needed to achieve ﬁ nal trichome lengths representative of experiments . Optimization of the TIZ size ( an adaptive technique ) was performed until it was within 2 % of the experimental tip radius of curvature ( 3 – 6 repetitions were needed for convergence ) . Several methods were developed to connect the simulation results with the experiments to determine the model parameters .
