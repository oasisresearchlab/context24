Accessibility ARTICLE Solar geoengineering and the chemtrails conspiracy on social media Dustin Tingley 1 & Gernot Wagner 2 ABSTRACT Discourse on social media of solar geoengineering has been rapidly increasing over the past decade , in line with increased attention by the scienti ﬁ c community and low but increasing awareness among the general public . The topic has also found increased attention online . But unlike scienti ﬁ c discourse , a majority of online discussion focuses on the so - called chemtrails conspiracy theory , the widely debunked idea that airplanes are spraying a toxic mix of chemicals through contrails , with supposed goals ranging from weather to mind control . This paper presents the results of a nationally representative 1000 - subject poll part of the 36 , 000 - subject 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study ( CCES ) , and an ana - lysis of the universe of social media mentions of geoengineering . The former shows ~ 10 % of Americans declaring the chemtrails conspiracy as “ completely ” and a further ~ 20 – 30 % as “ somewhat ” true , with no apparent difference by party af ﬁ liation or strength of partisanship . Conspiratorial views have accounted for ~ 60 % of geoengineering discourse on social media over the past decade . Of that , Twitter has accounted for > 90 % , compared to ~ 75 % of total geoengineering mentions . Further af ﬁ nity analysis reveals a broad online community of conspiracy . Anonymity of social media appears to help its spread , so does the general ease of spreading unveri ﬁ ed or outright false information . Online behavior has important real - world reverberations , with implications for climate science communication and policy .

The scheme has been going on for years , perhaps decades ( Thomas , 1999 ) . The goal : everything from large - scale weather modi ﬁ cation to mass population or mind control . The motive presumably would vary with the goal , but it is typically seen as a version of powerful business , gov - ernment , and military interests covering up even worse deeds . Except none of this is true . “ Chemtrails ” are not real . The US Environmental Protection Agency says so ( EPA , 2000 ) . Scientists say so ( Cairns , 2016 ; Shearer et al . , 2016 ) . An increasing number of investigative journalistic accounts say so ( e . g . , Dunne , 2017 ; Streep , 2008 ) . Contrails , made up of water vapor , have been a byproduct of aviation ever since humans began to ﬂ y using jet engines ( Pretor - Pinney and Sanderson , 2006 ) . An online essay ( Thomas , 1999 ) might have been the ﬁ rst piece of writing connecting contrails to chemical spraying , even if it did not use the term “ chemtrails ” . Thomas ( 1999 ) references a 1996 Air Force paper on proposals to engage in weather modi ﬁ cation ( House et al . , 1996 ) . Together with the High frequency Active Auroral Research Program ( HAARP ) , House et al . ( 1996 ) helped fuel speculation of military links among conspiracy theorists ( Newitz and Steiner , 2014 ; Streep , 2008 ) , leading to online commentary under titles like : “ Military Industrial Complex Takes Charge , Blasts Skies With Chemtrails ” . Meanwhile , the chemtrails conspiracy is no longer small . Per Public Policy Polling ( 2013 ) , 5 % of US respondents subscribed to the chemtrails conspiracy theory in 2013 , next to a number of other conspiracies . Mercer et al . ( 2011 ) ﬁ nds 2 . 6 % “ completely ” and 14 % “ partly ” believed in the conspiracy in 2010 . Our representative pre - election survey of US adults conducted in October – November 2016 as part of the Cooperative Congres - sional Election Study ( CCES ) , shows around 10 % describe the chemtrails conspiracy as “ completely true ” ( Table 1 , see Methods below ) . Roughly a further 20 to 30 % describe it as “ somewhat true ” . Belief in the conspiracy spans the political spectrum , with no signi ﬁ cant difference on either the left or right , or by strength in ideological af ﬁ liation ( Fig . 1 ) . The slightly higher belief in the chemtrails conspiracy among independents than among those on either side of the ideological spectrum is not statistically signi ﬁ cant . Both the sentiments expressed in the wider geoengineering discourse online and the chemtrails conspiracy demonstrate the importance of “ echo chambers ” ( Vicario et al . , 2016 ) created by social media in what amounts to a broad ‘ community of con - spiracy ’ . It also has potentially important linkages to wider poli - tical forces ( Gainous and Wagner , 2014 ) . While conspiracy theories have had a long history in US popular imagination and politics ( Andersen , 2017 ; Barkun , 2013 , Sunstein and Vermeule , 2009 ) , the rise and election of President Donald Trump , in par - ticular , has pulled discussion of conspiracy theories into the mainstream , with varying implications ( Goertzel , 1994 ; Sunstein and Vermeule , 2009 ) . While the CCES numbers show no corre - lation with extreme partisan political views ( Fig . 1 ) , our sub - sequent analysis of online social media discourse reveals how those propagating the chemtrails conspiracy theory online also engage in various other forms of extremist and conspiratorial discussions , ranging from af ﬁ nities toward the views of Alex Jones on the one hand and toward terms like “ Wikileaks ” and “ Benghazi ” on the other . Meanwhile , representative tweets around the time of Trump ’ s election in November 2016 showed that some conspirators considered Trump ’ s election an opportunity to “ expose ” the chemtrails conspiracy , though opi - nions soon shifted , leading to online commentary such as : “ Trump Admin to Increase Atmospheric Geoengineering Efforts , Spray Chemtrails for Next 100 Years Straight ” . 1 Methods US public opinion . Table 1 and Fig . 1 presented above are based on survey data collected via the CCES of the US electorate , which was conducted in October and November 2016 by YouGov / Polimetrix ( YP ) . Administered online , it gathered a nationally strati ﬁ ed sample of more than 36 , 000 respondents . The “ chemtrails ” question was part of one of eighteen additional 1 , 000 - subject pre - election studies . It came at the end of a 20 - minute survey , with the latter 10min focused on solar geoengineering . 2 Prior questions , thus , increased familiarity with solar geoengi - neering beyond the general public . Mahajan et al . ( 2017 ) analyzes the CCES results more broadly and provides information on general attitudes toward solar geoen - gineering use and research . Online social media discourse . We use the social media analysis platform Crimson Hexagon to analyze the totality of English tweets for the decade from May 2008 through May 2017 , in addition to mentions in public posts on Facebook , YouTube , Google Plus , Tumblr , and other blogs , online forums , reviews , com - ments , and news items . Twitter comprises the majority ( 77 % ) of the over 5 million relevant English posts , far ahead of Tumblr ( 4 % ) , Facebook ( 3 % ) , YouTube ( 3 % ) , and Google Plus ( < 1 % ) . Crimson Hexagon employs both a supervised learning Table 1 Cooperative Congressional Election Study ( CCES ) survey , fall 2016 : “ Do you believe it is true that the government has a secret program that uses airplanes to put harmful chemicals into the air ( often called “ chemtrails ” ) ? ” Percentage Percentage , including “ best guess ” follow - up question Completely false 32 % 34 % Somewhat false 15 % 27 % Somewhat true 19 % 29 % Completely true 9 % 10 % Unsure 25 % n / a 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 E x t r e m e D e m o c r a t M od e r a t e D e m o c r a t I nd e p e nd e n t M od e r a t e R e pub li ca n E x t r e m e R e pub li ca n U n s u r e Partisanship P r opo r ti on o f p a r t y w ho a r e c h e m t r a il b e li e v e r s Fig . 1 Belief among US public in “ chemtrails ” conspiracy by self - identi ﬁ ed political leaning . Results of 1000 - subject CCES pre - election poll , October and November 2016 ARTICLE PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 017 - 0014 - 3 2 PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS | 3 : 12 | DOI : 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 017 - 0014 - 3 | www . nature . com / palcomms method ( Hopkins and King , 2010 ) and automated sentiment analysis of relevant online discourse on geoengineering . “ Relevant ” posts include all public English posts mentioning at least one of eleven terms : “ climate engineering ” and “ geoengineering ” broadly ; “ solar geoengineering , ” “ solar radiation management ” and its prominent abbreviation “ SRM ” , and “ albedo modi ﬁ cation ” more speci ﬁ cally ; “ stratospheric aerosol injection ” , “ marine cloud brightening ” , and “ cirrus cloud thinning ” as the three most promising and most commonly discussed methodologies ; and , lastly , “ chemtrails ” and “ HAARP ” to zero in on the most commonly used terms in conjunction with the chemtrails conspiracy theory . We did not explicitly include word fragments or common misspellings , as Crimson Hexagon ’ s ‘ guided ’ categorization algorithm accounts for partial word mentions and detects misspellings . Crimson Hexagon ’ s most signi ﬁ cant advantage is its ‘‘ guided ’’ but otherwise automatic categorization of public posts into pre - determined categories ( Hopkins and King , 2010 ) . We chose ﬁ ve such categories , training the algorithm to categorize posts found via the eleven search terms into one of ﬁ ve groups : neutral science reporting ( “ neutral ” ) ; posts emphasizing unintended consequences and otherwise portraying geoengineering in a negative light without being conspiratorial ( “ negative ” ) ; posts emphasizing the potential positive impact and otherwise portraying geoengineering in a positive light ( “ positive ” ) ; posts espousing or otherwise helping to spread the chemtrails conspiracy ( “ chemtrails ” ) ; and off - topic posts , despite their mentioning one of the eleven keywords ( “ off - topic ” ) . We trained posts to each category that had any presence in the data , and then used the built - in ReadMe algorithm to estimate the population proportions belonging to each category on the universe of posts ﬁ tting the keyword criterion . A limitation of Crimson Hexagon ’ s Facebook data is the exclusive focus on public posts , missing “ echo chambers ” ( Vicario et al . , 2016 ) created in private online conversations among Facebook ‘ friends ’ . On Twitter , Crimson Hexagon attempts to ﬁ lter out bots , though some may well be included in the ﬁ nal analysis . The sentiment analysis presented below takes advantage of Crimson Hexagon ’ s automated sentiment analysis , capturing “ positive , ” “ negative , ” and “ neutral ” attitudes toward a particular topic . The algorithm is able to pick up on sentiments conveyed in a post to categorize them , going well beyond mere keyword searches . For example , a tweet on 16 August 2016 , saying “ Expert consensus : Chemtrails aren ’ t actually a thing ” is correctly categorized as science reporting , while a tweet saying “ # Chemtrails Caldeira comes clean on chemtrails ” is correctly categorized as chemtrails conspiracy . Some others are dif ﬁ cult to judge . For example , Crimson Hexagon categorizes a tweet saying “ # Cloudseeding long - term , would negatively impact ecosystems left thirsty ” as negative portrayal . Further inspection could also indicate it should be in the chemtrails conspiracy category , though either category might ﬁ t . Examples of off - topic mentions include tweets that use “ SRM ” in an entirely different context , for example , as abbreviation for “ supplier relationship management ” . Crimson Hexagon categorizes those correctly as off - topic . Findings . The vast majority of social media posts falls into the chemtrails con - spiracy camp ( 61 % ) , neutral science reporting is in the clear minority ( 6 % ) , slightly trumped by negative portrayal ( 8 % ) , with 25 % of posts being off - topic . Positive portrayal barely registered at < 1 % ( Fig . 2 ) . Automated sentiment analysis classi ﬁ es social media mentions of geoengineering into positive , negative , and neutral categories . Figure 3 shows all social media mentions of geoengineering and assorted search terms by month from May 2008 through May 2017 , including mentions of chemtrails . Figure 4 excludes chemtrails mentions . Both ﬁ gures reveal a general upward trend , heavily in ﬂ uenced by single events . January 2015 saw the publication of the US National Academy of Science ’ s comprehensive set of reports on carbon and solar geoengineering ( NRC , 2015a , b ) , leading to a spike of online discourse with and without the conspiracy theory . Similarly , the spike in April and May 2017 can be linked to the formal launch of Harvard ’ s Solar Geoengineering Research Program and associated media mentions ( e . g . , Gertner , 2017 ; Green ﬁ eldboyce , 2017 ; Porter , 2017 ) . 3 The proportion of non - chemtrails conspiracy social media mentions from May 2008 through May 2017 ( Fig . 4 ) among total mentions ( Fig . 3 ) shows no discernible trend . The ratio ranges from 18 % , in March 2011 , to 70 % , in September Fig . 2 Monthly geoengineering monitor categories on Twitter , Facebook and other social media platforms , May 2008 – 17 , using Crimson Hexagon ’ s supervised learning methods ( Hopkins and King , 2010 ) to categorize social media discourse as “ chemtrails ” ( 61 % of total ) , ” negative ” ( 8 % ) , “ neutral ” science reporting ( 6 % ) , “ positive ” ( < 1 % ) , and off - topic ( 25 % ) Fig . 3 Monthly basic geoengineering sentiment trend on Twitter , Facebook and other social media platforms , May 2008 – 17 , using Crimson Hexagon ’ s automated sentiment analysis PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 017 - 0014 - 3 ARTICLE PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS | 3 : 12 | DOI : 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 017 - 0014 - 3 | www . nature . com / palcomms 3 2009 , with an absolute - value t - statistic of 0 . 61 when testing the H 0 of whether the slope of the trend line was statistically signi ﬁ cantly different from zero . It is not . The chemtrails conspiracy appears to grow hand - in - hand with the general increase in social media discourse around geoengineering . We compare the results between all geoengineering - focused posts ( Fig . 3 ) to those without chemtrails ( Fig . 4 ) instead of focusing on a chemtrails - only monitor ( Fig . 5 ) . The latter would skew results , as it excludes geoengineering posts not mentioning “ chemtrails ” that Crimson Hexagon ’ s learning mechanism subsequently classi ﬁ es as pertaining to the conspiracy . It also captures too many posts that would be “ off - topic ” or “ neutral ” science reporting despite mentioning the term “ chemtrails . ” While Fig . 5 shows some of the same overall trends — e . g . , the spike in posts in May 2015 — the total numbers do not conform to the difference between all solar geoengineering - focuses posts ( Fig . 3 ) and those without chemtrails ( Fig . 4 ) . Basic “ positive ” and “ negative ” sentiments , meanwhile , have shifted signi ﬁ cantly . Among all social media mentions including “ chemtrails ” ( Fig . 3 ) , around 33 % of tweets displayed a “ negative ” sentiment during the ﬁ rst 12 months of our analysis spanning mid - 2008 to 2009 , declining to 18 % for the ﬁ nal 12 months from mid - 2016 to 2017 . That re ﬂ ects a statistically signi ﬁ cant decrease of 1 . 7 % per year ( t - statistic = 11 . 5 ) . During the same time period , overall positive sentiment shows no signi ﬁ cant trend , staying near - constant at 9 . 4 % throughout ( t - statistic = 0 . 92 ) . Excluding tweets categorized as propagating the chemtrails conspiracy ( Fig . 4 ) , those classi ﬁ ed by Crimson Hexagon ’ s automated sentiment analysis to have positive sentiment decreased slightly from 10 . 4 to 8 . 1 % over the course of the decade , while those displaying negative sentiment decreased signi ﬁ cantly from 30 . 9 % to 13 . 0 % ( t - statistics = 3 . 8 and 9 . 4 , respectively ) . Note that this only re ﬂ ects relative sentiment and does not in itself convey greater acceptance of solar geoengineering over the course of the past decade . It does imply that online discourse on solar geoengineering more broadly happens in emotionally more neutral ways , despite the absolute dominance of the chemtrails conspiracy . Discussion What can explain the apparent spread of the chemtrails conspiracy ? Per the CCES results , chemtrails conspirators are not con ﬁ ned to generally extreme political beliefs . Neither “ extreme ” Democrats or Republicans are more likely to subscribe to the conspiracy theory than “ moderate ” ones ( Fig . 1 ) . However , further detailed analysis of online behavior reveals an af ﬁ nity of those tweeting about geoengi - neering toward other topics that could be grouped into more partisan extremist causes . Table 2 shows the top 25 keywords with the highest ratio between those captured by the overall geoengineering monitor vs . all of Twitter . A sense of a community of conspiracy quickly emerges . The list features some expected general terms like “ climate ” , “ climate change ” , and “ sustainability ” but otherwise primarily focuses on topics associated with partisan politics . Those include keywords most associated with liberal concern , such as genetically modi ﬁ ed organisms ( GMOs ) in the form of “ Monsanto ” , and topics typically associated with conservative politics both in the United States and abroad . Some keywords are dif ﬁ cult to categorize , including “ Msnbc ” and “ Fox News ” , as we do not know the attitudes displayed toward those terms . Others are more clearly associated with fringe and outright conspiratorial positions . Those include Sen . Ron Paul ( Republican , Texas ) , whose name is often invoked by chemtrails conspirators as offering ‘‘ support ’’ for their views , right - wing radio personality and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , the term “ Talk radio ” itself , and terms like “ Wikileaks ” , “ Affordable Care Act ” , “ Liberty ” , “ Tea Party ” , and “ Con - stitution ” . The 26th term not featured in Table 2 : “ Benghazi ” . 4 Note that Table 2 captures af ﬁ nities across the entire “ geoengineering ” monitor , not just “ chemtrails ” alone . 5 Despite limitations of the latter , a “ chemtrails ” - only af ﬁ nity analysis mirrors that of the broader geoengineering monitor and reveals a similar community of conspiracy ( Table 3 ) . The relative anonymity afforded by Twitter and other online platforms may also play a key role in the spread of conspiracy theories . There are many other dif - ferences across social media platforms , though Twitter has indeed become known for having a preponderance of anonymous ‘‘ bots ’’ ( Varol et al . , 2017 ) . Even though Fig . 4 Monthly basic geoengineering sentiment trend excluding mentions of the chemtrails conspiracy on Twitter , Facebook , and other social media platforms , May 2008 – 17 , using Crimson Hexagon ’ s automated sentiment analysis Fig . 5 Monthly basic geoengineering sentiment trend focused only on chemtrails conspiracy only on Twitter , Facebook , and other social media platforms , May 2008 – 17 , using Crimson Hexagon ’ s automated sentiment analysis ARTICLE PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 017 - 0014 - 3 4 PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS | 3 : 12 | DOI : 10 . 1057 / s41599 - 017 - 0014 - 3 | www . nature . com / palcomms Crimson Hexagon ﬁ lters out bots , the general sense remains that Twitter affords its users more anonymity than other platforms , if desired by the user . Table 4 shows the fraction of a representative sample of ~ 10 , 000 social media mentions over the full ten - year period by category and platform . Well over half of tweets are categorized as “ chemtrails ” . Only 21 % of ( public ) Facebook posts and 13 % of all other social media posts are in that category . The difference across platforms is highly statistically signi ﬁ cant ( χ 2 = 2711 ) . 6 It is clear a much higher fraction of tweets fall into the chemtrails conspiracy camp than do public Facebook posts or those on other online platforms . The gap between online discourse and popular belief on the one hand and the attention paid to it by scientists on the other is large . An overwhelming majority of scientists dismiss the conspiracy as just that ( Shearer et al . , 2016 ) . Yet the real - world importance of social media cannot be dismissed . That goes for the Arab Spring ( Jamal et al . , 2015 ; Wagner and Gainous , 2013 ) as well as for US politics ( Gainous and Wagner , 2014 ) . The conspiracy similarly has important implications for global governance of solar geoengineering ( Cairns , 2016 ) . Ignoring the chemtrails conspiracy may well have been a viable option at a time when perhaps ~ 5 or even ~ 15 % of the general public subscribed to it . Now that the numbers appear to be closer to between ~ 30 and ~ 40 % of the US public ( Table 1 ) , that may no longer be a viable option . As the 2016 US presidential election has shown , “ fake news ” can have real impacts ( Allcott and Gentzkow , 2017 ) . How then to attempt to address the topic ? While there is a long history of thought on the topic ( e . g . , Meyer , 2010 ) , the practice of science communication is often more art than science . Climate science communication already raises dif ﬁ cult questions , in part linked to deeper moti - vations and interests among a host of stakeholders ( e . g . , Oreskes and Conway , 2010 ) . The very characteristics that make climate change such a dif ﬁ cult public policy problem ( e . g . , Wagner and Zeckhauser , 2011 ) complicate addressing the chemtrails conspiracy further . While the US public ’ s con ﬁ dence in leaders of the scienti ﬁ c community writ large has been relatively stable since the 1970s ( Rainie , 2017 ) , the spread of the chemtrails conspiracy not least re ﬂ ects a general distrust in science as an institution and in science communicators more broadly ( Cairns , 2016 ; Lewandowsky et al . , 2013 ) . One important question is whether scienti ﬁ c attention to the conspiracy theory helps spread it further . Some chemtrails conspirators take the increased number of articles on the subject itself as evidence that there must be something to their theory . This mirrors what we can observe with those arguing against vaccinating children , often for unwarranted fears of a link between vaccinations and autism ( Doja and Roberts , 2006 ; Miller and Reynolds , 2009 ) . Much like ‘ anti - vaxxers ’ are hardly persuaded by evidence against their theory , chemtrails conspirators , too , are apparent masters in picking ‘ evidence ’ to support their views , while ignoring evi - dence against them . Regardless of possible unintended consequences , ﬁ ghting tweets with peer - reviewed analyses does not work . Much more promising are attempts to engage at the same level , speaking to chemtrails conspirators directly using social media platforms ( e . g . West , 2014 ) . Conclusion Chemtrails are not real . Belief in the chemtrails conspiracy is . Between ~ 30 and ~ 40 % of the general US public appear to subscribe to versions of the conspiracy theory , numbers only topped by the large fraction ( ~ 60 % ) of social media dis - course , more on Twitter , focused on the topic . That renders rational conversations around solar geoengineering and its potential role in climate policy even more dif ﬁ cult than it would be absent the chemtrails conspiracy ( Burns et al . , 2016 ) . It also shows some of the broader implications of this online community of con - spiracy with implications well beyond climate policy .

Similarly instructive is a basic search for YouTube clips mentioning “ chemtrails ” . 2 The ﬁ rst 10min of “ common content ” gathered commonly used political and demographic information . 3 Media around the launch also resulted in a link , albeit tenuous , to the election of President Trump . See Keith and Wagner ( 2017 ) in response to Neslen ( 2017 ) and Lukacs ( 2017 ) , followed by a large number of online commentaries and social media discussions captured by our analysis , Figs . 3 – 4 . 4 The speci ﬁ c terms change somewhat over time . For example , an af ﬁ nity table for June 2015 – 16 includes the terms “ Fukushima ” and “ Al Gore ” , whereas an analysis con ﬁ ned to January through June 2017 features “ Benghazi ” more highly and does not include either “ Tea Party ” or “ Talk Radio ” . The overall trends , however , are relatively stable . Keywords featured regardless of which time period is analyzed over the past ﬁ ve years include : “ Climate ” , “ climate change ” , “ Affordable Care Act ” , “ Monsanto ” , “ Fox News ” , “ Alex Jones ” , “ Ron Paul ” , “ British National Party ” , and “ Liberty ” . 5 See our prior discussion of the limitations of a “ chemtrails ” - only monitor . 6 Simplifying the table to only capture “ chemtrails ” vs . “ not chemtrails ” across platforms still results in χ 2 = 1415 . Only looking at Twitter versus Facebook results in χ 2 = 197 , still indicating a rejection of H 0 hypothesizing equal fractions across platform well beyond the 0 . 1 % signi ﬁ cance level .
