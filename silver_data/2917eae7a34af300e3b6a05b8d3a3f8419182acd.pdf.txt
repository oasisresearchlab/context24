Transmembrane receptors of the integrin family mediate ECM attachment and play important roles in sensing and responding to ECM properties . Integrin signaling involves large integrin - associated intracellular protein complexes that act as anchors for the cytoskeleton and as signaling hotspots where enzymes and substrates are concentrated . Moreover , many different growth factor signaling cascades are ampliﬁed when cells are attached to the ECM . Integrins are involved in many pathologies ; here we focus on their roles in cancer . Although “anchorage - independence” is a hallmark of cancer cells , genetic studies clearly show that integrins and associated proteins provide essential support for early tumor development and growth . Integrins also provide support during later stages of tumor progression but in some scenarios they appear to have suppressive activity , which is currently not understood . © 2013 Elsevier Ltd .

Signaling network facts • Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that bind ECM and cluster in “cell matrix adhesions” where they assemble large multiprotein complexes including actin - binding proteins . • Integrins probe the physical properties of the ECM and through a series of conformational changes in mechanoresponsive proteins within adhesions provide mechanical coupling between the ECM and the cytoskeletal network . • Cell - matrix adhesions contain enzymes such as focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , Src , Rac , and many others as well their upstream regulators and downstream effectors thereby locally activating a variety of cellular signaling cascades . • Signaling through receptors for EGF , IGF , PDGF , VEGF , and other growth factors is ampliﬁed , often through Src family kinase - mediated cross - phosphorylation , upon ECM attachment . • The ability of integrins to control cellular shape and cytoarchi - tecture in response to extracellular forces as well as their role in a variety of signal transduction cascades underlies their critical function in growth signaling and cell migration / invasion strate - gies . ∗ Corresponding author at : Department of Toxicology , LACDR , Leiden University , Einsteinweg 55 , 2333CC Leiden , The Netherlands .

Introduction Cells interact with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) through various adhesion receptors , including integrins . Integrins are het - erodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors that bind with their globular head domain to speciﬁc peptide motifs in ECM proteins and connect through their very short cytoplasmic tails with a num - ber of cytoskeletal adapters and signaling molecules ( Hynes , 2002 ) . The (cid:2) 1 and the (cid:3) v integrin subfamilies encompass integrins that bind ECM ligands containing the Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) motif such as ﬁbronectin and vitronectin . In addition , the (cid:2) 1 subfamily com - prises various laminin and collagen receptors . Altogether , these integrins allow cells to adhere to a variety of ECM structures includ - ing laminin - rich basement membranes , ﬁbrillar collagen structures and provisional ﬁbronectin - containing matrices associated with wound healing and enriched during angiogenesis and cancer pro - gression . 2 . Functions , cascades , and key molecules 2 . 1 . Stimulation of cell survival Most cell types depend on integrin - mediated cell adhesion to ECM for survival and proliferation ( Fig . 1 ) . This is especially true for endothelial and epithelial cells that rapidly undergo apopto - sis when adhesion is disturbed . Integrin - mediated cell adhesion stimulates PI3K - mediated PKB / AKT activity ( Frisch and Screaton , 2001 ) . One of the important cell - matrix adhesion constituents that play an important role in integrin - mediated survival signaling is FAK . Recently , it has been found that FAK can enter the nucleus , 1357 - 2725 / $ – see front matter © 2013 Elsevier Ltd .

Xiong et al . / The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology 45 ( 2013 ) 1012 – 1015 1013 Fig . 1 . Integrin - mediated effects on survival and proliferation signaling . Integrin - mediated adhesion leads to clustering of enzymes and substrates and transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) thereby augmenting growth factor signaling . In addition , cell - matrix adhesions act as sites where physical properties of ECM are coupled to cytoskeletal organization , which is connected to nuclear shape . Together , these aspects of “integrin signaling” affect ( cancer ) cell survival and proliferation . bind p53 , and inhibit p53 - mediated transcription providing a direct link between integrin signaling complexes and transcriptional reg - ulation of cell survival ( Lim et al . , 2008 ) . 2 . 2 . Stimulation of cell proliferation A major checkpoint in the cell cycle is the transition from G1 to S phase . Here , environmental cues drive cyclin / Cdk activities that culminate in phosphorylation of the Rb tumor suppres - sor , which acts as a restriction point for entry in the S phase . Besides strict dependency on the appropriate growth factors , progression through the G1 phase is tightly controlled by cell adhe - sion ( Danen et al . , 2000 ) . Also in integrin - mediated proliferation signaling , FAK plays an important role : the ability of integrin - mediated adhesion to support cell cycle progression was recently reported to require talin - mediated FAK activation ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) . 2 . 3 . Force transmission in survival and proliferation signaling Integrins and several associated cell - matrix adhesion proteins undergo conformational changes in response to force . In this man - ner , mechanical coupling between ECM and the cytoskeleton is ensured ( Friedland et al . , 2009 ; Moore et al . , 2010 ) . Through cytoskeletal linkage between cell - matrix adhesions and the nuclear envelope or through force - dependent activation of signaling com - plexes this controls cell survival and proliferation ( Mammoto and Ingber , 2009 ) . One example of a force - dependent growth - signaling cascade involves FAK : on rigid but not soft ECM substrates FAK is activated causing Rac - mediated cyclin D1 gene induc - tion , and cyclin D1 - dependent Rb phosphorylation ( Klein et al . , 2009 ) . 3 . Associated pathologies and therapeutic implications – focus on cancer 3 . 1 . Control of cancer growth and progression Given their fundamental roles in survival , proliferation , and dif - ferentiation of cells , it is not surprising that integrins have been implicated in numerous pathologies . Integrins can play positive as well as negative roles in cancer . For instance , increased expression of (cid:3) v integrins contributes to primary tumor growth and invasion in human melanoma ( Felding - Habermann et al . , 1992 ) . Conversely , the tumor suppressor p16INK4a transcriptionally stimulates (cid:3) 5 (cid:2) 1 expression thereby conferring sensitivity to apoptosis in absence of proper adhesion ( Plath et al . , 2000 ) . However , others have shown that point mutants of p53 that are associated with tumor pro - gression promote enhanced (cid:3) 5 (cid:2) 1 integrin recycling , which drives invasion ( Muller et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , regulation of integrin (cid:3) 5 (cid:2) 1 by distinct tumor suppressors has been implicated in processes inter - fering with – as well as those supporting tumor progression . One important mode of regulation of cancer growth and progression that is controlled by (cid:3) v (cid:2) 6 and other RGD - binding integrins is acti - vation of TGF (cid:2) and TGF (cid:2) R signaling . Since TGF (cid:2) plays a dual role in carcinoma development and progression and its function in tumor cells versus its role in stromal cells is different , the outcome of such integrin - TGF (cid:2) cross talk is complex ( Margadant and Sonnenberg , 2010 ) . The ability of integrins to mediate tensional homeostasis may be important in cancer . For instance , altered activities of Rho GTPases in cancer cells leading to increased cytoskeletal contractility may exert forces on ECM through integrins , resulting in environmental stiffening . Vice versa , a stiffer ECM exerts forces on the cytoskeletal network through integrins . This drives a feed forward loop produc - ing increased tension , which has been suggested to act as a driving force in cancer progression ( Levental et al . , 2009 ) . On the other hand , high levels of FAK activity found in metastatic colon cancer cells disrupt the normal mechano - responsiveness , which may ren - der such cells independent from ECM - derived forces and thereby support metastasis ( von Wichert et al . , 2008 ) . Studies using ( conditional ) genetic models point to critical roles for (cid:2) 1 integrins in initiation , growth , or progression of a vari - ety of cancers ( Table 1 ) . Their role is often stimulatory but recent work suggests that (cid:2) 1 integrins may also suppress tumor progres - sion . In a prostate adenocarcinoma model , deletion of (cid:2) 1 integrins led to more dramatic expansion of the tumor cell population , enhanced the rate of prostate tumor progression , and decreased overall animal survival ( Moran - Jones et al . , 2012 ) . Similarly , ErbB2 - induced mammary tumor progression was accelerated when (cid:3) 2 (cid:2) 1 was deleted with increased intravasation and increased metasta - sis ( Ramirez et al . , 2011 ) . The apparent suppressor activity that is conferred by integrins in these studies is not understood . Finally , genetic evidence that (cid:2) 1 integrin - associated signal transducers are involved in cancer is largely limited to FAK in skin and breast cancer ( Table 1 ) . 1014 J .

Integrin signaling as a therapeutic target in cancer Expression of (cid:3) v integrins , in particular (cid:3) v (cid:2) 3 supports tumor growth , angiogenesis , and metastasis in xenograft mouse mod - els for melanoma and breast cancer ( Brooks et al . , 1995 ; Felding - Habermann et al . , 1992 ) . On this basis , antibodies and RGD - based strategies to block (cid:3) v integrins were developed for clinical trials . However , more recent evidence showing that (cid:3) v integrin deletion in the host can enhance angiogenesis and growth of transplanted tumors and that treatment with low concentrations of RGD leads to enhanced tumor growth , clearly warrant caution ( Reynolds et al . , 2009 ) . Targeting integrins may prove effective in combination with existing strategies . For instance , interfering with integrin - mediated adhesion can enhance sensitivity of solid tumors to radiotherapy in 3 - dimensional cultures and mice ( Eke et al . , 2012 ; Nam et al . , 2010 ) . 4 . Concluding remarks Increasing evidence supports the idea that (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 3 integrins have cancer - promoting effects , making them potential therapeu - tic targets – especially in a combined setting with radio - or chemotherapy . There are also indication that in breast and prostate carcinoma (cid:2) 1 integrin - blocking strategies might have undesired effects leading to enhanced metastasis formation . Moreover , inhibi - tion of apparent suppressor functions of (cid:3) v - integrins in stromal or endothelial cells may contribute to growth and invasion of certain cancers . It is currently unknown which different integrin signaling pathways explain their pivotal role in cancer growth and progres - sion . Nevertheless , gene deletion suggests that targeting one player in integrin signaling , FAK may be a promising strategy in the case of breast , and perhaps other cancers . Ultimately , a better under - standing of the role of all the different integrin subfamilies as well as components of the integrin signaling machinery in tumor growth and progression is needed to develop more accurate ther - apies .
