World Health Organization disease burden estimates place Chagas’ disease ﬁrst among parasitic diseases in the Americas , accounting for nearly 5 times as many dis - ability - adjusted life years lost as malaria ( 343 ) . An estimated 8 million people are currently infected , and 20 to 30 % of these will develop symptomatic , potentially life - threatening Chagas’ disease ( Table 1 ) ( 214 ) . T . cruzi is carried in the guts of hema - tophagous triatomine bugs ; transmission occurs when infected bug feces contaminate the bite site or intact mucous mem - branes . T . cruzi can also be transmitted through transfusion , through transplant , and congenitally ( 177 , 234 ) . Historically , transmission and morbidity were concentrated in rural areas of Latin America where poor housing conditions favor vector infestation . However , in the last several decades , successful vector control programs have substantially de - creased transmission in rural areas , and migration has brought infected individuals to cities both within and outside Latin America ( 87 , 111 , 196 ) . Since 1991 , several subregional initia - tives have made major advances in decreasing vector infesta - tion in human dwellings and extending screening of the blood supply for T . cruzi ( 87 , 269 ) . In 2007 , control efforts in Latin America were formally joined by an initiative to address the “globalization” of Chagas’ disease , recognizing the increasing presence of imported cases in Europe , North America , and Japan and the potential for local transmission through nonvec - torial routes ( 344 ) . The United States occupies an ambiguous position in this new initiative . While the United States has never participated in Latin American Chagas’ disease control programs , it cannot be classiﬁed as an area where the disease is “not endemic” in the same sense as Europe or Japan . The southern tier of states from Georgia to California contains established enzootic cycles of T . cruzi , involving several triato - mine vector species and mammalian hosts such as raccoons , opossums , and domestic dogs ( 26 , 151 , 345 ) . Nevertheless , most T . cruzi - infected individuals in the United States are immigrants from areas of endemicity in Latin America ( 29 ) . This article will present an overview of clinical and epide - miological aspects of Chagas’ disease , with a focus on data and issues speciﬁc to T . cruzi and Chagas’ disease in the United States . Topics to be covered include vector biology and ecol - ogy , animal reservoirs , T . cruzi strain typing , human Chagas’ disease , and future research needed for control of Chagas’ disease in the United States . TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI LIFE CYCLE AND TRANSMISSION Life Cycle Nearly all the salient features of the T . cruzi life cycle were described by Carlos Chagas , the scientist who discovered the organism , in 1909 ( 62 ) . T . cruzi is a kinetoplastid protozoan which infects vertebrate and invertebrate hosts during deﬁned stages in its life cycle ( 234 , 292 ) . The triatomine vector ingests circulating trypomastigotes when it takes a blood meal from an infected mammalian host . In the midgut of the vector , trypo - mastigotes transform through an intermediate form sometimes TABLE 1 .

Epimastigotes migrate to the hindgut and differentiate into infective metacyclic trypomas - tigotes , which are excreted with the feces of the vector . Meta - cyclic trypomastigotes enter through the bite wound or intact mucous membrane of the mammalian host and invade many types of nucleated cells through a lysosome - mediated mecha - nism ( 50 ) . In the cytoplasm , trypomastigotes differentiate into the intracellular amastigote form , which replicates with a dou - bling time of about 12 h over a period of 4 to 5 days . At the end of this period , the amastigotes transform into trypomastigotes , the host cell ruptures , and the trypomastigotes are released into the circulation . The circulating parasites can then invade new cells and initiate new replicative cycles , and they are avail - able to infect vectors that feed on the host . In the absence of successful antitrypanosomal treatment , the infection lasts for the lifetime of the mammalian host . Transmission Routes Vector - borne transmission . The vector - borne transmission route , occurring exclusively in the Americas , is still the pre - dominant mechanism for new human infections . The feces of infected bugs contain metacyclic trypomastigotes that can en - ter the human body through the bite wound or through intact conjunctiva or other mucous membranes . Congenital transmission . Between 1 and 10 % of infants of T . cruzi - infected mothers are born with congenital Chagas’ disease ( 14 , 24 , 289 ) . Congenital transmission can occur from women themselves infected congenitally , perpetuating the dis - ease in the absence of the vector ( 263 ) . Factors reported to increase risk include higher maternal parasitemia level , less robust anti - T . cruzi immune responses , younger maternal age , HIV and , in an animal model , parasite strain ( 9 , 32 , 34 , 107 , 289 ) . Blood - borne transmission . Transfusional T . cruzi transmis - sion was postulated in 1936 and ﬁrst documented in 1952 ( 109 , 307 ) . The risk of T . cruzi transmission per infected unit trans - fused is estimated to be 10 to 25 % ; platelet transfusions are thought to pose a higher risk than other components such as packed red cells ( 31 , 308 ) . In 1991 , the prevalence of T . cruzi infection in donated blood units ranged from 1 to 60 % in Latin American cities ( 268 ) . Since then , blood donation screening has become accepted as an important pillar of the Chagas’ disease control initiatives ( 220 , 269 ) . Serological screening of blood components for T . cruzi is now compulsory in all but one of the countries in Latin America where the disease is en - demic , and the prevalence of infection in screened donors has decreased substantially ( 196 , 269 ) . Nevertheless , Chagas’ dis - ease screening coverage by country was estimated to vary from 25 % to 100 % in 2002 , and the risk of transmission , though much decreased , has not been eliminated ( 269 ) . The residual risk in Latin America where screening has been implemented is estimated to be 1 : 200 , 000 units ( 269 , 308 ) . Organ - derived transmission . Uninfected recipients who re - ceive an organ from a T . cruzi - infected donor may develop acute T . cruzi infection . However , transmission is not universal ; in a series of 16 uninfected recipients of kidneys from infected donors , only 3 ( 19 % ) acquired T . cruzi infection ( 238 ) . Nine - teen instances of transmission by organ transplantation have been documented in the literature ( 13 kidney , 1 kidney and pancreas , 3 liver , and 2 heart transplants ) ( 16 , 61 , 66 , 79 , 99 , 101 , 157 , 238 , 279 ) . The risk from heart transplantation is thought to be higher than that from kidney or liver transplan - tation ( 65 ) . One case of transmission through unrelated cord blood transplantation has been reported ( 104 ) . Oral transmission . Recently , increasing attention has fo - cused on the oral route of T . cruzi transmission ; several out - breaks attributed to contaminated fruit or sugar cane juice have been reported from Brazil and Venezuela ( 28 , 82 , 208 ) . Most outbreaks are small , often affecting family groups in the Amazon region , where the palm fruit ac¸aí is a dietary staple that appears to be particularly vulnerable to contamination , perhaps from infected vectors living in the trees themselves ( 74 , 208 ) . The largest reported outbreak to date led to more than 100 infections among students and staff at a school in Caracas ; locally prepared guava juice was implicated ( 82 ) . TRIATOMINE VECTOR BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY Background The epidemiology of vector - borne T . cruzi is closely linked to the biological and ecological characteristics of local vectors and mammalian reservoir hosts . Triatomines of both sexes must take blood meals to develop through their nymphal stages to adults , and females require a blood meal to lay eggs . Thus , nymphs and adults of either sex may be infected with T . cruzi , but infection rates increase with increasing vector stage and age . Most domestic triatomine species feed nocturnally and are able to complete their blood meal without waking the host ( 169 ) . The major Latin American vectors defecate during or immediately after taking a blood meal . T . cruzi infection is transmitted to wild mammals by sylvatic triatomine species ; these bugs often colonize the nests of ro - dent or marsupial reservoir hosts ( 169 , 311 ) . Sylvatic triato - mine adults may ﬂy into human dwellings because of attraction by light and cause sporadic human infections ( 74 ) . Domestic transmission cycles occur where vectors have become adapted to living in human dwellings and nearby animal enclosures ; domestic mammals such as dogs , cats , and guinea pigs play important roles as triatomine blood meal sources and T . cruzi reservoir hosts ( 69 , 124 , 131 ) . Some triatomine species can infest both domestic and sylvatic sites and may play a bridging role ( 192 ) . There are more than 130 triatomine species in the Americas , many of which can be infected by and transmit T . cruzi ( 169 , 311 ) . However , a small number of highly domiciliated vectors are of disproportionate importance in the human epidemiol - ogy of disease ( Table 2 ) ( 311 ) . The domestic environment provides abundant blood meal sources , and poor quality hous - ing with adobe or unﬁnished brick walls provides crevices and other diurnal hiding places for triatomines ( 170 , 201 ) . Thatch roofs provide an attractive habitat for some species ( 117 ) . In communities where the disease is endemic , 25 to 100 % of houses may be infested , and a house and its immediate sur - roundings may support large colonies of juvenile and adult bugs ( 170 , 201 , 230 ) . In areas of the Amazon where deforestation and human immigration have occurred , tree - dwelling sylvatic triatomine V OL . 24 , 2011 T . CRUZI AND CHAGAS’ DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES 657 on O c t obe r 27 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / c m r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m populations have survived and rebounded by adapting to new vertebrate host species ( 2 ) . These opportunistic vertebrates ( opossums and rodents ) are competent Chagas’ disease reser - voirs and are acclimated to living in close proximity to humans where remnant vegetation is located . The concentration of triatomines and vertebrate reservoirs in the peridomestic realm has lead to increased interactions between sylvatic tri - atomine species and humans in deforested areas of the Ama - zon and Panama and to an apparent increase in the incidence of Chagas’ disease in humans ( 4 , 244 ) . Triatomine Distribution in the United States Eleven species of triatomine bugs have been reported from the United States : Triatoma gerstaeckeri , T . incrassata , T . indic - tiva , T . lecticularia , T . neotomae , T . protracta , T . recurva , T . rubida , T . rubrofasciata , T . sanguisuga , and Paratriatoma hirsuta ( Fig . 1 and Table 3 ) . Triatomines are present across the south - ern half of the country , distributed from the Paciﬁc to Atlantic coasts ( Fig . 2 ) . One species ( T . rubrofasciata ) is found in Hawaii . A high degree of polymorphism has been noted in several species across their geographic ranges , particularly T . protracta , T . rubida , and T . sanguisuga , resulting in proposed subspecies classiﬁcations ( 249 , 251 , 254 , 296 ) . However , due to the recognition of morphological intermediates across some subspecies groups and the absence of supporting data ( e . g . , paired molecular and morphological studies ) , these subspecies have not been universally accepted as valid taxonomic groups ( 110 , 169 ) . All U . S . species except T . rubrofasciata and T . sanguisuga have been collected in Mexico ; the distribution of T . sanguisuga likely extends into northeastern Mexico as well ( 255 ) . A review of the published literature from 1939 to 2010 resulted in re - ports of wild - caught triatomine bugs from 262 counties in 28 states . The greatest species diversity occurs in the southwest , particularly Texas , Arizona , and New Mexico . More speciﬁ - cally , high species diversity is concentrated in south - central Arizona and southwestern Texas , where up to ﬁve species have been recorded in a single county ( Fig . 2 ) . T . cruzi - infected specimens have been reported from 10 states , predominantly from counties in the Southwest ( Fig . 3A ) . All species except T . incrassata and P . hirsuta have been found naturally infected with T . cruzi ( Fig . 3B to L ) . County - level maps ( Fig . 2 and 3 ) reﬂect in part where col - lection efforts have been focused over the past 70 years . There is no evidence of a temporal or spatial trend in the published reports to suggest any recent migration of species into or within the United States . The county maps do not necessarily reﬂect triatomine population densities or provide a complete representation of their distributions . Rather , the maps more likely provide an indication of where the bugs have been con - sidered a pest to humans or animals and where ﬁeld efforts were concentrated as a consequence or where specimens were collected coincidentally by researchers studying other animal systems ( i . e . , reports based on museum specimens ) . Collection records are more comprehensive in the southwestern states and Florida , with sparse records in the southeastern states . Early discovery of the association of U . S . triatomine bugs with Neotoma species of woodrats may have aided ﬁeld research in TABLE 2 .

The absence of records in some areas of the southeastern United States may reﬂect a paucity of ﬁeld studies or published records in those locations rather than being an indication of true absence of the bug . The detection of T . cruzi - infected wild mammals in many of these areas suggests the presence of the vectors . Addition - ally , recent efforts to model the geographic distribution of U . S . species based on the land cover , climate , and host composition of known collection sites indicate favorable habitat suitability in many of these unsurveyed or underreported regions ( 26 , 137 , 158 , 259 ) . Characteristics of each species are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the sections that follow . Description of U . S . Triatomine Species Triatoma gerstaeckeri ( Stål ) . T . gerstaeckeri is one of the most frequently collected and tested species in the United States ; 57 . 7 % ( 1 , 038 / 1 , 800 ) of tested specimens were found to harbor T . cruzi . T . cruzi - infected specimens have been found in both Texas and New Mexico and in the majority of the counties where testing has been reported ( Fig . 3B ) . Published reports from the 1930s to 1960s describe T . gerstaeckeri as a pest species of humans and livestock ; the adult bugs were frequent invaders of rural houses in Texas , and reports of humans being bitten were common ( 217 , 330 , 332 ) . Human encounters have been less frequently reported in recent decades ( 49 , 151 ) . In - fected T . gerstaeckeri specimens were recently recovered from the residence of a child with acute Chagas’ disease in southern Texas ( 151 ) . In northeastern Mexico , this species is considered an important Chagas’ disease vector due to its close association TABLE 3 .

T . gerstaeckeri data de - rive predominantly from Texas , where the bug has been found in a wide variety of habitats . The species was collected from a rock squirrel burrow in a cave in the southeastern corner of New Mexico ( 341 ) . Triatoma incrassata Usinger . T . incrassata is somewhat sim - ilar to T . protracta in size and general appearance of legs and head , but it has a distinctive abdominal margin which is largely yellow on the dorsal surface and entirely yellow on the ventral surface . It has been collected at lights in the two southern Arizona counties of Santa Cruz and Pima ( Fig . 3C ) ( 169 , 255 ) . The major mammalian hosts and T . cruzi infection prevalence for this species are unknown . Triatoma indictiva Neiva . T . indictiva was considered a sub - species of T . sanguisuga in the past but is currently accorded full species status ( 110 , 169 , 296 ) . This species is very similar in appearance to T . sanguisuga , with the exception of the uni - formly black pronotum and narrower horizontal markings on the abdominal edge . The distributions of the two species over - lap in the central regions of Texas , with T . indictiva continuing further west to Arizona and T . sanguisuga continuing east to the Atlantic coast ( Fig . 3D and K ) . Reported collection of T . indictiva is much less frequent than that of T . sanguisuga . Ad - ditional collection sites for T . indictiva in New Mexico and Arizona were provided in a map by Lent and Wygodzinsky in 1979 , but speciﬁc location designations were not given ( 169 ) . Specimens were collected from woodrat nests in New Mexico and at lights in Texas ( 229 , 332 ) . T . indictiva has been found naturally infected with T . cruzi in specimens from Texas ( 151 , 229 ) . Triatoma lecticularia ( Stål ) . T . lecticularia has a geographic distribution similar to that of T . sanguisuga , from the south - central United States east to the Atlantic coast ( Fig . 3E ) . Its range probably includes Oklahoma , Arkansas , Louisiana , Mis - sissippi , and Alabama based on similarities in ecological char - acteristics between these states and adjacent areas where it has been reported . Specimens of T . lecticularia from New Mexico have been reported , but speciﬁc location information was not provided ( 254 , 296 ) .

Therefore , early reports of T . lecticularia and T . sanguisuga may be difﬁcult to conﬁrm without reviewing the actual specimens . Ryckman in 1984 contended that reports of T . lecticularia from Arizona and California are erroneous , presumably based on earlier taxo - nomic confusion and contemporary knowledge of the species distribution ( 254 ) . T . lecticularia can be distinguished from T . sanguisuga and T . indictiva based on its shorter , domed head and uniform covering of all body surfaces with dark hairs . T . lecticularia has been collected from houses , dog kennels , wood - rat nests , and rock squirrel burrows in hollow logs in Texas , from houses in South Carolina , and at lights in Missouri ( 151 , 195 , 256 , 312 , 345 ) . In early reports , this species was described as a nuisance species , commonly found in well - constructed homes of central Texas ( 218 ) . In 1940 , Packchanian conducted experimental inoculation of the gut contents of a T . cruzi - infected T . lecticularia bug into the eye of a human subject in order to demonstrate the infectivity of a T . cruzi strain from Texas ( 216 ) . Localized symptoms , fever , lymphadenopathy , and trypomastigotes visualized on blood ﬁlms conﬁrmed infec - tion in this individual . The high T . cruzi infection prevalence ( 144 / 282 ; 51 % ) in T . lecticularia was derived primarily from specimens collected from woodrat nests in Texas ( 282 , 332 ) . Triatoma neotomae Neiva . In the United States , T . neotomae is known only from Texas , primarily the southern tip ( Fig . 3F ) . The inclusion of other states in its range by some authors is most likely an error , as published records of T . neotomae out - side Texas or northeastern Mexico could not be found . This species is similar in size to T . protracta but with distinctive yellow markings around the abdominal margin and basal half of wings , a glossy body surface , and a ventrally ﬂattened ab - domen . Also like T . protracta , this species is closely associated with Neotoma spp . of woodrats , for which it was named . It has been found almost exclusively in woodrat nests throughout its range , with a single report from a dog kennel in Cameron County , TX ( 151 ) . The small sample size limits interpretation of this species’ high cumulative T . cruzi infection prevalence ( 40 / 53 ; 76 % ) ; however , this is likely related to the high infec - tion levels reported among woodrats in this region ( 49 , 93 , 219 ) . Triatoma protracta ( Uhler ) . T . cruzi was ﬁrst reported in the United States from a T . protracta specimen collected in 1916 in a woodrat nest in San Diego County , CA ( 155 ) . T . cruzi testing data are most abundant for this species , with an overall prev - alence of 17 . 5 % ( 723 / 4 , 124 ) . Infected specimens have been reported from four of seven states across its range : California , Arizona , New Mexico , and Texas ( Fig . 3G ) . T . protracta is closely associated with western woodrat species and is com - monly found in nests throughout the bug’s geographic distri - bution . Large aggregations of T . protracta were reported from roadbeds in southern California in an area where woodrat nests were removed as a consequence of highway construction ( 340 ) . Attracted by lights , the displaced bugs frequently en - tered houses in the area and became a source of annoyance for residents . T . protracta has also been reported as frequently entering houses in other areas of California , New Mexico , and Arizona ( 187 , 273 , 304 , 332 , 336 ) . First reported as a pest of humans in Yosemite Valley , CA , in the 1860s , T . protracta continues to be an important cause of severe allergic reactions in humans who are bitten ( 152 , 198 ) . This species was impli - cated in a human case of Chagas’ disease in north - central California ( 203 ) . Triatoma recurva ( Stål ) . T . recurva naturally infected with T . cruzi has been found in the southern half of Arizona ( Fig . 3H ) . A single report of T . recurva collected in western Texas has not been conﬁrmed or replicated ( 138 , 151 ) . Early reports describe T . recurva as a pest of humans , primarily in the Alvardo Mine area of Yavapai County , AZ , where it was a common invader of houses and tents of mining employees ( 332 , 336 ) . Recent reports describe home invasions and hypersensitivity reactions due to bites that occurred in and around houses in Pima and Cochise Counties , AZ ( 152 , 237 ) . Although the species has been collected occasionally from woodrat nests , the woodrat is not considered the primary host of T . recurva ( 96 , 255 , 321 ) . The preferred host for this species is unknown , but it has been observed in association with rodents , particularly rock squir - rels , and feeds on reptiles and guinea pigs in laboratory settings ( 96 , 255 , 324 , 334 , 336 ) . T . recurva is the largest of the U . S . species ( average length , 29 mm ) and has relatively hairless body surfaces , including the ﬁrst two segments of the mouth - parts . It is brown to black in appearance , with slender , long legs and head and an orange - yellow abdominal margin . Its body size , head and leg characteristics , and uniformly colored pro - notum distinguish this species from others in its range . Triatoma rubida ( Uhler ) . In the United States , T . rubida has been found from western Texas to southern California ; T . cruzi - positive specimens have been reported from Arizona and Texas ( Fig . 3I ) . The cumulative infection prevalence in the published literature is low ( 96 / 1 , 340 ; 7 . 2 % ) . However , in a recent study , the gut contents of 65 ( 41 % ) of 158 T . rubida specimens collected in and around houses in Pima County , AZ , yielded positive results by T . cruzi PCR ( 237 ) . Despite the presence of nymphal stages inside houses in this study , the authors remarked that the numbers were too low to conclude that colonization was established . In contrast , a study from Sonora , Mexico , reported that 68 % of houses were colo - nized by T . rubida , suggesting that this species was domes - ticated in that region ( 221 ) . Both the U . S . and Mexican study areas had experienced disruption of previously undis - turbed environments considered suitable habitats for both triatomine and T . cruzi vertebrate hosts . Human bite en - counters , including hypersensitivity reactions due to T . ru - bida , continue to be a public health issue in Arizona ( 152 , 226 , 237 ) . This species has been frequently collected from woodrat nests throughout its range ( 96 , 256 , 321 , 332 , 336 ) . It can be distinguished morphologically from other species in its range by the ﬁrst antennal segment , which reaches or surpasses the tip of the head . Triatoma rubrofasciata ( DeGeer ) . Described in 1733 , T . rubrofasciata was the ﬁrst species classiﬁed in the Triatominae subfamily and is the current type species for the Triatoma genus ( 270 ) . It is the only triatomine species found in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres and is frequently found in port cities in close association with the roof rat ( Rattus rattus ) ( 255 ) . Molecular and morphometric data support the hypoth - esis that Old World triatomine species derive from T . rubro - fasciata carried from North America with rats on sailing ships during the colonial period ( 136 , 223 , 270 ) . In the United States , this species has been collected from houses in Florida and Hawaii and in chicken and pigeon coops and cat houses in V OL . 24 , 2011 T .

Specimens have been reported from Jacksonville , FL , and Honolulu , HI ( Fig . 3J ) ( 296 , 337 ) . Wood ( in 1946 ) re - ported 2 specimens collected from Honolulu to be infected with T . cruzi based on morphological and motility characteris - tics ( 337 ) . Allergic reactions to T . rubrofasciata bites have been reported in humans from Hawaii ( 12 ) . Triatoma sanguisuga ( Leconte ) . T . sanguisuga is one of the most widely distributed species in the United States , with its range spanning from Texas and Oklahoma eastward to the Atlantic coast ( Fig . 3K ) . This species has been reported in Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Maryland , and Kentucky , but with - out speciﬁc location data ( 169 , 254 , 296 ) . Although published records are lacking , its range probably includes West Virginia . Reports of T . sanguisuga from states west of Texas were likely mistaken due to taxonomic reclassiﬁcation ( see “ Triatoma in - dictiva Neiva” above ) . In every state where testing has been conducted , T . cruzi - infected T . sanguisuga has been found , including Texas , Oklahoma , Louisiana , Alabama , Tennessee , Georgia , and Florida . It has been collected from diverse nat - ural settings across its range , in association with many different vertebrate hosts , including woodrats , cottonrats , armadillos , raccoons , opossums , frogs , dogs , chickens , horses , and humans ( 120 , 150 , 212 , 215 , 332 , 348 ) . Human annoyance and allergic reactions to T . sanguisuga bites were reported as early as the mid - 1800s in Georgia , Kansas , Oklahoma , and Florida and recently in Louisiana ( 116 , 147 , 152 , 161 , 215 ) . This species was found inside the residences of human Chagas’ disease patients in Tennessee and Louisiana and in the vicinity of the home of a T . cruzi - seropositive blood donor in Missis - sippi ( 54 , 90 , 134 ) . Paratriatoma hirsuta Barber . P . hirsuta is known from the western United States , collected from arid regions of Califor - nia , Nevada , and Arizona ( Fig . 3L ) . Although it has been demonstrated to be a competent vector of T . cruzi in experi - mental settings , a naturally infected specimen has yet to be reported ( 321 ) . It has been most frequently collected from woodrat nests in its range but has also been found in houses and other human dwellings in Yavapai County , AZ , and Riv - erside County , CA , and at lights in Palm Springs , CA ( 251 , 296 , 336 ) . Ryckman ( in 1981 ) described this species as having im - portant public health signiﬁcance due to allergic reactions caused by its bite ( 252 ) . This is one of the smallest U . S . triato - mine species ( average length , 13 mm ) and can be distinguished from T . protracta , which is similar in size and geographic dis - tribution , by a pervasive covering of dark hairs on all body surfaces . Human - Vector Interactions and T . cruzi Transmission Potential in the United States Eight of the 11 species have been associated with human bites , and seven have been implicated in allergic reactions ( Table 3 ) . Allergic reactions occur in response to antigens delivered in the vector saliva during blood feeding and are unrelated to the T . cruzi infection status of the bug . Most allergic reactions are localized at the bite site , characterized by a large welt and intense itching ( 315 ) . Severe reactions are generally systemic and may involve angiodema , urticaria , dif - ﬁculty breathing , nausea , diarrhea , and / or anaphylaxis ( 152 , 226 ) . Although allergic reactions to triatomine bites have been reported from states throughout the southern United States , the incidence is highest in the southwestern states , with T . protracta and T . rubida most frequently implicated ( 106 , 152 , 204 , 226 , 237 ) . The most common scenario involves invasion of an adult bug into a human dwelling , where it bites a sleeping individual . Contemporary encounters between humans and triatomine bugs in the United States are often associated with destruction or invasion of vertebrate host habitats , compromised housing structures , or both . Disruption of host burrows ( as described above for T . protracta ) provokes the bugs to seek new refuges , and their innate attraction to lights often leads them to nearby human dwellings . Most triatomine species show ﬂexibility in host and habitat requirements , which allows them to adapt to changing environments . A host preference for some species has been difﬁcult to establish due to association with multiple vertebrate habitats and the ability of the insects to mature and reproduce successfully on multiple host species in laboratory settings . Although mammals are the only vertebrate reservoirs for T . cruzi , many triatomine species utilize other animal groups as blood hosts , including reptiles and amphibians ( T . gerstaeckeri , T . protracta , T . recurva , T . rubida , and T . san - guisuga ) and birds ( T . gerstaeckeri and T . sanguisuga ) ( 169 , 228 , 253 , 338 ) . A recent blood meal analysis study of Texas ﬁeld specimens provides evidence of a broad host range for T . gerstaeckeri and T . sanguisuga . The DNAs from nine vertebrate species ( woodrat , dog , cat , cow , pig , raccoon , skunk , armadillo , and human ) were detected in T . gerstaeckeri gut specimens , and DNAs from three species ( dog , avian , and human ) were de - tected in T . sanguisuga gut specimens ( 149 ) . Because vector colonization of houses in the United States is rare , the risk of vector - borne transmission to humans is con - sidered to be quite low . With the exception of the 2006 Loui - siana case in which the residence was found to harbor triato - mine colonies , vector - borne transmission to humans in the United States has been attributed to adult bugs invading houses ( 90 , 134 , 203 ) . Expansion of human settlements into environments that support an active sylvatic disease cycle could result in an increase in adult invaders and , potentially , coloni - zation events . Colonization of houses by triatomines is an im - portant factor in vector - borne transmission because it in - creases the probability of encounters between humans and potentially infected vectors . In addition to adaptability to domestic structures , triatomine feeding and defecation behaviors are important risk factors for vector - borne transmission and vary across species . The timing and placement of defecation after feeding greatly inﬂuence the risk of transmission via fecal contamination of the host bite site or other exposed tissues . A small number of studies have re - ported on these characteristics in U . S . species . In 1951 Wood reported the following average postfeeding defecation times ( minutes ) for the adults of four U . S . species : T . protracta , 30 . 6 ( n (cid:3) 10 ) ; T . rubida , 1 . 6 ( n (cid:3) 5 ) ; T . recurva , 75 . 7 ( n (cid:3) 3 ) ; and P . hirusta , 35 . 0 ( n (cid:3) 2 ) ( 327 ) . In a similar study in 2007 using both nymphs and adults of three Mexican species ( also present in the United States ) , Martinez - Ibarra et al . reported the fol - lowing results : T . protracta , 6 . 7 ( n (cid:3) 475 ) ; T . lecticularia , 8 . 3 ( n (cid:3) 368 ) ; and T . gerstaeckeri , 11 . 5 ( n (cid:3) 733 ) ( 183 ) . Likewise , Zeledon et al . ( 1970 ) reported the following results for nymphs and adults of three Latin American species : R . prolixus , 3 . 2 662 BERN ET AL . C LIN . M ICROBIOL . R EV . on O c t obe r 27 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / c m r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m ( n (cid:3) 210 ) ; T . infestans , 3 . 5 ( n (cid:3) 210 ) ; and T . dimidiata , 11 . 3 ( n (cid:3) 210 ) ( 352 ) . In 1970 Pippin reported the proportion of bugs defecating within 2 min postfeeding for adults of two U . S . and one Latin American species : R . prolixus , 74 . 6 % ( n (cid:3) 169 ) ; T . gerstaeckeri 19 . 4 % ( n (cid:3) 160 ) ; and T . sanguisuga 16 . 9 % ( n (cid:3) 136 ) ( 228 ) . Similarly , in 2009 Klotz et al . reported the propor - tion of bugs defecating before or directly after feeding for adults of two U . S . species : T . rubida , 45 % ( n (cid:3) 40 ) ; and T . protracta , 19 . 4 % ( n (cid:3) 31 ) ( 153 ) . In that study , it was noted that none of the bugs of either species defecated on the host during the experiment . Although direct comparisons across studies is problematic due to variation in methods and conditions ( e . g . , temperature , blood host , and feeding apparatus ) , it appears that U . S . species in general exhibit greater postfeeding defe - cation delays than important Latin American vector species . Delayed defecation and a low frequency of domestic coloniza - tion contribute to a low probability of autochthonous U . S . human infection due to vector - borne transmission , which is the primary route of infection in areas of hyperendemicity in Latin America . ANIMAL RESERVOIRS OF TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI Background Concurrent with the demonstration of T . cruzi in the ﬁrst recognized human patient , Carlos Chagas observed the para - site in the blood of a domestic cat in the same household ( 62 ) . Subsequently , Chagas went on to demonstrate T . cruzi in armadillos and primates , conﬁrming the role of wildlife as reservoirs ( 63 , 64 ) . To date , over 100 mammalian species have been reported as natural hosts for T . cruzi , and all mammals are considered to be susceptible to infection . Birds are refrac - tory to infection due to complement - mediated lysis and mac - rophage - induced killing of the parasites ( 146 , 188 ) . Although T . cruzi has a wide host range , the epidemiologically important reservoirs vary by geographic region due to the biology and ecology of the mammals and vectors and how these interac - tions translate to risk of human exposure . Opossums and armadillos are important reservoirs throughout the Americas , a ﬁnding consistent with genetic data suggesting that these two groups are the ancestral hosts for the two major ancestral lineages of T . cruzi ( 112 , 349 ) . Transmission routes for wildlife and domestic animal species are similar to those for humans . Sylvatic animals become in - fected during feeding activity of vectors present in their bur - rows , dens , or temporary shelters . As in humans , infection occurs when bug feces containing the parasites enters a wound or mucous membrane . In addition , the insectivorous behavior of many animals ( e . g . , woodrats ) increases the likelihood of infection via the ingestion of infected bugs ( 78 , 241 , 250 ) . Transplacental transmission has been documented in labora - tory mice and rats ( 15 , 81 , 127 ) . Although not proven to occur in wildlife , this route likely contributes to maintenance of the parasite in the sylvatic cycle as well . Ingestion of infected meat was once considered a possible route of transmission , but a recent study with raccoons suggests that this is probably un - common ( 241 ) . Wildlife Reservoirs of T . cruzi in the United States In the United States , natural T . cruzi infection was ﬁrst reported in the big - eared woodrat Neotoma macrotis ( syn . N . fuscepes macrotis ) in California ( 316 ) . In the 1940s , natural infections were reported from house mice , southern plains woodrats ( N . micropus ) , nine - banded armadillos ( Dasypus novemcinctus ) , and Virginia opossums ( Didelphis virginiana ) in Texas and from brush mice ( Peromyscus boylii rowleyi ) and woodrats ( N . albigula ) in Arizona ( 219 , 321 ) . Early experimen - tal infection trials with parasites from these hosts and Triatoma spp . indicated that laboratory rats , laboratory mice , guinea pigs , domestic dogs , rhesus macaques , opossums ( D . virgini - ana ) , six species of Peromyscus , and four species of woodrats were susceptible ( 77 , 154 , 215 , 217 , 316 , 321 ) . In addition , an isolate from a naturally infected Triatoma species from Texas was shown to be infectious to a human ( 216 ) . Subsequent surveys in the 1950s and 1960s documented infections in rac - coons ( Procyon lotor ) , Virginia opossums , striped skunks ( Me - phitis mephitis ) , and gray foxes ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) in the southeastern United States ( 185 , 212 , 305 ) . Currently , at least 24 species are recognized as natural wild - life hosts for T . cruzi in the United States ( Table 4 ) . Reported T . cruzi infection rates vary widely by host species and geo - graphic area . However , the observed variation may be due in part to the use of different diagnostic assays with very different sensitivities . As in humans , the majority of infected animals are in the chronic phase of the infection ; therefore , serological testing is more sensitive than methods that rely on detection of parasites ( 346 ) . However , unlike serological tests , visualization of the parasites allows the examiner to distinguish T . cruzi from other Trypanosoma species ( e . g . , T . neotomae , T . kansasensis , T . peromysci , and T . lewisi - like sp . ) reported from rodents based on morphology ( 186 , 207 , 294 , 317 , 328 ; M . J . Yabsley , unpublished data ) . If serology is used for screening , infections should be conﬁrmed with a T . cruzi - speciﬁc assay . Some PCR assays will amplify other Trypanosoma and / or Leishmania spe - cies , and more speciﬁc methods may be necessary to conﬁrm the infection as T . cruzi . The primary reservoirs and transmission dynamics of T . cruzi differ between the eastern and western regions of the United States . The greatest vector diversity and density occur in the western United States ( Fig . 2 ) , where many triatomine species live in the nests of woodrats . In this region , woodrats are the most common reservoir ; however , infection has also been dem - onstrated in other rodents , raccoons , skunks , and coyotes ( Ta - ble 4 ; Fig . 4A and B ) . Rodents other than woodrats utilize habitats similar to those of woodrats ( old woodrat nests , small caves , and holes in rock walls ) where triatomines are found , while coyotes , raccoons , skunks , and opossums likely become infected when bugs feed on them in their dens or through ingestion of bugs . In the eastern United States , the prevalence of T . cruzi is highest in raccoons , opossums , armadillos , and skunks ( Table 4 ; Fig . 4A and B ) . There are several woodrat species in the eastern United States , but densities are much lower than for woodrat species in the western United States , and nests are less evident because they utilize burrows instead of large above - ground constructed nests . Little is known about the prevalence of T . cruzi in eastern woodrat species . To date , only one survey for T . cruzi has been conducted , and none of 23 V OL . 24 , 2011 T .

Re - ports of wildlife infections are shown at the county level ( when possible ) in Fig . 4A and B . Domestic and Exotic Animal Infections in the United States In addition to indigenous wildlife reservoirs , domestic and exotic animals can become infected if they are present in an enzootic area and come in contact with infected bugs . Trans - mission routes are similar to those for wildlife , with ingestion of bugs likely being an important route . Canine Chagas’ disease . In Central and South America , domestic dogs are important reservoirs in the domestic cycle and can be used as sentinels for local transmission ( 123 ) . A similar cycle has been recognized in the United States , but the importance of domestic dogs as T . cruzi infection reservoirs is not as well understood ( 26 ) . T . cruzi infection in domestic dogs has been reported widely throughout the southern United States since 1972 ( Fig . 4C ) ( 18 , 20 , 23 , 41 , 105 , 134 , 150 , 189 , 205 , 206 , 239 , 274 , 287 , 298 , 312 ) . Infection has been docu - mented in at least 48 different breeds in the United States , with the sporting and working breeds accounting for the majority of cases , presumably due to greater exposure to infected vectors and mammalian tissues ( 150 , 246 ) . As in humans , transplacen - tal transmission is also an important mode of transmission in dogs ( 23 , 58 ) . Domestic dogs can develop both acute and chronic disease similar to that in humans . Acute illness , par - ticularly mortality , has been reported more frequently in very young dogs ( (cid:4) 1 year old ) and generally involves myocarditis and cardiac arrhythmias ( 150 ) . Dogs that survive infection at a very young age or acquire infection as adults generally experi - ence a chronic course of disease that may progress to signiﬁ - cant cardiac dysfunction , typically involving cardiac dilatation , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities , and clinical signs re - lated to right - sided or bilateral cardiac failure ( 21 , 22 ) . In a recent seroprevalence study in Tennessee , older dogs ( ages 6 to 10 years ) were more likely to be infected ( 246 ) , which is similar to results of studies in Latin America that reported increasing seropositivity with increasing age ( 97 , 122 ) . Dogs with clinically apparent infections are managed with appropri - ate supportive therapy .

Primates and other exotic animals . Any mammals kept in areas where bugs may enter are at risk of acquiring T . cruzi infection . Because U . S . animal use guidelines require that non - human primates be housed in facilities with access to the out - doors , they may be at particular risk of acquiring T . cruzi infection . Exotic animals that acquire T . cruzi infection may be asymptomatic or may develop symptomatic , even lethal , clini - cal disease . Severe disease may be due to a large parasite inoculum from exposure to or ingestion of a large number of infected bugs but may also reﬂect variation in susceptibility of animal species to clinical Chagas’ disease . Mortality due to locally acquired T . cruzi infection has occurred in groups of captive animals in the United States , including baboons ( Papio hamadryas ) , rhesus macaques , crab - eating macaques ( M . fas - cicularis ) , Celebes black macaques ( M . nigra ) , sugar gliders ( Petaurus breviceps ) , and a hedgehog ( Atelerix albiventris ) ( 8 , 115 , 145 , 213 , 313 ) . Asymptomatic T . cruzi infection has been reported in lion - tailed macaques ( M . silenus ) , pigtailed ma - caques ( M . nemestrina ) , rhesus macaques , baboons , ring - tailed lemurs ( Lemur catta ) , and black and white ruffed lemurs ( Va - recia variegata ) in the United States ( 11 , 128 , 145 , 232 , 264 ) . MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY OF T . CRUZI General Molecular Epidemiology T . cruzi is a genetically heterogeneous species that also has wide variability in biological and biochemical characteristics ( 51 , 174 , 191 , 192 ) . The most common historical classiﬁcation divided T . cruzi into two major groups , TcI and TcII ; TcII was further divided into ﬁve subgroups ( also called discrete typing units ) designated TcIIa to TcIIe ( 51 , 193 , 309 ) . Recently , a consensus was reached that the six major recognized lineages will be renamed TcI to TcVI ; compared to the earlier system , TcI remained TcI , TcIIb became TcII , TcIIc became TcIII , TcIIa became TcIV , TcIId became TcV , and TcIIe became TcVI ( 353 ) . For the purposes of this review , data from earlier studies that genotyped isolates as TcII ( without a to d subtyp - ing ) will be referred to as “historic TcII” to differentiate these types from the current TcII , which is equivalent to the historic TcIIb lineage . The TcI and TcII lineages are considered an - cestral , whereas the TcV and TcVI lineages are the products of at least two hybridization events ( 309 , 353 ) . The origins of TcIII and TcIV are as yet unresolved ( 353 ) . Whereas some investigators consider TcIII to represent a third ancestral strain ( 80 ) , others consider it to be the result of hybridization between TcI and TcII ( 309 , 310 ) . TcI and TcII to TcVI are estimated to have diverged between 88 and 37 million years ago ( 43 , 175 ) . Currently , T . cruzi genotypes are classiﬁed based on size polymorphism or sequence analysis of several gene loci , including the miniexon gene , the intergenic region of the miniexon gene , the 18S rRNA gene , the 24S (cid:5) rRNA gene , internal transcribed spacer regions , and numerous housekeep - ing genes ( 171 , 310 ) . The TcI lineage is found throughout the Americas in both domestic and sylvatic cycles and is believed to have evolved with arboreal Didelphimorpha ( opossums ) and vectors in the triatomine tribe Rhodniini ( 112 ) . In all parts of the Americas , Didelphis spp . are common reservoirs for this lineage , although natural infection with TcI has been reported in a wide range of mammals . TcI is the only lineage reported from humans in North and Central America and the predominant lineage re - ported in human Chagas’ disease in areas of South America north of the Amazon Basin ( 40 , 139 , 239 , 258 ) . Although TcI has long been recognized as genetically di - verse , subtyping has not been widely conducted until very re - cently , and no generally accepted typing system or nomencla - ture currently exists . Additionally , many isolates have been FIG . 4 . Reports of natural Trypanosoma cruzi infection in U . S . mammals .

Haplotypes were ﬁrst recognized following sequence analysis of the inter - genic regions of the miniexon genes of 12 isolates from Co - lumbia ( 132 ) . Based on single - nucleotide polymorphisms , in - sertions , and deletions , four haplotypes , TcIa to TcId , were proposed . Haplotypes TcIa and TcIc were associated with hu - mans and domiciliated vectors . Haplotypes TcIb and TcId were found in specimens from one human , opossums , and sylvatic vectors ; TcId was found exclusively in sylvatic samples ( 132 ) . Interestingly , phylogenetic analysis of the same gene region of 20 TcI strains from the United States , Mexico , Bo - livia , Brazil , Columbia , and Argentina showed that Didelphis sp . isolates grouped separately from other isolates ( 210 ) . A ﬁfth haplotype ( TcIe ) was recently detected in a human and a sylvatic vector ( Mepraia spinolai ) from Chile and in one do - mestic vector ( T . infestans ) from Argentina ( 76 ) . Multilocus microsatellite proﬁling of 135 TcI isolates provided better dis - crimination and increased levels of variability among TcI syl - vatic strains ( 173 ) . However , in contrast to previous studies in which opossums were found to be infected with a particular haplotype ( 210 ) , no host association was noted . The authors suggest that the ecological niche might be more important for parasite evolution and diversiﬁcation than reservoir host spe - cies ( 173 ) . Wider use of multilocus typing methods may pro - vide further insight into TcI genetic diversity in the future . Lineage TcIII ( historical TcIIc ) is believed to have evolved with terrestrial burrowing edentates , speciﬁcally armadillos , and bugs in the triatomine tribe Triatomini ( 112 , 349 ) . Eden - tates and marsupials were the ﬁrst mammal inhabitants of South America ( (cid:6) 65 million years ago ) , whereas rodents , pri - mates , and bats arrived in South America (cid:6) 25 million years ago ( 112 ) . Upon arrival , these mammals became hosts to the various lineages of T . cruzi . TcIII is found throughout South America and is rare in domestic cycles but common in sylvatic cycles ( 172 , 349 ) . The primary hosts for TcIII are several dif - ferent species of armadillos , primarily D . novemcinctus . Addi - tionally , TcIII has been reported from limited numbers of a terrestrial marsupial ( Monodelphis domestica ) , rodents , and skunks ( 349 ) . TcII , TcV , and TcVI ( historic IIb , IId , and IIe , respectively ) are the lineages most commonly reported in human Chagas’ disease in southern South America ( 193 ) . All three lineages are closely associated with the domestic transmission cycle and the domestic vector Triatoma infestans . TcV and TcVI have been reported in cardiomyopathy and intestinal megasyn - dromes in the Southern Cone ( Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , and Brazil ) ( 57 , 193 ) . In contrast , intestinal Chagas’ disease is rare in northern South America , Central America , and Mexico , where TcI is the predominant lineage ( 191 ) . TcV is the lineage reported most frequently in infants with congenital infection , although this may simply reﬂect its predominance in Bolivia and Argentina , where these studies have been conducted ( 72 , 303 ) . The two hybrid lineages , TcV and TcVI , are hypothe - sized to have evolved in armadillos ( 181 , 349 ) . A single isola - tion of TcII ( historic TcIIb ) was reported from Euphractus sexcinctus ( six - banded armadillo ) in Paraguay , but its original mammalian host has not been established ( 193 , 349 ) . Currently , the TcIV ( historic IIa ) lineage is poorly under - stood . Studies of several gene targets indicate that TcIV strains from North and South America are genetically distinct and group separately in phylogenetic analyses ( 181 ; D . M . Roellig and M . J . Yabsley , unpublished data ) . In South America , TcIV is found in a wide range of mammals , including primates , rodents , armadillos , and terrestrial marsupials ( 349 ) . In North America , the raccoon is the principal host for TcIV ; infections have been reported in domestic dogs , striped skunks , armadil - los , and primates ( 239 ) . Interestingly , two terrestrial marsupial genera ( Philander and Monodelphis ) can harbor both TcI and several other ge - notypes , whereas only TcI has been reported from the arboreal genus Didelphis ( 163 , 225 , 240 ) . The genus Philander also dis - plays a more severe inﬂammatory response to T . cruzi ( 162 , 163 ) . Experimental inoculation of Monodelphis domestica with TcI , TcII , and TcVI strains resulted in infections , but a North American TcIV isolate failed to establish an infection ( 242 ) . Collectively , these data suggest that the marsupial genera di - verged before the establishment of host relationships with T . cruzi and that utilization of different ecological niches resulted in distinct T . cruzi lineage transmission patterns ( 163 ) . T . cruzi Genotypes in the United States In the United States , only two genotypes ( TcI and TcIV ) have been reported from mammals and vectors ( Table 5 ) . Consistent with the ﬁndings in South American studies of Didelphis , TcI is the only genotype reported from D . virginiana , the Virginia opossum ( 17 , 68 , 239 ) . In raccoons , TcIV predom - inates , but TcI has been detected in a small number of speci - mens . Both TcI and TcIV have been reported from nine - banded armadillos , domestic dogs , and rhesus macaques ( 68 , 239 ) . Lineage TcIV has been reported from a limited number of ring - tailed lemurs and a striped skunk ( 239 ) . Although the majority of isolates from placental mammals in the United States have been TcIV , all ﬁve typed isolates from human TABLE 5 . Genotypes of U . S . T . cruzi isolates Species No .

Both TcI and TcIV have been reported from Triatoma spp . from Georgia , Florida , and Texas . CLINICAL ASPECTS OF CHAGAS’ DISEASE Acute T . cruzi Infection The incubation period following vector - borne T . cruzi expo - sure is 1 to 2 weeks , after which the acute phase begins ( 234 ) . The acute phase lasts 8 to 12 weeks and is characterized by circulating trypomastigotes detectable by microscopy of fresh blood or buffy coat smears . Most patients are asymptomatic or have mild , nonspeciﬁc symptoms such as fever and therefore do not come to clinical attention during the acute phase . In some patients , acute infection is associated with inﬂammation and swelling at the site of inoculation , known as a chagoma . Chagomas typically occur on the face or extremities ; parasites may be demonstrated in the lesion . Inoculation via the con - junctiva leads to the characteristic unilateral swelling of the upper and lower eyelids known as the Roman˜a sign ( 234 ) . Severe acute disease occurs in fewer than 1 % of patients ; manifestations include acute myocarditis , pericardial effusion , and / or meningoencephalitis ( 3 , 177 ) . Children younger than 2 years appear to be at higher risk of severe manifestations than older individuals . Severe acute Chagas’ disease carries a sub - stantial risk of mortality . Orally transmitted T . cruzi infection appears to be associated with more severe acute morbidity and higher mortality than vector - borne infection ( 28 , 271 ) . For example , 75 % of 103 infected individuals in the Caracas outbreak were symptom - atic , 59 % had ECG abnormalities , 20 % were hospitalized , and there was one death from acute myocarditis ( 82 ) . Recent lab - oratory data suggest that parasite contact with host gastric acid may render trypomastigotes more invasive through changes in parasite surface glycoproteins and that this interaction may underlie the increased clinical severity seen in orally acquired Chagas’ disease ( 75 , 350 ) . Congenital T . cruzi Infection Most infected newborns are asymptomatic or have subtle ﬁndings , but a minority present with severe life - threatening disease ( 32 , 289 ) . The manifestations of symptomatic congen - ital Chagas’ disease can include low birth weight , prematurity , low Apgar scores , hepatosplenomegaly , anemia , and throm - bocytopenia ( 35 , 36 , 177 , 289 ) . Severely affected neonates may have meningoencephalitis , gastrointestinal megasyn - dromes , anasarca , pneumonitis , and / or respiratory distress ( 35 – 37 , 289 ) . Mortality among infected infants is signiﬁ - cantly higher than in uninfected infants , ranging from (cid:4) 5 % to 20 % in published studies ( 34 , 289 ) . However , even severe congenital Chagas’ disease may not be recognized because signs are often nonspeciﬁc or because the diagnosis is not considered ( 289 ) . Chronic T . cruzi Infection Eight to 12 weeks after infection , parasitemia levels become undetectable by microscopy , and in the absence of effective etiological treatment , the individual passes into the chronic phase of T . cruzi infection . Despite the absence of microscop - ically detectable parasites in the peripheral blood , persons with chronic T . cruzi infection maintain the potential to transmit the parasite to the vector and directly to other humans through blood components , through organ donation , and congenitally ( 177 , 311 ) . Indeterminate form of chronic T . cruzi infection . Persons with chronic T . cruzi infection but without signs or symptoms of Chagas’ disease are considered to have the indeterminate form . The strict deﬁnition of the indeterminate form requires positive anti - T . cruzi serology , with no symptoms or physical examination abnormalities , normal 12 - lead ECG , and normal radiological examination of the chest , esophagus , and colon ( 194 ) . Current baseline evaluation guidelines in the United States recommend only a history , physical examination , and ECG ( 30 ) . Further cardiac evaluation is recommended only if cardiac signs or symptoms are present , and barium studies are recommended only in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms ( 30 ) . An estimated 20 to 30 % of people who initially have the indeterminate form of Chagas’ disease progress over a period of years to decades to clinically evident cardiac and / or gastro - intestinal disease ( 234 ) . Cardiac Chagas’ disease . Chagas’ cardiomyopathy is char - acterized by a chronic inﬂammatory process that involves all chambers , damage to the conduction system , and often an apical aneurysm . The pathogenesis is hypothesized to involve parasite persistence in cardiac tissue and immune - mediated myocardial injury ( 182 ) . The earliest manifestations are usually conduction system abnormalities , most frequently right - bundle branch block or left anterior fascicular block , and segmental left ventricular wall motion abnormalities ( 178 ) . Later mani - festations include complex ventricular extrasystoles and non - sustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia , sinus node dysfunction that may lead to severe bradycardia , high - degree heart block , apical aneurysm usually in the left ventricle , thromboembolic phenomena due to thrombus formation in the dilated left ventricle or aneurysm , and progressive dilated car - diomyopathy with congestive heart failure ( 233 ) . These abnor - malities lead to palpitations , presyncope , syncope , and a high risk of sudden death ( 235 , 236 ) . Digestive Chagas’ disease . Gastrointestinal involvement is less common than Chagas’ heart disease . This form is seen predominantly in patients infected in the countries of the Southern Cone ( Argentina , Bolivia , Chile , Paraguay , Southern Peru , Uruguay , and parts of Brazil ) and is rare in northern South America , Central America , and Mexico . This geograph - ical pattern is thought to be linked to differences in the pre - dominant T . cruzi genotypes ( 51 , 192 ) . Gastrointestinal Cha - gas’ disease usually affects the esophagus and / or colon , resulting from damage to intramural neurons ( 83 , 84 , 199 ) . The effects on the esophagus span a spectrum from asymptom - atic motility disorders through mild achalasia to severe megae - sophagus ( 83 ) . Symptoms include dysphagia , odynophagia , esophageal reﬂux , weight loss , aspiration , cough , and regurgi - tation . As in idiopathic achalasia , the risk of esophageal car - cinoma is elevated ( 13 , 47 ) . Megacolon is characterized by prolonged constipation and may give rise to fecaloma , volvu - lus , and bowel ischemia . 668 BERN ET AL . C LIN . M ICROBIOL .

Acute T . cruzi infection in organ recipients has several features that differ from those of acute T . cruzi infection in immuno - competent hosts . The incubation period can be prolonged : among the 15 patients for whom data were available in pub - lished reports , the mean time from transplantation to onset of symptoms of acute T . cruzi infection was 112 days ( range , 23 to 420 days ) ( 61 , 66 , 79 , 99 , 101 , 157 , 238 , 279 ) . A relatively severe clinical spectrum has been reported , with manifestations that included fever , malaise , anorexia , hepatosplenomegaly , acute myocarditis , and decreased cardiac function ; two of the 18 reported patients presented with fulminant myocarditis and congestive heart failure ( 61 , 279 ) . Reactivation of chronic T . cruzi infection in organ recipi - ents . Patients with chronic T . cruzi infection can be candidates for organ transplants . In a large cohort of heart transplant patients , survival of those who received the transplant because of chronic Chagas’ cardiomyopathy was longer than survival among those with idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy , and T . cruzi reactivation was a rare cause of death ( 33 , 38 , 39 ) . Reactivation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile episodes and apparent rejection crises . In addition to fever and acute Chagas’ myocarditis in the transplanted heart , common manifestations of reactivation disease include inﬂam - matory panniculitis and skin nodules ( 52 , 102 , 238 ) . Central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement has been reported but is a much less frequent manifestation of reactivation among trans - plant recipients than in AIDS patients ( 5 , 102 , 180 ) . Reactivation Chagas’ disease in HIV / AIDS patients . Reac - tivation of T . cruzi infection in HIV / AIDS patients can cause severe clinical disease with a high risk of mortality . However , as in organ transplant recipients , reactivation is not universal , even in those with low CD4 (cid:1) lymphocyte counts . The only published prospective cohort study followed 53 HIV - T . cruzi - coinfected patients in Brazil for 1 to 190 months ; 11 ( 21 % ) had T . cruzi reactivation diagnosed based on symptoms and / or mi - croscopically detectable parasitemia ( 260 ) . Even among pa - tients without clinical reactivation , the level of parasitemia is higher among HIV - coinfected than among HIV - negative pa - tients ( 261 ) . Symptomatic T . cruzi reactivation in AIDS pa - tients is most commonly reported to cause meningoencepha - litis and / or T . cruzi brain abscesses ; the presentation may be confused with CNS toxoplasmosis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions on imaging or CNS syndromes in AIDS patients ( 70 , 71 , 88 , 260 ) . The second most commonly reported sign of reactivation is acute myocarditis , sometimes superimposed on preexisting chronic Chagas’ car - diomyopathy ( 260 , 297 ) . Patients may present with new arrhythmias , pericardial effusions , acute cardiac decompensa - tion , or accelerated progression of existing chronic heart dis - ease ( 100 , 260 ) . Acute meningoencephalitis and myocarditis can occur simultaneously . In the Brazilian cohort , cardiac reac - tivation was as frequent as CNS disease ; cardiac manifestations of reactivated Chagas’ disease may pass undetected or mimic pro - gression of chronic Chagas’ cardiomyopathy ( 260 ) . Less common manifestations of reactivation in HIV / AIDS patients include skin lesions , erythema nodosum , and parasitic invasion of the perito - neum , stomach , or intestine ( 100 , 261 ) . DIAGNOSIS Appropriate diagnostic testing for T . cruzi infection varies depending on the phase of the disease and the status of the patient . In the United States , CDC provides consultation to health care providers concerning Chagas’ disease diagnostic testing ( contact information is listed in “Antitrypanosomal Drugs” below ) . Diagnosis of Acute T . cruzi Infection In the acute phase , motile trypomastigotes can be detected by microscopy of fresh preparations of anticoagulated blood or buffy coat ( 311 ) . Parasites may also be visualized by microscopy of blood smears stained with Giemsa stain or other stains . Hemoculture in one of several types of standard parasitic me - dium ( e . g . , Novy - MacNeal - Nicolle ) is relatively sensitive dur - ing the acute phase but requires 2 to 4 weeks to show replica - tion . The level of parasitemia decreases within 90 days of infection , even without treatment , and becomes undetectable by microscopy in the chronic phase ( 306 , 311 ) . PCR is a sen - sitive diagnostic tool in the acute phase of Chagas’ disease and may also be used to monitor for acute T . cruzi infection in the recipient of an infected organ or after accidental exposure ( 133 , 134 , 157 ) . Diagnosis of Congenital T . cruzi Infection Early in life , congenital Chagas’ disease is an acute T . cruzi infection and similar diagnostic methods are employed . Con - centration methods yield better sensitivity than direct exami - nation of fresh blood . The microhematocrit method is the most widely used technique in Latin American health facilities . Fresh cord or neonatal blood is collected , sealed in four to six heparinized microhematocrit tubes , and centrifuged , and the buffy coat layer is examined by light microscopy ( 108 ) . Para - sitemia levels rise after birth and peak at or after 30 days of life ( 32 ) . Repeated sampling on several occasions during the ﬁrst months of life increases the sensitivity but may not be accept - able to parents ( 14 , 32 , 197 ) . Hemoculture can increase sensi - tivity , but the technique is not widely available , and results are not available for 2 to 4 weeks . Molecular techniques have higher sensitivity and detect con - genital infections earlier in life than the microhematocrit method ( 32 , 92 , 247 ) . Transient detection of parasite DNA has occasionally been reported in specimens from infants who sub - sequently are found to be uninfected ( 32 , 211 ) . For this reason , a positive PCR on samples collected on two separate occasions may be used as a criterion for conﬁrmation of congenital in - fection ( 32 ) . PCR is increasingly used for the early diagnosis of congenital Chagas’ disease in Latin America and is the method of choice in industrialized countries ( 55 , 140 , 202 , 247 , 266 ) . For infants not diagnosed at birth , conventional IgG serol - ogy ( as outlined below for chronic T . cruzi infection ) is recom - mended after 9 months of age , when transferred maternal antibody has disappeared and the congenital infection has passed into the chronic phase ( 32 , 55 , 56 ) . V OL . 24 , 2011 T . CRUZI AND CHAGAS’ DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES 669 on O c t obe r 27 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / c m r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Diagnosis of Chronic T . cruzi infection Diagnosis of chronic infection relies on serological methods to detect IgG antibodies to T . cruzi , most commonly the en - zyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and immunoﬂuo - rescent - antibody assay ( IFA ) . No single assay has sufﬁcient sensitivity and speciﬁcity to be relied on alone ; two serological tests based on different antigens ( e . g . , whole parasite lysate and recombinant antigens ) and / or techniques ( e . g . , ELISA , IFA , and immunoblotting ) are used in parallel to increase the ac - curacy of the diagnosis ( 311 ) . Inevitably , a proportion of individuals tested by two assays will have discordant serological results and need further testing to resolve their infection status . Specimens with positive results but low antibody titers are more likely to show discordance because results obtained by less sensitive tests may be negative . Published data suggest that the sensitivity of serological assays varies by geographical location , possibly due to T . cruzi strain differences and the resulting antibody responses ( 275 , 293 , 299 ) . The status of some individuals remains difﬁcult to resolve even after a third test , because there is no true gold standard assay for chronic T . cruzi infection ( 283 ) . Assays such as the radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) and trypomastigote excreted - secreted antigen immunoblot ( TESA - blot ) are pro - moted as reference tests , but even these do not have perfect sensitivity and speciﬁcity and may not be capable of resolving the diagnosis ( 168 , 272 ) . Options for diagnostic T . cruzi serological testing are rela - tively limited in the United States . Several ELISA kits based on parasite lysate or recombinant antigens are Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) cleared for diagnostic application . Use of an assay with validation data ( e . g . , a commercial kit shown to have acceptable sensitivity and speciﬁcity in a thorough study ) is preferable to reliance on in - house tests for which no performance data are available ( 31 ) . Utility of PCR for Diagnosis or Monitoring PCR techniques provide the most sensitive tool to diagnose acute - phase and early congenital Chagas’ disease and to mon - itor for acute T . cruzi infection in the recipient of an infected organ or after accidental exposure ( 32 , 65 , 133 ) . PCR assays usually show positive results days to weeks before circulating trypomastigotes are detectable on peripheral blood smears ( 267 ) . Quantitative PCR assays ( e . g . , real - time PCR ) are use - ful to monitor for reactivation in the immunosuppressed T . cruzi - infected host . In these patients , a positive result on con - ventional PCR does not prove reactivation , but quantitative PCR assays that indicate rising parasite numbers over time provide the earliest and most sensitive indicator of reactivation ( 89 , 92 ) . In chronic T . cruzi infection , PCR is used as a research tool but is not generally a useful diagnostic test . Although PCR results will be positive for a proportion of patients , the sensi - tivity is highly variable depending on the characteristics of the population tested , as well as the PCR primers and methods ( 25 , 142 , 314 ) . For these reasons , negative results by PCR do not constitute evidence for lack of infection . TREATMENT Antitrypanosomal Drugs Nifurtimox and benznidazole are the only drugs with proven efﬁcacy against Chagas’ disease ( 73 , 177 ) . Neither drug is ap - proved by the U . S . FDA , but both can be obtained from the CDC and used under investigational protocols . Consulta - tions and drug requests should be addressed to the Parasitic Diseases Public Inquiries line [ ( 404 ) 718 - 4745 ; e - mail , parasites @ cdc . gov ] , the CDC Drug Service [ ( 404 ) 639 - 3670 ] , and , for emergencies after business hours and on weekends and federal holidays , the CDC Emergency Operations Center [ ( 770 ) 488 - 7100 ] . Nifurtimox ( Lampit , Bayer 2502 ) , a nitrofuran , interferes with T . cruzi carbohydrate metabolism by inhibiting pyruvic acid synthesis . Gastrointestinal side effects are common , oc - curring in 30 to 70 % of patients . These include anorexia lead - ing to weight loss , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal discom - fort . Neurological toxicity is also fairly common , including irritability , insomnia , disorientation , and , less often , tremors . Rare but more serious side effects include paresthesias , poly - neuropathy , and peripheral neuritis . The peripheral neuropa - thy is dose dependent , appears late in the course of therapy , and should prompt interruption of treatment . Higher doses are often used in infants than in older children , and tolerance is better in children than in adults . Benznidazole ( Rochagon , Roche 7 - 1051 ) is a nitroimidazole derivative , considered more trypanocidal than nifurtimox . Der - matological side effects are frequent , and consist of rashes due to photosensitization , rarely progressing to exfoliative derma - titis . Severe or exfoliative dermatitis or dermatitis associated with fever and lymphadenopathy should prompt immediate cessation of the drug . The peripheral neuropathy is dose de - pendent , usually occurs late in the course of therapy , and is an indication for immediate cessation of treatment ; it is nearly always reversible but may take months to resolve . Bone mar - row suppression is rare and should prompt immediate inter - ruption of drug treatment . Patients should be monitored for dermatological side effects beginning 9 to 10 days after initia - tion of treatment . Benznidazole was well tolerated in two pla - cebo - controlled trials with children ( 12 % had a rash and (cid:4) 5 % had gastrointestinal symptoms in one study ; (cid:4) 10 % had mod - erate reversible side effects in the other study ) ( 7 , 277 ) . Side effects are more common in adults than in children . Treatment of Acute and Congenital T . cruzi infection In acute and early congenital Chagas’ disease , both drugs reduce the severity of symptoms , shorten the clinical course , and reduce the duration of detectable parasitemia ( 53 , 306 ) . The earliest trials of antitrypanosomal drugs were conducted with patients with acute Chagas’ disease in the 1960s and 1970s using nifurtimox ( 53 , 306 ) . Serological cure was documented at the 12 - month follow - up in 81 % of those treated in the acute phase ( 306 ) . Treatment of Chronic T . cruzi Infection Until recently , only the acute phase , including early congen - ital infection , was thought to be responsive to antiparasitic 670 BERN ET AL . C LIN . M ICROBIOL . R EV . on O c t obe r 27 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / c m r . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m therapy . However , in the 1990s , 2 placebo - controlled trials of benznidazole treatment in children with chronic T . cruzi infec - tion demonstrated approximately 60 % cure as measured by conversion to negative serology 3 to 4 years after the end of treatment ( 7 , 278 ) . Several follow - up studies suggest that the earlier in life that children are treated , the higher the rate of reversion to negative serology ( 6 , 281 ) . Together with growing clinical experience across Latin America , these studies revolu - tionized management of children with Chagas’ disease , making early diagnosis and antitrypanosomal drug therapy the stan - dard of care throughout the region ( 177 , 311 ) . There is currently a growing movement to offer treatment to older patients and those with early cardiomyopathy ( 30 , 302 , 311 ) . In Latin America , most Chagas’ disease experts now believe that the majority of patients with chronic T . cruzi in - fection should be offered treatment , employing individual ex - clusion criteria such as an upper age limit of 50 or 55 years and the presence of advanced irreversible cardiomyopathy ( 276 ) . This change in standards of practice is based in part on non - randomized , nonblinded longitudinal studies that demonstrate decreased progression of Chagas’ cardiomyopathy and de - creased mortality in adult patients treated with benznidazole ( 301 , 302 ) . A multicenter , randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blinded trial of benznidazole for patients with mild to moderate Chagas’ cardiomyopathy is under way and will help to clarify treatment efﬁcacy for this group ( http : / / clinicaltrials . gov / show / NCT00123916 ) . Management of the Immunocompromised Host Antitrypanosomal treatment for reactivation in organ transplant recipients follows standard dosage regimens and promotes resolution of clinical symptoms and parasitemia . There are no data to indicate that prior treatment or post - transplant prophylaxis decreases the risk of reactivation ; posttransplant prophylaxis is not routinely administered in heart transplant centers in Latin America ( 52 ) . Antitrypano - somal therapy is thought to achieve a sterile cure in few , if any , adults with longstanding chronic infection , and treated patients should be considered to be at risk for reactivation . Reactivation in an HIV - coinfected patient should be treated with standard courses of antitrypanosomal treatment ; anti - retroviral therapy should be optimized ( 143 ) . EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CHAGAS’ DISEASE Since 1991 , the estimated global prevalence of T . cruzi in - fection has fallen from 18 million to 8 million , due to intensive vector control and blood bank screening ( 87 , 214 ) . The Pan American Health Organization estimates that approximately 60 , 000 new T . cruzi infections occur each year ( 214 ) . As other transmission routes have diminished , the proportion attribut - able to congenital infection has grown : an estimated 26 % of incident infections now occur through mother - to - child trans - mission ( 214 ) . In settings with endemic vector - borne transmission , T . cruzi infection is usually acquired in childhood . Because the infec - tion is lifelong , the seroprevalence in an area with sustained vector - borne transmission rises with age , reﬂecting the cumu - lative incidence ( 98 ) . Before widespread vector control was instituted in the early 1990s , it was common to ﬁnd that (cid:7) 60 % of adults in an community where the disease was endemic were infected with T . cruzi ( 200 , 230 ) . In cross - sectional community surveys , most infected individuals are asymptomatic ; an esti - mated 70 to 80 % will remain asymptomatic throughout their lives ( 176 , 234 ) . Because cardiac and gastrointestinal manifes - tations usually begin in early adulthood and progress over a period of years to decades , the prevalence of clinical disease increases with increasing age ( 178 ) . HUMAN CHAGAS’ DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES Autochthonous Transmission to Humans Seven autochthonous vector - borne infections ( four in Texas and one each in California , Tennessee , and Louisiana ) have been reported since 1955 ( Table 6 ) ( 10 , 90 , 134 , 151 , 209 , 265 , 342 ) . Most reported cases have been in infants or small chil - dren ; six of the seven infections were in the acute phase at the time of identiﬁcation , and the diagnosis was sought because of symptoms and / or the presence of triatomine vectors . A survey conducted in the community of residence of the 1982 Califor - TABLE 6 .

The rarity of autochtho - nous vector - borne transmission in the United States is as - sumed to result from better housing conditions that mini - mize vector - human contact . In addition , North American vectors may have lower transmission efﬁciency , due at least in part to delayed defecation ( 153 , 203 , 228 ) . However , given that the vast majority of acute T . cruzi infections in immunocompetent individuals pass undiagnosed in Latin America , where the index of suspicion is much higher , un - detected cases of autochthonous vector - borne transmission are presumed to occur . Chagas’ Disease Burden among Latin American Immigrants The only direct assessments in Latin American populations living in the United States come from very limited local surveys and blood bank screening ( see below ) ( 42 , 59 , 148 , 165 , 167 ) . No large representative surveys have ever been conducted , and blood bank data cannot be extrapolated with validity because donors are not representative of the larger population . The only recent data come from a survey of Latin American immi - grants attending churches in Los Angeles County ; a total of 10 ( 1 % ) of 985 adults tested had positive results by serological testing ( 290 ) . Based on the reported number of immigrants from countries in Latin America where Chagas’ disease is endemic and the estimated national T . cruzi seroprevalences in their countries of origin , there are an estimated 300 , 000 per - sons with T . cruzi infection currently living in the United States ( 29 ) . Patients with clinical manifestations of Chagas’ disease , especially cardiomyopathy , are assumed to be present but largely unrecognized in hospitals and health care facilities in the United States , but systematic data are sparse ( 126 ) . Recent targeted studies in a Los Angeles hospital demonstrated pos - itive results by T . cruzi serological tests among 15 ( 16 % ) of 93 Latin American patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic cardio - myopathy and 11 ( 4 . 6 % ) of 239 patients with conduction sys - tem abnormalities on ECG and at least 1 year of residence in Latin America ( 190 , 291 ) . Blood - Borne Transmission and Blood Donor Screening A total of 5 transfusion - associated T . cruzi infections have been documented in the United States since the late 1980s ( Table 7 ) ( 59 , 67 , 114 , 166 , 351 ) . All infected recipients had underlying malignancies and were immunosuppressed . Platelet units from Bolivian donors were implicated in 3 of 5 cases . Several patients had severe manifestations of Chagas’ disease , including acute myocarditis , acute atrioventricular block , se - vere congestive heart failure , pericarditis with T . cruzi in the pericardial ﬂuid , and possible meningoencephalitis ( 67 , 114 , 351 ) . The recipient of a platelet unit detected as infected during a research study had T . cruzi infection detected by PCR and serology during prospective monitoring but never devel - oped symptoms ( 166 ) . In December 2006 , the FDA approved an ELISA to screen for antibodies to T . cruzi in donated blood ( 59 ) . The radioim - munoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) has been used as the conﬁr - matory test ( 1 , 31 , 257 ) . The American Red Cross and Blood Systems Inc . voluntarily began screening all blood donations in January 2007 , and in subsequent months , many other blood centers starting screening as well . As of 2 September 2011 , 1 , 459 conﬁrmed seropositive donations have been detected in 43 states , with the largest numbers found in California , Florida , and Texas ( 1 ) . A second T . cruzi antibody screening test was approved in April 2010 . In December 2010 , FDA issued spe - ciﬁc guidance for appropriate use of the screening tests ( 103 ) . Current FDA recommendations are to screen all blood donors initially , and if a donor’s sample tests negative using one of the two FDA - approved screening tests , no testing of future dona - tions by that donor is necessary . No supplemental test has been approved , and donors are deferred indeﬁnitely on the basis of positive screening test results alone . This strategy will be re - viewed by FDA at upcoming meetings of the Blood Products Advisory Committee ; the risk of newly acquired blood donor infections , including results from longitudinal studies of repeat blood donors , will be considered . Screening of blood donations remains voluntary , although most blood centers are currently following FDA recommendations . In data from the ﬁrst 16 months of screening , comprising TABLE 7 .

Be - cause large blood donor studies prior to FDA approval of the screening ELISA were conducted in southern California with permanent deferral of all repeatedly reactive donors , a sub - stantial number of infected individuals were already removed from the local donor pool , and the reported prevalence in California is thought to represent an underestimate ( 42 , 59 , 165 , 167 ) . From preliminary data , 29 ( 28 % ) of 104 T . cruzi - infected donors were born in Mexico , 27 ( 26 % ) in the United States , 17 ( 16 % ) in El Salvador , and 11 ( 11 % ) in Bolivia ; the remaining 20 donors were born in 9 other countries of Central and South America ( 31 ) . Among conﬁrmed infected donors born in the United States , 10 individuals reported no speciﬁc risk factors for T . cruzi infection . All of these donors reported outdoor activities ( e . g . , hunting , camping , or extensive garden - ing ) in the southern United States , which may indicate poten - tial autochthonous exposure to the vector or animal reservoirs . Organ Donor - Derived Transmission and Organ Donor Screening A total of ﬁve instances of organ - derived transmission from three donors are documented in the published literature in the United States ( Table 8 ) ( 60 , 61 , 157 ) . Four of the ﬁve recipi - ents died . One patient died from acute Chagas’ myocarditis ; T . cruzi infection was not the primary cause of but may have contributed to the other deaths ( 61 , 157 ) . In all of these in - stances of transmission , donor infections were not suspected until at least one recipient presented with symptomatic acute Chagas’ disease ( 60 , 61 , 157 ) . More recently , some organ procurement organizations have begun selective or universal screening of donated organs ( 65 ) . Three transmission events ( in two heart recipients in 2006 and 2010 and one liver recipient in 2006 ) were detected through systematic laboratory monitoring when their respective donors were identiﬁed as infected shortly after the transplants oc - curred . All three of these recipients were treated and survived their T . cruzi infection ( 65 ; S . Huprikar and B . Kubak , unpub - lished data ) . When an infected organ donor is detected , recipient moni - toring relies primarily on detection of the parasite by micros - copy , culture , and / or PCR , because seroconversion may be delayed or never occur in immunocompromised individuals ( 65 , 238 ) . Molecular techniques usually show positive results days to weeks before circulating trypomastigotes are visible by microscopy of peripheral blood . Transplant - transmitted T . cruzi infection may have a longer incubation period than vec - tor - borne infection ; parasitemia is usually detected within 2 to 3 months , but the delay can be as long as 6 months . A fre - quently recommended monitoring schedule consists of weekly specimens for 2 months , specimens every 2 weeks up to 4 months , and then monthly specimens afterwards ( 65 , 238 ) . In the absence of other indications and assuming no evidence of infection has been detected , the monitoring interval can be lengthened after 6 months posttransplantation . Unanswered Questions and Priorities for Research and Programs The United States faces important public health challenges for the prevention , control , and management of T . cruzi infec - tion and Chagas’ disease ( 86 ) . Patients with undiagnosed Cha - gas’ cardiomyopathy go unrecognized , impeding their optimal management . The large number of undetected T . cruzi infec - tions sustains the risk of transmission through blood and organ donation and from mother to child . Currently , obstetricians have limited knowledge of congenital T . cruzi transmission risk , and almost no screening of at - risk women is carried out ( 48 ) . Many health care providers in all specialties fail to consider the diagnosis of Chagas’ disease in patients at risk and are unaware that antitrypanosomal treatment is available ( 280 , 300 ) ; the possibility that treatment could decrease the risk of progres - sion of disease in infected individuals is therefore not realized . Worldwide , programs to control Chagas’ disease are ham - TABLE 8 .

Point - of - care diag - nostic tests would allow physicians to make a rapid diagnosis in patients in whom Chagas’ disease is suspected and provide a practical means to identify women at risk of transmitting the infection to their infants . However , the sensitivity of current T . cruzi rapid tests shows wide geographic variation ( 275 , 299 ) ; there is a need for screening tests with high sensitivity , espe - cially for T . cruzi infections originating in geographic areas such as Mexico and the United States , where current tests appear to have low sensitivity ( 275 ; CDC , unpublished data ) . Two other diagnostic needs are critical : a practical , timely test of cure and indicators to distinguish patients who are likely to develop clinical disease from those likely to remain asymptom - atic . Unfortunately , neither of these tools is currently on the horizon . Pediatric formulations of existing drugs are of imme - diate concern and expected to be available soon ( 91 ) . How - ever , new treatment drugs with high efﬁcacy and better safety proﬁles , especially in adults , are needed ( 295 ) . To inform effective policy for Chagas’ disease control in the United States , signiﬁcant gaps in our knowledge must also be addressed . Systematic , rigorous population - based data to de - termine infection prevalence and morbidity are needed to in - form prevention strategies . Pilot studies in hospitals with a high proportion of women born in Latin America would help to deﬁne practical methods to target screening for congenital transmission . More thorough identiﬁcation of the T . cruzi strains circulating in the United States will add to our assess - ment of transfusion risk and understanding of the molecular epidemiology of the disease ( 164 ) . More comprehensive as - sessment of the magnitude of local transmission risk and the factors inﬂuencing vector and reservoir host distribution and human contact are important to inform control efforts . Im - proved knowledge of the local epidemiology and ecology will allow more efﬁcient , effective targeting of limited resources and raise awareness of Chagas’ disease in the United States . As improved control of vector - and blood - borne T . cruzi transmis - sion decreases the burden in countries where the disease is historically endemic and imported Chagas’ disease is increas - ingly recognized outside Latin America , the United States— which confronts the challenges faced both by countries where the disease is endemic and by those where it is not—can play an important role in addressing the altered epidemiology of Chagas’ disease in the 21st century .
