Probiotics reduce the risk of recurrence of pouchitis , but mechanisms behind these eﬀects are not fully understood . Aim : To examine mucosal barrier function in pouchitis , before and after probiotic supplementation and to assess composition of mucosal pouch microbiota . Methods : Sixteen patients with severe pouchitis underwent endoscopy with biopsies of the pouch on three occasions : during active pouchitis ; clinical remission by 4 weeks of antibiotics ; after 8 weeks of subsequent probiotic supplementation ( Ecologic 825 , Winclove , Amsterdam , the Netherlands ) . Thirteen individuals with a healthy ileoanal pouch were sampled once as controls . Ussing chambers were used to assess transmucosal passage of Escherichia coli K12 , permeability to horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) and 51Cr - EDTA . Composition and diversity of the microbiota was analysed using Human Intestinal Tract Chip . Results : Pouchitis Disease Activity Index ( PDAI ) was signiﬁcantly improved after antibiotic and probiotic supplementation . Escherichia coli K12 passage during active pouchitis [ 3 . 7 ( 3 . 4 – 8 . 5 ) ; median ( IQR ) ] was signiﬁcantly higher than in controls [ 1 . 7 ( 1 . 0 – 2 . 4 ) ; P Conclusions : Probiotics restored the mucosal barrier to E . coli and HRP in patients with pouchitis , a feasible factor in prevention of recurrence during maintenance treatment . Restored barrier function did not translate into signiﬁcant changes in mucosal microbiota composition , but bacterial diversity correlated with barrier function .
