Introduction Studies from recent years have indicated that Rho GTP - ases are preferred targets for a large number of bacterial protein toxins ( Aktories , 1997a ; Schmidt and Aktories , 1998 ) . Reasons for the targeting of Rho GTPases appear to be evident . Rho GTPases are master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and act as molecular switches in vari - ous signaling processes ( Van Aelst and D’Souza - Schorey , 1997 ; Hall , 1998 ) . They regulate migration , adhesion and cell polarity and are involved in the control of transcription , cell cycle progression and transformation . Rho GTPases play key roles in the regulation of secretion , phagocytosis , endocytosis and NADPH oxidase . Thus , the GTPases are involved in the control of cellular responses to extracellu - lar signals in its broadest sense . This is especially true for cells from the immune system , whose signaling responses are essential for host defense mechanisms . However , this is also evident for many cell systems which have barrier functions ( epithelial cells ) or which are otherwise involved in unspecific defense mechanisms . What are the molecu - lar mechanisms by which bacterial protein toxins affect Rho GTPases ? An intriguingly diverse spectrum of molec - ular mechanisms evolved for manipulating the functions of Rho GTPases by bacterial toxins . The functional basis of Rho proteins to act as molecular switches is the GTPase cycle ( Van Aelst and D’Souza - Schorey , 1997 ; Hall , 1998 ; Ridley , 2000 ) . Rho GTPases are inactive when bound to GDP and kept in this form by binding to guanine nu - cleotide dissociation inhibitors ( GDI ) . They are activated by GDP / GTP exchange induced by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and are inactivated by hydrolysis of the bound GTP , a process that is largely facilitated by GAPs ( GTPase - activating proteins ) . Finally , the active Rho GTPases interact with a large spectrum of effector pro - teins to mediate downstream signaling . It appears that Table 1 Toxins Targeting Rho GTPases .

Aktories et al . the bacterial toxins can affect all phases of the GTPase cycle , thereby inactivating or activating Rho GTPases . Rho - Inactivating Toxins Rho GTPases are inactivated by the family of C3 - like ADP - ribosyltransferases , which are produced by several path - ogens including Clostridium botulinum , Clostridium limo - sum , Bacillus cereus , and Staphylococcus aureus ( Akto - ries et al . , 2000 ) ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) . All these transferases are about 25 kDa proteins and are 30 to 70 % identical in their primary structure . C3 - like transferases ADP - ribo - sylate RhoA , B , and C , but not other GTPases of the Rho family like Rac and Cdc42 . The modification occurs at Asn41 ( Sekine et al . , 1989 ) , which is located in the switch - I region of Rho . Although it has been known for some time that ADP - ribosylation blocks the biological activity of the GTPases ( Paterson et al . , 1990 ) the precise mechanism is not completely understood . ADP - ribosyla - tion has only minor effects on the nucleotide binding and GTPase activity of Rho ( Sehr et al . , 1998 ) . Moreover , ADP - ribosylated Rho is still able to bind effectors such as protein kinase N ( Sehr et al . , 1998 ) . However , effector acti - vation is apparently disturbed ( Figure 2 ) . This was shown recently by the inability of ADP - ribosylated Rho to activate Fig . 2 Rho GTPases Are Inactive in the GDP - Bound State and Complexed with the Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor GDI . Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEF ) cause the release of GDP and binding of GTP , thereby activating Rho proteins . The ac - tive state of Rho GTPases is turned off by GTP hydrolysis stimu - lated by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAP ) . The ‘injected’ toxin SopE acts like a GEF protein to activate Rho . C3 toxins ADP - ri - bosylate Rho at Asn41 , thereby blocking their activation by GEF . ADP - ribosylated Rho interacts with effectors ; however , the acti - vation of effectors appears to be impaired . The family of large clostridial toxins glucosylates Rho GTPases at Thr37 / 35 . The main functional consequence is the inhibition of the interaction of Rho with effectors . In addition , glucosylation blocks activation by GEF , stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by GAP and interaction with GDI . CNF and DNT deamidate and transglutaminate Rho pro - teins at Gln63 / 61 , respectively . Thereby the intrinsic and GAP - stimulated GTP - hydrolyzing activity is blocked and Rho proteins become constitutively active . SptP , ExoS and YopE turn off the active state of Rho GTPases by acting as GAP proteins . Fig . 1 List of Rho Targeting Toxins . Upper panel : Rho - inactivating toxins . The large clostridial cyto - toxins consist of at least 3 main domains . Domain I harbors the glucosyltransferase activity , domain II might be involved in trans - location and domain III is suggested to be responsible for recep - tor binding . C3 - like ADP - ribosyltransferases only consist of the catalytic domain . ExoS , SptP and YopE are delivered into the tar - get cell by type - III secretion and possess an N - terminal region to allow translocation by this system . All three proteins harbor a GAP domain to turn off the active Rho state . In addition , ExoS contains a GAP - independent C - terminal ADP - ribosyltransferase domain to modify Ras , and SptP has a C - terminal tyrosine phosphatase domain . Lower panel : Rho - activating toxins . The Rho - deamidas - es CNF 1 and 2 and the Rho - transglutaminase DNT may consists of three domains . The enzyme domains are located at the C - ter - minus . The binding and translocation domains are located at the N - terminus and in the central part of the proteins , respectively . SopE , which is delivered into the target cells by a type III - system , is a GEF for Rho GTPases and carries a region for interaction with the translocation system at its N - terminus . phospholipase D ( Genth et al . , submitted ) . Furthermore , it was observed , that the activation of Rho is significantly affected by ADP - ribosylation ( Sehr et al . , 1998 ) . Stimula - tion of the GTP / GDP exchange of Rho by the Rho - specif - ic GEF protein Lbc is completely blocked . Moreover , stud - ies on the interaction of ADP - ribosylated Rho with GDI suggest a disturbed release of the GTPase from the GDI protein . Since it is suggested that Rho has to be released from GDI to be activated by GEFs , the enhanced binding to GDI prevents the activating nucleotide exchange . Rho GTPases are also inactivated by toxin - catalyzed glucosylation ( Just et al . , 1995a , b ; von Eichel - Streiber et al . , 1996 ; Aktories , 1997b ) . These toxins belong to the family of large clostridial cytotoxins with the prototypes Clostridium difficile toxin A and B , which are the major vir - ulence factors of the antibiotic - associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis . The toxins have molecular masses of 250 – 308 kDa and share 25 to 70 % amino acid sequence identity . The toxins differ in their substrate and cosubstrate specificity . Whereas Clostridium difficile tox - in A and B , Clostridium sordellii hemorrhagic toxin and Clostridium novyi (cid:2) - toxin modify Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 , and most likely all Rho subfamily GTPases ( Just et al . , 1995a ; Selzer et al . , 1996 ) , C . sordellii lethal toxin and sub - types of C . difficile toxin B ( toxin B type 1470 and type 8864 ) glucosylate Rac and to minor extent Cdc42 , but not Rho ( Just et al . , 1996 ; Popoff et al . , 1996 ; Chaves - Olarte et al . , 1999 ) . The latter toxins are also capable of modifying Ras subfamily proteins . With the exception of C . novyi (cid:2) - toxin the cosubstrate of all these toxins is UDP - glucose . C . novyi (cid:2) - toxin uses UDP - GlcNAc as a cosubstrate . All large clostridial toxins modify Rho / Ras proteins at Thr37 of Rho or at the equivalent Thr35 of Rac / Cdc42 / Ras . This residue has a pivotal role in the co - ordination of the Mg 2 + ion and binding of guanine nucleotides . Because the hy - droxyl group of Thr35 / 37 is directed toward the surface of the Rho proteins only in the GDP - bound form of the GT - Pase , the toxins exclusively modify GDP - Rho proteins but not GTPases in their GTP - bound form . Since Thr35 / 37 is functionally essential for the GTPase , its glucosylation im - plicates multiple consequences . Whereas glucosylation does not affect spontaneous nucleotide dissociation ( this is true for both GDP and GTP ) , intrinsic and GAP - stimu - lated GTPase activities are blocked , the nucleotide ex - change induced by Lbc is inhibited and , most importantly , the interaction of the glucosylated Rho / Ras GTPases with effectors is blocked ( Herrmann et al . , 1998 ; Sehr et al . , 1998 ) . Moreover , recent studies indicate that the GTPase cycling between the cytosol and the membrane is inhibit - ed by glucosylation ( Genth et al . , 1999 ) . It was shown that glucosylated Rho does no longer bind to GDI but exhibits an increased membrane binding activity . It remains to be clarified whether this inhibition of cytosol / membrane cycling participates in the toxin - induced inhibition of the biological function of Rho proteins . ‘Injected’ Rho - Inactivating Toxins The above mentioned glucosylating toxins are released from the bacteria into the environment , and their intracel - lular actions depend on complex cell binding and translo - cation mechanisms . Recently , it was shown that several bacteria modulate the signaling and metabolism of eu - karyotic target cells by a different mechanism . They di - rectly inject biologically active proteins into the eukaryotic cell by means of the type - III secretion system , which depends on the physical interaction of bacteria with the target cell ( Galán and Bliska , 1996 ) . Several of the injected bacterial proteins affect the actin cytoskeleton . Evidence was presented that the injected toxins act on Rho regula - tory pathway ( Pederson et al . , 1999 ) . More recent studies revealed that also the ‘injected’ toxins directly affect Rho GTPases . The first injected toxin , which was recognized to inactivate Rho GTPases , was SptP from Salmonella ( Fu and Galán , 1999 ) . The SptP protein consists of two domains : its C - terminus harbors tyrosine phosphatase activity , while the N - terminus , which shares sequence similarities with the Yersinia YopE protein and with ExoS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa , was recently shown to possess GAP activity for Rac and Cdc42 ( Kaniga et al . , 1996 ) . Subsequently , it was demonstrated that the N - ter - minal part of ExoS and YopE share the GTPase - activating activity ( Goehring et al . , 1999 ; von Pawel - Rammingen et al . , 2000 ) . ExoS and YopE stimulate the GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by Rho , Rac and Cdc42 . Sequence alignments and subsequent site - directed mutagenesis revealed an essential arginine residue in all these bacterial GAP pro - teins , which most likely has the function of an arginine fin - ger known to be essential for GAP activity of the respective eukaryotic proteins . Recently , another Yop protein was identified to modify Rho . YopT , which is able to decrease the amount of stress fibers of host cells , causes a down - ward shift of RhoA in SDS - PAGE , indicating a covalent modification of the GTPase . Up to now neither the type of modification nor its precise functional consequences are known ( Zumbihl et al . , 1999 ) . Rho - Activating Toxins The cytotoxic necrotizing factors CNF1 and 2 from E . coli are about 115 kDa proteins which were shown to induce necrotic lesions after subcutaneous application ( Capri - oli et al . , 1983 ; de Rycke et al . , 1990 ) . In cultured cells , these toxins induce formation of stress fibers , membrane ruffling and multinucleation ( Oswald et al . , 1994 ; Fiorentini et al . , 1995 ) . After treatment of cells with CNF , Rho mi - grates slower in SDS - PAGE , indicating a covalent modifi - cation of the GTPase ( Oswald et al . , 1994 ) . Analysis of CNF - treated Rho showed a deamidation of Gln63 of Rho , resulting in glutamic acid ( Flatau et al . , 1997 ; Schmidt et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , CNFs possess deamidation activity to selectively modify Gln63 which is essential for GTP hydro - lysis catalyzed by Rho . The functional consequence of the Rho GTPases as Toxin Targets 423 424 K . Aktories et al . deamidation of Rho at Gln63 is the constitutive activation of the GTPase , resulting in the induction of stress fiber for - mation and activation of signaling pathways Rho proteins are involved in . Not only RhoA but also Rac and Cdc42 are deamidated by CNFs . Moreover , studies with Rho / Ras chimeras ( the latter GTPase is not a substrate of CNF ) re - vealed that only a small region of the Rho GTPases cover - ing the switch - II region is essential for modification by CNF ( Lerm et al . , 1999 ) . Accordingly , a Ras / Rho chimeric protein that consists of Rho sequences in the switch - II re - gion of Ras induced the formation of neurites after mi - croinjected into PC12 cells and concomitant treatment of cells with CNF1 . Thus , Ras was activated by CNF through a built - in Rho switch . Similar to CNFs , the dermonecrotizing toxin DNT from Bordetella species possesses deamidating activity ( Hori - guchi et al . , 1997 ) . DNT is an approx . 160 kDa protein sharing sequence similarity with CNF in its C - terminal part which harbors the catalytic activity ( Walker and Weiss , 1994 ; Lemichez et al . , 1997 ) . However , DNT differs in sev - eral aspects from CNFs . In contrast to CNF , DNT modifies Rho GTPases in a nucleotide - dependent manner ( Hori - guchi et al . , 1997 ; Schmidt et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , Rho GTP - ases are modified by DNT in the GDP - bound form but not with GTP bound . This points to more specific substrate re - quirements of DNT as compared to CNF . Accordingly , a peptide of the switch - II region of Rho is modified by CNF but not by DNT . Moreover , another major difference be - tween DNT and CNF has been reported : DNT appears to act not only as a deamidase but also as a transglutami - nase ( Schmidt et al . , 1999 ) . It is able to attach primary amines such as spermine , spermidine , or ethylenediamine onto Gln63 of Rho . This transglutaminase activity was first reported with isolated Rho proteins , but recently it was also observed in intact cells ( Masuda et al . , 2000 ) . When C3 H10T1 / 2 cells were pretreated with [ 14 C ] putrescine to metabolically label spermidine and spermine , radiola - beled Rho proteins were detected after treatment of the cells with DNT . Similar to the deamidation of Gln63 of Rho , the DNT - catalyzed transglutamination of Rho with poly - amines blocked the intrinsic and GAP - stimulated GTP hydrolysis . The polyaminated Rho exhibited higher affinity for the effector ROCK - I and bound to the Rho - binding do - main even in the presence of GDP . Because DNT and CNF share conserved amino acid residues in the C - terminal catalytic domain , it was tested whether CNF possesses transglutaminase activity . These studies showed that CNF was able to transglutaminate Rho in the presence of polyamines ; however , this type of modification occurred only to a minor extend ( Schmidt et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) . To fur - ther compare the enzyme activities of CNF and DNT , the release of ammonia from Rho was studied in the presence and absence of ethylenediamine . Whereas significant am - monia production was observed with DNT only in the pres - ence of the diamine , CNF caused ammonia production in the absence of the primary amine . Most importantly , the ammonia production was not increased by the addition of ethylenediamine . Thus , whereas CNF is a deamidase , DNT acts primarily as a transglutaminase . Several euka - ryotic transglutaminases are known that are characterized by low substrate specificity , accepting a large array of pro - teins as substrates ( Aeschlimann and Paulsson , 1994 ) . In contrast , DNT does not transglutaminate typical tissue transglutaminase substrates such as actin or casein , but is specific for Rho GTPases . Injected Rho - Activating Toxins Salmonella typhimurium is able to induce macropinocyto - sis , which finally results in internalization of the bacteria into host cells . This process is initiated by a dramatic membrane ruffling and redistribution of the actin cy - toskeleton ( Galán and Bliska , 1996 ) . As mentioned above , Salmonella targets eukaryotic cells by injecting toxins us - ing the type - III secretion system . One of these injected toxins is SopE . The transient expression or microinjection of this protein into cultured cells induces membrane ruf - fling , actin rearrangements and activation of Jun kinase . Recently , it was shown that SopE is a Rho GEF protein that induces nucleotide exchange and activation of the GT - Pase ( Hardt et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , Salmonella injects Rho - af - fecting proteins into the target cells which act in an antag - onistic manner , e . g . , activating Rac / Cdc42 / Rho by SopE and inactivating Rac / Cdc42 by SptP . However , the inject - ed toxins may act on Rho proteins in a sequential manner to manipulate the activity of Rho GTPases on cytoskeleton restructuring and signaling events . The identification of SopE and SptP of Salmonella is in full agreement with the transient formation of membrane ruffles followed by the normalization of the cytoskeleton of the target cells within a short period of time ( Fu and Galán , 1999 ) . Conclusions Several bacterial toxins including ‘injected’ toxins , act on Rho proteins to inactivate and activate the GTPases . These toxins are of major interest because they are impor - tant virulence factors that are basically involved in the on - set and maintenance of infection and cause of disease . Precise knowledge of the actions of these toxins will cer - tainly help to understand the pathogenicity of the infec - tious diseases that are caused by the toxin - producing pathogens . Moreover , the unique selectivity and potency of the toxins is the basis for their usage as biological tools to study the signaling pathways of Rho GTPases in eu - karyotic cells .
