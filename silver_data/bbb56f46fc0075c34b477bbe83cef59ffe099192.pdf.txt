RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by the FAK - Src complex at focal adhesions regulates cell motility Wenqi Wang , Yang Liu and Kan Liao * Abstract Background : Cell migration plays an important role in many physiological and pathological processes , including immune cell chemotaxis and cancer metastasis . It is a coordinated process that involves dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton and its interplay with focal adhesions . At the leading edge of a migrating cell , it is the re - arrangement of actin and its attachment to focal adhesions that generates the driving force necessary for movement . However , the mechanisms involved in the attachment of actin filaments to focal adhesions are still not fully understood . Results : Signaling by the FAK - Src complex plays a crucial role in regulating the formation of protein complexes at focal adhesions to which the actin filaments are attached . Cortactin , an F - actin associated protein and a substrate of Src kinase , was found to interact with FAK through its SH3 domain and the C - terminal proline - rich regions of FAK . We found that the autophosphorylation of Tyr 397 in FAK , which is necessary for FAK activation , was not required for the interaction with cortactin , but was essential for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the associated cortactin . At focal adhesions , cortactin was phosphorylated at tyrosine residues known to be phosphorylated by Src . The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and its ability to associate with the actin cytoskeleton were required in tandem for the regulation of cell motility . Cell motility could be inhibited by truncating the N - terminal F - actin binding domains of cortactin or by blocking tyrosine phosphorylation ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482F mutation ) . In addition , the mutant cortactin phosphorylation mimic ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482E ) had a reduced ability to interact with FAK and promoted cell motility . The promotion of cell motility by the cortactin phosphorylation mimic could also be inhibited by truncating its N - terminal F - actin binding domains . Conclusions : Our results suggest that cortactin acts as a bridging molecule between actin filaments and focal adhesions . The cortactin N - terminus associates with F - actin , while its C - terminus interacts with focal adhesions . The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by the FAK - Src complex modulates its interaction with FAK and increases its turnover at focal adhesions to promote cell motility . Keywords : cortactin , cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , FAK , FAK - Src complex , focal adhesions , cell motility Background Src is a non - receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase acti - vated by integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases [ 1 ] . In normal cells , Src is involved in a vast range of physiolo - gical functions , including cell proliferation , cytoskeletal regulation , cell shape control , cell - matrix adhesion dynamics and motility [ 2 , 3 ] . In many types of human cancer , Src is overexpressed or hyperactivated [ 4 , 5 ] . The prominent role of Src in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility makes the study of Src indis - pensable in understanding cancer cell migration and invasion . Initially identified as a tyrosine - phosphorylated protein in v - Src infected chicken embryo fibroblasts [ 6 ] , cortac - tin is a direct substrate of cellular Src kinase [ 7 ] . It is phosphorylated by Src at three tyrosine residues ( Tyr 421 , * Correspondence : kliao @ sibs . ac . cn State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology , Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Shanghai 200031 , China Wang et al .

The phosphory - lation of Tyr 475 was identified by a mass spectrometry study [ 9 ] . These tyrosine phosphorylation sites reside in the proline - rich region , which is the least conserved domain in cortactin from different species [ 10 ] . Many studies have suggested that cortactin and its tyr - osine phosphorylation regulate lamellipodial protrusion , cell spreading , intercellular adhesion and cell motility [ 11 - 13 ] . Src - catalyzed cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in integrin - mediated cell adhesion and spreading [ 14 ] . Cortactin knockdown in murine fibro - blasts impairs both random and directional cell migra - tion [ 15 ] . The expression of cortactin mutated at Src phosphorylation sites ( Y421 / 466 / 482F ) decreases cell motility in ECV304 endothelial cells [ 8 ] . The impaired cell motility in cortactin knockdown gastric cancer cell lines , with a low cortactin phosphorylation level , can be rescued by the ectopic expression of wild - type cortactin , but not by the mutant cortactin ( Y421 / 466 / 482F ) [ 16 ] . Early studies revealed that cortactin colocalizes with F - actin in the cortical structures of adherent cells [ 7 , 17 ] . It associates with the F - actin cytoskeleton through the F - actin binding tandem cortactin repeats and the N - term - inal acidic domain that interacts with the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex for dendritic actin nucleation [ 10 , 18 , 19 ] . At the cell periphery , the F - actin cytoskeleton forms a highly organized meshwork that controls mem - brane protrusion and regulates cell motility [ 20 , 21 ] . During cell migration , the propelling force is generated by membrane protrusions and by membrane - matrix adhesions , called focal adhesions , at which transmem - brane integrins link the extracellular matrix to the intra - cellular actin cytoskeleton [ 22 ] . In contrast to the cortactin that colocalizes with F - actin at cortical regions , tyrosine phosphorylated cor - tactin ( pTyr 421 , 466 , 482 ) is almost exclusively localized at focal adhesions [ 16 , 23 ] . It is colocalized with paxillin and vinculin at the ends of F - actin stress fibers [ 16 , 23 ] . At focal adhesions , the clustered integrins recruit FAK and facilitate its activation , forming an active FAK - Src complex that initiates many intracellular signaling events [ 24 - 27 ] . The autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 creates a high affinity binding site for the Src - homology 2 domain of Src kinase [ 28 ] . The binding of Src to FAK leads to the formation of an active FAK - Src complex in which the active Src kinase trans - phos - phorylates FAK at Tyr 576 , 577 for maximal FAK cataly - tic activity [ 29 ] . FAK recruits adaptor proteins and signaling molecules into focal adhesions , at which many are phosphorylated by the FAK - Src complex . The N - terminal FERM domain binds to growth factor receptors , the C - terminal FAT domain interacts with talin and paxillin , and the pro - line - rich regions recruit Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain - containing proteins , such as p130Cas , GRAF and ASAP1 [ 26 , 30 ] . In this study , we report that cortactin interacted with FAK at focal adhesions at which it is phosphorylated by the FAK - Src complex . Cortactin helps mediate the asso - ciation of F - actin with focal adhesions . Its N - terminus interacts with F - actin , and its C - terminus associates with FAK . The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by the FAK - Src complex reduces its interaction with FAK , most likely to increase its turnover at focal adhesions to promote cell motility . Results Colocalization of tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin and the active FAK - Src complex at focal adhesions Cortactin , Src and actin are colocalized at the leading edge of lamellipodia in several types of cells , including COS7 cells ( Figure 1A ) [ 11 ] . In contrast , the tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin ( at Src kinase site Tyr 421 ) clustered into dots , which were localized to focal adhe - sions marked by paxillin ( Figure 1D ) [ 23 ] . The phos - phorylated cortactin at focal adhesions was phosphorylated at all three Src kinase sites ( Tyr 421 , 466 , 482 ) ( Figure 2A ) ( the information about these antibo - dies is provided in the Methods section ) . It could be dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase . No signal was detected by antibodies against phosphorylated cor - tactin in alkaline phosphatase - treated cells ( Figure 2A ) . In addition , the active Src kinase ( phosphorylated at Tyr 418 ) was also colocalized with focal adhesions ( Fig - ure 1D ) . The kinase and its product of phosphorylated cortactin were colocalized at focal adhesions to which actin stress fibers were attached . Cortactin and its phosphorylated forms had very dif - ferent cellular distribution pattern in cell , implicating additional functions for phosphorylated cortactin ( Figure 1E ) . At the lamellipodial leading edge , cortactin and its tyrosine phosphorylated forms had a different localiza - tion ( Figure 1A and 1B ) . Cortactin traced the lamellipo - dial edge . However , phosphorylated cortactin dotted the edge and was colocalized with paxillin and Tyr 418 - phos - phorylated Src at the newly formed focal contacts ( Fig - ure 1B and 1C ) . During cell - matrix interactions , the clustering of integrins forms focal contacts , and then focal adhesions , at the leading edge of the lamellipodia [ 31 ] . At focal adhesions , Src binds to Tyr 397 - phosphory - lated FAK to form an active FAK - Src complex ( Figure 1C and 1D ) [ 26 , 28 ] . The colocalization of tyrosine phos - phorylated cortactin with Tyr 418 - phosphorylated Src at focal adhesions implicates Src in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions ( Figure 1D ) . It was further supported by the colocalization of phosphory - lated cortactin with Tyr 397 - autophosphorylated FAK ( Figure 2B ) . Wang et al .

Cortactin was clustered with FAK at newly formed focal adhesions at the leading lamelli - podial edge of migrating cells ( Figure 3A ) .

As shown in Figure 4C , only the cortactin C - terminus interacted with FAK . There was no interaction between the cortactin N - terminal F - actin binding domains and FAK . The cortactin C - terminus contains two important functional domains : the proline - rich region containing Src kinase phosphorylation sites and the SH3 domain ( 7 - 10 ) . The cortactin SH3 domain participates in the interaction with FAK . In GST pulldown experiments , the deletion of the SH3 domain reduced , but did not completely block , the interaction with FAK ( Figure 4E ) . Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation was not required for the interaction with FAK , but it regulated their interac - tion . The phosphorylation - incompetent cortactin ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482F ) bound FAK , similar to wild - type cortac - tin ( Figure 4D ) . However , the cortactin phosphorylation mimic ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482E ) exhibited a much weaker association with FAK ( Figure 4D ) . Thus , both the pro - line - rich region and the SH3 domain at the cortactin C - terminus were important for the cortactin - FAK interaction . The autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 is essential for the binding to Src to form the FAK - Src complex . To determine if Src in the FAK - Src complex mediates the interaction between cortactin and FAK , Tyr 397 in FAK was mutated . Exogenous GFP - tagged FAK was expressed in COS7 cells and was found to localize to focal adhesions ( Figure 3B ) . In the GST pull - down assay , the GFP - tagged FAK and the GFP - tagged FAK mutant ( Y397F ) exhibited no difference in their associa - tion with GST - cortactin ( Figure 4F ) , indicating that the interaction between cortactin and FAK is not mediated by Src . Of the several functional domains in FAK , the cortac - tin - interaction domain resides in proline - rich regions 2 and 3 ( Figure 4B and 4G ) .

This suggests that the interaction between cortactin and FAK is mediated by the C - terminal domains of cortactin and proline - rich regions 2 and 3 of FAK , and that it is regulated by cor - tactin tyrosine phosphorylation . Cell adhesion induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions Cell adhesion induces the formation of the FAK - Src complex , which leads to the phosphorylation of various FAK - associated proteins [ 26 ] . During the adhesion of suspended HEK293 cells in a fibronectin - coated dish , FAK autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of FAK - associated p130Cas were both increased ( Figure 5A ) . As a FAK associated protein , cortactin was also phosphorylated on tyrosine residues during this cell adhesion process ( Figure 5B ) . The co - immunoprecipita - tion of FAK and its autophosphorylated form from adherent cells using an anti - cortactin antibody demon - strates the association of tyrosine phosphorylated cortac - tin with the FAK - Src complex ( Figure 5C ) . During the initial stage of cell adhesion and spreading , FAK , cortactin and actin were all colocalized at the edge of the membrane ( Figure 5D ) . Cell adhesion induced FAK clustering and focal adhesion formation . FAK at focal adhesions was autophosphorylated ( Figure 5D and 5E ) . In these adherent cells , cortactin was still primarily localized to the cell cortex , and cortactin clustering could only be observed at newly formed focal contacts at the leading edge of the lamellipodia ( Figure 3A and 5D ) . However , cortactin was tyrosine phosphorylated at focal adhesions ( Figure 2 and 5E ) . The tyrosine phos - phorylation of cortactin might decrease its interaction with FAK , because the cortactin phosphorylation mimic ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482E ) exhibited a much weaker associa - tion with FAK ( Figure 4D ) . FAK - Src complex is required for cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions To examine the function of the FAK - Src complex in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , FAK was knocked down by RNA interference in COS7 cells ( Figure 5G and 5H ) . Cortactin expression was not affected by FAK knockdown , but cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation was greatly reduced ( Figure 5G ) . Because focal adhesions can still form in FAK - deficient cells [ 32 ] , cortactin tyro - sine phosphorylation at focal adhesions in FAK knock - down COS7 cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining . As shown in Figure 5H , cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected at focal adhesions . In contrast , cortactin knockdown by RNA interference had no effect on FAK or its autophosphorylation ( Figure 5F ) . Thus , these results suggest that at focal adhesions cor - tactin interacts with FAK , which is required for cortac - tin tyrosine phosphorylation . FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr 397 is essential for the formation of the FAK - Src complex . By mutating Tyr 397 of FAK into Phe , the formation of the FAK - Src complex at focal adhesions can be disrupted [ 26 ] . In the GFP - tagged FAK ( Y397F ) mutant , autophosphorylation at Tyr 397 was abolished and Src - catalyzed Tyr 576 phosphorylation was inhibited ( Figure 5I ) . However , the interaction of FAK with cortactin was not affected by the mutation at Tyr 397 in GST pull - down experiments ( Figure 4F ) , and the Tyr 397 - mutated FAK , overexpressed in COS7 cells , could be co - immunoprecipitated with cortactin by the anti - cor - tactin antibody ( Figure 5J ) . Although cortactin could still interact with the mutant FAK , the mutation disrupted the interaction between FAK and Src , leading to a decrease in cortactin phosphorylation . Tyrosine phosphorylation in cortactin immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells overex - pressing the mutant GFP - tagged FAK ( Y397F ) was drama - tically reduced ( Figure 5J ) . Thus , it appears that cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions requires the formation of the FAK - Src complex . To determine whether cortactin is phosphorylated by FAK or by Src in the FAK - Src complex , cortactin tyro - sine phosphorylation was analyzed in HEK293 cells overexpressing GFP - tagged FAK , Src or both . The results of this experiment suggest that cortactin was phosphorylated by Src ( Figure 6A ) . Furthermore , cortac - tin tyrosine phosphorylation could be promoted by expressing the constitutively active Src , but not the inac - tive Src . And mutating the Src phosphorylation sites in cortactin ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482F ) inhibited Src - catalyzed cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Figure 6B ) . The activation of Src in the FAK - Src complex was designated by an increase in Tyr 418 - phosphorylated Src following cell adhesion ( results not shown ) . Src was recruited to focal adhesions by Tyr 397 - autophosphory - lated FAK to form the FAK - Src complex during cell adhesion ( Figure 6C ) . Although cortactin interacted with FAK at focal adhesions , it was phosphorylated by Src kinase in the FAK - Src complex . In cells overexpressing active Src , most cortactin was phosphorylated and recruited to cortical focal adhesions ( Figure 6D and 6E ) . In these cells , cortactin and its phosphorylated form were well co - localized . In contrast , the expression of inactive Src did not affect cortactin phosphorylation or the formation of focal adhesions ( Figure 6E ) . Cell motility is regulated by FAK - Src complex - catalyzed cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation The FAK - Src complex holds the center stage in the reg - ulation of cell motility [ 26 ] .

In HT1080 cells , FAK knockdown by RNA interference inhibited cell migration , as did inhibiting Src kinase activity with PP2 ( Figure 7A , B and 7C ) . In addition , overexpressing the GFP - tagged FAK mutant ( Y397F ) , which prevents for - mation of the FAK - Src complex , also inhibited cell migration ( Figure 7D ) . As a substrate of the FAK - Src complex , cortactin was involved in regulating cell moti - lity . Cortactin knockdown in HT1080 cells by RNA interference inhibited cell migration ( Figure 7A and 7E ) . Cortactin interacted with FAK and was phosphory - lated by the FAK - Src complex ( Figures 4 and 6 ) . To investigate the role of FAK - Src complex - catalyzed cor - tactin tyrosine phosphorylation in cell motility , the phosphorylation sites in cortactin were mutated into Phe residues ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482F ) to block tyrosine phosphorylation .

The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by the FAK - Src complex most likely promotes its dissociation from FAK because the interaction between the cortactin phosphorylation mimic and FAK was greatly reduced ( Figure 4D ) . The phosphorylation - incompetent cortactin mutant ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482F ) formed a stable interaction with FAK , and cell migration was inhibited . In contrast , the cortactin phosphorylation mimic exhibited increased turnover at focal adhesions ( Figure 4D ) [ 34 ] , greatly enhancing cell migration ( Figure 8A and 8B ) .

Taken together , these results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin regulates cell motility by increasing cortactin turnover at focal adhesions .

With - out these domains , the remaining cortactin C - terminus could still interact with FAK and could be phosphory - lated by the FAK - Src complex ( Figures 4C and 6B ) . However , cell migration was inhibited by overexpressing the cortactin C - terminus in HT1080 cells ( Figure 8A and 8B ) . In addition , overexpressing the C - terminus of the cortactin phosphorylation mimic also inhibited cell migration ( Figure 8A and 8B ) . Thus , the C - termini of cortactin and the phosphorylation mimic interfere with the ability of native cortactin to regulate cell migration . The tyrosine phosphorylation of the cortactin C - termi - nus was essential for its inhibitory effect on cell migra - tion . Cell migration was not inhibited by the phosphorylation - incompetent cortactin C - terminus ( Fig - ure 8A and 8B ) . The presence of the non - phosphory - lated cortactin C - terminus did not affect the function of phosphorylated cortactin . In summary , the increased turnover of the cortactin phosphorylation mimic at focal adhesions increased F - actin dynamics and promoted cell migration . The stable association of the phosphoryla - tion - incompetent cortactin at focal adhesions reduced F - actin dynamics and inhibited cell migration . Truncat - ing the N - terminal F - actin binding domains did not affect F - actin dynamics . The stable association of the phosphorylation - incompetent cortactin C - terminus at focal adhesions appears to be independent of F - actin dynamics and then had no effect on cell motility . How - ever , the mechanism by which the C - terminus of the cortactin phosphorylation mimic interferes with cellular phosphorylated cortactin and inhibits cell migration requires further study . Discussion At focal adhesions , Src and FAK form an active kinase complex to phosphorylate associated proteins . The iden - tification of cortactin , a Src kinase substrate and F - actin associated protein [ 10 ] , as a FAK interactor at focal adhesions suggests that FAK - Src - catalyzed cortactin tyr - osine phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of cell motility ( Figure 4 ) . Src was the first oncogene to be discovered and is one of the most intensely studied [ 1 - 3 ] . In cancer cells , active Src not only increases cell growth and survival , but also promotes actin cytoskele - ton reorganization and decreases cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesions to facilitate motility and invasiveness [ 1 , 3 ] . Cortactin is frequently overexpressed in malignant tumors and there is a correlation between cortactin phosphorylation and enhanced cell migration and metastasis [ 35 , 36 ] . Cortactin and its tyrosine phosphory - lation are involved in adhesion - dependent cell edge pro - trusion [ 37 ] . Cortactin is phosphorylated by Src at the leading edge of lamellipodia , where in association with the Arp2 / 3 complex , it initiates the branching of actin filaments to promote the formation of membrane pro - trusions [ 36 , 38 ] . The overexpression of constitutively active Src appears to induce cortactin phosphorylation and membrane protrusions at the edge ( Figure 6D and 6E ) . Cell migration and invasion are essential elements of cancer metastasis . During cancer cell invasion , cortac - tin is one of the proteins that direct actin bundles to form invadopodia [ 39 ] . The involvement of Src - cata - lyzed cortactin phosphorylation in cell motility control suggests cortactin might be a crucial regulator of cancer metastasis . For cell migration , the turnover of the cytoskeleton at focal adhesions is more important than stable associa - tion . To propel cell movement , the dynamic interplay between the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion sites induces membrane protrusions and generates traction force . The external force exerted on the cell and the internal force generated by the F - actin cytoskeleton dur - ing cell migration are anchored and sensed at focal adhesions , particularly by the FAK - Src complex [ 32 , 40 ] . One method of cell motility control by the FAK - Src complex is the phosphorylation of FAK associated pro - teins such as paxillin and p130Cas [ 40 ] . Mutating the FAK - Src phosphorylation sites in paxillin ( Tyr 31 , 118 ) inhibits the turnover of focal adhesions and reduces cell motility [ 41 ] . Cortactin is phosphorylated by the FAK - Src complex at C - terminal tyrosine residues ( Tyr 421 , 466 , 475 , 482 ; Figure 6 ) [ 8 , 9 ] . The structural configuration of cortactin , which contains N - terminal F - actin binding domains and C - terminal FAK association domains , enables it to mediate the association between the F - actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions ( Figure 4 ) [ 19 ] . By regulating the interaction between the cortactin C - terminus and FAK , cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is able to control the association or dissociation of F - actin at focal adhesions . This hypothesis is supported by the results of the phosphorylation - incompetent cortactin mutant ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482F ) and its N - terminal domain truncated form . Blocking tyrosine phosphorylation by mutating Tyr into Phe ( Y421 / 466 / 475 / 482F ) stabilizes the interaction of cortactin with FAK , decreases the turnover of F - actin at focal adhesions and inhibits cell migration ( Figure 4D and 8 ) . By truncating the N - term - inal F - actin binding domains , the remaining cortactin C - terminus can no longer interact with F - actin . Its associa - tion or dissociation at focal adhesions has no effect on F - actin dynamics – the inhibitory effect on cell migration by the stably - associated phosphorylation - incompetent cortactin could be reversed by truncating the N - terminal F - actin binding domains ( Figure 8B ) . The reduced interaction between the cortactin phos - phorylation mimic and FAK suggests that cortactin Wang et al . BMC Cell Biology 2011 , 12 : 49 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2121 / 12 / 49 Page 12 of 15 dissociates from focal adhesions after being phosphory - lated ( Figure 4D ) . Our results and those of others indi - cate that the cortactin phosphorylation mimic promotes focal adhesion turnover and increases cell migration ( Figure 8 ) [ 34 ] . It is very likely that cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation by the FAK - Src complex dissociates cortactin from focal adhesions and promotes F - actin turnover . The inhibition of cell migration by the N - terminal truncated cortactin phosphorylation mimic implies additional functions for tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin ( Figure 8 ) . Without the N - terminal F - actin binding domains , the phosphorylation mimic C - terminal can no longer interact with the F - actin cytoskeleton . This suggests that the C - terminus of the cortactin phos - phorylation mimic interferes with the ability of cortactin to regulate motility . Importantly , the C - terminus of the phosphorylation - incompetent cortactin mutant does not have a similar inhibitory effect on cell migration ( Figure 8 ) . Thus , the effect of the cortactin phosphorylation mimic C - terminus on cell migration is phosphorylation specific . The wild - type cortactin C - terminus can also inhibit cell migration because it can be phosphorylated within the cell ( Figure 6B and 8 ) . It is not clear what functions are perturbed by the cortactin phosphorylation mimic C - terminus . FAK autophosphorylation and cen - trosome orientation , which are important for cell moti - lity control , are not affected by the cortactin C - terminal mutants ( Figure 8C and 8D ) . Further study is required to clarify the role of the cortactin phosphorylation mimic C - terminus on cell migration . Conclusions In summary , we demonstrate that cortactin is recruited by FAK into focal adhesions , where it is phosphorylated by the FAK - Src complex . The interaction between FAK and cortactin is mediated by the SH3 domain and the proline - rich region and is regulated by FAK - Src com - plex - catalyzed cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . Cor - tactin at focal adhesions can further recruit cortactin interacting proteins . The structure of cortactin , which contains N - terminal F - actin binding domains and C - terminal FAK association domains , allows it to function as a bridge between the F - actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions . After the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortac - tin by the FAK - Src complex , the reduced interaction of cortactin with FAK leads to an increased turnover of the associated F - actin at focal adhesions . These changes in local F - actin dynamics ultimately regulate cell motility .
