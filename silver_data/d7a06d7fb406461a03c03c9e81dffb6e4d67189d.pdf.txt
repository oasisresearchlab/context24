Abstract : Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is characterized by increased permeability of the alveolar – capillary membrane , a thin barrier composed of adjacent monolayers of alveolar epithelial and lung microvascular endothelial cells . This results in pulmonary edema and severe hypoxemia and is a common cause of death after both viral ( e . g . , SARS - CoV - 2 ) and bacterial pneu - monia . The involvement of the lung in ARDS is notoriously heterogeneous , with consolidated and edematous lung abutting aerated , less injured regions . This makes treatment difﬁcult , as most therapeutic approaches preferentially affect the normal lung regions or are distributed indiscrimi - nately to other organs . In this review , we describe the use of thoracic ultrasound and microbubbles ( USMB ) to deliver therapeutic cargo ( drugs , genes ) preferentially to severely injured areas of the lung and in particular to the lung endothelium . While USMB has been explored in other organs , it has been under - appreciated in the treatment of lung injury since ultrasound energy is scattered by air . However , this limitation can be harnessed to direct therapy speciﬁcally to severely injured lungs . We explore the cellular mechanisms governing USMB and describe various permutations of cargo administration . Lastly , we discuss both the challenges and potential opportunities presented by USMB in the lung as a tool for both therapy and research . Keywords : acute respiratory distress syndrome ; ultrasound ; microbubbles ; endothelial cells ; vascular leak ; drug and gene delivery 1 . Introduction Endothelial cells line the entire vascular system and are the interface between blood and tissue [ 1 ] . A primary role of the microvascular endothelium is to regulate the ﬂux of molecules between the vascular lumen and the surrounding tissue parenchyma . A char - acteristic feature of the endothelium is heterogeneity between different - sized vessels ( e . g . , macrovascular , such as the aorta , vs . microvascular in capillaries ) and between different tissues . For instance in the lung , microvascular endothelial cell permeability is relatively low and tightly regulated by cell junctional complexes , of which major protein components include vascular endothelial ( VE ) - cadherin , claudin - 5 and occludins . By com - parison , the endothelial cells in the liver sinusoids have intercellular gaps that permit the free movement of ﬂuid and circulating components in and out of the vascular lumen . The role of endothelial dysfunction and increased permeability in the pathogenesis of inﬂammatory disease has been appreciated for decades [ 2 ] , but interest in its potential Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / biomedicines9070803 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / biomedicines Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 2 of 23 modulation as a therapy has grown with the COVID - 19 pandemic ; there has also been a broader realization of the importance of endothelial leakage in sepsis and lung injury [ 3 , 4 ] . Therapies that decrease endothelial permeability would be of particular interest in the lung , where acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS , also called acute lung injury ) is characterized by disrupted alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers , leading to pul - monary edema and arterial hypoxemia [ 5 ] . It occurs in nearly 10 % of all intensive care unit ( ICU ) admissions and results in a mortality rate of up to 40 % despite the best sup - portive care [ 6 ] . ARDS is usually caused by an excessive host inﬂammatory response to an infectious ( e . g . , pneumonia , sepsis ) or non - infectious insult ( e . g . , trauma ) , resulting in endothelial and / or epithelial damage and ﬂuid extravasation [ 7 ] . Treatment of ARDS is difﬁcult due to an incomplete understanding of its pathophysi - ology but also because of an inability to target severely injured regions of the lung . In this article , we ﬁrst brieﬂy review some fundamental determinants of endothelial activation and permeability ; subsequently , we focus our discussion on how the combination of thoracic ultrasound and intravenously administered microbubbles ( USMB ) may permit preferential delivery of therapeutic cargoes to the lung endothelium in the most damaged regions of the lung [ 3 , 8 ] . 1 . 1 . Endothelial Activation and Leakage during Inﬂammation 1 . 1 . 1 . Pulmonary Endothelial Inﬂammation and Vascular Permeability Endothelial cells undergo phenotypic changes after the binding of pro - inﬂammatory cytokines such as interleukin - 1 β ( IL - 1 β ) and tumor necrosis factor - α ( TNF - α ) to their receptors [ 9 ] . The most notable changes are an upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecules ( ICAM ) , vascular cell adhesion molecules ( VCAM ) , and endothelial cell - leukocyte adhesion molecules ( ELAM ) , which facilitate the binding of leukocytes [ 10 , 11 ] . ICAM - 1 has been well documented to be increased in the serum and lung tissue of ARDS patients [ 12 , 13 ] . Its knockout also showed an attenuation of edema in a septic mouse model attributed to impaired leukocyte recruitment to the site of injury [ 14 ] . The levels of E - selectin , the endothelial selectin , are also elevated in ARDS patients [ 15 ] . Despite their involvement in the disease , however , therapies targeting the selectins have yielded mixed results . Baboons with sepsis - induced ARDS did not respond to anti - E - selectin and L - selectin antibody therapy , despite an antibody targeting both selectins being protective in pigs [ 16 , 17 ] . Endothelial cells also contribute to inﬂammation by secreting pro - inﬂammatory cy - tokines themselves , directing immune cells to the site of injury and leading to an increase in vascular leakage [ 18 , 19 ] . Increased cytokines have been found in the alveolar lavage ﬂuid of ARDS patients [ 20 , 21 ] and , while necessary for the immune response , may contribute to tissue injury . Cytokines such as IL - 6 can induce endothelial permeability [ 22 ] ; others , such as IL - 1 β and TNF - α , are potent chemoattractants for leukocytes . The sensing of endoge - nous or exogenous inﬂammatory signals ( e . g . , bacterial lipopolysaccharide , viral nucleic acid ) triggers the formation and activation of the inﬂammasome in both immune cells and lung parenchymal tissue . The inﬂammasome is a multiprotein signaling complex that cat - alyzes cleavage and release of IL - 1 β and IL - 18 and has been shown to contribute to ARDS ( as reviewed in [ 23 ] ) ; inﬂammasomes consist of sensor , adaptor and effector components such as the NOD - like receptor , pyrin domain containing 3 ( NLRP3 ) protein which detects intracellular stress ( as reviewed in [ 24 ] ) . Activation of the NLRP3 - inﬂammasome has been postulated to contribute to lung injury in COVID - 19 , and blockade of pro - inﬂammatory cytokines with antibodies is a promising therapeutic strategy [ 25 – 29 ] . Excessive inﬂammation , as seen in ARDS , causes barrier disruption and ﬂuid leakage into the interstitial space . This is mediated through various mechanisms including the previously mentioned cytokines , an increase in reactive oxygen species production by activated leukocytes and the production of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs ) ( e . g . , in patients suffering from critical illness due to COVID - 19 ) [ 30 – 32 ] . Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 3 of 23 Much of the barrier integrity in the continuous microvascular endothelium is con - ferred by the adherens junctions , in which homophilic interactions between VE - cadherin hold adjacent cells together tightly [ 33 , 34 ] ( Figure 1 ) . A decrease in cell - surface VE - cadherin is an important step for the extravasation of leukocytes through selective tyrosine phos - phorylation and internalization [ 11 , 35 , 36 ] . In the context of lung injury , a decrease in VE - cadherin is mediated by multiple signals , including TNF - α , thrombin , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) [ 34 ] . Other non - inﬂammatory signaling molecules can decrease permeability . Angiopoietin - 2 is a well - characterized negative regulatory ligand for receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 , inhibiting its phosphorylation and increasing endothelial permeability [ 37 ] . Levels of angiopoietin - 2 act as a marker of clinical outcome and injury severity in trauma and sepsis patients [ 38 , 39 ] . The angiogenic cytokine VEGF is also higher in critically ill patients ; paradoxically , while higher VEGF levels are associated with a poor prognosis , it is not predictive of lung edema [ 39 , 40 ] . Figure 1 . Anatomy of the alveolus . The alveolus is the basic functional unit of the lung . An extremely thin alveolar wall allows for gas exchange between air and blood . The outer layer is composed of pulmonary epithelial cells ( also known as pneumocytes ) , of which there are two types . Type I epithelial cells permit gas exchange , while type II epithelial cells produce pulmonary surfactant . Pulmonary endothelial cells form the inner layer of the wall and line the pulmonary microvasculature . Endothelial cells form a continuous layer formed through tight and adherens cellular junctions between neighboring cells , thus preventing ﬂuid leakage out of the lung . Vascular endothelial cadherin ( VE - cadherin ) , claudins , and occludins form these junctions through homophilic and / or heterophilic interactions , restricting junction width to 2 – 5 nm . Created with BioRender . com . More recently , additional players have been identiﬁed as being involved in the dis - rupted lung endothelium in ARDS [ 41 ] . The forkhead box protein M1 , an important transcription factor involved in cell proliferation , is key in repairing the pulmonary en - dothelium in multiple models of murine lung injury [ 42 , 43 ] . Various microRNAs ( miRs ) are also of interest due to their crucial roles in the regulation of the expression of multiple genes : miR - 150 levels are inversely correlated with the severity of disease in ARDS patients , and it has been demonstrated to decrease the severity of lung injury by repairing cellular junctions [ 44 , 45 ] . miR - 26a - 5p , through the reduction in connective tissue growth factor , pro - tected mice with lung injury from lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , i . e . , endotoxin ) by decreasing the severity of inﬂammation [ 46 ] . Finally , ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 and phospholipase D2 have been reported to stabilize VE - cadherin—the former by inhibiting pro - inﬂammatory Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 4 of 23 pathways , and the latter by preventing VE - cadherin phosphorylation—thereby improving pulmonary endothelial barrier permeability [ 47 , 48 ] . Despite this accruing knowledge as to the regulation of lung microvascular endothelial permeability , there has been relatively little progress in its therapeutic manipulation . 1 . 1 . 2 . Pulmonary Endothelial Dysfunction—Coagulation While endothelial cells normally inhibit coagulation , when activated they initiate the coagulation cascade by the expression of tissue factor . Ultimately , the cascade produces thrombin and ﬁbrin . Tissue factor - induced coagulation is a signiﬁcant contributor to mortality in critical illness and play a large role in ARDS [ 49 , 50 ] . In addition to being a direct pro - coagulant , thrombin interferes with the endothelial barrier and exacerbates vascular leakage through binding to its receptor proteinase - activated receptor 1 ( PAR1 ) [ 51 ] . Activated endothelial cells also exhibit an inhibition of their normally pro - ﬁbrinolytic state due to an upregulation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( PAI - 1 ) [ 52 ] . Indeed , endothelial cells collected from the lungs of ARDS patients demonstrate an increase in both thrombin and PAI - 1 [ 53 ] . Of note , microvascular thrombosis has been recognized as playing a role in the pathology of patients with severe COVID - 19 [ 54 ] . A study comparing ARDS lung autopsies between COVID - 19 patients and inﬂuenza patients found a nine - fold higher incidence of microvascular thrombosis in the lungs of COVID - 19 patients [ 55 ] . 1 . 2 . Current Therapies Targeting the Endothelium Given the central role of the lung microvascular endothelium in the pathogenesis of ARDS and sepsis , numerous approaches to modulate endothelial cell activation and decrease vascular leakage are being investigated [ 56 ] . For example , the sphingolipid sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( S1P ) is a potent enhancer of the endothelial barrier while also acting to regulate systemic cytokine levels [ 22 , 57 ] . Very recently , Akhter et al . used an endothelial - speciﬁc S1P receptor - 1 ( S1PR1 ) knockout animal model to investigate the role of S1P in pulmonary endothelial regeneration in an endotoxemia injury model [ 58 ] . They found that S1P1R deletion resulted in increased endothelial permeability . Furthermore , they determined that S1PR1 - expressing endothelial cells are required for barrier repair , and that these cells were reprogrammed to increase the production of S1P , suggesting therapeutic potential for the S1P pathway in endothelial injury . There has also been extensive interest in targeting the angiopoietin receptor Tie2 and its signaling axis as a means to restore the endothelial barrier . For example , the Tie2 agonist vasculotide was shown to decrease vascular leakage , tissue edema and organ dysfunction in multiple animal models of sepsis or lung injury [ 59 – 61 ] . The simultaneous sequestration of the inhibitory ligand angiopoietin - 2 and the activation of Tie2 was shown to restore endothelial barrier integrity and reduce mortality in septic animals [ 62 ] . Targeting the Tie2 pathway combined with decreasing circulating VEGF rescued septic mice by reducing ICAM - 1 levels , decreasing inﬂammation , and improving endothelial barrier strength [ 63 ] . Increasing the activity of Tie2 by means of the inhibition of VE - protein tyrosine phosphatase , a Tie2 - inactivating protein , also enhanced the endothelial barrier in the lungs and retinas of mice [ 64 , 65 ] . More generally , it is important to point out that a number of groups have now inde - pendently shown that decreasing vascular leakage can be accomplished without impairing innate immunity , highlighting the fact that tissue edema and leukocyte recruitment can be controlled separately [ 2 ] . Despite these conceptual and therapeutic advances , targeting the endothelium for therapy remains challenging , especially in the injured lung . Nanoparticle - enhanced de - livery systems are the subject of intense research [ 66 ] . Inhalation of nanoparticles did show transit into the vascular space , suggesting that the endothelial barrier is reached [ 67 ] . The speciﬁc composition of nanoparticles can regulate their delivery , as demonstrated by one group showing the speciﬁcity of their nanoparticles for the alveolar endothelium , with or without cargo [ 68 – 70 ] . To increase endothelial speciﬁcity even further , antibodies Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 5 of 23 and ligands for endothelial - speciﬁc receptors have been added to the nanoparticles . For example , peptides against sialic acid , ephrin type - A receptor 2 , and ICAM have all been described [ 71 – 74 ] . Nonetheless , a major issue is how to preferentially deliver therapeutic cargo to the most injured regions of the lung in ARDS . This is particularly problematic given the heterogeneity of the lung in ARDS , in which severely consolidated areas in the lungs of a given patient may be abutting relatively aerated regions [ 75 , 76 ] . Intravenous administration of drugs ( including nanoparticles ) may result in undesirable off - target effects in other organs such as the kidney or liver . Hypoxic vasoconstriction ( the normal narrowing of vessels in the lung in response to hypoxia ) may complicate this further by decreasing the amount of drug able to reach the tissue . Inhaled agents are preferentially distributed to the best ventilated areas of the lung , potentially neglecting the most injured regions ; furthermore , they make ﬁrst contact with the lung epithelium , potentially decreasing access to the lung endothelium . Thus , there is a need for a delivery method which can achieve a high rate of lung endothelial delivery and preferentially targets the most injured lung areas . 2 . Introduction to Ultrasound - Microbubble Mediated Therapy Over the past two decades , ultrasound - microbubble ( USMB ) - mediated intracellular drug and gene delivery has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of the endothelium . One of the ﬁrst reports on USMB - mediated intracellular delivery appeared in the late 1990s when ultrasound and commercial ultrasound imaging contrast microbubbles ( Albunex ® ) were used for the transfection of cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells with a pGL2 luciferase reporter plasmid [ 77 ] . Since then , USMB - mediated delivery has been used for a variety of in vitro and in vivo applications such as delivering drugs across the blood – brain barrier , transfecting liver cancer cells with genes for therapy as well as delivering drugs to endothelial cells [ 78 – 81 ] . The principle of the method is as follows : When circulating microbubbles are exposed to ultrasound , they grow and shrink in response to the alternating low - and high - pressure portions of the acoustic wave ( i . e . , cavita - tion ) . These oscillations of microbubbles exert mechanical forces on the endothelium , which increases local vascular permeability and facilitates delivery of external molecules into tar - geted tissues [ 82 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Depending on the intrinsic properties of the microbubbles and applied ultrasound parameters , microbubbles may undergo stable oscillations ( i . e . , stable cavitation ) or violent oscillations and collapse ( i . e . , inertial cavitation ) [ 83 ] . Microbubble oscillations induce acoustic microstreaming ﬂows in the surrounding medium while violent collapse leads to the formation of high - velocity microjets and shockwaves which induce shear stresses on the endothelium , leading to intracellular and trans - endothelial delivery of drugs or plasmids [ 84 , 85 ] . Since microbubbles undergo cavitation only in the presence of an ultrasound ﬁeld , the delivery is highly targeted towards the speciﬁc area of insonation , thus reducing off - target effects . Microbubbles used for this application often contain a high molecular weight perﬂuo - rocarbon gas core surrounded by a protective shell made from lipids , proteins or polymers which improve their stability and lifetime [ 86 ] . The microbubbles can be co - administered intravenously along with drugs or other cargo , or can be designed to carry the therapeutic cargo inside the bubble or bound to the microbubble surface [ 87 ] . Due to its ease of application , non - invasive and highly localized nature , USMB - mediated drug / gene delivery is an attractive option for the treatment of the endothelium . The endothelium is known to play a crucial role in several vascular pathologies including arterial restenosis , arteriosclerosis , thrombosis , and hypertension [ 88 ] . To date , several research groups have demonstrated the utility of USMB - mediated delivery for endothelial treatment . For example , USMB has been utilized for successful intra - endothelial delivery of plasmid DNA encoding a phosphomimetic variant of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS S1177D ) gene , enhancing the production of nitric oxide ( NO ) , which is a crucial me - diator of anti - atherosclerotic effects [ 89 ] . Another study utilized USMB - mediated delivery Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 6 of 23 of rapamycin ( an antiproliferative drug ) for successful inhibition of neointima formation , a condition resulting from endothelial denudation , in rat carotid arteries [ 90 ] . Figure 2 . Basic principle of ultrasound - microbubble ( USMB ) - mediated drug and gene delivery . When microbubbles ﬂowing through the blood are exposed to the ultrasound ﬁeld , they undergo rapid changes in size and shape ( i . e . , cavitation ) , inducing high shear stresses on the surrounding endothelium . This increases vascular permeability and cellular internalization ( e . g . , endocytosis ) , leading to targeted delivery of drugs / genes in the area of insonation . The result is enhanced delivery of therapeutic cargo to the local endothelium itself and to the organ being perfused . Created with BioRender . com . The cellular mechanisms of how USMB enhances drug delivery include sonoporation and endocytosis ; these will be brieﬂy reviewed here . 2 . 1 . Mechanisms of USMB - Mediated Intracellular Delivery 2 . 1 . 1 . Sonoporation The term ‘sonoporation’ refers to the formation of transient pores in the cell membrane upon exposure to ultrasound - activated microbubbles . The formation of pores enhances membrane permeability , thus facilitating intracellular delivery of external molecules . Sev - eral investigations have been carried out to characterize these membrane pores . Using indirect molecular probing and direct visualization using scanning - electron microscopy ( SEM ) , one study revealed the formation of membrane pores in the size range of 75 – 100 nm following USMB treatment of MAT B III cells [ 91 ] . Another study utilized transmembrane current measurements of Xenopus laevis oocytes for real - time monitoring of sonopora - tion , following treatment with ultrasound and commercial Deﬁnity ® microbubbles . The results indicate the formation of membrane pores of radius 110 ± 40 nm [ 92 ] . Several other investigations have been performed to characterize the membrane pore size follow - ing USMB treatment using advanced atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy techniques [ 93 – 97 ] . The membrane pores formed by sonoporation are transient and reseal within a few sec - onds or minutes . Few researchers have investigated the temporal dynamics of membrane resealing following sonoporation by cavitating microbubbles . Using live - cell ﬂuorescence microscopy and the ﬂuorescent dyes Fura - 2 and propidium iodide , one study observed membrane resealing in endothelial cells within 5 s of exposure to single - shot pulsed ul - trasound with microbubbles [ 98 ] . Another recent investigation utilized real - time confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy to visualize membrane resealing and observed that the resealing process could be completed with 1 min , depending on the initial pore size [ 99 ] . All these studies have provided strong visual evidence of membrane perforation and resealing Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 7 of 23 following USMB treatment , suggesting sonoporation as a major mechanism of USMB - mediated cargo delivery . Why USMB induces sonoporation has been explained by physical phenomena such as acoustic microstreaming , shock waves and microjets generated by the cavitating microbub - bles in the surrounding medium ; these will be brieﬂy discussed in the next section . Acoustic Microstreaming Ultrasound - driven , oscillating microbubbles undergoing stable cavitation are known to generate steady vortical ﬂows in the surrounding liquid ( i . e . , swirling motion of sur - rounding liquid ) , frequently referred as acoustic microstreaming [ 100 ] . It is suggested that these microstreaming ﬂows induce a shear stress on the nearby cells resulting in tension and stretching of the membrane , thereby inducing transient membrane perforation [ 101 , 102 ] . One of the earliest experimental studies on microstreaming - induced sonoporation was performed with an ultrasonic horn transducer ( also known as Mason horn , sonotrode , ultrasonic homogenizer or disintegrator ) vibrating at 21 . 4 kHz inside a Jurkat lymphocyte suspension [ 103 , 104 ] . These experiments suggested that microstreaming ﬂows generated by the vibrating Mason horn induce a shear stress of 12 Pa , which is sufﬁcient to induce sonoporation in Jurkat lymphocytes upon exposure for 7 min . Theoretical calculations performed by the same research group indicated that acoustic microstreaming ﬂows gen - erated by microbubbles could induce shear stresses of similar or higher magnitude , thus facilitating sonoporation [ 101 ] . Using a combination of particle image velocimetry ( PIV ) and theoretical analysis , other researchers have shown that the shear stresses induced by acoustic microstreaming ﬂows around microbubbles are signiﬁcantly higher ( ~ 19 Pa ) than the shear stresses induced by normal blood ﬂow ( ~ 0 . 5 – 2 Pa ) , resulting in sonopo - ration [ 102 ] . These and several other theoretical and experimental studies showed that acoustic microstreaming may be a major mechanism of sonoporation [ 105 – 107 ] . Fur - thermore , microstreaming ﬂow pattern is strongly dependent on the driving ultrasound frequency , microbubble size , pressure amplitude , properties of surrounding media as well as oscillation mode of microbubbles , which might explain why sonoporation and intracellular delivery of molecules are strongly affected by these parameters , as noted in several other studies [ 102 , 108 – 110 ] . Shock Waves and Liquid Microjets Besides acoustic microstreaming , shockwaves and liquid microjets erupting from a col - lapsing microbubble undergoing inertial cavitation are suggested as possible mechanisms of sonoporation . Cavitating microbubbles undergoing symmetrical bubble collapse gener - ate a strong shock wave in the surrounding medium which may exert a signiﬁcant shear stress to perforate the membrane . Some experimental studies show that the amplitude of a shock wave generated by a single collapsing bubble can be as high as 1 GPa ; however , this shock dies down rapidly and can only make an impact at distances comparable to the initial microbubble radius [ 100 ] . However , in the presence of multiple microbubbles , shockwaves emitted by several collapsing bubbles may combine and make an impact over larger distances [ 100 ] . Some molecular dynamics simulation studies have shown that a lipid bilayer membrane exposed to shockwaves may undergo compression and rebound , resulting in the formation of membrane pores during the reorganization of the lipid bilayer [ 111 – 113 ] . Though this study did not consider shockwaves erupting from collapsing bubbles , the mechanism may be similar for sonoporation induced by collapsing bubble shockwaves . Fundamental ﬂuid mechanics studies have revealed that a cavitating microbubble near a wall or a solid boundary collapses asymmetrically , ejecting fast liquid microjets towards the wall [ 114 , 115 ] . It has been hypothesized that when a microbubble undergoes inertial cavitation near the walls of blood vessels , the microjets ejected from asymmetrical collapse exert high shear stresses on the endothelial cells , causing membrane poration [ 116 ] . Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 8 of 23 Some experimental studies conducted in the late 2000s have supported this hypothe - sis [ 94 , 98 , 117 ] . 2 . 1 . 2 . Endocytosis For several years , sonoporation was thought to be the major mechanism of USMB - mediated intracellular delivery . However , mounting evidence now suggests that endocy - tosis may also play a major role . Experiments with primary endothelial cells exposed to USMB in the presence of ﬂuorescent dextrans ( 4 . 4 to 500 kDa ) have shown localization of 155 and 500 kDa dextrans in distinct vesicles and uniform distribution of 4 . 4 and 70 kDa dextrans throughout the cytosol [ 118 ] . Furthermore , this study showed a signiﬁcant de - crease in the intracellular delivery of all dextran molecules after independent inhibition of caveolin - mediated endocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis pathways . Additionally , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) depletion showed a reduced uptake of 4 . 4 kDa dextran with no uptake of 500 kDa after USMB treatment , consistent with the inhibition of endocytosis ( which requires ATP ) rather than an effect on sonoporation . Using 3D ﬂuorescence microscopy , this study also demonstrated colocalization of 500 kDa dextran vesicles with caveolin - 1 and clathrin [ 118 ] . Together , this evidence suggests that endocytosis is a major mechanism of USMB - mediated intracellular delivery , especially for larger molecules . In another study , C6 rat glioma cells were treated with either chlorpromazine ( a non - speciﬁc inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) or genistein ( used to inhibit caveolae - mediated endocytosis ) before exposure to USMB in the presence of the ﬂuorescent dye SYTOX green [ 119 ] . The results showed a 2 . 5 - fold increase in the SYTOX uptake time constant for the chlorpromazine - treated group , and a 1 . 1 - fold increase in the uptake time constant for the genistein - treated group , indicating the dominance of the clathrin - mediated pathway in USMB - mediated endocytosis . Unfortunately , the lack of speciﬁcity of the inhibitors limits the interpretation of this study [ 119 ] . Similar results were obtained in another investigation which showed increased clathrin content per clathrin - coated pit and enhanced clathrin - mediated endocytosis within 5 min of USMB exposure [ 120 ] . Some researchers have also studied the inﬂuence of ultrasound parameters on the uptake mechanisms ( i . e . , sonoporation vs . endocytosis ) . When human melanoma cells were subjected to USMB in the presence of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - dextran at different acoustic pressures ( 100 – 500 kPa ) , endocytosis , as evidenced by the presence of dextrans in vesicles , appeared to be a dominant mechanism of cellular uptake at low acoustic pressures . In contrast , sonoporation appeared to be more dominant at higher acoustic pressures [ 121 ] . The dependency of uptake mechanisms on applied acoustic pressures may be linked to the acoustic behavior of microbubbles , which change at different acoustic pressures . Biological Mechanisms of USMB - Induced Endocytosis Several biological mechanisms of USMB - induced endocytosis have been suggested in the literature [ 122 ] . Some studies have shown that when cells are exposed to USMB or just ultrasound , a strong inﬂux of Ca 2 + ions is induced [ 118 , 123 , 124 ] . It is believed that the high intracellular Ca 2 + concentration stimulates endocytosis ; however , the ex - act mechanism is unclear [ 122 ] . It has also been suggested that the increase in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production upon exposure to ultrasound stimulates endocytosis by a ROS - dependent mechanism such as caveolae internalization due to ROS - induced caveolin - 1 phosphorylation or by increasing the calcium inﬂux [ 122 , 123 , 125 ] . However , the detailed mechanism of ROS - activated endocytosis remains elusive . According to an - other hypothesis , the exocytosis of lysosomes plays a crucial role in the regulation of clathrin - dependent endocytosis induced by USMB treatment [ 122 ] . The evidence for this comes from the observation that the lysosomal marker protein ( Lamp - 1 ) accumulates in the plasma membrane at the same time as USMB - induced endocytosis occurs , while the inhibition of lysosome exocytosis signiﬁcantly reduces the activity of the transferrin receptor , which plays a crucial role in clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 120 , 122 ] . At present , Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 9 of 23 however , the precise biological mechanisms of USMB - induced endocytosis are not fully understood and more study is necessary . Physical Mechanisms of USMB - Induced Endocytosis Endocytosis is thought to be initiated by direct physical interactions between mi - crobubbles and the cells or through certain biological pathways triggered by these physical interactions [ 122 ] . Though the exact physical mechanisms responsible for triggering en - docytosis remain elusive , certain hypotheses have been proposed . As discussed earlier , oscillating or collapsing microbubbles produce microstreaming ﬂows , shockwaves or liq - uid microjets in the surrounding liquid . The shear stresses produced by these physical phenomena may induce membrane deformations and trigger endocytosis , as noted in some earlier investigations [ 126 , 127 ] . A second hypothesis states that the forces exerted on the plasma membrane due to microbubble – cell interactions can be transmitted downstream to the cytoskeleton , leading to cytoskeleton remodeling [ 122 ] . This process may in turn activate mechano - sensors such as integrins or stretch - activated ion channels , triggering certain endocytotic pathways [ 122 ] . Another hypothesis suggests that endocytosis is not an independent phenomenon but is triggered by sonoporation caused by exposure to USMB [ 122 ] . According to this hypothesis , formation of lysosomal patches and exocytosis is essential for sealing large membrane pores caused by USMB treatment . The lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase released during the exocytosis process converts sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane to ceramide , leading to inward budding and formation of vesicles , which is considered to be a prelude to the endocytosis process [ 122 ] . Though multiple hy - potheses exist , there is no consensus on the physical mechanisms triggering USMB - induced endocytosis and more investigations need to be performed in this area . In summary , sonoporation and endocytosis both lead to intracellular delivery of molecules ; however , it is difﬁcult to say which one of the two dominates . The size of the molecules and the acoustic parameters are likely critical determinants [ 118 ] . Endocytosis may also be an unavoidable consequence of sonoporation and may be required for resealing of membrane pores [ 122 ] . Relative to sonoporation , endocytosis is an active and regulated pathway for the delivery of molecules and is therefore considered by some to be potentially safer for cargo delivery [ 122 ] . 2 . 1 . 3 . Cargo Delivery Using USMB—On , Inside , or Around ? Different approaches for delivering cargo using microbubbles have been described . Here , we will discuss the three most common approaches used for various USMB applica - tions , namely—binding the cargo to the microbubble shell using electrostatic or covalent interactions , embedding cargo inside the microbubble shell and co - administration of cargo and microbubbles . Though the approaches discussed here are not speciﬁc to the treat - ment of endothelium , the same strategies could be useful for treating lung endothelial dysfunction using USMB . Electrostatic or Covalent Binding of Cargo to the Microbubble Shell Several attempts have been made to bind cargo ( i . e . , drugs or plasmids ) to the mi - crobubble shell using electrostatic or covalent interactions [ 128 ] . Due to the proximity of the cargo to the microbubble shell , it is speculated that this approach leads to enhanced deliv - ery efﬁcacy due to cavitation effects [ 129 ] . In addition , the release of cargo could be limited to the area of insonation , thus reducing any adverse side - effects related to free circulating drug [ 129 ] . Plasmids , which have an inherent negative charge , can be bound onto the shells of cationic lipid microbubbles using electrostatic interactions . This approach ensures that the plasmid DNA is protected from degradation by endonucleases , thereby increasing local DNA concentration for USMB - mediated transfection [ 130 ] . Cationic microbubbles bound with plasmid DNA have been used to transfect click beetle luciferase ( CBLuc ) plasmids into endothelial cells using USMB treatment in vitro [ 130 ] . In another investigation , researchers used cationic microbubbles loaded with short hairpin RNA interference therapy targeting Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 10 of 23 prolyl hydroxylase - 2 ( shPHD2 ) plasmid for USMB - assisted myocardial transfection to protect the heart from myocardial infarction [ 131 ] . Cationic microbubbles are usually made by incorporating cationic lipids such as 1 , 2 - dioctadecanoyl - 3 - trimethylammonium - propane ( DSTAP ) into the shells of lipid microbubbles or by coating the shell with cationic polymers such as poly - ( allylamine hydrochloride ) when using albumin microbubbles [ 130 , 132 ] . The plasmid loading capacity is limited by the surface area of microbubbles . The maximum plasmid loading capacity usually ranges from 0 . 001 to 0 . 005 pg / µ m 2 [ 133 ] . In order to increase the plasmid loading capacity , a layer - by - layer construction of microbubbles with alternate plasmid ( anionic ) and poly - L - lysine ( cationic ) layers has been proposed [ 133 ] . Using this technique , the plasmid loading capacity has been reported to increase over 10 - fold using ﬁve paired layers [ 133 ] . Apart from plasmids , various other cargos such as drug - loaded liposomes or nanopar - ticles have been bound to the surface of microbubbles . For example , doxorubicin ( DOX ) - loaded liposomes were covalently attached to lipid - shelled microbubbles via thiol - maleimide linkages and then used for USMB - mediated delivery to human glioblastoma cells [ 134 ] . The results indicated a four - fold decrease in cell viability with DOX - liposome loaded microbubbles compared to free DOX - liposomes or DOX alone [ 134 ] . Embedding Cargo Inside the Microbubble Shell Similar to electrostatic or covalent binding , embedding the cargo inside the microbub - ble shell could have a protective effect on the cargo , preventing its early degradation and prolonging its half - life inside the body [ 129 ] . Different types of cargo have been embedded inside the microbubble shell . In one study , rapamycin , an anti - proliferative drug , was embedded inside lipidshells of microbubbles for USMB - mediated attenuation of smooth muscle cell proliferation [ 90 ] . In vitro assays indicated that the delivery ef - ﬁcacy of rapamycin - loaded microbubbles was signiﬁcantly higher than microbubbles co - administered with free rapamycin [ 90 ] . In another investigation , plasmid DNA encod - ing for the LacZ gene was incorporated into albumin microbubble shell and then used for USMB - mediated vascular gene transfection [ 89 ] . It has been demonstrated that the in vitro efﬁciency of transfection using plasmid - DNA embedded microbubbles is signiﬁ - cantly higher than the transfection efﬁciency of the co - administration of microbubbles and plasmid [ 135 ] . Though both the approaches ( namely binding the cargo to the microbubble shell ( Section 2 . 1 . 3 ) and embedding the cargo inside the microbubble shell ) prevent early degra - dation of cargo inside the body , there is no study which directly compares the cargo delivery efﬁcacy of these two approaches . Therefore , it is difﬁcult to say which of these two approaches is better . Co - Administration of Cargo and Microbubbles Co - administration of cargo with microbubbles is one of the simplest approaches for cargo delivery using USMB . In the method , a mixture of free drugs / plasmids and microbubbles is injected into the circulation or directly at the site of insonation . For example , in a recent investigation , a mixture of lipid - coated microbubbles and propidium iodide ( PI ) was utilized for USMB - mediated delivery of PI into endothelial cells cultured in microﬂuidic channels [ 136 ] . In another study , mixtures of microbubbles and evans blue dye / ﬂuorescent - dextran were used to study USMB - mediated drug delivery to the brain in mice [ 137 ] . A mixture of commercial SonoVue microbubbles and enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein plasmid ( pEGFP ) were used to study USMB - assisted gene transfection in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in a recent investigation [ 138 ] . 2 . 1 . 4 . Modiﬁcation of the Microbubble to Enhance Delivery Further methods have been developed to speciﬁcally target the area of endothelial inﬂammation or endothelial dysfunction . By covalently attaching receptors for markers expressed by endothelial cells during inﬂammation to the microbubbles , the bubbles Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 11 of 23 attach and remain adjacent to the cells that require therapeutic cargo delivery . Activated endothelial cells have increased expression of ICAM - 1 , allowing it to be used as a binding target for microbubbles [ 139 ] . Conjugation of an ICAM - 1 antibody to the microbubble surface resulted in signiﬁcant binding to activated endothelial cells in culture under shear ﬂow compared to no binding to healthy endothelial cells [ 139 ] . Conjugating VCAM - 1 and E - selectin antibodies to microbubbles through a biotin - streptavidin reaction has also been evaluated for binding to activated endothelial cells [ 140 ] . Microbubbles conjugated to any of the three antibodies had signiﬁcantly increased binding to human endothelial cells activated with 6 h or TNF - α treatment compared to untreated cells [ 140 ] . Microscopic imaging observed improved binding of antibody - conjugated microbubbles to activated human and mouse endothelial cells following exposure to the bubbles under ﬂow conditions compared to non - conjugated microbubbles [ 140 ] . A potential method to improve the targeting of activated endothelial cells would be dual targeting with several of the previously mentioned antibodies . While Barriero et al . demonstrated dual targeting with endothelial markers ( CD9 and ICAM - 1 ) , it has not yet been tested with both markers only present on activated endothelial cells and not healthy cells [ 141 ] . Targeted microbubbles have been especially useful in delivering therapeutic cargo to injured heart tissue . Using cationic microbubbles conjugated to P - selectin antibodies for targeting ischemic areas in a murine ischemia model and bound to a plasmid coding for hVEGF165 , Shentu et al . delivered genetic cargo to the cardiac endothelium [ 142 ] . The study observed enhanced deposition of the genetic cargo resulting in improvement to cardiac function compared to without the targeting ligand [ 142 ] . A similar study successfully delivered the angiopoietin - 1 gene using cationic microbubbles targeted with an ICAM - 1 antibody to improve endothelial function and stimulate angiogenesis in an ischemic murine model [ 143 ] . 2 . 2 . A New Frontier ? Ultrasound and Microbubble Treatment of the Injured Lung Despite the abundant literature describing ultrasound and microbubbles for cargo delivery across the blood – brain barrier or to tumors , there are very few reports of the technique in the lung . Early use of ultrasound in the lung focused on the study of pleural disease rather than lung tissue itself [ 144 ] , since ultrasound is scattered by the air in healthy air - ﬁlled lung tissue . This has likely also delayed recognition of the potential of USMB to enhance drug delivery to the injured lung . In fact , lung injury or ARDS may be ideally suited to USMB - mediated therapy , since ﬂuid leaking into the alveoli and the loss of air allows ultrasound waves to selectively penetrate the most injured lung regions [ 144 ] . Normal ( aerated ) or less - diseased regions of the lung would scatter the ultrasound energy , preventing or reducing off - target effects [ 145 ] . USMB is also likely to be effective for targeting densely consolidated lung ( as in lobar pneumonia ) , even in the absence of diffuse disease ( Figure 3 ) . The amount of penetration of ultrasound in the most injured , ﬂuid - ﬁlled regions of the lung and normal , air - ﬁlled regions of the lung can be quantitatively estimated using acoustic impedance values of lung tissue , air and blood ( Table 1 ) [ 146 ] . Table 1 . Acoustic impedance values of lung , air , and blood . Medium Acoustic Impedance Lung 0 . 18 × 10 6 Rayls Air 0 . 0004 × 10 6 Rayls Blood 1 . 65 × 10 6 Rayls Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 12 of 23 Figure 3 . Courtesy of Laurent J . Brochard , St . Michael’s Hospital , Toronto ( A ) Lung CT scan ( cross - sectional view ) from a patient with ARDS showing heterogenous distribution of injured , ﬂuid - ﬁlled regions of the lung ( B ) USMB treatment of the lung targets the most injured and edematous regions . ( a ) Ultrasound energy is unable to penetrate the relatively healthy aerated sections of the lung , reﬂecting instead . Microbubbles in this region ﬂow through the capillaries unaffected by the ultrasound waves . ( b ) Ultrasound energy is able to penetrate when the alveoli are ﬁlled with ﬂuid in edematous or de - aerated regions , sonicating the microbubbles . Cavitation of the microbubbles is induced , resulting in cellular uptake of therapeutic cargo preferentially in the most injured area of the lungs . Created with BioRender . com . The amount of reﬂection and transmission of incident ultrasound wave at the lung – air interface and lung – ﬂuid ( i . e . , blood ) interface can be calculated using ultrasound reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients . R = (cid:18) Z 2 − Z 1 Z 2 + Z 1 (cid:19) 2 ( 1 ) T = 4 Z 2 Z 1 ( Z 2 + Z 1 ) 2 ( 2 ) where R is the ultrasound reﬂection coefﬁcient and T is the ultrasound transmission coefﬁcient . Here , Z 1 and Z 2 are acoustic impedance values of medium 1 and medium 2 , respectively , at the interface that is exposed to the ultrasound wave . For the lung – air interface , Z 1 can be assumed as the acoustic impedance of the lung while Z 2 can be assumed as the acoustic impedance of the air . Similarly , for the lung – blood interface , Z 1 can be considered as the acoustic impedance of the lung and Z 2 can be considered as the acoustic impedance of the blood . Using the above equations , it can be observed that almost the entire incident ultra - sound wave ( 99 . 1 % ) is reﬂected back at the lung – air interface , while only 0 . 9 % penetrates in the air - ﬁlled regions of the lung . On the contrary , 35 . 5 % of the incident ultrasound penetrates the lung – blood interface , which is signiﬁcantly higher than the penetration at the lung – air interface . These numbers quantitatively show that ultrasound energy pene - trates the most injured areas of lungs , showing its potential for targeted drug and gene delivery . This remarkable selectivity of USMB for the most injured regions of the lung sets it apart from other potential endothelial - targeted therapeutic strategies such as nanoparticles or microparticles . The ﬁrst instance of USMB treatment for the delivery of therapeutic cargo to injured lung tissue was recently published by our group ( 2018 ) , demonstrating delivery of the Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 13 of 23 aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamycin in an E . coli - induced murine pneumonia model [ 147 ] . The study demonstrated an almost ten - fold reduction in bacterial colony - forming units following USMB treatment with gentamycin compared to gentamycin alone , an intrigu - ing ﬁnding given that aminoglycoside antibiotics do not normally distribute well to the lung [ 147 ] . In fact , the dose of gentamicin that was administered was too low to inhibit bacterial growth in the absence of concomitant microbubbles and thoracic ultrasound [ 147 ] . USMB treatment signiﬁcantly increased gentamicin concentrations in both bronchoalve - olar lavage ﬂuid and lung lysates [ 147 ] . In this study , USMB was also shown to have no detrimental effect on oxygenation or on the degree of lung injury scored in a blinded fashion by a lung pathologist [ 147 ] . These results of enhanced delivery to injured lung tissue were later validated in a rabbit model by a French group , who reported enhanced delivery of another aminoglycoside antibiotic , amikacin , to ﬂuid - ﬁlled lung tissue [ 148 ] . Flooding the rabbits’ lungs with saline allowed the group to apply USMB treatment while administering amikacin at two doses , comparing delivery to sonicated and non - sonicated lung tissue [ 148 ] . USMB treatment signiﬁcantly increased amikacin concentration in the sonicated lung tissue compared to the non - sonicated lung tissue , with a greater degree of enhancement observed at the lower amikacin dose [ 148 ] . Both of these studies highlight the enhancement of therapeutic cargo delivery by USMB at doses below the physiologically effective dosage . The therapeutic beneﬁts of delivering pulmonary surfactant ( sinapultide ) using USMB has also been investigated ; delivery of sinapultide by insonation of sinapultide - loaded microbubbles reduced the severity of injury and levels of the inﬂammatory cytokines IL - 6 and TNF - α in an LPS - induced model of lung injury [ 149 ] . Finally , USMB treatment has also been used to explore the therapeutic effects of delivering a VEGF antagonist ( soluble fms - like tyrosine kinase - 1 ) encapsulated in the microbubbles to a murine model of LPS - induced lung injury [ 150 ] . The lung injury group receiving USMB with soluble fms - like tyrosine kinase - 1 exhibited improved P a O 2 , reduced lung injury score and wet - to - dry ratio , and a lower 7 - day mortality rate compared to injured counterparts receiving USMB treatment with empty microbubbles [ 150 ] . This treatment was found to enhance endothelial barrier function by inhibiting the endothelial permeability caused by VEGF while avoiding off - target effects [ 150 ] . Despite these intriguing examples , however , the use of USMB in the injured lung still remains largely unexplored . Speciﬁcally , it remains to be seen whether other therapeutic cargoes such as plasmids and non - coding RNA can be harnessed with USMB to treat lung injury . 3 . Future Directions—Challenges and Opportunities 3 . 1 . Trade off of Increased Leakage vs . Cargo Delivery One concern with USMB in the lung is the risk of increasing endothelial leakage or inﬂammation through sonoporation . Although sonoporation is transient , in theory it could aggravate tissue damage in the injured lung ; on the other hand , sonoporation will also further enhance the delivery of therapeutic cargoes . Inﬂammation of the blood – brain barrier has been observed when treating with a microbubble dose 10 times higher than the clinical imaging dose ; no damage was observed with the clinical dose [ 151 ] . The high microbubble dose also corresponded to increased contrast agent uptake in the surrounding tissue , indicating that increased inﬂammation and leakage allows for more cargo deliv - ery [ 151 ] . Steroids such as dexamethasone have been investigated as a countermeasure to USMB - inﬂicted inﬂammation in the blood – brain barrier , with beneﬁcial results [ 152 ] . Real - time microscopy of USMB - induced cultured endothelial barrier disruption observed the effect of shear stress on barrier permeability and how it can be manipulated through ultra - sound frequency and microbubble oscillation dynamics [ 153 ] . Large microbubble - induced shear stress was determined to induce larger pores which could cause gap formation between cells [ 153 ] . Ultrasound settings , microbubble dosage and dynamics , and how often treatment is applied can all affect the degree of penetration and inﬂammation due Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 14 of 23 to USMB treatment , as well as the amount of cargo delivery . While increasing the pene - tration has been linked to increased cargo delivery to underlying tissue , the safety of the procedure must be weighed against the effectiveness . Optimization of all of these param - eters is recommended for the application of safe therapy while inducing cargo delivery with USMB . 3 . 2 . Tissue ( Depth ) Penetration and Speciﬁcity for the Lung Another feasibility issue is the degree to which thoracic ultrasound can penetrate the edematous or consolidated lung . Thoracic ultrasound has a maximum tissue penetration of about 10 cm , which would theoretically permit access to most of the average - sized human thorax ( e . g . , a chest circumference of 38 inches is a radius of ≈ 15 cm ) [ 154 ] . In the event that surface ultrasound does not permit sufﬁcient access , endobronchial ultrasound exists and would theoretically permit treatment of injured areas of the lung that are deep under the surface . For USMB to be used in clinical practice in humans , one could envisage development of a speciﬁc clam - shell - shaped ultrasound transducer that would permit simultaneous treatment of both the ventral and dorsal thorax . Finally , USMB is likely to be most effective in only the most severely injured lung regions ; residual air in less severely injured areas of the lung is likely to block the ultrasound energy . Speciﬁcally , whether the technique will work in areas where interstitial ( rather than alveolar ) edema predominates is uncertain . 3 . 3 . Optimizing Bubble Size and Charge for Delivery Efﬁcient delivery of cargo is affected by the properties of the microbubbles [ 155 ] . A par - ticularly important variable is bubble surface charge . In lipid - shelled bubbles , the lipids cho - sen can impart a charge property on the bubble ( e . g . , 1 , 2 - stearoyl - 3 - trimethylammonium - propane will lead to the generation of cationic microbubbles ) , and these properties have direct and measurable effects on the success of delivery . For example , genetic material in the systemic circulation is rapidly degraded , necessitating large amounts of genetic material to be injected , which may be unfeasible [ 156 ] . However , when nucleic acids were delivered with cationic microbubbles , their lifespan in the circulation was extended , leading to a lower required nucleic acid dose and a higher level of transfection [ 157 – 162 ] . This is a result of negatively charged nucleic acids coupling to the bubbles [ 163 ] . Bubble size is another important property that contributes to delivery capacity . In comparison to larger bubbles , smaller bubbles require higher ultrasound frequencies to undergo inertial cavitation [ 164 ] . Larger bubbles were found to achieve greater penetration depth of Evan’s blue dye and ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate in skin samples , suggesting that bigger bubbles are better for delivery [ 165 ] . However , large bubbles are more likely to cause detrimental blockage of the circulation ; larger bubbles also result in more local tissue damage [ 166 ] . These consequences must be considered when choosing the right bubble size for a given application . On the other end of the spectrum are nanobubbles , which are bubbles that are less than 1 micron in diameter [ 167 ] . Due to their very small size , they are able to traverse intercellular gaps and deposit deep into tissues , perhaps making them less desirable to endothelial transfection . They are desirable for applications such as tumor targeting , where they are able to inﬁltrate deep into the tumor for treatment [ 168 ] . They were also shown to be safer to cells than microbubbles , causing transfection in an in vitro model without impacting cell viability [ 169 ] . However , a major limitation of nanobubbles is the possibility of extravasation at other vascular sites , thus decreasing the amount deposited at the tissue of interest [ 170 ] . Nonetheless , their increased stability makes them an interesting avenue for endothelial delivery . 3 . 4 . Emerging Techniques to Control Bubble Sizes and Charge Most of the current USMB - mediated drug / gene delivery studies use commercial microbubble ultrasound contrast agents ( such as SonoVue ® , DEFINITY ® , OPTISON ® ) [ 171 ] . Biomedicines 2021 , 9 , 803 15 of 23 Some studies also use custom - made bubbles which are prepared by either sonication or a mechanical agitation method [ 171 ] . This method of preparation often leads to polydisperse microbubbles with varying mean sizes [ 171 ] . The resonance frequency of microbubbles ( i . e . , ultrasound frequency at which the maximum amplitude of oscillation occurs ) depends on the size of the microbubbles [ 86 ] . For example , smaller bubbles have a higher resonance frequency compared to larger bubbles , and the maximum amplitude of oscillation of smaller bubbles is less than larger bubbles because of increased damping [ 86 ] . Therefore , when polydisperse microbubbles are insonated , only a small fraction of the total population microbubbles resonate , which may negatively affect the drug / gene delivery efﬁcacy [ 86 ] . One way to solve this problem is to use emerging microﬂuidic techniques which are capable of generating monodisperse microbubble populations . Using carefully designed microchannels and appropriate ﬂow rates , monodisperse microbubbles of varying mean sizes can be generated at a high throughput [ 172 – 174 ] . Moreover , the shell properties ( such as composition , charge ) of the microbubbles can be varied by using different lipid mixtures in the continuous phase . Apart from microbubbles , microﬂuidics can also be used to generate monodisperse nanobubbles , as reported in a recent study [ 175 ] . Microﬂuidics thus provides a promising alternative to conventional agitation / sonication techniques for generating monodisperse bubbles , which could maximize the efﬁciency of USMB - mediated drug / gene delivery . 3 . 5 . Clinical Trials of USMB Treatment for ARDS The use of USMB treatment to enhance drug delivery for tissues in the digestive tract has been supported in recent clinical trials . Improvement in delivery of chemotherapeutic drug to target tissue has been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer , as well as various ma - lignant tumors of hepatic and pancreatic organs [ 176 , 177 ] . These studies concluded that USMB - enhanced treatment improved patient outcome without additional toxicity or side effects compared to chemotherapeutic treatment alone . However , given the novelty of USMB treatment for injured lung tissue ( ﬁrst published in 2018 ) , USMB has not yet been attempted in clinical trials for ARDS or lobar pneumonia [ 147 ] . Once sufﬁcient in vitro and in vivo evidence has accumulated on the effectiveness and safety of USMB treatment for injured lung tissue , clinical trials are likely to follow [ 178 ] . 4 . Conclusions—A New Technique Provides New Opportunities ARDS is a major cause of death after respiratory infection , whether from existing or emerging viral and bacterial pathogens . The pulmonary endothelium plays a signiﬁcant role in the development and progression of ARDS , where loss of barrier integrity and exces - sive inﬂammation drive pulmonary edema . Current treatments are unable to speciﬁcally target the most injured pulmonary endothelium due to the heterogeneity of lung damage in any given patient . Because air scatters ultrasound energy , USMB - mediated cargo delivery is an attractive method that will preferentially target the most injured areas of the lung , sparing relatively aerated regions . Even in the absence of diffuse disease , USMB could also be used in the setting of a dense , lobar consolidation . In principle , this technique could be used to deliver small molecule or genetic agents that enhance endothelial barrier integrity , stimulate endothelial repair , and prevent excessive endothelial cell activation . Finally , the ability to deliver drugs and potentially genetic material preferentially to non - aerated lung in vivo is likely to be useful in determining the pathogenesis of lung diseases even beyond ARDS . For instance , this technique might facilitate research into the pathogenesis and treatment of lung ﬁbrosis or lung malignancy . Although the ﬁeld is young , ultrasound - microbubble - mediated drug and gene delivery has the potential to be a valuable tool to understand and to treat the severely injured lung . 5 . Patents W .
