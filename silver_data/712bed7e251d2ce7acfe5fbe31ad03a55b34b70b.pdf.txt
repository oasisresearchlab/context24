However , how mechanical forces are translated into biochemical signals that coordinate the structural changes observed at the plasma membrane ( PM ) and the underlying cytoskeleton during mechanoadaptation is unclear . Here , we show that PM mechanoadaptation is controlled by a tension - sensing pathway composed of c - Abl tyrosine kinase and membrane curvature regulator FBP17 . FBP17 is recruited to caveolae to induce the formation of caveolar rosettes . FBP17 de ﬁ cient cells have reduced rosette density , lack PM tension buffering capacity under osmotic shock , and cannot adapt to mechanical strain . Mechanistically , tension is transduced to the FBP17 F - BAR domain by direct phosphorylation mediated by c - Abl , a mechanosensitive molecule . This modi ﬁ cation inhibits FBP17 membrane bending activity and releases FBP17 - controlled inhi - bition of mDia1 - dependent stress ﬁ bers , favoring membrane adaptation to increased tension . This mechanoprotective mechanism adapts the cell to changes in mechanical tension by coupling PM and actin cytoskeleton remodeling . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13782 - 2 OPEN 1 Mechanoadaptation and Caveolae Biology Laboratory , Cell and Developmental Biology Area , Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares ( CNIC ) , Melchor Fernández Almagro , 3 , 28029 Madrid , Spain . 2 Proteomics Unit , Vascular Pathophysiology Area , Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares ( CNIC ) , Melchor Fernández Almagro , 3 , 28029 Madrid , Spain . 3 Molecular Mechanics of the Cardiovascular System Laboratory , Cell and Developmental Biology Area , Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares ( CNIC ) , Melchor Fernández Almagro , 3 , 28029 Madrid , Spain . 4 Membrane Mechanics and Dynamics of Intracellular Signaling Laboratory , Institut Curie – Centre de Recherche , PSL Research University , CNRS UMR3666 , INSERM U1143 , 75248 Paris , France . 5 The Institute for Molecular Bioscience , The University of Queensland , Brisbane , QLD 4072 , Australia . 6 Department of Molecular Medicine , Sapienza University , Rome , Italy . 7 Departamento de Ciencia y Tecnología de Polímeros , Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea , 20018 Donostia - San Sebastián , Spain . 8 Donostia International Physics Center , Manuel Lardizabal Ibilbidea , 4 , 20018 Donostia - San Sebastián , Spain . 9 The Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis , The University of Queensland , Brisbane , QLD 4072 , Australia . 10 Present address : Departamento de Biología , Universidad Autónoma de Madrid , Cantoblanco , 28049 Madrid , Spain . * email : aecharri @ cnic . es ; madelpozo @ cnic . es NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5828 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13782 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; M any physiological processes , including embryo devel - opment , wound healing , organ homeostasis , lipid sto - rage and muscle activity , are exposed to various types of potentially damaging mechanical forces 1 , 2 . The plasma mem - brane ( PM ) acts as a protecting barrier that must accommodate the ﬂ uctuations in tension derived from mechanical action , which is essential to prevent its rupture upon excessive force . The proper adaptation of the cell to these tensional forces ( i . e . , cell mechanoadaptation ) requires a tension - sensing mechanism ide - ally able to transduce this signal and initiate the changes needed to maintain cell and tissue integrity . PM remodeling is an essential step during this adaptation 3 , 4 . Concomitant to PM remodeling , stress ﬁ bers , which are tightly coupled to the PM 5 , 6 , are highly sensitive to tension changes 7 . The tension - sensing pathways that remodel the PM and stress ﬁ bers during the adaptation to tension changes are still poorly understood . The lipid bilayer is intrinsically fragile and evolution has developed complex mechanisms that contribute to prevent its rupture and to ﬁ x membrane wounds produced by excessive mechanical stress 8 , 9 . Local changes in the curvature of PM domains play an important role in preventing membrane rupture 4 , 10 . One of these membrane curvatures is exempli ﬁ ed by caveolae , which are small PM invaginations shaped by caveolins and cavins 11 . Caveolin1 ( Cav1 ) and 3 are required to form caveolae in non - muscle and muscle cells , respectively , while cavin1 is needed in all tissues where caveolae are detected by electron microscopy ( EM ) 12 , 13 . In addition to these main caveolar components , other membrane curvature - generating molecules play a role in caveolae dynamics 14 – 18 . Re ﬂ ecting a tight coupling with the cytoskeleton , caveolar dynamics are also highly depen - dent on stress ﬁ ber regulators , including formin mDia1 and Abl kinases 5 , 19 . Caveolae have the ability to ﬂ atten out in response to osmotic swelling and stretching , allowing the PM to reduce its tension , which prevents membrane rupture and protects cells exposed to mechanical insults , both in cultured cells and in vivo 4 , 20 – 23 . Mutations in CAV1 , CAV3 , and CAVIN1 lead to muscular dystrophies , lipodystrophy , and other phenotypes , which may be explained at least in part by such mechan - oprotective role of caveolae 9 , 24 . Interestingly , the signaling capa - city of Cav3 , in addition to its mechanoprotective role , is altered in myotubes expressing CAV3 mutations found in muscular dystrophy patients 25 . Caveolae are frequently organized in clus - ters of different caveolar density that are connected with the PM through larger invaginations or shared necks ; these structures are collectively named caveolar rosettes and are abundant in mechanically stressed tissues 19 , 26 . EHD proteins , recruited to the caveolar neck , have been recently shown to be involved in their formation 27 . Many PM remodeling activities , such as ﬁ lopodia , lamellipo - dium extension , and endocytosis / exocytosis or membrane ruf ﬂ es , are coupled to actin cytoskeleton reorganization 6 . In many of these processes , BAR proteins play an important role 28 . The BAR protein family is characterized by the presence of a BAR domain , which has an intrinsic curvature that forces the PM to bend 29 – 31 . Various proteins of this family regulate clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis 28 , 31 – 34 . The F - BAR subfamily member FBP17 ( formin - binding protein 17 ) binds PIP2 and phosphati - dylserine and oligomerizes through its N - terminal F - BAR domain , resulting in a strong membrane bending and tubulation activity 31 , 35 , 36 . Interestingly , FBP17 and its Drosophila homolog Cip4 / Toca1 activate Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization and inhibit the stress ﬁ ber regulator Diaphanous ( mDia1 – 3 in mammals ) , respectively 35 , 37 , highlighting the importance of these proteins in coordinating membrane remodeling and actin cytos - keleton dynamics . FBP17 directly binds mDia1 38 , which is downstream of c - Abl in the pathway that links caveolae to stress ﬁ bers 5 . Here we identify FBP17 as a regulator of caveolar rosette assembly , PM tension adaptation , and stress ﬁ ber formation . In response to mechanical strain , FBP17 - dependent membrane bending and stress ﬁ ber regulation are shut down by a direct inhibitory phosphorylation on its F - BAR domain by c - Abl kinase . C - Abl senses tension and possesses a mechanosensitive actin - binding domain that regulates its kinase activity needed to inhibit FBP17 . Thus regulation of FBP17 by c - Abl allows a coordinated response of the PM and stress ﬁ bers to increased tension , which is important to mechanoprotect the cell . Results FBP17 favors the assembly of caveolar rosettes . In order to identify proteins regulating caveolae biology , we screened a panel of candidates using a Cav1 inward traf ﬁ cking assay . Upon loss of cell adhesion , a pool of PM - localized Cav1 moves from the PM to the endomembrane system in vitro and in vivo 39 , 40 . During this process , caveolar domains reorganize and clusters of caveolae are increased in the initial stages of the route 5 . During this reorga - nization of caveolar domains , membrane curvature is an obvious feature observed in EM images , not only in caveolae per se but also in the surrounding areas between caveolae of rosettes 11 , 40 , 41 . Although several caveolar components can induce local mem - brane curvature 17 , 42 – 44 , we hypothesized that additional curva - ture regulators could be involved in regulating curvature locally in caveolar domains . The membrane curvature regulators of the BAR family 28 , 45 have already been linked , directly or indirectly , to caveolae 16 , 17 , 46 , 47 . Therefore , we screened various BAR proteins and used the Cav1 inward traf ﬁ cking assay as a mean to test whether these proteins interfere with Cav1 and / or caveolae in any way . We ef ﬁ ciently silenced pacsin2 , SNX9 , cip4 , toca1 , FBP17 , and dynamin2 ( positive control , Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Pacsin2 inhibited the traf ﬁ cking of Cav1 to the perinuclear area , in accordance with recently published results 48 , validating our approach ( Fig . 1a ) . SNX9 , toca1 , or cip4 silencing did not interfere with Cav1 traf ﬁ cking . In contrast , FBP17 silencing blocked traf ﬁ cking similar to dynamin2 and pacsin2 ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . An additional small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) against FBP17 showed a similar effect ( Fig . 1a ) . To con ﬁ rm this result and to determine the stage in which FBP17 was acting , we stably silenced FBP17 using a different RNA interference target sequence in human ﬁ broblasts ( Fig . 1b ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of the PM pool of endogenous Cav1 showed that in FBP17 - silenced cells Cav1 moved away from the PM at a lower rate than control cells ( Fig . 1c ) , suggesting a defect in the early stages of caveolae redistribution in detached cells . Next , we studied the localization of endogenous FBP17 . The antibody for FBP17 has been previously characterized , and we further assessed its speci ﬁ city by absence of staining on FBP17 knockout ( KO ) cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1b – e ) . In wild - type cells , a fraction of FBP17 - positive spots either colocalized with or were adjacent to Cav1 spots ( Fig . 1d ) . This fraction was reduced upon arti ﬁ cial lateral displacement of one of the channels , suggesting that the observed spatial correlation is speci ﬁ c ( Fig . 1e ) . Cav1 and caveolae tend to drift and cluster upon disruption of the actin cytoskeleton 19 , therefore if FBP17 was part of caveolar structures , disruption of the actin cytoskeleton should force FBP17 to co - cluster with Cav1 spots . Cytochalasin D ( Cyt D ) treatment induced co - clustering of Cav1 and FBP17 ( Fig . 1d ) as re ﬂ ected by a signi ﬁ cant increase in the proportion of FBP17 spots colocalizing with Cav1 spots ( Fig . 1f ) .

Furthermore , live imaging of Cav1 - mRFP + GFP - FBP17 or Cherry - FBP17 + Cav1 - GFP revealed that both molecules moved together , frequently in clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 2c – f ) . Analysis of the localization of FBP17 by a recently developed EM - based high - resolution technique termed APEX - GBP 49 showed that some FBP17 localized around caveolar domains in single caveolae and in caveolar clusters containing tubular structures ( Fig . 2a ) . Similarly , detailed analysis by immuno - gold EM ( I - EM ) showed that endogenous FBP17 was associated with caveolar domains but showed a clear preference for caveolar rosettes ; while the majority of identi ﬁ ed rosettes contained gold particles , only a small fraction of caveolae showed gold particles ( Fig . 2b , c ) . FBP17 was preferably associated with the bulb of caveolae ( Fig . 2d ) , either in the small fraction of labeled single caveolae or in caveolae within rosettes . Although some gold particles present in rosettes were far from any visible caveolar bulb , the vast majority of gold was associated with the caveolar bulb ( Fig . 2e ) . We then analyzed whether FBP17 regulates the organization of Cav1 . Endogenous Cav1 staining renders a mixed population of spots of varying intensity and size , likely re ﬂ ecting different levels or caveolar organization 11 , 19 . Knockdown of FBP17 with two independent siRNAs ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) signi ﬁ cantly reduced the proportion of bright endogenous Cav1 spots , while that of dim spots was increased ( Fig . 3a ) . The total level of Cav1 was not altered by FBP17 knockdown ( Fig . 1b ) , suggesting that FBP17 speci ﬁ cally regulates the amount of caveolar clusters . Next , we quanti ﬁ ed the number of caveolar structures by EM in control ﬁ broblasts and ﬁ broblasts silenced for FBP17 . As shown in Fig . 3b , c , the number of rosettes , and caveolae associated with them , were signi ﬁ cantly reduced in cells silenced for FBP17 . Interestingly , the number of caveolae outside rosettes was unaffected upon FBP17 depletion ( Fig . 3c ) , suggesting that b c shControl shFBP17 Nucleus Cav1 a d e f Control Cyt D Cav1 FBP17 FBP17 Cav1 FBP17 GAPDH Cav1 82 kDa * * * * * * * * * * * – + 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 Offset images F r a c t i on o f F BP 17 s po t s a d j a c en t t o C a v 1 s po t s Control Cyt D 0 10 20 30 F r a c t i on o f F BP 17 s po t s on C a v 1 s po t s ( % ) s i C on t r o l s h C on t r o l s h F BP 17 s h C on t r o l s h F BP 17 s i D y na m i n 2 s i S N X 9 s i P a cs i n 2 s i F BP 17 # 2 s i F BP 17 # 1 s i C I P 4 s i T O C A 1 0 50 100 150 C a v 1 - G F P i n w a r d t r a ff i ck i ng ( % o f c on t r o l ) 0 25 50 75 100 E ndogenou s C a v 1 endo cy t o s i s 37 kDa 19 kDa Fig . 1 FBP17 regulates inward traf ﬁ cking of Cav1 and localizes with Cav1 . a Depletion of FBP17 , dynamin2 and pacsin2 , but not other BAR proteins , blocks Cav1 - GFP inward traf ﬁ cking .

Rosettes were surface - connected as they were positive for ruthenium red ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) , which labels surface - connectivity . Depending on the section of the cut , rosettes may appear in the cell interior , with or without a visible neck ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Rosettes contain at least two differ - entiated structures , the large invagination and the caveolae that are formed around this invagination ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . The large invaginations may ( in which case we term them “ rosettes ” ) or may not contain caveolae ( “ large invagination , ” Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Since the number of rosettes decreases upon FBP17 silen - cing , it could be that either FBP17 is required for caveolae formation exclusively in rosettes ( in which case we should observe an increase in large invaginations in cells silenced for FBP17 , proportional to the decrease in rosettes ) or FBP17 is involved in the formation of the large invagination that holds caveolae , and therefore indirectly caveolae within , in which case we should observe either a similar or lower number of large invaginations in cells silenced for FBP17 . Quanti ﬁ cation of surface - connected large invaginations showed that these were similar in the absence of FBP17 ( shControl 1 . 82 ± 0 . 4 and shFBP17 1 . 75 ± 0 . 3 / 100 μ m PM , t Student p value 0 . 89 ) , suggesting that FBP17 is speci ﬁ cally required for the formation of rosettes but is not required for the large invaginations without caveolae . To further con ﬁ rm these results , we knocked out the FBP17 in RPE - 1 cells ( Fig . 3d ) . Analogous results were observed in this system : rosettes were signi ﬁ cantly reduced , while caveolae outside rosettes were unaffected , and total caveolae density was slightly reduced ( Fig . 3e , f ) . Next , we asked what happens to Cav1 pools localized to caveolar rosettes when these are impaired upon FBP17 depletion . I - EM showed that Cav1 signal was ( i ) increased in caveolae outside rosettes and PM , ( ii ) reduced in rosettes and surface - connected vesicles , and ( iii ) unaffected at other cellular regions ( Supplementary Fig . 3b – d ) , suggesting that , upon rosette disappearance due to reduced FBP17 levels , Cav1 redistributes to the PM and caveolae outside rosettes . Taken together , these observations support the hypothesis that FBP17 is speci ﬁ cally required for the formation of caveolar rosettes . FBP17 is mechanoprotective and regulates PM tension . Caveolae protect cells from osmotic swelling 4 . Thus we investi - gated whether FBP17 contributes to cell mechanoprotection given its requirement for rosette formation . Cells knocked down for FBP17 were more sensitive to tension increase triggered by cell swelling and were damaged more easily than control cells , a b c d Gold particles in rosettes In bulb Outsidebulb e * * * SinglecaveolaeRosettes 0 25 50 75 100 % o f c a v eo l a r s t r u c t u r e s w i t h go l d F BP 17 MT MT PM ER Cav CCV Mito Mito End Mito PM PM PM Fig . 2 FBP17 is localized in caveolae and caveolar rosettes . a EM of cells expressing GFP - FBP17 .

Similarly , ﬁ broblasts knocked down for FBP17 were more sensitive to prolonged mechanical stretching treatments ( Fig . 4b ) , albeit effects induced by short treatments ( 30 min ) were not signi ﬁ cant ( Supplementary Fig . 3f ) . Of note , neither FBP17 transcript nor protein levels were affected by prolonged mechanical stretching ( Supplementary Fig . 3g , h ) . These results suggest that FBP17 is mechanoprotective . Although rosettes are known to disassemble upon osmotic swelling 20 , whether the large invagination of the rosette is also mechanosensitive is not known . We analyzed the kinetics of PM remodeling upon osmotic swelling . The disassembly of caveolae was fast and reversible , as published 4 ( Fig . 4c – g ) ; on the contrary , the disassembly of rosettes , was biphasic , i . e . , ﬁ rst caveolae within rosettes were disassembled ( by 2 min ) but the large invagination disassembled in a second phase ( 10 min ) ( Fig . 4c – g ) . Caveolae within rosettes were more sensitive to osmotic shock as compared to caveolae outside of rosettes , in accordance with previous observations 4 , 5 , 20 . Importantly , these rearrangements are rever - sible because rosettes , caveolae , and large invaginations were a b c e 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 q1 q2 q3 q4 q1 q2 q3 q4 P r opo r t i on o f C a v 1 s po t s ( % ) siControl siFBP17 # 1 siFBP17 # 2 * * * * * * Intensity quartiles * * * shControl s h C on t r o l shFBP17 s h F B P 17 s h C on t r o l s h F B P 17 s h C on t r o l s h F B P 17 s h C on t r o l s h F B P 17 C on t r o l K O F B P 17 f RPE1 RPE1 FBP17 KO R P E 1 R P E 1 F B P 17 K O R P E 1 R P E 1 F B P 17 K O R P E 1 R P E 1 F B P 17 K O R P E 1 R P E 1 F B P 17 K O d FBP17 α - Tubulin 75 kDa 50 kDa * * * 0 5 10 15 20 Rosettes E v en t s / 100 μ m E v en t s / 100 μ m E v en t s / 100 μ m E v en t s / 100 μ m E v en t s / 100 μ m E v en t s / 100 μ m * * * 0 20 40 60 80 Caveolae in rosettes Caveolae in rosettes ns 0 50 100 150 E v en t s / 100 μ m 0 50 100 150 Caveolae outside rosettes * Total caveolae * * 0 2 4 6 8 * 0 5 10 15 ns 0 20 40 60 E v en t s / 100 μ m 0 20 40 60 Caveolae outside rosettes ns Total caveolae Rosettes NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13782 - 2 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5828 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13782 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 reassembled after removal of the hypo - osmotic challenge ( Fig . 4c – g ) . Disappearance of rosettes was not due to endocytosis as determined by I - EM , because the signal associated with caveolar domains upon hypo - osmotic shock decreased for Cav1 and remained constant in the case of FBP17 but increased for both proteins in PM regions without curvature ( Supplementary Fig . 3i , j ) . Furthermore , the signal outside caveolar domains and PM did not increase ( Supplementary Fig . 3i , j ) . Such enrichment speci ﬁ cally at non - caveolar regions of the PM , while excluding intracellular compartments , suggests that any redistribution of Cav1 or FBP17 induced by hypo - osmotic shock is not likely derived from endocytic mechanisms . Based on these results , we hypothesized that FBP17 was important to control PM tension variations . As shown in Fig . 4h , cells knocked down for FBP17 had increased tension at the PM after osmotic shock , consistent with their higher sensitivity to hypo - osmotic shock and cell stretching and their signi ﬁ cant reduction in rosettes ( Fig . 3 ) . In order to determine whether FBP17 regulates membrane tension variations and sensitivity to mechanical stress exclusively through caveolae , we deleted FBP17 in Cav1 KO cells ( double KO cells ; Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . In double KO cells , membrane tension buffering under osmotic shock was similar to Cav1 KO cells and the sensitivity to mild hypo - osmotic shock ( 60 mOsm ) was also similar in both cell lines ( Fig . 4i , j ) . However , when osmolarity was further reduced ( 30 mOsm ) , double KO cells were more sensitive to osmotic swelling than parental Cav1 KO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Although PM tension changes could not be measured at this osmolarity due to technical limitations , these results suggest that FBP17 regulates additional pathways independent from caveolae , at least under low osmolarity conditions . EM analysis of double KO cells did not show any differences in large invaginations ( Cav1 KO MEFs 0 . 3 ± 0 . 12 / 100 μ m PM and double KO 0 . 34 ± 0 . 14 / 100 μ m PM , t Student p value 0 . 83 ) , suggesting that other activities of FBP17 were contributing to the mechanoprotection of the cell . FBP17 has been shown to be sensitive to osmotic swelling 50 ; we con ﬁ rmed this sensitivity by osmotic swelling and determined that this effect was reversible after shock release ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Osmotic swelling may have additional effects such as dilution of the proteins ; however , increased tension exerted by mechanical stretching of cells also reduced the number of FBP17 tubules ( Fig . 4k ) , indicating that FBP17 - generated membrane tubules are sensitive to mechanical stress . A kinase - dependent mechanism translates tension into FBP17 . To gain further mechanistic insight into how FBP17 senses ten - sion and contributes to the membrane remodeling observed during the adaptive response to mechanical strain , we explored potential underlying sensing molecular mechanisms . Although it has been shown that FBP17 per se can sense PM tension in vitro 50 , we observed that endogenous FBP17 was phosphory - lated on tyrosine residues after osmotic swelling in cells ( Fig . 5a ) , which could be related to the change in its tubulation activity observed using the same conditions . This phosphorylation occurred at 2 min of treatment and remained constant even after shock release ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) . c - Abl tyrosine kinase regulates caveolae organization and traf ﬁ cking and other BAR proteins are phosphorylated by c - Abl 51 , 52 . We tested whether c - Abl phosphorylates FBP17 . In cells , exogenously expressed c - Abl strongly phosphorylated FBP17 but not an unrelated control protein ( Fig . 5b ) . Most importantly , endogenous FBP17 phos - phorylation was completely inhibited by c - Abl inhibition ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Puri ﬁ ed c - Abl was also capable of phosphorylating ef ﬁ ciently a GST - FBP17 fusion protein in vitro but not glutathione S - transferase ( GST ; Fig . 5e ) . Moreover , immunoprecipitation of GFP - c - Abl from cell lysates , but not green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) control , co - immunoprecipitated myc - FBP17 ( Fig . 5f ) and endogenous FBP17 co - immunoprecipitated with endogenous c - Abl ( Fig . 5g ) . Moreover , both proteins signi ﬁ cantly colocalized in cells ( Fig . 5h , i ) . If c - Abl - induced phosphorylation is involved in the transduc - tion of increased tension and the regulation of PM remodeling , then c - Abl expression might inhibit FBP17 - dependent mem - brane - bending activity . As shown in Fig . 6a – b , c - Abl over - expression strongly reduced the amount of GFP - FBP17 tubules , without affecting FBP17 protein levels ( Fig . 6c ) . In order to determine whether c - Abl - induced phosphorylation was directly responsible for the reduced tubulation activity of FBP17 , we identi ﬁ ed by mass spectrometry the speci ﬁ c FBP17 tyrosine residues phosphorylated by c - Abl in vitro . This analysis identi ﬁ ed residues Y190 , Y205 , and Y287 as major phosphorylation sites . Mutation of these residues to phenylalanine ( FBP17 3YF ) signi ﬁ cantly reduced osmotic swelling - induced FBP17 phosphor - ylation in vivo ( Fig . 6d , e ) and phosphorylation by c - Abl in vitro ( Supplementary Fig . 5c , d ) . Since phosphorylation of endogenous FBP17 was fully dependent on endogenous c - Abl ( Fig . 5c , d ) , taken together , these results suggest that FBP17 is phosphorylated by c - Abl in cells on those three residues in response to osmotic swelling . Interestingly , these three residues are located within the F - BAR domain of FBP17 , which could explain the inhibitory effect of c - Abl expression over FBP17 tubulation activity . To test this possibility , we mutated the three tyrosine residues to glutamic acid , to create a phosphomimetic mutant . FBP17 3YE distributed diffusely throughout the cytosol and was virtually unable to form any tubule or puncta , contrary to the wild - type form , either in wild - type cells ( Fig . 6f , g ) or in FBP17 KO reconstituted cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5e , f ) . As expected , the non - phosphorylatable FBP17 mutant 3YF produced more tubules than the wild - type form ( Supplementary Fig . 5g ) and was insensitive to the inhibitory effect of co - expressed c - Abl ( Supplementary Fig . 5h ) .

Because dimerization of many BAR proteins , including FBP17 , is a required property for their membrane tubulation activity 36 , 53 , we assessed the dimerization capacity of FBP17 3YE through co - immunoprecipitation assays . The 3YE mutant exhibited a weak interaction with the wild - type protein , as compared to the robust co - immunoprecipitation of the wild - type / wild - type protein pair ( Fig . 6j , k ) . Thus a direct consequence of c - Abl - mediated phosphorylation in the FBP17 F - BAR domain is the inhibition of its membrane - bending activity . To determine whether phosphorylation is important to inhibit FBP17 membrane - bending activity in vivo in response to tension increase , we compared the membrane tubulation activity of wild - type FBP17 and 3YF , which is not phosphorylatable , under different hypo - osmotic conditions . At low osmolarity conditions ( 30 mOsm ) , no signi ﬁ cant differences were observed between both proteins ( Supple - mentary Fig . 5m , n ) . However , the 3YF mutant was insensitive to milder osmotic shock ( 60 mOsm ) , as compared to cells expressing the wild - type FBP17 ( Fig . 6l , m ) .

Because c - Abl - dependent phosphorylation of FBP17 is an event triggered by PM tension increases and c - Abl is associated with the PM and actin cytos - keleton 54 , we wondered whether c - Abl possesses intrinsic mechanosensing activity . In order to test this hypothesis , we ﬁ rst assessed whether c - Abl activity is regulated by mechanical sti - muli . c - Abl kinase activity was signi ﬁ cantly increased in cells exposed to hypo - osmotic swelling , either at 60 or 30 mOsm ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Activation occurred relatively fast as it was already detectable 2 min after the shock and remained constant after shock release , consistent with FBP17 phosphorylation kinetics ( Fig . 7b ) . Furthermore , endogenous c - Abl activity was elevated by a stiff substrate and mechanical stretching ( Fig . 7c , d ) , suggesting that c - Abl is regulated by tension changes from different forms of mechanical stimuli ( Fig . 7e ) . This sensitivity to mechanical sti - muli could be due to the intrinsic mechanosensitive properties of c - Abl or to its activation by a mechanosensitive upstream molecule . A clear candidate to transduce mechanical stimuli to c - Abl was Src , but c - Abl was equally activated by osmotic shock in Src / Fyn / Yes KO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . Mechanosensitive proteins frequently bind F - actin , such as talin , myosin , or ﬁ lamin A 55 . c - Abl binds F - actin , and binding to F - actin is important to regulate its kinase activity in vitro and in vivo 56 . Interestingly , the crystal structures of the actin - binding domains ( ABDs ) of c - Abl and Abl2 show strong structural homology to structural domains of mechanosensitive molecules , such as Talin , vinculin , FAK , and α - catenin 57 , 58 . Speci ﬁ cally , the ABD domain of c - Abl and Abl2 show the strongest structural homology to mechanosensitive domains of talin , which have been shown to unfold at low forces leading to exposure of cryptic - binding sites 57 – 59 . Thus we hypothesized that the ABD domain of c - Abl could be sensitive to mechanical forces , allowing c - Abl to sense mechanical stimuli and regulate its activity . In order to test this hypothesis , we stretched the ABD domain of c - Abl using single - molecule force spectroscopy by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) 60 ( Fig . 7f , g ) . To be able to ﬁ ngerprint single - molecule events , the ABD domain was fused to four titin I91 domains , whose mechanical properties are well characterized 61 . The resulting heteropolyprotein , which retains the F - actin - binding function of ABD ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) , was pulled at constant velocity ( force - extension , Fig . 7g ) or at monotonically increasing forces ( force - ramp , Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . We analyzed full - length single - molecule recordings in which the four I91 domains unfold , which ensures that the full - length heteropolyprotein , including the ABD domain , was under mechanical force . In force - extension traces , I91 unfolding events result in force peaks that correspond to changes in contour length of 28 – 29 nm , as estimated using the worm - like chain of polymer elasticity ( Fig . 7g ) 62 . In force - ramp recordings , I91 unfolding events are detected as stepwise changes in length of 24 – 25 nm ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . Fingerprinted single - molecule traces did not show speci ﬁ c mechanical features that can be unambiguously assigned to the ABD domain , although the ﬁ nal lengths of the single - molecule tethers are compatible with the ABD domain being unfolded at the end of the pulling protocol ( Fig . 7g , h and Supplementary Fig . 6d ) . Indeed , in 15 % of the force - ramp traces we did not detect any step other than those originating from I91 unfolding , suggesting that unfolding of ABD happens at forces below the ~ 10 pN detection limit of the AFM in those traces ( Supplementary Fig . 6e ) . For the remaining traces , we detected a heterogeneous population of steps at 45 ± 30 pN ( ±SD ) ( Supple - mentary Fig . 6f ) , although some of these events probably are not related to ABD and originate from spurious , non - speci ﬁ c inter - actions with the surface . Taking all the single - molecule AFM results together , we conclude that the ABD domain has low mechanical stability , a biophysical property hallmark of other well - established protein mechanosensors , such as talin rod domains 59 , 63 , β - catenin 64 , or the kinase domain of titin 65 . This conclusion is further supported by coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations of the unfolding of ABD with a pulling force . We ﬁ nd low ABD unfolding forces not only when the pulling geometry is end - to - end ( the same explored in the AFM experiments ) but also when the domain is pulled through a subset of residues involved in binding to actin ( Supplementary Fig . 6h – j ) . Taken together , these pieces of evidence support that c - Abl exhibits properties compatible with an intrinsic mechan - osensing activity , which potentially couple directly mechanical stimuli to the modulation of its kinase output . FBP17 couples tension - induced PM and stress ﬁ ber remodel - ing . Our results suggest that FBP17 is an important player in PM remodeling during the cell response to tension increase down - stream of c - Abl . During this adaptation , in addition to changes in membrane curvature , stress ﬁ bers are reinforced 7 . The cross - talk between PM and the actin cytoskeleton is evident at many levels . Notably , caveolae are tightly linked to stress ﬁ bers downstream of c - Abl and mDia1 5 . Therefore , we hypothesized that FBP17 could be essential during the cross - talk between mechanosensitive membrane invaginations and stress ﬁ bers in the cell response to mechanical strain . Indeed , FBP17 deletion in Cav1 KO cells further increases their sensitivity to osmotic shock , suggesting that FBP17 also contributes to cell adaptation to tension changes Fig . 6 Tension increase is translated into an inhibitory phosphorylation in the FBP17 F - BAR domain . a , b c - Abl inhibits FBP17 tubulation activity . c - Abl or empty vector were expressed with GFP - FBP17 in HeLa cells and c - Abl was stained and examined with confocal microscopy .

FBP17 expression in cells reduces stress ﬁ bers 66 and binds mDia1 in vitro 38 . Furthermore , cip4 , the only FBP17 family member in ﬂ ies , inhibits Diaphanous actin polymerization activity 37 . Since density of stress ﬁ bers positively correlate with PM tension increase 7 , stress ﬁ ber inhibitors ought to be blocked by tension . Several types of stress ﬁ bers have been characterized 7 , 67 . We quanti ﬁ ed the effect of FBP17 on the different types of stress ﬁ ber 67 , 68 ( Fig . 8a ) . FBP17 expression reduced dorsal stress ﬁ bers and transverse arcs and increased ventral stress ﬁ bers ( Fig . 8b , c ) . This effect is consistent with the inactivation of mDia1 , as silencing of mDia1 produces a similar phenotype 67 , 68 . In contrast , FBP17 3YE mutant did not modify dorsal ﬁ bers or transverse arcs , similar to GFP alone ( Fig . 8b , c ) . Next , we studied the effect on puri ﬁ ed proteins in an in vitro pyrene - actin polymerization assay ( Supplementary Fig . 6k ) . Puri ﬁ ed mDia1C ( the active fragment of mDia1 ; ref . 69 ) induced strong actin polymerization , as shown before ( Supplementary Fig . 6l ) 69 . Addition of FBP17 to mDia1C inhibited F - actin polymerization ( Fig . 8d ) . However , FBP17 3YE mutant was unable to inhibit mDia1C , similar to control GST ( Fig . 8d ) . Thus in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that FBP17 inhibits mDia1 - mediated actin polymerization and this is dependent on the tension - phosphorylated residues on the F - BAR domain . To understand the role of FBP17 phosphorylation in the context of mechanoprotection , we studied the sensitivity of cells to hypo - osmotic shock in FBP17 - silenced cells rescued with FBP17 or the phosphomimetic form ( 3YE ) . While FBP17 re - expression rescued the protection against osmotic swelling , the FBP17 3YE mutant , de ﬁ cient for membrane bending and null for mDia1 inhibition , did not ( Fig . 8e ) . Consistent with this , inhibition of c - Abl , which reduces FBP17 phosphorylation on those residues ( Figs . 5 and 6d , e ) , had a protective effect ( Fig . 8f ) . Together these results suggest that both activities of FBP17 , membrane bending and stress ﬁ ber inhibition , are important to protect the cell against osmotic swelling . Discussion The morphological changes in the PM and the cytoskeleton in response to mechanical strain are evident by imaging techniques 1 , 7 , 20 , but the molecular mechanisms that underlie those changes and their functional consequences are not well understood . Here we identify a kinase - based tension - sensing pathway that controls the membrane - bending activity of FBP17 by directly phosphorylating the F - BAR domain in response to tension increase , which impedes its membrane - bending activity and stress ﬁ ber inhibition . This pathway ensures a coordinated response at the PM and cytoskeleton , allowing cell survival upon excessive tension . Upon tension increase , many molecular chan - ges occur in the cell , which globally contributes to adapt the cell to the new mechanical properties of the surrounding matrix and / or cells . c - Abl kinase is activated by many stress responses 54 and here we show that it is also sensitive to mechanical stimuli . The biophysical properties of the c - Abl ABD domain could confer intrinsic mechanosensitivity to tension increase . The structural similarity between the ABD domains of c - Abl / Arg and well - characterized mechanosensitive domains , such as the R1 domain in Talin ( R1 domain ) 57 , 58 , 63 or those in FAK 70 or α - catenin 71 , suggests that the ABD is a potential mechanosensing domain that couples mechanical stimuli with the regulation of c - Abl activity and its target substrates , such as FBP17 . The current model for talin mechanosensitive properties suggests that the treadmilling of actin due to polymerization could unfold mechanosensitive domains 72 . Equivalent mechanical unfolding of the ABD domain in c - Abl could lead to increased accessibility of the kinase active site . Indeed , the F - actin - binding properties of the ABD are essential to control c - Abl activity in vivo and in vitro 56 , but how it does so remains unclear . The activation of c - Abl by tension increase leads to the phosphorylation of the F - BAR domain of FBP17 , which inhibits its membrane - bending activity and inhibition on mDia1 in cells and in vitro ( Figs . 6 and 8 ) . In vitro and in silico models provide evidence that tension increase reduces protein – protein interac - tions using N - BAR proteins as a model and tension reduction facilitates the tubulation activity of endophilin A1 73 , 74 , whose tubulation activity is also regulated by phosphorylation in vitro 75 , similar to other BAR proteins 48 , 76 . These studies raise the pos - sibility that tension - driven regulation of BAR proteins may be a common mechanism used by cells to regulate the curvature of the membranes . Interestingly , in vitro assays using puri ﬁ ed protein suggest that FBP17 itself is mechanosensitive 50 . A combination of mechanisms , i . e . , intrinsic mechanosensitive properties and tension - triggered regulatory phosphorylation , could ensure that the membrane - bending activity is halted when tension at the PM is increased . Our results suggest that , under mild osmotic stimuli , the intrinsic mechanosensitive mechanism is not suf ﬁ cient to inhibit the membrane - bending activity of FBP17 , and a phosphorylation - based mechanism takes place ( Fig . 6l , m ) . This suggests that depending on the degree of tension different mechanisms of transduction take place . Phosphorylation could act as an irreversible signal that completely inhibits FBP17 activity , as reversal of tension to basal conditions does not reduce the phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Multiple FBP17 pools exist 50 and one of those pools is recruited to single caveolae , similar to other BAR proteins , such as pacsin2 . While pacsin2 and 3 are needed for the correct for - mation of caveolae 16 , 17 , 47 , FBP17 is not ( Fig . 3 ) . Interestingly , FBP17 is speci ﬁ cally required for the formation of caveolar rosettes , in accordance with the fact that , while the majority of the rosette - localized caveolae contain FBP17 , only a small fraction of single caveolae are labeled positive for this protein ( Fig . 2 ) . Tension decrease could recruit FBP17 to caveolae , as actin polymerization inhibition , resulting in reduced tension , augments FBP17 colocalization with Cav1 ( Fig . 1 ) . This recruitment to single caveolae could favor the local inhibition of mDia1 by FBP17 ( Fig . 8 ) , as observed in Drosophila 37 . Inhibition of mDia1 is known to induce the formation of rosettes 5 , which could explain the decrease of rosettes in FBP17 - silenced or - deleted cells ( Fig . 3 ) . Ensuring PM integrity is essential for cell survival and complex and diverse mechanisms exist to protect the PM . Tension relief appears to be an essential step in preventing membrane rupture 4 and the increased tension upon osmotic shock observed in FBP17 - silenced cells suggest that this may be responsible for the reduced protection in these cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Interestingly , Cav1 and FBP17 double KO cells are more sensitive to osmotic swelling than Cav1 KO cells , suggesting that caveolae - independent path - ways are regulated by FBP17 . In agreement , FBP17 is relatively highly expressed in tissues where caveolae are not particularly abundant , such as the brain , while it is poorly expressed ( in relative terms ) in the skeletal muscle or lung 36 , where caveolae are abundant . This suggests 36 that ( i ) FBP17 may have additional functions independent of caveolae 31 , 35 , 50 and / or ( ii ) that other F - BAR family members may play an analogous role in tissues where FBP17 is less abundant . The actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be important to mechanoprotect the cell , although the exact mechanism is still unclear 8 . The fact that the FBP17 3YE mutant , which cannot inhibit mDia1 , cannot protect cells from osmotic swelling ( Fig . 8 ) suggests that stress ﬁ ber regulation is important for ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13782 - 2 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 5828 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13782 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications mechanoprotection . Similar to FBP17 , EHD proteins are required for rosette formation , membrane stability , and stress ﬁ ber – caveolae linkage 15 , 27 , 77 , 78 . Additional studies will be needed to determine whether stress ﬁ bers , independent on caveolae , are important to mechanoprotect the cell .
