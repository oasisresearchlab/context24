Research Article Measurement of Individual Differences Lessons From Memory Assessment in Research and Clinical Practice Bob Uttl Institute of Psychology , University of Tsukuba , Tsukuba City , Japan ABSTRACT— An examination of test manuals and published research indicates that widely used memory tests ( e . g . , Verbal Paired Associates and Word List tests of the Wechs - ler Memory Scale , Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test , and California Verbal Learning Test ) are afﬂicted by se - vere ceiling effects . In the present study , the true extent of memory ability in healthy young adults was tested by giving 208 college undergraduates verbal paired - associate and verbal learning tests of various lengths ; the ﬁndings demonstrate that healthy adults can remember much more than is suggested by the normative data for the memory tests just mentioned . The ﬁndings highlight the adverse effects of low ceilings in memory assessment and under - score the severe consequences of ceiling effects on score distributions , means , standard deviations , and all variabil - ity - dependent indices , such as reliability , validity , and cor - relations with other tests . The article discusses the optimal test lengths for verbal paired - associate and verbal list - learning tests , shows how to identify ceiling - afﬂicted data in published research , and explains how proper attention to this phenomenon can improve future research and clinical practice . Standardized cognitive tests are used to measure individual differences for various purposes , including making diagnostic decisions , assessing impairments due to disease , tracking post - traumatic recovery , and conducting both basic and applied research . To achieve these objectives , a test must yield both valid and reliable data across the full range of the ability under assessment . Contrary to this requirement , test manuals and published research indicate that widely used memory tests , such as the Verbal Paired Associates and Word List tests from the Wechsler Memory Scales ( WMS ; Wechsler , 1945 , 1987 , 1997 ) , the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( RAVLT ; Rey , 1964 ; Spreen & Strauss , 1998 ) , and the California Verbal Learning Test ( CVLT ; Delis , Kramer , Kaplan , & Ober , 1987 ) , are afﬂicted with severe ceiling effects ( Graf & Uttl , 1995 ; Theisen , Rapport , Axelrod , & Brines , 1988 ; Trahan , Larrabee , Quintana , Goethe , & Willingham , 1989 ; Uttl & Graf , 2000 ; Uttl , Graf , & Richter , 2002 ) . The aim of this article is to highlight the adverse effects of low ceilings on commonly used tests of verbal paired - associate learning ( VPA ) and verbal list learning ( VL ) , as well as to es - tablish the optimal list length for these memory testing proce - dures and guidelines for detecting ceiling effects in published norms and research when only means and standard deviations ( rather than score distributions ) are available . Performance ceiling effects occur with tests that are relatively easy , when a substantial proportion of individuals obtain either maximum or near - maximum scores and cannot demonstrate the true extent of their abilities , resulting in score distributions that are com - pressed at the upper end of performance . Ceiling effects are undesirable : They limit the ability of tests to ferret out differ - ences among higher - scoring individuals ; they reduce the true range of scores ; and they underestimate variability among in - dividuals , thus biasing any derived scores whose computation uses the sample variability . The VPA from the WMS is among the most widely used VPA tests for assessing explicit episodic memory . The most recent revision ( WMS – III ; Wechsler , 1997 ) requires examinees to learn eight unrelated word pairs across four study - test trials , followed by 30 - min - delayed recall and recognition tests . The test yields several scores , including scores for memory Address correspondence to Bob Uttl , Institute of Psychology , Uni - versity of Tsukuba , Tsukuba City , Ibaraki 305 - 8572 , Japan ; e - mail : bob . uttl @ alfalab . com . PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE 460 Volume 16—Number 6 Copyright r 2005 American Psychological Society acquisition , learning , delayed recall , and delayed recognition . Similarly , the RAVLT requires examinees to learn a list of 15 unrelated words ( list A ) across ﬁve study - test trials ( A1 – A5 ) , learn a new list of 15 words in a single study - test trial ( B1 , interference trial ) , and then recall the list A words ( Trial A6 , short - delay recall ) . After a 20 - min delay , examinees are asked again to recall the list A words ( Trial A7 , long - delay recall ) ; an old / new recognition test follows ( Spreen & Strauss , 1998 ) . The various panels of Figure 1 highlight the severe ceiling effects observed on these tests , give examples of spurious re - search ﬁndings caused by low ceilings , and suggest that the answers to critical research questions provided by various studies in entire research areas might be determined by ceiling effects . Figure 1a shows performance ( sum of the ﬁrst three acquisition trials ) of the normative sample on the WMS – Revised VPA by age group , demonstrating that younger adults failed to recall , on average , only 2 out of 24 items over the three trials , which clearly indicates that their performance was limited by severe ceiling effects ( Wechsler , 1987 ) . Similarly , Graf and Uttl ( 1995 ) reported severe ceiling effects on the fourth and ﬁfth trial of RAVLT ; Figure 1b demonstrates that a large proportion of par - ticipants recalled all 15 words on the fourth trial ( A4 ) and thus could not demonstrate the true extent of their abilities . Figures 1c and 1d give examples of spurious interactions caused by ceiling - limited tests . Figure 1c shows the perfor - mance of 469 healthy people ages 20 to 89 years on the long - delay recall ( Trial A7 ) and recognition ( 15 old / 15 new ) compo - nents of the RAVLT ( from Squire & Kandel , 2000 , p . 202 ) . These data were described as showing ‘‘much less of an age difference [ decline ] on the recognition test [ than on the recall test ] ’’ ( Squire & Kandel , 2000 , p . 202 ) . Similarly , Figure 1d shows perfor - mance on the RAVLT recognition test by adults from four age groups , after either a 20 - min or a 1 - day delay ( Davis et al . , 2003 ) . Even though the authors observed and noted large ceiling effects in performance on preceding recall trials , they interpreted these old / new recognition data as showing ‘‘more rapid forgetting in the elderly’’ than in younger adults ( Davis et al . , 2003 , p . 1080 ) . However , Figure 1e shows that when the ceiling effects are minimized by administering only three study - test trials , age - related declines ( expressed in z scores , a com - parable metric ) on the RAVLT long - delay recall and recognition tests are comparable ( Uttl , 2005b ) . Unfortunately , the problem of ceiling effects is not limited to a few isolated studies . For example , a recent review of age - related declines in event - cued prospective memory ( Uttl , 2005a ) , based on more than 40 published articles and 120 experimental condi - tions comparing younger and older adults’ performance , con - cluded that the best predictor of age differences on prospective memory tasks is the severity of ceiling effects . Figure 1f shows that no age effects are observed when older adults’ performance is perfect , whereas the size of age effects increases linearly as performance of the older adults becomes more and more distant from perfect performance . Thus , contrary to the claims that event - cued prospective memory is special and spared by ag - ing ( Einstein & McDaniel , 1990 ; McDaniel , Einstein , Stout , & Morgan , 2003 ) , this ﬁgure shows that performance on event - cued prospective memory tasks declines with age , and that the size of such declines is determined primarily by the severity of ceiling effects . Specific objectives of the present investigation were as fol - lows : ( a ) to discover the true extent of memory abilities on VPA and VL tests ; ( b ) to examine the consequences of using easy tests on score distributions , standard deviations , reliability , validity , and , more generally , making decisions about individ - uals and interpreting research ﬁndings ; ( c ) to discover the op - timal test lengths for these two most popular testing procedures ( VPA and VL tests ) ; and ( d ) to develop empirically based guidelines on how to spot ceiling - limited performance when only means and standard deviations are available . METHOD Participants and Design Participants were 208 undergraduate student volunteers from Oregon State University , 18 to 39 years of age ( M 5 20 . 0 , SD 5 2 . 76 ) , who participated in this study for course credit . On av - erage , the participants had 13 . 4 years of education ( SD 5 1 . 47 ) , and the majority were women ( 68 . 4 % ) . The design had two between - subjects factors : test length ( i . e . , number of words on the VPA and VL tests , respectively : 8 / 24 , 12 / 21 , 16 / 18 , 20 / 15 , 24 / 12 , and 28 / 9 ) and test order ( VPA followed by VL and VL followed by VPA ) . Participants were randomly assigned to one of the 12 experimental conditions , and approximately equal num - bers of participants were assigned to each combination of test length and test order ( 8 / 24 : n 5 36 ; 12 / 21 : n 5 36 ; 16 / 18 : n 5 36 ; 20 / 15 : n 5 35 ; 24 / 12 : n 5 32 ; 28 / 9 : n 5 33 ) . The tests were administered as part of a larger battery of cognitive tests and experimental tasks . Assessment Instruments VPA Test Eighty - four concrete nouns were used to create 28 word triplets subject to the constraint that the words in each triplet were semantically unrelated to each other . Next , one word in each triplet was randomly selected to be a cue ( C ) word , another word was randomly chosen to be the A - list response , and the re - maining word was the B - list response . This procedure resulted in two lists of 28 semantically unrelated word pairs—list C - A and list C - B . Depending on the VPA test - length condition , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , or 28 word pairs were selected randomly from list C - A for each participant , and the word pairs with the same cue words were selected from list C - B . Both the C - A and the C - B lists were arranged randomly for each participant . The VPA test consisted of three auditorily presented study - test trials using List C - A ( Trials A1 , A2 , A3 ) , followed by one Volume 16—Number 6 461 Bob Uttl Fig . 1 . Examples of ceiling - afﬂicted performance , research ﬁndings , and conclusions . In ( a ) , performance of the normative sample on the Wechsler Memory Scale – Revised verbal paired - associate ( VPA ) test is shown as a function of age group ( Wechsler , 1987 ) . In ( b ) , performance on Trial A4 of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( RAVLT ) is shown as a function of age group ( Graf & Uttl , 1995 ) ; the dashed line at 12 items marks the maximum score of the Word List test of the Wechsler Memory Scale – III ( WMS – III ; the Word List test is patterned after RAVLT ) and demonstrates that the majority of participants could remember many more words than the maximum on that test . In ( c ) , a spurious interaction between the type of RAVLT test ( long - delay recall vs . recognition ) and age group is illustrated ( Squire & Kandel , 2000 ) . In ( d ) , a spurious interaction between test delay and age group is shown ( Davis et al . , 2003 ) . In ( e ) , results from a study of 351 adults ages 18 through 91 are shown ; long - delay recall and recognition performance on the Modiﬁed RAVLT ( i . e . , RAVLT with only three study - test trials ) in standardized units relative to the youngest age group is graphed as a function of age ( Uttl , 2005b ) . In ( f ) , the size of age declines ( i . e . , performance of young minus performance of old ) in prospective memory performance is graphed as a function of older adults’ per - formance ( Uttl , 2005a ) . 462 Volume 16—Number 6 Ceiling Effects and Measurement of Individual Differences study - test trial using List C - B ( Trial B1 ) , followed by a cued - recall test of List C - A ( Trial A4 ) , and , after a 15 - min delay , an - other cued - recall test of List C - A ( Trial A5 ) . In all other respects , the test was administered according to the published instruc - tions for the WMS – III Paired Associate Test ( Wechsler , 1997 ) . VL Test Forty - eight concrete nouns were used to create two lists of 24 semantically unrelated words by randomly assigning each word to either List A or List B subject to the constraint that the words in each list were semantically unrelated . Depending on the VL test - length condition , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , or 24 words were se - lected randomly from each list and arranged randomly for each participant . The VL test consisted of ﬁve auditorily presented study - test trials using List A ( Trials A1 – A5 ) , followed by one study - test trial using List B ( Trial B1 ) , followed by a free - recall test of List A ( Trial A6 ) and a second 20 - min - delayed free - recall test of List A ( Trial A7 ) . The test was administered according to the pub - lished instructions for RAVLT ( Spreen & Strauss , 1998 ) . Procedure All participants individually completed a 2 - hr battery of cog - nitive tests and experimental tasks including the VPA and VL tests . Depending on the test - order condition , each participant was administered the VPA test followed by the VL test or the VL test followed by the VPA test . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Score Distributions , Central Tendency , and Variability VPA Test The left column of Figure 2 shows box - and - whisker plots of performance on the VPA test by trial and test length for the 8 - , 16 - , and 28 - item lengths . The lower and upper edges of each box correspond to the 25th and 75th percentile , respectively ; the thick horizontal lines mark the medians ; and the whiskers extend to the largest and smallest values within 1 . 5 box lengths . The numbers above the box plots are the corresponding means and standard deviations ( in parentheses ) . For the 12 - item VPA test , the means ( standard deviations in parentheses ) were 4 . 6 ( 3 . 5 ) , 8 . 5 ( 3 . 2 ) , 10 . 3 ( 2 . 2 ) , 6 . 1 ( 3 . 4 ) , 9 . 2 ( 2 . 6 ) , and 10 . 1 ( 2 . 2 ) . For the 20 - item VPA test , the means ( and standard deviations ) were 5 . 6 ( 4 . 2 ) , 13 . 1 ( 4 . 7 ) , 17 . 5 ( 2 . 5 ) , 8 . 1 ( 5 . 4 ) , 16 . 3 ( 3 . 2 ) , and 17 . 7 ( 2 . 5 ) . For the 24 - item VPA test , the means ( and standard de - viations ) were 6 . 0 ( 4 . 8 ) , 14 . 5 ( 5 . 8 ) , 19 . 4 ( 4 . 7 ) , 9 . 1 ( 4 . 8 ) , 18 . 4 ( 5 . 0 ) , and 19 . 8 ( 4 . 3 ) . For the 8 - item test length ( used in WMS ) , the ﬁgure shows that the distributions of scores on all but the ﬁrst trials for a list ( A1 and B1 ) were limited by ceiling effects , resulting in skewed distributions ( indicated by a median shifted to the upper part of the box from the box center ) . Specifically , the maximum score corresponded to 75th - percentile performance on Trials A2 and A4 ( short - delay recall ) and to median performance ( 50th per - centile ) on Trial A3 ( last study - test trial using List A ) and A5 ( long - delay recall ) . Examination of the corresponding means and standard deviations shows that performance increased from an average of 3 . 4 items correct on Trial A1 to 7 . 1 on Trial A3 , while corresponding standard deviations decreased from 2 . 3 to 1 . 2 because of the low ceiling of an 8 - item test . More than 50 % of participants were unable to demonstrate their true memory ability , and the low ceiling resulted in attenuated means and standard deviations in the ceiling - limited conditions of the test ( see Uttl et al . , 2002 ) . As the length of the VPA test increased from 8 to 28 items ( word pairs ) , the ceiling effects became less and less pro - nounced . The 75th percentile was equal to the maximum score on both Trial A3 and Trial A5 for the 12 - , 16 - , and 20 - item tests and was equal to the maximum score on Trial 5 for the 24 - item test . The 75th percentile fell from the ceiling only when a list length of 28 items was used . Moreover , the score distributions were less skewed and standard deviations were less attenuated on longer than on shorter tests . The numbers just above the x - axis in Figure 2 indicate the percentages of examinees whose performance was at the ceiling , that is , who achieved the maximum score possible or the max - imum score minus 1 . These percentages indicate that a large proportion of examinees were at the ceiling for all but the longest VPA test . These results suggest that only the longest VPA test length— 28 items—is able to measure individual differences in at least 75 % of individuals . An even longer test is needed to measure individual differences when more than three study - test trials are used ( e . g . , WMS – III has four study - test trials ; Wechsler , 1997 ) . Alternatively , if one administers only two study - test trials , one can use a shorter 12 - or 16 - item VPA test with similar results ( Uttl et al . , 2002 ) . VL test The right column of Figure 2 shows box - and - whisker plots of performance on the VL test by trial and test length for the 12 - , 15 - , and 24 - item lengths , with means and standard deviations shown above the box plots . For the 9 - item VL test , the corre - sponding means ( standard deviations in parentheses ) were 6 . 0 ( 1 . 4 ) , 7 . 8 ( 1 . 1 ) , 8 . 3 ( 0 . 8 ) , 8 . 7 ( 0 . 6 ) , 8 . 6 ( 0 . 7 ) , 6 . 1 ( 1 . 4 ) , 7 . 6 ( 1 . 5 ) , and 7 . 7 ( 1 . 6 ) . For the 18 - item VL test , the means ( and standard deviations ) were 7 . 8 ( 2 . 6 ) , 11 . 6 ( 2 . 6 ) , 13 . 8 ( 2 . 7 ) , 14 . 7 ( 2 . 0 ) , 15 . 6 ( 1 . 9 ) , 7 . 9 ( 2 . 4 ) , 14 . 0 ( 2 . 9 ) , and 14 . 3 ( 2 . 9 ) . For the 21 - item VL test , the means ( and standard deviations ) were 9 . 2 ( 3 . 0 ) , 13 . 4 ( 3 . 4 ) , 15 . 4 ( 3 . 5 ) , 16 . 5 ( 3 . 1 ) , 17 . 3 ( 2 . 4 ) , 10 . 1 ( 3 . 2 ) , 15 . 1 ( 3 . 7 ) , and 15 . 6 ( 3 . 9 ) . The data show that the ceiling limits test scores for all com - monly used test lengths : 9 ( CVLT - 2 , short ) , 12 ( WMS – III Word List ) , and 15 ( RAVLT ) items . For these test lengths , the 75th percentile was equal to the maximum score on many of the Volume 16—Number 6 463 Bob Uttl Fig . 2 . Box - and - whisker plots of performance on the verbal paired - associate test ( left column ) and the verbal learning test ( right column ) by trial and test length . The lower and upper edges of each box correspond to the 25th and 75th percentile , respectively ; medians are marked by thick horizontal lines ; and whiskers extend to the largest and smallest values within 1 . 5 box lengths . The numbers above the box plots are the corresponding means and standard deviations ( in parentheses ) , whereas the numbers just above the x - axis indicate the percentages of examinees who achieved the maximum score or the maximum score minus 1 . The dotted lines mark the maximum scores . 464 Volume 16—Number 6 Ceiling Effects and Measurement of Individual Differences trials . Depending on the test length and specific trial , at least 25 % of participants were unable to demonstrate their true memory ability . As the test length increased from 9 to 24 items , the ceiling effects became less pronounced , and for the 24 - item test , only a few participants reached the maximum scores . The numbers just above the x - axis in Figure 2 show the percentages of examinees whose performance was at the ceiling , that is , who achieved the maximum score possible or the max - imum score minus 1 . These percentages indicate that a large proportion of examinees were at the ceiling for the shorter tests and that the proportion of examinees at the ceiling decreased for the longer tests . The data suggest that 18 - , 21 - , or 24 - item VL tests are able to measure individual differences in at least 75 % of individuals . Alternatively , one can administer fewer trials and use a shorter test . For example , Uttl ( 2005b ) shortened the 15 - item RAVLT test from ﬁve to three trials and normed it on a large sample of community - dwelling adults ranging from 18 to 91 years of age ( Uttl , 2005b ) . Intertrial Correlations ( Reliability ) VPA Test The adverse effects of low ceilings on VPA test reliability were examined using scatter plots and correlations between the scores achieved on the last learning trial ( A3 ) and the short - delay recall trial ( A4 ) for each test length . In general , intertrial correlations were smaller for shorter tests and larger on longer tests , ranging from . 75 for the 8 - item VPA test to . 97 and . 91 for the 24 - and 28 - item VPA tests , respectively . These results suggest that low ceilings adversely affect test reliability because of the attenuated variability of test scores . VL Test Similarly , the adverse effects of low ceilings on VL test relia - bility were examined using scatter plots and correlations be - tween the scores achieved on the last learning trial ( A5 ) and the short - delay recall trial ( A6 ) for each test length . This intertrial correlation was smallest for the shortest test ( . 46 for the 9 - item VL ) and larger for the longer tests ( . 80 for the 21 - item VL test and . 73 for the 24 - item VL test ) . Not surprisingly , the longer , ceiling - free tests are associated with greater intertrial correla - tions and greater reliability . Validity Test validity refers to the degree to which a test actually mea - sures what it claims to measure . If the test has high validity ( a matter of degree ) , the test scores reﬂect primarily the extent to which an individual possesses some trait or ability . Both the VPA and the VL tests are claimed to be tests of explicit episodic memory . Accordingly , performance on these two tests should be correlated . However , inspection of the magnitude of correlations between VPA and VL performance for the last study - test recall trial of List A ( VPA A3 and VL A5 ) and the short - delay recall trial ( VPA A4 and VL A6 ) revealed that low ceilings severely limit the extent to which a test correlates with other tests of the same or similar constructs , severely limiting test validity . The cor - relations between VPA A3 performance and VL A5 perfor - mance ( i . e . , recall on the last study - test trial ) for the six combinations of test length were as follows : (cid:1) . 11 , p > . 10 ( 8 / 24 ) ; . 33 , p < . 05 ( 12 / 21 ) ; . 29 , p 5 . 08 ( 16 / 18 ) ; . 42 , p < . 05 ( 20 / 15 ) ; . 13 , p > . 10 ( 24 / 12 ) ; and . 14 , p > . 10 ( 28 / 9 ) . Similarly , the correlations between VPA A4 performance and VL A6 per - formance ( i . e . , short - delay recall ) were (cid:1) . 01 , p > . 10 ( 8 / 24 ) ; . 36 , p < . 05 ( 12 / 21 ) ; . 46 , p < . 05 ( 16 / 18 ) ; . 37 , p < . 05 ( 20 / 15 ) ; . 33 , p 5 . 06 ( 24 / 12 ) ; and . 25 , p > . 10 ( 8 / 24 ) . These results demon - strate that the correlation between two putative tests of explicit episodic memory depends critically on test length , ranging from low and negative ( when one test is short ) to moderately high and positive ( when both tests are longer ) . Ignoring the ceiling effects , one might conclude that these two putative tests of explicit episodic memory do not measure the same thing . Intuition , prior research , and the present ﬁnd - ings , however , indicate that the VL and VPA tests actually do measure the same thing , episodic explicit memory , provided both tests are sufﬁciently long and do not impose artiﬁcial limits on performance that have nothing to do with examinees’ memory abilities . For example , correlations between 15 - item VPA and 15 - item VL tests ranged from . 38 to . 73 depending on age group in one study ( Uttl et al . , 2002 ) .

Volume 16—Number 6 465 Bob Uttl dition mean from the ceiling ( i . e . , the maximum score ) . The standardized distance was computed by subtracting the condi - tion mean from the maximum score and dividing the result by the standard deviation for that condition . For example , the standardized distance of the condition mean from the ceiling for Trial A1 of the 8 - item VPA test was 2 . 0 , calculated as ( 8 (cid:1) 3 . 4 ) / 2 . 3 . The solid curve in Figure 3 indicates the proportion of scores that would be equal to or larger than the maximum score if such scores were possible , if the score distribution was ap - proximately normal . The ﬁgure indicates that when the group mean is less than 1 standard deviation from the maximum score , at least 25 % of examinees achieve the maximum score , and performance is limited by severe ceiling effects ; when the mean is about 1 . 5 standard deviations from the maximum score , only about 10 % of examinees achieve the maximum score . CONCLUSIONS The ﬁndings demonstrate that normal healthy adults can re - member much more than what is suggested by widely used memory tests . Most people can remember many more than eight word pairs after three study - test trials and many more than 15 words after ﬁve study - test trials . Moreover , the results suggest that individual differences in memory abilities are much greater than what is suggested by these tests . The results conﬁrm that the most widely used memory tests— VPA and Word List tests of WMS – III , RAVLT , and CVLT—are afﬂicted by severe ceiling effects . The major consequences of these ceiling effects include ( a ) nonnormal distribution of test scores , ( b ) artiﬁcially lowered means , ( c ) artiﬁcially attenuated standard deviations , ( d ) attenuated reliability , and ( e ) attenu - ated validity . It is sometimes argued that these tests were designed to assess varying degrees of memory deficits in memory - impaired pa - tients and not intended as research tools for basic memory re - search , and that it is irrelevant that these tests are afﬂicted with severe ceiling effects when administered to normal healthy adults . However , this argument is easily refuted . First , the tests were normed using normal healthy adults . For example , WMS – III was normed using a nationally representative sample of 1 , 250 normal healthy adults from 16 to 89 years of age ( Wechsler , 1997 ) . Accordingly , if the norms—means , standard deviations , and distributions—are afﬂicted by ceiling effects , any inferences about the degree of memory deficits in memory - impaired individuals based on these norms will be incorrect , skewed by artiﬁcially lowered means and attenuated standard deviations . Second , the WMS – III Administration and Scoring Manual specifically advocates use of WMS – III ( including 8 - item VPA and 12 - item VL tests ) for research applications , as well as clinical evaluation . It states : ‘‘Specific research appli - cations of the WMS – III may include : effects of age - related changes on specific memory processes , effects of medication , . . . ’’ ( Wechsler , 1997 , p . 9 ) . Third , some researchers have ar - gued that the WMS – III norms are ‘‘the best data to examine’’ age - related changes in memory due to normal healthy aging ( e . g . , Salthouse , 2003 ) . And fourth , a survey of published re - search reveals that these tests are frequently used in basic research ( some examples are shown in Fig . 1 ) . Moreover , the ceiling effects observed in this study are not likely due to differences between college students and the na - tionally stratiﬁed normative samples whose data are reported in test manuals . First , similar ceiling effects are observed in test manuals . Second , the mean performance of college students in this study is comparable to the mean performance of normative samples ( e . g . , WMS – III norms ) for relevant test lengths . Third , similar ceiling effects were reported with community - dwelling samples ( e . g . , Graf & Uttl , 1995 ; Uttl et al . , 2002 ) . The ﬁndings demonstrate that tests afﬂicted by severe ceiling effects are not suitable for many of their original purposes because they cannot measure differences among individuals . Accordingly , tests with ceiling - afﬂicted norms should not be used to make decisions about individuals for the following reasons : ( a ) Participants are unable to demonstrate their memory abilities ; ( b ) participants with good memory cannot demonstrate anything but deﬁcient learning across trials ; ( c ) any mean - and standard - deviation - based criteria for classifying individuals as superior or deﬁcient are likely to be incorrect ; ( d ) normalization and standardization of raw - score data using ceiling - afﬂicted data are also likely wrong ; and ( e ) effects on decisions about individuals are difﬁcult to predict because ceiling effects affect both means and standard deviations . Similarly , research ﬁndings based on tests afﬂicted by ceiling effects may not be interpretable and may be misleading . In particular , ceiling effects may result in null ﬁndings , may lead to spurious interactions , may inﬂuence all correlation - and re - gression - based methods , may inﬂuence measures of proportion of variance explained , and may result in spuriously larger variability in lower - scoring groups , such as older adults , than in higher - scoring groups . Not surprisingly , meta - analyses con - ducted on such ceiling - limited data will be biased and may lead to incorrect conclusions . The results suggest that severe ceiling effects are present and inﬂuence performance scores for 25 % or more of the examinees whenever the group mean performance is within 1 standard deviation of the maximum score of the test . In contrast , when the standardized distance is equal to or more than 1 . 5 , performance is unlikely to be limited by severe ceiling effects , with fewer than 10 % of participants achieving the maximum score . ‘‘Knowledge is power , ’’ yet ‘‘ignorance is bliss . ’’ Proper measurement is the foundation of research and an absolute necessity for making informed clinical decisions about indi - viduals . Being aware is the ﬁrst step toward improving mea - surement tools and , therefore , working toward valid research inferences and accurate informed decisions about individuals . However , developing proper measurement tools requires ex - tensive research and pilot work . Will we become aware and be 466 Volume 16—Number 6 Ceiling Effects and Measurement of Individual Differences willing to put in such hard work ? Unfortunately , if recent re - search on the use of statistical power analyses ( Bezeau & Graves , 2001 ; Cohen , 1962 , 1994 ; Rossi , 1990 ) and use of conﬁdence intervals rather than on / off null - hypothesis testing in published research ( Fidler , Thomason , Cumming , Finch , & Leeman , 2004 ; Hunter , 1997 ; Loftus , 1996 ; Loftus & Masson , 1994 ) is any guideline , we are looking down a long , straight road of no change , and the future will yield more decisions about individuals , more research inferences , and more public state - ments based on ceiling effects and faulty measurement .
