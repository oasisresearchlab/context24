Insights into the Internalization and Retrograde Trafficking of Dengue 2 Virus in BHK - 21 Cells Nidhi Shrivastava . , Samatha Sripada . , Jasmine Kaur , Paresh S . Shah , D . Cecilia * National Institute of Virology , Pune , India Abstract Background : Dengue virus ( DENV ) enters cells via endocytosis , traffics to perinuclear ( PN ) region , the site of morphogenesis and exits by exocytosis . This study aims to understand the role of dynamin II , endosomes , microtubules ( MT ) and dynein in the early events of DENV replication . Findings : Using double immunoflourescence labelling of DENV - 2 infected BHK - 21 cells it was observed that the surface envelope ( E ) protein of the virion associated with dynamin II from 0 – 30 min post infection ( p . i . ) . The sphincter like array of dynamin II supported its pinchase - like activity . The association with endosomes was observed from 0 min at cell periphery to 30 min in the perinuclear ( PN ) region , suggesting that internalization continued for 30 min . Association of E protein with alpha - tubulin was observed from 8 h indicating that it was the newly translated protein that trafficked on the MT . Dynein was found to associate with the E protein from 4 h in the cytoplasm to 48 h in the PN region and dissociate at 72 h . Association of E protein with dynein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation . Overexpression of dynamitin , which disrupts the dynein complex , resulted in loss of trafficking of viral E and core proteins . The findings corroborated with the growth kinetics assessed by quantitation of viral RNA in infected BHK - 21 cells . The detection of E protein at 4 h – 8 h correlated with detectable increase in viral RNA from 8 h . The detection of high concentrations of E protein in the PN region at 24 – 48 h coincided with release of virus into the supernatant starting from 36 h p . i . The dissociation of dynein from E protein by 72 h was coincident with maximum release of virus , hinting at a possible negative feedback for viral protein translation . Conclusion : The study shows for the first time the association of dynamin II with DENV - 2 during entry and dynein dependent retrograde trafficking of DENV proteins on microtubules .

Introduction Dengue is by far the most devastating of all mosquito borne viral diseases , caused by dengue virus ( DENV ) , a member of the family Flaviviridae . More than 3 billion humans live in dengue endemic regions of the world and currently more than 50 million infections occur annually with at least 500 , 000 individuals requiring hospitalization [ 1 – 3 ] . Development of antiviral agents has so far focused on inhibiting viral enzymes , i . e . nonstructural protein 3 ( NS3 ) [ 4 ] . An understanding of virus morphogenesis and protein - protein interactions could provide new targets for intervention . DENV is an enveloped virus with a positive sense single - stranded , 11 kb RNA genome [ 5 ] . Infection begins with attachment of virus particles to host receptors , several of which have been identified as putative receptors i . e . heparan sulphate [ 6 ] , heat shock proteins , Hsp70 and Hsp 90 [ 7 ] , Glucose - regulated protein ( GRP78 / Bip ) [ 8 ] , a 37 - kDa / 67 - kDa high affinity laminin receptor [ 9 , 10 ] and Dendritic cell - specific intercellular adhesion molecule - 3 - Grabbing non - integrin ( DC - SIGN ) [ 11 ] . After binding to the receptor DENV undergoes either clathrin mediated endocytosis [ 12 ] , or directly enters into the cytoplasm of cells by fusion at the plasma membrane ( PM ) [ 13 , 14 ] . Following internalization , the virus envelope undergoes fusion with the endosomal membrane due to low pH , and the viral nucleocapsid is released into the host cytoplasm [ 15 , 16 ] . The viral RNA is then translated to yield structural and nonstructural viral proteins followed by transcrip - tion and replication of RNA , packaging and maturation in the perinuclear ( PN ) region [ 17 ] and egress by exocytosis [ 18 ] or budding at the PM [ 19 ] . The entire process of morphogenesis is dependent on the movement of virus and viral components within the cell . The cytoskeleton is an integral component for intra - cellular trafficking [ 20 , 21 ] with all 3 components , the microfila - ments , the microtubules ( MT ) and the intermediate filaments , involved [ 22 ] . Dynein , is a microtubule associated motor protein and is responsible for the movement of cargo from cell periphery to cell centre , from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to the Golgi [ 19 ] . A crucial role for dynein in the MT associated transport of viral proteins has been reported for hepatitis C [ 23 ] , African swine fever [ 24 ] , Hanta [ 25 ] , polio [ 26 ] and rabies [ 27 ] viruses . Although the major events in morphogenesis are broadly understood for DENV , the detailed events underlying , entry and retrograde trafficking have not been entirely delineated . The PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 October 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 10 | e25229 present study uses confocal microscopy to visualize internalization , endocytosis and early trafficking of DENV - 2 proteins and shows for the first time association of dynamin II with the envelope ( E ) protein during entry and relevance of dynein in the retrograde trafficking of envelope and core ( C ) proteins . Materials and Methods Cells and Virus BHK - 21 ( Baby Hamster Kidney ) ( C - 13 , American Type Culture Collection ) cells were used as the cell line was suitable for both infection as well as transfection studies . The cells were maintained in Minimal Essential Medium ( MEM ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 , supplemented with 200 U / ml of penicillin / streptomycin and 1 % glutamine . All cell culture reagents were procured from Gibco - BRL . DENV - 2 ( 803347 ) was obtained from the Institute’s Virus Repository and used in all the experiments . Antibodies and reagents For immunofluorescence assay primary antibodies included mouse monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) against DENV - 2 E glycopro - tein and C protein ( a kind gift from Dr . Askov , Queensland University of Technology , Australia ) , goat antibody against dynamin II , mouse MAb against dynein intermediate chain ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . , CA , USA ) , mouse MAb against alpha tubulin ( Sigma , USA ) . Secondary antibodies used were goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to FITC or donkey anti - mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 , donkey anti - goat IgG conjugated to Alexa 594 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) and rabbit anti - mouse IgG conjugated to TRITC ( Sigma ) . Lysotracker Red ( Molecular Probes ) was used to stain endosomes . Immunofluorescence Assay BHK - 21 cells were seeded one day prior to infection at a minimum concentration of 1 6 10 5 cells / ml per 55 mm petri dish ( Tarsons ) containing 9 6 22 mm cover slips . Cells were infected with DENV - 2 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 1 or 5 . Adsorption was carried out for 1 h at 4 u C to prevent virus entry and synchronize infection of cells . Cells were washed twice with cold medium to remove unbound virus and replenished with prewarmed medium . The cover slips were taken out of the culture at various time points post infection ( p . i . ) under sterile conditions , washed with 0 . 01 M phosphate buffer saline pH 7 . 2 ( PBS ) and fixed in ice - cold acetone for 10 min at 2 20 u C for experiments with dynein . Cells labeled for dynamin II and endosomes were fixed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temper - ature ( RT ) , followed by permeabilization with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 2 min and quenching with 0 . 01 M NH 4 Cl . The fixed cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS for 30 min . For dual staining , viral E or C proteins were labeled with specific mouse MAbs and the cellular components with the specific antibodies as mentioned in Table 1 . The primary antibodies to viral protein and cellular components were added simultaneously to the cells and incubated for 1 h followed by washing with PBS . This was followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes , FITC , TRITC , Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 ( Table 1 ) added simultaneously . DAPI ( 4 9 , 6 9 diamino - 2 - phenylindole ) was used to stain nucleus in all experiments . At the end of the staining process , cover slips were washed and mounted onto slides using mounting medium MOWIOL ( Calbiochem , CA , USA ) . Control cells , which were not infected but submitted to the same procedures , were included in all experiments as mock infected cultures . Transfection with GFP - dynamitin plasmid The GFP - dynamitin expressing plasmid was a kind gift from Dr . Beate Sodeik , Hannover Medical School , Germany . BHK - 21 cells , grown on coverslips in 6 well plates , were transfected with 2 ug GFP - dynamitin plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 Plus ( Invitrogen ) according to manufacturers instructions . Briefly , 2 ug of plasmid was diluted in 250 ul of MEM mixed with 250 ul of MEM containing 10 ul of Lipofectamine and incubated for 30 min at RT . The DNA - liposome complex was then added to preformed monolayer of BHK - 21 cells with 70 % confluency in serum free medium and incubated at 37 u C . Cells were then infected with DENV - 2 ( MOI of 1 ) at 6 h post transfection . The cells were fixed after 36 h p . i . and stained for DENV - 2 E or C protein using mouse anti - E or anti - C MAb followed by anti - mouse IgG labeled with TRITC . For comparison mock - transfected cells were infected with DENV - 2 and processed similarly . Image acquisition and image analysis The images were acquired using Laser Scanning Microscope 510 META ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) with 40 6 and 63 6 oil objective lens corrected for oil immersion . For dual color analysis , green and red emissions were recorded sequentially through appropriate filters ( 505 – 530 band - pass filters for Alexa 488 / FITC and 560 nm long - pass filters for Alexa 594 / TRITC ) . Post acquisition image analysis was done using the 3D projection option of LSM software , surface rendering option of Huygens Essential ( Scientific Volume Imaging , The Netherlands ) and maximum intensity projection using Imaris ( Bitplane Scientific software ) . Three - dimensional ( 3D ) images , which cover the entire depth of the cell , were derived from deconvolved images . All voxels ( volume pixels ) in the image with a given colocalization level were joined , forming a 3D surface . In the Table 1 .

Coimmunoprecipitation assay BHK - 21 cells were infected with DENV - 2 ( MOI of 1 ) . At 36 h p . i . , the cells were washed with ice cold PBS ( 0 . 01 M ) , scraped and centrifuged at 2000 rpm . The cells were lysed in 5 pellet volumes of ice - cold lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) NP40 , 0 . 1 mM NaF , 10 mM DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail ) . The clarified cell lysate containing approximately 500 ug of protein was incubated with 10 ul of equilibrated Sepharose protein A beads for one hour at 4 u C for preclearing and centrifuged to recover lysate . The precleared lysate was incubated overnight at 4 u C with human anti - DENV IgG ( purified from a serum sample that had plaque reduction neutralization titre of 12 , 500 ) for formation of immune complexes . The immune complexes were captured by Sepharose protein A beads by incubating for 3 h at 4 u C , centrifuged and washed three times with lysis buffer . The beads were resuspended in 30 ul of sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer ( 125 mM Tris , pH 6 . 8 , 4 % SDS , 20 % glycerol ) , boiled for 5 min , centrifuged and the supernatant was loaded on 12 . 5 % polyacrylamide gel under non reducing conditions . The proteins were transferred to nitrocellu - lose membrane for Western blot analysis . The blot was probed with anti - dynein antibody followed by goat anti - mouse IgG labeled with Horse radish peroxidase ( HRP ) ( Sigma ) and developed with diamino benzedene substrate . Mock infected BHK - 21 cell lysate pulled down with Sepharose protein A beads served as negative control . Infected BHK - 21 cells lysate was used as positive control . Real time PCR Viral RNA was quantitated in the infected cultures using a two step real time RT - PCR test reported previously [ 28 ] . BHK - 21 cells were infected at MOI of 1 and culture supernatant and cells were harvested at different time points starting from 0 h to 120 h p . i . Results Kinetics of DENV - 2 replication in BHK - 21 cells Prior to undertaking experiments on entry and early intracel - lular trafficking , the kinetics of viral RNA production in BHK - 21 cells was determined . BHK - 21 cells were infected with DENV - 2 at MOI of 1 ( , 10 9 RNA molecules ) and the cultures were assessed for cell - associated and cell free viral RNA at different time points p . i . by real time RT - PCR ( Fig . 1 ) . Despite washing off the unadsorbed virus , viral RNA ( 10 5 molecules ) was detected in cells as well as culture supernatant , from 0 – 6 h after infection . Similar levels of viral RNA at early time points after infection were shown in a previous report [ 29 ] . It is possible that virus particles , which are not internalized , remain loosely bound , and are detectable for a long time in culture . The inefficiency of the process of infection for flaviviruses with a PFU : particle ratio of 1 : 4000 has been reported before [ 30 , 31 ] . The cell - associated viral RNA levels showed a rise from 12 h onwards till 72 h ( 10 9 molecules ) and then decreased to 10 7 particles by 120 h . Viral RNA in the supernatant started increasing from 36 h and peaked at 84 h ( 10 7 molecules ) after which the level reached a plateau till 120 h . The cultures could not be tested after 120 h due to cell lysis . Association of dynamin II with DENV - 2 E protein Dynamin II , a MT associated GTPase protein is known to regulate clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 32 , 33 ] . The association of dynamin II with DENV - 2 E protein and the duration of the association were determined to understand the kinetics of internalization . BHK - 21 cells were infected with DENV - 2 at MOI of 5 to ensure infection of most cells simultaneously . Virus adsorption was carried out on ice to synchronize internalization [ 34 ] . After adsorption virus was removed and the monolayer was washed with cold medium . Immediately after adding pre - warmed medium , cells were fixed and processed for staining after 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes . Cells were double stained for DENV - 2 with mouse anti - E MAb and for dynamin II with goat anti - dynamin II antibody , followed by donkey anti - mouse IgG - Alexa Figure 1 . Growth curve of DENV - 2 in BHK - 21 cells . BHK - 21 cells were infected with DENV - 2 ( 803447 ) at 1 MOI and culture supernatants and cell lysates were collected at regular intervals from 0 – 120 h p . i . Viral RNA was quantitated by real time RT - PCR . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0025229 . g001 Internalization and Trafficking of DENV - 2 Virus PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 October 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 10 | e25229 488 and donkey anti - goat IgG - Alexa 594 . The E protein was presumed to represent the incoming virus , as it is the major surface protein on the virion [ 5 ] . Colocalization of E protein and dynamin II was observed from 0 min to 30 min p . i . The colocalization foci were counted and analyzed in 20 fields at 0 , 5 , 15 and 30 min time points ( Table 2 ) . The number of cells showing the presence of colocalization foci decreased from 50 % at 0 min to 17 % at 30 min . The size of the foci did not vary with time . The size of foci ranged from 0 . 75 um to 2 um , within which the spot of green fluorescence representing virus was 0 . 2 – 1 um ( size of virus 50 nm ) suggestive of each focus representing an aggregate of virus associating with dynamin II . In the area of colocalization the average fluorescence intensity for dyanmin II was 234 and did not change with time . The intensity of fluorescence for E protein decreased from 145 at 0 min to 84 at 15 min . The pattern of intensity reversed at points of no colocalization with average fluorescence intensity of 48 for dynamin II and 207 for E protein . The colocalization of E protein with dynamin II is depicted in the split image ( Fig . 2A ) . The intensity of DENV E protein at a point of no colocalization ( Fig . 2B ) is higher than that observed in the area of colocalization ( Fig . 2C ) as shown by the intensity profiles . For a clearer depiction of the merging of virus and dynamin II , deconvolved images of the cell in Fig . 2A were generated using Huygens surface rendering ( Fig . 2D ) wherein free virus can be seen ( green ) around the focus of colocalization ( yellow ) . To show that the complexes were present on the surface , z - stack images of the infected cells were acquired and analyzed by Maximum Intensity Projection ( Imaris ) ( Fig . 2E ) , which clearly shows the location of the aggregate on cell surface . Rotation of the image along its y - axis and 3D imaging using Zeiss software ( Fig . 2F ) further confirms the surface location of the complex . The colocalization between E protein and dynamin II decreased by 30 min p . i . ( Fig . 2G ) . At 60 min ( Fig . 2H ) there was no association between E protein and dynamin II . Fig . 2I shows the distribution of dynamin II in mock infected cells . The results illustrate the involvement of dynamin II in the process of virus internalization which peaked in the first 5 min of infection . Trafficking of virus within endosomes Lysotracker Red dye was used to follow the kinetics of DENV - 2 association within endosomes . Lysotracker red is an acidophilic dye which selectively stains low pH containing compartments and would therefore detect DENV - 2 in both early and late endosomes Cells were infected with DENV - 2 at 5 MOI , similar to the experiment with dynamin II and stained for E protein and endosomes at 0 min , 10 min , 15 min , 30 min , 1 h , 2 h , 4 h , and 8 h post infection . Lysotracker red was added to cells 2 h prior to fixation and cells were labeled for E protein using mouse anti - E MAb followed by goat anti - mouse IgG FITC after fixing . Tracking the movement of endosomes showed that the endosomes positive for E protein , were visible close to cell periphery at 0 min p . i . ( Fig . 3A ) , were present throughout the cytosol within 15 min and collected in the PN region by 30 min ( Fig . 3B ) . By 2 h ( Fig . 3C ) only a few cells showed association and by 4 h there was no colocalization ( Fig . 3D ) . The close association was further confirmed by the deconvolution analysis of the 30 min image ( Fig . 3E ) . The number of E - positive endosomes observed was higher than the number of dynamin II - E protein colocalization foci per cell , reflecting the transient nature of dynamin II - E protein complexes . The results indicate that DENV - 2 traffics within endosomes and is delivered to the PN region within 30 min . Infected cells were labeled for the presence of viral C protein at 1 h , 2 h and 4 h p . i . to detect capsid released within the cells . Absence of positive signal indicated that the concentration of released capsid was below detectable levels . The decrease in E protein - positive endosomes by 2 h indicates end of entry events . Association of DENV - 2 E protein with microtubule ( MT ) The microtubule network is the major highway along which there is movement of endocytosed material . Colocalization of the E protein with alpha tubulin was therefore examined in BHK - 21 cells infected at 1 MOI . Infected cells were fixed at different time points , 1 h , 2 h , 4 h , 8 h and 24 h p . i . The fixed cells were labeled first with mouse anti - E MAb followed by goat anti - mouse IgG FITC . The labeled cells were saturated with unlabeled goat anti - mouse IgG , then stained with mouse anti - alpha tubulin MAb followed by rabbit anti - mouse IgG TRITC . Close association between the two proteins was observed from 8 h ( Fig . 4A ) and maximized at 24 h ( Fig . 4B ) especially in the PN region , representative of the microtubule organization centre ( MTOC ) . Mock infected cells are shown in Fig . 4C . No colocalization was observed at early time points prior to 8 h p . i . Although confocal microscopy has its limitations , the observation of E protein associating with microtubules from 8 h onwards and not prior to that suggested that microtubules are intimately involved in trafficking of newly synthesized E protein and not the entering virions . Dynein dependent retrograde trafficking of DENV - 2 E protein Dynein is a minus - end directed motor protein complex , which is implicated in the trafficking of viral proteins towards the PN region [ 25 , 35 ] . DENV morphogenesis is known to occur in the PN region in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi apparatus [ 17 , 36 ] . To determine whether dynein was the motor protein involved in MT based trafficking of DENV - 2 E protein , infected cells were fixed and doubled stained for dynein intermediate chain and viral E protein at different time points from 2 h to 72 h p . i .

After reacting the cells with mouse anti - E MAb followed by rabbit anti - mouse IgG TRITC , the cells were blocked with unlabeled goat anti - mouse IgG . Cells were then incubated with mouse anti - dynein MAb followed by donkey anti - mouse IgG Alexa 488 . There was no E protein visible at 2 h ( not shown ) . Panel 5A shows the pattern of E - dynein association at 4 h , 12 h , 24 h , 36 h , 48 h , 60 h and 72 h with the intensity profiles for both fluorochromes in the marked region of colocalization . Dynein in uninfected cells was distributed evenly in the entire cell ( Fig . 5B ) . In the infected cell , intensity of dynein increased around the E protein . At 4 h , the E protein was present at very low concentration and colocalized with dynein . As time progressed , the concentration of E protein increased and by 12 h , a discrete bead like pattern of E - dynein complex , was seen which corresponded to the distribution of ER suggestive of trafficking to and from ER [ 37 ] . At 24 – 48 h maximum concentration of the dynein - E complex was observed in the PN region . Association of viral protein in the Golgi apparatus has been reported before [ 38 ] . At 60 h , colocalization was weak and by 72 h , dissociation between dynein and E protein was observed . Another facet of infection was revealed by the intensity profiles accompanying each split image . In infected cells the concentration of E protein and Figure 2 . DENV - 2 associates with dynamin II during internalization . BHK - 21 cells were infected at MOI of 5 . The cells were fixed at different time intervals and stained for DENV - 2 with mouse anti - E MAb and for dynamin II with goat anti - dynamin II antibody , followed by donkey anti - mouse IgG Alexa 488 and donkey anti - goat IgG Alexa 594 .

Deconvolved images were used to generate 3D reconstruction of E - dynein at 4 h ( Fig . 5C ) , 48 h ( Fig . 5D ) and 72 h ( Fig . 5E ) , which depicted the association followed by dissociation of dynein with E protein as infection progressed . The kinetics of association of dynein with E protein suggests that the newly synthesized E protein uses dynein for retrograde trafficking to the site of assembly and dissociates from it at 72 h when maximum virus is present in the cell supernatant ( Fig . 1 ) . Co - immunoprecipitation of dynein with DENV - 2 E protein Co - immunoprecipitation was used to prove that the colocaliza - tion between E protein and dynein observed by confocal microscopy represented formation of E - dynein complex . BHK - 21 cells were infected with DENV - 2 and lysed at 36 h p . i . , a time point at which maximum colocalization was observed . IgG , purified from the serum of a dengue immune individual was used to immunoprecipitate the proteins from infected and uninfected cell lysates . The immune complexes resolved by SDS - polyacryl - amide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) under non reducing condition followed by Western blot were identified with antibody directed against the intermediate chain of dynein ( Fig . 5F ) . The reactivity of anti - dynein antibodies with cell - associated dynein is shown in Lane 1 . The presence of dynein in the immune complex co - precipitated with human anti - dengue IgG coated sepharose A beads is visible in Lane 2 . There was no signal in the immunoprecipitated uninfected BHK - 21 lysate in Lane3 . The results of the co - immunoprecipitation assay validated the coloca - lization of E protein - dynein visible in infected cells by confocal microscopy . In silico docking of E protein with dynein The light chain of dynein ( LC8 ) bound to residues 128 – 138 of intermediate chain ( IC74 ) is reported to contain the cargo binding site [ 39 ] of the MT - dependent motor protein complex . Hex ( Version 5 . 1 ) , which is a molecular superimposition and docking program based on 8 Dimensional fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) , was used to carry out docking between the E protein of DENV - 2 and dynein using structures downloaded from the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) . DENV - 2 E monomer ( PDB : 1TG8 ) was docked with dynein ( PDB : 2P2T ) . The model with the lowest energy was selected for further analysis using Accelrys Discovery Studio visualizer ( version 2 . 5 ) . Five residues on the dynein molecule were found to interact with five residues on the E protein ( Fig . 6A , B ) . The five residues identified in the E protein ( Fig . 6C ) were conserved in 87 other strains of DENV - 2 ( protein sequences downloaded from Genbank ) when analyzed by Clustal W2 ( MEGA 5 . 03 ) . All five residues were located in domain I of the E protein but were discontinuous . Whether the residues are actually involved in binding will require further studies . Figure 3 .

Over expression of p50 / dynamitin , a subunit of dynactin acts as a dominant - negative inhibitor of dynein - dynactin interaction which blocks dynein mediated transport [ 40 , 41 ] . The effect of dynamitin over expression on DENV - 2 E protein trafficking was investigated . Cells were transfected with GFP - dynamitin and infected with DENV - 2 at 6 h post transfection . The infected cells were stained for E protein at 36 h p . i . , the time point at which maximum colocalization of E protein with dynein had been observed . In control nontransfected infected cultures , . 90 % of the cells were infected and positive for E protein which accumulated in the PN region ( Fig . 7A ) . In transfected infected cultures GFP - dynamitin positive cells showed low expression of E protein in the cytosol and not in the PN region as seen in adjacent dynamitin - negative cells ( Fig . 7B ) . Therefore there was inhibition of expression of E protein and its trafficking to the PN region . The effect of over - expression of dynamitin on the transport of C protein was also investigated . DENV C protein is known to contain nuclear localization signals , and is transported to the nucleus [ 42 ] . In the infected mock transfected cells C protein was observed in the cytosol and in the nucleus ( Fig . 7C ) . In comparison in GFP - dynamitin transfected infected cells , the C protein was expressed but restricted to the cytosol ( Fig . 7D ) . Cells showing high intensity of GFP - dynamitin ( white arrowhead ) had no detectable C protein . A similar pattern was also seen for the E protein ( not shown ) . The results thus unequivocally proved the role of dynein in trafficking of DENV - 2 E and C proteins . Discussion The current study was undertaken to determine the interactions of cellular proteins with E protein during the internalization and trafficking of DENV - 2 in mammalian fibroblast cells ( BHK - 21 ) using confocal microscopy . DENV has been shown to gain entry into different cell types using different modes of internalisation , i . e . clathrin / caveolae dependent endocytosis [ 12 ] and fusion at PM [ 14 ] . We studied the dynamin II dependency of virus entry . Dynamin II belongs to a family of GTPases associated with formation of nascent vesicles and promotion of vesicle fission [ 43 ] and is closely associated with clathrin - mediated endocytosis . We were successful in showing a strong association between DENV - 2 E protein and dynamin II using confocal microscopy . The E protein is the major surface glycoprotein of DENV , which is responsible for engaging the receptor [ 44 , 45 ] . Therefore visual - Figure 6 . Docking of DENV - 2 E protein with dynein .

We used the E - dynamin II association to determine the kinetics of DENV - 2 entry . Colocaliza - tion of DENV - 2 E protein with dynamin II within seconds was in concordance with the function of dynamin II , which during clathrin mediated endocytosis aggregates around the vesicle and serves as pinchase - like mechanoenzyme to facilitate the formation of endocytic vesicles by severing nascent endocytic pits from the PM [ 46 ] . The higher intensity of dynamin II at the foci of colocalization was perhaps a reflection of dynamin II aggregation at the site of endocytosis [ 47 ] . The observation of lower intensity of E protein in the foci of colocalization compared to the points of no colocalization could be due to lower accessibility of the E protein to the antibody once the virus had entered the process of endocytosis . The presence of large amounts free virions on the cell surface was supported by the detection of substantial viral RNA at 0 – 6 h p . i . by real time RT - PCR . This kind of visualization of the endocytosis process is being shown for the first time . The maximum internalization occurs within the first 15 min of infection , however the E - dynamin II complex could be visualized at the cell surface till 30 min . This indicates that DENV - 2 internalization is a process that goes on till 30 min p . i . The kinetics with confocal microscopy was in agreement with the internalization kinetics reported earlier by electron microscopy [ 6 ] and estimation of internalized infectious virus by PFU assay [ 48 ] , where maximum internalization of virus occurs within the first few minutes of infection . Labelling for endosomes and E protein revealed that DENV - 2 localised in endosomes within 0 min p . i . and by 30 min the E protein positive endosomes were observed mostly in the PN region . Therefore internalization and the process of virus trafficking to the PN region via endosomes continue for 30 min . Association of dengue virus with early and late endosomes has been shown at 3 min and 17 min post infection respectively by live cell imaging [ 49 , 50 ] . The absence of endosome free E protein in the cytoplasm during this period indicated that virus travels to the site of replication protected in the endocytic vesicles and uncoating occurs directly at the site of replication . Following endocytosis the low pH of the endosomes results in trimerization of the envelope protein [ 51 , 52 ] followed by fusion and uncoating of nucleocapsid . It has been reported for other flaviviruses that most of the steps in replication occur in the PN region [ 53 ] . Intracellular shuttling of both proteins and vesicles requires cytoskeletal filaments and molecular motor proteins [ 54 , 55 ] . Staining for MT and DENV - 2 E protein showed close association between the two from 8 h onwards , with viral protein accumulating in the PN region . Cytoplasmic dynein transports cargo toward the microtubule minus end . Co staining with dynein revealed colocalization of DENV - 2 E protein with dynein from 4 h p . i . Before this time point the E protein could not be seen either in association with dynein or independent . The last sighting of E protein was at 2 h within endosomes . Transcription of viral RNA has been reported to occur by 2 h [ 49 ] . It follows therefore that uncoating and the first round of translation of genomic RNA should be occurring before 2 h . The fact that the E protein could not be observed in the cells till 4 h indicated that the concentration of the initially translated protein is too low to be detected by immunofluorescence assay . Therefore the E protein was seen colocalized with dynein only after the de novo synthesis of viral proteins had reached a substantial concentration . By 12 h most of the dynein was engaged by the viral E protein . The E - dynein complex aggregated to the PN region by 36 h , which is now known to be the region of high viral activity [ 17 , 53 ] . Further proof of binding of E protein to dynein was provided by co - immunoprecipitation at 36 h post infection and also by protein - protein docking analysis . A putative site of interaction comprising of five residues was identified on the E protein . Three of the five residues are present in the recognition sequence on dynein - binding cargo proteins . Dynein mediated transport of the E protein on the microtubules is perhaps involved in the movement of E protein to the ER and from the ER to the Golgi apparatus , the major players in DENV morphogenesis [ 5 ] . The loss of association by 60 – 72 h was co - incidental with maximum release of virus into the supernatant of infected cultures as proved by real time RT - PCR data . Loss of association with dynein indirectly suggests reduction in synthesis of E protein . Therefore , it is possible that when there is peak virus production , there is shutdown of viral protein synthesis . To prove that dynein mediated trafficking was essential for DENV - 2 replication , dynein motor activity was disrupted by over expression of dynamitin and its effect was seen on the expression of viral E protein . Dynamitin , a subunit of dynein dynactin complex , is required for cargo transport [ 41 ] . Over expression of dynamitin resulted in lower concentrations of viral E and C proteins and inhibited their translocation to target sites . Higher expression of dynamitin resulted in total inhibition of E and C protein expression , which was indicative of inhibition of virus replication . Thus dynein was crucial to the trafficking of newly synthesized DENV structural proteins , E and C . In conclusion the virions gain entry via dynamin II assisted endocytosis . They are translocated from cell periphery to PN region within endosomes . The newly translated DENV - 2 protein binds to dynein and traffics on MT to PN region which is known to be the site of assembly . The association of dynein in the intracellular transport of DENV - 2 proteins is being shown for the first time . Acknowledgments We thank Dr . K .
