Fish and 22 amphibia have one IL1 gene , while mammals have two copies of IL1 , IL1A and IL1B , 23 with distinct expression patterns and differences in their proteolytic activation . Our 24 current understanding of the evolutionary history of IL - 1 is mainly based on 25 phylogenetic analyses , but this approach provides no information on potentially 26 different functions of IL - 1 homologs , and it remains unclear which biological activities 27 identified for IL - 1α and IL - 1β in mammals are present in lower vertebrates . Here , we 28 use in vitro and in vivo experimental models to examine the expression patterns and 29 cleavage of IL - 1 proteins from various species . We found that IL - 1 in the teleost 30 medaka shares the transcriptional patterns of mammalian IL - 1α , and its processing 31 also resembles that of mammalian IL - 1α , which is sensitive to cysteine protease 32 inhibitors specific for the calpain and cathepsin families . By contrast , IL - 1 proteins in 33 reptiles also include biological properties of IL - 1β . Therefore , we propose that 34 duplication of the ancestral IL1 gene led to segregation of expression patterns and 35 protein processing that characterizes the two extant forms of IL - 1 in mammals . 36 3 1 . Introduction 37 The interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) family of cytokines orchestrates the immune response by 38 mediating intercellular communication between many different cell types . Activated IL - 39 1 has a range of inflammatory effects from fever induction to hematopoiesis and 40 antibody synthesis ( summarized in Dinarello , 2009 ) . Like other immune - related 41 cytokine genes , IL1 genes are fast - evolving , driven by the need of the immune system 42 to adapt to constantly changing threats . They have been identified in cartilaginous fish 43 and all other jawed vertebrates ( Bird et al . , 2002 ; Rivers - Auty et al . , 2018 ) . Only one 44 IL1 gene is found in the genomes of most anamniotes ( fishes and amphibians ) , 45 although some teleost species such as rainbow trout ( Heston , 1982 ) and carp 46 ( Engelsma et al . , 2003 ) have two copies , most likely due to species - specific gene 47 duplication events . The presence of IL1A and IL1B genes in all mammals and their 48 localization on the same chromosome suggest that a tandem gene duplication event 49 has occurred in their common ancestor ( Eisenberg et al . , 1991 ; Young and Sylvester , 50 1989 ) . 51 The biological activities of IL - 1α and IL - 1β have been extensively analyzed in mice and 52 humans . The two cytokines share a common transduction pathway but differ in their 53 expression patterns and activation processes ( Di Paolo and Shayakhmetov , 2016 ) . At 54 the transcriptional level , IL1A is constitutively expressed in a variety of cell types of 55 hematopoietic and non - hematopoietic origin , such as keratinocytes , endothelial cells 56 and the mucosal epithelium ( Netea et al . , 2015 ; Rider et al . , 2017 ) , whereas IL1B 57 expression is predominantly induced in hematopoietic cells in response to 58 inflammation ( Dinarello , 2009 ) . IL1B is also strongly expressed in various cancer cell 59 types ( Rébé and Ghiringhelli , 2020 ) . The IL - 1α protein is biologically active both in its 60 full - length and cleaved forms , while the IL - 1β full - length protein needs to be 61 enzymatically cleaved to become active . The processing of the two IL - 1 paralogs is 62 regulated by distinct mechanisms . Both IL - 1α and IL - 1β can be processed by multiple 63 proteases ( Afonina et al . , 2015 ) . However , IL - 1β is processed most efficiently by 64 Caspase - 1 ( Thornberry et al . , 1992 ) , which , after its activation by the inflammasome 65 ( Martinon et al . , 2002 ) , cleaves IL - 1β at two distinct sites ( Howard et al . , 1991 ) . 66 Caspase 1 - mediated processing also results in the most bioactive form of IL - 1β 67 ( Afonina et al . , 2015 ) . By contrast , Caspase - 1 cannot process the IL - 1α protein 68 ( Howard et al . , 1991 ) , which can instead be cleaved by Calpain proteases ( Carruth et 69 4 al . , 1991 ; Kobayashi et al . , 1990 ) and Granzyme B ( Afonina et al . , 2011 ) . To what 70 extent the biological activities of mammalian IL - 1α and IL - 1β are conserved in 71 anamniotes is not known . 72 Thus far , the single IL1 gene found in the genomes of lower vertebrates has been 73 interpreted as being most closely related to mammalian IL1B and is therefore seen as 74 a functional homolog . This assumption is mainly based on phylogenetic analyses 75 ( Ogryzko et al . , 2014a ; Rivers - Auty et al . , 2018 ) . However , the overall low conservation 76 of IL - 1 proteins between species justifies a reassessment of this interpretation and the 77 consideration of other characteristic factors , such as gene expression patterns and 78 protein processing mechanisms , to support a definite assignment . Here , we compare 79 characteristics other than peptide sequences between IL - 1 proteins of anamniotes and 80 mouse IL - 1α and IL - 1β . We have created a reporter for in vivo visualization of the 81 expression patterns and processing of IL - 1 in transgenic medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) and 82 tested in vitro the dependence of cleavage of IL - 1 proteins from various anamniote 83 species on Caspase - 1 . Our results show that the medaka ortholog is expressed and 84 processed in a manner similar to mammalian IL - 1α and that a conserved Caspase - 1 85 cleavage site is already present in amniotes . 86 2 . Results and Discussion 87 2 . 1 . Evolution of IL - 1 in vertebrates 88 Comparing nucleotide or amino acid sequences between species is a common method 89 to elucidate evolutionary relationships . However , comparison of fast evolving genes 90 across longer evolutionary times can be difficult , especially if pressures to diversify are 91 active . In a phylogenetic tree of IL - 1 proteins from lower and higher vertebrates , teleost 92 IL - 1 proteins form a separate cluster and share a branch point with clusters for 93 mammalian IL - 1α and IL - 1β ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that the amino acid sequences of 94 IL - 1α and IL - 1β are equally distant from teleost IL - 1 , mostly consistent with what has 95 been shown by other studies ( Bird et al . ; Gibson et al . , 2014 ; Ogryzko et al . , 2014a ; 96 Rivers - Auty et al . , 2018 ) . This is also true for avian and amphibian IL - 1 proteins , which 97 together form a separate cluster . Therefore , an accurate assignment of IL - 1 proteins 98 in lower vertebrates as homologs to either IL - 1α or IL - 1β on the basis of phylogenetic 99 analysis is not possible . Another criterion that can help assign ancestral relationships 100 of genes is the comparison of their genomic localization , i . e . , synteny of neighboring 101 5 genes across longer genomic stretches . The regions of vertebrate genomes in which 102 the IL1 genes are located are overall highly conserved , but this provides no helpful 103 information because mammalian IL - 1α and IL - 1β are located next to each other within 104 the same synteny group due to a tandem duplication event ( Rivers - Auty et al . , 2018 ) . 105 We therefore examined the conservation of characteristic amino acid sequences for 106 IL - 1α or IL - 1β proteins that are relevant for their proteolytic processing . Alignment of 107 IL - 1 proteins from mammals , amphibians , reptiles , birds , teleosts , and cartilaginous 108 fishes showed that known cleavage sites in mammalian IL - 1α and IL - 1β are poorly 109 conserved in lower vertebrates ( Figure 1B ) . Although all IL - 1 proteins have the same 110 structure in which the N - and the C - terminal domains are separated by a linker that 111 contains potential cleavage sites ( Figure 1C ) , many lower vertebrates lack the 112 conserved aspartic acid residue as a Caspase - 1 cleavage sites in this linker as well as 113 the conserved beta trefoil fold that is characteristic for mammalian IL - 1β ( Figure 1B ) . 114 The aspartic acid residue that at which the mammalian IL - 1β N - terminus is cleaved is 115 evolutionarily first present in the reptilian IL - 1 protein ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . 116 Previous studies showed that the zebrafish IL - 1 protein can be cleaved by Caspase A 117 and Caspase B in transfected HEK cells ( Li et al . , 2018 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Vojtech et al . , 118 2012 ) . However , only one of the three aspartic acid residues identified as potential 119 substrates of Caspase - 1 homologues ( Caspa and Caspb ) in zebrafish IL - 1 ( Ogryzko 120 et al . , 2014a ; Vojtech et al . , 2012 ) can be cleaved by Caspase - 1 in the sea bass ( Reis 121 et al . , 2012 ) . This aspartic acid residue in zebrafish IL - 1 can be found in avian IL - 1 but 122 not in mammalian IL - 1β . Besides the Caspase - 1 site , the potential cleavage sites for 123 other proteases such as Calpains , Cathepsins or Elastase are poorly conserved in IL - 124 1 homologs ( Figure 1B ) . Therefore , protein alignments are not sufficient to assign IL - 125 1 genes in lower vertebrates as direct ancestors of either IL - 1α or IL - 1β in mammals 126 or even to deduce the function of an IL - 1 common ancestor . Also , to what extent the 127 biological activity of IL - 1 proteins in anamniotes depends on their processing is still 128 unknown . 129 2 . 2 . Expression of medaka il1 in naïve and upon infection or local injury 130 To better understand the evolutionary history of IL - 1 , we performed a comprehensive 131 comparative analysis . One aspect that distinguishes mammalian IL1A and IL1B is their 132 distinct expression profiles . IL1A is constitutively expressed at high level in various cell 133 types , including epithelial and hematopoietic cells , while IL1B expression is weak but 134 6 strongly inducible in monocytic cells in response to inflammation ( Dinarello , 2009 ; 135 Hadadi et al . , 2016 ) . To determine the expression activity of the il1 gene in lower 136 vertebrates , we use medaka as a model . We performed whole - mount in situ 137 hybridization ( WISH ) with a probe for the il1 full - length transcript but could not detect 138 expression in naïve embryos . However , in embryos injected with E . coli , il1 was 139 strongly expressed around the site of injection ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) , which is 140 consistent with previous observations in zebrafish ( Ogryzko et al . , 2014b ) . Because it 141 was not clear whether absence of il1 staining in naïve embryos is due to insufficient 142 sensitivity of the WISH , we created an il1 transgenic reporter fish , in which a 6 . 9 kb 143 long il1 promoter drives the transcription of a t2a - based bi - cistronic mRNA ( Szymczak 144 et al . , 2004 ) encoding GFP and medaka full - length il - 1 tagged with a hemagglutinin 145 ( HA ) peptide at the C - terminus ( Figure 2A ) . This reporter allowed us not only to reveal 146 the spatial expression patterns of il1 gene but also to assess the processing of the IL - 147 1 protein under various conditions using the HA - specific antibody . The GFP signal was 148 detectable as a weak fluorescence signal in the epidermis of live embryos one day 149 post - fertilization ( dpf ) ( Figure 2B ) . At later stages , the GFP signal became restricted to 150 the epithelial compartment of the skin , gills , and thymus as well as the neuromasts of 151 the lateral line ( Figure 2C ) . Similar to our observation , zebrafish il1 is expressed in the 152 skin , gills , and thymus ( Hasegawa et al . , 2017 ; Nguyen - Chi et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , 153 human IL1A is expressed in keratinocytes and thymic epithelial cells ( Dalloul et al . , 154 1991 ) . These findings suggest that il1 expression in the epithelial compartment , which 155 is characteristic for mammalian IL1A , is conserved among vertebrates . 156 We also analyzed the il1 expression in the adult hematopoietic cells and performed 157 flow cytometry of isolated cells from blood , kidney , and spleen ( Figure 2D ) . As negative 158 control , blood of non - transgenic fish was used . Eight percent of blood cells , 57 . 8 % of 159 kidney cells , and 40 . 7 % of spleen cells were GFP - positive . The constitutive expression 160 of medaka il1 in hematopoietic cells is consistent with zebrafish il1 ( Hasegawa et al . , 161 2017 ; Nguyen - Chi et al . , 2014 ) and mouse IL1a ( Takacs et al . , 1988 ) . This result 162 further supports the notion that regulatory elements controlling the constitutive 163 expression of IL1A are also conserved in lower vertebrates . 164 Besides their constitutive expression , il1 genes in lower vertebrates are inducible by 165 inflammatory stimuli ( Hasegawa et al . , 2017 ; Nguyen - Chi et al . , 2014 ) . Our WISH 166 analysis ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) further confirms this observation . To distinguish 167 whether il1 inducibility is restricted to epithelial compartments or hematopoietic cells , 168 7 we performed local injury and subcutaneous injection of bacteria in the transgenic fish . 169 The GFP signal increased substantially in the epidermis when 50 µM 170 Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) was injected into the muscle tissue ( Figure 3A ) or when the 171 tail fins of transgenic larvae were injured ( Figure 3B , C ) indicating that il1 expression 172 can be induced in non - hematopoietic cells . Next , we subcutaneously injected bacterial 173 debris conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 into adult transgenic fish and analyzed 174 hematopoietic cells , isolated from blood , kidney , and spleen using flow cytometry 16 175 hours - post - injection . We identified cells that expressed il1 and had engulfed 176 bioparticles by their combined red and green fluorescence ( 6 . 5 % , 47 . 7 % and 39 . 1 % 177 GFP + / RFP + cells in blood , kidney , and spleen , respectively ; data from two independent 178 experiments ) . The presence of GFP + / RFP + cells in the spleen ( Figure 3D ) indicated 179 that that all myeloid cells that had engulfed bioparticles also expressed the il1 gene . 180 Whether il1 expression was induced in them locally and they then migrated into the 181 spleen , as a secondary lymphoid organ , to initiate the adaptive immune response 182 cannot be deduced from this data . Taken together , our results reveal that il1 is 183 constitutively expressed in various epithelial tissues and can be upregulated in 184 keratinocytes and myeloid cells upon infection or local injury . Therefore , the expression 185 pattern of medaka il1 resembles that of mammalian IL1A which is both constitutive 186 and inducible ( Chan et al . , 2017 ; Luan et al . , 2017 ; Suzuki et al . , 2000 ) . 187 2 . 3 . Processing of medaka IL - 1 by proteases in vivo 188 To investigate the processing of medaka IL - 1 in response to inflammatory stimuli , we 189 used an anti - HA antibody to detect the transgenic , C - terminally tagged IL - 1 in whole 190 fish lysates on Western blots ( WB ) . To prime immune cells , freshly hatched transgenic 191 larvae were first exposed to LPS for 150 minutes ( Figure 4 ) . In a second treatment , we 192 added either nigericin or ionomycin for an additional 45 minutes before lysates from 193 whole larvae were prepared . Nigericin acts as a potassium ionophore that activates 194 the NLRP3 inflammasome ( Mariathasan et al . , 2006 ) , which is required for the 195 Caspase - 1 - dependent cleavage and secretion of mammalian IL - 1β ( reviewed in : 196 Franchi et al . , 2009 ) . By contrast , ionomycin is a membrane permeable calcium 197 ionophore that increases intracellular calcium levels triggering Calpain activation and 198 mature IL - 1α release ( Groβ et al . , 2012 ; Tapia et al . , 2019 ) . Untreated larvae were 199 used as a control group . The IL - 1 pro - peptide is estimated to be around 29 kDA , and 200 the C - terminal cleavage products are expected to be between 16 . 8 and 19 . 8 kDa if the 201 8 precursor is cleaved within the linker region between the N - and C - terminal domains 202 ( the predicted products are schematically depicted in Figure 4B ) . Western blot analysis 203 showed several bands for IL - 1 ( Figure 4C ) . In the control group , we detected HA - 204 positive proteins around 29 and 58 kDa . The latter product is probably a read - through 205 of the GFP - T2A - Il1 open reading frame that occurs when T2A - induced cleavage is not 206 efficient ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . An additional protein fragment with a size around 20 kDa 207 was detected when larvae were treated with 20 mM ionomycin ( Figure 4C ) . This 208 peptide was not detected upon treatment with LPS alone or LPS with the potassium 209 ionophore nigericin , a commonly used inflammasome activator . 210 The 20 kDa IL - 1 protein was still present when larvae were treated with the Caspase - 211 1 inhibitor Ac - YVAD - cmk . By contrast , when larvae were treated with cysteine protease 212 inhibitors MDL - 28170 and CA - 074 prior to and during ionomycin treatment , the 20 kDa 213 protein was not detectable . Given that MDL - 28170 and CA - 074 inhibit Calpains and 214 proteases of the Cathepsin family ( Mehdi , 1991 ; Montaser et al . , 2002 ) , our result 215 indicates that medaka IL - 1 can be processed by cysteine proteases from one or both 216 of these protein families . 217 We also assessed the spatial expression patterns of calpains and their small subunit 218 capns1 as well as cathepsin B , L and S in medaka embryos . WISH analysis showed 219 that calpain2 , capns1b and c athepsin L2 and S are all expressed in the skin and gut , 220 with enhanced expression in neuromasts ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Their 221 colocalization with il1 expression makes them potential candidates for IL - 1 processing 222 enzymes in medaka . 223 2 . 4 . Processing of medaka IL - 1 in vitro 224 To further test our conclusion that medaka IL - 1 is processed in a similar manner as 225 mammalian IL - 1α , we compared the processing of medaka IL - 1 and mouse IL - 1α and 226 IL - 1β in a cell - based assay using the pro - interleukin - 1b - Gaussia luciferase ( iGLuc ) 227 fusion assay ( Bartok et al . , 2013 ) . In this assay , pro - IL - 1 - dependent formation of 228 protein aggregates renders the Gaussia luciferase ( GLuc ) inactive , and this can be 229 reversed if the cytokine is cleaved , leading to recovery of luciferase activity ( Figure 230 5A ) . We transfected mouse J774 macrophages with constructs containing full - length 231 cDNAs of medaka il1 , mouse IL1a or mouse IL1b fused with the Gluc reporter . 232 Transfected macrophages were then treated in a similar protocol as in the in vivo 233 experiments ( Figure 4A ) . In vitro , LPS alone was not sufficient to induce luciferase 234 9 activity in macrophages transfected with any of the three IL - 1 constructs . However , 235 luciferase became activated when transfected cells were treated with nigericin or 236 ionomycin . Consistent with our previous study ( Bartok et al . , 2013 ) , luciferase was 237 activated up to 50 - fold when cells transfected with mouse IL1b - Gluc were treated with 238 nigericin ( Figure 5B ) , but not with ionomycin . The effect of nigericin on cleavage of 239 mouse IL - 1α and medaka IL - 1 was lower . Conversely , ionomycin treatment resulted in 240 a strong luciferase activity in cells transfected with mouse IL - 1α - Gluc or medaka IL - 1 - 241 Gluc constructs ( Figure 5B ) . 242 Mouse IL - 1α has been reported to be cleaved by cysteine proteases . To determine 243 whether this is also true of medaka IL - 1 , we additionally applied the cysteine protease 244 inhibitor MDL - 28170 along with LPS and ionomycin . Here , we found a dosage - 245 dependent decrease of luciferase activity for constructs carrying medaka IL - 1 or mouse 246 IL - 1α ( Figure 5C ) , suggesting that the cleavage of medaka IL - 1 also depends on 247 cysteine proteases and further confirming our in vivo observations . To test whether 248 Caspase - 1 can cleave medaka IL - 1 , we co - transfected 293T cells with plasmids 249 carrying either medaka or human Caspase - 1 . We found that human Caspase - 1 was 250 only able to cleave mouse IL - 1β but not mouse IL - 1α or medaka IL - 1 ( Figure 5D ) . 251 Medaka Caspase - 1 was not able to cleave any of the tested IL - 1 proteins . Together , 252 these results indicate that medaka IL - 1 and mouse IL - 1α can be processed by cysteine 253 proteases of the calpain or cathepsin family . 254 2 . 5 . Caspase - 1 mediated IL - 1 cleavage in vertebrates 255 The processing of IL - 1β by Caspase - 1 seen in mammals does not appear to occur in 256 medaka IL - 1 . However , zebrafish IL - 1 can be processed by zebrafish Caspase A ( also 257 named Casp1 ) and Caspase B ( also named Casp19a ) in transfected HEK cells ( Li et 258 al . , 2018 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Vojtech et al . , 2012 ) and primary zebrafish leukocytes ( Vojtech 259 et al . , 2012 ) . It is worth nothing that the zebrafish inflammatory Caspases ( Caspase A , 260 Caspase b , Caspase 19b and Caspase 23 ) differ from mammalian Caspase - 1 and the 261 Caspase - 1 found in other teleost species : while the latter have a Caspase recruitment 262 domain ( CARD ) at their N - terminus , zebrafish Caspases A , B and 19b have a Pyrin 263 ( PYD ) domain instead . Moreover , the mutually dependent activity of Caspase A and B 264 necessary for cleavage of zebrafish IL - 1 is not conserved in other vertebrates , and the 265 aspartic acid residues identified by ( Vojtech et al . , 2012 ) as Caspase - A and Caspase - 266 B - specific cleavage sites are not conserved Caspase - 1 cleavage sites in mammals . 267 10 Therefore , it is likely that zebrafish has independently acquired the ability to be cleaved 268 by caspases . The alignment of IL - 1 proteins in vertebrates shows that the N - terminal 269 mammalian IL - 1β Caspase - 1 cleavage site is conserved in amniotes ( Figure 6A ) . To 270 determine whether Caspase - 1 - mediated IL - 1 cleavage is characteristic for amniotes , 271 we tested IL - 1 proteins from different amniotes ( reptiles : alligator and turtle ) and 272 anamniotes ( fish : shark ; amphibian : Xenopus ) . By co - transfecting IL - 1 constructs with 273 human Caspase - 1 , we found that both turtle and alligator IL - 1 are cleaved at a site 274 close to the N - terminus , estimated by the product size of around 30 kDa , similar to the 275 intermediate cleavage product of mouse IL - 1β ( Figure 6B ) . By contrast , IL - 1 of 276 Xenopus and shark could not be cleaved by human Caspase - 1 . Taken together we 277 show that , first , the expression patterns and protein cleavage of IL - 1 in medaka 278 resemble the mammalian IL - 1α and , secondly , the cleavage of IL - 1 by Caspase - 1 279 observed has evolved in amniotes . Therefore , a designation of IL - 1 in anamniotes as 280 homologue of IL - 1β is currently not justified . Additional experimental models will be 281 needed to elucidate the extent to which the cleavage of IL - 1 proteins by calpains in 282 anamniotes is necessary for their activity . 283 3 . Material and Methods 284 3 . 1 . Bioinformatic analysis 285 Sequences were retrieved using BLASTP searches ( http : / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / or 286 ensemble . org ) with default parameters using human and mouse IL - 1 proteins . In our 287 phylogenetic tree analysis , we included IL - 1 protein sequences from nine mammals , two 288 reptiles , four birds , eight teleosts and one cartilaginous fish . All genes are listed in 289 Supplementary Table 1 . Sequence alignment and phylogenetic trees were done with the 290 Geneious ( version 3 ) software . 291 3 . 2 . Fish 292 Adult medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) were kept under a 14 h light – 10 h dark cycle at 26°C . 293 Embryos were collected and kept in embryonic rearing medium ( ERM ) . Freshly hatched yolk - 294 sac transgenic larvae were used for most of three experiments . Generation of medaka 295 transgenic reporter lines , and all experimental protocols were performed in accordance with 296 relevant institutional and national guidelines and regulations and were approved by the EMBL 297 Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC nos . 2019 - 03 - 19ML ) . 298 3 . 3 . Generation of transgenic fish 299 11 To generate transgenic il1 : gfp - t2a - il1 - HA reporter fish , a fragment containing GFP and full - 300 length of medaka il1 cDNA separated by t2a , a short viral sequences , were cloned into a vector 301 containing 6 . 9 kb upstream region of the il1 gene ( Figure 2A ) . The plasmid at 10 - 25 ng / µl 302 concentration together with 1 µl I - SceI meganuclease and NEB buffer ( NewEngland BioLabs ) 303 were co - injected into the blastomere at one - cell stage embryos . F0 larvae with GFP signal 304 were selected for breeding . 305 3 . 4 . Immunohistochemistry 306 Larvae were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in 0 . 1 % Tween PBS ( 1xPTW ) . After three 307 washes , larvae were incubated in 30 % sucrose / PTW for 24 hrs followed by 50 % tissue 308 freezing medium / 30 % Sucrose / PTW for another day . Samples were mounted and 309 sectioned at 20 µM on a cryostat ( Leica Biosystems CM2050S ) . Sections were rehydrated for 310 20 min with 1x PTW and blocked with 10 % NGS / PTW for 2 hrs . They were incubated 311 with 1 : 500 mouse - anti - GFP ( Sigma ) and 1 : 500 Rb - anti - HA antibody ( Cell signaling ) in 1 % 312 NGS / PTW over night at 4°C . After several washing steps in PTW , sections were stained 313 with anti - Rabbit - Alexa 647 and anti - mouse - Alexa488 in 1 % NGS / PTW with 1 : 1000 diluted 314 DAPI for 2 hrs at 37°C . Slides were washed 3x 10 min with PTW and then mounted with Vectra 315 shield ( Vectra labs ) . A Zeiss 780 confocal microscope with a 40x water objective was used for 316 imaging of stained sections . 317 3 . 5 . Flow cytometry 318 Cells were isolated from spleen , kidney , and blood from adult transgenic fish . To avoid blood 319 coagulation , ice cold 0 . 57x PBS with 30 mM EDTA was used to collect blood from fish . Cells 320 were disaggregated using a cell strainer ( 40 µm Nylon , BD Falcon ) and collected in FACS 321 buffer ( 5 mM EDTA , 10 U / ml Heparin in 1x PBS ) . The BD LSR Fortessa Cell Analyzer ( BD 322 Biosciences ) was used for flow cytometry analysis . 323 3 . 6 . WISH 324 Whole - mount RNA in situ hybridization ( WISH ) was performed as described previously 325 ( Aghaallaei et al . , 2007 ) Probes used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . 326 3 . 7 . Wounding assay 327 The wounding assay was adapted from de Oliveira et al . 2013 . Briefly , freshly hatched yolksac 328 larvae were anaesthetized in 40 µg / ml ethyl - m - aminobenzoate methansulfonate ( tricaine ) in 329 ERM . The caudal fin of larvae was cut using sterile surgical blades . Larvae were then 330 immediately mounted in 1 % low - melting agarose containing 40 µg / ml tricaine and live imaged 331 overnight using confocal microscopes ( Zeiss 780 NLO or Leica SP8 ) . The fluorescence 332 intensity over time was calculated using SUM intensity projections , background subtraction , 333 12 intensity was measured along the line of the cut side or along the rim of the fin in uninjured 334 fins . After background subtraction , the fold change was calculated from signal intensity at t x 335 divided by initial ( t 0 ) fluorescence intensity ( t = time ) . 336 3 . 8 . Injection of LPS and bacteria 337 Anesthetized larvae were subcutaneously injected with 50 µg / ml Lipopolysaccaride ( LPS , 338 Sigma ) using a glass needle . Anesthetized adults were injected with PBS containing 339 Staphylococcus aureus BioParticles TM Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate ( ThermoFisher ) . No fish died 340 as a result of the injection . Adult fish were then kept separately in tanks for 16 hours before 341 euthanization and sample preparation for flow cytometry . 342 3 . 9 . In vivo IL - 1 cleavage assay 343 Freshly hatched yolksac larvae were incubated in 3 - 4 ml ERM substituted with different 344 combinations of compounds in a 6 - well plate as shown in Figure 4A . Larvae were first treated 345 with 50 µg / ml LPS for 2 , 5 hours followed by 20 - 50 µm ionomycin ( Cayman Chemicals ) or 50 346 µm nigericin ( Sigma ) for additional 20 - 60 min . The treatment was terminated when larvae 347 showed clear signs of exposure ( immobility ) . Inhibitors MDL - 28170 ( Santa Cruz ) , CA - 74 348 ( Cayman Chemicals ) and Ac - YVAD - cmk ( Sigma ) were added directly to the LPS containing 349 medium and the concentration was kept constant after adding ionomycin into the medium . 350 After treatment , each larva was transferred into a 1 . 5 ml tube on ice for subsequent protein 351 extraction . 30 µl protein extraction buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 , 1 mM 352 CaCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , pH = 8 . 0 , 0 . 9 mM TritonX , 1 mM NaF , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 and proteinase 353 inhibitor ) was then added to the tube . Samples were squished using a pestle . The suspension 354 was kept on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged for 20 min 4°C at 10 . 000 rpm . The supernatant 355 was transferred into a new tube and stored at - 20 °C . To detect proteins , heat denatured larval 356 suspension were run on a 15 % SDS - PAGE and then transferred into a 0 . 45 µM nitrocellulose 357 membrane by semi - dry electroblotting for 35 min at 13 V . Blots were incubated with 1 : 1000 358 anti - HA antibody ( Rabbit , Cell signaling ) , 1 : 20000 anti - GFP ( mouse , Sigma ) and 1 : 20 , 000 anti - 359 actin ( rabbit , Sigma ) . 360 3 . 10 . In vitro IL - 1 cleavage assay 361 For lentiviral overexpression in J774 macrophages , murine IL1a - GLuc , murine IL1b Gluc and 362 medaka IL1 were subcloned into 3rd generation lentivector pLenti6 - EF1alpha - IRES - EGFP ( a 363 derivative of Invitrogen pLenti6 , kindly provided by Jonas Doerr , Institute of Reconstructive 364 Neurobiology , University of Bonn ) via SalI / NotI fusion . Lentiviruses were generated using 365 calcium - phosphate transfection of HEK293T , and J774 macrophages were spin transduced , 366 as described in ( Kutner et al . , 2009 ) and sorted for GFP expression . For inflammasome 367 13 experiments , the luciferase signal was measured directly from the supernatant after addition 368 of the Gaussia luciferase substrate coelenterazine as performed in ( Bartok et al . , 2013 ) . 369 For transient transfection , murine IL1a - GLuc , murine IL1b Gluc and medaka IL1 were 370 subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEFBOS containing a C - term FLAG - tag via 371 XhoI / BamHI fusion . Medaka caspase - 1 and human caspase - 1 were subcloned into pLenti6 - 372 EF1alpha - IRES - EGFP . HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using 373 TransIT - LT1 ( Mirus Bio ) . Cells were lysed with SDS - Sample buffer 24h after transfection and 374 prepared for immunoblotting . To detect proteins , heat denatured samples were run on a 12 % 375 SDS - PAGE and then transferred into a 0 . 2 µM nitrocellulose membrane using wet transfer 376 ( 50min , 100V ) . Blots were incubated with 1 : 1000 Monoclonal ANTI - FLAG® M2 - HRP antibody 377 ( mouse , Sigma ) or 1 : 1000 anti - cleaved Caspase - 3 # 9661 ( rabbit , Cell Signaling Technology ) , 378 followed by 1 : 3000 goat anti - rabbit HRP 1706515 ( BioRad ) . 379 3 . 11 .

( B ) Relative fold - change of luciferase activity upon 606 treatment with different chemical compounds compared to cells treated with only LPS . 607 Mouse J774 macrophages were transfected with pro - IL - 1  - GLuc , pro - IL - 1  - GLuc and 608 medaka Il - 1 - GLuc constructs . Data are representative of 4 independent experiments . 609 ( C ) Relative fold - change of luciferase activity in transfected J774 cells with different 610 iGLuc constructs and subsequent treatment with ionomycin and MDL - 28170 . 611 Transfected cells treated with only LPS were used as a control group . Data are 612 representative of 4 independent experiments . ( D ) WB analysis of transfected 613 HEK293T cells with different constructs expressing IL - 1 and Caspase - 1 cDNAs from 614 the indicated species . Detection of cleaved endogenous Caspase - 3 in transfected cells 615 indicates autoactivation of Caspase - 1 in 293T cells , which do not express GSDMD 616 ( Heilig et al . , 2020 ; Masumoto et al . , 2003 ; Tsuchiya et al . , 2019 ) . 617 25 618 Figure 6 . Caspase - 1 dependent cleavage of IL - 1 in amniotes . ( A ) Alignment of the 619 first 70 amino acids of amniote ( human , mouse ) and anamniote species , showing a 620 conserved aspartic acid residue ( indicated by arrow ) between mammalian IL - 1β and 621 reptiles IL - 1 . The accession numbers of genes used are listed in the Supplementary 622 Table 1 . ( B ) In vitro Caspase - 1 assay showing cleavage of turtle and alligator IL - 1 by 623 human Caspase - 1 .
