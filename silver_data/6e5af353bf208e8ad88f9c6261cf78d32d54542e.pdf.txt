Cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ) has been reported to be the ‘driver’ of this amplicon , however , multiple genes map to the smallest region of ampliﬁcation of 11q13 . Out of these genes , cortactin ( CTTN ) has been shown to be consistently overexpressed at the mRNA level in tumours harbouring 11q13 ampliﬁcation . The aims of this study are to deﬁne whether CTTN is consistently co - ampliﬁed with the main core of the 11q13 amplicon , whether it is consistently overexpressed when ampliﬁed and to determine correlations between CTTN ampliﬁcation and overexpression with clinicopathological features of breast cancers and survival of breast cancer patients . CTTN and CCND1 chromogenic in situ hybridisation ( CISH ) probes and a validated monoclonal antibody against CTTN were applied to a tissue microarray of a cohort of breast cancers from patients treated with anthracycline - based chemotherapy . CTTN and CCND1 ampliﬁcations were found in 12 . 3 and 12 . 4 % of cases , respectively . All cases harbouring CTTN ampliﬁcation also displayed CCND1 ampliﬁcation . High expression of CTTN was found in 10 . 8 % of cases and was associated with CTTN ampliﬁca - tion , expression of ‘basal’ markers and topoisomerase II a . Exploratory subgroup analysis of tumours devoid of 11q13 ampliﬁcation revealed that high expression of CTTN in the absence of CTTN gene ampliﬁcation was associated with lymph node negative disease , lack of hormone receptors and FOXA1 , expression of ‘basal’ markers , high Ki - 67 indices , p53 nuclear expression , and basal - like and triple negative phenotypes . CTTN expression and CTTN gene ampliﬁcation were not associated with disease - , metastasis - free and overall survival . In conclusion , CTTN is consis - tently co - ampliﬁed with CCND1 and expressed at higher levels in breast cancers harbouring 11q13 ampliﬁcation , suggesting that CTTN may also constitute one of the drivers of this amplicon . CTTN expression is not associ - ated with the outcome of breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline - based chemotherapy . Keywords Breast cancer (cid:2) Chromogenic in situ hybridisation (cid:2) Immunohistochemistry (cid:2) 11q13 ampliﬁcation (cid:2) CCND1 (cid:2) CTTN Introduction The cortactin gene ( CTTN , formerly know as EMS1 ) maps to 11q13 [ 1 – 3 ] and produces a cytoplasmic protein that is a key regulator of actin polymerisation through binding and activating the actin - regulated protein complex ( ARP2 / 3 ) [ 1 ] . CTTN has been shown to play a critical role in various actin - mediated processes such as cell migration , adhesion and receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 2 , 4 ] .

The 11q13 amplicon is complex and encompasses multiple cores [ 6 , 8 , 14 , 16 – 23 ] . Out of the genes mapping to this amplicon , cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ) has been suggested as the main ‘driver’ ( i . e . the gene whose expression would confer advantage to cancer cells harbouring its ampliﬁcation ) [ 9 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 19 , 23 – 25 ] . Contrary to the initial concept that each amplicon would have one ‘driver’ , recent studies have demonstrated that within each amplicon , there may be more than one gene whose expression and activity is selectively required for the survival of cancer cells har - bouring its ampliﬁcation . For instance , on the 17q12 amplicon , HER2 has been shown to be the main ‘driver’ ; however , expression of GRB7 and STARD3 has also been shown to be required for the survival of cancer cells with 17q12 ampliﬁcation [ 26 ] . We [ 6 , 27 – 30 ] and others [ 20 , 31 ] have demonstrated that in tumours with 11q13 ampliﬁcation , CTTN maps to the smallest region of ampliﬁcation of the 11q13 amplicon and is consistently overexpressed at the mRNA level when ampliﬁed . This observation would suggest that CTTN may constitute a potential amplicon driver . CTTN has been shown to be overexpressed in many types of human can - cers , including head and neck and oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas [ 21 , 32 , 33 ] , hepatocellular cancer [ 34 ] and breast cancer [ 8 , 19 ] . In agreement with these observations , in vitro and in vivo studies of breast cancer [ 35 – 37 ] , hepatocellular carcinoma [ 34 ] and head and neck squa - mous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) [ 33 , 38 , 39 ] have suggested that CTTN plays a role in tumour invasion and metastasis . In breast cancer , CTTN overexpression is often reported to be underpinned by chromosomal ampliﬁcation of the 11q13 . 3 region [ 8 , 19 ] , however , overexpression has also been reported in tumours without ampliﬁcation [ 8 , 19 ] . The aims of this study were ( i ) to deﬁne whether CTTN is consistently co - ampliﬁed with the main core of the 11q13 amplicon , ( ii ) to determine the correlations between CTTN ampliﬁcation and overexpression with clinicopath - ological features of breast cancers and survival of breast cancer patients and ( iii ) to test whether tumours with 11q13 ampliﬁcation consistently overexpress CTTN at the protein level . Materials and methods Tissue microarrays A cohort of 245 patients with invasive breast cancer ( 185 invasive ductal carcinomas , 27 invasive lobular carcinomas , 25 invasive mixed carcinomas and 8 invasive breast carci - nomas of other special types ) treated with therapeutic surgery followed by adjuvant anthracycline - based chemotherapy were included in a tissue microarray ( TMA ) containing two replicate 0 . 6 - mm cores . All patients were diagnosed and managed at the Royal Marsden Hospital , London , UK , between 1994 and 2000 . All patients were primarily treated with surgery ( 69 mastectomy and 156 wide local excision ) followed by anthracycline - based chemotherapy . Adjuvant endocrine therapy was prescribed for patients with ER - posi - tive tumours ( tamoxifen alone in 96 . 4 % of the patients for the available follow - up period ) . Complete follow - up was avail - able for 244 patients , ranging from 0 . 5 to 125 months ( median = 67 months , mean = 67 months ) . Tumours were graded according to a modiﬁed Bloom – Richardson scoring system [ 40 ] and size was categorised according to the TNM staging [ 41 ] . The study was approved by the Royal Marsden Hospital Ethics Committee . Chromogenic in situ hybridisation We developed an in - house generated CTTN probe com - posed of three bacterial artiﬁcial chromosomes ( BACs , RP11 - 240K12 , RP11 - 517E18 and RP11 - 347I13 ) , which map to 69 , 867 – 70 , 330 kb on chromosome 11 and encom - pass the genes CTTN , ANO1 , FADD , PPFA1 and part of SHANK2 . BACs were digoxigenin labelled as previously described [ 42 ] . In addition , chromogenic in situ hybrid - isation ( CISH ) with probes for CCND1 , MYC , HER2 and TOP2A was performed as previously described [ 9 , 15 , 42 ] . The CCND1 probe maps to the smallest region of ampli - ﬁcation on 11q13 as previously deﬁned by high - resolution microarray - based comparative genomic hybridisation analysis [ 6 , 27 – 30 ] . Hybridisation using the digoxigenin - labelled in - house probe for CTTN and the ready - to - use digoxigenin - labelled SpotLight ampliﬁcation probes for CCND1 , MYC , HER2 and TOP2A ampliﬁcation ( Invitro - gen , Carlsbad , California ) were hybridised to sections of the TMAs as previously described [ 42 ] . CISH experiments were analysed by three of the authors ( MAL - G , FCG and JSR - F ) on a multiheaded microscope with observers blin - ded to CTTN expression levels and clinicopathological features . Ampliﬁcation was deﬁned as [ 5 signals per nucleus or large gene copy clusters in more than 50 % of cancer cells [ 9 , 15 , 42 ] . The results of the correlations between CCND1 gene ampliﬁcation and clinicopathologi - cal features and patients’ survival in this cohort of breast cancers are reported elsewhere [ 9 ] . Immunohistochemistry Sections of the TMA were cut at 4 l m and mounted on polylysine - coated slides and immunohistochemistry was 654 Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2010 ) 124 : 653 – 666 123 performed with antibodies raised against CTTN ( clone 30 , dilution 1 : 1000 , BD Transduction Laboratories , cat no . 610049 ) . Slides were blocked in 1 . 5 % H 2 O 2 in methanol for 10 min and detection achieved using the Vector avidin – biotin complex ( ABC ) system ( Vector Laboratories , Bur - lingame , CA , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s rec - ommendations . The antibody was applied for 60 min following heat - induced antigen retrieval for 18 min in citrate buffer pH 6 . 0 in a microwave oven . Development was carried out using the chromogen 3 , 3 0 - Diaminobenzi - dine ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) . Positive controls inclu - ded formalin - ﬁxed pellets of ovarian and breast cancer cell lines , whose CTTN mRNA and protein expression levels were determined by analysis of unﬁxed cells with Illumina WG6 v2 expression arrays [ 43 , 44 ] or in - house cDNA arrays , and Western blotting using the same antibody employing a previously validated method [ 43 ] , respec - tively . Negative controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of the primary antibody by IgG - matched control . CTTN immunohistochemical intensity and distribution were semiquantitatively scored by three of the authors ( MAL - G , FCG and JSR - F ) on a multiheaded microscope using the ‘quick score’ system [ 45 ] ( intensity 0 – 3 9 dis - tribution 0 – 6 ) with observers blinded to 11q13 status and clinicopathological features . Membranous and cytoplasmic expressions were considered speciﬁc . Tumours were then categorised in three groups according to their CTTN expression levels as low \ 5 , intermediate 5 – 12 and [ 12 as high . The details of the immunohistochemical methods and scoring systems for ER , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , HER2 , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , cytokeratin ( Ck ) 14 , Ck 5 / 6 and Ck 17 , Ki - 67 , p53 , topoisomerase II alpha , caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) and caveolin - 2 ( CAV2 ) , FOXA1 , E - cadherin , CD44 , Bcl2 , nestin and cyclin D1 detection are described elsewhere [ 46 – 51 ] and summarised in Supple - mentary Table 1 . Based upon the expression of HER2 , ER , Ck 5 / 6 and EGFR , tumours were classiﬁed into basal , HER2 and luminal according to the immunohistochemical panel proposed by Nielsen et al . [ 52 ] . Statistical analysis The SPSS statistical software package was used for all statistical analysis . Correlations between categorical vari - ables were performed using the Chi - square test and Fish - er’s exact test . Metastasis - free survival ( MFS ) was expressed as the number of months from diagnosis to the occurrence of distant relapse . Disease - free survival ( DFS ) was expressed as the number of months from diagnosis to the occurrence of distant , local relapse or death ( disease - related death ) . Overall survival was expressed as the number of months from diagnosis to the occurrence of breast - cancer - related death . Cumulative survival probabil - ities were calculated using the Kaplan – Meier method . Differences between survival rates were tested with the log - rank test . A P value of 0 . 05 was considered as statis - tically signiﬁcant . Results CTTN is co - ampliﬁed with CCND1 To test whether the CTTN gene maps to the smallest region of ampliﬁcation on 11q13 , we subjected a series of breast cancers to CISH with probes for CTTN and CCND1 , which maps to the smallest region of ampliﬁcation on chromo - some 11 . CISH for CTTN and CCND1 was interpretable in 146 and 242 cases , respectively . Eighteen ( 12 . 3 % ) and thirty ( 12 . 4 % ) cases harboured ampliﬁcation of CTTN and CCND1 , respectively ( Table 1 ) . All cases with CTTN ampliﬁcation displayed CCND1 ampliﬁcation and all cases harbouring CCND1 ampliﬁcation and interpretable results for CCTN were also co - ampliﬁed . Taken together , these CISH results validate the results of previous microarray - based comparative genomic hybridisation analysis which suggested that CTTN is part of the smallest region of ampliﬁcation [ 6 , 19 , 27 ] of the 11q13 amplicon and is consistently co - ampliﬁed with CCND1 .

Table 2 summarises the correlations between CTTN ampliﬁcation and clinicopathological fea - tures and immunohistochemical ﬁndings in breast carci - nomas . In brief , CTTN ampliﬁcation showed a statistically signiﬁcant association with cyclin D1 expression ( Table 2 ) . CTTN expression The correlations between CTTN expression and clinico - pathological features and immunohistochemical ﬁndings in breast carcinomas are summarised in Table 3 . Brieﬂy , out of the 245 cases included in the TMAs , cores from 59 cases were either lost / fragmented in the immunohistochemical procedure or did not have invasive tumour . Out of the 186 remaining cores , 25 ( 13 . 4 % ) cases displayed low ( quick score \ 5 ) expression of CTTN , 141 ( 75 . 8 % ) cases had intermediate expression ( quick score 5 – 12 ) and 20 ( 10 . 8 % ) cases exhibited high expression ( quick score [ 12 ) of CTTN ( Fig . 1 ) . Expression of CTTN was signiﬁcantly associated with expression of ‘basal’ markers , including Ck14 , Ck17 and Caveolin 1 expression , topoisomerase II a expression but not TOPO2A gene ampliﬁcation , and normal levels of E - cadherin expression ( Table 3 ) . As described for the associations between CTTN ampliﬁcation and mRNA expression [ 6 ] , CTTN protein expression was strongly associated with CTTN ampliﬁca - tion ( Mann – Whitney U test , P = 0 . 00002 ; Table 1 ) . Expression of CTTN in breast cancers lacking 11q13 ampliﬁcation To investigate the associations between CTTN expression levels and clinicopathological features in the absence of 11q13 ampliﬁcation , we removed cases harbouring 11q13 ampliﬁcation ( n = 30 ; i . e . all cases harbouring ampliﬁca - tion of CTTN and / or CCND1 ) and cases where 11q13 status could not be deﬁned by at least one of the probes ( n = 3 ) . In this series of 212 breast cancers , data on CTTN expression was available for 156 cases , of which 24 cases were classiﬁed as CTTN low , 126 as intermediate and 6 as high ( Table 4 ) . Expression of CTTN in this subgroup of cancers was signiﬁcantly associated with lymph node negative disease , lack of markers of luminal differentiation ( i . e . ER , PR and FOXA1 ) , expression of ‘basal’ markers ( EGFR , Ck5 / 6 , Ck14 and Ck17 , Caveolin 1 , Caveolin 2 , and nestin ) , high Ki - 67 labelling indices and p53 nuclear expression . All cases with high CTTN expression lacked HER2 gene ampliﬁcation . Not surprisingly , CTTN expression in the absence of 11q13 ampliﬁcation was signiﬁcantly more prevalent in breast cancers of basal - like and triple negative phenotype ( Table 4 ) . Survival analysis Univariate survival analysis failed to show any association between MFS , DFS and OS for CTTN expression , CTTN ampliﬁcation or CTTN expression among cases without 11q13 - ampliﬁcation . Discussion Ampliﬁcation of CCND1 is reported to be found in up to 15 % of invasive breast cancers . Here , we have conﬁrmed that ampliﬁcation of CTTN is found in 12 . 3 % of cases , whereas ampliﬁcation of CCND1 was found in 12 . 4 % of cases . Importantly , in all cases harbouring CTTN ampliﬁ - cation CCND1 was also co - ampliﬁed . Likewise , in all cases where both CCND1 and CTTN were interpretable , CCND1 was always found to be co - ampliﬁed with CTTN . These results corroborate previous observations derived from microarray - based comparative genomic hybridisation studies [ 6 , 27 ] that suggested that CTTN is part of the smallest region of ampliﬁcation of the CCND1 amplicon on 11q13 . High expression of CTTN has been previously reported to be present in 27 . 1 % of breast cancers at the protein level [ 19 ] and in 18 . 5 % at the mRNA level [ 8 ] . Here , high expression , as deﬁned by immunohistochemical analysis , was observed in 10 . 8 % of cases . Within cases harbouring CTTN ampliﬁcation , CTTN is consistently expressed at higher levels , supporting the evidence of previous studies on breast cancer [ 8 , 19 , 20 , 27 , 31 ] and other tumour types [ 21 , 32 , 33 ] that CTTN may be one of the 11q13 amplicon drivers . In fact , out of our 17 cases where both CTTN ampliﬁcation and expression could be analysed , only 1 case had low CTTN expression . When 11q13 ampliﬁcation , as deﬁned by CTTN or CCND1 ampliﬁcation , was considered , out of the 27 cases where both 11q13 ampliﬁcation and CTTN levels could be analysed , 48 % of cases with 11q13 ampliﬁcation displayed high protein levels of CTTN . This is in agreement with Lundgren et al . [ 19 ] , who reported that 44 % of cases with 11q13 ampliﬁcation display CTTN overexpression . Previous studies have suggested that CTTN mRNA levels would be of higher levels in ER - positive breast cancers [ 8 ] ; however , this observation may have stemmed from the higher prevalence of 11q13 ampliﬁcation in ER - positive breast cancers and the correlation between 11q13 ampliﬁcation and CTTN mRNA overexpression [ 5 , 6 , 27 , 31 , 53 , 54 ] .

vations . However , low expression of CTTN was predictive of response to tamoxifen treatment , suggesting that CTTN would be expressed at higher levels in ER - negative than in ER - positive cancers [ 19 ] . Here , we demonstrate that when cases harbouring 11q13 ampliﬁcation were excluded , CTTN was indeed expressed at higher levels in ER - nega - tive breast cancers of triple negative and basal - like phenotype . We have also observed an association between high expression of CTTN and EGFR overexpression , which was previously reported in HNSCC [ 55 ] but not in breast can - cers . This observation may be explained by results from studies in HNSCC cell lines [ 56 , 57 ] which indicate that CTTN could participate in receptor - mediated endocytosis of EGFR . Thus , CTTN overexpression attenuated ligand - induced downregulation of EGFR and led to sustained activation of EGFR signalling . Conversely , reduction of CTTN expression in an 11q13 - ampliﬁed HNSCC cell line by RNA interference accelerated EGFR degradation [ 57 ] . Recent studies have demonstrated that CTTN constitutes an important signalling pathway that is functionally linked to E - cadherin adhesion [ 58 ] .

Consistent with this observation , here we demonstrate that cases with higher levels of CTTN expression displayed normal levels of E - cadherin expression signiﬁcantly more frequently . Here , we describe a signiﬁcantly higher prevalence of overexpression of CTTN expression in a subgroup of basal - like and triple negative cancers when compared to other breast cancers lacking CTTN and / or 11q13 ampliﬁcation . CTTN has been shown to play pivotal roles in the migra - tion and invasion of cancer cells [ 39 ] . Consistent with these observations , basal - like and triple negative breast cancer cell lines have been shown to have a more invasive phe - notype than non - triple negative breast cancer cell lines [ 59 ] . This is not surprising , given that CTTN is phos - phorylated by SRC , a tyrosine kinase whose in vitro inhi - bition is lethal in a subgroup of basal - like and triple negative breast cancers [ 60 , 61 ] and shown to be involved in breast cancer cell migration and invasion [ 62 ] . Further functional studies to investigate whether CTTN overex - pression in a subgroup of basal - like and triple negative breast cancers is driven by a global transcriptomic pro - gramme that promotes a more invasive phenotype or if it is a consequence of SRC activation are warranted . Despite the numerous lines of evidence to demonstrate that CTTN may be one of the drivers of the 11q13 amplicon and that CTTN has oncogenic properties , previ - ous studies have failed to ﬁnd an association between CTTN expression and outcome in breast cancer [ 8 , 19 ] . In our analysis of a homogeneous cohort of breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline - based chemother - apy ± endocrine therapy , which would be representative of up to 70 % of all breast cancer patients , no associations between CTTN expression or CTTN gene ampliﬁcation and outcome were found . Our ﬁndings should be interpreted with caution , however , as this is a retrospective , single institution study . Furthermore , the prevalence of cases displaying CTTN overexpression and CTTN gene ampliﬁ - cation is relatively low ( \ 15 % ) ; therefore , it is plausible that in larger cohorts with longer follow - up , associations with survival may be identiﬁed . Further studies testing the prognostic impact of CTTN gene ampliﬁcation in larger cohorts of breast cancer patients are warranted . In conclusion , high expression of CTTN is present in a small proportion ( * 12 % ) of invasive breast cancers and is strongly associated with CTTN gene ampliﬁcation and co - ampliﬁcation with CCND1 . We also demonstrate that all cases harbouring CTTN ampliﬁcation also displayed CCND1 ampliﬁcation and that [ 90 % of cases with CTTN ampliﬁcation display moderate - to - high levels of CTTN expression , providing another line of evidence to suggest that CTTN may be one of the drivers of the 11q13 ampli - con . CTTN expression and CTTN gene ampliﬁcation failed to show an association with outcome in a cohort of breast cancers homogeneously treated with anthracycline - based chemotherapy . In cases devoid of 11q13 ( i . e . CTTN and / or CCND1 ) ampliﬁcation , CTTN was expressed at higher levels in ER - negative cancers of triple negative and basal - like phenotype . These observations illustrate the impor - tance of reducing the complexity of breast cancers a priori in studies aiming to determine whether a given gene is consistently overexpressed when ampliﬁed , as the molec - ular subtype of the tumours may inﬂuence the baseline expression levels of a gene . Finally , our data warrant fur - ther studies to deﬁne whether CTTN is one of the ‘drivers’ of the 11q13 amplicon in breast cancer and to determine whether basal - like cancer cells or luminal cancer cells with 11q13 ampliﬁcation would require expression of CTTN for their survival and migration .
