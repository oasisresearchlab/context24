A content analysis approach Erastus Karanja 1 · Aditya Sharma 1 · Ibrahim Salama 2 Received : 10 August 2019 / Published online : 21 December 2019 © Akadémiai Kiadó , Budapest , Hungary 2019 Abstract Diversity and representativeness are two enriching components of an academic field and for quite some time , Management Information Systems ( MIS ) researchers have been advo - cating for more studies on them . The objective of this study is to investigate the extent to which survey - based research articles reflect diversity in MIS research and to evaluate representativeness in journals in the MIS field . Diversity is a multifaceted concept that can be delineated along several constructs such as diversity in research approach , diversity in theories , and diversity in research methods . Survey research is the dominant research method in the MIS field accounting for 32 – 41 % of published empirical research studies . In this study , diversity is conceptualized and explored through six factors that are easily identifiable in a survey - based research article namely the unit of analysis , research top - ics , type of respondents , number of authors , number of schools of authors , and number of country of authors . The study makes use of a set of 1466 survey - based research articles published over 21 years in 15 mainstream MIS journals in Europe and the USA to study diversity and representativeness using Tsallis entropy and Chi - Square statistics . The results present an overview of the state of the MIS survey - based research in Europe and the USA while also revealing that MIS researchers are predominantly gathering survey data from business executives at the firm and individual units of analysis in both regions . Overall , we find dominant categories ( top 2 ) emerge for each factor as they relate to diversity both in Europe and the USA with three factors having the same dominant categories indicating that diversity continues to elude the MIS research field . The results have implications for both research and practice in the MIS field .

Since then , the MIS field ( MIS is hereafter used to refer to Management / Computer Information Systems , Infor - mation Science and Systems , or Information Systems / Technology ) has been characterized by rapid growth and constant evolution in many domains . This phenomenon has differenti - ated the field from its founding disciplines namely computer science , organizational the - ory , operations research , psychology , management , and accounting ( Thatcher et al . 2018 ; Taylor et al . 2010 ) . Currently , we continue to witness a proliferation and embeddedness of IS resources into many organizations’ business processes and everyday societal endeav - ors ( Huang and Hsu 2005 ) . Rapid growth and constant evolution give the MIS field an apparent feel of diversity , and for quite some time now , MIS researchers have advocated for diversity and representativeness in the field ( Banker and Kauffman 2004 ; Burgess et al . 2016 ; Galliers and Huang 2012 ) . Diversity is a multifaceted concept that can be delineated along several constructs such as diversity in research topics , diversity in theories and diversity in research methods ( Ben - basat and Weber 1996 ; Galliers and Huang 2012 ) as well as functional diversity ( Qian et al . 2013 ) . The issue of diversity has pre - occupied MIS research for a while . For example , Galliers and Land ( 1987 ) called for diversity in MIS research methods and discouraged the tendency by MIS researchers and institutions to confine their research undertakings to specific empirical research methods irrespective of the research question at hand . Their call echoed the sentiments of Landry and Banville ( 1992 ) who pointed out that the MIS field seems to adopt a fragmented research paradigm . Landry and Banville ( 1992 ) further argued that MIS field cannot afford to adopt a methodological monism but should be biased towards a disciplined methodological pluralism ( read diversity ) to enrich the research out - put and knowledge dissemination ( Goyal et al . 2018 ) . Elsewhere , Orlikowski and Baroudi ( 1991 ) sought to extend the debate on diversity by investigating the dominant research design and epistemology in the MIS field . Their results revealed that MIS research was dominated by the positivist research paradigm ( Galliers and Huang 2012 ) and three research designs namely surveys , case studies , and labora - tory experiments—with these three research designs accounting for over 90 % of all MIS research articles . As a result , Orlikowski and Baroudi ( 1991 ) pointed out that the use of a single research perspective in investigating MIS phenomena was very restrictive and might not auger well for the field and , consequently , called for a shift to more diverse and plu - ralistic research approaches such as critical and interpretive research methods ( Urquhart and Fernández 2016 ; Hirschheim and Klein 2012 ) . In furthering the MIS diversity debate through the investigation of research topics , Alavi and Carlson ( 1992 ) carried out a study that examined the growth and convergence of the MIS field and reported that although MIS research exhibits a mosaic of research topics ( Taylor et al . 2010 ) , the top three most popu - lar research topics in MIS were IS management , IS types and characteristics , and develop - ment and operations systems . Their study has been extended on several fronts by several researchers ( Goyal et al . 2018 ; Palvia et al . 2015 ) and a recent study based on topic mod - eling revealed that topics on IS development , IT adoption , and IS usage continue to domi - nate MIS field ( Jeyaraj and Zadeh 2019 ) . On a global level , Evaristo and Karahanna ( 1997 ) sought to study diversity in the MIS field and reported that the most popular research methods used by MIS researchers in the USA are quantitative and empirical field studies ( Palvia et al . 2015 ) , whereas , in Europe , 1585 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 MIS researchers tended to adopt qualitative and conceptual non - empirical research meth - ods . Additionally , Galliers and Meadows ( 2003 ) sought to investigate diversity and repre - sentativeness issues in the MIS field and reported intuitive results . By analyzing the major journals in the USA and comparing their research output to those in Europe , the researchers revealed that most of the USA domiciled journals were edited by USA based editors and tended to publish research from authors working in USA institutions ( Baccini and Barabesi 2010 ) . This phenomenon was also observed in the Europe domiciled journals , reiterating the lack of diversity , at least in editorship and authorship ( Harzing and Metz 2013 ) , in the MIS research . Additionally , Vessey et al . ( 2002 ) analyzed research in the MIS discipline based on the contributing discipline ( Tarafdar and Davison 2018 ) , unit of analysis , research method , and research approach and concluded that MIS researchers had not headed the call for cultural pluralism in MIS research . A detailed synopsis of the aforementioned and other diversity - related studies is detailed in Table 1 . Based on the aforesaid , and other studies , survey - based research has emerged as the dominant research method in the MIS field ( Kim et al . 2010 ; Palvia et al . 2015 ) account - ing for up to 41 % of the published empirical research studies . The preference for surveys as a data collection method is based on the premise that , when well implemented , surveys provide deeper insights into individuals’ perceptions and attitudes as well as organizations’ practices and policies in a convenient , private , and confidential environment ( Bell 1996 ; McIntyre 1999 ) . Also , since MIS transcends all the functional spheres of an organization , surveys are deemed an appropriate research method not only at the individual level of anal - ysis but also at the intra and inter - organizational level because of the inherent strengths of surveys at assessing and capturing intra and inter - organizational relationships and con - cerns , as well as recording and facilitating the evaluation of trend data over time ( Baruch and Holtom 2008 ; Kraut 1996 ) . Survey - based research studies are usually characterized by several factors namely unit of analysis , research topics , and type of respondents , et al . ( Glasow 2005 ; Visser et al . 2000 ) . Generally , these factors in survey - based research are well defined and universally accepted making their collective deployment and consequent interpretation less problem - atic . Consequently , this study incorporates these factors namely unit of analysis , research topics , type of respondents , and adds other factors such as number of authors , number of schools of authors , and number of country of authors to investigate how diversity and rep - resentativeness are reflected in the MIS field . The data set for this research is comprised of 1466 MIS research articles that either used surveys exclusively or survey was the main data collection method . The sampled survey - based articles were gathered from 15 mainstream MIS journals ( Gallivan and Benbunan - Fich 2007 ; Lowry et al . 2007 ) that were published in Europe and the USA throughout 21 - years . The authors note that this study does not pur - port to investigate the underlying concepts that govern surveys as a research method or the application or appropriateness of surveys in the MIS field but uses survey - based articles , based on the popularity of the research method , as the source of data . The current study makes several contributions . To start with , the study presents the state of survey research in the MIS field while concurrently identifying gaps in the field and thus makes available information to guide new scholars ( doctoral students—who are the future of the discipline ) as well as the new and existing faculty research develop - ment initiatives . Also , the results provide insights into whether MIS survey research has contributed to the elusive diversification and representativeness in the MIS field ( Vessey et al . 2002 ) as exemplified by the research factors under investigations , namely unit of analysis , research topics , type of respondents , number of authors , number of schools of authors , and number of country of authors .

Thirdly , by comparing the results of the studies published in Europe to those studies published in the USA , the researchers aim at unraveling how diversity and rep - resentativeness are manifested for each of the factors in these regions and whether MIS scholars are moving together or whether there are significant differences between these two regions . The choice of the two regions was driven by the prior MIS studies that have reported that most of the MIS research journals are domiciled in these two regions ( Galliers and Meadows 2003 ; Zhang et al . 2009 ) and that there are salient differences and similarities in the research outputs ( Im et al . 1998 ) from the two regions ( Evaristo and Karahanna 1997 ; La Paz et al . , 2019 ) . The inclusion of other regions ( e . g . Asia , Australia , and Africa ) is deferred for a future study . This article is organized as follows : A brief background review highlights why diver - sity is important to the MIS field , and besides , an overview of the research questions and research factors , the research methodology , data collection , processing , and analysis are discussed . Study results and findings are explored along with an identification of the study’s limitations and suggestions for future research . Background Why diversity in the MIS field ? Some of the arguments for promoting diversity in the MIS research are grounded on the premise that a more diverse research environment expands the foundations on which claims in MIS are based and thus lends more credibility to the research findings ( Keller and Coulthard 2013 ; Mingers 2001 ) . For instance , including good researchers from diverse academic and industry backgrounds ( Hardaway et al . 2016 ) to study the MIS phenomenon enriches the MIS field because they bring different viewpoints , use different theoretical lenses , and generate new insights . Also , by understanding the state of diversity in the MIS field , researchers in the field will nurture creativity and innovativeness ( Khan and Trier 2019 ) while simultaneously propagating the concept of academic freedom and thinking outside the box ( Robey 1996 ) . “Academic cross - pollination” , a concept achieved through collaboration with researchers in other disciplines , enriches the MIS field by incorporat - ing different theories , perspectives , and knowledge from these disciplines into the MIS research questions and offers insightful findings ( Tarafdar and Davison 2018 ) . MIS is a very dynamic and diverse field , and as such , MIS researchers should engage the practition - ers who are directly impacted by the rapid changes in technology to understand how MIS artifacts affect business operations and day to day activities . While investigating or tracking the progression of research in the MIS field , researchers often adopt several approaches . The most common approaches used to track the progress of academic fields have been the study of research methods used in the fields , research topics / themes , reference disciplines , researchers’ productivity , and cultural orientations . Most of the studies in Table 1 can be viewed as macro in nature mainly because the researchers concentrate on the breadth of the chosen domains with minimal emphasis on the depth of coverage . The current study differs from these prior studies in that it is nar - rower in scope and covers only one research method ( survey ) in - depth and investigates 1595 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 how the associated elements in survey research reflect diversity and representativeness in the MIS field . Research questions and diversity factors Based on prior studies , MIS researchers have shown that diversity is a multifaceted con - cept that can be measured through several domains . Some of the domains that have been used before in capturing diversity include research questions , theoretical foundations , ref - erence disciplines , and research methods ( Benbasat and Weber 1996 ; Keller and Coul - thard 2013 ) . In this study , we extrapolate the research methods domain to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of diversity in the MIS field . Although this study is limited to the survey research method , it includes other measures of diversity - focused not only on the factors pertaining to research method / design , namely unit of analysis , research topics , types of respondents ( also referred to as research factors ) but also on the factors pertain - ing to authorship such as number of authors , country of authors , and number of schools of authors also referred to as authorship factors . The following section expounds on each of these diversity factors . Diversity as measured by the unit of analysis The unit of analysis refers to the survey research target , entity , or point of contact between the researcher ( s ) and the environment in which the research is carried out . Unit of analysis also refers to the level at which the data is aggregated during the analysis and may include individuals , organizations / firms , projects , groups / teams , inter - organizational / firm - dyads , systems , nations , cultures , etc . ( Sekaran and Bougie 2016 ) . According to Bariff and Ginz - berg ( 1982 ) , there are usually four main units of analysis in behavioral IS research namely , individual , group , organization / firm , and society . It is not unusual to encounter units of analysis that are intimately intertwined , but in this research , the authors made efforts to classify the units of analysis according to the most dominant type . The study adopts these four categories namely individual , group / team , organization / firm and inter - organizational / firm - dyads along with three other salient categories of units of analysis namely project , society / country , and system , leading to a total of seven categories . The factor and catego - ries used to represent the unit of analysis are based on prior work ( Vessey et al . 2002 ; Bar - iff and Ginzberg 1982 ) . A journal that exhibits diversity will have articles that are based on an evenly distributed list of units of analysis . On the other hand , lack of diversity will be exhibited by articles that are concentrated in only a few of the units of analysis . Thus , the research questions can be stated as ; Q1a : What are the dominant units of analysis in MIS survey research ? Q1b : How diverse are the MIS journals in the units of analysis ? Q1c : How representative of diversity are Europe based and the USA based MIS jour - nals in the units of analysis ? 1596 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 Diversity as measured by research topics The progression of an academic field can be measured by the number and newness of the research topics pursued by academics and practitioners in that field . Prior work in the MIS field has identified several major topics in the field . For instance , Palvia et al . ( 2015 ) reported that e - commerce was the most dominant research topic between 2004 and 2013 , while earlier on Alavi and Carlson ( 1992 ) found that the top three most popular research topics were IS management , IS types and characteristics , and development and operation of systems based on research articles published between 1968 and 1988 . Recently , Jeyaraj and Zadeh ( 2019 ) used keyword analysis in six major MIS journals and reported that top - ics on IS development , IT adoption , and IS usage have endured over time while others , such as social media , design science , online communities , have recently emerged . Thus , research studies that cover a wide range of topics are indicative of diversity in the journal and serve to enrich the field by articulating different perspectives on how the MIS artifacts being investigated adapt to the various environmental settings / stimuli . In line with the prior works in this area , this study developed and classified research articles under ten major cat - egories ( “Appendix” Table 18 ) to determine the diversity of the research topic ( s ) published in Europe based and USA based journals . Since this study uses survey - based research arti - cles as the data points , the study of research topics is constrained to the topics that were investigated using surveys as the data collection tool . Although this may seem like a draw - back , we note that the survey is the dominant empirical research method in the MIS field ( Kim et al . 2010 ; Orlikowski and Baroudi 1991 ) accounting for up to 41 % of the published empirical research studies ( Chen and Hirschheim 2004 ) . Thus , the research questions can be stated as ; Q2a : What are the dominant research topics in MIS survey research ? Q2b : How diverse are the MIS journals in the research topics ? Q2c : How representative of diversity are the Europe and USA based MIS journals in the research topics ? Diversity as measured by types of respondents Researchers target various subjects and seek to solicit their feedback in order to answer the research questions and , hence shed more light on the phenomenon under investigation . The type of respondent refers to the groups or individuals who are targeted for solicitation during the survey research process . Respondents are the actual subjects that populate the survey questions and maybe key informants who are knowledgeable about specific aspects of the entity under investigation or are general respondents who are familiar with the entity . Some types of respondents based on prior MIS survey research studies include students , employees , IT managers , and customers . Survey researchers must be cognizant of the fac - tors associated with non - response bias and should work towards minimizing both the non - response bias and its inherent statistical shortcomings ( Kanuk and Berenson 1975 ; Karanja et al . 2013 ) . The quality of the responses in survey research is important because the way the respondents understand the survey questions , synthesize a response , and communicate the answer can impact the quality of the findings . In survey research , some respondents are easier to access and solicit feedback from e . g . students , while other types of respondents , such as the members of the TMT , are elusive and may require significant investments in monetary and time resources to solicit feedback from them . This study makes use of seven 1597 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 categories of respondents which included IT Executives , Business Executives , IT Execu - tives and Top Management Teams , IT Professionals , Employees , IT Users ( customers ) and Students . Hence , the research questions can be stated as ; Q3a : What are the dominant types of respondents in MIS survey research ? Q3b : How diverse are the MIS journals in the types of respondents ? Q3c : How representative of diversity are the Europe and USA based MIS journals in the types of respondents ? Diversity as measured by the number of the authors In an academic field , the creation , fostering , and dissemination of knowledge is usually accomplished through many channels with one of the most common being research articles ( Howard and Garland 2015 ) . On many occasions , researchers seek to build on each other’s research strength through research collaborations and co - authorship . There are no general rules that dictate the number of authors in an academic article , although field - specific rules and norms about the single or multiple co - authorships can impact hiring , tenure , and promotion decisions ( Bowen 2013 ; Everard et al . 2017 ; Haj - Bolouri and Flensburg 2017 ) . In the recent past , the instances of co - authorship in the MIS field have been on the rise , and some of the factors attributed to this trend are improved paper quality , access to expertise , access to equipment , access to research tools or data , mentoring , prestige or visibility ( Bandodkar and Grover 2016 ) . Previ - ous research has provided evidence that points to the fact that the number of authors is correlated with the article’s or publication’s impact factor and the number of citations ( Tahamtan et al . 2016 ; Everard et al . 2017 ) . This article seeks to explore this research dimension by aggregating the data on the number of authors per article in the sampled MIS journals to answer the following questions : Q4a : What are the dominant numbers of authors in MIS survey research ? Q4b : How diverse are the MIS journals in the number of the authors ? Q4c : How representative of diversity are the Europe and USA based MIS journals in the number of the authors ? Diversity as measured by the number of country of the authors The MIS field is a key player in enabling the global flat world ( Beck 2000 ; Friedman 2005 ) . Also , the MIS field is very dynamic field and as such MIS researchers are con - fronted by the need to keep up with the changes in technologies ( Benamati and Lederer 2001 ; Durney and Donnelly 2015 ) . Because of the global and dynamic nature of the MIS field , MIS research has the potential to impact policy and practice as well as con - tribute to the evolving body of global research . The embeddedness and global nature of MIS imply that MIS research should reflect this diversity through many facets such as the country where the researchers are domiciled and also whether they are affili - ated to an industry ( Hardaway et al . 2016 ) within a country or across countries . Having researchers from various geographical regions collaborate on a research project should enrich the research study by offering different perspectives on how the MIS artifact being investigated adapts to the various environmental settings / stimuli . International collaboration is one of the metrics that has been used to evaluate and predict the quality 1598 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 of research articles ( Tahamtan et al . 2016 ) . In this study , we focus our research ques - tions on the number of countries from which authors come as reflected within a specific article . Thus , we seek to find out Q5a : What are the dominant number of countries of authors in MIS survey research ? Q5b : How diverse are the MIS journals in the country of the authors ? Q5c : How representative of diversity are the Europe and USA based MIS journals in the country of the authors ? Diversity as measured by the number of schools of the authors Collaboration in research may be facilitated by the location of the authors , schools attended , dissertation committees’ memberships , and prior research engagements , among other factors . For instance , authors who are near each other can benefit from face to face interactions that yield frequent and richer information exchanges as well as improve the research outputs ( Kraut et al . 1988 ; Steinmo and Rasmussen 2016 ) . Other factors that have led to research collaboration include the interdisciplinary nature of many research projects as well as the increase in funding of research projects that involves more than one institu - tion ( Haeussler and Sauermann 2013 ) . This study seeks to find out if MIS researchers are collaborating within schools or across schools by answering the following questions : Q6a : What are the dominant number of schools of authors in MIS survey research ? Q6b : How diverse are the MIS journals in the number of schools of the authors ? Q6c : How representative of diversity are the Europe and USA based MIS journals in the number of schools of the authors ? Research methodology , data collection , analysis and results Methodology and data collection Since the primary objective of this study was to understand and measure diversity in the MIS field along various factors , research articles covering 21 years were gathered from 15 mainstream MIS journals . The articles were analyzed and classified into two groups with one group representing the articles published in journals domiciled in Europe while the other group represented journals domiciled in the USA as shown in Table 2 . The arti - cle selection process proceeded as follows : A full text of all the survey - based empirical research articles from these journals was obtained via the ABI / INFORM database , and a full review of the article was done with emphasis given to the author ( s ) page , keywords , methodology and , specifically , data collection sections . The journals and their respective survey - based articles that were selected for this study are shown in Table 2 . Although this list of journals is not a random sample and may not reflect the full spectrum of survey - based research in the MIS discipline , these journals are research - oriented , publish a high number of survey - based research articles , cover a wide spectrum of research topics in the MIS field , and are also reinforced by well - established research and publication policies . Additionally , these journals were selected because they were ranked among the top in MIS research by various researchers ( Walstrom et al . 1995 ; Hardgrave and Walstrom 1997 ; 1599 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 Lowry et al . 2004 ; Rainer and Miller 2005 ) and , thus reflect the mainstream practices and research trends adopted in the MIS field . Also , the researchers aimed to include the generic 8 Journals in the “MIS research Journal basket” namely MISQ , ISR , JMIS , JAIS , ISJ , JIT , JSIS , and EJIS . Even though the basket of 8 is considered the main repository for MIS research ( Stewart et al . 2017 ) , there are other outlets where MIS researchers publish their works such as I & M , SJIS , DS , MS , AM / IO , CAIS , and CACM which are also considered top journals for MIS research ( Hardgrave and Walstrom 1997 ; Zhang et al . 2009 ) . Although the full review of all the articles was time - consuming , it was necessary to ensure that some articles were not omitted due to oversight based on , for instance , the pro - cess of selecting articles based on keywords or the review of abstracts . Each article was read by two reviewers independently and coded accordingly . Eventually , the two reviewers compared their findings , and where disagreement arose , they reached a consensus . Over - all , the inter - rater reliability coefficients are shown in Table 3 . The values are above 79 % ( 0 . 79 ) and are indicative of acceptable agreement among the coders ( Cohen 1960 ; Neu - endorf 2002 ) . The inter - coder reliability values were also comparable to other studies that Table 2 Research journals sample space I & M , Information and Management ; EJIS , European Journal of Information Systems ; ISJ , Information Sys - tems Journa ; JSIS , Journal of Strategic Information Systems ; JIT , Journal of Information Technology ; AM / IO , Accounting , Management , and Information Technologies / Information and Organization ; MISQ , Man - agement Information Systems Quarterly ; JMIS , Journal of Management Information Systems ; ISR , Infor - mation Systems Research ; CACM , Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery ; MS , Management Sciences ; DS , Decision Sciences ; JIS , Journal of Information Systems ; JAIS , Journal of the Association for Information Systems ; CAIS , Communications of the Association for Information Systems Europe Journals Study period # of Articles USA Journals Study period # of Articles I & M 1990 – 2010 481 MISQ 1990 – 2010 121 EJIS 1991 – 2010 111 JMIS 1990 – 2010 157 ISJ 1997 – 2010 34 ISR 1990 – 2010 71 JSIS 1991 – 2010 54 CACM 1990 – 2010 84 JIT 1990 – 2010 68 MS 1990 – 2010 76 AM / IO 1991 – 2010 10 DS 1990 – 2010 128 JIS 2002 – 2010 32 JAIS 2002 – 2010 21 CAIS 2002 – 2010 18 Total 758 Total 708 Table 3 Inter - coder reliability Diver - sity factors Criteria ( factors ) Inter - coder reliability 1 Unit of analysis 82 % ( 0 . 82 ) 2 Types of respondents 88 % ( 0 . 88 ) 3 Number of authors 100 % ( 1 . 00 ) 4 Number of countries of the authors 100 % ( 1 . 00 ) 5 Number of schools of the authors 100 % ( 1 . 00 ) 6 Research topics 79 % ( 0 . 79 ) 1600 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 adopted a similar methodology such as Ford et al .

Analysis and results Descriptive statistics : dominant categories for factors in MIS survey research The data extraction and coding process yielded 1466 articles within the review period as shown in Table 2 . In this section , descriptive statistics provide data that answers the ques - tions of the dominant categories within both the research factors and the authorship factors . The following section gives a short synopsis of how data related to the six research factors under investigation namely units of analysis , research topics , type of respondents , number of authors , number of the country of authors , and number of schools of authors was col - lected and analyzed . Unit of analysis To identify the unit of analysis for each article , an examination of the relevant sections of the article such as the abstract , introduction , and the methodology section was done . Some of the common units of analysis were firm , individual , team , project , and systems . A sum - mary of the values by the individual journals as well as regional aggregate values are pre - sented in Table 4 . For instance , in the Europe ( EU ) journals , the two dominant categories in the factor , Unit of Analysis ( UOA ) , were firm ( 4 ) and individual ( 1 ) at 41 . 7 % and 39 . 6 % respectively , while in the USA journals , the dominant categories were firm and individual , albeit at a closer range at 45 . 2 % and 45 . 1 % respectively . When data from both regions were aggregated , the most dominant UOA was firm ( 4 ) at 43 . 4 % followed by the individual ( 1 ) at 42 . 2 % . Research topics One of the goals of this study was to evaluate the research topics in the survey - based research articles published in Europe ( EU ) and USA based journals to investigate the diversity of the research outputs in these two geographical regions . To classify the research within different topics , the authors started with the 45 topics used by ( Palvia et al . 2015 ) . Secondly , the authors classified the articles based on the keywords of those specific top - ics . To prepare the data for statistical analysis based on a reasonable number of topics , the authors aggregated the topics by collapsing them into categories . The ten categories were developed based on the findings and methodology used in prior MIS research ( Glass et al . 2002 , 2004 ; Vessey et al . 2002 ; Barki et al . 1988 ) . The resulting summary data with the specific topic titles is presented in Table 5 . A comprehensive listing of the various research topics and corresponding categories along with definitions and examples are contained in the appendix , while Table 5 shows a summary of the topics from the sampled journals . The top three categories in the topic fac - tor in the Europe ( EU ) journals are IS Management ( 5 ) at 20 . 1 % , IS adoption and Diffusion ( 6 ) at 19 . 5 % , and IS Implementation and Usage Operations ( 9 ) at 18 . 6 % , while in the USA journals they are IS Management ( 5 ) at 21 . 9 % , IS Implementations and Diffusion at 20 . 9 % and IS adoption and Diffusion ( 6 ) at 19 . 8 % . Overall , the most dominant category in the 1601 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 T a b l e 4 U n it o f a n a l y s i s i n E u r op e a nd U S A J ou r n a l s B o l d a nd it a li c s r e p r e s e n t t h e t op t w o do m i n a n t ca t e go r i e s f o r ea c h d i v e r s it y f ac t o r UO A un it o f a n a l y s i s 1 = I n d i v i du a l , 2 = T ea m s , 3 = P r o j ec t s , 4 = F i r m , 5 = F i r m dy a d / S upp l y c h a i n r / s h i p , 6 = S y s t e m s , 7 = C oun t r y / S o c i e t y E u r op e ( E U ) A m e r i ca n ( U S A ) UOA I & M E J I S I S J J S I S J I T A M / I O T o t a l E U M I S Q J M I S I S R C A C M M S D S J I S J A I S C A I S T o t a l U S A # % # % 1 208 39 14 14 19 6 300 39 . 6 63 63 29 72 14 34 14 17 13 319 45 . 1 2 10 6 5 3 1 1 26 3 . 4 3 3 4 1 6 2 3 0 0 22 3 . 1 3 23 3 5 0 6 1 38 5 . 0 4 9 0 1 5 3 4 1 0 27 3 . 8 4 192 51 5 32 34 2 316 41 . 7 48 76 36 10 49 84 10 3 4 320 45 . 2 5 9 1 0 2 0 0 12 1 . 6 2 5 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 15 2 . 1 6 36 11 5 2 8 0 62 8 . 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 4 0 . 6 7 3 0 0 1 0 0 4 0 . 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 . 1 T o t a l 481 111 34 54 68 10 758 100 212 157 71 84 76 128 32 21 18 708 100 1602 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 T a b l e 5 M a i n t op i c s s t ud i e d u s i ng s u r v e y b a s e d r e s ea r c h m e t hod i n E u r op e a nd U S A B o l d a nd it a li c s r e p r e s e n t t h e t op t w o do m i n a n t ca t e go r i e s f o r ea c h d i v e r s it y f ac t o r 1 = T ec hno l ogy a nd H a r d w a r e c on ce p t s , 2 = S y s t e m a nd s o f t w a r e C on ce p t s , 3 = D a t a a nd I n f o r m a ti on C on ce p t s , 4 = B u s i n e ss o f I T , 5 = I S M a n a g e m e n t , 6 = I S A dop ti on a nd D i ff u s i on , 7 = I S I m p li ca ti on s a nd S o c i e t y , 8 = I S E du ca ti on a nd R e s ea r c h , 9 = I S I m p l e m e n t a ti on a nd U s a g e op e r a ti on s , 10 = I S O r g a n i za ti on a l I m p ac t a nd v a l u e E u r o p e ( E U ) A m e r i ca n ( U S A ) T yp e o f t op i c s I & M E J I S I S J J S I S J I T A M / I O T o t a l E U M I S Q J M I S I S R C A C M M S D S J I S J A I S C A I S T o t a l U S A # % # % 1 2 2 0 1 3 0 8 1 . 1 1 1 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 9 1 . 3 2 51 13 6 3 6 2 81 10 . 7 9 16 3 5 17 8 3 1 0 62 8 . 8 3 16 10 0 2 0 0 28 3 . 7 11 4 3 11 0 0 1 1 0 31 4 . 4 4 69 11 9 4 10 1 104 13 . 7 3 6 8 19 0 6 4 4 4 54 7 . 6 5 90 21 7 16 14 4 152 20 . 1 30 41 20 15 12 22 8 6 1 155 21 . 9 6 111 18 1 6 11 1 148 19 . 5 39 32 16 6 15 22 2 6 2 140 19 . 8 7 22 3 4 6 6 2 43 5 . 7 2 7 1 6 3 6 3 2 2 32 4 . 5 8 10 3 2 1 1 0 17 2 . 2 4 7 1 13 2 8 2 0 5 42 5 . 9 9 91 25 5 10 10 0 141 18 . 6 17 29 12 5 18 53 9 1 4 148 20 . 9 10 19 5 0 5 7 0 36 4 . 7 5 14 4 1 8 3 0 0 0 35 4 . 9 T o t a l 481 111 34 54 68 10 758 100 121 157 71 84 76 128 32 2 1 18 708 100 1603 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 topic factor ( most studied topic ) was IS Management ( 5 ) at 20 . 9 % followed by IS Imple - mentation and Diffusion ( 9 ) at 19 . 7 % and IS adoption and Diffusion ( 6 ) at 19 . 6 % . Types of respondents As alluded to earlier , in a survey key elements of the research are the various respondents who provide feedback through the questionnaires by responding to the research questions , and thus provide the researchers with opportunities to better understand the phenomena under investigation . In this study , the “type of respondent” refers to the groups or individu - als who are targeted for solicitation during the survey research process . After analyzing the data , the main groups of respondents included IT Executives ( e . g . Chief Information Offic - ers , Chief Technology Officers , and senior IT Managers ) , Business Executives ( e . g . Chief Executive Officers , Chief Financial Officers , and Chief Operations Officers ) , IT Executives and Business Executives ( e . g . Chief Information / Technology Officers and Chief Executive / Financial / Operations Officers ) , IT Professionals ( e . g . systems / business analysts , program - mers / developers , systems architects and quality assurance analysts ) , Employees ( e . g . store superintendents , inventory clerks , order entry clerks , accountants ) , IT Users ( e . g . custom - ers , general public , web users , clients of m - commerce systems ) , and Students ( e . g . uni - versity students enrolled in business courses in both undergraduate and MBA programs ) , among others . For the most part , the researcher ( s ) explicitly stated who the target ( s ) or respondents were in the surveys . The distinct categories and their related values are repre - sented in Table 6 . There is a distinction between the IT executives’ category and the IT Executives and Business Executives category to indicate those surveys that specifically solicited input from the IT executives ( IT Executives ) only versus those that required both groups ( IT Executives and Business Executives ) to respond to the same survey . Also , the employee is coded as a distinct category to distinguish it from those surveys that target employees from those that target students . From the summary statistics in Table 6 , Business Executives ( 3 ) was the dominant group of respondents in EU journals at 26 . 4 % followed by IT execu - tives at 20 . 1 % while in USA journals , Business Executives ( 3 ) was the dominant group at 31 . 5 % followed by employees ( 5 ) at 21 . 9 % . When the data from both regions were aggre - gated , Business Executives ( 3 ) was the dominant type of respondent at 28 . 7 % followed by IT executives ( 1 ) at 20 . 5 % . Number of authors The factor , the number of authors , refer to the numerical number of authors listed in each manuscript . The factor is defined under several categories coded as 1 representing one author , 2 representing two authors , 3 representing three authors , etc . as shown in Table 7 . This study does not consider the order in which the authors are listed in the manuscript , a process that has been previously used to indicate the weight of each author’s contribu - tion . There were only three manuscripts with six authors , the highest value in this factor . The summary data in Table 7 shows that in the EU and USA journals , the most dominant category in the factor ( number of authors in a manuscript ) was two ( 2 ) which accounted for 42 . 5 % in the EU journals and 42 . 1 % in the USA journals . Additionally , in the EU jour - nals , the top two dominant categories ( two and three authors in a manuscript ) accounted for 71 . 6 % while in the USA manuscripts , the top two dominant categories ( two and three authors in a manuscript ) accounted for 76 . 5 % .

The factor was conceptualized as zero ( 0 ) to represent one country , two ( 2 ) to represent two countries , three ( 3 ) to represent three countries , etc . as shown in Table 8 . In both the EU and the USA regions , the majority of the articles were produced by authors in the same country , one country ( 0 ) representing 79 . 3 % and 81 . 4 % of the articles in the EU and USA respectively . After combining the data from both groups , the results revealed that 80 . 3 % of the articles were produced by authors from the same country ( 0 ) . On a side note , we also computed the percentage of articles that represented authors from both academia and industry , and not surprisingly , we found those numbers to be quite low with only 3 . 17 % in Europe , 2 . 68 % in the USA and 2 . 93 % overall . Number of schools of the authors To capture the number of schools of the authors in the research articles , the factor number of schools , was conceptualized , thus , zero ( 0 ) represents the same school , implying the authors came from one school , two ( 2 ) represents two different schools , and three ( 3 ) rep - resents three schools as shown in Table 9 . Based on the EU journals , the majority of the articles were written by authors from the same school , zero ( 0 ) representing 43 . 1 % while in the USA journals , most of the articles were written by authors from two different schools two ( 2 ) representing 45 . 6 % . The combined data from both regions indicated that most of the articles were authored by researchers from two different schools , two ( 2 ) representing 42 . 4 % of all the sampled articles . The summary descriptive statistics shown in Table 10 contain the results that answer the first section of each research question , namely , what are the dominant categories ( factor of interest e . g . unit of analysis ) in the MIS survey research ? Statistical analysis : diversity and representativeness in MIS survey research The following section reports on the diversity and representativeness of the MIS jour - nals . The section begins by briefly outlining how diversity was captured from the sampled research articles . Diversity and representativeness indices For a factor under consideration with k categories , let p 1 , … , p k be the observed propor - tions , p i = o i n , n = O 1 + ··· + … , O k , i = 1 … , k . In general , the diversity of the factor may be reflected by ( i ) the relative distribution of the p i ’s , and ( ii ) the number of categories . If two factors have the same relative distribution ( for example , both are evenly distributed ) , then the one with a higher number of categories will be more diverse than the other one . The value of k is important if we are interested in comparing diversity among factors , which we are not . Rather , we are interested in comparing diversity among journals .

Let P = ( p 1 , … , p k ) be the observed proportions for some factor . A natural and simple measure for the diversity of P is the Standard Deviation ( SD ) ( Vessey et al . 2002 ) . Let V be the ( usual ) variance of ( p 1 , … , p k ) , then V = 1 k − 1 �∑ ki = 1 p 2 i − 1 k � and SD = √ V . SD assumes its minimum value , which is 0 , if p 1 = ··· = p k = 1 k ( reflecting complete diversity ) and assumes its maximum value , which is 1 √ k , if we have a full concentration over one of the categories , that is , p i = 1 for some i . Thus , with SD , lower values are an indication of more diversity while higher values of SD are an indication of less diversity . Another measure of diversity is the Shannon entropy ( Shannon 1948 ) which is given by E 1 = − ∑ ki = 1 p i log p i . This diversity measure has been previously applied in other research studies ( Sudhindra et al . 2017 ) . E 1 assumes its maximum value of log k when p 1 = ··· = p k = 1 k , reflecting complete diversity and assumes its minimum value of zero ( 0 ) if we have a full concentration over one of the categories . Thus , higher values of E 1 are an indication of more diversity , while lower values of E 1 are an indication of less diversity . There is another entropy measure referred to as the Tsallis entropy ( Tsallis 1988 ) which is given by E 2 = 1 − ∑ ki = 1 p 2 i . Tsallis entropy is also known as the Simpson diversity index ( Simpson 1949 ) and has been used previously by Wang et al . ( 2017 ) . Tsallis entropy has the following interpretation : Consider a population with probability distribution 𝜋 1 … , 𝜋 k , over k categories . Then , sampling with replacement , E 2 is the probability of selecting two individuals from this population that are from two distinct categories . E 2 assumes its mini - mum value of zero ( 0 ) if the distribution is concentrated on one category ( π i = 1 for some i ) , indicating no diversity and assumes its maximum value of 1 − 1 k , when 𝜋 1 = ⋯ 𝜋 k = 1 k , indicating complete diversity . We note that , V and E 2 are related as follows : V = 1 − K K − 1 E 2 , hence SD , V and E 2 are comparable . Accordingly , we select E 2 which is mathematically analogous to SD . There is an additional class of measures for diversity that is based on the notion of divergence . For this class , we consider the null hypothesis : H 0 ∶ 𝜋 1 = ⋯ 𝜋 k = 1 k . That is , the population under consideration exhibits complete diversity ( here , 𝜋 i is the probability of observing category i and H a : at least one 𝜋 i ≠ 1 k ) . If we let e i = n k be the expected fre - quency of category i under H 0 , then we have the following two measures : 1 . The likelihood ratio test statistic : G 2 = 2 n ∑ ki = 1 p i log ( kp i ) , and 2 . The Pearson’s Chi - Square ( χ 2 ) statistic : 𝜒 2 = ∑ ki = 1 ( o i − e i ) 2 e i . We note that χ 2 relates to E 2 ( and SD , V ) , while G 2 relates to E 1 . Accordingly , we will use χ 2 and E 2 as our indices in evaluating diversity and representativeness . Measuring diversity The measures of diversity from each factor are given as a set of frequencies over several categories . For a given factor , let ( O 1 , O 2 , O 3 … , O k ) be the observed frequencies over k categories , where O i is the observed frequency for category i , i = 1 , … , k . Intuitively , if all frequencies are equal ( or almost equal ) , then the factor exhibits a complete diversity . On the other hand , if all the frequencies are concentrated over one category , then the factor exhibits the other extreme , namely no diversity at all . Looking at Table 11 , which provides the number of categories for each factor , we can infer that the factors are not concentrated 1611 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 over one category and that we are far from complete diversity . For instance , in the factor , # number of the country of authors with five categories , only one journal ( I & M ) has entries in all the categories . Also , in the factor , the number of authors with six categories , only three journals ( EJIS , JMIS , and CACM ) have entries in all the six categories . Accordingly , the focus of this study is on the relative degree of diversity exhibited by each journal for each factor . Diversity for individual factors Based on the earlier explanation on how to compute diversity indices ( χ 2 and E 2 ) , Table 12 shows the relationships between the χ 2 values and levels . The χ 2 values are organized in three levels : level 1 represents values of Chi - Square with p - values less than 0 . 01 , level 2 Table 11 Number of categories present in each factor under investigation I & M , Information and Management ; EJIS , European Journal of Information Systems ; ISJ , Information Sys - tems Journal ; JSIS , Journal of Strategic Information Systems ; JIT , Journal of Information Technology ; AM / IO , Accounting , Management , and Information Technologies / Information and Organization ; EU , Europe ; USA , American ; MISQ , Management Information Systems Quarterly ; JMIS , Journal of Management Infor - mation Systems ; ISR , Information Systems Research ; CACM , Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery ; MS , Management Sciences ; DS , Decision Sciences ; JIS , Journal of Information Systems ; JAIS , Journal of the Association for Information Systems ; CAIS , Communications of the Associa - tion for Information Systems Numeric values represent the unique number of attributes in each category for the journals a Number of unique categories in each factor # Journal Unit of analysis Research topics Types of respondents # of Authors # of Country of Authors # of Schools of Authors EU 1 I & M 7 10 7 5 5 4 2 EJIS 7 10 7 6 4 5 3 ISJ 6 7 7 4 3 5 4 JSIS 6 10 7 4 4 3 5 JIT 6 10 7 5 3 4 6 AM / IO 5 5 6 3 2 2 USA 7 MISQ 7 10 7 4 4 4 8 JMIS 6 10 6 6 4 4 9 ISR 4 10 6 4 2 4 10 CACM 4 10 6 6 4 4 11 MS 5 8 5 4 2 4 12 DS 6 8 5 4 4 4 13 JIS 6 8 5 4 3 4 14 JAIS 3 7 5 4 4 3 15 CAIS 3 6 4 4 2 4 16 EU 7 10 7 6 4 4 17 USA 7 10 7 6 5 4 18 Total a 7 10 7 6 5 4 1612 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 represents those with p - values between 0 . 01 and 0 . 05 , while level 3 represents those with p - values greater than 0 . 05 . For example , for the factor , “ # of Authors” with 5 categories and hence 4 degrees of freedom , the χ 2 values as shown in Table 13 are 267 , 58 , 17 , 39 , 50 , and 11 for the six Europe ( EU ) journals . Five of these χ 2 values ( 267 , 58 , 17 , 39 , 50 ) are greater than 13 . 28 , and hence are placed in level 1 . One value ( 11 ) is greater than 9 . 49 but less than 13 . 28 , which places it in level 2 according to the entries in Table 12 . Conversely , Table 13 provides for each journal the values of χ 2 and E 2 along with their ranks . The ranking rules are thus , the highest value of χ 2 is ranked as one ( 1 ) ( the lowest rank ) denoting it as the least diverse in the group while the E 2 lowest value receives a rank of one ( 1 ) which indicates it as the least diverse in the group . Also , in the ranks , ties are represented by averages . Thus , lower - ranked journals are least diverse in each fac - tor under investigation and vice versa . The information in Table 13 can be summarized using the Chi - Square value ( and its corresponding p value ) as a descriptive measure of divergence from the uniform distribution over categories ( the case of maximum diversity ) based on the entries in Table 12 . Table 14 shows the summary groupings according to the levels depicted in Table 12 and the values in Table 13 . As stated earlier , for the factor , # of authors , ( with 5 categories ) five Europe journals ( EU1 ) , namely I & M ( χ 2 = 267 ) , EJIS ( χ 2 = 58 ) , ISJ ( χ 2 = 17 ) , JSIS ( χ 2 = 39 ) , and JIT ( χ 2 = 50 ) , are in level 1 because their χ 2 val - ues are greater than 13 . 28 while AM / IO ( χ 2 = 11 ) and SJIS ( χ 2 = 10 ) are in level 2 ( EU2 ) because their respective χ 2 values are between 9 . 49 and 13 . 28 . Measuring representativeness In the current study , the concept of representation deals with the similarity of the distribu - tion of a certain factor for a certain journal with fixed distribution , that may be considered as a representative for the entire set . For this study , we consider the combined distribution ( all 15 journals ) as our base for comparison and use some measure of distance between this combined distribution and the observed distribution for each journal . One natural measure for the distance is χ 2 . For a given factor , let P = ( P 1 , … P k ) be the ( combined ) proportions for this factor and p = ( p 1 , … , p k ) be the distribution of a certain journal under considera - tion , then , we can compute the usual χ 2 , providing a measure of distance between P and p . Table 14 provides the results . In interpreting the results , we use the p - value as a measure of how far away p is from P ( Note : We are not testing hypotheses here , we are merely try - ing to figure out how far away p is from P in a descriptive sense ) . In that sense , we use the three levels mentioned earlier and presented in Table 12 summary classification with Level Table 12 Placement of Chi - Square values into levels based on p values 1613 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 T a b l e 13 S u mm a r y S t a t i s ti c s f o r C h i - s qu a r e ( χ 2 ) , T s a lli s e n t r opy ( E 2 ) , a nd c o rr e s pond i ng r a nk s χ 2 C h i - s qu a r e , R k r a nk , E 2 T s a lli s e n t r opy E U : E u r op e J ou r n a l s C o m b i n e d , U S A : A m e r i ca n J ou r n a l s C o m b i n e d , A LL : B o t h E U a nd U S A T h e r a nk r u l e s a r e t hu s 1 d e no t e s t h e l o w e s t r a nk 15 d e no t e s h i g h e s t r a nk J ou r n a l # o f A u t ho r s # o f S c hoo l s o f a u t ho r s U n it o f a n a l y s i s T yp e s o f r e s pond e n t s # o f t h e C oun t r y o f a u t ho r s R e s ea r c h t op i c s χ 2 R k E 2 R k χ 2 R k E 2 R k χ 2 R k E 2 R k χ 2 R k E 2 R k χ 2 R k E 2 R k χ 2 R k E 2 R k 1 I & M 267 1 0 . 69 9 . 5 231 2 0 . 63 9 549 1 0 . 64 11 88 4 0 . 83 15 515 1 0 . 31 5 294 1 0 . 84 12 2 E J I S 58 6 0 . 70 11 . 5 42 6 0 . 65 1 2 121 7 0 . 65 12 . 5 45 9 0 . 80 14 . 5 86 7 0 . 41 12 54 7 0 . 85 13 3 I S J 17 11 0 . 70 11 . 5 12 11 0 . 66 13 . 5 18 14 0 . 74 15 14 14 0 . 80 14 . 5 24 11 0 . 43 1 4 28 10 0 . 82 7 . 5 4 J S I S 39 9 0 . 66 5 25 10 0 . 63 9 87 9 0 . 56 10 47 8 0 . 73 3 49 10 0 . 36 11 36 9 0 . 83 10 . 5 5 J I T 50 7 0 . 65 4 47 5 0 . 58 3 75 10 0 . 65 4 37 10 0 . 78 12 68 9 0 . 33 7 27 11 0 . 86 14 . 5 6 A M / I O 11 13 0 . 58 1 10 14 . 5 0 . 50 2 15 15 0 . 58 9 5 15 0 . 78 12 10 14 0 . 32 6 16 15 0 . 74 1 7 M I S Q 110 2 0 . 62 2 . 5 76 3 0 . 59 4 192 5 0 . 57 7 . 5 63 5 0 . 78 12 113 4 0 . 35 9 . 5 124 3 0 . 80 4 . 5 8 J M I S 99 3 0 . 67 6 . 5 293 1 0 . 28 1 220 4 0 . 60 10 124 3 0 . 75 11 181 2 0 . 28 3 . 5 107 4 0 . 83 10 . 5 9 I S R 64 5 0 . 62 2 . 5 42 7 0 . 60 5 111 8 0 . 57 7 . 5 51 6 0 . 76 9 99 6 0 . 20 1 57 6 0 . 82 7 10 C A C M 46 8 0 . 69 9 . 5 48 4 0 . 61 6 . 5 294 2 0 . 25 1 50 7 0 . 77 10 101 5 0 . 27 2 36 8 0 . 86 14 . 5 11 M S 34 10 0 . 71 13 32 9 0 . 64 11 134 6 0 . 54 5 155 2 0 . 56 1 73 8 0 . 35 9 . 5 63 5 0 . 82 7 . 5 12 D S 84 4 0 . 67 6 . 5 36 8 0 . 68 1 5 262 3 0 . 49 4 163 1 0 . 68 2 137 3 0 . 34 8 183 2 0 . 76 2 13 J I S 10 14 0 . 74 15 11 12 0 . 66 13 . 5 28 13 0 . 69 14 21 11 0 . 76 7 24 12 0 . 42 1 3 27 12 0 . 82 7 . 5 14 J A I S 13 12 0 . 68 8 10 13 0 . 63 9 64 11 0 . 32 2 16 13 0 . 76 7 8 15 0 . 54 1 5 24 13 0 . 79 3 15 C A I S 7 15 0 . 72 14 10 14 . 5 0 . 61 6 . 5 48 12 0 . 36 3 15 12 0 . 74 4 21 13 0 . 28 3 . 5 19 14 0 . 80 4 . 5 E U 410 0 . 69 351 0 . 63 802 0 . 66 170 0 . 83 749 0 . 34 384 0 . 85 U S 430 0 . 68 335 0 . 63 1042 0 . 59 396 0 . 78 746 0 . 32 384 0 . 85 A L L 825 0 . 69 684 0 . 63 1820 0 . 63 460 0 . 81 1494 0 . 33 744 0 . 85 1614 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 1 ( larger χ 2 values , lower ranks ) indicating least representativeness , and Level 3 ( smaller χ 2 values , larger ranks ) indicating the most representativeness . Table 15 provides the Chi - Square values and their corresponding ranks , while Table 16 presents the summary classi - fication based on the three levels outlined earlier . For instance , for the factor , # of Authors , ( with 5 categories , and hence 4 degrees of freedom ) five ( 5 ) Europe journals ( EU3 ) namely EJIS ( χ 2 = 8 . 07 ) , ISJ ( χ 2 = 1 . 7 ) , JSIS ( χ 2 = 3 . 68 ) , JIT ( χ 2 = 3 . 78 ) , and AM / IO ( χ 2 = 6 . 88 ) are in level 3 because their χ 2 values are less than 9 . 49 , while I & M ( χ 2 = 11 . 22 ) is in level 2 ( EU2 ) as shown in Table 16 . Representativeness for individual factors The measure of representativeness depicts how publications in one journal , hence , the fac - tors in the current study , mirror the publications in the discipline . Based on the χ 2 values , higher χ 2 values get a lower rank ( Level 1 ) and depict the least representativeness met - rics and vice versa as shown in Table 15 . For the factor , # of authors , ISJ ( χ 2 = 1 . 70 and Rk = 15 ) is the most representative because its distribution is the closest to the overall dis - tribution—for the 15 journals in the sample . The least representative journal in the fac - tor , # of authors is the JAIS ( χ 2 = 13 . 47 , Rk = 1 ) . On aggregate , in the Europe group , most of the journals were representative as indicated by the EU 3 values and only one journal ( I & M ) was classified in level 2 ( EU 2 ) implying that this journal was somehow representa - tive in the # of authors factor . Additionally , in the USA group , most of the journals were representative except for JAIS and DS which were in USA 1 and USA 2 groups respec - tively . The factor , “ # of authors” , has five categories namely one author , two authors , three authors , etc . Most of the manuscripts reviewed in the journals in the current study did not have an even distribution ( read diverse ) the number of authors in each of these categories but were concentrated in the two and three authors categories . On the factor , # of schools of authors , the most representative journal overall was JIS ( χ 2 = 1 . 57 and Rk = 15 ) which is in the USA group , while in the Europe group , the most representative journal was I & M ( χ 2 = 1 . 91 and Rk = 14 ) . Overall , as shown in Table 16 , Table 14 Summary data showing groupings by levels of diversity Level 1 : p value < 0 . 01 ; Level 2 : p value between 0 . 01 a 0 . 05 ; Level 3 : p value > 0 . 05 EU 1 = Europe Level 1 , EU 2 = Europe Level 2 , EU 3 = Europe Level 3 USA 1 = American Level 1 , USA 2 = American Level 2 , USA 3 = American Level 3 TOT 1 = Total Level 1 , TOT 2 = Total Level 2 , TOT 3 = Total Level 3 Journal groups # of Authors # of Schools of Authors Unit of analysis # of Country of authors Types of respondents Research topics EU 1 5 5 5 6 4 5 EU 2 1 1 1 0 1 0 EU 3 0 0 0 0 1 1 USA 1 6 6 9 8 7 8 USA 2 3 3 0 1 2 1 USA 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 TOT 1 11 11 14 14 11 13 TOT 2 4 4 1 1 3 1 TOT 3 0 0 0 0 1 1 1615 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 all journals in the Europe group were classified under EU 3 , while for the USA journals , they were evenly divided into the three groups USA 1 , USA 2 , and USA 3 . For the factor , unit of analysis , the most representative journal is AM / IO ( χ 2 = 4 . 73 and Rk = 15 ) , and the second most representative journal is MISQ ( χ 2 = 7 . 35 and Rk = 14 ) . In both groups , three journals in each group were classified under the level 1 namely EU 1 and USA 1 and one journal in each group under level 2 , ( EU 2 and USA 2 ) , and two journals in ( EU 3 ) and five journals in USA 3 respectively . The factor , unit of analysis , has seven categories and out of the 15 journals reviewed in this study , only three journals reported values in all the seven categories . The country of authors indicates the number of countries in which the authors are domiciled . Overall , the most representative journal was DS ( χ 2 = 0 . 08 and Rk = 15 ) which is in the USA group while in the Europe group , the most representative journal was JIT ( χ 2 = 0 . 10 and Rk = 14 ) .

The factor , the number of country of authors , had three levels depicting one country , two countries , and three or more countries , while an overwhelming major - ity of the articles in this study were dominated by authors from the one country category . Table 16 illustrates this phenomenon by indicating that 13 journals were classified under the TOT 3 category , for the factor the number of country of authors , which shows that 13 of these journals had a distribution that was very close to the overall distribution ( 15 jour - nals ) and hence were representative . The type of respondent was conceptualized into seven groupings and out of the 15 jour - nals , only six journals had entries in each of the seven categories . Specifically , there were two journals in level 1 in Europe ( EU 1 ) 1 journal in level 2 ( EU 2 ) and three journals in level 3 ( EU 3 ) while in the USA , there were seven journals in level 1 ( USA 1 ) , no journal in level 2 ( USA 2 ) , and two journals in level 3 ( USA 3 ) . Finally , research topics were repre - sented thus : one journal in level 1 ( EU 1 ) , two journals in level 2 , ( EU 2 ) and three journals in level 3 ( EU 3 ) , while there were five journals in level 1 in the USA journals ( USA 1 ) and four journals in level 3 ( USA 3 ) . A summary of most and least representative journals for each factor is presented in Table 17 . Discussion The current study provides insight into the diversity and representative paradigm in the MIS research based on an analysis of the survey - based research articles published in 15 mainstream MIS journals in Europe and the USA over 21 years . Towards this end , the paper uses six factors to study diversity and representative , namely unit of analysis , research topics , type of respondents , number of authors , number of schools of authors , and number of the country of authors . The following section addresses each of the aforemen - tioned factors .

Thus , in studying MIS artifacts , MIS survey research is more geared towards understanding the implications of technologies as it pertains to firms and individuals . Firm and individual are among the units of analysis articulated by Sekaran and Bougie ( 2016 ) . The results on the firm and individual unit of analysis also infer that MIS survey researchers are conducting most of their research at the behavioral level ( Glass et al . 2004 ) . The fact that the dominant catego - ries in the UoA are firm and individual in the MIS survey articles analyzed in this research is commensurate with the interaction of humans and technology in solving day to day busi - ness and societal issues . Surprisingly , based on the results , the use of teams as a UoA in survey research is not prevalent in Europe . On the other hand , in the factor # of authors , the dominant category is two and three authors in positions 1 and 2 respectively in Europe , USA , and overall . Conversely , most of the articles used in this study were written by two authors . The value of co - authorship is well noted as it leads to access to resources and a shared workload , among other ben - efits ( Acedo et al . 2006 ) . There is evidence indicative of the fact that incidences of co - authorship are on the rise ( Harzing 2013 ; Everard et al . 2017 ) and the results in the current study are in line with these prior studies . For instance , Harzing ( 2013 ) reported that in early 2010 , MISQ papers were written by 2 . 61 authors , while ISR and JMIS were written by 2 . 68 and 2 . 98 authors respectively . These numbers were significantly higher than those reported a decade earlier . We would have expected to see higher co - authorship values due to the nature of survey - based research which requires more resources compared to abstract or conceptual research undertakings . When it comes to the issue of the type of respondents , MIS researchers are using busi - ness executives to investigate the MIS phenomenon , both in Europe and the USA . The use of business executives is indicative of the fact that MIS survey - based research is relying on higher - level executives as key informants which may imply that MIS researchers are more focused on the managerial aspects of MIS applications in organizational settings . Although business executives provide rich survey data , it is becoming more challenging to obtain significant sample sizes from this group and there has been a noted decline in the response rates with reported values in the 10 – 20 % range ( Karanja and Zaveri 2013 ) . The factor # of the country of authors was dominated by authors from one country alluding to the fact that local social networks dominate co - authorships . The choice of local authorship may be partly driven by the need to alleviate the “coordination costs” ( Tompkins et al . 1997 ) associated with co - authorship which is a leading challenge in co - authorship endeavors and maybe amplified when authors are in different geographical locations . The factor , # of schools of authors was dominated by authors from one school in Europe , authors from two schools in the USA and authors from two schools overall . The domina - tion of authors from two schools in the USA may be attributed to the need for researchers to gain valuable resources or because of the established academic ties between mentors and mentees during the doctoral degree process . The most dominant research topic in Europe , the USA , and overall was IS management . In Europe , the second most researched topic was IS adoption and diffusion , while in the USA and overall , the second most researched topic was IS implementation and Usage operations . IS Management and IS usage and adoption were among the most popular research topics reported by Palvia et al . ( 2015 ) . The domi - nation of the research topic factor by the IS management topic is in line with the use of 1619 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 business executives as the key informants in studying the MIS phenomenon as represented by the type of respondents in this research . The proliferation and embeddedness nature of MIS in many organization spheres calls for a better understanding of MIS management , implementation / adoption , and usage . Diversity rankings across each factor In representing diversity , lower values of χ 2 , thus higher ranks depict higher diversity met - rics . So then , as illustrated in Table 14 , journals in the EU 3 , USA 3 , and ToT 3 group - ing would be considered the most diverse in the respective factor . Based on the results in Tables 12 and 13 , in Europe , only one journal , namely AM / IO is in the level 3 category ( EU 3 ) for the factors , type of respondents , and research topics , and therefore , exhibits some diversity in these factors . On the other hand , in the USA no journal is classified under the USA 3 group implying no diversity in the factors under investigation . For the other journals , there was no diversity in the factors under investigation as shown in Table 14 . In Europe , there is one journal exhibiting some diversity in the unit of analysis factor namely AM / IO while in the USA , none of the journals exhibited any diversity in the unit of analy - sis . Overall , AM / IO is the most diverse journal in the type of respondent’s factor while ISJ exhibits some diversity . In the USA , two journals exhibit some diversity in the type of respondents namely JAIS and CAIS while the rest of the journals in both groups show no diversity in this factor . The results reveal that survey - based manuscripts published in the AM / IO and to some extent in the JAIS and CAIS are utilizing a varied selection of key informants in studying MIS phenomenon . Lack of diversity in the type of respondents may be indicative of a bigger issue—that there is not enough diversity in the type of research questions we are addressing as a field . Only JAIS exhibits some diversity in the factor number of the country of authors . The lack of diversity in the country of authors may imply that co - authorship is taking place within geographical regions confirming the earlier findings from Galliers and Meadows ( 2003 ) who analyzed the major journals in the USA and compared their research output to those in Europe and found that USA domiciled journals tended to publish research from authors working in USA institutions and vice versa for the Europe domiciled journals . With the role that MIS plays in the global economy , we would expect more collaboration across geographical regions or economic blocks as MIS researchers seek to investigate how MIS concepts are manifest in different environments . Overall , the journals that show some inclinations toward diversity are also the ones that have a limited number of articles that were sampled as shown in Table 2 , leading us to conclude that for the factors under investi - gation , there is no conclusive evidence of diversity . Contributions and implications Contributions In this study , diversity is conceptualized through several factors that are easily identifia - ble in a survey - based research article , namely the unit of analysis , research topics , type of respondents , number of authors , number of schools of authors , and number of the coun - try of authors . The authorship factors , namely the number of authors , the number of the 1620 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 country of authors , and the number of schools of authors were included because there has been a reported increase in the co - authorship literature and an increased interest in what drives co - authorships . The use of the unit of analysis and the type of respondents was informed by the need to understand the level at which MIS researchers are investigating the MIS phenomenon and from whom they are getting their data ( evidence ) . The current study makes several contributions . To start with , the study presents an over - view of the state of the MIS survey - based research in terms of the unit of analysis , research topics , type of respondents , and authorship factors commonly adopted by researchers and thus makes available information to guide new scholars ( doctoral students who are the future of the discipline ) as well as the new and existing faculty researchers who are inter - ested in pursuing this stream of research . The current study adopts some core elements rec - ommended in content analysis research studies such as the use of complete articles during coding instead of keywords or abstracts to ensure that some articles were not omitted based only on the process of selecting articles based on key words or the review of abstracts . The study also makes use of multiple coders and Cohen’s kappa to access reliability and mini - mize chance agreement as well as lay the groundwork for replication studies ( Baker 2016 ) , a best practice in confirming and propagating scientific evidence and knowledge . Secondly , the results from this study provide insight into whether MIS survey research is diverse based on the unit of analysis , research topics , and type of respondents and thus sheds more light on the understanding of the elusive diversification phenomenon in the MIS field ( Vessey et al . 2002 ) . Some of the arguments for promoting diversity in the MIS research are grounded on the premise that a more diverse research environment expands the foundations on which claims in MIS are based and lends more credibility to the research findings ( Mingers 2001 ) . Also , drawing good researchers from diverse academic and industry backgrounds ( Hardaway et al . 2016 ) to study the MIS phenomenon using dif - ferent theoretical lenses creates diversity which can enrich the MIS discipline through the incorporation of diverse viewpoints and insights . By understanding the state of diversity in the MIS field , the discipline will nurture creativity and innovativeness especially in the units of analysis , research topics , types of respondents , and co - authorship while simultane - ously propagating the concept of academic freedom and thinking outside the box ( Robey 1996 ) . Furthermore , by comparing the results of the studies published in Europe to those stud - ies published in the USA , the researchers provide a platform to analyze how diversity is manifested for each of the factors in these regions and whether MIS scholars are moving together or whether there are significant differences between these regions . The choice of the two regions was driven by the prior MIS studies that have reported that most of the MIS research journals are domiciled in these two regions ( Hardgrave and Walstrom 1997 ; Galliers and Meadows 2003 ; Zhang et al . 2009 ) and that there are salient differences and similarities in the research outputs ( Evaristo and Karahanna 1997 ) . The inclusion of other regions ( e . g . Asia and Africa ) are deferred to a future study . The study also builds on prior research by creating new topic categories that incorporate many new topics relevant to the current context that were not part of earlier research . To make the data associated with the factor , type of research topic , manageable , the authors grouped all of the IS research into ten key categories based on prior work on diversity in the MIS field . In doing so , the authors identified new and emerging trends in the MIS field . These trends shed light on the current state of MIS survey research and not only encour - ages researchers towards addressing novel questions about new and emerging topics but also informs the field towards the future direction that these trends point to . A study of both Europe and USA based journals reveals focus on three key areas of research . They are 1621 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 IS Management , IS adoption and diffusion and , IS implementation and Usage operations . Not surprisingly , the most dominant research topic in MIS research both in Europe and the USA continues to be IS Management . The second most studied topic in Europe is IS adop - tion and diffusion followed by IS implementation and usage operations . The second most studied topic in USA journals is IS implementation and usage operations followed by IS adoption and diffusion . Implications for MIS research This study extends the debate and hence the study on diversity in the MIS discipline by incorporating other factors of diversity not explored in prior studies ( Benbasat and Weber 1996 ; Vessey et al . 2002 ; Robey 1996 ) , namely , type of respondents , number of schools of authors , number of authors , and number of country of authors . The results reveal a lack of diversity both at the individual journal level as well as in the groupings ( Europe and USA ) . Based on the analysis of the survey - based research articles in this study , there seems to be a lack of diversity in the field . For example , we find that for the factor unit of analysis , firm and individual levels are the dominant groupings at the expense of inter - organizational / firm - dyad , projects and country / society . Given the nature of the MIS field as a dynamic and constantly evolving discipline , the authors expected the results from the analyzed data to be diverse and reflect a balance on the units of analysis adopted by the researchers . The lack of diversity on the unit of analysis , research topics , and types of respondents may be intertwined in that most of the MIS research addresses organizational issues where a limited number of key informants are the respondents . As such , MIS researchers should seek to extend the repertoire of their research by exploring other MIS artefacts especially in light of the latest developments in the Internet of Things ( Joseph et al . 2017 ) , social net - working , Bring Your Own Devices , and cloud computing ( Senyo et al . 2018 ) which seems to be shifting the balance from the firm to the systems and users . The lack of diversity on the research topics may be attributed to the fact that the reviewed journals are the premier MIS outlets with established editorial policies and outlined preferred research inputs . Without discounting the acceptance of innovative research , it might be the case that due to the need to gain tenure or career advance - ments ( Haj - Bolouri and Flensburg 2017 ) , many MIS scholars choose to confine their research to the established guidelines to minimize rejection rates . Survey research is a resource - intensive endeavor , and as such , there was an expectation of more author collaborations in the survey - based manuscript above the two authors that dominated both regions . Through author collaborations , MIS researchers can ( and do ) enrich the research output and ultimately the field by incorporating different theories , perspectives , and knowledge ( Pries - Heje 2017 ) from their respective domains and thus yield insight - ful findings . Also , the MIS field is very dynamic , and as such MIS researchers should engage each other and share the workload of keeping up with the rapid changes in tech - nology . Unlike other disciplines , MIS scholars are confronted by the need to keep up with the changes in technologies , both in the classroom as well as while conducting research ( Benamati and Lederer 2001 ) . Given that the current study presents an overview of the state of the MIS survey - based research , the results of this study can guide future researchers in deciding what type of research to pursue and what type of unit of analysis to use in their studies . For instance , the results from the research topics highlight the most and least researched areas as well as the associated journals , and this information can assist researchers when 1622 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 deciding what to research and where to publish their research output and vice versa . The most dominant research topic in Europe , the USA , and overall was IS management . In Europe , the second most researched topic was IS adoption and diffusion while in the USA and overall , the second most researched topic was IS implementation and Usage operations . IS Management , and IS usage and adoption were among the most popular research topics reported by Palvia et al . ( 2015 ) . In response to the call for diversity in the MIS research methods , this study adopted the use of Tsallis Entropy and Chi - Square statistics to empirically measure diversity and representativeness . The authors hope that the current study has inspired research - ers to adopt these statistical techniques in evaluating other dimensions of diversity . As such , to enhance diversity through innovative research and expand the repertoire of MIS research , journals should encourage innovative research as well as continue with the established policies of special issues that tend to address out of the mainstream research areas . Through collaboration with researchers in other disciplines , MIS researchers can enrich the discipline by incorporating different theories , perspectives , and knowledge from these disciplines into the MIS research questions and thereby yield insightful find - ings . Of course , all these strategies should be taken with care to maintain a core in the MIS research since too much diversity might make MIS too broad to a point of losing relevance . On the other hand , a limited core that is dominated by a few variables will confine MIS researchers to what Benbasat and Weber ( 1996 ) called controlled diversity . Implications for industry and practice The results of this study also inform the practitioner community of the focus and direction in which the current MIS research is headed and calls for greater participation and collabo - ration on both sides . The results reveal that the academic / industry collaboration is almost non - existent with numbers between 2 and 3 % for all the published articles . MIS discipline is a very dynamic field and as such MIS researchers should engage the practitioners in the industry ( Hardaway et al . 2016 ) who are directly impacted by the rapid changes in technol - ogy . Unlike some academic disciplines , MIS scholars are confronted by the need to keep up with the changes in technologies ( Benamati and Lederer 2001 ) and their impact in the business world . Engaging with practitioners will be very useful for the MIS researchers in knowing first - hand the trends and challenges that industry is facing and help engage in research in new areas and topics that have not yet been addressed by the discipline . For the IS practitioners it will be useful to know the findings of MIS research and help make them informed decisions about various aspects of technology that have been studied by the researchers . Limitations and future studies The study makes use of 15 journals published in Europe and the USA . The journals were not selected randomly and hence may not reflect the full spectrum of survey - based research in the MIS discipline . However , these journals were selected because they were ranked among the top in MIS research by various researchers ( Walstrom et al . 1995 ; Hardgrave and Walstrom 1997 ; Lowry et al . 2004 ; Rainer and Miller 2005 ) and reflect the main - stream topics and research methods used in the MIS discipline . The researchers also aimed at including the generic 8 Journals in the “MIS research Journal basket” namely MISQ , ISR , JMIS , JAIS , ISJ , JIT , JSIS , and EJIS . Additionally , the sampled journals are 1623 Scientometrics ( 2020 ) 122 : 1583 – 1628 1 3 research - oriented , publish a high number of survey - based research articles , cover a wide spectrum of research topics in the MIS field , and are also reinforced by well - established research and publication policies . Future studies should seek to expand the pool of journals especially from other parts of the world such as Australia , Asia , and Africa . The publication starting date for the articles in the selected journals was chosen as January 1990 and the end date was December 2010 ; this period is much broader when compared to the periods used by other prior MIS researchers in investigating this kind of research phenomenon ( Chua et al . 2002 ) . The sample is not current but it is based on arti - cles published in 21 years of relevant and mainstream MIS Research journals and hence gives a good indication of the direction which MIS research has taken in a two - decade period and makes a significant contribution in that respect . However , future studies should seek to extrapolate this period to reflect the currency in this line of inquiry . The articles selected for use in the current study used a survey as the data collection method . As such , the results may be biased towards one research method . However , the survey research method accounts for over 40 % of published MIS published work making it the dominant empirical research method in the MIS field ( Kim et al . 2010 ; Orlikowski and Baroudi 1991 ) . Nevertheless , future studies should seek to explore articles using different research techniques such as case studies , lab experiments , and time - series studies .
