Upon 3 analyzing amino acid ( aa ) sequences of Dad2 , a Dam1 complex subunit , we identified a conserved 10 - aa - 4 long Dad2 signature sequence ( DSS ) . An arginine residue ( R126 ) in the DSS is essential for viability in 5 Saccharomyces cerevisiae that possesses point centromeres . The corresponding arginine residues are 6 functionally important but not essential for viability in Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans , 7 both carry several kilobases long regional centromeres . The purified recombinant Dam1 complex 8 containing either Dad2 ΔDSS or Dad2 R126A failed to bind microtubules ( MTs ) or form any visible rings like 9 the wild - type complex . Intriguingly , functional analysis revealed that the requirement of the conserved 10 arginine residue for chromosome biorientation and mitotic progression reduced with increasing centromere 11 length . We propose that plasticity of the invariant arginine of Dad2 in organisms with regional centromeres 12 is achieved by conditional elevation of the kinetochore protein ( s ) to enable multiple kinetochore MTs 13 ( kMTs ) to bind to each chromosome . The capacity of a chromosome to bind multiple kMTs may mask 14 deleterious effects of such lethal mutations . 15 3 Introduction 1 Accurate segregation of duplicated genetic material requires dynamic and regulated attachment of 2 the sister chromatids to spindle microtubules ( MTs ) . This association is mediated by the kinetochore , a 3 multiprotein complex that assembles on the centromeric locus on every chromosome ( Cheeseman 2014 ) . 4 The centromere - specific histone H3 variant , CENPA ( Cse4 in yeast ) , is a hallmark of functional 5 centromeres and acts as the foundation for assembling other kinetochore proteins in most organisms 6 ( Cheeseman 2014 ; Musacchio and Desai 2017 ) . The kinetochore ensemble spans 125 bp on each point 7 centromeres of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes and forms a single MT - binding module . 8 Kinetochores on the longer regional centromeres of most other fungi and metazoans are considered as an 9 array of the module formed on the point centromeres ( Joglekar et al . 2006 ; Joglekar et al . 2008 ; Weir et al . 10 2016 ; Musacchio and Desai 2017 ; Walstein et al . 2021 ) . This enables the large regional centromeres to 11 support the binding of multiple MTs on each chromosome instead of a single MT binding to an S . cerevisiae 12 chromosome ( Ding et al . 1993 ; Winey et al . 1995 ) . 13 The primary MT - binding module of the kinetochore ensemble is the Ndc80 complex . However , 14 the load - bearing ability of the Ndc80 complex under tension is augmented by a fungal - specific Dam1 15 complex of the outer kinetochore ( Lampert et al . 2010 ; Tien et al . 2010 ; Lampert et al . 2013 ) . This 16 heterodecameric complex , comprising of Dad1 , Dad2 , Dad3 , Dad4 , Dam1 , Duo1 , Ask1 , Hsk3 , Spc19 , and 17 Spc34 subunits , localizes explicitly to the kinetochore in an Ndc80 - dependent manner and is essential for 18 sister kinetochores to establish and maintain a bioriented state until anaphase onset ( Hofmann et al . 1998 ; 19 Cheeseman et al . 2001a ; Cheeseman et al . 2001b ; Enquist - Newman et al . 2001 ; Janke et al . 2002 ; Li et al . 20 2002 ) . They accomplish this by their ability to track and sustain attachment with the depolymerizing MT 21 ends . Consistently , mutants of the Dam1 complex subunits show severe chromosome segregation defects 22 in all organisms studied to date ( Hofmann et al . 1998 ; Enquist - Newman et al . 2001 ; Janke et al . 2002 ; Liu 23 et al . 2005 ; Thakur and Sanyal 2011 ; Chatterjee et al . 2016 ; Sridhar et al . 2021 ) . They were also found 24 essential for viability in organisms with point or short regional centromeres that bind only one MT on each 25 chromosome ( as in S . cerevisiae and Candida albicans ) as well as those harboring longer centromeric 26 chromatin like the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans ( Yadav et al . 2018 ; Sridhar et al . 2021 ) . The 27 notable exceptions to this are Schizosaccharomycces pombe and Magnaporthe orzyae known to have long 28 regional centromeres . 29 Analysis of in vitro purified Dam1 complex from S . cerevisiae and Chaetomium thermophilum 30 revealed that the heterodecameric Dam1 complex oligomerized ( 17 - mer ) to form a ring - like structure 31 around the MTs ( Miranda et al . 2005 ; Westermann et al . 2005 ; Jenni and Harrison 2018 ) . Until now , such 32 structures have been detected in vivo only in S . cerevisiae ( Ng et al . 2019 ) . The universality of this 33 4 conformation was contested by observations in S . pombe wherein the cellular levels of Dam1 complex 1 subunits were found insufficient to adopt a ring - like structure ( Gao et al . 2010 ) . They were proposed to 2 form smaller oligomeric patches ( 3 - 5mer ) along the MTs . The cellular cues that determine the physiological 3 state of Dam1 complex in each species remain unclear . 4 The kinetochore - MT interface exhibits a remarkable plasticity in terms of their composition and 5 interactions . This structural plasticity of a kinetochore plays a significant role in maintaining dynamic 6 interactions with the associated kinetochore MTs ( kMTs ) across mitotic cell cycle . A well - known example 7 is the presence of multiple linker pathways connecting the inner and outer kinetochore and to temporally 8 switch between these pathways in a cell cycle - dependent manner . ( Milks et al . 2009 ; Schleiffer et al . 2012 ; 9 Hornung et al . 2014 ; Dimitrova et al . 2016 ; Sridhar et al . 2021 ) . Proteins of the outer kinetochore like 10 Ndc80 are enriched further at anaphase once a minimal kinetochore assembles to satisfy the mitotic 11 checkpoint . This highlights the compositional variations at the kinetochore - MT interface . ( Malvezzi et al . 12 2013 ; Dhatchinamoorthy et al . 2017 ; Dhatchinamoorthy et al . 2019 ) . Studies in engineered cells revealed 13 the ability to seed and form additional kMTs beyond the number observed in a wild - type state . For instance , 14 over 50 copies of centromeric plasmids could be tolerated in S . cerevisiae as additional MTs formed to bind 15 to the kinetochores assembled on these plasmids ( Nannas et al . 2014 ) . In another ascomycete Candida 16 albicans , overexpression of CENPA resulted in the recruitment of excess outer kinetochore subunits on 17 each centromere ( Burrack et al . 2011 ) . These molecules now act as receptors to bind multiple kMTs on 18 each chromosome as opposed to a single kMT binding to each 3 - 5 kb long regional centromere in a wild - 19 type C . albicans cell . Functional benefits of this plasticity at the kinetochore are less explored in the context 20 of survival / fitness advantage in conditions that are non - conducive for chromosome segregation . 21 In this study , we explore the functional plasticity of the kinetochore - MT coupler in fungi as a 22 function of tolerance to substitution of an evolutionarily conserved arginine residue in Dad2 , a Dam1 23 complex subunit . Genetic analysis reveals that the conserved arginine residue in Dad2 is essential for 24 viability and is required for chromosome biorientation and mitotic progression in S . cerevisiae . Intriguingly , 25 a similar substitution of the corresponding arginine residue in organisms with longer centromeric chromatin 26 could be tolerated to a varying extent . 27 5 Results 1 The Dad2 Signature Sequence ( DSS ) is a conserved motif at the C - terminus in the Dad2 protein 2 family 3 The Dad2 protein family is typically defined by the presence of the Dad2 domain ( PF08654 ) , a 4 conserved amino acid sequence stretch at the N - terminus ( Figure 1A , top ) . To further understand the 5 domain architecture , we analyzed the primary amino acid sequence of Dad2 from more than 500 fungal 6 species collectively representing the three major fungal phyla - Ascomycota , Basidiomycota , and 7 Mucoromycota ( See Methods ) . We identified a 10 - amino acid - long evolutionarily conserved sequence 8 motif towards the C - terminus of Dad2 and named it as the Dad2 signature sequence ( DSS ) ( Figure 1A ) . 9 The DSS motif remains conserved across species with diverse centromere structures known among fungi . 10 While the extent of conservation of most amino acid residues is variable , the DSS possesses an almost 11 invariant arginine residue ( R ' ) ( Figure 1A ) . Further analysis of the DSS within specific fungal phyla 12 revealed other features associated with this motif . Among the members of Saccharomycotina , the second 13 position from the invariant arginine was also encoded by a positively charged amino acid such as arginine 14 ( R ) or lysine ( L ) in low frequency . However , this position was predominantly represented by proline ( P ) in 15 other fungal orders such as Pezizomycotina , Taphrinomycotina , and in the fungal phylum of 16 Basidiomycota . Across species , we find the conserved arginine R ' centered on a short hydrophobic patch . 17 Interestingly , in the available three - dimensional structure of the Dam1 complex ( PDB : 6CFZ ) ( Jenni and 18 Harrison 2018 ) , the DSS motif makes multipartite interactions with residues of Dam1 , Spc19 , and Spc34 19 subunits within the ‘central domain’ , suggesting its potential contribution to the overall structure and 20 function of the Dam1 complex ( Figure 1B ) . Particularly , the conserved arginine residue makes both 21 hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with residues of Spc19 which were also conserved across several 22 fungi ( Figure S1 ) . Considering the extent of conservation of the DSS across the three major fungal phyla , 23 we sought to understand the functional significance of this domain in Dad2 , especially its conserved 24 arginine residue in two fungal systems - S . cerevisiae and C . albicans , diverged from each other 117 mya 25 ( Shen et al . 2018 ) , and known to possess distinct centromere structures and kinetochore architectures . 26 The essentiality of the DSS is not a conserved feature across centromere lengths 27 To study the DSS function in S . cerevisiae , we generated constructs expressing mutant versions of 28 Dad2 bearing alanine substitutions of the conserved arginine residues or a truncated version lacking the 29 entire DSS domain ( ScDad2 - R126A , ScDad2 - R128A , and ScDad2 - ΔDSS ; Figure 1C ) . To test the function 30 of these mutants , we used a previously reported temperature - sensitive ( ts ) mutant of DAD2 wherein the 31 genomic allele of DAD2 was deleted and a ts allele was reintegrated ( CJY077 , dad2 : : KanMX6 his3Δ200 32 6 leu2Δ1 : : pCJ055 ( dad2 ts ) ) ( Janke et al . 2002 ) . This mutant strain was independently transformed with a 1 pRS313 - based CEN / ARS plasmid containing either wild - type or mutant versions of DAD2 ( as in Figure 2 1C ) tagged with GFP at the C - terminus . In all these strains , the expression of DAD2 - GFP was driven by 3 the native promoter of Sc DAD2 . The functional significance of each of these residues was tested by a spot 4 dilution assay to determine the ability of the mutants to support growth at an elevated temperature of 37  C 5 ( Figure 1D ) . As expected , the strain YSR01 carrying the empty vector was unable to grow at this 6 temperature , but the strain YSR02 expressing ScDad2 - FL grew well . Strikingly , the strains YSR03 7 expressing ScDad2 - R126A and YSR05 expressing ScDad2 - ΔDSS failed to grow at 37  C , revealing that 8 R126 makes the DSS essential for Dad2 function in S . cerevisiae . However , the strain YSR04 expressing 9 ScDad2 - R128A also supported growth at an elevated temperature , suggestive of a non - essential role of 10 R128 for viability . To rule out the lack of expression of these mutant proteins as a cause for their inability 11 to complement growth at an elevated temperature , we confirmed the localization of the ectopic Dad2 protein 12 ( wild - type , mutant , or truncated ) at this temperature ( Figure 1E ) . All versions of Dad2 except ScDad2 - 13 Δ DSS showed detectable punctate localization signals typical of clustered budding yeast kinetochores and 14 their localization signal intensities were comparable ( Figure 1F ) ( Cheeseman et al . 2001b ; Janke et al . 15 2002 ) . These results strongly indicated that the entire DSS motif is essential for the kinetochore localization 16 of ScDad2 . Based on the location of the DSS in the Dam1 complex monomer , we suspect that the deletion 17 of the DSS domain might affect the integrity of the complex and in turn the localization of Dad2 . 18 To rule out the temperature sensitivity of mutant cells expressing ScDad2 - R126A and ScDad2 - 19 Δ DSS observed in the above assay , we tested the essentiality of this residue at an ambient growth 20 temperature ( 30  C ) as well . A tester strain was engineered such that the genomic allele of Dad2 was deleted 21 after expressing Dad2 from an ectopic allele cloned in a centromeric plasmid carrying the URA3 gene 22 ( Figure S2A ) . This strain was then transformed with pRS313 - based plasmids containing wild - type or 23 mutant versions of DAD2 . The ability of strains to lose the protection allele present in the plasmid and 24 support subsequent growth on media containing 5 ' FOA was used to test for the essentiality of the mutant 25 Dad2 protein for viability . The inability of YSR10 expressing ScDad2 - R126A and YSR12 expressing 26 ScDad2 - Δ DSS to grow on the Ura + counter - selection media containing 5 ' FOA at various dilutions tested in 27 the spot dilution assay confirmed the essentiality of R126 and thereby the role of the DSS in cell viability 28 ( Figure S2A ) . These results confirmed that the highly conserved R126 residue is a critical amino acid for 29 the essential function performed by Dad2 in S . cerevisiae . 30 Since ScDad2 - R126A and ScDad2 - ΔDSS mutants were inviable in S . cerevisiae , we sought to test 31 the importance of the corresponding arginine residues in Dad2 that is essential for viability in C . albicans . 32 To test this in C . albicans , we used a previously reported conditional mutant of dad2 ( J108 , dad2 / PCK1pr - 33 7 DAD2 ) ( Thakur and Sanyal 2011 ) . In this conditional mutant , the only genomic allele of Ca DAD2 is 1 expressed under the PCK1 promoter that shuts down its expression in the presence of dextrose in growth 2 media ( Figure S2B ) . While the conditional mutant J108 was unable to grow in media supplemented with 3 dextrose , the complemented strains J108A and J108B expressing CaDad2 - FL and CaDad2 - ΔDSS 4 respectively supported growth in this media , suggesting that unlike in S . cerevisiae , the deletion of the DSS 5 motif does not make C . albicans cells inviable ( Figure S2C ) . We further validated this observation by 6 engineering the only allele of DAD2 in ASR01 ( dad2 / DAD2 ) to express GFP tagged versions of CaDad2 - 7 FL , - R92A , and - ΔDSS in strains ASR02 , ASR03 , and ASR04 respectively ( Figure 1G ) . Spot dilution 8 assays were performed to assess if any of the CaDad2 derivatives exhibited growth defects as compared to 9 the wild - type strain . While we could observe a mild growth retardation at 30  C , the growth of mutant strains 10 ASR03 and ASR04 expressing CaDad2 - R92A and CaDad2 - ΔDSS respectively was significantly 11 compromised at a lower temperature of 18  C when compared with CaDad2 - FL expressing strain ASR02 12 or the wild - type strain SN148 grown under similar conditions ( Figure 1H ) . We could detect punctate 13 localization signals in strains expressing not only CaDad2 - R92A but also CaDad2 - ΔDSS , suggesting that 14 kinetochore localization was neither affected by alanine substitution of the critical arginine residue nor 15 when the entire DSS was deleted in C . albicans ( Figure 1I - J ) . These experiments reveal that the presence 16 of the evolutionarily conserved arginine residue in Dad2 is dispensable for the viability of C . albicans under 17 normal growth conditions . Having observed such phenotypic differences in mutants of Dad2 in S . 18 cerevisiae and C . albicans we sought to dissect the mutant phenotype further to study the extent of 19 functional conservation of the DSS between them . 20 The arginine residue R126 in the conserved DSS motif is critical for proper spindle dynamics and 21 bipolar attachment of kinetochores in S . cerevisiae 22 To probe deeper into the role of the DSS and its conserved arginine R126 in chromosome 23 segregation in S . cerevisiae , we generated conditional mutants of DAD2 by replacing the endogenous DAD2 24 promoter with the GAL 1 - 10 promoter in the strain SBY12503 where spindle pole bodies ( Spc110 is tagged 25 with mCherry ) as well as CEN3 are marked ( by the binding of GFP - LacI to LacO arrays integrated adjacent 26 to CEN3 ) ( Umbreit et al . 2014 ) . The resulting strain YSR13 ( GALpr - DAD2 ) fails to grow when dextrose 27 is the sole carbon source in the growth media ( Figure S3A - B ) . This conditional mutant strain YSR13 was 28 then independently transformed with vectors that reintegrate wild - type or mutant versions of DAD2 29 expressed from the DAD2 promoter at the native locus . In line with our previous observations , the 30 conditional mutant complemented with ScDad2 - FL in YSR14 and ScDad2 - R128A in YSR16 supported 31 growth on dextrose - containing media . On the other hand , the strains YSR15 and YSR17 expressing 32 8 ScDad2 - R126A and ScDad2 - ΔDS S respectively could not complement function as they were unable to 1 support the growth of the conditional mutant on this media ( Figure S3B ) . 2 To identify the defects that led to viability loss , the dad2 conditional mutant YSR13 along with the 3 reintegrant strains YSR14 through YSR17 were grown for 8 h in dextrose - containing media to deplete Dad2 4 expressed under the GAL promoter . Cells were harvested and analyzed for cell cycle progression , spindle 5 dynamics , and kinetochore - MT orientation post depletion ( Figure 2A ) . Upon 8 h of growth in repressive 6 media , flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide - stained cells revealed the parent strain YSR13 7 ( GALpr - DAD2 ) was arrested at the G2 / M stage in line with previous observations ( Figure 2B ) . The 8 impaired MT - binding due to the lack of any Dam1 complex subunits is known to activate the spindle 9 assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) ( Hofmann et al . 1998 ; Janke et al . 2002 ; Thakur and Sanyal 2011 ) , resulting 10 in the observed G2 / M arrest . This arrest was rescued when the mutant was complemented with ScDad2 - FL 11 or ScDad2 - R128A as observed in YSR14 and YSR16 respectively ( Figure 2B , S3C ) . However , no rescue 12 in the arrest was observed in strains YSR15 and YSR17 expressing ScDad2 - R126A and ScDad2 - Δ DSS 13 respectively , suggesting the conserved arginine R126 in the DSS motif is essential for mitotic progression 14 in S . cerevisiae . 15 At the same hour of Dad2 protein depletion , we examined the spindle dynamics using the 16 fluorescently tagged spindle pole body protein , Spc110 - mCherry , as the marker . In line with the metaphase 17 arrest observed upon depletion of Dad2 in YSR13 , we found these cells to have a short mitotic spindle ( < 18 2 µm ) ( Figure 2C ) . The conditional mutant strain , when complemented with ScDad2 - FL as in YSR14 or 19 with ScDad2 - R128A as in YSR16 , was able to transit metaphase and enter anaphase , as suggested by an 20 increased average spindle length of > 2 µm ( Figure 2C ) . We did not observe the rescue of the mitotic arrest 21 and a corresponding increase in the spindle length when the same conditional mutant was complemented 22 with ScDad2 - R126A as in YSR15 or ScDad2 - ΔDSS as in YSR17 ( Figure 2C ) . 23 To validate if the observed defects were consequential of improper kinetochore - MT orientation at 24 metaphase , we studied localization of centromeres ( marked by CEN3 - GFP ) relative to the spindle pole 25 bodies ( SPBs , marked by Spc110 - mCherry ) to monitor the nature of these attachments ( Umbreit et al . 26 2014 ) . Sister kinetochores were bioriented in majority of the cells in YSR14 expressing ScDad2 - FL or 27 YSR16 expressing ScDad2 - R128A ( Figure 2D - E ) . By contrast , a significant proportion of YSR15 cells 28 expressing ScDad2 - R126A or YSR17 cells expressing ScDad2 - ΔDSS exhibited monoriented kinetochores 29 as in the case in YSR13 upon depletion of Dad2 . Together , these observations suggest that the conserved 30 arginine residue R126 in the DSS motif plays a critical role in facilitating biorientation of the kinetochores , 31 lacking which cells remain arrested at metaphase . The observation that the phenotype of mutants expressing 32 ScDad2 - R126A or ScDad2 - ΔDSS are comparable to the depletion of Dad2 suggests the DSS region , 33 9 particularly its R126 residue , plays a significant role in the proper functioning of the Dam1 complex in S . 1 cerevisiae . 2 DSS is critical for oligomerization and MT binding of Dam1 complex 3 Our genetic studies clearly suggest that the kinetochores bearing mutant versions of Dad2 are 4 unable to attach or remain attached with the MT ends resulting in an increased proportion of cells with 5 monooriented kinetochores . We wondered if the observed phenotype in DSS mutants is indicative of 6 structural changes in the Dam1 complex . 7 To understand this further , we modified the sequenced encoding for Dad2 in the previously reported 8 polycistronic expression vector ( Miranda et al . 2005 ) encoding all 10 subunits of the ScDam1 complex to 9 express ScDad2 - R126A or ScDad2 -  DSS instead of wild - type Dad2 . We then expressed and purified three 10 versions of the Dam1 complex from E . coli containing either Dad2 - FL ( DASH WT ) , Dad2 - R126A 11 ( DASH R126A ) , or Dad2 - ΔDSS ( DASH ΔDSS ) respectively . During the purification process , the DASH WT 12 eluted as a single peak upon gel filtration ( Figure 3A , peak fraction highlighted in gray ) . On the other hand , 13 both DASH R126A and DASH ΔDSS eluted later than the DASH WT . Further , we also observed a second peak 14 around Ve = 18 mL in the mutants that were more pronounced than that observed in the DASH WT profile . 15 These are suggestive of structural or / and compositional changes in the complex . We analyzed the 16 copurifying subunits from each of the mutant peak fractions ( b for DASH R126A and d for DASH Δ DSS ) to that 17 of DASH WT by SDS - PAGE . We also included the fractions marked ‘a’ and ‘c ' in the elution profile of the 18 mutants that corresponded to the peak fraction from the DASH WT purification . We find that the DASH R126A 19 complex does not contain the subunit Spc19 indicative of an incomplete complex in the presence of this 20 mutation ( Figure 3B ) . Intriguingly , this was not the case with DASH ΔDSS which contained a band 21 corresponding to Spc19 despite eluting at a higher volume as compared to DASH WT . These observations 22 clearly suggest that disruptions in the DSS affect the structure of the complex . 23 We next tested if the changes described above affected their ability to oligomerize into rings around 24 MTs , a defining feature of the Dam1 complex . The proteins derived from both the peaks for DASH R126A 25 and DASH Δ DSS were used in these experiments . In the presence of MTs , we could detect the rings formed 26 by the DASH WT complex by negative stain electron microscopy ( Figure 3C ) . However , the mutant 27 complexes DASH R126A and DASH ΔDSS failed to form such structures indicating that the DSS region is 28 essential for oligomerization of the Dam1 complex to form higher assemblies like the ring ( Figure 3C ) . 29 Previous studies on the Dam1 complex have identified oligomerization - deficient mutants that still 30 retained the ability to bind MTs . We tested this property in our mutant complexes by MT - cosedimentation 31 assay . The DASH WT was consistently detected in the pellet fraction in all the conditions we tested ( 0 . 5 µM 32 10 to 2 µM MTs in two - fold increments ) suggesting that they physically bound to MTs as reported previously 1 ( Figure 3D , S4 ) . In contrast , the binding of both DASH R126A and DASH ΔDS S to the MTs was severely 2 compromised across the conditions tested . Our results suggest that the DSS domain plays a significant role 3 in both the structure ( oligomerization ) and function ( MT binding ) of the Dam1 complex in S . cerevisiae . 4 These defects are consistent with our observations in vivo and can be correlated with the increased 5 frequency of monooriented kinetochores in DSS mutants . 6 It is known that Dad2 is essential for viability in both C . albicans and S . cerevisiae ( Hofmann et al . 7 1998 ; Janke et al . 2002 ; Thakur and Sanyal 2011 ) . While the DSS mutants were viable in C . albicans they 8 were found lethal S . cerevisiae . Considering our observations described above , it is possible that CaDam1 9 complex is structurally divergent from the budding yeast version , or the kinetochore - MT interface in C . 10 albicans shows sufficient plasticity to tolerate variations in the Dam1 complex . To better understand the 11 observation in C . albicans , we next studied the kinetochore integrity and chromosome segregation fidelity 12 of these mutants in further detail . 13 The conserved arginine residue in the DSS is essential for faithful chromosome segregation in C . 14 albicans 15 To test for functional conservation of the DSS in C . albicans , we used the strains ASR02 , ASR03 16 and ASR04 expressing CaDad2 - FL , CaDad2 - R92A , and CaDad2 - Δ DSS respectively from the native 17 genomic locus . A typical feature of C . albicans kinetochore is that any defect / mutation compromising the 18 structural integrity of the kinetochore results in the disintegration of the kinetochore ensemble followed by 19 proteasomal degradation of CENPA ( Thakur and Sanyal 2012 ) . We used this property as a test to assess 20 the integrity of the kinetochore upon mutations in the DSS . We engineered the strains ASR02 through 21 ASR04 to express protein - A tagged CENPA . Immunoblotting revealed comparable levels of CENPA 22 between ASR07 cells expressing CaDad2 - FL , and the mutant strains ASR08 and ASR09 , expressing 23 CaDad2 - R92A and CaDad2 - ΔDSS respectively ( Figure 4A ) . The absence of CENPA degradation in this 24 species unlike the case with depletion of Dad2 or other Dam1 complex subunits ( Thakur and Sanyal 2012 ) , 25 is a strong indicator of an intact kinetochore ensemble . This is further supported by the detection of punctate 26 localization signals of Dad2 mutants with similar fluorescence intensities as compared to wild - type Dad2 27 ( Figure 1J ) . Together , our observations suggest that neither the deletion of the DSS nor substitution in the 28 conserved arginine residue in the DSS affects the kinetochore assembly in C . albicans . 29 To understand the growth defects of dad2 mutants observed at a lower temperature , we grew these 30 strains overnight at 30  C , reinoculated them to fresh media in duplicates , and allowed them to complete 31 two generations each at 30  C and 18  C , respectively . Analysis of cell cycle progression of strains grown at 32 11 30  C revealed a modest increase in the proportion of cells at the G2 / M stage when they expressed CaDad2 - 1 R92A as in ASR03 or CaDad2 - ΔDSS as in ASR04 when compared to the control strain ASR02 that 2 expressed CaDad2 - FL ( Figure 4B , Figure S5A ) . The frequency of G2 / M arrested cells was further 3 amplified when the DSS mutants were grown at 18  C wherein most of the cells displayed this phenotype 4 ( Figure 4B ) . Given that the kinetochore assembly remained unaffected in the DSS mutants ( Figure 1J and 5 4A ) , we suspected the increase in cells at G2 / M and cold - sensitive phenotype of these mutants to be 6 consequential of aberrant kinetochore - MT interactions . 7 When cells were collected for flow cytometry analysis , additional aliquots of similarly grown cells 8 were examined to analyze their nuclear segregation patterns in the strains ASR02 , ASR03 and ASR04 9 expressing CaDad2 - FL , CaDad2 - R92A , and CaDad2 - ΔDSS respectively . We observed ~ 2 - fold increase in 10 the frequency of unsegregated nuclei in strains expressing CaDad2 - R92A and CaDad2 - ΔD SS as compared 11 to cells expressing CaDad2 - FL when grown at 30  C ( Figure 4C ) . This frequency further increased to > 3 - 12 fold when these strains were grown at 18  C ( Figure 4C ) . Each of these strains was engineered to express 13 an SPB marker Tub4 - mCherry to study the spindle dynamics and correlate them with the frequency of 14 unsegregated nuclei . In the strains ASR13 and ASR14 expressing CaDad2 - R92A and CaDad2 - ΔDSS 15 respectively , we observed a significant increase in the frequency of large - budded cells showing short 16 spindles ( < 2 µm ) as compared to ASR12 that expressed CaDad2 - FL at 30  C ( Figure 4D ) . This was further 17 reflected in the reduction in the average spindle length in these mutant strains ( Figure 4E ) . We were unable 18 to perform this assay at 18  C as the DSS mutants showed an aberrant elongated large - budded phenotype at 19 this temperature , suggesting that epitope - tagged Tub4 could be non - functional in this condition . The 20 increased proportion of cells at metaphase with the spindle length ( SPB - SPB distance ) of < 2 µm and an 21 unsegregated nuclear mass is suggestive of a delayed anaphase onset in these mutants . 22 The observed delay in mitotic progression could be due to the inability of these mutants to achieve 23 a bioriented state , as observed in S . cerevisiae ( Figure 2D ) . Such defective kinetochore - MT attachments 24 which do not generate tension are detected by sensors like the Aurora B kinase ( Ipl1 in yeast ) that eventually 25 activate the spindle assembly checkpoint until proper biorientation is achieved ( Biggins and Murray 2001 ; 26 Tanaka et al . 2002 ; Franck et al . 2007 ; Akiyoshi et al . 2010 ) . We suspected that the accumulation of cells 27 with metaphase - like spindle in the DSS mutants could also be due to a similar defect . As mentioned above , 28 ASR03 ( CaDad2 - R92A - GFP ) and ASR04 ( CaDad2 - ΔDSS - GFP ) cells were arrested completely at the 29 G2 / M stage when grown at 18  C . We selected this condition to score for bypass of the G2 / M arrest in the 30 corresponding checkpoint deficient mutants ASR17 ( Δ mad2 CaDad2 - R92A - GFP ) and ASR18 ( Δ mad2 31 CaDad2 - ΔDSS - GFP ) by flow cytometry ( Figure S5B ) . The presence of unbudded cells ( 2N population ) in 32 ASR17 and ASR18 mutants as compared to the G2 / M arrested phenotype in ASR03 and ASR04 cells 33 12 suggested that the DSS mutants were indeed arrested at metaphase . We also analyzed these strains for 1 segregation of the sister kinetochores marked by CaDad2 - GFP when grown at 30  C and 18  C ( Figure S5C ) . 2 At both the temperatures tested , the percentage of large - budded cells with unsegregated sister kinetochores 3 in the mother bud ( < 2 µm between CaDad2 puncta ) was reduced in the checkpoint deficient Dad2 mutants 4 ASR17 and ASR18 as compared to their checkpoint - proficient parent strains , further validating a delay in 5 anaphase onset in these cells . 6 By comparing the results obtained thus far in S . cerevisiae and C . albicans , it is evident that the 7 function of the DSS is conserved between these species , with an obvious reduction in the severity of the 8 DSS mutant phenotype in C . albicans . The Dam1 complex is known to play a critical role in chromosome 9 segregation by strengthening the kinetochore - MT associations , especially in instances where a single MT 10 binds to a chromosome like in S . cerevisiae and C . albicans . Although the number of MTs binding a 11 chromosome is the same between these species , a single CENPA nucleosome forms the basis of MT 12 attachment in S . cerevisiae ( Winey et al . 1995 ) . On the other hand , one among four CENPA nucleosomes 13 anchors the MTs in C . albicans ( Joglekar et al . 2008 ) . We speculated that the presence of additional CENPA 14 nucleosomes confers a degree of tolerance towards mutations in the DSS . To test if this correlation indeed 15 exists , we studied the functional significance of the DSS in the ascomycete S . pombe , which is a classic 16 example for the large regional centromere structure . 17 DSS is dispensable for Dad2 function in S . pombe 18 Unlike any of the species we tested earlier , dad2 mutants are viable in S . pombe ( Liu et al . 2005 ; 19 Kobayashi et al . 2007 ) . However , these mutants undergo prolonged mitosis due to biorientation defects that 20 result in lagging chromosomes . At lower temperatures , these mutants missegregated chromosomes causing 21 a cold - sensitive phenotype ( Kobayashi et al . 2007 ) . We exploited this property to study functional 22 significance of DSS in SpDad2 as follows . Null mutants of dad2 in a strain where the chromosomes are 23 tagged by LacO - LacI - GFP system have been reported previously ( Strain 1619 , ( Blyth et al . 2018 ) ) . We 24 independently reintegrated SpDad2 - FL ( PSR01 ) and SpDad2 - ΔDSS ( PSR02 ) into the native genomic locus 25 with their expression driven by the native Dad2 promoter ( Figure 5A ) . 26 Spot dilution assays did not reveal any apparent growth difference between dad2 null mutants and 27 the reintegrant strains PSR01 and PSR02 expressing SpDad2 - FL and SpDad2 -  DSS respectively at 28 ambient growth temperatures ( Figure 5B ) . Reintegrating Sp - Dad2FL rescued the cold sensitive phenotype 29 observed in dad2 null mutant strain SP1619 as expected . Further , we also observed a rescue in PSR02 cells 30 expressing SpDad2 - ΔDSS , suggesting that DSS is not essential for Dad2 function in S . pombe . We 31 strengthened our correlation further by testing for the essentiality of DSS in Dad2 function in another large 32 13 regional centromere containing species C . neoformans . Unlike the species studied above , C . neoformans 1 belongs to Basidiomycota and diverged from a common ancestor it shared with S . pombe ~ 642 MYA 2 ( Kumar et al . 2017 ) . 3 The conserved arginine R102 in CnDad2 is dispensable for mitotic progression in C . neoformans 4 We generated constructs to introduce an alanine substitution mutation in the conserved arginine 5 residue ( R102 in CnDad2 ) as well as for the deletion of the entire DSS region in CnDad2 and express them 6 along with mCherry tagged at the C - terminus in C . neoformans ( Figure 5C ) . As a control , another construct 7 to express an unaltered full - length CnDad2 sequence was also generated . Each of these constructs was used 8 to transform the strain CNV108 ( expressing GFP - H4 ) ( Kozubowski et al . 2013 ) to generate CNSD169 9 ( CnDad2 - FL - mCherry , GFP - H4 ) , CNSD170 ( CnDad2 - R102A - mCherry , GFP - H4 ) , and CNSD171 10 ( CnDad2 - ΔDSS - mCherry , GFP - H4 ) . 11 Spot dilution assays performed at routine growth conditions in YPD at 30  C revealed that neither 12 the point mutation R102A nor the deletion of the entire DSS motif of CnDad2 resulted in an obvious growth 13 defect , suggesting that the DSS mutants are viable in C . neoformans as well ( Figure 5D ) . We also examined 14 growth inhibitions of these mutants at a lower temperature ( 14  C ) or in the presence of thiabendazole ( 6 15 µg / mL ) , conditions used to test mutants for defective kinetochore - MT associations . We failed to observe 16 any growth defects in the mutant strains CNSD170 and CNSD171 expressing CnDad2 - R102A and 17 CnDad2 - ΔDS S respectively , as compared to CNSD169 cells expressing CnDad2 - FL ( Figure 5D ) . To 18 corroborate these observations , we grew each of these strains to log phase at 30  C . We did not observe a 19 significant increase in the number of large - budded cells in strains expressing wild - type or mutant versions 20 of Dad2 bearing alanine substituted conserved arginine residue in the DSS or deletion of the entire DSS 21 itself ( Figure 5E ) . However , further analysis of nuclear segregation by localization of GFP - tagged histone 22 H4 revealed that the CNSD171 mutant strain expressing the DSS deletion , but not CNSD170 with the point 23 mutation CnDad2 - R102A , had a significant increase in the proportion of large - budded cells with an 24 unsegregated nuclear mass ( Figure 5F - G ) . We do not find any significant difference in the fluorescence 25 intensities between CnDad2 - FL , CnDad2 - R102A , and CnDad2 - Δ DSS , suggesting that the kinetochore 26 structure was not compromised by the mutations introduced ( Figure 5H ) . We validated this further by 27 testing the levels of another outer kinetochore protein Dad1in the strains CNSD172 , CNSD173 , and 28 CNSD174 expressing CnDad2 - FL , CnDad2 - R102A , and CnDad2 - Δ DSS respectively ( Figure 5I ) . 29 These results suggest that the conserved arginine residue in Dad2 is dispensable for viability and 30 timely mitotic progression in C . neoformans unlike in S . cerevisiae or C . albicans . However , a small but 31 14 significant increase in the large bud arrested cells when the entire DSS was deleted , suggested importance 1 of the motif in chromosome segregation in C . neoformans . 2 The tolerance of S . pombe and C . neoformans to mutations in the DSS is suggestive of a non - 3 essential role for the conserved arginine residue / DSS in Dam1 complex function in these species as 4 compared to S . cerevisiae or C . albicans . Despite a high level of conservation at the amino acid sequence 5 in the DSS , the striking differences in the dependence on this conserved arginine residue for mitotic 6 progression across the evolutionarily diverged species represent a strong inverse correlations with the the 7 centromere length . 8 9 Discussion 10 In this study , we identify an evolutionarily conserved domain , the DSS , at the C - terminus of Dad2 11 that hosts a highly conserved arginine residue . Our phylogenetic analysis of sequenced genomes across 12 Ascomycota , Basidiomycota , and some species of Mucoromycota , reveals that the arginine residue remains 13 conserved for more than 700 million years . Alanine substitution analysis suggests that this arginine residue 14 in the evolutionarily conserved DSS motif is essential for viability and timely mitotic progression in S . 15 cerevisiae as the mutant cells irreversibly arrested at the G2 / M stage with a metaphase - like spindle . The 16 presence of monooriented kinetochores in the DSS mutants in S . cerevisiae highlights the functional 17 significance of the conserved arginine residue in establishing sister chromatid biorientation . This could be 18 correlated with the inability of mutant Dam1 complex to form rings and bind to MTs in vitro . We observed 19 similar mitotic defects , albeit at a lower frequency , when the corresponding arginine residue was mutated 20 to alanine in Dad2 in C . albicans harboring small regional centromeres . A small but significant increase in 21 mitotic defects was observed only upon deletion of the entire DSS in C . neoformans that possesses large 22 regional centromeres . The alanine substitution of the conserved arginine in the DSS is neither lethal nor 23 resulted in accumulation of cells with unsegregated nuclei , suggestive of a redundant function conferred by 24 the arginine residue in C . neoformans . In S . pombe , another representative of the species with large regional 25 centromeres , DSS was found dispensable in rescuing the cold sensitive phenotype of dad2 mutants 26 suggesting a functional redundancy . The diminishing significance of the DSS with increasing lengths of 27 centromeric chromatin ( Figure 6A ) , tempted us to speculate that larger centromeres may have evolved to 28 develop tolerance to mutations that cause lethality to an organism possessing point centromeres . 29 The Dam1 complex is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of sister chromatid 30 biorientation until the SAC is satisfied ( Cheeseman et al . 2001a ; Janke et al . 2002 ; Franco et al . 2007 ; 31 Tanaka et al . 2007 ) . Conditional mutants of Dam1 complex subunits arrest at the large - budded stage with 32 15 short spindles and an unsegregated nuclear mass ( Cheeseman et al . 2001b ; Janke et al . 2002 ; Li et al . 2002 ) . 1 We find a similar phenotype upon alanine substitution of the conserved arginine in the DSS in S . cerevisiae . 2 This suggests that the DSS , particularly the conserved arginine R126 , could play an essential role in 3 maintaining the overall integrity of the Dam1 complex in vivo . Some of the known factors that govern the 4 function of the Dam1 complex include ( a ) its interaction with the MTs and the Ndc80 complex for 5 kinetochore localization ( Janke et al . 2002 ; Li et al . 2002 ; Wong et al . 2007 ; Maure et al . 2011 ; Lampert et 6 al . 2013 ; Kim et al . 2017 ) , and ( b ) its ability to oligomerize to a ring - like structure around MTs that enables 7 it to sustain its MT association under tension ( Miranda et al . 2007 ; Umbreit et al . 2014 ; Zelter et al . 2015 ) . 8 Our biochemical reconstitutions indeed find disruption of both these aspects of the Dam1 complex function 9 by R126A mutation . 10 In the known structure of the Dam1 protomer ( Jenni and Harrison 2018 ) , we mapped the C terminus 11 of Dad2 to the central core domain known to be essential for the stability of the Dam1 monomer . The amino 12 acids in the DSS were found in interacting proximity with the Spc19 , Spc34 , and Dam1 subunits ( Figure 13 S6 ) . Consistently , Spc19 failed to coelute with other subunits when Dad2FL was replaced with Dad2R126A 14 in the DASH expression vector . The resulting mutant complex lacking Spc19 was unable to oligomerize 15 into rings even in the presence of MTs . To understand this further , we analyzed the interface between Dam1 16 monomers from previous crosslinking analysis and coarse grain models ( Zelter et al . 2015 ; Legal et al . 17 2016 ) . Contacts between Spc34 and Ask1 of two Dam1 monomers form the major interaction interface 18 between them . This is further supported by the contacts between Duo1 from one monomer and Spc19 and 19 Ask1 of another . The loss of Spc19 subunit like the case in R126A mutant could have a direct impact on 20 oligomerization of the complex due to the loss of its interaction with Duo1 . The loss of Spc19 can also have 21 a significant effect on the position and interactions made by Spc34 , a key player in inter - Dam1 interface , 22 thereby having an indirect impact on oligomerization . 23 We suspect the observed loss of MT - binding to be a consequence of oligomerization defects . It is 24 known that oligomerization is critical for stable association with MTs under tension ( Umbreit et al . 2014 ) . 25 Deletion of Hsk3 subunit resulted in an oligomerization defective 6 - mer complex that failed to form rings 26 around MTs and showed a weaker ability to sustain MT binding under tension ( Miranda et al . 2007 ; Umbreit 27 et al . 2014 ) . In the oligomerization - deficient complexes that we purified with mutations in the DSS , we 28 observed very weak / no binding to MTs in the cosedimentation assay across the conditions we tested . 29 Perhaps sensitive techniques like the rupture force assay used by Umbreit et . al . would detect residual 30 binding and the loss in binding efficiency . Strikingly , the mutant complexes described in this study and in 31 Umbriet et al . retain the subunits Dam1 and Duo1 , which are the only two proteins known to crosslink 32 microtubules within this complex ( Umbreit et al . 2014 ; Zelter et al . 2015 ; Legal et al . 2016 ) . Loss of MT 33 16 binding despite their presence further reiterates the importance of oligomerization on the Dam1 complex 1 function . Consistent with these findings , we do observe biorientation defects in the DSS mutants that are a 2 mark of weak or unstable kinetochore - MT interactions . 3 Given that a coupler like the Dam1 complex is indispensable for viability in species with a single 4 kMT binding to a chromosome as in S . cerevisiae and C . albicans ( Winey et al . 1995 ; Cheeseman et al . 5 2001b ; Janke et al . 2002 ; Li et al . 2002 ; Burrack et al . 2011 ; Thakur and Sanyal 2011 ) , one would expect 6 similar consequences to mutations in the DSS in both these species . While the DSS function is conserved 7 in these species , the mutants are viable in C . albicans , unlike S . cerevisiae . We ascribe the tolerance 8 observed in C . albicans to the presence an accessory CENPA cloud at the centromere cluster ( Joglekar et 9 al . 2008 ; Thakur and Sanyal 2013 ; Fukagawa and Earnshaw 2014 ) . 10 In an organism like S . cerevisiae , a single kinetochore module , assembled on 1 - 2 CENPA 11 nucleosomes , serves as a MT receptor on each chromosome ( Joglekar et al . 2006 ; Furuyama and Biggins 12 2007 ; Cieslinski et al . 2021 ) . The strength of this association solely determines sister chromatid 13 biorientation and their subsequent segregation . Thus , it is conceivable that the mutations compromising the 14 kinetochore - MT association would not be tolerated in S . cerevisiae ( Figure 6B ) . Indeed , several point 15 mutants of subunits of the Dam1 complex have been shown to be lethal ( Cheeseman et al . 2001a ; Janke et 16 al . 2002 ) . Although C . albicans centromeres tether a single kMT , there are ~ 4 CENPA nucleosomes on 17 each of the 3 - 5 kb long C . albicans centromeres ( Joglekar et al . 2008 ) . We speculated that additional 18 kinetochore subunits are recruited to these ' spare ' CENPA nucleosomes in C . albicans , serving as receptors 19 that facilitate the binding of multiple MTs to a chromosome when a ' need ' arises . Such a failsafe mechanism 20 can ensure proper chromosome segregation even with a weaker mutant kinetochore , like the DSS mutants 21 ( Figure 6B ) . Indeed , we observed significantly higher levels of Ndc80 at the kinetochore cluster in the DSS 22 mutants that were able to segregate their chromosomes in post - metaphase cells as compared to the control 23 wild - type cells ( Figure 6C ) . The subset of cells that were unable to recruit excess outer kinetochore subunits 24 may fail to segregate chromosomes , thereby losing viability . This clearly demonstrates that the survivors 25 in mutant strains expressing mutant versions of Dad2 such as CaDad2 - R92A and CaDad2 - ΔDSS are primed 26 to recruit multiple MTs to a chromosome . 27 Operating such a mechanism requires the availability of surplus kinetochore subunits and the ability 28 to seed the required number of additional MTs , neither of which are limiting in a cell . Overexpression of 29 CENPA in C . albicans has been shown to increase the copy number of the outer kinetochore proteins 30 without crossing the wild - type boundaries of the centromeric chromatin ( Burrack et al . 2011 ) . Further , 31 engineered strains in both C . albicans and S . cerevisiae formed additional kMTs suggesting that the 32 stoichiometry of the number of kMTs to the number of chromosomes can be dynamic ( Burrack et al . 2011 ; 33 17 Nannas et al . 2014 ) . The lack of such a mechanism in S . cerevisiae despite these abilities can be attributed 1 to their point centromere structure . The size restriction and dependence on DNA sequence prevent the 2 enrichment or spreading of kinetochore proteins at the native centromere , thereby impeding the formation 3 of additional MT attachments . 4 We also propose an alternate , non - mutually exclusive possibility wherein the enrichment of Ndc80 5 by itself can facilitate efficient MT capture by a weakened kinetochore . Several studies have shown that 6 Ndc80 can form crosslinks with adjacent Ndc80 molecules through the unstructured loop region ( Maure et 7 al . 2011 ; Polley et al . 2023 ) . The consequence of such homotypic crosslinking is a cooperative increase in 8 the affinity to MTs binding and the ability to stay associated with MTs under tension . This translates to the 9 increased stability of end - on attachments in vivo ( Hsu and Toda 2011 ; Tang et al . 2013 ; Helgeson et al . 10 2018 ; Polley et al . 2023 ) . Despite the unstructured loop being conserved across eukaryotes , the loop - 11 mediated multivalency of Ndc80 molecules can have a stronger impact on MT binding in large regional 12 centromeres as compared to point centromeres due to the possible limits of Ndc80 enrichment that can be 13 accommodated . 14 When compared to C . albicans , we find mutations in the DSS to be tolerated better in S . pombe and 15 C . neoformans in physiological as well as stress conditions like low - temperature growth or in the presence 16 of sub - lethal doses of spindle poisons like thiabendazole . While we did not directly score for the mitotic 17 progression or chromosome segregation fidelity in S . pombe , we observed rescue of cold sensitive 18 phenotype of dad2 mutants that resulted from defective mitosis , even with SpDad2 -  DSS . Unlike S . pombe , 19 depleting Dad2 results in viability loss in C . neoformans ( Sridhar et al . 2021 ) which could be rescued with 20 CnDad2 -  DSS . Both these species harbor large regional centromeres . It is known that the S . pombe 21 chromosomes have ~ 10kb long CENPA enriched centromeric chromatin with 10 - 15 CENPA nucleosomes 22 that collectively tether 2 - 3 kMTs ( Joglekar et al . 2008 ; Coffman et al . 2011 ; Rhind et al . 2011 ) ( Ding et al . 23 1993 ) . Based on these estimates , the C . neoformans centromeres that span 27 - 64 kb are expected to have at 24 least 10 CENPA nucleosomes that collectively tether multiple kMTs ( > 2 kMTs ) per chromosome . This is 25 further supported by the fact that ~ 4 kMTs bind each chromosome in chicken and flies wherein the 26 centromeres are longer than 30 kb ( Figure S7A ) ( Ribeiro et al . 2009 ; Ribeiro et al . 2010 ; Shang et al . 2010 ) . 27 The dispensability of DSS in two phylogenetically distantly related species with longer centromeric 28 chromatin reinforces the proposed inverse correlation with centromere length . 29 Large centromeres are known to act as a buffer enabling harmless kinetochore drift across the 30 centromere to prevent functional interference of neighboring essential genes ( Fukagawa and Earnshaw 31 2014 ) . In this study , we uncover another potential advantage associated with regional centromeres in 32 18 tolerating conditions sub - optimal for chromosome segregation . This adaptive edge provided by regional 1 centromeres in enabling compensatory mechanisms may explain their recurring presence across Eukaryota 2 ( Figure S7B , Table S1 ) . Our results also highlight a significant role of centromere size / length in shaping 3 the evolution of Dam1 complex function and its physiological structure . This can be attributed to several 4 features such as the presence of excess CENPA nucleosomes , tethering multiple kMTs per chromosome , 5 and / or enabling multivalency of Ndc80 . The ring structure could be an evolutionarily selected conformation 6 that is indispensable for the attachment of chromosomes with point centromeres , a derived state that 7 provides a single attachment point to the MTs . Further investigations on the Dam1 complex in different 8 fungi will shed light on other functional assemblies beyond the Dam1 rings and their significance . 9 19 Materials and Methods 1 Media and growth conditions 2 S . cerevisiae , C . albicans , and C . neoformans strains used in this study were grown in YPD ( 2 % dextrose , 3 2 % peptone , 1 % yeast extract supplemented with 0 . 01 % adenine ) and incubated at 30°C at 180 rpm . 4 Conditional expression strains in S . cerevisiae were propagated in galactose media ( YPG , 2 % galactose , 5 0 . 3 % raffinose , 2 % peptone , 1 % yeast extract ) unless repression in YPD is mentioned . Transformation of 6 S . cerevisiae and C . albicans were performed by standard lithium acetate - PEG method ( Geitz and 7 Schiestel ( 2007 ) , Sanyal and Carbon ( 2002 ) ) . Biolistic transformation method was used for C . 8 neoformans strains ( Davidson et al . , 2000 ) . Selection of transformants was based on prototrophy for the 9 metabolic markers used . In case of antibiotic marker NAT , selection was done in media supplemented 10 with 100 μg / mL nourseothricin ( ClonNAT ; CAS 96736 - 11 - 7 , Werner Bioagents , Jena , Germany ) . For 11 cold sensitivity assays , the growth temperature was reduced to 18°C for C . albicans and 14°C for C . 12 neoformans . For thiabendazole sensitivity assay , the growth media was supplemented with indicated 13 concentration of Thiabendazole ( Sigma , 10mg / mL stock in dimethyl formamide ) . 14 Strains and plasmids 15 The list of all the strains , plasmids , and primers used are provided in Tables S2 , S3 , and S4 respectively . 16 The construction of each of them is detailed below . 17 Construction of S . cerevisiae strains 18 Construction of vectors to express Dad2 - GFP ( wildtype , mutated , or truncated form ) in pRS313 19 To express GFP tagged ScDad2 from pRS313 ( CEN / ARS / HIS1 plasmid ) , sequences coding for GFP 20 along with terminator sequences of ScACT1 was amplified using primer pair ScGFP - F / ScGFP - R and 21 cloned as a BamHI - ClaI fragment into pRS313 resulting in pRS313G . This plasmid was subsequently 22 used to clone Dad2 with / without mutations . For cloning ScDad2 - FL , a fragment containing ScDAD2pr - 23 DAD2 ORF was amplified from the genomic DNA of BY4741 strain with primers SR282 / SR290 and 24 cloned in frame with GFP as a SacII - BamHI fragment into pRS313G . The resulting plasmid was named 25 pSR01 . Since the DSS in ScDad2 is located near the stop codon , any desired mutation was incorporated 26 in the reverse primer used to amplify Dad2 . In this way , ScDad2 - R126A , ScDad2 - R128A , and 27 ScDad2ΔDSS were amplified with primer pairs SR289 / Sc126A - R , SR289 / Sc128A - R , and 28 SR289 / ScΔDSS - R respectively , and cloned into the SacII - BamHI sites of pRS313G . The resulting 29 plasmids were named pSR02 through pSR04 . Each of these constructs was confirmed by Sanger 30 sequencing using SR282 . 31 20 Construction of strains YSR01 through YSR05 1 A previously reported conditional mutant of ScDad2 ( CJY077 : MATa Δdad2 : : KanMX6 ura3‐52 lys2‐801 2 ade2 ‐101 trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1 : : pCJ055 ( dad2 ts , LEU2 ) his3Δ200 ) was used as the parent strain . The plasmids 3 pRS313G , pSR01 - pSR04 were used to transform the CJY077 strain by the standard lithium acetate 4 method to generate strains YSR01 through YSR05 respectively . Transformants were selected on CM - leu - 5 h is media upon incubation at 28˚C . Selected colonies from the transformation plate were streaked again 6 on CM - leu - his media for single colonies and used for subsequent experiments . 7 Construction of strains YSR06 through YSR12 8 The strain BY4741 was engineered to express Spc42 with mCherry tag at the C - terminus resulting in 9 YSR06 . The cassette was amplified from the plasmid pAW8 - mCherry using the primer pair S42F / S42R . 10 A Dad2 protection plasmid was constructed as follows . The Sc DAD2 gene with its promoter and 11 terminator was amplified using the primer pair ScDad2Pr F / ScDad2R and cloned as a SacII / SacI fragment 12 into pRS316 ( CEN / ARS / URA ) resulting in the plasmid pSR05 . The strain YSR06 was transformed with 13 the plasmid pSR05 by the standard lithium acetate method to generate strain YSR07 . The transformants 14 were selected on CM - ura media upon incubation at 30  C . 15 YSR07 cells grown on CM - URA media were then transformed with a cassette to delete DAD2 ORF with 16 a LEU marker . The cassette was amplified from the plasmid pUG73 using the primer pair 17 ScDad2delF / ScDad2delR . Since the deletion cassette can delete DAD2 from either the native locus or 18 from the plasmid , the desired transformants where the deletion occurred on the genomic DAD2 locus 19 were selected by their inability to grow on media containing 5’FOA . This strain was named YSR08 and 20 was further confirmed by PCR using the primer pair ScDad2F / Leu2R . Strains YSR09 - YSR12 were 21 subsequently generated by independently transforming YSR08 cells with plasmids pSR01 - pSR04 . The 22 transformants were selected on CM - ura - his media upon incubation at 30 ˚C . The strains YSR09 through 23 YSR12 were subsequently maintained in this media unless stated otherwise . 24 Construction of strains YSR13 through YSR17 25 A cassette to replace the native DAD2 promoter with the GAL 1 - 10 promoter was amplified with the primer 26 pairs GalDad2FP / GalDad2RP using pYM - N25 as the template . The PCR product was used to transform 27 the strain SBY12503 to obtain the conditional mutant strain YSR13 . The transformants were selected on 28 YPDU plates supplemented with 100 µg / mL norseothricin upon incubation at 30  C . 29 For integrating ScDad2 - FL , the ORF containing fragment was amplified using the primers Dad2pr - SacII - 30 F / Dad2pr - SacI - R . A reintegration cassette was generated by cloning the DAD2 ORF along with the 31 21 promoter in SacII / SacI sites into pUG73 resulting in pSR06 . To introduce mutations corresponding to 1 ScDad2 - R126A , ScDad2 - R128A , and ScDad2 - ΔDSS , the ORF containing fragments were constructed by 2 overlap PCR ( see list of primers ) . Each of these fragments were independtly cloned as SacII - SacI 3 fragment into pUG73 resulting in plasmids pSR07 ( ScDad2 - R126A in pUG73 ) , pSR08 ( ScDad2 - R128A 4 in pUG73 ) and pSR09 ( ScDad2 - ΔDSS in pUG73 ) . 5 Each of these plasmids pSR06 - pSR09 was linearized by digestion with SpeI and then used to transform 6 the conditional mutant strain YSR13 to obtain reintegrants YSR14 - YSR17 that respectively express 7 ScDad2 - FL , ScDad2 - R126A , ScDad2 - R128A , and ScDad2 - ΔDSS from the DAD2 promoter from the 8 native DAD2 locus . The transformants were selected on CM ( Gal ) - leu media upon incubation at 30  C . 9 Construction of C . albicans strains 10 Construction of strains J108A and J108B 11 A plasmid pBS - RN was constructed by amplifying the RPS1 locus using the primer pair RP10F / RP10R 12 and cloned as a NotI fragment into the pBS - NAT plasmid . A previously reported plasmid pDad2 - TAP 13 was used as a template to amplify wild - type full length DAD2 along with its promoter and a C - terminal 14 TAP tag using the primer pair AD02 / AD03 . The amplicon was cloned as a SalI fragment into pBS - RN 15 resulting in the plasmid pRN - Dad2 - FL . The DSS deleted version was generated by overlap PCR strategy 16 using the primer pairs AD02 / Dad2delR and Dad2delF / AD03 . The overlap product was cloned as a SalI 17 fragment into pBS - RN to obtain the plasmid pRN - Dad2 - ΔDSS . Both pRN - Dad2 - FL and pRN - Dad2 - 18 ΔDSS were used to transform the conditional dad2 mutant J108 after linearization with StuI . The 19 transformants were selected on YP - Succinate media supplemented with 200 µg / mL NAT . 20 Construction of strains ASR01 through ASR04 21 A previously reported plasmid pDad2Δ3 ( CaDAD2 deletion with a HIS1 marker ) was used to transform 22 SN148 after digestion with SacI - KpnI . The resulting heterozygous mutant of DAD2 was named ASR01 . 23 The vectors to incorporate desired mutations in the remaining DAD2 allele were constructed as follows . 24 Sequences 537 bp downstream of the DAD2 ORF was amplified using the primer pair Dad2DS - 25 F / Dad2DS - R and cloned as a XhoI / KpnI fragment into pBS - GFP - Ura plasmid . The resulting plasmid was 26 named pSR10 and was used to clone the other homology region containing DAD2 ORF with desired 27 mutations . In this regard , mutant version of DAD2 were generated by overlap PCR method as described 28 earlier and the product was cloned into pBS - RN resulting in plasmids pRN - 92 ( for CaDad2 - R92A ) . Along 29 with pRN - Dad2 - FL and pRN - Dad2 - ΔDSS these plasmids served as intermediate vectors from which 30 CaDAD2 ORF with the corresponding mutation was amplified using the primer pair Dad2FP / Dad2GFP - 31 22 RP . Each of these fragments were cloned as a SacII / SpeI fragment into pSR10 resulting in plasmids 1 pSR11 ( CaDad2 - FL ) , pSR12 ( CaDad2 - R92A ) , and pSR15 ( CaDad2 - ΔDSS ) . These plasmids were then 2 used to transform ASR01 after digestion with SacII - KpnI to result in strains ASR02 throughASR04 . The 3 transformants were selected in CM - uri media . The presence of desired mutations was confirmed by 4 Sanger sequencing using the primer Dad2cFP . 5 Construction of strains ASR07 through ASR09 6 To tag CENP - A with a TAP tag , a previously reported plasmid pCse4TAP - Leu ( Varshney and Sanyal , 7 2019 ) ) was linearized with XhoI and used the transform strains ASR02 through ASR04 to obtain the 8 strains ASR07 through ASR09 . The transformants were selected on CM - leu plates . Expression of the 9 fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblotting . 10 Construction of strains ASR12 through ASR14 11 A plasmid to tag Tub4 with mCherry was generated as follows . The 3’ part of the TUB4 gene was 12 released from a previously reported plasmid pTub4GFP - Ura as a SacII / SpeI fragment and cloned into 13 pDam1 - mCherryNAT at these sites , replacing DAM1 with TUB4 . The resulting plasmid pTub4 - 14 mCherryNAT was linearized by XbaI digestion and used to transform the strains ASR02 - 04 to obtain 15 ASR12 through ASR14 . The transformants were selected on YPD plates supplemented with 100 µg / mL 16 NAT . Transformants were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy . 17 Construction of ASR17 and ASR18 18 One allele of MAD2 in ASR03 ( CaDad2 - R92A ) and ASR04 ( CaDad2 - ΔDSS ) was deleted by 19 transformation with the plasmid pMad2 - 2 ( Thakur and Sanyal , 2011 ) after digestion by SacII - XhoI . The 20 resulting heterozygous MAD2 mutants were named ASR03M and ASR04M . The transformants were 21 selected on CM - leu plates . The remaining allele of MAD2 in ASR03M and ASR04M were deleted by 22 transformation with the plasmid pMad2 - 3 after digestion with BamHI - XhoI . The resulting mad2 mutants 23 from ASR03M and ASR04M were named ASR17 and ASR18 respectively . The transformants were 24 selected on CM - leu - arg plates . The strains were confirmed by PCR using primer pairs Mad2 - 1 / Mad2 - 2 25 and NV228 / NV229 . 26 Construction of strains ASR19 through ASR21 27 To tag Ndc80 with mCherry , a previously reported plasmid pNdc80 - mChARG ( Varshney and Sanyal , 28 2019 ) ) was linearized with XhoI and used the transform strains ASR02 through ASR04 to obtain the 29 strains ASR19 through ASR21 . The transformants were selected on CM - arg plates . Expression of the 30 fusion protein was confirmed by microscopy . 31 23 Construction of C . neoformans strains 1 Construction of strains CNSD169 through CNSD171 2 A 743 bp fragment that includes Dad2 promoter and the ORF was amplified by overlap PCR using the 3 primer pairs SD118 / SD119 and SD120 / VYP152 to introduce the mutation R102A in CnDad2 . By a 4 similar overlap PCR based strategy , DSS deleted version of CnDad2 was also amplified . A second 5 fragment containing mCherry tag along with a Neomycin marker was amplified from pLK25 using the 6 primer pairs VYP153 / VYP154 . The homology region corresponding to the DAD2 - 3’UTR was amplified 7 using VYP155 / VYP156 . These three fragments were subsequently fused by overlap PCR using the 8 primer pairs SD118 / VYP156 and used to transform the strain CNV108 by biolistic method . For the 9 control strain , the same overlap PCR strategy was used with the first homology region amplified without 10 any mutation using primer pairs SD118 / VYP152 . Transformants were selected by resistance to Neomycin 11 and were further confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing . 12 Construction of S . pombe strains 13 Construction of strains PSR01 and PSR02 14 The ORF of SpDad2 along with 534 bp of sequences upstream of Dad2 was amplified using the primer 15 pairs SpF / Sp - FL - R . A DSS deleted version of the same fragment was amplified using the primer pairs Sp - 16 F / Sp - del - R wherein the DSS deletion was introduced in the long primer . Both these primers were 17 designed to have overhangs to facilitate their recombination into the plasmid pVB128 such that the ORF 18 is in frame with the 3xFLAG tag from the plasmid . The resulting plasmids pSp - FL and pSp - del was then 19 linearized with Nhe1 and used for transformation of the S . pombe dad2 mutant strain SP1619 obtain the 20 strains PSR01 ( expressing SpDad2 - FL ) and PSR02 ( expressing SpDad2 -  DSS ) . Standard LiOAc - PEG 21 method was followed for the transformation and the transformants were selected by resistance to NAT . 22 Targeted integration was verified by a PCR using the primers Sp - cFP / FLAG - RP . 23 Identification of DSS 24 The HMM file for the Dad2 domain ( PF08654 ) was downloaded from the Pfam database page for this 25 domain . This model was used as the query to perform a HMMsearch ( hmmsearch search | HMMER 26 ( ebi . ac . uk ) ) routinely used to search for a HMM profile against a protein sequence database . The search 27 was targeted against fungal genomes using the option ‘Ensembl Genomes Fungi’ . The E - value cutoff for 28 the search was 0 . 01 by default . The first round of HMM search resulted in 912 hits from all the major 29 fungal subphyla ( Table S5 , Sheet - Hits _ Ensembl Fungi ) . The hits were manually curated to remove 30 duplicate entries of any given species for which multiple genome sequences were available . In addition to 31 24 this , hits from 9 species that were unusually long were also removed for subsequent analysis to avoid 1 alignment artifacts ( Table S5 , Sheet - long hits ) . This resulted in a final pool of 466 hits from which a 2 multiple sequence alignment was generated using MAFFT . Apart from the known Dad2 domain at the N - 3 terminus , the alignment revealed a second conserved domain Dad2 centered around a highly conserved 4 arginine . This 10aa - long domain was named DSS . The amino acid logo indicating the consensus sequence 5 of DSS ( in Figure 1A ) was generated with this multiple sequence alignment using Weblogo tool 6 ( WebLogo - Create Sequence Logos ( berkeley . edu ) ) . 7 Flow cytometry 8 Overnight grown cultures of S . cerevisiae or C . albicans were subcultured to 0 . 2 OD 600 in desired media / 9 growth condition as described for the experiment . Cells were harvested at various time intervals post - 10 inoculation . Harvested samples were fixed by dropwise addition of ice - cold 70 % ethanol , followed by 11 RNAse treatment and propidium iodide ( PI ) staining as described before ( Sanyal and Carbon , PNAS 12 2002 ) . Stained cells were diluted to the desired cell density in 1x PBS and analyzed ( 30 , 000 cells ) by 13 flow cytometry ( FACSAria III , BD Biosciences ) at a rate of 500 - 2000 events / s . The output was analyzed 14 using the FLOWJO software . The 561 - nm laser was used to excite PI and 610 / 20 filter to detect its 15 emission signals . 16 Fluorescence microscopy and analysis 17 Cells were grown in media and growth conditions as described for each experiment . Prior to imaging , the 18 cells were washed thoroughly with sterile water twice and resuspended in sterile water to achieve 19 optimum cell density for imaging . The cells were imaged in Zeiss Axio observer equipped with Colibri 7 20 as the LED light source , 100x Plan Apochromat 1 . 4 NA objective , and PCO edge 4 . 2 sCMOS camera . Z 21 sections were obtained at an interval of 300 nm . All the images were displayed after the maximum 22 intensity projection using ImageJ . For visualizing nuclear mass , S . cerevisiae and C . albicans cells were 23 stained with Hoechst ( 50 ng / mL ) prior to imaging . GFP and mCherry fluorescence were acquired using 24 the filter set 92 HE ( excitation 455 – 483 nm and emission 501 – 547 nm for GFP , and excitation 583 – 600 25 nm and emission 617 – 758 nm for mCherry ) . 26 Western blotting 27 Protein lysates for western blot were prepared by the TCA method . From overnight grown cultures , 28 3OD 600 equivalent cells were harvested , washed , and resuspended in 400 μL of 12 . 5 % ice cold TCA 29 solution . The suspension was vortexed briefly and stored at - 20°C for 12 h . The suspension was thawed 30 on ice , pelleted at 14000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with 350 μL of 80 % Acetone ( ice cold ) . The 31 25 washed pellets were air dried completely and resuspended in desired volume of lysis buffer ( 0 . 1N 1 NaOH + 1 % SDS ) . Rabbit anti - Protein A antibody ( P3775 , Sigma ) and the HRP conjugated Goat anti - 2 Rabbit secondary antibody , both were used at 1 : 5000 dilution in 2 . 5 % Skim Milk powder in 1XPBS . The 3 blots were developed using chemiluminescent substrate ( BioRad ) and imaged using Chemidoc system 4 ( BioRad ) 5 Expression and purification Dam1 complex 6 Plasmid construction 7 The plasmid co - expressing the ten S . cerevisiae Dam1 complex subunits with a C - terminal His6 - 8 tagged DAD1 was used to generate the mutant versions DASH R126A and DASH  DSS wherein the Dad2 9 ORF was mutated to encode Dad2 - R126A and Dad2 -  DSS . These changes were introduced as described 10 below . We identified two unique sites NruI and SnaBI that contained the sequences encoding Dad1 , the 11 Dad2 and the N terminal part of Spc19 . This fragment was amplified by overlap PCR using the primers 12 mentioned Table S4 such that the desired mutations were introduced in the Dad2 ORF . The resulting 13 amplicons digested and cloned into the NruI / SnaBI sites of the plasmid PC4 - Dad1H . The desired 14 mutations were verified by sequencing . 15 Expression and Purification 16 The recombinant wild - type and the mutant S . cerevisiae Dam1 complexes were expressed and 17 purified as described previously with some modifications ( Miranda et al . 2005 ; Westermann et al . 2006 ) . 18 Briefly , the recombinant vector plasmids were transformed into E . coli BL21Rosetta cells ( Novagen ) 19 harboring the pRARE plasmid ( Novagen ) . Super Broth media ( 3 L ) was inoculated with an overnight E . 20 coli bacterial culture and grown at 37  C till OD 600 reached 0 . 4 . The protein expression was induced by 21 the addition of 0 . 3 mM IPTG . Bacterial cells were harvested after 4 h induction , washed with ice - cold 22 PBS pH 7 . 5 , and resuspended in lysis buffer [ 50 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 35 mM 23 imidazole , and 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol ] . Cells were lysed by sonication ( 1s ON , 1s OFF , total 5 min , 24 40 % amplitude ) , and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 22 , 000 rpm at 6  C for 50 min . The 25 supernatant was incubated with pre - equilibrated Ni - NTA Agarose ( Qiagen ) beads under constant rotation 26 at 4  C for 2 h . Following incubation , beads were recovered by low - speed centrifugation at 500 g for 5 27 min , washed with 10 - column volumes of lysis buffer ( once ) , high - salt buffer [ twice , 50 mM sodium 28 phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 35 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP and 5 29 mM β - mercaptoethanol ] . The proteins were eluted by incubating with 40 mL of elution buffer [ 50 mM 30 sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 400 mM imidazole , and 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol ] and 31 dialyzed overnight against 2 L dialysis buffer [ 50 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 25 mM NaCl , 1mM 32 EDTA and 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol ] . The dialysate was subsequently loaded onto a pre - equilibrated 5 33 26 mL HiTRAP Q HP ( Cytiva ) ion exchange column , and the bound proteins were eluted in 3 mL fractions 1 by a linear gradient of 15 - 1000 mM NaCl . The fractions containing all the ten Dam1 complex subunits 2 were pooled , concentrated using a VIVASPIN 15R 10000 MWCO ( Sartorius ) centricon , and loaded to a 3 Superose 6 10 / 300 GL column ( Cytiva ) . The bound proteins were eluted with 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 500 4 mM NaCl 1 mM EDTA . The purified protein samples were concentrated to 1 mg / mL , resuspended to a 5 10 % glycerol , and stored in – 80  C as 100 µL aliquots until further use . 6 MT polymerization , cosedimentation , and electron microscopy 7 MT polymerization and cosedimentation assays were performed according to a previously reported 8 procedure ( Miranda et al . 2005 ) with minor modifications . Briefly , bovine tubulin ( Cytoskeletons Inc . ) 9 was polymerized at 5 mg / mL in 80 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 1mM GTP , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 100 10 µM paclitaxel at 35  C for 20 min . The paclitaxel - stabilized MTs were diluted 100 - fold in 25 mM 11 HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM GTP , and 10 µM paclitaxel . 12 MT - decoration with Dam1 complex : 13 The purified Dam1 complex aliquots were thawed on ice and precleared by centrifugation at 15 , 000 rpm 14 for 10 min at 4  C . About 20 µL of 1 mg / mL Dam1 complex was mixed with 180 µL of MT solution and 15 incubated for 20 min at room temperature . 16 For MT co - sedimentation assay , the Dam1 complex - MT reaction mix was gently layered onto 250 µL 17 cushion buffer ( 25 mM HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 50 % glycerol , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 µM 18 paclitaxel , 4mM DTT ) and centrifuged ( TLA 100 . 3 rotor ) at 80 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 25  C . The 19 supernatant ( top 150 µL ) and pellets ( resuspended in 220 µL 1x loading buffer ) were recovered and 20 analyzed on 15 % SDS - PAGE . Gels were stained with Coomassie solution , destained and photographed . 21 For visualization of Dam1 - MT decoration , 4 µL of Dam1 complex - MT reaction mix was adsorbed onto 22 a freshly glow - discharged ( 25 mA , 0 . 38 mbar , 60 s ) grid for 2 min , washed with 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 23 500 mM NaCl 1 mM EDTA buffer and stained with 0 . 7 % ( w / v ) uranyl formate . Micrographs of 24 negatively stained samples were captured using the Joel JEM1400 Plus TEM instrument ( University 25 of Edinburgh ) . 26 Statistical analysis 27 All graphs were generated and analyzed using Graphpad prism ( v8 ) . One - way ANOVA or paired t - test 28 with Welsch’s correction was used based on the sample size to test for the statistical significance of 29 acquired results using a p - value cut off of 0 . 05 . 30 Competing interest statement 31 The authors declare no competing interests . 32 27 Acknowledgment 1 We thank S .

The tolerance towards alanine substitution of the conserved arginine in the DSS is 4 dependent on the length of centromeric chromatin . ( A ) Summary of the alanine substitution mutant 5 phenotype across the three fungal species tested in this study . The length of centromeric chromatin of each 6 species is mentioned in the x - axis . The diminishing severity of the mutant phenotype in each of the species 7 studied is represented in the y - axis as the frequency of cells showing defective segregation in the form of 8 an unsegregated nuclear mass and / or a short mitotic spindle . Abbreviations in the x - axis indicate the 9 following : Sc , S . cerevisiae ; Ca , C . albicans ; and Cn , C . neoformans . ( B ) A model to explain the effect of 10 mutations in the DSS in organisms with point centromeres versus those with regional centromeres . The 11 kinetochore formed on a single CENPA nucleosome binds to a MT during chromosome segregation in 12 organisms with point centromeres . Mutations compromising the efficiency of this interaction can result in 13 viability loss . In the case of regional centromeres , represented by C . albicans , the centromeres possess 14 additional CENPA nucleosomes apart from the one that binds to a MT ( Joglekar et al . 2008 ; Burrack et al . 15 2011 ; Thakur and Sanyal 2011 ) . Cells that can recruit excess outer kinetochore proteins often enable 16 42 additional kMTs to bind to a chromosome facilitating chromosome segregation even with a mutant 1 kinetochore . The subset of cells unable to recruit excess kinetochore proteins / kMTs eventually lose 2 viability . The inherent property of C . neoformans centromeres to bind multiple microtubules as predicted 3 from the size of the centromeric chromatin is shown . This configuration makes the conserved arginine 4 residue in the DSS dispensable for viability in C . neoformans . ( C ) C . albicans strains ASR19 through 5 ASR21 , expressing indicated versions of Dad2 and Ndc80 - mCherry , were grown to log phase at 30  C , 6 washed , and observed under a fluorescence microscope .

Data from three experiments 8 covering > 350 kinetochore clusters were used to generate the violin plot . Black lines indicate mean and 9 dotted lines mark the quartiles . Statistical significance was tested by one - way ANOVA ( * * * * , p < 0 . 0001 ) . 10 Below each strain in the x - axis , a representative image for Ndc80 localization in each of them is shown . 11 Scale bar , 5 μm . 12
