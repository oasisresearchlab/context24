Comment www . thelancet . com / public - health Published online April 7 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S2468 - 2667 ( 20 ) 30084 - 0 1 COVID - 19 , school closures , and child poverty : a social crisis in the making While coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) continues to spread across the globe , many countries have decided to close schools as part of a physical distancing policy to slow transmission and ease the burden on health systems . The UN Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization estimates that 138 countries have closed schools nationwide , and several other countries have implemented regional or local closures . These school closures are affecting the education of 80 % of children worldwide . Although scientific debate is ongoing with regard to the effectiveness of school closures on virus transmission , 1 the fact that schools are closed for a long period of time could have detrimental social and health consequences for children living in poverty , and are likely to exacerbate existing inequalities . We discuss two mechanisms through which school closures will affect poor children in the USA and Europe . First , school closures will exacerbate food insecurity . For many students living in poverty , schools are not only a place for learning but also for eating healthily . Research shows that school lunch is associated with improvements in academic performance , whereas food insecurity ( including irregular or unhealthy diets ) is associated with low educational attainment and substantial risks to the physical health and mental wellbeing of children . 2 , 3 The number of children facing food insecurity is substantial . According to Eurostat , 6·6 % of households with children in the European Union—5·5 % in the UK — cannot afford a meal with meat , fish , or a vegetarian equivalent every second day . Comparable estimates in the USA suggest that 14 % of households with children had food insecurity in 2018 . 4 Second , research suggests that non - school factors are a primary source of inequalities in educational out - comes . The gap in mathematical and literacy skills between children from lower and higher socio economic backgrounds often widens during school holiday periods . 5 The summer holiday in most American schools is estimated to contribute to a loss in academic achievement equivalent to one month of education for children with low socioeconomic status ; however , this effect is not observed for children with higher socioeconomic status . 6 Summer holidays are also associated with a setback in mental health and wellbeing for children and adolescents . 7 Although the current school closures differ from summer holidays in that learning is expected to continue digitally , the closures are likely to widen the learning gap between children from lower - income and higher - income families . Children from low - income households live in conditions that make home schooling difficult . Online learning environments usually require computers and a reliable internet connection . In Europe , a substantial number of children live in homes in which they have no suitable place to do homework ( 5 % ) or have no access to the internet ( 6·9 % ) . Furthermore , 10·2 % of children live in homes that cannot be heated adequately , 7·2 % have no access to outdoor leisure facilities , and 5 % do not have access to books at the appropriate reading level . 8 In the USA , an estimated 2·5 % of students in public schools do not live in a stable residence . In New York city , where a large proportion of COVID - 19 cases in the USA have been observed , one in ten students were homeless or experienced severe housing instability during the previous school year . 9 While learning might continue unimpeded for children from higher income households , children from lower income households are likely to struggle to complete homework and online courses because of their precarious housing situations . Beyond the educational challenges , however , low - income families face an additional threat : the ongoing pandemic is expected to lead to a severe economic recession . Previous recessions have exacerbated levels of child poverty with long - lasting consequences for children’s health , wellbeing , and learning outcomes . 10 Policy makers , school administrators , and other local officials thus face two challenges . First , the immediate nutrition and learning needs of poor students must continue to be addressed . The continuation of school - provided meals is essential in preventing widespread food insecurity . Teachers should also consider how to adapt their learning materials for students without access to wireless internet , a computer , or a place to study . Second , local and national legislators must prepare for the considerable challenges that await when For more on UN Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization school closure estimates see https : / / en . unesco . org / covid19 / educationresponse Lancet Public Health 2020 Published Online April 7 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S2468 - 2667 ( 20 ) 30084 - 0 Comment 2 www . thelancet . com / public - health Published online April 7 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S2468 - 2667 ( 20 ) 30084 - 0 the pandemic subsides . At the local level , an adequate response must include targeted education and material support for children from low - income households to begin to close the learning gap that is likely to have occurred . From a policy perspective , legislators should consider providing regular income support for households with children during the impending economic crisis to prevent a deepening and broadening of child poverty . Without such action , the current health crisis could become a social crisis that will have long - lasting consequences for children in low - income families . We declare no competing interests .
