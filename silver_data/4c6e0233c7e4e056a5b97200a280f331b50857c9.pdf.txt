CME is shut down during early mitosis , but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear . In this study , we show that the mitotic shutdown is due to an unmet requirement for actin in CME . In mitotic cells , membrane tension is increased and this invokes a requirement for the actin cytoskeleton to assist the CME machinery to overcome the increased load . However , the actin cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rigid cortex in mitotic cells and is therefore unavailable for deployment . We demonstrate that CME can be ‘restarted’ in mitotic cells despite high membrane tension , by allowing actin to engage in endocytosis . Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins is maintained in mitotic cells with restored CME , indicating that direct phosphorylation of the CME machinery does not account for shutdown . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00829 . 001 Introduction Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , the major route of internalisation for transmembrane proteins into mammalian cells , controls many cellular processes from signalling and growth , to cell motility and organelle identity ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . It has been known for decades that CME , like many other cellular processes , is inhibited during the early stages of mitosis ( Fawcett , 1965 ; Berlin and Oliver , 1980 ; Warren , 1993 ; Fielding et al . , 2012 ; Fielding and Royle , 2013 ) . However , the mechanism that underlies this mitotic inhibition is unclear ( Fielding and Royle , 2013 ) . During CME , the cargo that is destined for internalisation is clustered into pits via interaction with adaptor proteins , which in turn , recruit clathrin triskelia . The forming clathrin - coated pit is then invaginated further and eventually pinched off in a process dependent on the GTPase dynamin . The actin cytoskeleton may assist in these latter stages of vesicle formation ( Robertson et al . , 2009 ) . CME is shut down shortly after prophase entry and resumes in late anaphase where it is required for membrane dynamics in cytokinesis ( Berlin and Oliver , 1980 ; Schweitzer et al . , 2005 ) . In early mitotic cells , shallow clathrin - coated pits are seen at the plasma membrane suggesting that invagination and subsequent steps of CME are inhibited ( Pypaert et al . , 1987 ) . Two main mechanisms have been proposed . First , direct mitotic phosphorylation of the CME machinery decreases its activity ( Pypaert et al . , 1991 ; Chen et al . , 1999 ; He et al . , 2003 ) . In support of this , numerous endocytic proteins are phosphorylated during mitosis ( Dephoure et al . , 2008 ) , but it is not clear what effect , if any , these modifications have on CME . Second , that the increased membrane tension of mitotic cells prevents invagination during CME ( Raucher and Sheetz , 1999 ) .

RESEARCH ARTICLE Cell biology Kaur et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e00829 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00829 2 of 17 Research article tension is increased in early mitosis ( Stewart et al . , 2011a ) in a process driven by osmotic changes ( Habela and Sontheimer , 2007 ; Stewart et al . , 2011b ) . The precise mechanism for shutdown is yet to be determined . Despite a clear role in yeast , the actin cytoskeleton does not have an obligatory role in CME in human cells ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Traub , 2011 ; Anitei and Hoflack , 2012 ) . Light and electron microscopy studies clearly show that it is recruited to a subset of CME events in human cells ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 , 2005 ; Collins et al . , 2011 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) and that it is important for internalisation of pathogens such as Listeria ( Bonazzi et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , the requirement for actin in CME may be linked to membrane tension . Recent work has shown that in cells where membrane tension is increased , there is an increased requirement for actin ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Stachowiak et al . , 2013 ) . During mitosis the plasma membrane tension is increased as a result of osmotic changes ( Raucher and Sheetz , 1999 ; Stewart et al . , 2011a ) , so why is the actin cytoskeleton not deployed to assist CME as occurs in interphase cells ? We set out to discover the mechanism for mitotic shutdown of CME . We found two methods to ‘restart’ CME in mitotic cells , which effectively rule out direct mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins as a mechanism for the mitotic shutdown of CME . Instead we propose that the actin machinery , which is engaged in assembling a stiff cortex in mitotic cells , is unavailable to rescue the inhibition caused by the increased membrane tension . This unmet requirement for actin in CME explains why endocytosis is inhibited in early mitosis . Results and discussion Membrane tension is elevated in mitotic cells Previous reports indicated that due to osmotic changes in mitosis , the plasma membrane tension is increased ( Raucher and Sheetz , 1999 ; Stewart et al . , 2011b ) . We began by verifying this observation in HeLa cells . To measure apparent membrane tension , a polystyrene bead coated with concanavalin A was held in an optical trap , attached to the plasma membrane , and then pulled away from the cell eLife digest The plasma membrane that surrounds a cell acts as a protective barrier that regulates what can enter or exit the cell . However , large molecules and other ‘cargo’ can get into a cell in a variety of ways . One of these routes—known as clathrin - mediated endocytosis—involves a receptor on the outside of the membrane grabbing hold of the cargo while a protein called clathrin forms a ‘pit’ beneath the receptor . This pit becomes deeper and deeper until the cargo is completely surrounded by clathrin - lined membrane and is brought inside the cell . This process has been studied over the past 50 years , and it is known that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is turned off when a cell begins to divide to produce new cells , and then turned back on when cell division has come to an end . However , there are competing theories as to exactly why this process stops when cell division starts . Now , Kaur et al . have investigated these theories by looking at the role that another protein , called actin , plays in turning off clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Actin is a molecule that forms a sort of scaffolding within the cell ( called the cytoskeleton ) , and it also guides the movement of molecules and larger structures within the cell . Further , when the cell membrane is being stretched , the actin cytoskeleton can assist the clathrin - mediated endocytosis machinery to pull cargo into the cell . So why doesn’t actin help with endocytosis during cell division ? The answer , Kaur et al . suggest , is that all the actin in the cell is needed by the cytoskeleton during cell division , so there is no actin available to perform other tasks such as clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Further experiments demonstrated that this form of endocytosis can be ‘restarted’ in dividing cells by treating the cells in a way that frees up some additional actin . The work of Kaur et al . also ruled out the theory that chemical changes to the endocytosis machinery disabled it during cell division . These findings have implications for the delivery of drugs , via endocytosis , to the rapidly dividing cells that are involved in diseases such as cancer .

The displacement of the bead from the trap centre is the tether force and this is proportional to the plasma membrane tension ( Figure 1A ) . We found that the tether force was increased from 19 . 2 ± 1 . 5 pN in interphase cells to 27 ± 2 . 8 pN in mitotic cells at metaphase ( mean ± SEM , p = 0 . 027 , Figure 1C ) . These measurements are in good agreement with previous measurements in other cell types ( Raucher and Sheetz , 1999 ) . Tether force is related to the force required to invaginate a clathrin - coated vesicle . This means that , in mitotic cells , comparatively more energy is required from the CME machinery as it tries to overcome an increased load . The shortfall in this energy may explain mitotic shutdown of CME and the question is : what is the molecular basis of this shortfall ? Differences between clathrin - coated structures in mitosis vs interphase Clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs , pits , and vesicles ) are present in mitotic cells with the pits being arrested at the cell surface in a shallow state ( Pypaert et al . , 1987 ) . Fluorescent transferrin binding to abundant transferrin receptors on the plasma membrane can be seen in these pits but the uptake of transferrin is prevented ( Figure 2A ; Fielding et al . , 2012 ) . Our hypothesis was that differences in the proteomes of CCSs purified from interphase or mitotic cells would explain why clathrin - coated pits are arrested at the surface . For example , components of the CME machinery that are regulated might be Figure 1 . Membrane tension in mitotic cells is elevated . ( A ) Schematic diagram to show the principle of using tether force to measure membrane tension . Displacement of the bead from the trap centre ( ∆ x ) can be converted to a tether force measurement ( pN ) as the stiffness of the trap is known . This tether force is proportional to the membrane tension . ( B ) Still video image of a membrane tension measurement in a mitotic cell . Note the thin tether is formed by moving the cell away from the bead held in the trap . ( C ) A typical trace showing bead displacement from the trap centre and the tether force .

To identify such differences , we prepared fractions enriched in CCSs from interphase or mitotic HeLa cells , according to established methods ( Borner et al . , 2006 , 2012 ) . These fractions were analysed by mass spectrometry and label - free quantitation ( Figure 2B ) . Over four independent experiments , we compared the relative abundance of 1253 proteins , only a subset of which are confirmed CCS proteins ( Borner et al . , 2006 , 2012 ) . The list of all abundances was used to characterise the variance of the dataset and identify outliers ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . We found that cortactin was the protein most consistently reduced in mitotic Figure 2 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00829 5 of 17 Research article CCSs compared to interphase ( LFQ intensity ratio = 46 . 2 ) . Cortactin is an activator of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerisation . A list of bona fide CCS proteins ( Borner et al . , 2012 ) was therefore supplemented with components of the actin cytoskeleton that are recruited to CCSs ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . The relative abundance of these proteins is shown in Figure 2C . These data show that most of the core CME machinery is not altered significantly between CCS - containing fractions from interphase and mitotic samples . Consistent with previous results ( Chetrit et al . , 2011 ; Kozik et al . , 2013 ) , Dab2 was less abundant and PICALM more abundant in mitotic fractions . HIP1 and HIP1R appeared to be differentially regulated . These two proteins link the clathrin machinery with the actin cytoskel - eton and are regulated by binding clathrin light chain ( Le Clainche et al . , 2007 ; Wilbur et al . , 2008 ) . The accumulation of HIP1R and the absence of cortactin in mitotic fractions were interesting , given that these two proteins have been shown previously to be coupled functionally ( Le Clainche et al . , 2007 ) . Other interesting differences , to be explored in the future , included the accumulation of NSF ( N - Ethylmaleimide - Sensitive Factor ) in mitotic CCSs ( LFQ intensity ratio = 0 . 077 ) . We next verified the comparative proteomics results by visualising the co - localisation of clathrin with HIP1R , HIP1 , and cortactin in interphase and mitotic cells . All three proteins were colocalised at least partially with clathrin in interphase CCSs . In mitotic cells , HIP1R was found tightly associated with clathrin - coated pits at the cell surface ( Figure 2D ) . By contrast , HIP1 and cortactin were diffusely localised in mitotic cells and were lost from CCSs ( Figure 2D ) . These results indicate that the actin cytoskeleton is important for the mitotic shutdown of CME . Taken together , this suggested the following mechanism : it is predicted that actin is required to assist CME in mitotic cells due to the increase in membrane tension ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . If the actin cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a stiff mitotic cortex ( Bray and White , 1988 ; Cramer and Mitchison , 1997 ; Stewart et al . , 2011a ) , perhaps it is unavailable to assist CME in mitotic cells ? ‘Restarting’ CME in mitotic cells : Ect2 depletion To test this idea , we developed two strategies to ‘restart’ CME in mitotic cells . Both methods work by allowing the actin cytoskeleton to engage in CME in mitotic cells . Our first strategy was to deplete Ect2 , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor effector for RhoA . Mitotic cells depleted of Ect2 showed similar CME to control cells in interphase ( Figure 3A ) . Quantification of transferrin uptake demonstrated that with either of two independent siRNAs against Ect2 , the mitotic shutdown of CME was reversed ( Figure 3A – C ) . Furthermore , this reversal could itself be blocked by the expression of siRNA - resistant GFP - Ect2 constructs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . These experiments show that restoration of CME following Ect2 RNAi is specifically due to loss of Ect2 protein and not due to an off - target effect . It was described previously that Ect2 - depletion inhibits the formation of the stiff actin cortex in mitotic cells ( Matthews et al . , 2012 ) . We therefore assessed actin availability to see if this was altered by Ect2 depletion . In mitotic cells depleted of Ect2 , the ratio of F - actin fluorescence at the cell cortex vs the cytoplasm was reduced compared with control RNAi cells ( Figure 3D , E ) . Analysis of cytosolic G - actin , visualised by DNase I staining ( Cramer et al . , 2002 ) revealed small but significant increases in the level of G - actin in mitotic cells depleted of Ect2 compared with control RNAi cells ( Figure 3F ) . These observations suggest that Ect2 depletion increases the availability of actin because the cortical F - actin is not efficiently remodelled into a cortex . We next measured the membrane tension of mitotic cells following depletion of Ect2 . The relative tether force in mitotic cells depleted of Ect2 was not significantly different from control RNAi mitotic cells ( 1 . 02 ± 0 . 15 , mean ± SEM , p = 0 . 921 , Student’s t test ) ( Figure 3G ) . This ruled out the possibility that actin cytoskeleton changes in Ect2 - depletion indirectly decrease membrane tension and therefore restore CME in mitotic cells . The measurement shows that membrane tension remains high in mitotic Ect2 - depleted cells . Is the restored CME in Ect2 - depleted mitotic cells actin - dependent ? To test this possibility , we treated cells with latrunculin B ( 1 µM ) , a toxin that promotes actin disassembly . We found that restored CME in Ect2 - depleted mitotic cells was sensitive to latrunculin B , whereas CME in interphase was not ( Figure 3H ) . Note that there was no evidence of restarting CME in control mitotic cells treated with latrunculin B ( Figure 3H ) . This argues against the possibility that the remodelled actin cortex in mitotic cells directly inhibits CME , as its destruction by the drug did not result in endocytosis . These experiments show that restored CME in mitotic cells is different to CME in interphase cells : it is strictly actin - dependent . Cell biology Kaur et al . eLife 2014 ; 3 : e00829 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00829 7 of 17 Research article Together our data demonstrate that the actin cytoskeleton is required for CME in the face of increased membrane tension during mitosis . ‘Restarting’ CME in mitotic cells : Rap1 activity Our second strategy to ‘restart’ CME in mitotic cells was to use a constitutively - active form of the small GTPase Rap1 , Rap1 ( Q63E ) ( Dao et al . , 2009 ) . Rap1 is an activator of β 1 - , β 2 - or β 3 - containing integrins that connect to the actin cytoskeleton ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . At mitosis onset , Rap1 is normally inactivated , allowing the disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibres , resulting in cell rounding ( Dao et al . , 2009 ) . Expression of Rap1 ( Q63E ) , but not the inactive mutant Rap1 ( S17A ) , causes mitotic cells to remain flat and unable to form a rounded actin cortex ( Figure 4A ; Dao et al . , 2009 ) . Measurement of the ratio of F - actin fluorescence at the cell cortex vs the cytoplasm showed a decrease in Rap1 ( Q63E ) - expressing cells relative to controls ( Figure 4B ) . The inhibition of cortex formation resulted in ∼ 20 % more G - actin to be available in mitotic cells expressing Rap1 ( Q63E ) compared with control mitotic cells ( Figure 4C ) . Moreover , membrane tension remained high in mitotic cells expressing Rap1 ( Q63E ) ( Figure 4D ) . The relative tether force was 1 . 15 ± 0 . 08 ( mean ± SEM , p = 0 . 21 , Student’s t test ) . These results indicate that , as with Ect2 depletion , the membrane tension remains high but the prevention of F - actin remodelling in mitosis has resulted in more actin becoming available to assist CME . To test if this manipulation also ‘restarts’ CME in mitotic cells , we next measured uptake of fluores - cent transferrin . We found that mitotic cells expressing Rap1 ( Q63E ) exhibited good transferrin uptake and this was comparable to the amount seen in interphase cells ( Figure 4E , F ) . We next investigated the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in restored CME in Rap1 ( Q63E ) - expressing cells . To do this , we depleted cortactin using RNAi ( Figure 4E , F ) . Depletion of cortactin blocked the restored CME in Rap1 ( Q63E ) - expressing cells ( Figure 4E , F ) . This is in contrast to inter - phase cells where depletion of cortactin had no effect on CME as measured by transferrin uptake ( Figure 4E , F ) . The cortactin - dependence of restored CME in Rap1 ( Q63E ) - expressing cells was not due to an off - target effect of RNAi . First , it could be demonstrated with two different siRNAs ( Figure 4E , F ) . Second , the effect could be rescued by expression of an siRNA resistant form of cortactin in Rap1 ( Q63E ) - expressing cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . This demonstrates that ‘restarted’ CME in mitotic cells is different from CME in interphase : it is dependent on cortactin , a protein that was lost from mitotic CCSs in our proteomic analysis ( Figure 2 ) . This indicated that using Rap1 ( Q63E ) expression to restart CME in mitotic cells and then inhibiting the restored CME using cortactin depletion , is analogous to the approach above using Ect2 RNAi and latrunculin B . Inhibition of actin function by latrunculin B or cortactin RNAi demonstrate that CME in mitotic cells requires actin and that Ect2 RNAi or Rap1 ( Q63E ) - expression permit the utilisation of actin to restore CME . Both strategies to restart mitotic CME support a model where an unmet requirement for actin in CME due to increased membrane tension , causes shutdown . Does ‘restarted’ CME in mitotic cells represent global restoration of CME , or is it specific to CME of the transferrin receptor ? To explore this question , we tested for restoration of internalisation of the three main endocytic motifs YXX Φ , [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] , and FXNPXY using the CD8 reporter system ( prometaphase ) cells as quantified by confocal microscopy .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00829 9 of 17 Research article ( Kozik et al . , 2010 ; Fielding et al . , 2012 ) . Confocal imaging of the steady - state distribution of CD8 chimeras in control mitotic cells showed no intracellular puncta and all CD8 reporters local - ised at the plasma membrane ( Figure 5 ) . In mitotic cells expressing Rap1 ( Q63E ) , there were numerous intracellular puncta consistent with CME of CD8 chimeras possessing any of the three main endocytic motifs ( Figure 5A ) . Note that this assay of endocytosis does not involve tempera - ture shifts , chemical synchronisation or serum starvation , which have been proposed to affect CME ( Tacheva - Grigorova et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , endocytosis of CD8 chimeras as measured by anti - body labelling on live cells using a fluorophore - conjugated anti - CD8 antibody confirmed that uptake of CD8 chimeras with endocytic motifs occurred in Rap1 ( Q63E ) expressing mitotic cells ( Figure 5B ) . Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins does not account for mitotic shutdown of CME An alternative explanation for CME shutdown in mitosis is the phosphorylation of endocytic proteins by mitotic kinases ( Pypaert et al . , 1991 ; Chen et al . , 1999 ; Fielding and Royle , 2013 ) . Our observa - tions , that mitotic cells are competent for CME if the actin cytoskeleton is made available , runs counter to this hypothesis . We first tested if mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins was maintained in cells with restored CME . We analysed the phosphorylation status of Dab2 by western blotting . Dab2 is a clathrin adaptor for cargo proteins with an NPXY endocytic motif ( Mishra et al . , 2002 ) and it is known to be phosphorylated in mitosis ( He et al . , 2003 ; Chetrit et al . , 2011 ) . Figure 6A shows that Dab2 is phosphorylated in mitosis and that this phosphorylation can be reversed by brief treatment of mitotic cells with the Cdk1 inhibitor flavopiridol ( 5 µM , 10 min ) ( Losiewicz et al . , 1994 ) . An identical situation was seen in lysates from cells expressing GFP - Rap1 ( Q63E ) ( Figure 6A ) . This suggests that CME of proteins with NPXY motifs can occur ( Figure 5 ) despite maintained mitotic phosphorylation of Dab2 by Cdk1 . Secondly , we tested whether inhibition of Cdk1 was sufficient to restart CME . Such restarting would be expected if mitotic phosphorylation inhibited the CME machinery directly . To do this , CME was measured using transferrin uptake and flow cytometry . The brief incubation of mitotic cells with flavopiridol ( 5 or 10 µM ) did not restart CME . Together , these results indicate that the direct mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins cannot account for mitotic shut down of CME . It remains possible that phosphorylation of endocytic proteins may have a more minor , modulatory role in mitotic shutdown of CME , but we found no evidence that phosphorylation of the CME machinery renders it inactive . Moreover , it should be noted that cyclin B1 - Cdk1 activity orchestrates mitosis and therefore drives the changes that result in the inhibition of CME at a higher level . We set out to describe the mechanism by which cells shut down CME during early mitosis . Membrane tension is elevated in mitotic cells and presents a challenge to the CME machinery : it now requires the assistance of actin to overcome this tension and internalise receptors . A proteomic survey revealed a comparative loss of cortactin from mitotic CCSs , implicating the actin cytoskeleton as being key to the inhibition . We showed that mitotic shutdown of CME can be cancelled either by the loss of Ect2 or by constitutive activation of Rap1 , two manipulations that increase actin availability by affecting the formation of a rounded actin cortex in mitotic cells . Restored CME under these conditions was uniquely sensitive to latrunculin B - treatment or cortactin - depletion , respectively . This agrees with the idea that the actin cytoskeleton is required for CME in mitotic cells , but it is normally unavailable due to the formation of the cortex . The unmet actin requirement for CME in mitosis is shown schematically in Figure 7 . The mechanism for mitotic shut down of CME can therefore be thought of as a ‘two layer’ inhibition . The first layer of inhibition comes from an increase in membrane tension , mainly due to osmotic ( G ) for each condition as indicated . N cell = 10 – 29 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00829 11 of 17 Research article changes in mitotic cells ( Raucher and Sheetz , 1999 ; Stewart et al . , 2011a ) . In interphase cells , CME can overcome such increases in membrane tension by recruiting the actin cytoskeleton to assist in force production ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . However , in mitotic cells , the cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rounded actin cortex and is thus unavailable to assist the CME machinery . This lack of actin availability represents a second layer of inhibition . Local nucleation of actin could therefore provide an override mechanism for receptor internalisation in mitotic cells . Recently , F - actin - dependent internalisation of the EGF receptor has been described ( Vehlow et al . , 2013 ) and this may explain how the EGF receptor can be internal - ised in mitotic cells albeit with delayed kinetics ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . An interesting question for the future is how the CME machinery senses increased membrane tension in order to engage the actin cytoskeleton . Materials and methods Molecular biology Plasmids for expression of mCherry - tagged mouse CTTN ( ID27676 ) and mouse HIP1R tagged with tDimer - RFP ( ID27700 ) were from Addgene . HIP1 tagged at the N - terminus with tdTomato was a kind gift from Uri Ashery ( Tel Aviv University ) . GFP - tagged clathrin light chain a ( GFP - LCa ) was available from previous work ( Royle et al . , 2005 ) . GFP - tagged Human Ect2 ( isoform 2 ) and Rap1 plasmids , pRK5 - Rap1 - Q63E and pRK5 - Rap1 - S17A were kind gifts from Buzz Baum ( MRC - LMCB , London , UK ) ( Dao et al . , 2009 ) . For Ect2 rescue experiments , siRNA resistant forms of GFP - Ect2 were made introducing silent mutations in the Ect2 siRNA target regions by site - directed muta - genesis . GFP - Rap1Q63E was constructed by diges - tion of pRK5 - Rap1Q63E with EcoRI and ligation into pEGFP - C3 . Rap1 constructs were expressed for 42 hr . The following siRNAs were used : CTTN ( QIAGEN , UK Hs _ CTTN _ 5 SI02661960 or Hs _ CTTN _ 6 SI02662485 ) , Ect2 ( QIAGEN , Hs _ ECT2 _ 5 SI02643067 or Hs _ ECT2 _ 6 SI03049249 ) at 100 nM for ∼ 66 hr or 42 hr , respectively . Cell culture and transfections HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and 100 U / ml penicillin - streptomycin at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 . DNA transfections were performed with GeneJuice ( MerckMillipore , UK ) and siRNA transfections with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies , UK ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . For transferrin uptake analysis , HeLa cells were serum - starved in DMEM for 30 min at 37°C before Alexa - conjugated transferrin ( 50 µg / ml ) was added ( B ) Representative fluorescence micrographs of anti - CD8 antibody uptake experiments . Control and Rap1 ( Q63E ) - expressing HeLa cells in mitosis are shown that express the indicated CD8 chimera . Uptake was performed as previously described ( Fielding et al . , 2012 ) .

The cells were incubated for 7 min at 37°C to allow uptake and then placed on ice to halt endocytosis . Two acid - washes ( 100 mM Glycine , 150 mM NaCl in PBS , pH 3 ) were performed on ice for 5 min to remove surface - bound transferrin . Additionally , the cells were washed with PBS before and after each acid - wash to reduce surface binding of transferrin . Latrunculin B ( 1 µM ) was added in serum - free media during the serum - starvation step of the transferrin uptake assay . For hypertonic sucrose treatment , sucrose ( 0 . 45 M ) was added after 15 min of serum starvation . Immunostaining HeLa cells were fixed with 3 % paraforamaldehyde / 4 % sucrose in PBS ( wt / vol ) for 15 min , permeabilised with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ( vol / vol ) for 10 min , and then blocked for 30 min with 3 % ( wt / vol ) BSA , 5 % ( vol / vol ) goat serum in PBS . Primary antibodies ( anti - CTTN , ab81208 ; Abcam , UK ) were incubated for 2 hr in blocking solution . After washing , secondary antibodies ( anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor568 , 1 : 500 ) were added for 1 hr . Finally , after washing with PBS , the cells were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade or Mowiol containing 10 μ g / ml 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) . Optionally , TRITC - phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) was added at a 1 : 2000 dilution for 1 hr after the permeabilisation step . CD8 live - labelling immunofluorescence experiments were carried out exactly as described previ - ously ( Fielding et al . , 2012 ) . For total CD8 immunostaining fixed cells were stained with anti - human CD8 Alexa488 - conjugated antibody ( 1 : 200 ; MCA1226A488 ; Serotec , UK ) with no secondary antibody . To assess the distribution of G - actin and F - actin , the DNase I / phalloidin method was used ( Cramer et al . , 2002 ) . Briefly , the cells were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde ( EM grade ) with 0 . 32 M sucrose in cytoskeleton buffer ( in mM : 10 Mes , 138 KCl , 3 MgCl 2 , 4 EDTA , pH 6 . 1 ) for 20 min at room temperature . The cells were permeabilised and then blocked for 20 min at room temperature . Cover slips were incubated with 0 . 3 µM DNaseI - Alexa488 and 1 : 2000 Phalloidin - TRITC , for 20 min Figure 7 . Model to show ‘two layer’ inhibition of CME during early mitosis . In interphase , CME is continually active and can deploy actin to assist endocytosis if the membrane tension is increased . The forces of CME , actin and membrane tension are represented as green , red and blue arrows , respectively . In mitosis , the membrane tension is increased and actin is required to assist CME , but it is also unavailable due to the formation of the actin cortex . Increasing actin availability , either by Ect2 - depletion or expression of Rap1 ( Q63E ) , can restore CME in mitotic cells . The membrane tension remains high , but actin is available to assist CME by providing additional force . If the actin cytoskeleton is considered to be a component of the endocytic machinery then its unavailability can be regarded as being due to a ‘moonlighting’ function in the formation of a rounded cortex ( Royle , 2013 ) .

The cover slips were washed three times in PBS with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and then mounted as above . Clathrin - coated structure proteomics The purification of fractions containing clathrin - coated structures was as described previously ( Borner et al . , 2012 ) . HeLa cells were plated onto 245 - mm square cell culture plates ( ∼ 2 million cells / plate ) . Mitotic cells were synchronised by 24 hr in thymidine ( 2 mM ) , released for 3 hr and then 16 hr in noco - dazole ( 100 ng / ml ) . This arrested ∼ 80 % of cells in mitosis and nine plates of mitotic cells were prepared vs seven plates for interphase . Mitotic cells were harvested 6 days after plating by shake - off collected by centrifugation , supernatant removed and cells were resuspended in Buffer A ( 0 . 1 M MES , pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 , 0 . 2 mM PMSF ) . Interphase cells were grown without synchronisation and were rinsed in Buffer A and scraped into Buffer A using a rubber policeman . The cells were lysed by 20 strokes in glass homogeniser ( Kontes # 22 ) and centrifuged at 152000 g av for 30 min at 4°C . Supernatant was removed to ice and 5 mg / ml RNAse A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added for 1 hr then centrifuged at 99 , 000 g av for 40 min at 4°C . Pellet was resuspended in 0 . 75 ml Buffer A and an equal volume of 12 . 5 % Ficoll / 12 . 5 % sucrose was added and mixed in microfuge tubes and then centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C in Eppendorf 5417R . Supernatant was removed , placed in thick - walled centrifuge tubes , mixed with 4 vol of Buffer A and clathrin - coated structures were pel - leted by spinning at 121500 g av for 75 min at 4°C . Supernatant was removed and pellets resuspended in 20 µl Buffer A . The protein content was tested by BCA assay and equal amounts of interphase and mitotic samples ( 25 – 50 µg ) were run on 4 – 12 % gradient NuPAGE gels and stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain ( Invitrogen ) . Each lane was cut into 32 slices and then digested with trypsin . The resulting tryptic peptide mixtures in 0 . 05 % trifluoracetic acid were analyzed by nanoACQUITY UPLC system ( Waters , UK ) , coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer with a Proxeon nano - electrospray source . A 5 μ l sample of the digest was injected into a BEH - C18 symmetry trapping column ( Waters ) in 0 . 1 % formic acid at 15 μ l / min before being resolved on a 25 cm × 75 μ m BEH - C18 column ( Waters ) , in a 1 – 62 . 5 % acetonitrile gradient in 0 . 1 % formic acid , with a flow rate of 400 nl / min . Full scan MS spectra ( m / z 300 – 2000 ) were generated at 30 , 000 resolution , and the top five most intense ions were fragmented and subjected to MS / MS in the linear quadrapole ion trap . Ions were fragmented using collision - induced dissociation ( collision energy 35 % , 30 ms ) . All spectra were acquired using Xcalibur software ( version 2 . 0 . 7 ) . RAW files were analysed using MaxQuant version 1 . 2 . 7 . 4 and searched against the Human IPI database , v . 3 . 77 . The proteingroups . txt file from a combined MaxQuant analysis of all four experimental runs was used to calculate the interphase / mitotic ratio of LFQ values for each protein ( Waanders et al . , 2009 ) . A Log2 transformation of each ratio was taken and used to construct a frequency histogram to which a Gaussian function was fitted to find the mean and variance of the entire dataset , and identify outliers ( µ ± 2 σ ) . MaxQuant detected the same outliers when each exper - iment was analysed individually . Excluded from the graph are proteins whose LFQ value for either interphase or mitosis was 0 . This could be due to total loss of the protein or poor detection . The fol - lowing proteins had large LFQ scores ( > 1 × 10 6 ) in one sample but 0 in the other and may therefore represent genuine CCS proteins that are only present in interphase ( EPN1 , HEXB , CTSC , NUMB ) or in mitosis ( CFL2 , CLTCL1 ) . Western blotting HeLa cells transfected to express GFP or GFP - Rap1Q63E were synchronised with 100 ng / ml noco - dazole for 16 hr at 37°C . Flavopiridol ( 5 µM ) was added for 10 min immediately prior to lysis in RIPA buffer supplemented with PMSF ( 0 . 2 mM ) , NaF ( 30 mM ) , and okadaic acid ( 100 nM ) . Lysates were analysed by SDS - PAGE and western blotting . Commercially available antibodies were used to Dab2 ( sc - 13982 ; Santa Cruz / Insight Biotech , UK ) , cyclinB1 ( 554179 ; BD Biosciences , UK ) , cdk1 ( ab18 ; Abcam ) , β - tubulin ( ab6046 ; Abcam ) , Ect2 ( SC - 1005 ; Santa Cruz ) . Microscopy Confocal imaging was done using a Leica confocal microscope SP2 with a 63X ( 1 . 4 NA ) oil - immersion objective , as described previously ( Fielding et al . , 2012 ) ; or using a Perkin – Elmer UltraView spinning disk confocal microscope system using 405 , 488 and 561 nm lasers and two Orca - R2 cameras ( Hamamatsu ) under the control of Volocity software ( Perkin – Elmer ) . Epifluorescence images were taken using a Nikon - Ti Eclipse microscope with a 60X ( 1 . 4 NA ) oil - immersion objective , DS - Qi1Mc camera and standard filter sets for visualisation of DAPI , GFP and Alexa568 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00829 14 of 17 Research article Optical trapping HeLa cells ( 400 µl at 5 × 10 5 cells / ml ) were plated onto 22 × 50 mm glass cover slips ( thickness 1 . 5 ) . Each cover slip was suspended on blu tac pedestals inside a 10 - cm petri dish alongside a 35 - mm petri dish with no lid that contained 3 ml DMEM to humidify the larger dish . After 6 hr , 800 µl full DMEM was added to the cells and incubated overnight . This ensured good attachment of cells and a clean , dry surface on the underside of the glass . Polybead carboxylate 1 µm microspheres ( Polysciences / Park Scientific , UK ) were coated with con - canavalin A using a Polylink protein coupling kit . This gave 20 µg of protein per 1 mg of microparticle . For trapping experiments , the bead solution was diluted ( 1 : 20 ) in full DMEM . A microchamber was created by sealing a small cover glass over the slide on which the cells were grown using high vacuum grease ( Apiezon ) . Bead suspension ( 10 µl ) was introduced by capillary action and the microchamber was mounted onto a custom - made optical trap microscope , described elsewhere ( Carter and Cross , 2005 ) . The stiffness of the optical trap was calibrated for each experiment , typically ∼ 0 . 3 pN / nm . A single bead was captured and held on the cell surface at a distance of 4 – 8 µm from the substrate , for several seconds . The bead was then pulled away , forming a membrane tether ( > 10 µm length ) , by moving the microscope stage under computer control at a constant velocity . The displacement of the bead in the optical trap ( and thus tether force ) was measured using a quadrant detector at 5 – 20 kHz . Once the displacement was established , the cell was moved back towards the bead faster than the tether recovery rate to provide a zero force reference ( see Figure 1C ) . The cell was then moved back away and tether force was re - established . Tension values were taken from a 1 s averaged before stage manip - ulation . All measurements were taken less than 30 s after tether formation , because actin polymerisation into the tether introduced inconsistent measurements in older tethers . Measurements from multiple tethers pulled from the same cell indicated high reproducibility and showed that a single force meas - urement was representative of the membrane tension of that cell . Occasionally , double tethers visible in DIC were pulled by a single bead and these gave a twofold increase in tether force from the same cell . Data from double tethers were not included here . Flow cytometry As previously described ( Fielding et al . , 2012 ) , mitotic cells were synchronised with 100 ng / ml nocodazole for 18 hr and harvested by shake - off . Interphase cells were growing asynchronously and harvested by trypsinisation . The cells were spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in serum free DMEM , and this step was repeated . For the mitotic samples , 100 ng / ml nocodazole was added to prevent progression through mitosis . After 20 min of incubation at 37°C , flavopiridol was added for a further 10 min at 37°C . The cells were moved to ice for 2 min then Alexa488 - conjugated transferrin ( 50 µg / ml dilution ) added on ice for 5 min . Uptake was allowed for 7 min at 37°C . Then , the cells were pelleted , resuspended in acid wash buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min . After a second acid wash , the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 % ( wt / vol ) BSA / PBS . Finally , the samples were analysed by flow cytometry ( FACSCalibur ; Becton Dickinson ) . The forward scatter channel ( FSC ) was gated at 200 in order to exclude all particles smaller than cells from analysis . The side scatter channel ( SSC ) was adjusted to 320 V and the fluorescent channel ( FL1 ) to 385 V . The geometric mean of FL1 was used for the graphs . Data analysis Transferrin uptake quantification was performed in ImageJ using confocal images , as previously described ( Fielding et al . , 2012 ) . For quantification of G - actin and F - actin fluorescence , a 24 pixel wide ROI was created at the cell border using a confocal z - section taken at the cell equator . A second ROI was created by placing a 50 × 50 ROI in the cytoplasm . The background - subtracted values were used to calculate the mean G - actin signal in the cytoplasm and a ratio of cortex / cytoplasm ratio for F - actin . All analysis , plots and statistical testing ( see legends for details ) were done in IgorPro 6 . 32A ( WaveMetrics ) . Figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS5 . 1 .
