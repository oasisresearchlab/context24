3285 Commentary Introduction Mechanical forces have long been implicated in regulating many physiologic and pathologic processes . Mechanical loading induces hypertrophy and strengthening of skeletal muscles , tendons , ligaments and bones , whereas prolonged exposure to weightlessness left early astronauts prone to fractures ( Burkholder , 2007 ; Duncan and Turner , 1995 ; Hattner and McMillan , 1968 ) . Similar hypertrophic thickening occurs in the heart with unchecked hypertension , although in this case resulting in potentially dangerous consequences ( Weber et al . , 1989 ; Westerhof and O’Rourke , 1995 ) . More subtly , differences in flow - induced shear stress in veins versus arteries specify the endothelium in part to take on a venous versus arterial phenotype , and the distribution of shear stresses within the arterial tree renders certain regions susceptible to inflammation , explaining the observed distribution of atherosclerotic plaques ( Davies et al . , 1995 ; Garcia - Cardena et al . , 2001 ) . Such examples span a wide range of mechanical settings ( see Box 1 for terminology ) and traditionally have provided the primary motivation for the study of mechanotransduction , or how forces are transduced into biochemical and functional responses . Recent studies also implicate forces that are generated by the contractile activity – or contractility – of cells in regulating cell function , and suggest a much broader role for mechanotransduction in biology . It has long been suggested that mechanical forces that are generated by the contractile activity of cells contribute to the physical folding , extension and cavitation events that are associated with morphogenesis ( Odell et al . , 1981 ; Keller et al . , 2003 ; His , 1874 ; Kiehart et al . , 2000 ; Moore et al . , 2005 ) . The existence of such forces was first demonstrated by the ability of adherent cells to wrinkle thin films of silicone elastomers ( Harris et al . , 1980 ) , as well as to drive matrix reorganization ( Stopak and Harris , 1982 ) , and have since been quantified using a variety of more advanced approaches ( Oliver et al . , 1995 ; Dembo and Wang , 1999 ; Galbraith and Sheetz , 1997 ; Balaban et al . , 2001 ; Tan et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , these forces appear not only to drive physical changes in the developing embryo , but also are transduced to affect cellular signaling , gene expression and cell function , which are crucial to developmental programming ( Lee et al . , 2006 ; Somogyi and Rorth , 2004 ; Farge , 2003 ) . Blocking such cell - generated forces appears to alter many basic cellular functions , such as proliferation , differentiation , sorting and migration ( Huang et al . , 1998 ; McBeath et al . , 2004 ; Sordella et al . , 2003 ; Krieg et al . , 2008 ; Lo et al . , 2004 ) . Recent efforts to modulate the stress that is generated by these cellular forces , by simply altering the mechanical stiffness of the substrate ( Box 1 ) against which cells pull , mirror the effects that are caused by directly altering cellular contractility ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ; Engler et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , even when not externally applied , cells experience endogenous mechanical forces that are generated by their internal cytoskeletal machinery , and these forces can be modulated by numerous factors . As such , mechanotransduction may have a more pervasive role in regulating cellular function than previously appreciated . Do different mechanical contexts – applied forces , cell - generated forces and stiffness sensing – exert changes in cell function through common mechanotransduction mechanisms ? What is known about how forces are generated and experienced by cells ? What are some of the mechanisms of mechanotransduction that are being examined ? Here , these issues will be discussed . This article is not an exhaustive compilation of the literature , which has been provided by several excellent reviews ( Ingber , 2003 ; Orr et al . , 2006 ) but , rather , a discussion of common emerging themes that connect different areas of inquiry ( applied forces , contractile forces and matrix mechanical properties ) in the hope of providing some context for the future of this field . Applied and cell - generated forces Cells and subcellular structures can experience stresses from many sources . External forces range from whole - body forces such as gravity and exercise - induced stresses on the musculoskeletal system , to tissue - specific forces such as the shear stress of blood flowing across endothelium , to the stretch of vessels owing to blood pressure , and to microscopic forces that occur when contracting cells pull on surrounding extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and on each other ( Fig . 1A ) . There are many different cellular responses to such forces , and many different mechanisms by which such forces are transduced to mediate such responses – too many to enumerate here Mechanical stresses are ever present in the cellular environment , whether through external forces that are applied to tissues or endogenous forces that are generated within the active cytoskeleton . Despite the wide array of studies demonstrating that such forces affect cellular signaling and function , it remains unclear whether mechanotransduction in different contexts shares common mechanisms . Here , I discuss possible mechanisms by which applied forces , cell - generated forces and changes in substrate mechanics could exert changes in cell function through common mechanotransduction machinery . I draw from examples that are primarily focused on the role of adhesions in transducing mechanical forces . Based on this discussion , emerging themes arise that connect these different areas of inquiry and suggest multiple avenues for future studies .

( Orr et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , just as in every transduction system , there is no one molecular or anatomical structure that drives all mechanotransduction responses . Perhaps the most well - described ( sub ) cellular sites for sensing mechanical forces are primary cilia , stretch - modulated ion channels and focal adhesions . Other putative sites for mechanosensing include the nuclear lamina and nucleus itself , the cytoskeleton and the cortical membrane ( Lammerding et al . , 2005 ; Han et al . , 2004 ; Tavernarakis and Driscoll , 2001 ; Sukharev and Corey , 2004 ; Resnick and Hopfer , 2007 ) . For the purposes of this discussion , I make two gross oversimplifications : first , I consider forces that are categorized simply as those that arise outside of the cell ( ‘applied forces’ ) and those that are generated inside the cell by the actin - myosin cytoskeleton ; and second , I focus on how these two types of forces might be related with respect to how they are transduced . Are external and cell - generated forces similar ? One can characterize forces by their magnitude , direction and dynamics ( Box 1 ) . The threshold magnitude of external forces that trigger cellular responses appears to be in the pN to nN range ( Choquet et al . , 1997 ; Jiang et al . , 2003 ; Goldschmidt et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , most measurements of cell - generated forces have reported magnitudes from 1 - 100 nN per focal adhesion ( Tan et al . , 2003 ; Dembo and Wang , 1999 ; Balaban et al . , 2001 ) . Endogenous , myosin - generated forces appear to be almost always contractile , such that the cell is under tension and forces that are applied to substrates are directed inward , towards the centroid of the cell ( Tan et al . , 2003 ; Dembo and Wang , 1999 ) . Although there are instances in which this directionality is not true , such as when cells extend filopodia or lamellipodia ( Prass et al . , 2006 ) , the generalization remains true for most measurements of cellular forces . By contrast , many types of external forces might not have such a radial direction . Moreover , most experimentally applied forces are step changes or those that follow a physiologic frequency ( for example , 1 Hz to model the cardiac cycle ) , whereas live recordings of cellular forces appear to suggest that most non - muscle cells exhibit complex force dynamics with a much wider frequency spectrum of activity ; intracellular signaling cycles may have their own circadian rhythms that lead to cycles of cytoskeletal activation and deactivation ( Galbraith and Sheetz , 1997 ; Giannone et al . , 2004 ) . These differences might lead one to conclude that cells transduce external and internal forces with entirely different mechanisms . However , recent studies increasingly suggest that these two forces are coupled . Perhaps the first indication of coupling between applied and cell - generated forces comes from numerous reports demonstrating that mechanotransduction of applied forces is often lost when myosin - based contractility is inhibited ( Zhao et al . , 2007 ; Sarasa - Renedo et al . , 2006 ; Torsoni et al . , 2005 ) . One explanation for this finding is that cell - generated forces and applied forces must act together on a mechanosensor to generate a response . Consider for a moment how force could be transduced . The application of force to an object can result in two basic responses – translation or stress . That is , if the object is not fixed in place by other forces , it will accelerate Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 20 ) Box 1 . Force , stress , contractility , tension , compliance , shear and all that : a simple description of mechanotransduction terminology and usage Force and stress Force is a vector ( with magnitude and direction ) that is classically deﬁned with accelerating a mass and , in studies of cells , is either applied to elicit a response or is measured to determine a mechanical reaction from cells . Stress , by contrast , speaks of a force per unit area ( see Figure ) . Whereas force and stress often increase together and , therefore , can be used interchangeably in limited settings , stress is more difﬁcult to calculate when a force is applied because the area across which a force is applied can change during an experiment and must be measured . Similarly , when stress is applied ( e . g . shear stress of ﬂuid ﬂowing over a cell ) , force is more difﬁcult to report . As such , it is best not to mix these two terms . Tension , compression , pressure and shear These terms refer to different types of forces and stresses . A cell in tension experiences a tensile force ( or stress ) from outside that pulls to elongate the cell . A cell can attempt to contract using myosin motors ( like a muscle ) but be unable to do so because it is attached to an inﬂexible substrate . In this case , the cell is in tension because , by convention , the external force from outside ( i . e . the substrate ) is counteracting the cell by acting to lengthen the cell . Thus , although seemingly paradoxical , this state is often described as contractile tension . Conversely , a compressive force ( or stress ) would act to decrease the length of the cell . By convention , unless otherwise speciﬁed , tensile and compressive forces generally refer to forces that are applied in one dimension . 2D forces are often referred to as ʻbiaxialʼ ( such as when inﬂating a balloon on which a cell is attached ) . Pressure is a 3D compressive stress ( not force ) but , unlike other forms of stress , is isotropic . Shear - forces or - stresses refer to those that act in - plane to the area experiencing the force ( as opposed to tension or compression which act perpendicular to that plane ) . Because shear forces are almost always applied to cells through a ﬂuid medium , and nearly all of the mathematics for ﬂuidic mechanics are expressed in stresses , studies involving shear generally refer to shear stress . Stiffness , compliance , elasticity and rigidity These terms refer to properties of a material . Stiffness describes either spring stiffness or material stiffness . Both reﬂect resistance to deformation . Spring stiffness is calculated by dividing applied force by the movement of the point where the force was applied . Note that this spring stiffness is speciﬁc to the dimensions and geometry of the experiment and , as such , cannot be translated and compared with other studies . Material stiffness ( sometimes referred to as the modulus or Youngʼs modulus ) is the geometry - independent equivalent and refers to an inherent property of the material itself . Compliance is the inverse of stiffness ( a material that is less stiff is more compliant ) . Elasticity is often used synonymously with compliance , although its strict usage refers to the degree to which a material is energy storing ( elastic , like a spring ) versus dissipating ( like a viscous ﬂuid ) . Rigidity is now used synonymously with stiffness , although it classically refers to a spring ( geometry - speciﬁc ) stiffness . Strength and hardness These quantities are unlikely to be commonly used in the context of mechanotransduction , as they generally refer to experiments that injure a material . Strength refers to the stress at which a material permanently deforms or fractures , and hardness or softness often refer to an experiment - speciﬁc degree to which a material scratches , deforms or fractures when indented by a sharp object . Thus , strength , hardness and stiffness should never be used synonymously . Stress Force Shear J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3287 Mechanotransduction ( causing the object to translate ) . If , however , net forces are zero , then the object will experience stress . The object can then respond ( mechanically ) to this stress by deforming reversibly ( elastically ) or irreversibly ( inelastically ) . In the context of cells , there are very few states of force disequilibrium that lead to whole - body acceleration ( a 1 pN disequilibrium , less than the magnitude required to break most single - receptor bonds , would accelerate a cell at ~ 1 m / second 2 ) . Thus , applied forces must necessarily be sensed by increased stress and resultant deformation of a sensor . The focal adhesion provides an excellent illustration of this : these adhesions are connected on the cytoplasmic face by the actin cytoskeleton and on the extracellular face by the ECM ( Fig . 1B , C ) . A cytoskeletally generated force leads to stress in the focal adhesion because an equal and opposite reactive force arises in the ECM ( which can be thought of as a passive spring ) . Studies demonstrate that when the ECM is not rigid – for example , when cells attach to small , submicrometer - diameter beads coated with ECM ligands – cytoskeletal tension and stress at adhesions do not develop and focal adhesions fail to mature ( Galbraith et al . , 2002 ) . Conversely , an externally applied force through the ECM results in stress at the focal adhesion only when the actin cytoskeleton provides an opposite , reactive force that balances the applied force ( Wang et al . , 1993 ; Choquet et al . , 1997 ) . In this case , the additional factor is that the actin cytoskeleton may give rise to this force through both passive deformation ( similar to a spring ) and through changes in myosin motor activity . Thus , one can explain how the inhibition of myosin - generated contractility could effectively prevent the development of stress in the focal adhesion , as any external force would simply stretch the cell ( and the adhesion site ) . Although there are some distinctions , similar arguments can be made based on the dependence of stretch - activated ion - channel activity on cytoskeletal integrity , applied forces and cell - generated forces ( Pellegrini et al . , 2001 ; Glogauer et al . , 1995 ) . A second possible interpretation for external - internal force coupling also exists . External forces trigger active changes in cytoskeletal structure and cellular force generation , which do more than merely balance the external force . For example , using optical traps , Choquet et al . demonstrated that , when cells pulled on adhesions and the substrate bound to that adhesion resisted this pull ( allowing stress to develop at the adhesion ) , adhesions would mature and be reinforced , and cells would subsequently pull with substantially higher forces on that same adhesion ( Choquet et al . , 1997 ) . Applying forces globally to cells – for example , by stretching underlying flexible substrates – leads to rapid and sustained activation of RhoA ( a Rho - family GTPase ) and myosin , and to the development of stress fibers ( Torsoni et al . , 2005 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ) . A recent study by Trepat and colleagues suggests that , in addition to such specific signaling mechanisms , certain types of change in cytoskeletal mechanics in response to applied forces – such as adaptive deformation to large applied forces through cytoskeletal depolymerization and repolymerization – are an inherent property of dense sol - gel networks ( in which monomers in solution and polymers forming gel coexist in rapid equilibrium ) and are shared by all cells that have cytoskeletons ( Trepat et al . , 2007 ) . That is , this property only requires having a phase transition that allows the cytoskeleton to shift through different physical forms , and not a specific biochemical mechanism . Interestingly , when applying minute forces to single adhesion sites and subsequently measuring cellular traction forces , one observes massive changes in cellular contractility that involve a relaxation followed by recovery of Sensor C Shear C y t o sk e l e t a l Tensile A B Cellmembrane Cell ECM ECM F ext F cell F cell F ext Fig . 1 .

( C ) This balance of forces provides the stress necessary for mechanical sensing .

Such observations naturally suggest that the transduction of external forces is not simply a force - signaling - response transduction sequence , and not even an external - internal force balance leading to a stress - signaling - response transduction sequence , but rather a dynamic feedback system involving external force , signaling , internal force , more signaling and then response . This distinction of including the activation of cell - generated forces in response to an external force is not merely semantic . Recall that external forces probably differ in direction , distribution across the cell and dynamics from those that are developed through the biochemical regulation of cytoskeletal tension . As such , the next section discusses these cell - generated forces and their contribution to mechanotransduction in greater depth . Cell - generated forces and their regulation The physical process of generating contractile force in non - muscle cells essentially involves the activation of non - muscle myosin - II motors , which act to crosslink , organize and affect sliding between actin microfilaments ( Landsverk and Epstein , 2005 ) . In the presence of strong adhesion against an underlying substrate , these filaments tend to coalesce into stress fibers that are tethered at sites of adhesion ( Chrzanowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ) . Although I will focus exclusively on myosin - regulated contractile forces , it is possible that other signals that alter actin polymerization and organization also alter force , and that other cytoskeletal elements such as microtubules also contribute to net forces ( Dogterom and Yurke , 1997 ; Stamenovic et al . , 2002 ; Reinhart - King et al . , 2005 ; Prass et al . , 2006 ; Heidemann et al . , 1990 ) . Whereas there are numerous mechanisms to modulate myosin activity , the best - described involves increased phosphorylation of non - muscle myosin II regulatory light chain ( MLC ) by myosin - light - chain kinase ( MLCK ) or the Rho effector p160ROCK , which additionally inactivates myosin phosphatase ( Amano et al . , 1996 ; Ishizaki et al . , 1996 ; Kimura et al . , 1996 ) . Not surprisingly , many different stimuli can modulate these signaling pathways and affect downstream traction forces . For example , many growth factors , cytokines and integrin ligands can activate these pathways . Interestingly , many of the downstream effects of growth - factor stimulation and integrin - mediated adhesion appear to require changes in cell contractility . For example , in the context of proliferative stimulation , pharmacologic inhibition of MLCK or disruption of the actin cytoskeleton arrests proliferation ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . Inhibiting RhoA activity with C3 exoenzyme or dominant - negative mutants of RhoA blocks cell proliferation , whereas microinjection of constitutively active RhoA promotes DNA synthesis ( Pirone et al . , 2006 ; Olson et al . , 1995 ; Yamamoto et al . , 1993 ; Welsh et al . , 2001 ; Sahai et al . , 2001 ) . Inhibition of ROCK with Y - 27632 , or dominant - negative ROCK suppresses mitogen - induced DNA synthesis of cells in vitro and in vivo ( Pirone et al . , 2006 ; Sawada et al . , 2000 ; Uchida et al . , 2000 ; Uehata et al . , 1997 ) . Similar findings that suggest a role for cell - generated forces in modulating cell differentiation , migration and gene expression have also been reported ( McBeath et al . , 2004 ; Hoang et al . , 2004 ; Liu and Senger , 2004 ) . In general , these studies clearly suggest a ubiquitous role for cell - generated forces in regulating cell signaling and function , and prompt additional questions . What initiates this force generation ? Do many different stimuli modulate cellular forces ? Do they modulate the magnitude and spatiotemporal dynamics in common or unique ways ? Are these effects all mediated through a common set of pathways , such as the RhoA and MLCK pathways , or do different signaling pathways modulate contractility through as yet uncharacterized means ? Surprisingly little has been reported that sheds light on these questions , probably because there is limited access to approaches that measure cellular forces , and tools have not yet been developed to address questions that require a systematic comparison of different stimuli , signals and cell types with respect to their effects on force generation . Once generated by different stimuli , how are these cellular forces transduced into biochemical effects ? At focal adhesions , numerous proteins are phosphorylated and recruited to sites of adhesion in a stress - dependent manner , and inhibition of contractility results in rapid disassembly of such structures , suggesting that adhesions are one possible site for mechanotransduction ( Chrzanowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ; Galbraith et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 1993 ) . Such studies have pointed to focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , Src and other associated molecules within focal adhesions in transducing force to responses such as proliferation and differentiation ( von Wichert et al . , 2008 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ) . However , because direct manipulations of such pathways can feed back to modulate force generation itself ( Pirone et al . , 2006 ; Palazzo et al . , 2004 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ; Arthur et al . , 2000 ) , it has been difficult to separate their roles in force generation versus force transduction . One alternative approach to identifying putative sensors is to provide better spatial and temporal descriptions of endogenous signaling following stimulation with force . Observing the activation of Src spatiotemporally with a FRET probe has demonstrated activation at adhesion sites following stress application , and rapid diffusion of active Src into the cell ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) . Nonetheless , the challenge of numerous feedback loops between adhesion , signaling and cellular contractility remains a barrier to identifying the contribution of each player to the overall mechanotransduction response . Thus , one is still faced with the question : what is the actual event that converts mechanical stress to a biochemical event ? One of the most plausible proposed mechanisms involves protein unfolding . Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 20 ) A ECM B Sensor ECM Cellmembrane F cell F cell Fig . 2 . Effects of stress on a cell . ( A ) Focal adhesion that experiences stress from a cell - generated contractile force ( F cell ) pulling against an ECM ( blue ) . ( B ) Stress generated in the focal adhesion ( sensor ) depends on both the cell - generated force ( F cell ) and the stiffness of the ECM . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 32893289 Mechanotransduction In this model , stresses in the cytoskeleton , focal adhesions and / or ECM cause conformational changes in specific proteins . Fibronectin has been shown to reveal normally cryptic regions when experiencing stresses that are comparable to those generated by cells against ECM ( Erickson , 1994 ; Abu - Lail et al . , 2006 ; Smith et al . , 2007 ) . Some controversy remains as to the exact nature of the unfolding process – whether it primarily involves inter - or intra - domain rearrangements – but the demonstration of new binding sites on fibronectin is incontrovertible . Similarly , it has now been shown that p130cas , an important scaffolding protein within focal adhesions , alters its structure under stress to render it more susceptible to Src - mediated phosphorylation , thereby promoting force - mediated adhesion assembly ( Sawada et al . , 2006 ) . The application of a classic biochemical method – shotgun labeling of cysteine residues – to cells under tension has revealed numerous other proteins ( including vimentin , filamin , myosin and spectrin ) that either unmask cryptic sequences or alter their assembly under stress ( Johnson et al . , 2007 ) . Such studies provide an important experimental validation of much theoretical and computational power that can be and has been applied to the prediction of force - mediated effects on proteins ( Pabon and Amzel , 2006 ; Hytonen and Vogel , 2008 ) . These exciting developments now set a challenge for the near future in defining more explicitly how such structural changes exert their individual effects and how signaling is modulated as a whole . Stiffness sensing A case has been made for the necessary development of mechanical stress within the cytoskeleton for mechanotransduction . One way of alleviating or preventing such stress is if cells are either detached from a physical substrate ; another is if the substrate itself provides no resistance to deformation when cells pull on them . The extent to which a substrate resists deformation is described by its stiffness . Different tissues and organs span a wide range of mechanical properties , one of which is material stiffness ( Discher et al . , 2005 ) . Moreover , such properties change during tissue development as well as during pathological processes such as fibrosis or tumorigenesis ( Georges et al . , 2007 ; Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ; Davidson et al . , 1999 ) . As these changes in mechanical properties are tightly coupled in vivo to numerous changes in ECM composition , crosslinking and density , it has until recently been impossible to decouple the relative impact of mechanical from biochemical changes in matrix , with regard to cellular responses . However , developments in the use of matrix - functionalized synthetic substrates – most notably polyacrylamide gels – have enabled studies that suggested that substrate stiffness itself can alter numerous cellular functions including migration , proliferation and differentiation ( Li et al . , 2007 ; Peyton and Putnam , 2005 ; Leach et al . , 2007 ; Lo et al . , 2000 ) . Some cell types appear to migrate preferentially towards stiffer regions of a matrix , a phenomenon now termed ‘durotaxis’ ( Lo et al . , 2000 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ; Gray et al . , 2003 ; Wong et al . , 2003 ) . Increasing stiffness also appears to enhance proliferation in numerous normal as well as transformed cell types , and facilitates tumor progression ( Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ; Georges and Janmey , 2005 ) . Interestingly , mesenchymal stem cells will differentiate into different lineage fates as a function of material stiffness , and appear to do so in a way that would promote tissue - specific healing ( Engler et al . , 2006 ) . For example , on brain - tissue - like stiffness cells undergo neuronal differentiation , whereas muscle - equivalent stiffness promotes myogenesis . The mechanism by which cells sense stiffness remains poorly defined , but early evidence suggests that the sensing system involves modulation of the same players as in other mechanotransduction pathways – integrins , focal adhesions and myosin - based contractility . The simplest explanation would be that a compliant substrate directly reduces the stress at cell - matrix adhesions in an actively contracting cell ( Fig . 2 ) . In turn , this decreased stress suppresses the normal maturation of focal adhesions and provides evidence that compliant substrates probably suppress certain types of signals while promoting others . Supporting this notion is the finding that focal adhesions are smaller or absent in cells that are cultured on compliant substrates , and that FAK phosphorylation is decreased ( Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ) . Such an effect could occur through increased activation of these signaling pathways with increased stress or , indirectly , through increased phosphatase activity for settings of decreased stress . Indeed , the receptor - like protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTP α has been shown to be crucial for force sensing at adhesions ( von Wichert et al . , 2003 ) . However , RhoA activity also appears to be suppressed in compliant settings , which suggests that stiffness feeds back to alter directly the degree of myosin activation and cellular contractility itself ( Engler et al . , 2006 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ) . Because RhoA and integrin signaling appear to have numerous coupled feedforward and feedback loops ( the very topologies of which could be altered by mechanics ) , at this point we cannot conclude at what level ( s ) substrate stiffness impinges on this mechanochemical sensing system . Indeed , mutant integrins that constitutively cluster and the modulation of RhoA can induce cells on compliant substrates to revert to a phenotype that is characteristic of stiff substrates ( Paszek and Weaver , 2004 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ) . As such , many questions remain . Perhaps most fundamental is whether the transduction of stiffness to a response actually involves sensing stress . The existing data are certainly consistent with the possibility that focal adhesions ( or other sensors ) alter their structure and function simply and primarily as a result of changes in stress when cells are attached to substrates of different stiffnesses . For example , Engler et al . used pure collagen - I gels as well as polyacrylamide gels ( two polymers that form gels through very different mechanisms ) to show that cellular responses were equivalent on gels of equivalent stiffness ( Engler et al . , 2004 ) . Although these data support a strong case for a mechanical basis for sensing , they do not exclude several other plausible mechanisms . As all of these studies use polymers with varying degrees of crosslinking to alter stiffness , it is impossible to decouple the nanomolecular changes in polymer - chain mobility , flexibility and hydration . In fact , for such gels , bulk stiffness changes as a direct result of these molecular changes . Although decoupling these molecular from bulk effects may be more a matter of semantics and practical insight , such changes could also alter the accessibility , shielding and effective ability of cellular receptors to engage and cluster matrix ligands that are immobilized to these polymers . Using other model systems , it has been demonstrated that such polymer shielding can alter cell adhesion and effective integrin - binding affinity ( Houseman and Mrksich , 2001 ; Keselowsky et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , changes in substrate stiffness might simply be a coincident marker of the ability of the substrate to affect integrin ligation , in which case the observed changes in RhoA signaling and mechanical tension might be downstream effects of a primary modulation of integrin signaling . It has been reported that changes in stiffness cause a change in cell shape , in which cells retain a more rounded morphology on compliant substrates and take on a more flattened shape on stiff J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3290 Journal of Cell Science 121 ( ) 3290 substrates ( classically associated with cells that are cultured on hard plastic ) . How stiffness changes cell shape is not known and could involve the mechanical or integrin - mediated mechanisms just described . But because changes in cell shape are also associated with changes in RhoA - mediated contractility and focal adhesion formation , shape changes could themselves be embedded within the control loop that involves RhoA , contractility , focal adhesions and changes in cell function . However , one early study suggests that even when cell shape is constrained , focal adhesion dynamics are still different on compliant versus stiff substrates , suggesting that stiffness - induced changes in cell shape are not likely to explain stiffness sensing ( Guo and Wang , 2007 ) . Thus , although at its core stiffness sensing probably involves transducing a stress into biological signals , multiple mechanisms might be at play . Concluding remarks Although the themes raised in this discussion of mechanotransduction necessarily draw more heavily from one example ( focal adhesions ) , the overall conclusions can be applied more broadly . One is reminded that numerous additional sites have been implicated in transducing mechanical stresses , including cell - cell junctions ( Liu et al . , 2007 ; Tzima et al . , 2005 ) , stretch - activated ion channels ( Pellegrini et al . , 2001 ; Sukharev and Corey , 2004 ; Tavernarakis and Driscoll , 2001 ) , primary cilia ( Resnick and Hopfer , 2007 ) , the cytoskeleton itself ( Han et al . , 2004 ) and the nucleus ( Maniotis et al . , 1997 ; Lammerding et al . , 2005 ) . As in focal adhesions , mechanotransduction at these sites probably also depends on the development of stresses that are generated by a balance of external forces and cell - generated forces , and involves molecular conformational changes that result in signaling . Importantly , evidence clearly points to multiple pathways for crosstalk between different transduction sites , such as between cell - cell junctions and focal adhesions : in endothelium , platelet endothelial - cell adhesion molecule 1 ( PECAM1 ) appears to be crucial for transducing shear stresses in a manner that involves modulating integrin binding ( Tzima et al . , 2005 ) . Cadherin engagement can modulate RhoA signaling and contractility , as well as mechanically alter how stresses are distributed across cells ( Nelson et al . , 2004 ; Nelson et al . , 2005 ) . As such , mechanotransduction for cells in isolation might be quite different from how forces are transduced in different multicellular contexts . One crucial focus of future studies will involve the further characterization of such cooperative mechanisms , as well as clearly defining the similarities and differences between different mechanosensory systems . One question that remains to be answered is how specificity may arise in mechanotransduction responses . That is , it has been clearly demonstrated that different magnitudes and types of forces ( e . g . laminar versus turbulent shear flow , uniaxial versus biaxial stretch , stretch versus shear ) lead to different responses , but how such differences are produced remains unexplored . Certainly , one can reason that the spatiotemporal signatures in mechanical stimuli could result in spatiotemporal signatures in cellular signaling from a common set of distributed sensors ( e . g . focal adhesions ) . One can also imagine that different sensors ( e . g . protein unfolding events ) occur at different thresholds , or that different sites ( e . g . cell - cell junctions versus nucleus ) are primed to sense certain forces better than others . Going forward , the field will transition from identifying the contexts in which forces are important to elucidating how such forces exact specific effects . Another challenge is to link mechanotransduction studies across different length scales in order to provide a more global view of its mechanisms . From identifying stress - induced molecular deformations and their functional effects , to mapping system - wide changes in cell signaling networks , to understanding forces in complex , multicellular processes in whole organisms , we are still unable to cross the boundaries between these length scales . A great deal of this challenge arises from two crucial features of mechanotransduction : that cell and tissue structure both modulate and are sculpted by mechanical stresses , and that there are numerous feedback loops between cell signaling and force generation . Thus , we are faced with mapping the spatial distribution of forces at the subcellular level through to stress gradients at the tissue level , linking these distributions to structural and functional effects , and tracking the evolution of these mechanical - functional effects through time . Theoretical constructs are in the early stages to develop computational models of various aspects of this problem , from focal adhesion assembly ( Shemesh et al . , 2005 ; Nicolas et al . , 2008 ) , to cytoskeletal contractility ( Pathak et al . , 2008 ; Deshpande et al . , 2006 ) to physical models of morphogenesis ( Odell et al . , 1980 ; Keller et al . , 2003 ) . The experimental barriers are even more daunting . Undoubtedly , the challenge will call upon many disciplines to make both theoretical and experimental innovations , in order to provide a path towards understanding how biological systems operate in a physical world .
