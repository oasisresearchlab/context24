Flow cytometry , fluorescence microscopy and Alamar Blue - based metabolic assays were used to assess activities of mycolactones on the murine L929 fibroblast cell line . Modifications of the C - linked upper side chain ( comprising C12 – C20 ) caused less pronounced changes in cytotoxicity than modifications in the lower C5 - O - linked polyunsaturated acyl side chain . A derivative with a truncated lower side chain was unique in having strong inhibitory effects on fibroblast metabolism and cell proliferation at non - cytotoxic concentrations . We also tested whether mycolactones have antimicrobial activity and found no activity against representatives of Gram - positive ( Streptococcus pneumoniae ) or Gram - negative bacteria ( Neisseria meningitis and Escherichia coli ) , the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisae or the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum . Conclusion : Highly defined synthetic compounds allowed to unambiguously compare biological activities of mycolactones expressed by different M . ulcerans lineages and may help identifying target structures and triggering pathways .

Mycolactones have been shown to act both in vivo and in vitro on various mammalian cell types , including fibroblasts [ 1 – 6 ] , adipocytes [ 7 ] , keratinocytes [ 8 ] , myocytes [ 9 , 10 ] , macrophages [ 2 , 6 , 11 – 14 ] , dendritic cells [ 15 ] and T - cells [ 16 – 18 ] . Effects caused by mycolactones include induction of apoptosis / necrosis , cytoskeletal rearrangements , impaired cytokine production and interference with cellular signaling . The polyketide synthases required for mycolactone biosynthesis are encoded on the extrachromosomal plasmid pMUM [ 19 , 20 ] . M . ulcerans has evolved from a common M . marinum ancestor by acquisition of this plasmid and has subsequently diverged into two principal mycolactone - producing lineages [ 21 , 22 ] . The ‘‘classical’’ lineage includes M . ulcerans isolates associated with Buruli ulcer from Africa and Australia . The ‘‘ancestral’’ lineage includes both Buruli ulcer isolates from Japan , China and Mexico and isolates from fish and frogs previously also designated M . pseudoshottsii , M . liflandii or M . marinum [ 23 , 24 ] . Mycolactones are composed of a 12 - membered macrolide core and two attached side chains ; a short upper , C - linked side chain ( comprising C12 – C20 ) and a longer lower , C5 - O - linked polyunsaturated acyl side chain . While the macrolide core structure and upper side chain are conserved , mycolactone populations from different M . ulcerans sub - lineages vary in the length , the number and localization of hydroxyl groups and in the number of double bonds of the lower side chain . M . ulcerans strains may produce several molecular variants of mycolactone , with one or more species dominating [ 25 ] . The mycolactone repertoire seems to be highly conserved within a defined geographical sub - lineage of M . ulcerans [ 25 ] . Mycolactone A / B is produced by strains of the classical M . ulcerans lineage found in Africa and is regarded as the most potent toxin . Australian classical lineage strains produce - in addition to mycolactone A / B - mycolactone C , which lacks one hydroxyl group . Mycolactone D with an additional methyl group is produced by Chinese strains belonging to the ancestral lineage . M . ulcerans ancestral lineage isolates from fish and frogs have been found to produce the mycolactone variants E and F . Mycolactones have previously been prepared from M . ulcerans cultures by a two - step extraction procedure , yielding preparations PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www . plosntds . org 1 March 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e2143 of acetone soluble lipids predominantly containing mycolactone . These extracts can be further purified by chromatographic methods [ 26 ] ; nevertheless , the use of extracted mycolactones for comparative studies may be compromised by the heterogeneity of preparations . Therefore , biological studies with highly defined synthetic mycolactones represent an attractive alternative . Based on the established synthesis of the mycolactone core [ 27 – 30 ] , different synthesis strategies have been pursued for the stereose - lective partial and total synthesis of mycolactones [ 31 – 33 ] . In addition , simplified C8 - desmethyl - mycolactone analogues have been synthesized , which were analyzed for their cytopathic potency by using cell rounding as a parameter to compare cytotoxic activities [ 34 ] . No systematic structure - activity relation - ship studies on larger sets of synthetic mycolactones have been published so far . Results of individual studies cannot be reliably compared , since different readouts , such as cell rounding [ 22 , 34 , 35 ] , cytokine production [ 36 ] or flow cytometric param - eters [ 35 , 36 ] have been employed . Furthermore , different cell lines ( such as Jurkat T - cells [ 36 ] , murine fibroblasts [ 22 , 34 , 35 ] and sets of human tumor cell lines [ 37 ] have been used and cytotoxic activity has been assessed after different times , such as 24 hours [ 36 ] or 24 and 48 hours [ 35 ] . Most of these structure - activity studies have been limited to mycolactone A / B and a limited number of derivatives . A comparison of the activity of eight C8 - desmethyl mycolactone analogues is hampered by the fact that lack of the C8 - methyl substituent reduces the cytopathic activity by a factor of 125 [ 34 ] . Here , we have performed more systematic comparative studies using synthetically produced natural toxins and additional structural mycolactone variants that are not found in nature . Materials and Methods Synthetic mycolactones We recently reported the synthesis of mycolactone A / B [ 38 ] . Details of the syntheses of mycolactones C and F and of the six non - natural mycolactone derivatives will be published elsewhere ( Gersbach et al . , manuscript in preparation ) . Briefly , all mycolac - tones discussed here were prepared by the same overall strategy that we had previously developed for the synthesis of mycolactone A / B . Thus , a modified Suzuki coupling was employed to establish the C12 – C13 bond and elaborate the full upper side chain and a Yamaguchi type acylation reaction was used to attach the lower side chain . All final products used for biological testing were purified by RP - HPLC ; they were generally obtained as mixtures of ( interconverting ) double bond isomers . Analytical data for the synthetic compounds are provided as supplementary information ( S1 ) . For biological testing , 0 . 5 mg / ml stock solutions of the mycolactones were prepared in cell culture grade DMSO ( Sigma ) . Stock solutions were aliquoted and stored frozen at 2 20 u C . Cytotoxicity assay Murine L929 fibroblasts were grown in RPMI medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( Sigma ) , 2 mM glutamine ( Gibco ) and 0 . 05 mM b - mercaptoethanol ( Gibco ) and incubated at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were passaged 3 – 6 times prior to use in cytotoxicity experiments . For flow cytometry analysis 24 , 000 cells were seeded into 24 - well plates ( Falcon ) and allowed to adhere o / n . Medium was then aspirated and replaced by 500 m l medium containing different concentrations of mycolactone and 0 . 12 % DMSO ( vol / vol ) . After incubation for 24 , 48 or 72 h , cells were detached from the culture plates by repeated gentle flushing through a pipette tip without use of Trypsin - EDTA . Harvested cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 1 , 200 x g , resuspended in 300 m l binding buffer with 0 . 2 m g / ml Annexin V - FITC ( Annex - inV kit , Calbiochem ) and incubated for 30 min at 4 u C . The cells were spun again and pellets were resuspended in 300 m l staining buffer containing 0 . 3 m g / ml propidium iodide ( AnnexinV kit , Calbiochem ) . Cell suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) and apoptotic ( A + / PI 2 ) and necrotic ( A + / PI + ) cell populations were determined using the CellQuest Pro Software ( Becton Dickinson ) . The experiments were set up in triplicates and performed at least twice . Mycolactone A / B in a concentration range of 3 . 75 to 120 ng / ml was included as control in all experiments . The mycolactone concentration at which 50 % of the cells were killed ( LC 50 ) was determined by plotting the percentage of affected cells ( sum of A + / PI 2 and A + / PI + cells ) against the log concentration of the individual mycolactones . In Fig . 1 – 3 only data for concentrations close to the LC 50 are shown . Inhibition of cell proliferation To measure proliferation of L929 fibroblasts , 24 , 000 cells were seeded into 24 - well plates ( Falcon ) and allowed to adhere o / n . The medium was aspirated and replaced by 500 m l medium containing 60 ng / ml of mycolactone and 0 . 06 % DMSO ( vol / vol ) . At time point 0 and after 24 , 48 and 72 h fibroblasts were harvested , diluted 1 : 100 in isotonous solution and measured using an automated cell counting device ( Casy H TT , Scha¨rfe System ) . The experiment was set up in triplicates and performed twice . Microscopic analysis 24 , 000 cells were seeded on four - chamber glass slides ( BD Falcon ) with complete RPMI medium and allowed to adhere for 24 hours . The medium was aspirated and replaced by 500 m l medium containing different concentrations of mycolactone . After the specified incubation period , cells were washed once in PBS and fixed with 4 % formaldehyde ( Medite ) for 20 min . Fibroblasts were washed again in PBS prior to permeabilization in Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 1 % in PBS ) for 20 min . Cells were rinsed in PBS and blocked by incubation in 4 % FBS in PBS for additional 20 min . The actin cytoskeleton was stained by incubating the cells for 1 h at room temperature with Texas Red - X phalloidin ( 3 units / ml , in blocking solution , Molecular Probes ) . Cells were washed in blocking buffer , then in PBS . ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Invitrogen ) Author Summary Buruli ulcer is a chronic necrotizing skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans . The characteristic histopatholog - ical features of Buruli ulcer , severe destruction of subcu - taneous tissue with minimal inflammation in the core of the lesion , are primarily attributed to the cytotoxic activity of mycolactone , the macrolide exotoxin of M . ulcerans . Different geographical lineages of M . ulcerans produce different structural variants of mycolactone . By using highly defined synthetic mycolactones , including both naturally occurring molecular species and additional non - natural variants , we have assessed the influence of the structure of the C - linked upper side chain and the lower C5 - O - linked polyunsaturated acyl side chain on biological activity . Changes in the lower side chain affected the cytotoxic activity against mammalian cells more profound - ly than changes in the upper side chain . Mycolactone A / B had no antimicrobial activity against Gram - positive and Gram - negative bacteria and was also inactive against Saccharomyces and Dictyostelium . Biological Activities of Synthetic Mycolactones PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www . plosntds . org 2 March 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e2143 containing diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) was used for nuclear counterstaining . Cover slips were mounted onto the slides and cell rounding as well as the staining of nuclei and actin cytoskeleton was qualitatively analyzed by fluorescence microscopy ( Leica DM 5000 B ) . Mycolactone - induced changes in the pattern and intensity of the Texas Red - X phalloidin staining of the cytosolic actin cytoskeleton as well as in the uniform , round and clear - edged DAPI staining of nuclei in healthy cells were observed .

After mycolactone treatment , alamarBlue H reagent ( Invitrogen ) was added to the wells ( 10 % v / v ) and the cells were further incubated for 1 hour at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 . Fluorescence intensities were measured using a SpectraMax Gemini XS ( Molecular Devices ) and the values were calculated referring to the DMSO control ( 0 ng / ml mycolactone ) set at 100 % . The experiments were set up in triplicates and performed at least twice . The concentration at which the metabolic activity of cells was inhibited by half ( IC 50 ) was determined by plotting the fluorescence intensity against the log concentration of the individual mycolactones . Assessment of the antimicrobial activity of mycolactone A / B Antimicrobial activity of mycolactone on Streptococcus pneumoniae ( SP1 , P1577 ) , E . coli ( DE ( 3 ) ) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was tested by applying the disk agar diffusion ( Kirby - Bauer ) method . Bacteria were pelleted , resuspended in PBS and spread on blood agar / LB agar . The plates were dried for 30 min and sterile paper disks were distributed circle - like onto the agar . Mycolactone A / B solutions of different concentrations ( 0 . 003 m g / ml to 10 m g / ml ) were applied on the paper disks ( 40 m l ) . The agar plates were incubated o / n at 37 u C and then analyzed for potential zones of inhibition . The effect of mycolactone A / B on the growth of Dictyostelium discoideum DH1 - 10 was assessed by performing an Alamar Blue assay in a 24 - well format . 2 , 000 cells were seeded in 500 m l medium containing mycolactone in the concentration range of 0 . 16 to 500 ng / ml . As controls , DMSO and blasticidin were used . After an incubation period of 3 days at room temperature , alamarBlue H reagent ( Invitrogen ) was added and the plate was further incubated for 18 hours at room temperature . Results Recently we described a novel strategy for the synthesis of mycolactone A / B that is based on the stereoselective construction of the macrolactone core by ring - closing olefin metathesis and subsequent incorporation of the C - and O - linked side chains by suitable fragment couplings [ 38 ] . Taking this synthesis approach a set of natural mycolactones ( mycolactone A / B , mycolactone C , mycolactone F ) and additional derivatives displaying modifications Figure 2 . Cytotoxicity of mycolactone variants with modifications in the upper side chain . Cells were treated for 48 hours with different concentrations of PG - 157 , PG - 165 or PG - 182 and stained with annexin - V - FITC and PI . Flow cytometry was used to determine the annexin - positive ( A + ) and PI - positive ( PI + ) cell populations . Triplicate samples were analyzed and mean values as well as standard deviations are shown . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0002143 . g002 Biological Activities of Synthetic Mycolactones PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www . plosntds . org 4 March 2013 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e2143 in the lower or upper side chain ( PG - 119 , PG - 120 , PG - 155 , PG - 157 , PG - 165 and PG - 182 ) were produced ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 3 ) for biological testing . The biological activity of these synthetic compounds on the murine L929 fibroblast cell line was assessed by flow cytometry . After treatment with different concentrations of synthetic mycolactones , cells were stained both with FITC - labeled annexin - V and with propidium iodide . Annexin - V binds to exposed phosphatidylserine residues translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in cells undergoing apoptosis . Propidium iodide intercalates into the DNA of cells that have lost nuclear membrane integrity , serving as a marker for necrosis . Quadrant analysis was performed to determine apoptotic ( A + / PI 2 ) and necrotic ( A + / PI + ) cell populations . While first signs of mycolactone A / B - mediated cell death were already detectable after 24 hours , significant effects were only observed after 48 hours [ 38 ] . For comparison with mycolactone A / B , the lethal concentration of mycolactone analogues at which 50 % of the cells were affected ( LC 50 ) was therefore determined after 48 hours ( Table 1 ) . As described previously [ 38 ] , mycolactone A / B was highly potent ( Figure 1 ) with a LC 50 of 12 nM ( Table 1 ) . For the two naturally occurring structural variants mycolactone F and mycolactone C , the LC 50 values were 29 nM and 186 nM , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Mycolactone C differs from mycolactone A / B in lacking the hydroxyl group at position C12 of the lower side chain . Mycolactone F has a shorter side chain with also only two hydroxyl substituents ( Figure 1 ) . While these natural mycolactones retained cytotoxic activity , compound PG - 155 , a non - natural structural variant devoid of all hydroxyl groups in the lower side chain , showed only minor activity with a LC 50 of 4550 nM ( Table 1 ) . Apart from these mycolactone variants with modifications in the lower side chain , also analogues with modifications in the upper side chain were synthesized and tested ( Figure 2 ) . Introduction of a hydroxyl group at C20 in compound PG - 165 had no major effect , since PG - 165 had only a slightly higher LC 50 ( 15 nM ) than mycolactone A / B ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ) . In addition , derivatisation of this hydroxyl group into an acetate ( PG - 157 with a LC 50 of 45 nM ) or into a bulky butyl carbamate ( PG - 182 with a LC 50 of 50 nM ) reduced cytotoxicity only about three - fold ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ) . Thus , the upper side chain turned out to be relatively tolerant to a significant extension in length and to the presence of polar linker elements between the natural side chain and the extension module . PG - 120 , a derivative with a significantly truncated lower side chain , showed some residual cytotoxic activity ( LC 50 = 3426 nM ) , whereas PG - 119 , a derivative with an acetyl residue as the lower side chain , showed no activity within the concentration range tested ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) . For all compounds , except PG - 120 , concentrations required for cytotoxic activity ( as measured by flow cytometry ) , reduction of metabolic activity in an Alamar Blue - based assay , changes in the intensity and pattern of phalloidin - staining of the actin cytoskeleton and changes in the round , clear - edged and uniformly stained nuclear morphology of normal cells were in the same range . While the IC 50 value for PG - 120 ( 171 nM ; Table 1 ) , was twenty - fold lower than the LC 50 , the LC 50 / IC 50 ratios of all other compounds with widely varying toxic Figure 3 .

Furthermore , at such sub - lethal PG - 120 concentrations a marked reduction in cell proliferation ( Figure 4 ) , and a transient effect on the actin cytoskeleton accompanied by the rounding up of the cells , without changes in nuclear morphology was observed ( Figure 5A ) . A similar activity was not observed for PG - 119 ( Figures 4 and 5 ) . When analyzed for antimicrobial activity , mycolactone A / B was found inactive against all microbial species tested , including Gram - positive ( Streptococcus pneumoniae ) and Gram - negative ( Neisseria meningitis , Escherichia coli ) bacteria ; it was also inactive against yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisae ) and amoeba ( Dictyostelium discoideum ) .

Activity of the synthetic mycolactone A / B was in the range reported for mycolactone preparations extracted from M . ulcerans cultures [ 1 ] . Mycolactone F was about two times less active and mycolactone C about 15 times less active than mycolactone A / B , respectively . For extracted mycolactone C an even far more pronounced difference in activity compared to mycolactone A / B has been described in assays determining L929 fibroblast rounding at 24 h and loss of monolayer at 48 h [ 25 ] . In addition to mycolactone C , Australian M . ulcerans strains also produce mycolactone A / B . Our data indicate that this mycolac - tone A / B portion may be more important for the pathogenesis caused by these strains than mycolactone C . In accordance with our findings , only a slightly lower activity was observed , when extracted mycolactone F was compared to mycolactone A / B in a L929 cell apoptosis assay at 24 h [ 3 ] . When the inhibition of IL2 production by activated Jurkat T - cells instead of cell death was used as readout , both mycolactones F and C were dramatically less potent than mycolactone A / B [ 36 ] . While we have investigated different types of modifications for the lower and upper side chains , it is clear that both the incorporation of polar substituents at C20 and the extension of the upper side chain by up to 7 heavy atoms , in contrast to most of the modifications of the lower side chain , does not lead to a substantial loss in cytotoxicity . It remains to be seen how the removal of hydroxyl groups from the upper side chain or its overall shortening would affect potency . It has been proposed that mycolactones enter mammalian cells via passive diffusion and interact with cytosolic target ( s ) [ 39 ] . Reduced or abolished activity of structural variants of mycolactone may thus be related to lack of binding to target structure ( s ) , inefficient triggering of activation pathways or reduced transloca - tion across the cell membrane . Studies using isotopically labeled rather than fluorescence labeled structures with altered biophysical properties are required to gain better insight into mechanisms that allow mycolactones to cross biological membranes . Our findings with the truncated mycolactone PG - 120 shows that different biological effects of mycolactone can be dissociated by using structural variants . In line with these observations , sub - lethal doses of mycolactone A / B have been shown to alter trafficking and cytokine production of lymphocytes and macro - phages [ 40 , 41 ] . It remains to be elucidated whether different pathways and target structures are involved in the triggering of the biological effects of mycolactone . Since a number of macrolides have antibiotic activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria it has been speculated that mycolactone secreted by M . ulcerans during active disease may prevent superin - fection of BU wounds . However , synthetic mycolactone A / B showed no antimicrobial activity against any of the microorganisms tested here . In line with this observation , superinfection of Buruli ulcer lesions seems to be much more common than traditionally anticipated ( Yeboah - Manu et al . , personal communication ) . Much has still to be learnt about the biophysical properties of mycolactones , their distribution and stability in biological systems , their target structures and triggering pathways in mammalian cells . Synthetic natural mycolactones , isotopically labeled derivatives and structural variants represent valuable tools to address these open questions in future .
