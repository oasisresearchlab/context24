Scotney 1 , Sarah Weissmeyer 1 , Nicole Carbert 2 and Liane Gabora 1 * 1 Department of Psychology , University of British Columbia , Kelowna , BC , Canada , 2 School of Population and Public Health , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , BC , Canada To what extent are creative processes in one domain ( e . g . , technology ) affected by information from other domains ( e . g . , music ) ? While some studies of professional creators suggest that creative abilities are domain - speciﬁc , other studies suggest that creative avocations stimulate creativity . The latter is consistent with the predictions of the honing theory of creativity , according to which the iterative process culminating in a creative work is made possible by the self - organizing nature of a conceptual network , or worldview , and its innate holistic tendency to minimize inconsistency . As such , the creative process is not restricted to the creative domain ; inﬂuences from domains other than that of the ﬁnal product are predicted to impact the creative process and its outcome . To assess the prevalence of cross - domain inﬂuences on creativity we conducted two studies : one with creative experts , and one with undergraduate students from diverse academic backgrounds . Participants listed both their creative outputs , and the inﬂuences ( sources of inspiration ) associated with each of these outputs . In both studies , cross - domain inﬂuences on creativity were found to be widespread , and indeed more frequent than within - domain sources of inspiration . Thus , examination of the inputs to , rather than the outputs of , creative tasks supported the prediction of honing theory that cross - domain inﬂuences are a ubiquitous component of the creative process . Keywords : creativity , cross - domain , domain - general , domain - speciﬁc , inﬂuence , inspiration INTRODUCTION Creative thought is central to human life . It shapes everyday activities such as putting together an outﬁt or holding a conversation . It fuels cultural evolution , giving us technology , music , media , and art . It fosters a sense of personal and cultural identity . Yet although it is perhaps our most deﬁning human trait , it is one of the most elusive aspects of human cognition . Creativity is thought to involve the restructuring of information in a creative domain , sometimes referred to as the problem domain ( Runco , 2014 ) , or simply , the domain . Domain - speciﬁc theories of creativity emphasize the non - transferability of expertise from one creative domain to another ( Baer , 2015 ) . These theories appear to be supported by ﬁndings that creative individuals are rarely creative in more than a few domains ( i . e . , someone known for their creativity in physics is rarely also known for their creativity as a dancer ; Kaufman and Baer , 2004a ; Baer , 2012 ) , Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 1 June 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1426 fpsyg - 10 - 01426 June 17 , 2019 Time : 17 : 32 # 2 Scotney et al . Cross - Domain Thinking and by low correlations between an individuals’ creative products in diﬀerent domains ( Baer , 1991 ) . Domain - speciﬁc theories are consistent with evidence that revolutionary creativity – sometimes referred to as ‘Big C’ creativity ( Kaufman and Beghetto , 2009 ) – requires speciﬁc knowledge and skills in a domain , which requires extensive practise and learning , a phenomenon referred to as the ‘10 - year rule’ on the basis of evidence that 10 years’ experience in a domain is necessary for creative success ( Ericsson et al . , 1993 ) . Furthermore , latent class analysis has demonstrated categorically distinct groups of creative achievement , furthering the argument for domain - speciﬁc creativity , especially in regard to creative products ( Silvia et al . , 2009 ) . Domain - general theories emphasize the generalizability of creative thinking across diﬀerent domains ( Hong and Milgram , 2010 ) . The domain general view is supported by personality studies , which suggest that there is something to the notion of a creative personality type ( Eysenck , 1993 ; Martindale and Daily , 1996 ; Feist , 1998 ; Batey and Furnham , 2006 ) , and by evidence that when people express themselves in diﬀerent creative domains these outputs bear a recognizable style or ‘voice’ ( Gabora et al . , 2012 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that the creative mind seeks to explore and express its distinctive structure and dynamics using whatever means available . In another study , when painters were instructed to paint what a particular piece of music would ‘look like’ if it were a painting , naïve participants were able to correctly identify at signiﬁcantly above chance which piece of music inspired which painting ( Ranjan , 2014 ) . Although the medium of expression was diﬀerent , something of its essence remained suﬃciently intact for people to detect a resemblance between the new creative output and its inspirational source . This suggests that , at their core , creative ideas are less domain - dependent than is widely assumed . The study supported our intuitive conviction that even when the creative output lies squarely in one domain , the creative process giving rise to it may be rooted in diﬀerent domains . Currently , many scholars espouse a less dichotomous view of creativity that incorporates both domain - speciﬁc and domain - general elements ( Kaufman and Baer , 2004b ; Plucker and Beghetto , 2004 ; Gabora , 2017 ) . Possible mechanisms underlying cross - domain creativity have been suggested ( Runco , 2009 ; Simonton , 2009 ; Sternberg , 2009 ) , and tested in empirical studies ( Boccia et al . , 2015 ; An and Runco , 2016 ; Barbot et al . , 2016 ; Palmiero et al . , 2016 , 2019 ) . However , we believe that the domain - generality of creativity is still under - appreciated due to emphasis on the ﬁnal product or output of the creative process , and a relative paucity of research on the inspiration phase of the creative process . Even if creative individuals tend to express themselves in one domain , this does not necessarily mean that prior phases of their creative process are domain - speciﬁc . An exception to the paucity of research on creative inspiration is Root - Bernstein et al . ( 1995 ) and Root - Bernstein ( 1996 , 2001 , 2003 ) work on how cross - domain inﬂuences such as artistic avocations can stimulate creativity in accomplished scientists . Our research diﬀers from Root - Bernstein’s ground - breaking work in that it aims to assess how widespread such inﬂuences are , and therefore it is not limited to individuals with established careers in one or more creative domains . This paper describes two studies designed to test the hypothesis that cross - domain inﬂuences play a normal and natural role in creativity and that cross - domain thinking constitutes a ubiquitous part of the creative process . The studies investigate possible sources of inspirations that lead to a speciﬁc creative output in both creative experts and non - experts . Honing Theory Central Aim and Core Concepts These studies are part of a larger research program developed to test , the honing theory of creativity ( HT ) . While the central aim of most theories of creativity is to account for the existence of creative products , arose to account for the cumulative , open - ended nature of cultural evolution . HT grew out of the view that humans possess two levels of complex , adaptive , self - organizing , evolving structure : an organismic level , and a psychological level ( Freeman , 1991 ; Varela et al . , 1991 ; Barton , 1994 ; Pribram , 1994 ; Combs , 1996 ; Gabora , 1998 , 2017 ) . We refer to this psychological level as a worldview : an individual’s unique dynamic web of understanding that provides a way of both seeing the world and being in the world ( i . e . , a mind as it is experienced from the inside ) . In short , HT posits that the worldview is the hub of a second evolutionary process—cultural evolution—that rides piggyback on the ﬁrst—biological evolution—and that creative thinking fuels this second evolutionary process ( Gabora , 1998 , 2004 , 2008 , 2013 , 2017 ) . Honing an idea entails reiteratively looking at it from the diﬀerent angles proﬀered by one’s particular worldview , ‘putting ones’ own spin on it by making sense of it in one’s own terms , followed by expressing it outwardly ( Gabora , 2017 ) . Honing may involve the restructuring of representations by re - encoding the problem such that new elements are perceived to be relevant , or relaxing goal constraints ( Weisberg , 1995 ) . It may also involve self - organized criticality , wherein small perturbations can have large eﬀects ( Gabora , 1998 ) . As the creator’s understanding of the task shifts , the creative idea may ﬁnd a form that ﬁts better with the worldview as a whole , such that the worldview achieves a more coherent state , as formalized by the notion of conceptual closure ( Gabora , 2000 ; Gabora and Steel , 2017 ) . Creative acts and products render such cognitive transformation culturally transmissible . Thus , it is suggested that what evolves through culture is not creative contributions but worldviews , and cultural contributions give hints about the worldviews that generate them . Predictions of HT Concerning Cross - Domain Inﬂuences HT posits that creative output reﬂects the idiosyncratic , transformative process by which a worldview restructures itself in response to perturbations such as the detection of threats , inconsistencies , ambiguity , or potentiality . Such perturbations cause arousal - provoking uncertainty , which Hirsh et al . ( 2012 ) refer to as psychological entropy . It has been proposed that psychological entropy can not only be experienced negatively as anxiety , but also positively as a force that energizes creativity , by setting self - organized iterative honing into motion ( Gabora , 2017 ) . HT posits that since the contents of the mind Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 2 June 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1426 fpsyg - 10 - 01426 June 17 , 2019 Time : 17 : 32 # 3 Scotney et al . Cross - Domain Thinking exist in a state of potentiality until evoked from memory , and the form they take when they actualize in conscious awareness is subject to modiﬁcation due to context , none are a priori excluded from the creative task . Thus , mental contents can ﬂuidly cross domain boundaries , and it is possible for the domain - speciﬁc aspects of an idea to be stripped away such that it is amenable to re - expression in another form . Because a worldview can continuously renew its overall structure , there are no limits on the possible inﬂuences or ‘conceptual parents’ of a creative work such as a song or journal article . For example , consider the situation in which a book inspires a movie , which inspires an invention . To see the thread of continuity across this ‘line of descent’ it is necessary to consider how their creators navigated through webs of beliefs , attitudes , procedural and declarative knowledge , and habitual patterns of thought and action that emerged through the interaction between personality and experience . In short , HT predicts that cross - domain inﬂuences play a role in the creative processes that fuel the self - organized transformation of worldviews , and that this in turn is the driving force of cultural evolution . Previous Research on Creative Inﬂuences There have been eﬀorts to corroborate anecdotal reports of creative inﬂuences ( see Feinstein , 2006 ) with machine learning techniques designed to resolve lines of inﬂuence ( Saleh et al . , 2014 ) . However , these techniques are not yet able to discern cross - domain inﬂuences , wherein a creator in one domain ( e . g . , art ) is inﬂuenced by another domain ( e . g . , music ) . The study of cross - domain inﬂuences on creativity has been somewhat limited and has yielded conﬂicting results ( Chan and Schunn , 2015 ) . Some researchers have found that problem solvers from outside the given domain often produce the most creative solutions ( Wiley , 1998 ; Jeppesen and Lakhani , 2010 ; Franke et al . , 2014 ) . Other evidence suggests that directly relevant information about a problem domain can increase the usefulness of a creative solution , but indirectly relevant information may enhance novelty ( Montag - Smit and Maertz , 2017 ) . Furthermore , exposure to artwork in an unfamiliar style has led to increased creativity in later artwork for novice artists ( Okada and Ishibashi , 2017 ) . Chan et al . ( 2015 ) examined the conceptual distance of inspirational sources on the quality of design ideas , and found that conceptually closer sources ( which were deﬁned as sharing a ‘topic’ of closely associated words ) were associated with higher quality solutions . However , by searching the ‘conceptual genealogies’ of concepts through analysis of cited inspirations from earlier stages in the development of the design ( ‘indirect’ sources ) , creative beneﬁt came from indirect sources with higher conceptual distance ( Chan and Schunn , 2015 ) . Since the designers were not asked to provide all elements that inspired their work , the scope of study was limited to the kinds of inﬂuences that one might logically expect to have a direct bearing on the result . Thus , for example , they listed things like previously generated solutions or design ideas , but not things like a particular piece of music , or ‘a conversation with a friend . ’ The Present Studies This paper describes two studies of the prevalence of cross - domain inﬂuence in real - world creative endeavors . 1 The ﬁrst study involves individuals who have achieved some degree of expertise and / or recognition for their creative work . The second was carried out with non - experts . STUDY 1 The goal of Study 1 was to provide a preliminary assessment of the extent to which creative outputs are inspired by within - domain inﬂuences ( i . e . , either directly related to the creator’s domain of creative expression , such as a painter’s painting inspired by another painting , or indirectly related to the creator’s domain of creative expression , such as a painter’s painting inspired by a photograph ) versus cross - domain inﬂuences ( i . e . , unrelated to the creator’s domain of creative expression , such as a painter’s painting inspired by a piece of music ) . We hypothesized that the majority of participants’ creative outputs will be inspired by cross - domain inﬂuences rather than within - domain inﬂuences . Methods Participants An internet search was conducted to locate individuals who were highly creative in any domain . They were recruited by email and invited to participate in the study on a voluntary basis . The method and recruitment email were both approved by the UBC Research Ethics Board . A total of 151 individuals participated . Procedure Participants were provided a link to an online questionnaire hosted by SurveyMonkey . The questionnaire asked their gender , age , and occupation , as well as the following open - ended questions : ( 1 ) What is the general category for the creative work for which you are most known ( e . g . , art , music , drama , science ) ? ( 2 ) What is the subcategory for the creative work for which you are most known ( e . g . , painting , piano composition , biochemistry ) ? ( 3 ) Please describe your creative outputs . ( 4 ) Please describe as best you can your creative process . ( 5 ) Describe all elements that have inspired your work ( natural or artiﬁcial , or it may be a particular event or situation , or something not in the concrete environment , that is , something abstract that you have been thinking about ) , and with each item , if possible , put as much identifying 1 Portions of these studies were published in conference proceedings . The ﬁndings presentedinStudy1includemorethantwiceasmanyresponsesasthosepresentedinGaboraandCarbert ( 2015 ) . The ﬁndings presented in both studies diﬀer from that of both conference proceedings papers ( Gabora and Carbert , 2015 ; Scotney et al . , 2018 ) because the data were subsequently recoded using naïve judges who were blind to the hypothesis of this study ( i . e . , that cross - domain inﬂuences would be widespread ) . Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 3 June 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1426 fpsyg - 10 - 01426 June 17 , 2019 Time : 17 : 32 # 4 Scotney et al . Cross - Domain Thinking information as you can about the item it inspired ( e . g . , my Sunlight Sonata in B Flat composed in 2012 was inspired by going skiing in the alps with my sister who had just recovered from pneumonia ) . Do this for as many of your creative works as you can , itemizing them as ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and so forth . Provide as much detail as possible . Question four was not used in this analysis , as we chose to focus only on the inspirational elements provided . The inﬂuences provided in response to question ﬁve were divided into four categories : cross - domain ( C ) , within - domain narrow ( WN ) , within - domain broad ( WB ) , and uncertain ( U ) . A response was classiﬁed as WN if the domain of inspiration and the domain of the creative output fell within the same subcategory ( e . g . , a painting inspired by another painting ) . An example of a WB inﬂuence is a painting inspired by a photograph . A photograph and a painting belong to the same domain of visual art , but not to the same sub - domain . Cross - domain inﬂuences were those for which the domain of the inﬂuence was diﬀerent from the domain of creative expression . For example , a poem ( domain : writing ) that inspired a piano piece ( domain : music ) was rated as a cross - domain inﬂuence . An answer was categorized as U when insuﬃcient information was provided to categorize the inﬂuence as WN , WB , or C . Examples of each category of inﬂuence in a few diﬀerent domains of creative output are provided in Table 1 . Participants did not provide examples for all domain - category combinations . The rationale for using the self - report method was that only the participants themselves would be able to know what inspired their creative outputs . Outside assessments were not used in this study ( or the next ) since we were not interested in the quality of their creative contributions , nor in how creative other people assess these participants to be . Analysis Of the 151 participants , 68 were excluded because they did not answer question ﬁve , which was the focus of our analysis . Five additional questionnaires were excluded because the raters were unable to understand the participants’ answers . This left a total of 78 participants ( 56 females and 22 males ) whose responses were analyzed . Nearly 58 % of the participants were age 50 or older , and half of them worked in art / design . The participants TABLE 1 | Examples of categories of inﬂuence for different types of creative outputs ( Study 1 ) .

A dash indicates no example was present for that category . provided a total of 298 inﬂuences , and the average number of inﬂuences provided by each participant was 3 . 82 ( SD = 2 . 29 , Mdn = 3 . 00 , range : 1 – 10 ) . Two naïve raters independently categorized these responses as either WN , WB , C , or U . The raters were undergraduate psychology students who were blind to the hypothesis behind this study . One was recruited by voluntarily responding to an online recruitment poster listed in UBC Okanagan’s Psychology Course Union website , and the other was recruited through the same poster in a Facebook group for a psychology research methods course . Initially , the raters were provided with detailed instructions and examples for rating the listed inﬂuences . These instructions and examples are provided in the Supplementary Materials . The examples provided not only the rating that would be given for an example response , but the reasoning that would lead to the coding decision . The four category deﬁnitions given to the raters are provided in Table 2 . The raters were then asked to categorize 10 responses , which were reviewed to ensure that they understood the task , before proceeding to code the rest of the questionnaires . The percentage of agreement between the two raters was 86 . 24 % . Cohen’s kappa for the two raters was moderate , κ = 0 . 58 , but improved when partial weights were assigned to the WN / WB categories to increase the tolerance for disagreement when both raters assigned the inﬂuence to a within - domain category , κ = 0 . 64 , showing substantial agreement ( Landis and Koch , 1977 ) . The raters resolved all disagreements through a phone - call discussion , so that each inﬂuence was assigned to only one category . After discussion , raters were more likely to have coded each response as C , WN , or WB , and rarely used the U category . Results As shown in Table 2 , the frequency of cross - domain inﬂuences ( 80 . 54 % ) was vastly greater than that of within - domain TABLE 2 | Deﬁnitions of categories of inﬂuence ( Studies 1 and 2 ) . Within - domain narrow ( WN ) : When the domain of the creative inspiration and the creative output are from the same subcategory , mark the inspiration as WN ( e . g . , when a painting was inspired by another painting , or a song was inspired by a different song ) . Within - domain broad ( WB ) : When the domain of the creative inspiration is in the same category as the creative output , but not the same subcategory , mark the inspiration as WB [ e . g . , when a painting is inspired by a photograph ( both in the category of visual arts ) , or when a song is inspired by a musician ( the inﬂuence is clearly related to the output , but not the same thing ) ] . Cross - domain ( C ) : When the inspiration is unrelated to the category of the creative output , mark the inspiration as C ( e . g . , when a software program is inspired by a song , or when a story is inspired by an emotion ) . Unclear ( U ) : When there is not enough information given to determine whether the inﬂuence is within or cross domain , mark the inspiration as U [ e . g . , when celebration of recovery from injury inspires a dance ( it could be within domain if the injury , a physical limitation , is seen as related to the physical movement of dance , or it could be cross domain if the emotion of celebration is seen as something unrelated to the category of performance ) ] . Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 4 June 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1426 fpsyg - 10 - 01426 June 17 , 2019 Time : 17 : 32 # 5 Scotney et al . Cross - Domain Thinking inﬂuences , even when both broad and narrow within - domain inﬂuences were considered ( 17 . 78 % ) . Of the 78 participants , 76 ( 97 . 44 % ) provided at least one cross - domain inspiration in their answer . This indicates that cross - domain sources of inspiration occur frequently for highly creative individuals . Since participants were encouraged to list all of the inﬂuences they could think of that inspired their creative outputs , there was variation in the number of inﬂuences that each participant provided . A possible explanation for the low frequency of WN inﬂuences ( 7 . 72 % ) could be that there is often only one WN inﬂuence that can match a given creative output , but there is a larger number of WB inﬂuences , and a potentially inﬁnite number of C inﬂuences . Thus , once someone has provided an inﬂuence that matches the domain of the creative output , any subsequent inﬂuences they provide are more likely to be either cross - domain or within - domain broad . To explore the possibility that our results gave more weight to participants who reported multiple inﬂuences , we also analyzed the data according to the number of inﬂuences provided by each participant . The breakdown of data by the participants who gave the same number of inﬂuences ( Table 3 ) shows that this was not driving the pattern of results . Cross - domain inspiration remained consistently at or above 68 % for every number of inﬂuence provided . Therefore , our results show a consistently greater occurrence of cross - domain inﬂuences than within domain inﬂuences , and this result is not dependent on the number of inﬂuences provided by a participant . The result of a chi - square test conducted for the result of those who gave only one inﬂuence showed that the diﬀerence in frequency of each category was signiﬁcant , χ 2 ( 3 ) = 45 , p < 0 . 001 . Due to the non - independence of the data , no signiﬁcance testing was conducted for the diﬀerences in frequency for those who contributed two or more inﬂuences . Instead , we present the frequency of the occurrence of each category for our analysis . TABLE 3 | Frequency and percentage of categories of inﬂuence by number of inﬂuences provided by participant .

Discussion These results demonstrate that even if individuals primarily express their creativity in a single domain , they are often employing cross - domain thinking when they create . This study enriches our understanding of how the creative process works and adds to the growing body of evidence that creativity is much more than a matter of acquiring domain - speciﬁc expertise . STUDY 2 The results of Study 1 prompted speculation as to whether or not the impact of cross - domain inﬂuences was limited to individuals with expertise in a particular creative domain . The goal of Study 2 was to assess whether the ability to develop creative works that employ cross - domain inﬂuences only comes online after the tools and techniques of a particular domain have been mastered , or whether it generalizes to individuals without expertise in a creative domain . Thus , the study investigated the hypothesis that regardless of one’s expertise in a creative domain , creative outputs will be inspired by cross - domain inﬂuences . Methods Participants The sample included 463 undergraduate students ( 114 males , 347 females , and 2 who selected ‘no or diﬀerent gender’ ) from the University of British Columbia . They were recruited through SONA , an online participant pool approved by the UBC Research Ethics Board . Participants were granted one course credit ( equal to 1 % of their grade ) for their participation in this study . Procedure The SONA website provided a link to an online questionnaire hosted by FluidSurvey . The procedure and questions followed the same format as Study 1 . Analysis Of the 463 participants , 111 were excluded because they left one or more of the written - response questions blank . ( They were able to receive course credit whether or not they completed the questionnaire . ) An additional 90 questionnaires were excluded because the participants did not provide classiﬁable answers to question ﬁve . Some of the questionnaires were unclassiﬁable because participants either provided a description of their creative process , or answered with what motivated a creative output , rather than providing an inspiration ( e . g . , an answer was excluded if the only reason for engaging in the creative activity was that someone else , such as a parent , obliged them to participate ) . The second category of unclassiﬁable questionnaires were those in which no creative outputs were provided in conjunction with a creative inﬂuence . The last category of unclassiﬁable questionnaires were those for which the raters found them incomprehensible and impossible to evaluate . This reduced the sample to 262 complete questionnaires for analysis ( 196 females , 65 males , and one who selected ‘no or diﬀerent gender’ ) , and these questionnaires provided a total of 758 Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 5 June 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1426 fpsyg - 10 - 01426 June 17 , 2019 Time : 17 : 32 # 6 Scotney et al . Cross - Domain Thinking inﬂuences . Each participant listed an average of 2 . 89 creative inﬂuences ( SD = 1 . 92 , Mdn = 3 , range : 1 – 15 ) . Nearly all participants ( 95 . 80 % ) were under the age of 30 . Two naïve raters independently categorized these responses as either WN , WB , C , or U . Both raters were undergraduate psychology students that were recruited using the same strategy employed in Study 1 . ( One rater assisted with the data from both studies . ) The percentage of agreement between the two raters was 78 . 10 % . Cohen’s kappa for two raters was moderate , κ = 0 . 50 , but improved when partial weights were assigned to the WN / WB categories as in Study 1 , κ = 0 . 56 ( Landis and Koch , 1977 ) . The raters resolved all disagreements through discussion , so that each inﬂuence was assigned to only one category . A participant’s response to question 1 ( their creative domain ) was referenced alongside the types of output they recorded in question 5 in order to assign a general creative domain to each participant . We used nine categories in total . Participants who reported two or more outputs from diﬀerent creative domains were categorized as ‘Multiple Domains . ’ ‘Sport’ included dance and gymnastics , as well as team sports . ‘Art’ included sculpting , painting , and drawing . ‘Design’ included diﬀerent types of design , such as fashion design , and interior design . ‘Other’ included those who did not ﬁt into another category , such as ‘Law’ or ‘Administration . ’ Results The total number of inﬂuences in each category of inﬂuence , as well as the distribution among participants who gave the same number of inﬂuences , are provided in Table 4 . The participants’ creative outputs came from a variety of domains , including drawing , architecture , photography , scientiﬁc experiments , song writing , furniture design , biochemistry , and athletic performance . They also gave a wide variety of inspirational sources , ranging from people in their lives such as family , friends , and strangers , to African safaris and The Book of Kells . The results were highly consistent with those of Study 1 . Of the 758 inﬂuences provided , 107 ( 14 . 12 % ) were WN , 81 ( 10 . 69 % ) were WB , and 564 ( 74 . 41 % ) were C . Thus , cross - domain inﬂuences constituted three times the number of within - domain inﬂuences , even when broad as well as narrow within - domain inﬂuences were included ( 24 . 80 % ) . Of the 262 participants , 222 of them ( 84 . 73 % ) provided at least one cross - domain inﬂuence . Similar to Study 1 , regardless of the number of inﬂuences provided , at least 64 % of them were cross - domain . A chi - square test for the result of those who gave one inﬂuence showed that the diﬀerence in frequency of each category was signiﬁcant , χ 2 ( 3 ) = 64 . 59 , p < 0 . 001 . Table 5 presents the occurrence of the diﬀerent categories of inﬂuence for individuals in diﬀerent creative domains , arranged from the highest frequency of cross - domain inﬂuences to the lowest . Although comparisons should be made cautiously due to large diﬀerences in the sizes of the subsamples , the results suggest that cross - domain inﬂuences are slightly less common in Sport and Drama ( 58 . 54 % and 58 . 33 % , respectively ) , and most frequent for Writers and Artists ( 88 . 89 % and 77 . 93 % , TABLE 4 | Frequency and percentage of categories of inﬂuence by number of inﬂuences provided by participant .

However , it is important to note that for every category of creativity assessed in our sample , cross - domain inﬂuences were reported more frequently than any within - domain sources of inspiration . One possible reason for the high number of cross - domain inﬂuences for artists and writers is that in these domains creative expression is highly valued , while works that are closely related to previous books / paintings may be derided for their lack of creativity . Moreover , individuals may be speciﬁcally drawn to these domains because this kind of expression is accepted and even encouraged . In other domains , it may be more important to draw upon the ideas and methods of previous creators , resulting in more within - domain inﬂuences . Cross - domain inﬂuences for ‘Sport’ in our sample may be due to dancing being included in this category , and common inﬂuences for dance included music , lyrics , and emotions ( all cross - domain ) .

Cross - Domain Thinking samples of diﬀerent creative domains may be able to examine the distinctions within these domains more closely ( e . g . , to distinguish ﬁction from poetry or research papers , or to separate dance from soccer ) . Discussion The results of this study concur with those of Study 1 in that the majority of creative outputs were inspired by cross - domain inﬂuences . In addition , Study 2 shows that this is not only the case for individuals with proven success or expertise in a creative domain , but holds true for non - experts as well . Except for WN , the conﬁdence intervals from the two studies overlap , indicating that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the results of Study 1 and Study 2 ( see Figure 1 ) . GENERAL DISCUSSION Implications for a Theoretical Framework for Creativity This result has implications for our understanding of the creative process , because it demonstrates that it is substantially less domain - speciﬁc than it is widely presumed to be . Even if individuals primarily express their creativity in a single domain , they are often employing cross - domain thinking when they create . Although domain - speciﬁc knowledge may ensure that tools of the trade are appropriately applied , and one’s creative works may consistently be in one particular domain , the sources that initially triggered these creative processes may be diverse in nature . To the extent that this is the case , creativity may involve synthesizing information from diﬀerent arenas of one’s life . This is consistent with high levels of functional connectivity amongst the default , salience , and FIGURE 1 | Percentages of the categories of inﬂuence in Study 1 and Study 2 . Error bars represent 95 % conﬁdence interval . WN , within - domain narrow ; WB , within - domain broad ; C , cross - domain ; U , uncertain . executive neural circuits in creative individuals during creative thinking ( Beaty et al . , 2018 ) . Although the phenomenon of cross - domain inﬂuence in creativity—and by implication , the abstraction and re - expression of abstract forms—may seem obvious to artists , it plays little role in the bulk of psychology , computational creativity , and AI research , in which creativity is commonly treated as heuristically guided search or selection amongst discrete , well - deﬁned states , guided by domain - speciﬁc expertise ( e . g . , Weisberg , 1995 ; Simonton , 2010 ) . The ﬁnding that cross - domain inﬂuences are widespread is consistent with HT , according to which it is not just one’s conception of the creative task ( or ‘problem domain’ ) but one’s worldview as an integrated whole that transforms—becoming less fragmented and / or more robust—through immersion in a creative task . Honing entails iteratively viewing the creative task from a new context , which may restructure the internal conception of it , and this restructuring may be amenable to external expression . This external change may in turn suggest a new context , and so forth recursively , until the task is complete . The view that creative honing can bring about sweeping changes to an individual’s second ( psychological ) level of complex , adaptive structure is consistent with ﬁndings that creativity is potentially therapeutic ( Barron , 1963 ; Forgeard , 2013 ) , and that through immersion in a creative task , a more stable image of the world , and one’s own relation to it , can emerge ( Pelaprat and Cole , 2011 ) . Thus , it is through the interaction and cross - fertilization of knowledge and ideas that a more integrated understanding of the world is achieved ( Gabora , 1998 ; Gabora and Steel , 2017 ) , and psychological entropy ( Hirsh et al . , 2012 ; Gabora , 2017 ) kept to an acceptable minimum . Implications for Cultural Evolution At ﬁrst glance it might seem that the basic units of cultural evolution ( i . e . , the cultural equivalent of the organism in biological evolution ) are such things as catchy songs , rituals , or tools . However , the above evidence for the cross - fertilization of diﬀerent domains suggests that the only way to delineate the cultural lineage of a given idea is to look to the creator’s entire loosely integrated web of knowledge and understandings ( i . e . , the creative process transforms not just the problem domain but the worldview as a whole ) . In this way , the inspirational sources— or ‘conceptual parents’—of a sad ballad could include everything from other musicians , to the patter of rain , to the death of a loved one . Thus , creative products don’t just serve practical purposes or provide aesthetic pleasure ; they provide tangible external markers of the evolutionary states of the worldviews that generated them . This is consistent with the theory that what evolves through culture is , not creative outputs like songs or tools , but worldviews , with creative outputs as the externally visible ‘excrement’ of this transformation process ( Gabora , 2004 , 2008 , 2013 ) . In short , research into cross - domain inﬂuences has implications for not just how the creative process works but for how culture evolves . As discussed elsewhere , a worldview not only self - organizes in response to perturbations but it is imperfectly reconstituted and passed down through culture ( Gabora , 2013 ) . This is because it is not just self - organizing but self - regenerating : Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 7 June 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1426 fpsyg - 10 - 01426 June 17 , 2019 Time : 17 : 32 # 8 Scotney et al . Cross - Domain Thinking people share experiences , ideas , and attitudes with each other , thereby inﬂuencing the process by which other worldviews form and transform . Children expose elements of what was originally an adult’s worldview to diﬀerent experiences , diﬀerent bodily constraints , and thereby forge unique internal models of the relationship between self and world . In short , worldviews transform by interleaving ( 1 ) internal interactions amongst their parts , and ( 2 ) external interactions with others , and it is through these social interactions that novelty accumulates , and culture evolves . Limitations and Future Directions We attribute the large fraction of respondents who did not complete the questionnaire to the anonymous nature of the study . In future studies , it would be helpful to consider ways of further incentivizing participants to complete the questionnaire . Although the open - ended nature of the questionnaire was necessary to enable participants to provide anything as an inspirational source , it may have been less inviting for those who prefer a structured format . Changing the format from an online questionnaire to an in - person interview may elicit a higher response rate . In addition , the instructions should actively discourage participants from providing motives ( e . g . , a desire to be creative ) instead of inspirational sources , and examples of each should be given so that the distinction is clear . Also , reformatting the questionnaire so that it is always clear which creative inﬂuence is associated with which creative output would help clarify the interpretation of the responses . A limitation of the self - report format is that participants might not accurately remember , or report the inspirations for their creative works . Related to this is that the open - ended nature of participants’ responses meant that they varied in detail and in the extent to which they actually responded to the particular question that was asked . However , we believe the methods chosen matched the goals for this study . There is no easy or standardized way of examining the creative inﬂuences of others . Our goal was to obtain the most information from each participant possible by allowing them to respond in their own words , with as much detail as possible , rather than to limit their responses by a more formalized structure such as a survey . Our study showed that when people self - report their creative inspirations , cross - domain inﬂuences are frequently reported . Besides the above - mentioned ideas , other possible future methods could include the identiﬁcation of a creative output , and then to approach the creator for an explanation of their inﬂuences for that particular output . This study also made no eﬀort to measure or control for the creativity of the outputs , but this variable could be explored in future studies , to assess its relation to the domains of inﬂuence . Another suggestion for future work would be to add a second , within - domain example to the instructions , such as “My Sonata was inﬂuenced by my recent obsession with Beethoven’s Pathetique . ” We note as another limitation that the gender balance was skewed toward females , and Study 1 participants tended to be older than Study 2 participants . The age diﬀerence arose largely from the diﬃculty of ﬁnding accomplished creative professionals under age 30 . In future studies it would be advisable to endeavor to obtain a more equal gender balance and age distribution to ensure that these factors do not aﬀect the results . An important direction for future research is to investigate the timing and underlying mechanisms of cross - domain inﬂuence . In the studies reported here , participants were prompted to focus on the inspiration for their creative outputs , but we note that cross - domain inﬂuences are not necessarily exclusive to the inspiration phase of the creative process . To better understand the frequency and timing of cross - domain thinking in the creative process , further research needs to be done on other phases of the creative process , and the process as a whole . In regards to the mechanisms of cross - domain inﬂuence , Boccia et al . ( 2015 ) provide evidence that creativity and divergent thinking in visual , musical , and verbal domains are underpinned by speciﬁc brain areas , but also share a common brain system . This suggests that our cross - domain results may be due to a ‘general’ cognitive process or brain structure that people use while creating , regardless of domain . However , since Boccia et al . ( 2015 ) did not diﬀerentiate between the initial creative inspiration and other phases of the creative process ( e . g . , execution ) , it is diﬃcult to fully assess the relevance of Boccia et al . ’s ( 2015 ) analysis to the results reported here . Another direction is to investigate the hypothesis that individuals in some creative domains make less use of cross - domain inﬂuences than others ( e . g . , scientists use less cross - domain inﬂuences than artists ) , and explore the eﬀect of diﬀerent types of inﬂuence on the level of creative output within that domain . For example , within - domain inﬂuences may be important for a ﬁeld such as science , where domain - speciﬁc knowledge is essential ( Bermejo et al . , 2016 ) , but cross - domain inﬂuences may be associated with greater creativity within this domain . Further research could also investigate developmental diﬀerences in the ability to employ cross - domain inﬂuences . Future research could investigate the factors that predispose individuals to employ cross - domain inﬂuences , such as their implicit conception of how the creative process works . Another direction for future research is to investigate the extent to which the application of cross - domain inﬂuences is associated with personality traits correlated with creativity , such as norm - doubting , high aspiration levels , tolerance of ambiguity , and openness to experience ( Eysenck , 1993 ; Helson , 1996 ; Martindale and Daily , 1996 ; Batey and Furnham , 2006 ) . If so , this would suggest that propensity toward cross - domain inﬂuence plays a mediating role between personality and creativity . Practical Implications The ﬁnding that the majority of creative outputs were inspired by cross - domain inﬂuences has implications for the development of practices that promote creativity in education , the workplace , and personal life . There is an international trend toward streamlining classwork and content to the basics , and reducing or eliminating classes in the arts . Educational systems are increasingly geared toward providing much in the way of information but little in the way of examples of , or opportunities to cultivate , creative thinking skills . The results of this study suggest that creativity may be cultivated by interdisciplinary courses , as well as activities that foster connections between diﬀerent domains , such as Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 8 June 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1426 fpsyg - 10 - 01426 June 17 , 2019 Time : 17 : 32 # 9 Scotney et al .
