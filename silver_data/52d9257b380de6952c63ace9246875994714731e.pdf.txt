Using continuum wormlike chain models , we in - vestigate the fracture of semiﬂexible polymers via thermal bending ﬂuctuations , focusing on the role of ﬁlament ﬂexibility and dynamics . Our results highlight a previously unappreciated consequence of mechanical heterogeneity in the ﬁlament , which enhances the rate of thermal fragmentation par - ticularly in cases where constraints hinder the movement of the chain ends . Although generally applicable to semiﬂexible chains with regions of diﬀerent bending stiﬀness , the model is motivated by a speciﬁc biophysical system : the enhanced severing of actin ﬁlaments at the boundary between stiﬀ bare regions and mechanically softened regions that are coated with coﬁlin regulatory proteins . The results presented here point to a potential mechanism for disassembly of polymeric materials in general and cytoskeletal actin networks in particular by the introduction of locally softened chain regions , as occurs with coﬁlin binding . 1 . INTRODUCTION The fracture properties of polymeric solids pose a key constraint on the manufacture and design of a vast ar - ray of man - made materials for load - bearing or weather - resistant purposes [ 1 , 2 ] . Furthermore , polymeric materi - als serve as some of the most important structural and information - bearing components in living organisms , and their rupture ( whether through mechanical or environ - mental stress or through regulated turnover ) has a cru - cial role to play in biological processes ranging from cell division [ 3 ] , to tumorigenesis [ 4 ] , to cell motility [ 5 ] . The - oretical and experimental explorations of failure mech - anisms have established that the fracture of polymeric solids relies in large part on the scission of individ - ual polymer ﬁlaments , with the dynamics and stress - dependence of fracture governed by the kinetics of molec - ular rupture [ 1 , 6 , 7 ] . At the molecular scale , fracture is inherently a thermal process , where the activation en - ergy is lowered by the application of stress on individual bonds along the ﬁlament [ 7 ] . Fragmentation of a polymer ﬁlament is accelerated when externally applied stresses become locally concen - trated in speciﬁc regions . This principle underlies , for instance , the fragmentation of DNA at discrete folding points under extensional ﬂow [ 8 ] , the rupture of micro - tubules through buckling during spindle reorganization [ 9 ] and traumatic axonal injury [ 10 ] , and the severing of actin bundles by myosin - driven compression in motile cells [ 11 , 12 ] . Local discontinuities in mechanical proper - ties tend to concentrate externally applied stress , leading to preferential fracture of materials at these discontinu - ous regions [ 13 , 14 ] . In the case of thermally driven fracture , the eﬀect of mechanical inhomogeneities in a ﬁlament is poorly un - ∗ ekoslover @ ucsd . edu derstood . Prior theoretical work showed that thermal en - ergy is equally partitioned among spatial degrees of free - dom in general equilibrium one - dimensional systems [ 15 ] . However , fracture is inherently a transient , kinetic pro - cess . Understanding fracture rates requires moving be - yond equilibrium distributions to consider the dynamics of thermal ﬂuctuations in a polymer ﬁlament . Here we focus on the role of spatial heterogeneity of mechanical properties in accelerating thermally induced fracture of semiﬂexible chains . The general problem of fracture rates in a thermal - ized , mechanically heterogeneous , polymer ﬁlament is motivated in part by a biological system : the coﬁlin - mediated severing of cytoskeletal actin ﬁlaments . Actin is a semiﬂexible polymer that forms bundles and networks responsible for maintaining cell - scale mechanical prop - erties as well as driving processes such as lamellipodial motility , cytokinesis , and embryonic patterning [ 16 , 17 ] . Much of the biological behavior of actin networks re - lies on the dynamic turnover of individual actin ﬁla - ments , which is accelerated by the actin - binding pro - tein coﬁlin . Coﬁlin assembles cooperatively along actin chains , locally decreasing their bending stiﬀness and re - sulting in mechanically heterogeneous partially decorated ﬁlaments [ 18 – 22 ] . Such ﬁlaments fragment , without ad - ditional energy input , preferentially at the boundary of coﬁlinated segments [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] . While missing bonds at these discontinuities may account for their increased fragility , particularly under stress [ 25 ] , an additional con - tribution to enhanced severing has been proposed that relies on the concentration of stress at the discontinu - ities between coﬁlinated and bare actin segments [ 14 , 25 ] . Here , we explore the physical plausibility of enhanced fracture at a junction between soft and stiﬀ regions , in a purely thermal system ( ie : in the absence of externally applied compressive forces ) . a r X i v : 190 5 . 03327v2 [ c ond - m a t . s t a t - m ec h ] 12 A ug 2019 2 2 . MECHANICAL MODEL FOR HETEROGENEOUS FILAMENT We consider the thermally driven fracture of a mechan - ically heterogeneous ﬁlament , by building upon the well - established continuum “worm - like chain” ( WLC ) model for semiﬂexible polymers [ 26 , 27 ] . Prior work on the sta - tistical mechanics of heterogeneous and kinked worm - like chains has established a framework for analytically calcu - lating their distribution functions [ 28 – 30 ] . Here we focus on the simplest heterogeneous chain : a diblock copoly - mer consisting of two WLC of equal length L and bend - ing persistence lengths (cid:96) p , 1 ≥ (cid:96) p , 2 . The chains are grafted together at a point junction ( Fig . 1a ) , whose bending en - ergy is deﬁned as 1 k b T E junc = κ ( 1 − ρ ) , ρ = cos θ , ( 1 ) where k b T is the thermal energy and θ is the bending angle between chain tangents at the junction . The junc - tion represents a short portion of the chain of length ∆ , with ∆ (cid:28) L . In our model , this junction is treated as a single point with stiﬀness κ = (cid:96) p , 1 / ∆ . In particular , we note that this junction represents the behavior of the last short segment of stiﬀ chain just before the attachment of the softer chain . The mechanics of the heterogeneous chain are fully deﬁned by three dimensionless parameters : chain half - length N = L / ( 2 (cid:96) p , 1 ) , junction length ˆ∆ = ∆ / L = 1 / ( 2 κN ) , and heterogeneity h = (cid:96) p , 1 / (cid:96) p , 2 . The overall partition function [ G tot ( (cid:126)R , ρ ) ] for this model is computed from prior results derived for worm - like chains with end constraints [ 27 , 30 , 31 ] . We start with the partition function [ ˆ G ( (cid:126)R , (cid:126)u ; L , (cid:96) p ) ] for a WLC chain or length L , persistence length (cid:96) p , with one end at the ori - gin , the other end at position (cid:126)R , and ﬁnal end tangent (cid:126)u . After a Fourier transform from (cid:126)R to (cid:126)k , this function is given by : (cid:98) G ( (cid:126) k , (cid:126)u ; L , (cid:96) p ) = 1 4 π ∞ (cid:88) l = 0 G 0 , l (cid:18) 2 (cid:96) p k , L 2 (cid:96) p (cid:19) P l ( (cid:126)u · (cid:126) k ) , ( 2 ) where P l are Legendre polynomials and the G ml 0 , l f co - eﬃcients refer to previously deﬁned continued fraction terms [ 27 ] . For a heterogeneous wormlike chain with end - to - end vector (cid:126)R and junction angle θ , the partition func - tion is obtained from the convolution of two such propa - gators G tot ( (cid:126)R , ρ ; L , (cid:96) p , 1 , (cid:96) p , 2 ) = (cid:90) d(cid:126)R j d(cid:126)u j dφ ˆ G ( (cid:126)R j , (cid:126)u j ; L , (cid:96) p , 1 ) × ˆ G ( (cid:126)R − (cid:126)R j , (cid:126) Ω ( θ , φ ) · u j ; L , (cid:96) p , 2 ) ( 3 ) where (cid:126)R j is junction position , (cid:126)u j is the incoming tan - gent to the junction , and Ω ( φ , θ ) is a rotation matrix that rotates the cannonical coordinate system by Euler angles ( φ , θ , 0 ) . The Fourier transform in space , together with an application of the spherical harmonic addition theorem [ 32 ] , allows this convolution to be simpliﬁed to : (cid:98) G tot ( (cid:126)k , ρ ; N , 1 , h ) = 1 2 ∞ (cid:88) (cid:96) = 0 P l ( ρ ) G 0 , l ( k , N ) G 0 , l (cid:18) k h , hN (cid:19) , ( 4 ) where we have nondimensionalized all length units by 2 (cid:96) p , 1 . Finally , the Fourier inversion is computed accord - ing to [ 31 ] G tot ( (cid:126)R , ρ ) = 1 ( 2 π 2 ) ( 2 (cid:96) p , 1 ) 3 (cid:90) ∞ 0 dk k sin ( 2 kNr ) 2 Nr (cid:98) G tot ( k , ρ ) , ( 5 ) where r = | R | / ( 2 L ) is the normalized end separation of the joint chain . This propagator is normalized such that (cid:82) d(cid:126)RG tot ( (cid:126)R , ρ ) = 1 for each value of ρ . The free energy ( F ) of the chain is then deﬁned as the log of the partition function , with an additional term for the bending of the junction angle . Namely , 1 k b T F ( r , ρ ) = κ ( 1 − ρ ) − log (cid:2) r 2 G tot ( r , ρ ) (cid:3) ( 6 ) This free energy landscape is plotted in Fig . 1 for a ho - mogeneous , stiﬀ chain and a heterogeneous chain . We focus on ﬁlament fracture at the junction point , assuming that fracture will occur when thermal ﬂuctua - tions push the junction energy ( E junc ) above some pre - deﬁned cutoﬀ ( E ∗ ) . This model represents a fracture process where the junction must hop over a transition energy barrier , with the cosine of the bending angle ρ as the reaction coordinate . Chains with a more ﬂexi - ble junction ( lower κ ) will have to reach more extreme junction bending ( ρ ∗ = 1 − E ∗ / κ ) than chains with a more stiﬀ junction ( higher κ ) . This model is consistent with previous analyses of experimental data on fracture of short coﬁlin - decorated actin ﬁlaments that points to fracture occuring beyond a critical bending angle that in - creases with lower ﬁlament persistence length [ 21 ] . Criti - cal energies of approximately 22kT have been estimated for the severing of bare actin ﬁlaments [ 21 ] . The overall rate of fracture is obtained from the mean ﬁrst passage time ( MFPT ) to the critical value ρ ∗ , as the system ﬂuctuates thermally over the free energy land - scape plotted in Fig . 1 . The kinetics of fracture are thus determined by a free energy barrier incorporating both the junction bending energy and the conﬁgurational free energy of the worm - like chains . For a homogeneously stiﬀ chain , surmounting this barrier along the minimum en - ergy path requires bringing the ends of the chain closer together ( Fig . 1c ) . For the heterogeneous chain , by con - trast , the cutoﬀ junction angle can be reached without substantial change in the end - to - end distance ( Fig . 1d ) . The importance of this eﬀect in determining the overall time to fracture depends on the dynamics of the end - to - end coordinate r compared to the dynamics of the junction angle . 3 Figure 1 .

DYNAMICS OVER FREE ENERGY LANDSCAPE To calculate kinetics over the free energy landscape , we make the simplifying assumption that for each value of the end distance r , the kinetics of transition to the cutoﬀ ρ ∗ can be described by a single time - scale — the mean ﬁrst passage time τ ( ρ ∗ ; r ) along a horizontal slice of the landscape . Dynamics along the angular coordinate are deﬁned by a variable friction coeﬃcient that depends on the value of the junction angle , ζ ( ρ ) = k B T D ( 0 ) ρ 5 − 3 ρ 6 ( 1 − ρ 2 ) ( 7 ) where D ( 0 ) ρ = k B T µ ∆ 3 and µ is the translational friction coeﬃcient per unit length of the chain . This expression is derived from the dynamics of two connected rigid links ( Appendix A ) . We note that the numerical prefactor in the friction coeﬃcient ( Eq . 7 ) depends on mapping from the behavior of two rigid links to the dynamics of a point - like kink representing a short length of semiﬂexible chain . This prefactor is not directly determined by our theory , and we ﬁt the appropriate length of links to establish this mapping ( speciﬁcally , (cid:96) link = 2∆ ) by matching the theory to Brownian dynamics simulations of semiﬂexible chains , as described below . This is the only ﬁtting parameter in the model , a single value ( as shown in Eq . 7 ) is used for all results described . The mean ﬁrst passage time over a one - dimensional landscape can be computed from the Fokker - Planck equation [ 33 – 35 ] , appropriately modiﬁed for spatially varying diﬀusivity [ 36 ] ( Appendix B ) . Speciﬁcally , the fracture time for a ﬁxed value of r is given by τ ( ρ ∗ , r ) = 1 (cid:82) 1 ρ ∗ e − F ( r , ρ ) / k b T dρ × × (cid:20)(cid:90) 1 ρ ∗ dρ (cid:90) ρ ρ ∗ dρ (cid:48) (cid:90) 1 ρ (cid:48) dρ (cid:48)(cid:48) ζ ( ρ (cid:48) ) k b T e ( F ( r , ρ (cid:48) ) − F ( r , ρ (cid:48)(cid:48) ) − F ( ρ ) ) / k b T (cid:21) . ( 8 ) Brownian dynamics simulations of a discretized WLC model are used to validate our calculations of the mean ﬁrst passage time for ﬁxed values of the end distance , with the free energy landscape given by Eq . 6 and the friction coeﬃcient in Eq . 7 . As shown in Fig . 2a , the continuum chain theory accurately reproduces the kinet - ics of reaching a high junction angle in simulations . The overall mean ﬁrst passage time to fracture can be computed by considering a system that ﬂuctuates over discrete states in the normalized end distance , with state i corresponding to r i = iδr , and the discretization set to δr = 0 . 01 . The system is assumed to start in thermal equilibrium , with the probability of starting in state i set by a Boltzmann factor corresponding to the free energy of that state : F i = − k B T log (cid:82) dρ exp [ − F ( r i , ρ ) / k B T ] . Transitions between states occur with rate constants k ( ± ) i , given by k ( ± ) i = k R δr 2 ( F i ± 1 − F i ) exp ( F i ± 1 − F i ) − 1 , ( 9 ) as derived from a discretization of the Fokker - Planck equation [ 37 ] . The dynamic prefactor is taken to be the time - scale for three - dimensional translational diﬀusion of a chain of length L over a length scale ∆ R = 2 Lδr , ac - cording to : k R δr 2 = 6 k B T ( µL ) ( 2 Lδr ) 2 . ( 10 ) This approximate model for dynamics in the end - to - end distance gives comparable results to Brownian dy - namics simulations that sample the average time required to reach a cutoﬀ end - to - end distance for chains starting in thermal equilibrium ( Fig . 2b ) . These simulations are compared against an analytical model for dynamics over a discrete one - dimensional landscape [ 38 ] , with the tran - sition rates given by Eq . 9 , 10 . To put together both dimensions of the energy land - scape , we treat fracture as a Poissonian process within each particular end - distance state , with average time 4 Figure 2 .

( b ) MFPT to a cutoﬀ value of the normalized end - to - end distance r . ( c ) MFPT to a junction energy E ∗ , with free chain ends . In all cases , dashed black lines correspond to ﬁrst passage times calculated from the free energy landscapes , solid lines correspond to Brownian dynamics simulations . All times are non - dimensionalized by D ( 0 ) ρ . Top panels show example start and end conﬁgurations , with junction color indicating energy at the junction . given by τ i = τ ( ρ ∗ , r i ) . We compute the overall mean time to fracture for a system that ﬂuctuates over these states using a matrix inversion method , as described in previous work on the kinetics of systems with ﬂuctuating rates [ 38 ] . This approach for representing the dynamics of the system as movement over a two - dimensional free energy landscape is validated by comparison to Brow - nian dynamics simulations with unconstrained homoge - neous chains ( Appendix C ; Supplemental Videos 1 , 2 ) . As shown in Fig . 2c , Our model of dynamic ﬂuctuations over a two - dimensional energy landscape thus appears to accurately represent the behavior of simulated chains , with respect to the time required for a junction region to hit a cutoﬀ angle . 4 . FRACTURE RATES FOR HETEROGENEOUS CHAINS The overall time to fracture is dependent on the rel - ative rate of motion in the end - to - end distance as com - pared to the rate of junction ﬂuctuations ( Fig . 3a ) . For the case of very rapid end equilibration ( high k R / D ( 0 ) ρ ) , the chain would be expected to sample all end positions over a time - scale that is short compared to the fracture time . In this limit , the fracture dynamics are determined entirely by the stiﬀness and friction coeﬃcient for the junction bending ( ρ ) and are independent of the mechan - ical properties of the rest of the chain . The opposite regime holds when the dynamics of the end distance are much slower than those of the junction angle . In this case , the end distance remains constant at its starting value , and the mean time to fracture is the weighted average of the individual τ i . Softer mechanics in one half of the chain make it more probable that a lower value of r will initially be selected from the equilibrium distribution . This lower r persists over time and allows the junction to more rapidly reach the cutoﬀ angle . Fig . 3b , c show the mean time to fracture for chains with diﬀerent degrees of heterogeneity h in the case of ﬁxed end - to - end distance ( inﬁnitely slow r dynamics ) . In this limit , a purely stiﬀ chain will be slow to reach fracture at the junction because a higher overall chain deformation energy is required to bend the junction to the point of fracture . A purely soft chain will also be slow to reach fracture because the requisite junction an - gle θ ∗ to achieve the same cutoﬀ energy will be corre - spondingly larger [ 21 ] . Rapid fracture can be achieved by a heterogeneous chain , where the junction stiﬀness and hence the cutoﬀ angle are set by the stiﬀ side of the chain , while the low persistence length of the soft side enables the junction to reach that cutoﬀ angle without moving the chain ends or incurring a substantial cost in chain deformation energy . The enhancement due to chain het - erogeneity can reach several orders of magnitude in cases where the junction must reach very steep bending angles in order to fracture ( high N and (cid:98) ∆ ) . In the case where chain ends are unconstrained , cal - culating the fracture rate requires an estimation of the rate of chain end dynamics compared to the dynamics in the junction coordinate . The dimensionless parameter describing these relative rates is k R / D ( 0 ) ρ = 32 (cid:98) ∆ 3 . For chain heterogeneity to enhance thermal fracture , this ratio of rates must be small ( ie : the sampling of junction angles must be substantially faster than the end - to - end motion ) . However , when ∆ becomes small for a chain of constant length , the junction stiﬀness κ must increase and the fracture process becomes dominated by junction energetics rather than deformation of larger por - tions of the chain . In this limit the fracture rate becomes similar for heterogeneous and homogeneously stiﬀ chains ( Fig . 3c , 4a ) . If the end - to - end dynamics are slowed down 5 Figure 3 . Chain heterogeneity enhances junction fracture rates when chain end dynamics are slow .

Dimensionless MFPT is shown as a function of heterogeneity h for ( b ) chains with a ﬁxed junction length (cid:98) ∆ = 0 . 1 and varying stiﬀness and ( c ) chains with a ﬁxed stiﬀness ( N = 0 . 25 ) but varying junction length . Chains are assumed to start from an equilibrium distribution . by increasing the chain length L while keeping the junc - tion length ∆ constant ( Fig . 4b ) , then the stiﬀ side of the chain becomes more ﬂexible and the fracture enhance - ment from chain heterogeneity decreases . Overall , the enhancement in fracture rates for a heterogeneous chain with free end conditions maxes out at approximately 15 % , for a heterogeneity h = (cid:96) p , 1 / (cid:96) p , 2 = 10 ( Fig . 4 ) . 5 . CONCLUDING REMARKS Our calculations show that ﬁlament heterogeneity can substantially enhance the rate of thermal fracture in the case of restricted end - to - end dynamics of the ﬁlament . A modest enhancement is expected for the case of a chain with freely moving ends . We note that the model de - veloped here diﬀers from previous athermal models for fracture [ 14 , 25 ] which indicated that a heterogeneous chain concentrates stresses at the junction when the chain is forced into a buckled conﬁguration . The enhancement in thermally driven fracture occurs despite the fact that the initial conﬁguration of the chain is allowed to sample from the equilibrium distribution . The contrast between the case of rapid and slow r equilibration ( Fig . 3a ) high - lights the purely dynamic nature of this eﬀect . Fracture enhancement arises from the separation in timescales be - tween ﬂuctuations at the junction versus moving the ends of the entire polymer . The presence of a softer chain region allows a junction to reach steep bending angles without requiring large movements of the chain ends and without paying a large energetic cost for the chain defor - mation . While our model focuses on fracture in a speciﬁc junc - tion region , at the internal end of the stiﬀ chain segment , it provides insight into the behavior of other regions in a heterogeneous chain . In particular , regions on the soft side of the chain will behave similarly to the center of a homogeneously soft chain , and are expected to be slow Figure 4 .

By contrast , regions located in the middle of the stiﬀ side would require moving large segments of stiﬀ chain to assume the requisite bending angle , again leading to slow fracture dynamics . Rapid dynamics become possible speciﬁcally close to the junc - tion between the soft and stiﬀ regions , but where the junction itself is still stiﬀ . The model with restricted chain ends is particularly relevant for the coﬁlin - mediated severing of actin ﬁla - ments within a cytoskeletal network . In such networks cross - links and entanglements can eﬀectively restrict the movement of certain positions along the chain , while al - lowing rapid equilibration of chain positions between the cross - link points . Our results indicate that in such situa - tions introducing mechanical heterogeneity into the actin ﬁlaments by coﬁlin binding should substantially enhance thermal severing rates . It should be noted that , in addition to changing the ﬂexibility of actin ﬁlaments , coﬁlin binding also alters the ﬁlament twist density . Recent experiments have shown that constraining ﬁlaments to prevent torsional equilibration enhances actin ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin [ 24 , 39 , 40 ] . The eﬀect described here centers on sever - ing due to bending ﬂuctuations and may provide a paral - lel , unrelated mechanism for coﬁlin - driven fracture . Both twist - based and bending - based severing are expected to depend on the density and mechanics of cross - links in an actin network . By providing a feedback mechanism between network structure and actin severing dynamics , these physical eﬀects may play an important role in regu - lating the self - assembly , turnover , and mechanoresponse of cytoskeletal structures . In addition to helping unravel the mechanisms of actin severing by coﬁlin , the results presented here are gener - ally applicable to the fracture of any semiﬂexible ther - mally ﬂuctuating polymer . Enhanced rates of thermally - activated fracture in mechanically heterogeneous chains point towards general principles for controlling the sta - bility of nanoscale systems , including polymer networks , nanotubules , and molecular threads , for a broad range of biological and industrial applications .

APPENDIX A . ANGULAR DYNAMICS FOR COUPLED RIGID LINKS In this section we derive the angular dynamics for two connected rigid links , each of length (cid:96) , in a highly vis - cous ﬂuid . We assume each of the links has a friction coeﬃcient per unit length µ , and that there is a bending modulus κ for the junction between the links . This sim - pliﬁed system serves as a basis for deriving the appropri - ate dynamics of the junction angle for the heterogeneous worm - like chain . We deﬁne a given conﬁguration of the system by the center of mass positions for the two rigid rods ( (cid:126)r 1 , (cid:126)r 2 ) and their normalized orientations ( (cid:126)u 1 , (cid:126)u 2 ) . The overall energy for this conﬁguration is then given by , E = κ ( 1 − (cid:126)u 1 · (cid:126)u 2 ) + (cid:126)λ · (cid:18) (cid:126)r 1 + (cid:96) 2 u 1 − (cid:126)r 2 + (cid:96) 2 (cid:126)u 2 (cid:19) . ( S1 ) Here , the ﬁrst term corresponds to the bending energy of the junction between the two rods and the second term uses a Lagrange multiplier ( (cid:126)λ ) to enforce the connectivity of the two inextensible rods at the junction . In the freely draining approximation , and in the ab - sence of Brownian forces , the overdamped dynamics of such a system are deﬁned by the equations , ζ r (cid:126)ω i = − (cid:126)u i × ∂E ∂u i ζ t d(cid:126)r i dt = − ∂E ∂(cid:126)r i , ( S2 ) where (cid:126)ω i gives the rotational velocity for each rod ( i = 1 , 2 ) . Here , ζ r = µ(cid:96) 3 / 12 is the rotational frictional coef - ﬁcient of each rod around its center of mass and ζ t = µ(cid:96) the translational friction coeﬃcient [ 41 ] . The Lagrange multiplier (cid:126)λ can be obtained from the constraints : d dt (cid:18) (cid:126)r 1 + (cid:96) 2 u 1 − (cid:126)r 2 + (cid:96) 2 (cid:126)u 2 (cid:19) · (cid:126)u 1 = 0 d dt (cid:18) (cid:126)r 1 + (cid:96) 2 u 1 − (cid:126)r 2 + (cid:96) 2 (cid:126)u 2 (cid:19) · (cid:126)u 2 = 0 . ( S3 ) Solving these equations yields (cid:126)λ · (cid:126)u i = 6 κ ( 1 − ρ 2 ) (cid:96) ( 5 − 3 ρ ) , where ρ = (cid:126)u 1 · (cid:126)u 2 . The dynamics of the angular coordinate ρ are then given by , dρ dt = 48 κ ( 1 − ρ 2 ) µ(cid:96) 3 ( 5 − 3 ρ ) . ( S4 ) This expression gives the eﬀective friction coeﬃcient for the coordinate ρ according to dρ dt = − 1 ζ ( ρ ) ∂E bend ∂ρ = − κ ζ ( ρ ) ζ ( ρ ) = µ(cid:96) 3 ( 5 − 3 ρ ) 48 ( 1 − ρ 2 ) 7 For the angular dynamics of a junction in a continuum worm - like chain , changes in the angle require dragging along a length of chain that should scale as the junction size ∆ . We select an eﬀective link length (cid:96) = 2∆ for use in Eq . 7 . The prefactor of 2 is obtained from ﬁtting to Brownian dynamics simulations with ﬁxed end - to - end distance ( as shown in Fig . 2a ) . This is the only ﬁtting parameter in the theory and is used for all results shown in subsequent ﬁgures . B . MEAN FIRST PASSAGE TIME ON A 1D LANDSCAPE For one - dimensional systems with spatially varying dif - fusivity D ( x ) and free energy landscape F ( x ) , it has been shown that the Fokker - Planck equation which cor - rectly reproduces the Boltzman distribution in the steady state [ 36 ] is given by , dG ( x , t | x 0 ) dt = ∂ ∂x (cid:20) D ( x ) (cid:18) 1 kT ∂F ∂x G + ∂G ∂x (cid:19)(cid:21) ( S5 ) where G ( x , t | x 0 ) is the Green’s function giving the distri - bution over x at time t for a system that started at posi - tion x 0 . A corresponding backward Kolmogorov equation can be derived for this system [ 34 ] as , dG dt = (cid:20) − D ( x 0 ) kT ∂F ∂x 0 + ∂D ∂x 0 (cid:21) ∂G ∂x 0 + D ( x 0 ) ∂ 2 G ∂x 20 ( S6 ) Assuming the system has an absorbing boundary at a and a reﬂecting boundary at L , the mean ﬁrst pas - sage time is deﬁned based on the probability Q ( t | x 0 ) = (cid:82) L a G ( x , t | x 0 ) dx that the absorbing boundary has not yet been reached . Namely , the MFPT is given by T ( x 0 ) = − (cid:82) ∞ 0 t dQdt . We solve for T ( x 0 ) using Eq . S6 in a man - ner analogous to previous calculations with a constant diﬀusivity [ 33 , 35 ] . Assuming an equilibrated distribution of starting positions , the overall mean ﬁrst passage time is then given by (cid:104) T (cid:105) = 1 (cid:82) L a e − F ( x ) / kT dx × × (cid:34)(cid:90) L a dx (cid:90) x a dy (cid:90) L y dz 1 D ( y ) e ( F ( y ) − F ( z ) − F ( x ) ) / kT (cid:35) ( S7 ) We use numerical integration of Eq . S7 to calculate the mean ﬁrst passage time for each ﬁxed value of r over the energy landscape plotted in Fig . 1 . C . BROWNIAN DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS Brownian dynamics simulations are used to verify our simpliﬁed model for dynamics over a free energy land - scape in the ρ and r coordinates . We deﬁne a discretized version of the heterogeneous worm - like chain model , us - ing the standard bead - rod formalism [ 42 ] , with very stiﬀ stretching modulus for constraining the length of the rods . Our chains consist of n = 20 segments of length d , with bending energy E bend = n − 1 (cid:88) i = 1 κ i [ 1 − cos ( ρ i ) ] ( S8 ) for ρ i = cos θ i and θ i the angle between orientations of each consecutive pair of segments . The prefactor is set to κ i = (cid:96) p , 1 d for i ≤ 10 and κ i = (cid:96) p , 2 d otherwise . The central bead represents a junction of size ∆ = d . Chains are initiated in a thermally equilibrated con - ﬁguration by direct sampling of the segment angles . A standard Brownian dynamics algorithm [ 43 ] with 4th - order Runge - Kutta time integration [ 44 ] is used to prop - agate the system forward in timesteps of δt = 10 − 4 d 2 µ b k B T , where the µ B is the friction coeﬃcient of each bead . Sim - ulations are run until either the central chain angle ρ 10 or the end - to - end distance reaches a cutoﬀ value , up to a maximum of 10 7 timesteps . Mean ﬁrst passage times to cutoﬀ cannot be obtained by direct averaging since many chains to not reach the cutoﬀ over the simulation time . Instead , we ﬁt the em - pirical cumulative distribution function for ﬁrst passage times to the functional form 1 − exp ( − t / τ ) , to extract the appropriate time - scale for ﬁrst passage . 10 4 chains are simulated for each data point plotted in Fig . 2 .
