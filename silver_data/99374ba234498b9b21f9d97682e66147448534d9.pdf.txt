Tsai and J . M . Gilbert contributed equally to this work Polyoma virus ( Py ) and simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) travel from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticu - lum ( ER ) from where they enter the cytosol and then the nucleus to initiate infection . Here we demonstrate that speciﬁc gangliosides can serve as plasma mem - brane receptors for these viruses , GD1a and GT1b for Py and GM1 for SV40 . Binding and ﬂotation assays were used to show that addition of these gangliosides to phospholipid vesicles allowed speciﬁc binding of the respective viruses . The crystal structure of polyoma VP1 with a sialic acid - containing oligosaccharide was used to derive a model of how the two terminal sugars ( sialic acid - a 2 , 3 - galactose ) in one branch of GD1a and GT1b are recognized by the virus . A rat cell line deﬁ - cient in ganglioside synthesis is poorly infectible by polyoma and SV40 , but addition of the appropriate gangliosides greatly facilitates virus uptake , transport to the ER and infection . Lipid binding sites for poly - oma are shown to be present in rough ER membranes , suggesting that the virus travel with the ganglioside ( s ) from the plasma membranes to the ER . Keywords : endoplasmic reticulum / gangliosides / glycolipids / polyoma virus / SV40 Introduction Viruses must deliver their nucleic acid across a cellular membrane into the cytoplasm or nucleus of their target cells to cause infection . The strategy employed by enveloped viruses is relatively simple : the viral membrane fuses either with the plasma membrane or with some intracellular membrane . For example , inﬂuenza virus is ﬁrst taken up by endocytosis and then fuses with the endosomal membrane , delivering the nucleocapsid into the cytosol ( reviewed by Poranen et al . , 2002 ) . How non - enveloped DNA viruses , particularly those of the polyoma group , enter the cell , cross a membrane barrier and deliver their DNA to the nucleus is not well understood . Some viruses of this group are taken up in small micropino - cytotic vesicles and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . For example , simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) enters via caveolae , resides initially in caveosomes , a novel organelle enriched in caveolin , and is then trans - ported to the ER ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1989 ; Anderson et al . , 1996 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ; Norkin et al . , 2002 ) . Transport into the ER is essential , as suggested by the fact that infection can be blocked by treatment of the cells with brefeldin A ( Richards et al . , 2002 ) . The related murine polyoma virus ( Py ) is also transported to the ER , where it co - localizes with the luminal protein BiP ( Mannova and Forstova , 2003 ) . Although it is not clear how or why these viruses trafﬁc to the ER , or how they would subsequently cross the ER membrane , the overall pathway is similar to that of bacterial toxins , which trafﬁc from the plasma membrane to the ER , from where they exit into the cytoplasm ( Hazes and Read , 1997 ) . The major structural protein VP1 of Py and SV40 forms a pentamer , and 72 copies of the pentamer assemble into an icosahedral viral capsid ( Liddington et al . , 1991 ; Stehle et al . , 1994 ) . Buried within this capsid are the minor structural proteins VP2 and VP3 , which overlap in sequence and differ only at their N - terminus . The identi - cal , hydrophobic C - terminus of VP2 or VP3 associates with the VP1 pentamer in a 1 : 5 stoichiometry ( Barouch and Harrison , 1994 ; Chen et al . , 1998 ) . The longer VP2 protein contains a myristic acid at its N - terminus , which is buried inside the viral particle but may become exposed during the transport of the virus across the ER ( Sahli et al . , 1993 ; Chen et al . , 1998 ; Norkin et al . , 2002 ) . VP1 is responsible for attachment to the host cell . SV40 binds to the MHC class I molecule at the plasma membrane ( Breau et al . , 1992 ) , but also to other , unidentiﬁed molecules ( Atwood and Norkin , 1989 ) . Antibodies to MHC class I moderately reduce SV40 infection ( Atwood and Norkin , 1989 ; Stang et al . , 1997 ) , but the MHC molecule is not endocytosed together with the virus ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ) . The receptor for Py is also unknown , but sialic acid is an essential component of it ( Fried et al . , 1981 ; Cahan et al . , 1983 ) . In the crystal structure of Py solved with a carbohydrate ligand the VP1 protein makes contact with sialic acid linked to galactose ( sialic acid - a 2 , 3 - Gal ) ( Stehle et al . , 1994 ) , but it is unclear whether variants of this sugar would also bind . Small changes in VP1 affecting the selectivity and avidity of binding to sialic acids have profound effects on viral pathogenicity ( Cahan et al . , 1983 ; Freund et al . , 1991 ; Stehle and Harrison , 1996 , 1997 ; Bauer et al . , 1999 ) . Efforts to identify a unique receptor by screening for monoclonal antibodies that protect cells from infection have been unsuccessful ( Bauer et al . , 1999 ) . However , Gangliosides are receptors for murine polyoma virus and SV40 The EMBO Journal Vol . 22 No . 17 pp . 4346 – 4355 , 2003 4346 ª European Molecular Biology Organization antibody to a 4 b 1 integrin has recently been shown to partially block infection , and a possible role of this integrin as a post - attachment receptor has been suggested ( Caruso et al . , 2003 ) . Here , we report on the identiﬁcation of gangliosides as functional receptors for Py and SV40 . We demonstrate that speciﬁc gangliosides mediate virus attachment , and lead to entry into the ER and expression of nuclear T antigen . This viral uptake pathway bears some similarity to that of toxins , which also use gangliosides as carriers from the plasma membrane to the ER . Results Py binds to a protease - resistant receptor at the plasma membrane To identify the plasma membrane receptor for Py , we puriﬁed total membranes from human erythrocytes . As red cells lack internal organelles , this preparation consists essentially of plasma membranes . The membranes were incubated with puriﬁed Py ( small plaque RA strain ) and then ﬂoated in a discontinuous sucrose gradient . After fractionation , the samples were separated by SDS – PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the Py VP1 protein ( Figure 1A ) . Whereas in the absence of plasma membranes the virus was found in the bottom fractions ( Figure 1A , ﬁrst panel ) , in the presence of membranes most of it ﬂoated into the middle of the gradient ( second panel ) . Thus , there appear to be binding sites for the virus at the plasma membrane . The fact that the virus was found in different fractions of the gradient is probably explained by the heterogeneity of the vesicle population . Extensive treatment of the plasma membranes with proteinase K did not reduce binding ( Figure 1A , third panel ) ; the virus ﬂoated with lighter membranes , con - sistent with their buoyant density being lowered by proteolysis . The conditions of protease treatment resulted in the disappearance of all Coomassie - stainable bands ( right panel ) , suggesting that the virus binds to a non - protein receptor in the plasma membrane . Pre - incubation of the membranes with a 2 - 3 neuraminidase abolished the binding activity ( Figure 1B ) , in agreement with the fact that a similar treatment of cells blocks infection by Py ( Helgeland , 1966 ) . Binding appears to be speciﬁc , since no interaction was seen with either total yeast or bacterial membranes ( Figure 1C , compare ﬁrst panel with second and third panels ) . The Py receptor is a ganglioside We found that an extract containing total lipids had some binding activity , but that much of the activity was lost during the extraction procedure ( data not shown ) . We therefore suspected that the receptor is a relatively hydrophilic lipid molecule . In agreement with this assumption , vesicles containing all four classes of major phospholipids ( phosphatidyl - choline , - ethanolamine , - serine and - inositol ) did not bind the virus ( Figure 2A and B ) . Given that Py receptor ( s ) are known to contains sialic acid , we tested the effects of adding speciﬁc gangliosides . Gangliosides are glycolipids that contain a hydrophobic ceramide lipid and a hydrophilic carbo - hydrate moiety of different structure ( see Figure 2C ) . Small amounts of different gangliosides were added to a phospholipid mixture , which was then dried and resus - Fig . 1 . Py binds to a protease - resistant receptor at the plasma membrane . ( A ) Puriﬁed Py ( strain RA ) was incubated in the absence of membranes or with plasma membranes pre - treated with or without proteinase K . The samples were ﬂoated in a discontinuous sucrose gradient . Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed by SDS – PAGE and immunoblotting with a Py VP1 antibody ( left panels ) . The proteins in the non - proteolyzed and proteolyzed plasma membranes were analyzed by SDS – PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie blue ( right panel ) . ( B ) Puriﬁed Py ( strain RA ) was incubated in the absence of membranes or with plasma membranes pre - treated with or without a 2 , 3 - neuraminidase ( NA ) . The analysis was performed as in ( A ) . ( C ) Puriﬁed Py was incubated alone , or with yeast or bacterial membranes . The analysis was performed as in ( A ) . Polyoma and SV40 use gangliosides as receptors 4347 pended in buffer to form vesicles . The small plaque strain RA was added and the vesicles were ﬂoated in a sucrose gradient . After fractionation , the samples were analyzed for the presence of VP1 . Flotation of Py particles was only seen with gangliosides GD1a or GT1b ( Figure 2A , arrows ) . Similar results were obtained with the more tumorigenic large plaque PTA strain ( Figure 2B , arrows ) . We conclude that GD1a and GT1b gangliosides can function as receptors for both Py strains . The two active gangliosides differ only by a sialic acid residue , which is present in GT1b in the right branch of the sugar ( residue 4R ; Figure 2C ) but absent in GD1a . Features in the gangliosides recognized by Py VP1 The crystal structure of Py VP1 in complex with a sialylated oligosaccharide is known at high resolution ( Stehle and Harrison , 1997 ) . The oligosaccharide used for complex formation contained a sialic acid - a 2 , 3 - Gal - b 1 , 3 - GlcNAc branch , and interactions were seen between VP1 and the sialic acid - a 2 , 3 - Gal moiety only . Comparison B . Tsai et al . 4348 between the binding and non - binding gangliosides sug - gests that the sialic acid - a 2 , 3 - Gal moieties in the left branches of GD1a and GT1b ( residues 5L and 4L ; Figure 2C ) , which are unique to these two gangliosides , must correspond to the sialic acid - a 2 , 3 - Gal moiety recognized by the virus . While all gangliosides contain a second sialic acid - a 2 , 3 - Gal moiety ( residues 3R and 2 ) , its proximity to the membrane likely rules out an interaction with VP1 due to steric constraints . This sialic acid - galactose moiety is very close to the lipid , and inspection of the VP1 structure shows that this steric constraint would likely prevent access to the binding pocket of VP1 ( not shown ) . Moreover , in all but GM3 , the galactose has a branch on the O4 oxygen , and the structure of the complex clearly shows that additional sugars linked to O4 can not be tolerated by VP1 ( Stehle , 1994 ) . Modeling of interactions of GD1a and GT1b with VP1 Based on the unique structural features of GD1a and GT1b , we used the crystal structure of the VP1 - oligosaccharide complex to derive a model for how GD1a would bind to VP1 ( Figure 2D ) . This model shows that the sialic acid - a 2 , 3 - Gal moiety of the left branch of GD1a ( residues 5L and 4L ; Figure 2C ) can interact with VP1 exactly as seen in the structures of several complexes ( Stehle et al . , 1994 ; Stehle and Harrison , 1996 , 1997 ) . The third carbohydrate , GalNAc ( residue 3L ) , can be substituted for the close homolog GlcNAc used in the VP1 complex , without producing any unfavorable contacts . This is not surprising , as the GlcNAc moiety does not contact VP1 in the crystal structure . In its most likely conformation , the remainder of the ganglioside faces away from VP1 , with the second sialic acid ( residue 3R ) and the ‘stem’ ( residues 1 and 2 ) pointing in opposite directions . The second sialic acid is therefore highly unlikely to engage in contacts with VP1 . This explains why the GT1b ganglioside , which has an additional sialic acid attached ( residue 4R ) , also binds VP1 , and it suggests that different Py strains bind equally well to both GD1a and GT1b . In the structure of the RA strain there is a binding pocket adjacent to the ganglioside binding site , which is blocked in the strain PTA ( the latter contains a Glu instead of a Gly at position 91 of the VP1 protein ; Fig . 2 . The Py receptor is a ganglioside . ( A ) Py ( RA strain ) was incubated in the absence of membranes or with liposomes containing different gangliosides . The samples were ﬂoated in a discontinuous sucrose gradient and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the polyoma VP1 protein ( see Figure 1A ) . ( B ) As in ( A ) except that the more tumorigenic Py PTA strain was used . ( C ) Structures of the various ganglio - sides used in ( A ) and ( B ) . ( D ) Modeling of interactions between GD1a and polyoma VP1 coat protein . Two orthogonal views are shown . The back - bone structure of VP1 is shown as a gray ribbon , with residues involved in carbohydrate contacts shown in ball - and - stick representation ( orange for residues with polar interactions , magenta for residues with hydrophobic contacts ) . VP1 was crystallized with a branched disialylated oligosaccharide ( yellow and white ) ( Stehle and Harrison , 1997 ) . The yellow portion of this oligosaccharide is identical to the longer branch of GD1a ( except GlcNAc , which does not contact VP1 , is replaced with GalNAc in GD1a ) , and thus we expect that this portion of GD1a will engage VP1 in the same manner . The remaining three carbohydrate residues of GD1a are attached to the O4 position of GalNAc , and in their most likely conformation they face away from VP1 and are unlikely to engage in contacts ( light blue ) . The second sialic acid binding site of VP1 that accomodates the branched sialic acid ( white ) is probably not occupied by GD1a , and we therefore expect GD1a to bind equally well to RA and PTA Py strains . Polyoma and SV40 use gangliosides as receptors 4349 Freund et al . , 1991 ) . Modeling shows that this additional binding pocket in the RA strain is unlikely to be involved in the interaction with gangliosides ( Figure 2D ) . It may , however , contribute to the binding of glycoproteins ( see below ) . Binding of Py to ganglioside GD1a is required for efﬁcient infection To test whether Py requires gangliosides to infect cells , we used a rat cell line ( C6 glioma ) that is deﬁcient in ganglioside synthesis . C6 cells make detectible levels of GM3 but little or none of the more complex gangliosides such as GM1 or GD1a ( Sottocornola et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 2C ) . However , the missing gangliosides can be added to the cells simply by incubating them with glycolipid micelles ( Moss et al . , 1976 ) . Rat cells in general are non - permissive for Py and SV40 , but can be non - productively infected by each of these viruses . Such infection can readily be monitored by immunostaining of cells with antibodies to the large T antigen using standard ﬂuorescence microscopy . When untreated C6 cells were infected with Py at a high multiplicity of infection ( m . o . i . ) ( > 100 p . f . u . / cell ) , roughly 12 % of the cells ( 64 / 536 ) became infected ( normalized to 100 % in Figure 3A ) . Similarly , when cells were pre - incubated with puriﬁed GM1 ganglioside for 24 h , washed and then challenged with virus , little infection was observed . However , when the cells were pre - incubated with puriﬁed GD1a , the simpler of the two active gangliosides , the number of infected cells increased drastically ( 242 / 516 ) . In repeated experiments , the increase in infection with added GD1a varied between 4 - fold , shown here , to 15 - fold . This increase was largely prevented when GD1a was present during the incubation with the virus ( Figure 3A , ‘ + soluble GD1a’ ) . Successful infection with added GD1a and not GM1 was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting for large T ( Figure 3B ) . These results show that binding of Py to ganglioside GD1a ( or the similar GT1b ) is required for efﬁcient infection of these cells . Transport of Py to the ER by ganglioside GD1a To test whether ganglioside GD1a is required for the transport of Py to the ER , we pre - treated C6 glioma cells with different gangliosides , infected them with virus labeled with a ﬂuorescent dye , and examined the local - ization of the virus by deconvolution ﬂuorescence microscopy . Arrival of the virus in the ER was monitored by its co - localization with the ER luminal protein BiP ( Figure 4A : the red color shows the virus , the green color BiP and the yellow color co - localization ) . Little co - localization was observed in the absence of added ganglioside or upon addition of ganglioside GM1 ( left and middle panel ) . However , upon addition of ganglioside GD1a , signiﬁcant co - localization was seen ( right panel ; about 17 – 20 % of the virus co - localized with BiP after a 4 h incubation ) . To further test whether gangliosides might function as carriers for virus and to conﬁrm that lipid binding sites for the virus are present in the ER , rough ER membranes were puriﬁed from rat liver and solubilized in detergent , and the detergent was then removed to generate proteoliposomes . The latter contain only membrane proteins and lipids , but no peripheral or luminal proteins . When Py was incubated with the ER proteoliposomes , most of the virus ﬂoated with the membranes in a sucrose gradient ( Figure 4B ) , similar to the results found with plasma membranes ( Figure 1A ) or phospholipid micelles containing GD1a or GT1b ( Figure 2A and B ) . When the ER proteoliposomes were incubated with a high concentration of proteinase K , resulting in almost complete disappearance of all Coomassie - stainable material ( Figure 4B , right panel ) , the proteolyzed membranes bound the virus with un - reduced efﬁciency ( Figure 4B , left bottom panel ) . On the other hand , treatment of the ER proteoliposomes with a 2 , 3 - neuraminidase abolished binding activity ( Figure 4C ) , consistent with an interaction with a sialic acid - containing ganglioside . Some binding activity could be recovered after lipid extraction ( data not shown ) . Lipid binding sites for the virus are therefore present in the ER of uninfected cells , consistent with a possible transport pathway involving gangliosides from plasma membranes to ER in normal cells . To rule out the possibility that binding was to contaminating membranes rather than ER , we examined whether the virus - interacting membranes contain bound ribosomes , a characteristic of rough ER membranes . For these experiments we used microsomes , because pre - liminary experiments showed that they bind Py with about the same efﬁciency as proteoliposomes . Presumably , a Fig . 3 . Binding of Py to ganglioside GD1a is required for infection . ( A ) Quantiﬁcation of Py LTAg expression . C6 glioma cells lacking gangliosides more complex than GM3 ( see Figure 2C ) were incubated with or without gangliosides GM1 or GD1a as indicated . The cells were washed and incubated with Py ( RA strain ) in the absence or pres - ence of GD1a . Expression of Py LTAg was monitored after immuno - staining in a ﬂuorescence microscope . The data are presented as the percentage of total nuclei ( duplicates of about 500 nuclei ) that were Py LTAg positive , normalized to 100 % . ( B ) As in ( A ) except expression of Py LTAg in C6 cells was analyzed by SDS – PAGE followed by immunoblotting with Py LTAg antibodies . B . Tsai et al . 4350 certain fraction of the vesicles is not fully sealed , allowing the virus to bind to the luminal side of the membrane presumed to contain gangliosides . The membranes were treated with puromycin and high salt to strip off bound ribosomes before addition of the virus . In the subsequent ﬂotation , the virus fractionated with the ribosome - stripped membranes at a lower density than seen with the original membranes ( Figure 4D , second versus third panels ) . A similar shift in density was observed with the ER membrane protein ribophorin I ( fourth versus ﬁfth panel ) . Thus , the virus is able to bind to rough ER membranes . Together , these results show that ganglio - sides , which receive their sugar moiety in the Golgi , must be able to go back to the ER . Fig . 4 . Transport of Py to the ER by ganglioside GD1a . ( A ) C6 glioma cells lacking gangliosides more complex than GM3 ( see Figure 2C ) were incu - bated with GM1 or GD1a and then infected with Texas Red - labeled Py ( RA strain ) . After 4 h the cells were ﬁxed and immunostained for the ER lumi - nal protein BiP using Oregon Green - labeled secondary antibodies ( green ) . Nuclei were labeled with DAPI . Yellow points ( white arrow head ) indicate co - localization . ( B ) Puriﬁed Py ( strain RA ) was incubated in the absence or presence of ER proteoliposomes pre - treated or not with proteinase K . The samples were ﬂoated in a sucrose gradient and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the Py VP1 protein ( left panels ) . The proteins in the non - proteolyzed or proteolyzed membranes were analyzed by SDS – PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie blue ( right panel ) . ( C ) Puriﬁed Py ( strain RA ) was incubated in the absence or presence of ER proteoliposomes pre - treated or not with a 2 , 3 - neuraminidase ( NA ) . The samples were analyzed as in ( A ) . ( D ) Puriﬁed Py ( strain RA ) was incubated in the presence or absence of rough ER membranes or ribosome - stripped ER membranes . The samples were analyzed as in ( A ) . An antibody against ribophorin I was used to monitor ER membranes in the fractions . Polyoma and SV40 use gangliosides as receptors 4351 SV40 binds to ganglioside GM1 to infect cells SV40 is structurally related to Py ( Liddington et al . , 1991 ) and also travels to the ER ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1989 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ; Norkin et al . , 2002 ) . To determine whether it also binds to a ganglioside , phospholipid vesicles were spiked with small amounts of different gangliosides and their interaction with SV40 was tested by ﬂotation of the membranes in a sucrose gradient and immunoblotting for VP1 . Binding of SV40 was only seen with the ganglioside GM1 ( Figure 5A , arrow ) . To test whether GM1 is required for SV40 infection of cells , we infected C6 cells that were either untreated or pre - incubated with GM1 , and the infection was monitored by immunostaining for SV40 large T antigen ( Figure 5B ) . Few cells expressing SV40 large T were observed when the incubation was performed without ganglioside or with ganglioside GD1a ( ~ 4 out of 500 cells ) . However , upon addition of GM1 a substantial increase in the number of infected cells was observed ( 19 out of 522 cells ) . This increase was not apparent if GM1 was present in the medium during the incubation with the virus . Immunoblotting for SV40 large T conﬁrmed the speciﬁ - city of GM1 in mediating infection ( Figure 5C ) . We conclude that ganglioside GM1 can serve as a functional receptor for SV40 . Discussion Our results show that the gangliosides GD1a / GT1b and GM1 serve as receptors for Py and SV40 , respectively . The two viruses recognize the carbohydrate moieties of the glycolipids . Molecular modeling shows that in the case of Py , the known sialic acid - binding pocket of VP1 accom - modates the two terminal sugar residues in the left branch of GD1a and GT1b ( see Figure 2C ) . The binding of Py and SV40 to speciﬁc gangliosides promotes transport to the ER and infection of cells . Lipid binding sites for Py were also found in ER membranes , suggesting the possibility that the virus may travel on gangliosides from the plasma membrane into the ER . As expected from the similar structures of the Py and SV40 VP1 proteins , the ganglioside receptors are also structurally related . The critical sialic acid - a 2 , 3 - Gal moiety of the Py receptors GD1a / GT1b ( residues 5L and 4L ; Figure 2C ) is also present on the short arm of GM1 ( residues 3R and 2 ) , but too close to the ceramide to bind Py . In GM1 , it is presumedly the disaccharide lacking sialic acid ( residues 4L and 3L ) that binds SV40 . This is consistent with previous observations that infection of cells by Py , in contrast to SV40 , can be prevented by treatment with neuraminidase ( Helgeland , 1966 ) . It is also consistent with results from the structural comparison of Py and SV40 ( Stehle and Harrison , 1996 ) . While the binding pockets of both viruses are quite similar , SV40 VP1 lacks the speciﬁc residues corresponding to those that contact sialic acid in Py , and therefore it would not be expected to bind sialic acid in the same manner as Py . On the other hand , the general similarity of the Py and SV40 VP1 structures , and especially the presence of equally spaced pockets on the VP1 surfaces , indicates that both bind carbohydrates . The GD1b ganglioside retains all of the features of GM1 but has an extra sialic acid attached to its right branch ( residue 4R ) . Our observation that GM1 Fig . 5 . SV40 binds to ganglioside GM1 to infect cells . ( A ) SV40 was incubated in the absence or presence of liposomes containing different gangliosides , as indicated . The samples were ﬂoated in a sucrose gradient and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against Py VP1 , VP2 and VP3 proteins . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of SV40 LTAg expression . C6 glioma cells lacking gangliosides more complex than GM3 ( see Figure 2C ) were incubated with or without gangliosides GM1 or GD1a , as indicated . The cells were washed and incubated with SV40 in the absence or presence of GM1 . Expression of SV40 LTAg was monitored after immunostaining in a ﬂuorescence microscope . The data are presented as the percentage of total nuclei ( duplicates of about 500 nuclei ) that were SV40 LTAg positive , normalized to 100 % . ( C ) As in ( B ) except expression of SV40 LTAg in C6 cells was analyzed by SDS – PAGE followed by immuno - blotting with SV40 LTAg antibodies . B . Tsai et al . 4352 binds SV40 , whereas GD1b does not , suggests that this second sialic acid may interfere sterically with binding . This would imply that the Gal - b 1 , 3 - GalNac moiety binds to SV40 in a conformation that brings the ﬁrst sialic acid in close proximity to the virus , and does not tolerate the presence of an additional sialic acid attached to it . The identiﬁcation of glycolipids as receptors for Py and SV40 suggests obvious similarities with bacterial toxins , such as cholera toxin , Shiga toxin and ricin ( for a more complete list , see Table I ) . These toxins are transported from the plasma membrane back to the ER , where they cross the membrane into the cytosol and induce cyto - toxicity by various mechanisms . For most , and perhaps all , toxins of this class , glycolipids appear to be the receptor on the plasma membrane . The best studied case is cholera toxin . Each of its B subunits in a pentameric ring binds to the ganglioside GM1 . Association of GM1 with lipid rafts is required for retrograde transport of cholera toxin via the Golgi to the ER ( Wolf et al . , 2002 ; Y . Fujinaga , A . A . Wolf , C . Rodighiero , H . Wheeler , B . Tsai , L . Allen , J . Jobling , T . A . Rapoport , R . K . Holmes and W . I . Lencer , submitted ) . The holotoxin is disassembled by protein disulﬁde isomerase in the ER , and the toxic A1 fragment of the A subunit is subsequently transported across the ER mem - brane ( Tsai et al . , 2001 ) . The structurally related toxin LTIIb binds to and travels on ganglioside GD1a ( van den Akker et al . , 1996 ) . Forward transport of glycolipids has long been established : the ceramide moiety is synthesized in the ER and the carbohydrate chain in the Golgi , and the mature molecules then travel on to the plasma membrane ( Kolter et al . , 2002 ) . Our data now suggest that a fraction of the glycolipids can go backwards and serve as carrier for viruses and toxins . Viruses , however , unlike the toxins , may bypass the Golgi , and follow an alternate route to the ER , as suggested for SV40 ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . To date , no co - localization of Py with Golgi markers has been seen in GD1a - supplemented C6 cells . The identiﬁcation of GD1a / GT1b as receptors for Py , together with the known crystal structure , indicates that there is surprisingly little speciﬁcity in the interaction ; the VP1 protein recognizes only the sialic acid - galactose terminal sugars . This structure is also present on glycoproteins . For example , N - glycosylated proteins with a complex type of sugar contain the terminal sialic acid - galactose - GlcNAc chain , which differs from that in ganglioside GD1a only by the third sugar ( GalNAc ) . Similarly , O - linked sugars on glycoproteins can have the sialic acid - galactose - GalNAc chain that is found on gangliosides . Thus , one would expect Py to bind to these glycoproteins as well . Indeed , we have observed strong binding of Py to rat C6 cells lacking GD1a / GT1b ( data not shown ) . The previously observed binding of SV40 to MHC class I molecules ( Breau et al . , 1992 ) could also be explained by interaction with an attached sugar chain , although one would expect other glycoproteins to bind as well . Interaction of the viruses with glycoproteins does not lead to efﬁcient infection of rat C6 cells . However , the low level of infection in these cells lacking gangliosides could be mediated by glycoproteins . In mouse cells , it is possible that glycoprotein receptors may play a more prominent role as Py receptors . a 4 b 1 integrin for example has been implicated as a receptor in mouse cells ( Caruso et al . , 2003 ) . Infection of mouse cells by Py can be inhibited by tunicamycin ( Chen and Benjamin , 1997 ) . However , as an inhibitor of N - glycosyl - ation , tunicamycin may act upstream of both glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis . This is because many glycosyl - transferases , including some sialyltransferases , are them - selves N - glycosylated and are known to fold and function poorly in the absence of glycosylation ( J . Paulson , personal communication ) . Since Py can bind to different glyco - proteins carrying the appropriate carbohydrate chain , many of these proteins may bind the virus or even internalize it without causing infection . This may con - tribute to the known low efﬁciency of infection . It is also conceivable that glycoproteins serve as primary receptors from which the virus is transferred to the gangliosides , although there is no apparent driving force at the plasma membrane for the directed transfer of the virus from one receptor to the other , and no reason why the virus could not bind directly to the ganglioside . In addition , electron microscopic studies of SV40 and Py infection shows that the viral membrane is in extremely close apposition with the cellular membrane , both for virus at the surface and inside the cell ( Mackay and Consigli , 1976 ; Maul et al . , 1978 ; Stang et al . , 1997 ) , as would be expected from a high avidity binding to glycolipid receptor molecules that extend only a short distance from the plane of the lipid bilayer . The existence of proteinaceous ‘decoys’ or pseudo - receptors in the mouse may also explain the observed differences in the infectivity of Py strains ( Bauer et al . , 1999 ) . The crystal structure shows that strain RA , in contrast to PTA , has a secondary binding pocket , which can accommodate a sialic acid residue that branches off from a GlcNAc or GalNAc at the third terminal position ( Stehle et al . , 1994 ; Stehle and Harrison , 1997 ) . This type of branch occurs in O - glycosylated proteins , such as glycophorin A ( Cahan et al . , 1983 ) . The binding of the RA strain to these glycoproteins may explain why it is less infectious in the mouse than the non - binding PTA strain ( Dubensky et al . , 1991 ; Freund et al . , 1991 ) . The RA virus may be diverted to a non - productive pathway and prevented from spreading efﬁciently in the mouse . Py has an extremely broad host range in terms of the number of different cell types it infects in its natural host ( Dawe et al . , 1987 ) . SV40 likewise can infect a variety of different cell types . Whether these viruses indeed utilize Table I .

Non - envelope viruses Py GD1a / GT1b SV40 GM1 Polyoma and SV40 use gangliosides as receptors 4353 both glycoproteins and glycolipids as functional receptors in the intact host , or whether in a given cell type they rely uniquely on one or the other class , and how they might trafﬁc differently depending on the receptor , are important issues that remain for further study . Materials and methods Materials Puriﬁed gangliosides were purchased from Matreya , puriﬁed phosphat - idyl - choline , - ethanolamine , - serine and - inositol from Avanti , proteinase K – agarose beads and 4 ¢ , 6 ¢ - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) from Sigma , a 2 , 3 - neuraminidase , puromycin , antibodies against BiP and SV40 large T antigen from Calbiochem , C6 glioma cell line from ATCC , Oregon Green anti - rabbit antibodies from Molecular Probes , and rhodamine - labeled goat anti - rat antibodies from Jackson Laboratories . Antibodies against the Py VP1 protein , VP1 , - 2 and - 3 proteins and Py large T antigen were generated in the Benjamin laboratory . Antibodies against ribophorin I were generated in the Rapoport laboratory . Puriﬁcation of Py and SV40 Puriﬁcation of Py and SV40 was performed as described by Gilbert et al . ( 2003 ) . Puriﬁed polyoma virus was labelled with the FluoReporter Texas Red protein labeling kit ( Molecular Probes ; Gilbert et al . , 2003 ) . Preparation of membranes Human erythrocytes from Dr B . Tsai ( Harvard Medical School ) were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min . The cells were washed with a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 8 ) , lysed in water , and total membranes collected by centrifugation ( 12 000 g for 10 min ) . The membranes , hereafter referred to as plasma membrane , were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 6 ) , 250 mM sucrose , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM MgOAc 2 . Rough ER membranes were isolated from canine pancreas . The generation of ribosome - stripped ER membranes and ER proteoliposomes were as previously described ( Go¨rlich and Rapoport , 1993 ) . Yeast total membranes were as described previously ( Tsai and Rapoport , 2002 ) , and Escherichia coli membranes were a generous gift from Dr W . Wickner ( Dartmouth Medical School , Dartmouth , NH ) . Sucrose ﬂotation assay Approximately 15 m g of plasma membrane or ER proteoliposomes were incubated with 50 ng of Py for 30 min at 30 (cid:176) C . Eighty microliters of a 73 % sucrose solution was added and mixed thoroughly with the sample and placed at the bottom of a Beckman centrifuge tube ( 7 3 20 mm ) . Fifty microliters of a 45 % sucrose solution was layered over the sample , followed by 50 m l of a 25 % sucrose solution . The sample was centrifuged in a Beckman TLA100 rotor for 1 h at 100 000 r . p . m . Samples ( 20 m l ) were sequentially removed from the top of the gradient and analyzed by SDS – PAGE . For testing Py and SV40 binding to liposomes spiked with various gangliosides , 1 m l of puriﬁed ganglioside ( 1 mM ) was mixed with 19 m l of phosphatidyl - choline ( 10 mg / ml ) , 5 m l of phosphatidyl - ethanolamine ( 10 mg / ml ) , 3 m l of phosphatidyl - inositol ( 10 mg / ml ) and 1 m l of phosphatidyl - serine ( 10 mg / ml ) , all dissolved in chloroform . The mixture was dried under vacuum , and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 6 ) , 250 mM sucrose , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM MgOAc 2 . The resuspended vesicles were sonicated in a water sonicator bath for 30 min at room temperature and incubated at 4 (cid:176) C overnight . For analyzing Py binding , 1 m l of Py ( 50 ng / m l ) was added to 19 m l of ganglioside - containing lipid vesicles . Eighty microliters of a 73 % sucrose solution was then added and mixed thoroughly with the sample and placed at the bottom of a Beckman centrifuge tube ( 7 3 20 mm ) . The sample was processed as above . To analyze SV40 binding , 15 m l of SV40 was added to 25 m l of ganglioside - containing lipid vesicles . Sixty microliters of of a 73 % sucrose solution was then added and mixed thoroughly with the sample and placed at the bottom of a Beckman centrifuge tube ( 7 3 20 mm ) . The sample was processed as above . Proteinase K digestion Plasma membrane and ER proteoliposomes were incubated with 10 m l of proteinase K – agarose beads ( 10 mg / ml ) for 30 min at room temperature . The protease was removed from the membranes by pelleting . The proteolyzed membranes were tested for their ability to bind to the virus as above . Infectivity assay Infection of C6 glioma cells by Py and SV40 was performed as previously described in Gilbert and Benjamin ( 2000 ) . Cells ( 5 3 10 4 ) were plated on 12 mm glass coverslips and let settle for 3 h at 37 (cid:176) C in a CO 2 incubator . Cells were pre - incubated with either media , 3 . 2 m M GM1 or 2 . 7 m M GD1a for 24 h at 37 (cid:176) C . Prior to infection , cells were washed three times with media . Cells were infected at an m . o . i of 500 for Py and 2000 for SV40 . For ganglioside competition experiments , either 3 . 2 m M GM1 or 2 . 7 m M GD1a was added with the virus . Successful entry was assessed by nuclear expression of Py and SV40 large T antigen by standard ﬂuorescence microscopy . Immunoblotting for large T antigen Cells were plated in 24 - well dishes at 5 3 10 4 per well . Cells were pre - incubated with either media , 3 . 2 m M GM1 or 2 . 7 m M GD1a for 24 h at 37 (cid:176) C . Cells were washed three times and infected with m . o . i . of 400 for either Py or SV40 and let incubated for 32 h . Cells were rinsed twice and lysed in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors . Samples were analyzed by SDS – PAGE and immunoblotted with either antibodies against Py LTAg or SV40 LTAg . Immunoﬂuorescence and co - localization assay Co - localization of Py and BiP was performed using deconvolution microscopy , as previously described in Gilbert et al . ( 2003 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were plated at 5 3 10 4 per well on 12 mm glass coverslips . Media was changed at t = 3 h to media alone , a media containing 3 . 2 m M GM1 or 2 . 7 m M GD1a . After 24 h at 37 (cid:176) C in a CO 2 incubator , cells were rinsed three times and placed on ice . Texas Red - labeled Py was added and allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 (cid:176) C . Cells were rinsed twice and new media was added . Cells were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4 h post - infection . Cells were permeabilized in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and then BiP was immunostained with a rabbit anti - BiP antibody . Anti - rabbit antibodies were detected with goat anti - rabbit secondary Oregon Green - labeled antibodies . Cells were washed , mounted in Mowiol and examined using a Nikon Eclipse microscope with an apochromatic Plan 60 3 1 . 4 oil objective equipped with a Delta Vision optical sectioning system employing SoftWoRx software with 0 . 2 - m M thick step Z sections . Modeling of GD1a onto the VP1 protein of Py The existing structure of the sialylated oligosaccharide ( Stehle and Harrison , 1997 ) was modiﬁed as follows . The terminal sialic acid a 2 - 3 Gal moiety was left unaltered . The third sugar , GlcNAc , was replaced with GalNAc . This only involved switching the O4 oxygen from the equatorial to the axial position . The a 2 - 6 - linked sialic acid was deleted . The additional sugars of GD1a were modeled onto the GalNAc residue in conformations that have favorable staggered dihedral angles and do not result in steric clashes . Other conformations are of course possible ; however , none of these conformations would result in contacts of these additional sugars with VP1 residues . Acknowledgements We would like to thank G .
