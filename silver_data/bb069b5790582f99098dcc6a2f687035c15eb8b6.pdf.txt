Among these effectors , SipA facilitates bacterial invasion and promotes intestinal inflammation . The mechanisms by which this effector carries out these functions are incompletely understood although SipA ' s ability to modulate actin dynamics is central to some of these activities . Here we report the cryo - EM structure of SipA bound to filamentous actin . We show that this effector stabilizes actin filaments through unique interactions of its carboxy terminal domain with four actin subunits . Furthermore , our structure - function studies revealed that SipA ' s actin - binding activity is independent from its ability to stimulate intestinal inflammation . Overall , these studies illuminate critical aspects of Salmonella pathogenesis , and provide unique insight into the mechanisms by which a bacterial effector modulates actin dynamics . 3 MAIN Salmonella enterica serovars can cause a range of human illnesses , from self - limiting gastroenteritis ( i . e . food poisoning ) to systemic , life - threatening infections ( i . e . typhoid fever ) , resulting in an estimated 200 , 000 annual death worldwide ( 1 - 8 ) . Central to their pathogenesis is their ability to invade intestinal epithelial cells and cause intestinal inflammation ( 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 ) . Epithelial cell invasion is orchestrated by the combined activity of several effectors of a type III protein secretion system ( T3SS ) encoded within its pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) ( 9 - 12 ) . These effectors trigger cellular responses that result in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton leading to the formation of large lamellipodia - like structures or membrane ruffles that internalize the bacteria into a membrane - bound compartment , the Salmonella - containing vacuole . Three of these effector proteins , SopE , SopE2 , and SopB , play a central role in the internalization process by stimulating Rho - family GTPases , which initiate downstream signaling leading to the WASH / WAVE - dependent activation of endogenous actin nucleators , such as the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 13 - 18 ) . SopE and its close homolog SopE2 directly target the Rho - family GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 acting as potent exchange factors ( 13 , 19 ) . In contrast , SopB activates endogenous cellular exchange factors by fluxing phosphoinositides through its phosphoinositide - phosphatase activity ( 15 ) . Two other effectors , SipC and SipA , contribute to bacterial invasion by directly targeting actin ( 20 , 21 ) . Besides its role in T3SS - mediated protein translocation ( 22 ) , SipC can nucleate and bundle actin filaments ( 21 ) . A SipC mutant defective in actin - binding but proficient in T3SS - mediated protein translocation , showed a relatively small but significant defect in bacterial internalization ( 23 ) , indicating an accessory but important role in bacterial cell entry . SipA plays a complex role in Salmonella pathogenesis . Through its carboxy - terminal actin - binding domain , SipA contributes to bacterial entry by reducing the critical concentration of actin required for its polymerization ( 20 , 24 ) . Furthermore , SipA stabilizes actin filaments and prevents the 4 depolymerizing action of F - actin - severing proteins such as ADF / Cofilin and gelsolin ( 25 ) . Consequently , the absence of SipA results in a reduced size of the bacterial stimulated actin ruffles and decreased epithelial cell invasion ( 20 , 25 ) . In addition , through its amino - terminal domain , SipA modulates the intestinal inflammatory response to Salmonella by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood ( 26 , 27 ) . However , it remains unclear whether the actin - binding activity of SipA is related to this additional function since despite previous efforts ( 28 ) , the lack of high resolution structural information on the SipA - actin interface has hampered the construction of SipA mutants that are essential to sort out this issue . Similarly , due to the lack of structural information , the mechanisms by which SipA modulates actin dynamics are poorly understood . Although the crystal structure of the actin - binding domain of SipA in isolation is available ( 29 ) , its atomic structure bound to F - actin is not . Previous low - resolution negative stained cryo - EM structures led to the proposal that SipA " staples " actin filaments through the deployment of two non - globular arms that reach out to opposing actin strands , presumably engaging actin in a similar manner to nebulin ( 29 , 30 ) . However , the lack of high - resolution structures has prevented the rigorous testing of such a model . Furthermore , machine learning – based approaches such as that afforded by Alpha Fold ( 31 , 32 ) , are inadequate to predict the structure of SipA bound to F - actin . In this study we report the cryo - EM structure of SipA bound to F - actin at 3 . 6 Å resolution . Our structure , validated by functional studies , clarifies the function of SipA , reveals a unique mechanism of F - actin stabilization by an actin - binding protein , and provides unique insight into the mechanisms of Salmonella invasion . Results Overall Structure of SipA decorated F - actin 5 The S . Typhimurium effector protein SipA is 685 amino acids in length and is composed of at least three domains : an N - terminal chaperone - binding domain , a central ~ 200 amino acid domain modeled by Alphafold as long unstructured loops , and a C - terminal actin - binding globular domain ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . We first attempted to purified full - length SipA using different tags and purification conditions . However , consistent with previous reports ( 29 ) , all constructs containing the central region were insoluble . Therefore , to study the actin - stabilizing function of SipA we concentrated our efforts on its C - terminal domain ( amino acids 447 to 685 ) , which previous studies have found to contain all its actin - modulating activities ( 20 , 29 ) . Consistent with previous reports ( 20 , 29 ) , we found that purified SipA 447 - 685 interact with skeletal muscle actin with high affinity ( 0 . 54 µM ) as determined by a co - sedimentation assay ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Also , consistent with previous observations ( 20 ) , negative stained actin filaments polymerized in the presence of SipA observed under the electron microscope showed a thicker and straighter appearance than filaments polymerized in its absence ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . To determine the structure of the SipA - actin complex , purified G - actin was first polymerized to form filaments , then mixed with purified SipA 447 - 685 , and examined by single particle cryo - EM . We collected 4 , 740 movies , of which 2 , 370 were used for manual filament picking ( see Methods ) . In total , 320 , 109 filament segments were boxed out for further analyses . The helical parameters of SipA 447 - 685 - decorated actin filaments were determined by helical indexing of the averaged power spectrum . By applying helical symmetry in the EM reconstruction , we obtained a map with extra densities alongside both strands of the actin filaments , which were not present in actin filaments alone and therefore assumed to correspond to SipA ( Fig . 1 ) . Notably , lower electron map occupancy of these extra densities was observed both in 2D class averages and in initial 3D reconstructions indicating a sub - stoichiometric presence of SipA on the actin filaments ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . DeepEMhancer ( 33 ) was applied to improve the map visibility and connectivity . A final map was produced with a global resolution of 3 . 6 Å determined by the Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) at 0 . 143 cutoff ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . This map showed densities 6 corresponding to the side chains of most actin residues , as well as the bound nucleotide and the associated Mg 2 + in polymerized actin , which allowed the unambiguous subsequent model building of SipA ( see below ) . The density corresponding to SipA 447 - 685 is compact and globular , with dimensions ( 30 Å x 40 Å x 40 Å ) that correspond well with its previously solved crystal structure ( PDB ID : 1Q5Z ) ( 29 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . We also detected the presence of a poorly resolved non - globular extension at the C - terminus that inserts deep into F - actin . However , contrary to what has been previously reported ( 29 ) , we did not observe any non - globular protrusions or arms that reach out to the opposite actin strands even though the same SipA construct was used in both studies . SipA decorates both sides of the actin filaments , following their helical symmetry ( Fig . 1 ) and making contact mainly at the pockets between the two strands of the actin filament ( see below ) . Atomic model of SipA bound to F - actin The atomic model of the SipA - F - actin complex was built by docking onto the EM map the crystal structure of SipA ( PDB ID : 1Q5Z ) ( 29 ) and ADP - Pi - actin ( PDB ID : 6DJN ) ( 34 ) into the reconstructed EM map using Chimera ( 35 ) and several rounds of model building and refinement with COOT ( 36 ) and Phenix ( 37 ) . Residues 514 - 675 of SipA could be resolved in our map consisting of a globular domain that encompasses residues 514 - 657 , and a C - terminal extension that comprises residues 658 - 675 ( Fig . 2A ) . This is in accordance with previous observations indicating that the central domain of SipA , located immediately adjacent to the amino terminal end of its actin - binding domain , is unstructured , which was confirmed by AlphaFold modeling ( 31 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Alignment of the globular domain of SipA bound to actin with its crystal structure in solution revealed that actin - binding does not induce substantial conformational changes [ a Cα root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) over residues 514 - 658 : 0 . 843 Å ] ( Fig . 2B ) . Only minor local conformational changes in SipA were observed at its actin - binding surface . Similarly , only minor local conformational changes were noticeable in the actin filaments bound 7 to SipA mainly involving the D - loop region , with no detectable changes in the bound nucleotide , and the associated Mg 2 + ( Fig . 2C ) . The SipA - associated density in our structure could be fully accounted in the modeled structure since in our cryo - EM map , SipA is seen interacting with actin as a globular structure ( Fig . 2A ) . In addition , we observed a poorly resolved carboxy terminal extension of SipA , which inserts deep into the F - actin filament . We established that , as previously shown ( 29 ) , this extension is required for the ability of SipA to polymerize G - actin although it appears dispensable for its ability to stabilize F - actin ( Supplementary Fig . 6A - D ) . Furthermore , consistent with the functional importance of this extension , its deletion also affected the ability of S . Typhimurium to invade cultured epithelial cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6E ) . Interfaces between SipA and actin filament The interface between the globular domain of SipA and the actin filament is unprecedented in that a single globular domain engages four actin subunits on the same strand ( N + 0 , N + 1 , N + 2 , and N + 3 ) . SipA engages actin through hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds ( Fig . 3 ) . Its interface with the actin N + 0 subunit is relatively small ( ~ 155 . 3 Å 2 ) , and it involves residues in the SD4 domain in actin and residues in helix 4 ( H4 ) and loop 4 ( L4 ) in SipA 447 - 685 ( Fig . 3B and 3C , interface residues are highlighted in cyan ) . The interface between SipA and actin N + 1 is the largest of all burying ~ 746 . 1 Å 2 . This interface is stabilized by more substantial interactions involving residues in the SD1 and SD2 loops of the actin subunit and H1 , L2 , H2 , L3 , H3 , L4 , H4 , and L5 in SipA 447 - 685 ( Fig . 3B and 3C interface residues are highlighted in yellow ) . The interface between SipA and actin # N + 2 is also substantial burying 531 . 6 Å 2 and involving acting residues mostly in the helices of SD3 and SD4 domain , engaging residues in L2 , H1 , L2 , H2 , L7 , and H7 in SipA 446 - 684 ( Fig . 3B and 3C , interface residues are highlighted in orange ) . Finally , the interface between SipA and actin # N + 3 is mainly between the loops of SD1 and SD3 domain in actin and H2 , L3 , H7 and L8 in SipA 446 - 684 ( Fig . 3B and 3C , interface residues are highlighted in green ) and buries ~ 214 . 9 Å 2 . 8 Overall , the combined interface between the globular domain of SipA and F - actin is very substantial thus explaining its rather high affinity for F - actin . Comparison of SipA with other actin binding molecules Because of their affinity for polymerized actin , the fungal toxins phalloidin and jasplakinolide are frequently used for visualizing filamentous actin . SipA targets actin at a similar site to where these fungal toxins bind filamentous actin ( Fig . 4A ) . However , superimposition of the structures of SipA decorated actin with the toxin - actin complexes , revealed that the C - terminal extension domain of SipA would clash with the two toxins , indicating the binding of SipA may block the binding of phalloidin and jasplakinolide ( Fig . 4A and 4B ) . Pyrene labeling has been widely employed to measure the kinetics of actin polymerization and the interaction between actin and actin - binding proteins including SipA ( 20 , 29 ) . In this context , it is of interest that SipA binds actin at a site very close to the pyrene - binding site ( 38 ) and that our structure shows that the binding of SipA alters the confirmation of the D - loop region in a manner that would interferes pyrene binding . More specifically , SipA binding to filamentous actin results in a conformational change in a tyrosine residue ( Y143 ) located within the pyrene - binding site that is predicted to result in clashes with pyrene potentially interfering with its binding ( Fig . 4C ) . Therefore , these observations suggest that SipA may affect actin polymerization assays that rely on pyrene - actin . The SipA actin - binding site also overlaps with the binding site of other well characterized actin - regulatory proteins ( Fig . 4 ) . For example , SipA binds the same groove in F - actin that serves as a binding site for the muscle protein nebulin ( Fig . 4D ) ( 39 ) ( 40 ) . Based on low resolution structures of SipA and Nebulin bound to actin , it was previously proposed that SipA mimics nebulin in its mechanism of actin - binding ( 30 ) . Our structure is consistent with this notion since several actin residues engaged by SipA ( e . g . K68 , E117 , E224 , E276 , and R372 ) are also engaged by nebulin ( 41 ) . 9 The Arp2 / 3 complex are responsible for the formation of branches on actin filaments ( 42 ) . Superimposition of our structure and the previous structure of the actin branch junction ( PDB ID : 8E9B ) ( 43 ) shows that SipA and Arp3 bind at the same site on actin filaments ( Fig . 4E ) . Thus , binding of SipA likely inhibits the binding of Arp2 / 3 complex thus potentially preventing the branching of actin filaments . It was previously reported that SipA interferes with the F - actin severing activity of ADF / cofilin ( 25 ) . Although SipA and Cofilin ( 5YU8 ) ( 44 ) bind actin at different sites , superimposing the two structures showed that Cofilin clashes with the D - loop region and the C - terminal loop ( S348 - F352 ) of actin in the SipA - decorated filament ( Fig . 4F ) . These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for the observation that F - actin filaments bound to SipA are resistant to the severing activity of ADF / cofilin ( 25 ) . Bacterial actin homologs lack structural features that are essential for SipA binding Many bacteria , including Salmonella , encode highly conserved cytoskeletal proteins such as MreB and ParM that are structural homologs of actin ( 45 , 46 ) . However , despite the close structural similarities between mammalian actin and the bacterial counterparts , SipA should have evolved to be unable to target these bacterial actin homologs as such binding would likely be detrimental for bacterial physiology and could potentially trap SipA within the bacterial cytoplasm . Consistent with this notion , comparison of the structures of MreB and ParM with actin shows that several actin structural features that are crucial for the formation of its interface with SipA are partially or totally absent from MreB and ParM ( Fig . 5 ) . These results indicate that , as previously suggested ( 30 ) , the SipA actin - binding sites have evolved to purposedly avoid binding to the bacterial actin homologs . Structure - function analyses of SipA indicate that its actin - modulating and pro - inflammatory activities are independent from one another 10 SipA has been associated with two different phenotypes , bacterial invasion of intestinal epithelial cells through its actin - modulating activity ( 20 ) , and the stimulation of intestinal inflammation through poorly understood mechanisms that involve its amino - terminal half ( 26 , 27 , 47 ) . Whether the ability of SipA to stimulate intestinal inflammation requires its actin modulating activity is unclear since the lack of structural information has prevented the generation of a mutant specifically defective in this function while preserving the proper folding and integrity of the entire protein . This issue is pertinent since it has been shown that actin polymerization by itself , when triggered by microbial pathogens , can activate innate immune signaling ( 48 ) . To address this issue , we introduced mutations in SipA residues that are implicated in the formation of its interface with actin and examined their effect on F - actin - binding and G - actin polymerization . Reflecting the redundant nature of the SipA - actin interface , none of the individual mutations introduced significantly affected the ability of SipA to bind actin . However , introduction of changes in 2 or more SipA residues involved in forming its interface with actin significantly reduced its binding affinity . Notably , simultaneous mutations in S537 and K636 , which interact with the D - loop and C - terminus of actin , resulted in a drastic reduction in its binding affinity ( Supplementary Fig . 7 and Fig . 6A ) . To examine the contribution of the actin - binding activity of SipA in the interaction of S . Typhimurium with host cells , we constructed a mutant strain expressing the sipA S537E / K636E allele from its native chromosomal context . We then tested the resulting strain for its ability to stimulate actin - cytoskeletal rearrangements and invade cultured epithelial cells . We found that , in comparison to wild type , the actin cytoskeletal changes stimulated by the S . Typhimurium sipA S537E / K636E mutant strain were more restricted ( Fig . 6B ) . Consistent with the more limited actin rearrangements , the invasion ability of the mutant strain was significantly impaired when measured with two independent assays ( Fig . 6C - 6E ) . Importantly , the phenotype of the S . Typhimurium sipA S537E / K636E mutant strain was indistinguishable from the phenotype of the S . 11 Typhimurium ∆sipA mutant , further demonstrating that the introduced mutations largely eliminated its ability to bind actin ( Fig . 6C - 6E ) . To examine the potential contribution of the actin - modulating activity of SipA to stimulate inflammation , we compared the intestinal inflammatory response of mice that have been infected with wild - type S . Typhimurium , and isogenic mutants either lacking sipA or expressing the actin - binding defective mutant SipA S536 / K635 . We found that after oral infection and as previously reported ( 27 ) , the S . Typhimurium ∆sipA mutant strain was significantly impaired in its ability to stimulate intestinal inflammation . In contrast , the S . Typhimurium sipA S536 / K635 mutant strain exhibited significantly enhanced ability to stimulate intestinal inflammation compared to wild type ( Fig . 6F ) . These results indicate that the actin - binding activity of SipA is not required to stimulate intestinal inflammation . In addition , the enhanced ability of the mutant strain to stimulate inflammation suggests that the two activities are not only independent from one another but that may be carried out by different SipA molecules operating independently on different targets . Discussion Bacterial effector proteins with the ability to modulate cellular processes are often evolutionary designed to mimic the activities of eukaryotic proteins that carry out a similar function ( 49 , 50 ) . This mimicry often involves convergent evolution since many of these bacterial mimics do not exhibit either primary sequence or structural similarity to their eukaryotic counterparts ( 49 ) . The actin - binding effector protein SipA has been postulated to be a mimic of the actin - binding protein nebulin ( 30 ) . In addition , it has been proposed to exert its actin - stabilizing function by working as a " molecular staple " , making use of a carboxy terminal domain and two flexible arms to bind actin monomers on opposing actin strands ( 29 ) . However , the lack of high - resolution structural information of SipA bound to actin filaments has prevented the rigorous testing of these hypotheses . To address these issues , we solved the cryo - EM structure of the actin - binding 12 carboxyterminal domain of SipA bound to actin . We found that SipA simultaneously engages 4 actin monomers through interactions largely involving its globular carboxy terminal domain . The SipA binding sites on actin overlap those of nebulin , a very large muscle skeletal protein , which through the tandem arrangement of multiple actin - binding domain repeats can engage up to 200 actin monomers ( 39 ) . Our structure showed that SipA and nebulin bind the same groove in the actin filaments and share some of the actin residues necessary for their interaction . This observation therefore is consistent with the notion that SipA and the nebulin repeat exhibit a similar actin - binding mode . Our structure also showed that the SipA actin - binding site also overlaps with the binding site of the well - characterized actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 complex . This observation has potential functional relevance since it suggests that SipA is likely to interfere with the binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex , thus potentially preventing the branching of SipA - stabilized actin filaments . However , more experiments will be required to test this hypothesis and to examine its potential functional significance . It has been previously shown that SipA prevents the activity of the actin - severing proteins ADF / cofilin ( 25 ) , thus further stabilizing SipA - bound actin filaments , which is thought to promote the formation of more pronounced ruffles . Our structure provides a mechanistic explanation for such activity . Although the actin - binding sites of SipA and ADF / Cofilin do not overlap , SipA binding triggers a conformational change in actin that disrupts the ADF / Cofilin binding site in a manner that leads to predicted structural clashes . The binding of cofilin to actin subunits drives a significant conformational change from a flattened to a twisted configuration . Residues in H4 and L3 of SipA bind to the D - loop of actin subunits and stabilize the flattened conformation , which would interfere with ADF / Cofilin binding . Unlike what was observed in a previous low resolution cryo - EM structure of SipA bound to actin ( 29 ) , our structure did not show the presence of non - globular arms engaging actin monomers on the opposite strand of the actin filaments and therefore could not confirm the 13 " molecular staple " model . However , an unstructured extension at the C - terminal end , which insert deep into the actin filament , was apparent in our structure . Furthermore , as previously shown , we found that this extension is required for the ability of SipA to increase the efficiency of bacterial invasion of cultured epithelial cells . Most likely , the contribution of this extension to bacterial invasion is related to SipA ' s role in facilitating the polimerization of G - actin but not to its ability to stabilize F - actin since removal of this extension altered the former but not the latter . In addition to its ability to modulate actin dynamics to mediate bacterial invasion , SipA has been also implicated in the stimulation of intestinal inflammation ( 26 , 27 ) , which is critical for S . Typhimurium virulence ( 51 ) . Although the mechanisms by which SipA modulates the inflammatory response are poorly understood , this activity has been largely correlated with its amino terminal domain ( 26 , 27 , 47 ) . However , as the modulation of actin dynamics by bacterial pathogens has also been linked to the stimulation of innate immune responses involving inflammation ( 48 ) , it has been unclear whether the carboxy terminal , actin - binding domain of SipA contributes to this phenotype . Indeed , the lack of structural information for the SipA - actin interface has hampered previous efforts to obtain a mutant that would specifically lack this activity without altering the overall structure of this effector protein ( 28 ) . This issue is complicated by the redundant nature of the SipA - actin interface . In fact , a previously reported mutant utilized in a study to attempt to address this issue ( 28 ) in our hands retains the ability to modulate actin dynamics ( Fig . 6 ) . Using structurally guided mutagenesis we were able to identify a mutant that is specifically defective in actin binding without altering the overall conformation of SipA . As predicted by its inability to bind actin , an S . Typhimurium strain expressing this mutant stimulated more limited actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and was defective in bacterial invasion of cultured epithelial cells . In fact , these phenotypes were indistinguishable from those of a S . Typhimurium strain lacking sipA . To address the potential contribution of the actin - binding activity to the stimulation of intestinal inflammation , we tested the S . Typhimurium strain expressing the actin - binding defective SipA mutant for its ability to stimulate intestinal inflammation in a mouse model of infection . We found that , 14 surprisingly , the S . Typhimurium strain expressing the SipA mutant was able to stimulate increased inflammation in comparison to wild type . These results indicate that the actin - binding activity of SipA does not contribute to its ability to induce inflammation . In fact , the heightened inflammatory response triggered by the mutant defective in actin binding suggest that the two activities are not only independent but that may well compete with one another . It is likely that due to the high binding affinity , F - actin may act as a " sink " , thus preventing a sub - pool of SipA from engaging in functions related to the stimulation of the inflammatory response . Therefore , the inability to bind actin may free more SipA molecules to carry out its inflammatory function . Taken together , our structure function studies have revealed a unique mechanism by which a bacterial effector protein modulates actin dynamics . Indeed , its ability to bind four actin monomers with a single globular domain has not been previously reported for other actin - binding proteins . Furthermore , our studies have clarified the mechanism of action of this effector protein and provide unique insight into the Salmonella spp . virulence mechanisms . 15 Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions The wild - type Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 strain and its ∆sipA isogenic mutant have been previously described ( 20 ) . The S . Typhimurium SL1344 derivative encoding SipA S537E / K636E was constructed by allelic exchange as previously described ( 52 ) . All bacterial strains were cultured in L - Broth containing 0 . 3 M NaCl to an OD600 of 0 . 9 , conditions that are known to stimulate the expression of the SPI - 1 T3SS ( 53 ) . Plasmid construction , protein expression , and purification . DNA manipulations were carried out using the standard Gibson assembly protocol ( 54 ) . S . Typhimurium SipA 447 - 685 was expressed in a modified pQE vector with GST and a His 6 tags at its amino and carboxy terminal ends , respectively . SipA 447 - 685 , SipA 498 - 659 , and SipA 513 - 659 , as well as SipA 447 - 685 carrying specific point mutations were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) and purified using affinity chromatography . Briefly , bacterial cells were cultured in LB medium at 37°C to an absorbance at OD 600 of 0 . 8 to 1 . 0 , induced with 0 . 2 mM isopropyl β - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside and grow for an additional 16 to 20 hs at 20°C . The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using a One Shot cell disrupter following the manufacturer’s instructions ( Constant Systems Ltd . , Daventry , United Kingdom ) . Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant was loaded onto a Glutathione column . After elution , the GST tag was removed by digestion with HRV 3C protease . The digested protein mixture was further purified by passing through a second Glutathione column and a Ni 2 + – nitrilotriacetic acid column . Actin was purified as previously reported ( 55 ) . Briefly , actin was purified from chicken muscle acetone powder which was made from flash - frozen chicken ( purchased from a local Trader Joe’s store ) . After one cycle of polymerization and depolymerization , G - actin was 16 isolated by gel filtration through Sephacryl S - 300 in Ca - G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris ⋅ HCl , pH 8 . 0 ; 0 . 2 mM ATP ; 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 ; 1 mM NaN3 ; 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . Cell culture , bacterial infections , and visualization of the actin cytoskeleton All cell lines were routinely tested for the presence of mycoplasma by a standard PCR method , checked for their morphological features , growth characteristics and functionalities , but were not authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling . The ability of S . Typhimurium strains to invade cultured human intestinal epithelial Henle - 407 cells ( obtained from the Roy Curtiss III collection in 1987 ) using the gentamicin protection assay was carried out as described previously ( 56 ) . Briefly , ~ 24 hs after seeding onto tissue culture plates , cells were infected for the indicated time with the indicated S . Typhimurium strains with a m . o . i . of 20 . Infected cells were washed and incubated for 2 hs in DMEM containing gentamicin ( 100 µg ml −1 ) to kill extracellular bacteria . Alternatively , bacterial invasion was also measured using a differential staining protocol ( inside - out staining ) as described before ( 57 ) . Briefly , cells were infected as indicated above and 20 min after infection , the cells were fixed in formalin and stained with rabbit anti - Salmonella lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) antibody ( SIFIN , catalog no . : TS 1624 ) , followed by fluorescently labeled ( Alexa Fluor 488 ) secondary anti - rabbit antibody . Cells were subsequently permeabilize with Triton X 100 ( 0 . 5 % ) and stained with the anti - Salmonella LPS antibody followed by a fluorescently labeled ( Alexa Fluor 594 ) anti - rabbit secondary antibody . In this protocol , extracellular bacteria are stained by both secondary antibodies while intracellular bacteria are only stained by the Alexa Fluor 594 - labeled secondary antibody . Quantification of internalized bacteria was carried out by capturing a minimum of 30 fields per condition ( containing a minimum of 1000 cells each ) on a Nikon Eclipse inverted microscope equipped with an Andor’s Zyla 5 . 5 sCMOS camera . To visualize actin cytoskeleton rearrangements due to bacterial invasion , cells were infected , fixed , and permeabilized as indicated above and then stained with rhodamine - labeled 17 phalloidin ( to visualize the actin cytoskeleton ) , an anti - S . Typhimurium LPS antibody ( SIFIN , catalog no . : TS 1624 ) , and Alexa Fluor 594 fluorescently labeled secondary antibody to visualize bacteria . Cells were visualized under an Andor Dragonfly spin disc fluorescence microscope ( Oxford Scientific ) . Mouse infections and measurement of intestinal inflammation Groups of age - and sex - matched C57BL / 6 mice were orally administered streptomycin ( 100 µl of 200 mg / ml solution ) and 24 hs after antibiotic treatment were orally infected by stomach gavage with 10 7 cfu in 100 μl of PBS with the indicated strains . Three days after infection , feces were collected and the levels of lipocalin per 100 mg of feces , a measure of intestinal inflammation , were determined using a commercial kit ( RayBiotech ELM - Lipocalin2 - 1 ) following the manufacturer ' s instructions . The sample sizes were empirically determined to optimize the numbers based on our previous experience with equivalent experiments . The mice were randomly assigned to the experimental groups , but experimenters were not blind to the assignment . EM sample preparation , data acquisition , and image processing Purified G - actin was first polymerized in KMEI buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA and 10 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 5 ) for 20 min , followed by the addition of SipA with a molar ratio of 1 . 7 : 1 . The CapZ protein was added into the polymerized actin filaments with a molar ratio of 1 : 30 to avoid the formation of long and bundled actin filaments . For negative staining , actin filaments or SipA decorated actin filaments were applied onto glow - discharged carbon - coated grids and negatively stained with 0 . 8 % ( wt / vol ) uranyl formate . Images were collected using a Talos L120C electron Microscope ( Thermo Fisher ) operating at 120 kV . For cryo - EM analysis , 3 µl of sample were deposited onto glow - discharged Quantifoil R2 / 1 300 Mesh Gold Holey Carbon Grids ( SPI supplies ) and plunged into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot 18 Mark IV ( Thermo Fisher ) at 10°C and 100 % humidity . The freezing conditions were screened on a Glacios cryo TEM ( Thermo Fisher ) operating at 200 kV . Cryo - EM data collection was performed using a Titan Krios electron microscope ( Thermo Fisher ) equipped with a K3 direct electron detector ( Gatan ) operating at 300 kV . Data were collected at a calibrated magnification of 81 , 000 x ( 1 . 068 Å per pixel ) in super resolution mode , with defocus values between −2 . 5 µm and −1 . 2 µm . Images were recorded using the beam image shift implemented in SerialEM ( 58 ) . Forty - four frames were taken at 0 . 05s per frame , with a dose rate of 29 e− per pixel per s . In total 4740 movies were recorded with an exposure time of 2 . 2 s . Motion correction and contrast transfer function ( CTF ) estimation were done using Relion 4 . 0 ( 59 ) . Particles were manually picked by using sxhelixboxer . py in SPARX ( 60 ) . Layer - line images were calculated with SPARX ( project and periodogram commands ) ( Supplementary Fig . 8 , ) In total , 320 , 109 particle segmentations were boxed out from 2 , 370 images and subjected to further 2D and 3D calculations in Relion 4 . 0 . The cryo - EM structure of ADP - Pi - Actin ( EMDB accession number : 7937 ) was used as the initial model ( rise : 110 Å and twist : 53 . 2 O ) were imposed on the reconstruction . Due to the low map occupancy of SipA , a local map enhancement approach ( DeepEMhancer ) ( 33 ) was used to improve map visibility and connectivity . The final map has a global nominal resolution of 3 . 6 Å ( based on the FSC using the 0 . 143 criterion ) . All the structural calculations were carried out on the Yale High Performance Computing servers . Model Building and refinement . The cryo - EM structure of ADP - Actin ( PDB ID : 6DJON ) ( 38 ) and crystal structure of SipA ( PDB ID : 1Q5Z ) ( 29 ) were used as initial templates to dock into the EM density maps using Chimera ( 35 ) . The modeled structure was manually adjusted in Coot ( 61 ) and refined with Phenix ( 62 ) . The SipA - actin interfaces was calculated with PDBePISA ( 63 ) . Figures were generated using Coot , PyMOL , and Chimera . 19 Actin co - sedimentation assay . To test the binding affinity of the different SipA mutants , actin monomers were first polymerized into filaments in KMEI buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA and 10 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 5 ) for 20 min . Then different concentrations ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 10 µM ) of polymerized actin filaments were incubated with 4 µM of SipA for 10 min at room temperature . Followed by ultracentrifugation at 120 , 000 × g in a TL100 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Fullerton , CA ) at 4°C for 30 min , equal amount of the supernatant from every reaction were loaded onto SDS – PAGE Gel and stained with Coomassie blue . To test the actin nucleation activity of SipA 447 - 685 , SipA 498 - 659 , and SipA 513 - 659 , the SipA proteins were first dialyzed against a Tris buffer without salt ( 25 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ) three times before adding to G actin . After 4 h incubation , the samples were ultracentrifuged at 120 , 000 × g in a TL100 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Fullerton , CA ) at 4°C for 30 min , then equal amount of the supernatant and pellet from every reaction were loaded onto SDS – PAGE Gel and stained with Coomassie blue .
