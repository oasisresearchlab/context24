We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance , face masks , and eye protection on virus transmission in health - care and non - health - care ( eg , community ) settings . Methods We did a systematic review and meta - analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person - to - person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses . We obtained data for SARS - CoV - 2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome , and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO - specific and COVID - 19 - specific sources . We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3 , 2020 , with no restriction by language , for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability , feasibility , resource use , and equity . We screened records , extracted data , and assessed risk of bias in duplicate . We did frequentist and Bayesian meta - analyses and random - effects meta - regressions . We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach . This study is registered with PROSPERO , CRD42020177047 . Findings Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents , with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health - care and non - health - care settings ( n = 25 697 patients ) . Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more , compared with a distance of less than 1 m ( n = 10 736 , pooled adjusted odds ratio [ aOR ] 0·18 , 95 % CI 0·09 to 0·38 ; risk difference [ RD ] – 10·2 % , 95 % CI – 11·5 to – 7·5 ; moderate certainty ) ; protection was increased as distance was lengthened ( change in relative risk [ RR ] 2·02 per m ; p interaction = 0·041 ; moderate certainty ) . Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection ( n = 2647 ; aOR 0·15 , 95 % CI 0·07 to 0·34 , RD – 14·3 % , – 15·9 to – 10·7 ; low certainty ) , with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar ( eg , reusable 12 – 16 - layer cotton masks ; p interaction = 0·090 ; posterior probability > 95 % , low certainty ) . Eye protection also was associated with less infection ( n = 3713 ; aOR 0·22 , 95 % CI 0·12 to 0·39 , RD – 10·6 % , 95 % CI – 12·5 to – 7·7 ; low certainty ) . Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings . Interpretation The findings of this systematic review and meta - analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy . Optimum use of face masks , respirators , and eye protection in public and health - care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors . Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions , but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance .

Introduction As of May 28 , 2020 , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has infected more than 5·85 million individuals worldwide and caused more than 359 000 deaths . 1 Emergency lockdowns have been initiated in countries across the globe , and the effect on health , wellbeing , business , and other aspects of daily life are felt throughout societies and by individuals . With no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccine available in the imminent future , reducing the rate of infection ( ie , flattening the curve ) is a priority , and prevention of infection is the best approach to achieve this aim . SARS - CoV - 2 spreads person - to - person through close contact and causes COVID - 19 .

The distance from a patient that the virus is infective , and the optimum person - to - person physical distance , is uncertain . For the currently foreseeable future ( ie , until a safe and effective vaccine or treatment becomes avail able ) , COVID - 19 prevention will con tinue to rely on non - pharmaceutical interventions , including pandemic mitigation in community settings . 9 Thus , quantitative assessment of physical distancing is relevant to inform safe interaction and care of patients with SARS - CoV - 2 in both health - care and non - health - care settings . The definition of close contact or potentially exposed helps to risk stratify , contact trace , and develop guidance docu ments , but these definitions differ around the globe . To contain widespread infection and to reduce morbidity and mortality among health - care workers and others in contact with potentially infected people , jurisdictions have issued conflicting advice about physical or social distancing . Use of face masks with or Research in context Evidence before this study We searched 21 databases and resources from inception to May 3 , 2020 , with no restriction by language , for studies of any design evaluating physical distancing , face masks , and eye protection to prevent transmission of the viruses that cause COVID - 19 and related diseases ( eg , severe acute respiratory syndrome [ SARS ] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [ MERS ] ) between infected individuals and people close to them ( eg , household members , caregivers , and health - care workers ) . Previous related meta - analyses have focused on randomised trials and reported imprecise data for common respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza , rather than the pandemic and epidemic betacoronaviruses causative of COVID - 19 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [ SARS - CoV - 2 ] ) , SARS ( SARS - CoV ) , or MERS ( MERS - CoV ) . Other meta - analyses have focused on interventions in the health - care setting and have not included non - health - care ( eg , community ) settings . Our search did not retrieve any systematic review of information on physical distancing , face masks , or eye protection to prevent transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , SARS - CoV , and MERS - CoV . Added value of this study We did a systematic review of 172 observational studies in health - care and non - health - care settings across 16 countries and six continents ; 44 comparative studies were included in a meta - analysis , including 25 697 patients with COVID - 19 , SARS , or MERS . Our findings are , to the best of our knowledge , the first to rapidly synthesise all direct information on COVID - 19 and , therefore , provide the best available evidence to inform optimum use of three common and simple interventions to help reduce the rate of infection and inform non - pharmaceutical interventions , including pandemic mitigation in non - health - care settings . Physical distancing of 1 m or more was associated with a much lower risk of infection , as was use of face masks ( including N95 respirators or similar and surgical or similar masks [ eg , 12 – 16 - layer cotton or gauze masks ] ) and eye protection ( eg , goggles or face shields ) . Added benefits are likely with even larger physical distances ( eg , 2 m or more based on modelling ) and might be present with N95 or similar respirators versus medical masks or similar . Across 24 studies in health - care and non - health - care settings of contextual factors to consider when formulating recommendations , most stakeholders found these personal protection strategies acceptable , feasible , and reassuring but noted harms and contextual challenges , including frequent discomfort and facial skin breakdown , high resource use linked with the potential to decrease equity , increased difficulty communicating clearly , and perceived reduced empathy of care providers by those they were caring for . Implications of all the available evidence In view of inconsistent guidelines by various organisations based on limited information , our findings provide some clarification and have implications for multiple stakeholders . The risk for infection is highly dependent on distance to the individual infected and the type of face mask and eye protection worn . From a policy and public health perspective , current policies of at least 1 m physical distancing seem to be strongly associated with a large protective effect , and distances of 2 m could be more effective . These data could also facilitate harmonisation of the definition of exposed ( eg , within 2 m ) , which has implications for contact tracing . The quantitative estimates provided here should inform disease - modelling studies , which are important for planning pandemic response efforts . Policy makers around the world should strive to promptly and adequately address equity implications for groups with currently limited access to face masks and eye protection . For health - care workers and administrators , our findings suggest that N95 respirators might be more strongly associated with protection from viral transmission than surgical masks . Both N95 and surgical masks have a stronger association with protection compared with single - layer masks . Eye protection might also add substantial protection . For the general public , evidence shows that physical distancing of more than 1 m is highly effective and that face masks are associated with protection , even in non - health - care settings , with either disposable surgical masks or reusable 12 – 16 - layer cotton ones , although much of this evidence was on mask use within households and among contacts of cases . Eye protection is typically underconsidered and can be effective in community settings . However , no intervention , even when properly used , was associated with complete protection from infection . Other basic measures ( eg , hand hygiene ) are still needed in addition to physical distancing and use of face masks and eye protection .

Evidence has been reviewed for other respiratory viral infections , mainly seasonal influenza , 12 , 13 but no comprehensive review is available of information on SARS - CoV - 2 or related betacoronaviruses that have caused epidemics , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) or Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) . We , therefore , systematically reviewed the effect of physical distance , face masks , and eye protection on transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , SARS - CoV , and MERS - CoV . Methods Search strategy and selection criteria To inform WHO guidance documents , on March 25 , 2020 , we did a rapid systematic review . 14 We created a large international collaborative and we used Cochrane meth - ods 15 and the GRADE approach . 16 We prospectively sub - mitted the systematic review protocol for registration on PROSPERO ( CRD42020177047 ; appendix pp 23 – 29 ) . We have followed PRISMA 17 and MOOSE 18 reporting guidelines ( appendix pp 30 – 33 ) . From database inception to May 3 , 2020 , we searched for studies of any design and in any setting that included patients with WHO - defined confirmed or probable COVID - 19 , SARS , or MERS , and people in close contact with them , comparing distances between people and COVID - 19 infected patients of 1 m or larger with smaller distances , with or without a face mask on the patient , or with or without a face mask , eye protection , or both on the exposed individual . The aim of our systematic review was for quantitative assessment to ascertain the physical distance associated with reduced risk of acquiring infection when caring for an individual infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , SARS - CoV , or MERS - CoV . Our definition of face masks included surgical masks and N95 respirators , among others ; eye protection included visors , faceshields , and goggles , among others . We searched ( up to March 26 , 2020 ) MEDLINE ( using the Ovid platform ) , PubMed , Embase , CINAHL ( using the Ovid platform ) , the Cochrane Library , COVID - 19 Open Research Dataset Challenge , COVID - 19 Research Database ( WHO ) , Epistemonikos ( for relevant systematic reviews addressing MERS and SARS , and its COVID - 19 Living Overview of the Evidence platform ) , EPPI Centre living systematic map of the evidence , ClinicalTrials . gov , WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform , relevant documents on the websites of governmental and other relevant organisations , reference lists of included papers , and relevant systematic reviews . 19 , 20 We hand - searched ( up to May 3 , 2020 ) preprint servers ( bioRxiv , medRxiv , and Social Science Research Network First Look ) and coronavirus resource centres of The Lancet , JAMA , and N Engl J Med ( appendix pp 3 – 5 ) . We did not limit our search by language . We initially could not obtain three full texts for evaluation , but we obtained them through interlibrary loan or contacting a study author . We did not restrict our search to any quantitative cutoff for distance . Data collection We screened titles and abstracts , reviewed full texts , extracted data , and assessed risk of bias by two authors and independently , using standardised prepiloted forms ( Covidence ; Veritas Health Innovation , Melbourne , VIC , Australia ) , and we cross - checked screening results using artificial intelligence ( Evidence Prime , Hamilton , ON , Canada ) . We resolved disagreements by consensus .

Outcomes Outcomes of interest were risk of transmission ( ie , WHO - defined confirmed or probable COVID - 19 , SARS , or MERS ) to people in health - care or non - health - care settings by those infected ; hospitalisation ; intensive care unit admission ; death ; time to recovery ; adverse effects of interventions ; and contextual factors such as acceptability , feasibility , effect on equity , and resource considerations related to the interventions of interest . However , data were only available to analyse intervention effects for transmission and con textual factors . Consistent with WHO , studies generally defined confirmed cases with laboratory confirmation ( with or without symptoms ) and probable cases with clinical evidence of the respective infection ( ie , suspected to be infected ) but for whom confirmatory testing either had not yet been done for any reason or was inconclusive . Data analysis Our search did not identify any randomised trials of COVID - 19 , SARS , or MERS . We did a meta - analysis of associations by pooling risk ratios ( RRs ) or adjusted odds ratios ( aORs ) depending on availability of these data from observational studies , using DerSimonian and Laird ran - dom - effects models . We adjusted for variables including age , sex , and severity of source case ; these variables were not the same across studies . Because between - study heterogeneity can be misleadingly large when quantified by I ² during meta - analysis of obser vational studies , 21 , 22 we used GRADE guidance to assess between - study hetero - geneity . 21 Throughout , we present RRs as unadjusted estimates and aORs as adjusted estimates . We used the Newcastle - Ottawa scale to rate risk of bias for comparative non - randomised studies corresponding to every study’s design ( cohort or case - control ) . 23 , 24 We planned to use the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 . 0 for randomised trials , 25 but our search did not identify any eligible randomised trials . We synthesised data in both narrative and tabular formats . We graded the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach . We used the GRADEpro app to rate evidence and present it in GRADE evidence profiles and summary of findings tables 26 , 27 using standardised terms . 28 , 29 We analysed data for subgroup effects by virus type , intervention ( different distances or face mask types ) , and setting ( health care vs non - health care ) . Among the studies assessing physical distancing measures to prevent viral transmission , the intervention varied ( eg , direct physical contact [ 0 m ] , 1 m , or 2 m ) . We , therefore , analysed the effect of distance on the size of the associ ations by random - effects univariate meta - regressions , using restricted maximum likelihood , and we present mean effects and 95 % CIs . We calculated tests for interaction using a minimum of 10 000 Monte Carlo random permutations to avoid spurious findings . 30 We formally assessed the credibility of potential effect - modifiers using GRADE guidance . 21 We did two sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings . First , we used Bayesian meta - analyses to reinterpret the included studies considering priors derived from the effect point estimate and variance from a meta - analysis of ten randomised trials evaluating face mask use versus no face mask use to prevent influenza - like illness in health - care workers . 31 Second , we used Bayesian meta - analyses to reinterpret the efficacy of N95 respirators versus medical masks on preventing influenza - like illness after seasonal viral ( mostly influenza ) infection . 13 For these sensitivity analyses , we used hybrid Metropolis - Hastings and Gibbs sampling , a 10 000 sample burn - in , 40 000 Markov chain Monte Carlo samples , and we tested non - informative and sceptical priors ( eg , four time variance ) 32 , 33 to inform n Country Setting Disease caused by virus Case definition ( WHO ) Adjusted estimates Risk of bias * ( Continued from previous page ) Wang et al ( 2020 ) 70 5442 China Health care COVID - 19 Confirmed No ∗∗∗∗∗ Wiboonchutikul et al ( 2016 ) 71 38 Thailand Health care MERS Confirmed No ∗∗∗∗∗ Wilder - Smith et al ( 2005 ) 72 80 Singapore Health care SARS Confirmed No ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ Wong et al ( 2004 ) 73 66 China Health care SARS Confirmed No ∗∗∗∗∗ Wu et al ( 2004 ) 74 375 China Non - health care ( community ) SARS Confirmed Yes ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ Yin et al ( 2004 ) 75 257 China Health care SARS Confirmed Yes ∗∗∗∗∗∗ Yu et al ( 2005 ) 76 74 China Health care SARS Confirmed No ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ Yu et al ( 2007 ) 77 124 wards China Health care SARS Confirmed Yes ∗∗∗∗∗∗∗ Across studies , mean age was 30 – 60 years .

Studies were all observational in nature ; no randomised trials were identified of any interventions that directly addressed the included study populations . Of the 172 studies , 66 focused on how far a virus can travel by comparing the association of different distances on virus transmission to people ( appendix pp 42 – 44 ) . Of these 66 studies , five were mechanistic , assessing viral RNA , virions , or both cultured from the environment of an infec ted patient ( appendix p 45 ) . 44 studies were comparative 34 – 77 and fulfilled criteria for our meta - analysis ( n = 25 697 ; figure 1 ; table 1 ) . We used these studies rather than case series and qualitative studies ( appendix pp 41 – 47 ) to inform estimates of effect . 30 studies 34 , 37 , 41 – 45 , 47 – 51 , 53 – 56 , 58 – 61 , 64 – 70 , 72 , 74 , 75 focused on the asso - ciation between use of various types of face masks and respirators by health - care workers , patients , or both with virus transmission . 13 studies 34 , 37 – 39 , 47 , 49 , 51 , 54 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 65 , 75 addressed the association of eye protection with virus transmission . Some direct evidence was available for COVID - 19 ( 64 studies , of which seven were comparative in design ) , 36 , 37 , 40 , 41 , 44 , 52 , 70 but most studies reported on SARS ( n = 55 ) or MERS ( n = 25 ; appendix pp 6 – 12 ) . Of the 44 comparative studies , 40 included WHO - defined confirmed cases , one included both confirmed and probable cases , and the remaining three studies included probable cases . There was no effect - modification by case - definition ( distance p interaction = 0·41 ; mask p interaction = 0·46 ; all cases for eye protection were confirmed ) . Most studies reported on bundled interven tions , including different components of PPE and distancing , which was usually addressed by statistical adjustment . The included studies all occurred during recurrent or novel outbreak settings of COVID - 19 , SARS , or MERS . Risk of bias was generally low - to - moderate after con sidering the observational designs ( table 1 ) , but both within studies and across studies the overall findings were similar between adjusted and unadjusted estimates . We did not detect strong evidence of publication bias in the body of evidence for any intervention ( appendix pp 15 – 18 ) . As we did not use case series data to inform estimates of effect of each intervention , we did not systematically rate risk of bias of these data . Therefore , we report further only those studies with comparative data .

Setting was any health - care or non - health - care setting . Outcomes were infection ( laboratory - confirmed or probable ) and contextual factors . Risk ( 95 % CI ) in intervention group is based on assumed risk in comparison group and relative effect ( 95 % CI ) of the intervention . All studies were non - randomised and evaluated using the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale ; some studies had a higher risk of bias than did others but no important difference was noted in sensitivity analyses excluding studies at higher risk of bias ; we did not further rate down for risk of bias . Although there was a high I 2 value ( which can be exaggerated in non - randomised studies ) 21 and no overlapping CIs , point estimates generally exceeded the thresholds for large effects and we did not rate down for inconsistency . We did not rate down for indirectness for the association between distance and infection because SARS - CoV - 2 , SARS - CoV , and MERS - CoV all belong to the same family and have each caused epidemics with sufficient similarity ; there was also no convincing statistical evidence of effect - modification across viruses ; some studies also used bundled interventions but the studies include only those that provide adjusted estimates . aOR = adjusted odds ratio . RR = relative risk . SARS - CoV - 2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . SARS - CoV = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus . MERS - CoV = Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus . * GRADE category of evidence ; high certainty ( we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect ) ; moderate certainty ( we are moderately confident in the effect estimate ; the true effect is probably close to the estimate , but it is possibly substantially different ) ; low certainty ( our confidence in the effect estimate is limited ; the true effect could be substantially different from the estimate of the effect ) ; very low certainty ( we have very little confidence in the effect estimate ; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect ) . †The effect is very large considering the thresholds set by GRADE , particularly at plausible levels of baseline risk , which also mitigated concerns about risk of bias ; data also suggest a dose – response gradient , with associations increasing from smaller distances to 2 m and beyond , by meta - regression ; we did not rate up for this domain alone but it further supports the decision to rate up in combination with the large effects . ‡The effect was very large , and the certainty of evidence could be rated up , but we made a conservative decision not to because of some inconsistency and risk of bias ; hence , although the effect is qualitatively highly certain , the precise quantitative effect is low certainty . § In a subgroup analysis comparing N95 respirators with surgical or similar masks ( eg , 12 – 16 - layer cotton ) , the association was more pronounced in the N95 group ( aOR 0·04 , 95 % CI 0·004 – 0·30 ) compared with other masks ( 0·33 , 0·17 – 0·61 ; p interaction = 0·090 ) ; there was also support for effect - modification by formal analysis of subgroup credibility . ¶Two studies 54 , 75 provided adjusted estimates with n = 295 in the eye protection group and n = 406 in the group not wearing eye protection ; results were similar to the unadjusted estimate ( aOR 0·22 , 95 % CI 0·12 – 0·39 ) . | | The effect is large considering the thresholds set by GRADE assuming that ORs translate into similar magnitudes of RR estimates ; this mitigates concerns about risk of bias , but we conservatively decided not to rate up for large or very large effects .

Although there were six studies on COVID - 19 , the association was seen irrespective of causative virus ( p interaction = 0·49 ) , health - care setting versus non - health - care setting ( p interaction = 0·14 ) , and by type of face mask ( p interaction = 0·95 ; appendix pp 17 , 19 ) . However , different studies used different distances for the intervention . By meta - regression , the strength of association was larger with increasing distance ( 2·02 change in RR per m , 95 % CI 1·08 to 3·76 ; p interaction = 0·041 ; moderate credibility sub group effect ; figure 3A ; table 2 ) . AR values with increasing distance given different degrees of baseline risk are shown in figure 3B , with potential values at 3 m also shown . Across 29 unadjusted studies and ten adjusted studies , 34 , 37 , 41 – 45 , 47 – 51 , 53 – 56 , 58 – 61 , 64 – 70 , 72 , 74 , 75 the use of both N95 or similar respirators or face masks ( eg , disposable surgical masks or similar reusable 12 – 16 - layer cotton masks ) by those exposed to infected individuals was associated with a large reduction in risk of infection ( unadjusted n = 10 170 , RR 0·34 , 95 % CI 0·26 to 0·45 ; adjusted studies n = 2647 , aOR 0·15 , 95 % CI 0·07 to 0·34 ; AR 3·1 % with face mask vs 17·4 % with no face mask , RD – 14·3 % , 95 % CI – 15·9 to – 10·7 ; low certainty ; figure 4 ; table 2 ; appendix pp 16 , 18 ) with stronger associ ations in health - care settings ( RR 0·30 , 95 % CI 0·22 to 0·41 ) compared with non - health - care settings ( RR 0·56 , 95 % CI 0·40 to 0·79 ; p interaction = 0·049 ; low - to - moderate credibility for subgroup effect ; figure 4 ; appendix p 19 ) . When differential N95 or similar respirator use , which was more frequent in health - care settings than in non - health - care settings , was adjusted for the possibility that face masks were less effective in non - health - care settings , the subgroup effect was slightly less credible ( p interaction = 0·11 , adjusted for differential respirator use ; figure 4 ) . Indeed , the association with protection from infection was more pronounced with N95 or similar respirators ( aOR 0·04 , 95 % CI 0·004 to 0·30 ) compared with other masks ( aOR 0·33 , 95 % CI 0·17 to 0·61 ; p interaction = 0·090 ; moderate credibility subgroup effect ; figure 5 ) . The interaction was also seen when addit - ionally adjusting for three studies that clearly reported aerosol - generating procedures ( p interaction = 0·048 ; figure 5 ) . Supportive evidence for this interaction was also seen in within - study comparisons ( eg , N95 had a stronger protective association compared with surgical masks or 12 – 16 - layer cotton masks ) ; both N95 and surgical masks also had a stronger association with protection versus single - layer masks . 38 , 39 , 51 , 53 , 54 , 61 , 66 , 67 , 75 We did a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings and to integrate all available information on face mask treatment effects for protection from COVID - 19 . We reconsidered our findings using ran - dom - effects Bayesian meta - analysis . Although non - informative priors showed similar results to frequentist approaches ( aOR 0·16 , 95 % CrI 0·04 – 0·40 ) , even using informative priors from the most recent meta - analysis on the effectiveness of masks versus no masks to prevent influenza - like illness ( RR 0·93 , 95 % CI 0·83 – 1·05 ) 31 yielded a significant association with protection from COVID - 19 ( aOR 0·40 , 95 % CrI 0·16 – 0·97 ; posterior probability for RR < 1 , 98 % ) .

Articles 10 www . thelancet . com Published online June 1 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S0140 - 6736 ( 20 ) 31142 - 9 Discussion The findings of this systematic review of 172 studies ( 44 comparative studies ; n = 25 697 patients ) on COVID - 19 , SARS , and MERS provide the best available evidence that current policies of at least 1 m physical distancing are associated with a large reduction in infection , and distances of 2 m might be more effective . These data also suggest that wearing face masks protects people ( both health - care workers and the general public ) against infection by these coronaviruses , and that eye protection could confer additional benefit . However , none of these interventions afforded complete protection from infection , and their optimum role might need risk assessment and several contextual considerations . No randomised trials were identified for these interventions in COVID - 19 , SARS , or MERS . Previous reviews are limited in that they either have not provided any evidence from COVID - 19 or did not use direct evidence from other related emerging epidemic betacoronaviruses ( eg , SARS and MERS ) to inform the effects of interventions to curtail the current COVID - 19 pandemic . 13 , 19 , 31 , 78 Previous data from randomised trials are mainly for common respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza , with a systematic review concluding low certainty of evidence for extrapolating these findings to COVID - 19 . 13 Further , previous syntheses of available randomised control led trials have not accounted for cluster effects in analyses , leading to substantial imprecision in treatment effect estimates . In between - study and within - study comparisons , we noted a larger effect of N95 or similar respirators compared with other masks . This finding is inconsistent with conclusions of a review of four randomised trials , 13 in which low certainty of evidence for no larger effect was suggested . However , in that review , the CIs were wide so a meaningful protective effect could not be excluded . We harmonised these findings with Bayesian approaches , using indirect data from randomised trials to inform posterior estimates . Despite this step , our findings continued to support the ideas not only that masks in general are associated with a large reduction in risk of infection from SARS - CoV - 2 , SARS - CoV , and MERS - CoV but also that N95 or similar respirators might be associated with a larger degree of protec tion from viral infection than disposable medical masks or reusable multilayer ( 12 – 16 - layer ) cotton masks . Nevertheless , in view of the limitations of these data , we did not rate the certainty of effect as high . 21 Our findings accord with those of a cluster randomised trial showing a potential benefit of continuous N95 respirator use over medical masks against seasonal viral infections . 79 Further high - quality research , including randomised trials of the optimum physical distance and the effectiveness of different types of masks in the general population and for health - care workers’ protection , is urgently needed . Two trials are registered to better in form the optimum use of face masks for COVID - 19 ( NCT04296643 [ n = 576 ] and Figure 5 : Forest plot showing adjusted estimates for the association of face mask use with viral infection causing COVID - 19 , SARS , or MERS SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome .

Until such data are available , our findings represent the current best estimates to inform face mask use to reduce infection from COVID - 19 . We recognise that there are strong , perhaps opposing , sentiments about policy making during outbreaks . In one viewpoint , the 2007 SARS Commission report stated : “ . . . recognize , as an aspect of health worker safety , the precautionary principle that reasonable action to reduce risk , such as the use of a fitted N95 respirator , need not await scientific certainty” . 80 “ . . . if we do not learn from SARS and we do not make the government fix the problems that remain , we will pay a terrible price in the next pandemic” . 81 A counter viewpoint is that the scientific uncertainty and contextual considerations require a more nuanced approach . Although challenging , policy makers must carefully consider these two viewpoints along with our findings . We found evidence of moderate certainty that current policies of at least 1 m physical distancing are probably associated with a large reduction in infection , and that distances of 2 m might be more effective , as implemented in some countries . We also provide estimates for 3 m . The main benefit of physical distancing measures is to prevent onward transmission and , thereby , reduce the adverse outcomes of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Hence , the results of our current review support the implementation of a policy of physical distancing of at least 1 m and , if feasible , 2 m or more . Our findings also provide robust estimates to inform models and contact tracing used to plan and strategise for pandemic response efforts at multiple levels . The use of face masks was protective for both health - care workers and people in the community exposed to infection , with both the frequentist and Bayesian analyses lending support to face mask use irrespective of setting . Our unadjusted analyses might , at first impression , suggest use of face masks in the community setting to be less effective than in the health - care setting , but after accounting for differential N95 respirator use between health - care and non - health - care settings , we did not detect any striking differences in effectiveness of Figure 6 : Forest plot showing the association of eye protection with risk of COVID - 19 , SARS , or MERS transmission Forest plot shows unadjusted estimates .

The credibility of effect - modification across settings was , therefore , low . Wearing face masks was also acceptable and feasible . Policy makers at all levels should , therefore , strive to address equity implications for groups with currently limited access to face masks and eye protection . One concern is that face mask use en masse could divert supplies from people at highest risk for infection . 10 Health - care workers are increasingly being asked to ration and reuse PPE , 82 , 83 leading to calls for government - directed repurposing of manufacturing capacity to overcome mask shortages 84 and finding solutions for mask use by the general public . 84 In this respect , some of the masks studied in our review were reusable 12 – 16 - layer cotton or gauze masks . 51 , 54 , 61 , 75 At the moment , although there is consensus that SARS - CoV - 2 mainly spreads through large droplets and contact , debate continues about the role of aerosol , 2 – 8 , 85 , 86 but our meta - analysis provides evidence ( albeit of low certainty ) that respirators might have a stronger protective effect than surgical masks . Biological plausi bility would be supported by data for aerosolised SARS - CoV - 2 5 – 8 and preclinical data showing seasonal coronavirus RNA detection in fine aerosols during tidal breathing , 87 albeit , RNA detection does not necessarily imply replication and infection - competent virus . Nevertheless , our findings suggest it plausible that even in the absence of aerosolisation , respirators might be simply more effective than masks at preventing infection . At present , there is no data to support viable virus in the air outside of aerosol generating procedures from available hospital studies . Other factors such as super - spreading events , the subtype of health - care set - ting ( eg , emergency room , intensive care unit , medical wards , dialysis centre ) , if aerosolising proce dures are done , and environmental factors such as ventilation , might all affect the degree of protection afforded by personal protection strategies , but we did not identify robust data to inform these aspects . Strengths of our review include adherence to full systematic review methods , which included artificial intel - ligence - supported dual screening of titles and abstracts , full - text evaluation , assessment of risk of bias , and no limitation by language . We included patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , SARS - CoV , or MERS - CoV and searched relevant data up to May 3 , 2020 . We followed the GRADE approach 16 to rate the certainty of evidence . Finally , we identified and appraise a large body of published work from China , from which much evidence emerged before the pandemic spread to other global regions . The primary limitation of our study is that all studies were non - randomised , not always fully adjusted , and might suffer from recall and measurement bias ( eg , direct contact in some studies might not be measuring near distance ) . However , unadjusted , adjusted , frequentist , and Bayesian meta - analyses all supported the main findings , and large or very large effects were recorded . Nevertheless , we are cautious not to be overly certain in the precise quantitative estimates of effects , although the qualitative effect and direction is probably of high certainty . Many studies did not provide information on precise distances , and direct contact was equated to 0 m distance ; none of the eligible studies quanti tatively evaluated whether distances of more than 2 m were more effective , although our meta - regression provides potential pre dictions for estimates of risk . Few studies assessed the effect of interventions in non - health - care settings , and they primarily evaluated mask use in households or contacts of cases , although beneficial associations were seen across settings . Furthermore , most evidence was from studies that reported on SARS and MERS ( n = 6674 patients with COVID - 19 , of 25 697 total ) , but data from these previous epidemics provide the most direct information for COVID - 19 currently . We did not specifically assess the effect of duration of exposure on risk for transmission , although whether or not this variable was judged a risk factor considerably varied across studies , from any duration to a minimum of 1 h . Because of inconsistent reporting , information is limited about whether aerosol - generating procedures were in place in studies using respirators , and whether masks worn by infected patients might alter the effectiveness of each intervention , although the stronger association with N95 or similar respirators over other masks persisted when adjusting for studies reporting aerosol - generating medical procedures . These factors might account for some of the residual statistical heterogeneity seen for some outcomes , albeit I ² is com - monly inflated in meta - analyses of observational data , 21 , 22 and nevertheless the effects seen were large and probably clinically important in all adjusted studies . Our comprehensive systematic review provides the best available information on three simple and com - mon interventions to combat the immediate threat of COVID - 19 , while new evidence on pharmacological treat - ments , vac cines , and other personal protective strategies is being generated . Physical distancing of at least 1 m is strongly associated with protection , but distances of up to 2 m might be more effective . Although direct evidence is limited , the optimum use of face masks , in particular N95 or similar respirators in health - care settings and 12 – 16 - layer cotton or surgical masks in the community , could depend on contextual factors ; action is needed at all levels to address the paucity of better evidence . Eye protection might provide additional benefits . Globally collaborative and well conducted studies , including randomised trials , of different personal protective strategies are needed regardless of the challenges , but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence could be considered to inform interim guidance .
