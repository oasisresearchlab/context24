We show that for networks with 3 < λ < 4 , known to undergo a transition at a ﬁnite threshold of dilution , the critical exponents are diﬀerent than the expected mean - ﬁeld values of regular percolation in inﬁnite dimensions . Networks with 2 < λ < 3 possess only a percolative phase . Nevertheless , we show that in this case percolation critical exponents are well deﬁned , near the limit of extreme dilution ( where all sites are removed ) , and that also then the exponents bear a strong λ - dependence . The regular mean - ﬁeld values are recovered only for λ > 4 . 02 . 50 . Cw , 05 . 40 . a , 05 . 50 . + q , 64 . 60 . Ak Large networks have been attracting considerable in - terest [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] . A useful characterization of such net - works is their degree distribution , P ( k ) , or the probabil - ity that an arbitrary node be connected to exactly k other nodes . Many naturally occurring networks ( the Internet , nets of social contacts , scientiﬁc collaborations , ecologi - cal nets of predator - pray , etc . , ) exhibit a power - law , or scale - free degree distribution : P ( k ) = ck − λ , k ≥ m . ( 1 ) where m is the minimal connectivity ( usually taken to be m = 1 ) and c is a normalization factor . Imagine that a large network is diluted , by random removal of a fraction p of its nodes . If p is small , one expects that the network remains essentially connected : there exists a giant component of connected nodes that constitutes a ﬁnite fraction of the total size of the original network . Above a certain threshold of dilution , p c , the giant component disappears and the network eﬀectively disintegrates . This is the problem of percolation [ 7 , 8 ] as deﬁned on networks . ( Percolation was originally deﬁned on regular lattices . ) The giant component corresponds to the inﬁnite incipient cluster or spanning cluster which forms only in the percolating phase , at dilutions smaller than the percolation threshold p c . Percolation in scale - free networks is widely recognized as a key problem of interest [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] . Applications range from the robustness of communication networks ( the Internet , phone networks ) in the face of random fail - ure ( removal ) of a fraction of their nodes ( e . g . , random breakdown of routers ) , to the eﬃciency of inoculation strategies against the spread of disease , to the ecological impact of the extinction of some species . For a random network of arbitrary degree distribu - tion , the condition for the existence of a spanning cluster is [ 5 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] : κ ≡ h k 2 i h k i > 2 . ( 2 ) Suppose a fraction p of the nodes ( and their links ) are removed from the network . ( Alternatively , a fraction q = 1 − p of the nodes are retained . ) The original degree distribution , P ( k ) , becomes P ′ ( k ) = ∞ X l = k P ( l ) (cid:16) l k (cid:17) ( 1 − p ) k p l − k . ( 3 ) In view of this new P ′ ( k ) , Eq . ( 2 ) yields the percolation threshold : q c = 1 − p c = 1 κ − 1 , ( 4 ) where κ is computed with respect to the original distri - bution , P ( k ) , before dilution . Applying the criterion ( 4 ) to scale - free networks one concludes that for λ > 3 a phase transition exists at a ﬁnite q c , whereas for 2 < λ < 3 the transition takes place only at the extreme limit of dilution of q c = 0 [ 5 , 6 ] . Here we concern ourselves with the critical exponents associ - ated with the percolation transition in scale - free networs of λ > 2 . We show that critical exponents are well de - ﬁned ( and we compute their λ - dependent values ) even in the non - percolative regime of 2 < λ < 3 . In the per - colative range of λ > 3 , we ﬁnd λ - dependent exponents which diﬀer from the regular mean - ﬁeld values of per - colation in inﬁnite dimensions . This irregularity can be traced to the fat tail of the distribution ( 1 ) . The regular mean - ﬁeld exponents are recovered only for λ > 4 . In [ 4 , 12 ] a generating function is built for the connec - tivity distribution : ∗ e - mail : cohenr @ shoshi . ph . biu . ac . il 1 G 0 ( x ) = ∞ X k = 0 P ( k ) x k . ( 5 ) The probability of reaching a site with connectivity k by following a speciﬁc link is kP ( k ) / h k i [ 4 , 9 , 12 ] , and the corresponding generating function for those probabilities is G 1 ( x ) = P kP ( k ) x k − 1 P kP ( k ) = d dxG 0 ( x ) / h k i . ( 6 ) Let H 1 ( x ) be the generating function for the probability of reaching a branch of a given size by following a link . After a dilution of a fraction p of the sites , H 1 ( x ) satisﬁes the self - consistent equation H 1 ( x ) = 1 − q + qxG 1 ( H 1 ( x ) ) . ( 7 ) Since G 0 ( x ) is the generating function for the connectiv - ity of a site , the generating function for the probability of a site to belong to an n - site cluster is H 0 ( x ) = 1 − q + qxG 0 ( H 1 ( x ) ) . ( 8 ) H 0 ( 1 ) is the probability that a site belongs to a cluster of any ﬁnite size . Thus , below the percolation transition H 0 ( 1 ) = 1 , while above the transition there is a ﬁnite probability that a site belongs to the inﬁnite spanning cluster : P ∞ = 1 − H 0 ( 1 ) . It follows that P ∞ ( q ) = q ( 1 − ∞ X k = 0 P ( k ) u k ) , ( 9 ) where u ≡ H 1 ( 1 ) is the smallest positive root of u = 1 − q + q h k i ∞ X k = 0 kP ( k ) u k − 1 . ( 10 ) This equation can be solved numerically and the solu - tion may be substituted into Eq . ( 9 ) , yielding the size of the spanning cluster in a network of arbitrary degree distribution , at dilution q [ 4 ] . We now compute the order parameter critical expo - nent β . Near criticality the probability of belonging to the spanning cluster behaves as P ∞ ∼ ( q − q c ) β . For inﬁnite - dimensional systems ( such as a Cayley tree ) it is known that β = 1 [ 7 , 8 , 13 ] . This regular mean - ﬁeld re - sult is not always valid , however , for scale - free networks . Eq . ( 9 ) has no special behavior at q = q c ; the singular behavior comes from u . Also , at criticality P ∞ = 0 and Eq . ( 9 ) imply that u = 1 . We therefore examine Eq . ( 10 ) for u = 1 − ǫ and q = q c + δ : 1 − ǫ = 1 − q c − δ + ( q c + δ ) h k i ∞ X k = 0 kP ( k ) ( 1 − ǫ ) k − 1 . ( 11 ) The sum in ( 11 ) has the asymptotic form ∞ X k = 0 kP ( k ) u k − 1 ∼ h k i − h k ( k − 1 ) i ǫ + 1 2 h k ( k − 1 ) ( k − 2 ) i ǫ 2 + · · · + c Γ ( 2 − λ ) ǫ λ − 2 , ( 12 ) where the highest - order analytic term is O ( ǫ n ) , n = ⌊ λ − 2 ⌋ . Using this in Eq . ( 11 ) , with q c = 1 / ( κ − 1 ) = h k i / h k ( k − 1 ) i , we get h k ( k − 1 ) i 2 h k i δ = 1 2 h k ( k − 1 ) ( k − 2 ) i ǫ + · · · + c Γ ( 2 − λ ) ǫ λ − 3 . ( 13 ) The divergence of δ as λ < 3 conﬁrms the lack of a phase transition in that regime . Thus , limiting ourselves to λ > 3 , and keeping only the dominant term as ǫ → 0 , Eq . ( 13 ) implies ǫ ∼   (cid:18) h k ( k − 1 ) i 2 c h k i Γ ( 2 − λ ) (cid:19) 1 λ − 3 δ 1 λ − 3 3 < λ < 4 , 2 h k ( k − 1 ) i 2 h k ih k ( k − 1 ) ( k − 2 ) i δ λ > 4 . ( 14 ) Returning to P ∞ , Eq . ( 9 ) , we see that the singular con - tribution in ǫ is dominant only for the irrelevant range of λ < 2 . For λ > 3 , we ﬁnd P ∞ ∼ q c h k i ǫ ∼ ( q − q c ) β . Comparing this to ( 14 ) we ﬁnally obtain β = (cid:26) 1 λ − 3 3 < λ < 4 , 1 λ > 4 . ( 15 ) We see that the order parameter exponent β attains its usual mean - ﬁeld value only for λ > 4 . Moreover , for λ < 4 the percolation transition is higher than 2nd - order : for 3 + 1 n − 1 < λ < 3 + 1 n − 2 the transition is of the n th - order . The result ( 15 ) has been reported before in [ 6 ] , and also found independently in a diﬀerent but related model of virus spreading [ 14 , 15 ] . The existence of an inﬁnite - order phase transition at λ = 3 for growing net - works of the Albert - Barab´asi model , has been reported elsewhere [ 16 , 17 ] . These examples suggest that the criti - cal exponents are not model - dependent but depend only on λ . For networks with λ < 3 the transition still exists , though at a vanishing threshold , q c = 0 . The sum in Eq . ( 11 ) becomes : ∞ X k = 0 kP ( k ) u k − 1 ∼ h k i + c Γ ( 2 − λ ) ǫ λ − 2 . ( 16 ) Using this in conjunction with Eq . ( 10 ) , and remember - ing that here q c = 0 and therefore q = δ , leads to ǫ = (cid:16) − c Γ ( 2 − λ ) h k i (cid:17) 13 − λ δ 13 − λ , ( 17 ) which implies 2 β = 1 3 − λ , 2 < λ < 3 . ( 18 ) In other words , the transition in 2 < λ < 3 is a mirror image of the transition in 3 < λ < 4 . An important dif - ference is that q c = 0 is not λ - dependent in 2 < λ < 3 , and the amplitude of P ∞ diverges as λ → 2 ( but remains ﬁnite as λ → 4 ) . In [ 12 ] it was shown that for a random graph of ar - bitrary degree distribution the ﬁnite clusters follow the usual scaling form : n s ∼ s − τ e − s / s ∗ . ( 19 ) Here s is the cluster size , and n s is the number of clus - ters of size s . At criticality s ∗ ∼ | q − q c | − σ diverges and the tail of the distribution behaves as a power law . We now derive the exponent τ . The probability that a site belongs to an s - cluster is p s = sn s ∼ s 1 − τ , and is gener - ated by H 0 : H 0 ( x ) = X p s x s . ( 20 ) The singular behavior of H 0 ( x ) stems from H 1 ( x ) , as can be seen from Eq . ( 8 ) . H 1 ( x ) itself can be expanded from Eq . ( 7 ) , by using the asymptotic form ( 12 ) of G 1 . We let x = 1 − ǫ , as before , but work at the critical point , q = q c . With the notation φ ( ǫ ) = 1 − H 1 ( 1 − ǫ ) , we ﬁnally get ( note that at criticality H 1 ( 1 ) = 1 ) : − φ = − q c + ( 1 − ǫ ) q c [ 1 − φ q c + h k ( k − 1 ) ( k − 2 ) i 2 h k i φ 2 + · · · + c Γ ( 2 − λ ) h k i φ λ − 2 ] . ( 21 ) From this relation we extract the singular behavior of H 0 : φ ∼ ǫ y . Then , using Tauberian theorems [ 18 ] it follows that p s ∼ s − 1 − y , hence τ = 2 + y . For λ > 4 the term proportional to φ λ − 2 in ( 21 ) may be neglected . The linear term ǫφ may be neglected as well , due to the factor ǫ . This leads to φ ∼ ǫ 1 / 2 and to the usual mean - ﬁeld result τ = 5 2 , λ > 4 . ( 22 ) For λ < 4 , the terms proportional to ǫφ , φ 2 may be ne - glected , leading to φ ∼ ǫ 1 / ( λ − 2 ) and τ = 2 + 1 λ − 2 = 2 λ − 3 λ − 2 , 2 < λ < 4 . ( 23 ) Note that for 2 < λ < 3 the percolation threshold is strictly q c = 0 . In that case we work at q = δ small but ﬁxed , taking the limit δ → 0 at the very end [ 19 ] . For growing networks of the Albert - Barab´asi model with λ = 3 , it has been shown that sn s ∝ ( s ln s ) − 2 [ 17 ] . This is consistent with τ = 3 plus a logarithmic correction . Related results for scale free trees have been presented in [ 20 ] . The critical exponent σ , for the cutoﬀ cluster size , may be too derived directly . Finite - size scaling arguments pre - dict [ 7 ] that q c ( ∞ ) − q c ( N ) ∼ N − 1 dν = N − στ − 1 , ( 24 ) where N is the number of sites in the network , ν is the correlation length critical exponent : ξ ∼ ( q − q c ) − ν , and d is the dimensionality of the embedding space . Using a continuous approximation of the distribution ( 1 ) one obtains [ 5 ] κ ≈ (cid:18) 2 − λ 3 − λ (cid:19) K 3 − λ − m 3 − λ K 2 − λ − m 2 − λ , ( 25 ) where K ∼ N 1 / ( λ − 1 ) is the largest site connectivity of the network . For 3 < λ < 4 , this and Eq . ( 4 ) yield q c ( ∞ ) − q c ( N ) ∼ ∆ κ ∼ K 3 − λ ∼ N 3 − λ λ − 1 , ( 26 ) which in conjunction with Eq . ( 24 ) leads to σ = λ − 3 λ − 2 , 3 < λ < 4 . ( 27 ) For λ > 4 we recover the regular mean - ﬁeld result σ = 1 / 2 . Note that Eqs . ( 24 ) , ( 15 ) , ( 23 ) are consistent with the known scaling relation : σβ = τ − 2 [ 7 , 8 , 13 ] . For 2 < λ < 3 , q c ( ∞ ) = 0 and q c ( N ) ∼ K λ − 3 ∼ N ( λ − 3 ) / ( λ − 1 ) . Therefore σ = 3 − λ λ − 2 , 2 < λ < 3 , ( 28 ) again consistent with the scaling relation σβ = τ − 2 ( cf Eq . ( 18 ) ) . Through similar scaling relations , any two of the perco - lation exponents discussed above determine the remain - ing ( static ) percolation exponents . Thus , for example , the exponent γ , governing the average size of ﬁnite clus - ters : h s i ∼ ( q − q c ) − γ , follows from the scaling relation γ = ( 3 − τ ) / σ . In view of Eqs . ( 23 ) , ( 27 ) , ( 28 ) , we get γ = n 1 λ > 3 , − 1 2 < λ < 3 . ( 29 ) The negative value of γ in the range 2 < λ < 3 is , at ﬁrst sight , surprising . However , recall that for that range only the percolating phase exists . At the transi - tion point , q c = 0 , all clusters have size zero . As q in - creases , ﬁnite - size clusters begin to show , consistent with h s i ∼ ( q − q c ) − γ ∼ q . In summary , we have shown that percolation critical exponents in scale - free networks bear a strong depen - dence upon the degree distribution exponent λ . This is true even in the range 3 < λ < 4 , where the percola - tion transition occurs at a ﬁnite threshold q c : the regular mean - ﬁeld behavior of percolation in inﬁnite dimensions is recovered only for λ > 4 . Moreover , critical exponents 3 are well deﬁned also in the most physically relevant re - gion of 2 < λ < 3 ( the case of most naturally occurring networks ) , despite the lack of a non - percolating phase . In this regime too the critical exponents depend strongly on λ . An interesting exception is the exponent γ , which at - tains constant values independent of λ , Eq . ( 29 ) . This suggests some underlying deeper principle which we were not yet able to uncover .

[ 11 ] It follows that for scale - free networks with m = 1 a span - ning cluster exists , even before dilution , only for λ smaller than a certain critical threshold λ c ( λ c ≈ 3 . 5 if the dis - tribution ( 1 ) is discrete , and λ c = 4 if it is continuous ) .
