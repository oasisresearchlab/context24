However , the mechanism by which MGA _ 0676 induces apoptosis has remained unclear . In this study , we evaluated MGA _ 0676 - induced apoptosis and internalization in immortalized chicken embryo ﬁbroblasts ( DF - 1 ) and cancer cell lines . The internalization of MGA _ 0676 was proven through caveolin - mediated endocytosis by blocking the endocytosis with speciﬁc inhibitors or with siRNA . We identiﬁed the Thif domain of NEDD8 - activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit ( NAE ) in DF - 1 as the target region interacting with the SNC domain of MGA _ 0676 . The interaction between the Thif and SNC domains was observed co - located in the perinuclear and nuclear of DF - 1 . We found that the interaction between NAE and MGA _ 0676 increased the ability of apoptosis and accelerated the process of cullin neddylation in DF - 1 cells , in turn activating NF - κ B . This resulted in the observed aggregation of NF - κ B in the nuclei of DF - 1 cells . Moreover , the apoptosis induced by MGA _ 0676 decreased signiﬁcantly when NF - κ B was inhibited by siRNA or BAY 11 - 7082 or when NAE was silenced by siRNA . Overall , our results demonstrate that MGA _ 0676 is internalized through caveolin - mediated endocytosis , interacts with SNC - dependent Thif to accelerate the process of cullin neddylation and activates NF - κ B in DF - 1 cells , ultimately playing a key role in apoptosis in chicken cells . Our results indicate MGA _ 0676 constitutes a critical etiological virulence factor of the respiratory disease caused by M . gallisepticum . This study also opens a venue to investigate MGA _ 0676 as a potential candidate as pro - apoptotic drug in cancer studies . Keywords : mycoplasmal nuclease MGA _ 0676 , apoptosis , endocytosis , NEDD8 - activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit , activation of NF - κ B INTRODUCTION Microbes have been reported to mediate pathogenicity in host cells by utilizing their virulence proteins ( Fitzgerald et al . , 2006 ; Humphrys et al . , 2013 ; Krachler and Orth , 2013 ) . Many of these virulence - associated proteins have also been found to play a signiﬁcant role in cytotoxicity through their interaction with host cell proteins ( Casadevall and Pirofski , 2001 ; Sourjik and Berg , 2004 ; Chen et al . , 2011 ) . Previous reports have shown that proteins of microbes with nuclease activity Li et al . Apoptosis Mechanism of Mycoplasmal Nuclease are cytotoxic to host cells , and are directly related to their pathogenicity ( Pediaditakis et al . , 2012 ; Milner et al . , 2014 ; Sacco et al . , 2014 ) . Nucleases are expressed by many diﬀerent pathogenic microbes and have been shown to play a role in creating favorable nutrient - rich environments ( Cuatrecasas et al . , 1967 ; Ma and Goodridge , 1992 ; Suh and Benedik , 1997 ) . Recently , it has been demonstrated that many pathogenic microbes possess diverse nucleases with biological functions related to the metabolism of nitrogen , phosphate and carbohydrates , as well as their survival and virulence ( Suciu and Inouye , 1996 ; Dominski , 2007 ; Lennon , 2007 ) . Other studies have indicated that microbial nucleases degrade neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs ) and evade the host cell innate immune responses ( Papayannopoulos and Zychlinsky , 2009 ; Thammavongsa et al . , 2013 ; Toid , 2014 ) . Furthermore , some bacteria possess more than one kind of nucleases , which are vital to virulence and contribute to a wide variety of cellular biological processes , such as inducing host cell death , repairing DNA damage , and evading immune clearance from host tissues ( Rottem , 2003 ; Amundsen et al . , 2008 ; Delaney et al . , 2012 ; Derré - Bobillot et al . , 2013 ; Shields et al . , 2013 ) . Due to their extremely limited biosynthetic capabilities , Mycoplasma adopts a parasitic lifestyle in order to obtain their nutritional needs from host cells ( Chung et al . , 2010 ; Fan et al . , 2010 ; Großhennig et al . , 2013 ) . Without the ability to synthesize de novo purine and pyrimidine bases , Mycoplasma has to salvage nucleotide bases to produce nucleotide precursors ( Wanga et al . , 2014 ) . However , these salvage pathways result in a series of pathological cellular processes , such as inﬂammation and apoptosis ( Razin , 1999 ; Nakhyung , 2009 ) . Numerous intracellular , extracellular and , particularly , membrane - associated nucleases have been reported in diﬀerent Mycoplasma species , many of which are implicated in host pathogenicity and cytotoxicity through the degradation of nucleotides and induction of apoptosis - like cell death ( Pollack and Hoﬀmann , 1982 ; Minion et al . , 1993 ; Paddenberg et al . , 1998 ) . Some membrane - associated nucleases have been shown to have a SNC region and able to translocate into cells , a process followed by cytotoxic eﬀects and induction of apoptosis , such as MPN133 in M . pneumoniae , mhp379 in M . hyopneumoniae , and MG186 in M . genitalium ( Schmidt et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2010 ; Somarajan et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , it is worthwhile to examine the biological properties and mechanisms of mycoplasmal membrane - associated nucleases . Previously , we found that M . gallisepticum MGA _ 0676 was a Ca 2 + - dependent cytotoxic nuclease containing a SNC region similar to other mycoplasmal nucleases , which could translocate into chicken cells and induce apoptosis in a SNC - dependent manner ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) . However , the mechanism by which MGA _ 0676 induced apoptosis remained unclear . Nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - κ B ) is a very important molecule associated with many signaling pathways , but few studies have been made to investigate the relationship between NF - κ B and apoptosis . To evaluate these mechanisms , in the present study we show that MGA _ 0676 internalizes through caveolin - mediated endocytosis , interacts with Thif - dependent SNC , accelerating the process of cullin neddylation and activating NF - κ B in DF - 1 cells , ultimately inducing apoptosis . In addition , we also show that MGA _ 0676 may be an important etiological virulence factor of the respiratory disease caused by M . gallisepticum , and that it may be involved in the immunosuppression of the infected birds .

DF - 1 cells were treated with rMGA _ 0676 ( 40 µ g / ml ) or rMGA _ 0676 1 SNC ( 40 µ g / ml ) for 24 h as described above to determine whether NF - κ B is activated via interaction of MGA _ 0676 and NAE . DF - 1 cells with silenced NAE were also treated with rMGA _ 0676 ( 40 µ g / ml ) , and NC ( unrelated RNA oligo ) was used as negative control . The samples were analyzed as described above . Detection of Activation of Cullin Neddylation in DF - 1 Cells To detect activation of cullin neddylation , DF - 1 cells were seeded on six - well plates and cultured for 24 h , then treated with rMGA _ 0676 at concentrations of 0 , 20 , 40 , or 80 µ g / ml for 24 h . Then cell lysates were prepared for western blot to detect the expression of cull - NEDD8 based on the anti - chicken cull antibody or anti - NEDD8 antibody . β - actin was used as internal TABLE 1 | Proteins present in two speciﬁc bands were observed in the GST and GFP lanes as identiﬁed by MS .

Then cell lysates were prepared for western blot to detect expression of cull - NEDD8 and NF - κ B activity as described above . β - actin was used as internal reference . Statistical Analysis All the tests were triplicated , and the statistical diﬀerences between treated and control groups were determined and analyzed by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) using SPSS software , version 18 . 0 ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) , and the graphs were made using GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 . “ns” represented no signiﬁcant diﬀerences ( P > 0 . 05 ) . “ ∗ ” represented statistically diﬀerences ( P < 0 . 05 ) , “ ∗∗ ” represented statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences ( P < 0 . 01 ) , “ ∗∗∗ ” represented statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences ( P < 0 . 001 ) . RESULTS Caveolin - Mediated Endocytic Mechanisms Are Implicated in Internalization of rMGA _ 0676 Internalization of rMGA _ 0676 was determined by incubating chicken embryo ﬁbroblasts ( DF - 1 cells ) with diﬀerent doses of recombinant nuclease at 37 ◦ C for 24 h . Initial determinations of the mechanism and internalization rates were shown in Figure S1 . Internalization of rMGA _ 0676 by DF - 1 cells increased with nuclease concentrations ( Figure S1A ) . Internalization rates were also determined by incubating DF - 1 cells with rMGA _ 0676 ( 40 µ g / ml ) at diﬀerent times , and were found to increase with incubation times ( Figure S1B ) . Bacterial toxins are endocytosed through caveolin - mediated or clathrin - dependent mechanisms . For instance , ﬁlipin can prevent caveolae vesicle formation while monodansylcadaverine ( MDC ) can inhibit clathrin - dependent vacuole formations ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ; Rejman et al . , 2004 ; Veiga and Cossart , 2006 ; Kamashev et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we pretreated DF - 1 cells with both ﬁlipin and MDC , and found that the internalization of rMGA _ 0676 was suppressed in a dose - dependent manner in cells pretreated with ﬁlipin ( Figure S2A , Figures 1A , B ) , but pretreatment with MDC did not change the internalization of rMGA _ 0676 ( Figures 1C , D ) . SiRNA technology was also employed to verify the above results . Figure S2C shows a reduction of caveolin in DF - 1 cells treated with siRNA and a signiﬁcant inhibition of the internalization of rMGA _ 0676 ( Figure S2B ) . Inhibition of internalization can also be observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Figures 1E , F ) , from which rMGA _ 0676 and caveolin were found to be co - localizing in DF - 1 cells ( Figure 1I ) . The above results indicate that caveolin - mediated endocytosis is a dominant pathway for rMGA _ 0676 internalization . Clathrin was also silenced with siRNA , but no obvious eﬀect on the internalization of rMGA _ 0676 was observed ( Figures 1G , H ) .

Apoptosis Mechanism of Mycoplasmal Nuclease MGA _ 0676 Interacts With NEDD8 - Activating Enzyme ( NAE ) In order to determine the target proteins of MGA _ 0676 , GST fusion MGA _ 0676 protein was expressed and puriﬁed from recombinant E . coli ( Figure S3A ) , and used as bait in the pull down system to screen proteins from DF - 1 cells . Two proteins ( a and b ) were selected as candidate target proteins ( Figure 2A ) . GFP - MGA _ 0676 expressed in DF - 1 cells was also used to screen proteins from DF - 1 cells by pull down , and three proteins ( c , d , and e ) were selected as candidate target proteins ( Figure 2B ) . Mass spectrometry sequencing ( MS ) results of the above ﬁve proteins showed that NEDD8 activity enzyme E1 ( NAE ) chain B ( structure Appbp1 - Uba3 - Nedd8 - Mgatp - Ubc12 ) had the highest MS sequencing score , which is the most likely target protein interacting with MGA _ 0676 ( Table 1 ) . In order to test the potential interaction , a model of the MGA _ 0676 - NAE complex was constructed , analysis of the structure prediction models suggested that MGA _ 0676 could perfectly interact with NAE , and that the interacting domain should be located at the C - terminal of MGA _ 0676 and the N - terminal of NAE ( Figure 2C ) . Furthermore , plasmids expressing HA - MGA _ 0676 or Myc - NAE were constructed to analyze their interactions within mammalian and chicken cells . When lysates of HEK293 T cells expressing both HA - MGA _ 0676 and Myc - NAE were immunoprecipitated with HA monoclonal antibody , Myc - NAE was detected in the precipitate , which indicates that MGA _ 0676 interacts with NAE ectopically expressed in mammalian cells ( Figure 2D ) . Similar results were obtained in chicken DF - 1 cells ( Figure 2E ) , indicating that the interaction between the two proteins is not cell type speciﬁc . To conﬁrm the interaction between the protein and host cells , DF - 1 cells were transfected with pCMV - HA - MGA _ 0676 expression plasmid and an immunoprecipitation assay was performed with anti - HA monoclonal antibody . NAE FIGURE 3 | Co - localization of MGA _ 0676 with NAE in the perinuclear and nuclear regions of cells . HEK293T cells ( A – D ) or DF - 1 cells ( E – G ) were co - transfected with pCMV - HA - MGA _ 0676 and pCMV - Myc - NAE . Twenty - four hours after transfection , cells underwent IFA based on anti - HA or anti - Myc antibodies . MGA _ 0676 was stained with FITC - conjugated goat anti mouse IgG antibody ( green ) , NAE was stained with rhodamine ( TRITC ) - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibody ( red ) , and cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI ( blue ) . Cell samples were observed with a laser confocal scanning microscope . Co - localization of MGA _ 0676 with endogenous NA , DF - 1 cells were transfected with pCMV - HA - MGA _ 0676 plasmid ( I – L ) or incubated with rMGA _ 0676 ( M – P ) . Twenty - four hours after treatment , cells underwent IFA based on anti - HA or anti - NAE antibodies ; cell samples were observed with a laser confocal scanning microscope .

Apoptosis Mechanism of Mycoplasmal Nuclease was detected in the lysate of HA - MGA _ 0676 - expressing cells after immunoprecipitation with anti - HA antibody ( Figure 2F ) , which indicates that MGA _ 0676 interacts with endogenous NAE . DF - 1 cells were then treated with M . gallisepticum BJ44T , lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti - MGA _ 0676 monoclonal antibody , and the precipitate was blotted with anti - NAE antibody . Both MGA _ 0676 and NAE were found in the precipitate ( Figure 2G ) , indicating that M . gallisepticum MGA _ 0676 also interacted with endogenous NAE in host cells . Furthermore , the interaction between MGA _ 0676 and NAE was observed in HEK293T and DF - 1 cells expressing HA - MGA _ 0676 and Myc - NAE by confocal microscopy , which shows HA - MGA _ 0676 and Myc - NAE co - localize in the perinuclear and nuclear regions of cells ( Figures 3A – H ) . To determine whether endogenous NAE co - localizes in the same cellular compartment , DF - 1 cells were transfected to express HA - MGA _ 0676 or treated with rMGA _ 0676 , and a similar co - localization between HA - MGA _ 0676 and NAE was found ( Figures 3I – P ) . DF - 1 cells were also treated with M . gallisepticum and IFA was done using anti - MGA _ 0676 and anti - NAE antibodies . As expected , endogenous NAE also co - localizes with MGA _ 0676 in M . gallisepticum - infected cells ( Figures 3Q – T ) . The SNC Region of MGA _ 0676 Interacts With the Thif Region of NAE To determine the region of MGA _ 0676 that interacts with NAE , a HA tag fused MGA _ 0676 mutant ( MGA _ 0676 1 SNC ) was constructed with a deleted SNC region that located at 92 to 221 amino acids of MGA _ 0676 . The MGA _ 0676 1 SNC derivative was expressed in HEK293T cells , and immunoprecipitation results indicated that MGA _ 0676 1 SNC lost the ability to interact with NAE ( Figure 4A ) . To determine the region of NAE that interacts with MGA _ 0676 , a Myc tag fused NAE mutant ( NAE 1 Thif ) was constructed with a deleted Thif region that located at 29 to 166 amino acids of NAE . Immunoprecipitation results showed that the Thif region of NAE is necessary to interact with MGA _ 0676 ( Figure 4B ) . The above results indicate that the SNC region of MGA _ 0676 interacts with the Thif region of NAE . MGA _ 0676 Interacts With NAE to Induce Apoptosis in DF - 1 Cells The binding of MGA _ 0676 to NAE suggests that NAE plays an important role in MGA _ 0676 - induced apoptosis . When NAE of DF - 1 cells was silenced via siRNA ( Figure 5A ) , rMGA _ 0676 or M . gallisepticum did not induce obvious morphological changes FIGURE 4 | The SNC region of MGA _ 0676 interacts with the Thif region of NAE .

The cell samples were observed with a laser confocal scanning microscope .

After twenty - four hours , cell lysates were prepared to detect the expression levels of Rela , IKB α , and p - IkB α in the cells . PCNA was used as the nucleus internal control and β - actin was used as the cytoplasm internal control . ( D ) NF - κ B was not activated by MGA _ 0676 in DF - 1 cells after knockdown of NAE . DF - 1 cells were pretreated with siRNA and then treated with rMGA _ 0676 . Cells treated with PBS , NC , and siRNA were used as negative control ; cells treated with rMGA _ 0676 or TNF - α were used as positive control . After 24h , Rela , I κ B α , and p - I κ B α were detected in the cells as described above . ( E ) Rela was not translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in DF - 1 cells after disruption of the interaction between MGA _ 0676 and NAE . DF - 1 cells were subjected to IFA as described in Materials and Methods . ( a – c ) cells treated with PBS were used as negative control ; ( d – f ) cells treated with TNF - α were used as positive control ; ( g – i ) cells were treated with rMGA _ 0676 ; ( j – l ) cells were treated with rMGA _ 0676 1 SNC : ( m – o ) cells were pretreated with siRNA ( negative control ) and then treated with rMGA _ 0676 ; ( p – r ) cells were pretreated with siRNA NAE and then treated with rMGA _ 0676 . ( Figure 5B ) , rMGA _ 0676 did not induce observable apoptosis ( Figure 5C ) , and the apoptosis of M . gallisepticum - infected cells decreased signiﬁcantly ( Figure 5D ) . The results of these experiments suggest that the interaction of NAE and MGA _ 0676 is related to the apoptosis of DF - 1 cells induced by MGA _ 0676 . Nuclear Factor kappa B ( NF - κ B ) Is Activated via Interaction of MGA _ 0676 With NAE The activity of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - κ B ) was examined by immunoblotting and laser scanning confocal microscopy to explore the biological eﬀects of the interactions between MGA _ 0676 and NAE . Levels of NF - κ B in the nucleus and of p - I κ B α in the cytoplasm increased while I κ B α in the cytoplasm decreased signiﬁcantly after DF - 1 cells were treated with rMGA _ 0676 ( Figure 6A ) . In addition , Rela ( p65 in mammalian cells ) translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in DF - 1 cells treated with rMGA _ 0676 or TNF - α , as shown in Figure 6B . Furthermore , NF - κ B was not activated in DF - 1 cells treated with MGA _ 0676 1 SNC ( Figure 6C ) or with MGA _ 0676 after knockdown of NAE ( Figure 6D ) . Laser scanning confocal microscopy conﬁrmed that NF - κ B lost the ability to translocate Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 10 April 2018 | Volume 8 | Article 105 Li et al . Apoptosis Mechanism of Mycoplasmal Nuclease to the nucleus in DF - 1 cells treated with MGA _ 0676 1 SNC and in rMGA _ 0676 - treated DF - 1 cells that had undergone NAE - knockdown ( Figure 6E ) . The above results indicate that MGA _ 0676 activates NF - κ B via interaction with NAE . MGA _ 0676 Activates NF - κ B Through Acceleration of Cullin Neddylation of DF - 1 Cells To explore the inﬂuence of cullin neddylation of DF - 1 after treatment with MGA _ 0676 , the cullin - NEDD8 complex of DF - 1 cells was detected by western blot . As seen in Figure 7A , compared with the PBS treated DF - 1 cells , expression of cullin - NEDD8 clearly increased in MGA _ 0676 treated DF - 1 cells , which indicated that cullin neddylation of DF - 1 was activated by MGA _ 0676 . However , we also have shown above that MGA _ 0676 could activate NF - κ B in DF - 1 cells ( Figure 6 ) . For this reason , to investigate the possible interaction between neddylation and NF - κ B in DF - 1 cells after treatment with MGA _ 0676 , we inhibited neddylation in DF - 1 cells using a speciﬁc inhibitor , MLN4924 . We found that neddylation speciﬁc inhibitor MLN4924 blocked the activation of NF - κ B induced by MGA _ 0676 ( Figure 7B ) , for further conﬁrming this results , we observed the translocation of Rela in DF - 1 cells by confocal microscopy , from the Figure 7C , we found that MGA _ 0676 lost its ability of inducing NF - κ B translocated into nucleus when the DF - 1 was pretreated with MLN4924 . All these results demonstrated that MGA _ 0676 activated NF - κ B through acceleration of cullin neddylation in DF - 1 cells . MGA _ 0676 Induces Apoptosis of Chicken Embryo Fibroblast by Activating NF - κ B Since we observed that the interaction between MGA _ 0676 and NAE activated NF - κ B and was related to the apoptosis in DF - 1 cells , we suspected NF - κ B could play an important role during the apoptosis induced by MGA _ 0676 . Therefore , in a subsequent experiment , we inhibited NF - κ B with BAY 11 - 7082 ( an inhibitor of NF - κ B ) and the apoptosis of DF - 1 cells induced by MGA _ 0676 was examined . Figure 8AI and Figure S4 showed that the cell death phenotype treated with rMGA _ 0676 was signiﬁcantly reduced by the addition of BAY 11 - 7082 ( d and e ) . The key molecule of apoptosis cleaved caspase 3 was detected in apoptosis - induced group by western blot assays ( Figure 8AII ; d and f ) , and anti - cleaved caspase 3 antibodies and HRP - conjugated goat - anti - rabbit antibodies were used as primary and secondary antibodies , and the procedure was as described in “Material and Methods” . NF - κ B was eﬀectively silenced by siRNA ( Figure 8B ) , and the apoptosis induced by rMGA _ 0676 decreased accordingly as shown by ﬂow cytometry using PI staining ( Figure 8CI , Figure S5 ) , and cleaved caspase 3 was also detected in apoptosis - induced group ( Figure 8CII ; e , f , and h ) . These data strongly suggest that MGA _ 0676 induces apoptosis by activating NF - κ B in DF - 1 cells . FIGURE 7 | MGA _ 0676 activates NF - κ B through accelerating the process of cullin neddylation in DF - 1 cells ( A ) MGA _ 0676 accelerated the process of cullin neddylation in DF - 1 cells .

DISCUSSION Endocytosis is involved in cell signaling generally mediated by clathrin ( cytosolic protein ) or caveolin ( cholesterol - binding protein ) ( Pascual - Lucas et al . , 2014 ; Haucke , 2015 ; Garcia et al . , 2017 ) . Mycoplasma nucleases have been found to be internalized host cells through endocytosis which are relevant to the process of infection ( Schmidt et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2010 ; Somarajan et al . , 2010 ) . Among of them , rMGA _ 0676 is a nuclease with a SNC region in M . gallisepticum , which can translocate into chicken cells and induce cell apoptosis , and MGA _ 0676 plays a important role in the process of infection of M . gallisepticum ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) . In the present study , we show that endocytosis is the major process by which rMGA _ 0676 translocate into cells , and that it is mediated by caveolin ( Figure S2 , Figure 1 ) . Unlike clathrin - dependent endocytosis , caveolar endocytosis has an important function in the cellular uptake of some bacterial toxins , viruses and circulating proteins , and it is usually mediated by the cellular receptors in caveolae of the host cells ( Chaudhary et al . , 2014 ; Schmidt et al . , 2015 ) . This implies there should be receptors of MGA _ 0676 on the membrane of chicken cells worthy of being identiﬁed . Several nucleases ( MPN133 , MG _ 186 , or mhp379 , among others ) have been discovered in Mycoplasma , and all of them are membrane - associated proteins that can induce apoptosis of host cells . These nucleases are thought to contribute to the pathological damage , immune evasion , and persistent infection of the host cells ( Jones and Falkow , 1996 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2010 ; Somarajan et al . , 2010 ) . NEDD8 - activating enzyme ( NAE ) has been proposed to be an important member of the neddylation pathway in the cell cycle ( Chen et al . , 2000 ; Soucy et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , bacterial eﬀector proteins can lead to ubiquitin / NEDD8 dysfunction via glutamine deamidation and induce macrophage - speciﬁc apoptosis by arresting the activity of NAE in host cells ( Munro et al . , 2007 ; Cui et al . , 2010 ; Jubelin et al . , 2010 ) . In our study , we show that the apoptosis of DF - 1 cells induced by rMGA _ 0676 decrease signiﬁcantly after knockdown Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 12 April 2018 | Volume 8 | Article 105 Li et al . Apoptosis Mechanism of Mycoplasmal Nuclease of endogenous NAE , suggesting that NAE is a crucial factor in MGA _ 0676 - induced apoptosis . Moreover , MGA _ 0676 is found to interact with NAE by their co - location in the perinuclear and nuclear regions of DF - 1 cells ( Figures 2 , 3 ) , and the interaction happens between the SNC region of MGA _ 0676 and the Thif domain of NAE ( Figure 4 ) . The most important is the interaction of NAE and MGA _ 0676 is related to the apoptosis of DF - 1 cells induced by MGA _ 0676 ( Figure 5 ) , which indicates the neddylation pathway maybe associated with apoptosis of DF - 1 cells induced by MGA _ 0676 . NF - κ B ( nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated B cells ) is one of the ﬁrst responders to harmful cellular stimuli since it belongs to the category of “rapid - acting” primary transcription factors . The activation of NF - κ B may induce or inhibit apoptosis depending on the cell type and context of the stimulus ( Chen et al . , 2003 ; Brasier , 2006 ; Huang et al . , 2015 ) . Several mycoplasmal lipoproteins have been proven to induce apoptotic and necrotic cell death in lymphocytes and monocytes / macrophages through TLR2 - mediated signaling , which leads to activation of NF - κ B ( Into et al . , 2004 ; Wu et al . , 2008 ) , M . gallisepticum lipid associated membrane proteins through an NF - κ B dependent pathway up - regulate inﬂammatory genes in chicken tracheal epithelial cells ( Majumder et al . , 2014 ) . Similar activation of NF - κ B and induction of apoptosis are found in our studies , which implies that toll - like receptors that recognize pathogen - associated molecules may be involved in the pathogenic process of MGA _ 0676 ( Lee et al . , 2014 ; Okumura and Nizet , 2014 ) . Additional results in our study indicated that the activation of NF - κ B is dependent on the interaction between MGA _ 0676 and NAE in DF - 1 cells ( Figure 6 ) , and for this reason the exact molecular mechanism is also explored . MGA _ 0676 activated NF - κ B by accelerating the process of cullin neddylation in DF - 1 cells ( Figure 7 ) , while the activation of NF - κ B induced apoptosis of DF - 1 cells ( Figure 8 ) . These ﬁndings indicated a relevant link between neddylation and NF - κ B in chicken embryo ﬁbroblasts after treatment by MGA _ 0676 . These results were also the ﬁrst to show the apoptosis induction mechanism of mycoplasmal nuclease . In addition , our results indicated that MGA _ 0676 may be an important etiological virulence factor of the respiratory disease caused by M . gallisepticum , and that it may be involved in the immunosuppression of the infected birds . MGA _ 0676 may also participate in the evasion from the immune clearance by the host , due to its ability of inducing apoptosis , which was probably mediated through the activation of NF - κ B ( Adegboye , 1978 ; Papayannopoulos , 2014 ) . Knock - out of MGA _ 0676 or SNC region may decrease the virulence of M . gallisepticum , and the attenuated strain could be used to prepare vaccines to prevent the infection caused by M . gallisepticum in the future . In conclusion , in our study we found that the mycoplasmal nuclease MGA _ 0676 interacted with NAE and accelerated cullin neddylation , which activated the NF - κ B to induce apoptosis of chicken embryo ﬁbroblasts , but how this mechanism plays its vital role in the M . gallisepticum growth and infections remain further explored .
