In the blockchain - backed Web3 communities , known for their transparency and security , airdrop serves as a widespread incentive mechanism for allocating capital and power . However , it remains a controversy on how to justify airdrop to incentive and empower the decentralized governance . In this paper , we use ParaSwap as an example to propose a role taxonomy methodology through a data - driven study to understand the characteristic of community members and the effectiveness of airdrop . We find that users receive more rewards tend to take positive actions towards the community . We summarize several arbitrage patterns and confirm the current detection is not sufficient in screening out airdrop hunters . In conjunction with the results , we discuss from the aspects of interaction , financialization , and system design to conclude the challenges and possible research directions for decentralized communities .

As technology has evolved , communities have come to refer to more than just real people , but can also be used to represent groups of users on the Internet that share specific characteristics . With the development of blockchain technology and the popularization of decentralized applications , the emergence of the so - called Web3 has brought the communities built on this particular background into our research horizon . The anonymity of blockchain prevents us from conducting user inter - views and questionnaire research , but its unique transparent nature allows us to infer user behavior through publicly available datasets . Compared to centralized communities , decentralized communi - ties of Web3 introduce more challenges , including ways to ratio - nalize the allocation of power and resources or ensure that indi - viduals do not dictate the will of the community . The disappearing central governance reforms itself in various mechanisms of other composite appearances , such as democratic voting on community development using the governance token . A real - world example is Juno Network , published Juno Proposal 16 on March 11 𝑡ℎ , 2022 , calling the community to whether the wallet of a whale 1 should have a large chunk of its token removed , like court enforcement of property . The motivation behind this was when Juno Network rewarded its early supporters with governance token , known as an airdrop 2 , the whale obtained 2 . 5 million tokens through multiple addresses , which accounted for 9 . 6 % of the total amount and could bring a huge potential security risk to the community . The proposal is highly controversial because it marks the first strong - arm tactics of on - chain governance . It is high time for decentralized communi - ties to discuss and rethink the essence of their own creation . On the one hand , it raises the community’s concern about the ownership of on - chain assets . On the other hand , the potential harm and future development of the airdrop have been widely discussed . Unlike a community in the traditional context , a decentralized community is much looser in scope . Joining and exiting a decentral - ized community often simply means whether you are a stakeholder of a certain type of token : holding assets issued by a specific pro - tocol implies corresponding rights and obligations . The protocols , 1 Means an address that holds a large amount of capital . 2 An airdrop is an unsolicited distribution of cryptocurrency or Non Fungible Tokens ( NFTs ) , usually without conditions , to multiple wallet addresses . a r X i v : 2303 . 08457v1 [ c s . H C ] 15 M a r 2023 CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Sizheng Fan , Tian Min , Xiao Wu , and Wei Cai substantially , are the large number of automatically executed pro - grams not controlled by individuals or organizations , also called smart contracts , tasked with the responsibility of regulating the community . The regulation or resolution for the decentralized com - munity is valid only if most of its members support the decision through fungible tokens ( FTs ) or NFTs voting . These governance tokens grant their holders voting rights like a shareholder meeting of listed companies . Members and potential participants are usually motivated to contribute to the community , especially in the early stages . For example , some decentralized applications ( DApps ) , such as Uniswap , dYdX , etc . , issue airdrops to early supporters for their contributions . Some NFT projects offer whitelist quota 3 for promo - tion services . The simple logic behind this is the contribution for the privilege , which indicate that users who contribute more are more likely to be competent to the governance and should be given more voting power . However , due to the financial nature inherent in blockchain tech - nology the blockchain , as of now , all digital assets on the blockchain network can be exchanged for real - world currency by various means , which implies that from a gaming standpoint , decentralized communities in Web3 are facing a more significant challenge in terms of altruism than traditional Internet communities with open source spirit . Among the early supporters eligible for airdrop , most of them are motivated by financial profit or preferential access to tokens with governance rights in order to obtain quick cash . Many of them exploit the anonymity of blockchain , registering multiple accounts and interacting with the DApp to maximize their profits , which can not be taken as a positive factor for the long - term de - velopment , because once they acquire the tokens , exploiters tend to sell the tokens as soon as possible , consequently making a drop of the asset price . These behaviors undermine the rights and the interests of those enthusiasts who would like to hold the tokens in the long run and proactively engage in the community . To address these issues , many DApps have begun to distribute governance tokens by designing stringent filtering mechanisms where a typical example is ParaSwap 4 . It is particularly strict in selecting eligible airdrop addresses : in the past two years , around 1 . 3 million addresses have interacted with this protocol , but only 19 , 999 of them were rewarded with PSP , ParaSwap’s governance token . The rigorous filtering approach caused widespread concern across the Web3 community . Some early supporters criticized the project for being screened out while they are actual users who made a practical contribution . The distribution method is significant because of its dual implication in terms of governance power and monetary , and thus triggered intense debate on the effectiveness of airdrops . In this paper , we take ParaSwap as a representative example , trying to evaluate the Web3 community and the effectiveness of allocation principles through the analysis of eligible users’ behavior and token transaction network . We collect PSP transactions of 20 , 148 addresses between November 15 𝑡ℎ , 2021 and April 13 𝑡ℎ , 2022 , based on which we analyze their behavior before and after the airdrop event and the allocation method from the following 3 A whitelist in the NFT world is a list of people who can get early and guaranteed access to mint during a specific date . 4 ParaSwap is a decentralized middleware aggregator on the Ethereum blockchain that offers the best prices across various DEXs . two aspects . From the macro aspect , we investigate the temporal development of the network properties , based on which we also find a series of the unique structure of the interaction between token holders through component analysis by comparing the token network with the external transaction network . From the micro aspect of individual addresses , we perform unsupervised clustering on eligible airdrop addresses based on their transaction patterns . We then compare the distribution difference in terms of the amount of capital and token holding duration among different clusters . Our main contributions can be summarised as follows : • Token Network Analysis . We employ global network prop - erties , such as reciprocity , degree assortativity coefficient , and attracting components , to detect significant changes and anomalies over PSP token networks . We decompose the net - work into components and discuss it in - depth with respect to potential arbitrage behavior . • Unsupervised Clustering . We utilize an unsupervised hierar - chical clustering method to capture the behaviors of eligible airdrop addresses after receiving rewards and divide them into interpretable categories . Based on the cluster results , we reveal that the threshold differential allocation can per - form a better allocation of governance power to long - term contributors . • Evaluation on Web3 Community . As a prerequisite for ratio - nal governance and creating a healthy online community , the suitable incentive mechanism and power allocation play an irreplaceable role . We point out that huge problems persist behind the idealism of equality and democracy promoted by concepts such as the Metaverse [ 16 ] . Combined with our data findings , we discuss the pros and cons of current approaches and suggest that social experiments in blockchain and Web3 as vehicles may be instructive for real - world social research . Finally , we proposed the challenges of the community en - gagement and governance as future directions and potential improvements for the Web3 Community . 2 BACKGROUND 2 . 1 Ethereum and Smart Contract Ethereum [ 55 , 57 ] has a long history of development and was de - signed to address several limitations and challenges of the Bitcoin [ 41 ] . It provides the developers with a tightly integrated end - to - end system for building software on a hitherto unexplored compute paradigm in the mainstream : a trustful object messaging compute framework with smart contracts , which are scripts that run syn - chronously on multiple nodes of a distributed ledger without the need of an external trusted authority [ 50 , 60 ] . At the inception of Ethereum , it followed the consensus mechanism 5 of Bitcoin , called Proof - of - Work ( PoW ) , which requires network members to solve an arbitrary mathematical puzzle . As PoW has the problem of wast - ing a lot of computing power with low performance and efficiency , blockchain platforms have started to adopt more efficient models , in - cluding Proof - of - Stake ( PoS ) , Delegated Proof - of - Stake ( DPoS ) , and Proof - of - Authority ( PoA ) [ 24 ] as the technology evolves . Ethereum upgraded from the PoW to PoS on September 15 , 2022 , so - called 5 Consensus mechanism refer to methodologies used to achieve consistent , trust , and security across a decentralized computer network . Making Sense of Roles in Web3 Community from Airdrop Perspective CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany The Merge 6 , which has dramatically improved its transaction per second ( TPS ) and further facilitated the development of DApps . There are three types of addresses on Ethereum : 1 ) Externally Owned Address , so - called user address , operated by human users with private keys ; 2 ) Contract Address , namely the smart contracts , governed by the internal contract code , acting as an autonomous agent ; 3 ) Prescribed Address is a kind of special addresses with various functionalities that similar to the prescribed strings in a programming language . Judging by the identity of the party who initiates the transaction , we can divide the transaction types into two categories : external and internal . External transactions are initiated by user addresses , and they can be direct transactions between user addresses or function calls to smart contracts . Internal transactions are initiated by smart contracts that can transmit between themselves or can send tokens to users , as in the case of airdrop contracts . 2 . 2 Airdrop in Web3 Prior to delving into the topic of governance in the realm of Web3 , it is imperative to have a basic understanding of the formation process of decentralized communities . This will facilitate a clearer appreci - ation of the crucial part played by airdrops in the enhancement of community empowerment and decentralization progression . The empowerment of decentralized communities in Web3 is a gradual and long - term process . Similar to public companies , DApp start - up teams follow a defined process to publish their white paper , which outlines the total number of tokens and their allocation , as well as the timeline for distribution . Although the regulations may vary from DApp to DApp , the format tends to be standardized . The majority of DApps complete the distribution process within a few years , excluding the community vault and tokens retained by the start - up team . The method of distribution is crucial to the success of Web3 communities , as the absence of this process would render the community an incomplete and unfulfilled vision . To ensure the success and sustainability of decentralized communities , it is essential to have a well - defined and executed plan for token distribution and community empowerment . Airdrops , as a mainstream way of distributing tokens , are ini - tiated by crypto projects to offer their native tokens to current or potential users in building a decentralized community . They serve multiple purposes , being akin to virtual coupons that can be deposited directly into a wallet . These coupons serve as a way to at - tract new customers or reward existing ones . The tokens that are a part of an airdrop are usually compliant with Ethereum Request for Comments ( ERC ) 7 standards and can function as a form of currency or grant governance rights in the form of governance tokens . The distribution of airdrops is determined by the level of participation in specific events hosted by the blockchain platform , DApps , or NFT purchases . In conclusion , airdrops play a vital role in fostering the growth and involvement of decentralized communities and are , therefore , a crucial tool for any crypto project seeking to establish a thriving decentralized community . 6 https : / / ethereum . org / en / upgrades / merge / 7 ERC is a document to write smart contracts on Ethereum . They describe rules that Ethereum - based tokens must comply with . 2 . 3 ParaSwap’s Allocation Method AsmoreandmoreDAppsareusingairdropstorewardearlyadopterswithincreasinglylargeamountsofmoney , a breed of people known as " Airdrop Hunters " , who create multiple wallet addresses and inter - act with the protocol to obtain multiple airdrops [ 35 ] . Their actions will hinder the decentralization of the protocol . To cope with this situation , DApps are constantly optimizing and adjusting their al - location policies . As shown in Figure 1 , from fair allocation led by Uniswap in the very beginning , to differential allocation trend formed by dYdX 8 , to threshold differential allocation represented by ParaSwap , the difficulty of getting airdrop is increasing . This is an important reason why we choose ParaSwap as the object of our study , because it is not only the representative of airdrop method at this stage , but its stringent filter is also the trend of future development . Figure 1 : Development of Airdrop To identify the hunters , ParaSwap first filtered the addresses with at least 50 transactions on the respective networks or have a minimum native token balance 9 . Different from existing rules , ParaSwap set a threshold of having at least six times of interactions in the last six months . Besides , ParaSwap leveraged the common patterns between hunters since they usually make external trans - actions between their accounts , which could filter addresses which were a part of a clique with size > 5 . User will be graded with their level of activity to determine the reward tier 10 . 3 RELATED WORK 3 . 1 Governance in Online Communities Millions of communities gather in online spaces such as Twitter , Reddit , Discord , and so on , which fill an essential part of our daily lives and continue to shape an interconnected social scene differ - ently than ever before . However , behind the prosperity of online communities , issues such as disinformation , sexual harassment , inflammatory and hate speech remain . Therefore , regulations are urgently needed and play an irreplaceable role in community gov - ernance . Today , community governance is mainly in the form of a centralized model consisting of roles and permissions , where groups such as administrators and moderators have broad privi - leges over ordinary users . The regulators can be a specific depart - ment of service provider , user autonomy [ 12 ] , or hired personnel for content review [ 11 ] , to perform intervention or censorship such as deplatforming [ 30 ] , quarantining [ 13 ] with the help of artifi - cial intelligence and algorithms [ 29 , 47 ] . Originating from Web 2 . 0 developed nearly twenty years ago , this centralized governance 8 https : / / dydx . exchange 9 ParaSwap set the minimum token balance to 0 . 028 ETH for Ethereum , 0 . 25 BNB for BSC , 20 Matic for Polygon , and 0 . 9 AVAX for Avalanche C - Chain . 10 https : / / medium . com / paraswap / whats - an - active - user - clarifying - psp - token - distribution - filtering - logic - 81df6096d410 CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Sizheng Fan , Tian Min , Xiao Wu , and Wei Cai model is now used in software for almost all major online platforms . Researchers have conducted an extensive and in - depth study on the governance aspects of online communities . For example , Manoel et al . [ 26 ] studied the level of activity , and ideological changes , when toxic online communities on mainstream platforms faced modera - tion measures such as bans and migrated to other platforms . They showed increases in signals associated with toxicity and radical - ization , which justifies concerns that the reduction in activity may come at the expense of a more toxic and radical community . Faced with an endless chase between moderator and violator , researchers are exploring the potential of blockchain technology to facilitate community governance and democratize decision - making . By autonomously executing smart contracts , DApps can provide users with a variety of decentralized services , including crowd - funding , decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) , social networking , decen - tralized autonomous organizations ( DAOs ) , and blockchain games . They expand the possibility of governance and encode certain val - ues that make top - down , authoritarian and , punitive governance easier to implement . DApps try to achieve a complete decentral - ization and direct democracy through issuing governance token , that is , to establish a universal voting system where the direction of the project’s development is determined by the whole commu - nity . Proposals for voting can be community cooperation , using the community vault , or changing the rule of a digital game . The gov - ernance under blockchain is challenging , and it is difficult to steer a decentralized community and promote its development without sacrificing decentralization [ 17 ] . Techno - determinism seems more favored at the expense of the complexity of the social organization . This has partly contributed to the current chaotic public opinion on blockchain . Proponents of centralization also argue that a tra - ditional centralized authority is necessary for the current highly financialized blockchain to emphasize the role of the state [ 5 ] . Although in the very recent past , blockchain - based media plat - forms ( LBRY , CreativeChain , MediaChain , Blockphase ) emerged to provide services such as copyright protection [ 18 ] , the emphasis of decentralized community governance is much different com - pared to the mainstream Web 2 . 0 community nowadays . Due to the disparity in user volume and platform traffic , it is difficult for us to identify social platforms similar to Twitter and Facebook from Web3 and to draw a side - by - side comparison of their mechanism in content regulation . However , this does not prevent us from explor - ing the characteristics of user behavior in existing decentralized communities to pave the way for possible future emergence . 3 . 2 Study on Decentralized Communities Since the inception of blockchain technology , developers and re - searchers have never stopped trying to define or paint an ideal picture of a decentralized community , also known as DAOs , in terms of technology and social science benchmarks , but there does not have a consensus . However , a comprehensive definition made by Luis Cuende is that “a DAO is an internet - native entity with no central management which is regulated by a set of automatically enforceable rules on a public blockchain , and whose goal is to take a life of its own and incentives people to achieve a shared common mission” [ 17 ] . Lustig et al . [ 37 ] studied the sociotechnical imaginaries about how people envision the possible and desirable future of decen - tralized autonomous systems and identified three framings of au - tonomous technology as physical objects , as mathematical rules and as artificial managers , which can inform the design and governance of this novel concept . Faqir et al . [ 17 ] , from a more specific and practical perspective , review the collective governance DAO pro - viding platforms and their key features . At the same time , from the aspect of system construction , DAO - Analyzer - like evaluation sys - tems [ 4 ] that can visualize the activity and participation of DAO are also being actively developed , thanks to the open - source nature of blockchain data . At the same time , other critical and skeptical voices are helping to correct the direction of the decentralized community . Nabben et al . [ 40 ] suggested that reputation in blockchain systems could become the new algorithmic authoritarianism if misused for social control and would conversely weaken the human factor in autonomy by employing ethnographic methods . Meijer et al . [ 38 ] provide a conceptualization of the consequences of blockchain sys - tems that can imply the way of developing regulatory arrangements and strategies that strike a balance between power and possibilities that blockchain applications offer to mitigate negative effects . While other previous research focuses on the data - driven analy - sis on transaction records and token flow [ 20 , 32 , 39 ] , but only few of them concentrate on the specific topic of decentralized communities . Friedhelm Victor et al . [ 53 ] presented a descriptive measurement study to reveal the quantitative characters of the token network by providing an overview of more than 64 , 000 ERC - 20 token net - works and pointed out that even though the token network on Ethereum has followed a power law in its degree distribution , lots of individual token networks are frequently dominated by spoke pattern or a single hub . Similarly , Chen et al . [ 15 ] analyzed the whole token ecosystem on Ethereum with emphasis on the token creators and stakeholders . The result suggested that token holding and token creation are profoundly unbalanced . These studies can be based to some extent on our expectations about the distribution of governance tokens , which , as mentioned in Section 1 , are the materialization of the rights of community members . The imbal - ance in the distribution of power indicates a so - called decentralized community is substantially controlled by some minority groups of authority , which further implies deficiencies in the process of com - munity empowerment . Furthermore , airdrop , the most dominant means of power allocation , has not been widely evaluated yet . We consider our study a tentative attempt to derive the ratio - nality of the airdrop model backward from the results regarding users’ behavior after acquiring them . And more importantly , we try to set up a research pipeline of role identification to understand and conclude the users’ composition and behavioral patterns in a decentralized community . We hope this work could provide refer - able information and data - driven evidence to support the further design and research on decentralized governance models . 4 DATASET OVERVIEW As we mentioned in Section 1 , the Web3 community has very loose boundaries , i . e . , as long as having a corresponding token , anyone can be accepted as a member . For the sake of brevity and precision , in the rest of this paper , we will use Member to refer to all addresses Making Sense of Roles in Web3 Community from Airdrop Perspective CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany holding PSP tokens in general and Initial Member to represent the 13 , 830 addresses that initially qualified for and claimed the airdrop . Figure 2 : Procedure of Data Collection and Dataset Generate Inthispaper , wecollect71 , 002 transactionrecords intheParaSwap community formed by 20 , 148 members , among which there are 13 , 830 initial members . The general process of our data collection is shown in Figure 2 . Since the raw on - chain data can be understood as bank transfer records , which are low in data dimension and contain less valuable information , we spend extra effort on data augmentation and pre - processing , such as compiling transaction’s bytecode and interpreting the purpose of the function called . The dataset is formed by the behaviors of three kinds of roles : smart con - tract , initial and later members , among which the initial members are what interested us most . So , we collect the entire transaction history of these addresses , and together with the PSP token records , we generate a user profile and encode their behavioral patterns into a cluster - solvable sequence form in the following section . More - over , we set up two transaction graphs , PSP Transaction Graph and External Graph , aiming to unravel the occurrence of cliques and the relationship between nodes . 4 . 1 Behaviors after Receiving Rewards In order to explore the ParaSwap community member’s behavior after the airdrop event , we have to categorize the transactions to simplify the data . In Web3 , it is granted that operations on tokens can be traded on certain exchanges or direct transactions to an address . However , there are two operations with more financial properties that deserve more attention , namely Staking and Liq - uidity Providing ( LP ) . Staking is a kind of financial service held by DApps , which offers token holders a way of locking their assets to earn passive income without selling them . As staking tokens increases the number of locked positions , it reduces the liquidity in the market , which in turn can contribute to the stability and even appreciation of the coin price , which is positive for the members holding them . LP is also a kind of passive income and increases the value locked to stabilize the price . The tokens fill the DEXs’ liquidity pools to make it easier for other traders to exchange tokens . In sum - mary , from the community’s perception , staking and LP are more likely to be perceived as actions that benefit their interests and , to a certain extent , can be considered as a form of altruism since the members performing these actions will sacrifice the liquidity of their assets and opportunity for quick cash . Table 1 illustrates the distribution of transactions made by the initial members after the airdrop , based on three reward levels . It is noteworthy that the initial member who received 5 , 200 PSP tokens made a substantial proportion of the Sending actions , however , the corresponding receiving transactions are comparatively low , regardless of the reward category . This suggests that a significant amount of PSP tokens were transferred to subsequent new members through direct transfers . A similar trend can be observed in the Selling and Buying behavior pair of trading . Through simple calculation , we find that 103 , 745 , 200 PSP were claimed in total , from which subtract the remaining amount of PSP in initial members’ addresses , we can get there are rounding 93 , 202 , 386 PSP flowed to the market , accounting for 89 . 34 % of all . Consequently , up to the moment of data collection on April 14 𝑡ℎ , 2022 , there are 11 , 948 initial members , accounting for 86 . 39 % of all who gave away all their tokens and thus left the community . Among these people who withdrew , 3 , 282 , 4 , 885 , and 1 , 843 belong to the corresponding category of 5 , 200 , 7 , 800 , and 10 , 400 . The attrition rates for the three groups were 76 . 49 % , 71 . 46 % , and 48 . 20 % . 4 . 2 Most Popular Services We collect and organize a dictionary mapping 4 , 330 smart con - tract addresses with their names and functions to obtain a human - readable interpretation for each transaction . To explore what kinds of smart contract services have gained the most interaction in the wake of the airdrop event , we list the top ten smart contracts that received the highest number of transactions shown in Table 2 . Not surprisingly , the vast majority of the smart contracts on the list belong to the type of financial services , as tokens from airdrop have not gained universal purchasing capacity in a short period . 4 . 3 Network Construction Based on the data obtained above , we collect the information about ParaSwap members’ transaction records on Ethereum and create a token network , PSP Transaction Graph , to perform temporal analy - sis , as shown in Figure 3 . Specifically , we construct a directed graph for PSP tokens , where nodes stand for accounts and edges with weights representing transaction values . The network consists of 20 , 148 nodes and 46 , 410 edges for the PSP token transaction after the airdrop event . In addition , we are also interested in what happened before the airdrop event . Based on the full external transaction records we collected , we generate an External Graph containing 221 , 864 nodes and 1 , 111 , 209 edges for 7 , 003 , 317 external transaction history . Since an external transaction usually means a simple p2p transaction , it is not as informative as the PSP transaction graph , but it has a much larger and broader set of messages that can play an important role in exploring the connection between addresses before the airdrop . 4 . 4 Temporal Evolution of Network As shown in Figure 4 , we compute selected properties by taking the slice by the week , which means that we intercept the graph from the origin to the moment of data collection every other week , including : • a . Reciprocity : Reciprocity originates from a social psychol - ogy concept that one positive behavior is rewarded by the performance of another positive behavior , which is defined as one of the defining attributes of any community [ 56 ] .

Graph theory , refers to the likelihood of nodes in a directed network to be mutually linked . • b . Degree Assortativity Coefficient : Assortativity is em - ployed to assess whether nodes that share similar degree values tend to interconnect [ 52 ] . A positive correlation in network assortativity is observed when nodes with higher degrees tend to associate with nodes that have a comparably large degree . If nodes with greater degrees tend to link to nodes with a lower degree , the network is said to have a negative correlation . • c . NumberofAttractingComponents : Anattractingcom - ponent in a directed graph G is a strongly connected compo - nent with the property that a random walker on the graph will never leave the component once it enters the component , while the term strongly connected refers to if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex . Figure 4 : Selected Parameters of PSP Token Transaction Net - work From the reciprocity ( Figure 4 - a ) , it can be seen that at the outset , there was only a one - way distribution of rewards to participants from the airdrop address , but over time the reciprocity gradually rises . As mentioned in the sociological explanation above , the whole network of transactions and the participants’ connections in it are becoming more stable and robust . Due to the presence of exchanges , the degree assortativity coefficient ( Figure 4 - b ) of this network seems to be unsurprisingly negative , implying a high degree of cen - tralization . However , this negative value tends to decrease slightly over time , which can be explained by the fact that p2p transfers are increasing . In other words , there is an increased tendency for a node to link to another node with the same level of degree as itself . Again as the entire network began with airdrop contracts and moved from being highly centralized to relatively decentralized , the number of attracting components ( Figure 4 - c ) also decreased over time because as PSP token circulates , isolates and non - airdrop addresses continue to join the market . The growth of the node and edge in the graph shows that they both gradually increase at the beginning and stabilise over time ( Figure 4 - d ) . 5 METHOD FOR ROLE IDENTIFICATION With the advancements in artificial intelligence , deep learning has become a commonly used method to understand user behavior by analyzing their interaction data [ 44 ] . However , this approach , despite being widely applied and requiring minimal domain knowl - edge , is not very interpretable . In particular , there is a lack of clarity regarding the discovery of roles and the understanding of user be - havior within the " black box " of deep learning . For blockchain data , Making Sense of Roles in Web3 Community from Airdrop Perspective CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany predictions can be made to identify attacks or money laundering [ 19 ] , but there is currently no widely recognized training set to guide the behavioral patterns that emerge from the data - level fea - tures . As an alternative to deep learning , some studies have explored the use of unsupervised learning or principal component analysis to obtain interpretable clusters , which can be used to more effectively capture and analyze the behavior of community members [ 1 ] . 5 . 1 Labeling Member’s Behavior For each address , we rearrange its activities into a transaction flow : a discrete sequence of events , which describes the smart contracts called by it , the number of PSP involved in the operations , and the remaining PSP in its balance after the operation . We divide the interactions between nodes into four categories : Trading , LP , Staking and Transferring . Figure 5 illustrates the formatting of a transaction flow . Figure 5 : The Process of Formatting Transaction Flow 5 . 2 Feature Extraction Our clustering algorithm is based on a similarity graph , where each node represents an address , and each edge represents a similarity weight between two addresses’ transaction flows . We identify the address behavioral clusters by partitioning the similarity graph . We extract transaction patterns from the flow as features to compare similarities . Specifically , we extract operation types of the 𝑚 𝑡ℎ address and reformulate an operation flow as a sequence 𝑆 𝑚 = { 𝑠 1 , 𝑠 2 , . . . , 𝑠 𝑞 } , where 𝑠 𝑖 is the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ operation in this sequence , and 𝑞 is the total number of items in the sequence . We use S to denote the set of all sequences and 𝑀 to represent the total number of sequences in S . However , the difference in the length of operation flows make it difficult to measure the similarity . To solve the above problem , we denote eight kinds of operations with 𝑗 as the index . After calculating and organizing the number of operation types in every address , we can obtain the features of the 𝑚 𝑡ℎ address as 𝑂 𝑚 = { 𝑐 1 , 𝑐 2 , . . . , 𝑐 8 } , where 𝑐 𝑗 equals to 1 or 0 . When it is equal to 1 , the address has done this operation . When it equals 0 , this operation has not been performed by the address . After extracting the features of addresses’ behaviors , we choose weighted cosine similarity over other alternatives ( e . g . , Euclidean distance ) because it is more suitable to handle the highly sparse matrix [ 27 ] . 𝑑 ( 𝑆 1 , 𝑆 2 ) = (cid:205) 𝑛𝑗 = 1 ( 𝜔 𝑗 𝑐 1 , 𝑗 ) × ( 𝜔 𝑗 𝑐 2 , 𝑗 ) √︃(cid:205) 𝑛𝑗 = 1 ( 𝜔 𝑗 𝑐 21 , 𝑗 ) × √︃(cid:205) 𝑛𝑗 = 1 ( 𝜔 𝑗 𝑐 22 , 𝑗 ) ( 1 ) 𝑑 ( 𝑆 1 , 𝑆 2 ) ranges from 0 to 1 , and a small distance value indicates a high similarity between two transaction flows . 𝜔 𝑗 refers to the weight of the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ feature , whose value chosen in our method is fundamental to the cluster results . 𝑛 is the number of elements in 𝑂 𝑚 , which is 8 in this case . 5 . 3 Clustering Algorithm Weemployedanagglomerativehierarchicalclustering ( AHC ) , which has less time complexity and better computational stability [ 59 ] . Specifically , AHC procedures start with 𝑚 singleton clusters and repeatedly merge clusters until a specific level of granularity has been achieved , i . e . , the number of clusters reaches the target . The AHC has three main distance measures : single linkage , complete linkage , and average linkage [ 59 ] . In most cases , the AHC with single link is relatively stable and effective for linear , manifold , and convex data . Another important issue is how to obtain the suitable partition from several clustering results , which can be characterized as the problem of determining the optimal number of clusters 𝐾 . 5 . 4 Determining the Number of Roles In our approach , the number of clusters , 𝐾 , is a free variable , and how to decide its value will be the key to the whole process . Too high or too low a value of 𝐾 will have a significant impact on the results , especially in terms of interpretability . To overcome the problem , we used the Silhouette Coefficient [ 3 ] to select the optimal 𝐾 in AHC . Specifically , we trained the data on AHC with 𝐾 ranging from 2 to 20 to determine the optimal number of clusters . We find that the AHC with 𝐾 ∈ [ 12 , 20 ] seems to be a good option in this circumstance . After calculating the transaction distribution for each cluster and comparing its differentiation from other 𝐾 value results , we find that the most suitable solution is when 𝐾 = 14 , which results in a relatively balanced number of addresses among the clusters , but at the same time maintains independence between , without fusing important and distinct characteristics . 5 . 5 Cluster Results After determining the parameter , we can proceed with the model to get the initial members’ roles in the airdrop community . The result generated 14 clusters , and the t - Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ( t - SNE ) visualization is shown in Figure 6 . In Table 3 , we label the clusters with an index and description of their proportion , source of income , and ways of consumption . It is worth noting that the algorithm captures the type of operation of the members , and the ways of consumption describe precisely their behaviors belonging to the corresponding cluster with very clear boundaries . This means that 75 . 97 % of the members performed a single type of operation after the airdrop event . Data from trans - action flow shows that most of these operations were done once , which is consistent with the context of high Ethereum commission fees . As part of the single - operation clusters , 61 . 03 % , or clusters 1 and 2 , exited the community in a short period after obtaining an CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Sizheng Fan , Tian Min , Xiao Wu , and Wei Cai Figure 6 : t - SNE Processed Visualization of Cluster Results airdrop , which is also validated and in accordance with the member attrition scenario we discussed in Section 4 . 1 . Table 3 : 14 Clusters of Members in ParaSwap Community Index Source Consumption Percentage 1 Airdrop ( Group 1 ) Selling 38 . 79 % 2 Sending 22 . 24 % 3 Staking 14 . 94 % 4 Staking + Selling 8 . 50 % 5 Holding 4 . 87 % 6 Selling + Sending 2 . 39 % 7 Staking + Sending 1 . 71 % 8 LP + Staking 0 . 39 % 9 LP + Selling 0 . 30 % 10 LP 0 . 11 % 11 LP + Sending 0 . 09 % 12 Airdrop + Buy ( Group 2 ) Staking + Sending / Selling 3 . 58 % 13 Sending / Selling 1 . 91 % 14 LP + Sending / Selling 0 . 18 % 5 . 6 Composition of Airdrop Tiers in Clusters By calculating the proportion of reward recipients at different tier levels in each cluster , we obtain Figure 7 . On the whole , addresses belonging to the 7 , 800 tier occupy a significant majority in each cluster , which is inevitable , as the number of claimants for the three - tier rewards of 5 , 200 , 7 , 800 , and 10 , 400 are , respectively , a ratio close to 3 : 5 : 2 . Taking the above factors into consideration , we can say that members with proactive token purchasing behavior are statisti - cally more likely to be involved in more permanent and substantial financial activity . Initial members with these characteristics are what DApps want to see , as their active participation in staking Figure 7 : Proportion of Airdrop Tiers in Clusters activity enhances the stability of the issued tokens . However , this segment accounts for less than 6 % of the total addresses eligible for the airdrop . How to increase the percentage of these addresses should be of interest and research to project owners . 5 . 7 Implications for Buying Behavior We define the operation of exchanging PSP from a DEX as a buying behavior , which means that these members in addition to airdrop rewards , in making the act of collecting tokens with subjective motivation . So , naturally , the research questions such as " What are the qualities of an address that has a buying behavior ? " , " How does this group of buyers differ from other groups ? " arise . Shown in Table 3 , we mark the cluster index from 1 to 11 as Group 1 , whose only source of PSP token is airdrop , and the index from 12 to 14 as Group 2 , whose performed buying behaviors . We selected three indicators : Balance , Staking , and Liquidity to discuss the distinction between the two groups in terms of duration period , and quantity held . We define the sum of the number of days that a financial activity is carried out by an address until the complete withdrawal of capital as Period , while the weighted average of the number of tokens corresponding to the duration is defined as Quantity , which in this case is of course number of PSP holding . In Figure 8 a , we fit their period distributions with probability density function ( PDF ) in order to reduce the gap between Group 1 and Group 2 in terms of the amount of data . The overall perspective of the total density distribution shows that Group 2 has a wider distribution than Group 1 . In the leftmost Balance Period , there is a relatively clear concentration at 0 and 147 on the x - axis , meaning that initial members are more likely to remove their PSP tokens on the day they receive a short or to continuously hold it until the day we made a slice to collect the data . It is worth noting that in the rightmost liquidity period distribution , the maximum duration value is just under 40 , which means that for both groups , overall , all members are not very willing to provide liquidity . In Figure 8 b , we plot the density functions for the quantity of tokens of Group 1 and Group 2 . There is a clear difference between the three subgraphs here and those above : the top graph PDF curve is smoother , while the bottom one is more serrated , which indicates that the Figure 8 b has a more discrete distribution of values , caused precisely by the fixed amount of three airdrop slots . Starting with the distribution of balances on the left , there is no doubt that Group 2 , which has " purchases " as an additional source of PSP tokens , has more members distributed over a higher quantity of tokens . As for the middle graph of staking and right graph of liquidity , Group 2 Making Sense of Roles in Web3 Community from Airdrop Perspective CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 8 : Fitted Period Distribution and PSP Token Distribution with PDF also outperformed Group 1 in both respects , with the majority of members in Group 1 having no staking or LP action at all , which results in missing data . The only samples stay low and concentrated around the origin . 5 . 8 Discussion on Role Identification Fourteen clusters are , as yet , way too many for conducting higher - level analysis and discussion . Coupled with the fact that we noticed that clusters are logically connected with each other in actions beyond the data level , we re - integrated the clusters into five roles . We next elaborate on the rationale for the reintegration and will discuss the instructive significance of the roles and classification methods in the next section . 5 . 8 . 1 Speculators ( 41 . 18 % ) : Cluster 1 , 6 . Speculators will choose to sell the airdrops through CEXs or DEXs without any other opera - tions after obtaining the airdrops rewards . The motivation behind their almost immediate withdrawal from the community was most likely purely profit - driven . Speculators may have given a return that was just able to cover their costs when they participated in the preliminary activities . Based on their judgment , selling PSP in the short term would yield the greatest return , which also implies that they hold a pessimistic attitude about the future development of the agreement . Otherwise , promising development would bring them higher expected returns . So , can we consider the presence of speculators , especially as ini - tial members , to impede the development of the Web3 community ? We suggest that the answer is no . There are plenty of speculators in whatever market , and even more so in the context of blockchain , known for its free trade . This should be treated as an immutable en - vironment precondition . Speculators are bringing in new members as they exit the community . But DApps need to be wary that once the number of speculators becomes too large and the second and third - generation members all hold this pattern of behavior , it will lead to the ponziization of the protocol and bring about a difficult reversal of the predicament [ 7 ] . 5 . 8 . 2 Diamond Holders ( 20 . 31 % ) : Cluster 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 . Diamond Hold - ers are those initial members who hold PSP until April 13 𝑡ℎ 2022 without selling or sending PSP . They are considered optimistic about the long - term development of the community in terms of the appreciation of token price , hoping to achieve greater income in the later stage . We further divide two sub - categories in Diamond Holders : • Risk - averse Holders ( 4 . 87 % ) : They are risk averse , refusing to participate in the risky activities associated with tokens , such as staking and LP , despite the potential income . • Risk - seeking Holders ( 15 . 44 % ) : Different from risk - averse holders , risk - seeking holders are keen to participate in risky activates . Diamond Holders are undoubtedly one of the most welcoming categories of community members . They are willing to give up quick cash and bear the opportunity cost 11 of holding positions and contributing their assets to the PSP price . In contrast to speculators , they have confidence and are qualified to participate in the future voting of the community for holding governance tokens . 11 The concept of opportunity cost is fundamental to the economist’s view of costs . Since resources are scarce relative to needs , the use of resources in one way prevents their use in other ways . CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Sizheng Fan , Tian Min , Xiao Wu , and Wei Cai 5 . 8 . 3 Airdrop Hunters ( 22 . 24 % ) : Cluster 2 . We suggest that the vast majority of the initial members belonging to cluster 2 should be affiliated accounts controlled by a single individual , since the risk of p2p trading with strangers is often unacceptable without smart contracts as intermediaries rather than direct transaction . We will prove this hypothesis later in Section 6 . 2 . 5 . 8 . 4 Diversified Members ( 10 . 62 % ) : Cluster 4 , 7 , 9 , 11 . Different from speculators and airdrop hunters , Diversified Members choose to take part in multiple activities . They are involved in staking and LP , but at the same time , they do send and sell . Members of this composite behavior pattern are more likely to be independent individuals , as savvy Airdrop Hunters tend to aggregate PSP in one place before staking or LP to reduce multiple commission fees . On the one hand , they pursue more returns by participating in staking and LP . On the other hand , they also sell PSP for a profit when PSP reaches a proper price . Their decision patterns are rela - tively more dynamic and flexible . In a sophisticated decentralized community , this group of members should make up the major - ity , but we only find around ten percent of them in the ParaSwap community . 5 . 8 . 5 Buyers ( 5 . 67 % ) : Cluster 12 , 13 , 14 . Also welcomed by the com - munity , but unlike Diamond Holders , Buyers are more proactive in purchasing PSP . As we mentioned in Section 5 . 7 for positive implica - tions of purchasing behavior , we classify this group independently as a role . 5 . 8 . 6 Summary . To put a summary at the end of this section , we would like to discuss the potential contribution of role identification to decentralized community governance and airdrop distribution methods as a practical guide , which can also be used as a universal methodology to understand the human engagement within other blockchain based community . We found that the differential airdrop can influence the behav - ior of initial members to a degree . Members who receive more rewards have more spare capacity to invest in positive actions for the community . We cannot conduct a profound analysis on the cost of acquiring airdrop per initial member in this paper because it involves extremely complex calculations and system design . If rewards can fill the cost of early - stage participation , members will have fewer concerns about staking and LP . A more accurate predic - tion when setting the differential regulations , designed to ensure that members do not lose money without affecting the stability of the token model , would provide a stronger incentive . On a more assertive side , the community could split the planned airdrop into multiple installments or set additional rewards . Specif - ically , the protocol can perform role identification with respect to the behavior of the address after the first few airdrops , during which they investigate the role dynamics of members , including how their role changes over the cycles and what kind of factors can preserve long - term participation in the community . The project owner can decide on the airdrop list through the above process and result . While such a policy is somewhat paternalistic , and we would like to see more spontaneous enthusiasts , on a result level , the tempting additional rewards could lead to more positive behav - ior . Community rule makers also should not have the illusion of being overly idealistic ; a profit - oriented mindset is more prevalent on anonymous and highly market - oriented blockchain platforms than in real communities [ 10 , 23 ] . 6 NETWORK ANALYSIS We try to explore the behavior of the initial members through com - ponent analysis on PSP Transaction Graph . The existence of CEXs will cause great confusion in the transaction analysis , making find - ing components extremely difficult . The exclusion of CEXs may cut down on the number of components , but could provide a more credible dataset . Hence , we focus on those components that consist entirely of direct transfers in order to obtain more accurate and credible results . Through the process of cutting off contract ad - dresses and isolates , we obtain 2 , 493 components consisting purely of 7 , 982 wallet addresses and label them with corresponding IDs . Figure 9 : Typical Structure of Chain Transaction 6 . 1 Typical Forms of Component We found a large number of records of p2p transactions in Section 5 . 4 , so how these PSP were transferred became a natural question . For 2 , 493 components with marked IDs , we recorded the number of nodes and edges as well as the edges’ weight , the number of initial and newly - generated members , and reciprocity characteristics to produce a profiling dataset . On average , each component consists of 3 . 20 nodes , and there are 586 components containing more than three . 3 , 219 out of 7 , 982 second - generation members are involved in these p2p transaction components . On average , each component contains at least 1 . 38 second - generation members , and only 35 of them do not contain any . When we plotted all the components con - taining more than three nodes , we noticed some special structures that frequently appeared and immediately associated them with potential arbitrage behavior . We named the two typical structures as Chain and Sunflower according to their propagation method . We use different node colors of Orange to represent initial members and Sky Blue to represent later members . In order to have a better visual perception of a white background , we use the cool colormap array 12 , which changes its color from blue to purple as the edge weight increases . As shown in Figure 9 , we find two special paths of one - way token transfer among components , which we call the " Chain " transaction . The pattern starts from one or multiple initial members and contin - uously propagates the PSP it received to its successors . As shown in the subgraph on the left of Figure 9 , in the component ID - 831 , eight nodes of initial members pass their tokens to a second - generation member . The edge color between the nodes is from shallow to deep , 12 https : / / www . mathworks . com / help / matlab / ref / cool . html Making Sense of Roles in Web3 Community from Airdrop Perspective CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany representing the increasing number of PSP passed like a Fibonacci series . The other one - way pass structure of ID - 3 has more of a merging and splitting pattern , as shown on the right . Figure 10 : Typical Structure of Sunflower Transaction Another transmitting pattern we called " Sunflower " is shown in Figure 10 . The PSP obtained from the initial members is transferred to an eligible address , which performs a single operation on the PSP . The difference between these two approaches is that the initial central member in the right - hand side of Figure 10 acts as a transit vertex to transfer the collected PSP to another newly - generated member . Figure 11 : Alternative Structure of Sunflower Transaction The two patterns shown in Figure 11 also aggregate PSP to a sin - gle node . But unlike the " Sunflower " transaction , the central nodes are non - airdrop nodes . We dig into the transaction history of these central nodes and notice that they have no record of interaction with any smart contract but only serve as a staging area , which pre - vents the airdrop nodes from directly interacting with each other in order to ensure the independence between them . If without a network - wide screening of transactions , it would be difficult for the DApps to exclude such components . Admittedly , discovering these components based on the PSP token network while proving the existence of potential arbitrage is a kind of hindsight . DApps would undoubtedly like to have dis - covered these possible arbitrage behaviors before the airdrop event . However , this does not diminish the contribution of this section . First of all , the emergence of this sort of aggregation patterns has demonstrated the vulnerability of the ParaSwap community’s mech - anism for filtering hunters . A component with a more significant number of members , such as ID - 100 , is capable of holding 130 , 000 PSP in a single individual and has more than 20 times the voting power of the average member . In addition , we demonstrate that component analysis remains essential even after the airdrop event , giving the community a way to track down potential hunters or Sybil attackers and eliminate the risk before they cause significant damage . Figure 12 : Clique ID - 309 6 . 2 Airdrop Hunter Cliques By comparing the external graph before the airdrop event with the PSP transaction graph after it , we attempt to find the hunters that are not allowed by the ParaSwap policy , where one individual or organization controls multiple addresses to obtain multiple rewards . As mentioned in the above section , the presence of CEXs would substantially obfuscate the flow of tracking transactions , we choose to deal with the most intuitive and obvious p2p token transactions . We numerically assign each component with ID and exclude be - haviors that have a low probability of being identified as arbitrage , such as those components consisting of only two or three members , and instead focus on subgraphs with more than five nodes , which is the threshold of getting ParaSwap’s focus when examining el - igibility 13 . Our goal is to evaluate existing allocation methods to discuss their plausibility and discover what methods hunters use to escape scrutiny from DApps . To address this issue , we retrieve the members’ information of components appearing in the PSP transaction graph and match them to the external graph to discover their interrelationship before detection . 6 . 2 . 1 The Organized and Planned Hunter . This small clique’s cen - ter consists of 4 non - airdrop addresses , as presented in Figure 12 . The other 17 initial members were not related in any way prior to the award , but they were all funded by these four " sponsors " through direct transfers to provide funds for airdrop eligibility . This sponsorship was sophisticated planning , with each initial member being backed up by multiple sponsors , and the PSP tokens were smoothly returned by the sponsorship route as designed after the rewards were distributed . Given that registering addresses on the blockchain costs nothing , and since there is no direct connection between addresses partici - pating in airdrop slots , community regulators can barely identify and decipher fake airdrop bidders’ behavior generated by " Sponsor - ship Models " like this , unless they look further than their second degree of association . However , given social and public opinion considerations , a strict but imprecise screening policy could trigger 13 https : / / medium . com / paraswap / whats - an - active - user - clarifying - psp - token - distribution - filtering - logic - 81df6096d410 CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Sizheng Fan , Tian Min , Xiao Wu , and Wei Cai more intense resistance from already disgruntled users , exposing the program to irreversible reputation damage and user loss . Figure 13 : Clique ID - 381 6 . 2 . 2 The Cautious Hunter . This small group is a typical aggre - gation pattern with more than five participants judging from the PSP transaction graph on the right in Figure 13 . Only seventeen of the nineteen initial members were present in the external graph before 15 𝑡ℎ November , but they are not fully connected by edges . Based on the strong association of these addresses embodied in the PSP transaction graph on the right , it is reasonable to believe that other discrete nodes in the external graph are likely to be funded through CEXs , which means they can be funded without traces in our external transaction history or some other sponsoring node that strays from the airdrop reward list . Figure 14 : Clique ID - 776 6 . 2 . 3 The Blatant Hunter . Figure 14 exhibits part of the typical pattern of a large number of prevalent components that are heavily linked in the external graph and aggregate the resulting rewards to one initial member after the airdrop is issued . They are often composed of exactly five nodes , which is right under the detection conditions claimed by ParaSwap . However , how should we think about this category of hunters who are on the edge of the rules ? The contributions they make to qualify for airdrop meet the criteria of the community rules in monetary terms , but does this mean that the relationship be - tween hunters and the community can be eased ? Although , at this point , ParaSwap has not made its own screening code publicly available , we do not know what happened . But from a researcher’s perspective , there is no doubt that arbitrage undermines the de - gree of decentralization that is the very core concept of blockchain platforms and Web3 communities . 6 . 3 Discussion on Hunters and Network Analysis While there is much research now seeking to depict a vision of a harmonious , equal , accessible , and open Metaverse or Web3 com - munity [ 16 , 54 ] , we have to be reminded that we are dealing with a field that contains complex behavioral studies under anonymity , sophisticated economic models , and fierce mistrust as a foundation . Like the real - world problem of resource allocation and how govern - ment grants are distributed to stimulate economic recovery , this problem in the blockchain community may be a microcosm of the macroeconomic problem . Airdrop intends to increase user reten - tion , distribute governance tokens to members who are genuinely engaged in the community , and decentralize DApps for stable long - term growth . However , the p2p cliques that we detected included more than half of the initial members , and the real situation is undoubtedly more than that , considering the prevalence of CEXs and mixing services [ 58 ] . The number of organizations or individu - als operating behind these addresses will be far smaller than the number of users shown on the surface . With the presence of such a large percentage of addresses suspected of hunting airdrop , the stability of the airdrop currency issued would be detrimental or even disastrous . The most immediate damage is monetary . As with stocks , a sell - off will bring down the price , but unlike stocks , free token trading on the blockchain does not have a mandatory circuit breaker mechanism . All holders of tokens will collectively face a price drop , at which point an avalanche - like chain reaction will send holders scrambling to sell in time to stop losses that can be enough to wipe out a token’s value . Systematically , the decentralization of DApps has also been un - dermined . It is worth noting that PSP Token also carries with it the responsibility of governance , meaning that in receiving rewards from airdrop , addresses simultaneously gain their respective de - grees of voice and voting power , and holders are entitled to vote on decisions for the community . However , the presence of hunters occupies the rights that should be given to dozens of people into the hands of a small number of actual address holders , which is enough to cause the divergence or even the demise of a decentral - ized community , as the example mentioned of the Juno Network . When the decentralization of a DApp is null and void , and from the monetary aspect , it becomes unprofitable for its users , it is hard to imagine any other basis for its continuation . On a higher level , the instability caused by the challenges of decentralization will inevitably damage the credibility and growth potential of a DApp . We believe that improvements can be made in terms of both screening methods and distribution policies . Although there is a nearly impenetrable and untraceable black box of CEXs , project owners should be able to track the network of more than second - degree relationships based on token transfers , thus excluding hunter cliques such as the " sponsor model " we find above . Or by compar - ing the behavior of addresses before and after the airdrop , using Making Sense of Roles in Web3 Community from Airdrop Perspective CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany whether or not they are qualified as a label for the training set to obtain a classification algorithm for external graph features to filter at scale . In terms of the airdrop policy , we find that a tiered system of rewards will result in addresses with high rewards being more likely to engage in subsequent beneficial behaviors . More de - tailed and sophisticated tiered models may lead more participants to engage in positive activities like staking or providing liquidity . Apart from the cold and emotionless code design and sophisti - cated model , we believe there is a more HCI way to the solution of bringing altruism into the Web3 community . We need to investigate how to reduce the generation of things like arbitrage , aggressive behavior , and inequality at the motivational level in a community with a high degree of anonymity . As pointed out by Elsden et al . [ 18 ] , the most central issue appears to be some fundamental hu - man challenges , including financialization [ 43 ] , procedural trust , algorithmic governance , and front - end interactions . We suggest that in terms of Web3 community governance , the improvement can be conducted in two ways . The first is at the engineering level , where we argue that a figurative community enhances the sense of belonging of its members to a greater extent , which in return brings in more altruists . For example , a community of decentral - ized games can build stronger ties between players and content , and between players and players , than in a financial type DApp . Currently , no Metaverse - level platform can dominate and provide a space for digital people to exist in the true sense of the word . This means that a member in a loose community is nothing more than an unreachable piece of hexadecimal address to other members . Second , in terms of policy formulation , we argue that community leaders should always be wary of the negative effects of financial - ization . The blockchain platform is a huge and free market , and the impression it brings to the outside world has always been portrayed by the media as a shortcut to overnight riches , which in part has led to the current speculative culture in the entire field . 7 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE VISION Our research shows that , at this stage , decentralized communi - ties are far from what they were designed to be . Airdrop hunters and speculators who might crowd out the space of community enthusiasts force other willing community members to give up their community - beneficial behavior . We conclude our result as challenges for future research with conceptual and methodological solutions to the current predicament . 7 . 1 Expand the Ways of Interaction Studies on the influence of technologies and user experience ( UX ) design have suggested that a refined interaction can cause positive effects on user participation [ 48 , 49 ] . Off - the - shelf measurement frameworks have also long been available [ 9 ] , but few of us bring the blockchain interaction down to the practical experiment . Although the blockchain network is claimed as Web3 , from a user experience perspective , blockchain games , financial services , and other DApps are still in their primitive stage after so many years compared to the traditional Internet . Many studies have focused on designing user interactions for real - life Internet of Things applications rather than for virtual social network interactions [ 21 ] . We propose that in the future , with the rise of technologies such as VR / AR [ 22 , 45 ] , a pervasive and ambitious blockchain social network , such as the Metaverse , could be established to trigger users’ motivation for engaging the community . However , it does not necessarily require cutting - edge technologies like VR / AR , a set of social layers of virtual identities on top of real ones while protecting anonymity can be applied and tested for its positive influence . For communities running on the particular infrastructure of blockchain , we currently know very little about the impact of interaction on these blockchain users and do not know if traditional approaches can motivate them or build strong connections or a sense of belonging between members and the community . 7 . 2 Slow Down the Pace of Financialization As far as the decentralized community level is concerned , the idea of slowing down the pace of financialization is to separate the gov - ernance from tradable tokens . The financial attributes of blockchain cause a zero - sum game scenario that can significantly reduce the likelihood of cooperation among people . Giving the token both fi - nancial and governance features could be dangerous , as if allowing vote trading in real - life politics . The factual data results , as dis - cussed in Section 4 , show 86 . 39 % of initial members sold out their PSP and thus left the community within six months . This phenom - enon indicates that most of the initial members are attracted to the financial attributes of airdrop than the governance attributes . Con - sidering the more than two million airdrop screening participants in the case of ParaSwap , financialization is an excellent incentive to attract users in the short term , however , in the long run , it cannot help retaining users and promote community engagement . How do we design and evaluate a separate governance system ? We consider that a new ERC token standard could be proposed to create a non - tradable , or worthless , voting ticket for participation in community governance , solving the problems in a blockchain way . However , separating the two would violate the design essence of property and ownership of digital assets . Another incentive mechanism can be applied in the form of rewards engaging the voting layer . Although what discussed above is just a brief idea , the key point is that the HCI community could play an important role in prototyping , envisioning , and evaluating such models . 7 . 3 Improve the Model of Community Governance and Empowerment Ethereum offers any individual or organization a chance to establish their own circulable tokens with very relaxed restrictions on setting regulations and distribution models . It is the equivalent of a New York Stock Exchange with no vetting or restrictions , where anyone can conduct an initial public offering ( IPO ) to raise capital . Small and medium - sized teams with potential and strength have more opportunities to express their ambitions , but the majority left are frauds , bubbles , and Ponzi schemes [ 25 , 51 ] . This hostile environment is one of the primary reasons pre - venting the development of stable decentralized communities . The efforts of researchers in this area should be instrumental in develop - ing rules and policies , and the design of resource allocation by fur - ther understanding blockchain users and their roles . To give some simple , unexplored examples , we have difficulty understanding CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Sizheng Fan , Tian Min , Xiao Wu , and Wei Cai the behavior patterns of community builders and project initiators . Are there certain characteristics of their outreach on social media , such as Twitter ? Do their conversations in discussion groups reflect potential fraud ? What kind of white paper attracts investors the most ? How does a committee of decentralized community work ? Essentially , we try to show that exploring HCI in the blockchain is not limited to the user side but should also look broadly at other parties , such as rule makers and companies holding huge amounts of money , and design policy and resource allocation models that can coordinate the relationships between these parties . Moreover , as outlined in the conclusion of Section 5 . 8 , we pro - posed a multi - staged airdrop model that releases the second round reward based on the role identification of the initial round . Simi - larly , there is still significant potential in the airdrop strategy and the process of empowering participants , which are vital elements in constructing decentralized communities . 7 . 4 Understanding the Perception of Members in Decentralized Community Understanding users’ behavior and values is crucial for incentiviz - ing and building a community . If we can summarize their behavioral characteristics as well as the values and ideologies [ 33 ] driving be - hind them , perhaps the answer can be more easily obtained . On a cognitive level , the blockchain is still in its infancy and requires user education and a new way of thinking [ 2 ] . We lack evidence of the linkage between the user’s level of professional knowledge and willingness to be a contributor . Will a sophisticated member be more profit - oriented ? Or will a newbie dedicate more to the commu - nity ? Although some blockchain - based social or instant messaging platforms have started to emerge in recent years , it is extremely difficult and time - consuming to investigate members of decentral - ized communities , especially those who are considered speculators and airdrop hunters behind the heavy curtain of anonymity . As an example of our work , we could obtain more valuable infor - mation if a qualitative study on roles is conducted , but reaching a sufficient number of ParaSwap users to produce valid results is dif - ficult given the background of the anonymous nature of blockchain . For role identification , although we have successfully labeled and categorized community members in terms of objective results , per - haps the categorization method would be more convincing if we recruited several users for each type of role for interviews and com - bined their motivations and behaviors for discussion . For clique detection , there is a high probability that airdrop hunters capable of conducting Sybil attack - like operations are people with consider - able experience and background knowledge of blockchain technol - ogy , which could indicate that a profound understanding may not lead to an altruistic community member . However , this hypothesis can only remain at the conjecture stage until there is definitive evidence of the investigation . To use a more precise example , we want to know what factors lead to positive or negative behavior . For Diamond Holder , we want to understand their reasons for hold - ing PSP for a long time and the motivating factors behind these reasons , such as the amount of digital assets they hold , their views on the future development of the project , etc . For Buyer , we can summarize their commonalities to deduce the reasons behind their buying behavior . In addition , when we find that interviewees have multiple addresses classified as different roles , qualitative study results can indicate users’ habit of using multiple addresses . In addition to surveys of certain specific users , a large - scale study on an open social platform or discussion group analysis would also be helpful . Jahani et al . [ 28 ] conducted an exploratory study of the characteristics of online discussion around cryptocurrency forums . They concluded that projects with more information available and higher levels of technical innovation are associated with higher discussion quality through regression analysis . This kind of social computing research , which is not a stranger to us , would provide a wealth of topics worth exploring if it could be linked to the results generated from transaction records . For example , in a decentral - ized community with a high percentage of speculators and airdrop hunters , what kind of characteristics does the discourse on the forum have ? Or conversely , we can explore whether a harmonious communication atmosphere is more likely to lead to an altruistic community environment . 7 . 5 Future Challenge for Decentralized Community in Web3 As aforementioned in Section 3 . 2 , unlike studies on community gov - ernance and moderation on Web 2 . 0 [ 14 , 31 ] , most of the current blockchain community is more concerned with the development di - rection and resource allocation policy of DApps . However , with the rapid development of blockchain , some content - centric supporting infrastructures and corresponding streaming or social DApps such as Odysee 14 are being developed [ 36 ] . In general , decentralized , online social media built with distributed storage as the back - end is not a new concept . They try to build a social network with no censorship , no single point of failure , and user autonomy that can support content verification through trust , and reputation [ 34 ] . Blockchain , in this situation , plays a fundamental role by provid - ing a transparent , immutable underlying facility for information storage and retrieval [ 42 ] , proof as a service [ 18 ] , and incentives for providing content or authentication [ 6 ] . However , when DApps begin to evolve from such token ex - change services into things that can be used by the average Internet user on a daily basis , away from the abstract virtual finance and cyberspace , how do these ahead - of - the - curve and idealistic prod - ucts face real - world regulations ? For example , Sağlam et al . [ 8 ] pointed out that only 27 . 5 % of blockchain systems covered Euro - pean Union’s General Data Production Regulation ( GDPR ) through legal documents with privacy policies or terms and conditions . In addition to the internal aspect of privacy protection , the external threats of violating behavior , such as inflammatory speech , plagia - rism , harassment , or even scams and crimes of cryptocurrency , still exist . Blockchain social network systems may introduce more new problems while keeping all the issues of the Web 2 . 0 community , which seems difficult to address , rely on loose community mem - bers without a robust executive body , or compromise the degree of decentralization . We propose that this specific moderation issue of users as shareholders on an equal footing with developers needs different ways of design and evaluation from the " Manage - Regu - lated " model of Web 2 . 0 . But on the other hand , blockchain , as a new 14 https : / / odysee . com / Making Sense of Roles in Web3 Community from Airdrop Perspective CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany infrastructure , may technically give some existing Web 2 . 0 com - munity moderation tools new possibilities and scope to perform . For example , for the governance of online speech [ 46 ] , the easy incentives facilitated by blockchain can support the establishment of positive role models or the tracing and discourage anti - social behavior with its public and transparent records . Mechanisms like governance tokens as rewards could also be used to select mem - bers from the community as stewards , giving them more power to further drive the community in a favorable direction . But the challenge that we think is more worthy of attention is something more fundamental : the process of building community . We see our work not as being limited to a specific decentralized community or scenario , but as an exploration of the airdrop , as part of building the community and empowering its members . As the previous step to operating and governing a community , the grow - ing stage of a decentralized community should be spent with the same research effort . While the vast majority of addresses exhibit arbitrage behavior , Web3 builders may need to rethink whether the users share their values and are ready for decentralization . 8 CONCLUSION To sum up , in this paper , we use a detailed data - driven approach to understand altruistic and profit - oriented members in a decen - tralized community . We explore the rationality of airdrop as a kind of incentive mechanism and affirm the contribution of part of this allocation method : the differential tiers can be a potential method to encourage community - beneficial behaviors . We also perform a network analysis to identify the airdrop hunter’s methods through multiple accounts . Our findings lead us to a discussion on the un - derlying causes of the current predicament and future direction of the decentralized community in Web3 . We suggest that taxonomy of roles based on the public data could be a promising solution to support the empowerment process of the community . We propose that , beyond the technical difficulties , between the current decen - tralized community and the goals of the ideal Metaverse , there are still complex issues related to human factors , social organization , and financialized markets that require the participation of the HCI community . Moreover , with the development of Web3 , we also raise potential governance issues regarding blockchain - based content platforms or social networks by analogy to Web 2 . 0 . We hope that our work could play a role in advancing the understanding of this unique emerging technology and form of community , and further motivate researchers to push forwards the boundaries and expand the possibility of governance .
