Cortactin , an 80 / 85 - Kilodalton p p 6 0 src Substrate , Is a Filamentous Actin - binding Protein Enriched in the Cell Cortex Hong Wu and J . Thomas Parsons Department of Microbiology and Cancer Center , University of Virginia Health Sciences Center , Charlottesville , Virginia 22908 Abstract . Two relatexl cellular proteins , p80 and p85 ( cortactin ) , become phosphorylated on tyrosine in pp60 " ~ - transformed cells and in cells stimulated with certain growth factors . The amino - terminal half of cortactin is comprised of multiple copies of an inter - nal , tandem 37 - amino acid repeat . The carboxyl - terminal half contains a distal SH3 domain . We report that cortactin is an F - actin - binding protein . The bind - ing to F - actin is specific and saturable . The amino - terminal repeat region appears to be both necessary and sufficient to mediate actin binding , whereas the SH3 domain had no apparent effect on the actin - binding activity . Cortactin , present in several different cell types , is enriched in cortical structures such as membrane ruffles and lamellipodia . The properties of cortactin indicate that it may be important for microfilament - membrane interactions as well as trans - ducing signals from the cell surface to the cytoskele - ton . We suggest the name cortactin , reflecting the cor - tical subcellular localization and its actin - binding activity . C ELLS undergo structural rearrangement during cell division , cell migration , oncogenic transformation , and in response to stimulation with a variety of ex - tracellular ligands ( Albert et al . , 1989 ) . Vertebrate cells ex - hibit a cortical cytoskeletal network that resides beneath , and is associated with , the inner surface of the plasma mem - brane ( Bray et al . , 1986 ) . This cortical cytoskeleton is com - prised of a dense network of actin filaments and associated actin - binding proteins ( Small et al . , 1981 ; Stossel et al . , 1981 ) . Components of both the cell cortex and the plasma membrane are important for the integration of cell surface signals , facilitating transfer of these signals to the interior of the cell . The alterations in cortical cytoskeleton accompany a variety of cellular processes , including phagocytosis , cytokinesis , cell locomotion , cell - cell and cell - substratum interaction , transmembrane signaling , secretion , and en - docytosis ( for reviews see Tilney , 1983 ; Albert et al . , 1989 ; Bretscher , 1991 ) . The structure and physical properties of the cortical cytoskeleton are determined , in large part , by cooperative and competitive interactions among many actin - binding pro - teins ( Albert et al . , 1989 ) . Based on both in vitro and in vivo studies , a large number of actin - binding proteins have been identified that control assembly and length of actin filaments , link actin filaments into bundles or networks , define the three - dimensional organization of actin filaments and link filaments to other cytoplasmic and membrane components ( for reviews see Stossel et al . , 1985 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ; Albert et al . , 1989 ; Stossel , 1989 ; Vandekerckhove , 1990 ; Hartwig and Kwiatkowski , 1991 ) . Subcellular local - ization studies have shown that many of the actin - binding proteins , such as filamin , villin , gelsolin , and ezrin , are enriched in the submembranous cortical region ( Bretscher , 1991 ) . In addition , the interaction of many actin - binding proteins with either monomeric actin or filamentous actin ( F - actin ) 1 is regulated by common intracellular signals , in - eluding calcium , calmodulin , phospholipids , and protein phosphorylation ( Vandekerckhove , 1990 ; Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ; Hartwig et al . , 1992 ) . Studies on the regulation of gel - solin and profilin by Ca : * and phosphatidylinositides have provided models for the reorganization of actin filament net - work ( Stossel , 1989 ) . In vivo studies have documented changes in the activity of certain actin - binding proteins con - comitant with cellular events such as receptor stimulation and mitosis ( Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ; Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991 ; Hartwig et al . , 1992 ) . The functional signifi - cance of actin - binding proteins is further emphasized by the diverse phenotypes exhibited in cell lines or transgenic or - ganisms which either lack or overexpress actin - binding pro - teins ( for review see Noegel and Schleicher , 1991 ) . Cellular transformation by oncogenic tyrosine kinases is characterized by overt changes in cellular growth control and dramatic changes in cell morphology and cell surface topol - ogy ( for reviews see Jove and Hanafusa , 1987 ; Parsons and Weber , 1989 ) . Chicken embryo ( CE ) cells transformed by pp60s % the oncogenic tyrosine kinase encoded by Rous sarcoma virus , are morphologically round . This phenotype is accompanied by loss of actin stress fibers and aggregation of F - actin into podosomes ( David - Pfeuty and Singer , 1980 ; 1 .

The importance of the cytoskeleton in cellular trans - formation by protein tyrosine kinase oncogenes has been supported by the study of src mutants . The transforming ac - tivity of the various pp60 s ' ~ mutants correlates with the de - gree of their association with detergent - insoluble cytoskele - ton elements ( Hamaguchi and Hanafusa , 1987 ) . The study of cellular substrates of pp60 ~ ' ~ has also pointed to the in - volvement of cytoskeletal proteins in the process of cellular transformation and cell signaling ( for reviews see Hunter , 1989 ; Schaller et al . , 1993b ) . Several newly characterized pp60 s ~ substrates are either cytoskeletal proteins or as - sociated with the cytoskeleton . These include FAK , a focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ( Schaller et al . , 1992 ) ; ppl20 , a tyrosine - phosphorylated protein that shares se - quence similarity with plakoglobin and armadillo ( Kanner et al . , 1991a ; Reynolds et al . , 1992 ) ; pp110 , a phosphotyrosine - containing protein that localizes to stress fibers in CE cells ( Kanner et al . , 1991b ; Flynn , D . C . , and J . T . Parsons , manu - script in preparation ) ; tensin , an F - actin capping and bun - dling protein ( Davis et al . , 1991 ) ; p22 caveolin , a coating protein for nonclathrin - coated pits ( Glermey and Zokas , 1989 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) ; and paxillin , a focal adhesion protein associated with vinculin ( Turner et al . , 1990 ) . Recently , we reported the identification of two proteins , designated p80 / 85 , which are substrates for activated pp60 " ~ protein tyrosine kinase ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . p80 / 85 is also tyrosine phosphorylated in cells stimulated with EGF , PDGF , colony stimulating factor I ( Downing and Reynolds , 1992 ; Maa et al . , 1992 ) , and in platelets stimulated with thrombin ( Wong et al . , 1992 ; Lipfert , L . , and J . S . Brugge , personal communication ) , p80 / 85 exhibits several unique structural features . The amino - terminal half of the protein is comprised of multiple copies of an internal , tandem 37 - amino acid repeat ( referred to as " repeat region " ) . The number of repeat units appears to be specified by alternative splicing since , in CE cells , cDNAs have been identified that encode proteins with five ( p80 ) or six copies ( p85 ) of the tan - dem repeat ( Hildebrand , J . D . , and J . T . Parsons , manuscript in preparation ) . The carboxyl - terminal half of the protein contains a distal SH3 ( src homology 3 ) domain , preceded by a region of 50 amino acids with a predicted helical structure and a region rich in proline , serine , and threonine . Here we report that p80 / 85 protein is an F - actin - binding protein . The binding to F - actin is specific and saturable . The amino - terminal repeat region of the protein appears to be both necessary and sufficient to mediate actin binding . Deletions removing the SH3 domain , the helical region , and the pro - line / serine / threonine region , had no apparent effect on the actin - binding activity , p80 / 85 is present in several different cell types and in each is enriched in cortical structures such as membrane ruffles and lamellipodia . The submembranous location of p80 / 85 indicates that the protein may be impor - tant for microfflament - membrane interaction as well as transducing signals from the cell surface to the cytoskeleton . Based on the cortical localization and actin - binding proper - ties of p80 / 85 , we propose the name " cortactin : Materials and Methods Preparation of Cell Extracts Primary CE cells were prepared from 10 - d embryos ( SPAFAS Inc . , Nor - wich , CT ) . CE cells were transformed by transfecting cells with plasmid DNA containing the activated c - src gene , c - src527F , as described previ - ously ( Reynolds et al . , 1989 ) . Both normal and transformed CE cells were maintained in DME with 5 % FBS . CE cells were lysed by incubating cells with ice - cold G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HC1 pH 8 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 0 . 2 mM CaCI2 ) for 15 rain , followed by 30 strokes with a tight - fitting Dounce homogenizer . Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g for 10 rain . The proteins were subjected to SDS - PAGE analysis , and im - munobiotted with either 5 / ~ g / ml of purified anticortactin mAbs ( 4FI 1 or 1H3 ) or afffinity - purified rabbit phosphotyrosine antibodies , as previously described ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . F - actin Cosedimentation Assay Rabbit muscle actin was purified as described ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) . The purity of the actin preparation was assessed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . Typically , actin preparations were > 90 - 95 % pure , as judged by the relative staining ofa 43 - kD actin band . Purified actin was stored in G - buffer . Aetin was polymerized by adjusting the buffer condi - tion to that of F - buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HC1 pH 8 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCI2 , 50 mM KC1 , 2 mM MgCI2 , and 1 mM ATP ) . F - actin cosedimentation assays were performed by mixing either 50 t ~ l CE cel lysate , 5 - 10 / ~ 1 of in vitro translation products , or 0 . 5 - 17 ttg of glutathiune - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein with 15 - 30 # g of polymer - ized actin . The mixture ( 55 - 100 t ~ l ) was incubated on ice for 1 h , and then layered over 50 td of 10 % sucrose in F - buffer and centrifuged for 15 rain or 1 h at 100 , 000 g at 4 ~ in a Ti42 . 2 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . , Fullerton , CA ) ( Pope and Weeds , 1986 ; Hug et al . , 1992 ) . After removal of the supernatant , the pellet was incubated for at least 1 h with 50 td of G - buffer at 4 ~ and then solubilized in hot sample buffer ( I . aemmli , 1970 ) . The supernatant and pellet fractions were fractionated by SDS - FAGE , ana - lyzed either by immnnoblotting with anticortactin mAbs , fluorography , or by Coomassie blue staining . For mAb inlubition of cortactin binding to F - actin , CE lysates were preincubated with individual anticortactin mAbs ( 1 - 3 # g mAb / 100 / ~ g cell protein ) on ice for I h before mixing the lysate with F - actin . To assess the binding of GST . pS0 fusion protein , 0 . 5 - 17 / ~ g of purified fusion protein was incubated with 15 t , g of polymerized actin in a total vol - ume of 75 / ~ 1 . The cosedimentation assay was performed as described above . The pellet was washed three times with F - hnffer before solubiliza - tion . Supernatant and solubilized pellet fractions were fractionated by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . To quantitate the amount of fusion protein , several different concentrations of BSA were included in the same gel to serve as internal protein concentration standards . The stained BSA and fusion protein bands were quantitated using a Visage 4000 ( Biolmage , Ann Arbor , MI ) in combination with whole band analysis software . The data were analyzed using GraphPad Inplot , version 4 . 0 ( Graph Pad Software for Sci . , San Diego , CA ) . Construction of Plasmids Encoding GST Fusion Proteins and Fusion Protein Preparation A eDNA encoding the 80 - kD form of cortactin was subcloned into pBluescript vector ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Restriction enzyme frag - ments containing different coding regions of pS0 were subcloned into a pGex vector ( Fig . 1 ) , in frame with sequences encoding the GST ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) . GST . pS0 was constructed using a BamI - II - EcoRI frag - ment of p80 eDNA , containing amino acid residues 55 - 526 ; GST . 55 - 292 contains a BamHI - BsmI fragment and GST . 294 - 526 contains a BsmI - EcoRI fragment , encoding amino acid residues 55 - 292 and 294 - 526 , re - spectively . The induction of fusion proteins was performed as described by Smith and Johnson ( 1988 ) . The bacteria were resuspended in MTFBS buffer ( 150 mM NaCI , 16 mM Na2HPO , t , 4 mM NaH2PO , t , pH 7 . 3 ) containing 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 10 mM EDTA , and 50 ttg / ml leupeptin . Cells were lysed by sonication after addition of Triton X - 100 to 1 % . The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g for 10 rain . 50 - - 100 # 1 of the su - pernatant was mixed with 20 - 40 / zl of 50 % glutathiune Sepharose 4B beads ( Pharmacia , Uppsaia , Sweden ) at room temperature for 5 rain . The beads were washed three times with MTPBS and the GST fusion protein was eluted by mixing the beads with 20 mM glutathione , 50 mM Tris - HCi , pH 7 . 5 at room temperature for 5 rain . The elution was repeated . The elnted material was pooled and used for further experiments . The fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , detected either by Coomassie blue staining or by immunoblotting with anticortactin mAbs .

Bacteria were resuspended in 20 ml MTPBS and sonicated as described . The lysate was centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 rain at 4 ~ The supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of glutathione beads at 4 ~ for 1 h with rocking . The beads were washed three times with MTPBS and the fusion proteins were eluted by mixing the beads with 1 ml of the same elution buffer at room temperature for 2 rain ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ; Hug et al . , 1992 ) . In Vitro Transcription and Translation A eDNA clone of the 80 - kD form of cortactin in pBluescript was digested with individual restriction enzymes as indicated in Fig . 1 . Messenger RNAs were transcribed from individual DNA templates using an mRNA capping kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) containing T7 DNA polymerase and a 7 - methylguanosine CAP analog . 5 ~ g of template DNA was used per 50 - t ~ l reaction . Translation was carried out in a rabbit reticniocyte lysate ( Promega Corp . , Madison , WI or Stratngene ) . A typical 50 - ~ d translation reaction contained 25 ~ , 1 reticulocyte lysate , 40 / ~ Ci pSS ] methionine ( 1 , 139 Ci / mmol , Dupont , NEN Research Products , Boston , MA ) , and ' ~ 20 % of the heat - denatured RNA from a single transcription reaction . The reaction mix - ture was incubated at 30 ~ for 60 rain and 5 - 10 - pl aliquots were used for F - actin cosedimentation assays ( Neff et al . , 1991 ) . Labeled translation prod - ucts were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE and detected by fluorograpby . Immunofluorescence Microscopy Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried Out as previously described ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Cells were seeded and grown overnight on glass cover - slips , washed with PBS , fixed , and permeabilized . Permeabilized cells were incubated with primary anticortactin mAbs and then with rabbit anti - mouse IgG , and detected with F1TC - conjngated donkey anti - rabbit IgG as previ - ously described ( Wu et ai . , 1991 ) . For double immunostaining experiments , cells were also incubated with rhodamine - phalloidin as previously de - scribed ( Wu et al : , 1991 ) . Samples were visualized with a Leitz Orthoplan fluorescence microscope . For cytochalasin D treatment , cells were in - cubated with 2 I ~ M cytochalasin D in growth media for 15 rain at 37 ~ be - fore fixation ( Cooper , 1987 ) . Results Localization of Cortactin to the Cell Cortex Previous experiments have shown that p80 / 85 or cortactin colocalizes with F - actin in the peripheral extensions of nor - mad cells and podosomes ( rosettes ) of pp60 " ~ - transformed cells ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Indirect immunofluorescence of spreading CE cells using anticortactin mAbs revealed in - tense staining of cortical structures such as the membrane ruffles and lamelliopodia ( Fig . 2 , a and b ) . The same stain - ing pattern was observed in several other adherent cell types , including rat aortic smooth muscle cells and rat endothelial cells ( Fig . 2 , c and d ) . The staining pattern is very similar to that of cortical actin as judged by costalning experiments with phalloidin ( data not shown ) . Cells incubated with the microfilament disrupting agent cytochalasin D exhibited a dramatic alteration in the staining pattern of cortactin . The resulting cytoplasmic aggregates of cortactin colocalized with F - actin aggregates , as demonstrated by costalning of the cells with anticortactin mAb and phalloidin ( Fig . 2 , e and f ) . The result of such immunostaining experiments indicated a colocalization of cortactin with F - actin and suggested a possible direct interaction of cortactin with F - actin .

Binding of Cortactin to F - actin To test the possible binding of cortactin to F - actin , CE cell lysates were incubated with polymerized rabbit muscle actin and an F - actin cosedimentation assay was carried out . After sedimentation of F - actin , > 95 % of the cortactin present in Figure 3 . Cosedimentation of cortactin with F - actin . 50 # 1 of CE cell lysates , prepared as described in Materials and Methods , were incubated with either 15 / ~ g ( a , lanes 2 ; b , lanes I ) or 7 t ~ g ( a , lanes 3 ; b , lanes 2 ) of rabbit muscle F - actin , and the mixture was cen - trifuged . Aliquots of supernatant ( lanes S ) and pellet ( lanes P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE . Equal amounts of the samples were either immunoblotted with mAb 4F11 ( panel a ) or stained with Coomas - sie blue ( b ) . As controls , CE cell lysate without F - actin was cen - trifuged ( a , lanes 1 ) ; 10 # g BSA was mixed with F - actin and cen - trifuged ( b , lanes 3 ) .

As a control , an aliquot of GST . pS0 fusion protein was centrifuged without preincubation with F - aetin 0anes 1 ) . The position of the GST . pSO fusion protein and the major proteolytic product as welt as actin are indicated . Molecular mass markers are shown in lane M and the sizes are indicated at the left in kD . the cell lysate cosedimented with F - actin ( Fig . 3 , a , lanes 2 and 3 ) . In the absence of F - actin , cortactin remained in the supernatant fraction ( Fig . 3 , a , lanes / ) . As shown in b , the majority of the F - actin sedimented to the pellet fraction un - der conditions of the assay , indicating a quantitative poly - merization of the monomeric actin . In control incubations , BSA , which does not have actin - binding activity , remained in the supernatant fraction ( Fig . 3 b , lanes 3 ) . Similar bind - ing of cortactin to F - actin was observed when purified chicken muscle F - actin was used in the assay ( data not shown ) . The results of the cosedimentation assay indicated that cortactin , present in CE cell lysates , may bind directly to F - actin . To further test this hypothesis , [ 35S ] methionine - labeled cortactin , synthesized by in vitro translation of cor - tactin mRNA in a reficulocyte lysate , was used in an F - actin cosedimentation assay . A significant portion of the in vitro - translated 80 - kD form of cortactin cosedimented with F - actin , providing evidence for the direct interaction of cortactin with F - actin ( see Fig . 6 , lanes lb ) . Since it was possible that the interaction of cortactin with F - actin might be mediated through a cellular component present in either the CE cell lysate or the reticulocyte lysate , cortactin was expressed as a GST fusion protein in Esche - richia coli and its actin - binding properties were investigated . The GST . p80 fusion protein contains amino acid residues 55 - 526 of pS0 fused in frame to sequences encoding GST .

The concentrations of bound and free fusion protein were determined by quantitation of individual bands on a densitometer .

Moreover , addition of increasing amounts of GST . p80 protein to a fixed amount of F - actin in the cosedimentation assay revealed that the binding of cor - tactin to F - actin was saturable ( Fig . 4 , lanes 3 and 4 ) . Best fit analysis of the binding data indicated the presence of a sin - gle binding site ( Fig . 5 ) . At saturation , the binding stoichi - ometry is ~ ol GST . p80 protein per 14 actin monomers ( Fig . 5 ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that cortactin from three different sources binds efficiently to F - actin , pro - viding evidence that cortactin interacts directly with F - actin . Mapping of F - actin Binding Site to Repeat Region of Cortactin The specificity of the interaction of cortactin with F - actin was further assessed by mapping the region of cortactin that is necessary for the binding . [ 35S ] Methionine - labeled cor - tactin was synthesized by directing in vitro transcription - translation reactions with individual pS0 cDNA constructs , illustrated in Fig . 1 b . To generate a series of carboxyl - termi - hal truncated cortactin molecules , p80 cDNAs were digested with restriction enzymes that cleave within the 3 ' portion of the coding sequence ( Fig . 1 b ) . Internal deletions were cre - ated by in - frame ligation of p80 eDNA fragments generated by cleavage with specific restriction enzymes ( Fig . 1 b ) . Binding to F - actin was tested in an F - actin cosedimentation assay ( Fig . 6 ) . Truncated cortactin , lacking the SH3 domain ( d1486 - 526 and d1392 - 526 , lanes 2b and 3b ) or lacking the carboxyl - terminal half of the protein ( d1293 - 526 , lanes 6b ) cosedimented with F - actin , mimicking the activity of the full - length protein ( lanes lb ) . In contrast , an internal deletion of amino acid residues 108 - 382 , which deleted the complete repeat region , as well as the following helical region and most of the proline - rich region ( Fig . 1 b ) , did not cosediment with F - actin ( Fig . 6 , lanes 5b ) . A cortactin variant , with a smaller internal deletion which removed amino acid residues 142 - 210 within the repeat region , showed a significantly decreased binding to F - actin ( lanes 4b ) . These results indi - cated that the amino acid sequences comprising the carboxyl - terminal half of the protein , including the SH3 domain , were not required for the binding of cortactin to F - actin . Instead , the tandemly repeated sequences comprising the repeat re - gion appeared to be necessary for the efficient binding of cor - tactin to F - actin . To assess which sequences of cortactin were sufficient to reconstitute the F - actin binding activity , the amino - and carboxyl - terminal halves of pS0 were fused separately to GST and expressed as GST fusion proteins in E . coli . Figure 6 . Binding of in vitro - truncated cortactin with F - ac - tin . [ 35S ] Methionine - labeled proteins were synthesized in vitro using various cortactin cDNA constructs ( diagrammed in Fig .

Purified GST fusion proteins ( illustrated in Fig . 1 c ) were either preincubated with F - actin and centrifuged ( lanes 2 , 4 , and 6 ) or centrifuged alone ( lanes 1 , 3 , and 5 ) .

GST . 55 - 292 and GST . 294 - 526 contain , respectively , amino acid residues 55 - 292 and 294 - 526 ( Fig . 1 c ) . As shown in Fig . 7 , GST . 55 - 292 cosedimented with F - actin , whereas the majority of GST . 294 - 526 remained in the supernatant . These results confirmed that the repeat region of cortactin participated in F - actin binding and indicated that this region may be sufficient for the binding . Although the repeat region appears to be both necessary and sufficient for F - actin bind - ing , we cannot rule out the possibility that there are other weaker actin - binding sites . The small amount of GST . 294 - 526 observed in the pellet fraction may be indicative of such a site in the carboxyl - terminal half of the protein ( lanes 6 ) . Inhibition of Cortactin - F - actin Interaction with mAbs As previously reported , several mAbs appear to interact with different epitopes within cortactin ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Four different mAbs were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of cortactin to F - actin ( Fig . 8 ) . Preincubation of cell lysates with anticortactin mAb 4FI1 before mixing with F - actin blocked the association of cortactin with F - actin ( Fig . 8 , lanes 3 and 4 ) . In contrast , preincubation of cell lysates with either mAb 1H3 ( lanes 6 ) , mAb 3B12 , or 3D9 ( data not shown ) did not affect the cosedimentation of cortactin with F - actin . To better understand the nature of the mAb inhibi - tion , we mapped the epitopes of mAb 4Fll and 1H3 . GST fusion proteins containing portions of cortactin were tested for their reactivity with the two mAbs in a Western blot . As shown in Fig . 9 , mAb 4Fll reacted with GST . pS0 ( lane / ) as well as GST . 55 - 292 ( lane 2 ) , but not with GST . 294 - 526 ( lane 3 ) . Conversely , mAb 1H3 reacted with GST . pS0 ( lane 4 ) and GST . 294 - 526 ( lane 6 ) , but not with GST . 55 - 292 ( lane 5 ) . This localized the binding sequences for 4F11 and 1H3 to the amino - terminal half and the carboxyl - terminal half of the protein , respectively . The epitopes for 4Fll and 1H3 were further mapped by immunoprecipitation of the individ - ual , in vitro - translated cortactin proteins ( summarized in Fig . 1 ) . A cortactin variant with a deletion of amino acid resi - dues 108 - 382 was not immunoprecipitated by mAb 4Fll , whereas variants with a deletion of amino acid residues 142 - 210 or lacking the carboxyl - tcrminal region were readily im - Figure 8 . Inhibition of cortactin binding to F - actin by anticortactin mAb . CE cell lysate ( lanes 1 ) and lysates pretreated with mAb 4Fll ( lanes 2 - 4 ) or mAb 1H3 ( lanes 5 and 6 ) were either incubated with F - actin and centrifuged ( lanes I , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) or centrifuged alone ( lanes 2 and 5 ) . Supernatant ( lanes S ) and pellet ( lanes P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and im - munoblotted with mAb 4FI1 .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , 1993 1422 b ~ gure la Binding of tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin with F - actin . Lysates from pp60s ' ~ - transformed CE cells were incubated with F - actin and centrifuged ( lanes 2 and 3 ) . Supernatant ( lanes 2S ) and pellet ( lanes P ) were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitro - cellulose , and immunoblotted with either phosphotyrosine anti - bodies ( a ) or mAb 4F11 ( b ) . As controls , the same amount of cell lysates were centrifuged without F - actin ( lanes 1 ) . In lanes 1S and 3S , the supernatant fractions were immunoprecipitated with mAb 4FI 1 and the immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted with either phosphotyrosine antibodies ( a ) or mAb 4Fll ( b ) . In a , lysates from CE cells ( lane C ) or pp60s ' ~ - trans - formed CE cells ( lane F ) were also resolved by SDS - PAGE and im - munoblotted with phosphotyrosine antibodies . The position of the major cortactin bands is indicated by an arrowhead . Molecular mass markers are indicated in kD . munoprecipitated with mAb 4F11 . These data indicated that the amino acid sequences within the regions of residues 211 - 383 or 107 - 141 were required for recognition by mAb 4FI1 . In light of the fact that 4Fll immunoblotted GST . 55 - 292 which contains amino acid residues 55 - 292 , it is likely that the 4FI 1 epitope resides within the repeat region of cortactin . Truncated cortactin molecules lacking the carboxyl - terminal 40 amino acid residues were not immunoprecipitated by mAb 1H3 , mapping the 1H3 epitope to the SH3 domain of cortactin . In summary , the species cross - reactive mAb 4F11 efficiently inhibited the interaction of cortactin with F - actin . The mapping of the 4FI 1 epitope to the repeat region is con - sistent with the previous mapping of the F - actin binding se - quence to the same region . Regulation of the F - actin Binding Activity Since tyrosine phosphorylation is an important posttransla - tional modification of cortactin in both transformed and mitogen - stimulated cells , we tested the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on the binding of cortactin to F - actin ( Fig . 10 ) . Cell lysates from pp60s = - transformed CE cells were incubated with F - actin and subjected to sedimentation . The supernatant fraction ( lanes 2S ) and the solubilized pellet fraction ( lanes 2P and 3P ) were immunoblotted with either phosphotyrosine antibodies ( a ) or mAb 4F11 ( b ) . No cortac - tin was detected in the supernatant fraction by mAb 4Fll immunoblotting . To further test the partition of the tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin , the supernatant fraction of a paral - lel sedimentation was immunoprecipitated with mAb 4Fll and the immunocomplex was blotted with either phospho - tyrosine antibodies ( a , lane 3S ) or mAb 4Fll ( b , lane 3S ) . The majority of the tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin co - sedimented with F - actin ; no detectable tyrosine - phosphor - ylated cortactin was recovered from the supernatant fraction by anticortactin mAb immunopreeipitation ( a and b , lanes 3S ) . Since previous studies have shown that ~ 10 - 30 % of cortactin is phosphorylated on tyrosine in pp60sr ~ - trans - formed cells ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) , we conclude that , within the limit of the assay used , tyrosine phosphorylation does not al - ter cortactin binding to F - actin . Discussion Remodeling of the cellular actin / cytoskeletal network occurs in response to a variety of extracellular and intracellular sig - nals . In this paper we demonstrate that p80 / 85 , a substrate for activated forms of ppt0s ' L other src family protein tyro - sine kinases , and several growth factor receptor tyrosine ki - nases , is a filamentous actin - binding protein , p80 / 85 , which we have termed cortactin , is present in multiple cell types and is enriched in the submembranous cortical region of ad - herent cells . The F - actin - binding region within cortactin maps to a domain comprised of five or six copies of a tan - demly repeated sequence . Deletion of a highly conserved carboxyl - terminal SH3 domain , a structural motif common to many cytoskeleton - associated proteins , did not affect the binding of cortactin to F - actin . The F - actin - binding activity , its cortical localization , and tyrosine phosphorylation suggest that cortactin may play a role in mediating microfilament - membrane interactions in response to signals propagated by receptor and / or nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases . Cortactin Has a Specific , Saturable F - actin Binding Activity Cortactin from three separate sources , i . e . , CE cell lysates , programmed reticulocyte lysates or purified as a GST fusion protein from E . coli , bound specifically to polymerized actin in an F - actin cosedimentation assay . These data argue strongly for a direct interaction of cortactin with F - actin , and make it unlikely that the interaction with F - actin is mediated through another cellular protein present in the cortactin preparations . Although cortactin binds only to F - actin ( not to monomeric actin ; see below ) and binds efficiently to purified actin from several sources , at present , we can not rule out the possibility that the binding to polymerized actin may be mediated by another F - actin - binding protein present in the actin preparations . Using a GST - cortactin fusion protein produced in E . coli , we showed that the binding of cortactin to F - actin is satura - ble . We estimate that the stoichiometry of binding at satura - tion is * 1 GST . p80 protein per 14 actin monomers . A simi - lar stoichiometry has been reported for other actin - binding proteins , such as brain ot - actinin , macrophage actin - binding protein , and caldesmon ( Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ) . Analy - sis of the binding data yielded an apparent dissociation con - stant of / q = 0 . 43 5 = 0 . 08 / zM , a value similar to that reported for the actin - binding protein spectrin , ABP 120 , ~ actinin , and MARCKS ( Stossel et al . , 1985 ; Hartwig et al . , 1992 ) . Removal of the GST portion of the GST . p80 pro - tein by cleavage with thrombin increased the affinity of bac - terially expressed cortactin for F - actin by approximately twofold ( data not shown ) . To date , we have been unable to purify sufficient cortactin from CE cell lysates to perform ki - netic measurements similar to those carried out with E . coli - Wu and Parsons Cortactin , a Cortical Actin - binding Protein 1423 derived cortactin . Therefore it remains possible that post - translational modification of cortactin ( serine / threonine phosphorylation , or tyrosine phosphorylation , see below ) may directly alter the affinity or stoichiometry of cortactin binding to F - actin ( Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ; Hartwig et al . , 1992 ) . The Repeat Region , but Not the SH3 Domain of Cortactin , Is Responsible for F - actin Binding The evidence presented above indicates that the repeat re - gion of cortactin is both required and sufficient for F - actin binding . The amino acid sequences comprising the in - dividual repeats are highly conserved among each of the in - ternal repeats ( Fig . 1 d ) . Using both computer sequence analysis and visual inspection , we have been unable to iden - tify sequence similarities with known actin - binding proteins or reported actin - binding sequences ( Vanderkercldaove and Vancompernolle , 1992 ) . However , analysis of the secondary structure of the individual tandem repeats predicts an or - heli - cal region within the carboxyl - half of each repeat ( Fig . 1 d ) . Computer modeling of the helical region revealed that the highly conserved lysine residues can be positioned on the same face of the predicted a - helix , contributing to a posi - tively charged helical surface ( data not shown ) . Such a lysine - rich helix has been reported in several actin - binding proteins ( Friederick et al . , 1992 ; Vanderkerckhove and Van - compernolle , 1992 ) . Furthermore , the presence of the epi - tope for mAb 4Fll ( a mAb that blocks actin binding and recognizes cortactin from avian , rodent , primate , and inver - tebrate species ) in the repeat region suggests that this region of cortactin is likely to be exposed on the surface of the pro - tein and may be available for protein - protein interaction . Many F - actin - binding proteins also have monomeric actin - binding activity ( Stossel et al . , 1985 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ) . Cortactin was not retained on either a DNaseI affinity column or a DNaseI - actin affinity column , and thus does not appear to bind G - actin ( data not shown ) . Cortactin , present in several cell types , exhibits a charac - teristic colocalization with F - actin in the peripheral cortical region . In spite of its in vitro F - actin binding activity , little cortactin is observed to be associated with actin stress fibers . Several factors might explain the selective binding to cortical actin . For example , cortactin may bind specifically to an iso - form of actin present in the cortical region or interact with an F - actin - binding protein present ( or enriched ) in the cell cortex . Alternatively , the presence of a membrane localiza - tion signal in cortactin may target cortactin to the submem - branous region . The evidence discussed above shows that the carboxyl - terminal SH3 domain , a domain conserved in the src family of protein tyrosine ldnases as well as in several proteins with diverse cellular functions ( Pawson , 1988 ) is not directly involved in F - actin binding of cortactin . Several SH3 - containing proteins associate either directly or in - directly with the plasma membrane , including myosin I , PLC - % spectrin , fodrin , dlgA , and NADPH oxidase - associ - ated proteins ( for review see Roadway et al . , 1989 ) . Thus the SH3 domain in cortactin may serve as a localization signal to link cortactin to integral or peripheral membrane pro - teins . Cortactin , together with the proposed SH3 - binding proteins , may form complexes in the submembranous re - gion , participating in the interaction of microfilaments with the plasma membrane . Cortactin Is a Major ~ yrosine - phosphorylated F - actin - binding Protein in pp6O ~ Transformed Cells Previous studies have shown that cortactin becomes tyrosine phosphorylated to a high stoichiometry ( " o30 % of the total cortactin ) in ppt0 ' r ~ - transformed avian and rodent cells 0Vu et al . , 1991 ) , as well as in cells stimulated with EGE PDGE and colony stimulating factor I ( Downing and Rey - nolds , 1992 ; Maa et al . , 1992 ) . The data presented above in - dicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin does not influence F - actin binding . Therefore , the question remains how ( if at all ) tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin might influence the actin remodeling observed in src - transformed cells . Previous studies have shown that cortactin codistrib - utes with F - actin into podosomes in ppt0s ~ - transformed cells ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . pp60s ~ - transformed cells , in com - parison with untransformed cells , have a significant increase in the amount of actin in the Triton - insoluble cytoskeletal fraction ( Holme et al . , 1986 ) . This partitioning of actin into the cytoskeletal fraction is correlated with a change in filamentous actin assemblies from " stress fiber " pattern to punctative filament aggregates , podosomes ( Tarone et al . , 1985 ; Marchisio et al . , 1987 ) . Although the molecular mechanism for the codistribution of cortactin with F - actin aggregates in transformed cells remains unclear , several possibilities can be entertained . There is growing evidence for specific and stable interaction between phosphotyrosine - containing proteins and proteins with SI - I2 domains . While many such proteins have specific catalytic functions ( GTP - ase - activafing protein for p21 ~ , phospholipase C - y , ppt0 ' ~ ) , other proteins appear to function as " bridging " proteins ( crk , SHC , and GRB2 ) ( Mayer and Hanafusa , 1990 ; Cantley et al . , 1991 ; Koch et ai . , 1991 ; Lowenstein et al . , 1992 ; Pelicci et al . , 1992 ) . It is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin may promote its binding to cellular proteins con - taining SH2 domains . Thus increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin may induce aberrant cluster - ing / aggregation of cortactin - F - actin complexes with such proteins . Alternatively , tyrosine phosphorylation may affect the interaction of cortactin with F - actin by changing the binding affinity . Although such differences in binding have not been observed to date in our studies , the actin - binding properties of several proteins are affected by serine / threo - nine phosphorylation ; e . g . , MARCKS protein phosphory - lated by protein kinase C and caldesmon phosphorylated by pp34 cat2 kinase both exhibit a decreased affinity to micro - filaments ( Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ; Hartwig et al . , 1992 ) . Serine / threonine phosphorylation of cortactin is observed in normal and src - transformed cells and may be , along with tyrosine phosphorylation , an important regulatory signal ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Cortactin Has a Submembranous Localization in Cell Cortex Indirect immunofluorescent staining of multiple cell types with anticortactin mAbs revealed a strong staining of the cortical structures such as membranous ruffles and lamel - lipodia . The actin network present in the cell cortex is a more transitory and dynamic structure in comparison with stress fibers . The structure , and in turn the mechanical properties of this actin network , is determined by the interaction of vari - ous classes of actin - binding proteins with actin . Several actin - binding proteins are reported to be enriched in the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , 1993 1424 cell cortex , including filamin , villin , gelsolin , and ezrin ( Bretscher , 1991 ) . Many of these proteins are also regulated by cellular signals , such as Ca 2 § phospholipids , and pro - tein phosphorylation . The presence in the cell cortex of cor - tactin , an F - actin - binding protein that becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to ligand stimulation as well as in cellular transformation , makes cortactin an interesting candidate for a signal - transducing molecule or an effector molecule in the integration of extracellular stimulation with cytoplasmic changes . We note that cortactin is highly homol - ogous to the product of EMS1 , a gene located within the am - plified chromosome llq13 region in human carcinomas ( Schuuring et al . , 1992 ) . The EMS1 gene product , therefore , may be the human counterpart of avian cortactin . We thank S . J . Parsons , M . J . Weber , T . P . Bender , M . M . Smith , M . D . Schaller , D . C .
