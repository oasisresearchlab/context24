The symmetry - breaking cue for oocyte selection is provided 22 by the fusome , a tubular structure connecting all cells in the cyst . The Drosophila 23 spectraplakin Shot localises to the fusome and translates its asymmetry into a 24 polarised microtubule network that is essential for oocyte specification , but how Shot 25 recognises the fusome is unclear . Here we demonstrate that Shot’s actin - binding 26 domain ( ABD ) is necessary and sufficient to localise Shot to the fusome and 27 mediates Shot function in oocyte specification together with the microtubule - binding 28 domains . The calponin homology domain 1 ( CH1 ) of Shot’s ABD recognises fusomal 29 F - actin and requires CH2 to distinguish it from other forms of F - actin in the cyst . By 30 contrast , the ABDs of Utrophin , Fimbrin , Filamin , Lifeact and F - tractin do not 31 recognise fusomal F - actin . We therefore propose that Shot propagates fusome 32 asymmetry by recognising a specific conformational state of F - actin on the fusome . 33 34 35 36 Introduction 37 Both male and female gametes differentiate inside cysts of interconnected germ 38 cells . Whereas all male cells in the cyst become sperm , only one or few of the 39 female germ cells are specified to become oocytes in most animals ( Lu et al . , 2017 , 40 Pepling and Spradling , 1998 , Lei and Spradling , 2013 ) . Since cells in the female 41 germline cyst share cytoplasm through intercellular bridges , there must be specific 42 mechanisms to select the future oocyte . In Drosophila , a polarised microtubule ( MT ) 43 network extends throughout the cyst and directs the dynein - dependent transport of 44 oocyte fate determinants into one cell ( Theurkauf et al . , 1993 ; Li et al . , 1994 ) . A 45 similar mechanism could also be involved in oocyte specification in the mouse ( Lei 46 and Spradling , 2016 ; Niu and Spradling , 2022 ) . 47 48 In Drosophila , cyst formation and oocyte specification occur in the germarium at the 49 anterior of the fly ovary ( Fig . 1A ) . Oocyte determination starts when a germline stem 50 cell divides asymmetrically to produce a cyst progenitor , a cystoblast , that goes 51 through 4 rounds of incomplete division to produce a cyst of 16 cells connected by 52 intercellular bridges called ring canals ( de Cuevas et al . , 1997 ) . The cystoblast 53 contains a spherical structure inherited from the stem cell called the spectrosome , 54 which contains endoplasmic reticulum , spectrins and actin - binding proteins 55 ( Lighthouse et al . , 2008 ) . At each subsequent division , new spectrosomal material 56 forms in the ring canal connecting the two daughter cells and this fuses with the pre - 57 existing spectrosome to form the fusome , which becomes a branched structure 58 extending into all 16 cells of the cyst ( Lin et al . , 1994 ; De Cuevas and Spradling , 59 1998 ) . Because one cell inherits the original spectrosome / fusome from the 60 cystoblast , this cell contains more fusomal material than the others and this 61 ultimately specifies it as the pro - oocyte ( Lin and Spradling , 1995 ; De Cuevas and 62 Spradling , 1998 ) . 63 64 The first step in the translation of fusome asymmetry into oocyte specification is the 65 recruitment of the Drosophila spectraplakin , Shot ( Roper and Brown , 2004 ; 66 Nashchekin et al . , 2021 ) . Shot in turn recruits the MT minus end - binding protein 67 Patronin ( CAMSAP in mammals ) to the fusome , where Patronin stabilises 68 microtubule minus ends ( Goodwin and Vale , 2010 ; Jiang et al . , 2014 ; Nashchekin et 69 al . , 2021 ) . The slight excess of Patronin in the future oocyte is then amplified by the 70 dynein - dependent transport of Patronin and microtubule minus ends along the 71 stabilised microtubules into this cell , leading to the formation of non - centrosomal 72 microtubule - organising centres ( ncMTOCs ) in the future oocyte . Finally , these 73 ncMTOCs nucleate a polarised MT network that directs the transport of oocyte 74 determinants into this cell ( Grieder et al . , 2000 ; Bolívar et al . , 2001 ; Nashchekin et 75 al . , 2021 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . 76 77 The spectraplakin Shot belongs to a conserved family of actin - microtubule 78 crosslinkers that includes human Dystonin and MACF1 / ACF7 , which play important 79 roles in cytoskeletal organisation during neurogenesis and in epithelia ( Lee and 80 Kolodziej , 2002 ; Voelzmann et al . , 2017 ; Dogterom and Koenderink , 2018 ) . 81 Spectraplakins are characterised by an N - terminal actin - binding domain ( ABD ) , a 82 central long rod domain consisting of plakin and spectrin repeats and a C - terminal 83 MT - binding module ( Fig . 1C ) . The ABD of spektraplakins consists of tandem 84 calponin homology domains , CH1 and CH2 and the MT - binding module is composed 85 of the MT lattice - binding GAS2 domain and an unstructured C - terminal domain 86 containing two SxIP motifs that interact with the MT plus end - binding protein EB1 87 ( Sun et al . , 2001 ; Honnappa et al . , 2009 ; Applewhite et al . , 2010 ; Alves - Silva et al . , 88 2012 ) . Although Shot transmits fusome asymmetry to Patronin localisation and the 89 formation of the polarised MT network that specifies the oocyte , how Shot 90 recognises the fusome is not known . Previous work suggested that the Shot ABD is 91 not involved ( Roper and Brown , 2004 ) . Here we show , however , that both the actin 92 and MT - binding domains are required for oocyte specification , consistent with Shot ' s 93 role in organising the polarised microtubule network . The Shot ABD is necessary and 94 sufficient for localisation to the fusome and recognises a form of F - actin that differs 95 from other F - actin networks in the cyst . 96 97 Results and Discussion 98 The Shot actin - binding domain localises to the fusome 99 To determine which Shot domain ( s ) direct its localisation to the fusome , we 100 expressed a mini - version of Shot lacking the central rod domain , Shot - NC ( Figure 101 1C ) . It has been previously shown that the NC version of ACF7 ( a mammalian Shot 102 homologue ) partially substitutes for ACF7 function in cells ( Wu et al . , 2008 ) . Like 103 endogenous Shot and the full - length Shot transgene ( Fig . 1D and 1E , respectively ) , 104 Shot - NC localised to the fusome , which is marked by a - spectrin ( Fig . 1F and S1A ) . 105 Thus , the fusome - binding activity of Shot resides in either its N - or C - terminal 106 domains and the rod domain is dispensable for fusome localisation . Expression of 107 the N - or C - terminal domains alone showed that Shot - N binds to the fusome in wild 108 type and shot mutant cysts ( Fig . 1G and Fig . 2C , respectively ) , whereas Shot - C 109 forms cytoplasmic foci and accumulates in one cell of the cyst in wild - type ( Fig . S1A 110 and S1B ) but not in shot mutant cysts ( Fig . S1D ) , a pattern previously described for 111 EB1 ( Nashchekin et al . , 2021 ) . Live imaging of Shot - C - YFP in the germarium 112 revealed that it forms EB1 - like comets ( Video1 ) suggesting that the C - terminal 113 domain of Shot associates with MT plus ends , and that the MT lattice - binding GAS2 114 domain is in an inhibited conformation , as shown for the mammalian Shot 115 homologue , Dystonin , in Cos - 7 cells ( Kapur et al . , 2012 ) . Nevertheless , we decided 116 to test whether the GAS2 domain has the potential to bind the fusome by expressing 117 a portion of the Shot C - terminal domain containing the EF hand and the GAS2 118 domain that has strong MT binding activity ( Maybeck and Roper , 2009 ) . EF - GAS2 - 119 GFP localised to the fusome in the presence of endogenous Shot ( Fig . S1A and 120 S1B ) but failed to do so in shot mutant cysts ( Fig . S1C and S1D ) . Fusome - 121 associated MTs are largely lost in the absence of Shot , indicating that EF - GAS2 - 122 GFP localises to the fusome by binding to Shot - dependent MT ( Roper and Brown , 123 2004 ) . The GAS2 domain therefore cannot be responsible for the initial recruitment 124 of Shot to the fusome . 125 126 From our results so far , we speculated that Shot recruitment to the fusome requires 127 the Shot N - terminal region containing the two Calponin homology domains that 128 constitute the ABD . We therefore expressed a construct containing just the ABD of 129 Shot fused to GFP and confirmed its localisation to the fusome ( Fig . 1H and S1A ) . In 130 contrast , full - length Shot lacking the ABD ( Shot ∆ABD ) showed only a residual fusome 131 localisation ( Fig . 1I and S1A ) that disappeared in the absence of endogenous Shot 132 ( Fig . S1D ) like Shot C and Shot EF - GAS . Thus , the ABD of Shot is both necessary 133 and sufficient for fusome localisation , presumably by interacting with fusome - 134 associated F - actin . 135 136 The actin - and MT - binding domains of Shot are required for the oocyte 137 specification 138 139 The oocyte is not specified in the absence of Shot , leading to the formation of a 16 140 nurse cell follicle , but which domains of Shot are required for oocyte specification is 141 not known ( Roper and Brown , 2004 ) . The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element 142 binding factor oo18 RNA - binding protein ( Orb ) is an early marker for oocyte 143 specification that becomes concentrated in the oocyte in regions 2b and 3 in wild - 144 type germaria but it is uniformly distributed in shot null mutant cysts ( Lantz et al . , 145 1994 ; Roper and Brown , 2004 ) ( Fig . 2A and 2B ) . To determine whether the presence 146 of the Shot actin - or MT - binding domains are sufficient for oocyte specification , we 147 expressed Shot - N , Shot - C , Shot - NC and Shot - EF - GAS2 in shot null mutant cysts 148 ( Fig . 2C - D and S1D ) . Although Shot - N bound to the fusome in the absence of 149 endogenous Shot , it did not rescue Orb localisation and oocyte determination ( Fig . 150 2C ) . Neither Shot - C or Shot - EF - GAS2 localised to the fusome or rescued oocyte 151 specification in shot mutants ( Fig . Fig . S1C - D ) . However , Shot - NC expression 152 restored oocyte specification in the absence of full length Shot ( Fig . 2D ) . Thus , both 153 the ABD and MT - binding modules are necessary for Shot function during oocyte 154 determination , suggesting that Shot acts as an actin - microtubule cross - linker in this 155 context . 156 157 It has been previously reported that Shot’s ABD is not required for oocyte 158 specification , since the oocyte is specified normally in cysts mutant for shot kakp1 , a P - 159 element insertion that is predicted to prevent the expression of CH1 domain - 160 containing Shot isoforms ( Roper and Brown 2004 ) . As shown above , however , 161 Shot’s ABD is essential for the Shot localisation to the fusome and oocyte 162 determination . To resolve this contradiction , we tested the requirement for Shot’s 163 CH1 and CH2 domains in oocyte specification by expressing Shot ∆ABD , Shot ∆ABD - 164 LifeAct , Shot ∆CH1 and Shot ∆CH2 in shot mutant cysts ( Fig . 2E - F and S1D ) . Shot 165 truncations lacking the CH1 domain did not rescue oocyte specification , nor did 166 substituting the Shot ABD with the actin - binding activity of LiveAct ( Fig . 2E and 167 S1D ) . Only shot mutant cysts expressing Shot ∆CH2 maintained Orb localisation and 168 specified the oocyte ( Fig . 2F ) . Thus , the CH1 domain of Shot’s ABD is essential for 169 the oocyte specification . Since the shot kakp1 mutant does not affect oocyte 170 determination , we assume that this P - element insertion does not disrupt the 171 expression of CH1 - containing Shot isoforms in the germ line , although it does so in 172 somatic tissues ( Roper and Brown 2004 ) . 173 174 Previously , it has been proposed that Shot binds the fusome with an unidentified 175 domain and uses its GAS2 domain to bind and stabilise MT ( Roper and Brown , 176 2004 ) . Based on our results we propose an alternative model for Shot function in 177 oocyte determination where it works as a classical actin - MT cytolinker by recognising 178 fusomal F - actin with its ABD and using its C - terminal domain to attach MT to the 179 fusome . Which part of the MT module is involved in this process is an open question . 180 On the one hand , Shot - EF - GAS2 can recognise fusomal MT . On the other hand , 181 expression of the whole Shot C - terminal domain showed that the GAS2 domain is 182 not exposed and Shot C interacts only with MT plus ends through its EB1 - binding 183 motifs . Thus , Shot may guide the growth of MT plus ends along the fusome in a 184 similar manner to that described for ACF7 in migrating cells ( Kodama et al . , 2003 ; 185 Wu et al . , 2008 ) . The role of Shot in stabilising MT on the fusome could also be 186 indirect , since we recently showed that Shot is required for the fusome localisation of 187 the MT minus - end stabilising protein Patronin / CAMSAP ( Nashchekin et al . , 2021 ) . 188 Moreover , fusome - associated MT are unstable in patronin mutant cysts even though 189 Shot is still present . How Shot’s C - terminus recruits microtubules to the fusome will 190 therefore require further study . 191 192 Shot recognises a distinctive form of F - actin on the fusome 193 Several actin - binding proteins have been identified as components of the fusome , 194 including b - spectrin , Hts / Adducin , Tropomodulin and Shot ( De Cuevas et al . , 1996 ; 195 Lin et al . , 1994 ; Lighthouse et al . , 2008 ; Roper and Brown , 2004 ) . However , actin 196 has never been detected in the fusome and Phalloidin does not label the fusome , 197 staining only the ring canals and the cell cortex ( Warn et al . , 1985 and Fig . 1D - I ) . In 198 contrast , Actin - GFP weakly localises to the fusome , raising the possibility that the 199 absence of Phalloidin staining might be misleading ( Fig . S2A ) . We therefore tested 200 for the presence of endogenous actin in the fusome by performing antibody stainings 201 for actin using various fixation methods . Only a combination of heat fixation followed 202 by post - fixation with formaldehyde produced convincing fusomal actin staining ( Fig . 203 3A ) . As a control we used hts mutant cysts ( Fig . S2B ) , which lack the fusome ( Lin et 204 al . , 1994 ) , and confirmed that fusome - like actin staining was absent . We conclude 205 that the fusome does contain F - actin , but not in a form that can be detected by 206 Phalloidin . Since the Phalloidin - actin interaction is sensitive to the structure of F - actin 207 filaments ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) , fusomal F - actin may exist in a distinct 208 conformation that can be bound by the Shot ABD but not by Phalloidin . 209 210 Both b - Spectrin and Shot are members of a large family of actin - binding proteins 211 with ABDs formed by tandem CH domains ( Korenbaum and Rivero , 2002 ; Yin et al . , 212 2020 ) ( Fig . S2C ) . To test whether other CH domain proteins recognise fusomal F - 213 actin , we analysed the distribution of over - expressed Utrophin ABD and 214 endogenously - tagged Filamin and Fimbrin . None of these CH domain proteins 215 recognised fusomal F - actin and they mainly concentrated at the ring canals in fixed 216 and live samples ( Fig . 3B - D and S2D , respectively ) . F - tractin , LifeAct and SiR - actin 217 are other commonly used F - actin markers ( Melak et al . , 2017 ) , recognising a variety 218 of F - actin structures ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ; Schell et al . , 2001 ; Belin et al . , 2014 ; 219 Spracklen et al . , 2014 ; D ' Este et al . , 2015 ) . Neither F - tractin or LifeAct localised to 220 the fusome , mainly localising to the cell cortex and ring canals ( Fig . 3E - F and S2D ) . 221 Moreover , substituting Shot’s ABD with the LifeAct sequence ( Shot ∆ABD - LifeAct ) did 222 not restore fusome recognition to full - length Shot ( Fig . 3G and S1A ) . On the other 223 hand , SiR - actin weakly localised to the fusome ( Fig . 3H ) . Thus , fusomal F - actin has 224 a distinctive conformation that is only recognised by a subset of actin - binding 225 proteins / reagents . The Shot ABD must therefore have structural features that allow it 226 to bind preferentially to fusomal F - actin and to distinguish it from other F - actin 227 structures in the cyst . This does not preclude the Shot ABD binding to other forms of 228 F - actin , since Shot re - localises to the cell cortex and ring canals in hts and a - 229 spectrin mutant cysts that lack the fusome ( Lin and Spradling , 1995 ; De Cuevas et 230 al . , 1996 ) ( Fig . S3 ) . Shot also binds to actin filaments at the ring canals at the later 231 stages of oogenesis when the fusome is disassembled ( Lu et al . , 2021 ) . 232 233 The spatial arrangement of tandem CH1 and CH2 domains can regulate their actin 234 binding activity , as the CH2 domain can sterically block some of the actin binding 235 surfaces on the CH1 domain ( Bañuelos et al . , 1998 ; Galkin et al . , 2010 ; Iwamoto et 236 al . , 2018 ) . It has been proposed that phosphorylation of a conserved Tyr located at 237 the end of the CH2 domain facilitates the formation of an “open” conformation of the 238 ACF7 ABD and enhances F - actin binding ( Yue et al . , 2016 , Fig . 1C ) . To test whether 239 Shot binding to the fusome is regulated by Tyr phosphorylation , we expressed Shot 240 ABDs containing phosphomimetic and non - phosphorylatable versions of Tyr364 241 ( ABD Y364D and ABD Y364F , respectively ) . Whereas ABD Y364F only bound to 242 fusomal F - actin ( Fig . 4B ) , ABD Y364D bound to the fusome and ring canals in region 243 2a of the germarium and mostly relocalised to ring canals in region 2b ( Fig . 4A ) . This 244 suggests that shifting the equilibrium towards an open state of the CH domains alters 245 the specificity of Shot’s ABD for different forms of F - actin , rather than working as a 246 simple on / off switch . 247 248 To examine the role of CH2 in regulating the actin - binding properties of CH1 , we 249 compared the localisation of CH1 alone with that of the full ABD containing CH1 and 250 CH2 . Whereas CH1 - CH2 exclusively localised to the fusome ( Fig . 1H and 4C ) , CH1 251 alone recognised F - actin on the fusome and ring canals ( Fig . 4D ) . Thus , removing 252 the CH2 domain has the same effect as the Y364D mutation in making CH1 ' s 253 binding to F - actin more promiscuous . According to recent structural studies , CH1 - 254 CH2 binds to F - actin filaments in an open conformation , with CH1 sitting in the 255 groove between subdomains 1 and 2 of an actin monomer and CH2 oriented away 256 from the filament ( Galkin et al . , 2010 ; Iwamoto et al . , 2018 ; Kumari et al . , 2020 ) . This 257 implies that binding of CH1 to F - actin breaks multiple interactions between the CH1 258 and the CH2 ( Galkin et al . , 2010 ; Yue at al . , 2016 ; Iwamoto et al . , 2018 ; Harris et al . , 259 2019 ; Kumari et al . , 2020 ; Harris et al . , 2020 ) . We can envisage two models for how 260 CH2 controls the specificity of CH1 ' s actin binding . CH2 in the closed conformation 261 of the ABD may itself bind weakly to the specific form of actin on the fusome and 262 thereby increase the avidity of the initial interaction of CH1 - CH2 with fusomal actin . 263 This increased avidity would then ensure that the Shot ABD binds preferentially to 264 fusomal F - actin , which therefore outcompetes other F - actin in the cyst for Shot 265 binding . Alternatively , CH2 may mask some actin binding surfaces of CH1 in the 266 " closed " conformation of the ABD , allowing the latter to bind fusomal actin with 267 higher affinity than other forms of actin . In another words , the presence of CH2 may 268 increase the affinity of the ABD for fusomal actin or decrease its affinity to other 269 forms of actin . 270 271 Since isolated ABDs could behave differently from the full - length protein , we 272 introduced the Tyr364 mutations into Shot - NC and full - length Shot . Whereas the 273 Shot - NC Tyr364 mutants behave like the corresponding ABD mutants , the 274 localisation of the full - length Shot was not affected by the Y364D mutation ( Fig . 4E , 275 4F and S2E ) . Thus , sequences in the rod domain somehow restore the specificity of 276 the Y364D ABD for fusomal actin . We also tested the role each CH domain in the 277 context of the full - length protein by analysing the localisation of full - length Shot 278 lacking CH1 ( Shot ∆CH1 ) or CH2 ( Shot ∆CH2 ) . Shot D CH2 localised to the fusome normally 279 ( Fig . 4H and S1A ) , whereas deletion of CH1 abolished fusome binding , leading to 280 cytoplasmic localisation ( Fig . 4G and S1A ) . The same pattern was observed in the 281 absence of the endogenous Shot ( Fig . 2F and 2E , respectively ) . These results 282 indicate that the CH1 domain mediates Shot binding to the fusome and that it can 283 recognise a specific F - actin conformation that is invisible to several other CH - domain 284 proteins and actin - binding molecules . This result also implies that specific binding to 285 fusomal F - actin by Shot , which depends on CH2 in the isolated ABD , does not 286 require CH2 in the context of the full - length protein . 287 288 Structural studies on the interaction of CH domains with F - actin have revealed that 289 CH1 interacts with two adjacent actin monomers and is sensitive to the 290 torque / helicity of F - actin filaments ( Hanein et al . , 1998 ; Iwamoto et al . , 2018 ; Kumari 291 et al . , 2020 ; Harris et al . , 2020 ) . Changes in the helical twist of F - actin filaments can 292 be caused by mechanical tension , by interactions with actin - binding proteins ( Harris 293 et al . , 2018 ; Jégou and Romet - Lemonne , 2020 ; Harris et al . , 2020 ) , or by the 294 bending of F - actin filaments promoted by differences in the nucleotide states of actin 295 monomers ( Reynolds et al . , 2022 ; Oosterheert et al . , 2022 ) . It is therefore possible 296 that CH1 domains of different actin - binding proteins are predisposed to bind F - actin 297 filaments with specific helical twists , which could explain their distinct , but partly 298 overlapping localisation patterns ( Washington and Knecht , 2008 ; Harris et al . , 2020 ; 299 Jégou and Romet - Lemonne , 2021 ) . 300 301 Although the Y367D mutation and the removal of CH2 lead to promiscuous binding 302 of the Shot ABD to both the fusome and other F - actin in the cyst , they have no effect 303 on the specific localisation of full - length Shot to the fusome . This indicates that some 304 region of the full - length protein can substitute for CH2 in the " closed " conformation of 305 the ABD . This is most likely part of the rod domain since the Y367D mutation still 306 causes promiscuous actin binding in the context of ShotNC ( Fig . 4E ) . As proposed 307 for CH2 in the context of the ABD alone , this rescue by the rod domain could be due 308 to an interaction between the rod and CH1 that masks some actin binding surfaces 309 to reduce its affinity for nonfusomal actin . Since the rod is very long , it is also 310 possible that this effect is indirect and acts by allowing the intramolecular interaction 311 between the C - terminal EF hands and CH1 to achieve the same effect ( Applewhite 312 et al . , 2013 ) . Alternatively , the rod domain could increase the avidity of Shot ' s 313 interaction with the fusome by binding to some other fusomal component . Indeed , 314 Shot has been proposed to bind to a - Spectrin , which is enriched on the fusome 315 ( Khanal et al . , 2016 ; Lin et al . , 1994 ; De Cuevas and Spradling , 1998 ) . Since full - 316 length Shot D ABD does not localise to the fusome , the rod domain is unlikely function 317 as a strong fusome - binding domain itself , but may contribute to avidity in a similar 318 way to that proposed above for CH2 . 319 320 Our evidence suggests that fusome asymmetry is propagated to MT organisation in 321 the Drosophila female germline cyst by the formation of a distinct type of F - actin on 322 the fusome , which then recruits the spectraplakin Shot . How fusomal F - actin is 323 formed and the structural basis for its recognition by actin - binding proteins remain to 324 be determined . Considering that Shot is a conserved actin binding protein , it is 325 possible that a similar mechanism is used in other contexts where F - actin filaments 326 in a specific mechanical state are recognised by only a subset of actin - binding 327 proteins . 328 329 Material and methods 330331 Drosophila stocks .

To generate pUASP Shot - GFP , three fragments of the shot RE 353 cDNA were amplified from pUAST Shot - GFP ( Lee and Kolodziej , 2002 ) and cloned 354 together with EGFP into the pUASPattb vector . pUASPattb - Shot - NC - YFP was 355 generated by PCR amplifying fragments from pUAST Shot - GFP corresponding to 356 the first 520 aa ( Shot - N ) and last 462 aa ( Shot - C ) of Shot PE , cloning them together 357 into pUASP - YFP - Cterm and then re - cloning into pUASPattb . pUASPattb - Shot - N - 358 YFP and pUASPattb - Shot - C - YFP were generated by amplifying Shot - N or Shot - C 359 fragments from pUASPattb - Shot - NC - YFP and cloning them together with YFP into 360 pUASPattb . Shot ABD cDNA ( corresponding to 146 - 368 aa of Shot PE ) was 361 amplified from pUASPattb - Shot - NC - YFP and cloned together with EGFP into 362 pUASP - attb to generate pUASP - attb GFP - Shot ABD . The Q5 Site - Directed 363 Mutagenesis Kit ( New England BioLabs ) was used to generate pUASPattb - GFP - 364 Shot ABDY364F , pUASPattb - GFP - Shot ABDY364D , pUASPattb - Shot - NCY364D - 365 YFP and pUASPattb - Shot - NCY364F - YFP . Shot - N with the Y364F or Y364D 366 mutations was amplified from pUASPattb - Shot - NCY364F or pUASPattb - Shot - 367 NCY364D , respectively , and cloned together with two fragments covering the rest of 368 Shot RE cDNA and EGFP into pUASP - attb to generate pUASPattb - ShotY364F - GFP 369 and pUASPattb - ShotY364D - GFP . pUASP - LifeAct - tagRFP was generated according 370 to Riedl et al ( 2008 ) . NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly ( New England BioLabs ) was 371 used for most of the cloning . Primer sequences are available on request . 372 Immunohistochemistry . Ovaries were fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4 % 373 paraformaldehyde and 0 . 2 % Tween in PBS . Ovaries were then blocked with 1 % 374 BSA in PBS with 0 . 2 % Tween for 1 hr at room temperature . Ovaries were incubated 375 with the primary antibody for 16 hr with 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS with 0 . 2 % Tween at 4C° 376 and for 4 hr with the secondary antibody at room temperature . For detection of 377 fusomal F - actin , we used the heat fixation protocol described in Chen et al ( 2018 ) 378 with some modifications . Ovaries were dissected in PBS , fixed for 10 sec in hot 379 ( 95C° ) 1xTSS ( 0 . 03 % Triton X - 100 , 4 g / L NaCl ) , post - fixed in 8 % paraformaldehyde 380 and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then treated as 381 above . We used the following primary antibodies : guinea pig anti - Shot at 1 : 1000 382 ( Nashchekin et al . , 2016 ) , mouse anti - Orb at 1 : 10 ( DSHB Hybridoma Products 4H8 383 and 6H4 . Deposited to the DSHB by Schedl , P ) , mouse anti - a - Spectrin at 1 : 200 384 ( DSHB Hybridoma Product 3A9 . Deposited to the DSHB by Branton , D . / Dubreuil , 385 R . ) , mouse anti - Actin at 1 : 200 ( clone AC - 40 , Merck ) , rabbit anti - b - spectrin at 1 : 200 386 ( Byers et al . , 1989 ) , SiR - actin ( 1 : 100 , Spirochrome ) . Secondary antibodies 387 conjugated with Alexa fluor dyes ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were used at 1 : 1000 . 388 Imaging . Fixed preparations were imaged using a Leica SP8 ( 63x / 1 . 4 HC PL Apo 389 CS Oil ) confocal microscope . Germaria were imaged by collecting 10 – 15 z sections 390 spaced 0 . 5 µm apart . For live imaging , ovaries were dissected and imaged in 391 Voltalef oil 10S ( VWR International ) on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope ( 63x / 1 . 4 392 HCX PL Apo CS Oil ) or on an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with a Yokogawa 393 CSU22 spinning disk confocal imaging system ( 100x / 1 . 3 NA Oil UPlanSApo ) . 394 Images were collected with Leica LAS AF software or MetaMorph and processed 395 using ImageJ . The images are projections of several z sections . 396 Reproducibility of experiments and statistical analyses . Images are 397 representative examples from at least three independent repeats for each 398 experiment . The number of shot 3 mutant cysts ( region 2b to 3 ) with restored Orb 399 localisation after the expression of a rescue transgene were as follows : Figure 2A 400 wild type cysts ( 50 / 50 ) , Figure 2B shot 3 mutant cysts without a transgene ( 0 / 30 ) , 401 Figure 2C Shot N ( 0 / 21 ) , Figure S1D Shot - C ( 0 / 28 ) , Figure S1D Shot EFGAS ( 0 / 18 ) , 402 Figure 2D Shot NC ( 25 / 26 ) , Figure S1D Shot ∆ABD ( 0 / 14 ) , Figure S1D Shot - LifeAct 403 ( 0 / 19 ) , Figure 2E Shot ∆CH1 ( 0 / 16 ) , Figure 2F Shot ∆CH2 ( 21 / 21 ) . The number of cysts 404 analysed to determine the localisation of various Shot transgenes and actin - binding 405 reagents is summarised in Table S1 . The chi - square test was used to test whether 406 values were significantly different between wild type and shot 3 mutant cysts . The 407 Mann - Whitney t - test was used to determine significance when measuring the co - 408 localisation of Shot transgenes and fusome . A level of p < 0 . 01 was considered to be 409 statistically significant . No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample 410 size , the experiments were not randomized , and the investigators were not blinded to 411 allocation during experiments and outcome assessment . 412 Supplemental material 413 Figures S1 - S3 , Video 1 and Table S1 . 414 415 416 Acknowledgements 417 We are grateful to Jean - René Huynh , Christian Klämbt , Thomas Lecuit , Katja Röper 418 and the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center ( NIH P40OD018537 ) for fly stocks , 419 the Gurdon Institute Imaging Facility for assistance with microscopy , John Overton 420 for technical assistance in making transgenic flies .
