Coﬁlin , one of three ABPs that precisely choreograph actin assembly and orga - nization into comet tails that drive motility in vitro [ 2 ] , binds and stochastically severs aged ADP actin ﬁlament segments of de novo growing actin ﬁlaments [ 3 ] . Deﬁciencies in meth - odologies to track in real time the nucleotide state of actin ﬁlaments , as well as coﬁlin severing , limit the molecular understanding of coupling between actin ﬁlament chemical and mechanical states and severing . We engineered a ﬂuo - rescently labeled coﬁlin that retains actin ﬁlament binding and severing activities . Because coﬁlin binding depends strongly on the actin - bound nucleotide , direct visualization of ﬂuorescent coﬁlin binding serves as a marker of the actin ﬁlament nucleotide state during assembly . Bound coﬁlin allosterically accelerates P i release from unoccupied ﬁla - ment subunits , which shortens the ﬁlament ATP / ADP - P i cap length by nearly an order of magnitude . Real - time visu - alization of ﬁlament severing indicates that fragmentation scales with and occurs preferentially at boundaries between bare and coﬁlin - decorated ﬁlament segments , thereby controlling the overall ﬁlament length , depending on coﬁlin binding density . Results and Discussion Direct Visualization of ADF / Coﬁlin Binding to Growing Actin Filaments To follow in real time ADF / coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments , we engineered a yeast ADF / coﬁlin mutant that could be speciﬁ - cally labeled with a ﬂuorescent probe . Yeast ADF / coﬁlin contains a single cysteine residue that is buried in the protein structure , so we substituted D34 , a solvent - exposed amino acid residue positioned outside of the actin - binding site [ 4 ] , to cysteine ( Figure 1A ) and labeled with Alexa - 488 maleimide ( Figure 1B ) . Labeled D34C ADF / coﬁlin retains strong actin ﬁla - ment binding ( see Figure S1A available online ) , severing ( dis - cussed forthcoming ) , and acceleration of spontaneous actin assembly activities ( Figure S1B ) . Given the minimal perturba - tions of substitution and labeling , Alexa - 488 - labeled ADF / coﬁlin is a reliable tool to investigate the dynamic interaction with elongating actin ﬁlaments . We followedin realtime usingtotalinternalreﬂectionﬂuores - cence microscopy ( TIRFm ) the interaction of ADF / coﬁlin with actin ﬁlaments as they spontaneously assembled from Alexa 568 - labeled ATP - actin monomers ( Figures 1C and 1E ) . Measurements were done in the presence of proﬁlin to foster nucleotide exchange from actin monomers , thereby maintain - ing an ATP - actin monomer pool [ 5 ] and limiting ADF / coﬁlin binding to monomers in solution . The cumulative ﬂuorescence of labeled actin in the evanescent ﬁeld ( proportional to polymer mass ) increaseslinearlyovertime ( Figure1E ) , yieldingaﬁlament elongation rateof z 5 subunits s 2 1 ( Figure 1E ) in theabsence of ADF / coﬁlin , consistent with previous determinations [ 6 ] . Using two - color TIRFm , we simultaneously monitored in real time actin ﬁlament assembly and ADF / coﬁlin binding ( Figures 1D and 1F and Movie S1 ) . The density of bound ADF / coﬁlin scales with the increase in total polymer ( Figure 1F ) . Remark - ably , we detect only minor ADF / coﬁlin ﬂuorescence before 170 s of actin assembly at the TIRFm resolution scale ( Fig - ure 1D ) , demonstrating that ADF / coﬁlin binding is delayed relative to actin polymerization , presumably because of the nucleotide state of ﬁlament subunits [ 5 ] . Bound ADF / Coﬁlin Dissociates Slowly from Actin Filaments ThelifetimeanddissociationkineticsofboundADF / coﬁlinwere evaluated by ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . A deﬁned segment of an Alexa - 488 - ADF / coﬁlin - deco - rated ﬁlament was photobleached with an intense laser beam ( Figure 2A , white box ) . Surprisingly , minimal ﬂuorescence recovery associated with alexa - 488 - ADF / coﬁlin occurs within 500 s , indicating that the rate constant for yeast ADF / coﬁlin dissociation from ﬁlaments is very slow and negligible over the time courses of experimental visualization ( Figure 2B and Movie S2 ) . Locally bleached actin ﬁlaments elongate and bind Alexa - 488 - ADF / coﬁlin , thereby conﬁrming that neither actin norADF / coﬁlinarelimiting ( Figure2A , greenbox , andFigure2C ) and that the lack of ADF / coﬁlin recovery after photobleaching ( Figures 2A and 2B ) reﬂects slow ADF / coﬁlin dissociation . To ensure that slow yeast ADF / coﬁlin dissociation is not a consequence of labeling or photobleaching procedures , we competed bound unlabeled ADF / coﬁlin with Alexa - labeled ADF / coﬁlin ( Figure 2E and Movie S2 ) . Undetectable levels of Alexa - ADF / coﬁlin incorporate into actin ﬁlaments decorated with unlabeled ADF / coﬁlin ﬁlaments within 800 s ( Figure 2E ) , thereby conﬁrming that slow ADF / coﬁlin dissociation is an intrinsicbiochemical propertyofyeastADF / coﬁlinthatcontrib - utes to a high overall binding afﬁnity [ 7 ] . Note that Alexa - 488 - ADF / coﬁlin binds rapidly to bare actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 2D and Movie S2 ) . ADF / Coﬁlin Shortens the ATP / ADP - P i Cap Length of Actin Filaments by Allosterically Accelerating P i Release ADF / coﬁlin binds 40 - fold more strongly to ADP - actin ﬁla - ment subunits than to ATP or ADP - P i subunits and weakens * Correspondence : enrique . delacruz @ yale . edu ( E .

Labeled ADF / coﬁlin therefore serves as an effective marker to directly probe thenucleotidecompositionofindividualactinﬁlaments . TIRFm reveals that ADF / coﬁlin does not decorate ﬁlament barbed end segments , even at high ADF / coﬁlin concentration ( Figure 3A , middle and bottom , and Movie S3 ) , which we interpret as weak binding to ATP / ADP - P i cap at ﬁlament barbed ends ( Fig - ure 3A ) . We note that the ﬁlament is comprised predominantly of ADP - P i subunits at these actin concentrations and in the absence of ADF / coﬁlin ( Figure3A , top ; [ 8 , 9 ] ) , to whichADF / co - ﬁlin binds very weakly [ 5 , 10 ] . ADF / coﬁlin must therefore accel - erate P i release from ﬁlaments , as reported for assays done with bulk ﬁlament populations [ 5 ] , to decorate with such high efﬁciency ( Figure3A , middleandbottom ) . Inaddition , observa - tion of multiple ADF / coﬁlin clusters along individual actin ﬁla - ments favors a random ATP hydrolysis mechanism for ﬁlament subunits over a vectorial mechanism ( Movie S1 and Movie S3 ) . Because the ATP / ADP - P i cap size can be limited both by slowADF / coﬁlinbinding [ 11 , 12 ] and / orbytherateofP i release , we investigated the variation in cap length as a function of ADF / coﬁlin and actin monomer concentrations . Statistical analysis reveals that the mean cap length depends on the ADF / coﬁlin concentration , reaching a minimum of 1 . 6 m m at A B 66 . 2 45 35 25 18 . 4 14 . 4 680 sec 425 sec 170 sec C 425 sec 680 sec 170 sec D U .

Alexa - 568 - actin ﬁlaments were colored in red , Alexa - 488 - ADF / coﬁlin in green , and the decorated portions of ﬁlaments in yellow in the merged images ( D ) . White arrow - heads indicate the fast - growing barbed ends of ﬁlaments .

Scale bars represent 5 m m . saturating concentration of ADF / coﬁlin and in the presence of 0 . 8 m M actin ( Fig - ure 3B ) . Higher ADF / coﬁlin concentra - tions do not shorten the cap length ( Fig - ure 3B ) , which remains stationary over time , whereas the aged zone of the ﬁla - ment is decorated with ADF / coﬁlin ( Figure S1C ) . A kinetic model in which the nucleo - tide - linked equations of actin ﬁlament nucleation , elongation , random ATP hydrolysis , P i release , and ADF / coﬁlin binding are explicitly accounted for was used to ﬁt the experimental cap length data ( Figures 3B and 3C and Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . The ADF / coﬁlin concentration dependence of the cap length is well described by a model in which bound ADF / coﬁlin increases P i release from ADP - P i subunits by an order of magnitude from 0 . 0019 s 2 1 to 0 . 013 s 2 1 ( Figure 3B ; [ 5 ] ) . The ﬁt to the data , however , is signiﬁcantly improved if accelera - tion of P i release is propagated allosterically from ADF / coﬁlin - occupied sites to R 10 vacant subunits along the ﬁla - ment ( i . e . , nonnearest neighbor effects ) , as predicted from long - range effects on ﬁlament subunit torsional dynamics [ 13 ] . The actin ﬁlament ATP / ADP - P i cap size ( at a given actin concentration ) is determined by the maximum P i release rate constant , even though it is accelerated allosterically by ADF / coﬁlin binding . This behavior predicts that the cap length increases linearly with actin concentration and also with inclu - sion of P i in the medium , as is observed ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . Similarly , if ﬁlament barbed end elongation is stopped with capping protein , the ATP / ADP - P i cap disappears and ADF / coﬁlin decorates the entire ﬁlament ( Figure S1D ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that the ATP / ADP - P i cap length reﬂects a tight balance between ﬁlament elongation , random ATP hydrolysis , ADF / coﬁlin binding , and allosteric acceleration of P i release from vacant ﬁlament subunits .

ADF / coﬁlin binding alters the average structure [ 15 , 16 ] and dynamics [ 7 , 13 , 17 , 18 ] of actin ﬁlaments such that they are Figure 3 . Tight Coupling between Binding and Effect on Nucleotide State of Actin Filaments Modulates ADF / Coﬁlin - Actin Interaction ( A ) 0 . 8 m M Alexa - 568 - actin monomers were polymerized in the presence of 2 . 4 m M proﬁlin and ADF / coﬁlin , as indicated .

Visualization of Coﬁlin Interaction with Actin 865 more ﬂexible than native ﬁlaments ( Figure S2A and [ 18 , 19 ] ) . It is hypothesized that shear stress associated with thermal - induced ﬂuctuations accumulates locally at boundaries of mechanical asymmetry , thereby leading to preferential severing at junctions of bare and decorated ﬁlament segments [ 3 , 12 , 14 , 19 , 20 ] . To test the prediction of preferential severing at bound - aries of bare and decorated segments , we quantiﬁed the severing events occurring during spontaneous assembly of ATP - actin ﬁlaments . Line scans of ﬂuorescence intensity along actin ﬁlaments reveal that fragmentation is statistically favored at sites of low ADF / coﬁlin binding density and occurs exclusively outside the ATP / ADP - P i cap ( Figures 4A – 4C ) . Note that severing is not obligatory with ADF / coﬁlin binding , but the frequency of severing events correlates with the position ( Figures 4A and 4B ) and density ( Figure 4D ) of bare and ADF / coﬁlin - decorated boundaries , consistent with preferential severing at or near these boundaries on ﬁlaments ( Movie S4 ) . Concluding Remarks ADF / Coﬁlin Modulates the Nucleotide Composition of Growing Actin Filaments The age and stability of actin ﬁlaments is linked to the chemical state of the bound adenine nucleotide . ATP bound to mono - mers is rapidly hydrolyzed after incorporation into ﬁlaments such that freshly polymerized ﬁlaments are comprised of subunits with bound ATP or ADP - P i , whereas older ﬁlament subunits release P i slowly and have bound ADP . The actin - binding activities of many actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) including ADF / coﬁlin are sensitive to the chemical state of the actin - bound nucleotide , so the ﬁlament nucleotide compo - sition dramatically inﬂuences the organization , stability , and dynamics of cellular actin - based structures . ADF / coﬁlin ages ﬁlaments by accelerating P i release over an order of magnitude . This effect is allosteric and propagates to distal sites unoccupied by ADF / coﬁlin , presumably through allosteric modulation of ﬁlament twist and dynamics [ 13 , 21 , 22 ] . Therefore , a kinetic competition between monomer addi - tion , intrinsic random ATP hydrolysis [ 23 ] and P i release [ 5 ] , ADF / coﬁlin binding [ 5 , 11 , 12 ] , and allosteric ADF / coﬁlin - medi - ated acceleration of P i release ( Figure 3B ) exists during assembly and network growth . P i release , though accelerated allosterically by ADF / coﬁlin , remains considerably slower than ﬁlament elongation ( up to 500 subunits s 2 1 ) at high in vivo actin concentrations , which yields a large ﬁlament ATP / ADP - P i cap ( w 100 m m in length ) that precludes ADF / coﬁlin binding and severing . Even if the P i release is faster for yeast actin [ 24 ] , this behavior is difﬁcult to reconcile with the observation that ADF / coﬁlin binds growing cellular ﬁlaments only 0 . 2 – 1 m m away from their nucle - ation sites [ 25 – 27 ] . We favor a mechanism in which ﬁlament barbed ends must be rapidly capped ( to stop rapid elongation ) for signiﬁcant ADF / coﬁlin binding to occur . Such a mechanism Figure 4 . ADF / Coﬁlin Severing Occurs between Regions of Bare and ADF / Coﬁlin - Decorated Actin Filaments ( A ) The polymerization of 0 . 5 m M Alexa - 568 - actin monomers in the presence of 1 . 5 m M proﬁlin and 0 . 3 m M Alexa - 488 - coﬁlin was followed by TIRFm . The distribution of Alexa - 568 - actin and Alexa - 488 - coﬁlin along the ﬁlament was quantiﬁed using line scans of their respective ﬂuorescence ( dashed line ) . Fluorescence signals were colored as in Figure 1 . The arrowheads ( orange ) indicate the position of the actin ﬁlament’s severing site , barbed end ( white ) , and pointed end ( blue ) . Scale bars represent 2 m m . ( B ) The histogram quantiﬁed the frequency of fragmentation events as a function of the ratio of Alexa - 488 - ADF / coﬁlin over actin ﬁlament . ( C ) Statistics of the Alexa - 488 - ADF / coﬁlin ﬂuo - rescence ratio , calculated as in ( B ) , along frag - mented ﬁlaments , which were centered on their fragmentation site ( red line ) . The curves give the average of the ﬂuorescence ratio ( n = 28 ) for 0 . 5 m M ( black ) , 0 . 9 m M ( blue ) , and 2 . 8 m M Alexa - 488 - ADF / coﬁlin ( green curve ) . ( D ) ADF / coﬁlin severing activity ( red dots for labeled ADF / coﬁlin and black dots for unlabeled ADF / coﬁlin ) scaleswiththedensityofboundaries between bare and ADF / coﬁlin - decorated ﬁla - ment segments ( solid line ) . The ADF / coﬁlin binding density ( coﬁlins bound per actin subunit ) and the fractional site density of boundaries between bare and ADF / coﬁlin - decorated segments ( solid line ) were calculated from the Alexa - 488 - labeled ADF / coﬁlin or unlabeled ADF / coﬁlin binding parameters , determined in equilibrium binding measurements ( Figure S1A ; [ 20 ] ) . The boundary density reaches a maximum of w 22 % total sites at w 50 % ﬁlament occupancy . Current Biology Vol 21 No 10 866 would account for colocalization of ADF / coﬁlin and capping protein in actin networks [ 26 ] and modulation of ADF / coﬁlin severing efﬁciency by capping protein . Subsequent ADF / coﬁlin binding to stochastically emerging ADP subunits of capped ﬁlaments allosterically accelerates P i release , thereby promoting Arp2 / 3 complex dissociation [ 10 ] and network re - modeling . Therefore , although ADF / coﬁlin - mediated accelera - tion of P i release minimally affects the ATP / ADP - P i cap length of rapidly elongating ﬁlaments in vivo , it rapidly ages ﬁlaments and networks by allosterically accelerating P i release once they are capped and stop elongating . ADF / Coﬁlin Preferentially Severs ADP - Actin Filaments at Boundaries of Bare and Coﬁlin - Decorated Segments Quantitative analysis of ﬁlament binding [ 5 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 20 , 28 ] and severing [ 3 , 29 , 30 ] indicates that ADF / coﬁlin severing activity scales with the density of boundaries between bare and ADF / coﬁlin - decorated ﬁlament segments [ 14 ] . It has been hypothesized that asymmetry originating from disconti - nuities in ﬁlament topology and mechanics ( i . e . , bending and twisting elasticity ) generates a local accumulation of shear stress [ 19 ] , thereby leading to preferential fragmentation at or near these boundaries [ 14 ] . This hypothesis relies on three important observations : ( 1 ) severing occurs at low ADF / coﬁlin binding densities and small cluster sizes [ 20 , 29 , 30 ] ; ( 2 ) coﬁlin - decorated ﬁlaments display signiﬁcantly different mechanical properties from bare ﬁlaments [ 13 , 18 , 19 ] ; ( 3 ) partially ADF / coﬁlin - decorated ﬁlaments are considerably less stable than bare or ADF / coﬁlin - saturated ﬁlaments [ 21 , 22 ] . The prediction that ADF / coﬁlin - mediated severing occurs at bare and decorated boundaries lacks direct proof and is best evaluated by direct , real - time visualization of ADF / coﬁlin binding and ﬁlament severing , as performed in this study . Severing is not obligatory with ADF / coﬁlin binding , but the frequency of severing events scales with the boundary density and also occurs at or near these boundaries . These observa - tions lend credence to the hypothesis that shear stress accu - mulates at a mechanical asymmetry presented at boundaries of bare and ADF / coﬁlin - decorated ﬁlament segments , thereby promoting severing . A challenge for future investigations will be to determine how other actin - binding proteins , including coronin and AiP1 [ 31 ] , modulate this mechanism to promote actin disassembly .
