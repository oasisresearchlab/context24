Introduction Ovarian cancer is one of the most common lethal gynecologic malignancy with the third morbidity rate and the first mortality rate . According to the cancer sta - tistics , there are estimated approximately 200 , 000 new cases of ovarian cancer every year , with about 150 , 000 deaths attributed to the disease [ 1 ] all over of the world . Although the 5 years survival rate after early surgery is up to 80 - 90 , 70 % of the patients still have poor prog - nosis because it is usually diagnosed at advanced stages [ 2 ] . Surgery combined with cisplatin chemotherapy is the main treatment for malignant ovarian tumors . Most of the women diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer will benefit from this treatment [ 3 ] . The pharmacological work of cisplatin is mediated by DNA binding , which can cause DNA damage , hinder DNA replication and induce cell death [ 4 ] . Unfortunately , the patients will be resistant to cisplatin - based chemotherapy after several cycles of treatment . Patients with cisplatin resistance usually have no responses to other chemotherapy drugs , and their non - progression lifetime is approximately 3 - 4 months with a median survival for less than 1 year . Therefore , it is urgent to elucidate the mechanism of cisplatin resistance and discover new therapeutic targets in the treatment of ovarian cancer . Threonine and tyrosine kinase ( TTK ) , an integral part of the spindle assembly checkpoint , works as a monitor mechanism for ensuring chromosomal sepa - ration [ 5 ] . High expression levels of TTK could result in the subsequent development of aneuploid tumors Open Access * Correspondence : zh19841207xx @ 163 . com ; renquanlu @ fudan . edu . cn † Yixuan Liu and Keyu Zhu contributed equally to this work . 1 Department of Clinical Laboratory , Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center , No . 270 , Dong’An Road , Xuhui District , Shanghai 200032 , China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 10 Liu et al . J Ovarian Res ( 2021 ) 14 : 128 [ 6 ] . It has been reported that TTK is a predictor of poor prognosis in breast , lung , brain and colorec - tal cancer [ 7 ] . Meanwhile , recent studies have shown that TTK could mediate multiple drug resistance in lung cancer [ 1 ] . However , there was little informa - tion available regarding its role in ovarian cancer and cisplatin - resistance . In this study , cisplatin - resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780 ( A2780cis ) was established to explore the relationship between TTK expression and cisplatin - resistance . We clarified the mechanism of cisplatin - resistance through knockdown or inhibition of TTK expression . Furthermore , the related signaling path - ways activated by TTK in cisplatin - resistant cell line were analyzed by RNA - sequencing ( RNA - seq ) . The conclusions from cell experiments were further verified in ovarian cancer tissues . Thus , TTK may be a potential therapeutic target in patients with platinum - resistant ovarian cancer . Results TTK was up‑regulated in cisplatin‑resistant ovarian cancer cell line Cisplatin - resistant A2780 cell line was induced through continuous stimulation with cisplatin in vitro . A2780 cells were seeded in 6 - well plate at 70 - 80 % confluence and treated with 1 μg / mL cisplatin for 2 days . After 2 days’ culture , the cells were washed with PBS and recov - ered in medium without drug treatment for another 2 days . The above procedure was repeated for at least 4 - 6 weeks with gradually increased concentration of cis - platin ( Fig . 1A ) . Then , we acquired a cisplatin - resistant A2780 cell line which could grow well in culture medium containing 10 μg / mL cisplatin . This cell line was named A2780cis . The cell viability was assayed after the treat - ment with 2 - fold increasing concentrations of cisplatin for 48 h . The IC50 values of A2780 and A2780cis cells were 3 . 253 μg / mL and 10 . 58 μg / mL respectively ( Fig . 1B ) . Therefore , A2780cis cell line is cisplatin - resistant and can Fig . 1 A The induction process of cisplatin - resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780cis . B IC50 values of cisplatin in A2780 and A2780cis cells were analyzed by CCK - 8 assay . The cisplatin concentrations used were as follows : 1 μg / mL , 2 μg / mL , 4 μg / mL , 8 μg / mL , 16 μg / mL , 32 μg / mL , 64 μg / mL , 128 μg / mL Page 3 of 10 Liu et al . J Ovarian Res ( 2021 ) 14 : 128 tolerate more than three times higher concentration of cisplatin compared with parental A2780 cells . We found that the expression of TTK was increased in A2780cis cells at mRNA and protein levels ( Fig . 2 ) . Down‑regulation of TTK expression could recover the sensitivity of A2780cis cells to cisplatin We found that the expression of TTK was increased in A2780cis cells at mRNA and protein levels ( Fig . 2 ) . To explore the relationship between TTK and cisplatin - resistance , TTK expression was down - regulated in A2780cis cells , and the knockdown efficiency was veri - fied by Western blot and real - time PCR ( Fig . 3A ) . As shown in Fig . 3B , knockdown of TTK protein inhib - ited the proliferation of A2780cis cells , and the influ - ence was more obvious when the cells treated with cisplatin in culture medium . DNA synthesis detection by EdU ( 5 - Ethynyl − 2 ′ - deoxyuridine ) staining also showed that the proliferation of A2780cis cells was suppressed after the down - regulation of TTK - . Espe - cially , knockdown of TTK could improve the cispl - atin - sensitivity of A2780cis cells ( Fig . 3C ) . Meanwhile , down - regulation of TTK in A2780cis cells reduced the quantities of cell colony and promoted cell apoptosis . Moreover , TTK inhibitor could function the same as TTK knockdown ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Therefore , we indicated that down - regulation or inhibition of TTK expression would suppress cell proliferation and increase cisplatin sensitivity of A2780cis cells . TTK inhibition relieved the resistance of A2780cis cells to cisplatin by inhibiting PI3K / AKT pathway The related signaling pathways activated by TTK were analyzed through RNA - seq . According to gene count and P value enriched by KEGG , we found the top 10 path - ways differentially expressed in A2780cis cells with or without TTK knockdown ( Fig . 4A ) . Among them , PI3K / AKT signaling pathway was reported to participate in cisplatin - resistance of ovarian cance [ 8 ] . Actually , both p - PI3K and p - AKT were up - regulated in A2780cis cells , suggesting that PI3K / AKT signaling pathway was acti - vated when the cells were resistant to cisplatin ( Fig . 4B ) . Thus , we guessed that TTK mediated cisplatin - resistance through activating the PI3K / AKT signaling pathway . As shown in Fig . 4B , knockdown of TTK could inhibit the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT in A2780cis cells . The inhibitor of TTK or PI3K could significantly suppress the activation of the PI3K / AKT pathway and enhanced the cisplatin sensitivity of A2780cis cells ( Fig . 4C , D ) . These results proved that TTK facilitated proliferation of cis - platin - resistant cells by activating PI3K / AKT signaling pathway . Fig . 2 The up - regulation of TTK in cisplatin - resistant cell line was verified by A western blot and B quantitative real - time PCR compared with parental cells . * * * P < 0 . 001 Page 4 of 10 Liu et al . J Ovarian Res ( 2021 ) 14 : 128 TTK was highly expressed in the tissues of ovarian cancer patients with cisplatin‑resistance Data from Oncomine ( http : / / www . oncom ine . org / ) indi - cated that TTK was overexpressed in most types of can - cer tissues than in normal tissues ( Fig . 5A ) . We verified that the protein expression of TTK in ovarian tumor tis - sues was indeed higher than in normal controls by way of microarray chips - ( P < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 5B , Table 1 ) . We fur - ther explored the expression of TTK in cisplatin - resistant ovarian cancer patients . Ovarian tumor tissues from 20 ovarian cancer patients were collected both before and after the cisplatin - resistance acquisition . We found that cisplatin - resistant tissues showed stronger TTK expres - sion than the cisplatin - sensitive ones ( Fig . 6 , Table 2 ) . Therefore , TTK may be a tumor promoter and cisplatin - resistance associated factor . Discussion Combination of surgery and cisplatin - based chemo - therapy is the gold standard for the treatment of ovarian cancer . However , after short - term treatment , cisplatin resistance often occurs , which greatly weakened the ther - apeutic effect [ 9 ] . Cellular resistance to cisplatin occur through multiple mechanisms which can be divided into the following categories : a ) reducing cross - linking in the DNA chain , such as preventing the drug intake and accelerating the drug efflux [ 10 – 12 ] . b ) increasing the efficiency of DNA repair [ 13 ] . c ) promoting cell survival through changing the signaling pathway that affects the tumor apoptosis [ 14 , 15 ] . However , the key factors asso - ciated with chemotherapy resistance still need to be explored . The protein kinase TTK ( also known as Monopolar spindle 1 , Mps1 ) , a dual specificity kinase , is involved in the formation of mitotic checkpoint complex , regulation of cytokinesis , response to DNA damage , and facilitation of proper chromosome alignment [ 16 ] . TTK is hardly Fig . 3 Knockdown of TTK expression in cisplatin - resistant cells would suppress cell proliferation and increase the drug sensitivity to cisplatin .

E Down - regulation of TTK or TTK inhibitor could significantly increase cell apoptosis rates with cisplatin treatment . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 Page 5 of 10 Liu et al . J Ovarian Res ( 2021 ) 14 : 128 detectable in normal organs except the testis and pla - centa . However , high levels of TTK are found in many types of human malignancies . Overexpression of TTK promotes tumor growth in prostate cancer [ 17 ] , breast cancer [ 18 ] and colon cancer [ 19 ] . Thus , we guess that TTK inhibitor in combination with antimitotic cancer drugs will enhance their efficacy and potentially over - come resistance . In this study , we explored the possibility of sensitivity - reacquisition to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells through Fig . 4 TTK activated PI3K / AKT signaling pathway . A RNA - seq results showed the top 10 differential genes between A2780cis cells with and without TTK knockdown .

Actually , TTK expression was reduced when ovarian cancer cells were treated with cisplatin , indicating that TTK may serve as a chemo - therapeutic target ( Fig . S1 ) . Cisplatin - resistant cell line A2780cis was established by continued stimulation with gradually increased concentration of cisplatin . In cisplatin - resistant ovarian cancer cells , TTK was up - regulated compared with the parent tumor cells . Meanwhile , the overex - pression of TTK in cisplatin - resistant patients was veri - fied by immunohistochemistry . In the present study , we focus not the reason to cause resistance , but on the way to overcome resistance . Therefore , it is unclear whether the overexpressed TTK leads to cisplatin resistance or the cisplatin - resistant cells cause TTK overexpression . In our study , tumor cells will become resistant to chem - otherapy by several molecular mechanisms during the drug treatment . To tolerate genomic instability and ane - uploidy , the cisplatin - resistant cells will develop adaptive mechanisms . The spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) is the main mechanism that maintains chromosomal sta - bility through the cell division . TTK is a critical SAC component , which can promote the formation of mitotic checkpoint complex . Overexpression of TTK may be one of the important mechanisms for resistant tumor cells to live with aneuploidy . The results of the RNA - seq prove that TTK may have an impact through the change of p53 to affect the sen - sitivity of ovarian cancer to platinum drugs . p53 is an important tumor suppressor gene , involved in impor - tant biological processes such as cell differentiation , cell apoptosis , DNA repair , and cycle regulation [ 20 ] . The p53 signal pathway is an important way for platinum drugs to cause tumor cell DNA damage . Studies have shown that p53 protein aggregation damages the normal transcrip - tion of p53 gene and its apoptotic functions in different types of tumor cells , and can promote platinum resist - ance in ovarian cancer [ 21 ] . JAK / STAT signal transduction pathway is the common pathway of many cytokines , and it is widely involved in the processes of cell proliferation , differentiation , apop - tosis and inflammation [ 22 ] . JAK / STAT pathways [ 22 , 23 ] play an important role in tumor occurrence , develop - ment and drug resistance , and may become a new target for tumor treatment . PI3K / AKT / NF - κB signal pathways [ 24 , 25 ] are involved in tumor occurrence , development , invasion and metas - tasis . Some studies have shown that PI3K inhibitors are used for treatment of several human tumors , such as ovarian cancer [ 26 ] , breast cancer [ 27 ] , and leukemia [ 28 ] . In addition , it was also reported that activation of AKT was related to cisplatin - resistance in ovarian can - cer [ 29 ] . We further clarified that the activated signaling pathway by TTK was PI3K / AKT pathway , which played an important role in proliferation , migration , invasion and chemotherapy resistance [ 25 ] . We verified that inhibition of TTK expression could prevent the activation of PI3K / AKT pathway in cisplatin - resistant cells . However , the specific mechanisms for TTK to activate PI3K / AKT pathway need to be explored . Conclusions Our study demonstrated that TTK was overexpressed in ovarian cancer , and was further up - regulated in cis - platin - resistant cells .
