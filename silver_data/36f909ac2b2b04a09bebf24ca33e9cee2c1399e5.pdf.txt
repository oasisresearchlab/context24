Thus , transferring messages to the audience and creating a behavioural change on the audience , which are the bases of public relations , have acquired a new dimension . For this reason , professionals of public relations are creating practice areas in new digital - based communication platforms . Crowdfunding web pages , whose popularity has been increasing each passing day in the recent years , have become an important platform of transfer of messages , and have started to be used frequently by both the individuals and the professionals of public relations . This study researches how crowdfunding web pages can be used as a means of public relations and makes suggestions on the use of crowdfunding as a means of public relations as a result of the literature and netnographic research on the topic .

Thus , received messages have become imperceptible and unanswerable for the people . Accordingly , professionals of public relations have started to develop new strategies in the process of reaching the audience . Now , practices of public relations have moved beyond of only advertising or analysing feedbacks from the audience and have become a multifactorial The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication - TOJDAC April 2017 Volume 7 Issue 2 Submit Date : 10 . 01 . 2017 , Acceptance Date : 13 . 03 . 2017 , DOI NO : 10 . 7456 / 10702100 / 001 Copyright © The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication 151 organic structure . Therefore , professionals of public relations have focused on communication studies on the internet platform where information spreads quickly and reaches to large crowds . Due to both developments in communication technologies and development and constant changes in tendencies of people , new applications constantly appear in virtual platforms . While some of these applications fail , some of them reach great success . The popularity of on - line crowdfunding applications which appeared in 2000s has increased each passing day , and now they are among the most sought after applications in the world . This application , which was used by young entrepreneurs as a source of funding in the early times , started to be used in many fields such as art , charity and sport activities over the time . Thus , crowdfunding beyond being a simple search of funding , has become a strategic communication method . There have been many studies which aim to explain the factors affecting the success of campaigns of crowdfunding . This study differs from other studies in that it researches flow of communication by using netnography method . The aim of this study is to determine for which dimension of public relations the crowdfunding can be used by making use of a different research method , and to develop suggestions which are applicable to both corporate and individual marketing . THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS There have been acts of public relations throughout the history of humankind ; however , description studies of the concept from the aspect of both theory and practice started in the beginning of the 20 . century ( Cutlip , 2013 ) . There have been many studies intended to describe public relations and to determine its dimensions since beginning of the 20 . century . Factors like social changes , technological factors and globalisation played an important role at the basis of the non - complete description of the concept . In particular , corporations’ extending to wide areas and developing communication strategies for their activities forced the pace of the change of public relations into a profession . With public relation’s centering on both corporate and social life each passing day , criticism and applications regarding the issue have increased day by day . For this reason , new concepts are being included in public relations each passing day , and the border of the concept of public relations widens and assumes important responsibilities . Because , while public relations manages the present time , it builds up the future ( Pelteko ğ lu , 2015 : 1 ) . Within this framework , corporations which are included in social and economic life as a dynamic structure , need effective communication inside and the outside of the corporation in order to realise their unique functions ( Güven , 2016a : 135 ) In his article studying description of public relations Hutton ( 1999 ) defines the concept of public relations based on 472 different descriptions of public relations by Harlow as : “Public relations is a distinctive management function which helps establish and maintain mutual lines of communication , understanding , acceptance and co - operation . Definition , Dimensions , and Domain operation between an organization and its publics ; involves the management of problems or issues ; helps management to keep informed on and responsive to public opinion ; defines and emphasizes the responsibility of management to serve the public interest ; helps management keep abreast of and effectively utilize change , serving as an early warning system to help anticipate trends ; and uses research and sound and ethical communication techniques as its principal tools . ” Professionals of the occupation always maintained their studies on description of the concept even under the effects of rapid industrialisation in the beginning of the 20 . century and increasing globalisation in the 70s ( Long & Hazelton , 1987 ) . With 21 . century , the concept acquired a new dimension with the technological developments , and needed new description studies . With 21 . century , the concept has been under the effect of digitalisation and all the applications have gone into the process of digitalisation . Therefore , public relations can be defined as an organic communication chain which has horizontal and vertical components . Digitalisation of Public Relations The basis for the digitalisation of public relations is the digitalisation of communication . Any kind of information such as audio , picture and photograph has been digitalised with digital communication The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication - TOJDAC April 2017 Volume 7 Issue 2 Submit Date : 10 . 01 . 2017 , Acceptance Date : 13 . 03 . 2017 , DOI NO : 10 . 7456 / 10702100 / 001 Copyright © The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication 152 technologies ( Lee , 2012 : 2 ) . While innovations in communication technologies and development in means of transportation have an important effect in digitalisation of communication especially in the second half of the 20 . century , developments in question brought about creation of new relationship types and networks ( Güven , 2016b : 91 ) . Digitalisation of communication enables the topic to be analysed by both the digital sciences and social sciences ; and thus the concept have become an interdisciplinary study field . From the aspect of the communication sciences , the most important point in transition to digital communication is messaging of the devices . McLuhan ( 1964 ) gave a new perspective to the topic by saying The Device is The Message . McLuhan asserts that new communication technology creates a new life space and that flow of everything changes in this life space . That is to say , communication technologies constitute every layer of the life in schools , work places , homes , and it becomes impossible to interfere with them . In other words , technological elements plays a pivotal role in embodiment of cultural system , and constrain us in their own world . In addition , our messages somehow have started to be digitalised with digitalisation of devices . Now , our messages have started to reach to the opposite side with the pattern of digitalisation beyond our emotions . Communication and digitalisation have become such a structure which maintain themselves that messaging started to get lost within the digitalisation from time to time . Another effect of developments in communications technologies is that current communication devices have ceased to be a device of transferring messages and have become a source of message ( Seyfi & Güven , 2016 : 278 ) . Furthermore , new life spaces have been created and social sharings , grouping , perceiving others have occurred in various fashions with the digitalisation of communication ( Seyfi & Soyda ş , 2016 ) . In communication chain used via digital games , learning models based on classical and performative habits , and behavioural , affective and cognitive learning approaches have important effects on users ( Ku ş ay & Akbayır , 2015 : 152 ) . As a result of the intense effects of digitalisation on communication and society , public relations studies on digital platforms have been affected directly . In particular , new media’s being based on digital communication has brought about the obligation of putting forward a new perspective about the topic . Because , while traditional mass communication devices consider the audience as individuals without an identity , new technologies reaches to the individuals and transfers massages especially for an individual . Thus , transferring messages to the audience and creating a behavioural change on the audience , which are the bases of public relations , have acquired a new dimension . Developments in communication technologies have widened the audience . Professionals of public relations have started to use web - based applications frequently in order to reach a wider target audience . With public relations applications conducted on internet platforms , messages have become creative , quick and result - oriented . Moreover , popularity of web - based public relations applications have been increasing each passing day . ( Porter et al . , 2007 ; Anderson & Regan , 1992 ; Springston , 2001 ) . There are four elements underlying this increase in popularity of public relations in digital platforms . These are that they are strategic , integrated , targeted and measurable ( Holtz , 2002 : 16 ) . As a result of professionals of public relations’ using web - based applications intensely , many dimensions of public relations have become digitalised by being moved to online platforms . Within this framework , the mostly used dimensions of public relations in digital platforms are as follows ( Pelenk & Yılmaz , 2015 ) ; • Online News Bulletins • Search Engine Optimisation • Corporate Blogs • Corporate Web Design • Social Media Management • Relations with Online Communities • Online Crisis Management • Online Dignity Management The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication - TOJDAC April 2017 Volume 7 Issue 2 Submit Date : 10 . 01 . 2017 , Acceptance Date : 13 . 03 . 2017 , DOI NO : 10 . 7456 / 10702100 / 001 Copyright © The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication 153 Professionals of public relations tend to use every new popular communication platform as a means of public relations in order to make use of the advantages of digital communication . Within this framework , crowdfunding web pages whose popularity has been increasing in the recent years are being used as a means of public relations by both the individuals and corporations . CROWDFUNDING Crowdfunding is a new concept for entrepreneurs , business world , non - governmental organisations and individuals , and is a preferred platform to advertise the campaigns as successful and to fund the campaigns ( Gerber , 2011 ; Muller et al . , 2013 ; Vismara , 2016 ) . Crowdfunding is a method of funding that provides fund to an enterprise or a project suggested on the internet with the joint effort of friends , family and individual enterprisers ( Belleflamme et al . , 2014 ) . The most important feature of crowdfunding is that it produces a cheap and fast alternative for individuals who cannot reach traditional funding devices ( Gerber & Hui , 2013 : 2 ) . Beyond being a simple search for funding , crowdfunding is a successful platform in terms of enabling conventional flow of information . Therefore , crowdfunding web pages have social content activities like fund - raising as well as simple raising of funds ; and thus they can do miscellaneous advertising activities by getting in touch with other social media devices . This creates a new social network regarding the topic . Comments , likes and sharings of this social network can be considered as a new source of information ( Lu et al . , 2014 : 574 - 578 ) . Consequently , crowdfunding is not just a search for funding ; it can also be considered as a strategic communication method . Crowdfunding web pages have been growing each passing day . From 2009 up to now , in kickstarter , one of the most important representative of the sector , 12 million people have backed a Project , 2 , 8 billion dollar has been pledged , and 118 . 560 projects have been successfully funded ( www . kickstarter . com ) . President Obama raised a fund of more than 500 million dollars with his crowdfunding works on online platforms in 2008 ( http : / / www . crowd101 . com ) . Even if online crowdfunding web pages sprung in America , they have gained popularity all around the world . In 2011 , considering all types of crowdfunding , Europe raised around more than € 300 million , one third of the world market , through hundreds of thousands of crowdfunding campaigns . For 2012 , the estimate is that € 2 . 2 billion will be raised globally by crowdfunding platforms , up 80 % from € 1 . 2 billion in 2011 and € 400 million in 2009 ( De Buysere et al . , 2012 : 22 ) . Related Works With crowdfunding ' s reaching such a big market , the number of researches conducted about the topic has increased . When the studies about the topic are analysed , it can be seen that they generally focus on participant behaviours and factors affecting the success of funding . The studies conducted within this context can be summarised as follows : Analysis studies aimed to determine how updates about the campaign affect the result of the campaign in the process of campaign ( Xu et al . , 2014 ) ; qualitative studies aimed to search effects of internal social capital on the campaign ( Colombo et al . , 2015 ) ; researches aimed to determine the effects of the creator of the campaign on the campaign ( Wojciechowski , 2009 ) ; the effects of individual and aggregate studies on the campaign ( Hui et al . , 2014 ) ; studies aimed to determine the effects of social media on crowdfunding ( Lu et al . , 2014 ) . It can be seen that the studies generally focus on searching success and effect level of the campaign when these studies are analysed . The number of studies in which crowdfunding is seen as a corporate communication device is limited . The first person to search crowdfunding from the perspective of marketing is Macht . According to Macht , provision of funds can be considered as the beginning of a long - term relationship between funders and fund - seekers , which would bring fund - seekers value - added benefits after the crowdfunding projects ( Match , 2014 ) . Wang , in his master ' s degree paper whose title is “corporate crowdfunding as a marketing communication tool” studied the effects of corporate crowdfunding on marketing ( Wang , 2016 ) . In another study searching the relationship between crowdfunding and The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication - TOJDAC April 2017 Volume 7 Issue 2 Submit Date : 10 . 01 . 2017 , Acceptance Date : 13 . 03 . 2017 , DOI NO : 10 . 7456 / 10702100 / 001 Copyright © The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication 154 communication , it is determined that communication studies play an important role for the sustainability of crowdfunding ( Alfiero et al . , 2014 ) . METHODOLOGY The purpose of this study is to analyse how crowdfunding web pages are used as a means of public relations and to determine strategies accordingly . Within this context , methods of netnography and content analysis are used . Netnograpy is a natural , participatory , complementary , applicable research model which is from the new generation and has many methods ( Varnalı , 2012 ; 37 ) . The basis for netnography is adapting the ethnography , which is used by anthropologists , to the internet . Netnography identifies online communities and analyses behaviours of these communities which they show during communication flow , events and objects . The important thing in netnography is multi - dimensional analysis of effects of online platforms on human behaviour ( Kozinets , 2002 ) . Since the method of netnography has the perspective of ethnography , it focuses on rituals , symbols and values which are the elements of being a community . Since virtual communities occurred in online platforms are more flexible and dynamic than traditional communities that are known by everyone , they have different dynamics . Beyond values and symbols , communication flow which will reveal different dynamics will be evaluated from the perspective of ethnography in this study . Within this framework , the research questions are as follows : RQ1 : Is crowdfunding a means of public relations ? RQ2 : Which of the dimensions of interpersonal communication does method of dignity that is a sub - dimension of crowdfunding and public relations use ? RQ3 : At what rate are social media devices used in the process of crowdfunding ? RQ4 : Does communication between campaign owners and supporters happen within the perspective of public relations ? Research Findings Our study is conducted on communities created by participants of campaigns conducted on the web page of www . kickstarter . com which is one of the most popular online web pages . Within the context of the study , four random campaigns are analysed . Kickstarter is an online crowdfunding page which was established in 2009 . Data of their studies conducted until now can be summarised as : Category Launched Projects Total Dollars Successful Dollars Unsuccessful Dollars Live Dollars Live Projects Success Rate All 335 . 774 2 . 84 B 2 . 49 B 327 M 19 M 4 . 054 % 35 . 75 Table 1 : Statistics of crowdfunding of Kickstarter . com Distribution of conducted projects according to categories ; Category Launched Projects Total Dollars Successful Dollars Unsuccessful Dollars Live Dollars Live Projects Games 28 . 959 $ 589 . 66 M 532 . 69 M 52 . 72 M 4 . 25 M 453 Design 24 . 696 572 . 09 M 512 . 74 M 55 . 20 M 4 . 14 M 402 Technolog y 27 . 291 560 . 61 M 480 . 81 M 74 . 30 M 5 . 50 M 534 Film & Video 59 . 932 361 . 91 M 303 . 31 M 57 . 06 M 1 . 54 M 414 Music 49 . 936 187 . 06 M 170 . 55 15 . 78 M $ 736 . 63 460 The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication - TOJDAC April 2017 Volume 7 Issue 2 Submit Date : 10 . 01 . 2017 , Acceptance Date : 13 . 03 . 2017 , DOI NO : 10 . 7456 / 10702100 / 001 Copyright © The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication 155 M K Publishing 35 . 41 109 . 45 M 93 . 96 M 14 . 70 M $ 788 . 08 K 418 Food 21 . 763 108 . 40 M 90 . 49 M 17 . 43 M $ 484 . 40 K 260 Fashion 18 . 946 106 . 40 M 92 . 40 M 13 . 40 M $ 603 . 18 K 272 Art 24 . 7 76 . 06 M 66 . 71 M 9 . 08 M $ 276 . 05 K 318 Comics 8 . 976 59 . 98 M 55 . 45 M 4 . 23 M $ 295 . 94 K 129 Theater 10 . 125 40 . 50 M 36 . 16 M 4 . 29 M $ 47 , 876 60 Photograp hy 9 . 904 31 . 74 M 27 . 42 M 4 . 16 M $ 158 . 81 K 89 Dance 3 . 442 11 . 81 M 10 . 97 M $ 776 . 50 K $ 58 , 426 27 Crafts 7 . 459 11 . 63 M 9 . 64 M 1 . 91 M $ 71 , 069 159 Journalis m 4 . 235 10 . 77 M 9 . 04 M 1 . 65 M $ 73 , 732 59 Table2 : Distribution of crowdfunding statistics of Kickstarter . com according to categories When the campaigns conducted on kickstarter . com are examined , it can be seen that they are in 15 different categories , and communities created on this web page have different expectations and searches . It is remarkable that communities who have such different tendencies are in touch with each other on the same web page . This reveals the range of language and behavioural norms in online crowdfunding . Member Types : Corporate : Corporate entities , who are profit - oriented and non - profit corporations , seek support for their campaign on the web page . Groups : Owners of the projects offered by friend groups who are formed by various friends or other friend groups who involve in charity activities . Owners of Individual Campaign : Individuals who seeks funds for their own projects individually . Supporters : People who examine projects , comment on them , and provide financial support for them on the web page . These four clusters show a dynamic existence process . This dynamic existence process means that a person who is in the group of supporters can quickly be included in project offerors and vice versa . This transitivity among the member types also affects their way of communication . When the demographic features and communication skills of member types are analysed netnographically , it can be seen that many factors have emerged in the analysis of this virtual community . Primarily , due to the fact that people from all around the world come together and act supportively for each other , factors regarding cross - cultural communication have emerged . On the other hand , a communication that is focused intensely on discussion or sharing among the member types on this web page is observed . Generally , members tend to visit other social media pages or visit outer places where the campaign takes place in order to engage in more communication . Therefore , communication among member types takes shape in relation to both the content of the campaign and the communication skills of the campaign manager .

Owner of the Campaign : The owner of the campaign first talks about himself and then about his story . The brand “Cretoy” is a combination of Creative and Toy to reflect its being a creative and fun product . A creative product means that the product does not function in the same way for everyone but is instead something that changes , develops , and is re - created by users . Cretoy won the IDEA 2014 Gold Award for the Accordion Play House . This is our first project on Kickstarter , but our team has experience in design and product manufacturing . The Accordion Playhouse is a brand new product , so timely shipping worldwide will be the main obstacle for us . We will do our best in delivering the product on time . However , there is always a chance that the manufacturing process could be delayed . We kindly ask for your patience and promise to fulfil your order as soon as possible without sacrificing quality . Communication is the main key for us . Thank you in advance for your support to Cretoy Accordion Play House . The owner of the campaign mentions about the prize that will grant him a reputation in the paper introducing him . The Communication between the Supporter Group and Owner of the Campaign : Supporter : Very unique idea . Does the playhouse have a floor ? Why is the flag element a separate cost ? What are the dimensions of the door ? Is there a way to attach things to the walls ( like pictures ) ? I ' m sure a child will want to hang things from the roof - is there a way to do so ? The Owner of the Campaign : Tea Speaks Thanks , That ' s a good question . There is no a floor . The flag is not a necessary element . The size of the circle is 20inch ( 500mm ) in diameter . And the door has an elastic band so you can hang a doll . Ceilings and walls can be tied with clips . There are ten eyelets on the front and back plates and one on the door . It can be used to make flags or anything else . Evaluation of the Communication : While the owner does not care about answering messages coming from the supporters , he acts sensitive and solution - oriented for the criticism and suggestions . Campaign2 : HoneyComb : The Must Fun Electronic Block This campaign is supported by 72 supporters in 52 days , and 21 , 017 dollars is raised . The owner of the campaign aimed to raise 20 , 000 dollars and he easily overreached his aim . The Owner of the Campaign : We spent the last 12 months creating the next generation of electronic blocks , try integrate as cool technology as mind control , speech control , gesture recognition control to HoneyComb . No electronic experience , no coding , and no screens required , jut connect and play your creative . At beginning we launched our first 3 kits : • Music Kit - Change anything into an instrument . • Camera Kit - Create your own camera for multi - usage . • IoT Kit - Drag the blocks to learn programming Evaluation of the Communication : Between supporters and the owner of the campaign , there is generally supportive messages and an information exchange regarding the campaign . However , one message is completely out of the context of the campaign . This message coming from a different aspect proves that the flow of communication is not well - established . Supporter : Hi there , I have launched my first project on Kickstarter . Could you please support or share in your network ? Kids toy to motivate walking and stay fit https : / / www . kickstarter . com / projects / 650005707 / wheelo - play - unlimited Any suggestion most welcome . Campaign 3 : Growing in the City : The Mountair Park Community Farm This campaign is supported by 262 people and a total of 12 , 958 dollars is raised . The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication - TOJDAC April 2017 Volume 7 Issue 2 Submit Date : 10 . 01 . 2017 , Acceptance Date : 13 . 03 . 2017 , DOI NO : 10 . 7456 / 10702100 / 001 Copyright © The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication 157 The Owner of the Campaign : Sprout City Farms is about to break ground on the Mountair Park Community Farm in Lakewood , Colorado . We have been cultivating a one - acre farm at the Denver Green School since 2011 , and are ready to replicate our model for sustainable urban food production and community resource building in another neighbourhood ! This is the next big step in realizing our vision of creating a network of urban farms to support the Denver - metro area… . A large group of community members is helping guide development of the Mountair Park Community Farm and its programs . Possible food access efforts include farm to cafeteria programs for nearby schools , a donation - based farm stand , free and work shares in the CSA program , and donations to hunger relief organizations . Proposed educational opportunities include programs for local schools , community workshops , and an internship program . The possibilities are endless , but to make all of these community benefit programs a reality , we first have to build the farm ! Evaluation of the Communication : The owner of the campaign keep the communication live and transferred communication into different channels by making updates in the course of time ; thank you so much for your support to get Mountair Park Community Farm started ! Here’s more on what we’ve been up to , and scroll down to the bottom for a special update on our expansion— we’re now working on Farm # 3 here in Denver ! The owner of the campaign showed tendency to create layers by adding time and place to communication . This , beyond being a search for support , is an effort to communicate in a sustainable manner . Campaign 4 : Tortuga 1667 : A Pirate Game of Mutiny , Plunder & Deceit This campaign received 503 comments and the owner of the campaign made 4 updates . Within this framework , this is the campaign that has the most intense communication with its supporters Campaign Advertisement Paper The year is 1667 and you are a pirate sailing the waters of the Caribbean . A Spanish Galleon floats nearby , and you’ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure . What you haven’t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it . Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they’ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga . But you’ve seen your friends’ loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny . You know that nobody can be trusted . Evaluation of the Communication : Storytelling model is used , and statements that will affect imagination of the audience and that will create a sense of belonging on the audience in the campaign advertisement paper . A sustainable chain of communication is provided by using visuals in the flow of communication . Besides , the owner of the campaign shares the links of news and advertisement works about themselves on other social media and traditional media under the title of “Press” . This forms a basis for transmediatic narration . In the part of comment , the owner of the campaign answers the questions and suggestions of the supporters one by one . Therefore , a bilateral communication is provided .

Figure 4 : Advertisement Process of the Campaign The owner of the campaign moved his supporters into this platform via visual in Figure 4 . This gave the campaign the feature of transmediatic storytelling . In other words , different people from different layers supported the campaign . This is important in terms of sustainability of the communication . In the “Comment” part of the campaign , the owner of the campaign replied to each and every one of the participants . “Hi , folks ! Helper Stephanie here . I thought I ' d jump in this morning with a couple of points while Hans is still asleep in Arizona . : ) Frankly , he deserves the sleep . Big flu going on out there and he got hit hard . @ MichaelMTallman ( and many , many others ) - The Samurai Sword cross section is likely to show up as an add - on , but the quantity will be extremely limited - even by our standards . The blade is only so long ! @ \ [ T ] / SOLAIRE \ [ T ] / - You won ' t be disappointed in the process update . The Samurai Sword specimen was just an incredible thing to witness in production . @ Argail - The polish kit available in our shop will be available as an add - on during the post - campaign process . It can be used on any Mini Museum , though MM1 was made with a different material from MM2 / MM3 so you ' ll want to be sure to read the instructions we send along carefully . If I recall , there was a good discussion about the difference on the MM1 comment board . P . S . THANK YOU ! @ Justin Tobin - The complete MM3 run hasn ' t been determined yet but it will probably be a little larger than MM1 . It really depends on the number of 12 specimen versions that go in the Kickstarter here , and of course the very limited nature of the specimens . Hans is planning to release the size in a project update once we know . - - - If you have a question that we haven ' t answered , please feel free to reach out to us at service @ minimuseum . com ! ” The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication - TOJDAC April 2017 Volume 7 Issue 2 Submit Date : 10 . 01 . 2017 , Acceptance Date : 13 . 03 . 2017 , DOI NO : 10 . 7456 / 10702100 / 001 Copyright © The Turkish Online Journal of Design , Art and Communication 160 While writing the replies , the owner wrote both solution oriented for the problems and messages of thanks to the supporters . In addition , he shared his mail address for more information and sharings . Therefore , the strategy of supporting bilateral communication was followed . CONCLUSION Online crowdfunding devices find a considerable amount of supporters from different areas of the world . This is the outcome of the studies of communication which are important both from the visual and verbal aspect . In this study , elements regarding the use of crowdfunding as a communication device in public relations are researched . As a result of the literature review and field research , it can be seen that crowdfunding web pages are originated in America and they are gradually becoming popular in the Europe . A system that is used so much in different areas of the world occurred in a similar manner in different countries . However , they were not as successful as the American web pages . It is determined that the basis for this is problems in the countries regarding law and taxation . Especially in countries , in which works on legal infrastructure regarding internet applications are limited , these kind of applications are not very successful . Online crowdfunding web pages can be considered as a means of public relations since , in those pages , communication between groups takes place , there is bilateral communication which benefits both sides , there are planned studies aiming to affect the audience with honest and liable applications . This supports the studies conducted by Bu da Hui et al ( 2014 ) . Although crowdfunding web pages have become a means of public relations , these pages have brought about some problems . The owners of the campaigns and supporters in online crowdfunding web pages are intertwined . This raises difficulties in defining audience which is the basis for public relations . Therefore , handicaps are a matter of question when the audience and the owners of the campaigns are trying to know each other and communicate according to their expectations in online crowdfunding web pages . As a result of netnographic and content analyses , effects of crowdfunding web pages on both creating a sustainable communication and creating a sustainable society have been determined . Both applications of sustainable communication and works of creating a sustainable society have been observerd especially in campaign - 3 , campaign - 4 and campaign - 5 . Similarly , Sakamoto & Nakajima ( 2013 ) determined in their studies that crowdfunding increases awareness in terms of social sustainability . The most important public relations study in online crowdfunding web pages is studying content and studies aimed at marketing . The owners of the campaign creates stories about the campaigns and sometimes they transfer it to other social media platforms in order to find more supporters . Thus , transmedia storytelling narrations are created by creating a stratified structure in communication . However , it is determined in the field research that there are scarcely any transmedia applications . When considered from the perspective of public relations , the most important problem is the lack of an understanding of a professional management of communication . Communication is maintained according to the guidance of supporters . In addition , it is always difficult to build up reputation and trust on the internet platforms . In particular , building up reputation and trust on these kind of funding applications is really difficult ( Rubinton , 2011 : 5 ) . The basis solution for this problem is to build a serious public relations strategy at the very beginning of the campaign . In particular , skills , reputation , symbols , rituals and values of the owner of the campaign should be integrated with the campaign , and corporate identity should be reconstructed . Because , carrying traditional corporate identity is difficult in online crowdfunding platforms , and corporations can be seen as a simple trade company by supporters .
