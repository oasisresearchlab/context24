Ramanathan 1 , Daniel J . Muller 1 & Anthony A . Hyman 3 During mitosis , adherent animal cells undergo a drastic shape change , from essentially flat to round 1 – 3 . Mitotic cell rounding is thought to facilitate organization within the mitotic cell and be necessary for the geometric requirements of division 4 – 7 . However , the forces that drive this shape change remain poorly understood in the presence of external impediments , such as a tissue envir - onment 2 . Here we use cantilevers to track cell rounding force and volume . We show that cells have an outward rounding force , which increases as cells enter mitosis . We find that this mitotic rounding force depends both on the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the cells’ ability to regulate osmolarity . The rounding force itself is gener - ated by an osmotic pressure . However , the actomyosin cortex is required to maintain this rounding force against external impedi - ments . Instantaneous disruption of the actomyosin cortex leads to volume increase , and stimulation of actomyosin contraction leads to volume decrease . These results show that in cells , osmotic pres - sure is balanced by inwardly directed actomyosin cortex contrac - tion . Thus , by locally modulating actomyosin - cortex - dependent surface tension and globally regulating osmotic pressure , cells can control their volume , shape and mechanical properties . Toanalysecellshapeduringmitosis , wesimultaneouslyusedatomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , to measure cell height , and transmitted light microscopy , to measure cell width ( Methods and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Because we can determine the position of the cantilever with nano - metre precision , this provides a similarly precise measure of the cell dimensions . Metaphase HeLa cells had a height - to - width ratio of 0 . 86 6 0 . 04 ( mean 6 s . d . ; Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Mitotic cells with - out retraction fibres were almost spherical , as were interphase cells detached with trypsin ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) . Therefore , we con - cludethata detached , isolatedcellwillbenearlyspherical , independent of its cell cycle phase . This suggests that loss of adhesion as cells enter mitosis permits cell rounding 3 . A role for actin - based processes has previously been demonstrated in mitotic cell rounding 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 . Therefore , we tested the role of the actin cytoskeleton in maintaining a spherical shape by adding cyto - chalasin D to rounded cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , e ) . After treat - ment , both detached mitotic and interphase cells remained round . However , if retraction fibres were present , rounded cells sagged to height - to - width ratios of , 0 . 5 on cytochalasin D treatment . Therefore , the actomyosin cytoskeleton is necessary for generating a rounding force against adhesion . To quantify the force of cell rounding , a tipless cantilever was posi - tioned over a prophase HeLa cell , 8 m m above the substrate ( Fig . 1a ) , and held there while the cell underwent mitosis . We refer to this method as a ‘constant - height assay’ . When becoming rounder in pro - metaphase , the mitotic cell came in contact with the cantilever and the upward force that it exerted on the cantilever was measured with subnanonewton accuracy . Simultaneously , the cell’s progression through mitosis was monitored using light microscopy ( Fig . 1b ) . Within , 10min after nuclear envelope breakdown , cells were cylin - drical , and remained so until division . As cells progressed through prometaphase and into metaphase , the force exerted on the cantilever increased . Because cortical tension was uniform across the cell until anaphase 10 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , we were able to normalize force by 1 ETHZu¨rich , DepartmentofBiosystemsScienceandEngineering , CH - 4058Basel , Switzerland . 2 BiotechnologyCenter , UniversityofTechnologyDresden , D - 01307Dresden , Germany . 3 Max - Planck - InstituteofMolecularCellBiologyandGenetics , D - 1307Dresden , Germany . b c a Photodiode Prophasecell Lasersource Constant height Photodiode Metaphasecell Lasersource Constant height P Prometaphase Metaphase Anaphase P Prometaphase Metaphase Anaphase N E B D N E B D P P n as m s – 2 s 6 s 20 s 34 s 44 s – 4 s 2 s 26 s 48 s 54 s 100 80 60 40 20 0 F o r ce ( n N ) 50 40 30 20 10 0 Time ( min ) 0 . 20 0 . 15 0 . 10 0 . 05 0 . 00 100 80 60 40 20 0 Fo r ce ( n N ) 50 40 30 20 10 0 Time ( min ) 0 . 20 0 . 15 0 . 10 0 . 05 0 . 00 R o un d i n g p r e ss u r e ( n N µ m – 2 ) R o un d i n g p r e ss u r e ( n N µ m – 2 ) Δ V ∝ Δ F Figure 1 | Cells exert an increased rounding pressure in mitosis . a , Constant - height assay ( Methods Summary ) .

In metaphase , the rounding pressure reached a maximum at 0 . 14 6 0 . 04 nN m m 2 2 ( n 5 83 ) . At anaphase , before ingression of the cleavage furrow , there was a transient rise in the rounding pressure . Concomitant with cytokinesis , force decreased , and the daughter cells flattened and finally lost contact with the can - tilever . We also showed that individual G2 / prophase cells that had been pre - rounded with trypsin and progressed into mitosis ( Fig . 1c ) increased their rounding pressure by more than 3 - fold , despite cell size remaining relatively constant ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Thus , as cells enter mitosis , they can exert considerable forces against external objects . These changes in mechanical properties resemble those of early studies on sea urchin eggs 11 . To determine what mechanisms generate the increased rounding force during mitosis , we examined the forces exerted by mitotic cells in thepresenceofvariousperturbantsofthecytoskeleton . Allactomyosin inhibitors tested significantly reduced the rounding pressure ofmitotic cells ( Fig . 2a ) . In contrast , perturbing microtubule dynamics increased the exerted pressure ( Fig . 2a ) , perhaps because Rho / Rac guanine nuc - leotide exchange factor 2 was no longer inhibited 12 . Therefore , an intact actomyosin cortex , but not the microtubule cytoskeleton , is required for rounding cells to generate a rounding pressure against an external impediment . While performing the constant - height assay on mitotic cells using intermediate concentrationsof latrunculin A ( 40 – 100nM ) , wenoticed oscillations in the rounding force , which correlated with blebbing ( Fig . 2b ) . The rounding pressure decreased while blebs expanded , and recovered during bleb retraction ( Fig . 2b ) . A bleb forms when a section of membrane detaches from the actomyosin cortex 13 and retracts when the actomyosin cortex reassembles underneath the membrane and pulls the bleb back into the main cell body 14 . The concurrence of bleb formation and the decrease in rounding pressure suggests that the cell was under hydrostatic pressure : the pressure inside the cells pushing the cantilever upward was partially released when a bleb formed 15 . This interpretation is supported by recent mea - surements quantitatively relating cortical actomyosin tension with bleb formation 16 . The force on the cantilever could be a result of osmotic pressure . If theosmolarity ishigherinsidethecellthan outside , water willflowinto the cell and generate a hydrostatic pressure . To test this idea , we modulated the osmolarity of the medium . Introduction of hypotonic medium ( 2 D 100mosM l 2 1 ) led to an immediate increase in the volume of metaphase cells ( 40 6 6 % ; n 5 9 ) , indicating that water entered the cells ( Fig . 3a ) . This was accompanied by a concurrent increase in the measured rounding pressure ( 76 6 20 % ; n 5 9 ) , pre - sumably because the intracellular pressure increased . Within 3 min of the osmolarity changing , the cell volume and rounding pressure returned to close to their original values . This is probably because , in response to increased osmotic pressure , regulatory volume decrease causes cells to release ions 17 . Conversely , when hypertonic medium ( 1 D 200mosM l 2 1 ) was introduced ( Fig . 3b ) the changes in volume ( 2 24 6 4 % ; n 5 9 ) and rounding pressure ( 2 30 6 14 % ; n 5 9 ) were in theopposite direction . Again , the cells recovered the original round - ing pressure and volume , presumably because regulatory volume increase triggers the influx of osmolytes 17 . Because ion transporters at the plasma membrane increase intracel - lularosmoticpressureandrestorethevolumeofcellsimmediatelyafter hypertonic challenge , we reasoned that they might also contribute to the increased rounding pressure seen in mitosis ( Fig . 1 ) . Therefore , we tested the effect of inhibiting ion transporters important in regulatory volume increase 17 . Among the inhibitors tested , an inhibitor of Na 1 / H 1 antiporters , ethylisopropylamiloride , caused the greatest decrease in rounding pressure ( 2 53 6 10 % ; n 5 19 ) and volume ( 2 8 6 2 % ; n 5 19 ) ( Fig . 3c ) . The exchange of a proton with a Na 1 ion increases the intracellular osmolarity because pH is strongly buffered in the cytoplasm ; thus , a Na 1 ion has a greater effect on osmolarity than a proton 17 , 18 . These results suggest the Na 1 / H 1 antiporter increases mitotic rounding pressure , and agree well with data showing that the Na 1 / H 1 antiporter SLC9A1 is activated at the G2 – M transition 19 . We next perturbed the ion gradients across the plasma membrane using Staphylococcus aureus a - toxin , which confers permeability to monovalent cations 20 . When added to metaphase cells , it caused a decrease in both volume ( 2 42 6 4 % ; n 5 11 ) and rounding pressure a b U n t r ea t e d L a t A ( n M ) C y t o D ( µ M ) B l e b ( μ M ) Y - 27632 ( μ M ) N o c o ( n M ) V B L ( n M ) T a x o l ( n M ) S T C ( μ M ) Actomyosin Spindle 0 . 10 0 . 08 0 . 06 0 . 04 24 23 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 N o r m a li z e d v o l u m e 22 min 40 s 23 min 20 s 24 min 40 s P PM M A 0 . 25 0 . 20 0 . 15 0 . 10 0 . 05 0 . 00 83 7 12 7 4 6 5 6 10 8 5 6 10 40 100 200 1 10 100 330 100 100 2 60 40 20 0 Fo r ce ( n N ) 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Time ( min ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * R o un d i n g p r e ss u r e ( n N μ m − 2 ) R o un d i n g p r e ss u r e ( n N μ m − 2 ) Figure 2 | Mitotic cells require a functional actin cytoskeleton to generate rounding pressure . a , Maximum rounding pressures generated by mitotic cells while incubated with inhibitors of the actomyosin system ( latrunculin A ( LatA , n 5 7 , 12 , 7 , and 4 , respectively ) , cytochalasin D ( CytoD , n 5 6 ) , blebbistatin ( Bleb , n 5 5 ) , and Y - 27632 ( n 5 6 ) ) or microtubule spindle perturbants ( nocodazole ( Noco , n 5 10 ) , vinblastine ( VBL , n 5 8 ) , Taxol ( TXL , n 5 5 ) and S - trityl - cysteine ( STC , n 5 6 ) ) .

Another pore - forming toxin , Escherichia coli haemolysin A ( HlyA ) , which also renders the plasma membrane permeable to cations 21 , also reduced the volume and rounding pressure of mitotic cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Disruption of the actomyosin cortex with a combination of blebbis - tatin and latrunculin A before S . aureus a - toxin treatment reduced the toxin’s ability to decrease cell volume ( Fig . 3e ) , suggesting a con - tribution of the actomyosin cortex . We do not know whether this was dueto an inward pressure caused by theactomyosin cortex or to more indirect mechanisms of volume regulation . To further probe the link between osmotic pressure and actomyosin contraction , we performed experiments where we spontaneously abol - ished or stimulated the actomyosin cortex . If there is an intracellular pressure opposed by the actomyosin cortex , disruption of the cortex should result in dissipation of intracellular pressure and a small increase in cell volume . Indeed , when we treated mitotic cells first with blebbistatin , which inhibits myosin II contraction , and then with latrunculin A to depolymerize actin filaments , the volume of mitotic cells increased by 7 6 4 % ( n 5 36 ) and the mitotic rounding pressure was abolished ( Fig . 3f ) . To study the converse case , we then looked at the effects of instantaneous activation of the actomyosin cortex . To do this we took advantage of blebbistatin’s propensity to be inactivated by blue light 22 . When we photoinactivated blebbistatin , mitotic cells responded with an increase in rounding pressure and a decrease in volume ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . We conclude that stimulating con - traction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton increases rounding pressure and decreases volume , whereas disrupting actomyosin activity reduces rounding pressure and increases volume . Our experiments show that perturbation of osmotic gradients , associated transporters and the actomyosin cortex caused changes in both volume and rounding pressure ( Fig . 4 ) . When osmotic pres - sure was reduced , rounding pressure and volume decreased ( Fig . 4a , b , lower left quadrants ) . Conversely , if osmotic pressure was increased , rounding pressure and volume increased ( Fig . 4a , b , upper right quadrants ) . When the actomyosin cytoskeleton was abolished , cell volume increased while rounding pressure decreased ( Fig . 4a , b , lower right quadrants ) . However , rounding pressure increased as volume decreased after actomyosin contraction was stimulated ( Fig . 4a , b , upper left quadrants ) . In conclusion , these results reveal that the actomyosin cortex contracts against an opposing intracellu - lar osmotic pressure . We propose the following model for the active processes that drive cell rounding during mitosis . As cells enter mitosis , de - adhesion from the substrate allows cells to become rounder 3 ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 1 ) . At the same time , cells increase their intracellular pres - sure ( Fig . 1 ) , presumably to drive rounding in a tightly packed tissue environment . Our model implies that intracellular pressure is at least equal to the measured rounding pressure , , 150 Pa ( 0 . 15 nN m m 2 2 ; Fig . 1 ) . A pressure difference across the cell membrane of 100 – 500 Pa is thought to be sufficient to cause cell blebbing 15 and is within the range typically measured in micropipette aspiration techniques 23 ( 1 – 1 , 000 Pa ) . A corollary to this model is that a non - homogeneous cortex results in dissimilar cell surface curvatures such as those observed in blebbing cells . In conjunction with an intracellular hydrostatic pressure , local modulation of cortical tension would allow cells to alter their shape 24 , 25 , control their motion 25 – 29 and govern the mechanics of mitosis 15 . Pressure gradients are known to drive shape changes in organisms with cell walls 30 . Ourexperimentssupport the ideathat the actomyosin cortex behaves like an internal cell wall that directs osmotic expansion to control animal cell shape 25 – 29 . Given the intricate shapes microor - ganisms and plants are able to achieve using turgor pressure , it is perhaps not surprising that animal cells have also evolved a mech - anism that makes use of osmotic pressure . 0 . 20 0 . 16 0 . 12 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 Time ( min ) 1 . 4 1 . 0 0 . 6 a b R P ( n N µ m – 2 ) R P ( n N µ m – 2 ) Hypotonic 0 . 12 0 . 10 0 . 08 0 . 06 30 28 26 24 22 20 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 Hypertonic c d 0 . 12 0 . 08 0 . 04 0 . 00 70 60 50 40 30 20 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 α - toxin 32 28 24 20 16 Time ( min ) Time ( min ) 1 . 1 1 . 0 0 . 9 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 20 0 . 15 0 . 10 0 . 05 EIPA 0 . 03 0 . 02 0 . 01 0 . 00 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 1 . 1 1 . 0 0 . 9 e f N o r m a li z e d v o l u m e N o r m a li z e d v o l u m e LatA LatA α - toxin 0 . 04 0 . 03 0 . 02 0 . 01 0 . 00 60 50 40 30 20 10 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 Figure 3 | The actomyosin cortex contracts against an intracellular osmotic pressure .

HeLa - Kyoto cells expressing a fluorescent histone construct ( H2B – GFP ) were grown to , 50 % confluency on 24 - mm - diameter glass coverslips for cantilever experiments . We used DMEM containing 4mM sodium bicarbonate ( PN : 31600 - 083 , Invitrogen ) buffered with 20mM HEPES for experiments . Instrumentation . The experimental set - up consisted of an AFM ( Nanowizard I , JPK Instruments ) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M optical microscope . Tipless cantilevers were , 250 m m long , 35 m m wide , 2 m m thick and made of pure silicon ( NSC12 - D / tipless / noAl , k < 0 . 3Nm 2 1 , Mikromasch ) . A BioCell ( JPK Instruments ) maintained cells at 37 u C . AFM constant - height assay . We positioned the end of the cantilever over a candidate cell , 8 m m above the substrate . A laser beam was used to monitor the positionofthecantilever , whichwascalibratedandusedtorecordforcesgenerated by cells . Rounding pressure was derived by dividing the measured force by the horizontal cross - sectional area of the cell , which wasmeasured using DIC images . Cell volume was determined by multiplying the cross - sectional area of the near - cylindrical cell by its height under the cantilever . The 6 2 % error in rounding pressure and volume shown in the figures is based on measurement uncertainty from DIC images . In Fig . 2a , cells were pre - incubated with perturbants . In Fig 3a , b , tonic shock wasinduced by exchanging the full volume of the AFMBioCellseveral times with WPI Aladdin push – pull pumps . In Fig . 3c – f , perturbants were added to the AFM BioCell with a microsyringe . WedeterminedthefollowingmitoticphasesfromH2B – GFPimages : prophase , condensed chromosomes but intact nucleus ; prometaphase , nuclear envelope breakdown ; metaphase , chromosomes aligned to form a metaphase plate ; ana - phase , two sets of chromosomes separated .

In some experiments , cells additionally expressing mCherry – CAAX , fluorescently marking the plasma membrane , were used . To construct the mCherry – CAAX plasmid ( TH0477 ) , a DNA sequence ( 5 9 - TGCATGAGCTGC AAGTGTGTGCTGTCC - 3 9 ) fromthecarboxyterminusoftheratc - H - Ras1gene was inserted to the C terminus of the mCherry gene 32 . The mCherry – CAAX plasmid was transfected into H2B – GFP cells and selected by puromycin resist - ance . CellsweremaintainedinDMEMsupplementedwith10 % fetalbovineserum ( FBS ) , 2mMGlutaMAX , 100unitsml 2 1 penicillin , 100 m gml 2 1 streptomycinand 0 . 5mgml 2 1 Geneticin ( allInvitrogen ) at37 u Cina5 % CO 2 environment . DMEM used for AFM experiments ( cat . no . 31600 - 083 , Invitrogen ) contained only 4mM sodium bicarbonate and was instead buffered with 20mM HEPES / NaOH to pH7 . 2 . When using dynasore and trypsin , NuSerum ( Fischer Scientific ) was sub - stituted for FBS at the corresponding concentration . For AFM experiments , cells were plated on 24 - mm - diameter glass coverslips ( Marienfeld ) and grown for 2days until they reached , 50 % confluency . Perturbants . Chemical inhibitorswere acquired fromSigma - Aldrichexcept jaspla - kinolide ( Merck ) and trypsin ( Invitrogen ) and used at the indicated concentrations . In cases where perturbants were added during a measurement , a microsyringe ( Hamilton ) was used to inject agents into the AFM BioCell or the full volume was exchanged several times with a WPI Aladdin push – pull pump set - up ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 7a ) . Supplementary Table 1 lists all perturbants used and how they were added to cells , and provides a short description of what the perturbant does . Pore - forming - toxinexperiments . S . aureus a - toxinstockwasmadeat2mgml 2 1 in PBS . Owing to having limited amounts of toxin stock , we added 100 m l of a 3 5 concentrate to 400 m l of medium to arrive at the final concentration . Concentrate wasaddedwithatubeandsyringeinthemannershowninSupplementaryFig . 7a . Ata givenconcentrationof a - toxin , more crowdedcoverslips seemedtodilutethe potency of the toxin . Thus , for toxin experiments we attempted to keep the cell confluency constant at 40 – 50 % . Concentrations at and below 20 m gml 2 1 had no noticeableeffect on cells . Wefound a dosage of40 – 80 m gml 2 1 caused effects such as those seen in Fig . 3d . Haemolysin A stock wasmade up at 910 m gml 2 1 in 8M guanine / HCl solution . Again , owingtohavinglimitedamountsoftoxinstockweusedthe 3 5concentrate ‘addition’ method described for a - toxin . We found that a final concentration of 1 m gml 2 1 hadlittleeffectoncells . However , using2 – 4 m gml 2 1 weobtainedtypical results seen in Supplementary Fig . 4 . Osmolarity change experiments . For osmolarity change experiments , the volume of the AFM BioCell ( , 400 m l ) was exchanged four times at a flow rate of 2 , 500 m lmin 2 1 using a WPI Aladdin push – pull pump . For hypotonic exchanges , DMEM ( 290mosMkg 2 1 ) was diluted with water to 190mosMkg 2 1 . In the case of hypertonic exchanges , DMEM was supplemented with xylose to increase osmolarity to 490mosMkg 2 1 . To minimize disturbance of the AFM laser , the refractive index of all solutions was matched with Ficoll ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , aninertsucrosepolymerwithnegligible effect onosmolarityinsolution . Mid - experiment introduction of perturbants : balancing refractive index and osmolarity difference . In cases where the perturbant mixture differed from the original medium in refractive index , we added Ficoll to the solution having lower refractive index until the solutions matched . 1 % w / v Ficoll increased refractive index by 0 . 0013 with negligible change to osmolarity . In cases where the perturbant mixture and original medium had an unintended mismatch inosmolarity , we used xylose to raise the osmolarity of the lower - osmo - larity solution . 1 % w / v xylose increases osmolarity by 70mosMl 2 1 but also increased refractive index by 0 . 0013 . In such cases , Ficoll was additionally used to matchrefractiveindex . Inallcases , Ficollandxyloseneverexceeded3 % w / vanddid not negatively effectprogressionthroughmitosis or the rounding forcesmeasured . Instrumentation . The experimental set - up consisted of an AFM ( Nanowizard I , JPKInstruments ) mountedonanAxiovert200Mopticalmicroscope ( CarlZeiss ) . A BioCell ( JPKInstruments ) allowedcellstobeculturedat37 u Cduringexperiments . Tipless cantilevers were , 250 m m long , 35 m m wide , 2 m m thick and made of pure silicon ( NSC12 - D / tipless / noAl from Mikromasch ) and had a nominal force con - stant of 0 . 3Nm 2 1 . Cantilevers were calibrated using the thermal noise method 33 . AFMconstant - heightassay . Theprocedureforan8 - m mconstant - heightassayof amitoticHeLacellwasasfollows . Theheightofthesubstrateadjacenttoacellwas determined . Then the cantilever end was positioned over the cell , 8 m m above the substrate . Prophase cells typically had heights of , 7 m m , and were therefore initially not in contact with the cantilever . The force exerted by the rounding mitotic cell was sensed by the cantilever and recorded over time . Rounding pres - sure was derived by dividing the force measured by the horizontal cross - sectional area of the cell , which was measured from DIC images of the cell ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . Cellvolumewasdeterminedbymultiplyingthecross - sectionalareaofthe near - cylindricalcellbyitsheightunderthecantilever ( SupplementaryFig . 7c ) . The 6 2 % error on rounding pressure and volume is based on measurement uncer - tainty from DIC images . After a constant - height assay , the height of the substrate wasre - measuredtoassessmechanicaldrift . Experimentswithmorethan10 % drift inrelativeheightwerediscarded . Cantileverdeflectiondriftwasusually , 2nNper hour andcould beneglected when considering the magnitudeof forces measured . Cell height and shape measurements . Cell heights were determined using AFM . Because the cell is soft , particularly when treated with actin perturbants , the cell height was determined by extracting a contact point from force – distance curves . As the cantilever approached the cell , a small force , of , 100 – 200pN , is registered atthecantileveruponcontact . Theverticaldistancebetweenthiscontactpointand the substrate was defined as the cell height . To obtain a cell height - to - width ratio , the cell’s width was measured using DIC microscopy images . Opticalmicroscopy . Foropticalmicroscopy , aPlanApochromat 3 20 / 0 . 8object - ive lens ( Zeiss ) was used . Images were acquired with a CoolSNAP cf camera ( Roper Scientific ) driven by METAMORPH software ( Visitron ) . An alternative set - up featuring an MRM camera ( Zeiss ) and AXIOVISION software ( Zeiss ) was used to acquire andanalyse images in some experiments , including the ApoTome optical sectioning shown in Supplementary Fig . 7b . ForH2B – GFP andmCherry – CAAX imaging , FITC and Texas red filter sets were respectively used . Mitotic phase assignment . H2B – GFPimages were usedtodetermine the phaseof mitosis according to the following criteria : prophase cells contain condensed chro - mosomes surrounded by a nuclear envelope ; prometaphase starts with nuclear envelopebreakdown ; metaphaseiswhenchromosomesalignatthemetaphaseplate ; and anaphase is when the two sets of chromosomes separate . Cortical stiffness measurements . The measurement was made by indenting the cell cortex using a 5 - m m - diameter bead glued to a NPO tipless cantilever ( Veeco ; nominal stiffness , 50mNm 2 1 ) with a forceof2nN . The Young’smodulus ateach indentation was calculated by least - squares fitting a parabolic curve to the force – indentation curve at contact 34 . The method was adapted from ref . 35 . The bead diameter was determined using its DIC image and the cantilever spring constant was determined as described above . We assumed the cell to have a Poisson’s ratio of 0 . 5 ( ref . 35 ) . Constant - height assay design . We started these experiments by using soft canti - levers ( Nanoworld TL1 , k < 50mNm 2 1 ) . However they could neither measure nor apply forces over 20nN ; therefore , we changed to stiff cantilevers . We prefer them because they allowed us to measure a wide range of forces , from tens of piconewtons to hundreds of nanonewtons . Using such cantilevers in an 8 - m m constant - heightassay ( SupplementaryFig . 7 ) allowedustosampleforce , rounding pressure and volume continuously . This was key to understanding perturbations where volume and pressure respond quickly ( Figs 2 and 3 ) . Additionally , we compared the effect of long - term constraint under the cantilever with measure - ments on a shorter timescale using a simple rheological compression assay ( Supplementary Fig . 8c ) . We plotted our two data sets , constant - height assays ( n 5 123 ) and compression assays ( n 5 100 ) , as force versus deformation ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) and contact stress versus strain ( Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . Becausewegetsimilarresultswhetherwe‘constrainthecell’ormakeasimple mechanical measurement on an already round one , we conclude that our con - stant - height assay is applicable to studying mitotic cell rounding over a broad range of deformations and timescales . Cell viability under the cantilever . To investigate the effect of constraining cell shape in our assay on progression through mitosis , we measured the times taken for individual cells to progress from prophase to anaphase ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) . Cells either subjected to a constant force of 1 – 50nN or constrained to a constantheightof8 m mprogressedthroughmitosisunaffected . However , addition of cytochalasin D to cells in an 8 - m m constant - height assay slightly extended the time between nuclear envelope breakdown and anaphase . Additionally , the height - to - width ratio attainedby mitotic cells becoming rounder against constant forces is plotted in Supplementary Fig . 9b . 31 . Neumann , B . etal .
