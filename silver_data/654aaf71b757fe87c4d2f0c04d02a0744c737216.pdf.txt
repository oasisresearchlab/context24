This paper reviews related work and drafts an approach we intend to follow . We plan to adopt generative neural language models and hierarchical generation approaches , supported by summariza - tion and machine translation methods , and comple - mented with a human - in - the - loop approach . 1 Introduction We introduce the THEaiTRE project , 1 which aims to produce and stage the ﬁrst computer - generated theatre play . This play will be presented on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Karel ˇCapek’s play R . U . R . [ ˇCapek , 1920 ] , for which the word “robot” was invented by ˇCapek . The project , currently in its early stages , is at the inter - section of artiﬁcial intelligence research and theatre studies . The core of our approach is to use state - of - the - art deep neural models trained and ﬁne - tuned on theatre play data . However , our team includes both experts on natural language process - ing and theatre experts , and our solution will be based on re - search and exchange of experience from both ﬁelds . In this paper , we ﬁrst review related previous works ( Sec - tion 2 ) and data resources available to us ( Section 3 ) . We then draft the approaches we are following and intending to follow in the project ( Section 4 ) and present the project time - line ( Section 5 ) . 2 Related Work 2 . 1 Narrative Natural Language Generation While we are not aware of any generation systems speciﬁcally aimed at theatre play generation , research in story / narrative generation has been quite active in the past years , with computer - aided systems allowing various degrees of au - tomation and different abilities in learning from data [ Kybartas and Bidarra , 2017 ; Riedl , 2018 ] . Since recur - rent neural networks ( RNN ) were applied for text gen - eration [ Bahdanau et al . , 2015 ; Sutskever et al . , 2014 ] , re - search in story generation has mostly focused on fully 1 https : / / www . theaitre . com / data - driven , fully automated approaches . As plain RNNs were found unsuitable for producing longer , coherent texts [ Wiseman et al . , 2017 ] , multiple improvements have been proposed . The ﬁrst line of work focuses on providing a higher - level semantic representation to the networks and condi - tioning the generation on it . Martin et al . [ 2018 ] and Ammanabrolu et al . [ 2019 ; 2020 ] use an event - based repre - sentation , where an event roughly represents a clause ( predi - cate , subject , direct and indirect object ) . The model generates the story at the event level and subsequently realizes the in - dividual events to surface sentences . Tu et al . [ 2019 ] take a similar approach , using frame semantics and also condition - ing sentence generation on other information , such as senti - ment . Other works focus on explicit entity modelling across the generated story , e . g . , Clark et al . [ 2018 ] . Here , each entity has its own distributed representation ( embedding ) , which is updated on each mention of the entity in the story . Multiple authors attempt to increase long - term coherence by hierarchical story generation . Fan et al . [ 2018 ] generate ﬁrst a short prompt / tagline , then use it to condition the full story generation . Yao et al . [ 2019 ] take a similar approach , using a “storyline” – a list of entities and items to be in - troduced in the story in the given order . Fan et al . [ 2019 ] then combine the hierarchical generation with explicit entity modelling . Their system generates outputs using anonymized but tracked entities , which are subsequently lexicalized in the context of the story by generating referring expressions . Several works experiment with altering the base RNN architecture : Wang and Wan [ 2019 ] use a modiﬁed Trans - former architecture [ Vaswani et al . , 2017 ] , which is trained as a conditional variational autoencoder . Tambwekar et al . [ 2019 ] utilize reinforcement learning with automati - cally induced rewards to train their event - based model . Ammanabrolu et al . [ 2019 ; 2020 ] extend this work by experimenting with various sentence realization techniques , including retrieval from database and post - editing . Latest works use massive pretrained language models based on the Transformer architecture , such as GPT - 2 [ Radford et al . , 2019 ] , for generation . See et al . [ 2019 ] use GPT - 2 directly and show that it is superior to plain RNNs . Mao et al . [ 2019 ] apply GPT - 2 ﬁne - tuned for both story gen - eration and common - sense reasoning to improve coherence . 1 While research in this area has progressed consider - ably , most experiments have been performed on rather short and simple stories , such as the ROCStories corpus [ Mostafazadeh et al . , 2016 ] . Many works focus on lim - ited tasks , such as single - sentence continuation generation [ Tu et al . , 2019 ] . The state - of - the - art results still cannot match human performance , producing repetitive and dull out - puts [ See et al . , 2019 ] . 2 . 2 Dramatic Analysis For our needs , we are mostly interested in classiﬁcations and abstractions over theatre play scripts or their parts . In the ﬁeld of theatre studies , there is a vast amount of research on the structure and interpretation of theatre plays . Unfortunately , the results of such research are not made available in forms and formats that would easily allow us to use these as data and annotations in machine learning approaches . The Thirty - Six Dramatic Situations by Polti [ 1921 ] 2 is a classic work , in which the author presented a supposedly ulti - mate list of all categories of possible dramatic situations that can occur in a theatre play ( e . g . “adultery” or “conﬂict with a god” ) , further subclassiﬁed into 323 situational possibilities . Although not directly related to theatre plays , the work of [ Propp , 1968 ] is also essential . Propp analyzed Russian folk tales and identiﬁed 31 functions , similar to Polti’s situations but somewhat more down - to - earth ( e . g . “villainy” or “wed - ding” ) , as well as 7 abstract character types ( e . g . “villain” or “hero” ) and other abstractions . Polti’s and Propp’s categorizations are sometimes used in analyzing and generating narratives , although typically not in drama . The work closest to our focus is probably that of [ Gervás et al . , 2016 ] , who devised an ontology of abstrac - tions for annotating musical theatre scripts , based on both of the mentioned works , as well as on more recent plot catego - rization studies [ Booker , 2004 ; Tobias , 2011 ] . There are also works producing drama analyses in the form of networks , capturing various relations between the characters in the play [ Moretti , 2014 ; Horstmann , 2019 ; Fischer et al . , 2019 ] . 2 . 3 Computer - Generated Art There already is a range of partially or fully artiﬁcially gen - erated works of art , some of which we list here . While this demonstrates the technical possibility of such an approach , the mixed reception of the outcomes shows that the employed technologies are clearly not on par with humans ( yet ? ) . Sunspring is a short sci - ﬁ movie with an LSTM - generated and human - post - edited script [ Benjamin et al . , 2016 ] . Beyond the Fence is a musical based on suggestions from several automated tools , heavily human - post - edited [ Colton et al . , 2016 ] . Poezie um ˇ elého sv ˇ eta is a human - picked collection of com - puter generated poems [ Materna , 2016 ] . Lifestyle of the Richard and Family is a theatre play writ - ten with the help of a next word suggestion tool [ Helper , 2018 ] . 2 https : / / en . wikipedia . org / wiki / The _ Thirty - Six _ Dramatic _ Situations From the Future World is a musical composition gener - ated in the style of Antonín Dvoˇrák [ AIVA et al . , 2019 ] 3 Data Resources It is necessary to collect as much data as possible to train or at least to ﬁne - tune our system for generating theatre plays , ide - ally well - formatted theatre scripts or movie scripts . We also collect synopses – brief summaries of the major points of the plays , which could be used for generating the play hierarchi - cally ( see Section 4 . 2 ) . We focus on the English and Czech languages and , sur - prisingly , we have more and better data available for Czech . So far , we collected more than 600 plays and 1 , 500 synopses in Czech and about 150 plays and 100 synopses in English . However , the quality of the data is not ideal in many cases . The majority of the data is in plain - text or HTML / XML for - mat , but it is often hard to automatically distinguish character names , lines , scenic notes and scene settings . A lot of nor - malization will be required to process many different input formats . Summaries and plays will need to be paired together since they may come from different sources . Our plan is to convert as many theatre plays as possible into one common JSON format properly structured into acts , scenes , and dialogues . We may release a part of our play corpus in this format where copyright restrictions allow us to do so . 4 Planned Approach We intend to base our approach in generative neural mod - els ( Section 4 . 1 ) applied in a hierarchical setup ( Section 4 . 2 ) . This setup will be complemented by synthesizing training data using summarization techniques ( Section 4 . 3 ) , auto - mated machine translation to allow for working with inputs and outputs in both English and Czech ( Section 4 . 4 ) , and a human - in - the - loopstyle cooperation of the automated system with theatre professionals ( Section 4 . 5 ) . 4 . 1 Applying Neural Language Models Large neural language models ( LMs ) , such as GPT - 2 [ Radford et al . , 2019 ; see Section 2 . 1 ] , are able to generate believable texts in certain domains ( e . g . news articles ) . This is not the case for the domain of theatre plays . The original GPT - 2 must have had a number of plays ( or movie scripts ) in the training data , which is evident when it is presented with a suitable starting prompt . It can produce a text that follows the formal structure and has some level of content coherence . However , the basic attributes of a dramatic situation are miss - ing : there is no plot , and the scene is not moving towards a conclusion . Other problems include having new characters appear randomly in the middle of the scene or falling into a state of repeating the same sentence forever . Our basic workﬂow would be to seed an LM with a prompt which is the beginning of a dramatic situation . The LM would generate the rest of the whole dialogue . We plan to ﬁnetune the LM to theatre plays to see how far this approach can go . Then we plan to restrict the generation by enforcing that only certain predetermined characters speak , possibly in a pregen - erated order . This can be achieved by stopping the generation 2 at the end of a character’s line , adding the name of the next desired character and then resuming the generation process . To make the characters more internally consistent and dif - ferent from each other at the same time , we plan to devise individual LMs specialized to speciﬁc character types , based on a clustering of the characters across plays . The part of each character would then be generated by a different LM ; i . e . , the script would consist of several LMs “talking” to each other . 4 . 2 Hierarchical Generation We also plan to extend our experiments with hierarchical gen - eration from large pretrained LMs . We will use an approach similar to Fan et al . [ 2018 ] and Yao et al . [ 2019 ] ( see Sec - tion 2 . 1 ) : starting with generating a title or a prompt for the story , then generating a textual synopsis . The generation of the play from the synopsis will follow as a novel step , not present in previous works . We are considering multiple op - tions of what to choose as the synopsis representation : the play background / setting from play databases , more detailed synopses from fan websites , or scenic remarks extracted from texts of plays themselves . Ultimately , the choice will be made based on data availability . The synopsis generation step should also include generating the list of characters , which will be adhered to in the ﬁnal text generation step . The ﬁnal step will use a similar approach as the base LM generation ( see Section 4 . 1 ) . We also plan on using ex - plicit embeddings for individual characters in the play and using explicit entity tracking / coreference [ Clark et al . , 2018 ; Fan et al . , 2019 ] . Since the available automatic coreference tools [ e . g . , Clark and Manning , 2016 ; Lee et al . , 2017 ] are typically not trained for processing dialogic texts , they may require adaptation . 4 . 3 Synthesizing Data with Summarization Techniques The hierarchical generation approach relies on data that con - tain information of various granularity , as described in Sec - tion 4 . 2 . However , most of the available data contain only the title and the script of the play , missing other invaluable information . In our project , we intend to synthesize the miss - ing data ; synthetic data are frequently used in various tasks , such as machine translation [ Bojar and Tamchyna , 2011 ; Sennrich et al . , 2016 ] . We can generate synthetic data with the use of the classi - cal task of text summarization ; abstractive summarization in particular [ Rush et al . , 2015 ] . The main idea is to take a long document and summarize it into a few sentences , then take these synthetic data and use them for training the generative models in the hierarchical approach . With various summariz - ing models , we can ﬁrst abstract the whole script of a theatre play into a detailed synopsis , then the detailed synopsis into a short plot synopsis , and eventually the short synopsis into the play title . With these summarizing models , we can ﬁll the gaps in our datasets , so that the hierarchical generation mod - els can be trained on all theatre scripts available to us , even if they lack some or all higher - level summaries . We plan to train the Transformer model [ Vaswani et al . , 2017 ] for the summarization tasks . As we expect the amount of available training play - summary pairs to be scarce , we will pretrain our models on other sum - marization tasks , such as news abstract generation for which plenty of parallel data is available [ Straka et al . , 2018 ] , fol - lowed by ﬁne - tuning the pretrained models on our in - domain theatre data . 4 . 4 Machine Translation We plan on using machine translation ( MT ) for two purposes : ( 1 ) Since we have limited amounts of training data scattered across both English and Czech , we need the generation to take advantage of data in both languages . Therefore , we plan to generate new training data by translating either Czech texts to English or vice versa . ( 2 ) We would like the same result - ing generated play to be available instantly in both languages . Therefore , we plan to generate it in one of the languages and use MT to bring the result over to the other language . For both applications , we are going to use our in - house state - of - the - art Czech - English model [ Popel , 2018 ] . How - ever , theatre play scripts are a speciﬁc domain of data for which our MT models were not speciﬁcally trained . To tackle this problem , we will ﬁnetune [ Miceli Barone et al . , 2017 ] the general MT models on theatre parallel data . 4 . 5 Human in the Loop To ensure a satisfactory result , we intend to complement the automated generation with interventions from theatre profes - sionals , using a human - in - the - loop approach . We envision a symbiotic cooperation of human and machine where the ma - chine does most of the work but asks the human for input when necessary . The exact division of labour between the human and artiﬁcial components will emerge through time ; two likely places for human interaction are for deﬁning inputs and for picking or reranking the outputs , but other variants are also possible . Moreover , only the script of the play will be autogenerated . The subsequent realization and performance of the play will be in the hands of theatre professionals . 5 Conclusion and Future Work The project is currently at its ofﬁcial start , with some prelim - inary work done . The approaches described in this paper will be actuated throughout the course of the year 2020 . The ﬁrst automatically generated THEaiTRE play will be premiered in January 2021 , at the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the premiere of the play R . U . R . [ ˇCapek , 1920 ] . A premiere of a second play , generated from an improved version of our system , is planned for January 2022 .
