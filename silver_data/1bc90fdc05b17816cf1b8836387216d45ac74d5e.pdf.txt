This report describes different 24 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission patterns by age group in Japan . 25 Methods and findings 26 This retrospective observational case series study analyzed transmission patterns of 27 real - time polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections 28 found by local health authorities and commercial laboratories during January 14 through 29 July 31 , 2020 in Japan . After ascertaining the infection source for every symptomatic 30 case as clusters at households , daycare facilities , schools , hospitals and workplaces etc . , 31 their associated transmission patterns were analyzed . Identified cases were divided into 32 three groups : underage , < 20 ; adults , 20 – 59 ; and elderly people 60 years old and older . 33 The reproductive number ( R ) s of respective transmission directions found for the 34 respective age groups were compared . 35 Of 26 , 986 total cases , 23 , 746 unknown cases were found , leaving 3 , 240 ascertained 36 All rights reserved .

The respective Rs of underage infection sources directed to 38 underage , adult , and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0 . 0415 ( 95 % CI , 39 0 . 0138 – 0 . 0691 ) , 1 . 11 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 9171 – 1 . 3226 ) , and 0 . 2811 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 2074 – 0 . 3687 ) . 40 The respective Rs of adult infection source directed to underage , adult , and elderly 41 people were estimated respectively as 0 . 0140 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 0120 – 0 . 0162 ) , 0 . 5392 ( 95 % 42 CI , 0 . 5236 – 0 . 5550 ) , and 0 . 1135 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 1074 – 0 . 1197 ) . The respective Rs of elderly 43 infection source directed to underage , adult , and elderly people were estimated as 0 . 065 44 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 0039 – 0 . 0091 ) , 0 . 3264 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 3059 – 0 . 3474 ) , and 0 . 3991 ( 95 % CI , 45 0 . 3757 – 0 . 4229 ) . 46 Conclusions 47 The main sources of SARS - CoV - 2 infection were adults and elderly people . The R of 48 underage people directed to adults was greater than 1 because of close familial contact 49 but they were unlikely to become carriers transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 because they 50 accounted for a minority for transmissions . Apparently , SARS - CoV - 2 was transmitted 51 among adults and elderly people , suggesting that infection control of SARS - CoV - 2 52 should be managed specifically by generation . 53 54 All rights reserved .

However , the long - term negative socioeconomic effects of 64 these measures have also been considerable [ 1 ] . Adverse effects on education and 65 exercise restrictions , especially for minors , are unfathomable . Nationwide surveys 66 investigating SARS - CoV - 2 transmission patterns among children , adolescents , adults , 67 and elderly people in Japan have probably brought about a new age - dependent isolation 68 strategy without the spread of viral infection . 69 In Japan , since the first person infected with the novel coronavirus was identified on 70 January 15 , 2020 , 4 , 314 , 979 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus disease 71 ( COVID - 19 ) had been recorded by December 27 , 2020 . The death toll had risen to 72 3 , 212 in Japan by December 27 , 2020 . Of 202 , 128 infection cases , 12 , 209 ( 6 . 0 % ) were 73 of young people aged 10 – 19 ; 4 , 743 ( 2 . 3 % ) were of people younger than 10 years old on 74 December 23 , 2020 [ 2 ] . In response to the COVID - 19 pandemic , numerous countries 75 have implemented public health and social measures ( PHSM ) , including school closure 76 [ 3 ] . The Japanese government asked all schools and kindergartens to close from March 77 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Until the end of May , infection 78 continued to spread mainly among adults and elderly people . This generation - specific 79 interview survey of available nationwide data was conducted to ascertain infection 80 sources and transmission in Japan , particularly to elucidate the actual circumstances of 81 intergenerational infection and Japan’s strategic approach to respond to COVID - 19 . 82 83 Methods 84 To conduct a retrospective observational case series study analyzing publicly 85 available anonymous reports , we accessed information from local health authorities ' 86 reports released for January 15 , 2020 through July 31 , 2020 in Japan . Cases were 87 confirmed as SARS CoV - 2 positive using RT - PCR testing by local health authorities , or 88 using RT - PCR testing or other molecular testing with processing by commercial 89 laboratories . Health center staff in each prefecture investigated the status of contact with 90 each SARS CoV - 2 infected person , identified the infection source , and reported it to 91 their respective health authorities . The results are posted on the website of each 92 prefecture and are accessible by anyone . To identify asymptomatic persons , it is 93 necessary to examine all the members in clusters accurately . Invariably only a part of 94 them can be acquired . Therefore , asymptomatic persons were excluded . 95 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Different 98 distributions of sources of infection were analyzed by generation . Statistical analyses 99 were applied using software ( R ver . 5 ) . Using available information related to January 15 , 100 2020 – April 24 , 2020 , we retrospectively identified cases in which a child transmitted 101 the virus to other children in clusters at daycare facilities . Because this is a case series 102 study and because information to use was available from the websites of all prefectures 103 in Japan , no approval by an ethical committee was necessary . 104 For this study , x i , j was defined as the number of patients in i age group who were 105 infected from patients of the j age group . Particularly , i ( j ) = 1 represents an age class 106 younger than 20 years old , 2 denotes the age group of patients who were 20 years old or 107 elder than 20 years old and younger than 60 years old , and 3 stands for an age group of 108 people older than 60 years old . Additionally , i = 4 represents patients whose source of 109 infection was unidentified . 110 The source of infection of most patients was unidentified . Therefore , we assumed 111 that the age distribution of source of infection ( x i , 1 , x i , 2 and x i , 3 ) was the same among 112 patients whose source of infection was not identified ( x i , 4 ) . Then , we arranged the Table 113 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

As one might expect , it 116 was correct when i and j were not the same . However , if i and j were the same , patients 117 were also probably the source of infection to patients of the same age group . Therefore , 118 double counting occurred in the infected patients and source of infection . R i , i cannot be 119 defined correctly using this procedure . 120 The confidence interval ( CI ) of R i , j was estimated using the following method . 121 Because we do not know the probability that a patient infected one patient , the 122 probability that a patient infected two patients , or more patients , we presumed that these 123 were p , p 2 , p 3 , and so on . Then R i , j = p + 2 p 2 + 3 p 3 + … = Σ k = 1 k p k = p / ( 1 - p ) 2 . Therefore , we 124 can convert R i , j to p uniquely . We denoted p i , j as converted from R i , j . We estimated its CI 125 through bootstrapping . We first draw M = Σ k = 13 y j , k . random numbers of the uniform 126 distribution on ( 0 , 1 ) from the generator . We designate it as z m ( m = 1 , 2 , … Σ k = 13 y j , k ) . If z m 127 < p i , j , then the m - th patients infected more than one patient . Similarly , if z m < p i , j 2 , then the 128 m - th patient infected more than two patients , and so on . Therefore , Σ k = 1 k 1 [ z m < p i , j k ] 129 was the estimated number of people infected by the m - th patient , where the function of 130 1 [ ] was one if [ ] was true and zero otherwise . Similarly , Σ m = 1M Σ k = 1 k 1 [ z m < p i , j k ] was 131 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

We repeated this procedure one million times . Then we 132 obtained the one million estimator of R i , j . We sorted these variables . The duration from 133 the first 25 thousandth R i , j to the last 25 thousandth R i , should be CI of R i , j . 134 135 Results 136 The status of SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks up to November 17 , 2020 is presented in 137 Figure 1 . The period of school closures from March 2 to the end of May 2020 and that 138 of the state of emergency when the Japanese government was asking people in Japan to 139 stay home as much as possible to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is shown in 140 Figure 2 . Symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 - positive - confirmed persons are 141 also shown in Figure 2 , which shows a small number of people with symptoms and 142 most people as asymptomatic and under investigation . The SARS - CoV - 2 confirmed 143 cases comprised those of three patient age groups : underage people under 20 years old ; 144 adults 20 – 59 years old ; and elderly people 60 years old and older . Of the 26 , 986 cases 145 of SARS - CoV - 2 confirmed from January 14 through July 31 , 2020 , 3 , 240 were 146 ascertained as sources of infection . Of them , 125 ( 3 . 9 % ) were of underage people , 2 , 350 147 ( 72 . 5 % ) were of adults , and 765 ( 23 . 6 % ) were of elderly people ( Table 1 ) .

The 219 R from the underage group for adult patients confirmed to be SARS - CoV - 2 positive 220 was 1 . 11 . Only this combination was found to be greater than 1 . The R numbers in the 221 transmission clusters for which we were able to identify the infection source were 222 almost all less than 1 . 223 The basic reproduction number R 0 of SARS - CoV - 2 was first estimated as around 224 2 . 2 ( 90 % high density interval : 1 . 4 – 3 . 8 ) in China [ 4 ] . The R 0 was estimated as 2 . 56 in 225 Japan , with 95 % CI of [ 2 . 51 , 2 . 96 ] before school closure [ 5 ] . In the case of outbreak of 226 COVID - 19 in the Princess Cruise ship , an estimate of the mean reproduction number in 227 the confined setting reached values as high as approximately 11 [ 6 ] . The highest 228 reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan 229 ( 14 . 8 ) ; the estimated summary reproductive number was 2 . 87 ( 95 % CI , 2 . 39 – 3 . 44 [ 7 ] . 230 It is noteworthy that the R numbers of underage people as infection sources from 231 the COVID - 19 patients in all age groups were lower than those of adults and elderly 232 people . Rarity of underage people of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission was found . When we 233 identified patients as sources of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , hospitals , clinics and day care 234 facilities , family members , and companies each accounted for approximately one - third 235 All rights reserved .

Results show that the age distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 infection 236 sources reflects different social age - related activities . It became very difficult to 237 ascertain the infection source and the age group of infected persons because of the 238 dramatic increase in infection in adults . It remained in the very early stages of the 239 pandemic . Unfortunately , it was not possible to ascertain the infection source and the 240 age group of the infected person by type of labor during this pandemic . It might be 241 possible to do it after the end of the pandemic in the future , but it can not be done in 242 time as a countermeasure for the ongoing epidemic . Therefore , the purpose for this 243 study was to reach a certain conclusion for an analyzable research period . 244 The Japan Pediatric Society reported the Current Status of Medical Findings on 245 Novel Coronavirus Infections in Children on May 7 , 2020 . Findings up to the present 246 day for COVID - 19 indicate that it is unlikely to spread in clusters at schools and at 247 group care facilities , as it does for influenza which is a severe disease that mainly 248 affects children [ 8 ] . In our study , only four probands under the age of 20 were the 249 source of infection for persons under the age of 20 with confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 250 positivity ( Table 1a ) . Although data for positive cases in schools are limited , they have 251 not demonstrated a remarkable degree of transmission .

Gradually , it has been clarified that children 255 can escape SARS COV - 2 infection well [ 10 , 11 ] . 256 Children mainly transmitted SARS - CoV - 2 to family members . In fact , from a study 257 using epidemiologic data , 95 . 59 % ( 65 of 68 ) of infected children were found to have 258 been infected through household contact with adults [ 12 ] . A study of the dynamics of 259 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within families has indicated that children are less likely to 260 show SARS - CoV - 2 positive results than coresident adults are [ 13 ] . In addition to this 261 evidence , our study of cases and their infected and uninfected close contacts provide 262 key insights supporting epidemiologic studies of SARS - CoV - 2 . Household contacts 263 were the main transmission mode including children , but children rarely spread the 264 virus to other children and teachers at schools , kindergartens , and nursery schools . The 265 main source of infection in society is not children , but adults or senior patients with 266 SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Illness and mortality rate data vary from country to country . 267 Therefore , policies can also be expected to vary . However , because this infection is 268 mainly an adult disease , infection control of this virus should be conducted specifically 269 by generation . SARS - CoV - 2 infection among children is apparently controlled 270 sufficiently for school settings . Additional studies should be conducted to ascertain if 271 All rights reserved .

Although schools in 272 Japan have opened in earnest , household transmission was identified as a dominant 273 route of students [ 14 ] . We hope that policies will be chosen based on carefully analyzed 274 data from epidemiological surveys . 275 This study presents several important limitations . The most important limitation of 276 this paper is that it analyzes only symptomatic individuals . This is true because , to study 277 asymptomatic persons around the infected person , it is necessary to examine all the 278 contact persons of the infected person , so that only a part of the relation is invariably 279 acquired . As a result , the proportion of infected individuals is significantly lower than 280 that of symptomatic individuals . A simple sum of the two does not make sense . 281 However , it has been suggested that SARS Co - V2 is highly infectious even among 282 asymptomatic individuals . It cannot be ruled out that the asymptomatic epidemic might 283 spread in schools or nurseries if the proportion of asymptomatic children is high and 284 their infectivity is high . To confirm this point , continuous inspection of all children and 285 children at school or nursery school is necessary . No such design findings in the future 286 have been published at this time . Apparently , future consideration is necessary . 287 Second , the data we used were based solely on information obtained through interviews 288 by health center staff .

However , 290 there were 506 unknown cases other than the 341 determined cases as sources of 291 infection . Moreover , we did not measure viral loads in COVID - 19 patients in these 292 transmission clusters . Further studies should be conducted based on data accumulated 293 during a longer period until the end of the second or third wave of imported COVID - 19 294 cases in Japan . Third , because of widespread school closures during this study , most 295 opportunities for infection among children were avoided in the first place , which might 296 have contributed to the results . Of course , it cannot be denied that the chances of 297 infection among children might have decreased because of school closures and closures 298 of kindergartens . However , contact opportunities at home do not change because of 299 these closures , or by refraining from going out . Rather , the frequency of contact over 300 the ages would probably increase . In addition , contact opportunities outside of schools , 301 kindergartens , and nursery schools were not eliminated completely . It is noteworthy that 302 the examination in this paper under such circumstances is an interpretation . Therefore , 303 the conclusions in this paper will not actually hold true when schools or nurseries are 304 reopened . However , the virus is expected to be spread mainly among adults . 305 Although the only R higher than 1 was found to be that of underage people showing 306 the direction of transmission to adults , underage people constituted only a minority of 307 All rights reserved .

Adults and elderly people were widely infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . The 308 main source of SARS - CoV - 2 infection is not children , but rather adults and elderly 309 people infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . Establishment of new age - dependent isolation 310 strategies to avoid spreading the viral infection are highly anticipated . Because adults 311 transmit the disease easily to humans , if an adult infected person is found , an adult close 312 contact who is likely to become severely infected should be examined . If infected , an 313 isolation policy is taken . However , children are less likely to become severely ill and are 314 less likely to transmit the virus to similarly underaged people and elderly people . For 315 that reason , their isolation policy warrants some consideration . Only children with close 316 contact to an infected underage person with SARS - CoV - 2 should be isolated and 317 inspected .
