Hippocampus is sensitive toCORT , sinceglucocorticoidreceptorsarehighlyexpressed . Inrathippocampusﬁxedinaliving state every 3 h , we found that the dendritic spine density of CA1 pyramidal neurons increased uponwaking ( within3 h ) , ascomparedwiththespinedensityinthesleepstate . Particularly , the large - headspinesincreased . Theobservedchangeinthespinedensitymaybeduetothechange in the hippocampal CORT level , since the CORT level at awake state ( w 30 nM ) in cerebrospinal ﬂuid was higher than that at sleep state ( w 3 nM ) , as observed from our earlier study . In adrenalectomized ( ADX ) rats , such a wake - induced increase of the spine density disappeared . S . c . administrationofCORTinto ADX rats rescuedthe decreased spine density . Byusingisolated hippocampal slices , we found that the application of 30 nM CORT increased the spine density within 1 h and that the spine increase was mediated via PKA , PKC , ERK MAPK , and LIMK signaling pathways . These ﬁndings suggest that the moderately rapid increase of the spine density on waking might mainly be caused by the CORT - driven kinase networks . Key Words " corticosteroids " circadian rhythms " neuroendocrinology " brain " memory Journal of Endocrinology ( 2015 ) 226 , M13 – M27 Introduction Corticosterone ( CORT ) , known as a stress hormone , is released from the adrenal cortex , and the plasma CORT level is regulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) stimulation . ACTH is secreted from the pituitary gland in response to the arrival of the corticotropin - releasing hormone , which is released from the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus ( PVN ) . Since PVN has direct and indirect projections from the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( Buijs et al . 1993 , Vrang et al . 1995 ) , the CORT level changes in both the plasma and brain along the circadian rhythm ( Migeon et al . 1956 , Moore & Eichler 1972 , Qian et al . 2012 ) . Qian et al . showed the high synchronicity of CORT oscillation between the blood and hippocampus by using microdialysis . Our previous study showed that in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid ( CSF ) , the CORT concentration is w 30 nM in the awake state and w 3 nM in the sleep state ( Higo et al . 2011 ) . These concentrations are much lower than the stress level of CORT ( w 1 m M ) , which causes neural atrophy and memory impairments ( Woolley et al . 1990 , Krugers et al . 1997 ) . Compared to the stress level of CORT ( w 1 m M ) , the physiological functions from the lower level CORT ( w 30 nM ) almost remain unraveled .

Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 08 / 16 / 2019 08 : 07 : 17PM via free access know the role of the diurnal rise and fall of such a low level CORT in the brain . The hippocampus , the center for learning and mem - ory , is particularly sensitive to CORT ( Kim et al . 2006 , Maggio & Segal 2010 ) because glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus ( Chao et al . 1989 , Morimoto et al . 1996 ) . The hypothalamic – pituitary – adrenocortical axis ( mentioned above ) receives feedback regulation from the hippocampus ( Sapolsky et al . 1984 , Jacobson & Sapolsky 1991 ) . Recent studies show that the performance of hippocampal - dependent learning and memory ﬂuctuates along the circadian rhythm . The scores on the novel - object recognition task are higher during the dark phase ( awake state ) than during the light phase ( sleep state ) ( Ruby et al . 2008 ) . The performance of the motor skill learning ( cortex - dependent ) isalsobetterintheawakestate ( Liston et al . 2013 ) , and this diurnal change has a strong relationship with the circadian CORT oscillation . Liston et al . demonstrated that the spine ( postsynaptic structure ) formation of pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex is enhanced by circadian CORT peaks . The spinogenesis of hippocampal pyramidal neurons is also induced by the treatment of CORT on isolated hippocampal slices ( Komatsuzaki et al . 2012 , Yoshiya et al . 2013 ) . In these studies , however , 200 – 10 000 nMCORTisadministratedto increase spines , which is a much higher level than the CORT level in CSF during the circadian CORT peaks ( w 30 nM ) . Therefore , the effect from the lower physiologi - cal level of CORT on spines should be revealed . In the current study , we investigated whether the spine density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus changes along the diurnal sleep – wake cycle and whether the circadian rhythm of CORT causes it . We also examined the effect by the treatment of 30 nM CORT on the spine density in the isolated hippocampal slices . The time course of the CORT effect and its signaling cascade within the down - stream of the synaptic GR were investigated . We provided detailed understanding of how the diurnal rise in CORT inﬂuences dendritic spines in the hippocampus . Materials and methods Animals Young adult male Wistar rats ( 10 – 11 weeks old , 280 – 320 g ) were purchased from Tokyo Experimental Animals Supply ( Tokyo , Japan ) . All animals were maintained under a 12 h light : 12 h darkness cycle ( lights on at 0800 h , lights off at 2000 h ) and given free access to food and water . The rats were adapted to light – dark conditions for 1 week before the experiments . The Zeitgeber time 0 ( ZT0 ) was designated as lights on , and ZT12 was designated as lights off . Rats fall asleep around ZT0 and wake up around ZT12 . The experimental procedure of this research was approved by the Committee for Animal Research of the University of Tokyo . Chemicals Lucifer Yellow , CORT , Metyrapone , RU - 486 , Spironolac - tone , U0126 , and SP600125 were purchased from Sigma – Aldrich . Actinomycin D and cycloheximide ( CHX ) were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries ( Osaka , Japan ) . H - 89 was from Biomol ( Philadelphia , PA , USA ) . Chelerythrine and LIM kinase inhibitors were from Calbiochem ( Cambridge , MA , USA ) . Adrenalectomy and s . c . drug administration The adrenal glands from 11 - week - old male rats were removed bilaterally under deep anesthesia . The rats were given the time to recover from operations and then placed in cages with 0 . 9 % saline ( for maintaining electrolyte balance ) and food . These surgeries were performed 1 week before the experiments . Metyrapone ( 50 mg / kg body weight ) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with sesame oil to reach its appropriate concentration , enough to suppress the increase of endogenous CORT ( Roozendaal et al . 1996 ) . The ﬁnal volume was adjusted to 400 m l . S . c . administration was performed at ZT9 , 4 h before the decapitation . During the injection , the rats were gently handled by the exper - imenter . Similarly , CORT ( 1 mg / kg body weight ) was injected subcutaneously into adrenalectomized ( ADX ) rats at ZT11 , 2 h before the decapitation . Imaging and analysis of dendritic spine density Slice preparation ( from in vivo ﬁxed hippocampus ) Hippocampal slices were prepared from a 12 - week - old male rat that was deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with PBS ( 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer and 0 . 14 M NaCl , pH 7 . 3 ) , followed by a ﬁxative solution of 3 . 5 % paraformaldehyde . Immediately after decapitation , the brain was removed from the skull and post - ﬁxed with the ﬁxative solution . Hippocampal slices , 400 m m thick , were sliced with a vibratome ( Dosaka , Kyoto , Japan ) . Slice preparation ( from isolated hippocampus ) Twelve - week - old male rats were deeply anesthetized .

Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 08 / 16 / 2019 08 : 07 : 17PM via free access was performed without paraformaldehyde ﬁxation pro - cedures . Immediately after decapitation , the brain was removed from the skull and placed in ice - cold oxygenated ( 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 ) artiﬁcial CSF ( ACSF ) containing the following ( in mM ) : 124 NaCl , 5 KCl , 1 . 25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 MgSO 4 , 2 CaCl 2 , 22 NaHCO 3 , and 10 D - glucose ( all from Wako Pure Chemical Industries ) ; pH was set at 7 . 4 . Hippocampal slices , 400 m m thick , were sliced with a vibratome . During this moment , these slices were ‘fresh’ slices without the ACSF incubation . Slices were then incubated in oxygenated ACSF for 2 h ( slice recovery processes ) to obtain the widely referred ‘acute slices’ ( Supplementary Fig . S1 , see section on supplementary data givenattheendofthisarticle ) . These‘acuteslices’werethen incubated at room temperature with CORT and other drugs , including kinase inhibitors . After drug exposure , slices were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4 8 C for 4 h . Current injection of neurons by Lucifer Yellow Neurons within slices were visualized by an injection of Lucifer Yellow under a Nikon E600FN microscope ( Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with a C2400 - 79H infrared camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Shizuoka , Japan ) and 40 ! water immersion lens ( Nikon ) . A glass electrode was ﬁlled with 4 % Lucifer Yellow , which was then injected for 5 min using Axopatch 200B ( Axon Instruments , Foster City , CA , USA ) . With this process , approximately ﬁve neurons within a 100 – 200 m m depth from the surface of a slice were injected ( Huang et al . 2005 , Hanani 2012 ) . Confocal laser microscopy and spine density analysis The imaging was performed from sequential z - series scans with LSM5 PASCAL confocal microscope ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) at high zoom ( 3 . 0 ) with a 63 ! water immersion lens , NA 1 . 2 ( Zeiss ) . For Lucifer Yellow , the excitation and emission wave lengths were 488 and 515 nm respectively . For an analysis of spines , a three - dimensional image was reconstructed from w 40 sequen - tial z - series sections for every 0 . 45 m m . The applied zoom factor ( 3 . 0 ) yielded 23 pixels / 1 m m . The confocal lateral ( XY ) resolution was w 0 . 26 m m . Confocal images were then deconvoluted using AutoDeblur Software ( AutoQuant , Rockville , MD , USA ) . The density of spines was analyzed with Spiso - 3D ( mathematical and automated software calculating geometrical parameters of spines ) , developed by the Bioinformatics Project of Kawato’s group ( Mukai et al . 2011 ) . Spiso - 3D has an equivalent capacity with Neuro - lucida ( MicroBrightField , Williston , VT , USA ) , which , however , needs time - consuming manual operation . We analyzed the spines in the CA1 pyramidal neurons , along apical dendrites in stratum radiatum of the dorsal hippocampus . We chose the secondary dendrites that were 100 – 250 m m away from the soma . The spine density was calculated from the number of spines per unit length in the dendrite that had a total length of 50 – 60 m m . Spine shapes were classiﬁed into three categories as follows : i ) a small - head spine , whose head diameter is smaller than 0 . 4 m m ; ii ) a middle - head spine , which has 0 . 4 – 0 . 5 m m spine head ; and iii ) a large - head spine , whose head diameter is larger than 0 . 5 m m . These three categories were useful to compare the distribution of spine head diameters in each condition . Because the majority of spines ( O 95 % ) had a distinct head and neck , and stubby spines and ﬁlopodium did not contribute much to overall changes , we mainly analyzed spines with distinct heads . While counting the spines in the reconstructed images , the position and veriﬁcation of spines were identiﬁed by the rotation of three - dimensional reconstructions and observation of the images in consecutive single planes . Mass - spectrometric assay of CORT Detailed procedures are described elsewhere ( Hojo et al . 2009 ) . Step 1 : puriﬁcation of CORT from hippocampi with normal phase HPLC A rat was deeply anesthetized and decapitated . The whole hippocampi was removed and homogenized . To extract steroid metabolites , ethyl acetate : hexane ( 3 : 2 vol / vol ) was applied to the homogen - ates , which were then mixed . The mixture was centrifuged at 2500 g , and the organic layer was collected . After evaporation , the extracts were dissolved in 1 ml of 40 % methanol / H 2 O and applied to a Sep - Pak C 18 3 cc Vac Cartridge ( Waters , Milford , MA , USA ) . The fraction of CORT was separated using a normal phase HPLC system ( Jasco , Tokyo , Japan ) . A silica gel column ( Cosmosil 5SL , Nacalai Tesque , Kyoto , Japan ) was used . Step 2 : determination of the concentration for CORTusing liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry For determination of the concentration of CORT , the liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry ( LC – MS / MS ) system , whichconsistsoftheShimadzuHPLCsystemandan API - 5000 triple - stage quadrupole mass spectrometer ( Applied Biosystems ) , was employed . LC separation was performed on a Cadenza CD - C 18 column ( Imtakt , Kyoto , Japan ) . MS analysis was operated with electrospray ioniz - ation in positive - ion mode .

Here , m and z represent the mass and charge of CORT respectively . The limit of quantiﬁcation for CORT was 2 pg / 0 . 1 g of hippocampal tissue ( Higo et al . 2011 ) . From the calibration curve using standard CORT dissolved in blank samples , the linearity was observed between 1 and 1000 pg for CORT ( Supplementary Fig . S2 , see section on supplemen - tary data given at the end of this article ) . Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean G S . E . M .

Total spine density analysis The total spine density showed the time - dependent change as follows : 2 . 10 spines / m m ( ZT1 , 0900 h ) , 2 . 10 spines / m m ( ZT4 , 1200 h ) , 2 . 09 spines / m m ( ZT7 , 1500 h ) , 2 . 14 spines / m m ( ZT10 , 1800 h ) , 2 . 49 spines / m m ( ZT13 , 2100 h ) , 2 . 28 spines / m m ( ZT16 , 2400 h ) , 2 . 30 spines / m m ( ZT19 , 0300 h ) , and 2 . 19 spines / m m ( ZT22 , 0600 h ) ( Fig . 1B ) . The signiﬁcant increase of the spine density was observed between ZT10 and ZT13 . The spine density moderately decreased , from ZT13 to ZT19 , but was still higher than at ZT10 . The similar tendency was observed in its CORT level , higher in the awake state ( ZT12 – ZT22 ) and lower in the sleep state ( ZT1 – ZT10 ) ( Higo et al . 2011 ; Supplementary Fig . S3 , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article ) . Spine head diameter analysis The morphological changes in spine head diameter were assessed . We classiﬁed the spines into three categories using their head diameter : 0 . 2 – 0 . 4 m m as small - head spines , 0 . 4 – 0 . 5 m m as middle - head spines , and larger than 0 . 5 m m as large - head spines . Upon waking at ZT13 , the density of large - head spines was considerably increased from 0 . 77 spines / m m ( at ZT10 ) to 1 . 05 spines / m m ( Fig . 1C and D ) . The spine density for small - and middle - head spines was not signiﬁcantly altered . Depletion of circulating CORT suppressed the change of the spine density To clarify the effect of CORT on the observed diurnal change of the spine density , ADX was performed , depleting circulating CORT . In addition , metyrapone ( a speciﬁc inhibitor of CORT synthesis by P450 ( 11 b ) ) was administrated subcutaneously to eliminate the rise of CORT level upon waking . Total spine density analysis The spine density of ADX rats was examined at ZT4 and ZT13 . ADX decreased spine density at ZT13 from 2 . 49 to 2 . 09 spines / m m . ADX prevented the increase of spine density at ZT13 , whereas there was no effect at ZT4 ( Fig . 2A and B ; Supplementary Fig . S4A , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article ) . When 1 mg / kg body weight CORT was injected subcutaneously into ADX rats at ZT11 , the spine density increased at ZT13 , implying that the low spine density by ADX was rescued by CORT supplementation ( Fig . 3A and B ) . Metyrapone was administrated subcutaneously at ZT9 , 4 h before the decapitation . The treatment of metyrapone prevented the increase of the spine density at ZT13 ( 2 . 12 spines / m m ) , resulting in the same level with the sleep state ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Treatment of vehicle ( sesame oil ) showed no effect ( Supplementary Fig . S4A ) . These results support that the increase of the spine density during the awake state is induced by the elevation of CORT released from the adrenal gland . Spine head diameter analysis By ADX , the increase of the large - head spine density at ZT13 was suppressed , resulting in the same spine density for all the three subpopulations as those in intact rats at ZT4 . In addition , ADX did not affect the spine density for all three sub - populations at ZT4 ( Fig . 2C and D ) . CORT injection into ADX rats rescued the decrease of large - head spine density , resulting in the same spine density for all three subpopu - lations as those in intact rats at ZT13 ( Fig . 3C and D ) . The treatment of metyrapone prevented the increase of both the middle - and large - head spine density at ZT13 . In the control experiment , sesame oil had no effect on all three subpopulations of the spine density ( Fig . 4C and D ) , implying that the stress from the injection procedure had no effect . Determination of CORT levels in the hippocampus after the injection of CORT The concentration of CORT in the ADX rats at 2 h after the CORT injection was determined by the MS analysis . Chromatographic proﬁles for the fragmented ions of CORT ( m / z Z 121 ) showed a single peak with its retention time of 2 . 83 min ( Supplementary Fig . S5A and B , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article ) . The average concentration of CORT in the hippocampus was 23 . 7 ng / g wet weight ( 68 . 4 nM ; n Z 3 ) , slightly higher than that in the CSF of intact rats in the awake state ( w 30 nM ) . Upon CORT injection into ADX rats , the hippocampal CORT became much higher than that in ADX rats without CORT injection ( 6 . 9 nM ; Higo et al . 2011 ) . Low level CORTrapidly increased spine density in isolated hippocampal slices Since the spine density in the in vivo hippocampus changed within 3 h , we investigated the molecular mechanism of this rapid spine change by using isolated hippocampal slices .

Total spine density analysis Following a 1 - h treatment with 30 nM CORT on isolated hippocampal slices , treated dendrites had more spines ( 1 . 40 spines / m m ) than control dendrites ( 1 . 16 spines / m m ) ( Fig . 5A and B ) . It should be noted that the CORT level in control slices was w 2 nM ( Hojo et al . 2011 , Ooishi et al . 2012 ) . In the control condition , the spine density did not decline , even after 5 h ( Supplementary Fig . S6 , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article ) , indicating the slices were sufﬁciently alive . Blocking GR by 10 m M RU486 completely abolished the CORT - induced spinogenesis ( 1 . 14 spines / m m ; Fig . 6A and B ; Supplementary Fig . S4B ) . Although GR is known as a nuclear translocation receptor , the inhibition of gene transcriptions by 4 m M actinomycin D had no effect on the CORT - induced spinogenesis ( 1 . 40 spines / m m ) . CHX , an inhibitor of protein synthesis , completely abolished the CORT - induced spinogenesis ( 1 . 14 spines / m m ) at 20 m M ( Fig . 6C and Supplementary Fig . S4B ) . These results suggest that the observed CORT - induced spinogenesis is elicited by synaptic GR ( Ooishi et al . 2012 ) , which can trigger signaling cascades rapidly ( w 1 h ) . It should be noted that these blockers and inhibitors alone did not signiﬁcantly affect the spine density within experimental error ( Sup - plementary Fig . S7A and B , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article ) , indicating that the observed inhibitory effects are not simply due to the blocker’s nonspeciﬁc suppressive effects . Blocking miner - alocorticoid receptors ( MR ) by 10 m M spironolactone did not affect the spine density ( 1 . 35 spines / m m ) . Spine head diameter analysis Upon treatment with 30 nM CORT in 1 h , both the small - and middle - head spines increased signiﬁcantly ( Fig . 5C and D ) .

Blocking GR abolished the effect of CORT by dec - reasing the density of middle - head spines ( Supplementary Fig . S8A , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article ) . Inhibition of kinases suppressed CORT - induced spinogenesis To identify the kinases that are included within the downstream of GR signaling , the CORT - induced spino - genesis with co - treatments of speciﬁc inhibitors for kinases was investigated . Total spine density analysis Application of 10 m M H - 89 ( PKA inhibitor ) , 10 m M chelerythrine ( PKC inhibitor ) , 25 m M U0126 ( ERK inhibitor ) , and 10 m M LIMK inhibitor prevented the effect of 30 nM CORT ( Fig . 7A and B ; Supplementary Fig . S4B ) . On the other hand , the application of 10 m M SP600125 ( JNK inhibitor ) did not alter the effect of CORT . These results indicate that 30 nM CORT promoted the spinogenesis via PKA , PKC , ERK MAPK , and LIMK signaling pathways . Since the concen - trations of inhibitors applied are at their recommended levels ( Birnbaum et al . 2004 , Venugopal et al . 2007 , Hammond et al . 2008 , Benakanakere et al . 2010 , Scott et al . 2010 ) , the observed inhibitory effects are not artifacts due to the excess amount of inhibitors . These kinase inhibitors alone did not signiﬁcantly affect the spine density ( Supplementary Fig . S7C ) . Spine head diameter analysis Inhibiting PKA , ERK , and LIMK abolished the effect of CORT , decreasing the density of small - head spines ( Fig . 7C and D ) . Inhibiting PKC decreased the density of middle - head spines . On the other hand , inhibiting JNK had no effect on each class of the spine density , implying that these effects of kinase inhibitors were not nonspeciﬁc . 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 S p i ne den s i t y ( s p i ne s / µ m ) S p i ne den s i t y ( s p i ne s / µ m ) 0 . 2 0 . 00 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 Spine diameter ( µ m ) Small 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 S p i n e den s i t y ( s p i ne s / µ m ) 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 Middle Large 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 ZT13 _ ADX + CORT ZT13 _ ADX ZT13 ZT4 ZT4 0 . 0 5 µ m Model A B C D Spiso MAX - XY ZT13 _ ADX + CORT 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 * * * * * * ZT13 ZT13 _ ADX ZT13 _ ADX + CORT ZT13 _ ADX + CORT * * * * * * * * * ZT13 _ ADX ZT13 ZT4 Figure 3 Effect of the administration of CORT on ADX rats .

Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 08 / 16 / 2019 08 : 07 : 17PM via free access Discussion The current study showed that the spine density of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus changed along the circadian cycles of the CORT level . The moderately rapid increase of the spine density from the sleep state to the awake state is probably induced by the rise in CORT level . Such a moderately rapid spine increase might be induced by kinase signaling , including PKA PKC , ERK MAPK , and LIMK . Diurnal change of spine density in the hippocampus and cortex The observed increase in spine density ( w 20 % ) in the hippocampus could facilitate memory performance ( Leuner & Shors 2004 , Luine & Frankfurt 2012 ) , and the spine increase may have a correlation with the diurnal change of the hippocampal - dependent memory perform - ance ( Ruby et al . 2008 ) . The change of the spine density along the sleep – wake cycle is also observed in the cortex , including infralimbic cortex layer III ( Perez - Cruz et al . 2009 ) , sensorimotor cortex layer V ( Maret et al . 2011 ) , barrel cortex layer V ( Yang & Gan 2012 ) , and primary cerebral cortex layer II / III ( Hayashi et al . 2013 ) . In these studies , the spine density increases also in the awake state and decreases in the sleep state , probably resulting in the diurnal change of the cortex - dependent memory performance ( Liston et al . 2013 ) . However , the detailed mechanisms are not clariﬁed . By ADX and the s . c . administration of metyrapone , we demonstrated that the rise in CORT level upon waking increased spine density in the hippocampus . Perez - Cruz et al . ( 2009 ) show that the chronic restraint stress diminishes the wake - induced increase of the spine density in the cortex .

Contribution of slow effects of GR to spine changes may be weak GR is known as a nuclear translocation receptor , regulat - ing gene transcriptions and protein syntheses . These processes may take 5 – 6 h , which is slower than the moderately rapid spine increase that appeared within 3 h ( from ZT10 to ZT13 ) , for in vivo ﬁxed hippocampus ( Fig . 1 ) . From DNA microarray analysis , the genes that were regulated by CORT in the hippocampus are investigated comprehensively ( Morsink et al . 2006 ) . mRNAs of typical synaptic proteins , including NMDA - R , AMPA - R , PSD95 , synapsin I , and synaptophisin , were not changed within 5 h , upon CORT treatment . These results suggest that the observed moderately rapid increase ( ! 3 h ) in spine density upon waking may be too rapid to slow genomic effects of GR but might be driven by rapid kinase - driven effects as observed in isolated hippocampal slices . Rapid spine increase by physiologically low level CORT CORT - induced rapid spinogenesis via synaptic GR and kinases In isolated hippocampal slices , the application of 30 nM CORT , approximately the same level with that in the CSF during the awake state ( Higo et al . 2011 ) , increased the spine density within 1 h , from the control slices with a CORT level of w 2 nM . The effect of CORT was blocked by RU486 , implying that CORT effect was mediated by GR . Since RU486 suppresses not only GR but also progesterone receptor ( PR ) , progesterone ( PROG ) effect should be considered . The treatment of slices with 10 nM PROG ( an approximately equal level in hippocampus ( Hojo et al . 2009 ) ) for 1 h did not signiﬁcantly increase the spine MAX - XY Control CORT _ 1 h 5 µ m A B C D Spiso Model MAX - XY Spiso Model 0 . 7 0 . 6 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 S p i ne den s i t y ( s p i ne s / µ m ) S p i ne de n s i t y ( s p i ne s / µ m ) S p i ne den s i t y ( s p i ne s / µ m ) 0 . 00 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 Spine diameter ( µ m ) Small 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 * * * * * * * 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 Middle Control ( 1 h ) CORT _ 1 h CORT _ 2 h CORT _ 3 h Control ( 1 h ) CORT _ 1 h CORT _ 2 h CORT _ 3 h Large Control ( 1 h ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 * * * * CORT _ 1 h CORT _ 2 h CORT _ 3 h Figure 5 Time dependency of CORT effects on the spine density in isolated hippocampal slices .

GR has been observed to localize within the postsyn - aptic structures with postembedding immunogold stain - ing ( Komatsuzaki et al . 2012 , Ooishi et al . 2012 ) , and there is increasing evidence that membrane - located GR could rapidly modulate synaptic functions by directly activating protein kinases pathways ( Maggio & Segal 2010 , Groeneweg et al . 2012 ) . The current CORT - induced spinogenesis required PKA , PKC , ERK , and LIMK . Membrane GR - induced rapid PKA activation ( w 1 h ) has been demonstrated in rat the basolateral amygdala and prefrontal cortex ( Roozendaal et al . 2002 , Barsegyan et al . 2010 ) , and the relationship between GR activity and PKC also been shown ( Liu & Chen 1995 , ffrench - Mullen 1995 ) . Both rapid ERK / MAPK activation ( w 15 min ) and LIMK activation ( w 20 min ) through GR have been demonstrated in the hippocampal slices and cultures of hippocampal neurons ( Jafari et al . 2012 , Liston et al . 2013 ) . Downstream cascade of the kinase networks In hippo - campal neurons , there may be a phosphorylation path - way : PKC / RhoA / ROCK / LIMK ( Pilpel & Segal 2004 , Shi et al . 2009 ) . LIMK phosphorylates coﬁlin , an actin - associated protein , resulting in assembly of actin cyto - skeletal matrices ( Yang et al . 1998 , Bernstein & Bamburg 2010 , Yuen et al . 2011 ) . GR modulation of spine morphology via LIMK and the coﬁlin dependent pathway is shown in primary cultured hippocampal neurons ( Liston et al . 2013 ) . In the CA1 region , ERK cascade is known to couple with PKA and PKC via PKA / B - Raf / ERK , PKC / Raf1 / ERK in synaptic modulation ( Roberson et al . 1999 ) . One of the targets of ERK in spine reorganization might be cortactin , since ERK is known to phosphorylate cortactin , an actin - associated protein ( Martinez - Quiles et al . 2004 ) .

Taken together , we can propose the schematic illustration of the CORT signaling pathway as shown in Fig . 8 . Through this pathway , the rise in the CORT level upon waking may increase the spine density in the hippocampus . Comparison between in vivo hippocampus and in isolated hippocampal slices Diurnal change of CORT level in the in vivo hippocam - pus Circulating CORT level changes along the circadian rhythm ( Migeon et al . 1956 , Moore & Eichler 1972 ) . The diurnal change of the CORT level in the hippocampus has also been shown by using the microdialysis in combination with RIA ( Linthorst & Reul 2008 , Qian et al . 2012 ) . These studies , however , did not show the absolute CORT concentration in the hippocampus . On the other hand , our previous study showed the diurnal change of the CORT level in the CSF : w 30 nM in the awake state and w 3 nM in the sleep state ( Higo et al . 2011 ; Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . The concentration was determined with LC – MS / MS quantitatively . Therefore , we applied 30 nM CORT to investigate the effect from the rise in CORT upon waking .

It was also demon - strated that after the s . c . injection of 1 mg / kg body weight CORT , the CORT level was elevated for 15 – 120 min in the hippocampus ( Droste et al . 2008 ) . Conditions in isolated hippocampal slices The isolated hippocampal slices , used for the spine analysis , have very low CORT because CORT was leaked to the ACSF during the incubation . The CORT level was w 2 nM , which was determined by the MS analysis ( Hojo et al . 2011 , Komatsuzaki et al . 2012 , Ooishi et al . 2012 ) . Following an exposure to anesthesia and the sacriﬁce of rats , a high - dose of CORT ( w 1 m M ) is secreted from the adrenal cortex and readily reaches the brain . Therefore , the CORT concen - tration in the freshly isolated hippocampus was 150 – 500 nM ( Komatsuzaki et al . 2012 ) . Incubation for 2 h is enough to wash out such a high level of CORT from hippocampal slices ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . For these reasons , the current spinogenesis occurred upon the increase in the CORT level from w 2 nM ( control ) to 30 nM . We have found that even 10 nM CORT is enough to increase the spine density ( Supplementary Fig . S9 , see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article ; Higo et al . 2011 ) . The spine density of isolated hippocampal slices ( Figs 5 , 6 and 7 ) is signiﬁcantly lower than the spine density of in vivo ﬁxed hippocampus ( Figs 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) . This may be due to the slicing with ice - cold water . Spines are known to disappear transiently when the cooled hippocampus is sliced ( Kirov et al . 2004 ) . Through recovery incubation of the slices for 2 h at room temperature , the spine density may increase to some extent . Perfusion ﬁxation of the hippocampus in vivo was performed at body temperature ( w 37 8 C ) , much warmer than the ﬁxation temperature of isolated hippo - campal slices , preserving more spines . Concentration - dependent functions of non - stress level of CORT in the hippocampus The rapid functions of low level CORT have been reported in several studies . In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neur - ons , 100 nM of CORT facilitates the long - term poten - tiation induced by high - frequency stimulation ( Wiegert et al . 2006 ) , and 10 – 100 nM of CORT rapidly enhances the mEPSC frequency concentration dependently ( Karst et al . 2005 ) . This enhancement was via MR , whereas 30 nM CORT - induced spinogenesis in the current study was not via MR but via GR . Since the afﬁnity of GR for CORT is sufﬁciently high ( dissociation constant K d , 2 . 5 – 5 nM ; Reul & de Kloet 1985 ) , GR is activated signiﬁcantly by 30 nM CORT . An inverted U - shape effect of CORT , including the amplitude of the population spike , is known to be weakened with the increase of CORT concentration above a certain threshold ( w 50 nM ) , whereas this effect is enhanced with the increase of CORT below the threshold ( Diamond et al . 1992 ) .

Upon binding of CORT , GR induces the sequential activation of PKA , PKC , ERK MAPK , and LIMK . LIMK phosphorylates coﬁlin , resulting in actin reorganization and subsequent spinogenesis , whereas ERK / MAPK phosphorylates cortactin .

Physiological importance of the circadian rhythms of spine and CORT Several studies have shown that memory performance depends on circadian rhythm ( Eckel - Mahan & Storm 2009 ) . The score of the novel recognition task , the hippocampal - dependent memory test , shows diurnal change , higher in the awake state than in the sleep state ( Ruby et al . 2008 ) . In this study , the rhythm for memory performance is abolished by the disruption of the circadian system , most likely resulting in the disruption of CORT rhythm . The score of the rotarod motor learning task , which is dependent on motor cortex , is higher when training occurs during the circadian CORT peak than during the trough ( Liston et al . 2013 ) . The disruption of the CORT rhythm by the administration of CORT diminished the newly formed spines following motor training , resulting in impaired memory performance . This indicates that the rhythm of CORT not only increases spines but also supports the survival of newly formed spines . Other studies showed that the spatial memory ( which is hippocampal dependent ) and working memory ( which is prefrontal cortex dependent ) were impaired by ADX ( Conrad et al . 1997 , Mizoguchi et al . 2004 ) . Furthermore , ADX rats show depression - like behavior in the rotarod test ( Mizoguchi et al . 2008 ) . Such memory and cognitive impairments are rescued by the regeneration of CORT rhythm by the combination of implant of the CORT pellet and oral CORT treatment , only during the awake phase . Even in humans , the retrieval of emotional and neutral texts is impaired by the suppression of the morning rise in cortisol ( Rimmele et al . 2010 ) . The current results are useful to explain the mechanisms of these diurnal changes of memory performance .
