However , the underlying mecha - nisms are not clear . Mg 2 + is the most abundant intracellular divalent cation in the body and plays critical roles in many cell functions . We investigated the effect of bFGF on the intracellular Mg 2 + concentration ( [ Mg 2 + ] i ) in human umbili - cal vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . bFGF increased [ Mg 2 + ] i in a dose - dependent manner , independent of ex - tracellular Mg 2 + . This bFGF - induced [ Mg 2 + ] i increase was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tyrphostin A - 23 and genistein ) , phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors ( wortmannin and LY294002 ) and a phospholipase C γ ( PLC γ ) inhibitor ( U73122 ) . In contrast , mitogen - activated protein kinase inhibitors ( SB202190 and PD98059 ) did not affect the bFGF - induced [ Mg 2 + ] i increase . These results suggest that bFGF increases the [ Mg 2 + ] i from the intracellu - lar Mg 2 + stores through the tyrosine kinase / PI3K / PLC γ - dependent signaling pathways . = INTRODUCTION The family of fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) currently consists of 22 structurally related polypeptides , including the two proto - types , FGF - 1 ( acidic FGF ) and - 2 ( basic FGF , bFGF ) ( Ornitz and Itoh , 2001 ; Powers = et al . , 2000 ) . Basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) is a potent mitogen that regulates angiogenesis during tumor angiogenesis , growth and development ( Folkman and Shing , 1992 ; Giavazzi = et al . , 2001 ) . bFGF also has the potential to improve collateral angiogenesis in human myocar - dial and lower leg ischemia ( Laham = et al K , 2000 ; Lazarous = et al K , 2000 ) . However , the underlying mechanisms are not clear . The binding of bFGF to its receptors induces dimerization and sub - sequent phosphorylation of the receptors through the activation of tyrosine kinase receptors ( Klint and Claesson - Welsh , 1999 ; Schlessinger , 2000 ) , which leads to the activation of several intracellular signaling molecules such as mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , and phospholipase C γ ( PLC γ ) ( Klint and Claesson - Welsh , 1999 ; Webber = et al . , 2005 ) . Magnesium is the most abundant intracellular divalent cation , and plays essential roles in a wide range of fundamental cellu - lar reactions ( Wolf and Cittadini , 2003 ) . Since magnesium func - tions as an allosteric modulator of several enzymes or bridges structurally distinct molecules , magnesium coordinates DNA duplication with an adequate metabolic response . Considering the various functions of magnesium , it is not surprising that many pathological symptoms and diseases are attributed to alterations of Mg 2 + homeostasis . A low magnesium status has been found to be important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascu - lar diseases such as hypertension and thrombosis ( Liao = et al . , 1998 ; Mussoni = et al . , 2001 ; Peacock = et al . , 1999 ) . All these clinical features are known to be associated with endothelial dysfunction as a common pathogenic event ( Cines = et al . , 1998 ; Maier = et al . , 2004b ) . Additionally , Lapidos et al . ( 2001 ) reported that Mg 2 + promoted the spreading and migration of endothelial cells . However , the regulation of intracellular Mg 2 + concentra - tions ( [ Mg 2 + ] i ) has not been well characterized compared to intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations . Furthermore , there is no re - port on the effect of bFGF on [ Mg 2 + ] i . In the present study , we investigated the effects of bFGF on the [ Mg 2 + ] i in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) and clarified its underlying mechanisms . We found that bFGF increased [ Mg 2 + ] i from the intracellular stores through the acti - vation of the tyrosine kinase / PI3K / PLC γ - dependent signaling pathways in HUVECs .

The effects of bFGF ( 10 ng / ml ) on [ Mg 2 + ] i in the absence ( Ab ) or presence ( Aa ) of extracellular Mg 2 + ( 1 mM MgCl 2 ) in HU - VECs loaded with mag - fura - 2 AM . ( A ) Representative tracings . The arrows indicate the starting point of the perfusion with bFGF . ( B ) Average values of the percentage increases of [ Mg 2 + ] i in each group . The percentage increases of [ Mg 2 + ] i were normalized to the basal level immediately before the perfusion with bFGF . Each column with a vertical bar denotes the means ± SEM . bFGF , tyrphostin A - 23 , wortmannin , LY294002 , U73122 , U73343 , SB202190 , and PD98059 were from Merck Biosciences ( Ger - many ) . Collagenase type II was obtained from Worthington ( USA ) . The remaining reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical ( USA ) . Cell culture HUVECs were prepared from human umbilical cords by colla - genase digestion , as described previously ( Hong = et al K , 2006 ) . HUVECs were maintained in M - 199 medium supplemented with 20 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . The primary cultured cells used in this study were between passages 2 and 4 . The ethics committee of Chonbuk National University Medical School approved this study , the subjects were fully informed , and we obtained a written consent from them . This study con - formed with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki . Fluorimetric determination of the [ Mg 2 + ] i HUVECs were grown on collagen - coated glass coverslips and incubated with 5 μ M mag - fura - 2 / AM for 60 min at 37 ° C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . After washing the cells with a extracellular solu - tion , the coverslip was transferred into the measuring chamber on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope ( Nikon , Japan ) , and the cells were continuously perfused with the ex - tracellular solution at 37 ° C . The fluorescence ratios were ob - tained by exciting the dye at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and collecting at wavelength of 475 nm emission , and these values were converted to [ Mg 2 + ] i by áå = ëáíì calibration ( Raju = et al . , 1989 ) . The extracellular solution contained 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 or 0 mM MgCl 2 , 11 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 35 with NaOH ) . = Statistical analysis All results are presented as means ± SEM . Comparisons were made between the different treatments using the Student ’ s í - test . Differences were considered significant at m < 0 . 05 . RESULTS The effects of bFGF on [ Mg 2 + ] i in HUVECs We first tested whether bFGF alters [ Mg 2 + ] i in the HUVECs . Figure 1A shows the effect of bFGF on [ Mg 2 + ] i in the HUVECs A B Fig . 2 .

The arrows indicate the starting points of the perfusion with various doses of bFGF . ( B ) Dose - response curve fitted with a Hill equation . The data are expressed as means ± SEM . in the presence or absence of extracellular Mg 2 + ( 1 mM MgCl 2 ) . The mean basal level of [ Mg 2 + ] i in the HUVECs was 0 . 51 ± 0 . 04 mM in the presence of extracellular Mg 2 + ( å = 48 ) . The level of [ Mg 2 + ] i started to increase in HUVECs at approximately 5 min after bFGF ( 10 ng / ml ) treatment , and reached a maximum level approximately 25 min after bFGF treatment . The bFGF - induced increase of [ Mg 2 + ] i was 155 . 2 ± 40 . 2 % ( n = 6 ) or 140 . 3 ± 52 . 2 % ( n = 6 ) of the basal [ Mg 2 + ] i level in the presence or absence of extracellular Mg 2 + , respectively . These results indicate that the bFGF - induced increase of [ Mg 2 + ] i was mainly due to releasing Mg 2 + from the intracellular stores . Therefore , the subsequent experiments in the study were performed with bFGF in the absence of extracellular Mg 2 + . bFGF also increased [ Mg 2 + ] i in a dose - depen - dent manner with an EC 50 of 12 . 01 ± 1 . 03 ng / ml and the Hill coefficient of 1 . 63 ± 0 . 21 ( n = 6 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . To rule out the Ca 2 + - induced fluorescence in our experimen - tal system , we examined the effect of bFGF on the [ Mg 2 + ] i level in the presence or absence of a Ca 2 + chelator BAPTA - AM ( Fig . 3A ) . In the presence or absence of a Ca 2 + chelator BAPTA - AM , the bFGF - induced increase of [ Mg 2 + ] i was 147 . 3 ± 32 . 3 % ( å = 6 ) and 142 . 5 ± 24 . 1 % ( å = 6 ) of the basal [ Mg 2 + ] i level , respec - tively . This result indicates that a fluorescence change in HU - VECs loaded with mag - fura 2 - AM by bFGF reflects the change in [ Mg 2 + ] I only . It is well known that Mg 2 + movement across the cell membrane is dependent on the concentration of Na + ( Schweigel = et al K , 2006 ; Tashiro = et al K , 2005 ; Zhang and Melvin , 1996 ) . Therefore , we tested whether the bFGF - induced [ Mg 2 + ] i increase was Na + - dependent ( Fig . 3B ) . bFGF increased [ Mg 2 + ] i
