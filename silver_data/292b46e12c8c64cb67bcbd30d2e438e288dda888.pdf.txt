SARS - CoV - 2 circulated predominantly in 80 + year old individuals across all time periods except between the first and second COVID - 19 wave and in 20 – 30 year old individu - als before the second COVID - 19 wave . In contrast to the first wave , a significantly higher positivity ratio was observed for the 20 – 40 age group in addition to the 80 + age group com - pared to the other age groups during the second wave . The median viral load follows a simi - lar temporal evolution as the positivity rate with an increase ahead of the second wave and highest viral loads observed for 80 + year old individuals . Conclusion There was a high SARS - CoV - 2 circulation among asymptomatic patients with a predomi - nance and highest viral loads observed in the elderly . Moreover , ahead of the second COVID - 19 wave an increase in median viral load was noted with the highest overall positivity ratio observed in 20 – 30 year old individuals , indicating they could have been the hidden driv - ers of this wave . Introduction The incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infections in the Belgian community is currently estimated based on real - time reverse transcriptase poly - merase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) and rapid antigen test results of patients with coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) - like symptoms and , to a lesser extent , of individuals with epidemiological arguments for testing . Large studies reported however that 1 – 13 % of SARS - CoV - 2 infected individuals remain asymptomatic with smaller studies reporting even higher proportions ( up to 88 % ) [ 1 ] . Real - time RT - PCR is considered the reference standard for SARS - CoV - 2 detec - tion with lower cycle threshold ( Ct ) values corresponding to higher viral RNA concentrations and higher infectiousness [ 2 ] . Some studies reported lower SARS - CoV - 2 viral loads in the nasopharynx / oropharynx of asymptomatic patients ( children and adults ) with shorter viral shedding compared to symptomatic patients [ 3 – 7 ] . Other studies observed similar viral loads in respiratory tract samples from asymptomatic or pre - symptomatic persons compared to symptomatic patients and long - term virus shedding in asymptomatic patients [ 2 , 8 – 10 ] . In addition , the isolation of cultivable virus from persons with asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion has been described [ 2 , 8 ] . Based on the observed dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 viral loads in upper respiratory tract specimen and the incubation period for COVID - 19 , a substantial pro - portion of pre - symptomatic transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 is probable [ 2 , 11 – 13 ] . The asymp - tomatic and pre - symptomatic cases may represent an important source of potentially transmissible virus whose early identification may help in controlling the community spread of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 1 , 2 , 8 , 14 , 15 ] . In addition to the lack of inclusion of asymptomatic cases in the current surveillance data , the proportion of individuals who do have symptoms or epidemiological risk factors that are being tested is estimated to be far below 100 % [ 16 – 18 ] . More specifically , overall underreport - ing factors ( total SARS - CoV - 2 infections vs . confirmed COVID - 19 cases ) of 33 ( 95 % credible interval ( CrI ) : 32 . 0 – 34 . 7 , on March 22 , 2020 ) , 9 ( on 12 April 2020 ) and 3 . 5 ( on 7 June 2020 ) have been estimated for the early phase of the epidemic in Belgium based on a stochastic com - partmental modeling approach [ 19 ] . Surveillance of SARS - CoV - 2 community spread based on PLOS ONE SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio and viral load amongasymptomatic individuals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0259908 November11 , 2021 2 / 18 Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterestsexist . these test results leads subsequently to a substantial underestimation of the true population incidence and a delayed image of the epidemiological situation . Accurate and up - to - date knowledge of the true size of the epidemic is however essential for timely and efficient implementation of measures to control SARS - CoV - 2 community spread [ 15 , 20 ] . To date , no data are available concerning asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 carriership and viral loads in the general Belgian population nor at the regional level . Furthermore , the role of the different age categories in the viral spread has not been fully elucidated [ 21 ] . The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of the SARS - CoV - 2 ( RT ) - PCR posi - tivity ratio and distribution of viral loads within a cohort of asymptomatic patients screened prior hospitalization or surgery , stratified by age category . Materials and methods We retrospectively studied data on real - time RT - PCR detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in respiratory tract samples of asymptomatic patients collected in nine Belgian hospitals located in Flanders over a 12 - month period ( from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 ) . The hospitals ZiekenhuisNet - werk Antwerpen ( ZNA , Antwerp ) , GemeenschapsZusters Antwerpen ( GZA , Antwerp ) , Ant - werp University Hospital ( UZA , Antwerp ) , Heilig Hart Hospital ( Lier ) , Sint - Maarten Hospital ( Mechelen ) , Ghent University Hospital ( Ghent ) , University Hospitals Leuven ( Leuven ) , Jessa Hospital ( Hasselt ) and Sint - Jan Hospital ( Bruges ) participated in this study , representing the five Flemish provinces . During the study period , all patients requiring hospitalization for indi - cations other than COVID - 19 and all patients requiring a surgical procedure in one of the nine participating hospitals were screened with SARS - CoV - 2 real - time RT - PCR on a nasopha - ryngeal or combined oropharyngeal / nasal specimen as part of the standard hospital infection control protocol . Screenings of high / low risk contacts or individuals with symptoms were excluded , as well as non - risk related screenings when they could not be distinguished from risk - related data ( for example , data from Sint - Jan Hospital in the period December and Janu - ary were excluded since extensive hospital staff screenings were also included and not exclud - able from the data set ) . The patient information from each hospital is summarized in Table 1 together with the viral RNA extraction procedures and the SARS - CoV - 2 real - time RT - PCR assays performed in each of the included hospitals . In addition to the real - time RT - PCR result , the parameters postal code , age and RT - PCR Ct - value ( for positive results if available ) were retrieved from the laboratory information system of each hospital . The conversion of Ct - values to viral loads was performed taking into account a conversion factor based on the measurement of standards on each RT - PCR system in each participating hospital . A viral load of � 5log RNA copies / mL was defined as strongly positive . The evolution of the overall SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio and median viral load over time was visually represented per month . In order to put these numbers in perspective , we have added the number of new hospitalizations and positivity ratio in the general Flemish popula - tion over time for the provinces of Limburg , Antwerp , East Flanders , West Flanders and Flem - ish Brabant combined , as reported online by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health , Sciensano [ 22 ] . Also the Oxford stringency index together with the time at which important mitigation measures were put into place are showed [ 23 , 24 ] . Furthermore , positivity ratios were compared between different provinces and age groups ( ten - year age groups , except for the oldest age category including patients of 90 years and above , denoted by 90 + ) and the distributions of viral loads in these provinces and age groups were visualized .

In order to describe the trends in the observed SARS - CoV - 2 positivity data , we used a flexible generalized additive model ( GAM ) including age ( in years ) , time ( in days ) and province ( Limburg , Ant - werp , East Flanders , West Flanders and Flemish Brabant ) as covariates [ 25 ] . More specifically , we used a binomial GAM with logit - or complementary log - log link function to describe the nonlinear evolution of the positivity ratio and we compared different models based on the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) . Next to ( smooth functions of the continuous ) covariates , we considered two - and three - way interaction effects in the model building procedure . The final model results are presented graphically in the results section . Similarly , we use a GAM with underlying normal distribution ( and identity link ) to model the evolution of log - trans - formed viral loads over time . Statistical significance was defined based on a two - sided p - value smaller than 0 . 05 . Statisti - cal analyses were performed using the free statistical software program R [ 26 ] . Data from all centers were fully anonymized before processing . Ethical approval was obtained by the local Ethics Committees of the participating hospitals ( ZNA n˚ 5416 , Antwerp University Hospital n˚ 20 / 36 / 462 , GemeenschapsZusters Antwerpen n˚ 200906RETRO , University Hospitals Leu - ven N˚ S64903 , General Hospital Sint - Jan n˚ 2864 , Jessa General Hospital n˚ f / 2020 / 176 , Heilig Hart Hospital n˚ 2021 . 06 , General Hospital Sint - Maarten n˚ EC2127 ) . Results In total , 255925 SARS - CoV - 2 real - time RT - PCR test results , obtained from patients domiciled in the Flemish provinces Antwerp ( 99030 test results of which 1082 ( 1 . 09 % ) were positive ) , East Flanders ( 18653 ; 197 ( 1 . 06 % ) positive ) , West Flanders ( 54783 ; 1331 ( 2 . 43 % ) positive ) , Limburg ( 36049 ; 296 ( 0 . 82 % ) positive ) and Flemish Brabant ( Leuven Arrondissement ; 47410 ; 340 ( 0 . 72 % ) positive ) ( i . e . , postal codes 2000 – 2999 , 3000 – 3999 , 8000 – 8999 and 9000 – 9999 ) , were included in this study . Overall , we observe large differences in positivity ratio across the different Flemish provinces . The number of tests performed by each hospital are , in decreasing order , 66204 ( University Hospitals Leuven ) , 54908 ( Sint - Jan Hospital ) , 41431 ( Gemeenschaps - Zusters Antwerpen ) , 28724 ( Jessa Hospital ) , 26708 ( Antwerp University Hospital ) , 12246 ( Sint - Maarten Hospital ) , 12016 ( Ghent University Hospital ) , 7350 ( Heilig Hart Hospital ) and 6338 ( ZiekenhuisNetwerk Antwerpen ) . In the remainder of the manuscript , we will refer to province as the reported province of residence of each of the individual patients . Furthermore , 2421 positive test results for which a viral load measurement was reported were considered for further analysis . The median age of tested patients was 54 years ( first and third quartile 33 and 69 years , respectively ) . We included the following number of patients from each age category : 5 % ( N = 12067 ) [ 0 , 10 ) years , 6 % ( N = 14503 ) [ 10 , 20 ) years , 10 % ( N = 25246 ) [ 20 , 30 ) years , 13 % ( N = 32584 ) [ 30 , 40 ) years , 11 % ( N = 28732 ) [ 40 , 50 ) years , 15 % ( N = 38946 ) [ 50 , 60 ) years , 16 % ( N = 41423 ) [ 60 , 70 ) years , 14 % ( 36667 ) [ 70 , 80 ) years , 8 % ( N = 21186 ) [ 80 , 90 ) years and 2 % ( N = 4571 ) 90 + years . An unweighted overall SARS - CoV - 2 real - time RT - PCR positivity ratio of 1 . 27 % ( 3246 / 255925 ) among all a - / pre - symptomatic patients who were screened pre - hospitalization or pre - surgery was observed . In Fig 1 , we graphically depict the evolution of the SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio per month in our study population ( overall ( black dots and dashed line ) and by province ) and the general Flemish population ( Sciensano data ) between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021 . Also the observed daily number of new hospitalizations in Flanders ( pink shaded area ) and the Belgian Oxford stringency index together with the time at which important mitigation measures ( gray ) were put into place are displayed within this time period . From the graph , it is clear that in spite of regional differences ( i . e . , between provinces ) the evolution of the positivity ratio in PLOS ONE SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio and viral load amongasymptomatic individuals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0259908 November11 , 2021 5 / 18 PLOS ONE SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio and viral load amongasymptomatic individuals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0259908 November11 , 2021 6 / 18 our study population resembles the evolution in hospitalizations . A similar temporal evolution is observed between the positivity ratio in our study population and the one in the general Flemish population , except that the SARS - CoV - 2 peak occurred earlier for the latter ( October instead of November 2020 ) . Before the second wave in October 2020 , the stringency index was 47 – 53 ( September to beginning of October ) with the most important relaxation of stringent measures being the reopening of the schools at the first of September 2020 . Based on the unweighted overall positivity ratio ( black dots ) , the highest peak % SARS - CoV - 2 carriership was observed during the first and second Belgian COVID - 19 wave ( i . e . , 3 . 59 % in April and 3 . 00 % in November 2020 ) . Regional differences in SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio are also shown in Fig 1 with the highest percentages of positive tests observed in West Flanders ( orange points ) during the first COVID - 19 wave and second COVID - 19 wave . There is a large percentage of positive tests observed in West Flanders in February 2021 ( possibly already to be observed from December given the omission of part of the data from Sint - Jan Hospital ) , which is different from the SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratios in the other provinces . A more granular look at the evolution of the SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio over time in terms of bi - weekly percentages and by province can be found in S1 Fig . The highest overall positivity ratio is observed in the age groups 90 + ( 2 . 8 % ) , [ 80 , 90 ) ( 1 . 8 % ) and [ 20 , 30 ) ( 1 . 9 % ) ( 0 . 9 – 1 . 4 % for the other age groups ) . Age - specific SARS - CoV - 2 carriership over time is graphically depicted in Fig 2 . More specifically , we show the monthly evolution of the percentage of SARS - CoV - 2 positive patients that were screened pre - hospitalization or pre - surgery and without COVID - 19 symptoms by ten - year age group . Combining data from the entire time period , there exists a significant difference in positivity ratio across different age groups ( Chi - square p - value < 0 . 0001 ) . A comparison of the monthly positivity ratios among age groups indicates significant differences in each month , except for June and July in which no significant pairwise differences were observed . From the figure , one can clearly observe that the highest percentage of positive tests is observed in the [ 80 , 90 ) and 90 + age groups over the entire time period ( except for the summer period including July , August and September ) . SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratios were significantly different in the 80 + year old across all time periods , except for the abovementioned summer months , as compared to their younger coun - terparts based on pairwise Chi - square tests . More specifically , during April 2020 a significantly different positivity ratio was observed in each of the age groups [ 80 , 90 ) and 90 + compared with the age groups [ 0 , 10 ) , [ 10 , 20 ) , [ 30 , 40 ) and [ 50 , 60 ) ( Fisher’s exact BH adjusted p - values < 0 . 036 ) with higher positivity ratios for the elderly . Moreover , in May , the positivity ratio in all age groups , except for [ 20 , 30 ) and [ 80 , 90 ) , was found to be significantly different from the positivity ratio in the highest age group . In August , prior to the onset of the second COVID - 19 wave , the positivity ratio was estimated to be highest in the youngest age groups with a significant difference in positivity ratio as compared to the one in older age groups between 30 and 90 years of age . Moreover , the virus circulated predominantly in the age group [ 20 , 30 ) before the second wave emerged ( August—September 2021 ) . The positivity ratio increased in all age groups between September and October 2020 . During October 2020 , the positivity ratio was found to be highest in the age groups [ 20 , 30 ] and [ 30 , 40 ) , being signifi - cantly different from positivity ratios in the age groups [ 50 , 60 ) , [ 60 , 70 ) and [ 70 , 80 ) .

After December 2020 , only in February 2021 significant differences in positivity ratio were detected with significantly different values in age groups [ 20 , 30 ) , [ 30 , 40 ) , [ 40 , 50 ) , and 80 + on the one hand and all other age categories on the other hand . The SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio is not significantly different between wave 1 ( i . e . April 2020 ) and wave 2 ( i . e . October— November 2020 ) for all age groups , except for [ 60 , 70 ) ( Fisher’s exact BH corrected p - value = 0 . 001 ) , [ 70 , 80 ) ( p - value = 0 . 003 ) and [ 80 , 90 ) ( p - value = 0 . 002 ) . Throughout the course of the epidemic , SARS - CoV - 2 positivity was found to be smallest in the youngest age groups ( i . e . , [ 0 , 10 ) , [ 10 , 20 ) ) , albeit that these percentages were considerably higher in August 2020 and March 2021 . The general evolution of the ( log - transformed ) viral load over time ( by month ) as well as the evolution of the proportion of strongly positive patients among all PCR positive patients ( i . e . , � 5log RNA copies / mL ) is illustrated in Fig 3 . The median viral load follows a similar tem - poral evolution as was seen in the positivity rate . Overall , the median log - transformed viral loads were significantly different over time ( Kruskal - Wallis two - sided p - value < 0 . 0001 ) . More specifically , median values were highest in April 2020 and significantly different from median viral loads in all other months , except for those observed in October and November 2020 . Similar median log - transformed viral loads were observed between May and September 2020 on the one hand and December 2020 to January 2021 on the other hand . Clearly , the Fig 3 .

The trend in proportion of strongly positive patients is very similar to the evolution in median viral load by month . The distributions of the log - transformed viral load by age ( A ) and province ( B ) are depicted in Fig 4 . The evolution of the proportion of strongly positive individuals by age and province are included in S2A and S2B Fig . The overall Kruskal - Wallis two - sided p - value to test for differences in median viral load among age groups was found to be smaller than 0 . 0001 . In general , patients in the oldest age categories ( [ 80 , 90 ) and 90 + years of age ) were found to have the highest viral loads , which were not significantly different ( p - value = 0 . 268 ) among themselves , while having pairwise BH corrected p - values all being smaller than 0 . 010 . Similar to age , significant differences in median viral load were observed across provinces ( two - sided p - value < 0 . 0001 ) overall , and between West Flanders and all other provinces , except for East Flanders ( p - value = 0 . 725 ) , based on the pairwise comparisons . The median viral loads in Limburg and Flemish Brabant were not significantly different ( p - value = 0 . 484 ) . The pairwise difference in median viral loads between Antwerp and East Flanders is borderline non - significant ( p - value = 0 . 052 ) . The final GAMs to model the SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio and the mean log - transformed viral load included a fixed effect of province , and smooth functions of age and time , with the later time evolutions being province - specific . In order to show the effect of age , time and prov - ince on the SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratios we constructed different figures . Fig 5 depicts the estimated evolution of the SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio by province over time for patients of age 54 years ( median age of all screened patients ) . Clearly , the estimated positivity ratio is high - est in West Flanders during the second wave for patients aged 54 years . In general , the peak in SARS - CoV - 2 positivity is observed to be between the beginning and mid October 2020 with some delay in West Flanders ( end of October ) , at least for this age cohort . In general , the posi - tivity ratio remains relatively high during the inter - wave period between May 2020 and Sep - tember 2020 . A similar observation is made for other age cohorts as displayed in Fig 6 . More specifically , trends in estimated positivity ratio are different between provinces , but similar between age cohorts ( except for West Flanders ) . The evolution of the positivity ratio is shown for patients of age 19 ( 10 % percentile ) , 33 ( first quartile ) , 54 ( median age ) , 69 ( third quartile ) and 80 years of age 90 % percentile ) . In general , 69 year old patients have the lowest positivity ratio during the second COVID - 19 wave . SARS - CoV - 2 positivity is high among 19 year old during the second wave which is dissimilar to the situation during the first COVID - 19 wave . Similar plots for the log - transformed viral load can be found in S3 and S4 Figs . On average , the median viral load reaches the highest levels in West Flanders . Although there is no clear temporal pattern in the mean log - transformed viral loads across all Flemish provinces , an increase is observed in median viral load between July 2020 and September 2020 , for patients of all ages , in Limburg and Flemish Brabant , prior to their increases in positivity ratio and the start of the second COVID - 19 wave in Belgium . In general , there are no substantial age differ - ences in terms of the median viral load , and the evolution thereof is very similar for each age within a province . Note that the number of data points is limited in this analysis , except in West Flanders , which is reflected in the uncertainty around the estimated mean values . Discussion Surveillance of ( the evolution of ) the fraction of asymptomatic COVID - 19 cases in healthcare settings can be an important tool to avoid and reduce nosocomial infections since a - / pre - symptomatic patients potentially have high viral loads [ 27 ] .

To our knowledge , this is the first study investigating the SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio and viral load in asymptomatic patients screened pre - hospitalization or pre - surgery . We report high positivity ratios of SARS - CoV - 2 ( overall 1 . 27 % ) amongst asymptomatic patients screened pre - hospitalization or pre - surgery in one of the nine included hospitals located in the Flemish provinces of Antwerp , East Flanders , West Flanders , Limburg and Flemish Brabant throughout the investigated period ( 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 ) . The highest peak % SARS - CoV - 2 carriership was observed during the first and second Belgian COVID - 19 wave ( i . e . , 3 . 59 % in April and 3 . 00 % in November 2020 ) [ 28 ] . The highest positiv - ity ratios were observed in West - Flanders with high case numbers observed in the beginning of 2021 which can be explained by outspoken endemic circulation of the South African 501Y . V2 SARS - CoV - 2 variant in the general population , also referred to as the beta variant or B . 1 . 351 . Lowest positivity ratios were observed in July 2020 after a period of a full lockdown , implementation of non - pharmaceutical interventions and only minor easing of containment measures ( e . g . , social distancing , increased hygiene , face - and - mouth masks , . . . ) . The evolution of the positivity ratio in our study population resembles the evolution in hospitalizations and positivity ratio in the general Flemish population . However , the SARS - CoV - 2 peak occurred Fig 5 .

Also the median viral load and proportion of strongly positive patients follow a similar temporal evolution as was seen in the positivity ratio . While a decrease in viral load is observed after the first wave , median values started to increase from 3 months before the second wave until the end of the second wave . Our results agree with the findings of Dobrovolny et al . , stating that relaxing of social distancing measures too quickly could lead to a rapid rise in the number of cases , driven in part by asymptomatic infections which remain largely undetected in the absence of large - scale testing and tracing efforts [ 29 ] . The hypothesis of underestimated viral circulation in Bel - gium based on confirmed cases only has also been put forward by Herzog et al . based on the analysis of serial serological data [ 30 ] . Young COVID - 19 patients are known to be mainly asymptomatic or pauci - symptomatic [ 7 , 31 ] . Children may act as hidden drivers of the pandemic , although schools were found not to be a high risk setting for transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 during the first and second wave of infections and several studies found that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic [ 32 , 33 ] . In Belgium , the second SARS - CoV - 2 wave started after reopening of the schools , however , we observed a real - time RT - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio of 0 . 93 % in children ( 0 – 18 year old ) and no higher SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio in children compared to adults . Our results agree with the study of Ingelbeen et al . who showed that the proportion of cases among 10 – 19 - year - olds in Brussels did not significantly change after school reopening [ 34 ] . If children were equally susceptible , one might expect even higher ratios of carriership , since they were less restricted in the number of contacts ( i . e . , due to attendance of summer camps , and given that schools were open as of 1 September 2020 onward ) . On the other hand , it is likely that a substantial part of the children requiring hospitalization or surgery during the epidemic period ( when non - urgent care was often scaled down given the high pressure of COVID - 19 on regular care ) had fewer social contacts due to serious or chronic illness . Fur - thermore , only a small number of children was included in the study . Our results show significantly higher SARS - CoV - 2 ratios in 80 + year old asymptomatic patients compared to younger patients across all time periods , except for the summer months . This may reflect the increased transmission risk in residential care homes and / or an increased transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in the non - nursing home 80 + population , especially during the first wave [ 35 ] . The lower positivity ratio in the summer months may be due to stricter mea - sures for residents of retirement homes compared to the younger population . While the posi - tivity ratio during the first wave was highest for the 80 + age group , a significantly different positivity ratio was observed for both the 80 + age group as well as the 20 – 40 age group com - pared to the other age groups during the second wave . Moreover , the highest positivity per - centage was observed in 20 – 30 year old individuals in August - September 2020 before the second COVID - 19 wave emerged ( potentially attributable to returning travelers ) , indicating that this age group has been largely affected during the second COVID - 19 wave and individu - als therein could be viewed as important drivers of that wave . In general , 69 year old patients had the lowest positivity ratio during the second COVID - 19 wave , which may be explained by the fact that they had no potential work - related exposure and no risk factor of residing in a nursing home . Some studies report no significant differences in SARS - CoV - 2 viral load in respiratory sam - ples received from different age groups [ 8 , 36 , 37 ] . In contrast , Salvatore et al . observed that SARS - CoV - 2 viral loads were significantly higher among participants under 18 years of age [ 38 ] . Children with COVID - 19 are reported to have moderate or high viral loads regardless of age , symptoms or severity of infection [ 39 ] . More specifically , children younger than 5 years PLOS ONE SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio and viral load amongasymptomatic individuals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0259908 November11 , 2021 14 / 18 with mild to moderate COVID - 19 have been reported to have high amounts of SARS - CoV - 2 viral RNA in their nasopharynx compared with older children and adults [ 40 ] . However , chil - dren with asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection had lower levels of virus in the nasopharynx / oropharynx than symptomatic children , but timing of infection relative to diagnosis likely impacted levels in asymptomatic children [ 6 ] . In our study , we observed the highest viral loads in asymptomatic 80 + year old individuals . The combination of higher SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratios and higher viral loads in this age group can be explained by frequent outbreaks seen in retirement homes [ 35 , 41 ] . The main limitation in this study includes the underrepresentation of the younger and overrepresentation of the elder age groups ( with co - morbidities requiring hospitalization or surgery ) within the study cohort . Secondly , ( weak positive ) asymptomatic cases could have corresponded to previous infections with persistent existence of detectable RNA , although this limitation does not affect the main findings of this study . Further , pre - hospitalization and pre - surgery screening policies may have been different between the participating hospitals and over time and the use of different RT - PCR platforms complicates the interpretation of viral loads . In addition , the initial RT - PCR was not repeated when testing negative and was only performed on upper respiratory tract samples , no virus genome sequencing was performed which could have yielded additional information and no information regarding the develop - ment of symptoms later on was available . Although clustering of observations within hospitals is not accounted for in the GAM models for the SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio , these models do include provincial effects ( i . e . , reflecting spatial differences in disease incidence during the course of the epidemic ) , thereby covering the spatiotemporal evolution of the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics . Consequently , the previously mentioned GAMs assume that observa - tions within individual hospitals are independent . Alternatively , one could consider a general - ized additive mixed model ( GAMM ) including hospital as a random effect , however , this did not result in a better fit to the observed data implying limited within - hospital association between observations . In general , these flexible additive models show similarly different evolu - tions of the SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ratio across Flemish provinces , induced by a different tim - ing and extent of local transmission after seeding of new SARS - CoV - 2 cases during the summer period prior to the second COVID - 19 wave in Belgium . To conclude , SARS - CoV - 2 highly circulated in all age groups ( overall 1 . 27 % ) among asymptomatic patients with strong spatiotemporal differences and a predominance and high - est viral loads observed in the elderly ( 80 + year old ) except between the first and second COVID - 19 wave . Moreover , ahead of the second COVID - 19 wave an increase in median viral load was noted with the highest overall positivity ratio observed in 20 – 30 year old individuals , indicating they could have been the hidden drivers of this wave .
