GPI - anchored surface proteins mediate many important functions , including transport , signal transduction , adhesion , and protection against comple - ment . They cluster into glycolipid - based membrane do - mains and caveolae , plasmalemmal vesicles involved in the transcytosis and endocytosis of these surface pro - teins . However , in lymphocytes , neither the characteris - tic flask shaped caveolae nor caveolin , a transmem - brane protein typical of caveolae , have been observed . Here , we show that the GPI - anchored CD59 molecule on Jurkat T cells is internalized after cross - linking , a process inhibited by nystatin , a sterol chelating agent . Clustered CD59 molecules mostly accumulate in non - coated invaginations of the lymphocyte membrane be - fore endocytosis , in marked contrast with the pattern of CD3 - TCR internalization . Cytochalasin H blocked CD59 internalization in lymphocytes , but neither CD3 internalization nor transferrin uptake . Confocal micros - copy analysis of F - actin distribution within lymphocytes showed that CD59 clusters were associated with patches of polymerized actin . Also , we found that internaliza - tion of CD59 was prevented by the protein kinase C in - hibitor staurosporine and by the protein kinase A acti - vator forskolin . Thus , in lymphocytes , as in other cell types , glycolipid - based domains provide sites of inte - gration of signaling pathways involved in GPI - anchored protein endocytosis . This process , which is regulated by both protein kinase C and A activity , is tightly controlled by the dynamic organization of actin cytoskeleton , and may be critical for polarized contacts of circulating cells . SEr of cell surface proteins is linked to the exoplas - mic leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glyco - phosphatidyl - inositol ( GPI ) 1 motif . These GPI - anchored proteins fulfill numerous functions critical for cell growth and cell - cell communication ( Low , 1989 ; Mc - Conville and Ferguson , 1993 ) . Indeed , GPI - anchored pro - teins initiate signal transduction although the mechanism remains unclear ( for reviews see Brown , 1993 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994a ) . Cross - linking of GPI - anchored molecules is re - quired for the delivery of certain activation signals ( Rob - inson , 1991 ) and has been shown to trigger their sequestra - tion into specialized glycolipid - based domains ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) on several different cell types , including on epi - thelial cells , endothelial cells ( Chang et al . , 1994 ; Lisanti et Please address all correspondence to Alain Bernard , INSERM U343 , Hrpital de l ' Archet , Route de Saint - Antoine de Ginesti ~ re , 06202 Nice cedex 3 , France .

In epithelial and endothelial ceils , these glycolipid - based domains include plasmalemmal vesicles with a characteris - tic flask - shaped morphology , also termed caveolae ( Ander - son , 1993a ) . They are composed of large detergent - insolu - ble membrane complexes , and are rich in glycosphingolipids such as GM1 gangliosides , cholesterol , and GPI - anchored proteins ( Parton , 1994a ; Ying et al . , 1992 ) . Cholesterol plays a critical role in glycolipid - based domain organization since its removing leads to unclustering of GPI - anchored proteins ( Rothberg et al . , 1990a ) . Several molecules have been identified in these detergent - insoluble complexes , in - cluding Ca 2 + pump and channel , actin and actin - binding proteins , signaling molecules such as Src - related tyrosine kinases , protein kinase C ( PKC ) , heterotrimeric and small G - proteins , and the characteristic transmembrane protein caveolin / VIP21 ( Fujimoto , 1993 ; Anderson , 1993b ; Chang et al . , 1994 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994b ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ; Sar - giacomo et al . , 1993 ) . Caveolin was originally identified as an Src tyrosine kinase substrate in transformed fibroblasts ( Glenney , 1989 ; Glenney and Soppet , 1992 ) , and it was suggested that caveolin may play a role as an adaptor for signaling mediated by GPI - anchored proteins ( Lisanti et al . , 1994a ) . Caveolae are involved in transcytosis across endothelial cells ( Milici et al . , 1987 ) , in potocytosis ( Ander - © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 96 / 05 / 791 / 9 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , Number 4 , May 1996 791 - 799 791 son et al . , 1992 ; Ying et al . , 1992 ) , and in endocytosis . They are also seen as organelles able to compartmentalize signal transduction , providing spatial and temporal information as the cell responds to environmental stimuli ( Anderson , 1993a ) . However , in lymphoid cells , characteristic caveolae have not been observed and caveolin was not detected even at the mRNA level ( Fra et al . , 1994 ) . Yet lymphocytes dis - play detergent - insoluble membrane domains of ~ 100 nM in diameter which are enriched in GSL . GPI - anchored proteins , including CD59 ( Protectin ) , CD55 ( DAF ) , and CD48 , and two Src - related protein tyrosine kinases , p56 lck and p59 fyn , were also found in these domains ( Bohuslav et al . , 1993 ; Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ; Stefanova et al . , 1991 ; Brown , 1993 ) . Since endocytosis of GPI - linked proteins in nonlym - phoid cells such as the folate receptor ( Kamen , 1989 ) , the urokinase - type plasminogen activator receptor ( Stahl and Mueller , 1995 ) , and alkaline phosphatase ( Patton et al . , 1994b ) follow caveolae - mediated endocytosis , it was of in - terest to investigate the process of GPI - anchored protein endocytosis within lymphocytes . We have chosen to inves - tigate the fate of the CD59 molecule , a GPI - linked protein involved in complement protection ( Davis et al . , 1989 ; Rollins and Sims , 1990 ; Rollins et al . , 1991 ) , T cell adhe - sion ( Groux et al . , 1989 ; Hahn et al . , 1992 ; Deckert et al . , 1992a , b ) , and T cell activation ( Korty et al . , 1991 ; Deckert et al . , 1992b , 1995 ) . We show that CD59 internalization re - quires cross - linking and integrity of glycolipid - based do - mains , since it is inhibited by a sterol chelating agent , and follows endocytosis of noncoated invaginations of the lym - phocyte membrane . In addition , we show that the internal - ization process requires a dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , and is regulated by protein kinase C and c - AMP - dependent protein kinase . Finally , we con - clude that , although caveolin and typical flask - shaped cav - eolae are not observed in lymphocytes , the features of GPI - anchored protein endocytosis and signaling in tym - phocytes follow a similar organization as in other cell types . Materials and Methods Cells and Culture A431 cells , HPB - All cells , and clones derived from the leukemic T cell line Jurkat JE6 . 1 ( wild - type ) , JR3 . T3 ( CO3neg ) , and J45 ( CD45neg ) , were obtained from the Amer . Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) . Chi - nese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells transfected with CD59 cDNA were previ - ously described ( Deckert et al . , 1992 ) . A431 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 50 U / rnl penicillin , 50 p ~ g / ml streptomycin , 2 mM L - glutamine , 1 mM pyruvate ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) , and 10 % FCS . CHO cells were cultured in Ham ' s F12 medium supplemented with 50 U / ml penicillin , 50 I ~ g / ml streptomycin , 2 mM L - glutamine , 1 mM pyru - vate , and 10 % FCS . Adherent cells were plated 24 - 48 h before experi - ments and were used at 50 - 75 % confluency . Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) supplemented with 50 U / ml penicillin , 50 I , ~ g / ml streptomycin , 2 mM L - glutamine , 1 mM pyru - vate , and 10 % FCS . Antibodies and Chemicals The CD3 X3 and CD59 H19 mAbs were produced in our laboratory . Anti - caveolin mAb was obtained from Affiniti ( Lexington , KY ) . Irrele - vant mAb , goat anti - mouse ( GAM ) , and gold - conjugated GAM Ig were obtained from Sigma Chem . Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Rabbit anti - mouse ( RAM ) Ig was obtained from Dakopatts SA ( Copenhagen , Denmark ) . CytochaIa - sin H and B , nystatin , forskolin , FITC - conjugated phalloidin , PMSF , leu - peptin , aprotinin , and NP - 40 were obtained from Sigma Chem . Co . ; stau - rosporine was obtained from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) . Chemicals for PAGE were obtained from BioRad Labs ( Richmond , CA ) . Internalization Assays Using 125I - labeled Antibodies Purified mAb were iodinated using the chloramine T ( Sigma Chem . Co . ) labeling procedure . Briefly , 50 - 200 Ixg of antibodies in 0 . 3 M H2PO4 , pH 7 . 5 , were incubated with 1 mCi 125I ( Amersham , UK ) for 45 s at 22°C in the presence of chloramine T ( 1 mg / ml ) . The reaction was stopped with sodium metabisulfite and NaI , and labeled antibodies were then filtered through a PD - 10 column ( Pharmacia ) . Specific activities of labeled mAb were routinely about 1 - 4 106 cpm / fmol . For internalization assays , ceils were incubated with 1 - 10 nM of IzSI - labeled antibodies in binding medium ( RPMI 1640 , 5 % SVF , 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 ) for 30 min on ice . After washing , cells were incubated with RAM ( 2 ~ g / ml ) for 30 min on ice , and then warmed for 60 min at 37°C . Cells were finally chilled on ice and washed two times with cold - binding medium . To distinguish between sur - face - bound and intracellular radiolabel , cells were treated twice with elu - tion medium ( 100 mM citrate , 140 mM NaCI , pH 2 . 0 ) for 5 min at 23°C . This treatment was shown to remove 95 - 98 % of the surface - bound radio - label ; nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100 - fold excess of unlabeled antibody . The fraction of internalized radiolabel was expressed as ( acid - resistant fraction of radiolabel divided by total cell - associated radiolabel ) × 100 % . Electron Microscopy Cells were incubated with the indicated mAb ( 10 - 20 ixg / ml ) followed by 10 - nm gold - conjugated anti - mouse IgG for 60 min on ice . The cells were then warmed for various time intervals at 37°C , and fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaral - dehyde in PBS for 1 h at 23°C , and then postfixed in 1 % osmium tetrox - ide . After dehydration in a series of graded ethanol baths ( 30 , 50 , 70 , 95 , and 100 % ) and propylene oxide , the cells were embedded in Epon . Cell sections ( 80 - 200 nM ) were obtained using a Reichert Ultracut E micro - tome and stained with uranyl acetate . The grids were examined using a Philips CM12 electron microscope . Conventional and Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy Ceils grown on coverslips were labeled with mAb ( 10 - 20 ~ g / ml ) for differ - ent time intervals at 4°C , washed , and treated with RAM ( 2 - 3 I ~ g / ml ) for 30 rain on ice . The cells were then warmed for the indicated times at 37°C . After washes in PBSB buffer the cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % paraformalde - hyde in PBS for 10 min at 23°C ; and either permeabilized for 30 min at 23°C in PBSB ( PBS , 1 % BSA , 0 . 1 % NAN3 ) , 0 . 05 % saponin , or left unper - meabilized . They were then incubated with FITC - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG for 30 min at 23°C . After three washes , the cells were mounted in Cit - ifluor as an anti - bleaching agent . Immunofluorescence analysis was per - formed using a Leitz microscope equipped for epifluorescence . Circulat - ing cells were allowed to settle on poly - L - lysine - coated slides ( Sigma ) for 15 rain in the dark before analysis on a Zeiss microscope equipped with a Sony video recorder . Confocal analysis was used for analysis performed on lymphoid cells . Cell suspensions treated as described above , were fi - nally centrifuged and the cell pellets were resuspended in Citifluor as an anti - bleaching agent . Cells were then allowed to settle on poly - L - lysine - coated slides ( Sigma ) for 15 rain in the dark . Fluorescence analyses were performed on a Leitz scanning confocal microscope . Internalization Assays of FITC - conjugated Ligands The uptake of FITC - conjugated transferrin ( FITC - Tf ) was performed as follows : cells were washed twice with HBS 1 % BSA , and incubated for 45 rain at 37°C in the same medium in order to deprive cells of free and bound transferrin . Cells , adjusted to 107 per ml in the above medium , were incubated with 1 p ~ M of Cyto H , and then labeled with 2 p ~ g / ml of FITC - Tf for 60 min on ice . Cells were then warmed for 30 rain at 37°C , allowing transferrin to internalize , or left at 4°C . After three washes , the cells were fixed and examined under fluorescence microscopy as described above . Measurement of F - Actin Activated Jurkat cells were washed in PBSB buffer , and then fixed for 10 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , 1996 792 min at 23°C in PBS , 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde . After two washes in PBSB , fixed cells were permeabilized for 30 min at 23°C in PBSB , 0 . 05 % saponin . The cells were then stained with FITC - phalloidin ( 1 p . g / ml ) in PBSB , 0 . 05 % saponin for 30 min at 23°C in the dark . After three extensive washes in PBSB , F - actin fluorescence was determined using a FACScan flow cytometer . The data are reported as the ratio of the mean of fluores - cence intensity of stimulated cell to control cells , or the relative fluores - cence index ( RFI ) . In some experiments , F - actin fluorescence was exam - ined using confocal microscopy as described above . Results Internalization of CD59 GPI - anchored Protein Is Induced by Cross - linking and Blocked by Nystatin We have investigated internalization of the CD59 GPI - anchored protein . Jurkat cells were labeled with either [ ~ 2sI ] CD59 or CD3 mAb at 4°C , washed , incubated again at the same temperature with anti - mouse Ig , and then warmed to 37°C for various periods of time . CD59 inter - nalization occurred only upon cross - linking with a second antibody , was detectable as soon as 30 min after the begin - ning of the cross - linking , and reached a maximum at 2 h . By contrast , CD3 internalization reached its maximum at 30 min ( Fig . 1 A ) . To determine whether CD59 internalization is dependent on cholesterol - rich membrane domains , we used the cho - lesterol binding drug , nystatin . Nystatin has been shown to selectively disrupt caveolae , but to have no effect on clath - rin - coated pits , actin cables , or other submembraneous structures ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) . For example , nystatin reduced the rate of plasmin formation by the complexes of urokinase plasminogen activator with their receptors , which localized in caveolae ( Stahl and Mueller , 1995 ) . In our pre - liminary experiments , nystatin proved to have minimal toxic effects on lymphocytes : 25 mg / ml of nystatin in se - rum - free culture medium for up to 24 h had no effect on cell morphology or viability , nor did it modify the binding of [ 125I ] CD59 mAb " H19 " to those cells ( results not shown ) . Jurkat cells were preincubated for 30 min with or without Figure 1 . Internalization of CD59 and CD3 in Jurkat cells and the effects of nystatin . Jurkat cells were labeled with [ 125I ] CD59 , ( A , open squares ) or CD3 ( A , full squares ) mAbs , washed , and then rabbit anti - mouse Ab was added for different times . [ 12sI ] - mAb internalization was measured as described in Materials and Meth - ods . Results are expressed as the percentage of CD3 or CD59 in - ternalization . In B , cells in serum - free medium were preincu - bated for 30 min at 37°C with nystatin ( 25 Ixg / ml ) or not , and then were labeled with [ 1251 ] CD59 or CD3 mAb followed by second - ary antibody for 2 h at 37°C . Results are expressed as the percent - age of variation relative to control ceils ( 3 , 500 cpm and 12 , 500 cpm , respectively , for CD59 and CD3 ) . nystatin , and then labeled with either [ 125I ] CD59 or CD3 mAbs before cross - linking . Under these conditions , CD59 internalization was decreased up to 30 % in the presence of nystatin ( Fig . 1 B ) . In contrast , T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) downmodulation was unaffected by nystatin ( Fig . 1 B ) . These data suggest that in lymphoid cells , GPI - anchored proteins are clustered upon cross - linking in sterol - enriched domains of the plasma membrane , and these domains are required for internalization of the receptor . Internalization of CD59 GPI - anchored Protein Occurs Preferentially in Uncoated Vesicles The fate of CD59 following antibody - induced cross - linking on the lymphocytic T cell line Jurkat was next examined by electron microscopy . Cells were labeled with CD59 mAb followed by incubation with colloidal gold - labeled anti - mouse IgG at 4°C or for various times at 37°C . Cells incu - bated at 4°C showed uniform distribution of CD59 on the plasma membrane , and only 10 % of the total particles were clustered at the cell surface ( Fig . 2 and Table I ) . Upon warming at 37°C , gold particles associated with CD59 were clustered ( up to 45 % of the particles observed on the plasma membrane ) . After 15 rain at 37°C , they were de - tectable within the cells ( Table I ) , and in large endocytic vesicles ( 1 - 10 particles per vesicle ) associated with inter - nal material ( Fig . 2 ) . Quantitation indicated that after 60 min of cross - linking at 37°C , 33 % of the gold particles were internalized ( Table I ) , and could be seen associated with large endocytic vesicles and multivesicular bodies ( Fig . 2 ) . Notably , gold particles associated with CD59 were seen most often in noncoated invaginations of the plasma membrane . After 15 rain of cross - linking at 37°C , quantita - tive determination showed that up to 6 % of particles were found in coated vesicles , whereas 30 % were found in non - coated invaginations ( Fig . 2 and Table I ) . Thus , these re - sults show that upon clustering , CD59 preferentially accu - mulates in noncoated structures . A Role for Protein Kinases in GPI - anchored Protein Internalization within Lymphoid Cells Since cytoplasmic kinases have been found to be involved in caveolae internalization ( Smart et al . , 1995 ) , we exam - ined the effects of pharmaceutical agents on the endocytic pathway of GPI - anchored proteins . Confocal analysis showed that staurosporine , a PKC inhibitor , and forskolin , an activator of protein kinase A ( PKA ) , abrogated the in - ternalization of CD59 ( Fig . 3 ) . Of note , no significant al - teration of the clustering of CD59 was observed ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) , indicating that kinase inhibition acts on the inter - nalization process of GPI - anchored proteins rather than on a prerequisite phase of cross - linking . Other PKC inhib - itors , namely calphostine C and sphingosine , also inhibited CD59 internalization at concentrations consistent with PKC inhibition , whereas herbimycin A , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , did not inhibit CD59 internalization ( not shown ) . By contrast , forskolin almost completely inhibited CD59 but not CD3 downmodulation ( Fig . 4 ) . This indicates that cAMP - dependent serine / threonine kinases are involved in regulating internalization of GPI - anchored proteins within lymphoid cells . Deckert et al .

Disruption of Actin Filaments Inhibits Internalization of GPI - anchored Proteins in Lymphocytes The integrity of the actin cytoskeleton can be required for endocytosis , depending on the cell type , and , most likely , on the mechanism of endocytosis ( Anderson , 1991 ) . We therefore examined , within lymphocytes , the influence of the actin cytoskeleton on the endocytosis of GPI - anchored proteins and proteins requiring a clathrin - dependent mech - anism of endocytosis . First , we measured endocytosis with 125I - labeled mAb . When cells were incubated with Cyto H , the internalization of [ 125 [ ] CD59 mAb was abrogated , whereas [ 1251 ] CD3 mAb was internalized to the same extent as in the controls ( Fig . 5 ) . Scanning confocal microscopy performed on sa - ponin - permeabilized cells showed that time - dependent in - ternalization of CD59 was completely abolished by 1 p ~ M of Cyto H . Importantly , it should be noted that Cyto H neither inhibited the initial patching nor the capping of CD59 , suggesting that the inhibition of GPI - anchored protein in - ternalization cannot be accounted for by the inhibition of their clustering . By contrast neither CD3 / TCR internaliza - tion ( results not shown ) nor Tf - FITC uptake by Jurkat cells ( Fig . 6 ) was affected . We next examined CD59 internalization by electron mi - croscopy . Upon Cyto H treatment , cells exhibited a patched distribution of gold particles on the plasma membrane ( 2 - 10 particles per patch ) ( Fig . 7 ) . Although the amount of clustered CD59 - associated gold particles were identical in untreated or Cyto H - treated cells , only 4 % of the particles were found within Cyto H - treated cells , even after 60 min of clustering at 37°C ( Table I , Fig . 7 , A - D ) . By contrast , the internalization of gold particles associated with the CD3 complex was not inhibited by Cyto H treatment , and particles ( 3 - 12 per vesicle ) were still detectable in multive - sicular structures ( Fig . 7 E ) . Thus , in lymphocytes , struc - tural integrity of actin filaments is required for the inter - nalization pathway mediated by glycolipid - based domains . Reorganization of the Actin Cytoskeleton and CD59 Clustering Given the effects of Cyto H on CD59 internalization , we examined the organization of the actin cytoskeleton fol - lowing CD59 cross - linking . CD59 was cross - linked for dif - ferent times at 37°C , cells were fixed , and then permeabilized with saponin . Incubation with FITC - conjugated phalloidin allowed detection of the cellular content of F - actin ; quan - tification was performed by FACS analysis . CD59 cross - linking induced a transient augmentation of F - actin ( 1 . 4 - fold augmentation of RFI at 10 rain ) , peaking at 15 min , and decreasing after 30 rain ( Fig . 8 A ) . This process was abol - ished by incubating the cells with i jxM Cyto H ( Fig . 8 A ) . Scanning confocal microscopy showed that CD59 cross - linking increased the level of F - actin , but also induced the formation of actin patches ( Fig . 8 B , panel b ) . Cross - link - ing of CD59 mAb with a TRITC - labeled GAM IgG for 10 min at 37°C , followed by FITC - conjugated phalloidin and confocal analysis , showed that F - actin closely localized with the CD59 clusters at the cell surface ( Fig . 9 ) . Discussion In this report , we have investigated the endocytosis of CD59 , a typical GPI - anchored protein from human lym - phocytes ( Deekert et al . , 1992 , 1995 ) . We show that it first requires clustering within glycolipid - based membrane do - mains in a sterol - dependent manner . Next , a dynamic re - organization of the actin cytoskeleton is required . In addi - tion , we show that the signaling pathway leading to endocytosis is controlled both by PKC and PKA activity . It appears quite distinct from the signaling pathway initi - ated through CD59 cross - linking on lymphocytes , which requires protein tyrosine kinase activities .

A cluster of gold paricles was defined as three or more associated gold particles . ' 250 - 300 individual gold particles were counted for each condition , representing 20 - 40 cells sections ( representative of two different experiments ) . In lymphoid cells , caveolae and caveolin are not detect - able ( Fra et al . , 1994 ; Gorodinsky et al , 1995 ) . Instead , lymphocytes display large , glycolipid - based domains where GPI - anchored proteins are found ( Stefanova et al . , 1991 ; Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ) . Recently , Parton and Simons proposed the term of detergent - insoluble glycosphin - golipid - enriched complexes to distinguish such regions from classical morphological entity termed caveolae ( Par - ton and Simons , 1995 ) . However , in the absence of caveo - lae in lymphocytes , the endocytic process of GPI - anchored proteins remains unclear . We observed under electron mi - croscopy analysis that the internalization of CD59 on tym - phocytes involves an initial step of accumulation in un - coated membrane invaginations . After clustering , CD59 proteins undergo internalization via uncoated pits and vesicles of ~ 60 - 100 nm in diameter . Most of the CD59 - labeled material was found within such uncoated vesicles near the membrane , although a small proportion was also seen in coated pits . Our observations are consistent with the biochemical studies from Horejsi and colleagues about the dimension of the detergent - insoluble GPI - domains in immune cells , including lymphocytes ( Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ; Bohuslav et al . , 1993 ) and monocytes ( Bohuslav et al . , 1995 ) . In studies performed on nonlymphoid cells , it was shown that these domains are disrupted in cells de - pleted of cholesterol , or treated with sterol - binding drugs such as nystatin or filipin , leading to unclustering of GPI - anchored proteins ( Rothberg et al . , 1990a , 1992 ) . We found here that , in lymphoid cells , nystatin inhibits the an - tibody - induced internalization of CD59 while the clathrin - Figure 3 .

Taken together , our data also suggest that CD59 is not in - ternalized through the clathrin - coated pit pathway . In this respect , a GPI - anchored form of CD4 was shown to be preferentially internalized through uncoated vesicles on transfected CHO cells ( Keller et al . , 1992 ) . Similar obser - vations were reported about other GPI - anchored pro - teins such as the folate receptor ( Rothberg et al . , 1990b ) and Thy - 1 glycoprotein ( Bamezai et al . , 1992 ) . Thus , it ap - pears that the glycolipid - based domains from lymphoid cells are also involved in the formation of endocytic vesi - cles , as it has been reported for glycolipid - based domains 50 CD59 CD3 " 40 O N = 30 E c 20 O 10 0 " 1 " ii / ° 37oc - + + - + + Cyto H " = + " = + Figure 5 .

Finally , we used in our experiments two antibodies in order to cross - link CD59 , a phenomenon which in gen - eral is considered to induce an artifactual organization of the plasma membrane molecules . However , it might be important to note that since CD59 is constitutively clus - tered on the cell surface ( Van den Berg et al . , 1995 ) , add - ing two antibodies may rather stabilize the native distribu - tion of CD59 on cell membrane . One important question is how mechanisms control the endocytic pathway of GPI - anchored proteins . We found that actin reorganization was a subsequent critical step , since we observed that Cyto H inhibited CD59 internaliza - tion , and that patches of polymerized actin colocalized with CD59 clusters before internalization . In addition , we found that Cyto H blocked the internalization of GM1 GSL ( data not shown ) , which are enriched in caveolae ( Parton et al . , 1994a ) . The actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be involved in intracellular trafficking ( Anderson , 1991 ) , but its role in internalization remains unclear . In mammalian cells , cytochalasin D reduces uptake via a nonclathrin - dependent pathway ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 1990 ) , while apical uptake from polarized epithelial cells is also reduced by depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ) . Furthermore , cytochalasin D inhibits okadaic acid - induced wash - out of caveolae from epithelial cell membranes ( Par - ton et al . , 1994b ) . However , we observed no effect ( or weak effects ) of Cyto H on the antibody - induced internal - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , 1996 796 Figure 7 .

Although we could not exclude the attach - ment of these cells that might stabilize the actin cytoskele - ton , these results also suggest that glycolipid - based domains from different cell types may be subjected to different mo - lecular regulation . Based on our observations , we conclude that glycolipid - based domains in lymphocytes interact with the actin cytoskeleton . One possibility is that actin assembly participates in the early step of invagination , which is presumably followed by fusion with endosomal structures . In this regard , corti - cal actin patches were recently found associated with in - vaginations of the yeast plasma membrane ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) . Furthermore the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be involved in receptor - mediated endocytosis in yeast ( Ktibler and Riezman , 1993 ) . Thus , the budding of GPI - domains in lymphocytes may be controlled by corti - cal actin cytoskeleton . Caveolae from epithelial and en - Figure 8 .

M for 30 min at 37°C , and then labeled or not with CD59 mAb followed by secondary antibody for 0 - 30 rain at 37°C . At the indicated times , cells were fixed , permeabil - ized in 0 . 05 % saponin , and labeled with FITC - phalloidin . F - actin content was determined either by FACS analysis ( A ) or by confo - cal analysis ( B ) . The data are expressed as the relative fluores - cence index ( RFI ) , relative to control ceils , and represents the mean of triplicate determinations - SD ( A ) . B shows representa - tive confocal images of inactivated cells ( a ) and cells activated by CD59 mAb for 15 min ( b ) or 30 min ( c ) while d represents cells incubated in the presence of Cyto H at 1 IxM before activation by CD59 mAb for 15 min . dothelial cells have been found to be enriched in actin and actin - binding protein , heterotrimeric G - proteins , and small G - proteins from the Rab and Rap families ( Chang et al . , 1994 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994b ) . There is compelling evidence that both heterotrimeric and small G proteins regulate as - sembly / deassembly of actin filaments ( Shefcyk et al . , 1985 ; Hall , 1994 ) . Thus , although they are not fully character - ized , the lymphocyte glycolipid - based domains provide likely sites for initiation of actin nucleation and assembly . Proteins involved in regulating cytoskeletal organization or in the formation of endocytic vesicles are likely targets Deckert et al . Endocytosis of GPl - anchored Proteins 797 Figure 9 .

The finding that Src - related tyrosine kinases and GPI - anchored proteins are complexed within glycolipid - based domains is therefore of critical importance , since antibodies against these GPI - anchored proteins have been shown to trigger signals within different cell types ( Brown , 1993 ) . Indeed , we recently found that cross - linking of CD59 triggers acti - vation of the associated p561ck kinase and stimulates both CD3 / TCR - dependent and - independent signaling path - ways in T cells ( Deckert et al . , 1995 ) . Serine and threonine kinases are also critical for cell signaling , and stimulation of protein kinase C activity by phorbol esters has been shown to inhibit folate receptor internalization in MA104 epithelial cells ( Smart et al . , 1994 ) . In addition , a popula - tion of PKCot molecules were found to reside in the caveo - lar membrane , whose activity is required for caveolae in - vagination ( Smart et al . , 1995 ) . In the present study we found that staurosporine , a PKC inhibitor , prevented CD59 internalization within human lymphoid cells . In Jur - kat variants deficient in TCR / CD3 or CD45 expression , we have observed that CD59 was still internalized ( not shown ) . This establishes that the TCR / CD3 complex and the tyrosine phosphatase CD45 do not transduce biochem - ical signals required for internalization of GPI - anchored molecules , although these signals are critical for T cell acti - vation ( Weiss and Littman , 1994 ) . Moreover , activation of p561ck induced by cross - linking CD59 ( Deckert et al . , 1995 ) was unaffected by actin filament depolymerization ( data not shown ) . It is tempting to propose that internal - ization is a negative regulatory mechanism of activation signals , which would have an important role during cell ac - tivation . In conclusion , our data provide clues about the functions of glycolipid - based domains and the molecular mechanisms underlying their organization . Keeping in mind that lym - phocytes are unpolarized cells in a resting state , but be - come polarized upon cell - cell or cell - matrix interaction , such domains may provide critical spatial information and sites of integration for signaling pathways . Since many GPI - anchored molecules are involved in cell adhesion and in signal transduction , endocytosis of GPI - anchored mole - cules is a likely means for reversible adhesion and for fine tuning of cell signaling .
