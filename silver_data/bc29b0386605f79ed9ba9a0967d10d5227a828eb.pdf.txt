It is related to various effects : ( 1 ) cell - bulk surface effects ( cell – polymer mechanical interactions ) and cell surface – polymer surface effects ( cell – polymer electrostatic interactions ) at the bio - interface , ( 2 ) polymer – bulk volume effects ( polymer – polymer mechanical and electrostatic interactions ) within the perturbed boundary layers around the cell aggregates , ( 3 ) cumulative surface and volume effects within the parts of the microbead , and ( 4 ) macroscopic effects within the microbead as a whole based on multi scale modeling approaches . All modeling levels are discussed at two time scales i . e . long time scale ( cell growth time ) and short time scale ( cell rearrangement time ) . Matrix structural changes results in the resistance stress generation which have the feedback impact on : ( 1 ) single and collective cell migrations , ( 2 ) cell deformation and ori - entation , ( 3 ) decrease of cell - to - cell separation distances , and ( 4 ) cell growth . Herein , an attempt is made to discuss and connect various multi scale modeling approaches on a range of time and space scales which have been proposed in the literature in order to shed further light to this complex course - consequence phenomenon which induces the anomalous nature of energy dissipation during the structural changes of cell aggregates and matrix quantiﬁed by the damping coefﬁcients ( the orders of the fractional derivatives ) . Deeper insight into the matrix partial disintegration within the boundary layers is useful for understand - ing and minimizing the polymer matrix resistance stress generation within the interface and on that base optimizing cell growth . © 2015 Elsevier B .

Introduction Ca - alginate hydrogel - immobilized cell systems in the form of microbeads are attractive for a variety of applications in biotech - nology and biomedicine . Signiﬁcant attempts have been made to optimize performances of such beads by assuring appropriate con - ditions for their biotechnological functions [ 1 – 5 ] . These functions depend on efﬁcient supply of cells by nutrients and oxygen , optimal micro - environmental conditions for cells inside the bead , decrease of cell leakage from the bead , etc . Some nutrient components such as : phosphate buffer , NaCl , K 2 HPO 4 etc . can chemically disinte - grate the Ca - alginate network and induce its irreversible swelling . Levic et al . [ 6 ] researched the irreversible structural changes and swelling of 2 % Ca - alginate beads in phosphate buffer . Irreversible swelling is more intensive than reversible swelling in water . Plavsic et al . [ 7 ] considered catalytic degradation processes and swelling of Ca - alginate network under inﬂuence of oxygen . Oxygen in the presence of reducing agents as ascorbic acid forms peroxide . Per - oxide decomposition under catalytic action of transition metals leads to formation of radicals that attach polymer chains . How - ever , some other components such as higher alcohols or organic acids also react with free radicals and can slow down the degra - dation process . Chemically induced Ca - alginate disintegration is faster than cell growth process . It usually inﬂuences the initial stage of cell cultivation process while mechanically and electrostat - ically induced Ca - alginate disintegration caused by cell expansion becomes dominant in the further stage of cell growth . Cell action connected with mechanical and electrostatic cell - polymer interac - tions is of special interest here . Cell aggregates expansion causes generation of the matrix resistance stress within the boundary lay - ers around the aggregates . This stress has the feedback restrictive action to cell growth . Regulation of the stress generation offers the possibility to optimize the whole process . Simpson et al . [ 8 ] reported that expansion of immobilized cell population induces the irreversible structural changes of Ca - alginate network . They consider the growth of (cid:2) TC3 cells within the Ca - alginate matrix with and without washing with CaCl 2 . The washing treatment causes reconnection of disintegrated parts of the ionic network . Micro - environmental growth restriction is more signiﬁcant for the washing case . However , Pajic - Lijakovic et al . [ 9 , 10 ] obtained sig - niﬁcant suppression of yeast cell growth within the Ca - alginate matrix in experiments without washing with CaCl 2 . Irreversible structural change of the Ca - alginate network is dominant in this case . Cells are able to partially disintegrate the network within the boundary layers around the cell aggregates and ﬁnd new space for growth . However , they ﬁll only 20 % of Ca - alginate microbead volume . A deeper insight into the bio - interface dynamics is nec - essary for understanding the dynamics of micro environmentally restricted cell growth . Reversible and irreversible matrix structural changes include : ( 1 ) alginate chains conformational changes which inﬂuence inter and intra chain interactions [ 11 , 12 ] , ( 2 ) disruption of egg box junction zones made by Ca 2 + ions and alginate chains [ 9 ] . Firstly , we will discuss the main characteristics of alginate chains relevant for the matrix rheological behavior and further indicate appropriate space and time scales for modeling considerations . Alginate is a strong polyelectrolyte . The chain stiffness could be quantiﬁed by the ratio l p / L C ( where l p is the persistence length and L C is the chain contour length ) . If l p / L C ∼ 1 , the chains are semi ﬂex - ible . The persistence length of alginate chains is equal to l p = l i + l e ( where l i is the intrinsic contribution due to chemical structure of the chains and l e is the electrostatic contribution due to poly - electrolyte nature of the chains ) . Dias Banosa et al . [ 12 ] reported that the intrinsic contribution is l i ≈ 11 . 3nm while the electrostatic contribution decreases with ionic strength increase from I e = 6 nm obtained at 0 . 01 ionic strength to I e = 1 . 7 nm obtained at 0 . 2 ionic strength . The average chain end - to - end distance within the network ( i . e . the mesh size ) is 11 – 20 nm [ 13 ] . Electrostatic interac - tions among : ( 1 ) chain parts , ( 2 ) chains themselves and ( 3 ) chains and near cell membranes , signiﬁcantly contribute to Ca - alginate structural ordering . Consequently , the alginate chains could be treated as semi ﬂexible . Haverkamp et al . [ 14 ] treated them as worm like chains ( WLC ) [ 15 ] while Josef et al . [ 11 ] reported that semi ﬂexible chain approach ( which accounts for excluded volume effects ) could be more suitable for describing the alginate chains conformational changes . Cell expansion induces compression of the matrix boundary layers around the immobilized aggregates . Matrix compression intensiﬁes short range interactions between the parts of single alginate chains and long range interactions between alginate chains themselves [ 12 ] . The chains structural ordering represents the result of two opposite tendencies . Short range interactions lead to chains “apparent shortening” quantiﬁed by the intrinsic viscosity decrease [ 12 ] . On the other hand , long range interactions , pronounced during matrix compression , induce intensive chains folding conformations which cause the intrinsic viscosity increase . The intrinsic viscosity accounts for cumulative effects of inter and intra chains interactions intensity . Mechanical properties of Ca - alginate hydrogel quantiﬁed through the values of Young’s modulus , compression modulus and shear modulus are highly dependent on the choice of the algi - nate polymer and how it was processed [ 16 , 17 ] . High guluronic acid containing alginate polymers yielded stronger , more ductile hydrogels than high mannuronic acid containing alginates . The properties of Ca - alginate hydrogel also depend on the cross - linker , the gelling environment and storage environment . The Young’s modulus ranges from 1 to 10 kPa , the compression modulus ranges from less than 1 kPa to greater than 1000 kPa , while the shear mod - ulus has values in the range of 0 . 02 to 40 kPa [ 16 , 17 ] . Ca - alginate network represents the dense structure with the effective pore size between 11 to 20 nm [ 13 ] . It is much less than the averaged diameter of the cell . Ca - alginate structural changes should be con - sidered in the context of loading conditions during cell aggregates expansion . The loading conditions depend on short and long time cell rearrangement and growth , as well as the mechanical behavior of single cells . The cell rearrangement includes interplay between the processes of : ( 1 ) single and collective cell migrations , ( 2 ) cell deformation and orientation , ( 3 ) decrease of cell - to - cell separa - tion distances and ( 4 ) cell growth . It has been considered on two time scales : a short time scale ( i . e . the rearrangement time ) and a long time scale ( i . e . the cell growth time ) [ 18 ] . The values of Young’s modulus for various cell types are different in many orders of magnitude . Young’s modulus for muscle cells is E c = 10 − 45 kPa while ﬁbroblasts are more elastic with Young’s modulus equal to E c = 4 − 5 kPa [ 19 ] . The Young’s modulus of yeast cells is equal to E c = 112 ± 6 MPa for cells in exponential phase and E c = 107 ± 6 MPa for cells in stationary phase [ 20 ] . Matrix structural changes caused by immobilized cell aggregate expansion include the following steps : ( 1 ) immobilized aggregates induce radial deformations of surrounding hydrogel matrix dur - ing the aggregates expansion [ 25 ] , ( 2 ) radial deformations induce generation of the matrix resistance stress around the aggregates [ 9 , 25 , 26 ] , ( 3 ) generated resistance matrix stress induces feedback generation of the internal stress within the cell aggregates [ 18 , 26 ] and ( 5 ) the internal stress provokes a biological response of cells [ 8 , 9 ] . Immobilized cell aggregate rearrangement and growth is driven by the internal cell stress generated within the aggregate . The internal stress represents a consequence of the matrix rhe - ological response to cell expansion . These cell actions result in the matrix structural changes and provoke a complex rheological response . The response includes both the reversible deformation of the matrix domains , as well as partially disintegration of the domains which causes permanent irreversible deformation [ 10 ] . 238 I . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . / Colloids and Surfaces B : Biointerfaces 132 ( 2015 ) 236 – 245 This complex process is inﬂuenced by various multi scale interac - tions , i . e . interactions between domains themselves as well as those between chains within the domains . An interesting question regarding the process optimization is how immobilized cells inﬂuence rheological behavior of the microbeads in the context of the matrix irreversible structural changes . We consider structural changes of Ca - alginate net - work caused by : ( 1 ) cell addition during microbead preparation ( instantaneous structural changes ) and ( 2 ) cell growth ( long time structural changes ) . Cell addition could induce the hydro - gel reinforcement or weakening . Various experimental works have shown quite different results . Junter and Vinet [ 21 ] reported that immobilized yeast cells induce Ca - alginate hydrogel weakening instantaneously after addition during the microbead preparation . The weakening phenomenon is caused by electrostatic interactions between free parts of polyelectrolyte chains such as alginate and negatively charged cell membranes . Rokstad at al . [ 22 ] reported that zeta potential of Ca - alginate matrix is about - 10 V comparable to the value of cell membranes which induces electrostatic repul - sions . However , Jovanovic - Milinovska et al . [ 23 ] reported that yeast addition induces the hydrogel reinforcement . Experimental data presented in literature points that both softer and stiffer cells cause the hydrogel weakening during cell growth time period ( long - time changes ) resulting in the irreversible struc - tural changes . Hunt et al . [ 24 ] considered ﬁbroblasts growth within Ca - alginate hydrogel . They observed intensive partial disintegra - tion of the hydrogel during initial growth phase for up to 7 days . Hydrogel retained sufﬁcient mechanical integrity during the cul - tivation time period for up to 28 days . Irreversible changes of Ca - alginate hydrogel is intensiﬁed by mechanical cell - matrix inter - actions and electrostatic interactions between the free parts of polyelectrolyte chains such as alginate and negatively charged cell membranes [ 9 , 10 , 21 ] . On the other hand , the attractive forces of the network segments tend to keep the structural integrity and could cause damping effects to energy dissipation [ 10 ] . For this purpose , matrix structural changes caused by immobilized cell rearrangement and growth will be consid - ered theoretically based on thermodynamical and rheological approaches : ( 1 ) at cell - polymer interface , ( 2 ) within boundary lay - ers around the immobilized cell aggregates , ( 3 ) within microbead parts and ( 4 ) within the microbead as a whole . It is relatively hard to provide more detailed information of this multilevel process caused by cell action on the molecular level of polymer network . How - ever , its energetic effects can be considered in terms of modern thermodynamics and rheology . 2 . Modeling considerations 2 . 1 . System phenomenological description Matrix structural changes within the boundary layers around immobilized cell aggregates depend on aggregate state changes . Dynamics of the aggregate state changes occurs through many relaxation cycles during the cell growth time (cid:2) . Duration of the sin - gle relaxation cycle is t ∈ [ 0 , t eq ] where t is the cell rearrangement time such that t ≺≺ (cid:2) . Every relaxation cycle of the aggregate is caused by a steep increase of the local cell number (cid:3) N ( r , (cid:2) ) in the aggregate parts ( where r is the radial coordinate from the aggre - gate center ) . Aggregate is supposed to be nearly spherical with the volume V C ( t , (cid:2) ) = 4 / 3 (cid:4) (cid:7) c ( t eq , (cid:2) ) 3 ( where (cid:7) c ( t eq , (cid:2) ) is the ensemble averaged aggregate radius ) . During cell growth and rearrangement , the aggregate expands and induces compression of the surround - ing matrix within the boundary layer with the volume V mB ( t , (cid:2) ) = 4 / 3 (cid:4) [ (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) 3 − (cid:7) c ( t , (cid:2) ) 3 ] ( where (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) is the radius of the matrix boundary layer around the cell aggregate ) . For (cid:7) = (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) the hydrogel structure is unperturbed at time set ( t , (cid:2) ) . Schematic representation of the considered system at nanometer , mesoscopic and macroscopic scales is shown in Fig . 1 . The considered system consists of two sub - systems : ( 1 ) the aggregate and ( 2 ) the matrix boundary layer in multi scale inter - actions . The cell - polymer interface is located at (cid:7) i ( t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:7) c ( t , (cid:2) ) . Number of aggregates N aggregates within the microbead is supposed to be constant during the cell growth time period while the num - ber of cells per aggregate N ( (cid:2) ) increases during growth time based on our experimental observation [ 9 , 10 ] . The simultaneous matrix and cell aggregate relaxation cycles during the growth time period include rearrangement of both sub - systems . Ca - alginate structural changes are induced by mechanical and electrostatic interactions . Various surface and volume effects related to cell - cell , cell - polymer and polymer - polymer mechanical and electrostatic interactions inﬂuence the structural changes of cell and matrix subsystems at various time and space scales . It is presented in Table 1 . 2 . 1 . 1 . Dynamics of cell - polymer interface At the end of single relaxation cycles , the matrix and the cell stresses are equilibrated at the interface ( Fig . 1 ) [ 27 ] . The equilib - rium at mesoscopic level is expressed through two conditions : ˜ (cid:5) cT ( (cid:7) i , t eq , (cid:2) ) = ˜ (cid:5) m ( (cid:7) i , t eq , (cid:2) ) ( 1a ) (cid:7) c ( t eq , (cid:2) ) (cid:2) 0 ˜ (cid:5) cT ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) 4 r 2 (cid:4) dr = (cid:7) m ( t eq , (cid:2) ) (cid:2) (cid:7) c ( t eq , (cid:2) ) ˜ (cid:5) m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) 4 r 2 (cid:4) dr ( 1b ) where ˜ (cid:5) cT ( (cid:7) i , t eq , (cid:2) ) is the cell stress at the interface , ˜ (cid:5) m ( (cid:7) i , t eq , (cid:2) ) is the resistance matrix stress at the interface , ˜ (cid:5) cT ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) is the cell stress within the aggregate and ˜ (cid:5) m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) is the matrix stress within the boundary layer . The ﬁrst condition corresponds to the interface , while the second corresponds to the whole cell aggre - gate and matrix boundary layer . Cheng et al . [ 26 ] reported that maximum cell stress is generated within the aggregate center and decreases up to r = (cid:7) i . On the other hand , the maximum matrix stress is obtained at the interface and decreases up to r = (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) . The second condition determines the matrix boundary layer thickness depending on : ( 1 ) cell stress and ( 2 ) matrix rheological behavior . The matrix stress is equal to : ˜ (cid:5) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = ˜ (cid:5) mE ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + ˜ (cid:5) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ( 2 ) where ˜ (cid:5) mE ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is the elastic , reversible part and ˜ (cid:5) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is the viscous , irreversible part of the matrix stress . Electrostatic repulsive interactions among cell membranes and alginate network could cause the matrix partial disintegration even in the initial phase of cell growth which leads to matrix weakening [ 9 , 10 , 21 , 24 ] . The phenomenon is pronounced at the interface . Consequently , the irreversible part of the matrix stress could be much higher than the reversible part of stress , i . e . ˜ (cid:5) mV ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) (cid:8)(cid:8) ˜ (cid:5) mE ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) . Murray et al . [ 27 ] reported that the cell internal stress at the interface ˜ (cid:5) cT ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) depends on both the cell packing density and the density of the extra - cellular matrix in the boundary layer around the aggregate . They formulated the expression for the com - ponent of the internal stress at the interface as : (cid:5) c T ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = k 1 n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) k 2 + k 3 n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) 2 ( (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) + (cid:7) ∇ 2 (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ) ( 3 ) where n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the local packing density of cells at the inter - face , k 1 k 2 , k 3 are the constitutive parameters which depend on cell type , (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the local mass density of the extra - cellular matrix and (cid:7) is the constitutive parameter of the matrix . The cor - responding cell packing density at the interface n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is equal to n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) j ı ( (cid:7) i − r j ( t , (cid:2) ) ) ( where r j is the radius vector of j - th cell ) . The cell packing density changes at the interface by cell I . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . / Colloids and Surfaces B : Biointerfaces 132 ( 2015 ) 236 – 245 239 Fig . 1 . Cell and matrix sub - systems within the Ca - alginate microbead at various space scales – schematic representation . migration , deformation , orientation and growth . These changes include : ( 1 ) cell bulk surface effects related to cell - polymer mechanical interactions and ( 2 ) cell surface - polymer surface effects related to cell - polymer electrostatic interactions [ 10 ] . Conse - quently , we hypothesize that the short - time cell packing density changes by convective , mechanotaxis and electrotaxis ﬂuxes are dominant at the interface while conductive ﬂux included by Mur - ray et al . [ 27 ] is dominant within the cell aggregate . Cell - polymer mechanical interactions are accounted for by the mechanotaxis ﬂux while cell - matrix electrostatic interactions signiﬁcant for ionic hydrogel matrix such as Ca - alginate are accounted for by the electrotaxis ﬂux . Short time cell convective ﬂux is expressed as : J cellC ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) v c ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) j v cj ı ( (cid:7) i − r j ( t , (cid:2) ) ) ( 4 ) where v cj is the radial velocity of j th cell at the interface and v c ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the averaged rate of changes the cell displacement ﬁeld . The velocity depends on cell type and the nature of cell migra - tion . For the adherent cells , the migration depends on the stability of adhesion complex [ 28 ] . Migration of non - adherent cells through the aggregates corresponds to the sliding [ 29 ] or to the amoeboid migration [ 30 ] . These mechanisms include cell deformation and passing through narrow channels between neighboring cells and surrounding matrix parts . Upadhyaya et al . [ 31 ] and Dieterich et al . [ 32 ] have pointed to the anomalous nature of the cell migration . It represents the consequence of various bio - mechanical intracellular processes which cause delaying effects . Cell velocity changes have been described by the fractional Langevin equation [ 32 ] . The radial velocity could be expressed by the fractional derivatives [ 33 ] as : v c j = C 0 D (cid:8) t ( (cid:3)r j ) ( 5 ) where (cid:3) r j is the radial displacement of j th cell and C 0 D (cid:8)t ( • ) = d (cid:8) dt (cid:8) ( • ) is the Caputo’s fractional derivative , while (cid:8) is the order of the fractional derivatives for the short time cell rearrangement at mesoscopic level such that (cid:8) ≺ 1 . Higher value of the damping coef - ﬁcient indicates more intensive energy dissipation . It corresponds to the damping effects of the short - time cell rearrangement . The main cause of the damping effect is connected with the anoma - lous nature of cell migration . Caputo’s deﬁnition of the fractional derivative of some function f ( t ) was used and it is given as follows [ 33 ] : C 0 D (cid:8)t ( f ( t ) ) = 1 (cid:9) ( 1 − (cid:8) ) d dt t (cid:2) 0 f ( t (cid:10) ) ( 1 ) ( t − t (cid:10) ) (cid:8) dt (cid:10) ( 6 ) where t is an independent variable ( time ) , (cid:8) is the order of the fractional derivative , (cid:9) ( 1 − (cid:8) ) is the gamma function . If the param - eter (cid:6) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is (cid:8) = 0 , we obtain C 0 D 0 t ( f ( t ) ) = f ( t ) . When (cid:8) = 1 , the corresponding gamma function (cid:9) ( 1 − (cid:8) ) → ∞ . For this case , the fractional derivative is not deﬁned . However , it can be shown , that in the limit when (cid:8) → 1 , follows C 0 D 1 t ( f ( t ) ) → df ( t ) / dt . Then , the averaged rate of changes in the cell displacement ﬁeld at the inter - face is equal to : v c ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS ( u c ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ) t ( where u c ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the average cell displacement ﬁeld at the interface , and (cid:8) mesoS is the damping coefﬁcient for the short time cell structural changes ) . The short - time cell packing density changes at the interface has to include anomalous nature of energy dissipation generated dur - ing cell radial displacement to matrix and expressed by modiﬁed Murray expression [ 27 ] as : C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t ( n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ) ≈ ∇ [ J cellC ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) + J h ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) + J el ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ] ( 7 ) where J h ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the local mechanotaxis ﬂux equal to J h ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = a n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ∇ (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) , a is the measure of cell - matrix mechanical interactions , J el ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the local electrotaxis ﬂux equal to J el ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = g C n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ∇ (cid:10) ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) , g C is the measure of cell - matrix electrostatic interactions , and (cid:10) ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the local electrostatic potential density equal to (cid:10) ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) k (cid:10) k ı ( (cid:7) i − r k ( t , (cid:2) ) ) , (cid:10) k is the potential of k th charge at the interface ) . Model parameters a and g C ( eq . ( 7 ) ) depend on cell elasticity , mechan - ical deformation and nature of cell migration . The long - time cell packing density change includes the additional mitotic term which accounts for cell proliferation rate as reported by Murray et al . [ 27 ] . 240 I .

( 32 ) Cell internal stress at the interface ( eq . ( 3 ) ) increases with the average matrix mass density (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) and its local gradient . The average matrix mass density at the interface is equal to : (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) j (cid:6) m j ı (cid:4) (cid:7) i − r j ( t , (cid:2) ) (cid:5) n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ( 8 ) where (cid:6) m j is the perturbed local matrix mass density caused by interactions with j - th cell located at the interface equal to (cid:6) m j ( t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) l m l ı (cid:4) r l − r j ( t , (cid:2) ) (cid:5) , r l is the radius vector of alginate chains located at the interface near the j - th cell , and m l is the mass of l - th alginate chain . Polysaccharide chains such as alginate are semi ﬂexible . For understanding the matrix structural changes , it is necessary to consider the nanometer effects related to polymer chains con - formations and inter and intra chain interactions . Haverkamp et al . [ 14 ] treated them as worm like chains while Josef et al . [ 11 ] reported that excluded volume effects should be accounted for into model - ing of the chain conformational changes . Free energy of alginate chains located at interface near the j th cell is equal to : F j = (cid:3) i V ( L l ) ( 9 ) where F j is the free energy of ensemble of alginate chains , L l is the end - to - end distance of l th chain , V is potential energy per single chain equal to V = − L (cid:2) 0 dς f ( ς ) , and f is the chain conformational force . Conformational changes of alginate chains also contribute to anomalous nature of energy dissipation during structural changes within the matrix primarily as a result of electrostatic interactions . The polymer matrix displacement ﬁeld at the interface u m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) depends on : ( 1 ) the nature of polymer chain conformations , and ( 2 ) cell elasticity , mechanical deformation and nature of cell migration . It could be expressed thermodynamically in the context of Langevin - type stochastic equation at mesoscopic level based on the formalism proposed by Ala - Nissila et al . [ 34 ] as : C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t ( u m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ) = ıF Int ( u m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ) ıu m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) + f d ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) + f N ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ( 10 ) where F Int ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the free energy functional which accounts for mechanical and electrical contributions at the interface , f d ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the driving force caused by the aggregate radial expansion equal to f d ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS u c ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) t , f N ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the multiplica - tive noise which accounts for interface inhomegenity caused by cell - polymer interactions equal to f N ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = k N n ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) (cid:12) ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) , (cid:12) ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is white noise , k N is the measure of cell - polymer interactions . Matrix partial disintegration and compression at the interface as well as liberation of Ca 2 + ions induce changes in the matrix electrical potential energy at the interface , which is equal to : U m el ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) l q l (cid:10) l ı ( (cid:7) i − r l ( t , (cid:2) ) ) ( where U m el ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the density of matrix electrical potential energy at the interface , q l and (cid:10) l are the charge and potential at l - th matrix part near the interface ) . Polymer matrix structural changes at the interface are caused by a convective mechanism as reported by Murray et al . [ 27 ] . Short time matrix convective ﬂux is expressed as : J mC ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t u m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ( 11 ) where J mC ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the matrix radial convective ﬂux . For struc - tural changes of ionic hydrogel such as Ca - alginate , the electrical ﬂux could be accounted for as a result of cell - matrix electrostatic interactions . The matrix mass density changes at the interface could be described by a modiﬁed expression proposed by Murray et al . [ 27 ] , by including cell bulk surface effects and cell surface - polymer surface effects ( Table 1 ) . It is expressed as : C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = − ∇ ( J mC ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) + J m el ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ) ( 12 ) where J m el ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) is the matrix radial electrical ﬂux caused by partial disintegration equal to J m el ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) = g m (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) ∇ (cid:10) ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) , g m is the measure of cell - matrix electrostatic interactions . I . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . / Colloids and Surfaces B : Biointerfaces 132 ( 2015 ) 236 – 245 241 2 . 2 . Matrix structural changes within the boundary layer Local matrix mass density located at r within the perturbed boundary layer around the cell aggregate at mesoscopic level is expressed as : (cid:6) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) k m k ı ( r − r k ( t , (cid:2) ) ) ( 13 ) where r k ( t , (cid:2) ) is the radius vector of k th matrix chain and r ∈ [ (cid:7) c ( t , (cid:2) ) , (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) ] and m k is the mass of k th alginate chain . The matrix structural changes within the boundary layer include polymer bulk volume effects related to polymer - polymer mechanical and elec - trostatic interactions . Short time matrix structural changes are expressed as : C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t (cid:6) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = − ∇ ( J mC ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + J m el ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ) ( 14 ) Local matrix mass density decreases from (cid:6) m ( (cid:7) i , t , (cid:2) ) at the interface to (cid:6) m 0 at (cid:7) = (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) , along with the local matrix charge density (cid:6) m e ( r , t , (cid:2) ) expressed as (cid:6) m e ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) k q k ı ( r − r k ( t , (cid:2) ) ) ( where q k is the k th charge of the matrix part ) . For long - time changes , the same has been expressed by neglecting the anomalous nature of energy dissipation [ 27 ] : ∂ (cid:6) m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) ∂(cid:2) = − ∇ ( J mC ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) + J m el ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) ) ( 15 ) where J mC ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) = (cid:6) m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) ∂ u m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) / ∂(cid:2) . If long - time cell rearrangement induces the anomalous nature of energy dissi - pation , it also induces the anomalous nature of energy dissipation during the long - time matrix structural changes . In that case , the derivative d / d (cid:2) should be modiﬁed to C 0 D (cid:8) mesoL t ( where C 0 D (cid:8) mesoL t is the fractional derivative for the long - time matrix structural changes and (cid:8) mesoL is the long - time damping coefﬁcient at mesoscopic level ) . When (cid:6) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ≥ (cid:6) mC indicates partial disintegration of the matrix network ( where (cid:6) mC is the maximum matrix density which corresponds to reversible , elastic compression of the Ca - alginate network ) , number density of polymer chain segments within the un - perturbed matrix is equal to (cid:6) m 0 . For ionic hydrogel matrix such as Ca - alginate , the partial disintegration has been expressed by Pajic - Lijakovic et al . [ 9 ] as a fraction of disintegrate junction zones within the boundary layer : y ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = n Zd ( r , t , (cid:2) ) n ZT ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ( 16 ) where n Zd ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is the number density of disintegrated junction zones , and n ZT ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is the total number density of junction zones . Short and long - times matrix structural changes have been treated thermodynamically as disorder - to - order phase transitions . Both quantities : ( 1 ) the local matrix density and ( 2 ) the local fraction of disintegrate junction zones , account for polymer bulk volume effects under compression caused by cell expansion . They could be used to formulate the thermodynamic order parameter . Changes in the order parameter have been described by formulating the free energy functional . 2 . 2 . 1 . Matrix rearrangement : order to disorder phase transition – thermodynamical approach Firstly , we will consider the matrix structural changes within the perturbed boundary layers around the cell aggregates based on thermodynamical approach and then , we will apply the similar approach to consider the Ca - alginate microbead part after coarse graining . Murray et al . [ 27 ] quantiﬁed the matrix state in the layer around the immobilized cell aggregate by the local matrix mass density (cid:6) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) . For short - time dynamics , the order parameter could be connected with the local matrix mass density and expressed as : ˚ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:6) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) − (cid:6) m 0 ( where r is the radial coordinate such as r ∈ [ (cid:7) c ( t , (cid:2) ) , (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) ] , (cid:6) m 0 is the density of un - perturbed matrix ) . For long - time dynamics , the order parameter could be expressed similarly as ˚ m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) = (cid:6) m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) − (cid:6) m 0 . Modeling consideration of the matrix structural changes from the stand point of thermodynamics includes formulation of the balance of thermodynamical afﬁnities based on Langevin - types equations [ 34 , 35 ] . Thermodynamical afﬁnities describe polymer bulk volume effects related to polymer - polymer mechanical and electrostatic interactions within the matrix boundary layers around the cell aggregates ( Table 1 ) . A general form of the model equa - tion for the short - time matrix structural changes should include the anomalous nature of energy dissipation and expressed as : C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t ˚ m = (cid:9) ˚ ı F m ( ˚ m ) ı ˚ m + g ( ˚ m ) ( 17 ) where (cid:9) ˚ is the relaxation constant , F m ( ˚ m ) is the matrix free energy functional which accounted for mechanical and electrostat - ics contributions and g ( ˚ m ) is the stochastic afﬁnity . For long - time matrix structural changes , damping effects could be neglected as reported by Murray et al . [ 27 ] . In such a case , the corresponding relation is : ∂ ∂(cid:2) ˚ m = (cid:9) ˚ ı F m ( ˚ m ) ı ˚ m + g ( ˚ m ) ( 18 ) If long - time matrix strain generation induces anomalous nature of energy dissipation , the derivative d / d (cid:2) in eqs . 18 should be mod - iﬁed to C 0 D (cid:8) mesoL (cid:2) . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . [ 9 , 36 ] considered long - time structural changes of the parts of Ca - alginate microbeads caused by immo - bilized yeast cells growth . They experimentally determined permanent long - time increase of the matrix volume due to par - tial disintegration of the matrix . Matrix volume increase accounts for the macroscopic effects of the structural changes . It represents cumulative effects of the electrostatic repulsion between rela - tively stiff chains of polyelectrolyte as alginate pronounced at the microbead surface . These changes indicate the irreversible matrix strain as dominant , even at the initial phase of cell growth . Con - sequently , they formulated the order parameter for the microbead part located at x which consists of a few cell aggregates and a part of hydrogel matrix as : ˚ m ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) = y ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) ( 19 ) where y ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) is the local fraction of disintegrated junction zones within the microbead part located at x . The order parame - ter changes within the microbead parts include cumulative effects of : ( 1 ) cell - bulk volume effects ( mechanical cell - cell interactions ) , ( 2 ) cell - bulk surface effects ( mechanical cell - polymer interactions ) , ( 3 ) cell surface - polymer surface effects ( electrostatic cell - matrix interactions ) and ( 4 ) polymer - bulk volume effects ( mechanical and electrostatic polymer - polymer interactions ) . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . [ 9 ] formulated a system of the Langevin - type model equations for considering the Ca - alginate network pseudo - phase connected to disconnected transition caused by cell growth as the modiﬁcation of so called model C [ 34 ] : ∂(cid:6) C ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) ∂(cid:2) = − (cid:9) ˚ ıF m [ (cid:6) C ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) , ˚ m ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) ] ı(cid:6) C ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) + (cid:6) C ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) (cid:12) (cid:6) ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) ( 20 ) ∂˚ m ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) ∂(cid:2) = (cid:9) ˚ ıF m [ (cid:6) C ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) , ˚ m ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) ] ı˚ m ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) + ˚ m ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) (cid:12) ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) ( 21 ) 242 I . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . / Colloids and Surfaces B : Biointerfaces 132 ( 2015 ) 236 – 245 where (cid:9) ˚ determines the rate of long - time relaxation toward the equilibrium state and (cid:6) C ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) is the local number density of cells within the microbead part equal to (cid:6) C ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) l ı ( x − x l ( t eq , (cid:2) ) ) , and x l ( t eq , (cid:2) ) is the radius vector of l - th cell aggregate consists of (cid:14) N ( (cid:2) ) (cid:15) cells . Second terms of eqs . 20 and 21 repre - sent multiplicative noises while (cid:12) (cid:6) ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) and (cid:12) ( x , t eq , (cid:2) ) are Gaussian white noises . The multiplicative noises terms describe non - homogeneity within the both sub - systems . If long - time matrix and cell strains generation induces the anomalous nature of energy dissipation the derivative d / d (cid:2) in eqs . 20 and 21 should be modiﬁed to C 0 D (cid:8) mesoL t . Matrix structural change described by the order param - eter is induced by the strain generated within the boundary layer around the cell aggregate . 2 . 2 . 2 . Matrix structural changes at mesoscopic level – rheological approach Shear and volume radial deformations of matrix around the cell aggregate at mesoscopic level are described from the stand point of continuum mechanics by Murray et al . [ 27 ] as : ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = 1 2 ( (cid:16) ∇ (cid:16) u m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + (cid:16) ∇ (cid:16) u m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) T ) ( 22 ) where ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is the radial shear strain tensor , while the volume strain tensor ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is : ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = (cid:16) ∇ • (cid:16) u m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ( 23 ) where r ∈ [ (cid:7) c ( t , (cid:2) ) , (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) ] ) . Short - time changes of the shear and volume matrix strains include the anomalous nature of energy dis - sipation caused by short - time cell rearrangement and depend on the damping coefﬁcient (cid:8) mesoS . Cell aggregate rearrangement and growth could induce : ( 1 ) elastic deformation of the matrix and ( 2 ) partial disintegration of the matrix . Long - time matrix structural changes could also induce the anomalous nature of energy dissi - pation depending on cell type and hydrogel rheological behavior . Then , the damping effects of long - time matrix structural changes could be quantiﬁed by (cid:8) mesoL . Perturbed matrix within the boundary layer causes generation of the matrix resistance stress which has the feedback impact on cell growth within the immobilized cell aggregate . Hunt et al . [ 24 ] reported that Ca - alginate hydrogel behaves as viscoelastic solid . Murray et al . [ 27 ] proposed a matrix stress - strain relation in the form of Kelvin - Voigt equation suitable for viscoelastic solid . Short - time matrix stress generation could be described by modiﬁed rheological constitutive model proposed by Murray et al . [ 27 ] in a form of fractional Kelvin - Voigt equation . Such an approach allows for the inclusion of the anomalous nature of the resistance stress generation . The model includes shear and volume contributions to stress : ˜ (cid:5) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = ˜ (cid:5) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + ˜ (cid:5) mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ( 24 ) where r is the radial coordinate such that r ∈ [ (cid:7) c ( t , (cid:2) ) , (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) ] , ˜ (cid:5) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is the volume contribution to the matrix stress and ˜ (cid:5) mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is the shear contribution to the matrix stress . The short - time shear contribution to the matrix stress is : ˜ (cid:5) mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = E (cid:10) m ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + (cid:16) 1 meff C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ( 25 ) where E (cid:10) m = E m / 1 + (cid:17) m , E m is the Young’s modulus , (cid:17) m is the bulk modulus of elasticity , (cid:16) 1 meff is the effective matrix shear modulus and (cid:8) mesoS is the damping coefﬁcient which quantiﬁed the anoma - lous nature of the short - time matrix stress generation within the already deformed hydrogel boundary layer . The short - time volume contribution to matrix stress is : ˜ (cid:5) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = E (cid:10) m (cid:17) (cid:10) m ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + (cid:16) 2 meff D (cid:8) mesoS t ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ( 26 ) where (cid:17) (cid:10) m = (cid:17) m / 1 − 2 (cid:17) m and (cid:16) 2 meff is the effective matrix volumet - ric modulus . The ﬁrst terms of the right hand side of Eqs . ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) represent the reversible ( elastic ) part and the second terms include the anomalous nature of the matrix stress generation . If the parameter (cid:8) m = 0 , we obtain C 0 D 0 t ( ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ) = ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) and C 0 D 0 t ( ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ) = ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) . In that case , the second terms of Eqs . ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) additionally contribute to elastic Hookean behavior . When (cid:8) mesoS → 1 , we obtain C 0 D 1 t ( ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ) → ∂ ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) / ∂t and C 0 D 1 t ( ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ) → ∂ ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) / ∂t . In that case , the second term rep - resents the purely viscous contribution to the matrix stress and (cid:16) 1 meff → (cid:16) 1 m , (cid:16) 2 meff → (cid:16) 2 m ( where (cid:16) 1 m and (cid:16) 2 m are the shear and volume viscosities ) . Murray et al . [ 27 ] proposed the Kelvin - Voigt constitutive stress – strain model equation for long - time matrix structural changes by neglecting the damping effects . The long - time shear contribution to the matrix stress is : ˜ (cid:5) mS ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) = E (cid:10) m ˜ ε m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) + (cid:16) 1 m ∂ ˜ ε m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) ∂(cid:2) ( 27 ) while the long - time volume contribution to the matrix stress is : ˜ (cid:5) mV ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) = E (cid:10) m (cid:17) (cid:10) m ˜ ϑ m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) + (cid:16) 2 m ∂ ˜ ϑ m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) ∂(cid:2) ( 28 ) The ﬁrst terms of the right hand side of Eqs . ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) repre - sent the reversible ( elastic ) part , and the second terms represent the irreversible ( viscous ) part of the matrix stress contributions . If the long - time matrix stress generation induces anomalous effects , the derivative d / d (cid:2) in Eqs . ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) should be modiﬁed to C 0 D (cid:8) mesoL (cid:2) 2 . 2 . 3 . Matrix free energy – internal variable approach The local matrix structural changes within the boundary layer around the cell aggregate induce local free energy changes . These changes have been expressed by applying the internal variable theory [ 37 – 39 ] . The internal variable theory is a useful tool for considering the system irreversible structural changes . The local matrix state is described by the local shear and volume strains ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) and ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) as well as the corresponding internal vari - ables ˜ (cid:18) mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) for shear strain , and ˜ (cid:18) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) for volume strain . The internal variables represent the irreversible parts of the local shear and volume strains . Consequently , thermodynamic variables expressed per volume of the matrix boundary layer as : U m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = U mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + U mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) , where U m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is the internal energy which represents the sum of shear and volume contributions , s m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = s mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + s mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) is the entropy which represents the sum of shear and volume contributions and the Helmholtz free energy F m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = F mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + F mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) also represents the sum of shear and volume contributions . The Helmholtz free energy is equal to F m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = U m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) − Ts m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) depending on the local strains ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) and ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) as well as the internal variables ˜ (cid:18) mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) and ˜ (cid:18) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) . During short time matrix structural changes the boundary layer around the immobilized cell aggregate could be treated as a thermodynamic closed system . The short time free energy changes for the corresponding fractional Kelvin - Voigt model Eqs . ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) based on modiﬁed Atanackovic approach [ 37 ] is expressed as : C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t F m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = ( ˜ (cid:5) mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) − ˜ (cid:19) mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ) : C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) + ( ˜ (cid:5) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) − ˜ (cid:19) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ) : C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) ( 29 ) where r is the radial coordinate such as r ∈ [ (cid:7) c ( t , (cid:2) ) , (cid:7) m ( t , (cid:2) ) ] , ˜ (cid:19) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) represents the irreversible part of the matrix resistance stress , ˜ (cid:5) m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) the matrix stress tensor . The model I . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . / Colloids and Surfaces B : Biointerfaces 132 ( 2015 ) 236 – 245 243 equation satisfy the conditions C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t ˜ ε m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS ˜ (cid:18) mS ( r , t , (cid:2) ) t and C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS t ˜ ϑ m ( r , t , (cid:2) ) = C 0 D (cid:8) mesoS ˜ (cid:18) mV ( r , t , (cid:2) ) t which is in accordance with the fractional Kelvin - Voigt constitutive model . Free energy gen - eration within the already deformed matrix boundary layer is determined by the nature of suitable constitutive stress - strain rela - tion with the corresponding damping coefﬁcient (cid:8) mesoS . During long time matrix structural changes the boundary layer around the immobilized cell aggregate could be treated as a ther - modynamic open system . Long time free energy changes for the corresponding Kelvin - Voigt constitutive model Eqs . ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) is equal to : ∂ ∂(cid:2) F m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) = ( ˜ (cid:5) mS ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) − ˜ (cid:19) mS ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) ) : ∂ ∂(cid:2) ˜ ε m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) + ( ˜ (cid:5) mV ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) − ˜ (cid:19) mV ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) ) : ∂ ∂(cid:2) ˜ ϑ m ( r , t eq , (cid:2) ) ( 30 ) If the long - time matrix stress generation induces the anomalous nature of energy dissipation , the derivative d / d (cid:2) in Eq . ( 30 ) should be modiﬁed to C 0 D (cid:8) mesoL t . 2 . 3 . Cell and matrix volume changes at macroscopic level Cell and matrix volume changes account for the macroscopic effects related to : ( 1 ) cell - bulk volume effects ( mechanical cell - cell interactions ) , ( 2 ) cell - bulk surface effects ( mechanical cell - polymer interactions ) , ( 3 ) cell surface - polymer surface effects ( electrostatic cell - polymer interactions ) and ( 4 ) polymer - bulk volume effects ( mechanical and electrostatic polymer - polymer interactions ) . The microbead volume is equal to : V B ( t , (cid:2) ) = V CT ( t , (cid:2) ) + V m ( t , (cid:2) ) ( 31 ) where V B ( t , (cid:2) ) is the microbead volume V CT ( t , (cid:2) ) is the cell sub - system volume equal to V CT ( t , (cid:2) ) = N aggregates (cid:14) V C ( t , (cid:2) ) (cid:15) , (cid:14) V C ( t , (cid:2) ) (cid:15) is the ensemble averaged volume of single cell aggregate , V m ( t , (cid:2) ) is the matrix sub - system volume equal to V m ( t , (cid:2) ) = N aggregates (cid:14) V mB ( t , (cid:2) ) (cid:15) + V m 0 , (cid:14) V mB ( t , (cid:2) ) (cid:15) is the ensemble averaged volume of the perturbed matrix boundary layers , and V m 0 is the volume of un - perturbed matrix within the microbead . The short time rate of the microbead volume change includes the anomalous nature of energy dissipation primarily caused by anomalous nature of cell migration [ 28 , 29 ] and is expressed as : D (cid:8) macroS t V B ( t , (cid:2) ) = C 0 D (cid:8) macroS t V CT ( t , (cid:2) ) + C 0 D (cid:8) macroS t V m ( t , (cid:2) ) ( 32 ) where (cid:8) macroS is the damping coefﬁcient for short - time volume changes at macroscopic level . Higher value of the damping coefﬁ - cient indicates more intensive energy dissipation . Matrix structural changes within the boundary layers at the mesoscopic level are more irreversible than that at the macroscopic level . Macro - scopic matrix state changes include the contributions of : ( 1 ) the perturbed part of matrix within the boundary layers and ( 2 ) the un - perturbed matrix part . Consequently , macroscopic and mesoscopic damping coefﬁcients for the matrix strain generation satisfy the condition (cid:8) macroS ≺ (cid:8) mesoS . An important conclusion can be drawn from Eq . ( 32 ) : Short - time volume changes of both sub - systems follow the same law quantiﬁed by the damping coefﬁcient (cid:8) macro S . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . [ 10 ] reported that the long - time microbead structural ordering includes the anomalous nature of energy dissipation . It corresponds to : dV B ( t eq , (cid:2) ) d(cid:2) → C 0 D (cid:8) macroL V B ( t eq , (cid:2) ) (cid:2) ( where C 0 D (cid:8) macroL (cid:2) is the fractional derivative for the long - time changes , and (cid:8) macroL is the damping coefﬁcient for the long time changes such that (cid:8) macro L ≺ 1 ) . The macroscopic and mesoscopic damping coefﬁcients for the matrix long - time strain generation satisfy the condition (cid:8) macroL ≺ (cid:8) mesoL . 3 . Results and discussion Ca - alginate matrix structural changes caused by immobilized cell rearrangement and growth within the microbeads are con - sidered based on thermodynamical and rheological modeling approaches . Special attention is paid to the irreversible part of the phenomenon caused by mechanical and electrostatical multi scale cell - polymer and polymer - polymer interactions at the bio - interface which leads to the matrix weakening . Aggre - gates expansion induces compression of the surrounding hydrogel matrix within the perturbed boundary layers quantiﬁed by an increase of the local matrix mass and charge densities . However , irreversible matrix structural changes near the microbead sur - face could induce the thickening phenomenon . It represents a result of electrostatic repulsion between liberated polyelectrolyte chain parts . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . [ 9 ] observed that the matrix vol - ume increases within the Ca - alginate microbead during yeast cell growth . It points to the “thickening” as the dominant mechanism of matrix structural changes at macroscopic level . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . [ 10 , 36 ] reported that long - time matrix structural changes induce the anomalous nature of energy dissipation with the damp - ing effects . It represents a consequence of attractive forces action . The attractive forces of the network segments tend to keep the structural integrity and cause the damping of energy dissipation . These matrix structural changes are described by the fractional derivatives and quantiﬁed by the order of the fractional deriva - tive ( the damping coefﬁcient ) . The value of the damping coefﬁcient could be lower or equal to one . Higher value of the damping coef - ﬁcient points to a more intensive energy dissipation during the structural changes within the system . Short and long - times cell rearrangement and growth induce anomalous nature of : ( 1 ) the cell and matrix strains generation and ( 2 ) the stresses generation within the both sub - systems ( Fig . 2 ) . The anomalous nature of energy dissipation for short - time dynamics is primarily caused by the anomalous nature of cell migration as well as by the cumulative effects of the alginate chains conformational changes . It is quantiﬁed by the damping coefﬁ - cient (cid:8) mesoS . The short - time cell aggregate radial displacement and the displacement rate induce the matrix radial strain within the boundary layer around the aggregate . The matrix resistance stress is further generated within the already deformed matrix . The frac - tional Kelvin - Voigt stress - strain relation describes the nature of the stress generation . Irreversible part of the stress at mesoscopic level is quantiﬁed by the damping coefﬁcient (cid:8) mesoS . Higher value of the damping coefﬁcient (cid:8) mesoS corresponds to a more intensive hydro - gel partial disintegration during the strain generation . Long - time cell rearrangement and growth could induce the anomalous nature of energy dissipation depending on cell type and matrix rheologi - cal behavior . Just like in the case of short time dynamics , long - time matrix stress generation within already deformed matrix could be quantiﬁed by the damping coefﬁcient (cid:8) mesoL . Short and long - times macroscopic microbead volume changes induce the anomalous nature of energy dissipation quantiﬁed by the damping coefﬁcient (cid:8) macroS and (cid:8) macroL . Matrix sub - system at macroscopic level consists of : ( 1 ) the perturbed part within the boundary layers around the aggregates and ( 2 ) the un - perturbed surrounding matrix part . Cell sub - system at macroscopic level con - sists of the ensemble of cell aggregates such that : ( 1 ) the number of aggregate is constant and ( 2 ) the number of cells per aggregate increase during cell growth time period . Energy dissipation phe - nomenon at mesoscopic level within the boundary layers is more intensive then that within the whole matrix at macroscopic level 244 I . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . / Colloids and Surfaces B : Biointerfaces 132 ( 2015 ) 236 – 245 Fig . 2 . Cell - polymer interactions - schematic representation of this complex process which includes the damping effects of the microbead structural ordering . due to presence of the un - perturbed matrix part . Consequently , the damping coefﬁcients (cid:8) macroS and (cid:8) macroL should be lower than (cid:8) mesoS and (cid:8) mesoL . The key model parameter which quantiﬁes the hydrogel weak - ening could be the fraction of disintegrated junction zones . Hunt et al . [ 24 ] considered the Ca - alginate hydrogel weakening caused by ﬁbroblast growth . This phenomenon is quantiﬁed as a decrease of the microbead storage and loss moduli . The storage modulus of the microbead for a weakening phenomenon accounts for the macroscopic effects of the microbead structural changes . It could be expressed as [ 40 ] : G (cid:10) B ( t eq , (cid:2) ) = G (cid:10) m ( t eq , (cid:2) ) ( 1 − a c (cid:10) c ( t eq , (cid:2) ) b c ) ( where G (cid:10) B ( t eq , (cid:2) ) is the microbead storage modulus , G (cid:10) m ( t eq , (cid:2) ) is the matrix storage modulus , (cid:10) c ( t eq , (cid:2) ) is the cell volume fraction equal to (cid:10) c ( t eq , (cid:2) ) = (cid:3) i V C i ( t eq , (cid:2) ) / V B ( t eq , (cid:2) ) , V C i ( t eq , (cid:2) ) is the volume of i th cell aggregate , V B ( t eq , (cid:2) ) is the microbead volume , and a c and b c are the constitutive model parameters which represent the mea - sure of cell - polymer mechanical and electrostatic interactions at the bio - interface . The matrix storage modulus could be corre - lated with a fraction of disintegrated junction zones based on rheo - kinetical approach [ 41 ] as : G (cid:10) m ( t eq , (cid:2) ) ∼ y ( t eq , (cid:2) ) − 1 ( where y ( t eq , (cid:2) ) is the fraction of disintegrated junction zones within the microbead ) . The nature of the microbead stress generation during the microbead weakening could be estimated by considering the long - time changes of the storage modulus in the context of the rheo - kinetical approach . Short and long - time changes of : ( 1 ) the microbead volume and ( 2 ) the microbead storage and loss moduli are easily mea - surable parameters and useful tools for considering the dissipative phenomena during the matrix structural ordering caused by immo - bilized cell rearrangement and growth . These multi scale modeling considerations could be applied to describing structural changes of : ( 1 ) various types of alginate hydrogels [ 16 , 42 ] , ( 2 ) alginate based composites with agarose [ 43 , 44 ] , polyvinyl alcohol [ 45 ] , collagen [ 46 ] and ( 3 ) other anionic polysaccharide hydrogels such as pectin [ 47 ] caused by immobilized cell growth . Various types of algi - nate hydrogels are made by various cross - linking molecules . Lee et al . [ 16 ] and Eiselt et al . [ 42 ] proposed covalently cross - linking of alginate with adipic dihydrazeide , methyl ester l - lysine and poly ( ethylene glycol ) - diamines for improving its elasticity and mechan - ical stability . Shen [ 43 ] proposed 1 . 3 % alginate - agarose microbeads for hybridoma cells immobilization . Pajic - Lijakovic [ 44 ] compared hybridoma cells growth in 1 . 3 % alginate - agarose microbeads pro - posed by Shen [ 43 ] and 2 % Ca - alginate microbeads proposed by Bugarski et al . [ 1 ] based on a mathematical model developed for estimating micro environmentally restricted hybridoma cell growth . She indicated that a higher matrix resistance stress is gen - erated within 1 . 3 % alginate - agarose microbeads . Tsai et al . [ 46 ] pointed out that composite matrix made by alginate with colla - gen is more suitable for growth of immobilized GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells than pure alginate hydrogel . Voo et al . [ 47 ] compared poultry probiotic cell growth within Ca - alginate , Ca - pectinate and Ca - alginate / pectinate beads . They pointed out that pectin based beads are more mechanically stabile ; however the achieved cell concentration is higher within Ca - alginate beads . It would be use - ful to determine irreversible structural changes and the compare generation of the matrix resistance stress within various types of hydrogels ; based on the proposed multi scale modeling approaches presented herein , and look further into their various biotechnolo - gical and biomedical applications . 4 . Conclusions The proposed models estimate complex multi - scale interactions among immobilized cell aggregates and the surrounding matrix within the Ca - alginate microbeads at various space scales : ( 1 ) at I . Pajic - Lijakovic et al . / Colloids and Surfaces B : Biointerfaces 132 ( 2015 ) 236 – 245 245 the bio - interface , ( 2 ) within the perturbed boundary layers around the cell aggregates , ( 3 ) within the microbead parts ( consists of a few cell aggregates with perturbed matrix boundary layers and un - perturbed matrix parts ) and ( 4 ) within the microbead as a whole . The irreversible nature of the matrix structural changes considered at various space scales is modeled at two time scales i . e . a long time scale ( cell growth time ) , and a short time scale ( cell rearrangement time ) . A comparison of various modeling approaches shed light on the essential mechanism of the structural changes of the matrix sub - system caused by cell rearrangement and growth . The mech - anism is connected with energetically perturbed cell states caused by the interactions with the polymer matrix at the bio - interface . The perturbed cell states are a product of cell deformation , ori - entation , as well as changes of cell - to - cell separation distances and cell growth . These cell states and the rate of their changes induces perturbation of the matrix state at the interface and within the boundary layers around the immobilized cell aggre - gates . The mechanisms of structural ordering of both sub - systems induce time delaying effects which lead to the anomalous nature of energy transfer and dissipation through the microbeads . The phe - nomenon could be related to the micro - environmentally restricted cell growth which has a great practical importance in prediction and optimization of various bio - processes such as : ( 1 ) mechanically suppressed tumor growth , ( 2 ) cell growth and products secretion , ( 3 ) artiﬁcial organs formation . Energy transfer from the cells to the matrix and energy dissi - pation induces generation of the resistance matrix stress which leads to internal cell stress generation . Matrix stress - strain con - stitutive relations for short and long time structural changes are described by rheological equations . Various models for matrix structural ordering are proposed based on thermodynamics and statistics by including coarse graining in order to formulate multi - scale interactions at mesoscopic and macroscopic levels and to describe the dynamics at the bio - interface . Bearing in mind that mathematical models represent only a simpliﬁed description of this complex phenomenon , we stress the importance of a thermo - dynamical approach ( which includes deterministic and stochastic parts of the phenomenon ) for a better understanding of the nature of multi scale interactions which lead to the Ca - alginate partial disintegration . For practical applications , it is necessary to optimize the matrix rheological behavior in order to regulate the matrix resistance stress generation . The matrix stress depends on the irreversible nature of structural changes of both sub - systems quantiﬁed by the damping coefﬁcients . Higher values of the damping coefﬁcient for the matrix strain generation are caused by the more intensive matrix disintegration . Considering long and short - times changes of the easily mesurable variables such as : microbead volume , cell number den - sity per microbead , microbead storage and loss moduli could be useful for understanding the coarse - consequence relations which cause the Ca - alginate microbead weakening .
