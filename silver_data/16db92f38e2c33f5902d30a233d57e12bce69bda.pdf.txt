mutations that diminish the autophagy path - way . Remarkably , a hallmark of motor neuron pathology in > 95 % of sporadic and familial ALS patients is the formation of TARDBP in - clusions , which suggests that defects in ribo - stasisareacommon featureofthe disease ( 5 , 49 ) . The prominence of this disease mechanism in ALS has been proposed to be the consequence of the normal function of low - complexity domains in RNA binding proteins in the assembly of func - tional “ RNA granules ” such as P - bodies and stress granules [ see ( 37 ) for detailed discussion ] . Our exome sequencing study has identified var - iants that definitively predispose humans to a sporadic , complex human disease . Larger exome sequencing studies may reveal identifiable roles for genes that have not yet achieved significant associations . There is reason for optimism that such studies will begin to fill in an increasingly complete picture of the key genes implicated in ALS , providing multiple entry points for ther - apeutic intervention ( Fig . 3 ) . It is also likely that whole - genome sequencing ( especially with lon - ger reads ) will prove of particular value in ALS , given that there are many causal variants refrac - tory to identification by contemporary exome se - quencing . Finally , we note that effective studies will depend critically on the control samples avail - able . For example , we used the recently released ExAC data set of > 60 , 000 samples to focus on extremelyrarevariantsinoursamples ( 50 ) . Well - characterized , publicly available control sam - ple sets will be of great importance for further discovery of variants associated with complex traits , in particular for whole - genome sequenc - ing studies .

Carter 1 † Dynactin is an essential cofactor for the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein - 1 . We report the structure of the 23 - subunit dynactin complex bycryo - electron microscopy to 4 . 0 angstroms . Our reconstruction reveals how dynactin is built around a filament containing eight copies of the actin - related protein Arp1 and one of b - actin . The filament is capped at each end by distinct protein complexes , and its length is definedbyelongated peptides that emerge from the a - helical shoulderdomain . A further 8 . 2 angstrom structure of the complex between dynein , dynactin , and the motility - inducing cargo adaptor Bicaudal - D2 shows how the translational symmetry of the dyneintailmatchesthatofthedynactinfilament . TheBicaudal - D2coiledcoilrunsbetweendynein and dynactin to stabilize the mutually dependent interactions between all three components . D ynactin works with the cytoplasmic dynein - 1 motor ( dynein ) to transport cargos along the microtubule cytoskeleton ( 1 – 3 ) . Togeth - er , these protein complexes maintain the cell ’ s spatial organization , return compo - nents from the cell ’ s periphery , and assist with cellular division ( 4 ) . Mutations in either complex cause neurodegeneration ( 5 ) , and both can be co - opted by viruses that travel to the nucleus ( 6 ) . Dynein and dynactin are similar in size and SCIENCE sciencemag . org 27 MARCH 2015 (cid:127) VOL 347 ISSUE 6229 1441 RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLES complexity . Dynein contains two copies of six different proteins and has a mass of 1 . 4 MD . Dynactin , at ~ 1 . 0 MD , contains more than 20 subunits , corresponding to 11 different proteins . Dynactin is built around a filament of actin - related protein 1 ( Arp1 ) . In analogy to actin , the filament has a barbed end and a pointed end , each capped by a different protein complex . On top sits the shoulder domain ( 7 ) from which emerges a long projection , corresponding to dy - nactin ’ s largest subunit , p150 Glued ( DCTN1 ) ( 8 ) . Despite the presence of a dynein binding site in p150 Glued ( 9 – 11 ) , purified dynein and dynactin form a stable complex only in the presence of the cargo adaptor Bicaudal - D2 ( BICD2 ) ( 12 – 14 ) , a coiled - coil protein associated with transport of vesicles , mRNAs , and nuclei ( 15 ) . This interac - tion activates dynein and converts it into a highly processive motor ( 13 , 14 ) . Current models for dynactin ’ s architecture ( 7 , 16 , 17 ) and its interaction with dynein ( 13 , 14 ) come from low - resolution negative - stain and platinum - shadowing electron microscopy ( EM ) . A number of questions remain . What makes the filament in dynactin short and defined , when puri - fied Arp1 filaments vary in length ( 18 ) ? How does dynein bind to dynactin , and why does the in - teraction require BICD2 ( 12 – 14 ) ? Why does dynac - tin , the cofactor for a microtubule motor , contain an actin - related filament ? To address these ques - tions , we took advantage of recent advances in cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) ( 19 ) to improve our structural understanding of dynactin . Dynactin structure determination Dynactin is a challenging target for cryo - EM ( 17 ) . This complex ’ s extreme preferred orientation on EM grids makes it hard to obtain the broad dis - tribution of views required for a three - dimensional ( 3D ) reconstruction . Furthermore , dynactin ’ s thin elongated shape limits its contrast , making it dif - ficult to assign views accurately . We overcame these hurdles ( 20 ) to determine cryo - EM maps of native dynactin purified from pig brain ( fig . S1 ) , initially at 6 . 3 Å ( Dynactin - 1 in table S1 ) and sub - sequently at 4 . 0 Å overall and 3 . 5 Å in the dynactin filament ( Dynactin - 2 , - 3 , and - 4 in table S1 ; Fig . 1 , A and B ; fig . S2 ; and movies S1 and S2 ) . We used both maps to build a model of dynactin ( Fig . 1C and table S2 ) . The filament and pointed - end – capping protein Arp11 were built de novo and refined ( table S3 ) . Homology models of the barbed - end – capping protein CapZ ab ( 21 ) and the pointed - end proteins p25 ( DCTN5 ) and p27 ( DCTN6 ) ( 22 ) were fitted into density . The pointed - end protein p62 and the shoulder — which contains p150 Glued ( DCTN1 ) , p50 ( dynamitin or DCTN2 ) , and p24 ( DCTN3 ) — were built as backbone models ( Fig . 1D ) . The dynactin filament contains eight Arp - 1 subunits and one b - actin The dynactin filament is nine subunits long and consists of two protofilaments that wrap around each other ( Fig . 1 , A and C ) : five subunits ( A , C , E , G , and I ) in the top protofilament and four ( B , D , F , and H ) in the bottom . The presence of b - actin in the filament is controversial ( 7 , 23 ) . Our cryo - EM map was of sufficient quality ( fig . S3A ) to show that subunit H is b - actin ( b - actin – H ) , where - as the others are Arp1 ( Arp1 - A to Arp1 - I ) . We con - firmed the presence of Arp1 and b - actin at an 8 : 1 ratio by mass spectrometry ( MS ) – based label - free quantitative proteomic analysis ( table S4 ) . Capping the dynactin filament The dynactin filament is similar to that of actin ( 24 ) , consistent with the high ( 53 % ) sequence identity between b - actin and Arp1 ( fig . S3B ) . Both consist of four subdomains surrounding a nu - cleotide binding site ( fig . S4 ) . A key contact with - in the filament is the subdomain - 2 loop binding the groove between subdomains 1 and 3 on the neighboring subunit . Blocking this interaction provides a mechanism to cap both actin and dynactin filaments . At the barbed end of dynactin , a CapZ ab het - erodimer binds across both protofilaments . The C - terminal helices ( tentacles ) of CapZ a and CapZ b fit into the groove between subdomains 1 and 3 on Arp1 - B and Arp1 - A ( Fig . 2A , fig . S5 , and movie S3 ) and prevent further subunit binding . CapZ ab interacts with dynactin in the same way as proposed for the actin filament ( 25 ) . How - ever , there is a loop ( called the “ plug ” ) ( 24 ) that contains four negatively charged residues in Arp1 but only one in actin ( Fig . 2B ) . This loop is close to a cluster of four positively charged residues on CapZ a , suggesting that CapZ ab binds Arp1 with a higher affinity than actin . This explains why a pool of CapZ ab remains bound to dynactin but not to actin , when most CapZ ab is depleted by small interfering RNA ( 26 ) . The tight binding of CapZ ab reflects its role in stabilizing dynactin ’ s structure . At the pointed end , the bottom protofilament ends in b - actin , whereas the top ends in Arp1 1442 27 MARCH 2015 (cid:127) VOL 347 ISSUE 6229 sciencemag . org SCIENCE 1 Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Division of Structural Studies , Francis Crick Avenue , Cambridge CB2 0QH , UK . 2 Department of Chemistry , Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory , University of Oxford , Oxford OX1 3QZ , UK . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Corresponding author .

This creates a distinctive binding site for Arp11 , the most evolutionarily distant of all the actin - related proteins ( 27 ) . Our structural data reveal how a single Arp11 subunit can cap both protofilaments . The bottom protofilament directly binds Arp11 , preventing further subunit addition because its subdomain - 2 loop is too short ( 27 ) ( Fig . 2C ) . Subunit addition to the Arp1 - I subunit on the top protofilament is blocked sterically by subdomain 4 of Arp11 ( asterisk in Fig . 2D ) and also because the Arp1 - I subdo - main - 2 loop is sequestered by Arp11 ( Fig . 2D ) . Arp11 binds p25 , p27 , and p62 to form the pointed - end complex ( Fig . 2E ) . The p25 and p27 subunits consist of a triangular b - sheet structure ( 22 ) followed by an a helix ( fig . S6 ) . They pack side to edge ( fig . S6A ) and bind end - on to Arp11 ( Fig . 2F ) . The interaction is reinforced by p62 , which wraps around the Arp11 : p25 - p27 contact site ( Fig . 2E ) . Only Arp11 directly caps the pointed end , suggesting that the other components have a different role , such as cargo attachment ( 28 ) , and explaining why some fungal species contain Arp11 but lack p25 , p27 , and p62 ( 29 ) . The p150 Glued projection extends more than 50 nm from the shoulder Previous antibody labeling showed that p150 Glued forms dynactin ’ s shoulder projection ( 7 ) . Exist - ing models suggest that it is 24 nm long and contains the p150 Glued N - terminal Cap - Gly do - main and the CC1A coiled coil ( Fig . 3A ) ( 7 , 8 ) . Owing to its flexibility , the projection is not visible in our high - resolution EM maps . However , we determined an 8 . 6 Å structure from a subset of particles ( Fig . 3B , table S1 , and fig . S7 ) in which it is visible because it docks against the side of dynactin ( fig . S8 , A and B ) . The projection is more than 50 nm long and contains three coiled coils , which we assigned to those in p150 Glued on the basis of their length ( fig . S8C ) . An ~ 18 - nm coiled coil ( CC2 ) emerges from the shoulder and joins a globular domain consisting of a dimer ( fig . S8D ) of two ~ 40 - kD subunits [ intercoiled do - main ( ICD ) ] . Another ~ 24 - nm coiled coil ( CC1B ) extends from the ICD before doubling back for ~ 18 nm ( CC1A ) . Our model predicts that the Cap - Gly domain at the N terminus of CC1A is lo - cated close to the ICD . This is not visible in our structure , owing to its flexibility and because the majority of our dynactin contains the shorter isoform of p150 Glued ( p135 ) , which lacks a Cap - Gly domain ( Fig . 3A ) . Our 50 - nm projection is sim - ilar in appearance to structures observed in the images of dynactin viewed by rotary shadowing ( 7 ) . Furthermore , the interaction made by CC1A folding back onto CC1B agrees with recent bio - chemical data ( 30 ) . The shoulder ’ s symmetry is broken by binding the dynactin filament Previous models suggest that the shoulder con - sists mainly of p150 Glued ( 8 ) . Our finding that most of p150 Glued is in the projection implies that the shoulder contains predominantly p24 and p50 . We confirmed that dynactin contains four copies of p50 and two copies of p24 ( 27 ) , be - cause the mass of dynactin calculated from this stoichiometry matches ( table S5 ) that measured by MS ( 1 , 066 , 889 daltons ) ( Fig . 3C ) . We verified this composition by tandem MS ( Fig . 3D ) and by measuring the resulting subcomplexes ( table S5 ) . The shoulder ’ s flexibility results in a lower - resolution cryo - EM map and makes it chal - lenging to assign individual a helices to specific proteins . Instead , the structures reveal an in - trinsic twofold symmetry of the shoulder that was not obvious in previous images of dynactin ( 17 ) . The shoulder contains two identical arms ( Fig . 3 , E and F ) made of bundles of three a helices ( Fig . 1D ) that meet at a dimerization domain ( fig . S9A ) . The end of each arm meets another short bundle of helices at an acute angle ( hook domain ) and a variably positioned paddle domain ( Fig . 3E and fig . S9B ) . The sym - metry between the two arms is broken as they twist to contact the dynactin filament . The stoichiometry of p24 and p50 and their predicted helical and coiled - coil structures ( 8 , 31 ) suggest that each arm contains one helix from p24 and two from p50 . The length of p24 ( 186 residues ) is similar to the length of one arm , whereas that of p50 ( 401 residues ) is longer , suggesting that p50 contributes to other struc - tures such as the hook or paddle domain . The two p150 Glued copies enter the shoulder between the two arms ( Fig . 3F ) and then split and run SCIENCE sciencemag . org 27 MARCH 2015 (cid:127) VOL 347 ISSUE 6229 1443 Fig . 2 .

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLES along each arm before joining the hook domains . Thus , the role of the p150 Glued C terminus is to stick the two p50 - p24 arms together . Extended peptides from the shoulder span the length of the dynactin filament The invariant size of the dynactin filament im - plies that some mechanism specifies its length ( 7 , 17 , 32 ) . The shoulder is the best candidate for dynactin ’ s molecular ruler . Its main body con - tacts four Arp1 subunits close to the barbed end ( fig . S10 ) . In addition , four extended regions ( ERs ) emerge from the shoulder and coat the rest of the filament ( Fig . 4 ) . The ends of all four are structurally identical ( fig . S11 , A to D ) , which sug - gests that they correspond to p50 , the only tetra - mer in dynactin ( 8 ) . The ERs are most likely the N termini of p50 , which are predicted to be un - structured , contain a sequence that fits the clearest parts of the ER density ( fig . S11E ) , and are able to displace the shoulder from the dynactin fila - ment ( 26 ) . Two pairs of ERs emerge from each shoulder paddle ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . One of each pair contacts the top protofilament : ER - 1 runs from Arp1 - C to Arp1 - E and ER - 2 from Arp1 - G to Arp1 - I ( Fig . 4C ) . The other reaches down to con - tact the bottom protofilament : ER - 3 runs from Arp1 - B to Arp1 - D , and ER - 4 contacts Arp1 - F ( Fig . 4D ) . The ends of all four ERs occupy a positively charged groove on the dynactin filament that is equivalent to the tropomyosin binding groove on actin ( 33 ) ( fig . S12 , A and B ) . Although it is structurally different from tropomyosin ( 24 ) , the N terminus of p50 is similarly rich in negatively charged residues ( fig . S12C ) , which explains why both bind an equivalent site . 1444 27 MARCH 2015 (cid:127) VOL 347 ISSUE 6229 sciencemag . org SCIENCE Pointed end Barbed end Dimerizationdomain Arm - 2 Paddle Paddle Hook p62 Arp11 p25 / p27 Arm - 1 Shoulder Projecting density Inside shoulder Cap - Gly CC1B ICD CC2 Dimerizationdomain Arm - 1 Paddle Paddle Hook Arm - 2 ( p50x2 , p24x1 ) Hook p150 Glued / p135 C - term CC1A Cap - Gly CC1ACC1B CC2 ICD C - term 217 548 926 1049 350 CC2 CC1A CC1B ICD 1 1278 p150 Glued p135 135 Paddle Hook 1 , 066 , 889 Da m / z 10000 5000 25000 15000 20000 30000 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y ( % ) 0 100 68 + 56 + 48 + 36 + 33 + 31 + 1500 2000 2500 m / z R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y ( % ) 0 100 68 + 13000 15000 17000 m / z 20 + 16 + 12 + - CapZ β - p25 - p62 - CapZ α - p27 p27 Fig . 3 .

RESEARCH | RESEARCH ARTICLES The shoulder and its ERs contact every fila - ment subunit except for b - actin – H ( fig . S12 , D and E ) , suggesting the following model for dynactin assembly . The shoulder and ERs re - cruit eight Arp1s and stabilize their polymer - ization into a structure with five subunits on the top protofilament and three on the bot - tom . The gap in position H is filled by b - actin , perhaps owing to actin ’ s high abundance in the cell . The interface formed by Arp1 - I and b - actin – H specifically recruits Arp11 . Together with CapZ ab binding to the barbed end , this results in a highly stable complex of an exactly defined length . Dynein and BICD2 bind the dynactin filament Dynein , dynactin , and the N terminus of BICD2 ( BICD2N ) form a stable complex only when all three components are present ( 12 – 14 ) . In this dynein - dynactin - BICD2N ( DDB ) complex , dynein binds dynactin via its tail , whereas its motor do - mains remain flexible ( 13 ) . Currently there are no 3D structures of either the dynein tail or its in - teraction with dynactin . We therefore formed a stable tail - dynactin - BICD2N ( TDB ) complex ( fig . S13 ) and determined its structure by cryo - EM to 8 . 2 Å ( fig . S14 and movie S4 ) . The dynein tail binds directly to the Arp1 fila - ment ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) , stretching from b - actin – H to the barbed end . The interaction is stabilized by a ~ 270 - residue coiled coil of BICD2N that runs the length of the filament . Projections of the TDB complex are very similar to negative - stain images of the DDB complex ( fig . S15 ) ( 13 ) , suggesting that the flexible , C - terminal motor domains of dynein lie close to the barbed end of dynactin ( fig . S15 ) . To determine the orientation of BICD2N , we re - moved the N - terminal green fluorescent protein tag ( table S1 and fig . S16 ) and showed that the globular density at one end disappeared ( fig . S16 ) . Therefore , the BICD2N N terminus lies close to the barbed end , and its C terminus emerges from the pointed end . The C terminus of BICD2 and the pointed - end complex of dynactin , which are implicated in cargo binding ( 28 , 34 ) , are thus diametrically opposed to the dynein motor do - mains ( Fig . 5A ) . The dynein heavy chain contains an N - terminal dimerization domain The dynein tail consists of two copies of the dynein heavy chain ( DHC ) , intermediate chain ( DIC2 ) , light intermediate chain ( DLIC1 ) , and light chains ( Roadblock , Tctex , and LC8 ) . The tail , within the TDB complex , contains two elongated S - shaped domains corresponding to the DHCs : chain 1 and chain 2 ( Fig . 5C ) . The DHC C termini , which contain the binding site for DLIC1 ( 35 ) , are mainly disordered ( Fig . 5B ) . The middle of each DHC wraps around a circular density correspond - ing in size , shape , and position ( 35 ) to the WD40 b propeller of DIC2 ( Fig . 5C and fig . S17 ) . Toward their N termini , the two DHC chains are joined by a small ( ~ 40 kDa ) globular domain ( Fig . 5C ) . We hypothesized that this domain represents a previously unknown dimerization domain of the DHC itself . To verify this , we determined a crystal structure of the N - terminal 557 amino acids of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DHC ( Dyn1 1 - 557 ) to 5 Å resolution ( Fig . 5D , fig . S18 , and table S6 ) . This shows two elongated domains , made up of bun - dles of a helices , that fit well with the helices ob - served by cryo - EM ( fig . S18 , C and D ) . Furthermore , it reveals that the elongated domains are joined by an N - terminal dimerization domain ( Fig . 5D ) . Inthecrystalstructure , theelongateddomains are related by rotational symmetry , with their C termini pointing in oppositedirections ( Fig . 5D ) . In the TDB structure , each elongated domain has rotated about the flexible connection to the dimerization domain ( movie S5 ) so that they lie parallel to each other ( Fig . 5E ) . This is probably caused by the light - chain – mediated dimeriza - tion of DIC2 ( 36 , 37 ) , which serves to hold the DHCs together toward their C termini .

They bindadjacentcleftsbetweenArp1 - Dand - F ( chain1 ) andArp1 - Fand b - actin – H ( chain2 ) ( Fig . 5 , FandG ) . These sites are equivalent to the myosin motor binding site on actin ( fig . S19 and movie S6 ) . The translational symmetry between DHC chains is lost toward their C termini as chain 2 twists relative to chain 1 ( Fig . 5C ) . Chain 2 makes no further contacts withthedynactin filament , whereaschain1 bindsit again at Arp1 - A and - C ( Fig . 5H ) . BICD2Nisinvolvedinallinteractionsbetween the dynein tail and the dynactin filament ( Fig . 5 , F , G , and H ; and movie S7 ) . In the clefts between Arp1 - D and - F and between Arp1 - F and b - actin – H , BICD2N stabilizes the interaction of the DHC chains with the filament ( Fig . 5G ) . At the Arp1 - A and - C site , BICD2N sits between chain 1 and dynactin . The network of contacts from BICD2N to dynein , BICD2N to dynactin , and dynein to dynactin explains why all three components must be present to form a stable complex ( 12 – 14 ) . The long BICD2N coiled coil may be suited as a car - go adaptor because it spans the length of the dynactin filament . Many other dynein adaptors — including TRAK1 and - 2 ( 38 ) ; RILP ( 39 ) ; and Rab11 - Fip3 , Hook3 , andSpindly ( 14 ) — containcoiled coils and may recruit dynein and dynactin in a similar way . The requirement to form a three - way complex would reduce the chance of stochastic binding of dynein to its cargos . The shoulder coats three sides of the filament ( fig . S12 , D and E ) , leaving the front face freefor interaction with BICD2N and the dynein tail . We do not observe a direct interaction between the shoulder and dynein in our structure . However , the well - reported interaction between the p150 Glued CC1 region of dynactin and the N terminus of DIC2 ( 11 ) is too flexible to be visualized direct - ly . The p150 Glued projection binds to the same face of the dynactin filament as BICD2N ( Figs . 3B and 5 , A and B ) , and both occupy the same cleft on the pointed - end complex ( fig . S8B and Fig . 5B ) . Thus , BICD2N binding could free p150 Glued CC1 to make contact with DIC2 and so add an additional contact that stabilizes the TDB complex . How does recruitment of dynactin by a cargo adaptor ( 13 , 14 ) activate dynein ? Both the micro - tubule binding Cap - Gly ( 14 ) and DIC2 binding CC1B ( 30 ) regions of p150 Glued have been impli - cated . Our structure raises a third , but not mutual - ly exclusive , possibility . Studies with artificially dimerized dynein motor domains suggest that they self - associate in an auto - inhibited conforma - tion unless they are sufficiently separated ( 40 ) . We suggest that dynactin activates the motor do - mains by reorienting the two DHCs . Both DHC N termini are anchored parallel to each other , but the C termini are forced to twist apart because only one chain binds the second site on dynactin . This hypothesis explains why dynactin is built around an actin - like filament . The translational symmetry of the filament matches that of the DHC N termini , whereas the filament length pro - vides additional binding sites that force dynein to adopt its active conformation .
