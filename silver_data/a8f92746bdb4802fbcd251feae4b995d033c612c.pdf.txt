Dyche Mullins †‡ * Graduate Group in Biophysics and † Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology , University of California at San Francisco , 513 Parnassus Avenue , San Francisco , CA 94143 Edited by Thomas D . Pollard , Yale University , New Haven , CT , and approved October 19 , 2001 ( received for review August 9 , 2001 ) The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , a seven - subunit protein complex containing twoactin - relatedproteins , Arp2andArp3 , initiatesformationofactin ﬁlament networks in response to intracellular signals . The molecular mechanism of ﬁlament nucleation , however , is not well understood . Arp2 and Arp3 are predicted to bind ATP via a highly conserved nucleotide - binding domain found in all members of the actin super - family and to form a heterodimer than mimics a conventional actin dimer . We show here that adenosine nucleotides bind with micro - molar afﬁnity to both Arp2 and Arp3 and that hydrolyzable ATP is required for actin nucleation activity . Binding of N - WASP WA in - creases the afﬁnity of both Arp2 and Arp3 for ATP but does not alter the stoichiometry of nucleotides bound in the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex bound to ADP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP - PNP cannot nucleate actin ﬁla - ments , butadditionofthephosphateanalogueBeF 3 partiallyrestores activity to the ADP – Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex . Bound nucleotide also regulates theafﬁnityoftheArp2 (cid:1) 3complexforitsupstreamactivatorsN - WASP and ActA . We propose that the active nucleating form of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is the ADP - P i intermediate in the ATPase cycle and that the ATPase activity of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex controls both nucleation of new ﬁlaments and release of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex from membrane - associated activators . T he actin cytoskeleton determines the shape , motility , and internal organization of eukaryotic cells . Many actin - based structures , especially those involved in membrane protrusion , are assembled by coordinated polymerization and crosslinking of new actin filaments from actin monomers into either orthogonal or parallel filament networks ( 1 ) . In these structures , work is accomplished by the free energy of polymerization . Subsequent ATP hydrolysis by filamentous actin then allows the networks to be disassembled . The rapid and regulated assembly and disas - sembly of actin filament networks lies at the heart of many cellular processes that involve membrane protrusion such as cell locomotion , endocytosis , and phagocytosis ( 2 ) . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex plays a central role in the regulated assembly of actin - based structures . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex nucleates formation of new actin filaments in response to upstream signaling events and simultaneously crosslinks them into orthogonal net - works . Activation of Rho - family G proteins , including Rac and Cdc42 , leads to dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton ( 3 , 4 ) . Rac and Cdc42 promote activation of members of the WASP family of proteins ( 5 – 7 ) that include WASP , N - WASP , and several isoforms of Scar ( 8 ) . WASP family proteins , in turn , recruit and activate the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( 7 , 9 , 10 ) . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex nucleates formation of new actin filaments from the sides of older filaments , creating a dendritic network of crosslinked actin fila - ments in vitro ( 11 , 12 ) and in vivo ( 13 ) . We proposed that activation of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex involves the two actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 , forming a heterodimer that mimics a conventional actin dimer and nucleates a new actin filament ( 14 , 15 ) . Actin - related proteins and other members of the actin superfamily , such as molecular chaperones like Hsc70 , apyrases like ecto - apyrase HB6 , and sugar kinases like hexokinase and glycerokinase , share a core structural fold , the actin fold , which forms an adenosine nucleotide - binding site ( 16 ) . In these proteins , the actin fold couples ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release to conformational changes that control , for example , actin filament stability ( 17 – 19 ) and the affinity of Hsc70 for unfolded proteins ( 20 ) . Actin monomer – monomer interactions within a filament are stronger in the ATP and the ADP - P i states ( 21 , 22 ) than in the ADP state . Incontrast , Hsp70bindsitssubstratesweaklyintheATPstate but tightly in the ADP state ( 23 ) . Bound nucleotide regulates the affinities of several members of the actin superfamily for their substrates , therefore we speculated that bound nucleotide might also regulate the interaction of Arp2 and Arp3 and control the formation of an Arp2 – Arp3 nucleus . To address these questions , we characterized nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex and investigated the role of the bound nucleotide in the biochemical activity of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex . Materials and Methods Purification of Proteins . We purified the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex from Acanthamoeba castellanii by a combination of conventional and affinity chromatography . We resuspended 75 g of Acanthamoeba in two volumes of lysis buffer ( 11 % sucrose (cid:1) 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 (cid:1) 5 mM DTT (cid:1) 1 mM ATP (cid:1) 1 mM EGTA (cid:1) 2 mM PMSF (cid:1) 0 . 1 mM benzamidine (cid:1) 1 mg leupeptin (cid:1) 4 mg soybean trypsin inhibitor (cid:1) 1 mg pepstatin A (cid:1) 1 mg aprotinin ) , and lysed cells in a dounce homog - enizer . We spun the lysate at 13 , 000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor for 20 min to remove cell debris , and then in a Ti50 . 2 rotor at 38 , 000 rpm for 90 min . We collected the layer of supernatant between the pellet and lipid layer and bound it in batch for 20 min to 100 ml of DEAE resin equilibrated in column buffer ( 100 (cid:1) M ATP (cid:1) 1 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) (cid:1) 2 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 (cid:1) 1 mM DTT ) . DEAE flow - through was loaded on a 15 - ml C200 column ( Cellufine 200 ( m ) ; Millipore ) . We collected the flow - through , added 25 mM KCl , and passed it over a 2 - ml CH - Sepharose ( Activated CH - Sepharose 4B ; Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences , Uppsala , Sweden ) N - WASP WA ( 398 – 501 ) affinity column . We washed the resin with 10 volumes each of 25 mM and 100 mM KCl in column buffer . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex was eluted with 400 mM MgCl 2 and passed over a 400 (cid:1) l phenyl - Sepharose column ( no . 6 Fast - Flow low sub ; Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences ) then either gel filtered on a 30 - ml Superdex S - 200 column equilibrated with KMEI buffer or exchanged into KMEI by using a PD - 10 desalting column ( Amersham Pharmacia Bio - sciences ) . The complex was concentrated by dialysis against sucrose and dialyzed overnight into KMEI buffer ( 50 mM KCl (cid:1) 1 mM MgCl 2 (cid:1) 1 mM EGTA (cid:1) 0 . 5 mM TCEP (cid:1) 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) (cid:1) 100 (cid:1) M ATP for use in assays . Typical yields were (cid:2) 6 mg of pure Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex from 75 g of packed cells . The protein was never freeze - thawed or stored for more than 1 week . Typically it was used within 24 h of purification . Actin was purified from Acanthamoeba by the method of Mac - Lean - Fletcher and Pollard ( 24 ) .

Phalloidin – actin was allowed to continue poly - merizing overnight on ice , and nucleotide was removed the follow - ing day by 2 treatments with 5 % Dowex resin ( AG 1 - X8 resin , Bio - Rad ) at 4°C . Residual denatured actin monomers were re - moved by centrifugation at 20 , 000 (cid:3) g for 10 min . Recombinant rat N - WASP - WA ( 398 – 502 ) with an N - terminal 6His tag was purified by nickel - affinity chromatography , using standard methods . Assay Conditions . All assays were performed in KMEI buffer at 25°C . Free nucleotide was removed from the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex before assays by 2 – 4 treatments for 3 min each with 5 % volumes of Dowex resin . UV Crosslinking Studies . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex was used at 1 – 2 (cid:1) M , F - actin was used at 10 (cid:1) M , and N - WASP WA was used at 25 (cid:1) M . For normal ATP crosslinking , a stock solution of 300 (cid:1) M ATP in KMEI was doped with 150 (cid:1) Cu [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP . For azido - ATP crosslinking , we used a stock of [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] azido - ATP at 500 (cid:1) M . Free nucleotide was removed from the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex by 4 treatments with 5 % Dowex resin . We incubated the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex in KMEI for 20 min with labeled ATP and then photo - crosslinked bound nucleotide to the protein by exposing the mixture to UV light . For ATP , the UV exposure was 30 s , and for azido - ATP 1 . 5 – 19 s ( 312 nm UV handlamp , Fisher Scientific ) ( 25 ) . Subunits were separated by SDS (cid:1) PAGE . 32 P labeling was quantified by using a PhosphorImager ( Storm 840 , Molecular Dynamics ) and data fit to a binding quadratic with DYNAFIT ( 26 ) to obtain dissociation constants . HPLC . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex in KMEI plus 100 (cid:1) M ATP was exchanged into KMEI plus 0 (cid:1) M , 1 . 4 (cid:1) M , or 10 (cid:1) M ATP by using a PD - 10 buffer - exchange column ( Amersham Pharmacia Bio - sciences ) . Exchange took less than 2 min , and flow - through was collected in 150 (cid:1) l fractions . Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex concentration was determined by A290 ( 7 . 14 (cid:1) M (cid:1) OD ) . The peak fraction ( (cid:2) 5 (cid:1) M ) was heat - denatured , and buffer plus released nucleotide was sep - arated from denatured protein by filtration through a 10 - kDa MWCO filter ( UltraFree - MC , Millipore ) . Nucleotide was quanti - fied by HPLC in 75 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 4 . 0 (cid:1) 1 . 5 mM tetrabutylam - monium phosphate (cid:1) 12 % methanol on a C18 column ( Waters DeltaPak 15 (cid:1) M 100A 300 (cid:3) 3 . 9 mm ) at 1 ml (cid:1) min ( 27 ) . The concentration of nucleotide in the column buffer was subtracted from that in the sample and this was divided by the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex concentration to calculate the number of bound nucleotides per complex . For the N - WASP WA condition , the PD - 10 column was preequilibrated in 25 (cid:1) M N - WASP WA , and 25 (cid:1) M N - WASP WA was added to the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex before loading onto the column . Etheno - ATP Affinity Measurement . Free nucleotide was removed from the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex by 4 treatments with 5 % Dowex resin . Etheno - ATP fluorescence was measured ( (cid:3) ex (cid:4) 340 nm , (cid:3) em (cid:4) 420 nm ) for 100 (cid:1) l of KMEI (cid:1) 0 . 8 (cid:1) M Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex (cid:1) 30 (cid:1) M etheno - ATP (cid:1) 200 mM acrylamide [ as a dynamic quencher ( 28 ) ] . This solution was serially diluted with 50 % volumes of 0 . 8 (cid:1) M Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex (cid:1) 200 mM acrylamide in KMEI to titrate down etheno - ATP concentrations . Etheno - ATP (cid:1) Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex flu - orescence was linear with etheno - ATP concentration , for concen - trationsgreaterthan10 (cid:1) M , andwefitthislinearportionofthedata to f (cid:4) a (cid:1) b [ eATP ] to find b , the contribution of unbound etheno - ATP to the measured fluorescence . We subtracted back - ground protein fluorescence and free etheno - ATP fluorescence from the measured fluorescence to obtain the enhancement due to etheno - ATP binding and data fit to the binding quadratic to obtain dissociation constants . Measurement of ATP Hydrolysis . We determined steady - state ATP hydrolysis rates at 25°C in KMEI buffer . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex was used at 4 . 4 (cid:1) M , N - WASP WA was used at 25 (cid:1) M , and F - actin was used at 15 (cid:1) M . Free nucleotide was removed from the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex by 2 treatments with 5 % Dowex resin , and the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex was brought up to room temperature . [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP ( 50 (cid:1) Ci ) and 500 (cid:1) M ATP concentrations were added to start the reaction . Aliquots ( 5 (cid:1) l ) were quenched with equal volumes of 5 M formic acid , spotted on polyethyleneimine - cellulose TLC plates , and separated by chromatography with 0 . 6 M KH 2 PO 4 ( pH 3 . 4 ) . [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP and product [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ADP were quantified by using a PhosphorImager and normalized by the starting ATP concentration . Kinetic Assays . We measured the time course of nucleotide release from the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex by the increase in fluorescence intensity of etheno - ATP ( (cid:3) ex (cid:4) 360 nm , (cid:3) em (cid:5) 389 nm ) on binding to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , using a hand - operated rapid mixer ( SFA - 20 ; HiTech Scientific , Salisbury , U . K . ) and fluorimeter ( K2 ; ISS , Champagne , IL ) . Samples were excited at 360 nm , and emission was measured at (cid:5) 389 nm by using a long pass filter ( KV389 ; Schott , Duryea , PA ) . We used 1 – 2 (cid:1) M Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex in KMEI buffer , treated 2 times with 5 % Dowex just before use to remove free nucleotide . For ATP and ADP , off - rate mea - surements , 100 (cid:1) M nucleotide was added to the buffer , excess removed once more by using Dowex , and 5 (cid:1) M nucleotide added immediately before use . The dissociation rate for nucleotide was measured by competing off the bound nucleotide with 50 (cid:1) M etheno - ATP . Fluorescence data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting to a single exponential function . Polarization Anisotropy . N - WASP WA ( 398 – 501 ) was labeled on cysteine 427 in 2 mM Hepes (cid:1) 500 mM KCl plus 4 - fold molar excess of rhodamine maleimide ( Molecular Probes ) overnight at 4°C . The sample was centrifuged at 350 , 000 (cid:3) g for 20 min , and the supernatant gel was filtered on a Sephacryl S - 300 column to remove free dye and denatured protein . ActA ( 30 – 170 ) was labeled as in Zalevsky et al . ( 29 ) . By this procedure , proteins were (cid:2) 25 % labeled as determined by A280 and A554 . Polarization anisotropy was measured for 250 nM labeled protein in the presence of various concentrations of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex in KMEI plus 1 mM nucleotide ( ATP , ADP , or AMP - PNP ) , and the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex concentration was titrated by serial dilution . Relative affinities of labeled and unlabeled protein were mea - sured by monitoring anisotropy of labeled protein in competition with unlabeled protein . Labeled N - WASP WA was determined to bind 4 - fold tighter than unlabeled N - WASP WA in the presence of ATP and ADP . Anisotropy data were fit to a model accounting for fraction of unlabeled protein and their different affinities by using DYNAFIT ( 26 ) . Actin Polymerization Assays . Acanthamoeba actin doped with 10 % pyrene - labeled actin was used to monitor actin polymerization by fluorescence ( (cid:3) ex (cid:4) 365 nm , (cid:3) em (cid:4) 407 nm ) ( 30 , 31 ) . ATP - and ADP - actin were prepared on ice by incubating in respective nucle - otides for (cid:5) 10 min before briefly treating twice with 5 % Dowex resintoremoveunboundnucleotide . Polymerizationreactionswere performed at room temperature . We started seeded polymeriza - tion assays by mixing prepolymerized filamentous actin seeds in 1 . 1 (cid:3) KMEI plus 110 (cid:1) M nucleotide with 10 (cid:1) l ATP - or ADP - actin . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex - nucleated polymerization was started by mixing 90 (cid:1) l of 11 nM Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex plus 1 . 2 (cid:1) M N - WASP WA plus 110 (cid:1) M nucleotide in 1 . 1 (cid:3) KMEI ( (cid:6) filamentous actin seeds ) with 10 (cid:1) l doped ATP - or ADP - actin . Kinetic modeling was done by using the Macintosh version of BERKELEY MADONNA ( R . Macey , T . Zahnley , and G . Oster , Univ . of California , Berkeley , CA ) . 14872 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 261419298 Dayel et al . Results and Discussion The Arp2 and Arp3 Subunits of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 Complex Bind Nucleotide with Micromolar Affinity . To identify the subunits of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex that bind nucleotide , we crosslinked the radiolabeled photoreactive ATP derivative [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] azido - ATP to the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex by using UV light . Samples were allowed to equilibrate for several minutes before crosslinking . For short crosslinking times , Arp2 is preferentially labeled , and for longer crosslinking times , labeledazido - ATPspecificallycrosslinkstoboththeArp2andArp3 subunits ( Fig . 1 A ) . This finding supports the prediction of Kelleher et al . ( 14 ) that Arp2 and Arp3 contain nucleotide - binding sites similar to the nucleotide - binding pocket of conventional actin . We measured the affinity of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex for nucleotide by three methods , UV crosslinking , etheno - ATP fluorescence , and nucleotide dissociation kinetics , and obtained essentially identical results . Radiolabeled nucleotides lacking the photoreactive azido group can be crosslinked to both Arp2 and Arp3 but with greatly reduced crosslinking efficiency . We measured the affinities of each of the actin - related proteins to ATP by analysis of the photo - crosslinking with [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP . This method works because pho - tocrosslinking with ATP crosslinks only a small fraction of the total protein ( see Fig . 5 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , www . pnas . org ) . We crosslinked [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP to the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex with UV light and quantified labeling of Arp2 and Arp3 with increasing concentrations of [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP to con - struct a binding isotherm ( Fig . 1 B and C ) . At saturation , Arp2 labels only 20 % as strongly as Arp3 , presumably reflecting a lower relative crosslinking efficiency because of different amino acid residues contacting the nucleotide ( 32 ) . From this binding isotherm we determined that Arp3 binds ATP with a K d of 0 . 6 (cid:1) M and Arp2 with a K d of 1 . 3 (cid:1) M ( Fig . 1 C ; Table 1 ) . In the presence of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex activator N - WASP WA , the nucleotide affinity increases (cid:2) 3 - fold on both subunits to 0 . 25 (cid:1) M on Arp3 and to 0 . 5 (cid:1) M on Arp2 . In addition , the efficiency of Arp3 labeling decreases in the presence of N - WASP WA , suggesting that it induces a change in the structure of the nucleotide - binding pocket . We also measured the affinity of the entire Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex for the fluorescent nucleotide analog , etheno - ATP , by monitoring the increase in etheno - ATP fluorescence on binding to the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( Fig . 1 D ) . Consistent with the UV crosslinking results , the affinity of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex for etheno - ATP increases in the pres - ence of NWASP WA from 3 . 1 (cid:1) m to 1 . 3 (cid:1) m . There is also an increase in the magnitude of the etheno - ATP fluorescence change in the presence of N - WASP WA , further evidence that N - WASP altersthestructureofthenucleotide - bindingpocketofArp2and (cid:1) or Arp3 . To test this hypothesis , we added 1 . 0 (cid:1) M etheno - ATP to 6 (cid:1) M nucleotide - free Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex . Under these conditions , 90 % of the etheno - ATP will be bound to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex . Subsequent addition of N - WASP increased etheno - ATP fluorescence 2 - fold further ( unpublished observations ) , indicating that the fluores - cence enhancement is due entirely to a change in the local envi - ronment of the nucleotide . The binding of N - WASP WA has been shown to cause a conformational change on the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( 33 ) . We would expect that a conformational change might alter the residues that contact the adenosine ring of ATP or the etheno group of etheno - ATP . Such changes would explain the observed changes in the efficiency of crosslinking of [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP and the degree of fluorescence enhancement for etheno - ATP . We measured the dissociation rates for nonfluorescent nucleo - tides by competing off bound unlabeled nucleotide with etheno - ATP ( Fig . 1 E ) , and assuming association rate constants equal to actin ( 34 ) , calculated the dissociation rate constants summarized in Table 1 . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex binds MgATP with an affinity of 0 . 5 (cid:1) M , 400 times less tightly than actin binds MgATP [ 1 . 2 nM ( 34 ) ] , and binds MgADP 3 - fold tighter than it binds MgATP . In the presence of N - WASP , the affinity for ATP increases 3 – 4 - fold , and we note an enhancement of the fluorescence change of (cid:2) 2 - fold . The efficiency of UV crosslinking of ATP and the fluorescence of etheno - ATP both change on the binding of N - WASP to the Fig . 1 .

To be certain that the number of nucleotides bound is the same in the presence and absence of N - WASP WA , we used HPLC to quantitate the total amount of nucleotide bound by the complex ( Table 2 ) . In buffer containing enough free ATP to saturate both the binding sites ( 10 (cid:1) M ) , the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex binds two nucleotides per complex , and this number does not change in the presence or absence of N - WASP WA . Bound Nucleotide Affects the Affinity of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 Complex for Its Upstream Activators . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex binds its activators N - WASP WA and ActA 3 – 4 - fold more tightly in saturating con - centrations of ATP than in ADP ( Fig . 2 ) . Rapid release of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex from its activators is a general requirement for efficient motility . In the case of Listeria motility , the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex activator , ActA , is permanently attached to the bacterium while the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex remains part of the actin network , which treadmills away from the bacterium surface during motility . High - resolution positional measurements ( 35 ) suggest that the speed of Listeria movement is limited by release of attachments between the bacterium and actin filaments in the tail . We know of two such attachments ( i ) via VASP and ( ii ) via the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex . VASP binds to the sides of filaments with 10 nM affinity ( 36 ) and to ActA with (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) M affinity ( 37 ) . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex binds to the pointed ends of new filaments with 10 – 50 nM affinity ( 11 ) and to full - length ActA with an affinity of 0 . 6 (cid:1) M ( 29 ) . If these are the only connections between the bacterium and the actin comet tail , ActA binding to the ATP – Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex would be the rate - limiting interaction . If the ATP on the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is hydrolyzed to ADP on nucleation , ActA would bind the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex less tightly ( Fig . 2 Inset ) and its effect on motility would be decreased . By this mechanism , an Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex activator could bind and recruit the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex with high affinity and then release it before the binding retards motility . We propose that the same may be true for the endogenous WASP - family proteins . WASP and N - WASP associate with the membrane - anchored G protein Cdc42 , and the affinity of N - WASP for the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex also depends on the bound nucleotide ( Fig . 2 ) . Although these proteins are not permanently membrane - anchored like the transmembrane ActA protein , wehypothesizethattheseupstreamactivatorsremainatthe membrane after activating the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , released by a decrease in affinity after nucleotide hydrolysis . TheArp2 (cid:1) 3ComplexRequiresHydrolyzableATPtoNucleateNewActin Filaments . We carried out pyrene - actin polymerization assays to test the ability of N - WASP - stimulated Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex to nucleate new filaments when bound to different nucleotides or nucleotide ana - logues . Because actin itself binds nucleotide , we needed to be certain that we were observing an effect of nucleotide on Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex nucleation and not an effect that nucleotide in solution might have on actin polymerization . We therefore measured the elongation of 2 (cid:1) M MgATP - actin with no free ATP from phal - loidin - stabilized actin seeds in the presence of 100 (cid:1) M ATP , ADP , and AMP - PNP ( Fig . 3 A ) . Kinetics of polymerization are indepen - dent of added nucleotide within the first 100 s of starting the reaction but diverge soon after this , because of the exchange of nucleotide on the monomeric actin with nucleotide in solution ( 38 ) . Therefore , insubsequentexperimentswiththeArp2 (cid:1) 3complex , we limited our observations to the first 100 s of the reaction . We used N - WASP WA at 3 times its saturating concentration for the ATP - Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex to be certain that we were not simply seeing an effect of nucleotide on N - WASP affinity . As expected in this 100 - s time window , the ATP – Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex activated by N - WASP WA rapidly nucleates new actin filaments ( Fig . 3 B ) . Our Fig . 2 .

We next wanted to test the ability of the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex to nucleate new filaments in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog , AMP - PNP . AMP - PNP - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex has an affinity for ActA ( 30 – 170 ) that is similar to that of the ATP - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ( Fig . 2 ) . We found that AMP - PNP - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is unable to nucleate new filaments ( Fig . 3 B ) . This finding is consistent with our previous results showing that G protein - stimulated Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex - dependent actin polymerization in Acanthamoeba extracts requires hydrolyzable ATP ( 39 ) . We then tested whether ADP - BeF 3 , which simulates an ADP - P i conformation for actin ( 21 , 40 ) , supports Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex activation . Adding BeF 3 to the ADP – Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex partially restores nucleation activity ( Fig . 3 B ) . These results suggest either ( i ) that the ADP - P i - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is the active form and AMP - PNP Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is inactive , because AMP - PNP cannot be hydrolyzed , or ( ii ) that the ATP - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is the active form and that ADP - BeF 3 looks more like ATP to the complex than AMP - PNP . We favor the first possibility because mathematical modeling of the kinetics of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex activation seem to require a hydrolysis step ( below ) . The Hydrolysis of ATP by the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 Complex May Account for the First - Order Activation Step in Arp2 (cid:1) 3 Complex - Dependent Actin As - sembly . We propose that the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex must hydrolyze ATP to nucleate a new filament . Marchand et al . ( 41 ) and Zalevsky et al . ( 33 ) noticed that affinity of wild - type and mutant WASP family proteins for the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex does not corre - late with ability to activate the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex and suggested that some further activation step ( s ) must occur between activa - tor binding and filament nucleation ( 41 ) . ATP hydrolysis may be the rate - limiting activation step in nucleation . ATP hydrolysis is a first - order reaction and we can incorporate this hydrolysis step into a kinetic scheme for filament formation : F (cid:4) A ATP (cid:4) N (cid:4) G O ¡ k a F (cid:1) A ATP (cid:1) N (cid:1) G O ¡ k hyd F (cid:1) A ADP - P i (cid:1) N (cid:1) G , where F is F - actin , A is Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , N is N - WASP , G is G - actin , and the F . A ADP - P i . N . G form is the active nucleus . We fixed the association constants for the components in the reaction ( here grouped together as k a ) to determined values ( 11 ) . We fit this scheme to polymerization data collected during N - WASP - stimulated pyrene - actin polymerization experiments and calculated the hydrolysis rate , k hyd , for the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex during the polymerization reaction to be 0 . 02 s (cid:7) 1 . To achieve this ATP hydrolysis rate , the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex must be stimulated by some combination of filamentous actin , monomeric actin , and N - WASP . N - WASPandF - ActinDoNotStimulateATPHydrolysisbyArp2 (cid:1) 3Complex . ToinvestigatethebasalATPhydrolysisrateoftheArp2 (cid:1) 3complex , we incubated the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex with 500 (cid:1) M ATP doped with [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ATP and quantified the amount of [ (cid:2) - 32 P ] ADP produced over time by TLC . We were unable to detect ATP hydrolysis within the limits of our measurement , suggesting that the basal Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ATP hydrolysis rate is less than 0 . 1 (cid:3) 10 (cid:7) 3 s (cid:7) 1 ( data not shown ) . We could not use the TLC method to directly measure the ATPase rate of Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex in the presence of F - actin , N - WASP , and actin monomers , because the actin monomers themselves would hydrolyze ATP as they polymerize . We measured Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ATPase activity in the presence of N - WASP and F - actin in the absence of the actin monomers but found no significant ATPase activity above control levels ( data not shown ) . Because adding F - actin and N - WASP to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex does not change the hydrolysis rate , and hydrolysis seems to occur during activation , we suggest that actin monomers may be required to stimulate Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ATPase activity . All Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex activators that promote rapid nucleation contain actin monomer - binding WH2 domains in close proximity to an Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex - binding domain . We suggest the role of the WH2 domain may be to place a monomer in contact with a filament - bound Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex and stimulate ATP hydrolysis . Hydrolysis of ATP to an ADP - P i state would then cause a conformational change that allows Arp2 , and an actin monomer Arp3 , to associate and form a nucleus . Model for the Link Between ATP Hydrolysis and Actin Nucleus For - mation . Based on our data , we propose a model ( Fig . 4 ) relating Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex ATPase activity to its actin filament nucleation activity . Step 1 : Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex binds to the activator with high affinity , because Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is ATP - bound . Binding N - WASP Fig . 3 .

Kinetics of polymerization are independent of solution nucleotide within the ﬁrst 100 s of starting the reaction but diverge soon after this , because of the exchange of nucleotide with solution . We therefore limited our observations to the ﬁrst 100 s when using ATP - actin . ( B ) The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex induces polymerization of MgATP - actin in the presence of ATP or ADP - BeF3 but not AMP - PNP or ADP . We used the fact that nucleotide in solution exchanges onto Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex within seconds ( Fig . 1 E ) buttakesmuchlongertoexchangeontoactinmonomers ( 38 ) toloadonetypeofnucleotideontotheArp2 (cid:1) 3complex , butkeepATPbound to actin . We mixed 2 (cid:1) M MgATP - actin with a solution of 10 nM Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex and 1 . 2 (cid:1) M N - WASP WA ( 3 - fold above saturating concentration ) with 100 (cid:1) M ATP , ADP , ADP (cid:1) 2 mM BeF3 , or AMP - PNP .

Step 3 : A new actin filament polymerizes from this nucleus . Step 4 : Phosphate release from Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex decreases the affinity for N - WASP and allows the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex to release its membrane - associated activator .

Step 1 : Assembly of F - actin , Arpd (cid:1) 3 complex , and activator . The Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex binds to the activator , in this case N - WASP , with high afﬁnity because the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex is ATP - bound . Binding N - WASP brings the actin monomer attached to the WH2 domain of N - WASP in contact with the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex and this stimulates ATP hydrolysis .
