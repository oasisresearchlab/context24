Decolonial and Postcolonial Computing Research : A Scientometric Exploration Dipto Das dipto . das @ colorado . edu Department of Information Science University of Colorado Boulder Boulder , Colorado , United States Bryan Semaan bryan . semaan @ colorado . edu Department of Information Science University of Colorado Boulder Boulder , Colorado , United States ABSTRACT Decolonial and postcolonial computing scholars focus on the rela - tionship between coloniality and technology . While many recent empirical and design studies have adopted these theoretical lenses , these conversations are often disconnected . Through a systematic literature review , we seek to understand patterns within and be - tween decolonial computing and postcolonial computing . As an early step toward that objective , this poster presents results from our preliminary scientometric exploration of 115 papers’ metadata and discusses research trends and popular publication venues in these areas . Using citation network analysis , we found smaller communities in decolonial and postcolonial computing scholarship based on their use of theoretical frameworks , objectives , types of pa - pers , authors’ collaboration and affiliations , and research sites and populations . We conclude by discussing future research directions to bring these communities into conversations with each other .

Two discourse groups emerged exploring the relationship between societies and coloniality – postcolonial and decolonial [ 14 ] which are often viewed as competing traditions . Drawing on prior litera - ture [ 14 , 26 ] , we argue that decolonial and postcolonial perspectives are complementary . Studies by postcolonial computing scholars are fundamental for understanding the colonial impulses of technology , power hierarchy in design , cultural differences in technological practices , etc . [ 31 , 45 ] . As a response to these understanding and lessons , research from the point of view of decolonial computing can help us shape critical technical practices , seek reverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies and center the voices from the margins [ 5 , 67 ] . A systematic literature review ( SLR ) of the published works in decolonial and postcolonial computing can help us put scholars of these domains into conversations for a holistic understanding of how technologies perpetuate colonial hierarchies and prejudices and ways to resist those influences . Though qualitative SLRs are more common in social computing [ 51 , 73 , 80 ] , quantitative or scientometric SLRs which are particularly useful to unpack the evolutionary nuances of a specific field while shedding light on the emerging areas within that field [ 28 ] , have also previously appeared in the broader HCI community [ 1 , 11 ] . This poster presents prelim - inary scientometric analysis using data visualization and citation network analysis . The following section briefly overviews postcolonialism , decolo - nialism , postcolonial computing , and decolonial computing . Then , we describe our methods for data collection and analysis . The fol - lowing section presents findings based on our collected corpus . Two main contributions of this poster are ( a ) the creation and char - acterization of a literature corpus on decolonial and postcolonial computing and ( b ) the identification of communities within these domains based on how these papers cite and draw on each other . Finally , we discuss future research directions for connecting decolo - nial and postcolonial discourse within the HCI communities . 2 LITERATURE REVIEW Postcolonialism , as an ideological discipline , emerged from and developed through the works of Edward Said [ 81 ] , Gayatri Spi - vak [ 86 ] , Homi Bhabha [ 13 ] , Dipesh Chakrabarty [ 20 ] – diasporic scholars from the Middle East and South Asia . They , for the most part , refer back to those locations and their imperial interlocutors . Postcolonial scholars study the impacts of colonialism , especially in the cultural realm , and refer to mainly the nineteenth and twentieth 168 CSCW’22 Companion , November 8 – 22 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Taiwan Dipto Das and Bryan Semaan centuries [ 14 ] . On the contrary , decolonial perspective has histori - cally grown out of the works by African and Latin American dias - poric scholars [ 70 ] such as Aimé Césaire [ 19 ] , Frantz Fanon [ 33 , 34 ] , Walter Mignolo [ 63 , 64 ] , Sylvia Wynter [ 95 ] , Anibal Quijano [ 78 ] . Decolonial scholars explore colonialism from the fifteenth century onward , articulating a rejection of racial supremacy of the West over its colonial subjects [ 14 , 70 ] . In the discipline of computing , the phrase “postcolonial comput - ing " was coined in 2010 by Irani and colleagues [ 45 ] . They high - lighted how technology is designed in the West and with Western values , and when it migrates elsewhere and encounters different cultures , it can perpetuate coloniality . Building on their argument , Dourish and Mainwaring described the colonial impulses of ubiqui - tous computing [ 31 ] . In 2014 , Ali introduced the phrase “decolonial computing " [ 4 ] . His later article [ 5 ] re - introduced the phrase in 2016 , which seems to have gained more traction to date . Whereas postcolonial computing researchers have studied how unique local practices emerge around technologies [ 2 , 26 , 44 ] and how tech - nologies work as a medium of imposition of Western standards on the Global South [ 66 , 79 ] , decolonial computing scholars have studied the innovation practices in the Global South that reflect local needs , imagination , and values [ 15 , 23 , 74 , 93 ] . Scholars have argued that gaps exist in how these theoretical frameworks are used in social computing [ 26 ] . This poster investigates whether and how scholarship in these domains is separated . 3 METHODS 3 . 1 Search Strategy and Dataset Preparation We bound the scope of this poster within the published works in the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM ) Digital Library 1 ( ACM DL ) . We identified an initial set of candidate papers using a keyword search within this database . In our query , we were careful of the spelling variations , such as different hyphenating styles ( e . g . , postcolonial and post - colonial ) and North American and British English ( e . g . , colonization and colonisation ) . Our list of keywords included the following terms : Colony , Colonization / Colonisation , Colonize / Colonise , Colonial , Colonialism , Coloniality , Postcolonial / Post - colonial , Postcolonialism / Post - colonialism , Postcoloniality / Post - coloniality , Decolonial , Decolonization / Decolonisation , Decol - onize / Decolonise , Decolonialism , Decoloniality , and Decolonizing / Decolonising . Because of the contemporary and emergent nature of the dis - cussion around decolonial and postcolonial computing in our field , we have included not only full papers but also short papers , work - shop papers , and posters . We also did not put any limits on the publishing date of the papers . Many of these articles use postcolo - nial or decolonial computing as a tangential idea and not as the paper’s primary focus ( e . g . , mentioning the term ( s ) nominally in the discussion section ) . As a scoping strategy , we argue that any term related to decolonization or postcolonialism appearing in the abstract indicates the paper centering itself around those concepts of interest . Therefore , we searched so that it retrieves only those papers which mention any of our search terms in their abstracts . Our query for the papers with any of these keywords in the ab - stracts retrieved 757 results on May 25 , 2022 . We collected these 1 https : / / dl . acm . org / papers’ metadata : type ( i . e . , journal article , proceeding article , or book chapter ) , title , authors’ information , DOI , URL , year , abstract , author - defined keywords , venue ( i . e . , journal , book title , conference name ) , and location ( for conferences ) , from ACM DL 2 . A few terms in our keywords list can be confounding because of their use in many other contexts . For example , the term “colony " can appear in the contexts of mushroom colony , pathogen coloniza - tion , and ant colony in bio - informatics or evolutionary computing papers . Hence , using those keywords retrieves a large number of pa - pers that are not related to decolonial and postcolonial computing . Therefore , we excluded the papers that mention terms / phrases like ant / bee / swarm colony , genetic , evolutionary , etc . , in their titles or abstracts to scope the dataset . Again , the papers published in venues traditionally focused on bio - informatics or evolutionary comput - ing venues ( e . g . , GECCO 3 , AAMAS 4 ) or networking and computer systems - focused venues ( e . g . , Middleware 5 , LANC 6 ) , were labeled as non - relevant . For papers published in conferences or journals that seemed more generalized or interdisciplinary , we read through the titles and abstracts to label them relevant or non - relevant . For example , a speculative article [ 55 ] published in Communications of the ACM used the term “colonize " in the context of colonization of galaxies . Thus , we determined that the relationship of this paper to decolonial and postcolonial literature was distant ; hence , we labeled it as non - relevant . The first author labeled the relevance of the data . In case of confusion , he consulted with the second author to reach a “negotiated agreement " [ 38 ] about the relevance of a particular paper . After filtering , our final dataset contained 115 papers . We also collected citation data from OpenCitations 7 for each paper in our corpus . 3 . 2 Data Analysis In this study , we used a scientometric approach – looking at the quantitative features and characteristics of scientific research . After doing basic data wrangling using Python , we used data visualization to understand the evolution of the number of papers on decolonial and postcolonial computing over the years and identify popular publication venues for such studies . Based on the citation data , we constructed a citation network considering each paper as a node , identified with its DOI . A directed edge between two nodes represents their citation relation : from a cited paper ( Source ) to a paper citing the former ( Target ) . Since in this poster , we are only interested in papers published in ACM DL , we did not include papers from other publishers while constructing the network . We used Gephi [ 12 ] and NetworkX [ 40 ] for network visualization and analysis . 3 . 3 Limitation Prior studies have highlighted that researchers’ backgrounds can influence the decision - making about the relevance of data with the context of studies [ 25 ] . The authors’ academic training and research experience in human - computer interaction and social computing 2 The dataset is publicly available here : shorturl . at / agHW7 3 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference 4 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems 5 ACM / IFIP International Middleware Conference 6 Latin American Networking Conference 7 https : / / opencitations . net / 169 Decolonial and Postcolonial Computing Research CSCW’22 Companion , November 8 – 22 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Taiwan have influenced the papers’ data relevance labeling , thus forming the final dataset . Again , the decision of only considering the papers published in ACM DL might be disadvantaging for scholars from the margins , who do not publish at ACM conferences for financial reasons [ 54 , 57 ] . Moreover , research in decolonial and postcolonial computing can be of interest across a wide range of conferences and journals . Therefore , future works should consider databases of other publishers like IEEE , Elsevier , and Springer . Even within the ACM conferences , papers published at local conferences com - pared to our celebrated venues ( e . g . , CHI , CSCW ) often are subject to discriminatory citational politics – not being cited despite their relevance [ 32 , 54 ] . Thus , citation network analysis might be unable to place such papers in the same communities as other relevant publications . 4 RESULTS 4 . 1 Characterizing the Corpus Within our corpus , CHI was the venue where decolonial and post - colonial computing research papers were published most frequently , with 30 publications ( see Figure 1 ( a ) ) . Other venues with multiple publications were : PDC ( 9 ) , PACM ( 8 ) , ICTD ( 5 ) , XRDS ( 5 ) , CSCW ( 4 ) , AfriCHI ( 4 ) , SIGGRAPH ( 3 ) , DIS ( 3 ) , ICLS ( 3 ) , AIES ( 3 ) , ASIST ( 2 ) , FAccT ( 2 ) , Interactions ( 2 ) , JCDL ( 2 ) , SIGDOC ( 2 ) , UbiComp ( 2 ) , and iConference ( 2 ) . Besides , at least one paper on postcolonial and decolonial computing appeared at venues such as TEI , UIST , and WWW . In Figure 1 ( b ) , the green dashed line shows the year when Irani and colleagues [ 45 ] introduced the term postcolonial comput - ing , and the purple dashed line shows the year when Ali [ 4 ] coined the phrase decolonial computing . We can see a significant uptick in the number of papers after 2014 , suggesting that decolonial and postcolonial computing are emerging fields of study in HCI . Our dataset included the author defined keywords , when those were available . We tried to visualize those as word cloud in Fig - ure 2 ( a ) . Dominance of the terms like decolonization and design shows the focus of decolonial and postcolonial computing liter - ature . Again , keywords like ICTD and HCI4D being highlighted shows us the communities within HCI and social computing from where most of the papers in our corpus are coming . We are also interested to see what words appear frequently in the abstracts of the papers in our corpus . As a preprocessing step , we removed the common English stopwords ( e . g . , prepositions , articles ) and field - specific stopwords ( e . g . , research , paper ) from the abstracts . Figure 2 ( b ) shows the resulting word cloud based on all abstracts in our corpus . Here , the enlarged words such as design , practice , experience , and development show that postcolonial and decolo - nial computing theoretical framing to be particularly helpful for studying the practice and experience of different communities and impactful in design and development research . 4 . 2 Identifying Communities in Corpus While doing citation network analysis , we hypothesize that the papers using postcolonialism as their theoretical thrust mention terms like postcolonial , postcolonialism , postcoloniality in the ab - stracts . The corresponding nodes are colored green . The nodes representing decolonial computing papers , i . e . , whose abstracts mention decolonial , decolonize , decoloniality , are colored in purple . Blue nodes represent the papers that mention words from both groups in abstracts . Corresponding nodes for the papers with ab - stracts not mentioning words related to either of the two theoretical domains are orange in color . These nodes might have been included in the network because they contain other keywords from our list ( e . g . , colonial , colonization ) in their abstracts or have cited postcolo - nial or decolonial computing papers . Figure 3 presents the network using Fruchterman - Reingold layout [ 37 ] , where the sizes of nodes represent the out - degrees , i . e . , the citation counts of the papers within our corpus . There are 62 components in this disconnected network . Top three papers with the highest degree centrality [ 71 ] are : “Postcolonial computing : a lens on design and development " [ 45 ] , “Ubicomp’s colonial impulse " [ 31 ] , and “A brief introduction to decolonial computing " [ 5 ] . The network’s modularity = 0 . 45 ( using Louvain algorithm [ 17 ] ) indicates a community structure [ 35 ] . We identified 66 communities within the network . Among those , 61 have only one item each . Rest five communities comprising multiple papers are intriguing for understanding how different communities have emerged within the decolonial and postcolonial computing research field . These five multi - paper communities are ( A ) [ 2 , 3 , 10 , 21 , 44 , 45 , 47 , 48 , 58 , 65 , 66 , 68 , 85 , 87 , 88 ] , ( B ) [ 7 , 9 , 16 , 31 , 41 – 43 , 46 , 50 , 61 , 69 , 77 , 93 , 94 ] , ( C ) [ 23 , 27 , 49 , 62 , 76 , 90 ] , ( D ) [ 6 , 8 , 18 , 22 , 36 , 60 , 72 , 84 , 91 , 92 ] , and ( E ) [ 5 , 24 , 29 , 30 , 39 , 52 , 56 , 83 , 89 ] . For easier comprehension , we list the titles of the papers within communities in Table 1 in the appendix . Looking at the papers under each community , we can identify patterns in their titles , abstracts , research sites , theoretical frame - works , objectives , author’ affiliations and collaborations , and publi - cation venues . For example , the papers under community - C focus on design which is evidenced through the dominance of terms like “participatory " [ 23 , 49 , 62 ] , “design " [ 23 , 27 , 62 ] , “probing " [ 90 ] in their titles and abstracts and their appearances at design ori - ented conferences like PDC [ 23 , 62 , 90 ] , DIS [ 49 ] , and SIGDOC [ 76 ] . community - D comprises mostly theoretical papers ( e . g . , on pluriver - sality [ 18 , 84 ] ) strongly associated with decolonial computing and decoloniality at large . These papers have articulated decolonial intentions , motives , or views in various spaces such as focusing on HCI education [ 92 ] , research [ 6 , 8 , 36 ] , learning spaces [ 91 ] , etc . In contrast , most papers in community - E present empirical studies in various contexts and topics such as online platform mod - eration [ 24 , 29 ] , education [ 39 , 56 ] , and health care [ 89 ] . As these studies mostly adopted the decolonial computing perspective , the same community also included Ali’s well - cited article on decolonial computing [ 5 ] . We also found that studies conducted in similar research populations got placed under the same communities dur - ing our network analysis . For example , out of 14 papers under community - B , six studies were conducted in African countries ( e . g . , Kenya [ 93 , 94 ] , Zambia [ 94 ] , Rwanda [ 43 ] , South Africa [ 77 ] ) , and nine out of 15 papers under community - A chose South Asian countries ( e . g . , Bangladesh [ 2 , 44 ] , India [ 21 , 47 ] ) as their research sites . The foundational work by Irani and colleagues [ 45 ] exists in community - A in which the empirical studies [ 2 , 44 , 66 , 87 ] heavily drew on this theoretical framework . Similar to South Asian scholars’ instrumental roles in developing postcolonialism , it is interesting to see that most of these studies in the South Asian context used post - colonial computing as their theoretical lens . We also observed high 170 CSCW’22 Companion , November 8 – 22 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Taiwan Dipto Das and Bryan Semaan ( a ) ( b ) Figure 1 : Number of papers in our corpus ( a ) at different venues ( b ) by year ( number of papers in 2022 , circled with blue dashed line , shows the count until the date of data collection ) .

Figure 3 : Citation network of papers in our corpus . intra - community similarity and inter - community dissimilarity , for example , particular authors and affiliations appearing dominantly in one particular community and being less visible in others ( e . g . , a large number of papers from the same affiliation [ 2 , 21 , 48 ] in community - A ) . 5 DISCUSSION While adopting decolonial and postcolonial computing perspec - tives to study different contexts , scholars’ questions revolve around power , authority , participation , and intelligibility of technology . Despite being closely related , our scientometric analysis shows that the scholarship in these areas is disconnected and divided into communities based on their adoption of theoretical frameworks ( e . g . , decolonial and postcolonial ) , contribution ( e . g . , empirical , de - sign , theoretical ) , and authors’ affiliation and collaboration . While postcolonial computing simultaneously explains the coloniality of technology [ 31 , 45 ] and the agency of users [ 53 , 82 ] , decolonial computing aims to imagine and create technology reflecting indige - nous perspectives [ 5 , 75 ] . In our future work , we will develop a framework to connect decolonial and postcolonial discourses in HCI and social computing through a qualitative SLR .
