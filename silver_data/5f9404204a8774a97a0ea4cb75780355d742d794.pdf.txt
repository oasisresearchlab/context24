Peden 1 , 7 , 8 , * SUMMARY The prevalence and strength of serological responses mounted toward SARS - CoV - 2 proteins other than nucleocapsid ( N ) and spike ( S ) , which may be of use as additional serological markers , remains underexplored . Using high - content mi - croscopy to assess antibody responses against full - length StrepTagged SARS - CoV - 2 proteins , we found that 85 % ( 166 / 196 ) of unvaccinated individuals with RT - PCR conﬁrmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections and 74 % ( 31 / 42 ) of individuals infected after being vaccinated developed detectable IgG against the structural protein M , which is higher than previous estimates . Compared with N antibodies , M IgG dis - played a shallower time - dependent decay and greater speciﬁcity . Sensitivity for SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence was enhanced when N and M IgG detection was com - bined . These ﬁndings indicate that screening for M seroconversion may be a good approach for detecting additional vaccine breakthrough infections and highlight the potential to use HCM as a rapidly deployable method to identify the most immunogenic targets of newly emergent pathogens . INTRODUCTION Controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infections within communities and across populations requires accurate knowledge of both current and previous SARS - CoV - 2 infections . Serological assays fulﬁll critical roles toward the latter , identifying individuals previously exposed to the vi - rus who may potentially be immune , while also contributing toward the construction of accurate epidemi - ological estimates of infection rates using serosurveys . Analysis of COVID - 19 patient serum obtained through serological sampling has also provided invaluable information on the kinetics and proﬁle of anti - body responses produced against SARS - CoV - 2 in relation to disease outcomes . 1 – 3 To date , serological testing for SARS - CoV - 2 relies upon detection of antibodies against either the nucle - ocapsid ( N ) or spike ( S ) proteins as both induce detectable humoral immune responses in the vast majority of those infected . 4 Given its relative simplicity and high sensitivity , ELISA - based screening for reactivity of patient sera against puriﬁed versions of the N and S proteins is widely employed and is considered the gold standard for identiﬁcation of patients who have previously been infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . 5 , 6 However , the production of puriﬁed proteins for use in an ELISA can be costly and time consuming , with this same requirement also limiting the ability to assess antibody responses against other SARS - CoV - 2 proteins whose physiochemical properties may be incompatible with production in a puriﬁed form . In combination with immunoﬂuorescence microscopy or ﬂow cytometry , the use of mammalian cells as ve - hicles to express and present viral antigens to screen patient sera for antibodies can bypass the need for puriﬁed proteins and provide additional advantages over ELISA - based serological testing . Viral proteins can be easily transfected into mammalian cells 7 , 8 and once expressed are then produced in a state which incorporates many features that form important parts of epitopes recognized by circulating antibodies , such as posttranslational modiﬁcations . 9 , 10 Screening of serum samples by immunoﬂuorescence 1 School of Bioscience , University of Shefﬁeld , Western Bank , Shefﬁeld S10 2TN , UK 2 Department of Infection , Immunity and Cardiovascular Diseases , University of Shefﬁeld Medical School , Beech Hill Road , Shefﬁeld S10 2RX , UK 3 Department of Pathology , University of Cambridge , Cambridge CB2 1QP , UK 4 Department of Pathology , Emory University , Whitehead Building , Atlanta , GA , USA 5 South Yorkshire Regional Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine , Shefﬁeld Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , Glossop Road , Shefﬁeld S10 2JF , UK 6 WellcomeCentreforHumanGenetics , Nufﬁeld Department of Medicine , University of Oxford , Oxford OX3 7BN , UK 7 Theses authors contributed equally 8 Lead contact * Correspondence : daniel . williams @ shefﬁeld . ac . uk ( D .

Calibration of our automated system using StrepTagged SARS - CoV - 2 N and S proteins demonstrated that automated immu - noﬂuorescence - based antibody screening could detect N and S antibodies in sera collected from patients with COVID - 19 with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity . Most interestingly , further application of this system identiﬁed antibodies against the SARS - CoV - 2 membrane ( M ) protein in a signiﬁcant number of RT - PCR - conﬁrmed SARS - CoV - 2 - positive cases , including in individuals infected following vaccination . By tracking N , S , and M IgG levels measured at multiple time points post infection in the same individuals , we go on to characterize the kinetics of the anti - M antibody response relative to N and ﬁnd that M IgG can in some cases be more durable than N IgG which wanes rapidly following COVID - 19 . RESULTS Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies using immunoﬂuorescence microscopy To test the effectiveness of immunoﬂuorescence microscopy to detect antibodies against speciﬁc SARS - CoV - 2 proteins in human plasma samples ( Figures 1A and 1B ) , we transfected HEK - 293T cells with codon - optimized plasmids encoding StrepTagged SARS - CoV - 2 N and S ( Figures 1C and 1F ) . Based on re - ports of antibody responses directed toward other coronavirus M proteins , 19 – 26 we transfected cells with a StrepTagged SARS - CoV - 2 M construct to determine if SARS - CoV - 2 - infected individuals also develop an - tibodies to M ( Figure 1I ) . Following transfection , we performed a standard immunoﬂuorescence labeling protocol with plasma obtained prior to the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic ( pre - pandemic negative control sam - ples ) or from individuals conﬁrmed to have been infected with SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR . The amount of ﬂuo - rescent signal was quantiﬁed using ImageJ and a ratio between the non - transfected and transfected cells was calculated . As expected , the pre - pandemic samples produced IgG ratios close to 1 . 0 indicating low levels of cross - reactivity with the SARS - CoV - 2 proteins . However , the samples collected from PCR - positive individuals showed IgG ratios greater than 1 . 0 indicating the presence of antibodies to the N and S proteins ( Figures 1D and 1G ) . In addition , many samples also had detectable levels of IgG against the SARS - CoV - 2 M protein ( Figure 1J ) . In support of these observations , similar trends could be seen among ELISA read - ings , immunoblotting signals of N , and immunoﬂuorescence IgG ratios ( Figures 1E , 1H , and S2A – S2C ) . These results conﬁrm that the combined use of transiently expressed tagged SARS - CoV - 2 proteins with immunoﬂuorescence microscopy is a viable approach to detect antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 antigens without the need for puriﬁed viral proteins . An automated microscopy pipeline can be used to quantify the levels of antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 proteins To enhance the throughput of serological testing by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy , we used a high - con - tent microscope in conjunction with automated image analysis software ( HCM ) ( Figures S3A – S3D ) and repeated the experiments shown in Figure 1 using HCM . IgG ratios calculated automatically from images captured by HCM were comparable to those generated through manual quantiﬁcation of the same samples ( Figures S3E – S3G ) , demonstrating that the automated image capture and analysis workﬂow can accurately identify and quantify bound human IgG in plasma from SARS - CoV - 2 - infected individuals . To further test theplatformandcompareitsperformancetoELISA , weanalyzedNandSIgGlevelsin258samplescontaining plasma from62individuals acquiredpriortotheSARS - CoV - 2 pandemic ( pre - pandemicnegativecontrols ) and 196 patients conﬁrmed to have been infected with SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR . Using HCM , we observed a statistically signiﬁcant difference in signal intensity for N and S antibodies between pre - pandemic and SARS - CoV - 2 - positive samples ( Figures 2A and 2C ) . As previously reported , 27 we found that IgG levels were signiﬁcantly elevated for N and S in patients hospitalized after SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( inpatient ) compared to non - hospitalized individuals ( outpatient ) , with these trends also seen in ELISA absorbances for the sample sets ( Figures S4A , S4B , S4E , and S4F ) . ELISA - based detection of N or S IgG in SARS - CoV - 2 - positive samples had marginally higher sensitivity than HCM when speciﬁcity was ﬁxed at 100 % ( Figure 2B , N ELISA ( 185 / 196 , 94 . 4 % ) vs .

To investigate cross - reactivity of SARS - CoV - 2 N with antibodies induced by exposure to seasonal coronaviruses ( H - CoVs ) , a small number of samples taken from patients infected with seasonal H - CoVs ( H1 - H6 ) were incubated with cells expressing StrepTagged SARS - CoV - 2 N ( F ) . One sample ( H3 , highlighted with an asterix ) had IgG signal to N which was above the threshold . Inset in ( F ) shows representative images for this sample . Scale bar = 5 m m .

Samples ll OPEN ACCESS 4 iScience 26 , 107056 , July 21 , 2023 iScience Article a high level of speciﬁcity and sensitivity in detection of both SARS - CoV - 2 Nand S IgG , albeit slightly below the sensitivity provided by ELISA - based N and S testing . HCM reveals a signiﬁcant proportion of patients with COVID - 19 have IgG against the SARS - CoV - 2 M protein As a high percentage of SARS - CoV - 2 - infected samples in our training set had antibodies against the SARS - CoV - 2 M protein , we also tested our larger sample set to further characterize the prevalence of anti - M anti - body responses . As suggested from our pilot experiments , we observed a signiﬁcant difference in anti - M signal intensity between the pre - pandemic SARS - CoV - 2 negative samples and samples from RT - PCR - conﬁrmed SARS - CoV - 2 - positive individuals ( Figure 2E ) . Similar to N and S , our automated platform de - tected higher M antibody levels in COVID - 19 inpatients ( Figure S4I , Tables S1 and S2 ) . ROC curve analysis of the above results ( Figure S4J ) established an optimal IgG ratio threshold of 1 . 36 for classiﬁcation of M IgG ratios as positive or negative , providing 100 % speciﬁcity and 84 . 7 % ( 166 / 196 ) sensitivity . The percent - age of samples with M IgG responses detected by HCM is higher than could be inferred from other recent studies 21 , 22 , 26 and suggests M may be of use as a high - prevalence serological marker of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Detecting M can help reduce the number of false positives detected by N - based serological assays While establishing our serological platform , we found multiple instances of above threshold N IgG signal in pre - pandemic plasma samples , including some that were collected from individuals with RT - PCR - conﬁrmed seasonal human coronavirus infections ( Figures 2F – 2H ) . Each of these samples contained no detectable antibodies against either SARS - CoV - 2 S or M ( Figures 2G , 2H , S5A , and S5B ) . Consistent with the results seen by HCM , several of the pre - pandemic samples positive for N IgG by HCM also registered high ELISA readings ( Figure S5C ) . This above threshold signal is likely caused by cross - reactivity of anti - bodies induced by exposure to the N protein of other coronaviruses with SARS - CoV - 2 N and is consistent with high signal in negative control sera observed in other published results when testing for SARS - CoV - 2 N antibodies . 4 , 28 Combined use of N and M antibody testing boosts the sensitivity of HCM and ELISA - based serological testing Given the high prevalence of antibody responses to M observed by HCM , we examined whether the com - bined detection of antibodies to N and M could boost the sensitivity of SARS - CoV - 2 serological testing in cases where S cannot be used to conﬁrm prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection , such as after vaccination . Five of 14 RT - PCR - conﬁrmed SARS - CoV - 2 - positive samples that were N IgG negative by HCM had detectable M an - tibodies ( Figure 2I ) . Three of these samples had sub - threshold N ELISA absorbances and were therefore also misclassiﬁed as SARS - CoV - 2 negative by ELISA . Supplementing SARS - CoV - 2 serological testing with screening for M antibodies by HCM therefore increased the number of detectable SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tions from 185 / 196 ( 94 . 4 % ) when using an N - based ELISA by itself , to 187 / 196 ( 95 . 4 % ) with combined testing for M IgG alongside N ( Tables S3 and S4 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 M antibody kinetics contribute to enhanced serological sensitivity at later time points post infection As N antibody levels have been reported to wane quickly after SARS - CoV - 2 infection , 29 – 31 we measured N and M IgG levels in plasma collected from individuals at multiple time points after SARS - CoV - 2 infection , to establish whether M may be a better long - term marker of infection relative to N . While the sensitivity of serological testing using N antibodies as a marker remained higher than M at all time points we tested ( Fig - ure 3A ) , M antibody levels on average displayed a shallower time - dependent decline ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . Screening for M IgG in samples collected between 500 and 600 days post infection increased the number of detectable SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc IgG responses from 80 % using N alone ( 12 / 15 positive ) to 86 . 7 % when Figure 2 .

To assess M IgG responses relative to N in cases of breakthrough infection , N and M IgG levels were analyzed by HCM in 42 serum samples collected from individuals infected with SARS - CoV - 2 after being vaccinated ( Sample collection range : 10 and 80 days post infection , median collection time point : 29 days post infection ) .

Further samples had detectable anti - M antibodies at 281 and 336 days after infection when no N IgG was detected ( Figure 3A ) . SARS - CoV - 2 M antibodies are a valuable serological marker of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vaccinated individuals We investigated the utility of M relative to N as a marker of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in 42 cases of infection in vaccinated individuals , collected between July 2021 and June 2022 , therefore likely representing a mix of SARS - CoV - 2 Delta and Omicron variant infections . The median time from positive RT - PCR to sampling was 29 days ( interquartile range 21 days – 33 days ) . Using HCM , antibodies to N could be detected in 76 . 2 % ( 32 / 42 ) of all post - infection samples , with anti - M antibodies detected in 73 . 8 % ( 31 / 42 ) . The majority of samples analyzed were positive for both N and M IgG ( 71 . 5 % , 30 / 42 ) ( Figure S6A ) ; however , as described for primary infections in unvaccinated individuals ( Figure 2I ) , a number of samples were N IgG positive , M IgG negative ( 4 . 76 % , 2 / 42 ) or N IgG negative , and M IgG positive ( 4 . 76 % , 2 / 42 ) ( Figures 3D – 3G ) . As a result , the number of samples with detectable SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc IgG increased from 76 . 2 % or 73 . 8 % using N or M alone , respec - tively , to 78 . 6 % ( 33 / 42 ) by testing for both M and N IgG ( Figure 3H ) . 71 . 4 % ( 30 / 42 ) of participants also had ev - idence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection prior to vaccination ( classiﬁed as previously infected ) , whereas 28 . 6 % ( 12 / 42 ) were infection naive prior to the post - vaccine infection . Average IgG ratios for both Nand M were signiﬁcantly lower in previously naive healthcare workers than those in previously infected individuals ( Figures S6B and S6C ) . Antibodies against N or M were detectable in only 33 . 3 % ( 4 / 12 ) and 25 % ( 3 / 12 ) of previously naive in - dividuals , respectively , compared with 87 % ( 26 / 30 ) for N and 90 % ( 27 / 30 ) for M in previously infected health - care workers , demonstrating the boost to previously primed N and M antibody responses ( Figure S6D ) . How - ever , combined testing for M IgG alongside N in samples from previously naive individuals again increased the percentage of samples with detectable N - or M - speciﬁc antibodies to 41 . 7 % ( 5 / 12 ) ( Figure S6D ) . Finally , we performed an analysis of antibody levels over time for N and M following infections in vaccinated individuals . Antibodies against N or M in previously naive individuals were close to or below threshold at all time points analyzed ( Figures 3I , S7A , and S8 ) . In contrast , average N and M antibody levels were above threshold at all time points in previously infected participants , peaking in samples collected between 36 and 45 days post infection , before generally undergoing a decline in samples collected after 45 days post infection ( Figures 3I and S7B ) . The kinetics of anti - N and anti - M waning following infection in vacci - nated individuals appeared to differ from the patterns observed following primary infections in unvacci - nated individuals , with a more pronounced drop in levels after 50 days seen when infection occurred after vaccination ( Figures 3B and S7C ) . This would suggest that following SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vaccinated individuals , N and M IgG levels may wane quicker . However , for samples from previously infected individ - uals collected between 56 and 100 days post infection , a greater number could be classiﬁed as SARS - CoV - 2 positive when using M IgG ratios instead of N ( M : 50 % ( 2 / 4 ) , N : 25 % ( 1 / 4 ) ) ( Figures 3J and S7B ) . Similar to the results described in Figures 3A – 3C , M IgG after breakthrough infection may in some instances be sustained above the detectable threshold for longer than N IgG levels , thereby helping to detect additional SARS - CoV - 2 infections . This sustained M response was evident in a number of previously infected patient IgG proﬁles where N IgG levels increased after infection before declining while M IgG levels at the same time points increased or remained constant ( Figures 3G and S9 - Proﬁles 1 , 7 , 12 , and 16 ) .

Although the high - throughput , semi - quan - titative method we present here is an upgrade on previous immunoﬂuorescence - based serological screening methods , which have largely involved low - throughput qualitative assessment of antibody ti - ters , 15 , 32 , 33 manual inspection and scoring of captured images for detectable pathogen - speciﬁc antibodies remains a beneﬁt of serological screening by HCM over other cell - based platforms such as ﬂow cytometry . In addition , seeding of cell populations expressing viral proteins with distinct tags ( i . e . M - FLAG expressing cells seeded with N - StrepTag expressing cells ) in the same well can allow antibody levels against different proteins to be examined simultaneously in the same patient serum incubation , a beneﬁt unique to cell - based screening platforms ( Figure S10 ) . As demonstrated here , the deployment of an HCM - based platform to screen patient sera on a large scale is feasible ; however , there are drawbacks to this system compared to ELISA - based approaches . HCM re - quires equipment to culture cells under sterile conditions and access to high - content microscopes which may not be available in low - to middle - income countries . We suggest that HCM - based serological screening would be of most value as a pandemic preparedness tool which would be used during the early stages of any future pandemic . The ability to rapidly identify the most antigenic components of a newly emergent pathogen would be extremely useful and could aid both in vaccine development and to help guide the selection of antigens for use in serological assays . As part of this study , we initially took this approach and screened the whole proteome of SARS - CoV - 2 look - ing for other serological targets in addition to N and S ( data not shown ) . We only observed a strong serological response to the M protein which is consistent with other reports using cell - based systems . 21 Interestingly , it has been reported that antibodies to multiple SARS - CoV - 2 non - structural and accessory proteins can reproducibly be detected using other methods . 26 , 34 – 36 At present , it is unclear why we fail to detect immunoreactivity to these proteins when they are expressed in cells . It is possible that immuno - ﬂuorescence based detection of patient antibodies is not sensitive enough to detect the lower levels of an - tibodies produced against these proteins . Thus , we focused our attention on exploring the utility of the M protein for serological studies using HCM . Recent studies investigating serum reactivity to the structural proteins of SARS - CoV - 2 by ﬂow cytometry have found that approximately 50 % – 60 % of patients with COVID - 19 contained antibodies against the SARS - CoV - 2 M protein . 21 , 22 , 24 In a further study using a biotinylated M peptide as antibody bait , SARS - CoV - 2 M antibodies could be detected with 100 % speciﬁcity in 62 . 3 % ( 71 / 114 ) of patient serum samples at 3 months post infection . 23 Our results indicate that SARS - CoV - 2 M antibodies may be of even higher prevalence than previously appreciated as we could detect M antibody signal in close to 85 % of PCR - vali - dated SARS - CoV - 2 - positive samples . The higher seroprevalence observed in this study may be due to the fact that we are using the full - length M protein rather than just a short peptide ( ELISA ) 22 , 23 or the surface - exposed portion of the protein ( ﬂow cytometry ) . 21 These methods would only pick up antibodies targeting the extracellular region of M . In contrast , our assay will detect antibodies targeting both extracellular and intracellular regions of M . The higher seroprevalence of patients with M antibodies seen using HCM sug - gests that a signiﬁcant portion of antibodies induced against M target intracellular portions of the M pro - tein . Including these regions in antigens used in M immunoassays may therefore help to further enhance the sensitivity of serological testing against M . The high seroprevalence of M antibodies in SARS - CoV - 2 - infected patients suggests that testing for M IgG may be of value to SARS - CoV - 2 serology . The utility of M is underscored by complications associated with testing using N and S . The use of the S protein in vaccination programs means detection of S antibodies can no longer be used as an indicator of prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vaccinated individuals who are subse - quently infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . In addition , vaccinations combining N and S as immunogens to confer sterilizing immunity have also been proposed and tested 37 which would preclude N - and S - based testing . A further complication relates to the speciﬁcity of IgG responses detected toward the SARS - CoV - 2 N protein . Similar to other studies , 4 , 28 , 38 we found here that 11 % of pre - pandemic samples contained antibodies that cross - reacted with SARS - CoV - 2 N but not S or M . Finally , rapid waning of N antibody levels may limit the use of N as a serological marker of SARS - CoV - 2 infection at longer time points after infection . 29 – 31 ll OPEN ACCESS 8 iScience 26 , 107056 , July 21 , 2023 iScience Article Our characterization of the SARS - CoV - 2 M IgG response suggests that M possesses many characteristics that would complement serological testing using N . First , most N - positive samples were also positive for M and , in addition , a number of samples with low or undetectable N IgG could be unambiguously classiﬁed as SARS - CoV - 2 positive when screening for infection using M . Second , despite the high degree of sequence similarity between M proteins of different coronaviruses , we observed no instances of serum cross - reac - tivity from our pre - pandemic ( 0 / 62 ) or seasonal coronavirus ( 0 / 6 ) sample sets with SARS - CoV - 2 M , suggest - ing that serological testing using M may provide higher speciﬁcity than N . Third , M IgG often exhibited a shallower time - dependent decline than N . Longitudinal assessment of M antibody levels has indicated that M IgG remains stable and is detectable at 12 months post infection ; 22 , 23 however , a direct comparison with N antibody levels in the same samples over time has to our knowledge not been performed . Our results support the observations of previous studies , 22 , 23 even showing that in many samples M IgG is detectable beyond 12 months post infection , and provide the ﬁrst high resolution temporal proﬁles from individual patients of the SARS - CoV - 2 M IgG response relative to N . These proﬁles highlighted instances where at later time points post infection M IgG levels remained stable and detectable while N IgG was undetectable or declining toward the detection threshold . Finally , all the above characteristics were largely mirrored in cases of infection in SARS - CoV - 2 - vaccinated individuals , particularly in participants with a prior history of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , demonstrating the boosting of previously primed anti - N and M responses . We found vaccinated individuals with no prior history of SARS - CoV - 2 infection rarely developed a detectable IgG response against N or M after a post vaccination SARS - CoV - 2 infection , which is consistent with pre - vious studies for N . 23 , 39 , 40 Combined testing of patient sera against both antigens provided an increase in the number of samples with a detectable SARS - CoV - 2 - speciﬁc IgG response , however , again highlighting the advantages of dual N and M serological testing . For the above reasons , we propose that testing for M IgG by HCM or other means could in future be used to enhance the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of SARS - CoV - 2 serological testing in both vaccinated and unvaccinated SARS - CoV - 2 - infected individuals . Recent struc - tural studies of SARS - CoV - 2 M have shown that it is feasible to make large quantities of a puriﬁed full - length M protein , 41 , 42 suggesting it may be possible to develop an M ELISA which could be used for large - scale serological studies . Limitations of the study Although this manuscript highlights the potential to use SARS - CoV - 2 M IgG as a third high seroprevalence marker of infection , this is likely dependent on assaying against a full - length M protein as methods using extracellular regions of M to assay for M antibodies display lower sensitivity . 21 , 23 As the use of a high - con - tent microscope may not always be available , widespread use of M alongside N and S as part of ELISA - based sero - panels would be greatly facilitated by the ready availability of a puriﬁed full - length M protein . The production of a soluble full - length M protein for use in an ELISA was not addressed as part of this work but , as mentioned earlier , is likely to be possible given the success of other groups in producing a puriﬁed full - length M protein for use in structural studies . 41 , 42 Additionally , while we speculate that the higher sensitivity of HCM - based anti - M testing is due to the ability of our HCM - based method to detect antibodies targeting the intracellular and extracellular regions of M , we did not test this hypothesis . It would therefore be of interest to examine whether the higher sensitivity of anti - M testing observed here is indeed due to a signiﬁcant proportion of antibodies against M targeting intra - virion regions of the M protein . This would provide further evidence in favor of using a full - length M protein in serological studies . The low numbers of samples used ( 42 serum samples ) as part of this work examining the M antibody response following SARS - CoV - 2 infection of vaccinated individuals is also a potential limitation . While this is to our knowledge the largest sample set from individuals with a breakthrough infection tested for an M antibody response , the conclusions drawn from this analysis would be boosted by testing an even larger number of serum samples obtained from individuals with a breakthrough infection . This may now be possible given a greater percentage of the population have now been vaccinated and likely subse - quently infected with SARS - CoV - 2 .

EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS Recruitment and consent Plasma samples used were from healthcare workers ( HCWs ) recruited at Shefﬁeld Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust ( STH ) as part of the COVID - 19 Humoral Immune Responses in front - line healthcare workers ( HCWs ) study ( HERO ) , sampled in May and June 2020 . 27 Further longitudinal plasma samples from HCWs were used from a prospective , observational , cohort study ( PITCH ) , where in Shefﬁeld , partic - ipants were recruited under the Shefﬁeld Teaching Hospitals ( STH ) Observational Study of Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension , Cardiovascular Disease and other Respiratory Disease ( STH - Obs ) . 44 , 45 Regulato - ry approval was provided by HRA and Health and Care Research Wales ( HERO - 20 / HRA / 2180 ) , and the Yorkshire and Humber – Shefﬁeld Research Ethics Committee ( STHObs - 18 / YH / 0441 ) . Anonymised plasma samples from hospitalised COVID - 19 patients ( collected during February to May 2020 ) and plasma collected before 2017 during routine clinical care were used for assay validation purposes with approval from the STH R & D ofﬁce as per standard practice . Plasma samples used for analysis of N and M antibody levels after infections in vaccinated individuals were obtained between July 2021 and June 2022 . Cell culture and transfections HEK - 293T cells ( CRL - 3216 ) originally obtained from ATCC , were grown in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Me - dium ( Merck , D6429 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco , 16140071 ) , 100 IU / ml penicillin , 100 m g / ml streptomycin and 2mM glutamine ( Merck , G1146 - 100ML ) . Cells were cultured at 37 (cid:1) C with 5 % CO 2 in a humidiﬁed incubator .

The next day , plasmid DNA was mixed with transfection reagent ( Fugene HD , E2311 ) at a ratio of 1 m g DNA : 3 m l Fugene and added to cells following a 10 minute incubation as per the manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were left at 37 (cid:1) C overnight before being processed for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . METHOD DETAILS Antibodies and plasmids StrepTagged proteins and human IgG were detected by microscopy using StrepTactin - DY549 ( 1 : 1000 , IBA Lifesciences 2 - 1565 - 050 ) and rabbit anti - human - IgG AlexaFluor - 488 ( 1 : 500 , Life technologies A1101 ) respec - tively . Primary antibodies used for western blotting were mouse anti - SARS - CoV - 2 nucleocapsid ( Genetex , GTX632269 ) , mouse anti - strep - mAb ( 1 : 1000 , IBA lifesciences 2 - 1507 - 001 ) and rabbit anti - GAPDH ( Protein - tech , 60004 - 1 - Ig ) . Secondary antibodies for western blotting were HRP conjugated donkey anti - human IgG ( 1 : 2000 , Biolegend 410902 ) , HRP conjugated anti - mouse ( 1 : 2000 , Jackson Immuno Research 115 - 035 - 008 ) and HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit ( 1 : 2000 , Jackson Immuno Research 111 - 035 - 144 ) . StrepTagged SARS - CoV - 2 N , S and M expression constructs were a kind gift from Professor Nevan Krogan , University of California . All SARS - CoV - 2 proteins were human codon optimised and expressed from pLVX - EF1alpha - IRES - puro ( N and M ) or pTwist - EF1alpha - IRES - puro ( S ) plasmids as previously described . 8 Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy Following transfection , coverslips were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) . Cells were then ﬁxed for 15 minutes at room temperature with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ; Park Scientiﬁc Limited , 04018 - 4 ) in PBS , PFA quenched with 100mM glycine ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , 10070150 ) for 5 minutes and cells permeabi - lised and blocked with 0 . 1 % Saponin ( Sigma , S4521 ) and 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , BP1600 - 100 ) diluted in PBS ( IF buffer ) for 10 minutes . For detection of intracellular proteins ( N and M ) , coverslips were incubated with patient serum diluted at 1 : 125 in 50 m l of IF buffer for 1 hour at room tem - perature . The patient serum was then aspirated , and the coverslips were washed three times using IF buffer . For detection of cell surface S , coverslips were incubated with patient serum ( 1 : 125 in DMEM ) for 1 hour at 37 (cid:1) C prior to ﬁxation . Bound antibodies and StrepTagged viral proteins were detected by incu - bating the coverslips with an anti - human IgG secondary antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor - 488 and StrepTactin - DY549 for 1 hour at room temperature . Cell nuclei were then counterstained with DAPI ( Sigma , D9542 ) , coverslips washed a further 3 times with IF buffer and mounted on microscope slides with Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant ( ThermoFisher scientiﬁc , P36930 ) . Patient samples were imaged using a 20x objective ( Olympus BX61 motorised wide - ﬁeld epiﬂuorescence microscope ) and images collected with a Hamamatsu Orca monochrome camera . Manual quantiﬁcation of immunoﬂuorescence images For manual quantiﬁcation of bound antibodies recognising SARS - CoV - 2 N and S proteins , average 488 - ﬂuorescence intensity was measured in FIJI 43 from a minimum of six non - transfected and six trans - fected cells . Transfected cells were identiﬁed by the StrepTactin 549 staining . A ratio of cell associated ﬂuo - rescence from non - transfected cells compared to transfected cells was obtained by dividing the 488 - intensity measurements from transfected cells with the average 488 - intensity from non - transfected cells . For manual quantiﬁcation of anti - M antibody signal , 488 - signal associated with Golgi localised M identiﬁed by the StrepTag staining was quantiﬁed from a minimum of six transfected cells . For non - trans - fected cells , 488 - signal from the perinuclear region was measured and a ratio calculated as described above . In our initial experiments assaying IgG responses against N , N antibody levels in patient sera were limiting as having too many transfected cells signiﬁcantly reduced the anti - human IgG - 1 Alexa - 488 signal at higher transfected cell densities ( Figure S1 ) . To avoid using larger amounts of patient sera to increase the antibody speciﬁc Alexa - 488 signal , we instead controlled the transfected to non - transfected cell ratio for N , S and M so that non - transfected cells were in excess ( 10 : 1 non transfected : transfected cells ) . Automated high content microscopy and image analysis HEK cells seeded in 6 well plates were transfected with SARS - CoV - 2 plasmid DNA encoding either N , S or M proteins or mock transfected as described above . Cells were detached by rinsing with conditioned ll OPEN ACCESS iScience 26 , 107056 , July 21 , 2023 15 iScience Article medium 24 hours after transfection . Mock transfected cells were mixed with transfected cells before being seeded into a poly - l - lysine coated 96 well plate ( Greiner - bio - one , 655098 ) at a density of 30 , 000 – 40 , 000 cells per well and left to adhere overnight at 37 (cid:1) C . The next day , cells were processed for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy as described above . Images were acquired with a 20x objective on a Molecular Devices Image Xpress Micro high content microscope , col - lecting signal from DAPI , FITC and Texas red channels . A minimum of 4 non overlapping sites per well were imaged . Captured images were analysed using the Molecular Devices Image Xpress Micro software package . Transfected and non - transfected cells were identiﬁed as described in Figure 2 . Total ﬂuorescence signal for each cell identiﬁed by the software was divided by cell area and an average ﬂuorescence intensity for transfected and non - transfected cells calculated from multiple cells per serum sample assayed . Western blotting HEK - 293T cells expressing SARS - CoV - 2 N grown in 6 well dishes were detached by rinsing with conditioned media and cell suspensions collected . Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 minutes and the media then aspirated . Following one wash with PBS , the cell pellet was lysed in sample buffer con - taining 5 % b - mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 minutes at 95 (cid:1) C . Cell lysates were then loaded onto a Tris - Glycine polyacrylamide gel and proteins resolved by SDS - PAGE . Gels were transferred overnight via wet transfer in Tobin buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 192 mM glycine , 20 % Methanol ) onto PVDF membranes ( Cytiva , 10600023 ) before blocking ( PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( Sigma , P7949 ) ( PBST ) , 5 % skim powder milk ( Sigma , 70166 ) ) for 1 hour at room temperature . Membranes were then probed with patient sera diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking solution or an anti - StrepTag monoclonal antibody overnight . Membranes were then washed three times for 5 minutes each with PBST and incubated with donkey anti - human or anti - mouse HRP conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour . Following three 5 - minute PBST washes , membranes were incubated with Clarity Western ECL substrate ( Bio - rad , 170 - 5061 ) and signal detected using a LICOR c - DiGiT imaging system . Quantiﬁcation of western blots was performed using the Image Studio Lite soft - ware package . ELISA ELISA for S and N proteins were performed as previously described . 27 High binding microtiter plates ( either Immulon 4HBX ; Thermo Scientiﬁc , 6405 , or Nunc MaxiSorp ; Thermo Scientiﬁc , 442404 ) were coated over - night at 4 (cid:1) C with 50 m l / well SARS - CoV - 2 protein diluted in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Either full - length spike produced in mammalian cells , 46 or nucleocapsid produced in E . coli were used as antigens . Recombinant nucleocapsid protein was produced as previously described . 27 Once coated , plates were washed 3x with 0 . 05 % PBS - Tween , and blocked for 1 hour with 200 m l / well casein blocking buffer . Plates were emptied ( no wash step ) and loaded with 100 m l / well of samples and controls , diluted to 1 : 200 for a 2 hour incubation . Plates were washed 3x and loaded with 100 m l / well goat anti - human IgG - HRP conjugate ( Invitrogen , 11594230 ) at 1 : 500 dilution for a 1 hour incubation . After a ﬁnal 3x wash , plates were developed with 100 m l / well TMB substrate ( KPL , 5120 - 0074 ) for 10 minutes in the dark . The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 m l / well 1 % HCl stop solution ( KPL , 5150 - 0021 ) . Absorbances were read immediately at 450 nm . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All graphs included in ﬁgures were made using the GraphPad Prism software package . Statistical compar - isons between groups using an unpaired t - test and Pearson correlation coefﬁcient analysis of N , S and M antibody relationships were all performed using GraphPad Prism . All experiments were performed a min - imum of two times . ll OPEN ACCESS 16 iScience 26 , 107056 , July 21 , 2023 iScience Article
