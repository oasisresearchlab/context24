Constriction of actin rings by passive crosslinkers Alexander Cumberworth ∗ and Pieter Rein ten Wolde † AMOLF , Science Park 104 , 1098 XG Amsterdam , Netherlands In many organisms , cell division is driven by the constriction of a cytokinetic ring , which consists of actin filaments and crosslinking proteins . While it has long been believed that the constriction is driven by motor proteins , it has recently been discovered that passive crosslinkers that do not turn over fuel are able to generate enough force to constrict actin filament rings . To study the ring constriction dynamics , we develop a model that includes the driving force of crosslinker condensation and the opposing forces of friction and filament bending . We analyze the constriction force as a function of ring topology and crosslinker concentration , and predict forces that are sufficient to constrict an unadorned plasma membrane . Our model also predicts that actin - filament sliding arises from an interplay between filament rotation and crosslinker hopping , producing frictional forces that are low compared to those of crosslinker - mediated microtubule sliding . In animals , fungi and some closely related unicellular eukaryotes , cytokinesis is driven by the assembly and con - striction of a ring composed of actin filaments and a num - ber of actin - binding proteins [ 1 – 3 ] . It is widely believed that the constriction forces in the ring are generated by myosin , a motor protein that drives the sliding of actin fil - aments along each other in an active process using fuel turnover [ 4 – 10 ] . However , ring constriction and success - ful cell division have been observed with impaired myosin motor activity [ 11 ] , particularly in budding yeast [ 12 – 14 ] . Furthermore , it was recently found that passive crosslinking proteins , which do not turnover fuel , are also able to pro - duce sliding forces , either via the entropy associated with the diffusion of the crosslinkers within the overlap region between the filaments , or via their condensation from the solution to the overlap region [ 15 ] . Even more recently , it has been shown that passive actin crosslinkers can not only induce the assembly of actin filaments into rings , but also even drive the constriction of these rings [ 16 ] . Yet , it re - mains unclear what the magnitude of the constriction force is that can be generated via this mechanism , how this force depends on the concentration of the crosslinkers and the stiffness and configuration of the filaments , and whether these forces would be sufficient to drive cell constriction . Finally , given that microtubule sliding driven by passive crosslinkers rapidly stalls because the friction becomes pro - hibitive [ 15 , 17 ] , it is also unclear how actin rings are able to constrict on experimental timescales [ 16 ] . Here , we develop an analytical model that accounts for the sliding force from passive filament crosslinkers and the opposing forces stemming from the bending of filaments and the friction of sliding . The details of our model are based on the anillin - actin system of Ref . [ 16 ] , although we empha - size that the framework of the model is more generic , apply - ing to any system consisting of filaments that are crosslinked by proteins that passively bind to discrete binding sites . We show under what conditions a ring at equilibrium is possi - ble , and how the force depends on the ring radius for differ - ent filament lengths , topologies , and crosslinker concentra - tions . The force generated by such a ring would be sufficient to constrict an unadorned plasma membrane , and could be of interest for building the division machinery in a mini - mal synthetic cell . Lastly , our model predicts that the fric - tional force scales exponentially with the number of bound crosslinkers , in contrast with the superexponential scaling of crosslinker - mediated microtubule sliding [ 17 ] , allowing for ring constriction on minute timescales [ 16 ] . In order to model the contractile rings , we need an ex - pression for the energy of filament sliding when passive crosslinkers are present . In this case , the sliding force is a condensation force , i . e . the sliding is driven by the bind - ing of more crosslinkers as the overlap increases [ 15 ] . Both Lansky et al . [ 15 ] and Wierenga [ 18 ] derived analytical ex - pressions for a condensation force where the binding and unbinding of the crosslinkers were assumed to be fast rel - ative to filament sliding . Here , as in Ref . [ 18 ] , we assume that the crosslinkers can either bind once to a single fila - ment or to a pair of binding sites , such that they bundle two filaments ( see Supplemental Material [ 19 ] for discussion of anillin - actin bundling ) . If the binding sites are separated by a distance of 𝛿 d , then the overlap length is 𝐿 = 𝛿 d ( 𝑙 − 1 ) , where 𝑙 is the number of binding site pairs ( Fig . 1 ( a ) ) . The free energy is then given by [ 18 ] ∆ Φ S = −𝑘 B 𝑇𝐿 𝛿 d ln ( 1 + 𝜉 ) , 𝜉 = 𝐾 s D 2 [ X ] 𝐾 dD ( 𝐾 sD + [ X ] ) 2 , ( 1 ) where 𝑇 is the temperature , [ X ] is the concentration of anillin , 𝐾 sD is the dissociation constant of anillin binding to a single actin filament , 𝐾 dD is the dissociation constant of anillin crosslinking two actin filaments from solution , and 𝑘 B is Boltzmann’s constant . The linear dependence of ∆ Φ S on 𝐿 means that the sliding force , given by the derivative of Eq . ( 1 ) , does not depend on the overlap length . Because the sliding force is independent of the overlap length , the ring - constriction force depends only on the to - tal number of overlaps , and hence the connectivity of the filaments , or in other words , the topology of the ring . We consider stable rings wherein all filaments are under tension and hence contribute to the constriction force ( i . e . those fil - a r X i v : 2 2 03 . 04260v2 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 1 7 M a r 2023 𝐿 𝛿 s 𝛿 d 𝛿 s 2𝜋 / 13 5 6 1 3 1 2 4 5 6 1 3 1 2 4 scaffold ring 5 6 1 3 1 2 4 filament crosslinker periodic boundary 6 1 3 4 2 5 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 1 .

Fila - ments slide in increments of 𝛿 s , which requires a rotation of 2𝜋 ∕ 13 . ( b ) Diagrams of a ring constricting to half its radius . The 2D dia - grams use periodic boundary conditions . On the left , the ring is at its maximum radius 𝑅 max ; in the middle , it has constricted to three quarters of 𝑅 max ; on the right , it has reached its minimum radius 𝑅 min = 𝑅 max ∕ 2 . In the top right , a 3D representation of the topology diagram in the center is given . For a given 𝑁 f , the topology of the ring is characterized by the “scaffold ring” . In this example , the number of filaments in the scaffold ring 𝑁 sca is 4 , while the total number of filaments 𝑁 f is 6 . Note that the scaffold ring is not unique ; here the minimal set is defined by filaments 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , but it could just as well be defined by 1 , 3 , 5 , and 6 . aments that have overlaps on either end ; see Supplemental Material [ 19 ] for further discussion ) . To characterize the ring topology , we introduce the notion of a “scaffold ring” ( Figs . 1 ( b ) , 2 ( a ) , and S1 ( a ) ) . The scaffold ring is defined by the smallest set of filaments that still form a ring , and 𝑁 sca is defined to be the number of filaments in that ring . Making the simplifying assumption that all filaments have the same length , the number of overlaps in the ring is determined by 𝑁 sca and the total number of filaments in the ring 𝑁 f ( Fig . 1 ( b ) ) . In a scaffold ring , each filament forms two over - laps , making the number of overlaps equal to the number of filaments . However , each additional filament will add two more overlaps to the ring ; the total number of overlaps is thus 𝑁 o = 2𝑁 f − 𝑁 sca . One could envision the scaffold ring as the ring that initially forms , with subsequent binding of filaments leading to rings with 𝑁 f > 𝑁 sca . To derive the total free energy of the ring as a function of the radius , we need an expression for the total overlap length 𝐿 tot as a function of the radius 𝑅 . If we make the further simplifying assumption that all filaments overlap to the same degree , then 𝑁 sca also determines this relation - ship : the length of each overlap 𝐿 is the difference between the filament length 𝐿 f and the current ring circumference divided by 𝑁 sca . Then , the total overlap length is 𝐿 tot = 𝑁 o 𝐿 = ( 2𝑁 f − 𝑁 sca ) ( 𝐿 f − 2𝜋𝑅 𝑁 sca ) . ( 2 ) This expression reveals that the maximum radius 𝑅 max , where 𝐿 tot = 0 , is 𝑅 max = 𝑁 sca 𝐿 f ∕ 2𝜋 . We restrict the mini - mum radius 𝑅 min to be 𝑅 max ∕ 2 because of an energy barrier due to steric clashing that begins to occur at this point as the filaments run into each other , a point we explain in more detail in the Supplementary Material [ 19 ] . The final element in deriving an expression for the con - striction force is an expression for the energy required to bend the filaments into a ring . If we treat the ring as a sim - ple linearly elastic rod , and assume that the ring geometry is perfectly circular ( the full derivation and justifications for these assumptions are given in the Supplemental Mate - rial [ 19 ] ) , then the bending energy is 𝑈 B = 𝑁 f 𝐸𝐼𝐿 f 2𝑅 2 , ( 3 ) where 𝐸 is the Young’s modulus , 𝐼 is the second moment of area , and 𝑅 is the ring radius . Then , multiplying Eq . ( 1 ) by 𝑁 o and combining it with Eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) allows us to write the total free energy , the derivative of which gives the radial constriction force , 𝐹 = −2𝜋𝑘 B 𝑇 ( 2𝑁 f − 𝑁 sca ) 𝑁 sca 𝛿 d ln ( 1 + 𝜉 ) + 𝑁 f 𝐸𝐼𝐿 f 𝑅 3 . ( 4 ) In equilibrium , the sliding force is balanced by the opposing bending force such that the net force 𝐹 is zero ; solving Eq . ( 4 ) for 𝐹 = 0 then yields the equilibrium radius 𝑅 eq . With Eq . ( 4 ) , we can calculate the free energies and con - striction forces as a function of the radius , as well as the equilibrium radius for a given set of parameters . In the study that observed the constricting rings [ 16 ] , it was found that the rings have up to eight filaments , so we focus on this range of filaments here ( see Supplemental Material [ 19 ] for discussion of model parameters ) . At large radii , the sliding force dominates over the bending force , and the net force is negative ( inward ) ( Fig . 2 ) . The free energy and the mag - nitude of the force then decrease as the radius decreases . For radii smaller than 𝑅 eq , the free energy increases and the net force becomes positive ( outward ) , since the bend - ing force becomes larger than the sliding force . As 𝑁 f in - creases for a given 𝑁 sca , 𝑅 eq decreases , but quickly enters the regime of heavily diminishing returns ( Fig . 2 ( a ) ( iii ) ) . From Fig . 2 ( a ) ( iv ) and Eq . ( 4 ) , however , the initial constriction force can be seen to increase linearly with 𝑁 f for a given radius . Finally , for a given 𝑁 f , there is a trade - off between 2 1 3 5 7 2 2 4 4 6 6 8 8 scaffold ring 1 3 5 7 2 4 6 8 0 . 6 0 . 8 𝑅 / µm − 50 0 50 100 Δ Φ / k B 𝑇 𝑁 f = 2 𝑁 f = 8 ( iii ) 𝑁 sca = 2 , 𝐿 f = 3 . 0 µm 0 . 6 0 . 8 𝑅 / µm − 2 0 2 4 𝐹 / p N 𝑁 f = 2 𝑁 f = 8 ( iv ) 𝑁 sca = 2 , 𝐿 f = 3 . 0 µm 0 . 5 1 . 0 𝑅 / µm 0 500 Δ Φ / k B 𝑇 𝐿 f = 1 . 4 µm 𝐿 f = 4 . 4 µm ( v ) 𝑁 sca = 2 , 𝑁 f = 8 0 . 5 1 . 0 𝑅 / µm − 4 − 2 0 2 4 𝐹 / p N 𝐿 f = 1 . 4 µm 𝐿 f = 4 . 4 µm ( vi ) 𝑁 sca = 2 , 𝑁 f = 8 1 2 3 𝑅 / µm − 200 0 Δ Φ / k B 𝑇 𝑁 sca = 2 𝑁 sca = 4 𝑁 sca = 8 ( b ) ( i ) 𝑁 f = 8 , 𝐿 f = 3 . 0 µm 1 2 3 𝑅 / µm − 2 0 2 4 𝐹 / p N 𝑁 sca = 2 𝑁 sca = 4 𝑁 sca = 8 ( ii ) 𝑁 f = 8 , 𝐿 f = 3 . 0 µm 1 ( a ) ( i ) ( ii ) Figure 2 . Total free energy and total force as a function of the ring radius . The blue stars indicate the points at which the free energy is minimal , and negative force values indicate a constricting force . In ( a ) , 𝑁 sca = 2 , as per the topology depicted with both 2D periodic boundary conditions ( i ) and in 3D ( ii ) ; the free energies and total forces are then plotted for either a range of 𝑁 f values ( ( iii ) and ( iv ) ) or a range of 𝐿 f values ( ( v ) and ( vi ) ) . The constriction force increases linearly with 𝑁 f . In ( b ) , 𝑁 f = 8 for three values of 𝑁 sca . Connecting the filaments in series ( large 𝑁 sca ) increases the constriction range , while stacking them in parallel ( small 𝑁 sca ) increases the maximum constriction force . Data for all plots was produced with the parameters given in Table S1 [ 19 ] . the range of radii over which the ring can generate force and the maximum possible force it can achieve . While con - necting the filaments in series ( large 𝑁 sca ) favours the for - mer , stacking them in parallel ( small 𝑁 sca ) favours the latter ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) . As can be seen from Eq . ( 4 ) , there is an optimal anillin concentration that maximizes the force , specifically when [ X ] = 𝐾 sD , after which point higher concentrations lead to lower sliding forces [ 18 ] . This decrease in the sliding force occurs because , at higher crosslinker concentrations , the entropy of mixing in solution favours the binding of crosslinkers to a single actin site instead of two , thus im - peding crosslinking and hence the condensation force . In fact , the anillin concentration used in the experiments [ 16 ] happens to be close to 𝐾 sD ( Fig . S6 ) . The ring - constriction experiments of Kučera et al . [ 16 ] were performed under three conditions : stabilized , non - stabilized , or destabilized against depolymerization . Inter - estingly , the constriction of the rings differed markedly un - der these conditions . While differences in the stabilized and non - stabilized conditions could be explained by the difference in the bending rigidity ( the stabilizer rigidifies actin [ 20 ] ) , another explanation is needed for the observa - tion that the destabilized conditions led to further constric - tion than the other two conditions . Our model provides an explanation for this observation : as the filaments depoly - merize , the bending force required for a given radius is lower , and so the equilibrium radius will be smaller . If one consid - ers a point on one of the longer filament length curves in Fig . 2 ( a ) ( v ) , disassembly can be thought of as moving down to another curve of a smaller filament length . So far , we have ignored the frictional forces involved in ring constriction . To study the timescale of ring constriction , we simulate the overdamped ring - constriction dynamics within our model . To do so , we require an expression for the friction coefficient of the ring . Wierenga and Ten Wolde [ 17 ] derived the friction coef - ficient of the sliding of two crosslinked microtubules . The sliding mechanism involves a collective rearrangement of all the crosslinkers in the overlap , wherein the crosslinkers hop between neighbouring sites on the microtubules . This collective rearrangement gives rise to an energy barrier that increases linearly with the number of bound crosslinkers 𝑁 d , and thus a friction coefficient that scales exponentially with 𝑁 d . Additionally , because the crosslinkers can block each other from hopping , the friction scales superexponen - tially with 𝑁 d at higher crosslinker densities . In actin filaments , the distance between crosslinker bind - ing sites 𝛿 d is much larger than the distance over which crosslinkers can hop , as the distance between sites is set by the helical pitch rather than the monomer - monomer dis - tance 𝛿 s [ 21 ] ( Fig . 1 ( a ) ) . This suggests that the above sliding mechanism may be unfeasible . However , actin filaments have been observed to twirl , or rotate , about their axes when they are being slid by myosin motor proteins bound to a sur - face [ 22 – 27 ] . We postulate that passively crosslinked actin filaments must also twirl as they slide , which would allow crosslinkers to hop distances of 𝛿 s ( rather than the larger 𝛿 d ) , thus also allowing the same collective rearrangement as was found for microtubules ( Figs . 1 ( a ) and S4 ) . Because the crosslinkers are spaced at least 𝛿 d apart , they do not block each other when hopping by 𝛿 s to neighbouring sites ( Fig . 1 ( a ) ) . The friction coefficient therefore only scales exponentially with 𝑁 d , not superexponentially as with mi - 3 crotubule sliding [ 17 ] ; as we will see , this difference has dramatic consequences . In the regime where crosslinker binding is fast relative to filament sliding and the average number of crosslinkers is a function of the overlap 𝐿 , the friction coefficient of a single overlap is 𝜁 = 𝜁 0 [ 1 + 𝜉 1 + 𝜉e −𝐵 ] ( 𝐿 𝛿d + 1 ) . ( 5 ) Here , 𝜉 is defined in Eq . ( 1 ) and 𝜁 0 = 𝑘 B 𝑇 𝛿 2s 𝑟 0 √ 1 + 3𝑘𝛿 2s 4𝑘 B 𝑇 , 𝐵 = 𝛿 2s 𝑘 8𝑘 B 𝑇 − ln 2 , ( 6 ) where 𝑘 is the spring constant of the crosslinker , and 𝑟 0 is the jump - rate prefactor for crosslinker hopping ( see Supple - mentary Information [ 19 ] for full derivation ) . The friction coefficient of the ring 𝜁 R can be related to that of a single overlap 𝜁 via 𝜁 R = 4𝜋 2 𝑁 o ∕ 𝑁 2sca 𝜁 by considering the numbers of overlaps acting in series and in parallel ( see Supplemen - tary Information [ 19 ] for full derivation ) . Simulations with this expression for the friction coeffi - cient show that the ring constriction occurs within experi - mental timescales [ 16 ] for the experimentally relevant range of model parameter values ( Fig . 3 ) . Of the parameters , the spring constant has been shown to be the most criti - cal [ 15 , 17 ] . While the value of 𝑘 for anillin has not been measured , crosslinking proteins tend to be on the lower end of the range of values measured in proteins [ 17 , 28 – 38 ] , with values falling within 0 . 3 to 1 . 2 pN nm −1 [ 17 , 31 , 36 , 38 ] . To explore the dynamics in this range of 𝑘 , we first consider a ring with 𝑁 sca = 2 and 𝑁 f = 5 , and a filament length of 3 . 0 µ m , which leads to an equilibrium radius that is around halfway between the maximum and minimum possible radii ( Fig . S7 ( b ) ) . With 𝑘 = 1 . 0 pN nm −1 , the ring constricts almost instantaneously ( Fig . 3 ) . Increasing the value to 𝑘 = 1 . 5 pN nm −1 leads to much slower constriction , but the ring still reaches its equilibrium value within the timescale used in the experiments ( 1000 s ) [ 16 ] . By 𝑘 = 2 . 0 pN nm −1 , the ring constriction stalls before reaching the equilibrium radius . Varying 𝑁 f ( Figs . S8 ( b ) and S11 ) and using a differ - ent value of 𝐿 f ( Fig . S10 ) did not have a large impact on the dynamics . Overall , while microtubule sliding rapidly stalls because the friction becomes prohibitive [ 15 ] , the much weaker scaling of the friction with 𝑁 d for anillin - actin rings means that the latter can constrict to their equilibrium radii on experimental timescales of minutes [ 16 ] . Even when the mean forces on either end of the filaments are balanced , thermal fluctuations in the positions of the filaments imply that the ring will eventually break . How - ever , in Ref . [ 16 ] , the rings were observed to be stable on the timescale of the experiments . During ring constriction , a mechanism exists that would tend to equalize overlaps : if some overlaps fluctuate towards smaller values , then the ring - constriction force will tend to increase their overlap 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 𝜙 R 𝑘 = 1 . 0 pNnm −1 𝑘 = 1 . 5 pNnm −1 𝑘 = 2 . 0 pNnm −1 ( a ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 10 −6 10 −4 𝜁 / s k g − 1 𝑘 = 1 . 0 pNnm −1 𝑘 = 1 . 5 pNnm −1 𝑘 = 2 . 0 pNnm −1 ( b ) 1 Figure 3 .

( b ) Friction coefficient of an overlap in the ring . For numerical details and additional quantities , see Fig . S8 ( a ) ; for trajectories with values of 𝑘 down to 0 . 1pNnm −1 , see Fig . S9 . For the biologically relevant range of 𝑘 , constriction occurs on experimental timescales [ 16 ] . more quickly because they also then have a lower friction . Once the rings have reached equilibrium , we can estimate the timescale on which the ring is stable from 𝜏 = 𝑥 2 ∕ 𝐷 f , where 𝐷 f is the diffusion coefficient of a single filament and 𝑥 is the overlap length at equilibrium . The overlaps of a single filament act in parallel , so the total friction force experienced by a single filament is the sum of the friction of its 𝑛 individual overlaps , which implies that the friction coefficient of a single filament is 𝜁 f = 𝑛𝜁 . We can relate this friction coefficient to the diffusion coefficient of a fila - ment with 𝐷 f = 𝑘 B 𝑇 ∕ 𝜁 f . If we consider a filament with two overlaps , and use the overlap length of the rings modeled in Fig . 3 in equilibrium , 𝑥 = 0 . 75 µ m , as well as the value of the friction coefficient at equilibrium , 𝜁 = 5 × 10 −4 s kg −1 , then 𝜏 = 14 000 s . This is more than an order of magnitude longer than the experimental timescale . Further , this calcu - lation assumes that the overlaps are equal in size , yet fluctu - ations away from this state will lengthen some overlaps at the expense of others , which tends to increase the friction the filament experiences . In other words , the estimate for 𝜏 above gives a lower bound , strengthening the prediction that the rings are stable on much longer timescales than the experiments were performed on . The tension 𝑇 of cytokinetic rings , which is related to the constriction force 𝐹 via 𝑇 = 𝐹 ∕ 2𝜋 , has been measured to be hundreds of pN in fission yeast [ 4 , 39 ] , while here , using experimentally measured values of 𝑁 f , 𝐿 f , and 𝑅 in vivo [ 40 – 42 ] , the tension does not exceed 10 pN . However , even the measured ring tensions are nearly three orders of magnitude too small to balance measured turgor pressures and would , in fact , only produce strains in the cell wall of 0 . 01 % [ 1 ] . Instead of directly constricting the cell , the cytokinetic ring in fission yeast coordinates and guides the inward growth of the cell wall via mechanosensitive enzymes [ 43 , 44 ] . For this function , even a much smaller ring tension may be suf - ficient , if less effective [ 44 ] . These findings in fission yeast , a model organism for eukaryotic division [ 45 , 46 ] , are likely 4 relevant more broadly in fungi ; in budding yeast , a simi - lar interplay between cell - wall growth and cytokinetic - ring constriction has been observed [ 47 ] . While the maximum tension generated by passive crosslinking is smaller than that generated by myosin motors in the cytokinetic ring , the mechanism may provide an explanation for the observa - tions that budding yeast can divide without myosin motor activity [ 12 – 14 ] , possibly in combination with other non - myosin - motor force generating mechanisms [ 48 ] . Regardless of the role of passive - crosslinker - driven con - striction in natural cells , the anillin - actin system is an inter - esting candidate for a cell - division module in a minimal syn - thetic cell . Actin , under polymerizing conditions , can grow into rings centered at the equator of droplets with diame - ters less than the persistence length of actin [ 49 ] . Anillin , besides being a crosslinker of actin , also has domains which bind to lipid membranes , and it appears to play a key role in anchoring the cytokinetic ring to the membrane in animal cells [ 50 ] . Further , experiments [ 51 ] and modeling [ 52 ] indi - cate that constriction of unadorned lipid - membrane vesicles requires contractile forces on the order of a pN , well within the range that can be generated via this mechanism . There - fore , by coupling anillin expression to the cell cycle , the system studied here may constitute a minimal module for triggering cell division upon the completion of DNA repli - cation [ 53 ] .

The data , scripts , and simulation code for this work are accessible via Ref . [ 1 ] . DISCUSSION OF MODEL CONFIGURATION SPACE ASSUMPTIONS In this section , we discuss how anillin bundles actin , the definition of force - generating filaments , the conditions re - quired for ring stability , and the justification for the assump - tion regarding the minimum ring radius . Anillin - actin bundling Drosphila anillin has three actin binding sites , two of which are mutually exclusive [ 2 ] . When anillin bundles actin with only the two binding sites that have the highest affinity , which are on opposing sides of anillin , the resulting bundles form single - layer sheets in which the anillin linkers are all in register [ 2 ] , as in Figs . 1 and 2 of the main text , or in Figs . S1 and S2 ( b ) . The third and weakest binding site is positioned such that it cannot form sheets if bound in combination with the other binding site it is not mutually exclusive with [ 2 ] ; if starting with a 2D sheet , additional filaments would have to stack on top of the sheet when binding with the third site . In experiments , both ordered 2D sheets and thicker , less ordered bundles are observed [ 2 ] . For a small number of filaments , the configuration with the lowest free energy is the sheet formed when only the two highest affinity sites are used , as this will maximize the anillin - actin binding energy . In our model , we assume all binding involves only these two sites . Force - generating filaments We only consider rings where all filaments contribute to the sliding force driving constriction . For a filament to gen - erate force in a ring , it must have at least one overlap on each end ; i . e . the filament must be under tension . For exam - ple , in Fig . S1 ( b ) ( i ) , filaments 1 – 6 have at least one overlap on either end , so are under tension , but filament 7 has only a single overlap , so is not under tension . This ring would have the same sliding force driving constriction as one with - out filament 7 , but would have a lower total constriction force because of the contribution to the bending force from the additional filament . Since we are interested in rings that maximize the constriction force for a given number of filaments , we do not consider these configurations . Ring stability In the analytical theory of the main text , the overlap slid - ing force is taken to be a condensation force , which is inde - pendent of the overlap length . For a ring to be stable , each filament must then have an equal number of overlaps on either end , as this will balance the relative sliding forces . Given the additional simplifying assumption that all fila - ments have the same length , then not all combinations of the total number of force - generating filaments 𝑁 f and the number of filaments in the scaffold ring 𝑁 sca yield rings that are stable . More specifically , for the sliding ( i . e . condensa - tion ) forces to be balanced with each other , when 𝑁 sca is even , 𝑁 f − 𝑁 sca must be a multiple of 𝑁 sca ∕ 2 , while when 𝑁 sca is odd , 𝑁 f can only be equal to 𝑁 sca . For example , if fil - ament 5 in Fig . 1 of the main text were removed , the forces on filaments 1 and 3 would become unbalanced because these filaments would then have two overlaps on one end and only one overlap on the other end ; this would make the ring unstable . To be consistent , we apply these sum rules to our analysis in the main text to ensure we do not study unstable rings . Equal - overlap length assumption In the main text , we make the simplifying assumption that all filaments overlap to the same degree . This allows us to start from a configuration with no overlaps and follow the progress to a configuration with maximal overlaps , as in Fig . 1 ( b ) of the main text . Essentially , we consider a specific limiting case that is representative of many starting configurations . Deviations from equal overlaps can lead to lower con - striction forces , although the effect is expected to be small . When the ring starts with overlaps that differ in size , config - urations can arise where some filament ends start to collide such that their corresponding overlaps no longer drive con - striction ( e . g . filaments 5 and 6 in Fig . S1 ( b ) ( ii ) ) . In our model , this scenario would be accompanied by a discontin - uous drop in the constriction force . If the ring starts out 1 3 5 7 1 2 4 6 8 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 5 6 1 3 1 2 4 7 5 6 1 3 1 2 4 6 1 3 4 7 2 5 6 1 5 3 4 2 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 1 2 3 filament crosslinker periodic boundary ( a ) ( b ) ( i ) ( ii ) ( c ) Figure S1 . ( a ) Topology of a ring with 𝑁 f = 8 and 𝑁 sca = 8 ; a 2D representation with periodic boundary conditions is given on the left , while a 3D representation is given on the right . ( b ) Topology diagrams of rings with configurations not considered by the model that decrease the constriction force ; diagrams with periodic boundary conditions are given at the top and 3D representations below . ( b ) ( i ) A ring with 𝑁 f = 7 and 𝑁 sca = 4 where one of the filaments ( 7 ) is bound to the ring with only a single overlap , leading to a reduction in the total constriction force that the same ring without that filament would generate ; this reduction is because filament 7 produces an opposing bending force but does not contribute to the constriction force . ( b ) ( ii ) A ring with 𝑁 f = 6 and 𝑁 sca = 4 where some of the overlaps have collided , reducing the total force for constriction . ( c ) Topology diagrams of a ring with 𝑁 f = 3 and 𝑁 sca = 2 at and past its minimum radius . On the left the ring has already constricted to half its maximum radius , while on the right it has continued to constrict past this point , leading to deformation in the filaments . The 3D representation of the ring at its minimum radius is given on the top right ; the exact placement of the crosslinkers does not correspond to those depicted on the diagram on the left , as the proportions have been changed , allowing for fewer crosslinkers to be drawn . near its maximum radius , which is likely often the case , then the emerging filament overlaps will be fairly similar in size , making this effect small and only relevant as the ring approaches its minimum radius . Further , the constriction dynamics will cause overlaps to tend towards being similar lengths , since larger overlaps have higher friction and will then decrease at a slower rate ( see the main text for further discussion of this effect in the context of ring stability ) . As such an effect does not significantly change the predictions of the model , but does increase its complexity , we do not consider it in the main text . Minimum ring radius We consider half the maximum radius to be the minimum radius for two reasons . First , at this point , some of the fila - ments would start to collide , which would lead to an energy barrier from the need to bend around each other ( Fig . S1 ( c ) ) . Second , upon reaching half the maximum radius , the ability of the ring to increase its overlap is significantly reduced , as only filaments on the edge of the sheet are able to con - tribute to an increase in filament overlap . To understand this , consider that the edge filaments are engaging in over - lap on only one side , and so are able to add overlap on the other side ( e . g . filaments 1 and 3 in Fig . S1 ( c ) ) , and hence can still sustain a sliding force . The middle filaments , on the other hand , are engaging in overlap at all points along their length by the time they reach half the maximum ra - dius ( e . g . filament 2 in Fig . S1 ( c ) ) ; any further constriction would then not change their overlap length , such that they no longer contribute to the sliding force . DERIVATION OF RING BENDING ENERGY As the circumference of the rings is less than the persis - tence length of single actin filaments ( 17 µ m [ 3 ] ) , we cannot treat the filaments as freely jointed chains . Moreover , mul - tiple connected filaments will be even stiffer than single 8 𝑌 𝑍 𝑑 2 𝑑 3 = 𝑑 2 2𝑅 f 1 2 3 𝐼 1 = 𝐼 cm = 𝜋𝑅4 f 4 𝐼 2 = 𝐼 cm + 𝐴𝑑 22 𝐼 3 = 𝐼 2 𝑋 𝑍 𝑌 2 3 1 𝑌 𝑍 1 2 3 𝐼 1 = 𝐼 2 = 𝐼 3 = 𝐼 cm = 𝜋𝑅4 f 4 1 3 𝑌 2 𝑋 𝑍 ( a ) ( b ) Figure S2 . Cross sections of three crosslinked filaments to be bent around the 𝑌 axis . ( a ) The three filaments are oriented such that only the middle one lies on the bending axis . The filaments tangentially extend in the 𝑋 direction , and so the cross section is drawn with the 𝑌 and 𝑍 axis . A ring configuration that would lead to this situation is given to the right . ( b ) The three filaments are oriented such that all lie on the bending axis . This configuration minimizes the bending energy ; a ring configuration that would lead to this situation is given at the top right . filaments . We therefore treat the ring as a simple linearly elastic rod [ 4 ] . This allows us to apply beam theory , which predicts that the elastic potential energy of a section of the ring is 𝑈 B = 1 2 ∫ 𝐿 s 0 𝐵 ( 𝑠 ) 𝜅 ( 𝑠 ) 2 d𝑠 , ( S1 ) where 𝐵 ( 𝑠 ) is the bending rigidity ( also known as the bend - ing stiffness , the flexular stiffness , and the flexular rigidity ) , 𝜅 is the curvature , 𝐿 s is the length of the section of the ring , and the integral is over the contour of the line formed by the ring with arc length parameter 𝑠 . If we assume the ring geometry to be perfectly circular ( for anillin - actin rings this is reasonable based on the images in Ref . [ 5 ] ) , then the cur - vature is simply the reciprocal of the ring radius 𝑅 . We can then decompose the ring into segments with different bend - ing rigidities , based on the number of filaments and their configuration . The bending rigidity 𝐵 = 𝐸𝐼 is the product of the Young’s modulus 𝐸 with the second moment of area , 𝐼 , which contains the geometric contribution to the bending rigidity . The potential for segment 𝑖 in the ring can then be written as 𝑈 B𝑖 = 1 2 ∫ 𝐿 s𝑖 0 𝐸𝐼 𝑖 𝑅 2 d𝑠 = 𝐸𝐼 𝑖 𝐿 s𝑖 2𝑅 2 , ( S2 ) where 𝐿 s𝑖 is the length of segment 𝑖 . To calculate 𝐼 𝑖 , first consider a filament lying along the 𝑋 axis . If the bending is around the 𝑌 axis , then the second moment of area is defined as 𝐼 = ∫ 𝐴 𝑌 2 d𝐴 , ( S3 ) where the integration is done over a cross section of area 𝐴 of the filament in an undeformed configuration . If we assume that the filaments have cylindrical geometry , then the second moment of area for a single filament is 𝐼 = 𝜋𝑅 4f 4 , ( S4 ) where 𝑅 f is the radius of the cross section of the filament . For crosslinked filaments , if we ignore the contribution of the crosslinkers , we can calculate their second moment of area . To do so , it is convenient to apply the parallel axis theorem , which allows the second moment of area to be calculated when an expression is known for a given cross - sectional shape , but with the bending axis having been trans - lated relative to it . This gives 𝐼 = ( 𝐼 cm + 𝐴𝑑 2 ) , ( S5 ) where 𝐼 cm is the known second moment of area when the center of geometry is on the bending axis , and 𝑑 is the dis - tance from the bending axis ( Fig . S2 ) . For a given configu - ration of filaments , we then have 𝐼 𝑖 = ∑ 𝑗 𝜋𝑅 2f ( 𝑅 2f 4 + 𝑑 2𝑗 ) , ( S6 ) where 𝑗 is the filament index . Because of the way anillin bundles actin into sheets , for anillin - actin rings , the bending resistance is minimized when 𝑑 = 0 for all filaments ( Fig . S2 ( b ) ) . In other words , such a ring will have its minimum free energy when the filaments form a sheet - like configuration such that each fil - ament is bent to the same extent ( e . g . Fig . 1 ( b ) of the main text and Fig . S2 ( b ) ) , in contrast to a configuration where the filaments are stacked such that they have different curva - tures ( Fig . S2 ( a ) ) . The second moment of area of a segment is then simply given by the number of filaments in that seg - ment multiplied by the second moment of area of a single filament . This allows the bending energy of the whole ring to be calculated by summing over each filament instead of over the segments , giving 𝑈 B = 𝑁 f 𝐸𝐼𝐿 f 2𝑅 2 . ( S7 ) We test whether the assumptions of beam theory in this regime are valid by comparing the energy calculated from Eq . ( S7 ) to the energy of the rings calculated with geomet - rically nonlinear elasticity , or the Saint Venant - Kirchhoff 9 10 −7 10 −6 10 −5 10 −4 10 −3 Length / m 1 . 00 1 . 01 1 . 02 1 . 03 B e a m t h e o r y e n e r g y / F E M e n e r g y 𝐸 = 1 . 0 × 10 9 Nm −2 , 𝜈 = 0 . 0 𝐸 = 2 . 0 × 10 9 Nm −2 , 𝜈 = 0 . 0 𝐸 = 2 . 0 × 10 9 Nm −2 , 𝜈 = 0 . 45 1 Figure S3 . Ratio of beam - theory energy to geometrically - nonlinear - elasticity energy of a single filament , face - to - face ring as a function of filament length . The geometrically - nonlinear en - ergies are calculated by first solving for the deformation , given the constraints that the end faces of the filament must be touching . The finite element method was used to solve these equations , in particular the deal . II library [ 6 , 7 ] . A rectangular - cuboid geometry was used for simplicity , with the height taken to be twice the radius used by Kojima et al . [ 8 ] ( 2 . 8nm ) to calculate the Young’s modulus . To ensure good convergence , 10 000 divisions were made along the filament axis , while no divisions were made in perpendicular axes . model . This model of elasticity is still linear in the stress - strain relation , but includes nonlinearity in the strain tensor . In Fig . S3 we plot the ratio of the beam - theory energy to the geometrically - nonlinear - elasticity energy for a single fila - ment forming a ring in which the faces of the two ends of the filament are constrained to touch for a range of filament lengths . At short enough filament lengths , regardless of the bending rigidity , the two models diverge , but within the range of filament lengths considered here , the error involved with the simpler beam theory model is insignificant . Geo - metrically nonlinear elasticity has an additional parameter , the Poisson’s ratio 𝜈 , and while it can affect the regime of validity of beam theory , it also has no significant effect on the results in the range of filament lengths relevant here . The validity of beam theory in this regime is also supported by experimental results [ 4 ] . RING - CONSTRICTION DYNAMICS We assume the system is in the overdamped limit , in which case the Langevin equation is a first - order stochas - tic differential equation . To fully specify the dynamics , we must also specify the interpretation used for the stochas - tic integral [ 9 ] . Here , we use the Ito interpretation , which , when the friction is position dependent , results in a spurious drift term [ 10 ] , giving d𝑅 = [ 𝐹 R 𝜁 R + d d𝑅 ( 𝑘 B 𝑇 𝜁 R ) ] dt + √ 2𝑘 B 𝑇 𝜁 R d𝑊 , ( S8 ) where 𝐹 R is the constriction force , 𝜁 R is the friction coef - ficient for ring constriction , 𝑘 B is Boltzmann’s constant , 𝑇 is the temperature , and d𝑊 is a Wiener increment . The constriction force referred to in the main text is defined as 𝐹 = 𝐹 R = −d𝑈d𝑅 , ( S9 ) where 𝑈 is the ring energy discussed in the main text . An expression for this force is given in Eq . 4 of the main text , so to solve for the dynamics , the only additional expression needed is for the friction coefficient . DERIVATION OF FRICTION COEFFICIENT In this section , we derive the friction coefficient for ring - constriction dynamics . In particular , we show how the fric - tion coefficient for ring constriction can be expressed in terms of the friction coefficient of a single overlap and the two parameters that characterize the ring topology , 𝑁 f and 𝑁 sca . We then derive an exact form for the friction coeffi - cient of a single overlap with a constant number of bound crosslinkers , and an approximate form that agrees well with the exact one . Finally , we use the result in the regime with a constant number of crosslinkers to derive the friction co - efficient in the regime with a constant crosslinker concen - tration . Relation between ring friction and single - overlap friction The friction coefficient for radial ring - constriction dynam - ics 𝜁 R can be related to that of a single overlap 𝜁 . To do so , first consider the balance of forces in a slice of the ring . The friction force is determined by the friction coefficients of individual overlaps , the rate at which the filaments slide , and their connectivity in the ring . The constriction rate of individual overlaps connected in series , relative to the con - striction rate of the circumference 𝐶 , decreases with the number of overlaps connected in series , which is 𝑁 sca ; the friction associated with the circumference is thus decreased by a factor of 1 ∕ 𝑁 sca . On the other hand , the friction of over - laps acting in parallel must be summed to calculate the total friction . With the assumptions of the main text , where the total number of overlaps 𝑁 o = 2𝑁 f − 𝑁 sca , there are 𝑁 o ∕ 𝑁 sca overlaps in parallel in a given slice of a ring ; the friction is thus increased by a factor of 𝑁 o ∕ 𝑁 sca . Taking into account both effects leads to a total friction given by 𝐹 f = 𝑁 o 𝑁 2sca 𝜁 d𝐶 d𝑡 ( S10a ) = 𝑁 o 𝑁 2sca 𝜁 d𝐶 d𝑅 d𝑅 d𝑡 ( S10b ) = 2𝜋𝑁 o 𝑁 2sca 𝜁 d𝑅 d𝑡 . ( S10c ) This friction force balances with the circumferential con - striction force , 𝐹 C , 𝐹 C = 𝐹 f ( S11a ) 10 −d𝑈 d𝑅 d𝑅 d𝐶 = 2𝜋𝑁 o 𝑁 2sca 𝜁 d𝑅 d𝑡 , ( S11b ) which , upon rearranging , gives −d𝑈 d𝑅 = 4𝜋 2 𝑁 o 𝑁 2sca 𝜁 d𝑅 d𝑡 ( S12a ) 𝐹 R = 𝜁 R d𝑅 d𝑡 , ( S12b ) thus giving the desired relation between the friction coeffi - cient for radial ring - constriction dynamics and the friction coefficient of a single overlap , 𝜁 R = 4𝜋 2 𝑁 o 𝑁 2sca 𝜁 . ( S13 ) We give an alternative derivation of the relation between 𝜁 R and 𝜁 in the Appendix . Derivation of single - overlap friction coefficient Wierenga and Ten Wolde [ 11 ] and Wierenga [ 12 ] have developed expressions for the friction coefficient of a single overlap 𝜁 . Their approach is to relate the height of the free - energy barrier ∆ ℱ ‡ for filament sliding to the friction coef - ficient via two expressions . First , for a system with discrete jumps on a lattice with spacing 𝛿 , the friction coefficient can be related to the jump rate in one direction 𝑟 via the Einstein equation , 𝜁 = 𝑘 B 𝑇 𝐷 = 𝑘 B 𝑇 𝛿 2 𝑟 . ( S14 ) Then , the jump rate can be related to the free - energy barrier with the Arrhenius equation , 𝑟 = 𝑟 0 e −𝛽 ∆ ℱ ‡ , ( S15 ) where 𝛽 −1 = 𝑘 B 𝑇 , and 𝑟 0 is the jump - rate prefactor . In the Ase1 - microtubule system , the microtubules are crosslinked at discrete sites , where the lattice spacing 𝛿 is set by the tubulin - dimer distance . Microtubules slide in increments of 𝛿 by a collective rearrangement , wherein all crosslinkers hop to a neighbouring site [ 11 ] . In the process of hopping , the crosslinkers are stretched from their equi - librium length . In actin , whose filaments form a double helix , the filaments are also crosslinked at discrete sites , but the crosslinker spacing is set by the helical pitch rather than by the monomer - monomer distance 𝛿 s , as the sites only line up every half - turn of the filaments ( Fig . S4 ) . This distance 𝛿 d is far larger than the size of a crosslinker , making the mechanism observed in microtubule sliding seem unfeasi - ble . However , studies of myosin - driven actin sliding show that actin filaments tend to twirl , or rotate , about their axes 𝑥 = 𝐿 𝛿 s 𝛿 d 𝛿 s / 2 R L R 𝛿 s / 2 𝛿 s 𝛿 s 𝛿 s 𝛿 s 𝛿 s ( i ) ( ii ) ( iii ) ( iv ) ( v ) ( vi ) ( vii ) ( viii ) Figure S4 . Diagrams of a mobile filament sliding over a fixed filament to increase the overlap 𝐿 by 𝛿 d from ( i ) to ( viii ) . One monomer is coloured in grey to better illustrate the twisting of the top filament . Over the first two increments , the top filament is shown to slide in increments of 𝛿 s ∕ 2 to illustrate in ( ii ) an example of a configuration at the peak of the barrier to sliding ; 𝑅 denotes a crosslinker that pulls the mobile top filament to the right , while 𝐿 denotes a crosslinker that pulls the mobile top filament to the left . All other configurations are shown when the binding sites are in register . In every configuration , all available crosslinker sites are filled ; i . e . the configurations are shown at maximum occupancy . In ( vii ) , the number of sites that can be crosslinked increases from three to four , as at this point the binding site on the far right of the mobile filament is within a distance of 𝛿 s from a nearly aligned binding site on the fixed filament . 11 as they are slid by myosin motors anchored to a surface [ 13 – 18 ] . We therefore argue that the same collective hopping can occur , but with the actin filament rotating while sliding . Then , each collective rearrangement would occur with the monomer - monomer distance of one of the two intertwined filaments in the double helix , thus with spacing 𝛿 s instead of 𝛿 d ( Fig . S4 ) . If we assume that crosslinkers can stretch to bind to a site a distance no more than 𝛿 s away , then the number of overlapping sites 𝓁 can be related to the overlap length 𝐿 with 𝓁 = ⎢⎢ ⎣ 1 𝛿 d ( 𝐿 + 𝛿 s ) ⎥⎥ ⎦ + 1 ( S16a ) ≈ ⎢⎢ ⎣ 𝐿 𝛿 d ⎥⎥ ⎦ + 1 ( S16b ) ≈ 𝐿 𝛿 d + 1 , ( S16c ) where first two lines use the floor function ( see Fig . S4 ( vii ) to understand Eq . ( S16a ) ) , and the third line is the continuous approximation of 𝓁 , which we will use henceforth unless otherwise stated ( or implied by use in a combinatorial ex - pression ) . Friction coefficient for constant number of crosslinkers Wierenga and Ten Wolde [ 11 ] derive an exact form for the free - energy barrier of the sliding of an overlapping fil - ament , in their case a microtubule , when the number of bound crosslinkers is constant . We follow the same steps to derive an exact form for the free - energy barrier to actin - filament sliding , which involve writing out the potential , determining the number of microstates , and selecting a re - action coordinate for filament sliding . In their derivation , they consider one of the filaments to be fixed , and then parti - tion the crosslinkers into those that pull the mobile filament to the right , and those that pull it to the left ( Fig . S4 ( ii ) ) . If we consider a fixed bottom filament and a mobile top filament , and define 𝑥 as the modulated position of the filament tip with 𝑥 = 𝐿 mod 𝛿 s , then the potential energy can be written as 𝑈 ( 𝑥 , 𝑁 R ) = 1 2𝑘𝑥 2 ( 𝑁 d − 𝑁 R ) + 1 2𝑘 ( 𝛿 s − 𝑥 ) 2 𝑁 R ( S17a ) = 1 2𝑘𝛿 2s 𝑁 d [ ( 𝑥 𝛿 s − 𝑁 R 𝑁 d ) 2 + 𝑁 R 𝑁 d ( 1 − 𝑁 R 𝑁 d ) ] , ( S17b ) where 𝑁 d is the number of bound crosslinkers , 𝑁 R is the number of right - pulling crosslinkers ( Fig . S4 ( ii ) ) , and 𝑘 is the spring constant of the crosslinker . In their system , crosslinkers can be bound at adjacent sites , which compli - cates the calculation of the entropic contribution to the free energy , as the right - pulling crosslinkers can block binding of left - pulling crosslinkers to adjacent sites . Here , because the crosslinker - crosslinker spacing 𝛿 d is much larger than the crosslinker hopping distance 𝛿 s ( Fig . S4 ( i ) ) , they can - not block each other when stretched , simplifying the cal - culation of the entropic contribution . Then , the number of microstates as a function of the number of right - pulling crosslinkers is Ω ( 𝑁 R ) = ( 𝓁 𝑁 d ) ( 𝑁 d 𝑁 R ) . ( S18 ) Wierenga and Ten Wolde [ 11 ] found a good description of the reaction coordinate for sliding a distance of 𝛿 s , 𝛼 = 1 2 ( 𝑥 𝛿 s + 𝑁 R 𝑁 d ) . ( S19 ) Using this reaction coordinate , the partition function is then 𝑄 ( 𝛼 , 𝓁 ) = 𝑁 d ∑ 𝑁 R = 0 𝟙 ( 0 ≤ 2𝛼 − 𝑁 R 𝑁 d ≤ 1 ) ( 𝓁 𝑁 d ) ( 𝑁 d 𝑁 R ) × e − 𝑘𝛿 2 s 𝑁 d 2𝑘B𝑇 [ 4 ( 𝛼− 𝑁R𝑁d ) 2 + 𝑁R𝑁d ( 1− 𝑁R𝑁d ) ] , ( S20 ) where 𝟙 ( 𝑎 ) is the indicator function , being 1 if 𝑎 is true , and 0 otherwise . Because the number of binding sites only changes at intervals of 𝛿 d , while sliding occurs on the scale of 𝛿 s , 𝓁 will not change for most barrier crossings ( Fig . S4 ) . With constant 𝓁 , the barrier to sliding a distance of 𝛿 s can be calculated with the ratio of the partition functions at 𝛼 = 0 , 𝑄 ( 𝛼 = 0 , 𝓁 ) = ( 𝓁 𝑁 d ) , ( S21 ) and 𝛼 = 1 ∕ 2 , 𝑄 ( 𝛼 = 1 ∕ 2 , 𝓁 ) = 𝑁 d ∑ 𝑁 R = 0 ( 𝓁 𝑁 d ) ( 𝑁 d 𝑁 R ) e − 𝑘𝛿2s𝑁d2𝑘B𝑇 [ 3 𝑁2d ( 𝑁 R − 𝑁d2 ) 2 + 1 4 ] , ( S22 ) to give 𝛽 ∆ ℱ ‡ = − ln [ 𝑄 ( 𝛼 = 1 ∕ 2 , 𝓁 ) 𝑄 ( 𝛼 = 0 , 𝓁 ) ] ( S23a ) = ln ⎡⎢⎢ ⎣ 𝑁 d ∑ 𝑁 R = 0 ( 𝑁 d 𝑁 R ) −1 e 𝑘𝛿 2 s𝑁d2𝑘B𝑇 [ 3 𝑁2d ( 𝑁 R − 𝑁d2 ) 2 + 1 4 ] ⎤⎥⎥ ⎦ . ( S23b ) When sliding also increases the number of sites , the barrier height will change , and it will also become dependent on whether the overlap is increasing or decreasing ; as a first approximation , we will ignore this effect . To derive an approximate exponential form for the bar - rier , we can again follow Wierenga and Ten Wolde [ 11 ] . In their derivation , they use a Gaussian approximation for the binomials , which involves expanding at 𝑁 R = 𝑁 d ∕ 2 , which is where the summand in Eq . ( S23b ) peaks , ( 𝑁 d 𝑁 R ) ≈ √ 2 𝜋𝑁 d e 𝑁 d ln2− 2 𝑁d ( 𝑁 R − 𝑁d2 ) 2 . ( S24 ) 12 Using this approximation , the partition function ratio here is then 𝑄 ( 𝛼 = 1 ∕ 2 , 𝓁 ) 𝑄 ( 𝛼 = 0 , 𝓁 ) ≈ √ 2 𝜋𝑁 d e 𝑁 d ln2− 𝑘𝛿2s𝑁d8𝑘B𝑇 × 𝑁 d ∑ 𝑁 R = 0 e − ( 3𝑘𝛿2s 2𝑁d𝑘B𝑇 2 𝑁d ) ( 𝑁 R − 𝑁d2 ) 2 . ( S25 ) With the assumption that 𝑁 d is large enough to approximate as a continuous variable , the sum in the above expression can be approximated as an integral over the entire real line , which , with the appropriate substitution , results in a Gaus - sian integral . Solving the integral , rearranging , and plug - ging the approximation of the partition function ratio back into the expression for the barrier gives 𝛽 ∆ ℱ ‡ ≈ 𝐴 + 𝐵𝑁 d , ( S26 ) where 𝐴 = 1 2 ln ( 1 + 3𝑘𝛿 2s 4𝑘 B 𝑇 ) , ( S27 ) and 𝐵 = 𝛿 2s 𝑘 8𝑘 B 𝑇 − ln 2 . ( S28 ) The resulting friction coefficient is 𝜁 = 𝜁 0 e 𝐵𝑁 d , ( S29 ) where 𝜁 0 = 𝑘 B 𝑇 𝛿 2s 𝑟 0 √ 1 + 3𝑘𝛿 2s 4𝑘 B 𝑇 . ( S30 ) Here , unlike the form derived by Wierenga and Ten Wolde [ 11 ] , where the crosslinkers can block each other , the friction coefficient does not have a superexponential depen - dence on the density . The friction depends only exponen - tially on the number of bound crosslinker 𝑁 d , reflecting the fact that the filament hopping rate depends exponentially on the barrier to hopping , with the latter scaling linearly with 𝑁 d . With the parameters in Table S1 , the barrier calculated with the exponential approximation agrees well with the barrier calculated with the exact form if 𝑁 d ≥ 4 ( Fig . S5 ( a ) ) . With both calculation methods , the barrier does not simply decrease with decreasing 𝑘 , but increases when 𝑘 is suffi - ciently low . In the exponential approximation to the bar - rier , Eq . ( S26 ) , the relationship is clear : whether the barrier increases or decreases with 𝑘 for a given 𝑁 d depends on the sign of 𝐵 . The sign determines whether the energy of stretching these linkers ( the first term of the right - hand side ( RHS ) of Eq . ( S28 ) ) or the entropy of mixing the left - and Δℱ ‡ ( 𝑁 d ) , Eq . ( S20b ) Δℱ ‡ exp ( 𝑁 d ) , Eq . ( S23 ) Δℱ ‡ exp ( ℓ ) , Eq .

( a ) Comparison of the free - energy barrier as a function of 𝑁 d calculated with the exact expression ( Eq . ( S23b ) , “ ∆ ℱ ‡ ( 𝑁 d ) ” ) , and with the exponential approximation ( Eq . ( S26 ) , “ ∆ ℱ ‡exp ( 𝑁 d ) ” ) and as a function of 𝓁 with the constant [ X ] expression ( Eq . ( S39 ) , “ ∆ ℱ ‡exp ( 𝓁 ) ” ) , each with four different values of 𝑘 that encompass the range of measured values of 𝑘 for crosslinkers [ 11 , 19 – 21 ] . The exponential approximation with constant 𝑁 d agrees very well with the exact expression for 𝑁 d ≥ 4 ; for 𝑁 d = 2 and 𝑁 d = 3 , the expo - nential form gives a slightly higher and lower barrier , respectively , while 𝑁 d = 1 , the exponential form gives a significantly lower bar - rier . The values of 𝓁 are aligned with the values of 𝑁 d that equal the equilibrium average ( see Eq . ( S41b ) for the average occupancy ) . The constant [ X ] expression agrees well with the constant 𝑁 d ex - pressions , with only small deviations at values of 𝑘 and 𝑁 d that lead to large barriers . For a given 𝑁 d , there is an optimal value of 𝑘 that minimizes the barrier . ( b ) Plot of the hopping rate prefactor 𝑟 0 as a function of 𝑁 d for four different values of 𝑘 . The dependence of 𝑟 0 is roughly linear , in contrast to the exponential dependence in the microtubule system of Ref . [ 11 ] . Data for both plots were produced with the parameters given in Table S1 . right - pulling crosslinkers ( the second term of the RHS of Eq . ( S28 ) ) dominates . When 𝐵 < 0 and 𝐵𝑁 d > −𝐴 , the peak of the barrier is shifted to 𝛼 = 0 , and the trough to 𝛼 = 1 ∕ 2 . This implies that for a given 𝑁 d , there is a value of 𝑘 that will minimize the friction , specifically that which leads to 𝐴 = −𝐵𝑁 d . Friction coefficient for constant crosslinker concentration Wierenga [ 12 ] uses the approximate form for the free - energy barrier to sliding with constant 𝑁 d to derive the fric - tion coefficient in the regime with fast crosslinker binding , where the crosslinker concentration is held constant instead . As in the previous section , we follow their approach to de - rive the friction coefficient for actin - filament sliding . The partition function is now the weighted sum of partition func - tions with constant 𝑁 d . The weights include both the usual grand - ensemble weight and the weight associated with the free energy of binding . For bound crosslinkers , the weight is 𝜉 d = e 𝛽𝜇 X e −𝛽 ∆ ℱ d , ( S31 ) 13 where 𝜇 X is the chemical potential of the crosslinkers in solution , and ∆ ℱ d is the free energy of binding a crosslinker from solution . If we assume the crosslinkers act ideally in solution and use the definition of the dissociation constants in terms of the free energy , then we can simplify the weight to 𝜉 d = [ X ] 𝐾 dD , ( S32 ) where 𝐾 dD is the dissociation constant for crosslinkers bind - ing to two filaments from solution . The grand partition function also includes the effect of crosslinkers bound with only one end , or in other words , to only a single filament , on the average number of bound crosslinkers . We will refer to these as “singly bound” sites or crosslinkers . The weight for singly bound crosslinkers can similarly be written as 𝜉 s = [ X ] 𝐾 s D , ( S33 ) where 𝐾 sD is the dissociation constant for crosslinkers bind - ing to a single filament from solution . Using these weights , the grand partition function is Ξ ( 𝛼 , 𝓁 ) = 𝓁 ∑ 𝑁 d = 0 𝜉 𝑁 d d 𝑄 ( 𝛼 , 𝓁 ) 𝓁 f −2𝑁 d ∑ 𝑁 s = 0 ( 2 ( 𝓁 f − 𝑁 d ) 𝑁 s ) 𝜉 𝑁 s s ( S34a ) = 𝓁 ∑ 𝑁 d = 0 𝜉 𝑁 d d 𝑄 ( 𝛼 , 𝓁 ) ( 1 + 𝜉 s ) 2 ( 𝓁 f −𝑁 d ) ( S34b ) = ( 1 + 𝜉 s ) 2𝓁 f 𝓁 ∑ 𝑁 d = 0 𝜉 𝑁 d 𝑄 ( 𝛼 , 𝓁 ) , ( S34c ) where 𝑁 s is the number of singly bound crosslinkers , 𝓁 f is the number of binding sites on a single filament , and 𝜉 = 𝜉 d ( 1 + 𝜉 s ) 2 . ( S35 ) If we redefine the reference state , we can drop the term before the sum in the last line to give Ξ ( 𝛼 , 𝓁 ) = 𝓁 ∑ 𝑁 d = 0 𝜉 𝑁 d 𝑄 ( 𝛼 , 𝓁 ) . ( S36 ) For 𝛼 = 0 , Ξ ( 𝛼 = 0 , 𝓁 ) = 𝓁 ∑ 𝑁 d = 0 𝜉 𝑁 d 𝑄 ( 𝛼 = 0 , 𝓁 ) ( S37a ) = 𝓁 ∑ 𝑁 d = 0 𝜉 𝑁 d ( 𝓁 𝑁 d ) ( S37b ) = ( 1 + 𝜉 ) 𝓁 , ( S37c ) while for 𝛼 = 1 ∕ 2 , Ξ ( 𝛼 = 1 ∕ 2 , 𝓁 ) = 𝓁 ∑ 𝑁 d = 0 𝜉 𝑁 d 𝑄 ( 𝛼 = 1 ∕ 2 , 𝓁 ) ( S38a ) = 𝓁 ∑ 𝑁 d = 0 𝜉 𝑁 d e −𝛽 ∆ ℱ ‡ 𝑄 ( 𝛼 = 0 , 𝓁 ) ( S38b ) ≈ 𝓁 ∑ 𝑁 d = 0 𝜉 𝑁 d e 𝐴 + 𝐵𝑁 d ( 𝓁 𝑁 d ) ( S38c ) = e −𝐴 ( 1 + 𝜉e −𝐵 ) 𝓁 . ( S38d ) Taken together , the barrier becomes 𝛽 ∆ ℱ ‡ ≈ 𝐴 + 𝓁 ln [ 1 + 𝜉 1 + 𝜉e −𝐵 ] , ( S39 ) which gives a friction coefficient of 𝜁 = 𝜁 0 [ 1 + 𝜉 1 + 𝜉e −𝐵 ] ( 𝐿 𝛿d + 1 ) . ( S40 ) We can compare the barrier in this regime to one with constant 𝑁 d if we set 𝑁 d to its equilibrium value for a given 𝓁 . If we only consider states where the binding sites are in register , around which the system will spend the majority of the time , then the equilibrium occupancy of a single site is ⟨𝑁 d 𝓁 ⟩ = 𝜉 d ( 1 + 𝜉 s ) 2 + 𝜉 d ( S41a ) = 1 + 𝐾 sD2 [ X ] 𝐾 dD ( 𝐾 sD + [ X ] ) 2 . ( S41b ) Because the sites are independent , ⟨𝑁 d ⟩ = 𝓁⟨ 𝑁 d ∕ 𝓁 ⟩ . From Fig . S5 ( a ) , we see good agreement with the expressions for constant 𝑁 d , with noticeable deviation only at values of 𝑘 and 𝑁 d that lead to large barriers . Estimation of jump - rate prefactor Wierenga [ 12 ] uses Kramers’ theory to derive an approx - imate expression for the prefactor that appears in the Ar - rhenius equation ( Eq . ( S15 ) ) , 𝑟 0 . Kramers’ theory gives 𝑟 0 in terms of the free - energy profile ∆ ℱ ( 𝛼 ) and the diffusion coefficient along the barrier 𝐷 ( 𝛼 ) as functions of the reac - tion coordinate 𝛼 ; with some approximations , this produces an expression for 𝑟 0 in terms of the free - energy barrier and the diffusion coefficient of the filament at the peak of the barrier , 𝐷 ‡ , 𝑟 0 = [ ∫ 1 0 e 𝛽 [ ∆ ℱ ( 𝛼 ) − ∆ ℱ ‡ ] 𝐷 ( 𝛼 ) d𝛼 ∫ 1 0 e −𝛽 ∆ ℱ ( 𝛼 ) d𝛼 ] −1 ( S42a ) 14 ≈ 8 ( 𝛽 ∆ ℱ ‡ ) 3 𝐷 ‡ 𝜋 8 ( 𝛽 ∆ ℱ ‡ ) 2 + 4𝛽 ∆ ℱ ‡ + 5 . ( S42b ) To derive this expression , they approximate the free - energy profile with a sinusoidal function , using the barrier peak to set the amplitude , and use an asymptotic expansion valid for sufficiently larger barriers . Further , they assume that 𝐷 ( 𝛼 ) can be approximated by 𝐷 ‡ , which they justify by the fact that the contribution to the integral in Eq . ( S42a ) is largest around the barrier peak and that the variation in the diffusion coefficient with respect to 𝛼 is small relative to the variation in the free - energy profile . We can use Eq . ( S42b ) to estimate the prefactor for actin - filament sliding , but the expression for 𝐷 ‡ , in addition to the expression for ∆ ℱ ‡ , will differ from those of microtubules . For the free - energy barrier , we use the exact expression given in Eq . ( S23b ) . The diffusion coefficient at the peak is approximated in terms of the diffusion coefficient of a filament in water , 𝐷 m , the hopping rate of a singly bound crosslinker , ℎ 0 , and the number of bound crosslinkers , 𝑁 d , 𝐷 ‡ = 1 4 ( 𝐷 m 𝛿 2s + ℎ 0 𝑁 d ) . ( S43 ) The expression here differs from that in Ref . [ 12 ] because , as discussed above , in the anillin - actin system , bound crosslinkers cannot block each other from hopping , so the total hopping rate does not decrease with a higher density of bound crosslinkers . The diffusion coefficient of an actin fil - ament can be approximated with an expression derived for rigid rods for the diffusion coefficient of translation parallel to the cylindrical axis [ 22 – 24 ] , 𝐷 m ≈ 𝐷 ‖ = 𝑘 B 𝑇 ( ln 𝐿 f ⌀ f − 𝛾 ‖ ) 2𝜋𝜂𝐿 f , ( S44 ) where ⌀ f is the diameter of an actin filament , 𝛾 ‖ is an end - correction coefficient , and 𝜂 is the viscosity of the fluid . Here we use the value for 𝛾 ‖ used by Li and Tang [ 22 ] , while for 𝜂 we use the value of pure water at 298 K [ 25 ] . The re - maining term in 𝐷 ‡ , ℎ 0 , can be estimated from the diffusion constant of singly bound anillin , which has been experimen - tally measured [ 5 ] , with ℎ 0 = 𝐷 s 𝛿 2s . ( S45 ) However , 𝐷 m is two orders of magnitude larger than 𝐷 s , so the contribution of the ℎ 0 term in Eq . ( S43 ) is insignificant . Because the hopping rate depends exponentially on 𝑁 d through the barrier but only linearly through 𝑟 0 , we calcu - late one value of 𝑟 0 , at 𝑁 d = 4 , for a given value of the spring constant 𝑘 . There is also some evidence to expect that 𝑟 0 should be approximately constant with respect to changes in 𝑁 d . To test Eq . ( S42b ) , Wierenga [ 12 ] compared values for a range of 𝑁 d at several overlap lengths to Brownian dynamics simulations that explicitly modeled the collective hopping of crosslinkers to allow sliding of the filament . Overall , their expression was shown to give values of 𝑟 0 with the right order of magnitude , but with an exponential dependence on the crosslinker occupancy . The simulation values of 𝑟 0 tended to be relatively flat with changes in the occupancy and the total number of bound crosslinkers . Our expres - sions for ∆ ℱ ‡ and 𝐷 ‡ are linearly dependent on the total number of bound crosslinkers , but not exponentially on the density . A plot of 𝑟 0 shows that it increases roughly linearly with 𝑁 d ( Fig . S5 ( b ) ) . While we do not have simulations with explicit crosslinker hopping for the anillin - actin system to compare the analytical approximation to , it should be simi - lar to the microtubule system at low densities . DISCUSSION OF MODEL PARAMETERS The model has four constants which must be known to calculate forces : the bending rigidity 𝐸𝐼 of actin , the spacing between anillin binding sites on actin 𝛿 d , the dissociation constant of anillin binding to a single actin filament 𝐾 sD , and the dissociation constant of anillin crosslinking two actin filaments 𝐾 dD . To model the dynamics , an additional three parameters are needed : the actin monomer - monomer distance 𝛿 s , the spring constant of a crosslinker 𝑘 , and the jump - rate prefactor for crosslinker hopping 𝑟 0 . Because we use an analytical approximation to estimate 𝑟 0 , that single parameter becomes four : the diffusion coefficient of a singly bound anillin 𝐷 s , the viscosity of water 𝜂 , the end - correction coefficient of the parallel translation diffusion coefficient of a rod 𝛾 ‖ , and the diameter of an actin filament ⌀ f . The model parameters are collected in Table S1 . The bending rigidity of single actin filaments has been measured and calculated in many studies [ 3 , 4 , 8 , 27 – 29 ] . Van Mameren et al . [ 3 ] determined a value of 7 . 1 × 10 −26 Nm 2 by bending filaments , measuring the re - sponse , and fitting a nonlinear elastic model . Their result is broadly similar to what has been found in older studies that used other methods that actively perturb filaments [ 4 , 8 ] , as well as to results with methods that passively observe thermal fluctuations [ 27 – 30 ] . However , most of these stud - ies considered actin filaments stabilized by the presence of phalloidin . In the ring experiments of Kučera et al . [ 5 ] , they use conditions both with and without phalloidin . Isambert et al . [ 27 ] found that without the presence of phalloidin , actin filaments are about twice as flexible . This corresponds to a bending rigidity of 3 . 6 × 10 −26 Nm 2 . One way to estimate 𝛿 d would be to consider that , on one side of the helical actin filaments , a monomer repeats about about every 6 nm [ 26 ] . However , Matsuda et al . [ 31 ] found that anillin only binds when the twist of the helix of the two filaments is properly aligned , which only occurs every 36 nm [ 26 ] , and so we choose this value for 𝛿 d . Since there are 13 monomers along one strand every 2𝛿 d , we define 𝛿 s = 2𝛿 d ∕ 13 ≈ 6 nm . 15 Parameter Description Value Source 𝐾 sD Dissociation constant for crosslinker binding from solution to a single filament 7 . 82nM [ 5 ] 𝐾 dD Dissociation constant for crosslinker binding from solution to two filaments 𝐾 sD ∕5 [ 𝑋 ] Crosslinker concentration 12nM [ 5 ] 𝛿 d Spacing between crosslinker binding sites in overlapping actin filaments 36nm [ 26 ] 𝛿 s Spacing between actin monomers 2𝛿 d 13 ≈ 6nm [ 26 ] 𝑇 Temperature 300 [ 5 ] 𝑁 sca Number of scaffold ring filaments 2 to 8 𝑁 f Total number of force - generating filaments 2 to 8 𝑁 o Number of overlaps 2𝑁 f − 𝑁 sca 𝐸𝐼 Bending rigidity of an actin filament 3 . 6 × 10 26 Nm 2 [ 27 ] 𝐿 f Filament length 1 to 6 µ m 𝑘 Spring constant of a crosslinker 1 . 0 to 2 . 0pNnm −1 𝐷 s Diffusion coefficient of singly bound anillin 8 . 8 × 10 −3 µ m 2 s −1 [ 5 ] 𝜂 Viscosity of water 8 . 9 × 10 −4 Nsm −2 [ 25 ] 𝛾 ‖ End - correction coefficient for the parallel translation diffusion coefficient of a rod −0 . 114 [ 22 , 23 ] ⌀ f Diameter of an actin filament 8nm [ 22 ] Table S1 . Parameters used in calculations . Three studies have measured a dissociation constant for anillin with actin . Matsuda et al . [ 31 ] reported a value of 1 . 2 µ M , while Jananji et al . [ 2 ] reported an even weaker value of 4 . 3 µ M . For comparison , in the original study of force generation via passive crosslinkers , Ase1 was found to bind to microtubules with dissociation constants three orders of magnitude smaller , in the nM range . In both of the experiments of Matsuda et al . [ 31 ] and Jananji et al . [ 2 ] to measure 𝐾 dD , anillin may be binding one or more actin filaments , and so it is not a true measure of 𝐾 dD , which is specifically for anillin binding in the overlap between two actin filaments . The measured dissociation constant is likely an overestimate of the true 𝐾 dD ( i . e . an underestimate of the binding affinity ) . Kučera et al . [ 5 ] indeed report a much smaller value of 7 . 82 nM for 𝐾 sD , which was measured by imaging filaments and crosslinkers that were fluorescently labeled . Because their method is more direct and specifi - cally measures 𝐾 sD , we weight this value much more heavily than the other two reported values . 𝐾 dD will be smaller than 𝐾 sD , but without any data on how much more strongly the crosslinkers bind in an overlap region , we chose to use as a first estimate for 𝐾 dD the same ratio of the dissociation constants of Ase1 between a single microtubule and in an overlap region , 𝐾 dD = 𝐾 sD ∕ 5 . Unbinding rates are known to be affected by the applica - tion of force to one of the binding partners , thus in princi - ple making the dissociation constant a function of the ring - constriction force [ 32 ] . With an energy landscape reducible to a 1D order parameter with a single transition state , a very simple model of the force dependence of the unbinding rate assumes a constant force that tilts the energy landscape , but without changing the relative distance between the well of the bound state and the transition state [ 32 , 33 ] . With this model , the force - dependent off - rate can be written as 𝑘 off ( 𝐹 ) = 𝑘 off ( 0 ) exp ( 𝐹𝑥 𝛽 𝑘 B 𝑇 ) , ( S46 ) where 𝐹 is the applied force , 𝑘 off ( 0 ) is the off - rate with no applied force , and 𝑥 𝛽 is the distance from the well to the transition state . To get a rough idea of the magnitude of this effect on the constriction force calculated with our model , we can use the force near the maximum ring ra - dius with 𝑁 sca = 2 , 𝑁 f = 8 , and 𝐿 f = 3 . 0 µ m , which is around 3 pN . A value for 𝑘 off ( 0 ) of anillin binding to a single actin filament is reported in Ref . [ 5 ] ( 0 . 06 s −1 ) . While 𝑥 𝛽 is not known , it is likely on the order of a few angstroms [ 34 ] . If we take the worst - case scenario and set 𝑥 𝛽 = 1 nm , and assume the crosslinkers experience the full ring tension that results from the constriction force of 3 pN , 0 . 5 pN , ( rather than the tension divided by the number of crosslinkers ) , then the dissociation constant only marginally increases , from 𝐾 sD = 7 . 82 nM in the absence of any force to 𝐾 s D ( 𝐹 ) = 8 . 77 nM . Plugging this back into Eq . 4 of the main text , the constriction force changes by only 2 % , even in this worst - case scenario . Combined with the fact that a decrease in the constriction force can essentially be com - pensated for by shifting the crosslinker concentration , we chose not to include this effect in our model , which would have significantly increased its complexity , as it would have to be solved iteratively . APPENDIX Starting from the same assumptions as the main text , we give an alternative derivation for the relationship between the friction coefficient for ring constriction 𝜁 R and the fric - tion coefficient of a single overlap 𝜁 . To begin , consider the 16 dynamics of the total overlap in the ring , d𝐿 tot = [ 𝐹 tot 𝜁 tot + d d𝐿 tot ( 𝑘 B 𝑇 𝜁 tot ) ] d𝑡 + √ 2𝑘 B 𝑇 𝜁 tot d𝑊 , ( S47 ) where 𝐹 tot is the total linear force on the overlaps and 𝜁 tot is the friction coefficient for the change in the total overlap . If we approximate the dynamics of the total overlap as the sum of the dynamics of each individual overlap , then d𝐿 tot d𝑡 = 𝑁 o ∑ 𝑖 d𝐿 𝑖 d𝑡 ( S48a ) = 𝑁 o ∑ 𝑖 𝐹 𝑖 𝜁 𝑖 ( S48b ) = 1 𝜁 𝑁 o ∑ 𝑖 𝐹 𝑖 ( S48c ) = 𝐹 tot 𝜁 , ( S48d ) where 𝜁 𝑖 is the friction coefficient of overlap 𝑖 , but we assume 𝜁 𝑖 = 𝜁 , i . e . the friction coefficient is the same for all overlaps , which is reasonable if they have the same amount of overlap . Having identified that 𝜁 tot = 𝜁 , we can than apply the chain rule and Eq . 2 of the main text to write the radial ring - constriction dynamics in terms of 𝜁 , d𝑅 d𝑡 = d𝑅 d𝐿 d𝐿 d𝐿 tot d𝐿 tot d𝑡 ( S49a ) = −𝑁 sca 2𝜋 1 𝑁 o 𝐹 tot 𝜁 ( S49b ) = 𝑁 sca 2𝜋𝑁 o 𝜁 d𝑈 d𝑅 d𝑅 d𝐿 ( S49c ) = 𝑁 2sca 4𝜋 2 𝑁 o 𝐹 R 𝜁 , ( S49d ) which implies 𝜁 R = 4𝜋 2 𝑁 o 𝑁 2sca 𝜁 . ( S50 ) We thus recover the same expression for 𝜁 R as derived in Eq . ( S13 ) . Assuming a ring with perfectly circular geometry implies that a change in the radius leads to a simultaneous change in all the overlaps in the ring . Such a mechanism would im - ply a single collective jump of all involved overlaps , which would require the crossing of a much higher free - energy barrier . In reality , the ring is not perfectly circular , and the filaments will be locally deformed . With local deformation , paths to filament sliding and ring constriction are possible in which only a single overlap changes at a time . The approx - imation made in Eq . ( S48b ) is equivalent to assuming that the dynamics can be described with only these paths and that the local deformations are small enough to be ignored . ∗ alex @ cumberworth . org † tenwolde @ amolf . nl [ 1 ] A .

Semi - log plot of the radial constriction force as a function of the anillin concentration with 𝑁 f = 8 and 𝑁 sca = 2 . The different coloured curves correspond to different values of 𝑅 , expressed in the plot as a fraction of the maximal constriction , ranging from 0 . 6𝑅 max to 𝑅 max in increments of 0 . 1𝑅 max . The constriction force is maximal at [ X ] = 𝐾 sD , which is marked on the plot , along with the experimental crosslinker concentration [ X ] exp [ 5 ] .

Equilibrium radius as a function of the filament length . ( a ) 𝑅 eq is plotted for three values of 𝑁 sca , with 𝑁 f = 8 . ( b ) 𝑅 eq is plotted for a range of 𝑁 f values , with 𝑁 sca = 2 . To understand the end points of the curves , we must consider Fig . 2 ( b ) ( v ) of the main text : at smaller filament lengths , 𝑅 eq ( the blue stars ) approaches 𝑅 max , while at larger filament lengths , 𝑅 eq approaches 𝑅 min . Thus , the left endpoints , where 𝐿 f is small , occur when the bending force equals the sliding force at 𝑅 max , while the right end points , where 𝐿 f is large , occur when the two forces are instead equal at 𝑅 min . Data for all plots was produced with the parameters given in Table S1 . 19 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 𝑅 / µ m ( i ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 𝜙 R ( ii ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s − 2 . 3 − 2 . 2 𝐹 c o n d / p N ( iii ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 𝐹 b e n d / p N ( iv ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s − 1 . 0 − 0 . 5 0 . 0 𝐹 / p N ( v ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 10 −6 10 −4 𝜁 / s k g − 1 ( vi ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 𝑅 / µ m ( i ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 0 . 5 1 . 0 𝜙 R ( ii ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s − 4 − 3 − 2 − 1 𝐹 c o n d / p N ( iii ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 1 2 3 4 𝐹 b e n d / p N ( iv ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s − 2 − 1 0 𝐹 / p N ( v ) 0 500 1000 𝑡 / s 10 −6 10 −4 𝜁 / s k g − 1 ( vi ) ( a ) 𝑘 = 1 . 0 pNnm −1 𝑘 = 1 . 5 pNnm −1 𝑘 = 2 . 0 pNnm −1 ( b ) 𝑁 f = 2 𝑁 f = 3 𝑁 f = 4 𝑁 f = 5 𝑁 f = 6 𝑁 f = 7 𝑁 f = 8 1 Figure S8 . Ring constriction trajectories with 𝐿 f = 3 . 0 µ m . In both ( a ) and ( b ) , the plots are of ( i ) the ring radius 𝑅 , ( ii ) the progress of radial constriction from its maximum ( 𝜙 = 0 ) to its equilibrium value ( 𝜙 = 1 ) , where 𝜙 R = ( 𝑅 max −𝑅 ) ∕ ( 𝑅 max −𝑅 eq ) ; ( iii ) the condensation force 𝐹 cond , ( iv ) the bending force 𝐹 bend , ( v ) the total force 𝐹 , and ( vi ) the friction coefficient of an overlap in the ring 𝜁 . ( a ) Ring constriction trajectories with 𝑁 sca = 2 , 𝑁 f = 5 , and three values of 𝑘 . The ring is able to reach the equilibrium radius for a range of values under 𝑘 = 2 . 0pNnm −1 , although going as low as 𝑘 = 1 . 0pNnm −1 produces dynamics faster than observed in the experiments . ( b ) Ring constriction trajectories with 𝑁 sca = 2 , 𝑘 = 1 . 5pNnm −1 and 𝑁 f ranging from 2 to 8 . With 𝑁 f ≤ 3 , the noise is large , but otherwise , the noise is small , and the dynamics are largely similar for different values of 𝑁 f . The dynamics were solved with an adaptive , stability - optimized stochastic Runge - Kutta method [ 35 – 37 ] using the parameters given in Table S1 .
