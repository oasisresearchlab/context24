EGF receptor trafﬁcking : consequences for signaling and cancer Alejandra Tomas , Clare E . Futter , and Emily R . Eden University College London ( UCL ) Institute of Ophthalmology , London , UK The ligand - stimulated epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) has been extensively studied in the analysis of molecular mechanisms regulating endocytic trafﬁc and the role of that trafﬁc in signal transduction . Although such studies have largely focused on mitogenic signal - ing and dysregulated trafﬁc in tumorigenesis , there is growing interest in the potential role of EGFR trafﬁc in cell survival and the consequent response to cancer therapy . Here we review recent advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating ligand - stimulated EGFR activation , internalization , and post - endocytic sorting . The role of EGFR overexpression / mutation and new modulators of EGFR trafﬁc in cancer and the response to cancer therapeutics are also dis - cussed . Finally , we speculate on the relationship between EGFR trafﬁc and cell survival . Overview of EGFR signaling regulation EGFR plays key roles in essential cellular functions in - cluding proliferation and migration . However , its aberrant activity in the pathogenesis of human cancers underlies our need to understand the complex regulation of EGFR activity and downstream signaling events . Widely consid - ered as the prototypic receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) , EGFR endocytic trafﬁc and regulation has been the subject of considerable scrutiny but although enormous advances have been made our understanding remains incomplete . The prevailing consensus has historically viewed endo - cytic transport of activated RTKs as a means of signal attenuation . This view is supported by the enhanced EGF - stimulated mitogenic signaling and proliferation in cells expressing either a non - internalizing mutant EGFR [ 1 ] or a dynamin mutant that prevents clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis [ 2 ] . Moreover , EGF - stimulated MAPK ( mitogen - activated protein kinase ) signaling was found to occur primarily at the plasma membrane , independently of dynamin activity [ 3 ] . However , a more complex picture of multifaceted , spatial , and temporal regulation is emerg - ing . EGFR can be activated by ligand - independent mech - anisms as well as by multiple ligands , often with differing signaling outcomes ( Figure 1 ) . Moreover , although the majority of EGFR signaling is believed to occur at the plasma membrane [ 3 , 4 ] , activated EGFR - mediated sig - nals can continue from endosomes , suggesting distinct signaling pathways exist that actively require EGFR en - docytosis [ 2 , 5 ] . This review addresses the regulation of EGFR endocytic trafﬁcking and the consequences of this regulation for the spatiotemporal control of signaling and cell fate in normal conditions , as well as in tumorigenesis and the response to cancer therapy . Ligand - stimulated EGFR activation To date eight EGFR ligands have been described . Crystal - lography studies have revealed that ligand - mediated EGFR activation is achieved by a conformational change in the extracellular domain of the receptor upon ligand binding , resulting in receptor dimerization and internali - zation [ 6 ] . Unliganded EGFR can also be internalized but at a 10 - fold slower rate than EGF - stimulated receptor [ 7 ] , but the dimerization and activation states of these recep - tors are unclear . Crucial to RTK activation is the formation of an asymmetric dimer of kinase domains [ 8 ] . Recent data have implicated cytohesins , guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ADP - ribosylation factors , in this process [ 9 ] , and cytohesin - mediated conformational modiﬁcation of EGF - bound receptor dimers from the cytoplasmic side is reported to increase RTK activity . The EGFR has also been shown to ﬂuctuate between monomer and dimer states , even in the absence of ligand , but ligand binding was found to promote dimerization and be required for signaling [ 10 ] . Consistent with this , it has recently been proposed that EGFR autoinhibition in the absence of EGF exists when the receptor is on the plasma membrane , and is relieved by interaction between transmembrane helices on ligand binding or under conditions of very high receptor expression [ 11 ] . Other factors implicated in the regulation of EGFR activation include association with ﬂotillins at the plasma membrane [ 12 ] and interaction with Ca 2 + / calmodulin complexes via the calmodulin - binding domain at the cytosolic juxtamembrane region of the EGFR [ 13 ] . Active EGFR dimers undergo autophosphorylation of tyro - sine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor . Con - sequently , phosphotyrosine - binding proteins are recruited , activating multiple signal transduction pathways , includ - ing the MAPK signaling cascade , the phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) pathway , which recruits Akt / PKB to the plasma membrane , and the phospholipase C g pathway , Review 0962 - 8924 / $ – see front matter (cid:2) 2013 Elsevier Ltd .

Ligand - stimulated EGFR endocytosis : a positive and negative regulator of signaling Signaling from activated EGFR , including the MAPK sig - naling cascade as well as PI3K activation , occurs mostly from the plasma membrane [ 3 , 4 ] , and endocytosis is thought to initiate termination of the signal . However , internalization of activated EGFR also enables speciﬁc signaling pathways from intracellular sites , and endocytic trafﬁcking of EGFRs is required for optimal activation of a subset of signal transducers [ 2 ] . The clathrin adaptor protein complex AP2 Some controversy exists over the mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis . The involvement of the clathrin adaptor pro - tein complex AP2 in EGFR endocytosis has been the subject of debate following conﬂicting reports of the effects of small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated depletion of AP2 on EGFR endocytosis [ 15 , 16 ] . Interaction between EGFR and the m 2 subunit of AP2 has been demonstrated ( reviewed in [ 17 ] ) . Moreover , the AP2 b 2 subunit becomes tyrosine - phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation , a process dependent on the dileucine motif in the EGFR carboxyl terminus [ 18 ] . Mutation of this motif , however , did not affect EGFR endocytosis , but targeting of the receptor for degradation was disrupted , suggesting that either the EGFR dileucine motif or AP2 b 2 phosphorylation might facilitate the recruitment of downstream sorting machin - ery . Taken together , these studies suggest that although AP2 is not an absolute requirement of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) of the EGFR its interaction with EGFR and role in recruiting other components of the endocytic machinery can facilitate endocytosis and the passage of activated EGFR through the endocytic pathway . Grb2 and EGFR ubiquitination Another EGFR - binding adaptor protein is growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 ( Grb2 ) , which binds activated EGFR through its Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain [ 19 ] . This interaction mediates apparently opposing effects on sig - naling : downregulation through internalization and ubi - quitination - targeted degradation but also activation of signaling cascades through interaction of Grb2 SH3 domains with the Ras guanine exchange factor , son of sevenless homolog ( SOS ) [ 20 ] . Grb2 recruits the E3 ubi - quitin ligase Cbl , resulting in monomeric and polymeric ubiquitination on lysine residues in the kinase domain of the EGFR [ 21 ] as well as modiﬁcation with monomers of the ubiquitin - like molecule NEDD8 ( neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 ) [ 22 ] . Interaction with the GTP - bound active form of Ras results in Raf activation and initiation of the MAPK signaling EE : Early endosome MVB : Mul(cid:2)vesicular body Key : ERC : Endocy(cid:2)c recycling compartment N : Nucleus M : Mitochondria L : Lysosome Clathrin - coated pit Cell fate arrow EGFR dimer Established traﬃcking route Proposed traﬃcking route Degraded EGFR M Cellular homeostasis Cell death Prolifera(cid:2)on EE MVB L N ERC Stress : - UV - Oxida(cid:2)ve stress - Chemotherapy drugs ( cispla(cid:2)n ) - γ - radia(cid:2)on Type VIII mutant Oncogenic mutants TGF α - s(cid:2)mulated EGF - s(cid:2)mulated Stress - ac(cid:2)vated Ac(cid:2)vated EFGRs : C TRENDS in Cell Biology Figure 1 . EGF receptor ( EGFR ) trafficking pathways and associated outcomes . Activated cell - surface EGFRs are internalized and sorted at the early endosome . The fate of the receptor has important consequences for biological cell outputs , with the recycling pathway favoring cell proliferation ( depicted green ) , although the degradative pathway via ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) - mediated sorting within multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) / lysosomes correlates with normal cellular homeostasis ( depicted in blue ) . Atypical trafficking pathways to the nucleus and mitochondria have also been described and are proposed to favor survival , but the transport mechanisms are not well established . Exposure to stress leads to the removal of the receptor from the cell surface , and this has been proposed to potentiate cell death ( depicted in red ) . Conversely , stress - activated receptor might also be recycled , thereby promoting cell survival and / or proliferation .

PI3K activation is also mediated by interaction of Grb2 and Gab1 [ 23 ] , and functions in a positive feedback loop , producing PI3 , 4 , 5P 3 , which targets Gab1 to the plasma membrane in response to EGF stimulation , where direct Gab1 – EGFR interaction potentiates MAPK activation [ 24 ] . EGFR ubiquitination is recognized by ubiquitin - binding proteins of the clathrin coat , including the AP2 - interacting proteins epsin1 and Eps15 . Although ubiquitination has been reported to facilitate recruitment of activated EGFR to clathrin - coated pits and promote CME [ 25 , 26 ] , a recep - tor lacking 15 lysine residues in the kinase domain is negligibly ubiquitinated but is internalized normally [ 27 ] . Moreover , EGFR CME was largely unaffected by epsin1 or Eps15 depletion [ 28 , 29 ] , although impaired in - ternalization because of epsin1 depletion was also reported [ 30 ] . The extent of the contribution of ubiquitination and ubiquitination - dependent effectors ( such as epsin and Eps15 ) to EGFR internalization may depend on cell type and physiological conditions . A recent study , mutating 21 lysine residues , three of which were found to be acetylated , resulted in impaired internalization [ 1 ] , raising the in - triguing possibility that acetylation might be required for EGFR dimerization , similarly to STAT3 [ 31 ] and the prolactin receptor . Dimerization is crucial for ligand - stim - ulated EGFR autophosphorylation , activation , and inter - nalization , with the exception of constitutively active mutant receptors ( see ‘EGFR oncogenic mutations’ , below ) . Interestingly the dimerization state of EGFR activated ligand - independently has not yet been established . Using multiple EGFR mutations deﬁcient in ubiquitination , acet - ylation , and interaction with AP - 2 and Grb2 , Goh et al . [ 1 ] concluded that regulation of CME of the EGFR is complex , involving a combination of all of the above factors func - tioning both redundantly and cooperatively . Clathrin - independent EGFR endocytosis CME offers a rapid internalization pathway , but slower clathrin - independent mechanisms have also been reported , and ligand concentration is thought to be important in directing receptor passage through the endocytic pathway . High EGF concentrations ( 20 ng / ml ) were found to promote clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) [ 32 ] in an epsin and eps15 - dependent manner [ 33 ] , possibly due to saturation of the clathrin - mediated pathway . Surprisingly , this study found that CME promoted EGFR recycling with prolonged signaling as a consequence . Consistent with this , Dynamin2 mutants were found to reduce CIE of EGFR without affect - ing uptake of transferrin receptor , resulting in reduced EGFR degradation [ 34 ] . Recently a Grb2 / Cbl - dependent ubiquitin threshold was described that correlates with EGFR CIE and downregulation of signal transduction , al - though exactly how ubiquitination and CIE are coupled remains unclear [ 35 ] . It should be noted that CIE of EGFR remains controversial because , in separate studies , clathrin depletion was found to inhibit EGFR endocytosis even at high ligand concentrations , with the disparity being attributed to the relative efﬁciencies of clathrin depletion [ 36 , 37 ] . The type of activating ligand itself is also important . Receptor activation by different ligands , EGF or transform - ing growth factor ( TGF - a ) , resulted in CME alone whereas the most potent activators of EGFR , heparin - binding EGF - like growth factor ( HB - EGF ) and betacellulin ( BTC ) , stimu - lated both clathrin - mediated and clathrin - independent mechanisms [ 37 ] . The authors suggested that , although this could be due to more efﬁcient recruitment of residual cla - thrin following this potent activation in clathrin - depleted cells , an alternative as yet unidentiﬁed internalization pathway might be employed under these conditions . Pro - posed mechanisms of CIE include uptake via caveolae [ 38 ] or via macropinocytosis , as observed in response to EGF stim - ulation in A - 431 cells [ 39 ] , or in response to antibody binding in porcine aortic endothelial cells [ 40 ] . Thus , a growing body of evidence is emerging in support of a clathrin - independent , dynamin2 - dependent mechanism of internalization of EGFR that may operate under particular physiological conditions , perhaps involving saturation of the clathrin machinery or a cellular response to potent RTK activation ( by ligand type or concentration ) , resulting in increased trafﬁc along the degradative pathway to maintain signal homeostasis . Post - endocytic EGFR sorting Two major destinations exist for EGFR trafﬁcking from early endosomes : recycling to the cell surface or lysosomal degradation . A delicate equilibrium between these two pathways balances continued signaling both from endo - somes and recycled EGFR at the cell surface against signal attenuation in the degradative pathway . Furthermore , subcompartmentalization of signaling has been shown to occur within the endocytic pathway . A subpopulation of early endosomes has been described that are positive for the Rab5 effector APPL1 , which was found to regulate AKT activity from early endosomes [ 41 ] . Moreover , the Regula - tor complex , comprising LAMTOR - 1 , - 2 , and - 3 , which interacts with MEK1 / ERK1 , regulates continued EGF - dependent MAPK signaling from late endosomes and lyso - somes , and promotes in vivo proliferation [ 42 ] . Receptor ubiquitination and ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) - mediated sorting within multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) As well as being recognized by components of the endo - cytic machinery at the plasma membrane , receptor ubi - quitination is crucial to sorting activated EGFR at the endosome ( [ 43 ] for review ) . The ESCRT machinery sorts ubiquitinated receptor onto the intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) of maturing endosomes , thereby physically remov - ing the active kinase domain from cytosolic substrates as well as targeting the ubiquitinated receptor for lysosomal degradation . Ubiquitinated receptors are recognized by several ubiquitin interacting motif ( UIM ) - containing pro - teins including the Rab5 exchange factor , Rabex - 5 [ 44 ] , the ESCRT - 0 component , hepatocyte growth - factor regu - lated tyrosine kinase substrate ( Hrs ) , and the ESCRT - I component , tumor susceptibility gene 101 ( Tsg101 ) . In - deed , EGFR ubiquitination is required for its interaction with Hrs and efﬁcient lysosomal targeting [ 45 ] . Hrs in - teraction with the ESCRT - I component , Tsg101 , pro - motes recruitment of subsequent ESCRT complexes , with ESCRT - III - dependent scission completing ILV biogenesis . Before sorting onto ILVs , the ubiquitin is Review Trends in Cell Biology xxx xxxx , Vol . xxx , No . x TICB - 1021 ; No . of Pages 9 3 removed by deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) , and recycled to maintain the free ubiquitin pool . The DUBs AMSH ( associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM ) [ 46 ] and UBPY ( ubiquitin isopeptidase Y / ubiqui - tin - speciﬁc protease 8 ) [ 47 ] , bind both the ESCRT - 0 com - ponent STAM ( signal transducing adaptor molecule ) and ESCRT - III complex members [ 48 ] , and are implicated in regulating EGFR sorting onto the degradative pathway . By contrast , Cezanne - 1 , a DUB that is overexpressed in breast cancer , has recently been reported to prevent EGFR degradation , resulting in enhanced oncogenic signaling [ 49 ] . As an additional level of EGF RTK regu - lation , endocytosed EGFR can be subject to direct dephos - phorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) ( [ 50 ] for review ) , including the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) - localized PTP1B which interacts with endocytosed EGFR at membrane contact sites between the ER and endosomes [ 51 ] ( Box 1 ) . The type 1 g phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase variant i5 ( PIPK1 g i5 ) that phosphor - ylates phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate to produce phos - phatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI4 , 5P 2 ) , was recently shown , together with its binding partner SNX5 ( sorting nexin 5 ) , to play a role in regulating the sorting of activated receptor onto ILVs [ 52 ] . Phosphoinositides play central roles in CME at the plasma membrane [ 53 , 54 ] , but this study suggests additional functions for PI4 , 5P 2 at the endosome . Loss of PIPK1 g i5 or SNX5 blocked EGFR sorting onto ILVs owing to increased Hrs ubiqui - tination , previously shown to prevent Hrs – EGFR inter - action , resulting in enhanced and prolonged signaling . Regulation of EGFR recycling The importance of ubiquitination in targeting activated EGFRs for degradation is established ; negligibly - ubiquiti - nated EGFR mutants that evade the degradative pathway were recently shown to be recycled to the plasma mem - brane [ 45 ] . Thus perhaps recycling might serve as a default pathway . However , the identiﬁcation of several effectors of EGFR recycling suggests a more active and regulated process . Receptor recycling can occur either by the direct Rab4 - and Rab35 - regulated route to the plasma membrane or by a Rab11 - dependent route via the perinuclear endo - cytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) . The calcium - modulat - ing cyclophilin ligand ( CAML ) was reported to associate with the activated EGFR kinase domain , promoting EGF - stimulated receptor recycling [ 55 ] . Recently Eps15S , a short isoform of Eps15 , was identiﬁed that targets endo - cytosed EGFR for recycling through the Rab11 - positive ERC [ 56 ] . In addition , the adaptor protein Odin , a target of Src kinase activity [ 57 ] , was found to promote EGF - stimulated receptor recycling [ 58 ] . Although increased recycling is predicted to prolong signaling , Odin has also been described as a negative regulator of EGFR signaling [ 59 ] . This apparent contradiction is yet to be explained but may involve downstream Odin - mediated suppression of signaling pathways . Other factors affecting the passage of EGFR through the endocytic pathway include Hrs phosphorylation and AMSH - mediated deubiquitination of the receptor , and loss of Hrs phosphorylation and AMSH activity are asso - ciated with increased EGFR recycling [ 46 ] . The activating ligand can also direct EGFR trafﬁc , depending on the pH - dependent stability of ligand – receptor interactions [ 60 ] . EGF binding , for example , remains stable at the reduced pH in endosomes , allowing targeting to the degradative pathway , whereas TGF - a dissociates at endosomal pH . The consequent deubiquitination upon dissociation allows the receptor to escape lysosomal targeting , and instead be recycled to the plasma membrane , consistent with the increased mitogenic effects of TGF - a [ 61 ] . Furthermore , the EGFR dimerization partners can also dictate its fate . As well as forming homodimers , EGFRs can form hetero - dimers with other EGFR family members . Whereas on EGF stimulation EGFR homodimers are sorted for degra - dation , heterodimers fail to recruit Cbl , thereby evading degradation and are instead recycled . For example , EGFR / ERBB2 heterodimers , that are overexpressed in many human tumors , are internalized at a slower rate , with increased recycling to the cell surface [ 62 ] . Alternative fates for endocytosed EGFR Sorting of activated EGFR for lysosomal degradation ( and therefore attenuation of signaling ) or recycling to the Box 1 . PTP1B : paradoxical roles in EGFR downregulation and tumorigenesis The protein tyrosine phosphatase , PTP1B , is tyrosine phosphory - lated ( Y66 ) by activated EGFR , resulting in a threefold increase in its catalytic activity [ 99 ] . Moreover , ER - localized PTP1B has also been shown to both interact with and dephosphorylate activated endocytosed EGFR [ 100 ] . How this ER - localized phosphatase might interact with activated EGFR on the endocytic pathway was resolved by the identification of membrane contact sites ( MCSs ) , regions of close membrane apposition ( < 20 nm ) , between the ER and endo - somes [ 51 ] . In addition to its role in EGFR dephosphorylation , PTP1B activity also promotes the formation of ILVs and the lysosomal targeting of activated EGFR , likely via its dephosphorylation of the ESCRT - 0 components Hrs and STAM [ 51 , 101 ] . Thus PTP1B activity is able to modulate both endocytic cargo and machinery , with downregulation of RTK signaling and therefore suppression of tumor development being the predicted outcome of its activity . Consistent with a tumor - suppressor role , genetic ablation of PTP1B in p53 - null mice resulted in accelerated lymphomagenesis [ 102 ] , and increased ligand - stimulated phosphorylation of the EGFR was observed in PTP1B - null mouse fibroblasts [ 103 ] . Surprisingly , however , PTP1B knockout mice do not develop tumors and , although EGF - stimulated EGFR phosphorylation is increased , cell proliferation is not [ 104 ] . Indeed , PTP1B loss was found to diminish Ras activity through increased p62Dok phosphorylation [ 105 ] , suggesting a potentially oncogenic role for PTP1B . This was confirmed when PTP1B activity was shown to promote ErbB2 - dependent mammary tumorigenesis [ 104 , 106 ] . Activation of c - Src by PTP1B - mediated dephosphorylation of the inhibitory Y530 site [ 107 ] could account for tumorigenic effects of PTP1B activity [ 104 ] . Src kinase can interact with and phosphorylate RTKs including EGFR , and regulate proliferation through the Erk / MAP kinase pathway [ 108 ] ; overexpression or increased activation of Src is found in several cancers including breast and colon cancers and is frequently linked with high EGFR levels [ 109 ] . In addition , PTP1B has recently been shown to promote the progression of prostate cancer [ 110 ] , adding further evidence of a role for PTP1B activity in tumorigenesis and making it an attractive target for cancer therapy . PTP1B plays a pivotal role in the regulation of insulin and leptin , and is a target for diabetes therapies ; small - molecule inhibitors of PTP1B have been developed which could have potential application to cancer therapy . However , further understanding of the mechanism and regulation of PTP1B activity is necessary before it can be exploited for therapeutic benefit .

Howev - er , alternative fates for activated EGFRs are emerging , including trafﬁc to both the nucleus and the mitochondria . Nuclear EGFR , that is reported to depend on the nuclear localization sequence within the EGFR juxtamembrane region that interacts with importin - b , has been proposed to act as a transcriptional regulator and modulator of DNA repair through interaction with DNA - dependent protein kinase ( DNA - PK ) . Proposed mechanisms of nuclear trans - location are further detailed in Box 2 and reviewed in [ 63 ] . There is , however , a large pool of literature analyzing EGFR trafﬁcking that does not report EGFR trans - port to the nucleus , and the exact mechanisms of nuclear translocation remain controversial . EGFR transport to the mitochondria , both constitutive and in response to a range of stimuli , has also been reported , although the role of CME is unclear , and both CME - dependent [ 64 ] and endocytosis - independent mechanisms [ 65 ] have been reported . Mito - chondrial EGFR was found to directly phosphorylate cytochrome c oxidase subunit II ( CoxII ) , involved in regu - lating apoptosis , in a c - Src - dependent manner , with reduced Cox activity and cellular ATP being reported [ 64 ] , and a role in drug resistance has further been suggested [ 66 ] . However , the mechanism of translocation to the mito - chondria and indeed the function of mitochondrial EGFR remain to be fully deﬁned . Thus , in addition to the comparatively well - studied recycling and degradative trafﬁcking pathways of endocy - tosed EGFR , alternative fates for the EGFR , including translocation to the nucleus ( Box 2 ) and mitochondria , have been reported , and further studies will be necessary to elucidate the nature and regulation of the transport mechanisms involved . EGFR trafﬁcking and cancer Abnormal expression and dysregulated intracellular traf - ﬁcking of the EGFR family of RTKs play important and well - recognized roles in oncogenesis . Mutations of EGFR have been identiﬁed in several types of cancer [ 67 – 69 ] , and the EGFR is the target for an expanding class of anticancer therapies ( reviewed in [ 70 ] ) . Trafﬁcking defects resulting in mislocalization and poor downregulation of the EGFR are associated with enhanced signaling [ 71 ] , which can lead to the development of cancer [ 72 ] . Here we describe the different mechanisms by which modulations in EGFR trafﬁcking and function can lead to oncogenesis or alter the outcome of antineoplastic therapies . EGFR oncogenic mutations : trafﬁcking defects Overexpression and particular oncogenic mutations of EGFR lead to spontaneous dimerization of the receptor , resulting in receptor activation [ 73 ] . Two main types of mutant EGFRs have been identiﬁed in tumorigenesis , both of which are constitutively active : truncated EGFR mutants and those harboring mutations in the kinase domain [ 74 ] . A range of constitutively - active oncogenic EGFR mutants found in non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) trafﬁc into the ERC , allowing them to engage in a preferential interaction with Src , a crucial partner for EGFR - mediated oncogenesis [ 75 ] . Synergy between Src and EGFR also occurs because these two kinases trafﬁc together , and their colocalization promotes EGFR - mediated signaling [ 76 ] . Interestingly , the NSCLC - associated EGFR mutants appear to be impaired in their interaction with Cbl , resulting in their defective ubiquitination and degradation , contributing to their prolonged signaling [ 77 ] . However , the most common EGFR variant in glioblastoma , EGFR type VIII , which harbors a deletion of 267 amino acids in the extracellular domain – leading to a receptor that is unable to bind ligand but is constitutively active [ 78 ] – is downregu - lated after Cbl - mediated ubiquitination [ 79 ] . Role of oncogenes in the modulation of EGFR trafﬁcking Several oncogenes have been proposed to exert their action by affecting EGFR trafﬁcking . One such oncogene , the Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2 , known to regulate cell adhesion , motility , spreading , and prolifer - ation in response to growth factor signaling , has been shown to delay EGFR internalization and degradation , and enhance EGFR , ERK , and Akt phosphorylation [ 80 ] . Another oncogene , activated Cdc42 - associated Kinase ACK1 , is a non - RTK that can integrate signals from nu - merous interacting partners , including Cdc42 and EGFR [ 81 ] . ACK1 interacts with ubiquitinated EGFR to facilitate Box 2 . Potential mechanisms for nuclear translocation of endocytosed EGFR Potential mechanisms for the translocation of full - length EGFR to the nucleoplasm are beginning to emerge . The recovery of EGFR in ER fractions following prolonged EGF stimulation [ 111 ] was the first indication that a subset of EGFR might follow the retrograde pathway from the endosomes to the ER that is taken by some endocytosed toxins . The retromer protein complex participates in the retrieval of proteins from the endosome to the Golgi , and binds phosphatidyli - nositol 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI3 , 5P 2 ) , a lipid synthesized by PIKfyve . PIKfyve dysfunction impairs endosome – Golgi transport , and a role for this pathway in nuclear transport is supported by the inhibition of ligand - stimulated EGFR trafficking to the nucleus in human bladder cancer cells in which PIKfyve function is impaired [ 112 ] . The COP1 coat protein complex mediates retrograde transport through the Golgi and to the ER , and depletion of COP1 was also recently shown to inhibit EGF - stimulated transport of EGFR to the nucleus [ 113 ] . EGF - stimulated retrograde transport of EGFR to the Golgi and subsequent translocation to the nucleus were also reported to depend on a membrane fusion event driven by the SNARE protein syntaxin 6 and on dynein - dependent transport along microtubules [ 114 ] . A role for the Sec61 translocon , Sec61 b , in EGFR translocation from the ER to the cytoplasm has been proposed , with nuclear translocation of EGF - stimulated EGFR being inhibited by depletion of Sec61 b [ 111 ] . Whether Sec61 b is also involved in EGFR nuclear translocation following ligand - independent stimulation is unknown , and how the EGFR is recognized by this machinery and the molecular detail of the retrotranslocation remain unclear . Membrane extraction of EGFR at the ER implies that EGFR must pass through the cytosol before nuclear import . The hydrophobic transmembrane domain of the EGFR suggests the involvement of molecular chaperones , but how the retrotranslocated EGFR escapes proteasomal degradation has yet to be demonstrated . A way to avoid the conundrum presented by soluble EGFR in the cytoplasm is suggested by a recent study reporting the presence of Sec61 and EGFR on the inner nuclear membrane [ 115 ] . Entry into the nucleus has been reported to involve association of the nuclear localization sequence of EGFR with importins [ 116 ] , proteins required for the import of macromolecules through the nuclear pore complex , but the mechanism regulating this transport remains unclear .

A single somatic mutation in ACK1 that abrogates ubiquitin binding can stabilize the EGFR at the plasma membrane [ 83 ] , thereby prolonging mitogenic signaling after EGF stimulation and making some cancers resistant to EGFR kinase inhibitors such as geﬁtinib . Another example of the importance of trafﬁcking regula - tion in tumorigenesis is the interaction between the tumor suppressors PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin homolog ) and SPRY2 ( sprouty homolog 2 ) . Reduced SPRY2 expression causes hyperactivation of PI3K / AKT signaling in a PTEN - dependent manner , resulting in increased cell pro - liferation and invasion in prostate cancer [ 84 ] . The conse - quent positive feedback results in increased EGFR internalization and sustained signaling at the early endo - some , in a mechanism involving activation of the stress - inducible p38 MAPK by PI3K . As previously described [ 85 , 86 ] , activated p38 facilitates clathrin - mediated EGFR internalization and evasion of degradation , and this allows the sustained signaling observed at early endosomes . The examples above illustrate the conﬂicting role of EGFR trafﬁc in signaling , with endocytosis resulting in either positive or negative effects on signaling and tumori - genesis , which is most likely due to complex interactions between EGFR and its downstream effectors . Anti - EGFR targeting drugs and combination therapies Chemoradiotherapy , the combined treatment with two DNA - damaging agents , namely ionizing radiation and an alkylating agent such as cisplatin , is the standard choice of treatment for many cancers . Applying a combina - tion of X - rays or chemotherapy and EGFR - targeting drugs of low general toxicity may enhance the lethal effect of local irradiation and / or revert tumor resistance [ 61 ] . To date , two different categories of compounds targeting EGFR have shown antitumor activity : monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ; e . g . , cetuximab ) and low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ; e . g . , geﬁtinib ) , which target extra - cellular and intracellular domains of the receptor , respec - tively [ 87 ] . Geﬁtinib has previously been shown to efﬁciently sup - press ligand - stimulated endocytosis of EGFR in some cell types but not in others [ 88 ] . Cetuximab was been found to be internalized as an antibody – receptor complex with EGFR even though binding of the antibody prevents stim - ulation of EGFR by endogenous ligands , leading to overall downregulation of EGFR expression [ 89 ] . The effects of EGFR - directed antineoplastic therapies on its intracellu - lar trafﬁcking in conjunction with receptor activity have however not been clearly established and require further investigation . Secondary effects of antineoplastic therapies on EGFR trafﬁcking and activation Another aspect of the regulation of EGFR trafﬁcking that is likely to play a key role in cancer development and patient outcome is the effect of current cancer therapies on EGFR trafﬁc . Both X - rays and chemotherapy treatments are capable of generating reactive oxygen species [ 90 ] that lead to the inactivation of redox - sensitive , cysteine - based protein tyrosine phosphatases [ 91 ] . As a result of the altered equilibrium between basal cellular kinase and phosphatase activities , EGFR becomes phosphorylated and the kinase activity of the receptor is stimulated in a ligand - independent manner [ 92 ] . The EGFR itself can also become directly activated via modiﬁcation of cysteine resi - dues located in its active site [ 93 ] . This activation is accompanied by receptor internalization and elicits endo - cytic trafﬁcking / signaling events that have not been fully characterized but are either p38 - [ 85 , 86 ] or Src - dependent [ 94 , 95 ] , and clathrin - and AP2 adaptor - dependent [ 96 ] . One previous study shows that abrogating p38 - dependent EGFR internalization reduces the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy - induced cell death [ 86 ] . This suggests that EGFR - mediated survival signaling might occur primarily from the plasma membrane , and therefore ligand - independent EGFR inter - nalization would enhance the cytotoxic effect of chemother - apy drugs such as cisplatin . However , in another study cisplatin was shown to induce both p38 - dependent EGFR internalization and EGFR - dependent PKB / Akt activation , leading to cisplatin resistance [ 85 ] . The biological effects of this internalization therefore require further clariﬁcation to determine possible synergistic effects of chemoradiotherapy and EGFR - targeting drugs . Atypical EGFR trafﬁcking in response to chemoradiotherapy Following ionizing radiation treatment , the EGFR has been proposed to directly enter the nucleus and promote DNA - PK - dependent non - homologous end - joining double - strand break DNA repair [ 97 , 98 ] . As described above , the mechanisms involved in this translocation are controver - sial , and several molecular pathways have been postulated ( Box 2 ) . Moreover , whether the effect of EGFR on DNA repair is direct or indirect remains to be established be - cause such a role could be exerted , without entering the nucleus , via signaling platforms such as those found on early endosomes [ 14 ] . In addition , mitochondrial translocation of EGFR has been reported in response to stress and RTK inhibitor treatments , where it could exert anti - apoptotic effects after chemotherapy - induced cell death , therefore contributing to drug resistance [ 66 ] . Concluding remarks Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating EGFR internalization , lysosomal targeting , and recycling ( summarized in Figure 2 ) have increased our knowledge of the role that EGFR localiza - tion plays in the regulation of mitogenic signaling . This ongoing effort improves our awareness of factors underly - ing tumorigenesis and may also identify novel therapeutic targets . A comparatively new and exciting area is the additional role that EGFR activation and trafﬁc may play in regulating responses to cancer therapy . Although there is growing evidence that EGFR signaling plays a role in cell survival and DNA repair in response to chemora - diotherapy , there is very little understanding of the role of internalization and post - endocytic trafﬁc of EGFR in Review Trends in Cell Biology xxx xxxx , Vol . xxx , No . x TICB - 1021 ; No . of Pages 9 6 regulating that response . Determination of the trafﬁcking pathways followed by stress - activated EGFR and the molecular mechanisms regulating that trafﬁc will enable the analysis of the role of EGFR trafﬁc in regulating DNA repair and cell survival . This will open up the prospect of development of future treatment strategies , including the targeting of factors involved in the regulation of cancer therapy - induced EGFR endocytosis and subsequent intra - cellular trafﬁc . In combination with current drugs target - ing the EGFR itself , controlling EGFR trafﬁc could potentiate therapeutic action against tumors resistant to conventional chemoradiotherapy .

Effectors of ligand - stimulated EGF receptor ( EGFR ) trafficking pathways . Ligand binding mediates dimerization of EGFRs at the cell - surface , resulting in autophosphorylation , activation , and internalization . Under normal physiological conditions clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is believed to be the major route of internalization , but clathrin - independent mechanisms have also been reported under conditions of potent activation [ high concentrations of EGF or heparin - binding EGF - like growth factor ( HB - EGF ) / betacellulin ( BTC ) ] . Internalized receptors are sorted at the endosome onto the recycling or degradative pathways , with ubiquitination targeting receptors for lysosomal degradation . Alternative fates reported for endocytosed EGFR , to the nucleus and the mitochondria , are also depicted .
