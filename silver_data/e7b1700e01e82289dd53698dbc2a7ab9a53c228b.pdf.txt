School closures were over - weighted against the mitigation of COVID - 19 transmission A literature review on the impact of school closures in the United States Wanli Tan ∗ Abstract Background : The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has spread wildly across the world . In March of 2020 , almost all kindergarten through 12th grade ( K - 12 ) schools were closed in the United States in an urgent attempt to curb the pandemic in the absence of effective therapeutics or vaccination . Thirteen months since then , schools remain partially closed . Accumulated evidence suggests that children and adolescents are not the primary facilitators of transmission , limiting the restrictive effects of school closures on disease transmission . The negative effects of school closures on K - 12 students need to be systematically reviewed . Methods : Following the guideline of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - analyzes , a comprehensive literature search from PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , Scopus , and Web of Science regarding school closures and its impact on K - 12 students was conducted . The primary outcomes included the impact of school closures on the mitigation of the pandemic and the resulting public health concerns of K - 12 students . Results : Prolonged school closures possessed negative effects on K - 12 students ’ physical , mental , and social well - being and reduced the number of health and social workers , hindering the reopening of the country . Conclusions : School closures were over - weighted against the mitigation of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) transmission . A safe reopening of all K - 12 schools in the United States should be of top priority .

Introduction On January 10th , 2020 , the ﬁ rst case of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) was of ﬁ cially detected in Wuhan , China . Eleven days later , the ﬁ rst case con ﬁ rmed via serological test in the United States was detected on January 21st , 2020 . [ 1 ] In the following 7weeks , the virus infected more than a thousand Americans . [ 2 ] On March 13th , 2020 , the United States declared a national state of emergency to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the virus that causes COVID - 19 . [ 3 ] Thirteen months later , as of April 25th , 2021 , during the revision of this literature review , there were 146 , 721 , 545 con ﬁ rmed cases of SARS - CoV - 2 and 3 , 103 , 555 deaths from the infections globally . 32 , 072 , 187 con ﬁ rmed cases and 572 , 186 deaths were reported in the United States . [ 4 ] School children were anticipated to contribute signi ﬁ cantly to the community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 due to their daily social contacts with peers and household members , leading to severe community morbidity and mortality . [ 5 ] This presumption was based on experience with in ﬂ uenza and other respiratory diseases , [ 6 – 9 ] where children and adolescents were typically at the greatest risk of infection . They transmit the virus to each other and their family members at considerable speed , leading to severe outcomes . [ 10 , 11 ] Presumably , they play an important role in the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 as many affected children were asymptomatic and prolonged fecal viral shedding makes it very dif ﬁ cult for school nurses and health of ﬁ cials to diagnose , trace , and prevent the spread of the virus . [ 12 , 13 ] Therefore , school - aged children and adolescents have been suggested as the drivers of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Data on viral load suggested that they may have similar COVID - 19 viral loads as adults .

[ 15 , 16 ] Amidst the lack of effective therapeutics or vaccination , in response to the pandemic , 191 countries implemented school closures worldwide . [ 17 ] As a result , about 1 . 6 billion ( 90 . 2 % ) students were out of face - to - face elementary , secondary , and tertiary education in order to slow the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . [ 18 , 19 ] Strict public health interventions , such as social distancing , stay - at - home orders , and mandated shutdown had also been introduced to the United States . Kindergarten through 12th grade ( K - 12 ) schools in all 50 states and Washington District of Columbia ( D . C . ) closed in March 2020 in an attempt to curb the pandemic . [ 20 ] With the pandemic unabated and vaccines unapproved , most schools remained closed for the ﬁ rst half of the 2020 to 2021 academic year , indicating that about 40 million prekindergarten through 8th - grade children were unable to enter or return to their classrooms during the ﬁ rst semester . Among them , about 27 million students are pre - K through 5th graders . [ 21 ] Unable to go to school physically , many of them have lost out and will continue to lose out on essential education , health care , and other social resources , which may have long - term negative effects on their development . [ 22 – 24 ] To date , online instruction has been incorporated into the curriculum of most students in the United States for more than 13months . Fortunately , as the knowledge on COVID - 19 has accumulated , clinical and epidemiological evidence showed that most children or adolescents had asymptomatic infections or mild illnesses from COVID - 19 and had better prognosis than adults . [ 25 – 27 ] In addition , students aged 6 to 11years were less likely to transmit the virus compared to high - school - aged children , who could transmit the virus as ef ﬁ ciently as adults . [ 28 ] Although it is possible for children to develop multisystem in ﬂ ammatory syndrome after a SARS - CoV - 2 infection , it was very rare and its prognosis was good upon early diagnosis and treatment . [ 21 , 29 ] As of August 31st , 2020 , school - aged children and adolescents accounted for under 7 % of COVID - 19 cases and less than 0 . 1 % of COVID - 19 - related deaths in the United States . Their morbidity and mortality rates were much lower than those of adults . [ 5 , 30 ] Therefore , it is of great importance to re - evaluate the impact of school closures . A safe reopening of schools should be of top priority for policymakers . [ 31 ] Following the guideline of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - analyzes , a comprehensive literature search from PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , Scopus , and Web of Science regarding school closures and its impact on K - 12 students was conducted . The primary outcomes of this study included the impact of school closures on the mitigation of pandemic , mental health , physical well - being , child maltreatment , healthcare and social services , education , and other pertinent public health concerns of K - 12 students . In this literature review , no research subjects ’ information or other sensitive information was collected and / or disclosed . All of the references that have been cited by this paper were published in international peer - reviewed journals with proper review from corresponding ethics committees if necessary . Therefore , an ethical review for this study is not necessary . 2 . Impact on the mitigation of pandemic School closures , one of the primary social distancing measures , was implemented to mitigate transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . [ 32 ] Its effectiveness has become a major concern due to its negative effect on children and adolescents . [ 33 ] To date , there have only been sporadic cases providing limited evidence of school - based transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . [ 34 ] While many ﬁ eld investigations and modeling studies have been published , their results have been inconsistent and their conclusions remain controversial . A studyinvolving 10high schoolsand 5 primary schools in New South Wales traced the close contacts of 18 infected students and staff . The results showed that there may have been 2 secondary cases and no evidence of children infecting faculty members . [ 12 ] In contrast , when Israeli schools fully reopened on May 17th , 2020 after a two - month hiatus , there was a major outbreak in a high school that led to 153 students ( 13 . 2 % ) and 25 staff members ( 16 . 6 % ) testing positive for COVID - 19 . One month later , 87 additional con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 cases had occurred among close contacts of the ﬁ rst school ’ s cases . These included siblings attending other schools , participants in extracurricular activities , and parents and relatives of students and staff members . [ 35 ] Researchers have also obtained contradictory results from modeling studies regarding the effectiveness of school closure on the mitigation of COVID - 19 . In the United Kingdom , some results indicated that delaying school reopening by 2 weeks could halve risks to children . [ 36 , 37 ] In the United States , researchers found that between March 9 , 2020 and May 7 , 2020 , school closures were temporally associated with a signi ﬁ cant decline in the incidence and mortality of COVID - 19 . It was estimated that the adjusted relative change per week of incidence and mortality could decrease by 62 % and 58 % respectively . When cumulative incidence of COVID - 19 was low , the earlier schools closed , the larger the relative reduction in incidence and mortality . [ 38 ] Based on this study , school closures in the United States were associated with 128 . 7 fewer cases per 100 000 population over 26days and with 1 . 5 fewer deaths per 100 000 population over 16days . Using an individual - based stochastic model , researchers from the University of California , Berkeley simulated COVID - 19 trans - mission dynamics based on social - contact data of school - aged children from the Bay Area in California . Assuming children younger than 10years old were half as susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection as older children and adults , from March 17th to June 1st , 2020 , school closures could avert 13 , 842 cases infections ( 95 % con ﬁ dence interval : 6290 – 23 , 040 ) , with similar effect as workplace closures and social distancing . The results also suggested that the effect of school closures was driven by middle and high school students and faculty . [ 7 ] Researchers from the United Kingdom estimated the effects of a range and combinations of different social distancing measures . Using data from the general population and schools of the United Kingdom together with data on transmission dynamics reported from the COVID - 19 outbreak in Wuhan , they found that when all schools and 25 % of universities were closed , there was a 50 % increase in non - school social contacts for families with children and a 25 % increase in community contacts during the closures . [ 39 ] As an isolated measure , school closures were predicted to reduce total deaths by 2 % to 4 % during a COVID - 19 outbreak in the United Kingdom , which was not as effective as case isolation . A combination of measures would be the most effective . Since children are not the key drivers of transmission , school closures alone is relatively insuf ﬁ cient in mitigating the COVID - 19 pandemic , compared to seasonal in ﬂ uenza epidemics . [ 39 ] A network - based modeling study to simulate realistic scenarios of social interventions in Michigan , United States was conducted . Tan Medicine ( 2021 ) 100 : 30 Medicine 2 This model allowed researchers to individually manipulate transmission dynamics with school and workplace closures and social distancing efforts . The results demonstrated that delaying school reopening only delayed and could not reduce the magnitude of the second peak in COVID - 19 cases . Meanwhile , decreasing contact between co - workers was identi ﬁ ed as a signi ﬁ cant factor in delaying and reducing the magnitude of the second wave . [ 40 ] Another modeling study on the effectiveness of different social distancing measures obtained similar results . Researchers from the United States evaluated the impact of different measures , including shelter - in - place orders , bans on large - scale social gatherings , school closures , and closures of entertainment venues , gyms , bars , and restaurant dining areas on the growth rate of con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 cases across United States counties between March 1st , 2020 and April 27th , 2020 . Results showed that adoption of social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate of con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 cases signi ﬁ cantly . There would have been ten times greater spread of COVID - 19 by April 27th without shelter - in - place orders ( 10 million cases ) and more than 35 times greater spread without any of the 4 measures ( 35 million cases ) . However , no evidence proved that school closures had a statistically signi ﬁ cant impact on the growth rate in con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 cases , but the 95 % con ﬁ dence intervals meant that reductions of up to 4 to 5 percentage points could not be ruled out . [ 41 ] Whether school closures can speci ﬁ cally mitigate the transmis - sion of COVID - 19 remains controversial as results of modeling studies were highly dependent on some uncertain parameters , such as the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of children and the extent of community transmission . [ 7 ] Nonetheless , it appears that there is greater evidence supporting the meager impact of school closures . Furthermore , the negative societal side - effects of school closures cannot be ignored . School closures have affected the battle against the pandemic negatively through reductions in the healthcare workforce available to care for patients . In January 2020 , there were about 3 . 1 million healthcare workers across 1 . 3 million households in the United States . About 29 % of them needed to provide care for 3 to 12years old children . [ 42 ] Even if they could receive help from non - working family members , 15 % of healthcare workers would still need childcare during school closures . Based on the results of a modeling study , during the COVID - 19 pandemic , a 15 % healthcare workforce reduction would increase cumulative mortality by 17 . 6 % , compared to the baseline mortality rate of 2 % . [ 42 ] Additionally , school closures burden the economy . Costs have been estimated to be as high as 3 % of the gross domestic product for an 8 - week closures in United States studies and have raised the United States unemployment rate from 3 . 5 % in February 2020 to 14 . 7 % in April 2020 . [ 43 ] These are indicators of a global economic crisis that could be as severe as the 2008 recession . [ 44 ] A society cannot not fully reopen without reopening schools ﬁ rst . Thus , it is also very necessary for policymakers to carefully weigh the potential contagion preven - tion from school closures against the potential increase in mortality due to the loss of available healthcare workers . 3 . Impact on mental health The COVID - 19 pandemic has created substantial stress in many families due to the widespread changes in ﬁ nancial situations , health concerns , and uncertainty about the future . These changes have led to reductions in social contacts , consequently increasing feelings of loneliness that are associated with increased risks of anxiety , depression , and suicidal behavior among children . [ 44 ] A cross - sectional study conducted in Brazil showed that social distancing without parents and more persons living together at home had caused about 20 % of Brazilian children to suffer from anxiety , which may affect the development and mental health of children and adolescents . [ 45 , 46 ] Children and adolescents are active during and after the regular school day . Their normal social life can help them learn from classmates and friends , which is very helpful for them to develop personality traits and a sense of identity . [ 47 ] Due to the pandemic , many schools have been closed for more than half a year , leaving children con ﬁ ned to their homes . In the United States , children were more likely to perform physical activity at home during the early COVID - 19 period rather than play on neighborhood streets as they had done before the pandemic . About a third of children used remote / streaming services for activity classes and lessons during the early - COVID - 19 peri - od . [ 48 ] Removed from their usual schedules and unable to engage in their normal social life , children may have experienced irregular sleeping patterns , lack of interaction with friends or classmates , limited outdoor activities , longer screen time , and changes in family members ’ health and emotional states . These risk factors can be as grave as a traumatic experience and trigger a vicious circle of psychological and physical repercussions . [ 49 – 51 ] Sleep is crucial for children and adolescents ’ mental health and well - being . In the pandemic context , one of the signi ﬁ cant bene ﬁ ts of sound sleep is support to the immune system . [ 52 ] Worsened sleep due to stress may also result in increased susceptibility to mood and anxiety problems and lead to greater attentional dif ﬁ culties and oppositionality for some adolescents , resulting in behavior that resembles attention - de ﬁ cit / hyperactivi - ty disorder . [ 53 ] Research showed that during the pandemic , children ’ s attention - de ﬁ cit / hyperactivity disorder symptoms were signi ﬁ cantly worse than during normal times , which may negatively impact a wide range of aspects including learning ability , interpersonal relationships , self - esteem , and emotions . [ 54 ] Under the stress of the pandemic , children of different ages may exhibit different responses as they may not understand the situation well , perceiving it to be confusing and frightening . [ 55 ] Mild responses to stress may have little effect on daily life . Moderate response may affect emotional , physical , and cognitive functions for several hours . [ 56 ] Younger children may be more nervous and scared , pestering their parents about the situation of the pandemic and asking for their permission to play with peers . Adolescents may have worries , develop irritability , and throw tantrums as they may spend a lot of time following news about the pandemic . [ 57 ] A severe stress response due to isolation , quarantine , and even losing a close relative from the pandemic may seriously affect the lives and learning abilities of children , potentially leading to a severe mental health crisis . [ 58 ] The disruption of peer - to - peer relationships has been associated with depression , guilt , and anger in children . Adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of social distancing and isolation as they are required to physically distance from peers while simultaneously experience signi ﬁ cantly longer time with caregivers . [ 59 ] It is reported that post - traumatic stress disorder scores were 4 times higher in children who were quarantined during pandemics events than those whose movements were not restricted . [ 59 ] Parents or guardians are the primary supporters for children with mental stress . [ 60 ] Nevertheless , in the United States , 40 % of Tan Medicine ( 2021 ) 100 : 30 www . md - journal . com 3 families have school - aged children and in more than 90 % of these households , at least 1 parent is employed outside of the home . [ 61 ] Many working parents have struggled to earn a living and maintain their employment during this economic recession , and thus may not have enough time or energy to alleviate their child / children ’ s mental stress . [ 62 ] Those fortunate enough to be able to work from home have to supervise their children ’ s education and daily life simultaneously . This makes it very easy for them to transmit negative emotions , such as frustration and fear , to their children , increasing family con ﬂ ict . [ 63 ] A systematic review of the United Kingdom discovered that among children , family con ﬂ ict is one of the major precipitants of suicidal acts , and childhood abuse and neglect are also associated with attempts of suicide . Out of those seeking treatment for self - harm , there is a high prevalence of domestic violence victimization . [ 44 , 64 , 65 ] There have also been other tangible negative impacts on families . Families with moderate to severe food insecurity increased from 6 % before March 2020 to 8 % after , employer - sponsored insurance coverage for children decreased from 63 % to 60 % , and 24 % of surveyed parents reported loss of regular child - care . [ 66 ] The results of a national survey showed that since March 2020 , 27 % of parents reported worsening mental health and 14 % reported worsening behavioral health for their children . Worsening mental health for parents occurred alongside worsening behavioral health for children in nearly 1 in 10 families , among whom 48 % reported loss of regular child - care , 16 % reported change in insurance status , and 11 % reported worsening food security . [ 66 ] Many schools have also failed to deliver the necessary mental health services to students due to a lack of guidelines . In this situation , children must learn how to cope with mental stress on their own ; the dif ﬁ culty of this task should not be under - estimated . [ 67 ] Whether prolonged school closures will cause long - term and / or irreversible mental health problems requires further investigation . [ 68 ] 4 . Impact on physical well - being Movement behavior , including suf ﬁ cient physical activity , limited sedentary behavior , and adequate sleep , is important to the healthy development of children and adolescents . [ 69 ] They are recommended to participate in at least 1 hour moderate - intensity to vigorous - intensity physical activity , engage in at most 2hours of sedentary recreational screen time , and have 9 to 11hours of high - quality sleep each day . [ 70 ] When schools were open , providing physical education classes , athletic training , and unstructured free time , it has been estimated that 75 % of American students between the ages of 6 and 15 did not meet the national guidelines for physical activity and have excessively high screen time . [ 71 , 72 ] According to results from a study of Singapore , virtual learning may lead to changes in behavior that are conducive for the onset and progression of myopia . Even if school closures are terminated soon , these behavioral changes , such as increased use of digital devices , increased screen time , and reduced time participating in outdoor activities can lead to long - run increases in prevalence of myopia . [ 73 ] While increased screen time is inevitable and confers some bene ﬁ ts , excessive screen time is also associated with risk factors for cardiovascular problems including obesity , high blood pressure , and insulin resistance . [ 74 ] The level of physical activity has been negatively impacted by school closures . [ 70 ] During prolonged school closures , many students have been left without suf ﬁ cient and appropriate spaces for physical activity and have very little structure and guidance . About 90 % of the children were engaged in free play or other unstructured activity while about 50 % of the children simply went for a walk . [ 48 ] Some children have turned to workout videos posted on various social media websites . Aside from their effectiveness , underprivileged students are once again at a disadvantage for they may not have the same access to such online content . [ 75 , 76 ] In - person schooling , extracurricular activities , and socializa - tion with peers have had to take place via electronic - based platforms . The loss of in - person activities and related peer relationships have contributed to reduced physical activity and increased sedentary screen time and sleeping . [ 70 ] A survey conducted in the United States representing 35 states and Washington D . C . , including 211 children with an average age of 8 . 73years , showed that children engaged in about 1 . 5hours of school - related sitting and more than 8hours of leisure - related sedentary activities each day . The decrease in physical activity and increase in sedentary behavior in older children ( ages 9 – 13 ) was greater than that in younger children ( ages 5 – 8 ) since the pandemic . [ 48 ] Similarly , in Canada , after the outbreak of the COVID - 19 , only 4 . 8 % of children and 0 . 6 % of youth met the combined movement behavior guidelines during COVID - 19 restrictions . Children and youth had lower physical activity levels , less outside time , higher sedentary behavior , and more sleep during the outbreak . [ 69 ] This is quite similar to patterns observed during summer vacations . As a result , prolonged school closures may have disastrous and long - term effects on the health of students all across the United States . [ 48 ] Obesity is one of the adverse effects directly or jointly caused by changes of movement behavior , positive energy balance , and other risk factors . In the United States , among 2 to 19 - year - olds , the prevalence of obesity from 2011 to 2014 was 17 . 0 % and extreme obesity was 5 . 8 % . In particular , the prevalence of obesity in school - aged children ( 6 – 11years ) and adolescents ( 12 – 19years ) was much higher than in preschool - aged children , reaching 17 . 5 % and 20 . 5 % , respectively . The same pattern was seen in both sexes . [ 77 , 78 ] Physical inactivity among children is one of the major behavioral risk factors for childhood obesity . [ 79 ] It has been reported that during summer breaks , the rate of obesity among children in the United States could increase by 0 . 85 percentage points per month ( 95 % con ﬁ dence interval : 0 . 58 – 1 . 12 ) . [ 80 ] At this average rate , there should have been a 5 . 1 % increase after 6 months of school closures . However , the results of a microsimulation modeling study have only suggested an increase of 2 . 373 % in childhood obesity prevalence in 1year of school closures due to the COVID - 19 pandemic in the United States . The average body mass index could increase by up to 0 . 198 , and the impact was modestly greater among boys , and non - Hispanic blacks and Hispanics , respectively . [ 81 ] The dis - crepancy between the results of different modeling studies may be attributed to the different algorithms of the different models and the parameters incorporated . In addition , some families have adopted new hobbies or accessed new physical activity resources , which may partially account for the lower projected increase . Yet , they both support the conclusion that school closures during the pandemic possess the potential to increase the prevalence of childhood obesity . [ 69 ] Childhood obesity is associated with chronic diseases including hypertension , type 2 diabetes , heart disease , stroke , and even some types of cancer . [ 82 ] Extended school closures not only increase the risk of childhood obesity and other chronic diseases due to a positive energy balance but Tan Medicine ( 2021 ) 100 : 30 Medicine 4 also deprive children of the physical and mental - health - enriching bene ﬁ ts of physical activities . [ 81 ] A meta - analysis of 22 studies representing 143 , 603 children also reveals the heightened prevalence of depression among obese children . Compared to normal - weight children , obese children were 1 . 32 times more likely to be depressed , and obese girls speci ﬁ cally were found to be 1 . 44 times more likely to be depressed compared to their normal - weight female counterparts . As the risks for girls also persist into adulthood , clinicians should also consider screening obese girls for symptoms of depression . [ 83 ] 5 . Impact on child maltreatment Studies have shown that stress is a risk factor in child maltreatment potential . [ 84 ] Nearly 40 % of children experienced maltreatment by adulthood , [ 85 ] correlating with lower education attainment , lower income , and social problems , such as an increased likelihood to commit crime and attempt suicide in prison . [ 86 , 87 ] Therefore , it is integral that stress is reduced and cases of maltreatment are brought up by children to trusted adults , such as teachers and psychology workers in schools . [ 88 ] The COVID - 19 pandemic has brought about an unprecedent - ed range of stressors for parents and children alike , impacting their health , safety , and economic well - being , whether families have or have not been directly exposed to the virus . [ 89 , 90 ] In an attempt to maintain social distancing , elementary and secondary schools have canceled in - person classes and shifted instruction online for about a year . Partially as a result , many parents and guardians have been laid off or have had to quit their jobs to take care of their children full - time . [ 17 ] Those who retain their jobs may see their work time and pay reduced , ﬁ nd it dif ﬁ cult to simultaneously work and assist with schoolwork , or have physical dif ﬁ culty looking at screens for long periods of time during teleworking . [ 62 ] As a result , ﬁ nancial , mental , and physical stress for parents are expected . Child maltreatment is a very likely outcome of the accumulation of these risk factors . [ 91 , 92 ] This is a highly prevalent issue , as rates of childhood maltreatment are between 29 % and 68 % . [ 87 ] Literature also revealed that child maltreatment occurred from stressors that result from economic hardship , low education , single parenthood , a large number of dependent children , or extended periods of close contact during stressful times . [ 49 , 93 ] All of these risk factors are applicable or exacerbated by the COVID - 19 pandemic . While more cases of child maltreatment during the COVID - 19 pandemic are expected , research results have indicated reduced reports of them . A study of children in Florida , United States between March and April 2020 uncovered that , when adjusted for seasonal ﬂ uctuation and secular trends , the total number of reported allegations of child maltreatment was more than 27 % lower than what had been expected ; this reduction can largely be attributed to the closing of in - person education . Nationally , it is estimated that 215 , 000 cases of maltreatment went unreported during March and April 2020 . [ 1 ] Many children struggle to report cases of maltreatment and receive treatment for mental illnesses with instruction online . Without the involvement of school - based counselors , these concerns may not be investigated and the long - lasting negative impacts will fester . [ 88 , 93 ] 6 . Impact on healthcare and social services Schools are vital to students across the United States , providing numerous important services in a low - cost and supportive environment . They include basic needs like physical protection , heating , cooling , sanitation , and nutritional support in the form of reduced - price or free breakfast and lunch . Schools also ful ﬁ ll students ’ secondary needs , such as medical care , mental health and psychosocial support , and speci ﬁ c education including driver ’ s education , sexual health education , special education , and advanced academic programs . [ 94 ] Daily , 35 million children in American schools and childcare facilities depend on numerous nutritional programs as a vital safety net against food insecurity . [ 95 ] At least 20 million children rely on schools for breakfast and lunch , [ 88 ] which provide roughly half of children ’ s daily caloric intake . [ 96 ] Surveys indicate that 20 % of children under the age of 12 go hungry and about 14 % of households with children suffered from food insecurity . [ 88 ] Among families with children , food insecurity rates may have doubled since school closures associated with the pandemic , owing in no small part to the lack of school meals . [ 96 ] Roughly 2 . 5 % of America ’ s public - school students do not have a permanent residence . [ 20 ] Therefore , an unintended side effect of school closures to mitigate the spread of COVID - 19 has been the deprivation of these potentially life - saving resources for dozens of millions of American children , who need them even more during this period of remote instruction , economic crisis , social isolation , and high burden on health services . [ 95 ] These negative impacts unfortunately affect underprivileged children the most , as they may have to rely exclusively on health services through schools and their parents may struggle to ﬁ nd and / or pay for the services that their children desperately need . [ 21 , 61 ] According to clinicians working at school - based health centers in New York City , since March 2020 , underprivileged patients have faced growing psychological distress and compounded trauma , and school closures have also prevented them from receiving most of their healthcare . [ 97 ] While there have been efforts to provide essential services , such as nutritional support , to underprivileged children , estimates indicate that less than 1 out of 7 children qualify for the Summer Food Service Program , due to numerous dif ﬁ culties in delivering the services . [ 96 ] School - based health center clinicians have been helping New York City ’ s underprivileged , but the communities they service may nevertheless be more prone to developing clinical disorders due to social isolation and related stressors . [ 97 ] Safe and widespread school reopening is integral for parents to return to their workplaces , perform their jobs to their maximum ef ﬁ ciency , and thus provide as much support for their children as possible . Research further indicated that the lack of these crucial resources during these troubling times also affected learning signi ﬁ cantly . [ 20 ] 7 . Impact on education Schools and teachers have placed great emphasis on ensuring the quality and quantity of academic instruction . However , due to some insurmountable dif ﬁ culties , virtual instruction , while expedient , cannot replace face - to - face instruction . On the other hand , there is emerging evidence regarding the adverse impact of school closures on the education and intellectual development of children and adolescents . [ 57 , 98 ] By the end of the 2019 to 2020 school year in June 2020 , millions of American children have missed months of in - class instruction and vital learning opportunities . Worldwide , about 1 . 6 billion , more than 90 % of the world ’ s students have been affected due to school closures . [ 19 ] During those months , underprivileged students may have lacked access to the proper Tan Medicine ( 2021 ) 100 : 30 www . md - journal . com 5 technology necessary to have the best remote learning experience possible . [ 99 ] With summer vacation immediately following the months - long hiatus of in - person learning , many of America ’ s children face serious risk of falling behind the normal academic curve by 9 to 12months . [ 47 , 88 , 100 ] Additionally , the lack of in - person education has prevented children from fully engaging in meaningful and much needed social - emotional experiences , such as playing with classmates , resolving problems and con ﬂ icts , learning to help 1 another , and forming and maintaining relationships with peers and adults . [ 21 ] Online education is challenging for students , especially younger ones . Many are at the stage where they are developing crucial ﬁ ne motor skills and hand - eye - coordination with projects and activities that cannot be properly conducted through a computer screen . The dif ﬁ culties of remote instruction are further compounded by the possible lack of parental guidance due to work or other obligations . This is particularly detrimental to young students , most of whom have not properly disciplined themselves to pay attention and learn without an authority ﬁ gure in their vicinity . [ 47 , 94 ] Nonetheless , a survey indicates that 31 % of parents in the United States would still prefer to keep their children at home for the fall semester , if given the choice . [ 101 ] Hence , the negative impact of school closure on education is signi ﬁ cant . Many schools have considered returning portions of students to classrooms in a gradual process , frequently beginning with younger students and students with special education needs , for the same aforementioned reasons . [ 102 ] Nevertheless , this brings about its own unique educational challenges . It is dif ﬁ cult for teachers to ensure social distancing , proper sanitation , and educational quality in the classroom while simultaneously interacting with students receiving education remotely . [ 94 ] Young children in classrooms will not be able to resist the urge to interact with each other after months of separation , leading to breaches of social distancing rules and the possibility of physical contact that may spread the virus . [ 12 ] As a result , certain schools have laid out independent learning plans . Nevertheless , not only are many students not able to rigidly follow them , but education is best conducted in groups in a social manner . [ 21 ] 8 . Impact on other public health issues Adolescence , referring to the period between the ages of 10 and 19years , is a critical period of growth leading to physical , psychological , and sexual maturation , during which adolescents tend to explore and develop sexual relationships . Positive and healthy relationships are strongly linked to the sexual and reproductive health as well as overall well - being of adoles - cents . [ 103 ] Therefore , sexual and reproductive health of adoles - cents should de ﬁ nitely not be ignored in the midst of COVID - 19 . In particular , prolonged school closures may contribute to unintended teenage pregnancy , which may lead to termination of education , reduced job and career prospects , and increased vulnerability to poverty and exclusion . In addition , complications during pregnancy and delivery of teenage pregnancy are the leading causes of death for 15 to 19years old girls globally . [ 104 ] In some areas , during prolonged school closures , adolescent girls are at a higher risk of dropping out of school and being forced into childhood marriages . They may also experience sexual exploita - tion and / or violence . [ 105 ] Although the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in most states has been decreasing over the past score years , teenage pregnancy is still one of the most important public health issues in the United States . [ 106 – 108 ] It is worth noting , however , that the decreasing trend was not observed across all ethnic groups and socioeconomic classes . For example , from 1991 to 2014 , the birth rate among teens aged 15 to 19years old in the United States declined 61 % , from 61 . 8 to 24 . 2 births per 1000 . However , in 2014 , the teen birth rate remained approximately twice as high for Hispanic and non - Hispanic black teens compared to non - Hispanic white teens . [ 106 – 109 ] During stay - at - home and social - distancing mandates and other COVID - 19 - related events , the pornographic website Pornhub has noted a worldwide increase in pornography use . When Pornhub made its premium services free , more substantial increases were observed in the United States and some European countries . [ 110 ] It is dif ﬁ cult to determine the exact age groups of the users . However , it is reasonable to assume that when adults view such pornographic content , adolescents may have uninten - tionally seen it , or adolescents may have viewed pornography secretly when their parents / guardians were not present to satisfy their curiosity and / or cope with loneness and / or anxiety . [ 111 ] In addition , other internet addictions , including internet gaming disorder , online gambling , problematic substance use , and excessive use of social media and communication sites have led to impairment or distress in school - aged children and adolescents . [ 112 – 115 ] Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States . Its prevalence has steadily risen over the past 2 decades by 30 % . [ 116 ] Between 2005 and 2017 , suicide was the third - leading cause of death for Americans aged between 10 and 24years old . In particular , for adolescents between 15 and 19years old , the annual percentage change of suicide rates increased by 3 . 1 % from 2007 to 2014 , followed by a sharp increase of 10 . 0 % from 2014 to 2017 . [ 117 ] Suicide is an extreme consequence of the psychological burden most likely caused by multiple reasons . Therefore , the reasons for the change in suicide prevalence are very complicated . [ 118 ] Previous studies have suggested that anxiety caused by disease and / or social isolation , mental health problems , alcohol and other substance misuse , unemployment and ﬁ nancial loss , relationship problems and loss , access to lethal means , and even TikTok addiction can lead to suicide . [ 119 – 121 ] Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that suicide could be an extreme consequence driven by the psychological burden caused by the measures to mitigate the pandemic of COVID - 19 . However , it is also logical to presume that school closures may have reduced suicide rates by reducing academic and social pressure , as well as peer con ﬂ ict and bullying in school . [ 122 ] A few studies on suicide rates among children and adolescents during the pandemic and school closures have been pub - lished . [ 123 , 124 ] In Japan , the suicide rate did not change signi ﬁ cantly during the ﬁ rst 3 months ( from March to May 2020 ) of school closures as compared to the same period in 2018 and 2019 . [ 125 ] In another study , following a monthly decline in suicide rates by 14 % , it increased by 16 % during the second wave ( July to October 2020 ) in Japan with a 49 % increase among children and adolescents . The changes in suicide rates for children and adolescents may be attributed to school closures and the reopening of schools . [ 118 ] Current literature discussing the impact of school closures due to COVID - 19 on rates of suicides among K - 12 students in the United States is scant . One investigation carried out in Michigan revealed that in the emergency department , the proportion of patients under 18years old encountered suicide - related behavior less than 18 to 65 - year - olds following the onset of the COVID - 19 pandemic . [ 126 ] School Tan Medicine ( 2021 ) 100 : 30 Medicine 6 closures may have decreased academic pressure and the opportunities for suicide - related behavior or access to means of death when the adolescents and their parents / guardians spend more time together in close contact . [ 126 ] The studies above have demonstrated that school closures were associated with sexual health , suicide , and various internet - mediated problematic behaviors . The adverse impacts of the COVID - 19 pandemic and school closures may remain in the long term even with schools fully reopening in the near future . Before more robust investigations are conducted and more reliable data is published , it may be too early to draw de ﬁ nitive conclusions currently . However , it is never too early to take effective preventative measures against vulnerable populations . 9 . Conclusions School closures , as an effort to curb the spread of COVID - 19 , may have been marginally effective during the early parts of the pandemic . Nonetheless , as time has passed , more problems have surfaced as a result of prolonged school closures that make them a poor tradeoff . The absence of in - person instruction signi ﬁ cantly reduces physical activity , negatively affects students ’ mental health , excludes many from a myriad of health services , potentially leads to a series of signi ﬁ cant health problems , impedes the provision of social and emotional support , increases the exposure to con ﬂ ict at home , and causes signi ﬁ cant retardation in academic progress . With students at home , many parents are forced to stay at home to care for them as well , creating ﬁ nancial troubles and burdening communities economi - cally , socially , and health - wise . According to the evidence , it appears that the role children play in transmitting COVID - 19 has been overestimated , and hence the positive effect of school closures . Not only does reopening schools in a staged fashion not solve the problems at their root , they may also raise additional issues . The longer lockdowns continue , the greater the risks to children ’ s well - being . It is hoped that as vaccines and other non - pharmaceutical preventative measures proliferate the United States and other countries , schools can fully reopen their doors to students earlier , allowing these problems to be fundamentally alleviated .
