Here , we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interac - tions of the common factor PU . 1 with small sets of macrophage - or B cell lineage - determining tran - scription factors establish cell - speciﬁc binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter - distal H3K4me1 - marked genomic regions . PU . 1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling , followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and speciﬁcally expressed genes . These locations serve as beacons for additional factors , exempliﬁed by liver X receptors , which drive both cell - speciﬁc gene expression and signal - dependent responses . Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types , these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage - determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type - speciﬁc responses to diverse signaling inputs . INTRODUCTION The development of complex multicellular organisms involves hierarchically organized progenitor cells that ultimately give rise to terminally differentiated cell types with specialized func - tions . Cell fates are speciﬁed by lineage - determining transcrip - tion factors whose expression is often not limited to a single cell type ( Tronche and Yaniv , 1992 ) . Comparisons of the genome - wide binding patterns of different transcription factors in a variety of species and cell types have generated two major insights regarding transcription factor binding patterns : ( 1 ) different factors in the same cell type tend to colocalize on a genome - wide scale ( Chen et al . , 2008 ; MacArthur et al . , 2009 ) , and ( 2 ) the same factor in different cell types or at different stages of development exhibits different genome - wide binding patterns ( Lupien et al . , 2008 ; Odom et al . , 2004 ; Sandmann et al . , 2006 ) . Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon , including protein - protein interactions that enable ternary complex formation with DNA ( Verger and Duterque - Coquillaud , 2002 ) , pioneeringfactorsthatdisrupttheclosednucle - osome conformation and enable other factors to bind ( Cirillo et al . , 2002 ) , cooperativebindingofoneormorefactorstoclusteredsites thatfacilitatesnucleosomedisplacementandstablebindingofthe factors involved ( Boyes and Felsenfeld , 1996 ; Miller and Widom , 2003 ) , and binding to chromatin marked in a cell type - speciﬁc manner by lysine 4 - methylated histone H3 ( H3K4me1 / 2 ) ( Lupien etal . , 2008 ) , asignofopenchromatinthatiscorrelatedwithactivity ofnearby genes ( Heintzman et al . , 2009 ) . However , how transcrip - tion factors gain access to their eventual binding sites and the hierarchy of events that generate their cell type - speciﬁc binding and the associated epigenetic modiﬁcation patterns have not previously been elucidated on a genome - wide scale . The mammalian hematopoietic system represents a well - characterized model for the analysis of the combinatorial sets of transcription factors that orchestrate the development of distinct cell types from hematopoietic stem cells . Within the hematopoietic system , macrophages and B cells play essential and complementary roles in the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system . Recent studies suggest a model in which these cell types are derived from a lymphoid - primed multipoten - tial progenitor ( LMPP ) that subsequently gives rise to common lymphoid progenitor ( CLP ) and granulocyte - macrophage pro - genitor ( GMP ) cells ( Adolfsson et al . , 2005 ) ( Figure 1A ) . The Ets factor PU . 1 is required for the generation of both GMP and 576 Molecular Cell 38 , 576 – 589 , May 28 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . CLP , and the later stages of macrophage and B cell develop - ment are additionally dependent on a number of cell type - restricted factors . Of these , AP - 1 and C / EBP family factors are required for macrophage development and function ( Friedman , 2007 ) , whereas E2A , EBF1 , Pax5 , and Oct - 2 play important roles in the development and function of B cells ( Medina and Singh , 2005 ) . In addition to their roles in hematopoietic development , recent evidence suggests that PU . 1 - bound sites in macro - phages play a role in shaping the transcriptional response to inﬂammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , likely by generating cell type - speciﬁc regions of open chromatin that serve as beacons for the recruitment of transcriptional coactiva - tors in response to stimuli ( Ghisletti et al . , 2010 ) . To address the question of how lineage - determining transcrip - tion factors bind to genomic regions in a cell - speciﬁc manner , we investigated the genome - wide locations of PU . 1 and the effects of loss or gain of other transcription factors on the PU . 1 binding pattern in macrophages , B cells , and different B cell progenitors . In addition , we assessed the impact of loss and gain of PU . 1 on the cistrome of the myeloid - restricted transcription factor , C / EBP b . Our results suggest that cell type - speciﬁc cistromes arise from collaborative interactions between small sets of lineage - determining factors that result in enhanced DNA binding , nucleosome remodeling , and subse - quent deposition of the epigenetic enhancer mark H3K4me1 .

Distinct PU . 1 Binding Programs in Macrophages and B Cells We initially performed chromatin immunoprecipitation - coupled deep sequencing ( ChIP - Seq ) ( Barski et al . , 2007 ) to deﬁne the PU . 1 cistromes in mouse peritoneal macrophages and splenic B cells . These analyses identiﬁed 45 , 631 and 32 , 575 PU . 1 - bound genomic sites ( FDR < 0 . 1 % ) in macrophages and B cells , respectively ( Table S1 available online ) , which included known PU . 1 target sites ( Figure S1A ) . Of these sites , 17 , 130 were inde - pendently identiﬁed as bound by PU . 1 in both cell types ( Figures 1B , 1C , and S1B ) . PU . 1 was enriched at transcription start sites ( TSS ) relative to their genomic frequency , but the majority of binding occurred at inter - and intragenic sites ( Figure S1C ) . Scatter plots of the tag counts around genomic peak coordi - nates enable comparative visualization of experimentally ob - served peaks and allow the overlay of other annotations present at these genomic coordinates . ( For example , the tag counts associated with PU . 1 peaks at the genomic coordinates a , b , and c in Figure 1B are indicated in Figure 1C ) . Unexpectedly , more than 80 % of the PU . 1 sites localized to promoters ( TSS ± 500 bp , green data points in Figure 1C ) exhibited similar occu - pancy levels in both cell types , whereas differentially bound sites were mostly located in distal regions ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . To examine the relationship of PU . 1 binding sites and gene expression patterns , we performed transcriptome analysis of elicited macrophages and splenic B cells and correlated binding at each PU . 1 site with the mRNA level of the closest gene . Out of 17 , 004 genes analyzed , 58 . 0 % and 54 . 9 % were associated with at least one PU . 1 peak in macrophages and B cells , respectively , with most of these genes exhibiting multiple peaks ( Figure 1E ) . Genes associated with PU . 1 binding were more likely to be expressed ( Figure 1E ) , and the number of peaks per gene was positively associated with gene expression in both cell types ( Figure 1F ) . Cell type - speciﬁc PU . 1 binding was also correlated with cell type - speciﬁc gene expression ( Figures 1G and S1D ) . Though this relationship was signiﬁcant ( Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r 2 = 0 . 30 , p < 10 (cid:2) 100 ) , even cell type - speciﬁc genes often exhibited a mix of cell type - speciﬁc and commonly bound PU . 1 peaks ( e . g . , Figure 1B , peak position [ b ] ) . The association between cell - speciﬁc PU . 1 binding and cell - speciﬁc gene expression was strongest for peaks close to the TSS ( Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r 2 = 0 . 45 , p < 10 (cid:2) 100 ) ; however , even the distantly located set of PU . 1 peaks ( > 100 kb ) showed correlation with vicinal gene expression ( r 2 = 0 . 21 , p < 10 (cid:2) 100 ) . This is in line with the known distinct roles of PU . 1 in both transcription initia - tion and enhancer function ( Fisher and Scott , 1998 ; Lichtinger et al . , 2007 ) . PU . 1 Binds in the Vicinity of Other Lineage - Determining Transcription Factors To gain insight into possible sequence determinants of the distinct PU . 1 binding patterns observed in macrophages and B cells , we examined promoter - proximal and distal regions that were either commonly or cell type - speciﬁcally bound by PU . 1 for enriched sequence elements by de novo motif analysis . The most enriched motifs were nearly identical in each of the different subsets and resembled the known PU . 1 consensus element ( Figures 2A and Figure S2A ) . The only exception was found at proximal promoter peaks common to both cell types , where PU . 1 likely competes for binding with ETS factors , such as GABP a , at related ETS sites found in CpG islands ( Xie et al . , 2005 ) . Though nearly 60 % of all PU . 1 peaks contain either the PU . 1 or GABP version of ETS motifs , the most enriched motif in the remaining peaks was a degenerate ETS core motif ( RRGGAASY ) . Overall , (cid:3) 85 % of all PU . 1 peaks contain an ETS site , strongly suggesting that PU . 1 binds directly to the vast majority of its DNA target sites ( Figure 2A and Table S2 ) . In addition to the ETS motifs , common promoter - proximal PU . 1 - bound regions were highly enriched for motifs that have previously been shown to be generally enriched in promoters ( Xie et al . , 2005 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Both promoter - proximal and promoter - distal commonly PU . 1 - bound regions exhibited enrichment for a PU . 1 : IRF composite , consistent with the ability of PU . 1 and IRF4 / 8 to form a ternary complex on this class of composite sites in both cell types ( Eisenbeis et al . , 1993 ; Pongu - bala et al . , 1992 ) . In addition , promoter - distal regions bound by PU . 1 in both cell types were enriched for a CTCF motif , likely because CTCF - bound sites generally coincide with accessible chromatin , as measured by DNase I hypersensitivity ( Xi et al . , 2007 ) . In striking contrast , macrophage - speciﬁc and B cell - speciﬁc PU . 1 - bound regions were signiﬁcantly co - enriched for motifs for macrophage - and B cell - restricted , lineage - determining transcription factors , respectively ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . This was evident to a similar degree in both promoter - proximal and promoter - distal regions ( Table S2 ) . Analysis of the spatial rela - tionships between these co - enriched motifs and the PU . 1 motif in each peak revealed that C / EBP and AP - 1 motifs were highly enriched within 100 bp of macrophage - restricted distal PU . 1 sites , whereas E2A , EBF , Oct , and NF - k B motifs were corre - spondingly highly enriched near B cell - speciﬁc distal PU . 1 sites ( Figures 2B , 2C , and S2B ) . Conversely , the B cell - speciﬁc motifs were depleted in the vicinity of macrophage - speciﬁc PU . 1 sites , whereas the regions around B cell - restricted PU . 1 sites were depleted of macrophage - speciﬁc motifs ( Figures 2C and S2B ) . Secondary PU . 1 motifs were also enriched within 100 bp of the central PU . 1 motif , particularly at macrophage - speciﬁc and commonly bound sites ( Figure S2B ) . To conﬁrm that the PU . 1 - co - enriched motifs were occupied by the associated cell type - restricted transcription factors , we carried out ChIP - Seq for C / EBP a and C / EBP b in peritoneal macrophages and for Oct - 2 in splenic B cells . For C / EBP a and C / EBP b , which displayed an almost identical genomic binding pattern , we identiﬁed (cid:3) 40 , 000 binding sites ( Table S1 and Figure S2C ) . Of these sites , 13 , 840 ( 34 . 6 % ) were located within 100 bp of a PU . 1 - bound site , 60 % of which were speciﬁc to macrophages , whereas only 1 % were localized to B cell - speciﬁc PU . 1 peaks ( 4 3 PU . 1 tag difference ) ( Figure 2D ) . For Oct - 2 , the number of identiﬁed sites ( 1191 ) was smaller than for the C / EBPs ; however , the results complemented the above ﬁndings Molecular Cell Determinants of Cell Type - Speciﬁc Cistromes 578 Molecular Cell 38 , 576 – 589 , May 28 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 0 2 4 6 8 10 M Φ P U . 1 C h I P - S e q T a g C oun t ( l og 2 ) B cell PU . 1 ChIP - Seq Tag Count ( log2 ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 Common Motifs A C D E C / EBP α / β - Enriched Motifs C / EBP 28 . 5 % ( 2 . 5 % ) 50 . 5 % ( 2 . 9 % ) 11 . 5 % ( 1 . 2 % ) 9 . 9 % ( 1 . 2 % ) 39 . 3 % ( 8 . 8 % ) 30 . 2 % ( 9 . 1 % ) 33 . 5 % ( 14 . 3 % ) AP - 1 : C / EBP PU . 1 Oct - 2 - Enriched Motifs OCT PU . 1 PU . 1 Peaks Co - bound C / EBP β A ll PU . 1 PU . 1 Core Distal P r o x i m a l CTCF GABP SP1 NRF1 GFY NFY CRE B c e ll M a c r ophage E2A PU . 1 : IRF EBF NF - κ B OCT AP - 1 C / EBP AP - 1 : C / EBP AP - 1 PU . 1 : IRF B 0 0 . 0005 0 . 0010 0 . 0015 0 . 0020 0 . 0025 0 . 0030 - 300 - 200 - 100 0 100 200 300 MacrophageCommonB cell 0 0 . 0005 0 . 0010 0 . 0015 0 . 0020 0 . 0025 - 300 - 200 - 100 0 100 200 300 0 0 . 0001 0 . 0002 0 . 0003 0 . 0004 0 . 0005 0 . 0006 0 . 0007 0 . 0008 - 300 - 200 - 100 0 100 200 300 0 0 . 0005 0 . 0010 0 . 0015 0 . 0020 0 . 0025 0 . 0030 0 . 0035 - 300 - 200 - 100 0 100 200 300 MacrophageCommonB cell MacrophageCommonB cell MacrophageCommonB cell M o t i f s p e r bp Distance from PU . 1 Motif Distance from PU . 1 Motif Distance from PU . 1 Motif Distance from PU . 1 Motif 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % - 6 - 4 - 2 0 2 4 6 F r ac t i on o f P eaks C on t a i n i ng M o t i f s ( - 100 , + 100 bp ) Ratio PU . 1 Binding ( log2 ) ( Macrophages vs .

C / EBP and Oct - 2 binding sites exhibited similar relationships with gene expression as were observed for PU . 1 ( Figure S2E ) . C / EBP - and Oct - 2 - bound regions were highly enriched for C / EBP and octamer motifs , respectively ( Figure 2E ) . In addition , C / EBP - bound regions were co - enriched for a recently described C / EBP : AP - 1 composite element ( Cai et al . , 2008 ) as well as canonical PU . 1 and AP - 1 motifs , whereas Oct - 2 - bound regions in B cells were highly enriched for a PU . 1 as well as a PU . 1 - IRF composite motif ( Figure 2E ) . Combinatorial Interplay Delineates Stage - Speciﬁc Cistromes The observation that PU . 1 binding occurred in the vicinity of motifs bound by lineage - restricted transcription factors promp - ted us to ask whether PU . 1 binding to these sites was dependent on the presence of the respective factors . We addressed this question in B lineage progenitors devoid of both E2A and EBF ( E2A (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) , EBF only ( EBF (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) , or control cells that express both factors ( Rag1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) , which are arrested at successive stages in B cell development ( Dias et al . , 2008 ; Ikawa et al . , 2004 ; Lin and Grosschedl , 1995 ; Mombaerts et al . , 1992 ) ( Figure 1A ) . ChIP - Seq for PU . 1 in each of these cell populations yielded 44 , 609 , 36 , 908 and 17 , 210 peaks in E2A (cid:2) / (cid:2) , EBF (cid:2) / (cid:2) and Rag1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) progenitors , respectively ( FDR < 0 . 1 % , Table S1 ) . Surprisingly , despite the apparent loss in total number of PU . 1 peaks comparing one developmental stage to the next , each succes - sive stage was characterized by the appearance of PU . 1 sites at new genomic positions that were not occupied by PU . 1 in the previous progenitor stage . Using the PU . 1 sites identiﬁed in E2A (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells as control , de novo motif analysis of the 3760 , 2479 , and 9504 PU . 1 sites exhibiting 3 3 more tags in the EBF (cid:2) / (cid:2) , Rag1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) , and mature B cells , respectively , revealed enrichment for distinct motifs for transcription factors expressed at respective stages of B cell development ( Figure 3A and Table S3 ) , demonstrating that PU . 1 binding is dependent on the activity of other lineage - determining transcription factors . For example , co - enriched E2A motifs were gained comparing the PU . 1 cistrome in EBF (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells to that in E2A (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells ( Figure 3A ) . Furthermore , gained sites were primarily associated with genomic regions corresponding to B cell - speciﬁc PU . 1 binding sites in mature splenic B cells , as exempliﬁed by the reshaping of the PU . 1 binding site pattern comparing CLP / pre - pro B ( EBF (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) to pro - B cells ( Rag1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) ( red data points in Figure 3B ) . To directly test whether the binding of PU . 1 to B lineage - speciﬁc sites is dependent on E2A , we retrovirally transduced E2A - deﬁcient CLP / pre - pro B cells derived from the bone marrow of E2A (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ( Ikawa et al . , 2004 ) either with a tamox - ifen - inducible E2A estrogen receptor ligand - binding domain fusion protein ( E47 - ER ) or with the analogous construct coding for a deletion mutant of E47 that retains the bHLH DNA - binding and dimerization domain but lacks both activation domains ( bHLH - ER ) ( Sayegh et al . , 2003 ) . Upon activation of the full - length E47 - ER fusion protein with tamoxifen for 6 hr , PU . 1 binding increased at 3752 sites > 4 3 relative to the bHLH - ER control , as exempliﬁed by the Ig k 3 0 enhancer ( Figure 3C ) , and these sites were strongly co - enriched for an E2A motif ( Fig - ures 3D and S3A ) . In contrast , the PU . 1 cistrome in these cells ( 44 , 609 peaks total ) was not signiﬁcantly altered by expression of the E2A deletion mutant lacking transcriptional activation domains ( Figure 3C ) . To conversely investigate whether PU . 1 itself can also pro - mote binding of one of its cistrome - associated factors , we assessed the genome - wide effects of inducing PU . 1 activity on C / EBP b binding in a PU . 1 - deﬁcient ( PU . 1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) myeloid progenitor cell line ( Walsh et al . , 2002 ) . In the absence of PU . 1 , C / EBP b exhibited a reduced overall binding pattern ( 22 , 641 peaks ) , with loss of numerous binding sites associated with locations of PU . 1 binding in primary macrophages , illustrated for the macrophage - speciﬁc Cd14 gene ( PU . 1KO - Cebpb versus Mac - Cebpb , Figure 3E ) . Motif analysis of the C / EBP b - bound regions in PU . 1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells recovered C / EBP , C / EBP : AP - 1 , AP - 1 , and RUNX motifs , as well as a non - PU . 1 Ets motif ( AACAGGAAGT ) , but not the PU . 1 binding motif found in primary macrophages ( Figure S3G ) . We next evaluated the consequences of PU . 1 activity on C / EBP b binding in PU . 1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells stably expressing a tamox - ifen - responsive PU . 1 estrogen receptor ligand - binding domain fusion protein ( PUER ) ( Walsh et al . , 2002 ) . In this inducible system , low levels of PU . 1 activity and DNA binding are observed by ChIP - Seq in the absence of tamoxifen ( 8144 peaks total , exempliﬁed in Figure 3E , PUER - PU . 1 - 0h ) . This low - level PU . 1 activity was associated with partial recovery of C / EBP b binding in the vicinity of some PU . 1 binding sites ( Figures 3E and S3H , PUER - C / EBP b - 0h ) . Tamoxifen treatment induced PU . 1 binding to a total of 37 , 909 genomic regions after 1 hr and resulted in a gain of 1710 C / EBP b binding sites ( > 4 3 tags relative to the 0 hr time point ) , restoring a large number of macrophage - speciﬁc PU . 1 binding sites . The induced C / EBP b binding regions were strongly enriched for a PU . 1 motif ( Figures 3F and S3B ) and were cobound by PU . 1 at more than 75 % of sites . Intriguingly , 57 % of PU . 1 binding sites observed in the absence of tamoxifen were cobound by C / EBP b , implying that C / EBP and related factors play an important role in directing PU . 1 localization when effective PU . 1 concentrations are low . PU . 1 Induces Sequential Nucleosome Remodeling and Histone H3K4 Monomethylation Recent studies have demonstrated that lineage - determining transcription factors preferentially associate with genomic regions marked by cell type - speciﬁc patterns of histone modiﬁ - cations , such as monomethylation of H3K4 ( H3K4me1 ) , that are suggested to signify accessible chromatin and / or enhancer - like elements ( Heintzman et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , trimethylation of H3K4 ( H3K4me3 ) marks active and / or poised promoters ( Kim et al . , 2005 ) . We therefore proﬁled H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in both macrophages and B cells using ChIP - Seq and found that the majority ( > 80 % ) of PU . 1 - bound sites were associated with either promoter - proximal H3K4me3 or distal H3K4me1 in both cell types . Cell - speciﬁc binding of PU . 1 at distal sites was highly associated with cell - speciﬁc H3K4me1 ( Figure 4A ) . Analysis of the genomic distribution of the H3K4me1 signal averaged for all distal PU . 1 binding sites revealed a bimodal pattern with a pronounced reduction of signal centered over the PU . 1 binding Molecular Cell Determinants of Cell Type - Speciﬁc Cistromes 580 Molecular Cell 38 , 576 – 589 , May 28 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . site ( Figure 4B ) , analogous to that recently described for H3K4me1 around promoter - distal FoxA2 - and STAT1 - bound sites in mouse liver and HeLa cells , respectively ( Robertson et al . , 2008 ) . Similarly , 80 % of distal Oct - 2 and C / EBP sites were marked by a corresponding pattern of cell - speciﬁc H3K4me1 ( Figure 4B ) .

Using the PUER - inducible system , we performed ChIP - Seq for H3K4me1 in PUER cells at 0 , 1 , and 24 hr of tamoxifen treatment . Very little change in H3K4me1 signal was observed after 1 hr ( 38 peaks gained ) , but a marked increase occurred at 3328 locations by 24 hr ( > 4 3 tags , 15 % of total H3K4me1 peaks present at 0 hr ) . To evaluate the relationship between PU . 1 binding and H3K4me1 , we selected a subset of 7428 highly induced PU . 1 binding sites ( > 8 - fold increase in tag count at 1 hr ) , which exhibited less than two tags at 0 hr . These binding sites could be classiﬁed into three groups , with representative peaks from each group shown in Figure 4C . The largest group ( group I , 43 % ) consists of sites that gained signiﬁcant H3K4me1 24 hr after PU . 1 activation . This gained H3K4me1 signal exhibited a bimodal spatial distribution identical to that observed for PU . 1 - associated H3K4me1 in macrophages and B cells ( Figure S4A ) . Together with the fact that 90 % of the sites that gain H3K4me1 are within a 1 kb window of a gained PU . 1 site , these ﬁndings suggest that PU . 1 binding is required to direct the local deposi - tion of H3K4me1 at these sites . Group II ( 32 % ) consists of induced PU . 1 binding sites that were marked by pre - existing H3K4me1 . In this group , PU . 1 binding initiated remodeling of the local H3K4me1 - containing nucleosomes at 1 hr and 24 hr , again establishing a pattern identical to that in macrophages and B cells ( Figure S4A ) . Group III ( 25 % ) consists of peaks that , despite stable binding of PU . 1 , were not enriched for H3K4me1 at any time point , indicating that , here , PU . 1 binding is not sufﬁcient to establish this mark . Increased recruitment of C / EBP b to groups I ( 37 % ) and II ( 30 % ) relative to group III ( 11 % ) peaks ( < 100 bp ) suggests that additional factors may be required for deposition of H3K4me1 . Group I and II peaks , but not group III peaks , were enriched for the 464 vicinal genes that were upregulated greater than 4 - fold in PUER cells following 24 hr tamoxifen treatment ( Weigelt et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure S4B ) . To investigate whether the remodeling of H3K4me1 - marked nucleosomes in the group II peaks was consistent with changes in nucleosomal occupancy , we mapped nucleosome positions using MNase - Seq ( Schones et al . , 2008 ) in PUER cells at 0 hr and 1 hr after treatment with tamoxifen . Analysis of the nucleo - some pattern before tamoxifen treatment at the 7428 regions where PU . 1 is maximally gained at 1 hr revealed a semi - regular pattern exposing the prospective PU . 1 binding site on an expanded linker region between adjacent nucleosomes ( Fig - ure 4D ) . This pre - existing pattern is possibly due to low levels of PU . 1 binding that are below detection by ChIP - Seq at the current sequencing depth , as it is possible to detect PU . 1 at many of these sites in untreated PUER cells using qPCR - based ChIP assays ( data not shown ) . Induction of PU . 1 binding led to nucleosome remodeling across the entire set of induced sites , analogous to that suggested by the group II H3K4me1 - marked nucleosomes , resulting in further expansion of the linker region centered on the PU . 1 binding site and compression of nucleo - somes in either direction along the DNA for (cid:3) 1 kb . In concert , these ﬁndings suggest a sequence of events at group I sites in which PU . 1 binding induces nucleosome remodeling , which is followed by monomethylation of H3K4 . Simple Combinations of Binding Sites Identify Cell Type - Speciﬁc RepertoiresofH3K4me1 - MarkedRegions The striking association of PU . 1 and collaborating lineage - deter - mining transcription factors with cell - speciﬁc H3K4me1 in mac - rophages and B cells led us to perform a de novo motif analysis of the (cid:3) 20 , 000 distal genomic regions that were focally marked by H3K4me1 in each cell type . This analysis revealed that these regions in macrophages were most highly enriched for PU . 1 , AP - 1 , C / EBP , and RUNX motifs ( Figure 4E ) , whereas H3K4me1 - marked regions in B cells displayed maximal enrich - ment for PU . 1 , E2A , OCT , EBF , and RUNX motifs ( Figure S4C ) . This computational result is supported by ChIP - Seq data demonstrating that the majority ( 70 % ) of the H3K4me1 - positive regions in macrophages were bound by PU . 1 and / or C / EBP b ( Figure 4F ) and is consistent with the ﬁnding that PU . 1 ( and likely C / EBP ) binding can induce H3K4me1 deposition . Of note , anal - ysis of the genome - wide location of p300 in resting macro - phages ( Ghisletti et al . , 2010 ) indicates marked enrichment at genomic locations cobound by PU . 1 and C / EBP b ( Figure 4G ) . To determine whether there is an analogous relationship between promoter - distal H3K4me1 and binding sites for tran - scription factors in other cell types , we performed de novo motif analysis on H3K4me1 / H3K4me3 ChIP - Seq data sets from mouse embryonic stem cells ( Meissner et al . , 2008 ; Mikkelsen et al . , 2007 ) , liver ( Wederell et al . , 2008 ) , human CD4 + T cells ( Barski et al . , 2007 ) , and CD36 + erythrocyte precursors ( Cui et al . , 2009 ) . Similar to the results in macrophages and B cells , H3K4me1 - marked promoter - distal regions in these tissues were highly enriched for motifs for transcription factors required for the generation and maintenance of each cellular phenotype ( Ivanova et al . , 2006 ; Rothenberg and Taghon , 2005 ; Zaret et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure S4C ) . For example , H3K4me1 - marked promoter - distal regions in ES cells were signiﬁcantly enriched for motifs recognized by KLF4 , OCT4 , SOX2 , and Esrr b , factors that , in combination , are sufﬁcient to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells ( Feng et al . , 2009 ) . In CD4 + T cells , this analysis revealed a strong association of H3K4me1 - marked regions with Ets and Runx motifs , consistent with their known essential roles in T cell development and function ( Fig - ure S4C ) ( Rothenberg and Taghon , 2005 ) . In this cell type , genome - wide data for nucleosome positions , DNase hypersen - sitivity , and mononucleosomal ChIP - Seq for a wide range of histone modiﬁcations are available , allowing precise determina - tion of nucleosome positions , chromatin accessibility , and histone modiﬁcations ( Barski et al . , 2007 ; Boyle et al . , 2008 ; Schones et al . , 2008 ) .

Molecular Cell Determinants of Cell Type - Speciﬁc Cistromes 584 Molecular Cell 38 , 576 – 589 , May 28 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . revealed nucleosome phasing around the Ets motif similar to the pattern that we observed around PU . 1 in PUER cells , which was accompanied by a sharp spike in DNase I hypersensitivity at the Ets site ( Figure S4F ) . This result is in stark contrast to the continuous nucleosome distribution observed when aligning the data on the means of the tag distributions ( Figure S4F ) and establishes that the central gap in the H3K4me1 pattern over the transcription factor motif is reﬂective of the absolute nucleo - some positions and represents the predominant DNase I - acces - sible location at these promoter - distal sites . PU . 1 Establishes Cell Type - Speciﬁc Cistromes for Signal - Responsive Transcription Factors Given the large number of transcription factors that are known to play important roles in each cell type ( e . g . , more than 350 tran - scription factors are transcribed in macrophages and ES cells ; see Figure S4D ) , it was surprising to ﬁnd that only small numbers of transcription factor motifs were highly overrepresented in the H3K4me1 patterns in the different cell types that we analyzed ( FiguresS4C andS4E ) . Toexploretherelationshipoftranscription factors whose motifs are not enriched in H3K4me1 - marked regions with H3K4me1 - associated factors , the global H3K4me1 pattern , and cell type - speciﬁc gene expression , we initially focused on Liver X Receptors ( LXR a and LXR b ) . These oxy - sterol - responsive nuclear receptors play numerous roles central tomacrophagefunctionbyregulatingtargetgenesinvolvedinlipid metabolism , cell survival , and immunity ( Rigamonti et al . , 2008 ) . ChIP - Seq of in vivo biotin - tagged LXR b in the murine macro - phage RAW264 . 7 cell line ( validated in Figures S5A and S5B ) identiﬁed 664 conﬁdent LXR b binding sites ( FDR < 0 . 1 % ) , 85 % of which were distally located relative to the TSS of vicinal genes ( Figure 5A ) . Conventional , antibody - based ChIP assays for endogenous LXR b in primary macrophages conﬁrmed 12 of 12 representative LXR b binding sites ( Figure S5C ) . While de novo motif analysis identiﬁed the consensus LXR response element ( DR4 ) as the most highly enriched motif , PU . 1 and AP - 1 motifs were also highly co - enriched in LXR b - bound regions ( Figure 5B ) . In line with motif enrichment , 34 % of LXR b peaks were within 100 bp of a PU . 1 - bound site in primary macrophages ( Figure 5C ) , exempliﬁed for the established LXR target gene Abcg1 ( Fig - ure 5D ) . In addition , macrophage LXR b binding sites exhibited a macrophage - speciﬁc H3K4me1 signature , in contrast to the H3K4me1 pattern around the same sites in liver ( Robertson et al . , 2008 ) , another tissue in which LXRs play key regulatory roles ( Figures 5E and 5G ) . To determine the inﬂuence of LXRs and PU . 1 on each other’s DNA binding proﬁles , LXR binding in the absence or presence of PU . 1 was compared in PU . 1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) and tamoxifen - treated PUER cells , and conversely , PU . 1 binding was assessed in wild - type and in LXR a / b double - knockout bone marrow - derived macro - phages . Quantitative ChIP analysis for LXR b in PU . 1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) versus tamoxifen - treated PUER cells demonstrated that LXR b recruit - ment to sites with vicinal PU . 1 binding ( within 100 bp ) was PU . 1 dependent ( Figure 5F ) . This was not the case for LXR b - binding sites that were not in close proximity to PU . 1 ( Figure 5F ) , indicating that PU . 1 determines LXR binding in a spatially restricted manner . In concert with these ﬁndings , macrophage - speciﬁc LXR b - bound regions displayed a signiﬁcant PU . 1 - dependent gain in H3K4me1 signal comparing H3K4me1 ChIP - Seq proﬁles in PU . 1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) versus tamoxifen - treated PUER cells ( Figure 5E ) . Conversely , the PU . 1 cistrome and H3K4me1 patterns around macrophage - speciﬁc LXR b - bound sites were not signiﬁcantly altered in LXR a / b double - knockout macro - phages ( Figures 5G and 5H ) , suggesting that LXRs do not contribute to deﬁning the PU . 1 cistrome or to establishing the H3K4me1 pattern at these regions . PU . 1 Is Required for LXR and TLR - Dependent Gene Expression Although PU . 1 binding sites are signiﬁcantly correlated with expression of vicinal genes ( Figures 1E and 1F ) , an unbiased analysis of 71 sites in resting macrophages and B cells using a transient reporter gene assay revealed that a relatively small fraction ( 15 % ) conferred constitutive enhancer activity ( Fig - ure S6A ) . Given the ﬁnding that PU . 1 participates in establishing the macrophage - speciﬁc LXR cistrome , it is possible that many of these sites might participate in deﬁning the context - and signal - dependent transcriptional repertoire in each cell type . In support of this concept , regions containing both LXR b and PU . 1 binding sites exhibit signiﬁcant sequence conservation in vertebrates , consistent with their potential importance as functional signal - responsive regulatory modules ( Figure S5D ) . Functional analysis of representative LXR - PU . 1 - cobound genomic regions vicinal to LXR target genes ( as deﬁned by their responsiveness to the synthetic LXR ligand GW3965 in primary macrophages , Figure S6B ) by transient reporter gene analysis in RAW264 . 7 cells demonstrated that 10 of 11 genomic regions that were tested exhibited ligand - dependent enhancer activity ( Figure 6A ) . Furthermore , induction of LXR target genes in response to the LXR agonist GW3965 in PUER cells was mark - edly PU . 1 dependent ( Figure 6B ) . To test whether such PU . 1 dependence is a feature of other transcriptional programs deﬁning macrophage - speciﬁc outputs , we assessed PU . 1 dependence for TLR4 signaling responses in PUER cells . TLR4 ligation induces high - magnitude changes in the expression of hundreds of genes in macrophages involved in innate immune responses through the activation of numerous signal - dependent transcription factors , including NF - k B and interferon regulatory factors ( Lee and Kim , 2007 ) . Transcriptome analysis of primary macrophages treated for 6 hr with the speciﬁc TLR4 agonist Kdo2 lipid A ( KLA ) identiﬁed 735 genes induced more than 3 - fold . PU . 1 and C / EBP b binding in resting macrophages occurred in the vicinity of 641 and 583 of these genes , respectively , and prior to KLA stimulation , these two factors colocalized , alone or together , with 537 of the 654 H3K4me1 - marked regions associated with these genes ( Fig - ure 6C ) . Quantitative transcript analysis of 20 of these genes in the PUER system indicated that 14 required induction of PU . 1 ( H ) Scatter plot depicting PU . 1 ChIP - Seq tag counts ( log2 ) within 200 bp of combined genomic PU . 1 peak positions deﬁned in bone marrow - derived macrophages from wild - type mice ( WT M F ) or LXR a (cid:2) / (cid:2) / LXR b (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ( LXR DKO M F ) .

Full responses of the remainder of these genes in untreated PUER cells indicated that the TLR4 - signaling pathway is functional prior to activation of PU . 1 . DISCUSSION Here , we provide evidence that collaborative interactions between PU . 1 and small sets of other lineage - determining tran - scription factors at closely spaced binding sites establish a large proportion of their respective macrophage and B cell - speciﬁc cistromes . The spatial distributions and frequencies of the motifs for each of these factors suggest that these patterns arise from direct binding of each factor to its cognate DNA motif rather than tethering of one factor to the other . Conversely , the lack of a ﬁxed distance between the motifs , their enrichment within 100 bp of each other , and the nucleosome remodeling observed around sites where inducible PU . 1 binds in PUER cells , often in conjunction with C / EBP b , is consistent with a mechanism in which concurrent binding of these factors enables effective competition with nucleosomes ( Miller and Widom , 2003 ) to deﬁne cell type - speciﬁc binding patterns .

Molecular Cell Determinants of Cell Type - Speciﬁc Cistromes 586 Molecular Cell 38 , 576 – 589 , May 28 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . The ﬁnding that PU . 1 binding leads to deposition of the H3K4me1 mark at promoter - distal sites that are correlated with cell type - speciﬁc patterns of gene expression ( Heintzman et al . , 2009 ) provides the initial evidence that PU . 1 contributes to the ‘‘writing’’ of this epigenetic signature on a genome - wide scale . Our data also indicate that PU . 1 binding and nucleosome remodeling are not sufﬁcient to result in the deposition of this mark in all cases ( Figure 4C , group III ) , suggesting that the mech - anisms that ultimately lead to H3K4 monomethylation also require collaborative interactions with other transcription factors , such as C / EBP b . In addition , the motifs enriched in focally H3K4me1 - marked promoter - distal regions in macrophages and B cells and the shape of the H3K4me1 patterns around the binding sites of three of these factors ( C / EBP a / b , Oct - 2 ) suggest that the other H3K4me1 - associated factors are also involved in nucleosome displacement and targeting of H3K4me1 deposition around their binding sites . The observation that H3K4me1 - marked regions in other tissues and cell types , including liver , erythrocytes , T cells , and ES cells , also exhibit enrichment for limited sets of motifs for corresponding lineage determining factors ( Figure S4C ) suggests a general approach to the identiﬁcation of such factors in distinct cell types , knowl - edge of which may facilitate cellular reprogramming efforts . Taken together , our ﬁndings support a model in which two tiers of transcription factors cooperate to activate cis - active regulatory elements required for the development and function of macrophages and B cells ( Figure 6E ) . The ﬁrst tier consists of relatively small sets of lineage - determining factors , such as PU . 1 , C / EBPs , and E2A , that act in a collaborative manner to delineate large sets of potential cis - regulatory elements in a cell type - speciﬁc fashion ( exempliﬁed for macrophages in Figure 6E ) . The speciﬁc attributes of these factors that enable this role remain to be deﬁned but presumably include expression levels and the ability to engage nucleosome - remodeling factors and ultimately histone - modifying enzymes that generate an accessible ‘‘proto - enhancer’’ structure . Consistent with this , wild - type E2A induces PU . 1 binding at B cell - speciﬁc genomic sites that contain closely spaced PU . 1 and E2A motifs , whereas a mutant form of E2A that is competent to bind to DNA but lacks transcriptional activation function does not ( Figure 3C ) . This result highlights an important role for transactivation domains in enabling combinatorial transcription factor binding to chroma - tinized DNA at enhancer - like elements , in addition to their known roles in transcription initiation . We provide further evidence that the priming of cis - active elements by lineage - determining factors is required for the subsequent binding of a second tier of factors , exempliﬁed by LXRs ( Figure 6E ) and transcription factors that are activated by TLR4 signaling . This interpretation is supported by the recent observation that recruitment of p300 to new genomic locations in macrophages in response to TLR4 activation primarily occurs at regions exhibiting pre - existing H3K4me1 ( Ghisletti et al . , 2010 ) , which , from our analysis , largely are sites of combinatorial interactions of PU . 1 , C / EBP , and AP - 1 transcription factors . Collectively , these sequential events lead to a functionally active enhancer capable of contributing to cell type - speciﬁc and / or signal - dependent gene expression , similar to the sequential steps leading to activation of the Csf1r locus during macrophage development ( Krysinska et al . , 2007 ) . This model offers an explanation for the extensive genome - wide and cell type - speciﬁc colocalization of transcription factors observed in various previous studies ( Chen et al . , 2008 ; MacArthur et al . , 2009 ) and provides insights into how simple combinations of lineage - restricted transcription factors on a genome - wide scale can specify promoter - distal cis - regulatory elements ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type - speciﬁc responses to diverse signaling inputs . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Isolation and Culture Primary cells were isolated from male 6 - to 8 - week - old C57Bl / 6 mice ( Charles River Laboratories ) .
