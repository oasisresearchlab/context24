BISHOP 1 and Alan HALL MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology , University College London , Gower Street , London WC1E 6BT , U . K . Rho GTPases are molecular switches that regulate many essential cellular processes , including actin dynamics , gene transcrip - tion , cell - cycle progression and cell adhesion . About 30 potential eﬀector proteins have been identiﬁed that interact with members of the Rho family , but it is still unclear which of these are responsible for the diverse biological eﬀects of Rho GTPases . This review will discuss how Rho GTPases physically interact with , and regulate the activity of , multiple eﬀector proteins and how speciﬁc eﬀector proteins contribute to cellular responses . To date most progress has been made in the cytoskeleton ﬁeld , and THE RHO FAMILY Rho GTPases are members of the Ras superfamily of monomeric 20 – 30 kDa GTP - binding proteins . Ten diﬀerent mammalian Rho GTPases , some with multiple isoforms , have been identiﬁed to date : Rho ( A , B , C isoforms ) , Rac ( 1 , 2 , 3 isoforms ) , Cdc42 ( Cdc42Hs , G25K isoforms ) , Rnd1 } Rho6 , Rnd2 } Rho7 , Rnd3 } RhoE , RhoD , RhoG , TC10 and TTF [ 1 ] . The most extensively characterized members are Rho , Rac and Cdc42 . Each of these GTPases act as a molecular switch , cycling between an active GTP - bound , and an inactive GDP - bound , state . In the GTP - bound form they are able to interact with eﬀector or target molecules to initiate a downstream response , while an intrinsic GTPase activity returns the proteins to the GDP - bound state , to complete the cycle and terminate signal transduction . Regulation Cycling between the GTP - and GDP - bound states is regulated by numerous cellular proteins [ 2 ] . Although still poorly charac - terized , over 30 guanosine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) have been identiﬁed that facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP [ 3 , 4 ] . All Rho GEFs contain a Dbl - homology ( DH ) domain which encodes the catalytic activity [ 5 , 6 ] and an adjacent pleck - strin homology ( PH ) domain . The PH domain is thought to mediate membrane localization through lipid binding [ 7 , 8 ] , but , in addition , structural and biochemical evidence suggests that it might also directly aﬀect the activity of the DH domain . For example , a comparison of the crystal structures of the DH - PH domains of Sos GEF , in the absence of lipid ligand , and the PH domain of phospholipase C d bound to inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - Abbreviations used : ACK , activated Cdc42 - associated tyrosine kinase ; GEF , guanosine nucleotide exchange factor ; PH , pleckstrin homology ; DH , Dbl homology ; PIP 2 , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ; GAP , GTPase - activating protein ; GDI , guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor ; SRF , serum response factor ; NF - j B , nuclear factor j B ; JNK , c - jun N - terminal kinase ; CRIB , Cdc42 / Rac - interactive binding ; REM , Rho eﬀector homology ; RKH , ROK – kinectin homology ; MLC , myosin light chain ; PI - 4 - P5K , phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ; GTP [ S ] , guanosine 5 « - [ c - thio ] triphosphate ; MAP kinase , mitogen - activated protein kinase ; Mlk , mixed - lineage kinase ; ACC , antiparallel coiled - coil ; Btk , Bruton’s tyrosine kinase ; MBS , myosin - binding subunit ; ERM , ezrin / radixin / moesin ; FH , formin - homology ; WASP , Wiskott – Aldrich - syndrome protein ; WAVE , WASP - like verprolin - homologous protein ; LIMK , LIM kinase ; EGF , epidermal growth factor ; TNF a , tumour necrosis factor a ; MEKK , MAP kinase kinase kinase ; PAK , p21 - activated kinase ; PKN , protein kinase N ; MRCK , myotonic dystrophy kinase - related Cdc42 - binding kinase . 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed ( e - mail anne . bishop ! ucl . ac . uk ) . several biochemical links have now been established between GTPases and the assembly of ﬁlamentous actin . The main focus of this review will be Rho , Rac and Cdc42 , the three best characterized mammalian Rho GTPases , though the genetic analysis of Rho GTPases in lower eukaryotes is making increasingly important contributions to this ﬁeld . Key words : actin reorganization , autoinhibition , CRIB motif , HR1 motif . trisphosphate , suggests that a ligand binding to Sos PH domain is likely to aﬀect the conformation of the neighbouring DH domain [ 9 ] . In Trio , a GEF with two DH - PH modules , one speciﬁc for Rac and one for Rho [ 10 ] , the N - terminal DH - PH domains together have a 100 - fold higher Rac GEF activity than does the DH domain alone [ 11 ] . Finally , the binding of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP # ) to the PH domain of Vav GEF inhibits activity , whereas phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate binds more strongly and stimulates Vav activity [ 12 ] . Additional domains speciﬁc to each GEF may provide variations in subcellular localization and activation mechanisms [ 13 ] . About 20 GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) which increase the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of Rho GTPases have been identiﬁed to date [ 14 ] . The human genome sequencing project reveals that chromosome 22 alone potentially encodes eight GAPs [ 15 ] . A comparison of the crystal structures of a ground - state complex between RhoGAP and Cdc42 [ guanosine 5 « - [ b , c - imido ] triphosphate ( guanosine 5 « - [ b , c - imido ] triphosphate , also known as ‘GMPPNP’ , is a non - hydrolysable GTP analogue ) and a transition - state - mimicking complex of Rho - GAP with RhoA [ GDP [ AIF % − , along with NMR analysis of a Cdc42 [ RhoGAP complex , has provided insight into the mech - anistic details of GAP - facilitated GTP hydrolysis [ 16 – 18 ] . The most striking feature is that a 20 (cid:176) rotation between GTPase and GAP , from ground state to transition state , allows an arginine residue in the GAP protein , the ‘arginine ﬁnger’ , to enter the GTPase active site and participate in the stabilization of the transition state . Rho GTPases are able to interact with membranes via a post - translational C - terminal geranylgeranyl lipid modiﬁcation # 2000 Biochemical Society 242 A . L . Bishop and A . Hall Table 1 Summary of the cellular activities which involve Rho , Rac and Cdc42 These activities refer to biological pathways which can be induced by the activated Rho GTPases indicated and / or which can be inhibited by dominant - negative constructs of the appropriate Rho GTPases . SRF and NF - j B are both transcription factors ; JNK and p38 are MAP kinase pathways ; the NADPH oxidase complex is present only in professional phagocytic cells ; secretion has only been shown to involve Rho GTPases in mast cells .

However , in the unactivated state , Rho and Rac can be isolatedasasolublecomplexassociatedwithRhoGDI ( guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor ) . RhoGDI appears to sequester GDP - bound Rho GTPases in the cytoplasm and inhibit their spontaneous GDP % GTP exchange activity , similar to what has been proposed for bc subunits and the a subunits of hetero - trimeric G - proteins , but the precise role of GDI is still poorly understood [ 21 ] . NMR and crystal structures of GDI alone , a low - resolution crystal structure of a RhoA [ GDI complex ( no geranylgeranyl lipid attached to RhoA ) and a recent high - resolution [ 0 . 26 nm ( 2 . 6 A / ) ] crystal structure of a Cdc42 [ GDI complex ( geranylgeranyl lipid present on Cdc42 ) all agree that the binding of GDI to a Rho GTPase occurs through an immunoglobulin - like C - terminal domain , and that a hydro - phobic pocket in this domain can accommodate the geranyl - geranyl lipid , whilst a ﬂexible N - terminal domain inhibits GDP % GTP exchange [ 22 – 25 ] . Cerione’s group reported the use of ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( ‘FRET’ ) to monitor the removal of Cdc42 from membranes by GDI in real time . They detected two phases which appear to represent a rapid membrane - associated GTPase – GDI binding step followed by a slow transfer of the geranylgeranyl moiety from membrane to GDI [ 26 ] . Experimental manipulation The biological activities of individual Rho GTPases ( Table 1 ) have been elucidated using a variety of methods , including the use of activated and dominant - negative mutants , as well as bacterial toxins . Amino acid substitutions of Val for Gly at codon 12 or of Leu for Gln at codon 61 ( Rac numbering ) have been extensively used to generate constitutively active Rho GTPases , since both of these mutations prevent intrinsic and GAP - induced GTP hydrolysis . The crystal structure of RhoGAP complexed with RhoA [ GDP [ AIF % − conﬁrms an essential role for Gln ’ $ ( equivalent to Gln ’ " in Rac ) in stablizing the c - phosphate during GTP hydrolysis [ 17 ] . The crystal structure of a [ Val " % ] RhoA [ guanosine 5 « - [ c - thio ] triphosphate ( GTP [ S ] ) ( equi - valent to the Val " # mutant in Rac ) ( GTP [ S ] is a non - hydrolysable GTP analogue ) shows how the larger Val side chain forces Gln ’ $ away from the c - phosphate , so preventing it from facilitating GTP hydrolysis [ 27 ] . Interestingly Rnd1 - 3 and TTF Rho family members do not contain Gly and Gln at positions 12 and 61 respectively and thus appear to be constitutively GTP - bound [ 28 – 30 ] . This raises interesting questions as to how these proteins are regulated , but so far nothing is known . A substitution of Asn for Thr " ( ( Rac numbering ) allows this mutant GTPase to compete with the corresponding endogenous GTPase for binding to cellular GEFs , but this leads to a non - productive complex unable to generate a downstream response [ 31 ] . These dominant - negative proteins appear to be rather speciﬁc for individual Rho GTPases , despite the complexity of the RhoGEF family [ 3 ] . A variety of bacterial toxins have been used to modify the activity of Rho GTPases . The exoenzyme C3 transferase , an ADP - ribosyltransferase from Clostridium botulinum [ 32 ] , is rela - tively speciﬁc and inactivates only RhoA , RhoB and RhoC . C . diﬃcile toxin B inactivates most , if not all , members of the Rho GTPase family and is particularly useful in assessing the in - volvement of a Rho GTPase in a particular biological process [ 33 ] . The prevelance of Rho GTPase modiﬁcations by bacterial toxins illustrates the fundamental importance of these proteins to cellular regulation . Biological activities The major function of Rho GTPases is to regulate the assembly and organization of the actin cytoskeleton [ 34 ] . The eﬀects of Rho , Rac and Cdc42 were initially described using quiescent Swiss3T3 ﬁbroblasts , a cell line in which serum starvation creates a very low background of organized F - actin structures . Addition of lysophosphatidic acid induces the formation of contractile actin – myosin stress ﬁbres and associated focal adhesions , and this can be blocked by C3 transferase [ 35 ] . Growth factors , such as platelet - derived growth factor , insulin or epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) induce the formation of actin - rich lamellipodia and membrane ruﬄes associated with focal contacts and the dominant - negative [ Asn " ( ] Rac speciﬁcally inhibits this response [ 36 ] . Finally bradykinin induces the formation of peripheral microspikes or ﬁlopodia , which are also associated with focal contacts , and this can be inhibited by expression of dominant - negative [ Asn " ( ] Cdc42 [ 37 ] . These types of experiment have lead to the conclusion that Rho , Rac and Cdc42 regulate three signal - transduction pathways linking various membrane receptors to the assembly of actin – myosin ﬁlaments , lamellipodia and ﬁlo - podia respectively . It is not surprising , therefore , that Rho GTPases have been found to play a role in a variety of cellular processes that are dependent on the actin cytoskeleton , such as cytokinesis [ 38 – 40 ] , phagocytosis [ 41 , 42 ] , pinocytosis [ 36 ] , cell migration [ 43 , 44 ] , morphogenesis [ 45 ] and axon guidance [ 46 ] . One of the most interesting aspects of this family of regulatory proteins is that , in addition to their eﬀect on the actin cyto - skeleton , they also regulate a variety of other biochemical pathways ( see Table 1 ) including serum response factor ( SRF ) and nuclear factor j B ( NF - j B ) transcription factors [ 47 , 48 ] , the c - jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) and p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase pathways [ 49 , 50 ] , the phagocytic NADPH oxidase com - plex [ 51 ] , G " cell - cycle progression [ 52 ] , the assembly of cadherin - containing cell – cell contacts [ 53 , 54 ] , secretion in mast cells [ 55 ] , # 2000 Biochemical Society 243 Rho GTPases and their eﬀector proteins cell polarity [ 56 ] and cell transformation [ 3 ] . Therefore , although Rho GTPases are best characterized for their eﬀects on the actin cytoskeleton , there is now much interest in their ability to aﬀect cell proliferation and gene transcription , and the contributions of all of these activities to malignant transformation is an important ﬁeld of study . THE INTERACTION OF Rho GTPases WITH EFFECTOR PROTEINS Given the involvement of Rho GTPases in such a wide variety of important cellular processes , it is not surprising that a great deal of eﬀort has been put into identifying their cellular targets or eﬀector proteins . To date 30 or so potential eﬀectors for Rho , Rac and Cdc42 have been identiﬁed ( Table 2 ) , primarily using aﬃnity chromatography and the yeast two - hybrid system . These proteins interact speciﬁcally with the GTP - bound form of the GTPase . A comparison of the RhoA [ GDP and [ Val " % ] RhoA [ GTP [ S ] crystal structures , reveals that the confor - mational diﬀerences between the GTP and GDP - bound forms are restricted primarily to two surface loops , named switch regions I and II ( Cdc42 } Rac amino acids 26 – 45 and 59 – 74 respectively ) [ 27 , 57 ] . Eﬀector proteins must , therefore , utilize these diﬀerences to discriminate between the GTP - and GDP - bound forms , though they also interact with other regions of the GTPase ( see below ) . Table 2 Potential effector proteins for Rho , Rac and Cdc42 Proteins shown with an asterisk ( * ) are those which appear to be activated by GTPases in a GTP - dependent manner , but where the interaction is GTP - independent . Proteins shown with a superscript plus sign ( + ) are those for which a functional relationship with GTPase , but not a direct interaction , has so far been shown . Note that Rho is reported to inhibit diacylglycerol kinase ( DAG kinase ) , whereas all the other targets listed are thought to be activated by Rho GTPases . Common GTPase - binding motifs , assigned according to sequence homology are : CRIB , REM ( also known as class - 1 Rho - binding motif ) and RKH ( also known as class - 2 Rho - binding motif ) . Where a function has been reported this is noted , but in many cells these are far from clear ; for further discussion , see the text and key references given below .

For example , the interaction of PAK ( p21 - activated kinase ) with Cdc42 } Rac is blocked by a Tyr % ! - to - Cys mutation , but not by a Phe $ ( - to - Ala mutation [ 58 ] . Whereas the interaction of Mlk ( mixed - lineage kinase ) 2 and 3 with Rac is blocked by either of these mutations [ 61 ] . Substitution of diﬀerent amino acids at the same position in switch I can also have varied eﬀects upon target protein binding ; for instance , [ Cys % ! ] Rac can bind to p67 phox ( a component of the NADPH oxidase complex ) , whereas [ Lys % ! ] Rac cannot [ 58 ] . Such results suggest that diﬀerent eﬀectors interact with diﬀerent residues , even within the switch I region . Further studies using GTPase mutants and chimaeras have implicated regions outside of switch I in the binding of certain eﬀectors . For instance , Rac – Rho chimaeras indicate that a region close to the C - terminus of Rac ( amino acids 143 – 175 ) may be important for binding to p67 phox and for PAK activation [ 62 ] . An a - helical region present in all Rho - family GTPases ( except Drosophila RhoL ) , but not in Ras , referred to as the ‘insert region’ ( Rac amino acids 123 – 135 ) , is required for Rac activation of the NADPH oxidase complex and for binding to an eﬀector protein called IQGAP , but not for its interaction with PAK [ 63 , 64 ] .

Conserved CRIB consensus residues are shown in red ; * indicates less conserved residues within the CRIB motif . ( b ) Conserved HR1 motif consensus residues are shown in red ; * indicates important HR1 motif residues that are less conserved . Charged amino acids which are particularly important for PKN binding to Rho , according to structural data , and are less conserved in the other two PKN HR1 motifs ( HR1b and HR1c ) are underlined ( see the text for discussion ) . requiring this insert region for binding . Two amino acids in loop 6 ( just C - terminal to switch II ) of Rho are acidic ( Asp ) ( and Asp * ! ) , but are hydrophobic ( Val and Ala ) in Rac , and these appear to be important for Rho binding to two eﬀectors PRK2 and ROK [ 65 ] . This same region of Rac ( amino acids 74 – 90 ) , on the other hand , has been implicated in the binding of GAPs [ 62 ] and an overlapping region of Cdc42 ( amino acids 84 – 120 ) appears to be involved in binding to Wiskott – Aldrich - syndrome protein ( WASP ) and IQGAP , but not to PAK1 [ 66 ] . These mutational studies indicate that distinct regions of Rac , Cdc42 and Rho outside of switch I are required to make essential contacts with eﬀector proteins . The data obtained from the many mutational studies that have been undertaken have lead to a complex , and sometimes con - tradictory , picture of the mechanisms of Rho GTPase – eﬀector interactions . However , the recently reported NMR structures of Cdc42 bound to a ctivated C dc42 - associated tyrosine k inase ( ACK ) ( amino acids 504 – 545 ) and WASP ( amino acids 230 – 288 ) have provided much clariﬁcation [ 67 , 68 ] . ACK and WASP both contain the conserved GTPase - binding consensus site , the CRIB ( C dc42 } R ac - i nteractive b inding ) motif , which is present in many , though not all , Rac - and Cdc42 - binding proteins ( see Table 2 ) [ 69 ] . The CRIB sequences for ACK and WASP , and a consensus sequence , are shown in Figure 1 ( a ) . This motif is necessary , but not suﬃcient , for strong binding to the GTPase , as shown by binding studies for Cdc42 with diﬀerent WASP fragments [ 70 ] . The NMR structures of ACK and WASP CRIB - containing peptides bound to Cdc42 show that Asp $ ) in Switch I interacts with the two His residues conserved in all CRIB proteins ( Figure 1a ) . Interestingly Switch I and II are almost identical in Rho , Rac and Cdc42 , except for position 38 which is Asp in Rac } Cdc42 and Glu in Rho . Mutation of Cdc42 Asp $ ) to Glu decreases the aﬃnity for PAK3 ( a CRIB protein which binds to both Rac and Cdc42 ) by 50 - fold [ 71 ] , and it seems likely that all CRIB proteins may use Asp $ ) to distinguish Rac } Cdc42 from Rho . Whereas PAK1 binds with similar aﬃnity to Rac and Cdc42 [ 72 ] , ACK and WASP are relatively selective for Cdc42 [ 73 , 74 ] . To achieve this selective binding , ACK and WASP must interact with amino acids that diﬀer between Cdc42 and Rac , and these contacts have been revealed in the NMR studies [ 67 , 68 ] . [ Leu " ( % ] Cdc42 , for instance , forms a strong hydrophobic contact with both ACK and WASP , but in Rac residue 174 is Arg , which would weaken this interaction . The ACK CRIB residue which interacts with Leu " ( % is Leu & ! & , but the equivalent residue in PAK is Lys , which would not pack well against Leu " ( % and is , presumably , therefore , not involved in the # 2000 Biochemical Society 245 Rho GTPases and their eﬀector proteins interaction ( see Figure 1a ) . The equivalent residue in WASP is Ile , which should pack almost as well as Leu ( see Figure 1a ) . Thus , a picture of how diﬀerent eﬀector proteins recognize diﬀerent combinations of Rho GTPases emerges . However , while ACK and WASP are clearly Cdc42 targets , it is not clear whether , in (cid:138) i (cid:138) o and under physiological conditions , PAKs 1 – 3 are targets for Cdc42 or Rac or both . A further insight gained from these NMR structures is that the GTPase induces signiﬁcant conformational changes in ACK and WASP . The CRIB - containing fragments of ACK and WASP used in these experiments ( amino acids 504 – 545 and 230 – 288 respectively ) have no discernable structure in solution , but when bound to Cdc42 they form a tight intermolecular b - sheet across the GTPase switch regions . Presumably Cdc42 stabilizes this key conformation , which is only one of many that the free peptide can adopt in solution . WASP sequences C - terminal to the core CRIB motif form an anti - parallel b - hairpin and a short a - helix only when bound to Cdc42 . Equally , the switch regions of free Cdc42 in solution are ﬂexible , but become rigid when bound to an eﬀector . These NMR data have certainly provided much insight into how CRIB motif - containing proteins , in general , may interact with Rac and Cdc42 . However , one must remember that not all Rac } Cdc42 eﬀector proteins contain a CRIB domain ( see Table 2 ) , so cannot be assumed to bind to GTPases in the same way . IQGAP , for instance , appears to require the insert region for binding to Rac and Cdc42 ( see above ) which has not been shown to be required for the binding of any of the known CRIB - containing proteins . Such observations imply that a very diﬀerent set of interactions may be formed between Rac and Cdc42 and their numerous eﬀectors . Rho binding to its eﬀector proteins also appears , from mutational studies , to require quite diﬀerent GTPase regions compared with Rac and Cdc42 ( see above ) . Rho eﬀectors protein kinase N ( PKN ) } PRK1 and PRK2 bind to Rho via an N - terminal Rho eﬀector homology ( REM ) region which contains three repeats of a leucine - zipper - like motif named HR1 ( amino acids 40 – 91 , 129 – 184 and 216 – 271 ) . The ﬁrst two HR1 repeats ( HR1a and HR1b ) can each independently bind to Rho , but only HR1a binding is GTP - dependent ( Figure 1b shows PKN HR1a sequence and the HR1 motif consensus sequence ) [ 75 ] . The scaﬀold - like Rho eﬀectors rhophilin and rhotekin also contain one N - terminal HR1 motif , very similar to PKN HR1a , which is required for their GTPase binding ( see Figure 1b ) [ 76 , 77 ] . Recently the crystal structure of PKN amino acids 7 – 155 ( HR1a and half of HR1b ) bound to RhoA [ GTP [ S ] has been solved [ 78 ] . When bound to Rho the HR1a region of PKN forms an antiparallel coiled - coil ( ACC ) ﬁnger fold , a very diﬀerent con - formation to the CRIB peptides of ACK and WASP bound to Cdc42 . Rho residues within switch I , particularly Lys # ( and Gln # * , make strong contacts with PKN , and allow the eﬀector to speciﬁcally recognize the GTP - bound form of Rho ; Lys # ( in particular is inaccesible in the GDP – Rho structure . These are switch I residues diﬀerent from those which appear to be important for Cdc42 recognition by ACK and WASP ( see above ) [ 67 , 68 ] . A hydrophobic patch at the end of the PKN HR1a ACC ﬁnger , plus hydrogen - bond contacts from PKN Lys & " , Lys & $ , Arg ’ " and Asp ) & ( see Figure 1b ) , form important contacts with Rho switch I , the C - terminal end of switch II ( amino acids 66 – 76 ) and some adjacent amino acids . The polar residues are less conserved in PKN HR1b and HR1c , and the hydrophobic patch is partially replaced by charged residues in HR1c , which may explain why HR1b has low aﬃnity for Rho and why HR1c does not bind to Rho at all , despite their similar overall sequences . Sequence analysis suggests that similar ACC ﬁnger folds will be present in other REM proteins , such as rhopilin and rhotekin , and also perhaps in non - REM Rho eﬀectors such as ROK and kinectin [ 78 ] . THE ACTIVATION OF EFFECTORS BY Rho GTPases The structural analysis of Rho GTPase – eﬀector interactions has so far made use of discrete binding domains derived from eﬀectors . When considering how a GTPase might regulate the activity of a target protein , and how these proteins subsequently transduce signals to the cell , the whole eﬀector protein must be considered . The most common mechanism of eﬀector activation by Rho GTPases appears to be the disruption of intramolecular auto - inhibitory interactions , to expose functional domains within the eﬀector protein ( see the general model in Figure 2 ) . For example the Rac } Cdc42 targets PAK1 – 3 and Ser } Thr kinases , have an intramolecular regulatory domain that inhibits kinase activity . Upon GTPase binding , the inhibitory sequence is displaced , leaving the kinase domain free to bind to substrates [ 79 , 80 ] . Interestingly , a more distantly related PAK family member recently cloned , PAK4 , does not contain an autoinhibitory domain , and this PAK is not signiﬁcantly stimulated by GTPase binding [ 81 ] . In agreement with the model a peptide from the PAK1 regulatory region ( amino acids 83 – 149 ) can be used as a dominant - negative inhibitor of PAK activity both in (cid:138) itro and in (cid:138) i (cid:138) o [ 82 ] , and mutants of the PAK inhibitory domain are found to have constitutive kinase activity [ 82 , 83 ] . Equally , cleavage of PAK - 2 ( and of PKN , see below ) by caspases , which occurs during apoptosis , also removes its regulatory domain and creates a constitutively active protein [ 84 , 85 ] . Two kinases which are Rho eﬀectors have also been reported to contain autoinhibitory domains , ROK and PKN . A region of the ROK a autoinhibitory domain ( amino acids 941 – 1388 ) includes the GTPase - binding and PH domains , and when mutated so as to disrupt binding to Rho , will inhibit endogenous ROK [ 86 ] . In the case of PKN the binding of Rho – GTP appears to co - operate with binding of lipids such as arachidonic acid and with autophosphorylation to remove an autoinhibitory inter - action and to fully activate its protein kinase C - like kinase domain [ 87 – 90 ] . A similar principal may also apply to activation of the many scaﬀold - like targets of GTPases ( see Figure 2 ) . Dia is thought to act as a scaﬀold protein that can be activated by Rho and then interacts with proﬁlin } actin . Recent work has revealed that the N - terminal 389 amino acids interacts with a region at the C - terminus ( amino acids 1116 – 1255 ) , which makes full - length Dia inactive . Binding of Rho to the N - terminal sequence releaves this inhibition and , in agreement with the model , Dia becomes constitutively active when the N - terminal inhibitory region is removed [ 91 ] . Interestingly a human genetic disease , non - syndromic deafness , results from amino acid substitutions in the C - terminal 52 amino acids of human Dia1 , and the experimental work suggests that this might create constitutively active protein [ 92 ] . WASP and N - WASP , two related Cdc42 targets , also appear to be regulated by an intramolecular interaction . The regions of WASP which bind to each other have recently been identiﬁed , using a tryptophan - ﬂuorescence - quenching assay , as the N - terminal GTPase - binding domain ( amino acids 230 – 310 ) and a coﬁlin - homology region at the C - terminus ( amino acids 461 – 492 ) [ 93 ] . Cdc42 – GTP competes with WASP C - terminus for binding to the N - terminus and , according to NMR data , induces a conformational change in the WASP N - terminus quite diﬀerent from its conformation when autoinhibited [ 93 ] . Owing to auto - inhibitory interactions , full - length N - WASP has decreased ac - # 2000 Biochemical Society 246 A . L . Bishop and A .

( 2 ) The eﬀector remains active until GTP hydrolysis takes place . ( 3 ) Alternatively a modiﬁcation of the eﬀector ( Y , orange ellipses ) ( e . g . autophosphorylation , as is the case for PAK [ 72 ] , phosphorylation by a separate kinase or binding to a diﬀerent activating protein ) may maintain activity even after dissociation of the GTPase . ( 4 ) Inactivation of the eﬀector occurs though removal of modiﬁcation Y ( e . g . dephosphorylation or removal of a bound activating protein ) , allowing the eﬀector to re - enter its inactive conformation . tivitycomparedwith thefunctionally importantC - terminalacidic region alone , and Cdc42 - GTP can activate N - WASP by releasing intramolecular interactions [ 94 – 97 ] . A variation on this mode of eﬀector activation has been suggested for the Cdc42 - binding protein IQGAP . In this case a seperate protein , calmodulin - Ca # + , binds to IQGAP ( via its IQ motif ) and inhibits its binding to actin and Cdc42 [ 98 , 99 ] . This might provide a calcium - sensitive regulatory mechanism for controlling the activation of IQGAP [ 56 ] . Almost all Rho GTPase eﬀectors have multiple domains , and some of these might regulate their activity . For example , the PH domains present in WASP and N - WASP are thought to promote association with membrane , through lipid binding , where they may encounter activated Rho GTPases [ 100 ] . The Rho eﬀectors ROK and citron } citron kinase and the Cdc42 eﬀectors MRCK a } b also contain PH domains [ 101 – 104 ] ( MRCKs are myotonic dystrophy kinase - related cdc42 - binding kinases ) . Protein – protein , as well as protein – lipid , interactions can regulate the subcellular localization of GTPase eﬀectors . For example , PRK2 ( though not the related PKN } PRK1 ) , WASP and PAK all contain Pro - Xaa - Xaa - Pro ( Xaa is any amino acid ) classic proline - rich SH3 - binding motifs which have been reported to bind to the adaptor Nck [ 105 – 108 ] . Since Nck also has an SH2 domain , it could recruit these eﬀectors to activated receptor tyrosine kinases . PAK also interacts with another SH3 - con - taining protein , a PIX ( also known as Cool - 2 ) , though this interaction is via a non - classical SH3 domain - binding region of PAK ( amino acids 175 – 206 ) [ 109 , 110 ] . a PIX , which is a Cdc42 } Rac GEF , can potentially activate PAK , and can also localize the kinase to speciﬁc sites within the cell ( [ 79 , 110 , 111 ] , but see [ 111a ] ) ; for example , paxillin recruits Cat } Git } Pkl to focal contacts which , in turn , binds to PIX [ 112 ] , while free G bc subunits released by activated G - protein - coupled receptors bind to G protein - coupled receptor kinases , which can also recruit Cat } Git } Pkl and therefore PIX [ 113 ] . Interestingly , another member of the PIX family , p50Cool - 1 , inhibits PAK , while p85Cool - 1 } b PIX appears neither to inhibit nor activate PAK [ 114 ] . Exactly how the PIX – PAK interaction contributes to Rac } Cdc42 activity requires further investigation . It is noteworthy that many of the Rho GTPase eﬀector proteins contain coiled - coil regions ( ROK , citron , IQGAP , Dia ) which in some proteins have been shown to facilitate oligo - merization , and indeed there is evidence that this is the case for IQGAP [ 115 – 117 ] . Eﬀector oligomerization could add yet another level of complexity to target activation by Rho GTPases . Once PAK has been activated by its interaction with Rac } Cdc42 , it then autophosphorylates , which both decreases its aﬃnity for GTPase ( freeing the GTPase to bind to more eﬀectors # 2000 Biochemical Society 247 Rho GTPases and their eﬀector proteins or to be inactivated by GAPs ) and also maintains PAK in an open , activated conformation even when dissociated from the GTPase [ 72 ] . Similar mechanisms may exist for scaﬀold proteins , though in this case a separate kinase activity would obviously be needed to phosphorylate the eﬀector ( see Figure 2 ) . WASP may be an example of this ; it is a substrate for two tyrosine kinases found in lymphocytes , Lyn and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) [ 118 , 119 ] . WASP shows increased Tyr phosphorylation in the presence of constitutively active Cdc42 , indicating that Cdc42 may recruit WASP to the site of Lyn and Btk activity [ 118 ] . The tyrosine residue phosphorylated by Btk ( Tyr # * " ) [ 119 ] is predicted to disrupt the autoinhibited fold of WASP N - terminus , so may stabilize WASP in an active conformation even in the absence of Cdc42 [ 93 ] . The presence , or not , of kinases which phosphorylate scaﬀold - like eﬀectors , and the activity of phos - phatases ( such as protein phosphatase 2A which co - precipi - tates with PAK1 [ 120 ] ) which dephosphorylate eﬀectors which are held in an active conformation , may prove to be a general mechanism for regulating the kinetics of eﬀector activity ( see Figure 2 ) . Also , in keeping with the model , binding of other proteins to an activated eﬀector , in addition to or instead of phosphorylation , could stabilize eﬀectors in an active confor - mation after GTPase dissociation ( see Figure 2 ) , although no clear example of an eﬀector utilizing such a mechanism has yet been identiﬁed . EFFECTORS WHICH MEDIATE Rho GTPase FUNCTIONS Along with an understanding of how Rho GTPases interact with , and are activated by , eﬀector proteins , there has been much interest in identifying the contributions of speciﬁc eﬀectors to diﬀerent GTPase functions . So far signiﬁcant progress has only been made in identifying eﬀectors involved in actin re - organization . Rho - induced actin reorganization At least two eﬀectors , ROK and Dia , appear to be required for Rho - induced assembly of stress ﬁbres and focal adhesions ( Figure 3 ) . p164ROK a ( also known as Rho - associated kinase ) and p160ROK b ( also known as Rho - associated coiled - coil - contain - ing protein kinase or ROCK ) are Ser } Thr kinases , whose kinase domains resemble that of myotonic dystropy kinase ( 52 % identity ) . They also contain a coiled - coil region , a ROK – kinectin homology ( RKH ) Rho - binding domain , a PH domain and a Cys - rich region . ROKs are activated by binding to Rho – GTP [ 121 , 122 ] . Expression of the constitutively active catalytic domain of ROK a induces stellate actin - myosin ﬁlaments in HeLa and Swiss3T3 cells [ 101 , 123 ] . Inhibition of ROK , on the other hand , using a pharmacological inhibitor ( Y - 27632 ) causes loss of serum and [ Val " % ] Rho - induced stress ﬁbres [ 124 ] . These results indicate that ROK is necessary , but not suﬃcient , for Rho - induced stress - ﬁbre assembly . Two substrates of ROK which are likely to be key players in actin – myosin ﬁlament assembly are myosin light chain ( MLC ) [ 125 ] and the myosin - binding subunit ( MBS ) of MLC phos - phatase [ 126 ] . MLC phosphatase is inhibited by phosphorylation , indirectly leading to an increase in MLC phosphorylation ( see Figure 3 ) . Phosphorylation of MLC occurs at Ser " * , which stimulates the actin - activated ATPase activity of myosin II and promotes the assembly of actomyosin ﬁlaments [ 125 – 127 ] . Interestingly Rho - GTP also binds directly to the MBS of MLC phosphatase , but why Rho should bind to both kinase and substrate is unclear at present [ 128 ] . Rho ROK Dia GTP LIMK – P MLC – P MLC MLC phosphatase MLC kinase Cofilin – P Profilin G - actin Increased actin polymerization Actin - filament stabilization Stress - fibre formation Actomyosin assembly and contraction Figure 3 Signal - transduction pathways involved in Rho - induced stress - ﬁbre assembly ( see the text for details ) Another ROK target is LIM kinase ( LIMK ) , which when phosphorylated is able to inhibit ( by phosphorylation ) coﬁlin , leading to stabilization of ﬁlamentous actin structures ( Figure 3 ) [ 129 , 130 ] . ROK has also been reported to activate a ubiquitous Na + } H + exchange protein ( NHE1 ) and this contributes , via an unknownmechanism , tostress ﬁbreand focal adhesionformation [ 131 – 134 ] . Other substrates for ROK which could contribute to actin assembly are adducin , which is phosphorylated by ROK both in (cid:138) itro and in (cid:138) i (cid:138) o , causing it to bind more strongly to F - actin [ 135 , 136 ] , and the ERM ( ezrin } radixin } moesin ) family of proteins , which link actin to the membrane [ 137 , 138 ] . However , recent data has questioned whether ROK is in fact an in (cid:138) i (cid:138) o ERM - activating kinase [ 139 ] . While the catalytic domain of ROK alone does not induce correctly organized stress ﬁbres , it has been reported that , when combined with an activated ( N - terminal truncation ) version of Dia , stress ﬁbres are induced [ 91 , 140 , 141 ] . This has lead to the idea that activation of both Dia and ROK by Rho are required in order to induce stress ﬁbres . Dia ( Dia1 and 2 in mammals ) is a member of the formin - homology ( FH ) family of proteins and contains two FH domains [ 142 ] . The FH1 sequence contains multiple proline - rich motifs which bind to the G - actin - binding protein , proﬁlin . This interaction somehow allows Dia to con - tribute to actin polymerization and F - actin organization into stress ﬁbres [ 91 , 142 ] . Many observations point to a role for lipids , particularly PIP # , in actin cytoskeleton rearrangements . For instance , the binding of PIP # to capping proteins such as gelsolin can induce their release from actin - ﬁlament barbed ends , providing a mech - anism whereby PIP # could increase actin polymerization [ 143 ] . There are some data to suggest that PIP # is involved in Rho eﬀects . Injection of antibodies against PIP # , for example , has been reported to inhibit serum - induced assembly of stress ﬁbres [ 144 ] . Furthermore , overexpression of phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PI - 4 - P5K ) ( to producePIP # ) induces massive # 2000 Biochemical Society 248 A . L . Bishop and A . Hall actin polymerization in COS - 7 cells [ 145 ] . It is noteworthy that mutation of the gene for a yeast PI - 4 - P5K , mss4 , results in defects in the formation of actin cables , which can be repressed by overexpression of Rho2p , a Rho - like GTPase [ 146 ] . A physical association between Rho and a type I ( PI - activated ) PI - 4 - P5K activity has been detected in Swiss - 3T3 - cell lysates , though this interaction is not GTP - dependent and may not be direct [ 147 ] . PIP # also binds to vinculin , increasing its talin - binding ability ; therefore PIP # synthesis could also help to induce focal adhesion formation [ 144 ] . PI - 4 - P5K could , therefore , provide a link between Rho and the stimulation of both new actin poly - merization and of focal adhesions assembly . Additionally , [ Val " % ] Rho and PI - 4 - P5K both induce ERM phosphorylation when overexpressed in ﬁbroblasts , suggesting that Rho activation of PI - 4 - P5K may also be a mechanism by which Rho activates ERM proteins [ 139 ] . Cytokinesis also depends on the assembly of contractile actin – myosin ﬁlaments and has been shown to be Rho - dependent in Xenopus and sand - dollar ( ﬂat sea - urchin ) embryos [ 38 , 39 ] . Rho is recruited to the cleavage furrow of Swiss3T3 cells during cytokinesis [ 148 ] and may utilize some of the same eﬀector proteins required for stress - ﬁbre formation . ROK , for example , phosphorylates and disassembles the intermediate ﬁlament protein glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein to allow cleavage to occur [ 149 ] , and a dominant - negative ROK construct ( containing a mutant Rho - binding domain fused to the PH domain ) inhibits cytokinesis when injected into Xenopus embryos and mammalian cells [ 150 ] . Mammalian Dia may be involved in cytokinesis , since it has been detected at the cleavage furrow in mitotic Swiss3T3 cells [ 141 ] , and , in lower eukaryotes , FH - domain proteins are com - monly involved in cytokinesis . For example , the Drosophila homologue , diaphanous , is essential for cytokinesis [ 151 ] , and two yeast formin - family proteins , Bni1p and Bnr1 , are both required downstream of Rho GTPases for bud formation and bni1 bnr1 double mutants are often multinucleate [ 152 ] . Citron kinase , which appears not to play a role in stress - ﬁbre assembly , has been localized to the cleavage furrow in HeLa cells [ 103 ] . Citron kinase , like ROK , contains an N - terminal myotonic dystrophy kinase - like kinase domain ( 46 % identity with ROK a ) , a central coiled - coil region , a Rho - binding domain ( with no homology with ROK ) , a Cys - rich region , a PH domain and , unlike ROK , a Pro - rich SH3 domain - binding region [ 102 , 103 ] . Truncations of citron kinase lacking the Rho - binding domain inhibit cytokinesis in HeLa cells , producing multinucleate cells [ 103 ] , suggesting that this kinase acts downstream of Rho speciﬁcally at the cleavage furrow . Whether citron phosphoryl - ates a distinct subset of proteins from ROK , in order to fulﬁl its role in cytokinesis , is unknown . Cdc42 effectors implicated in actin reorganization WASP is expressed in haematopoetic cells , and is the product of the X - linked immunodeﬃciency gene found in Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome ( [ 153 , 154 ] , but see [ 153a ] ) . The more ubiquitously expressed ( neuronally enriched ) N - WASP , like WASP , also binds to Cdc42 [ 100 , 155 , 156 ] . WASP and N - WASP each contain an N - terminal PH domain , followed by WASP - homology domain 1 ( WH1 ) , a CRIB domain , an SH3 - binding proline - rich sequence , a WH2 domain containing verprolin - like sequences and an acidic C - terminus to which Arp2 } 3 binds ( see below ) . It was observed that overexpression of N - WASP plus Cdc42 induces very long microspikes , like an exaggeration of Cdc42 activity [ 97 ] , suggesting that these proteins may be involved in the formation of ﬁlopodia downstream of Cdc42 . N - WASP binds to proﬁlin , and WASP and N - WASP bind directly to actin monomers through theirverprolin - like WH2domains [ 94 , 157 , 158 ] . A WASP binding partner , WASP - interacting protein ( ‘WIP’ ) , which also binds to proﬁlin and causes actin polymerization in BJAB cells may also be involved [ 159 ] . Recently it has been found that WASP } N - WASP , the yeast homologue Bee1p and the WASP - like Scar proteins ( which do not contain a Cdc42 - binding domain ) , bind directly to , and activate , the Arp2 } 3 complex via their acidic C - terminus [ 94 , 95 , 160 ] . The Arp2 } 3 complex binds to actin monomers and acts as a nucleation site for new actin polymerization [ 161 , 162 ] . Furthermore , Cdc42 - GTP has been shown to induce actin polymerization in (cid:138) itro , in extracts from Xenopus , the cellular slime mould Dictostelium discoideum or polymorphonuclear leucocytes [ 163 , 164 ] , and biochemical disection of this process has revealed that the Arp2 } 3 complex and N - WASP are required [ 96 ] . Thus , WASP } N - WASP is activated by Cdc42 ( plus lipids ) and can then act as a scaﬀold to recruit the machinery required for new actin polymerization , actin monomers } proﬁlin , and the Arp2 } 3 complex ( Figure 4 ) . Cdc42 also interacts with two Ser } Thr kinases that are thought to be involved in actin reorganization and ﬁlopodia formation , MRCKs a and b . MRCKs are Cdc42 - speciﬁc eﬀector pro - teins which contain a PH domain and a ROK - like kinase domain which can phosphorylate MLC . Kinase - dead MRCK a inhibits Cdc42 - induced ﬁlopodia , and overexpression of MRCK a synergizes with Cdc42 to induce large ﬁlopodia in HeLa cells [ 104 ] . The Drosophila homologue of MRCK , Genghis Khan ( ‘GEK’ ) is known to be required for cytoskeletal regulation during oogenesis [ 165 ] . Another protein that is able to synergize with Cdc42 to produce large ﬁlopodia - like structures is the new PAK family member PAK4 [ 81 ] . PAK4 has a CRIB motif ( see Figure 1a ) and a kinase domain similar to PAKs 1 – 3 , but its sequence is divergent outside of these regions . PAK4 acts quite diﬀerently to PAKs 1 – 3 , in that it binds to Cdc42 and not to Rac , and it is not activated by GTPase binding . Rac effectors implicated in actin reorganization To date there are few examples of unique Rac eﬀectors that have been implicated in actin reorganization . POR - 1 ( P artner o f R ac ) has been implicated in Rac - induced lamellipodia formation , since truncations act as dominant negative constructs [ 166 , 167 ] , and p140Sra - 1 ( S peciﬁc R ac1 - a ssociated protein ) co - sediments with F - actin , implying a role in Rac - induced actin reorganization [ 168 ] . However , little more is known about the cellular functions of these two proteins . A better characterized target of Rac is PI - 4 - P5K . Rac interacts directly with PI - 4 - P5K , though this in - teraction is not GTP - dependent [ 169 ] . It has been established , using permeabilized platelets , that thrombin - induced actin - ﬁ - lament assembly requires actin - ﬁlament uncapping , which is absolutely dependent upon an increase in PIP # levels , and that this is mediated by Rac activation of a type I PI - 4 - P5K [ 170 , 171 ] . Interestingly a WASP - like Verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE , also known as Scar ) can be precipitated with Rac , though it is not known if this is through a direct interaction . WAVE localizes to membrane ruﬄes , and its overexpression causes actin clusters , an activity which requires the proﬁlin - binding and verprolin - homology ( actin - binding ) domains . A verprolin - homology - domain mutant of WAVE inhibits Rac - induced ruﬄing , further suggesting an in (cid:138) i (cid:138) o link between Rac and WAVE [ 172 ] . WAVE , like WASP } N - WASP , has been shown to interact with , and activate , the Arp2 } 3 complex through its C - terminal acidic domain ( see Figure 4 ) [ 94 , 95 ] , but so far it # 2000 Biochemical Society 249 Rho GTPases and their eﬀector proteins WAVE PIP 2 Release of capping proteins Actin nucleation and polymerization Decreased actomyosin contraction Lamellipodia and membrane ruffles Filopodia microspikes Actin filament stabilization Actin nucleation and polymerization Profilin G - actin Arp2 / 3 complex Rac ?

Rac and Cdc42 effectors implicated in actin reorganization Some common target proteins appear to be utilized by both Rac and Cdc42 in the induction of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia respectively . PAK1 , 2 , 3 are Ser } Thr kinases , related to yeast Ste20 , which have received a great deal of detailed attention [ 72 , 173 , 174 ] . In (cid:138) itro , PAK1 and 3 bind equally well to Cdc42 and Rac , though Cdc42 simulates PAK1 activity more strongly than does Rac [ 173 ] . PAK2 only inhibits the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rac , and not Cdc42 , suggesting that it may be a Rac target [ 175 ] . However , it is diﬃcult to decide whether PAK1 , 2 , 3 are targets for Rac , Cdc42 or both in (cid:138) i (cid:138) o from these in (cid:138) itro interactions . There have been conﬂicting reports linking PAKs to actin changes . Activated mutants of PAK1 have been reported to induce both ﬁlopodia and membrane ruﬄes in Swiss3T3 cells and to cause neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells , similar to the eﬀects of constitutively active Cdc42 and Rac [ 176 , 177 ] . PAK1 has been seen to localize to membrane ruﬄes , as well as phagocytic actin - containing cups , in N - formylmethionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine - stimulated neutrophils [ 178 ] . Interestingly , PAK - induced cytoskeletal changes are partly independent of its kinase activity , but require membrane targetting [ 176 , 177 , 179 ] . Other groups , however , have failed to ﬁnd any eﬀects of PAK over - expression on the actin cytoskeleton ( [ 58 , 59 ] , but see [ 59a ] ) , and , taken together , these results suggest that PAKs are capable of aﬀecting the actin cytoskeleton but that they only do so in co - operation with other signals that may or may not be present in the cell lines tested . A variety of substrates for PAKs have been identiﬁed that could aﬀect the actin cytoskeleton . Rac , like Rho , induces phosphorylation of LIMK [ 180 ] , and PAK1 has been shown to phosphorylate LIMK in (cid:138) itro [ 181 ] . Also , an inactive form of LIMK has been shown to inhibit both Cdc42 and Rac induced actin changes [ 182 ] , suggesting that coﬁlin phosphorylation may be a general requirement in Rho GTPase pathways ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . PAK has been reported to phosphorylate and inactivate MLC kinase , decreasing MLC phosphorylation and reducing actomyosin assembly ( Figure 4 ) [ 183 ] . There has also been a report of Rac - induced phosphorylation of myosin II heavy chain , which potentially would also lead to loss of actomyosin ﬁlaments [ 127 ] . Dominant - negative PAK inhibits this phos - phorylation , but active PAK does not reconstitute the eﬀect , suggesting that multiple eﬀectors may mediate this activity [ 184 ] . IQGAP1 and 2 ( named GAPs because of some homology with Ras GAP ) are eﬀectors for Rac and Cdc42 and may be involved in actin polymerization [ 63 , 185 , 186 ] . IQGAP has been detected in a complex with F - actin and Cdc42 , which is enhanced by EGF and disrupted by dominant - negative Cdc42 [ 99 ] . IQGAP is able to oligomerize and to cross - link F - actin in (cid:138) itro , an activity which is enhanced by GTP [ S ] – Cdc42 [ 115 ] . It has , therefore , been suggested that IQGAP oligomers may form upon binding to GTPase after dissociation of calmodulin , and that somehow this facilitates cross - linking of F - actin . In yeast an IQGAP homo - # 2000 Biochemical Society 250 A . L . Bishop and A . Hall logue , Iqg1 } Cyk1p , is involved in actin recruitment to the bud neck [ 187 ] , and in Dictyostelium DdGAP1 , also IQGAP - like , regulates cytokinesis [ 188 ] . Whether IQGAP is involved in cytokinesis in mammalian cells is unknown [ 189 ] . Effectors involved in actin - independent activities of Rho GTPases Overexpression of activated Rac and Cdc42 leads to activation of the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways in a variety of cell types [ 49 , 50 , 190 ] . JNK activation by certain growth factors and cytokines [ e . g . EGF , tumour necrosis factor a ( TNF a ) and transforming growth factor b ] has been reported to be inhibited by dominant - negative Rac and Cdc42 [ 49 , 191 ] , but it is still not clear how general the role of Rac } Cdc42 is in JNK activation . In Swiss3T3 cells , for example , TNF a induction of JNK is not dependent on Cdc42 [ 192 ] . Which Cdc42 } Rac eﬀectors mediate JNK activation in mammalian cells is still unclear . In Drosophila there is good genetic evidence for a link from DRac1 and DCdc42 , via mis - shapen ( PAK - like ) , to hemipterous ( a JNK kinase ) , a pathway that is essential for dorsal closure [ 193 , 194 ] . Also , in yeast , a PAK - like kinase , Ste20 , acts downstream of Cdc42 and is required for activation of the Kss1p } Fus3p MAP kinase cascade in the mating - pheromone response [ 195 , 196 ] . While mammalian PAK1 has been observed to enhance p38 activation when co - expressed with Rac and Cdc42 , and constitutively active PAK1 and PAK3 has been reported to activate JNK in COS cells [ 197 , 198 ] , many other groups have failed to ﬁnd PAK activation of JNK or p38 ( [ 57 , 59 , 61 , 199 ] , but see [ 59a ] ) . Additional Rac } Cdc42 targets which may mediate JNK ac - tivation are : ( 1 ) Mlks 1 , 2 and 3 , which contain CRIB motifs and act as MAP kinase kinase kinases ( MEKKs ) [ 60 , 69 , 200 , 201 ] ; ( 2 ) MEKK1 and MEKK4 , which also interact with Rac and Cdc42 ( MEKK4 has a CRIB domain ) . All are strong activators of JNK when overexpressed , and inhibitory - kinase - dead MEKK1 or MEKK4 mutants block Rac } Cdc42 - induced JNK [ 202 ] . How - ever , to date no physiological link has been made between Rac } Cdc42 and Mlk1 , Mlk2 and Mlk3 or MEKK1 and MEKK4 . All three Rho GTPases have been implicated in the assembly and } or maintenance of cell – cell contacts [ 53 ] . In general the mechanisms mediating these eﬀects are unknown ; however , a recent report suggests that IQGAP1 may be involved [ 54 ] . IQGAP1 appears to interact with b - catenin , preventing its association with a - catenin ; free IQGAP ( i . e . not bound to Cdc42 or Rac ) could , therefore destabilize cell – cell contacts [ 203 , 204 ] . Finally , Rac is known to be a regulator of the NADPH oxidase complex , a specialized enzyme of phagocytic cells that generates oxygen radicals to kill internalized micro - organisms [ 51 , 205 , 206 ] . A cytoplasm - derived component of the oxidase complex , p67 phox , binds directly to Rac [ 207 ] . Data suggest that the role of Rac is not to promote relocalization of this cytoplasmic protein to the membrane - bound catalytic components , as was ﬁrst thought , but rather to act as an allosteric regulator by inducing a conformational change in the preformed complex to promote catalytic activity [ 63 ] . Conclusions In conclusion , the wide range of Rho GTPase activities identiﬁed to date ( see above and Table 1 ) is reﬂected in the large number of cellular targets with which they interact . Over 30 have now been identiﬁed ( see Table 2 ) , and it is likely that the list is not complete . The three - dimensional analysis of GTPase - eﬀector complexes has increased our understanding of how a Rho GTPase can interact with many diﬀerent eﬀector proteins in a speciﬁc manner . However , to date only three eﬀectors , PKN , WASP and ACK , have been analysed in this way , and these studies have all used isolated GTPase - binding domains and not full - length eﬀector proteins . An emerging theme is that eﬀectors can be activated by Rho GTPases through the relief of auto - inhibitory sequences . Clearlyan analysis ofthefull - length eﬀector proteins , carried out in solution , will be required to fully characterize the consequences of GTPases binding to their targets . Another potentially common feature , already demon - strated for PAK , is that additional cellular activities , such as kinases or other protein – protein interactions , can inﬂuence eﬀector activity ( see Figure 2 ) . Progress has been made in identifying the cellular contributions of a handful of eﬀectors . The clearest links downstream of Rho GTPases are in the area of cytoskeletal reorganization , where some targets appear to be essential ( see Figures 3 and 4 ) , while others have been shown to have the potential to be involved ( see above ) . Another interesting possibility is that a Rho GTPase might interact with diﬀerent subsets of eﬀectors depending upon the cellular context and possibly upon the mechanism of activation ; the large family of Rho GEFs could possibly contribute to such variations . A future challenge , so far not really addressed , will be to understand the spatial and temporal control of GTPase activity and the co - operation of Rho GTPases with other signalling networks . Finally , added to this complexity it should be remembered that Rho , Rac and Cdc42 are only three members of the Rho GTPase family : the functions of the seven other members awaits serious investigation .
