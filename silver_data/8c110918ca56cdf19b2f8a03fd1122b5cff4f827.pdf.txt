The molecular mechanism underlying the rapid matura - tion of these endocytic pits is not known . Here we demonstrate that synaptojanin - 1 , and its partner endophilin - A , function in ultrafast endocytosis . In the absence of synaptojanin or endophilin , the mem - brane is rapidly invaginated , but pits do not become constricted at the base . The 5 - phosphatase activity of synaptojanin is involved in formation of the neck , but 4 - phosphatase is not required . Nevertheless , these pits are eventually cleaved into vesicles ; within a 30 - s interval , synaptic endosomes form and are resolved by clathrin - mediated budding . Then synap - tojanin and endophilin function at a second step to aid with the removal of clathrin coats from the regen - erated vesicles . These data together suggest that synaptojanin and endophilin can mediate membrane remodeling on a millisecond timescale during ultra - fast endocytosis . INTRODUCTION Although classic ultrastructural studies suggest that synaptic vesicles are recycled by clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Heuser and Reese , 1973 ; Miller and Heuser , 1984 ) , recent morphological studies indicate that synaptic vesicle membranes in at least several synaptic types are recycled by ultrafast endocytosis ( Watanabe et al . , 2013a , 2013b ) . Optogenetic stimulation fol - lowed by rapid freezing , called ‘‘ﬂash - and - freeze , ’’ can capture the progress of endocytosis with millisecond temporal resolution in electron micrographs . Ultrafast endocytosis can recover membrane as rapidly as 30 – 300 ms after stimulation at the lateral edge of active zones . This rapid process of endocytosis does not require clathrin , but it is only observed at physiological tempera - tures ; at room temperature , clathrin - mediated endocytosis prevails ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . Ultrafast endocytosis can also be observed in low - noise capacitance measurements in cere - bellar and hippocampal mossy ﬁber synapses ( Delvendahl et al . , 2016 ) . After a 10 - Hz stimulation , endocytosis slows to a fast time constant of 760 ms and a slow time constant of 26 s even at 37 (cid:1) C when measured using rapid quenching ( Soykan et al . , 2017 ) . After ultrafast endocytosis , the (cid:3) 80 - nm vesicles translocate to the distal edge of the synapse ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . Because the ﬂuid phase marker ferritin is found in a large endosome - like structure ( (cid:3) 120 nm ) , either endocytic vesicles fuse together via homotypic fusion or fuse to a pre - existing organelle to form the synaptic endosome . Clathrin - coated vesi - cles then bud off from the synaptic endosomes , and synaptic vesicles are recovered by shedding these clathrin coats ( Wata - nabe et al . , 2014 ) . Genetic knockout of AP2 results in the accu - mulation of endosomes in these terminals ( Gu et al . , 2008 , 2013 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ) , further supporting the idea that clathrin functions at endosomes for vesicle regeneration . These data suggest that action potential - induced vesicle endocytosis is fast and clathrin - independent . Despite its rapid timescale , the coordinated actions of multiple proteins are likely required to generate vesicles via ultrafast endocytosis . Membrane invagination requires polymerized actin . Latrunculin - A sequesters monomeric G - actin and inhibits polymerization ; when applied to mouse hippocampal neurons , membrane buckling fails completely ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) . Vesicle scission is likely mediated by dynamin because temper - ature - sensitive mutants or pharmacological inhibition of dyna - min traps endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane ( Wata - nabe et al . , 2013a , 2013b ) . However , apart from actin and dynamin , the protein machinery required for ultrafast endocy - tosis is not understood . 1184 Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 ª 2018 Elsevier Inc . Two proteins thought to function with dynamin are endophilin and synaptojanin . Endophilin - A ( hereafter called endophilin ) is composed of a Bin Amphiphysin , Rvs ( BAR ) domain and an SH3 domain ( de Heuvel et al . , 1997 ; Ringstad et al . , 1997 , 2001 ) . BAR domains can bind and tubulate membranes in vitro ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Frost et al . , 2009 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) , and the SH3 domain binds the proline - rich domain of dynamin ( Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ) . Perturbation studies indicate that endophilin is required for endocytosis in lampreys ( Gad et al . , 2000 ) , ﬂies ( Verstreken et al . , 2002 ) , worms ( Schuske et al . , 2003 ) , mice ( Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) , and yeast ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . In studies of synapses in endophilin mutants , there was a depletion of synaptic vesicles and an accumulation of coated vesicles . Furthermore , endophilin functions in clathrin - independent endocytosis to mediate rapid internalization of receptors from the surface ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , it is a particularly interesting candidate to investigate in the context of ultrafast endocytosis , in which the steps of mem - brane endocytosis and clathrin - mediated vesicle formation are separated in both time and space ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . The SH3 domain of endophilin also binds the proline - rich domain of synaptojanin - 1 ( hereafter called synaptojanin ) ( Mi - cheva et al . , 1997 ; Verstreken et al . , 2003 ) . Genetic studies indi - cate that synaptojanin plays a role in endocytosis in mice ( Cre - mona et al . , 1999 ; Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) , worms ( Harris et al . , 2000 ) , ﬂies ( Dickman et al . , 2005 ; Verstreken et al . , 2003 ) , and yeast ( Stefan et al . , 2005 ) . In studies of synapses , synaptojanin mutants exhibit a decrease in total synaptic vesicle numbers and an accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicles , like in endophi - lin mutants . Endophilin and synaptojanin work cooperatively in endocytosis and subsequent uncoating of clathrin because dou - ble mutants are identical to single mutants ( Schuske et al . , 2003 ; Verstreken et al . , 2003 ) . Synaptojanin contains two phosphoino - sitide phosphatase domains ( McPherson et al . , 1996 ) : a Sacl - like phosphatase that acts on the 3 and 4 positions on the inositol ring and 5 - phosphatase , which acts on the 5 position on the inositol ring ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Nemoto et al . , 2001 ) . Both domains are critical for endocytosis and clathrin uncoating during cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis ( Cao et al . , 2017 ; Mani et al . , 2007 ) . Here we use ﬂash - and - freeze electron microscopy in mouse hippocampal neurons to examine the roles of synaptojanin and endophilininultrafastendocytosis . Inbothmutants , theendocytic membrane is stalled at the plasma membrane for an extended period of time ( 1 – 10 s ) but is resolved by 30 s . In both endophilin and synaptojanin mutants , synaptic vesicles still form by cla - thrin - mediated budding from synaptic endosomes , but removal ofclathrinfromthesevesiclesisdelayed . Thefailuretofullyacidify synaptic vesicles in these mutants suggests that acidiﬁcation of synaptic vesicles takes place after clathrin - coats are removed . Taken together , these data suggest that endophilin and synapto - janinplaydualrolesduringsynapticvesiclerecycling : neckforma - tion during ultrafast endocytosis and clathrin uncoating following regeneration of synaptic vesicles from endosomes . RESULTS Synaptojanin Is Required for Rapid Vesicle Formation Mice with null mutations in synaptojanin die perinatally ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . To determine the role of synaptojanin in ultrafast endocytosis , we cultured hippocampal neurons from synaptoja - nin knockout animals ( Synj1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) ; Cremona et al . , 1999 ) and wild - type animals ( Synj1 + / + ) prepared from the same litters ( n = 3 cultures ) . Cultures were infected using a lentivirus expressing a variant of channelrhodopsin , ChetaTC ( Berndt et al . , 2011 ; Gunaydin et al . , 2010 ) . Cultured neurons were exposed to a 10 - ms pulse of light , and the subsequent membrane dynamics were captured by freezing the neurons at deﬁned time points from 30 ms to 30 s after stimulation ( 37 (cid:1) C , 4 mM Ca 2 + ) . Inwild - typeneurons , endocyticstructureswereobservedatthe lateral edge of the active zone 100 ms after stimulation in 27 % of the synapses ( 58 of 215 synapses ; Figures 1A and S1A ) , consis - tent with previous measures of ultrafast endocytosis ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) . At this time , endocytic pits were typically deeply invaginated ( pit depth , 71 . 0 ± 1 . 8 nm ; 25 of 58 endocytic struc - tures ; Figure 1E ) or fully internalized as large endocytic vesicles ( diameter , 66 . 3 ± 1 . 9 nm ; 33 of 58 endocytic structures ; Figures 1A , 1C , 1G , and S1A ) . 300 ms after stimulation , endocytic pits were almost completely absent ( endocytic pits , 3 of 208 synap - ses ) , and only large endocytic vesicles were present at endocytic sites ( large endocytic vesicles near the active zone , 14 of 208 synapses ; Figure 1C ) , suggesting that ultrafast endocytosis is largely complete by this time point . These endocytic vesicles were then translocated to the center of the bouton to fuse and become synaptic endosomes , which are plentiful from (cid:3) 300 ms to 1 s ( 300 ms , 56 of 208 synapses ; 1 s , 57 of 210 synapses ; and 3 s , 38 of 210 synapses ) . These synaptic endosomes were resolved by clathrin - mediated budding into coated vesicles start - ing at (cid:3) 3 s post - stimulation ( Figures 1A , 1C , and S1A ) . In synaptojanin mutant neurons , endocytic pits also formed 100 ms after stimulation and were localized at the lateral edge of the active zone in 15 % of the synapses ( 43 of 287 synapses ; Figures 1B , 1D , and S1B ) . However , fully resolved large endocytic vesicles were rarely observed at these sites ( 2 of 43 endocytic structures ; Figure 1G ) , and unresolved endocytic pits remained at the plasma membrane for 1 – 10 s ( Figure 1D ) . These endocytic pits were slightly shallower and wider than in wild - type neurons ( Figures 1E and 1F ; pit depth : Synj1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , 62 . 4 ± 2 . 8 nm , wild - type [ WT ] , 71 . 0 ± 1 . 8 nm , p < 0 . 05 ; pit width : Synj1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , 126 . 1 ± 5 . 4 nm , n = 44 pits ; wild - type 111 . 7 ± 9 . 2 nm , n = 25 pits ; p = 0 . 19 ) . Moreover , in the wild - type neurons , necks narrowed to 0 nm ; in synaptojanin mutants , the neck was never narrower than 38 . 3 nm . These data suggest that formation of a neck during vesicle invagination requires synaptojanin . The Membrane Is Ultimately Internalized In Synaptojanin Mutants Do the pits eventually resolve into endocytic vesicles or do they collapse back into the plasma membrane ? Large endocytic vesicles were occasionally observed at synaptojanin mutant synapses between 100 ms and 10 s ( 17 of 1 , 034 synapses ; Fig - ure 1D ) . Because large endocytic vesicles are very transient ( (cid:3) 200 ms ) , they can only be observed immediately after their for - mation . The temporal resolution of our ultrastructural analysis is too coarse after 1 s to reliably capture such transient structures . However , the eventual appearance of synaptic endosomes and coated vesicles , albeit with a delay , suggests that endocytosis proceeds in synaptojanin mutants ( Figures 1B , 1D , and S1B ) . Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 1185 To track endocytic structures , we applied cationized ferritin particles in the external solution and performed ﬂash - and - freeze experiments ( single stimulus , 37 (cid:1) C , 4 mM Ca 2 + ) . In wild - type neurons , ferritin particles are in endocytic vesicles at 100 ms ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) , endosomes at 1 s , and clathrin - coated vesicles at 3 s ( Figures 2A , 2B , and S2A ) . Thus , the presence of ferritin particles in large endocytic vesicles or synaptic endo - somes by 1 s poststimulation suggests successful completion of ultrafast endocytosis . In synaptojanin mutant neurons , ferritin particles are almost exclusively found in endocytic pits at 1 s ( Figures 2C , 2D , and S2B ) . At 3 s , a decline in endocytic pits at the plasma membrane is observed in synaptojanin mutants , and this decrease is corre - lated with a concomitant increase in ferritin in organelles within the bouton ( Figure 2D ) . These organelles include large endocytic vesicles ( 10 of 170 synapses , 60 – 80 nm ) , but they are not close to the plasma membrane ( 233 . 2 ± 26 . 3 nm on average ) , suggest - ing that they are rapidly trafﬁcked away from the endocytic zone . Ferritin is also observed in large synaptic endosomes ( > 100 nm ) at 3 s and in a few clathrin - coated vesicles that have budded from the synaptic endosomes . By contrast , clathrin - coated pits are not observed on the plasma membrane ( Figure 2D ) , suggest - ing that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is not compensating for defective ultrafast endocytosis in synaptojanin mutants .

Wild - type neurons are from Synj1 + / + littermates in all cases . 1186 Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 results suggest that ultrafast endocytosis is slowed but not blocked in the absence of synaptojanin and that , eventually , ves - icles are regenerated by clathrin - mediated budding from the synaptic endosome . Synaptojanin Is Required for Removing Clathrin from Coated Vesicles There is a second requirement for synaptojanin during uncoating of vesicles . In wild - type synapses , clathrin - coated vesicles appear 3 s after stimulation and are largely gone by 10 s ( Figures 1A and 1C ) . Synaptic endosomes exhibit a precur - sor - product relationship with coated vesicles because the decrease in synaptic endosomes with ferritin is associated with a concomitant increase in coated vesicles containing ferritin ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . By contrast , in synaptojanin mu - tants , a high abundance of clathrin - coated vesicles is observed even in unstimulated synapses ( Figure 1H ) . After stimulation , additional clathrin - coated vesicles began accumulating at 3 s and continued to increase at 30 s ( Figures 1B , 1D , 2C , and 2D ) . Previous studies have demonstrated that coated vesicles accumulate in synaptojanin mutants at rest ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Harris et al . , 2000 ; Verstreken et al . , 2003 ) .

Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 1187 extend these ﬁndings and demonstrate that synaptojanin is required for the uncoating of synaptic vesicles following ultra - fast endocytosis after an acute stimulus . Differential Requirements for 5 - Phosphatase and 4 - Phosphatase Activities Synaptojanin contains two phosphoinositide phosphatase do - mains . The Sac1 phosphatase domain cleaves the 4 - phosphate from phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) and the 3 - phos - phate from phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) and phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) , and the 5 - phosphatase domain cleaves the 5 - phosphate from phos - phatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and phosphatidy - linositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Nemoto et al . , 2001 ) . To test whether the activities of these domains are required for ultrafast endocytosis , we generated full - length rescue constructs in the 145 - kD isoform with either wild - type or mutant versions of each of the phosphatase active sites , as described previously ( Mani et al . , 2007 ) . Synaptojanin mutant neurons were infected with these constructs ( Figure S2F ) and subjected to ﬂash - and - freeze electron microscopy ( single stimulus , 37 (cid:1) C , 4 mM Ca 2 + ) . In all cases , expression of these constructs did not alter excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) ( Figure S2G ) . Expression of full - length synaptojanin completely rescues the endocytic defect observed in synapto - janin - null mutants ( Figures 2E , 2F , and S2C ) . The Sac1 - dead synaptojanin ( SYNJ1 C383S ) rescued the endocytic defect , suggesting that Sac1 activity is not required for ultrafast endo - cytosis ( Figures 2G , 2H , and S2D ) . By contrast , the 5 - phospha - tase - dead synaptojanin ( SYNJ1 D730A ) failed to rescue the defect in ultrafast endocytosis ( Figures 2I , 2J , and S2E ) , suggesting that ultrafast endocytosis requires removal of the 5 - phosphate group from the inositol ring of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Previous experiments have suggested that clathrin - mediated endocytosis at synaptic terminals requires the 5 - phosphatase activity of synaptojanin ( Dong et al . , 2015 ; Mani et al . , 2007 ) . Our results indicate that the 5 - phosphatase is required for ultrafast endocytosis . Formation and resolution of the synaptic endosome into clathrin - coated vesicles appears to be normal in synaptojanin mutants , but removing the clathrin coat requires the activity of both phosphatases . In Sac1 - dead neurons , vesicles with ferritin all retained their coats after budding from endosomes ( Figures 2E – 2H , and S2D ) ; thus , the 4 - phosphatase is required to uncoat vesicles generated from the synaptic endosome after acute stimulation . These data are consistent with the chronic accumu - lation of coated vesicles observed in a mutant lacking function in the Sac1 domain ( Cao et al . , 2017 ) . In 5 - phosphatase - dead neurons , all synaptic vesicle - sized structures with ferritin also re - tained coats , suggesting a profound defect in uncoating in these synapses ( Figures 2I , 2J , 3H , and S2E ) . Together , these data suggest that both the 4 - phosphatase and 5 - phosphatase are required for uncoating vesicles . However , it is possible that only the 4 - phosphatase acts during uncoating and that the defect observed in the 5 - phosphatase mutant is indirect . Because the Sac1 phosphatase cannot cleave the 4 - phosphate in the presence of the 5 - phosphate ( Guo et al . , 1999 ) , then failure to cleave the 5 - phosphate during endocytosis would block Sac1 activity during uncoating . Acidiﬁcation of Vesicles after Clathrin Uncoating To determine endocytic rates of synaptic vesicle proteins rather than membranes , we assayed quenching of pHluorin - tagged synaptophysin . After synaptic vesicles are regenerated , they are acidiﬁed by the vacuolar ATPase , and ﬂuorescence is quenched ( Balaji and Ryan , 2007 ; Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Miesen - bo¨ck et al . , 1998 ) . These assays are performed using high - fre - quency stimulation using 10 – 100 action potentials to obtain a signiﬁcant fraction of vesicle proteins on the surface . Similar stimulation protocols induce multiple rounds of ultrafast endocy - tosis ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) . However , in the pHluorin assay , the decay in ﬂuorescence depends on the rate of synaptophysin translocation to an endocytic site , the speed of endocytosis , and the rate of acidiﬁcation . Because decay in ﬂuorescence is an indirect measure of endocytosis , speeds measured by electron microscopy will be faster than observed for ﬂuorescence decay . Cultured neurons expressing synaptophysin - pHluorin ( sypHy ) were perfused with extracellular solution at 35 (cid:1) C and stimulated with either 10 action potentials at 20 Hz ( 0 . 5 s ) or 75 action poten - tials at 10 Hz ( 7 . 5 s ) . The time constant for ﬂuorescence decay in wild - type neurons following 10 action potentials was (cid:3) 8 s ( 20 Hz at 35 (cid:1) C ) ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Similarly , the time constant for ﬂuo - rescence decay following 75 action potentials ( 10 Hz at 35 (cid:1) C ) was (cid:3) 9 s in the wild - type ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . However , 75 action potentials increased the signal - to - noise ratio substantially compared with 10 action potentials ; this protocol was used thereafter . Endocytosis of proteins is greatly accelerated at physiological temperatures ( Balaji et al . , 2008 ; Soykan et al . , 2017 ) . We also note that the time constant for ﬂuorescence decay accelerates from (cid:3) 20 s at 22 (cid:1) C to (cid:3) 9 s at 35 (cid:1) C ( Fig - ure S2H ) , similar in magnitude to previous studies . pHluorin quenching rates were determined for the synaptoja - nin mutant strain - expressing variants . Quenching of pHluorin is strongly defective in synaptojanin - null synapses ( Figure 3A ) , consistent with previous experiments ( Mani et al . , 2007 ) . Expres - sion of the wild - type synaptojanin protein in Synj1 – neurons fully rescued acidiﬁcation ( Figures 3E and 3H ; 75 action potentials , wild - type t = 9 s , Synj1 – t = 49 s , Synj1 – SYNJ1 + t = 7 s , p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 3D ; 10 action potentials , wild - type t = 8 s , Synj1 – t = 48 s , Synj1 – SYNJ1 + t = 13 s , p < 0 . 05 ) . Expression of the 5 - phosphatase ( (cid:4) ) variant did not rescue quenching in the synaptojanin mutant synapses ( Figures 3G and 3H ; 75 action potentials , t = 36 s , p > 0 . 05 ; Figure 3D ; 10 action potentials , t = 73 s ) . Expression of the Sac1 ( (cid:4) ) 5 - phos ( + ) variant exhibited a slight acceleration in quenching relative to the null mutant ( Fig - ures 3D , 3F , 3H , and 3I ) , likely because of the presence of normal rates of ultrafast endocytosis , but this was not reﬂected in a signiﬁcant improvement in the time constant for quenching ( Figure 3D ; 75 action potentials , wild - type 9 s , Synj1 – 49 s , Synj1 – + Sac1 ( (cid:4) ) 36 s , p > 0 . 05 ; Figure 3B ; 10 action potentials , wild - type 8 s , Synj1 – 48 s , Synj1 – + Sac1 ( (cid:4) ) 19 s , not signiﬁcant ) . Notably , in the wild - type , ﬂuorescence reaches baseline in 40 s ( (cid:3) pH 5 . 5 for synaptic vesicles ) , but in the synaptojanin mutants , ﬂuorescence never reached baseline in the course of the exper - iment , and only (cid:3) 50 % of the ﬂuorescence was quenched at 30 s ( Figure 3I ) . In the ﬂash - and - freeze experiments , mutation of either the Sac1 domain or the 5 - phosphatase domain exhibited a defect in vesicle uncoating ( Figures 2G - 2J , S2D and S2E , and 1188 Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 3J ) . The slow quenching observed in both phosphatase mutants suggests that these vesicles with clathrin coats are being acidiﬁed very slowly or , alternatively , that clathrin completely blocks acidiﬁcation and the vesicles are being uncoated asynchronously . Endophilin Mediates Neck Formation during Ultrafast Endocytosis Because synaptojanin functions closely with endophilin , we tested the role of endophilin in ultrafast endocytosis . Synaptic endophilins are encoded by three genes , Sh3gl2 , Sh3gl1 , and Sh3gl3 , in the mouse , encoding endophilin 1 , 2 , and 3 , respec - tively ; the triple mutant is referred to hereafter as EndoA triple knockout [ TKO ] ) to avoid confusion caused by this nomenclature ( Kjaerulff et al . , 2011 ; for complete genotypes , see STAR Methods ) . As shown previously ( Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) , double and triple mutants have a defect in synaptic transmission ( Fig - ure S3A ) , but a sufﬁcient number of synaptic vesicles fuse to trigger compensatory endocytosis . To determine which isoforms function in ultrafast endocytosis , we analyzed single , double , and triple mutants 100 ms and 3 s after stimulation . We found that single mutants are normal but double and triple mutants are defective for ultrafast endocytosis .

Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 1189 and EndoA2 knockout single mutants exhibited normal ultrafast endocytosis ( Figures 4 and S4 ) . Like the wild - type at 100 ms , half of the endocytic structures are already internalized in EndoA1 knockout and EndoA2 knockout ( Figures 4A – 4D , S4A , and S4B ) . By contrast , in the EndoA1 , 2 double knockout ( DKO ) or in the EndoA triple knockout , all endocytic structures are still connected with the plasma membrane 100 ms after stimulation ( Figures 4E – 4H , S4C , and S4D ) . These data suggest that ENDOA1 and ENDOA2 can each mediate endophilin function during ultrafast endocytosis and that ENDOA3 does not contribute signiﬁcantly . To fully characterize the role of endophilin in ultrafast endocy - tosis , we performed a complete time course of ﬂash - and - freeze experiments on the EndoA1 , 2 DKO and EndoA triple knockout . A single stimulus of 10 ms was applied , and cells were frozen at the indicated time points ( Figures 5 and S5 ; 37 (cid:1) C , 4 mM Ca 2 + ) .

Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 1191 ( Figures 5A , 5D , 5F , 5I , and S5A ) . However , pits were still present at 1 s in the mutants ( Figures 5B , 5C , 5E , 5F , S5B , and S5C ) , whereas they were mostly resolved in the wild - type . Similar to the wild - type , the depths of endocytic pits in the mutants were (cid:3) 50 nm ( 100 ms : wild - type 47 . 8 ± 2 . 9 nm ; DKO 48 ± 3 . 6 nm ; tri - ple knockout 54 ± 3 . 0 nm ; Figure 5G ) . Typically , the widths of pits were narrower in the DKO and triple knockout mutants than in the wild - type ( Figure 5H ; mean wild - type 103 . 5 ± 8 . 6 nm , n = 47 pits ; EndoA DKO 89 . 2 ± 6 . 1 nm , n = 38 pits ; EndoA triple knockout 74 . 6 ± 4 . 6 nm , n = 61 pits ) . However , in a substantial fraction of wild - type synapses , the width of the neck was nar - rower than 5 nm ( 10 of 47 pits ; Figures S3B and S3C ) , whereas , in endophilin mutants , none of the necks were smaller than 20 nm , suggesting that endophilin is needed to narrow the neck of the pit as the vesicle forms ( Figures 5B and 5C ; 100 ms and 1 s ) . Ultrafast endocytosis in endophilin DKO and triple knockout mutants is slowed , but pits decline in number after 3 s , although some pits linger until 30 s ( Figures 5D – 5F ) . The decline of pits is not due to failure of endocytosis because the products of endocytosis , large endocytic vesicles and endo - somes , are observed at later time points ( Figures 5B , 5C , S5B , and S5C ) . Clathrin - coated vesicles are formed from synaptic endosomes , but , like synaptojanin mutants , clathrin - coats persist on vesicles ( Figures 5B – 5F and 5J ) , suggesting that en - dophilin is required for clathrin uncoating ( Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) . Coated Vesicles Are Not Acidiﬁed To determine the role of endophilin in acidiﬁcation of synaptic vesicles , we analyzed quenching of pHluorin - tagged synapto - physin in EndoA knockout neurons . Cultured hippocampal neurons from endophilin knockout mice were stimulated at 20 Hz for 0 . 5 s ( Figures 6A and 6B ) or 2 s ( Figures 6C and 6D ) at 35 (cid:1) C . In EndoA DKO and triple knockout neurons , quenching of pHluorin was substantially delayed compared with the EndoA1 knockout rescue ( Figure 6B ; 10 action potentials , DKO t = 73 s , triple knockout t = 55 s , EndoA1 rescue t = 9 s ; Fig - ure 6D ; DKO t = 59 s , triple knockout t = 74 s , EndoA1 rescue t = 12 s , p < 0 . 05 ) . Endophilin A1 and A2 single knockout neurons have kinetics much more similar to the Endo A1 knockout rescue phenotype ( Figure 6B ; 20 action potentials ; EndoA1 knockout t = 8 s , EndoA2 knockout t = 9 s Figures 6D ; 40 action potentials ; EndoA1 knockout t = 13 s , EndoA2 knockout t = 19 s ) . These data suggest that ENDOA1 and ENDOA2 can function indepen - dently to sustain normal synaptic vesicle endocytosis . This is in agreement with our ﬂash - and - freeze data as well as previous data ( Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) , in which the defect in compensatory endocytosis in EndoA triple knockout was rescued by transfec - tion of ENDOA1 alone . These data also demonstrate a correlation between acidiﬁca - tion and uncoating of vesicles . In the pHluorin experiments in the EndoA1 knockout rescue ( 40 action potential stimulus ) , 65 % of the synaptophysin - pHluorin signal was quenched within 10 s and 90 % quenched at 30 s ( Figure 6D ) . These data suggest that uncoated vesicles are acidiﬁed . In pHluorin experiments in endophilin DKO and triple knockout mutants , only 22 % of synap - tophysin - pHluorin was quenched by 10 s after the stimulus and only 48 % and 36 % , respectively , after 30 s ( Figure 6D ) .

See Quantiﬁcation and Statistical Analysis for the detailed n values and numbers . 1192 Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 after the stimulus in these mutants . One interpretation of the pHluorin experiments is that endophilin and synaptojanin are directly required for acidiﬁcation of vesicles . An alternative and simpler interpretation is that only uncoated vesicles can be fully acidiﬁed to the synaptic vesicle pH ( 5 . 5 ) . These data are consis - tent with recent studies demonstrating that the clathrin lattice can block the activity of the vacuolar ATPase ( Farsi et al . , 2018 ) . DISCUSSION After single action potentials at physiological temperature , syn - aptic vesicle membranes are not recycled by clathrin but , rather , by ultrafast endocytosis , which is clathrin - independent ( Delven - dahl et al . , 2016 ; Soykan et al . , 2017 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013a , 2013b , 2014 ) . We ﬁnd that synaptojanin and endophilin are required during ultrafast endocytosis to narrow the neck of an invagination to promote scission of the vesicle from the mem - brane . The speed with which these proteins can act—as rapidly as 30 ms—is surprising ( Watanabe et al . , 2013a ) . The speed of diffusion would normally impose severe limits on the assembly ofproteincomplexes ; however , assemblycouldbegreatlyaccel - eratedbybeingintheenclosedspaceofasynapticvaricosityand localized to membranes ( Yogurtcu and Johnson , 2018 ) . Although ultrafast endocytosis is clathrin - independent , these results also have implications for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Previous morphological studies of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in synaptojanin and endophilin mutants did not reveal defects in endocytosis ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Hayashiet al . , 2008 ; Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) . The problem arises because traditional ﬁxation cannot capture transient events . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is merely slowed in these mutants , not blocked ( Mani et al . , 2007 ) . By using ﬂash - and - freeze electron microscopy , we can capture transient states . Normally , endocytic pits are resolved by300ms , butthesepersistfor30sinsynaptojaninandendophilin mutants . It is likely that the mechanisms for synaptojanin and en - dophilinfunction areconserved inclathrin - mediatedendocytosis . Synaptojanin 5 - Phosphatase Cinches the Neck of Endocytic Pits Synaptojanin possesses two phosphatidylinositol phosphatase domains : the 5 - phosphatase , which removes the phosphate from the 5 position of the inositol ring from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , and the Sac1 domain , which removes phosphates from the 3 or 4 positions of the inositol ring from PI3P , PI4P , or PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Nemoto et al . , 2001 ) . In the synaptojanin - null mutant , ultrafast endocytosis is stalled as shallow pits with a wide base . The 5 - phosphatase - speciﬁc mutant exhibits an identical phenotype as the null , but no endo - cytosis defect is observed in the absence of the 4 - phosphatase . This stepwise conversion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI4P , rather than to phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , is consistent with the progression of phosphoinositides observed in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( He et al . , 2017 ) . The stalled endocytic pits in synaptojanin mutants are eventually resolved by 30 s , demonstrating that loss of the 5 - phosphatase creates a kinetic , rather than an absolute , block of endocytosis . However , we cannot exclude the possibility that another 5 - phosphatase , such as OCRL , eventually functions to resolve the endocytic pit . These data are consistent with studies of ultrafast endocytosis at synapses in the nematode . Ultrafast endocytosis occurs even at room temperature in C . elegans ( Watanabe et al . , 2013a ) and does not require clathrin ( Sato et al . , 2009 ) . In synaptojanin mutants , uncoated pits with broad necks are observed ( Harris et al . , 2000 ) , and the 5 - phosphatase alone is sufﬁcient to rescue evoked responses ( Dong et al . , 2015 ) . These studies indicate that the catalytic activity of Sac1 is dispensable for ultrafast endocytosis . There is a similar requirement for 5 - phosphatase activity during clathrin - mediated endocytosis in cultured cortical neu - rons at 22 (cid:1) C ( Mani et al . , 2007 ) . Endocytosis was assayed by acidiﬁcation of pHluorin - tagged synaptobrevin during or after a stimulation train ( 30 s of 10 Hz ) . Acidiﬁcation during stimulation represents a signiﬁcant fraction of the total protein recovered , more than 50 % , and is strongly dependent on the 5 - phospha - tase but not the 4 - phosphatase activity of synaptojanin . Endocy - tosis and acidiﬁcation occurring after stimulation at 22 (cid:1) C depended on both the 5 - phosphatase and the 4 - phosphatase activity of synaptojanin . These data suggest that clathrin - medi - ated endocytosis requires the 5 - phosphatase during , but not after , stimulation . Alternatively , the 5 - phosphatase - speciﬁc defect could imply that ultrafast endocytosis occurs during stim - ulation even at 22 (cid:1) C . Although we imagine that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis is speciﬁcally needed for endocytosis , it is also possible that the defect in ultra - fast endocytosis observed in synaptojanin mutants is due to an indirect effect of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 accumulation . For example , the NALCN sodium channels appear to be constitutively active in synaptojanin mutants in C . elegans ( Jospin et al . , 2007 ) . Alterna - tively , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 accumulation could increase membrane tension via the cortical actin network ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) . In either case , increased membrane tension because of increased osmolarity or by cortical actin may hinder membrane invagina - tion . However , the fact that loss of endophilin , a membrane - bending protein , leads to the same phenotype suggests that synaptojanin actively participates in membrane reshaping . Genetic studies in C . elegans and in Drosophila suggest that these two proteins function interdependently on the same pro - cess ( Schuske et al . , 2003 ; Verstreken et al . , 2003 ) . Endophilin and Neck Constriction Like the 5 - phosphatase of synaptojanin , endophilin is required to narrow the neck during ultrafast endocytosis . BAR domains can bind and tubulate membranes in vitro ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Frost et al . , 2009 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) ; in addition , endophilin possesses amphipathic helices that insert into the membrane to actively generate curvature ( Capraro et al . , 2013 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Poudel et al . , 2016 ) . We observed that endophilin is required in vivo to cinch the base of endocytic pits from their initial diam - eter of 100 nm to cleavage ; in mutants , the neck is never narrower than 20 nm . Nevertheless , these stalled pits are even - tually resolved by 30 s . There is a similar requirement for endophilin during clathrin - dependent endocytosis at 22 (cid:1) C ( Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) ; specif - ically , endophilin accelerates endocytosis but is not essential for synaptic vesicle regeneration . Recovery of the membrane , measured by pHluorin quenching , was slowed from a time Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 1193 constant of 29 s in the wild - type to 71 s in the endophilin triple knockouts after a 10 - Hz stimulation . Stalled coated pits were not observed in the endophilin mutants at room temperature ; again , because the defect is kinetic rather than absolute , pits would not be expected to appear in electron micrographs . Endophilin also drives another form of clathrin - independent endocytosis called fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) . FEME mediates the recovery of synaptic vesicles at ribbon synapses ( Llobet et al . , 2011 ) and of G - protein and tyro - sine kinase receptors in ﬁbroblasts and epidermal cells ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ; Renard et al . , 2015 ) . In this endocytic pathway , endophilin is thought to recruit cargo by direct interaction via its SH3 domain and to act as a coat protein to generate curvature ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ) . In our experiments , we did not observe a defect in the invagination of membrane , so it is unlikely that endophilin drives invagination during ultrafast endocytosis ; nevertheless , FEME and ultrafast endocytosis may be related , given the rapid speed observed for these mechanisms . Model for Endophilin and Synaptojanin in Vesicle Cleavage The similarity in mutant phenotypes suggests that synaptojanin and endophilin act together during ultrafast endocytosis . More - over , double mutants lacking both synaptojanin and endophilin are identical to single mutants in worms and ﬂies ( Schuske et al . , 2003 ; Verstreken et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) ; knocking out one pro - tein is equivalent to knocking out both . Endophilin is required to recruit synaptojanin to endocytic sites in worms , ﬂies , and mice ( Milosevic et al . , 2011 ; Schuske et al . , 2003 ; Verstreken et al . , 2003 ) . How endophilin recruits synaptojanin is somewhat controversial . In mice , the SH3 domain of endophilin binds the proline - rich domain of synaptojanin and recruits it to the mem - brane ( Frost et al . , 2009 ; Milosevic et al . , 2011 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) , whereas , in C . elegans , the BAR domain of endophilin appears to act via the Sac1 domain of synaptojanin ( Dong et al . , 2015 ) . The ultimate arbiter of vesicle cleavage is undoubtedly dyna - min . Temperature - sensitive mutants or pharmacological inhibi - tion of dynamin leads to stalled pits with narrow necks during ultrafast endocytosis ( Watanabe et al . , 2013a , 2013b ) . It is there - fore likely that endophilin and synaptojanin work together to generate a tubule , less than 20 nm in diameter , that is then a sub - strate for dynamin to cleave the vesicle from the membrane . Apparently , in the absence of synaptojanin or endophilin , dyna - min can eventually cleave the vesicle from the membrane on its own , albeit inefﬁciently . This conclusion is consistent with exper - iments demonstrating that endophilin operates in an additive manner with dynamin to cleave tubules during clathrin - indepen - dent Shiga toxin entry ( Renard et al . , 2015 ) . How might synaptojanin and endophilin work together to pro - mote vesicle formation during ultrafast endocytosis ? A model for endocytosis in yeast suggests that endophilin and synaptojanin create a positive feedback loop that leads to cleavage of the vesicle ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . In this model , the BAR domain of endo - philin preferentially binds high - curvature membranes containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Chang - Ileto et al . , 2011 ; Yoon et al . , 2012 ) and creates a protective collar that blocks its degradation . Synaptojanin is re - cruited to the edge of the collar and begins converting PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI4P . In the proposed model , the neck becomes unstable because of changes in surface tension that can occur in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched membranes , created through hydrogen bonding with water ( Levental et al . , 2008 ) . However , these hydrogen bonds between PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are likely already disrupted under the ionic conditions of the cell , and this model is therefore unlikely to fully account for neck formation . PI4P occupies less than half of the surface area PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 does under normal ionic condi - tions ( Levental et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , it is possible that hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI4P causes the neck to collapse at the interface . In addition , endophilin necks can create a diffusion barrier that slows diffusion of lipids through the collar in vitro ( Simunovic et al . , 2017 ) , and the pulling force generated by actin could possibly contribute to collapse of the neck ( Renard et al . , 2015 ; Simunovic et al . , 2017 ) . As the neck contracts , endophilin is recruited to the increased curvature of the tubule ( Renard et al . , 2015 ) , and the phosphatase activity of synaptojanin is stimulated by increasing curvature ( Chang - Ileto et al . , 2011 ) , thereby closing the positive feedback loop , restricting the diam - eter of the neck and facilitating dynamin - mediated ﬁssion ( Chang - Ileto et al . , 2011 ) . This model would require endophilin to be ﬂexible enough to accommodate tubes of different diame - ters , which is consistent with variable - diameter tubes observed in cryoelectron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) studies of membrane - bound endophilin ( Mim et al . , 2012 ) . The Role of Synaptojanin and Endophilin in Removing Clathrin Coats The original biochemical characterization identiﬁed endophilin as a binding partner of synaptojanin and dynamin ( Micheva et al . , 1997 ; Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) , suggesting that these proteins are involved in the process of membrane cleavage during endocytosis . Surprisingly , ultrastructural characterizations of synaptojanin and endophilin mutants in worms , ﬂies , and mice indicated that these proteins instead play a role in removing clathrin coats from fully formed vesicles ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Harris et al . , 2000 ; Milosevic et al . , 2011 ; Schuske et al . , 2003 ; Verstreken et al . , 2003 ) ; instead of observing stalled coated pits at the plasma membrane , coated vesicles were abundant in the cytoplasm . Our observations resolve these conﬂicting results , but only in part . Rapid freezing after stimulation demon - strated defects in membrane scission during endocytosis , but this does not easily explain how these proteins function in removing clathrin coats from vesicles . The coated vesicles we observe at synapses do not arise via endocytosis at the plasma membrane but , rather , via budding from synaptic endosomes that form after ultrafast endocytosis ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , the mechanism of cla - thrin - mediated budding of synaptic vesicles from an endosome at 37 (cid:1) C is analogous ( and possibly identical ) to clathrin - medi - ated formation of synaptic vesicles from the plasma membrane at 22 (cid:1) C . At 37 (cid:1) C , coated vesicles accumulate after stimulation in synaptojanin and endophilin mutants and do not decline by 30 s , the last time point in our experiments . Both the 4 - phosphatase and the 5 - phosphatase activities of synaptojanin are required for uncoating . A Parkinson’s disease mutation that disrupts the 4 - phosphatase of the Sac1 domain exhibited accumulation of coated vesicles at synapses ( Cao 1194 Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 , June 27 , 2018 et al . , 2017 ) . We found that the 4 - phosphatase is speciﬁcally required for uncoating vesicles but is not required for endocy - tosis . The 5 - phosphatase is also required for uncoating vesicles , in addition to its role in endocytosis . In the simplest model , the 4 - phosphatase and the 5 - phosphatase convert PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI ; depletion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 causes release of the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . In a second model , the 5 - phosphatase speciﬁcally catalyzes disassembly of the clathrin lattice ; the generation of PI4P recruits auxilin , and , in turn , auxilin catalyzes the dissociation of clathrin triskelions from the coated vesicle ( Guan et al . , 2010 ) . However , no defect in recruitment of auxilin was detected in the endophilin mutant ( Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) . In a third model , the 4 - phosphatase acts directly , and the 5 - phosphatase acts indirectly . The Sac1 4 - phosphatase cannot act on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 but only PI4P ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Nemoto et al . , 2001 ) . Conceivably , the 5 - phosphatase could act ﬁrst dur - ing endocytosis to generate PI4P , and the 4 - phosphatase could act during uncoating to generate PI and cause the release of the AP2 complex . It is likely that endophilin plays an indirect role ; it recruits synaptojanin to the vesicle during scission from the endosome . It is important to note that defects in clathrin uncoating can confound pHluorin assays of endocytosis . The clathrin lattice in - hibits the vacuolar - type H + - ATPase ( V - ATPase ) ( Farsi et al . , 2018 ) . Defects in uncoating as well as defects in endocytosis will delayacidiﬁcation . Finally , likeinendocytosis , thelossofsynapto - janin and endophilin does not cause an absolute block in uncoating . Vesicle reacidiﬁcation is slowed but not blocked in these mutants , suggesting that clathrin is being removed during the 30 - s time course of our experiments . Although we did not observefullrecoveryofuncoatedvesiclesinourultrastructuralas - says , functional vesicles musteventually be regenerated because rested synapses cansustain highlevelsofexocytosis . Again , syn - aptojaninandendophilinacceleratetheprocessesofendocytosis and uncoating but are not essential for these processes .

Jorgensen ( jorgensen @ biology . utah . edu ) . EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS All of the experiments were performed according to the rules and regulations of animal use by Berlin , Germany authorities and the National Institute of Health . Primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons with the following genotypes are used in this study : C57 / BL6 - N ; Synj1 KO ( B6 ; 129 - Synj1 tm1Pdc / J ) + / + ; Synj1 KO ( B6 ; 129 - Synj1 tm1Pdc / J ) (cid:4) / (cid:4) ; EndoA1 ( B6 ; 129 - Sh3gl2 tm1Pdc / J ) (cid:4) / (cid:4) , EndoA2 + / + , EndoA3 loxP / loxP ( B6 ; 129 - Sh3gl3 tm1 . 1Itl / J ) ; and EndoA1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , EndoA2 ( B6 ; 129 - Sh3gl1 tm1Pdc / J ) (cid:4) / (cid:4) , EndoA3 loxP / loxP ± cre recombinase . The EndoA2 single KO is EndoA1 , 2 DKO + EndoA1 rescue ; the EndoA1 EndoA2 double mutant is EndoA1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , EndoA2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , EndoA3 loxP / loxP ; the EndoA1 EndoA2 EndoA3 triple mutants is EndoA1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , EndoA2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , EndoA3 loxP / loxP , + Cre . The syn - aptojanin mutation was generated by replacing a genomic fragment containing part of exon 1 and part of intron 1 with a neomycin resistance cassette ; western blot analysis of brain tissue demonstrated that no detectable protein was expressed from this allele ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . Hippocampal neurons were isolated from pups of unspeciﬁed sex at embryonic day 18 or postnatal day 0 .

In the case of endophilin , experimental animals of the genotype EndoA1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , Endo A2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , EndoA3 loxP / loxP and Endo A1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , Endo A2 + / + , and EndoA3 loxP / loxP were generated by crossing EndoA1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , EndoA2 + / (cid:4) , and Endo A3 loxP / loxP animals , which are unaffected as adults ( Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) . For synaptojanin 1 , experimental animals were generated by crossing two Synaptojanin + / (cid:4) animals , which are also unaffected ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . All protocols were approved by the animal welfare committee of the Charite´ Berlin , Germany . METHOD DETAILS Culture To prepare primary cultures from mouse hippocampal neurons , the following procedures were carried out . Cortices were dissected from newborn C57 / BL6 - N mice ( both sex , postnatal day 0 - 1 ) and treated with 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA for 15 min at 37 (cid:1) C to dissociate astrocytes . The dissociated astrocytes were grown in a 37 (cid:1) C incubator ( 5 % CO 2 ) to conﬂuency in a T - 75 ﬂask with 13 mL DMEM culture media containing 10 % FBS and 0 . 2 % penicillin - streptomycin for 1 - 2 weeks . These astrocytes were then seeded at 3 . 3x10 4 cells / ml on 22 - mm coverslips for pHluorin imaging and 6 - mm sapphire disks for ﬂash - and - freeze experiments . Both cover - slips and sapphire disks were placed in the wells of 12 - well plates and coated with poly - D - lysine ( 1mg / ml ) solution containing rat tail collagen ( 1 ml ) and 17 nM acetic acid ( 3 ml ) prior to seeding . For autaptic cultures used in electrophysiology experiments , this solution was applied on 15 - mm glass coverslips placed in the wells of 6 - well plates using a custom stamp to create islands of permissive substrate for astrocytes . The astrocytes serve as the feeder layer for hippocampal neurons . The mitosis of astrocytes was then stopped by adding 20 m l ﬂuoro - deoxyuridine ( 80 m M ) following one week of incubation in the 37 (cid:1) C incubator ( 5 % CO 2 ) . The culture media was replaced with Neurobasal A containing 1 % glutamax , 2 % B27 , and 0 . 2 % penicillin - streptomycin . To dissociate hippo - campal neurons , cortices and hippocampi were dissected from either P0 mice ( synaptojanin ) or E18 embryonic mice ( endophilin ) with the appropriate genotype . Cortices were lysed ( 10 mM Tris - HCL pH8 . 0 and 100 mM NaCl in presence of 50 m g proteinase K ) to extract DNA for the genotype veriﬁcation by PCR . To dissociate neurons , hippocampi were incubated at 37 (cid:1) C for 0 . 5 - 1 hr in enzyme solution ( 1 . 65 mM Cysteine , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA in DMEM ) containing 20 units of Papain . The dissociated neurons were seeded on the astrocyte feeder layer in the 12 - well plates at 6 . 5x10 4 ( electron microscopy ) , 5x10 4 ( pHluorin imaging ) , or 3x10 3 ( electrophysiology ) per well and incubated at 37 (cid:1) C for 2 weeks . All the experiments were performed 13 - 18 days in vitro ( DIV13 - 18 ) . To reduce the number of clathrin - coated vesicles in the resting terminal , neurons were routinely incubated with 100 nM tetrodotoxin overnight prior to the experiments and washed 5 min before the sample loading . However , this treatment was not particularly helpful , since there was no signiﬁcant difference in coated vesicle accumulation when this step was omitted . For biochemistry , 10x10 3 cells / cm 2 were cultured without the feeder layer in 6 - well plates . Expression constructs Lentiviral expression constructs were used to express transgenes in neurons . All vectors were based on the lentiviral shuttlevector FUGW ( Lois et al . , 2002 ) . For ﬂash - and - freeze , a variant of channelrhodopsin ChetaTC - YFP ( Berndt et al . , 2011 ; Gunaydin et al . , 2010 ) was cloned into this vector ; the expression was controlled by the human synapsin 1 promoter ( f ( syn ) - ChetaTC - YFP - w ) ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) . The cDNA of the 145kDa isoform ( 1309 aa ) of Synaptojanin 1 was ampliﬁed from the cDNA library of mouse brain and cloned in frame downstream of a synapsin - 1 promoter with NLS - GFP - P2A ( NGP ) sequence . The GFP signals allowed us to evaluate viral infection and intensity of transgene expression from this polycistronic construct ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . The mutant versions of synaptojanin ( SYNJ1 C383S and SYNJ1 D730A ) were generated from the synaptojanin wild - type cDNA using the Quikchange II Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent ) . Sequence veriﬁed mutant cDNA was subsequently cloned in the lentiviral vector with synapsin - 1 promoter and NGP expression cassette ( f ( syn ) - NGP - Synj1 - C383S - w , f ( syn ) - NGP - Synj1 - D730A ) . For the control , GFP was expressed in the nucleus ( f ( syn ) - NLS - GFP - P2A - w ) . For endophilin - 1 , mouse EndoA1 cDNA ( NCBI genebank U58886 . 1 ) was cloned into a lentiviral vector . Additional ubiquitin promoter was added to the expression of RFP to visualize infected neurons ( f ( syn ) urw - en - dophilin1 ) ( Weston et al . , 2011 ) . For the expression of Cre recombinase , the C terminus of a codon - improved Cre ( iCre ) was fused to RFP . The construct is then cloned into lentiviral vectors with synapsin - 1 promoter controlled expression cassette ( f ( syn ) - iCre - RFP - w ) ( Vardar et al . , 2016 ) . For the control , RFP was expressed in nucleus ( f ( syn ) - NLS - RFP - w ) . For pHluorin imaging a SypHluorin - 2x ( Zhu et al . , 2009 ) cDNA was cloned into lentiviral vector with the human synapsin - I promoter ( f ( syn ) - Syp2pHluorin - w ) ( Herman et al . , 2014 ) . pcDNA3 - SypHluorin 2x ( S2x ) was a gift from Stephen Heinemann & Yongling Zhu ( Addgene plasmid # 37004 ) ) . Lentivirus production and infection Lentiviruses carrying the expression constructs were produced by the Charite´ viral core facility ( v cf . charite . de ) using the following procedures . The bottom surface of T - 75 ﬂasks were coated with poly - L - lysin ( 2 % in milliQ water ) . A day before the transfection , HEK293T cells were plated at 6 . 5x10 5 / ml ( 10 mL in T - 75 ) in Neurobasal A ( NBA ) media containing 1 % glutamax , 2 % B27 , and 0 . 2 % penicillin - streptomycin . The shuttle vector ( FUGW ) ( Lois et al . , 2002 ) containing expression constructs and helper plasmids ( VSV - G and CMV - dR8 . 9 ) ( Stewart et al . , 2003 ) were mixed at 20 , 5 , and 7 . 5 m g , respectively , in 640 m l NaCl solution ( 150 mM ) ( Solution I ) . Another solution ( solution II ) was prepared as follows : 246 . 7 m l H 2 O , 320 m l NaCl ( 300 mM ) , 73 . 3 m l polyethylenimine ( 0 . 6 m g / m l ) . Solution I and II were mixed , vortexed , and incubated at at room temperature for 10 minutes followed by addition to the T - 75 ﬂask containing HEK293T cells . The cells were incubated at 32 (cid:1) C ( 5 % CO 2 ) , and the viruses were harvested 3 days later . e3 Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 . e1 – e6 , June 27 , 2018 The media containing lentiviruses were centrifuged at 4000 rpm to obtain 20 - fold concentration using Amicon tube ( Ultra - 15 , Ultracel - 100k ) . After the centrifugation , the column was topped off with NBA media , resulting in the titer of about 10 7 . The infection efﬁciency is determined by sample infection in wild - type neurons that were not used in the study . For all the experiments , dissociated hippocampal neurons were infected on DIV1 - 3 with lentiviruses carrying the expression constructs . The infection rate of 100 % was achieved in all cases . Western blots and immunocytochemical staining For detection of expression levels by western blots , protein lysates were obtained from astrocyte - free mass cultures of hippocampal neurons . Brieﬂy , cells were lysed using 50 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 7 . 9 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , and protease inhibitors ( cOMPLETE protease inhibitor cocktail tablet , Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) . Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay . Proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocel - lulose membranes . Membranes were then incubated with rabbit anti - synaptojanin - 1 ( 1 : 300 Gesualdo , gift of de Camilli Lab ) and mouse anti - tubulin III ( 1 : 2000 , Sigma - Aldrich , T8660 ) antibodies overnight at 4 (cid:1) C . After incubation with corresponding horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat secondary antibodies ( 1h at room temperature ) and ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents ( GE Healthcare Biosciences ) , chemiluminescent was imaged using a Vilber Lourmat Fusion FX7 detection system . Ratiometric quantiﬁ - cation of signal intensities was measured with the supplied BIO - 1D software package of the Fusion FX system . Flash - and - freeze experiments Sapphire disks with cultured cells were mounted in the freezing chamber of the high - pressure freezer ( HPM100 or EM ICE , Leica ) , which was set at 37 (cid:1) C . The extracellular solution contained 140 mM NaCl , 2 . 4 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM Glucose ( pH adjusted to 7 . 3 with NaOH , 300 mOsm ) , 4 mM CaCl 2 , and 1 mM MgCl 2 . Additionally , NBQX ( 3 m M ) and Bicuculline ( 30 m M ) were added to suppress recurrent network activity following optogenetic stimulation of neurons . To minimize the exposure to room temperature , solutions were kept at 37 (cid:1) C water bath prior to use . The table attached to the high - pressure freezer was heated to (cid:3) 37 (cid:1) C while mounting specimens on the high - pressure freezer . The transparent polycarbonate sample cartridges were also warmed to 37 (cid:1) C . Immediately after the sapphire disk was mounted on the sample holder , recording solution kept at 37 (cid:1) C was applied to the specimen and the cartridge was inserted into the freezing chamber . The specimens were left in the chamber for 30 s to recover from the exposure to ambient light . Using a custom - built light stimulation controller , we applied 1 light pulse ( 10 ms ) to the specimens ( 20 mW / mm 2 ) . This stimulation protocol was chosen based on the results from previous experiments showing approximately 90 % of cells ﬁre at least one action potential ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) . The non - stimulation controls for each experiment were always frozen on the same day from the same animal . We set the device so that the samples were frozen at 30 , 100 , 300 , 1000 , 3000 , 10 , 000 , or 30 , 000 ms after the initiation of the ﬁrst stimulus . For ferritin - loading experiments , cationized ferritin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added in the recording solution at 0 . 25 mg / ml . The calcium concentration was reduced to 1 mM to suppress spontaneous activity during the loading . The cells were incubated in the solution for 5 min at 37 (cid:1) C . After ferritin incubation , the cells were immersed in the external solution containing 4 mM Ca 2 + . The change in calcium concentrations from 1 mM to 4 mM increases the rate of miniature EPSCs and thus may contribute to the background ferritin loading before the experiments . In our experiments , about 1 % of synaptic proﬁles contained endosomes and synaptic vesicles that were ferritin - positive without stimulation . The absence of ferritin - positive coated pits on the plasma membrane in the unstimulated controls suggests that ferritin passes through endosomes even during spontaneous activity . Due to space limitation in our automated freeze - substitution unit ( AFS2 ) , we omitted earlier time points ( 100 ms and 300 ms ) in ferritin - loading experiments so that all specimens from one group of experiments could be prepared in parallel on the same day . Successful completion of ultrafast endocytosis was evaluated by the presence of ferritin particles in large endocytic vesicles or synaptic endosomes at the 1 s time point . Freeze - substitution and plastic embedding Following high - pressure freezing , samples were transferred into a vial containing 1 % osmium tetroxide ( EMS ) , 1 % glutaraldehyde ( EMS ) , 1 % milliQ water , in anhydrous acetone ( EMS ) . The specimens were kept under liquid nitrogen at all times during this process . The freeze - substitution was performed in AFS2 ( Leica ) with the following program : (cid:4) 90 (cid:1) C for 5 - 7 hours , 5 (cid:1) C / hour to (cid:4) 20 (cid:1) C , 12 hours at (cid:4) 20 (cid:1) C , and 10 (cid:1) C / hour to 20 (cid:1) C . Following en bloc staining with 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone , the samples were inﬁltrated and embedded into epon and cured for 48 hours in a 60 (cid:1) C oven . Ultramicrotomy and electron microscopy Serial 40 - nm sections were cut using a microtome ( Leica UCT and UC7 ) and collected onto pioloform - coated ( 0 . 7 % ) single - slot grids . Sections were stained with 2 . 5 % uranyl acetate prior to imaging . For ferritin experiments , sections were not stained after sectioning to improve contrast of ferritin molecules in our images – this , in turn , might have compromised our ability to distinguish clathrin - coated vesicles . Approximately 100 - 150 synaptic proﬁles were collected from a single section from each specimen , and the exper - iments were repeated with second cultures in each case ( for detailed n values , see Quantiﬁcation and Statistical Analysis section ) . Prior to sectioning , all the samples were blinded to genotypes and treatments to avoid potential bias during imaging . The sample size was chosen based on the previous experiments that allowed us to acquire a sufﬁciently large set of data for statistical analysis ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) . Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 . e1 – e6 , June 27 , 2018 e4 pHluorin imaging Experiments using synaptophysin - pHluorin imaging were performed on primary continental cultures of hippocampal neurons from littermates . Cultures were infected 24 - 48 hours after plating and were imaged between DIV13 and 18 . Extracellular ﬁeld stimulation was performed using a perfusion chamber with ﬁeld stimulation ( Warner Instruments ) . Stimulation protocols were 10 stimuli at 20 Hz or 75 stimuli at 10 Hz for synaptojanin experiments and 10 or 40 stimuli at 20 Hz for endophilin experiments , with each pulse lasting 1 ms . The stimulation chamber was set to deliver 50 mA current for each action potential , the lowest current to achieve stable response to 75 APs ( 10 Hz ) in control cells infected with pHluorin . Before each train of action potentials , baseline images were obtained for 5 s in the absence of stimulation . Images were acquired at a rate of 1 Hz using the Hamamatsu CCD camera with binning of 2 , depth of 16 bit , and images 256 3 256 pixels and the CoolLED system with wavelength 470 nm at 60x magniﬁcation ( NA = 1 . 2 ) . During imaging experiments , neurons were bathed in extracellular solution containing : 2 mM Ca 2 + and 4 mM Mg 2 + , 15 m M bicuculline , 5 m M NBQX , 10 m M AP5 . Solutions were delivered through a custom heated ﬂow - pipe ( Pyott and Rosenmund , 2002 ) , adjusted for a set point of 35 (cid:1) C , with a range of 34 - 37 (cid:1) C . Temperatures were also veriﬁed by intermittent checks with a temperature probe . Each coverslip was broken with a diamond pencil , and from the pieces generated , ﬁelds of view were selected randomly by eye to image . The selection of puncta that were used to analyze pHluorin kinetics is described below . Electrophysiology Whole cell patch - clamp recordings in autaptic hippocampal neurons were performed as previously described ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) . Brieﬂy , extracellular solution contained 140 mM NaCl , 2 . 4 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM glucose , 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 4 mM MgCl 2 ( pH adjusted to 7 . 4 , and osmolarity adjusted to 300 mOsm ) . Intracellular solution contained : 136 mM KCl , 17 . 8 mM HEPES , 1 mM EGTA , 4 . 6 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM Na 2 ATP , 0 . 3 mM Na 2 GTP , 12 mM creatine phosphate , 50 units / ml creatine - phosphoki - nase ( pH adjusted to 7 . 4 ) . Solutions were heated to 35 (cid:1) C and applied using the custom - built fast - ﬂow system described above . Borosilicate glass pipettes ( Science Products ) were used with a resistance of 2 - 5 MOhm and ﬁlled with intracellular solution . Series resistance was compensated 70 % , and neurons were stimulated by a 1 - ms somatic depolarization to 0 mV from a holding potential of (cid:4) 70 mV . Data were recorded using a Multiclamp 700B ampliﬁer ( Molecular Devices ) and pClamp 10 software ( Molecular Devices ) , digitized at 10 kHz , low - pass Bessel ﬁltered at 3 kHz , and analyzed with AxoGraph X 1 . 5 . 4 ( AxoGraph ) . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The experiments were performed in at least two independent cultures unless otherwise noted . Data are pooled and all are included unless otherwise noted . Detailed statistics can be found in Table S1 . Electron microscopy The total number of synaptic proﬁles analyzed for these experiments was 10 , 208 . The synaptic proﬁles were chosen randomly to sample unbiased populations . Active zones were deﬁned as regions juxtaposed to a post - synaptic density . Docked vesicles are deﬁned as those directly in contact with membrane . Morphometry of pits include ‘width’ , which is the opening at the base , ‘depth’ , which is the height from base to top , and diameter , which is measured as the width at half of the depth . The large endocytic vesicles are deﬁned as vesicles larger than (cid:3) 50 nm by visual inspection and within 50 nm of active zone , measured in ImageJ . Endosomes are deﬁned as membrane - bound organelles that are in the center of the bouton and larger than 100 nm by visual inspection . Vesicular compartments with coated buds were also categorized as endosomes , which appeared frequently in our 3 s time points . Vesicles are scored as clathrin - coated only if distinctive coats were visible which can lead to underscoring . Furthermore , the chance of capturing a coated vesicle in a given synaptic proﬁle is low compared to an endosome due to its size . These factors will lead to an underes - timation of the number of coated vesicles observed in proﬁles . The morphometry was performed blind using custom - written ImageJ macro and MATLAB scripts ( S . W . and E . M . J . , unpublished data ; available upon request ) . We used Mann - Whitney U tests or Kruskall - Wallis nonparametric ANOVA for numbers collected in electron microscopy due to the skewed distribution of the data . The skewness was determined using Pearson’s skewness test . The conﬁdence level was set at 0 . 05 in each case . When appropriate , we applied the Bonferroni correction to reduce the chance of obtaining false positive in multiple comparisons on a single dataset . The gray shade in the P value columns suggest the difference observed is statistically signiﬁcant . The experiments were repeated from at least two independent cultures . All data are pooled and plotted . All collected data were included in the analysis . Numbers are available in the Table S1 . pHluorin imaging pHluorin images were analyzed in ImageJ , all images for a given ﬁeld of view were concatenated , background subtracted using ‘‘Rolling Ball’’ background subtraction with radius 50 and corrected for movement using the StackReg plugin ( The´venaz et al . , 1998 ) . To identify synapses , circular regions of 2 m m 2 ( ROIs ) were manually selected from the D F between the average baseline ( 3 images immediately prior to stimulation ) and the peak ﬂuorescence following a strong stimulus ( 300AP at 10 Hz for synaptojanin and 300 AP at 20 Hz for endophilin ) . By selecting from the peak of an unrelated stack , synapses were chosen on the basis of their response to activity and irrespective of decay kinetics . This set of ROIs was then applied as a mask to the background - subtracted stack , and intensity was measured for each ROI . The trains of interest for each ﬁeld of view ( 10 AP , 20 Hz and 75 AP , 10 Hz for e5 Neuron 98 , 1184 – 1197 . e1 – e6 , June 27 , 2018 synaptojanin , 40 AP , 20 Hz for endophilin ) , were then obtained by averaging all ROIs . To compare groups , the raw average intensities for each ﬁeld of view were baselined to the 3 images immediately preceding the stimulus and normalized to the peak ﬂuorescence following the stimulus . Time constants were obtained by ﬁtting a single exponential in AxoGraph to the decay of each normalized ﬁeld of view . Percentage of ﬂuorescence recovered at 3 s and 30 s was analyzed using the ﬁeld of view averages at each time - point after the peak for each ﬁeld of view . Fields of view are taken from either 1 ( Synj + / + ; Synj1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) ; Synj1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , SYNJ1 ( 145kD ) ; Synj1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , SYNJ1 D730A ; Synj1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) , SYNJ1 C383S ; EndoA2 KO , EndoA1 KO rescue ) or 2 cultures ( EndoA TKO , EndoA DKO , EndoA1 KO ) . We used Kruskall - Wallis nonparametric ANOVA for dataset collected from pHluorin imaging . Dunn‘s post - test was performed to compare all pairs of columns . Stacks free of motion or focus drift were included in the analysis with the following exclusion criteria : ﬁelds of view in which the ﬂuorescence increase and decay pattern was not time - locked to the stimulus , or which did not exhibit exponential decay were excluded from analysis .
