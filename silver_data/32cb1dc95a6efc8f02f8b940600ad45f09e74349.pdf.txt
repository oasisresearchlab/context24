Detergent - insoluble Glycolipid Microdomains in Lymphocytes in the Absence of Caveolae” ( Received for publication , July 25 , 1994 , and in revised form , October 7 , 1994 ) Anna M . Fra , Edward Williamson , Kai Simons , and Robert G . Parton * From the European Molecular Biology Laboratory , 69012 Heidelberg , Federal Republic of Germany Antibody binding to glycolipids and glycophosphati - dylinositol ( GP1 ) - anchored proteins of lymphocytes can trigger activation of specific signal transduction path - ways . The finding that GPI - anchored proteins are pres - ent in detergent - insoluble complexes with several tyro - sine kinases of the Src family suggested that these complexes may represent membrane microdomains in - volved in the transduction of signals to the cell interior . Recent work has suggested a link between detergent - insoluble microdomains and plasma membrane in - vaginations termed caveolae . Here we show that lym - phocytes lack plasma membrane domains with the char - acteristic features of caveolae . Furthermore , VIP21 - caveolin was not detectable in four different lymphocyte cell lines at the protein or mRNAlevel . In addition to the lack of caveolar domains , capping experiments sug - gested that the bulk of the GPI - anchored protein Thyl and the glycosphingolipid GMl were not stably associ - ated in the lymphocyte plasma membrane . Despite this , Thyl and GMI were present in detergent - insoluble com - plexes . We conclude that detergent insolubility does not correlate with the presence of caveolae or of VIP21 - caveolin and that caveolae , as defined by a number of different markers , are not involved in signal transduc - tion in lymphocytes . Cross - linking of glycophosphatidylinositol ( GP1 ) ’ - anchored surface glycoproteins can trigger the activation of specific sig - nal transduction pathways in lymphocytes ( for review see Ref . 1 ) . As GPI - anchored proteins are anchored in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer , the mechanism by which such signals are transmitted across the bilayer to the cytoplasmic surface is not clear . The finding that GPI - anchored proteins are present in insoluble complexes with tyrosine kinases of the Src family ( 2 - 5 ) suggested the existence of membrane microdomains that Mobility Programme ( to A .

Based on characterization of detergent - insoluble com - plexes , these microdomains would consist of GPI - anchored pro - teins associated with specific glycolipids in large structures of about 100 nm in diameter ( 2 , 3 , 6 ) . The association of GPI - anchored proteins with these domains is dependent on the GPI anchor ; transmembrane forms of the same proteins do not as - sociate with Src kinases and cannot transduce signals across the membrane ( 5 ) . In addition , association of the Src kinases , ~ 5 6 ‘ ‘ ~ and p59”” , with GPI - anchored proteins was shown to require palmitoylation of their amino termini ( 7 , 8 ) . Glycolipid - based microdomains may represent a general phenomenon for segregation of membrane constituents within the plane of a membrane . In epithelial cells detergent - insoluble membrane domains were shown to be enriched in newly syn - thesized GPI - anchored proteins , glycosphingolipids ( GSLs ) , and cholesterol ( 9 , 10 ) . As GPI - anchored proteins and viral proteins destined for the apical surface acquire detergent in - solubility in a late Golgi compartment the results are consist - ent with the hypothesis that apically destined proteins are segregated into GSL - enriched microdomains in the trans - Golgi network of epithelial cells before transport to the cell surface ( 11 ) . Detergent insolubility has proven a powerful tool to enrich for components of membrane microdomains ( 12 , 13 ) . The first component of these detergent - insoluble complexes to be iso - lated was VIP21 - caveolin ( 12 ) . VIP21 - caveolin was subse - quently shown to be present in the trans - Golgi network , exo - cytic vesicles , and in the plasma membrane invaginations termed caveolae ( 14 ) . Caveolae are enriched in certain GSLs ( 15 ) and in GPI - anchored proteins ( 16 ) and therefore show some of the characteristics of glycolipid microdomains . Subse - quently , detergent - insoluble material isolated from MDCK cells was shown to contain a Src - like kinase and tyrosine kinase substrates ( 13 ) . It was therefore suggested that caveolae , and in particular VIP21 - caveolin , are involved in signal transduc - tion . In this paper we investigated the possible role of caveolae in lymphocytes in which the signal transduction machinery and pathways are well characterized . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines and Antibodies”A20 ( IgGk BALB / c mouse B lymphoma ( 17 ) ) , HeLa , and NIH - 3T3 cell were cultured in DMEM , 10 % fetal calf serum ; A20 medium was supplemented with 50 p ~ 2 - mercaptoethanol . P3X63 - Ag8 . 653 ( Ag8 ) ( Ig - mouse myeloma ) , Jurkat ( human T lym - phoma ) , and 2B2318 ( mouse T hybridoma ( 18 ) ) were maintained in RPMI , 10 % fetal calf serum . MDCK strain I1 and A431 cells were cultured as described previously ( 14 ) . The monoclonal anti - caveolin antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY ) . The affinity - purified rabbit anti - VIP21 NH , - terminal peptide ( amino acids 14 - 33 ) has been characterized previously ( 14 ) . The rabbit anti - Thy1 serum and the rabbit anti - mouse integrin pl serum were kindly provided by Claude Bron ( Institute of Biochemistry , University of Lausanne , Switzerland ) and by Paolo Bernardi ( Department of Bio - medical sciences , University of Padova , Italy ) , respectively . Western Blot - Western blot analysis was performed as previously described ( 14 ) . Thyl and VIP2l - caveolin were analyzed by 15 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels ( 19 ) under reducing conditions , while nonreducing 8 % gels were used for integrin pl . Northern Blot - Total RNA was prepared using the single - step acid guanidinium thiocyanate / phenol / chloroform extraction ( 20 ) . RNA samples ( 10 pg ) were separated on a 1 % agarose , 6 % formaldehyde gel and transferred in 10 x SSC to a Hybond - N membrane ( Amersham Corp . ) . The membrane was prehybridized for 2 h at 42 “C in 5 x SSC , 50 % formamide , 5 x Denhardt’s solution , 1 % SDS ( 21 ) and then incu - bated overnight with the 32P - labeled probes dissolved in the same so - 30745 30746 Lymphocyte Glycolipid Microdomains lution . After hybridization the membrane was washed with 0 . 1 x SSC , 1 % SDS and exposed to x - ray films . Probes were prepared by random priming ( Amersham Corp . ) from MDCK VIP21 cDNA ( 12 ) and from a 283 - base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment derived from human g1 . yceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA . Detergent Extractions - The detergent extraction and flotation proto - cols were adapted from previously described procedures ( 9 , 10 ) . 2 x 10 ' 2B2318 cells , preincubated for 30 min with 5 pg / ml CT - HRP in DMEM , 10 mx + Hepes , 0 . 2 % BSA were washed once in PBS and extracted for 30 min on ice with 500 1 . 11 of TNEmiton X - 100 ( 25 mhl Tris - CI , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCI , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and a mixture of protease inhibitors containing 20 pg / ml each of chymostatin , leupeptin , antipain , and pepstatin ) . The extract was brought to 1 . 5 sucrose in a SW 40 centrifuge tube , overlaid with 8 . 5 ml of 1 . 2 N and 2 . 5 ml of0 . 15 M sucrose in 10 mh ! Tris - HCI , pH 7 . 5 , and centrifuged fnr 18 h at 38 , 000 rpm at 4 " C . 1 - ml fractions and the pellet were collected and used for HRP activity determination or Western blot analysis . Electron Microscopy " A431 cells were plated 18 - 24 h before each experiment and were used at 60430 % confluency . CT and CT conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( CT - HRP ) were purchased from Sigma . CT adsorbed to 14 - nm gold ( CT - gold ) was prepared exactly as described previously ( 15 ) . A431 cells were washed in DMEM , 10 mhl Hepes con - taining 0 . 26 BSA and incubated in this medium without serum for 1 h before each experiment . 2B2318 cells were similarly washed by cen - trifugation and resuspension with Hanks ' buffered salt solution ( HBSS ) containing 0 . 1 % RSA before incubating with labeling reagents . The A431 cells or 2B2318 cells were then incubated with CT - HRP ( 10 pg / ml ) or CT - gold in the above media at 8 " C to maximize clustering in caveolae ( 15 ) . Cells were fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 50 mM cacodylate buffer and processed for Epon sections as described previously ( 22 ) . To determine the percentage of plasma membrane occupied by in - vaginations we used cells that were surface labeled with CT - HRP at 8 " C . The invaginations were arbitrarily classified as follows : " ~ 100 nm , " ; . e . including structures of the size of caveolae ; and ' % 100 nm , " invaginations greater than 100 nm in any direction , i . e . excluding typ - ical caveolae - size structures ( see Fig . 3c ) . The fraction of surface occu - pied by profiles with these dimensions was determined by intersection counting ( 23 ) . To determine the percentage of gold particles within the variously sized structures , over 400 gold particles were counted for each condition . In order to detect Thyl , T lymphocytes were incubated in HBSS for 1 h to remove serum , prefixed for 10 min with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 100 mM sodium cacodylate , pH 7 . 4 , washed four times for 5 min each in HBSS , and then labeled . Alternatively , unfixed cells were labeled di - rectly after HBSS incubation . Cells were labeled using the rabbit poly - clonal anti - Thy1 antibody at 8 " C followed by protein A gold . Both pre - fixed and unfixed cells were then processed for Epon embedding as described above . Capping and Immunofluorescence Microscopy - For G , , , capping ex - periments , 1 x lo6 2B2318 cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with 100 pl ofa 10 pg / ml solution of CT in PBS , 0 . 1 % BSA . Cells were washed and incubated on ice for a further 30 min with a 1 : 300 dilution of rabbit anti - CT antibodies ( Sigma ) . After resuspension in a 1 : 300 dilution of rhodamine - conjugated AfliniPure donkey anti - rabbit IgG antibodies ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) , capping was induced by incubating cells at 37 " C for 25 min . Cells were then washed with PBS ( - ) , plated on multiwell slides pretreated with 0 . 05 % poly - n - lysine ( Sigma ) , and fixed for 7 min in PBS ( - ) , 3 % paraformaldeyde at room temperature ; alde - hyde groups were then quenched for 5 min in 50 mM NH , Cl . After blocking with PBS , 0 . 1 % BSA , Thyl was detected by treating cells with a 1 : 30 dilution of rat monoclonal anti - Thy1 ( Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated goat anti - rat antibodies ( Cappel , Durham , NC ) preadsorbed with rabbit IgG coupled to Sepharose . Slides were mounted in Mowiol and analyzed by confocal microscopy . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To investigate the relationship between glycolipid - rich com - plexes and caveolae in lymphocytes , we first examined whether these cells expressed the caveolar marker VIP2l - caveolin . Four lymphoid cell lines were chosen for this analysis : the B lym - phoma A20 , the myeloma Ag8 , and the T cells Jurkat and 2B2318 . By Western blot , no VIP21 - caveolin was detectable in the lymphocyte lysates using the anti - caveolin monoclonal an - tibody , whereas the characteristic VIP21 - caveolin doublet ( 20 - 21 kDa ) was visible in the control cells MDCKII , NIH - 3T3 , a anti - eavealin auti VlP21 - N b VlP21 - enveolin FIG . 1 . Lack of W21 - caveolin expression in lymphocytes . Ex - pression of VIP21 - caveolin in four lymphoid cell lines ( Jurkat , 2B2318 , A20 , and Ag8 ) was examined by Western ( a ) and Northern blot ( b ) in comparison with control cell lines ( HeLa , NIH - 3T3 , and MDCKII ) . a , total cell lysates containing comparable amounts of protein were ana - lyzed by using either the monoclonal anti - caveolin antibody ( left panel ) or the affinity - purified rabbit anti - VIP21 - N antiserum , which only rec - ognizes the 21 - kDa form of the protein ( right panel ) . VIP2l - caveolin ( indicated by arrows ) is not detectable in lymphocytes ; an immuno - globulin light chain reacting with the secondary antibody is visible as a specific band in the A20 lane . b , 10 pg of total RNA extracted from the indicated cell lines was hybridized with : ' 2P - labeled probes derived from either VIP2l - caveolin cDNA ( upper panels ) or human glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase ( lower panel ) . Alonger exposure of the North - ern blot is shown for the human cell lines ( HeLa " and Jurkat " ) . and HeLa ( Fig . la , left panel ) . Similarly , no VIP21 - caveolin was detected in 2B2318 cells using the affinity - purified rabbit anti - VIP21 - N antibody ( 14 ) ( Fig . la , right panel ) . The absence of caveolin in lymphocytes was confirmed by Northern blot anal - ysis ( Fig . lb ) . In all lymphoid cell lines tested , the VIP21 - caveolin band was not visible even with longer exposures or if lower stringency washes were used . In the absence of caveolin , we investigated whether glyco - sphingolipids were detergent - insoluble in 2B2318 cells . In fi - broblasts a large proportion of G , , was shown to be detergent - insoluble under conditions where the bulk of membrane proteins and other lipids were solubilized ( 24 ) . Using a similar procedure , 2B2318 lymphocytes and A431 cells , an epidermoid cell line with numerous caveolae ( 151 , were incubated with CT - HRP or transferrin - HRP and extracted with a buffer con - taining 1 % Triton X - 100 , and detergent - insoluble complexes were separated from soluble material by centrifugation . With both cell lines approximately 99 % of surface - bound transferrin - HRP was released into the supernatant , whereas a large frac - tion of surface - bound CT - HRP was detergent - insoluble ( 74 % insoluble in 2B2318 cells , 46 % in A431 cells ) . To further characterize the glycolipid - rich detergent - insolu - ble complexes separated from high density insoluble material , we prepared them by flotation on a sucrose step gradient as described previously ( 9 , lO ) . 2B2318 cells were incubated before detergent treatment with CT - HRP to allow detection of G , , ; the GPI - anchored protein Thyl and the transmembrane protein integrin p l were analyzed by Western blot ( Fig . 2 ) . Using this procedure , it was possible to estimate the percentage of each component recovered in the detergent - insoluble complexes un - der these conditions . As summarized in the graph , a large frac - tion of Thyl and of the CT - HRP - labeled GM , was found at the top of the gradient while all integrin pl remained in the bottom fractions . A similar distribution of G , , and Thyl was observed Lymphocyte Glycolipid Microdomains . 30747 1 W GMI ( cT .

Detergent - insoluble glycolipid complexes , pre - pared by Triton X - 100 extraction of 2B2318 cells pretreated with CT - HRP , were separated from soluble and high density material by flota - tion on a sucrose step gradient . Fractions of the gradient ( numbered from the top ) were analyzed for G , , , Thyl , and integrin Pl content . Western blot analysis of 61 and Thyl distribution is shown in the panels sented in the graph together with the CT - HRP activity reflecting G , , at the hottom ; the corresponding densitometric quantitation is repre - distribution . A significant fraction of G , , , and Thyl peaks at the 1 . 2 hd0 . 15 M sucrose interface in contrast to integrin 61 . without CT treatment ( data not shown ) . Therefore , G , , and Thyl are present in low density detergent - insoluble complexes in the lymphocytes tested despite the absence of caveolin . We then investigated whether lymphocytes have surface in - vaginations with the morphology of caveolae . We used CT , which binds to the ganglioside G , , , as a putative marker for caveolae ( 15 ) . Due to the expression of G , , , the T hybridoma 2B2318 was selected for this analysis . Cells were incubated with either CT - HRP or CT - gold . After surface labeling with CT - HRP at 8 " C a uniform labeling of the entire plasma mem - brane was apparent ( Fig . 3a ) . Although low labeling was ob - served in some invaginations of the surface , these invagina - tions were very heterogeneous in size and shape . In contrast to A431 cells , in which invaginations with the characteristic size and shape of caveolae were labeled ( inset ) , very few invagina - tions with the morphology of caveolae were evident in 2B2318 cells . This was examined in a quantitative fashion using CT - gold . CT - gold was distributed fairly evenly over the lymphocyte surface ( results not shown ) . Approximately 0 . 6 % of the gold was found in invaginations smaller than 100 nm ( Table I ) . These invaginations occupied 0 . 2 % of the plasma membrane , showing that there is not a great enrichment in these structures . Recent studies showed that antibody labeling of a GPI - an - chored protein prior to fixation causes its clustering in caveolae ( 25 ) . We therefore investigated the distribution of Thyl with and without a pre - fixation step . After a brief fixation with glutaraldehyde , Thyl labeling was evenly distributed over the cell surface ( Fig . 3b ) . 0 . 65 % of the gold label was present in invaginations of diameter less than 100 nm . When cells were labeled at 8 " C prior to fixation , gold particles were found clus - tered within invaginations of various sizes ( Fig . 3 , c and d ) . Under these conditions 13 % of the gold was present within structures larger than 100 nm , but only 5 . 8 % was found within smaller structures ( Table I ) . This was not the result of trapping molecules during labeling or inadequate washing , as protein A gold in the absence of antibody was not observed in these struc - I Flc ; . 3 .

The percentage of the gold particles within structures of the sizes indi - cated was determined . The fraction of the plasma membrane occupied by invaginations < lo0 nm was approximately 0 . 18 % . and for structures 2100 nm was 0 . 23 % .

In conclusion , our results show that invaginations with the characteristic morphology of caveolae are extremely rare in 2B2318 lymphocytes . The few small invaginations observed were not highly labeled by caveolar markers . To further investigate the possible association of G , , and Thyl , we performed capping experiments in which immun - ofluorescence was used to study the distribution of one of the two antigens on the cell surface after capping of the second one . In contrast to their extensive association in detergent - insoluble complexes , no significant redistribution of Thyl was induced upon G , , capping ( Fig . 4 ) . Similarly G , , appeared evenly dis - tributed after capping of Thyl , consistent with preliminary electron microscopy observations ( results not shown ) .

The two antigens do not show significant colocalization under these conditions . results suggest that there is little association of G , , and Thyl in the living cell , despite the bulk of these components associ - ating with detergent - insoluble complexes . Our results show that VIP21 - caveolin is not expressed in lymphocytes and that lymphocytes lack , or have exceedingly low numbers of , caveolae . In this study we defined caveolae by the presence of GPI - anchored proteins and GSLs after surface labeling , the presence of VIP21 - caveolin , and by morphology at the ultrastructural level . While detergent insolubility has been used to enrich for caveolar components our results show that detergent insolubility does not correlate with caveolar localiza - tion . Consistent with a number of other studies , a large fraction of the GPI - anchored protein Thyl and of the ganglioside G , , was detergent - insoluble in lymphocytes . In A431 cells caveolae were shown to occupy 7 % of the plasma membrane , and ap - proximately 50 % of a cholera toxin conjugate was present in caveolae after labeling the cell surface ( 15 ) . Nevertheless , the fraction of insoluble Ghri after cholera toxin surface labeling was similar in lymphocytes and in A431 cells . Similarly , under conditions in which we labeled Thyl in caveolae of NIH - 3T3 cells ( results not shown ) we found little concentration of Thyl in caveolae - like invaginations of lymphocytes although patches of labeling were found in heterogeneously sized invaginations . The lack of a correlation between caveolar localization and detergent insolubility is also consistent with our previous stud - ies showing that VIP - 36 is not concentrated in caveolae under steady state conditions and yet is largely detergent - insoluble ( 26 ) . Interestingly , VIP - 36 was shown to be concentrated in caveolae after antibody cross - linking at the cell surface . Simi - larly , recent studies suggested that GPI - anchored proteins are only clustered in caveolae after antibody addition ( 25 ) , and yet in the absence of antibody - induced clustering they are present in detergent - insoluble complexes in epithelial cells ( 13 ) . Taken together , these observations show that detergent insolubility cannot correlate with caveolar localization . However , the fact that all these components specifically enter caveolae on anti - body - induced cross - linking and under steady state conditions are detergent - insoluble suggests some link between these proc - esses . The fact that both G , , and Thyl were found in low density fractions after sucrose density centrifugation suggests that both are associated with glycolipid microdomains . How - ever , co - capping experiments suggested that the bulk of G , , and Thyl were not associated in interconnected structures in living cells . Alternatively , the interaction may have too low stability in the absence of detergents for efficient co - capping . We therefore envisage that detergent treatment might result in the formation of larger insoluble aggregates which , although reflecting the presence of glycolipid - rich domains in vivo , would not correlate exactly with the organization of these domains in the living cell . The lack of association of G , , and Thyl in lymphocytes might be related to the lack of VIP21 - caveolin expression ; interestingly , the absence of VIP21 - caveolin in the thyroid epithelial cell line FRT has been suggested to be re - sponsible for the impaired interaction of glycosphingolipids and a GPI - anchored protein during their transport to the cell sur - face ( 27 ) . Finally our results suggest that caveolae , as defined by sev - eral criteria , are not involved in the well characterized signal transduction pathways in lymphocytes . Several different T and B lymphocyte cell lines , including Jurkat , were shown to be activated by cross - linking of endogenous or transfected Thyl ( 28 ) . Activation via anti - Thy1 antibodies induces tyrosine phos - phorylation of specific substrates in 2B4 cells , a murine T hy - bridoma closely related to 2B2318 cells ( 4 , 29 ) . The absence of morphologically defined VIP21 - caveolin - positive caveolae in lymphocytes suggests that these structures are not essential for basic cell function and that they are more likely to have a more specialized role . We do not know whether the heteroge - neous invaginations that were labeled with antibody - labeled Thyl could show some functional similarities to caveolae . How - ever , we can conclude that neither VIP21 - caveolin nor the char - acteristic and highly conserved structure of the caveolar do - main is required for such a function in lymphocytes .
