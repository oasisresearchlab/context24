Indeed , some bacterial pathogens , including the gram - negative bacteria Salmonella , Shigella , and Yersinia and the gram - positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes , have the capacity to induce their own uptake into mammalian cells which are normally nonphagocytic . Entry of all of these bacte - ria requires rearrangement of the host cell actin cytoskeleton , since uptake is impaired by inhibitors of actin polymerization such as cytochalasin D . Exploitation of the cytoskeleton by pathogenic bacteria during entry can be divided , although arti - ficially , into two general strategies , according to the type of morphological changes that occur in the host cell . Entry of Yersinia or Listeria has been described as occurring through a “zipper” type event , while entry of Salmonella or Shigella is of - ten referred to as a “trigger” phenotype . However , even pathogens that share a common strategy appear to target dif - ferent host proteins to induce uptake . After internalization , in - vasive bacteria either reside in membrane - bound vacuoles ( Yersinia and Salmonella ) , or rapidly lyse such vacuoles and move within the cytoplasm by a process involving continuous polymerization of host actin at the posterior end of the bacte - rium ( Listeria and Shigella ) . This intracytoplasmic movement is a prerequisite for direct cell to cell spreading . While the ac - tin - based motilities of Listeria and Shigella are similar in many aspects , different bacterial proteins are involved , again sug - gesting that a similar strategy can be accomplished by noniden - tical molecular mechanisms . Internalization of bacterial pathogens by nonphagocytic cells Yersinia species . After ingestion of contaminated food , the two enteropathogenic Yersinia , Y . pseudotuberculosis and Y . enterocolitica translocate across the intestinal barrier , primar - ily via M cells in Peyer’s patches of the epithelium . Bacterial uptake can be reproduced in vitro ; most normally nonphago - cytic cell lines internalize Yersinia in a membrane - bound com - partment in which bacteria survive but do not multiply ( 1 , 2 ) . Internalization of Y . pseudotuberculosis requires expression of a 986 – amino acid outer membrane protein called invasin , the 192 carboxy - terminal amino acids of which are sufficient to bind mammalian cells . Escherichia coli – expressing invasin or latex beads covered with invasin are internalized , demonstrat - ing that invasin is sufficient for entry . Invasin mediates uptake by binding tightly to a subset of b 1 integrins on the surface of host cells . Each integrin is a heterodimer of a and b chains , and several different a chains can associate with the b 1 chain to form complexes capable of interacting with invasin or natu - ral ligands such as the extracellular matrix proteins fibronec - tin , collagen , and laminin . Interestingly , invasin binds to its re - ceptor with an z 100 - fold higher affinity than do the natural ligands , and binding of ligands like fibronectin does not lead to uptake of small particles . Therefore , high - affinity binding is needed for internalization . At the microscopic level , invasin - mediated entry closely resembles Fc g or complement recep - tor – mediated phagocytosis , and is morphologically character - ized by zippering of a closely apposed host membrane around the bacterium . Host F - actin and signal transduction via ty - rosine phosphorylation are needed for entry , but the specific kinases involved are not known . It was originally thought that direct association of integrins with the cytoskeleton might be required for bacterial internalization , since the intracytoplas - mic domain of the b 1 subunit normally interacts with the cy - toskeleton by binding to the actin - binding proteins talin and a - actinin . However , mutations in b 1 that reduce interaction with the cytoskeleton increase bacterial uptake , while muta - tions that impair uptake are in the sequence NPIY ( 3 ) . This se - quence is also found in the LDL receptor , and appears to me - diate clustering of this protein into clathrin - coated pits by binding to the heterotetrameric adaptor protein AP2 . Intrigu - ingly , large lattices of clathrin and AP2 adaptor complexes are formed beneath bacteria in the early stages of internalization , suggesting that integrin - mediated uptake may involve clathrin and share similarities with clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Salmonella and Shigella species . Like enteropathogenic Yer - sinia , Salmonella and Shigella species also initiate infection in the small bowel primarily by entering and transcytosing across M cells . Experiments with infected mice indicate that for Sal - monella a proportion of transcytosed bacteria disseminate to regional lymph nodes , establishing a systemic infection in sus - ceptible hosts that may result in large foci of infection in the liver and spleen . Some bacteria may infect enterocytes ( 1 , 2 ) . In the case of Shigella , bacteria that have traversed M cells are then engulfed by underlying macrophages , where they induce apoptosis . Apoptotic macrophages release IL - 1 b , contributing to a severe inflammatory response . Bacteria released from these dying cells can invade enterocytes through the basolat - eral surface ( 2 , 4 ) . Entry of Salmonella and Shigella into cultured mammalian cells shares a similar morphological phenotype that is strik - ingly different from that of Yersinia species . Upon initial contact with the host cell , these bacteria trigger dramatic rearrange - ments of cellular F - actin , characterized by large membrane Address correspondence to Pascale Cossart , Unité des Interactions Bactéries - Cellules , Institut Pasteur , 28 Rue du Docteur Roux , 75724 Paris , Cedex 15 , France .

This process is evident within 1 min after contact between pathogen and host , and the affected membrane region then rapidly enlarges over the next 3 min . Bacterial - induced ruffling may lead to macropinocytosis and passive entry of other bacteria or particles which are trapped by the highly dynamic membranes . In contrast to the zipper entry by Yersinia , the host membrane is not closely apposed to the bacterium , but instead engulfs the microorganism in a large vacuole formed by fusion of membrane projections . The bacterial factors that mediate entry of Salmonella and Shigella are not significantly secreted during growth in broth , but instead are released upon contact with mammalian cells . This contact - mediated secretion is one of the properties spe - cific to so - called “type III secretion systems” which are found in a growing number of bacterial pathogens . These systems comprise z 20 genes encoding secreted proteins and proteins involved in the secretion machinery . The secreted proteins do not have a classical signal sequence , and appear to be translo - cated across the two bacterial membranes by a protein com - plex located in the bacterial envelope . Secretion occurs in re - sponse to a signal which may be a contact between a key bacterial protein and the mammalian cell , but it can also be in - duced by soluble factors present in serum . This key bacterial protein seems to act as a plug , which when released allows se - cretion and eventually translocation of effector proteins into the mammalian cell . In Salmonella , this secretion system is en - coded by a “pathogenicity island” or cluster of chromosomal genes known as the inv / spa complex . In Shigella , the mxi / spa complex located on the virulence plasmid encodes a homolo - gous secretion system with secreted proteins involved in entry ( IpaA , B , C , and D ) encoded by ipa genes . The Shigella - secreted proteins IpaB and IpaC associate into a soluble com - plex that can be immunopurified on latex beads . These beads are sufficient to cause membrane ruffling and can be internal - ized in HeLa cells . In the case of Salmonella , interestingly , upon contact with mammalian cells , bacteria become rapidly covered with appendages comprised of unidentified proteins , and assembly of these structures apparently requires the inv / spa type III secretion system ( 5 ) . Entry of Salmonella into cells correlates with increases in intracellular Ca 2 1 levels and IP3 production . It seems likely that the bacterium stimulates host phospholipase C inducing IP3 production which in turn mobilizes Ca 2 1 from intracellular stores . Calcium fluxes could affect uptake by controlling activ - ity of various actin - binding proteins such as a - actinin , talin , and ezrin which are recruited to the site of entry . Internalization of Shigella seems to involve tyrosine phos - phorylation of several key host proteins , including cortactin , pp125FAK , and paxillin . Cortactin is an actin - associated pro - tein and a substrate for the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c - Src . Tyrosine phosphorylation of c - Src increases during Shigella in - vasion , and this kinase is recruited to the site of entry . Tran - sient overexpression of c - Src in transfected cells induces mem - brane ruffling and stimulates entry of normally noninvasive Shigella mutants , suggesting that this kinase plays a role in en - try . T - plastin is an actin - bundling protein that appears to have a function in bacterial uptake , possibly by bundling newly formed actin filaments in membrane extensions . Vinculin , an - other actin - binding protein , also colocalizes to the site of entry of Shigella , and this protein can be coimmunoprecipitated with IpaA ( 6 ) . Bacteria that do not express IpaA still recruit vinculin to the site of entry , but are impaired in recruitment of a - actinin , a vinculin - binding protein . These results suggest that IpaA af - fects vinculin activity after the recruitment step . In mammalian cells , agonist / receptor - mediated rearrange - ments of the actin cytoskeleton leading to membrane ruffling , actin stress fiber formation , or filopodia formation are con - trolled by small GTP - binding proteins of the Rho family ( Rac , Rho , and CDC42 ) . Therefore , it was anticipated that invasive bacteria might regulate Rho GTPases to induce cytoskeletal changes needed for uptake . Recently , it was demonstrated that invasion by Salmonella requires CDC42 function , but not Rac or Rho ( 7 ) . In contrast , invasion by Shigella requires Rho ac - tivity , indicating that the similar trigger phenotypes observed with Salmonella and Shigella occur by at least partly different molecular mechanisms ( 4 ) . Interestingly , an a 5 b 1 integrin in Chinese hamster ovary cells has been shown to be a receptor for Shigella , probably by interaction with IpaB , IpaC , and IpaD ( 8 ) . The fact that this integrin is also one of the receptors for the invasin protein of Yersinia raises the possibility that the same host cell receptor may be exploited in different ways to cause remarkably differ - ent mechanisms ( zipper or trigger ) of entry . Listeria . Like Yersinia , Salmonella , and Shigella , L . mono - cytogenes is a food - borne pathogen which can cross the epithe - lial barrier , possibly via M cells and / or enterocytes ( 9 ) . After translocation , bacteria are engulfed by macrophages and dis - seminate to the spleen and liver . In the immunocompromised host , bacterial replication can occur in hepatocytes leading to a systemic infection with further spreading to the brain or the placenta . Thus , in the infected animal and in tissue culture models , L . monocytogenes invades a wide variety of non - phagocytic cells , in addition to being internalized by profes - sional phagocytes . The morphological events associated with entry have been studied mainly in epithelial cells , and uptake resembles the zipper entry of Yersinia , characterized by absence of mem - brane ruffling , and highly local apposition of the plasma mem - brane with the incoming microbe ( 10 ) . Bacteria appear to pro - gressively sink into the mammalian cell surface . Therefore , although actin cytoskeleton rearrangement is necessary for in - ternalization , rearrangement is apparently highly local , and no striking accumulation of F - actin near the site of entry is ob - served . Two bacterial factors allowing entry have been identified . Internalin ( or InlA ) is a surface protein that mediates entry into cultured intestinal epithelial cells . This protein confers in - vasiveness to the noninvasive species Listeria innocua , suggest - ing that , like invasin of Yersinia , this protein is sufficient to promote entry . Internalin contains multiple tandem copies of a 22 – amino acid leucine - rich motif called a leucine - rich repeat ( LRR ) . 1 LRRs are a feature of several proteins ( mostly eu - karyotic ) that generally participate in protein – protein interac - tion . The mammalian receptor for internalin is E - cadherin , a transmembrane cell adhesion protein normally involved in ho - mophilic cell – cell interactions ( 10 ) . Apart from internalin , the only other heterophilic ligand known for E - cadherin is the in - tegrin a E b 7 expressed in intraepithelial lymphocytes . The in - 1 . Abbreviations used in this paper : LRR , leucine - rich repeat ; PI , phosphoinositide . Subversion of the Mammalian Cell Cytoskeleton by Invasive Bacteria 2309 tracytoplasmic region of E - cadherin is linked to the cytoskele - ton through a complex of a and b catenins , and is needed for homophilic interactions and cell – cell adhesion . Interestingly , this region is not required for interaction between a E b 7 and E - cadherin ( 11 ) . Whether the cytoplasmic domain of E - cad - herin is involved in internalin - mediated entry is currently un - known . Internalin is not required for the entry of L . monocytogenes into a number of other cultured cell lines , suggesting that this bacterium has additional strategies for invasion . InlB , a surface protein that contains LRRs similar to those in InlA , mediates entry in cultured hepatocytes and in several epithelial or fi - broblast cell lines including HeLa , Chinese hamster ovary , Hep - 2 , and Vero ( 12 , 13 ) . The InlB receptor has not been identified yet . Tyrosine kinases are presumed to participate in both inter - nalin - and InlB - mediated entry , since inhibitors of such ki - nases block bacterial invasion . However , the kinases involved have not been identified . Another signaling protein needed for entry is the phosphoinositide ( PI ) - 3 kinase , p85 / p110 ( 13 ) . En - try of L . monocytogenes is impaired by treatment of host cells with specific inhibitors of this kinase or by expression of domi - nant negative form of p85 . In addition , in Vero cells PI - 3 ki - nase activity is stimulated within minutes after infection , indi - cating that L . monocytogenes activates host cell p85 / p110 . This activation requires InlB , tyrosine phosphorylation in the host cell and association of p85 with at least one host tyrosine phos - phorylated protein . How activation of PI - 3 kinase mediates uptake is unknown , but it is possible that this kinase controls changes in the actin cytoskeleton during entry . Treatment of Vero cells with cytochalasin D inhibits entry , but does prevent bacterial adhesion or activation of PI - 3 kinase , suggesting that stimulation of this kinase may precede cytoskeletal rearrange - ments . One attractive possibility , recently shown in platelets , is that the lipid products of PI - 3 kinase ( PI3 , 4P2 and PI3 , 4 , 5P3 ) may directly affect F - actin by uncapping barbed ends of actin filaments . Alternatively , PI - 3 kinase has been shown to regu - late the GTPase rac in fibroblasts , and it is possible that regu - lation of this G - protein by p85 - p110 is involved in entry of L . monocytogenes . Bacterial actin - based motility Bacteria such as L . monocytogenes , L . ivanovii , S . flexneri , and also several Rickettsiae have the capacity to move intracellu - larly using polymerization of host cell actin as a driving force for movement . These organisms have provided new tools to tackle the unsolved questions of actin - based motility and cell shape changes ( 14 ) . Actin polymerization and movement seem tightly coupled in both bacterial and mammalian systems , but there are important differences : in cells , actin polymerization is initiated at the plasma membrane where a signal is received ( for example , a chemoattractant in the case of neutrophils or a growth factor ) and transduced to the cytoskeletal machinery . In the case of bacteria , the process involves no membrane and no stimulus . The capacity to polymerize actin is roughly consti - tutive . In addition , bacteria are relatively easy to manipulate , i . e . , they are easy to grow and to store , and more importantly they can be genetically engineered . Hence , a real enthusiasm for bacterial actin - based motility emerged almost 10 yr ago with work performed mostly on L . monocytogenes and to a lesser extent on Shigella . Rickettsiae are strict intracellular bac - teria and are still difficult to manipulate . The Listeria actin comet tail . After entry , Listeria are trapped within vacuoles which are then rapidly lysed , releasing the bac - teria into the cytosol where they replicate and become covered with actin filaments ( F - actin ) . This actin coat then rearranges into a long tail which remains stationary in the cytoplasm and trails behind the moving bacteria . Bacteria migrate around the cytoplasm at speeds ranging from 6 to 60 m m min 2 1 with their tail lengths proportional to their speed , faster bacteria having longer tails ( up to 40 m m ) . Decoration with S1 myosin heads revealed that the actin filaments in the Listeria tails are short ( 0 . 2 m m ) and oriented with their barbed ( fast polymerizing end ) towards the bacterium , suggesting that actin polymeriza - tion takes place at the bacterial surface . Video microscopy of Listeria - infected cells after microinjection of fluorescent or photoactivatable monomeric actin ( G - actin ) and a - actinin demonstrated that continuous assembly of actin microfila - ments , followed by their release and cross - linking , takes place at the posterior end of the bacterium , providing the propulsive force for movement . In contrast to actin polymerization that occurs only at the base of the actin tail , and at varying rates , ac - tin filament depolymerization occurs at a constant rate through - out the tail and in all tails . Bacterial movement can be analyzed in cell free systems such as cytoplasmic extracts of Xenopus laevis eggs or human platelets . The speed of bacterial movement and density pro - files of actin tails indicate that these extracts provide a reason - able substitute for the cytoplasm of mammalian cells . The bacterial factor ActA . The bacterial protein ActA is needed for polymerization of host actin and movement ( 9 , 14 ) . The gene encoding this 610 – amino acid protein , actA , was identified by analysis of mutants that formed microcolonies in - side cells , failed to polymerize actin , and did not spread from one cell to the other . ActA contains a highly charged amino - terminal domain , a central region made of four tandem pro - line - rich repeats and a carboxy - terminal region . Recent protein alignments highlight that ActA may be a composite protein with the central proline - rich region and the carboxy - terminal domain that can be aligned with human Zyxin , an 83 - kD actin - associated protein ( Goldsteyn , R . , E . Friedrich , and D . Lou - vard , personal communication ) . The amino - terminal domain of ActA ( amino acids 12 – 233 ) has sequence homology ( 25 % identity ) with human vinculin ( amino acids 878 – 1065 ) , a pro - tein associated with stress fibers and focal adhesions ( Dehoux , P . , and P . Cossart , manuscript in preparation ) . In addition , the proline - rich region of ActA has homology with the proline - rich domain of vinculin . These sequence similarities under - score the role of ActA in actin assembly . One interesting property of ActA is its polar distribution on the bacterial surface , with highest concentration at one of the two poles . Establishment of ActA polarity is linked to bac - terial replication . In infected cells , ActA colocalizes with the base of the actin tail and determines both the site of actin as - sembly and direction of movement . Several approaches were used to demonstrate that ActA is sufficient to induce actin polymerization . , including transfec - tion of ActA in mammalian cells . However , this approach does not allow analysis of movement . Two other strategies were thus used . Expression of actA into the nonpathogenic bacte - rium L . innocua rendered this organism capable of actin based motility . In another approach , coating of Streptococcus pneu - moniae with a recombinant ActA - LytA hybrid protein re - sulted in decorated bacteria that polymerized actin and moved 2310 P . Cossart in a cell free system . However , movement only occurred after division had generated polar distribution of ActA . Thus , ex - pression of ActA and its polar distribution are required for ac - tin - based movement . The cellular proteins . Many proteins have been detected in the actin tails . They include : a - actinin , tropomyosin , fimbrin , ( plastin ) , profilin , vinculin , villin , ezrin ( radixin ) , talin , gelsolin , VASP , and the Arp2 / Arp3 complex . Only profilin and VASP colocalize with the base of the actin tails . Note that the actin concentration in the tail is so high compared with the rest of the cell that detection of a given actin - binding protein in the tail can only be considered relevant if a functional analysis has been performed . It is the case for a - actinin , profilin , VASP , and Arp2 / Arp3 . Microinjection of infected cells with a 53 - kD fragment of a - actinin , an actin cross - linking protein , causes the disappear - ance of bacteria containing filopodia and an arrest in move - ment suggesting that this fragment acts as a dominant negative protein and that cross - linking of actin filaments is important for movement . The role of profilin , a G - actin – binding protein which also has affinity for polyproline sequences , has been ad - dressed by depletion experiments or microinjection of proline - rich peptides . The fact that actin assembly and movement can occur in the absence of most profilin raises the possibility that profilin may not be as critical as originally thought . VASP is the first and only identified ligand of ActA . It can bind puri - fied ActA and also binds profilin , zyxin , and vinculin . Thus VASP could bring polymerization - competent profilin / actin complexes to bacteria by binding simultaneously to ActA and Profilin . Arp2 and Arp3 , two actin - related proteins , are com - ponents of an eight polypeptide complex purified from human platelets that has the capacity to initiate ActA - dependent actin polymerization around bacteria ( 15 ) . Arp2 and Arp3 localize at the surface of stationary bacteria and in the tails of locomot - ing bacteria . These unconventional actins which interact with actin might serve as a link between ActA and actin . Structure function analysis of ActA . Genetic analysis of actA has shown that the amino - terminal domain of ActA is neces - sary and sufficient to promote actin - based motility ( 9 , 14 , 16 ) . Yet , the central region is an active participant in the process and its presence stimulates by a factor of two the rate of move - ment . As revealed by immunofluorescence on cells infected with various mutants , VASP binds to the central proline - rich region , suggesting that VASP may not be absolutely essential for actin assembly . Transfection experiments and analysis of bacteria express - ing various actA mutations showed that the amino - terminal domain contains at least two critical regions ( 9 , 14 , 16 ) . The first region ( region T for tail formation ) spans residues 116 – 122 and is necessary for tail formation . Deletion of region T does not prevent actin assembly . The second region ( region C for continuity ) spanning amino acids 21 – 97 appears to be in - volved in the continuity of the actin polymerization process . Deletion of this region leads to an intriguing phenotype of dis - continuous actin tails which may be due to disruption of the balance between the number of new free barbed ends gener - ated at the bacterial surface and capping of these barbed ends . In the wild - type situation , region C could act by protecting ac - tin filaments from capping proteins . In its absence , premature capping would occur and movement will stop until a certain number of free barbed ends available for polymerization have been generated at the bacterial surface . Current model for actA - mediated movement . Data available suggest that the amino - terminal domain of ActA generates free barbed ends either by recruiting or acting as a nucleator or by severing actin filaments or by uncapping actin filaments . Polymerization then ensues and depends on the maintenance of these free barbed ends . Filaments are then released , capped , and cross - linked , generating the tail . The central region of ActA binds VASP which can bind profilin or profilin / actin complexes . An attractive possibility is that profilin / actin com - plexes attracted by VASP in the vicinity of the bacteria can bind to free barbed ends with further release of the free profi - lin , thereby participating to the dynamic of the process . This hypothesis would explain why profilin and VASP are only found at the site of actin polymerization . The Arp2 / Arp3 com - plex appears as a good candidate for interacting with both ActA and actin . It is tempting to speculate that the Arp2 / Arp3 complex interacts with the amino - terminal domain of ActA and acts as a link between actin and ActA but this hypothesis awaits experimental evidence . The recent observation that peptides encompassing the amino - terminal domain of ActA are able to bind actin reacti - vates the early hypothesis that ActA may interact directly with actin ( 16 ) . The observation that bacteria grown in broth do not nucleate actin efficiently has led to the suggestion that ActA may not be a nucleator or may have to be modified to bind ac - tin , or that it may recruit a nucleator . Another emerging possi - bility , however , is that ActA ( as shown previously in the case of vinculin ) could contain cryptic actin - binding sites which need to be unmasked to become accessible to actin . The re - cently discovered homology between the amino - terminal do - main of ActA and the actin - binding domain of vinculin under - scores this possibility . Finally , the discovery of a mutant moving discontinuously suggests that ActA may also play a role in protecting free barbed ends from uncapping ( 16 ) . The Shigella actin - based motility . Like Listeria , Shigella can move intracellularly . Intriguingly , the bacterial gene used , icsA , encodes a protein with no homology to ActA ( 14 ) . This protein is also polarly distributed on the bacterial surface . IcsA was shown recently to bind vinculin ( 17 ) . Whether ActA and IcsA activate the same signaling cascade is under investigation . Conclusions Bacterial pathogens have developed strategies to maximally exploit the exceptional properties of the actin cytoskeleton during entry and intracellular movement . Interactions be - tween pathogens and the cytoskeleton also occur in other in - stances . For example , adhesive bacteria , such as EPEC , also require an active cytoskeleton at the site of bacterium cell con - tact to adhere tightly with the host cell . The signals underlying this adherence are currently being elucidated . All the interac - tions described above require cytoskeleton rearrangements stimulated by the pathogen , but there are examples where the pathogen inhibits activity of the cytoskeleton . It is the case for some toxins which modify actin directly , such as the C2 toxin of Clostridium botulinum or indirectly like the C3 toxin acting on Rho . One of the most sophisticated systems is the Yop system of Yersinia . Indeed , in addition to strategies to invade mamma - lian cells , these bacteria have evolved strategies to inhibit their phagocytosis by phagocytes . Upon contact with the macro - phage , the Yersinia inject within the macrophage , via a type III secretion system , several proteins , in particular YopE which can paralyze the cytoskeleton and thus prevent phagocytosis Subversion of the Mammalian Cell Cytoskeleton by Invasive Bacteria 2311 ( 2 ) . Exploitation of the cytoskeleton is not limited to bacterial pathogens since its has been discovered recently that a vaccinia virus can move intracellularly ( 18 ) . It is clear that the challenge for the future will be to determine and compare the stimuli that generate free actin barbed ends , an absolute requirement for cytoskeletal rearrangements .
