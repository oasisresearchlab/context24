INTRODUCTION Diffusion in various types of lyotropic mixtures have been of increasing interest , not only since this is interesting in itself but also due to its biological relevance : tracer diffu - sion in networks (cid:1) of rods (cid:2) is probably relevant for mass transport of proteins in the cell . As such , most of the inves - tigations have been focused on diffusion of spherelike tracers in F - actin networks / cytoplasm and their mechanical proper - ties , where tracer spheres are sometimes used to probe mi - crorheological response . 1 – 11 To gain in fundamental understanding on diffusion of spheres through networks we have performed ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy (cid:1) FCS (cid:2) experiments on a relatively simple model system : apoferritin as a tracer particle and a (cid:1) isotropic or nematic (cid:2) network of feline distemper (cid:1) fd (cid:2) - virus particles . Apoferritin is a semispherical protein with a diam - eter of 12 . 8 nm , while fd virus is a very long and thin rod (cid:1) contour length of 880 nm and thickness of 6 . 8 nm (cid:2) , which is relatively stiff (cid:1) persistence length is 2200 nm (cid:2) . Fd virus has been shown to be a very nice model system for rodlike col - loids which exhibit an isotropic - nematic - smectic phase transition . 12 – 16 Some (cid:1) micro - (cid:2) rheological experiments have been performed on fd suspensions . 17 – 20 Mixtures of apofer - ritin and fd virus are stable at high salt concentrations (cid:1) ex - periments are done at 110 mM (cid:2) . The interactions between apoferritin and fd - virus particles and between different fd rods are therefore almost hard - core - like . The diameter of the tracer protein is small in comparison with the typical mesh size of the fd - virus network , and is comparable with the thickness of the rods . Spheres with a diameter substantially larger than the diameter of a rod do not dissolve in a lyotro - pic nematic . It is therefore natural to study diffusion of small spheres as far as nematic networks are concerned . The exist - ing theories on diffusion through networks / porous media are either microscopic theories where diffusion through “net - works” of ﬁxed spheres / points are considered (cid:1) see Refs . 21 – 24 and older references therein (cid:2) or phenomenological , qualitative results are derived (cid:1) see Refs . 25 – 27 (cid:2) . In Ref . 28 , the effect of a ﬁbrous medium on the concentration depen - dence of the gradient - diffusion coefﬁcient of spheres is dis - cussed . As far as we know , there is no microscopic theory a (cid:2) Electronic mail : j . k . g . dhont @ fz - juelich . de THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS 124 , 044907 (cid:1) 2006 (cid:2) 0021 - 9606 / 2006 / 124 (cid:2) 4 (cid:1) / 044907 / 17 / $ 23 . 00 © 2006 American Institute of Physics 124 , 044907 - 1 Downloaded 27 Jan 2006 to 134 . 94 . 162 . 14 .

For the open networks considered here , (cid:1) screened (cid:2) hydrodynamic interactions between the sphere and the rods determine the diffusive properties to a large extent . A semiquantitative theory is developed in the present paper to describe the diffusion of a small tracer sphere in an open network of stiff rods , within a similar framework as developed in Refs . 29 and 30 for ﬂexible poly - mers , where the prediction of the hydrodynamic screening length remains an open problem . In a previous paper , 31 diffusion of colloidal tracer spheres of various diameters in isotropic fd - virus suspen - sions , with concentrations substantially below the isotropic - nematic transition concentration , has been studied . FCS , dy - namic light - scattering , and video microscopy experiments were performed depending on the diameter of the tracer sphere . Furthermore , a theory is developed in that paper for tracer diffusion of large tracer spheres at low concentrations of rods . In the present paper the other limiting case of very small tracers is considered , both in isotropic and nematic rod dispersions . Diffusion of spherical - like tracers in other types of host matrices have also been investigated , such as aqueous solu - tions of polystyrene sulfonate , 32 dextran solution , 33 ﬂexible poly (cid:1) acrylamide (cid:2) gels , 34 agarose gels , 35 dendrites of cultured mitral cells , 36 polymer solutions , 37 semidilute DNA solutions , 38 and in dispersions of xanthan . 39 Little work has been done on tracer diffusion of rods . Van Bruggen et al . 40 , 41 used ﬂuorescence recovery after pho - tobleaching (cid:1) FRAP (cid:2) to study self - diffusion of Boehmite rods in concentrated dispersions , where both diffusions parallel and perpendicular to the nematic director are probed . The same technique has been employed by Lellig et al . 42 to probe diffusion of tobacco mosaic virus (cid:1) TMV (cid:2) in a host matrix of charged ﬂuorinated latex spheres . Video (cid:1) confocal (cid:2) micros - copy has been employed very recently to measure the self - diffusion coefﬁcient of fd virus in concentrated dispersion , again both parallel and perpendicular to the director . 43 There is a large difference between the diffusion coefﬁcients related to diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the director . The long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient can be obtained from the relation , 44 D s = k B T / (cid:1) p , (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) where k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T the temperature , and (cid:1) p the friction coefﬁcient of the tracer particle with its surround - ing , including both frictions with the solvent and interactions with other colloidal particles . The relation (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) can be derived from a Langevin equation in precisely the same way as the original Einstein relation for the diffusion coefﬁcient of a single sphere in an otherwise unbounded ﬂuid . The ﬂuctuat - ing force in the Langevin equation now includes forces due to interactions with other colloidal particles . Coarse graining to a time scale that is long in comparison with typical colloid relaxation times renders the correlation function of this ﬂuc - tuating force delta correlated in time . Such a delta correlation of forces leads to the relation between the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient and the friction coefﬁcient as given in Eq . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) . In case of tracer diffusion of a sphere through a network of rods , the friction coefﬁcient is generally deter - mined by both hydrodynamic and direct interactions of the tracer sphere with the rods . For tracer spheres which are small in comparison with the mesh size of the network , it will turn out that the hydrodynamic contribution is dominant . The friction coefﬁcient connects a small external force F ext acting on the sphere with the resulting ensemble - averaged velocity v p of the tracer sphere as F ext = (cid:1) p v p . (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) In order to obtain the friction coefﬁcient (cid:1) , one should thus calculate the ensemble - averaged velocity of the tracer sphere due to a small external force . The relation (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) no longer holds in case the dynamics of the network is very slow , such that the duration of an experi - ment is not very much larger than the corresponding network relaxation time . In this case , the above - mentioned coarse graining to render forces delta correlated in time is not achieved . Anomalous diffusion will then be observed in the sense that the mean - squared displacement is not linear in time . Diffusion properties should now be obtained from an analysis of the Langevin equation where the forces are not delta correlated . In the absence of such anomalous diffusion , the follow - ing two limiting cases can be distinguished when considering self - diffusion of spheres in networks of rods . (cid:1) i (cid:2) The size of the tracer sphere is large compared with the mesh size of the network of the rods . In this case , microstructural order of the network of rods is se - verely distorted as the tracer sphere is pulled through the network (cid:3) as depicted in Fig . 1 (cid:1) a (cid:2)(cid:4) . The rod con - centration is enhanced in front of the moving tracer sphere , while it is decreased in its wake . In addition , orientational order of rods around the tracer sphere will be affected . The accompanied distortion of the tracer - host pair - correlation function determines the friction coefﬁcient . Hydrodynamic interactions be - FIG . 1 . (cid:1) a (cid:2) The effective friction coefﬁcient for a big sphere is preliminary determined by the distortion of the pair - correlation function g between the tracer sphere and the rods . Here , microstructural order of the network is severely distorted on pulling the tracer sphere through the network . (cid:1) b (cid:2) For a small sphere in an open network , hydrodynamic interactions with the essentially undistorted network determine the effective friction coefﬁcient . (cid:1) c (cid:2) Even when the network structure is not affected by pulling the tracer sphere through the network , the pair - correlation function g will be distorted by the external force on the tracer sphere . The gray circle is a cross section through the core of a rod . The (cid:2) and (cid:3) denote an increased and decreased pair - correlation function due to “shadowing , ” respectively . 044907 - 2 Kang et al . J . Chem .

(cid:1) ii (cid:2) The size of the tracer sphere is small compared with the mesh size of the network . In this case the distortion of microstructural order of the network as the tracer sphere is pulled through is much less important , since the sphere can simply move through the “holes” in the network . Microstructural order of the rod network can be considered unaffected by the tracer sphere . The effective friction coefﬁcient is now determined by hy - drodynamic interactions between the tracer sphere and the rods (cid:3) see Fig . 1 (cid:1) b (cid:2)(cid:4) as well as the distortion of the pair - correlation function for tracer sphere and rods . Although the network structure is unaffected by pulling the small tracer sphere through the network , the tracer - host pair - correlation function will still be distorted through the “probability shadow” that a rod creates (cid:3) as depicted in Fig . 1 (cid:1) c (cid:2)(cid:4) : the probability to ﬁnd the sphere above the rod is higher than below , since the sphere has to avoid the core of the rod on passing it . The latter phenomenon will be referred to here as the “shadowing effect . ” A variational approach has been developed in Ref . 31 for case (cid:1) i (cid:2) for rod concentrations below the overlap concentra - tion . For higher concentrations , above the overlap concentra - tion , correlations between different rods must be included . The variational approach might be generalized to take such correlations into account . In the present paper , we will consider case (cid:1) ii (cid:2) , where microstructural order of the network is not affected by the tracer sphere . Hydrodynamic interactions as well as the “shadowing distortion” of the pair - correlation function will be addressed in the present paper . Theoretical predictions for the hydrodynamic and shadowing contributions to the diffu - sion coefﬁcient are made in Sec . II . Due to strong entangle - ment of the rods , hydrodynamic interactions between the tracer sphere and the rods are screened . There is no indepen - dent theory for the screening length . The screening length will be an adjustable parameter when comparing experimen - tal results with the theory developed in Sec . II . At the end of the theoretical summary in Sec . II C we will show that the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient is equal to Fick’s gradient diffusion coefﬁcient , provided that the network structure is not affected by the presence of the tracer spheres . The long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient is thus relevant for mass trans - port of dilute dispersions of small spheres in open networks . Section III introduces the colloidal particles that have been used in the experimental study . In Sec . IV tracer diffusion coefﬁcients as obtained from FCS are presented , and the theory discussed in Sec . II is used to extract the hydrody - namic screening length from these data , both for isotropic and nematic networks of rods . Section V is a summary and discussion . II . THEORY In this section , tracer diffusion of a small sphere through an open network is discussed , corresponding to the limiting situation of case (cid:1) ii (cid:2) mentioned in the Introduction . In such an open network , the structure of the network will only be slightly affected when pulling the small tracer sphere through the network . Neglecting the network distortion , hydrody - namic interaction of the tracer sphere with the rods and the shadowing effect determine the diffusion coefﬁcient . The hy - drodynamic contribution is discussed in Sec . II A and the shadowing effect is discussed in Sec . II B . As will turn out , the hydrodynamic contribution is dominant over the shadow - ing effect for small tracer spheres . A . The hydrodynamic contribution Consider the tracer sphere on which an external force F ext acts which is such that it sustains a prescribed velocity v p of the tracer particle . The moving tracer sphere induces a ﬂuid ﬂow u 0 (cid:3) see Fig . 2 (cid:1) a (cid:2)(cid:4) . Each of the rods in the network will reﬂect the incident ﬂow ﬁeld u 0 . The ﬂuid ﬂow u r that is reﬂected by each rod affects the force F ext that is necessary to sustain the prescribed velocity of the tracer sphere (cid:3) see Figs . 2 (cid:1) b (cid:2) and 2 (cid:1) c (cid:2)(cid:4) . This contributes to the effective friction co - efﬁcient of the sphere , and thus to a rod - concentration - dependent diffusion coefﬁcient . Since the network is as - sumed to be relatively open to the tracer sphere , higher - order reﬂections of ﬂow ﬁelds are relatively unimportant as com - pared with the leading order reﬂected ﬁeld u r by each indi - vidual rod . Second - and higher - order reﬂected ﬁelds will be neglected . Considering hydrodynamic interaction between the tracer sphere and a given rod , there is an inﬂuence of the rods in between the sphere and the particular rod due to “hydrodynamic screening . ” Above the overlap concentration of rods , each rod is assumed to be entangled to such an extent that it will be ﬁxed in space on reﬂection of the inci - dent ﬂuid ﬂow u 0 . The force on each rod due to the incident ﬁeld u 0 is thus assumed to be counterbalanced by its inter - actions with other rods in the network . The total force that the ﬂow u 0 exerts on the rod is thus nonzero , which leads to hydrodynamic screening . Both the ﬁeld u 0 generated by the moving sphere and the reﬂected ﬂow ﬁeld u r from a given rod traverse through the network of entangled rods , as de - picted in Figs . 2 (cid:1) b (cid:2) and 2 (cid:1) c (cid:2) . The hydrodynamic inﬂuence of the rods , intermediate between the sphere and the particular rod under consideration , can be described in a mean - ﬁeld approximation by adding a body force to the creeping ﬂow equations . This body force is equal to the total force (cid:1) per unit volume (cid:2) that the entangled rods exert on the ﬂuid . The force with which a single rod , immersed in a ﬂow ﬁeld u , acts onto the ﬂuid is equal to FIG . 2 . (cid:1) a (cid:2) The ﬂow ﬁeld u 0 generated by a moving sphere in an unbounded ﬂuid . (cid:1) b (cid:2) The ﬂow ﬁeld u 0 generated by the moving sphere traverses through the network before reaching the rod with which hydrodynamic interaction is considered . (cid:1) c (cid:2) The reﬂected ﬂow ﬁeld u r from the rod under consideration traverses through the network back to the tracer sphere . 044907 - 3 Diffusion of spheres in suspensions of rods J .

This can be alternatively written as f = − (cid:6) 0 (cid:7) 2 u with (cid:7) = (cid:5) (cid:5) ¯ (cid:4) / (cid:6) 0 , (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) where (cid:6) 0 is the shear viscosity of the ﬂuid and “the hydro - dynamic screening length” 1 / (cid:7) is a measure for the distance over which screening becomes effective . Aside from body forces (cid:6) 0 (cid:3) 2 u due to friction , and body forces , (cid:3) p arising from gradients in the pressure p , there is now a body force (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) from the intervening rods between the tracer sphere and the particular rod under consideration . The creeping ﬂow equation is thus replaced by the Debye - Büche - Brinkman equation , (cid:6) 0 (cid:3) 2 u − (cid:3) p − (cid:6) 0 (cid:7) 2 u = 0 , (cid:3) · u = 0 . (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) The Green’s function for the ﬂuid ﬂow velocity of this equa - tion reads T s (cid:1) r (cid:2) = 1 4 (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 r (cid:3) h 1 (cid:1) x (cid:2) I ˆ + h 2 (cid:1) x (cid:2) r ˆ r ˆ (cid:4) , h 1 (cid:1) x (cid:2) = − x −2 + exp (cid:6) − x (cid:7)(cid:1) 1 + x −1 + x −2 (cid:2) , h 2 (cid:1) x (cid:2) = 3 x −2 − exp (cid:6) − x (cid:7)(cid:1) 1 + 3 x −1 + 3 x −2 (cid:2) , (cid:1) 7 (cid:2) where I ˆ is the identity and x = (cid:7) r , with r the distance between the positions of the point where a force acts and the point where the resulting ﬂuid ﬂow velocity is measured , while r ˆ = r / r is the unit vector along r . The subscript s stands for “screening . ” For short distances or long screening lengths , h 1 (cid:1) x (cid:2) = 1 / 2 = h 2 (cid:1) x (cid:2) for x ↓ 0 , (cid:1) 8 (cid:2) in which case the screened Oseen tensor (cid:1) 7 (cid:2) reduces to the Oseen tensor for the creeping ﬂow equations in the absence of the body force (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) . Contrary to the Oseen tensor , the screened Oseen tensor varies like (cid:8) r −3 for large distances . This will turn out to be important for the convergence of ensemble averages that determine the diffusion coefﬁcient . For a nematic network of rods , the screening length is in principle anisotropic . However , since the ﬂow induced by a sphere is stronger in the direction of motion of the sphere , it will be assumed here that the most important contributions to hydrodynamic interactions relates to the ﬂuid ﬂow in the direction of motion of the tracer sphere (cid:1) which is either par - allel or perpendicular to the director of the nematic network (cid:2) . The validity of this assumption needs further theoretical work , where the Green’s function of the Debye - Büche - Brinkman equation with an anisotropic screening should be computed . As far as we know this has not been done yet , and is outside the scope of the present paper . The mean - ﬁeld concept of hydrodynamic screening makes sense only when the hydrodynamic screening length 1 / (cid:7) is larger than the mesh size of the network . For the open networks under consideration , the mesh size is much larger than both the thickness D of the rods and the diameter 2 a of the tracer sphere . We shall therefore assume hereafter that (cid:7) D and (cid:7) a are small numbers . The induced hydrodynamic force distribution over the surface of the tracer sphere is therefore not affected by screening . Furthermore , the typical distance between the tracer sphere and rods in the relatively open network will be large in comparison with the radius of the sphere . Within these limits , the velocity ﬁeld u 0 of the moving tracer sphere with velocity v p in an otherwise quies - cent and unbounded , screened ﬂuid is equal to u 0 (cid:1) r (cid:2) = 6 (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 a T s (cid:1) r − r p (cid:2) · v p , (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) with r p the position of the center of the sphere . Once the reﬂected ﬁeld u r by a rod immersed in the velocity ﬁeld u 0 is known , the force F ext on the tracer sphere that is necessary to maintain its velocity v p follows from Faxén’s theorem for a Debye - Büche - Brinkman ﬂuid . 28 Since the screening length is large in comparison with the radius of the sphere , however , Faxén’s theorem for an unscreened ﬂuid can be used here , that is , F ext = 6 (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 a (cid:3) v p − u r (cid:1) r = r p (cid:2)(cid:4) , (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) where it is assumed that the variation of the reﬂected ﬂow ﬁeld over the sphere’s surface can be neglected . This is typi - cally the case for the small sphere in the open network of rods under consideration here . The calculation of the ﬁeld u r that is reﬂected by a single rod immersed in the ﬂow ﬁeld u 0 proceeds as follows . The rod under consideration is modeled as a rigid string of 2 m + 1 spherical beads with diameter D equal to the thick - ness of the rod . Each bead is indexed by a number (cid:9) , which ranges from − m to + m . The value of m is set by the aspect ratio as 2 m + 1 = L / D , with L the length of the rod . The po - sition coordinate of the (cid:9) th bead is written as r c + D (cid:9) u ˆ , where r c is the center position of the rod (cid:1) the position the bead with index number 0 (cid:2) , and the unit vector u ˆ deﬁnes the orientation of the long axis of the rod . The ﬂuid ﬂow velocity u r (cid:1) r (cid:2) at point r that is reﬂected by the rod after insertion in the ﬂow ﬁeld u 0 generated by the moving sphere is thus written as a sum over beads which constitute the rod under consideration , u r (cid:1) r (cid:2) = (cid:9) (cid:9) T s (cid:1) r − r c − D (cid:9) u ˆ (cid:2) · F (cid:9) h , (cid:1) 11 (cid:2) where F (cid:9) h is the force that bead (cid:9) exerts on the ﬂuid . As before , the assumption here is that the hydrodynamic screen - ing length is large as compared with the thickness of the rod . For the open networks under consideration , the incident ﬂow u 0 varies little over distances of order D , so that Faxén’s theorem for bead (cid:9) reads F (cid:9) h = 3 (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 D (cid:3) v (cid:9) − u (cid:9) (cid:1) (cid:1) r = r c + D (cid:9) u ˆ (cid:2)(cid:4) , (cid:1) 12 (cid:2) where v (cid:9) is the velocity of bead (cid:9) , and u (cid:9) (cid:1) is the total ﬂow velocity that would exist in the absence of bead (cid:9) (cid:1) as indi - cated by the (cid:1) (cid:2) . Assuming that the rod is ﬁxed in space , v (cid:9) = 0 . (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) Furthermore , the velocity u (cid:1) that would have existed in the absence of bead (cid:9) is equal to 044907 - 4 Kang et al . J . Chem .

(cid:1) 14 (cid:2) Here , F (cid:10) h , (cid:1) is the force of bead (cid:10) on the ﬂuid , in the absence of bead (cid:9) . The use of the screened Oseen tensor here ac - counts for screening of the ﬂow ﬁeld generated by beads (cid:10) during its propagation to bead (cid:9) , typically over distances of the order of the length L of the rod . For very long and thin rods , the forces F (cid:10) h , (cid:1) are to a good approximation equal to the forces F (cid:10) h of the intact rod , except for the relatively small number of beads close to bead (cid:9) . This approximation leads to correct asymptotic expressions for friction coefﬁcients of single , very long , and thin rods . Hence , we will replace F (cid:10) h , (cid:1) by F (cid:10) h . The expressions (cid:1) 11 (cid:2) – (cid:1) 14 (cid:2) thus lead to the following “integral equation” for the hydrodynamic forces , F (cid:9) h 3 (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 D + u 0 (cid:1) r = r c + D (cid:9) u ˆ (cid:2) + (cid:9) (cid:10) (cid:4) (cid:9) T s (cid:1) D u ˆ (cid:1) (cid:9) − (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:2) · F (cid:10) h = 0 .

(cid:1) 16 (cid:2) The ﬁrst sum on the right - hand side is much larger than the second sum , since in the second sum the value of (cid:10) F (cid:10) h − F (cid:9) h (cid:10) / (cid:10) (cid:10) − (cid:9) (cid:10) is typically much smaller than (cid:10) F (cid:9) h (cid:10) / (cid:10) (cid:10) − (cid:9) (cid:10) . The second sum is therefore neglected . In addition , for very long and thin rods , for the majority of beads , the ﬁrst sum is only slightly depending on (cid:9) . The (cid:9) dependence in the ﬁrst sum will therefore be neglected . These two approximations (cid:3) ne - glecting the second sum in Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) and neglecting end ef - fects in the ﬁrst sum (cid:4) are discussed in detail in Appendix A , where it is shown that the errors made are typically about 10 % . Hence , Eq .

(cid:1) 15 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) for the incident ﬁeld u 0 thus leads to an explicit expression for the hydrody - namic forces on beads , F (cid:9) h = − 12 (cid:1) (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 (cid:2) 2 Da G (cid:1) (cid:7) D , (cid:7) L (cid:2) (cid:11) (cid:11) I ˆ − H (cid:1) (cid:7) D , (cid:7) L (cid:2) G (cid:1) (cid:7) D , (cid:7) L (cid:2) + H (cid:1) (cid:7) D , (cid:7) L (cid:2) u ˆ u ˆ (cid:13) · T s (cid:1) R − D (cid:9) u ˆ (cid:2) · v p , (cid:1) 22 (cid:2) where R = r p − r c is the distance between the centers r p and r c of the sphere and the rod , respectively . The ﬁrst term on the left - hand side of the integral equation (cid:1) 15 (cid:2) is logarithmically in L / D smaller than the bead - index sum , and is therefore neglected . From the expression (cid:1) 11 (cid:2) for the reﬂected ﬂow ﬁeld and Faxén’s theorem (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) it thus ﬁnally follows that F ext = 6 (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 a (cid:3) I ˆ + (cid:14) M (cid:1) R , u ˆ (cid:2)(cid:15)(cid:4) · v p , (cid:1) 23 (cid:2) with the tensor M is equal to M (cid:1) R , u ˆ (cid:2) = 12 (cid:1) (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 (cid:2) 2 a G (cid:1) (cid:7) D , (cid:7) L (cid:2) (cid:12) − (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) L (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) L dl T s (cid:1) R − l u ˆ (cid:2) · (cid:16) I ˆ − H (cid:1) (cid:7) D , (cid:7) L (cid:2) G (cid:1) (cid:7) D , (cid:7) L (cid:2) + H (cid:1) (cid:7) D , (cid:7) L (cid:2) u ˆ u ˆ (cid:17) · T s (cid:1) R − l u ˆ (cid:2) , (cid:1) 24 (cid:2) where , as before , the bead - index sum is replaced by a con - tour integral . The brackets (cid:14) ¯ (cid:15) in Eq . (cid:1) 23 (cid:2) denote ensemble averaging with respect to the degrees of freedom of the sphere and rod . In order to account for the N rods in the network , Eq . (cid:1) 23 (cid:2) is written as 044907 - 5 Diffusion of spheres in suspensions of rods J . Chem .

(cid:1) 25 (cid:2) The assumption here is that ﬂow ﬁelds that are reﬂected by a rod to another rod back to the sphere are relatively weak . As mentioned before , for the open network under consideration , this is probably a good approximation . The probability density function with respect to which the ensemble average should be evaluated is distorted as a result of the external force on the tracer sphere . This distor - tion is proportional to the external ﬁeld , and therefore gives rise to second - order terms in Eq . (cid:1) 25 (cid:2) . Since such nonlinear terms are irrelevant for the calculation of the diffusion coef - ﬁcient , the distortion of the probability density function can be neglected in the evaluation of the hydrodynamic contri - bution to the diffusion coefﬁcient . The expression (cid:1) 25 (cid:2) can thus simply be averaged with respect to the probability den - sity function (cid:1) PDF (cid:2) in the absence of an external force on the sphere . According to Eqs . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) , (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) , (cid:1) 24 (cid:2) , and (cid:1) 25 (cid:2) , this leads to the following expression for the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient D sh where only hydrodynamic interactions are ac - counted for (cid:1) as indicated by the superscript h , while the sub - script on (cid:9) h indicates that its value is different for isotropic and nematic suspensions where either diffusion parallel or perpendicular to the director is considered (cid:2) , D sh D 0 = 1 1 + (cid:9) iso , (cid:18) , (cid:1) h (cid:12) , (cid:1) 26 (cid:2) with (cid:12) = (cid:1) (cid:8) / 4 (cid:2) D 2 L (cid:5) ¯ the volume fraction of rods (cid:1) (cid:5) ¯ the num - ber density of rods (cid:2) , and where the coefﬁcient (cid:9) h is given by (cid:9) iso , (cid:18) , (cid:1) h = 4 V (cid:8) D 2 L v ˆ p · (cid:11) (cid:12) d r p (cid:12) d r c (cid:19) d u ˆ (cid:11) P 0 (cid:1) r p , r c , u ˆ (cid:10) (cid:12) (cid:2) M (cid:1) R , u ˆ (cid:2) (cid:13) · v ˆ p , (cid:1) 27 (cid:2) where v ˆ p = v p / (cid:13) p is the unit vector along the ensemble - averaged velocity of the tracer particle , and P 0 is the PDF for the positions r c and r p of the center of a rod and of the tracer particle , respectively , and the orientation u ˆ of a rod in the network . This PDF depends only on r c and r p through the distance R = r p − r c between the sphere and a rod . The sub - script “0” on P is used to indicate that this is the equilibrium PDF , in the absence of the external force on the sphere . The superscript “ h ” on (cid:9) stands for “hydrodynamic , ” to distin - guish it from the coefﬁcient (cid:9) deﬁned in Ref . 31 , which describes the effect of direct interactions . Furthermore , V is the volume of the system under consideration . For a homo - geneous network , the PDF P 0 is simply equal to P 0 (cid:1) r p , r c , u ˆ (cid:10) (cid:12) (cid:2) = 1 V 2 P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:10) (cid:12) (cid:2) exp (cid:6) − (cid:10) V (cid:1) R , u ˆ (cid:2)(cid:7) , (cid:1) 28 (cid:2) where P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:10) (cid:12) (cid:2) is the PDF for the orientation of a rod , (cid:10) = 1 / k B T (cid:1) with k B is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the tem - perature (cid:2) , and V (cid:1) R = r p − r c , u ˆ (cid:2) is the pair - interaction potential for a rod and the tracer sphere . Indirect interactions between the sphere and a rod , mediated by surrounding rods , are ne - glected here . These indirect forces are small for the small tracer sphere in the relatively open network . The expression (cid:1) 27 (cid:2) can thus be written as (cid:9) iso , (cid:18) , (cid:1) h = 4 (cid:8) D 2 L v ˆ p · (cid:11) (cid:12) d R (cid:19) d u ˆ P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:10) (cid:12) (cid:2) (cid:11) exp (cid:6) − (cid:10) V (cid:1) R , u ˆ (cid:2)(cid:7) M (cid:1) R , u ˆ (cid:2) (cid:13) · v ˆ p . (cid:1) 29 (cid:2) In the above results , it is assumed that the force on the tracer sphere is colinear with its velocity . This is the case we con - sider in the experimental section , where diffusion in an iso - tropic network is considered , as well as diffusion in a nem - atic rod suspension either parallel or perpendicular to the nematic director . The more general case where the force and velocity are not colinear with the nematic director can be described as a linear combination of the colinear geometries . For an isotropic network , P (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:10) (cid:12) (cid:2) is simply equal to 1 / 4 (cid:8) . For a nematic network however , this PDF depends on the concentration of rods , since the degree of alignment in - creases with increasing concentration . The following , reason - ably accurate Gaussian representation for this PDF will be used (cid:1) similar to the Gaussian approximation that Odijk used in Ref . 45 in his treatment of Onsager’s prediction 46 of isotropic - nematic phase transition (cid:2) , P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:10) (cid:12) (cid:2) = 1 N (cid:1) C (cid:2)(cid:3) exp (cid:6) − C (cid:14) 2 (cid:7) + exp (cid:6) − C (cid:1) (cid:8) − (cid:14) (cid:2) 2 (cid:7)(cid:4) , 0 (cid:15) (cid:14) (cid:16) (cid:8) , (cid:1) 30 (cid:2) where (cid:14) is the angle between u ˆ and the nematic director . The parameter C measures the width of the orientational dis - tribution . Furthermore , N is the normalization constant , which is a unique function of C . Note that , for the uniaxial nematic under consideration here , the symmetry condition (cid:14) ↔ (cid:1) (cid:8) − (cid:14) (cid:2) is satisﬁed by the above expression . The con - stants N and C are determined as functions of the fd concen - tration from experimental values for the order parameter for fd virus in 110 mM buffer as a function of concentration , as determined from x - ray scattering data 47 (cid:1) see the inset in Fig . 3 (cid:2) . Without hydrodynamic screening , the screened Oseen tensor in Eq . (cid:1) 24 (cid:2) for the tensor M becomes equal to the Oseen tensor , which varies like (cid:8) R −1 . The integrand in Eq . (cid:1) 29 (cid:2) thus varies like (cid:8) R −2 for large distances , so that (cid:9) h diverges . This was already noted by Altenberger in case of diffusion through a set of ﬁxed point scatterers . 21 , 23 The screened Oseen tensor , however , varies like (cid:8) R −3 for large distances , which renders (cid:9) convergent . Hydrodynamic screening is thus an essential feature in describing self - diffusion through networks of rods . Note that the effective upper limit for the R integration in Eq . (cid:1) 29 (cid:2) is set by the hydrodynamic screening length . The numerical value of dif - fusion coefﬁcients is thus quite sensitively depending on the precise value of (cid:7) . Numerical results for the coefﬁcient (cid:9) h are given in Fig . 3 (cid:1) a (cid:2) for an isotropic fd network and in Fig . 3 (cid:1) b (cid:2) for a nematic fd network (cid:1) length of an fd virus particle is L = 880 nm and its thickness is D = 6 . 8 nm (cid:2) . The curves in Fig . 3 (cid:1) a (cid:2) marked with the numbers “1” and “5” refer to spheres with a diam - 044907 - 6 Kang et al . J . Chem .

The coefﬁcient (cid:9) h decreases with decreasing screening length . The coefﬁcient (cid:9) h is ap - proximately proportional to the size of the tracer sphere for large screening lengths , which can be seen explicitly from Eq . (cid:1) 24 (cid:2) for the tensor M . As can be seen from Fig . 3 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , the coefﬁcient (cid:9) h is about a factor of 2 larger for diffusion per - pendicular as compared with diffusion parallel to the direc - tor . Diffusion is thus predicted to be faster along the nematic director than perpendicular to the director , as far as the hy - drodynamic contribution is concerned . B . The shadowing contribution There are two different conﬁgurations of the rod relative to the external force acting on the tracer sphere that need to be considered : u ˆ (cid:18) F ext and u ˆ (cid:1) F ext (cid:1) as depicted in Figs . 4 (cid:1) a (cid:2) and 4 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , respectively (cid:2) . In case u ˆ (cid:18) F ext , the pair - correlation function is mainly distorted when the sphere interacts with the tips of the rod . In case u ˆ (cid:1) F ext the distortion is effective over the entire contour of the rod , and is therefore much more pronounced . We shall thus consider the case where u ˆ (cid:1) F ext and construct the distortion of the pair - correlation function for arbitrary orientations of the rod from these two special cases . Furthermore , since the diameter of the sphere is small compared with the length of the rod , end effects will be neglected , that is , the rod is taken inﬁnitely long . In the overdamped limit , on the Brownian time scale , inertial forces on the tracer sphere are very small as com - pared with all other forces . The resulting force balance im - plies that F ext − (cid:3) V − k B T (cid:3) ln (cid:6) g (cid:7) + F h = 0 , (cid:1) 31 (cid:2) where (cid:3) is the gradient operator with respect to the position coordinate of the tracer sphere . Furthermore , V is the poten - tial that is set up by a rod , which is again assumed to be ﬁxed in space due to entanglement forces , g is the pair - correlation function , and F h is the force with which the ﬂuid acts on the sphere . The third term in Eq . (cid:1) 31 (cid:2) is the Brownian force . The hydrodynamic force on the tracer sphere has been calculated in the previous subsection as F h = − (cid:1) ph v , (cid:1) ph = 1 + (cid:9) h (cid:12) , (cid:1) 32 (cid:2) where v is the translational velocity of the sphere and where the coefﬁcient (cid:9) h is given in Eq . (cid:1) 29 (cid:2) . The interpretation in using (cid:1) ph as a prefactor here is that the sphere moves in an effective Debye - Büche - Brinkman ﬂuid . From the force bal - ance equation (cid:1) 31 (cid:2) it thus follows that , v = D sh (cid:3) (cid:10) F ext − (cid:10) (cid:3) V − (cid:3) ln (cid:6) g (cid:7)(cid:4) . (cid:1) 33 (cid:2) The diffusion coefﬁcient where both hydrodynamic and di - rect interactions are accounted for follows from Eqs . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) by ensemble averaging of Eq . (cid:1) 33 (cid:2) , v p (cid:20) (cid:14) v (cid:15) = D sh (cid:3) (cid:10) F ext − (cid:10) (cid:14) (cid:3) V (cid:15) − (cid:14) (cid:3) ln (cid:6) g (cid:7)(cid:15)(cid:4) . (cid:1) 34 (cid:2) When the distortion of the pair correlation is neglected , g is equal to g = exp (cid:6) − (cid:10) V (cid:7) (cid:1) no distortion (cid:2) , (cid:1) 35 (cid:2) so that Eq . (cid:1) 34 (cid:2) reduces to v p = D s h (cid:10) F ext (cid:1) no distortion (cid:2) , (cid:1) 36 (cid:2) which implies that the diffusion coefﬁcient is equal to D sh , as it should . Including the distortion of g leads to additional contributions to D s due to direct interactions of the tracer sphere with the rods . In order to evaluate the ensemble average in Eq . (cid:1) 34 (cid:2) , g must be known explicitly . Thus we have to solve the conti - nuity equation , (cid:5) g (cid:5) t = (cid:3) · (cid:1) v g (cid:2) = D sh (cid:3) · (cid:3) (cid:10) g F ext − (cid:10) g (cid:3) V − (cid:3) g (cid:4) , (cid:1) 37 (cid:2) where Eq . (cid:1) 33 (cid:2) for the velocity has been used . Neglecting end effects , the pair - correlation function is a function of the cylindrical coordinates (cid:17) and (cid:5) (cid:3) see Fig . 4 (cid:1) c (cid:2)(cid:4) . Since we are interested in the linear relationship be - tween the external force on the tracer sphere and the result - FIG . 3 . (cid:1) a (cid:2) The coefﬁcient (cid:9) h as a function of (cid:7) L for isotropic fd (cid:1) length of an fd virus particle is L = 880 nm and its thickness is D = 6 . 8 nm (cid:2) for three different tracer spheres : “apo” refers to apoferritin which has a diameter of 12 . 8 nm , while the number 1 D and 5 D refer to spheres with a diameter of D and 5 D , respectively .

The insert shows the concentration dependence of S as a func - tion of fd concentration for a salt concentration of 110 mM , which complies with the experiments described later . The data for the insert are taken from Ref . 47 . FIG . 4 .

The pair - correlation function is therefore written as (cid:3) with g 0 (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) = exp (cid:6) − (cid:10) V (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2)(cid:7) the undistorted pair - correlation func - tion (cid:4) g (cid:1) (cid:5) , (cid:17) (cid:2) = g 0 (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2)(cid:3) 1 + cos (cid:6) (cid:17) (cid:7) L (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) F ext (cid:4) . (cid:1) 38 (cid:2) Substitution into Eq . (cid:1) 37 (cid:2) and transforming to cylindrical co - ordinates leads to the following equation for the function L : (cid:10) dg 0 (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) d (cid:5) + d d (cid:5) (cid:11) g 0 (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) dL (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) d (cid:5) (cid:13) − g 0 (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) L (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:5) 2 = 0 . (cid:1) 39 (cid:2) In case of hard - core interactions , this equation reduces for (cid:5)(cid:18) a + D / 2 to d 2 L (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) d (cid:5) 2 − L (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:5) 2 = 0 , (cid:1) 40 (cid:2) since V (cid:1) (cid:5)(cid:18) a + D / 2 (cid:2) = 0 , and hence g 0 (cid:1) (cid:5)(cid:18) a + D / 2 (cid:2) = 1 . The solution which vanishes for (cid:5) → (cid:19) of this equation is L (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) = A / (cid:5) (cid:20) with (cid:20) = 1 2 (cid:3) 1 + (cid:5) 5 (cid:4) = 1 . 618 . . . . (cid:1) 41 (cid:2) The integration constant A is determined as follows . For van - ishing (cid:21) , again in the case of hard - core interactions (cid:1) here (cid:22) is the one - dimensional delta distribution (cid:2) , we have dg 0 (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) d (cid:5) = (cid:22) (cid:1) (cid:5) − a − D / 2 (cid:2) for a + D / 2 − (cid:21)(cid:16) (cid:5)(cid:16) a + D / 2 + (cid:21) (cid:1) (cid:21) ↓ 0 (cid:2) . (cid:1) 42 (cid:2) Integrating the differential equation (cid:1) 39 (cid:2) from (cid:5) = a + D / 2 − (cid:21) to (cid:5) = a + D / 2 + (cid:21) and taking the limit of vanishing (cid:21) readily gives (cid:10) + dL (cid:1) (cid:5) = a + D / 2 (cid:2) d (cid:5) = 0 , (cid:1) 43 (cid:2) from which it follows that A = (cid:10) (cid:20) (cid:3) a + D / 2 (cid:4) 1 + (cid:20) . (cid:1) 44 (cid:2) According to Eq . (cid:1) 38 (cid:2) the distorted pair correlation thus reads g (cid:1) (cid:5) , (cid:17) (cid:2) = g 0 (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) (cid:11) 1 + (cid:10) cos (cid:6) (cid:17) (cid:7)(cid:3) a + D / 2 (cid:4) 1 + (cid:20) (cid:20)(cid:5) (cid:20) F ext (cid:13) . (cid:1) 45 (cid:2) Using this expression for the pair - correlation function , the ensemble averages on the right - hand side of Eq . (cid:1) 34 (cid:2) can be calculated . Multiplying the resulting “shadowing friction” due to the presence of a single rod with the number of rods in the system one ﬁnds (cid:10) (cid:14) (cid:3) V (cid:15) = 1 (cid:20) (cid:21) 1 + 2 a D (cid:22) 2 (cid:12)(cid:10) F ext , (cid:14) (cid:3) ln (cid:6) g (cid:7)(cid:15) = 0 .

The above calculation has been done for a rod with a ﬁxed orientation perpendicular to the direction of the exter - nal force (cid:3) see Fig . 4 (cid:1) a (cid:2)(cid:4) . For orientations parallel to the ex - ternal force (cid:3) see Fig . 4 (cid:1) b (cid:2)(cid:4) the “shadowing forces” are ex - pected to be much smaller . To within linear response in the external force , which is sufﬁcient for the calculation of the diffusion coefﬁcient , the ensemble - averaged forces can be written as a linear combination due to the component u ˆ u ˆ · F ext of the external force parallel to the rod and the com - ponent (cid:3) I ˆ− u ˆ u ˆ (cid:4) · F ext perpendicular to the rod . Hence , in Eq . (cid:1) 46 (cid:2) , the external force can simply be replaced by the com - ponent of the external force perpendicular to the rod’s orien - tation and averaged over the orientation of the rod , (cid:10) (cid:14) (cid:3) V (cid:15) = 1 (cid:20) (cid:21) 1 + 2 a D (cid:22) 2 (cid:12) (cid:19) d u ˆ P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:2)(cid:3) I ˆ − u ˆ u ˆ (cid:4) · (cid:10) F ext , (cid:1) 47 (cid:2) where , as before , P 0 is the probability density function of the orientation of a rod . Introducing the tensor Q (cid:20) 3 2 (cid:14) u ˆ u ˆ − 1 3 I ˆ (cid:15) (cid:20) 3 2 (cid:19) d u ˆ P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:2) (cid:3) u ˆ u ˆ − 1 3 I ˆ (cid:4) , (cid:1) 48 (cid:2) Eq . (cid:1) 48 (cid:2) can be written as (cid:10) (cid:14) (cid:3) V (cid:15) = 2 3 (cid:20) (cid:21) 1 + 2 a D (cid:22) 2 (cid:12) (cid:3) I − Q (cid:4) · (cid:10) F ext , (cid:1) 49 (cid:2) For an isotropic network , Q = 0 . For a nematic network , and for diffusion parallel to the director where F ext is colinear with the director , Q · F ext = S F ext , with S the largest eigenvalue of Q (cid:1) S is sometimes alternatively denoted as P 2 (cid:2) . For the uniaxial nematic under consideration , when F ext is perpen - dicular to the director , Q · F ext = − 1 2 S F ext . From the above ex - pression (cid:1) 49 (cid:2) and Eq . (cid:1) 34 (cid:2) it thus follows that the self - diffusion coefﬁcient D s , where both hydrodynamic interactions and shadowing are included , is equal to D s D 0 = D sh D ss D 02 , (cid:1) 50 (cid:2) where , as before , D sh = k B T / (cid:1) h is the diffusion coefﬁcient where only hydrodynamics is accounted for , and D ss is equal to D ss D 0 = 1 − (cid:9) iso , (cid:18) , (cid:1) s (cid:12) , (cid:1) 51 (cid:2) where (cid:9) iso s = 2 3 (cid:20) (cid:21) 1 + 2 a D (cid:22) 2 , (cid:9) (cid:18) s = 2 3 (cid:20) (cid:21) 1 + 2 a D (cid:22) 2 (cid:1) 1 − S (cid:2) , (cid:9) (cid:1) s = 2 3 (cid:20) (cid:21) 1 + 2 a D (cid:22) 2 (cid:21) 1 + 1 2 S (cid:22) , (cid:1) 52 (cid:2) for diffusion in an isotropic network and a nematic network parallel and perpendicular to the director , respectively . The diffusion coefﬁcient D ss is the diffusion coefﬁcient that incor - porates shadowing (cid:1) the superscript s stands for “shadow - ing” (cid:2) . Since direct interactions with just a single rod are in - dependently added , the results in Eqs . (cid:1) 51 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 52 (cid:2) must be 044907 - 8 Kang et al . J . Chem .

For the fd networks for which experiments will be dis - cussed later in this paper , typical volume fractions are of the order 0 . 01 . Putting in numbers in the numerators in Eq . (cid:1) 51 (cid:2) with 2 a / D of order 1 then reveals that the shadowing effect is very small . For larger tracer spheres , for which typically 2 a / D = 10 , the shadowing effect becomes relevant . C . Theoretical summary It follows from Eqs . (cid:1) 50 (cid:2) , (cid:1) 26 (cid:2) , and (cid:1) 51 (cid:2) that the self - diffusion coefﬁcient D s , where both hydrodynamic interac - tions and shadowing are accounted for , is equal to D s D 0 = 1 1 + (cid:9) iso , (cid:18) , (cid:1) h (cid:12) 1 1 + (cid:9) iso , (cid:18) , (cid:1) s (cid:12) . (cid:1) 53 (cid:2) Here , the coefﬁcient (cid:9) h accounts for screened hydrodynamic interactions and (cid:9) s accounts for the shadowing effect . The coefﬁcient (cid:9) h is given in Eq . (cid:1) 29 (cid:2) , which value depends on whether an isotropic or nematic network with diffusion par - allel or perpendicular to the director is considered . The co - efﬁcient (cid:9) s is given in Eq . (cid:1) 52 (cid:2) . Here , we have written 1 − (cid:9) s (cid:12) for convenience as 1 / (cid:1) 1 + (cid:9) s (cid:12) (cid:2) , which is allowed due to the small numerical value of (cid:9) s (cid:12) . The main rod - concentration dependence of the self - diffusion coefﬁcient originates from hydrodynamic interactions . The hydrodynamic - interaction coefﬁcient (cid:9) h depends on the aspect ratio p = L / D of the rods , the size ratio q = 2 a / L of the diameter of the tracer sphere and the length of the rods , and on the orientational order parameter S of the network through the orientational probability density function in Eq . (cid:1) 29 (cid:2) . In addition , (cid:9) h depends sensitively on the screening length 1 / (cid:7) . Hence , (cid:9) iso , (cid:18) , (cid:1) h (cid:20) (cid:9) h (cid:1) p , q , (cid:7) −1 / L , S (cid:2) . (cid:1) 54 (cid:2) The shadowing coefﬁcient (cid:9) s is , according to Eq . (cid:1) 52 (cid:2) a function of 2 a / D = q / p and S , (cid:9) iso , (cid:18) , (cid:1) s (cid:20) (cid:9) s (cid:1) q / p , S (cid:2) . (cid:1) 55 (cid:2) The parameters p and q as well as the orientational order parameter S can be measured independently . The unknown quantity is the hydrodynamic screening length . As far as we know , there is no independent theory for the screening length of networks of very long and thin rods . As a ﬁrst attempt one might consider a self - consistent calculation of the screening length , which is given in Appendix C . It turns out that at a somewhat higher fd concentration , the self - consistent screening length becomes of the order of the thickness of the rod , where the concept of screening breaks down . Comparing the above theory directly with experi - ments , however , leads to much larger screening length (cid:1) see Sec . IV (cid:2) . The probable reason for the failure of a self - consistent calculation is probably that the hydrodynamic ﬁeld that a rod experiences is never homogeneous over its whole length . A simple calculation of the friction coefﬁcient of a rod in an otherwise quiescent (cid:1) screened (cid:2) ﬂuid is there - fore unrealistic . The most severe approximation for nematic networks is the neglect of the anisotropy of screening . The argument given before is that hydrodynamic interactions are most pro - nounced in directions in which the tracer sphere is pulled through the network . To really quantify the effect of aniso - tropic screening , the corresponding Debye - Büche - Brinkman equation should be solved explicitly . So far this has not been done . Finally we will show that the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient is relevant for the mass transport of small spheres through a network , provided that the network is not distorted by the presence of the small sphere . Consider a homoge - neous suspension of rods in which spherical particles are dispersed with a small concentration gradient . When the con - centration of dispersed spheres is very small , so that they do not interact with each other , the only force a tracer sphere experiences is the Brownian force , − k B T (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:1) r , t (cid:2) (cid:1) where k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T is the temperature , and (cid:5) (cid:1) r , t (cid:2) is the number concentration of spheres at point r at time t (cid:2) . Replac - ing the external force in Eq . (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) by the Brownian force , the ensemble - averaged translational velocity v p (cid:1) r , t (cid:2) of a sphere at position r at time t is thus found to be equal to , v p (cid:1) r , t (cid:2) = − D s (cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:1) r , t (cid:2) . Substitution of this result into the continuity equation , (cid:5) (cid:5) (cid:1) r , t (cid:2) / (cid:5) t = − (cid:3) · (cid:3) v p (cid:1) r , t (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:1) r , t (cid:2)(cid:4) , immediately leads to Fick’s diffusion equation , (cid:5) (cid:5) t (cid:5) (cid:1) r , t (cid:2) = D s (cid:3) 2 (cid:5) (cid:1) r , t (cid:2) . The gradient diffusion constant for mass transport of tracer spheres in homogeneous networks of rods is thus equal to the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient of the spheres . This result relies on the assumption that the rod concentration is uni - form . The long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient is thus relevant for mass transport of spheres through homogeneous net - works of rods . III . THE COLLOIDAL SYSTEMS AND SAMPLE PREPARATION The bacteriophage fd is a rodlike molecule with a con - tour length of L = 880 nm , a bare diameter of D = 6 . 6 nm , a persistence length of P = 2200 nm , a molecular weight of M = 1 . 64 (cid:11) 10 7 g / mol , and a maximum charge density of 10 e / nm in water at p H = 8 . 15 . 48 The fd virus was grown and puriﬁed following standard biological protocols 49 using the XL1blue strain of E . coli as the host bacteria . The standard yield is ca . 15 mg of fd per liter of infected bacteria , and virus is typically grown in 6 l batches . The virus particles were ﬁnally puriﬁed by repeated centrifugation (cid:1) 10 5 g for 5 h (cid:2) and redispersed in a 20 mM tris - HCl buffer at p H 8 . 15 with 100 mM NaCl to screen the electrostatic interactions . The buffer contributes about 10 mM to the total ionic strength . Apoferritin is used as a tracer sphere . Ferritin is an iron storage protein , which is found in a variety of animals . It consists of a protein shell surrounding a ferrous core . This protein shell of ferritin is called apoferritin (cid:3) molecular weight (cid:1) MW (cid:2) , 450 – 475 kD (cid:4) . Apoferritin consists of 24 pep - tide subunits joined through noncovalent interactions . The 044907 - 9 Diffusion of spheres in suspensions of rods J . Chem .

From the point of view of colloid science , apoferritin is a very nice monodisperse model system of small and spherically shaped particles which , under proper conditions , can acquire a high surface charge density . Apoferritin solutions are perfectly monodisperse and relatively stable , i . e . , for weeks at room temperature and even for months at 4 °C . Apoferritin from horse spleen was purchased from SIGMA . The concentration of this sample was approximately 51 mg / ml , the sodium salt content was approximately 100 mM . Apoferritin was ﬂuo - rescently labeled with 5 (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) TAMRA - SE (cid:3) 5 (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) carboxytetram - ethylrhodamine , succinimidyl ester (cid:4) - Sigma - Aldrich , Product number C4759 , Lot 100k1600 . The dye was connected to the N terminus of the protein chain using a standard procedure . After labeling , apoferritin - TAMRA was puriﬁed from the free dye by dialysis using 10 kD ﬁlters (cid:1) millipore “ul - trafree” (cid:2) and centrifuged at 7500 g . There are several litera - ture values for the size of apoferritin (cid:1) see , for example , Refs . 50 – 55 (cid:2) . From these literature values we decided to use in our calculations a diameter of 12 . 8 nm . Literature values vary within about ±1 nm from this value . In order to be able to perform FCS measurements on nematic samples , homemade cuvettes were used with thick - nesses of 100 – 120 (cid:23) m . This ensures that the nematic direc - tor can be kept uniform over the thickness of the sample during a FCS measurement . The optical quality of capillaries turned out to be not good enough to ensure reproducible confocal volumes . Cover - glass optical quality is needed to render the confocal volume appropriately deﬁned . A piece of paraﬁlm with a circular hole in the middle of about 7 mm diameter was ﬁrmly pressed onto a microscope glass slide , as depicted in Fig . 5 . The paraﬁlm has thicknesses of 100 – 120 (cid:23) m . A drop of the sample with a volume of about 2 (cid:23) l is then carefully positioned in the middle of the circular hole . The sample should not touch the paraﬁlm . A cover glass with a thickness of about 80 (cid:23) m is then pressed upon this drop and the surrounding paraﬁlm . The drop touches the cover glass , so that the sample volume is a circular slice of liquid conﬁned between two glass surfaces . The cover glass is hold in place by tape that is wrapped around the sides of the microscope glass slide and the cover glass . During a measurement , the cover glass is on the down side , where the objective of the confocal microscope is positioned . We used a water immersion objective (cid:1) 63 (cid:11) / 1 . 2 W Korr Water Im - mersion Zeiss (cid:2) and focused from below into the middle of the sample . Other methods that we tried to ensure a stable drop position failed . In obtaining data for the nematic state , the sample was exposed to a magnetic ﬁeld of about 2 T for 10 min just before a FCS measurement . The polydomain structure of the sample is then transformed to a monodomain over the entire sample volume . The nematic director is cho - sen parallel to the cover glass . The measurement is done in the absence of the magnetic ﬁeld , where the monodomain structure survives for about 1 / 2 h . The degree of orienta - tional order is not affected by the magnetic pretreatment of the sample , since orientational order relaxes relatively fast as a result of local orientational diffusion of rods . The orienta - tion of the nematic director relative to the confocal volume is depicted in Fig . 7 . IV . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this section , FCS results will be presented together with a calculation of the concentration dependence of the hydrodynamic screening length from the experimental data using the theory described above . It is a nontrivial matter to extract diffusion coefﬁcients from FCS data of apoferritin in fd suspensions , since fd - virus particles ﬂuoresces by itself to some extent . Section IV A describes the procedure used to extract diffusion coefﬁcients from FCS data on these mix - tures , both for isotropic and nematic fd suspensions . In Sec . IV B the experimental data for the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient of apoferritin are presented and the concentration dependence of the hydrodynamic screening length is deter - mined from these data using the theory described above . A . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy „ FCS … on tracer spheres in isotropic and nematic fd - virus suspensions The standard form of a correlation function C f (cid:1) t (cid:2) mea - sured with FCS from a single - component solution of small spherical particles , at times larger than about 10 (cid:23) s where triplet contributions are absent , reads C f 0 (cid:8) (cid:11) 1 + D s t (cid:24) 12 (cid:13) −1 (cid:11) 1 + D s t (cid:24) 22 (cid:13) −1 / 2 , (cid:1) 56 (cid:2) where D s is the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient of the spherical particles . The superscript 0 refers to the standard form . Furthermore (cid:24) 1 and (cid:24) 2 are the linear dimensions of the confocal volume , perpendicular and parallel to the propaga - tion direction of the laser beam . These dimensions are de - ﬁned through the Gaussian intensity distribution I 0 (cid:1) r (cid:2) within the confocal volume as I 0 (cid:1) r (cid:2) (cid:8) exp (cid:6) − (cid:1) x 2 + y 2 (cid:2) / 2 (cid:24) 1 2 (cid:7) exp (cid:6) − z 2 / 2 (cid:24) 2 2 (cid:7) , (cid:1) 57 (cid:2) where the z direction is chosen as the propagation direction of the laser beam . Typically , (cid:24) 1 (cid:23) 200 nm and (cid:24) 2 (cid:23) 900 nm . For later reference , we shall rewrite Eq . (cid:1) 56 (cid:2) as C f 0 (cid:1) t (cid:10) (cid:25) (cid:2) (cid:8) (cid:11) 1 + t (cid:25) (cid:13) −1 (cid:11) 1 + 1 S 2 t (cid:25) (cid:13) −1 / 2 , (cid:1) 58 (cid:2) where the relaxation time (cid:25) is equal to FIG . 5 .

(cid:1) 60 (cid:2) Note that the last factor in Eq . (cid:1) 58 (cid:2) relates to diffusion in the propagation direction of the laser beam , while the ﬁrst factor is related to diffusion in the two perpendicular directions . For a mixture of small spherical , ﬂuorescent , noninteracting spheres , the measured ﬂuorescence correlation function is the sum of functions of the form (cid:1) 56 (cid:2) , with the corresponding relaxation times for the various species . When the ﬂuorescent spherical particles are not very small compared with the linear dimensions of the confocal volume , both (cid:24) 1 and (cid:24) 2 should be replaced by larger “effec - tive” dimensions , which will change the value of the struc - ture parameter . 31 This is due to the fact that when the rim of a particle enters the confocal volume , but its center is still outside , it will already contribute to the detected ﬂuorescent intensity . The apoferritin particles used in the present study are small enough to neglect this effective increase of the confocal dimensions . A complication with FCS experiments on mixtures of proteins and fd virus is that the nonspherical fd - virus par - ticles themselves contribute slightly to the ﬂuorescent inten - sity . The many proteins attached to the fd - virus particle prob - ably ﬂuoresce to some extent . In addition , a small amount of molecular impurity is present in our fd suspensions that con - tributes a small fraction to the total intensity . These two con - tributions have to be accounted for when interpreting FCS data on tracer solutions of protein in host suspensions of fd virus . Depending on whether the fd suspension is isotropic or nematic , the contributions other than that arising from the tracer protein are different . We shall discuss both in the fol - lowing subsections . 1 . Isotropic suspensions The molecular impurity in our fd suspensions mentioned above can be simply accounted for by an additional term in the correlation function of the standard form C f 0 (cid:1) t (cid:10) (cid:25) i (cid:2) in Eq . (cid:1) 58 (cid:2) , where (cid:25) i is the relaxation time of the impurity . The contribution of fd - virus particles is much more complicated for two reasons . First of all , fd virus is a nonspherical par - ticle with a length (cid:1) 1 (cid:23) m (cid:2) that is larger than the linear di - mensions of the confocal volume , so that rotational dynamics might affect the ﬂuorescence correlation function . Secondly , the effective linear dimensions of the confocal volume are larger than its geometrical dimensions , since again , fd virus is longer than the linear dimensions of the confocal volume . The effective structure parameter is not known . Correlation functions for fd solutions (cid:1) without protein (cid:2) can be written as a sum of the standard contribution from the molecular impu - rity and a contribution from fd particles (cid:1) the superscript b stands for background and the subscript i stands for impu - rity (cid:2) , C fb (cid:1) t (cid:10) A , (cid:25) 1 , (cid:25) 2 , (cid:25) i (cid:2) (cid:8) AC f fd (cid:1) t (cid:10) (cid:25) 1 , (cid:25) 2 (cid:2) + (cid:1) 1 − A (cid:2) C f 0 (cid:1) t (cid:10) (cid:25) i (cid:2) , (cid:1) 61 (cid:2) where A is the contribution of fd particles relative to the molecular impurity . The following function for the fd contri - bution to the background correlation function was found to ﬁt experimental data to high accuracy , C f fd (cid:1) t (cid:10) (cid:25) 1 , (cid:25) 2 (cid:2) (cid:8) (cid:11) 1 + t (cid:25) 1 (cid:13) −1 / 2 (cid:11) 1 + t (cid:25) 2 (cid:13) −1 . (cid:1) 62 (cid:2) This is the standard form of the correlation function , where formally , the structure parameter is left as an adjustable pa - rameter . Although there is no clear physical interpretation of the relaxation times (cid:25) 1 , 2 , these times probably incorporate both translational and rotational dynamics of fd particles as well as the effective structure parameter . The representation (cid:1) 62 (cid:2) of the contribution of fd particles to the measured cor - relation function is merely of practical importance in order to extract the protein contribution from experimental correla - tion functions . An example of a ﬁt of the correlation function to Eq . (cid:1) 61 (cid:2) is given in Fig . 6 (cid:1) a (cid:2) . Here , the concentration of fd - virus particles is 18 . 8 mg / ml (cid:1) the isotropic - nematic bin - odal concentration is 20 mg / ml (cid:2) . As can be seen , the ﬁt is very accurate , and will turn out to be sufﬁcient to extract diffusion data for proteins from their mixtures with fd . The ﬁt for this particular concentration gives A = 0 . 21 , (cid:25) i = 38 . 5 (cid:23) s , (cid:25) 1 = 600 (cid:23) s , and (cid:25) 2 = 7 . 0 (cid:11) 10 4 (cid:23) s . The relaxation time of the impurity is indeed of the order of what one ex - pects for a small molecule (cid:1) for free rhodamine the relaxation time is equal to 25 (cid:23) s (cid:2) . The correlation function for suspensions with a tracer amount of protein is now given by FIG . 6 . Typical ﬂuorescence correlation functions for pure isotropic fd at a concentration of 18 . 8 mg / ml (cid:1) a (cid:2) and for the mixture of apoferritin and iso - tropic fd virus (cid:1) b (cid:2) . The solid curves are ﬁts to the functions described in the main text . The solid curve marked “background” in (cid:1) b (cid:2) is the absolute con - tribution of the pure fd correlation function as plotted in (cid:1) a (cid:2) to the correla - tion function for the mixture . 044907 - 11 Diffusion of spheres in suspensions of rods J .

Here we added the appropriate base line and the amplitude which is related to the average number of particles N within the confocal volume . Once (cid:25) p is obtained , the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient D s relative to the Einstein diffusion co - efﬁcient D 0 is calculated from D s / D 0 = (cid:25) p 0 / (cid:25) p , (cid:1) 64 (cid:2) where (cid:25) p 0 is the relaxation time for dilute solutions of protein without fd virus as obtained from FCS data ﬁtted to the standard form (cid:1) 56 (cid:2) . The quantity (cid:25) p of interest is thus measured as follows . First determine the parameters A , (cid:25) 1 , (cid:25) 2 , and (cid:25) i , by ﬁtting correlation functions for fd suspensions (cid:1) without protein (cid:2) to Eqs . (cid:1) 61 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 62 (cid:2) . Add a very small amount of protein and then ﬁt the correlation function of the mixture to Eq . (cid:1) 63 (cid:2) with respect to the parameters A p and (cid:25) p , keeping A , (cid:25) 1 , (cid:25) 2 , and (cid:25) i ﬁxed to the earlier determined values . A correlation function with a tracer amount of apoferritin is given in Fig . 6 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , again for 18 . 8 mg / ml , of fd . This result is obtained by averaging ten correlation functions collected during 90 s . The relative contribution of protein is typically A p = 0 . 80 – 0 . 95 . The solid line indicates the background con - tribution to the correlation function from pure fd , as plotted in Fig . 6 (cid:1) a (cid:2) . At least four of these results are averaged to give the ﬁnal values for diffusion coefﬁcients reported in the present paper to within an accuracy of about 10 % . 2 . Nematic suspensions In our experiments the director is perpendicular to the propagation direction of the laser beam , as depicted in Fig . 7 . Hence , motion parallel to the director occurs only along the smaller dimension (cid:24) 1 of the confocal volume , with the cor - responding diffusion coefﬁcient D s , (cid:18) . Motion perpendicular to the director occurs along the second smaller dimension and the larger dimension (cid:24) 2 of the confocal volume , with the corresponding diffusion coefﬁcient D s , (cid:1) . For diffusion of a tracer in a nematic suspension , the standard form (cid:1) 56 (cid:2) thus changes to C f 0 (cid:8) (cid:11) 1 + D s , (cid:18) t (cid:24) 12 (cid:13) −1 / 2 (cid:11) 1 + D s , (cid:1) t (cid:24) 12 (cid:13) −1 / 2 (cid:11) 1 + D s , (cid:1) t (cid:24) 22 (cid:13) −1 / 2 , (cid:1) 65 (cid:2) which is rewritten , analogous to its isotropic counterpart (cid:1) 62 (cid:2) as C f 0 (cid:1) t (cid:10) (cid:25) (cid:18) , (cid:25) (cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:8) (cid:11) 1 + t (cid:25) (cid:18) (cid:13) −1 / 2 (cid:11) 1 + t (cid:25) (cid:1) (cid:13) −1 / 2 (cid:11) 1 + 1 S 2 t (cid:25) (cid:1) (cid:13) −1 / 2 , (cid:1) 66 (cid:2) where the relaxation times are equal to (cid:25) (cid:1) = (cid:24) 12 / D s , (cid:1) and (cid:25) (cid:18) = (cid:24) 12 / D s , (cid:18) . (cid:1) 67 (cid:2) Both contributions to the correlation function for the impu - rity and the protein are given by this expression with the appropriate relaxation times (cid:25) i , (cid:1) , (cid:18) and (cid:25) p , (cid:1) , (cid:18) , respectively . The contribution of fd to the correlation function is found to be accurately described by the same function (cid:1) 62 (cid:2) as for isotropic suspensions . The fd contribution is thus charac - terized by two relaxation times (cid:25) 1 and (cid:25) 2 . Again , an interpre - tation of this representation of the correlation function of pure fd in terms of physically meaningful quantities would require a separate study . An example of a ﬁt is given in Fig . 8 (cid:1) a (cid:2) . Here the concentration of fd is 55 . 0 mg / ml , which is far above the concentration of the nematic - isotropic binodal (cid:1) which is located at about 22 mg / ml (cid:2) .

An experimental correlation function with a tracer amount of apoferritin is given in Fig . 8 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , together with the ﬁt to Eq . (cid:1) 63 (cid:2) with the appropriate nematic correlation func - tions as described above . The correlation function is the av - erage of ten measurements each collected during 90 s . The fd concentration here is 55 . 0 mg / ml . The solid line in Fig . 8 (cid:1) b (cid:2) indicates the background contribution from pure fd , as plot - ted in Fig . 8 (cid:1) a (cid:2) . The relative contribution of protein is typi - cally A p = 0 . 80 – 0 . 95 . Protein relaxation times are obtained in the same way as described in the previous subsection for isotropic suspensions . B . Diffusion coefﬁcients and screening lengths The experimental long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient of apoferritin , as obtained with FCS as a function of the fd - virus concentration is given in Fig . 9 . The vertical dashed area indicates the isotropic - nematic two - phase region . The solid lines are sigmoidal ﬁts to the data points . As can be seen , the diffusion coefﬁcient at the highest concentration in the isotropic fd network is in between the diffusion coefﬁ - cients for diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the director at the lowest concentration in the nematic network . Diffusion parallel to the director is faster than diffusion perpendicular to the director . The same trend has been found in Fig . 3 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , where the theoretical prediction for the numerical value of the coefﬁcient (cid:9) (cid:1) h is typically larger than (cid:9) (cid:18) h . The same holds for the corresponding shadowing coefﬁcients in Eq . (cid:1) 52 (cid:2) . As mentioned before , typical contributions due to shadowing ef - fect to the concentration dependence of the diffusion coefﬁ - cient are of the order of 1 % – 2 % , and are much smaller than the hydrodynamic contribution . Note that in the isotropic state , the mesh - size (cid:26) of the fd network can be obtained from 56 (cid:26) = L (cid:5) c (cid:1) / c , (cid:1) 68 (cid:2) where c is the concentration and c (cid:1) = 0 . 076 mg / ml is the overlap concentration of fd virus . Even for the highest con - centrations considered here , the mesh size is considerably larger than the diameter of the apoferritin tracer particles , which validates the approximations related to an open net - work made in the theory in Sec . II . The hydrodynamic screening length is now obtained from a comparison of the experimental data in Fig . 9 with the theoretical predictions in Eqs . (cid:1) 53 (cid:2) , (cid:1) 29 (cid:2) , and (cid:1) 52 (cid:2) . For each concentration of fd virus , the screening length is chosen such that the theoretical results for the diffusion coefﬁcient coincide with the experimental data . The solid lines in Fig . 10 thus correspond to the solid lines in Fig . 9 . The error bars in Fig . 10 are estimated errors in the screening length com - plying with the experimental error bars in Fig . 9 . The screen - ing length in the isotropic fd networks decreases with in - creasing fd concentration , as expected , and seems to level off to a constant at higher concentrations . For neniatic networks however , the screening length increases with increasing fd concentration . This counterintuitive result is due to the in - creasing degree of orientational order on increasing the fd concentration . Increasing the rod concentration and keeping the degree of orientational order ﬁxed would lead to a shorter screening length . Apparently , the increase of the screening length due to an increase in orientational order is stronger than its decrease due to an increase of concentration . This phenomenon is also exhibited by the shear viscosity of lyo - tropic nematics : the shear viscosity , on ﬁrst thought unex - pectedly , decreases on increasing the concentration of a nem - atic suspension due to the increase of orientational order (cid:1) see , for example , Refs . 57 and 58 (cid:2) . There is as yet no independent theory for the calculation of the hydrodynamic screening length . The self - consistent calculation of the screening length as given in Appendix C only works at low rod concentration but fails at higher con - centration . The probable reason for this failure is that the hydrodynamic ﬁeld that a rod experiences is not homoge - neous over its whole length . V . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION For diffusion of tracer spheres in networks of rods , there are two extreme cases to be distinguished , where either the diameter of the tracer sphere is large or small compared with FIG . 9 .

In the present paper we devel - oped a theory for diffusion of small tracer spheres in open networks of isotropic and nematic networks of rods . It is shown that for such relatively open networks hydrodynamic interactions are dominant over direct interactions (cid:1) the “shad - owing effect” (cid:2) . Furthermore , hydrodynamic interactions are screened due to entanglement of the rods in the network . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (cid:1) FCS (cid:2) has been used to probe the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient of ﬂuo - rescently labeled apoferritin in suspensions of fd virus , both in the isotropic and nematic state . A complication for the data analysis is that fd virus by itself ﬂuoresces to some extent . A careful background subtraction is necessary to extract the diffusion coefﬁcient of apoferritin in these mixtures . A cu - vette is designed in which a drop of nematic fd - virus suspen - sion is pinned in between two glass plates . It has been a nontrivial step in our experiments to ﬁnd a procedure to ﬁx a drop of suspension in between two glass plates . A mon - odomain nematic is prepared by an exposure of the drop to a magnetic ﬁeld before a FCS measurement . Combining the FCS data and the theory , the fd - concentration dependence of the hydrodynamic screening length is determined both in the isotropic state and in the nematic state for diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the director . As expected , the screening length decreases with increasing fd concentration in the isotropic state , that is , the penetration depth of a shear wave is less for a denser net - work . In the nematic state , however , the screening length increases with increasing concentration . This is due to the increase of orientational order as the concentration increases . Apparently , an increasing degree of orientational order strongly decreases hydrodynamic screening . A self - consistent calculation of the screening length predicts similar features , but is not accurate enough to compare with experi - ments on a semiquantitative level .

APPENDIX A : ON THE ACCURACY OF EQUATION „ 17 … There are two approximations involved in Eq . (cid:1) 17 (cid:2) : ﬁrst of all , the (cid:9) dependence in the bead - index sum in the ﬁrst term on the right - hand side of Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) is neglected , and secondly , the second term on the right - hand side in Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) is neglected against the ﬁrst term . The validity of the ﬁrst approximation is simply veriﬁed by calculating the bead - index sums , H 1 (cid:1) (cid:9) (cid:2) (cid:20) (cid:9) (cid:10) (cid:4) (cid:9) h 1 (cid:1) (cid:7) D (cid:10) (cid:9) − (cid:10) (cid:10)(cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:9) − (cid:10) (cid:10) , H 2 (cid:1) (cid:9) (cid:2) (cid:20) (cid:9) (cid:10) (cid:4) (cid:9) h 2 (cid:1) (cid:7) D (cid:10) (cid:9) − (cid:10) (cid:10)(cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:9) − (cid:10) (cid:10) , (cid:1) A1 (cid:2) as functions of (cid:9) for various (cid:1) small (cid:2) values of (cid:7) D , and com - pare the numerical values with H 1 (cid:1) (cid:9) = 0 (cid:2) and H 2 (cid:1) (cid:9) = 0 (cid:2) , re - spectively . The relative difference should be small for the majority of bead - index numbers (cid:9) . As can be seen from Fig . 11 , where both H 1 and H 2 are plotted as functions of (cid:9) for L / D = 51 and 101 , this is indeed the case . In calculating sums with respect to (cid:9) of functions that do not peak at the edges of the rod , the relative error is of the order of the difference in area under the solid curves and the corresponding straight line that marks the value of H 1 , 2 at (cid:9) = 0 . Sums of H 1 , 2 with respect to (cid:9) differ less than 8 % as compared with the area (cid:1) 2 m + 1 (cid:2) H 1 , 2 (cid:1) (cid:9) = 0 (cid:2) . Neglecting end effects thus introduces errors of the order of 10 % . Next consider the neglect of the second term in on the right - hand side in Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) with respect to the ﬁrst term . Note that it follows from Eq . (cid:1) 22 (cid:2) that , in the absence of hydro - dynamic screening , the bead forces F (cid:10) h typically vary like (cid:8) 1 / (cid:10) R / D − (cid:10) u ˆ (cid:10) . To estimate the accuracy of the neglect of the second term on the right - hand side of Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) we shall therefore compare the sum , FIG . 11 . The (cid:9) dependence of the sums H 1 (cid:3)(cid:1) a (cid:2) and (cid:1) c (cid:2)(cid:4) and H 2 (cid:3)(cid:1) b (cid:2) and (cid:1) d (cid:2)(cid:4) in Eq . (cid:1) A1 (cid:2) for L / D = 51 (cid:3)(cid:1) a (cid:2) and (cid:1) b (cid:2)(cid:4) and L / D = 101 (cid:3)(cid:1) c (cid:2) and (cid:1) d (cid:2)(cid:4) . The solid curves in all ﬁgures are from bottom to top for (cid:7) D = 1 / 10 , 1 / 20 , and 1 / 50 . The horizontal lines indicate the values at (cid:9) = 0 . 044907 - 14 Kang et al . J . Chem .

(cid:1) 16 (cid:2) . As can be seen from Fig . 12 , where W in Eqs . (cid:1) A2 (cid:2) (cid:1) solid lines (cid:2) and (cid:1) A3 (cid:2) (cid:1) dashed lines (cid:2) are plotted for various conﬁgurations of the tracer sphere relative to the rod , the relative error in neglecting the second term in Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) is good to within about 10 % – 20 % for the calculation of diffu - sion coefﬁcients : the bead - index number dependence is re - produced by the approximate form , and absolute differences are not too large even for close approach of the sphere to the rod . In addition , hydrodynamic screening will improve the accuracy of the approximation , since the “screening func - tions” h 1 , 2 (cid:1) (cid:7) D (cid:10) (cid:9) − (cid:10) (cid:10)(cid:2) in the screened Oseen tensor peak around neighboring beads . APPENDIX B : DERIVATION OF EQUATION „ 46 … Ensemble averages are calculated with respect to the probability function P (cid:1) r p (cid:2) = (cid:1) 1 / V (cid:2) g , where V is the total vol - ume of the system under consideration . Since the potential V = 0 for (cid:10) z (cid:10) (cid:18) 1 2 L + a , the ensemble average of the potential force is thus equal to (cid:14) (cid:3) V (cid:15) = (cid:12) d r p P (cid:3) V = (cid:5) ¯ (cid:12) − (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) L − a (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) L + a dz (cid:12) 0 (cid:19) d (cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:12) 0 2 (cid:8) d (cid:17) g (cid:1) (cid:5) , (cid:17) (cid:2) (cid:3) V (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) , (cid:1) B1 (cid:2) where as before (cid:5) ¯ = N / V is the number density of rods . The ensemble average for a single rod is multiplied here by the number of rods N to account for all rods in the system .

For hard - core interac - tions we have (cid:1) with (cid:22) the delta distribution (cid:2) exp (cid:6) − (cid:10) V (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2)(cid:7) dV (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) d (cid:5) = − (cid:10) −1 d exp (cid:6) − (cid:10) V (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2)(cid:7) d (cid:5) = − (cid:10) −1 (cid:22) (cid:1) (cid:5) − a − D / 2 (cid:2) . (cid:1) B4 (cid:2) Substitution into Eq . (cid:1) B3 (cid:2) thus gives (cid:10) (cid:14) (cid:3) V (cid:15) = (cid:10) F ext (cid:8)(cid:5) ¯L (cid:1) a + D / 2 (cid:2) 2 (cid:20) .

(cid:1) 46 (cid:2) . Similarly to Eq . (cid:1) B1 (cid:2) the ensemble average of the Brownian force is equal to (cid:14) (cid:3) ln (cid:6) g (cid:7)(cid:15) = (cid:12) d r p P (cid:3) ln (cid:6) g (cid:7) = (cid:5) ¯ (cid:12) − (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) L − a (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) L + a dz (cid:12) 0 (cid:19) d (cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:12) 0 2 (cid:8) d (cid:17) (cid:3) g (cid:1) (cid:5) , (cid:17) (cid:2) .

APPENDIX C : A SELF - CONSISTENT CALCULATION OF THE SCREENING LENGTH In this Appendix we shall calculate the friction coefﬁ - cient (cid:4) in Eq . (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) , which then identiﬁes the hydrodynamic screening length (cid:7) −1 through Eq . (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) . Since the network of the long and thin rods is very open , hydrodynamic interac - tions through ﬁelds that are multiply reﬂected by different rods towards the sphere are neglected . The friction coefﬁ - cient (cid:4) can thus be approximated as the friction coefﬁcient of a single rod in a Debye - Büche - Brinkman ﬂuid . FIG . 12 . The integral W in Eq .

Since the ﬂuid ﬂow u 0 in Eq . (cid:1) 15 (cid:2) is now a constant u , this “integral equation” reduces to F 3 (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 L + u + D L (cid:9) (cid:10) (cid:4) (cid:9) T s (cid:1) D u ˆ (cid:1) (cid:9) − (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:2) · F = 0 . (cid:1) C1 (cid:2) As in the previous subsection , end effects can be neglected for the long and thin rods under consideration and the bead - index sum can be rewritten as an integral . Analogous to Eq . (cid:1) 22 (cid:2) it is found that (cid:1) for convenience the screening length dependence of G and H are not denoted here explicitly (cid:2) F = − 2 (cid:8)(cid:6) 0 L G (cid:11) I ˆ − H G + H u ˆ u ˆ (cid:13) · u , (cid:1) C2 (cid:2) where G and H are deﬁned in Eq .

Here , it is assumed that for diffusion in the nematic state , the most important contributions originate from scattering where F is colinear to the velocity ﬁeld u . Furthermore , S is the largest eigenvalue of Q , the “scalar orientational order parameter , ” which measures the degree of orientational order . Equation (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) for the screening length in terms of the friction coefﬁcient thus leads to the following self - consistent relations , (cid:1) (cid:7) iso L (cid:2) 2 = 12 (cid:5) ¯ (cid:5) ¯ (cid:1) G iso + (cid:1) 2 / 3 (cid:2) H iso G iso (cid:3) G iso + H iso (cid:4) , (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:18) L (cid:2) 2 = 12 (cid:5) ¯ (cid:5) ¯ (cid:1) G (cid:18) + (cid:1) 2 / 3 (cid:2) H (cid:18) (cid:6) 1 + (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) S (cid:7) G (cid:18) (cid:3) G (cid:18) + H (cid:18) (cid:4) , (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) L (cid:2) 2 = 12 (cid:5) ¯ (cid:5) ¯ (cid:1) G (cid:1) + (cid:1) 2 / 3 (cid:2) H (cid:1) (cid:6) 1 − S (cid:7) G (cid:1) (cid:3) G (cid:1) + H (cid:1) (cid:4) , (cid:1) C5 (cid:2) where the index on (cid:7) again refers to the type of diffusion and where (cid:5) ¯ (cid:1) = 6 / (cid:1) (cid:8) L 3 (cid:2) (cid:1) C6 (cid:2) is the overlap concentration . For fd - virus suspensions the overlap concentration is 0 . 076 mg / ml . The binodals for the isotropic - nematic phase transition are located at 20 and 22 mg / ml , corresponding to (cid:5) ¯ / (cid:5) ¯ (cid:1) = 263 and 303 , respec - tively . The self - consistency relations (cid:1) C5 (cid:2) must be solved nu - merically . As can be seen from Fig . 13 and the experimental Fig . 10 , the numerical values of the self - consistently calcu - lated screening length agrees with the experiments only for very low concentration of fd virus . For higher concentrations in the isotropic state , the screening length becomes of the order of the diameter of fd virus , where the screening con - cept obviously breaks down . Furthermore , the screening lengths in the nematic state for diffusion perpendicular to the director are similarly of the order of the thickness of the rod , while for diffusion parallel to the director Eq . (cid:1) C5 (cid:2) has no solutions . It thus seems that a self - consistent calculation of the screening length does not work for the open network under consideration . The probable reason for this is that the hydrodynamic ﬁeld that a rod experiences is never homoge - neous over its whole length . A simple calculation of the fric - tion coefﬁcient of a rod in an otherwise quiescent (cid:1) screened (cid:2) ﬂuid is therefore unrealistic . 1 C . F . Schmidt , M . Bärmann , G . Isenberg , and E .
