ORIGINAL ARTICLE Dennis Hasselquist Æ James A . Marsh Paul W . Sherman Æ John C . Wingﬁeld Is avian humoral immunocompetence suppressed by testosterone ? Received : 13 April 1998 / Accepted after revision : 7 October 1998 Abstract A key issue in sexual selection theory is how a correlation between male secondary sexual characters and male genetic quality can be maintained . The im - munocompetence - handicap hypothesis proposes that testosterone - dependent male characters remain honest signals because of the immunosuppressive e(cid:128)ect of ele - vated steroid hormone levels . The hypothesis requires that physiological levels of testosterone depress immune system function . We quantiﬁed testosterone titers and humoral immunocompetence of captive male and female red - winged blackbirds ( Agelaius phoeniceus ) at three points in the annual cycle ( autumn , prebreeding , and breeding ) . We also conducted an implant experiment on the males to assess the e(cid:128)ects of prolonged , above - nor - mal testosterone titers on humoral immune responses . Humoral immunocompetence was measured as second - ary antibody production to a non - pathogenic protein antigen , keyhole limpet hemocyanin , using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay we developed for A . phoe - niceus . Secondary antibody responses of individuals were highly repeatable between sampling periods . Nei - ther physiological nor above - normal levels of plasma testosterone suppressed secondary antibody production . In paired tests of the same individuals between pre - breeding and breeding , and between breeding and im - plant , plasma testosterone increased signiﬁcantly but secondary antibody responses were una(cid:128)ected . We are conﬁdent in these results because with 80 % power , an 11 – 14 % di(cid:128)erence in antibody titers would have been detected . There was no relationship between plasma testosterone levels and humoral immunocompetence in free - ranging males tested at the peak of breeding . These results cast doubt on a key assumption of the immu - nocompetence - handicap hypothesis . Key words Immunocompetence Æ Testosterone Æ Immunosuppression Æ Sexual selection Æ Red - winged blackbird Æ ELISA Introduction Females of many animal species choose mates based on males’ secondary sexual characters ( reviewed by Andersson 1994 ) . In some species , o(cid:128)spring of males with the most elaborate characters ( e . g . , plumes , colors , and songs ) survive best , suggesting that these characters indicate male genetic quality ( Petrie 1994 ; von Schantz et al . 1994 ; Hasselquist et al . 1996 ) . A heavily debated question is what maintains the correlation between the expression of sexual characters and male quality ( e . g . , Kirkpatrick and Ryan 1991 ; Andersson 1994 ) . Simply put , why do low - quality males not ‘‘cheat’’ by expressing just the elaborate character ? Folstad and Karter ( 1992 ) proposed the immunocom - petence - handicap hypothesis ( ICH ) to address this issue . They suggested that the character - quality correlation is maintained by a ‘‘double - edged sword’’ e(cid:128)ect of testos - terone : higher titers enhance the expression of sexual characters , but they also depress immune system func - tions . Hence , testosterone - dependent characters honest - ly signal quality because only certain males can perform well with elevated steroid hormone levels . The ICH assumes that ( 1 ) physiological levels of testosterone suppress immune system functions , ( 2 ) males with more elaborate secondary sexual characters are preferred by females , and ( 3 ) males that secrete more Behav Ecol Sociobiol ( 1999 ) 45 : 167 – 175 (cid:211) Springer - Verlag 1999 D .

Assumption 2 is well supported by ﬁeld observations and experiments ( Andersson 1982 ; Møller 1988 ; von Schantz et al . 1989 ; Houde and Torio 1992 ; Zuk et al . 1992 ; Andersson 1994 ) . Assumption 3 has also received considerable support ( Wingﬁeld 1984 ; Borgia and Wingﬁeld 1991 ; Alatalo et al . 1996 ; Hillgarth and Wingﬁeld 1997 ; Raouf et al . 1997 ) , although , of course , not all secondary sexual characters require high levels of testosterone to develop fully ( Owens and Short 1995 ) . Information on the key assumption 1 of the ICH is contradictory . Whereas the initial studies concluded that testosterone indeed had immunosuppressive e(cid:128)ects ( re - viewed in Grossman 1984 ; Besedovsky and del Rey 1996 ) the evidence was not clear - cut . For example , much was made of the fact that females generally show stronger immune responses than males ( Grossman 1985 ; Alexander and Stimson 1988 ; Schuurs and Verheul 1990 ; Lin et al . 1996 ) . However , this does not prove that androgens , such as testosterone , are immunosuppres - sive , because stronger immune responses in females may be caused by their higher estrogen levels ( Olsen and Kovacs 1996 ) or by sex - speciﬁc di(cid:128)erences in immune responses based on other mechanisms . Other studies may be questioned because they involved testosterone supplementation that resulted in super - normal ( phar - macological ) androgen levels ( Mendelsohn et al . 1977 ; Novotny et al . 1983 ) . E(cid:128)ects of testosterone may di(cid:128)er with the developmental stage . In chickens , immuno - suppressive e(cid:128)ects occurred when testosterone was ad - ministred to chicks ( i . e . , during immune system development ) , but there were no such e(cid:128)ects in adult birds ( Gause and Marsh 1986 ; Schuurs et al . 1992 ) . Moreover , recent in vitro studies have not shown that testosterone consistently depresses immune functions ( reviewed in Marsh 1996 ) . In sum , recent reviews em - phasize that testosterone is a modulator that can both enhance and depress immune system functions ( Marsh 1996 ; Olsen and Kovacs 1996 ) . Six studies have attempted to test the ﬁrst assumption of the ICH in wild birds . Again results have been equivocal . Saino and Møller ( 1994 ) reported a negative relationship between testosterone levels and parasite load , which is consistent with the assumption . However , two other studies found no relationship between tes - tosterone levels and parasite loads ( Weatherhead et al . 1993 ) or lymphocyte counts ( Saino et al . 1995 ) . In cap - tive juvenile black - headed gulls ( Larus ridibundus ) , pri - mary antibody titers ( IgM ) averaged 31 % lower in testosterone - implanted birds than controls ( Ros et al . 1997 ) . This di(cid:128)erence was not signiﬁcant , so these au - thors argued that testosterone may not be immunosup - pressive . However , the statistical power of their test was very low . Finally , in two ﬁeld experiments , male birds were implanted with testosterone - ﬁlled capsules , result - ing in slightly higher testosterone levels than those that occur normally . In one of these studies lymphocyte counts decreased ( Zuk et al . 1995 ) , while in the other , total immunoglobulin levels decreased and the ectopar - asite load increased ( Saino et al . 1995 ) . These results were interpreted as supporting assumption 1 of the ICH . Most of these studies employed indirect measures of immune function ( e . g . , parasite loads , circulating im - mune cells ) , and the reliability of these methods has been questioned ( Lochmiller 1995 ; Siva - Jothy 1995 ) . A direct and more reliable measure of immunocompetence can be obtained by applying a method used in immunotoxicology in which humoral immune responses to speciﬁc novel antigens are measured with an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ( Fairbrother 1990 ; Lochmiller 1995 ) . We developed an ELISA spe - ciﬁc for red - winged blackbirds to investigate how nat - ural seasonal ﬂuctuations and experimental elevation in the birds’ serum testosterone levels a(cid:128)ected their hu - moral immune responses to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) . We used KLH because it is a non - pathogenic , harmless protein antigen that is highly immunogenic . Presumably red - winged blackbirds have never previ - ously been exposed to KLH ( see also Klein and Nelson 1997 ) . Red - winged blackbirds are good study subjects because testosterone is known to enhance male aggres - siveness and dominance ( Searcy and Wingﬁeld 1980 ) , and to be positively correlated with male song rate and epaulet exposure ( Johnsen 1998 ) , polygyny , and repro - ductive success ( Beletsky et al . 1989 , 1992 ) . Moreover , it is appropriate to measure humoral immunocompetence because studies of captive birds ( domesticated chicken ) indicate that this aspect of immune function is partic - ularly likely to be a(cid:128)ected if testosterone depresses immune activity ( reviewed in Schuurs and Verheul 1990 ; Marsh 1996 ) . Methods General methods We captured red - winged blackbirds near Seneca Falls , N . Y . , in September 1995 . Birds ( 13 males and 8 females ) were housed in a room with controlled light , temperature , and humidity at Cornell University until June 1996 , when they were released . Males and females were housed in individual cages in the same room . The light cycle approximated natural photoperiods throughout most of the year . Thus in October to December , we used the photoperiod for 36 (cid:176) N to mimic the situation at these birds’ presumed wintering areas . In January , we switched photoperiod to mimic conditions for Ithaca ( 42 (cid:176) N ) , and we also slightly advanced the light cycle so that the birds in February to late April experienced photoperiods that would occur naturally 2 – 3 weeks later in the season . During May , the light cycle was kept at natural photoperiods and in early June , the light cycle was slightly decreased ( 1 – 2 weeks ) so that the birds experienced late May photoperiods . We measured the males’ secondary antibody response to anti - gen challenge at four times : autumn ( October to December , when the males were not singing ) , prebreeding ( February , males had just started to sing ) , breeding ( April , males were singing intensively ) , and in a testosterone implant experiment ( May ) . Plasma testos - terone levels were monitored in each study period using a radio - immunoassay ( RIA ) . We also measured females’ secondary antibody responses against KLH during the autumn , prebreeding , and breeding periods . Monitoring humoral immune responses 168 enabled us to detect impairment in either T - or B - cell responsive - ness , because KLH is a T - cell - dependent antigen ( Rife et al . 1990 ) . In a separate experiment , we captured 16 territorial male red - winged blackbirds at the peak of the 1996 breeding season ( May ) , took a blood sample ( ca 300 l l ) , immunized each male with KLH , and within 30 min released each male back onto its own territory . We recaptured these males 8 – 13 days later ( i . e . , at the peak of their primary antibody responses ) , and took a blood sample ( ca 300 l l ) . We then quantiﬁed each male’s primary antibody production using our ELISA . Data were analyzed using SYSTAT 4 . 0 ( Wilkinson 1992 ) . Power tests were conducted in GPOWER ( Erdfelder et al . 1996 ) , and repeatability analyses followed procedures recom - mended by Lessells and Boag ( 1987 ) . Measuring serum testosterone Blood samples ( ca 300 l l ) were taken once in each of the four study periods ( captive birds ) and at ﬁrst capture ( wild birds ) . Plasma levels of testosterone were measured by a direct RIA conducted in J . C . Wingﬁeld’s laboratory using methods of Wingﬁeld and Farner ( 1975 ) and Ball and Wingﬁeld ( 1987 ) . All samples were measured in duplicate and in a single assay . Two standards of testosterone ( 250 pg / ml ) were included in the assay , and the mean value of these was 229 pg / ml ( intra - assay coe(cid:129)cient of variation = 6 . 3 % ) . In the study of captive birds , we obtained each set of blood samples within 10 min of entering the holding room except for the autumn period . Since plasma testosterone levels of wild song birds remain stable for at least 10 min after capture ( Wingﬁeld et al . 1982 ) , we are conﬁdent that androgen levels did not change artiﬁ - cially before sampling . In the autumn period , however , only 5 of 13 samples were taken within 10 min of entering the bird room ; the others were taken 15 – 90 min after entry . There was no signiﬁcant di(cid:128)erence in plasma testosterone levels between these two groups of birds ( t 16 = 0 . 66 , P = 0 . 58 ) ; all autumn samples contained very little or no testosterone independent of timing of sampling ( Table 1 ) . To capture wild males we placed traps baited with seeds on each male’s territory . Males were habituated to these traps for several weeks before capture . When a male was trapped , we immediately extracted it and obtained a blood sample within 5 – 10 min . Hence , plasma testosterone in the wild males should not have been artiﬁ - cially elevated due to the capture technique . Both in the ﬁeld ( Beletsky et al . 1989 ) and in captivity ( Kerlan and Ja(cid:128)e 1974 ) , plasma testosterone levels of individual male red - winged blackbirds are stable during the peak breeding period . To assess plasma testosterone stability in our birds , we compared eight males at di(cid:128)erent times within a given study period ( 6 – 54 days apart ) . Most samples were from the autumn and prebreeding peri - ods . We found either no or miniscule di(cid:128)erences in hormone levels between samplings ( i . e . , di(cid:128)erences ranged from 0 to 0 . 06 ng / ml ) . In the breeding period , our captive males sang intensively and they had higher testosterone levels than in the previous periods ( Table 1 ) even if the caged males’ average testosterone levels ( mean = 0 . 45 ng / ml , SE = 0 . 15 ) were lower than peak levels for wild males ( mean = 2 . 0 ng / ml , SE = 0 . 28 ) from the same popu - lation . Antigen injections Red - winged blackbirds were immunized using a preparation made by emulsifying 1 mg KLH / ml sterile H 2 O with 1 ml of incomplete Table 1 Secondary antibody production ( to keyhole limpet he - mocyanin ) and plasma testosterone levels of captive male and fe - male red - winged blackbirds measured in autumn ( October or December ) , the prebreeding season ( February ) , breeding season ( April ) , and in implanted males given testosterone implants in May .

Louis , Mo . ) . A total volume of 0 . 1 ml of this emulsion , containing 50 l g KLH , was injected into the breast muscle of each bird . We investigated the time course of primary and secondary antibody responses in four birds . Blood samples were taken before the priming immunization , every 3rd day after the ﬁrst injection ( day 6 – 21 ) , and on days 6 , 9 , 12 , and 14 after the second injection . We investigated humoral immune responses in captive red - winged blackbirds at three ( 8 females ) and four ( 13 males ) pe - riods . First we took a preimmunization blood sample from each of these birds . Thereafter , blood samples were taken on days 6 , 9 , and 12 after the second immunization in autumn , and on days 6 , 9 , and 12 after the booster immunization given in each of the prebreeding , breeding , and implant ( males only ) periods . Serum was separated by centrifugation , and stored at ) 50 (cid:176) C until analyses . We allowed the birds to adjust to captivity for 3 – 8 weeks in the fall of 1995 before experiments started . At the beginning of the autumn sampling period , each bird was given a priming immuni - zation with KLH that resulted in a primary immune response which peaked about 12 days after injection ( Fig . 1 ) . Three weeks after this ﬁrst injection , each bird was given a second KLH injec - tion . This resulted in a secondary immune response that peaked 6 – 9 days after the challenge , and which involved much higher levels of antibody production . In the prebreeding , breeding , and implant periods , each bird was given one booster injection of KLH that resulted in secondary antibody responses . Hence , in all four study periods , we measured the birds’ secondary antibody responses , which are characterized by a predominance of immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) . Two males and two females did not receive their ﬁrst and second injection until the prebreeding period . These served as contemporaneous controls . The rest of the caged birds were given their third KLH injection during the prebreeding period ( Table 1 ) . ELISA methods We measured anti - KLH antibody levels in the birds’ serum using an ELISA ( Exon and Talcott 1995 ) that we developed speciﬁcally for red - winged blackbirds . Basically , an ELISA works as follows . First , the sides of the wells of the ELISA plate are coated with antigen . In the present ELISA , we coated the wells with KLH , the antigen with which the birds were previously injected . Antigen that is not bound to the sides of the wells is then washed away . Next , test serum ( in our case from red - winged blackbirds ) is added to the wells , and the birds’ antigen - speciﬁc antibodies bind to the previ - ously bound antigen . Non - bound red - winged blackbird antibodies are then washed away . In the third step , rabbit anti - red - winged blackbird antibodies are added to the wells , and they bind specif - ically to the red - winged blackbird antibodies that are bound to the antigen on the sides of the wells . After washing , peroxidase - labelled antibodies ( e . g . , from sheep ) against rabbit antibodies are added , and they bind to the already - bound rabbit antibodies . Adding peroxide and substrate to the wells results in a color change that is proportional to the number of antigen - speciﬁc antibodies present in the test serum of each individual . The conditions of our speciﬁc ELISA were as follows . We in - cubated antisera in 96 - well ELISA plates coated with KLH . Plates were then blocked using a dilution of 3 % powdered milk in 0 . 01 M phosphate bu(cid:128)ered saline ( PBS , pH7 . 2 ) . A diluent of 1 % powdered milk in 0 . 01 M phosphate - bu(cid:128)ered saline ( PBS , pH 7 . 2 ) was used to produce 1 : 400 , 1 : 2000 and 1 : 8000 dilutions of each serum sam - ple . For each dilution and individual , serum samples were added to the plates in duplicate . The average of these was our measure of antibody titer for each individual . After incubation and wash ( in PBS and Tween 20 ) , we added a secondary rabbit anti - red - winged blackbird immunoglobulin antiserum which we had produced by immunizing rabbits with puriﬁed red - winged blackbird immuno - globulin M ( IgM ) and IgG . After a second incubation and wash , a commercial peroxidase - labelled goat anti - rabbit antiserum ( Kirkegard and Perry , Gaithersburg , Md . ) was added . Following incubation and wash , the peroxidase substrate ( 2 , 2 - azino - bis - 3 - ethylbenzthiazoline - 6 - sulfonic acid , ABTS ) and peroxide were added , and the plates were immediately transferred to a BioTek 312 EL ( Winooski , Vt . ) kinetics ELISA reader . Plates were read at 30 - s intervals for 16 min using a 405 - nm wavelength ﬁlter . All antibody concentrations are given as the slope of the substrate conversion over time measured in the units 10 ) 3 · optical density per minute ( mOD / min ) ( analyzed using KineticCalc software , Winooski ) , with a higher slope indicating a higher concentration of anti - KLH an - tibodies in a sample . For each individual , diluted serum samples taken 6 days after injection in each period were analyzed on the same ELISA plate , and samples from all individuals were analyzed on two ELISA plates run simultaneously in the same batch . In another batch of plates , we analyzed each individual’s serum samples taken at 9 days after injection in each period on the same ELISA plate , and sam - ples from all individuals were all included on two plates that were run simultaneously . For each study period , we used the average antibody titer for day 6 and day 9 after injection as the measure of an individual’s peak secondary antibody production ( see Fig . 1 ) . No antibody production against KLH was detected in ( autumn ) preimmunization samples from any of the birds . Serum samples diluted 1 : 8000 were used in all analyses because this dilution pro - vided optimal analysis conditions . There was a high repeatability of each individual’s duplicate samples run on the same ELISA plate ( samples taken day 6 after injection : repeatability in autumn R = 0 . 82 , prebreeding R = 0 . 91 , breeding R = 0 . 96 , and im - planted R = 0 . 98 , ANOVA P < 0 . 001 for all periods ) . There was also high repeatability between the same individual’s samples taken on days 6 and 9 , although these samples were taken at di(cid:128)erent times during the antibody response and analysed on di(cid:128)erent ELISA plates run on di(cid:128)erent dates ( repeatability and ANOVA P - value for samples in : autumn R = 0 . 36 , P = 0 . 06 ; prebreeding R = 0 . 63 , P = 0 . 001 ; breeding R = 0 . 55 , P = 0 . 003 , and im - planted R = 0 . 64 , P = 0 . 004 ) . Testosterone implant experiment A small Silastic tube ( inner diameter = 1 . 47 mm , outer diame - ter = 1 . 95 mm ; Dow Corning ) was ﬁlled with testosterone propi - onate ( T - 1875 , Sigma ) , sealed with Medical Adhesive Silicone ( Dow Corning ) , and implanted between the skin and the breast muscle of all 13 males in May . Tubes were 15 or 25 mm long . These Fig . 1 Mean ( (cid:139)SE ) primary and secondary antibody production ( measured in 10 ) 3 · optical density per minute ; mOD / min ) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH , a harmless protein antigen ) in four red - winged blackbirds . A ﬁrst injection with KLH ( mixed with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant ) was given at day 1 , and a second injection after 3 weeks . Antibody production was measured every 3rd day 170 were randomly assigned to males to create a range of high testos - terone levels . These males experienced 3 . 3 – 31 . 2 ng testosterone / ml serum , which is 20 – 30 times higher than these individuals’ peak testosterone titers during the breeding period ( Table 1 ) . Of our implanted males , 69 – 77 % had higher plasma testosterone levels than the maximum plasma testosterone levels at the peak of breeding in wild male red - winged blackbirds [ approximately 7 ng / ml in Ithaca , 9 ng / ml in Indiana ( Johnsen 1998 ) and 10 ng / ml in Washington ( Beletsky et al . 1989 ) ] . The RIA technique we used , besides detecting the testosterone that is produced naturally by the birds , only detects the testosterone that is metabolized from the implanted testosterone propionate , so the plasma androgen levels measured in this experiment may have been even higher . Results We ﬁrst investigated the timing and relative magnitude of primary and secondary antibody production to KLH in red - winged blackbirds . Using our ELISA , we ob - tained measures of mean ( (cid:139)SE ) antibody titers in serum samples taken from males every 3rd day ( Fig . 1 ) . The primary immune response peaked around day 12 after the ﬁrst antigen injection . Thereafter , antibody titers decreased slowly until day 21 . The second antigen in - jection was given 22 days after the ﬁrst , and the birds’ secondary immune response peaked 6 – 9 days later . Figure 1 shows that the peak level of the secondary immune response was 3 – 4 times higher than the primary immune response peak . Each individual’s secondary humoral immune responses was highly repeatable over the three to four periods they were sampled ( R = 0 . 51 , F 21 , 54 = 4 . 7 , P < 0 . 0001 ) , indicative of consistent dif - ferences in immune responses between individual male and female red - winged blackbirds . There was a signiﬁcant increase in the captive males’ secondary humoral immune responses between the au - tumn and prebreeding periods ( paired t - test , P = 0 . 003 ) , when plasma testosterone increased slightly ( Table 1 ) . However , secondary antibody responses did not diminish either between the prebreeding and breed - ing samples ( paired t - test , P = 0 . 85 ) , when plasma tes - tosterone levels increased naturally about ninefold , nor between breeding and implant samples when testoster - one levels were artiﬁcially increased 20 – 30 times ( paired t - test , P = 0 . 14 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . The statistical power of these results is high : with 80 % power we should have detected an 11 – 14 % di(cid:128)erence in antibody titers between periods at the P = 0 . 05 level ( two - tailed test ) . For the implant period , we also analyzed our data using a repeated - measures ANOVA with plasma testosterone and implant size as independent variables and antibody production as the dependent variable . Neither plasma testosterone ( P = 0 . 66 ) nor implant size ( P = 0 . 40 ) showed any relationship with antibody production . We also analyzed whether humoral immunosuppres - sion occurred at above - normal levels of testosterone as a result of the implant experiment ( Fig . 3 ) . We found no correlation between the captive males’ change in tes - tosterone levels and their change in antibody production caused by the implant experiment ( r = ) 0 . 19 , P = 0 . 54 ) . The same was true when we included change in testosterone ( partial r = ) 0 . 15 , P = 0 . 65 ) and im - plant size ( partial r = 0 . 28 , P = 0 . 40 ) as predictors of change in antibody production in a multiple regression . Among wild territory - holding males , there was no signiﬁcant relationship between testosterone and pri - mary antibody response to a single injection of KLH ( r = ) 0 . 20 , P = 0 . 46 , n = 16 ; Fig . 4 ) . This was also true when we controlled for the time period between injection and sampling in a multiple regression analysis ( F = 0 . 28 , P = 0 . 76 , n = 16 ; time to sampling , partial r = 0 . 044 , P = 0 . 88 ; testosterone titer , partial r = ) 0 . 15 , P = 0 . 58 ) . If testosterone is immunosuppressive , the captive males and females should have exhibited similar anti - body responses in autumn , but males should have ex - hibited lower responses than females in the prebreeding and breeding periods as a result of elevation in males’ plasma testosterone levels . In a repeated - measures Fig . 2 Mean ( (cid:139)SE ) secondary antibody production ( mOD / min ) of captive male and female red - winged blackbirds against KLH at several times over the annual cycle : in autumn , the wintering period when males produced no testosterone ; prebreeding , in February when males naturally produced low testosterone levels ; breeding , in April when males naturally produced medium testosterone levels ; implant ( males only ) , in May when males were implanted with Silastic tubes containing testosterone propionate , which resulted in high - normal to above - normal testosterone levels . The males’ mean plasma testoster - one ( ng / ml ) in each period is given across the top 171 ANOVA including only the individuals sampled in all three periods , humoral immune responses of females ( n = 6 ) were generally higher than males ( n = 11 ) ( sex , F = 4 . 2 , P = 0 . 06 ) , even in autumn when plasma tes - tosterone titers in males were undetectable ( Table 1 ) . Immune responses against KLH increased from autumn to breeding ( period , F = 18 . 1 , P < 0 . 001 ) , but there was no interaction between sex and period ( F = 0 . 13 , P = 0 . 87 ) . Thus from autumn to breeding , female hu - moral immune responses were consistently higher than in males , despite increases in male testosterone levels between these periods ( Fig . 2 , Table 1 ) . Discussion Although our study is based on relatively small sample sizes , our approach of repeatedly measuring the same males’ secondary humoral immune responses at four di(cid:128)erent periods , with successively elevated plasma tes - tosterone titers allowed us to use powerful statistics . The power of our paired t - tests was so high that we can conﬁdently conclude that testosterone did not have any suppressive e(cid:128)ect on secondary humoral immune re - sponses in our captive males . We also found no corre - lation between primary humoral immune responses and endogenous testosterone levels in the wild males . This test , however , has lower statistical power . There was a weak and non - signiﬁcant negative correlation between primary humoral immunocompetence and plasma tes - tosterone in these males . It might be worth reinvesti - gating this relationship with a larger sample of wild males . In red - winged blackbirds , primary antibody re - sponses against KLH peaked at approximately 12 days after the ﬁrst injection , and secondary antibody re - sponses at 6 – 9 days after the second injection ( Fig . 1 ) . The slow decrease in antibody titers after the peak of the primary response is most likely due to the adjuvant . We immunized KLH mixed with incomplete Freund’s ad - juvant which resulted in a slow release of antigen over a few weeks ( Fig . 1 ) . This mimicked a real infection in which the pathogen continuously reproduces and its antigens are therefore present in the host’s blood for days or weeks . When immunocompetence is measured using a single immunization of antigen without adju - vant , the results may be less easily related to a real in - fection ( Westneat and Birkhead 1998 ) . There was a high repeatability of secondary antibody responses to KLH over the four study periods , which support the use of this technique as a sensitive and quantitative measure of humoral immunocompetence . This result also shows that measuring humoral immu - nocompetence as antibody production against KLH revealed some individual di(cid:128)erences in the birds’ abilities to mount humoral immune responses . These di(cid:128)erences may result from individual di(cid:128)erences in ( 1 ) MHC molecule repertoire and thus ability to recognize di(cid:128)er - ent antigens ( e . g . , Briles et al . 1977 ; Lamont et al . 1987 ) , and ( 2 ) abilities to produce a strong immune response subsequent to the antigen recognition process ( e . g . , Wakelin and Apanius 1997 ; Westneat and Birkhead 1998 ) . We do not know to what extent these factors contributed to the magnitude of the humoral immune responses we observed , even though it is generally thought that both these processes are important for an acquired immune response . However , by challenging individuals repeatedly when their testosterone levels di(cid:128)ered we should have been able to detect any immu - nosuppressive e(cid:128)ect of testosterone independent of which of the two mechanisms was the most important . A weakness in the design of the testosterone implant experiment is that there was no control group of males that did not receive implants . Hence , it is possible that humoral immune responses of males did not decrease when testosterone levels increased because heightened responses to the booster injections of KLH masked the Fig . 3 Relationship between the change in plasma testosterone levels ( ng / ml ) and the change in secondary antibody production ( mOD / min ) against KLH as a result of a testosterone propionate implant experiment in captive male red - winged blackbirds Fig . 4 Relationship between plasma testosterone levels ( ng / ml ) and primary antibody production ( mOD / min ) against KLH in a population of wild male red - winged blackbirds at the peak of the breeding season ( in May when testosterone levels were at their peak ) 172 suppression . However , this seems unlikely for three reasons . First , e(cid:128)ects of testosterone on immune re - sponses of all captive birds were assessed following a secondary antibody stimulation , that is , when memory B - cells for the antigen ( KLH ) had already been formed . Second , the temporal pattern of females’ antibody re - sponses were similar to those of males : female responses also increased signiﬁcantly between autumn and pre - breeding samples ( P = 0 . 04 ) but not between pre - breeding and breeding samples ( P = 0 . 35 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . In the latter comparison , the 4 % increase in antibody titers between periods ( Table 1 ) suggests that there is little or no e(cid:128)ect of increasing secondary antibody responses to repeated KLH injections ( after the ﬁrst injection ) . Third , the four birds that received their second immunization with KLH in the prebreeding period had similar ( indeed , slightly higher ) antibody titers as the 16 birds that re - ceived their third KLH immunization in the prebreeding period ( ANOVA : sex , F = 4 . 5 , P = 0 . 05 ; number of injections , F = 2 . 0 , P = 0 . 17 ) . Production of the stress hormone corticosterone also might result in decreased immunocompetence ( Sapolsky 1993 ; Møller 1995 ; Besedovsky and del Rey 1996 ; Hill - garth and Wingﬁeld 1997 ) . We did not measure corti - costerone directly . However , if corticosterone a(cid:128)ected humoral immunocompetence in our experiments , we would have expected di(cid:128)erences between birds investi - gated at the beginning of the autumn period ( October ) , when they had not yet fully adjusted to captivity , and the end of the autumn period ( December ) when their ad - justment was presumably more complete . There were , however , no signiﬁcant di(cid:128)erences between the begin - ning and the end of the autumn period in the captive males’ humoral immune responses ( t 10 = 0 . 24 , P = 0 . 82 ) or plasma testosterone levels ( t 18 = 0 . 86 , P = 0 . 40 ) . Apparently , the birds adjusted to captivity and handling during the weeks preceding their ﬁrst KLH injection . Captive female red - winged blackbirds had greater humoral immune responses than males , even though male testosterone levels increased from nil in autumn to high in breeding . In general , female vertebrates have greater immune responses than males ( e . g . , Terres et al . 1968 ; Grossman 1984 ) , and it has been suggested that this is a consequence of the immunosuppressive e(cid:128)ect of testosterone in males ( Alexander and Stimson 1988 ; Schuurs and Verheul 1990 ) . However , detailed studies of sex di(cid:128)erences in immune system function imply that humoral immune response are enhanced in females rather than depressed in males ( Grossman 1985 ; Talal 1989 ; Wiedmeier et al . 1991 ; Olsen and Kovacs 1996 ) . Hence , the greater humoral responses of red - winged blackbird females probably resulted from their enhanced antibody production rather than from testosterone - in - duced suppression in males . It should be noted that we investigated humoral im - mune responses , which are part of the acquired immune system . We cannot exclude the possibility that the other parts of the immune system , i . e . , the innate immune system and the cell - mediated part of acquired immune responses , were negatively a(cid:128)ected by testosterone . We measured humoral immune responses for the following reasons . ( 1 ) Based on in vitro studies at the cellular level , the humoral part of the immune system seems particu - larly likely to be suppressed by testosterone ( e . g . , Sthoeger et al . 1988 ; Araneo et al . 1990 ; Olsen and Kovacs 1996 ) . ( 2 ) In chicken , treatment with testoster - one results in lower antibody production , probably due to an inability to switch from IgM - type to IgG - type responses ( Hirota et al . 1980 ; Verheul et al . 1986 ) . ( 3 ) Methods providing sensitive measures of innate and cell - mediated immunity are in most cases based on species - speciﬁc in vitro methods and involve killing the study animals ( e . g . , Fairbrother 1990 ; Luster et al . 1992 ; Di - etert et al . 1996 ) . Hence , our measure of immunocom - petence based on measuring humoral immune responses in vivo should have detected possible immunosuppressive e(cid:128)ects of testosterone . However , we did not ﬁnd any evidence that testos - terone suppresses humoral immune responses in male red - winged blackbirds . Physiological testosterone levels , i . e . , levels that under natural conditions can a(cid:128)ect the expression of sexually selected characteristics , exerted no consistent e(cid:128)ect on either primary or secondary humoral immune responses . This was true both for wild males held in captivity and sampled repeatedly from autumn through breeding , in testosterone - implanted males , and in wild males investigated at the peak of breeding . This implies that males’ antibody production against chronic and regularly encountered pathogens would be relatively una(cid:128)ected by cyclic changes in testosterone . Our study thus o(cid:128)ers no support for Folstad and Karter’s ( 1992 ) hypothesis that immunosuppression by testosterone serves as the mechanism by which testosterone - mediated characters remain honest signals of male quality . Recently , it has been suggested that the trade - o(cid:128) between sexual ornaments and the immune system can arise via other mechanisms , for example energy or nu - trient limitations ( Wedekind and Folstad 1994 ) , stress ( glucocorticoid hormones : Møller 1995 ; Siva - Jothy 1995 ; Hillgarth and Wingﬁeld 1997 ) , or production and biotransformation of free - radicals ( von Schantz et al . 1999 ) . These alternative mechanisms now deserve more attention in order to elucidate the possible relationship between sexual ornaments and the immune system . Acknowledgements We thank C . Brown , A .
