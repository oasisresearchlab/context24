McMahon 1 Endocytosis is required for internalization of micronutrients and turnover of membrane components . Endophilin has been assigned as a component of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Here we show in mammalian cells that endophilin marks and controls a fast - acting tubulovesicular endocytic pathway that is independent of AP2 and clathrin , activated upon ligand binding to cargo receptors , inhibited by inhibitors of dynamin , Rac , phosphatidylinositol - 3 - OH kinase , PAK1 and actin polymerization , and activated upon Cdc42 inhibition . This pathway is prominent at the leading edges of cells where phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 - bisphosphate—produced by the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate by SHIP1 and SHIP2—recruits lamellipodin , which in turn engages endophilin . This pathway mediates the ligand - triggereduptake ofseveral G - protein - coupled receptorssuchas a 2a - and b 1 - adrenergic , dopaminergic D3 and D4 receptors and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 , the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR , HGFR , VEGFR , PDGFR , NGFR andIGF1R , aswellasinterleukin - 2receptor . Wecallthisnewendocyticroutefastendophilin - mediatedendocytosis ( FEME ) . TheBAR ( Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ) - domain - containingproteinendophilin - A ( hereafter called endophilin ) is an endocytic protein that recruits dynamin and synaptojanin 1 , and the disruption of which has a pro - found effect on endocytosis in mice , nematodes and flies 2 – 5 . Evidence for its involvement in clathrin - mediated endocytosis came from BAR domain and antibody injection experiments in lamprey synapses , re - sulting in an accumulation of early - and late - stage clathrin - coated pits and a corresponding decrease in the number of synaptic vesicles 6 – 9 . Furthermore , endophilin has been detected on clathrin - coated pits by immuno - electronmicroscopyandfluorescencemicroscopy 5 , 9 – 12 . How - ever , several lines of evidence suggest a peripheral role for endophilin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis : it was only detected in one - quarter offormingclathrin - coatedpits 10 , 12 ; tripleknockdown ( TKD ) ofallthree endophilin - A proteins ( A1 , A2 and A3 ) by RNA interference ( RNAi ) does not affect the uptake of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis cargo transferrin 13 ; and the kinetics of synaptic vesicle retrieval in goldfish bipolarneuronsinhibitedbyendophilinN - BARdomaininjection ( BAR domainwithitsamino - terminalamphipathichelixextensions ) wasdis - tinct from that inhibited by a peptide inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis 14 , 15 . Interestingly , endophilinbindsdirectlytoaproline - rich motif present in the third intracellular loop ( TIL ) of the b 1 - adrenergic receptor ( b 1 - AR ) but not the b 2 - AR ( ref . 16 ) , both being members of the G - protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) superfamily . Endophilin also binds to EGFR and HGFR through CIN85 and Cbl ( refs 17 , 18 ) . Here we reveal that endophilin is not simply a peripheral component of clathrin - mediated endocytosis but principally marks and controls a distinct endocytic pathway . Endophilin - dependent endocytosis of GPCR Lookingforcargoesthat canbindtothe SH3domainof endophilin , we found that in addition to b 1 - AR , endophilin bound strongly to discrete proline - rich motifs within the TIL of the a 2a - AR , dopaminergic recep - tors3and4 ( DR3andDR4 ) andtothemuscarinicacetylcholinereceptor4 ( mAchR4 ) , and weakly to the histaminergic receptors 1 and 3 but not totheothermembersoftheamineGPCRsub - familytested ( Fig . 1aand ExtendedDataFig . 1a – e ) . Theinternalizationof b 1 - ARinanantibody - feeding assay was strongly decreased in endophilin TKD but not in clathrin or AP2 - depleted cells , suggesting an endocytic route indepen - dent of clathrin - mediated - endocytosis ( Fig . 1b ) . Among the five endo - philingenes , A2 wasthemostimportantinBSC1cells , followedby A1 , with little or no role for A3 , B1 and B2 . The uptake of b 1 - AR required full - length A2 and its N - BAR or SH3 domains could not rescue the endophilinTKD ( Fig . 1b ) . Consistentwiththebindingdata , onlyinter - nalization of b 1 - AR and a 2a - AR , DR3 , DR4 , and mAchR4 was signifi - cantly reduced in endophilin TKD cells ( Extended Data Fig . 1m , n ) . These endocytic defects were only observed after ligand stimulation , implicatingendophilininreceptor - mediatedendocytosisinitiatedupon receptor activation by their ligands . Endophilin TKD cells showed un - perturbed uptake of transferrin and LDL receptors ( cargo for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) , but clathrin - coated pits formed at a slightly slowerrate ( Extended Data Fig . 1f – i ) , perhaps related toa reduced syn - aptojanin recruitmentto membranesandthus an increase in phospha - tidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) levels 5 , 19 . Surface b 1 - AR accumulatedmostlyattheleadingedgeofendophilinTKDcells , which coincidedwiththelocalizationofmostoftheendophilinsignalincontrolcells ( Fig . 1c , ExtendedDataFigs1j – land2andSupplementaryVideo1 ) . Consistentwiththevirtualabsenceofclathrin - coatedpitsandvesiclesat theleadingedge ( ExtendedDataFig . 2e ) , endogenousendophilinshowed little co - localization with AP2 ( 2 6 0 . 1 % of endogenous AP2 spots ) , much lower than observed for endophilin overexpression data ( , 5 % on snapshot confocal images and a brief flash just before budding in , 25 % ofrecordedclathrin - coatedvesiclebuddingkymographs , inagree - ment with previous studies 10 , 12 ) .

Asthedeple - tionofthelatterdidnotaffectendophilinsignalsorinternalizationofthefiveGPCRsidentified , it suggested a hitherto novel endocytic process . Very shortly ( t 1 / 2 5 7 s ) after addition of b 1 - AR but not b 2 - AR ag - onists , numerous endophilin – RFP - positive assemblies ( EPAs ) ema - nated from the cell edges and rapidly ( 1 . 62 6 0 . 29 m m s 2 1 ) travelled to the perinuclear area ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Video 3 ) . The formation of intracellular tubules and vesicles positive for endogenous endophilin after b 1 - AR - specific activation was con - firmed by confocal and electron microscopy ( Fig . 1e – g and Extended Data Fig . 4c – o ) . EPAs were quantified on middle confocal planes and the vesicles / tubules formed were probably detached as they were no longer accessible to externally applied dyes . Consistentlywiththeabsenceofco - localization , EPAformationwas unaffectedbytheinhibitionofclathrin - mediatedendocytosisbyAP180 carboxy terminus overexpression or by RNAi of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis components clathrin heavy chain or AP2 ( Extended Data Fig . 4g and j ) . As expected from the binding data , only the overexpres - sion of TILs from the receptors that bound to endophilin perturbed EPA formation ( Extended Data Fig . 5a , b ) . EPAs formed upon b 1 - AR activationwereconfirmedasauthenticendocyticcarriersbecauseinthe antibody - feeding assay they contained anti - HA antibodies ( Fig . 1g ) . Finally , signal transduction downstream of b 1 - AR ( cAMP production and PKA - mediated CREB phosphorylation ) was elevated in endophi - lin TKD cells ( Fig . 1h and Extended Data Fig . 5c , d ) , suggesting that EPAs mediate the downregulation of activated b 1 - AR . Even though b - arrestin , akeyclathrin - mediatedendocytosisadaptorfor b 2 - AR , was locatedattheedgeofcells , itwasnotdetectedonEPAs , nordiditsover - expressionordepletionperturbEPAformationafter b 1 - ARstimulation ( Extended Data Fig . 5e – h ) .

Receptor - tyrosine kinase uptake by FEME As removal of serum ( hence of growth factors ) from the culture me - dium or addition of extra serum strongly decreased or increased , re - spectively , the formation of EPAs ( Fig . 2a ) , we assessed the capacity of various growth factors to activate FEME . Addition of EGF , HGF , FGF , VEGF , PDGF , NGF and IGF - 1 but not TGF - b or BMP2 induced the formation of EPAs in three different cell lines , including primary fibroblasts from adult donors ( Fig . 2a – c , Extended Data Fig . 6a – d and SupplementaryVideo4 ) .

Consistent with the binding of endophilin to EGFR and HGFR throughCIN85andCbl ( refs17 , 18 ) , depletionofCIN85orCbl , orover - expression of a mutant form of CIN85 ( which binds Cbl but not endo - philin ) , inhibited EPA formation upon EGF or HGF stimulation but not b 1 - AR stimulation ( Extended Data Fig . 6f ) . EGFR , similarly to b 1 - AR , accumulated at the plasma membrane of endophilin TKD cells ( Fig . 2f ) , which resulted in elevated downstream MAPK signalling during the first 10 min of stimulation ( Fig . 2g and Extended Data Fig . 7a – g ) , indicating that endophilin was necessary for maintaining a low basal activation state . We found that concentrations of EGF over 5 ng ml 2 1 were required for full stimulation of EPAs ( Fig . 2b ) , consistent with dynamin - dependent , clathrin - independentendocyticpathway ( s ) downregulating EGFR signalling at these concentrations 23 ( clathrin - mediated endocy - tosiscanfunctionat # 2ngml 2 1 EGFconcentrations ) . However , MAPK signalling was downregulated in endophilin TKD cells upon 30 min of high ( 100ng ml 2 1 ) EGFstimulation ( ExtendedDataFigs6g – jand7c ) , indicating that another endocytic process , probably macropinocyto - sis , isthenmediatingEGFRuptake . Notably , FEMEcarriersandmacro - pinocytosis co - exist but are morphologically distinct—small , , 1 m m , tubules and vesicles compared with large ( 2 – 10 m m ) ruffles and pino - somes ( Extended Data Fig . 6k ) . The very prompt budding of endocytic vesicles following receptor stimulation and the enrichment of endophilin at the leading edge sug - gests that FEME might be involved in directed cell migration . Simi - larly toEPA formation , migrationofendophilin TKD cellswas strongly decreased in an EGFR - dependent , but RAF - and MEK - independent , manner ( Fig . 2h and Extended Data Fig . 7h ) , suggesting separate func - tions for FEME in MAPK signalling and cell migration downstream of EGFR . Finally , consistent with the decrease in NGFR uptake , neurite extensioninresponsetoNGFwasstronglyinhibitedinendophilinTKDPC12cells ( Extended Data Fig . 7i – k ) , consolidating a role for FEME in growth - factor signalling and cell migration . IL - 2 receptor endocytosis by FEME Wenextinvestigatedwhichknownclathrin - independentcargoes could use the FEME pathway to enter cells . The b - chain of the interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R b ) and the common cytokine c - chain ( IL - 2R c c ) are known to use a clathrin - independent endocytic route 24 , 25 . The IL - 2 receptor ( composed of the IL - 2R a , b and c c chains ) assembles upon bindingtoIL - 2 , triggeringasignaltransductioncascadeleadingtolym - phocyteproliferationandimmuneresponses . After additionof200pM IL - 2 together with an antibody specific to the extracellular domain of IL - 2R , numerousEPAscontaininginternalizedantibodieswereobserved in a human T - cell line ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Upon addition of IL - 2 , endophilin puncta were observed at the edges of cells , followed by numerous in - ternal EPAs ( Extended Data Fig . 8a , b ) . However , we did not detect significant co - localization of endophilin with 16 transmembrane and glycophosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored receptors of the cluster of designation ( CD ) superfamily known to be internalized by clathrin - independentmechanisms 26 ( Fig . 3a ) . Consistently , endophilinTKDonly decreased the endocytic rate of IL - 2R but not that of the other recep - tors ( Fig . 3c ) . Together , this demonstrated that the FEME pathway mediates the uptake of IL - 2 - triggered IL - 2R but that not all clathrin - independent cargo use this internalization pathway . Inhibitors of the FEME pathway Inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis using five different gen - etic approaches ( RNAi of key components or overexpression of dom - inant - negative mutants ) did not interfere with EPA production upon stimulation ( Fig . 4a ) , further confirming that the FEME pathway acts as a clathrin - independentendocyticroute . However , we found that the differentchemicalmeanstoinhibitclathrin - mediatedendocytosiswidely used in the literature ( hypertonic shock , K 1 depletion , monodansyl - cadaverine , chlorpromazine and phenylarsine oxide ) all strongly inhi - bited EPA formation , suggesting pleiotropic effects of these inhibitors A n t i - e n d o p h ili n a A c t i n A n t i - e n d o - Serum + Serum Resting Middle plane c + EGF R e s t i n g T f E G F H G F F G F VE G F P D G F N G F I G F 1 B M P 2 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 BSC1 RPE1 T G F β N u m b e r o f E PA s p e r 400 μ m 2 b 1 10 100 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 EGF ( ng ml – 1 ) 500 N u m b e r o f E PA s p e r 400 μ m 2 g 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 1 2 3 4 Time after EGF ( min ) P h o s p h o - E R K Control Endo TKD AP2 siRNA * * * * * * e + EGF ( 4 min ) I n t e r n .

Dynamin is probably the main driver of membrane scission in the FEME pathway , as overexpressing dominant - negative mutants K44A and T65A , depleting its levels by RNAi or inhibiting its function using five different small inhibitors including dynasore and dyngo - 4a abro - gated EPA budding ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 8c ) . Perturbing actinpolymerizationwithcytochalasinD , latrunculinA , jasplakinolide or Arp2 / 3 inhibitors blocked EPA formation , even at a concentration thatdid not block clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Fig . 4b and Extended Data Figs 8f , g and 9a ) . Perturbation of Rho and of Rac blocked the pathway , consistent with their known inhibition of IL - 2R b uptake 24 , 27 . Surprisingly , inhibition of Cdc42 increased EPA formation ( Fig . 4b , Extended Data Fig . 8f and Supplementary Video 5 ) . All known inhi - bitorsofclathrin - independentendocytosis / macropinocytosistestedalso inhibitedtheFEME pathway ( Fig . 4c ) . However , overexpression of the BAR domain of endophilin lacking its N - terminal amphipathic helix ( D H0 - BAR ) was a good inhibitor of the pathway ( Fig . 4c , d and Ex - tended Data Fig . 8d , e ) , suggesting a specific way to inhibit the path - way . Itactsbyheterodimerizingwithendogenousendophilin , andthus decreasing its recruitment to the membrane . Interestingly , many inhi - bitors acted very promptly ( seconds ) on endophilin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( Extended Data Fig . 8g ) . Key inhibitors of EPA for - mation also inhibited FEME cargo uptake but not transferrin uptake and perturbed directed cell migration ( Extended Data Fig . 9a , b ) . Alto - gether , this established FEME as a clathrin - independent but dynamin - , cholesterol - , actin - , Rac - , Rho - , phosphatidylinositol - 3 - OH kinase ( P ( I ) 3K ) - and PAK1 - dependent endocytic pathway . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is required for FEME The prominence of endophilin signals at the leading edge of migrating cells ( also called the lamellipodium ) and its inhibition by class I PI ( 3 ) K inhibitors suggested a role for phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) , as it is produced from the phosphorylation of phos - phatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) byclassIPI ( 3 ) Kupon receptor activation and is enriched at the leading edge 28 , 29 . Once gen - erated , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is rapidly hydrolysed back into PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by the 3 9 - phosphatase PTEN ( Fig . 5a and ref . 30 ) . As expected , genetic orchemicalinhibitionofPTEN significantlyincreasedthe recruitment of endophilinattheleading edge in a class I PI ( 3 ) K - dependent manner ( Fig . 5b , c and Extended Data Fig . 9c ) . Surprisingly , inhibition of the 5 9 - phosphatases SHIP1 and SHIP2 , that hydrolyse PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 into PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 31 , strongly reduced the recruitment of endophilin at the leading edge ( Fig . 5b , c and Extended Data Fig . 9c ) . As both the levels of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 andPtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 wereelevated in PTEN - inhibited cells ( ref . 32andExtendedDataFig . 9e ) , butonlythoseofPtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 were decreased in SHIP1 plus SHIP2 - depleted cells , it indicated that PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 was required fortherecruitmentofendophilin . This was confirmed by the unusual recruitment of endophilin onto endosomes / lysosomes in cells depleted for the 4 9 - phosphatases INPP4A and INPP4B ( Extended Data Fig . 9f ) .

The 5 9 - phosphatases synaptojanin 1 and 2 dephosphorylate PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 into PtdIns ( 4 ) P and bind to endophilin 1 , 19 . Overexpres - sionofsynaptojaninrepressedendophilinlevelsattheleadingedgeanddepletionenhancedit ( Fig . 5b , c and Extended Data Fig . 9c , d ) . As all of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 were increased in synaptojanin1andsynaptojanin2depletedcells ( ExtendedDataFig . 9e ) , and as the increased recruitment of endophilin at the leading edge in these cells was class I PI ( 3 ) K - and SHIP1 / 2 - dependent , we concluded that synaptojanin acts as a negative regulator for endophilin recruit - mentbyregulatingthelevelsofPtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , theprecursorofthelipid cascademediatingitsrecruitmentattheleadingedgeofcells . Theseob - servations do not preclude a role for synaptojanin in uncoating endo - philin from EPAs . Lamellipodin recruits endophilin at leading edge The requirement forPtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in the recruitment ofendophilin to the leading edge could not be explained by the lipid specificity of its N - BAR ( containingN - terminalamphipathichelices ) domain invitro 35 . Thus , we performed a domain function analysis to understand what part of endophilin was required for its targeting to the leading edge . When overexpressed in cells the N - BAR domains of endophilin - A1 , endophilin - A2 and endophilin - A3 are recruited at the leading edge ( ExtendedData Fig . 10a – d ) , butasectopic BARdomainsheterodimer - izewithendogenous endophilin ( ExtendedData Fig . 8d ) , itwasimpor - tant to test their targeting in cells depleted for endogenous endophilin . Notably , the N - BARdomain was plasma - membrane - localized inthese cells but no longer targeted the leading edge ( Fig . 5d , e and Extended DataFig . 10a – d ) . Wefurther establishedthattheSH3domain was nec - essary and sufficient for the targeting of the constructs in endophilin TKD cells . The recruitment of the SH3 domain was class I PI ( 3 ) K - and SHIP1 / 2 - dependent , and as there is , to our knowledge , no evidence in theliterature forlipid bindingby SH3domains , we hypothesized that a PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - binding protein was recruiting endophilin . Lamellipodin is the only known endophilin interactor that binds to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( refs 36 , 37 ) . Depleting cells of lamellipodin was suffi - cient to abrogate the recruitment of overexpressed SH3 domains in endophilinTKDcellsaswellasendogenousendophilinincontrolcells , even upon EGF simulation ( Fig . 5f , g and Extended Data Fig . 10e – h ) . Consistently , overexpressinglamellipodinincreasedendophilinrecruit - ment . Importantly , lamellipodinwasstilltargetedattheleadingedgein endophilinTKDcells ( Fig . 5f , h ) , confirming thatlamellipodinwas up - stream of endophilin and was recruiting it , not the other way around . As expected 36 , the recruitment of lamellipodin to the leading edge was class I PI ( 3 ) K - and SHIP1 / 2 - dependent ( thus PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - dependent ) and required its PH domain ( Fig . 5g and Extended Data Fig . 10h , i ) . Therefore , lamellipodin is the protein that senses PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and recruits endophilin at the leading edge of cells , both processes being required for b 1 - AR uptake ( Fig . 5i ) and thus FEME carrier formation .
