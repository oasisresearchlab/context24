Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the main cause of CES , with which it shares heritability . We aimed to discover novel loci associated with CES by performing a Multitrait Analysis of the GWAS ( MTAG ) with atrial fibrillation genetic data . Methods : For the MTAG analysis we used the MEGASTROKE cohort , which comprises European patients with CES and controls ( n = 362 , 661 ) and an AF cohort composed of 1 , 030 , 836 subjects . Regional genetic pleiotropy of the significant results was explored using an alternative Bayesian approach with GWAS - pairwise method . A replication was performed in an independent European cohort comprising 9 , 105 subjects using a Genome Wide Association Study ( GWAS ) . Results : MTAG - CES analysis revealed 40 novel and significant loci ( p - value < 5x10 - 8 ) associated with CES , four of which had not previously been associated with AF . A significant replication was assessed for eight novel loci : CAV1 , IGF1R , KIAA1755 , NEURL1 , PRRX1 , SYNE2 , TEX41 and WIPF1 , showing a p - value < 0 . 05 in the CES vs controls independent analysis . KIAA1755 , a locus not previously described associated with AF . Interestingly , 51 AF risk loci were not associated with CES according to GWAS - pairwise analysis . Gene Ontology ( GO ) analysis revealed that these exclusive AF genes from the 51 loci participate in processes related mainly to cardiac development , whereas genes associated with AF and CES participate mainly in muscle contraction and the conduction of electrical impulses . Conclusions : We found eight new loci associated with CES . In addition , this study provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of CES , highlighting multiple candidate genes for future functional experiments . .

The main cause of CES is atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , and the use of anticoagulants in AF patients could prevent ≈70 % of strokes 1 , more than with antiplatelet treatment 2 . Moreover , occult paroxysmal AF could be the cause of up to 16 % of undetermined strokes 3 . Nevertheless , not everybody with AF will suffer a stroke , and the use of anticoagulation involves an increased risk of major bleeding . Therefore , understanding the mechanisms that are common to both CES and AF patients in relation to the risk of having a stroke would make it possible to develop specific , more effective therapies with fewer side effects . To date , there are only eight loci associated with CES : PITX2 4 , ZHFX3 4 , RGS7 4 , NKX2 - 5 4 , ABO 4 , 5 , GNAO1 6 , PHF20 6 and locus 5q22 . 3 6 . However , even the authors doubted the reliability of RGS7 as a stroke - associated locus . Interestingly , the two most significant susceptibility loci ( PITX2 and ZFHX3 ) for CES are also the two most strongly associated with AF 4 , 7 ; in fact CES and AF have common heritability 8 . Multitrait analysis of the GWAS ( MTAG ) integrates the information contained in correlated traits to boost genetic association signals for each individual trait , providing summary - level statistics 9 . This strategy has been successfully followed to identify novel loci associated with glaucoma 10 , bone mineral density 11 and small vessel stroke 12 . Our objective was to identify novel loci associated with CES and understand the biological mechanisms shared between CES and AF by performing a MTAG and additional GWAS analysis . .

Cohorts’ description The summary statistics for the Cardioembolic Stroke analysis were obtained from the MEGASTROKE analysis ( MEGASTROKE - CES ) through the Cerebrovascular Disease Knowledge Portal ( http : / / cerebrovascularportal . org ) . This cohort was composed of 7 , 193 CES patients and 355 , 468 controls of European ancestry . The summary statistics of the Atrial Fibrillation 2018 analysis ( AF - 2018 ) were obtained from the GWAS catalog portal ( https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / gwas / ) . The AF - 2018 cohort was composed of 60 , 620 AF cases and 970 , 216 controls . The characteristics of the individuals in both studies are listed in the Online Supplement and publications 4 , 7 . Single Nucleotide Variation quality controls A series of standard quality controls ( QC ) was applied to select the single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) for the analysis . Variant exclusion criteria : 1 ) Not common to the summary statistics of the traits , 2 ) Minor allele frequency lower or equal to 0 . 01 , 3 ) Missing values , 4 ) Negative standard error or not a number value , 5 ) p - value of 0 , 6 ) Not SNVs , 7 ) Duplicated SNVs , 8 ) Strand ambiguity , and 8 ) Inconsistent allele pairs . After QCs , a total of 6 , 808 , 676 SNVs were selected ( Online Figure I ) . Locus 15q21 . 3 prioritized genes GCOM1 and MYZAP from AF - 2018 was not evaluated due to absence of the significant SNVs of AF - 2018 in the MEGASTROKE - CES analysis . Multitrait analysis of genome - wide association studies We applied multitrait analysis of the GWAS ( MTAG ) 9 , analyzing MEGASTROKE - CES and AF - 2018 summary statistics . We considered associations with CES to be .

Additionally , we tested whether the results from the MTAG - CES were consistent using an alternative Bayesian approach , to confirm pleiotropy of these loci using GWAS - pairwise 13 . This strategy reveals genomic regions that influence traits separately or pleiotropic regions that influence both traits . We used a posterior probability of pleiotropy ( PPA pleiotropy ) ≥0 . 6 to validate regions that influence both traits . Genomic inflation was estimated as lambda . Loci associated exclusively with each trait were those that were considered significant in the MEGASTROKE - CES or AF - 2018 and showed a PPA associated exclusively with one of the two traits ≥0 . 6 of the region mapped . Identification of independent and novel loci associated with CES Independent loci were defined as those > 1 megabase ( Mb ) apart in physical distance among SNVs with a genome - wide significance threshold of p - value < 5x10 −8 7 . Loci were defined as novel when SNVs had an r 2 < 0 . 1 compared with the index SNVs of the loci PITX2 4 , ZFHX3 4 , NKX2 - 5 4 , RGS7 4 , ABO 4 , 5 , PHF20 6 , GNAO1 6 and 5q22 . 3 6 that were GWAS significant in previous studies . Replication stage in an independent European cohort We performed genome - wide analyses in an independent cohort of 9 , 105 individuals ( 3 , 479 IS and 5 , 625 controls ) . IS patients were recruited if they had a measurable neurologic deficit on the NIHSS within 6 hours of the last known asymptomatic status , had been diagnosed with stroke by an experienced neurologist , which had been confirmed by neuroimaging , were over 18 years of age and were recruited via hospital - based studies between 2003 and 2020 in Spain . Controls were subjects without a history .

The control cohort was collected in blood donation at primary care centers in Barcelona and in hospitals throughout Spain . An Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee approved the study at each participating site . All patients or their relatives provided written informed consent . Further description of the cohorts is present in Online Supplement as well as array information , contribution of hospitals and clinical description ( Online Tables I - III ) . Quality control and imputation DNA samples were genotyped on commercial arrays from Illumina ( San Diego , CA ) ( Online Table II ) . Standard QCs were performed using PLINK v1 . 9 and KING v2 . 1 . 3 software . Imputation was performed in the Michigan Imputation Server Pipeline 14 using Minimac4 And HRC r1 . 1 2016 panel . Further description of QCs and imputation are present in the Online Supplement . Analysis Analyses evaluated CES vs controls ( CES = 1515 , controls = 5626 ) and AF vs absence of AF ( AF cases = 1110 , AF controls = 7791 ) . For the GWAS analyses we used an additive genetic model using fastGWA from gcta 15 . Age , sex and the first ten principal components were used as covariates . The results of the CES vs controls analysis were used to evaluate replicability ( p - value < 0 . 05 ) of the index SNVs and those significant SNVs ( MTAG - CES p - value < 5x10 - 8 ) in high LD ( r 2 > 0 . 8 ) , in the GWAS analysis of CES and to perform a Pearson correlation of the effect sizes ( log ( OR ) ) of the MTAG - CES results for the index SNVs of the loci validated by GWAS - pairwise , a strategy used in a previous study 10 . The results of the AF analysis were used to evaluate novel loci associated with AF in the MTAG . .

We also prioritized biological candidate genes generating a score based on : ( 1 ) nearest position to the index variant in a locus ; ( 2 ) expression of the gene altered by the index variant in the eQTLGen 16 or GTEx databases ; ( 3 ) methylation of the gene altered by the index variant in Phenoscanner methylation data 17 , 18 ; ( 4 ) whether the gene harbored a protein - altering index variant itself or in high linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) ( r 2 > 0 . 80 ) ; ( 5 ) whether the gene interacted physically with the index variant in HiC data of cardiomyocytes 19 . For the missense SNVs , we determined the likelihood that amino acid substitution has a deleterious effect on protein function using SIFT . Gene set analysis We conducted a WebGestalt Overrepresentation Analysis of the selected prioritized genes associated in MTAG - CES . Gene Ontology ( GO ) of biological processes was performed , as well as a Benjamini Hochberg correction of the association p - value . We defined a biological process with a q - value < 0 . 05 as statistically significant . Identification of potential drug repurposing targets Prioritized genes were searched for in the DrugBank database 20 to find potential candidate drugs for repurposing . .

MTAG software revealed mean χ 2 for AF - 2018 and MEGASTROKE - CES in 1 . 39 and 1 . 12 . The estimated equivalent GWAS sample size of the MTAG analysis for CES was of 861 , 823 individuals . A Manhattan plot of the MTAG - CES analysis and prioritized genes is shown in Figure 1 ; little evidence of genomic inflation was observed ; lambda = 1 . 02 . The MTAG - CES results revealed a total of 44 associated loci ( p - value < 5x10 - 8 ) , 40 significant novel loci associated with CES and four previously found ( Table 1 ) . All loci previously associated in MEGASTROKE - CES ( ABO , NKX2 - 5 , PITX2 and ZFHX3 ) are associated in this MTAG - CES , with the exception of the locus belonging to RGS7 gene ( top SNV rs146390073 MTAG p - value = 0 . 001 , AF - 2018 p - value = 0 . 98 ) . Other loci found significant in GWAS of CES different from MEGASTROKE , belonged to : PHF20 , GNAO1 and 5q22 . 3 region . For two of them , the association was more significant in our analysis . For the 5q22 . 3 region , top SNV rs2169955 MTAG - CES p - value = 4 . 76x10 - 7 vs MEGASTROKE - CES p - value = 6 . 13x10 - 3 , and for mapped gene PHF20 , top SNV rs11697087 MTAG - CES p - value = 6 . 62x10 - 5 vs MEGASTROKE - CES p - value = 6 . 05x10 - 4 . GNAO1 was not evaluated in our study due to absence of the index SNV in AF - 2018 . New candidate loci associated with CES After gene prioritization , 53 genes were selected from the 44 loci ( Online Table IV ) . Novel loci showed a high degree of functionality of the SNVs as missense variants , eQTL , mQTLs , and HiC physical interaction ( Online Tables V - VIII ) . .

Evaluation of the index SNVs and SNVs in high LD revealed 56 SNVs with a p - value < 0 . 05 ; these SNVs belong to 11 different loci , three already known PITX2 , ZFHX3 , NKX2 - 5 and eight of them novel , prioritized genes : CAV1 , IGF1R , KIAA1755 , NEURL1 , PRRX1 , SYNE2 , TEX41 and WIPF1 ( Online Table IX ) . NEURL1 locus was already found associated in the all types of stroke analysis of MEGASTROKE but not genome - wide significant in CES analysis 4 . Pearson correlation of the effect sizes ( log ( OR ) ) between index variants of the significant loci in the MTAG - CES and the CES analysis in an independent cohort was evaluated for 41 of the 44 index variants , due to the poor imputation value ( INFO < 0 . 6 ) of three of them in the Spanish cohort . A significant correlation was obtained ; p - value = 2 . 7x10 - 8 , cor = 0 . 74 ( Figure 4 ) . This association remained after removing the four SNVs from previously known loci ( rs17042098 , PITX2 ; rs2106261 , ZFHX3 ; rs6891790 , NKX2 - 5 and rs635634 , ABO ) p - value = 4 . 2x10 - 7 , cor = 0 . 72 . The top five most significant loci in the MTAG - CES analysis were PITX2 and ZFHX3 ( previously known loci ) , and KCNN3 , NEURL1 , and CAV1 ( novel loci ) , the last two validated in the replication cohort . Interestingly , we found loci not previously described in AF or CES with four prioritized genes : PHTF2 , KIAA1755 , NCOR2 , and FILIP1 . FILIP1 locus also reached genome - wide significance in the MTAG results for AF . Functional annotation of the index SNVs revealed rs3746471 as a missense variant of the KIAA1755 gene coding for R1045W , and it was predicted to be deleterious with a SIFT score of 0 . 007 . The FILIP1 index variant was additionally evaluated in the AF GWAS in the independent cohort , revealing a suggestive p - value with consistent direction of the .

Biological processes of loci associated with CES and AF and biological processes of loci associated exclusively to AF GO of biological processes from the Genome - Wide loci of the MTAG - CES analysis revealed 85 enriched gene sets ( Figure 2 , Online Table X ) ; the top biological processes were : cardiac muscle contraction , actin filament - based movement and cardiac conduction . A DrugBank search for the 53 prioritized genes associated with CES revealed a total of 87 drugs ( Online Table XI ) that target 10 of the prioritized genes . The study of the 111 AF - 2018 significant loci ( Online Table XII ) using GWAS - pairwise strategy suggests 51 loci that have an exclusive association with AF risk and a lack of association with CES . A biological processes analysis of the genes associated exclusively with AF ( Figure 3 , Online Table XIII ) revealed 25 biological processes exclusive to AF risk and mainly associated with cardiac development processes ( Figure 2 , Online Table XIV ) . DISCUSSION Using a multitrait analysis ( MTAG ) with the two biggest cohorts of CES 4 and AF 7 to date , we expanded the number of loci associated with CES from eight to sixteen . In the MTAG analysis , 44 loci were found associated with CES . Four of them were previously known associations : PITX2 , ZFHX3 , NKX2 - 5 and ABO . To explore replicability of the MTAG results , we conducted genome - wide analysis for CES and AF in an independent European cohort comprising 9 , 105 subjects . We found significant associations ( p - value < 0 . 05 ) of 56 SNVs from 11 loci ( eight of them novel associations ) ; prioritized known genes : PITX2 , ZFHX3 , NKX2 - 5 , prioritized novel genes : CAV1 , IGF1R , .

Moreover , given the small sample size of the replication stage compared with the estimated sample size of the MTAG , we did not expect all the SNVs to be strongly associated , but rather that the odds ratios would be highly concordant , for that we performed Pearson correlation of the effect sizes for the index SNVs in MTAG - CES analysis . The Pearson correlation revealed a positive and significant correlation in this new cohort , showing most of the SNVs in the expected direction of the effect . Following the methodology used in other similar studies 10 , the presence of this significant correlation suggests potential validation of our MTAG - CES results . Interestingly , CAV1 has been associated with platelet count and systolic blood pressure , among other traits 21 . Besides , caveolin - 1 , the protein encoded by CAV1 in endothelial cells , plays a key role in how gas6 exerts its prothrombotic role in the vasculature 22 . Regarding the other genes , and among other human traits in GWAS , IGF1R and WIPF1 have been found associated with QRS duration 23 , 24 and platelet crit 25 , 26 . NEURL1 is associated with white matter hyperintensity volume 27 , red blood cell count 28 and to all types of stroke risk 4 . PRRX1 , SYNE2 and TEX41 have been associated with PR interval 29 – 31 and SYNE2 also associated with platelet count 30 . It is worth noting , that of these replicated loci , locus 20q11 . 23 , prioritized gene : KIAA1755 , has not previously been found associated with AF . The index variant of this locus , rs3746471 - A , codes for R1045W amino acid change , predicted to be deleterious according to SIFT . rs3746471 - A , has been previously described associated with heart rate 32 – 34 and PR interval 34 , and remarkably suggestively associated with stroke infarct volume ( p - value = 6 . 80x10 - 7 ) 35 , 36 . KIAA1755 is predicted to encode an uncharacterized protein and is only characterized at the transcriptional level . The transcript is highly expressed in the brain and nerves and is also expressed in the heart . .

Using MTAG strategy , we were also able to analyze the output of AF - 2018 enhanced by MEGASTROKE - CES . In this direction , a novel locus , 6q14 . 1 , was found significantly associated with AF . FILIP1 is the gene prioritized ; it encodes for a filamin A binding protein . Interestingly , FILIP1 has been identified previously as a regulator of myogenesis differentiation , in human cells and in an in vivo mouse model 37 . In the replication stage , this SNV was found suggestive ( p - value = 0 . 09 ) , highly probable due to the small sample size in comparison to MTAG analysis . The study of previous known loci associated with CES in the MTAG - CES analysis showed that the RGS7 4 previously genome - wide significant in the MEGASTROKE was not associated with CES in our study . This could be explained by a causal mechanism other than AF in the risk of suffering CES or the possibility of a false positive result , as authors suspected in the MEGASTROKE study given the low allele frequency and poor imputation 4 . The evaluation of loci found in GWAS of CES different from MEGASTROKE ( PHF20 , GNAO1 and 5q22 . 3 region ) , revealed 5q22 . 3 and PHF20 loci with stronger significance in our study . This could be considered a reinforcement of these two signals and their relation to CES risk via AF . Sadly , GNAO1 was not evaluated due to the lack of the index variant in AF - 2018 . Globally , from the 44 loci genome - wide associated in the MTAG - CES , 53 genes were prioritized in our study : the top previously known genes were PITX2 and ZFHX3 and other top novel genes were NEURL1 and CAV1 . The prioritized genes were involved in biological processes , such as cardiac muscle contraction , actin filament - based .

Remarkably , among the 111 loci previously associated with AF , a group of 51 loci had an exclusive genetic association with AF and a lack of association with CES using GWAS - pairwise . Apparently , no statistical differences were observed between the AF loci associated with CES and those with no association . GO of biological processes revealed 43 gene sets that were only enriched by the AF exclusive genes and not present in the biological processes of the 44 loci associated with CES ; these biological processes were related mainly to cardiac development . These genes exclusively associated with AF could be important for understanding the risk of CES occurrence , and thereby help to develop more specific prevention drugs or to create better genetic scores for identifying AF patients with high risk of suffering a stroke . Our study has limitations , as there is a known overlap of individuals between the MEGASTROKE - CES and AF - 2018 studies . However , MTAG permits sample overlap between the GWAS summary data of the traits by conducting bivariate LD score regression of the traits 9 . Additionally , the difference in the sample size between the two original studies is a concern , on the other hand MTAG estimation of χ 2 revealed an scenario expected to be strong against false positives , as tested in the original publication 9 . To control this , we performed a replication analysis in an independent cohort to validate the results obtained . Another limitation is that the MTAG approach relies on the relatively strong assumption that associated variants act on both traits , which may not always be the case for CES and AF . To control this , we only considered SNVs reaching the GWAS significant p - value , showing an association with both traits and having a PPA pleiotropy of the genomic region = > 0 . 6 in the GWAS - pairwise . In addition , we performed a replication step in an independent cohort to further evaluate .

Although this replication is objectively weak compared to the MTAG analysis , we hypothesize that more loci found in our study will be validated when an equivalent cohort in the future is analyzed . It is also important to mention that through this strategy we have only found loci associated to CES risk due to AF , and therefore further multitrait analysis should be performed with different traits to uncover the different high - risk sources of CES . To summarize , in our study , we identified 40 novel loci associated with CES through a multitrait analysis enhanced by AF , and we were able to replicate eight of them in an independent cohort . This study provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of CES , its relation to AF and highlights multiple candidates for use in future functional experiments to identify specific mechanisms conferring a risk of CES that could be targeted therapeutically . .
