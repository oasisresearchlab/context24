We aimed to better under - stand the transmission dynamics and identify age - specific transmission characteristics for the epidemic . Methods Data on COVID - 19 cases were collected from the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission during the period from 20th February to 1st June . The effective reproductive number ( R t ) and transmission distance between cases were calculated . An age - structured SEIR model with social contact patterns was developed to reconstruct the transmission dynamics and evaluate age - specific transmission characteristics . Least square method was used to cali - brate the model . Basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) was estimated with next generation matrix . Results R 0 of Omicron variant was 7 . 9 ( 95 % CI : 7 . 4 to 8 . 4 ) . With strict interventions , R t had dropped quickly from 3 . 6 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 7 to 4 . 7 ) on 4th March to below 1 on 18th April . The mean transmission distance of the Omicron epidemic in Shanghai was 13 . 4 km ( 95 % CI : 11 . 1 to 15 . 8 km ) , which was threefold longer compared with that of epidemic caused by the wild - type virus in Wuhan , China . The model estimated that there would have been a total 870 , 845 ( 95 % CI : 815 , 400 to 926 , 289 ) cases for the epidemic from 20th February to 15th June , and 27 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : 24 . 4 % to 30 . 9 % ) cases would have been unascertained . People aged 50 – 59 years had the highest transmission risk 0 . 216 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 210 to 0 . 222 ) , and the highest secondary attack rate ( 47 . 62 % , 95 % CI : 38 . 71 % to 56 . 53 % ) . Conclusions The Omicron variant spread more quickly and widely than other variants and resulted in about one third cases unascertained for the recent outbreak in Shanghai . Prioritizing isolation and screening of people aged 40 – 59 might suppress the epidemic more effectively . Routine surveillance among people aged 40 – 59 years could also provide insight into the stage of the epidemic and the timely detection of new variants . Trial registration We did not involve clinical trial .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 743 Background Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) Omicron variant was designated as a variant of concern ( VOC ) by the World Health Organiza - tion ( WHO ) on 26th November 2021 , it has been rapidly spreading and has become the dominant variant circulat - ing globally [ 1 ] . Since the first Omicron case in Shanghai was reported on 20th February , the outbreak has resulted in more than 600 , 000 people being infected as of 1st June . Phylogenetic features of SARS - CoV - 2 viral genomes from 129 patients , and inferring their relationship with those available on the GISAID database , indicated that the new viral genomes in Shanghai were clustered into the SARS - CoV - 2 BA . 2 sub - lineage [ 2 ] . To suppress the transmission based on the “Zero - COVID” policy , non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) are implemented including physical distancing , mandatory use of face masks , mass nucleic acid amplification testing ( NAAT ) / rapid antigen testing ( RAT ) and quarantine / isolation . Even with the massive NAAT / RAT screening , there might have been unascer - tained / undetected cases , which might have influenced the transmission dynamics . The spatial characteristics of Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) are of great significance for assessing transmission characteristics of the disease and for guid - ing implementation of interventions [ 3 , 4 ] . Infectious individuals are often clustered in space during the ini - tial phase of sustained transmission , which provides an opportunity to make effective use of limited resources for intervention [ 5 ] . Estimation of the transmission distance between cases contribute to targeting resources both for control and enhanced surveillance [ 6 ] . Age dependent susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion as well as the infectiousness upon infection have a significant impact on implementation of public health interventions . Most studies suggested that the suscep - tibility of children was lower than that of adults and the elderly [ 7 – 10 ] or no significant difference in infectivity among different age groups [ 7 , 8 ] , while other studies found an increased transmissibility in adults or elderly people [ 11 , 12 ] . The vaccination coverage varied with age , which might drive the transition of COVID - 19 bur - den [ 13 ] . Assessing age - specific susceptibility and trans - mission risk is conductive to understand transmission dynamics and improve the effectiveness of interventions through prioritizing different interventions in different age groups . In the current study , we investigated the dynamics of transmission during the Omicron epidemic in Shanghai between March and June 2022 , estimated transmission distance between cases and developed an age - structured SEIR ( Susceptible , Exposed , Infectious and Recovered ) model to reconstruct the transmission dynamics for the Omicron epidemic in Shanghai , to estimate the sus - ceptibility and transmissibility of different age groups and assess the age prioritization of implementation of interventions . Methods Data collection COVID - 19 infection data in Shanghai from 20th Febru - ary to 1st June 2022 were from the daily reports released by the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission ( https : / / wsjkw . sh . gov . cn / ) . Information on sex , age , residential address and clinical classification was only available for cases reported before 17th March . Parameters used in our model were form previous studies or estimated by the least square method ( LSM ) , and were presented in Additional file 1 : Table S1 [ 14 – 17 ] . Age‑structured SEIR model An age - structured SEIR model considered age - struc - tured differences in population mixing was developed . Based on the vaccination ( Additional file 1 : Role of vac - cination [ 15 , 18 , 19 ] ) and social contact characteristics ( Additional file 1 : Constructing social contact matrix [ 20 , 21 ] ) , the population was divided into 10 age groups ( i ) : 0 – 2 , 3 – 11 , 12 – 17 , 18 – 29 , 30 – 39 , 40 – 49 , 50 – 59 , 60 – 69 , 70 – 79 and 80 + . Susceptible ( S i ) infected by infectious cases ( asymptomatic infection : A i , presymptomatic infection : P i , and symptomatic cases : I i ) would become exposed ( E i and E iQ ) . Exposed individuals were not infec - tious and not detected by NAAT / RAT . After the latent period ( α ) , a proportion ( p A ) of exposed individuals became asymptomatic infection ( A i , A iQ ) , others became presymptomatic infection ( P i , P iQ ) . After a certain period ( α 2 , incubation period – latent period ) , a presympto - matic infection become a symptomatic infection ( I i , I iQ ) . All cases became recovered individuals ( R i ) if they were no longer contagious . The superscript i refers to differ - ent age groups ( i = 1 , 2 , . . . . . . , 10 ) , subscript Q indi - cated that the individuals were isolated / treated and could not infect susceptible people . Asymptomatic ( A i ) and presymptomatic ( P i ) infection would be quarantined / isolated with positive NAAT results . In our model , we assumed that from 28th March to 12th April , a propor - tion ( 1 − p t ) of asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases who were detected through NAAT would be self - isola - tion at home ( A iH , P iH ) due to the limitation of central - ized isolation resources ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1 ) . A i H and P iH would only infect their family members ( CM H ) . The model could be described in Fig . 1 and the equa - tions in Additional file 1 : Model calibration . All param - eters of our model were presented in the Additional file 1 : Table S1 [ 14 – 17 ] . Page 3 of 12 Zhu et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 743 Statistical analysis Estimating effective reproduction number The effective reproductive number ( R t ) was calculated using the method developed by Cori er al [ 22 ] in R soft - ware version 4 . 1 . 2 . The daily number of reported infec - tions and the serial interval ( mean : 3 . 5 days , standard deviation ( SD ) : 2 . 4 days [ 17 ] ) for the Omicron variant from a previous study [ 17 ] were used to estimate R t and its 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) on each day via a 7 - day moving average . For sensitivity analysis , a 4 - day moving average was used to estimate the R t . Estimating transmission distance Based on the location data of 1482 cases reported before 17th March and the generation time distribu - tion ( Gamma distribution with mean : 3 . 3 days and SD : 3 . 5 days [ 23 ] ) , we used the method developed by Salje et al . [ 6 ] to estimate the transmission distance between cases . We assumed the transmission distance distribu - tion to follow a typical power law distribution , where the key parameter , λ , could be calculated by the mean trans - mission distance . To compare the transmission distance among different variants , cases in the initial period of Wuhan epidemic ( 8th December 2019 to 14th January 2020 ) were used to estimate the transmission distances . During the initial period of the epidemic in these two cit - ies , few strict NPIs were implemented . Calibrating the model and estimating the proportion of unascertained cases With the number of daily reported cases , the least square method ( LSM ) was used to calibrate the model and to estimate the age - specific transmission rate ( β i , Addi - tional file 1 : Model calibration ) . Transmission rate ( β i ) in this study is defined as probability that one contact between a case and a susceptible person will result in an effective infection . The next generation matrix ( NGM ) was used to estimate the basic reproduction number ( R 0 , Additional file 1 : Next generation matrix [ 24 – 26 ] ) . In our model , unascertained cases refer to asymp - tomatic cases that are not traced and not detected by NAAT / RAT before they are not contagious . Based on the calibrated model , the cumulative number of unas - certained cases ( Cuf i ) and all cases ( C i , ascertained and unascertained ) in each age group were calculated accord - ing to the following equations . The proportion of unas - certained cases was calculated by the sum of dCuf i dt divided by the sum of dC i dt . Fig . 1 Flow patterns between different compartments in the model Page 4 of 12 Zhu et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 743 With the β i and SAR , we inferred the susceptibility and infectivity and tried to prioritize different age groups for centralized isolation and NAAT / RAT ( Additional file 1 : Inferring the susceptibility and infectivity ) . To assess the robustness of our results , sensitivity analyses were carried out on the major parameters in the model ( Additional file 1 : Sensitivity analysis ) . Differ - ent values of these parameters were used to recalibrate the model to assess their effects on age - specific trans - mission rates ( β i ) , proportion of cases found by NAAT / RAT , SARs , cumulative incidences , R 0 and proportion of unascertained cases ( Additional file 1 : Table S2 and Fig - ure S2 ) . Additionally , we accessed the impacts of propor - tion of untraced cases ( p E ) , proportion of asymptomatic cases ( p A ) and proportion of cases found by NAAT / RAT ( p NAAT ) on the proportion of unascertained cases . Estimation of the transmission distance was performed in MATLAB 2021a . Development and calibration of the model , estimation of R 0 , the proportion of unascertained cases and secondary attack rate , sensitivity analysis and visualization of results were performed in R software ver - sion 4 . 1 . 2 . Results Spatio‑temporal diffusion characteristics From 20th February to 1st June , there were 626 , 825 reported COVID - 19 cases in Shanghai , and among whom , 94 . 3 % ( 591 , 358 / 626 , 825 ) were asymptomatic . The first home quarantine directive was implemented in six districts ( Chongming , Fengxian , Jinshan , Minhang , Pudong and Songjiang ) since 28th March , and a citywide home quarantine with mass screening of NAAT / RAT was put in place on 4 April . The number of daily reported cases peaked on 13 April ( Fig . 2A ) . R t decreased from 3 . 6 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 7 to 4 . 7 ) on 4th March to 1 . 5 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 4 to 1 . 6 ) on 16th March . R t increased afterwards due to mass screening of NAAT / RAT and stabilized at 1 . 7 to 2 . 1 dur - ing the period from 17th March to 7th April . Since 7th April , the R t gradually decreased and fell below 1 on 18th April ( R t = 0 . 98 , 95 % CI : 0 . 97 to 0 . 99 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . Based on our model , R 0 of the Omicron epidemic in Shanghai was 7 . 9 ( 95 % CI : 7 . 4 to 8 . 4 ) . If COVID - 19 vaccines were not available , R 0 would increase to 9 . 6 ( 95 % CI : 9 . 0 to 10 . 2 ) . Figure 2C shows the epidemic curves of cumulative predicted cases and reported cases for the epidemic . The model predicted the epidemic to end in mid - June with a total of 870 , 845 ( 95 % CI : 815 , 400 to 926 , 289 ) cases , but among them , 241 , 104 ( 95 % CI : 201 , 373 to 280 , 835 ) dCuf i dt = β i ∗ S i ∗ p inv ∗ p E ∗ CM ∗ ε A i + ε P i + I i + CM H ∗ ε A iH + ε P iH Ni − p t ∗ p NAAT ∗ A i + P i α 3 − A iH + P iH α H − I i α 4 dC i dt = β i ∗ S i ∗ p inv ∗ p E ∗ CM ∗ ε A i + ε P i + I i + CM H ∗ ε A iH + ε P iH N i cases might be missed . We estimated that there had been 99 , 687 ( 95 % CI : 85 , 020 to 114 , 355 ) cases on 28th March and 81 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 77 . 4 % to 84 . 8 % ) were unascertained ( Fig . 2D ) . Pudong had the most reported infections ( 35 . 5 % ) , fol - lowed by Minhang ( 10 . 1 % ) , and Jinshan had the least reported infections ( 0 . 2 % , Additional file 1 : Figure S3 ) . There were substantially geographic differences in the cumulative incidence ( Fig . 3C ) . In the early stage of the epidemic , the mean transmission distance between cases was estimated to be 13 . 4 km ( 95 % CI : 11 . 1 to 15 . 8 ) ( Fig . 3A ) , which was threefold longer compared with the wild - type virus epidemic in Wuhan ( 4 . 4 km ; 95 % CI : 1 . 5 to 7 . 3 ; Fig . 3B ) . The transmission distance for the Shang - hai epidemic varied from 12 . 5 km ( 95 % CI : 11 . 2 to 13 . 9 ) on 15th March to 14 . 9 km ( 95 % CI : 13 . 5 to 16 . 3 ) on 12th March . The transmission distance fluctuated around 13 . 4 km before 12th March , while decreased since school closure and suspension of public transportation started on 12th March . Based on the location of cases , Fig . 3D and Additional file 2 : Movie S1 show that as of 13th March , the virus had spread widely across the city . Com - pared to the Wuhan epidemic for the date with the same cumulative number of cases , the size of epidemic areas with high risk levels was larger in Shanghai even with more strict intervention measures ( Additional file 1 : Fig - ure S4 ) . Change of contact patterns and age‑specific transmission characteristics Population mobility had decreased gradually since the start of the epidemic ( Fig . 4A ) . During the initial phase of the epidemic , it declined most markedly among indi - viduals aged 0 – 16 and 60 + years and to the half of the original level after school closure ( 12th March ) . Since the implementation of citywide home quarantine , mobil - ity declined to the minimum . Comparing to the mobil - ity before the epidemic , children and adolescents had the greatest decline . Figure 4B shows that the frequency of human contacts declined for all the age group since the start of the outbreak . The decline was pronounced after 28th March , when home quarantine was implemented . Contact matrices at different settings over the seven peri - ods were presented in Additional file 1 : Figure S5 . Among the 870 , 845 cases estimated for the epidemic , 60 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 56 . 4 % to 64 . 5 % ) were aged 30 – 59 years , 6 . 4 % ( 95 % CI : 5 . 3 % to 7 . 4 % ) were aged 70 years or older , and 0 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 6 % to 1 . 0 % ) were children under 3 years of age ( Fig . 5A , B ) . Compared to the wild - type virus epidemic of Wuhan , cases in the Omicron epidemic of Shanghai were younger ( Additional file 1 : Figure S6 [ 27 , 28 ] ) . Population aged 50 – 59 years had the highest cumulative incidence ( 519 . 5 / 10 , 000 , 95 % CI : 422 . 1 / 10 , 00 Page 5 of 12 Zhu et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 743 to 616 . 9 / 10 , 000 ) , followed by the 40 – 49 - year age group ( 459 . 7 / 10 , 000 , 95 % CI : 364 . 0 / 10 , 000 to 555 . 4 / 10 , 000 ) and the 12 – 17 - year age group ( 389 . 1 / 10 , 000 , 95 % CI : 309 . 0 / 10 , 000 to 469 . 4 / 10 , 000 ; Fig . 5C ) . The cumulative incidence was relatively low in children under 3 years of age ( 145 . 8 / 10 , 000 , 95 % CI : 111 . 1 / 10 , 000 to 180 . 6 / 10 , 000 ) and elderly people aged 70 – 79 years ( 226 . 7 / 10 , 000 , 95 % CI : 172 . 2 / 10 , 000 to 281 . 1 / 10 , 000 ) . The transmission rate varied with age ( Fig . 5D ) . Cases under the age of 3 years had the lowest transmission rate ( 0 . 008 , 95 % CI : 0 . 007 to 0 . 009 ) . The transmission rate increased with age and peaked at the age of 50 – 59 years 0 . 216 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 210 to 0 . 222 ) and then declined after 60 years . Figure 5E pre - sents the model estimated SAR . The SAR was the lowest in children ( 0 to 2 years : 1 . 80 % , 95 % CI : 1 . 39 % to 2 . 20 % ) and the highest in adults aged 50 – 59 years ( 47 . 62 % , 95 % CI : 38 . 71 % to 56 . 53 % ) . Cases of different ages were more likely to infect their peer groups ( Fig . 5F ) . Cases of chil - dren and adolescents were also more likely to infect their parents or other family members . Cases aged 50 to 59 resulted in the most secondary cases ( 3 . 8 cases / day ; 95 % CI : 3 . 0 to 4 . 5 cases / day ) followed by 40 – 49 years ( 3 . 5 cases / day ; 95 % CI : 3 . 1 to 3 . 9 cases / day ) and 30 – 39 years ( 3 . 4 cases / day ; 95 % CI : 3 . 1 to 3 . 8 cases / day ) .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 743 According to the susceptibility and infectivity of dif - ferent ages , we analyzed the priority of centralized isolation and implementation of NAAT / RAT for differ - ent age groups . Prioritizing the centralized isolation of cases aged 50 to 59 years could reduce the largest num - ber ( 28 . 8 % , 95 % CI : 23 . 3 % to 34 . 3 % ) of secondary cases , followed by 30 to39 years ( 23 . 5 % , 95 % CI : 19 . 0 % to 28 . 0 % ) . Prioritizing the centralized isolation of children ( 0 . 05 % , 95 % CI : 0 . 04 % to 0 . 06 % ) or elderly cases aged above 80 ( 1 . 0 % , 95 % CI : 0 . 8 % to 1 . 3 % ) had less impact on reducing the number of secondary cases caused by self - isolation at home ( Fig . 5G ) . Lifting mass NAAT / RAT for those aged 30 to 49 could result in more cases ( 30 – 39 : 1 , 219 , 758 , 95 % CI : 1 , 115 , 473 to 1 , 324 , 042 ; 40 – 49 : 1 , 323 , 445 95 % CI : 1 , 185 , 313 to 1 , 461 , 577 ) , while lifting mass NAAT / RAT for those aged 0 – 17 and 70 years above only had a slight influence on the cumu - lative number of cases ( Fig . 5H ) . Sensitivity analysis To assess the impact of different moving average on the estimation of R t , a 4 - day moving average was used to esti - mate the R t ( Additional file 1 : Figure S7 ) . R t estimated from 4 - day moving average were similar to that estimated from 7 - day moving average . R t estimated from 4 - day moving average fell below 1 on 18th March . To explore the robustness of our model and results , the relative transmissibility rate of asymptomatic cases to symptomatic cases ( ε ) , proportion of asymptomatic cases ( p A ) , period of self - isolation at home ( α H ) and recov - ery period of asymptomatic cases ( γ A ) were included in the sensitivity analysis ( Fig . 6 ) . The model was well cali - brated with different values of these parameters ( Addi - tional file 1 : Figure S8 ) . Most of the outcomes were not sensitive to the changes of these parameters . Transmis - sion rate ( β i ) and SAR i increased with the decreasing of ε , but were stable to the change of other three parameters . Proportion of cases found by NAAT / RAT was stable to Fig . 5 Epidemic curves ( A , B ) , cumulative incidence ( C ) and distribution of transmission rates ( D ) in different ages . E shows the secondary attack rates ( SARs ) in different ages calculated based on the model estimated infections . Grey dashed line in E was the overall SAR ( 24 . 17 % , 95 % CI : 23 . 09 % to 25 . 25 % ) . F shows the age distribution of daily secondary cases infected by index cases in different ages . G is the number of secondary cases infected by index cases that are self - isolated at home . Ref in G is the scenario that all age groups of cases were self - isolated at home ; other scenarios prioritize centralized isolation of cases in different age groups . H shows the distribution of the cumulative number of cases if the NAAT / RAT is lifted in each age group . Ref in H is the scenario that NAAT / RAT are implemented in all age groups Page 8 of 12 Zhu et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 743 the change of these parameters . Cumulative incidence decreased with the increasing of γ A . Basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) was sensitive to α H and γ A . Proportion of unascertained cases decreased with the reducing of p A and with the increasing of γ A . Additionally , we accessed the impacts of proportion of untraced cases ( p E ) and proportion of cases found by NAAT / RAT ( p NAAT ) on the proportion of unascertained cases by sensitivity analysis . Results suggested that the proportion of unascertained cases increased with the increasing of p E , but declined with the increasing of p NAAT ( Additional file 1 : Figure S9 ) . Discussion Based on the epidemic of Shanghai , we estimated that the R 0 of Omicron variant was 7 . 9 , comparable to the results of previous studies [ 29 ] . At the beginning of the epidemic , R t was estimated to be 3 . 6 , consistent with the results of previous studies ( 2 . 43 to 5 . 11 ) [ 29 – 31 ] . For both R 0 and R t , Omicron variant were 3 - to fourfold higher than these of Delta variant [ 29 – 31 ] . Increasing basic / effective reproductive number of Omicron vari - ant have led to a rebound of the epidemic in numerous countries . The Omicron variant is highly transmissi - ble with a high growth advantage over other variants , which is mainly driven by immune evasion [ 1 , 32 , 33 ] . From the reported data , the proportion of asymptomatic cases in the epidemic of Shanghai reached 90 % . People infected with the Omicron variant have milder symp - toms and fewer hospitalizations than those with other variants [ 34 , 35 ] , which lead to high covertness of this variant . The cumulative number of cases in the Omicron epidemic of Shanghai was estimated to be 870 , 845 , and only 72 . 2 % of them would have been ascertained . We estimated that there were 85 . 1 % cases that were unas - certained , before the implementation of home quaran - tine directive on 28th March . A previous study of the Fig . 6 Impacts of the relative transmissibility rate of asymptomatic cases to symptomatic cases ( ε , A1 - A4 ) , proportion of asymptomatic cases ( p A , B1 - B4 ) , period of self - isolation at home ( α H , C1 - C4 ) and recovery period of asymptomatic cases ( γ A , D1 - D4 ) on the transmission rates ( β , first row ) , proportion of cases found by NAAT / RAT ( p NAAT , second row ) , secondary attack rates ( SAR , third row ) , cumulative incidences ( fourth row ) , basic reproduction number ( R 0 , E ) and proportion of unascertained cases ( F ) . Grey dashed line in E is the R 0 reported in main analysis ( 7 . 9 ) . Grey dashed line in F is the proportion of unascertained cases estimated in main analysis ( 27 . 7 % ) Page 9 of 12 Zhu et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 743 Wuhan epidemic indicated that 86 % of all the infections were unascertained before the 23rd January 2020 travel restrictions [ 36 ] , where suspension of public transporta - tion and NAAT / RAT were not implemented before travel restrictions in Wuhan [ 27 ] . Additionally , it took 46 days in Wuhan and 36 days in Shanghai from the first case reported ( 8th December 2019 in Wuhan [ 37 ] and 20th February 2022 in Shanghai ) to reach the same proportion of unascertained cases . Due to the highly transmissible and covert nature of the Omicron variant , mass vaccina - tion and appropriate measures are necessary to decrease transmission and reduce mortality . The Omicron variant also appeared to be spreading more widely , reflected by the mean transmission dis - tance . During the initial period of the epidemic , the mean transmission distance of the Omicron epidemic in Shanghai was threefold longer than that of the wild - type virus epidemic in Wuhan . The longer transmission distance may indicate a more rapid spatial transmission of Omicron variant than the wild - type virus . The trans - mission distance of the epidemic in Shanghai decreased slightly since school closure and suspension of pub - lic transportation started on 12th March , reflected the impacts of NPIs on controlling the transmission of virus . Before 7th March , the spread of the virus was relatively localized and had not yet affected the entire city . These results suggested that earlier implementing NPIs may contribute to curbing the spatial transmission of the virus and reduce infections . The spatial spread of the virus can be determined by the estimation of the transmission dis - tance , which contributes to targeting resources both for control and enhanced surveillance [ 6 ] . We estimated 60 . 1 % cases were aged 30 – 59 years , 5 . 4 % were children under the age of 12 years , and 2 . 4 % were aged 80 years or older . The age for the cases of Shang - hai epidemic tended to be younger than those in the epidemic of Wuhan [ 27 , 28 ] and other localized out - breaks [ 38 ] . Cases infected with Omicron variant were found to be younger than cases infected with other vari - ants [ 35 ] , partly due to COVID - 19 vaccination [ 13 ] . The overall SAR of the epidemic was estimated to be 24 . 17 % ( 95 % CI : 23 . 09 % to 25 . 25 % ) , which was consistent with previous studies [ 39 – 42 ] . Compared to observational studies , our SARs of children , adolescents , adults aged 60 years and above are lower , while SARs of adults aged 18 – 60 years are higher . SARs from observational stud - ies might be biased by the ability of close contact track - ing and detection of infections . For children and elderly , the number of close contacts they report is likely to be underestimated , which may result high SARs . Besides , it is difficult to detect all infections even massive nucleic acid testing was implemented . The underestimated num - ber of infections might lead to a low SAR . In our analysis , if the SARs was calculated using the number of detect - able cases ( reported cases ) , the overall SAR reduced to 17 . 49 % ( 95 % CI : 16 . 25 % to 18 . 71 % , Additional file 1 : Fig - ure S10 ) . There seems to be no consensus about infectivity of different ages . Some studies indicated that the differ - ences of infectivity among different age groups were not significant [ 7 , 8 ] , while the other studies reported an increased transmissibility among adults and elderly peo - ple [ 11 , 12 ] . Besides , previous studies suggested that the susceptibility increased with age [ 8 , 11 , 43 ] . In this study , both transmission rate and SAR increased with age and peaked for people aged 50 – 59 years . People aged 50 – 59 report higher daily contacts , even during the lockdown period [ 21 ] , which might lead to higher risk of infectivity and susceptibility . Additionally , patients aged 50 – 64 yeas seemed to have the long viral shedding time [ 44 , 45 ] and higher viral load [ 46 ] , which may associate with higher transmission rate . Age - specific transmission rate and SAR are crucial to guide policymakers in implementing targeted COVID - 19 control measures . Although the transmission rate and SAR in children and adolescents were lower , the transmissibility of them to other household members is not negligible . Extending vaccination to children aged 3 – 11 years would protect them from infection and reduce the transmission of this age group [ 13 ] . Cases with self - isolation at home could still infect susceptible people , such as their family members or neighbors [ 7 , 47 ] . Prior - itizing the isolation of cases aged 30 – 59 years and imple - mentation of NAAT among population aged 30 – 49 years might curb the virus transmission and reduce the num - ber of cases more efficiently . Routine surveillance among people aged 40 – 59 years could also provide insight into the stage of the epidemic and the timely detection of new variants . Promoting vaccination , encouraging mask - wearing and physical distancing , particularly among people aged 30 – 49 years , are still effective measures to reduce COVID - 19 transmission and mortality . This study was limited by the absence of detail infor - mation of the cases . The age distribution of cases in the early stage of the epidemic was used in the model calibra - tion , which might result in biased estimation , especially for the age - specific transmission rate . We used the social contact matrix that was produced during 2019 , and peo - ple’s contact habits might be reshaped by the COVID - 19 pandemic and some intervention measures . Many parameters used in the model are assumed to be con - stant respect to time and age , but our sensitivity analysis suggested that our model and results were stable to the changes of these parameters . Detail information of cases and time - varying / age - specific parameters could allow us to provide a better reconstruction of the Shanghai’s Page 10 of 12 Zhu et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 743 Omicron epidemic and reduce the biases of results . Besides , the transmission distances may be affected by people’s activities and the development level of the city . To further explore the regularity of the COVID - 19 spa - tial transmission , more cities and variables should be included in the future studies . Conclusions The Omicron variant presented a higher transmissibility and spread more widely and quickly than other variants , which might have resulted in about one third positive cases undetected in this wave of epidemic in Shanghai . People aged 50 – 59 years had the highest transmission risk and secondary attack rate . Prioritizing centralized isolation and screening of people aged 40 – 59 years might have suppressed the epidemic more effectively . Rou - tine surveillance among these age groups may also pro - vide insight into the stage of the epidemic and the timely detection of new variants .
