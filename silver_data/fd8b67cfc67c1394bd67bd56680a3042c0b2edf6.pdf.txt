Weitz , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , and approved February 15 , 2013 ( received for review September 4 , 2012 ) Regulation of the cellular volume is fundamental for cell survival and function . Deviations from equilibrium trigger dedicated signaling and transcriptional responses that mediate water homeostasis and volume recovery . Cells are densely packed with proteins , and molecular crowding may play an important role in cellular processes . Indeed , increasing molecular crowding has been shown to modify the kinetics of biochemical reactions in vitro ; however , the effects of molecular crowding in living cells are mostly unexplored . Here , we report that , inyeast , asudden reduction in cellular volume , induced by severe osmotic stress , slows down the dynamics of several signaling cascades , including the stress - response pathways required for osmotic adaptation . We show that increasing osmotic compression decreases protein mobility and can eventually lead to a dramatic stalling of several unrelated signaling and cellular processes . The rate of these cellular processes decreased exponentially with protein density when approaching stalling osmotic compression . This suggests that , under compression , the cytoplasm behaves as a soft colloid undergoing a glass transition . Our results shed light on the physical mechanisms that force cells to cope with volume ﬂ uctuations to maintain an optimal protein density compatible with cellular functions . biophysics | HOG pathway | protein diffusion T he evolutionary adaptations of cells and organisms to speci ﬁ c environments are well characterized . Physiological adaptations to environmental variations are also important for cell survival and growth . Environmental challenges such as changes in temperature , pH , and osmolarity are known to alter cellular function . For ex - ample , temperature variations impact protein folding , the kinetics of biochemical reactions , and protein - binding speci ﬁ cities ( 1 ) . The balance of water activity is a critical requirement for a wide range of cellular functions ( 2 – 5 ) . On the one hand , a shift to a lower osmotic environment increases cell volume , threatening the in - tegrity of the cellular membrane ( 4 , 6 , 7 ) . To counteract such stress , bacteria and yeast are surrounded by highly resistant cell walls that mechanically protect them from bursting ( 4 ) . On the other hand , high osmolarity causes water ef ﬂ ux and cell shrinkage ( 4 , 8 ) . In yeast , osmotic shrinkage is completed within a few tens of seconds after exposure to increased osmolarity ( 9 ) . The ﬁ nal cell volume is set by the mechanical equilibration of external , internal , and turgor pressures ( 10 , 11 ) . Hyperosmotic stress alters a variety of cellular processes , such as disrupting the cytoskeleton structure ( 12 , 13 ) , inducing chromatin remodeling ( 14 , 15 ) , and triggering cell cycle arrest ( 16 , 17 ) and apoptosis ( 18 , 19 ) . The high - osmolarity glycerol ( HOG ) pathway of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Fig . 1 A ) orchestrates adaptation ( 20 ) to hyperosmotic shock to ensure water homeostasis and volume recovery , notably through glycerol production ( 4 , 21 ) . Several studies have provided a comprehensive , quantitative understanding of the dynamics of the HOG pathway ( 9 – 11 , 20 , 22 – 25 ) . Membrane sensors ( Sln1p , Msb2p , Hkr1p ) are activated by osmotic stress and induce successive phosphorylation of the HOG mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , culminating in dual phosphorylation of the Hog1p kinase ( 4 ) and leading to the Nmd5p - dependent nuclear import of Hog1p , which accumulates in the nucleus ( Fig . 1 A ) and orchestrates a large transcriptional response . One of the main physiological changes that occurs immediately after hyperosmotic stress is an increase in the intracellular protein concentrations and the total protein density , thus leading to mo - lecular crowding . This may alter the mobility , folding , stability , and association rates of several proteins inside the cell . Molecular crowding has received little attention in living cells , although it is usually invoked to explain why biochemical reactions rates may vary in vivo and in vitro ( 26 – 29 ) . For instance , the diffusion co - ef ﬁ cient of the green ﬂ uorescent protein is typically 10 times lower in cells than in vitro ( 30 ) . Cells are densely packed with proteins . An estimate in yeast gives a typical protein density of a few hundred grams per liter for a volume fraction of typically 20 – 30 % . Osmotically compressed cells will be even more crowded . However , the effects of increasing molecular crowding on cell signaling have not been experimentally investigated and are dif ﬁ cult to predict ( 1 , 26 , 28 ) . Increasing the protein concentration increases the probability of protein inter - actions and protein association rates and may lead to more rapid biochemical kinetics . However , the diffusion of proteins may be reduced in an overcrowded cytoplasm ( 31 , 32 ) , thus slowing down biochemical kinetics . Changing the cell volume by altering the osmotic pressure is a simple strategy to study the effect of increasing molecular crowding on active processes in living cells . Such strategy can be conveniently applied to yeast , and the HOG pathway is a natural candidate for study . The HOG pathway has been extensively studied in response to gentle and mild osmotic stresses ( < 1 M sorbitol ) . In such cases , the stronger the osmotic stimulation , the more potent and longerthe duration of Hog1p nuclear localization ( 4 , 11 , 20 , 24 ) . A preliminary hint of what happens under more severe osmotic stresses , and thus stronger compression , came from a study by Van Wuytswinkel et al . , who reported that Hog1p nu - clear import and phosphorylation were surprisingly delayed under severe osmotic stress ( 1 . 4 M NaCl ) ( 33 ) ; however , no satisfying explanation was given for this observation .

In this article , we set out to address the effects of osmotic compression on signaling dynamics by monitoring several signaling processes in yeast over a range of osmotic stresses . Results Both Phosphorylation and Nuclear Import of Hog1p Are Slowed Down During Severe Osmotic Compression . To study the dynamics of ac - tivation of the HOG cascade , we measured changes in the nuclear ﬂ uorescence of Hog1p - GFP yeast cells immobilized in a sealed gasket chamber ( Fig . 1 B ) . The environment of the cells was rapidly changed ( typically in less than 10 s ; Fig . S1 ) from normal yeast media to the same media supplemented with sorbitol . After 1 M sorbitol treatment , Hog1p became phosphorylated and was impor - ted into the nucleus within a few minutes ( Fig . 1 C – E ) . The cell volume immediately decreased after osmotic stimulation with 1 M sorbitol and then restored progressively over time ( Fig . 1 C ) . The dynamics of Hog1p nuclear translocation and phosphorylation under these conditions were very reproducible and in agreement with the literature ( 9 , 23 ) . We then studied the behavior of the HOG pathway in response to stronger osmotic stresses ( Fig . 2 ) . Both the time taken to observe Hog1p phosphorylation and the time needed to reach maximal Hog1p nuclear localization increased when osmotic compression increased ( Fig . 2 ) . Under gentle stimulation ( 1 M sorbitol ) , the maximum nuclear intensity was reached after ∼ 2 – 3 min , whereas for severe shock ( ∼ 1 . 8 M sorbitol ) , maximum nuclear intensity was reached after ∼ 55 min ( Fig . 2 B and F and Movie S1 ) . Thus , in - creasing the sorbitol concentration from 1 M to 1 . 8 M reduced the nuclear import rate of Hog1p by one order of magnitude . Similar results were obtained when using NaCl as an osmotic agent ( Fig . S2 ) . As the sorbitol concentration increased , the rate of Hog1p phosphorylation also reduced ( Fig . 2 D ) and correlated well with the time taken for nuclear localization of Hog1p to be observed ( Fig . 2 E and F ) . Note that Hog1p nuclear translocation was syn - chronously observed for all cells subjected to osmotic shock lower than 1 . 8 M sorbitol . However , the proportion of cells that displayed nuclear enrichment of Hog1p quickly decreased when the intensity of osmotic stress increased above 1 . 8 M sorbitol ( Fig . S2 ) . When exposed to 2 M sorbitol , only 25 % of the cells displayed nuclear localization of Hog1p , even after several hours of observation ; this effect was not related to cell death , because most cells remained viable even after several hours of osmotic treatment ( Fig . S3 ) . Timing of Hog1p Nuclear Import Is Correlated with the Decrease in Cell Volume . Cell volume decreased with increasing osmotic stress , reaching a plateau at around 40 % of the initial cell vol - ume for sorbitol concentrations above ∼ 2 M ( Fig . 2 C ) . This is in Fig . 1 . Dynamics of the HOG cascade . ( A ) HOG cascade . ( B ) Illustration of the sealed gasket chambers used to experimentally regulate the cells ’ en - vironment .

Data are represented as the mean of several cells ± 1 SD ( n > 20 ) . Cells progressively recovered their size and switched off the HOG cascade through negative - feedback loops . ( D ) Nuclear accumulation of Hog1p was rapid and robust after a 1 M sorbitol osmotic stress . ( E ) Phosphorylation levels of Hog1p after a 1 M sorbitol osmotic stress followed the same pattern with a rapid induction and then a slow decay . Typically , within 30 min , nuclear Hog1p was no longer observed , and Hog1p returned to basal phosphory - lation levels . Phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) was used as a positive control . Fig . 2 .

( B ) The rate of Hog1p nuclear translocation was reduced by severe osmotic shock ( red , 1 M sorbitol ; blue , 1 . 75 M sorbitol ) .

The delays in both Hog1p phos - phorylation and nuclear translocation correlated with the changes in cell volume : the smaller the cell volume ( measured immedi - ately after osmotic stress ) , the slower the dynamics of Hog1p phosphorylation and nuclear translocation ( Fig . 2 F ) . More pre - cisely , the timing of Hog1p activation displayed a divergent be - havior when the cell volume approached V / V max ≈ 0 . 4 ( Discussion and Fig . S4 ) . Diffusion of Hog1p Reduces in Osmotically Compressed Cells . We conducted ﬂ uorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments to investigate whether the reduced rate of Hog1p translocation in a crowded cytoplasm could be explained by a decrease in protein mobility . We used HOG1 - GFP pbs2 Δ cells ( Fig . 3 and Movie S2 ) . In a pbs2 Δ background , the HOG pathway is genetically disrupted , and Hog1p - GFP cannot be phosphory - lated or imported into the nucleus . FRAP experiments can thus be performed in any osmotic environment without triggering nuclear enrichment of Hog1p - GFP . We observed that the diffu - sion of Hog1p - GFP ( Fig . 3 and Movie S2 ) decreased with in - creasing osmotic compression . Fluorescence recovery took less than a second in isotonic conditions , and around 5 s after a gentle osmotic stress ( 1 M sorbitol ; Fig . S5 ) . We obtained a diffusion coef ﬁ cient of ∼ 15 μ m 2 · s − 1 in isotonic conditions and ∼ 1 . 7 μ m 2 · s − 1 after stress with 1 M sorbitol ( Fig . S5 ) . However , no recovery after photobleaching was observed after treatment with 2 M sorbitol ( Fig . 3 A ) , and it was not possible to quantify the diffusion coef ﬁ cient . Fluorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) experi - ments ( Fig . 3 D and E , Fig . S6 , and Movie S2 ) con ﬁ rmed this result : cells continuously bleached at the same location entirely lost their ﬂ uorescence in isotonic conditions , but not after a sud - den , severe osmotic stress . Similar results were obtained when using other ﬂ uorescently tagged proteins in a wild - type back - ground ( Fig . S6 ) . These results are also in good agreement with previous measurements of the effect of molecular crowding on diffusion ( 28 , 31 , 32 ) and indicate that severe osmotic compres - sion decreases the mobility of Hog1p . Nuclear Translocation of Msn2p Is also Delayed During Severe Hyperosmotic Compression . To further test whether the observed slowdowns in nuclear translation , phosphorylation and protein mobility were speci ﬁ c to components of the HOG pathway , we examined the dynamics of the nuclear translocation of Msn2p ( 34 – 36 ) , a key transcription factorinthegeneral stress response ofyeast . After hyperosmotic stress , Msn2p is hyperphosphorylated and imported into the nucleus ( 37 ) . Nuclear import of Msn2p is ach - ieved via a different mechanism to Hog1p ; Msn2p contains a nu - clear localization signal and does not interact a priori with Nmd5p ( 36 ) . Wenevertheless observed thesamescenario as forHog1p : the rate of nuclear translocation of Msn2p progressively reduced as osmotic compression increased ( Fig . 4 A and E and Movie S3 ) ; this effect was not dependent on alterations to the dynamics of Hog1p , as a similar behavior was observed in a hog1 Δ background ( Fig . S7 ) . Dynamics of the Nuclear Translocation of Yap1p , Crz1p , and Mig1p Are Delayed When Cells Are Osmotically Compressed . We further tested the nuclear - translocation dynamics of transcription factors that are not speci ﬁ cally activated by osmotic stress : Yap1p , Crz1p , and Mig1p ( Fig . 4 and Movies S4 , S5 , and S6 ) . Yap1p is involved in the oxidative stress response and contains a nuclear localization signal but is constantly exported from the nucleus by Crm1p ( 38 ) . The addition of 300 μ M hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) triggers oxidation of the cysteine residues in Yap1p , leading to a conformational change that blocks its nuclear export by Crm1p . Hence , Yap1p accumulates in the nucleus upon oxidative stress . The transcription factor Crz1p is a cytoplasmic protein involved in the regulation of calcium ion homeostasis . Upon stimulation with calcium , Crz1p is dephosphorylated and imported into the nucleus ( 39 ) . In the presence of glucose , Mig1p is dephos - phorylated by the Reg1p - Glc7p protein phosphatase complex and imported into the nucleus , where it binds to the promoters of glucose - repressed genes ( 40 ) . In the following experiments , the objective was to reduce the cell volume using severe hyperosmotic shock and , simultaneously , to activate andmeasure the nuclear translocationof these transcription factors . We applied a dual input of a severe hyperosmotic shock and a stimulus of either 300 μ M H 2 O 2 ( Yap1p ) , 200 mM Ca 2 + ( Crz1p ) , or 2 % ( wt / wt ) glucose , which were added to cells initially grown in galactose ( Mig1p ) . In isotonic conditions , Crz1p localized to the nucleus within a few minutes of the addition of Ca 2 + ( Fig . 4 B ) . This burst of nuclear translocation was delayed by several minutes when the cells were stimulated with Ca 2 + in combination with severe hyperosmotic shock ( 1 . 4 M sorbitol ; Fig . 4 B and F ) . Interestingly , Crz1p was also partially activated to undergo nuclear translocation by mild osmotic stress alone ( Fig . 4 B ) ; this effect may be attributable to variations in the internal calcium concentration following cell shrinkage . Note that when stimulated by a severe hyperosmotic stress alone , the dynamics of Crz1p nuclear translocation was also slowed down , in agreement with our hypothesis that increasing os - motic compression reduces the rate of intracellular signaling ( Fig . 4 B ) . Similarly , we observedamarkedreductioninthe rate ofnuclear import of Yap1p ( Fig . 4 C and G ) and Mig1p ( Fig . 4 D and H ) when the cells were both stimulated and osmotically compressed ; these slowdowns became more pronounced with increasing volumetric compression ( Fig . 4 J and Fig . S4 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that a nonspeci ﬁ c slowdown in the kinetics of nuclear translocation occurs when cellular volume is reduced through a se - vere osmotic compression . Dynamics of Endocytosis and Vesicular Traf ﬁ cking Are Reduced During Osmotic Shock . To gain further insight into the effect of osmotic compression , we investigated the effects of osmotic compression on the dynamics of three additional processes . We Fig . 3 .

Pictures are color - coded to improve visualization ( blue for low intensity and red for high intensity ) . Miermont et al . PNAS Early Edition | 3 of 6 S Y S T E M S B I O L O G Y ﬁ rst analyzed the mobility of the protein Abp1p , an actin - binding protein that dynamically partitions between the plasma mem - brane and endosomes under normal conditions ( 41 ) . After sudden and severe osmotic stress ( 3 M sorbitol ) , Abp1p patches suddenly stopped their random motion ( Fig . S8 and Movie S7 ) . We also examined Sec7p , which is involved in protein transport and is found in the cytoplasm and Golgi - associated coated vesicles ( 42 ) . The mobility of Sec7p was drastically impaired by osmotic compression ( Fig . S8 and Movie S8 ) . Finally , using a tracer of bulk endocytosis , the ﬂ uorescent dye FM4 - 64 ( 43 ) , we observed that the active internalization and transport of vesicles stalled after sudden osmotic compression ( Fig . S8 ) . Signaling Dynamics Quickly Recover When Cell Volume Is Restored . If the reductions observed in the dynamics of cell signaling were only attributable to a reduction incell volume , the cells should beableto recover their normal signaling activity upon the restoration of cell volume . Hence , we investigated signaling dynamics after the re - covery of cell volume , as illustrated in Fig . 5 A . Hog1p - GFP or Msn2p - GFP cells were subjected to a severe osmotic stress and then returned to a less hyperosmotic environment , to relax the osmoticcompression ( Fig . 5 B and C ) . Wedidnotreturnthecellsto isotonic conditions , because we wanted to determine whether Hog1p and Msn2p translocated to the nucleus , which does not happen in isotonic conditions . Whereas cells did not show any nuclear localization during the ﬁ rst 5 min of severe osmotic stress , marked , rapid localization of Hog1p and Msn2p became visible when the cells were returned to a less hyperosmotic environment ( 1 M sorbitol ) . Thus , the cells were still alive and could function properly as soon as the osmotic clamp was mechanically relaxed . Similar experiments were performed for Crz1p , Mig1p , and Yap1p ( Fig . 5 D – F ) . Initially , in the presence of severe osmotic stress , the cells did not display any localization activity for any of these path - ways . However , relaxation of the osmotic constraint led to the rapid activation of these pathways . Therefore , although decreasing the cell volume inhibited the signal - processing ability of the cells , their signal - processing ability was recovered as soon as the cell volume was restored . Discussion Taken together , our experiments demonstrate that severe os - motic compression drastically reduces the rate of several dynamic processes in living cells . Reducing the volume of yeast cells led to a lower diffusion coef ﬁ cient and slower rates of Hog1p phosphor - ylation and nuclear import . The dynamics of the nuclear trans - location of other transcription factors ( Yap1p , Crz1p , Msn2p , and Mig1p ) were similarly delayed by osmotic compression . Impor - tantly , release of the osmotic clamp on the cells led to a rapid re - covery of signaling . Each of the proteins tested is activated by a different process ( phosphorylation , dephosphorylation , and oxi - dation ) and undergoes nuclear import via a different mechanism , andyet the kinetics of theirnuclear translocation displayeda similar dependence on osmotic compression . In addition , the kinetics of actin - binding protein mobility , vesicular traf ﬁ cking , andendocytosis were also reduced by osmotic compression . These observations argue in favor of a general , nonspeci ﬁ c , physical slowdown process . The cytoplasm is a dense assembly of proteins in a liquid , namely a colloid . Interestingly , when a colloid becomes too dense , its relaxation dynamics are dramatically slowed down , and its vis - cosity increases dramatically . Similarly , if the cytoplasm becomes too crowded , it becomes very dif ﬁ cult for proteins to diffuse , and their mobility drastically reduces . Zhou et al . ( 44 ) recently dem - onstrated that higher eukaryotic cells behave as soft colloids : col - loids made of deformable particles . During the glassy transition of soft colloids , the viscosity diverges exponentially with the colloid volume fraction , ϕ ( 45 ) . Assuming that the diffusion coef ﬁ cient of a protein , D , scales as the inverse of the cytoplasmic viscosity , and that the rates of diffusion limited reactions scale with ϕ D , the Fig . 4 .

This scaling is in good agreement with our measurements ( see the ﬁ tting curve in Figs . 2 F and 4 J and Fig . S4 ) . This suggests that osmotically compressed yeast cells behave as soft colloids and undergo a glassy transition under too - severe compression . This also supports our hypothesis that osmotic compression leads to a decrease in the mobility of proteins in the cytoplasm , because of an increase in molecular crowding . Our results emphasize the importance of molecular crowding , induced by hyperosmotic compression in our experiments , in determining the kinetics of biochemical reactions within cells . Recently , Dill et al . ( 1 ) outlined that cellular function should be analyzed within the context of the mechanical and thermo - dynamic constraints exerted by the environment . Dill et al . argued that an optimal protein density must exist , which origi - nates from the competition between the two counteracting effects discussed at the beginning of this article : increasing molecular crowding enhances the rate of biochemical reactions but only up to the point where the negative effects of molecular crowding on protein diffusion become dominant . Our results in living cells support this view . We hypothesize that the size of cells was determined by evolution , so that cells usually function at a protein density that enables them to resist mild and sudden changes in osmolarity . Thus , the total protein density is likely to be smaller than the optimum proposed by Dill et al . , because cells with too high of a protein density would be at risk for the complete arrest of key cellular processes upon sudden osmotic shock : a behavior obviously not favored by evolution . Our results outline why the protein density , or the cell volume , must be regulated in order for cells to function properly . We propose that the effects of molecular crowding should be taken into account when considering the biological ( gene networks , sig - naling ) and physical ( cellular mechanics ) properties that con - strain cellular dynamics . Materials and Methods Yeast Strains and Maintenance . Cultures were maintained in YPD medium [ 1 % yeast extract ( Difco ; 0127 - 17 ) , 2 % Bacto Peptone ( Difco ; 0118 - 17 ) , 2 % glucose ( VWR ; 24379 . 294 ) ] or in Synthetic Complete ( SC ) medium ( 0 . 67 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids ; Fisher ; W1706W ) , 2 % glucose ( VWR ; 24379 . 294 ) , and 0 . 08 % Complete Supplement Mixture dropout mixture ( MP Biomedicals ; 114500012 ) . Cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in SC , reinoculated into fresh SC , and grown at 30 °C for 4 – 6 h before microscopy . See Tables S1 and S2 for details on the yeast strains . Details on the preparation of protein extracts and Western blotting are given in SI Materials and Methods . Sudden Osmotic Stimulation . Perfusion chamber gaskets from Invitrogen ( 4 chambers , 19 mm × 6 mm , 80 μ L ; C - 18128 ) were used as an inexpensive and simple system to switch the cells from one environment to another . A solu - tion of Con A ( 2 mg / mL ; MP Biomedicals ; 2150710 . 2 ) was added into the chamber , and , after 15 min of incubation , yeast cells were injected and allowed 10 – 15 min to adhere to the coverslip before starting the experiment . Microscopy and Image Analysis . The cells were observed using an Olympus IX81 inverted ﬂ uorescent microscope with a QuantEM 512SC camera and a 100 × / 1 . 40 NA immersion oil objective . GFP emission was visualized at 528 nm ( 38 - nm bandwidth ) upon excitation at 490 nm ( 20 - nm bandwidth ) ; mCherrywasvisualized at 617nm ( 73 - nmbandwidth ) upon excitation at 555 nm ( 28 - nm bandwidth ) . Images were acquired using MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices ) , and image analysis was performed with ImageJ ( 46 ) . The ﬂ uorescence intensity of transcription factors in the nucleus was obtained by measuring the intensity of GFP colocalized with the nuclear marker Htb2p - mCherry . We removed the background from the GFP channel ( rolling ball method with a radius of 200 pixels ) , applied a Gaussian blur ( 1 pixel ) to reduce noise , found a threshold to separate the cells from the background ( Otsu thresholding ) , and segmented the cells using the “ analyze particles ” and “ watershed ” plugins of ImageJ . We computed the relative nuclear intensity as [ GFP ( nucleus ) − GFP ( cytoplasm ) ] / GFP ( cytoplasm ) and renormalized all cells by subtracting the value for ﬁ rst measurement performed before osmotic compression . The area of the cell was measured by ﬁ tting ellipses to the contour of the cells . From the cell area , we com - puted the equivalent cell volume assuming that cells are spheres with Fig . 5 .

Cells are stressed and , at the same time , osmotically compressed by severe osmotic stress ( 3 M sorbitol ) .

We measured the relative volume for each cell using V / V max , in which V max is the volume of the cell before osmotic compression . FRAP and FLIP Experiments . FRAP and FLIP experiments were performed at the Nikon Imaging Centre of the Institut Curie . Experiments were per - formed at 30 °C on a total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted ﬂ uorescent microscope equipped with a QuantEM 512SC cam - era , and a 100 × 1 . 45 NA immersion oil objective . The emission ﬁ lter wavelength was 525 nm , and the excitation ﬁ lter was 470 nm . For bleaching , we used a 491 - nm pulse generated by a FRAP 4D module ( Roper ) . A cytoplasmic area of typically 2 μ m in diameter was photo - bleached by a 50 - ms laser pulse . A single focal plane was then recorded every 50 ms with a 50 - ms exposure time . FLIP experiments were per - formed using the same system ; however , the images were recorded every 250 ms . FRAP images were denoised using the ND - Sa ﬁ r software on 10 cells for each condition . This procedure , developed by Boulanger et al . ( 47 ) , improves the signal to noise ratio and is crucial for the quantitative analysis of FRAP data . Once denoised , the images were normalized by the ﬂ uorescence intensity of the bleached area just before the bleach . Ad - ditional FRAP experiments were performed using a spinning disk micro - scope at the Mechanobiology Institute of Singapore ( Fig . S6 C , D , F , and G ) . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank J .

They were collected by ﬁ ltration and then stressed with different sorbitol concentrations ( 1 – 2 . 5 M ) for the indicated time period . To prepare protein ex - tracts , cultures were rapidly suspended in 10 % trichloroacetic acid ( Sigma ; T0699 ) and maintained in ice for at least 10 min . Cells were centrifuged , and maximum supernatant was discarded to leave around 100 μ L in the tubes . Cells were broken by bead - beating the samples ( 10 min at 4 °C ) with glass beads ( 425 – 600 μ m ) ( Sigma ; G8772 ) . The samples were centrifuged , the supernatant was dis - carded , and the pellet was resuspended in SDS buffer ( 1 × NuPage buffer , 10 % β mercaptoethanol , and200 mMTris ) to a ﬁ nalvolume of 100 μ L . Samples were loaded on 10 % SDS / PAGE NuPage precast gel ( Invitrogen ; NP0315BOX ) in 1 × NuPagerunning buffer ( Invitrogen ; NP0001 ) and run at 180 V for 1 h . Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes ( Invitrogen ; LC2005 ) at 30 V at 4 °C overnight . Dual phosphorylation of Hog1p on Thr - 174 and Tyr - 176 was examined in a Western blot analysis using an anti - dually phosphorylated p38 antibody 1 : 1 , 000 ( Cell Signaling Tech - nologies ; 9211L ) , and the positive control was examined using phosphoglycerate kinase monoclonal primary antibody 1 : 1 , 000 ( Invitrogen ; 22C5D8 ) . Goat anti – rabbit - HRP secondary antibodies ( JacksonImmunoResearch ; 111 - 035 - 003 ) were usedata dilutionof 1 : 10 , 000 . Antibody binding was visualized using ECL - plus system ( Amersham ; GERPN2132 ) ina Fuji ﬁ lmLAS4000imagingsystem . Membranes were stripped between both primary antibodies using 62 . 5 mM Tris · HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) with 2 % SDS . Fig . S1 . Quick exchange of ﬂ uids in a gasket sealed chamber . Using a pipette at one inlet of the gasket and a paper ﬁ lter ( black area at the top ) at the outlet to generate a ﬂ ow , it is possible to replace the entire volume of liquid contained in the chamber within a few seconds . The actual time it takes to replace water ( light gray ) with a liquid containing a dye ( seen as a dark gray area rising vertically ) is of the order of 1 s ( there is 0 . 2 s between each images ) . A few additional seconds are required to get the pipette and the ﬁ lter correctly aligned with the inlet and outlet of the gasket chamber . In practice , one needs typically 10 s to complete this operation . Fig . S2 . Additional data regarding Hog1p slowdown by osmotic compression . ( A ) Both NaCl and sorbitol triggered similar slowdown of the HOG cascade when plotted as a function of the relative cell volume variation . ( B ) For mild osmotic stresses ( < 1 . 5 M sorbitol ) , all cells eventually displayed a Hog1p nuclear localization . However , there was an abrupt transition around 2 M sorbitol , above which almost no cells displayed Hog1p nuclear translocation , even after more than 2 h of observation . Fitting the data with a sigmoid gave a transition at around 1 . 9 M sorbitol , for which 50 % of the cells were not responsive . Miermont et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1215367110 1 of 12 Fig . S3 . Prolonged exposure to severe osmotic stress . ( A ) Cells can adapt to severe osmotic stress . Upon 1 . 8 M sorbitol stress , cells appears jammed at ﬁ rst . It took several hours for cells to eventually adapt and divide . We did not image cells for longer than ∼ 4 h ( the medium has to be changed very regularly to avoid artifacts caused by evaporation ) , and , thus , we did not observe cell adaptation and recovery for 2 M sorbitol shocks . However , cells can survive and adapt to such strong shocks as shown by colony - forming unit experiments . ( B and C ) We counted the number of colony - forming units on plates that were seeded after different period of exposure to 2 or 3 M sorbitol . In both cases , short exposure ( 5 min ) resulted in a high survival rate . For long exposure to 2 M sorbitol stress , the survival rate was of the order of 50 % . ( C ) The survival rate was much lower in the case of very severe 3 M sorbitol shock . ( D ) Therefore , we were careful not to let the cells stay for too long in 3 M sorbitol when we performed the experiments of volume compression and recovery shown in Fig . 4 . To illustrate its short - term effect on cell signaling , we applied a very severe stress ( 3 M sorbitol ) for increasing periods of time ( from 5 min to 3 h ) before changing the environment back to yeast synthetic medium supplemented with 1 M sorbitol . The average dynamics of nuclear translocation of Hog1 - GFP was slower and slower even if the proportion of responding cells was larger than 90 % for stress shorter than 1 h . After a too - long exposition to 3 M sorbitol ( > 1 h ) , cells were unable to recover and only very few cells showed some localization ( ∼ 15 % ) . It is tempting to hypothesize that the progressive loss of ef ﬁ ciency in Hog1p dynamics and cell death after a too - long exposure are attributable to the arrest of internal maintenance and homeostatic processes when cells are severely osmotically compressed . Miermont et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1215367110 2 of 12 Fig . S4 . Logarithmic plots of the signaling dynamics . This ﬁ gure is based on data shown in Figs . 2 F and 4 J . A and C show log ( T max ) and the corresponding ﬁ ts in function of the relative volume variation V / V max . B and D show log ( T max ) as a function of the relative protein density . The protein relative density , ϕ / ϕ max , is de ﬁ ned as the inverse of V / V max and normalized so that its maximum is 1 ( arbitrary choice ) . Assuming that the cytoplasm behaves as a soft colloid , one expects to observe an exponential increase of the viscosity with the protein density : η ∼ exp ( αϕ ) . Here , we do not have access to the viscosity . To link our measurements to the theoretical prediction of a soft colloid glassy transition , we assume that the diffusion coef ﬁ cient of proteins vary inversely proportionally to the viscosity [ as in Dill et al . ( 1 ) ] . Further assuming that the rates of diffusion limited kinetics scales as r ∼ D ϕ , we obtain T max ∼ 1 / r ∼ 1 / ϕ exp ( αϕ ) or , alternatively , T max ∼ V exp ( α ′ / V ) . The ﬁ t functions are in agreement with an exponential increase of the viscosity of the cytoplasm with the protein density as it would be the case for a soft colloid near a glassy like transition . 1 .

Miermont et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1215367110 3 of 12 Fig . S5 . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of Hog1p - GFP ; pbs2 Δ cells . ( A and B ) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments performed in Synthetic Complete ( SC ) medium . ( A ) Average pro ﬁ le of ﬂ uorescence recovery over six cells . ( B ) Transverse section of the averaged photobleached area for one cell , illustrating thesize of thebleached area . ( C and D ) Same results but for10 cells stimulated by a gentle osmotic shock ( SC supplementedwith1 M sorbitol ) . Note that in both conditions , the size of the bleached area is large enough ( ∼ 1 . 8 μ m theoretically , ∼ 2 . 4 μ m in practice ) to prevent ﬂ uorescence recovery to the initial ﬂ uorescence value [ 1 in arbitrary unit ( a . u . ) ] . It is then dif ﬁ cult to estimate with precision a diffusion coef ﬁ cient . To estimate the diffusion co - ef ﬁ cient , we ﬁ rst extracted the average Gaussian bleached ﬂ uorescent pro ﬁ le . Then we determined the characteristic time of diffusion ( τ ) from ﬂ uorescence recovery curves ( Fig . 3 and Fig . S3 ) . The coef ﬁ cient of diffusion , D , was then estimated by taking into account that particles will diffuse over the bleached area radius , w m , in the typical time τ with a diffusion coef ﬁ cient D = w m2 / 4 τ . From the FRAP data made in normal growth conditions ( SC medium ; Fig . 3 and Fig . S5 ) , we obtained τ = 0 . 091 s , w m = 2 . 4 μ m , and , thus , D = 15 . 8 μ m 2 · s − 1 . From the FRAP data made in SC supplemented with 1 M sorbitol , we found τ = 0 . 85 s , w m = 2 . 4 μ m , and , thus , D = 1 . 7 μ m 2 · s − 1 . We were not able to measure it for severe osmotic stress because diffusion was apparently stalled ( Fig . 3 and Fig . S6 ) .

( A ) FLIP data corresponding to the images shown in Fig . 3 C for a Hog1 - GFP , pbs2 Δ background . Whereas the ﬂ uorescence is quickly lost outside of the continuously bleached spot ( red curve ) in isotonic conditions , some ﬂ uorescence remains visible outside of the bleached spot when the cell is osmotically stressed with 2 M sorbitol ( black curve ; see also Fig . 3 ) . ( B ) FLIP data acquired on the ﬂ uorescent protein Ura1p - GFP ( isotonic conditions , red ; 2 M sorbitol stress , black ) . Severe osmotic stress led to a drastically reduced protein mobility ( see also E ) . ( C and D ) Image time series of a FLIP experiment using a URA1 - GFP strain . Note the green arrows that show that a residual ﬂ uorescence can be seen outside of the bleached area after a severe osmotic stress but not in isotonic conditions . ( E and F ) FRAP experiments using the Ura1p - GFP protein and the ﬂ uorescent protein yEcitrine constitutively expressed . The difference of dynamics between isotonic and hyperosmotic conditions is obvious . Images are taken before , immediately after , and 5 s after the bleach . The arrows show the approximate location of the bleach . Whereas the bleached spot recovers ( partially ) its ﬂ uorescence in isotonic conditions , there is no recovery of ﬂ uorescence for strongly osmotically compressed cells , and the bleached , dark spot remains as if ﬂ uorescent proteins were “ frozen . ” This again shows that there is a drastic loss of protein mobility in osmotically compressed cells . Miermont et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1215367110 5 of 12 Fig . S7 . Crz1p and Msn2p dynamics in a hog1 Δ background . ( A ) We measured Crz1p nuclear - translocation dynamics in a hog1 Δ strain ( black ) and compared it to a HOG1 strain ( yellow ) . ( B ) We also compared Msn2p nuclear - translocation dynamics in a hog1 Δ strain ( black ) and in a HOG1 strain ( green ) . Both ex - periments showed that the slowdown is more pronounced in a hog1 Δ strain when studied as a function of the sorbitol concentration . Because Hog1p is a key regulator of cell size regulation and cell wall integrity , it is likely that in a hog1 Δ strain , a difference in turgor , internal osmolarity , cell wall composition , or initial cell size may be responsible for a different osmotic compressibility . Importantly , the hog1 Δ mutant appears to behave as a HOG1 strain when plotted in function of the volume variation ( C and D ) . This is in agreement with our ﬁ ndings that pointed out the relevance of volume compression : the absolute value of the osmotic stress is not relevant here .

( A ) When Abp1p - GFP is observed by ﬂ uorescence , it displays a number of moving bright dots . As illustrated here , the effect of a sudden hyperosmotic compression is to freeze Abp1p motion . ( B ) Typical snapshot of Abp1p localization pattern ( Left ) . The punctuated pattern is lost when averaging over time ( 40 min ) , evidencing Abp1p diffusion ( Right ) . ( C ) Typical snapshot of Abp1p localization ( Left ; same cell as in B ) after an osmotic compression ( 3 M sorbitol ) . Because the cells are in a “ frozen state ” ( see Results ) , averaging over time does not change the localization pattern of Abp1p ( see also Movie S7 ) . ( D ) Sec7p is also a mobile protein that can be seen as bright dots in epi ﬂ uor - escence . ( E and F ) The dynamics of Sec7p - mCherry ( E ) were immediately arrested after osmotic compression by 3 M sorbitol ( F ) . See also Movie S8 . ( G ) En - docytosis can be observed in live cells using the membrane binding dye FM4 - 64 . ( H ) We observed vesicles formation and motion in normal condition ( green arrows point to a few examples ) . ( I ) After a severe osmotic compression ( 3 M sorbitol ) , no FM4 - 64 internalization was observed , and the endocytosis appeared as if jammed .
