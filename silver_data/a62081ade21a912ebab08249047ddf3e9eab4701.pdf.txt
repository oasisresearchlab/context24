1488 Research Article Introduction Although phosphoinositides represent a minor fraction of cellular phospholipids , they are integral components of membranes and are believed to play key roles in cell signaling , cytoskeletal organization , vesicular transport and ion - channel regulation ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Suh and Hille , 2005 ) . Among different phosphoinositide species , phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] has been implicated in functioning as a second messenger that regulates clathrin - mediated endocytosis of receptors as well as recycling of internalized receptors back to the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( Roth , 2004 ; Haucke , 2005 ; Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ; Hinrichsen et al . , 2003 ; Motley et al . , 2003 ) . Although such a role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in endocytosis and recycling has been supported by a number of genetic and biochemical studies , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has equally prominent roles as a cytoskeletal regulator and as a precursor for other second messengers , making it difficult to demonstrate that the observed effects of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 perturbations are direct . Long - term perturbations of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels might also cause changes in phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] , diacylglycerol and Ca 2 + second messengers that alter gene expression and thereby indirectly interfere with endocytosis and recycling . To overcome this limitation , we employed a rapamycin - induced hetero - oligomerization strategy to rapidly reduce the PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration within seconds . We and others have recently developed this method to test for a direct role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in ion - channel regulation ( Suh et al . , 2006 ) , recruitment of proteins with polybasic residues ( Heo et al . , 2006 ) , calcium signaling ( Varnai et al . , 2006 ) and endocytosis ( Varnai et al . , 2006 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . In this approach , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is rapidly dephosphorylated by chemically inducible targeting of Inp54p , a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - specific 5 (cid:2) phosphatase ( Tsujishita et al . , 2001 ) , to the PM . The addition of iRap , a rapamycin analog ( Inoue et al . , 2005 ) , causes dimerization of a PM - localized FKBP12 - rapamycin binding domain ( FRB ) and a cytosolic Inp54p phosphatase domain conjugated to CFP and FKBP ( CF - Inp ) ( Suh et al . , 2006 ) . Here , we use this strategy to dissect the role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 both in the internalization and recycling of transferrin receptors . We found that , although rapid reduction in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration induced a near complete block of transferrin receptor endocytosis , bulk - phase endocytosis was not inhibited . Furthermore , the reduction in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also enhanced the concentration of transferrin receptor at the PM , suggesting a preferential role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in regulating endocytosis over recycling . We further show that the clustering of transferrin receptors into coated pits is disrupted upon reduction of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reduction also dissociated the adaptor proteins AP - 2 , epsin and clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid protein ( CALM ) from the PM , which is consistent with a role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in regulating AP - 2 and possibly other adaptors in clustering transferrin receptors . Surprisingly , we found that this reduction in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration has only a weak effect on the dynamic assembly of clathrin at the PM , suggesting that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 regulation is less important for the formation of clathrin coats . Together , our study suggests that reduction in PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration , as expected to occur upon receptor stimulation , first suppresses the adaptor - mediated targeting of cargo to endocytic sites before Endocytosis and recycling of membrane proteins are key processes for nutrient uptake , receptor signaling and synaptic transmission . Different steps in these fission and fusion cycles have been proposed to be regulated by physiological changes in plasma membrane ( PM ) phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] concentration . Here , we use a chemical enzyme - translocation strategy to rapidly reduce PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels while monitoring clathrin - mediated endocytosis and recycling . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis blocked transferrin receptor endocytosis and led to a marked increase in the concentration of transferrin receptors in the PM , suggesting that endocytosis is more sensitive to changes in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 than recycling . Reduction of PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels led to a near complete dissociation of Adaptor protein 2 ( AP - 2 ) from the PM but had only a small effect on clathrin assembly . This argues that receptor - mediated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reduction preferentially suppresses AP - 2 - mediated targeting of cargo to endocytic sites rather than the assembly of clathrin coats or recycling of endocytic vesicles .

Results PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion blocks transferrin internalization We first confirmed that rapid PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis can be induced in HeLa cells , because we used this cell system for the study . Within seconds after iRap addition , CF - Inp translocated from the cytosol to the PM , whereas the PH - domain of PLC δ , which binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with high specificity and affinity ( Stauffer et al . , 1998 ) , dissociated from the PM , indicating a loss of PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 1A , B ) . iRap - induced PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion in HeLa cells caused a near complete inhibition of the internalization of Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin , consistent with a proposed role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Fig . 1C , D ) . In control experiments , cells expressing CF - Inp and treated with DMSO instead of iRap still internalized transferrin ( Fig . 1C , D ) . Furthermore , iRap - induced translocation of CF - Inp ( D281A ) ( Suh et al . , 2006 ) , a phosphatase - dead mutant of CF - Inp , had little , if any , effect on transferrin uptake ( Fig . 1C , D ) , suggesting that the inhibition of transferrin uptake by CF - Inp translocation is due to its 5 (cid:2) phosphatase activity rather than by a non - enzymatic effect of the inducible translocation system . We then determined whether this block in clathrin - mediated transferrin receptor endocytosis reflects a general suppression of membrane internalization . We investigated the effect of rapid PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion on fluid - phase endocytosis , a clathrin - independent process ( Nichols and Lippincott - Schwartz , 2001 ) . iRap - induced translocation of CF - Inp had no significant effect on the uptake of fluorescein - Dextran ( M r 10 , 000 ) , whereas it blocked the uptake of transferrin in the same cell ( Fig . 1E , F ) . This indicates that the requirement of PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is selective for clathrin - mediated endocytosis over fluid - phase endocytosis . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion increases transferrin receptor levels at the PM Recent studies suggest that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is involved not only in endocytosis but also in the recycling of endocytosed cargoes back to the PM ( Cremona and De Camilli , 2001 ) . For example , deletion of PIPKI γ , the major PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - synthesizing enzyme in the brain , leads to defects in synaptic vesicle recycling ( Di Paolo et al . , 2004 ) . In non - neuronal cells , the involvement of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the endosomal recycling pathway has been implicated from Fig . 1 . PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis disrupts endocytosis of the transferrin receptor , but not fluid - phase endocytosis .

Although these studies suggest that prolonged changes in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels cause defects in endosomal recycling , it can not be excluded that the observed effects on recycling are caused by indirect regulatory mechanisms or defects occurring elsewhere , not at the PM . We tested the role of PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the recycling process by reducing PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels after having loaded the endocytic compartments with fluorescently labeled transferrin . We incubated HeLa cells for 20 minutes with Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin before inducing PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis . Recycling of internalized transferrin receptors was monitored by the loss of internal Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin fluorescence as the ligand - receptor complex returned to the cell surface . PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis following transferrin uptake caused a partial block of the reinsertion of Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin fluorescence ( Fig . 2A , B ) . A fraction of Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin fluorescence appeared to accumulate both in endosomes and near the PM , suggesting that receptor - containing vesicles are less effective in fusing with the PM ( Fig . 2A ) . In control experiments , PM translocation of the CF - Inp ( D281A ) phosphatase - dead mutant had no effect on recycling . To assess the relative effect of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis on endocytosis versus that on recycling , we monitored the amount of transferrin receptors expressed at the cell surface . Using an antibody against the extracellular domain of the transferrin receptor , we found a 50 % increase in the amount of receptor expressed at the PM after Fig . 2 . PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis partially inhibits transferrin receptor recycling to the surface while fully suppressing AP - 2 α PM localization and targeting of transferrin receptor ( TfR ) to endocytic sites .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1491 Role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in receptor recycling 15 minutes of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis ( Fig . 2C ) . There was no further increase in antibody fluorescence intensity after 30 minutes of hydrolysis , indicating that the recycling was blocked after 15 minutes . Assuming that synthesis of new receptors is negligible within the time - scale of minutes , the concentration of surface receptors is a direct function of the ratio between the endocytosis and recycling rates . Thus , the net increase in the level of transferrin receptor at the PM upon PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis suggests that endocytosis and recycling have different sensitivities to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reduction . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 can therefore directly regulate the surface expression of transferrin receptor by first suppressing endocytosis before interfering with the recycling process . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion dissociates AP - 2 from the PM Because PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has an indispensable role for transferrin receptor endocytosis , we focused our investigation on the molecular mechanism by which PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 regulates this process . One proposed role of PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis is in the recruitment of endocytic components to sites of endocytosis . Previous studies suggest that proteins important for the assembly of clathrin - coated vesicles bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 preferentially over other phosphoinositides , and local increases in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 serve as a key step in promoting receptor assembly in clathrin - coated pits ( Krauss et al . , 2003 ; Doughman et al . , 2003 ) . An important mediator of this assembly process is AP - 2 , which binds to various endocytosed receptors , clathrin and clathrin - coated - vesicle - associated proteins ( Owen et al . , 2004 ) . Previous studies indicate that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays a role in the recruitment of AP - 2 to endocytic sites at the PM . Mutant AP - 2 with a deletion in the putative lipid - binding domain fail to localize to clathrin - coated pits ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ) . In vitro studies suggest that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for AP - 2 to interact with the endocytic cargo ( Honing et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , knockdown of phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5 - kinase I β , an enzyme that produces PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , leads to a reduction of membrane - localized AP - 2 ( Padron et al . , 2003 ) . Rapid depletion of PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with 1 - butanol or another inducible 5 (cid:2) - phosphatase translocation strategy was also shown to lead to a dissociation of AP - 2 from the PM ( Boucrot et al . , 2006 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . We used the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - specific Inp54p PM translocation system to confirm such a role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in AP - 2 PM targeting using immunofluorescence and live total internal reflectance fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . The distribution of AP - 2 α immunofluorescence observed in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - hydrolyzed cells was diffuse and cytosolic , in contrast to the punctate distribution near the PM observed in non - hydrolyzed control cells ( Fig . 2D ) . The ratio of the average fluorescence intensity of AP - 2 α near the PM versus that in the midsection of the cell provides a quantitative measure for the loss of PM association of AP - 2 α upon PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis ( Fig . 2E ) . We further confirmed this effect using live TIRF imaging of YFP - tagged AP - 2 μ 2 , a different component of the AP - 2 adaptor complex . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis caused a rapid dissociation of AP - 2 - μ 2 – YFP from the PM within seconds , and a near complete loss by ~ 3 - 4 minutes ( Fig . 2F ) . This finding that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reduction leads to dissociation of AP - 2 from the PM in less than 15 seconds supports the hypothesis that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is directly required for targeting of AP - 2 to the PM . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion prevents transferrin receptor clustering Because AP - 2 serves as an adaptor that directs receptors to clathrin - coated pits , we tested the effect of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis on transferrin receptor clustering . To visualize the localization of transferrin receptors at the PM , we incubated cells with Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin at 4°C to label surface transferrin receptors . At this temperature , internalization of the ligand - receptor complex is inhibited . In PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - hydrolyzed cells , we observed a uniform distribution of transferrin receptor compared with the punctate pattern observed in control cells ( Fig . 2G ) . This effect was analyzed quantitatively using linescan analysis . Transferrin fluorescence intensity linescans showed sharp peaks in DMSO - treated control cells , reflecting the clustered distribution of Fig . 3 . PM PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis significantly suppresses LDL receptor endocytosis and weakly suppresses PM localization of epsin and CALM adaptors . ( A , B ) Following treatment with either DMSO or iRap , cells expressing Lyn - FRB and CF - Inp were simultaneously assayed for internalization of DiI - labeled LDL and Alexa - Fluor - 488 - conjugated transferrin .

( C ) Antibody against CALM ( top row ) or epsin ( bottom row ) reveals PM - associated punctate localization in untransfected control cells but a more cytosolic distribution in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - depleted cells . Cells expressing Lyn - FRB and CF - Inp were treated with Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin for 5 minutes following a 1 - minute treatment with iRap . Dashed lines indicate the location of Lyn - FRB - and CF - Inp - expressing cells . Scale bars : 10 μ m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1492 transferrin receptors in clathrin - coated pits ( Fig . 2H ) . Linescans across PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - hydrolyzed cells lacked these peaks , reflecting a uniform distribution of transferrin receptors ( Fig . 2H ) . We also calculated the standard deviation of transferrin receptor intensity values within each linescan using normalized fluorescence . Standard - deviation values of transferrin intensity in linescans across PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - hydrolyzed cells were markedly smaller than those measured in control cells ( Fig . 2I ) . Thus , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required not only for targeting AP - 2 to the PM but also for the clustering of transferrin receptors into clathrin - coated pits . These findings support a model in which PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 targets AP - 2 to the PM and that PM - localized AP - 2 is required to direct transferrin receptors to clathrin - coated pits . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 regulates LDL receptor endocytosis We tested whether PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has also a role in regulating the endocytosis of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptors and endocytosis of the endocytic coat components CALM and epsin . Even though LDL receptors are mostly endocytosed by an AP - 2 - independent endocytic route , we found that its endocytosis was also suppressed by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis ( Fig . 3A ) . A comparison of the relative suppression of endocytosis of transferrin receptors versus LDL receptors is shown in Fig . 3B . Furthermore , antibodies against the alternative adaptor proteins epsin and CALM revealed a partial loss from the PM in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3C ) . This argues that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 regulates the endocytosis of a range of receptors , possibly by regulating , with different efficiency , different endocytic adaptors . Assembly of PM clathrin is only weakly affected by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion In addition to its role in targeting receptors to coated pits , AP - 2 has also been proposed to have a role in the assembly of clathrin coats Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 9 ) at the PM ( Gallusser and Kirchhausen , 1993 ; Shih et al . , 1995 ; Brodsky et al . , 2001 ) . We tested the effect of reducing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration on clathrin - coat assembly and disassembly at the PM using live TIRF imaging of YFP - tagged clathrin light chain ( CLC ) . We added Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin at the same time as iRap was added , and analyzed those cells in which transferrin uptake was significantly reduced . Surprisingly , iRap - induced translocation of CFInp led to only an approximately 20 % reduction in the average intensity of clathrin puncta detected at the PM , suggesting that much of the clathrin remains clustered at the PM when PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - levels were reduced after translocation of Inp54 ( Fig . 4A , B , supplementary material Fig . S1 ) . Under these conditions , reduction in the number of detectable AP - 2 - 2 μ 2 puncta was more than fourfold stronger compared to that of clathrin puncta ( Fig . 4C ) . Dynamic formation of new clathrin puncta was also still observed after iRap addition ( supplementary material Movie 1 ) . Furthermore , we did not observe a statistically significant change in the average lifetime of clathrin puncta upon hydrolysis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 52±3 seconds before iRap treatment , 47±3 seconds with iRap treatment ) ( Fig . 4D ) . An earlier study reported that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion with ionomycin , a strong activator of phospholipase C , or PM translocation of human 5 (cid:2) phosphatase nearly completely blocks clathrin assembly ( Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . We confirmed their findings that addition of ionomycin suppresses dynamic clathrin assembly ( supplementary material Movie 1 ) . A plausible explanation for the discrepancy between their results and ours is a higher degree of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion in their study resulting from the use of ionomycin or of the different 5 (cid:2) phosphatase enzyme system they used . It is in this context useful to mention that experimentally observed receptor - mediated reductions in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentrations are believed to be graded and typically incomplete ( i . e . Stauffer et al . , 1998 ) , and an important Fig . 4 . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis has a much smaller effect on clathrin assembly at the PM compared to its effect on dissociating AP - 2 adaptors .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1493 Role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in receptor recycling issue for understanding PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 signaling is whether different PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - regulated processes have different sensitivities to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Our study argues that physiological reductions in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 primarily act on adaptor proteins such as AP - 2 and thereby reduce the targeting of cargo to endocytic sites , whereas supramaximal reductions in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are needed to interfere with clathrin assembly or with receptor recycling back to the surface . Conclusion We conclude that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for transferrin receptor endocytosis , but not for fluid - phase endocytosis . Furthermore , although PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays a vital role in endocytosis , reductions in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 have less of an effect on receptor recycling back to the surface . This differential role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in endocytosis versus recycling leads to an increase in the amount of transferrin receptor in the PM following PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reduction . Furthermore , our results suggest that a primary role of physiological decreases in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 for endocytosis is a strong PM dissociation of adaptor complex AP - 2 , and a weaker PM dissociation of the adaptor proteins epsin and CALM . This is consistent with a model in which receptor - mediated increases or decreases in the concentration of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 control the PM localization of endocytic adaptors and thereby enhance or reduce the adaptor - mediated delivery of receptor cargo to endocytic sites . Based on our findings , the dynamic assembly of clathrin at the PM is much less affected by decreases in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration compared with the effects on AP - 2 , suggesting that physiological changes in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 regulate adaptor - mediated targeting of cargo to endocytic sites rather than clathrin assembly . Materials and Methods Cell culture , transfection and constructs HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC , and cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin - Glutamine at 37°C at 10 % CO 2 . Cells were plated on Costar 96 - well flat - bottom plates for epifluorescence microscopy . For confocal microscopy , cells were plated on 8 - well labtek coverslips ( Nunc ) . 24 hours after plating , cells were transfected with FuGENE6 ( Roche ) . All experiments were performed 18 - 20 hours after transfection . YFP - PLC δ - PH ( Stauffer et al . , 1998 ) , Lyn 11 - FRB , CFP - FKBP - Inp54p and CFP - FKBP - Inp54p ( D281A ) ( Suh et al . , 2006 ) constructs are previously described . Construct requests should be made to T . I . ( jctinoue @ stanford . edu ) . AP - 2 - μ 2 – YFP was a kind gift from Alexander Sorkin ( University of Colorado , CO ) and YFP - CLC was a kind gift from Juan Bonifacino ( NICHD , National Institute of Health , MD ) . Live microscopy CF - Inp and YFP - PLC δ - PH translocation was monitored by live imaging with a 40 (cid:3) objective ( Zeiss ) on a spinning - disk confocal microscope ( Nipkow Wallac system ) . Images were analyzed with MetaMorph 6 . 1 software ( Universal Imaging ) . Objective - based TIRF imaging of YFP - CLC and AP - 2 - μ 2 – YFP was performed with a NA 1 . 45 100 (cid:3) objective ( Zeiss ) on an inverted microscope ( Zeiss ) at 37°C . For each cell , YFP TIRF images were obtained every 15 seconds for 10 minutes , followed by addition of 5 μ g / ml Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin and 5 μ M iRap . After addition , YFP TIRF images were obtained every 15 seconds for 10 minutes or until complete dissociation was observed . Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated - transferrin uptake was imaged using epifluorescence at the end of each experiment . Internalization and recycling assays All internalization and recycling assays were performed at 37°C . Prior to the transferrin - internalization assay , transferrin present in serum was removed by two washes with DMEM ( with 25 mM HEPES , GIBCO ) . Cells were then incubated with 5 μ M iRap in DMEM - HEPES or 0 . 1 % DMSO in DMEM - HEPES . 1 minute later , Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin ( Invitrogen ) in DMEM - HEPES was added to the iRap or DMSO solution to a final concentration of 5 μ g / ml Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin . After 2 , 5 , 15 or 30 minutes , extracellular Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin was removed by ice - cold acid solution containing 0 . 2 M acetic acid and 0 . 5 M NaCl , followed by neutralization with DPBS ( GIBCO ) . Cells were then fixed with 4 % formaldehyde ( Ted Pella ) in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature . For the transferrin receptor recycling assay , cells were first washed twice with DMEM - HEPES , then incubated with 5 μ g / ml Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin for 20 minutes . Extracellular Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin was then removed with acid solution containing 0 . 2 M acetic acid and 0 . 5 M NaCl , followed by DPBS neutralization . Cells were then incubated in 5 μ M iRap or 0 . 1 % DMSO in DMEM - HEPES containing 50 μ g / ml holotransferrin ( Sigma ) . Cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS after 5 , 15 or 30 minutes . For both the internalization and recycling assays , Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin and CF - Inp / CF - Inp ( D281A ) fluorescence was imaged with a 20 (cid:3) objective ( Nikon ) on an automated epi - fluorescent microscope ImageXpress 5000A ( Molecular Devices ) . Fluorescence intensities of single cells were measured with the ImageXpress analysis software . For dextran and transferrin internalization , cells were first washed twice with DMEM and incubated with 5 μ M iRap in DMEM - HEPES or 0 . 1 % DMSO in DMEM - HEPES . 1 minute later , fluorescein - dextran ( Invitrogen ) and Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin in DMEM - HEPES were added to the iRap or DMSO solution to a final concentration of 10 mg / ml fluorescein - dextran and 5 μ g / ml Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin . After 20 minutes of uptake , extracellular Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin was removed by ice - cold acid solution containing 0 . 2 M acetic acid and 0 . 5 M NaCl , followed by neutralization with DPBS ( GIBCO ) . Cells were then fixed with 4 % formaldehyde ( Ted Pella ) in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature . DiI - LDL and transferrin internalization were performed similarly , with 5 μ g / ml DiI - LDL and 5 μ g / ml Alexa - Fluor - 488 - conjugated transferrin . Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin , fluorescein - dextran , DiI - LDL and CF - Inp / CF - Inp ( D281A ) fluorescence were imaged with a 63 (cid:3) objective ( Zeiss ) on the Bio - Rad Radiance 2100 Laser - scanning confocal system . Images were taken from the midsection of the cell . Parameters on camera and microscope were set so that no area was saturated , and the same setting was used to image all cells . Images were analyzed with MetaMorph 6 . 1 software ( Universal Imaging ) . The background fluorescence of each image was subtracted before analysis . Immunofluorescence To label surface transferrin receptors , anti - transferrin - receptor antibody staining was performed using live cells at 4°C to prevent receptor internalization . Cells were pre - incubated at 4°C in DMEM - HEPES for 10 minutes . Then , cells were immunostained with mouse anti - human CD71 in DMEM - HEPES with 1 % BSA ( 1 : 1000 ; BD Pharmingen ) for 45 minutes . Cells were then fixed for 10 minutes with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and stained with goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa - Fluor - 568 ( 1 : 1000 ; Invitrogen ) . Fluorescence was imaged with a 20 (cid:3) objective on ImageXpress 5000A ( Molecular Devices ) and fluorescence intensities of single cells were measured with the ImageXpress analysis software . To label intracellular antigens , cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 , followed by staining with mouse anti - AP - 2 α ( 1 : 1000 ; Calbiochem ) , goat anti - epsin - 1 ( 1 : 200 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , or goat anti - CALM ( 1 : 200 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) for 45 minutes in PBS with 1 % BSA . Secondary antibody staining was performed with Alexa - Fluor - 568 - conjugated or Alexa - Fluor - 488 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG in PBS with 1 % BSA ( 1 : 1000 ) . Confocal images were taken with a 63 (cid:3) objective ( Zeiss ) on the Bio - Rad Radiance 2100 Laser - scanning confocal system . Images were analyzed with MetaMorph 6 . 1 software ( Universal Imaging ) . The background fluorescence of each image was subtracted before analysis . The PM : cytosol ratio of AP - 2 α was measured by dividing the average fluorescence intensity measured from the bottom section of the cell ( near the PM ) with that measured from the midsection of the cell . Binding of fluorescently labeled transferrin on live cells Labeling of surface transferrin receptors with Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin was performed at 4°C to prevent internalization . After a 5 - minute incubation with either 5 μ M iRap or 0 . 1 % DMSO in DMEM - HEPES at 37°C , cells were washed with cold DMEM - HEPES and placed at 4°C for 10 minutes . Cells were then incubated with 5 μ g / ml Alexa - Fluor - 594 - conjugated transferrin in DMEM - HEPES for 30 minutes at 4°C , followed by fixation with 4 % formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 4°C . The PM section at the bottom of the cell was imaged with a 63 (cid:3) objective ( Zeiss ) on the Bio - Rad Radiance 2100 Laser - scanning confocal system . Linescan analysis Linescan analysis was performed with MetaMorph 6 . 1 software ( Universal Imaging ) . The background fluorescence of each image was subtracted before analysis . The intensity of transferrin fluorescence in each cell was normalized so that the average intensity was the same for all cells . Three random linescans were taken across the width of each cell . The width of the line was approximately 1 μ m . The standard deviation of the fluorescence intensity within each linescan was calculated . Puncta analysis MATLAB R2006b was used for puncta detection , intensity and lifetime analysis . For puncta detection , a gaussian filter was first applied to raw images , then local maxima corresponding to CCPs were detected . For puncta lifetime analysis , we used a tracking algorithm developed by John C . Crocker ( University of Pennsylvania , PA ) . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Statistics For Figs 1 , 2 and Fig . 3B , we analyzed between 30 and 200 individual cells for each time point and condition . For linescan analysis , we took three linescans from each cell and used between 13 and 40 cells for each condition . For live TIRF imaging , we analyzed eight cells for AP - 2 - μ 2 – YFP and CFInp54 translocation , nine cells for YFP - CLC with CFInp54 translocation and three cells for YFP - CLC with CFInp ( D281A ) translocation .
