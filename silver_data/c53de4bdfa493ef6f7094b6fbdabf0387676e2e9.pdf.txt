Vesicle formation during receptor - mediated endocytosis involves a complex protein machinery and additional proteins to control it . Although our understanding of this endocytic machinery has grown rapidly during the last decade , little is known about how it interconnects functionally with the cortical cytoskeleton underlying the plasma membrane . In lower eukaryotes such as yeast , genetic analysis con - nects the actin cytoskeleton to endocytosis . In mammalian cells , the link is not so convincing . Introducing actin - per - turbing drugs ( reviewed in Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) or mutant forms of the Rho family of small GTPases ( re - viewed in Ellis and Mellor , 2000 ) disrupts endocytosis in some cells types with some assays , but not in all cases ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ; Jackman et al . , 1994 ; Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ) . Clarification of the role of ac - tin in endocytosis would result if it were possible to iden - tify the molecular players involved and to discover how the proteins of the endocytic machinery are linked func - tionally to those of the actin cytoskeleton . In this review , we outline the potential roles of the actin cytoskeleton in the endocytic process and examine the experimental evi - dence for each . Possible Roles for the Actin Cytoskeleton in Endocytosis The endocytic process can be broken down into steps , membrane invagination , coated pit formation , coated pit sequestration , detachment of the newly formed vesicle , and movement of this new endocytic compartment away from the plasma membrane into the cytosol . Each step could involve the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 1 , a – e ) . Cytoskeletal components may localize the endocytic machinery to domains of the plasma membrane by provid - ing a physical barrier to its diffusion ( trapping ) or by direct association with components of the machinery ( anchor - ing ; Fig . 1 a ) . The lateral mobility of green fluorescent pro - tein ( GFP ) 1 - labeled clathrin - coated pits is increased upon treatment with the actin monomer sequestering drug la - trunculin B ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) suggesting the removal of a diffusion barrier . In the same study , coated pits formed many times at the same site ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . The concept that coated pit formation is initiated at specific and restricted sites was also implied by studies of synaptic vesicle recycling at the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction ( Fig . 1 f ; Roos and Kelly 1999 ) . Perhaps the sites of endocytosis are linked to the actin cy - toskeleton via multifunctional scaffolding proteins . The actin cytoskeleton could also deform or invaginate the plasma membrane , imposing a curvature on the planar membrane , which makes it easier for coating machinery to pinch off the membrane ( Fig . 1 b ) . Such invaginations , open to small extracellular molecules , but not large ones , were found to be the source of a class of small endocytic vesicles ( SLMVs or synaptic - like microvesicles ) seen in PC12 cells ( Schmidt et al . , 1997 ) , but actin has not so far been implicated in such invaginations . A third possibility is that the cortical cytoskeleton ( Fig . 1 g ) needs to be removed to allow endocytosis . The rigid cortical actin cytoskeleton has an inhibitory effect on membrane traffic ( Trifaró and Vitale , 1993 ) that could be overcome by an increase in local actin turnover ( Fig . 1 c ) . The immediate vicinity of clathrin - coated pits has been shown to be almost devoid of actin fibers ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ) . However , actin cannot be playing an exclusively negative role since , at the apical surface of polarized epi - thelial cells , endocytosis was inhibited upon actin depoly - merization ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ) , whereas stabilizing actin filaments with jasplakinolide had no effect . Jasplakinolide neither inhibited nor stimulated endocytosis at the apical surface , but stimulated basolateral uptake ( Shurety et al . , 1998 ) . A fourth potential function of the actin cytoskeleton in - volves the membrane fission event that liberates vesicles from the plasma membrane . When actin polymerization is inhibited in A431 cells by the drug latrunculin A , receptor - mediated endocytosis is arrested at the stage of invagi - nated coated pits ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , it is possible that actin polymerization at the neck provides the force to drive membrane fission or vesicle detachment ( Fig . 1 d ) . Recent actin - depletion studies ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ) ar - gue against a role of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in the sealing of invaginated vesicles ; detachment of clathrin - coated vesicles from the plasma membrane , however , was not measurable in the assay used . Actin may also help drive detached endocytic vesicles Address correspondence to Britta Qualmann , Department of Neuro - chemistry and Molecular Biology , Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology , Postfach 1860 , D - 39008 Magdeburg , F .

Links between Endocytosis and Actin Cytoskeleton F113 through a viscous cytoplasm ( Fig . 1 e ) . In support of this concept , endosomes , pinosomes , clathrin - coated , and se - cretory vesicles have recently been described associated with actin comet tails in the cytoplasm ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Merrifield et al . , 1999 ; Rozelle et al . , 2000 ) , as have endosomes and lysosomes in in vitro systems ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . These comet tails ( Fig . 1 h ) resemble a mecha - nism that propels pathogens such as Listeria monocytoge - nes through the cytoplasm of infected host cells . Later stages of endocytosis could also involve actin - based motor proteins ( reviewed in Wu et al . , 2000 ) . Assuming an F - actin orientation similar to lamellipodia and filopodia , with the fast - growing barbed ends directed towards the plasma membrane , pointed end - directed motor proteins would be required . Recently , the unconventional myosin VI was re - ported to move towards the pointed end of actin filaments ( Wells et al . , 1999 ) . The ways in which the actin cytoskeleton may partici - pate in endocytosis ( Fig . 1 , a – e ) are not mutually exclu - sive , nor need they be found in all cell types and in all forms of plasma membrane vesiculation . Mammalian Proteins at the Functional Interface of Actin Organization and Endocytosis Dynamin and Its Isoforms Dynamins have been a focus of the endocytosis research since it was demonstrated that the block of endocytosis in the shibire mutant of Drosophila is due to a mutation in dynamin . This large GTPase controls the fission reaction ( reviewed in Sever et al . , 2000 ) . Some observations link dynamin to the actin cytoskeleton . When the dynamin K44A mutant , which is defective in GTP binding and blocks endocytosis , is overexpressed the distribution of ac - tin stress fibers and cell shape are altered . Since these changes can also be observed during an endocytosis block induced by K 1 - depletion or acidification they may be sec - ondary to the endocytosis defect ( Damke et al . , 1994 ; Al - tankov and Grinnell , 1993 ) . Treatment of primary hippo - campal cultures with antisense oligonucleotides to dynamin 1 inhibited neurite outgrowth , an actin - associated process , although again this could be secondary to an endocytosis block ( Torre et al . , 1994 ) . Dynamin 2aa - GFP was shown to colocalize with filamentous actin at membrane ruffles ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamin 2aa immunoreactivity was also detected at podosomes , cell adhesion structures consisting of actin arrays which often surround a narrow tubular membrane invagination . Overexpression of a GFP - dyna - min 2aa mutant similar to the shibire mutant of Dro - sophila abolished podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) . Since another construct , GFP - dynamin2aa K44A , can block en - docytosis , but not podosome formation ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , it can be concluded that the actin rearrangements that occur are not due to secondary effects of an endocyto - sis block , but that a direct functional link of dynamin to the actin cytoskeleton exists . Dynamin - interacting Proteins Dynamin - interacting proteins recognize the COOH - termi - nal proline - rich domain of dynamin most often via their SH3 domains . Since binding of their SH3 domains can lead to a strong activation of the GTPase activity of dynamin in vitro , dynamin - interacting proteins can additionally be viewed as putative regulators of dynamin . One class of dynamin - interacting proteins with SH3 do - mains consists of amphiphysins I and II ( reviewed in Wigge and McMahon , 1998 ) . Amphiphysin interacts with AP2 and clathrin , as well as with dynamin , and was proposed to be involved in targeting dynamin to the plasma mem - brane . Overexpressing the SH3 domains of amphiphysin I and II reduced receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Wigge et al . , 1997 ; Owen et al . , 1998 ) . Amphiphysin I and II SH3 domains are also known to prevent dynamin ring forma - tion ( Owen et al . , 1998 ) . Treatment of primary hippocam - pal cultures with antisense oligonucleotides to amphi - physin I did not affect receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis , but did inhibit neurite outgrowth and induced a collapse of growth cones ( Mundigl et al . , 1998 ) . In this case , growth inhibition is unlikely to be secondary to en - docytosis perturbations , because no changes in endo - cytosis were detected . Mundigl et al . ( 1998 ) were not able to show a direct interaction of amphiphysin I with G - or F - actin ; therefore , this effect may involve currently un - known actin - regulating proteins . A second family of dynamin - interacting proteins , which has been found to exhibit functional links to the actin cy - toskeleton , are the syndapins ( Qualmann et al . , 1999 ; Qual - mann and Kelly , 2000 ) . Genes of mouse orthologs of syn - dapins were also described and termed PACSINs ( Ritter et al . , 1999 ) . Whereas syndapin I is a brain - specific protein , syndapin II isoforms show a broader tissue distribution . Both forms of this SH3 domain - containing protein interact with dynamins , synaptojanins , and synapsins , all proteins that are involved in membrane trafficking . Additionally , syndapins interact with N - WASP , a more ubiquitously ex - pressed , brain - enriched isoform of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein , a potent activator of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex actin polymerization machinery ( Qualmann et al . , 1999 ; Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ) . In line with their pro - tein associations , syndapins affect both endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton . The SH3 domain of both syndapin isoforms inhibited receptor - mediated internalization of transferrin in vivo ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ) at a step that occurs after constricted pit formation , as demon - strated in an in vitro reconstitution system ( Simpson et al . , 1999 ) . These results are consistent with the fact that syndapins interact with dynamin . Overexpression of full - length syndapins had a strong effect on cortical actin or - ganization , inducing filopodia . This phenotype appears to be mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex at the cell periphery because it was completely suppressed by coexpression of a cytosolic COOH - terminal fragment of N - WASP ( Qual - mann and Kelly , 2000 ) . Whereas overexpressing the SH3 domain alone was sufficient to block endocytosis , the full - length protein was necessary to induce filopodia , suggest - ing that syndapin - induced cytoskeletal rearrangements are not an indirect consequence of the inhibition of receptor - mediated endocytosis . Syndapins also localized to sites of high actin turnover , such as filopodia tips and lamellipo - dia , and a splice variant of a chicken ortholog of syndapin , FAP52 , was described as focal adhesion protein ( Mer - iläinen et al . , 1997 ) . Syndapins could thus couple actin po - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 F114 lymerization to dynamin’s function in the fission reaction . They may be able to trigger a burst of actin polymerization around the vesicle neck that is required to detach the newly formed vesicle from the membrane or to move it into the cytosol ( Fig . 1 , d and e ) . In similar tails formed by the pathogen Listeria moncytogenes , actin filaments are oriented with their barbed , fast growing ends towards the vesicle and WASP proteins are also localized to this inter - face . To fulfill such a role , syndapins , however , would have to use the same SH3 domains to interact with both dy - namin and N - WASP . Since syndapins have oligomeriza - tion domains and other protein interaction interfaces , si - multaneous interactions may well be possible or additional proteins may be involved . Alternatively , these interactions may be more dynamic and dynamin rings may increase the local concentration of the syndapins . Proteins that Interact with the Endocytic Machinery and the Actin Cytoskeleton In many cases , both endocytosis and actin filament organi - zation in yeast are sensitive to perturbations in the same gene products . Recently , mammalian homologues of two such bifunctional yeast proteins , Abp1 and Sla2p , have been identified . The mammalian Sla2 homologue , HIP1R ( Huntingtin interacting protein 1 - related ; Seki et al . , 1998 ) , has been shown to be stably associated with clath - rin - coated pits and vesicles ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ) . The subcellular distribution of HIP1R overlaps with clathrin both at the cell cortex and in the perinuclear re - gion . GFP - HIP1R fusion proteins in living cells behave like clathrin - GFP , associating with newly formed coated pits and vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane ( Eng - qvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ; Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . The COOH - terminal talin - like domain of HIP1R binds F - actin in vitro and is important for the colocalization of the pro - tein with cortical actin in vivo , whereas the association with clathrin - coated pits is mediated by the NH 2 - terminal half of the protein ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ) . HIP1R might therefore represent a physical link between F - actin and clathrin - coated endocytic structures , a func - tion that may be required for spatial organization of en - docytosis ( Fig . 1 a ) , for an actin - dependent movement of newly formed coated vesicles ( Fig . 1 e ) , or both . Thus far , mainly the cytoskeletal interactions of the mouse homologue of yeast Abp1 , mAbp1 , have been char - acterized . mAbp1 specifically binds to F - actin in vitro and in vivo using two different functional domains and is pref - erentially associated with dynamic actin structures ( Kes - sels et al . , 2000 ) . Its involvement in actin dynamics is also suggested by the fact that mAbp1 , primarily a cytosolic protein , accumulates in lamellipodial areas of cell growth and in lamellipodial sheets of spreading and moving cells ( Kessels et al . , 2000 ) . This function is dependent on the GTPase Rac1 . mAbp1 , initially named SH3P7 ( Sparks et al . , 1996 ) , was also identified as a Src kinase substrate ( Lock et al . , 1998 ; Larbolette et al . , 1999 ) . We have re - cently discovered that the mAbp1 SH3 domain interacts with dynamin in vitro and in vivo , and that overexpression of the COOH - terminal SH3 domain of mAbp1 leads to a drastic reduction of the receptor - mediated endocytosis in vivo ( Kessels , M . M . , Å . E . Y . Engqvist - Goldstein , D . G . Drubin , and B . Qualmann , unpublished results ) . Thus , mAbp1 can bind to the endocytic machinery via its SH3 domain and to the actin cytoskeleton via its two NH 2 - terminal actin - binding modules and may therefore physi - cally link the endocytic machinery to the cortical F - actin ( Fig . 1 a ) . It could also participate in the proposed initia - tion of actin tail formation , coordinating it temporally and spatially with dynamin function ( Fig . 1 d ) , or may also function within the putative actin tails of endocytic vesi - cles ( Fig . 1 e ) . The members of the family of WASPs are all multido - main proteins essential for the regulation of actin dynamics in a variety of species . Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome patients show a decrease in the number of microvilli and abnormal pattern of actin filaments in platelets and lymphocytes ( re - viewed in Snapper and Rosen , 1999 ) . WASPs greatly en - hance the ability of the Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate actin filaments ( reviewed in Welch , 1999 ) , binding Arp2 / 3 via the extreme COOH terminus of WASP ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . The ubiquitous , but highly brain - enriched rela - tive of WASP , N - WASP , is activated by phosphatidylinosi - tol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate and Cdc42 binding ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) , and induces extremely long actin microspikes when coexpressed with active Cdc42 ( Miki et al . , 1998 ) . Mam - malian WASPs and the yeast homologue Las17 are addi - tionally implicated in endocytosis . EGF treatment of COS7 cells induced N - WASP to form a complex with the EGF receptor , most likely via the adaptor protein Grb2 ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . Lymphocytes from WASP knockout mice exhibited both a reduction in actin polymerization and defects in T cell receptor endocytosis ( Zhang et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , in brain extracts , N - WASP is associ - ated with syndapin I ( Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) , which is likely to play a role in receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Simpson et al . , 1999 ; Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ) . A spe - cific recruitment of N - WASP to the dynamin neck of a constricted pit could allow an N - WASP – promoted local F - actin assembly , first supporting the pinching - off process and subsequently leading to propulsion of the vesicle through the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1 , d and e ) . In support of this hypothesis , Taunton et al . ( 2000 ) reported that endosomal and lysosomal vesicles moved via actin propulsion in cell - free Xenopus laevis extracts . These vesicles exhibited N - WASP staining at the interface of the actin tail and the vesicle ( Fig . 1 h ) . Actin is a slow ATPase , and the nucleotide exchange re - action is an important point of regulation . The ADP / ATP exchange of actin is catalyzed by the small G - actin binding protein profilin , which is an important promoter of actin dynamics in vivo ( reviewed in Schluter et al . , 1997 ) . Profi - lins also bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex and to polyproline stretches of the WASP and family proteins ena / VASP . The brain - enriched profilin II isoform was recently shown to be able to interact with dynamin and synapsins by affin - ity chromatography , suggesting a role for profilin II in membrane trafficking events in the brain ( Witke et al . , 1998 ) . In a perforated PC12 cell system , the addition of re - combinant profilins I and II to diluted cytosol stimulated the biogenesis of synaptic - like microvesicles ( Schmidt and Huttner , 1998 ) . The ability of profilins to enhance nucle - otide exchange on actin can be regulated by phosphoino - sitides . The binding of phosphoinositides to profilin causes Qualmann et al . Links between Endocytosis and Actin Cytoskeleton F115 actin to dissociate from profilin . Witke et al . ( 1998 ) sug - gested a model in which profilin recruits both actin and potential ligands to phosphoinositide - rich membrane ar - eas and thus facilitates the spatially coordinated accumula - tion of signaling molecules , endocytosis machinery pro - teins , and nascent actin polymerization ( Fig . 1 , a , d , and e ) . Phosphoinositides directly affect signaling processes , membrane trafficking events , and the actin cytoskeleton ( reviewed in De Camilli et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1998 ) . The polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin 1 ( McPher - son et al . , 1996 ) , which catabolizes PIP 2 and PIP 3 ( Wo - scholski et al . , 1997 ) , and interacts with several SH3 domain - containing accessory proteins implicated in clath - rin - mediated endocytosis , may therefore be another at - tractive candidate to act at the interface of endocytosis and actin dynamics . Synaptojanin 1 plays a role in the un - coating of endocytic coated vesicles . In neurons of synap - tojanin 1 - deficient mice , clathrin - coated vesicles accumu - late in nerve endings and synaptic depression during prolonged high - frequency stimulation is enhanced ( Cre - mona et al . , 1999 ) . Considering the pleiotropic roles of phosphoinositides , the cellular function of synaptojanin might not be limited to the regulation of membrane traffic . A decrease in the amount of PIP 2 , a potent regulator of ac - tin - binding proteins , is believed to lead to local actin depo - lymerization ( see Sakisaka et al . , 1997 ) . Synaptojanin has been shown to be able to hydrolyze PIP 2 that is bound to actin - binding proteins such as profilin , cofilin , and a - acti - nin in vitro . In COS - 7 cells , overexpression of synaptoja - nin , but not a phosphatase - negative mutant , caused rear - rangement of stress fibers ( Sakisaka et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , synaptojanin might promote local actin turnover ( Fig . 1 c ) and uncoating in parallel , or vesicle uncoating may be co - ordinated temporally with the depolymerization of vesi - cle - associated actin . Perspectives In this review we propose that several proteins that inter - act with components of the endocytic coat or with dy - namin , even the GTPase dynamin itself , directly or indi - rectly affect actin cytoskeletal organization . An important remaining question is whether these proteins mediate both endocytosis and the actin organization in parallel , or whether their function in endocytosis requires their inter - action with the cortical actin cytoskeleton . The actin cy - toskeleton has been implicated in endocytosis for many years , but we have had few clues to the underlying mecha - nism . Several hypotheses are plausible ( Fig . 1 ) , but we do not know which one , or even if more than one , will be val - idated by further experiments . Indeed , the complexity of the results obtained with actin stabilizing and destabilizing drugs may be explained if actin has both inhibitory and fa - cilitatory actions . The situation is rapidly clarifying because of the avail - ability of dominant negative fragments of endocytic ma - chinery and actin cytoskeleton proteins . At the same time , in vitro assays of budding and observations of budding in real time of GFP - labeled vesicles offer unprecedented op - portunities to dissect out the steps of endocytosis . Actin and endocytosis studies are clearly engaged to each other ; the final marriage can be expected soon . The authors would like to thank Jack Roos , John E .
