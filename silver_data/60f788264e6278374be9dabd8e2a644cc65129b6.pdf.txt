B . MANN AND D . R . WHITNEY Ohio State University 1 . Summary . Letx and ybe two random variableswith continuous cumulative distribution functions f and g . A statistic U depending on the relative ranks of the x ' s and y ' s is proposed for testing the hypothesisf = g . Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin , December , 1945 , but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic . Under the hypothesis f = g the probability of obtaining a given U in a sample of n x ' s and m y ' s is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving n and m . Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of U for samples up to n = m = 8 . At this point the distribution is almost normal . From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean , variance , and fourth moment are obtained . The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m , n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner . The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives f ( x ) > g ( x ) for every x . 2 . Introduction . Let x and y be two random variables having continuous cumulative distribution functions f and g respectively . The variable x will be called stochastically smaller than y if f ( a ) > g ( a ) for every a . We wish to test the hypothesis f = g against the alternative that x is stochastically smaller than y . Such alternatives are of great importance in testing , for instance , the effect of treatments on some measurement . One may think of x as the values of certain measurements in the control group and of y as the values of the same measurement in a group which received treatment . In a particular instance the protective effect against infection by certain bacteria was investigated . Two groups of rats were used in the experiment . The first group receiving no treatment , the second group receiving the drug . Both groups were then infected with supposedly equally diluted cultures of the bacteria under investigation . Most of the rats in both groups died , but the time of survival was measured and it was desired to test whether the drug had the effect of prolonging the life of the rats . It was desired to make inferences from the effect on rats to the effect the drug would have on humans . Thus , the only relevant alternative to the hy - pothesis that survival times are not infltenced by the drug is that the survival time of those rats which received treatment is stochastically larger than that of the control group . 50 A TEST 51 3 . The U test . Let the quantities xl , * * * , x " , y / , * , ym be arranged in order . This arrangement is unique with probability 1 if P ( xi = yi ) = 0 and this follows from our assumption of continuity . Let U count the number of times a y precedes an x . If P ( U < U ) = a under the null hypothesis , the test will be considered significant on the significance level a if U < U and the hypothesis of identical distributions of x and y will be rejected . This test was first proposed by Wilcoxon [ 1 ] . His statistic T is the sum of the ranks of the y ' s in the ordered sequence of x ' s and y ' s . In general U = mn + m ( m + 1 ) _ T and this gives a simple way of computing U . Wilcoxon , however , treated only the case m = n and in this case he tabulated only 3 points of the distribution of T . Since the test seems of great utility it seemed worthwhile to compute the variance , the moments and the limit distribution of U and to investigate the class of alternatives with respect to which the test is consistent . Although this paper is written in terms of U and the probabilities of U are tabulated the results can be easily interpreted in terms of T if so desired . 4 . The distribution of U . Consider now ordered sequences of n x ' s and m y ' s . Since it is only the relation between x and y that matters we replace each x by a 0 and each y by a 1 . Let U count the number of times a 1 precedes a 0 . Let pnm ( U ) be the number of sequences of n O ' s and m l ' s in each of which a 1 precedes a 0 U times . By examining a sequence with the last term omitted we arrive at the recurrence relation : XWnm ( U ) = wpn - im ( U - m ) + p - nm - i ( U ) , where pij ( U ) = 0 if U < 0 and pio ( U ) , poi ( U ) are zero or one according as U P Oor U = 0 . Under the null hypothesis each of the ( m + n ) ! / m ! n ! sequences of n O ' s and n l ' s is equally likely . Consequently if pnm ( U ) represents the probability of a sequence in which a 1 precedes a 0 U times then ( 1 ) Pnm ( U ) = pn - lm ( U - M ) + Pnm 1 ( U ) . n + m n + m - Using the recurrence relation ( 1 ) the probabilities pnm ( U ) have been tabulated for m < n < 8 ( see Table I ) . For m = n = 8 the distribution of U - ' ( nm + 1 ) differs only a negligible amount from the normal distribution . We shall , in the following , derive the mean , the variance , and the fourth moment of U , and prove that the limit distribution of U is normal if n and m both approach infinity in any arbitrary manner . It is obvious that pnm ( U ) = pmn ( U ) . Since the probability of the ith 1 preceding the jth 0 is 4 , we have ( 2 ) En , m ( U ) = nm / 2 . 52 H . B . MANN AND D . R .

After multiply - ing ( 1 ) by ( U - nm / 2 ) 2 , using Enm ( U2 ) = - nm / 2 ) 2pnm ( U ) u and expanding : ( 3 ) Enm ( U2 ) n EnEb _ lm ( ul ) + + m En1fi _ ( U2 ) + nm / 4 , n n + m n + m where Enm ( u ) denotes the expectation of ( U - nm / 2 ) in sequences with n O ' s and m l ' s . The initial conditions of ( 3 ) are seen by direct calculation to be ( 4 ) Eno ( u2 ) = Eom ( U2 ) = 0 . By substitution Enm ( U2 ) = nm ( n + m + 1 ) / 12 is a solution of the recurrence relation ( 3 ) and its initial conditions ( 4 ) . Hence , it follows by mathematical induction that ( 5 ) Enm ( U2 ) = nm ( n + m + 1 ) / 12 . The fourth moment is similarly a solution of the recurrence relation ( 6 ) Enm ( u 4 ) = En _ im ( U4 ) + m Enm _ - ( U4 ) n + m n + m + - ( 2n m + 2nm2 - n2 _ m2 - nm ) 16 which is obtained from ( 1 ) by multiplication by ( U - nm / 2 ) 4 and expansion . The initial conditions of ( 6 ) are found by direct calculation to be ( 7 ) Eno ( u4 ) = Eom ( u4 ) = 0 . It may be verified that ( 8 ) Enm ( U 4 ) = nm ( n + m + 1 ) ( 5n2m + 5nm2 - 2n2 - 2m2 + 3nm - 2n - 2m ) 240 satisfies the recurrence relation ( 6 ) and its initial conditions ( 7 ) and hence ( 8 ) follows by mathematical induction . To investigate the limit distribution of u as n , m become infinite we investigate the rth moment . Following the same procedure as in the case of the second and fourth moments and using the symmetry of the distribution to find the odd moments zero we get the following recurrence relation . ( 9 ) Enm ( U2 ) = 4 Em ( ) 2r + { nm2a Enm ( U2r - 2a ) + mn2a Enm ( U2r - 2a ) } For r = 1 , 2 it is known that Enm ( U2r ) is a polynomial in n and m of degree 3r and that it is divisible by nm ( n + m + 1 ) . Assuming that Enm ( U2a ) , a < r is a polynomial in n and m of degree 3a divisible by nm ( n + m + 1 ) we will 56 H . B . MANN AND D . R . WHITNEY show that it is possible to find a polynomial of degree 3r in n and m divisible by nm ( n + m + 1 ) which satisfies the recurrence relation ( 9 ) for Enm ( U2r ) and also its initial conditions , namely , E0o ( u2r ) = Eom ( u2r ) = 0 . The last condition is trivially satisfied if Enm ( U2r ) is divisible by nm ( n + m + 1 ) . Our method here is to actually substitute a polynomial with undetermined coefficients into ( 9 ) and show that the coefficients can be obtained uniquely . Rearranging ( 9 ) we obtain Enn ( U2r ) n En1im ( U2r ) - m Enm - 1 2r ) ( 10 ) n + m n + m ( 0n 4 m l { nm2 EnIm ( 2rU2a ) + mnE2a Enmtl ( U2r2a ) Since for X < r we can write Enm ( U2X ) = nm ( n + m + 1 ) P3x - 3 where P3m3 iS a polynomial in n , m of degree 3X - 3 the above equation reduces to ( 11 ) Enm ( u2r E En - 1M ( u ' ) - m Enm - l ( U2r ) = nmQ3nr3 " ~ ' n ? + m n + m where Qm3 iS a polynomial in n , m of degree 3r - 3 . Now let 3r - 3 Enm ( U2r ) = nm ( n + m + 1 ) E ai1n my i , j = O i + j < 3r - 3 where ai5 = aji are to be determined . Substitution in ( 11 ) yields : ai [ ( n + m + 1 ) ntm ' - ( n - 1 ) ( n - 1 ) m - ( m - 1 ) n " ( m - 1 ) ' ] = Qnm3 i , j and rearrangement yields : a3nr - 3 i 3 - ( 12 ) 3 a3 a n1 ) ( _ a ( nim + nm = n - i + j ? 3r - 3 Consider first the terms of degree 3r - 3 . In this case i + j = 3r - 3 and a = i will give 3r - 3 E ai3r - 3 [ rntiM3r - 3 - i + ( i + l ) ( n 3r - 3 - i ? ni + n m3r - 3i ) ] i = O or 3r - 3 ( 13 ) 3r E ai3r - 3 - i n ' m i = O Equating the coefficients of these terms of degree 3r - 3 to the corresponding ones in Q3r - 3 it is possible to calculate the value of ai3r < 3i , ( i = 0 , . . . , 3r - 3 ) . We assume now that the aij are known for i + j > 3r - 3 - ( k - 1 ) and A TEST 57 we will find the value of aij where i + j = 3r - 3 - k . Consider then the terms in ( 12 ) of degree 3r - 3 - k . These terms will occur when i + j = 3r - 3 , a = i - k ; i + j = 3r - 4 , a = i - k + 1 ; . . . i + j = 3r - 3 - k , a = i All , but the last , contain coefficients which have already been evaluated .

This concludes the proof that Enm ( U2 ? ) is a polynomial in n , m of degree 3r and is divisible by nm ( n + m + 1 ) . We now investigate the coefficients of the terms of degree 3r .

B . MANN AND D . R . WHITNEY We now wish to show that Enm ( u2 ? ) is at most of degree 2r in n or m . For r = 1 , 2 this has already been established . Assuming that it is true for lower moments the right side of ( 10 ) , which reduces to nmQ " - s is at most of degree 2r - 1 in n . We again compare coefficients in ( 12 ) . First , for terms of degree 3r - 3 we have already seen that n has degree at most 2r - 2 . For terms of degree 3r - 4 we use i + j = 3r - 3 , a = i - 1 and i + j = 3r - 4 , a = i . The first case gives rise to no terms in n of degree greater than 2r - 2 so when we solve for the coefficients ai3r _ - i the coefficients of terms in n of degree greater than 2r - 2 must be zero . The process repeats and we find no terms in n or m of degree greater than 2r - 2 in the left side of ( 12 ) . This gives Enm ( U2r ) at most the degree 2r in n or m .

Another test which might seem appropriate for the comparison of a control group with a group receiving treatment is the test introduced by Wald and Wolfowitz [ 2 ] . The test by Wald and Wolfowitz is consistent with respect to every alternative g . However in the case considered we are only interested in the alternative hypothesis that measurements in the group receiving treatment are stochastically larger than in the control group . Intuitively , it seems that the test proposed here is more efficient for detecting the particular alternative considered than the test proposed by Wald and Wolfowitz . This intuitive feeling was borne out by the results of the test in the particular experiment described in the introduction . All in all , 62 experiments were conducted using various bacteria in different solutions and various amounts of the protective drug . The U Test gave 14 significant results on the 5 % level and 4 on the 1 % level . The test of Wald and Wolfowitz gave 7 significant results on the 5 % level and 2 on the 1 % level . A final decision between the two tests can , of course , only be arrived at on the basis of their power functions , which present formidable difficulties . In comparing the two statistics it was noted that a slight dislocation of a value may cause a significant change in the number of runs easier than it can cause a significant change in the ' statistic proposed here . For instance , in the sequence x1x2x3x4x6x6y1y2y3y4y5y6 both statistics would give a probability less than . 05 . If however , the sequence is slightly altered to X1X2X3X4XBY1X6Y2Y3Y4Y5Y6 , P ( number of runs < 4 ) > . 05 while P ( U < 1 ) = . 002 . After completion of the present paper it came to the authors attention that the U test had already been proposed by K . K . Mathen [ 3 ] . However Mathen ' s distribution of U is incorrect and its derivation erroneous , since it assumes independence of the random variables xij as defined in section 5 of the present paper , while obviously xij and xik are not independent .
