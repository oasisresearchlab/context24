A more connected hub or motif in the interaction network is expected to be more important , and any perturbation in this motif would be more damaging to the smooth performance of the related functions . Thus , some coherent robustness of these hubs has to be derived . Here , we provide the global evidence that interaction hubs obtain their robustness against uneven protein concentrations through co - expression of the con - stituents , and that the degree of co - expression correlates strongly with the complexity of the embedded motif . We calculated the gene expression correlations between the pro - teins embedded in 3 - , 4 - , 5 - , and 6 - node interaction motifs of increasing complexities , and compared them to those between proteins from random motifs of similar complexities . We ﬁnd that as the connectedness of these motifs increases , there is higher co - expression between the constituent proteins . For example , when the expression correlation is 0 . 7 , the kernel density of the correlation increases from 0 . 152 for 4 - node motifs with three edges to 0 . 403 for 4 - node cliques . This implies that the robustness of the interaction system emerges from a proportionate synchronicity among the constituents of the motif via co - expression . We further show that such biological coherence via co - expression of component proteins can be reinforced by integrating conservation data in the analysis . For example , with addition of evolutionary information from other genomes , the ratio of kernel density for interaction and random data in the case of 5 - and 6 - node cliques in yeast increases from 37 . 8 to 123 and 98 . 4 to 1300 , respectively , given that the expression correlation is 0 . 8 . Our results show that genes whose products are involved in motifs have transcription and translation properties that minimize the noise in ﬁnal protein concentrations , compared to random sets of genes .

Introduction A cellular function can rarely be attributed to a single gene , protein , metabo - lite or enzyme , but originates from well - coordinated and integrated activities of several such components . 1 – 3 For smooth carrying out of these functions , the inter - actions between diﬀerent proteins play prominent roles . 4 Recent breakthroughs in experimental high - throughput techniques have added signiﬁcantly to the number of protein – protein interactions . These techniques include yeast two - hybrid ( Y2H ) assays , 5 – 9 phage - display assays , 10 tandem aﬃnity puriﬁcations ( TAP ) , 11 , 12 co - immunoprecipitation , and aﬃnity chromatography . 8 , 13 , 14 A protein – protein interaction ( PPI ) network represents a highly complex and very vital topology that is best explained by an inherently uniform expo - nential architecture . 15 These networks display some interesting statistical char - acteristics , such as power law distribution ( P ( k ) ∼ k − γ ) , 1 , 16 the small world property , 1 , 17 , 18 anticorrelation in the node degree of connected nodes , 19 and hierar - chical modularity . 20 Analysis of multibody structures embedded in PPI also reveals two kinds of molecular modules : protein complexes and dynamic functional units . 21 Evolutionary analysis of these network demonstrates that interactive proteins evolve more slowly 22 although there have been some results to show otherwise . 23 , 24 Such properties of PPI networks have been used for various purposes such as identiﬁ - cation of functional clusters and novel protein – protein interactions , 25 deduction of local network structure , 26 and modeling of protein interactomes . 27 Characteriza - tion of these networks using three - dimensional ( 3D ) structures provides insight into their evolutionary rate and mechanisms of growth . 28 Building blocks of such networks are sub - networks which are generally referred to as motifs . 29 , 30 Network motifs are usually described as compact topologically distinct patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks . Their num - bers are signiﬁcantly higher than those in randomized networks . 29 Complexity of an interaction motif can be gauged by the number of interactions amongst its con - stituents . There is now accumulating evidence that the connectivity of proteins and complexity of the motifs they are embedded in correlate well with their functional essentiality . 16 , 31 – 35 Proteins embedded in more topologically complex motifs inter - act with a larger number of other proteins , and hence are expected to be involved in a greater number of functions . The most highly - connected proteins in a cell are the most important for its survival , and the likelihood that removal of a protein will prove lethal correlates with the number of interactions it has . 16 Therefore , a certain way of maintaining the robustness of these topological components is desired , as any perturbation in these hubs will be deleterious . Earlier , it has also been shown that conservation of motifs correlates well with the interconnectedness of the constituent proteins . 31 These studies provide ample evidence that there is selective pressure on the organism to conserve the highly - connected proteins . Protein – protein interaction data have been integrated with other types of data such as transcriptome , phenome , and gene expression data . 17 , 36 , 37 Integration of J . B i o i n f o r m .

January 29 , 2009 14 : 15 WSPC / 185 - JBCB 00395 Co - Expression Among Constituents of a Motif in the Protein – Protein Interaction Network 3 PPI with gene expression showed that protein pairs encoded by co - expressed genes interact with each other more frequently than random pairs . 38 Based on the co - expression levels among their constituents , Jansen et al . 39 classiﬁed yeast – protein complexes as either permanent or transient , with permanent ones being maintained through most cellular conditions . Previously , we have also shown that there is a strong relationship between PPI and gene expression of E . coli , and the relation - ship can be further strengthened , for some other species , by integration of evolution - ary information . 40 However , all these cross - correlating studies focused on two - body interactions . While the results of these studies give useful insights into how one set of data is reﬂected in another , studying multi - body interactions will augment our understanding of the underlying interactome – transcriptome relationship . Here , we extend the analysis to multi - body interaction to investigate the relationship between the structure of the motif the proteins are embedded in and the co - expression pat - terns of the parent genes . It should be noted that in this study we refer to motifs as distinct topological cohesive patterns of interactions . This deﬁnition of motifs relates more to their speciﬁc organization in the network rather than their frequen - cies , and has been used in other previous contexts and studies . 31 We chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Baker’s yeast ) as the model species for analysis because the interaction and expression data for this species are plentifully available . These data are conducive to statistically signiﬁcant conclusions . We ana - lyzed several distinct topological motifs of increasing complexity , both in terms of the number of nodes and the number of edges , and found that as the complexity of an interaction motif increases , there is a higher level of co - expression amongst its constituent proteins as compared to similar motifs with the same topology from a random network . Since the complexity of a motif reﬂects its essentiality , our ﬁndings show that for more important motifs , there is an increasing congeniality between their components as compared to random motifs . Taken together with the fact that co - expression patterns of genes indicate congruent protein concentrations , the results here suggest that there is a strong accord between the placement of the proteins in these networks and their amounts . This kind of association may be another way of deriving network robustness , in addition to the previously illustrated retention of such highly connected motifs through synergistic selection . 31 We have earlier shown that co - expression of genes encoding for two proteins that interact is conserved across species , and integration of evolutionary informa - tion strengthens the correlation between gene expression and protein interactions . 40 Similarly , extending the concept from pairwise interactions to multi - body interac - tions , we include evolutionary information across three other species : E . coli , mouse , and human . The correlation coeﬃcient for each edge of a motif in yeast is enriched by averaging it over the orthologous edge between the orthologous pairs in the other three species . We ﬁnd that such integration further augments the mean correlation for a motif . Interestingly , we also ﬁnd that the degree of this enrichment is cor - related with the complexity of the motif : a more complex motif witnesses a much higher increase in its mean correlation amongst its constituents .

Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Databases For a list of experimentally - detected protein – protein interactions in yeast , we used the information from the DIP database 28 ( http : / / dip . doe - mbi . ucla . edu ) ( as of Oct 2007 ) . This database contains 4 , 958 proteins with 17 , 525 interactions . Although yeast two - hybrid experiments , the source of the data , are criticized based on the accuracy of their results 6 , 28 , 41 ; the database currently stands as our best approximation . Furthermore , due to the large amount of information in the data , any statistically sound observation will be very likely to reveal the skeletal topology of the network . Orthologs datasets between the species were obtained from the InParanoid database of orthologs 42 ( http : / / inparanoid . cgb . ki . se ) . For this study , we chose only the core orthologous pair providing a bootstrap value of 100 % to eliminate one - to - many or many - to - many orthology . Gene expression data for all species were obtained from the publicly available Stanford microarray database 43 ( http : / / genome - www5 . stanford . edu ) . The expression set ranged over diﬀerent experiments in various biological conditions and was several microarrays in length . The data were normalized against the diﬀerent conditions used in these experiments by setting the mean of the proﬁle in each experiment to zero in the z - score fashion . 44 2 . 2 . Motif extraction Graphically , a motif is represented as an undirected sub - graph where each node represents a protein and an edge indicates an interaction between them . We used a progressive search procedure to identify 3 - , 4 - , 5 - , and 6 - node motifs of various complexities ( Table 1 ) . Progressive search procedure is a simple motif extraction procedure where more complex motifs are obtained from the less complex ones generated earlier . For example , 4 - node cliques are obtained by recursively searching for a protein that interacts with all the three proteins in a 3 - node clique [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . On the other hand , if this protein interacts with two of the three proteins , the resulting motifs is a 4 - node motif with one diagonal [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] . Similarly , beginning with a 3 - node motif with two edges , we look for a protein that interacts with all three nodes to obtain a 4 - node motif with one diagonal [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] . If this new protein interacts with only two proteins out of the three ( which do not have an edge between them ) , we obtain a 4 - node motif without any diagonal [ Fig . 1 ( d ) ] . Of course , at the end of the search , we may obtain multiple copies of the same motif , thus we remove the duplicates . 2 . 3 . Edge density Complexity of a motif was quantiﬁed in terms of the edge density deﬁned as 2 k / ( n × ( n − 1 ) ) , where k is the number of existing edges and n is the number of J .

This deﬁnition is similar to clustering coeﬃcient which is a measure of near - neighbors connectivity and , here , is applied to measure the connectivity of constituents of a motif as in previous studies . 45 This quantity ranges from 0 ( for no edges between the nodes ) to 1 ( for all possible edges existing ) . For example , com - plexity of a 4 - node motif with ﬁve edges would be 2 × 5 / ( 4 × ( 3 ) ) = 10 / 12 = 0 . 83 and that for a 5 - node motif with nine edges would be 2 × 9 / ( 5 × ( 4 ) ) = 18 / 20 = 0 . 9 . 2 . 4 . Generation of random motifs To examine the statistical signiﬁcance of the interaction motif data , we compared it to a control set . Since this study mainly relates to the complexity of the motifs , a property based on the topology of the network , we chose to generate a null model with the same topology and degree distribution as used previously . 17 This was done by shuﬄing the node labels while keeping the interaction edges constant . This method has been used in previous studies as well . Since the overall topology of the network is preserved , exactly the same number of random motifs was generated for all interaction motifs . 2 . 5 . Correlation with co - expression For each motif , we calculated the level of co - expression between all the pairs if there existed an edge between them . The Pearson correlation coeﬃcient ( PCC ) was employed as the measure of correlation between the expression proﬁles of the constituents . Mean correlation coeﬃcient for a motif was obtained by taking the average of PCC over all the edges , and it was used to represent the overall co - expression for this motif . Any consistent trend in the distribution of this coeﬃcient for motifs of diﬀerent complexities reﬂects a correlation between their topological compactness and expression proﬁling among their constituent proteins . We performed similar computations for random sets of motifs to judge the sta - tistical signiﬁcance of this correlation . For comparisons of the distributions of PCC for motifs in interaction and random networks , we used the kernel density function ( described in the supplementary materials a ) . Brieﬂy , for a random variable X , let x be the observed value of X , then Prob ( a < X < b ) = (cid:1) b a f X ( x ) dx , ( 1 ) where f X ( x ) is an associated density function . One of the types of f X is the Kernel density function which is of the form : ˆ f ( x ) = 1 n n (cid:2) i = 1 K (cid:3) x − x ( i ) h (cid:4) , ( 2 ) where K is the kernel function , h is the bandwidth , and n is the number of equally spaced points around which the density is to be estimated .

The contribution of data point x ( i ) to the estimate at some point x ∗ depends on how apart x ( i ) and x ∗ are . The extent of this contribution is dependent upon the shape of the kernel function adopted and the bandwidth h accorded to it . It is important to choose an appropri - ate value as small values of h lead to very spiky estimates ( under - smoothing ) while larger h values lead to oversmoothing . We chose Gaussian kernel function , which is of the form : K ( u ) = 1 √ 2 π exp (cid:3) − 1 2 u 2 (cid:4) . ( 3 ) Quantitatively , a higher value of kernel density at any abscissa reﬂects a higher probability of the variable falling around that abscissa . 2 . 6 . Integration of evolutionary information Orthologous interaction pairs in the other three species were generated from the list of orthologs for each interacting pair in yeast [ Fig . 1 ( e ) ] . PCC was calculated for each of these three orthologous pairs . Final correlation for the original pair in yeast was obtained by averaging the PCC over all the four pairs ( one for yeast and three for orthologous pairs ) . For those pairs in yeast that had no known orthologous pairs in one or more of the three species , average correlation was obtained by averaging only over the species that had orthologous pairs . 3 . Results The number of each type of motifs extracted from the interaction network in yeast is indicated in Table 1 along with its edge density . To correlate gene expression with protein interaction , we used the PCC calculated between the expression proﬁles of the genes whose protein products interact . Mean correlation for an interaction motif was obtained by averaging it over all the constituent proteins that interact . To appraise the statistical signiﬁcance of the correlation distribution for the interaction data , we compared it to the distribution for a random network with a similar topology . 3 . 1 . Correlation in yeast We ﬁnd that there is a well - deﬁned correlation between topological complexity of an interaction motif and co - expression amongst its constituent proteins ( Figs . 2 – 5 ) . This correlation is depicted in two parallel ways . First , as the complexity in terms of number of edges increases , the density distribution of correlation coeﬃcient for interaction motifs deviates more from randomness , implying a higher level of co - expression between the constituents of a motif with more complex architecture . For example , distribution for a 4 - node motif with all six edges [ Fig . 3 ( d ) ] is more J . B i o i n f o r m . C o m pu t . B i o l . 2009 . 07 : 1 - 17 .

See Fig . 2 for legend . dissimilar to that for a random network than the one for 4 - node motif with three or four edges [ Figs . 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) ] . Second , the extent of deviation from randomness is also higher with the number of nodes . As an example , the dissimilarity between the interaction and random data is more for a 6 - node clique than a 3 - or 4 - node clique . The above observation emphasizes a well - deﬁned coordination between proteins placed in a compact interaction motif , and suggests that a dense motif displays more co - expression amongst its components . We also report the P - value computed by the nonparametric Kolmogorov – Smirnov ( KS ) test ( right inset in Figs . 2 – 5 ) . P - value indicates the probability that the two distributions are coming from the same parent distribution , so a lower value would reﬂect a larger dissimilarity of the two datasets . From the trend of P - values for diﬀerent motifs with the same number of nodes , it can be seen that more compact motifs have lower P - values , indicating that the distribution of their correlation values is more departed from random distribution . For example , the P - value for motifs with four nodes decreases to 0 . 1342 , 0 . 0153 , 1 . 56 × 10 − 5 , and 2 . 87 × 10 − 5 as the number of edges between the participating proteins increases ( Fig . 3 ) .

Kernel density functions of expression correlation for interaction and random motifs with 6 nodes . See Fig . 2 for legend . A distinctive feature of the distribution of the correlation values is the dimin - ishing width of the random distribution as the complexities of the motifs increase . As shown in the supplementary Fig . 1 , the variance of the correlation values for random motifs decreases with the edge density of the motifs . This is a logical con - sequence of the fact that it is less probable for a random motif of higher complexity to show a larger correlation amongst its components . In order to obtain a high cor - relation value for a more complex motif , co - expression between all the constituents is required , which is less probable for a random motif . Another striking observation from the density function of the interaction motifs is the bimodal nature of the distribution in case of motifs with more than 5 - nodes . This observation has been reported previously in Han et al . , 17 where the average PCCs of “hubs” , deﬁned as proteins with degree k more than 5 , follow a bimodal distribution . Interestingly , we also found that the bimodal nature starts to appear for 5 - node motifs and is more pronounced in case of 6 - node motifs . Based on the bimodal nature , in that study , hubs were split into two populations based on a cutoﬀ : one with high average PCC and the other with relatively lower PCC . The former kinds of hubs were called “party” hubs that interact with their partner at the J . B i o i n f o r m . C o m pu t . B i o l . 2009 . 07 : 1 - 17 .

The latter kinds , on the other hand , called the “date” hubs , interact with their partners at diﬀerent time and / or space and so do not have as high correlation . In a parallel way , we investigated the spatial distribution of these motifs in various sub - cellular locations . We chose 6 - node cliques as our example set and based on their distribution , we set up a correlation cutoﬀ of 0 . 48 [ the dashed vertical line in Fig . 5 ( d ) ] . Analogous to previous deﬁnition , for a motif to be called a “party motif” , all its constituents have to be in the same sub - cellular location . If any two of its constituents are from two diﬀerent locations ( such as nucleus and cytoplasm ) , it would not be possible for the motif to exist at the same place / time and so it would be a “date motif” . Interestingly , with this criterion , we found that 86 % of the motifs having mean correlation above the aforementioned cutoﬀ qualiﬁed to be party motifs , i . e . they had all their constituents , from the same sub - cellular location . Moreover , 89 % of motifs with mean correlation below the cutoﬀ had at least one protein from a diﬀerent location from the rest of the constituents . This observation , while giving useful insight into the spatial dynamics of these motifs , demonstrates that the expression patterns of a protein are correlated with only its interaction partner , but also its placement in the network and its sub - cellular location . It has been shown earlier that in PPI network , hubs tend to be essential genes that are indispensable to the survival or reproduction of an organism . 16 To see how our results align with this previous observation , we focused on those proteins that are embedded in dense motifs , such as the cliques or motifs with higher number of proteins , as these proteins correspond to hubs in our framework . We examined all kinds of 6 - node motifs of increasing complexity for the number of constituent proteins that correspond to essential genes . The list of essential genes in yeast was obtained from a previous study 46 that annotated these genes based on experimental validation carried out by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Consortium . 47 We observed that as the edge density of the 6 - node motif increases , the number of proteins corresponding to essential genes increases ( Fig . 6 ) . This observation is parallel to the observation of Jeong et al . , 16 suggesting that essential proteins are involved in more interactions and are embedded in denser motifs . It has been shown with conclusive evidence that interacting proteins are more likely to be involved in similar function , and hence protein function can be eﬃ - ciently assigned using protein – protein interaction information . 48 , 49 We believe that by extending the prediction based on information from pairwise interaction to multi - body interactions ( between highly co - expressed proteins ) , will lend higher conﬁ - dence to the predicted function . For this purpose , we performed some case studies focusing on those 6 - node clique motifs which had co - expression coeﬃcient > 0 . 9 amongst their constituents and had at least one protein without any GO process term associated with it . With these ﬁlters , we found three such cases ( Table 2 ) . As evident from Table 2 , proteins embedded in these three motifs are all involved in a broad category of metabolic processes so we believe that there is a high prob - ability that the protein ( s ) with unknown GO process is also involved in some J .

Enrichment of the correlation by inclusion of multiple species Previously , we had demonstrated that co - expression of the genes whose protein products interact is preferentially conserved across genomes . 40 Thus , we integrated evolution information to strengthen the correlation between gene expression and protein – protein interactions . Here , we extend this idea to multi - body interactions among diﬀerent motifs . We enriched the correlation for an edge in a motif by merg - ing information from three other species : human , mouse , and E . coli . For each pair in yeast sharing an edge , orthologous pairs were generated in these three species J . B i o i n f o r m . C o m pu t . B i o l . 2009 . 07 : 1 - 17 .

Mean correlation for the original pair was obtained by averaging it over all the four species . Similar realizations were generated for random motifs from the null network . Kernel density distributions for interaction and random pairs were computed after the enrichment . We plotted the ratio of kernel density between interaction and random motifs after enrichment and compared it to a similar ratio before the integration of multiple species . We ﬁnd that addition of multiple species augments the co - expression coherence amongst the constituent proteins by several folds in an interaction motif . This is evident from the ratio of kernel density before and after the inclusion of multi - ple species for diﬀerent kinds of motifs ( Fig . 7 ) . For example , the ratio for 6 - node cliques increases from ∼ 8 , 073 to 15 , 311 when the expression correlation is 0 . 85 . Analogous to the observation for yeast , we perceive that the extent of improvement in the correlation due to co - expression is correlated with the complexity of a motif ; a more complex motif experiences a much higher improvement than a less complex ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Fig . 7 .

For example , when the expression correlation is 0 . 9 , the ratio for 6 - node cliques increases 1 . 9 - fold , as compared to 1 . 7 - fold increase for 6 - node motifs with one edge missing , or 1 . 8 - fold increase for 5 - node cliques with the same expression correla - tion . Overall , the above observations demonstrate that evolutionary information can be integrated purposefully to further boost multi - body correlations amongst the component proteins of an interaction motif . 4 . Discussion A protein interaction motif is a type of molecular machine that consists of pro - teins carrying out similar vital functions . When two proteins interact , they are more likely to be involved in the same function or pathway . For smooth running of the pathway or function , the participating proteins are required to be in the right amounts ; scarcity or overabundance of one relative to the other will be a hindrance . A balanced amount of each of them necessitates co - expression of the encoding genes . In spirit with this argument , we have shown that as the connectiv - ity and indispensability of a motif increases , there is higher coherence amongst the constituents through transcriptome co - expression . We have analyzed distinct topological motifs from the protein – protein interac - tion network of yeast , a species for which the data are plentifully available . We have calculated the gene - expression correlations between the genes encoding for proteins embedded in 3 - , 4 - , 5 - , and 6 - node motifs with increasing complexities , and then compared them to random motifs of similar complexities from a null model with the same topology and degree distribution . Our genome - wide analysis shows that the expression among the constituents of interaction motifs is much more correlated than that amongst random motifs , and this level of co - expression increases as the complexity of the motifs increases . This kind of cohesive pattern in the architecture of protein – protein interactions suggests that there is synchronicity among proteins embedded in a topologically complex motif derived through co - expression of the proteins . The underpinning idea of this study is consistent with earlier observations , which showed that more - connected proteins are more vital to the mechanics of the cell . 16 , 32 Thus , a higher selective pressure is required to retain these proteins , and this renders robustness against random mutations . The results above also prove that topological and contextual placement of a protein in the cellular network may impose a stoichiometric inﬂuence on the expression of the gene that encodes for it . We have also shown that this type of coherent patterns in interactome – transcriptome maps is further ampliﬁed by purposeful articulation of distant genotypes . This is expected in light of the recent demonstration that integra - tion of conservation information by inclusion of multiple species increases the cor - relation between gene expression proﬁles and pairwise interactions , indicating that co - expression of an interaction pair is more conserved than random pairs . 22 , 40 The presence of such underlying cohesive patterns in the interaction network topology is a meaningful implication of the fact that co - expression of genes whose protein products interact is evolutionarily coupled .

January 29 , 2009 14 : 15 WSPC / 185 - JBCB 00395 Co - Expression Among Constituents of a Motif in the Protein – Protein Interaction Network 15 Beyond unraveling the relation between an interaction motif’s importance and its underlying coherence through co - expression of the constituents , this cross - correlation study may also ﬁnd application in the prediction of protein – protein interactions . To begin with , if a protein observes a very high co - expression with all the other proteins in an interaction motif , it is more likely to interact with all or some of them . This kind of multi - body predictions will be more reﬁned and reli - able in comparison to prediction based on a simple pairwise correlation ( as studied with an example above ) . More broadly , such types of cross - reference studies will provide a platform for meaningful juxtaposition of various datasets and approaches to provide insights into underlying patterns in the immense amount of data being generated presently .
