Specifically , the study investi - gates the relationship between AI - DES , traditional lectures , and learning outcomes in the context of technopreneur - ship courses . A sample of 155 undergraduate students enrolled in technopreneurship courses at a university in Indonesia participated in the study . SmartPLS was used to analyze the data and explore the relationships among the variables . The findings reveal that AI - DES , while not directly influencing learning outcomes , significantly impacts traditional lectures . Consequently , traditional lectures play a mediating role in the relationship between AI - DES and learning outcomes . This novel finding highlights the in - terplay between simulation - based learning and traditional lectures in entrepreneurship education . Moreover , the study identifies the significance of refining the prompt used for the AI simulation to ensure its effectiveness in maintaining context and engaging students . The research contributes to the field of entrepreneurship education by providing empirical evidence of the positive impact of AI - DES and its indirect influence on learning outcomes through lectures . The study also identifies areas for improvement , such as generalizability limitations , sample size considerations , and the need for mixed - methods research designs .

I NTRODUCTION The role of entrepreneurship education in Indonesia is growing due to its potential to stimulate economic growth and create opportunities for employment . Indone - sia needs a minimum of four million new entrepreneurs to strengthen the economic foundation of the nation . According to an analysis recently conducted by the Ministry of Industry , the number of individuals engaged in entrepreneurial activities within the nation is at around 3 . 1 percent of the overall population [ 1 ] . Technopreneur - ship , a form of entrepreneurship that uses technology to develop innovative products or services , is experiencing an increase in popularity [ 2 ] . Technopreneurs integrate their technical knowledge with an entrepreneurial mind - set to establish successful enterprises , using technology to generate new prospects and disrupt conventional sec - tors . The significance of technopreneurship is expected to grow in the future due to the growing digitalization and technology - driven nature of the global landscape [ 3 ] . The technopreneurship programme at an Indonesian university emphasizes technology - based entrepreneur - ship . This course teaches fundraising and negotiating fundamentals . This goal has been difficult to achieve , especially in terms of student knowledge of investor relations . Based on experience , introducing genuine in - vestors to class is tough and challenging . The practice of pitching in a classroom setting may present several challenges for students . Ernst [ 4 ] ex - amines the educational tools employed in a student elevator pitch competition and evaluates how participants feel the outcome was met . This highlights the need to explore alternative approaches to pitching in class . One further obstacle that students may encounter during pitching exercises is to the integration of information and communication technology ( ICT ) inside educational settings . A study on the application of ICT in science classes identifies technical difficulties , student condi - tioning , student commitment , and online teaching expe - rience as potential obstacles faced by students during online classes [ 5 ] . These issues could hinder students’ capacity to effectively present their thoughts inside a virtual educational setting . Moreover , the performance of students might be influenced by their capacity to formulate and answer relevant questions during pitching exercises . A study on junior high school teachers’ math - ematical questioning ability found that when students are given a problem different from the exercise , they may become confused and struggle to know where to start and how to finish it [ 6 ] . This implies that learners can encounter difficulties in generating suitable inquiries throughout pitching exercises , so impeding their capacity 2023 8 t h I n t e r n a t i o n a l C o n f e r e n c e o n I n f o r m a t i o n T e c hn o l o g y a nd D i g i t a l A pp li c a t i o n s ( I C I T D A ) | 979 - 8 - 3503 - 4469 - 1 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 © 2023 I EE E | D O I : 10 . 1109 / I C I T D A 60835 . 2023 . 10427299 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . to efficiently express their ideas . In basic terms , students may struggle with classroom presentations . The conventional student elevator pitch may not achieve the instructional objective , requiring other methods . The use of ICT in education and the capacity to develop meaningful questions during pitching exercises may also challenge students . Teachers must evaluate these factors and provide coaching to help stu - dents handle these challenges and improve their pitching skills . This study proposes using AI - Driven Educational Simulations ( AI - DES ) to address these difficulties . AI - DES uses ChatGPT , an artificial intelligence language model , to replicate investor negotiations and give stu - dents real - time feedback during pitching simulations . Along with the simulation , the teacher speaks about fundraising and negotiations in order to assist students learn . This research addressed the implementation of AI - DES inside the framework of a technopreneurship course . The study sample included 128 undergraduate students who are currently involved in entrepreneurship education . At the start of the academic year , students were divided into groups with the aim of formulating a conceptual framework for a mobile application , esti - mating the required expenditures for its creation , and organizing teams , thus allowing them to interact with investors who might be interested . During the eighth week of the course , students were assigned the job with preparing a pitch for their mobile application concept and engaging in simulated investor dialogues , which were possible through the usage of ChatGPT . The aim of this research is to measure the efficacy of AI - DES as a pedagogical strategy in improving students’ proficiency in pitching , while simultaneously collecting their subjective assessments of the learning process . The primary aim of this study is to examine the rela - tionship between two different learning methodologies : the execution of pitching simulations using ChatGPT ( AI - DES ) and the delivery of theoretical lectures on fundraising and negotiations by the instructor ( Lecture ) . Through an analysis of this relationship , the study seeks to determine if the integration of pitching simulations alongside lectures enhances the accomplishment of the learning goal of applying key concepts in the domains of fundraising and negotiation among students . II . R ELATED S TUDY Lectures have long been used in academic settings to help students learn . Lectures teach students the basics by presenting knowledge , ideas , and concepts . Previous research has linked lecture use to learning objectives [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] . These studies have demonstrated the efficacy of lectures in promoting knowledge acquisition and skill development , thus highlighting the significance of lectures as a pedagogical approach . Case studies are a useful academic learning technique for achieving learning objectives . Students can apply theoretical information to real - life events by analyzing them in a case study . Previous study has studied how case studies help students achieve learning objectives [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] . These studies have demonstrated the efficacy of case studies in promoting critical thinking , problem - solving skills , and the application of theoretical concepts , thereby highlighting the significance of case studies as a pedagogical approach . The OpenAI Generative Pre - trained Transformer 3 ( ChatGPT ) is a state - of - the - art natural - language - processing ( NLP ) model . The model learns from its own mistakes in order to respond to natural - language ques - tions and remarks like a human would . [ 11 ] . ChatGPT’s ability to tailor lessons to each student’s specific needs is one of its most compelling features . Using the data collected from the students’ interactions with the model , ChatGPT is able to tailor its responses to better suit each student’s needs and preferred learning style [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . In education , Eke [ 14 ] argues that improper use of AI - powered text generators like ChatGPT might threaten academic integrity in education , despite its revolution - ary potential . Academic institutions , developers , policy - makers , publishers , professors , lecturers , and students must collaborate to accept ChatGPT , create training and capacity building programs , review academic integrity policies , recognize AI tools in academic texts , and detect dishonest use . Long - term academic honesty requires fundamental changes , according to the research . Peres , Schreier , Schweidel , and Sorescu [ 15 ] Peres et al . ( 2023 ) explore how higher education might respond to GenAI disruption . They believe students should learn to use GenAI technologies like ChatGPT to solve market - ing difficulties . Business school should prepare students for their careers by teaching them how to use the latest technology . GenAI tools must be used effectively by knowing how to write prompts , analyze GenAI output , and understand their limits . Large language models can be useful for university students in various ways , including assisting with re - search and writing tasks , developing critical thinking and problem - solving skills , generating summaries and outlines of texts , and providing information and re - sources on specific topics . They can also help students to analyze and understand material better , by highlighting unexplored aspects and current research topics [ 16 ] . III . M ETHODOLOGY The study involved a sample of 128 undergraduate students who were currently enrolled in a technopreneur - ship course at a university in Indonesia . These students were selected from five different classes in a rotating manner . Taking inspiration from the television series ”Dragon’s Den , ” ChatGPT took the character of a dragon investor , while the students were assigned the role of entrepreneurs . The simulation was split into separate Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . stages , beginning with the establishment of groups and progressing through successive phases of mobile app de - velopment planning throughout a span of seven sessions . The research approach utilized in this study is illustrated in Figure 1 . Fig . 1 . Methodology 1 . Preparation for The Simulation : The students form groups and create a plan for the development of mobile applications during a period of seven sessions . The process included many important phases , namely brain - storming , market research , and prototype . The program offered a structured framework for students to develop concepts for mobile applications . On the seventh meet - ing , student groups developed and presented their ideas . 2 . The Simulation using ChatGPT : After the end of pitch preparation , the participants received instructions to enter prompts into ChatGPT with the intention of requesting engagement from dragon investors . The user’s request includes using of ChatGPT to take on the role of a dragon persona from the television show ”Dragon’s Den” . ChatGPT offered questions and sought verification of the feasibility and potential of mobile app business concepts . Following the presentation , student groups participated in discussions with ChatGPT ( the dragon in - vestor ) through this round , focusing on investment terms , funding needs , and possible changes to their firm plan . During this stage , students were educated on the complex nature of investment negotiating dynamics . In the given situation , ChatGPT , in its role as the dragon investor , made decisions concerning accepting or rejecting the investment proposals presented by student groups . 3 . Distribute The Questionaiere : After the completion of the simulation , the students were given a set ques - tionnaire to assess their perspectives and opinions on the implementation of ChatGPT throughout the activity . This study aims to measure three factors , namely AI - DES , Lecture , and Learning Outcome . Within this context , the Lecture may be identified as the independent variable , while the Learning Outcome assumes the role of the dependent variable . The Likert scale was utilized in the development of the questionnaire . Presented below are the questions relating to each variable . AI - DES : To what extent did the AI - DES simulations enhance your understanding of investor interactions and pitching techniques ? To what extent did the AI - DES sim - ulations contribute to your confidence in engaging with potential investors and delivering compelling pitches ? Lecture : How effective did you find the lectures in providing theoretical knowledge on fundraising and ne - gotiation ? To what degree did the lectures contribute to your overall understanding of the principles of fundrais - ing and negotiation ? Learning Outcome : How well do you believe your comprehension of seeking funding has improved as a result of this course ? How likely are you to apply the knowledge gained in this course to pursue funding for your own projects or ventures ? 4 . Questionnaire Analysis using SmartPLS : The col - lected questionnaire data was analyzed using SmartPLS , a statistical software tool commonly used for structural equation modeling . In this analysis , the variables X1 represented ”AI - DES , ” X2 represented ”Lecture , ” and Y represented ”Funding and Negotiation , ” which served as the one of the desired learning outcome of the course . IV . R ESULT AND D ISCUSSION The choice of a prompt is of most importance in the context of replicating an investor’s reaction while using ChatGPT . The prompt serves as a guiding framework for ChatGPT’s responses , specifying the specific character - istics and categories of inquiries it will present to the student groups . Drawing inspiration from the popular television pro - gram ”Dragon’s Den , ” we initiated an interaction us - ing ChatGPT to imitate the response of an investor , replicating behaviors and questioning habits commonly observed among actual investors . The use of a context - specific prompt allowed ChatGPT to bring up relevant questions that are commonly faced during a pitching session , thus enhancing the authenticity of the simula - tion . In the initial group session , ChatGPT effectively assumed the role of an investor . ChatGPT was instructed to evaluate and either accept or decline the suggestions put forth by the students , while also minimizing the frequency of requesting further information . The evaluation of the correlation between AI - DES , Lecture , and Learning Outcome was carried out with SmartPLS , a widely used statistical technique in the field of structural equation modeling . The first results suggest that AI - DES did not have a statistically significant imme - diate effect on Learning Outcome . Nevertheless , in light of recognizing the complex structure of the relationship , modifications were made to the theoretical framework . Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . After doing more research , it was shown that AI - DES had an indirect impact on Learning Outcome through its affect on Lecture . The redesigned model demonstrated a good influence of AI - DES on Lecture , which then had a substantial effect on Learning Outcome . The surprising discovery indicates that the application of AI - DES during simulation exercises had an impact on the caliber and efficacy of the instructional sessions deliv - ered to the students , therefore enhancing their academic achievements .

TABLE II C ONSTRUCT R ESULT Cronbach’s Alpha AIDES 0 . 861 Learning Outcome ( Funding and Negotiation ) 0 . 794 Lecture 0 . 847 With relation to the adequacy of the model fit , the evaluation measures indicated a slightly satisfactory fit . The SRMR value of 0 . 071 , the d ULS value of 0 . 105 , and the d G value of 0 . 179 all met the criteria for acceptability . On top of that , the Chi - Square value of 149 . 644 and the Normed Fit Index ( NFI ) value of 0 . 721 provide additional evidence in favor of the overall suitability of the model .

The estimated adjusted R Square value , which takes into consideration the number of predictors and degrees of freedom , has been estimated to be 49 . 8 % . These results indicate that the model has an adequate amount of explanatory capacity for the dependent variable . The statistical analysis of the SmartPLS outputs re - vealed statistically significant results at a confidence level of 95 % , thus confirming the validity of the re - lationships within the model . Moreover , the lack of collinearity issues has been demonstrated by the results of the Variance Inflation Factor ( VIF ) as observed in table 1 . Fig . 2 . Model of AI - DES and Lecture on Learning Objective Based on figure 2 , the path coefficients gave insight into the degree and direction of the connections among the components . The study revealed a path coefficient of 0 . 823 between AI - DES and Lecture , suggesting a robust positive association . In a similar vein , the path coefficient between Lecture and Learning Outcomes was found to be 0 . 708 , indicating a statistically significant positive impact . V . C ONCLUSION The significant findings highlight the importance of AI - DES in influencing Lecture , which in turn impacts Learning Outcomes . These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between simulation - based learning , traditional lectures , and the learning outcomes in the context of entrepreneurship education . The identi - fication of this indirect influence of AI - DES on Learning Outcome through its impact on Lecture represents a novel finding in the field of entrepreneurship education . It underscores the intricate interplay between different educational strategies and highlights the potential of simulation - based learning in shaping the overall learning experience and outcomes of students . These findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge by shedding light on the relationship between AI - DES , Lecture , and Learning Outcome . They em - phasize the need for a comprehensive understanding of the factors that mediate the effectiveness of educational interventions . The incorporation of simulation exercises , such as AI - DES , can serve as a catalyst in enhancing traditional lecture - based instruction , leading to more favorable learning outcomes for students in the realm of entrepreneurship education .

The findings may not be directly applicable to other educational settings , warranting caution in extrapolat - ing the results . Additionally , the sample size of 128 undergraduate students could be considered relatively small , potentially affecting the statistical power and generalizability of the findings . Future research endeavors could encompass longitudi - nal studies to assess the long - term effects of AI - DES and Lecture on students’ learning outcomes , also research using a mix method to obtain more comprehensive re - sults . Comparative studies , contrasting the effectiveness of AI - DES with alternative teaching methods , would provide valuable insights into the relative advantages and disadvantages of different approaches . Moreover , employing mixed - methods research designs that incor - porate qualitative methodologies would offer a more comprehensive understanding of students’ experiences and perceptions .
