To reach their target destination , cells regularly follow guidance cues . However , these navigation signals may be obscured or not continuously present 1 , 2 , establishing the need for efficient search strategies 3 , 4 . Theoretical work has demonstrated that random walk with occasional large unidirectional translocations , such as Lévy flight and two - state ( that is intermittent ) motion , are statistically more efficient than Brownian motion 5 , 6 . In both cases , the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) increases superlinearly with time , which improves search efficiency by reducing oversampling 5 , 7 . Functionally , these strategies differ in their efficiency in detecting scarce targets , depending on whether they regenerate ( Lévy flights better ) or not ( two - state motion better ) 5 , 7 . Vertebrate cells rely on various propulsion systems to navigate their environments 8 – 10 , with actin - based protrusions represent - ing the most widely used form in adherent cells . Strikingly , such cells were described to employ Lévy flight and two - state motion in the absence of polarized external signals 3 , 11 . Yet , the underlying molecular mechanisms are only partially understood . To execute non - Brownian migration patterns , cells require signalling systems for spontaneous self - polarization as well as for persistent motion . At the molecular level , self - polarization has been described to occur through stochastic symmetry breaking followed by signal amplifi - cation 11 , 12 ( Supplementary Information ) . On polarization , motility is mediated by coupling cell - autonomous actomyosin - based forces to the extracellular matrix 10 , 13 , 14 . In its most common form , this is achieved through a branched actin network at the leading edge , the lamellipodium 15 – 19 , whereby motion persistence is determined by the longevity of these dynamic structures 20 , 21 . However , it is unclear how leading edge longevity is maintained , and in what form these transient protrusions contribute to the exploratory search pattern . Mechanochemical signalling at the leading edge Motility typically relies on actin - rich protrusions at the leading edge 10 , 15 – 19 , while some adherent cells may also take advantage of actin - free protrusions called blebs 9 . Here , we set out to investigate if and how actin - based leading edge dynamics mediate motion per - sistence . To do this , we tracked changes in motion dynamics and cell shape . Plated at low density and in the absence of polarized signal inputs ( for example gradients ) , the MSD of NIH 3T3 cells grew with time as t α with α ∼ 1 . 4 after 400 min , establishing superdiffusive non - Brownian motion ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . A detailed morphological characterization showed that phases of random motion were associated with transient cellular protrusions in various directions , sometimes even forming a multipolar phenotype , whereas persistently migrating cells displayed a comet shape with the leading edge ( that is lamellipodium ) continuously pointing in a particular direction ( Supplementary Fig . 1c and Supplementary Video 1 ) . We investigated what drives repeated leading edge protru - sions . As biochemical oscillators are often associated with specific frequencies 22 , we performed a power - spectral density analysis of these dynamic structures . Quantification of about 25 , 000 indi - vidual measurement points of the leading edge showed a wide fre - quency distribution rather than a single , distinct peak ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . Subsequent analysis of 1 , 126 individual extension – retraction cycles revealed that the width of frequency spectra is the cumulative consequence of variance in size and life - time of individual protrusions , low interdependence between cycles , and variability in relative speed within individual extension – retrac - tion cycles ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . Consistently , power - spectral density analysis of extension – retraction cycles in other migratory cell types also showed a wide frequency distribution ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1d ) , raising the question of what regulatory mechanisms beyond purely biochemical oscillators may contribute to continuous extension – retraction cycles of the leading edge . In search of morphological cues associated with leading edge dynamics , we investigated the ultrastructure using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . Actin - rich lamellipodia extend as flat sheets , bending upwards as they retract ( Fig . 1c ) . Intriguingly , we frequently observed highly curved plasma membrane ( PM ) structures at the base of lifted ( that is retracting ) lamellipodia Mechanochemical self - organization determines search pattern in migratory cells I .

However , navi - gational guidance cues are not always present , which establishes the need for exploratory search mechanisms in cells seeking signal inputs . Here , we investigate how non - Brownian search patterns emerge in adherent vertebrate cells . Combining experi - mental and theoretical analysis , we demonstrate that nanoscale plasma membrane deformations nucleate a mechanochemi - cal feedback loop that mediates longevity of the cell’s leading edge , a necessary requirement for directed cell migration . We further observe stochastic transitions between phases of random and persistent cell motion , whereby the mechanochemical circuit augments cell persistence and search area . Collectively , these findings are consistent with a self - organizing system for a superdiffusive pattern of motion that is spontaneously employed by migratory cells in the absence of external signal inputs .

To further determine the relevance of these structures , we performed lattice lightsheet microscopy ( LLM ) 23 . Strikingly , we found nascent lamellipodia emerging from such curved PM sites as the previous lamellipodium was retracting ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Fig . 1f and Supplementary Videos 2 and 3 ) , a phenomenon also observed in work from other laboratories 24 . Published models predict that curvature - dependent positive feedback loops may drive membrane deformation 25 – 27 . Consistently , we find actuators of actin polymerization enriched along the lamellipodial edge ( Supplementary Fig . 1g ) 28 – 31 . Strikingly , one of these actuators , BAIAP2 , not only drives actin polymerization but also contains a curvature - sensing I - BAR domain 29 – 34 .

NaTURe PhySICS | VOL 15 | AUGUST 2019 | 848 – 857 | www . nature . com / naturephysics 849 Articles NaTure PHysiCs reasoned that PM curvature may be critical for re - initiation and extension of nascent lamellipodia at the leading edge . To test the role of PM deformations in leading edge dynamics , we designed biosensors for outward ( negative ) curved membrane sections using the I - BAR domains of BAIAP2 , MTSS1L and MTSS1 . Curvature selectivity of individual biosensors was confirmed using PM tether pulling assays 35 , 36 ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) , correlative fluorescence - SEM 37 ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) and correl - ative immuno - SEM ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Notably , when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells , all biosensors were enriched along the lamellipodial edge , and the curvature - sensing domain of MTSS1L ( that is ABBA ) showed the strongest relative increase ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . We therefore continued our studies with this particular construct . Subsequent LLM established that the biosensor was enriched at highly curved PM sections and persisted at the lamellipodial edge throughout extension ( Fig . 2d , Supplementary Fig . 2e , f and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Consistently , quantification of recruit - ment dynamics using total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) micro scopy yielded substantial biosensor enrichment at the edge of extending lamellipodia ( Fig . 2d , right ) . Intriguingly , biosensor recruitment preceded not only lamellipodial extension but also actin accumulation ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Video 4 ) , indicating that curvature induction occurred before actin polymerization started . We thus aimed to determine the origin of PM deformation that triggered biosensor recruitment . Taking advantage of LLM and TIRF microscopy , we find the biosensor adjacent to paxillin at nascent lamellipodia ( Fig . 2e , Supplementary Fig . 2g and Supplementary Video 5 ) , arguing that focal adhesions ( FAs ) seed the highly curved nanoscale structures as the previous lamellipodium retracts . On the basis of these findings , we hypothesized that mechano - chemical self - organization may drive lamellipodial re - initiation at the leading edge ( Fig . 2f and Supplementary Fig . 2h ) . Following this hypothesis , highly deformed PM sites emerge near FAs as actomyosin - dependent contractile forces pull the previous lamel - lipodium backwards . These deformed PM sections then recruit curvature - sensing actin actuators ( for example I - BAR protein BAIAP2 ) , resulting in a local increase in polymerization dynamics that is required for lamellipodial re - initiation . Finally , as the nascent lamellipodium begins to extend , I - BAR proteins remain enriched at the highly curved rim of the growing structure , thus creating a curvature - dependent positive feedback loop that ensures efficient extension of the next lamellipodium at the leading edge . To probe this hypothesis , we developed in accordance with previ - ous theoretical work 25 – 27 a mathematical model of the proposed self - organizing system at the leading edge ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . The model was deliberately designed to be reductionist and minimal , to test whether a mechanochemical feedback loop is indeed sufficient to trigger lamellipodial re - initiation . Specifically , we assumed a 2D vertical plane through the lamellipodium , with horizontally stacked actin filaments . All actin filaments align with the growing end towards the membrane , and are subject to uniform actomyosin - based pull forces away from the PM . Countering the pull force , the lowest filament is anchored through an FA to the sub - strate . The interactions between individual filaments are considered , analogous to a Maxwell body , to be viscoelastic . Finally , local defor - mations of PM and membrane - associated actin structures yield a tension - dependent restoring force ( for details see Supplementary Information ) . Thus , forces acting on filament j at time t are given by ∑ = + + + F F F F F j t j t j t j t j t , , myosin , viscous , spring , membrane where F j t , myosin is the myosin pulling force , F j t , viscous and F j t , spring the viscous and elastic forces between neighbouring filaments , respec - tively , and F j t , membrane the membrane restoring force . For a discrete point t in time , the sum of all forces must be zero . By solving for the velocity of the j th filament ̇ X j t , abs , the filament tip position X j t , is updated . In addition , depending on local membrane deformation , curvature - dependent actin polymerization further changes tip posi - tions by ̇ X j t , pol . Finally , the new position of the filament tip is updated at time t + 1 such that = + ̇ + ̇ + X X X t X t d d j t j t j t j t , 1 , , abs , pol Starting from a uniformly bent PM , membrane curvature adjacent to FAs continuously increased due to elevated actin polymeriza - tion . On reaching a threshold , curvature - dependent propulsive forces formed a local positive feedback loop , whereby increase in actin polymerization was sufficient to maintain high membrane curvature , resulting in re - initiation and continuous elongation of the nascent lamellipodium ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Fig . 3b and Supplementary Video 6 ) . To probe the validity of the hypothesis and model , we then changed individual parameters in silico and compared model pre - dictions with experimental data ( Fig . 3a , right , and Supplementary Information ) . In a first set of experiments , actomyosin - based con - tractility was reduced . In silico , removal of pulling forces aborted curvature induction and thereby lamellipodium re - initiation ( Fig . 3b , left ) . In line with the model , we observed an acute drop in the number of continuous lamellipodial re - initiation events ( that is number ) on addition of ML - 7 , an inhibitor of myosin light - chain kinase ( Fig . 3b , right , and Supplementary Video 7 ) . Next , the func - tional consequences of changes in positive - feedback - loop strength were tested . In the model , the absence of curvature - dependent actuators ( that is I - BAR ) resulted in the formation of highly curved membrane sections without lamellipodium re - initiation ( Fig . 3c , left ) . Consistently , lowering levels of BAIAP2 , the most abundant I - BAR protein in fibroblasts ( Supplementary Fig . 3c – f ) , with short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) decreased lamellipodial re - initiation num - ber ( Fig . 3c , right ) . Finally , anchor strength was changed . In silico , a large reduction in FA strength caused slippage of the whole structure ( that is no changes in PM curvature ) , thus preclud - ing re - initiation ( Fig . 3d , left ) . Analogously , plating fibroblasts on ultrasoft substrate limited lamellipodial re - initiation ( Fig . 3d , right ) . Collectively , all model predictions are in line with experimental data and published results 18 , 38 – 40 . To further validate the self - organizing system , we next aimed to artificially trigger PM deformations to examine the consequences for lamellipodial dynamics ( Fig . 4a , left ) . In a first series of experi - ments , fibroblasts were plated on a fibronectin - coated Y - shaped micro pattern ( Fig . 4a , right ) . This forced cells to spread across an area more than twice as large as the cell median ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , and caused formation of highly curved PM sections along the z - axis at its distal ends ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Correlative fluorescence - SEM showed that this led to accumulation of endogenous BAIAP2 at such highly curved membrane sites ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Consistently , ratiometric analysis established biosensor enrichment at distal tips ( Fig . 4c ) . Having successfully induced PM curvature , we then probed for changes in lamellipodial dynamics . Strikingly , 56 out of 59 analysed cells showed lamellipodial struc - tures at all three distal ends that repeatedly extended and retracted ( Supplementary Fig . 4d – f and Supplementary Video 8 ) , suggesting that artificial curvature induction by a micropattern may activate the self - organizing system for lamellipodium re - initiation at the leading edge . Next , we set out to artificially trigger PM deformations in freely moving cells . Published work showed that curvature - sensitive pro - teins can act in a concentration - dependent manner as either cur - vature sensors or curvature inducers 32 , 41 . We thus hypothesized that massive overexpression of the I - BAR domain may elicit artificial NaTURe PhySICS | VOL 15 | AUGUST 2019 | 848 – 857 | www . nature . com / naturephysics 850 Articles NaTure PHysiCs PM deformation and trigger the self - organizing system ( Fig . 4d , top left ) . As full - length proteins contain additional domains , we took the sole I - BAR domain of MTSS1L and monitored its expression over time ( Fig . 4d , top right ) . Single - cell fluores - cence micro scopy revealed that expression for 18 – 22 h led to a 20 - fold increase in median signal intensity ( that is protein levels ) Time D i s t an c e Retraction Extension Re - initiation BSE 500 nm 120 0 3 Ratio 1 µ m Time ( s ) 0 60 Sensor / actin e TIRF kymograph SEM 500 nm 0 100 * * * 200 I n t e r i o r E dge C oun t s ( a . u . ) SEM / BSE 500 nm R a t i o s en s o r / pa x illi n R a t i o s en s o r / a c t i n * * * * 4 * * * 16 64 0 . 25 1 * * * 2 µ m 0 60 120 Time ( s ) Sensor / paxillin d 0 120 60 Time ( s ) c Kymograph Sensor / cyto 20 µ m 2 µ m 0 2 Ratio 0 2 Ratio f [ I - BAR ] ↑ [ Rac ] ↑ [ WAVE ] ↑ Actin Poly ↑ Curvature [ I - BAR ] ↑ [ Rac ] ↑ [ WAVE ] ↑ Actin Poly ↑ Curvature RetractingExtending Interior Nascent Time D i s t an c e Interior End of retraction 4 R a t i o s en s o r / cy t o s o l * * * 16 1 0 . 25 4 16 64 0 . 25 1 I n t e r i o r E dge LLM Sensor / actin 1 µ m 4 s 28 s 80 s 108 s 140 s x z TIRF kymograph LLM 2 µ m 0 s 32 s 56 s 68 s 100 s x z a I - BAR MTSS1L / cyto C e ll T e t he r R a t i o M T SS 1L / cy t o s o l 4 * * * 16 64 1 Opticaltrap b Bead Biosensor Cell Tether Fig . 2 | Curvature - dependent self - organization drives lamellipodial re - initiation at the leading edge . a , Curvature - dependent biosensor enrichment in membrane tether pulled using optical tweezers .

Intriguingly , analysis of cell morphology revealed that such massive I - BAR overexpression induced formation of mul - tipolar cells ( Fig . 4d , bottom , Fig . 4e and Supplementary Video 9 ) . This transition was further associated with an increase in actin - rich structures without altering cell size ( Supplementary Fig . 4g ) . Most striking , however , massive I - BAR overexpression increased the number of simultaneously present leading edges ( Fig . 4f and Supple mentary Fig . 4h ) , thus further strengthening the validity of the proposed model . Self - organization and cell persistence To probe the relevance of the self - organizing system for cell migra - tion , we took a closer look at motion patterns . We find a log - normal distribution for displacement per minute , while the angular distri - bution at first sight follows no apparent pattern ( Fig . 5a ) . As men - tioned above , cell traces frequently show phases of straight motion ( Supplementary Figs . 1a and 5a ) . Statistically , this manifested in an over - representation of subsequent steps with deflection smaller than 30° from the initial direction ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Using 30° as the threshold , we find extended phases of persistent and c 20 µ m 20 µ m 20 µ m 20 µ m b 20 µ m d Position ( a . u . ) 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 20 µ m – 14 T i m e ( m i n ) 14 7 0 – 7 ML - 7 addition 332 0 Pre ML - 7 Post ML - 7 Glass ~ 1 kPa shRNA Control shRNA BAIAP2 0 T i m e ( m i n ) Circumference ( µ m ) 30 0 30 0 0 T i m e ( m i n ) Circumference ( µ m ) 90 0 301 0 * * * s h R N A C on t r o l s h R N A BA I AP 2 75 70 90 0 549 0 a * * * C yc l e nu m be r 0 6 10 * * * P r e P o s t G l a ss ~ 1 k P a 2 4 8 0 15 20 5 10 0950 Frame Circumference ( µ m ) H e i gh t ( a . u . ) + 432 nm / 8 . 5 s – 432 nm / 8 . 5 s + 648 nm / 30 s – 648 nm / 30 s + 648 nm / 30 s – 648 nm / 30 s + 390 nm / 30 s – 390 nm / 30 s C yc l e nu m be r C yc l e nu m be r + 648 nm / 30 s – 648 nm / 30 s 1 . 5 2 . 0 F o l d c hange 10 – 2 Faster Slower 10 4 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 – 1 10 1 2 3 4 1 5 6 8 9 10 7 1 Substrate viscosity 2 Myosin 3 Filament viscosity 4 Filament elasticity 5 I - BAR curvature 6 I - BAR sensitivity 7 I - BAR diffusion 8 I - BAR concentration 9 PM tension 10 PM ellipticity ( x : y ) Model parameters Position ( a . u . ) 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 0950 Frame H e i gh t ( a . u . ) 1 . 5 2 . 0 Position ( a . u . ) 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 0950 Frame H e i gh t ( a . u . ) 1 . 5 2 . 0 Position ( a . u . ) 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 0950 Frame H e i gh t ( a . u . ) 1 . 5 2 . 0 0 15 20 5 10 Fig . 3 | Theoretical model and experimental validation of self - organizing system . a , Mathematical model of curvature - dependent self - organization at the leading edge ( see also Supplementary Information ) .

The fact that the self - organizing system is structurally embed - ded in the previous cycle is relevant for the motion pattern , as it may provide the mechanistic foundation for continuous lamel - lipodial re - initiation at the leading edge ( that is longevity ) and thereby motion persistence 20 , 21 . Indeed , published work has estab - lished that leading edge protrusions yield persistent cell motion when Rac / WAVE - mediated ARP2 / 3 activity dominates 20 . Notably , BAIAP2 , the most abundant I - BAR protein in fibroblasts , is an essential intermediate between WAVE and Rac 29 . Probing leading edge dynamics versus migration pattern , we find that phases of continued lamellipodial re - initiation are indeed associated with increased motion persistence ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . To better understand the relevance of persistent motion , we next developed a basic model for two - state motion . Analogous to experimental data ( Fig . 5b ) , the probability of staying in the persis - tent phase was given by ∝ τ − ∕ P m ( ) e t b b b and in the random phase by ∝ τ − ∕ P m ( ) e t d d d , where τ b and τ d are the average lifetimes of each phase , and t b and t d represent the continuous time spent since ini - tiation of the respective phase ( see Supplementary Information ) . Compared with random walk , two - state motion yields an increase in MSD and search area due to reduced oversampling of the same spot ( Fig . 5d ) . As two - state motion does not yield power - law regimes , τ b and τ d further determine the crossover point from the superdiffusive to the diffusive state ( Supplementary Fig . 5d , e and Supplementary Information ) . Next , to test the role of the self - organizing system for the motion pattern , we analysed cell traces in the absence of polarized signal inputs . Compared with the control , knockdown of BAIAP2 reduced MSD while the average inter - frame displacement ( d ) remained unchanged ( Fig . 5e , top , and Supplementary Fig . 5f ) . Directional analysis showed no difference in median angle distribution , but lifetime comparison suggested faster transitions between phases of directed and random motion ( Fig . 5e , bottom ) . Intriguingly , changes in transition frequency in the two - state model ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ′ ) resembled experimental data . In contrast , massive overexpression of the isolated I - BAR domain of MTSS1L reduced MSD without altering d , but median turning angles and random lifetimes ( that is continuous steps greater than 30° ) increased while persistence decreased ( Fig . 5f and Supplementary Fig . 5g ) . Again , the experimental data resembled the basic two - state model on changes in lifetime distribution ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . A detailed cellular analysis showed that massive I - BAR overexpres - sion resulted in shape changes caused by multiplication of extremely long - lived functional leading edges that were pulling simultaneously in opposite directions ( Supplementary Fig . 5h and Supplementary Video 10 ) .

Efficient search strategies are crucial for the immune system . We thus probed the self - organizing module in neutrophil - like PLB - 985 cells . Under steady - state conditions ( that is prior to inflammatory / chemotactic cues ) , neutrophils patrol the blood - stream 44 and tissue 45 in search of signals . Intriguingly , we find biosensor enrichment at the lamellipodial edge ( Fig . 6a ) . As in fibroblasts , phases of leading edge dynamics correlated with an increase in motion persistence ( Fig . 6b and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . Notably , MTSSL1 , the most abundant I - BAR protein in these cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , c ) , interacts and augments Rac activity 46 , raising the possibility that the self - organizing mod - ule may also yield lamellipodial and thus migration persistence in this cellular system 20 , 21 . Considering that migration in PLB - 985 cells relies on long - lived lamellipodia rather than on continued re - initiation 47 , we took a closer look at leading edge dynamics . We found a reduction in average lamellipodial velocity upon knockdown of MTSS1L , while massive I - BAR overexpression increased velocity ( Fig . 6c and Supplementary Fig . 6d ) . Changing feedback strength in the re - initi - ation model altered extension speed in a consistent fashion ( Fig . 6d ) . Knockdown of MTSS1L and massive I - BAR overexpression both reduced lamellipodial lifetime ( Fig . 6e ) . To test the functional con - sequences of the observed difference in lamellipodial dynamics , we monitored migration pattern . MTSS1L knockdown led to a signifi - cant reduction of MSD and d . We further observed an increase in median angle and extended random phases at the cost of persistent motion ( Fig . 6f , Supplementary Fig . 6e ) . Likewise , massive over - expression of the I - BAR domain reduced MSD and d , increased median angle and expanded random while shortening persistent lifetimes ( Fig . 6g and Supplementary Fig . 6f ) . Thus , in the absence of polarized signalling inputs , perturbation of the self - organizing module changed the lamellipodial lifetime and motion pattern to reduce MSD in a comparable fashion to fibroblasts and the basic two - state model . However , are these observed changes in migration physiologi - cally relevant ? Non - Brownian motion is a hallmark of self - pro - pelled particle models 48 , 49 . As shown in Supplementary Fig . 5d ′ , superdiffusivity is restricted to specific time and length scales . c d 10 0 10 3 T r a c e s 10 – 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Time ( a . u . ) 10 2 10 0 10 1 M S D ( p i x e l 2 ) α 100 ~ 1 . 4 α 100 ~ 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 1 . 5 α ( w ho l e t r a c e ) α ( protrusion ) 14 0 0 100 10 Lifetime ( min ) 7 F r equen cy 14 0 0 100 10 Lifetime ( min ) 7 F r equen cy a Low High Velocity Angle Low High 180 0 0 120 35 Angle ( ° ) 90 F r equen cy 3 . 9 0 0 250 125 Displacement ( µ m min −1 ) 1 . 3 F r equen cy 2 . 6 20 µ m e Control I - BAR [ high ] 20 µ m shRNA Control shRNA BAIAP2 4 0 Time ( h ) 4 0 Time ( h ) 180 0 A ng l e ( ° ) n . s . 90 180 0 A ng l e ( ° ) * * * 90 f Random Persistent b 84 % 0 Time ( min ) 300 150 F r equen cy 0 600 300 15 0 15 30 0 Angle < ± 30° Angle > ± 30° Angle X ( n + 1 ) │ Y ( n + 1 ) X ( n ) │ Y ( n ) X ( n + 2 ) │ Y ( n + 2 ) Time ( min ) M S D ( µ m 2 ) 10 – 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 – 2 10 2 10 0 10 1 Time ( min ) M S D ( µ m 2 ) 10 – 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 – 2 15 0 200 100 Time ( min ) 30 F r equen cy n . s . n . s . 0 Angle > ± 30° n . s . 3 0 . 1 d n . s . 3 0 . 1 d 1 15 0 0 300 600 Angle < ± 30° 10 2 10 0 10 1 Fig . 5 | Self - organizing system determines motion persistence and search area in NIh 3T3 fibroblasts . a , Analysis of NIH 3T3 migration .

NaTURe PhySICS | VOL 15 | AUGUST 2019 | 848 – 857 | www . nature . com / naturephysics 854 Articles NaTure PHysiCs To determine the relevance of these measurements , MSD needs therefore to be put in the perspective of cell size , which is in the case of neutrophils 154 ± 5 µ m 2 ( median ± s . e . m . , n = 18 cells ) . In neutro - phils , control cells covered in 100 min about 5 , 300 µ m 2 , while in the same time interval knockdown and overexpression yielded MSDs of about 300 µ m 2 and about 200 µ m 2 , respectively ( Fig . 6f , g ) . The same also applies to fibroblasts , where the MSD of perturbed cells after 300 min was about 2 . 5 ( knockdown ) to about 5 ( overexpres - sion ) times smaller than in control cells ( Fig . 5e , f ) . Considering that exploratory search patterns occur within appropriate dimensions ( that is larger than cell size ) , these calculations establish physiologi - cal relevance for the proposed mechanism . As regards how widespread the self - organizing module is , a pub - lished database indicates that components of the self - organizing module are commonly expressed in a variety of cell types 50 . Intriguingly , we find enrichment of the biosensor at the leading edge of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) and macrophage - like cells , as well as at the growth cone of primary mouse hippocampal neurons ( Supplementary Fig . 6g ) . In HUVEC cells , we further observed reduced MSD , increased median angle distribution and extended phases of random ( that is > 30° ) motion on massive I - BAR overexpression ( Supplementary Fig . 6h – k ) , sug - gesting the presence of the self - organizing module at least in some of these cell types . 10 µ m Sensor / cytosol C on t r o l I - B A R [ h i gh ] s i R N A C on t r o l s i R N A M T SS 1L * * * P r o t r u s i on li f e t i m e ( m i n ) a b e 0 . 51 4 I n t e r i o r E dge * * * 16 2 8 32 0 . 25 R a t i o s en s o r / cy t o s o l P r o t r u s i on li f e t i m e ( m i n ) * * * siRNA Control 10 µ m siRNA MTSS1L f Control I - BAR [ high ] g 10 µ m 30 0 Time ( min ) 30 0 Time ( min ) 180 0 A ng l e ( ° ) * * * 90 180 0 A ng l e ( ° ) * * * 90 0 . 5 8 2 32 16 4 1 0 . 5 8 2 32 16 4 1 P o s i t i on ( a . u . ) Time ( frames ) 950 750 2 [ I - BAR ] low 850 – 0 . 5 s i R N A C on t r o l s i R N A M T SS 1L 0 . 3 0 . 6 P r o t r u s i on v e l o c i t y ( µ m pe r 3 s ) C on t r o l I - B A R [ h i gh ] 0 . 4 * P r o t r u s i on v e l o c i t y ( µ m pe r 3 s ) * c d 0 . 5 0 . 3 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 5 1 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 1 . 5 α ( w ho l e t r a c e ) α ( protrusion ) 80 % 0 3 . 5 Ratio Position ( a . u . ) 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 – 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 0 950 Frame H e i gh t ( a . u . ) 1 . 5 2 . 0 [ I - BAR ] high [ I - BAR ] default 30 0 . 1 d 10 0 0 150 75 Time ( min ) 20 30 40 10 0 0 150 75 Time ( min ) 20 30 40 F r equen cy F r equen cy * * * 10 0 0 350 175 Angle < ± 30° Angle X ( n + 1 ) │ Y ( n + 1 ) X ( n ) │ Y ( n ) X ( n + 2 ) │ Y ( n + 2 ) Angle > ± 30° 10 0 0 350 175 Angle < ± 30° Angle > ± 30° 10 2 10 0 10 1 Time ( min ) M S D ( µ m 2 ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 – 1 10 2 10 0 10 1 Time ( min ) M S D ( µ m 2 ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 – 1 30 0 . 05 d * * * Fig . 6 | Self - organizing system determines motion persistence and search area in neutrophil - like PLB - 985 cells . a , Biosensor enriches at the leading edge .

NaTURe PhySICS | VOL 15 | AUGUST 2019 | 848 – 857 | www . nature . com / naturephysics 855 Articles NaTure PHysiCs Having established diminished search areas in the absence of polarized signalling inputs , we probed in a final set of experiments the functional relevance of the self - organizing module in the pres - ence of polarized signal inputs . Chemotaxis of NIH 3T3 cells was not affected by knockdown of BAIAP2 or massive overexpression of the I - BAR domain ( Supplementary Fig . 6l ) . Likewise , neither knockdown of MTSS1L nor overexpression affected chemotaxis in PLB - 985 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6m ) . Similar results were also observed in HUVEC cells , where overexpression changed neither chemotaxis ( Supplementary Fig . 6n ) nor migration directionality in a mosaic wound healing assay ( Supplementary Fig . 6o ) . Together , these results argue that the proposed self - organizing system augments exploratory search behaviour with - out affecting sensitivity to polarized signalling cues required for directed cell migration . Discussion Previous work established a non - Brownian search pattern in migra - tory cells 3 , 11 . Complementing these studies , we identify a self - orga - nizing module that mediates superdiffusive motion . The identified mechanism yields two major conclusions . First , it provides an answer to the important biological question of how vertebrate cells augment their search area in the absence of polarized external signals . Many adherent cells exhibit lamellipodial protrusions at the leading edge . Our work provides evidence for a self - organizing system that extends the lifetime of these dynamic protrusions , whereby lamellipodial longevity is mediated in a cell - specific manner by controlling either re - initiation frequency ( Fig . 3 ) or outgrowth duration ( Fig . 6 ) . Importantly , motion persis - tence relies on lamellipodial persistence 20 , 21 , which emerges when Rac / WAVE - mediated ARP2 / 3 activity drives actin polymerization at the leading edge 20 . Strikingly , the most abundant I - BAR domain protein in fibroblasts ( Supplementary Fig . 3c , d ) and neutrophils ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , c ) both interacts with and augments Rac / WAVE - mediated ARP2 / 3 signalling . Consistently , in both cell types phases of lamellipodial dynamics correlate with increased motion persistence ( Figs . 5c and 6b ) , and perturbations of the self - orga - nizing module changed lifetime distribution as well as search area ( Figs . 5e , f and 6f , g ) . Collectively , these results indicate that the self - organizing system at the leading edge yields motion persistence , a hallmark of exploratory two - state motion pattern . We consider the self - organizing mechanism described in this work to complement other regulatory mechanisms present at the leading edge . As such , it is a likely target for further modifications by external and intrinsic factors and cross - talk that collectively determine lamel - lipodial area , re - initiation probability and / or protrusion velocity of the leading edge and in consequence the migration pattern 11 , 51 ( Supplementary Information ) . Second , it advances our understanding of how cells manage to navigate a noisy environment . Cells detect and migrate along very shallow signalling gradients that are frequently obscured by high background 1 , 2 . The proposed mechanism allows cells to extend the lifetime of the leading edge , and thus migration in a particular direction , in the event of a transient loss in polarized signal input . Notably , lamellipodial re - initiation is preceded by a transient dissociation of curvature - sensitive actuators from the leading edge . Theoretical work on signal propagation has estab - lished that periodic extinguishing of activity permits a system to adapt more readily to changing external directional stimuli 52 , 53 . Thus , the mechanism described in this work may simultaneously maximize migration robustness and signal sensitivity in an ever - changing environment . Reporting Summary .

This form provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting . For further information on Nature Research policies , see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist . Statistical parameters When statistical analyses are reported , confirm that the following items are present in the relevant location ( e . g . figure legend , table legend , main text , or Methods section ) . n / a Confirmed The exact sample size ( n ) for each experimental group / condition , given as a discrete number and unit of measurement An indication of whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly The statistical test ( s ) used AND whether they are one - or two - sided Only common tests should be described solely by name ; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section . A description of all covariates tested A description of any assumptions or corrections , such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons A full description of the statistics including central tendency ( e . g . means ) or other basic estimates ( e . g . regression coefficient ) AND variation ( e . g . standard deviation ) or associated estimates of uncertainty ( e . g . confidence intervals ) For null hypothesis testing , the test statistic ( e . g . F , t , r ) with confidence intervals , effect sizes , degrees of freedom and P value noted Give P values as exact values whenever suitable . For Bayesian analysis , information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings For hierarchical and complex designs , identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes Estimates of effect sizes ( e . g . Cohen ' s d , Pearson ' s r ) , indicating how they were calculated Clearly defined error bars State explicitly what error bars represent ( e . g . SD , SE , CI ) Our web collection on statistics for biologists may be useful . Software and code Policy information about availability of computer code Data collection There was no data collected using a computer code . Data analysis All images were processed using Fiji / ImageJ version 1 . 49p or MatLab version 2015b and 2017b . For cell tracking , the integrated ImageJ plugins ‘TrackMate’ or ‘Manual Track’ were used . Ratiometric analysis , velocity maps , track analysis and vector analysis were done in MatLab using custom - made codes . Averaging and statistical analyses was performed using Excel and GraphPad Prism . Simulations were conducted in MatLab . Source code will be made publicly available on our homepage ( https : / / campus . uni - muenster . de / en / impb / das - institut / nanoscale - forces - in - cells / software / ) upon publication .
