Although brain - based creativity research has focused on static individual differences in trait creativity , less is known about changes in creative state within an individual . How does the brain augment state creativity when creative thinking is required ? Can augmented creative state be consciously engaged and disen - gaged dynamically across time ? Using a novel “thin slice” creativity paradigm in 55 fMRI participants performing verb - generation , we successfully cued large , conscious , short - duration increases in state creativity , indexed quantitatively by a measure of semantic distance derived via latent semantic analy - sis . A region of left frontopolar cortex , previously associated with creative integration of semantic information , exhibited increased activity and functional connectivity to anterior cingulate gyrus and right frontopolar cortex during cued augmentation of state creativity . Individual differences in the extent of increased activity in this region predicted individual differences in the extent to which partic - ipants were able to successfully augment state creative performance after accounting for trait creativity and intelligence .

But even the most creative people are not always being creative , and even generally uncreative people experience occasional moments of crea - tivity , so creativity is also a state [ Gilchrist and Taft , 1972 ; O’Hara and Sternberg , 2001 ] . Trait creativity has thus far been the primary focus of creativity research . For instance , Guilford’s inﬂuential theoretical framework [ Guilford , 1950 , 1967 ] , and the prominent Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking [ Goff and Torrance , 2002 ] are based on measurement of creativity as a stable trait quality , similar to IQ . Far less well understood , though no less important , is state creativity . Across several decades , the human capacity to consciously augment creativity has been demonstrated in multiple cognitive domains , Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article .

[ Chen et al . , 2005 ; Gilchrist and Taft , 1972 ; Green et al . , 2012a ; Harrington , 1975 ; Howard - Jones et al . , 2005 ; Niu and Sternberg , 2001 ; O’Hara and Sternberg , 2001 ; Seger et al . , 2000 ] . However , very little is known about the neu - ral mechanisms that support “thinking cap” augmenta - tion of creative state ( one exception may be work on the neural bases of musical improvisation [ Limb and Braun , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ] ) . This is particularly surprising because mechanisms that make creativity dynamic within an individual are likely to be critical for enabling current efforts in science [ Harrison et al . , 2012 ; NSF , 2011 ] , educa - tion [ NSF , 2013 ] , and industry [ IBM , 2010 ] to improve creative thinking and augment creative output [ Holyoak and Thagard , 1995 ; Sternberg and Lubart , 1991 ; Varta - nian , 2013 ] . At the cognitive level , an important remaining question is whether a person can engage and disengage augmented state creativity dynamically across time . To address this question , we have extensively validated a measure of “thin slice creativity” [ Prabhakaran et al . , 2013 ] , a variant of the classical verb - generation paradigm [ Petersen et al . , 1989 ] , devised to be compatible with neuroimaging and to elicit engagement of augmented state creativity over brief , dis - crete durations . Rigorous investigation of creativity requires tasks that are suitable for quantiﬁed psychomet - rics but also sufﬁciently open - ended to be construct - valid assays of creativity ( i . e . , they must allow freedom for divergent production ) . Accordingly , thin slice creativity task allows open - ended real time responding , and per - formance can be measured using a quantitative index of “semantic distance , ” derived via latent semantic analysis [ LSA ; Dumais , 2004 ; Landauer et al . , 1998 ] , a reliable and construct - valid measure of creativity [ Forster and Dunbar , 2009 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012b ; Prabhakaran et al . , 2013 ; Wolfe and Goldman , 2003 ] . Here , using the thin slice creativity task , an explicit crea - tivity cue successfully elicited repeated conscious engage - ment and disengagement of augmentated state creativity during fMRI , yielding a large effect on creative perform - ance and enabling direct investigation of neural activity associated with augmented creative state . We hypothe - sized that augmenting creativity would place greater demand on neural circuitry within frontopolar cortex that supports creative integration across semantic distance [ Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012b ; Ram - nani and Owen , 2004 ] . Thus , we speciﬁcally interrogated activity in frontopolar cortex as a predictor of state creativ - ity . Participants also performed a battery of trait creativity and intelligence measures outside the scanner , allowing us to examine neural mechanisms of state creativity in the context of trait creativity and intelligence . To test our cen - tral , a priori hypothesis , a series of analyses was con - ducted to evaluate whether increased frontopolar activity during the creativity cue predicted augmented creative performance , accounting for trait intelligence and creativ - ity variables , participant demographics , and activity in other brain regions . MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants Sixty - three healthy , right - handed native English speak - ers with no history of mental illness or psychoactive drug use , provided informed consent and participation in behavioral and fMRI sessions . All procedures received institutional review board ( IRB ) approval prior to the study . Data from eight participants were removed from analyses due to technical problems with the voice - recording microphone and / or presentation software that resulted in inaccurate or missing response timing data ( seven participants ) or errant execution of the scan acquisi - tion procedure ( one participant ) , such that 55 participants ( 31 male ; mean age 5 22 . 5 6 SD 5 4 . 78 years ) were included in our analyses . Power calculation indicated a required sample size of 54 to achieve 95 % power to detect an estimated effect size of 0 . 5 ( based on our prior behav - ioral data ; [ Prabhakaran et al . , 2013 ] ) for the effect of a cre - ativity cue on semantic distance via a two - tailed within - subjects t - test . Exceeding this minimum sample size by 15 % provided a buffer against technical problems associ - ated with our somewhat complex in - scanner voice - record - ing method , as well as ordinary issues with data usability in fMRI research . fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis Scanning was performed on a 3 - T Allegra System ( Sie - mens , Erlangen , Germany ) to collect whole - brain T2 * - weighted blood - oxygen - level dependent ( BOLD ) functional images ( asymmetric spin - echo echo - planar sequence ; whole - brain repetition time , TR 5 2 , 000 ms ; echo time 5 25 ms ; ﬁeld of view 5 256 mm ; ﬂip angle 5 80 (cid:2) ; matrix 5 64 3 64 ; axial slices 4 mm thick ) . Sequential whole - brain volumes ( 32 contiguous slices ) were collected during two event - related functional runs . 36 task trials were presented during each functional run . Each trial ended when a voice response was received , which trig - gered the PsyScope [ Cohen et al . , 1993 ] presentation script to continue . Voice responses were recorded using a noise - cancelling optical microphone system ( Phon - Or , Israel ) mounted to the head coil such that it could be situated 20 – 40 mm from participants’ lips . Responses were transcribed by an experimenter for subsequent LSA semantic distance calculation . “Jitter” was interleaved between trials , across a range from 250 to 4 , 250 ms in steps of 2 , 000 ms ( 1 TR ) . The scanning run began with an unanalyzed ﬁxation period equal to 3 TRs , which allowed the scanner to reach steady state . fMRI data processing was performed using fMRI expert analysis tool Version 5 . 98 , part of FMRIB’s Software Library , www . fmrib . ox . ac . uk / fsl . The following pre - statistics processing was applied : motion correction using MCFLIRT ; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 5 mm ; grand - mean intensity normalization of the r G reen et al . r r 2 r entire 4D dataset by a single multiplicative factor ; high - pass temporal ﬁltering ( Gaussian - weighted least - squares straight line ﬁtting , with sigma 5 50 . 0 s ) . Registration to high resolution structural and , subsequently , standard space images was performed using FLIRT . At the individ - ual subjects level , a design matrix was ﬁt to each subject’s data as part of a general linear model with each condition ( Cued and Uncued ) modeled as events with a speciﬁed duration ( i . e . , the time from stimulus onset to onset of the voice response ) convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function . Higher - level analysis was performed using FLAME . Z ( Gaussianised T / F ) statistic images were thresholded using a relatively conservative exploratory threshold of P < 0 . 0001 uncorrected . fMRI Task On each trial of the thin slice creativity verb - generation task , participants were presented with a noun on a com - puter screen and asked to say a verb that was related to the noun in any way . For example , given the noun prompt , “Yarn , ” participants generated spoken responses including “Sew” ( relatively uncreative ) and “Bleat” ( rela - tively creative ) . Of the 72 nouns presented across the two fMRI runs , half ( 36 ) were shown in green ( Cued condition ) and the other half in purple ( Uncued condition ) . For nouns presented in the cue color , participants were instructed to “think creatively when generating a verb response . ” Conditions were interleaved such that two tri - als of each condition were followed by two trials of the other condition . This design allowed us to investigate acute engagement of state creativity while minimizing set shifting and executive attention demands ( e . g . , from unpredictable or surprising shifts ) , which were not the intended targets of investigation . Validating the effective - ness of this design , we found that trials representing the shifts between Cued and Uncued conditions ( i . e . , the ﬁrst trial of a pair of Cued or Uncued trials ) did not differ from the trials that occurred after ( i . e . , the second trial of a pair ) with respect to semantic distance or response time ( RT ) ( all P for both Cued and Uncued trials > 0 . 3 ) . By design , the two word lists used for Cued and Uncued trials , respectively did not differ in terms of their average constraint t ( 70 ) 5 0 . 35 , P 5 0 . 73 , where constraint refers to the extent to which the noun is associated with a single common verb associate [ Barch et al . , 2000 ] . Con - straint level was based on normative pilot data from test - ing in an independent sample ( verb responses were obtained for each noun from 62 to 85 adults as part of a larger set of verb generation stimuli ; no creativity cue manipulation was used in this pilot testing ; see [ Prabha - karan et al . , 2013 ] ) . For example , the noun prompt , “Pie , ” was relatively high - constraint because more than 75 % of pilot participants generated the same verb response , “Eat , ” whereas the noun prompt , “Dirt , ” was relatively low con - straint because no single verb response accounted for as much as 25 % of responses . Cued and Uncued words also did not differ from each other on number of letters , t ( 70 ) 5 1 . 18 , P 5 . 244 . Item order and condition assignment of words were held constant across subjects to eliminate these factors as between - subjects variables because of our strong interest in individual differences in state creativity augmentation . Given our ability to control for word prop - erties , especially constraint , the introduction of a potential between - subjects confound was judged to represent an unnecessary cost . Supporting this design , we found that reversing condition assignment and cue color of the word list in two additional , modestly powered behaviorally tested university student groups ( Cue color green group : N 5 32 , 15 male , mean age 5 20 . 1 6 SD 5 2 . 65 years ; Cue color purple group : N 5 34 , 18 male , mean age 5 20 . 4 6 SD 5 3 . 02 years ) had no effect on Overall , Cued , Uncued , or D Semantic Distance ( all P (cid:3) 0 . 9 ) . For each noun , participants were given 8 seconds to indicate their verb response by speaking aloud , with voice responses recorded by the customized head coil - mounted microphone . We derived RT as the latency until the start of the spoken response ( the verb ) . Calculation of Semantic Distance via Latent Semantic Analysis Participants’ verb responses were transcribed from the digital voice recordings . A quantiﬁed measure of the semantic distance between each verb and its noun prompt was calculated via LSA [ Dumais , 2004 ; Landauer et al . , 1998 ] , a highly reliable measure with low measurement error and good construct validity [ Forster and Dunbar , 2009 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012b ; Landauer et al . , 1998 ; Prab - hakaran et al . , 2013 ; Wolfe and Goldman , 2003 ] . LSA is a method for quantifying the similarity between words based on statistical analyses of a large corpus of text ( see lsa . colorado . edu for additional details ) . We have previ - ously used LSA to obtain a quantiﬁable measure of crea - tivity in verb - generation and analogical reasoning , delineating a continuum of semantic distance between within - domain ( less creative ) and cross - domain ( more cre - ative ) analogical reasoning [ Green et al . , 2006 , 2008 , 2010 , 2012a , 2012b ; Prabhakaran et al . , 2013 ] . We used the topic space of “general reading up to ﬁrst year college ( 300 factors ) ” and term - to - term comparison type . Technically , this measure of semantic similarity cor - responds to the cosine of the angle between vectors corre - sponding ( in our usage ) to a noun and a verb within a given semantic space , which is derived through analyses of all of the contexts in which the word tends to be pres - ent or absent in that topic space [ Landauer et al . , 1998 ] . To provide a measure of semantic distance ( i . e . , the inverse of semantic similarity ) , LSA - derived semantic similarity values were subtracted from 1 ( i . e . , semantic distance 5 1—semantic similarity from LSA ) . Thus , the higher the semantic distance value between two words , the less r N euroimaging A ugmented S tate C reativity r r 3 r proximate their meanings in semantic space . Note that semantic distance is not a measure of the unusualness of the verb , but rather of the unusualness of the verb in the context of the given noun ; the noun is the same for all par - ticipants , but the verbs can vary . LSA values provide a highly reliable measure of noun – verb semantic distance , one with low measurement error and good construct validity [ Forster and Dunbar , 2009 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012b ; Landauer et al . , 1998 ; Prabhakaran et al . , 2013 ; Wolfe and Goldman , 2003 ] . Verb responses were excluded from the analysis if they were not in the LSA database ( 1 % of responses ) , or not recorded by the voice - recording system ( 0 . 7 % of responses ) . No more than ﬁve responses were excluded for any individual participant based on these exclusion criteria . Transcribed verb responses were not available from one participant . The validity of LSA as a measure of creativity has been demonstrated both conceptually and empirically . At the conceptual level , LSA provides an index of the difference between the context usage meanings of words . Thus , LSA - derived semantic distance measures semantic divergence [ Bossomaier et al . , 2009 ; Landauer et al . , 1998 ] , which is a core component of creativity [ Mayer , 1999 ] . Bossomaier et al . [ 2009 ] detail the conceptual and practical utility of corpus analysis tools such as LSA for the measurement of creativity , and empirical studies have demonstrated the validity of LSA as a creativity measure . Forster and Dun - bar [ 2009 ] successfully validated LSA - derived semantic distance as a method for scoring the classical uses of objects creativity measure , and argue that LSA actually provides a better model of underlying semantic originality than traditional human - rated methods . Our own prior work has also demonstrated that LSA - derived semantic distance closely matches creativity ratings assigned by human raters for creative analogy stimuli [ Green et al . , 2012b ] . Likewise , considerable research has demonstrated the reliability of the LSA measure for evaluating semantic dis - tance in complex human language usage . As reviewed by Wolfe and Goldman [ 2003 ] , there is substantial evidence to support the notion that the reliability of LSA is as good as human raters when asked to perform the same judgments . These authors consider studies that have used LSA for assessing a broad range of human - generated responses on complex cognitive tasks , including rating the quality of essays and summaries [ Foltz et al . , 2000 ; Kintsch et al . , 2000 ] , differentiating among texts on the basis of internal coherence [ Foltz et al . , 1998 ] , measuring a readers’ concep - tual understanding of a topic [ Wolfe et al . , 1998 ] , and rea - soning about conﬂicting accounts of historical events [ Wolfe and Goldman , 2003 ] . Trait Creativity and Intelligence Measures Outside of the scanner , participants performed behav - ioral tasks to measure trait creativity and intelligence . Trait creativity measures were Verbal and Figural items from the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking [ Goff and Torrance , 2002 ] , The Creative Achievement Questionnaire [ Carson et al . , 2005 ] , and a test of creative story - writing . Trait intel - ligence measures were abbreviated versions of the Wechs - ler Adult Intelligence Scale [ Wechsler , 2008 ] , including verbal and performance IQ measures , and Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices [ Raven , 1965 ] . Administra - tion and scoring of these tasks was as described in [ Prab - hakaran et al . , 2013 ] . Data were available for a minimum of 49 participants for each task . RESULTS Behavioral Participants generated verbs that were more semanti - cally distant from noun prompts when they were cued to think creatively ( i . e . , Cued trials ; LSA semantic distance value 5 0 . 74 6 SD 5 0 . 06 ) than when they were not ( i . e . , Uncued trials ; LSA semantic distance val - ue 5 0 . 67 6 SD 5 0 . 03 ) , t ( 53 ) 5 7 . 56 , P < 0 . 001 . Thus the effect of the cue represents an increase of more than two full standard deviations above Uncued performance ( Fig . 1 ) . Response times were also longer on Cued trials ( 4529 6 SD 5 1 , 021 ms ) than Uncued trials ( 3521 6 SD 5 649 ms ) , t ( 54 ) 5 9 . 42 , P < 0 . 001 . We have previously reported the results of trait creativity and intelligence measures administered to a large group of behaviorally tested partic - ipants [ Prabhakaran et al . , 2013 ] of which the current study’s fMRI sample was a subset . Here , we focus on the relationship of these behavioral measures to the brain imaging data collected in this subset . No sex differences were observed for age ( P 5 0 . 461 ) , I . Q . ( P 5 0 . 871 ) , or any measure of trait intelligence or creativity ( all P > 0 . 09 ) . Figure 1 . Behavioral performance on verb generation task by trial type ( Cued , Uncued ) measured by LSA - derived semantic distance . Participants generated verbs that were more semantically distant from noun prompts on Cued trials ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Error bars repre - sent one standard error of the mean . r G reen et al . r r 4 r Descriptive statistics and ﬁrst order correlations are pro - vided for all behavioral measures in Table I and Support - ing Information Table I . fMRI To determine the effect of the creativity cue on brain activity , independent of reaction time , we performed a whole - brain contrast of Cued > Uncued verb - generation , representing cue - related changes , including response time as a regressor of no interest in the design matrix . This con - trast revealed activity in frontopolar cortex as well as ante - rior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , angular gyrus , posterior cingulate gyrus , bilateral inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) , and left - lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( Fig . 2 ; Table II ) . The emergence of frontopolar activity after inclusion of response time as a regressor of no interest in the design matrix is consistent with previous evidence that speciﬁc task demands ( in this case state creativity augmentation ) , rather than time - on - task or difﬁculty per se , account for frontopolar recruitment [ Christoff et al . , 2001 ; Geake and Hansen , 2005 ] . The opposite contrast ( Uncued > Cued ) identiﬁed relatively few clusters of activity , with above - threshold peaks in bilateral precentral gyrus and putamen . We predicted that left medial frontopolar cortex would contribute to augmenting creative state . We have identiﬁed activity associated with creative analogical reasoning in this region in two prior studies , and found that this activ - ity increases as analogies become more creative [ Green et al . , 2010 , 2012b ] . Consistent with our prediction , the global maximum of activation for the Cued > Uncued con - trast ( Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) co - ordinates : x 5 2 4 , y 5 46 , z 5 28 ; survived whole - brain voxel - wise correction at P < 0 . 0001 ) was in a large cluster of activity in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex , including frontopolar cortex , which overlapped the functional peaks identiﬁed in our two prior studies of creative analogical reasoning . The frontopolar peak identiﬁed in the Cued > Uncued contrast remained signiﬁcant when this contrast was re - run with individual differences in absolute semantic dis - tance modeled as a covariate of no interest in the design matrix . Thus , although frontopolar activity was related to individual differences in semantic distance increases , as described below , performance effects ( measured by abso - lute semantic distance ) did not account for the Cue - related state effects observed in frontopolar cortex . This analysis was performed to further distinguish state effects from trait effects ; trait effects are more likely to be associated with individual differences in absolute semantic distance rather than individual differences in dynamic augmenta - tion of semantic distance . To further elucidate the within - subject changes associ - ated with augmented creative state , we conducted a within - subjects contrast of more versus less creative responses . Median splits were performed for each partici - pant’s responses in each run of the verb - generation task based on the LSA - derived semantic distances for their verb responses . First - level design matrices were set up for each run to contrast the above - median half of responses with the below - median half . Individual subjects data were then combined at the group level to generate the contrast TABLE I .

Scatter plot : Activity for the Cued > Uncued contrast extracted from the frontopolar ROI and plotted against D Semantic Distance for verb - generation responses in Cued versus Uncued trials . Cue - related increases in frontopolar cortex predicted increases in semantic distance of verb - generation . These data indicate that individuals who were more able to increase frontopolar activity on cue were more able to augment state creativity .

The results of this contrast ( exploratory whole - brain threshold P < 0 . 0001 uncorrected ) were similar to those of the Cued > Uncued contrast , which was also a within - subjects contrast . This is consistent with the ﬁnding that Cued responses were more creative than Uncued responses . The more creative versus less creative contrast yielded activity highly overlapping with the activity found in the Cued versus Uncued contrast , including in frontopolar cortex , anterior cingulate , bilateral IFG , posterior cingulate , para - hippocampal gyrus , bilateral occipital cuneus , and cerebel - lum . This analysis provides additional conﬁdence that within - subjects state creativity effects are associated with activity in the regions we have identiﬁed . Region of Interest Analysis To test the prediction that augmentation of frontopolar activity supports state augmentation of creative perform - ance , we deﬁned a region of interest ( ROI ) within left - sided frontopolar cortex as a 10 mm radius sphere , centered on the peak voxel of the frontopolar cluster iden - tiﬁed in the Cued > Uncued contrast . This frontopolar ROI was selected based on several converging justiﬁcations . At a theoretical level , we predicted that augmenting creativity would place greater demand on neural circuitry in fronto - polar cortex , which supports creative integration across semantic distance . This prediction was based on a recent meta - analysis of the creativity brain - imaging literature [ Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ] , as well as an inﬂuential model of frontopolar function , based on cytoarchitecture and neuroimaging , which indicates frontopolar cortex an integrator of information during abstract thinking [ Ramnani and Owen , 2004 ] . Semantic distance was the key measure of creativity in this study and the only two extant neuroimaging studies that have investigated semantic dis - tance have identiﬁed frontopolar cortex activity as a key indicator of individual differences [ Green et al . , 2010 , 2012b ] . Thus , our strongest a priori prediction for this study was that frontopolar cortex proximate to the func - tional peaks identiﬁed in these two studies ( which were quite proximate to each other ) would contribute to indi - vidual differences in state augmentation of creativity as measured by increased semantic distance . The cluster selected as the ROI overlapped both of the frontopolar functional peaks identiﬁed in these two prior investiga - tions of semantic distance . The selected ROI was centered on the global maximum of activation for the Cued > Uncued group contrast , the primary analysis of cued creative state augmentation . The activity observed in the present study is also overlapping with medial prefrontal activity identi - ﬁed during creative improvisation in rap artists and jazz musicians [ Limb and Braun , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ] , indicat - ing that when artists deliberately engage a creative state for novel generation of words and music , this frontopolar region is strongly engaged . It is important to note that cre - ativity is a broad and multifaceted construct . Although the present study draws hypotheses from the prior literature most relevant to our paradigm and research questions , it does not reﬂect all forms of creativity or all prior brain - based creativity ﬁndings . We regressed cue - related change in semantic distance for each participant ( referred to as D Semantic Distance ; the result of subtracting each participant’s average LSA - derived semantic distance values for Uncued trials from TABLE II .

Consistent with our prediction , D FPC was signiﬁcantly associated with D Semantic Distance ( r 5 0 . 40 , P 5 0 . 003 ; Fig . 2 ) . Recall that the individual differences investigated in this analysis are individual differences in amount of within - subject state augmentation of creativity between Cued and Uncued per - formance ( i . e . , D Semantic Distance is a within - subject dif - ference score ) . This difference thus reﬂects dynamic , transiently cued changes in level of creativity across time within an individual ( i . e . , state ) . To determine whether the ability to augment state crea - tivity was speciﬁcally due to greater capacity to augment recruitment of frontopolar cortex , rather than trait cogni - tive abilities , we repeated the regression , including our trait ability measures of creativity and intelligence as regressors . Consistent with our main prediction , D FPC was a signiﬁcant predictor of D Semantic Distance even after accounting for all trait creativity measures [ b 5 0 . 48 , t ( 45 ) 5 3 . 72 , P 5 0 . 001 ] and all trait intelligence measures [ b 5 0 . 42 , t ( 47 ) 5 3 . 03 , P 5 0 . 004 ] . An exploratory sequence of multiple regressions was conducted with each trait abil - ity measure individually , and all possible sets of trait abil - ity measures , regressed alongside D FPC . D FPC was signiﬁcantly predictive of D Semantic Distance in each of these models ( all P < 0 . 01 uncorrected ) . To test the anatomical speciﬁcity of the cue - related fron - topolar effect on D Semantic Distance , we extracted activ - ity for the Cued > Uncued contrast from an unthresholded Harvard – Oxford Cortical Atlas region containing all voxels in frontopolar cortex . This larger frontopolar ROI showed a nonsigniﬁcant , trend - level association with D Semantic Distance [ b 5 0 . 221 , t ( 53 ) 5 1 . 63 , P 5 0 . 109 ] . Including the activity in the larger frontopolar ROI in the regression with our 10 mm frontopolar ROI , the 10 mm ROI remained signiﬁcantly predictive of D Semantic Distance [ b 5 0 . 49 , t ( 53 ) 5 2 . 70 , P 5 0 . 009 ] , while the larger ROI was no longer signiﬁcantly predictive [ b 52 0 . 13 , t ( 53 ) 52 0 . 70 , P 5 0 . 489 ] . These ﬁndings indicate a high degree of ana - tomical speciﬁcity for state creativity - related activity in dorsal medial frontopolar cortex , consistent with evidence that this region of frontopolar cortex reliably demonstrates association with semantic distance processing [ Green et al . , 2010 , 2012b ] and extemporaneous musical improvi - sation [ Limb and Braun , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ] . Post hoc ROI analyses were performed to test whether changes in frontopolar activity were more strongly associ - ated with individual differences in augmented state crea - tivity than changes in other regions identiﬁed in the Cued > Uncued contrast . Activity for the Cued > Uncued contrast was extracted from 10 mm radius spheres cen - tered on each functional peak ( Table II ) . Signiﬁcant associ - ations with D Semantic Distance were found at a 5 0 . 05 uncorrected for anterior cingulate ( r 5 0 . 28 ) , cerebellar uvula ( r 5 0 . 29 ) , right parahippocampal gyrus ( r 5 0 . 30 ) , and left claustrum ( r 5 0 . 35 ) , indicating that these regions contributed to individual differences in state creativity augmentation . However , these associations were weaker than the association between D FPC and D Semantic Dis - tance , and D FPC remained signiﬁcantly predictive of D Semantic Distance even after regressors for these addi - tional regions were included alongside D FPC [ b 5 0 . 621 , t ( 53 ) 5 2 . 27 , P 5 0 . 028 ] . None of the additional regions remained signiﬁcantly predictive of D Semantic Distance in this model ( i . e . , after accounting for the effect of D FPC ) . To determine the extent to which the effect of the crea - tivity cue on frontopolar cortex was due to increasing frontopolar activity in the Cued condition and / or decreas - ing frontopolar activity in the Uncued condition , we regressed D FPC on frontopolar ROI activity extracted for Cued > Rest and Uncued > Rest contrasts . Activity for both contrasts showed signiﬁcant effects on D FPC ( both P < 0 . 001 ) , with Cued > Rest showing a positive association ( b 5 1 . 60 ) , and Uncued > Rest showing a negative associa - tion ( b 52 1 . 84 ) . Thus , it appears that D FPC is due to both lower activity for Uncued generation and higher activity for Cued generation . Given the relationship between D FPC and D Semantic Distance , this may indi - cate not only that greater ability to recruit frontopolar cor - tex on cue supports greater increases in state creativity , but also that individuals who have greater ability to aug - ment state creativity do not have to tax frontopolar cortex as heavily to generate Uncued verbs . To test this hypothe - sis , we regressed D Semantic Distance on frontopolar activ - ity for Cued > Rest and Uncued > Rest . This analysis revealed that both regressors were signiﬁcantly predictive of D Semantic Distance ( both P < 0 . 01 ) , with Cued > Rest again showing a positive association ( b 5 0 . 80 ) , and Uncued > Rest again showing a negative association ( b 5 2 0 . 71 ) . Analysis of Sex and IQ Range Including sex as a nominal covariate in our regression model along with the trait measure covariates did not sub - stantially alter the effect of D FPC on D Semantic Distance , b 5 0 . 48 , t ( 45 ) 5 3 . 42 , P 5 0 . 002 . Sex was not signiﬁcantly associated with D Semantic Distance in this model [ b 5 0 . 02 ; P 5 0 . 823 ] . Additionally , separate regression models for males [ b 5 0 . 60 , t ( 23 ) 5 2 . 81 , P 5 0 . 013 ] and females [ b 5 0 . 51 , t ( 21 ) 5 2 . 18 , P 5 0 . 047 ] revealed that both sexes showed an effect of D FPC on D Semantic Distance . We additionally performed a set of analyses to deter - mine the effect of high IQs and IQ range on our data . These analyses converge to demonstrate that the high IQs and somewhat truncated range of our full sample are unlikely to present signiﬁcant issues for the interpretability of our ﬁndings . First , we performed a median split of our sample by total IQ score . We then examined regression models for both the upper half and lower half of our IQ r N euroimaging A ugmented S tate C reativity r r 7 r range , including all trait creativity and intelligence covari - ates in the model . These analyses showed that the effect of primary interest ( i . e . , the effect of D FPC on D Semantic Distance ) was signiﬁcant in both the lower [ b 5 0 . 70 , t ( 23 ) 5 4 . 05 , P 5 0 . 001 ] and upper [ b 5 0 . 60 , t ( 21 ) 5 2 . 19 , P 5 0 . 047 ] halves of our IQ median split . These analyses show that the effect of D FPC on D Semantic Distance is at least as strong , and appears to be stronger , in the lower half of our IQ range , indicating our effect is not driven by extreme high IQs in our sample that are unrepresentative of the general population . Further , we performed an anal - ysis in which subjects in the two middle quartiles of our IQ range were excluded . This yielded a standard deviation of 13 . 9 ( 12 . 8 verbal , 15 . 3 performance ) , which is substan - tially greater than the standard deviation of 10 . 23 ( 9 . 9 verbal , 11 . 53 performance ) for the full sample . Running the full regression model with the middle IQ quartiles excluded again yielded a signiﬁcant effect of D FPC on D Semantic Distance [ b 5 0 . 49 , t ( 21 ) 5 2 . 51 P 5 0 . 026 ] . Functional Connectivity Analysis Functional connectivity analyses were performed using the frontopolar ROI as a seed region . To identify whether the creativity cue led to increased connectivity with fronto - polar cortex , we performed a psycho - physical interaction ( PPI ) analysis in FSL . A psychological “A 2 B” regressor represented the contrast of Cued > Uncued trials , a physio - logical regressor represented the extracted averaged time - course within the 10 mm - radius ROI , and a PPI regressor represented the interaction of the ﬁrst two regressors . In addition , a psychological “A 1 B” regressor was included to account for variance shared by Cued and Uncued trials . This analysis ( Fig . 3 ) revealed that the creativity cue led to increased connectivity between frontopolar cortex and ACC ( BA 24 ; Talairach co - ordinates of peak voxel : x 5 0 , y 5 32 , z 5 26 ; z - value for peak voxel 5 3 . 90 ) , as well as a region of right frontopolar cortex ( BA 10 ; Talairach co - ordinates of peak voxel : x 5 32 , y 5 50 , z 5 24 ; z - value for peak voxel 5 3 . 89 ) . By comparison , a basic functional con - nectivity analysis , using the extracted timecourse for the frontopolar ROI to predict activity across the whole brain on all trials ( not including the PPI regressor or the A 1 B regressor ) , revealed a more widely distributed network of regions , largely overlapping those identiﬁed in the Cued > Uncued contrast , including in bilateral inferior pre - frontal cortex . DISCUSSION This study investigated a valuable and commonly expe - rienced but poorly understood phenomenon : augmented state creativity . The ﬁndings indicate increased recruitment of frontopolar cortex as a mechanism for deliberate and acute augmentation of creative state , and demonstrate that augmented creative state can be dynamically engaged and disengaged across time . The large effect size elicited by our simple and direct creativity cue extends previous evi - dence that creativity cues can augment creative state [ Chen et al . , 2005 ; Gilchrist and Taft , 1972 ; Green et al . , 2012a ; Harrington , 1975 ; Howard - Jones et al . , 2005 ; Niu and Sternberg , 2001 ; O’Hara and Sternberg , 2001 ; Seger et al . , 2000 ; Shalley , 1991 ] . However , with a few exceptions [ Benedek et al . , 2013 ] , most neuroimaging studies of crea - tivity rely on relatively broad performance metrics , such as reaction time or the number of responses , rather than directly capturing creative production [ Fink et al . , 2007 ] . Prior brain - imaging studies of creative generation have reported frontopolar activity , among other activity [ Green et al . , 2012b ; Howard - Jones et al . , 2005 ; Seger et al . , 2000 ] . Green et al . [ 2012b ] found that activity in left frontopolar cortex parametrically varied with increasing semantic dis - tance during covert generation of analogical solutions . However , these studies did not obtain actual creative responses during neuroimaging [ Green et al . , 2012b ; Howard - Jones et al . , 2005 ; Seger et al . , 2000 ] , so it has not been possible to directly relate changes in activity to changes in a performance measure of creative production . In addition , the studies by Seger et al . [ 2000 ] and Howard - Jones et al . [ 2005 ] were limited by small fMRI samples of 7 and 8 participants , respectively . Other studies have inves - tigated passive evaluation of creative stimuli , and have also implicated left frontopolar cortex [ Green et al . , 2010 ; Rutter et al . , 2012 ] . The present study points to a fruitful avenue for the growing literature on frontopolar cortical function ( for reviews , see [ Gilbert et al . , 2006 ; Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , Figure 3 . Results of the whole - brain PPI functional connectivity analysis , thresholded at P < 0 . 0001 , showing regions that exhibit increased connectivity with the frontopolar seed region on Cued versus Uncued trials ( z 5 24 ) . A signiﬁcant cue - related increase in connectivity to the frontopolar ROI was found in anterior cingulate gyrus , as well as a region within right fronto - polar cortex . [ Color ﬁgure can be viewed in the online issue , which is available at wileyonlinelibrary . com . ] r G reen et al . r r 8 r 2013 ; Ramnani and Owen , 2004 ] ) . Previous studies have implicated frontopolar activity in creative responding [ Green et al . , 2012b ; Howard - Jones et al . , 2005 ; Seger et al . , 2000 ] , and in analogical mapping , a process that often requires integrating ostensibly dissimilar semantic repre - sentations [ Green et al . , 2008 , 2010 , 2012b ; Holyoak and Thagard , 1995 ] . We have previously found that frontopolar cortex is preferentially recruited for the relational integra - tion component of analogical reasoning as compared to other component processes that contribute to analogy [ Green et al . , 2006 ] , and that increasing frontopolar recruit - ment reﬂects increasing semantic distance in evaluating complete analogies [ Green et al . , 2010 ] and solving incom - plete analogies [ Green et al . , 2012b ] . Critically , the present ﬁndings demonstrate that frontopolar cortex activity can be increased as an active mechanism for the conscious effort to augment creative thinking , rather than simply reﬂecting receptive processing of stimuli that present vary - ing levels of semantic distance . This mechanism in fronto - polar cortex may be analogous to augmented activation in sensory cortices in the conscious effort to heighten atten - tion and improve processing of information in a speciﬁed modality [ Hopﬁnger et al . , 2000 ; Porro et al . , 2002 ; Ruff and Driver , 2006 ] . Interpretation of the present ﬁndings is informed by the cognitive - anatomical architecture of prefrontal function proposed by Ramnani and Owen [ 2004 ] . Within this archi - tecture , frontopolar cortex is specialized for integrating information , including pieces of information with dispar - ate cortical representations , which is a crucial operation for semantically distant verb - generation in response to prompt nouns . Increasing frontopolar cortical activity in the present investigation may reﬂect increasing computa - tional demand on neuronal circuitry in frontopolar cortex as semantic distance increases , as we have previously pos - ited [ Green et al . , 2010 , 2012b ] . Our data are also broadly consistent with previous empirical neurocognitive models placing anterior prefrontal cortex at the peak of a caudal - to - rostral progression or hierarchy in complex cognition [ Badre and Wagner , 2004 ; Christoff and Gabrieli , 2000 ] , and with evidence that , among patients with frontotempo - ral dementia , creative ability depends on the integrity of frontopolar cortex [ de Souza et al . , 2010 ] . The relatively medial locus of peak frontopolar activity in this present study may indicate preferential recruitment of medial frontopolar cortex during the conscious effort to think creatively . This may account for the involvement of medial frontopolar regions during extemporaneous musi - cal improvisation [ Limb and Braun , 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ] , and is consistent with prior evidence that medial frontopo - lar cortex is involved in making , and preparing to make , decisions among abstract alternatives ( in this case deciding among candidate verbs abstractly related to the noun prompts ) [ Hampton and O’Doherty , 2007 ; Haynes et al . , 2007 ; Soon et al . , 2013 ] . The seminal work of Beeman , Kou - nios and colleagues ( e . g . , [ Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ] ) has associated left - sided anterior medial prefrontal activity , proximate to the frontopolar activity we identiﬁed , with insight in creative problem solving . Our study did not ﬁnd the right - sided superior temporal activity observed by those authors , which may reﬂect the distinction between active , conscious augmentation of creative state and the somewhat less conscious mechanism by which insights arise , or other differences in task characteristics . A co - ordinate - based meta - analysis of the neuroimaging creativity literature , using activation likelihood estimation , identiﬁed medial frontopolar cortex , where frontopolar activity was observed in the present study , as a point of strong convergence among studies of unusualness genera - tion [ Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ] . Dividing creativity tasks into categories of unusualness generation and integration , the meta - analysis suggested that medial frontopolar cortex supports the formation of connections between semanti - cally distant representations in both unusualness genera - tion ( as in the present task ) , and integration ( e . g . , in creative analogical reasoning ) . In addition to frontopolar cortex , the creativity cue eli - cited responses in frontal regions including ACC and bilat - eral IFG . The ACC ﬁnding is consistent with a proposed role of ACC in conscious switching and maintenance of mental states , including resolution of conﬂict between competing states ( for review , see [ Tang et al . , 2012 ] ) . Ante - rior cingulate activity is also a consistent ﬁnding in verb - generation [ Barch et al . , 2000 ] , and generating novel uses of objects [ Abdullaev and Posner , 1997 ] , and is reliably related to the executive processes of response conﬂict and response selection ( i . e . , choosing which verb to say from among competing alternatives ) [ Barch et al . , 2000 ] . Increas - ing ACC activity on creativity cue trials may reﬂect the consideration of a greater number of possible responses , and is likely to reﬂect the inhibition of the ﬁrst response that comes to mind to select a more creative response [ Braver et al . , 2001 ] . Activity in bilateral IFG is also likely to reﬂect increasing selection demand as a component of the deliberate effort to augmented state creativity . IFG is reliably associated with tasks that require choosing among words or objects along some semantic dimension ( e . g . , color , size , expense , similarity ) [ Badre et al . , 2005 ] . Across studies , IFG has been preferentially recruited for higher versus lower selec - tion demand conditions , indicating that increasing activity in IFG supports a task - general selection process ( i . e . , iden - tifying the best alternative amid ambiguity or competition [ Badre et al . , 2005 ] and top - down inhibition of prepotent responding [ Aron et al . , 2014 ; Hampshire et al . , 2010 ] . The involvement of left IFG also likely reﬂects increased semantic elaboration [ Kapur et al . , 1994 ] as participants sought to elaborate from the prompt nouns and their pre - potent associations to ﬁnd nonobvious semantic associations . The ﬁnding of more posterior cortical involvement in the present study , especially posterior cingulate and cuneus , accords with the parietofrontal integration theory of intelligence [ P - FIT ; Jung and Haier , 2007 ] , an empirical r N euroimaging A ugmented S tate C reativity r r 9 r review - based account of the combined involvement of pos - terior and anterior regions in complex cognitive function . Notably , recent evidence indicates that the P - FIT model is applicable to creativity [ Jung et al . , 2010 ] . The ﬁnding of cerebellar involvement is generally con - sistent with recent models of cerebellum as a co - ordinator of mental operations that instantiate high - level cognition ( for review , see [ Ito , 2008 ] ) , and creativity in particular [ Chavez - Eakle et al . , 2007 ] . Parahippocampal recruitment has also been implicated in creative performance [ Chavez - Eakle et al . , 2007 ] and verb - generation [ Crescentini et al . , 2010 ] . Increased claustrum activity is associated with a heightened state of “in - the - zone” performance in athletes [ Ferrell et al . , 2006 ] , which may share properties with heightened creative state . Functional connectivity analyses revealed that , while frontopolar cortex participates in a broad network of func - tional connectivity during verb - generation , the creativity cue alters this network in a regionally speciﬁc way , espe - cially leading to greater connectivity with ACC . This ﬁnd - ing further underscores the importance of ACC function for deliberately augmenting creative state . In addition to a gen - eral role in conscious switching and maintenance of mental states [ Tang et al . , 2012 ] , ACC contributes to monitoring and resolving competition among semantic noun – verb con - nections [ Braver et al . , 2001 ] . The integrative function of frontopolar cortex is likely to support the formulation of these connections [ Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012b ; Ramnani and Owen , 2004 ] , requiring ongoing communication between frontopolar cortex and ACC . We hypothesize that the need for this communication increases under the Cued condition because bias toward prepotent verb associates is inhibited , leading to an expanded set of possible connections to be monitored [ Braver et al . , 2001 ] . The observed cue - related increase in functional connec - tivity with right frontopolar cortex is also likely to support inhibition of prepotent , uncreative responses based on similar involvement of this region in previous creativity research [ Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ] . The fact that fronto - polar cortex increases activity during the creativity cue , but shows limited , focal increases in connectivity , suggests that augmenting creativity depends more on augmenting integrative function within frontopolar cortex than on increasing the already - high levels of communication between frontopolar cortex and other task - relevant regions ( e . g . , language areas in IFG ) .
