ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY 138 , 141 - 143 ( 1984 ) A Method for the Quantitative Recovery of Protein in Dilute Solution in the Presence of Detergents and Lipids D . WESSEL AND U . I . FL ~ GGE Lehrstuhl fir Biochemie der PJanze , Untere Karsptile 2 , 3400 Giittingen , Federal Republic of Germany Received August 22 , 1983 A rapid method based on a defined methanol - chloroform - water mixture for the quantitative precipitation of soluble as well as hydrophobic proteins from dilute solutions ( e . g . , column chromatography effluents ) has been developed . The effectiveness of this method is not affected by the presence of detergents , lipids , salt , buffers , and @ - mercaptoethanol . KEY WORDS : protein precipitation ; TX - 100 ; lipids ; @ mercaptoethanol ; sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . The quantitative ( e . g . , by Lowry’s assay ) or the qualitative ( e . g . , by SDS - PAGE ) ’ deter - mination of dilute samples of protein con - taining salt , detergents like TX - 100 , phos - pholipids , or P - mercaptoethanol is difficult because of the interference of these substances with the analysis methods . Several procedures which circumvent these problems by initial removal of the detergent ( l - 3 ) or / 3 - mercap - toethanol ( 4 ) prior to the analysis step have been published . However , these methods are suitable only if the sample contains enough protein to be analyzed without further con - centration . Dilute protein samples , however , have to be concentrated . Concentration to - gether with the removal of interfering sub - stances could be attempted by acid precipi - tation ( 5 - 7 ) and / or precipitation by acetone or methanol ( 8 ) . However , it is often difficult to find optimal precipitation conditions espe - cially when working with hydrophobic ( mem - brane ) proteins in the presence of detergents and / or phospholipids . In this paper we report a method for the quantitative precipitation of soluble as well as i Abbreviations used SDS - PAGE , sodium dodecyl sul - fate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ; BSA , bovine serum albumin ; TX - 100 , Triton X - 100 ; & ME , & mer - captoethanol . hydrophobic membrane proteins which is not sensitive to interference by the presence of salt , detergents , / 3 - mercaptoethanol , or phos - pholipids . Samples ready for protein assay or SDS - gel electrophoresis can be prepared in less than 20 min . MATERIALS AND METHODS Bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , sodium do - decyl sulfate ( SDS ) , TX - 100 , and asolectin were purchased from Sigma ; methanol and chloroform from Merck , Darmstadt , FRG ; and rabbit serum from Calbiochem . Mem - brane proteins from spinach envelopes were prepared according to Deuce et al . ( 9 ) . Protein was analyzed by the method of Lowry ( 10 ) and SDS - gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli ( 1 l ) , using 12 . 5 % acrylamide and 0 . 1 % NJ’ - methylenebisac - rylamide . Procedure . An aliquot ( 0 . 4 ml ) of methanol is added to 0 . 1 ml of protein sample and the samples are vortexed and centrifuged ( 10 s at 90008 ) for total collection of the sample . Then chloroform ( 0 . 1 ml ) is added and the samples are vortexed and centrifuged again ( 10 s at 9000g ) . For samples containing a high con - centration of phospholipids ( e . g . , liposomes ) 0 . 2 ml of chloroform is used . For phase sep - aration 0 . 3 ml of water is added , and the sam - 141 0003 - 2697184 $ 3 . 00 Copyright Q 1984 by Academic Press , Inc .

A further 0 . 3 ml methanol is added to the rest of the lower chloroform phase and the interphase with the precipitated protein . The samples are mixed and centrifuged again for 2 min at 9000g to pellet the protein . The supematant is removed and the protein pellet is dried under a stream of air . The dried pellet can be stored now until use . For protein determination the pellets are solubilized by the addition of 50 - 100 ~ 1 of SDS ( 5 % ) and assayed according to the Lowry procedure ( 10 ) . For SDS - gel electrophoresis the pellets are dissolved in 50 ~ 1 electrophoresis sample buffer ( 11 ) containing 5 % SDS . The above procedure can be reliably adapted to a larger sample volume . Large samples ( 1 ml ) are precipitated with 4 ml methanol , 1 ml chloroform , and 3 ml water . After centrifugation and removal of the upper phase the lower phase and the interphase are transferred to 1 . 5 - ml tubes and the subsequent procedures are as described above . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The above procedure for the quantitative protein precipitation from solutions contain - ing salt , / 3 - mercaptoethanol , or detergents starts with the addition of 4 parts methanol and 1 part chloroform to 1 part of sample . A phase separation is achieved by the addition of 3 parts water whereby the protein is pre - cipitated at the chloroform - methanol - water interphase . The addition of an excess of meth - anol and the subsequent centrifugation results in a protein pellet which is totally free of in - terfering substances . Table 1 shows the effi - ciency of this method for the precipitation of soluble proteins , e . g . , for BSA or for the serum proteins from rabbit , as well as for hydro - phobic membrane proteins ( e . g . , the proteins of the chloroplast envelope membrane or membrane proteins from rat liver ) . The pres - ence of the anionic detergent SDS ( up to 5 % ) does not appear to affect the recovery of pro - tein obtained by this method . The same result is obtained in the presence of the nonionic TABLE 1 RECOVERY OF PROTEIN PRECIPITATED IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER SUBSTANCES Amount of protein recovered Soluble proteins Membrane proteins from Serum proteins Chloroplast Mitochondria BSA ( rabbit ) envelopes ( rat liver ) Control , not precipitated ( pg ) 40 120 50 . 0 60 . 9” 76 . 0“ Protein precipitated ( yield , % ) in samples containing - 96 f 1 . 2 97 + 2 . 3 100 _ + 1 . 8 - - 5 % SDS 92 + 2 . 5 92 f 1 . 8 94 + 1 . 5 94 + 0 . 8 94 iT 1 . 5 1 % TX - 100 100 + 2 . 3 92 + 4 . 6 95 - t 2 . 3 100b + 0 . 6 95b + 2 . 3 2 % TX - 100 98 + 1 . 8 96 - t 3 . 5 95 f 2 . 1 100b f 0 . 6 95b + 2 . 1 1 % TX - 100 plus 20 mg / ml asolectin n . d . n . d . 94 + 1 . 9 94b + 0 . 6 94b + 1 . 9 1 % TX - 100 plus 0 . 5 M KCl 95 + 2 . 1 100 + 3 . 8 n . d . 95b + 2 . 5 n . d . 1 % TX - 100 plus I % / Y - ME 95 + 4 . 0 98 rt 2 . 2 96 k 2 . 2 98b + 2 . 2 96b f 2 . 5 Note .

PROTEIN RECOVERY IN DILUTE SOLUTION 143 ited only by the sensitivity of the protein de - termination method applied subsequently . So far , little is known about the molecular weight cutoffs for this procedure , but even with car - bonic anhydrase ( M , 30 , 000 ) , trypsinogen ( M , 24 , 000 ) and & lactoglobulin ( M , 18 , 400 ) the protein recovery is comparable to that outlined in Table 1 ( results not shown ) . The method is also effective for the removal of lipids from membranes with a high lipid / protein ratio . Due to the high lipid content , a distortion of the SDS - gel pattern of those membranes , for example , the outer envelope membrane of spinach chloroplasts with a lipid / protein ratio of 3 ( 13 ) is observed ( Fig . 1 , lane 2 ) . Removal of the lipids by the above method leads to an improved protein pattern without any ap - parent quantitative loss of protein ( Fig . 1 , lane 3 ) .
