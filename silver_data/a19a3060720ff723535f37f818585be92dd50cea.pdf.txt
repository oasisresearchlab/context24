However , it is not clear how these factors interrelate and whether effects on men and women differ . We conducted an observational , cross - sectional study using a national COVID - 19 inpatient database . We studied differences in direct and indirect effects of obesity and comorbidities according to sex and body mass index ( BMI ) categories in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients in Brazil using path analysis models and logistic regression . For men , path analysis showed a direct association between BMI and death and a negative correlation of death and chronic cardiovascular disease ( CCD ) . For women , the association of BMI and death was indirect , mediated by admission to the ICU and comorbidities and association with CCD was non - significant . In the logistic regression analyses , there was a positive association between death and BMI , age , diabetes mellitus , kidney and lung diseases and ICU admission . We highlight the need to consider the distinct impact of obesity and sex on COVID - 19 , of monitoring of BMI and of the design for specific male - targeted approaches to manage obesity .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1655 Introduction By June 2021 , 6 , 493 , 773 COVID - 19 deaths and 603 , 927 , 234 infected people had been reported world - wide [ 1 ] . By then , Brazil had 34 , 456 , 145 confirmed cases and 684 , 262 deaths , with 2 . 0 % mortality rate [ 2 ] turning the country into one of the worst hit by the pandemic . The severity of COVID - 19 symptoms varies widely , ranging from mild or even asymptomatic to very severe , leading to death [ 3 ] . Among the main risk factors asso - ciated with the poor prognosis of COVID - 19 , advanced age , male sex and the presence of comorbidities stand out , with emphasis on cardiovascular diseases , lung diseases , diabetes , kidney disease , chronic liver dis - ease and obesity [ 4 , 5 ] . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) above 30 kg / m 2 is associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients infected with the new coronavirus [ 5 – 7 ] . In Brazil , 34 . 4 % of the adult population is overweight and 25 . 9 % has obesity [ 8 ] . Obesity is related to changes in breathing dynamics favoring complications in COVID - 19 , such as increased demand for ventilation and breath - ing effort . These changes increases chances of more severe breathing infections [ 6 , 9 ] . Obesity was also found to be a strong independent factor for respiratory failure , UCI admission and death among COVID - 19 patients [ 10 ] . The physiopathology of obesity involves an inflam - matory state associated with chronic activation of the immune system , which negatively affects immune func - tions . This engenders a large release of cytokines and chemokines and the recruitment of cells that produce pro - inflammatory molecules , with increased immune responses and high rates of multisystemic complica - tions [ 11 ] . The expression of the angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE2 ) gene also seems to be increased in the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue , favoring the entry of the COVID - 19 virus into the host cell and wors - ening the infection in patients with obesity [ 12 ] . Besides acting as an independent factor for unfavor - able outcomes in COVID - 19 infection , obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases , diabetes , high blood pressure and different kinds of cancer , which are in them - selves risk factors for worse outcomes in this disease [ 13 ] . This raises initial issues on the downstream associa - tions between obesity and obesity - related comorbidities , which can also independently impact on the course of the COVID - 19 infection . An additional question concerns differences between sexes . Even though data from the Global Health 50 / 50 research initiative identifies similar incidences ( cases ) of COVID - 19 in men and women , men have more unfavor - able outcomes and higher mortality rates in SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 14 ] . Several studies carried out in China and European countries show males are at higher risk for more severe disease outcomes and mortality [ 15 – 17 ] . This difference in severity and mortality between sexes has been hypothesized to be due to the higher prevalence of specific comorbidities in men , especially hypertension , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) [ 17 , 18 ] . Some studies high - light that male patients seem to be more vulnerable to the presence of comorbidities in COVID - 19 compared to female patients [ 19 ] . A specific mention to the relevance of gender , as opposed to sex as a biological variable , should be made here . Literature has highlighted for some time the impor - tance of considering both the biological - oriented per - spective of sex and the more psychosocially centered perspective of gender in clinical studies [ 20 ] . However , there are substantial challenges involved in obtaining gender - related information in quantitative studies using administrative databases . So , in this study we are assum - ing differences considering sex , as opposed to gender . It is still unclear how obesity and sex function as direct risk factors or through the mediation of comorbidities favoring worse outcomes in COVID - 19 . A better under - standing of differences in outcomes between sexes may support the development of risk classification tools and of treatment and prevention options for men and women [ 21 ] . Structural equation modeling ( SEM ) [ 22 ] allows for the simultaneous analysis of the dependence and inter - relationships between multiple variables . It estimates the direct effects and effects mediated by other factors that make up the causal network of the outcome of interest [ 22 ] . Path analysis is a special application of SEM [ 23 ] requiring large N - datasets . National health surveillance data samples obtained from countries with high inci - dence of COVID - 19 and well - structured administrative information systems , such as Brazil , provide an opportu - nity for initial explorations of links or pathways between explanatory variables and outcomes using this approach . The purpose of this study is , based on data recorded in Brazil , to assess mortality from COVID - 19 in people with obesity and to describe direct and indirect effects of age , BMI , and clinical variables , according to sex . Methods This observational , cross - sectional study was carried out using microdata from the Influenza Epidemio - logical Surveillance Information System , SIVEP - Gripe ( Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe - https : / / sivepgripe . saude . gov . br / sivepgripe / login . html ? 0 ) . The system is managed by the Brazilian Minis - try of Health , in partnership with the State and Municipal Health Secretariats and is used to monitor Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) of any cause ( influenza , COVID - 19 , other respiratory viruses and other or non - specified agents ) [ 24 ] . Reporting of all cases is mandatory Page 3 of 11 Reis dos et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1655 for every public and private healthcare provider in the country . The variables were selected from the individual record form - Case of Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave ( inpatient SRAG ) at SIVEP - Gripe [ 25 ] . The final study database included all confirmed cases of COVID - related severe acute respiratory syndrome reported between 02 / 21 / 2020 and 04 / 18 / 2021 in the SIVEP - Gripe original dataset featuring obese individuals aged 20 years and over , with recorded BMIs values for obesity ( BMI ≥ 30 kg / m 2 ) . Confirmation and reporting of cases followed criteria of the Epidemiological Surveillance Guide of the Healthy Ministry for COVID - 19 : clinical , clinical - epidemiological , clinical - imaging and laboratory criteria [ 25 ] . The final dataset used in the study will be provided upon reasonable request to the authors . As we were intending to compare differences between common variables according to sex , we excluded preg - nant and postpartum women . To allow us to maintain a large N - data set , we dropped variables initially consid - ered for the model with substantial missing information ( e . g . , years of school attendance as a social determinant ) . The goal of model specification is to identify a testable and useful model , even if it fails to account for all aspects of reality [ 23 , 26 ] . We performed an initial description of the variables using frequencies , percentages , odds ratio and 95 % confi - dence intervals stratified according to sex ( male / female ) . Variables considered included age , race / color ( regrouped as white / non - white ) , presence or absence of risk factors ( diabetes mellitus , chronic lung disease , asthma , chronic kidney disease and chronic cardiovascular disease ) , presence of obesity , BMI ( kg / m 2 ) , admission to the ICU ( yes / no ) , time from initial symptoms to final outcome ( in days ) based on dates informed in the database and clinical outcome ( cure / death ) [ 25 ] . There are no specific instructions for reporting the variable sex in SIVEP . It is probably based on assignment by the health care profes - sional filling in the SIVEP forms and not on self - report - ing [ 27 ] . To assess the direct and indirect associations of mor - tality from COVID - 19 in people with obesity according to sex , we developed a hypothetical model , considering observed variables with valid frequencies above 5 % and significance . The model tested through trajectory analysis ( Path Analysis ) [ 28 ] included the variables age , comorbidities ( chronic cardiovascular disease , diabetes , chronic renal disease and chronic respiratory disease ) and admis - sion to the ICU . Observed variables are represented by rectangles and classified as exogenous and endogenous . The endogenous variables were assigned measurement errors identified by “e” . Specifically , for this analysis , we considered BMI as a continuous variable . We estimated the parameters using asymptomatic distribution free method . The results were presented using direct and indi - rect standardized regression coefficients . We obtained the indirect standardized coefficients by multiplying the coefficients of the direct tracks among the variables . The goodness of fit of the models was evaluated according to the Chi - square test ( χ2 ) p > 0 . 05 ; Root Mean Error of Approximation ( RMSEA ) ≤ 0 . 05 ; Goodness of Fit Index ( GFI ) , Comparative Fit Index ( CFI ) and Tucker - Lewis Index ( TLI ) ≥ 0 . 95 [ 22 ] . To characterize the participants and analyze the data , BMI was categorized as : 30 . 0 to 34 . 9 ; 35 . 0 to 39 . 9 ; 40 . 0 to 49 . 9 and ≥ 50 . 0 kg / m 2 [ 29 ] . To determine the association of BMI with mortality according to sex , we used binary logistic regression adjusted for the variables age , comor - bidities , and admission to the ICU , with estimates of odds ratios ( ORs ) with the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) . Direct standardized coefficients and p - values were determined for all variables included in the model . A path coefficient indicates the direct effect of a variable assumed to be the cause on another variable , assumed to be the effect . Standardized coefficients allow for the comparison among the relative importance of different variables assessed by adjusting the standard deviations in such a way that , despite different units of measurement , all the variables have equal standard deviations . They are sample specific and cannot be compared across samples of studies . For logistic regression analyses , where coefficients allow comparisons across different data samples , we determined odds Ratio ( OR ) and confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) for the association of age and clinical variables with mortality from COVID - 19 among people with obe - sity , according to sex . We conducted all analyzes using IBM SPSS and IBM SPSS AMOS 24 . In accordance with Resolution 466 / 2012 of the Brazil - ian National Health Council , approval of the study by the Research Ethics Committee was not required , as it uses public open access unidentified data . Results During the study period , 1 , 048 , 576 individuals were reported in the SIVEP - Gripe inpatient database . Among the 50 , 197 reported as obese , BMIs in the expected range of 30 - 99 . 9 kg / m 2 were available for 13 , 494 ( 26 . 9 % ) . Our study dataset , considering the exclusion criteria , included 8 , 772 adults with a diagnosis of COVID - 19 - related SRAG and an available BMI value indicating obesity ( BMI > 30 ) . Table 1 shows the descriptive analysis of the variables according to sex . In our study population , 51 . 7 % were men and 52 . 1 % were white . Average age was 54 . 4 years Page 4 of 11 Reis dos et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1655 old ( SD = 15 . 02 ) and average BMI 35 . 5 ( SD = 6 . 09 ) kg / m 2 . Reported deaths amounted to 3 , 115 ( 35 . 5 % of patients ) , with similar mortality for males ( 35 . 7 % ) and females ( 35 . 4 % ) . Most patients had BMI in the range of 30 . 0 to 34 . 9 kg / m 2 ( n = 4 , 420 ; 50 . 4 % ) and were admitted to the ICU ( n = 4 , 447 ; 50 . 7 % ) . Regarding comorbidities , 49 . 7 % had chronic cardiovascular disease , 37 . 4 % diabetes mel - litus , 6 . 7 % asthma , 5 . 6 % chronic lung disease , and 5 . 4 % chronic kidney disease . Times from symptoms to out - comes did not differ between sexes ( Table 1 ) . Overall frequencies for other less frequent comor - bidities were neurologic disease ( 3 . 2 % ) ; blood disease ( 1 % ) ; Down´s syndrome ( 0 . 6 % ) ; liver disease ( 1 . 4 % ) ; and immune deficiency ( 2 . 7 % ) ( not shown ) . We performed path analyzes using models for male and female patients . Both models presented acceptable good - ness - of - fit indices ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Using standardized path coefficients and considering the outcome death ( Table 2 ) , the greatest direct effects in both men and women were related to admission to ICU ( 0 . 38 for men and 0 . 36 for women ) and age ( 0 . 20 for men and 0 . 23 for women ) . BMI showed a significant cor - relation to death in men ( 0 . 07 ) but not in women . Also , chronic cardiovascular disease was only significant in men , but shows a negative correlation ( - 0 . 04 ) . Since none of the coefficients exceeded one , we could conclude that there was no multicollinearity . In the model tested in men with obesity , older age ( β = 0 . 20 ) , higher BMI values ( β = 0 . 07 ) , admission to the ICU ( β = 0 . 38 ) , presence of diabetes mellitus ( β = 0 . 05 ) , chronic kidney disease ( β = 0 . 09 ) , chronic lung disease ( β = 0 . 05 ) and chronic cardiovascular disease ( β = - 0 . 04 ) were associated with death . For women with obesity , we identified a direct associa - tion between older age ( β = 0 . 23 ) . admission to the ICU ( β = 0 . 36 ) , presence of diabetes mellitus ( β = 0 . 06 ) , chronic kidney disease ( β = 0 . 07 ) , chronic lung disease ( β = 0 . 03 ) and death . BMI was indirectly associated and was medi - ated by admission to the ICU ( β = 0 . 012 ) . Logistic regression analysis after adjustment showed that age , diabetes , chronic kidney disease , chronic lung disease and admission to ICU were associated with death in patients of both sexes ( Table 3 ) . Chronic cardiovas - cular disease was only associated with death in male patients , with an OR of 0 . 81 ( 95 % CI = 0 . 70 – 0 . 94 ) . After adjustment for age , chronic cardiovascular disease , diabe - tes mellitus , chronic lung disease , chronic kidney disease and admission to ICU , elevated BMI was associated with death in both men and women ( Table 2 ) . Male patients with a BMI between 40 and 49 . 9 kg / m 2 and ≥ 50 . 0 kg / m 2 had greater chance of death when compared with those with a BMI between 30 kg / m 2 and 34 . 9 kg / m 2 , with ORs of 1 . 50 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 32 – 1 . 94 ) and 3 . 0 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 94 – 4 . 64 ) , respectively . In women , an association was found only for BMI ≥ 50 . 0 kg / m 2 , with 1 . 81 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 19 – 2 . 77 ) more chance of death compared to those with a BMI between 30 kg / m 2 and 34 . 9 kg / m 2 . ICU : Intensive Care Unit ; BMI : Body Mass Index . * Adjusted by all variables included in regression models . In the logistic regression analysis , where coefficients allow comparisons across different data samples , differ - ences between sexes in increased chances of dying were very similar in diabetes mellitus ( 32 % for men and 29 % for women ) but differed for chronic lung disease ( men 87 % and women 49 % ) and chronic kidney disease ( 132 % for men and 75 % for women ) . Worsening of the disease and admission to the ICU remained the biggest risk factor for mortality for people with obesity . Upon admission to ICU , the chance of dying increased 7 . 4 times in men and 5 . 88 times in women when compared to no admission to the ICU . Discussion Initial descriptions of frequencies for COVID - 19 mor - tality , disease duration and UCI use in our study did not hint at substantial differences between sexes . However , pathway analysis shows that obesity in men has a direct effect on COVID - 19 deaths , not mediated by comorbidi - ties . Obesity is , thus , a key factor in unfavorable COVID outcomes in men . On the other hand , we did not find this direct relationship of BMI and death in women . In Table 1 Characteristics of individuals with obesity with confirmed COVID - 19 - related severe acute respiratory syndrome , according to sex , Brazil , 2020 - 1 Variables Men ( n = 4 , 535 ; 51 . 7 % ) Women ( n = 4 , 237 ; 48 . 3 % ) Age in years , average , ( SD ) 52 . 3 ( 14 . 2 ) 56 . 7 ( 15 . 6 ) BMI in kg / m 2 , average ( SD ) 35 . 4 ( 5 . 9 ) 35 . 6 ( 6 . 3 ) Color / race White 2 , 340 ( 51 . 6 ) 2 , 228 ( 57 . 6 ) Non - white 2 , 195 ( 48 . 4 ) 2 , 008 ( 47 . 4 ) BMI , n ( % ) ( kg / m 2 ) 30 , 0 – 34 , 9 2 , 316 ( 51 . 1 ) 2 , 104 ( 49 . 7 ) 35 , 0 – 39 , 9 1 , 296 ( 28 . 6 ) 1 , 208 ( 28 . 5 ) 40 , 0 – 49 , 9 810 ( 17 . 9 ) 800 ( 18 . 9 ) ≥ 50 , 0 113 ( 2 . 5 ) 125 ( 3 . 0 ) Comorbidities n ( % ) Chronic Cardiovascular Disease 2 , 102 ( 46 . 4 ) 2 , 259 ( 53 . 3 ) Diabetes mellitus 1 , 540 ( 34 . 0 ) 1 , 737 ( 41 . 0 ) Chronic Kidney Disease 212 ( 4 . 7 ) 277 ( 6 . 5 ) Asthma 218 ( 5 . 6 ) 371 ( 10 . 8 ) Clinical course Symptoms to outcome ( days / SD ) 20 . 4 ( 15 . 2 ) 21 . 1 ( 16 . 4 ) ICU ( % ) Outcome ( % ) 2 , 413 ( 53 . 2 ) 2 , 034 ( 48 . 0 ) Death 1 , 617 ( 35 . 7 ) 1 , 498 ( 35 . 4 ) BMI : Body Mass Index ; SD : Standard deviation ; ICU : Intensive Care Unit Page 5 of 11 Reis dos et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1655 their case , death was indirectly related to co - morbidities and by the need for admission to the ICU . Comorbidities and admission to ICU seemed , thus , to be more “deci - sive” than obesity for the outcome death in COVID - 19 infected women . As shown in the logistic regression analyses , for women with BMIs in the extreme obesity range ( > 50 Kg / m 2 ) obesity increased the risk of COVID - 19 death by 69 % . Men in the same BMI range showed a three times higher magnitude of association ( 200 % ) . Men also evidenced an increased risk for COVID - 19 mortality at lower levels of obesity ( > 40 kg / m 2 ) compared to women . As the refer - ence for comparison in our study was the 30 – 35 kg / m 2 BMI range , the actual magnitude of the effect tends to be even greater . Previous studies using < 30 kg / m 2 BMI as reference showed increases in mortality of 27 % relative to mild obesity ( 30 – 35 kg / m 2 BMI ) [ 30 ] . Obesity alone is a more significant risk factor than cardiovascular disease and diabetes for in - hospital COVID - 19 mortality [ 31 ] and should be treated as a crucial biological factor [ 32 ] . This creates a very worri - some context in countries with high prevalence of obesity and where the pandemic remains out of control for long spells . Approximately 34 million Brazilians ≥ 50 years of age have at least one risk condition for severe COVID - 19 , obesity being among three most prevalent [ 33 ] . Current evidence already suggests the need to prioritize obese young individuals for vaccination should COVID - 19 per - sist as a recurrent seasonal infection [ 31 ] . Our study sug - gests the need for special emphasis on men . Male sex was also found to be an independent risk fac - tor for COVID - 19 disease in previous studies using Bra - zilian data [ 32 ] . The greater vulnerability of men with obesity to death from coronaviruses independently of other comorbidities calls for strengthening gender - ori - ented public - health recommendations concerning the risks of obesity [ 34 ] . In many countries , traditional gen - der perspectives on aesthetics undervalue and even dis - courage concerns over body weight in men . The quest for beauty , heavily linked to slimness , addresses mainly women . Public health strategies for obesity in men may , thus , pose greater challenges than in the case of women . The availability of consistent BMI information for little over one quarter of patients reported as obese in SIVEP - Gripe signals the need to emphasize the importance of this measurement . This would include training healh care professionals on how to measure BMI or on how to get quick information from online apps . As previously shown in a study on hypertension , in addition to minding gender differences in risk awareness , emphasis on measurement Fig . 1 Model of the association between body mass index and death for male patients with obesity diagnosed with Covid - 19 ( χ2 = 8 . 245 ; p = 0 . 311 ; RMSEA = 0 . 006 ; CFI = 0 . 999 ; GFI = 1 . 000 ; TLI = 0 . 998 ) Page 6 of 11 Reis dos et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1655 tends to favour a more adequate monitoring of risk fac - tors [ 35 ] . An unexpected finding in our study was the counter - intuitive result for risk of death from COVID - 19 found for obese men reporting chronic cardiovascular disease ( CCD ) . A recent study came to suggest a possible key role of cardiovascular disease in COVID - 19 by showing that the age pattern of the male - to - female ratio in mortality closely mirrors that of overall mortality from cardiovas - cular disease [ 36 ] . Several other studies also cite CCD as a risk factor in both men and women [ 37 ] . Previous Brazilian studies using the SIVEP - Gripe have nevertheless detected non - significant , negative , or dubi - ous impacts of CCD on COVID - 19 deaths . Souza et al . ( 2020 ) . used an adjusted Cox regression model to stab - lish associations of CCD with fatal outcomes in COVID - 19 and found a HR of 0 . 95 ( 0 . 93 – 0 . 98 ) [ 38 , 39 ] . Hallak et al . ( 2022 ) , using microdata for São Paulo found negative and statistically significant coefficients for heart disease in logistic regression models for death from COVID - 19 [ 32 ] . Another study in a São Paulo hospital analyzed a very stratified set of cardiovascular conditions in 2 , 675 patients to better understand associations between CCD and COVID - 19 deaths ( including hypertension , arrhythmias , coronary artery disease , previous myocar - dial infarction , cardiac surgery and valve and congenital heart diseases ) . It confirmed that none of them acted as independent risk factors for death [ 40 ] . Outside Brazil , a survey using a large UK National Health Service ( NHS ) dataset also showed that nei - ther diagnosed hypertension nor high blood pressure impacted patient´s outcomes in COVID . with marginal or small effects for other preexisting CCD [ 41 ] . All these findings suggest that the relevance of cardiovascular disease in unfavorable COVID - 19 outcomes may occur in the context of acute cardiovascular events developed in the course of the disease and not necessarily of pre - existing chronic heart conditions [ 40 ] . However , the contradictions between results in studies examining the relevance of cardiovascular disease in COVID - 19 sever - ity emphasize the need to revisit these relationships in future research to better understand the trends . Hypertension , atherosclerosis - related and other causes of chronic cardiovascular disease are grouped under the single variable CCD in the SIVEP - Gripe . Several stud - ies have shown possible differences in the contributions of hypertension [ 42 ] and other cardiovascular diseases to COVID - 19 severity [ 43 ] . Given the large N - data set Fig . 2 Model of the association between body mass index and death for female patients with obesity diagnosed with Covid - 19 ( χ2 = 8 . 245 ; p = 0 . 311 ; RMSEA = 0 . 006 ; CFI = 0 . 999 ; GFI = 1 . 000 ; TLI = 0 . 998 ) Page 7 of 11 Reis dos et al .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1655 in SIVEP - Gripe and its evident usefulness in clinical and epidemiological studies , being able to distinguish arterial hypertension from other CCDs would contribute to bet - ter illuminate the relationships between CCD and death in COVID - 19 [ 43 ] . The Mexican Epidemiologic Surveil - lance Database for Respiratory Viral diseases ( Sistema de Vigilancia Epidemiológica de Enfermedades Respira - torias Virales ) , for instance , distinguishes hypertension from cardiopathy . In a study using this specific database hypertension was associated with increased risk of death from COVID - 19 , whereas cardiopathy was not [ 44 ] . Literature confirms our regression analysis findings that age [ 45 , 46 ] , diabetes mellitus [ 47 – 49 ] , chronic kid - ney disease [ 50 , 51 ] , chronic lung disease [ 4 , 52 , 53 ] and admission to ICU [ 50 , 51 ] are all associated with COVID - 19 mortality in people with obesity of both sexes . For chronic lung disease the effect was modest but statisti - cally significant , with slight difference between sexes ( odds ratio varying from 1 . 5 for men to 1 . 6 in women ) . The greatest risk for adverse health outcomes was admission to the ICU [ 54 – 56 ] . Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) was the second most important independent risk factor for COVID - 19 mortality . It increased women´s risk by 39 % and by 149 % in men . This result supports the adoption in Brazil of special measures for COVID - 19 protection in dialysis environments during outbreaks [ 56 ] , wider use of screening to detect early - stage kidney disease and campaigns to inform the public and health professionals of increased vulnerability to severe Covid - 19 and other infections in CKD [ 57 ] . Differences in male vulnerability to COVID - 19 [ 32 ] and the many hypotheses concerning distinct demands , behaviors and ways of life incident upon men highlight the importance of considering the gender approach in future studies [ 20 , 58 ] . On the other hand , links between testosterone , obesity and responses to COVID - 19 emphasize biological aspects of the differences between sexes . The relationship between testosterone and COVID - 19 seems to be dependent upon the specific disease stage , but there is a well - stablished association Table 3 Odds Ratio ( OR ) and confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) for the association of age and clinical variables with mortality from COVID - 19 among people with obesity , according to sex .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1655 between low levels of testosterone , SARS - COV2 - induced oxidative stress and greater disease severity [ 59 ] . The obesity - associated hypotestosteronemia seen in moder - ate and severe male obesity [ 60 ] may thus predispose to worse outcomes in COVID - 19 . Obesity - associated hypotestosteronemia by itself leads to a vicious cycle of increasing adiposity . It remains a functional and reversible status but requires substan - tial weight loss to be reversed [ 60 ] . In moderate and severe obesity this may only be achievable by bariatric surgery or modern anti - obesity drugs . Therefore , one cannot overstate the importance of starting to manage overweight and mild obesity in primary care settings . Since 2009 there is a national program for men´s health improvement delivered at primary health care facilities in Brazil [ 61 ] . The inclusion of obesity control targets [ 62 ] in this program could contribute to developing gender - sensitive approaches to obesity . This study has limitations and strengths . The consid - erable number of missing data stands out as a limita - tion . Since filling instructions in administrative records are often not sufficiently precise by academic research standards , there are no guarantees regarding the con - trol of filling in the data and associated biases . Despite the adequate fit , our model is not unique and there may be other valid ways to explain the relationships under study . Additionally , since the interaction of COVID - 19 with other variables is still under study , erroneous causal relationships may have been established in the process of designing the hypothetical model . As strengths , we high - light the use of the large - N free access national database of hospitalized patients with COVID - 19 and the specific perspective of comparison between sexes adopted in our study . In conclusion , as short - term approaches in COVID outbreaks , our study supports strict protective mea - sures to avoid infection and priority vaccination in men with BMI > 40 kg / m 2 , especially in those with CKD and chronic lung disease . Longer - term public health recom - mendations would include systematic monitoring of BMI and fostering adequate gender sensitive approaches to the management of obesity in primary care .
