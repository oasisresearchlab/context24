To monitor how these contacts changed over the course of the pandemic in the Netherlands , a longitudinal survey was conducted where participants reported on their at - risk contacts every two weeks , as part of the European CoMix survey . The survey included 1659 participants from April to August 2020 and 2514 participants from December 2020 to September 2021 . We categorized the number of unique contacted persons excluding household members , reported per participant per day into six activity levels , deﬁned as 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 - 4 , 5 - 9 and 10 or more reported contacts . After correcting for age , vaccination status , risk status for severe outcome of infection , and frequency of participation , activity levels increased over time , coinciding with relaxation of COVID - 19 control measures . Introduction From early 2020 onwards , the COVID - 19 outbreak grew into a global pandemic , taking only a few months to affect nearly all countries worldwide . SARS - CoV - 2 virus that causes COVID - 19 is transmitted between persons during contact events with physical proximity , i . e . at - risk contacts . Reducing transmission with non - pharmaceutical measures can be achieved by lowering the transmission probability per contact , e . g . by maintaining a safe distance from each other or using protective equipment such as a face mask , and by reducing the number of contacts per person , e . g . by closing schools , theaters and restaurants , teleworking or inviting fewer people at home . In the Netherlands , the ﬁrst nation - wide lockdown was imposed on March 15th , 2020 involving all of the above measures . It was lifted stepwise on May 11th ( partly opening of schools ) , June 2nd ( further opening of schools , museums and terraces open a . o . ) and July 6th ( bars and restaurants open a . o . ) . The rise of the Alpha variant in winter 2020 / 2021 called for an even stricter lockdown including an evening curfew . The measures were relaxed from April 28th , 2021 onwards as vaccination coverages were increasing . It is not known how the change in control measures affected the number of at - risk contacts in the Dutch general population . To learn about the effect of control measures on contact behaviour , many countries set up contact surveys 1 – 8 . The POLYMOD study 9 served as a blueprint for these as it did for many pre - COVID - 19 studies 10 . But while these pre - COVID - 19 studies aimed to measure ‘normal’ contact behaviour , the unprecedented measures that were taken during the pandemic gave a unique opportunity to determine contact behaviour under restricted conditions . As part of a European project , the CoMix contact survey was set up in March / April 2020 in Belgium , the UK , and the Netherlands , later followed by 19 other European countries 11 . In this contact study , participants were asked to regularly report their contact behaviour , i . e . the number of unique persons they had contact with in certain locations on the day preceding the survey day , as well as some characteristics of the contacted persons such as age and sex . Participants were asked to report only at - risk contacts , speciﬁcally face - to - face conversational contacts ( within 1 . 5 meters ) and / or physical contacts . What sets the CoMix survey apart from other contact surveys is that it uses a standardised questionnaire in multiple countries and is repeated at regular intervals in the same .

At the same time the CoMix survey started , a large - scale population - based SARS - CoV - 2 serosurveillance study was initiated in the Netherlands 12 , 13 . This Pienter Corona ( PiCo ) study was repeated every 4 to 6 months in a representative sample of the Dutch population involving a few thousand participants of all ages per survey round , and is still ongoing . It also included a contact question where the participants were asked to report the number of unique persons they contacted the day before in speciﬁc age groups . An early analysis of the ﬁrst two survey rounds in 2020 showed that the ﬁrst lockdown decreased the number of community contacts per participant on average by 76 % compared to pre - COVID behaviour 4 . The PiCo survey rounds are too far apart to closely monitor the contact behaviour over time , but will be used to validate the CoMix survey results at certain points in time . Our aim is to describe how control measures affected the contact behaviour of the Dutch general population , using the CoMix data that was collected in the Netherlands during the survey periods in 2020 and 2021 . Although contacts with household members are thought to be more intensive than contacts with non - household members , they are not subject to any of the control measures . For this reason , we will focus on the number of contacts per participant outside the household because these can be affected by the control measures . As a validation , the results are compared to four survey rounds of the PiCo survey that coincided with the CoMix study periods . Methods CoMix participant recruitment and survey design in the Netherlands This contact survey was part of the CoMix study that was conducted in several EU countries and the UK 11 . Participants were recruited by the market research company Ipsos - MORI , and ﬁlled out the contact survey online . The study was carried out in two survey periods : 8 survey rounds from 16 April to 5 August 2020 , referred to as the 2020 series , and 20 survey rounds from 23 December 2020 to 22 September 2021 , referred to as the 2021 series . At the start of the 2020 series , 1500 participants of 18 years and older were recruited , reﬂecting the age distribution of the Dutch population . An overall drop - out rate of 10 % per round was allowed , otherwise additional participants were recruited for the following rounds . However , the drop - out rates differed per age group leading to very few participants in the youngest age group of 18 - 24 in the last rounds of the 2020 series ( Fig 1 ) . For this reason , a preferential sampling scheme was adopted at the start of the 2021 series , oversampling the younger age groups . In total 1200 participants of 18 years and older were included and additionally 300 children between 0 and 17 years of age were included by asking adult participants to ﬁll out the contact survey for one of their children . After 10 rounds , the age cohorts were supplemented to include 1500 participants in total again in May 2021 . The contact survey was repeated every two weeks and a survey round lasted at most 7 days , except for the survey rounds where many new participants were recruited that were allowed more time to ﬁll out the questionnaire . In each survey round participants were asked about characteristics that can change over time , such as risk perception , risk status and - in the 2021 series - vaccination status against COVID - 19 . High risk participants were people with self - reported chronic respiratory disease , chronic heart disorder , chronic kidney disease , diabetes , reduced resistance to infection ( due to illness or medication ) , morbid obesity ( BMI over 40 ) , and pregnant women , i . e . reﬂecting the medical indication for inﬂuenza vaccination . Missing data in the risk status of a participant were completed with the most common risk status reported over the survey rounds by the participant . The risk status of participants could change by survey round . The fraction of high risk participants is calculated per age group using only the participants with unambiguous risk status , and compared to the population fraction with a medical indication for inﬂuenza vaccination 14 . The 2021 series coincided with the roll - out of the COVID - 19 vaccination campaign . Health care workers , persons with a high medical risk and care home residents were vaccinated with priority , while the non - risk groups were vaccinated from elderly to young . Most persons were vaccinated with either BionTech / Pﬁzer , Moderna or to a smaller extent Janssen vaccine by the Municipal Health Services , except for 60 - 64 year olds who were vaccinated at an early stage with AstraZeneca by their general practitioner . Participants are considered to be vaccinated after they have reported to have had at least one vaccination dose . The fraction of vaccinated participants is compared to the vaccination coverage of one vaccine dose in the general population over time 15 . In the main part of the survey , participants reported their contact behaviour of the previous day . For each unique person they had conversational or physical contact with between 5am on the previous day and 5am of the survey day , participants ﬁlled out the characteristics of the contacted person , such as age group and gender , as well as duration and location of the contact event . Multiple contact events with the same person were to be considered as one contact , and only contact events with a close physical proximity were to be reported , i . e . excluding online or phone contacts . Besides these individual contacts , it was also possible to report group contacts from the third survey round onwards in late May 2020 . Group contacts were reported as the total number of contacted persons in broad age groups ( 0 - 17 , 18 - 64 , 65 + ) at work , school or another location .

Only contacts with non - household members are included , as these are most likely to change over the course of the study period . Twelve occasions were excluded where participants reported more than 1000 contacts in a single survey round , and 58 participants were excluded that participated in four or more rounds but did not report any contact . These excluded participants did not have a signiﬁcantly different age than the included participants , but they did have a signiﬁcantly smaller household size . The distribution of the number of contacts per participant per round had a heavy tail , which can result in unstable estimates of the variance 18 . Instead of using a parametric distribution , we deﬁne activity levels of 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 - 4 , 5 - 9 , ≥ 10 contacts per participant per round and analyse these using ordinal regression . The activity levels are used as variables of a generalised additive model with ﬁxed effects for participant vaccination status , participant risk status , weekends and ( school ) holidays , cubic splines for calendar time , participant age , participant round ( i . e . the n th time a participant participated ) , and a random intercept for each participant . The statistical model can be described as : Pr ( activity ≤ l ) = Φ [ θ l − ( β id + β 0 + β 1 ∗ s ( date ) + β 2 ∗ s ( part _ round ) + β 3 ∗ s ( part _ age ) + β 4 ∗ part _ vacc + β 5 ∗ part _ risk + β 6 ∗ weekend + β 7 ∗ holiday ) ] , where Φ is the logistic function , θ l are the thresholds for the activity levels l , β id are the random intercepts and the s ( ) function indicates that splines are used . The ﬁts are assessed by explained deviance and by comparing the ﬁtted activity levels to the observations . Next , the ﬁtted results are used in a synthetic population that has the same size as the study population , but reﬂects the general population , with respect to age 19 , risk status 14 and vaccination status 15 at each day of the study periods . Participant id’s are sampled with replacement from the study population , and participant round is set to 1 for each day during the study period . 200 parameter sets are sampled from the estimated model parameters , and combined with 200 synthetic populations , to capture both the uncertainty of the model parameters and the uncertainty caused by the sample size of the study population . As a validation , the predicted activity levels of the synthetic population are compared to the activity levels measured in PiCo survey rounds 1 ( Apr 2020 ) , 2 ( Jun 2020 ) , 4 ( Feb 2021 ) and 5 ( Jun 2021 ) . All analyses are performed in R version 4 . 1 . 3 20 using the mgcv package 21 with family ocat for ordered categorical variables . Code is available on Github 22 , and data is published on Zenodo 23 in the standardised format of socialcontactdata . org . Results Study population In total , 1659 participants were included in the 2020 series , and 2514 participants in the 2021 series . Participants were equally distributed over men and women in 2020 , while female participants were slightly overrepresented in 2021 ( Tab . 1 ) . Household sizes of 2 persons were most common ( Tab . 1 ) . Each series started with a target population of 1500 participants , and the number of participants declined in each survey round ( Tab ? ? , Fig ? ? ) . In 2020 the drop - out rate was on average 4 % per round in the oldest age group and 14 % in the youngest age group ; in 2021 drop out rates were more comparable for all age groups ( Fig . 1A ) . The fraction of self - reported high risk adult participants was higher than in the general population , especially in the 2020 series ( Fig . 1B ) . The vaccination coverage of the study population increased over time largely in agreement with the general population ( Fig . 1C ) . The participants in the age groups of 18 - 34 years achieved a higher vaccination coverage at an earlier stage than the general population . The participants in the age group of 65 years and older lagged behind the general population . Contact behaviour The distribution of the number of contacts reveals that the adult and elderly age groups in both series exhibit heavy tails ( Fig . 2 ) . The ﬁtted lines on log - log scale ( inset in 2 ) for these four groups have slopes ranging from - 1 . 1 to - 1 . 5 . These values indicate that the estimates of the sample mean are stable but the estimates of the sample variance are not 18 , which makes the choice to model the number of contacts with a parametric distribution less obvious . The number of contacts in the child age group lacks a heavy tail , because of the abundance of children reporting contact numbers in the range of a class size . The numbers of contacts per participant per round are categorized in activity levels of 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 - 4 , 5 - 9 , ≥ 10 contacts per participant per round . Separate analyses are carried out for the different series and age groups . Of the ﬁxed effects only the weekends signiﬁcantly reduces the activity levels in all analyses ( Tab . ? ? ) . For the youngest age group , also holidays signiﬁcantly reduce the activity levels as they also include school holidays . Activity levels increase over time during the two series , indicating that the underlying number of non - household contacts per participant increases ( Fig . ? ? ) , corresponding to the lifting of COVID - 19 control measures . In all analyses the activity levels decrease with participant round . This means that participants tend to report fewer contacts the more often they participate . This is especially the case for the ﬁrst few rounds , after which the effect stabilises . 3 / 11 .

Using these model results the ﬁtted activity levels in the study population are compared to the data ( Fig . 3 ) . With the exception of some rounds , notably the ﬁrst round in 2020 and the fourth round in 2021 , the ﬁtted activity levels agree well with the observed activity levels . Next , the model results are extrapolated to the general population over the full course of the study periods ( Fig . 4 ) . The saw - tooth pattern is caused by the weekend effect , which is largest for the 0 - 17 age group . Over time activity levels generally increase in all age groups in both series ( Fig . 4 ) . As a comparison , the results of the PiCo study 4 are plotted , of which rounds 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 fell within the CoMix study periods . Participants of the PiCo study reported higher activity levels than CoMix participants . The discrepancy is largest for the 0 - 17 age group , whereas the 65 + age group all but agrees with the PiCo study results . Discussion In this paper we showed how the number of at - risk contacts per person outside the household increased as the COVID - 19 control measures were lifted in the Netherlands , based on the Dutch data of the European CoMix survey . These ﬁndings are consistent with those found in the PiCo studies , even though the activity levels reported in the PiCo data are higher than in the CoMix data . The two studies differed in how the participants report their contacts . In the CoMix study contacts were reported individually with a lot of detail on location , duration , distance from contact , protection measures , etc . Also for the group contacts at work , school , or other places additional details were requested . In the PiCo study a participant reported the total number of contacts in speciﬁc age classes , which made reporting many contacts easier . This may partly explain the higher activity levels found in the PiCo study . Participants tend to report fewer contacts when they participate in more rounds . This fatigue effect is also seen in the CoMix data of other countries , but the fatigue effect in the Netherlands is found to be extreme compared to these 24 . A complicating factor in interpreting the fatigue effect is that the participant rounds are not equally distributed over the study period . Most participants have their ﬁrst participant round in survey round 1 in 2020 , and survey rounds 1 and 11 in 2021 , due to the study design . In an alternative design used in the UK , the study population is supplemented to reach the target size in every survey round , which leads to a better distibution of the participant rounds over the survey rounds 17 . Also , a lower frequency of the survey rounds may lead to a smaller fatigue effect , but this would conﬂict with the aim of monitoring contact behaviour close to real time . To extrapolate our ﬁndings to the general population , the fatigue effect needed to be corrected for , and differences between the study population and the general population had to be taken into account . Particularly the age distribution of the study participants varied over the survey rounds , because drop - out rates differed between age groups . Also vaccination and risk status of the participants did not always reﬂect the vaccination and risk status in the general population . The participants in the age groups of 18 - 34 years achieved a higher vaccination coverage at an earlier stage than the general population . This could indicate that these groups contained relatively many health care workers , who were vaccinated with priority and may have a higher willingness to get vaccinated . The participants in the age group of 65 years and older lagged behind the general population , because the study population probably did not contain many care home residents who were vaccinated with priority . The fraction of high risk adult participants was higher than in the general population . The risk status was reported by participants themselves and compared to the fraction of the population that is invited for the annual inﬂuenza vaccination . Although the high risk deﬁnition is the same for both populations , participants may have assessed their risk status differently than their GP would . This is supported by the ﬁnding that the high risk participants are mainly overrepresented in the highest age groups in 2020 ( Fig . 1B , Tab . 1 ) when risks may have been perceived to be higher than in 2021 when mass - vaccination against COVID - 19 was implemented . This would explain the discrepancy , but it cannot be excluded that they were really high risk participants . Our ﬁndings suggest that the contact data collected in the CoMix survey describe trends in contact behaviour in the general population . As such it can be useful in monitoring the effect of control measures that are aimed at contact reduction 17 , 25 , 26 , describe determinants for contact behaviour 27 , 28 , or serve as input for infectious disease models 29 – 31 . These results can help guide policy in future waves of COVID - 19 or other emerging respiratory diseases by monitoring the interaction between contact behaviour , control measures and complicance , and emphasize that contact surveys such as the CoMix study are indispensable for providing a quantitative basis to public health policy .

Characteristics of study population , compared to general population . A Number of participants included per survey round in the 2020 and 2021 series , by age group . After 10 survey rounds in May 2021 , the study population was supplemented to meet the target numbers of the ﬁrst survey round again . B The fraction of high risk participants of the 2020 and 2021 series ( points with 95 % conﬁdence interval ) , and of the general population 14 ( bars ) . Only participants with unambiguous risk status are included . C Vaccination coverage in 2021 per age group of the study population ( points with 95 % conﬁdence interval ) and of the general population 15 ( line ) . The dashed line denotes the average date when non - risk groups were invited for vaccination . The dashed line for the 55 - 64 age group is in fact the average for 55 - 59 year olds , as 60 - 64 year olds were invited by their general practitioner . 8 / 11 .

Fitted and observed activity levels over time by series ( columns ) and age group ( rows ) . Activity levels are shown as the fraction of participants that report more than a certain number of non - household contacts per day . With ﬁve limits ( > 0 , > 1 , > 2 , > 4 and > 9 ) six activity levels are deﬁned , e . g . the fraction between the limits of > 2 and > 4 is the activity level that represents 3 or 4 contacts per participant . The model ﬁts per round are shown by the median ( lines ) and 95 % interval ( shaded ) , from the ﬁrst to last participation date of that survey round . The observed activity levels per round ( open circles ) are placed at the mean participation date of that survey round . Holidays and school holiday periods are shaded in grey . 10 / 11 .
