Since then , actin has been found in virtually all eukaryotic cells . What functions do microfilaments perform ? Studies in animal cells have provided us with a picture of F - actin as the backbone of many structurally and function - ally diverse assemblies coexisting within any given cell . Mi - crofilaments are important for cell shape determination , cell motility , and various contractile activities , as well as for par - ticipating in aspects of transmembrane signaling , endocyto - sis , and perhaps secretion . Since some actin - binding pro - teins are regulated by changes in free Ca : + , phospholipids , and by phosphorylation ( 75 ) , and microfilament organiza - tions can be modulated by small G - proteins ( 69 , 70 ) , mi - crofilaments seem to be under exquisite control . Moreover , recent discoveries that some actin - binding proteins contain SI - I2 and SH3 domains ( 56 ) suggest that microfilaments are integrated into protein - protein signaling pathways . Given these diverse and sophisticated regulatory systems , the gap in our knowledge of the precise functions performed by mi - crofilaments is all the more distressing . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has recently become very popular for studying the function of microfila - ments . Why ? Yeast cells are nonmotile and they have a rigid cell wall , do not change shape rapidly , and have no obvious surface structures . Therefore , some of the roles that mi - crofilaments play in vertebrate cells are not seen in yeast , yet microfilaments are vital because yeast contains a single essential actin gene ( 73 ) . The regulation of F - actin distribu - tion during the cell cycle in yeast was the first indication that microfilaments might play a role in cellular morphogenesis ( 41 ) ; that is , in the targeting of secretory vesicles for the as - sembly of the daughter cell rather than providing an infra - structure for it . This immediately raised a number of ques - tions : how is the distribution of F - actin determined , what are the components that make up these microfilamentous struc - tures , and what are their functions ? The relative ease of genetic approaches for the identification and analysis of functionally related components , together with the near reli - gious belief that what is true for S . cerevisiae is also fun - damentally true for Homo sapiens , has driven this popular - ity . This review seeks to convey the view that the relative Address all correspondence to Anthony Bretscher , Section of Biochemistry , Molecular and Cell Biology , Biotechnology Building , Cornell University , Ithaca , NY 14853 .

These results will complement and contribute to studies of mi - crofilaments in higher eucaryotes . Regulation of Microfilaments during the Cell Cycle In the vertebrate cell cycle , microfilaments reorganize as cells round up for mitosis and later they provide the contrac - tile force during cytokinesis . In yeast , we shall restrict our discussion to some of the events and changes in microfila - ment distribution ( Fig . 1 ) necessary for the assembly of a bud . Bud site selection is regulated because haploids show axial budding , whereas diploids show bipolar budding ( reviewed in references 25 , 53 ) . Several nonessential genes ( including BUD1 / RSRI , BUD2 - 5 ) provide the signal that directs cyto - skeletal polarization to the proper site , but they are not re - quired for bud site assembly or bud emergence ( 15 ) . Bud site selection seems to involve a G - protein signal transduction pathway . Budl / Rsrlp is a ras - like GTPase ; Bud5p is a GDP exchange factor ; and Bud2p has GAP activity on Budlp ( 11 , 14 , 66 ) . Next , genes involved in bud site assembly and bud emergence are required for normal polarization of the cyto - skeleton to the prebud site . Mutations in these genes ( includ - ing CDC24 , CDC42 , CDC43 , and BEMI - 3 ) result in failure of the cells to bud and they arrest as large unbudded cells with a randomized actin distribution ( 5 ) . This assembly pro - cess also involves a GTPase cycle because Cdc42p is a ras - like GTPase and Cdc24p encodes a protein similar to GDP exchange factors . Moreover , Bem3p is related to mammalian rho - GAP and may be specific for Cdc42p ( 82 ) . Cdc43p is a subunit of a protein geranylgeranyl transferase likely to be required for modification , membrane localization , and func - tion of Cdc42p ( 57 ) . Thus , CDC42p seems to be a key regu - lator that controls bud site assembly and microfilament po - larization . There may be some interplay between bud site selection , assembly , and actin localization because over - expression of Cdc42p , Bud5p , or certain actin binding pro - teins , such as Abplp , can alter bud site selection . The ras - related genes RH01 , Rtt03 , and Rlt04 have also been implicated in governing cytoskeletal polarity . Condi - tional rhol mutants arrest as small - budded cells under re - strictive conditions . Rholp colocalizes with actin cortical patches during bud formation and growth ; this distribution Â© The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 94 / 08 / 821 / 5 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cel ! Biology , Volume 126 , Number 4 , August 1994 821 ~ 825 821 Figure 1 . Localization of actin by immunofluorescence mi - croscopy through the cell cy - cle in wild - type diploid yeast . In G1 , the unbudded cell selects a specific prebud site , and then a ring of actin patches forms at this site . Secretion is directed toward the prebud site and bud emer - gence begins . Cortical actin patches associated with plasma membrane invagina - tions ( 61 ) redistribute to sites of new cell wall growth with bundles of actin filaments Cca - bles " ) extending from them into the mother cell . During S and G2 , actin cables are aligned toward the bud where patches are localized ( 41 ) ; secretion remains directed to - ward the bud . Growth at the bud tip predominates in the early budded phase , whereas isotropic growth occurs later as the bud enlarges . During mitosis , actin patches redis - tribute to the surface of the mother and bud . Before cytokinesis , patches relocate to the mother - bud neck and secretion is targeted to this re - gion for formation of the chitinous septum , which will ultimately remain as a bud scar on the mother and daugh - ter cells . is lost in cdc42 mutants ( 83 ) . Loss of both RH03 and RH04 products generates cells with randomized actin and delocal - ized chitin . Since these defects are suppressed by overexpres - sion of the CDC42 and BEM1 genes ( 55 ) , the combined results suggest that the RHO gene products act after the initi - ation of bud formation and determination of cell polarity specified by the Cdc42p pathway . Changes in microfilament distribution are correlated to Cdc28p kinase activation by distinct cyclins at specific times during the cycle ( 46 ) . Altering Cdc28p activity affects mor - phogenesis and the distribution of microfilaments during the yeast cell cycle at three specific stages ( 47 ) . Activation of Cdc28p by the G1 cyclins ( CLN1 , 2 , or 3 ) in unbudded GI cells is required for polarization of the cortical actin cy - toskeleton to the specified prebud site . This occurs in the absence of de novo protein synthesis and may be mediated by direct protein phosphorylation . One candidate substrate is the newly identified MAP kinase homologue , Slt2 / Mpklp , because defects in this protein enhance the phenotype of cdc28 mutants . Moreover , slt2 mutants display an altered ac - tin distribution and accumulate secretory vesicles and mem - branes , indicating that the kinase is important for establish - ing cell polarity ( 58 ) . Activation of Cdc28p by the mitotic cyclins ( CLB / , 2 ) in G2 cells is required for the depolariza - tion of the cortical actin cytoskeleton that results in the shift from apical to isotropic bud growth . Cdc28p inactivation by cyclin destruction in mitosis appears to be necessary for redistribution of cortical actin to the mother - bud neck region and assembly of the actin structures required for cytokinesis . There are parallels between thefindings in yeast and studies in higher cells . Since small G - proteins also modulate growth factor - induced microfilament rearrangements in ani - mal cells ( 69 , 70 ) , the regulation of cytoskeletal remodeling might be quite similar in yeast and animal cells . Also , Cdc28p - related kinases and cyclins control both the yeast and animal cell cycles , but how they regulate microfilament organizations is not yet clear ; the emerging studies in yeast should be helpful . Actins , Myosins , and Microfilament - associated Proteins Saccharomyces has a single essential conventional actin gene , ACT / , that encodes a protein 88 % identical to rabbit ol - actin . Actlp is biochemically and functionally similar to conventional vertebrate actins ( 42 , 62 ) . An unconventional actin that is 47 % identical to a - act . in is encoded by another essential gene , ACT2 ( 72 ) . Little is known about the function of Act2p . Since unconventional actins have been found as - sociated with microtubule - based functions in higher cells ( 19 , 45 ) , an analysis of Act2p function should be very in - teresting . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 126 , 1994 822 The distribution of actin points to a role for microfilaments in polarized secretion of cell wall components , and the phenotypes ofacd mutants support this . act1 mutants , many of which have conditional lethal phenotypes , have been made by random ( 74 ) or directed mutagenesis ( 16 , 21 , 22 , 38 , 81 ) . Mutant phenotypes provide a direct test for functions of actin in yeast . Various actin mutations disrupt cell shape , cell polarity , secretion , endocytosis ( 43 ) , spindle orientation ( 65 ) , nuclear migration , cytokinesis , and mitochondrial dis - tribution ( 26 ) . Yeast contains at least three myosins . The MY01 product is a conventional myosin II that is found at the bud neck , sug - gesting a role in cytokinesis ( 78 ) . Cells lacking Myolp form chains or clusters of cells because they are defective in sep - turn formation . In addition , loss of the Myolp results in diffuse chitin deposition , enlarged cell size , a subtle bud site selection defect , accumulation of membranes , and a ten - dency to lyse , perhaps suggesting additional functions for this myosin ( 71 ) . The essential putative two - headed non - filamentous myosin , encoded by MY02 ( 39 ) , is related to the mouse dilute locus and brain myosin V . Members of this family differ from myosin II in that the head has a slightly different sequence , the neck region binds several calmodulin molecules followed by a short u - helical coiled - coil region , and the tail terminates in a large globular domain ( 28 ) . The MY02 gene was uncovered in a screen for conditional mu - tants that produced large cells ; possible functions of Myo2p are discussed below . A second , nonessential , dilute - like my - osin encoded by MY04 also exists in yeast ( 33 ) . A screen for multicopy suppressors of the myo2 tempera - ture sensitivity identified SMY1 , an unusual kinesin - like gene ( 48 ) . SMY1 is not essential for yeast growth , but disruption of SMY1 in the myo2 conditional mutant is lethal . Smylp , like Myo2p ( 12 ) , concentrates at sites of cell growth in wild - type cells ( 49 ) . As microtubules are not known to be involved in directed growth in yeast , it is an intriguing finding that a pro - tein related to microtubule - based motors appears to perform a function related to Myo2p . A full repertoire of proteins , many related to those of ver - tebrate cells , that bind to and modulate actin filaments has been discovered in yeast . A full discussion of these proteins and the genes that encode them has recently appeared ( 79 ) , and so only a brief overview will be given here . These pro - teins include actin - binding protein ( ABPI : 23 , 24 ) , tro - pomyosin , ( TPM / : 50 - 52 ) , funbrin ( SAC6 : 3 , 4 , 6 , 23 ) , cofllin ( COFI : 37 , 60 ) , capping protein ( CAP1 , CAP2 : 8 - 10 ) , and profilin ( PFY / : 31 , 32 , 54 , 77 ) . Genetic approaches have also uncovered several genes ( SAC1 - 7 , RAHI - 3 , SLAI , SLA2 , SLC1 , SLC2 , and ANC1 - 4 : 18 , 20 , 27 , 35 , 40 , 64 , 76 , 80 ) en - coding novel proteins potentially important for microfila - ment function . Some of these have domains that are related to proteins of higher cells , such as SLA / , which encodes a protein having three SH3 domains , and SLA2 , which shows homology to the COOH terminus of talin . As in vertebrate cells , these proteins associate with specific microfilamentous structures . For example , tropomyosin is a component of the actin cables ; Abpl , cofilin , and capping protein are found in cortical patches ; and fimbrin associates with both cables and patches . Considerable effort has been devoted to studying the phenotypes of strains having mutations in these genes . In some cases , disruption of the gene shows no phenotype ( e . g . , ABP / ) , whereas other disruptions are either lethal ( e . g . , COF1 ) or show reduced growth rate , an altered actin cyto - skeleton , and aberrant cell morphologies ( e . g . , TPM / , SAC6 , CAP1 , CAP2 , PFY1 , ANC1 , SLAI , SLA2 , SLC1 , SLC2 ) , sug - gestive of abnormal cell growth . How many different processes are these microfilament - associated proteins in - volved in ? Since most of the eytoskeletal proteins are en - coded by single nonessential genes , it is informative to ask if combinations of mutations in different genes are lethal , which could indicate that they participate in an essential pro - cess ( 7 , 76 ) . By this accounting , more than half a dozen dis - tinct essential functions are indicated ; a major challenge is to determine precisely what these are . Membrane Tra ~ icking and Targeting Correct targeting of secretory vesicles that carry plasma membrane proteins , periplasmic enzymes , and materials needed to build the cell wall is required for the growth of buds in growing cells and the development of " shmoo " projections in mating cells . The large , round morphology of conditional - lethal act1 mutants suggests that inappropriate growth occurs in the mother cell rather than being targeted to the bud . Whereas most of the chitin in wild - type cells is concentrated at the bud neck and remains as a " bud scar " af - ter cell division ( 13 , 34 ) , the chitin in the act1 - 1 mutant is dis - tributed randomly on the cell surface when the cells are grown at a restrictive temperature ( 63 ) , again suggesting a defect in targeting of secretory vesicles . As may be expected , actin cables are not detected in act1 - 1 mutants at the restric - tive temperature , and cortical patches are randomly dis - tributed throughout both mother and bud ( 63 ) . The distribu - tion of cortical patches in both wild - type cells and act1 mutants is consistent with the belief that it is the location of these structures that determines the sites of secretion and polarized growth ( 1 , 47 ) . As actin cables frequently appear to terminate on cortical patches , they may guide secretory vesicles to their site of fusion with the plasma membrane . Furthermore , actl mutants have a partial defect in the secre - tion of the periplasmic enzyme invertase , and they accumu - late abundant vesicles that resemble secretory vesicles accu - mulated by mutants having a block late ( post - Golgi ) in the secretory pathway ( 63 ) . The conditional myo2 - 66 mutation confers a phenotype similar to that of act1 mutants and indicates a role for this myosin in secretion and polarized cell growth ( 39 ) . At the restrictive temperature , large round cells with vesicles are formed . Interestingly , the myo2 - 66 mutant is lethal in combi - nation ( synthetically lethal ) with mutations in many of the SECgenes that function late in the secretory pathway , but not with those SEC genes that function at earlier steps , which implies an involvement in the late part of the pathway ( 30 ) . Myo2p localizes mostly to regions of active surface growth , further implicating it in directed growth ( 12 , 49 ) . The mor - phological defects of the myo2 - 66 mutant ( 39 ) are very simi - lar to those in tpm / mutants ( 52 ) . Both strains accumulate vesicles , but surprisingly , no significant accumulation of the secretory protein invertase is found . Epistasis results suggest that the vesicles in the tpm / mutant are derived from the nor - mal secretory pathway . It is likely that the accumulated vesi - cles in the tpm / and myo2 - 66 strains are the same because these two mutations show synthetic lethality ( 52 ) . One way to reconcile the lack of accumulation of invertase with a de - fect in secretion is to suggest that two parallel pathways exist Bretscher et al . Microfilament Functions in Yeast 823 between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane . Both pathways would depend on the late SEC gene products , yet one , not carrying invertase , would be facilitated by Tpmlp and Myo2p . It may be that invertase - containing vesi - cles function in a bulk delivery pathway , whereas vesicles carrying components for cell wall synthesis have to be targeted more precisely . The latter vesicles may fuse in - efficiently at inappropriate locations on the cell surface and therefore accumulate . Since different components are re - quired at different stages of the cell cycle , it is possible that the composition of these vesicles varies as the actin cytoskel - eton reorganizes during the cell cycle . It is not yet known if defects in other cytoskeletal proteins result in the accumula - tion of vesicles , but mutations in many of these genes give rise to characteristically large round cells , suggestive of mis - targeting . Purification of the vesicles accumulated in cyto - skeletal mutants and an analysis of their cargo should help to elucidate their role in cellular morphogenesis . The concept that myosins directly transport vesicles ( or or - ganelles ) was originally suggested by cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells and , more recently , by the movement of vesicles from Acanthamoeba or from extruded giant axons along ac - tin cables ( 2 , 44 ) . Lately , much attention has focused on Myo2p - related proteins . The mouse dilute mutations affect a myosin in this class ( 59 ) . Severe alleles result in neurologi - cal seizures and death , while milder alleles are characterized by light - coat color resulting from a defect in transport of melanin - containing vesicles . Chicken brain myosin V , a homologue of the mouse dilute protein , is also proposed to function in vesicle transport ( 17 , 28 ) . Recently , microfilaments have been implicated in the first step in receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis in yeast . Certain conditional act1 alleles are conditional for receptor - mediated or - factor uptake , and cells lacking fimbrin are completely defective ( 43 ) . Additionally , a mutation iso - lated on the basis of a defect in endocytosis defines END4 and turns out to be identical to SLA2 ( Riezman , H . , personal communication ) , a gene found independently as being essen - tial in the absence of Abpl ( 35 ) . The requirement of micro - filaments for endocytosis from the apical aspect of polarized epithelial cells ( 29 ) and in yeast is striking . Perspectives During the last few years , a large number of genes encoding proteins important for microfilament organization and func - tion , many related to those in animal cells , have been identified in yeast . Analysis of the functions of these proteins is still in its infancy , but roles for microfilaments in vesicular trafficking and targeting , as well as in endocytosis are begin - ning to emerge . Moreover , the ability to introduce specific mutations into any desired gene allows one to explore the consequences of precise alterations in vivo and in vitro . The use of genetics will allow suspected relationships to be tested and unexpected ones to be revealed . Together with biochem - ical and cell biological approaches , this will surely lead to an understanding of the roles of microfilaments in yeast and suggest important avenues for furthering our knowledge about microfilament function in animal cells .
