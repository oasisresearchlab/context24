Actin - severing protein cofilin and Golgi apparatus - localized Ca 2 + ATPase Pmr1 are involved in protein sorting at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) in yeast Curwin et al . ( Mol Biol Cell 23 : 2327 – 2338 , 2012 ) . To reduce PrA excretion into the beer fermentation broth , we regulated the Golgi apparatus sorting of PrA , thereby facilitating the delivery of more PrA to the vacuoles in the yeast cells . In the present study , the cofilin - coding gene COF1 and the Pmr1 - coding gene PMR1 were overexpressed in the parental strain W303 - 1A and designated as W + COF1 and W + PMR1 , respectively . The relative expression levels of COF1 in W + COF1 and PMR1 in W + PMR1 were 5 . 26 - and 19 . 76 - fold higher than those in the parental strain . After increases in the expression levels of cofilin and Pmr1 were confirmed , the PrA activities in the wort broth fermented with W + COF1 , W + PMR1 , and W303 - 1A were measured . Results showed that the extracellular PrA activities of W + COF1 and W + PMR1 were decreased by 9 . 24 % and 13 . 83 % , respectively , at the end of the main fermentation compared with that of W303 - 1A . Meanwhile , no apparent differences were found on the fermentation performance of recombinant and parental strains . The research uncovers an effective strategy for decreasing PrA excretion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Keywords Proteinase A ( PrA ) · Beer foam · COF1 · PMR1 · trans - Golgi network sorting Introduction Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteinase A ( PrA ) ( saccharopep - sin ; EC 3 . 4 . 23 . 25 ) is an aspartic proteinase located in the acidic vacuole [ 10 , 15 , 23 ] . As a proteolytic enzyme , PrA is necessary to the vacuolar proteolytic system of S . cerevisiae during different conditions , including vegetative growth and nutritional stress [ 29 , 33 ] . PrA - induced protein proteolysis provides amino acids for new protein synthesis under nutri - tional stress conditions [ 35 ] . For instance , PrA hydrolyzes sporulation - associated protein into amino acids for the syn - thesis of new spore proteins under nitrogen starvation [ 17 ] . PrA may indirectly regulate the direction and rate of glyco - lytic flux through controlling the expression of glycolytic enzymes , such as pyruvate kinase , hexokinase , and phospho - fructokinase [ 5 ] . In addition , S . cerevisiae PrA is involved in the activation process of other enzymes , including proteinase B , carboxypeptidase ( CPY ) , RNase , trehalase , alkaline phos - phatase , and aminopeptidase I [ 14 , 20 , 29 , 37 , 48 ] . Clearly , these diverse biological functions of PrA are vital for S . cer - evisiae cell growth . However , once released from the yeast cells under stress conditions , PrA exhibits certain negative roles , especially for beer foam stability [ 43 ] . Extracellular PrA hydrolyzes lipid transfer protein 1 ( an important foam - positive protein ) to indirectly decrease the stability of beer foam [ 16 , 43 , 46 ] . To improve beer foam stability , research - ers need to resolve PrA excretion in S . cerevisiae . Apart from fermentation process optimization [ 8 , 46 ] , construc - tion of low - PrA - activity strains with genetic engineering is an usual approach to improve the stability of beer foam . Lu et al . reported that the disruption of PEP4 ( PrA - encoding gene ) increases beer foam stability , whereas the disruption of more than two allele PEP4 genes has a negative effect on beer fermentation ; the remarkable phenomena are the pro - longation of growth lag phase and the decrease of wort sugar consumption [ 25 ] . Thus , to decrease the PrA excretion , we * Yefu Chen yfchen @ tust . edu . cn 1 Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology , Ministry of Education , Tianjin Industrial Microbiology Key Laboratory , College of Biotechnology , Tianjin University of Science and Technology , Tianjin 300457 , People’s Republic of China 602 Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology ( 2019 ) 46 : 601 – 612 1 3 should explore a new approach , instead of modifying the PrA - encoding gene . In eukaryotic cells , the transport of secretory proteins is mediated by a secretory pathway that is made of an elaborate endomembrane system , including a series of independent organelles [ 22 , 34 ] . These organelles function sequentially together with transport vesicles among these organelles to accurately send secretory proteins to the correct destina - tions [ 22 ] . After being synthesized on ribosomes , secre - tory proteins enter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) through a protein pore in the ER membrane [ 22 ] . The secretory proteins are delivered from the ER to the Golgi apparatus by COPII - coated vesicles [ 4 , 22 ] . Many sorting pathways exist with the Golgi apparatus , and proteins are sorted in the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) to ensure that they are either transported to additional compartments , including the vacuole / lysosome , or sent to the cell surface [ 22 , 30 ] . To date , two TGN sorting pathways , namely receptor - mediated sorting process and receptor - independent sorting process , are well characterized . In the late Golgi membranes of yeast , vacuolar hydrolases , such as PrA and CPY , bind their recep - tor Vps10p and are packed into clathrin - coated vesicles for exporting to the vacuole [ 7 , 45 ] . Mannose - 6 - phosphate - containing lysosomal hydrolases in higher eukaryotes are sorted to the endosomes / lysosomes through the recognition of the mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor ( M6PR ) , and Mrl1p ( a distant M6PR ortholog ) in yeast is also involved in the sort - ing of vacuolar hydrolases [ 2 , 45 ] . Chen et al . strengthened the sorting of PrA to the vacuole by increasing the expres - sion level of Vps10p to reduce the excretion of PrA , and the extracellular PrA activity in the VPS10 - overexpression strain was decreased by 41 . 49 % compared with that of the parental strain [ 6 ] . Clearly , the regulation of receptor - mediated sort - ing process at the TGN can affect the transport process of certain vacuolar proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the vacuole , changing the distribution of certain vacuolar pro - teins in vivo and in vitro . On the basis of these findings , the sorting activity of certain lysosomal ( vacuolar ) hydrolases at the TGN for delivery to lysosome ( vacuole ) is a sorting receptor - mediated process . Recently , a novel protein sorting pathway at the TGN different from the “classical receptor - mediated sorting process” was reported by Kienzle and von Blume [ 19 ] . The novel sorting pathway is not completely described in current works and is currently described as follows : In mammalian cells , once the actin - severing protein cofi - lin is activated , it binds to the secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 ( SPCA1 ) and recruits actin filaments to the TGN [ 18 , 39 ] . Subsequently , SPCA1 is activated and pumps Ca 2 + into a specific domain of the TGN [ 39 ] . Cab45 , a high - affinity Ca 2 + - binding protein , binds to the luminal Ca 2 + of local increase at the TGN , probably inducing a conformational change of Cab45 [ 19 , 40 ] . The Cab45 of conformational change can bind to secretory proteins , con - sequently segregating them from other proteins at the TGN [ 19 , 40 ] . The Cab45 - protein complex is then dissociated by a signal , such as phosphorylation or a decrease in Ca 2 + , resulting in the sorting of the segregating secretory pro - teins into a particular class of transport carriers [ 19 ] . The above - mentioned work reveals the involvement of several key components , including cofilin , SPCA1 , actin , Ca 2 + , and Cab45 , in the TGN sorting of secretory proteins in mammalian cells . However , one key issue is whether these components have a similar role in the protein sorting at TGN in yeast . Curwin et al . reported that cofilin and Pmr1 ( the yeast ortholog of SPCA1 ) play conserved roles in the sorting of secreted proteins at the TGN / late Golgi mem - branes in S . cerevisiae [ 9 ] . Yeast cells harboring cofilin mutant exhibit various phenotypes , including the retention of the cell wall protein Bgl2 in the late Golgi compart - ment and the excretion of CPY normally located in the vacuole [ 9 ] . Loss of Pmr1 shows similar sorting defects with cofilin - mutant cells , and Pmr1 provides the secretory pathway with the Ca 2 + required for the protein sorting at the TGN [ 1 , 9 , 11 , 31 , 39 , 41 ] . Clearly , the modification of the protein sorting at TGN in yeast can be a feasible method to regulate the secretion of proteins . In this current work , a new strategy was employed to reduce PrA excretion by regulating the sorting of PrA from the Golgi apparatus . Cofilin and Pmr1 have a conserved role in protein sorting at the TGN in yeast [ 19 ] . To prevent the release of PrA from cells , we regulated the TGN sort - ing of PrA by overexpressing cofilin and Pmr1 , thereby promoting preferential PrA transport to the vacuoles . PrA activity was examined and compared between the recom - binant strains and the parental strain to evaluate whether the new approach can effectively decrease PrA excretion . Materials and methods Strains and vectors The relevant characteristics of all strains and plasmids used in this study are presented in Table 1 . S . cerevisiae W303 - 1A and Escherichia coli DH5α were obtained from the Yeast Collection Center of the Tianjin Key Laboratory of Industrial Microbiology . The plasmids pUG6 , pUC19 , and YEp352 used in this study were purchased from Invit - rogen ( Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , of which pUC19 and YEp352 were used as the original vectors for the construction of recombinant plasmids . The plasmid pPGK1 was gener - ously provided by Prof . Bauer F ( Stellenbosch University , South Africa ) [ 44 ] . 603 Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology ( 2019 ) 46 : 601 – 612 1 3 Growth and cultivation conditions Escherichia coli DH5α was used as the cloning host to amplify the recombinant DNA and was cultured at 37 °C in Luria – Bertani ( LB ) medium ( 1 % NaCl , 1 % tryptone , and 0 . 5 % yeast extract ) supplemented with ampicillin ( 100 mg / L ) or kanamycin ( 100 mg / L ) . The yeast strains were cultured at 30 °C in yeast extract peptone dextrose ( YPD ) medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , and 2 % glucose ) . To select the geneticin ( G418 ) - resistant recombinant strains , we added 900 mg / L of G418 to the YPD plates . All the solid media used in the present work were added with 2 % agar ( Difco , USA ) . Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303 - 1A was employed as the parental strain in this study . The parental strain W303 - 1A and recombinant strains were cultured in 10°P wort broth for performing beer fermentation . The 10°P wort was prepared as follows : The malt – water mixture ( crushed malt : water ratio 1 : 4 , g / v ) was mashed for an hour at 65 °C and then filtered . After boiling for an hour , the filtered malt extracts were diluted with water and adjusted its apparent extract to 10°P , namely 10°P wort broth . Construction of recombinant plasmids and yeast transformants Yeast genomic DNA was obtained from the parental strain W303 - 1A using the yeast DNA kit ( D3370 - 01 , Omega , USA ) . The plasmids were isolated from E . coli DH5α using the Plasmid Mini Kit I ( D6943 - 02 * , Omega , USA ) . The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) primers used in the cur - rent study are listed in Table 2 . All primers were designed according to the sequence of S . cerevisiae S288c genome ( NCBI , http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / ) and synthesized by GENEWIZ ( Beijing , China ) . An upstream homologous DNA fragment of the COF1 gene was PCR - amplified using the W303 - 1A genomic DNA as the template with COF1A - U and COF1A - D prim - ers . A downstream homologous DNA fragment was simi - larly amplified using COF1B - U and COF1B - D primers . The amplified PCR products were digested by the appro - priate endonucleases and then inserted into the plasmid pUC19 at Eco RI and Kpn I sites , and Bam HI and Sph I sites , respectively , to construct the plasmid pUC - A COF1 B COF1 . After being PCR - amplified using the plasmid pUG6 as the template with Kan - U and Kan - D primers , the KanMX cas - sette was digested with the restriction enzymes Kpn I and Bam HI , and then cloned to pUC - A COF1 B COF1 to produce the final plasmid pUC - A COF1 KB COF1 . On the basis of the aforementioned strategy , the plasmid pUC - A PMR1 KB PMR1 was obtained by inserting the upstream homologous frag - ment of the PMR1 gene , KanMX cassette , and downstream homologous fragment of the PMR1 gene into the pUC19 cloning vector in turn . The deletion cassette of COF1A - loxP - KanMX - loxP - COF1B was PCR - amplified using the plasmid pUC - A COF1 K - B COF1 as the template and then transformed into the cells of the parental strain W303 - 1A using the lithium acetate / Table 1 Characteristics of strains and plasmids used in the current study Strains or plasmids Relevant characteristic Reference or source Strains E . coli DH5α SupE44 ∆ lacU169 ( φ80 lacZΔM15 ) hsdR17 recAl endAl gyrA96 thi - 1 relA Stratagene W303 - 1A MATa ade2 - 1 trp1 - 1 leu2 - 3 , 112 his3 - 11 , 15 ura3 - 1 can1 - 100 [ 42 ] W∆COF1 MATa ade2 - 1 trp1 - 1 leu2 - 3 , 112 his3 - 11 , 15 ura3 - 1 can1 - 100 , COF1 : : loxP - KanMX - loxP This work W∆PMR1 MATa ade2 - 1 trp1 - 1 leu2 - 3 , 112 his3 - 11 , 15 ura3 - 1 can1 - 100 , PMR1 : : loxP - KanMX - loxP This work W + COF1 MATa ade2 - 1 trp1 - 1 leu2 - 3 , 112 his3 - 11 , 15 ura3 - 1 can1 - 100 , COF1 : : loxP - KanMX - loxP - PGK1 P - COF1 - PGK1 T This work W + PMR1 MATa ade2 - 1 trp1 - 1 leu2 - 3 , 112 his3 - 11 , 15 ura3 - 1 can1 - 100 , PMR1 : : loxP - KanMX - loxP - PGK1 P - PMR1 - PGK1 T This work Plasmids pPGK1 Ap r , containing the PGK1 P - PGK1 T expression cassette [ 24 ] pUC19 Ap r , cloning vector Invitrogen pUG6 Kan r , containing loxP - KanMX - loxP cassette [ 13 ] pUC - A COF1 KB COF1 Ap r , Kan r , containing COF1A - loxP - KanMX - loxP - COF1B This work pUC - A PMR1 KB PMR1 Ap r , Kan r , containing PMR1A - loxP - KanMX - loxP - PMR1B This work YEp352 URA3 + , Ap r ori control vector Invitrogen YEp - PGK Ap r , Kan r , containing PGK1 P - PGK1 T This work YEp - PC Ap r , Kan r , containing PGK1 P - COF1 - PGK1 T This work YEp - PP Ap r , Kan r , containing PGK1 P - PMR1 - PGK1 T This work 604 Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology ( 2019 ) 46 : 601 – 612 1 3 Table 2 Primers used in the present study Primer Sequence ( 5 ′ → 3 ′ ) Restriction site For plasmid construction Kan - U CGG GGT ACC CAG CTG AAG CTT CGT ACG C Kpn I Kan - D CGC GGA TCC GCA TAG GCC ACT AGT GGA TCTG Bam HI COF1A - U CGGAA TTC ATC GGT CAC ACC TGT ATT CT Eco RI COF1A - D GGGGT ACC CTT GTT TCC TCT TTT TCT TC Kpn I COF1B - U CGGGA TCC TTT TCT CTT CGC AAC TCT AT Bam HI COF1B - D CAT GCA TGC CTT TTT TTT CAG TGT GTG GT Sph I PMR1A - U CGGAA TTC TTC ATC ATT TGC CCT TCT G Eco RI PMR1A - D GGGGT ACC AGT TTA ACG ATC GGC TTT G Kpn I PMR1B - U CGGGA TCC GGT CAA ATG TGC GCT ATA T Bam HI PMR1B - D CAT GCA TGC TAA ATG AGG AAG GAG AAG G Sph I PGK1 P - U CGC GGA TCC TCT AAC TGA TCT ATC CAA AA Bam HI PGK1 T - D ACGC GTC GAC TAA CGA ACG CAG AAT TTT CG Sal I COF1 - U GAA TTC CAG ATC TCCTC GAG ATG TCT AGA TCT G GGT ATG C Xho I COF1 - D TCT ATC GCA GAT CCCTC GAG TTA ATG AGA ACC AGC GCC TC Xho I PMR1 - U GAA TTC CAG ATC TCCTC GAG ATG AGT GACAA TCC ATT Xho I PMR1 - D TCT ATC GCA GAT CCCTC GAG TCA AAC ATTTG AGA AAT AC Xho I For recombinant construction COF1 + A - U GAT CAC CCA TAT TCT TTG TTA CTT – COF1 + A - D CCT GCA GCG TAC GAA GCT TCA GCT GCT TCT TTT GTT AGT TTT TTG TTT A – COF1 + B - U AAC TCG AAA ATT CTG CGT TCG TTA GGT AAA TGA TTT CAC AAA TGA CAA C – COF1 + B - D TGC TTA TCT ACT AAA AAC GTA GGC – Kan + COF1 - U TAA ACA AAA AAC TAA CAA AAG AAG CAG CTG AAG CTT CGT ACG CTG CAG G – Kan + COF1 - D CAG TTT TGG ATA GAT CAG TTA GAG CAT AGG CCA CTA GTG GAT CTG ATA T – PC - U ATA TCA GAT CCA CTA GTG GCC TAT GCT CTA ACT GAT CTA TCC AAA ACT G – PC - D GTT GTC ATT TGT GAA ATC ATT TAC CTA ACG AAC GCA GAA TTT TCG AGT T – PMR1 + A - U CTG CTT CAT CAT TTG CCC TTC TGT – PMR1 + A - D ACC TGC AGC GTA CGA AGC TTC AGC TGA ATT ATC TTA TCT TTT ACT TAC AC – PMR1 + B - U ATA ACT CGA AAA TTC TGC GTT CGT TAC GTT GGA CTG TCT CTG TTAG – PMR1 + B - D GGT GAA GCT TGG TCT CTT TG – Kan + PMR1 - U GTG TAA GTA AAA GAT AAG ATA ATT CAG CTG AAG CTT CGT ACG CTG CAG GT – Kan + PMR1 - D CAG TTT TGG ATA GAT CAG TTA GAG CAT AGG CCA CTA GTG GAT CTG ATA T – PP - U ATA TCA GAT CCA CTA GTG GCC TAT GCT CTA ACT GAT CTA TCC AAA ACT G – PP - D CTA ACA GAG ACA GTC CAA CGT AAC GAA CGC AGA ATT TTC GAG TTAT – For PCR verification A COF1 K - F AAC TTT TAC TGA TTT GGC – A COF1 K - R TTA TAT TAA GGG TTG TCG – KB COF1 - F AGA AAG TAA TAT CAT GCG TC – KB COF1 - R AAT AAT CTG GTC TGT AAG CG – A PMR1 K - F ATC GTT TAG TGC TGT GTT – A PMR1 K - R GAC TGT CAA GGA GGG TAT – KB PMR1 - F AAT CGT ATG TGA ATG CTG – KB PMR1 - R ATT GTT AAA TTG GGT GGT – A + COF1 K - F ACA AGA CGG TAA AATCG – A + COF1 K - R GAA GAA CCT CAG TGGCA – P T B COF1 - F TTC TCT TTC CCC ATCCT – P T B COF1 - R CAT TCT TTC CAA CCGTT – A + PMR1 K - F ATC GTT TAG TGC TGT GTT – A + PMR1 K - R TCA AGG AGG GTA TTC TGG – P T B PMR1 - F TCT TTT CTC TTT CCC CAT – 605 Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology ( 2019 ) 46 : 601 – 612 1 3 PEG procedure [ 12 ] . The COF1 - deletion strain was screened using the YPD plates supplemented with 900 mg / L of G418 . After selection , the transformants were PCR verified using the two pairs of primers , namely A COF1 K - F / A COF1 K - R , and KB COF1 - F / KB COF1 - R , resulting in the occurrence of the COF1 - deletion strain WΔCOF1 . The same strategy was demonstrated to obtain the PMR1 - deletion strain WΔPMR1 . The PGK1 P - PGK1 T expression cassette harboring the constitutive yeast phosphoglycerate kinase gene promoter PGK1 P , terminator PGK1 T , and three restriction enzymes was PCR - amplified using the pPGK1 plasmid DNA as the template with PGK1 P - U and PGK1 T - D primers . Afterward , it was inserted between the Bam HI and Sal I sites of plasmid YEp352 to generate the recombinant plasmid YEp - PGK . Next , the COF1 fragment amplified from W303 - 1A genomic DNA was cloned to the vector YEp - PGK by in - fusion [ 47 ] , resulting in the plasmid YEp - PC . The plasmid YEp - PP ( YEp - PGK1 P - PMR1 - PGK1 T ) with PMR1 under the control of the promoter PGK1 P and terminator PGK1 T was con - structed using the aforementioned strategy . DNA assembler [ 32 ] was used for the rapid construction of the COF1 - overexpression strain W + COF1 , as shown in Fig . 1 , to allow the integration of multiple DNA fragments on a yeast chromosome in a one - step fashion by exploit - ing the in vivo homologous recombination in S . cerevisiae . COF1 + A ( an upstream homologous DNA fragment of the COF1 gene ) and COF1 + B ( a downstream homologous DNA fragment of the COF1 gene ) were PCR - amplified using the W303 - 1A genomic DNA as the template . KanMX and PGK1 P - COF1 - PGK1 T fragment were PCR - amplified using the plasmids pUG6 and YEp - PC as the templates . The prim - ers Kan + COF1 - U and Kan + COF1 - D were used for amplifying KanMX fragment , and the primers PC - U and PC - D were used for amplifying PGK1 P - COF1 - PGK1 T fragment . As shown in Fig . 1 , the 3 ′ - end of the first fragment COF1 + A was designed to overlap with the 5 ′ - end of KanMX fragment ; KanMX and PGK1 P - COF1 - PGK1 T fragments were designed to overlap with the two flanking ones , and the 5 ′ - end of the last fragment COF1 + B overlapped with the 3 ′ - end of PGK1 P - COF1 - PGK1 T fragment .

The resulting PCR products were cotransformed into S . cerevisiae W303 - 1A through lithium acetate / PEG method , allowing them to be integrated onto the accurate site of the yeast chromosome . After being selected with the YPD plates supplemented with 900 mg / L of G418 , the transformants were PCR verified using the primers in Table 2 , resulting in the occurrence of the COF1 - overexpression strain W + COF1 . The same strat - egy was demonstrated to obtain the PMR1 - overexpression strain W + PMR1 . Real‑time quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted from yeast cell cultures during the exponential growth phase using the yeast RNA kit ( Omega , Madison , USA ) . cDNA was PCR synthesized using mRNA as the template , following the instructions of the reverse transcription system kit ( Takara , China ) . The mRNA lev - els of the corresponding gene were evaluated by real - time quantitative PCR ( RT - qPCR ) with the use of an Ultra SYBR Two - Step RT - qPCR kit with ROX ( reference dye for real - time PCR ) ( CWBIO , Beijing , China ) . The relative expres - sion level of mRNAs was calculated using the 2 −∆∆CT method . The E2 ubiquitin - conjugating protein gene ( UBC6 ) was used as the reference gene [ 36 ] . The specific primers for the amplification of target genes and the reference gene UBC6 are presented in Table 2 . The expression level of the target genes in the fermentation medium was normalized to that of UBC6 . PrA activity assay A modified version of the fluorescence method , which was reported by Hiroto Kondo and Hideko Yomo [ 21 ] , was used to assay PrA activity . A total of 1500 μL Mcllvaine buffer ( 0 . 2 M disodium hydrogen phosphate plus 0 . 1 M citric acid , pH 5 . 5 ) , 1370 μL distilled water , 12 μL fluorogenic substrate ( 0 . 5 mM ) , and 100 μL sample solution were added into the test tube . The mixture solution then reacted at 37 °C for 30 min . After 18 μL NaOH ( 0 . 5 mM ) was added to terminate the reaction , the PrA activity was measured by fluorospec - trophotometer ( excitation = 328 nm , emission = 393 nm , slit width = 1 . 5 ) . The fluorogenic substrate ( MOAc - Ala - Pro - Ala - Lys - Phe - Phe - Arg - Leu [ Dnp ] - NH 2 ) was synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd . ( Shanghai , China ) . Ninhydrin assay Assay samples were diluted 100 - fold with distilled water . The diluted assay samples ( 2 ml ) were mixed with freshly prepared ninhydrin reagent ( 1 ml ) . The reaction mixture was then heated in a water bath at 100 °C for 16 min . After being cooled in a 20 °C water bath for 20 min , the reaction mixture was terminated with potassium iodate solution ( 5 ml ) . Then , absorbance was measured at 570 nm by a spectrophotom - eter . Glycine standard solution ( α - amino nitrogen content of 2 mg / L ) and blanks were prepared using the aforementioned method . Fermentation experiments and fermentation performance analysis The yeast strains were cultured in 5 ml of 10°P wort and were shaken at 30 °C and 180 rpm for 12 h . A total of 5 ml of overnight cultures were then inoculated into 50 ml wort ( 10°P ) at 16 °C for 72 h stationary cultivation to adapt the yeasts to a low - temperature fermentation condition . After - ward , 15 ml precultured yeast was inoculated into 10°P wort ( 135 ml ) in the Erlenmeyer flask with fermentation bung . The density of the inoculum was approximately 2 × 10 −7 cells / ml . Fermentation was performed at 16 °C for approxi - mately 7 days . Extracellular PrA activity , biomass ( optical density [ OD ] = 600 nm ) production , sugar consumption , and α - amino nitrogen consumption of the yeast strains were measured on days 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 7 of fermenta - tion . Determination of biomass production and sugar con - sumption was performed using spectrophotometer and Brix hydrometer , respectively . The ninhydrin assay was used for detecting α - amino nitrogen content . As the fermentation ended , the content of residual reducing sugar was analyzed using Fehling’s reagent according to the Chinese National Standard GB / T 15038 - 2006 , and ethanol production was measured using the density bottle method ( 20 °C ) accord - ing to the Chinese National Standard GB / T 4928 - 2008 . At least three independent biological replicates and technical duplicates were assayed for all strains . Statistical analysis The data were expressed as mean ± SD . The differences of the recombinant strains compared with the parental strain were confirmed by Student’s t test . Differences at P < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Results Overexpression of the actin‑severing protein cofilin reduced PrA excretion In yeast , cofilin plays a conserved role in sorting secretory proteins at the TGN . The cofilin - mutant cells , which are 𝛼 - amino nitrogen content ( mg / L ) = 2 ( mg / L ) × dilution ratio of sample × the average absorbance of sample solution the average absorbance of glycine standard solution 607 Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology ( 2019 ) 46 : 601 – 612 1 3 defective in cofilin function , can delay the sorting of the vacuolar protein CPY from the TGN to vacuole and secrete CPY to the medium [ 9 ] . To examine whether cofilin defi - ciency influences the PrA excretion as CPY , we deleted the cofilin - encoding gene ( COF1 ) and measured the extracel - lular PrA activity of the COF1 - deletion strain WΔCOF1 and the parental strain W303 - 1A at different stages of fermenta - tion ( Fig . 2a ) . At the end of the main fermentation , the PrA activity of WΔCOF1 in the wort broth was 1 . 34 - fold higher than that of the parental strain W303 - 1A . As observed , loss of COF1 enhanced the PrA excretion . The increase in PrA excretion may be because cofilin loss influences the sort - ing of PrA from the TGN to the vacuole . To further verify the view , the intracellular PrA activities of WΔCOF1 and W303 - 1A were detected at the end of the main fermentation ( Fig . 2b ) . Figure 2b shows that the intracellular PrA activity of WΔCOF1 was decreased by 30 . 19 % compared with that of the W303 - 1A . Thus , cofilin deficiency may interfere the sorting of the vacuolar protein PrA at the TGN , resulting in that a part of PrA is not properly delivered to the vacu - ole and finally promoting the secretion of more PrA into the medium . This result is consistent with that of Okreglak and Drubin’s report in which the vacuolar protein CPY was excreted from the yeast cells if CPY could not be properly transported to the lumen of the vacuole in a cofilin - mutant strain [ 27 ] . Therefore , cofilin plays a vital role in sorting PrA at the TGN , and loss of COF1 can lead to an increase in the PrA excretion . On the basis of the aforementioned result , we raised the question of whether the overexpression of COF1 facilitates the sorting of PrA from the TGN to the vacuole , guiding in more PrA to be delivered to the correct destination ( vacuole ) in time and leading to the decrease of PrA excretion . To verify this point , we overexpressed COF1 and measured the mRNA level of COF1 in the COF1 - overexpression strain W + COF1 . The RT - qPCR result showed that the COF1 Fig . 2 PrA activity of the recombinant strains ( W∆COF1 and W + COF1 ) and the parental strain W303 - 1A . a The extracellular PrA activity of W∆COF1 and W303 - 1A during beer fermentation . b The intracellular PrA activity of W∆COF1 and W303 - 1A on the 7th day of fermentation . c The extracellular PrA activity of W + COF1 and W303 - 1A during beer fermentation . d The intracellular PrA activ - ity of W + COF1 and W303 - 1A on the 7th day of fermentation .

After an increase in the COF1 expression level of W + COF1 was confirmed , we performed beer fermenta - tion test for W + COF1 and W303 - 1A , and the extracellular PrA activity of W + COF1 and W303 - 1A was measured to verify whether the overexpression of COF1 decreased the PrA excretion . At the end of the main fermentation , the PrA activity in the wort broth fermented with W + COF1 was reduced by 9 . 24 % compared with W303 - 1A ( Fig . 2c ) . Obvi - ously , the overexpression of cofilin can decrease the PrA excretion . The decrease of PrA excretion may result from the idea that COF1 overexpression interferes the sorting of PrA at the TGN , strengthening the transport of PrA to vacuole and indirectly leading to the decrease of PrA excretion . To prove the speculation , we measured the intracellular PrA activity of W + COF1 and W303 - 1A ( Fig . 2d ) . The intracel - lular PrA activity of W + COF1 was 1 . 29 - fold higher than that of W303 - 1A at the end of the main fermentation . The results confirmed that our assumption is reasonable . There - fore , the COF1 overexpression can reduce PrA excretion by regulating the sorting of PrA at the TGN . Overexpression of Golgi apparatus‑localized Ca 2 + ATPase Pmr1 reduced PrA excretion In the yeast cells , Pmr1 functions downstream of cofilin in regulating the sorting of cofilin - dependent proteins at the TGN and affects the vacuolar protein sorting [ 9 ] . Theoretically , Pmr1 should be involved in the regulation of sorting the vacu - olar protein PrA at the TGN . To verify the view , PMR1 , which coded the Golgi apparatus - localized Ca 2 + ATPase Pmr1 , was deleted completely . Then , we performed the beer fermentation test for the PMR1 - deletion strain WΔPMR1 and the parental strain W303 - 1A and measured their intracellular PrA activity ( Fig . 3b ) . As shown in Fig . 3b , the intracellular PrA activity of WΔPMR1 was lowered by 26 . 74 % compared with that of Fig . 3 PrA activity of the recombinant strains ( W∆PMR1 and W + PMR1 ) and the parental strain W303 - 1A . a The extracellular PrA activity of W∆PMR1 and W303 - 1A during beer fermentation . b The intracellular PrA activity of W∆PMR1 and W303 - 1A on the 7th day of fermentation . c The extracellular PrA activity of W + PMR1 and W303 - 1A during beer fermentation . d The intracellular PrA activity of W + PMR1 and W303 - 1A on the 7th day of fermentation . Data are average of three independent experiments and error bars represent ± SD . Asterisks denotes a significant difference ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 3 ) between W + PMR1 and W303 - 1A 609 Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology ( 2019 ) 46 : 601 – 612 1 3 W303 - 1A . Thus , PMR1 loss may interfere with the sorting of PrA from the TGN to the vacuole , leading to a failure to locate a part of PrA in the vacuole . Bonangelino et al . reported that in Pmr1 - disruption strain , CPY was secreted from the yeast cells if the transport of CPY from the TGN to vacuole was blocked or delayed [ 3 ] . To examine whether loss of Pmr1 exhibited similar sorting defects for PrA , we measured the extracellular PrA activity of WΔPMR1 and W303 - 1A ( Fig . 3a ) . At the end of the main fermentation , the PrA activity of WΔPMR1 in the wort broth was 1 . 35 - fold higher than that of W303 - 1A . The result that the strain lacking the Golgi apparatus - localized Ca 2 + ATPase Pmr1 exhibited an increase in PrA excretion indicates that the interference of PrA sorting from the TGN to the vacu - ole can influence PrA excretion . The conclusion is consistent with that of the report of Bonangelino et al . Therefore , the Golgi apparatus - localized Ca 2 + ATPase Pmr1 is involved in regulating the sorting of PrA from the TGN to the vacuole and the modification of Pmr1 can influence the secretion of PrA . Loss of Pmr1 reduces the rate of CPY transport from the TGN to the vacuole , leading to the excretion of CPY [ 3 , 9 ] . Furthermore , we verified that loss of Pmr1 strengthens PrA excretion into the medium . Hence , the overexpression of PMR1 may reduce the excretion of PrA . To verify this speculation , we overexpressed PMR1 and measured the mRNA level of PMR1 in the PMR1 - overexpression strain W + PMR1 by RT - qPCR . The relative expression level of the gene PMR1 in the recombinant strain W + PMR1 was 19 . 76 - fold higher than that in the parental strain W303 - 1A . Thus , the expression level of the gene PMR1 was increased in the PMR1 - overexpression strain W + PMR1 . Then , we performed the beer fermentation test for W + PMR1 and W303 - 1A and measured the extracellular PrA activity of W + PMR1 and W303 - 1A ( Fig . 3c ) . As shown in Fig . 3c , the PrA activity secreted into the wort broth for the recombinant strain W + PMR1 was reduced by 13 . 83 % compared with that for the parental strain W303 - 1A . Clearly , an increase in the expression level of Pmr1 can reduce the PrA excretion . The reason for the decrease of PrA excretion may be that the overexpression of Pmr1 strengthens the sorting of PrA from the TGN to the vacuole , resulting in the delivery of more PrA to the vacuole . To prove this point , we measured the intracellular PrA activity of W + PMR1 and W303 - 1A ( Fig . 3d ) . The intracellular PrA activity of W + PMR1 was 1 . 21 - fold higher than that of W303 - 1A . Our deduction was found to be correct . Thus , Pmr1 overexpression is a feasible method to reduce PrA excretion . Fermentation characteristics of the engineered strains On the basis of the above results , the actin - severing protein cofilin and the Golgi apparatus - localized Ca 2 + ATPase Pmr1 were involved in PrA sorting from the TGN to the vacuole , and the increase of the expression levels of cofilin and Pmr1 can reduce the excretion of PrA in yeast . In addition , the excellent and stable fermentation performance is significant for beer fermentation . Thus , the question of whether the overexpression of cofilin and Pmr1 influenced the fermen - tation performance of the recombinant strains needed to be considered after confirming a decrease in PrA excretion in the recombinant strains . Then , we measured the fermenta - tion parameters , including biomass , wort apparent extract , and α - amino nitrogen , for the two recombinant strains and the parental strain to assess their fermentation performance . During the beer fermentation , the biomass production of W + COF1 , W + PMR1 , and W303 - 1A was measured by spectrophotometry , as shown in Fig . 4a . The results showed that the biomass production of the recombinant strains and the parental strain had negligible differences . Furthermore , wort sugar consumption and α - amino nitrogen consumption of W + COF1 , W + PMR1 , and W303 - 1A were determined . As shown in Fig . 4b and c , no apparent change was observed in wort sugar consumption and α - amino nitrogen consump - tion between the two recombinant strains and the parental strain . To further assess the fermentation performance of the recombinant strains , we analyzed the content of the relevant metabolites ( ethanol and residual sugar ) at the end of the main fermentation . Table 3 shows that the negligible differ - ences between the two recombinant strains and the paren - tal strain were observed in the ethanol production and the residual sugar content . Thus , the overexpression of cofilin and Pmr1 can reduce the excretion of PrA and had no effect on the fermentation performance of the recombinant strains . Taken together , these findings highlight that enhancing the expression levels of cofilin and Pmr1 is an effective method to reduce PrA excretion . Discussion Beer foam stability is an important aspect of the overall beer quality , and stable beer foam is necessary to satisfy the consumer’s beer taste expectation [ 38 ] . However , PrA digests foam - active protein during beer storage , resulting in the decrease of beer foam stability . In the present work , the actin - severing protein cofilin was overexpressed in the parental strain W303 - 1A . The extracellular PrA activity of the recombinant strain W + COF1 was decreased by 9 . 24 % compared with that of the parental strain W303 - 1A . Cofilin regulates protein sorting in the yeast Golgi apparatus , simi - lar to that in mammalian cells [ 9 , 19 ] . The increase in the cofilin expression level may strengthen the protein sorting at the TGN , thereby altering the normal sort level or sort rate of certain proteins from the Golgi apparatus . The cofilin - mutant cells delay the transport of CPY from the TGN to the vacuole , and CPY is secreted from the cofilin - mutant 610 Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology ( 2019 ) 46 : 601 – 612 1 3 cells [ 9 ] . PrA and CPY are two soluble vacuolar protein enzymes [ 28 ] transported into the vacuole in the same recep - tor - mediated pathway [ 7 , 26 , 44 ] . Thus , the overexpression of cofilin may accelerate PrA transport from the TGN to the vacuole , resulting in the delivery of more PrA into the vacu - ole before being secreted from the yeast cells ; consequently , the PrA excretion was indirectly reduced . This phenomenon may account for the fact that the overexpression of cofilin decreases PrA excretion . Pmr1 functions in a cofilin - dependent sorting mecha - nism at the TGN and affects vacuolar protein sorting [ 9 , 39 ] . We overexpressed Pmr1 in the parental strain W303 - 1A to reduce the excretion of PrA . The result revealed that the excreted PrA activity of the recombinant strain W + PMR1 was reduced by 13 . 83 % compared with that of the parental strain W303 - 1A . The loss of Pmr1 , as a cofilin - mutant cell , has similar sorting defects for CPY ; such defects include the decrease in the rate of CPY transport and the excretion of CPY [ 9 ] . Thus , the expression level of Pmr1 was elevated , possibly accelerating the PrA sorting from the TGN to the vacuole . This phenomenon may be part of the reason for which overexpressing Pmr1 can decrease PrA excretion . Ion pump Pmr1 supplies Ca 2 + to the yeast secretory pathway and the increase in luminal Ca 2 + at the TGN is required for the Fig . 4 Fermentation performance of the parental strain W303 - 1A and the recombinant strains ( W + COF1and W + PMR1 ) during beer fer - mentation . a Biomass in OD 600 of the three strains ; b the curve of sugar consumption of the three strains ; c the curve of the concentra - tion of α - amino nitrogen of the three strains Table 3 Ethanol production and Residual reducing sugars content of the recombinant strains and the parental strain The data shown in this table represent mean ± SD ( standard devia - tion ) Yeast strains Ethanol % ( v / v , 20 °C ) Residual reducing sugar ( g / L ) W303 - 1A 3 . 46 ± 0 . 06 20 . 25 ± 0 . 39 W + COF1 3 . 50 ± 0 . 02 19 . 25 ± 0 . 17 W + PMR1 3 . 56 ± 0 . 03 19 . 75 ± 0 . 28 611 Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology ( 2019 ) 46 : 601 – 612 1 3 protein sorting from the Golgi apparatus [ 9 , 19 , 34 ] . Thus , overexpressing Pmr1 pumped more Ca 2 + into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus , resulting in a transient increase in the luminal Ca 2 + of the Golgi apparatus and promoting the TGN sorting of PrA destined to the vacuole . Therefore , the modi - fication of the TGN sorting process of PrA can effectively decrease PrA excretion . However , the precise mechanism of the receptor - independent sorting of PrA at the TGN remains unclear . The cofilin / Pmr1 - dependent sorting process may be one of the many other TGN sorting activities in yeast and is responsible for the sorting of certain vacuolar proteins or proteins transported to the plasma membrane . Future stud - ies should focus on exploring other sorting mechanisms and identifying new components in the cofilin / Pmr1 - dependent sorting process at the TGN . These key components that are involved in the TGN sorting of proteins could act as targets to decrease the PrA excretion .
