How these arrays are formed and stabilized against cellular depolymerizing forces remains an open question . Villin and ﬁmbrin are the best characterized actin - ﬁlament bundling or cross - linking proteins in plants and each isencoded by a multigene family of ﬁve members in Arabidopsis thaliana . The related villins and gelsolins are conserved proteins that are constructed from a core of six homologous gelsolin domains . Gelsolin is a calcium - regulated actin ﬁlament severing , nucleating and barbed end capping factor . Villin has a seventh domain at its C terminus , the villin headpiece , which can bind to an actin ﬁlament , conferring the ability to crosslink or bundle actin ﬁlaments . Many , but not all , villins retain the ability to sever , nucleate , and cap ﬁlaments . Here we have identiﬁed a putative calcium - insensitive villin isoform through comparison of sequence alignments between human gelsolin and plant villins with x - ray crystallography data for vertebrate gelsolin . VILLIN1 ( VLN1 ) has the least well - conserved type 1 and type 2 calcium binding sites among the Arabidopsis VILLIN isoforms . Recombinant VLN1 binds to actin ﬁlaments with high afﬁnity ( K d ; 1 m M ) and generates bundled ﬁlament networks ; both properties are independent of the free Ca 2 þ concentration . Unlike human plasma gelsolin , VLN1 does not nucleate the assembly of ﬁlaments from monomer , does not block the polymerization of proﬁlin - actin onto barbed ends , and does not stimulate depolymerization or sever preexisting ﬁlaments .

INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton is a ubiquitous and dynamic scaffolding that is present in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and plays a central role in numerous physiological processes , including muscle contraction , cell motility , organelle movement , vesicle trafﬁcking , and cytoplasmic streaming . Understanding how the actin cytoskeleton is organized , how its dynamics are regulated , and how its structure and function respond to environmental cues are open questions in cell biology . In plant cells , actin ﬁlaments often form prominent higher - order structures , such as bundles and cables , which serve as tracks for cytoplasmic streaming and organelle movements . A classic example is the actin cables within green algal cells of Nitella and Chara , where up to 100 actin ﬁlaments of uniform polarity are packed into a single actin bundle ( Nagai and Rebhun , 1966 ) . In several examples from higher plants , such as the root hair cells of Hydrocharis and stamen hair cells of Tradescantia , actin - ﬁlament bundles are involved not only in cytoplasmic streaming but also in stabilizing the structure of transvacuolar strands and maintaining the overall cellular architecture ( Staiger et al . , 1994 ; Shimmen et al . , 1995 ; Valster et al . , 1997 ; Tominaga et al . , 2000 ) . It has also been inferred that actin bundles play an important role in nuclear positioning , keeping the nucleus at a ﬁxed distance from the growing root hair tip ( Ketelaar et al . , 2002 ) . The size , shape , location , and number of actin bundles changes during the development of Drosophila bristles , leading to a suggestion that the status of internal actin bundles relates to morphogenesis ( Tilney et al . , 2003 ) . Similarly , the presence of ﬁlament bundles at particular stages of plant cell growth ( Thimann et al . , 1992 ; Waller and Nick , 1997 ; Waller et al . , 2002 ) and their loss or reduction in mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana with defective trichomes ( Leetal . , 2003 ; El - Assaletal . , 2004 ) ormaize ( Zea mays ) mutants with deﬁcient root cell expansion ( Baluska et al . , 2001 ) hint at additional roles during cell elongation and cellular morphogenesis . Bundles of actin also converge upon the 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Speciﬁc families of actin binding proteins are thought to be responsible foractinbundle formation inthecell . However , rather little is known about the actin cross - linking and bundling proteins from plant cells when compared with nonplant cells ( McCurdy et al . , 2001 ; Wasteneys and Galway , 2003 ; Staiger and Hussey , 2004 ) . Villin , which was originally isolated from the core actin bundles of intestinal epithelial cell microvilli ( Bretscher and Weber , 1979 ; Matsudaira and Burgess , 1979 ) , is one of the main proteins responsible for actin bundle formation . Villin belongs to a superfamily of actin binding proteins called the villin / gelsolin family ( Friederich and Louvard , 1999 ; Yin , 1999 ) . These are constructed from 125 to 150 amino acid gelsolin - repeat domains . Villin and gelsolin contain six gelsolin repeats ( G1 – G6 ) , whereas severin , fragmin , and CapG contain three repeats ( G1 – G3 ) . Gelsolin has Ca 2 þ - stimulated ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) severing activity . Gelsolin also caps the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments and nucleates formation of new ﬁlaments . Villin / gelsolin homologs have not been found in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome . Recently , we isolated an actin binding pro - tein from poppy ( Papaver rhoeas ) pollen , PrABP80 ; biochemical and microscopic characterization conﬁrmed that it is gelsolin - like ( Huang et al . , 2004 ) . Examples of the three domain protein have also been isolated from Lilium davidii pollen ( Fan et al . , 2004 ) and Mimosa pudica ( Yamashiro et al . , 2001 ) , and the authors inferred that these fragmin - like proteins had severing activity . In addition to a gelsolin - like core domain , villins contain an additional C - terminal actin binding module called the villin headpiece . The headpiece allows each molecule of villin to contact two adjacent ﬁlaments and to cross - link ﬁlaments into bundles , a property that is missing from gelsolins . In the presence of micromolar Ca 2 þ , most , but not all , villins sever actin ﬁlaments and cap ﬁlament barbed ends ( Glenney et al . , 1980 ; Northrop et al . , 1986 ; Janmey and Matsudaira , 1988 ) . Knockout mice with a null allele for villin have normal intestinal microvilli , but are defective in Ca 2 þ - stimulated fragmentation and destruction of the brush borders , leading to the conclusion that villin is essential for cytoskeletal reorganization in response to stimuli ( Ferrary et al . , 1999 ) . By contrast , Drosophila mutations in the Quail gene lead to female sterility and have defects in actin bundle formation during oogenesis ( Mahajan - Miklos and Cooley , 1994 ; Matova et al . , 1999 ) . Although the core gelsolin - homology domains of Quail are highly conserved , the recombinant protein does not sever , cap , or nucleate actin ﬁlaments in vitro ( Matova et al . , 1999 ) . This result emphasizes the need to make direct measurements of the actin binding properties for each villin family member before assuming its function in vivo . Two actin - bundling proteins from lily ( Lilium longiﬂorum ) pollen tubes , 135 - ABP and 115 - ABP , were isolated by biochemical fractionation ( Yokota et al . , 1998 ) , and sequence analyses reveal that both are plant villins ( Vidali et al . , 1999 ; Yokota et al . , 2003 ) . Although lily villin isoforms bundle actin ﬁlaments in a Ca 2 þ / calmodulin de - pendent manner , they do not have obvious severing or capping activity ( Nakayasu et al . , 1998 ; Yokota and Shimmen , 1999 ; Yokota et al . , 2000 ) . The Arabidopsis genome contains se - quences for ﬁve villin - like genes ( VLN1 (cid:1) 5 ; Klahre et al . , 2000 ; Staiger and Hussey , 2004 ) and GFP – villin fusions associate with actin ﬁlaments in vivo ( Klahre et al . , 2000 ) . However , there is no genetic or biochemical evidence for the function of AtVLNs . Various actin binding proteins perform in harmony to generate particular F - actin structures ; for example , cloud - like networks of dendritically - nucleated actin ﬁlaments formed on Arp2 / 3 - coated beads in vitro are converted into ﬁlopodia - like bundles in the absence of capping protein ( Vignjevic et al . , 2003 ) . The side binding protein tropomyosin inhibits Arp2 / 3 - induced actin ﬁla - ment branching , resulting in long and infrequently branched actin ﬁlaments as opposed to the dendritic network formed by Arp2 / 3 alone ( Blanchoin et al . , 2001 ) . Tropomyosin - decorated actin ﬁlaments are also protected from pointed end depolymerization and / or severing activity of ADF / coﬁlin ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ; Broschat et al . , 1989 ) . Genetic experiments show that mutations in proﬁlin suppress the bristle morphology pheno - types of capping protein ( CP ) mutants ( Hopmann and Miller , 2003 ) . Forplantactin bindingproteins , thereissome biochemical data to show cooperativity , but virtually no genetic evidence . For example , Arabidopsis FIMBRIN1 ( FIM1 ) stabilizes actin ﬁlaments against proﬁlin - mediated depolymerization in vitro and in vivo ( Kovar et al . , 2000b ) . And both Arabidopsis CP ( Huang et al . , 2003 ) and poppy gelsolin ( PrABP80 ; Huang et al . , 2004 ) can prevent addition of the proﬁlin – actin complex onto ﬁlament barbed ends . In this work , we show that VLN1 - decorated actin ﬁlaments are protected from ADF activity in vitro , providing further evidence that actin binding protein activities and levels must be carefully orchestrated to generate and maintain partic - ular actin structures in the plant cell . Based on sequence similarity and conserved domain organi - zation between villins from different kingdoms ( e . g . , 26 % identity and 36 % similarity between VLN1 and human villin ) , the plant villins have been assumed to maintain the full range of villin / gelsolin functions ( Holdaway - Clarke and Hepler , 2003 ) . We examined the properties of recombinant VLN1 by sedimentation , ﬂuorescence light microscopy , and kinetic polymerization as - says . We found that VLN1 binds with high afﬁnity to F - actin and bundles actin ﬁlaments in a calcium - and calmodulin - insensitive manner . However , recombinant VLN1 does not sever , cap , and nucleate actin ﬁlament formation in vitro . This can be explained by the poor conservation of predicted type 1 and type 2 calcium binding sites in the gelsolin - like core of VLN1 . During kinetic assays with ADF1 , VLN1 appears to bind ﬁrst and protects actin ﬁlaments from ADF - mediated depolymerization . Our ﬁndings support the conclusion that VLN1 efﬁciently promotes actin bundle formation and stabilizes it from actin depolymerizing factors . RESULTS Identiﬁcation of a Calcium - Insensitive Villin Isoform The Ca 2 þ - dependent activity of villin is contained in a core region , composed of six repeats , which displays strong homol - ogy to gelsolin ( Glenney et al . , 1981 ; Arpin et al . , 1988 ; Bazari Arabidopsis VILLIN1 487 et al . , 1988 ) . The x - ray crystal structures of Ca 2 þ - free gelsolin and of the N - and C - terminal halves of gelsolin bound to actin have brought insight into the mechanism of Ca 2 þ activation of gelsolin ( Burtnick et al . , 1997 , 2004 ; Robinson et al . , 1999 ; Choe et al . , 2002 ) . The eight Ca 2 þ binding sites contained within gelsolin were predicted , through sequence homology , to also exist in human villin ( Choe et al . , 2002 ) . Many of these sites have now been conﬁrmed through mutagenesis studies ( Kumar and Khurana , 2004 ; Kumar et al . , 2004 ) . We sought to determine whether these Ca 2 þ binding sites also exist in plant villins by aligning gelsolin , human villin , and plant villins based on the structural features determined for gelsolin , as shown in Figure 1 . The alignment shows that all plant villins contain the 4 amino acid signature of a gelsolin domain in 5 out of 6 of their gelsolin - homology domains ( G1 – G6 ; pink highlighting , Figure 1 ) with the exception , in each case , being domain G2 ( Choe et al . , 2002 ) . Comparison of the residues that are involved in the tail latch , a structural feature that locks gelsolin in its inactive state , suggests that this feature will also be present in plant and human villins ( red letters , Figure 1 ; Burtnick et al . , 1997 ) . Hence , the structures of inactive gelsolin and plant villins are likely to be similar . The villin tail latch precedes the headpiece domain , which in plants is separated by a variable length linker region ( Vidali et al . , 1999 ; Klahre et al . , 2000 ) . Comparison of the activated states of gelsolin and villins , judged by the conserva - tion of residues that form the characteristic active interfaces between G2 : G3 and G5 : G6 ( dark and light blue highlighting , respectively , Figure 1 ) , suggests that plant villins may also be able to reach a similar ﬁnal activated state to gelsolin . Further - more , a general conservation of actin binding residues in plant villins indicates that the molecules will share many of the actin binding surfaces that have been determined for gelsolin ( red highlighting , Figure 1 ) . Two classes of Ca 2 þ binding site have been identiﬁed : type 1 sites , where Ca 2 þ is bound at the interface between gelsolin and actin , mediating this interaction ; and type 2 sites , where Ca 2 þ is bound exclusively by gelsolin and is responsible for activation ( Choe et al . , 2002 ) . We compared the sequences of the plant villins with human gelsolin looking for differences in type 1 and type 2 sites ( Figure 1 ) . Type 1 Ca 2 þ binding sites ( green highlighting , Figure 1 ) are present in G1 and absent from G4 in all the aligned plant villins . Furthermore , each G2 domain has a basic residue at its type 1 site , which has been proposed to mimic the calcium interaction ( Choe et al . , 2002 ) . Type 2 sites ( yellow highlighting , Figure 1 ) are present in each of the six gelsolin domains and in the six gelsolin - like domains of human villin . Arabidopsis VLN1 has the fewest type 2 sites , with only one site in G2 and a probable second site in G4 , in which residue Glu475 is replaced by Asp . All other villins haveat least three type 2 calcium binding sites . VLN2 and VLN3 and 135 - ABP from lily pollen have the most , with four type 2 Ca 2 þ - sites in G1 , G2 , G4 , and G6 . All plant villins in this study have at least one domain where a basic residue replaces one of the acidic residues in the type 2 binding site , suggesting that these domains may achieveanactiveconformation andarenot regulatedbycalcium . In summary , VLN1 has the fewest potential calcium binding sites , and hence is a strong candidate to be a Ca 2 þ - insensitive villin . Puriﬁcation of Recombinant VLN1 To analyze the functional properties of VLN1 , the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as a nonfusion con - struct from a T7 vector . A bacterial extract ( Figure 2A , lane 1 ) was fractionated with ammonium sulfate precipitation ( Figure 2A , lane 2 ) , followed by chromatography on DEAE - Sephacel ( Fig - ure 2A , lane 3 ) , Cibacron Blue 3G - A ( Figure 2 , lane 4 ) , and Q - Sepharose ( Figure 2A , lane5 ) . Afterelutionfrom Q - Sepharose , the purity of VLN1 was > 90 % and typical yields were 5 mg from 1 liter of bacterial culture . The puriﬁed , recombinant protein cross - reacts with an afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibody raised against the G1 to G3 domains of VLN1 ( Figure 2B ) . VLN1 Binds to F - Actin in a Calcium - Independent Manner The ability of bacterially - expressed VLN1 to bind to F - actin was assayed with a high - speed cosedimentation assay , as shown in Figure 3 . A majority of the polymerized actin ( F - actin ) sedimented at 200 , 000 g ( Figure 3A , lane 3 ) . In the absence of F - actin , very little VLN1 or FIM1 , a well - characterized , plant actin crosslink - ing protein ( Kovar et al . , 2000b ) , was sedimented ( Figure 3A , lanes 9 and 15 ) . However , a signiﬁcant amount of VLN1 and FIM1 cosedimented in the presence of polymerized actin ( Figure 3A , lanes 6 and 12 ) . These results veriﬁed that VLN1 binds to F - actin . To determine the afﬁnity of VLN1 for binding to F - actin , increasing concentrations of VLN1 were incubated with pre - assembled F - actin as described previously for FIM1 ( Kovar et al . , 2000b ) . After sedimentation at 200 , 000 g , the amount of bound and free VLN1 was quantiﬁed by densitometry . Figure 3B shows a representative experiment in which the concentration of bound VLN1 was plotted against the concentration of free VLN1 . Similar results were obtained for FIM1 ( Figure 3C ) . By ﬁtting the representative experimental data with a hyperbolic function , K d values of 0 . 99 m M for VLN1 and 0 . 67 m M for FIM1 were obtained . From three such experiments , mean K d values ( 6 SD ) of 1 . 11 6 0 . 27 m M ( n ¼ 3 ) for VLN1 and 0 . 56 6 0 . 21 m M ( n ¼ 3 ) for FIM1 binding to F - actin were calculated . The latter result is consistent with the previously published value of 0 . 53 6 0 . 18 m M for FIM1 ( Kovar et al . , 2000b ) . At saturation , the stoichiometry of VLN1 : actin was 1 : 2 . 4 . To test for the ability of VLN1 to interact with plant actin ﬁlaments , identical experiments were performed with maize pollen actin ( Ren et al . , 1997 ) . Apparent K d values ( 6 SD ; n ¼ 3 ) of 0 . 79 6 0 . 19 m Mand 0 . 97 6 0 . 11 m Mwere determined for VLN1 binding to plant actin and rabbit actin , respectively . The binding was not statistically different ( by paired t test ) for interaction with two different sources of actin . For convenience , all subsequent experiments were performed with muscle actin . We also tested whether the binding of VLN1 to F - actin was affected by Ca 2 þ . As shown in Figure 3D , 3 m M actin and 1 m M VLN1 were incubated under polymerizing conditions in the presence of 4 . 6 nM , 100 nM , 1 . 0 m M , 12 m M , or 1 . 0 mM free Ca 2 þ . The amount of VLN1 that cosedimented with F - actin was not appreciably different at any of these Ca 2 þ concentrations . The results conﬁrmed that VLN1 binds to F - actin in a Ca 2 þ - insensitive manner . 488 The Plant Cell Figure 1 . Ca 2 þ Binding Sites Are Poorly Conserved in VLN1 . VLN1 Bundles F - Actin in a Calcium - Insensitive Manner The ability of VLN1 to bundle F - actin was examined with a low - speed cosedimentation assay . As shown in Figure 4 , very little polymerized actin sedimented at 13 , 500 g in the absence of actin binding protein ( Figure 4A , lane 3 ) . However , in the presence of VLN1 , more polymerized actin sedimented ( Figure 4A , lane 6 ) , and the amount of the actin in the pellet increased in proportion to VLN1 concentration ( data not shown ) . Although the binding of VLN1 to actin ﬁlaments was not sensitive to Ca 2 þ , it was still of interest to determine whether the bundling activity was Ca 2 þ - dependent . We tested this by assaying the amount of bundled actin at different concentrations of Ca 2 þ ( Figure 4B ) . Bundled actin was expressed as the amount of actin in the pellet determined by densitometry . When 3 m M actinand1 m MVLN1werepolymerizedinthepresenceof4 . 6nM , 100 nM , 1 . 0 m M , 12 m M , or 1 . 0 mM free Ca 2 þ , the percentage of actin in the pellet was 56 . 5 , 60 , 59 . 1 , 55 . 9 , and 63 . 9 % , respectively . These results indicated that VLN1 bundles actin ﬁlaments in a Ca 2 þ - insensitive manner . Lily pollen villins are regulated by Ca 2 þ - calmodulin ( Ca / CaM ) . Speciﬁcally , the bundling activity of 135 - ABP and 115 - ABP is inhibited in the presence of 500 m M Ca 2 þ and 7 m M bovine CaM ( Yokota et al . , 2000 , 2003 ) . To test whether VLN1 might also be regulated in this fashion , we performed low speed sedimentation assays under conditions where 3 m M actin ﬁlaments and 200 nM VLN1 were allowed to interact in the presence of 500 m M free Ca 2 þ and varying amounts of CaM . As shown in Figure 4C ( black bars ) , there was no difference in the amount of sedimentable actin ﬁlaments over two orders of magnitude ( 100 nM – 10 m M ) for [ CaM ] . Moreover , there was no detectable difference in the amount of VLN1 in the pellets ( Figure 4C , gray bars ) . Similar results were obtained in the presence of 10 m M free Ca 2 þ ( data not shown ) . These results demonstrate that VLN1 bundling activity was not inhibited by Ca / CaM . A kinetic light scattering assay was used to monitor the dynamic process of VLN1 induced F - actin bundle formation . As shown in Figure 5A , light scattering was measured during the polymerization of 4 - m M actin monomers ( Figure 5A , dashed line ) or after addition of varying amounts VLN1 ( Figure 5A , closed symbols ) . The light scattering increased rapidly and almost reached steady state within 200 s , indicating that VLN1 binds to actin ﬁlaments quickly as they polymerize . When VLN1 concentration was raised from 0 . 2 to 0 . 5 m M , the ﬁnal value of light scattering also increased , suggesting that more actin bundles were formed . One micromolar VLN1 was almost iden - tical to 0 . 5 m M VLN1 ( data not shown ) , suggesting that 0 . 5 m M VLN1 is sufﬁcient to saturate the bundling sites of 4 m M F - actin . To conﬁrm that the increase of light scattering during actin polymerization is mostly due to bundling and that villin has little effect on actin polymerization , we compared the variation of pyrene and light scattering during actin polymerization in the presence of 0 . 5 m M VLN1 ( Figure 5B ) . Whereas VLN1 induced a large increase in light scattering during actin polymerization , it had little effect on the kinetics of polymerization as measured by pyrene ﬂuorescence ( Figure 5B , open squares ¼ actin alone ; open circles ¼ actin and VLN1 ) . Figure 1 . ( continued ) . A sequence alignment of plant villins based on the structural features determined for gelsolin . The six gelsolin domains are aligned against each other and labeled G1 to G6 . These domains are ordered so that the most similar domains are paired ( G1 : G4 , G2 : G5 , and G3 : G6 ; Choe et al . , 2002 ) . GTAIL denotes the C - terminal extension , the tail latch . The boxed residues , labeled ‘‘Structurally Variable Region , ’’ do not show general structural homology between the six domains of gelsolin . Horizontal bars above the sequence show secondary structure and are labeled by letter according to the convention in Burtnick et al . ( 1997 ) . Orange and red bars signify a - helices in the active and inactive states , respectively ; similarly , light and dark blue bars represent b - strands in the active and inactive states ( Burtnick et al . , 1997 , 2004 ; Choe et al . , 2002 ) . Human villin ( hV ; accession no . NP _ 009058 ) , the ﬁve Arabidopsis villins ( VLN1 – 5 ; NP _ 029567 , NP _ 565958 , NP _ 567048 , AAO64915 , NP _ 200542 ) , and 135 - ABP ( AAD54660 ) are aligned against the gelsolin domains . Structural homology is represented as follows : the gelsolin domain signature residues are highlighted in pink ; residues that form the active state , domain - domain interactions between G2 : G3 , G5 : G6 , and G4 : G6 are colored dark blue , light blue , and gray , respectively ; tail - latch residues that interact with G2 , in the inactive conformation , are shown in red type ; residues that interact with actin are depicted with red highlighting ; type 1 and type 2 calcium ion coordinating residues are shown with green and yellow highlighting , respectively . Red Xs denote residues implicated in Ca 2 þ regulation by mutagenesis of vertebrate villin ( Kumar et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 2 . Puriﬁcation of Recombinant VLN1 .

When 4 m M actin was polymerized in the presence of an equimolar amount of rhodamine - phalloidin and diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 nM before attaching to polylysine - coated cover slips , only individual actin ﬁlaments were detected in the ﬁeld ( Figure 5C ) . By contrast , when actin was polymerized in thepresence of0 . 5 m MVLN1 ( Figure 5D ) long actin ﬁlament bundles were detected . If we increased the concentration of VLN1 , more higher - order actin bundles formed and the number of individual actin ﬁlaments decreased ( data not shown ) . VLN1 Does Not Nucleate , Cap , or Sever Actin Filaments Vertebrate villin and gelsolin have nucleation , barbed end cap - ping , and severing activities under certain calcium conditions ( Friederich et al . , 1999 ) . However , plant villins ( e . g . , 135 - ABP or 115 - ABP from lily ) have not been shown to have any of these activities ( Yokota and Shimmen , 1999 , 2000 ; Yokota et al . , 2003 ) perhapsbecauseofthelimited numbersofwaysthatinteractions withF - actinhavebeentested . Wethereforetestedthispossibility by nucleation , elongation , and depolymerization assays pre - viously established for the analysis of Arabidopsis AtCP ( Huang et al . , 2003 ) and poppy gelsolin ( PrABP80 ; Huang et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 3 . VLN1 Binds to F - Actin in a Calcium - Independent Manner . ( A ) A high - speed cosedimentation assay was used to determine VLN1 binding to F - actin . A mixture of 3 m M F - actin and 1 m M VLN1 , or 3 m M F - actin and 1 m M FIM1 , was centrifuged at 200 , 000 g for 1 h . The resulting supernatants and pellets were subjected to SDS - PAGE and Coomassie - stained . The position of actin , VLN1 , and FIM1 are marked at the right . The samples include : lane 1 , actin alone total ; lane 2 , actin alone supernatant ; lane 3 , actin alone pellet ; lane 4 , actin plus VLN1 total ; lane 5 , actin plus VLN1 supernatant ; lane 6 , actin plus VLN1 pellet ; lane 7 , VLN1 alone total ; lane 8 , VLN1 alone supernatant ; lane 9 , VLN1 alone pellet ; lane 10 , actin plus FIM1 total ; lane 11 , actin plus FIM1 supernatant ; lane 12 , actin plus FIM1 pellet ; lane 13 , FIM1 alone total ; lane 14 , FIM1 alone supernatant ; lane 15 , FIM1 alone pellet . ( B ) Increasing concentrations of VLN1 ( 0 . 3 – 3 . 4 m M ) were cosedimented with 3 m M F - actin . The concentration of bound VLN1 was plotted against the concentration of free VLN1 and ﬁtted with a hyperbolic function . For this representative experiment , the calculated dissociation constant ( K d ) was 0 . 99 m M . ( C ) Identical experiments to that shown in ( B ) were performed with FIM1 . For this representative experiment , the K d value was 0 . 67 m M . ( D ) Experiments similar to those described for ( A ) were repeated ( n ¼ 3 ) and extended to include different free [ Ca 2 þ ] . The resulting gels were scanned to determine the amount of VLN1 that was present in the pellet fraction under each condition . The percentage of VLN1 that cosedimented with F - actin at 4 . 6 nM Ca 2 þ was 65 . 0 ; at 100 nM Ca 2 þ was 67 . 4 ; at 1 m M Ca 2 þ was 69 . 9 , at 12 m M Ca 2 þ was 66 . 1 ; and at 1 mM Ca 2 þ was 64 . 2 . Arabidopsis VILLIN1 491 Experiments to examine the effect of VLN1 on the dynamics of actin polymerization from monomers were performed . As shown in Figure 6A , when pyrene ﬂuorescence was used to monitor rabbit muscle actin polymerization kinetically , the initial lag corresponding to the nucleation step decreased with increas - ing human plasma gelsolin ( GS ) concentration . However , in the presence of various concentrations of VLN1 , the initial actin polymerization rate did not change compared with actin alone ( Figure 6A ) . These results indicate that VLN1 does not have nucleation activity . Seeded elongation assays were performed to address whether VLN1 has capping activity . The elongation rate depends on the availability of actin ﬁlament barbed ends , under these experimental conditions : 0 . 4 m M preformed F - actin was incu - bated with varying concentrations of VLN1 or GS for 5 min and polymerization initiated with addition of 1 m M G - actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) at a free [ Ca 2 þ ] of 1 m M . The G - actin was saturated with 4 m M human proﬁlin to prevent spontaneous nucleation and elongation from pointed ends ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ) . The results showed that theinitial elongation rate was decreasedwith various amounts of GS ( Figure 6B ) . However , no change of initial elongation rate was observed in the presence of different concentrations of VLN1 . These results indicate that VLN1 does not have barbed - end capping activity . The inﬂuence of VLN1 and GS on actin ﬁlament depolymer - ization was investigated by adding equimolar amounts of proﬁlin ( 2 . 5 m M ) to pyrene - labeled F - actin and monitoring the decrease in ﬂuorescence . The results from a typical experiment in the presence of 10 m M free Ca 2 þ are shown in Figure 6C . The depolymerization rate was increased by adding various amounts of GS , compared with actin alone . By comparison , VLN1 did not increase the depolymerization rate , indicating that VLN1 does not have severing activity . VLN1 Stabilizes Actin Filaments and Protects Them from ADF - Mediated Depolymerization Microinjection of antiserum against 135 - ABP into living root hair cells induced the disappearance of transvacuolar strands ( Tominaga et al . , 2000 ; Ketelaar et al . , 2002 ) , suggesting that plant villin stabilized actin ﬁlaments in vivo and protected them from depolymerization . Plant ADF has been shown to be a potent depolymerizing factor in vitro ( Lopez et al . , 1996 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Maciver and Hussey , 2002 ) . To test whether VLN1 can stabilize actin ﬁlaments against ADF - induced depolymerization , pyrene - labeled actin ﬁlaments were incubated with VLN1 before addition of ADF1 and latrunculin B . In these experiments , latrunculin is used to synergize with ADF during actin depoly - merization by preventing readdition of actin subunits to ﬁlament barbed ends . The rapid decrease in ﬂuorescence after addition of ADF1 and latrunculin B to pyrene labeled actin ﬁlaments is mainly due to binding of ADF1 to actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 7A , open triangles ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ) , whereas the slow decrease in pyrene ﬂuorescence is due to actin ﬁlament depolymerization ( Figure 7A , open triangles ) . Addition of ADF1 to pyrene - labeled - actin ﬁlaments preincubated with VLN1 induced only a small change in pyrene ﬂuorescence ( Figure 7A , open diamonds ) , suggesting that actin ﬁlaments incubated with VLN1 before addition of ADF1 are protected against binding and subsequent depolymerization induced by ADF1 . Figure 4 . VLN1 Bundles F - Actin in a Calcium - and Calmodulin - Independent Manner . ( A ) A low - speed cosedimentation assay was used to determine the bundling activity of VLN1 . Actin alone ( 3 m M ) and actin plus 1 m M VLN1 were incubated under polymerization conditions and the reactions were centrifuged at 13 , 500 g . Equivalent amounts of total , supernatant , and pellet were separated by SDS - PAGE . Samples are : lane 1 , actin alone total ; lane 2 , actin alone supernatant ; lane 3 , actin alone pellet ; lane 4 , actin plus VLN1 total ; lane 5 , actin plus VLN1 supernatant ; and lane 6 , actin plus VLN1 pellet . ( B ) To determine whether calcium affects bundling activity , the experiments described in ( A ) were repeated ( n ¼ 3 ) in the presence of varying free Ca 2 þ concentrations . The resulting gels were scanned to determine the amount of actin in the pellet at different free [ Ca 2 þ ] . The percentage of actin sedimenting at 4 . 6 nM Ca 2 þ was 56 . 5 % ; at 100 nM Ca 2 þ was 60 % ; at 1 m M Ca 2 þ was 59 . 1 ; at 12 m M Ca 2 þ was 55 . 90 ; and at 1 mM Ca 2 þ was 63 . 9 % . ( C ) To test the effects of calmodulin , 3 m M actin and 200 nM VLN1 were incubated in the presence of 500 m M free [ Ca 2 þ ] and various amounts of calmodulin . The resulting gels were scanned to determine the percentage of actin ( black bars ) and VLN1 ( gray bars ) that sedimented under each condition . 492 The Plant Cell Figure 5 .

Arabidopsis VILLIN1 493 A spontaneous polymerization assay established that VLN1 protects elongated actin ﬁlaments against ADF ( Figure 7B ) . After a lag corresponding to the nucleation step , ADF1 increased the rate of polymerization by generating a higher concentration of ﬁlament barbed ends ( Figure 7B , closed squares ) than the control without ADF1 ( Figure 7B , dashed line ) . Addition of VLN1 in the polymerization mixture inhibited the effect of ADF ( Figure 7B , open squares ) . These results suggested that VLN1 binds rapidly to elongated actin ﬁlaments and prevents further binding of ADF to actin ﬁlaments . Fluorescence light microscopy was used to visualize the effect of both ADF1 and VLN1 on actin ﬁlaments , as shown in Figure 8 . Actin ﬁlaments polymerized in the presence of 3 m M ADF1 had a much shorter mean length ( Figure 8C ; 2 . 5 m m ) than actin alone ( Figure 8A ; 12 m m ) . By contrast , when actin was polymerized in the presence of 0 . 5 m M VLN1 ( Figure 8B ) long actin ﬁlament bundles were detected . In the presence of both VLN1 and ADF1 similar long actin ﬁlaments bundles were observed ( Figure 8D ) , suggesting that bundles generated byVLN1are resistant toADF - induced severing and depolymerization . DISCUSSION Here , we describe the biochemical characterization of VLN1 and its possible implication in actin cable formation and stabilization . The Arabidopsis VILLIN family ( AtVLN ) contains ﬁve isoforms encoded by VLN1 (cid:1) 5 . Each predicted AtVLN protein is com - posed of a core with six gelsolin homology domains followed by the C - terminal villin headpiece . Recombinant VLN1 binds to actin ﬁlaments andgenerates bundles invitro . Surprisingly , VLN1 did not nucleate , cap , or sever actin ﬁlaments . VLN1 is the ﬁrst villin / gelsolin family member from the plant kingdom that is not Ca 2 þ regulated , nor is its activity modulated by CaM like several other plant villins . During actin polymerization , bundles of actin ﬁlaments are generated rapidly by VLN1 and are resistant to depolymerization induced by ADF1 , suggesting a potential mechanism for actin cable formation and stabilization in vivo . Neither the afﬁnity for binding to actin ﬁlaments nor the bundling efﬁciency are affected by the source of actin ( i . e . , maize pollen or rabbit skeletal muscle ) . Cosedimentation assays provide additional insight about the binding of VLN1 to actin ﬁlaments and the bundling activity of VLN1 . VLN1 binds actin ﬁlaments with an apparent K d of 1 m M . The recombinant V2 – V3 and headpiece domains from chicken villin have reported K d values of 0 . 3 and 7 m M , respectively ( Pope et al . , 1994 ) . Drosophilia Quail , a villin - related protein , binds actin ﬁlaments with a stronger afﬁnity ( 7 nM ; Matova et al . , 1999 ) . Low speed cosedimentation assays show that VLN1 is an efﬁcient bundler with a maximum effect at a ratio of 1 : 6 villin to actin ( data not shown ) . Both the afﬁnity of VLN1 for actin ﬁlaments and the bundling activity were independent of free Ca 2 þ concentrations ranging from 4 . 6 nM to 1 mM . Moreover , and distinct from the lily pollen villins 135 - ABP and 115 - ABP ( Yokota et al . , 2000 , 2003 ) , bundling was unaffected by up to 500 m M free Ca 2 þ and 10 m M CaM . The effect of VLN1 on actin assembly was characterized with a combination of light scattering , pyrene ﬂuorescence , and light microscopy . An increase in light scattering can reﬂect both an increase in the amount of polymerized actin and a bundling effect , whereas pyrene ﬂuorescence is not affected by bundling and reﬂects only an increase in the amount of polymerized actin . Duringactinpolymerization , thepresenceofVLN1inducesalarge increaseoflightscatteringbutnochangeinpyreneﬂuorescence , suggesting that VLN1 is only an actin ﬁlament bundling protein . Direct visualization of actin ﬁlaments by light microscopy con - ﬁrmed the bundling activity of VLN1 . The presence of VLN1 in the polymerization mixture transforms individual actin ﬁlaments into large actin ﬁlament bundles of more than 50 m m in length . Together with the fact that VLN1 has no effect in the seeded elongation assay or on ﬁlament depolymerization , our data are consistent with VLN1 being a simple actin ﬁlament bundling protein that is not regulated by Ca 2 þ / CaM . Multiple Ca 2 þ binding sites have been identiﬁed in villin ( Hesterberg and Weber , 1983 ) . The Ca 2 þ binding sites in the core region ( gelsolin homology domains ) are responsible for the Ca 2 þ - dependent activation of villin , whereas Ca 2 þ binding in the headpiece domain is not involved in any calcium regulated function of villin ( Glenney and Weber , 1981 ; Arpin et al . , 1988 ; Bazari et al . , 1988 ; Kumar and Khurana , 2004 ) . Based on the high sequence homology between the core domains of gelsolin and villin it is fair to propose that the mechanism of Ca 2 þ - dependent activation for gelsolin and villin will be similar . Indeed , the NMR structure of human villin shows conserved residues with gelsolin in type 1 Ca 2 þ binding sites ( Markus et al . , 1997 ; Choe et al . , 2002 ) . Sequence alignment predicted that VLN1 would have a minimal Ca 2 þ - dependent activation ( Figure 1 ) . Compared with other plant villins , VLN1 has the fewest potential Ca 2 þ binding sites with only one type 2 site in G2 and a potential second site in G4 . Lily pollen 135 - ABP ( Vidali et al . , 1999 ) , VLN2 , and VLN3 have the most , with four type 2 Ca 2 þ - sites in G1 , G2 , G4 , and G6 , suggesting that some of the core activities of these villins will be relatively more Ca 2 þ - sensitive . Dissection of Ca 2 þ - sensitive sites involved in the control of capping and depolymerization induced by human villin identiﬁed two functional types of Ca 2 þ - sensitive sites .

( D ) Bundles of actin ﬁlaments in the presence of 500 nM VLN1 . 494 The Plant Cell Ala93 , Asp61 , respectively ; red crosses , Figure 1 ) control actin depolymerization , whereas the G1 type 2 site alone is respon - sible for regulation of actin capping ( Burtnick et al . , 2004 ; Kumar et al . , 2004 ) . Glu25 , Asp44 , and Ala93 are conserved in all plant villins except VLN1 . Moreover , mutation of Ala93 by another uncharged amino acid ( Gly ) inhibits the conformational changes induced by Ca 2 þ in the G1 domain of human villin ( Kumar and Khurana , 2004 ) . In VLN1 , Ala93 is replaced by Thr , a polar uncharged amino acid , providing a potential explanation for the lack of Ca 2 þ - sensitive depolymerization activity in VLN1 . The Ca 2 þ - insensitive villin - related protein QUAIL has one type 2 site in G5 and one type 1 site in G1 . QUAIL is missing eight residues from the G1 - G2 linker ; hence , this protein cannot reach from the capping site of G1 to the ﬁlament binding site of G2 ( Burtnick et al . , 2004 ) , meaning that it will not be able to sever . However , the plant villins appear to have a conserved tail latch ( Figure 1 ) . Despite the lack of Ca 2 þ activation for VLN1 , this protein is able to crosslink ﬁlaments , which suggests that the tail latch is released by another mechanism . A possible mechanism would be that actin ﬁlament binding by the villin headpiece releases the tail latch from G2 , exposing the ﬁlament binding surface of G2 and allowing interaction with a second ﬁlament . The biochemical analysis determined that VLN1 not only is insensitive to calcium but also lacks the actin capping / severing functionality of human gelsolin and villin . A more detailed look at theconservation ofthe actinbinding residues inVLN1 showsthat many ofthese residues are absent fromthe capping domains ( G1 and G4 ; red and green highlighting , Figure 1 ) . Furthermore , actin binding residues in the structural variable region of G2 are also absent . This region snakes across the surface of actin linking the capping domain , G1 , to the side binding domain , G2 ( Burtnick et al . , 2004 ) . In contrast with the actin binding site of G2 , the F - actin binding domain appears to be present ( residues 199 – 206 ; red and green highlighting , Figure 1 ) . Taken together , VLN1 shows sequence variation with respect to human gelsolin and villin that is consistent with its loss of capping and severing functionalities and with its inability to respond to calcium . In plant cells , actin ﬁlaments are often organized in long actin cables ( or bundles ) ; these structures are used as tracks for cytoplasmic streaming , which is essential for transporting ma - terial required for cell elongation ( Shimmen and Yokota , 2004 ) . During pollen tube growth , an example of tip growth , there is remarkable coordination between cell expansion , Ca 2 þ oscilla - tions , and actin polymerization / depolymerization . Increases in cytosolic free calcium ( [ Ca 2 þ ] i ) are correlated with a decrease in Figure 6 . VLN1 Does Not Have Nucleation , Capping , or Severing Activity . ( A ) VLN1 lacks nucleation activity . VLN1 or GS at the concentrations noted on the ﬁgure were incubated for 5 min with 2 m M actin ( 5 % pyrene - labeled ) before polymerization . Pyrene ﬂuorescence was plotted versus time after addition of polymerization buffer . ( B ) VLN1 lacks capping activity . Preformed F - actin ( 0 . 4 m M ) seeds were incubated with different concentrations of VLN1 and GS , as noted on the ﬁgure . One micromolar G - actin saturated with 4 m M human proﬁlin I was added to initiate actin elongation at the barbed end . The change in pyrene - actin ﬂuorescence accompanying polymerization was plotted versus time after addition of G - actin . ( C ) VLN1 lacks severing activity . Zea mays proﬁlin ( ZmPRO5 ; 2 . 5 m M ) alone or ZmPRO5 together with VLN1 or GS were added to a F - actin solution prepared from 2 . 5 m M actin ( 40 – 50 % pyrene - labeled ) . Depoly - merization was recorded by reduction in pyrene ﬂuorescence beginning from the addition of protein . All reactions are performed in the presence of 10 m M free Ca 2 þ . Arabidopsis VILLIN1 495 actin ﬁlaments near the tip , but actin cables present all along the pollen tube seem resistant to these [ Ca 2 þ ] i changes ( Fu et al . , 2001 ) . The presence of actin bundles generated by VLN1 will protect these actin ﬁlaments against depolymerization induced by [ Ca 2 þ ] i oscillations . 115 - ABP and 135 - ABP colocalize with long actin cables ( or bundles ) in lily pollen , but these two villins are Ca 2 þ / CaM - sensitive ( Yokota et al . , 2000 , 2003 ) . An increase in [ Ca 2 þ ] i should induce actin ﬁlament fragmentation and further depolymerization of actin cables by both lily villins ( Yokota and Shimmen , 2000 ) , similar to the reorganization of actin ﬁlaments observed at the apex of the pollen tube . Identiﬁcation of gelsolin from Papaver rhoeas pollen ( Huang et al . , 2004 ) and fragmin from L . davidii pollen ( Fan et al . , 2004 ) provide alternative mechanisms used by plants to regulate Ca 2 þ - mediated fragmentation and depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments . GeneChip data indicate that VLN1 and VLN2 are indeed expressed in Arabidopsis pollen , but neither isoform is very abundant ( C . Pina , J . Becker , and J . Feijo ´ , personal communication ) . By comparison , VLN5 , which is pre - dicted to be a Ca 2 þ - regulated severing and capping protein , is highly abundant in pollen . VLN5 and VLN2 , with three or four conserved type - 1 Ca 2 þ binding sites , respectively ( Figure 1 ) , are likely to be the major villin / gelsolin isoforms that respond to Ca 2 þ ﬂuxes in the pollen tube apical region , whereas VLN1 may stabilize the axial actin cables . More work is clearly needed to understand how the different isoforms of villin and gelsolin are coordinated to generate actin cables that are Ca 2 þ - sensitive or - insensitive depending on their in vivo functions and subcellular distribution . The presence of VLN1 , a Ca 2 þ - insensitive villin / gelsolin family member , may reﬂect an adaptation of plants to separate Ca 2 þ - signaling and direct control of actin dynamics to maintain the stability of the actin cables . Klahre et al . ( 2000 ) show that VLN1 , although less abundant than other isoforms , is expressed in all tissues examined by RNA gel blot analysis . Promoter - GUS fusions demonstrate high levels of VLN1 in root and leaf vas - cular tissue , root tips , guard cells , and trichomes ( Klahre et al . , 2000 ) . A query of current microarray databases using the GENEVESTIGATOR program ( www . genevestigator . ethz . ch ; Zimmermann et al . , 2004 ) conﬁrms that VLN1 is widely ex - pressed during the development of Arabidopsis plants , but may be upregulated during bolting . Tissue microarray data indicate an abundance of VLN1 transcript in hypocotyls and the shoot apex , butdiminishedlevelsinsenescingleaves , adultandcauline leaves , sepals , andcotyledons . Moreover , VLN1isupregulatedin response to several types of stress , including temperature and osmotic stress , as well as infection with Agrobacterium tumefa - ciens . This seems signiﬁcant because many biotic and abiotic stresses stimulate transient changes in cytosolic Ca 2 þ and rearrangements of the cytoskeleton ( Staiger , 2000 ; Drøbak et al . , 2004 ) . Localization data with isoform - speciﬁc antibodies , or full - length VILLIN – GFP fusion proteins , will provide further information about where within the plant the different isoforms are distributed and whether they associate with speciﬁc actin arrays at the subcellular level . Finally , reverse - genetic analyses can be used to dissect a role for VILLIN in stabilization of actin ﬁlaments and generation of bundled arrays . In particular , inser - tional mutants will facilitate analyses of functional redundancy between VILLIN isoforms , as well as between VILLIN and Figure 7 .

If VLN1 function is partially redundant , we predict that the protein with overlapping function and expression pattern is Arabidopsis FIMBRIN2 . This actin bundling protein has nearly identical biochemical properties , including Ca 2 þ - independent ﬁlament bundling activity and the ability to stabilize ﬁlaments against dilution - and proﬁlin - mediated depolymerization , as well as a similar expression pattern in the plant ( L . Y . Gao , D . W . McCurdy , and C . J . Staiger , unpublished data ) . In addition to Ca 2 þ - induced actin depolymerization , a major actin depolymerizing factor in plants is ADF / coﬁlin ( Lopez et al . , 1996 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Ressad et al . , 1998 ; Dong et al . , 2001 ; Smertenko et al . , 2001 ; Chen et al . , 2002 ; Hussey et al . , 2002 ; Maciver and Hussey , 2002 ) . After actin polymerization , ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release control ADF / coﬁlin binding and depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) . As ADF / coﬁlin increases the rate of phosphate release from actin ﬁlaments ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) , depolymerization will occur rapidly ( t 1 / 2 < 30 s ; Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . Long - lived actin cables ( or bundles ) have to be pro - tectedagainstADF - inducedactindepolymerization ( Pollardetal . , 2000 ) . Preformed bundles of actin ﬁlaments generated by VLN1 are protected against depolymerization induced by ADF1 , sug - gesting a similar effect between VLN1 and tropomyosin , which inhibits ADF / coﬁlin binding and depolymerization ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ; Nishida et al . , 1985 ) . Pope et al . ( 1994 ) showed that the villin headpiece competes with human ADF for binding to actin ﬁlaments but did not demonstrate a protection against depolymerization . Which region of VLN1 stabilizes ﬁlaments , whether it is the gelsolin - like core , the headpiece , or both , has not been determined . During active polymerization , the situation is more complex because to protect actin ﬁlaments against ADF / coﬁlin , VLN1has to bind ﬁrstto actin ﬁlaments and rapidly bundle them . We found that as actin ﬁlaments elongate VLN1 indeed binds before any appreciable binding of ADF / coﬁlin . A possible explanation is that the binding of ADF / coﬁlin to actin ﬁlaments is delayed by ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release from the ﬁlament , whereas the binding of villin to actin ﬁlaments is independent of the nucleotide state of actin ﬁlaments . In agree - ment with this data , a moderate amount of GFP - NtADF ex - pressed in pollen tubes is localized with actin ﬁlaments of the fringe region near the apex and not with actin ﬁlament cables deeper in the pollen tube ( Chen et al . , 2002 ) . The Arabidopsis villin family contains multiple isoforms of actin binding proteins that are likely to play central roles in regulating Figure 8 . Micrograph of Actin Filaments in the Presence of VLN1 and ADF .

Understanding the function of the actin cytoskeleton requires detailed knowledge of how different classes of actin binding protein work in concert or in competition to construct or dismantle populations of ﬁlaments . VLN1 is the ﬁrst plant villin to be described with a function that is independent of [ Ca 2 þ ] . Its biochemical properties are consistent with a role in creating and / or stabilizing actin ﬁlament bundles , such as those found in pollen tubes and roothairs or inthe transvacuolar cytoplasmic strands of highly vacuolate cells . Villin was originally discovered as the major actin binding protein of the intestinal microvillus ( Bretscher and Weber , 1979 , 1980 ) . Perhaps similar to plant cells , microvilli lack tropomyosin and have a population of stable actin ﬁlaments ( Heintzelman and Mooseker , 1992 ) . Our ﬁndings provide insight to why villin - containing actin ﬁlament bundles in microvilli are stabilized against the major actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF / coﬁlin ) . METHODS Protein Production Afull - lengthcDNAfor ArabidopsisthalianaVLN1 wasisolatedfromasize - fractionated root cDNA library ( CD4 - 16 ; Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center , Ohio State University ) using the EST H5D9 ( Hin dIII fragment ) as a probe . TheclonewassequencedandconﬁrmedtomatchexactlyacDNA with accession number AF081201 present in GenBank ( Klahre et al . , 2000 ) . The coding sequence for VLN1 was ampliﬁed by PCR , subcloned into pET23a , and conﬁrmed by sequencing . The VLN1 - pET23a construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells and grown over - nightat37 8 C .

Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , supplemented with a 1 : 200 dilution of protease inhibitors from a stock solution ( Ren et al . , 1997 ) , and sonicated . The sonicate was clariﬁed at 46 , 000 g . The VLN1 protein was precipitated from the supernatant with ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 at 45 % saturation . The pellet was dissolved in Solution A containing 10 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , and 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 0 , supplemented with a 1 : 200 dilution of protease inhibitors , and the protein was dialyzed against the same solution and clariﬁedat46 , 000 g .

Boundproteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl ( 140 – 500 mM ) . The puriﬁed VLN1 was dialyzed against Buffer G ( 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2mMATP , and0 . 2mMDTT ) , aliquoted , frozeninliquidnitrogen , and stored at (cid:1) 80 8 C . VLN1 concentrations were determined by Bradford assay ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) with BSA as a standard . Arabidopsis ADF1 , maize ( Zea mays ) PROFILIN5 ( ZmPRO5 ) , and Arabidopsis FIM1 were puriﬁed as described previously ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Kovar et al . , 2000a , 2000b ) . GS plasmid was kindly provided by T . Pollard ( Yale University ) . Recombinant GS was puriﬁed from bacte - rial cells roughly according to Pope et al . ( 1997 ) initially with DEAE - Sepharose and further puriﬁed by Cibacron Blue 3G - A . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) , and monomeric Ca - ATP - actin was puriﬁed by Sephacryl S - 300 chromatography ( Pollard , 1984 ) in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 0 . 1 mM azide ) .

Actin concentration was determined by spectrometry assuming an A 290 for a 1 mg / mL solution of 0 . 63 . High - Speed and Low - Speed Cosedimentation Assays High - and low - speed cosedimentation assays were used to examine the actin binding and actin - bundling properties of VLN1 , respectively ( Kovar et al . , 2000b ) . All proteins were preclariﬁed at 140 , 000 g before an experiment . In a 200 - m L reaction volume either 3 . 0 m M G - actin alone , 1 . 0 m M VLN1 alone , or G - actin with VLN1 was incubated in 1 3 F - buffer ( 10 3 stock : 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM DTT , 5 mM ATP , 1 M KCl , and 50 mM MgCl 2 ) in the presence of 1 . 0 mM EGTA ( added from a 100 - mM stock in 1 3 F - buffer ) . The ﬁnal concentration of free calcium , [ Ca 2 þ ] , was 4 . 6 nM . Free Ca 2 þ was calculated with EGTA software by Petesmif ( PM Smith , University of Liverpool , UK ) , available at http : / / www . liv . ac . uk / luds / people / cds / bds / pms / cal . htm / . After a 90 - min incubation at 22 8 C , samples were centrifuged at either 200 , 000 g for 1 h in a TL - 100 centrifuge ( Beckman , Palo Alto , CA ) at 4 8 C , or 13 , 500 g for 30 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 8 C . After the supernatant was removed , protein sample buffer was added to the supernatant and the pellet . Equal amounts of pellet and supernatant samples were separated by 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . High - and low - speed cosedimentation experiments were also used to determine the effect of varying [ Ca 2 þ ] on actin binding and bundling activities of VLN1 . In these experiments , either 1 . 0 m M VLN1 alone , 3 . 0 m Mactinalone , or1 . 0 m MVLN1with3 . 0 m Mactinwasincubatedin1 3 F - buffer ( 200 m Ltotalreaction volume ) in thepresence of4 . 6nM , 100nM , 1 . 0 m M , 12 m M , or 1 . 0 mM free Ca 2 þ for 90 min at 22 8 C . After 80 m L was removedandaddedto20 m Lof5 3 proteinsamplebuffer ( totalprotein ; T ) , the remaining 120 m L was centrifuged as described above . Supernatant ( 80 m L ) was removed and added to 20 m L 5 3 protein sample buffer . After removal of residual supernatant , the pellets were resuspended in 50 m L 2 3 protein sample buffer . Equal amounts of total protein ( 12 m L ) , supernatant ( 12 m L ) , and pellet ( 4 m L ) were separated by 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R . Gels were scanned , and the intensity of bands was determined with IMAGEQUANT software ( Personal Densitometer ; Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Actin and VLN1 from total protein lanes served as internal controls for gel loading . Todetermine a dissociation constant ( K d ) ( Kovaret al . , 2000b ) , increasing amounts ( 0 . 3 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 8 , 1 . 2 , 1 . 8 , 2 . 4 , 2 . 6 , 3 . 0 , and 3 . 4 m M ) of VLN1 or FIM1 were incubated with 3 . 0 m M preassembled F - actin for 60 min at 22 8 C . The samples were centrifuged at 200 , 000 g for 1 h . The amount of VLN1 and FIM1 in the pellets or supernatant was quantiﬁed by scanning Coomassie - stained gels , using known amounts of VLN1 and FIM1 to generate standard curves . A K d value for VLN1 and FIM1 bound to actin was calculated by ﬁtting the data of protein bound versus protein free to ahyperbolicfunctionwithKaleidagraphv3 . 6software ( SynergySoftware , Reading , PA ) . Nucleation Assay Actin nucleation was performed essentially as described by Schafer et al . ( 1996 ) . Monomeric actin at 2 m M ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) was incubated with VLN1 or GS for 5 min in Buffer G . Fluorescence of pyrene - actin was monitored with a PTI Quantamaster spectroﬂuorimeter ( QM - 2000 - SE ; Photon Technology International , South Brunswick , NJ ) after the addition 498 The Plant Cell of1 / 10volumeof10 3 KMEI ( 1 3 contains50mMKCl , 1mMMgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , and 10 mM imidazole - HCl , pH 7 . 0 ) . Capping of Actin Filament Ends Various concentrations of VLN1 or GS were incubated with 0 . 4 m M preformed actin ﬁlaments in KMEI supplemented with 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 3 mM NaN 3 for 5 min at room tempera - ture . The ﬁnal free [ Ca 2 þ ] was 1 m M . The reaction mixture was supple - mented with 1 m M G - actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) saturated by 4 m M human proﬁlin 1 to initiate actin elongation at barbed ends . Kinetics Studies of Actin Polymerization and Depolymerization Polymerization of actin in the presence of VLN1 and ADF1 was measured by changes in pyrene ﬂuorescence using a ﬂuorescence spectrophotom - eter ( model Safas Xenius , Safas SA , Monaco ) . Depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments was performed roughly as described by Huang et al . ( 2004 ) . F - actinat2 . 5 m M ( 40 – 50 % pyrenelabeled ) wasdepolymerizedbyaddition ofanequimolaramountofZmPRO5 , inthepresenceorabsenceofVLN1or GS . The decrease in pyrene ﬂuorescence accompanying actin depoly - merization was monitored for 800 s after addition of proﬁlin . The ﬁnal free [ Ca 2 þ ] was 10 m M for all reactions . For ADF induced depolymerization assay , F - actinwasdepolymerizedbyadditionof0 . 6 m MADF1and / or8 m M latrunculin B . To test the effect of VLN1 , F - actin was preincubated with VLN1 for 5min atroomtemperature . The decreaseofpyreneﬂuorescence was monitored after addition of ADF and / or latrunculin B . Light Scattering Assay to Measure Bundling Activity A kinetic light scattering assay was performed to determine the ability of VLN1 to form actin bundles during polymerization . Light scattering was monitored by 90 8 light scattering of unlabeled actin at 400 nm . The change of light scattering was recorded after addition of polymerization salts to VLN1 and G - actin solutions . Fluorescence Microscopy of Actin Filaments Individual actin ﬁlaments labeled with ﬂuorescent phalloidin were imaged byﬂuorescencemicroscopyaccordingtoBlanchoinetal . ( 2000a , 2000b ) . Actin at 4 m M alone , or together with VLN1 , was polymerized in 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5mM DTT , 3 mM NaN 3 , and 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , at 25 8 C for 30 min and labeled withanequimolaramountofrhodamine - phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) during polymerization . The polymerized F - actin was diluted to 10 nM in ﬂuores - cence buffer containing 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM DTT , 100 m g / mL glucose oxidase , 15 mg / mL glucose , 20 m g / mL catalase , and 0 . 5 % methylcellulose . A dilute sample of 3 m L was applied to a 22 3 22 - mm cover slip coated with poly - L - lysine ( 0 . 01 % ) . Actin ﬁlaments were observed by epiﬂuorescence illumination under a Nikon Microphot SA microscope ( Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with a 60 3 , 1 . 4 NA Planapo objective and digital images were collected with a Hamamatsu ORCA - ER 12 - bit CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Hamamatsu City , Japan ) using Metamorph ( version 6 . 0 ) software ( Uni - versal Imaging , Downingtown , PA ) .
