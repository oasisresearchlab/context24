Specific and common alterations in host gene transcript accumulation following infection of the chestnut blight fungus by mild and severe hypoviruses . 1 Title Specific and common alterations in host gene transcript accumulation following infection of the chestnut blight fungus by mild and severe hypoviruses . Publication Type Journal Article Year of Publication 2004 Authors Allen , TD , Nuss , DL Journal J Virol Volume 78 Issue 8 Pagination 4145 - 55 Date Published 2004 Apr ISSN 0022 - 538X Keywords Ascomycota , Gene Expression Profiling , Genes , Fungal , Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Abstract We report the use of a cDNA microarray to monitor global transcriptional responses of the chestnut blight fungus , Cryphonectria parasitica , to infection by mild and severe isolates of virulence - attenuating hypoviruses that share 87 to 93 % and 90 to 98 % identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels , respectively . Infection by the mild hypovirus isolate CHV1 - Euro7 resulted in differential expression of 166 of the ca . 2 , 200 genes represented on the microarray ( 90 upregulated and 76 downregulated ) . This is roughly half the number of genes scored as differentially expressed after infection by the severe isolate , CHV1 - EP713 ( 295 genes ; 132 upregulated and 163 downregulated ) . Comparison of the lists of genes responsive to infection by the two hypovirus isolates revealed 80 virus - common responsive genes . Infection by CHV1 - EP713 also caused changes in gene transcript accumulation that were , in general , of greater magnitude than those observed with CHV1 - Euro7 infections . Thus , the host transcriptional response to infection by severe hypovirus CHV1 - EP713 appears to be considerably more dynamic than the response to infection by the mild isolate CHV1 - Euro7 . Real - time reverse transcription - PCR was performed on 39 different clones , with false - positive rates of 3 and 8 % observed for the microarray - predicted list of genes responsive to CHV1 - EP713 and CHV1 - Euro7 infections , respectively . This analysis has allowed an initial assignment for ca . 2 , 200 unique C . parasitica - expressed genes as being unresponsive to hypovirus infection , selectively responsive to a specific hypovirus , or generally responsive to hypovirus infection .
