419 A ngiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones , is critical for tissue development , tissue repair , as well as many diseases including diabetic retinopathy and tumor growth . 1 Directional migration of endothelial cells ( EC ) toward a gradient of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) determines vascular formation , which is a hallmark of tumor angiogenesis . 1 – 3 This process involves 3 highly coor - dinated and regulated steps : sensing the stimuli , cytoskeleton rearrangement , and lastly movement of the cell . Lamellipodia are the critical structures for cell directional migration and they are regions of very rapid actin remodeling , which is mainly mediated by the cortical actin remodeling protein , cortactin . 4 Cortactin has emerged as a key signaling protein in many cellular processes , including cell adhesion , migration , angio - genesis , and tumor invasion . 5 , 6 Serine 405 phosphorylation by extracellular signal – regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) in the SRC homology 3 domain of cortactin is required for cortical actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration . 7 – 9 The work of Weed et al 10 found that active Rac1 / Cdc42 induced cortactin - mediated lamellipodia formation . Recent work also revealed the involvement of Cdc42 - associated kinase 1 in inducing cortactin activation to promote cortical actin remodeling via Arp2 / 3 - nWiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein complex . 11 G - protein – coupled receptor kinase – interacting protein - 1 ( GIT1 ) is a multidomain protein involved in diverse cellular processes , including cell adhesion , migration , 12 and permeabil - ity . 13 GIT1 , being a scaffold protein , interacts with other pro - teins , which can affect its cellular localization and activity . The full - length GIT1 protein has an N - terminal ADP - ribosylation factor GTPase - activating protein domain , 3 ankyrin repeats , a Spa2 - homology domain ( SHD ) , a synaptic localizing domain and a paxillin - binding site . 14 We previously showed that GIT1 is © 2013 American Heart Association , Inc . Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol is available at http : / / atvb . ahajournals . org DOI : 10 . 1161 / ATVBAHA . 113 . 302689 Objective — Recent evidence suggests G - protein – coupled receptor - 2 – interacting protein - 1 ( GIT1 ) overexpression in several human metastatic tumors , including breast , lung , and prostate . Tumor metastasis is associated with an increase in angiogenesis . We have showed previously that GIT1 is required for postnatal angiogenesis during lung development . However , the functional role of GIT1 in pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown . Approach and Results — In the present study , we show inhibition of angiogenesis in matrigel implants as well as reduced tumor angiogenesis and melanoma tumor growth in GIT1 - knockout mice . We demonstrate that this is a result of impaired directional migration of GIT1 - depleted endothelial cells toward a vascular endothelial growth factor gradient . Cortactin - mediated lamellipodia formation in the leading edge is critical for directional migration . We observed a significant reduction in cortactin localization and lamellipodia formation in the leading edge of GIT1 - depleted endothelial cells . We specifically identified that the Spa homology domain ( aa 250 – 420 ) of GIT1 is required for GIT1 – cortactin complex localization to the leading edge . The mechanisms involved extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 – mediated Cortactin - S405 phosphorylation and activation of Rac1 / Cdc42 . Finally , using gain of function studies , we show that a constitutively active mutant of cortactin restored directional migration of GIT1 - depleted cells . Conclusion — Our data demonstrated that a GIT1 – cortactin association through GIT1 - Spa homology domain is required for cortactin localization to the leading edge and is essential for endothelial cell directional migration and tumor angiogenesis .

Materials and Methods Materials and Methods are available in the online - only Supplement . Results GIT1 Is Required for Angiogenesis in Matrigel Plugs Matrigel plug assay is a commonly used angiogenesis model , which resembles pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth . 20 Plugs placed onto GIT1 - knockout ( KO ) mice clearly exhibited fewer vessels compared with GIT1 - wild type ( WT ) after 7 days of incubation ( Figure 1A ) . Also , hematoxylin and eosin staining showed fewer EC in the matrigel plugs of GIT1 - KO implants compared with GIT1 - WT ( Figure 1A ) . Isolectin B4 staining revealed a 45 % increase in vessel density in VEGF - treated matrigel plugs of GIT1 - WT mice compared with vehicle - treated controls ( Figure 1A and 1B ) . Significantly , we observed a 68 % reduction in vessel density in plugs of GIT1 - KO mice compared with GIT1 - WT controls treated with VEGF ( Figure 1B ) . Together , these data suggest that GIT1 is required for VEGF - mediated angiogenesis in matrigel implants . Melanoma Tumor Growth and Tumor Angiogenesis Are Reduced in GIT1 - KO Mice Melanoma tumor cells secrete high quantities of VEGF . 21 VEGF - induced directional migration of EC is critical for angiogenesis to support tumor growth . Therefore , we chose this tumor model to study the effect of GIT1 on tumor angiogen - esis and growth . An equivalent number of tumor cells ( B16 - F0 cell line , a melanoma spontaneously arising in C57BL / 6 mice ) which secrets VEGF , were injected intramuscular into GIT1 - WT and GIT1 - KO mice ( 2 – 3 months ) and the thigh diam - eters were measured over time ≤ 15 days . The tumor volume in GIT1 - WT and GIT1 - KO mice was similar ≤ 12 days post injec - tion . However , tumor volume in GIT1 - KO was significantly reduced after 13 days compared with WT ( Figure 1C ; 45 % at 15 days ) . Isolectin B4 staining showed significant reduction ( 83 % and 61 % ) in vessels of smaller size ( 0 – 20 and 20 – 50 μ m , respectively ) in GIT1 - KO mice ( Figure 1D and 1E ) , whereas no difference was observed in vessels > 50 μ m between GIT1 - WT and GIT1 - KO mice ( Figure 1D and 1E ) . Western blots revealed a 54 % decrease in platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - 1 expression in GIT1 - KO versus GIT1 - WT at 15 days ( Figure 1F and 1G ) . These data demonstrate that GIT1 is an important regulator of tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth . GIT1 Is Required for EC Directional Migration Toward VEGF Gradient Angiogenesis requires directional migration of EC toward a stimuli . 1 As we observed reduced angiogenesis in matrigel plugs containing VEGF and in a melanoma tumor model in the KO mouse compared with WT , we anticipated that the defect in tumor angiogenesis in GIT1 - KO mice could be because of altered directional migration of GIT1 - KO EC toward VEGF . Therefore , we performed a Dunn’s chamber experiment using control and GIT1 - specific small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) – transfected human umbilical vein EC ( HUVEC ) . HUVEC treated with con - trol siRNA migrated directionally in response to a VEGF gradi - ent ( Figure 2A and 2B ; Movies I and II in the online - only Data Supplement ) . In contrast , cells treated with GIT1 siRNA showed significantly decreased migration toward the gradient ( Figure 2A and 2B ; Movie III in the online - only Data Supplement ) . There was also a significant decrease in velocity of GIT1 siRNA – treated cells versus control siRNA – treated cells ( 6 versus 18 μ m / h ; Figure 2C ) . Western blot analysis of GIT1 siRNA – transfected HUVEC revealed a 90 % decrease in GIT1 protein compared with control siRNA – transfected control ( Figure 2C , inset ) . These data demonstrate that GIT1 plays a significant role in directional migration of EC toward a VEGF gradient . GIT1 Is Required for Cortactin Localization to the Leading Edge of EC In Vitro Cortactin - mediated lamellipodia formation in the leading edge is important for directional migration . 7 We next performed wound healing assay using mouse lung microvascular EC ( MLMEC ) . There was a 57 % decrease in cortactin localiza - tion to the leading edge in GIT1 - KO MLMEC compared with GIT1 - WT MLMEC near the wound ( Figure 3A ; n = 3 ; P < 0 . 05 ) . To confirm these data , we determined cortactin localiza - tion in GIT1 siRNA – treated HUVEC . Control siRNA – treated cells exhibited VEGF - stimulated actin filament reorganization and showed dramatically increased cortactin in lamellipodia like structures that colocalized with actin at the leading edge ( Figure IA in the online - only Data Supplement ) . Both lamel - lipodia formation and cortactin localization were decreased markedly in HUVEC transfected with GIT1 siRNA ; 61 % reduction in unstimulated cells and 73 % in VEGF - stimulated cells ( Figure IA and IB in the online - only Data Supplement ) .

There was a significant 68 % decrease in sprout length ( Figure IIA – IIC in the online - only Data Supplement ) and 84 % reduction of cortactin localization in the leading edge of GIT1 - KO aortas compared with WT control ( Figue IID – IIJ in the online - only Data Supplement ) . To confirm that cortactin mislocalization in GIT1 - KO EC is directly attributable to the loss of GIT1 , we performed a rescue experiment by overexpressing GIT1 in GIT1 - KO MLMEC using a GIT1 - expressing cytomegalovirus pro - moter – based lentiviral expression vector in which GIT1 is expressed on an internal ribosome entry site - containing bicis - tronic mRNA that also expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein . We detected green fluorescent protein expression in ≈ 60 % of GIT1 - KO MLMEC infected with either vector control or GIT1 - containing lentivirus ( Figure 3B ) . GIT1 - WT MLMEC showed high level of cortactin in leading edge , whereas GIT1 - KO MLMEC infected with control lentivirus had only 33 % of the cortactin in the leading edge . However , overexpression of GIT1 in GIT1 - KO MLMEC restored cor - tactin localization to the leading edge of migrating EC to 94 % ( n = 3 ; P < 0 . 05 ) . Expression of GIT1 in GIT1 - KO MLMEC was confirmed by Western blot ( data not shown ) . These results show that GIT1 is required for cortactin localization to the leading edge of EC during directional migration . SHD of GIT1 Is Required for GIT1 – Cortactin Association and Membrane Localization to Induce EC Migration To characterize the mechanism by which GIT1 regulates cortactin localization in EC , we used an in vitro wound healing assay using HUVEC . VEGF ( 10 ng / mL , for 6 hours ) stimulated a 2 . 2 - fold increase in colocalization of GIT1 and cortactin at the leading edge ( Figure IIIA and IIIB in the online - only Data Supplement ) . Immunoprecipitation of GIT1 from HUVEC stimulated with VEGF ( 10 ng / mL , 15 minutes ) showed a 6 - fold increase in GIT1 Figure 1 . G - protein – coupled receptor - 2 – interacting protein ( GIT1 ) is required for tumor angiogenesis . A , Matrigel ( 250 μ L ) containing vehicle control or vascular endo - thelial growth factor ( VEGF ; 50 ng / mL ) was injected subcutaneously on the ventral side of the mouse in the groin area . Plugs were isolated 7 days post injection .

C , Melanoma tumor cells were injected into the thigh muscle of GIT1 - wild type ( WT ; n = 5 ) and GIT1 - knockout ( KO ; n = 5 ) mice . Mean thigh diameters were determined and increased tumor volume was calculated . D and E , Tumors from GIT1 - WT and GIT1 - KO mice were harvested at day 15 after injection . Tumor tissue sections were stained with IB4 and images were acquired in ×10 and ×40 objective . The number of vessels in 3 different diameter groups ( > 50 [ yellow arrow ] , > 20 – ≤ 50 [ green arrow ] , and ≤ 20 μ m [ white arrow ] ) was counted manually using Image Pro Plus software . * Vs WT ( n = 5 ; * P < 0 . 05 ) .

A , Human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) cultured on fibronectin - coated cover glasses was transfected with either scrambled control ( Con ) or GIT1 - specific small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) for 24 hours , loaded on Dunn’s chamber with a VEGF ( 50 ng / mL ) gradient and placed into a live cell imaging chamber . Cells were imaged for 24 hours at 10 - minute intervals . Videos obtained from live cell imaging experi - ments were analyzed using Image Pro Plus software .

Furthermore a 4 - fold increase in the level of phos - phorylated S405 - cortactin in the GIT1 – cortactin complex was observed on VEGF stimulation ( Figure IIIC in the online - only Data Supplement ) . To identify the cellular compartment of GIT1 – cortactin association , we performed cell fractionation and found that GIT1 – cortactin association maximally occurs in the mem - brane of EC ( Figure IIID in the online - only Data Supplement ) . To identify the specific domain of GIT1 responsible for asso - ciation with cortactin , we transfected GIT1 - KO MLMEC with GIT1 deletion mutants that lacked predicted binding domains . Extensive colocalization of GIT1 mutant ( green ) and cortactin ( red ) in the cell periphery was observed in MLMEC transfected with green fluorescent protein - GIT1 and green fluorescent pro - tein - GIT1 ( 1 – 420 ; Figure IV in the online - only Data Supplement ; Figure 4A ) . In contrast , GIT1 lacking the functional SHD ( del250 - 420 ) showed a 71 % decrease in colocalization at the cell periph - ery ( Figure IV in the online - only Data Supplement ; Figure 4A ) . Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of HUVEC transfected with the mutants demonstrated that full - length GIT1 and GIT1 ( 1 – 420 ) were associated with cortactin , whereas GIT1 ( del250 - 420 ) that lacks the SHD was not ( Figure 4B ) . Consistent with our previous finding in GIT1 - depleted HUVEC , 18 GIT1 - KO MLMEC showed a 49 % reduction in wound healing compared with GIT1 - WT MLMEC ( Figure 4C and 4D ) . Lentivirus - mediated overexpression of full - length GIT1 in GIT1 - KO MLMEC completely restored EC migration to 100 % , whereas GIT1 ( del250 - 420 ) overexpression had no effect ( Figure 4C and 4D ) . These data demonstrate that GIT1 - SHD mediates GIT1 and cortactin association , which is neces - sary for EC migration by localizing cortactin to the leading edge . GIT1 Is Required for VEGF - Induced Phosphorylation of Cortactin - S405 ( pS405 ) by ERK1 / 2 That Promotes Cortactin Localization to Lamellipodia ERK1 / 2 - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin - S405 is required for lamellipodia formation and cell migration . 22 In HUVEC stimulated with VEGF , fetal bovine serum , or EGF , there was an 8 - fold increase in pS405 - cortactin with a peak at 15 minutes ( Figure VA and VB in the online - only Data Supplement ) . In HUVEC transfected with GIT1 siRNA , there was a 66 % decrease in ERK1 / 2 and 70 % decrease in S405 - cortactin phosphorylation relative to control siRNA in response to VEGF ( Figure 5A ; Figure VC and VD in the online - only Data Supplement ; n = 3 ; P < 0 . 05 ) . There was no significant change in VEGF - induced phosphorylation of cor - tactin Y421 on GIT1 depletion ( required for actin filament reorganization and stress fiber formation ) after GIT1 deple - tion ( Figure VE and VF in the online - only Data Supplement ) . Furthermore , in GIT1 - KO MLMEC there was a 37 % and 43 % reduction of S405 - cortactin and ERK1 / 2 phosphory - lation , respectively , compared with GIT1 - WT MLMEC ( Figure 4E and 4F ) . Lentiviral re - expression of GIT1 in KO MLMEC almost completely recovered S405 - cortactin ( 98 % ) and ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation ( 89 % ) to the level of GIT1 - WT control ( Figure 4E and 4F ) . However , overexpression of GIT1 ( del250 - 420 ) did not restore S405 - cortactin and ERK1 / 2 phos - phorylation ( Figure 4E and 4F ) . Together these data support the role of GIT1 - SHD in promoting S405 - cortactin and ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation that is required for EC directional migration . Treatment of HUVEC with the ERK1 / 2 inhibitor PD98059 caused a decrease in EC migration , a 42 % reduction in cor - tactin at the leading edge of migrating EC and a concomitant reduction in lamellipodia formation ( Figure VIA and VII in the online - only Data Supplement ) . Treatment of HUVEC with PD98059 completely blocked VEGF - induced S405 - cortactin phosphorylation , suggesting that ERK1 / 2 is the key mediator of S405 phosphorylation of cortactin ( Figure VIJ and VIK in the online - only Data Supplement ) . These data demonstrated that blocking ERK1 / 2 activation either by GIT1 depletion or PD98059 treatment inhibited S405 - cortactin phosphorylation , which is essential for lamellipodia formation . VEGF Promotes the Formation of GIT1 – pERK1 / 2 – Cortactin Complex in the Leading Edge of EC Previously , we showed EGF - dependent increase in GIT1 association with ERK1 / 2 in focal adhesion . 23 To determine colocalization of GIT1 , pERK1 / 2 , and cortactin at the lead - ing edge of migrating EC , we performed triple staining in HUVEC . VEGF significantly increased the GIT1 – pERK1 / 2 – cortactin colocalization compared with untreated controls ( Figure 5B ; n = 3 ) . Furthermore , in the wound healing assay , there was a significant decrease in colocalization of pERK1 / 2 Figure 3 . G - protein – coupled receptor - 2 – interacting protein ( GIT1 ) localizes cortactin to the leading edge of endothelial cells ( EC ) in vitro and in vivo . A , Wounds were created in monolayers of GIT1 - wild type ( WT ) and knockout ( KO ) mouse lung microvascular EC ( MLMEC ) and healing proceeded for 6 hours . Cells were then fixed and stained for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( PECAM1 ) and cortactin ( n = 3 ) . B , GIT1 was overexpressed in GIT1 - KO MLMEC using a lentiviral vector . After 48 hours of infec - tion , cell migration in a wound healing assay was determined . Cells were fixed and stained for cortactin . Infected cells were identified by green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) expression ( n = 3 ) . by gu e s t on J u l y 31 , 2017 h tt p : / / a t vb . a h a j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Majumder et al GIT1 and Tumor Angiogenesis 423 and cortactin in HUVEC treated with GIT1 siRNA versus control siRNA ( 30 versus 94 pixel number ; Figure VIIA and VIIB in the online - only Data Supplement ) . In addition , coim - munoprecipitation studies demonstrated that pERK1 / 2 , GIT1 , and cortactin coprecipitated ( 10 ng / mL VEGF ; 15 minutes ; Figure VIIC in the online - only Data Supplement ; n = 3 ) . These data demonstrated that GIT1 , ERK1 / 2 , and cortactin form a complex that is necessary for phosphorylation of cortactin and its localization to the leading edge of migrating EC .

A , Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) were transfected with either scrambled control ( Con ) or GIT1 - specific small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) for 36 hours and then serum starved for 2 hours . Cells were stimulated with vascular endothe - lial growth factor ( VEGF ; 10 ng / mL ) and pS405 - cortactin and pERK1 / 2 were mea - sured by Western blot ( n = 3 ) . B , Wounds were created in the monolayer of HUVEC cultured on fibronectin - coated cover glasses and serum starved overnight . Next , cells were treated with VEGF ( 10 ng / mL ) and incubated for 6 hours . Cells were fixed and triple stained for pERK1 / 2 ( green ) , GIT1 ( red ) and cortactin ( blue ) . As shown by arrowhead , GIT1 – ERK1 / 2 – cortactin complex formation was detected by appearance of purple ( colocalization ) in the leading edge ( n = 3 ) . C , GIT1 - depleted HUVECs were serum starved for 2 hours followed by stimulating with VEGF ( 10 ng / mL ) for 30 minutes .

In HUVECs treated with GIT1 siRNA , VEGF - induced Rac1 and Cdc42 activation was inhib - ited by 68 % and 80 % , respectively , compared with control siRNA – treated cells ( Figure 5C and 5D ) . A previous article by Smith et al 25 showed that PAK1 activates ERK1 / 2 in mac - rophages to regulate lamellipodial stability , which suggests that Rac1 / Cdc42 is upstream of ERK1 / 2 . Therefore , we used adenoviral delivery of dominant - negative ( DN ) - Rac1 and DN - Cdc42 to study their effects on ERK1 / 2 and cortactin activation . Infection of adeno - DN - Rac1 or adeno - DN - Cdc42 in HUVEC diminished VEGF - induced ERK1 / 2 activation by 49 % and cortactin - S405 phosphorylation by 82 % ( Figure VIII in the online - only Data Supplement ) , which suggests that Rac1 and Cdc42 act upstream of ERK1 / 2 . In addition , greater reduction in cortactin phosphorylation compared with ERK1 / 2 activation implies that Rac1 / Cdc42 may also regulate cortactin activation through PAK . 26 Overall , these data showed that GIT1 promotes the localization of cortactin to lamellipo - dia through Rac1 / Cdc42 and ERK1 / 2 pathways . Expression of Constitutively Active Cortactin Rescues GIT1 - Depleted Phenotype In Vitro To confirm that the effect of GIT1 on EC migration is pS405 - cortactin dependent , we expressed a constitutively active cortactin , cortactin S405D , S418D ( mCortactin ) , in GIT1 - depleted HUVEC . After cotransfection of GIT1 siRNA and mCor - tactin , we performed a wound healing assay . GIT1 - depleted HUVEC showed 54 . 6±8 . 0 % inhibition of wound healing compared with control HUVEC ( Figure 6A – 6C ) . Expression of mCortactin in control siRNA did not stimulate HUVEC migration when compared with pcDNA vector control ( Figure 6A – 6C ) . However , mCortactin stimulated a 2 . 6 - fold increase in migration of GIT1 - depleted cells ( Figure 6A – 6C ) . We also confirmed the presence of mCortactin expressing EC in wound edge ( Figure IX in the online - only Data Supplement ) . These data show that pS405 - cortactin is necessary for GIT1 - dependent regulation of EC migration . Discussion Major findings of the present study are GIT1 is required for VEGF - induced cortactin activation and localization to leading edge to promote lamellipodia formation , which is necessary for EC directional migration and tumor angiogenesis . Three major mechanisms were identified ( see model in Figure 6D ) : ( 1 ) GIT1 increases Rac1 / Cdc42 activation through PIX – PAK complex to promote cortactin activation and localization to membrane . ( 2 ) GIT1 assembles a complex of mitogen - acti - vated protein kinase kinase - 1 – ERK1 / 2 that induces Ser405 cortactin phosphorylation . ( 3 ) GIT1 forms a complex with cor - tactin to promote cortactin membrane localization and lamelli - podia formation . In addition , we described that GIT1 - mediated activation of Rac1 / Cdc42 also contributes to ERK1 / 2 - driven activation of cortactin ( pathway 4 ) . Importantly , we identified the SHD of GIT1 as the domain essential for these functions . Figure 6 .

C , Western blot analysis of the same cells as used for wound healing to detect flag tagged cortactin expression ( n = 3 ) . D , Model outlining the role of GIT1 in EC directional migration . Pathway 1 , GIT1 activates Rac1 / Cdc42 to induce cortactin activation . Pathway 2 , On vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) stimulation GIT1 binds with mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) - 1 – extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) and further phosphorylates cortactin . Pathway 3 , GIT1 forms a complex with cortactin . Path - way 4 , Activated Rac1 / Cdc42 also contrib - utes toward ERK1 / 2 - mediated activation of cortactin . Through these mechanisms , which are mainly regulated by GIT1 - Spa homology domain ( SHD ) , cortactin is recruited to the membrane to induce lamellipodia formation and directional migration . by gu e s t on J u l y 31 , 2017 h tt p : / / a t vb . a h a j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Majumder et al GIT1 and Tumor Angiogenesis 425 Recent evidence suggested that GIT1 - mediated activation of mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase - 1 – ERK1 / 2 induces growth in human liver and colon cancer . 19 Several data , includ - ing Genecard analysis of human tumors , suggested increased GIT1 expression in several metastatic tumors , including breast , lung , and prostate . 18 , 19 These data all suggest a crucial role of GIT1 in tumor progression . Long established evidence suggested that tumor metastasis is correlated with the extent of vascular structure and increases in angiogenesis that sup - ports the metastatic potential of tumor cells . 27 Our findings reveal that GIT1 is required for tumor angiogenesis to sup - port the growth of tumors . Deletion of GIT1 diminished tumor microvasculature density and prevented tumor growth . We specifically identified that the major reason behind this effect is because of compromised directional migration of GIT1 - depleted EC toward a VEGF gradient . GIT1 promotes the assembly of signaling complexes in focal adhesions where it associates with a complex that includes PAK , PIX , paxillin , and focal adhesion kinase . 17 Moreover , on EGF stimulation , GIT1 colocalized with ERK1 / 2 in focal adhesions that mediated migration of HeLa cells . 23 However , the mechanisms by which GIT1 regulates lamellipodia for - mation and directional migration are still unknown . Cortactin plays a key role in lamellipodia formation and directional migration . 8 , 9 Our data showed that GIT1 associates with cor - tactin and localizes it to leading edge to promote lamellipo - dia formation and directed cell migration . Depletion of GIT1 remarkably impaired cortactin activation and localization . ERK1 / 2 and Rac1 / Cdc42 are the major signaling pathways responsible for cortactin activation . We found significant decreases of both ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation and Rac1 / Cdc42 activation by loss of GIT1 . In addition , DN - Rac1 / DN - Cdc42 showed greater inhibition on Ser405 cortactin phosphoryla - tion than ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation , which implies the involve - ment of other downstream target of Rac1 / Cdc42 such as PAK on cortactin activation . 26 A significant finding of the present study is that the SHD of GIT1 mediates binding and translocation of cortactin to the leading edge . Most importantly , we identified that GIT1 - SHD is required for cortactin - S405 phosphorylation , which in turn regulates EC migration . Intriguingly , GIT1 and GIT2 are the only mammalian proteins that contain a SHD . The SHD of GIT1 is responsible for regulating src - mediated phospholipase c γ activation , 28 ERK1 / 2 activation in focal adhesions , 29 and the interaction with PIX and PAK com - plex to regulate small GTPase , such as Rac1 and Cdc42 , 17 as well as the regulation of GIT1 binding to focal adhesions . We identified another critical function of GIT1 - SHD , which associates with cortactin to promote cortactin activation and localization to the leading edge during angiogenesis . We also found that GIT1 - mediated localization of cortactin is impor - tant for EC directional migration and angiogenesis in matri - gel plugs and tumor . In recent years , several studies indicated the involvement of GIT1 in cancer including its role in cancer cell migration , 30 cellular transformation , 31 and growth . 19 Our present studies together with previous findings imply that GIT1 overexpres - sion in metastatic tumors could be associated with activation of cortactin , which possibly promote tumor angiogenesis as required during tumor metastasis . Finally , as GIT1 - SHD is unique to GIT1 and GIT1 is highly overexpressed in sev - eral metastatic tumor , 18 , 19 future studies by identifying small molecule inhibitors or peptides to abrogate the functions of GIT1 - SHD could enable us to specifically target GIT1 during metastatic tumor progression .

Recent evidence suggests G - protein – coupled receptor - 2 – interacting protein ( GIT1 ) overexpression in several human metastatic tumors , in - cluding breast , lung , and prostate . Tumor metastasis is associated with increases in angiogenesis . The present study is significant by show - ing that GIT1 is required for tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth via cortactin - dependent directional migration of endothelial cells . There are 3 major mechanisms : ( 1 ) GIT1 increases Rac1 / Cdc42 activation through p21 - associated kinase - interacting exchange factor – p21 - asso - ciated kinase complex to promote cortactin activation and localization to membrane .

( 3 ) GIT1 forms a complex with cortactin to promote cortactin membrane localization and lamellipodia formation . Most importantly , we identified the Spa homology domain of GIT1 as the domain essential for this function . Because the GIT1 - Spa homology domain is unique in the mammalian genome , understanding the structural nature of its interaction with multiple signal mediators may enable specific targeting of individual pathways necessary for angiogenesis .
