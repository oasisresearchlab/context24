In the presence of chromatin bridges , eukary - otic cells delay abscission , the final cut of the narrow cytoplasmic canal that connects the daughter cells , to prevent tetraploidiza - tion by regression of the cleavage furrow or chromatin breakage ( Steigemann et al . , 2009 ; Nähse et al . , 2017 ) . In mammals , this abscission delay is called the abscission checkpoint and relies on the Aurora B protein kinase ( Steigemann et al . , 2009 ; Nähse et al . , 2017 ) . Activated Aurora B phosphorylates the endosomal sorting complex required for transport - III ( ESC RT - III ) subunit charged multivesicular body protein 4C ( Chmp4c ; Capalbo et al . , 2012 ; Carlton et al . , 2012 ; Petsalaki and Zachos , 2016 ) . In turn , phosphorylated Chmp4c can cooperate with several proteins to inhibit the ATPase Vps4 at the midbody and prevent its activity on ESC RT - III filaments in order to inhibit abscission ( Morita et al . , 2007 ; Thoresen et al . , 2014 ; Caballe et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , cells with chromatin bridges form and retain actin - rich struc - tures called actin patches at the base of the chromatin bridge ( Chen and Doxsey , 2009 ; Steigemann et al . , 2009 ) . It is suggested that actin patches stabilize the intercellular canal until the DNA bridge is resolved ; however , how actin patches are formed has not been previously reported . Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in a diverse spectrum of biological activities including cell prolifera - tion , adhesion , spreading , and migration ( Playford and Schaller , 2004 ) . Src is located at the plasma membrane and is also found at late endosomes , the Golgi apparatus , and the nucleus ( Takahashi et al . , 2009 ) . Src family kinases share a conserved domain struc - ture consisting of an amino - terminal membrane - binding SH4 domain with a myristoylation sequence , followed by a “Unique” region that is divergent among family members ( amino acids 20 – 85 of human Src ) , consecutive Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) and SH2 domains , and a kinase domain that is followed by a short C - terminal tail ( Maffei et al . , 2015 ; Roskoski , 2015 ) . The C - ter - minal tail contains an autoinhibitory phosphorylation site ( tyro - sine 530 [ Y530 ] in human Src ) , and phosphorylation at this site promotes assembly of the SH2 , SH3 , and kinase domains into an autoinhibited “closed” conformation ( Xu et al . , 1997 ; Brábek et al . , 2002 ) . Displacement of the SH3 - and SH2 - mediated intra - molecular interactions by Src binding to downstream substrates or higher - affinity ligands allows dephosphorylation of Src - Y530 , followed by autophosphorylation of tyrosine 419 ( Y419 ) © 2018 Dandoulaki et al .

In addition , the Unique domain of Src contains phosphorylation residues that activate Src by promoting dephos - phorylation of the autoinhibitory site ( Shenoy et al . , 1992 ; Stover et al . , 1994 ) or regulate Src binding to lipids ( Pérez et al . , 2013 ; Amata et al . , 2014 ) . Activating mutations in cellular Src or infection with the Src encoding Rous sarcoma virus can cause oncogenic trans - formation that is accompanied by dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton ( Frame , 2002 ) . Src binds to FAK at focal adhe - sions and phosphorylates FAK at various residues including tyrosine 925 ( Y925 ) to activate FAK or create binding sites for adaptor proteins ( Brunton et al . , 2005 ; Mitra et al . , 2005 ) . In turn , the FAK – Src signaling complex promotes changes in actin cytoskeleton and regulates focal adhesion turnover ( Goldberg et al . , 2003 ; Brown et al . , 2005 ; Mitra et al . , 2005 ) . Src phos - phorylates cortactin to enhance actin nucleation and binds to formins to induce formation of stress fibers ( Tominaga et al . , 2000 ; Tehrani et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , Src signaling is involved in the completion of cytokinesis ( Kasahara et al . , 2007a ; Kamranvar et al . , 2016 ) . Chk1 kinase was first identified to regulate the DNA damage response ( Smith et al . , 2010 ) ; however , it is also required for proper mitotic cell division ( Zachos et al . , 2007 ; Peddibhotla et al . , 2009 ) . Chk1 phosphorylates the mitotic kinase Aurora B in prometaphase and metaphase to induce Aurora B catalytic activ - ity and promote correction of misattached kinetochore – micro - tubules ( Petsalaki et al . , 2011 ; Petsalaki and Zachos , 2013 ) . Also , Chk1 is required for successful chromosome segregation and cytokinesis and for an abscission delay in response to replica - tion stress ( Peddibhotla et al . , 2009 ; Petsalaki et al . , 2014 ; Mackay and Ullman , 2015 ) . In this study , we show that Chk1 phosphor - ylates human Src at the newly identified site serine 51 to fully induce Src kinase activity . We also show that phosphorylated Src promotes formation of actin patches and prevents chromosome breakage in cytokinesis with chromatin bridges . Results Src and Chk1 prevent chromatin breakage in cytokinesis Because Src and Chk1 are involved in completion of cytokinesis ( Kasahara et al . , 2007a ; Mackay and Ullman , 2015 ) , we investi - gated their potential role in cytokinesis with chromatin bridges . Confocal microscopy analysis of fixed human colon carcinoma BE cells in telophase showed that 30 – 34 % cells treated with PP2 , a catalytic inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases , or depleted of Chk1 or Src by , respectively , Chk1 siRNA ( siChk1 ) or Src siRNA ( siSrc ) , exhibited broken DNA bridges compared with ∼ 5 % con - trol ( Fig . 1 , A and B ; and Fig . S1 , A and B ) . Treatment with PP2 did not exacerbate chromatin breakage in Chk1 - depleted cells , sug - gesting that Chk1 and Src prevent chromatin breakage by acting through the same mechanism ( Fig . 1 B ) . Also , Chk1 or Src inhi - bition increased the frequency of chromatin bridges that were positive for phospho - Ser139 histone H2A . X ( γ - H2AX ) staining , which is a marker for double - strand DNA breaks ( Fig . 1 , C and D ; Janssen et al . , 2011 ) . To further investigate the role of Chk1 and Src in chroma - tin breakage , HeLa cells expressing the inner nuclear envelope marker LAP2b fused to RFP ( LAP2b - RFP ) and displaying LAP2b - RFP bridges in cytokinesis were monitored for up to 180 min by time - lapse microscopy . LAP2b - RFP localizes around chroma - tin from late anaphase and correlates with chromatin bridges ( Steigemann et al . , 2009 ) . We found that 15 / 15 control cells exhibiting intercellular canals with LAP2b - RFP bridges sus - tained those canals for the duration of the experiment ( Fig . 1 E , Fig . S1 C , and Video 1 ) . In contrast , 11 / 13 cells treated with PP2 exhibited breakage of intercellular canals containing LAP2b - RFP bridges after 47 ± 14 min ( n = 11 ; Fig . 1 E , Fig . S1 C , and Video 2 ) . Furthermore , 11 / 13 cells treated with the selective Chk1 inhib - itor UCN - 01 displaying intercellular canals with LAP2b - RFP bridges exhibited breakage of those canals after 52 ± 15 min ( n = 11 ; Fig . 1 E , Fig . S1 C , and Video 3 ) . Confocal microscopy analysis of fixed HeLa LAP2b - RFP cells also showed that Chk1 - or Src - deficient cells exhibited increased frequency of broken LAP2b - RFP bridges compared with controls ( Fig . 1 , F and G ) . These results suggest that Chk1 and Src prevent chromatin breakage in cytokinesis with chromatin bridges . Fragmented chromatin bridges can lead to the formation of micronuclei and accumulation of DNA damage ( Hoffelder et al . , 2004 ) . Depletion of Src or Chk1 increased the frequency of BE cells exhibiting micronuclei that were devoid of nuclear lamin B2 compared with controls ( Fig . 2 , A and C ) , which is consistent with these micronuclei being bridge - derived ( Utani et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , Src - or Chk1 - deficient cells exhibited increased frequency of micronuclei that were positive for γ - H2AX stain - ing compared with controls ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . These results suggest that Src and Chk1 are required to prevent formation of micronuclei and generation of DNA damage in cytokinesis with chromatin bridges . Src and Chk1 are required for actin patch formation in cytokinesis with chromatin bridges Control cells with chromatin bridges exhibited actin patches , i . e . , regions of relatively high intensity F - actin staining , at both sides of the DNA bridge ( Fig . 2 D ) . However , Src - or Chk1 - deficient cells exhibited reduced actin patches , and this was not a result of diminished total levels of actin compared with controls ( Fig . 2 , D – F ; and Fig . S1 D ) . Control cells with relatively strong or weak DNA bridge labeling ( i . e . , with DNA bridge fluorescence above or below , respectively , the control mean ) exhibited similar actin patches ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . Also , Chk1 - or Src - depleted cells exhib - ited reduced actin patches compared with controls regardless of the intensity of the DNA bridge signal ( relatively strong versus weak signal ; Fig . 3 , A and B ; and Fig . S1 E ) , suggesting that the amount of DNA inside the intercellular canal does not asso - ciate with the intensity of actin patches . Actin patches were also diminished in Src - or Chk1 - deficient cells with intact DNA bridges , suggesting that impaired actin patches were not a con - sequence of chromatin breakage ( Fig . S1 , F – H ) . Expression of WT GFP - Src that is resistant to degradation by a second siSrc ( siSrc - 2 ) , or GFP - Chk1 , resistant to degradation by siChk1 - 2 , reduced chromatin breakage and rescued formation of actin patches after depletion of the endogenous Src or Chk1 compared with Dandoulaki et al .

S1 , I and J ) . These results show that Src and Chk1 are required for stable chromatin bridges and formation of actin patches in cytokinesis . Chromatin breakage in Src - or Chk1 - deficient cells is not caused by abscission Approximately 70 % of Src - or Chk1 - depleted cells with broken DNA bridges exhibited intact intercellular canals as evidenced by staining with FM 1 - 43FX , a fluorescence lipophilic dye that labels membranes ( Fig . 4 , A and B ; Fuenzalida et al . , 2011 ) , sug - gesting that chromatin breakage in Src - or Chk1 - deficient cells does not correlate with abscission . For comparison , 45 / 45 cells treated with the Cdc - like kinase inhibitor TG003 that inhibits the abscission checkpoint ( Petsalaki and Zachos , 2016 ) with broken DNA bridges exhibited broken intercellular canals , indicating that TG003 - treated cells had finished abscission ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Also for comparison , 21 / 21 control cells with intact DNA bridges exhibited intact intercellular canals ( Fig . 4 C ) . To further inves - tigate the mechanism of chromatin breakage , cells expressing mutant Vps4 protein fused to GFP in which Vps4 - lysine 173 was changed to glutamine ( GFP - Vps4 - K173Q ) , to abrogate ATP bind - ing to Vps4 and inhibit abscission ( Morita et al . , 2007 ; Petsalaki and Zachos , 2016 ) , or GFP alone were examined . In cells depleted of Src or Chk1 , expression of GFP – Vps4 - K173Q did not prevent breakage of DNA bridges compared with cells expressing GFP ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) . For comparison , expression of GFP - Vps4 - K173Q prevented chromatin breakage after treatment with TG003 or Aurora B depletion compared with cells expressing GFP only ( Fig . 4 , D and E ; and Fig . S2 A ) , confirming that Vps4 - K173Q inhibits abscission under the experimental conditions used in our study ( Steigemann et al . , 2009 ; Petsalaki and Zachos , 2016 ) . These results show that chromatin breakage in Src - or Chk1 - de - ficient cells is not caused by abscission . Chk1 / Src and Aurora B cooperate to prevent chromatin breakage Aurora B – deficient cells exhibit premature abscission ( Steigemann et al . , 2009 ) , and Aurora B – deficient cells exhib - ited increased frequency of broken chromatin bridges compared with controls despite having similar actin patches ( Fig . 5 , A – C ) . Simultaneous depletion of Chk1 or Src and Aurora B exacerbated chromatin breakage , and this correlated with reduced formation of actin patches and with increased frequency of cells with bro - ken DNA bridges with an intact midbody ( i . e . , without abscis - sion ) compared with cells depleted of Aurora B only ( Fig . 5 , A – D ) . The remaining double - depleted cells with broken DNA bridges exhibited midbody remnants , i . e . , midbodies severed from one daughter cell or completely disassembled midbody microtu - bules ( Fig . 5 A ) . Control cells with intact DNA bridges also exhib - ited disassembled midbody microtubules ( midbody remnants ) despite the abscission delay ( Fig . 5 A ) , in agreement with previ - ous findings ( Steigemann et al . , 2009 ) . The regulatory proteins Plk1 , Mklp1 , and Cep55 localize to the midbody in telophase or late cytokinesis in control cells ( Mishima et al . , 2002 ; Bastos and Barr , 2010 ) , and Chk1 or Src depletion did not impair localiza - tion of the above proteins to the midbody compared with con - trols ( Fig . 5 , E and F ; and Fig . S2 , B – G ) . It was previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of Src resulted in reduced Plk1 and increased Cep55 at the midbody in nontransformed cells ( Kamranvar et al . , 2016 ) . Perhaps the difference between our results and those from Kamranvar et al . ( 2016 ) reflects physi - ological differences between nontransformed and cancer cells . We propose that Chk1 and Src stabilize chromatin bridges by promoting formation of actin patches . These results also suggest that Chk1 and Src cooperate with the Aurora B – mediated abscis - sion checkpoint to prevent chromatin breakage in cytokinesis with DNA bridges . Src and Src - signaling proteins localize to actin patches Proteins involved in actin remodeling can localize to actin struc - tures . We found that the endogenous total Src , autophosphory - lated Src - Y419 ( active Src ) , and transfected WT GFP - Src localized to actin patches in control cells with chromatin bridges ( Figs . 3 D and 6 , A and B ) . Phosphorylated FAK - Y925 ( a phosphorylation substrate of Src ; Brunton et al . , 2005 ) and cortactin ( Tehrani et al . , 2007 ) also localized to actin patches in control cells ( Fig . 6 , C and E ) . These results indicate that actin patch formation is reg - ulated by Src signaling . However , Chk1 was not enriched at actin patches in control cells with chromatin bridges ( Fig . 6 F ) , sug - gesting that Chk1 promotes formation of actin patches without stably localizing at the site . Chk1 is required for optimal Src localization and kinase activity Depletion of Chk1 or , for comparison , treatment with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 impaired localization of total Src and cortactin at the base of the intercellular canal and reduced phosphorylation of Src - Y419 and FAK - Y925 ( which are markers of Src kinase activity ) compared with control cells ( Fig . 6 , A – E ) , suggesting that Chk1 is required for optimal Src localization and kinase activity in cells with chromatin bridges . Chk1 - deficient cells plated on fibronectin - coated dishes exhibited reduced lev - els of autophosphorylated Src - Y419 and phosphorylated FAK - Y925 by 40 – 60 % compared with controls by Western blotting ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . For comparison , Src inhibition by PP2 reduced phosphorylation of Src - Y419 and FAK - Y925 by ∼ 90 % com - pared with controls . However , Src or FAK protein levels per se were not affected by Chk1 depletion or PP2 treatment ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . Furthermore , Chk1 - deficient interphase cells without chromatin bridges exhibited reduced levels of phosphorylated Src - Y419 and phosphorylated FAK - Y925 and diminished local - ization of total Src to membrane ruffles compared with controls ( Fig . S3 , A – E ) . Inhibition of Src kinase activity reduces cell spreading and produces a more round cell morphology ( Elias et al . , 2010 ) . Con - trol or Chk1 - depleted cells were trypsinized , allowed to attach on fibronectin - coated dishes in the absence or presence of PP2 , and observed at various times by phase - contrast time - lapse microscopy . A relatively high percentage of Chk1 - deficient or PP2 - treated cells remained round and highly reflective , indicat - ing that these cells were not able to spread properly , compared with flattened controls ( Fig . 7 , C and D ) . Also , Src kinase activity promotes migration of cells during wound healing ( Di Florio et al . , 2007 ) . Depletion of Chk1 decreased wound closure of a mono - layer of cells compared with controls ( Fig . 7 , E and F ) . Collectively , Dandoulaki et al .

Chk1 phosphorylates Src serine 51 in vitro To investigate whether Chk1 promotes Src kinase activity through phosphorylation , avian Src fused to GST ( GST - avSrc ) was incu - bated with recombinant GST - Chk1 in kinase assays in vitro . In the presence of Chk1 , GST - avSrc was radiolabeled at levels approxi - mately sixfold higher compared with GST - avSrc alone , and this radiolabeling was reduced in the presence of the Chk1 inhibitor UCN - 01 , suggesting it was not a result of Src autophosphorylation ( Figs . S3 F and S4 , A and C ) . After labeling by Chk1 , GST - avSrc was analyzed by liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry , and phosphorylation sites at avSrc - T46 , S48 , or S50 , which were absent in GST - avSrc alone , were identified as Chk1 phosphoryla - tion sites . Only monophosphorylated peptides were observed , and of these three sites , only the avSrc - S48 ( Fig . S4 B ) is conserved in the human protein and corresponds with human Src - S51 . Non - phosphorylatable mutation of S51 to alanine ( S51A ) markedly reduced phosphorylation of human GST - Src ( 1 – 256 ) by Chk1 com - pared with the WT GST - Src ( 1 – 256 ) , showing that Chk1 phosphor - ylates human Src at the novel site S51 in vitro ( Fig . 8 A ) . Serine 51 is inside the Unique domain of Src and conforms to the minimum Chk1 consensus sequence R - x - x - S / T ( Hutchins et al . , 2000 ) . Mul - tiple sequence alignment demonstrated S51 is conserved in Src proteins from different species ( Fig . 8 B ) . Figure 4 .

Src activation by Chk1 prevents chromatin breakage Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201802102 3078 Phosphorylation at S51 promotes Src kinase activity To investigate Src - S51 phosphorylation , an antiphospho – Src - S51 antiserum was raised against the human protein sequence . This antiserum recognized phosphorylated WT GST - Src ( 1 – 256 ) by Chk1 but not the mutant S51A or the unphosphorylated GST - Src ( 1 – 256 ) protein , showing that this reagent is specific for the phosphorylation ( Fig . 8 C ) . Recombinant GST - Chk1 enhanced Src - mediated phosphorylation of FAK - Y925 and autophosphory - lation of Src - Y419 , and this coincided with increased phosphory - lation of Src - S51 by Chk1 in vitro ( Figs . 8 D and S4 D ) . We propose that Chk1 phosphorylates Src - S51 and enhances Src catalytic activity in vitro . Furthermore , WT , S51A , or S51D Src - GFP harboring a phos - phomimetic mutation of S51 to aspartic acid were transfected into cells , and GFP - associated kinase activity was determined by immunoprecipitation - kinase assays by measuring phosphoryla - tion of the FAK - Y925 substrate . GFP – Src - S51A exhibited reduced catalytic activity by ∼ 50 % compared with the WT GFP - Src or GFP – Src - S51D ( Fig . 8 E ) . In comparison , treatment of cells with PP2 almost completely inhibited WT Src - GFP kinase activity as measured by autophosphorylation of Src - Y419 ( Fig . S4 E ) . In addition , immunoprecipitated S51D but not S51A or WT GFP - Src from Chk1 - depleted cells phosphorylated FAK - Y925 to levels similar to WT GFP - Src from Chk1 - proficient cells , showing that GFP – Src - S51D catalytic activity is independent of Chk1 ( Fig . 8 F ) . Together , these results show that S51 phosphorylation is required for complete Src catalytic activity . Phosphorylation at S51 enhances Src catalytic activity in the absence of Y530 phosphorylation One possibility is that S51 phosphorylation enhances Src cat - alytic activity by promoting dephosphorylation of the inhib - itory site Src - Y530 ( Shenoy et al . , 1992 ; Stover et al . , 1994 ) . To investigate this , we generated a mutant GFP – Src - Y530F protein Figure 5 . Chk1 or Src depletion exacer - bates chromatin breakage and reduces actin patches in Aurora B – deficient cells .

Depletion of Src by siRNA diminished phospho - S51 staining compared with control cells ( Fig . 9 B ) . Fur - thermore , phospho - S51 staining was impaired after incubation of the anti – pSrc - S51 antiserum with the phosphorylated pep - tide phospho - S51 compared with the unphosphorylated peptide S51 synthetic peptides ( Fig . S4 F ) , verifying that this reagent is specific for the phosphorylated Src - S51 in immunofluorescence . Phosphorylated Src - S51 also localized to membrane ruffles , filo - podia , and the nucleus and partially colocalized with vinculin at focal adhesions in interphase cells on fibronectin , in the absence of chromatin bridges ( Figs . 9 C and S5 , A and B ) . Depletion of Chk1 diminished Src - S51 phosphorylation compared with con - trol cells in the absence or presence of DNA bridges , showing that S51 phosphorylation is Chk1 - dependent ( Fig . 9 , B – D ) . Chk1 was precipitated from cell extracts using an antibody against the endogenous Src and associated with GST - Src but not with GST in pulldown experiments ( Figs . 9 E and S5 C ) . These results sug - gest that Chk1 associates with Src and phosphorylates Src - S51 in interphase cells . Phosphorylated Src - S51 prevents chromatin breakage In cells depleted of the endogenous Src by siSrc - 2 , expression of the phosphomimetic mutant S51D but not WT GFP - Src resistant to degradation by siSrc - 2 prevented chromatin breakage and res - cued formation of actin patches after Chk1 depletion compared with Chk1 - proficient controls ( Fig . 10 , A and C ) . Furthermore , GFP – Src - S51D localized to actin patches in Chk1 - deficient or con - trol cells ( Fig . 10 A ) . In contrast , expression of the nonphosphor - ylatable mutant Src – GFP - S51A induced chromatin breakage and diminished formation of actin patches in the absence or presence of siChk1 ( Fig . 10 , A – D ) . We propose that Chk1 - mediated Src - S51 phosphorylation is required for actin patch formation and inhi - bition of chromatin breakage in late cytokinesis . Also , expression Figure 7 .

S5 , D and E ) , in agreement with previous studies showing that Src catalytic activity promotes filopodia formation ( Robles et al . , 2005 ; He et al . , 2015 ) . Discussion Control cells with chromatin bridges delay abscission and retain actin patches at the base of the chromatin bridge / intercellular canal ; however , the molecular mechanisms of actin patch for - mation have not been previously reported ( Chen and Doxsey , 2009 ; Steigemann et al . , 2009 ) . In this study , we show that Src , a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in actin remodeling ( Frame , 2002 ; Playford and Schaller , 2004 ) , and Chk1 , a kinase that functions in different stages of the cell cycle ( Zhang and Hunter , 2014 ) , prevent chromosome breakage and are required for formation of actin patches in cytokinesis . Chromatin break - age in Chk1 - or Src - deficient cells is not caused by abscission as evidenced by the majority of cells exhibiting broken chromatin with an intact intercellular canal and also by the inability of a dominant - negative Vps4 - K173Q protein that inhibits abscission to prevent chromatin bridges from breaking ( Morita et al . , 2007 ; Petsalaki and Zachos , 2016 ) . Although a potential function for Chk1 and Src in DNA breakage that is independent of their role in regulating actin patches cannot be formally excluded , our results are consistent with Chk1 and Src preventing DNA bridges from breaking by promoting formation of actin patches . A minority of Chk1 - or Src - deficient cells exhibit both fragmented chromatin bridges and broken intercellular canals ; this could be caused by reduced stability of the intercellular canal in the absence of actin patches or by weakening of the abscission checkpoint after chro - matin breakage , perhaps because of released membrane tension or the broken chromatin being reeled in from the canal ( Lafaurie - Janvore et al . , 2013 ; Nähse et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , Chk1 or Src inhibition exacerbates chromatin breakage in Aurora B – deficient cells with an impaired abscission checkpoint ( Steigemann et al . , 2009 ) , and this correlates with reduced actin patches and with Figure 8 .

We propose that actin patch formation by Chk1 and Src cooperates with the Aurora B – imposed abscission delay to prevent chromatin breakage . These results also suggest that Chk1 and Src are not essential for the abscission delay in response to chromatin bridges . Because Chk1 is required for abscission delay after replication stress , one pos - sibility is that replication stress and chromatin trapped at the intercellular canal can trigger separate signaling pathways that can converge on Aurora B to impose the abscission checkpoint ( Mackay and Ullman , 2015 ; Nähse et al . , 2017 ) . We also show that Chk1 is required for optimal localization and complete activation of Src , efficient cell spreading , and wound healing on fibronectin . Chk1 associates with Src and phosphorylates human Src at the conserved serine 51 inside the Src - Unique region . Phosphorylated Src - S51 localizes to mem - brane ruffles , filopodia , and the nucleus . Also , phosphorylated Src - S51 and Src - signaling proteins such as phosphorylated FAK - Y925 and cortactin localize to actin patches in control cells with chromatin bridges . Mutation of S51 to a nonphosphorylatable alanine residue reduces Src catalytic activity by ∼ 50 % compared with the WT protein , diminishes actin patches , and induces chro - matin breakage . In addition , expression of a phosphomimetic Src - S51D protein rescues formation of actin patches and prevents chromatin breakage in Chk1 - deficient cells . On the basis of these findings , we propose the following model ( Fig . 10 E ) : Chk1 phosphorylates Src at serine 51 , and Figure 9 . Chk1 depletion reduces Src - S51 phosphorylation .

Furthermore , in the presence of chromatin bridges , phosphorylated Src - S51 and Src - signaling proteins promote formation of actin patches and prevent chromosome breakage in cytokinesis . Phosphorylation of serine 51 can promote Src kinase activity independently of Src - Y530 phosphorylation . Structurally , the Y530F mutant of Src remains 85 % in its inactive closed form , and the SH3 domain of Src can down - regulate Src kinase activity in the absence of Y530 phosphorylation through interactions with the kinase N - terminal lobe ( Xu et al . , 1999 ; Brábek et al . , 2002 ; Bernadó et al . , 2008 ) . The Src - SH3 domain also interacts with the Unique domain through a binding region in the opposite side of the SH3 peptide binding site , and the SH3 – Unique domain inter - action is lost after addition of a high - affinity SH3 ligand peptide that induces the active open conformation of the kinase ( Maffei et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , one possibility is that S51 phosphoryla - tion activates Src by destabilizing the interaction between the SH3 and the Unique domain to promote the open conformation . In addition , because S51 is inside the unique domain lipid binding region , S51 phosphorylation may modulate interactions between the Unique domain and lipids to regulate Src localization ( Pérez et al . , 2013 ; Amata et al . , 2014 ) . How do actin patches stabilize chromatin bridges ? The oval or heart shape of many of the nuclei in telophase cells with chromatin bridges suggests that considerable pulling forces are exerted by the chromosomes in the bridge . These forces could cause chromatin breakage by mechanical rupture or induce transient nuclear envelope rupture during interphase , followed by bridge resolution by nuclease activity ( Ganem and Pellman , 2012 ; Maciejowski et al . , 2015 ) . Perhaps , intriguingly , breakage of chromatin bridges in cells proficient for the abscission check - point preferentially occurs next to centromeres at the foot of the Figure 10 .

One possi - bility is that the dense meshwork of highly organized actin fila - ments inside the actin patches provides mechanical support to the nuclear envelope and underlying chromatin by increasing the stiffness and elasticity at the base of the chromatin bridge to counteract the pulling forces applied by the chromosomes in the bridge . Because cross - linkers affect the architecture and mechanical properties of the actin network , identifying how actin filaments are organized and linked together inside the patches may help us understand how such forces are acting ( Fletcher and Mullins , 2010 ) . Phosphorylated FAK - Y925 and cortactin were also detected at actin patches . Focal adhesion proteins are involved in mecha - notransduction and can promote force - dependent actin polym - erization ( Geiger et al . , 2009 ; Houk et al . , 2012 ) . Investigating which Src - signaling proteins are required for actin patch forma - tion in response to DNA bridges may help us better understand how cells stabilize chromatin bridges . In conclusion , our study identifies novel proteins that promote formation of actin patches and protect against chromatin breakage in cytokinesis .

Next , the cells were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in warm ( 37°C ) cytoskeleton buffer for 5 min at room tempera - ture , washed three times with warm ( 37°C ) PBS , and stained with 10 µM TO - PRO - 3 iodide ( Invitrogen ) . Quantification of fluorescence signals Fluorescence intensity signals at midbodies were quantified using the LCS Lite ellipse tool by analyzing an image area of 2 µm 2 around each midbody , and intensity values were normalized ver - sus values obtained by analyzing an identical area within the cell immediately adjacent on the midbody ( Waters , 2009 ; Petsalaki and Zachos , 2016 ) . Actin patch - fluorescence intensity signals were quantified using the LCS Lite polygon tool by analyzing an image area of Dandoulaki et al . Src activation by Chk1 prevents chromatin breakage Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201802102 3086 40 µm 2 around the base of the DNA bridge , and intensity val - ues were normalized versus values obtained by analyzing an identical area within the cell near the base of the DNA bridge ( Waters , 2009 ) . DNA bridge - fluorescence intensity signals were quantified using the LCS Lite polygon tool by analyzing an image area encompassing the entire DNA bridge or intercellular canal , and intensity values were normalized versus values obtained by ana - lyzing an identical area outside the canal . For weak versus strong DNA staining , DNA bridge - fluorescence intensity signals from 40 control bridges were quantified , and the mean value was set to 0 . 5 . DNA bridges exhibiting relative fluorescence intensity > 0 . 5 were taken as strong , whereas those exhibiting relative fluores - cence intensity < 0 . 5 were classified weak DNA signals . Fluorescence intensity signals at membrane ruffles were quantified using the LCS Lite polygon tool by analyzing an image area of 100 µm 2 around the membrane , and intensity values were normalized versus values obtained by analyzing an identi - cal area within the cell immediately adjacent on the membrane ( Waters , 2009 ) . Mass spectrometry GST – avSrc bands were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin , and the extracted tryptic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry as described previ - ously ( Ducommun et al . , 2015 ) . The data were searched against an in - house database containing the avian c - Src sequence using Mascot ( 2 . 4 . 1 ; Matrix Science ) and MaxQuant ( 1 . 3 . 8 . 2 ) . All result files were loaded into Scaffold ( 4 . 8 . 4 ; Proteome Software Inc . ) . Protein thresholds were set to 95 . 0 % with a two unique peptide threshold to report protein identification . Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at > 95 . 0 % probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm ( Keller et al . , 2002 ) , resulting in a peptide false discovery rate of 0 . 76 % . In vitro kinase assays For the in vitro Chk1 kinase assays in Figs . 8 A and S4 A , 0 . 5 µg recombinant GST - Chk1 was incubated with 1 µg GST - Src pro - tein substrate in 20 µl Chk1 kinase buffer ( 20 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM sodium β - glycerophosphate , 1 mM sodium vanadate , 1 mM DTT , 100 µM ATP , and 1 µCi γ - 32 P ATP ) for 20 min at 30°C before analysis by SDS - PAGE .
