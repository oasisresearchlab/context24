Analyzing dendritic cell ( DC ) migration , we showed that these distinct cellular responses depended on the mode of chemokine presentation within tissues . The surface - immobilized form of the chemokine CCL21 , the heparan sulfate - anchoring ligand of the CC - chemokine receptor 7 ( CCR7 ) , caused random movement of DCs that was conﬁned to the chemo - kine - presenting surface because it triggered integ - rin - mediated adhesion . Upon direct contact with CCL21 , DCs truncated the anchoring residues of CCL21 , thereby releasing it from the solid phase . Soluble CCL21 functionally resembles the second CCR7 ligand , CCL19 , which lacks anchoring residues and forms soluble gradients . Both soluble CCR7 ligands triggered chemotactic movement , but not surface adhesion . Adhesive random migration and directional steering cooperate to produce dynamic but spatially restricted locomotion patterns closely resembling the cellular dynamics observed in sec - ondary lymphoid organs . INTRODUCTION Chemokines are central orchestrators of the hematopoietic system . They control leukocyte migration and positioning within tissues and direct recirculation patterns by inducing extra - or intravasation at vascular sites . On the cellular level , two main responses are triggered upon chemokine receptor signaling : ( 1 ) integrin activation that causes adhesion to endothelial surfaces and ( 2 ) polarization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton that causes migration along chemokine gradients ( Rot and von Andrian , 2004 ) . Surface adhesion and migration are traditionally viewed as interdependent phenomena , and in mesenchymal and epithelial cells , the integrin repertoire of a cell restricts its migratory ability to deﬁned tissue environments ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) . Adhesive migration is termed haptokinesis when migra - tion is random or haptotaxis when cells move along concentra - tion gradients of immobilized ligands ( Friedl et al . , 2001 ) . Haptic movement is strictly conﬁned to an adhesive surface or track as the immobilized integrin ligands play dual roles as mechanical anchors and instructive signals . Leukocytes employ fundamen - tally different modes of migration , and recent studies have demonstrated that within three - dimensional ( 3D ) environments such as the interstitium , they can directly convert actomyosin forces into locomotion without utilizing integrin - mediated force coupling . Hence , in leukocytes , adhesion and migration can occur independently ( Friedl et al . , 1998 ; La¨mmermann et al . , 2008 ; Woolf et al . , 2007 ) . We have previously shown that adhesion - independent movement can be triggered by soluble chemokines , resulting in chemokinesis ( random migration ) in response to homogenous chemokine signals or chemotaxis ( directed migration ) when cells migrate along soluble chemokine gradients ( La¨mmermann et al . , 2008 , 2009 ) . As chemokines can induce both integrin activation and polar - ization of the cytoskeleton , the question arises : what determines whether only one or both responses are triggered , i . e . , when does a chemokine induce leukocytes to adhere , migrate , or adhere and migrate ? The best - investigated chemokine effect is the triggering of integrin inside - out signaling , which mediates tight adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium during extravasation from the bloodstream ( Ley et al . , 2007 ) . It is well established that at sites of inﬂammation , chemokines are immobilized to the vascular lumen via cell - anchored sugar residues or scavenger receptors ( Middleton et al . , 1997 ; Pruenster et al . , 2009 ; Rot and von Andrian , 2004 ) . This immobilization appears to be a prerequisite for inducing leukocyte surface adhesion , and there is evidence 703 Konstanzer Online - Publikations - System ( KOPS ) URL : http : / / nbn - resolving . de / urn : nbn : de : bsz : 352 - 0 - 366093 Erschienen in : Immunity ; 32 ( 2010 ) , 5 . - S . 703 - 713 https : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . immuni . 2010 . 04 . 017 that soluble chemokines do not efﬁciently trigger adhesion ( Shamri et al . , 2005 ) . This suggests that the mode of chemokine presentation might determine the cellular response . If and how the presentation form of a chemokine affects leukocyte migra - tion has not beensystematically investigated . It is also not known how chemokines are presented within tissues . In principle , they could form homogenous ﬁelds or spatial gradients and could either be freely diffusible or immobilize to cellular or extracellular surfaces ( Miyasaka and Tanaka , 2004 ) . In this study , we investigate how chemokine presentation within tissues can shape the leukocytes’ chemokinetic , haptoki - netic , chemotactic , and haptotactic responses . As a model system , we use dendritic cells ( DCs ) , antigen - presenting cells that sample the periphery and , upon exposure to infection or inﬂammatory stimuli , migrate into the draining lymph node where they present peripherally acquired antigens to naive T cells ( Alvarez et al . , 2008 ; Mellman and Steinman , 2001 ) . DC migration to the lymph node is entirely dependent on the CC - chemokine receptor 7 ( CCR7 ) , which is upregulated after pathogen contact ( Fo¨rster et al . , 1999 ; Ohl et al . , 2004 ; Sallusto et al . , 1998 ) and recognizes two ligands , CCL19 and CCL21 . CCL21 is expressed on afferent lymphatic vessels and guides DCs into the vessel lumen , while within the lymph node , CCL21 is produced by ﬁbro - blastic reticular cells ( FRCs ) , the stromal cells of the T cell area ( Luther et al . , 2000 ) . FRCs also express CCL19 , albeit in much smaller amounts ( Luther et al . , 2002 ) . Apart from mature DCs , naive T cells and activated B cells express CCR7 , and CCL19 as well as CCL21 are the decisive homeostatic chemokines that direct these cell types into a common compartment of the lymph node where they interact ( Junt et al . , 2004 ; Reif et al . , 2002 ) . Why are there two chemokines for the same receptor ? While equal receptor binding potency suggests redundancy ( Kohout et al . , 2004 ) , both chemokines differ in their ability to bind to heparan sulfate residues . This difference is because of a highly charged 40 amino acid extension at the C terminus of CCL21thatislackinginCCL19 . Ithasbeenshownthatthisregion immobilizes CCL21 while CCL19 is largely soluble ( de Paz et al . , 2007 ; Hirose et al . , 2002 ; Patel et al . , 2001 ) . In vivo , C - terminal truncation of CCL21 prevents its immobilization to the lumen of high endothelial venules and consequently abolishes its ability to trigger lymphocyte extravasation ( Stein et al . , 2000 ) . Here , we show that CCL21 immobilized on FRCs creates a haptokinetic surface for DCs because it triggers both integ - rin - dependent adhesion and motility . We show that haptokinesis on immobilized CCL21 can be directionally biased by gradients of soluble CCL21 or CCL19 , which alone trigger directed migra - tion , but not adhesion . This principle combines the robustness of a haptokinetic surface with the ﬂexibility of a chemotactic gradient . The result is locally adjustable leukocyte swarming within conﬁned areas as it is found in lymphatic organs . RESULTS A Reductionist In Vitro System to Study Chemokine - Driven DC Migration The abundant chemokine in the T cell area of lymph nodes is CCL21 as detected by immunohistology on cryosections ( Luther et al . , 2000 ; Woolf et al . , 2007 ) . As mature DCs migrate vigor - ously in response to CCR7 ligands , we tested whether DCs could be employed as environmental sensors of chemokine distribu - tion on cryosections . We layered mature bone marrow - derived DCs on unﬁxed cryosections of inguinal mouse lymph nodes and followed their behavior by time - lapse video microscopy . In this setup , the cells showed a highly synchronized wave of directed migration from the periphery toward the inner part of the lymph node section ( Figures 1A – 1C ; Movie S1 available online ) . Twelve to eighteen hours after the onset of migration , DCs accumulated in the center of the lymph node . Migration was observed only when mature DCs were employed and not immature DCs ( Figure 1B ) or other cell types , including macro - phages , mast cells , B cells , and T cells ( data not shown ) . As migratory activity was restricted to deﬁned areas , we tested whether these areas represented the physiological entry routes and combined in vivo and in vitro migration assays to address this issue . Mice were injected subcutaneously with ﬂuorescently labeled mature DCs , and draining lymph nodes were excised after 10 hr . Costaining of the stromal backbone showed that the transferred DCs located to the interfollicular areas ( Figure 1D , left panel ) . Consecutive sections were then used as substrates for in vitro assays . Single - cell tracking of DCs revealed migrating cells in areas that also contained the DCs that had migrated in vivo ( Figure 1D , right panel ) . Response Patterns to CCL21 To deﬁne the extracellular signals directing the cells , we employed mature Ccr7 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DCs in the cryosection assays and found no accumulation in the center of the section ( Figure 2A ) . Similarly , mature wild - type ( WT ) DCs did not accumulate on lymph node sections obtained from plt / plt mice , which lack expression of both CCR7 ligands ( Nakano et al . , 1998 ) , while plt / plt DCs accumulated on WT sections ( Figure 2A ) . These ﬁndings suggest that CCR7 present on the DCs and CCR7 ligands present on the sections are essential for DC migration on lymph node sections . We conclude that DC migration on cry - osections recapitulates the physiological process , while complex intercellular crosstalks are largely excluded as the section is not alive . A simple explanation for the directional movement of the DCs was migration along a graded distribution of CCR7 ligand that is immobilized on the section . In order to visualize immobilized gradients , we immunostained for CCL21 and CCL19 . In accor - dance with previous studies ( Luther et al . , 2000 ) , CCL19 was not detectable with our histological techniques , while CCL21 signal decorated the reticular network of the T cell parenchyma and left B cell follicles unstained ( Figure 2B ) . Consistent with a previous report ( Okada and Cyster , 2007 ) , the gross staining pattern suggested concentration of CCL21 in the center of the lymph node . To investigate the possibility of DC migration along an immobilized CCL21 gradient , a peripheral portion of a lymph node cryosection was removed and repositioned at 180 (cid:3) to the remaining tissue section ( Figure 2C , left panel ) . Here , DCs showed a wave of directed migration , with migration on the inverted tissue segment still being directed toward the center of the larger segment ( Figure 2C , right panel ; Movie S2 ) . Migra - tion ceased at the margin of the section as DCs migrate poorly on glass surfaces . Hence , on the inverted segment , the migration direction had changed relative to the tissue substrate . These 704 results disprove migration along an immobilized gradient and suggest the involvement of a soluble gradient , originating from the T cell area . To reduce the complexity of our assays , we next investigated migration in response to immobilized CCL21 . DCs were followed by video microscopy while being exposed to a cell culture poly - styrene surface decorated with a spot of immobilized CCL21 . DCs directly settling onto the coated area showed rapid spreading , followed by random migration . Five to ten minutes after the onset of migration , DCs outside the coated area started to move directionally toward the chemokine spot , while Ccr7 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DCs were unresponsive ( Figures 3A – 3C ; Movie S3 ) . These observations suggest that immobilized CCL21 has three effects on mature DCs : ( 1 ) it triggers rapid spreading , ( 2 ) it triggers random migration , and ( 3 ) it triggers the release of a soluble factor that attracts more DCs . We continued to dissect these individual responses in a reductionist manner . DCs Turn Immobilized CCL21 into Soluble CCL21 that Resembles CCL19 We ﬁrst addressed the nature of the soluble attractant that is produced once DCs contact CCL21 . In order to physically separate the site where soluble attractant is produced from the responding cells , we performed underagarose chemotaxis assays . Here , cells and attractant are placed in distant holes of an agarose layer , which allows diffusion of solutes while the cells can migrate between agarose and substrate along soluble gradients ( Heit and Kubes , 2003 ) . In this setup , CCL21 triggered a minimal chemotactic response in mature DCs , while they migrated vigorously ( and directionally ) toward a mixture of CCL21 and DCs . DCs alone did not attract other DCs . This demonstrated the induction of a soluble chemotactic gradient once DCs contacted CCL21 . This chemotactic response was comparable to DCs migrating toward CCL19 ( Figure 4A ) . Migration toward the mixture of CCL21 and DCs was blocked when the responder DCs were preincubated with pertussis toxin . Moreover , Ccr7 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DCs were unresponsive ( Figure 4A ) , suggest - ing that either an unknown CCR7 ligand , CCL19 or an altered form of CCL21 was released upon contact of CCL21 with DCs . As plt / plt DCs plus CCL21 and WT DCs plus CCL21 ( in the absence or presence of BrefeldinA to inhibit golgi export , data not shown ) triggered comparable chemotaxis ( Figure 4A ) , the induced release of CCL19 or other proteins was excluded . We conclude that the chemotactic cue was most likely a modiﬁed variant of CCL21 itself that is produced upon direct contact between DCs and CCL21 . To test for possible modiﬁcations of CCL21 , we performed immunoblot analysis of CCL21 before and after incubation with Figure 1 .

A CCL21 fragment of approximately 8 kDa size appeared with increasing incubation times ( Figure 4B ) , but no comparable response was seen upon incubation with naive T cells , B cells , or ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 4C ) . We found a comparable CCL21 fragment when we immunoprecipitated CCL21 from lymph node lysates ( Figure 4D ) , demonstrating the potential in vivo relevance of our ﬁndings . Processing was completely blocked by the serine protease inhibitor Aprotinin ( Figure 4E ) , but not by a wide range of other protease inhibitors ( data not shown ) . Accordingly , the supernatant of WT DCs plus CCL21 lost its chemotactic activity in under agarose assays when Aprotinin was present ( Figure 4A ) . To map the site of cleavage , we incubated recombinant CCL21 carrying an N - terminal Flag - tag and a C - terminal His - tag with DCs . Loss of His - tag , but not Flag - tag , immunoreactivity demon - strated cleavage of the C terminus ( Figure 4F ) . Together , these ﬁndings demonstrate that upon direct contact with mature DCs , CCL21 is processed into a variant that lacks the heparan sulfate binding residues and is able to diffuse and act chemotac - tically . Cleaved CCL21 resembles native CCL19 , which is neither proteolytically processed nor gains chemotactic activity upon exposure to DCs ( data not shown ) . Accordingly , recombinant truncated CCL21 that lacked the C terminus induced strong chemotaxis ( Figure 4A ) . Immobilized , but Not Soluble , Chemokine Triggers Integrins on DCs Morphology of migratory DCs on lymph node sections and on immobilized CCL21 suggested that adhesion is a critical factor for DC migration on the sections : migratory DCs were ﬂattened and polarized , while nonmigrating DCs were rounded and dendritic ( Figure 5A ; Movie S4 ) . This prompted us to test whether integrins are involved in the migration process . In contrast to negative results with all other integrin family members ( data not shown ) , DCs generated from Itgb2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice neither spread on the interfollicular areas nor accumulated in the center of sections ( Figure 5B ; Movie S5 ) . We conclude that DC migration on lymph node cryosections is mediated by b 2 integrin dependent adhe - sion . Similarly , Ccr7 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DCs were not only unable to perform Figure 2 .

Migration is directed toward the CCL21 coated area ( arrow ) and is observed in uncoated areas up to 1 mm from the coated area . 706 directed migration but also remained rounded on cryosections ( data not shown ) . This suggested that adhesiveness and chemo - kine sensing were functionally linked and led us to investigate the crosstalk between CCR7 and integrins on DCs . One potential b 2 integrin ligand on the sections is ICAM - 1 , which is abundantly expressed in the T cell area ( Figure 2B ) . WT DCs were monitored upon settling on surfaces coated with a mixture of CCL21 and ICAM - 1 . The cells showed rapid spreading within minutes after contact with CCL21 plus ICAM - 1 ( Figure 5C ) , while ICAM - 1 alone did not trigger spreading , indicating a quiescent state of the ICAM - 1 binding b 2 integrins on mature DCs . When DCs were plated onto surfaces coated with both CCL19 and ICAM - 1 , only weak spreading was observed ( Figure 5C ) . The same pattern emerged when both chemokines were bound to surfaces that were precoated with polysialic acid , a physiological substrate for CCL21 binding ( Bax et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure S1A ) . Importantly , soluble CCL21 and CCL19 applied in concentra - tions that exceeded the amounts needed to trigger chemotactic migration did not induce any spreading response ( Figure 5D ) . The lack of spreading on CCL19 could either be due to differen - tial signaling properties or inefﬁcient immobilization of CCL19 because it lacks a charged C terminus . We therefore plated the chemokines on surfaces pretreated to enhance protein - loading capacity . In this setup , where comparable amounts of CCL21 and CCL19 were immobilized ( Figure S1B ) , CCL19 induced substantial spreading ( Figure 5E ) . When Itgb2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) and Ccr7 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DCs were plated on the same cocoated surfaces , no spreading was observed ( Figure 5E ) . These ﬁndings indicate that the interaction between CCR7 and immobilized , but not soluble , CCR7 ligand induces integrin - dependent spreading , polarization , and migration of DCs ( Figure 5F ) . Directional Steering of Haptokinetic Movement The cryosection assays suggested that haptic migration on a track functionalized with CCL21 can be steered by a soluble gradient of CCR7 ligand . To directly test this in a controlled experimental setup , we established a variant of 3D collagen gel chemotaxis assays . Consistent with our above observation Figure 4 .

To mimic chemokinetic inter - faces , we incorporated carbon microﬁbers ( 5 m m diameter ) that were previously cocoated with ICAM - 1 and CCL21 into the gels . Once in contact with the ﬁbers , DCs adhered to the surface and moved up and down frequently switching direction - ality , while uncoated ﬁbers were ignored ( Figures 6A and 6B ; Figure 6 .

Itgb2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DCs did not associate with the coated ﬁbers ( Figure 6C ) . To test if the haptokinetic cells on the ﬁbers were still responsive to directional stimuli , we introduced soluble gradients of either CCL19 or truncated CCL21 into the gel . As shown previously , this caused directionally persistent chemotactic migration of the non - ﬁber - associated DCs . Importantly , the soluble gradient directionally biased the DCs on the ﬁbers : once cells con - tacted a ﬁber , they preferred to follow its surface even if they were distracted from the direct path ( Figures 6E and 6F and Movies S8 and S9 ) . With increasing concentrations of soluble CCL19 , less DCs remained on the ﬁbers , suggesting that chemotactic and adhesive signals compete ( Figure 6D ) . Fibers coated with ICAM - 1 alone were ignored by the DCs , conﬁrming our previous results that soluble CCR7 ligand does not trigger adhesion . Accordingly , when Itgb2 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DCs were employed in the assays , they showed no interaction with CCL21 plus ICAM - 1 cofunctionalized ﬁbers but moved with normal speed and directionality within the gels ( Figure 6G ; Movie S10 ) , as expected from our previous studies ( La¨mmermann et al . , 2008 ) . 709 These results demonstrate that DCs respond to immobilized CCL21 ﬁelds haptokinetically while simultaneously sensing a soluble gradient of CCR7 ligand that introduces a directional bias . DISCUSSION We have shown that in mature DCs , surface - immobilized CCL21 induces both inside - out activation of b 2 integrins and cytoskel - etal polarization , which results in haptokinetic movement . CCL19 , which does not immobilize to surfaces because it lacks a heparan sulfate binding C terminus , does not induce adhesion but does polarize the cytoskeleton and therefore causes chemotactic movement . When both immobilized and soluble chemokines were offered , DCs showed a combined response and performed directionally biased haptokinetic migration . By proteolytically truncating the heparan sulfate binding residue and thereby generating a soluble form of CCL21 , DCs generated a self - perpetuating wave of collective migration where immobi - lized CCL21 dictated the pathway and either solubilized CCL21 or CCL19 the direction of migration . We demonstrated this principle using reductionist in vitro setups . However , the combination of haptokinesis and chemo - taxis potentially explains many phenomena that have been observed in vivo , and the principle might apply to lymphocytes as well as DCs . Using intravital or tissue - slice microscopy , it was shown that both blocking of G a i protein - coupled chemokine receptors or the deletion of CCR7 impaired the movement of naive T cells and mature DCs in the lymph node ( Asperti - Boursin et al . , 2007 ; Okada and Cyster , 2007 ; Worbs et al . , 2007 ) . Hence , chemokine signals are essential for both triggering and maintain - ing an optimal motile state . Recent intravital microscopy studies provided an extension to this view and demonstrated that the three - dimensional scaffolds of T cell area FRCs and the B cell area follicular dendritic cells represent the tracks along which T and B cells migrate , respectively ( Baje´noff et al . , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ; Roozendaal et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , migration on the tracks lacked any directional bias , resulting in ‘‘guided random - ness’’ ( Mempel et al . , 2006 ) , a swarming locomotion pattern within strictly segregated compartments . Mechanistically , it was suggested that CCL21 that is produced by and immobilized on the FRC surface might form a ﬁeld that keeps the cells motile ( Baje´noff et al . , 2006 ) . The same was suggested for CXCL13 on B cell follicle stroma cells ( Roozendaal et al . , 2009 ) . However , a kinetic stroma - scaffold alone does not sufﬁciently explain such behavior . The scaffold additionally has to be adhesive , otherwise the cells would lose surface contact and would ‘‘fall off the tracks . ’’ The haptokinetic migration mode we describe here perfectly explains the above in vivo ﬁndings . The haptokinetic scaffold is conceptually appealing as an immobilized and therefore static chemokine ﬁeld and is poten - tially robust against the convective forces , turbulences , and mechanical perturbations in vivo . While this principle explains homeostatic swarming , it also has limitations : it lacks any direc - tional information and does not allow for local regulation . Most importantly , it does not explain the following phenomena that have been described in vivo : ( 1 ) After penetrating the ﬂoor of the subcapsular sinus , DCs migrate directionally around the B cell follicles into the deeper T cell regions ( La¨mmermann et al . , 2008 ; Sumen et al . , 2004 ) . ( 2 ) Upon activation , B cells upre - gulate CCR7 and move directionally toward the interface between T and B area , and the experimental introduction of CCR7 into naive B cells has the same effect ( Okada et al . , 2005 ; Reif et al . , 2002 ) . ( 3 ) Upon lymph node entry , epidermis - derived DCs that only express CCR7 settle in the deep T cell area ( Kis - senpfennig et al . , 2005 ; Saeki et al . , 2000 ; Wu and Hwang , 2002 ) , while dermis - derived DCs that express both CCR7 and CXCR5 ( Saeki et al . , 2000 ) move to areas closer to the B cell folli - cles . These and other in vivo reports of directional migration within lymphatic organs ( Castellino et al . , 2006 ; Chtanova et al . , 2008 ; Okada et al . , 2005 ) , together with in vitro ﬁndings that T cells , B cells , and DCs are all capable to migrate toward spatial chemokine gradients ( Worbs et al . , 2007 ; La¨mmermann et al . , 2008 , 2009 ) , strongly argue for the presence of graded distribu - tions of chemokines within lymphatic organs that serve not only as motility triggers but also as long - range directional cues . The directionally biased haptokinesis that we describe here resolves the dilemma between the kinetic and the tactic model as it combines the robustness of haptokinesis with the ﬂexibility of chemotaxis . It also harbors many regulatory possibilities that we did not directly address in our reductionist approach . Physi - ological phenomena such as blurred borders between T and B cell area during inﬂammatory responses ( Okada et al . , 2005 ) might well be caused by shifting the balance between soluble and bound CCR7 ligand as in the example caused by the proteo - lytic shedding of CCL21 that we describe . In this context it is interesting that the chemotactic ‘‘pull’’ of a soluble gradient counteracts adhesion to the immobilized chemokine and vice - versa . This means that either steep soluble gradients or sparse CCL21 and integrin - ligand coating of the FRCs might , depending on the chemokine receptor expression level of the responding cell , individually inﬂuence intranodal positioning and also dwell times of cell populations within the lymph node . It was shown that stroma cells of reactive lymph nodes downregulate the transcription of homeostatic chemokines , leading to reduced T cell priming during secondary immunizations ( Mueller et al . , 2007 ) . Shedding of CCL21 might act similarly , even before such transcriptional responses occur , and possibly causes local micromilieus within the reactive lymph node . Solubilization of chemokines might further support collective movement patterns as they have been described for DCs : here , migrating cells locally recruit more cells into the lymph node , a phenomenon that has been described as lymph node conditioning ( Martı´n - Fontecha et al . , 2003 ) . From a cell biological perspective , kinesis is the product of either spontaneous or externally triggered self - polarization . Self - polarization does not rely on asymmetrical external cues and thereby causes cytoskeletal rearrangements and migration in a random direction ( Andrew and Insall , 2007 ; Wedlich - Soldner and Li , 2003 ) . Recently , it has been proposed that self - polariza - tion and directed migration might be more closely connected than previously considered . Arrieumerlou et al . proposed a model that describes directed movement as a phenomenon that is superimposed on self - polarization . Here , every chemo - kine - triggered signaling event that occurs within one of many leading edge protrusions of a self - polarized cell leads to local re - enforcement of the protrusion . Consequently , an initially random migrating cell gradually turns toward the source of 710 the chemotactic cue and thereby performs a ‘‘directionally biased random walk’’ that shows increasing directional persis - tence with increasing steepness of the gradient ( Arrieumerlou and Meyer , 2005 ) . The directionally steered haptokinesis we observed in the present study can be viewed as an extension of this model , where immobilized CCL21 triggers adhesion as well as random polarization and migration , while soluble chemo - kine gradients introduce a directional bias ( see schematic in Figure S2 ) . Apart from offering a cell biological explanation for observed phenomena of intranodal leukocyte migration , our ﬁndings might be of more general relevance . We have recently shown that leukocytes are able to migrate with identical velocities in the adhesive and nonadhesive mode because they efﬁciently adapt their cytoskeletal dynamics ( Renkawitz et al . , 2009 ) . Although this means that integrins are not essential for actual movement , they can shape the migratory pathway and also mediate close contact with surfaces while the cell moves . This makes physio - logical sense because diffusive distribution of soluble cues is largely unaffected by extracellular matrix components . Cells that are nonadherent can directly follow these cues without being ‘‘distracted’’ by the local cellular or extracellular infrastruc - ture . Only once it is decorated with an immobilized chemokine that activates integrin - mediated anchoring , the infrastructure becomes adhesive and therefore affects the behavior of the cell . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Reagents Chemokines : recombinant murine CCL19 and CCL21 and murine ICAM 1 humanFc fusion protein were purchased from R & D Systems . For immunoﬂuo rescence polyclonal rabbit anti mouse laminin 111 ( Sixt et al . , 2005 ) , rabbit anti mouse Exodus 2 ( PeproTech ) monoclonal hamster anti ICAM 1 ( Phar Mingen ) were used . Primary antibodies were detected using FITC or Cy3 conjugated goat anti rat or goat anti rabbit IgG ( Dianova ) . Primary antibodies employedforimmunoblotanalysiswereasfollows : rabbitanti mouseExodus 2 ( PeproTech ) , mouse anti His Tag ( Novagen ) , and anti Flag M2 Peroxidase ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Anti rabbit horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) and anti mouse HRP ( both Biorad ) were used as secondaries . Mice Itgb2 / ( Wilson et al . , 1993 ) , Ccr7 / ( Fo¨rster et al . , 1999 ) , and plt / plt mice ( Nakano et al . , 1998 ) were kept on a C57BL / 6 background and bred in a conventional animal facility according to the local regulations . Generation of Bone Marrow - Derived DC DCs were generated from ﬂushed bone marrow as described previously ( Lutz et al . , 1999 ) . Maturation was induced overnight with 200 ng / ml LPS ( Sigma Aldrich ; E . coli ; 0127 : B8 ) on days 9 11 of culture . All experiments with DCs were performed in R10 medium ( RPMI supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum [ FCS ] [ both Invitrogen ; FCS heat inactivated for 20 min at 57 (cid:3) C ] , peni cillin streptomycin , and glutamine [ PAA ] ) . Immunoﬂuorescence Microscopy Cryostat sections ( 8 m m ) were ﬁxed in methanol at 20 (cid:3) for 10 min , blocked with1 % BSA , andsubjectedtostandardimmunoﬂuorescence stainingproce dures . Stained sections were examined using either a Zeiss Axiophot ﬂuores cence microscope and documented with the Openlab software version 3 . 1 . 2 ( Improvision ) or an inverted confocal microscope ( Leica , SP2 ) . In Vivo Migration of DCs Mature DCs were labeled with 5 m M 5 , 6 carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succi niminidyl ester ( CFSE ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations ( Molecular Probes ) . After labeling and extensive washing in phosphate buff ered saline ( PBS ) , 5 3 10 5 DCs in a volume of 20 m l PBS were injected into the hind footpads . Draining lymph nodes were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen . Production of Recombinant Chemokines Tagged recombinant CCL21 was produced using the Pichia pastoris yeast expressionsystem ( Invitrogen ) . ThecodingsequenceofmatureCCL21 ( amino acids 24 133 ) was PCR ampliﬁed from pET52 CCL21 ( forward : 5 0 ACG TAG AAT TCC GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG AGT GAT GGA GGG GGT CAG GAC 3 0 ; reverse : 5 0 TAC GTA TCT AGA GG TCC TCT TGA GGG CTG TGT CTG 3 0 ) . The product was cloned into pPICZ a C ( Invitrogen ) , and the plasmid linearized with ScaI ( NEB ) and transfected into P . pastoris SMD1168H ( Invitrogen ) . CCL21 was puriﬁed from the yeast culture superna tant using NTA agarose ( RAQ007 . 2 , QIAGEN ) . Full length and C terminally truncated CCL21 ( amino acids 24 98 ) were PCR ampliﬁed introducing a stop codon ( forward : full length and truncated mCCL21 : 5 0 CAAGGTCTCAGGTGGTAGTGATGGAGGGGGTCAG ; reverse : full length , 5 0 CAGCTCGAGTCATCCTCTTGAGGGCTGTGTCTG ; truncated , 5 0 AATCTCGAGTCATTTCCCTGGGGCTGGAGG ) . PCR fragments were cloned into pET 6his SUMO 1 . Transformed E . coli B834 ( DE3 ) pLysS ( Nova gen ) were disrupted ( Constant Systems Ltd . ) , supernatants were loaded on a HisTrap HP column ( GE Healthcare ) , and bound proteins were eluted with PBS containing 500 mM imidazole using an AKTA Explorer chromatography system ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Eluted fractions were digested with a C terminal his tagged Ubl speciﬁc protease 1 ( ULP1 ) at 4 (cid:3) C followed by puriﬁcation of cleaved chemokines in a Zn 2 + charged HiTrap IMAC FF column ( GE Healthcare ) and optional gel ﬁltration ( HiPrep Sephacryl S 200 , GE Healthcare ) . Analysis of Chemokine Cleavage 150ng of untagged CCL21 ( R & D Systems ) or 75ng taggedCCL21 ( expressed in P . pastoris ) were incubated with 6 3 10 5 DCs in 100 m l R10 medium for 4 12hrat37 (cid:3) C , 5 % CO 2 . Theproteinsinthecellsupernatantswereseparated by SDS PAGE on 15 % Tris lysine gels and blotted on PVDF membrane ( Immobilon , 0 . 2 m m , Millipore ) .
