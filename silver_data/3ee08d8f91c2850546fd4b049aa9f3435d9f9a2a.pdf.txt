In the nervous system , chemokines participate both in physiological and pathological processes , and while their expression is often described on glial and immune cells , growing evidence describes the expression of chemokines and their receptors in neurons , highlighting their potential in auto - and paracrine signalling . In this study we analysed the role of nociception in the neuronal chemokinome , and in turn their role in axonal growth . We found that stimulating TRPV1 + nociceptors induces a transient increase in CCL21 . Interestingly we also found that CCL21 enhances neurite growth of large diameter proprioceptors in vitro . Consistent with this , we show that proprioceptors express the CCL21 receptor CCR7 , and a CCR7 neutralizing antibody dose - dependently attenuates CCL21 - induced neurite outgrowth . Mechanistically , we found that CCL21 binds locally to its receptor CCR7 at the growth cone , activating the downstream MEK - ERK pathway , that in turn activates N - WASP , triggering actin ﬁ lament rami ﬁ cation in the growth cone , resulting in increased axonal growth . Keywords : CCL21 , CCR7 , MEK - ERK , axonal growth , nociception INTRODUCTION Classically , chemokines have been associated with leukocyte migration ( 1 ) . Nevertheless , growing evidence shows that they can signal to a great variety of cell types and tissues , including neural cells ( 2 , 3 ) . In addition , as conventional chemokine receptors are G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , chemokines can initiate a broad variety of intracellular signaling pathways ( 1 ) . Several studies have demonstrated the presence and the importance of chemokines in the nervous system ( 2 , 4 , 5 ) . For instance , CXCL12 plays a vital role in regulating neuronal migration during cortical development ( 6 , 7 ) . Remarkably , different studies show both chemokines and their receptors expressed in neurons , suggesting an implication of these components in direct neuronal communication ( 5 , 8 ) . In homeostasis , neuronal CX 3 CL1 interacts with microglia preventing its activation ( 9 ) . Additionally , neuronal chemokines have emerged as fundamental signals after insult . For instance , CCL2 or CCL21 ( 10 – 13 ) , are secreted upon neuronal injury and serve as chemoattractants of immune cells , triggering their activation . This activation , however , often leads to neuropathic pain ( 11 – 13 ) .

Front . Immunol . 13 : 880647 . doi : 10 . 3389 / fimmu . 2022 . 880647 ORIGINAL RESEARCH published : 14 July 2022 doi : 10 . 3389 / fimmu . 2022 . 880647 chemokines , such as CCL2 after peripheral injury , have been also described to promote axonal regeneration as a result of macrophage recruitment and phenotype modulation ( 10 , 14 ) . Meanwhile , although several chemokine receptors are expressed in different neuronal types ( 8 , 9 ) , little is known about their functions as autocrine or paracrine messengers on other neurons . Neurons alter their secretome when exposed to different stimuli and according to their physiological state . In that direction , neuronal activity has been shown to modulate neuronal communication , including with microglia or with other neurons beyond classical neurotransmission ( 15 – 17 ) . Nociceptor activity after axonal injury is normally associated with pathological neuropathic pain ( 18 ) , despite that , some studies uncover how nociception participates in the healing process , such as promoting skin or adipose tissue regeneration , as well as neovascularization ( 19 – 21 ) . These ﬁ ndings indicate that nociception might function as a key component of the healing machinery , and it is therefore important to study its precise roles in healing and regeneration in different tissues , including the nervous system . In that sense , injured nociceptors have been described to release CCL21 , however , whether this expression affected axonal regeneration has not been previously assessed ( 13 ) . CCL21 has a primordial role in immune cell homing , via its canonical receptor CCR7 ( 22 ) , but other functions for this chemokine in distinct tissues are also emerging , such as cartilage regeneration ( 23 ) and neuropathic pain induction in the CNS ( 13 ) . Interestingly , in accordance with its function as a migration cue , the CCL21 - CCR7 interaction activates intracellular pathways related to chemotaxis , via ERK signaling , this includes actin cytoskeleton remodeling via RhoA ( 24 ) . Since cellular migration and growth cone dynamics are analogous mechanisms ( 25 , 26 ) , we hypothesized that CCL21 could exert a growth promoting effect on neurons . In the present study , we investigated the impact of nociceptor activation in the neuronal chemokinome which led us to ﬁ nd an undescribed mechanism of neuronal communication between two different neuronal types , nociceptors and proprioceptors . Speci ﬁ cally , we found that activation of TRPV1 + nociceptors induces an increase in CCL21 expression . Moreover , we revealed a novel role for this CCL21 in proprioceptors , promoting neurite outgrowth . We then found that the receptor CCR7 , expressed in proprioceptors , was required for this effect , which was also dependent on the MEK - ERK pathway . Finally , our results disclose a local mechanism in the growth cone , where CCR7 expression is concentrated , affecting the actin cytoskeleton , ultimately leading to enhanced neurite outgrowth . MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice B6 . Cg - Tg ( Thy1 - COP4 / EYFP ) 18Gfng / J ( Thy1 - ChR2 ) ( 27 ) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and C57BL / 6J mice from Charles River Laboratories . PV - Cre / Ai27D / CSP - Flox mice ( # 008069 and # 012567 ( Jackson Laboratories ) crossbreeding ) were provided by Dr . Rafael Ferna ́ ndez Chaco ́ n ( Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla , Spain ) . Mice ranging from 6 - 10 weeks were used . All animal work was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation ( CEEA ) of the University of Barcelona ( procedures # 276 / 16 , 47 / 20 , and OB41 / 21 ) .

In Vitro Optogenetic Stimulation Thy1 - ChR2 DRG neurons were used for in vitro optogenetic stimulation . A 470nm emission LED array ( LuxeonRebelTM ) under the control of a Driver LED ( FemtoBuck , SparkFun ) of 600mA and a pulse generator PulsePal ( 28 ) were used to deliver blue light to neuronal cultures . The optogenetic stimulation protocol consisted in 1h of illumination at 10Hz of frequency with 10ms - 90ms pulses , in 1s ON - 4s OFF periods . Stimulation was applied 2h after seeding . Chemokinome Quanti ﬁ cation A Mouse Chemokine Array C1 ( RayBiotech ) was used to determine the expression levels of 25 different chemokines in the media of cultured optogenetically stimulated and non - stimulated DRGs . The media was recovered 24h after the stimulation and processed as indicated by the manufacturer . Quanti ﬁ catrion was performed by densitometry using Gilles Carpentier ' s Dot - Blot - Analyzer macro [ written by Gilles Carpentier , 2008 ( 29 ) ] .

The intensity measurements of the different chemokines were normalized to a reference spot and to the non - stimulated samples . Capsaicin Administration Intraplantar ( i . pl . ) injection of capsaicin ( 10 m l of 100 m g / ml in PBS + 10 % ethanol ) was performed 2h before animal sacri ﬁ ce and DRG dissection . Dorsal Root Ganglia Neuronal Culture DRGs were dissected , collected in ice - cold Hank ’ s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and transferred to a digestion solution [ 5mg / ml Dispase II ( Merck ) and 2 . 5mg / ml Collagenase Type II ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) in DMEM ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) ] incubated for 45min at 37°C . DRGs were then centrifuged , and digestion solution was then exchanged for DMEM : F12 ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) media supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated FBS and 1x B27 ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , the DRGs were then dissociated by pipetting . The resulting cell suspension was then spun down , resuspended in culture media ( DMEM : F - 12 media supplemented with 1x B27 and penicillin / streptomycin ( P / S ) ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) ) and seeded in 48 - well plates ( 3000 - 4000 cells / well ) previously coated with 0 . 1mg / ml poly - D - lysine ( 2h , 37°C ; Merck ) and 2 m g / ml laminin ( over - night ( O / N ) , RT Mesquida - Veny et al .

Cells were kept at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Compounds were added 2h after plating , unless in combinatorial experiments , when blocking antibodies or pharmacological inhibitors were added at 1 , 5h and 50nM of CCL21 30 min later . All compounds were left in the media for the whole duration of the experiment . Cells were ﬁ xed 24h after the treatment . Local Administration to the Sciatic Nerve Mice were anaesthetized with inhaled iso ﬂ uorane ( 4 % induction , 2 % maintenance ) . The sciatic nerve was hooked and immobilized after skin incision and blunt dissection of the gluteus maximus and the biceps femoralis . Compounds were locally injected into the nerve and the incision was closed by layer . Animals were then allowed to recover for 24h . Ex Vivo DRG Culture 2h after capsaicin i . pl . administration or 24h after local administration of CCL21 to the sciatic nerve respectively , sciatic DRGs ( L4 , L5 , L6 ) were dissected and processed for cell culture as previously explained . DRGs from each animal were plated separately , and each experimental group was plated equally and did not receive any further treatment . Immunocytochemistry Cells were ﬁ xed with cooled 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 15min and washed in PBS ( 0 . 1M ) . The cells were then blocked [ PBS - 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 + 1 % BSA ( bovine serum albumin ) ] for 1h at RT and then primary antibodies ( anti ‐ b III tubulin ( Tuj1 , 1 : 1000 , BioLegend ) , anti - NFH ( 1 : 1000 , Merck ) , anti - CCR7 ( 1 : 200 , Abcam ; ab32527 ( 30 ) ) ) , were incubated O / N at 4°C in the same solution . After several washes , Alexa - Fluor - conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated in blocking solution for 1h at RT and cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst . Immunohistochemistry DRGs were dissected and ﬁ xed in PFA 4 % for 2h at 4°C . After washing the DRGs were transferred into cryoprotection solution ( PBS - 30 % sucrose ) for 24h at 4°C . Tissue freezing medium ( OCT , Merck ) was used to freeze the DRGs in blocks , and then 10 m m slices were generated with a cryostat ( Leica CM 1900 ) and mounted on slides . The slides were washed in TTBS ( TBS ( Tris - buffered saline ) + 1 % Tween ) and blocking solution ( 8 % BSA and 0 . 3 % Tx and 1 / 150 m a IgG ( Jackson Immuno Research ) ) was then incubated for 1h at RT . After an O / N incubation with primary antibodies ( anti - TRPV / VR1 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz ; sc - 398417 ( 31 ) ) , anti - CCL21 ( 1 : 200 Peprotech ; 500 - P114 ( 32 ) ) , anti - CCR7 [ 1 : 200 , Abcam ; ab32527 ( 30 ) ) ] in 2 % BSA and 0 . 2 % Tx in TBS at 4°C , and washing , Alexa - Fluor - conjugated secondary antibodies were added in the same solution for 1h at RT . Preparations were then mounted with coverslips in Mowiol ™ ( Merck ) . Western Blot DRG neurons were seeded in 24 - well plates ( 10 . 000 cells / well ) and treated with 50nM of CCL21 2h after seeding . 50min after the treatment media was aspirated and the cells were lysed in 40µl of sample buffer [ 0 . 25M Tris HCL ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 4 % SDS ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 40 % Glycerol ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ] + 10 % of b - mercaptoethanol ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and detached using a scraper . Cell lysates were then heated at 95°C for 10 min and 10 µl were loaded in SDS - 10 % polyacrylamide ( Bio - Rad ) gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) gels . The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Merck ) for 1h at 4°C and the membranes were blocked for 1h with 3 % BSA - TTBS at RT and O / N at 4°C with primary antibody ( pERK ( 1 : 1000 , Cell Signaling ) or 2h at 37°C [ GAPDH ( 1 : 10 . 000 , ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) ] . After several washes , Horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - linked secondary antibodies ( Dako ) were added to the membranes and incubated for 1h at RT , and ﬁ nally developed with ECL ™ substrate ( Merck ) . Intensity quanti ﬁ cations were performed using ImageJ . Fluorescence Intensity Analysis DRG slices were stained for CCL21 and TRPV1 . Images were acquired with a LSM 800 confocal microscope ( Zeiss ) using an AxioCam 503c camera ( Zeiss ) at 20X magni ﬁ cation . Mean CCL21 ﬂ uorescence intensity ( MFI ) was computed in TRPV1 + cells using ImageJ , subtracting the background for each image . Neurite Length Analysis Tuj1 immunocytochemistry was performed and imaged at 10X magni ﬁ cation using an Olympus microscope IX71 with an Orca Flash 4 ( 3 images per well ) . The neurite length of large - diameter ( > 35 m m ) neurons was blindly quanti ﬁ ed with the Neuron J plugin for ImageJ ( 33 ) . Average neurite length per neuron was computed .

All tests performed were two - sided , and adjustments for multiple comparisons and / or signi ﬁ cantly different variances ( Fisher ’ s F ) were applied were indicated . All data analysis was performed blind to the experimental group by two independent experimenters . Unless otherwise stated , sample size was chosen in order to ensure a power of at least 0 . 8 , with a type I error threshold of 0 . 05 , in view of the minimum effect size that was expected . RESULTS CCL21 Expression is Upregulated Upon Nociceptor Activation While most de ﬁ ned neuronal chemokines are induced after traumatic injury or in ﬂ ammatory signalling ( 5 ) , we analysed whether stimulating neuronal activity in the DRG would have an Mesquida - Veny et al . CCL21 Enhances Axonal Regeneration Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 880647 3 impact in chemokine expression and secretion . To this aim we used DRG neuronal cultures expressing ChR2 ( from Thy1 - ChR2 animals ) and subjected them to optical stimulation . We recovered the media 24h later and measured chemokine secretion using a Mouse Chemokine Array ( Raybiotech ) . Interestingly , we found a remarkable increase in CCL21 levels compared to non - stimulated controls ( Figure 1A ) . ChR2 expression in DRGs is ubiquitous among all sensory subtypes ( Supplementary Figures 1A , B ) , however , previous studies reported CCL21 expression speci ﬁ cally in small diameter TRPV1 + nociceptors after peripheral nerve injury ( 13 , 34 ) , so we hypothesized that this CCL21 increase after optogenetic stimulation could be speci ﬁ c of this neuronal subtype . Accordingly , CCL21 expression was increased in TRPV1 + nociceptors 2h after i . pl capsaicin ( TRPV1 agonist ) injection as compared to vehicle administered animals ( Student ’ s T test p = 0 . 0347 ) ( Figures 1B , C ) . CCL21 Promotes Neurite Outgrowth To test whether this chemokine could also in ﬂ uence axonal growth , we administered CCL21 into the sciatic nerve and cultured disaggregated DRG neurons 24h after . This led to an increment in the neurite outgrowth of ex vivo CCL21 - treated DRG neurons when compared to vehicle treated ones ( Student ’ s T test p = 0 . 0046 ) ( Figures 2A , B ) . Additionally , administration of CCL21 at different doses ( 1nM , 10nM , 50nM ) on DRG cultures , resulted in a dose - dependent increase of DRG neurite outgrowth in vitro ( ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test ; Veh vs 50nM p = 0 . 0129 ; 1nM vs 50nM p = 0 . 0440 ) ( Figures 2C , D ) . To further prove that CCL21 produced by TRPV1 + nociceptors could also induce proprioceptive neurite outgrowth , we cultured disaggregated DRG neurons 2h after i . pl . capsaicin administration , a setting in which we observed an increase in CCL21 expression ( Figures 1B , C ) , and observed an increased outgrowth as compared to vehicle treated animals ( Student ’ s T test p = 0 . 0129 ) ( Figures 2E , F ) . CCL21 Activates Proprioceptive CCR7 to Promote Neurite Outgrowth CCL21 is a functional ligand of CCR7 ( 35 ) . We therefore analysed the expression pattern of CCR7 in the DRG . We found CCR7 expression mainly in neurons , including in parvalbumin + ( PV ) neurons , that correspond to proprioceptors ( Figure 3A ) , and very low number of CCR7 + TRPV1 + FIGURE 1 | CCL21 is upregulated upon TRPV1 + nociceptive neuron activation .

Additionally , administering a CCR7 - blocking antibody to DRG cultures inhibited the neurite outgrowth induced by CCL21 as compared to the IgG control ( two - way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test ; interaction p = 0 . 0233 ; IgG - veh vs IgG - CCL21 p = 0 . 0055 ; IgG - CCL21 vs a CCR7 2 m g - veh p = 0 . 0040 ; IgG - CCL21 vs a CCR7 2 m g - CCL21 p = 0 . 0355 ; IgG - CCL21 vs a CCR7 5 m g - veh p = 0 . 0037 ; IgG - CCL21 vs a CCR7 5 m g - CCL21 p = 0 . 0079 ) ( Figures 3D , E ) . Parallelly , although its expression is not detectable in DRGs ( Figure 1A ) , we also tested whether CCL19 , another CCR7 ligand ( 35 ) , would induce the same effects . Oppositely , CCL19 did not result in increased neurite outgrowth when administered in vitro B C D E F A FIGURE 2 | CCL21 enhances DRG neurite outgrowth .

CCL21 - CCR7 activates the MEK - ERK Pathway We then targeted the two main known downstream actuators of CCR7 activation , the MEK pathway and the G i / o protein previously known to be involved in axon growth ( 36 – 38 ) . Pertussis toxin ( Ptx ) administration , an inhibitor of the G i / o protein , did not prevent the CCL21 - induced outgrowth ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) as evidenced by the lack of signi ﬁ cant interaction of the treatments ( p = 0 . 7961 ) on the two - way ANOVA ( Student ’ s t - test w / o ( without ) Ptx : p = 0 . 0115 ; with Ptx : p = 0 . 7458 ) . Conversely , pharmacological inhibition of MEK with U0126 blocked the neurite outgrowth induced by CCL21 ( Figures 4A , B ) , as evidenced by the signi ﬁ cant interaction of the treatments ( p = 0 . 0117 ) on the two - way ANOVA ( multiple comparisons with Bonferroni test : DMSO - Veh vs DMSO - CCL21 p = 0 . 0005 ; DMSO - CCL21 vs U0126 - Veh p = 0 . 0004 ; DMSO - CCL21 vs U0126 - CCL21 p = 0 . 0001 ) . Additionally CCL21 but not CCL19 induced an increase in the phosphorylation of ERK ( Figures 4C , D ) , proving at the same time the presence of a biased CCL21 - CCR7 signalling as well as the role of the MEK - ERK pathway in the CCL21 - CCR7 induced neurite growth . CCL21 - CCR7 - MEK Pathway Modulates Actin Cytoskeleton to Promote Neurite Outgrowth Local assessment of the axonal tips revealed larger growth cones after CCL21 treatment ( Figure 5A ) , this is in consonance with the especially abundant CCR7 expression found on these structures ( Figure 5B ) . We then sought to check the local effects that CCL21 could have in cytoskeletal dynamics of the growth cones . Consequently , we co - administered CCL21 with a low dose of wiskostatin , an inhibitor of the neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) , that acts as an Arp2 / 3 complex activator . Wiskostatin greatly reduced the CCL21 - induced growth , while not having an effect by itself ( Figure 5C ) , supporting a local effect in actin dynamics and branching by CCL21 in the growth cone ( two - way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test ; interaction p = 0 . 0825 ; FIGURE 3 | CCR7 is required for CCL21 - mediated DRG outgrowth .

DISCUSSION There are plenty of evidence that neuronal activity can alter neuronal signalling . In that sense , we found that the expression and release of the chemokine CCL21 is enhanced upon neuronal stimulation . Interestingly , we found that speci ﬁ c TRPV1 + nociceptor stimulation induces CCL21 production , similarly to what has already been described upon axonal injury ( 13 ) . After axonal injury , release of neuronal CCL21 is mainly linked to neuropathic pain ( 13 , 39 ) , however , its role in axon growth and regeneration had never been described before . Interestingly , our results revealed that CCL21 induces growth in proprioceptive neurons through activation of the CCR7 - MEK - ERK pathway , exerting an effect on actin dynamics at the growth cone level .

CCL21 Enhances Axonal Regeneration Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 880647 7 CCL21 was ﬁ rst designated as a recruiting cue for leucocytes , speci ﬁ cally stimulating the migration of T cell subpopulations and dendritic cells ( 22 , 40 – 42 ) . More recently , it has also been described to induce migration in other cells such as tumorigenic or mesenchymal stem cells ( 23 , 43 – 46 ) . Fundamentally , cell migration and axonal growth are events that share similar cellular and molecular machinery ( 25 , 26 ) . Thus , molecules that orchestrate one process are or will most likely be implicated in the other , and vice versa , as for instance what occurs with CXCL12 ( 6 , 47 – 49 ) . We also describe that CCL21 executes its growth - inducing function through its canonical receptor CCR7 , in accordance , we found abundant expression of this receptor on proprioceptive ( PV + ) neurons , both on the soma and on the axon , similarly to the ﬁ ndings of other studies , where neuronal CCR7 is abundantly found in peripheral nerves and hippocampal neurons ( 50 , 51 ) . Activation of CCR7 has already been shown to play a cardinal role in the CCL21 - induced cell migration ( 26 , 40 , 43 , 45 , 52 ) , that , as stated , activates similar cellular and molecular machinery than axonal growth ( 25 , 26 ) . We also found that pharmacological inhibition of the MEK - ERK pathway , one of the main downstream mediators of CCR7 effects , inhibited CCL21 - dependent outgrowth . Additionally , CCL21 administration induced phosphorylation of ERK . These results are in line with other studies de ﬁ ning MEK - ERK as the underlying mechanism of the chemotaxis induced by CCL21 - CCR7 ( 40 , 53 ) . Contrarily , we did not see an effect by inhibiting the G i / o protein in the CCL21 - induced outgrowth , however lack of growth - suppression could derive from inactivation of other growth - inhibitor pathways activated by the G i / o ( 54 ) . While we did not observe any DRG expression of CCL19 , we wanted to test if the other canonical ligand of CCR7 would elicit the same effects observed with CCL21 . Intriguingly , CCL19 administration , did not induce neither ERK phosphorylation nor axonal growth in vitro . These ﬁ ndings strengthen the view of biased ligand - receptor responses , as already shown for CCL21 and CCL19 , which can trigger speci ﬁ c downstream effectors of CCR7 ( 55 , 56 ) . These biased activations result in particular mechanisms activated only by CCL21 , and not CCL19 ; however , this effect often varies depending on the target cell ( 57 – 60 ) MEK - ERK pathway activation has been previously implicated in axonal regeneration ( 37 , 38 , 61 ) . For instance , after peripheral conditioning injury , ERK is phosphorylated and has been shown to affect multiple cellular processes affecting axonal growth , including transcriptional and epigenetic alterations , resulting in increased expression of several regeneration associated genes ( RAGs ) ( 61 ) , increased retrograde transport ( 37 , 62 ) as well as stimulation of cytoskeleton dynamics ( 38 ) . According with the latter , ERK has been shown to have a direct effect on actin polymerization ( 63 , 64 ) , through phosphorylation of different effectors such as WAVE2 , cortactin and Rac1 ( 65 – 69 ) . Remarkably , we found CCR7 expression to be particularly elevated in the growth cones , therefore , we evaluated the effects of actin dynamics in the growth cone as a putative mechanism of the CCL21 - induced growth . In that sense , coadministration of an N - WASP pharmacological inhibitor , a key actin polymerization component , blocked the growth induced by CCL21 .

CCL21 Enhances Axonal Regeneration Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 880647 8 an Arp2 / 3 complex activator , which in turn works as an actin - binding protein , mainly responsible for actin ﬁ lament branching ( 70 ) . Previous studies already showed the essential role of Arp2 / 3 in growth cone progression ( 71 , 72 ) . Mechanistically , ERK is known to phosphorylate cortactin , leading to N - WASP binding and activation ( 66 ) . Thus , in a nutshell , we found that upon CCL21 binding to its receptor CCR7 in the axonal growth cone , there is a downstream MEK - ERK activation , that leads to N - WASP activation , triggering actin ﬁ lament branching in this structure , resulting in increased axonal growth ( Figure 6 ) . Additionally , our ex vivo experiments , in which both capsaicin or CCL21 were administered in the animal before extracting the DRGs and culturing them , demonstrate a lasting effect on DRG somas leading to enhanced neurite outgrowth . While we cannot exclude the presence of a transcriptional reprogramming after CCL21 - CCR7 activation , our model points towards a sustained effect on cytoskeletal remodelling induced by the increased MEK / ERK pathway activation . While CCL21 has been already described for its role in regeneration in other tissues including skin , cartilage , and vascular remodelling ( 23 , 44 , 73 ) , here we describe a novel role of this chemokine in axonal growth . Additionally , the mechanism described involves an unprecedented paracrine dialogue based on chemokines between two different DRG neuronal types . While neurons are highly interconnected through synapses , there is little work regarding other forms of neuronal communication ( 74 ) . Growth factors , for instance , have been implicated in both paracrine and autocrine neuronal communication ( 75 – 78 ) , however , we describe a novel chemokine dependant mechanism of neuron - neuron signalling . Parallelly , we have also unravelled a novel role of nociceptive signalling in sensory axon regeneration . Nociception and pain are tightly associated with tissue injury ( 79 , 80 ) , and while it is not surprising that a signal initiated by an injury could trigger the healing process , after nerve injury chemokine release and nociceptor activity have been typically linked to pathological neuropathic pain . Contrarily , here we show that stimulating nociceptor activity triggers the secretion of a growth - promoting chemokine , CCL21 . In agreement with this , nociceptive signalling participates in the healing cascade of several tissues , for example , nociceptor activation induces adipose tissue regeneration through CGRP ( calcitonin gene - related peptide ) secretion ( 20 ) , angiogenesis via Substance - P - mediated effects ( 19 ) , and skin regeneration through modulation of the immune response ( 21 ) . Pain and nociceptive signalling are complex evolutionary mechanisms that might have further implications than previously anticipated , as they play central roles orchestrating and promoting the healing process in different tissues . This also suggests caution in the indiscriminate use of analgesic drugs and treatments after injury , as these may hinder nociceptive regenerative signalling , limiting the healing process , similarly to the effects observed by broad immunosuppressive drugs ( 81 ) or antioxidants ( 82 ) after spinal cord injuries . Therefore , appropriate timing and level of analgesic administration after injury will likely need to be tailored to provide pain relief while avoiding unwanted effects in hindering the tissue regeneration . An additional intriguing implication is the possibility to modulate nociceptive signalling to achieve tissue regeneration . While therapeutically , inducing nociception is not a reasonable approach , further investigation and characterization of signalling elicited by nociceptor stimulation may increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the healing process , and may enable the future design of therapeutic targets and strategies to foster tissue regeneration .
