The proteins ( see Pflugrath and Quiocho , 1985 ; Luecke and domain structure shows that the four basic residues are Quiocho , 1990 ; He and Quiocho , 1993 , and references located in the first turn of helix a 2 and its preceding loop therein ) . and , in combination with two other strongly conserved AP180binds inositolhexakisphosphate andphospha - positively charged residues ( K / R26 and K30 ; Figure 2 ) tidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - phosphate as well as 3 , 4 - , and 4 , 5 - residing in helix a 1 , constitute a large center of positively phosphates ( Norris et al . , 1995 ; Hao et al . , 1997 ) . This charged surface well suited for binding inositol polyphos - diverse selectivity is consistent with the location of the phates ( Figures 1 , 3A , and 3B ) . The close proximity and binding site mainly on the protein surface and the pres - geometry of the two segments of positively charged resi - ence of several flexible positively charged side chains dues are maintained by an unusual near - circular loop in the site that are capable of making the appropriate between helices a 1 and a 2 . The unusual configuration electrostatic interactions with the different phosphate of the loop is stabilized by dipolar hydrogen - bonding substituents of the inositol head group ( Figures 3A and interactions of its four backbone carbonyl oxygens and 3B ) .

The PH domain is taken from the structure of phospholipase C with bound inositol trisphosphate ( Ferguson et al . , 1995 ) and the FYVE from the structure of the dimeric VHS - FYVE tandem domains ( Mao et al . , 2000 ) . The C2B domain is based on the structure of synaptotagmin III ( Sutton et al . , 1999 ) . The location of the phosphoinositide binding site in the C2B domain was based on ligand binding and site - directed mutagenesis studies of neuronal and non - neuronal synaptotagmins ( Ibata et al . , 1998 ) . The figure was drawn with GRASP . A Leucine Zipper ture , especially in its local environment , which includes the putative clathrin binding motif ( discussed below ) . It has been noted that the NAP domain of the AP180s contains a peptide ( residues 218 – 239 in LAP ; Figure 2 ) that may take part in a leucine zipper for mediating A Mostly Buried and a - Helical Clathrin - Box Motif of the AP180s regulation of the AP180s andtheir association with other proteins ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) . The NAP structure The demonstration that the NAP domain of the AP180s by itself binds to the clathrin triskelia ( Ahle and Unge - reveals that the segment constitutes the last two - thirds of the long helix a 8 ( Figure 1 ) , but it does not resemble wickell , 1986 ; Murphy et al . , 1991 ; Morris et al . , 1993 ; Ye and Lafer , 1995b ) , as well as to phosphoinositides , a potential leucine zipper partner since the leucine and isoleucineresiduesdonothavetherequiredgeometrical indicates that the domain promotes membrane associa - tion and recruitment of clathrin near the plasma mem - spacings . This finding and the fact that the aliphatic residues are mostly buried rule out the participation brane ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . The NAP domain – clathrin interaction is assumed to be between the clathrin - box of the segment in a zipper interaction . However , the structure shows the formation within the domain of a motif that is conserved in several clathrin adaptor pro - teins , including the AP180s , and the N - terminal domain short antiparallel leucine zipper - like interaction between helices a 8 and a 7 ( Figures 1 and 4A ) .

In addition , motifs similar to the clathrin box have been identified in the C - terminal vent exposed .

Our findings came as a complete surprise since the Our findings argue for a different mechanism for the binding of NAP domain to clathrin , one that may involve recent crystal structures of the complexes of the N - termi - naldomain ofclathrin ( td40 ) withpeptides containingthe a different site in the NAP domain , the clathrin triskelia , or in both . Moreover , giventhe large double - sided struc - clathrin box from b arrestin 2 and the b 3 hinge of AP - 3 both revealed extended conformations for the bound ture of the NAP domain and the location of the phospho - inositide binding site at the edge of the triangle - like peptides ( ter Haar et al . , 2000 ) rather than the partly helical motif we discovered .

This rearrangement does not appear possible phoinositide binding site based on helices and loops . It also indicates that the putative clathrin - box motif is not since our experiments , using chemical crosslinking and plasmon resonance techniques , indicate no significant involved in the binding of the NAP domain to clathrin .
