Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 108886 Summary The stiffness of the extracellular matrix exerts powerful effects on cell proliferation and differentiation , but the mechanisms transducing matrix stiffness into cellular fate decisions remain poorly understood . Two widely reported responses to matrix stiffening are increases in actomyosin contractility and cell proliferation . To delineate their relationship , we modulated cytoskeletal tension in cells grown across a physiological range of matrix stiffnesses . On both synthetic and naturally derived soft matrices , and across a panel of cell types , we observed a striking reversal of the effect of inhibiting actomyosin contractility , switching from the attenuation of proliferation on rigid substrates to the robust promotion of proliferation on soft matrices . Inhibiting contractility on soft matrices decoupled proliferation from cytoskeletal tension and focal adhesion organization , but not from cell spread area . Our results demonstrate that matrix stiffness and actomyosin contractility converge on cell spreading in an unexpected fashion to control a key aspect of cell fate . Key words : Actomyosin tension , Cell proliferation , Matrix stiffness Introduction Cells adhered to a rigid substrate , such as a petri dish , typically assemble well - organized actin networks that associate with myosin to form contractile stress fibers ( Cai et al . , 2006 ; Hotulainen and Lappalainen , 2006 ) . These cytoskeletal elements terminate at focal adhesions that link the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix via integrins ( Geiger et al . , 2009 ) . In spread cells , inhibition of RhoA or interference with actomyosin contractility results in the disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions , along with broad inhibition of cell proliferation ( Assoian and Klein , 2008 ; Chicurel et al . , 1998 ; Mammoto and Ingber , 2009 ; Provenzano and Keely , 2011 ; Straight et al . , 2003 ; Wozniak and Chen , 2009 ) . Cell spreading is tightly coupled to proliferation ( Folkman and Moscona , 1978 ; Chen et al . , 1997 ) . Restricting the spread area of adherent cells can lead to growth arrest , but as the spread area increases , so does proliferation . Cell traction forces and RhoA activity also increase with cell spreading ( Califano and Reinhart - King , 2010 ; McBeath et al . , 2004 ; Tolic´ - Nørrelykke et al . , 2005 ; Wang et al . , 2002 ) reinforcing the idea that elevated actomyosin tension promotes cell cycle progression ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . Cell spreading is also controlled by extracellular matrix stiffness . When grown on soft matrices , many cell types exhibit less spreading , as well as reductions in proliferation , traction forces , stress fibers , and focal adhesions ( Aratyn - Schaus and Gardel , 2010 ; Califano and Reinhart - King , 2010 ; Chowdhury et al . , 2010 ; Fringer and Grinnell , 2001 ; Fu et al . , 2010 ; Georges and Janmey , 2005 ; Ghosh et al . , 2007 ; Kong et al . , 2005 ; Levental et al . , 2009 ; Lo et al . , 2000 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Rhee et al . , 2007 ; Saez et al . , 2005 ; Solon et al . , 2007 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ) . These observations , which recapitulate the effects of reducing cytoskeletal tension in spread cells , suggest that insufficient actomyosin - based contractility may underlie the suppression of cell proliferation on soft matrices . Yet , it has also been shown in some cases that actomyosin contractility is not predictive of cell proliferation ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2008 ) and that inhibition of Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) partially rescues rounded endothelial cells from G1 arrest ( Mammoto et al . , 2004 ) . In fact , inhibition of nonmuscle myosin II in fibroblasts grown on a physiologically soft matrix rescues their proliferation to levels attained on rigid substrates ( Mih et al . , 2011 ) . This raises a mystery as to why inhibition of myosin in such contexts should exert such a profound stimulatory effect on cell proliferation , and whether our understanding of tensional control of growth , gleaned mostly from studies on rigid substrates , is incomplete . Here we examine the relationship between cell tension and proliferation across matrices of varying stiffness , and in doing so , attempt to shed light on why soft matrix environments generally suppress the proliferation of adherent cells . Although we confirm that fibroblasts on soft matrices generate lower contractile forces than on rigid matrices , our data demonstrate that inhibition of actomyosin contractility selectively promotes cell proliferation on soft matrices , suggesting that in such contexts , cell - generated forces act as a brake against proliferation . Moreover , we show that cell spreading and proliferation are tightly coupled , even across large variations in matrix stiffness and contractile force generation . Based on these observations , we propose that the ‘excessive’ generation of contractile forces against insufficiently stable cell - matrix adhesions underlies the restriction of cell spreading and proliferation on soft matrices . Results To delineate the combined effects of matrix stiffness and modulation of actomyosin contractile function on cell proliferation , we synthesized polyacrylamide ( PA ) hydrogels of 5974 Research Article J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e defined stiffness within 96 - well glass - bottom plates ( Mih et al . , 2011 ) . The gels were functionalized with monomeric collagen I at a constant density across all stiffness conditions , allowing for the isolation of matrix stiffness effects . Using this system , we compared cell growth on collagen I - coated rigid ( glass ) versus relatively soft , physiologically relevant PA gels ( 1 kPa elastic [ Young’s ] modulus ) ( Discher et al . , 2005 ; Klein et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ) , and confirmed that inhibition of myosin II with blebbistatin evoked divergent dose - dependent effects on cell number ( Fig . 1A ) , enhancing proliferation on a soft matrix while inhibiting proliferation on glass ( Mih et al . , 2011 ) . We documented a similar trend of increasing BrdU incorporation , indicative of ongoing DNA synthesis , when blebbistatin was applied to cells on 0 . 3 and 1 kPa gels , and decreasing BrdU incorporation when blebbistatin was applied on rigid surfaces ( Fig . 1B ) . We next applied inhibitors of Rho and ROCK , which are upstream controllers of actomyosin contractile function , to fibroblasts cultured on glass and 1 kPa gels . Similarly divergent stiffness - dependent effects on cell proliferation were observed with each of these treatments , including the Rho antagonist C3 transferase and two ROCK inhibitors , Y27632 and GSK429286 ( Fig . 1C ) . While the analogous results across a panel of independent treatments were indicative of on - target effects , to directly link the divergent responses to myosin inactivation we employed siRNA targeting non - muscle myosin heavy chain IIa ( MYH9 ) . Blots confirming the efficacy of siRNA knockdown are included in the supplementary material ( supplementary material Fig . S1 ) . Across a range of siRNA concentrations ( 0 . 005 – 50 nM ) , we found that partial MYH9 knockdown ( 0 . 5 nM ) exerted divergent effects on cell proliferation between glass and 1 kPa gels ( Fig . 1D ) , recapitulating the small molecule inhibitor results . To confirm that the divergent effects of Rho – ROCK – myosin inhibition reflected a bona fide influence of matrix stiffness , we applied a single dose of selected inhibitors to fibroblasts cultured on 0 . 3 , 1 , 6 , 20 kPa gels and glass ( Fig . 1E ) . In all cases , the proliferation - promoting effects of inhibiting actomyosin tension were reproduced on the softest matrices , and gradually dissipated or reversed as matrix stiffness increased , establishing that the conditional nature of Rho – ROCK – myosin effect on cell proliferation is a function of underlying matrix stiffness . Extending these observations to other cell types , we found that the divergent matrix stiffness - dependent effects of ROCK inhibition were broadly , though not universally , conserved across a panel of primary and transformed cell lines ( Fig . 1F ) . Primary low passage fibroblasts from human lungs ( NHLF ) , as well as primary human bone marrow - derived ( hMSC ) and adipose - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hASC ) , all recapitulated the stiffness - dependent effects of ROCK inhibition . Similarly , IMR - 90 and NIH3T3 fibroblast cell lines demonstrated divergent stiffness - dependent responses , as did the RLE6TN rat lung epithelial cell line . In contrast , A549 and MDCKII epithelial cell lines exhibited little response to ROCK inhibition on stiff substrates , with relatively muted increases in cell number on 1 kPa gels . Intriguingly , the breast cancer derived MDA - MB - 231 cell line was the most sensitive in our panel to growth inhibition on a stiff matrix , and was the only line that did not increase its growth on 1 kPa gels upon ROCK inhibition . While the panel of cell types tested here is far from exhaustive , the aggregate results point toward a potentially broad relevance of stiffness - dependent actomyosin effects , particularly among non - transformed mesenchymal cell types . We also applied ROCK inhibitor treatments to fibroblasts growing within three - dimensional Geltrex matrices , which are derived from the basement membrane of Engelbreth – Holm – Swarm tumor cells and have mechanical properties in the range of softest PA gels used above . Similar to our observations on soft , synthetic 2D matrices , we confirmed that Y27632 and GSK429286 stimulated fibroblast proliferation within these soft , biologically derived 3D matrices ( Fig . 1G ) , switching from a net loss in cell number in the absence of inhibitors to a net gain of cells with ROCK inhibition . Based on the considerable evidence positively linking cell proliferation to focal adhesions and actomyosin force generation ( Assoian and Klein , 2008 ; Huang and Ingber , 1999 ; Mammoto and Ingber , 2009 ; Provenzano and Keely , 2011 ; Wozniak and Chen , 2009 ) , we first suspected that inhibition of Rho , ROCK , and myosin might be exerting unanticipated effects on these structural and functional features when applied to cells growing on soft matrices . We began by measuring each of these features and their variation across matrix stiffness under baseline culture conditions . We found that increasing matrix stiffness promotes a subtle increase in staining for phosphorylated myosin light chain ( Fig . 2A ) , and a gradual rise in cellular force generation with increasing matrix stiffness ( Fig . 2B ) , as measured by Fourier transform traction microscopy ( Butler et al . , 2002 ; Marinkovic´ et al . , 2012 ) . As expected , increasing matrix stiffness also enhances the organization of increasingly large islands of adhesion proteins , visualized by vinculin ( Fig . 2D ) and talin ( Fig . 2E ) immunostaining and quantified by mean focal adhesion length ( Fig . 2F ) . These trends are consistent with prior observations ( Califano and Reinhart - King , 2010 ; Chowdhury et al . , 2010 ; Fu et al . , 2010 ; Ghosh et al . , 2007 ; Kong et al . , 2005 ; Lo et al . , 2000 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Saez et al . , 2005 ) . When we treated cells with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 , all of these structural and functional readouts changed as expected , without any unusual variation across matrix stiffness conditions . That is , ROCK inhibition attenuated myosin light chain phosphorylation ( Fig . 2A ) and reduced cell tractions by more than 50 % in every condition ( Fig . 2B ) , indicating a loss of cytoskeletal tension and effectively decoupling cell tractions from proliferation ( Fig . 2C ) . Similarly , vinculin and talin staining was reduced by ROCK inhibition on stiff PA gels ( Fig . 2D , E ) , and focal adhesions remained small or undetectable on soft PA gels ( Fig . 2F ) . Therefore , while all of these features naturally vary across matrix stiffness , and in all cases correlate with baseline cell proliferation , our observation that ROCK inhibition on soft matrices stimulates cell proliferation , while each of these features is suppressed or remains absent , indicates that they do not positively regulate matrix stiffness - dependent control of proliferation . To ascertain how actomyosin tension might act to inhibit cell proliferation on soft matrices , we first noted that at baseline , cells on highly compliant matrices ( , 1 kPa ) exhibit a rounded morphology ( Fig . 3A ) . Although cells on soft substrates tend to interact more with each other and form colonies ( Guo et al . , 2006 ) , here fibroblasts were seeded sparsely and remained well distributed ( Fig . 3A ) , arguing against contact - inhibition as the primary restraint against proliferation . Strikingly , inhibition of ROCK or myosin II engaged cell spreading on these soft matrices ( Fig . 3A ) , consistent with observations that inhibition of NMM - II Matrix stiffness reverses tension effect 5975 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Fig . 1 .

Quantifying this spreading effect in cell populations across matrix stiffness conditions , we observed an increase in 2D projected cell area after ROCK inhibition on soft PA gels ( Fig . 3B ) . This area change exceeded that which would be expected from relaxation of cell contraction alone , consistent with initiation of an active cell spreading process upon ROCK inhibition . At baseline , we found that 2D cell area tracked with matrix stiffness up to a plateau at 20 kPa ( Fig . 3B ) , and was well correlated with the effect of matrix stiffness on cell proliferation . ROCK inhibition induced dramatic cell spreading on soft matrices , up to 10 - fold on 0 . 3 kPa substrates , while evoking comparably little effect on stiff matrices ( Fig . 3B ) . Simultaneous knockdown of ROCK1 and ROCK2 with siRNA also enhanced cell spreading on soft matrices ( Fig . 3C ) and recapitulated the divergent effects of ROCK inhibitors on cell proliferation between glass and 1 kPa gels ( Fig . 3D ) and across a range of stiffness conditions ( Fig . 3E ) .

Matrix stiffness reverses tension effect 5977 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Fig . 3 . See next page for legend . Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 24 ) 5978 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e and cell area across matrix stiffness both with and without Y27632 treatment , these features remained tightly correlated ( Fig . 3F ) , in contrast with the lack of a positive correlation with cell tractions ( Fig . 2C ) . Time - lapse imaging provided dramatic confirmation of the morphological effects of ROCK inhibition on individual cells cultured on soft matrices ( Fig . 3G ; supplementary material Movie 1 ) . Upon treatment , cells quickly transitioned from small , roughly round shapes to the extension of prominent dendrite - like projections not unlike those observed in fibroblasts spreading within soft 3D hydrogels ( Grinnell et al . , 2003 ; Rhee et al . , 2007 ) . This response is analogous to the increase in proplatelet extensions that occurs upon inhibition of myosin II in megakaryocytes ( Shin et al . , 2011 ) , which was also reported to generate an increase in MK polyploidy . Although we did not observe any multinucleation in the fibroblasts tested here , it is notable that in both contexts inhibition of myosin II leads to increased DNA replication . The transition in cell morphology induced by ROCK inhibition was reversible , as visualized upon washout of Y27632 ( Fig . 3G ; supplementary material Movie 2 ) , emphasizing the plasticity of cell spreading on soft substrates and the dynamic and transient nature of cell – matrix adhesions formed upon ROCK inhibition . If an excess of endogenous actomyosin tension is responsible for impaired spreading and proliferation on soft matrices , then the enhancement of actomyosin tension on relatively soft matrices should further reduce cell spreading and proliferation . Consistent with this hypothesis , we previously observed that the small molecule cantharidin , which increases contractility through inhibition of protein phosphatase I ( Knapp et al . , 1998 ) , suppresses the proliferation of cells on 1 kPa gels but not on glass substrates ( Mih et al . , 2011 ) . Here we verified that the effect of cantharidin ( 1 m M ) was dependent on matrix stiffness ( Fig . 4A ) . Using traction force microscopy , we found that cantharidin evoked a modest but significant increase in cell tractions on 13 kPa gels , but surprisingly evoked a more mixed effect on 1 kPa gels that did not reach statistical significance ( Fig . 4B ) . Instead , time - lapse imaging on a 1 kPa gel revealed that cantharidin enhanced cell – matrix adhesion failure and cell retraction ( Fig . 4C ; see supplementary material Movie 3 ) , suggesting that endogenous tension had in fact increased , but that adhesions failure was precluding a sustained increase in tractions on this soft matrix . Consistent with this interpretation , cantharidin treatment reduced 2D cell area on 1 kPa gels but not stiffer matrices ( Fig . 4D ) , as did siRNA knockdown of the myosin - binding subunit of myosin phosphatase , MYPT1 ( Fig . 4E ) , providing further evidence of an inverse relationship between actomyosin tension and cell spreading on soft matrices . Knockdown of MYPT1 also suppressed cell proliferation on 1 kPa gels with comparatively little effect on glass ( Fig . 4F ) , recapitulating the stiffness - dependent effect of cantharidin . In agreement with the causal link between cell spreading and proliferation suggested above , cantharidin reduced cell proliferation rates as it reduced spreading , mirroring the ability of Rho – ROCK – myosin inhibition to promote cell spreading and proliferation on soft matrices . When plotted together , growth rates from the various matrix stiffness conditions at baseline and in the presence of Y27632 or cantharidin ( Fig . 5A ) collapsed onto a single curve , demonstrating a critical limiting role of 2D cell area on potential proliferation rate . This unifying observation was also observed when comparing the effects of knockdown of ROCK1 + ROCK2 , MYH9 , or MYPT1 on cell area and proliferation on rigid and 1 kPa substrates ( Fig . 5B ) . Together , these findings illustrate how manipulations of cytoskeletal tension and matrix stiffness shift cell behaviors along a master curve that relates cell proliferation to spreading . Discussion Cells residing in soft matrix environments typically exhibit reduced proliferation or growth - arrest ( Klein et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Mih et al . , 2011 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Tilghman et al . , 2010 ; Ulrich et al . , 2009 ) . Many cellular features that are expressed on rigid substrates are also downregulated on soft matrices , including cell spreading , traction forces , myosin light chain phosphorylation , and focal adhesion assembly ( Aratyn - Schaus and Gardel , 2010 ; Califano and Reinhart - King , 2010 ; Chowdhury et al . , 2010 ; Fringer and Grinnell , 2001 ; Fu et al . , 2010 ; Georges and Janmey , 2005 ; Ghosh et al . , 2007 ; Kong et al . , 2005 ; Levental et al . , 2009 ; Lo et al . , 2000 ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Rhee et al . , 2007 ; Saez et al . , 2005 ; Solon et al . , 2007 ; Wozniak et al . , 2003 ) . Because all of these features rise in concert with increasing matrix stiffness , each is suspected to play a positive role in the regulation of proliferation . However , on soft matrices ( E , 6 kPa ) , we found that inhibiting actomyosin contractility led to a robust increase in proliferation ( Fig . 1 ) , in some cases rising to maximal proliferation rates attained on rigid substrates . The enhancement of cell proliferation simultaneous with suppression of cell tractions , p - MLC levels , and focal adhesions reveals that in this context , they are not fundamentally coupled with proliferation ( Fig . 2 ) . While this finding does not contradict the notion that some or all of these features may support or are necessary for proliferation in rigid environments ( Assoian and Klein , 2008 ; Huang and Ingber , 1999 ; Mammoto and Ingber , 2009 ; Provenzano and Keely , 2011 ; Wozniak and Chen , 2009 ) , they do demonstrate that such relationships break down on soft matrices . In contrast , our results show that cell area remains tightly coupled with proliferation across wide variations in matrix stiffness and actomyosin contractility ( Fig . 5A , B ) .

Matrix stiffness reverses tension effect 5979 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e transition from round to dendritic morphologies following inhibition of ROCK or myosin II ( Fig . 3A , G ) , suggesting that the failure of cells to spread on soft matrices is due to a relative excess of actomyosin tension , not a lack thereof . Consistent with this explanation , we observed measurable cell tractions and phosphorylated myosin light chain on soft matrices that were attenuated by inhibition of ROCK ( Fig . 2 ) . Time - lapse imaging of the reversible and opposite effects of ROCK inhibition and cantharidin treatment on cell tractions and spreading offers further support for our conclusion that a matrix stiffness - dependent failure of cell – matrix adhesions underlies the restriction of cell spreading and proliferation on soft matrices . On rigid substrates , it is known that nascent adhesions normally grow and are reinforced under tension ( Aratyn - Schaus and Gardel , 2010 ; Balaban et al . , 2001 ; Galbraith et al . , 2002 ; Geiger et al . , 2009 ; Kuo et al . , 2011 ) . This process can be interrupted by Rho and ROCK inhibition , leading to adhesion disassembly . In contrast , our data suggest that on soft matrices , endogenous actomyosin - generated forces are too strong for nascent adhesions to persist or mature , limiting stable cell spreading . In the soft matrix context , ROCK inhibition appears to permit stable cell spreading through a mechanism that is independent of adhesion maturation ( Galbraith et al . , 2002 ; Pasapera et al . , 2010 ) , as we did not observe vinculin - or talin - positive focal adhesion assembly in cells that spread following ROCK inhibition ( Fig . 2D , E ) . The soft matrix adhesions that form remain vulnerable , however , as ROCK inhibitor washout leads to adhesions failure rather than maturation ( Aratyn - Schaus and Gardel , 2010 ) , and cells revert to a rounded shape . Together , these observations suggest that the immature and transient nature Fig . 4 . Enhancing actomyosin tension leads to cell retraction and reduced proliferation on soft matrices .

Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 24 ) 5980 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e of adhesions on soft matrices is not due to a deficit in Rho - mediated tension , but on the contrary , arises from the inability of adhesions to reinforce and resist tension . The robust relationship observed here between cell area and proliferation echoes previous observations of cell proliferation controlled by cell spreading ( Chen et al . , 1997 ; Folkman and Moscona , 1978 ) . Similarly , the proliferative status of single endothelial cells can be predicted by nuclear volume , but not cell contractility ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2008 ) . While the mechanism underlying shape - dependent control of cell proliferation is not known , our results are consistent with actomyosin tension acting upstream of cell shape to regulate proliferation on soft matrices , and not vice versa . They are also reminiscent of analogous relationships observed for other cell behaviors such as motility , where the same perturbation can have opposite effects on cells on soft versus stiff surfaces ( Ulrich et al . , 2009 ) or on low versus high matrix ligand densities ( Palecek et al . , 1997 ) . In terms of mechanism , our preliminary efforts to identify cell cycle regulatory genes that control the stiffness - dependent growth effects of ROCK inhibition did not identify obvious candidates , indicating that more work will be needed to elucidate the underlying molecular network controlling this cellular response ( supplementary material Table S1 ) . Taken together , our results demonstrate that a matrix stiffness - dependent balance between adhesions failure and reinforcement underlies a critical switch in Rho – ROCK – myosin effector functions . This switch occurs at an intermediate range of matrix stiffness ( E , 6 – 20 kPa ) , where the effect of reducing cell tension on proliferation transitions from stimulatory to inhibitory . Below this threshold , cell shape and proliferation appear to be sensitively tuned to perturbations in actomyosin tension and matrix stiffness ( Fig . 5 ) . Because the range of matrix stiffness investigated here is relevant to a broad subset of human tissues , cellular processes , and disease conditions ( Butcher et al . , 2009 ; Discher et al . , 2005 ; Guilak et al . , 2009 ; Klein et al . , 2009 ; Moore et al . , 2010 ; Wozniak and Chen , 2009 ) , these results may have important implications for our understanding of cell growth control in soft tissue environments . Materials and Methods Cell culture and assays Primary normal human lung fibroblasts ( Lonza ) were used at passage 3 – 6 . Primary human bone marrow - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( Tulane University , USA ) were used at passage 1 – 3 , and human adipose - derived stem cells at passage 1 – 3 ( ZenBio ) . All other cell types were obtained from ATCC . All cells were cultured in Kaighn’s Modification of Ham’s F12 Medium ( F12K ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 m g / ml streptomycin ( all from Cellgro ) in a humidified 37 ˚ C incubator with 5 % CO 2 . Y27632 , GSK429286 , cantharidin , and ( + / 2 ) blebbistatin were purchased from Tocris Bioscience , and cell - permeable C3 transferase obtained from Cytoskeleton . Unless otherwise indicated , cells were seeded in serum - free F12K media at 25 cells / mm 2 in multiwell plates containing polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates of defined stiffness . The hydrogels were cast and functionalized with collagen as Fig . 5 . Actomyosin tension and matrix stiffness converge on cell spreading to control proliferation . ( A ) Relationship between cell proliferation and area across five stiffness conditions . Proliferation is expressed as cell number relative to a control , rigid ( glass , G ) condition following 72 hours of culture . For Y27632 and cantharidin treatment conditions , data are proliferation means 6 s . e . m . ( n $ 4 ) plotted against mean cell areas obtained in Fig . 3B and Fig . 4D . Elastic moduli ( kPa ) corresponding to each data point are indicated . ( B ) Effect of ROCK1 + ROCK2 , MYH9 , and MYPT1 knockdown on cell area and proliferation . Cell numbers in soft ( 1 kPa ) and rigid ( G ) conditions were determined 6 days following siRNA transfection . Proliferation is expressed as fold change in cell number relative to the rigid condition containing a matched concentration of non - targeting siRNA . Cell areas were determined 3 days following siRNA transfection . Data are proliferation means 6 s . d . ( n 5 3 ) plotted against mean cell areas from one representative experiment . Matrix stiffness reverses tension effect 5981 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e previously described ( Mih et al . , 2011 ) . Four hours after seeding , media was replaced with F12K media with 10 % serum and the indicated concentrations of drugs . Cell number was evaluated by Cyquant NF Cell Proliferation Assay ( Life Technologies ) , which generates a fluorescent signal that is linearly correlated with cell number . Traction microscopy IMR - 90 lung fibroblasts were used for all traction measurements . The cells were seededat10 cells / mm 2 on0 . 3 , 1 , 6 , and20 kPaPAgelsfunctionalizedwithcollagen I ( Purecol , Advanced Biomatrix ) . Fluorescent sulfate - modified microspheres , 0 . 2 m m in diameter , were attached to the gel surface and improved throughput traction microscopy ( Marinkovic´ et al . , 2012 ) was employed to capture the microsphere positions before and after removal of the cell by trypsinization . The pairs of fluorescent images were processed through a two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm ( Tolic - Norrelykkeet al . , 2002 ) to obtain thedisplacementfield of the beads underneath the cell , and Fourier transform traction cytometry ( Butler et al . , 2002 ) was used to calculate the corresponding traction field generated by the cell on the gel surface . In order to compare measured traction fields , both in control and indicated treatment conditions , we computed root - mean - square tractions ( RMSTs ) . The coordinates of the cell boundary required for traction calculation were obtained from the fluorescent images of the cell membrane ( CellLight Plasma Membrane - RFP , Invitrogen ) by applying a global threshold image processing algorithm ( Marinkovic´ et al . , 2012 ) . All images were taken at 200 6 magnification . Cells were cultured on the gels for 24 hours prior to performing baseline traction measurements . Immunofluorescence and cell area measurements IMR - 90 cells were seeded at 25 cells / mm 2 and cultured for 24 hours on PA gels or glass substrate . The cells were fixed in formalin , blocked with 10 % normal goat serum in PBS for 1 hour , and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 minutes . The cells were incubated overnight with a mouse monoclonal antibody against vinculin ( hVIN - 1 , Sigma ) , a mouse monoclonal antibody against talin ( TLN01 , sc - 59882 , Santa Cruz Biotechnologies ) , or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated myosin light chain 2 ( S19 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) , all diluted at 1 : 500 . They were then washed 3 6 for 5 minutes each and incubated for 1 hour with a secondary goat anti - mouse ( or rabbit ) AlexaFlour 488 - conjugated antibody ( Life Technologies ) diluted 1 : 500 in PBS , and washed 3 6 prior to fluorescence imaging . For measurements of cell area , fixed cells were stained with Alexafluor 586 - phalloidin and Hoechst ( Life Technologies ) , and fluorescent images were analyzed by CellProfiler ( Broad Institute ) to calculate 2D projected cell area based on F - actin staining . Focal adhesion morphometry was analyzed by established methods ( Dugina et al . , 2001 ) using MetaMorph 6 software . The length of stained FAs was defined by their longest axis in the direction of lamellar spreading and was measured within the lamellar zone of cell edge ( Fig . 2B ) . RNA interference IMR - 90 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Life Technologies ) with an siRNA SMARTpool ( Thermo Scientific ) containing four siRNAS targeting human MYH9 , ROCK1 , ROCK2 , MYPT1 , or a non - targeting SMARTpool ( see supplementary material Table S2 for siRNA sequences ) . Cells were seeded onto 1 kPa or rigid substrates and exposed to 0 . 005 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 , 5 , or 50 nM of targeting or non - targeting siRNA . For simultaneous knockdown of ROCK1 and ROCK2 , equivalent amounts of each siRNA were added to reach the indicated concentration . Media was replaced after 8 hours and cells were cultured for 6 days . Cell number was determined using the Cyquant assay . Knockdown of each siRNA target was confirmed by western blot following 72 hours of transfection using 1 : 1000 dilutions of rabbit antibodies against MYH9 , ROCK1 , MYPT ( Cell Signaling Technologies ) , and ROCK2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Chemiluminescence - based detection was performed using a 1 : 2000 dilution of secondary HRP - linked goat anti - rabbit antibody ( Cell Signaling Technologies ) followed by exposure to SuperSignal West Femto Substrate ( Thermo Scientific ) and imaging with a high - resolution CCD camera ( Syngene ) . 3D culture IMR - 90 cells were mixed with Geltrex reduced growth factor basement membrane extract ( Life Technologies ) at 1 part cell solution to 9 parts Geltrex and at a final density of 50 , 000 cells / ml . 50 m l of the mixture was delivered to individual wells of a non - TC - treated , 96 - well polystyrene plate and allowed to gel for one hour at 37 ˚ C . The hydrogels were overlaid with media and incubated for 4 hours prior to addition of ROCK inhibitors . The number of cells after 5 days of culture relative to the initial seeding density at 4 hours was determined using a cell counting kit ( Donjindo ) based on the colorimetric detection of formazan . The number of cells attaching to the rigid well bottom was negligible under all conditions . PCR array IMR - 90 fibroblasts were seeded at subconfluency on 1 kPa and glass substrates and cultured for 24 hours in F12K media containing 10 % FBS . Cells in each condition were then exposed to 10 m M Y27632 or no treatment for 12 hours . Total RNA was isolated using a spin - column based kit ( RNeasy , Qiagen ) with DNase I digestion . RNA ( 100 ng ) was reverse transcribed to cDNA ( RT 2 First Strand Kit , Qiagen ) , combined with RT 2 SYBR Green qPCR Mastermix ( Qiagen ) , and delivered to a 96 - well , Human Cell Cycle PCR Array ( Qiagen ) . The array was subject to 95 ˚ C for 10 minutes , then 40 cycles of 95 ˚ C for 15 seconds and 60 ˚ C for 1 minute using a real - time PCR cycler ( Applied Biosystems Model 7300 ) .
