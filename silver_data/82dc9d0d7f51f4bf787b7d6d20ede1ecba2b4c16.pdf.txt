ORIGINAL ARTICLE Decolonising research methodologies : lessons from a qualitative research project , Cape Town , South Africa Mpoe Johannah Keikelame and Leslie Swartz Department of Psychology , Stellenbosch University , Cape Town , South Africa ABSTRACT Background : It is becoming increasingly important for researchers to critically reflect on approaches that can have a positive impact on the health outcomes of indigenous people . Such issues are of great importance and perhaps of special relevance to researchers in the Global South , and to the African context in which we work . Objective : To share some lessons learned from our fieldwork to contribute to current knowl - edge and conversations on decolonising research process . Methods : We used an African lens to critically reflect upon some issues raised from individual interviews and focus group discussions with our participants which we deem to be important for consideration in a decolonising research process . Results : The major issues that we raise are about important structures such as power , trust , cultural competence , respectful and legitimate research practice and recognition of individual and communities ’ health assets in a decolonising research process . Conclusions : Our paper argues for alternative approaches which are culturally appropriate for health research and for improved health outcomes of marginalised groups . In addition , we argue that participatory and transformative research methods which recognises individual and communities ’ assets are needed . We hope that the lessons that we share in this paper can contribute towards a respectful and good research practice among the marginalised population groups in our context . ARTICLE HISTORY Received 19 April 2018 Accepted 7 December 2018 RESPONSIBLE EDITOR John Kinsman , Umeå University , Sweden KEYWORDS Indigenous ; power ; trust ; culture and cultural competency Background When indigenous people become the researchers and not merely the researched , the activity of research is transformed . Questions are framed differently , priorities are ranked differently , problems are defined differently , people participate on different terms . ( Smith 1999 , cited in Zavala [ 1 , p . 59 ] ) It is becoming increasingly important for researchers to critically reflect on approaches that can have a positive impact on the health outcomes of indigenous people . Such issues are of great importance and perhaps of special relevance to research in the Global South , and to the African context in which we work . According to Nhemachena et al . [ 2 ] , research conducted among indi - genous people in Africa has often not resulted in improved health outcomes of the researched . For these authors , research has in fact resulted in Africa suffering from a ‘ resource curse of collectors and discoverers of African material resources , cultural artefacts and knowl - edge ’ [ p . 9 ] . A decolonising research methodology is an approach that is used to challenge the Eurocentric research methods that undermine the local knowl - edge and experiences of the marginalised population groups [ 2 – 5 ] . As stated by Goduka et al . in Khupe and Keane [ 3 , p . 26 ] , for research to be relevant and thus improve the quality of life of indigenous peo - ple , it should be driven by indigenous worldviews , cultural values and a language that is relevant to the indigenous group with whom research is underta - ken . It should also be propelled by constructive discussions on knowledge systems and how these systems restrain and exclude other forms of knowl - edge , and the kind of actions needed for these sys - tems to be more open and integrated [ 4 ] . For Zavala [ 1 ] , researchers should note that decolonising research is not as much about the method , but more about the spaces that can enable the research process – and that through this process , researchers ’ identities also become reshaped or transformed . Scholars writing in this field argue that researchers should use an indigenous lens in all phases of the project to scrutinise the choice of theoretical frame - works and methodologies they use and how research findings can be translated into actions that promote social justice [ 4 , 5 ] . On the other hand , Louis ( cited in Keane et al . ) [ 6 , p . 14 ] , caution that research that has negative health outcomes for the researched should not be conducted .

Colonialism in South Africa Colonialism has been reported globally as one of the key determinants of health of indigenous population groups [ 7 ] , while post - colonialism is about the ongoing struggle to address the impact of the injus - tices of colonialism on indigenous people [ 4 ] . In terms of colonisation in South Africa , Oliver and Oliver [ 8 , p . 4 – 8 ] report that the country had four types of colonisation : ( i ) unofficial colonisation by the Black people from the north ; ( ii ) official colonisation from the south by the Dutch VOC ; ( iii ) official colo - nisation by Great Britain ; and ( iv ) internal colonisa - tion from 1961 by the White Afrikaners which ended in 1994 . According to these authors , the White Afrikaner apartheid rule was the severest of all types of colonisation due to its oppressive and exclusive policies . Despite the country ’ s changeover from apartheid to democracy , the major disparities in pro - vision of healthcare still exists and has greatly affected the health and well - being of the majority of the low socio - economic population groups [ 9 , 10 ] . Though on paper there are several policies to redress these health inequities , there has been very little progress regarding the transformation of the healthcare system via the envisaged National Health Insurance system ( NHI ) . The NHI system aims to prioritise healthcare services and to provide inclusive comprehensive public healthcare coverage and access to the healthcare services to all population groups in the country [ 11 ] . However , Rispel [ 12 ] and van Rensburg [ 13 ] warn that factors such as poor leader - ship , management and governance , lack of a fully functional district health system and political com - mitment to address the health workforce crisis may inhibit the successful implementation of the NHI system . In this article , we use an African lens to highlight some important research process issues which came to the fore on conducting a qualitative study which explored perspectives and subjective experiences of adults who had epilepsy and their carers in an urban Xhosa speaking township in Cape Town , South Africa . We argue that structures such as power , trust , culture and cultural competence , respectful and legitimate research practice and recog - nition of individual and communities ’ assets are important issues to consider when conducting research among the marginalised population groups . Background to the study Our qualitative research project explored perspectives and subjective experiences of living with epilepsy and caring for people having the illness . The setting in which we conducted the study is an urban township in Cape Town , South Africa – and one of the first townships established under the oppressive laws of the apartheid system . This resulted in the margin - alisation of the residents – a situation that remains unchanged even after democracy . As part of the study , we interviewed adult patients with epilepsy and their carers . Carers included family members , home - based carers who provide community - based care via home visits , and traditional healers . In South Africa , most of the population consult with these healers for their healthcare needs [ 14 ] . We are of the view that the lessons we share from our reflex - ive process will enable other researchers to learn from our experiences and that these can contribute to current knowledge and conversations in this field . Although we use the term indigenous , we note from literature that there are controversies surrounding the definition of indigeneity in low - and middle - income countries ( LMICs ) . Others , such as Ohenjo et al . , as cited in Mohindra [ 15 , p . 582 ] , state that many Africans view themselves as indigenous due to their past experi - ences of colonialism . But Hillary Weaver [ 16 ] cautions that indigeneity is a very complex term which is the subject of controversy , and that it can have different interpretations . The author critically questions whether the term refers to issues such as race , ethnicity , tribal identity , cultural identity or other types of identity . Others such as Telles and Torche [ 17 ] are of the view that indigeneity cannot be understood through censuses because of their reliance on certain indicators . They caution against referring to all people as indigenous as this may risk ignoring the perspectives of the majority of the marginalised and those to whom indigeneity may be worthwhile . We are therefore of the view that future research should explore how the term indigeneity is understood and perceived by the researched and the researchers in our context . Our research experience and lessons for a decolonising research process Drawing from her experience in the field , the first author , Keikelame [ 18 ] , reflects on some of the chal - lenges that she faced on conducting her research project on epilepsy , recently published in an article entitled : The tortoise under the couch : An African woman ’ s reflections on negotiating inside - outsider positionalities and issues of serendipity on conducting a qualitative research project . Keikelame is a Black African South African woman , but nevertheless not an insider to the cultural group she was studying . Despite that she is conversant with the groups ’ spo - ken language , her positions often shifted between insider and outsider due to varied contextual issues that came to the fore during fieldwork . She uses a metaphor of a tortoise to share her critical reflections on some of these important lessons that emerged during her fieldwork which could be vital for a 2 M . J . KEIKELAME AND L . SWARTZ decolonising process . For her , an approach to a deco - lonising process should be paced slowly and should be characterised by commitment , courage and perse - verance – like the tortoise ' s commitment . She shares some important issues that other researchers can learn from when doing research among the margin - alised population groups : issues of language ; of inter - preters , translators and transcribers ; of ethics ; of religion and faith ; of reciprocity ; of unexpectedness ; and of identity , age and gender . In the section below , we discuss the five central tensions and structures which we deem to be of importance in decolonising research methodologies : ( i ) power ; ( ii ) trust ; ( iii ) culture and cultural compe - tence ; ( iv ) respectful and legitimate research practice ; and ( v ) recognition of individual and communities ’ assets . We use the pronoun ‘ I ’ to refer to the first author as she is the principal investigator , and the larger part of our discussion is based on her personal experiences , reflections and interactions in the field . Power The notion of a ‘ power with ’ rather than ‘ power over ’ approach when conducting research among margin - alised and vulnerable population groups is crucial because the approach puts emphasis on equal power sharing between researchers and the researched [ 19 , p . 76 ] . Power can be influenced by the researchers ’ outsider - insider positions as well as the experiences of colonialism on both the researcher and the researched [ 20 ] . It is deemed by Harrits [ 21 ] as a coercive structure that permeates all human relations . As reported by Darroch and Giles [ 22 ] , a feminist lens may be useful to examine issues of power that are characterised by race , education and class . For these theorists , the researcher is not the sole producer of knowledge – but both the researcher and the researched make equitable and valuable contributions to the research process . They contend that issues of power should therefore be examined throughout the research process . In our study , issues of power emerged from some stories told by our participants . From our focus group discussion with traditional healers , we learned that formal agreements such as the memorandum of understanding ( MOU ) and protection of traditional knowledge is crucial [ 23 ] . This concern about MOUs has also been raised by Alcock et al . [ 24 ] in their content - based literature review conducted in Canada . They concluded that MOUs are vital for engaging in legitimate and respectful research practice and assert that such a step is a form of empowerment of research partners and can also enhance sound collaboration through transparency of roles , expectations and actions . Other authors such as Alonso [ 25 ] state that such agreements are important because they are powerful tools with which people can fight against exploitation of their rights and to object to unfair research practices . Additionally , Masango [ 26 , p . 76 ] reports that the World Intellectual Property Organization deems it important to protect traditional knowledge ‘ from being exploited by appropriation for financial gains by third parties ’ . Masango [ 26 ] further states that protection of indigenous knowledge is cru - cial because traditional knowledge includes knowledge about the use of some plants , identification of medic - inal properties in some of the plants and harvesting practices – this knowledge can therefore be protected within intellectual property rights . In addition , the design of MOU ’ s can be enabled by using strategies such as mediation and setting up formal partnerships that recognises the role of indigenous people from being ‘ researched ’ to ‘ researchers ’ [ 24 ] . Trust Trust is one of the important structures that under - pin good research practice and a crucial indicator for sound relationships in a research process [ 27 , 28 ] . As reported by Moodley and Singh [ 27 ] , colonialism and apartheid has perpetuated the lack of trust of scien - tists . The authors further point out that there is a need for a cultural revolution in health research which can be achieved through prioritising commu - nity engagement as a strategy to build trust in the research process . According to Liamputtong [ 28 ] , trust building between the researcher and the researched in a decolonising research process is vital and development thereof should be based on values of respect , reciprocity , collaboration and co - opera - tion . On the other hand , Abelson et al . [ 29 ] report that trust is one aspect that cannot be separated from vulnerability because the establishment of trust goes hand in hand with protecting the vulnerable against exploitation . For Boekraad [ 30 ] , trust can be estab - lished by both indigenous and non - indigenous researchers . The author further states that non - indi - genous researchers have played a positive role by engaging in productive and respectful research - related relationships based on trust . In other words , issues of trust and respect can therefore be estab - lished by indigenous and non - indigenous researchers who embraces these values in the research process . Culture and cultural competence The difficulties surrounding the definition of the term Cultural Competence ( CC ) have been highlighted by Kleinman and Benson [ 31 ] . For them , this term is not about knowledge and skills , nor about the ‘ do ’ s and don ’ ts ’ , because culture is not static and is not homo - genous . Others , such as Beavis et al . [ 7 ] , highlight that there is a need to think beyond cultural competence and GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION 3 to encourage critical consciousness when examining the social , political and historical issues . Some are of the view that continuous engagement with the researched can enable researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the culture and history of the study population [ 32 ] . For example , the first author ( Keikelame ) was invited by the chair of the Traditional Healers Organisation ( THO ) to attend provincial heritage celebrations . This invitation enabled her to learn some of the cultural ways through which the different traditional healers celebrate heritage , such as their styles of dancing and music . She jotted down the statement made by one of the key leaders of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa ( CONTRALESA ) : African researchers are the ones who can bring the true originality of the African traditional customs through their heritage … and heritage must not exclude culture , Ubuntu , nature and language . ( Personal communication , CONTRALESA leader , 12 May 2013 ) From this leader ’ s statement , we learned about some important aspects for consideration in a decolonising research process such as language , Ubuntu , culture , and respect for nature ( the physical world ) . Ubuntu refers to an African ethic of interdependence and relatedness . Within the precepts of Ubuntu , personhood is under - stood in relational terms , as seen in the aphorism ‘ A person is a person because of other people ’ . It stands in contrast to more individualistic ways of viewing person - hood . According to Khupe et al . [ 33 ] , research that is guided by Ubuntu can enhance trusting relationships and can also foster the notion of research ‘ with ’ the researched and not of research ‘ on ’ them . In terms of cultural heri - tage , Owusu - Ansa and Mji [ 34 ] reiterate that African scholars should be frontiers of their own cultural heritage and should engage in actions that empower and liberate Africans from poverty and social injustices of oppression . In our analysis of one of the stories of our partici - pants , we learned about the importance of paying atten - tion to cultural beliefs in the research process . One of our participants had concerns about the loss of blood records and the repeated drawing of blood , often with - out his or her knowledge of the kind of blood tests that were to be done and reasons for taking blood [ 35 ] . There are different rumours and myths about blood that have been reported , such as stealing of blood and spreading of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) [ 36 ] ; and some beliefs that blood is related to the psyche and demonic spirits [ 37 ] . We are of the view that when analysing participants ’ stories , it is important for researchers to bring to the fore these cultural issues and the meanings an interpretation attached to them . Writing about the importance of attending to issues of culture in a decolonising research , Tuhiwai - Smith [ 5 ] highlights that cultural beliefs , values , practices and norms should not be deemed as inhibitors of research . She emphasises that they should be an integral part of the indigenous research methodology and should be explicitly built into the methodology and reflected upon in a transparent way . This is quite important because , if these are ignored by the researchers , these may have an impact on the health outcomes of the researched or the research process itself . Respectful and legitimate research practice The importance of clearer guidelines for conducting research among indigenous people cannot be over - emphasised . According to Mohindra [ 15 , 38 ] , indi - genous research practices need to be scrutinised to ensure that they are culturally appropriate and ethi - cal for research conducted with and among indigen - ous people . Unethical research practices have been reported among the San people of southern Africa [ 39 ] . As a means to protect unethical practices among these groups , the South African San Institute and the leaders of the three San commu - nities of the ! Xun , Khwe and ! Khomani who repre - sent about 8000 people in South Africa developed the first San code of research ethics [ 39 , 40 ] . This code of ethics specifically highlights the four key ethical principles which underpin research among the San community : respect , honesty , justice and fairness , and care . It is envisaged that this code will ensure that the interests of the San communities are attended to by researchers [ 39 ] . Another critical issue reported in the San code of research is their concern about the use of scientific language . Similarly , in our project , we learned about the language barriers and how these may affect access to appropriate care and gaining informed consent to par - ticipate in research . During our recruitment phase , we faced challenges with our translated informed consent information leaflets which were translated by profes - sional Xhosa - speaking translators . We learned from our local field interpreters that our professionally translated forms were not in the everyday spoken Xhosa language and may not be fully understandable to research parti - cipants . Although these local interpreters may have fewer formal qualifications than these professional translators , they speak the everyday spoken language of the researched , and thus would be vital in translations of these research protocols – an important aspect for decolonising research methodologies [ 5 , 18 ] . Regarding respect , we learned about the impor - tance thereof in fostering collaboration between tra - ditional healers and biomedicals . However , the healers with whom we interacted were of the view that there were some biomedical professionals who are disrespectful of their indigenous knowledge . In the process , Keikelame invited a leader of the local traditional healers ’ organisation ( THO ) to attend a forum in which she presented findings from the 4 M . J . KEIKELAME AND L . SWARTZ interviews she had with them on their perspectives about epilepsy and collaboration with biomedicals . This leader openly raised concerns about exploitation of their indigenous knowledge in research : Our concerns with research is that , we [ traditional healers / leaders ] willingly share our knowledge about the indigenous plants that we use to treat illnesses , but after the information has been given to research - ers , we do not hear about the results and how plants have been processed into medicines ; we do not see our names on the labels of the medicine bottles of the plants we have provided … ( Traditional leader ) By contrast , we note from literature that there are some African scholars who reject working with these healers [ 41 ] . But Wreford , as cited in Bateman [ 42 , p . 81 ] , states that from her experience ‘ traditional healers are open to collaboration … but biomedicals tend to close the door on their understanding and biomedical and traditional sys - tems can work together in an inclusive and pragmatic way ’ . It is however , worthy of note that the emic and etic perspectives are always present in the research process . This is because the researchers ’ own values direct the research approach , design , implementation , analysis , interpretation and reporting of results [ Yin , 2010 cited in Olive , 43 ] . Recognition of individual and communities ’ assets One of the key lessons that we learned from our project is the importance of research to recognise the individual and community health assets . These assets are defined as any factors or resources which enhance the ability of individuals , communities and populations to maintain and sustain health and well - being and assist in reducing health inequalities – and can operate at the individual , family , community and societal levels [ 44 ] . Sweet et al . [ 45 ] point out that a decolonising process is about reor - ientation from problematising indigenous people to a focus on their strengths , capacities and resilience – to a proper process in which time and opportunities to develop relationships and trust are created . According to Vaandrager and Kennedy [ 46 ] , health assets are important resources which can foster individuals , com - munities and societies to engage in actions for social justice . In our project , we became aware of some of these assets at an individual level , such as self - advocacy , interpretation and networking skills . Here is an excerpt from Keikelame ’ s field notes : One of my participants showed me her story pub - lished in the local newspaper where she talked about the difficulties of caring for her disabled partner who has epilepsy in a poorly structured one roomed shack with no electricity , sanitation and water . On my second visit to this family , I found that as a result of this action , she was able to access a three - roomed house with basic needs . Conclusion and recommendations In this article , our aim was to share some of the lessons that we learned in our research process , and which we assume would be a useful contribution to informing the decolonising research methodologies process . Although we did not set out to use the indigenous methods per se , we found that on critical reflection from our different perspectives and orien - tations , we were able to gain insights into some of the important aspects that can be used to promote a culturally appropriate research practice . Our central argument in this article is that issues of power , trust , culture and cultural competence , respectful and legitimate research practice and recog - nition of individual and communities ’ assets are important structures to be considered in a decolonis - ing process . Drawing from Smith ’ s ( cited in Zavala [ 1 ] ) quotation in the introductory section of this article , we are of the view that the transformation of research can happen when the researched and the researchers are involved from the initial development of the identification of the research problem , devel - opment of the research proposal , design and metho - dology and implementation in all phases of the project . In addition , active participation of the researched can enable collective ownership , collective data analysis , collective presentation and communi - cation of findings [ 47 ] . We pointed out the impor - tance of recognition of assets as one of the lessons that we learned in our fieldwork which we deem may be useful for decolonising research . The Asset - Based Community Development ( ABCD ) approach has been reported as an approach that can strengthen individuals ’ and communities ’ capabilities to become resilient [ 44 , 48 ] . In terms of ethical issues in a decolonising process , Sabati [ 49 ] highlights that research ethics need to be reframed in a way that can foster active institutional commitments to shift resources and research practices to forms of knowledge that are anti - colonial and that these should be central to how researchers engage with ethical issues . Our lessons further show that indigenous and non - indigenous researchers need to critically reflect on issues of culture to ensure that research among the marginalised is ethically and culturally appropriate . As reported by Gray and Oprescu [ 50 ] , culturally appropri - ate research methods should be characterised by respect - ful relationships , open and respectful communication and dialogue . Regarding indigenous knowledge , we learn from Braun et al . [ 51 ] that research among indigenous people often discredits their knowledge due to views that indi - genous people are barbaric – and this may subject them to stigma , to vilifying their knowledge and using them as subjects of unethical practices as well as research . Despite this , we are of the view that a transformative process can GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION 5 address such negative attitudes and help to advance the understanding and the importance of indigenous knowl - edge in a decolonising research process . In conclusion , the importance of reflexivity and self - reflexivity as a transformative approach in a decolonis - ing process cannot be over emphasised . Stelmach [ 52 ] points out that non - Aboriginal researchers can engage in appropriate research if they turn the research ‘ focus inward ’ – by examining their own approaches through - out the research process , as well as the study design , interview questions , and data collection techniques , and by paying attention to their actual responses to partici - pants ’ comments . We are therefore of the view that even White researchers in our context can conduct appropri - ate research among the marginalised and vulnerable populations if they turn the research ‘ focus inward ’… as when the tortoise retracts its neck back into its shell . We trust that the lessons that we shared in this article will motivate other researchers to critically reflect on issues that may enhance a decolonising research process in the Global South and in our African context , and on how we , as researchers , can be empowered and trans - formed in the research process .
