Characterizing superspreading of SARS - CoV - 2 : from mechanism to measurement Zachary Susswein and Shweta Bansal Department of Biology , Georgetown University , Washington , D . C . 20057 , USA . December 8 , 2020 Abstract Superspreading is a ubiquitous feature of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynam - ics , with a few primary infectors leading to a large proportion of secondary infections . Despite the superspreading events observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks , the mechanisms behind the phenomenon are still poorly understood . Here , we show that superspreading is largely driven by heterogeneity in contact behavior rather than heterogeneity in susceptibility or infectivity caused by bi - ological factors . We ﬁnd that highly heterogeneous contact behavior is required to produce the extreme superspreading estimated from recent COVID - 19 out - breaks . However , we show that superspreading estimates are noisy and subject to biases in data collection and public health capacity , potentially leading to an overestimation of superspreading . These results suggest that superspreading for COVID - 19 is substantial , but less than previously estimated . Our ﬁndings highlight the complexity inherent to quantitative measurement of epidemic dy - namics and the necessity of robust theory to guide public health intervention . Introduction Heterogeneity in individual transmission is a critical feature of infectious disease dynamics , enabling explosive superspreading events . Although superspreading was identiﬁed during the HIV pandemic [ 1 ] , it is since the SARS - CoV - 1 out - break in 2002 - 2003 that superspreading has become a central focus of inves - tigation ; its large transmission clusters were not well - explained by traditional epidemic theory [ 2 , 3 ] and the public health response to curtail spread required a novel approach [ 4 , 5 ] . In the twenty years after the SARS - CoV - 1 outbreak , advances in theory have enabled quantitative description of superspreading po - tential , but disentangling the behavioral and biological mechanisms driving su - perspreading remains elusive and little attention has been paid to potential 1 .

Superspreading has been identiﬁed as key to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and understanding and accurately measuring superspreading are crucial for an informed public health response . A key insight in the theory of superspreading has been the deﬁnition of the oﬀspring distribution as a negative binomial random variable [ 6 ] . The oﬀspring distribution , describing the probability that an infected case will transmit to a given number of secondary cases , is quantiﬁed by a mean , R 0 , and a disper - sion statistic , k . Accurate measurement of the oﬀspring distribution enables quantitative description of the rate and manner of a pathogen’s spread . High values of the oﬀspring distribution’s dispersion statistic ( k > 5 ) suggest rela - tively homogeneous transmission . On the other hand , low values of k describe high variability in transmission , with most primary infections leading to few new cases and a few rare primary cases producing many secondary cases . This dispersion statistic has become widely used as a measure of superspreading po - tential , with values of k less than one indicating substantial superspreading [ 7 ] . Accurate computation and measurement of this dispersion statistic provides critical insight into the nature of pathogen transmission , informing actions as disparate as predictive modeling and public health control measures [ 7 , 8 ] . Oﬀ - spring distributions well - explained by low values of k correspond to the 80 - 20 rule , which posits that 80 % of new infections are attributable to 20 % of individ - uals [ 9 , 10 ] . Proposed control measures take advantage of this heterogeneity by preferentially targeting these individuals , for example by preventing public con - gregations and thereby preventing superspreading events [ 10 , 9 ] . Estimation of k ( and empirical adherence to the 80 - 20 rule ) can also guide resource allocation , with low values of k suggesting greater return on investment from contact tracing – limiting transmission by preventing superspreading events before they occur [ 11 ] . Models and simulation studies endorse the utility of targeting this high - transmission group , but emphasize the challenge presented by pre - symptomatic transmission ; isolation of symptomatic individuals and robust contact tracing may not be enough to control an outbreak if substantial transmission occurs before cases can be identiﬁed [ 12 ] . Superspreading is a function of heterogeneity in behavior and transmissibil - ity [ 6 , 13 ] . Human behavior can be variable across a population which can create disproportionate skews in disease transmission [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] . Similarly , between - individual variability in transmissibility , due to diﬀerences in susceptibility or shedding , can contribute to superspreading [ 17 , 3 ] . Here , we encapsulate these many sources of heterogeneity into two factors , behavior and biology . Behavior is driven by contact between individuals , with heterogeneity arising from varia - tion in age , occupation , social practices , environment , and the interaction type necessary for transmission , and leads to diﬀerences in numbers of contacts . We use “biology” to refer to diﬀerences in individual transmission competence ( i . e . transmissibility ) , with heterogeneity arising from variation in human physiology ( e . g . shedding or susceptibility ) , viral competence , and contact environment , among other factors . While these mechanisms contribute in complex ways to disease transmission dynamics , the relative contributions of behavior and biol - ogy to superspreading behavior are still largely unexamined , which limits the 2 .

During the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic there has been substantial interest in ac - curate measurement of the k statistic , quantifying the pathogen’s superspread - ing capability [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 15 ] . Large clusters of infections have been identiﬁed as a key feature of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , characteristic of superspreading behavior [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 19 , 24 ] . Matching these reports , many empirical estimates ﬁnd k to be quite low ( ∼ 0 . 1 - 0 . 4 ) , suggesting substantial heterogeneity in the SARS - CoV - 2 oﬀspring distribution [ 19 , 20 , 25 , 15 ] . Proposed control strategies take this heterogeneity into account , allowing for a potentially more eﬃcient public health response [ 26 , 13 , 20 , 27 ] . Here , we use a simple mechanistic model with behavior and transmissibil - ity parameterized at the individual level to understand how heterogeneity in transmission is aﬀected by variation in behavior versus transmissibility . Our results suggest that existing theory on the behavior that underlies the transmis - sion of respiratory infections , like SARS - CoV - 2 , cannot explain many empirical measurements of superspreading potential ( i . e . the k statistic ) . However , we show that methodological limitations and sampling errors could reduce the mea - sured value of the k statistic , resolving this discrepancy . We apply these results to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , re - examining several publicly available contact tracing datasets to estimate the superspreading potential of COVID - 19 , and demonstrate that superspreading occurs substantially , but at a lower rate than many empirical estimates ( i . e . higher k ) , consistent with theoretical results . Results Superspreading is driven by contact heterogeneity To clarify the independent role of behavior versus biology in superspreading , we consider how heterogeneity in either factor impacts the k statistic , while controlling R 0 . As expected , variation in contact structure ( as measured by the degree distribution ) or variation in shedding or susceptibility ( as measured by the transmissibility ) generates increased variation in transmission ( as mea - sured by the k statistic of the oﬀspring distribution ) ( Figure 1A ) . When there is heterogeneity in behavior alone , superspreading is observed but still not pro - nounced ( k ≥ 1 ) , with no observations at the extreme end of the empirically observed range ( k < 0 . 5 ) . Furthermore , equivalent levels of heterogeneity in transmissibility alone are not suﬃcient to produce superspreading ( k > 2 ) . ( See Appendix Figure S1 for univariate sensitivity analysis ) . When we consider the more realistic scenario of simultaneous heterogeneity in the degree distribution and transmissibility ( and allowing R 0 to vary ) , we ﬁnd that variation in the oﬀspring distribution is largely governed by varia - tion in contact rather than in transmissibility ( Figure 1B ) . This relationship is only weakly sensitive to the mean transmissibility or degree , while other epi - demic statistics , like the R 0 , are more sensitive to the means . The synergy of heterogeneity produced by both factors can result in moderate superspreading 3 .

Variation in contact structure alone ( i . e . behavior ) produces substantially more oﬀspring dispersion than variation in transmissibility alone . However , neither process alone can account for k < 1 . b ) When combined , heterogeneity in behavior and biol - ogy can produce superspreading in the range 0 . 5 ≤ k ≤ 1 , more than either process can alone . This superspreading behavior is largely governed by social contact patterns , with transmissibility only weakly modifying k . A power law degree distribution ( extreme contact variation ; dashed line ) is needed to produce k < 0 . 5 . 4 .

With 100 observed primary infections ( corresponding to 250 - 350 sec - ondary infections ) , point estimates have only a 50 % chance of being within 15 % of the true mean . b ) Conﬁdence interval coverage guarantees depend strongly on the conﬁdence interval method . The Wald interval does not match its cov - erage guarantees when the true k is small , even at large sample sizes . The non - parametric bootstrap method produces intervals that match the coverage guarantees regardless of sample size or true population k value . Dashed line indicates nominal 95 % coverage . ( 0 . 5 ≤ k ≤ 1 ) beyond what either factor produces separately , but only ex - treme contact heterogeneity ( a scale - free degree distribution ) achieves extreme superspreading ( k ≤ 0 . 5 ) . ( See Appendix S2 and S3 for bivariate sensitivity analysis ) . Our analysis also produces a functional relationship between the k statistic and the 80 % / 20 % rule ( Figure 2 ) , and we ﬁnd that values of k between 0 . 5 and 1 largely underestimate this proportion , instead leading to 60 - 70 % of sec - ondary infections caused by 20 % of primary cases . Indeed , we ﬁnd that the 80 % / 20 % rule is satisﬁed only with extreme variability in the oﬀspring distribu - tion ( k ≈ 0 . 3 ) . Past empirical results have found 80 % / 20 % rule adherence across a range of ˆ k estimates , both higher and lower than the theoretical relationships we demonstrate . We hypothesize that this discrepancy may be explained by variability in measurement and selection bias , and investigate this below . 6 .

We ﬁnd that even with true random samples at reasonably large sample sizes ( 200 primary cases , corresponding to roughly 500 - 1000 observed secondary cases ) , the point estimate of the k statistic ( ˆ k ) is often imprecise , with approximately 50 % of estimates not within 10 % of the true mean ( Figure 3A ) . Additionally , we ﬁnd that ˆ k is equally dispersed around the true population parameter , with standard error increasing with the magnitude of the true population k ( see Appendix Figure S4 ) . Therefore , larger population values of k can often produce small values of ˆ k , leading to overestimates of superspreading purely due to sampling variation . While conﬁdence intervals can ameliorate issues presented by noisy point estimates , the quality of conﬁdence interval coverage guarantees depends strongly on the method of estimation . In Figure 3B , we show that Wald conﬁdence intervals ( which assume convergence to normality ) perform poorly when the true k value is small – the scenario of interest for superspreading pathogens . Larger sample sizes improve the convergence rate , but when the true value of k is below 0 . 5 the coverage probability is still well below the nominal level . On the other hand , the non - parametric bootstrap method performs well across all the scenarios , with coverage closely approximating the nominal level . These results rely on the assumption of random sampling ; ˆ k can be biased downwards with respect to the true k ( i . e . overestimate superspreading ) if datasets demonstrating superspreading behavior are selectively used to quantify k , a bias magniﬁed by imperfect case observation ( like the data produced by contact tracing ; Appendix Figure S5 , Table S1 ) . We reanalyze publicly available contact tracing data from recent COVID - 19 contact tracing studies ( [ 19 , 29 , 30 , 28 ] ) , and ﬁnd that ˆ k estimates are sub - stantially above the consensus range of 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 ( Figure 4 ) . There is substantial variation across the ˆ k estimates , which vary in location , data collection prac - tices , and local stage of the epidemic , among other diﬀerences . Despite this variation , the majority of the estimates are in the range 0 . 5 ≤ ˆ k ≤ 1 . While the true bias in these estimates is unknowable , we also perform a minimal bias cor - rection ( Appendix Figure S5 , Table S1 ) , demonstrating that some of the most extreme estimates of k could overestimate superspreading . This bias correction is ad hoc and approximate – it should only be taken as an example of the po - tential magnitude of bias in the estimates . Even after the bias correction , the calculated range corresponds to substantial superspreading . Discussion The transmission of infectious agents within host populations is inﬂuenced by a number of sources of heterogeneity , including variation in behavior , immunology , physiology , and genetics . A consequence of such heterogeneity is disproportion - ate transmission dynamics in which a few hosts propagate pathogen eﬃciently , while the majority transmit ineﬃciently .

Such extreme levels of variation are not , however , supported by available behavioral or biological data . To explain this discrepancy , we consider how measurement biases may aﬀect the quantiﬁcation of superspreading potential from epidemiological data . Our mechanistic approach shows that superspreading can be reproduced through the combination of heterogeneity in social contact and heterogeneity in transmissibility across the population . While the combination of these simple phenomena is important to produce superspreading , the process is largely gov - erned by the amount of variation in social connectivity present in the population . The relationship between social contact and superspreading is remarkably ro - bust ; the relationship between transmissibility and superspreading is much more fragile . While variation in these factors is critical , superspreading ( estimation of k ) is largely robust to the transmissibility and degree means . However , as is well known , these means are key elements of epidemic spread , aﬀecting R 0 and the probability of an epidemic , among other important metrics . Our results indicate that variation in transmissibility alone , even when ex - treme variation , may fail to accurately describe superspreading . When rely - ing solely on variation in transmissibility , these descriptions are extraordinarily sensitive to the exact transmissibility parameterization and can easily produce unstable and unrealistic estimates ( for example : k > 5 ) . A population with variability in transmissibility but not behavior is analogous to a homogeneous - mixing compartmental model ( [ 14 ] ) , and superspreading inference from these homogeneous - mixing models should be treated with caution – their attempts to reproduce superspreading may be overly idealized . Indeed , careful empiri - cal modeling of SARS - CoV - 2 superspreading has emphasized the importance of social contact to accurate description [ 31 , 32 , 33 ] . The robust qualitative relationship between k and the amount of social con - tact variability in the population suggests empirical estimates of k can pro - vide information about the social contact network along which the pathogen spreads . Pathogens that exhibit little to no superspreading behavior theoreti - cally correspond to a population with little degree heterogeneity ( e . g . a Poisson degree distribution ) . A pathogen exhibiting minimal superspreading events ( i . e . 1 ≤ k ≤ 1 . 5 ) corresponds to a over - dispersed degree distribution , while one with substantial superspreading ( 0 . 5 < k < 1 ) corresponds to substantial degree vari - ability . We argue that extreme superspreading ( k ≤ 0 . 3 ) strongly supports a scale - free degree distribution . Past work has suggested that highly variable degree distributions may de - scribe the contact networks of sexually transmitted diseases , but may not be representative of respiratory disease contact networks [ 14 ] . Contact networks for respiratory transmission based on a contact deﬁnition of a face - to - face conver - sation of three or more words or physical contact are described by relatively ho - mogeneous degree distributions [ 34 , 35 ] . However , the ubiquity of superspread - ing behavior in the dynamics of respiratory - transmitted coronaviruses such as SARS - CoV - 1 , MERS , and SARS - CoV - 2 ( [ 2 , 36 , 19 , 37 , 24 ] ) , suggests that the 9 .

Such variability may result from complexity in contact deﬁnitions ( e . g . varying dura - tion of contact or cumulative contact periods ) or multiple transmission modes ( e . g . droplet and airborne ) driving transmission . The strong relationship be - tween population contact variability and superspreading points to unexplained mechanisms of transmission for coronaviruses . Future work to address this ques - tion is critical . As ﬁrst demonstrated in [ 6 ] , there is a robust relationship between quanti - tative estimates of superspreading ( the k statistic ) and adherence to the 80 / 20 rule , a scenario in which 80 % of all infections are caused by 20 % of infected individuals . Our ﬁrst - principles model is able to reproduce this relationship , demonstrating that adherence to the 80 / 20 rule implies quantiﬁcation of k ≈ 0 . 3 . These results imply that when datasets “satisfy” the 80 / 20 rule , they should likely produce estimates of k in the vicinity of 0 . 3 , as occurs empirically in [ 15 ] . The opposite is also true – estimates of k above 0 . 3 , while overdispersed , should not adhere to the 80 / 20 rule . The theory of the negative binomial oﬀspring distribution makes the prac - tice of quantifying superspreading potential from a dataset quite feasible , but the method itself is noisy and subject to bias – results should be interpreted with care . There are inherent methodological challenges in estimating a vari - ance parameter as it approaches an extremum ; the negative binomial dispersion parameter has been the subject of particular attention because of its relatively ﬂat likelihood , which makes accurate estimation and computation substantially more challenging [ 38 , 39 ] . The combination of noisy point estimates , poor con - ﬁdence interval coverage , and non - random sampling can produce overconﬁdent underestimates of the k dispersion parameter . For this reason , sources of bias and the full range of the bootstrap conﬁdence interval must be considered with care . Empirical estimation of k also suﬀers from inherent selection bias , with datasets chosen for analysis because they demonstrate superspreading events . This process , while well - intentioned , induces statistical ﬂaws , especially for small or only partially observed samples . The combination of several superspreading events into one larger dataset only compounds the issue ( Appendix Figure S6 ) . While ad hoc bias correction can help mitigate this source of bias , the best way to produce accurate estimates is to use large , rigorous samples as in [ 28 ] . In our empirical reanalysis , we ﬁnd k in the range of 0 . 5 to 1 for COVID - 19 , which indicates substantial superspreading , and agrees with some thorough empirical estimates [ 31 ] . However , there is notable variability in estimates of k , both across settings and within studies across multiple sites . This variation is to be expected ; at the time of observation , the municipality of Vo’ had a large portion of the population already infected and implemented strict social distancing procedures , likely altering estimates of k [ 30 ] . On the other hand , estimates of k in Indonesia are much lower , but should be interpreted with extreme caution . While the Indonesian study was conducted in the middle of uncontrolled epidemic growth , the naive R 0 estimates associated with the k esti - mation procedure were below 1 and tests to conﬁrm cases were scarce , especially 10 .

In addition , both [ 28 ] and [ 29 ] exhibit within - study heterogeneity in k estimates across geographic region and while these estimates are certainly inﬂuenced by variation in local public heath capacity , this hetero - geneity also suggests that local diﬀerences in population structure could alter superspreading rates ( as implied by [ 40 ] and [ 31 ] ) . Similarly , there were sub - stantial diﬀerences in numbers of tests and test positivity rate between Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh , potentially leading to biases in linelist inclusion [ 28 ] . Diﬀerences in factors such as public health interventions ( i . e . NPIs , social dis - tancing ) , local epidemic scale and spread , and linelist inclusion criteria , among others , could all contribute to the substantial unexplained diﬀerences between empirical superspreading estimates . These limitations point to the need for public availability of large - scale contact tracing datasets and a more thorough examination of biases in k estimation . Our results suggest that public health interventions meant to decrease the rate of superspreading events ( e . g . social distancing , bar closures ) may not materially alter measurements of superspreading ( i . e . k ) even though they are eﬀective at decreasing infection rates . These interventions are undoubtedly im - portant techniques in the public health arsenal , reducing rates of spread and total disease burden , and should be diligently applied and followed . However , a superspreading pathogen ( k < 1 ) is dependent on substantial contact het - erogeneity and even large reductions in contact heterogeneity are unlikely to decrease k by more than 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 when the initial k is less than 1 ; rapid decrease of k only occurs at smaller values of contact heterogeneity which do not produce much superspreading . For this reason , interventions such as social distancing may not meaningfully decrease measurements of k in superspreading diseases , even though they provide substantial beneﬁt through reduction in R 0 . Inter - ventions to decrease transmissibility ( e . g . mask wearing ) may also have limited impact on superspreading quantiﬁcation due to the insensitivity of k to trans - missibility . However , even though these interventions may not decrease k , they may decrease superspreading – because R 0 and k are dependent on each other , descriptors of the oﬀspring distribution , a reduction in R 0 even without a reduc - tion in k corresponds to smaller superspreading events . Indeed , superspreading pathogens are sensitive to mitigation strategies that preferentially prevent su - perspreading events , with reductions in behavioral variability providing superior reduction in R 0 [ 41 , 42 , 27 ] . Research on the impact of superspreading diseases to public health interventions is still an emerging ﬁeld , with substantial uncer - tainty remaining in how to best implement interventions . These results , based on theory and mathematical modeling , build upon on an extensive and rapidly growing literature on epidemic spread in complex sys - tems – an area of immediate public health concern . A strong understanding of heterogeneity in disease transmission dynamics is not only vital to the pub - lic health response to SARS - CoV - 2 , but also critical to the response to future epidemics . Disease spread is inﬂuenced by many diﬀerent sources of real - world heterogeneity ; understanding and accurately quantifying disease dynamics is impossible without robust development of epidemic theory . 11 .

In the net - work , nodes represent individuals , and edges between nodes represent potential disease - causing interaction ( e . g . shaking hands , a conversation in close proxim - ity ) . We represent the population as a random network with a speciﬁed degree distribution . Most of our analysis involves ( static ) random networks with a negative binomial degree distribution , parameterized with a mean and variance parameter which can be tuned to a speciﬁed index of dispersion ( i . e . variance to mean ratio ) . To understand edge cases , we also consider regular random networks ( in which all nodes have the same degree ) and scale - free random net - works ( in which the degree distribution is a power law ) . We generate random graphs of size N = 5000 in Python using the package “networkx” . All degree distributions are shifted such that the minimum degree is 1 , and all networks are constrained to be simple ( no self loops ) . We simulate disease transmission in a population based on the percolation Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered ( SIR ) model . Disease spreads on each network edge with a transmissibility , T , which is a probability of transmission between an infected and susceptible individuals [ 43 ] . We seed one index patient and al - low the infection to propagate until there are no infected individuals remaining . We classify an outbreak as an epidemic if a minimum of 5 % of the popula - tion is infected . We report the outcomes as an average across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations . We use the simpler SIR model over the more complicated Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered structure because the Exposed class alters the time to infectiousness for an individual but does not change the num - ber of infections per infector , which is the metric used for estimation of R 0 and k . For each set of Monte Carlo simulations , we record the oﬀspring distribu - tion at the second generation , and ﬁt a negative binomial distribution to the aggregated oﬀspring distribution of the epidemics using maximum likelihood estimation to get the mean ( R 0 ) and the dispersion statistic ( k ) of the distri - bution [ 38 ] . We also calculate the proportion of total infections due to the 20 % of individuals with the most realized infections in the oﬀspring distribution and the per - introduction probability of an epidemic . We consider two sets of experiments to understand the role of behavioral vs biological factors in generating superspreading . First , we alternatively assume variability in either behavior ( degree ) or biology ( transmissibility ) . To achieve this , we either assume negative binomial distributions for degree with a ﬁxed mean of 8 and a varying index of dispersion , and a constant transmissibility with E [ R 0 ] = 3 . Alternatively , we assume a homogeneous degree of 8 , and a heteroge - neous transmissibility parameterized by scaled negative binomial distributions so that the support is in [ 0 , 1 ] . Second , we simultaneously assume variability in degree and transmissibility , while allowing R 0 to vary within R 0 ∈ [ 1 , 5 ] . 12 .

For every combination of nega - tive binomial dispersion statistic , k ∈ { . 1 , . 2 , . . . , . 9 , 1 } , negative binomial mean , R 0 ∈ { 2 , 2 . 5 , . . . , 4 . 5 , 5 } , and sample size , N ∈ { 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 200 } , we draw neg - ative binomial samples , use maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters , ˆ R 0 and ˆ k , and generate the associated Wald and naive non - parametric bootstrap conﬁdence intervals for 100 Monte Carlo simulations . We follow the method employed in [ 38 ] , calculating the likelihood and associated statistics about k on the k − 1 scale . We also explore the eﬀect of non - random sampling and imperfect observa - tion on estimation of k . We simulate the impact of sample selection ( i . e . the practice of only choosing datasets exhibiting superspreading to estimate k ) in the presence of imperfect contact tracing . We generate samples from a negative binomial oﬀspring distribution with R 0 = 3 and k ∈ { 0 . 5 , . . . , 1 } with a binomial observation process with probability of observation p obs ∈ { 0 . 15 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 } . The resulting generative structure is : ν N ∼ NB ( µ , k ) Y N ∼ Bin ( ν N , p obs ) We use this structure to compute the average bias caused by selection ( i . e . non - random selection of samples ) if the true oﬀspring distribution k were in the range [ 0 . 5 , 1 ] , corresponding to substantial but not extreme superspreading . This average eﬀect is not evidence for bias ; rather , it is an estimation of the direction and magnitude of this potential bias if it were occurring . Analysis of contact tracing datasets Using publicly released COVID contact tracing datasets [ 19 , 29 , 30 , 28 ] , we calculate the dispersion parameter k using maximum likelihood estimation and associated 95 % conﬁdence intervals using the non - parametric bootstrap . We apply the ad hoc bias correction for p obs = 0 . 15 from the previous section to the estimates . We process and analyze the datasets in R using the package ‘ﬁtdistrplus’ .
