Lattice models in micromechanics Martin Ostoja - Starzewski Department of Mechanical Engineering , McGill University , 817 Sherbrooke St West , Montre´al , Que´bec , Canada H3A 2K6 ; martin . ostoja @ mcgill . ca This review presents the potential that lattice ~ or spring network ! models hold for micromechan - ics applications . The models have their origin in the atomistic representations of matter on one hand , and in the truss - type systems in engineering on the other . The paper evolves by ﬁrst giving a rather detailed presentation of one - dimensional and planar lattice models for classical continua . This is followed by a section on applications in mechanics of composites and key computational aspects . We then return to planar lattice models made of beams , which are a discrete counterpart of non - classical continua . The ﬁnal two sections of the paper are devoted to issues of connectivity and rigidity of networks , and lattices of disordered ~ rather than peri - odic ! topology . Spring network models offer an attractive alternative to ﬁnite element analyses of planar systems ranging from metals , composites , ceramics and polymers to functionally graded and granular materials , whereby a ﬁber network model of paper is treated in consider - able detail . This review article contains 81 references . @ DOI : 10 . 1115 / 1 . 1432990 # INTRODUCTION Lattice ~ or spring network ! models are based , in principle , on the atomic lattice models of materials . These models work best when the material may naturally be represented by a system of discrete units interacting via springs , or , more gen - erally , rheological elements . It is not surprising that spatial trusses and frameworks have been the primary material sys - tems thus modeled . In the case of granular media , the lattice methods are called discrete element models . Spring networks can also be used to model continuum systems by a lattice much coarser than the true atomic one—the idea dates back , at least , to Hrennikoff @ 1 # , if not to Maxwell @ 2 # in a special setting of optimal trusses . This coarse lattice idea obviates the need to work with the enormously large number of de - grees of freedom that would be required in a true lattice model , and allows a very modest number of nodes per single heterogeneity ~ eg , inclusion in a composite , or grain in a polycrystal ! . As a result , spring networks are a close relative of the much more widespread ﬁnite element method . In this paper , we focus on basic concepts and applications of spring networks , in particular , to anti - plane elasticity , pla - nar classical elasticity , and planar micropolar elasticity . Two settings of such models are elaborated in some detail : peri - odic lattices and those with disordered topologies . We also indicate connections with other , related studies such as ge - neric rigidity in the ﬁeld of structural topology . Additionally , an adaptation of lattice methods to modeling crack propaga - tion are presented . This spring network models are sufﬁ - ciently general to apply to systems ranging from metals , composites , ceramics and polymers to functionally graded and granular materials . The most extensive example treated here is that of mechanics of paper from the standpoint of a disordered network of cellulose , beam - type ﬁbers . 1 ONE - DIMENSIONAL LATTICES 1 . 1 Simple lattice and elastic string Let us ﬁrst consider a lattice - based derivation of a wave equation for a one - dimensional ~ 1D ! chain of particles ; see also @ 3 # . The particles ~ parametrized by i ! , each of mass m i , interact via nearest - neighbor springs , Fig . 1 . For the potential and kinetic energies we ﬁnd U 5 1 2 ( i F i ~ u i 1 1 2 u i ! 5 1 2 ( i K ~ u i 1 1 2 u i ! 2 T 5 1 2 ( i mu˙ i 2 ( 1 . 1 ) where F i 5 K ( u i 1 1 2 u i ) is the axial force at i , and K is the spring constant between i and i 1 1 . Using the Euler - Lagrange equations for the Lagrangian L 5 T 2 U , we arrive at the dynamical equations K ~ u i 1 1 2 2 u i 1 u i 2 1 ! 5 mu¨ i ( 1 . 2 ) which describe a system of coupled oscillators . By taking a Taylor expansion up to the second derivative for the dis - placement u i 6 1 [ u ( x i 6 s ) , u i 6 1 > u u x i 6 u , x u x i s 1 1 2 ! u , xx U x i s 2 ( 1 . 3 ) Transmitted by Associate Editor RB Hetnarski ASME Reprint No AMR320 $ 22 . 00 Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 © 2002 American Society of Mechanical Engineers 35 we ﬁnd from Eq . ~ 1 . 2 ! an approximating continuum mechan - ics model , ie , a basic wave equation EAu , xx 5 r Au¨ ( 1 . 4 ) where ~ A being the cross - sectional area of the rod ! E 5 Ks A r 5 m As . ( 1 . 5 ) Of course , Eq . ~ 1 . 4 ! can also be obtained from the Hamil - ton’s principle for the Lagrangian L expressed in terms of continuum - like quantities , by ﬁrst introducing Eq . ~ 1 . 3 ! in ( 1 . 1 ) 1 with terms up to the ﬁrst derivative , U 5 AE 2 E 0 d ~ u , x ! 2 dx T 5 A r 2 E 0 d ~ u˙ ! 2 dx . ( 1 . 6 ) 1 . 2 Micropolar lattice and elastic beam We now generalize the preceding lattice model to describe transverse motions of a 1D chain of dumbbell particles ~ rigid bars ! pin - connected by central - force ~ axial ! springs , Fig . 2 . We need to consider two degrees of freedom per particle i : total transverse displacement w i and rotation w i . The consti - tutive laws for a single bay ~ between i and i 1 1 ! are F˜ i 5 K ’ ~ w i 1 1 2 w i 2 s w i 1 1 ! M i 52 K & ~ w i 1 1 2 w i ! . ( 1 . 7 ) Here F˜ i is shear force and M i is bending moment at i , whereby the term w i 1 1 s is subtracted in Eq . ( 1 . 7 ) 1 to so as to deal with shear only . For this 1D chain of particles , we write down potential and kinetic energies U 5 1 2 ( i K ’ @ w i 1 1 2 w i 2 s w i 1 1 # 2 1 K & ~ w i 1 1 2 w i ! 2 T 5 1 2 ( i mw˙ i 2 1 J w ˙ i 2 . ( 1 . 8 ) The ﬁrst term in Eq . ( 1 . 8 ) 1 accounts for shear deformations , while the second for bending . Using the Euler - Lagrange equations for the Lagrangian L 5 T 2 U , we obtain a system of equations K ’ @ w i 1 1 2 2 w i 1 w i 2 1 2 s ~ w i 1 1 2 w i ! # 5 mw¨ i K & @ w i 1 1 2 2 w i 1 w i 2 1 # 1 K ’ @ w i 1 1 2 w i 2 1 2 s w i # s 5 J w ¨ i . ( 1 . 9 ) By introducing the Taylor expansions for w i and w i in Eq . ( 1 . 9 ) 1 with terms up to the second derivative , and taking the limit s ! 0 , we ﬁnd GA @ w , x 2 w # , x 5 r Aw¨ EI w , xx 1 GA @ w , x 2 w # 5 r I w ¨ ( 1 . 10 ) where ~ A and I being the area and second moment of cross - section of the beam - like lattice ! G 5 K ’ s A r 5 m As I 5 JA m E 5 K & sm JA . ( 1 . 11 ) Equations ~ 1 . 10 ! are recognized as the equations of a Ti - moshenko beam . Evidently , this is a 1D micropolar con - tinuum with two degrees of freedom : displacement w and rotation w . As in Section 1 . 1 , Eq . ~ 1 . 10 ! could alternatively be ob - tained by ﬁrst introducing Taylor series with terms up to the ﬁrst derivative into Eq . ~ 1 . 8 ! to ﬁrst get U 5 1 2 E 0 d @ GA ~ w , x ! 2 1 EI ~ w , x ! 2 # dx T 5 1 2 E 0 d @ A r ~ w˙ ! 2 1 I r ~ w ˙ ! 2 # dx ( 1 . 12 ) and then , by employing the Hamilton’s principle . A question arises here : Can other , more complex ~ micro ! structures , especially those made of little beams connected by rigid joints , of a general beam - like geometry - such as shown in Fig . 3 be sufﬁciently well described by this beam model ? The general answer is no . ~ see eg , @ 4 # ! . The basic procedure , however , recommended by that author is basically the same as that outlined here : 1 ! the equivalent micropolar beam model is set up from the postulate of the same strain and kinetic energies stored in the original lattice when both are deformed identically ; 2 ! a typical repeating element is identiﬁed and the energies for this element are expressed in terms of the nodal dis - placements , joint rotations , as well as the geometric and material properties of the individual members ; 3 ! a passage to an effective continuum is carried out via a Taylor expansion , whereby it turns out that higher - order terms show up in the governing continuum equations , de - pending on the actual microgeometry of the rods making up the structure ; see also @ 5 # . It is appropriate to note here that beam - like lattices can also be analyzed by a cell transfer matrix approach—the eigen - values of this matrix are the decay rates relevant in the Saint - Venant’s principle for these discrete , rather than continuum , systems @ 6 # . The associated eigenvectors and principal vec - tors lead to equivalent continuum - beam properties . We end by noting that continuum approximations of plate - like struc - tures were also investigated @ 7 # . In that review , among the problems needing new investigations was also listed the ef - fect of microstructural material randomness .

We need then to consider a coupling between the axial force F and torque M on one hand , and the axial strain « and rotational strain b 5 R t S on the other , that is F 5 C 11 « 1 C 12 b M 5 C 21 « 1 C 22 b . ( 1 . 13 ) Here , from a requirement of a positive strain energy density , we obtain two conditions on four constitutive coefﬁcients C ij C 11 . 0 C 22 . 0 C 12 5 C 21 C 11 C 22 2 C 12 C 21 . 0 . ( 1 . 14 ) In the language of continuum mechanics , the wire rope is a 1D micropolar medium of a noncentrosymmetric type . In studies of 2D and 3D models of such continua these terms are also used : hemitropic , antisymmetric , or chiral composite @ 9 , 10 # . Interestingly , while the Timoshenko beam involved a shear force and a moment normal to the beam’s axis , and also mutually orthogonal , in the present model the axial force and moment are parallel to the main axis . It is important to note that Eqs . ~ 1 . 13 ! apply to other physical systems than a wire rope , for example : i ! a wood ﬁber made of helically wound ﬁbrils , and ii ! a simple helix . Indeed , description ~ 1 . 13 ! holds , regardless of whether the derivation of the C ij coefﬁcients is made from the standpoint of a theory of a bundle of wires or a continuum shell . Indeed , it was shown , in the context of structural mechanics @ 11 # , that either assumption would lead to a few percent difference ~ at most ; 11 % ! for any of these coefﬁcients . It remains to be seen , however , what those differences would be for a shell made of a large number of thin cellulose ﬁbrils winding along the axis of a cellulose ﬁber rather than a few thick wires such as shown in Fig . 4 . The constitutive equations ~ 1 . 13 ! in combination with the balance equations led Samras et al @ 12 # to derive a system of two coupled wave equations governing the axial - twisting re - sponse of a ﬁber C 11 u , xx 1 C 12 w , xx 5 r u¨ C 21 u , xx 1 C 22 w , xx 5 J w ¨ ( 1 . 15 ) where r is the mass density and J is the mass polar moment of inertia . These authors considered a monochromatic wave propagation along the ﬁber u ~ x , t ! 5 U exp @ ik ~ x 2 ct ! # w ~ x , t ! 5 F exp @ ik ~ x 2 ct ! # ( 1 . 16 ) and arrived at a dispersion relation resulting in two wave speeds c 1 , 2 5 2 ~ C 11 C 22 2 C 12 C 21 ! ~ C 11 J 1 C 22 r ! 6 @ ~ C 11 J 2 C 22 r ! 2 1 4 r JC 12 C 21 # 1 / 2 . ( 1 . 17 ) It followed , by inspection , that c 1 , c 2 , and , in fact , there may be an order of magnitude difference between both wave speeds . In view of Eq . ~ 1 . 16 ! , axial vibrations of the ﬁber are described by two types of waves—slow and fast—each of which consists of forward and backward going pulses Fig . 3 Planar lattices and their repeating elements ~ after Noor and Nemeth @ 4 # !

( 1 . 18 ) Next , by considering the ratio of axial to torsional ampli - tudes U / F , they concluded that the waves that are primarily axial in nature ( U / F . 1 ) propagate at speeds c 2 , while the waves that are primarily torsional in nature ( U / F , 1 ) propagate at speeds c 1 . Clearly , by assuming C 12 5 C 21 5 0 one immediately arrives at two uncoupled wave equations for purely axial and torsional waves , respectively . 2 PLANAR SPRING NETWORKS ON PERIODIC LATTICES : CLASSICAL CONTINUA 2 . 1 Basic idea of a spring network representation As already demonstrated in the setting of 1D models , the basic idea in setting up the spring network models is based on the equivalence of strain energy stored in a unit cell ~ Fig . 5 ! , of volume V , of a network U cell 5 U continuum . ( 2 . 1 ) The unit cell is a periodically repeating part of the network . Two aspects should be noted here : 1 ! the choice of the unit cell may be non - unique , see Fig 5 ; 2 ! the inner structure of the unit cell is not necessarily ‘nicely’ ordered—it may be of a disordered microgeom - etry , with an understanding that it repeats itself in space . In Eq . ~ 2 . 1 ! the energies of the cell and its continuum equivalent , respectively , are U cell 5 ( b E b 5 1 2 ( b N b ~ F (cid:149) u ! ~ b ! U continuum 5 1 2 E V s (cid:149) « dV . ( 2 . 2 ) The superscript b in ( 2 . 2 ) 1 stands for the b - th spring ~ bond ! , and N b for the total number of bonds . Our discussion is set in the two - dimensional ~ 2D ! setting so that , by a volume we actually mean an area of unit thickness . In the sequel we restrict ourselves to linear elastic springs and spatially linear displacement ﬁelds u ~ ie , uniform strain ﬁelds « ! , so that Eq . ~ 2 . 2 ! will become U cell 5 1 2 ( b N b ~ k u (cid:149) u ! ~ b ! U continuum 5 1 2 « (cid:149) C (cid:149) « ( 2 . 3 ) In Eq . ~ 2 . 3 ! u is a generalized spring displacement and k its corresponding spring constant . The next step , that will depend on the particular geometry of the unit element and on the particular model of interactions , will involve making a connection between u and « , and then deriving C from Eq . ~ 2 . 1 ! . The corresponding procedures and resulting formulas are given below for several elasticity problems set in the square and triangular network geometries . 2 . 2 Anti - plane elasticity on square lattice Of all the elasticity problems , the anti - plane one is the sim - plest on which to illustrate the spring network idea . In the continuum setting , we thus have the constitutive law s i 5 C ij « j i , j 5 1 , 2 ( 2 . 4 ) where s 5 ( s 1 , s 2 ) [ ( s 310 , s 320 ) and « 5 ( « 1 , « 2 ) [ ( « 310 , « 320 ) . Upon substitution into the momentum balance law s i , i 5 0 , ( 2 . 5 ) we obtain ~ C ij u , j ! , i 5 0 . ( 2 . 6 ) Henceforth , we are interested in approximations of locally homogeneous media , so that the governing equation be - comes C ij u , ij 5 0 ( 2 . 7 ) In the special case of an isotropic medium Eq . ~ 2 . 7 ! simpli - ﬁes to a Laplace equation Cu , ii 5 0 . ( 2 . 8 ) We now discretize the material with a square lattice net - work , Fig . 5 a , whereby each node has one degree of freedom Fig . 5 a ! A hexagonal lattice with three different choices of unit cell ; b ! a square lattice with a square unit cell ; and c ! a triangular lattice with hexagonal unit cell 38 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 ~ anti - plane displacement u ! , and nearest neighbor nodes are connected by springs of constant k . It follows that the strain energy of a unit cell of such a lattice is U 5 1 2 k ( b 5 1 4 l i ~ b ! l j ~ b ! « i « j . ( 2 . 9 ) In the above , we employed the uniform strain « 5 ( « 1 , « 2 ) . Also , l ( b ) 5 ( l 1 ( b ) , l 2 ( b ) ) is the vector of half - length of bond b . In view of Eq . ~ 2 . 1 ! , the stiffness tensor is obtained as C ij 5 k V ( b 5 1 4 l i ~ b ! l j ~ b ! i , j 5 1 , 2 ( 2 . 10 ) where V 5 4 if all the bonds are of unit length ( u l ( b ) u 5 1 ) . This leads to a relation between the bond spring constant k and the C ij tensor C 11 5 C 22 5 k 2 C 12 5 C 21 5 0 . ( 2 . 11 ) In order to model an orthotropic medium , different bonds are applied in the x 1 and x 2 directions : k ( 1 ) and k ( 2 ) . The strain energy of a unit cell is now U 5 1 2 ( b 5 1 4 k ~ b ! l i ~ b ! l j ~ b ! « ¯ i « ¯ j ( 2 . 12 ) so that the stiffness tensor is C ij 5 1 V ( b 5 1 4 k ~ b ! l i ~ b ! l j ~ b ! ( 2 . 13 ) which leads to relations C 11 5 k ~ 1 ! 2 C 22 5 k ~ 2 ! 2 C 12 5 C 21 5 0 . ( 2 . 14 ) If one wants to model an anisotropic medium ~ ie , with C 12 (cid:222) 0 ! , one may either choose to rotate its principal axes to coincide with those of the square lattice and use the network model just described , or introduce diagonal bonds k ( 5 ) and k ( 6 ) oriented along ~ 1 , 1 ! and ~ 1 , 2 1 ! directions , respectively . In the latter case , the unit cell energy is given by the formula ~ 2 . 12 ! with N b 5 8 . The expressions for C ij ’s are C 11 5 k ~ 1 ! 2 1 k ~ 5 ! C 22 5 k ~ 2 ! 2 1 k ~ 6 ! C 12 5 C 21 5 k ~ 5 ! 2 k ~ 6 ! . ( 2 . 15 ) It will become clear in the next section how this model can be modiﬁed to a triangular spring network geometry . 2 . 3 In - plane elasticity : Triangular lattice with central interactions In the planar continuum setting , which is discussed in some more detail in the Appendix , the isotropic Hooke’s law s ij 5 C ijkm « km i , j , k , m 5 1 , 2 ( 2 . 16 ) upon substitution into the balance law s ij , j 5 0 ( 2 . 17 ) results in planar Navier’s equation for the displacement u i m u i , jj 1 k u j , ji 5 0 . ( 2 . 18 ) In Eq . ~ 2 . 18 ! , m is deﬁned by s 12 5 m« 12 , which makes it the same as the classical 3D shear modulus . On the other hand , k is the ~ planar ! 2D bulk modulus , that is deﬁned by s ii 5 k« ii . As in the foregoing section , we are interested in approxi - mations of locally homogeneous media . Consider a regular triangular network of Fig . 5 b with central force interactions only , which are described , for each bond b , by F i 5 F ij ~ b ! u j where F ij ~ b ! 5 a ~ b ! n i ~ b ! n j ~ b ! . ( 2 . 19 ) Similar to the case of anti - plane elasticity , a ( b ) is the spring constant of half - lengths of such central ~ normal ! interactions , ie , of those parts of the springs that lie within the given unit cell . The unit vectors n ( b ) at respective angles u ( b ) of the ﬁrst three a springs are u ~ 1 ! 5 0° n 1 ~ 1 ! 5 1 n 2 ~ 1 ! 5 0 u ~ 2 ! 5 60° n 1 ~ 2 ! 5 1 2 n 2 ~ 2 ! 5 ) 2 u ~ 3 ! 5 120° n 1 ~ 3 ! 52 1 2 n 2 ~ 3 ! 5 ) 2 . ( 2 . 20 ) The other three springs ( b 5 4 , 5 , 6 ) must , by the requirement of symmetry with respect to the center of the unit cell , have the same properties as b 5 1 , 2 , 3 , respectively . All the a - springs are of length l , that is , the spacing of the triangular mesh is s 5 2 l . The cell area is V 5 2 ) l 2 . Every node has two degrees of freedom , and it follows that the strain energy of a unit hexagonal cell of such a lattice , under conditions of uniform strain « 5 ( « 11 , « 22 , « 12 ) , is U 5 l 2 2 ( b 5 1 6 a ~ b ! n i ~ b ! n j ~ b ! n k ~ b ! n m ~ b ! « ij « km ( 2 . 21 ) so that , again by Eq . ~ 2 . 1 ! , the stiffness tensor becomes C ijkm 5 l 2 V ( b 5 1 6 a ~ b ! n i ~ b ! n j ~ b ! n k ~ b ! n m ~ b ! . ( 2 . 22 ) In particular , taking all a ( b ) the same , we see that C 1111 5 C 2222 5 9 8 ) a C 1122 5 C 2211 5 3 8 ) a C 1212 5 3 8 ) a ( 2 . 23 ) so that there is only one independent elastic modulus , and the modeled continuum is isotropic . It is important to note here that the isotropy follows from the triangular lattice having an axis of symmetry of the sixth order . This , combined with the fact that Eq . ~ 2 . 22 ! satisﬁes the conditions of Cauchy symmetry @ 13 # with respect to the permutations of all the four indices C ijkm 5 C ijmk 5 C jikm 5 C kmij 5 C ikjm ( 2 . 24 ) implies that C ijkm is of the form Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics 39 C ijkm 5 l ~ d ij d km 1 d ik d jm 1 d im d jk ! . ( 2 . 25 ) In view of ~ 2 . 23 ! , we obtain the classical Lame´ constants l 5 m 5 3 4 ) a . ( 2 . 26 ) One might try to model anisotropy by considering three different a ’s in Eq . ~ 2 . 21 ! , but such an approach would be limited—one needs to have six parameters in order to freely adjust any planar anisotropy which involves six independent C ijkm ’s . This can be achieved by introducing the additional angular springs as discussed below . In fact , angular springs are also the device to vary the Poisson’s ratio . 2 . 4 In - plane elasticity : Triangular lattice with central and angular interactions We continue with the triangular network , and introduce an - gular springs acting between the contiguous bonds incident onto the same node . These are assigned spring constants b ( b ) , and , again by the argument of symmetry with respect to the center of the unit cell , only three of those can be inde - pendent . Thus , we arrive at six spring constants : $ $ a ( 1 ) , a ( 2 ) , a ( 3 ) , b ( 1 ) , b ( 2 ) , b ( 3 ) % . With reference to Fig . 6 b , let Du ( b ) be the ~ inﬁnitesimal ! angle change of the b - th spring orientation from the undeformed position . Noting that , n 3 n 5 l Du , we obtain Du k ~ b ! 5 e kij « jp n i n p i , j , p 5 1 , 2 ( 2 . 27 ) where e kij is the Levi - Civita permutation tensor . Since k 5 3 , we can simply write Du ( b ) for Du k ( b ) . The angle change between two contiguous a springs ~ b and b 1 1 ! is then mea - sured by Df 5 Du ( b 1 1 ) 2 Du ( b ) , so that the energy stored in the spring b ( b ) is E ~ b ! 5 12 b ~ b ! u Df u 2 5 12 b ~ 2 ! $ « kij « jp ~ n i ~ b 1 1 ! n p ~ b 1 1 ! 2 n i ~ b ! n p ~ b ! ! % 2 . ( 2 . 28 ) By superposing the energies of all the angular bonds with the energy ~ 2 . 21 ! , the elastic moduli are derived as @ 14 # C ijkm 5 l 2 V ( b 5 1 6 a ~ b ! n i ~ b ! n j ~ b ! n k ~ b ! n m ~ b ! 1 1 V ( b 5 1 6 $ ~ b ~ b ! 1 b ~ b 2 1 ! ! d ik n p ~ b ! n j ~ b ! n p ~ b ! n m ~ b ! 2 ~ b ~ b ! 1 b ~ b 2 1 ! ! n i ~ b ! n j ~ b ! n k ~ b ! n m ~ b ! 2 b ~ b ! d ik n p ~ b ! n j ~ b 1 1 ! n p ~ b 1 1 ! n m ~ b ! 1 b ~ b ! n i ~ b ! n j ~ b 1 1 ! n k ~ b 1 1 ! n m ~ b ! 2 b ~ b ! d ik n p ~ b ! n j ~ b ! n p ~ b 1 1 ! n m ~ b 1 1 ! 1 b ~ b ! n i ~ b 1 1 ! n j ~ b ! n k ~ b ! n m ~ b 1 1 ! % ( 2 . 29 ) where b 5 0 is the same as b 5 6 . This provides the basis for a spring network representation of an anisotropic material ; it also forms a generalization of the so - called Kirkwood model @ 15 # of an isotropic material . The latter is obtained by assign - ing the same a to all the normal and the same b to all the angular springs C ijkm 5 a 2 ) ( b 5 1 6 n i ~ b ! n j ~ b ! n k ~ b ! n m ~ b ! 1 b 2 ) l 2 ( b 5 1 6 $ 2 d ik n j ~ b ! n m ~ b ! 2 2 n i ~ b ! n j ~ b ! n k ~ b ! n m ~ b ! 2 d ik n p ~ b ! n j ~ b 1 1 ! n p ~ b 1 1 ! n m ~ b ! 1 n i ~ b ! n j ~ b 1 1 ! n k ~ b 1 1 ! n m ~ b ! 2 d ik n p ~ b ! n j ~ b ! n p ~ n 1 1 ! n m ~ b 1 1 ! 1 n i ~ b 1 1 ! n j ~ b ! n k ~ b ! n m ~ b 1 1 ! % .

( 2 . 34 ) For the subrange of Poisson’s ratio between 2 1 / 3 and 1 / 3 one may also use a Keating model @ 17 # which employs a different calculation of the energy stored in angular bonds . 2 . 5 Triple honeycomb lattice It is recalled from Section 2 . 4 that 1 / 3 is the highest Pois - son’s ratio of central - force triangular lattices with one spring constant . An interesting model permitting higher values , from 1 / 3 up to 1 , was introduced in @ 18 , 19 # . The model sets up three honeycomb lattices , having spring constants a , b , and g , respectively , overlapping in such a way that they form a single triangular lattice , Fig . 7 . The planar bulk and shear moduli of a single phase are k 5 1 A 12 ~ a 1 b 1 g ! m 5 A 27 16 S 1 a 1 1 b 1 1 g D 2 1 . ( 2 . 35 ) In the case of two or more phases , a spring that crosses a boundary between any two phases 1 and 2 is assigned a spring constant according to a series rule a 5 @ ( 2 a 1 ) 2 1 1 ( 2 a 2 ) 2 1 # , where a i is a spring constant of the respective phase . 3 APPLICATIONS IN MECHANICS OF COMPOSITES 3 . 1 Representation by a ﬁne mesh In order to solve the ﬁeld equations of a two - phase compos - ite we employ a spring network method , Fig . 8 a . The idea is to approximate the planar , piecewise - constant continuum by a very ﬁne mesh . In the following , we shall assume that a square mesh in the x 1 , x 2 - plane for discretization of anti - plane displacement ﬁeld u [ u 3 is used . The governing equa - tions are u ~ i , j ! @ k r 2 k l 1 k u 1 k d # 2 u ~ i 1 1 , j ! k r 2 u ~ i 2 1 , j ! k l 2 u ~ i , j 1 1 ! k u 2 u ~ i , j 2 1 ! k d 5 f ~ i , j ! ( 3 . 1 ) where f ( i , j ) is the body force ~ or source ! at the point ( i , j ) , while i and j are the coordinates of mesh points , and k r , k l , k u and k d are deﬁned from the series spring model k r 5 @ 1 / C ~ i , j ! 1 1 / C ~ i 1 1 , j ! # 2 1 k l 5 @ 1 / C ~ i , j ! 1 1 / C ~ i 2 1 , j ! # 2 1 k u 5 @ 1 / C ~ i , j ! 1 1 / C ~ i , j 1 1 ! # 2 1 k d 5 @ 1 / C ~ i , j ! 1 1 / C ~ i , j 2 1 ! # 2 1 . ( 3 . 2 ) In Eq . ~ 3 . 2 ! , C ( i , j ) is the property at ~ i , j ! . This type of a discretization is equivalent to a ﬁnite dif - ference method that would be derived by considering the expansions Fig . 7 a !

( 3 . 4 ) However , in the case of in - plane elasticity problems , a spring network approach is not identical to a ﬁnite difference method , as the node - node connections of a spring network do really have a meaning of springs , whereas the ﬁnite dif - ference connections do not . In the case of a composite made of two locally isotropic phases : matrix ~ m ! and inclusions ~ i ! , the Hooke’s law is s i 5 C ij « j i , j 5 1 , 2 C ij 5 C ~ m ! d ij or C ~ i ! d ij . ( 3 . 5 ) The above leads to a so - called contrast C ( i ) / C ( m ) , sometimes also called a mismatch . It is clear that by increasing the con - trast we can approximately model materials with rigid inclu - sions . Similarly , by decreasing the contrast , we go to very soft inclusions and nearly reach a system with holes . While the disk is the most basic inclusion shape when dealing with composites , a departure from this is of interest . Thus , another basic parameter specifying the composite is the aspect ratio of ellipses a / b , where a ( b ) is the major ~ minor ! semi - axis . By varying the aspect ratio from 1 up through higher values , we can model systems having disk - type , ellipse - type , through needle - type inclusions . We are thus led to the concept of a parameter plane as shown in Fig . 8 a . Resolution of several different types of inclusions by a spring network is shown in Fig . 8 b . That is , we can model disks , ellipses , needles , etc . Admittedly , this type of model - ing is approximate so that a somewhat different interpreta - tion of a parameter plane is given in Fig . 8 c . It is seen that disks may most simply be modeled as single pixels or more accurately as ﬁnite regions ; in the latter case arbitrary anisotropies can be modeled . The former case allows one to deal with very large scale systems , while the latter allows a much better resolution of local stress / strain ﬁelds within and around the inclusions . By decreasing the spring network mesh size , an increasingly better accuracy can be achieved . Somewhat more accurate results may be obtained by a ﬁnite element model , albeit at a higher price of costly and cumber - some remeshing for each and every new disk conﬁguration B ( v ) which is required in statistical studies . It is noteworthy that , in contradistinction to a ﬁnite ele - ment method , no need for remeshing and constructing of a stiffness matrix exists in our spring network method : spring constants are very easily assigned throughout the mesh , and the conjugate gradient method ﬁnds the solution of the equi - librium displacement ﬁeld u ( i , j ) . In that manner , a system having 10 6 million degrees of freedom ~ 1000 3 1000 nodes ! can readily be handled on a computer workstation with ; 90MB of random access memory . For 2000 3 2000 nodes , one requires some 360MB , and so on , because of a linear scaling of memory requirements with the number of degrees of freedom . The quality of approximation of ellipses and needle - type cracks / inclusions can be varied according to the number of nodes chosen to represent such objects . Local ﬁelds cannot be perfectly resolved—boundary elements may be better suited for this—but the solution by the spring network is sufﬁcient to rapidly establish the elastic moduli of a number of different B ~ v ! realizations from the random medium B , and the corresponding statistics with a sufﬁcient accuracy . 3 . 2 Solutions of linear algebraic problems The steady - state conductivity and elastostatics problems on spring networks always lead to linear algebraic systems A (cid:149) x 5 b ( 3 . 6 ) because they simply are elliptic problems in discretized forms . There are , in principle , two methods to set up and solve the governing equations . One of them is exactly the same as that conventionally used in the ﬁnite element methods—involving the global stiffness matrix accompanied Fig . 8 a ! Parameter plane : aspect ratio of inclusions and the con - trast ; b ! spring network as a basis for resolution of round disks , ellipses , pixels , and needles in the parameter plane ; and c ! another interpretation of the parameter plane : from pixels to needles 42 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 by the connectivity of all the nodes—and will therefore not be elaborated here . The second one comes , just like the spring networks themselves , from the condensed matter physics . It is the so - called conjugate gradient method , which involves the energy of the system as a functional F ~ x ! 5 12 x (cid:149) A (cid:149) x 2 b (cid:149) x ( 3 . 7 ) of all the relevant degrees of freedom x , and the gradient of this energy „ F ~ x ! 5 A (cid:149) x 2 b ( 3 . 8 ) with respect to all these degrees . Once written in an explicit form as two subroutines , the program is connected with any of the widely available solvers ~ see , eg , @ 20 # ! . Note that F ( x ) is minimized when Eq . ~ 3 . 8 ! equals zero , which is then equivalent to Eq . ~ 3 . 6 ! . Of course , one may also employ other algebraic solvers . It is noteworthy that the entire task of mesh generation , such as typically required by the ﬁnite element methods , is absent . The energy and energy gradient subroutines are writ - ten once and for all for the given mesh of , say , Fig . 9 . The assignment of all the local spring stiffnesses—according to any chosen lattice model of Section 2—is done very rapidly in the ﬁrst stage of the program . These stiffnesses are stored in the common block ~ in case of a Fortran program ! and are readily accessible to the conjugate gradient subroutines that are activated in the second , and main , stage of the program . Once the energy minimum is reached to within any speciﬁed accuracy , this energy is used to compute the overall , effective moduli of a given domain of the lattice based on the postu - late of the energy equivalence , see eg , @ 21 – 23 # . Here we list several exact relations that may be used in testing the resulting computer programs . Some of them , as well as others , are also elaborated in @ 24 # . i ! Suppose we have solutions of two elasticity problems on a certain domain B , with boundary ] B , correspond - ing to the displacement ~ d ! and traction ~ t ! boundary value problems , respectively . Then we can check whether the Betti’s reciprocity theorem E ] B u i ~ t ! t i ~ d ! ds 5 E ] B u i ~ d ! t i ~ t ! ds ( 3 . 9 ) is satisﬁed numerically within some acceptable accu - racy . ii ! Perfect series and parallel systems are well known to result in the arithmetic and harmonic averages , or the so - called Voigt C V and Reuss bounds C R C V 5 f 1 C 1 1 f 2 C 2 C R 5 S f 1 C 1 1 f 2 C 2 D 2 1 ( 3 . 10 ) where f 1 and f 2 are the volume fractions of phases and 1 and 2 , respectively . iii ! The case of small contrast in properties allows an ex - pansion of , say , effective conductivity to second order in the difference ( C 2 2 C 1 ) as follows @ 25 # C eff 5 C 1 1 f 2 ~ C 2 2 C 1 ! 2 f 1 f 2 ~ C 2 2 C 1 ! 2 C 1 1 d 1 O ~ C 2 2 C 1 ! 3 1 . . . ( 3 . 11 ) where d is the dimensionality of the space . iv ! There are many exact relations in the 2D conductivity . Perhaps the best well known one , due to @ 26 # ~ also @ 27 # ! says that , for a two - phase isotropic system in 2D , C eff ~ C 1 , C 2 ! C eff ~ C 2 , C 1 ! 5 C 1 C 2 ( 3 . 12 ) where C eff ( C 1 , C 2 ) is the effective conductivity of a given system , while C eff ( C 1 , C 2 ) is the effective con - ductivity with the phases 1 and 2 interchanged . v ! The CLM theorem @ 28 , 29 # may be employed for planar elastic ~ classical as well as micropolar ! simply con - nected inhomogeneous materials with twice differen - tiable properties . To this end , let us consider an effec - tive compliance tensor S ijkleff relating the volume averaged ~ denoted by overbar ! stress and strain tensors « ij ¯ 5 S ijkleff s kl ¯ . ( 3 . 13 ) Now , the stresses s 11 , s 22 and s 12 are the same in the original and the equivalent materials S ijkl ( x ) and S ijklT ( x ) , so that the strain ﬁelds « ij and « ij ¯ satisfy the relation « ij ¯ 5 S ijklT s kl 5 S ijkl s kl 1 S ijklI ~ L , 2 L ! s kl 5 « ij 1 S ijklI ~ L , 2 L ! s kl . ( 3 . 14 ) Here T stands for a transformed material . Carrying out the volume averaging of Eq . ~ 3 . 14 ! , and noting that S ijkl ( L , 2 L ) is independent of position x , we ﬁnd « ij ¯ 5 S ijkleffT s kl 5 S ijkleff s kl ¯ 1 S ijklI ~ L , 2 L ! s kl ¯ ( 3 . 15 ) which shows that the effective compliance tensor of the second material is given by that of the ﬁrst material plus the same shift as that for the individual phases S ijkleffT 5 S ijkleff 1 S ijklI ~ L , 2 L ! . ( 3 . 16 ) Fig . 9 A functionally graded matrix - inclusion composite with 47 . 2 % volume fraction of black phase is partitioned into 8 3 8 sub - domains , corresponding to a 64 - processor parallel computer Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics 43 When dealing with very large systems , the spring network method is limited by the available computer memory size . This is , for example , the case with a functionally graded material . A composite of that type is shown in Fig . 9 , where the disk - matrix interphase is taken as a ﬁnite thickness zone of two randomly mixed phases of the disk ~ 2 ! and the matrix ~ 1 ! material . Both phases are locally homogeneous and isotropic—they are described by two constant isotropic con - ductivities C 1 and C 2 . We see here three different length - scales : the ﬁne structure of interphase region , the size and spacing of inclusions , and the macroscopic dimension of the composite . For this type of problems , we can also use parallel com - puting . Thus , in Fig . 9 we show a partition of the entire simulated domain of a functionally graded composite into 64 5 8 3 8 subdomains , each of which represents a 125 3 125 spring network that is assigned to a separate processor of a parallel computer . Thus , the boundary value is solved by using 64 processors operating in tandem . The computational effort is limited by the speed of a single processor ~ which goes down with the subdomain size ! and the communication between the processors ~ which simultaneously goes up ! . Finding the optimal partition , is , therefore , an important task . There are , in principle , two ways to execute such a parallel scheme : either to write one’s own software , or to adapt an existing solver running on a given parallel computer . The latter option is now becoming ever more realistic . 3 . 3 Example simulation of a polycrystal The generalization of the Kirkwood spring network model outlined in Section 2 to an anisotropic case was motivated by a need to study micromechanics of a planar polycrystalline aluminum specimen @ 14 # . The basic strategy is as follows . First , an image of crystal domains ~ ie , grains ! , such as the one showed in Fig . 10 , needs to be scanned and mapped onto a triangular mesh . Next , every bond is assigned its stiffness depending on the domain it falls in . And ﬁnally , the mechan - ics problem of the resulting spring network is solved com - putationally . In order to assign spring stiffnesses to any node of the spring network mesh , the 3D stiffness tensor C ijkm for each crystal must be found according to its transformation ~ rota - tion ! matrix a ij ( i , j 5 1 , 2 , 3 ) ; the latter is provided from the Kikuchi surface electron backscattering technique . Thus , to set up the spring network model , we start from the stiffness matrix C ab of an ~ anisotropic ! aluminum crystal which is given as C ab 5 3 10 . 82 6 . 13 6 . 13 0 0 0 6 . 13 10 . 82 6 . 13 0 0 0 6 . 13 6 . 13 10 . 82 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 . 85 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 . 85 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 . 85 4 10 4 MPa . ( 3 . 17 ) Its fourth - rank stiffness tensor C ijkm is then set up taking into account three symmetries C ijkm 5 C ijmk 5 C jikm 5 C kmij . We next use a transformation formula for a 4 - th rank tensor C 8 npqr 5 a ni a jp a kq a mr C ijkm n , p , q , r 5 1 , 2 , 3 ( 3 . 18 ) to set up the in - plane part of C 8 npqr at every mesh node . This 2D part , consisting of C 8 1111 , C 8 2222 , C 8 1122 , C 8 1112 , C 8 2212 , C 8 1212 is then mapped into the six spring constants a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , b 1 , b 2 , b 3 according to Eq . ~ 2 . 38 ! . This mapping is one - to - one and is given as F C 8 1111 C 8 2222 C 8 1122 C 8 1112 C 8 1212 C 8 2212 G 5 l 1 ) 1 16 ) 1 16 ) ) 4 ) ) 4 0 9 16 ) 9 16 ) ) 4 ) ) 4 0 ) 16 ) 16 2 9 4 ) 2 ) 2 2 ) 4 0 1 16 2 1 16 3 4 0 2 3 4 0 ) 16 ) 16 9 4 ) 0 9 4 ) 0 3 16 2 3 16 2 3 4 0 3 4 m 3 F a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 G . ( 3 . 19 ) Fig . 10 Scanned image of a very thin polycrystal aluminum sheet . All the grain boundaries are orthogonal to the plane of the sheet 44 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 While there was no ambiguity concerning the spring con - stant of any a - bond that entirely belonged to any given crys - tal domain , additional care had to be taken of the bonds that straddled the boundary of two crystals . The effective stiff - nesses were assigned according to a series rule : a 5 ( 1 / 2 a 1 1 1 / 2 a 2 ) 2 1 . Assignment of the b - springs , however , pre - sented no such ambiguities . This lattice model offered a basis for study of intergranular multi - crack propagation in an elastic - brittle , thin ~ quasi - 2D ! aluminum sheet , that would otherwise require a very labor intensive task of ﬁnite element meshing and inter - element crack advance ; see the aforemen - tioned paper . 4 PLANAR SPRING NETWORKS ON PERIODIC LATTICES : NONCLASSICAL CONTINUA 4 . 1 Triangular lattice of Bernoulli - Euler beams In the solid state physics literature , the Kirkwood and Keat - ing models are sometimes referred to as the beam - bending models . This is a misnomer since there is no account taken in these models of the actual presence of moments and curva - ture change of spring bonds connecting the neighboring nodes . True beam bending was fully and rigorously consid - ered by Wozniak @ 30 # and his coworkers , and considering a limited access to that unique book , in this section we give a very brief account of the triangular lattice case . We focus on the deformations of a typical beam , its bend - ing into a curved arch allowing the deﬁnition of its curvature , and a cut in a free body diagram specifying the normal force F , the shear force F˜ , and the bending moment M , see Fig . 11 . It follows that in 2D , the force ﬁeld within the beam network is described by ﬁelds of force - stresses s kl and moment - stresses m k , so that , we have a micropolar medium . The kinematics of a network of beams is now described by three functions u 1 ~ x ! u 2 ~ x ! w ~ x ! ( 4 . 1 ) which coincide with the actual displacements ~ u 1 , u 2 ! and rotations ~ w ! at the network nodes . Within each triangular pore , these functions may be assumed to be linear , and hence , the local strain , g kl , and curvature , k i , ﬁelds are related to u 1 , u 2 , and w by g kl 5 u l , k 1 e lk w k i 5 w , i ( 4 . 2 ) where e lk is the Ricci symbol . It follows from geometric considerations that g ~ b ! [ n k ~ b ! n l ~ b ! g kl ( 4 . 3 ) is the average axial strain , with s ( b ) g ( b ) being its average axial length change . Similarly , g ˜ ~ b ! [ n k ~ b ! n˜ l ~ b ! g kl 5 n k ~ b ! n˜ l ~ b ! u ~ l , k ! 2 w ( 4 . 4 ) is the difference between the rotation angle of the beam chord and the rotation angle of its end node . Thus , the dif - ference between the rotation angles of its ends is k ~ b ! [ n k ~ b ! k k . ( 4 . 5 ) The elementary beam theory implies that the force - displacement and moment - rotation response laws of each bond ~ Fig . 11 ! are given as F ~ b ! 5 E ~ b ! A ~ b ! g ~ b ! F˜ ~ b ! 5 12 E ~ b ! I ~ b ! s 2 g ˜ ~ b ! M ~ b ! 5 E ~ b ! I ~ b ! k ~ b ! ( 4 . 6 ) where A ( b ) 5 wh is the beam cross - sectional area , I ( b ) 5 w 3 h / 12 is its centroidal moment of inertia with respect to an axis normal to the plane of the network , and E ( b ) is the Young’s modulus of the beam’s material . All the beams are of length s [ s ( b ) , which is the spacing of the mesh . Turning now to the continuum picture , the strain energy of the micropolar continuum is expressed as U continuum 5 V 2 g ij C ijkm g km 1 V 2 k i D ij k j ( 4 . 7 ) from which we ﬁnd C ijkm 5 ( b 5 1 6 n i ~ b ! n k ~ b ! ~ n j ~ b ! n m ~ b ! R ~ b ! 1 n j ~ b ! n m ~ b ! R˜ ~ b ! ! D ij 5 ( b 5 1 6 n i ~ b ! n j ~ b ! S ~ b ! ( 4 . 8 ) where R ~ b ! 5 2 E ~ b ! A ~ b ! s ~ b ! ) R˜ ~ b ! 5 24 E ~ b ! I ~ b ! ~ s ~ b ! ! 3 ) S ~ b ! 5 2 E ~ b ! I ~ b ! s ~ b ! ) . ( 4 . 9 ) If we assume all the beams to be the same ~ R ( b ) 5 R , etc ! , we obtain C 1111 5 C 2222 5 38 ~ 3 R 1 R˜ ! C 1212 5 38 ~ R 1 3 R˜ ! C 1122 5 C 2211 5 38 ~ R 2 R˜ ! C 1221 5 C 2112 5 38 ~ R 2 R˜ ! D 11 5 D 22 5 38 S ( 4 . 10 ) with all the other components of the stiffness tensors being zero . That is , we have C ijkm 5 d ij d km J 1 d ik d jm L 1 d im d jk P D ij eff 5 d ij G ( 4 . 11 ) in which J 5 P 5 38 ~ R 2 R˜ ! L 5 38 ~ R 1 3 R˜ ! G 5 32 S . ( 4 . 12 ) We note from Eq . ( 4 . 11 ) 1 that this beam lattice is an isotro - pic continuum , rather than anisotropic as reported in @ 31 , 32 # . The micropolar model @ 30 , 33 # is conveniently expressed in terms of four compliances— A , S , P , and M —which are readily identiﬁed as A 5 1 J 1 L 1 P 2 S 5 2 L 1 P P 5 2 L 2 P M 5 2 3 G . ( 4 . 13 ) The effective bulk and shear moduli are now identiﬁed on the basis of Eq . ~ 4 . 11 ! as Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics 45 k 5 34 R m 5 38 ~ R 1 R˜ ! ( 4 . 14 ) which are seen to reduce to the formulas of Section 2 . 3 in the special case of ﬂexural rigidity being absent . Furthermore , the effective Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio are E 5 3 R 1 1 R˜ R 3 1 R˜ R n 5 1 2 R˜ R 3 1 R˜ R . ( 4 . 15 ) It is noteworthy that the introduction of beam - type effects has a similar inﬂuence on E and n as the introduction of the angular b - interactions in the Kirkwood model . However , noting that R˜ / R 5 ( w / s ) 2 , where w is the beam width , we see that , in view of the slenderness assumption of the beam ele - ments , this model does not admit Poisson’s ratios below ; 0 . 2 . Finally , we note that the stiffness tensors ~ 4 . 11 ! can be inverted to get the compliance tensors S ijkm ~ 1 ! 5 14 @ d ij d km ~ A 2 S ! 1 d ik d jm ~ S 1 P ! 1 d im d jk ~ S 2 P ! # S ij ~ 2 ! 5 d ij G ( 4 . 16 ) so that , recalling the deﬁnition of the micropolar character - istic length @ 10 # , l 2 5 S 1 P 4 M 5 l 24 1 1 3 S w s D 2 1 1 S w s D 2 ( 4 . 17 ) where we used the basic facts relating the beam’s cross - sectional area to its moment of inertia . 4 . 2 Triangular lattice of Timoshenko beams In the foregoing section we began with the model of Bernoulli - Euler beams , which implies slender connections between the lattice nodes . It is well known that the situation of stubby connections is describable more adequately by Ti - moshenko beams . The boundary value problem that needs to be solved is that of a beam ﬁxed at its both ends and sub - jected to a shear displacement at one end . That is , with the boundary conditions at the beam’s left end n ~ 0 ! 5 0 u ~ 0 ! 5 0 n 8 ~ 0 ! 2 u ~ 0 ! 5 0 ( 4 . 18 ) and right end n ~ s ! 5 g ˜ ~ b ! s u ~ s ! 5 0 n 8 ~ s ! 2 u ~ s ! 5 0 ( 4 . 19 ) it is readily determined from the beam’s governing equations E ~ b ! I ~ b ! u 9 1 G ~ b ! A ~ b ! ~ n 8 2 u ! 5 0 G ~ b ! A ~ b ! ~ n 9 2 u 8 ! 5 0 ( 4 . 20 ) that a following relation holds between the shear force F˜ ( b ) and the displacement s g ˜ ( b ) F˜ ~ b ! 5 12 E ~ b ! I ~ b ! s 3 ~ 1 1 b ! s g ˜ ~ b ! . ( 4 . 21 ) Here b 5 12 E ~ b ! I ~ b ! G ~ b ! A ~ b ! s 2 5 E ~ b ! G ~ b ! S w s D 2 ( 4 . 22 ) is the dimensionless ratio of bending to shear stiffness , with A ( b ) 5 t a w being the beam’s cross - sectional area , and I ( b ) 5 t a w 3 / 12 its centroidal moment of inertia . Two limiting cases of b are well known : b ! 0 , high shear stiffness and , hence , less deﬂection owing to shear ; the Bernoulli - Euler slender beam is recovered ; b . 1 , low shear stiffness and , hence , deﬂection owing to Fig . 11 The lattice geometry ~ a ! ; curvature and internal loads in a single beam element ~ b ! 46 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 shear dominates over that due to the Young’s modulus E ( b ) ; this is the general case of the Timoshenko beam . Observing that Eq . ~ 4 . 21 ! replaces ( 4 . 6 ) 2 , we now pro - ceed to derive the effective moduli so that ~ 4 . 9 ! is replaced by R ~ b ! 5 2 E ~ b ! A ~ b ! s ~ b ! ) R˜ ~ b ! 5 24 E ~ b !

( 4 . 24 ) Following the same steps as in the previous section , we see that the effective continuum moduli are given by Eqs . ~ 4 . 14 ! – ~ 4 . 15 ! as before . It is now possible to express them in terms of the beam aspect ratio and b . Thus , for E eff ~ normal - ized by the beam’s modulus E ( b ) ! and n eff , we ﬁnd E eff t a E ~ b ! 5 2 ) w s 1 1 S w s D 2 1 1 1 b 3 1 S w s D 2 1 1 1 b n eff 5 1 2 S w s D 2 1 1 1 b 3 1 S w 2 D 2 1 1 1 b .

( 4 . 26 ) The above are plotted in Fig . 12 b , c for the special case E ( b ) 5 9 G ( b ) . We see that the consideration of lattice connec - tions as stubby ~ Timoshenko ! beams has a minor softening effect on E eff relative to the Bernoulli - Euler beam model . This may be explained by noting that the admission of the beam’s angle of rotation as an independent degree of free - dom amounts to G ( b ) being ﬁnite , rather than inﬁnite , in the Timoshenko beam model . The Poisson’s ratio falls off non - linearly from 1 / 3 with p increasing in both models . The ad - mission of ﬁnite shear modulus is weak . Also plotted in Fig . 12 b , c are the results for the central - force lattice of Section 4 . 2 , the perforated plate model introduced below , and the Cox model discussed in Section 5 . 4 . 3 From stubby beams to a perforated plate model As the volume fraction p rises beyond 50 % , the beam’s as - pect ratio w / s increases so high that one can no longer model the connections between the lattice nodes as beams . Thus , a basic question arises : can any simple explicit model be de - rived for this low porosity range ? One avenue is offered by a perforated plate model . In the limit of p ! 1 , we have a plate with a regular distribution of triangular - shaped pores , Fig . 12 a . This is a so - called dilute limit of a locally isotropic material with holes ~ in either periodic or disordered arrange - ments ! . Following @ 34 , 35 # , the respective formulas are E eff t a E ~ b ! 5 1 2 a ~ 1 2 p ! n eff 5 n ~ b ! 2 a ~ n ~ b ! 2 n 0 ! ~ 1 2 p ! . ( 4 . 27 ) The coefﬁcients a 5 4 . 2019 and n 0 5 0 . 2312 have been com - puted in the above references , and , in fact , analogous coefﬁ - cients are also available there for plates with other than tri - angular holes ~ squares , pentagons , . . . ! . It is noteworthy that : 1 ! both formulas are uncoupled from one another ; 2 ! ( 4 . 27 ) 1 models the low porosity range ~ high p - values ! much better than the beam lattice model ; summarizing , E eff is modeled by an upper envelope of all the curves in Fig . 12 b , ie , curves 3 and 5 . 3 ! ( 4 . 27 ) 2 depends on the Poisson’s ratio n ( b ) of the plate material ; the latter can be speciﬁed only in the Timoshenko beam model . One more question remains in connection with Fig . 12 : What happens in the range of the p - values which are too high for a beam lattice model to hold and too low for the dilute model to be truly dilute ? Or , can anything be done to smooth out the transition between the two curves 3 and 5 at p around 0 . 8 ? One could try here a usual device of micromechanics : an effective medium theory in any one of its guises : differ - ential scheme , self - consistent , etc @ 35 # . However , for the sake of clarity of Fig . 12 b , c , we do not plot these . Summing up , it is seen from Fig . 12 that , as p grows , beam bending tends to increase the effective Young’s modu - lus E eff . In other words , bending effects increase as connec - tions become wider . On the other hand , as they become slen - der , one can work with segments carrying axial forces only . Thus , beam effects gain in inﬂuence as the pores’ volume fraction decreases , and lead to an increase of the effective Young’s modulus relative to the central - force model . Two more things may be said about the beam network model . First , Timoshenko beams , although more sophisti - cated than Bernoulli - Euler beams , remain , in principle , 1D objects , of micropolar type , in fact . Therefore , what they yield is about as far as one can get with a beam model . A better approach should consider beam segments as little plates , ie , 2D objects , as recently implemented in @ 36 # . Fi - nally , lattice nodes that are taken as rigid objects in this model , could more realistically be modeled by considering their deformability ; this will be demonstrated below . 4 . 4 Square lattice of Bernoulli - Euler beams Following the same procedure as in Section 4 . 2 , we now analyze a micropolar model of a square lattice network , Fig . 13 ; the triangular case was treated in @ 37 # . Thus , assuming Bernoulli - Euler beams , we ﬁnd an analogous version of Eq . ~ 4 . 8 ! C ijkm 5 ( b 5 1 4 n i ~ b ! n k ~ b ! ~ n j ~ b ! n m ~ b ! R ~ b ! 1 n j ~ b ! n m ~ b ! R˜ ~ b ! !

( 4 . 29 ) When all the beams are identical , this leads to C 1111 5 C 2222 5 R C 1212 5 C 2121 5 R˜ D 11 5 D 22 5 S ( 4 . 30 ) with all the other components of the stiffness tensors being zero . Clearly , this beam lattice results in a special case of an orthotropic continuum . Fig . 13 A square beam lattice 48 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 In the foregoing derivation , lattice nodes were taken as rigid objects .

Such models , in contradistinction to the more classical homogenization methods , do more correctly ac - count for the internal microstructure . For more recent work on models of lattice structures , see @ 40 # , and for mathemati - cal aspects of their homogenization consult @ 41 # . 4 . 5 Non - local and gradient elasticity on a lattice with central interactions Let us now focus our attention on a lattice made of two central force structures with : structure I ~ a regular triangular network with short range interactions ! and structure II ~ three regular triangular networks with long - range interactions ! . These structures are superposed in a way shown in Fig . 14 so that a typical node communicates with its six nearest neigh - bors via structure I , and with its six second neighbors via structure II . Generalizing the development of Section 2 . 3 , the central - force interaction in the spring connecting the nodes r and r 8 is related to the displacements u ( r ) and u ( r 8 ) of these nodes by F i ~ r , r 8 ! 5 F ij rr 8 D u j ~ r , r 8 ! ( 4 . 33 ) where F ij rr 8 5 a rr 8 D r i D r j D u j ~ r , r 8 ! 5 u j ~ r 8 ! 2 u j ~ r ! D r i 5 r i 8 2 r i . ( 4 . 34 ) Similar to the case of anti - plane elasticity , a rr 8 is the spring constant of a half - length of a given interaction . However , assuming the structures I and II to be made of two types of springs , respectively , we simply have two kinds of spring constants : a I and a II . s I 5 2 l is the lattice spacing of struc - ture I , while s II 5 s I ) is that of structure II . A following question arises now : What continuum model should be set up to approximate this discrete system ? Fol - lowing @ 42 # , three types of continuum models will now be formulated : local , non - local , and strain - gradient . a ) Local continuum model Proceeding as in Section 2 . 3 under conditions of uniform strain , and postulating the equivalence of strain energy in a unit cell of volume V 5 2 ) l due to all the spring constants E 5 1 2 ( r , r 8 F i ~ r , r 8 !

The above ten - sors are of the form ~ 2 . 25 ! , so that Fig . 14 Two structures , I and II , resulting in a lattice with local ~ nearest neighbor ! and nonlocal ~ second neighbor ! interactions . Note that the structure II consists of three triangular networks hav - ing separate sets of nodes , and that all these nodes coincide with the nodes of structure I .

As a result , the more inhomoge - neous is the strain ﬁeld , the closer is the non - local model to grasping the actual strain state of the lattice . First , we dis - tribute the values of tensors C ijkmI and C ijkmII at point r uni - formly over the regions of interactions of structures I and II ~ Fig . 14 ! , and form a new tensor C ijkm ( r , r 8 ) such that C ijkm ~ r , r 8 ! 5 C ijkmI ~ r , r 8 ! 1 C ijkmII ~ r , r 8 ! C ijkmI ~ r , r 8 ! 5 C ijkmI h I ~ r , r 8 ! A I C ijkmII ~ r , r 8 ! 5 C ijkmII h II ~ r , r 8 ! A II ( 4 . 40 ) Here A I 5 p ( s I ) 2 , A II 5 p ( s II ) 2 are the areas , while h I ( r , r 8 ) and h II ( r , r 8 ) are the characteristic functions of the regions of interactions in the neighborhood of r . c ) Strain - gradient continuum model A strain - gradient model is similar to the non - local model in that it resolves the local inhomogeneity of deformation within the range of interactions associated with a continuum point . One begins here with a series expansion of the relative displacement ﬁeld involving two terms—linear and quadratic—that is D u j ~ r , r 8 ! 5 « ij r ~ r j 8 2 r j ! 1 12 g ijk r ~ r j 8 2 r j ! ~ r k 8 2 r k ! ( 4 . 41 ) where « ij r 5 u ~ i , j ! ~ r ! g ijk r 5 « ~ i , j , k ! ~ r ! ( 4 . 42 ) are gradients of the ﬁrst and second orders , respectively , of the displacement ﬁeld . In view of Eq . ~ 4 . 43 ! , the elastic energy of the structure ~ 4 . 37 ! is now expressed as E 5 1 2 ( r , r 8 F ij rr 8 F « ik r ~ r k 8 2 r k ! 1 1 2 g ikm r ~ r k 8 2 r k ! ~ r m 8 2 r m ! G 1 @ « jm r ~ r m 8 2 r m ! 1 12 g jmn r ~ r m 8 2 r m ! ~ r n 8 2 r m ! # . ( 4 . 43 ) Noting the continuum form of energy E continuum 5 1 2 E V ~ « ij C ijkl « kl 1 g ijk C ijklmn g lmn ! dV ( 4 . 44 ) one can identify C ijkl ~ r , r 8 ! 5 C ijklI ~ r , r 8 ! 1 C ijklII ~ r , r 8 ! C ijklmn ~ r , r 8 ! 5 C ijklmn I ~ r , r 8 ! 1 C ijklmn II ~ r , r 8 ! ( 4 . 45 ) where C ijklI ~ r , r 8 ! 5 2 E I A I ) s I ( b 5 1 , 2 , 3 n iI ~ b ! n jI ~ b ! n kI ~ b ! n lI ~ b !

( 4 . 46 ) with completely analogous formulas holding for C ijklII ( r , r 8 ) and C ijklmnII ( r , r 8 ) . Further considerations of these models , especially in connection with the setup of boundary value problems , the modeling of surface energy accounting for the heterogeneity of material properties in the boundary layer of the microstructure , and the determination of the internal forces are given in @ 43 # . The subject of higher order gradient theories has received a lot of attention over the last decade , eg , @ 44 # . 4 . 6 Plate - bending response We can apply the same approach as that outlined so far for the in - plane problems , to the determination of effective plate - bending response of a periodic beam network . We sketch the basic ideas in terms of a triangular lattice , within the assumptions of a Kirchhoff ~ thin ! plate model . To this end , we must consider out - of - plane deformations of a trian - gular geometry lattice , Fig . 15 . The kinematics is , therefore , described by three functions—one out - of - plane displacement and two rotations ~ with respect to the x 1 and x 2 axes ! u ~ x > ! w 1 ~ x > ! . w 2 ~ x > ! ( 4 . 47 ) which coincide with the actual displacement ~ u ! and rota - tions ( w 1 , w 2 ) at the lattice vertices . Within each triangular pore these functions may be assumed to be linear . It follows then that the strain and curvature ﬁelds are related to u , w 1 , w 2 by k kl 5 w l , k g k 5 u , k 1 « kl w l . ( 4 . 48 ) Fig . 15 A perspective view of a triangular geometry lattice , show - ing the relevant internal loads in a beam cross section 50 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 With reference to Fig . 15 , the mechanical ~ force - displacement and moment - rotation ! response laws of each beam are given as M ~ b ! 5 C ~ b ! k ~ b !

The mechanical quantities are as follows : C ( b ) is a torsional stiffness of the beam ; E ( b ) is Young’s modulus of the beam ; M ( b ) is an in - plane twisting moment in the beam ; M˜ ( b ) is an out - of - plane bending moment in the beam ; P ( b ) is a shear force in the beam ; g ˜ ( b ) is a beam shear deformation ; and k ( b ) is a beam’s curvature . The strain energy of the unit cell is U continuum 5 V 2 k ¯ ij C ijkleff k ¯ kl 1 V 2 g ¯ i A ijeff g ¯ j ( 4 . 50 ) which is consistent with the Hooke’s law m kl 5 C ijkl k kl p k 5 A kl g l .

Here , a generic model is provided by a honeycomb lattice of beams . By analyzing the rhombus - shaped cell of Fig . 5 a with hexagons of side length s , Wang and Stronge @ 45 # derived a micropolar model with the energy of unit cell in the form ~ 4 . 7 ! .

Clearly , this beam lattice results in an isotro - pic continuum , and we note ~ recall Appendix again ! that its effective Poisson’s ratio is about unity . We refer the reader to @ 46 # for continuum - type fracture analyses of porous materials with hexagonal as well as square and triangular microgeometries . 5 RIGIDITY OF NETWORKS 5 . 1 Structural topology and rigidity percolation When considering a central force ~ or truss ! system , a ques - tion of fundamental importance is whether such a structure is a sufﬁciently constrained system or not . In other words , is it an intrinsically rigid body ? This is the subject matter of a ﬁeld called structural topology . In the following , we provide its basic concepts . Any central force network is a set of ver - tices bars , or edges , and nodes ~ frictionless pivots ! , or verti - ces . We immediately have an edge set E , and a vertex set V , so that the network is represented by a graph G ( V , E ) . An edge is an unordered pair of two vertices . Structural rigidity can be based on statics or on kinematics , and , as we shall see below , they are in a certain sense equivalent . The statical approach involves , in the ﬁrst place , the con - cept of an equilibrium load . A system of forces assigned to the nodes of a network is said to be an equilibrium load if and only if ~ iff ! the sum of the assigned vectors is the zero vector , and the total moment of those vectors about any one point is zero . A network resolves an equilibrium load iff there is an assignment of tensions and compressions to all the bars of E , such that the sum at each node is equal and opposite to its assigned load . A structure is said to be statically rigid iff it resolves all equilibrium loads . The kinematical approach involves the concept of an in - ﬁnitesimal motion , which is an assignment of velocities to all the nodes of V , such that the difference of velocities as - signed to the ends of any bar is perpendicular to the bar itself . This means that the motion does not result in any extension or compression of the bar . Every connected plane structure has at least three degrees of freedom ~ two transla - tions and one rotation ! , and this is called a rigid motion . A Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics 51 structure is said to be inﬁnitesimally rigid iff all its inﬁnitesi - mal motions are rigid motions . These statical and kinemati - cal pictures are connected by a theorem due to Crapo and Whiteley @ 47 # : A structure is statically rigid iff it is inﬁnitesi - mally rigid . A structure is said to be isostatic iff it is minimally rigid , that is , when it is inﬁnitesimally rigid . But , the removal of any bar introduces some inﬁnitesimal motion . Clearly , in an isostatic structure all the bars are necessary to maintain the overall rigidity . In statics , this is called a statically determi - nate structure , as opposed to the indeterminate ones which have more than a minimally sufﬁcient number of bars for the global rigidity . It is a well known result that , in 2D , a deter - minate structure of u V u nodes has edges numbering u E u 5 2 u V u 2 3 ( 5 . 1 ) where u u denotes the number of elements in a given set . As an example , let us consider an incomplete triangular lattice shown in Fig . 16 . While it satisﬁes Eq . ~ 5 . 1 ! , it is not at all clear whether it is isostatic . This example shows that u E u 5 2 u V u 2 3 is only a neces - sary , but not a sufﬁcient condition for rigidity . The latter is provided by this theorem ~ eg , @ 48 , 49 # ! : A planar graph struc - ture is isostatic if and only if it has 2 u V u 2 3 bars , and for every m , 2 < m < u V u , no subset of m nodes has more than 2 m 2 3 bars connecting it . This , effectively , allows one to check whether the edges of the graph are not distributed spatially in a uniform manner . If they are crowded locally , than the odds are that the structure is not isostatic . The isostatic concept so far discussed falls in the category of generic rigidity , where only the topological information on a graph’s connectivity comes into picture . However , one may also deal with the unexpected inﬁnitesimal motions when , say , two edges incident onto the same vertex lie on a straight line . When dealing with very large systems—as encountered in condensed matter physics—we need to ask the question : What critical fraction , p r , of edges of E needs to be kept so as to render the structure isostatic ? We note that we would have u E 8 u 5 p r u E u new edges of thus modiﬁed , or depleted , set u E 8 u . It follows immediately from u E 8 u 5 2 u V u 2 3 that we would have p r 5 2 / 3 . This value is a simple estimate of the so - called rigidity percolation , a concept also useful in con - densed matter and biophysics , eg @ 50 – 52 # . As shown in these references , the actual critical point occurs at a little different value than 2 / 3 ; theoretical methods involved include effec - tive medium theories and spring network computations . The latter of these will be demonstrated later on the example of Delaunay networks . Finally , it is important to keep in mind that the rigidity percolation typically occurs above the connectivity percola - tion , ie , p r . p c . For example , p c for a triangular network equals 1 / 3 . 5 . 2 Rigidity of a graph of Poisson line ﬁeld geometry The Poisson line ﬁeld @ 53 # forms a classical model of a cel - lulose ﬁber network encountered in paper @ 54 # . We now identify the line segments ~ between any two consecutive in - tersections ! to be edges of E , and pivots to be vertices of V . Let us recall that the triple - ﬁber intersections occur with probability zero for isotropic and anisotropic distributions of lines angles . Thus , we typically have vertices of connectivity 4 , ie , V 4 . Now , with reference to Fig . 17 a , which shows a typical realization of the Poisson line ﬁeld , we see that there are two types of edges : those in direct contact with the square shaped window , and those entirely in the interior . Clearly , the square window is needed to prevent these boundary layer bonds from dangling , and this immediately renders the entire Fig . 16 A triangular lattice with 71 edges and 37 vertices ; it is generically rigid .

Figure d ! shows large , mechanism - type motions of the network in - cluding those of some ﬁbers which spring outside the original do - main of the network . 52 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 network a mechanism . However , one may argue that the boundary layer of dangling bonds is very thin relative to the whole ﬁeld , and ask the question concerning the isostatic condition for the graph G ( V , E ) representing the interior net - work of edges not directly in contact with the square window boundary ; these are shown in bold in Fig . 17 a . Here we observe that , while the V 4 vertices occur in the interior of this graph , its boundary involves V 2 and V 3 vertices . Now , since there are two vertices to every edge , we can calculate the total number of edges in the bold drawn graph G ( V , E ) according to u E u 5 u V 2 u 1 32 u V 3 u 1 2 u V 4 u ( 5 . 2 ) Evidently , since V 5 V 2 ł V 3 ł V 4 , the total number of all the vertices is u V u 5 u V 2 u 1 u V 3 u 1 u V 4 u ( 5 . 3 ) so that u E u , 2 u V u 2 3 . The system is not isostatic , it is under - constrained ~ ie , a mechanism ! . Given this observation , the Poisson line ﬁeld of axial force ﬁber segments ~ the so - called Cox model @ 54 # ! is not a valid model of paper or any other solid material for that matter . The fact that the Cox model does give ﬁnite values for elastic moduli including the shear modulus , is easily explained by the presence of fully stretched ﬁbers spanning the entire test window . The situa - tion is analogous to a graph of a square lattice topology , which , even though it is an obvious mechanism , will give ﬁnite axial moduli in two directions if fully stretched and subjected to kinematic boundary conditions . In real networks , ﬁbers have ﬁnite length , so their ends are loose . When ﬁber ends are removed to eliminate their obvious mechanism motions , the number of vertices in sets V 2 and V 3 increases . Consequently , Eq . ~ 5 . 1 ! is even further from being satisﬁed . In order to deal with ﬁnite ﬁber effects , Cox and others modiﬁed the basic model by a so - called shear - lag theory . However , the latter assumes single ﬁber segments to carry axial and shear forces only , which ~ see Section 6 ! , is not a valid model of a solid element : ﬁber bending should also be included . Paper exhibits ﬁnite stiffnesses in 2D as well as in 3D . In the latter case , condition ~ 5 . 1 ! is replaced by an even more stringent one as more constraints are needed when dealing with the additional degrees of freedom @ 49 # . 5 . 3 Loss of rigidity in a ﬁber - beam network Besides the foregoing structural topology considerations , there is another fact which casts doubt on any ﬁber network model in which ﬁber segments are joined by pivots . Namely , any two cellulosic ﬁbers have a ﬁnite contact area of hydro - gen bonding @ 55 # , which would be sheared by hinge - type connections . While it is very difﬁcult to assess experimen - tally to what extent this region is deformable , our model will treat it as somewhat deformable in the sense that bonds are rigid , but have no dimension , and ﬁber segments are treated as extensible beams from node to node of the graph G ( V , E ) @ 56 # . This modeling of mechanics of ﬁber networks is similar to that of i ! cement - coated wood strands composites @ 57 # , ii ! highly porous materials @ 58 # , and iii ! battery systems @ 59 , 60 # . In general , it is based on the following assumptions and steps : 1 ! Generate a system of ﬁnite - length straight ﬁbers such as shown in Fig . 17 b according to speciﬁc geometric char - acteristics : distribution of ﬁber lengths and widths , distri - bution of angular orientations of ﬁber chords , etc . The ﬁbers are laid in three dimensions on top of one another with a possible non - zero out - of - plane angle according to a Fourier series - type probability density function p ~ u ! 5 1 p ~ 1 1 a 1 cos 2 u 1 a 2 cos 4 u 1 . . . 1 a n cos 2 n u 1 . . . ! 0 , u < p ( 5 . 4 ) u is the angle a ﬁber makes with respect to the x - axis , and it must be between zero and p . 2 ! Fibers are homogeneous , but each ﬁber may have differ - ent dimensions and mechanical properties , all sampled from any prescribed statistical distribution . 3 ! Each ﬁber is a series of linear elastic 3D extensible Ti - moshenko beam elements . Each of these is described by a stiffness matrix written here in an abbreviated form set up in a corotational coordinate system @ 61 # F F T M y a M za M yb M zb G 5 3 EA l 0 0 0 0 0 0 GJ l 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 a ~ l 2 1 3 g ! 0 2 a ~ l 2 2 6 g ! 0 0 0 0 4 b ~ l 2 1 3 h ! 0 2 b ~ l 2 2 6 h ! 0 0 2 a ~ l 2 2 6 h ! 0 4 a ~ l 2 1 3 g ! 0 0 0 0 2 b ~ l 2 2 6 h ! 0 4 a ~ l 2 1 3 g ! 4 F D L Du x u y a u za u yb u zb G ( 5 . 5 ) Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics 53 where g 5 12 EI y GA h 5 12 EI z GA a 5 EI y l ~ 12 g 1 l 2 ! b 5 EI z l ~ 12 h 1 l 2 ! .

Equilibrium is found under kinematic boundary condi - tions u i 5 e ¯ ij x j . 6 ! All six effective , in - plane stiffness coefﬁcients are deter - mined from the postulate of equivalence of strain energy stored in a square - shaped window of ﬁnite thickness with the strain energy of an equivalent , hypothetical con - tinuum . The undeformed network , shown in Fig . 17 b in its top view , has the following parameters : window size : 4 3 4 3 0 . 1 mm a 1 5 1 , and other coefﬁcients in Eq . ~ 5 . 4 ! are zero ; ﬁber length : 2 mm ; ﬁber width : 0 . 04 mm ; ﬁber height : 0 . 015 mm . As a result of a Boolean process of ﬁber placement ~ eg , @ 62 # ! , we obtain : 195 ﬁbers with an average of 4 . 8 bonds per ﬁber , the whole system having 859 nodes with six degrees of freedom per node . A state of deformation corresponding to axial strain e 11 5 8 % is shown in Fig . 17 c . The analyzed strain is actually 1 % , and displacements are magniﬁed for clarity . Compare this deformed network to that in Fig . 17 d , which shows the same network of ﬁbers subjected to the same strain but with the ratio of ﬁber ﬂexural stiffness to ﬁber axial stiffness re - duced by a factor of 10 2 4 . Note the following : 1 ! The sharp kinks we see in both ﬁgures are only the arti - fact of simple computer graphics—the micromechanical model assumes ﬁbers deform into differentiable curves . Magniﬁcation creates the appearance of large displace - ments . Actually , an inﬁnitesimal displacement assumption is used in the computational mechanics program . 2 ! The kinks are far more pronounced when ﬁbers have low ﬂexural stiffness . Portions of the network where con - nected ﬁbers do not form triangular pores can generate signiﬁcant forces in response to deformation when ﬁbers have high ﬂexural stiffness , but they cannot do so when ﬁbers rely almost entirely on axial stiffness . These por - tions of the network are not stable in the sense of loss of generic rigidity discussed earlier . 3 ! We do not study this rigid - ﬂoppy transition by turning , in an ad hoc fashion , all the connections into pivots . Rather , with the model taking into account all the displacements and rotations of nodes , we can study it as a continuous function of ﬁber slenderness ; see also @ 63 # . Note that this aspect is impossible to investigate with models based on central - force potentials for single ﬁber segments @ 64 # . Our model , thus , ﬁlls the gap pointed out in @ 65 # consist - ing of a need to set up ﬁnite element models of 3D dis - ordered ﬁber networks , yet avoids their simplistic map - ping into electrical resistor networks of the same topology . 4 ! The network of ﬁber - beams , together with a two - scale geometric disorder , offers a possible explanation of the special orthotropy of paper in which the shear modulus is effectively invariant with respect to rotations @ 66 # . 6 SPRING NETWORK MODELS : DISORDERED TOPOLOGIES 6 . 1 Load transfer mechanisms in heterogeneous media The spring network models are most natural when applied to systems that have the same topology as the underlying lat - tice . One instinctive example has been discussed in Section 4 . 5 : a cellulose ﬁber network . Another one is offered by a granular medium . Here , the principal method of computa - tional mechanics analyses , dating back to @ 67 # , is called the discrete element ~ DE ! model . Let us here employ a graph representation of the planar granular medium : a graph G ( V , E ) , whereby vertices of the set V signify grain centers and edges of the set E represent the existing grain - grain interactions , Fig . 18 ~ a ! . We ﬁx an r - u polar coordinate system at a grain’s center . There are several types of the DE model that one may consider . • Central interactions : the total energy is a sum total of cen - tral interactions of all the edges U 5 U central ( 6 . 1 ) and this model is a generalization of the basic model of Section 2 . 3 . • Central and angular interactions : the total energy is modi - ﬁed to U 5 U central 1 U angular ( 6 . 2 ) and , this model is a generalization of what we saw in Sec - tion 2 . 4 . Continuum mechanics tells us that e uu equals ] r 2 1 u u / ] u 1 u r / r . This shows that the angular changes Df / f between two adjacent edges V 1 - V 2 and V 1 - V 3 in Fig . 18 correspond to ] r 2 1 u u / ] u in the r - u polar coordi - nate system ﬁxed at a grain’s center . This term does not show up in two other expressions for e rr and e r u . How - ever , u r / r is due to a radial displacement , and so Df / f does not exactly equal e uu , which leads us to call it a uu - type strain . We adopt the so - called Kirkwood model to account for Df / f in addition to the normal grain - grain interactions . Thus , we introduce angular springs of con - stant k a acting between the edges V 1 - V 2 and V 1 - V 3 inci - dent onto the node V 1 , Fig . 18 d ; the edges remain straight throughout deformation . • Central , shear and bending interactions : the total energy is U 5 U central 1 U shear 1 U moment ( 6 . 3 ) and , this model is a generalization of what we saw in Sec - tions 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 , depending on the type of beam chosen . This is a typical DE model , which , of course , may be 54 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 termed a locally inhomogeneous micropolar continuum , with inhomogeneity varying on the scale of grains ; see Section 6 . 2 below . • Central , shear , bending , and angular interactions : the total energy is One may argue that the three - point interaction should be introduced in the DE models so as to better represent the micromechanics , and to make , in accordance with Fig . 18 c , the strain U 5 U central 1 U shear 1 U moment 1 U angular ( 6 . 4 ) energy stored in a single Voronoi cell equal to Eq . ~ 6 . 4 ! . However , there exist successful DE models which account for normal and shear forces only @ 68 , 69 # ; this neglect of the contact moment is justiﬁed by the fact that only small numerical errors are thus caused in problems of interest in granular materials . In the case of a regular , triangular array of disks , this model is equivalent to a classical Born model of crystal lattices which is known to lack the rotational invariance @ 70 # . 6 . 2 Graph models of heterogeneous media Let us pursue the planar graph representation of granular media in some more detail , Satake @ 71 , 72 # . First , we list in Table 1 a correspondence between a system of rotund grains and its graph model . Besides the vertex and edge sets intro - duced earlier , we also have a loop set L . With this geometric reference , we can set up an assign - ment of mechanical quantities—forces on the left and corre - sponding kinematic measures on the right—in Table 2 . The connectivity of the graph is described by the inci - dence matrix D n e . Let us write down a total of 3 u V u scalar equilibrium equations , each one with respect to a typical grain of radius r n and volume V n Fig . 18 a ! A cluster of ﬁve grains showing the lines of interactions ; b ! a discrete element model showing the normal force , the shear force , and the moment exerted by grains 2 and 3 each onto the grain 1 ; c ! a most general model showing the same grain - grain interactions as before but augmented by an internal , angular spring constant k a ; and d ! a simpliﬁed model adopted in this paper , showing only normal ( k n ) and angular ( k a ) effects .

( 6 . 6 ) Here n e is the unit vector of edge e in the nonoriented graph . The operator ~ 6 . 6 ! also plays a key role in the kinematics of all the edges F D u e D w e G 52 D˜ e n F u n w n G ( 6 . 7 ) where D˜ e n 5 F D e n 2 n e 3 r n D e n 0 D e n G . ( 6 . 8 ) The kinematics is subject to 3 u L u compatibility constraints written for all the loops , where we make a reference to Satake’s work . The above should be augmented by 3 u E u constitutive equations connecting the contact force F e and contact mo - ment M e with the relative displacement D u e and relative rotation D w e . Given 3 global equilibrium conditions , we have a total of 3 ~ u V u 2 1 1 u E u 1 u L u ! 5 6 u E u ( 6 . 9 ) equations . Taking note of the Euler relation u V u 2 u E u 1 u L u 5 1 , we see that this budget of equations agrees with the total of 6 u E u unknowns - that is , F e , M e , D u e and D w e - deﬁned on edges of set E . Finally , we note a formal analogy of ~ 6 . 5 ! and ~ 6 . 7 ! to the equilibrium and strain - displacement equations of Cosserat continua Div F s m G 1 F b m G 5 0 F g k G 5 Grad F u w G . ( 6 . 10 ) A similarity of compatibility relations for the graph and the continuum descriptions has also been shown by Satake . 6 . 3 Periodic graphs with topological disorder Randomness may be introduced into periodic networks in various ways . Figure 19 displays two basic possibilities : sub - stitutional disorder and topological disorder . The ﬁrst of these connotes a variability in properties per vertex ~ or node ! , while the second consists in a departure from the pe - riodic topology and is therefore called a topological disorder . There is also a third case , of much more interest in solid state physics : geometric disorder , which involves the variability in the geometry of a network’s structure—like uneven lengths of various bonds—but preserving a topological periodic structure @ 73 # . The topological disorder is typically caused by an incompatibility of crystal - like domains in a granular material . The material may consist of equisized disks , which are organized into regular , periodic arrays , but the fact that they happen to be differently oriented in space causes an irregular structure and network of domain boundaries . As observed earlier in connection with the DE model , the topological disorder leads to a locally inhomogeneous polar , or micropolar , continuum ~ depending on the type of vertex - vertex interactions ! with inhomogeneity varying on the scale of grains . Such a continuum model contains a lot of infor - mation , but , in the ﬁrst place , one wants to establish the effective , in the macroscopic sense , moduli C L eff of the mate - rial . For a non - polar ~ classical ! continuum , these are ob - tained from the periodic boundary conditions on an L 3 L square B in 2D u i ~ x > 1 L > ! 5 u i ~ x > ! 1 « > ij x j t i ~ x > ! 52 t i ~ x > 1 L > ! ; x > P ] B . ( 6 . 11 ) Here e ¯ ij is the macroscopic strain , t i is the traction on the boundary ] B of B , and L > 5 Le > i , with e > i being a unit base vector . The periodicity means that the network topology is modiﬁed so as to repeat itself with some periodicity L in x 1 and x 2 directions , whereby L is usually taken much larger than the typical vertex - vertex spacing ~ or edge length ! . Let us now consider a disordered , planar , granular me - dium , whose microstructural connectivity is modeled by a Poisson - Delaunay planar tessellation graph ; it is generated from a realization of the Poisson point ﬁeld in R 2 , eg , @ 58 # . Now , the periodic conditions ~ 6 . 11 ! require that a periodic network be set up , and this , in turn requires a periodic Pois - son point ﬁeld on the L 3 L square ; topologically , this square is a torus . A typical realization B ~ v ! of a periodic Poisson - Delaunay network , numbering 200 vertices , is shown in Fig . 20 . A set of all such realizations $ B ( v ) ; v P V % , where V is a sample space , forms a random medium B ; a single v indicates one realization of the Poisson point ﬁeld and a chosen assign - ment of spring constants . In actual simulations , only a minute subset of the entire sample space can be investigated , but by the standard Monte Carlo and ergodicity arguments , this subset is representative of the whole system . Thus , al - ready the response of a single network much larger than the grain size is sufﬁcient to gain a good estimate of C L eff ( [ C ijkl eff ) . The ensemble average of this tensor is isotropic for a microstructure of space - homogeneous and isotropic statis - tics , but even one realization of the network should be close to isotropic . Fig . 19 Substitutional a ! versus topological disorder b ! of a hard - core Delaunay network 56 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 The procedure to calculate the effective moduli k and m is as follows : a given B ~ v ! realization of the Delaunay net - work , is subjected , separately , to two tests : a biaxial exten - sion e ¯ 11 5 e ¯ 22 and a shear deformation e ¯ 11 52 e ¯ 22 . Actual equilibrium state is found using a conjugate gradient method . Next , by equating , in each test , the network’s energy to that of a 2D linear elastic equivalent continuum of area V 5 L 2 U 5 V 2 F k« ¯ ii « ¯ jj 1 2 m S « ¯ ij « ¯ ij 2 1 2 « ¯ ii « ¯ jj D G ( 6 . 12 ) the bulk and shear moduli , respectively , can be calculated directly . Repeating this process in a Monte Carlo sense for a number of realizations ~ so as to remove the ﬂuctuations ! , the network’s effective bulk and shear moduli are estimated . In general , effective bulk and shear moduli display con - vex dependence on volume fraction that is characteristic of effective responses of many composite materials , eg @ 74 # . Additionally , we observe a softening of these moduli relative to those corresponding to regular triangular networks - this is caused by the topological disorder . More details on these models , including a consideration of percolation in the case of very high contrast two - phase systems is given in @ 75 , 76 # . Extensive studies of granular materials employing kine - matic rather than periodic boundary conditions and truly large particle numbers , up to 50 , 000 , were carried out by Rothenburg and co - workers , see @ 77 – 80 # . Their solution method was based on the already mentioned quasi - static nu - merics of @ 67 # , with focus being , among others , on : homog - enization and bounding via uniform strain or uniform stress assumptions ; circular versus elliptical particles ; and statistics of geometrical quantities and contact displacements under compressive and shearing loading . APPENDIX : PLANAR CONTINUUM ELASTICITY The constitutive relations of a linear elastic , isotropic 3D continuum are « 11 5 1 E 3 D @ s 11 2 n 3 D ~ s 22 1 s 33 ! # « 12 5 1 1 n 3 D E 3 D s 12 ( A . 1 ) together with cyclic permutations 1 ! 2 ! 3 , or , equivalently , s ij 5 l 3 D « kk d ij 1 2 m 3 D « ij i , j , k 5 1 , . . . , 3 . ( A . 2 ) Here E 3 D , n 3 D , l 3 D and m 3 D stand for the conventional 3D Young’s modulus , Poisson’s ratio , and Lame´ constants , all the relations between these moduli being well known . On the other hand , in 2D ~ or planar ! elasticity , there is no x 3 direction and so « 11 , « 22 , « 12 are the only strains and s 11 , s 22 , s 12 the only stresses . Thus , we have « 11 5 1 E @ s 11 2 ns 22 # « 12 5 1 1 n E s 12 ( A . 3 ) with cyclic permutation 1 ! 2 , or , equivalently , « ij 5 1 1 n E F s ij 2 n 1 1 ns kk d ij G i , j , k 5 1 , . . . , 2 . ( A . 4 ) In these equations , we introduce a rule of writing the 2D moduli without any subscripts , so that E and n stand for the 2D ( or planar ) Young’s modulus and 2D Poisson’s ratio @ 16 # ; some authors @ 81 # use the term area moduli . Now , in analogy to ~ A . 2 ! above , we introduce the 2D l and m moduli by writing s ij 5 l« kk d ij 1 2 m« ij ( A . 5 ) and ﬁnd the relations E 5 4 m l 1 m l 1 2 m n 5 l l 1 2 m . ( A . 6 ) Just like in the 3D elasticity , from three tests—uniaxial stress , hydrostatic stress , and simple shearing stress—one can work out basic inequalities that hold between these pla - nar moduli l 1 2 m . 0 l 1 m . 0 m . 0 ( A . 7 ) whereby we note that the planar shear modulus is given by the same formula in 2D as in 3D . If m obeys the third of these inequalities , the ﬁrst one is a consequence of the sec - ond and can be dropped . It is easy to see that , Poisson’s ratio given by ( A . 6 ) 2 assumes the value 2 1 , and , since ] n ] l 5 2 m ~ l 1 2 m ! 2 . 0 ( A . 8 ) n increases monotonically on any vector q parallel to the l axis in the l , m - plane , tending towards 1 with 2 1 increasing distance from Q . Thus we note that n ranges from 2 1 through 1 1 , in contradistinction to n 3 D , which is bounded by 2 1 and 1 / 2 . Now , an inspection of ~ A . 1 ! 2 immediately Fig . 20 A periodic Poisson - Delaunay network with 200 vertices Appl Mech Rev vol 55 , no 1 , January 2002 Ostoja - Starzewski : Lattice models in micromechanics 57 reveals that the planar shear modulus does not change , while applying the concept of bulk modulus to relations ~ A . 1 ! 1 , we infer the planar bulk modulus k , that is k 5 E 2 ~ 1 2 n ! m 5 E 2 ~ 1 1 n ! . ( A . 9 ) Two other very useful relations linking these two - dimensional moduli E , n , k , and m can readily be inferred 4 E 5 1 k 1 1 m n 5 k 2 m k 1 m . ( A . 10 ) Upon substitution of ~ A . 5 ! into the balance law s ij , j 5 0 , we ﬁnd a planar Navier’s equation for the displacement u i ~ see also , @ 45 , 46 # ! m u i , jj 1 k u j , ji 5 0 . ( A . 11 ) We now examine the relation of planar elasticity to two well known special cases of 3D elasticity . Plane strain In that case , one requires u 3 5 0 in Eqs . ~ A . 1 ! – ~ A . 2 ! along with the independence of all the ﬁelds with respect to the x 3 direction , so that « 33 5 « 31 5 « 32 5 0 and « 11 5 1 E 3 D @ ~ 1 2 n 3 D 2 s 11 2 ~ n 3 D 2 n 3 D 2 ! s 22 « 12 5 1 1 n 3 D E 3 D s 12 ( A . 12 ) again with the cyclic permutation 1 ! 2 . A comparison with Eq . ~ A . 3 ! readily shows that the following relationships be - tween the 2D and the 3D moduli hold 1 E 5 1 1 n 3 D 2 E 3 D n E 5 n 3 D 1 n 3 D 2 E 3 D 1 1 n E 5 1 1 n 3 D E 3 D . ( A . 13 ) This is a mapping of two constants onto two constants , so that only two relations of the above three are independent , and it is easy to check that Eq . ~ A . 13 ! 3 is redundant . Of particular interest is the relation between the plane strain Poisson’s ratio and the 3D Poisson’s ratio n 5 n 3 D 1 2 n 3 D . ( A . 14 ) Clearly , the case of n 51 1 represents a planar incompress - ible material corresponding to the 3D incompressible mate - rial of n 3 D 5 1 / 2 . Plane stress In that case , one requires s 33 5 s 31 5 s 32 5 0 and the inde - pendence of all the ﬁelds with respect to the x 3 direction , which leads to « 11 5 1 E @ s 11 2 ns 22 # « 12 5 1 1 n E s 12 ( A . 15 ) with cyclic permutation 1 ! 2 . A comparison with Eq . ~ A . 3 ! readily shows that the following relationships between the two - dimensional ~ plane - stress ! and the three - dimensional moduli hold 1 E 5 1 E 3 D n E 5 n 3 D E 3 D 1 1 n E 5 1 1 n 3 D E 3 D ( A . 16 ) The third of these relations is redundant , but the most impor - tant thing is that E 5 E 3 D n 5 n 3 D m 5 m 3 D 5 E 2 ~ 1 1 n ! ( A . 17 ) while the 2D bulk modulus k is k 5 E 2 ~ 1 2 n ! ( A . 18 ) Note that Eqs . ~ A . 9 ! – ~ A . 10 ! hold again . Relations of planar isotropic elasticity shown here may be generalized to orthotropic and general anisotropic materials .
