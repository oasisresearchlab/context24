We conducted a retrospective cohort study among household contacts of primary cases defined as children and adolescents aged 7A19 years with laboratory evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection acquired during an overnight camp outbreak . Among household contacts , we defined secondary cases using the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists definition . Among 526 household contacts of 224 primary cases , 48 secondary cases were identified , corresponding to a secondary attack rate of 9 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 7 % – 12 % ) . Our findings show that children and adolescents can transmit SARS - CoV - 2 to adult contacts and other children in a household setting . for use under a CC0 license .

Some studies suggest low secondary transmission from young children . 6 - 8 However , closure of schools and other youth - centric settings early in the pandemic combined with mitigation measures and selective testing limit the reliability of these conclusions . 9 , 10 Transmission to adults is of particular concern given the higher risk for severe illness from COVID - 19 in older adults . 1 , 3 Here we describe secondary attack rates ( SAR ) among household contacts of children and adolescents who acquired SARS - CoV - 2 infection during an outbreak at an overnight camp in June 2020 . 13 Methods During July 17 – August 24 , 2020 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) collaborated with local and state health departments to contact all camp attendees and their parents or guardians for a phone interview . Using a structured questionnaire , we collected demographic and clinical characteristics of camp attendees , SARS - CoV - 2 testing history , and a list of household contacts . We conducted a retrospective cohort study among household contacts exposed to camp attendees aged 7 – 19 years with self - reported evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection by molecular or antigen testing . We interviewed each household contact to obtain dates of exposure to the camp attendee during their infectious period , as well as SARS - CoV - 2 testing history , presence of COVID - 19 symptoms , and potential community exposures . COVID - 19 cases among camp attendees were defined as those with self - reported laboratory evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection by molecular or antigen testing . Among household contacts ( i . e . , persons who stayed ≥1 night in the household during the camp attendee case’s infectious period ) , COVID - 19 cases and non - cases were categorized using the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists definitions for use under a CC0 license .

Hereafter , we define a “primary case” as a camp attendee with the earliest onset date in the household and a “secondary case” as a household contact with confirmed or probable COVID - 19 . If multiple camp attendee cases resided in the same household , they were defined as coprimary cases . We included households for which household contacts provided sufficient information for secondary case or non - case classification and excluded households in which the household contact case had a symptom onset date prior to or < 2 days after the symptom onset date of the camp attendee . We described frequencies of categorical variables ( i . e . , demographic and clinical characteristics for primary and secondary cases , household interactions , and potential community exposures ) and median , interquartile ranges ( IQR ) , and ranges for quantitative variables ( i . e . , age ) . We used the Pearson’s chi - squared test and the Wilcoxon rank - sum test to compare the sex and age of household contacts who were interviewed with those who were not , respectively . We calculated the overall SAR as the percentage of secondary cases among all household contacts , excluding household contacts who were not tested for SARS - CoV - 2 . The 95 % CI of these percentages was calculated using the Wilson score interval . This activity was reviewed by CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health and was conducted consistently with applicable federal laws and CDC policy as defined in 45 C . F . R . part 46 , 21 C . F . R . part 56 ; 42 U . S . C . 241 ( d ) ; A5 U . S . C . 552a ; 44 U . S . C . 3501 et seq . For camp attendees aged < 18 years , we obtained parental or guardian permission as well as verbal assent from the camp attendee . Results We identified 224 primary cases in 194 households with 526 household contacts ( Figure 1 ) . In total , there were 163 households with one primary case and 456 household contacts , 30 households with two for use under a CC0 license . This article is a US Government work .

The 224 primary cases had a median age of 14 years ; 115 ( 51 % ) were female , and 198 ( 88 % ) were non - Hispanic White ( Table 1 ) . Of these , 184 ( 82 % ) were symptomatic , reporting constitutional symptoms ( 153 ; 68 % ) , upper respiratory symptoms ( 110 ; 49 % ) , new olfactory or taste disorders ( 64 ; 29 % ) , gastrointestinal symptoms ( 49 ; 22 % ) , or lower respiratory symptoms ( 34 ; 15 % ) . None of the primary cases were hospitalized . The 526 household contacts had a median age of 46 years ( range , 1 – 83 ) ; 262 ( 50 % ) were female ( Table 1 ) . Among the 526 household contacts , 351 ( 67 % ) were parents , 161 ( 31 % ) were siblings , 11 ( 2 % ) were extended family members , and 3 ( 1 % ) were non - familial contacts . Both the age and sex distribution of the household contacts who were interviewed ( n = 446 ) and were not interviewed ( n = 80 ) was similar ( age : p - value = 0 . 68 ; sex : p - value = 0 . 90 ) . Among 434 ( 84 % ) interviewed household contacts , 400 ( 90 % ) were non - Hispanic White , 74 ( 14 % ) had at least one underlying medical condition ; among contacts aged ≥22 years , 92 % ( 255 / 276 ) reported college education or higher . We identified 48 household contacts as secondary cases ( Table 2 ) ; 25 ( 52 % ) were male , and 44 ( 92 % ) were symptomatic ( Table 2 ) . None of the 7 secondary cases among contacts aged < 18 years were hospitalized ; 4 ( 10 % ) of 41 secondary cases among household contacts aged ≥18 years ( aged 49 – 77 years ) were hospitalized . Of these 4 hospitalized contacts , hospital length of stay varied from 5 – 11 days , and 2 ( 50 % ) had no underlying medical conditions . The SAR was 9 % ( 48 / 526 ; 95 % CI , 7 % – 12 % ) . Among household contacts who reported molecular or antigen SARS - CoV - 2 testing , the SAR was 12 % ( 46 / 377 ; 95 % CI , 9 % – 16 % ) . Five ( 10 % ) of 48 secondary cases compared with 130 ( 33 % ) of 398 non - case household contacts reported potential community exposures . Secondary cases occurred in 35 ( 18 % ) of 194 households ( Figure 2 ) ; among households with secondary cases , the SAR was 45 % ( 48 / 107 ; 95 % CI , 36 – 54 % ) . for use under a CC0 license .

Previous household transmission investigations found an overall SAR ranging from 11 % – 32 % , although these studies focused on adult primary cases and tested all household contacts for SARS - CoV - 2 . 10 , 11 , 25 - 28 Our finding of a 12 % SAR among tested household contacts is in the lower end of the SAR range reported by other studies . However , due to a known camp exposure , many primary cases isolated or wore masks upon returning home . Additionally , not all household contacts were systematically tested . Furthermore , 20 % of the primary cases had symptom onset while at camp . This is notable given laboratory and epidemiologic evidence indicating that transmission risk is highest during the pre - symptomatic and early onset period of illness . 17 , 18 In comparison , an investigation of childcare facility - associated outbreaks with pediatric primary cases noted a 26 % SAR among contacts . 13 This investigation includes a large cohort of children and adolescents identified as primary cases in their households and adds valuable evidence for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission from children and adolescents . However , our findings are subject to at least three limitations . First , this was a retrospective observational study with selection and recall bias . Second , the participating household contacts were predominantly non - Hispanic White with a college degree and therefore not representative of the general population . Third , differential misclassification leading to SAR underestimation might have occurred as not all household contacts were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 , test results were self - reported , and many contacts were tested only once and could have been tested too early . Alternatively , SAR could for use under a CC0 license . This article is a US Government work .

In this investigation , school - aged children and adolescents with COVID - 19 transmitted SARS - CoV - 2 to other children and adults in the household setting , with 10 % of secondary adult cases requiring hospitalization . These findings highlight the importance of implementing effective public health guidelines to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in all settings , including settings with children . Children and adolescents should remain at home , ≥6 feet apart from contacts , and have a separate sleeping space and bathroom following a known COVID - 19 exposure or diagnosis . In communities with active SARS - CoV - 2 spread , and particularly in congregate settings , children and adolescents should wear masks if safe to do so and maintain at least six feet distance from others to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . 38 , 39 for use under a CC0 license .
