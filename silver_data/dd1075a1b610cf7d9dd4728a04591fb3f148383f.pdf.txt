Why certain species , such as zebrafish , 3 possess a high regenerative capacity , but not others , is poorly understood ( 1 ) . Fibrous scar 4 formation is considered to be a major factor in limiting axon regeneration in the adult 5 mammalian CNS ( 2 ) . Several scar components , such as myelin - associated factors , basal 6 lamina components , and high molecular weight chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans ( CSPGs ) , 7 have been identified as inhibitors of axonal regrowth through mechanisms including growth 8 cone collapse , repellence or entrapment , and prevention of inflammation resolution ( 3 - 5 ) . 9 However , removing these extracellular matrix ( ECM ) factors results in only modest 10 regeneration , suggesting that critical molecules and mechanisms contributing to 11 regeneration failure remain to be discovered ( 6 - 8 ) . The CNS scar may inhibit axon growth 12 not only through its biochemical composition , but also by changes in local mechanical 13 properties of the microenvironment ( 9 - 11 ) . However , in vivo evidence for a causal 14 relationship between scar tissue mechanics and regenerative success is lacking . Moreover , 15 molecular factors that influence the mechanical properties of CNS scars have not been 16 identified . 17 Unlike mammals , zebrafish establish an axon growth - conducive ECM after CNS injury , 18 leading to recovery of swimming function both at larval and adult stages ( 12 - 16 ) . It remains 19 obscure as to why injury - associated ECM deposits inhibit axon regeneration in the 20 mammalian CNS , but not in zebrafish . Here , we identify small leucine - rich proteoglycans 21 ( SLRPs ) as ECM factors which drive CNS healing toward inhibitory scarring . We 22 demonstrate that Chondroadherin , Fibromodulin , Lumican , and Prolargin are enriched in 23 human but not zebrafish CNS lesions . Increasing the abundance of SLRPs in the zebrafish 24 injury ECM inhibits axon regeneration and functional recovery . Mechanistically , we find that 25 SLRPs confer structural and mechanical properties to the lesion environment that render it 26 adverse to axon growth . This identifies SLRPs as previously unknown inhibitory ECM 27 4 factors in the human CNS that impair axon regeneration by altering tissue mechanics and 28 structure . Targeting SLRPs therefore presents itself as a potential therapeutic strategy to 29 promote axon growth across CNS lesions . 30 31 RESULTS 32 Matrisome dynamics of zebrafish spinal cord regeneration 33 In order to identify factors that confer axon growth - limiting properties to CNS scars by 34 altering tissue mechanics , we first set out to map the changes in ECM composition in a 35 regeneration context . We applied label - free mass spectrometry ( MS ) - based quantitative 36 proteomics to a larval zebrafish spinal cord injury ( SCI ) model , which allows axon 37 regeneration and functional recovery within two days post - lesion ( dpl ) ( Fig . 1A , B ) ( 13 , 17 ) . 38 Proteomic profiling of the lesion site at 1 dpl and 2 dpl as well as corresponding age - 39 matched unlesioned control tissue identified 6 , 062 unique proteins ( Fig . S1A , B ) . Differential 40 abundance analysis ( FDR < 0 . 1 , | FC | ≥ 1 . 3 , s 0 = 0 . 1 ) revealed 877 proteins whose 41 abundance was altered in 1 dpl compared to unlesioned control samples ( 556 up - and 321 42 down - regulated ; Fig . S1C ) . The abundance of 570 proteins differed between 2 dpl and 43 unlesioned control samples ( 388 up - and 182 down - regulated ; Fig . S1D ) . Reactome 44 analysis of enriched proteins resulted in several ECM - associated terms being 45 overrepresented at 1 dpl and 2 dpl ( Fig . S1E ) . We thus examined the matrisome , which can 46 be subdivided into core matrisome ( glycoproteins , collagens , proteoglycans ) , matrisome - 47 associated ( ECM affiliated proteins , ECM regulators , secreted factors ) , and putative 48 matrisome proteins ( Fig . 1C , D ) ( 18 ) . Among those matrisome proteins which exhibited a 49 high abundance at 1 dpl were several proteins that have previously been reported to show 50 increased expression after SCI in zebrafish , including Aspn , Cthrc1a , Col5a1 , Col6a2 , 51 Col12a1a , Col12a1b , Fn1a , Fn1b , Tnc , and Thbs2b ( 12 - 14 , 19 ) . In addition , we identified 52 immune system - related factors , such as cathepsins , serpins , galectins , and interleukins , 53 which is consistent with the critical role of injury - activated macrophages at this stage of 54 5 regeneration ( 20 , 21 ) . At 2 dpl , the number of matrisome proteins exhibiting an altered 55 abundance decreased by 28 % , compared to 1 dpl . Comparing differentially regulated 56 proteins across time points showed that 30 such matrisome proteins were common to 1 dpl 57 and 2 dpl ( asterisks in Fig . 1C , D ) , including proteins previously implicated in axon growth 58 promotion or guidance : Col12a1a , Col12a1b , Fn1a , Fn1b , Tnc , Cthrc1a , and Thbs1a ( 12 , 59 13 , 19 , 22 - 28 ) . 34 proteins with altered abundance were unique to 1 dpl , and 16 proteins to 60 2 dpl . Among the uniquely differentially regulated matrisome proteins at 1 dpl , we identified 61 nine immune system - related and coagulation factors ( Ctsa , Ctsla , Cts , F2 , Il16 , Lgals9l3 , 62 Plg , Serpind2fb , Serpine2 ) , consistent with the initial blood clotting reaction and transient 63 proinflammatory phase after SCI in zebrafish ( 20 , 29 ) . To further validate our MS results , 64 we examined whether changes in mRNA levels accompanied the alterations in protein 65 abundance . We performed in situ hybridization ( ISH ) to analyze the expression of genes 66 coding for 30 differentially regulated matrisome proteins which exhibited high abundance at 67 1 dpl . Transcripts of all analyzed genes were locally upregulated in the lesion site compared 68 to both adjacent unlesioned trunk tissue and unlesioned age - matched controls ( Fig . S1F ; 69 data not shown ) . This reinforces the findings of our proteomics profiling . Collectively , these 70 data identify the dynamics of the matrisome landscape after SCI in a vertebrate species 71 which exhibits a high regenerative capacity for the CNS . 72 73 Distinct matrisome signatures after SCI in rat and zebrafish 74 To identify interspecies differences in the ECM composition that could account for the ability 75 of severed axons to regrow after CNS injury , we compared the zebrafish proteomics dataset 76 with that of Sprague - Dawley rats at seven days post - contusion SCI ( 30 ) . We first screened 77 for matrisome proteins that were enriched in the zebrafish lesion site ( FDR < 0 . 1 , FC ≥ 1 . 3 ) 78 but down - regulated or not significantly regulated after SCI in rat ( FDR < 0 . 1 , 79 FC ≤ - 1 . 3 | n . s . ) . This identified four proteins ( Fig . S2A ) . By contrast , 61 matrisome proteins 80 were down - regulated or not significantly regulated after SCI in zebrafish ( FDR < 0 . 1 , 81 6 FC ≤ - 1 . 3 | n . s . ) but enriched in the rat lesion site ( FDR < 0 . 1 , FC ≥ 1 . 3 ) ( Fig . 2A ) . This 82 suggests that the regeneration - permissive properties of the zebrafish injury ECM can be 83 attributed to the absence of axon growth - limiting components rather than the presence of 84 species - specific growth - promoting factors . Indeed , among the differentially regulated 85 matrisome proteins that showed low abundance in the zebrafish spinal lesion site were 16 86 components of the neurite growth - inhibitory basal lamina ( 4 , 31 , 32 ) . These include type IV 87 collagens , laminins , nidogens , heparan sulfate proteoglycans , Fbln1 , and Sparc . 88 Quantitative RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) confirmed that the expression of these basal lamina 89 components was not upregulated in the zebrafish spinal lesion site at 1 dpl ( Fig . S2B ) . 90 Similarly , anti - Col IV immunoreactivity was also not locally increased at 1 dpl ( Fig . S2C ) . 91 Thus , basal lamina networks are not a principal constituent of the zebrafish injury ECM . 92 These data demonstrate the value of cross - species comparative approaches in identifying 93 inhibitory components of the mammalian injury ECM . The comparative dataset further 94 revealed seven members of the highly conserved small leucine - rich proteoglycan ( SLRP ) 95 family to be enriched in the rat spinal lesion site but down - regulated or not significantly 96 regulated after SCI in zebrafish , namely Chondroadherin ( Chad ) , Lumican ( Lum ) , 97 Osteoglycin ( Ogna ) , Decorin ( Dcn ) , Fibromodulin ( Fmoda , Fmodb ) , and Prolargin ( Prelp ) 98 ( Fig . 2A ) . Assessment of additional proteomics profiles showed comparable enrichment of 99 these SLRPs in rats at seven days and eight weeks post - contusion SCI ( Fig . S2D ) ( 30 , 33 , 100 34 ) . Interestingly , Asporin ( Aspn ) was the only SLRP family member which exhibited an 101 increased abundance after SCI in both rat and zebrafish ( Fig . S2D ) . To ascertain whether 102 the low protein abundance of SLRPs in the zebrafish spinal lesion site is also reflected at 103 the transcriptional level , we performed qRT - PCR . This revealed that with the exception of 104 aspn , expression of all 21 SLRPs present in the zebrafish genome was not increased at 105 1 dpl as compared to unlesioned controls ( Fig . 2B ; Fig . S2E ) . Average fold changes of aspn , 106 chad , dcn , fmoda , fmodb , lum , ogna , and prelp , as determined by qRT - PCR , correlated with 107 the MS data ( Pearson correlation , R 2 = 0 . 9443 ) , thus further validating our proteomics 108 7 profile ( Fig . S2F ) . Additionally , ISH showed upregulation of aspn transcripts in the lesion 109 site at 1 dpl while chad , dcn , fmoda , fmodb , lum , ogna , and prelp expression was not locally 110 increased ( Fig . 2C ; Fig . S2G ) . Altogether , these data reveal an opposing abundance of 111 Chad , Lum , Ogn , Dcn , Fmod , and Prelp in the spinal lesion site of rat and zebrafish , 112 respectively . 113 114 SLRPs are abundant in human CNS lesions 115 We next sought to determine whether SLRPs are abundant in the injured human CNS . In 116 surgically removed brain tissue samples from six patients with traumatic brain injury or brain 117 surgery , we detected prominent anti - CHAD , anti - FMOD , anti - LUM , and anti - PRELP 118 immunoreactivity in areas of scarring caused by contusion , local hemorrhage , or previous 119 surgery ( Fig . 3 ; Fig . S3A , B ; Table S1 ) . By contrast , negligible immunoreactivity was 120 observed in a reference group of six human brain autopsy and biopsy controls without signs 121 of fibrous scarring ( Fig . S3C , D ; Table S1 ) . We next analyzed post - mortem spinal cord tissue 122 from six patients with traumatic SCI . SCI occurred in the cervical region through 123 compression or contusion , and patients survived between 9 and 111 days after injury ( Table 124 S2 ) . We found a localized increase in immunoreactivity in the lesion epicenter , as compared 125 to rostral or caudal control segments of the same patient , for anti - LUM in five out of six 126 cases , for anti - PRELP and anti - FMOD in four out of six cases , and anti - CHAD in two out of 127 six cases ( Fig . S4 ; Table S3 ) . The enrichment of SLRPs is therefore a feature of human 128 CNS lesions . 129 130 SLRPs are inhibitory to CNS axon regeneration 131 Since CHAD , FMOD , LUM , and PRELP proteins are highly abundant in the injury ECM of 132 poorly regenerating humans but are absent in zebrafish with a high regenerative capacity 133 for the CNS , we hypothesized that SLRPs inhibit regeneration . We therefore investigated 134 the effect of increasing SLRP protein levels in the zebrafish injury ECM on axonal regrowth 135 8 and functional recovery after SCI . We generated doxycycline ( DOX ) - inducible Tet - 136 responder zebrafish lines to target chad , fmoda , lum , or prelp expression specifically to 137 pdgfrb + myoseptal and perivascular cells when used in combination with a pdgfrb promotor - 138 driven Tet - activator line ( henceforth also referred to as pdgfrb : SLRP ) . Additionally , we 139 created a Tet - responder line for the selective induction of aspn to control for potential 140 overexpression artifacts of SLRPs . pdgfrb + fibroblast - like cells are rapidly recruited in 141 response to SCI and constitute a major source of ECM in the lesion site ( 12 ) . Moreover , 142 qRT - PCR on GFP + cells isolated from uninjured pdgfrb : GFP transgenic animals by FACS 143 showed that pdgfrb + cells express aspn , chad , fmoda , lum , and prelp under physiological 144 conditions ( Fig . S5A ) . This makes pdgfrb + cells an ideal target for manipulating the ECM in 145 the zebrafish spinal lesion site . Induction of aspn - mCherry , chad - mCherry , fmoda - mCherry , 146 lum - mCherry , or prelp - mCherry fusions in pdgfrb : SLRP transgenics resulted in labeling of 147 the myosepta and vasculature in unlesioned animals ( Fig . S5B ) . At 1 dpl , mCherry 148 fluorescence signal accumulated in the lesion site , indicating enrichment of the secreted 149 proteins ( Fig . 4A ) . pdgfrb : SLRP transgenics thereby enable the experimental increase of 150 SLRP protein levels in the injury ECM after SCI . To assess whether axon regeneration is 151 affected in pdgfrb : SLRP transgenics , we determined the thickness of the axonal bridge that 152 reconnects the severed spinal cord ends in live elavl3 : GFP - F transgenic animals at 2 dpl , a 153 measure that correlates with the recovery of swimming function ( Fig . 4B ) ( 20 ) . We found 154 that the average axonal bridge thickness was reduced by 41 - 52 % when Chad , Fmoda , Lum , 155 or Prelp was targeted to the injury ECM , as compared to their controls ( Fig . 4B’ ; Fig . S5C ) . 156 Moreover , quantification of swimming distance at 2 dpl showed that pdgfrb : SLRP 157 transgenics exhibited worse functional recovery than their controls ( 30 - 42 % reduced 158 swimming distance ) ( Fig . 4B’’ ) . Notably , targeting Aspn to the injury ECM had no effect on 159 axon regeneration and recovery of swimming function , thus supporting the specificity of the 160 observed phenotypes ( Fig . 4B’ , B’’ ; Fig . S5C ) . Our data therefore identify Chad , Fmod , Lum , 161 and Prelp as ECM factors that inhibit CNS axon regeneration in vivo . 162 9 SLRPs do not directly act on neurons to inhibit neurite extension 163 To elucidate the mechanism by which SLRPs inhibit neurite growth , we first examined a 164 potential direct interaction with neurons or the axonal growth cone . We used a Xla . Tubb 165 promoter - driven Tet - activator zebrafish line to target chad , fmoda , lum , or prelp expression 166 specifically to neurons ( referred to as Xla . Tubb : SLRP ) . In uninjured animals , the SLRP - 167 mCherry fusion proteins were mainly confined to the spinal cord and showed negligible 168 fluorescence signal in the lesion site at 1 dpl ( Fig . S5D , E ) . Thus , cell type - specific 169 manipulations allow us to distinguish between direct and indirect actions of SLRPs on axon 170 growth in vivo . We found that targeting chad , fmoda , lum , or prelp to neurons did not impair 171 axon regeneration , determined by measuring the axonal bridge thickness in live elavl3 : GFP - 172 F transgenic animals at 2 dpl ( Fig . S5F ) . To corroborate these findings , we assessed neurite 173 outgrowth of adult primary murine dorsal root ganglion neurons on SLRP protein - coated 174 substrates . Although a mixture of high molecular weight CSPGs potently reduced the 175 average neurite length by 66 % , a combination of human CHAD , FMOD , LUM , and PRELP 176 proteins had no effect ( Fig . S5G ) . These data demonstrate that SLRPs inhibit axon growth 177 indirectly . 178 179 SLRPs do not prevent inflammation resolution 180 In order to test whether the presence of SLRPs in the injury ECM delays inflammation 181 resolution , we analyzed the clearance of neutrophils and expression of the proinflammatory 182 cytokine il1b , both of which processes must be tightly controlled for successful axon 183 regeneration ( 3 , 20 ) . In larval zebrafish , the influx of Mpx + neutrophils peaks as early as two 184 hours following SCI , after which cell numbers rapidly decrease in the lesion site ( 20 ) . We 185 found that targeting Chad , Fmoda , Lum , or Prelp to the injury ECM in pdgfrb : SLRP 186 transgenic animals did not lead to a higher number of Mpx + neutrophils in the lesion site at 187 1 dpl ( Fig . S6A ) . Consistent with this , transcript levels of neutrophil - derived il1b were not 188 increased in the lesion site of pdgfrb : SLRP transgenic animals at 1 dpl ( determined by qRT - 189 10 PCR ; Fig . S6B ) ( 20 ) . Altogether , this suggests that the inhibition of axon regeneration by 190 SLRPs does not occur via the prevention of inflammation resolution . 191 192 SLRPs do not alter the fibroblast response 193 We next sought to determine whether SLRPs inhibit axon regeneration by altering the 194 fibroblast response in pdgfrb : SLRP transgenic animals . Using the TUNEL assay , we found 195 that induction of chad , fmoda , lum , or prelp did not lead to increased cell death of pdgfrb + 196 cells ( Fig . S7A , B ) . Furthermore , we did not detect significant changes in the area coverage 197 of pdgfrb + fibroblast - like cells in the lesion site at 1 dpl , indicating that their recruitment was 198 largely unperturbed ( Fig . S7C ) . Finally , we did not detect differences in the composition of 199 the injury ECM between pdgfrb : SLRP transgenics and controls at 1 dpl ( FDR < 0 . 1 , 200 | FC | ≥ 1 . 3 ) , as revealed by MS - based quantitative proteomics ( Fig . S8A - C ) . To further 201 validate the MS results , we used ISH to evaluate the expression pattern and transcript levels 202 of five genes coding for matrisome proteins that showed the most substantial evidence of 203 regulation in each experimental condition . Consistent with the MS analysis , ISH signals in 204 the lesion site were comparable between controls and pdgfrb : SLRP transgenics for all 25 205 genes analyzed ( Fig . S8D ) . We thus conclude that targeting SLRPs to pdgfrb + fibroblasts 206 does not lead to major changes in the biochemical composition of the injury ECM . 207 208 Fmod , Lum , and Prelp modify the structural properties of the lesion environment 209 SLRPs play instructive and structural roles in ECM organization and assembly to control the 210 strength and biomechanical properties of tissues ( 35 ) . We thus hypothesized that SLRPs 211 alter the structural and mechanical properties of the injury ECM , thereby making it hostile to 212 axon regeneration . In order to assess this in vivo , we first utilized cross - polarized optical 213 coherence tomography ( CP - OCT ) . CP - OCT reports on relative changes in the polarization 214 of incident light and can provide additional contrast to the native tissue based on its 215 structural differences , including ECM structure ( 36 , 37 ) . Consistent with the changes in 216 11 tissue structure which occur after CNS injury , the co - polarization ratio ( ratio of preserved 217 polarization to total reflectivity ) prominently increased in the zebrafish spinal lesion site at 218 1 dpl , as compared to adjacent uninjured trunk tissue ( Fig . 5A , B ) . Targeting Chad to the 219 injury ECM ( analyzed in pdgfrb : SLRP transgenics ) did not alter the co - polarization ratio in 220 the lesion site at 1 dpl , as compared to controls ( Fig . 5B ) . By contrast , an increase in the 221 co - polarization ratio was observed when Fmoda , Lum , or Prelp were targeted to the injury 222 ECM ( control Fmoda : 0 . 709 ± 0 . 008 , Fmoda : 0 . 750 ± 0 . 006 ; control Lum : 0 . 702 ± 0 . 010 , Lum : 223 0 . 733 ± 0 . 005 ; control Prelp : 0 . 713 ± 0 . 006 , Prelp : 0 . 738 ± 0 . 004 ; Fig . 5B ) . Hence , the 224 presence of Fmod , Lum , and Prelp in the injury ECM coincides with alterations in the 225 structural properties of the lesion environment and impaired axonal regrowth after SCI . 226 227 Lum and Prelp modify the mechanical properties of the lesion environment 228 We next explored whether the observed structural alterations relate to changes in the 229 mechanical properties of the lesion environment . To test this in vivo , we utilized confocal 230 Brillouin microscopy ( BM ) , a non - invasive , label - free , and all - optical method for assessing 231 viscoelastic properties of biological samples in three dimensions ( 38 - 40 ) . BM measures an 232 inelastic scattering process of incident light ( photons ) by density fluctuations ( acoustic 233 phonons ) in the sample , called Brillouin scattering . The energy transfer between the photons 234 and acoustic phonons occurring during the scattering process can be quantified as the 235 Brillouin frequency shift ( ν (cid:2886) ) , which depends on the material’s elastic properties , denoted by 236 the longitudinal modulus ( 𝑀 ’ ) . ν (cid:2886) is proportional to the square root of 𝑀 ’ , which describes a 237 material’s elastic deformability under a distinct type of mechanical loading ( i . e . , longitudinal 238 compressibility ) . Notably , ν (cid:2886) has been shown in vivo to be sensitive to changes in the 239 mechanical properties of the ECM during both physiological and pathological processes 240 ( 41 - 43 ) . We acquired Brillouin images of the region in the spinal lesion site through which 241 the regenerating axons preferentially grow at 1 dpl ( Fig . 5A , C ) . Targeting Chad or Fmoda 242 to the injury ECM ( analyzed in pdgfrb : SLRP transgenics ) did not alter ν (cid:2886) of the lesion site 243 12 ( Fig . 5C ) . By contrast , a decrease of ν (cid:2886) was observed when Lum or Prelp were targeted to 244 the injury ECM ( control Lum : ( 5 . 324 ± 0 . 004 ) GHz , Lum : ( 5 . 298 ± 0 . 006 ) GHz ; control Prelp : 245 ( 5 . 321 ± 0 . 005 ) GHz , Prelp : ( 5 . 295 ± 0 . 005 ) GHz ; Fig . 5C ) . This suggests that Lum and 246 Prelp increase the tissue compressibility of the local microenvironment in the spinal lesion 247 site . 248 ν (cid:2886) depends not only on 𝑀 ’ but also on the refractive index ( 𝑛 ) and density ( 𝜌 ) of the 249 sample in the focal volume ( Fig . S9A ) . To exclude the possibility that the observed changes 250 in ν (cid:2886) are solely due to differences in 𝑛 , we quantified its local distribution in the lesion site in 251 vivo using optical diffraction tomography ( ODT ) ( Fig . S9B ) . This revealed 𝑛(cid:3364) 252 = 1 . 3628 ± 0 . 0005 in pdgfrb : lum transgenics , and 𝑛(cid:3364) = 1 . 3636 ± 0 . 0005 in control animals . In 253 pdgfrb : prelp transgenics , we measured 𝑛(cid:3364) = 1 . 3635 ± 0 . 0005 and 𝑛(cid:3364) = 1 . 3621 ± 0 . 0003 for 254 their respective control animals . To estimate the impact of the uncertainties in 𝑛(cid:3364) and 𝜈 (cid:2886) (cid:3364)(cid:3364)(cid:3364) on 255 𝑀 ’ in our experimental framework , we employed Gaussian propagation of uncertainty ( Fig . 256 S9C ) . This showed that the uncertainty in 𝑛 is overall contributing less to the propagated 257 uncertainty in 𝑀 ’ than the one of 𝜈 (cid:2886) for the values reported above . Furthermore , we found 258 that a relative change in 𝑛 contributes less to a relative change in 𝑀 ’ than a relative change 259 in 𝜈 (cid:2886) ( Fig . S9D ) . We conclude that the differences in 𝑀 ’ between control and pdgfrb : SLRP 260 transgenic animals stem primarily from the observed changes in 𝜈 (cid:2886) rather than 𝑛 , including 261 respective uncertainties . Hence , the longitudinal moduli with respective propagated 262 uncertainties of 𝑛 , 𝜈 (cid:2886) , refractive index increment of the dry mass content (cid:4666)𝛼(cid:4667) , and the partial 263 specific volume of the dry mass content (cid:4666)𝜃(cid:4667) for the different conditionals are calculated to 264 be : 𝑀 (cid:4593) (cid:4666) control (cid:2896)(cid:2931)(cid:2923) (cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:4666) 2 . 396 (cid:3399) 0 . 006 (cid:4667) GPa , 𝑀 (cid:4593) (cid:4666) Lum (cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:4666) 2 . 373 (cid:3399) 0 . 007 (cid:4667) GPa , 265 𝑀 (cid:4593) (cid:3435) control (cid:2900)(cid:2928)(cid:2915)(cid:2922)(cid:2926) (cid:3439) (cid:3404) (cid:4666) 2 . 394 (cid:3399) 0 . 006 (cid:4667) GPa , and 𝑀 (cid:4593) (cid:4666) Prelp (cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:4666) 2 . 370 (cid:3399) 0 . 006 (cid:4667) GPa . 266 Thus , targeting Lum or Prelp to the injury ECM leads to changes in the mechanical 267 properties of the lesion environment and inhibits axon regeneration after SCI . 268 13 DISCUSSION 269 Zebrafish regenerate severed axons and recover function after CNS injury , in stark contrast 270 to mammals including humans . Here , we demonstrate that differences in injury - associated 271 ECM deposits account for the high regenerative capacity of zebrafish . We show that 272 zebrafish establish a favourable composition of the injury ECM , which is characterized by 273 the low abundance of inhibitory molecules rather than the presence of species - specific axon 274 growth - promoting factors . Our study characterizes the SLRPs Chad , Fmod , Lum , and Prelp 275 as such inhibitory molecules that govern the permissiveness of the injury ECM for 276 regeneration . Increasing the abundance of any one of these proteins in the zebrafish injury 277 ECM is sufficient to impair the capacity of severed axons to regrow across CNS lesions . 278 This identifies SLRPs as previously unknown potent inhibitors of CNS axon regeneration in 279 vivo . Furthermore , we demonstrate that CHAD , FMOD , LUM , and PRELP are enriched in 280 the injured human brain and spinal cord . Reducing the abundance of these SLRPs in the 281 injury ECM or attenuating their activity may therefore offer a therapeutic strategy to enhance 282 the permissiveness of CNS lesions for axon growth . 283 So far , much attention has been focused on constituents of the injury ECM that inhibit 284 regeneration through direct interactions with the axonal growth cone ( 4 , 5 ) . However , 285 mechanisms beyond growth cone collapse , repellence , and entrapment are emerging . For 286 example , CSPGs impair inflammation resolution , thereby contributing to a lesion 287 environment hostile to axon growth ( 3 ) . Here , we propose a new class of inhibitors of CNS 288 axon regeneration which function – at least in part – through modifying the structural and 289 mechanical properties of the lesion environment . Our functional experiments support that 290 SLRPs neither inhibit regeneration through i ) direct interactions with the axonal growth cone , 291 nor ii ) prevention of inflammation resolution , nor iii ) altering the composition of the fibroblast - 292 derived injury ECM . Although we cannot exclude that SLRPs influence the availability of 293 neurotrophic factors in the lesion environment , inducing chad , fmod , lum , or prelp 294 expression specifically in neurons did not affect axonal regrowth in vivo , providing evidence 295 14 against this scenario . Utilizing intravital cross - polarized optical coherence tomography and 296 Brillouin microscopy , we show that the presence of individual SLRP family members in the 297 injury ECM leads to changes in the structural ( Fmod , Lum , Prelp ) and mechanical ( Lum , 298 Prelp ; reduced longitudinal modulus ) properties of the lesion environment , which coincides 299 with an impaired regenerative capacity of axons . This indicates that a single ECM factor can 300 direct CNS repair toward inhibitory scarring by altering the structural and mechanical 301 properties of the local microenvironment . 302 Previous studies have shown that CNS injuries in mammals , including humans , are 303 accompanied by a softening of the tissue , whereas the spinal cord of zebrafish stiffens 304 ( increased apparent Young’s modulus ) ( 9 , 11 , 44 ) . This work provides in vivo evidence for 305 a direct relationship between tissue mechanics ( longitudinal modulus ) and regenerative 306 outcome upon CNS injury . Furthermore , we propose LUM and PRELP as causal factors of 307 the differential response in zebrafish and humans . LUM has previously been implicated in 308 the modulation of local tissue stiffness during the induction of fold formation in the 309 developing human neocortex , further supporting a role of SLRPs in CNS tissue mechanics 310 ( 45 ) . Interestingly , using Brillouin microscopy , we found that targeting Chad or Fmod to the 311 injury ECM yielded no effective change of the longitudinal modulus , despite their potency in 312 inhibiting axon regeneration being comparable to Lum and Prelp . Whether other mechanical 313 tissue properties , such as the Young’s modulus , are influenced by Chad , Fmod , Lum , or 314 Prelp awaits further investigation . 315 In conclusion , our data establish the composition , structural organization , and 316 mechanical properties of the ECM as critical determinants of regenerative success after 317 CNS injury . These findings reveal targets to make CNS lesions more conducive to axon 318 growth in mammals , in which regeneration fails . 319 15 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 320 The authors gratefully acknowledge the International Spinal Cord Injury Biobank ( ISCIB ) for 321 generously providing the human spinal cord specimens used in this project and Dr .

The shotgun MS data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium 343 ( http : / / proteomecentral . proteomexchange . org ) via the PRIDE partner repository with the 344 dataset identifier PXD037605 and PXD037590 . 345 16 MATERIAL AND METHODS 346 Human tissue collection and ethical compliance 347 This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Friedrich - Alexander - University 348 ( FAU ) Erlangen - Nürnberg , Germany ( Refs . # 18 - 193 _ 1 - Bio , 193 _ 18B , 92 _ 14B ; brain 349 samples ) and the Ethics Council of the Max Planck Society ( Ref . # 2021 _ 40 ; spinal cord 350 samples ) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki . 351 For brain samples , informed and written consent was obtained from all patients , their 352 parents , or legal representatives if underage . We reviewed clinical and histological data of 353 individuals who underwent surgery for the treatment of their focal drug - resistant epilepsy 354 and were diagnosed with a scar , i . e . , extensively transformed fibrotic and gliotic brain tissue . 355 En bloc resections were carried out and tissue was dissected into 5 mm - thick slices along 356 the anterior - posterior axis . Tissue samples were fixed overnight in 4 % formalin and routinely 357 processed into liquid paraffin . Six patients with histologically proven scarred brain tissue 358 following traumatic brain injury ( TBI , n = 3 ) , or repeated surgery ( re - OP , n = 3 ) were selected 359 for further investigation . Furthermore , a reference group including no - seizure autopsy 360 controls ( n = 2 ) and focal epilepsy patients with a cortical malformation as the primary lesion 361 but no fibrous scarring of resected tissue upon visual inspection ( n = 4 ) was also analyzed . 362 In addition to routine hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) staining , immunohistochemical 363 examination of all surgical brain specimens was performed using the following panel of 364 antibodies : mouse monoclonal anti - NeuN ( clone A - 60 , Millipore Cat # MAB377 ) , mouse 365 monoclonal anti - GFAP ( clone 6F2 , Dako Cat # M0761 ) , and recombinant rabbit monoclonal 366 anti - LUM ( Lumican , Invitrogen Cat # MA5 - 29402 ) . The samples were subsequently digitized 367 using a NanoZoomer Hamamatsu S60 digital slide scanner . 368 Human spinal cord injury ( SCI ) samples , control samples , and related clinical and 369 neuropathological information were obtained from the International Spinal Cord Injury 370 Biobank ( ISCIB ; Vancouver , Canada ) . The Clinical Research Ethics Board of the University 371 of Columbia ( Vancouver , Canada ) granted the permission for post - mortem spinal cord 372 17 acquisition and for sharing biospecimens . Spinal cord biospecimens were collected from 373 consented participants or their next - of - kin and provided as paraffin - embedded tissue 374 sections . 375 Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 detail clinical and neuropathological data of subjects 376 included in this study . 377 378 Zebrafish husbandry and transgenic lines 379 All zebrafish lines were kept and raised under a 14 / 10 h light - dark cycle as described ( 46 ) 380 according to FELASA recommendations ( 47 ) . We used AB and WIK wild - type strains of 381 zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) and the following transgenic zebrafish lines : BAC ( pdgfrb : Gal4ff ) ncv24 382 ( 48 ) , UAS : EGFP zf82 ( 49 ) , UAS - E1b : Eco . NfsB - mCherry c264 ( 50 ) , pdgfrb : TetA AmCyan mps7 383 ( 12 ) , Xla . Tubb : TetA AmCyan ue103 ( 13 ) , and TetRE : lum - mCherry mps3 ( 12 ) . elavl3 : GFP - F mps10 , 384 TetRE : aspn - mCherry mps11 , TetRE : chad - mCherry mps12 , TetRE : fmoda - mCherry mps13 , and 385 TetRE : prelp - mCherry mps14 transgenic zebrafish lines were established using the DNA 386 constructs and methodology described below . 387 Combinations of different transgenic zebrafish lines used in this study were abbreviated 388 as follows : 389 pdgfrb : aspn ( pdgfrb : TetA AmCyan ; TetRE : aspn - mCherry ) , 390 pdgfrb : chad ( pdgfrb : TetA AmCyan ; TetRE : chad - mCherry ) , 391 pdgfrb : fmoda ( pdgfrb : TetA AmCyan ; TetRE : fmoda - mCherry ) , 392 pdgfrb : lum ( pdgfrb : TetA AmCyan ; TetRE : lum - mCherry ) , 393 pdgfrb : prelp ( pdgfrb : TetA AmCyan ; TetRE : prelp - mCherry ) , 394 Xla . Tubb : aspn ( Xla . Tubb : TetA AmCyan ; TetRE : aspn - mCherry ) , 395 Xla . Tubb : chad ( Xla . Tubb : TetA AmCyan ; TetRE : chad - mCherry ) , 396 Xla . Tubb : fmoda ( Xla . Tubb : TetA AmCyan ; TetRE : fmoda - mCherry ) , 397 Xla . Tubb : lum ( Xla . Tubb : TetA AmCyan ; TetRE : lum - mCherry ) , 398 Xla . Tubb : prelp ( Xla .

NfsB - mCherry ) . 401 For live microscopy , embryos were treated with 0 . 00375 % 1 - phenyl - 2 - thiourea ( PTU , 402 Sigma - Aldrich Cat # P7629 ) , beginning at 24 hpf ( hours post - fertilization ) , to prevent 403 pigmentation . 404 All animal experimental procedures were in accordance with institutional and 405 internationally recognized guidelines and were approved by the Regierung von 406 Unterfranken ( Government of Lower Franconia , Würzburg , Germany ) to comply with 407 German animal protection law . The reference number of the animal experimental permit is 408 RUF 55 . 2 . 2 - 2532 . 2 - 1120 - 15 . 409 410 Generation of transgenic zebrafish lines 411 All primer sequences for molecular cloning are given in Supplementary Data S1 . To create 412 the donor plasmid for elavl3 : GFP - F transgenic zebrafish , the sequence coding for the 413 membrane - localized GFP ( EGFP fused to farnesylation signal from c - HA - Ras ) was 414 amplified from the pEGFP - F vector ( Clonetech ) using primer pair # 1 , and cloned 415 downstream of the zebrafish elavl3 promoter ( Addgene plasmid Cat # 59530 ) ( 51 ) . To create 416 the donor plasmids for generation of TetRE : aspn - mCherry , TetRE : chad - mCherry , 417 TetRE : fmoda - mCherry , and TetRE : prelp - mCherry transgenic fish , the sequences coding for 418 zebrafish aspn ( ENSDART00000064798 . 6 ) , chad ( ENSDART00000066264 . 4 ) , fmoda 419 ( ENSDART00000065985 . 5 ) , and prelp ( ENSDART00000155521 . 2 ) were amplified from 420 cDNA of developing zebrafish ( primer pairs # 2 - 5 ) , fused to mCherry at the C - terminus and 421 cloned downstream of the tetracycline operator sequence as described ( 52 , 53 ) . Generation 422 of elavl3 : GFP - F , TetRE : aspn - mCherry , TetRE : chad - mCherry , TetRE : fmoda - mCherry , and 423 TetRE : prelp - mCherry transgenic zebrafish lines was achieved by injection of 35 pg of the 424 respective donor plasmid together with in vitro synthesized capped sense mRNA of the Tol2 425 transposase into 1 - cell embryos ( 54 ) . 426 19 Drug treatments 427 Drug treatments were performed according to the schematic timelines shown with each 428 experiment . Doxycycline ( DOX ; Sigma - Aldrich Cat # D9891 ) was dissolved in reverse 429 osmosis H 2 O at 50 mg / mL and used at a final concentration of 25 µg / mL . Metronidazole 430 ( MTZ ; Sigma - Aldrich # M3761 ) was dissolved in DMSO at 800 mM stock concentration and 431 used at a final concentration of 2 mM . 432 433 Zebrafish spinal cord lesions and behavioral recovery 434 A detailed protocol for inducing spinal cord lesions in zebrafish larvae has been previously 435 described ( 55 ) . Briefly , zebrafish larvae ( 3 dpf ) were anesthetized in E3 medium containing 436 0 . 02 % MS - 222 . A 30 G x ½” hypodermic needle was used to transect the spinal cord by 437 either incision or perforation at the level of the urogenital pore . After surgery , larvae were 438 returned to E3 medium for recovery and kept at 28 . 5°C . Larvae that had undergone 439 extensive damage to the notochord were excluded from further analysis . For lesions , the 440 experimenter was blinded to the experimental treatment . Larvae used for lesions were 441 randomly taken from Petri dishes containing up to 50 animals , however , no formal 442 randomization method was used . 443 Analysis of behavioral recovery after spinal cord transection in larval zebrafish was 444 performed as previously described ( 17 ) , using EthoVision XT software ( Noldus ) . Behavioral 445 data are shown as the distance traveled within 10 s after touch , averaged for triplicate 446 measures per larvae . 447 448 Image acquisition and processing 449 Images were acquired using the systems described in each subsection . Images were 450 processed using ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) , Adobe Photoshop CC , and Zeiss ZEN 451 blue software . Figures were assembled using Adobe Photoshop CC . 452 20 Live imaging of larval zebrafish 453 For live confocal imaging , zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in E3 medium containing 454 0 . 02 % MS - 222 and mounted in the appropriate orientation in 1 % low melting point agarose 455 ( Ultra - Pure TM Low Melting Point , Invitrogen Cat # 16520 ) between two microscope cover 456 glasses . During imaging , larvae were covered with 0 . 01 % MS - 222 - containing E3 medium 457 to keep preparations from drying out . Imaging was done using a Plan - Apochromat 10x / 0 . 45 458 M27 objective , Plan - Apochromat 20x / 0 . 8 objective , and C - Apochromat 40x / 1 . 2 W Korr UV - 459 VIS - IR objective on a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal microscope . 460 461 Sectioning of larval zebrafish 462 Terminally anesthetized zebrafish larvae were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ; Thermo 463 Fisher Scientific Cat # 28908 ) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature . After two washes in PBT 464 ( 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 in PBS ) , larvae were embedded in 4 % agarose in PBS and 50 - 100 µm 465 sections were obtained using a vibratome ( Leica , VT1200S ) . Sections were counterstained 466 with DAPI ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat # 62248 ) to visualize nuclei and mounted in 75 % 467 glycerol . Images were acquired using a Plan - Apochromat 20x / 0 . 8 on a Zeiss LSM 980 468 confocal microscope . 469 470 Tissue dissociation and FACS 471 GFP + and GFP - cells were isolated from pdgfrb : GFP transgenic zebrafish at 4 dpf . 472 120 animals were pooled for each experiment . Before tissue dissociation , head , yolk sac , 473 and tail fin were removed , using micro scissors . Dissociation , live cell staining , and FACS 474 sorting of cells was done as previously described ( 12 ) . Briefly , excised tissue was 475 enzymatically dissociated using 0 . 25 % Trypsin - EDTA ( Gibco Cat # 25200072 ) followed by 476 mechanical dissociation using a fire - polished glass Pasteur pipette . Cell suspension was 477 filtered through a 20 µm cell strainer ( pluriSelect Cat # 43 - 10020 - 40 ) . Following 478 centrifugation for 10 min at 300 g , cells were resuspended in 500 µL HBSS medium ( Gibco 479 21 Cat # 14065 - 056 ) . To stain for viable cells , Calcein Blue ( Invitrogen Cat # C1429 ) was added 480 to the cell suspension . Cells were directly sorted into lysis buffer using a MoFlo Astrios EQ 481 sorter ( Beckman Coulter ) . For the detection of GFP , a 488 nm excitation laser and a 482 526 / 52 nm bandpass filter were used . Calcein Blue was detected following 405 nm 483 excitation using a 431 / 28 nm bandpass emission filter . 484 485 Quantitative RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) 486 For qRT - PCR on isolated pdgfrb + cells , total RNA was extracted from ~ 70 , 000 FACS - sorted 487 GFP + cells of dissected trunks from unlesioned pdgfrb : GFP transgenic animals at 4 dpf , 488 using Total RNA Purification Plus Micro Kit ( Norgen Biotek Cat # 48500 ) . The total RNA 489 extracted from an equal number of GFP - cells obtained from the same animals served as 490 control . 491 For quantification of transcript levels in the lesion site at 1 dpl , trunk tissue of 75 animals 492 spanning approximately three somites in length and containing the lesion site were isolated 493 using micro scissors . Corresponding trunk tissue of unlesioned age - matched clutch mates 494 served as control . Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen 495 Cat # 15596026 ) . 496 Reverse transcription was performed with Maxima™ H Minus cDNA Synthesis Master 497 Mix with dsDNase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat # 1681 ) , using a combination of oligo ( dT ) 498 and random hexamer primers . qRT - PCR was performed at 60°C using PowerUp™ SYBR™ 499 Green Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems Cat # A25918 ) on a StepOnePlus™ Real - Time PCR 500 system . Samples were run in triplicates , and expression levels were normalized to actb1 501 control . Normalized relative mRNA levels were determined using the ∆∆ Ct method . 502 Primers were designed to span an exon – exon junction using Primer - BLAST software 503 ( https : / / ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / tools / primer - blast / ) . All primer sequences are given in 504 Supplementary Data S1 . 505 22 Sample preparation for mass spectrometry ( MS ) analysis 506 For label - free MS - based quantitative proteomics , proteins were isolated from trunk tissue of 507 75 larvae spanning approximately three somites in length and containing the lesion site or 508 corresponding unlesioned age - matched trunk tissue . To identify injury - induced changes in 509 protein abundance , MS analysis was performed on three biological replicates for each 510 condition . To identify changes in protein abundance caused by targeting SLRPs to pdgfrb + 511 cells , MS analysis was performed on four biological replicates for each condition . Isolation 512 of proteins was done as described in ( 56 ) with minor modifications . Proteins were extracted 513 in three distinct fractions , and each fraction was analyzed separately by LC - MS / MS . 514 Zebrafish tissue was homogenized in PBS for 10x 30 s at high intensity , and 10x 30 s 515 pauses in between , using the Bioruptor Plus sonication system ( Diogenode Cat # UCD - 300 ) . 516 After centrifugation at 16 , 000 g for 2 min , the supernatant containing the soluble proteins 517 was collected ( fraction 1 ) . The pellet was resuspended in detergent - containing buffer 518 ( 50 mM Tris ( Sigma - Aldrich Cat # T1503 ) , 5 % glycerin ( Roth Cat # 4043 . 2 ) , 500 mM NaCl 519 ( VWR Cat # 27810 . 295 ) , 1 % NP40 ( Fluka Cat # 74385 ) , 2 % SDC ( Sigma - Aldrich 520 Cat # SER0046 ) , 1 % SDS ( Roth Cat # 4360 . 2 ) , 1 % DNAse I ( in House made , 521 ProteinProduction Facility ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 ( Sigma - Aldrich Cat # M9272 ) ) , followed by 522 incubation at 0°C for 20 min and homogenization using the Bioruptor Plus sonication 523 system . After centrifugation at 16 , 000 g for 2 min , the supernatant containing the detergent - 524 soluble proteins ( fraction 2 ) and the detergent - insoluble protein pellet ( fraction 3 ) were 525 collected . Proteins of fraction 1 and fraction 2 were precipitated by incubation with acetone 526 at - 20°C for overnight . The pellets of all three fractions were dissolved in reduction and 527 alkylation buffer ( 6M guanidinium chloride ( Merck Cat # 1 . 04220 . 1000 ) , 100 mM Tris - HCl 528 pH 8 . 5 , 10 mM TCEP ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat # 77720 ) , 50 mM CAA ( Sigma - Aldrich 529 Cat # C0267 ) ) , followed by incubation at 99°C for 15 min and sonication in the Bioruptor Plus 530 sonication system . The proteins were diluted 1 : 3 with Urea - buffer ( 4 . 5 mM Urea ( Sigma - 531 Aldrich Cat # U1250 ) , 10 mM Tris - HCl , 3 % Acetonitrile ( VWR Cat # 83640 . 320 ) , 1 µg of LysC 532 23 ( Wako Cat # 129 - 02541 ) , and incubated at 37°C for 3 h . Thereafter , the digestion mixture 533 was diluted 1 : 3 with 10 % Acetonitrile in MS grade water ( VWR Cat # 83645 . 320 ) , followed 534 by sonication in the Bioruptor Plus sonication system and incubation with 1 µg of LysC and 535 2 µg of Trypsin ( Promega Cat # V511A ) at 37°C for overnight . Acetonitrile was removed using 536 a SpeedVac ( Christ Cat # RVC 2 - 25 together with CT 02 - 50 ) , and peptides were further 537 purified using in - house produced three plug SCX stage tips ( Empore TM Cation Solid Phase 538 Extraktion Disks Cat # 2251 ) . After elution with 60 µL of 5 % ammonia solution ( Roth 539 Cat # 5460 . 1 ) in 80 % acetonitrile , samples were vacuum - dried in the SpeedVac . 540 541 LC - MS / MS acquisition 542 Peptides were solubilized in 6 µL buffer A ( 100 % MS - LC grade water and 0 . 1 % Formic acid 543 ( VWR Cat # 84865 . 180 ) , and a total volume of 3 µL were loaded onto a 30 cm - long column 544 ( 75 µm inner diameter ( Polymicro Cat # TSP075375 ) ; packed in - house with ReproSil - Pur 545 120 C18 - AQ 1 . 9 - micron beads ( Dr . Maisch GmbH Cat # r119 . aq ) ) via the autosampler of the 546 Thermo Scientific Easy - nLC 1200 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 60°C . For the identification 547 of injury - induced changes in protein abundance ( samples : unlesioned 4 dpf , 1 dpl ; 548 unlesioned 5 dpf , 2 dpl ) , eluted peptides were directly sprayed onto the Q Exactive HF 549 Orbitrap LC - MS / MS system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , using the nanoelectrospray 550 interface . As a gradient , the following steps were programmed with increasing addition of 551 buffer B ( 80 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid ) : linear increase from 30 % over 120 min , 552 followed by a linear increase to 60 % over 10 min , followed by a linear increase to 95 % over 553 the next 5 min , and finally buffer B was maintained at 95 % for another 5 min . The mass 554 spectrometer was operated in a data - dependent mode with survey scans from 300 to 555 1750 m / z ( resolution of 60000 at m / z = 200 ) , and up to 15 of the top precursors were 556 selected and fragmented using higher energy collisional dissociation ( HCD with a 557 normalized collision energy of value of 28 ) . The MS2 spectra were recorded at a resolution 558 of 15k ( at m / z = 200 ) . AGC target for MS1 and MS2 scans were set to 3E6 and 1E5 , 559 24 respectively , within a maximum injection time of 100 ms for MS1 and 25 ms for MS2 . 560 Dynamic exclusion was set to 16 ms . For identification of changes in protein abundance 561 caused by overexpression of SLRPs , eluting peptides were directly sprayed onto the 562 timsTOF Pro LC - MS / MS system ( Bruker ) . As gradient , the following steps were 563 programmed with increasing addition of buffer B ( 80 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid ) : linear 564 increase from 5 % to 25 % over 75 min , followed by a linear increase to 35 % over 30 min , 565 followed by a linear increase to 58 % over the next 5 min , followed by a linear increase to 566 95 % over the next 5 min , and finally buffer B was maintained at 95 % for another 5 min . Data 567 acquisition on the timsTOF Pro was performed using timsControl . The mass spectrometer 568 was operated in data - dependent PASEF mode with one survey TIMS - MS and ten PASEF 569 MS / MS scans per acquisition cycle . Analysis was performed in a mass scan range from 570 100 - 1700 m / z and an ion mobility range from 1 / K0 = 0 . 85 Vs cm - 2 to 1 . 30 Vs cm - 2 , using 571 equal ion accumulation and ramp time in the dual TIMS analyzer of 100 ms each at a spectra 572 rate of 9 . 43 Hz . Suitable precursor ions for MS / MS analysis were isolated in a window of 573 2 Th for m / z < 700 and 3 Th for m / z > 700 by rapidly switching the quadrupole position in 574 sync with the elution of precursors from the TIMS device . The collision energy was lowered 575 as a function of ion mobility , starting from 59 eV for 1 / K0 = 1 . 6 Vs cm - 2 to 20 eV for 576 0 . 6 Vs cm - 2 . Collision energies were interpolated linearly between these two 1 / K0 values 577 and kept constant above or below these base points . Singly charged precursor ions were 578 excluded with a polygon filter mask and further m / z and ion mobility information was used 579 for ‘dynamic exclusion’ to avoid re - sequencing of precursors that reached a ‘target value’ of 580 20 , 000 a . u . The ion mobility dimension was calibrated linearly using three ions from the 581 Agilent ESI LC / MS tuning mix ( m / z , 1 / K0 : 622 . 0289 , 0 . 9848 Vs cm - 2 ; 922 . 0097 Vs cm - 2 , 582 1 . 1895 Vs cm - 2 ; 1221 . 9906 Vs cm - 2 , 1 . 3820 Vs cm - 2 ) . 583 25 Computational MS data analysis 584 Raw data were processed using the MaxQuant computational platform ( versions 1 . 6 . 17 . 0 585 and 2 . 0 . 1 . 0 ) ( 57 ) with standard settings applied . Briefly , the peak list was searched against 586 the zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) proteome database ( SwissProt and TrEMBL , 46847 entries ) with 587 an allowed precursor mass deviation of 4 . 5 ppm and an allowed fragment mass deviation 588 of 20 ppm . MaxQuant enables individual peptide mass tolerances by default , which was 589 used in the search . Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as static modification , and 590 methionine oxidation and N - terminal acetylation as variable modifications . Proteins were 591 quantified across samples using the label - free quantification algorithm in MaxQuant , 592 generating label - free quantification ( LFQ ) intensities . The match - between - runs option was 593 enabled . 594 595 Bioinformatic analysis of proteomics data 596 LFQ intensity values were imported to Perseus software ( version 1 . 6 . 14 . 0 ) ( 58 ) . Filters were 597 set to exclude proteins identified by site , matching to the reverse database or 598 contaminants . For identification of injury - induced changes in protein abundance , proteins 599 that did not exhibit valid values for all three replicates of at least one experimental condition 600 ( unlesioned 4 dpf , 1 dpl ; unlesioned 5 dpf , 2 dpl ) were excluded . This was necessary to 601 include proteins undetectable in unlesioned animals but with enrichment after SCI . For 602 identification of changes in protein abundance caused by cell - type specific induction of 603 SLRPs , all proteins that exhibited  1 invalid value in all eight samples were excluded . 604 Proteins exhibiting significantly altered abundance between experimental and control 605 samples were identified by permutation - based analysis ( 59 ) with FDR < 0 . 1 , s 0 = 0 . 1 , and 606 | FC |  1 . 3 . Principal component analysis plots and volcano plots were created using 607 Perseus software . 608 26 Reactome pathway analysis 609 To identify overrepresented biological pathways based on the observed protein abundance 610 ratios , Reactome pathway analysis was performed using g : Profiler ( 60 , 61 ) . Proteins 611 exhibiting significantly increased abundance in lesioned samples as compared to 612 corresponding unlesioned age - matched control samples ( FDR < 0 . 1 , FC  1 . 3 , s 0 = 0 . 1 ) 613 were analyzed . Reactome pathways with an adjusted ( Bonferroni ) P - value  0 . 05 were 614 considered significantly enriched . 615 616 Heatmaps 617 The zebrafish matrisome was obtained from http : / / matrisome . org ( 18 ) and manually 618 updated for missing UniProt identifiers . The updated matrisome list was imported to Perseus 619 software and matched with the MS dataset to add missing UniProt identifiers , gene symbols , 620 as well as further specifications , including division ( core matrisome , matrisome - associated , 621 and putative matrisome proteins ) and protein symbol of mammalian orthologues . The list of 622 matrisome proteins exhibiting significantly altered abundance between lesioned and 623 corresponding unlesioned age - matched control samples ( FDR < 0 . 1 , | FC |  1 . 3 , s 0 = 0 . 1 ) 624 was extracted , and the Z - score was calculated . Heatmaps were created using Perseus 625 software . 626 627 Cross - species comparison of proteomics data 628 For cross - species comparison of proteomics data , a published dataset from adult Sprague - 629 Dawley rats at seven days post - contusion spinal cord injury ( T10 injury level ) and uninjured 630 control T10 spinal cord segments was re - analyzed ( 30 , 62 ) . LFQ intensity values of ECM - 631 enriched 4M guanidine spinal cord tissue extracts 632 ( https : / / data . mendeley . com / datasets / npkwh5vsss / 1 ) were imported to Perseus software . 633 Filters were set to exclude proteins identified by site , matching to the reverse database or 634 contaminants . Additionally , proteins were excluded that did not exhibit valid values for all 635 27 three replicates of at least one experimental condition ( unlesioned , 7 dpl ) . Proteins 636 exhibiting significantly altered abundance between lesioned and unlesioned control samples 637 were identified by permutation - based analysis ( 59 ) with FDR < 0 . 1 , s 0 = 0 . 1 , and | FC |  1 . 3 . 638 A pairwise comparison of the obtained protein lists using Venny 2 . 1 software 639 ( https : / / bioinfogp . cnb . csic . es / tools / venny ) was performed to identify differentially regulated 640 matrisome proteins between rat and zebrafish ( 63 ) . 641 642 In situ hybridization ( ISH ) 643 A detailed protocol for ISH on whole - mount zebrafish larvae with digoxygenin ( DIG ) - labeled 644 antisense probes has been described in ( 55 ) . In brief , terminally anesthetized larvae were 645 fixed in 4 % PFA ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat # 28908 ) in PBS and treated with Proteinase 646 K ( Invitrogen Cat # 25530 - 049 ) followed by re - fixation for 15 min in 4 % PFA in PBS . DIG - 647 labeled antisense probes were hybridized overnight at 65°C . This protocol allows efficient 648 probe penetration in whole - mount preparations of 5 dpf larvae ( 13 ) . Color reaction was 649 performed after incubation with anti - DIG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase 650 ( Sigma - Aldrich Cat # 11093274910 ) using NBT / BCIP substrate ( Roche Cat # 11697471001 ) . 651 Samples were mounted in 75 % glycerol in PBS and imaged in multi - focus mode using a 652 Leica M205 FCA stereo microscope equipped with a Leica DMC6200 C color camera . 653 Information on ISH probes , including primer sequences used for molecular cloning , is 654 provided in Supplementary Data S1 . All ISH probes showed specific staining in 655 developmental domains . 656 657 Immunofluorescence ( IF ) 658 A detailed protocol for IF on whole - mount zebrafish larvae has been previously described 659 ( 55 ) . Briefly , terminally anesthetized larvae were fixed in 4 % PFA ( Thermo Fisher Scientific 660 Cat # 28908 ) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature . After removing the head and tail using 661 micro scissors , larvae were permeabilized by subsequent incubation in acetone and 662 28 Proteinase K ( Invitrogen Cat # 25530 - 049 ) . Samples were re - fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS , 663 blocked in PBS containing 1 % Triton X - 100 ( PBTx ) and 4 % bovine serum albumin , and 664 incubated over two to three nights with the primary antibody of interest . After several washes 665 in PBTx , samples were incubated over two nights with the secondary antibody of interest . 666 Thereafter , samples were washed in PBTx and mounted in 75 % glycerol in PBS . Imaging 667 was performed using a Plan - Apochromat 20x / 0 . 8 objective on a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal 668 microscope . 669 For neurite outgrowth assay , dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neuron cultures were fixed in 670 4 % PFA ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat # 28908 ) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature . After 671 permeabilization with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 20 min at 37°C , DRG neurons were 672 blocked with 5 % goat serum ( Sigma - Aldrich Cat # G9023 ) in PBS for 45 min at 37°C . 673 Neurites were labeled by subsequent incubation with anti - Tubulin  3 antibody in PBS for 674 2 h and fluorophore - conjugated secondary antibody in PBS for 1 . 5 h at 37°C . DRG neurons 675 were mounted in Fluoromount - G with DAPI ( Invitrogen Cat # E132139 ) and imaged using a 676 Plan - Apochromat 20x / 0 . 8 objective and digital camera system on a Zeiss LSM 980 677 microscope . 678 IF on human paraffin - embedded tissue sections was performed as previously described 679 ( 64 ) . Imaging was performed using Plan - Apochromat 10x / 0 . 45 M27 and Plan - Apochromat 680 20x / 0 . 8 objectives on a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal microscope . 681 We used rabbit polyclonal anti - Collagen IV ( Abcam Cat # ab6586 ) , mouse monoclonal 682 anti - Tubulin  3 ( TUBB3 , Biolegend Cat # 801201 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - Mpx ( GeneTex 683 Cat # GTX128379 ) , mouse monoclonal anti - GFAP ( clone GA5 , Cell Signaling Technology 684 Cat # mAB3670 ) , recombinant rabbit polyclonal anti - GFAP ( clone RM1003 , Abcam 685 Cat # ab278054 ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - LUM ( Invitrogen Cat # MA5 - 29402 ) , sheep 686 polyclonal anti - PRELP ( R & D Systems Cat # AF6447 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - CHAD 687 ( Invitrogen Cat # PA - 553761 ) , mouse monoclonal anti - CHAD ( clone 8B7 , Thermo Fisher 688 Scientific Cat # H00001101 - M01 ) , and mouse monoclonal anti - FMOD ( clone 549302 , R & D 689 29 Systems Cat # MAB5945 ) primary antibodies . Secondary fluorophore - conjugated antibodies 690 were from Invitrogen . 691 692 Whole - mount TUNEL / anti - GFP co - labeling 693 Terminally anesthetized larvae were fixed in 4 % PFA ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat # 28908 ) 694 in PBS for overnight at 4°C . After removing the head and tail using micro scissors , larvae 695 were permeabilized by subsequent incubation in acetone and Proteinase K ( Invitrogen 696 Cat # 25530 - 049 ) as described for whole - mount IF . Samples were re - fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS 697 and Click - iT TUNEL Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Assay ( Thermo Fisher Cat # C10247 ) was 698 performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol to label apoptotic cells . Briefly , samples 699 were equilibrated in TdT reaction buffer for 30 min at room temperature , followed by 700 incubation in TdT reaction cocktail for overnight at room temperature . The click - it reaction 701 was performed for 60 min at room temperature . Thereafter , samples were blocked in PBTx 702 ( 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ) containing 3 % bovine serum albumin and incubated over three 703 nights with chicken anti - GFP antibody ( Abcam Cat # ab13790 ) . After several washes in 704 PBTx , samples were incubated over two to three nights with the secondary antibody of 705 interest . Thereafter , samples were washed in PBTx and mounted in 75 % glycerol in PBS . 706 Imaging was done using a Plan - Apochromat 10x / 0 . 45 M27 objective on a Zeiss LSM 980 707 confocal microscope . 708 709 Primary dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) culture / neurite outgrowth assay 710 Handling of mice was performed in accordance with animal welfare laws , complied with 711 ethical guidelines , and was approved by the responsible local committees and government 712 bodies ( University of Erlangen , Amt für Veterinärwesen der Stadt Erlangen , and the 713 Regierung von Unterfranken ) . Adult ( 4 - 6 months old ) C57BL / 6J mice were killed by cervical 714 dislocation , and spinal cords were removed . DRG neurons were dissected from the spinal 715 cord , incubated in Neurobasal medium ( NB , Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat # 21103049 ) 716 30 containing 2 . 5 mg / mL collagenase P ( Sigma - Aldrich Cat # 11213857001 ) and maintained in 717 an incubator for 1 h at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . The DRG tissue was homogenized by pipetting 718 using finely fired - polished drawn glass pipettes . Dissociated DRG neurons were separated 719 from axon stumps and myelin debris via a 14 % bovine serum albumin layer ( Sigma - Aldrich 720 Cat # A9205 ) and centrifugation at 120 rpm for 8 min . The pellet with DRG neurons was 721 resuspended in NB containing 20 μ L / mL B27 supplement 50x ( Gibco Cat # 17504044 ) , 2 mM 722 Glutamax ( ThermoFisher Cat # 35050 - 061 ) , 10 μ M / mL antibiotic - antimycotic ( Gibco 723 Cat # 15240062 ) , and 0 . 01 μ g / mL nerve growth factor ( ThermoFisher Cat # 3257 - 019 ) . 724 Isolated DRG neurons were seeded on glass coverslips coated with 0 . 1 mg / mL Poly - D - 725 lysine ( PDL , Gibco Cat # A3890401 ) , followed by coating with either 10 µg / mL Laminin 726 ( ThermoFisher Cat # 23017015 ) , a mix of 10 µg / mL Laminin and 5 µg / mL of each SLRP 727 protein ( recombinant human CHAD ( R & D Systems Cat # 8218 - CH ) , FMOD ( R & D Systems 728 Cat # 9840 - FM ) , LUM ( Abcam Cat # ab221400 ) , and PRELP ( R & D Systems Cat # 6447 - PR ) ) , 729 or a mix of 10 µg / mL Laminin and 5 µg / mL CSPGs ( Sigma - Aldrich Cat # CC117 ) . All 730 recombinant SLRP proteins used were produced in mammalian expression systems . DRG 731 cultures were incubated for 48 h at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 to allow neurite outgrowth . 732 733 Cross - polarized optical coherence tomography ( CP - OCT ) 734 For in vivo CP - OCT ( 37 ) , 1 dpl zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in E3 medium containing 735 0 . 015 % MS - 222 and mounted in a lateral position in 1 % low gelling temperature agarose 736 ( Sigma - Aldrich Cat # A0701 ) between two microscope cover glasses . During imaging , larvae 737 were covered with 0 . 01 % MS - 222 - containing E3 medium to keep preparations from drying 738 out . Cross - polarized images of the spinal lesion site were acquired using a custom - built CP - 739 OCT system ( 65 ) . Light from a broadband supercontinuum laser ( YSL Photonics Cat # SC - 740 OEM ) was filtered to acquire a spectrum centered at 885 nm with a full width at half 741 maximum of 80 nm . The laser was operated at 200 MHz . The filtered spectrum from the 742 laser was coupled to a single - mode optical fiber and collimated using a collimator ( Thorlabs 743 31 Cat # F230APC - 850 ) . The light was further split using a 90 / 10 beam splitter ( Thorlabs 744 Cat # BS025 ) into a reference beam and a sample beam . The sample was illuminated with 745 15 mW of optical power . A combination of a quarter - wave plate ( Thorlabs Cat # SAQWP05M - 746 1700 ) and a lens ( Thorlabs Cat # AC254 - 030 - AB ) was inserted in the reference and the 747 sample arm to control the polarization of the light . A galvano mirror ( Thorlabs Cat # GVS012 ) 748 was used to scan the laser beam over the sample . The reflected reference and the sample 749 signals were acquired using a custom - designed spectrometer consisting of a reflective 750 collimator ( Thorlabs Cat # RC08APC ) , a holographic grating ( Wasatch Photonics Cat # 1200 751 l / mm @ 840nm ) , a lens ( Thorlabs Cat # AC - 254 - 080 - B ) , and a line scan camera ( Basler 752 Cat # 2048 pixels , ral2048 - 48gm ) operating at 25 kHz line scan rate . The spectrometer signal 753 was processed using LabVIEW - based custom - designed software ( National Instruments ) . 754 The acquired interference spectrum from the camera was spectrally recalibrated from 755 wavelength space to wavenumber space ( 66 ) and a fast Fourier transform was performed 756 to obtain an axial profile of the sample . 757 758 Combined confocal fluorescence and Brillouin microscopy ( BM ) 759 For in vivo BM , 1 dpl zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in E3 medium containing 0 . 015 % 760 MS - 222 and mounted in a lateral position in 1 % low gelling temperature agarose on a 35 mm 761 glass - bottom dish ( ibidi Cat # 81158 ) . During imaging , larvae were covered with 0 . 015 % MS - 762 222 - containing E3 medium to keep preparations from drying out . Brillouin frequency shift 763 images were acquired by BM employing a confocal configuration and a Brillouin 764 spectrometer consisting of a two - stage virtually imaged phase array ( VIPA ) etalon , as 765 previously described in detail elsewhere ( 43 ) . Briefly , the sample was illuminated by a 766 frequency - modulated diode laser beam (  = 780 . 24 nm , DLC TA PRO 780 , Toptica ) , which 767 was stabilized to the D 2 transition of rubidium 85 Rb . A Fabry - Perot interferometer in two - 768 pass configuration and a monochromatic grating ( Toptica ) were employed to suppress 769 further the contribution of amplified spontaneous emission to the laser spectrum . The laser 770 32 light was coupled into a single - mode fiber and guided into the backside port of a commercial 771 inverted microscope stand ( Axio Observer 7 , Zeiss ) . An objective lens ( 20x , NA = 0 . 5 , EC 772 Plan - Neofluar , Zeiss ) illuminated the sample on a motorized stage with an optical focus . 773 The laser power at the sample plane was set at 15 mW . The backscattered light from the 774 sample was collected by the same objective lens , coupled into the second single - mode fiber 775 to achieve confocality , and delivered to a Brillouin spectrometer . In the Brillouin 776 spectrometer , the backscattered light was collimated and passed through a molecular 777 absorption cell filled with rubidium 85 Rb ( Precision Glassblowing Cat # TG - ABRB - I85 - Q ) , in 778 which the intensity of the Rayleigh scattered and reflected light were significantly 779 suppressed . After passing through the molecular absorption cell , the beam was guided to 780 two VIPA etalons ( Light Machinery Cat # OP - 6721 - 6743 - 4 ) with the free spectral range of 781 15 . 2 GHz , which convert the frequency shift of the light into the angular dispersion in the 782 Brillouin spectrum . The Brillouin spectrum was acquired by a sCMOS camera ( Teledyne 783 Cat # Prime BSI ) , with the exposure time of 0 . 5 s per measurement point . The two - 784 dimensional Brillouin frequency map of the injured region was measured by scanning the 785 motorized stage on the microscope stand , with the translational step size of 0 . 5 µm . The 786 Brillouin microscope was controlled with custom acquisition software written in C + + 787 ( https : / / github . com / BrillouinMicroscopy / BrillouinAcquisition ) . Confocal fluorescence 788 imaging was performed in the same region of interest ( ROI ) as Brillouin measurement using 789 a re - scan confocal microscopy ( RCM ) module ( RCM2 , Confocal . nl ) that was attached to 790 one side port of the microscope stand . The RCM module consists of a sCMOS camera 791 ( Prime BSI Express , Teledyne ) and the multi - line laser unit ( Skyra , Cobolt ) as an excitation 792 illumination source for four laser lines (  = 405 nm , 488 nm , 562 nm , and 637 nm ) . A pinhole 793 of the diameter of 50 µm and the re - scanning imaging principle ( 67 ) provides rapid confocal 794 fluorescence imaging with a lateral resolution of 120 nm . By focusing a confocal 795 fluorescence image in the center of the spinal cord of elavl3 : GFP - F transgenic zebrafish 796 larvae , the axial plane of Brillouin imaging was determined . 797 33 Optical diffraction tomography ( ODT ) 798 For in vivo ODT , 1 dpl zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in E3 medium containing 0 . 015 % 799 MS - 222 and mounted in a lateral position in 1 % low gelling temperature agarose on a 35 mm 800 glass - bottom dish ( ibidi Cat # 81158 ) . During imaging , larvae were covered with E3 medium 801 containing 0 . 015 % MS - 222 and 20 % of refractive index ( RI ) - matching agent Iodaxanol 802 ( OptiPrep TM ; Sigma - Aldrich Cat # D1556 ) ( 68 ) . Iodaxanol was used to reduce the RI 803 difference between the zebrafish larvae and the surrounding medium . The final RI of the 804 medium was 1 . 351 , which was determined by an ABBE refractometer ( Kern & Sohn GmbH 805 Cat # ORT1RS ) . The RI distribution of the zebrafish spinal lesion site was measured by ODT 806 employing Mach - Zehnder interferometry to measure multiple complex optical fields from 807 various incident angles , as previously described ( 69 ) . A solid - state laser beam ( λ = 532 nm , 808 50 mW , CNI Optoelectronics Technology Co . ) was split into two paths using a beamsplitter . 809 One beam was used as a reference beam and the other beam illuminated the sample on 810 the stage of an inverted microscope ( Axio Observer 7 , Carl Zeiss AG ) through a tube lens 811 ( f = 175 mm ) and a water - dipping objective lens ( 40x , NA = 1 . 0 , Carl Zeiss AG ) . A high 812 numerical aperture objective lens ( 40x , water immersion , NA = 1 . 2 , Carl Zeiss AG ) collected 813 the beam diffracted by the sample . To reconstruct a 3D RI tomogram of the sample , the 814 sample was illuminated from 150 different incident angles scanned by a dual - axis galvano 815 mirror ( Thorlabs Cat # GVS212 / M ) located at the conjugate plane of the sample . The 816 diffracted beam interfered with the reference beam at an image plane and generated a 817 spatially modulated hologram , which was recorded with a CMOS camera ( XIMEA 818 Cat # MQ042MG - CM - TG ) . The field - of - view of the camera covers 205 . 0 μ m × 205 . 0 μ m . The 819 complex optical fields of light scattered by the samples were retrieved from the recorded 820 holograms by applying a Fourier transform - based field retrieval algorithm ( 70 ) . The 3D RI 821 distribution of the samples was reconstructed from the retrieved complex optical fields via 822 the Fourier diffraction theorem , employing the first - order Rytov approximation ( 71 , 72 ) . A 823 more detailed description of tomogram reconstruction can be found elsewhere ( 73 ) . The 824 34 MATLAB script for ODT reconstruction can be found at 825 https : / / github . com / OpticalDiffractionTomography / ODT _ Reconstruction . 826 827 Quantifications and statistics 828 Unless otherwise indicated , controls refer to DOX - treated clutch mates of wild type , single 829 transgenic Tet - activator or single transgenic Tet - responder genotype . 830 For quantification of axonal bridge thickness , transgenic live animals ( elavl3 : GFP - F ) were 831 imaged using a Plan - Apochromat 20x / 0 . 8 objective on a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal 832 microscope . The length of a vertical line that covers the width of the axonal bridge at the 833 center of the lesion site , was then determined using ImageJ software 834 ( https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / index . html ) . Measurements of axonal bridge thickness were 835 performed in samples of three independent experiments . Spinal cord lesions for one out of 836 the three experimental replicates were induced by a second operator . 837 Quantification of fluorescence signal in the lesion site was performed on captured images 838 of whole - mount samples using ImageJ software , following previously published protocols 839 ( 13 , 20 ) . Confocal image stacks were collapsed before analysis . For the quantification of 840 area coverage of pdgfrb : GFP + in the lesion site , collapsed confocal stacks were converted 841 to a binary image using the automated mean of grey levels thresholding function of ImageJ 842 software . A pre - set ROI of constant size was applied to all images of the same experiment 843 and the number of pixels determined ( pixel area ) . The ROI was placed in the center of the 844 lesion site and ventrally limited by the notochord . 845 Quantification of pdgfrb : GFP + / TUNEL + cells was performed in a pre - set ROI of constant 846 size on optical sections of a confocal stack using ImageJ software . The ROI was ventrally 847 limited by the dorsal / caudal artery . pdgfrb : GFP + / TUNEL + cells in the floor plate or median 848 fin fold were excluded from analysis based on their location and morphology . Quantification 849 of Mpx + cells in the lesion site was performed in a pre - set ROI of constant size on optical 850 35 sections of a confocal stack using ImageJ software . The ROI was ventrally limited by the 851 notochord . 852 The neurite length of adult murine DRG neurons was quantified using the semi - 853 automated SNT Fiji - ImageJ plugin ( 74 ) . The longest neurite of each DRG neuron was 854 identified and measured . 855 Extraction and quantification of Brillouin frequency shifts were performed in a pre - set 856 ROI , using custom software written in Python ( https : / / github . com / GuckLab / impose ; 857 https : / / github . com / BrillouinMicroscopy / BMicro ) . The ROI was 40 µm x 20 µm , which 858 corresponds to the determined average axonal bridge thickness and the average distance 859 between the spinal cord stumps following a dorsal incision lesion at 1 dpl . The ROI was 860 placed in the center of the lesion site and ventrally limited 5 µm dorsal to the notochord . The 861 ROI was applied to all images . Brillouin frequency shifts were measured in samples of at 862 least three independent experiments . The measured Brillouin frequency shift 𝜈 (cid:3003) can be 863 expressed in terms of the longitudinal modulus 𝑀′ , refractive index ( RI ) 𝑛 , and density 𝜌 of 864 the specimen , as well as the incident wavelength 𝜆 (cid:2868) and scattering angle 𝜗 given by the 865 setup : 𝜈 (cid:2886) (cid:3404) (cid:2870) (cid:3041) √(cid:3014)(cid:4593) (cid:3090) (cid:3116) (cid:3493)(cid:3096) sin (cid:3107) (cid:2870) . All measurements were performed in the backscattering 866 configuration with 𝜗 (cid:3404) 180° and , accordingly sin (cid:3107) (cid:2870) (cid:3404) 1 . The longitudinal compressibility 𝜅 (cid:3013) 867 may be expressed as the inverse of the longitudinal modulus 𝜅 (cid:3013) (cid:3404) (cid:2869) (cid:3014)(cid:4593) . For the sake of 868 conciseness 𝜅 (cid:3013) will be referred to as ‘compressibility’ in the rest of the text , despite the fact 869 that this term is usually defined as the inverse of the bulk modulus K’ . Bulk modulus K’ , 870 shear modulus G ’ , and longitudinal modulus M’ are related by the following equation in the 871 case of an isotropic sample : 𝑀′ (cid:3404) 𝐾′ (cid:3397) (cid:2872) (cid:2871) 𝐺′ . 872 To quantify the co - polarization ratio ( ratio of preserved polarization to total reflectivity ) in 873 the lesion site , two images of the tissue were acquired ; one co - polarized and one cross - 874 polarized image . For the acquisition of the co - polarized image , the angle of the quarter - 875 wave plate ( QWP ) axis in the reference path was set in such a way that the light in the 876 36 sample and the reference arm had the same polarization . To acquire the cross - polarized 877 image , the QWP in the reference beam path was rotated by 45° , resulting in orthogonal 878 polarization between reference and sample arm . Sample reflectivity 𝑅(cid:4666)𝑧(cid:4667) and co - 879 polarization ratio 𝛿(cid:4666)𝑧(cid:4667) of the sample was calculated using the amplitude of the co - ( A co ) and 880 cross - ( A cross ) polarized images using the following equations : 𝑅(cid:4666)𝑧(cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:3493)𝐴 (cid:2913)(cid:2925)(cid:2870) (cid:3397) 𝐴 (cid:2913)(cid:2928)(cid:2925)(cid:2929)(cid:2929)(cid:2870) and 881 𝛿(cid:4666)𝑧(cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:3002) (cid:3278)(cid:3290) (cid:3002) (cid:3161)(cid:3173) (cid:2878)(cid:3002) (cid:3161)(cid:3176)(cid:3173)(cid:3177)(cid:3177) . Using ImageJ software , the co - polarization ratio was determined in a pre - 882 set ROI of constant size for the averaged intensity projection of the complete image stack . 883 The ROI was placed in the center of the lesion site and ventrally limited by the notochord . 884 A second independent observer validated the results . 885 Extraction and quantification of the RI and mass density distribution from reconstructed 886 tomograms were performed using custom - written MATLAB ( MathWorks ) scripts . The mass 887 density of the samples was calculated directly from the reconstructed RI tomograms , since 888 the RI of the samples , 𝑛(cid:4666)𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑧(cid:4667) , is linearly proportional to the mass density of the material , 889 𝜌(cid:4666)𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑧(cid:4667) , as 𝑛(cid:4666)𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑧(cid:4667) (cid:3404) 𝑛 (cid:3040) (cid:3397) 𝛼𝜌(cid:4666)𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑧(cid:4667) , where 𝑛 (cid:3040) is the RI value of the surrounding 890 medium and 𝛼 is the RI increment (cid:4666)𝑑𝑛 / 𝑑𝑐(cid:4667) , with 𝛼 = 0 . 1919 mL / g for proteins and nucleic 891 acids ( 75 , 76 ) . RI and mass density distribution from reconstructed tomograms were 892 evaluated in a pre - set ROI in a sagittal slice of the RI tomogram along the x - y plane at the 893 focused plane , using a custom - written MATLAB ( MathWorks ) script . The ROI was the same 894 as applied to Brillouin and ODT images . Note that the RI was measured in samples 895 independent of those analyzed with BM . 896 Unless indicated , no data were excluded from analyses . Except for determining effect 897 sizes and Gaussian propagation of uncertainty , all statistical analyses were performed using 898 Graph Pad Prism 9 ( GraphPad Software Inc . ) . Mathematica software ( Wolfram Research 899 Inc . ) was used to calculate the Gaussian propagation of uncertainty . All quantitative data 900 were tested for normal distribution using Shapiro - Wilk test . Parametric and non - parametric 901 tests were used as appropriate . All statistical tests used in each experiment are listed in 902 37 Supplementary Data S2 . We used two - tailed Student’s t - test , two - tailed Mann - Whitney test , 903 and paired two - tailed Student’s t - test . Differences were considered statistically significant at 904 P - values below 0 . 05 and effect sizes ( Cohen’s d for Student’s t - test , common language 905 effect size θ for Mann - Whitney test ) including the significance boundary ( 𝑑 (cid:3030) (cid:3404) 1 , 𝜃 (cid:3030) (cid:3404) 0 . 5 ) 906 within their uncertainty . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . The P - value , 907 effect size , and respective uncertainty for each experimental group is given in the figures or 908 Supplementary Data S2 . Respective effect sizes were determined according to ( 77 ) and 909 ( 78 ) using custom scripts in Mathematica software ( Wolfram Research Inc . ) . Unless 910 indicated , variance for all groups data is presented as ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . 911 The sample size ( n ) for each experimental group is given in the figures or Supplementary 912 Data S2 . Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 9 or Mathematica software . 913 38 REFERENCES 1 . S .
