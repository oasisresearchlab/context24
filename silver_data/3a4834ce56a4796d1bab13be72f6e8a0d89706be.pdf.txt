Its loss of function results in cell lysis during growth at elevated temperatures ( e . g . , 39°C ) and impaired signaling to the Mpk1 mitogen - activated protein kinase in response to mild heat shock . We isolated the MID2 gene as a dosage suppressor of the cell lysis defect of an hcs77 null mutant . MID2 encodes a putative membrane protein whose function is required for survival of pheromone treatment . Mid2 possesses properties similar to those of Hcs77 , including a single transmembrane domain and a long region that is rich in seryl and threonyl residues . We demonstrate that Mid2 is required for cell integrity signaling in response to pheromone . Additionally , we show that Mid2 and Hcs77 serve a redundant but essential function as cell surface sensors for cell integrity signaling during vegetative growth . Both proteins are uniformly distributed through the plasma membrane and are highly O - mannosylated on their extracellular domains . Finally , we identiﬁed a yeast homolog of MID2 , designated MTL1 , which provides a partially redundant function with MID2 for cell integrity signaling during vegetative growth at elevated temperature but not for survival of pheromone treatment . We conclude that Hcs77 is dedicated to signaling cell wall stress during vegetative growth and that Mid2 participates in this signaling , but its primary role is in signaling wall stress during pheromone - induced morphogenesis . The cell wall of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required to maintain cell shape and integrity ( 3 , 20 ) . The cell must remodel this rigid structure during vegetative growth and during pheromone - induced morphogenesis . Wall remodeling is monitored and regulated by the cell integrity signaling path - way controlled by the Rho1 GTPase . Two essential functions have been identiﬁed for Rho1 . First , it serves as an integral regulatory subunit of the 1 , 3 - b - glucan synthase ( GS ) complex that stimulates GS activity in a GTP - dependent manner ( 7 , 32 ) . A pair of closely related genes , FKS1 and FKS2 , encode alternative catalytic subunits of the GS complex ( 6 , 13 , 28 , 33 ) that are the presumed targets of Rho1 activity . A second essential function of Rho1 is to bind and activate protein kinase C ( 19 , 29 ) , which is encoded by PKC1 ( 26 , 39 ) . Loss of PKC1 function , or of any of the components of the mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase cascade under its control ( 25 ) , results in a cell lysis defect that is attributable to a deﬁciency in cell wall construction ( 23 , 24 , 31 ) . The MAP kinase cascade is a linear pathway comprised of a MEK kinase ( BCK1 [ 4 , 22 ] ) , a pair of redundant MEKs ( MKK1 / 2 [ 14 ] ) , and a MAP kinase ( MPK1 [ 21 ] ) . One of the consequences of sig - naling through the MAP kinase cascade is transcriptional ac - tivation of FKS2 ( 41 ) . Cell integrity signaling is induced in response to several environmental stimuli . First , signaling is activated persistently in response to growth at elevated temperatures ( e . g . , 37 to 39°C [ 18 ] ) , consistent with the ﬁnding that null mutants in many of the pathway components display cell lysis defects only when cultivated at high temperatures . Second , hypo - osmotic shock induces a rapid but transient activation of signaling ( 5 , 18 ) . Finally , treatment with mating pheromone stimulates sig - naling at a time that is coincident with the onset of morpho - genesis ( 1 , 8 ) . Indeed , mutants defective in cell integrity signaling undergo cell lysis during pheromone - induced mor - phogenesis ( 8 ) . The mechanism by which information regarding the state of the cell wall is transmitted to the intracellular signaling appa - ratus remains an open question . Recently , a gene encoding a putative cell surface sensor for the activation of cell integrity signaling was described and variously designated HCS77 ( 9 ) , WSC1 ( 38 ) , and SLG1 ( 16 ) . Loss of function of HCS77 results in a cell lysis defect that is less severe than that observed for other components of the cell integrity signaling pathway ( 9 , 16 , 38 ) , suggesting that its function may be partially redundant . Indeed , several HCS77 homologs ( WSC2 , - 3 , and - 4 , exist in budding yeast . WSC2 and WSC3 have been reported to con - tribute to cell integrity signaling to a lesser degree than HCS77 ( 38 ) . In our hands , mutants in these genes in combination with hcs77 have only a modest effect on the severity of the cell lysis defect . Moreover , residual signaling to the Mpk1 MAP kinase is evident even in an hcs77 wsc2 wsc3 triple mutant ( 38 ) , indi - cating that these signaling components serve a partially redun - dant function with another unidentiﬁed sensor . Here we present evidence that the Mid2 protein is a cell surface sensor for cell integrity signaling , which together with Hcs77 provides an essential function during vegetative growth . Additionally , we demonstrate that Mid2 is required for activation of this signaling pathway in response to pheromone - induced morpho - genesis .

Escherichia coli DH5 a was used for the prop - agation of all plasmids . E . coli cells were cultured in Luria broth medium ( 1 % Bacto Tryptone , 0 . 5 % Bacto Yeast Extract , 1 % NaCl ) and transformed by standard methods ( 27 ) . Isolation of MID2 and MTL1 . S . cerevisiae DL1987 ( hcs77 D ) was transformed with a plasmid library of genomic yeast DNA ( from strain DL2040 ) in centro - meric vector pRS316 ( 35 ) , constructed as described previously ( 22 ) . Transfor - mants were grown at room temperature and replicated onto YEPD at 38°C for 2 days . Plasmids were rescued from colonies arising at the nonpermissive tem - perature . Clone pRM5 . 2 contained an 8 . 4 - kb insert that included three complete open reading frames ( ORFs ) . In this clone , the MID2 gene was ﬂanked by YLR331C and RPS31 . A Bgl II - Bam HI subclone that possesses MID2 and YLR331C was suppression competent . A 3 9 truncation of MID2 ( by Sna BI ) eliminated the suppression activity of this clone . The MTL1 gene was ampliﬁed by PCR from wild - type ( 1783 ) genomic DNA with 1 . 0 kb of 5 9 ﬂanking sequence and 290 bp of 3 9 ﬂanking sequence and then cloned into the 2 m m - based plasmid pRS424 ( 35 ) . The DNA sequence of the complete insert was determined . DNA sequence analysis was performed by the JHU Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility , using oligonucleotides synthesized by the Biochemistry Core Facility . PCRs for the purposes of cloning were carried out with Pfu polymerase ( Stratagene ) ; Taq polymerase ( Perkin - Elmer ) was used for analytical purposes ( see below ) . The sequence of MTL1 from strain 1783 contained 84 additional nucleotides compared with the database sequence from S288C . These residues result in an in - frame insertion of 28 amino acid residues ( nearly all seryl ) at position 265 , which is within the Ser / Thr - rich region of this protein ( see Fig . 5 ) . Genomic deletions of MID2 and MTL1 . For construction of the mid2 D allele , plasmid pRS315 [ mid2 D < URA3 ] ( provided by H . Iida ) was digested with Xho I and Ssp I , and the resultant 1 . 6 - kb fragment was puriﬁed and used to transform yeast strains DL2256 and DL2393 . Transformants of DL2256 were sporulated , and tetrad analysis was carried out on YEPD with or without 10 % sorbitol . Deletion of MID2 was conﬁrmed by PCR in both strains . To delete the genomic copy of MTL1 , a 900 - bp fragment that is immediately 5 9 to the MTL1 coding sequence , ampliﬁed by PCR from genomic 1783 DNA , was ﬁrst inserted into pBluescript [ HIS4 ] ( gift of Susan Michaelis ) . Next , a 610 - bp fragment that includes 320 bp of coding sequence and 290 bp immediately 3 9 to the MTL1 coding sequence was ampliﬁed and inserted into the resultant plasmid on the other end of HIS4 in the same orientation as the 5 9 sequence . This construct , designated p mtl1 D < HIS4 , was digested with Bss HII to liberate a 6 . 4 - kb fragment , which was used to transform yeast strain DL2337 . Deletion of MTL1 was conﬁrmed by PCR . Pheromone - induced killing . To test for sensitivity to killing by a - factor , MAT a strains were grown in synthetic minimal medium containing limiting calcium ( 100 m M CaCl 2 ) ( 12 ) for 24 h , subcultured in the same medium , and grown to an A 600 of 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 ( 5 3 10 6 to 1 3 10 7 cells / ml ) . Cells were then treated with a - factor ( 8 m g / ml ; Sigma ) , and viability was measured over time by plating onto YEPD . Construction of MID2 and HCS77 fusions to green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) and the hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope . Mid2 was tagged at its C terminus with a UV - optimized variant of GFP , GFPuv . In the ﬁrst of two steps , the GFPuv coding sequence ( 711 bp , including the stop codon ) was ampliﬁed by PCR from pGFPuv ( Clontech ) , with three additional guanosyl residues at the 5 9 end . This fragment was blunt - end inserted into the Sma I site of pRS315 ( 35 ) so as to regenerate a single Sma I site immediately 5 9 of the GFPuv sequence . Next , a 1 . 9 - kb fragment including MID2 with 760 bp of 5 9 noncoding sequence ( ampliﬁed from pRM5 . 2 ) but without its stop codon was blunt - end inserted into the Sma I site of pRS315 [ GFPuv ] . This construct ( p MID2 - GFP ) expressed GFPuv fused to the C terminus of Mid2 with an additional glycyl residue at the fusion point . Mid2 and Hcs77 were tagged at their C termini with the 3xHA ( three - repeat HA ) epitope ( 40 ) . In the ﬁrst of two steps , the 3xHA sequence from PKC1 - HA ( 39 ) was ampliﬁed together with 250 bp of 3 9 noncoding sequence from the PKC1 transcriptional terminator and inserted into the Sma I site of YEp352 ( 10 ) so as to regenerate a single Sma I site immediately 5 9 to the epitope sequence . Next , MID2 ( same fragment as above ) and HCS77 sequences ( including 600 bp 5 9 to the translational start site ) were ampliﬁed through the ﬁnal coding base ( exclud - ing the stop codon ) , and blunt - end inserted into the Sma I site of YEp352 [ 3xHA ] . The resultant clones fused the 3xHA epitope , in frame with an additional glycine residue , to the C termini of Mid2 and Hcs77 . Construction of N - glycosylation site mutants . Hcs77 - HA N - glycosylation mu - tants N4Q and N65Q were constructed by site - directed mutagenesis using the PCR overlap extension method ( 11 ) . Pairs of complementary mutagenic primers ( AAATAATGAGACCGCAAAAAACAAGTCTGC and its reverse comple - ment for the N4Q mutation ; CTTTGCCCTTTATCAACATTCAGAATGTTA and its reverse complement for the N65Q mutation ) were used in separate PCRs with primers either 5 9 or 3 9 to the coding sequence to generate overlapping 5 9 and 3 9 regions of HCS77 - HA , using YEp352 [ HCS77 - HA ] as the template . The products of those reactions were combined in a third reaction to amplify the full - length mutated alleles , which were then digested with Sac I and Xba I and inserted into the cognate sites of YEp352 . Construction of the double mutant was done by generating the N65Q mutation in the N4Q mutant . Fluorescence microscopy of Mid2 - GFP . Haploid strain DL2277 expressing Mid2 - GFP from pRS315 was grown in SD medium for 24 h , subcultured in YEPD to an A 600 of 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 , and washed three times with phosphate - buffered saline ( 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 68 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 47 mM KH 2 OPO 4 [ pH 7 . 4 ] ) . The cells were resuspended in Vectashield mounting medium ( Vector Laboratories , Inc . ) with Hoechst 33342 ( 10 m g / ml ) . A Zeiss ﬂuorescence micro - scope ﬁtted with a ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ﬁlter was used to visualize cells . Activation of Mpk1 - HA by temperature shift and pheromone treatment . Strains expressing Mpk1 - HA were tested for thermal activation ( 18 ) or phero - mone - induced activation ( 1 ) of this protein kinase by immunoprecipitation of the fusion protein from cell extracts with monoclonal antibody 12CA5 ( BabCo and Boehringer Mannheim ) , followed by immunocomplex protein kinase assays . Strains were tested for thermal activation of Mpk1 - HA as described previously ( 18 ) . Strains tested for pheromone - induced activation were grown to a density of ca . 10 7 cells / ml at room temperature in SD medium . Cells were harvested and resuspended in prewarmed ( to 37°C ) YEPD containing 100 mM sorbitol . The cultures were incubated at this temperature for 1 . 5 to 2 h until the cells , which bear a temperature - sensitive cdc28 allele , accumulated at the G 1 block as large unbudded cells . At this time ( t 5 0 ) , samples of each culture were removed for preparation of protein extracts ( 50 ml ) , mating pheromone was added to the remaining culture ( 50 nM a - factor ) , and the cultures were incubated at 37°C . Samples ( 50 ml ) were removed at the indicated times following pheromone addition for preparation of extracts . Extracts were prepared and protein con - centrations were determined as described previously ( 1 ) . Immunocomplex pro - tein kinase assays were performed as described elsewhere ( 18 ) . a - Mannosidase treatment . Mid2 - HA and Hcs77 - HA were immunoprecipi - tated from cell extracts as described previously ( 18 ) except that 100 m g of protein was used and the immunoprecipitation buffer contained 1 % Triton X - 100 instead of Nonidet P - 40 . Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the mannosidase assay buffer ( 100 mM sodium acetate [ pH 5 . 0 ] , 2 mM ZnCl 2 ) and resuspended in 15 m l of buffer . a - Mannosidase ( 5 m l of 0 . 1 U / m l ) was added to the immuno - complexes and incubated fo r 3 h at37°C . Controls were mock treated with assay buffer only under the same conditions . Samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) on an 8 % polyacryl - amide gel followed by immunoblotting as described previously ( 18 ) . Protein concentrations of cell extracts that contained detergent were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent ( Pierce ) . Fractionation of Hcs77 - HA and Mid2 - HA . Transformants of yeast strain 1788 expressing either Mid2 - HA or Hcs77 - HA from YEp352 were grown in YEPD to an A 600 of 1 to 1 . 2 . Cells were harvested from 400 ml , washed once with 10 % sorbitol , and resuspended in 6 ml of lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 50 mM KF ) with protease inhibitors ( 20 m g of leu - peptin , 20 m g of benzamidine , 10 m g of pepstatin , and 40 m g of aprotinin per ml plus 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ) . An equal volume of glass beads ( 0 . 3 - mm diameter ) was added to the suspension , and cells were broken by vigorous vortexing for 5 min at 4°C . The beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 13 , 000 3 g . This crude extract was split , and part was treated with Triton X - 100 ( 1 % ) prior to centrifugation at 100 , 000 3 g for 1 h at 4°C . The pellet was resuspended in a volume of lysis buffer equal to that of the superna - tant , and both were analyzed by SDS - PAGE on an 8 % gel . TABLE 1 .

Its most prominent features include a single trans - membrane domain near its C terminus , a long Ser / Thr - rich region ( ca . 145 residues ) , and a potential Cys - zinc ﬁnger near its N terminus . Loss of HCS77 function results in a cell lysis defect during growth at 37 to 39°C ( 9 , 16 , 38 ) , depending on the genetic background ( unpublished results ) . This defect is accompanied by a deﬁciency in the ability to activate the Mpk1 MAP kinase in response to mild thermal stress ( 9 ) . These ﬁndings , together with the localization of Hcs77 to the cell periphery ( 38 ) , support a model in which Hcs77 functions as a sensor for cell integrity signaling ( 9 , 16 , 38 ) . Isolation of MID2 as a dosage suppressor of the hcs77 D defect . In the course of screening a centromeric library con - structed to isolate the gene encoding a mutational suppressor of the hcs77 D growth defect , we isolated a plasmid that con - tains the wild - type MID2 gene . An hcs77 D strain ( DL1987 ) was transformed with a genomic yeast library and screened for suppression of its cell lysis defect at 39°C . We isolated from this screen a single plasmid ( pRM5 . 2 ) which contains a region of chromosome 12 with three complete ORFs . One of these is MID2 ( YLR332W ) ; the others were RPS31 and an uncharac - terized ORF , designated YLR331C . Deletion analysis of this plasmid revealed that MID2 ( for mating - induced death ) was the gene responsible for suppression of hcs77 D ( data not shown ) . A MID2 isolate from wild - type cells was able to sup - press hcs77 D when cloned into a centromeric vector . More - over , DNA sequence analysis of the plasmid - borne MID2 re - vealed no differences from the same region of DNA isolated by PCR from the isogenic wild - type strain , indicating that MID2 acts as a dosage suppressor of the hcs77 D defect , even when expressed from a low - copy - number plasmid . This suppression was more easily observed in an hcs77 D wsc2 D double mutant ( Fig . 1A ) , which has a growth defect slightly more severe than that of the strain with hcs77 D alone ( 38 ) . Because Hcs77 acts through the cell integrity signaling path - way , we examined the ability of MID2 overexpression to sup - press other mutant defects in signaling components thought to be under the control of Hcs77 . Figure 1B shows that overex - pression of MID2 from a multicopy vector suppresses the growth defect of the rho1 - 5 mutant ( DL1235 ) , which lyses at the restrictive temperature ( 19 ) . This suppression was allele speciﬁc , because MID2 failed to suppress the growth defects of rho1 - 3 and rho1 - 4 mutants ( not shown ) , indicating that MID2 overexpression does not bypass the requirement for RHO1 . Strains with mutations in other genes that function down - stream of RHO1 ( e . g . , PKC1 , BCK1 , and MPK1 ) were not detectably suppressed by MID2 overexpression . MID2 and HSC77 act in parallel to regulate cell integrity signaling . Three possibilities exist for the organization of a pathway in which both Hcs77 and Mid2 function . Mid2 might be under the control of Hcs77 such that overexpression of Mid2 drives pathway activation sufﬁciently to allow survival of thermal stress in the absence of signal from Hcs77 . Alterna - tively , these proteins might act in parallel to provide a partially redundant function in the regulation of cell integrity signaling . Finally , Mid2 might positively regulate the expression of the HCS77 - related genes WSC2 , WSC3 , and WSC4 . However , steady - state mRNA levels from these genes were found to be unaffected by either overexpression or deletion of MID2 ( data not shown ) , ruling out this last possibility . To distinguish between the two remaining possibilities , we ﬁrst tested for suppression of the mid2 D defect by HCS77 overexpression . The MID2 gene was isolated initially for its null mutant phenotype , which is failure to survive mating pher - omone treatment ( 30 ) . Treatment of a MATa mid2 D mutant with a - factor resulted in 90 % cell death after 5 h ( Fig . 2 ) . FIG . 1 . Overexpression of MID2 suppresses the cell lysis defect of an hcs77 D wsc2 D mutant and a conditional rho1 mutant . ( A ) Transformants of yeast strain DL2230 ( hcs77 D wsc2 D ) harboring episomal vector ( pRS424 ) , pRS424 [ MID2 ] , or centromeric plasmid pRS316 [ HCS77 ] were streaked onto a YEPD plate and incubated at 38°C for 3 days . ( B ) Transformants of yeast strain DL1235 ( rho1 - 5 ) harboring episomal plasmid pRS424 or pRS424 [ MID2 ] or centromeric plasmid pRS314 [ RHO1 ] or pRS314 [ MID2 ] were streaked onto a YEPD plate and incubated at 37°C for 3 days . FIG . 2 . Overexpression of HCS77 suppresses the pheromone - induced death of a mid2 D mutant . Yeast strain DL2277 ( MAT a mid2 D ) transformed with centromeric vector pRS314 , pRS314 [ MID2 ] , or episomal plasmid pRS424 [ HCS77 ] was grown in SD with limiting calcium ( 100 m M CaCl 2 ) at 30°C to an A 600 of 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 . Mating pheromone ( a - factor ; 8 m g / ml ) was added to the cultures , and samples were tested hourly for viability by plating onto YEPD . Plates were scored after 2 days at room temperature .

The absence of an epistatic relationship , demonstrated by the re - ciprocal suppression of hcs77 D by MID2 and mid2 D by HCS77 , suggests that these genes function in parallel . The possibility that Mid2 and Hcs77 share a redundant func - tion is also supported by structural similarities between these proteins . The Mid2 polypeptide , like Hcs77 , is predicted to be a type 1 membrane protein with its transmembrane region near the C terminus . Additionally , it possesses a long Ser / Thr - rich region ( ca . 185 residues ) that is N terminal to the transmem - brane domain . These features , together with the ability of MID2 to suppress hcs77 D , suggests that these proteins might have overlapping functions , although Hcs77 and Mid2 show no sequence similarity outside these generally related regions . One prediction of a model in which Mid2 and Hcs77 share a function is that the combined defect of mutations in both genes should be more severe than either defect alone . There - fore , we tested the mid2 D and hcs77 D mutations for additivity of growth defects . Either mutation alone did not result in a growth defect at temperatures as high as 37°C ( not shown ) . In contrast , the double mutant was inviable even at room tem - perature ( Fig . 3 ) . This growth defect was suppressed by the addition of 10 % sorbitol to the growth medium for osmotic support at temperatures as high as 34°C . Removal of osmotic support resulted in immediate cell lysis , as judged microscop - ically by a high frequency of nonrefractile ghosts . The behavior of the mid2 D hcs77 D mutant is characteristic of other mutants in the cell integrity signaling pathway . Mid2 and Hcs77 are plasma membrane - associated proteins . Another prediction of a model in which Mid2 and Hcs77 func - tion as sensors for cell integrity signaling is that they should localize to the plasma membrane . Hcs77 has been shown by ﬂuorescence microscopy to be distributed uniformly around the cell periphery ( 38 ) . To examine the intracellular localiza - tion of Mid2 , we ﬁrst fused GFP to the C terminus of Mid2 . This fusion protein was fully functional , as judged by its ability to complement the pheromone sensitivity of the mid2 D mutant when expressed from a centromeric plasmid ( not shown ) . Flu - orescence microscopy of cells expressing the Mid2 - GFP fusion from the same plasmid revealed that this protein localizes uniformly around the cell periphery ( Fig . 4A ) . By contrast , GFP alone , when expressed in yeast , is cytoplasmic ( 38 ) . No ﬂuorescent signal was detected from control cells ( not shown ) . Treatment of cells with mating pheromone for up to 6 h did not appear to alter the localization of Mid2 - GFP ( not shown ) . To examine the intracellular localization of Mid2 and Hcs77 biochemically , we fused the 3xHA epitope to their C termini . These fusions were fully functional , as judged by their ability to complement the defects associated with their deletion muta - tions when expressed from centromeric plasmids ( not shown ) . Mid2 - HA and Hcs77 - HA were overexpressed from multicopy plasmids for the purpose of immunodetection . Both proteins migrated on SDS - PAGE as diffuse bands of much greater apparent molecular mass than those predicted by their amino acid sequences , suggestive of modiﬁcation ( see below ) . Figure 4B and C show that both Mid2 - HA and Hcs77 - HA fraction - ated completely with the pellet from a 100 , 000 3 g centrifu - gation in the absence of detergent . In contrast , both proteins were solubilized in the presence of the nonionic detergent FIG . 3 . A mid2 D hcs77 D mutant displays a severe cell lysis defect .

Taken together with the peripheral localization observed for Hcs77 - GFP and Mid2 - GFP , these results indicate that both proteins are associated with the plasma membrane . This ﬁnding , combined with the strongly additive growth defect of the mid2 D hcs77 D mutant and the reciprocal suppression results described above , indicates that these genes provide an essential but redundant function in the maintenance of cell integrity during vegetative growth . Mid2 has a homolog , Mtl1 . A search of the yeast genome database revealed that MID2 has a homolog on chromosome 7 . This uncharacterized ORF ( YGR023 ) shows 50 % amino acid sequence identity with Mid2 ( Fig . 5 ) . The gene was therefore designated MTL1 ( for MID2 - like ) . We constructed a genomic deletion of MTL1 ( see Materials and Methods ) . An mtl1 D mutant displayed no growth defect at temperatures up to 39°C , nor was it sensitive to pheromone - induced death ( data not shown ) . However , a mid2 D mtl1 D mutant displayed an osmot - ic - remedial lysis defect when grown at 39°C ( Fig . 6A ) , as evi - denced by a high frequency of nonrefractile ghosts in the ab - sence of osmotic support at the restrictive temperature . Overexpression of HCS77 weakly suppressed this growth de - fect ( Fig . 6B ) , further supporting a model in which these genes share a common function during vegetative growth . Loss of MTL1 did not enhance the sensitivity of a mid2 D mutant to pheromone - induced killing , nor did it confer pheromone sen - sitivity to an hcs77 D mutant ( not shown ) . However , overex - pression of MTL1 partially suppressed the pheromone sensi - tivity of mid2 D . In contrast to mid2 D , the mtl1 D mutation did not exacerbate the cell lysis defect of an hcs77 D mutant , nor did overexpression of MTL1 suppress hcs77 D . These results , taken in the aggregate , indicate that MID2 plays a more im - portant role in both vegetative growth and pheromone sensi - tivity than does MTL1 . Mild thermal stress is a condition known to activate the Mpk1 MAP kinase in wild - type cells ( 18 ) . To examine the role of Mid2 and Mtl1 in cell integrity signaling during vegetative growth , we compared the activities of Mpk1 in wild - type and mutant strains in response to shift from growth at room tem - perature to 39°C for 1 h . Mpk1 was strongly activated by this treatment in wild - type cells ( Fig . 6C ; compare lanes 1 and 2 ) . Temperature - induced activation of this protein kinase in an assay with myelin basic protein ( MBP ) as the substrate was somewhat diminished in both a mid2 D mutant and an mtl1 D mutant ( compare lanes 4 and 5 and lanes 6 and 7 , respectively ) . Mpk1 activation was severely impaired in the mid2 D mtl1 D mutant but not completely eliminated ( compare lanes 8 and 9 ) , consistent with the weak cell lysis defect of the double mutant . It should be noted that the double mutant survived this treat - ment for the duration of the experiment ( data not shown ) . An hcs77 D mutant , which is also markedly impaired for Mpk1 activation , also retains some ability to stimulate this kinase . Because an hcs77 D mid2 D mutant is inviable in the absence of osmotic support , and high osmolarity prevents activation of Mpk1 in response to thermal stress ( 18 ) , we were unable to examine Mpk1 activation in this mutant . MID2 is required for cell integrity signaling in response to mating pheromone - induced morphogenesis . Cell integrity sig - naling is activated by pheromone treatment at a time that is coincident with the onset of morphogenesis ( 8 ) . Moreover , like mid2 mutants , mutants that fail to activate cell integrity signal - ing are killed by pheromone treatment ( 8 ) . Therefore , we examined the ability of a mid2 D mutant to activate cell integ - rity signaling in response to treatment with mating pheromone . Cells that are synchronized at Start display a strong activation of the Mpk1 MAP kinase in response to a - factor treatment , which peaks approximately 1 h after exposure to the phero - mone ( 1 , 8 ) ( Fig . 7 ) . An isogenic mid2 D mutant was greatly impaired in this activation . It should be noted that the mid2 D mutant survived pheromone treatment for the duration of this experiment ( not shown ) . Interestingly , the pheromone - in - duced death of the mid2 D mutant was not suppressed by os - motic support ( 1 M sorbitol ) , in contrast to pheromone - in - duced death of an mpk1 D mutant ( 8 ) . This ﬁnding suggests that Mid2 may serve an additional function beyond regulation of cell integrity signaling . Hcs77 and Mid2 are highly glycosylated proteins . Hsc77 - HA is predicted to migrate on SDS - PAGE with a mo - lecular mass of approximately 43 kDa . Instead , it migrated as a diffuse band with apparent molecular mass of 85 to 90 kDa , suggesting that Hcs77 is a highly glycosylated protein ( Fig . 4B ) . This protein possesses two potential N - glycosylation sites ( AsnSer / Thr ) at positions 4 and 65 , as well as many potential O - glycosylation sites in the Ser / Thr - rich region . To examine the glycosylation state of this protein , we ﬁrst eliminated the potential N - glycosylation sites by mutating the acceptor Asn residues to Gln . Figure 8A shows that neither of the single mutants nor the double mutant had an altered mobility , indi - cating that Hcs77 is not N - glycosylated . Additionally , these mutants were fully functional for complementation of an hcs77 D mutant ( not shown ) . The Mid2 - HA protein behaved similarly to Hcs77 - HA , hav - ing a predicted molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa , but migrating on SDS - PAGE with a much greater apparent mo - lecular mass ( 160 to 180 kDa [ Fig . 4C ] ) . To examine these proteins for O - glycosylation , we immunoprecipitated them from cell extracts and subjected the immunocomplexes to a - mannosidase treatment . This treatment hydrolyzes the a - linkages between residues of O - linked mannose chains . a - Mannosidase can also hydrolyze mannosyl residues present at the termini of N - linked GlcNAc chains . Figure 8B shows that mannosidase treatment reduced Mid2 - HA to a species of apparent molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa and re - FIG . 5 . Sequence alignment of Mid2 and Mtl1 .

The observed values are nearly identical to the predicted masses of the unmodiﬁed proteins , conﬁrming that Hcs77 ( and strongly suggesting that Mid2 ) is speciﬁcally O - mannosylated . DISCUSSION MID2 and HCS77 act in parallel to stimulate cell integrity signaling . The HCS77 gene is thought to encode a cell surface sensor that detects cell wall weakness during vegetative growth . We isolated MID2 as a low - copy - number dosage suppressor of the growth defect of an hcs77 D mutant at 39°C . Several addi - tional observations support a model in which Hcs77 and Mid2 are redundant sensors for cell integrity signaling during growth . First , an hcs77 D mid2 D double mutant displayed an osmotic remedial cell lysis defect that was much more severe than that of an hcs77 D mutant , failing to grow at any temper - ature in the absence of osmotic support . Second , although loss of MID2 function alone does not result in a growth defect ( 30 ) , deletion of the MTL1 gene , which encodes a Mid2 - like protein ( see below ) , in a mid2 D mutant resulted in an osmotic remedial cell lysis defect at 39°C that was suppressed by overexpression of HCS77 . Third , the ability to activate cell integrity signaling FIG . 6 . A mid2 D mtl1 D mutant displays an osmotic - remedial cell lysis defect and is deﬁcient in activating the Mpk1 MAP kinase . ( A ) Diploid yeast strains 1788 ( wild type [ WT ] ) , DL2394 , DL2395 , and DL2396 were streaked onto YEPD or YEPD supplemented with 10 % sorbitol and incubated at 39°C for 3 days . ( B ) Transformants of a mid2 D mtl1 D mutant ( DL2396 ) harboring episomal plasmid pRS424 , pRS424 [ HCS77 ] , or centromeric plasmid pRS314 [ MID2 ] were streaked onto a YEPD plate and incubated at 39°C for 3 days . ( C ) The same yeast strains as in panel , A but transformed with YEp351 [ MPK1 - HA ] , were cultured to mid - log phase at 23°C and shifted to 39°C for 1 h . Mpk1 - HA was immunoprecipitated from extracts with monoclonal antibody ( Ab ) 12CA5 , and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to protein kinase assays using MBP as the substrate . The lower panel displays an immunoblot of the Mpk1 - HA immunoprecipitates . FIG . 7 . Mid2 is required for pheromone - induced activation of Mpk1 . Cul - tures of a cdc28 - 13 mid2 D strain ( DL2435 ) and an isogenic MID2 strain ( DL2393 ) , both expressing Mpk1 - HA from episomal plasmid pNC507 ( 1 ) , were arrested in G 1 at 37°C and treated with mating pheromone ( 50 nM a - factor ; t 5 0 ) . Mpk1 - HA was immunoprecipitated from extracts of cultures taken at the indicated time points . Immunocomplex protein kinase assays were conducted with MBP as the substrate . Values represent 32 P - labeled MBP quantiﬁed by phosphorimager at each time point relative to that for the MID2 extract assay at t 5 0 . Each value is the average of two independent experiments . Immunoblots of Mpk1 - HA indicated that the levels of this protein did not change during the course of the experiment ( not shown ) . 3974 RAJAVEL ET AL . M OL . C ELL .

Fourth , the structural similarity be - tween Hcs77 and Mid2 , together with their intracellular colo - calization , also suggests redundancy in function . Speciﬁcally , they are both uniformly distributed through the plasma mem - brane , presumably by virtue of their single membrane - span - ning regions . Additionally , they were both shown to be highly O - mannosylated through long Ser / Thr - rich regions that are predicted to reside extracellularly . Overexpression of either RHO1 or PKC1 suppresses the growth defect of hcs77 D cells ( 9 , 38 ) , suggesting that these components of the cell integrity pathway function downstream of HCS77 . Similarly , we found that overexpression of RHO1 also suppresses a mid2 D mutant . However , overexpression of MID2 was capable of suppressing the growth defect of one rho1 mutant ( rho1 - 5 ) . We interpret this allele - speciﬁc suppression to indicate that MID2 is not capable of bypassing the require - ment for RHO1 ( either by acting downstream of or parallel to this G protein ) but instead suppresses the rho1 - 5 defect by acting upstream of this allele . Therefore , we propose that both Hcs77 and Mid2 contribute to Rho1 activation . MID2 is required for cell integrity signaling in response to mating pheromone treatment . The MID2 gene was isolated initially because its loss of function causes cell death in re - sponse to treatment with mating pheromone ( 30 ) . Mutants in MID2 arrest growth in G 1 and undergo morphogenesis in re - sponse to pheromone but fail to recover from this arrest . Ac - tivation of cell integrity signaling is a late response to phero - mone treatment that , like MID2 , is essential for survival of pheromone - induced morphogenesis ( 8 ) . In addition to the role that Mid2 plays in signaling cell wall stress during vegetative growth , we demonstrated that it is also critical for cell integrity signaling during pheromone - induced morphogenesis . Interest - ingly , in contrast to the behavior of an mpk1 D mutant in re - sponse to pheromone ( 8 ) , the pheromone sensitivity of a mid2 D mutant is not suppressed by the addition of osmotic support to the medium ( to prevent cell lysis ) , suggesting that Mid2 may have an additional function in the survival of pher - omone treatment . Intriguingly , MID2 was also isolated as a dosage suppressor of a strain with a mutation of MPT5 ( 37 ) , which has been proposed to act through the Cdc28 cyclin - dependent kinase to stimulate passage through G 1 in phero - mone - arrested cells ( 2 ) . Therefore , Mid2 may have a cell cycle function that is independent of its role in cell integrity signal - ing . In contrast to Mid2 , Hcs77 appears to be dedicated to signaling cell wall perturbation during vegetative growth and thermal stress , because a null mutant did not display sensitivity to killing by mating pheromone ( 32a ) . Hcs77 and Mid2 as sensors of cell wall stress . The predicted topography of these plasma membrane proteins , based on the positions of their signal sequences , indicates that they have short C - terminal cytoplasmic domains and longer extracellular domains that are very rich in seryl and threonyl residues . These domains are separated by a single transmembrane sequence . The extracellular domains are highly O - mannosylated . In yeast , this modiﬁcation consists of several ( four or ﬁve ) man - nosyl residues in a - 1 , 2 and 1 , 3 linkages ( 36 ) . When many such modiﬁcations are present in a stretch of seryl / threonyl resi - dues , as appears to be the case for both Hcs77 and Mid2 , they induce the polypeptide to adopt a stiff and extended confor - mation ( 17 ) . Therefore , Hcs77 and Mid2 may function as mo - lecular probes that span the periplasmic space to interact di - rectly with the cell wall . If these proteins are glycosylated throughout their Ser / Thr - rich regions , the calculated extents of Mid2 ( ca . 470 Å ) and Hcs77 ( ca . 370 Å ) are adequate to span the distance from the plasma membrane to the cell wall ( ca . 200 to 300 Å ) . Mid2 and Hcs77 are predicted to have overlapping intracel - lular targets . Paradoxically , however , their predicted intracel - lular domains are not similar at the level of primary sequence . They may interact with different complexes that share common signaling components , or they may be linked to the cell integ - rity signaling apparatus through different adaptor molecules . The Mid2 homolog , Mtl1 . We isolated a gene predicted to encode a polypeptide showing 50 % amino acid sequence iden - tity with Mid2 . Loss of MTL1 function did not result in any overt defects , either during vegetative growth or in response to mating pheromone , nor did it exacerbate either the phero - mone sensitivity of a mid2 D mutant or the cell lysis defect of an hcs77 D mutant . However , a mid2 D mtl1 D mutant displayed a weak cell lysis defect when cultivated at high temperature and was more impaired for thermal activation of the Mpk1 MAP kinase than was a mid2 D mutant . Therefore , MTL1 appears to play a minor role in cell integrity signaling during vegetative growth . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank H . Iida , J . Gray , and S . Michaelis for strains and plasmids .
