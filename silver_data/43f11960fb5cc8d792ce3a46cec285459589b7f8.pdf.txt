We present a case study focusing on prototyping a receptionist agent migrating between three platforms ( a monitor on the wall , a mobile phone , and a physical robot ) . More specifically , we compare virtual reality ( VR ) and physical ( real - world ) prototyping methods . The two meth - ods are compared in terms of fidelity and usability . The breadth of features , the degree of functionality , and the interactivity were simi - lar . However , the aesthetic refinement differed . The VR prototyping method also had much higher prerequisites in terms of equipment and skills , and the learning curve for the designer was steep . Both methods were equally efficient in user testing , but the VR method revealed more usability issues in the efficiency category , while the physical space method revealed more issues in the effectiveness category .

It allows for the integration of different engineering disciplines through simulation , enabling comprehen - sive testing and identification of user requirements without the need for physical construction . Additionally , VR prototyping en - ables early visualisation of new designs , effectively demonstrating their capabilities and features . It also facilitates the simulation and evaluation of concepts that may not be currently feasible but are anticipated to be achievable in the future [ 16 ] . In contrast to VR prototyping , physical prototyping involves the construction of tangible , real - world prototypes . While physical prototyping may not offer the same level of flexibility and com - plexity as VR , it allows for a more hands - on approach . It enables designers to assess the physical characteristics and interactions of the agent [ 6 , 10 ] . Additionally , physical prototypes can be beneficial for assessing the feasibility and practicality of implementing certain features or behaviours in real - world settings [ 17 ] . Previous research has covered various prototyping methods [ 3 , 8 , 14 ] , but there is a gap when it comes to prototyping for migrating agent interfaces . Furthermore , limited information is available regarding the similarities and differences between VR and physical prototyping in this context . Therefore , this study aims to address this research gap by comparing the interface prototyping methods for migrating agents , specifically focusing on VR and phys - ical prototypes . The findings of this research will contribute to the understanding of the considerations and implications associated with prototyping migrating agent interfaces and shed light on the similarities and differences between VR and physical prototypes in this domain . In this paper , the VR and physical prototyping methods are compared in the context of a migrating receptionist for a computer science department . The research questions are : RQ1 : How does the fidelity differ between the two prototypes ? RQ2 : How does the usability differ between the two prototyping methods ? A migrating agent is an Intelligent virtual agent ( IVAs ) that mi - grates between different agent embodiments , such as a physical robot to a digital human - like character that appears on a screen . Agents such as receptionists are useful in providing assistance in public spaces . Different embodiments present varied opportu - nities and constraints for interaction . Digital characters exhibit heightened efficacy in conveying emotions , albeit without physical mobility . Handheld device characters offer portability but are re - stricted in size and interaction modalities [ 3 ] . Robots , on the other hand , possess a physical presence , yet encounter mobility issues and power limitations [ 11 , 12 ] . 369 HAI ’23 , December 04 – 07 , 2023 , Gothenburg , Sweden Emma Mainza Chilufya , Mattias Arvola , and Tom Ziemke The receptionist in this case study is based on a cross - platform concept of a previous study [ 1 ] . The receptionist migrates from a screen by the entrance , to a mobile phone used while walking , and then to a robot in the coffee area . PROTOTYPING A MIGRATING RECEPTIONIST This section presents the tools and methods used in prototyping and evaluating the migrating receptionists in VR and the physical space . Fidelity of Prototypes In this study , we design and evaluate two prototypes of a migrating receptionist that are close to the final product in certain aspects but not in others . The migrating receptionist system was designed to be immersive , engaging and seamless , and the system was to have user - friendly interfaces . The user was to feel accompanied by the same agent between embodiments , and the interactions in both environments ( VR and physical space ) were to be as similar as possible . Although low - fidelity and high - fidelity are often used to char - acterise different prototyping approaches , the concept of fidelity often combines multiple independent aspects of the artifact , leading to a conflation of orthogonal dimensions [ 15 ] . Using a Virzi ext al . ’s [ 15 ] four dimensions of prototype characterisation with McCurdy et al . ’s [ 13 ] 5th addition , we define the orthogonal dimensions as follows : • Breadth of Features : This was low for both prototypes as there was a single path interaction in each interface . • Depth of Functionality : The depth of features for both prototypes was high compared to the final product as both methods have the three embodiments implemented and par - ticipants interact with all embodiments . • Level of Interactivity : This was rated low for both pro - totypes as interactions with the receptionist were mostly text - to - speech . • Level of Visual Refinement : As one of the goals was for interactions in both environments to be as similar as possible , it was important to have the VR environment mimic the physical space . This meant high - level aesthetic refinement in the three areas of interaction . • Depth of Data Model : The level of the data model was low for both Prototypes as this was a single path level of interaction . Usability of the Prototyping Methods In this study , we define the usability of the prototyping methods in terms of efficiency , effectiveness , and prerequisites . Efficiency looks at the differences in development , test and analysis time of each method . Effectiveness looks at the kind of issues detected in each method . Prerequisites look at the equipment and the skills required for each method . Details of each area are shown in table 1 . User Testing Process Testing of the prototypes involved 23 participants : 12 members of staff , 6 female and 6 male ( age range : 21 – 59 ) ; and 11 students , 6 Virtual Reality Physical Space Pre - requisites : Skills - 3D modelling and animation . - C + + / Blueprints ( node - based programming ) . - HTML , CSS , and JavaScript . - Kotlin or Graphical programming .

Table 1 : Usability . female and 5 male ( age range : 18 – 49 ) . Each participant first com - pleted a consent form [ 2 ] and then were given a scenario to find a named member of staff . They first interacted with the receptionist at the entrance screen and then the agent on the mobile phone giving real - time directions in the corridor . The agent then asked participants to wait in the coffee area where they interacted agent through a robot . This was followed by the product reaction card session [ 4 , 5 ] , and then the System Usability ( SUS ) questionnaire [ 7 ] . The order in which a participant experienced a prototype was balanced ( in - terchanged ) to reduce learning and order effects . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Using the five dimensions of fidelity , we see that the main contrast between the prototyping methods was the visual refinement which was a combination of low and high for the VR method and high for the physical . User results showed the highest count of easy – to – use reactions for both prototypes . Other reactions with a high count include : effective , engaging and seamless . For negative reactions , the VR prototype results included confusing , overwhelming , and difficult . The physical space prototype results included : complex , intimidat - ing , and inconsistent . The SUS results showed a mean of 83 . 9 for the physical space and 78 . 3 for the virtual space . The usability evaluation of the prototyping methods revealed a notable contrast as shown in table 1 . The prerequisites for both methods involved various components , with a programming back - ground serving as the foundational requirement . The VR methods revealed a steep learning curve for the designer , whilst the physi - cal method specifically employed multiple interaction tools , which 370 A Comparative Study of Physical and Virtual Reality Prototyping of a Migrating Agent Interface HAI ’23 , December 04 – 07 , 2023 , Gothenburg , Sweden required proficiency in Kotlin for Furhat and the web development stack ( HTML , CSS , and JavaScript ) for the static websites , com - pared to the VR method with a single programming platform for all embodiments . The VR prototyping can be used for visual refinement and early concept assessment , while employing physical prototypes for real - world interaction testing and usability . If expertise allows . a hybrid approach for a comprehensive evaluation strategy can be consid - ered . REFERENCES [ 1 ] 3472307 . 3484171 . 2021 .
