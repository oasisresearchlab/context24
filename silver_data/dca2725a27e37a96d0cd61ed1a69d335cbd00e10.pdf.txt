Abstract ( 250 / 250 words ) Objectives . We aimed to report the results of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - based screening campaigns conducted on dependent elderly residents ( compared to staffs members ) in long - term care facilities ( LTCFs ) in Marseille , France , and the follow - up of positive cases . Methods . Data from 1 , 691 elderly residents and 1 , 000 members of staff were retrospectively collected through interviewing the medical teams in 24 LTCFs and using the hospitals’ electronic health recording systems . Results . Elderly residents were predominantly female ( 64 . 8 % ) with a mean age of 83 . 0 years . SARS - CoV - 2 detection among residents ( 226 , 13 . 4 % ) was significantly higher than among staff members ( 87 , 8 . 7 % ) , with p < 0 . 001 . Of the 226 infected residents , 37 ( 16 . 4 % ) were detected on a case - by - case basis due to their COVID - 19 symptoms and 189 ( 83 . 6 % ) were detected through mass screening . Most ( 77 . 0 % ) had possible COVID - 19 symptoms , including respiratory symptoms and signs ( 44 . 5 % ) and fever ( 46 . 5 % ) and 23 . 0 % were asymptomatic . 116 ( 51 . 4 % ) patients received a course of oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin ( HCQ - AZM ) for ≥3 days , and 47 ( 20 . 8 % ) died . Through multivariate analysis , the death rate was positively associated with being male ( 30 . 7 % , vs . 14 . 0 % , OR = 3 . 95 , p = 0 . 002 ) , being older than 85 years ( 26 . 1 % , vs . 15 . 6 % , OR = 2 . 43 , p = 0 . 041 ) , and receiving oxygen therapy ( 39 . 0 % , vs . 12 . 9 % , OR = 5 . 16 , p < 0 . 001 ) and negatively associated with being diagnosed through mass screening ( 16 . 9 % , vs . 40 . 5 % , OR = 0 . 20 , p = 0 . 001 ) and receiving HCQ - AZM treatment ≥3 days ( 15 . 5 % , vs . 26 . 4 % , OR = 0 . 37 , p = 0 . 02 ) . Conclusion . High proportion of asymptomatic COVID - 19 patients and independent factors for mortality suggests that early diagnosis and treatment of COVID - 19 patients in LTCFs may be effective in saving lives . Introduction In France , as of 2 June 2020 , 10 , 350 elderly residents living in long - term care facilities or medical - social establishments had died from COVID - 19 ( 27 . 6 % lethality rate ) accounting for 55 . 6 % of COVID - 19 deaths in France [ 1 ] . Similar pictures have also been reported in many European countries [ 2 ] and worldwide [ 3 ] . The prevalence of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases , hypertension and diabetes mellitus is high among elderly persons living in long - term care facilities ; coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) in this population may therefore have severe outcomes with a high mortality rate [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . Other drivers of mortality among elderly persons living in long - term care facilities already include type of facility , the amount of persons visiting the facilities during the week previous to lockdown , staff ratios [ 3 ] , and lagged infection in staff members [ 6 ] . The treatment of COVID - 19 has been the subject of widespread controversy , in particular with regards to the use of hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) [ 7 ] . It appears to us that some of the elements of the controversy are the heterogeneity of protocols using HCQ , with doses ranging from 800 mg to 1200 mg per day , the duration of treatment , whether or not it is combined with azithromycin ( AZM ) , and the stage of the disease at which patients were being treated . It can be considered that there is a purely viral phase of the disease with a more or less strong immune response , which can become predominant in what has been referred to as the cytokine storm , followed in a number of cases , by necrotic lesions , linked to pulmonary infarctions [ 8 ] . Furthermore , mortality depends very significantly on age and thus , in Europe , almost all deaths have been among persons over the age of 60 , with more than 50 % in persons over the age of 85 years [ 9 ] . Under these conditions , it is very difficult to carry out comparative studies addressing the effect of HCQ on COVID - 19 - associated deaths . Very few randomised studies have been conducted and their interpretations have also led to heated debate . To assist the debate , we believe that it may be important to assess whether there is a clear reduction in mortality in the most at - risk groups . In Marseille , over a period of approximately two months , we were able to test and treat COVID - 19 patients in long - term care facilities ( Etablissement d’Hébergement pour Personnes Agées Dépendantes – EHPAD ) with a combination of HCQ - AZM , as we have described it on several occasions [ 8 , 10 - 12 ] . The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 carriage among elderly residents and among staff members working in 24 EHPAD , Marseille , France . We also aimed to estimate the lethality among elderly residents treated in these EHPADs and informally compare it to the lethality of patients in these EHPAD who were not treated s and the general lethality of patients in EHPADs in France . Methods Setting , study design and population SARS - CoV - 2 cross - sectional mass screening campaigns were conducted among residents and staff members from 24 long - term care facilities ( EHPADs ) in Marseille , between 24 March and 2 June 2020 . In some centres , screening campaigns were conducted following the diagnosis of confirmed COVID - 19 cases in symptomatic patients who were sampled on a case - by - case strategy . In other centres , screening campaigns were conducted systematically . In all cases , screening campaigns were conducted following a request from the directors and medical staff of the long - term care facilities . Nasopharyngeal samples were processed for SARS - CoV - 2 PCR testing at the Institut Hospitalo - Universitaire ( IHU ) Méditerranée Infection at Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Marseille ( AP - HM ) , as previously described [ 13 ] or in private laboratories in Marseille , in some cases . Residents who tested positive were either i ) treated at their long - term care facilities by local medical staff only , ii ) treated at their long - term care facilities in coordination with the AP - HM Home Hospitalisation Unit ( HHU ) , iii ) admitted to the IHU ( day - care hospital or conventional units ) , or iv ) transferred to AP - MH Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) . For confirmed cases , information on demographics , chronic medical conditions , COVID - 19 treatment and clinical data including fever , asthenia , anorexia and weight loss , respiratory symptoms and signs ( cough , rhinorrhoea , dyspnoea , chest pain , acute respiratory distress syndrome ) and death was collected retrospectively from interviews with the medical team of 24 long - term care facilities and the electronic health recording systems of the AP - HM . Statistical methods Statistical procedures were performed using STATA 11 . 1 . We used Pearson’s chi - square or Fisher’s exact tests to compare differences between groups of patients where appropriate . A two - sided p - value of less than 0 . 05 was considered to be statistically significant . A separate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for SARS - CoV - 2 death prevalence among all elderly residents testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . The results were presented by percentages and odds ratio ( OR ) with a 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) . The initial model included variables presenting a p - value < 0 . 2 . The stepwise regression procedure and likelihood - ratio tests were applied to determine the final model . Results Over the study period , 1 , 691 elderly residents and 1 , 000 staff members were tested ( Table 1 ) . For residents , the sex ratio ( male to female ) was 1 : 1 . 8 and the mean age ( ± standard derivation [ SD ] ) was 83 . 0 ( ±10 . 6 ) years ( ranging from 50 to 106 years ) . For staff members , the sex ratio was 1 : 3 . 5 and the mean age ( ± SD ) was 40 . 8 ( ±12 . 8 ) years ( ranging from 18 to 87 years ) . It should be noted that two religious staff members at one long - term care facility were aged 75 and 87 , respectively . Overall , 313 participants ( of 2 , 691 , 11 . 6 % ) were confirmed positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . The prevalence among residents ( 226 of 1 , 691 , 13 . 4 % ) was significantly higher than among staff members ( 87 of 1 , 000 , 8 . 7 % ) , p < 0 . 001 ) . With regard to the housing facilities , at least one individual was positive in 11 / 24 ( 45 . 8 % ) centres with prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 detection ranging from 0 % to 57 . 6 % among residents and from 0 % to 24 . 1 % among staff members ( Table 1 ) . The lethality rate among residents was 20 . 8 % while no deaths occurred among staff members ( p < 10 - 4 ) . Characteristics of 226 elderly residents testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( Tables 2 and 3 ) Of the 226 SARS - CoV - 2 - positive elderly residents , 37 were diagnosed on a case - by - case basis through selected sampling of patients with COVID - 19 symptoms and 189 ( 83 . 4 % ) were detected through mass screening . Regarding co - morbidities , the most frequent chronic condition was hypertension ( 39 . 6 % ) , followed by other cardiovascular diseases ( 37 . 1 % ) , dementia ( 28 . 9 % ) and other mental disorders ( 23 . 6 % ) . In terms of clinical findings , 77 . 0 % had possible COVID - 19 symptoms , including respiratory symptoms and signs ( 44 . 5 % ) , and fever ( 46 . 5 % ) ; and 23 . 0 % had no COVID - 19 symptoms representing 24 . 8 % ( 40 / 161 ) of individuals tested through mass screening ( Table 2 ) . When it came to therapeutic management , 62 ( 27 . 4 % ) patients were managed within their long - term care facilities by local medical staff only , 117 ( 51 . 8 % ) were managed within their long - term care facility in collaboration with the HHU , 16 ( 7 . 1 % ) were admitted to IHU , and 31 ( 13 . 7 % ) were transferred to ICU . Overall , 116 ( 51 . 4 % ) patients received an oral HCQ ( 200 mg three times daily for ten days ) , and AZM ( 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days ) for at least three days and were monitored as described in previous studies [ 10 - 12 ] . Of the 110 others ( 48 . 6 % ) , one ( 0 . 4 % ) received a two - day course of HCQ - AZM , one ( 0 . 4 % ) received HCQ alone , 37 ( 16 . 4 % ) received AZM alone , and 71 ( 31 . 4 ) did not receive either drug . The prevalence of HCQ - AZM treatment for at least three days ranged from 0 % - 87 . 5 % according to the housing facilities . Other treatments are described in Table 2 . A total of 179 patients survived ( 79 . 2 % ) and 47 ( 20 . 8 % ) died . The baseline characteristics of 116 patients who received HCQ - AZM treatment for at least three days compared with 110 patients who did not receive the treatment were largely similar ( Table 3 ) . A higher proportion of patients with a history of stroke was observed in the treated group ( 15 . 8 % ) compared with the untreated group ( 5 . 2 % , p = 0 . 04 ) . Table 4 shows the lethality rate among elderly residents with SARS - CoV - 2 infection , according to demographics , chronic conditions , circumstance of diagnosis , type of medical management of patients , use of HCQ - AZM and housing facility effect according to prevalence of HCQ - AZM treatment for at least three days in each housing facility . Under univariate analysis , death from COVID - 19 was significantly associated with male gender . In addition , patients who were diagnosed on a case - by case basis due to their COVID - 19 symptoms were more likely to die ( 40 . 5 % ) than those diagnosed through systematic screening ( 16 . 9 % ) . Finally , patients who received oxygen treatment were more likely to die ( 39 . 0 % ) than those who did not receive such a treatment ( 12 . 9 % ) , by contract , patients who received HCQ - AZM treatment for at least three days were less likely to die ( 15 . 5 % ) than those who did not receive such a treatment ( 26 . 4 % ) . Through multivariate analysis , the death rate was positively associated with being male ( 30 . 7 % vs . 14 . 0 % , OR = 3 . 95 [ 1 . 65 - 9 . 44 ] , p = 0 . 002 ) , being older than 85 years ( 26 . 1 % vs . 15 . 6 % , OR = 2 . 43 [ 1 . 04 - 5 . 69 ] , p = 0 . 041 ) , and receiving oxygen therapy ( OR = 5 . 16 [ 2 . 26 - 11 . 76 ] , p < 10 - 4 ) and negatively associated with being diagnosed through mass screening ( 16 . 9 % , vs . 40 . 5 % , OR = 0 . 20 [ 0 . 08 - 0 . 53 ] , p = 0 . 001 ) and receiving HCQ - AZM treatment for at least three days ( OR = 0 . 37 [ 0 . 17 - 0 . 86 ] , p = 0 . 02 ) . Discussion In Marseille , the first case of COVID - 19 in the general population was diagnosed on 3 March 2020 and the epidemic peaked during the first week of April and remained active until the end of the month . Our survey of long - term care facilities began when the entire French population was placed under a strict lockdown ( 17 March ) and when the epidemic was active in Marseille . All long - term care facilities became confined environments with very strict restrictions being place upon visits . We found a 13 . 4 % SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rate among dependant elderly residents in Marseille that was significantly higher than the 5 . 4 % positivity rate among all French dependant elderly residents according to a national survey ( 37 , 405 confirmed cases in an estimated 695 , 060 French dependant elderly residents , p < 0 . 001 , 2 June update ) [ 1 , 14 ] . We observed an overall 20 . 8 % COVID - 19 lethality rate among infected residents in Marseille that was significantly lower than that in all French long - term care facilities or medical - social establishments ( 27 . 7 % lethality rate , p = 0 . 026 , 2 June update ) [ 1 ] . The main drivers of mortality in Marseille residents were older age and male sex , as already reported in many studies [ 15 ] . In addition , systematic screening by PCR was identified as an independent protective factor against death from COVID - 19 . A symptom - based diagnostic strategy is less effective in long - term care facilities , most likely because elderly patients with comorbidities such as chronic respiratory or cardiovascular diseases may be unable to accurately report new symptoms suggestive of COVID - infection or may present with atypical symptoms that challenge medical staff [ 13 , 17 ] . Furthermore , in our experience , more than 23 % of SARS - CoV - 2 infected residents had no symptoms at the time of sampling . A very high prevalence ( around 80 % ) was observed in a cross - sectional study conducted on elderly residents living in 2074 Belgian long - term care facilities [ 18 ] . In this study , we show that there was a significant difference in lethality between patients treated with our standardised treatment and untreated patients , as already reported in study conducted among elderly patients living in a Spanish public nursing home in the same period [ 14 ] . Treatment with HCQ alone was demonstrated to be associated with lower mortality in patients admitted with COVID - 19 [ 20 - 23 ] . Another cohort study conducted among American patients with rheumatic conditions showed an association between long - term HCQ treatment and reduced COVID - 19 lethality rate [ 24 ] . The potential mechanisms of HCQ in the decrease of mortality in COVID - 19 might be its inhibitory effects upon the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines interleukin ( IL ) - 1 - β , TNF - α and IL - 6 , and chemokines ( CCL2 and CCL3 ) involved in the recruitment of pro - inflammatory cells in the lung [ 25 ] . There are some limitations to our study . Our study population was not randomly and homogenously recruited . Data regarding demographics , chronic conditions and clinical status was not systematically documented . Frailty that has been shown to be a major risk factor for mortality in COVID - 19 was not evaluated in this study due to its retrospective design [ 26 ] . The use of individual preventive measures was not documented . Nevertheless , we believe that even if there are biases , as in any comparative study including randomisation , these biases are relatively neutralised by the multifactorial study . Above all , we demonstrate that the mortality in patients treated in EHPADs in Marseille was half that of patients in nursing homes across France who , in most cases very likely did not receive specific treatment since its use is restricted to the hospital setting [ 27 , 28 ] . We believe that focusing on the population with the highest mortality , to show a significant effect , is important and agree in this sense with several studies that have shown a reduction in mortality of 30 to 50 % by HCQ - AZM in populations most at risk [ 29 , 8 ] .
