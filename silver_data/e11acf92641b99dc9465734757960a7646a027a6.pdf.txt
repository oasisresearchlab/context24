The sorting nexin , SNX9 , localizes to clathrin - coated pits where it interacts with dynamin and functions in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Here , we demonstrate that SNX9 also localizes to actin - rich structures implicated in ﬂuid - phase uptake , including tubular mem - branes containing GPI - anchored proteins and dorsal membrane rufﬂes . Moreover , we show that SNX9 is critical for dorsal rufﬂe formation and for clathrin - independent , actin - dependent ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . In vitro , SNX9 directly associates with N - WASP , an Arp2 / 3 complex activator , and stimulates N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly . SNX9 - stimulated actin polymerization is greatly enhanced by PI 4 , 5 P 2 - containing liposomes , due in part to PI 4 , 5 P 2 - induced SNX9 oligomerization . These results suggest a mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of N - WASP - dependent actin assembly and implicate SNX9 in directly coupling actin dynamics to membrane remod - eling during multiple modes of endocytosis . INTRODUCTION Cells take up macromolecules and ﬂuids through diverse endocytic pathways including macropinocytosis , cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolin - mediated endocy - tosis , and clathrin / caveolin - independent endocytosis ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ) . Clathrin / caveolin - indepen - dent endocytosis encompasses several distinct , poorly characterized pathways ( Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ) . For example , a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway is induced upon dominant interference of dynamin GTPase activity , a key regulator of multiple endocytic pathways ( Damke et al . , 1995 ) , whereas a clathrin - independent , dynamin - and RhoA - dependent endocytic pathway is used by the interleukin 2 receptor ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , recent studies have focused on a clathrin / caveolin - independentendocyticpathwayusedbyGPI - an - chored proteins ( GPI - APs ) that are internalized through tubular invaginations in the plasma membrane and trafﬁc through a compartment called the GPI - AP - enriched early endosomal compartment ( GEEC ) ( Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ; MayorandRiezman , 2004 ; Sabharanjaketal . , 2002 ) . Although clathrin - , caveolin - , and clathrin / caveolin - in - dependent pathways are mechanistically distinct , many require the spatial and temporal coordination of F - actin assembly . Actin assembly plays a role in membrane remodeling events such as protrusion during macropino - cytosis , invagination during clathrin - and caveolin - depen - dent endocytosis , and vesicle ﬁssion ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Merriﬁeld et al . , 2002 , 2005 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Swanson and Watts , 1995 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . However , little is known about the factors controlling the coordina - tion of F - actin polymerization with membranes during these modes of endocytosis . A small subset of endocytic accessory proteins has been implicated in functioning at the interface between membranes and the F - actin cytoskeleton . For example , Hip1R , Toca1 , Cip4 , and FBP17 contain phospholipid - binding domains and directly interact with components of the F - actin cytoskeleton ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . However , it is unclear if any of these proteins utilize their lipid - binding properties to directly modulate F - actin dynamics . Thus , the proteins that directly convey signals from membranes to the regulation of F - actin dynamics for membrane remodeling during endocytosis remain to be deﬁned . We and others previously identiﬁed the sorting nexin , SNX9 , as a major binding partner of dynamin ( Lundmark and Carlsson , 2004 ; Soulet et al . , 2005 ) . SNX9 is essential for efﬁcient clathrin - mediated endocytosis and is tran - siently recruited to clathrin - coated pits , along with dyna - min , during late stages of vesicle formation ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ) . The SNX family is deﬁned by the phox homology ( PX ) domain , a phospholipid - binding module ( Seet and Hong , 2006 ) . SNX9 also contains an N - terminal SH3 domain that participates in protein - protein interactions and a BAR ( Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ) domain , a second phospholipid - binding region that also functions in dimer - ization ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . SNX9 has been linked to the Developmental Cell 13 , 43 – 56 , July 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 43 F - actin cytoskeleton through an interaction with WASP ( Worby et al . , 2001 ; Badour et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting it may function in both endocytic and actin - related processes . Here , we establish that SNX9 is required for clathrin - independent , actin - dependent ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . SNX9 directly regulates F - actin nucleation through N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex , and this activity is syner - gistically enhanced by PI 4 , 5 P 2 - containing liposomes . Our ﬁndings suggest a mechanism by which SNX9 physically couples F - actin nucleation to plasma membrane remodel - ing during endocytosis . RESULTS SNX9 Localizes with F - Actin - Rich Structures Implicated in Endocytosis SNX9 transiently localizes to clathrin - coated pits on the plasma membrane , prior to vesicle formation ( Lundmark and Carlsson , 2004 ; Soulet et al . , 2005 ) . However , in BSC1 epithelial cells expressing clathrin light chain - EGFP , we also observed surface - associated mCherry - SNX9 at sites other than those corresponding to coated pits , suggesting that it may associate with other endocytic sites . Therefore , to further investigate SNX9’s function , we examined its subcellular localization by double label - ing with other markers for endocytosis . The GEEC pathway for internalization of GPI - APs has been reported to participate in the uptake of a large frac - tion of the ﬂuid phase ( Guha et al . , 2003 ; Kirkham et al . , 2005 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . Using time - lapse total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIR - FM ) , we observed mCherry - SNX9 along the length of dynamic ve - sicular and tubular structures that were labeled with the model GPI - anchored protein , GFP - GPI . In addition , while we detected SNX9 foci devoid of GFP - GPI , we frequently observed bright mCherry - SNX9 foci transiently associ - ated with the edges of these dynamic GFP - GPI tubules ( Figure 1A and see Movie S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . Since SNX9 has been linked with WASP - family proteins ( Worby et al . , 2001 ; Badour et al . , 2007 ) , regulators of the actin cytoskeleton , we also analyzed the localization of the ubiquitously expressed vertebrate WASP - family protein , N - WASP , and of actin . Like mCherry - SNX9 , mCherry - N - WASP localized along the length of GFP - GPI structures , as well as transiently at the edges of GFP - GPI structures ( Figure 1B ; Movie S2 ) . We also observed ﬂashes of mCherry - actin along the lengths of GFP - GPI tubules , often appearing brighter at the edges ( Figure 1D ; Movie S4 ) . To determine if there was coordination between N - WASP with SNX9 , we analyzed the relative localization of these two proteins and found that 80 ± 13 % of mCherry - SNX9 foci ( mean ± standard deviation , n = 118 , four cells ) transiently colocalized with a subset of EGFP - N - WASP foci ( Figure 1C ; Movie S3 ) . Together , these data suggest that SNX9 , N - WASP , and actin function in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner at sites of GPI - AP - containing membrane tubule formation . Figure 1 .

We also detected punctate signals of SNX9 at circular dorsal rings and at a subset of membrane rufﬂes at the cell periphery in BSC1 , Cos7 , and Swiss 3T3 cells ( Figure 2A ; Figure S1A ; data not shown ) . Structures similar to these have been implicated in ﬂuid - phase endocytosis ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ; Mettlen et al . , 2006 ) . Dorsal rufﬂes and rings are infrequent in normal cell populations but can be induced by treatment with PDGF ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed , PDGF - induced dorsal rufﬂes and rings also contained SNX9 ( Figure 2B ; Figure S1A ) . Previous studies have shown that dorsal rufﬂes and rings are rich in F - actin and in N - WASP ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ) . Based on both ﬁxed and live cell analyses , SNX9 partially colocalized with F - actin in these structures and could often be observed at the center of the dorsal rings ( Figures 2A – 2D ; Figure S1 ) . In living cells stimulated with PDGF , mCherry - SNX9 associated with punctate struc - tures forming a ring at the dorsal surface ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . A subset of these structures constricted over time , and mCherry - SNX9 was associated with tubulo - vesicular structures at the center of the constricted ring ( Figure 2C ; Movie S5 ) . While EGFP - actin localization mostly paralleled that of mCherry - SNX9 in PDGF - induced dorsal rings , EGFP - actin was occasionally observed at the periphery ( Figure 2D ; Movies S6 and S7 ) . In addition , mCherry - SNX9 and EGFP - N - WASP partially colocalized at dorsal rings following PDGF stimulation ( Figure S2 ; Movie S8 ) . Together , these results demonstrate that SNX9 , NWASP , and actin are enriched at multiple F - actin - rich structures implicated in ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . Since SNX9 localized to F - actin - rich dorsal rufﬂes and rings , we tested whether it was required for the formation of these structures . Transfection of siRNAs targeting SNX9 resulted in depletion of greater than 90 % of SNX9 protein but did not alter actin or dynamin levels ( Figure 2E and data not shown ) . F - actin - rich dorsal rufﬂes and rings formed in 74 ± 12 % ( mean ± standard deviation ) of con - trol - depleted cells after PDGF stimulation ( Figure 2F ) , whereas signiﬁcantly fewer SNX9 - depleted cells had dor - sal rufﬂes and rings ( 12 ± 5 % , p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 2F ) . These data demonstrate that , in addition to its known role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , SNX9 is required for the efﬁcient formation of PDGF - induced dorsal rufﬂes and rings on the plasma membrane . SNX9 Is Required for Fluid - Phase Endocytosis The GEEC pathway and peripheral and dorsal membrane rufﬂes have been implicated in endocytosis ( Kirkham and Parton , 2005 , Buccione et al . , 2004 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ; Mettlen et al . , 2006 ) . Consistent with the dynamic associ - ation of SNX9 with these structures , a pronounced inhibi - tion of ﬂuid - phase endocytosis in SNX9 - depleted cells relative to control siRNA - treated cells was observed as measured by the accumulation of Alexa - 568 - labeled dextran ( Figure 3A ) . To quantify this effect , we measured horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) uptake , a well - established ﬂuid - phase marker ( Figure S2A ) . Depletion of SNX9 resulted in a 59 ± 15 % ( n = 3 , p = 0 . 004 ) reduction of con - stitutive HRP internalization in comparison to control - depleted cells ( Figure 3B ) . The speciﬁcity of SNX9 deple - tion was conﬁrmed with an siRNA sequence targeting a second region of SNX9 ( Figures S3B and S3C ) . To deﬁnitively establish that SNX9 functions in non - cla - thrin - dependent endocytosis , we used siRNAs to deplete clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) by 90 % , under conditions which do not alter SNX9 or actin protein levels ( Figure 3B ) . In contrast to SNX9 depletion , CHC depletion did not signiﬁcantly alter the level of HRP uptake ( Figure 3B ; n = 3 ) . In addition , codepletion of CHC and SNX9 did not further reduce HRP uptake over SNX9 depletion alone ( Figure 3B ; n = 3 ) . Thus , in addition to its known role in clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis , SNX9 is also required for a second clathrin - independent , constitutive ﬂuid - phase endocytic pathway . Overexpression of dominant - negative dynamin inhibits both clathrin - and caveolin - mediated endocytosis and induces a clathrin - independent compensatory endocytic pathway ( Damke et al . , 1995 ) . As previously reported , overexpression of dyn2 - K44A did not disrupt ﬂuid - phase internalization of HRP ( Figure 3C ) , indicating that SNX9 depletion and dynamin inhibition differentially effect ﬂuid - phase uptake . Strikingly , SNX9 depletion had no effect on HRP uptake in dyn2 - K44A - expressing cells , demonstrating that SNX9 is not required for the dyn2 - K44A - induced compensatory endocytic pathway . These data underscore the diversity of endocytic machinery used by mammalian cells . Since SNX9 colocalizes with actin at multiple sites on the plasma membrane , we examined whether the SNX9 - dependent ﬂuid - phase endocytic pathway was also actin dependent . Disruption of F - actin with 1 m M latrunculin A ( LatA ) , a drug that sequesters actin monomers ( Coue et al . , 1987 ) , resulted in a 30 ± 7 % ( n = 3 , p = 0 . 008 ) reduc - tion in HRP uptake ( Figure 3D ) . Importantly , treatment of SNX9 - depleted cells with LatA did not further reduce HRP uptake levels ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting that SNX9 functions in a pathway together with F - actin to facilitate ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . SNX9 Stimulates N - WASP - Mediated Activation of the Arp2 / 3 Complex and Promotes F - Actin Branching The spatial and temporal coordination of SNX9 , N - WASP , and actin suggests that these proteins may function together at many sites of endocytosis . N - WASP exists in an autoinhibited conformation that can be relieved by interactions with the Rho - family GTPase Cdc42 , phos - phatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI 4 , 5 P 2 ) , and SH3 do - main - containing binding partners ( Stradal et al . , 2004 ) . Since SNX9 contains an SH3 domain , we examined whether it interacts directly with N - WASP in vitro . As shown in Figure 5B , 6xHis - N - WASP associated with GST - SNX9 but not with GST alone . Therefore , we also ex - amined whether SNX9 could affect the in vitro activities of N - WASP to simulate Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated F - actin nucleation using a pyrene actin assembly assay . In the absence of either N - WASP or the Arp2 / 3 complex , SNX9 Developmental Cell 13 , 43 – 56 , July 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 45 Developmental Cell SNX9 Links Actin Dynamics and Membrane Remodeling 46 Developmental Cell 13 , 43 – 56 , July 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . Developmental Cell SNX9 Links Actin Dynamics and Membrane Remodeling did not signiﬁcantly alter F - actin assembly dynamics ( Figure 4A ) . However , in the presence of both N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 , SNX9 stimulated N - WASP nucleation - pro - moting activity in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 4B ; Figure S4 ) . Using a more stringent test , we found that SNX9 also activated D EVH1 N - WASP , an N - WASP trun - cation mutant lacking the WH1 / EVH1 domain ( D EVH1 N - WASP ) that exhibits increased autoinhibition ( Figure 4C ; Figure S4 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of actin ﬁlaments and promotes the growth and nucleation of new ﬁlaments to drive the formation of branched , dendritic F - actin arrays in vivo and in vitro ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . Stimulation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation by WASP - family pro - teins increases the formation of F - actin branches ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ) . To determine whether SNX9 stimu - lates F - actin nucleation and branching by Arp2 / 3 , we visualized the actin structures formed using TIR - FM of ﬂuorescent actin ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . In the absence of other proteins , actin assembled into long , linear ﬁla - ments ( Figure 4D [ top panel ] ; Movie S9 ) . However , consis - tent with previous work , in the presence of the Arp2 / 3 complex and D EVH1 N - WASP , actin ﬁlaments formed dendritic assemblies with many F - actin Y branches ( Figure 4D [ middle panel ] ; Movie S9 ) . While SNX9 alone did not alter the morphology of the linear actin structures ( data not shown ) , addition of SNX9 to a mixture of the Arp2 / 3 complex and D EVH1 N - WASP dramatically in - creased the density of the branches that assembled ( Figure 4D [ bottom panel ] ; Movie S9 ) . In total , these results demonstrate that SNX9 binds to and stimulates N - WASP activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , yielding highly branched arrays of F - actin . The SH3 Domain of SNX9 Is Necessary but Not Sufﬁcient for Full N - WASP Activation To identify the regions of SNX9 required for binding to and activating N - WASP , we generated deletion mutants Figure 2 .

Developmental Cell 13 , 43 – 56 , July 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 47 Developmental Cell SNX9 Links Actin Dynamics and Membrane Remodeling lacking the SH3 ( D SH3 SNX9 ) or PX ( D PX SNX9 ) domains , and a fragment of SNX9 containing only the SH3 domain ( Figure 5A ; Figure S5 ) . SNX9 mutants lacking the BAR do - main or mutated to compromise BAR domain activity were insoluble ( data not shown ) , precluding their analysis . SNX9 derivatives containing the SH3 domain ( GST - D PX SNX9 and GST - SH3 ) interacted with recombinant N - WASP and D EVH1 N - WASP in a GST pull - down assay ( Figure 5B ; data not shown ) . In contrast , GST - D SH3 SNX9 was unable to bind to either N - WASP derivative , demonstrating that the SH3 domain is both necessary and sufﬁcient for the N - WASP interaction ( Figure 5B ) . We next tested the relative abilities of the SNX9 deriva - tives to activate the nucleation - promoting activity of N - WASP . Addition of 1 m M His - D PX SNX9 , and to a lesser extent GST - SNX9 SH3 , to N - WASP or D EVH1 NWASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex increased the rate of F - actin assembly ( Figures 5C and 5D ; Figure S5B ) . However , these SNX9 derivatives activated N - WASP less than full - length SNX9 , indicating that multiple regions of SNX9 are required for maximal stimulatory activity . In contrast , His - D SH3 SNX9 was unable to stimulate N - WASP activity and may exhibit a subtle inhibitory effect on N - WASP activation ( Figure 5C ) . Thus , although the SH3 domain of SNX9 is sufﬁcient for interaction with N - WASP , additional regions of SNX9 are required for full activation of N - WASP . SNX9 Synergizes with PI 4 , 5 P 2 to Activate N - WASP Our in vivo and in vitro data suggest that SNX9 activates N - WASP to trigger Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly at sites of plasma membrane deformation during endocyto - sis and membrane rufﬂing . The plasma membrane is en - riched in and in part deﬁned by PI 4 , 5 P 2 , which can partially promote N - WASP activity ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . SNX9 also interacts directly with phosphatidylinositols through its lipid - binding PX and BAR domains ( Lundmark and Carls - son , 2003 ) . Therefore , to determine whether the lipid envi - ronment can inﬂuence SNX9 activity , we examined if inter - action with PI 4 , 5 P 2 - containing liposomes enhanced its ability to stimulate N - WASP . To maximize sensitivity , we tested the effects of PI 4 , 5 P 2 and SNX9 on the activity of strongly autoinhibited D EVH1 N - WASP . Under these as - say conditions , addition of either 100 nM SNX9 or 50 m M PI 4 , 5 P 2 - containing liposomes alone did not activate N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly ( Figure 6A ) . How - ever , whenSNX9and50 m MPI 4 , 5 P 2 liposomeswereadded together , we observed a synergistic activation of D EVH1 N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 6A ) . Importantly , Figure 4 .

Developmental Cell SNX9 Links Actin Dynamics and Membrane Remodeling in the absence of D EVH1 N - WASP , addition of SNX9 and 50 m M PI 4 , 5 P 2 had no effect on the rate of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly ( Figure S6A ) . Interestingly , this synergistic activity of SNX9 with PI 4 , 5 P 2 liposomes required their preincubation for 30 min at 25 (cid:3) C prior to addition to the actin assembly mix . Combining 100 nM SNX9 with either 50 m M ( Figure 6A ) or 100 m M ( data not shown ) PI 4 , 5 P 2 liposomes without any prior incubation did not synergisti - cally activate N - WASP . This effect was also dependent on the presence of PI 4 , 5 P 2 , because PC liposomes did not affect actin polymerization ( Figures S6B and S6C ) . The ability of SNX9 to synergize with PI 4 , 5 P 2 depends on the lipid - binding domains of SNX9 as neither D PX SNX9 nor GST - SH3 SNX9 exhibited synergy with PI 4 , 5 P 2 lipo - somes ( Figure 6B ) . These results demonstrate that the presenceofthelipid - bindingandSH3domainsinSNX9to - gether promote N - WASP - and Arp2 / 3 - dependent F - actin nucleation . Other BAR / F - BAR and SH3 domain - containing proteins have been identiﬁed that associate with N - WASP and therefore have the potential to simultaneously interact with phosphatidylinositols and N - WASP ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , we tested whether the activation by PI 4 , 5 P 2 - containing liposomes was speciﬁc to SNX9 . Simi - lar to SNX9 , syndapin II is an F - BAR and SH3 domain - containing protein that associates with N - WASP in cell lysates and has been suggested to regulate F - actin assembly during endocytosis ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2002 ; Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) . Immobilized GST - syndapin II was able to pull down recombinant D EVH1 N - WASP ( Figure 6C ) , although to a much lower extent than the GST - SH3 domain of SNX9 . Consistent with this , syndapin II could also stimulate the activity of D EVH1 N - WASP , albeit to a lower extent than SNX9 ( Figure 6D ) . In contrast , syndapin II did not synergistically activate D EVH1 N - WASP when preincubated with PI 4 , 5 P 2 liposomes ( Fig - ure 6F ) , even though it was able to bind to and cosediment with these liposomes ( Figure 6E ) . These results establish speciﬁcity with respect to the ability of SNX9 to synergize with PI 4 , 5 P 2 liposomes . Oligomeric SNX9 Exhibits Higher Activity Than Dimeric SNX9 The requirement for preincubation to detect PI 4 , 5 P 2 stimu - lation of SNX9 suggests that a structural or conformational change may be necessary to mediate this effect . In the course of purifying recombinant SNX9 by gel ﬁltration , we observed twoHis - SNX9species , oneeluting withaStokes radius of 6 . 2 – 8 . 0 nm and a more variably present larger species eluting with a Stokes radius of 13 . 5 – 16 . 8 nm .

To - gether these hydrodynamic properties indicate that the smaller species corresponds to a dimer of SNX9 , while the larger species consists of an oligomer of 5 – 10 subunits . Figure 5 .

While as little as 30 nM SNX9 oligomer potently stimulated D EVH1 NWASP and Arp2 / 3 complex - medi - ated F - actin assembly in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig - ure 7D ; Figure S7 ) , under these conditions 125 nM SNX9 dimer had little effect . Importantly , in control experiments , we found that oligomeric SNX9 ( Figure 7C ) , like dimeric SNX9 ( Figure 4A ) , had no effect on F - actin polymerization when assayed in the absence of either D EVH1 N - WASP or the Arp2 / 3 complex . The ability of dimeric SNX9 to stimulate N - WASP activ - ity is potently enhanced by either preincubation with PI 4 , 5 P 2 liposomes or by SNX9 oligomerization . To test for a relationship between these two conditions , we per - formed nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of excess detergent to assess the oligo - merization state of SNX9 following preincubation with PI 4 , 5 P 2 liposomes ( Figure 7E ) . In the absence of Figure 6 .

Developmental Cell SNX9 Links Actin Dynamics and Membrane Remodeling liposomes , SNX9 primarily migrated near the bottom of the gel , consistent with its dimeric nature . Incubation of di - meric SNX9 with detergent alone or with PC liposomes , which do not bind to SNX9 , did not alter its migration prop - erties in the native gel . In contrast , incubation of SNX9 with PI 4 , 5 P 2 - containing liposomes signiﬁcantly slowed the mi - gration of SNX9 , suggesting the formation of oligomers ( Figure 7E ) . To determine if association with a lipid mem - brane is sufﬁcient to induce oligomerization and activation of SNX9 , His - SNX9 was incubated with nickel - NTA - con - taining liposomes ( 15 mol % Ni - NTA and 85 mol % PC ) and examined for its activity level and oligomerization state . In this experiment , untagged D EVH1 N - WASP was used so that the His tag did not affect interpretation of re - sults . Although His - SNX9 efﬁciently pelleted with nickel - NTA - containing liposomes ( Figure S7B ) , this interaction did not induce SNX9 oligomerization ( Figure 7E ) or en - hance D EVH1 N - WASP activity ( Figure 7F ) . Taken to - gether , these data suggest that in the presence of PI 4 , 5 P 2 , SNX9 is induced to undergo oligomerization that in turn results in a dramatic increase in the ability of SNX9 to activate N - WASP . These ﬁndings suggest a novel mechanism by which SNX9 can couple phosphoinositide signaling to actin assembly and affect plasma membrane remodeling during endocytosis . DISCUSSION SNX9 Functions in Coupling Actin Dynamics to Membrane Remodeling in Multiple Modes of Endocytosis F - actin dynamics play a critical role in remodeling the plasma membrane . However , the mechanism coupling regulation of F - actin assembly to membrane remodeling during endocytosis has remained poorly deﬁned . Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches , we have identiﬁed SNX9 as a molecular link that could couple membrane association with de novo F - actin nucleation through modulation of N - WASP activity during multiple modes of endocytosis . In addition to the previously established requirement for SNX9 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ) , we now show that SNX9 participates in clathrin - independent , F - actin - dependent constitutive ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . SNX9 , N - WASP , and actin assembly are spatially and temporally coordinated at membrane tu - bules containing GPI - APs , and the dynamics of actin as - sembly appear to locally correlate with tubule motion . This suggests the involvement of these proteins in the re - cently identiﬁed GEEC pathway thought to be a major route for the uptake of GPI - APs and ﬂuid ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ; Mayor and Riezman , 2004 ) . SNX9 , N - WASP , and actin dynamics are also spatio - temporally coordinated with the motion of PDGF - induced dorsal rufﬂes and rings , suggesting that rufﬂe motion is powered by SNX9 - medi - ated actin assembly ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ; Legg et al . , 2007 ; this study ) . SNX9 , N - WASP , and actin are also re - cruited to clathrin - coated pits on the plasma membrane at late stages of clathrin - coated vesicle formation ( Merri - ﬁeld et al . , 2002 , 2004 ; Soulet et al . , 2005 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . As siRNA - mediated depletion of SNX9 inhibits ﬂuid - phase endocytosis , membrane rufﬂing , and cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ; this study ) , we propose that the local recruitment of SNX9 to membrane sites of endocytosis results in N - WASP activa - tion to promote the local assembly of a dendritic actin net - work through activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The force generated by network assembly at the membrane then drives the local membrane deformations required for speciﬁc aspects of these different modes of endocytosis . Although SNX9 is a major dynamin - binding partner ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ) , SNX9 depletion inhibits ﬂuid - phase uptake , while dominant interference of dynamin does not . Because dominant - negative dynamin expression induces a dynamin - and clathrin - independent compensa - tory endocytic pathway that is also independent of SNX9 , we cannot conclude that SNX9 functions independently of dynamin during ﬂuid - phase uptake . Nevertheless , induc - tion of a compensatory pathway upon inhibition of endo - cytosis by dynamin , but not after depletion of either SNX9 or clathrin , is an unexpected observation that underscores the diversity and versatility of endocytic pathways in mammalian cells . Together , our results dem - onstrate a novel role for SNX9 during multiple modes of endocytosis . Oligomerization and PI 4 , 5 P 2 - Containing Liposomes Enhance SNX9 Activity Recombinant SNX9 exists predominantly as a dimer . However , we were also able to isolate a small proportion of SNX9 as a higher - order oligomer and show that this oligomeric species was dramatically more active in stimu - lating N - WASP - and Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly . Although the mechanism of oligomerization in E . coli is unclear , it may reﬂect either the high concentration of recombinant protein in the bacterium - promoted His - SNX9 assembly or the association of recombinant SNX9 with bacterial proteins , lipids , or polyphosphates . Regard - less , this fortuitous observation provided mechanistic insight into SNX9 activation . Interestingly , other BAR - and F - BAR - containing proteins , including FBP17 , CIP4 , and syndapin II , have also been suggested to oligomerize ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . However , no activity has been previously connected with this oligomerization . SNX9 oligomerization is promoted by PI 4 , 5 P 2 binding . PI 4 , 5 P 2 - induced SNX9 assembly may result from an in - creased local concentration of SNX9 on the 2D surface of the liposome and / or from a conformational change that facilitates oligomerization . Importantly , forced inter - action of His - SNX9 with nickel - NTA - containing liposomes failed to promote SNX9 assembly , suggesting that a phos - phoinositide interaction is required . Although we cannot exclude the possibility that incubation of SNX9 with lipo - somes might modify the lipid environment ( i . e . , by cluster - ing the PI 4 , 5 P 2 ) , we suggest that the increased activity observed upon liposome association is a result of SNX9 oligomerization and may partly result from N - WASP clus - tering . Previous in vivo studies have shown that artiﬁcially Developmental Cell 13 , 43 – 56 , July 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 51 Developmental Cell SNX9 Links Actin Dynamics and Membrane Remodeling Figure 7 .

Developmental Cell SNX9 Links Actin Dynamics and Membrane Remodeling induced clustering of WASP ( a hematopoetic - speciﬁc WASP - family protein , structurally similar to N - WASP ) on the plasma membrane resulted in F - actin polymerization and the formation of membrane protrusions ( Castellano et al . , 1999 ) . Alternatively , or in addition , the increase in SNX9’s stimulation of N - WASP could be caused by a con - formational change within SNX9 that releases an autoinhi - bitory , intramolecular interaction ( Worby et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , interaction with PI 4 , 5 P 2 liposomes could modulate inter - and intramolecular interactions that regulate both SNX9 oligomerization and autoinhibition . The ﬁnding that SNX9 has broad phospholipid - binding speciﬁcity ( Lundmark and Carlsson , 2003 ) suggests that other phosphatidylinositols may also regulate SNX9 activ - ity . Indeed , it was recently shown that T cell / CD28 stimu - lation induces the formation of a multimeric signaling complex containing SNX9 , WASP , and p85 , the regulatory subunit of PI - 3 kinase , at sites of clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( Badour et al . , 2007 ) . These data support a more general role for SNX9 in coupling phosphoinositide signal - ing to actin dynamics during endocytosis . A Model for SNX9 Regulation of Actin Assembly at the Plasma Membrane Together , our in vivo and in vitro data suggest a mecha - nism by which SNX9 spatially and temporally coordinates F - actin nucleation and membrane remodeling during endocytosis ( Figure 7G ) . We propose that the discrete accumulation of SNX9 observed at the tips of GFP - GPI tubules and the dynamic association of SNX9 with mem - brane rufﬂes reﬂects a PI 4 , 5 P 2 - induced critical , activating conformational change that is followed by SNX9 self - assembly . Interestingly , we have previously observed a similar ‘‘burst’’ of SNX9 at clathrin - coated pits ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ) . Since we ﬁnd that localization of SNX9 and N - WASP is spatially and temporally coordinated , we pro - pose that the locally activated SNX9 both clusters and stimulates N - WASP to promote Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin ﬁlament nucleation . Filament elongation of a highly branched actin network would provide the force required for membrane reshaping during vesicle invagination and / or scission and for the extension of dorsal rufﬂes . Consis - tent with this , actin also appeared brighter at the edges of dynamic GFP - GPI tubules and colocalized with SNX9 in PDGF - induced rufﬂes . Further work will be necessary to test aspects of this model and to deﬁne the mechanisms of SNX9 regulation in coordinating actin assembly with membrane remodeling during endocytosis .

For PDGF stimu - lation , cells were starved for 24 hr in DMEM containing 0 . 2 % FCS and stimulated for 5 min with 30 ng / ml PDGF - BB ( Calbiochem ) before ﬁxation and staining . Images were obtained as previously described ( Wittmann et al . , 2003 ) . To image mCherry - SNX9 , EGFP - NWASP , GFP - GPI , or mCherry - actin , plasmids were transfected into BSC1 cells with Effectene ( QIA - GEN ) and imaged 16 – 20 hr posttransfection . Near - simultaneous , total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIR - FM ) images of mCherry - or EGFP - fusion proteins were collected at 2 . 5 – 5 s intervals using an Orca II / ERG CCD camera in 14 - bit mode ( Adams et al . , 2004 ; Soulet et al . , 2005 ) .

Images were collected using an AxioCam HRm digital camera ( Zeiss ) . Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation Recombinant human Arp2 / 3 complex ( Goley et al . , 2004 ) , rabbit skel - etal muscle actin ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) , and pyrene - labeled actin ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) were prepared as described previously . Rabbit muscle myosin II was provided by Ron Milligan ( TSRI ) . GST - and His - tagged SNX9 derivatives and His - D EVH1 N - WASP ( aa138 – 501 ) were expressed in BL21 - DE3 E . coli , and cell lysates were subjected to afﬁnity puriﬁcation using glutathione - Sepharose 4B ( Amersham Bioscience ) forGST - fusionproteinsorNi - NTA agarose ( QIAGEN ) for His - tagged proteins according to the manufacturer’s in - structions . Except for GST - syndapin II , all peak fractions were further puriﬁed over a Superose 6 10 / 300 gel ﬁltration column into control buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , and 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . Untagged syn - dapin II was cleaved from GST - syndapin II with PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare ) and puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration . Bovine 6xHis - N - WASP was expressed in Tn5 cells using the baculovirus expression system . Thawed cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM NaPhosphate ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 400 mM KCl , centrifuged , and puriﬁed as above , except that the control buffer contained 300 mM KCl . Actin Assembly Assays Pyrene actin assembly assays were performed as previously de - scribed ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) . Unless otherwise stated , pyrene assays were in the presence of the dimeric SNX9 species . All pyrene curves shown are representative of at least duplicate experiments . Microscopy - based actin polymerization assays were based on previous studies ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . NEM - treated rabbit muscle myosin was coated on acid - washed glass cov - erslips and mounted on a slide with two strips of double - sided tape spaced (cid:4) 0 . 5 cm apart . Actin assembly was initiated and then trans - ferredtotheslidechamber . Thecoverslipwas sealedandimmediately imaged by TIR - FM with 100 – 300 ms exposures , 5 s intervals using the microscope system described in Adams et al . ( 2004 ) . This micros - copy - based assay allows the detection and analysis of those F - actin structures captured on the coverslip and cannot be used to analyze bulk kinetics of the entire population of F - actin . Liposome Preparation / Binding Liposomes ( 100 mol % PC ; 15 mol % PI 4 , 5 P 2 + 85 mol % PC ; 15 mol % nickel NTA ( DOGS ) + 85 mol % PC [ Avanti ] ) were prepared as previ - ously described ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ) . Forliposome - binding experiments , 2 m Mproteinwasincubatedwith 400 m M liposomes for 45 min in liposome buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) and centrifuged for 20 min at 20 , 000 g . The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in an equal buffer volume . Equal volumes of supernatant and pellet samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . To observe liposome - induced SNX9 oligomerization , 2 . 0 m M SNX9 was incubated with 200 m M liposomes ( 400 nm ) or in liposome buffer alone for 30 min at room temperature . Samples were treated with 0 . 7 % Triton X - 100 ( 11 . 9 mM ) for 4 min and analyzed by 3 % – 8 % Tris - Acetate Native electrophoresis ( Invitrogen ) . Sucrose Gradient 150 m l of 6xHis - SNX9 was run on a 2 ml 5 % – 20 % sucrose gradient in control buffer at 50 k rpm for 8 hr at 4 (cid:3) C . 150 m l fractions were taken from the top of the tube and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Sedimentation was compared to standards : BSA ( 4 . 3 S ) , aldolase ( 7 . 35 S ) , catalase ( 11 . 3 S ) , and thyroglobulin ( 19 . 4 S ) .
