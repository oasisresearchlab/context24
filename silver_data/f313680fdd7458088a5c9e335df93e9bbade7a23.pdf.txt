Determining how 32 phosphorylation executes error correction requires an understanding of whether kinetochore 33 substrates are completely ( i . e . all - or - none ) or only fractionally phosphorylated . Using 34 quantitative mass spectrometry ( MS ) , we measured phospho - occupancy on the conserved 35 kinetochore protein Hec1 ( NDC80 ) that directly binds microtubules . None of the positions 36 measured exceeded ~ 50 % phospho - occupancy , and the cumulative phospho - occupancy changed 37 by only ~ 20 % in response to changes in microtubule attachment status . The narrow dynamic 38 range of phospho - occupancy is maintained by ongoing phosphatase activity . Further , both Cdk1 - 39 Cyclin B1 and Aurora kinases phosphorylate Hec1 to enhance error correction in response to 40 different types of microtubule attachment errors . Thus , networks of kinases and phosphatases 41 maintain low inherent phospho - occupancy to promote microtubule attachment to kinetochores 42 while providing for high sensitivity of kinetochore - microtubule attachments to very small 43 changes in phospho - occupancy to ensure high mitotic fidelity . 44 45 46 3 Introduction 47 The kinetochore is a complex protein structure that provides the link between 48 chromosomes and microtubules during mitosis 1 . Attachments between kinetochores and 49 microtubules are highly regulated in order to correct attachment errors that frequently occur in 50 early mitosis to prevent aneuploidy 2 – 6 . The Knl1 - Mis12 - NDC80 ( KMN ) complex has emerged 51 as a critical target for regulation at the kinetochore as this complex plays an essential role in 52 microtubule attachment 7 . The Aurora A and B kinases have been shown to promote error 53 correction through phosphorylation of these proteins , while the PP1 and PP2A - B56 phosphatases 54 have been shown to oppose these changes . Phosphorylation of the KMN network by these 55 kinases reduces their affinity for microtubules , enabling kinetochore - microtubule ( k - MT ) 56 detachment to promote error correction 5 , 7 – 11 . Therefore , it has been suggested that this network 57 “tunes” the phosphorylation state on kinetochores to precisely regulate the stability of k - MT 58 attachments 3 , 12 . However , there is currently no systems level understanding of how these kinases 59 and phosphatases coordinate to phosphorylate kinetochore substrates to provide this tuning of k - 60 MT stability . Current models suggest that phosphorylation acts as an all - or - none mechanism and 61 it remains unknown how the concerted actions of kinases and phosphatases generate the net ( sum 62 of kinase and phosphatase activities ) phosphorylation on specific sites in response to k - MT 63 attachment errors 4 , 13 . Although plausible , it seems improbable that kinetochore phosphorylation 64 operates through an all - or - none mechanism because saturation of phosphorylation sites on 65 kinetochore substrates would be anticipated to severely impair k - MT attachment , and conversely , 66 complete lack of phosphate would be anticipated to create hyper - stable k - MT attachments that 67 impede error correction . 68 4 Hec1 has an n - terminal tail comprising the first 70 amino acids that provides a primary 69 microtubule attachment site in kinetochores . It has been demonstrated that up to 9 sites among 70 this short sequence are phosphorylated in human cells , yet mutational analysis has revealed that 71 wild - type function can be provided by Hec1 possessing only 1 - 2 phosphorylation mimicking 72 sites 5 – 7 , 14 – 16 . Therefore , it is unclear how to reconcile the functional sufficiency provided by only 73 two phosphorylation sites with the evidence that nine sites serve as phosphoacceptors , and this 74 underscores our lack of understanding of the actual phosphorylation occupancy of these sites 75 during mitosis . Conceptually , the determination of post - translational modification site occupancy 76 is necessary to explain the mechanisms through which these modifications regulate biological 77 processes and , with respect to phosphorylation , to determine how kinase and phosphatase 78 networks create the net phospho - occupancy on specific sites to “tune” phosphorylation to affect 79 the stability of k - MT attachments . Despite the potential for mechanistic insight , occupancy 80 analysis is not yet routine and instead , differences in phosphorylation are routinely reported as 81 relative fold - change 17 . However , a 2 - fold change in relative phosphorylation could arise from a 82 change in absolute phospho - occupancy of either 1 % to 2 % or 50 % to 100 % , and these two 83 scenarios have different implications for how sensitive the system is for regulating the stability 84 of k - MT attachments . This issue cannot be resolved using site - specific amino acid substitution 85 because mutant proteins inherently adopt one extreme ( alanine mimics zero phosphorylation 86 occupancy ) or the other ( aspartic acid or glutamic acid mimic 100 % phosphorylation occupancy ) 87 relative to mimicking phosphorylation status . 88 To investigate the phosphorylation - dependent mechanisms that govern mitotic fidelity , 89 we selected the protein Hec1 as a candidate to measure phospho - occupancy because it is crucial 90 for microtubule binding at the k - MT interface and because previous models posit that 91 5 phosphorylation at multiple sites facilitates k - MT detachment to correct attachment errors 5 , 6 , 14 , 16 . 92 We determined that Hec1 is only partially phosphorylated , due to constant phosphatase activity , 93 at all sites queried under a variety of microtubule attachment conditions , and that only small 94 changes in phosphorylation occupancy are associated with changes in k - MT attachment status 95 including erroneous attachments . We also discovered that Cdk1 - Cyclin B1 plays a direct role in 96 k - MT error correction through phosphorylation of the Hec1 tail that is critical for accurate 97 chromosome segregation . Thus , the system of kinases and phosphatases operates to limit the 98 extent of phosphorylation to both allow for initial k - MT attachments and ensure efficient error 99 correction . 100 6 Results 101 Hec1 is phosphorylated at only partial occupancy during mitosis 102 To efficiently purify Hec1 , we created human cells expressing Hec1 fused to a 3XFLAG 103 tag using CRISPR / cas9 editing to insert the tag into the endogenous locus of Hec1 ( Figure S1A ) . 104 Addition of the tag did not perturb Hec1 function or mitotic progression as judged by Hec1 105 kinetochore localization , the lagging chromosome rate in anaphase , mitotic duration or binding 106 to the known Knl1 - Mis12 - NDC80 ( KNL ) complex member and Hec1 binding partner Nuf2 107 ( Figure S1B - F ) . 108 We purified Hec1 - 3XFLAG via immunoprecipitation ( Figure S2C ) and analyzed it by 109 mass spectrometry ( MS ) to determine phosphorylation site occupancy . Since it cannot be 110 assumed that a phospho - peptide and cognate non - phospho - peptide will be detected equally , we 111 monitored the change in abundance of non - phosphopeptide cognates with and without calf 112 intestinal phosphatase ( CIP ) treatment to dephosphorylate half of each sample by differential , 113 isotopically - encoded reductive dimethyl labeling . MS analysis confirmed that the CIP treatment 114 completely dephosphorylates peptides under these conditions ( Figure S2F ) . The untreated and 115 CIP - treated fractions are then remixed and analyzed by MS ( Figure 1A , S2D ) . Notably , this 116 approach cannot distinguish site - specific occupancies for peptides containing more than one 117 phosphorylated residue , and instead integrates their non - overlapping occupancies as a single 118 value . To explore if phosphorylation occupancy changes under different conditions of 119 microtubule attachment , we purified total Hec1 - 3XFLAG from mitotic cells lacking 120 microtubules ( 500 ng / ml nocodazole ( NOC ) ) , with mitotic spindle defects that create k - MT 121 attachment errors ( 100 ng / ml NOC or 25  M S - Trityl - L - cysteine ( STLC ) ) 18 , or with 122 predominantly correct bi - oriented k - MT attachments ( 25  M proTAME ) 19 ( Figure S2A , S2B ) . 123 7 We obtained sequence coverage and determined the phosphorylation occupancy of five 124 known phosphorylation sites within the n - terminal tail of Hec1 : S15 , S44 , T49 / S50 , S55 and S69 , 125 as well as the previously identified , but uncharacterized phosphorylation sites , T31 , S75 and S76 126 20 ( Figure 1B ) . We were unable to determine the occupancy of the known phosphorylation sites 127 S4 , S5 , S8 and S62 because their peptides are very hydrophilic and appeared only sporadically in 128 the MS data . The Aurora B phosphorylation site S15 and the Aurora A / B phosphorylation site 129 S55 were confidently localized on separate peptides for which occupancy could be determined . 130 Multiple peptides spanning the Aurora B phosphoacceptors S44 , T49 and S50 were identified as 131 singly phosphorylated at S44 and separately at either T49 or S50 , which could not be confidently 132 localized ; in such cases , it is reasonable to assume that either site could be phosphorylated , as 133 determined previously 20 – 22 . We did not observe any peptides doubly phosphorylated on S44 and 134 S49 / T50 . Furthermore , singly phosphorylated peptides containing the Aurora A and / or B 135 phosphoacceptors S69 , S75 and S76 were observed in which S69 phosphorylation was 136 unambiguously assigned on some peptides , as well as on either S75 or S76 , which has been 137 previously observed 20 . S75 / S76 phosphorylation has been shown to decrease under Aurora B 138 inhibition 20 , although the adjacent amino acid sequence is not characteristic of mitotic kinases 23 , 139 suggesting that it may be an atypical Aurora B consensus motif . Finally , we could determine 140 phospho - occupancy on a single peptide containing T31 , a site that is conserved and conforms to 141 a consensus sequence typical of Cdk1 phosphorylation sites 23 ( Figure 1C ) . 142 The direction and magnitude of the phospho - occupancy changes of each peptide among 143 the four conditions that we examined revealed three categories of response ( Figure 1B ) . One 144 category includes S44 / T49 / S50 and S69 / S75 / S76 , which displayed maximum occupancy in 145 mitotic cells without microtubule attachments ( 500 ng / ml NOC ) and with approximately 2 - fold 146 8 decrease of phospho - occupancy in each of the other conditions when microtubules are present 147 ( irrespective of the attachment configuration ) . Another category is defined by the peptides 148 containing S15 and T31 that are Aurora B and Cdk1 sites , respectively . These sites display 149 maximum phospho - occupancy under conditions that generate mostly erroneous k - MT 150 attachments ( STLC and 100 ng / ml NOC ) , and exceptionally low occupancy in cells with bi - 151 oriented k - MT attachments ( proTAME ) . A third category is defined by the peptide containing 152 S55 , which displayed switch - like behavior with maximum phosphorylation in the absence of 153 microtubules ( 500 ng / ml NOC ) and almost no phosphorylation in the other conditions . These 154 findings are broadly consistent with previous experiments showing that Hec1 phosphorylation is 155 lowest in mitotic cells with bi - oriented k - MT attachments 5 , but demonstrates that these sites 156 respond independently to different types of k - MT attachments . Furthermore , the phospho - 157 occupancy of individual sites does not uniformly correlate with inter - kinetochore distance that 158 has previously been proposed to influence the extent of Hec1 phosphorylation . For example , the 159 S15 and S44 / T49 / S50 sites have substantially different phospho - occupancies under conditions 160 with similar average inter - kinetochore distances ( 500 ng / ml vs 100 ng / ml NOC ) ( Figure 1B , 161 S2B ) . 162 Mutational and domain swapping experiments suggest that the Hec1 n - terminal tail 163 phosphorylation sites participate interchangeably in causing detachment of microtubules from 164 Hec1 8 . Therefore , the functional detachment of microtubules is likely sensitive to the cumulative 165 phosphorylation occupancy of all these sites , and our data can express the phospho - occupancies 166 within this domain as a cumulative score . The theoretical maximum cumulative occupancy for 167 the Hec1 peptides as measured by MS is 5 . 00 ( five peptides , each with 100 % occupancy ) . 168 Surprisingly , in any of the four conditions that we examined , with a range of k - MT attachments , 169 9 the cumulative phosphorylation of all peptides did not approach this maximum , and none of the 170 individual peptides that we sampled exceeded 50 % occupancy . The condition displaying the 171 highest total occupancy was mitotic cells treated with 500 ng / ml of NOC , which equalled 1 . 46 , 172 or approximately 29 . 2 % of theoretical maximum occupancy . Cells treated with STLC and 100 173 ng / ml NOC that have microtubule attachments , albeit mostly erroneous ones , displayed a 174 cumulative occupancy of 1 . 37 ( 27 . 4 % of theoretical maximum ) and 1 . 08 ( 21 . 6 % of theoretical 175 maximum ) , respectively . Cells under proTAME arrest displayed a cumulative occupancy of 0 . 46 176 ( 9 . 2 % of theoretical maximum ) . Similar trends were observed on Hec1 purified from soluble or 177 chromatin - associated cell fractions ( S2E ) , indicating that phospho - occupancy is not dependent 178 on specific protein subpopulations . Thus , the cumulative occupancy of these Hec1 peptides 179 changes by only 20 % ( from approximately 29 % to 9 % ) between mitotic cells with no k - MT 180 attachments and those with bi - oriented k - MT attachments . 181 Hec1 phosphorylation on T31 during mitosis is temporally regulated 182 To investigate how Hec1 phospho - occupancy is set by the competing activities of protein 183 kinases and phosphatases , we generated an antibody against phosphorylated T31 ( pT31 ) . We 184 focused our analysis on T31 as it is the only predicted Cdk1 site in the n - terminal tail of Hec1 185 and it is uncharacterized . We used immunofluorescence ( IF ) microscopy to validate its 186 specificity towards pT31 in mitotic cells and not to other phosphorylated sites within the Hec1 187 tail ( Figure S3A ) . Importantly , the relative pT31 intensity at kinetochores in imaged cells 188 paralleled the occupancy values determined using MS in that T31 is poorly phosphorylated in 189 cells arrested in 500 ng / ml NOC or proTAME , but robustly in cells arrested in 100 ng / ml NOC 190 or STLC ( Figure 1B , S3D , S3E ) . 191 10 To explore the functional role of T31 phosphorylation , we measured the pT31 intensity at 192 kinetochores in human cells as they underwent an unperturbed mitosis . We found that in both 193 HeLa and non - transformed RPE1 cells , there is little pT31 in prophase , the intensity sharply 194 increases in prometaphase and then declines in metaphase and anaphase ( Figure 2A , 2B , S3B , 195 S3C ) . We also measured the pT31 levels by IF in cells arrested under the same conditions that 196 we used for MS analysis . Since the cells were treated identically for both IF and MS , the 197 phospho - occupancy values determined by MS can be used to calibrate the fluorescence 198 intensities at kinetochores in cells progressing through mitosis . Specifically , the fluorescence 199 intensity at kinetochores in cells arrested in STLC would reflect approximately 33 % T31 200 phospho - occupancy . Using this calibration , the pT31 levels range from < 10 % ( prophase ) to ~ 40 % 201 ( late prometaphase ) ( Figure 2A , 2B ) . 202 Hec1 is phosphorylated on T31 by Cdk1 - Cyclin B1 complexes 203 Human cells enter mitosis with Cdk1 - Cyclin B1 and Cdk1 - Cyclin A2 complexes which 204 phosphorylate residues at the same consensus motif 23 . We therefore asked which of these 205 kinases phosphorylates Hec1 on T31 by siRNA mediated gene silencing . Strikingly , T31 206 phosphorylation was abolished at kinetochores of mitotic cells lacking either Cyclin A2 or 207 Cyclin B1 ( Figure 3A , 3B ) . However , we also observed the failure of Cyclin B1 - GFP to localize 208 to kinetochores in cells lacking Cyclin A2 ( Figure 3C ) . These results indicate that Cyclin A2 is 209 an upstream factor required for Cyclin B1 kinetochore localization and that Cdk1 - Cyclin B1 is 210 likely to be directly responsible for Hec1 T31 phosphorylation . 211 Next , we assessed the localization of Cyclins A2 and B1 relative to Hec1 and pT31 . 212 Consistently 24 – 27 , Cyclin A2 - GFP is cytosolic and does not obviously localize to kinetochores 213 ( Figure 4A , 4B ) , while Cyclin B1 - GFP localized to kinetochores , microtubules and spindle poles 214 11 in early through mid - prometaphase and then progressively disappeared as cells reached 215 metaphase . Kinetochore - localized Cyclin B1 - GFP largely co - localized with Hec1 and pT31 , 216 although it occupies a larger volume than Hec1 ( Figure 4C - E ) . 217 Hec1 T31 phosphorylation is increased on kinetochores with improper microtubule 218 attachments 219 The T31 location within the amino acid sequence of Hec1 and the temporal profile of 220 pT31 suggest a role for pT31 in k - MT attachment error correction . To explore this idea , we first 221 measured the pT31 intensity at laterally attached compared to end - on attached kinetochores 222 ( Figure 5A , 5B ) . This experiment revealed an approximately 2 - fold increase in pT31 at laterally 223 attached compared to end - on attached kinetochores . We then purposefully induced k - MT 224 attachment errors using the CENP - E inhibitor GSK - 923295 , which induces clustering of 225 chromosomes at the spindle poles and k - MT attachment errors through persistent monotelic 226 attachments 28 , 29 . This treatment induced an approximately 2 - fold increase in pT31 at pole - 227 arrested compared to aligned kinetochores ( Figure S5A , S5B ) . As an additional but different 228 means of inducing errors in k - MT attachments , we utilized a mutant of Hec1 ( Hec1 8A ) 6 , 30 229 ( Figure S7A ) which prevents complete chromosome alignment through hyperstable k - MT 230 attachments that cannot be corrected . In cells expressing Hec1 8A , a majority of chromosomes 231 eventually align with bi - orientated attachments , but some remain unaligned ( Figure S5C ) . Inter - 232 kinetochore distance measurements confirm hyperstabilization of k - MT attachments in mitotic 233 cells expressing Hec1 8A ( Figure S7B ) 5 , 14 , 31 , 32 . In these cells , pT31 levels were also elevated in 234 pole - arrested compared to aligned kinetochores ( Figure S5C , S5D ) . Taken together , these data 235 show increased phospho - occupancy at T31 on improper lateral and monotelic attachment 236 configurations compared to end - on k - MT attachments . 237 12 To test if Cyclin B1 specifically localizes to kinetochores with improper k - MT 238 attachments , we treated cells with GSK - 923295 to generate k - MT attachment errors . We 239 frequently observed pole - arrested kinetochores with lateral monotelic attachments where only 240 the attached kinetochore showed Cyclin B1 present . We also observed kinetochores with lateral 241 syntelic attachments with Cyclin B1 present on both sister kinetochores . We did not observe any 242 Cyclin B1 on kinetochores with end - on amphitelic attachments ( Figure S5E , S5F ) . Furthermore , 243 the intensity of Cyclin B1 - GFP at kinetochores was high in mitotic cells arrested with 100 ng / ml 244 NOC or STLC , and low in cells arrested with 500 ng / ml NOC or proTAME ( Figure S4A , S4B ) , 245 a pattern similar to pT31 levels in cells arrested under those conditions ( Figure S3D , S3E ) . Thus , 246 Cyclin B1 localization is enriched on improper k - MT attachments coinciding with increased 247 Hec1 pT31 . 248 Persistent errors in k - MT attachment manifest as chromosomes lagging in anaphase and 249 increase chromosome mis - segregation 33 . To test if Hec1 T31 phosphorylation participates in 250 error correction , we expressed Hec1 - GFP in which T31 was mutated to either alanine ( T31A ) or 251 aspartic acid ( T31D ) . For comparison , we also generated S15A and S15D mutants because S15 252 is phosphorylated by a different kinase ( Aurora B ) and it demonstrated a similar occupancy 253 profile as T31 ( Figure 1B , S2E ) . Hec1 T31A expression resulted in elevated lagging 254 chromosome rates in asynchronous cells ( Figure 5C , 5D ) . Hec1 T31D expression showed no 255 change relative to wild - type Hec1 , suggesting that this substitution may not have a functional 256 effect . Next , we increased k - MT attachment errors via treatment of cells with an STLC washout 257 strategy and measured the lagging chromosome frequency . As expected , the overall lagging 258 chromosome rate was elevated in all cases . Hec1 T31A expression resulted in very high lagging 259 chromosome rates in cells recovering from STLC treatment , suggesting that Hec1 T31 260 13 phosphorylation is required for efficient k - MT attachment error correction ( Figure 5E ) . 261 Interestingly , Hec1 S15A or S15D expression had no significant effect on lagging chromosomes 262 rates in either asynchronous cells or cells recovering from STLC treatment ( Figure 5C - E ) , 263 suggesting perhaps that Aurora kinases can compensate for the absence of one phosphorylation 264 site by increasing phosphorylation at other sites . These data demonstrate that Hec1 T31 265 phosphorylation by Cdk1 - Cyclin B1 is important for efficient k - MT attachment error correction 266 and that pT31 provides a greater contribution to error correction than Hec1 S15 phosphorylation 267 by Aurora B . 268 Kinetochore Hec1 phosphorylation levels are determined by phosphatase activity 269 To determine the phosphatase contribution to the net phospho - occupancy of the Cdk1 - 270 Cyclin B1 site T31 , we arrested cells in mitosis with 100 or 500 ng / ml NOC and then treated the 271 cells with the general phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( OA ; 200 nM ) for 2 hours prior to 272 fixation . In both conditions , the pT31 intensity at kinetochores increased in the presence of 273 okadaic acid , but not to saturation ( Figure 6A , 6B ) . This occurred in spite of poor localization of 274 Cyclin B1 to kinetochores lacking microtubule attachments ( 500 ng / ml NOC ) suggesting that 275 even partial localization of Cyclin B1 is sufficient to elevate Hec1 phospho - occupancy under 276 these conditions . We also tested the contribution of phosphatases to the levels of pS44 in cells 277 under the same conditions . Interestingly , the extent of phosphorylation was markedly increased 278 in cells treated with the high dose of nocodazole , but only to a lesser extent in cells treated 279 arrested in the lower dose ( Figure 6C , 6D ) . These data show that the phospho - occupancy of 280 Aurora and Cdk1 substrates are differentially regulated . We also noticed in these experiments 281 that in cells treated with 100 ng / ml NOC the kinetochores were clustered around and attached to 282 centrosomes with short microtubule stub - spindles ( Figure 6A , 6C , S2A , S3D , S4A ) . However , 283 14 following treatment with OA , the kinetochores were distributed throughout the cytoplasm , 284 suggesting that the kinetochores had detached from the microtubules . To determine if this was 285 the case , we stained identically treated cells for  tubulin and examined the extent of kinetochore 286 attachment . This experiment confirmed that in cells treated with nocodazole only , all 287 chromosomes were attached to the stub spindles by at least one kinetochore . However , in cells 288 treated with both nocodazole and OA almost all kinetochores were detached from the spindles 289 ( Figure 6E ) , suggesting that Hec1 phosphorylation levels are repressed by phosphatases to 290 prevent k - MT detachment despite ongoing kinase activity . Given that only a modest 1 . 3 - fold 291 increase in phosphorylation was observed at S44 in cells treated with OA , k - MT attachments are 292 likely very sensitive to phosphorylation levels . 293 K - MT attachments have previously been shown to be regulated during prometaphase by 294 the PP2A - B56 family of phosphatases 10 , 11 . To determine if Hec1 tail phosphorylation is 295 regulated by PP2A - B56 , we took advantage of the fact that kinetochore isoforms of B56 are 296 recruited to the kinetochore by the protein BubR1 11 . Therefore , knockdown of BubR1 removes 297 them from the kinetochore . We silenced expression of BubR1 using siRNA mediated 298 knockdown ( Figure S6K ) and examined the phosphorylation state of Hec1 . Interestingly , we 299 observed an approximately 1 . 2 - fold increase in phosphorylation of both S44 and T31 positions 300 on Hec1 ( Figure S6A - D ) , which suggests that Hec1 phosphorylation by both Aurora and Cdk1 301 kinases are repressed by the PP2A - B56 group of phosphatases and is consistent with previous 302 findings 10 , 11 . In these experiments we also observed a large proportion of the BubR1 knockdown 303 cells that displayed chromosome alignment defects ( Figure S6A , S6C , S6E , S6I ) as reported 304 previously 11 . Since it had been previously determined that the alignment defects are due to a loss 305 of k - MT detachment as a result of increased KMN network protein phosphorylation 10 , 11 , we also 306 15 examined the stability of MTs using a cold MT stability assay under these conditions . Despite an 307 only 1 . 2 - fold increase in phosphorylation at S44 and T31 on Hec1 , this experiment revealed a 308 0 . 4 - fold loss of MTs ( Figure S6E , S6F ) , again suggesting that the k - MT attachment state is 309 hypersensitive to KMN network protein phosphorylation . 310 To confirm that Hec1 phosphorylation is repressed by PP2A - B56 , we silenced the 311 expression of the B56 subunit isoforms using a previously described pool of siRNAs 10 ( Figure 312 S6L ) and examined the phosphorylation state of Hec1 at S44 and T31 . This experiment showed a 313 1 . 6 - fold increase in pS44 levels ( Figure 7A , 7B ) . Interestingly , under the same conditions we 314 observed a slight decrease in pT31 levels ( Figure 7C , 7D ) , although we continued to observe 315 increased phosphorylation at pole - arrested kinetochores compared to aligned kinetochores 316 ( Figure 7C ) . This might indicate additional OA - sensitive phosphatases acting to regulate the 317 phospho - occupancy of the T31 site . Consistent with previous findings 10 , we also observed that 318 cells with B56 knockdown display moderate to severe chromosome alignment defects ( Figure 319 7A , 7C , 7E , S6G ) . To test if the defects in chromosome alignment are due to a loss of K - MT 320 attachment stability , we again performed a cold MT stability assay in cells with B56 knockdown 321 compared to controls . This experiment revealed that cells with B56 knockdown have only 35 % 322 of the cold - stable microtubule fluorescence compared to control cells , which likely explains the 323 defects in chromosome alignment . As we and others have noted previously , the presence of 324 ( improper ) k - MT attachments is required both for Cyclin B1 localization to kinetochores and for 325 robust phosphorylation of T31 ( Figure S4 ) 26 , 27 . We therefore examined if kinetochores have 326 such weak attachments under conditions of total phosphatase loss that Cdk1 - Cyclin B1 is unable 327 to efficiently localize to and phosphorylate Hec1 under conditions of phosphatase loss at 328 kinetochores . We compared the localization pattern of Cyclin B1 - GFP during prometaphase 329 16 under conditions of BubR1 knockdown and also B56 knockdown . Interestingly , most cells with 330 BubR1 knockdown maintained Cyclin B1 localization at kinetochores , as did cells with B56 331 knockdown and moderate chromosome alignment defects . However , most cells with B56 332 knockdown and severe alignment defects did not have Cyclin B1 at kinetochores ( Figure S6G - J ) . 333 This suggests that Cyclin B1 might only localize to kinetochores that are strongly bound to 334 microtubules in order to destabilize them , whereas it would not further destabilize attachments 335 that are already weak . 336 The Aurora and Cdk1 phosphorylation networks respond differentially to stimuli 337 We next sought to compare how the Aurora B and CDK1 signaling networks respond to 338 alterations in k - MT stability . We used the Hec1 8A and 8D mutants ( Figure S7A ) because they 339 preserve an Aurora B site ( S44 ) and the Cdk1 site ( T31 ) , allowing us to monitor the 340 phosphorylation status of these two specific sites in cells with k - MT attachment errors . We 341 observed a significant increase in pS44 levels at kinetochores in early and late prometaphase 342 cells expressing Hec1 8A compared to wild - type Hec1 . We also observed a slight increase in 343 pS44 levels in late prometaphase cells expressing the 8D mutant ( Figure S7C , S7E ) . In contrast , 344 there was a significant decrease in pT31 levels in early prometaphase cells expressing Hec1 8A 345 ( Figure S7D , S7F ) . Since this Hec1 mutant promotes the formation of precocious end - on k - MT 346 attachments in early prometaphase 32 , this is consistent with our results showing decreased pT31 347 at end - on attached kinetochores ( Figure 5A , 5B ) . There was no overall significant change in 348 pT31 levels in late prometaphase Hec1 8A expressing cells ( although we observe increased 349 phosphorylation at pole - arrested kinetochores ) , suggesting a temporal change in Cdk1 or 350 phosphatase activity for site T31 under these conditions . Notably , we observed a slight decrease 351 in pT31 levels in cells expressing the 8D mutant in both early and late prometaphase cells 352 17 ( Figure S7D , S7F ) which is consistent with our data showing that phosphatase inhibition reduces 353 pT31 levels due to a loss of k - MT attachment and Cyclin B1 localization at kinetochores ( Figure 354 7 , S6G , S6H ) . Thus , the Aurora B and Cdk1 signaling networks respond independently to 355 changes in the nature of k - MT attachments , which is consistent with our phospho - occupancy 356 measurements determined by MS ( Figure 1B ) . 357 358 18 Discussion 359 Taken together , our data demonstrate that phosphorylation of the population of Hec1 360 molecules that form an essential component of the kinetochore - microtubule attachment interface 361 does not follow an all - or - none mechanism despite the fact that phosphorylation of individual 362 amino acids on individual molecules is binary ( i . e . , phosphorylated or not ) . Importantly , the 363 phosphorylation occupancy that we measured on multiple sites on Hec1 was similar between the 364 soluble and insoluble ( e . g . , predominantly chromatin bound ) populations of Hec1 in mitotic cells . 365 Moreover , we observed partial phosphorylation occupancy on multiple sites of Hec1 in mitotic 366 cells treated with high doses of nocodazole , conditions where all kinetochores lack any 367 microtubule attachments and are in an equivalent state . Thus , fractional phospho - occupancy 368 reflects equal distribution of the phosphorylated Hec1 amongst the total population of Hec1 369 molecules at the time of assessment as opposed to reflecting different sub - populations of Hec1 370 molecules where phospho - occupancy depends on the nature of the sub - population . In other 371 words , in a case where a specific site demonstrates 25 % phospho - occupancy , our data indicates 372 that 25 % of all Hec1 molecules are phosphorylated rather than specific sub - populations of Hec1 373 molecules where one sub - population is comprised of 25 % of Hec1 molecules that are 100 % 374 phospho - occupied at that site and another sub - population that is comprised of 75 % of Hec1 375 molecules that are 0 % phospho - occupied at that site . 376 These findings carry numerous implications for how phosphorylation regulates 377 kinetochore - microtubule attachments at the binding interface to both favor efficient microtubule 378 capture by kinetochores and to support robust error correction to ensure high mitotic fidelity 379 ( Figure 7G ) . First , these data underscore the principle that net phosphorylation occupancy of any 380 specific site on a protein is determined by ongoing activities of both kinases and phosphatases , 381 19 and illustrates the essential role for ongoing protein phosphatase activity in regulating k - MT 382 attachments . Specifically , some models predict that phospho - occupancy of proteins like Hec1 at 383 the kinetochore - microtubule interface would be nearly fully saturated under conditions where 384 kinetochores lack microtubule attachments and / or possess improperly oriented microtubule 385 attachments 4 , 13 , 34 . However , we demonstrate that in mitotic cells treated with low dose 386 nocodazole which induces the formation of stub - spindles replete with erroneous k - MT 387 attachments lacking tension that ongoing phosphatase activity limits the extent of Hec1 388 phosphorylation ( Fig 6 ) . This ongoing phosphatase activity is essential to bias kinetochores to 389 remain attached to the stub spindles because chromosomes detach from the stub - spindles upon 390 phosphatase inhibition . Indeed , even when kinetochores completely lack microtubule 391 attachments induced by treatment of mitotic cells with high dose nocodazole the ongoing 392 phosphatase activity maintains a relatively low level of Hec1 phospho - occupancy ( Figure 1B , 393 Figure 6A - D , Figure S2E ) . In support of this idea , it has been shown that mitotic cells in which 394 phosphatases have been inactivated are unable to properly congress chromosomes to the 395 metaphase plate 10 , 11 . 396 These observations resolve a previously described paradox 13 , 34 – 36 that explicitly 397 predicted high kinetochore phospho - occupancy in the absence of microtubule attachments . 398 Resolving this paradox is particularly important to illuminate how conditions favor initial k - MT 399 attachments at the prophase to prometaphase transition . At the time of nuclear envelope 400 breakdown , kinetochores lack microtubule attachments . If kinase activity were unconstrained 401 toward substrates on unattached kinetochores , then complete phosphorylation of sites at the 402 prophase to prometaphase transition would substantially disfavor the formation of initial 403 20 microtubule attachments . Our data highlights the importance of ongoing phosphatase activity to 404 dampen kinetochore substrate phosphorylation in order to favor initial microtubule attachments . 405 We also provide the first direct evidence that Cdk1 - Cyclin B1 plays an active role in 406 promoting k - MT attachment error correction , and that Cdk1 - mediated error correction is 407 independent from the established role of Aurora kinase . Our data show that these two enzymes 408 recognize different types of k - MT attachment errors with Cdk1 focused on conversion of 409 sidewall to end - on attachments and Aurora focused k - MT attachments with improper tension . 410 Consistently , sites phosphorylated by these enzymes show opposing changes in phospho - 411 occupancy in response to the same stimulus ( Figure S7E , S7F ) . This supports the view that 412 different types of k - MT attachment errors rely on different mechanisms of detection and / or 413 response to catalyze their correction . Perhaps it is surprising that these two kinases , that are 414 responding to different types of k - MT attachment defects , phosphorylate closely located sites on 415 the same peptide of Hec1 . However , it is important to emphasize that the functional output of 416 these kinases is not expected to be limited to changes in phosphorylation of only Hec1 at 417 kinetochores . 418 This new role of Cdk1 - Cyclin B1 in error correction fits within a feed - forward 419 mechanism of mitotic control whereby Cdk1 - Cyclin B1 targeting to kinetochores through Mad1 420 25 , 37 , 38 regulates cell cycle timing through satisfaction of the spindle assembly checkpoint and 421 also ensures efficient correction of erroneous k - MT attachments . Notably , the targeting of Cdk1 - 422 Cyclin B1 to kinetochores with attachment errors in early mitosis depends on Cdk1 - Cyclin A2 . 423 Previously , we demonstrated that Cdk1 - Cyclin A2 activity destabilizes k - MT attachment 424 stability coordinately on kinetochores of all chromosomes to promote error correction in 425 prometaphase 24 which reinforces this feed - forward mechanism involving cell cycle timing with 426 21 k - MT attachment error correction . The data presented here provides further molecular insight 427 into how a distributive system that regulates all kinetochores coordinately through Cdk1 - Cyclin 428 A2 forms direct mechanistic links to regulatory molecules that operate chromosome - 429 autonomously ( Cyclin B1 & MYPT1 / Plk1 ) 39 . 430 Finally , no site on Hec1 that we measured exceeded 50 % phospho - occupancy under any 431 condition that we tested and the cumulative phospho - occupancy among the sites measured 432 changed by only 20 % in response to the full spectrum of microtubule attachment status from 433 unattached , to predominantly erroneous attachments , to predominantly end - on attachment . These 434 data indicate that the correction of microtubule attachment errors responds to very small changes 435 in phosphorylation , at least with respect to the phospho - occupancy of Hec1 . As a mechanism of 436 control , this indicates that phosphorylation displays properties of high sensitivity at the 437 kinetochore - microtubule binding interface because small changes in phosphorylation are 438 associated with substantial changes ( i . e . detachment ) in microtubule attachment status . In this 439 context , the system appears strongly biased to maintaining inherently low phospho - occupancy 440 which is important to both promote initial microtubule attachments and microtubule re - 441 attachment following a detachment event related to the correction of an improperly oriented 442 microtubule . Our data provide direct biochemical evidence for results based on amino acid 443 substitution mutants indicating that 1 - 2 phosphates per Hec1 molecule are sufficient to 444 recapitulate normal kinetochore / chromosome behavior , and that kinetochore behavior is most 445 sensitive between 0 - 4 phosphates 6 . An important distinction , however , is that we demonstrate 446 that Hec1 molecules are phosphorylated at partial phospho - occupancy over several sites , rather 447 than an all - or - none phospho - occupancy at 1 - 2 sites . Tangibly , stoichiometric assessments show 448 that single microtubule ends are surrounded by eight Hec1 molecules at kinetochores 40 , and our 449 22 data indicates that phosphorylation of as few as three of the eight molecules of Hec1 surrounding 450 a given microtubule ( 37 . 5 % phospho - occupancy ) would be sufficient to favor detachment of that 451 microtubule from the kinetochore . 452 453 23 Methods 454 Cell Culture 455 HeLa cells ( CCL - 2 ) and RPE1 ( CRL - 4000 ) were obtained from the ATCC . All cells were grown 456 at 37 o C in a humidified environment with 5 % CO 2 . The unmodified cell lines were grown in 457 Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( Corning  # 15 - 017 - CM ) containing 10 % FCS ( Hyclone 458 # 82013 - 586 ) , 250μg / L Amphotericin B ( VWR # 82026 - 728 ) , 50 U / mL penicillin and 50 μg / mL 459 streptomycin ( ThermoFisher Scientific # 15140122 ) . Doxycycline inducible Hec1 knockout 460 HeLa cells ( gift of Iain Cheeseman ) were grown in media containing 10 % tetracycline - free FBS 461 ( Denville Scientific # 1005807 ) , the same antibiotics as for unmodified cells , 500  g / ml G418 462 ( Invivogen # ant - gn - 5 ) and 5  g / ml puromycin ( ThermoFisher Scientific # A1113803 ) . HeLa 463 Cyclin B1 - GFP cells were grown in media containing 4  g / ml blasticidin ( Invivogen # ant - bl - 05 ) . 464 HeLa Cyclin A2 - GFP cells 25 were grown in media containing 9  g / ml blasticidin ( gifts of 465 Francis Barr ) . Cells were verified to be free of mycoplasma by frequent staining of plated cells 466 with DAPI . No contamination was observed . 467 Inhibitors and reagents 468 The CENP - E inhibitor GSK - 923295 ( MedChemExpress LLC # HY - 10299 ) was used at 200 nM . 469 NOC ( VWR # 80058 - 500 ) was used at 100 - 500 ng / ml . STLC ( Tocris # 2191 ) was used at 25  M . 470 ProTAME ( Concept Life Sciences custom synthesis ) was used at 25  M . Okadaic acid ( LC Labs 471 O - 5857 ) was used at 200 nM . Doxycycline hyclate ( Sigma - Aldrich # 24390 - 14 - 5 ) was used at 2 472  g / ml . 473 Plasmids and cloning 474 pFETCh _ Donor ( EMM0021 ) was a gift from Eric Mendenhall & Richard M . Myers ( Addgene 475 plasmid # 63934 ) . pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP ( PX458 ) was a gift from Feng Zhang ( Addgene 476 24 plasmid # 48138 ) . The Hec1 - GFP Wt and 9A mutant plasmids were a gift of Jennifer DeLuca . 477 Additional mutations were generated via site - directed mutagenesis using the following primers : 478 S44 Wt / 8A FD : 5’ - 479 GAGAAACCAACCTTTGGAAAGTTGAGTATAAACAAACCGGCCTCTGAAAGA - 3’ 480 RV : 5’ - TCTTTCAGAGGCCGGTTTGTTTATACTCAACTTTCCAAAGGTTGGTTTCTC - 3’ 481 T31A FD : 5’ - AAACAAGGCCTCTATGCCCCTCAAACCAAAGAGAAACC - 3’ 482 RV : 5’ - GGTTTCTCTTTGGTTTGAGGGGCATAGAGGCCTTGTTT - 3’ 483 T31D FD : 5’ - AAACAAGGCCTCTATGACCCTCAAACCAAAGAGAAACC - 3’ 484 RV : 5’ - GGTTTCTCTTTGGTTTGAGGGTCATAGAGGCCTTGTTT - 3’ 485 S15A FD : 5’ - GGTGCTGGCCGCCTCGCCATGCAGGAGTTAAGATCC - 3’ 486 RV : 5’ - GGATCTTAACTCCTGCATGGCGAGGCGGCCAGCACC - 3’ 487 S15D FD : 5’ - GGTGCTGGCCGCCTCGACATGCAGGAGTTAAGATCC - 3’ 488 RV : 5’ - GGATCTTAACTCCTGCATGTCGAGGCGGCCAGCACC - 3’ 489 The DNA constructs were then verified by sequencing and amplified by maxiprep ( Qiagen 490 # 12162 ) 491 Transfections 492 100 , 000 HeLa inducible Hec1 knockout cells were plated on glass coverslips in 12 - well plates . 493 24 hours following plating , they were transfected with 1  g plasmid DNA and 2 . 5  l 494 Lipofectamine TM 2000 ( ThermoFisher # 11668027 ) in a total of 1 ml Opti - MEM TM media 495 ( ThermoFisher # 31985070 ) . Four hours following transfection , the media was changed for 496 DMEM containing doxycycline , puromycin and G418 . The cells were then assayed 48 - 72 hours 497 following transfection . 498 Mitotic error rate 499 25 100 , 000 HeLa inducible Hec1 knockout cells were plated on glass coverslips in 12 - well plates . 500 For determination of the error rate in asynchronous cells , the cells were fixed 72 hours after 501 transfection , stained with DAPI and then analyzed . For determination of the error rate from 502 STLC washout , the cells were transfected as described above , allowed to recover for 24 hours 503 and then synchronized by thymidine addition for 24 hours . The cells were then released into 504 media containing STLC for 14 hours . The cells were then released from STLC by two PBS 505 washes and then fresh medium for 2 . 5 hours before the cells were fixed . 506 CRISPR / Cas9 genomic editing 507 We employed a strategy described previously 41 to tag Hec1 at the endogenous locus ( NCBI 508 Reference Sequence : NC _ 000018 . 10 ) . HeLa cell genomic DNA was purified using a kit ( Qiagen 509 # 69504 ) . The homology arms were then amplified by PCR using NEB Phusion  polymerase 510 ( # M0530S ) using the following primers : 511 Hom1 FD : 5’ - TCCCCGACCTGCAGCCCAGCTGATAAATACGAAGGTGAAAACCAGG - 3’ 512 Hom1 RV : 5’ - CCGGAACCTCCTCCGCTCCCTTCTTCAGAAGACTTAATTAGAG - 3’ 513 Hom2 FD : 5’ - AGTTCTTCTGATTCGAACATCGAATAAAATTGTCTCAGTAAAGTG - 3’ 514 Hom2 RV : 5’ - TGGAGAGGACTTTCCAAGGGATTTGGCTCACATGATGTAGG - 3’ 515 A donor plasmid was then created via Gibson assembly according to the manufacturer protocol 516 ( New England Biolabs # E2611S ) . Separately , a vector expressing the gRNA and cas9 was 517 created as previously described 42 using the following DNA fragments : 518 5’ - CACCGTGAGACAATTTTATTCACTA - 3’ 519 5’ - AAACTAGTGAATAAAATTGTCTCAC - 3’ 520 The DNA constructs were then verified by sequencing and amplified by maxiprep . 200 , 000 521 HeLa cells were then plated on a 6 - well plate . 24 hours later they were transfected with 2  g 522 26 donor plasmid , 1  g gRNA / cas9 plasmid and 7 . 5  l lipofectamine TM 2000 in 2 ml opti - MEM TM 523 media . Four hours Following transfection , the media was changed for DMEM . 24 hours later , 524 G418 was added to select for successfully edited cells . Once the cells reached colonies of 50 - 100 525 cells , they were trypsinized and plated on 96 - well plates at a density of 0 . 5 cells per well . Single - 526 cell clones were then amplified and tested for expression of the edited gene via IF and Western 527 blot . 528 Purification of Hec1 - 3XFLAG 529 HeLa Hec1 - 3XFLAG cells were expanded to 16 15 cm dishes . When they reached 70 - 80 % 530 confluency , Thymidine ( Sigma - Aldrich # T1895 - 5G ) was added to a concentration of 2 . 5 mM . 531 After 24 hours , the cells were washed twice with PBS and released into NOC or STLC . The cells 532 were then harvested 14 hours after release . For proTAME synchronization , the cells were 533 released from thymidine as above , but the drug was added 8 hours later for a further 4 hours 534 before harvesting . Mitotic cells were then harvested by washing the detached and semi - detached 535 cells off the plate by pipetting . The cells were then washed with PBS and then divided 60 % - 40 % 536 for subcellular fractionation and total protein purification , respectively . Cells used for total 537 protein purification were lysed with 2 ml of a buffer containing 1 % Sodium dodecyl sulfate 538 ( SDS ; Sigma - Aldrich # 436143 ) , 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 1mM EDTA . The cells were then crudely 539 homogenized using a 5 ml syringe and 18 g needle . The lysate was then immediately boiled for 5 540 minutes . After cooling , the DNA was sheared using a syringe until the viscosity was acceptably 541 reduced in a 15 ml tube using a 5ml syringe and 18g needle . The SDS was sequestered via 542 addition of 13 ml extraction buffer ( 3 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich # T8787 ) , 50 mM Tris pH 543 7 . 5 , 250 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA ) and cooled on ice . Concurrently , subcellular fractionation was 544 performed on the remaining cells by suspending them in 10 ml cold hypotonic buffer ( 10 mM 545 27 Tris pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM glycerol 2 - phosphate ( Sigma - Aldrich # G9422 ) , 546 1 mM EDTA ) on ice , followed by douncing every 5 minutes . After 20 minutes , the mixture was 547 aliquoted into 1 . 5 ml tubes and centrifuged at 4 o C at maximum speed for 20 minutes . The 548 supernatant containing soluble protein was then removed , SDS added to a concentration of 0 . 2 % 549 and boiled for 5 minutes . After cooling to room temperature , 5 ml of 3X extraction buffer was 550 added to the soluble fraction , which was set aside on ice . The chromatin containing pellets were 551 crudely homogenized via syringe in 2 ml SDS lysis buffer and boiled for 5 minutes . The DNA 552 was then sheared via syringe in a 15 ml tube . The SDS was then sequestered by adding 13 ml 553 extraction buffer and cooled on ice . All 3 fractions were then centrifuged at maximum speed in a 554 benchtop centrifuged to remove any remaining cell debris from the lysates . 30  l of packed M2 555 anti - FLAG affinity gel ( Sigma - Aldrich # A2220 - 5ML ) was then added to the lysates , which were 556 then incubated overnight on a rotating platform at 4 o C . The affinity gel was then transferred to a 557 1 . 5 ml tube and washed twice with extraction buffer . The volume of extraction buffer was then 558 reduced to 30  l , and 70  l water and 1mM MnCl 2 added together with 1  l DNaseI ( NEB 559 # M0303S ) for 10 minutes at room temperature in order to degrade any DNA that precipitated 560 overnight . Any separable debris was aspirated using a 30g needle . The affinity gel was then 561 washed an additional 3 times with cold extraction buffer , incubating for 10 minutes between 562 each wash . The gel was then dried using a 30 g needle connected to a vacuum line . To elute the 563 purified protein , the affinity gel was suspended in elution buffer ( 2 % SDS , 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 564 50 mM NaCl , 20 % glycerol , 2 mM dithiothreitol ( Sigma - Aldrich # D0632 - 5G ; fresh ) and 565 incubated at 65 o C for 20 minutes . The samples were then cooled to room temperature . 566 Iodoacetamide ( Sigma - Aldrich # I6125 - 5G ) was added to a concentration of 6mM , vortexed and 567 the samples incubated in the dark for 1 hour . Then , an additional 2mM dithiothreitol was added 568 28 and incubated for 15 minutes . The samples were then run on 8 % SDS - PAGE gel and stained 569 with Coomassie blue . The gels were imaged with a Gel Doc TM Ez ( Bio - Rad # 1708270 ) . 570 SDS - PAGE and Western blot 571 Gels and blots were performed as described previously 43 . 572 Mass spectrometry 573 Gel bands were excised , destained to clarity , digested using trypsin ( Promega # V5113 ) and the 574 resulting peptides were extracted as described previously 44 . Each sample was desalted by 575 STAGE tip 45 and then dried by vacuum centrifugation . Samples were resuspended in 220  l of 576 buffer ( 100mM TEAB ( Sigma - Aldrich # 17902 ) , 10mM MgCl 2 , and 100mM NaCl ) by vortexing 577 and split into pairs of 100  l each . One of each pair was treated with 0 . 5  l of calf intestinal 578 phosphatase ( CIP ) ( New England Biolabs # M0290 ) before the pair were incubated at 37°C for 1 579 hour . Since the Aurora kinases phosphorylate proteins adjacent to lysine and arginine residues , 580 which also represent trypsin cleavage sites , both CIP - treated and untreated samples were then re - 581 digested with an additional 0 . 1  g trypsin overnight at 37°C to prevent missed cleavages due to 582 protein phosphorylation . The CIP - treated and untreated samples were then labeled by heavy and 583 light reductive dimethyl labeling respectively , as previously described 46 , 47 ( Sigma - Aldrich 584 # 252549 , # 156159 , # 190090 , Cambridge Isotope Laboratories # CDLM - 4599 - 1 ) . After labeling , 585 the heavy and light pair were mixed , desalted together by STAGE tip , and dried by vacuum 586 centrifugation . Dried samples were resuspended in 5 % Methanol ( Sigma - Aldrich # 34860 ) / 1 . 5 % 587 Formic Acid ( Honeywell # 64 - 18 - 6 ) and analyzed by online microcapillary liquid 588 chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry using either a ThermoFisher Scientific QE + , 589 Orbitrap Fusion , or an Orbitrap Lumos nLC - MS / MS platform as previously described 48 . The 590 mass spectra were searched using the COMET search algorithm 49 to generate peptide spectral 591 29 matches as previously described for dimethyl labeled samples 47 . Peptide spectral matches were 592 filtered to a ~ 1 % FDR using the target - decoy strategy 50 and reported . Peptide masses and 593 retention times were then used to manually quantify the extracted ion chromatograms of 594 unphosphorylated heavy and light labeled pairs in all runs using Xcalibur Qual Browser software 595 ( ThermoFisher ) . Phosphorylation occupancy was calculated for candidate sites using these areas 596 as described previously 51 . 597 RNA interference 598 Gene knockdown was performed as described previously 43 with the following siRNAs 599 purchased from Sigma - Aldrich : 600 Cyclin B1 : 5’ - GACCAUGUACAUGACUGUCUC [ dT ] [ dT ] - 3’ 601 Cyclin A2 : 5’ - UAUACCCUGGAAAGUCU [ dT ] [ dT ] - 3’ 602 BubR1 : 5’ - AAAGAUCCUGGCUAACUGUUC [ dT ] [ dT ] - 3’ 603 B56 Alpha : 5’ - UGAAUGAACUGGUUGAGUA [ dT ] [ dT ] - 3’ 604 B56 Beta : 5’ - GAACAAUGAGUAUAUCCUA [ dT ] [ dT ] - 3’ 605 B56 Gamma : 5’ - GGAAGAUGAACCAACGUUA [ dT ] [ dT ] - 3’ 606 B56 Delta : 5’ - UGACUGAGCCGGUAAUUGU [ dT ] [ dT ] - 3’ 607 B56 Epsilon : 5’ - GCACAGCUGGCAUAUUGUA [ dT ] [ dT ] - 3’ 608 NSC 5’ - AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU [ dT ] [ dT ] - 3’ 609 Immunofluorescence 610 Following treatments , cells were fixed in methanol at - 20 o C except for experiments using GFP 611 constructs , cold stable MT assays and those involving Cyclins A2 or B1 , which were fixed with 612 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature . Cells were pre - extracted in 613 PHEM buffer ( 60 mM PIPES , 25 mM HEPES , pH 6 . 9 , 10 mM EGTA , and 4 mM MgSO 4 , 1 % 614 30 Triton X - 100 , 10 mM glycerol 2 - phosphate ) for 10 minutes at 4 o C . The remaining steps were 615 performed at room temperature . Experiments involving Cyclin A2 or Cyclin B1 were not pre - 616 extracted and instead were permeabilized post - fixation with PHEM buffer for 10 minutes . The 617 cells were then re - hydrated in PBS for 10 minutes before blocking with TrueBlack  IF blocking 618 buffer ( Biotium # 23012B ) for 10 minutes . Primary antibodies were then diluted in Trueblack  619 and used at the indicated dilution . Secondary antibodies were diluted in 10 % FCS , 0 . 1 % Triton 620 X - 100 in PBS . After incubation with antibodies , the cells were washed three times with PBS . 621 Finally , the cells were counterstained with DAPI and mounted on slides using ProLong TM Gold 622 antifade reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientific # P36934 ) . 623 Microscopy 624 Images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with a cooled charge - 625 coupled device Clara camera ( Andor Technology ) controlled by Nikon NIS - Elements software 626 version 4 . 30 . 02 . Images were acquired in 0 . 15 - 0 . 4  m sections using a plan apo 1 . 4 numerical 627 aperture 100X ( kinetochore analysis ) or 60X ( lagging chromosome analysis ) objective using 628 1X1 binning . Samples were illuminated using an X - cite light source ( Excelitas Technologies 629 Corp ) . All image analysis , adjustment and cropping was performed using Fiji software 52 . Image 630 deconvolution was performed using Nikon Elements batch deconvolution software version 631 5 . 21 . 00 on automatic mode . All kinetochore intensity analysis was performed on the raw images , 632 except for Figures 3a - b , for which deconvolution was performed prior to analysis . Line scans 633 were performed on the deconvoluted images in Fiji and the data was then exported to Graphpad 634 Prism . All images selected for presentation are deconvolved maximum - intensity Z - stack 635 projections . Where shown , insets are from single optical Z - slices . Images were selected to 636 represent the mean quantified data . Quantification of kinetochore staining intensity was 637 31 performed by first determining the brightest plane for which a given kinetochore appears . Then , 638 an outline was drawn using the ellipse tool . The integrated intensity was determined by 639 multiplying the average intensity by the area of the kinetochore . Background levels of staining 640 were determined by saturating the brightness and contrast settings to find the darkest spot within 641 the chromatin containing area and were subtracted from the intensity of the kinetochore . To 642 quantify levels of cold - stable microtubules , images were first deconvolved . Then , A sum - 643 intensity projection was created in Fiji . Viewing the ACA channel , a rectangle was drawn that 644 was 2  m wide in the pole - pole axis , and as long as the furthest centromeres in the metaphase 645 plate .
