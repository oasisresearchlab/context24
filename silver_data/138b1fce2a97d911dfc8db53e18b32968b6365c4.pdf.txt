We conducted a mechanistic modeling and calculated the exposure dose and infection risk of each passenger in a two - bus COVID - 19 outbreak in Hunan province , China . This outbreak originated from a single pre - symptomatic index case . Some human behavioral data related to exposure including boarding and alighting time of some passengers and seating position and mask wearing of all passengers were obtained from the available closed - circuit television images / clips and / or questionnaire survey . Least - squares fitting was performed to explore the effect of effective viral load on transmission risk , and the most likely quanta generation rate was also estimated . This study reveals the leading role of airborne SARS - CoV - 2 transmission J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 and negligible role of fomite transmission in a poorly ventilated indoor environment , highlighting the need for more targeted interventions in such environments . The quanta generation rate of the index case differed by a factor of 1 . 8 on the two buses and transmission occurred in the afternoon of the same day , indicating a time - varying effective viral load within a short period of five hours . Keywords : airborne transmission , fomite transmission , quanta generation rate , COVID - 19 1 . Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic , which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , is continuing worldwide . As of early October 2021 , nearly 240 million people had been infected with SARS - CoV - 2 and more than 4 . 8 million people had died from COVID - 19 ( https : / / covid19 . who . int / ) . And at least one third of SARS - CoV - 2 infections are asymptomatic ( Oran and Topol , 2021 ) . Efforts to identify the predominant transmission routes of SARS - CoV - 2 are ongoing . During the early phase of the pandemic , the World Health Organization ( WHO , 2020a ) recognized that SARS - CoV - 2 could be transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or by contact ( over short distances ) with droplets exhaled by an infected person , but airborne transmission was considered as unlikely . In the July 2020 update , the WHO recognized that airborne and fomite transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 might be possible , although there was no direct evidence for this ( WHO , 2020b ) . In their April 2021 update , the WHO emphasized the roles of “small liquid particles” in short - and long - range airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , and stated that fomite transmission was possible : “ [ p ] eople may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated by the virus when touching their eyes , nose or mouth without cleaning their hands . ” The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( US CDC , 2021 ) also stated that fomite transmission was possible but that “the risk is generally considered to be low . ” Our current understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission based on the first 16 – 17 months of the COVID - 19 pandemic suggests that evidence is needed to determine the relative importance of the routes of transmission . This information is essential for making evidence - based recommendation on effective non - pharmaceutical interventions to minimize transmission . The airborne transmission of respiratory viruses involves the expiration of fine virus - laden droplets from an infected person and their subsequent inhalation by a susceptible person . In contrast , fomite transmission is the transfer of surface - borne virus - laden respiratory droplets to a susceptible person ; this typically occurs when a person touches a surface bearing virus - laden droplets with his / her hand , and subsequently touches his / her exterior mucosa ( e . g . , eyes , nose , or mouth ) with the same hand , resulting in self - inoculation . Fomite transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 was first suspected following the reported survival ability of SARS - CoV - 2 on common surfaces ( Chin et al . , 2020 ; Doremalen et al . , 2020 ) . A subsequent experiment in golden hamsters revealed that airborne transmission was more common than fomite transmission ( Sia et al . , 2020 ) . Nevertheless , scientific and policy debates continue on the relative importance of long - range airborne and fomite routes in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 ( Li et al . , 2021a ; Morawska and Cao , 2020 ; Meselson , 2020 ) . Two types of data are essential for quantifying the transmission risk of respiratory viruses in indoor spaces . First , data are required on the ventilation rate in the indoor space at the time of exposure . However , a lack of accessibility typically hinders measurement of the ventilation rate at a venue where infection occurred , and such rates have not been reported in most of the published studies of COVID - 19 outbreaks ( e . g . , Bae et al . , 2020 ; Charlotte , 2020 ; Miller et al . , 2020 ) . Second , data are required on human behavior in the indoor space at the time of infection . However , obtaining these data is even more challenging than obtaining ventilation data . Although recordings of closed - circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras might be available , privacy concerns deter space owners from sharing these recordings . To the best of our knowledge , a restaurant outbreak in Guangzhou , China , is the only outbreak for which both ventilation rate data and human behavior data have been reported ( Li et al . , 2021b ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Zhang et al . ( 2021 ) obtained data of close contact between people and surface - touching by people for each second , and their analysis revealed little evidence of close - contact and surface - touch transmission in this outbreak . Another COVID - 19 outbreak occurred in January 2020 in Hunan province , China , and was caused by an infected 24 - year - old male who traveled successively on two buses , B1 ( 47 people ) and B2 ( 18 people ) , in the same afternoon . Ou et al . ( 2022 ) measured the ventilation rates on these two buses using a tracer - concentration decay method while the buses were being driven on the same routes ( by the same drivers ) they had taken on the day of the outbreak . Ten passengers were found to be infected during this outbreak : seven people ( including one asymptomatic person ) on B1 and two people on B2 when the index case was present , and one person on the return trip of B1 when the index case was not present . Thus , the attack rate was higher on B1 than on B2 . The time - averaged ventilation rate was also lower on B1 ( 1 . 7 L / s per person ) than on B2 ( 3 . 2 L / s per person ) . It was suggested that airborne transmission had occurred on both buses . There are various indoor spaces where there is a high risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , and research has focused on the risk in public transport cabins , such as passenger planes ( Bogoch et al . , 2020 ; Oztig et al . , 2020 ) , trains ( Zhao et al . , 2020 ) , and buses ( Zheng et al . , 2020 ) . These studies have mainly examined the association between travel and infection , but the association between cabin environment and transmission remains underreported . Multi - route mechanistic models have been developed to evaluate the infection exposure and risk for respiratory infection as affected by environmental parameters ( e . g . Atkinson and Wein , 2008 ) . Similar models have been successfully applied to investigate outbreaks of respiratory infection such as SARS ( Xiao et al . , 2017 ) , MERS ( 2018a ) and influenza ( 2018b ) . Here we consider both airborne and fomite transmission routes . The airborne transmission has been mostly modelled using a macroscopic mass balance equation approach by assuming that the airborne viral particles are uniformly distributed in an indoor space . It has been widely used ( e . g . Buonnano et al . 2020 ; Aganovic et al . 2021 ) , however , such an mixing assumption cannot reveal the effect of airflow non - uniformity . Computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) has been commonly used to explore the effect of non - uniform air distribution on the J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 infection risk , as done by Ou et al ( 2022 ) for this two - bus outbreak . Only steady state simulations were carried out in Ou et al ( 2022 ) . Additionally , one approach for evaluating infection risk due to the fomite route is to use a random discrete - time Markov Chain to quantify the surface transmission process . Such an approach has been evaluated using a small - scale benchtop experiment ( Xiao et al . 2018c ) and a flight cabin outbreak of norovirus ( Lei et al . 2017 ) . The data of the two - bus outbreak reported by Ou et al . ( 2022 ) offers an opportunity to perform a mechanistic modeling study of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . We therefore mathematically modeled and compared the risk of each passenger on both buses to infection via the fomite and airborne routes . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 The outbreak The index case , a 24 - year - old male , had symptom onset in the late afternoon on January 22 , 2020 , after he took two buses successively on this day . Seven days later , on January 29 , 2020 , he was confirmed to have COVID - 19 . Contact tracing was performed and ten passengers on the two buses were confirmed to be infected : 7 of the 46 passengers on the first bus ( a large bus denoted B1 , Figure 1 ( a ) ) , 1 passenger on the return trip of the same bus ( B1 ) , and 2 of the 16 passengers on the second bus ( a minibus denoted B2 , Figure 1 ( b ) ) . On B1 , the bus driver was not infected ; on B2 , neither the bus driver nor the conductor was infected . The basic information of all patients can be found in Ou et al . ( 2022 ) . In this study , the infected passenger on the return trip of B1 is not studied . All the infected passengers had symptom onset within 14 days of their trips on these buses . On and around January 22 , 2020 , there were very few confirmed cases in Hunan province , and thus the infected passengers on these buses were unlikely to have been in contact with other infected people . As a result , the 24 - year - old male was believed to be the index case of this outbreak ( Ou et al . , 2022 ) . In most reported COVID - 19 outbreaks , an index case led to a single outbreak in a single infection venue . In contrast , this Hunan outbreak involved two successive buses ( B1 and B2 ) that the index case traveled on in a single afternoon : his B1 journey took 3 h and 20 min , whereas his B2 journey took 1 h . The index case boarded B2 within 15 min of alighting B1 , and he was one of the first five passengers to board B1 . ( a ) J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 ( b ) Figure 1 . Seating arrangements of the two buses involved in the Hunan two - bus COVID - 19 outbreak . ( a ) B1 , ( b ) B2 . The seats on which the index case and infected cases sat are colored dark blue and light cyan , respectively ; empty seats are colored gray . All of the seats are labeled by a unique number and letter combination , except for the seats of the driver and conductor , which are labeled as D and C , respectively . The seat labels of passengers who wore a face mask are colored dark blue and bolded . The epidemiological and environmental studies of this two - bus outbreak were conducted by Ou et al . ( 2022 ) . They carried out detailed measurements of the ventilation rates and the dispersion of expired droplets ( using tracer gas as surrogate ) on the same buses being driven on the same routes they had been driven on January 22 , 2020 . They concluded that the outbreak on the two buses was due to long - range airborne transmission , although they did not investigate the possible contribution of fomite transmission . Figure 2 summarizes the journey timelines of the two buses . CCTV recordings had been made on the two buses at the time of the exposure event , but unfortunately these recordings were erased after the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention had reviewed them in the early phase of their investigations ( Ou et al . , 2022 ) . However , three screenshots of B1 recordings , four screenshots of B2 recordings , and the departure / arrival video clips of B2 , were saved . These images were used to obtain data on passengers’ mask wearing and other behaviors for the current study . Some of the screenshots are given as sketches for readers’ comprehension ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . B1 departed from Changsha station at 12 : 10 and arrived at a southern town station ( city D station ) at 15 : 30 ( Figure 2a ) . The screenshots of the CCTV recordings from B1 ( Figure 3 ) and passengers’ questionnaire survey data show that two passengers ( in seats 9C and 13D , respectively ; hereafter , all passengers are referred to by their seat label ) boarded B1 approximately 40 – 45 min into its trip , and four passengers ( 3C , 3D , 13B , and 13E ) alighted approximately 16 km before city D station . For details , please refer to Tables S1 and S2 . B2 departed from city D station at 15 : 43 and arrived at village H station at 16 : 43 ( Figure 2b ) . The screenshots of the CCTV recordings from B2 ( Figure 4 ) and passengers’ questionnaire survey data show that three passengers ( 3B , 3C , and 5A ) boarded after the index case ( 4C ) at city D station , and that four passengers ( 3A , 5C , 5D , and 5E ) boarded later during the trip of B2 , before 16 : 00 . Four passengers ( 1B , 4A with a baby , and 4B ) alighted approximately 15 – J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 20 min before the end of the trip , and three passengers ( 3A , 3B , and 5A ) alighted later , near village H station . For details , please refer to Tables S1 and S2 . ( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 . The trip timelines of the two buses involved in the Hunan two - bus COVID - 19 outbreak . The bus measured ventilation rate is affected by its speed , and each speed range is referred to as a phase . There are 8 phases ( 1 - 8 ) with two sub - phases in Phase 1 ( i . e . 1a and 1b ) and Phase 8 ( i . e . 8a and 8b ) each . The bus speed in each phase of the two buses is summarized in Table S1 . ( a ) B1 . Two 15 - min time slots ( 11 : 55 – 12 : 10 and 15 : 30 – 15 : 45 ) were allocated before and after the journey , during which passengers boarded or alighted the bus . ( b ) B2 . Two 5 - min time slots ( 15 : 38 – 15 : 43 and 16 : 43 – 16 : 48 ) were allocated before and after the journey , during which passengers boarded or alighted the bus . Note that two 5 - min time slots and three 2 - min time slots were considered for passengers to board or alight B1 or B2 , respectively , during the journeys of these buses ( as the actual boarding and alighting durations during the journeys were unknown ) . Each phase is represented by a number or a number and letter combination . Each number marks a specific driving speed , bus location and ventilation rate . The letter “a” and “b” means that the index case was not on the bus and on the bus , respectively . T id , on and T id , off are the time when the index case boarded and alighted the bus , respectively . For details , please refer to Tables S1 and S2 .

( d ) Passenger positions and behaviors at 16 : 43 : 33 . 2 . 2 Modeling framework We first investigated the spatial characteristics of transmission by modeling a baseline scenario to estimate risk of the infection via fomite and airborne transmission on both buses . The index case did not show any symptoms , and did not talk with any passenger during the two bus journeys . We thus considered normal breathing ( in through the nose and out through the mouth ) ( Morawska et al . , 2009 ) as his only respiratory activity . We did not consider the child carried by his mother ( passenger 4A ) on B2 as he was exposed to a similar transmission risk as his mother . A least - squares fitting was performed to determine the probable values of the unknown parameters mentioned above and the dominant transmission route . Finally , the quanta generation rate of the index case on both buses was estimated . For the details of parameter values , please refer to Table S3 - S7 . 2 . 2 . 1 Fomite transmission route People can self - inoculate by touching their mucous membranes after touching a contaminated object ( fomite ) . We used the surface contamination model ( Xiao et al . , 2018a ) to calculate the viral load on various fomites ( environmental surfaces ) and on passengers’ hands and mucus J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 membrane . The process by which viruses spread within a surface network was modeled as a discrete - time non - homogeneous Markov chain . Our Markov chain model was verified using data from two inflight norovirus outbreaks and from a small - scale benchtop experiment ( Lei et al . 2017 ; Xiao et al . 2018c ) . Three kinds of touching behaviors were included in the fomite transmission route : touching the door rail and aisle seatbacks when boarding or alighting a bus ; or touching surrounding surfaces ( the back of the seat in front of a passenger’s seat or the armrest of the passenger’s or conductor’s seat ( if any ) , the steering wheel and gear lever ( for the driver ) ) when seated ; touching their own mucous membranes ( e . g . , eyes , nose , or mouth ) . The total exposure dose of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ individual via the fomite transmission route was calculated as follows : 𝐷 𝑓𝑖 = ∑ 𝑃 𝑚𝑖 , 𝑘 𝐶 ℎ𝑖 , 𝑘 𝐴 𝑐𝑚𝑖 𝛼 ℎ𝑚𝑖 𝑁 𝑘 𝑘 = 1 ( 1 ) where 𝑁 𝑘 is the total number of time steps in each random simulation for each bus ( 920 on B1 and 280 on B2 , with each time - step equals to 15 s , including boarding and alighting periods ) ; 𝑃 𝑚 𝑖 , 𝑘 is the indicator of the touching behavior of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ individual in the 𝑘 𝑡ℎ time step , which equals 1 if the individual touches his / her mucous membrane and equals 0 otherwise ; 𝐶 ℎ𝑖 , 𝑘 is the virus concentration ( RNA copies / cm 2 ) on the hand of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ individual in the 𝑘 𝑡ℎ time - step ; 𝐴 𝑐𝑚𝑖 is the contact area between the hand of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ individual and his / her mucous membrane ; and 𝛼 ℎ𝑚𝑖 is the virus transfer rate from the hand of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ individual to his / her mucous membrane . 2 . 2 . 2 Airborne transmission route We combined the short - range and long - range airborne routes as the airborne route . Estimating the infection risk from airborne transmission required the determination of the total inhalation exposure of all passengers during the entire journey of each bus , for which at least two factors needed to be considered . First , the spatial distribution of expired aerosols , i . e . droplet nuclei of the fine expired droplets , is not uniform , although relatively good mixing is obtained for exhaled tracer gas in steady - state computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) simulations ( Ou et al . , 2022 ) . In Ou et al ( 2022 ) , most boundary conditions were obtained from the field experiments , and the predictions were validated by data from the field tracer gas experiment on the original two buses . Second , there can be significant temporal variation of infectious aerosols concentration on each bus . During their journey , each bus was driven through different phases characterized by different ventilation rates . Temporal changes were expected when one phase is switched to another phase . This was further complicated by the fact that the measured ventilation rate of a bus is affected by its speed ( each speed range is referred to as a phase ) . There are 8 phases ( 1 - 8 ) with two sub - phases in Phase 1 ( i . e . 1a and 1b ) and Phase 8 ( i . e . 8a and 8b ) each . The bus speed , location , and window opening in each phase of the two buses are summarized in Table S1 . Thus , transient CFD simulations of the passengers’ and the driver’s / conductor’s inhalation exposures to exhaled droplets of different sizes on the two buses during their journeys would require prolonged computational time . We therefore used a simplified approach : we assumed that the spatial distribution of the expired aerosols would remain unchanged and equal that predicted by steady - state CFD in Ou et al . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 ( 2022 ) . We modeled the temporal effect using the classical macroscopic mass - balance equation model , which considers removal by ventilation , virus deactivation , and deposition ( Aganovic et al . 2021 ; Buonanno et al , 2020 ) . The total exposure is thus estimated in four steps . First , the transient concentration 𝐶 ( 𝑑 𝑚𝑑 , 𝑡 ) for droplet nuclei of diameter 𝑑 𝑚𝑑 at time 𝑡 on each of the two buses was determined using the macroscopic equation . Second , the ratio 𝑅 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) of the droplet nuclei concentration at the mouth area of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ passenger at time 𝑡 to that in the entire bus was estimated . Note that the ratio 𝑅 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) is independent of droplet nuclei size . Third , the droplet nuclei concentration 𝐶 𝑖 ( 𝑑 𝑚𝑑 , 𝑡 ) at the mouth area of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ passenger was calculated as the product of 𝐶 ( 𝑑 𝑚𝑑 , 𝑡 ) and 𝑅 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) . These first three steps are explained in the Supplementary Materials S1 . 2 . Finally , the total dose of exposure 𝐷 𝑎𝑖 of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ passenger via airborne transmission were evaluated as follows : 𝐷 𝑎𝑖 = ∑ ∫ 𝐶 𝑖 ( 𝑑 𝑚𝑑 , 𝑡 ) · 𝐼𝑅 · 𝐸 𝑚𝑑 · 1 6 𝑡 𝑒𝑛𝑖 𝑡 𝑠𝑡𝑖 4𝑚𝑑 = 1 𝜋𝑑 𝑜 , 𝑚𝑑3 · 𝐿 𝑜 4 · ( 1 − 𝜑 ) 𝑃 𝜑𝑖 ∙ 𝑑𝑡 ( 2 ) where four different sizes ( median diameter , or 𝑚𝑑 = 1 to 4 ) of initially exhaled droplets were considered ( 0 . 8 , 1 . 8 , 3 . 5 , and 5 . 5 μm ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) , 𝑡 𝑠𝑡 and 𝑡 𝑒𝑛 are the moments when the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ passenger boards and alights a bus , respectively ; IR is the inhalation rate , which was assumed to be 0 . 49 m 3 / h ( Adams , 1993 ) ; 𝐸 𝑚𝑑 is the deposition efficiency of droplets of diameter 𝑑 𝑚𝑑 in the respiratory tract , as obtained from the International Commission on Radiological Protection ( ICRP ) deposition model ( ICRP , 1994 ) ; 𝐿 𝑜 is the concentration of viral RNA in the initially exhaled droplets ( which was set as 1 × 10 9 RNA copies / mL in the baseline scenario ) , which was divided by 4 as the number of viable viruses will decrease to 25 % of its original value after full evaporation of the droplets ( Xiao et al . , 2018a ) ; 𝜑 is the filtration efficiency of a face mask with ear loops ( which was assumed to be 0 . 381 in this study ( Sickbert - Bennett et al . , 2020 ) ) ; and 𝑃 𝜑𝑖 is the indicator of whether the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ individual wears a mask , which equals 1 if he / she is wearing a mask and 0 otherwise . Note that we assumed a constant 𝐿 𝑜 for all droplet sizes . 2 . 3 Least - squares fitting To avoid the effect on the simulation results brought by randomness , the simulation was conducted 1000 times for each bus . The predicted infection risk 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑙 of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ passenger in the 𝑙 𝑡ℎ simulation was calculated based on the dose – response relationship : 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑙 = 1 − 𝑒 −𝜂 𝑚 𝐷 𝑓𝑖 , 𝑙 −𝜂 𝑟 𝐷 𝑎𝑖 , 𝑙 ( 3 ) where 𝜂 𝑟 and 𝜂 𝑚 are the dose – response parameters in the respiratory tract and mucous membrane , respectively , and 𝐷 𝑓𝑖 , 𝑙 and 𝐷 𝑎𝑖 , 𝑙 are 𝐷 𝑓𝑖 and 𝐷 𝑎𝑖 in the 𝑙 𝑡ℎ simulation , respectively . The transmission risk is denoted “to one” or “ : 1” ( decimals ) in this paper . Three viral load related parameters of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission remain unknown , i . e . the initial virus concentration 𝐿 𝑜 in exhaled droplets and the dose – response parameters in the respiratory tract and mucous membrane , i . e . , 𝜂 𝑟 and 𝜂 𝑚 , respectively . We adopted least - squares fitting to explore the probable values of these parameters and the dominant J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 transmission route . To reduce the number of variables , we combined 𝐿 𝑜 , 𝜂 𝑟 and 𝜂 𝑚 as the effective inhalation viral load 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 and effective membrane viral load 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 . Exhaled droplets of all sizes tend to have the same viral concentration ( load ) , expressed as RNA copies per mL ( Xiao et al . , 2018a ) . Examining equations ( 1 - 3 ) , as the dose - response parameters 𝜂 𝑟 , 𝜂 𝑚 and the viral load 𝐿 𝑜 are constant , the effective inhalation viral load 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 and effective membrane viral load 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 can be determined if the infection risk is known as in the two - bus outbreak . Following a lack of viral load data of the index case , we assigned a series of values ( 1 × 10 6 to 1 × 10 11 RNA copies / mL ) , previously confirmed in patients on the day before or after symptom onset ( e . g . , Jones et al . , 2021 ; Kim et al . , 2020 ) , to viral load L o . 𝜂 𝑟 and 𝜂 𝑚 were assumed to be 1 × 10 −1 to 1 × 10 1 and 1 × 10 −4 to 1 × 10 −2 , respectively , as in Xiao et al . ( 2018a ) , i . e . , 𝜂 𝑟 was three orders of magnitude greater than 𝜂 𝑚 . We assigned 29 discrete values ( increasing by 1 × 10 0 . 25 ) in the range of 1 × 10 5 – 1× 10 12 to 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 and 17 discrete values in the range of 1 × 10 2 – 1 × 10 9 to 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 , and ensured that the ratio of 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 to 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 was in the range of 1 × 10 1 – 1 × 10 5 ( increasing by 1 × 10 0 . 25 ) , which is the same as the ratio of 𝜂 𝑟 to 𝜂 𝑚 ( Table S8 ) . After eliminating some inappropriate scenarios , a total of 429 scenarios were considered in this study . The residual sum of squares ( RSS ) for each scenario was averaged over 1 , 000 simulations to estimate the fitness between the modeled infection risk and the reported attack rate , i . e . , a smaller RSS represents a better fit . 𝑅𝑆𝑆 = 1 𝑁 𝑙 ∑ ∑ [ 𝐼 𝑖 − 𝑃 𝑖 , 𝑙 ( 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 , 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 ) ] 2 𝑁 𝑝 𝑖 = 1 𝑁 𝑙 𝑙 = 1 ( 4 ) where 1 × 10 5 < 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 < 1 × 10 12 ; 1 × 10 2 < 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 < 1 × 10 9 ; 𝑁 𝑙 is the number of random simulations ( = 1 , 000 in total ) ; 𝑁 𝑝 is the number of passengers on each bus ( excluding the index case ) ; 𝐼 𝑖 is the infection indicator of each passenger ( and equals 1 for an infected passenger and 0 for a non - infected passenger . The values of the effective inhalation viral load 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 and effective membrane viral load 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 obtained for the best - fit scenario predict the viral load at the time of infection ( Xiao et al . , 2018a ) . After having determined the best - fit scenario , i . e . , the one with the minimum RSS , we compared the fomite transmission risk and airborne transmission risk of SARS - CoV - 2 . If transmission by the fomite route was negligible , this outbreak could be considered a case of airborne dominant transmission , and thus the quanta generation rate of the index case on each bus could be calculated . 2 . 4 Quanta generation rate As in section 2 . 3 , we determined the best - fitting value of effective inhalation viral load 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 on each bus , which was used to estimate the quanta generation rate 𝑄 𝑖 ( quanta / h ) of the index case on each bus . 𝑄 𝑖 = ∑ 𝐸 𝑚𝑑 · 1 6 4𝑚𝑑 = 1 𝜋𝑑 𝑜 , 𝑚𝑑 3 ∙ 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 / 4 · 𝑁 𝑚𝑑 ∙ 𝐼𝑅 ( 5 ) where 𝑚𝑑 = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 represents four sizes of the initially exhaled droplets as defined earlier ; J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 𝐸 𝑚𝑑 is the deposition efficiency of droplets of diameter 𝑑 𝑚𝑑 ( Table S3 ) in the respiratory tract , as obtained from the ICRP deposition model ( ICRP , 1994 ) ; the effective inhalation viral load 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 was determined by least - squares fitting , independent of droplet size , as 1 . 778 × 10 9 / mL and 3 . 162 × 10 9 / mL on B1 and B2 , respectively ; 𝑁 𝑚𝑑 is the number concentration of droplets with an initial diameter 𝑑 𝑜 , 𝑚𝑑 in the exhaled air ; and 𝐼𝑅 is the exhalation flow rate ( equals to inhalation flow rate ) for a resting person ( Adams , 1993 ) , which was assumed to be 0 . 49 m 3 / h . One quantum in the estimated quanta generation rate in this study can be understood as one viable SARS - CoV - 2 virus that could deposit on susceptible individuals’ respiratory tract and initiate infection . 3 . Results 3 . 1 Spatial characteristics of predicted infection - risk patterns The predicted infection risks via fomite transmission on both buses are presented in Figure 5a and 5c . The overall infection risk via fomite transmission was negligible for many passengers on both buses . The aisle - seat passengers on both buses had a higher infection risk via fomite transmission than the window - seat passengers . This may be because passengers on the aisle side were in contact with contaminated armrests ( non - porous surfaces ) , which transfer virus - containing droplets more efficiently to human hands than seatbacks ( porous surfaces ) ( Xiao et al . , 2018a ) . For example , passenger 13E on B1 could touch both armrests of his / her seat , the non - porous surfaces of which could have transferred virus - containing droplets efficiently to his / her hands . Thus , passenger 13E was estimated to have a high infection risk via fomite transmission , even if the concentration of virus on the surfaces surrounding him / her was similar to that in droplets on surfaces surrounding his / her neighboring passengers ( Figure S1 ) . The predicted infection risks via airborne transmission on both buses are presented in Figure 5b and 5d , where different color scales are used to denote the fomite and airborne transmission routes . The overall infection risk via the airborne route was much higher ( approximately 1 × 10 6 - fold to 1 × 10 8 - fold higher ) than that via the fomite route in the baseline scenarios . Unlike the fomite transmission route , the high infection risk via the airborne transmission route was not restricted to the aisle - seat passengers or to those near the index case , e . g . , the driver and the conductor on B2 . Moreover , passengers on these two buses faced different levels of infection risk via airborne transmission , owing to their different journey lengths and the different ventilation rates of the buses . This was also true for passengers on the same bus . For example , on B2 , the virus concentrations in the mouth area of passengers 2B and 5C were quite similar ( Figure S1 ; Ou et al . , 2022 ) , but passenger 5C spent at least 15 min less than passenger 2B aboard B2 , as passenger 2B boarded the bus after passenger 5C . Therefore , the infection risk of passenger 5C was lower than that of passenger 2B .

There are two numbers in each seat square : the number at the top is the seat label , while that at the bottom is the simulated infection risk . 3 . 2 Predicted scenarios with the best fit The RSS values for a total of 429 scenarios in each bus are shown in Figures S2 and S3 . On B1 , there were 17 best - fit scenarios with the same RSS value of 5 . 994 and the effective inhalation viral load 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 value of 1 . 778 × 10 9 . On B2 , there were 14 best - fit scenarios with the same RSS value of 1 . 826 and the effective inhalation viral load 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 value of 3 . 162 × 10 9 . The most - likely scenario for each bus ( the scenario with the highest the effective membrane viral load 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 ) is shown in Table 1 . The predicted infection risks of passengers seated in different parts of each bus were closer to the reported attack rate in B1 than to that in B2 . The differences between the observed and predicted infection risk in some parts of the two buses might be explained by the small sample size , errors in the human behavior data and other unknown factors . In addition , on both buses , the infection risk via airborne transmission was equal ( to up to 3 decimal places ) to that via multi - route transmission , whereas the infection risk via fomite transmission was almost 0 , which highlights the predominance of the airborne transmission route and the insignificance of the fomite transmission route in this outbreak .

We chose to present the scenario with the largest 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 value . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 b Please refer to Table S9 for seat classifications . 3 . 3 Predicted quanta generation rate of the index case on the two buses The results shown in section 3 . 2 reveal that the two - bus outbreak was predominantly an airborne transmission outbreak , as the contribution of fomite transmission in the best - fit scenarios was almost zero . The predicted quanta generation rate on B1 was 37 . 07 quanta / h , which is only 56 % of that on B2 ( 65 . 92 quanta / h ) . 4 . Discussion 4 . 1 Fomite transmission played a negligible role in the two - bus COVID - 19 outbreak in Hunan One of the most important findings of this modeling study of the two - bus COVID - 19 outbreak in Hunan is that the fomite transmission route did not play a significant role in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . The predicted infection risk via the airborne transmission route was 0 . 162 ( 16 . 2 % ) on B1 and 0 . 113 ( 11 . 3 % ) on B2 , whereas that via the fomite transmission route was only 3 . 154 × 10 −6 ( 0 . 000315 % ) on B1 and 4 . 688 × 10 −5 ( 0 . 00469 % ) on B2 . The settings on the two buses might offer some explanation for this difference : that is , the setting suggests that there were minimal interactions between passengers . This is particularly true for B1 , which was travelling at a relatively high speed on a highway ; none of its passengers left their seats during the entire journal , except during alighting , and no passenger used the on - board toilet . In addition , digital tickets were used on both buses , and thus passengers could only have had the opportunity to touch common surfaces while boarding or alighting . Furthermore , the index case did not show any symptoms during his journey , and he did not speak to anyone , and thus the only direct source of virus - laden droplets from this passenger would have been from normal breathing ( with droplets in the range of 0 . 8 – 5 . 5 µm ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . These small - sized droplets evaporate immediately after release , and have small nuclei ; thus , there would have been only a low concentration of these nuclei deposited on any touchable surfaces ( fomites ) on the buses . This means it is probable that an insignificant number of viable viruses would have been present on only a small number of common surfaces . Our results are in line with the general consensus on the fomite transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in the literature . Many environmental surface sampling studies have suggested that fomites and other surfaces in healthcare settings are not contaminated with viable SARS - CoV - 2 ( e . g . , Chia et al . , 2020 ; Colaneri et al . , 2021 ) . A commentary by Goldman ( 2020 ) suggested that the risk of fomite transmission was low , which was echoed by Mondelli et al . ( 2020 ) . A recent modeling study also suggested that the risk of fomite transmission is low ( Pitol and Julian , 2021 ) . Our modeling data for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the two - bus outbreak are in contrast with the findings for a norovirus outbreak on a Boeing 747 airplane ( Lei et al . , 2017 ) , in which the modeled fomite transmission risk was 25 . 6 % ( i . e . , 0 . 256 ) , while the reported infection risk was 33 . 6 % ( i . e . , 0 . 336 ) . In addition , the indoor settings also differ between our J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 study and this previous study . In the airplane cabin , the toilet surfaces were contaminated , and some passengers visited the toilets during the 3 - h flight , touching the aisle seatbacks on their way to and back from the toilet . One interesting observation is that one passenger , 9D , who had no contact with the index case , became infected during the return trip of B1 from city D to Changsha , when the index case was not present ( Ou et al . , 2022 ) . B1 stayed in city D for 30 min before starting its return trip to Changsha , and it remains unknown how passenger 9D became infected on this return trip . Notably , the passenger who sat in 9D on the first trip of B1 was also infected . If fomite transmission had caused the infection , a few more passengers should have been infected on the return trip of B1 , as no surface disinfection was conducted in B1 during its stop in city D . Thus , it would be useful to explore whether fomite transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 via surface touch is possible for this case . Such transmission would require a larger exposure dose than that for airborne transmission , which is why we set such 𝜂 𝑚 𝐿 𝑜 < < 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 ( Table S8 ) . According to the steady - state CFD simulations , passengers on seats 9C / D , 10C / D , 11C / D are surrounded by a polluted air cloud with the second highest tracer gas concentration ( see Figure 3 in Ou et al . 2022 ) . The seat and other nearby surfaces might have been contaminated by the deposited aerosols . Importantly , virus particles deposited on a fomite can be resuspended , i . e . , become airborne . Licina and Nazaroff ( 2018 ) showed that up to 3 % of the deposited particles on cloth were subsequently released with fabric motion . Qian and Ferro ( 2008 ) showed how feet tapping can lead to resuspension . Accordingly , we speculate that the action of sitting on a seat can also lead to the release of viral particles from the seat into the air . Some studies have suggested that fomites in cold - chain transport might also lead to transmission ( e . g . , Ji et al . , 2021 ) . Our speculated fomite - resuspension mechanism warrants further in - depth study to verify the possible roles of contaminated fomites in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . 4 . 2 Predominance of airborne transmission The second major finding of this study is that airborne transmission was the predominant route of virus transmission in the two - bus outbreak . The significance of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 has now been widely recognized ( e . g . , Miller et al . , 2020 ) . In fact , one of the authors ( Li ) has presented the data of this Hunan two - bus outbreak ( including detailed data on ventilation rates ) at various international workshops since mid - 2020 , including those organized by the WHO . Notably , this is one of the very few SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks for which detailed data were available on the ventilation of infection venues . During the past decades , airborne transmission has been shown to be an important transmission route for SARS - CoV - 1 in indoor environments ( Li et al . , 2005 ; Yu et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , considering the similarities between SARS - CoV - 1 and SARS - CoV - 2 ( Yan et al . , 2020 ) , it is likely that airborne transmission plays the leading role in COVID - 19 spread . The unique aspect of this Hunan bus outbreak is that two infection venues were involved in the same outbreak : to our knowledge , no other multi - venue outbreak involving a single index case has been reported . Our findings regarding this outbreak have significant implications . If J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 we assume that the expired source strength of the virus from the index case was the same on both buses , it is intriguing that each bus had a different attack rate . This may be related to the fact that the time - averaged ventilation rates were 1 . 72 L / s per person on B1 and 3 . 22 L / s per person on B2 , both of which are lower than the recommended 8 – 10 L / s per person for offices and other indoor settings ( e . g . , ASHRAE 62 . 1 , 2019 ) . Thus , the observed attack rates were 0 . 152 ( or 15 . 2 % ) on B1 and 0 . 118 ( or 11 . 8 % ) on B2 , and the predicted attack rates due to airborne transmission were 0 . 162 ( or 16 . 2 % ) on B1 and 0 . 113 ( or 11 . 3 % ) on B2 . The predicted attack rates are very similar to the corresponding observed attack rates , and the higher ventilation rate on B2 corresponds to the lower attack rate on B2 than on B1 . Note that the air flows on the two buses were reasonably mixed but not fully mixed ( Ou et al . , 2022 ) , and that air flow patterns are known to affect rates of infection ( Qian and Zheng , 2018 ) . The so - called best - fit scenarios on both buses warrant discussion . In the predicted best - fit scenario , the effective inhalation viral load 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 on B1 was 1 . 778 × 10 9 , while that on B2 was 3 . 162 × 10 9 . Thus , the effective inhalation viral load 𝜂 𝑟 𝐿 𝑜 for the best - fit scenario on B2 was 1 . 8 times that on B1 , suggesting that the viral load on B2 was higher than that on B1 . This trend agrees with the estimated infectious quanta generation rates on the two buses ( 35 . 0 h −1 on B1 and 58 . 3 h −1 on B2 ) reported by Ou et al . ( 2022 ) under a steady - state assumption , with the quanta generation rate on B2 being 1 . 7 times that on B1 . Both the quanta estimate by Ou et al ( 2022 ) and our new best - fit scenario estimate revealed that there was a larger viral load released on B2 than on B1 . This is attributable to the fact that there can be significant variations in the SARS - CoV - 2 load of droplets expired by the same person over a 4 – 6 - h period , as the peak - load period is around the time of symptom onset ( e . g . , Jones et al . , 2021 ; Kim et al . , 2020 ) . The video clip of B2 departing revealed that while the index case was waiting in the aisle to sit , two passengers ( who appeared to be a young mother with a 5 – 7 - year - old girl , who had been passengers on an earlier journey of B2 ) who had been sitting on seats at the back walked past the index case and then alighted the bus . The mother and the index case had a few seconds of face - to - face close contact during this movement , but neither she nor the young girl became infected . 4 . 3 Implications for infection control and further studies This modeling study has revealed the predominance of airborne transmission and the insignificance of fomite transmission in the two - bus COVID - 19 outbreak in Hunan . This is the second outbreak for which data were available on human behavior at the time of infection , together with detailed data on the environmental conditions at the infection venue . The first such COVID - 19 outbreak for which detailed data were available occurred in a restaurant in Guangzhou in early 2020 , and has been studied by Li et al . ( 2021b ) and Zhang et al . ( 2021 ) . The conclusions of these studies were similar to our own conclusion regarding the relative importance of airborne and fomite routes of transmission , except for one key difference . In the Guangzhou restaurant outbreak , the measured ventilation rate was approximately 1 L / s per person , whereas in the two - bus outbreak , the measured ventilation rates were higher ( 1 . 7 L / s per person and 3 . 2 L / s per person ) . Thus , our study shows that a J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 ventilation rate of 3 . 2 L / s per person is insufficient to control SARS - CoV - 2 transmission between people at rest . This study is also the first to reveal that the release rate of infectious aerosols from the same pre - symptomatic index case can vary over a 5 - h period . For instance , the release rate of infectious aerosols from the index case varied significantly between the first 3 - h - 20 - min trip and the subsequent 1 - h trip , despite the time between these trips being less than 15 min . Thus , the source strength differed for this same index case over a single afternoon . The Wells – Riley equation or its variants may be used for estimating threshold ventilation rates . Such an approach is only meaningful if all possible infectious quanta generation rates are known for a given scenario . Further studies of temporal variations in infectious quanta generation rates are needed . Note that temporal variations in infectious quanta generation rate do not track with temporal variations in viral load ( Jones et al . , 2021 ; Kim et al . , 2020 ) , as a viral load profile is not indicative of infectiousness . Although the typical route of fomite transmission ( that initiated by a hand touching a fomite bearing droplets containing virus ) might not play a significant role in virus transmission , the resuspension of virus - laden droplets deposited on fomites creates virus - laden aerosols that can lead to airborne transmission . We thus hypothesize that the resuspension of virus - laden droplets from fomites might contribute to the transmission of respiratory viruses such as SARS - CoV - 2 . Further research is warranted to gather evidence to support or refute this hypothesis . 4 . 4 Limitations Our study has several major limitations . First , the sample size in the two - bus outbreak was small , as it included only 10 infected passengers : 7 of the 46 passengers on B1 , 1 passenger on the return trip of B1 ( when the index case was not present ) , and 2 of the 16 passengers on B2 . We speculate that the analysis of ventilation and human behavior data for a much larger outbreak ( should these data become available ) would yield a more meaningful predicted viral load in a best - fit scenario than that we obtained in the current study . Second , the human behavior data we used might deviate from real data , as complete CCTV recordings of the infection event were not available . Thus , the boarding and alighting times of most passengers were unknown , and had to be randomly assigned , as did passengers’ surface - touching frequency . Most human behavior data were obtained from the re - collection performed by Hunan CDC staff who had reviewed the full CCTV recordings , and the remaining data were obtained from three screenshots of B1 recordings , four screenshots of B2 recordings , video clips of the departure / arrival of B2 , and a questionnaire survey answered by some of the passengers . Fortunately , our engineering team was able to measure the ventilation rates in the two buses as these buses were being driven on the same routes ( by the same drivers ) they had taken on the day of the outbreak , before these buses were sold by the bus company . Our engineering team was not involved in the initial epidemiological study of this outbreak . It is recommended that an engineering team is involved in any future outbreak investigations . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 19 Third , our methodology has several shortcomings . For example , we integrated the macroscopic mass - balance equation model with steady - state CFD simulated data to account for the non - uniform distribution of virus - laden droplets in the bus cabin , by using an instantaneous distribution from the steady state CFD simulation to represent any change in conditions . In addition , we assumed there was a constant ventilation rate in each phase of the trip ( in reality , the ventilation rate changes according to bus speed and wind direction ) . Moreover , we used droplet - release data from the literature for the index case ; however , there is known to be significant inter - individual variability in droplet release . Finally , we also assumed that there was an identical viral concentration in all droplets , irrespective of their size . More efforts to collect input data for outbreak modeling are warranted as such modeling can provide useful insights into several epidemiological factors , as demonstrated in our study . 5 . Conclusion We modeled SARS - CoV - 2 transmission that occurred during the two - bus COVID - 19 outbreak in Hunan , China , in January 2020 . Our results show that airborne transmission was predominant in this outbreak , whereas fomite transmission was negligible . A ventilation rate of 3 . 2 L / s per person was found to be insufficient to prevent infection , suggesting that the threshold ventilation rate for the minimization of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is greater than 3 . 2 L / s per person . We found that the release rate of infectious aerosols from the single pre - symptomatic index case in the two bus trips varied over a 5 - h period , indicating that the source strength differed significantly in the index case over this short period . This suggests the need for further studies of temporal variations in the infectious quanta generation rate of SARS - CoV - 2 . Notably , it remains unknown how a passenger became infected on the return trip of one of the buses when the index case was not present . Although we found that the fomite route ( via surface touch ) made an insignificant contribution to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission during this two - bus outbreak , our hypothesis that the resuspension of virus - laden droplets from fomites may contribute to airborne transmission warrants further exploration .

Graphical abstract Hunan two - bus COVID - 19 Outbreak : an infected 24 - year - old male took two subsequent buses B1 and B2 in the afternoon of January 22 , 2020 . Phenomena : B1 : lower ventilation ( 1 . 7 L / s per person ) , higher attack rate ( 15 . 2 % ) . B2 : higher ventilation ( 3 . 2 L / s per person ) , lower attack rate ( 11 . 8 % ) . Conclusion : B1 : lower viral load ( 37 . 1 quanta / h ) B2 : higher viral load ( 65 . 9 quanta / h ) B1 & B2 : fomite transmission did not play a role while airborne transmission predominated . index case infected non - infected B2 B1 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 24 CRediT authorship contribution statement Pan Cheng , Kaiwei Luo , Shenglan Xiao : Conceptualization , Methodology , Software , Investigation , Formal analysis , Data curation , Visualization , Writing – original draft , Writing – review & editing .
