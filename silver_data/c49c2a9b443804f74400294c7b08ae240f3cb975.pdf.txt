Although SI is commonly considered following a probability distribution at a population scale , recent studies reported slight shrinkage ( or contraction ) of the mean of effective SI across transmission generations or over time . Here , we develop a likelihood - based statistical inference framework with truncation to explore the change in SI across transmission generations after adjusting the impacts of case isolation . The COVID - 19 contact tracing surveillance data in Hong Kong are used for exemplification . We find that for COVID - 19 , the mean of individual SI is likely to shrink with a factor at 0 . 72 per generation ( 95 % CI : 0 . 54 , 0 . 96 ) as the transmission generation increases , where a threshold may exist as the lower boundary of this shrinking process . We speculate that one of the probable explanations for the shrinkage in SI might be an outcome due to the competition among multiple candidate infectors within a cluster of cases . Thus , the nonpharmaceutical interventive strategies are crucially important to block the transmission chains , and mitigate the COVID - 19 epidemic . Keywords : COVID - 19 ; serial interval ; transmission generation ; contact tracing ; statistical modelling . 3 1 Introduction The transmission dynamics of an infectious disease are partially determined by the pathogen’s infectiousness and the course of the transmission ( He et al . , 2020b ; Kutter et al . , 2018 ; Riou and Althaus , 2020 ; Tuite and Fisman , 2020 ; Wallinga and Lipsitch , 2007 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ; Yan , 2008 ; Zhao , 2020a ; Zhao et al . , 2020e ) . The serial interval ( SI ) , which is defined as the time interval between the symptoms onset dates of an infector and of the associated infectee ( Fine , 2003 ; Milwid et al . , 2016 ; Vink et al . , 2014 ; White et al . , 2009 ) , is widely used to measure the duration of the transmission generation . As the most efficient proxy of the generation time ( GT ) ( Wallinga and Teunis , 2004 ) , SI is one of the crucial epidemiological parameters in describing the transmission process as well as the growth patterns of an outbreak ( Champredon and Dushoff , 2015a ; Kenah et al . , 2008 ; Wallinga and Lipsitch , 2007 ; Yan , 2008 ) . As a contagious disease , the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , was firstly reported in 2019 ( Huang et al . , 2020 ; Leung et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2020b ; Parry , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2020c ) , and rapidly spread to over 200 countries and territories , which poses a serious threat to global health . In response to the large - scale COVID - 19 outbreaks , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30 , 2020 ( World Health Organization , 2020 ) , which soon became a pandemic . As of February 14 , 2021 , there have been over 100 million confirmed COVID - 19 cases worldwide with over 2 million associated deaths ( 2021 ) . To date , the transmission process of COVID - 19 has been characterized and reconstructed both empirically and theoretically ( Adam et al . , 2020 ; He et al . , 2020b ; Kwok et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2020b ; Luo et al . , 2020 ; Ren et al . , 2021 ; Tindale et al . , 2020 ; Wu et al . , 2020a ; Xu et al . , 2020 ) . In a number of existing literature , SI is commonly considered following a universal distribution at the population ( or herd ) scale for many well - known respiratory infectious diseases ( Assiri et al . , 2013 ; Cowling et al . , 2009 ; Leung et al . , 2004 ; Vink et al . , 2014 ) , which also occurs for COVID - 19 ( He et al . , 2020b ; Li et al . , 2020b ; Nishiura et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . In other words , SI was considered as a fixed distribution across transmission generations . However , two recent studies reported that SI appears with slight discrepancies across different transmission generations according to the summary statistics at populational scale ( Li et al . , 2020a ; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . Inspiring by their findings , we suspect there may exist a solid difference in the mean SI in consecutive generations in a transmission chain . In this study , we develop a statistical framework to explore the change in the SI across transmission generations after adjusting the impacts of case isolation . For exemplification , we quantify the change in SI by using the COVID - 19 contact tracing surveillance data in Hong Kong . We explore the mechanism that drives the change in SI , and we also demonstrate its effects on shaping the transmission of COVID - 19 . 2 Methods 2 . 1 Conceptualization and statistical parameterization We denote the SI of an infected individual , i . e . , infector , by τ that follows a probability density function ( PDF ) h ( τ ) with mean μ and standard deviation ( SD ) σ . A transmission chain is composed by two consecutive transmission pairs , in which the infectee in the former transmission 4 pair acts as the infector in the latter transmission pair , see Fig 1 . Regarding each case , we name the transmission pair between the infector of this case and himself by ‘former transmission pair’ , and name the transmission pair between this case and his infectee by ‘latter transmission pair’ . As such , for convenience , we name the SI in the former transmission pair by ‘former SI’ and denoted by τ ( F ) , and the SI in the latter transmission pair by ‘latter SI’ and denoted by τ ( L ) . Here , we note that the superscript , i . e . , ‘ ( F ) ’ or ‘ ( L ) ’ , is used merely as a label instead of as a power . We explore the changing patterns in SI across transmission generations . In the same transmission chain , an intuitive statistical relation between τ ( F ) and τ ( L ) in Eqn ( 1 ) , E [ τ ( L ) ] = λ ∙ E [ τ ( F ) ] , ( 1 ) is considered , where E [ ∙ ] denotes the expectation function . The parameter λ is the change ratio between the means of two consecutive SIs , which is a positive constant to be determined . Straightforwardly , there exist iterative changes in mean SI across transmission generations , if λ ≠ 1 , while the mean SI may be a constant , if λ = 1 . Hence , the relation in Eqn ( 1 ) can be examined by checking whether λ = 1 holds under the null hypothesis . 2 . 2 Likelihood - based inference framework With the PDF h ( τ ) for the individual SI , the ( baseline ) likelihood framework , denoted by L 0 , can be formulated in Eqn ( 2 ) . That is , 𝐿 0 ( 𝜆 ) = ∏ 𝑖 [ ℎ ( L ) ( 𝜏 ( L ) 𝑖 │ 𝜆 , 𝜏 ( F ) 𝑖 ) ∙ ℎ ( F ) ( 𝜏 ( F ) 𝑖 │ 𝜆 , 𝜏 ( L ) 𝑖 ) ] ( 2 ) where the subscript i denotes the i - th transmission chain . For h ( L ) ( ∙ | λ , τ ( F ) ) , the mean of h ( L ) is given as μ ( L ) = τ ( F ) ∙ λ according to the relation in Eqn ( 1 ) . By contrast , for h ( F ) ( ∙ | λ , τ ( L ) ) , the mean of h ( F ) is given as μ ( F ) = τ ( L ) / λ . The SD of h ( ∙ ) , i . e . , σ , is modelled as a function of μ . Due to the lack of information about the dispersion of the individual SI , as well as small sample size , we consider three scenarios of σ that cover a wide range of the possible situations . For a given individual infector , they include  scenario ( I ) , a large SD : σ = | μ | , which refers to the scale of the coefficient of variation ( CV ) estimated in previous studies ( Adam et al . , 2020 ; Ali et al . , 2020 ; Du et al . , 2020 ; He et al . , 2020b ; Kwok et al . , 2020 ; Nishiura et al . , 2020 ; Tindale et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ; You et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2020f ) and considered as an upper bound of SD ;  scenario ( II ) , a moderate SD : σ 2 = | μ | , which is assumed having a Poisson - like feature ; and  scenario ( III ) , a small SD : σ = 1 , which is assumed and considered as a lower bound of SD . The script “ ( L ) ” or “ ( F ) ” is omitted here for simply convenience . We remark that , on one hand , for scenarios ( I ) and ( II ) , the SD is depended on the mean SI of the generation , which indicates SD is not same between generations . Since the mean SI shrinks across transmission generations , the SD under these two scenarios will also change . On the other hand , the scenarios ( III ) reflected a condition that SD is fixed across transmission generation . The three scenarios here covered a wide range of SD of SI for COVID - 19 , which should include the most realistic situation . We acknowledge that the information about the SD of individual SI may improve the analysis . As our research target is focusing on the mean SI ( μ ) , the settings in SD will not affect our conclusions . With the mean and SD , the function h ( ∙ ) can be formulated by some widely adopted PDFs . We consider three different PDFs . They are 5  Normal distribution as a representative of symmetric distributions defined on all real numbers ( Ali et al . , 2020 ; Du et al . , 2020 ; Forsberg White and Pagano , 2008 ; Ma et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ; Yang et al . , 2020 ; You et al . , 2020 ) ;  Gumbel distribution as a representative of asymmetric distributions defined on all real numbers ( Ali et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ) ; and  Gamma distribution as a representative of asymmetric distributions defined on positive numbers ( Ali et al . , 2020 ; Cowling et al . , 2009 ; Du et al . , 2020 ; Ferretti et al . , 2020 ; Ganyani et al . , 2020 ; He et al . , 2020b ; Li et al . , 2020b ; Ma et al . , 2020 ; Nishiura et al . , 2020 ; Ren et al . , 2021 ; Tindale et al . , 2020 ; Vink et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ; Zhao , 2020b ; Zhao et al . , 2020f ) . We select the scenario of SD and distribution of h ( ∙ ) according to the fitting performance in terms of the Akaike information criterion with a correction for small sample sizes ( AICc ) . In addition , as pointed out in ( Nishiura et al . , 2020 ) , the baseline likelihood in Eqn ( 2 ) might lead to an underestimation of SI due to the interval - censoring issue . Hence , according to the truncation scheme previously developed in ( Zhao et al . , 2020f ) , which accounts for the effects of each infector’s isolation , we adjust for the truncation bias by an improved likelihood function , L , in Eqn ( 3 ) . We have , 𝐿 ( 𝜆 ) = ∏ 𝑖 [ ℎ ( L ) ( 𝜏 ( L ) 𝑖 │ 𝜆 , 𝜏 ( F ) 𝑖 ) 𝐻 ( L ) ( 𝑑 ( L ) 𝑖 │ 𝜆 , 𝜏 ( F ) 𝑖 ) ∙ ℎ ( F ) ( 𝜏 ( F ) 𝑖 │ 𝜆 , 𝜏 ( L ) 𝑖 ) 𝐻 ( F ) ( 𝑑 ( F ) 𝑖 │ 𝜆 , 𝜏 ( L ) 𝑖 ) ] ( 3 ) where H ( ∙ ) is the cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) of h ( ∙ ) , and the letter d denotes the duration from the onset date of an infector to the person’s isolation date . All other notations are the same as those in Eqn ( 2 ) . The parameter λ is estimated under both truncated and non - truncated schemes by using the maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) . The AICc is employed for model selection . The 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) is calculated by using the profile likelihood estimation framework with the cutoff threshold of a Chi - square quantile ( Cai et al . , 2021 ; Fan and Huang , 2005 ; He et al . , 2020a ; Lin et al . , 2018 ; Zhao et al . , 2020a ) . All analyses are conducted in the R statistical software ( version 3 . 5 . 1 ) , and no specific package is used . 2 . 3 COVID - 19 surveillance data in Hong Kong The COVID - 19 surveillance data are originally released by the Centre for Health Protection ( CHP ) of Hong Kong ( Centre for Health Protection , 2020 ) , and used in ( Adam et al . , 2020 ) previously . According to the data description in ( Adam et al . , 2020 ) , a total of 1038 laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections as of May 7 , 2020 , were initially screened . In Hong Kong , each contact of a confirmed COVID - 19 case , defined as who has prolonged face - to - face interaction with a case , is traced and mandatorily quarantined for 14 days , regardless of symptom appearance . Then , each transmission pair , i . e . , the ‘infector - and - infectee’ pair , can be reconstructed from the contact tracing records . A total of 169 transmission pairs including 27 asymptomatic transmission pairs for either infector or infectee , which are directly collected via https : / / github . com / dcadam / covid - 19 - sse / blob / master / data / transmission _ pairs . csv , are identified for further screening . 6 In this study , we focus on the ( 169 – 27 = ) 142 symptomatic transmission pairs in Hong Kong . We identify the infectee who acts as an infector in other transmission pairs , i . e . , the ‘secondary case’ in Fig 1 , by matching all combinations of the 142 transmission pairs . We reconstructed the transmission chain with 3 generations including primary case , secondary case , and tertiary case , which is illustrated as the ‘secondary case’ in Fig 1 . A total of 21 transmission chains are extracted , and presented in Fig 2 . Since the isolation period of each infector is unavailable , we consider the case confirmation date as a proxy of the isolation starting time with the presumption that the isolation starts immediately after confirmation . Hence , the change ratio of SI , λ , can be estimated from these transmission chain data in Hong Kong by using the analytical framework in Section 2 . 2 . 2 . 4 Sensitivity analysis To evaluate the estimating sensitivity , an alternative formulation , similar to the relationship in Eqn ( 1 ) , is adopted to repeat the estimation with the dataset from Hong Kong . The alternative relationship between the former and latter SIs is formulated in Eqn ( 4 ) . E [ τ ( L ) ] = λ ∙ [ E [ τ ( F ) ] − Τ c ] + Τ c , ( 4 ) where the term Τ c ( ≥ 0 ) indicates the lower bound of the SI as generation increases . Other terms have the same meanings as those in Eqn ( 1 ) . Straightforwardly , Eqn ( 1 ) and Eqn ( 4 ) will be equivalent , if Τ c = 0 . Thus , the intuition of Eqn ( 4 ) is of the same fashion as that of the Eqn ( 1 ) . We estimate both Τ c and λ simultaneously with the likelihood profiles and estimation procedures in Section 2 . 2 . The model selection is conducted referring to the lowest AICc . We check the consistency of the λ estimates , and whether Τ c is significantly larger than 0 . 2 . 5 Exploratory explanation of the mechanisms behind the change in SI In this section , we develop statistical models to explore two possible , but not verified , mechanisms behind the change in SI , their effects in shaping the transmission process , and their reasonability . 2 . 5 . 1 Exploration # 1 : changes in latent period and infectious period In exploration # 1 , we consider a hypothetical scenario that the change in mean GT ( = mean SI ) is an intrinsic feature of the pathogen , which is due to change in latent period and infectious period across cluster generations . Then , according to the classic ‘susceptible - exposed - infectious - removed’ ( SEIR ) framework , where exponential distributions are assumed for most of the epidemiological parameters ( Gatto et al . , 2020 ; Lipsitch et al . , 2003 ; Svensson , 2007 ; Wu et al . , 2020b ; Zhao et al . , 2020b ) , we have X ( k ) + Y ( k ) = E [ τ ( k ) ] , and X ( k + 1 ) + Y ( k + 1 ) = E [ τ ( k + 1 ) ] , ( 5 ) where X ( unit : day ) denotes the mean latent period , and Y ( unit : day ) denotes the mean infectious period . Note that Eqn ( 5 ) originally holds for the relationship among latent period , incubation period and GT ( Svensson , 2007 ) . It can be extended to the situation of SI with the assumption that the infector and infectee have the same distribution for the incubation period , such that GT and SI have the same expectation . The superscript ( k ) is the label of transmission generation rather than a power . This relationship is derived in ( Svensson , 2007 ) theoretically , and adopted in ( Champredon and Dushoff , 2015a ; Gatto et al . , 2020 ; Lipsitch et al . , 2003 ; Wu et al . , 2020b ; Zhao et al . , 2020b ) . When 7 λ < 1 , we assume 0 ≤ X ( k + 1 ) ≤ X ( k ) , and 0 ≤ Y ( k + 1 ) ≤ Y ( k ) for Eqn ( 5 ) . We define 𝜌 ( 𝑘 ) = 𝑌 ( 𝑘 ) ― 𝑌 ( 𝑘 + 1 ) 𝐄 [ 𝜏 ( 𝑘 ) ] ― 𝐄 [ 𝜏 ( 𝑘 + 1 ) ] as the percentage of SI reduction due to the reduction in infectious period . × 100 % We explore the potential effects of the change in SI on the individual reproduction number , R , across transmission generations . Referring to the SEIR framework , the individual reproduction number can be modelled as the product of the mean effective contact rate and the mean infectious period , i . e . , R ( k ) = β ( k ) ∙ Y ( k ) for the infector in the k - th generation in a transmission chain . Here , β ( unit : per day ) denotes the effective contact rate . By fixing β as a constant , we explore the effects of the change in τ on R in the k - th transmission generation . To set up , we fix the mean SI of the infector , E [ τ ( k = 0 ) ] , at 7 . 5 days referring to the estimates from the earliest COVID - 19 data ( Li et al . , 2020b ) , and the mean latent period , X ( k = 0 ) , at 3 . 3 days ( Li et al . , 2020c ; Zhao , 2020b ; Zhao et al . , 2021b ) for the initial , i . e . , 0 - th , generation . Thus , the mean infectious period , Y ( k = 0 ) , is derived at ( 7 . 5 − 3 . 3 = ) 4 . 2 days by using Eqn ( 5 ) , which is in line with the results in literatures ( Kucharski et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2020c ; Wu et al . , 2020b ) . We further fix the initial individual reproduction number , R ( k = 0 ) , at 2 . 2 , which is generally consistent with previous estimates ( Ali et al . , 2020 ; Chinazzi et al . , 2020 ; Gatto et al . , 2020 ; He et al . , 2020b ; Jung et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2020b ; Musa et al . , 2020 ; Ran et al . , 2020 ; Riou and Althaus , 2020 ; Wu et al . , 2020b ; Xu et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2020c ; Zhao et al . , 2020f ) , and also for the situation in Hong Kong ( Cowling et al . , 2020 ) . Then , we fix β = 2 . 2 / 4 . 2 ≈ 0 . 5 individual per day . Thus , the relationship among k , ρ , and R can be solved numerically . 2 . 5 . 2 Exploration # 2 : competition among multiple candidate infectors In exploration # 2 , we consider a statistical mechanism that the shrinkage in SI may be an outcome of a competition among multiple candidate infectors , which was previously pointed out in ( Kenah et al . , 2008 ) . The SI is recorded pairwisely as the duration between onset dates of an infectee and the infector who triggers the infection . In a cluster of cases , contacts are likely to occur in most pairs of infected and susceptible individuals simultaneously . Here , a cluster is defined as a group of cases who are seeded to the same ( traceable ) source of infection . The size of the cluster is determined by the number of cases within the same cluster . For example , 1 seed case without causing further infection would be a cluster of size 1 , and 1 seed case transmits to 3 cases in the first generation , who further transmit to 5 cases in the second generation , would be a cluster of size ( 1 + 3 + 5 = ) 9 . The candidate infector is defined as those cases who contribute to the exposure of an infectee but may or may not trigger the infection eventually . We speculate the competitions among multiple candidate infectors may shorten the SI . For the competition among a total of J candidate infectors for one infectee , the onset time , t , of the infectee who is triggered by the j - th candidate infector follows a PDF denoted by g ( t = t j + τ j ) . Here , t j denotes onset date of the j - th candidate infector , and τ j denotes the candidate SI , if occurs , between the j - th candidate infector and the infectee . The parameter t j is observable from the surveillance data , and thus is considered as a constant . The parameter τ j is modelled as independent and identically distributed ( IID ) random variable following the PDF h ( τ ) as defined in Section 2 . 1 . Hence , the g ( t ) appears a shifted version of h ( τ ) with a shift term of − t j . The candidate infector who triggers the infectee is recognized as the infector . Thus , the observed SI of the infectee is τ j that associates with the smallest ( t j + τ j ) for all indexes j . 8 We simulate this candidate infector competition framework stochastically . To set up , we consider a cluster starting with one seed case whose onset date is day ( or time ) 0 . The PDF h ( τ ) is modelled as a Gamma distribution with mean 5 . 5 and standard deviation ( SD ) 3 . 3 days , which is in line with many existing estimates ( Ferretti et al . , 2020 ; Ganyani et al . , 2020 ; Tindale et al . , 2020 ; Zhao , 2020b ) . With h , the PDF g can also be determined by shifting . For the reproducibility , we restrict the number of offsprings generated by each infector following a Poisson distribution with rate parameter fixed at 2 . 2 , which is consistent to the predefined value of reproduction number ( R ) in Section 2 . 5 . 1 . Alternatively , the Poisson distribution adopted here can be extended to a Negative Binomial distribution to further account for the overdispersion feature in the individual reproduction number , i . e . , superspreading potential ( Adam et al . , 2020 ; Lloyd - Smith et al . , 2005 ; Zhao et al . , 2021a ) . The number of offsprings from the initial seed case , namely number of primary offsprings , is a criterion to identify the superspreading events , and thus is importance to explore its effect in shaping SI across transmission generation . For simplicity , we neglect the isolation in the simulation framework , such that the Poisson rate is fixed at 2 . 2 . Namely , we investigate the theoretical outcomes under an intervention - free scenario . More realistic scenarios can be explored with time - varying values of reproduction number , which can be calculated by using the approach in previous studies empirically ( Ma et al . , 2014 ; Park et al . , 2019 ; Wallinga and Lipsitch , 2007 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . In the model simulation , we record the cluster size in terms of the cumulative number of cases , onset dates of each case , infector of each infectee ( except the initial seed case ) , SI , generation of cases , and number of offsprings for each infector . The generation of cases is traced by the transmission chain linked to the initial seed case , and we defined the generation of initial seed case as generation 0 . For convenience , the transmission generation between a case in generation 0 and another case in generation 1 as the first transmission generation , and thus the index of transmission generation can be ranked subsequently . For each simulation , we extract the SIs from first and second transmission generations , and treat these consecutive SIs as pairs of former and latter SIs that is illustrated in Fig 1 . We generate 30 pairs of former and latter SIs , and conduct the estimation of λ using the framework in Eqn ( 2 ) . We explore the effects of cluster size , number of primary offsprings and generation numbers in changing the scale of SI . 3 Results and discussion For the 21 identified COVID - 19 transmission chains in Hong Kong , the pairs of former and latter SIs are presented in Fig 2 . We report the descriptive statistics as follows . For the former SI , we report a mean of 5 . 4 days , median of 6 . 0 days , interquartile range ( IQR ) between 3 . 0 and 7 . 0 days , 95 % centile from 1 . 5 to 10 . 5 days , 95 % percentile of 8 . 0 days , and a range from 1 . 0 to 13 . 0 days . For the latter SI , we report a mean of 4 . 8 days , median of 4 . 0 days , IQR between 3 . 0 and 7 . 0 days , 95 % centile from 1 . 0 to 9 . 5 days , 95 % percentile of 9 . 0 days , and a range from 1 . 0 to 10 . 0 days . We observe that the mean ( and median ) SI decreases when generation increases , and this finding was reported previously in ( Li et al . , 2020a ; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . With the sample means , we calculate the ratio of latter SI over former SI at ( 4 . 8 / 5 . 4 = ) 0 . 89 , which is roughly the same scale as 0 . 73 in ( Ma et al . , 2020 ) and 0 . 94 or 0 . 75 in ( Li et al . , 2020a ) . Empirically , the pairwise difference of latter SI minus former SI has a mean of −0 . 7 days , median of 0 . 0 day , and IQR between −3 . 0 and 2 . 0 days . 9 The pairwise ratio of latter SI over former SI has a mean of 1 . 1 , median of 1 . 0 , and IQR between 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 . By using the nonparametric bootstrapping approach , the crude change ratio of SI across generations is calculated at 1 . 00 with 95 % CI : ( 0 . 57 , 1 . 43 ) . Considering the theorical probability profile of individual SI in Eqn ( 2 ) , we estimate the λ at 0 . 77 and 95 % CI : ( 0 . 51 , 1 . 16 ) selected with the lowest AICc among all non - truncated scenarios , see Table 1 . For all scenarios in Table 1 , we find that the Gamma distribution with σ 2 = | μ | outperformed against other scenarios in terms of the lowest AICc . As such , we estimate the λ at 0 . 72 and 95 % CI : ( 0 . 54 , 0 . 96 ) , which are considered as the main results . Besides the fitting performance , we also consider the biological feasibility of probability profile in governing the real - world observations of the SI of COVID - 19 . Referring to the previous literatures ( Adam et al . , 2020 ; Ali et al . , 2020 ; Du et al . , 2020 ; Ganyani et al . , 2020 ; Tindale et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ; You et al . , 2020 ; Zhao , 2020b ) , the SI of COVID - 19 might be negative , i . e . , τ < 0 . Although the Gamma distribution outperforms , the negative SI observations cannot be governed by a Gamma - distributed h ( ∙ ) . In this case , the scenario with the second lowest AICc is considered as another main results . As such , we estimate the λ at 0 . 74 and 95 % CI : ( 0 . 61 , 0 . 91 ) with a Gumbel distribution , which is also highlighted in Table 1 . The best fitting performance from Gamma distribution is probably because all our SI observations appear positive , see Fig 2 . We remark that with negative SI observations , Gumbel distribution is likely to yield a better fitting performance than Gamma distribution . Consistently , the estimates of λ using Gamma and Gumbel distributions are almost the same , and significantly less than 1 . Thus , the individual intrinsic SI is likely to shrink when the transmission generation increases with rate at 0 . 72 per generation . Remarkably , we distinguish effective SI and intrinsic SI . The intrinsic SI measure the SI when the effect of control measure is not in place , while the effective SI emphases the SI under the control measure . It is important to reveal the fundamental change of the parameter and associated external factors . According to our truncated likelihood framework in Eqn ( 3 ) , the estimated shrinkage can be understood in regarding the intrinsic SI ( Champredon and Dushoff , 2015b ; Nishiura et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2020f ) , of which the “ distribution depends only on the average infectiousness of an individual ” and the incubation period of secondary case as defined in ( Champredon and Dushoff , 2015a ) . We have adjusted the impacts of case isolation in SI estimating , and thus the shrinkage in intrinsic SI is interpreted as an across - generation feature . The shrinkage in SI is also unlikely due to the effects of other types of nonpharmaceutical interventions ( e . g . , social distancing , facemask , sterilization , suspension of gathering , and city lockdown ) , which may shorten the realized SI as pointed out in ( Ali et al . , 2020 ; Nishiura , 2010 ; Park et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2020d ) , because the decrease in effective transmission rate of each source case is unlikely to affect the mean intrinsic SI estimate . The effective SI is inferred in ( Ali et al . , 2020 ; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , the issue that right censoring due to sampling bias may lead to estimation bias in SI , which is pointed out in recent study ( Park et al . , 2021 ) , may not affect our conclusion because our dataset covers a complete epidemic wave before May 2020 in Hong Kong . We also ignore the possible difference in the incubation periods of infector and infectee , which are considered following the same distribution in ( Ganyani et al . , 2020 ; Tindale et al . , 2020 ) . However , slight changes could occur due to several factors including case definitions , cohort assumptions , and changes in contact tracing strategies , which might impact the SI estimates and need further investigations . 10 Regardless of the number of direct offspring in each generation , the shrinkage in SI implies that the transmission is likely to occur more rapidly since the exposure of each infector . Then , the infectee is more likely exposed before the symptom onset of the infector in the late generations , comparing to the situation in the early generations . In other words , pre - symptomatic transmission may occur more frequently in the late generations . In addition , we find both main estimates of λ are under the scenario ( II ) of individual SI’s SD ( σ ) . Since the SIs from a population may have an SD as in scenario ( I ) , this finding indicates that the SI of a population is more dispersive than the individual SI . For the sensitivity analysis , the relationship in Eqn ( 4 ) is examined . We find that , consistent with the main results , the Gamma - distributed h ( ∙ ) with scenario ( II ) of σ and likelihood truncation outperforms among other scenarios , see Fig 3 . The SI lower bound , Τ c , is estimated at 0 . 0 exactly , which means Eqn ( 4 ) becomes equivalent to Eqn ( 1 ) , and implies relationship in Eqn ( 1 ) holds consistently . We explore the impacts of the shrinkage in SI in shaping the individual reproduction number modelled as exploration # 1 in Section 2 . 5 . 1 . We find that the R decreases when the transmission generations increase , see Fig 4 . With a higher percentage of the reduction in SI due to the reduction in infectious period ( ρ ) , the R may decrease more rapidly . As a geometric sequence , if the absolute value of the common ratio , i . e . , λ , is less than one , the sequence defined in Eqn ( 1 ) will converge . Thus , the mean GT will decrease and approach 0 theoretically , when the number of transmission generations becomes sufficiently large . As such , under exploration # 1 , a discrepancy between the theoretical outcome and the real - world fact occurs as follows . When the GT decreases , the individual R of each infector will also decrease , which leads to an outcome that the transmission of COVID - 19 may vanish after several generations . In contradiction , as a matter of fact , the pandemic of COVID - 19 continuous in many places ( 2021 ) . We note that this discrepancy may imply a restriction of exploration # 1 in explaining the real - world observation . Thus , exploration # 1 is less in favored comparing to exploration # 2 , which will be discussed next . For the suspected candidate infector competition mechanism proposed as exploration # 2 in Section 2 . 5 . 2 , we find the shrinkage in SI is likely occur when the cluster size increases , see Fig 5 , and when the number of offsprings increases , see Fig 6 . Under the mechanism in exploration # 2 , the mean individual reproduction number holds as a constant . In other words , the outbreak maintains with substantial offspring cases in each transmission generation , and thus the discrepancy under exploration # 1 vanishes . Therefore , we consider exploration # 2 as the main discussion , which may be more reasonable than exploration # 1 . The mechanism of competition among multiple potential infectors is supported by previous study , and the findings of the shrinkage in the individual SI in this study provide a real - world evidence , which validates the theoretical framework in ( Kenah et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , the scenario under exploration # 2 would become evident only when there is sufficient number of seed cases serving as sources of infections , e . g . , an outbreak is near to or has passed its peak , and within a cluster of cases and their close contacts . By contrast , under intensive nonpharmaceutical interventions , the infectors are typically isolated and close contact are quarantined timely , the competition among candidate infectors would be difficult to happen . 11 We observe the SI shrinks as generation increases , and approaches a boundary level in the late generations , see Fig 7 . As such , we argue that the alternative relation in Eqn ( 4 ) may be more biologically reasonable , even though the simpler formulation in Eqn ( 1 ) slightly outperforms . We speculate the outperformance of Eqn ( 1 ) is possibly because most transmission chains ( 16 out of 21 ) are the chains of cases from ‘zero - first - second’ generations in each cluster of COVID - 19 cases . This character of our COVID - 19 dataset makes the simple geometric relation in Eqn ( 1 ) an optimal fit to the observations from early generations . In other words , if more SI observations from late generations would be included , Eqn ( 4 ) may replace Eqn ( 1 ) as the optimal relationship . To verify , we repeat the estimation in Section 2 . 4 by merely using the ( 21 – 16 = ) 5 transmission chains that are from late generations , i . e . , secondary , tertiary , or quaternary . In this case , we estimate the Τ c at 1 . 4 days ( data not shown ) , which indicates Eqn ( 4 ) appears more feasible than Eqn ( 1 ) . Hence , The estimate can be benefit from a larger sample size . We remark that the data with more generations observed from each transmission chain will probably improve the estimation of the change in SI across generations . In addition , the simulation results in Fig 7 are considerably limited to several simplified ( but unrealistic ) modelling assumptions , and they include a ‘perfectly mixed’ system , i . e . , everyone contacts all others constantly , the absence of nonpharmaceutical interventions , and SARS - CoV - 2 transmits for infinitely many generations . Under these restrictions , the results in Fig 7 can merely be considered as an ideal scenario , which seldom occurs in the real - world setting . We note the following limitation of our analysis . Although the effects of isolation time were adjusted in the inference framework in Eqn ( 3 ) , the shrinkage of SI might also arise from other artificial factors , e . g . , self - isolation , change in social activities or behaviors due to the awareness of virus circulation , and recalling bias such that short - term events are more precisely memorized , which occurred in the backward contact tracing exercise ( Du et al . , 2020 ) . These potential confounders cannot be fully ruled out in the current analytical framework mainly due to lack of data . Therefore , although exploration # 2 outperforms exploration # 1 , and is supported theoretically ( Kenah et al . , 2008 ) , it cannot guarantee either true causality or a full causal effect even the causality is verified , i . e . , a partial contribution . The nonpharmaceutical interventive strategies ( Fraser et al . , 2004 ) , which can cut off the transmission chain , e . g . , case isolation , quarantine , social distancing , and personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , are thus crucially important to mitigate the cluster size and flattening the epidemic curve . The statistical mechanism in exploration # 2 may be applicable to study the transmission dynamics of other infectious diseases . Future studies on verifying the exploration # 2 , or on exploring other clinical or biological mechanisms that affects the individual SI across transmission generations are desired . 4 Conclusions The mean of individual SI of COVID - 19 is likely to shrink as the transmission generation increases with a threshold as the lower boundary . We speculate that the shrinkage in SI is an outcome of the competition among multiple candidate infectors within the same cluster of cases . The shrinkage in SI may speed up the transmission process , and thus the nonpharmaceutical interventive strategies are crucially important to mitigate the epidemic . 12 Declarations Ethics approval , consent to participate , and consent for publication All data used in this work are publicly available , and thus neither ethical approval nor consent is applicable .

All authors critically read and revised the manuscript , and gave final approval for publication . 26  The COVID - 19 pandemic poses a serious threat to global health , and one of the key epidemiological factors that shape its transmission is serial interval .  We develop a likelihood - based inference framework to model the change in serial interval across transmission generations .  The individual serial interval of COVID - 19 shrinks at a rate of 0 . 72 per generation and 95 % CI : ( 0 . 54 , 0 . 96 ) .  The shrinkage in serial interval may be an outcome of competition among multiple candidate infectors within a cluster of cases .  The nonpharmaceutical interventive strategies are crucially important to mitigate the COVID - 19 epidemic .
