The second formant has one node and antinode more along the tract , the node at the side of the mouth , the antinode at the side of the larynx . These can shift when the cavities are tuned in two different ways for the same vowel , there being many degrees of freedom by the adjustment of lower jaw , tongue , palate and constriction of the pharynx wall , and only a few critical formants for each vowel . : [ The extra node of the second formant will be located somewhere near the soft palate , e . g . at 1000 cps a •t All formants have a node at the larynx , the throat wall thus being the proper place for a wall microphone . quarter - wavelength in free air of 37øC is 8 . 8 cm , with the result that the soft palate lies in a region of relative high pressures and vibrates considerably , the exact location of the node depending on the singing peda - gogical treatment .

THE JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETI r OF AMERICA VOLUME 27 , NUMBER 2 MARCH , 1955 An Analysis of Perceptual Confusions Among Some English Consonants GEORGE A . MILLER AND PATRICIA E . NICELY Lincoln Laboratory , liassa•husetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Ma . * sachusetts ( Received December I , 1954 ) Sixteen English consonants were spoken over voice communication systems with frequency distortion and with random masking noise . The listeners were forced to guess at every sound and a count was made of all the different errors that resulted when one sound was confused with another . With noise or low - pass filtering the confusions fall into consistent patterns , but with high - pass filtering the errors are scattered quite randomly . An articulatory analysis of these 16 consonants provides a system of five articulatory features or " dimen - sions " that serve to characterize and distinguish the different phonemes : voicing , nasality , affrication , duration , and place of articulation . The data indicate that voicing and nasality are little affected and that place is severely affected by low - pass and noisy systems . The indications are that the perception of any one of these five features is relatively independent of the perception of the others , so that it is as if five separate , simple channels were involved rather than a single complex channel . HE over - all effects of noise and of frequency dis - tortion upon the average intelligibility of human speech are by now rather well understood . One limita - tion of the existing studies , however , is that results are given almost exclusively in terms of the articulation score , the percentage of the spoken words that the listener hears correctly . By implication , therefore , all of the listener ' s errors are treated as equivalent and no knowledge of the perceptual confusions is available . The fact is , however , that mistakes are often far from random . A closer look at the problem suggests that we might learn something about speech perception and might even improve communication if we knew what kinds of errors occur and how to avoid the most fre - quent ones . Such was the reasoning that led to the present study . Perhaps the major reason that confusion data are not already available is the cost of collecting them . Every phoneme must have a chance to be confused with every other phoneme and that large number of potential confusions must be tested repeatedly until statistically reliable estimates of all the probabilities are obtained . Such data are obtained from testing programs far more extensive than would be required to evaluate some specific system . In order to reduce the magnitude of the problem to more manageable size , we decided to study a smaller set of phonemes and to explore the potential value of such data within that smaller universe . Since the con - sonants are notoriously confusable and are quite im - portant for intelligibility , we decided to begin with a comparison of 16 consonants : [ p [ , Itl , Ik [ , If I , 101 , Isl , ISl , 1Ol , Idl , [ g [ , I . 1 , I1 , Izl , 131 , Im [ , and Inl - These 16 make up almost three quarters of the con - sonants we utter in normal speech and about 40 percent of all phonemes , vowels included . It was our suspicion that when errors begin to occur in articulation tests , the culprits would usually be found among this set of 16 phoneroes . A further reason for being interested in consonants is that the information - bearing aspects of these sounds are less well understood than is the case for vowels ; we hoped to pick up some clues as to what the important features of these phonemes might be . The major portion of the work to be reported here was done with the aforementioned 16 consonants . However , a number of other , even smaller , experiments were conducted with subsets of those 16 . In general , the results of the smaller studies agree with and support the conclusions of the larger study .

If , instead , we sought a psychological measure of difference as the independent variable , the most basic such measure would surely be the generalization data themselves - apparently rendering the attempt to determine a functional law entirely circular . Invariance in Psychological Space What is sometimes required is not more data or more refined data but a different conception of the problem . Newton arrived at universal laws of motion only by departing from Aristotle ' s and Ptolemy ' s choice of the concretely given earth as the fixed reference and by choosing , instead , an abstractly conceptualized absolute space , with respect to which all objects including the earth move according to the same laws ( 1 ) . And 230 years later , in order to ensure that the laws of physics are invariant for all observers regardless of their own relative motions , Einstein had to replace Newton ' s Euclidean space with an even more abstract four - dimen - sional Riemannian manifold ( 14 ) . Analogously in psychology , a law that is invariant across percep - tual dimensions , modalities , individuals , and species may be attain - \ A Sizes B Lightnesses & C Positions ( in ( circles ) saturations linear array ) 0 o ? ? . . o . 0 0 0 0 0 \ D Sizes & light - \ E Spectral hues 1 F Consonant It \ ~ nesses ( squares ) [ pigeon datal phonemes co ) 0 0 - 0 . . . . . 0 0 0 G .

Twelve gradients of generalization . Measures of generalization between stimuli are plotted against distances between corresponding points in the psychological space that renders the relation most nearly monotonic . Sources of the generalization data ( g ) and the distances ( d ) are as follows . ( A ) g , McGuire ( 33 ) ; d , Shepard ( 7 , 18 ) . ( B ) g , Shepard ( 7 , 17 ) ; d , Shepard ( 7 , 18 ) .

[ See ( 39 ) and the section " Limitations and Proposed Extensions . " ] I318 able only by formulating that law with respect to the appropriate abstract psychological space . The previously troublesome variations in the gradient of generalization might then be attributable to variations in the psychophysical function that , for each individual , maps physical parameter space ( the space whose coordinates include the physical intensity , frequency , and orientation of each stimulus ) into that individual ' s psychological space . If so , a purely psychologi - cal function relating generalization to distance in such a psychologi - cal space might attain invariance . Instead of starting with a physical parameter space , I proposed to start with the generalization data and to ask : Is there an invariant monotonic function whose inverse will uniquely transform those data into numbers interpretable as distances in some appropriate metric space ? The requirement that the resulting numbers approxi - mate distances in a metric space breaks the circularity ( 7 , 15 ) . Thus , in a K - dimensional space , the distances between points within each subset of K + 2 points must satisfy definite conditions , expressible , in the Euclidean case , in terms of certain Cayley - Menger determi - nants ( 16 ) . Moreover , the lower the dimensionality of the space , the stronger these constraints become . In a one - dimensional space , the distances must satisfy the following very strong additivity condition ( 9 , 15 , 17 ) : For each subset of three points , the distance between the two most widely separated points equals the sum of the distances of those two points to the third point that lies between them . The uniqueness of the function that satisfies such constraints is implicit in the following geometrical consequence of those con - straints ( 18 , 19 ) : Provided that the number , n , of points in a space is not too small relative to the number of dimensions of the space , the rank order of the n ( n - 1 ) / 2 distances among those n points permits a close approximation to the distances themselves , up to multiplica - tion by an arbitrary scale factor . Through Monte Carlo investiga - tions I found that for random configurations of ten points in a two - dimensional space , distances inferred from their rank orders had an average correlation with the true distances of 0 . 998 , and that for 45 points , the correlation exceeded 0 . 999 , 999 ( 19 ) . The actual determination of the unknown function ( and , hence , of the associated distances ) implied by a matrix of generalization data is achieved by numerical methods developed by Shepard ( 18 ) and Kruskal ( 20 ) and known as " nonmetric " multidimensional scaling . In a specified type of space , such methods move n points representing the n stimuli ( usually by steepest descent ) until the stationary configuration is achieved that minimizes an explicitly defined measure of departure from a monotonic relation between the generalization measures gy ' and the corresponding distances dij . Configurations can be obtained in spaces with different numbers of dimensions , and even with different metrics , until the most parsimo - nious representation is found for which the residual departure from monotonicity is acceptably small . The plot of the generalization measuresg0 against the distances dij between points in the resulting configuration is interpreted as the gradient of generalization . It is a psychological rather than a psychophysical function because it can be determined in the absence of any physical measurements on the stimuli . Intimations of an Exponential Law For a given set of n stimuli , an appropriate generalization experiment yields , for every ordered pair of these stimuli , an empirical estimate of the probability pi that a response learned to stimulus i is made to stimulus j . The multidimensional scaling method is usually applied to an n x n symmetric matrix of general - ization measures , gi , obtained from such probabilities through a normalization such asgij = [ ( pij pji ) / ( ii ' p ' j ) ) ] 2 , where pii and pj are SCIENCE , VOL . 237 Shepard’s law Wednesday , April 14 , 2010 Morse code Wednesday , April 14 , 2010 450 A .

Distance scaling tends to achieve better compromises in lower dimensions . 2 . INTERACTIVE MDS OPERATION The principal use of MDS conﬁgurations is for visualization . Because conﬁgurations are essentially multivariate data , any MDS system calls for a multivariate data visualization tool . As some of us coauthored the XGobi and GGobi systems for data visualization , it was natural that we chose these as viewing engines ( XGobi : Swayne , Cook , and Buja 1998 ; Buja , Cook , and Swayne 1996 ; GGobi : Swayne , Buja , and Temple Lang 2003 ; Swayne , Temple Lang , Buja , and Cook 2002 ) . In effect , X / GGvis are master programs that create and feed X / GGobi .

Localization is achieved by choosing σ small . In both cases the resulting proximity data are subjected to classical MDS , but in the present framework it is as easy to apply distance MDS as well as nonmetric versions of either that achieve better embeddings by estimating an additional transformation of the dissimilarities . A competing method , Local Linear Embedding ( LLE , Roweis and Saul 2000 ) is con - ceptually unrelated to MDS . A more recent approach is Local MDS ( LMDS , Chen and Buja 2008 ) which modiﬁes the stress function by adding penalties that spread out and ﬂatten manifolds . 1 . 5 A C LA S S I C A L E X A M PLE : T H E R OTH KO PF M O R S E C O D E D ATA For illustration we use as our running example the well - known Rothkopf Morse code data ( 1957 ) , which are to MDS what Fisher’s Iris data are to discriminant analysis . These data originated from an experiment in which inexperienced subjects were exposed to pairs of Morse codes in rapid order , and the subjects had to decide whether the codes in a pair were identical . The data were summarized in a table of confusion rates . Confusion rates are similarity measures because two codes that are often confused are interpreted as “similar” or “close . ” For the conversion of similarities to dissimilarities one could in principle use any monotone decreasing transformation , but we used the following : D 2 i , j = S i , i − 2 S i , j + S j , j . In other words , we interpreted the similarities as inner product data . This yielded all non - negative values because the confusion matrix ( S i , j ) i , j is diagonally dominant ( most iden - tical code pairs are correctly judged ) . Unlike other conversion methods , this one has the desirable property D i , i = 0 . We also symmetrized the data ( see Section 1 . 1 ) . Applying all four scaling methods in k = 2 dimensions produced the conﬁgurations shown in Figure 2 . We decorated the plots with labels and lines to aid interpretation . In particular , we connected groups of codes of the same length , except for codes of length four which we broke up into three groups and a singleton ( “H” ) . We observe that , roughly , the length of the codes increases left to right , and the fraction of dots increases bottom up . Both of these observations agree with the many published accounts ( e . g . , Shepard 1962 ; Kruskal and Wish 1978 , p . 13 ; Borg and Groenen 1997 , p . 59 ) . This interpretation of the axes was achieved by rotating the conﬁgurations ( which is permissible due to rotation invariance of the distances " x i − x j " and inner products # x i , x j $ ) . While we easily obtained interpretable axes with interactive rotations , one usually tries to achieve the same in factor analysis with automated rotation methods such as Varimax . The four scaling methods exhibit signiﬁcant differences . Nonmetric distance scaling produces probably the most satisfying conﬁguration , with the exception of the placement of the codes of length 1 ( “E” and “T” ) . Metric scaling suffers from circular bending but it places “E” and “T” in the most plausible location . The classical scaling methods bend the conﬁgurations in different ways . More problematically , they overlay the codes of length 4 and 5 and invert the placement of the codes of length 1 and 2 , both of which seem to Wednesday , April 14 , 2010 Wednesday , April 14 , 2010 Kruskal Stress D ( x 1 , . . . , x N ) =   ￿ i ￿ = j = 1 . . .
