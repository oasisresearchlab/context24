Gender bias in ( neuro ) science : facts , consequences and solutions Sarah Genon for the Women in Neuroscience Repository ( WINRepo ) Jessica Schrouff , Doris Pischedda , Gregory Fryns , Ana Luisa Pinho , Eliana Vassena , Antonietta Liuzzi , Fabio Ferreira Is there a gender bias in neuroscience ? Histogram in different aspects of neuroscientific academic life over the 3 to 10 past years Bias in most aspects of the research career : Schrouff et al . 2019 - Funding acceptance rate ( Pohlhaus et al . , 2011 ; Kaatz et al . , 2016 ; Sheltzer , 2018 ) - Chances of being hired for tenure - track positions at the same competence level ( Steinpreis et al . , 1999 ) - Reviewing and editorial boards , deciding bodies , etc… ( Helmer et al . , 2017 ) - … Is there a gender bias in neuroscience ? https : / / biaswatchneuro . com / OHBM 2019 Brain Connectivity Workshop Systems Neuroscience Spring School Estimated base rate 2019 Conference Data Does it matter ? • Evolving as a human community • Increase team performance : Diverse teams outperform on innovation , problem - solving , flexibility , and decision - making ( King , 2005 ) • Research community inclusivity improves research representativity : ▪ “We study people like us”  Health research : “white male model” ( e . g . : Dresser , 1992 ) ▪ Future of science and AI : data are biased , so models are ( e . g . : Bolukbasi et al . , 2016 ) How to promote gender diversity ? As an institution ▪ Organize bias training sessions ( Asplund & Welle , 2018 ) ▪ Implement double - blind reviewing when relevant e . g . grant applications , journal papers see e . g . Budden et al . 2008 ▪ Consider gender balance when awarding prizes or grants ( e . g . through tandem nomination ) See e . g . Science Europe 2017 ▪ Implement quotas such as cascading model for hires ( Wallon et al . , 2015 ) ▪ Implement “stop - the - clock” policies for parents ( Flaherty Manchester et al . 2010 ) ▪ Actively collect and share data to define and evaluate new policies How to promote gender diversity ? As an organization ▪ Provide childcare or other family - friendly measures ( Calisi , 2018 ) ▪ Consider gender balance when awarding prizes or fellowships ( e . g . through tandem nomination ) ▪ Implement double - blind reviewing for paper submissions and awards see e . g . Budden et al . 2008 ▪ Require gender - balanced nominations for all organizing committees and reviewer pools - Can be a burden for more visible women ( Vernos , 2012 )  Search for candidates on lists and repositories WINRePo1 www . facebook . com / WiNRepository / - www . winrepo . org - over 1 , 200 profiles - easy search - recommendations Repository for Women in Neuroscience Support the project :  sign up  spread the word  submit recommendations How to promote gender diversity ? As an individual ▪ Be aware of your own and others’ bias ( e . g . Becker et al . , 2011 , Uhlmann & Cohen , 2007 ) ▪ Attend bias training sessions ( Atewologun et al . , 2018 ) ▪ Speak out when observing gender biased events / behaviours and inappropriate conduct ( MeTooSTEM ) ( Bell & Koenig , 2017 ) ▪ Share the wealth ! If declining an opportunity ( e . g . reviewing a manuscript , a collaboration , a talk ) , suggest men and women equally . ▪ Sign up on repositories and encourage women colleagues to do so ▪ Submit recommendations for women scientists ( directly to organizations or on repositories ) Examples of recommendation system www . winrepo . org / list / recommend Progress is visible when we take action ! Discussion Schrouff et al . , 2019 • Does each proposed solution work ? • Work in progress • Not one solution : typically a combination of measures , fitted to the specific audience ( e . g . Chang et al . , 2019 ) . • Important to collect data and evaluate actions’ effects ( e . g . Atewologun et al . , 2018 ; Deschamps et al . , 2018 ; Chang et al . , 2019 ) • Individuals count ! • Be aware of your own bias • Promote diversity in your institution and field of research Discussion Data about diversity in neuroscience : https : / / biaswatchneuro . com / Information about the challenges facing women and minorities in science : Women in Stem Resources http : / / www . sarahrugheimer . com / Women _ in _ STEM _ Resources . html A free online test to track implicit biases : https : / / implicit . harvard . edu / implicit / Some additional resources : https : / / diversesources . org / For gender diversity in policy debates : https : / / brusselsbinder . org / Databases for diversity in sciences : “Information” resources : “Action” resources : https : / / www . embo . org / science - policy / women - in - science / wils - database - of - women - in - life - sciences https : / / www . nexxt . rub . de / https : / / anneslist . net / http : / / www . academia - net . org / # MeTooSTEM : https : / / metoostem . com / https : / / www . winrepo . org / Thank you www . facebook . com / WiNRepositoory @ WINRePo1 You are You can / should Conference organizer Committee chair Recruiter Search for the right women neuroscientist in Winrepo A woman in neuroscience Register on Winrepo A scientist Write recommendations ! ! !
