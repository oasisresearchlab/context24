REVIEW Hallmarks of alternative splicing in cancer S Oltean 1 and DO Bates 2 The immense majority of genes are alternatively spliced and there are many isoforms speciﬁcally associated with cancer progression and metastasis . The splicing pattern of speciﬁc isoforms of numerous genes is altered as cells move through the oncogenic process of gaining proliferative capacity , acquiring angiogenic , invasive , antiapoptotic and survival properties , becoming free from growth factor dependence and growth suppression , altering their metabolism to cope with hypoxia , enabling them to acquire mechanisms of immune escape , and as they move through the epithelial – mesenchymal and mesenchymal – epithelial transitions and metastasis . Each of the ‘hallmarks of cancer’ is associated with a switch in splicing , towards a more aggressive invasive cancer phenotype . The choice of isoforms is regulated by several factors ( signaling molecules , kinases , splicing factors ) currently being identiﬁed systematically by a number of high - throughput , independent and unbiased methodologies . Splicing factors are de - regulated in cancer , and in some cases are themselves oncogenes or pseudo - oncogenes and can contribute to positive feedback loops driving cancer progression . Tumour progression may therefore be associated with a coordinated splicing control , meaning that there is the potential for a relatively small number of splice factors or their regulators to drive multiple oncogenic processes . The understanding of how splicing contributes to the various phenotypic traits acquired by tumours as they progress and metastasise , and in particular how alternative splicing is coordinated , can and is leading to the development of a new class of anticancer therapeutics—the alternative - splicing inhibitors . Oncogene ( 2014 ) 33 , 5311 – 5318 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / onc . 2013 . 533 ; published online 16 December 2013 Keywords : cancer ; hallmarks ; alternative splicing INTRODUCTION Alternative splicing ( AS ) is one of the main engines that drive proteome diversity and it is estimated that up to 94 % of genes are alternatively spliced in humans . 1 , 2 Just as many other cellular processes are modiﬁed during cellular growth , differentiation and tissue development , AS is also affected . In the last few years , a plethora of mRNA isoforms speciﬁc to stages of cellular development and disease , including oncogenesis , have been described . 3 – 6 The molecular mechanisms that determine the choice of particular splicing events associated with these processes , which may be critical in understanding how normal development occurs and how cancers develop and metastasize , are now beginning to be elucidated . During tumour growth and development and during oncogenesis , cells move through various processes as they acquire additional oncogenic properties . These have been summarised by Hanahan and Weinberg in 2000 in papers describing the hallmarks of cancer , updated in 2011 to include eight processes required for tumour development and progression to metastases . 7 , 8 Unlimited proliferation of cells is clearly a requirement for tumour growth , but other processes , such as angiogenesis , immune escape , growth factor self sufﬁciency , invasion and antiapoptotic mechanisms are also acquired by tumours as they progress and metastasise to form threatening malignancies . The mechanisms driving these processes are becoming clearer with the onset of high - throughput proteomic and genomic techniques that allow driver mutations in oncogenes to be identiﬁed for each cancer type , and as more and more de novo human cancers are examined a picture of a co - ordination of the hallmarks of cancer is being put together . However , it is now becoming increasingly clear that AS regulates many of these processes . The importance of studying connections between AS and cancer is underscored by the possibility that some alternatively spliced isoforms drive the oncogenic process and could represent attractive therapeutic targets . Moreover , unique or sets of isoforms could be used as biomarkers of disease progression . For instance , one of the most well - studied splicing factors—the SR protein SRSF1 ( also known as ASF / SF2 or ASF ) —has been demonstrated to be an oncogene 9 and has been linked with regulation of AS of genes representing several the hallmarks of cancer . SRSF1 is a RNA - binding protein with functions in several areas of RNA metabolism : constitutive splicing and AS , non - mediated RNA decay , RNA transport as well as translation 10 – 13 and its role as an oncogene may be due to most or all of its functions . However , it is remarkable that if one looks exclusively at its contribution to AS it is straightforward to ﬁnd examples of SRSF1 - driven splicing isoforms that affect most hallmarks of cancer : ( i ) sustaining proliferative signalling—a recent study has shown that SRSF1 is one of the effectors of EGF - mediated global effects on AS during cell proliferation ; 14 ( ii ) evasion of growth suppressors—SRSF1 regulates expression of the oncogenic cyclin D1b splicing variant through an intron - 4 retention mechanism ; this variant is highly expressed in prostate cancers ; 15 ( iii ) escape from apoptosis— SRSF1 is involved in driving AS from pro - apoptotic to antiapopto - tic variants in several genes including BIN1 , Bim 16 and caspase 9 ; 17 ( iv ) angiogenesis—SRSF1 is one of the main regulators of the pro - and antiangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) isoforms ; 18 and ( v ) invasion—SRSF1 controls overexpression of 1 School of Physiology and Pharmacology , University of Bristol , Bristol , UK and 2 Division of Pre - clinical Oncology , School of Clinical Sciences , University of Nottingham , Queen’s Medical Center , Nottingham , UK .

Of course , just as with other regulators of gene expression , the behaviour of SRSF1 in a certain type of cancer does not extend necessarily to all cancers , but , depending on additional layers of regulation as well as intrinsic and extrinsic signals , it is possible that SRSF1 is a coordinating splicing factor for several hallmark processes in one type of cancer , whereas in another type it may drive primarily one , or possibly a different combination of hallmarks . Other splicing factors may have roles in other cancers and in different contexts , a splicing factor might act in opposite manners—either as an oncogene or as a tumour suppressor . This review will therefore focus on revealing the coordinated splicing regulatory pathways known to underpin the oncogenic process as a model for coordinated splicing networks in altered cell behaviour . ALTERNATIVE SPLICING Pre - mRNA splicing is the process through which introns are removed from the nascent RNA and exons are joined together to form the mature RNA , which is subsequently translated into proteins . The removal of introns is catalysed by a macromolecular ribonucleoprotein complex named the ‘spliceosome’ , which assembles at the borders between introns and exons—the so - called ‘splice junctions’ . Exons may be re - arranged , parts or all of them skipped ; they can mutually exclude each other while parts of introns may be retained in the mature transcript . These processes—collectively known as AS—result in a multitude of different transcripts being produced from the same gene . This further translates into a high diversity of the proteins produced , ampliﬁcation of protein interactions and signalling , with the end result of having greater variety in cell functions . At the RNA level , the process is regulated by cis - acting sequences ( for example , splice sites , exonic or intronic enhancers and silencers ) and interactions with several trans - acting factors—the so - called ‘splice factors’ . In a very similar way to transcription factors , splice factors are tightly regulated and embedded in signalling pathways in the cell , making AS one of the most important levels of post - transcriptional regulation and a major modulator of cell properties and functions . THE HALLMARKS OF CANCER Under the following headings , modelled according to the hallmarks of cancers concept , we aim to present published examples of splicing isoforms that , although not exhaustive , are relevant to the idea that through educated theoretical and experimental design one might be able to identify main themes in AS de - regulation both within and common to the hallmarks processes . A few examples are also presented throughout regarding : ( i ) speciﬁc splice isoforms through which tumours acquire therapeutic resistance ; and ( ii ) splice variants for which the functional / mechanistic role is not characterised yet , but are strongly associated with particular types of cancers and have diagnostic and prognostic values . ENABLING REPLICATIVE IMMORTALITY An essential property of cancer cells is to circumvent the normal cellular senescence process resulting from shortening of telo - meres . Activation of telomerase and high activity is thought to occur in 4 90 % of cancers . 20 Little is known yet about how AS regulates this process ; however , several splicing isoforms of hTERT , an important component of the telomerase activity , have been reported . They result in shorter proteins that are thought to affect the expression and activity of the main enzyme through dominant - negative properties . Abnormal splicing isoforms have been reported in various cancers such as breast cancer , 21 gastric cancer 22 or during lymphoma development . 23 SUSTAINING PROLIFERATIVE SIGNALLING Healthy tissues and organs control very tightly the way cells proliferate through a complex network of signalling pathways responding to growth factors and their receptors . In contrast , tumours are able to grow uncontrollably . This property is acquired through a myriad of abnormal modiﬁcations of these pathways and expression of their messengers and effectors . It is therefore not surprising that the powerful combinatorial effect conferred by AS is hijacked by cancer cells to express preferentially splicing isoforms with functions that promote and maintain proliferation . Examples of common driver mutations in tumours are presented below , in which AS contributes to cancer progression or therapeutic resistance . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinases family and has a central role in cell proliferation and motility through activation by EGF - ligand binding and downstream signalling mediators such as Akt , JAK / STAT or ERK . A typical example of the adaptation of cancer cells through AS manipulation is exempliﬁed by the characterisation of a splice variant that lacks exon 4 ( de4 EGFR ) ; it is present in several cancers ( gliomas , prostate and ovarian cancer ) but not in adjacent normal tissues . 24 The missing exon translates functionally into a receptor that is constitutively active and promotes proliferation . Similarly , AS of BRaf may be critical in cancer and its treatment . BRaf is a kinase controlled by activated Ras and is mutated in 4 50 % of melanomas—BRaf ( V600E ) . Effective inhibitors against mutant BRaf have been developed and are in use in clinic ( for example , vemurafenib ) , but resistance to treatment is an important problem . 25 A recent paper has described both in experimental cell culture models and in patient samples the existence of splice isoforms of BRaf ( V600E ) that lack the Ras binding domain and promotes resistance to vemurafenib . 26 AS can also contribute to the effectiveness of driver mutations in growth factor signalling cascades . KRas is one of the members of the Ras family of GTPases with a central role in cell proliferation , differentiation and migration . Several mutations in KRas have been associated with many cancers ( most prominently colon cancer ) . Interestingly , two splice isoforms that include alternate cassette exon 4 ( KRas 4A and 4B ) are strongly and differentially correlated with several colon cancer properties , for example , left colon location , size of the tumour or histological subtype . 27 Similarly , mutations and deregulated activity of the PTEN tumour suppressor ( a phosphatase essential for regulating the cell cycle ) are described in many cancers . Two splice variants of PTEN , characterised by intron 3 and intron 5 retention , are strongly associated with breast cancer . 28 EVADING GROWTH SUPPRESSORS As important as it is for normal cells to resist and stop signals for abnormal proliferation , it is equally crucial to tightly regulate growth suppressors . The best - known examples in this class of molecules are the tumour suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma protein . p53 is a transcription factor that coordinates cell - cycle arrest in response to many cellular stresses and injuries . Although several splicing isoforms have been described and it is beyond our scope to review all of them , an interesting example is related to another paradigm of hijacking protein function that is , dominant - negative variants . A splice variant of p53 that lacks the ﬁrst 40 amino acids ( D Np53 ) is still able to bind DNA and therefore compete with the wild - type p53 and affect its normal function . 28 Moreover , p53 is Alternative splicing in cancer S Oltean and DO Bates 5312 Oncogene ( 2014 ) 5311 – 5318 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited stabilised by SRSF1 binding to RPL5 / MDM2 ribosomal – protein complex in the cytoplasm , so phosphorylation and nuclear localisation of SRSF1 is likely to lead to p53 degradation and proliferation . 29 A comprehensive analysis of retinoblastoma protein mutations present in cancer revealed 4 15 % of them being represented in splice sites . 30 , 31 APOPTOSIS Probably the most studied hallmark of cancer in relationship with AS so far is the ability to by - pass programmed cell death . Extensive research has focused on two splicing variants of Bcl - x which result from a 5’ - alternative splice site and produce a short isoform ( Bcl - xs ) that is pro - apoptotic and a long one ( Bcl - xl ) that is antiapoptotic . 32 The balance of these two isoforms is affected in a large number of cancer cell lines and human cancer samples . 33 – 35 Mechanistic analysis has identiﬁed molecular processes that regulate the choice of isoforms with characterisation of cis - acting elements , involvement of several splice factors ( for example , hnRNP A1 and H / F , Sam 68 ) as well as involvement of conditions and signalling pathways ( for example , ceramide upregulates Bcl - xs and protein kinase C downregulates the same isoform ) . 36 A common theme that reﬂects the example of Bcl - x seems to be emerging with several apoptosis - related transcripts in which cancer cells manipulate AS to shift expression from pro - to antiapoptotic isoforms . RBM5 , a RNA - binding protein with proper - ties of a splicing factor which is abnormally expressed in lung and breast tumours , regulates Fas receptor exon 6 splicing and results in either the membrane - bound Fas receptor with pro - apoptotic function or the soluble form of the receptor which is antiapop - totic . 37 Part of intron 8 retention results in a splice isoform of caspase 8 ( caspase 8L ) , which has antiapoptotic properties . 38 Exclusion of exons 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 in caspase 9 results in a smaller protein with antiapoptotic functions , reported to be expressed in several cancer cell lines . 39 , 40 The regulation of pro - and anti - apoptotic splice variants is now being elucidated . Caspase 9 exon exclusion is regulated by SRSF1 and SRSF2 ( SC35 ) as well as , interestingly , by the same compound that regulates Bcl - x splicing—ceramide . 40 Moreover , the transcription factor E2F1 and the splicing factor SRSF2 regulate , in a coordinated manner , splicing switches between pro - and anti - apoptotic isoforms of four genes—c - ﬂip , caspase 8 , caspase 9 and Bcl - x . 41 A similar coordinated regulation was uncovered in a study involving splicing control of Bcl - x and Mcl - 1 . 42 An extensive study by the Chabot laboratory ( Universitee de Sherbrooke , Montreal , QC , Canada ) showed that 20 anticancer drugs are able to shift splicing patterns of several apoptotic genes towards promoting apoptosis in several cancer cell lines 42 underscoring the importance of in - depth understanding of coordinated splicing control for therapeutic reasons as well . INDUCING ANGIOGENESIS VEGFs are implicated in almost every form of cancer , where they are the principal angiogenic molecules , 43 and act as principal mediators of metastasis through the lymphatic system . 44 The bioactivity of the VEGF family of ligands and receptors is regulated at the RNA level by AS 45 and they are key candidates for novel therapeutics targeting RNA regulation . 46 In humans , the VEGF family consists of ﬁve ligands and three signalling receptors . The ligands , VEGF - A – D and placental growth factor are all alternatively spliced to form isoforms with differing or , in some cases , unknown function . The most studied family members are VEGF - A isoforms ( angiogenic VEGF xxx and antiangiogenic VEGF xxx b ) , 47 VEGF - C ( three published isoforms , of which only the full length has been studied in any detail ) 48 , 49 and placental growth factor—of which the principal isoform in humans , placental growth factor - 1 , is not present in mouse . 50 The two mutually exclusive alternative splice sites found in the terminal exon 8 of the VEGF - A gene are probably the most well - characterised splice variants contributing to angiogenesis in tumours . One splice variant ( for example , VEGF - A 165 ) is highly angiogenic , and upregulated in tumours ; the other ( for example , . VEGF - A 165 b ) is endogenously expressed in normal tissues and downregulated in a variety of conditions , including colon , renal and prostate cancer , and metastatic melanoma . The alternative splice variants exert opposite effects on tissue and tumour growth due to their opposing effects on angiogenesis , and a number of mechanisms have been identiﬁed that are critical in the regulation of how the gene is spliced in normal epithelial cells , particularly of the eye , 51 the kidney , 52 and in cancer . 53 VEGF AS is altered in a number of cancer types . 47 , 54 – 57 VEGF 165 b was ﬁrst identiﬁed in renal cortex and was notably not present in renal carcinoma . In non - VHL renal cell carcinoma , VEGF is spliced exclusively as the pro - angiogenic forms , whereas in normal renal glomerular epithelial cells there is a balance of approximately 50 : 50 VEGF 165 : VEGF 165 b . 47 VEGF 165 b is also downregulated in prostate cancer , 56 compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia , and VEGF 165 b is downregulated in metastatic , but not non - metastatic melanoma . 57 A preliminary investigation of the expression of splice factor kinases in melanoma cell lines indicates that there is signiﬁcant expression of SRPK1 in melanoma , but no difference between metastatic ( A375 - SM , A2058 ) and non - metastatic cell lines ( A375P , Gammons et al . , unpublished ) . VEGF 165 b has also been shown to be downregulated in neuroblastoma compared with non - malignant ganglioneuroma , and is more upregulated in Myc - N - ampliﬁed neuroblastoma than in non - Myc - N - ampliﬁed neuroblastoma ; however , it is not clear whether this is a correlative or causative association , as there is no direct evidence yet to link Myc - N status with splicing control . 58 In human colorectal cancers , VEGF 165 , but not VEGF 165 b , is upregulated at the mRNA and protein level , and the level of VEGF 165 b downregulation is correlated both with p53 mutation status and with poor prognosis . 59 Interestingly , in colon cancer cell lines there is a progressive switch from VEGF 165 b to VEGF 165 expression through the adenoma – carcinoma sequence . 55 In lung cancer cells , SRSF2 expression driven by E2F1 can switch splicing to the antiangiogenic isoforms , and E2F1 expression is associated with reduced angiogenesis . 53 It therefore appears that in all the cancers so far investigated ( renal , prostate , melanoma , neuroblastoma , colorectal and bladder cancers ) there is a downregulation of VEGF 165 b and / or upregulation of VEGF 165 speciﬁcally indicating a splicing switch . Moreover , in at least two cancer cell lines investigated , HeLa cells and human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H358 , there is no VEGF 165 b expression , but splicing to VEGF 165 b can be induced—by WT1 overexpres - sion 18 and by E2F1 overexpression , respectively . 53 These results indicate that there is activation of the pro - angiogenic splicing mechanism in these cell lines . The mechanisms controlling splicing of exon 8 of the VEGF - A gene have been intensively studied . SR proteins such as SRp55 ( SRSF6 ) , SRSF1 and SRSF2 have been shown to regulate VEGF - A splicing—SRp55 overexpression switches expression to VEGF - A 165 b , and SRSF1 to VEGF - A 165 . 60 Inhibition of SRSF1 nuclear localisation , by blocking its kinase SRPK1 , inhibits VEGF - A proximal splice site choice in exon 8 . 46 Inhibitors of key splicing factors ( SFs ) such as SRSF1 ( for example , IDC78 ) and their kinases SRPK1 / 2 ( for example , SRPIN340 ) and Clk ( TG003 ) have now become available and these can identify the role of splicing factors in health and disease . SRPK1 inhibitors have been shown to block angiogenesis in models of eye disease . 61 Of particular interest is the lack of cytotoxicity of such molecules in adult animals and cells , 62 , 63 as it appears that they do not adversely affect constitutive splicing . 62 , 63 VEGF receptors are also alternatively spliced and can contribute to angiogenesis . There are three signalling receptors , VEGFR1 – 3 , all of which are alternatively spliced , resulting in isoforms that are Alternative splicing in cancer S Oltean and DO Bates 5313 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2014 ) 5311 – 5318 secreted from the cell , and can act as endogenous inhibitors of their ligands . Thus , AS of the VEGFRs can result in escape from growth factor control . Surprisingly , despite being originally identiﬁed almost 16 years ago , 64 the ﬁrst receptor known to be spliced , VEGFR1 has had almost no investigation of its control . In the last two years , it has become clear that jmjd6 through U2AF65 is a regulator of VEGFR1 AS . 65 VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 splicing isoforms have only recently been discovered 66 and nothing is known of their control . Therefore , although the entire family of ligands and receptors have alternative splice variants and they all have differing functions , there is almost nothing known of the splice control for most of these genes . ACTIVATING INVASION AND METASTASIS More than 90 % of cancer - related deaths are due to metastasis , probably the most complex function of cancer cells , which need to be able to leave the primary tumour , intravasate , survive in blood , extravasate and colonise the target tissue . 67 This implies an incredible phenotypic plasticity , which is largely due to a process characterised extensively in the past years , called epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , and the reverse , mesenchymal – epithelial transitions . 68 This complex process is underlined by a myriad of changes in gene expression ; it is not surprising if one ponders how different an epithelial state is from a mesenchymal one . EMT and mesenchymal – epithelial transitions occur normally during embryogenesis and wound healing , but they are hijacked in many of the cancer progression steps , including invasion and angiogenesis . A few transcription factors ( for example , twist , snail , zeb 1 and 2 ) have been shown to be central in orchestrating these numerous changes in gene expression . Though a few splice factors have been linked to EMT ( for example , RBFox2 69 , 70 ) , recently a novel epithelial - speciﬁc splice factor—epithelial splicing regulatory protein ( isoforms 1 and 2 ) ( ESRP ) —has been shown to be a master regulator of AS events induced during EMT . 71 ESRP has been discovered through a screen for splicing regulators 72 of an interesting AS event related to ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 2 ( FGFR2 ) —alternative cassette exon IIIb ( or 8 ) is characteristic to epithelial phenotype and IIIc ( or 9 ) characteristic to mesenchymal cells . 73 – 75 The screen was based on luminescent splicing reporters and the same kind of reporters have been also used in vivo to show that during tumour growth and metastasis cancer cells are able to switch back and forth between epithelial and mesenchymal states , 76 , 77 highlighting the possibility of using splicing events associated with a certain process to understand biological questions . ESRP expression is under the control of several transcription factors , including Snail , one of the main EMT regulators . 78 TGF - b , a major regulator of EMT and EMT - associated transcription factors , has been shown to also regulate ESRP expression . 79 Interestingly , in the TGF - b signalling axis , namely TGF - b receptor II , AS variants have been described to be heterogeneously expressed in prostate cancer cells . 80 Although the list of EMT - related genes that have AS variants associated with cancer progression is very long and described in detail elsewhere , 81 we wish to highlight a few of the most relevant and well - studied events up to date : ( i ) exon 11 skipping of E - cadherin , a cell - to - cell adhesion molecule that is downregulated in EMT , results in a splice variant that is upregulated in several cancers and is inversely correlated with expression of the wild - type variant ; 82 ( ii ) CD44 , a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell migration and invasion , has several variable exons resulting in a multitude of splice isoforms ; 83 ( iii ) an interesting example of a splice isoform used as a signalling mediator instead of the ﬁnal effector is Rac1b , whose expression is stimulated by metalloproteinase - 3 and in turn upregulates Snail and induces EMT ; 84 ( iv ) exon 11 skipping in Ron ( a tyrosine kinase receptor ) results in a speciﬁc isoform ( D Ron ) that confers an increased motility to cancer cells and is upregulated in several types of cancer . 19 Many of these splicing events have been shown to be under the control of SRSF1 . DEREGULATING CELLULAR ENERGETICS A tumour is often compared to an organ or a tissue ; however , the organisation both structurally and functionally is very different from normal tissues . It is therefore not surprising that many aspects of the cellular metabolism are different from physiological states . One such adaptation , described by Warburg , is the way in which cancer cells use glucose . 85 , 86 Under aerobic conditions , normal cells produce energy through oxidative phosphorylation ; when lacking proper oxygen supply , the glycolytic pathway is switched on . Cancer cells , however , have the ability to primarily use glycolysis regardless of the oxygen supply , a process termed as aerobic glycolysis . Though this is much less efﬁcient in terms of energy production , it is thought to be used by tumour cells to produce the intermediates needed to supply the high demand of biosynthesis in the case of proliferating cells . Examples of abnormal expression of splice variants that are advantageous to tumour cell metabolism are found in key metabolic enzymes as well . A well - studied example is that of PKM ( pyruvate kinase ) , which has two splice isoforms , PKM1 and PKM2 , that differ through the mutually exclusive AS of two exons ( 8 and 9 ) . 87 PKM1 is normally expressed in adult life and stimulates oxidative phosphorylation . PKM2 , a promoter of aerobic glycolysis expressed in embryonic development and shutdown in adult cells , is re - expressed in numerous cancers . Extensive regulation of PKM1 and PKM2 isoform ratio in cancers has been unravelled to involve c - Myc pathway and ribonucleoproteins hnRNP A1 , A2 and PTB . 87 Lactic dehydrogenases form a large family of enzymes that metabolise lactic acid ; LDHC has also been shown to be abnormally expressed in many cancers but additionally to have AS tumour - speciﬁc variants that confer catalytic advantage . 88 AVOIDING IMMUNE DESTRUCTION The organism senses tumour cells as highly abnormal phenotypes and activates immune responses and elimination . Tumour cells have developed an incredible arsenal of mechanisms to avoid recognition and destruction by immune cells . A well - known mechanism of immune evasion in tumours is the expression on the surface of tumour cells of unusual HLA molecules—for example , HLA - G , which inhibit immunocompetent cells . HLA - G is not expressed in normal tissues and highly expressed in various tumour types . An added level of advantage is again conferred by AS - HLA - G has several AS isoforms , among which some ( for example , HLA - G1 ) have enhanced function . 89 In line with other examples of splice variants that might give therapeutic advantage is a splice isoform of MHC - I with exon 7 missing ; this stimulates the responses of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and has been shown to be more effective in hampering melanoma growth in mice than the canonical variant . 90 ONCOGENIC SIGNALLING PATHWAYS DRIVING COORDINATED AS A multitude of studies have now established signalling pathways that are aberrantly regulated in cancers . Though much more is known , for instance , about how transcription factors are regulated by different signalling molecules in response to intra - and extracellular stimuli , the literature describing how signals are conveyed to splice factors and the splicing machinery is growing rapidly . It is envisaged that this will point out more ways to modulate AS for therapeutic purposes . Far from trying to be comprehensive , we exemplify here some pathways that regulate AS in cancers . A recent paper describes probably the most detailed involvement of a signalling pathway in regulating AS . 14 Alternative splicing in cancer S Oltean and DO Bates 5314 Oncogene ( 2014 ) 5311 – 5318 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Fu et al . have shown that EGFR signals primarily through Akt ( and not JAK / STAT or ERK ) to modulate AS of a large number of genes ; they show that SRPK1 is a major downstream transducer of Akt signals and its activation promotes phosphorylation of several SR proteins that act as splicing factors . However , it is likely that each cancer will have its own driver of AS . PI3 - kinase , for instance , has been shown to regulate AS targets representative of several hallmarks—for example , Rac1b in colorectal tumour cells , with the involvement of SRSF1 91 and caspase 9 in non - small cell lung carcinoma cells through SRSF1 . 17 TGF - b has not only been linked to regulation of the master splice factor that drives EMT—ESRP 79 , but also to modulation of the ratio between pro - and anti - angiogenic VEGF isoforms . 60 The Wnt pathway , considered to be the most frequently activated oncogenic pathway in colorectal cancers , regulates SRPK1 and SRSF1 , 92 while c - myc modulates splicing of PKM through PTB and hnRNP A1 , A2 , 87 as well as expression of SRSF1 by binding to its promoter . 93 In a study on 67 samples from hepatocellular carcinoma patients , a positive correlation was found between activated Ras signalling and an AS variant of the transcription factor KLF6 ; 94 experiments in cell culture showed that the KLF6 splice variant acts as a dominant - negative inhibitor and promotes cell proliferation . One of the most highly studied signalling pathways driving cancer growth and progression is the activation of Ras , often through direct activating mutations ( for example , K - Ras ) , but also through hyperactivation due to either mutation in upstream activators . AS can provide a mechanism whereby oncogenic signalling activation can be permanently switched on in the absence of mutations . For instance , work in Philip Sharp’s laboratory ( Cambridge , MA , USA ) has shown that Ras drives AS of CD44 through a positive feedback loop in which the CD44v6 variant is generated , which in turn potentiates Ras signalling . 95 This provides a mechanism whereby once splicing is switched it can be maintained through an autoregulatory route that does not require mutation—hence providing a driver for cancer growth that can be mediated entirely by induction of environmental signal transduction initiation . COORDINATION OF ALTERNATIVE SPLICING IN CANCER Although all the above mechanisms of regulation of AS can contribute to cancer processes , one of the key goals in the ﬁeld may be to identify whether the mechanisms that regulate different cancer - promoting splicing events are common . For instance , is VEGF splicing controlled by the same fundamental mechanisms that regulate AS of metabolism - associated genes like PKM1 / 2 , antiapoptotic genes such as Bcl - xl and the other genes that act in a concerted way to increase tumour progression ? Interestingly , the VEGF family of proteins have been shown to be involved in seven of the eight hallmarks ( excepting unlimited proliferative potential ) , and alternative splice variants of VEGF , VEGFR1 , VEGFR2 , VEGFR3 and VEGF - C may contribute to all of these . It may therefore now be possible to determine whether there are key fundamental splicing control mechanisms that are responsible for tumour progression . We and others have identiﬁed some of the principal pathways regulating splicing in cancer ( SRPK1 - SRSF1 , FOX2 , hnRNPK , Sam68 and hnRNPA1 ) . 46 , 60 These ﬁve splicing proteins , particularly FOX2 and SRSF1 , appear to be likely candidates involved in multiple cancer - controlling complexes . Of particular interest is that the regulation of these proteins by SRPK1 , for instance , in the case of SRSF1 , could affect multiple hallmarks of cancer ( Figure 1 ) — impacting angiogenesis , invasion , growth factor insensitivity and antiapoptosis , and itself could be activated by sustained growth factor signalling . Thus , an activating mutation in the EGFR2 could drive multiple hallmarks through activation of splicing events . It is also possible that these may also be coordinated at yet another level as there are common element ( s ) to the spliceosome that are put together during cancer progression that may regulate splicing . As described above , the spliceosome is the complex of proteins that regulate and carry out AS . It forms a unique complex for each splicing event by the recruitment of multiple proteins with differing activation states , and small nuclear RNA particles ( snRNPs ) that can recognise RNA sequences and initiate the splicing process . Although some proteins act as RNA - binding proteins to identify speciﬁc sequences , others are recruited to the polymerase complex during the transcriptional initiation linking transcription with splicing , with additional proteins transducing the signals from the cell to the spliceosome . Another class of proteins , deep in the spliceosome , act to hold speciﬁc combina - tions of splice proteins together , and these protein – protein binding proteins can give speciﬁcity to the system by controlling the balance of splice factors recruited to the polymerase complex . These protein – protein binding proteins have been used to pull out core tumour splice proteins . One such protein is FBP21 , a WW domain protein that has been shown to bind to multiple components of the splice complex . 96 These proteins can bind multiple splicing factors , and disruption of this complex either by chemical dissociation or by gene knockdown can alter the splicing of proteins involved in cancer progression . This results in a network of splicing regulatory molecules , linked through transcription factors to the RNA polymerase , to place a regulatory complex of RNA and protein – protein binding proteins together . 97 The upregulation or activation of such pathways could provide a mechanism through which regulated control of splicing could coordinately control the splicing of multiple genes , all to switch splicing in a pro - growth and pro - remodelling paradigm . Some of these putative core tumour splice proteins have been identiﬁed in silico using protein – protein network interactions , some in experimental paradigms , whereby each RNA binding splice factor is used as a bait to pull out proteins that interact with it directly , and then examine the known protein interaction domains through bioinformatic searches .

In addition , regulators of those splice factors have multiple effects across hallmarks and are themselves regulated by activating mutations driving speciﬁc hallmarks . In this example , activated EGFR signalling would drive SRPK1 , which would then drive SRSF1 phosphorylation and impact on four of the hallmarks . Alternative splicing in cancer S Oltean and DO Bates 5315 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2014 ) 5311 – 5318 cancer genomes , generation of stratiﬁed medicines that can target individual mutations within cancers and the explosion of biomarkers for honing cancer treatments to vulnerable patients . Most of this work has been done without considering the myriad of diversity open to the cancer cell by oncogenic pathways that regulate AS . One challenge in the next decade will be to understand the cancer ‘spliceome’ , to pin down core mutations or driver pathways that regulate multiple downstream effectors through common splicing patterns and ultimately to develop novel therapies that act by targeting those pinch points in the splicing regulatory pathway that enable multiple hallmarks of cancer to be inhibited . This last goal requires us to identify the hallmarks of AS in cancer , and then develop new medicines that can target those new hallmarks .
