Punctate PPKs are characterized by circumscribed hyperkeratotic lesions on palms and soles with considerable heterogeneity . In 18 families with autosomal dominant punctate PPK ( OMIM # 148600 ) , we report heterozygous loss - of - function mutations in AAGAB , encoding alpha - and gamma - adaptin binding protein p34 , at a Address for correspondence : Professor Irwin McLean , Dermatology and Genetic Medicine , Colleges of Life Sciences and Medicine , Dentistry & Nursing , University of Dundee , Dow Street , Dundee DD1 5EH , UK , w . h . i . mclean @ dundee . ac . uk .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s previously linked locus on 15q22 . p34 , a cytosolic protein with a Rab - like GTPase domain , was shown to bind both clathrin adaptor protein complexes , indicative of a role in membrane traffic . Ultrastucturally , lesional epidermis showed abnormalities in intracellular vesicle biology . Immunohistochemistry showed hyperproliferation within the punctate lesions . Knockdown of p34 in keratinocytes led to increased cell division , which was linked to greatly increased epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation . We hypothesize that p34 deficiency may impair endocytic recycling of growth factor receptors such as EGFR , leading to increased signaling and proliferation . Palmoplantar keratoderma ( PPK ) describes a group of hereditary skin disorders characterized by thickening ( hyperkeratosis ) of the palm and sole epidermis 1 . Historically , PPKs have been classified according to the pattern of lesions ( diffuse , focal , punctate , striate ) , as well as histopathologic changes ( epidermolytic , non - epidermolytic , porokeratotic ) . Molecular genetics now allows for improved classification , diagnosis and personalized medicine approaches to treatment . Three distinct types of inherited punctate PPK are recognized by OMIM 2 . These are : PPKP1 ( also known as the Buschke - Fischer - Brauer type , OMIM # 148600 ) , mapped to 15q22 Ref . 4 - 6 ; PPKP2 ( porokeratotic type , OMIM # 175860 ) , not yet mapped ; and PPKP3 ( also known as acrokeratoelastoidosis , OMIM # 101850 ) , where preliminary linkage suggests a possible locus on 2p25 - p12 Ref . 7 . An additional locus was identified at 8q24 . 13 - 8q24 . 21 in two Chinese families whose phenotype resembles PPKP1 clinically and histologically 8 . Here we studied a collection of 18 kindreds with PPKP1 from Scotland , Ireland , Japan and Tunisia , 11 of which had a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In our PPKP1 case collection , there was considerable phenotypic variation ( Figure 1 ) . In all families , onset was typically during the first to second decades of life , with the appearance of small circumscribed lesions on palms and soles . These consistently increase in number with advancing age and later coalesce to form larger lesions . In some families , lesions remained subtle ( Figure 1a & b ) , whereas in other kindreds , the phenotype , resembling HPV - induced papilloma - like lesions , was much more severe , painful and debilitating ( Figure 1c & d ) . Histology of lesional palmar epidermis from 3 unrelated kindreds – Families 1 , 11 and 15 – all showed very similar findings of a well - defined central epidermal depression associated with hypergranulosis and a prominent layer of overlying orthokeratosis ( Figure 1e ) . Immunohistochemical staining for cell proliferation marker Ki67 showed continuous staining of the basal cell ( proliferative ) compartment of the epidermis beneath the hyperkeratotic lesions ( Figure 1f ) , indicative of a hyperproliferative form of hyperkeratosis rather than a retention hyperkeratosis due to defective desquamation . Microsatellite linkage to the previously reported 15q22 locus was observed in a large Tunisian kindred originating from Saudi Arabia ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , with a maximum 2 - point lod score of 8 . 18 at θ = 0 obtained with D15S983 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The family was reported previously 9 . A 6 . 24 Mb critical interval was defined by visible recombination with markers D15S993 ( proximal ) and D15S977 ( distal ) containing 80 RefSeq genes . This locus overlaps the previously reported intervals for PPKP1 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . In parallel , the proband in Family 1 ( of Scottish ancestry ) was subjected to whole exome sequencing . Of 28 , 513 SNPs identified , we elected to concentrate on loss - of - function variants located within the critical interval defined by our linkage data and that previously reported . Of 106 unique “stop - gained” SNPs in the exome dataset , only 3 SNPs , all heterozygous in the proband , were located on chromosome 15 ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Two were located well outside the interval : a known SNP rs57809907 predicting p . E417X in DYX1C1 ; and a second previously unreported variant of unknown consequence predicting p . L439X in GABRG3 . The remaining variant , c . 481C > T , predicting p . R161X in AAGAB fell within our linkage interval and that initially reported 5 , but was just outside the Pohler et al . Page 2 Nat Genet .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s interval reported in a Chinese kindred 6 . This variant was absent from current dbSNP and 1000Genomes datasets . The mutation was confirmed by conventional sequencing and co - segregated with the PPKP1 phenotype in Family 1 ( Supplementary Fig . 3a & b ) . By conventional sequencing , a second loss - of - function mutation , c . 348 _ 349del , was identified and found to fully co - segregate in the linked kindred and two additional Tunisian families ( Supplementary Fig . 3c & d ) . Sequencing of the remaining 16 families revealed a total of 8 mutations in AAGAB ( 2 nonsense ; 5 frameshift and 1 splice site mutation ) , as detailed in Supplementary Table 4 . AAGAB , consisting of 10 exons spanning 53 , 708 bp of genomic DNA , encodes alpha - and gamma - adaptin binding protein p34 , identified from a yeast 2 - hybrid screen using a subunit of the AP - 1 adaptor protein complex as bait 10 . The positions of the mutations in relation to the p34 protein organization are shown in Figure 2 . By quantitative RT - PCR , we confirmed that p34 is expressed at broadly comparable levels in skin , HeLa cells , primary epidermal keratinocytes and the commonly used keratinocyte cell line HaCaT 11 ( Figure 3a ) . By QRT - PCR , we also showed that p34 message is very widely expressed across tissues , including skin ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Two independent siRNAs were developed that showed near - complete knockdown of p34 protein in HaCaT cells ( Figure 3b ) . Treatment of HaCaT cells with either of these potent siRNAs resulted in an approximately 2 - fold increase in cell counts over time ( Figure 3c ) , thus mirroring the increased epidermal proliferation observed in lesional epidermis ( Figure 1f ) . The coating of clathrin - coated vesicles consists of clathrin and adaptor complexes , both of which have to be recruited to the appropriate membrane from the cytoplasm 12 , 13 . The two most abundant types of adaptor protein complexes are AP - 1 , which is responsible for sorting proteins between the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and endosomes , and AP - 2 , which is responsible for sorting proteins at the plasma membrane . Both are heterotypic complexes with AP - 1 containing a γ - adaptin subunit and AP - 2 containing an α - adaptin subunit . Although cDNAs encoding p34 were the predominant species of clone from the original yeast 2 - hybrid screen 10 , difficulties in obtaining specific antibodies meant that further biochemical confirmation of these protein - protein interactions were not presented . Here , using two independent antibodies to p34 made in - house , we confirm by immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting that this protein indeed interacts with both AP - 1 and AP - 2 complexes in the cytosol ( Figure 4a ) . Cytosolic localization was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and using both N - and C - terminal GFP - tagged p34 constructs ( Figure 4b ) , although C - terminal tagging also led to some nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein . Cell fractionation studies showed that p34 is found in the cytosol but not in membrane or clathrin - coated vesicle fractions in HeLa cells ( Figure 4c ) . Near - complete siRNA knockdown of p34 ( Figure 4d ) did not lead to an overt change in the plasma membrane or TGN localization of AP - 2 or AP - 1 , respectively ( Figure 4e ) . Neither AP - 1 nor AP - 2 co - localized with N - or C - terminal GFP fusions of p34 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Essentially identical diffuse cytoplasmic localization data were obtained in the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT ( not shown ) . Overall , these data confirm that p34 is a cytosolic protein that binds to AP - 1 and AP - 2 , however , p34 does not follow these protein complexes into their membrane - associated vesicle populations on intracellular membranes or at the plasma membrane , respectively . This is consistent with a possible chaperone role , as previously suggested 10 . For example , p34 might either prevent soluble clathrin from assembling with soluble adaptor complexes in the cytosol ; p34 might be involved in vesicle uncoating ; or this protein might aid recruitment of soluble adaptors to membranes 10 . Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of a GTPase domain , which is most closely related to the Rab superfamily of vesicular trafficking proteins ( Figure 2a ; Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . It is not known if this GTPase domain is functional . If so , this may be indicative of a role in active transport of cytosolic adaptor complexes rather than a more passive - acting chaperone function 14 . Pohler et al . Page 3 Nat Genet .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s Ultrastructural analysis of lesional plantar skin revealed mild acanthosis , a reduction in the granular cell layer and compact orthokeratosis ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . In basal keratinocytes ( Figure 5 ) , there was a large increase in the number of small vesicles close to the cell membrane and prominent dilatation of the Golgi apparatus ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . These ultrastructural features are consistent with a vesicle transport defect . We hypothesized that a possible mechanism whereby perturbation of vesicle trafficking could lead to increased epidermal proliferation might involve recycling of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGFR is known to undergo a process of rapid turnover – a process that requires a number of sorting steps including clathrin - and AP - 2 - dependent endocytosis 15 , 16 . Internalized ligand - bound EGFR is either shuttled to late endosomes / lysosomes for degradation or into recycling endosomes , where , following removal of the bound ligand and dephosphorylation , the receptor is returned to the plasma membrane via vesicle fusion . Knockdown of p34 in HaCaT cells led to a modest ~ 2 . 5 - fold increase in EGFR mRNA levels as determined by QRT - PCR ( data not shown ) , however , a > 10 - fold increase in EGFR total protein expression was seen by western blot ( Figure 6a ) , consistent with decreased EGFR turnover . Importantly , phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine - 992 , indicating active EGFR signaling 17 , was increased > 20 - fold ( Figure 6b ) . The regulation of EGFR signaling via clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a complex process involving Rab proteins 15 , dynamin 18 , AP - 2 , the Grb2 adaptor protein , and multiple mechanisms relating to post - translational modification of the receptor itself 19 . Disruption of EGFR endocytosis by knockdown of the motor protein dynamin has been shown to produce decreased protein turnover with increased EGFR signaling 18 , very similar to what we observed here by knockdown of p34 . Here , using a combination of genetic linkage and whole exome sequencing , we have identified a gene for the autosomal dominant form of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma previously linked to 15q22 Ref . 5 , 6 , 9 , known as PPKP1 ( OMIM # 148600 ) . The causative gene , AAGAB , encodes alpha - and gamma - adaptin binding protein p34 Ref . 10 . AP - 2 is known to be involved in EGFR endocytosis 19 and we confirm here that p34 binds cytosolic AP - 2 ( Figure 4 ) and show that p34 deficiency increases epidermal cell proliferation ( Figure 1f & Figure 3 ) . Overall , p34 appears to play a hitherto unrecognized role in the control of cell division , possibly by contributing to normal endocytotic recycling of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR 15 , 16 , 18 , 19 . Other genes involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking have been linked to inherited skin disease where hyperkeratosis and / or keratoderma form part of the phenotypic constellation . This includes SNAP29 in cerebral dysgenesis , neuropathy , ichthyosis , and keratoderma ( CEDNIK syndrome ) 20 and VPS33B in arthrogryposis , renal dysfunction , and cholestasis ( ARC syndrome ) 21 , both of which encode proteins required for vesicle membrane fusion in the epidermis and other tissues . Moreover , loss - of - function mutations in AP1S1 , which encodes the small σ 1A subunit of the AP - 1 complex , have been shown to cause the recessive neurocutaneous disorder MEDNIK ( mental retardation , enteropathy , deafness , peripheral neuropathy , ichthyosis , and keratodermia ) 22 . Similarly , defects in multiple proteins involved in melanosome transport and fusion lead to the pigmentation disorder Griscelli syndrome 23 and mutations in the AP - 3 subunit protein β 3A have been linked to Hermansky - Pudlak syndrome type 2 , which consists of oculocutaneous albinism and other features 24 . Thus , a growing number of genes involved in vesicle transport have been linked to genetic skin disease , plus or minus extra - cutaneous phenotypes . Disruption of EGFR signaling is a feature of neoplasia . There are anecdotal reports of cancer occurring in association with punctate PPK families 25 , however , without genetic testing we cannot say that the p34 gene was involved in those cases . Although a few cases of cancer Pohler et al . Page 4 Nat Genet . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 November 21 . E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s were reported in the larger families studied here , we did not observe co - segregation with the p34 mutations and so any causal link remains unproven . It remains unclear why haploinsufficiency for this widely expressed protein leads to a phenotype limited to palm and sole epidermis , although this is not unusual in hereditary skin disease , e . g . haploinsufficiency for the desmosomal proteins desmoplakin and desmoglein - 1 Ref . 26 , 27 , or keratin 1 Ref . 28 , all of which are structural proteins expressed throughout the epidermis , lead to striate palmoplantar keratoderma 29 . Another unanswered question relates to why the hyperkeratotic lesions are focal . These lesions are late - onset , appearing in the first or second decades of life , and increase in number with increasing age . This might be explained by a “second hit” mutation in AAGAB and so we examined this by sequencing the gene using genomic DNA derived from microdissected lesional tissue from more than one patient . This revealed neither loss - of - heterozygosity nor a second compound heterozygous p34 mutation ( data not shown ) . Immunohistochemistry was also attempted , however , neither the in - house nor commercial p34 antibodies available gave a signal on fixed tissue . A further possibility is the occurrence of a second somatic mutation in a gene other than AAGAB . In conclusion , this study expands the molecular diagnostic repertoire for keratodermas and reveals that the AP - 1 and AP - 2 associated protein p34 is involved in control of epidermal cell division . Online Methods Affected individuals and phenotypes Individuals from 18 apparently unrelated families presented with PPK at dermatology clinics in Scotland , Ireland , Japan and Tunisia . Clinical examination and histological analysis of affected persons was consistent with a diagnosis of the Buschke - Fischer - Brauer type of punctate PPK ( PPKP1 ; OMIM reference number 148600 ) 2 . In severely affected cases , where keratoderma resembled plantar warts , presence of human papilloma virus was excluded in the clinical work - up . EDTA blood samples were obtained from the patients with written informed consent and Institutional Ethics Committee approval that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles . DNA was extracted following standard procedures . Linkage analysis Microsatellite genotypes were generated for members of Family 15 using standard protocols . Lod scores were calculated using FASTLINK , assuming a mutant allele frequency of 1 in 50 , 000 30 , 31 . The lod scores were re - calculated using a 10 % chance of non - penetrance because of difficulties obtaining a definitive clinical ascertainment in some individuals in Family 15 ( the family reside in a remote mountainous area of Tunisia ) . Exome sequencing Exome enrichment was performed using the Agilent SureSelect 50 Mb exome enrichment system ( Agilent UK , Wokingham , UK ) , using the protocol for Applied Biosystems SOLiD ( Protocol version 1 . 0 , May 2010 ) , followed by sequencing on the ABI SOLiD platform ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City CA ) , giving an average sequencing depth of > 30x across the exome . Next generation sequencing and SNP calling was performed by The East Anglian Sequencing and Informatics Hub ( EASIH ; http : / / www . easih . ac . uk ) . Pohler et al . Page 5 Nat Genet .

Immunohistochemical staining Ki67 for the cell proliferation marker Ki67 was performed using polyclonal antibody HPA000451 ( Sigma - Aldrich , Poole , UK ) . Mutation analysis of AAGAB gene The individual exons of AAGAB were amplified by PCR using the genomic primers listed in Supplementary Table 5 and the following cycling conditions : One cycle of 94°C for 5 min ; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s , 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min ; and 1 final extension at 72°C for 5 min . Cell culture HaCaT keratinocytes were maintained in a monolayer in 5 % CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , Invitrogen , Paisley , UK ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) . Normal human keratinocytes were obtained from CELLnTECH and cultured in the defined growth medium CnT57 ( TCS Cellworks Ltd , Buckingham , UK ) . HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 2mM L - glutamine , 50 units / ml penicillin and 50 μ g / ml streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Reverse transcriptase PCR Total RNA was extracted from cultured HaCaT cells and primary keratinocytes using an RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen , Crawley , UK ) . 1 μ g of RNA was reverse transcribed using AMV Reverse Transcriptase ( Promega , Southampton , UK ) and oligo ( dT ) 15 ( Roche Diagnostics , Welwyn Garden City , UK ) . 1 μ l of reaction mix was used in subsequent PCR using Expand High Fidelity PCR buffer containing 1 . 5mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 5 units of High Fidelity DNA Polymerase ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Primers AAGAB5intFor and AAGAB8intRev ( see Supplementary Table 5 ) were used to amplify a 292 bp fragment using the following program : one cycle of 94°C for 5 min ; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s , 52°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s ; 72°C for 5 min . Isolation of RNA and gene expression analysis RNA was isolated from abdominal skin , primary keratinocytes , HaCaT and HeLa cells using an RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen ) and the RNA was treated with RNase - Free DNase to remove any contaminating genomic DNA . 1 μ g of each was reversed transcribed using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . 1 μ l of reaction were used in quantitative PCR using Perfecta qPCR ToughMix™ , ROX™ ( Quanta Biosciences ) on a 7900HT Fast Real - Time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) . Taqman® Gene Expression Assays ( Life Technologies ) for AAGAB ( part number Hs01027607 _ m1 ) and GAPDH ( part number 4310884E ) were used as per manufacturer’s recommendations . Multiple tissue expression analysis A cDNA clone was generated to act as a standard , as follows : cDNA generated following reverse transcription of HaCaT RNA was used as template for amplification of a 940 bp AAGAB cDNA fragment using the primers P34clone1 and P34clone2 ( see Supplementary Table 5 ) . The cDNA was cloned as an EcoR I – Hind III fragment into pcDNA™3 . 1 ( − ) / myc - HisA ( Life Technologies ) . A normalized cDNA panel from 48 different human tissues ( Origene Technologies , Inc . , Maryland , USA ) was quantified using Taqman® Gene Expression Assay Hs01027607 _ m1 ( Life Technologies ) . The standard used in this assay was plasmid DNA encoding wild type AAGAB . The standard curve was calculated using the formulae described by Applied Biosystems . Pohler et al . Page 6 Nat Genet .

The sequences of the siRNAs used were AAGAB1239 UGU AAG AGA GUG AGG AAU A and AAGAB2164 GGA AAG UAC UGC AAA UAA A . Non - specific control siRNA ( NSC4 ) sequence ( a scrambled bacterial lacZ sequence ) was UAG CGA CUA AAC ACA UCA AUU’ . 1 . 2 × 10 5 HaCaT cells were added to wells of a 6 well dish containing DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS and transfected with siRNAs at a final concentration of 5 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were incubated for 72 hours or 96 hours before harvesting for RNA extraction and protein isolation or for the cell proliferation analysis . Cell proliferation analysis HaCaT cells were treated with siRNAs as above and incubated for 96 hours . Cells were washed with PBS then detached from the dishes using 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA . Counts of viable cells ( trypan - blue staining ) were obtained using a hemocytometer . AAGAB p34 antibodies Two affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies were made in - house ( J . H . group ) , designated p34 - 1 and p34 - 2 , using GST - fusion protein consisting of residues 142 - 315 ( C - terminus ) of rat p34 ( 85 % identical and 91 % similar to human p34 ) . These antibodies were used for the HeLa cell experiments ( western and immunofluorescence ) . For the HaCaT cell experiments ( W . H . I . M . group ) , rabbit anti - AAGAB polyclonal antibody was used ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Immunofluorescence and western blotting of HeLa cells was repeated using the Sigma - Aldrich antibody with very similar results ( W . H . I . M . group , data not shown ) . Similarly , western blotting and immunofluorescence of HaCaT cells was repeated using p34 - 2 with similar results ( W . H . I . M . group , data not shown ) . Western blotting of HaCaT lysates and EGFR quantification Cells were rinsed in ice - cold PBS then lyzed in SDS lysis buffer ( 1 % SDS , 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 137 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 2 mM EDTA ) plus protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 25 U / ml Benzonase ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) , incubating at room temperature for 10 min with agitation . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g for 10min at 4°C then protein concentrations determined using Bio - Rad Protein Assay ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hemel Hempsted , UK ) . For each sample , 10 μ g of total protein were separated on NuPAGE 4 - 12 % Bis - Tris polyacrylamide gels ( Invitrogen ) in MOPS buffer then blotted onto HyBond - C Extra ( GE Healthcare , Amersham , UK ) . Membranes were probed with 1 : 1000 dilution of the appropriate primary antibody ( rabbit anti - AAGAB ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , rabbit anti - EGFR ( Cell Signaling Technologies , Beverly MA ) , or 1 : 10000 dilution mouse anti - beta - actin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , then 1 : 1000 dilution of goat anti - rabbit - HRP or rabbit anti - mouse - HRP ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) as the secondary antibody . Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate ( Millipore , Watford , UK ) was used for visualization . For detection of phospho - EGFR , blots were blocked in 3 % BSA in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( PBST ) and 10mM beta - glycerophosphate for 1h at room temperature then incubated overnight in 1 / 1000 dilution of phospho - EGF receptor ( Tyr - 992 ) antibody ( Cell Signalling Technology ) in PBST containing 10 mM beta - glycerophosphate at 4°C . Blots were washed in 3 changes of PBST containing 10mM beta - glycerophosphate then incubated in 1 / 1000 dilution of goat anti - rabbit HRP ( DAKO ) in PBST plus 10 mM beta - glycerophosphate for 1 h at room temperature . Following washing as before , blots were developed using ECL . For detection of beta - actin , blots were blocked and antibodies were diluted in 5 % non - fat milk in PBST under the same conditions as above . A dilution of 1 / 10 , 000 was used for the anti - actin Pohler et al . Page 7 Nat Genet . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 November 21 .

Quantification of protein bands on blots was done using a LI - COR Odyssey infra - red imaging system . HeLa cell transfection Transfection of HeLa cells with siRNAs was achieved with Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer’s instructions , using 25 mM siRNA and incubating for 72 h . Knockdown of p34 was achieved using an siGENOME SMARTpool ( # M - 0159891 ) and control knockdowns were performed with a non - targeting siRNA ( # D - 001810 - 10 ) , both ( Thermo - Fisher , Epsom , UK ) . Transient transfections with GFP - tagged plasmid DNA was achieved using HeLa Monster transfection reagent ( Cambridge Bioscience , Cambridge , UK ) following the manufacturer’s instructions and transfecting 48 h prior to imaging . For immunofluorescence , cells were grown on glass bottom coverslips ( Mat Tek , Ashland MA ) , fixed in 3 % formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . The cells were imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope using a Zeiss Plan Achromat 63x oil immersion objective , a Hamamatsu ORCA - ER2 camera and Improvision Openlab software ( Perkin - Elmer , Cambridge , UK ) . Western blot , immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation in HeLa cells These were performed with antibodies raised in - house including p34 ( p34 - 1 , p34 - 2 ) , AP - 2 α , AP - 1 γ , clathrin heavy chain 10 . Antibody P34 - 2 was used to detect p34 unless otherwise specified . N - and C - terminally tagged p34 were constructed from rat cDNA 10 ( note that human and rat AP - 1 γ , share 99 % amino acid identity ) by PCR amplification and cloned in - frame into pEGFP - N3 ( p34GFP ) or pEGFP - C1 ( GFPp34 ; Takara Bio Europe / Clontech , Saint - Germain - en - Laye , France ) using Hind III and Kpn I restriction sites . The sequence of both constructs was verified by Sanger sequence analysis . Immunoprecipitation and clathrin - coated vesicle isolation in HeLa cell extracts For immunoprecipitation , cells were lyzed in PBS containing 1 % IGEPAL ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , cleared of debris by centrifugation and antibody - protein complexes captured using protein - A Sepharose ( Pharmacia , Milton Keynes , UK ) . The samples were then analyzed by PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting . Blots were probed with various antibodies followed by ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System ( GE Healthcare ) . Control CCV - enriched fractions were prepared as described previously 32 , except the final pelleting step was performed at 86 , 900 × g RCFmax ( 40 , 000 rpm , TLA - 110 ) for 30 min to improve yield . Ultrastructural analysis Skin biopsy specimens were cut into small pieces ( of < 1 mm 3 ) and fixed in half - strength Karnovsky fixative for 4 hours at room temperature . After washing in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , the samples were immersed in 1 . 3 % aqueous osmium tetroxide ( TAAB Laboratories , Berkshire , UK ) for 2 hours , followed by incubation in 2 % uranyl acetate ( Bio - Rad ) , and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series , and then embedded in epoxy resin via propylene oxide ( TAAB Laboratories ) . Ultra - thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope ( Philips , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) .

Clinical and histological features of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma ( a ) The palms of the proband in PPKP1 Family 1 show numerous small , hard , slightly indented hyperkeratotic lesions ( arrow ; see inset ) , which typically appear around age 10 and increase in number throughout life . ( b ) On the soles , lesions tend to coalesce at pressure points and so the presentation can resemble a focal form of keratoderma . ( c & d ) In some cases , the phenotype is much more severe , as seen here in the proband from Family 15 . ( e ) This H & E stained section shows a punch sample of skin incorporating a well defined central epidermal depression associated with hypergranulosis and a prominent layer of overlying orthokeratosis . Scale bar = 500 μ m . ( f ) The proliferation marker Ki67 shows an increase in the numbers of keratinocytes in cell cycle within the floor of the epidermal depression ( arrowheads ) compared to perilesional epidermis ( arrow ) .

AAGAB is expressed in skin and keratinocytes and its depletion leads to increased cell numbers over time ( a ) QRT - PCR showed that AAGAB mRNA is expressed in skin and is present at broadly comparable levels in HeLa cells , primary epidermal keratinocytes and the epidermal keratinocyte cell line HaCaT . Conventional RT - PCR showed expression in palmoplantar epidermis comparable to abdominal skin ( data not shown ) . ( b ) Western blotting shows that two independent siRNAs ( designated 1239 and 2164 ) potently knocked down p34 expression in HaCaT cells . Non - specific control siRNA = NSC4 ( inverted lacZ sequence ) . ( c ) AAGAB knockdown by either siRNA leads to an approximate 2 - fold increase in HaCaT cell division at 96 hours post - transfection . Similar data were seen at early time - points ( not shown ) .

Note the association of both AP - 1 and AP - 2 adaptor complexes with p34 . ( b ) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either C - terminally ( p34GFP ) or N - terminally ( GFPp34 ) GFP - tagged p34 constructs . Both constructs show a mainly cytosolic localization and this is consistent with the staining pattern ( albeit faint ) observed using an antibody against p34 in either transfected or untransfected cells ( # ) . ( c ) HeLa lysates were subjected to fractionation into cytosol , membrane , and clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) fractions , and then Western blotted for clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) , AP - 1 and p34 . Note that p34 is found principally in the cytosolic fraction and is virtually undetectable in membrane or CCV fractions in which AP - 1 and CHC are enriched . ( * = cross reacting band ) ( d ) HeLa cells were treated with siRNA to knock down expression of p34 ( kd ) , and western blotted for clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) and p34 ( * = cross reacting band ) . Note the efficient knockdown of p34 ( > 95 % ) . ( e ) Localization of AP - 1 and AP - 2 visualized by immunofluorescence following knock down of p34 ( kd ) .
