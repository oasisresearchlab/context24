Received 24 August , 2016 ; Accepted 26 September , 2016 Analogical reasoning is both an innate ability and a basic learning mechanism that can be improved . In classrooms , it is an important tool used by teachers , especially when explaining difficult or abstract issues . In addition to its use in all aspects of our lives , analogical reasoning is commonly used in textbooks . This research examines the extent to which analogies are used in high school science textbooks , the subjects of the examination being high school physics , chemistry , and biology course textbooks used by students between 14 and 17 years of age . A total of 15 textbooks ( four biology books , five physics books , and six chemistry books ) were reviewed . Ninety - two analogies were identified in these books . These analogies were classified based on a scheme developed by Curtis and Reigeluth . Findings are discussed in the context of previous related studies . Key words : Analogy use , science education , secondary education , science textbooks , meaningful learning , cognitive science . INTRODUCTION Meaningful learning is directly related to students’ ability to establish and integrate new and relevant existing knowledge ( Ausubel 1980 ; Novak 1998 ) . In this sense , analogies have potential to aid in understanding of new knowledge by highlighting similarities between existing known concepts ( the analog ) and new information ( the target ) . For this reason , analogies can be efficient tools for meaningful learning . On the nature of analogies , Gentner ( 1989 ) comments , ―the analogy conveys that a relational system in the target domain matches one in the base domain‖ . Base domain refers to existing knowledge . As an example , the analogy of a continuous train operating on a closed - loop track can facilitate students’ understanding of the movement of electric current in a torch bulb serial circuit ( Figure 1 , Dupin and Johsua , 1989 ) . Passengers travelling from one point to another ( analog ) are likened to electrons ( target ) . This analogy aims to help students comprehend that electric current is not consumed . According to Venville and Treagust ( 1996 ) , an analogy is a process of identifying similarities and differences between two objects or processes . Its purpose is to explain and name unknown cases via already known ones . This is called ―analogical mapping‖ by Gentner ( 1998 ) , and can be schematized as shown in Figure 2 . Gentner ( 1998 ) describes analogy as follows : Analogy is ubiquitous in cognitive science . First , in the E - mail : suleyman . akcay @ gmail . com .

Analogical mapping of base and target domains ( adapted from Wilbers and Dult , 2006 ) . study of learning , analogies are important in the transfer of knowledge and inferences across different concepts , situations , or domains . Second , analogies are often used in…reasoning . Third , analogies can serve as mental models for understanding a new domain ( p . 107 ) . Analogical reasoning is a basic , common learning mechanism used as early as infancy ( Goswami , 1992 , 2008 ) . Scientists have also benefitted from the use of analogies , as they are superior reasoning methods . Many scientific discoveries have been achieved with the help of analogical reasoning ( Harrison and Treagust , 2006 ) . Analogies used in an active manner can be integral to learning because they have the potential to activate already known concepts ( Duit , 1991 ; Glynn , 1991 ; Spiro , 1988 ) . Teachers find some specific analogies both efficient and useful . Examples of analogies used by teachers include the car analogy , which explains the importance of a balanced and healthy diet , and the genetic cookbook analogy , which explains DNA ( Wormeli 2009 ) . Students of many ages benefit from analogies , which assist them in understanding , visualizing , and remembering new concepts ( Orgill and Bodner , 2007 ) . Analogies are used to promote understanding in disciplines such as science ( Harrison and Treagust , 2000a ) , mathematics ( Richland et al . , 2004 ) , music ( Stollak and Alexander , 1998 ) , language education ( Hulshof and Verloop , 2002 ) , and art education ( Casakin and Goldschmidt , 1999 ) . The positive effects of analogies on comprehension and retention have been identified with regard to topics including molecules and atoms ( Harrison and Treagust , 2000a ) , electrical circuits ( Chiu and Lin , 2005 ) , genetics ( Baker and Lawson , 2001 ) , geology ( Blake , 2004 ) , chemical dissociation ( Çalık et al . , 2009 ) , protein synthesis ( Pittman , 1999 ) , chaotic systems in physics ( Duit et al . , 2001 ) , structure and properties of matter ( Kobal et al . , 2014 ) , enzymes ( Atav et al . , 2004 ) , and electrical current ( Aykutlu and Şen , 2011 ) . While highlighting the indispensable role of analogies in explaining theoretical or abstract concepts , Lawson ( 1993 ) argues for the necessity of analogical statements in learning subjects such as atomic structure , which students find difficult to grasp directly . Analogies can thus play a central role in restructuring students’ conceptual frameworks ( Duit 1991 ; Vosniadou 1994 ) . According to Sutton ( 1992 ) , the use of technical terms could lead to confusion and difficulty in students’ learning of scientific concepts . To avoid this , analogical expressions or explanations , which make use of students’ existing knowledge , should be used to simplify the cognitive processes involved in learning new material . Venville and Treagust ( 1996 ) evaluated and classified the roles of analogies in the learning process into four main categories . The first category is the sense maker or advance organizer ; it refers to analogies that provide an overview of a subject . The second category is the memory aid , which refers to analogies that contribute to retention of learning . The third category , transformer , refers to analogies with the ability to transfer knowledge from knowns ( analogs ) to unknowns ( targets ) . The final category is that of the motivator , in which analogies raise students’ interest in a subject or course . However , although analogies can be important tools for understanding , they may also lead to misunderstandings and , therefore , they should be constructed properly in order to avoid this . To construct the best analogy , comparable and incomparable features of the analogs and targets should be interpreted clearly ( Spiro , 1988 ) . Clarifying analogies in this way enriches them and makes them more effective ( Duit et al . , 2001 ; Glynn et al . , 1989 ; Harrison and Treagust , 2006 ; Iding , 1997 ) . For example , an analogy drawn between the eye and a camera can be powerful . Images recorded on the film in the camera can be thought of as similar to images formed on the retina of the eye and transmitted to the brain . A camera lens cap’s protective function can be likened to the eyelid’s protection of the cornea . However , the analogy breaks down at the following points : while cameras are sensitive to very bright light , the eye can adapt itself to both bright and dim light ; and while cameras produce permanent single images , the eyes produce multiple , non - permanent images ( Harrison and Treagust , 2006 ) . It is difficult to predict precisely when analogies will add to confusion and when they will contribute to under - standing ( Curtis and Reigeluth 1984 ) . In classrooms , controlling this is the teacher’s responsibility ( Dagher , 1995 ; Nashon , 1994 ; Newton and Newton , 1995 ) . In fact , different types of analogical models have been developed to aid teachers in using analogies for teaching . Glynn ( 1991 ) developed and suggested the six - step Teaching - with - Analogies ( TWA ) model , and Treagust et al . ( 1998 ) introduced the Focus , Action , Reflection ( FAR ) model . Teachers are more successful in adapting existing analogies to specific cases than they are in generating analogies spontaneously . They also have difficulty generating enriched analogies . Accordingly , teachers require an extensive repertoire of analogies ( Harrison 2001 ; Treagust et al . 1992 ) . Textbooks can be considered key components of this repertoire . They are the most basic and accessible sources of knowledge for students , and they play a critical role in every stage of the learning processes of science classes . Moreover , teachers use textbooks significantly when planning the curriculum and determining their pedagogical strategies ( Sánchez and Valcarcel 1999 ; Souza and Porto 2012 ) . However , teachers often find textbooks too general and outdated . They may , in these cases , use textbooks Akçay 1843 merely as a source for analogies ( Mastrilli , 1997 ) , and thus the characteristics of analogies in textbooks can impact teaching strategies themselves . Additionally , according to Else et al . ( 2008 ) , although students play an active part in employing and interpreting existing analogies in all their disciplines’ curricula , they are incapable of generating analogies themselves . Given this , textbooks are primary sources for existing analogies used in teaching . According to Orgill and Bodner ( 2006 ) , textbooks have the potential advantage of providing students with clearer and more extended analogies . Classification of analogies Analogies in textbooks and their related issues have been the subject of many studies ( Curtis and Reigeluth , 1984 ; Çalık and Kaya , 2012 ; de Posada , 1999 ; Demirci Güler et al . , 2008 ; Giora , 1993 ; Glynn and Takahashi , 1998 ; Harrison , 2001 ; Iding , 1997 ; Orgill and Bodner , 2006 ; Thiele and Treagust , 1994 ; Thiele and Treagust , 1995 ) . However , only a few of these studies have specifically classified analogies . Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) examined 26 science textbooks and classified analogies into six categories . Newton ( 2003 ) took the first five of these categories into consideration ; Thiele and Treagust ( 1994 ) added three additional categories ; and Orgill and Bodner ( 2006 ) expanded the original six categories to ten . Several studies have also examined analogies in Turkish textbooks in particular , at both elementary and secondary school levels ( Çalık and Kaya , 2012 ; Demirci Güler et al . , 2008 ; Dikmenli , 2010 ; Toprak and Pekmez , 2011 ; Yener , 2012 ) . In these studies , the secondary level books were taken from specific branches of science ( for example , biology , physics , or chemistry ) . METHODOLOGY Research questions In this study , a relatively large number of high school science textbooks were analysed . Our research questions were : RQ 1 : How often are analogies used in secondary science education textbooks in Turkey ? RQ 2 : Which types of analogies are used ? RQ 3 : In which areas are analogies used frequently ? Since textbooks are teaching materials prepared in parallel with the curriculum , they can be regarded as parts of the curriculum . Data analysed in this study was collected from three research groups using similar analogical classification systems . This international comparison adds value to the study . Document analysis strategies were conducted based on a qualitative research paradigm . Fifteen accessible textbooks for secondary science education courses ( physics , chemistry , biology ) were reviewed , all of which were selected by the Ministry of National Education ( MONE ) for use in the 2013 - 2014 school year in 1844 Educ .

Analogical statements in the books were identified ; these statements were then classified based on the scheme developed by Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) . Three experts in the field of analogical research ( two with 12 years of experience , one with 18 years of experience ) performed classification of the analogies identified by this research . Before conducting classification , the experts were introduced to Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) system . The experts made their classifications independently ; level of consistency among the experts was then determined by comparing their classifications with those of the researcher . A reliability analysis was conducted using the following formula : Reliability = agreement / agreement + disagreement x 100 ( Miles and Huberman , 1994 ) The consistency rate was found to be at least 92 . 39 % ( Table 1 ) . Miles and Huberman ( 1994 ) consider a study reliable if the consistency rate among two or more different field assessors ( experts ) is greater than or equal to 90 % . Examined textbooks Turkey has a centralized education system : teachers must follow a national curriculum in formal education . They are therefore unable to determine their curriculum themselves . Science education at the primary level is presented in courses under the combined category of science and technology , and at the secondary level ( 9th grade to 12th grade ) through courses under the separate categories of physics , chemistry , and biology . Schools in Turkey select the textbooks to be used during the school year from among those textbooks approved by the MONE . The textbooks examined in the present study were those chosen by the MONE for use in the 2013 - 2014 school year . According to 2014 data , approximately 5 . 5 million students in Turkey continue their formal studies at the secondary level . Twenty - four percent of these students attend open institutions , and 75 . 9 % attend public and private institutions ( MONE , 2014 ) . The textbooks examined were used by approximately 4 million students from private and public educational institutions in Turkey . Some textbooks were also produced by independent publishers . Details of the textbooks examined can be found in Table 2 . The first five of the six categories developed by Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) were used in this research : 1 . Analogical relationship : Structural ( S ) , Functional ( F ) , or Both ( S & F ) . Three possible relational categories of analogical relationship can occur . A . S : Parallels are drawn between appearance , physical organization , and / or structures . B . F : Parallels are drawn with the way something behaves , functions , and / or operates . C . S & F : Both structural and functional parallels are drawn . 2 . Presentational format : Verbal ( V ) , Pictorial ( P ) , or Pictorial - Verbal ( P - V ) . A . V : Analogies can be represented in the text in verbal form , whereby the relationship is explained in words . B . P : Analogies can be represented in the text in pictorial form , whereby the relationship is explained in pictures only . C . P - V : Analogies can be represented by pictures accompanied by words . 3 . Content condition : Concrete to Concrete ( C - C ) , Abstract to Abstract ( A - A ) , or Concrete to Abstract ( C - A ) . The actual content that is chosen to create the analog and target may be categorized in a variety of ways . Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) mention three possible combinations . A . C - C : Both the analog and the target are of a concrete nature . B . A - A : Both the analog and the target are of an abstract nature . C . C - A : The analog is of a concrete nature but the target is of an abstract nature . Theoretically , there is also a fourth category , Abstract to Concrete ( A - C ) . However , analogies aim to support understanding of difficult abstract concepts by linking them to concrete ones . Perhaps for this reason , A - C analogies were not encountered in the present study , nor were they included in that of Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) . 4 . Position in text : Advance Organizer ( AO ) , Embedded Activator ( EA ) , or Post Synthesizer ( PS ) ; A . AO : Analogies are used at the beginning of a unit . B . EA : Analogies are used to explain a subject requiring additional interpretation within a unit . C . PS : Analogies are presented at the end of the unit in a summarizing capacity . 5 . Level of enrichment : Simple ( S ) , Enriched ( En ) , or Extended ( Ex ) ; In this classification scheme , the boundaries of the analogy and its similarities with the target were considered . A . S : Only a similarity statement is made between the analog and the target , with no further explanation of this similarity provided . For example , ―Expansion of the universe after the Big Bang is like a balloon being blown up , ‖ or ―The DNA molecule is shaped like a twisted ladder . ‖ B . En : Further explanation of the similarity between an analog and a target are given . For example , ―Activation energy is like a hill because you have to add energy to the reacting substances to start the reaction‖ ( Harrison and Treagust , 2006 ) . C . Ex : Mixtures of S and En analogies ; limitations are put on the similarities between an analog and a target , or both common and uncommon features of the analog and target are explained . The aforementioned analogy between an eye and a camera is an example of an analogy in the Ex category .

Level of enrichment Most of the analogies in the secondary level textbooks examined were in the S enrichment category . Twenty analogies ( 21 . 7 % ) were classified as En , and four ( 4 . 3 % ) were classified as Ex . DISCUSSION Analogies can affect the attractiveness and fluency of textbooks ( Orgill and Bodner , 2006 ) . Developing Akçay 1847 analogies and keeping them up to date can increase the effectiveness of education , particularly in countries with centralized systems such as Turkey . According to Orgill and Bodner ( 2006 ) , textbooks have the potential to aid learning outside the classroom as well as inside . However , while teachers can correct erroneous inferences and interpretations of analogies in the classroom , analogies in textbooks may lead to mis - understanding or misinterpretation outside the classroom where the teacher is not present . These types of misunderstandings or misinterpretations can be avoided by enriching analogies—that is , by providing details on the extent and limitations of specific analogies . In Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) study of textbooks in the USA , most analogies were identified as belonging to the En class ( 81 . 0 % ) ; in the present study of Turkish textbooks , most analogies were identified as belonging to the S class ( 73 . 9 % ) . Very few Ex analogies ( 4 . 4 % ; see Tables 5 and 6 ) were identified . The textbooks examined in this study were used by nearly 4 million students of public and private educational institutions . Therefore , it may be important to develop and continually update the analogies used in textbooks , increasing their active use and improving the understanding of students in Turkey and similar countries . Other studies conducted in Turkey have found that both prospective teachers and existing academic staff lack knowledge on the nature and use of analogies ( Beyazıt , 2011 ; Güneş et al . , 2004 ) . No studies on the status of teachers in this situation have yet been encountered ; this topic should be examined in future research . Recent studies of analogy have focused on students’ generation of their own analogies ( Pittman , 1999 ; Kobal et al . , 2014 ; Kılıç , 2009 ) . In experiments in which students generate their own analogies as substitutes for existing analogies , no meaningful differences in learning have been found ( Kılıç , 2009 ; Kobal et al . , 2014 ) . Many studies do , however , report meaningful changes in teaching practices and progress in overcoming mis - conceptions through use of existing analogies ( Atav et al . , 2004 ; Aykutlu and Şen , 2011 ; Kayhan , 2009 ; Kılıç , 2009 ; Kobal et al . , 2014 ; Şendur et al . , 2008 ) . These results indicate that existing analogies have the potential to contribute greatly to teaching . Course textbooks are one of the most important resources for existing analogies . Students are successful in using and interpreting existing analogies , yet have difficulties generating analogies themselves ( Orgill and Bodner , 2006 ; Else et al . , 2008 ) . Teachers use existing analogies in classrooms as well , and have difficulties generating new well - developed analogies ( Oliva et al . , 2007 ) . Accordingly , teachers must have comprehensive repertoires of analogy , including tools such as course textbooks . Textbooks are also beneficial in that they present students with straightforward analogies outside of the 1848 Educ . Res . Rev . Table 5 .

According to Harrison and Treagust ( 2000b ) , modelling , which is the essence of scientific study and thinking , possesses an essentially analogical structure . These authors argue that model - based thinking and model - based science are inevitable components of learning . Past research has suggested that analogical reasoning processes are not acquired abilities . On the contrary , it appears that analogical thinking and related knowledge transfer processes are innate abilities . Although adults’ and children’s analogical comparison abilities are different , it is apparent that analogical reasoning pro - cesses are used at every age . Analogical reasoning abilities develop by themselves ; even without guidance , children exhibit behaviours that suggest the use of analogical knowledge transfer processes . Moreover , the occurrence of spontaneous analogical transfer in children increases when they face problems repeatedly ( Leech et al . , 2008 ) . We can thus conclude that analogical reasoning abilities begin to emerge during childhood and develop over an individual’s lifespan . These abilities require support in order to develop properly . Textbooks may contribute this support in formal teaching situations . In addition , science fiction books may also contribute to the development of analogical thinking . Teachers require knowledge of analogies that are pre - existing and have well - determined limits ( Harrison and de Jong , 2005 ; Mastrilli , 1997 ; Treagust et al . , 1992 ) . The most accessible resource with which to meet this need is that of textbooks . Nowadays , textbooks are often widely available as e - books or digital internet files , and they maintain their standing as reliable , widely accessible sources of information in classrooms . Conclusion In terms of analogical relationships , the data in this study align with the results of Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) study on high school textbooks . F analogies were found to be the dominant type across textbooks from all three scientific disciplines . Conversely , Newton ( 2003 ) study of primary education textbooks found that 65 . 2 % were S analogies . As Newton ( 2003 ) stated , this shows that as students get older , the analogies they encounter tend to grow more functional in structure . According to Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) , a purely structural analogy focuses on a unique similarity between an analog and a target . However , the number of differences between an analog and a target is likely also high . Therefore , purely structural analogies may be weak . Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) suggested that functional analogies tend to be used to teach complex and abstract subjects . The functional analogy established by Newton ( 2000 ) between the human brain and a computer , for example , could assist students already familiar with computers to understand functional brain processes . Although the brain does not look like a computer and may not be organized like one , brains and computers nevertheless have some functions in common : Target 1 : Encodes information from the senses for processing Analogy 1 : Encodes incoming data for processing Target 2 : Holds and processes information in working memory Analogy 2 : Holds and processes data in random access memory ( RAM ) Target 3 : Stores information for later recall in long - term memory Analogy 3 : Stores information for later recall on a hard disk drive ( HDD ) Target 4 : Communicates outcomes of processing ( e . g . , by speech or writing ) Analogy 4 : Communicates outcomes of processing ( e . g . , on screen or by printer ) ( Newton , 2000 ) The number of S & F analogies found in this study is more than double the number found by Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ; also see Table 5 ) . According to Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) , S & F analogies are more comprehensive and therefore more powerful in terms of expression . It can thus be said that analogies in Turkish high school science textbooks are powerful in terms of their analogic relationships . The results of the three previous studies , as depicted in Table 5 , show that the number of analogies per textbook at the secondary education level tends to be larger than that at the primary level . This result may be explained by the fact that analogies are usually used to teach abstract and complex subjects , and as children move from primary to secondary education , the topics they learn become more complex and abstract . In terms of presentational format , V analogy ratios are Akçay 1849 found to be in accordance with the data from Curtis and Reigeluth’s ( 1984 ) study . The ratio of P - V analogies is found to be twice that found by Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) . P analogies were not found in any of the three studies described in Table 5 . According to Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) , the V presentational format may be sufficient for teaching analogical relationships . However , the P - V format is preferable for students at lower levels . This suggests that high school science textbooks in Turkey may be targeted toward students at lower levels . The data roughly confirm the findings of Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) with respect to content condition . However , in high school science textbooks in Turkey , the number of C - C analogies is remarkably high ( Table 5 ) . The excess of C - C analogies found in this research may have been distributed among the C - A and A - A classes in previous studies . The number of AO analogies found was significantly lower than that found by Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) , whereas the ratio of EA analogies was similar . Newton ( 2003 ) , who examined primary education textbooks , found only EA analogies . The number of PS analogies found was significantly higher than that of Curtis and Reigeluth ( 1984 ) . AO and EA analogies seem to be the best located analogies . In this respect , the analogies in Turkish high school science textbooks seem to be lower effective ( Curtis and Reigeluth , 1984 ) . In terms of enrichment , most of the analogies found in Turkish high school textbooks are in the S class ( 73 . 9 % ) . Very few analogies identified were in the Ex class ( 4 . 4 % ) . In Curtis and Reigeluth’s ( 1984 ) study , most analogies identified were in the En category ( 81 . 0 % ) , followed by the Ex category ( 13 . 0 % ) . In Newton ( 2003 ) study of primary school textbooks , no analogies were identified as belonging to the Ex class ( Table 5 ) . According to Else et al . ( 2008 ) , simple analogies are useful educational tools for creating general familiarity , because they provide entry - level knowledge about a completely unfamiliar topic . Bean et al . ( 1985 ) and Duit ( 1991 ) state that because of their structure , simple analogies are more helpful to students at lower levels than to those with deeper knowledge of a topic . The large number of simple analogies in Turkish high school science textbooks suggests that these books have been prepared with lower - level students in mind . Many scholars have argued that a target concept can be taught more comprehensively by utilizing En analogies rather than S analogies , which concern only the most basic relationships ( Duit et al . , 2001 ; Glynn et al . , 1989 ; Harrison and Treagust , 2006 ; Iding , 1997 ; Orgill and Bodner , 2006 ; Thiele and Treagust , 1994 ) . In this sense , it is important to include high numbers of En and Ex analogies in textbooks . En and Ex analogies are those in which the limits of an analogy are determined accurately , and multiple mappings between the analog and the target can be established . Establishing these types of analogies 1850 Educ . Res . Rev . may require more effort and additional research . Perhaps for these reasons , secondary education science text - books are less likely to contain En and Ex analogies . Conflict of interests The author has not declared any conflict of interests .
