A role for aLIPC in deriving stimulus - to - regions are relatively specialized for phonology and that representation mappings that are relatively ambiguous and their involvement in semantic processing relates is not entirely inconsistent with results from previous to phonological processes associated with meaning - studies of phonology .

Left BA 21 , by contrast , times been activated during reading of pseudowords showed a more absolute response pattern , activating ( Herbster et al . , 1997 ; Hagoort et al . , 1999 ) and rhyming only during controlled semantic decisions .

An open question involves aLIPC’s precise role in controlled phonology task conditions such as the pres - ent short / long vowel task performed with pseudowords .
