Cooper Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , Washington University School of Medicine , St . Louis , Missouri 63110 Abstract . Bursts of actin polymerization in vivo in - volve the transient appearance of free barbed ends . To determine how rapidly barbed ends might appear and how long they might remain free in vivo , we studied the kinetics of capping protein , the major barbed end cap - per , binding to barbed ends in vitro . First , the off - rate constant for capping protein leaving a barbed end is slow , predicting a half - life for a capped barbed end of ~ 30 min . This half - life implies that cells cannot wait for capping protein to spontaneously dissociate from capped barbed ends in order to create free barbed ends . However , we find that phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) and phosphatidylinositol 4 - mono - phosphate ( PIP ) cause rapid and efficient dissociation of capping protein from capped filaments . PIP2 is a strong candidate for a second messenger regulating ac - tin polymerization ; therefore , the ability of PIP2 to re - move capping protein from barbed ends is a potential mechanism for stimulating actin polymerization in vivo . Second , the on - rate constant for capping protein bind - ing to free barbed ends predicts that actin filaments could grow to the length of filaments observed in vivo during one lifetime . Third , capping protein [ 3 - subunit isoforms did not differ in their actin binding properties , even in tests with different actin isoforms . A major hy - pothesis for why capping protein 13 - subunit isoforms ex - ist is thereby excluded . Fourth , the proposed capping protein regulators , Hsc70 and S100 , had no effect on capping protein binding to actin in vitro . C ONTROL of actin assembly is essential for cell loco - motion and rapid changes in cell shape . One hy - pothesis for regulating the location and dynamics of actin polymerization in vivo is to alter the availability of free actin filament barbed ends near the plasma mem - brane . In vitro , the barbed end of an actin filament is the end favored for actin polymerization and , thus , is a likely site for rapid actin polymerization in cells . Upon stimula - tion of several types of cells , increased numbers of free barbed ends correlate with increased actin polymerization . The polymerization is sensitive to cytochalasin and , there - fore , involves barbed ends ( 7 , 24 , 25 , 46 ) . Most actin filament barbed ends are not freely accessi - ble in cells ( 25 , 34 ) and are likely blocked from elongation by the barbed end binding protein , capping protein ( 18 , 53 ) . Knowing the dynamics of capping protein binding to F - actin and the intracellular concentrations of capping protein and actin would enable us to predict the half - lives of free and capped barbed ends in cells and to predict how capping protein participates in regulating actin assembly . Therefore , we determined the kinetic rate constants for actin binding of capping protein from muscle ( CP - 131 ) and Address all correspondence to Dr . Dorothy A .

( The name " cap - ping protein , " given to the first member of this family of barbed end actin binding proteins [ 34a ] , is used here to re - fer to the vertebrate homologue . To differentiate the ver - tebrate capping protein isoforms , we use the name CP - 131 , for capping protein containing the 131 - subunit [ CP - 131 is also known as CapZ because of its location at Z - disks { 11 } ] , and CP - 132 , for capping protein containing the 132 - subunit . ) We also investigated potential signals proposed to regu - late the actin binding activities of capping protein . Regu - lated uncapping of actin filaments is an attractive mecha - nism for increasing the number of free barbed ends in response to extracellular signals . Capping protein is re - leased from the actin cytoskeleton upon platelet activation ( 47 ) , consistent with uncapping . In addition , the mainte - nance of uncapped filament barbed ends at the rear of Listeria has been proposed as one mechanism for the actin assembly that drives movement of the bacterium ( 44 ) . Polyphosphoinositides have been proposed to mediate actin assembly ( 37 ) ; in particular , uncapping of barbed ends by phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) 1 has 1 .

Therefore , we tested the ability of phosphoinositides to promote dissociation of cap - ping protein from F - actin . Hsc70 ( 21 , 28 ) and S100 pro - teins ( 35 , 36 ) also have been reported to interact with capping protein , but their effects on actin binding using purified components are not known . Therefore , we tested whether or not Hsc70 and S100 proteins affect the actin binding properties of capping protein . Vertebrates have two isoforms of the capping protein 13 subunit . CP - [ 31 is the predominant capping protein of mus - cle and is found at Z - disks of sarcomeres ( 11 ) . CP - 132 is the predominant isoform in nonmuscle tissues . CP - 132 also is expressed in small amounts in muscle cells , where it is dis - tributed at the cell periphery , but not at Z - disks ( 54 ) . The two 13 subunits arise from alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts and only differ in ~ 30 amino acids at their COOH termini . The different COOH - terminal amino acid sequences are presumed to be important because they are highly conserved among vertebrates . Since the COOH ter - minus of the 13 subunit is necessary for binding actin ( 33 ) , we hypothesized that the isoforms differ in their actin bind - ing properties . For example , binding of CP - [ 31 to F - actin may be highly stable in order to stabilize the actin filaments of the sarcomere . On the other hand , binding of CP - 132 to F - actin may be dynamic to regulate the rapid polymeriza - tion of cortical actin filaments important for locomotion and changes in shape . A corollary to this hypothesis is that the actin - binding properties of capping protein [ 3 subunit isoforms may be differentially modulated by cellular fac - tors such as PIP2 , Hsc70 , and S100 proteins . An alternate hypothesis to account for the existence of two 13 subunit isoforms is that CP - [ 31 and CP - 132 interact selectively with different isoforms of actin . The distribu - tions of CP - [ 31 to sarcomeres and CP - 132 to the cortex within single cardiomyocytes ( 54 ) parallel the distributions of sarcomeric ( a - actin ) and nonsarcomeric ( 13 - and 3 , - actins ) actins ( 16 , 31 , 48 ) . Therefore , CP - 131 may preferentially bind a - actin and CP - [ 32 may preferentially bind [ ? , 3 , - actin . To test the hypotheses that ( a ) the actin binding properties of CP - 131 and CP - 132 are different or are differentially reg - ulated , and ( b ) that CP - [ 31 and CP - 132 interact differentially with actin isoforms , we purified capping protein from chicken kidney ( CP - 132 ) , from chicken brain ( CP - [ 32 ) , and from chicken pectoral muscle ( CP - 131 ) and compared their actin binding activities using actin from skeletal muscle ( a - actin ) , from erythrocytes ( 13 - actin ) , and from brain ( 133 , - actin ) .

The purity of CP - [ 32 and a comparison of the subunit compositions of capping protein of skeletal muscle and kidney are documented in silver - stained , 2 - D gels ( Fig . 2 ) . CP - [ 31 from skeletal muscle contains the al - and a2 - subunits in a molar ratio of ~ l : l and the 131 subunit ( including a modi - fied form of the [ 31 subunit called 131 ' ) ( 6 , 54 ) . CP - [ 32 from kidney has two c ~ subunits , cd and a2 in a ratio of ~ 1 : 2 , and the 132 subunit ; CP - [ 32 from brain had an identical subunit composition . Immunoblots of identical gels probed with antibodies specific for c ~ subunits ( mAb 5B12 ) , the 131 subunit ( mAb 1E5 ) , and the 132 subunit ( mAb 3F2 ) confirmed the identification of these protein spots ( data not shown ) . A minor protein component migrating in the 2 - D gel with a mobility in the SDS dimension like that of the a subunits but having a more basic iso - electric point was detected in the capping protein preparations from kid - ney and skeletal muscle ( labeled c ~ 3 ? in Fig . 2 ) ; this protein reacted on im - munoblots probed with mAb 5B12 ( data not shown ) . This minor component may be the chicken homologue of a protein of mouse testicu - lar germ cells that was identified by cDNA cloning and is similar to cap - ping protein a subunits ( 56 ) ; the predicted isoelectric point of the mouse protein ( pl = 6 . 7 ) is consistent with that of the protein we tentatively des - ignate the c ~ 3 subunit on the 2 - D gels .

Silver - stained two - dimensional gels of CP - 131 purified from chicken pectoral muscle ( upper gel ) and CP - [ 32 purified from chicken kidney ( lower gel ) . The positions of the individual capping protein subunits were identified by reaction with t ~ - and [ 3 - specific antibodies and from the predicted mobilities of the subunits ( 15 ) . The major difference in subunit composition be - tween the capping protein isoforms is the 13 subunit : CP - [ 31 con - tains the 131 subunit ( [ 31 and 131 ' ) and CP - 132 contains the 132 sub - unit . Preparations of both capping protein isoforms contained a small amount of a putative , novel a subunit protein we tenta - tively label " c ~ 3 ? " based on its reaction with mAb 5B12 ( data not shown ) . tion for skeletal muscle ~ - actin and erythrocyte 13 - actin were determined by incubation of 1 ~ M c ~ - or [ 3 - actin ( each containing 10 % pyrene - labeled ~ - actin as a tracer for polymerization ) in MKEI buffer ( 0 . 1 M KCL 2 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM EGTA and 20 mM imidazole - HCl , pH 7 . 0 ) with varying concentrations of CP - [ 31 and CP - [ 32 . Samples were incubated for 24 h at room temperature with gentle rocking and pyrene fluorescence was mea - sured ( 13 ) . The Kd for capping protein binding to actin was determined from the amount of capping protein that changes the critical concentra - tion by 50 % as described ( 58 ) using elongation rate constants for ATP - actin ( 50 ) . Actin Polymerization Assays Actin polymerization from spectrin - F - actin seeds was assayed using 1 . 5 IxM actin ( 5 or 10 % pyrene labeled ) , 0 . 054 - - 0 . 25 nM spectrin - F - actin seeds and varying concentrations of CP - [ 3I or CP - 132 in MKEI buffer . Mono - meric actin was diluted to 1 . 5 txM in MKEI buffer and preincubated for 160 s to allow exchange of Mg z + for Ca 2 + on the actin . Spectrin - F - actin seeds and either CP - 131 or CP - [ 32 were added to the cuvette and pyrene fluorescence ( 5 ) was monitored for up to 1 , 040 s . Assays were performed at 25°C . Actin Uncapping Assay The uncapping assay was a modification of the actin polymerization assay using 0 . 23 nM spectrin - F - actin seeds , 2 ~ M actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) and varying concentrations of CP - [ 31 or CP - 132 . The buffer was 0 . l MKEI ( 0 . 1 M KCI , 0 . 2 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , and 20 mM imidazole - HCl , pH 7 . 0 ) , which was determined to be optimal for PIP2 - mediated uncapping . The reaction was initiated by the addition of the spectrin - F - actin seeds and capping protein to monomeric actin in 0 . 1 MKEI . Phospholipids were added to the polymerization reaction at 340 s and the fluorescence was monitored for a total of 1 , 200 s . Assays were performed at 25°C . Assays were performed using Hsc70 and S - 100b in place of phospholipids to test whether these proteins induced uncapping . In some experiments , actin fil - aments capped by CP - [ 31 were used in place of spectrin - F - actin seeds . The capped filaments were prepared by mixing 0 . 11 izM CP - [ 31 and 11 I ~ M c ~ - actin in 0 . 1 MKEI buffer overnight at room temperature . To test mixed micelles of PIP2 and PE , PIP2 and PE were mixed in molar ratios of 1 : 3 to l : 100 , sonicated in a bath sonicator for 15 min and added to uncapping as - says so that the final concentration of phospholipid was 100 ~ tM . Determination of the Rate Constants for Capping F - actin The rate constants for capping actin filaments were determined from data collected in actin polymerization assays using the kinetic parameter opti - mization programs , KINSIM ( 3 ) and FITSIM ( 61 ) . The kinetic mecha - nism used for the simulation was steps 1 and 2 of the mechanism shown below , where A is actin monomer , AN is the number of actin filaments and also equals the number of speetrin - F - actin seeds , C is capping pro - tein , and PIP2 is itself .

The on - rate and off - rate constants for [ 3 - actin were determined using KINSIM and the critical concentration for [ 3 - actin ( determined experimentally to be 0 . 16 ~ M ) ; the on - rate and off - rate constants for nonmuscle actin were 10 . 0 p , M ~ s ~ and 1 . 6 s ~ , respectively . This mechanism assumes that there is no pointed end growth from the spectrin - F - actin seeds . To confirm this assumption , we Schafer et al .

For kinetic simulations of the action of PIPz on capped filaments , steps 1 - 5 of the mechanism shown above were used . The on - rate and off - rate constants assigned for step 1 were 11 . 6 IxM ts - ~ and 1 . 4 s - t , respectively , and for step 2 were 3 . 6 IxM is - 1 and 4 . 0 X 10 - 4 S - 1 , respectively . Rate constants for steps 3 - 5 were varied over a wide range to obtain simulated progress curves using KINSIM , which were compared with the experi - mental data for actin polymerization in the presence of capping protein and PIP2 . Actin Depolymerization Assay F - actin at 5 IxM ( 40 - 50 % pyrene - labeled ) was mixed with varying amounts of CP - [ 31 or CP - 132 , incubated 5 min at room temperature , and diluted 25 - fold into G buffer ( 2 mM Tris - Cl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 2 mM CaCI2 , and 0 . 005 % NAN3 ) at 25°C in a fluorometer cuvette with a stirring bar ( 5 ) . The decrease in pyrene fluorescence accom - panying actin depolymerization was monitored for 300 s after dilution . To test the effects of PIPe , phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate Hsc70 , and S - 100 proteins on capping activity , 50 nM CP - [ 31 or CP - 132 was incu - bated for 5 min with varying concentrations of the test reagent before ad - dition to F - actin . The effects of Hsc70 were measured in the presence of 5 mM ATP or 5 mM ADP and 5 mM MgCI2 . The effects of S - 100 proteins were measured in the presence and absence of CaCI ; at 0 . 2 - 1 mM . Actin Nucleation Assay Monomeric actin at 5 txM ( 10 % pyrene labeled ) was incubated with CP - 131 or CP - 132 for 5 rain in G buffer . Fluorescence of pyrene - actin was mon - itored after the addition of 1 / 10 volume of 10× MKEI to the cuvette . Analysis of the Interaction of CP and Hsc70 For gel filtration analysis , CP - 132 was mixed in a final volume of 0 . 2 ml in buffer S ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 M KCI , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 5 mM ADP , and 5 mM MgCI2 ) with Hsc70 ( molar ratio Hsc70 : CP - 132 of 2 : 1 ) . The mixture was applied to a Superose 12 HR column ( 1 x 30 cm ) equilibrated in buffer S . Fractions were assayed for capping protein and Hsc70 by Western blotting using mAb 5B12 , mAb 3F2 , and anti - Hsc70 . Control runs were of Hsc70 alone and CP - 132 alone . For immunoprecipitation analysis , CP - 131 or CP - 132 was mixed in a molar ratio of 3 : 1 ( Hsc70 : CP ) with Hsc70 in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 15 M NaCI , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 1 mg / ml bovine serum al - bumin . A final concentration of either 5 mM ATP and 5 mM MgCI2 or 5 mM ADP and 5 mM MgC12 was added to each sample . The mixtures were incubated for 1 h on ice ; 10 Ixg of mAb 5B12 , mAb 3F2 , mAb 1E5 , mouse IgG , or monoclonal anti - Hsc70 was added and incubated for 2 h . Immune complexes were isolated using BioMag goat anti - mouse lgG ( PerSeptive Diagnostics , Cambridge , MA ) , washed eight times in 10 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 45 M NaC1 , 1 % Triton X - 100 and twice in 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 15 M NaCI , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . The immune complexes were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on Western blots probed with a mix - ture of mAb 5B12 , mAb 3F2 , mAb l E5 , and anti - Hsc70 . Falling Ball Viscometry Assay Falling ball viscometry assays were performed at room temperature as de - scribed ( 12 ) . Results Kinetic Rate Constants The rate constants for binding of CP - 131 and CP - 132 to muscle a - actin , erythrocyte 13 - actin , and brain 13 " y - actin were determined using kinetic simulations of the time course of actin polymerization in the presence of varying concentrations of CP - 151 and CP - 132 ( Fig . 3 ) The on - rate constants ( k + ) and the off - rate constants ( k _ ) for CP - ~ 31 and CP - 132 ( Table I ) were similar to each other and to those determined for capping activity in supernatant frac - tions from neutrophils ( 18 ) .

The change in pyrene - actin fluorescence accompanying polymerization is plot - ted versus time after addition of the capping protein and spec - trin - F - actin seeds to a solution of 1 . 5 IxM tx - actin in MKEI buffer . The solid lines represent the simulated progress curves predicted from kinetic modeling for two concentrations of each capping protein isoform . ing ct - actin was slightly higher for CP - ~ 2 ( mean value de - rived from three determinations = 5 . 7 ixM - Is - I ) than for CP - 131 ( mean value derived from three determinations = 3 . 5 / xM - ls - l ) . The off - rate constants for dissociation of capping protein from a barbed end were low ( mean value derived from six determinations - - 4 × 10 - 4 S - I ) . These rate constants predict that the half - life of a capped barbed end in cells is long ( ~ 28 rain ) , while the half - life for a free barbed end is short ( ~ 0 . 2 s ) ; the implications of these half - lives for control of actin polymerization by capping pro - tein will be considered below ( see Discussion ) . We also determined the dissociation constant ( Kd ) for binding CP - 131 and CP - 132 to muscle and nonmuscle actins by measuring the ability of each isoform to alter the criti - cal concentration for actin polymerization ( Fig . 4 ) . The Kas for actin binding ( Table I ) were nearly identical for CP - [ 31 and CP - [ ~ 2 , ranging from 0 . 06 _ + 0 . 02 to 0 . 13 _ + 0 . 02 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 172 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Table 1 .

The error in this estimate was determined by estimating the error in the individual data points for each curve and calculation of the upper and rower limits for the Kd . : ! These on - rate and off - rate constants were determined using the simulation program FITSIM ; each value is the best fit obtained using 4 - 5 experimental data sets . The errors are the errors calculated by the algorithm for each independent analysis . The determinations using ot - actin were from three independent experiments ; the rate constants with i3 - actin and 13v - actin were each determined in one experiment . . ~ This off - rate was calculated from the Ku value indicated in column 3 of lhis table and the on - rate constant ( column 4 of this table ) determined using FITSIM . The formula is Kj = k _ i / k + 1 . nM , and there was no difference in the Kas for binding of CP - 131 and CP - 132 to different actin isoforms . Our values for the Kd are consistent with the previously published Kd for CP - 131 binding to c ~ - actin , which was reported to have an upper limit of 0 . 5 - 1 nM ( 6 , 9 ) and with a Kd of 0 . 07 nM measured for binding human capping protein prepared by in vitro translation to ot - actin ( 2 ) . Because the determination of the off - rate constant from kinetic simulations is not as precise as the determination of the on - rate constant , we also calculated the off - rate con - stants from the on - rate constants and the KdS ( Kd = k _ / k + ) . The values for these calculated off - rate constants ( mean value from four determinations = 4 × 10 - 4 s - 1 ) are consis - tent with those obtained using kinetic simulations ( Table I ) . 3 . 4 3 . 2 . . - . . 3 J ¢ } 2 . 8 O3 Lt - " - - " 2 . 4 " 2 . 2 t I I • CP - ~ I • CP - I ] 2 - - - lYactin . . . . o ~ - actin - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 log [ CP ] ( nM ) Figure 4 .

Comparison of the Actin Binding Properties of CP - fll and CP - fl2 The rate constants for CP - 131 and CP - 132 binding to actin were similar , even in assays with different actin isoforms . To verify these results , we performed three additional as - says that test properties different from those tested in the preceding experiments . First , CP - 131 and CP - [ 32 were iden - tical in their concentration dependence for inhibiting de - polymerization of F - actin upon dilution ( Fig . 5 ) . Second , both CP - 131 and CP - I32 promoted nucleation of actin poly - merization ( Fig . 6 ) ; CP - 131 nucleated actin polymerization slightly better than CP - 132 . Third , CP - [ 31 and CP - [ 32 had identical effects on the low - shear viscosity of F - actin ( data not shown ) . The results from these assays confirm that the different structures of the 13 subunit isoforms neither con - fer a difference in the steady - state equilibrium binding to F - actin nor impart selective binding of CP - 131 and CP - 132 to different actin isoforms . The reason for the evolution and conservation of different COOH - terminal 13 subunit peptides in vertebrates remains unknown . The isoforms are targeted to different locations in the cell ( 54 ) . At those locations , the isoforms presumably possess some differen - tiation of function that justifies their targeting . Regulation of Capping Protein Regulation of capping activity is one mechanism to alter the availability of free barbed ends in cells . Three poten - tial regulators of capping protein activity have been de - scribed based on their interactions with capping protein in vitro : anionic phospholipids , especially PIPe ( 30 ) , heat shock cognate protein 70 ( Hsc70 ) ( 20 , 28 ) and $ 100 pro - teins ( 35 ) . Uncapping Actin Filaments by Anionic Phospholipids PIPe rapidly and efficiently promoted the dissociation of capping protein from actin filaments ( Fig . 7 A ) . Thus , PIP2 could be the signaI for uncapping barbed ends during actin remodelling in vivo . A typical uncapping assay using CP - 131 and ct - actin is shown in Fig . 7 A ; similar results were ob - Schafer et al .

In this assay designed specifically to look at uncapping , PIP 2 at 36 IxM was added to a polymerization reaction containing capping protein at a time when most of the actin filaments were capped ( arrow at 340 s for curve 3 in Fig . 7 A ) . The rate of actin polymerization increased dramatically upon addition of the PIP2 ( compare curves 2 and 3 in Fig . 7 A ) , approaching the maximal rate of actin polymerization in the absence of capping protein ( compare curves 1 and 3 in Fig . 7 A ) . Cytochalasin D at 20 nM inhibited the increased rate of polymerization induced by PIP2 ( curve 4 in Fig . 7 A ) , indicating that free barbed ends had been created . PIP2 had no effect on the rate of polymerization of actin alone Figure 7 . PIP2 promotes the dissociation of capping protein from actin filaments .

The immediate increase in fluorescence ob - served upon addition of PIP2 may be due to light scattering by the PIP2 ( 39 ) , PIP2 induced a large increase in the rate of actin poly - merization from capped actin filaments ( compare curves 2 and 3 ) that approached the rate of polymerization of actin alone ( curve 1 ) . Cytochalasin D inhibited the increase in actin polymerization due to PIPz ( curve 4 ) . Similar results were obtained in experiments using CP - 132 with either a - actin or 13 ~ / - actin ( data not shown ) . ( B ) Comparison of the effects of different phospholipids on uncap - ping actin filaments . Assays like those in A were performed with 2 / ~ M a - actin , 4 nM CP - 131 , and varying concentrations of PIPs , PIP2 , P / P , PI , and PA . Uncapping activity is defined as the rate of actin polymerization , calculated from the slope of the pyrene flu - orescence versus time , during the early linear phase after addi - tion of the phospholipid . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 174 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m ( data not shown ) , thus , PIP2 did not alter actin monomer interactions and did not sever filaments . Assays using cap - ping protein - capped F - actin seeds in place of spectrin - F - actin seeds gave similar results ( data not shown ) . Concentrations of PIP2 > ~ 40 ixM did not further in - crease the rate of polymerization . The half maximal effect was at , ' - ~ 20 p ~ M PIP e ( Fig . 7 B ) . PIP 2 was equally effective in uncapping when present as mixed lipid vesicles with phosphatidylethanolamine ( molar ratios of PIPz / PE of 1 : 2 and 1 : 9 , data not shown ) . PIP also uncapped actin fila - ments but was less efficient than PIP 2 ( Fig . 7B ) . PI , PA , and , surprisingly , PIP3 had little or no uncapping activity ( Fig . 7 B ) . PIP3 has been proposed to control transient ac - tin polymerization ( 43 ) since changes in the levels of PIP3 in platelets ( 41 ) and neutrophils ( 19 ) parallel the time course of actin polymerization and subsequent depolymer - ization in stimulated cells . We report the first description of the effect of PIP3 on the activity of an actin binding pro - tein and find that PIP3 did not uncap filaments at all and was less potent than PIP2 in inhibiting capping activity ( see below ) . Thus , the different structural features of polyphos - phoinositides , not merely their anionic character , deter - mine how they interact with capping protein . The uncapping activity of PIP 2 depended critically on the concentration of Mg2 + ; 0 . 2 mM MgC12 supported high activity . At 2 mM MgC12 , PIP2 induced a far smaller in - crease in the rate of actin polymerization in the uncapping assay ( data not shown ) . This slight effect was similar to that seen previously by Heiss et al . , using 2 mM MgCl2 and a different experimental design ( 30 ) . The dependence of the PIPe - induced actin polymerization on [ Mg e + ] may be due to aggregation of PIP2 by divalent cations ( 38 ) . The free [ Mg e÷ ] in cells is ~ 0 . 5 mM but is heterogeneously dis - tributed . In peripheral regions near the plasma membrane where PIP2 - mediated signaling should occur , the free [ Mg e + ] is significantly lower ( 17 , 52 ) . Thus , the low [ Mg 2÷ ] necessary for optimal PIP2 - mediated uncapping is likely to exist in vivo . Inhibition of Capping Activity by Phosphoinositides The capping activity of CP - 132 was inhibited in a concen - tration - dependent manner by PIP2 ( Fig . 8 B ) , as previ - ously observed for CP - 131 ( Fig . 8 A ) ( 30 ) . PIP 3 also inhib - ited capping protein but concentrations ~ 10 - fold higher than those required for inhibition by PIP2 , were required for inhibition of capping activity by PIP3 ( Fig . 8 C ) . Effects of Hsc 70 on Capping Protein Activity Regulation of Dictyostelium capping protein by Hsc70 was suggested by the existence of a stable complex between Hsc70 and capping protein in whole cell extracts ( 21 , 28 ) and by an Hsc70 - induced increase in capping activity of mixtures of bacterially expressed capping protein c ~ and [ 3 subunits ( 28 ) . The availability of purified capping protein and Hsc70 allowed us to test whether or not Hsc70 directly alters capping protein ' s actin binding activity . Hsc70 from bovine brain in the presence of either 5 mM ATP or 5 mM ADP had no effect on the capping activity of CP - [ 31 or CP - 132 as measured in actin depolymerization assays ( Fig . 9 ) . Hsc70 also did not promote uncapping ( data not shown ) .

Results from both sets of experiments indicated that Hsc70 did not associate with capping protein . Taken together , our results indicate that Hsc70 does not bind to or influence the activity of capping protein , which is in contrast with conclusions of previous studies ( 28 ) .

Experiments performed in the presence of 5 mM Mg - ATP gave identical results ( data not shown ) . protein also conclude that the isoform of Hsc70 that copu - rifles with capping protein does not regulate capping pro - tein ( 21 ) . In the previous studies , which used whole cell ex - tracts , Hsc70 may have acted as a chaperone to promote the folding of capping protein . Alternative explanations for the difference between our results and the earlier stud - ies include that bovine Hsc70 may not interact with chicken capping protein and that a specific isoform of Hsc70 , not the one tested here , interacts with capping pro - tein . Effects of S I O0 Proteins on Capping Protein Activity $ 100 proteins have been proposed to regulate actin fila - ment assembly in vivo via a calcium - dependent interaction with capping protein ( 35 , 36 ) . We tested whether or not $ 100 proteins alter the interaction of CP - [ 31 with c ~ - actin in the presence and absence of CaCl2 . Three types of experi - ments were performed : falling ball viscometry assays , actin depolymerization assays , and assays for uncapping of capped actin filaments . We find that S100 protein binding to capping protein does not alter capping protein ' s interac - tion with actin ( data not shown ) ; therefore , capping pro - tein can simultaneously bind actin and $ 100 protein . Cap - ping protein may serve to position $ 100 protein at Z - disks , the location of both capping protein ( 11 ) and S100a0 ( 23 ) in muscle . The importance of locating $ 100 protein in the sarcomere is underscored by the recent finding that S100A12 activated in a CaZ + - dependent manner the kinase domain of twitchin , which may be important for organiz - ing muscle structure and regulating contraction ( 29 ) . Discussion Implications of Kinetics of Capping Protein Knowing the rate constants for the interaction of capping protein with actin filaments in vitro is necessary to under - stand how capping protein may regulate the dynamics of actin assembly in vivo . Kinetic rate constants allow one to predict the half - lives for free and capped actin filament barbed ends and to predict the amount of actin polymer - ized during the time a barbed end is free . The rate of un - capping can also be compared with the rate of creation of free barbed ends in cells stimulated by agents that induce rapid changes in the actin cytoskeleton . Implications of the On - rate Constant The on - rate constant of 3 . 0 ~ M - Is - 1 , together with a cellu - lar concentration of capping protein from 0 . 2 to 2 I ~ M ( 14 , 18 , 34 , 47 ) , predicts a half - life for a free barbed end in vivo of 0 . 1 - 1 s . Actin polymerization from free barbed ends de - pends on the concentration of available actin subunits , which includes the pools of profilin - actin and free G - actin monomer ( 49 , 51 ) . At an upper limit for the actin subunit pool in vivo of ~ 100 p ~ M ( 8 ) , a free barbed end could grow from 0 . 3 to 3 ~ zm during 0 . 1 to 1 s . Thus , actin filaments with free barbed ends could elongate to lengths observed for actin filaments in vivo ( 0 . 5 - 0 . 6 ~ m in macrophages [ 26 ] ; 0 . 18 - 2 . 1 ~ m in neutrophils [ 7 ] ; ~ 0 . 3 ~ m in Listeria tails [ 57 ] ) before being capped . Implications of the Off - rate Constant The off - rate constant of 4 x 10 - 4 s - 1 for dissociation of capping protein from F - actin predicts a half - life for a capped barbed end of ~ 28 min . This half - life is much longer than the time observed for the increase in number of barbed ends and in F - actin in cells responding to stim - uli . For example , within 90 s after neutrophils encountered chemoattractant , the amount of F - actin and the total num - ber of actin filaments more than doubled ( 7 ) . Also , within 30 s after stimulation of platelets with thrombin , the num - ber of free barbed ends increased from ~ 50 to ~ 500 per platelet ( 25 , 27 ) . This large discrepancy between the rapid rate for actin remodelling in vivo and the slow rate for dis - sociation of capping protein from barbed ends led us to search for factors that accelerate uncapping of barbed ends . Regulators that cause uncapping also may account for the discrepancy between the apparent Ka of ~ 100 nM for Dictyostelium capping protein in whole cell extracts The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 176 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m ( 34 ) and the K d of ~ 1 nM for purified Dictyostelium cap - ping protein ( 21 ) . Uncapping Actin Filaments by Phosphoinositides Our tests of several possible regulators of capping protein indicate that the polyphosphoinositides , PIP2 and , to a lesser extent , PIP , induce the dissociation of capping pro - tein from barbed ends . It is likely that PIP2 binds directly to capping protein and increases its rate constant for disso - ciation from F - actin . Kinetic simulations based on such a model predict the observed changes in actin polymeriza - tion well ( see description of simulations in Materials and Methods ) . In contrast , simulations of a model in which PIP2 sequesters free capping protein after it dissociates from barbed ends at the usual slow rate do not fit the ex - perimental data . Is the PIP2 - induced actin polymerization from capped filaments observed in vitro sufficient to account for in - creased actin polymerization in stimulated cells ? In plate - lets , ~ 500 new free barbed ends were created from ~ 2 , 000 capped filaments by 30 - 60 s after stimulation with throm - bin ( 27 ) . At conditions for maximal uncapping in vitro , PIP2 decreased the half - life for a capped barbed end from ~ 28 min to ~ 46 s . We calculate from a tile of 46 s that 500 free barbed ends could be created in ~ 19 s . Thus , the rate of PIP2 - induced uncapping observed in vitro is sufficient to account for the number of free barbed ends that appear in stimulated platelets . Signal transduction pathways in which phosphoinosi - tides function require that the levels of phosphoinositides change in response to the stimulus . However , the total mass of PIP2 decreases , rather than increases following stimulation of platelets ( 59 ) . On the other hand , turnover of PIP2 is increased in platelets upon stimulation ( 1 ) , rais - ing the possibility that local changes in the PIP 2 concentra - tion occur during signaling . The identification in some cells of specialized membrane domains enriched in PIP2 , glycosphingolipids , and a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase ( 4 , 32 ) supports the idea that the PIP2 concentration may vary spatially . Model for Actin Assembly In Vivo We propose a mechanism for remodeling the actin cyto - skeleton in stimulated cells that accounts for the increases in the number of actin filaments , number of free barbed ends , and amount of F - actin . Our model is based on three processes : uncapping of barbed ends by the action of PIP2 , polymerization at the free barbed ends , and severing the long actin filaments ( Fig . 10 ) . First , PIP2 in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 10 , green ) uncaps actin filaments and gen - erates free barbed ends near the membrane . Polymeriza - tion at free barbed ends lengthens the filaments and ex - tends lamellae and filopodia . PIP2 also inhibits capping of free barbed ends , thereby prolonging filament elongation . Next , the elongated filaments break , creating new fila - ments with free pointed and barbed ends . Finally , when the local PIP2 level decreases , capping protein caps the free barbed ends to stop polymerization . We demonstrate here that PIP2 does uncap actin fila - ment barbed ends . PIP 2 is part of the signaling pathway that induces actin polymerization in permeabilized plate - Figure 10 . Model for actin assembly in stimulated cells . The PIP2 concentration increases in a region of the plasma membrane in response to a local extracellular stimulus ( green ) . PIP2 causes capping protein ( red circles ) to dissociate from the barbed ends of actin filaments . Actin filaments grow at their free barbed ends and push the plasma membrane outward . Elongated filaments then break , because of either mechanical forces or the action of a severing protein . Finally , new free barbed ends situated far from the membrane where capping protein is active become capped . The net effects are protrusion of the plasma membrane and the creation of new filaments the same length as the existing fila - ments , of new pointed ends , and of new barbed ends . lets ( 27 ) . Furthermore , capping protein is released from platelet cytoskeletons upon stimulation by thrombin ( 47 ) . These data are consistent with the first steps of our model where signals mediated by PIPe induce actin remodeling by uncapping barbed ends . One aspect of actin remodeling in vivo that cannot be explained solely by uncapping is an increase in the number of actin filaments . During platelet activation , the total number of filaments increases from 2 , 000 to 2 , 500 per cell ( 27 ) . More dramatic are the findings in stimulated neutro - phils , where the number of actin filaments increases from 1 . 7 x 105 to 4 × 105 per cell without a change in actin fila - ment length ( 7 ) . Clearly , additional processes , such as sev - ering or de novo nucleation , two processes that create new filaments , are required to explain these data . We favor a mechanism where long actin filaments are fragmented to create new filaments . One possible mecha - nism for breaking filaments is via mechanical forces ex - erted on them by myosins or other factors . Alternatively , actin filament severing proteins of the ADF / cofilin or Schafer et al . Dynamics of Capping Protein 177 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m gelsolin families may serve this role . ADF / cofilins are ubiquitous , present at high concentrations in vivo , and can be regulated by phosphorylation and polyphosphoinosi - tides ( for review see [ 45 ] ) . The contribution to severing by gelsolin may be minor since platelets lacking gelsolin as - semble actin normally in response to thrombin ( 60 ) . The gelsolin analogue adseverin / scinderin is another candidate ( for review see [ 53 ] ) . Nucleation of actin filaments de novo from actin mono - mers is an alternative mechanism to create new filaments . Capping protein nucleates actin polymerization in vitro at a rapid rate ( 6 ) . However , filaments nucleated by capping protein are capped at their barbed ends , thus , free barbed ends would not increase unless the new filaments were ei - ther uncapped or severed . In addition , PIPe inhibits the nucleation activity of capping protein ( 30 ) ; thus , increased PIPe would inhibit , rather than promote , actin polymeriza - tion nucleated by capping protein . We thank Dr . Christopher Hug ( of Washington University ) for pyrene - labeled a - actin , Dr . Ching - Shih Chen of the Dept . of Pharmacy at the University of Kentucky for PIP3 , and Drs . Marilyn Hart and Rick Heil - Chapdelaine ( of Washington University ) for help in obtaining erythrocytes . This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health ( GM38542 ) to J .

Barkalow et al . recently reported that either PIP2 or a thrombin activiating peptide , TRAF , induces the release of capping pro - tein from the cytoskeleton of permeabilized platelets ( Fig . 8 in Barkalow , K . , W . Witke , D . J . Kwiatkowski , and J . H . Hartwig . 1996 . J . Cell Biol . 134 : 389 - 399 ) . These data support the initial step of our model ( Fig . 10 ) where polyphosphoinositides release capping protein from actin filaments to cre - ate free barbed ends . References 1 . Agranoff , B .
