HOESSLI 1 Department of Pathology , Centre Me (cid:33) dical Universitaire , 1 rue Michel Servet , 1211 Geneva 4 , Switzerland Sphingolipid microdomains are thought to result from the organization of plasma membrane sphingolipids and cholesterol into a liquid ordered phase , wherein the glycosylphosphatidyl - inositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins are enriched . These domains , resistant to extraction by cold Triton X - 100 , can be isolated as buoyant membrane complexes ( detergent - resistant membranes ) in isopycnic density gradients . Here the eﬀects of methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( MBCD ) , a speciﬁc cholesterol - binding agent that neither binds nor inserts into the plasma membrane , were investigated on the sphingolipid microdomains of lymphocytes . MBCD released substantial quantities of GPI - anchored Thy - 1 and glycosphingolipid GM1 , and also other surface proteins including CD45 , and intracellular Lck and Fyn kinases . From endothelial cells , MBCD released GPI - anchored CD59 , and CD44 , but only a negligible amount of caveolin . Most MBCD - INTRODUCTION The current view of the three - dimensional organization of the mammalian cell plasma membrane envisages selective inter - actions among the membrane lipids and proteins resulting in physical and functional compartmentation into dynamic micro - domains [ 1 , 2 ] . The presence of sphingolipid - rich microdomains in the plasma membrane of both polarized and non - polarized cells has been inferred by biochemical and biophysical methods . Sphingolipid microdomains isolated after non - ionic detergent extraction of membranes are enriched in glycosylphosphatidyl - inositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins in the exoplasmic leaﬂet and harbour doubly acylated Src - family protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) in the cytoplasmic leaﬂet ( reviewed in [ 3 , 4 ] ) . The GPI - linked surface glycoproteins and acylated Src kinases of sphingolipid - rich microdomains remain associated with tri - lamellar vesicles after extraction with cold non - ionic detergent ; these detergent - resistant membranes ( DRMs ) can be separated from solubilized membrane components by size [ 5 , 6 ] or density [ 7 ] . The caveolar membrane specialization is also detergent - resistant [ 8 ] , but accumulated evidence now supports the notion that caveolae and sphingolipid microdomains represent distinct plasma membrane entities [ 9 , 10 ] . The physical properties of sphingolipid microdomains seem to arise from the interaction of sphingolipid hydrocarbon chains with cholesterol , which can form a liquid ordered phase in the liquid - crystalline phospholipid milieu of the plasma membrane outer leaﬂet [ 3 , 11 , 12 ] . Cholesterol associates with sphingolipids in the Golgi complex and stabilizes the microdomains to which GPI - anchored proteins become associated by way of lipid – lipid interactions [ 4 , 7 ] . A number of studies have examined the Abbreviations used : DRM , detergent - resistant membrane ; GPI , glycosylphosphatidylinositol ; GSL , glycosphingolipid ; HRP , horseradish peroxidase ; MBCD , methyl - b - cyclodextrin ; PTK , protein tyrosine kinase ; SLO , streptolysin O . 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed ( e - mail Daniel . Hoessli ! medecine . unige . ch ) . released Thy - 1 and CD59 were not sedimentable and thus diﬀered from Thy - 1 released by membrane - active cholesterol - binding agents such as saponin and streptolysin O , or Triton X - 100 . Unlike that released by Triton X - 100 , only part of the Thy - 1 molecules released by MBCD was buoyant in density gradients and co - isolated with GM1 . Finally , treatment of Triton X - 100 - isolated detergent - resistant membranes with MBCD extracted most of the cholesterol without aﬀecting the buoyant properties of Thy - 1 or GM1 . We suggest that ( 1 ) MBCD preferentially extracts cholesterol from outside , rather than within the sphingo - lipid microdomains and ( 2 ) this partly solubilizes GPI - anchored and transmembrane proteins from the glycerophospholipid - rich membrane and releases sphingolipid microdomains in both vesicular and non - vesicular form . inﬂuence of cholesterol on the physical and functional properties of GPI - anchored proteins in sphingolipid microdomains and caveolae by using diﬀerent methods to lower cellular cholesterol levels such as ( 1 ) cholesterol deprivation by culturing cells in media devoid of exogeneous cholesterol sources [ 13 – 15 ] , ( 2 ) inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by compactin [ 16 ] , lova - statin or sqalestatin [ 17 , 18 ] and ( 3 ) depletion of cholesterol by oxidation to cholestenone [ 19 ] or by cholesterol - binding agents such as ﬁlipin , nystatin , digitonin , saponin or streptolysin O ( SLO ) [ 16 , 20 – 24 ] . These studies have shown that lowering the cellular cholesterol levels markedly aﬀected the properties of GPI - anchored proteins and led to their dispersion on the cell surface [ 16 ] , a decrease in their cell - surface expression [ 20 ] , their release as membrane vesicles [ 24 ] , an increase in solubility in non - ionic detergents [ 15 , 20 , 22 , 23 ] and an impairment of their sig - nalling properties [ 18 ] . On caveolae , cholesterol deprivation or depletion decreased the number of caveolae and decreased caveolae - mediated intracellular and transcellular transport of macromolecules [ 16 , 21 , 25 ] . The diﬀerent ways in which cellular cholesterol levels were lowered had very diﬀerent consequences on GPI - anchored pro - teins and caveolae . For example , treatment with cholesterol - binding agents such as ﬁlipin and saponins resulted in the dispersion of GPI - anchored proteins at the cell surface and facilitated their release from detergent - resistant sphingolipid microdomains [ 20 ] , whereas the inhibition of cholesterol bio - synthesis by lovastatin did not [ 18 ] . Interestingly , certain choles - terol - binding agents such as SLO released membrane vesicles enriched in GPI - anchored proteins and probably released whole sphingolipid microdomains as well [ 24 ] . Likewise , cholesterol depletion by ﬁlipin or nystatin decreased the number of caveolae 434 S . Ilangumaran and D . C . Hoessli [ 16 , 21 ] , whereas cholesterol oxidation to cholestenone did not aﬀect the number or morphology of caveolae but dispersed caveolin from plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles [ 19 ] . In contrast , cellular cholesterol depletion by biosynthetic inhibition did not aﬀect the membrane - associated caveolin [ 26 ] . Whereas cholesterol deprivation and inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis both decreased the steady - state level of membrane cholesterol to approx . 70 % [ 15 , 18 ] , the polyene antibiotics ﬁlipin and nystatin [ 27 , 28 ] , the sapogenin glycosides saponin and digitonin [ 29 , 30 ] andthiol - activated cytolysinSLO [ 31 ] complexed with cholesterol in situ to form multimeric globular deposits in the membrane . In the present study we examined the eﬀects of the cholesterol - binding agent methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( MBCD ) on the detergent insolubility and buoyancy of GPI - anchored proteins and the GM1 glycosphingolipid ( GSL ) in murine lymphocytes . Unlike other cholesterol - binding agents that incorporate into mem - branes , cyclodextrins are strictly surface - acting and selectively extract membrane cholesterol by including it in a central , non - polar cavity of cyclic oligomers of glucopyranoside in a - 1 , 4 glycosidic linkage [ 32 ] . a , b and c cyclodextrins are crystalline , water - soluble compounds that diﬀer in having six , seven and eight glucose residues respectively . Additional substitutions on the external hydroxy groups of glucose and the degree of substitution improve the solubility of the cholesterol - loaded cyclodextrin molecules . Although cyclodextrins have been in use for many years as carriers of lipophilic drugs in pharmacological research , their potential use in membrane studies has been appreciated only recently . b - Cyclodextrins have been shown to extract membrane cholesterol selectively from a variety of cell types [ 33 – 35 ] and represent unique tools for membrane studies in that they neither bind nor insert into the plasma membrane [ 33 ] . Recently , with the use of MBCD as a cholesterol - depleting agent , the association of inﬂuenza virus haemagglutinin was shown to be critically dependent on cholesterol [ 36 ] and necessary for apical sorting [ 37 ] . In our experiments with non - polarized , murine T lymphocytes , we observed that cholesterol extraction by MBCD led to the release of endogenous GPI - anchored pro - teins , transmembrane glycoproteins and membrane - associated PTKs with discernible changes in cellular morphology , but without lysis . The physical properties of Thy - 1 and GM1 released by MBCD were markedly diﬀerent from those released by non - ionic detergents or other cholesterol - binding agents . In addition , a substantial amount of cholesterol was also extracted from Triton X - 100 - isolated DRMs without aﬀecting the buoyancy of the DRM - associated Thy - 1 and GM1 , suggesting that the cholesterol extracted by cyclodextrin is not required for the organization of GPI - anchored proteins and sphingolipids in the buoyant membranes . EXPERIMENTAL Materials MBCD was purchased from Aldrich Chemie ( Steinheim , Ger - many ) . Triton X - 100 , bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit and horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) enhanced chemiluminescence re - agent were from Pierce ( Rockford , IL , U . S . A . ) . Rat monoclonal antibody against murine Thy - 1 . 2 ( 30 - H12 ; ATCC TIB107 ) and CD45 ( M1 (cid:125) 9 . 3 . 4HL . 2 ; ATCC TIB122 ) were from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD , U . S . A . ) . Rabbit poly - clonal antibodies against Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases and HRP - conjugated goat anti - ( rat IgG ) and goat anti - ( rabbit IgG ) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA , U . S . A . ) . SLO was from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA , U . S . A . ) . The murine T - lymphoma cell line P1798 was obtained from Litton Bionetics ( Bethesda , MD , U . S . A . ) and maintained in syngeneic Balb (cid:125) c mice as ascites . Cells collected from the ascitic ﬂuid were washed in PBS twice and once in TKM buﬀer [ 50 mM Tris (cid:125) HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) (cid:125) 25 mM KCl (cid:125) 5 mM MgCl (cid:35) (cid:125) 1 mM EDTA ] . Human umbilical vein - derived endothelial cell line ECV304 was obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium containing 10 % ( v (cid:125) v ) fetal calf serum . Cells , cyclodextrin treatment , detergent lysis , plasma membrane preparation and sucrose gradient centrifugation P1798 cells ( 2 (cid:172) 10 (cid:40) ) were treated with the indicated concen - trations of MBCD in 1 ml of TKM buﬀer at 37 (cid:176) C for 30 min with intermittent shaking , and the cell - free supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min . Triton X - 100 lysates were prepared by lysing 10 (cid:41) cells for 15 min on ice in 1 ml of TKM containing 1 % ( v (cid:125) v ) Triton X - 100 ( TKM (cid:125) Triton X - 100 ) and the protease inhibitors Pefabloc 2 SC ( 2 mM ) , leupeptin ( 1 l M ) and aprotinin ( 2 l g (cid:125) ml ) , all from Boehringer Mannheim ( Mannheim , Germany ) . The post - nuclear supernatants , obtained after centrifugation of the lysate in a Microfuge for 5 min at 4 (cid:176) C , were assayed for protein content by microtitre bicinchoninic acid assay and stored at (cid:174) 20 (cid:176) C . SDS lysates were prepared by boiling 10 (cid:41) cells in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris (cid:125) HCl , pH 7 . 4 , containing 1 % ( w (cid:125) v ) SDS and then sonicated . To prepare total plasma membrane , 10 (cid:42) cells suspended in 5 ml of hypotonic lysis buﬀer [ 10 mM Tris (cid:125) HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) (cid:125) 10 mM KCl (cid:125) 5 mM MgCl (cid:35) (cid:125) 1 mM EGTA ] containing protease inhibitors were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 2000 g to sediment the nuclei . The homogenate was layered over a 40 % ( w (cid:125) v ) sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 100000 g for 1 h . The light - scattering band above the sucrose cushion was collected , washed and resuspended in TKM buﬀer . Equilibrium gradient centrifugation of detergent lysates or MBCD - released material was performed as described previously [ 38 ] . In brief , 1 ml of the Triton X - 100 lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 80 % ( w (cid:125) v ) sucrose , loaded into SW41 tubes and overlaid with 6 ml of 36 % ( w (cid:125) v ) sucrose and ﬁnally topped with 3 . 5 ml of 5 % ( w (cid:125) v ) sucrose in TKM not containing Triton X - 100 . After centrifugation at 250000 g for 16 – 18 h , 1 ml fractions were collected from the top and stored at (cid:174) 20 (cid:176) C . The top fractions ( fractions 3 to 5 ) corresponding to the 5 – 36 % sucrose interface , which contained membrane complexes enriched in GSLs and GPI - anchored proteins [ 38 ] , were pooled and are referred to as DRMs . MBCD - released material was subjected to sedimentation gradient centrifugation in the same manner . Detection of membrane - associated proteins and GM1 ganglioside Detection of membrane proteins in the MBCD - released material and detergent lysates was performed by Western blotting . After SDS (cid:125) PAGE under non - reducing ( for cell surface antigens Thy - 1 , CD45 and CD59 ) or reducing ( for intracellular proteins Lck , Fyn and caveolin ) conditions , the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane . The blots were blocked with 5 % ( w (cid:125) v ) non - fat milk powder in TBST [ 10 mM Tris (cid:125) HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) (cid:125) 100 mM NaCl (cid:125) 0 . 1 % ( v (cid:125) v ) Tween 20 ] , probed with the primary antibody in TBST (cid:125) 0 . 5 % milk powder followed by appropriate HRP - conjugated second antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent . GM1 in gradient fractions or MBCD - released material was detected by binding of cholera toxin : dot - blotted nitrocellulose ﬁlter strips were blocked with 5 % ( w (cid:125) v ) milk powder , incubated with biotinylated cholera toxin ( Sigma Chimie , Buchs , Switzerland ) in TBST (cid:125) 0 . 5 % milk powder , washed and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence . 435 Eﬀects of cyclodextrin on sphingolipid microdomains Cholesterol detection Total plasma membrane and DRMs were pelleted and extracted in chloroform (cid:125) methanol ( 2 : 1 , v (cid:125) v ) . The organic extract was separated on TLC plates ( Silicagel 60 ; Merck ) with chloroform (cid:125) acetone ( 96 : 4 , v (cid:125) v ) and dried in air . Cholesterol was revealed by spraying with FeCl (cid:36) and heating at 100 (cid:176) C for 3 – 5 min [ 39 ] . RESULTS Removal of membrane cholesterol by MBCD releases GPI - linked surface molecules , GSLs , transmembrane receptors and membrane - associated PTKs To investigate the eﬀects of cholesterol removal on membrane proteins , cells were ﬁrst treated with MBCD , and then sequen - tially with Triton X - 100 and SDS . Analysis of the cell - free supernatant after treatment with MBCD showed that a sub - stantial amount of Thy - 1 was released ( Figure 1A , lane 3 ) compared with spontaneous release in buﬀer at 37 (cid:176) C ( lane 2 ) and approx . 5 - fold more than that released by 1 % ( v (cid:125) v ) Triton X - 100 at 4 (cid:176) C ( lane 4 ) . Release of Thy - 1 by MBCD was already Figure 1 MBCD releases Thy - 1 and other membrane - associated proteins with a concomitant decrease in cell volume ( A ) P1798 murine T lymphoma cells ( 10 8 ) were incubated for 30 min in TKM buﬀer on ice ( lanes 1 , 4 and 7 ) or at 37 (cid:176) C ( lanes 2 , 5 and 8 ) , or in TKM buﬀer containing 20 mM MBCD at 37 (cid:176) C ( lanes 3 , 6 and 9 ) in a 5 ml volume . The cell - free supernatants in a typical experiment contained 0 . 27 , 0 . 4 and 2 . 5 mg / ml proteins , amounting to the release of 10 . 5 mg of protein by MBCD from 10 8 cells . The cell pellets were washed in cold TKM buﬀer and lysed in 1 ml of TKM / 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ( TX - 100 ) for 15 min on ice . After centrifugation the Triton X - 100 lysates were saved and the remaining cell pellets were lysed in 1 ml of SDS lysis buﬀer [ 10 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) / 1 % ( w / v ) SDS ] , boiled and then sonicated . Cell - free supernatants , Triton X - 100 lysates and SDS lysates ( 20 ml of each ) ( note that the volume ratio was 5 : 1 : 1 ) were Western blotted for Thy - 1 , CD45 , Lck and Fyn . ( B ) Cells ( 2 (cid:172) 10 7 ) were incubated in 1 ml of TKM buﬀer containing 20 mM MBCD at 37 (cid:176) C for the indicated durations , and Thy - 1 detected by Western blotting in 20 ml of the cell - free supernatants was quantiﬁed densitometrically . ( C ) P1798 cells ( 2 (cid:172) 10 7 ) were incubated in 1 ml of TKM either alone or in the presence of 2 . 5 or 20 mM MBCD for 30 min at 37 (cid:176) C . The cells were washed and analysed by ﬂow cytometry for forward and right - angle light scattering . measurable at 1 min and reached a maximum after 20 min ( Figure 1B ) . The smaller amount of Thy - 1 measured in the cell - free supernatant after 40 min of incubation with MBCD could be due to reincorporation [ 40 ] in a form no longer releasable by MBCD . Extraction of the cell pellet with Triton X - 100 after treatment with MBCD released additional Thy - 1 ( Figure 1A , lane 6 ) in amounts not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that released from untreated cells by Triton X - 100 directly ( lanes 4 and 5 ) . Subsequent extraction of the remaining nuclear pellets with SDS showed that the cells treated with Triton X - 100 alone still retained the bulk of Thy - 1 ( Figure 1A , lanes 7 and 8 ) , whereas cells treated with MBCD and Triton X - 100 ( lane 9 ) contained no more Thy - 1 , indicating that cholesterol depletion by MBCD followed by extraction with Triton X - 100 led to a quantitative release of cell - surface Thy - 1 . MBCD at 20 mM released 6 - fold more protein than buﬀer alone ( see the legend to Figure 1 ) . Flow cytometric analysis showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the volume of cells treated with 2 . 5 and 20 mM MBCD , as seen by a decrease in the right - angle light scattering ( Figure 1C ) . Approximately half of the transmembrane receptor CD45 was also released by MBCD treatment ( Figure 1A , lane 3 ) and the remainder was 436 S . Ilangumaran and D . C . Hoessli Figure 2 Buoyant properties of the MBCD - released and Triton X - 100 - extracted plasma membrane - associated molecules P1798 cells were treated with 20 mM MBCD for 30 min at 37 (cid:176) C in TKM buﬀer at 2 (cid:172) 10 7 cells / ml ( A ) or extracted by TKM / 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ( TX - 100 ) for 15 min on ice at 10 8 cells / ml ( B ) . Cell - free supernatant ( 1 ml ) was adjusted to 40 % ( w / v ) sucrose , overlaid with 36 % and 5 % ( w / v ) sucrose ( not containing Triton X - 100 ) in SW41 tubes and subjected to equilibrium gradient centrifugation as described in the Experimental section . Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top ; 20 ml of the indicated fractions were analysed for the distribution of Thy - 1 and Lck by Western blotting . GM1 in 5 ml of the fractions was detected by dot - blotting with HRP - conjugated cholera toxin . Fractions 3 – 5 correspond to the low - density membrane complexes at the 5 – 36 % ( w / v ) sucrose interface ; fractions 9 – 11 correspond to the high - density membrane complexes and solubilized membrane and cytosolic proteins at the sample loading zone . released quantitatively by further extraction of MBCD - treated cells with Triton X - 100 ( lane 6 ) . Cell - surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation with speciﬁc antibodies showed that MBCD released a number of cell - surface molecules including CD26 and MHC class I ( results not shown ) . Substantial amounts of the intracellular , membrane - associated PTKs Lck and Fyn were also released by MBCD ( Figure 1A , lane 3 ) . Subsequent extractions with Triton X - 100 and SDS showed that MBCD - treated cells yielded signiﬁcantly less PTKs in the ﬁnal SDS extract than in the control cells ( Figure 1A , lanes 4 – 9 ) . These results showed that MBCD released the membrane - associated proteins in a manner distinct from that of the non - ionic detergent Triton X - 100 . To deﬁne the form in which the GPI - linked glycoprotein Thy - 1 was released by MBCD , the cell - free 2000 g supernatant was subjected to equilibrium density gradient centrifugation and compared with that of Triton X - 100 - extracted material ( Figure 2 ) . The distribution of GM1 , which co - isolates with GPI - anchored proteins in density gradients [ 38 ] , was also examined . More than 60 % of the Thy - 1 and all of the GM1 in the MBCD - released material were recovered in the low - density fractions , which contained a small part of the released Lck as well ( Figure 2A ) . In comparison , all of the Thy - 1 and GM1 , and a signiﬁcant quantity of the Lck , extracted by Triton X - 100 were present in the low - density fractions as buoyant membrane complexes . Figure 3 Saponin , SLO and heat shock release sedimentable plasma membrane vesicles rich in Thy - 1 P1798 cells in 10 mM Hepes - buﬀered saline , pH 7 . 4 ( 5 (cid:172) 10 6 cells / ml ) were incubated either alone or in the presence of 1 mM CaCl 2 at 37 (cid:176) C for 45 min . After this , aliquots of cells were treated with SLO ( 20 i . u . / ml ) or saponin ( Sap . , 0 . 15 mg / ml ) for 15 min on ice , and SLO - treated cells were washed . Another aliquot was given a heat shock ( HS ) at 42 (cid:176) C for 15 min . All were shifted to 37 (cid:176) C and incubated for 45 min . The 2000 g cell - free supernatants were subjected sequentially to centrifugation at 10000 g ( P10 ) and 100000 g ( P100 ) for 30 min and 1 h to sediment microvesicles and nanovesicles respectively . The amount of released Thy - 1 in the sedimented vesicles was determined by Western blotting . The 100000 g supernatant did not contain a signiﬁcant amount of Thy - 1 ( results not shown ) . Approx . 40 % of the Thy - 1 and 90 % of the Lck released by MBCD were non - buoyant and remained in the sample loading zone of the gradient , suggesting their minimal association with lipids and (cid:125) or association with protein - rich complexes . Treatment with MBCD releases heterogeneous membrane complexes from caveolin - free lymphocytes and caveolin - containing endothelial cells Treatment of erythrocyte membranes with calcium ionophores and nucleated cells with cholesterol - binding drugs have been shown to induce the release of membrane vesicles enriched in GPI - anchored glycoproteins sedimentable at 10000 g ( micro - vesicles ) and 100000 g ( nanovesicles ) [ 24 , 41 ] . We observed that heat - shock treatment of T lymphoma cells at 42 (cid:176) C for 15 min can induce vesiculation similar to that induced by the cholesterol - binding agent saponin , a phenomenon that is augmented only marginally by Ca (cid:35) + ions ( Figure 3 ) . In contrast , the pore - forming and cholesterol - binding agent SLO released such vesicles only in the presence of Ca (cid:35) + ions . In all these cases most of the Thy - 1 was pelleted at 100000 g and only a negligible quantity was recovered in the supernatant ( results not shown ) , indicating that most of the released Thy - 1 was in the form of sedimentable membrane vesicles . To examine the vesicular or non - vesicular nature of the MBCD - released membrane components , sequential sedimen - tation at diﬀerent centrifugal forces was performed ( Figure 4A ) . Most of the GM1 was released as vesicular complexes sedi - menting at 100000 g ( P100 ) , because only a very small amount was present in the 250000 g supernatant ( S250 ) . In contrast , a minor proportion of Thy - 1 and substantial amounts of Lck and Fyn were sedimented at 100000 g . Increasing the centrifugation to 250000 g did not sediment a further subset of these molecules ( Figure 4A ) , whereas under similar conditions most of the Triton X - 100 - released Thy - 1 and Lck were sedimentable ( results not shown ) . In sucrose density gradients , these diﬀerent sedimentable 437 Eﬀects of cyclodextrin on sphingolipid microdomains Figure 4 MBCD - released , plasma membrane - associated molecules are heterogeneous in their physical properties ( A ) Sedimentability of Thy - 1 , GM1 and Src - family PTKs . After treatment of 10 8 P1798 cells with 20 mM MBCD at 37 (cid:176) C for 30 min in a 5 ml volume , the 2000 g cell - free supernatant ( S2 ) was subjected to sequential centrifugation at 10000 g , 100000 g and 250000 g . The pellet at each step was resuspended in the original volume of TKM buﬀer . An equal volume ( 20 ml ) of the supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fractions from each sedimentation step ( S10 , P10 ; S100 , P100 ; S250 , P250 ) were tested for Thy - 1 and for Lck and Fyn kinases by Western blotting . GM1 was detected by dot - blotting from 5 ml ( undiluted ) and 1 ml ( diluted 1 : 5 ) of the samples with HRP - conjugated cholera toxin . ( B ) Buoyancy in sucrose density gradient . P100 or S250 fractions from ( A ) ( 1 ml of each ) were subjected to equilibrium gradient centrifugation and the presence of the indicated molecules in the gradient fractions was tested as described for Figure 2 . Figure 5 Effects of MBCD on endothelial cells ( A ) MBCD releases GPI - anchored CD59 . ECV304 human endothelial cells grown to conﬂuency in Petri dishes 10 cm in diameter were washed in PBS and incubated in 5 ml of 20 mM MBCD in PBS for 30 min at 37 (cid:176) C . The cell - free supernatant ( 2000 g ; S2 ) was subjected to sequential centrifugation at 10000 g , 100000 g and 250000 g . The pellet at each step was resuspended in the original volume of PBS . The cell pellet was sequentially lysed in 1 ml of 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ( TX ) and 1 % ( w / v ) SDS as described for Figure 1 . The supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fractions ( 20 ml of each ) from each sedimentation step ( S10 , P10 ; S100 , P100 ; S250 , P250 ) , and the Triton X - 100 and SDS lysates , were tested for CD59 , caveolin and CD44 by Western blotting . ( B ) Eﬀect of MBCD on the morphology of ECV304 cells . Conﬂuent cultures of ECV304 cells were washed in PBS and incubated with 5 or 20 mM MBCD in PBS at 37 (cid:176) C for 30 min and examined by phase - contrast microscopy . Magniﬁcation (cid:172) 100 . and non - sedimentable fractions were again separated into het - erogeneous subsets of molecules ( Figure 4B ) . Thy - 1 distributed into low - density and high - density fractions in the 100000 g pellet ( P100 ) and 250000 g supernatant ( S250 ) asin theﬁrst supernatant ( S2 ) ( compare Figure 2A ) . In contrast , all of the Lck in both the P100 and S250 fractions was not buoyant and remained in the sample loading zone ( Figure 4B ) . These results suggest that in the process of extracting cholesterol , MBCD releases GPI - 438 S . Ilangumaran and D . C . Hoessli Figure 6 MBCD extracts cholesterol from DRMs without affecting the buoyant properties of Thy - 1 and GM1 ( A ) Aliquots of total plasma membrane and DRMs ( sedimented from pooled low - density fractions 3 – 5 from a gradient of Triton X - 100 ( TX - 100 ) - lysed cells as shown in Figure 2B ) containing equivalent amounts of total protein were treated with the indicated concentrations of MBCD in TKM buﬀer for 30 min at 37 (cid:176) C . The amount of Thy - 1 in the sedimentable membrane complexes was tested by Western blotting . ( B ) Lipids from the sedimented membrane com - plexes were extracted and the amount of cholesterol remaining was analysed by TLC as described in the Experimental section . ( C ) Gradient - isolated DRMs from 10 8 Triton X - 100 - lysed cells were sedimented , resuspended in 1 ml of TKM buﬀer without or with 50 mM MBCD , and incubated for 30 min at 37 (cid:176) C . After a second gradient centrifugation the distribution of Thy - 1 and GM1 in pooled top ( tp , buoyant ) and bottom ( bm , non - buoyant ) fractions were analysed as described for Figure 2 . anchored proteins that are heterogeneous in their physical properties : ( 1 ) the buoyant Thy - 1 in P100 is similar to the Triton X - 100 - released vesicular Thy - 1 , whereas the non - buoyant Thy - 1 in P100 seems to remain associated with the Triton X - 100 - resistant membrane matrix , and ( 2 ) the non - buoyant Thy - 1 in S250 is likely to be completely solubilized , whereas the buoyant Thy - 1 in S250 might be complexed with sphingolipids , and possibly other lipids , in a non - vesicular form . When the human ECV304 endothelial cells expressing caveolin were incubated with MBCD , a signiﬁcant amount of GPI - anchored CD59 was released ( Figure 5A ) , which showed a sedimentation behaviour identical to that of MBCD - released Thy - 1 ( Figure 3A ) . Subsequent lysis in Triton X - 100 did not completely extract the remaining CD59 , unlike Thy - 1 in lympho - cytes . A negligible quantity of caveolin , but no CD44 , was released by MBCD ( Figure 5A ) , showing that the release of membrane proteins by MBCD was selective . About half of the caveolin and all of the CD44 were released by subsequent Triton X - 100 extraction , as reported previously [ 42 ] . Examination of the cellular morphology after MBCD treatment revealed discernible changes , including rounding up of cells and detachment from the substratum ( Figure 5B ) . MBCD releases cholesterol from DRMs but does not affect their buoyant properties About 60 % of the MBCD - released Thy - 1 was buoyant in density gradients , indicating that the association of Thy - 1 with membrane lipids was only partly disrupted by MBCD ( Figures 2A and 4B ) . This suggested either that MBCD is ineﬀective in extracting cholesterol from the GPI - rich membrane domains , or that the buoyant properties of these domains are independent of their cholesterol content . To investigate these possibilities , we treated total plasma membrane and DRMs with MBCD and evaluated the Thy - 1 and cholesterol contents of the sedimented membrane complexes . As shown in Figure 6 ( A ) , MBCD mark - edly decreased the amount of sedimentable Thy - 1 from total plasma membrane but not from the DRMs , suggesting het - erogeneity in the cholesterol (cid:125) lipid environment of Thy - 1 in lymphocyte plasma membranes . Nevertheless MBCD at 50 mM decreased the cholesterol contents of DRMs to almost the same extent as that of total plasma membranes ( Figure 6B ) . Lastly , we investigated the buoyant properties of Triton X - 100 - isolated DRM domain constituents with or without prior treatment with MBCD . Results presented in Figure 6 ( C ) show that the buoy - ancies of Thy - 1 and GM1 were not aﬀected by treatment with MBCD despite the loss of cholesterol . These results suggest that the cholesterol removed by MBCD is not required for deter - mining the buoyant properties of Triton X - 100 - isolated DRMs . DISCUSSION The bulk of the cellular cholesterol is localized in the plasma membrane [ 43 ] , where one of its functions is to maintain the liquid ordered state of sphingolipid microdomains [ 3 , 12 , 44 ] . Without cholesterol the hydrocarbon chains of sphingolipids would pack tightly to form a rigid gel - like phase . Hydrogen - bonding between the 3 - OH group of cholesterol and the amide group of sphingolipids , but not the ester bonds of glycero - phospholipids , presumably underlies the formation of sphingo - lipid – cholesterol liquid ordered domains [ 12 ] and contributes to their resistance to extraction with non - ionic detergent [ 45 , 46 ] . The second and main pool of plasma membrane cholesterol is found among the ﬂuid , liquid - crystalline - phase glycerophospho - lipids [ 12 ] and a third pool of cholesterol is postulated to exist between the sphingolipid rafts and the glycerophospholipid milieu to provide a smooth transition in the energy states of the two phases [ 12 , 47 ] . Mammalian GPI - anchored proteins usually have saturated acyl chains in their lipid anchor [ 48 ] and should ﬁnd the liquid ordered phase of sphingolipid - rich microdomains suitable for dynamic association [ 3 ] . The interaction of GPI - anchors with the 439 Eﬀects of cyclodextrin on sphingolipid microdomains sphingolipid microdomains occurs in the trans - Golgi network and the interacting molecules acquire their detergent - resistant properties during biosynthetic transport to the cell surface [ 7 ] . However , it should be noted that Triton X - 100 releases only a part of the GPI - anchored proteins as buoyant membrane com - plexes , whereas the remainder is bound to the membrane matrix still rich in GSLs ( reviewed in [ 49 ] ) , probably corresponding to plasma membrane stably linked to cellular superstructures . Treatment with MBCD followed by extraction with Triton X - 100 released most of the Thy - 1 from the cell surface ( Figure 1 ) , whereas even after two sequential extractions Triton X - 100 did not release Thy - 1 completely ( results not shown ) . It seems that the additional Thy - 1 released by MBCD originated from the Triton X - 100 - resistant membrane matrix . This is in line with earlier observations that extraction with Triton X - 100 in the presence of cholesterol - depleting saponin led to the complete release of Thy - 1 from mast cells [ 23 ] , alkaline phosphatase from transfected BeWo choriocarcinoma cells [ 20 ] and a number of GPI - anchored proteins from Madin – Darby canine kidney cells [ 22 ] . MBCD by itself released nearly half of the Thy - 1 molecules from the cell surface . However , the physical nature of MBCD - released Thy - 1 seems to be diﬀerent from that released by Triton X - 100 because it was mostly non - sedimentable and presumably not in a vesicular form , whereas almost all of the Triton X - 100 - released Thy - 1 was vesicular and sedimentable . Similarly , in equilibrium density gradients most of the Triton X - 100 - extracted Thy - 1 was buoyant , compared with only 60 % of the MBCD - released Thy - 1 . However , inclusion of all of the MBCD - released GM1 in the buoyant material strongly suggested that only 60 % of Thy - 1 was present as GSL – GPI - rich complexes of high lipid - to - protein ratio . The actual proportion of glycerophospholipids in these complexes and their acyl chain composition have not been investigated . Interestingly , most of the cholesterol ( more than 80 % ) as - sociated with Triton X - 100 - released vesicular complexes was still extractable by MBCD , but the remaining cholesterol resistant to MBCD extraction was suﬃcient to keep the DRM - associated Thy - 1 and GM1 buoyant ( Figure 6 ) . This stands in contrast with the observations made on whole cells and reconstituted model membranes , in which cholesterol depletion by saponin led to the complete solubilization of GPI - anchored proteins by non - ionic detergents [ 20 , 23 , 46 ] . Unlike saponin , MBCD does not insert into the plasma membrane yet it has been reported to be very potent in extracting cholesterol : more than 90 % depletion has been observed for erythrocytes [ 33 ] and inﬂuenza virus particles budding from Madin – Darby canine kidney cells [ 36 ] . Glycero - phospholipids and glycoproteins are also released after treatment with MBCD , although no direct binding of MBCD to glycero - phospholipids has been reported [ 50 ] . The release of non - cholesterol molecules from the plasma membrane by MBCD is thus likely to be indirect and to result from the disorganization brought about in the membrane by the removal of cholesterol . Non - ionic detergents ( Triton X - 100 and Nonidet P - 40 ) include glycerophospholipids in mixed micelles , whereas MBCD releases them indirectly . In erythrocytes , where the plasma membrane interacts tightly with the cytoskeleton , MBCD nevertheless releases 30 % of the total glycerophospholipids [ 33 ] and it is expected that in lymphocyte membranes , which are less stably anchored to the cytoskeleton , the MBCD - induced release of glycerophospholipids will be greater . We can envisage that after the extraction of lymphocyte membranes with MBCD , glycero - phospholipids are released from bilayers and sphingolipids enriched in the remaining sedimentable vesicles . However , this does not exclude the possibility of the presence of glycero - Figure 7 Hypothetical model for the organization of sphingolipids , chol - esterol and GPI - anchored and transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane on the basis of their behaviour towards Triton X - 100 and MBCD Sphingolipids , cholesterol and GPI - anchored proteins interact to form the core of the sphingolipid domains ( SPL domain ) . GSLs and GPI - anchored proteins within this core are resistant to Triton X - 100 ( TX - 100 ) , and MBCD depletes all but a small fraction of cholesterol associated with the sphingolipids . Cholesterol outside this core seems to be completely released by MBCD . The presence of a cholesterol - rich annulus is inferred from the diﬀerence in the buoyant properties of MBCD - and Triton X - 100 - released Thy - 1 . Signiﬁcant amounts of Thy - 1 should reside within this annulus and be releasable by MBCD but not by Triton X - 100 [ compare the buoyant properties of Thy - 1 released by MBCD from DRMs ( Figure 6 ) and from whole cells ( Figure 2 ) ] . Most of the transmembrane proteins are released by both Triton X - 100 and MBCD and reside in the glycerophospholipid - rich plasma membrane region , which contains as much cholesterol as the sphingolipid - rich regions . Solubility in Triton X - 100 and sensitivity to release by MBCD of the respective component of these predicted membrane subdomains are indicated . The inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane corresponding to the outer - leaﬂet sphingolipid - rich regions remains poorly deﬁned ( indicated with ‘ ? ’ ) . phospholipids in the MBCD - resistant membranes , as in DRMs [ 7 ] . Actually , when we removed cholesterol from DRMs with MBCD , the buoyant properties of Thy - 1 were not altered , strongly suggesting that after treatments with Triton X - 100 or MBCD the resistant membranes harbouring Thy - 1 owed their buoyancy essentially to sphingolipids , and secondarily to glycero - phospholipids . We propose that the MBCD - resistant cholesterol in the total plasma membrane or Triton X - 100 - isolated DRMs represents the cholesterol tightly associated with the sphingolipids to form the core of the sphingolipid microdomains , whereas the rest of the plasma membrane cholesterol is readily extracted by MBCD ; the MBCD - extracted cholesterol in the Triton X - 100 - isolated DRMs might represent the ‘third pool’ at the boundary of the sphingolipid microdomains discussed by Brown [ 12 ] . These possibilities are represented schematically in Figure 7 . This model proposes that the Triton X - 100 - isolated DRMs contain both the core sphingolipid microdomain and the surrounding cholesterol - rich annulus . The fact that MBCD released Thy - 1 ( as buoyant and non - buoyant fractions ) and GM1 from whole cells but not from Triton X - 100 - isolated DRMs suggests that ( 1 ) Thy - 1 and GM1 are also present in the annulus surrounding the core of the sphingolipid domains and ( 2 ) the removal of glycerophos - pholipids from the annulus by Triton X - 100 might render them refractory to subsequent MBCD - mediated release . An assess - ment of the role of glycerophospholipids in the buoyancy of GPI - anchored proteins and association with the sphingolipid , 440 S . Ilangumaran and D . C . Hoessli cholesterol - rich environment would require the use of liposomes with deﬁned lipid compositions and containing inserted GPI - anchored proteins . In conclusion , the depletion of membrane cholesterol by the surface - acting MBCD alone appears to disrupt selectively the glycerophospholipid - rich regions of the membrane , sparing the sphingolipid - rich regions . This apparently more stringent approach to sphingolipid microdomain isolation by MBCD still shows that GSLs , GPI - anchored surface receptors and Src - family PTKs co - isolate in the form of buoyant vesicles , and thus contributes to validating the previous work with non - ionic detergents .
