Submitted to Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America The basis of quantitative regulation of gene expression is still poorly understood . In Arabidopsis thaliana quantitative varia - tion in expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) inﬂuences the timing of ﬂowering . In ambient temperatures FLC expression is quantitatively modulated by a chromatin silencing mechanism involving alternative polyadenylation of antisense transcripts . In - vestigation of this mechanism unexpectedly showed that RNA Polymerase II ( Pol II ) occupancy changes at FLC did not reﬂect RNA fold changes . Mathematical modeling of these transcriptional dynamics predicted a tight coordination of transcriptional initi - ation and elongation . This prediction was validated by detailed measurements of total and chromatin - bound FLC intronic RNA ; a methodology appropriate for analyzing elongation rate changes in a range of organisms . Transcription initiation was found to vary (cid:24) 25 - fold with elongation rate varying (cid:24) 8 - 12 - fold . Premature sense transcript termination contributed very little to expression differences . This quantitative variation in transcription was coin - cident with variation in H3K36me3 and H3K4me2 over the FLC gene body . We propose different chromatin states coordinately inﬂuence transcriptional initiation and elongation rates and that this coordination is likely to be a general feature of quantitative gene regulation in a chromatin context . chromatin j alternative polyadenylation j COOLAIR j autonomous pathway j FCA Introduction The influence of chromatin on transcription and co - transcriptional processing is of central importance in the regulation of gene expression ( 1 , 2 ) . An intensively studied example where the local chromatin state is considered to influence transcription in Arabidopsis is FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) . FLC encodes a MADS - box transcription factor and acts as a floral repressor ( 3 , 4 ) . FLC expression is tuned by different genetic pathways : FRIGIDA activates FLC expression through a mechanism requiring Trithorax homologues , Paf1C and SDG8 , an H3K36 methyltransferase ( 5 ) . FLC expression is repressed by the autonomous pathway and vernalization ( 5 ) . Both these repressive pathways involve a group of antisense long non - coding transcripts collectively termed COOLAIR , which initiate immediately downstream of the poly A site at the 3 ’ end of FLC . These antisense transcripts terminate at either proximal sites internal to the FLC gene , or distal sites within the FLC promoter ( 6 , 7 ) . Mutation of autonomous pathway components , including the RNA binding proteins FCA and FPA and the conserved components of the 3 ’ processing complex FY , Cstf64 and Cstf77 leads to relative reduction in use of the proximal polyadenylation sites and increased FLC sense expression ( reviewed in ( 8 ) ) . FCA localizes to FLC chromatin near the proximal poly A sites ( 9 ) , and this together with the fact that PRP8 and CDKC2 ( P - TEFb component ) , identified in FCA suppressor screens ( 10 , 11 ) , both require COOLAIR to repress FLC , supports the idea that promotion of proximal polyadenylation of COOLAIR is directly linked to reduced FLC expression . FLD , an H3K4me2 demethylase , also functions in this mechanism and fld is the most effective suppressor of FCA function at FLC ( 9 ) . FLD modulates H3K4me2 levels in the gene body of FLC , however , how FCA functions with FLD to achieve FLC repression remains to be fully elucidated . Here , we investigate how FCA and FLD transcriptionally repress FLC through analysis of Pol II occupancy . We use these data together with RNA measurements to parameterize an an - alytic mathematical model of FLC transcription . Model predic - tions are then tested through detailed measurements of intronic total and chromatin - bound RNA levels . This methodology is very appropriate for evaluating elongation rate changes in whole organisms where pulse - chase experiments are technically unfea - sible . At FLC , we find that both FCA and FLD - mediated re - pression occurs not only through reduced transcription initiation , but also through a coordinately reduced Pol II elongation rate . We propose that chromatin modifications at FLC induced by FCA and FLD , influenced by the antisense transcript processing , coordinately change initiation and elongation to quantitatively regulate the transcriptional output of the locus . Results RNA fold changes do not reflect Pol II occupancy changes Measurement of steady state spliced FLC and unspliced FLC RNA showed an increase in expression of (cid:24) 20 - 25 fold between Col and fca - 9 and fld - 4 ( Fig . 1A ) . We reasoned that if this was caused by a 25x change in transcription initiation a 25x increase in Pol II levels would be found at FLC , assuming transcript half - lives , splicing / 3 ’ processing efficiency , Pol II processivity and Signiﬁcance The textbook view of how transcription is quantitatively reg - ulated is through changes in transcription initiation . However , the arrangement of DNA in chromatin in eukaryotes and the frequent occurrence of non - coding transcripts add to the complexity of transcriptional regulation . Here , we explore the quantitative transcriptional regulation of FLC , a gene impor - tant for developmental timing in Arabidopsis . FLC expression correlates with altered antisense transcript processing and different chromatin states . Through experiments and mathe - matical modeling we discover that transcription initiation and elongation are tightly coordinated and both are inﬂuenced by the chromatin state at the locus . Modulation of the chromatin environment by non - coding transcripts to coordinately inﬂu - ence transcription initiation and elongation could be a general mechanism to regulate quantitative transcriptional output .

Large increases in RNA are associated with small changes in Pol II occupancy ( A ) RNA fold up - regulation in fca - 9 and ﬂd - 4 mutants compared to Col : spliced and unspliced FLC ( (cid:24) 25x ) , proximal ( (cid:24) 2x ) and distal COOLAIR ( (cid:24) 13x ) .

The bar charts at the bottom indicate Pol II levels at various control genes . Three overlapping primer pairs are used to measure IGN5 expression ( P1 - P3 ) . Values are mean ± s . e . m . from 2 independent samples , with data presented as the ratio of Pol II at FLC / input at FLC to Pol II at ACT7 ( - 995 ) / input at ACT7 ( - 995 ) . elongation rates are unaffected in fca - 9 and fld - 4 ( Fig . 1B ) . However , both total Pol II and productively elongating Pol II ( Ser2 - P ) showed relatively small changes ( 2 - 3x ) across FLC in the different genotypes ( Fig . 1C , D ; Fig . S1A , B ) . We ruled out a number of technical issues with Pol II ChIP that could have led to an underestimation of Pol II occupancy . First , measurements on a highly expressed gene ( ACT7 ) and a Pol IV / V transcribed region ( IGN5 ) showed that a wide dynamic range ( > 1000x by comparing levels at ACT7 to IGN5 ) could be detected in the Pol II ChIP assay ( Fig . 1C , D ) . Pol II levels at FLC were well above background at IGN5 ( Fig . 1C , D ; Fig . S1 ) . Second , specific dilutions of FLC chromatin , without changing the overall amount of chromatin , showed rough linearity between the Pol II ChIP signal and the Pol II concentration at FLC ( Fig . S2 ) . Third , cell - specific FLC ex - pressionvariation is also highly unlikely tounderlie this difference in RNA and Pol II up - regulation , as both assays use whole plant seedlings and thus reflect population averages . Based on these observations , we conclude that FCA / FLD - mediated changes in FLC transcription are unlikely to occur solely through changes in transcription initiation . FLC transcriptional dynamics can be explained by coordina - tion of initiation and elongation To further understand how FCA and FLD - mediated FLC repression occurs at a transcriptional level , we developed an analytical mathematical model of the transcriptional dynamics at FLC by incorporating sense FLC and COOLAIR initiation , elongation and termination ( Fig . 2A ; see Supporting Informa - tion for complete description ) . The experimental data described above were used as model inputs . This strategy enabled us to Fig . 2 .

S4 . can be described mathematically as a ratio of the initiation rate ( F ) over the elongation rate ( v ) ( 12 ) . Since our ChIP signal is not strand specific , we summed the sense and antisense model Pol II levels to generate a model total Pol II profile along FLC ( Fig . 2B ) . The small increase of Pol II ChIP signal in the transcriptionally active fca - 9 and fld - 4 mutants ( Fig . 1C , D ; Fig . S1 ) is explained by the model through a coordinated increase in initiation and elongation rates ( Fig . 2B , C ) . The model also reproduced the FLC spliced , unspliced and COOLAIR fold up - regulation in fca - 9 and fld - 4 ( Fig . 1A ) , where a 25x fold increase in sense Pol II initiation required an 8 - 12x fold faster rate of elongation to quantitatively fit the Pol II occupancy increase ( Fig . 2D ) . Elevated Pol II levels at the 3 ’ of FLC resulted from sense termination and proximal antisense transcription ( Fig . 2A - D ) . Our model does not take into account transcriptional interference ( TI ) between sense FLC and COOLAIR ( see Discussion ) . Using an experimentally determined value for the termination rate 1 / 50 s - 1 ( 13 ) , absolute elongation rates could be inferred from the model , yielding 0 . 2 - 0 . 4 kb / min ( Col ) and 1 . 8 - 3 . 6 kb / min ( fca - 9 and fld - 4 ) . These correspond well to values found in other organisms ( 14 - 17 ) . The excellent fit of the experimental data strongly supports a model where FLC transcriptional dynamics are governed by coordinated changes in initiation and elongation . Co - transcriptional splicing , combined with coordinated ini - tiation and elongation , generate distinctive patterns of RNA up - regulation along FLC intron1 We next tested the predicted coordinate increase in initiation and elongation rates experimentally . Measurement of elongation rates on a subset of highly expressed , long mammalian genes ( > 50 kb ) has been achieved using GRO - seq ( 14 ) . This technique involves inhibition of elongation and then release and relies on rapid removal of an inhibitor that is difficult in whole organisms ( 15 , 16 ) . We tried an alternative approach via generation of an FLC - MS2 fusion ( 13 ) , but this was not expressed at a sufficiently high level to be useful . To overcome these limitations , we used our theoretical model to make specific predictions with regards to intronic FLC RNA production , which we then tested experi - mentally . If introns are spliced co - transcriptionally once Pol II has reached the 3 ’ end of the intron , then nascent RNA from the 5 ’ end of the intron resides on the chromatin longer than that from the 3 ’ end . This generates a nascent RNA profile along an intron with declining levels from the 5 ’ to 3 ’ end ( 17 , 18 ) . An analytic mathematical analysis ( Fig 3A , Supporting Information ) predicts that the ratio of Pol II initiation ( F ) over the elongation rate ( v ) determines the slope of the nascent intronic RNA levels between the 5 ’ to 3 ’ ends , whilst the initiation rate over the splicing rate ( k s ) determines the levels of completely transcribed , unspliced 273274275276277278279280281282283284285286287288289290291292293294295296297 298 299300301302303304305306307308309310311312313314315316317318319320321322 323324325326327328329330331332333334335 336 337338339340 Footline Author PNAS Issue Date Volume Issue Number 3 341342343344345346347348349350351352353354355356357358359360361362363364365 366 367368369370371372373374375376377378379380381382383384385386387388389390 391392393394395396397398399400401402403 404 405406407408 Submission PDF Fig . 4 .

( B ) Working model of how FLC expression is quantitatively regulated through coordination of transcription initiation and elongation . In the absense of FCA / FLD , H3K36me3 is increased at FLC through SDG8 function and this promotes fast transcription initiation and elongation . In presense of FCA / FLD , antisense processing triggers a reduction of H3K4me2 , loss of H3K36me3 and an increase in H3K27me3 , which reduces transcription initiation and slows elongation . of the initiation rate to the splicing rate , and independent of the elongation rate . Away from the 3 ’ end of the intron , transcripts emerging from Pol II still transcribing the intron will also con - tribute to nascent RNA levels , and hence the ratio of the initiation rate to the elongation rate will also be important ( Fig . 3A ) . Taking into account both increased initiation and elongation rates in the fca - 9 mutant compared to Col ( Fig . 3B ) , this analysis enabled us to predict a spatially varying fold up - regulation of nascent RNA along FLC intron1 ( Fig . 3B ) . We tested this key model prediction by measuring the chromatin - bound RNA profile at FLC ( Fig . 3C ; Fig . S4 ) . Com - paring fca - 9 to Col , the chromatin - bound fold up - regulation inside exon1 was much larger than at the exon1 - intron1 junc - tion ( Fig . S4A , G ) , suggesting that splicing of intron1 does occur mostly co - transcriptionally . In the first kb of intron1 , as predicted by the model , there was only a small fold increase in fca - 9 as compared to Col ( Fig . 3C ; Fig . S4A ) . This is due to the depen - dence on the ratios of the initiation and elongation rates and their coordinated increases in fca - 9 ( Fig . 3B ) . By contrast , the fold up - regulation was much larger close to the intron acceptor site in fca - 9 . This is in agreement with the model , where we used the experimentally determined splicing rate of 1 / 100 s - 1 ( 17 ) for both Col and fca - 9 , with other parameters determined from our prior fitting to the Pol II ChIP data ( Supporting Information ) . Importantly , the chromatin - bound RNA profile along intron1 is not flat , which is what would be predicted without changes to the elongation rates between fca - 9 and Col . We also fitted the model to the chromatin - bound RNA data directly using nonlinear regression ( R 2 = 0 . 89 , F - statistic : p = 3x10 - 14 ) . This procedure also led to the conclusion that sig - nificant elongation rate changes ( fold = 9 . 8 ± 3 . 8 ( mean ± s . e . m . ) , p = 0 . 03 ) are required to explain the profile ( Supporting Informa - tion ) . Importantly , this method does not rely on the specific values 409410411412413414415416417418419420421422423424425426427428429430431432433 434 435436437438439440441442443444445446447448449450451452453454455456457458 459460461462463464465466467468469470471 472 473474475476 4 www . pnas . org - - - - - - Footline Author 477478479480481482483484485486487488489490491492493494495496497498499500501 502 503504505506507508509510511512513514515516517518519520521522523524525526 527528529530531532533534535536537538539 540 541542543544 Submission PDF of splicing and elongation rates and is independent of Pol II ChIP data , and thus provides additional evidence for the elongation rate changes . Interestingly , we observed less increase in fold up - regulation towards the 3 ’ end of intron1 in fld - 4 as compared to fca - 9 ( Fig . 3C ; Fig . S4A ) . Given the fold change close to an intron acceptor site is more sensitive to splicing rather than elongation rate changes ( Fig . 3B ) , we examined if a splicing rate change specific to fld - 4 could explain its differential fold up - regulation pattern from fca - 9 ( Materials and Methods ; Supporting Information ) . Indeed , we found that we could fit the fld - 4 profile in our model by incorporating a 2 fold faster splicing rate ( 1 / 50 s ‑ 1 ) in fld - 4 ( Fig . 3C ) , whilst keeping all other parameters unchanged . We further verified this model prediction of an increased splicing rate in fld - 4 by measuring the splicing efficiency of FLC intron1 . As predicted , the efficiency was increased 1 . 8 fold in fld - 4 ( Fig . 3D ) , but not significantly altered in fca - 9 ( p = 0 . 1 , two - sided unpaired t - test ) . A simple alternative model with unchanged splicing and elongation rates between Col and fld - 4 would produce a constant chromatin - bound RNA fold - change across intron1 . That would be consistent with the chromatin - bound RNA data set in isolation ( Fig . 3C ) , but implies a change in the initiation rates of (cid:24) 7 fold ( Supporting Information ) , which is inconsistent with our earlier spliced and unspliced FLC RNA fold changes ( Fig . 1A ) . To further support these conclusions we investigated the total intronic RNA profile ( Fig . 3E , F ; Fig . S4 ) . Such measurements include intron lariat degradation intermediates , which are present in the total but not chromatin - bound RNA fraction ( Fig . 3E ) ( 17 ) . Assuming that lariat degradation occurs from 5 ’ to 3 ’ , lariat RNA at the 3 ’ generally exists for longer than that at the 5 ’ . This generates a lariat RNA profile with increasing levels from the 5 ’ to 3 ’ end ( Fig . 3E ) . Importantly , incorporating this lariat population into the total intronic RNA fold upregulation between fca - 9 and Col , without altering the model parameterization that explained the Pol II and chromatin - bound RNA , produced a predicted profile that is qualitatively different to that found for the chromatin - bound RNA ( Fig . 3B , E ) . This prediction was also validated experimentally ( Fig . 3F ) . Compared to the chromatin - bound RNA profile , there was a significantly larger fold increase in the first 2kb of the total intronic RNA profile ( p = 8x10 - 7 and 4x10 - 7 for fca - 9 and fld - 4 respectively , two - sided Welch ’ s t - test ) ( Fig . 3C , F ; Fig . S4A , B ) . In the model , we could generate such a profile , by solely incorporating 5 ’ to 3 ’ intron lariat degra - dation with rate up to 1 . 5 bp / s ( 19 ) , in line with experimentally determined intron half - lives ( 17 ) . Potential additional presence of 3 ’ to 5 ’ degradation ( 19 ) with a rate up to 1 bp / s did not alter our conclusions ( Supporting Information ) . The profiles for total intronic RNA look very similar between fca - 9 and fld - 4 ( Fig . 3F ) , in contrast to the chromatin - bound data ( Fig . 3C ) . This similarity is because the lariat RNA effectively extends the half - life of intronic RNA and therefore reduces the effect of the differential splicing rates between fca - 9 and fld - 4 ( Fig . 3F ) . Taken together , our total and chromatin - bound intronic RNA profiles provide strong evidence that repression of FLC involves a coordinated change of both the initiation and elongation rates . Moreover , the methods we developed here can be used to infer elongation rate changes in whole organisms where pulse - chase experiments are not feasible . Sense premature termination contributes little to FLC re - pression Previous reports have linked the elongation rate to either Pol II processivity ( 20 ) or early termination ( 21 ) . In these scenarios , Pol II would terminate prematurely as a result of slow elongation . Our previous analysis did not require any such premature ter - mination . Moreover , at an intuitive level , premature termination should lead to declining levels of Pol II from 5 ’ to 3 ’ in the re - pressed case ( Col ) ( Fig . S5A ; Supporting Information ) . However , we found no evidence for this in our Pol II ChIP assay ( Fig . 1C , D ; Fig . S1 ) and no short transcripts had been detected by northern blot using an FLC intron 1 probe ( 22 ) . These findings suggest that premature termination contributes little to FLC repression . To further confirm this conclusion , we undertook 3 ’ RACE to map transcripts ending within the promoter - proximal region of FL C . We could detect polyadenylated transcripts that terminated within FLC intron1 . These transcripts all contained FLC exon1 and were mostly alternatively spliced with the same donor site but with a different acceptor site , as compared to the conventional FLC intron1 ( Fig . S5B ) . By monitoring the alternatively spliced intron associated with premature termination , we found these transcripts are of lower abundance than unspliced intron1 in Col , fca - 9 and 35S : : FCA ( Fig . S5E ) . Therefore , sense premature termination occurs only occasionally at FLC and is not a major contributor to FLC repression . Co - transcriptional decay of nascent transcripts by 5 ’ to 3 ’ exonucleases has also been proposed to influence transcriptional output ( 23 , 24 ) . In such a scenario , the degradation of RNA should also lead Pol II to terminate prematurely , and therefore to declining levels of Pol II from 5 ’ to 3 ’ in the repressed state ( Col ) , which is again inconsistent with our Pol II ChIP data . In addition , we analysed FLC expression in mutants defective for these functions ( xrn2 - 1 , xrn3 - 3 ) ( 25 ) in Arabidopsis and found no increase in FLC nascent or fully spliced FLC RNA levels ( Fig . S6 ) . Therefore , such a decay pathway is unlikely to play a major role in determining the overall transcriptional dynamics at FLC . FLD alters the local chromatin state to influence transcrip - tional output via coordinated changes in initiation and elonga - tion We therefore continued with our investigation of coordinated initiation and elongation rates by FCA / FLD - mediated changes in chromatin modifications . We analyzed the localization of the histone demethylase FLD at FLC using a complementing FLD - TAP fusion expressed from its endogenous regulatory sequences ( Fig . S7A - C ) . FLD shows the highest enrichment at FLC (cid:24) 1kb to 3kb downstream of the transcription start site ( TSS ) ( Fig . 4A ) . This localization is consistent with the increased H3K4me2 in the FLC gene body ( 1kb to 4kb beyond the TSS ) in the fld - 4 mutant ( Fig . 4B ) . Loss of FLD , and indeed similarly FCA , resulted in changes in a number of other chromatin modifications ( Fig . 4C - F ) . H3K4me3 and H3Ac increased around the FLC sense TSS ( Fig . 4C , D ) , coincident with lower H3K4me2 in this region . The relatively small changes in H3K4me2 were correlated with much larger changes in H3K36me3 and the mirror modi - fication H3K27me3 ( Fig . 4E , F ) along the whole gene . Loss of the H3K36me3 methyltransferase in sdg8 confers early flowering and low FLC expression ( 26 - 28 ) . Combination of fca with sdg8 results in an FLC level and profile of total RNA across intron1 similar to that in Col ( Fig . 5A , Fig . S8 ) . Therefore , loss of SDG8 - directed H3K36me3 is also likely to coordinately reduce Pol II initiation and elongation rates at FLC . Taken together , our data suggest that activities downstream of antisense processing act antagonistically to SDG8 function , leading to coordinated changes in initiation and elongation at FLC ( Fig . 5B ) . Discussion Understanding how flowering time in plants is regulated has led into a detailed mechanistic dissection of the regulation of the Arabidopsis thaliana floral repressor FLC . Genetic screens have identified RNA processing factors that target antisense tran - scripts of FLC and histone modifiers as important components quantitatively repressing FLC expression . Here , using a combi - nation of mathematical modeling and experiments , we show FLC regulation involves coordination of transcription initiation with elongation . This may be a general feature of gene regulation as evidenced by genome - wide correlations between gene expression , 545546547548549550551552553554555556557558559560561562563564565566567568569 570 571572573574575576577578579580581582583584585586587588589590591592593594 595596597598599600601602603604605606607 608 609610611612 Footline Author PNAS Issue Date Volume Issue Number 5 613614615616617618619620621622623624625626627628629630631632633634635636637 638 639640641642643644645646647648649650651652653654655656657658659660661662 663664665666667668669670671672673674675 676 677678679680 Submission PDF gene body Pol II levels and Pol II elongation rates found in yeast and mammalian cells ( 14 , 29 ) . How Pol II initiation and elongation are coordinated is still unclear . In E . coli , newly initiated RNA Polymerases can facilitate elongation of the leading Polymerase ( 30 ) . Such a mechanism is unlikely to be the case at FLC , since FLC is not highly expressed even in its active state ( as compared to Actin ) . Elongation is likely influenced by Pol II CTD modifications and the chromatin state ( 31 , 32 ) , both directly through nucleosome turnover dynamics and indirectly via differential recruitment of elongation factors . In Arabidopsis , elongation factor TFIIS is required for elongation of many genes but a tfIIS mutant does not show changed FLC expression ( 10 , 33 , 34 ) . However , FLC expression is particularly sensitive to reduced amounts of the histone chaperone FACT ( 35 ) , so it will be interesting to test if FACT is required for the fast elongation observed in fca - 9 and the coordination mechanism . We have found here that FLD recruitment , changed H3K4me2 and the resulting changes in H3K36me3 at FLC are likely im - portant for this coordination . Our analysis of SDG8 suggests that H3K36me3 is essential to maintain both a fast initiation and elongation rate at FLC ( Fig . 5B ) . We therefore propose that changed histone modifications actively influence FLC regulation and are not just a reflection of transcription . Our results raise the question whether there is a general need to coordinate transcription initiation and elongation . Control of gene expression may necessitate such coordination as , for instance , a slow elongation rate relative to initiation would cause an accumulation of Pol II at the promoter that would limit the number of additional Pol II molecules that can initiate through occlusion ( 36 ) . Such a limit might become even more stringent due to bursty initiation or Pol II pausing / backtracking during elongation ( 37 ) . Furthermore , antisense transcription might in - duce a limit on initiation rates in order to prevent the occurrence of TI ( 38 ) . However , 5 ’ pausing of Pol II is not a feature at FLC ( as shown by the absence of a 5 ’ peak in Pol II ChIP ) , arguing against occlusion effects . The expression of sense and antisense is positively correlated at FLC , arguing against a major role for TI . Instead we suggest that altered elongation rates reinforce selection of different antisense isoforms , which can then recruit different chromatin regulators to the gene , thereby modulating coordinated transcription initiation and elongation ( Fig . 5B ) . An important question now is to understand how far the lessons from FLC reflect regulation mechanisms both genome - and organism - wide . Coordination between initiation and elongation could gen - erally enhance transcription efficiency , potentially to minimize transcription - associated genome instability ( 39 ) . Modulation of the deposition of different histone modifiers by non - coding tran - scripts may be a general mechanism to coordinately affect Pol II initiation and elongation and thus quantitatively modulate transcriptional output .
