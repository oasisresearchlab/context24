It is the sixth most common type of malignancy , with more than 887 , 000 cases and 450 , 000 deaths every year ( Ahmed et al . , 2020 ) . The known hazard factors for HNSCC include cigarette smoking , human papilloma virus ( HPV ) infection , and alcohol consumption ( Magnes et al . , 2017 ) . Regrettably , there are few clinical manifestations in the early stages of cancer , leading to the majority of HNSCC patients being diagnosed at a later stage . As a result , the 5 - years survival rate is less than 50 % , and the survival rate for patients with local recurrence and metastasis is even lower , at 35 % ( Chin et al . , 2005 ) . Once advanced , treatment may affect organ function and impair speech and swallowing , resulting in a loss of quality of life ( Coskun et al . , 2015 ; Bressan et al . , 2016 ) . In recent times , it has been determined that undifferentiated cell populations with stem cell - like properties in HNSCC are major factors in ﬂ uencing recurrence and progression . Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) are a few highly tumorigenic cancer cells that are self - renewing and capable of differentiating into cells that make up most tumors ( Patel et al . , 2014 ) . The resistance of current treatments , such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy , is attributed to the ability of the CSC subgroup to coordinate recurrence and promote metastasis , which is important for treatment ( Davis et al . , 2010 ) . A recent study found that overexpression of retinoid X receptor - α ( RXR α ) can extend the CSC - like properties of HNSCC cells , while knockdown of RXR α can inhibit stem cells , whereas Wnt signaling pathways are induced by cisplatin in CSCs ( Jiang et al . , 2018 ) . Similarly , the study also reported that MTA3 can inhibit tongue squamous cell carcinoma ( TSCC ) CSC characteristics and tumor growth by down - regulating key regulators of CSCs SOX210 plasticity ( Yao et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , the study also found that YAP1 / SOX2 transcriptional stress triggers activation of reprogrammable HNSCC to obtain stems , while triple SOX2 , CD44v9 , and YAP1 may be useful for selecting high - risk CSCs with normal function ( Omori et al . , 2019 ) . Overexpression of PLOD2 enhanced CSC - like properties of Hep - 2 , activated Wnt signaling pathway , and activated laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( LSCC ) resistance in vitro and in vivo ( Sheng et al . , 2019 ) . In this era of big data , bioinformatics analysis and microarray technology have been extensively used to simultaneously identify thousands of genes data at the genomic level . A study was carried out to quantify stemness based on a variety of platform analyses FIGURE 1 | The characteristics of the mRNAsi . ( A ) .

Cancer Stem Cells in HNSCC integrated methylation and transcriptome and transcription factor binding sites . mRNA expression - based stemness index ( mRNAsi ) from several tumors were collected , so mRNAsi data were downloaded for in - depth analysis ( Pan et al . , 2019 ) . Higher mRNAsi scores are related to greater tumor dedifferentiation and active biological processes in CSCs , as re ﬂ ected by histopathological grades . Weighted Gene Co - Expression Network Analysis ( WGCNA ) identi ﬁ es a co - expressed set of genes , a collection called a module that can be correlated with phenotypic data to explore potential marker genes ( Langfelder and Horvath , 2008 ) . In this study , we make use of RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) data from the cancer genome atlas ( TCGA ) and determine key genes linked to stemness by combining WGCNA with HNSCC mRNAsi . Our ﬁ ndings will be of great signi ﬁ cance in expounding the pathogenesis of CSC - related genes in HNSCC and in selecting useful biomarkers . METHODS Gene Information and Bioinformatics Analysis Information about gene expression ( 529 tissues ) and comparative clinical data ( 378 cases ) were downloaded from the TCGA - HNSCC cohort . The clinicopathological data were also collected . Data were examined with the R ( version 3 . 5 . 3 ) . We use Perl language for data matrix and data analyzing based on the p < 0 . 05 . Missing data is processed FIGURE 2 | The results of the WGCNA analysis . ( A ) . By cluster analysis , DEGs with a variance of up to 25 % were placed in one module , and we obtained 16 modules for the following analysis ; ( B ) .

Moreover , the brown module showed a relatively high negative correlation with mRNAsi , with a correlation to - 0 . 8 ; ( C ) .

Cancer Stem Cells in HNSCC using a table - by - list deletion technique , where if any single value is missing , the data excludes the entire sample from the analysis . mRNAsi is an index describing the level of similarity among stem cells and tumor cells and thus can be measured as a quantitative indication of CSCs . Logistic regression , Wilcoxon signed rank test , and Kruskal test were used to FIGURE 3 | ( A ) . Function analysis of the DEGs .

Cancer Stem Cells in HNSCC examine the relationship between clinical factors and mRNAsi . Identi ﬁ cation of DEGs The differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) among HNSCC and non - cancerous samples was determined using the “ edgeR ” R package . To correct for the limitations of statistically signi ﬁ cant gene discovery and false positives , we used the adjusted p values and the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate . | log 2 FC | > 1 and p values < 0 . 05 were used as having statistical signi ﬁ cance . The combat function of the “ sva ” R package was used to remove the batch effects . WGCNA and Module Preservation WGCNA describes the connection among genes across the whole microarray sample , as well as the correlation between highly related genes or clusters of modules and outer conditions or sample traits , which make known the successive nature of the underlying co - expressed data and is set by cutoff parameters against data loss ( Altermann and Klaenhammer , 2005 ) . RNA sequence information was ﬁ ltered to reduce outliers . Next , a weighted adjacency matrix was constructed and then transformed the adjacency matrix into a topological overlap matrix ( TOM ) , which can assess the immediate connection of gene pairs and the intensity of a relationship with other genes in the dataset . The appropriate minimum gene module size for the gene tree was set to integrate close genes into a single module . Furthermore , a modular eigengene ( ME ) , which can be representative of a modular gene expression pro ﬁ le , is determined as the ﬁ rst major component of the module of interest . In order to de ﬁ ne the importance of each module , gene signi ﬁ cance ( GS ) was used to measure the relationship among genes and sample traits . We chose mRNAsi and epigenetically regulated mRNAsi as clinical phenotypes . Typically , a marker gene is a highly connected central node that is at the heart of the network architecture . For every single gene , a module membership ( MM ) is de ﬁ ned by relating a given gene expression pro ﬁ le with the ME of a speci ﬁ c module . The cutoff for selecting hub genes in the module is characterized as cor . gene MM > 0 . 8 and cor . gene GS > 0 . 5 . Enrichment Analyses The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) ( Ashburner et al . , 2000 ) is a tool for exploring high - expression gene functions and linking genomic data from extensive molecular datasets . Gene ontology ( GO ) ( Szklarczyk et al . , 2015 ) function analysis ( biological processes ( BP ) , cellular components ( CC ) , and molecular functions ( MF ) ) is a strong bioinformatics way to determine biological process and annotate genes . To explore the function of the determined DEGs , enrichment analyses were carried out based on the GO and KEGG pathway analysis by R language ggplot2 package to visualization ﬁ gures . Protein - Protein Interaction Network Construction STRING online database was used to predict the potential PPI network information ( Gao et al . , 2013 ) . Analysis of the connection and function among DEG can give information on the mechanism of disease occurrence and development ( PPI score > 0 . 4 ) . The number of adjacent nodes of individual gene was counted , and the genes were sorted on the basis of the number of adjacent nodes .

Cancer Stem Cells in HNSCC Co - Expression Genes Analysis of Stemness - Related DEGs cBioPortal ( Visvader and Lindeman , 2008 ) is a free public asset that analyzes large - scale cancer genomics datasets . We applied c - BioPortal to explore changes in stem - associated DEG in TCGA - HNSCC samples and to provide a general view of the genetic changes for single test of stem - related DEG . The tab bio - interaction network of stem - associated DEGs and their co - expressed genes was examined and included adjacent genes with altered frequencies . Stemness Prognosis Related Genes in HNSCC Kaplan - Meier plotter was applied to predict the prognostic signi ﬁ cance of identi ﬁ ed stemness - related genes from the key modules . We next explored the expression of stemness prognosis related genes across different cancer types based on the TIMER database and The Human Protein Atlas database ( HPA ) database . TargetScan predicts biological targets of miRNAs . Based on microRNA target prediction , free online tools from Diana - miRPath were used to assess interactions among miRNA previously determined using prediction tools and stemness prognosis related genes . We ﬁ nally identi ﬁ ed stemness - related lncRNA according to a correlation coef ﬁ cient | R 2 | > 0 . 3 and p < 0 . 001 . RESULTS mRNAsi and Clinical Characteristics in HNSCC We ﬁ rst downloaded the mRNAsi data from the statistics obtained by Pan et al and contrasted the transcriptional degrees of mRNAsi in tumors and control samples ; we found signi ﬁ cantly higher mRNAsi FIGURE 6 | Immunohistochemistry results from the HPA database to illustrate that CALU , BGN , and SPON2 were signi ﬁ cantly increased in tumor tissues .

Cancer Stem Cells in HNSCC levels in HNSCC tissues ( p = 0 . 002 ) . We then explored the relationship of clinical elements and mRNAsi expressions and our results demonstrated that mRNAsi linked to the patient M - classi ﬁ cation ( p = 0 . 023 ) Figure 1A . The outcomes indicated that the expression of mRNAsi had signi ﬁ cant difference and may play a vital part in regulating HNSCC . As normal mRNAsi is remarkably dissimilar from the tumor , we carried out data cleansing to ﬁ nd differential genes . Data normalization , ﬁ ltering , and difference analysis were carried out to contrast HNSCC and normal samples . Thus , 4 , 732 DEGs were identi ﬁ ed , of which 1 , 160 were downregulated and 3 , 572 were upregulated Supplementary Table S1 . In addition , the heatmap of the top 20 upregulated as well as downregulated differentially expressed of DEGs was shown in Figure 1B . WGCNA Construction and Module Analysis Using cluster analysis , the DEGs with a maximum variance of one quarter were placed in one module , and we obtained 16 modules for the consequence analysis Figure 2A . The turquoise module was most correlated with mRNAsi , and the correlation coef ﬁ cient was close to 0 . 7 . In addition , the brown module shows a relatively high negative correlation with mRNAsi ( cor = - 0 . 8 , Figure 2B ) . A scatter plot of module eigengenes in the blue , brown , pink , and turquoise modules is shown in Figure 2C . Thus , we select the brown module as the most interesting module and used it for the following analysis ( Bai et al . , 2020 ) . We screened 20 key genes : PDGFRB , PLPP4 , CALU , ADAMTS14 , COL5A3 , KCNE4 , LOXL1 , CLEC11A , PODN , BGN , AEBP1 , COL1A2 , LAMA4 , LOXL2 , LRRC15 , THY1 , SPON2 , COL1A1 , NID2 , and AC134312 . 5 . Functional Enrichment Analysis of Key Genes We ﬁ rst analyzed the expression of these 20 key genes in cancers and normal samples and we found all key genes had signi ﬁ cantly higher expressions in HNSCC Figure 1C ; the heatmap of these 20 key genes is demonstrated in Figure 1D . We next analyzed the co - expression of these 20 key genes and we found the correlation with the lowest FIGURE 7 | The relationship between the CALU , BGN , POND , SPON2 , and lncRNAs . Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 814777 8 Wu et al . Cancer Stem Cells in HNSCC connection was between NID2 and CLEC11A ( 0 . 3 ) , while that with the highestinteractionwasamong COL1A1 and COL1A2 ( 0 . 99 ) Figure3A . We next constructed the PPI network and the count of adjacent nodes of single gene showed by histogram Figure 3B . Based on the histogram map , we found the most adjacent nodes gene was COL1A1 and COL1A2 , which indicated that these two genes may be key genes in the network . As to determine the neighbor genes ’ biological interaction network of these 20 stemness - related genes in HNSCC , tab Network in cBioPortal and the 50 most as often altered neighbor genes were displayed and the top 10 frequent alterations were PIK3CA , FGF3 , FGF19 , FGF4 , DVL3 , P3H2 , GNB4 , COL22A1 , COL14A1 , and PLOD2 ( Figure 4B and Table 1 ) . Meanwhile , these 20 key genes were modi ﬁ ed in 239 of 504 ( 47 % ) HNSCC patients and ampli ﬁ cation is the most usual modi ﬁ cation type in HNSCC ( Figure 4A ) . The Functional Annotation of Brown Modules To illuminate the functional similarity of the module genes , gene enrichment was performed based on the “ clusterPro ﬁ ler ” R software package . GO analysis results indicated that changes in BP of 20 stemness - related genes were remarkably enriched in protein heterotrimerization , protein oxidation , collagen metabolic process , response to hyperoxia , cell - substrate adhesion , and response to increased oxygen levels . Changes in MF were mainly enriched in collagen binding , growth factor binding , extracellular matrix binding , and copper ion binding . Changes in CC of DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix , ﬁ brillar collagen trimer , and apical plasma membrane Figure 3C . KEGG pathway analysis shows that the DEGs were mainly enriched in protein digestion , focal adhesion , ECM - receptor interaction and absorption , amoebiasis , Human papillomavirus infection , PI13 - Akt signaling pathway , platelet activation , and proteoglycans in cancer Figure 3D . In addition , the DEGs were mainly enriched in ECM proteoglycans and the function of collagen based on the REACTOME pathway analysis Table 2 . Analysis Stemness Prognosis Related Genes in HNSCC We identi ﬁ ed four stemness - related genes , CALU , PODN , BGN , and SPON2 , relatedto overallsurvival in HNSCC from the brown module based on Kaplan - Meier plotter database Table 3 . In order to further analyze the expression of these four genes , TIMER database was used to study the differential expression among tumor and adjacent normal tissues across all TCGA tumors Figure 5 . Immunohistochemistry results from the HPA database was used to illustrate that CALU , BGN , and SPON2 were signi ﬁ cantly increased in tumor tissues ( POND was missed ) Figure 6 . Prediction analysis using TargetScan tools determined the top 5 chosen miRNAs targeting each gene and these data help us understand how predicted miRNAs are linked to stemness - related HNSCC progress Table 4 . There were 45 stemness - related lncRNAs determined according to the screening criteria . The lncRNA LIPE - AS1 had the largest correlation coef ﬁ cient , and the target gene was SPON2 ( cor = 0 . 709 ; p = 1 . 57E - 75 ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . Meanwhile , the relationship between the four genes and lncRNAs were shown in Figure 7 . Studies reported that tumor mutation burden ( TMB ) and microsatellite instability ( MSI ) plays an important role in tumor prognosis . Thus , we ﬁ nally explored the connection among the 4 genes and TMB and MSI . The results shown that the TMB and MSI were signi ﬁ cantly related to the stemness genes and need more in - depth research Figure 8 . DISCUSSION In this study , based on the statistical data from Pan et al . , we conducted a thorough and full assessment of the prime genes FIGURE 8 | The connection among the CALU , BGN , POND , SPON2 , TMB , and MSI . Frontiers in Genetics | www . frontiersin . org May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 814777 9 Wu et al . Cancer Stem Cells in HNSCC associated with stemness by combing WGCNA with HNSCC mRNAsi based on the mRNAsi score , and explored their relationship with clinicopathological characteristics , function , and immune in ﬁ ltration . CSCs have been suggested to participate in tumor progression , therapeutic resistance , and recurrence ( Bai et al . , 2020 ) . So , therapeutic targeting of HNSCC stem cells is necessary . CSCs having a self - renewal ability as well as capacity to differentiate into various cell lineages contribute to progression , cancer initiation , and dissemination to distant organs ( Tirino et al . , 2013 ) . CSC has an endogenous resistance mechanism to radiation and chemotherapy , whichgivesCSC a survivaladvantage over differentiatedcounterparts ( Bao et al . , 2006 ; Jeon et al . , 2011 ) . Clinically , typical therapies including surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy have been successfully applied to get rid of most cancer cells . But , as for the lack of useful targeted therapy against HNSCC - CSC , intrinsically resistant CSC regions cannot be retained , resulting in regeneration of cancer cells after treatment . Thus , the discovery of the potential novel stemness related genes is important . The acquisition of progenitor cell - like and stem - cell - like features and the loss of differentiated phenotypes are indicative of cancer progression , and the high level of HNSCC remains constant as the tumor progresses . Our results show that mRNAsi is signi ﬁ cantly associated with the M classi ﬁ cation of patients , suggesting that stem cell characteristics begin to derive from the initiation of metastasis . The key genes were identi ﬁ ed from the brown module derived from GS and MM ; from the co - expression of this module we found the relationship with the lowest correlation was among NID2 and CLEC11A ( 0 . 3 ) , while that with the highest correlation was among COL1A1 and COL1A2 ( 0 . 99 ) . Meanwhile , from the histogram map , we found the largest adjacent nodes gene was COL1A1 and COL1A2 , which indicated that these two genes may be the hub genes in the network . Collagen type I alpha 1 ( COL1A1 ) belong to group I collagen which involves COL1A1 / COL1A2 ( Chan et al . , 2008 ) . Studies have reported that COL1A1 not only has high expression in gastric cancer but also plays key roles in cancer cell invasion and metastasis ( Sun , 2016 ) . A recent study found that COL1A1 activation could suppress the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . Ma et al ( Ma et al . , 2019 ) reported that COL1A1 shows survival bene ﬁ t and increases oncogenicity on hepatocellular carcinoma cells . In addition , COL1A1 and COL1A2 might forecast bad clinical results in gastric and colon cancer patient ( Li et al . , 2016 ; Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . Misawa et al ( Misawa et al . , 2011 ) found that CpG hypermethylation is a probable method of COL1A2 gene inactivation , supporting the presumption that the COL1A2 gene may play an indispensable role in the tumorigenesis of HNSCC . So , we recommended that COL1A1 and COL1A2 may serve as a possible prognostic biomarker for HNSCC prognosis and therapeutic targets , but more research is needed for further investigation . To decide the neighbor genes ’ biological interaction network of these 20 stemness - related genes in HNSCC , we identi ﬁ ed the top 10 frequent alterations were PIK3CA , FGF3 , FGF19 , FGF4 , DVL3 , P3H2 , GNB4 , COL22A1 , COL14A1 and PLOD2 . Phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3 K ) and serine / threonine kinase AKT pathway regulate cellular functions such as proliferation , cell survival , and differentiation ( Engelman et al . , 2006 ) . PIK3CA mutation status was signi ﬁ cantly related to median tumor size and signi ﬁ cantly correlated to decreased disease - free survival and overall survival in cervical cancer ( Chung et al . , 2017 ) . Kidacki et al ( Kidacki et al . , 2017 ) reported that PIK3CA mutations facilitate MMP1 - driven invasion , which supplied a potential novel target for poor metastasis in HNSCC . A recent study found that the merge of a PI3K / mTOR inhibitor and palbociclib completely controlled tumor growth in mice ( Zainal et al . , 2019 ) . We hypothesize that PIK3CA may contribute to the incidence of HNSCC and needs more related research . HPV - related HNSCC has increased over the past 2 decades and now makes up most HNSCC cases ( Koneva et al . , 2018 ) . Functions and pathways of 20 stemness - related genes were signi ﬁ cantly enriched in Human papillomavirus infection , PI13 - Akt signaling pathway . So , the stemness - related genes in the brown module may related to HNSCC - HPV via PI13 - Akt signaling pathway and AGE - RAGE signaling pathway . Our study may contribute to future research into the mechanism of cancer incidence in HNSCC . We also explored the TMB and MSI correlation with stemness - related genes in HNSCC . Liao et al ( Liao et al . , 2013 ) reported that CSC populations were less sensitive to MHC class I - restricted alloantigen - speci ﬁ c CD8 ( + ) . CTL lysis as contrasted to matched monolayer - derived cells needs more exploration . In total , 20 key genes were found to play key roles in HNSCC stem cell maintenance . CONCLUSION Our study showed the dominant role of stemness - related genes in HNSCC . However , more related studies are needed to support these results and push forward the application of these key genes ’ prognosis evaluation .
