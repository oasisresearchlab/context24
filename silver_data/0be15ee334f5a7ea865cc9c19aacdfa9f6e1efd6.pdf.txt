Galletta , Dennis Y . Chuang , John A . Cooper * Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , Washington University School of Medicine , St . Louis , Missouri , United States of America The Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for actin assembly and motility in many cell processes , and a large number of proteins have been found to bind and regulate it in vitro . A critical challenge is to understand the actions of these proteins in cells , especially in settings where multiple regulators are present . In a systematic study of the sequential multicomponent actin assembly processes that accompany endocytosis in yeast , we examined and compared the roles of WASp , two type - I myosins , and two other Arp2 / 3 activators , along with that of coronin , which is a proposed inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 . Quantitative analysis of high - speed fluorescence imaging revealed individual functions for the regulators , manifested in part by novel phenotypes . We conclude that Arp2 / 3 regulators have distinct and overlapping roles in the processes of actin assembly that drive endocytosis in yeast . The formation of the endocytic actin patch , the creation of the endocytic vesicle , and the movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm display distinct dependencies on different Arp2 / 3 regulators . Knowledge of these roles provides insight into the in vivo relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for actin assembly .

PLoS Biol 6 ( 1 ) : e1 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 0060001 Introduction Dynamic networks of branched actin ﬁlaments are fre - quently found adjacent to membranes and appear to play a role in many cellular process ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) . The dendritic nucleation model provides a framework to understand how networks of branched actin ﬁlaments assemble and generate a pushing force [ 2 – 4 ] . A key step in the formation of a branched actin ﬁlament network is the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , which nucleates a new actin ﬁlament from the side of an existing ﬁlament . This new growing ﬁlament pushes against the membrane . Arp2 / 3 normally exists in an inactive state and requires an activator protein to induce a large conformational change , which allows for nucleation of a new actin ﬁlament ( reviewed in [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] ) . Coronin , an Arp2 / 3 inhibitor , stabilizes Arp2 / 3 in the inactive conformation [ 7 ] . In some cases , targeting the Arp2 / 3 complex to a subcellular location—rather than activating it—may be the principal role for an Arp2 / 3 - binding protein ( reviewed in [ 3 , 8 – 10 ] ) . Of note , with yeast actin as a substrate , the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex nucleated polymerization rather well in the absence of an activator [ 8 , 11 ] . Activators enhanced the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex in these studies , but by a relatively small amount . Thus , yeast Arp2 / 3 activators may be critical for spatial control of actin assembly by targeting , rather than activating , Arp2 / 3 . An important challenge for the ﬁeld is to understand how the activities of multiple Arp2 / 3 - activating proteins are coordinated in vivo . Do these activators have overlapping functions or does each of these proteins have a unique role in the formation of a proper network ? We addressed this question by investigating the roles of all of the proposed Arp2 / 3 regulatory proteins in the assembly and movement of cortical actin patches in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Actin patches contain ﬁve proteins with an acidic / DDW motif for binding the Arp2 / 3 complex : a WASp ( Las17 ) ; two type - I myosins ( Myo3 and Myo5 ) ; an Eps15 homology ( EH ) protein ( Pan1 ) ; and an actin ﬁlament – binding protein ( Abp1 ) ( Figure 1A ) [ 12 ] . The acidic / DDW region is necessary and sufﬁcient to bind the Arp2 / 3 complex , and all of these proteins can bind and activate Arp2 / 3 in vitro [ 13 – 20 ] . Actin patches also contain a coronin , Crn1 , which can inhibit Arp2 / 3 activation in vitro [ 21 , 22 ] . The actin patch provides an excellent system to test the roles of these regulators in a single , complex , multicomponent system . In yeast , actin patch assembly and movement mediates endocytosis [ 23 – 27 ] . Actin patches assemble at the plasma membrane as the endocytic vesicle forms . Patches then move into the cell with the vesicle [ 24 , 28 , 29 ] . Patch formation and movement occurs rapidly , on a time scale of seconds to minutes , and depends on Arp2 / 3 complex and actin polymer - ization [ 29 – 32 ] . The life cycle of an actin patch is a stereotyped sequence of events that is characterized by changes in protein composi - tion , location , and movement ; this can be seen as three phases ( Figure 1B ) . In phase I , actin patches assemble at the cortex and display a limited amount of motion , as if tethered in place . Many proteins are recruited to the actin patch during this phase , including WASp / Las17 and endocytic adaptors Sla1 , Sla2 , and Pan1 . Near the end of phase I , the actin ﬁlament network begins to assemble , as indicated by the arrival of the Arp2 / 3 complex , capping protein ( Cap1 / Cap2 ; CP ) , and the actin ﬁlament – binding proteins ﬁmbrin / Sac6 and Abp1 [ 24 , 33 ] . Phase II is characterized by slow movement of the patch a short distance into the cell , away from the Academic Editor : Mark W .

Some patch components appear to remain at the membrane during this movement , such as Las17 and Myo5 [ 24 , 34 ] , whereas others appear to move into the cell , including Sla1 , Sla2 , Pan1 , Arp2 / 3 , CP , and Abp1 . At the end of phase II , several proteins are lost from the patch , including Sla1 , Sla2 , and Pan1 . During phase III , patches contain actin ﬁlaments and actin - binding proteins , and they undergo more rapid and lengthy movement into the cell before disappearing [ 24 , 33 ] . In this study , we used high - speed video microscopy , coupled with computer - assisted patch tracking and quanti - tative motion analysis , to study the effect of mutations in genes for Arp2 / 3 regulators on the assembly and movement of actin patches marked by green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - labeled components . The methodology allowed the study of large numbers of patches , which revealed novel phenotypes in the mutants . These studies provide new evidence about the function of each of the Arp2 / 3 regulatory proteins and reveal that these regulators have some roles that are distinct from each other , as well as some that are overlapping . Results The Acidic / DDW Domain of WASp / Las17 Is Important for Actin Patch Motility Las17 , the yeast WASp protein , binds to and activates Arp2 / 3 via an acidic / DDW region at its C terminus ( Figure 1A ) [ 11 , 19 ] . To determine the role that this region plays in actin patch motility , a C - terminal truncation that removed the acidic / DDW region was generated . All of the mutations described in this study were made at the endogenous locus and were examined in haploids , where the mutant allele was the only allele of the gene present . The mutation removed the Arp2 / 3 - binding region but not other known domains , including the WH2 domain that binds actin monomer . The truncated Las17 localized to actin patches by GFP tagging ( data not shown ) . We tracked the positions of hundreds of patches over time and then used several forms of quantitative motion analysis to assess the effect of mutations . The methodology is described fully in Materials and Methods . Mean squared displacement ( MSD ) plots were one form of analysis , and examples of how such plots were generated and used to monitor each phase of the patch life cycle are presented in Figure 1C – 1E . We ﬁrst examined the effects of this mutation on phase I and II of patch motility using Sla2 - GFP labeling ( Video S1 ) . MSD plots , generated from displacement data of individual patches aligned at the start of their lifetimes and then averaged , indicated a defect in the behavior of las17 D acidic patches during phase I or II . In contrast , MSD plots of the same data , averaged after aligning individual patch curves at the end of their lifetimes , showed no defect in the mutant ( Figure 2A ) . To examine phases I and II more closely , we quantitated directly the frequency and timing of early events . The amount of time that patches spent at their origin , before moving off the membrane , was greatly increased in las17 D acidic mutant cells ( Figure 2C ) , which can account for the observed defect in MSD plots aligned at the start ( Figure 2A ) . The percentage of patches that left the membrane , corresponding to transition from phase I to phase II , was essentially normal ( Figure 2B ) . To determine if the timing of the recruitment of actin was normal in las17 D acidic cells , we determined the time between the appearance of Sla2 and of Abp1 , a marker of actin ﬁlaments . The arrival of actin ﬁlaments to the patch was delayed in las17 D acidic cells ( Figure S1 ) . To examine patch movement during phase II , we isolated tracking data for patches—after they moved off the membrane—with Sla2 - GFP labeling . In this analysis , the las17 D acidic cells were normal ( Figure 2D ) . Taken together , the data support a model where the acidic domain of Las17 is critical for the duration of phase I but not for the ability of the patch to leave the membrane or for its initial movement off the membrane . The effect of the las17 D acidic mutation on the movement of actin patches during phase III was examined using Abp1 - GFP ( Video S2 ) . Patch movement was decreased in the mutant and was assessed with MSD plots aligned at the start or the end of patch lifetime ( Figure 2E ) . Decreased movement at the start of Abp1 - GFP patch life can result from a prolongation of phase I , as seen with Sla2 - GFP . Indeed , as expected , the time that Abp1 - GFP patches remained at their origin was prolonged ( Figure 2G ) , and the percentage of patches that moved away from their origin was slightly reduced in las17 D acidic cells ( Figure 2F ) . MSD plots aligned at the end of patch lifetimes showed a decrease in movement , as noted above ( Figure 2E , right ) . We tested the phase III movement directly by isolating tracking data for patches after they moved 200 nm from their membrane origin . Patches of las17 D acidic cells showed decreased movement in MSD plots aligned at the beginning and end of this movement ( Figure 2H ) . In previous studies in yeast , GFP - labeled WASp proteins remained on the membrane , exhibiting phase I behavior , and did not move off the membrane [ 24 , 33 , 35 ] These results raised the question of how the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin assembly might power the movement of endocytic vesicles into and about the cytoplasm . We found similar results with PLoS Biology | www . plosbiology . org January 2008 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e1 0073 Arp2 / 3 Regulators Author Summary A branched network of growing actin filaments , pushing against a membrane , provides the force for certain cellular movements . The Arp2 / 3 complex plays a central role in this process by generating new filaments and branch points . A number of proteins bind to and , in some cases , regulate Arp2 / 3 . It is important to determine , in the cell , the precise roles of each of the many Arp2 / 3 regulators in generating actin networks during a complex , multistep , cellular movement . In yeast , endocytosis occurs at the plasma membrane in association with the assembly and movement of cortical actin patches , which contain six Arp2 / 3 regulators . We have used the actin patch as a model system to determine the specific roles of these regulators during patch assembly and movement . We used high - speed video microscopy , coupled with computer - aided particle tracking , to monitor the movement of fluorescently labeled actin patches in cells with one or more mutations of the Arp2 / 3 regulators . The sensitivity of this technique allowed us to identify previously unappreciated functions for Arp2 / 3 regulators and to assign each of the regulators a specific role during actin patch assembly and movement . Our results demonstrate that Arp2 / 3 regulatory proteins play overlapping roles at certain stages of actin patch movement , but distinct roles at other stages . In addition , our results provide new insight into how the assembly of an actin filament networks powers the movement of endocytic vesicles away from the membrane . GFP fused to the C terminus of Las17 . However , we ﬁnd that neither C - nor N - terminal fusions of GFP to Las17 , which were expressed from the endogenous las17 locus , are fully functional for actin patch motility , especially for the late movements of phase III ( Figures S2 and S3 ) . Interestingly , when we overexpressed a novel N - terminal fusion from the GAL1 promoter , approximately one - third of GFP - Las17 – labeled patches exhibited substantial movement away from their origin . They moved into and about the cytoplasm , as seen in confocal movies taken at the equator of the cell ( Figure 2I – 2J , Videos S3 – S4 ) . Although this method is technically challenging , we have observed examples of colocalization of these particles moving into the cytoplasm with Abp1 - tdimer2 ( Video S5 ) . However , this GFP fusion protein may also not reveal the normal localization of the Las17 protein . Actin patch motility in strains expressing this fusion was impaired , especially during phase III ( Figure S4 ) , indicating that Las17 function was not normal in these strains . In addition , cells expressing GFP - Las17 from the GAL1 promoter have a distinct population of GFP - Las17 particles moving freely inside the cell ( Figure 2K , Video S6 ) . These particles have a markedly greater lifetime than do actin patches , so the particles may correspond to membranous vesicles moving in the cytoplasm reported in previous studies [ 33 , 36 , 37 ] . Type - I Myosins Have Distinct but Overlapping Functions The C termini of fungal type - I myosins , including Myo3 and Myo5 of budding yeast , have an acidic / DDW sequence that binds Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 1A ) [ 14 , 17 , 38 , 39 ] . These type - I myosins are capable of activating Arp2 / 3 in vitro when they are artiﬁcially connected to a WH2 domain or in the presence of the WH2 - containing protein , Vrp1 , the yeast WASp - interacting protein ( WIP ) [ 13 , 15 ] . To determine the role of type - I myosins in actin patch motility , we examined the effect of the deletion of the myo3 and myo5 genes on Abp1 - GFP dynamics . myo3 D cells were normal , by MSD analysis ( Figure 3E ) , with no defects in the percentage of patches leaving the origin or the time that patches spent at the origin ( Figure 3F – 3G ) . In contrast , myo5 D cells had substantial defects in Abp1 - GFP motility ( Figure 3E ) . The median lifetime of Abp1 - GFP patches in the absence of Myo5 was found to be increased , and the distance of the movement of Abp1 - GFP patches was decreased , in MSD plots with patch tracks aligned at the beginning and at the end of their lifetimes . The time that Abp1 - GFP patches spent at the origin was increased in myo5 D cells , and the percentage that moved away from the origin was decreased ( Figure 3F – 3G ) . The effect of the loss of Myo5 on the early phases of actin patch motility was also examined using Sla2 - GFP labeling . MSD plots of Sla2 - GFP movement , aligned at the beginning and at the end of patch lifetimes , revealed decreased movement with an increase in median lifetime ( Figure 3A ) . ? > Figure 1 .

To determine if the phase II movement of patches in myo5 D cells was normal when they did leave the membrane , we isolated and analyzed movement of Sla2 - GFP – labeled patches from the membrane . Phase II patch movement was found to be decreased in the myo5 D cells by MSD analysis ( Figure 3D ) . Observations of cell growth and endocytosis have indicated that Myo3 and Myo5 have overlapping functions , with apparent redundancy in some cases [ 40 , 41 ] . To address this question , we examined Abp1 - GFP patch behavior in myo3 D myo5 D double mutants . MSD curves showed a severe defect in patch motility , with a nearly complete loss of movement away from the origin and an increase in median patch lifetime , when compared to wild - type or single - mutant cells ( Figure 3E ) . The percentage of Abp1 - GFP patches leaving the membrane was very small , and the lifetime of patches at the origin was greatly increased ( Figure 3F – 3G ) . The number of patches leaving the membrane was not sufﬁcient to permit a direct analysis of phase III movement . Taken together , these results show that although the function of Myo5 is distinct from that of Myo3 , the proteins do have some functions in common . The results are consistent with the previous observation of endocytosis defects in myo5 D but not myo3 D single mutants , and with multiple observations that myo5 D myo3 D double mutants are more severely affected in growth and endocytosis than either single mutant alone [ 40 , 41 ] . Arp2 / 3 - Binding Regions of Type - I Myosin and WASp To determine if the actin patch phenotypes of the type - I myosin null mutants , myo3 D and myo5 D , result from loss of Arp2 / 3 interaction , we truncated the acidic / DDW region of each type - I myosin . For Myo5 , loss of the acidic / DDW region had no effect on phase I and II movement except for a small , statistically signiﬁcant increase in movement in MSD plots of Sla2 - GFP patch tracks aligned at the end of their lifetime ( Figure 3H – 3J ) . For phase III movement , which was assessed with Abp1 - GFP , MSD curves showed a slight leftward shift when tracks were aligned at the start , but no change when aligned at the end ( Figure 3K ) . Abp1 - GFP patches remained at the origin for slightly less time in the mutant cells ( Figure 3M ; p ¼ 0 . 0003 ) , but the frequency with which patches moved away from the origin was normal ( Figure 3L ) . These results were a surprising contrast to those for the myo5 D null mutant , which had a strong defect in phase III and signiﬁcant ones in phases I and II . For Myo3 , a similar truncation of the acidic / DDW region had no effect on phase I or II of actin patch movement , which were examined with Sla2 - GFP ( Figure 3H – 3J ) , or on phase III , which was examined using Abp1 - GFP ( Figure 3K – 3M ) . These results were largely similar those for the myo3 D null mutant and thus not surprising . To determine if the absence of a phenotype in the single - mutant strains was a result of functional redundancy , we examined cells carrying both truncation mutations . Patch movement was again remarkably unaffected . The double mutant produced results very similar to those for the Myo5 single mutant for all three phases of patch life ( Figure 3H – 3J ) . During phase III , actin patches of double - mutant cells were slightly different from those of the Myo5 single mutant ( Figure 3K – 3M ) , but this difference barely achieved statistical signiﬁcance . Overall , the Arp2 / 3 - binding regions of Myo3 and Myo5 were dispensable for function in this otherwise wild - type genetic background , in striking contrast to the effect of the complete loss of one or both proteins . Several lines of evidence suggest that the type - I myosins might function as a complex with WASp / Las17 and WIP / Vrp1 , with overlapping function among the three Arp2 / 3 - binding regions [ 14 , 17 , 42 ] . To test this possibility , we examined actin patch motility in haploid strains carrying a las17 D acidic mutation in combina - tion with myo3 D acidic and / or myo5 D acidic mutations . First , we examined phases I and II with Sla2 - GFP labeling . Patch movement in las17 D acidic myo3 D acidic cells was similar to that in las17 D acidic cells during phases I and II ( Figure 3N ) . Only small differences of marginal statistical signiﬁcance were observed for the time that patches remained at the origin and for the frequency with which patches left the membrane ( Figure 3P and 3O ) . In contrast , cells lacking the acidic / DDW regions of WASp / Las17 and Myo5 showed substantially greater defects than cells lacking only the acidic / DDW region of WASp / Las17 . Patch movement in the double mutant was decreased , by MSD analysis , compared with that in the single mutant ( Figure 3N ) . This defect resulted in large part from a decrease in the frequency with which patches left the origin to begin phase II movement ( Figure 3O ) . In addition , patches in las17 D acidic myo5 D acidic cells spent more time at their point of origin before disappearing or moving away than did those of las17 D acidic cells ( Figure 3P ) . In triple - mutant cells , which lack the acidic domains of WASp / Las17 , Myo3 , and Myo5 , Sla2 - GFP patch motility was decreased compared with double mutants ( Figure 3N ) . The frequency with which triple - mutant patches left the origin was only slightly lower ( Figure 3O ) , and the time that patches remained at the origin was similar ( Figure 3P ) when compared with las17 D acidic myo5 D acidic cells . Phase III patch movement was examined in these mutants using Abp1 - GFP . The loss of the acidic domain of Myo3 had little effect on the motility of Abp1 - GFP patches in las17 D acidic cells by MSD analysis ( Figure 3Q ) . The frequency with which patches moved away from the origin and the time patches spent at the membrane were very similar ( Figure 3R and 3S ) , similar to the results with Sla2 - GFP labeling . If anything , loss of the acidic domain of Myo3 suppressed the phenotype of increased time that Abp1 - GFP patches spent at the membrane in las17 D acidic cells ( Figure 3S , p ¼ 0 . 0007 ) . In contrast , las17 D acidic myo5 D acidic double - mutant cells had greater defects in Abp1 - GFP patch motility than did las17 D aci - dic cells ( Figure 3Q ) . The percentage of patches that moved away from their origin was decreased ( Figure 3R ; p ¼ 0 . 04 ) , and the time that patches spent at the membrane prior to moving away was increased ( Figure 3S ; p ¼ 0 . 0004 ) . Patches in las17 D acidic myo5 D acidic cells still retained a measurable level 83 , and 73 . ( D ) Strains as in ( A – C ) .

Indeed , Abp1 - GFP patch motility was decreased in las17 D acidic myo3 D acidic myo5 D acidic triple - mutant cells compared to las17 D acidic myo5 D acidic cells , with a nearly complete loss of motility ( Figure 3Q ) . The percentage of patches that moved away from the origin was less , and the time that patches remained at the origin was greater ( Figure 3R – 3S ) . Together , the results indicate that the Arp2 / 3 - binding regions of WASp and the type - I myosins do have a signiﬁcant level of functional redundancy , consistent with the notion that they may act in a complex in which any and all of the three Arp2 / 3 complex interactions can be important . In previous studies suggesting the existence of such a complex , WIP , known as verprolin / Vrp1 in yeast , was also found in biochemical association . We found that a WIP null mutant , vrp1 D , had essentially no patch movement , with Sla2 - GFP or Abp1 - GFP labeling ( unpublished data ) , in agreement with another study [ 15 ] . Actin patches did still form in all of these mutants , including the WIP null mutant and the WASp / type - I myosin triple mutant , showing that actin ﬁlaments can still polymerize but not with the dynamic control needed to achieve movement . A Role for Pan1 in the Early Phases of Patch Assembly The endocytic adaptor protein Pan1 has an acidic / DDW region for binding the Arp2 / 3 complex , along with two EH domains , a coiled - coil region , and a WH2 domain [ 43 ] . Pan1 is essential for viability in yeast , and because the loss of endocytosis does not appear to be lethal , this suggests that Pan1 may have other functions . To investigate the possible importance of Pan1 9 s interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex in actin patch dynamics , the acidic / DDW region of the Pan1 protein was removed ( Figure 1A ) . The PAN1 gene was mutated at its endogenous locus in a diploid strain and tetrad dissection produced haploid mutant segregants that grew well ( Protocol S1 ) . In haploid mutant pan1 D acidic cells labeled with Sla2 - GFP , the time that patches remained at their origin was slightly increased ( Figure 4C ) , and MSD plots of tracks aligned at the start of their lifetimes showed decreased movement ( Figure 4A ) . The percentage of patches leaving the origin was normal ( Figure 4B ) , as was MSD analysis with curves aligned at the end of their lifetimes ( Figure 4A ) . Examining only the data for movement away from the membrane in phase II , we found that patch movement was also normal in the mutant ( unpublished data ) . Thus , only the earliest stages of patch dynamics were affected by removing the Arp2 / 3 binding region of Pan1 . WASp / Las17 was also important in the early stages of the actin patch life cycle , as described above , so we combined the pan1 D acidic and las17 D acidic mutations . Double - mutant hap - loid cells had a more severe defect than did either single mutant , in terms of the time that patches spent at their origin ( Figure 4C ) and MSD analysis with curves aligned at the start ( Figure 4A , left ) . The percentage of patches leaving the origin was decreased slightly ( Figure 4B ) , and MSD analysis with curves aligned at the right was normal , similar to the single mutants ( Figure 4A , right ) . This enhanced phenotype in the double mutant is consistent with synthetic interactions between pan1 and las17 mutations in terms of cell growth [ 42 ] . With Abp1 - GFP labeling to examine phase III behavior , pan1 D acidic single - mutant cells displayed a defect in MSD plots aligned at the left , no defect in MSD plots aligned at the right ( Figure 4D ) , a decrease in the percentage of patches that moved away from the origin ( Figure 4E ) , and a slight increase in the time that patches remained at the origin before moving away or disappearing ( Figure 4F ; p ¼ 0 . 0005 ) . These results are consistent with the phase I and II results for this mutant , based on the Sla2 - GFP labeling result above , and they indicate that phase III patch behavior was normal in the pan1 D acidic single mutant . For double - mutant las17 D acidic pan1 D acidic cells labeled with Abp1 - GFP , the early phases of actin patch dynamics were similar to those of las17 D acidic cells , based on the early time points in MSD plots aligned at the left . The time that patches spent at the membrane and in the percentage of patches that moved away from the origin was also similar ( Figure 4E and 4F ) . However , double - mutant cells showed an increase in phase III movement , compared to las17 D acidic cells , at later time points in MSD plots , aligned at the start or end of patch life ( Figure 4D ) . This rescue is the result of a combination of an increase in the percentage of patches making movements beyond 200 nm and an increase Figure 3 .

Thus , in this respect , the pan1 D acidic mutation suppressed the phenotype of the las17 D acidic mutation , suggesting that Pan1 and Las17 have opposing actions on Arp2 / 3 complex in this later phase of patch lifetime . Abp1 Has a Role in the Early Phases of Patch Dynamics Abp1 is present at the patch just before movement of the patch away from the membrane to the end of its life . Abp1 has two acidic / DDW regions that bind the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 1A ) and an ADFH domain that binds F - actin [ 44 ] . In early studies , abp1 D null mutants were nearly normal in many respects , but the abp1 D mutation has been found to have genetic interactions with sla1 D , sla2 , and las17 D mutations [ 45 ] . Actin patches of abp1 D mutants , labeled with Sla1 - GFP , showed an increase in the distance that Sla1 - GFP moved from the membrane and an increase in Sla1 and Sac6 lifetimes [ 23 ] . We found that Sla2 - GFP patches of abp1 D cells remained longer at their origin ( Figure 5C ; p ¼ 0 . 0002 ) , and the percentage of patches that left their origin was normal ( Figure 5B ) . By isolating the data for patch movement away from the membrane in phase II , we found that initial movement of patches away from the membrane was normal ( Figure 5D , left ) and that , remarkably , the ﬁnal extent of movement was greatly increased ( Figure 5D , right ) . Consistent with these observations , MSD analysis of the complete tracks showed an increase in the median lifetime of the patches and greater movement away from the origin ( Figure 5A ) . One explanation for the increase in median lifetime and move - ment is that Sla2 - GFP remains on the patch for a longer time in the absence of Abp1 . Phase III of actin patch movement in abp1 D cells was examined using Cap1 - GFP as a marker ; the behavior of Cap1 - GFP patches essentially mirrors that of Abp1 - GFP patches in wild - type cells [ 23 , 33 ] . The time that patches spent at their origin was increased ( Figure 5G ) , and the percentage of patches moving away from the membrane was normal ( Figure 5F , p ¼ 0 . 08 ) , as seen with Sla2 - GFP labeling above . MSD plots of the complete lifetime were decreased in abp1 D cells , for curves aligned at the start of their lifetime , but not at the end ( Figure 5E ) . We isolated the data for patch movement beyond 200 nm , and the results for abp1 D cells were identical to those for wild - type cells ( Figure 5H ) . The Cap1 - GFP results indicate a delay in the initiation of patch movement with normal movement after leaving the membrane for the abp1 D mutant . Considering all the data , for Sla2 - GFP and Cap1 - GFP labeled patches , Abp1 appears to be important to promote patch assembly before leaving the membrane , but not for patch movement after leaving the membrane . In addition , Abp1 appears to play a role in the removal of Sla1 and Sla2 from the patch after the initial movement into the cytoplasm . Coronin as an Inhibitor of Actin Assembly Coronin / Crn1 has been shown in vitro to inhibit the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex for nucleation of actin polymerization [ 21 ] . To determine if coronin has such a role in actin patch dynamics , we examined crn1 D null mutant cells . Phases I and II of patch motility , examined with Sla2 - GFP , were nearly normal in most respects , with only a slight decrease in the MSD plot , a slight increase in median lifetime ( Figure 6A , left ) , and a slight increase in time at the origin ( Figure 6C ; p ¼ 0 . 001 ) . With Abp1 - GFP labeling of patches , the time spent at the origin was increased but not the probability of leaving the origin ( Figure 6F and 6G ) , similar to the results with Sla2 - GFP . Together , these results suggest a minor delay in the transition from phase I to II when coronin is absent , suggesting that coronin promotes the ability of patches to move off the membrane . Phase III dynamics in crn1 D mutant cells , examined using Abp1 - GFP , showed a rightward shift in the MSD plot with Figure 4 .

The plot extended to greater distances and longer times , suggest - ing that patches moved farther and longer in the absence of coronin . In support of this idea , when the curves were aligned at the end of patch lifetime , the MSD plot showed increased movement of crn1 D patches ( Figure 6E , right ) . Isolating the data for movement of Abp1 - GFP patches in phase III , crn1 D patches showed more movement by MSD analysis , with curves aligned at the start or end of their lifetime ( Figure 6H ) . Thus , coronin appears to inhibit the movement of patches after they move away from the membrane and into the cytoplasm . Discussion Cells have a number of proteins with the biochemical ability to regulate the Arp2 / 3 complex . Whether these proteins have such roles in cells and , if so , how those roles are manifested and coordinated are important questions in understanding the cell biology of actin assembly and motility . Our results demonstrate that the collection of Arp2 / 3 regulatory proteins in yeast have largely distinct functions in generating actin assembly to create force and movement during endocytosis . In some situations , individual functions can overlap , increasing the robustness of the system . Figure 7 summarizes the results , illustrating the roles of speciﬁc regulators in the stereotyped series of processes that compose the assembly and movement of cortical actin patches as part of endocytosis . Assembly of the Actin Patch Early in the life of an actin patch , a series of proteins are recruited to a location on the plasma membrane , assembling the machinery required for endocytosis [ 24 ] . During this time , the actin patch appears to be tethered or corralled , under - going random movements conﬁned to a small area [ 24 , 33 ] . Assembly of a dendritic network of actin ﬁlaments proceeds [ 24 , 33 ] , which appears to be needed for the movement of the actin patch and endocytic vesicle away from the membrane . Our results show that , on some level , essentially all of the Arp2 / 3 regulatory proteins play a role in these initial phases of the process . Mutations in these proteins alter the amount of time that patches persist at the site of their appearance , undergoing tethered movement , which is termed phase I . For the WASp Las17 and the EH domain protein Pan1 , mutations Figure 5 .

Mutations in the Arp2 / 3 - binding motif of Las17 delays the appearance of Abp1 - GFP at patches , suggesting that although the other Arp2 / 3 activators can eventually assemble an actin ﬁlament network , they do so less efﬁciently without Las17 . Combinations of Arp2 / 3 - binding mutations reveal the potential for overlapping function among the regulators . For example , combining the las17 D acidic mutation with the pan1 D acidic , the myo5 D acidic , or the myo5 D acidic myo3 D acidic mutations further prolonged the time for patch assembly in phase I . Arp2 / 3 regulators are likely required at this stage to ensue the proper targeting and activity level of the Arp2 / 3 complex to generate a functional actin network for move - ment . In their absence , the network may not have the proper branch density and ﬁlament length required to initiate invagination and / or movement . Patch Movement away from the Plasma Membrane : WASp and Type - I Myosin The ﬁrst nonrandom movement of an actin patch is a short one away from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm , which has been hypothesized to represent membrane invagination to form an endocytic cup [ 24 ] . Complete deletions of the type - I myosin genes had the greatest effect on this movement . Loss of Myo5 decreased the probability that a patch would undergo phase II movement , and it lessened the extent of movement per se . Loss of both Myo3 and Myo5 resulted in almost no movement away from the cortex , supporting a model that type - I myosins are needed to power this movement prior to vesicle scission [ 15 ] . Given the severity of the phenotypes in the type - I myosin null mutants , we were surprised to ﬁnd that truncation of the type - I myosin Arp2 / 3 - binding regions had little or no effect . Myo3 and Myo5 have been suggested to function in coordination with or in parallel with WASp / Las17 , perhaps as a multisubunit complex [ 14 , 17 , 42 ] . When we combined Arp2 / 3 - binding mutations of WASp / Las17 with those of type - I myosins , the phenotype was enhanced , consistent with that view . In las17 D acidic myo5 D acidic and las17 D acidic myo3 D acidic myo5 D acidic cells , actin patches failed to move away from the origin . Verprolin / Vrp1 , the yeast homologue of WIP was suggested to function as a scaffold or central component of such a multisubunit complex [ 14 ] . In support of that view , loss of Vrp1 caused a complete loss of actin patch movement [ 15 ] . Figure 6 .

Many Arp2 / 3 regulators are dispensable for phase II movement . Deletion of the acidic domain of Las17 or Pan1 , independently or together , had no effect . The loss of neither coronin nor Abp1 affected this movement . Loss of Abp1 did result in Sla2 - GFP – labeled patches moving farther away from the cortex than normal , which supports the view that Abp1 may help to remove early components such as Sla1 and Sla2 from the patch [ 23 ] . Phase II may not depend on precise regulation of Arp2 / 3 localization or activation , because no single Arp2 / 3 binding mutant had a detrimental effect on this movement . However , previous studies of the capping protein suggest that the regulation of the number of free barbed ends is critical for normal movement during phase II . Furthermore , in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 - binding regions of Las17 / WASp and the type - I myosins , phase II movement fails to occur . This failure in phase II may reﬂect a requirement for Arp2 / 3 activation during phase II movement itself or it may also reﬂect a failure to establish a proper network during the phase I . In addition , the motor activities of the type - I myosins appear to play some role in the in initial movement of patches away from the membrane [ 15 ] . Patch Movement in the Cytoplasm After the actin patch departs the plasma membrane , it moves faster and farther , through the cytoplasm . When the Arp2 / 3 - binding region of WASp / Las17 was truncated , actin patches had a severe defect in phase III movement , which is important in light of the relative normalcy of phase II movement for this mutant . The simplest interpretation of these results is that WASp / Las17 remains bound to the endocytic vesicle as it moves through the cytoplasm , analogous to the situation for the movement of pathogens in cells or beads in cell extracts . GFP - WASp fusions at the N and C termini were not seen to leave the membrane in this manner in previous studies in budding and ﬁssion yeast , including some in our lab [ 24 , 33 , 35 ] . We observed that tagging WASP / Las17 at either end with GFP results in defects in actin patch motility reminiscent of those seen in las17 D acidic strains ( Figures S2 – S4 ) . We also observed that overexpressed Las17 , tagged at the N terminus , did leave the membrane and move about the cytoplasm , in the manner of actin patches and endocytic vesicles ( Figure 2I – 2J ) . To be fair , the ﬂuorescence of these foci of GFP - Las17 was weak , and Abp1 - tdimer2 patch movement in these cells was defective . Therefore , it remains a possibility that Las17 may not normally leave the membrane with patches . Our results with coronin address this question of how the patch moves through the cytoplasm . The coronin null mutant showed increased patch movement during phase III , which is consistent with the prediction from biochemical studies that coronin inhibits the activity of Arp2 / 3 complex . Yeast Arp2 / 3 complex is highly active in the absence of any activator when actin from yeast is used [ 11 ] , so an inhibitor , namely coronin , may be quite important in this system . The loss of the capping Figure 7 . A Model for Endocytosis and Actin Patch Assembly , with a Summary of the Requirements for Individual Arp2 / 3 Regulatory Proteins During phase I , almost all of the Arp2 / 3 regulators have a role in promoting assembly . At this stage , Arp2 / 3 regulators presumably act to establish a proper actin network with appropriate filament lengths and branch density . During phase II , Arp2 / 3 regulation is complex . Mutation of no single Arp2 / 3 regulator affected this stage , but simultaneous mutation of the Arp2 / 3 binding regions of WASp / Las17 , Myo3 , and Myo5 did disrupt this movement . Capping protein also has a role at this stage [ 33 ] . During phase III , several lines of evidence support a model where actin filaments , nucleated at the actin patch , drive movement of the vesicle through the cytoplasm . In this model , barbed ends are oriented toward the vesicle ( see Discussion ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 0060001 . g007 PLoS Biology | www . plosbiology . org January 2008 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e1 0082 Arp2 / 3 Regulators protein resulted in a speciﬁc defect of phase III movement [ 33 ] , which is also consistent with the model . Together , these results with WASp / Las17 , coronin , and capping protein provide evidence that Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly powers the movements of phase III , which supports the relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for this process . Several key components of the dendritic nucleation model are known to be present on patches during phase III movement , including actin , the Arp2 / 3 complex , capping protein , and now WASp / Las17 [ 23 , 24 , 30 , 33 ] . The location of actin ﬁlament nucleation and the orienta - tion of the actin ﬁlaments during actin patch assembly and movement is an important question . When endocytosis is blocked in sla2 D cells , actin ‘‘ comet tails ’’ appear at the plasma membrane , with growing barbed ends oriented toward the membrane [ 24 ] . However , it is unclear where actin ﬁlaments are nucleated when endocytosis is proceeding normally , especially during invagination and during move - ment after the patch leaves the plasma membrane . No actin connection between the plasma membrane and a phase II or III patch can be seen . If ﬁlaments growing at the plasma membrane were responsible for this movement , the newest parts of the network would be at the membrane , and would likely be relatively bright when monitored by ﬂuorescent fusion proteins . This is not the case . Previous results show that actin cables do not drive patch movement in the cytoplasm [ 33 ] . We therefore favor a model where actin ﬁlaments are being nucleated at the surface of the endocytic vesicle , during and after invagination . We observed some longer - lived GFP - Las17 – labeled par - ticles moving in the interior of the cell without ﬁrst seeing them leave the plasma membrane . For actin patches , this type of observation was very rare . Whether these GFP - Las17 particles represent a later stage of actin patches , endocytic vesicles , or another cellular compartment remains to be determined . The character of the movement of these particles is reminiscent of what has been seen by studying the membrane receptor Ste2 or the lipid dye FM4 – 64 , which follow endocytic trafﬁcking pathways [ 33 , 36 ] . In previous studies , the movement of Ste2 - GFP particles was impaired when WASp / Las17 was truncated or when Lsb6 , a Las17 - binding protein , was absent [ 36 , 37 ] , which also supports the hypothesis that Las17 is needed to drive Ste2 vesicles . Materials and Methods Yeast strains . The strains used in this study are listed in Table S1 and their construction is described in Protocol S1 . Microscopy . For each genotype , two or three mutant and wild - type haploid segregants from a heterozygous diploid were tested . For each segregant , movies were collected from eight different cells . Strains were grown overnight in YPD at 25 8 C or 30 8 C to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 82 g , suspended in SD - complete media , placed on 2 % agarose pads made with SD - complete , and covered with a number 1 coverslip as described [ 33 ] . GFP ﬂuorescence movies were made using a spinning - disc confocal microscope system consisting of an upright microscope ( BX52 , Olympus ) with a PlanApo100X 1 . 4 NA oil immersion objective , a CSU10 Yokogawa spinning disc head ( Solomere Technology ) , and an intensiﬁed charge coupled device ( CCD ) video camera ( XR Mega10 S30 camera , Stanford Photonics ) . Two color images were collected sequentially using a LMM5 Laser Merge Module ( Spectral Applied Research ) , a multipass dichroic mirror , and emission ﬁlters in a Lambda 10 – 3 high - speed ﬁlter wheel ( Sutter Instruments ) . The temperature was maintained at 30 8 C . Large budded cells were selected for observation . Images were collected from a single focal plane at the equator of the cell . Abp1 - GFP , Abp1 - tdimer2 , Sla2 - GFP , and GFP - Las17 movies were collected at frame rates of 5 / s , 5 / s , 2 / s , and 2 / s , respectively . For quantitative motion analysis , 200 consecutive frames were collected . Images were collected using QED In Vivo software ( Media Cybernetics ) , except for the experiments in Figure 4D – 4F and Figure 2I – 2K , which were collected using Piper Imaging . Computer - assisted patch tracking and quantitative motion analy - sis . GFP - labeled actin patches in movies were tracked using previously described software [ 31 ] . The experimenter veriﬁed every patch track using an ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) plug - in that overlaid the position information from the tracking software onto the original movie , and necessary corrections were made by hand . The data were then imported into an Excel spreadsheet ( Microsoft ) . Tracks were retained for analysis if they met the following criteria : ( 1 ) The patch was observed for at least 30 frames ( 6 s for Abp1 - GFP and 15 s for Sla2 - GFP ) . ( 2 ) The patch originated near the cortex . ( 3 ) The patch disappeared during the movie . ( 4 ) The patch was readily distinguished from other patches . These criteria enrich our sample for patches whose entire lifetime is captured in the movie . Zero time for a track was deﬁned as the time at which the patch was ﬁrst observed , and the end point was deﬁned as the last time point at which the patch was observed . The character and extent of the motion of GFP - labeled patches was analyzed ﬁrst with plots of MSD versus time . To calculate MSD , the square of the distance of each patch from its origin was calculated at each time point . The squared displacement values were averaged for all the patches from all the cells of each segregant of a particular genotype . The degree of variation among individual tracks was high , as seen in previous studies , so we averaged the data for 150 to 542 patches for each genotype . To test for statistical signiﬁcance , MSD curves from each segregant of one genotype were ﬁrst compared by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to ensure that they yielded the same result . A grand MSD versus time plot was then generated , averaging the data for all of the patches from all of the segregants of a given genotype within one experiment . Before averaging , the squared displacement values for each patch were aligned at the beginning or end of the track lifetime . Examples of how a set of data was aligned in the two ways before averaging are shown in Figure 1C . Plots aligned ‘‘ at the start ’’ or ‘‘ on the left ’’ provide information about the behavior of patches in the early part of their life . These curves are truncated at the time when 50 % of the patches have disappeared , representing the median lifetime . Plots aligned ‘‘ at the end ’’ or ‘‘ on the right ’’ allow for a better understanding of the motion of GFP - labeled actin patches later in their lifetime , away from the origin . Comparisons between genotypes were evaluated using Student’s t - test . The patch tracking data were analyzed in additional ways . For individual patch track data of X - Y position and time , we determined if a patch left its origin and how long it remained at its origin before it moved away or disappeared . To analyze ‘‘ phase II only ’’ data after initiation of movement , the data for Sla2 - GFP patches after they moved away from the origin were selected . MSD versus time plots were generated with these data . To analyze ‘‘ phase III only , ’’ we selected the data for Abp1 - GFP labeled patches after they moved more than 200 nm away from the origin .
