Front . Cell . Neurosci . 12 : 189 . doi : 10 . 3389 / fncel . 2018 . 00189 In humans , Down Syndrome ( DS ) is a condition caused by partial or full trisomy of chromosome 21 . Genes present in the DS critical region can result in excess gene dosage , which at least partially can account for DS phenotype . Although regulator of calcineurin 1 ( RCAN1 ) belongs to this region and its ectopic overexpression in neurons impairs transmitter release , synaptic plasticity , learning and memory , the relative contribution of RCAN1 in a context of DS has yet to be clariﬁed . In the present work , we utilized an in vitro model of DS , the CTb neuronal cell line derived from the brain cortex of a trisomy 16 ( Ts16 ) fetal mouse , which reportedly exhibits acetylcholine release impairments compared to CNh cells ( a neuronal cell line established from a normal littermate ) . We analyzed single exocytotic events by using total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter fused to the pH - sensitive green ﬂuorescent protein ( VAChT - pHluorin ) as a reporter . Our analyses showed that , compared with control CNh cells , the trisomic CTb cells overexpress RCAN1 , and they display a reduced number of Ca 2 + - induced exocytotic events . Remarkably , RCAN1 knockdown increases the extent of exocytosis at levels comparable to those of CNh cells . These results support a critical contribution of RCAN1 to the exocytosis process in the trisomic condition .

RCAN1 in Exocytosis in Trisomy 16 ( Lanfranchi et al . , 2004 , 2010 ; Roberts et al . , 2007 ) . These cognitive deficits appear to correlate with altered brain development and morphology , particularly in the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex regions ( Menghini et al . , 2011 ; Carducci et al . , 2013 ) . However , neurochemical dysfunctions also seem to underlie the condition . Indeed , reduced levels of some neurotransmitters , such as glutamate , GABA , dopamine and serotonin have been found in brains of DS individuals ( Godridge et al . , 1987 ; Reynolds and Warner , 1988 ; Risser et al . , 1997 ) . These alterations in neurotransmission could in turn impair synaptic plasticity ( Siarey et al . , 1997 , 1999 , 2005 ; Kleschevnikov et al . , 2004 ; Belichenko et al . , 2007 ) , and consequently hinder learning and memory ( Morice et al . , 2008 ) . Among the many genes overexpressed in the DS condition is Down SD critical region 1 ( DSCR1 ) , also known as Regulator of Calcineurin 1 ( from RCAN1 ) . This gene is located in the DS critical region ( Fuentes et al . , 1995 ) and encodes a protein that inhibits the Ca 2 + - dependent phosphatase calcineurin ( Fuentes et al . , 2000 ; Rothermel et al . , 2000 ) . The Rcan1 protein is highly expressed in human fetal brains ( Fuentes et al . , 1997 ) , and its mRNA levels are reportedly 2 – 3 - fold higher in post - mortem brains from Alzheimer’s disease patients and DS patients suffering from Alzheimer’s symptoms ( Ermak et al . , 2001 ) . Mice models overexpressing Rcan1 exhibit impairments in long - term synaptic potentiation , learning and memory ( Dierssen et al . , 2011 ; Xing et al . , 2013 ; Wong et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , Rcan1 overexpression in adrenal chromaffin cells disturbs transmitter release ( Keating et al . , 2008 ; Zanin et al . , 2013 ) . Hence , the overexpression of this protein could greatly contribute to the reduced neurotransmitter levels observed in the DS condition . However , the contribution of Rcan1 in a context where other genes of the DS critical region are also overexpressed has yet to be determined , which is most relevant to the trisomic condition . The CTb cell line , derived from the brain cortex of trisomy 16 ( Ts16 ) mice , an animal model of DS , overexpresses most of the genes of the DS critical region ( Reeves et al . , 1986 ) , including Rcan1 ( Lange et al . , 2004 ) . Similar to primary culture of central neurons from Ts16 mouse fetus , CTb cells display altered Ca 2 + currents and cytosolic Ca 2 + signals ( Cárdenas et al . , 1999 ; Rojas et al . , 2008 ; Acuña et al . , 2012 ) . Cholinergic function is also impaired , which is characterized by a reduced fractional acetylcholine release ( Fiedler et al . , 1994 ; Allen et al . , 2000 ) . This latter condition could be the consequence of an altered exocytosis mechanism . To study this possibility , and the role of Rcan1 in this dysfunction , we monitored exocytosis in CTb cells expressing the vesicular acetylcholine transporter fused to the pH - sensitive green fluorescent protein ( VAChT - pHluorin ) by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) . We also evaluated the expression of Rcan1 in CTb cells and reduced its levels to those of the CNh cell line ( ‘‘ knockdown ’’ ) via transfection with specific siRNAs . We found that CTb cells overexpress Rcan1 and exhibit a reduced number of Ca 2 + - induced exocytosis events , compared to CNh cells , a cell line established from a normal littermate . Rcan1 knockdown in the trisomic CTb cells restored the extent of exocytosis to levels comparable to those of the control cell line . This study is an important step in the quest for understanding the mechanisms contributing to neurotransmission dysfunction in the DS condition .

The siRNA - 2 against mouse RCAN1 ( ID : MSS285509 , Catalog # 1320001 ) was purchased from Thermo Fisher ( Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Culture of Cell Lines and Transfection The establishment and characterization of both the CNh and CTb cell lines have been previously reported ( Cárdenas et al . , 1999 ) . Both cell lines were cultured in a 1 : 1 mixture of DMEM / F12 supplemented with 10 % of fetal bovine serum , 50 U / ml penicillin and 100 µ g / ml gentamicin at a density of 3 × 10 5 cells / ml in 25 mm glass coverslips and incubated at 37 ◦ C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere until experimentation . For cell transfections , 2 µ g of VAChT - pHluorin or 1 µ g of control non - targeting ( NT ) siRNA or siRNA against Rcan1 were incorporated into the cells using 8 µ L of Lipofectamine 2000 in 42 µ L of DMEM / F12 media without fetal bovine serum or antibiotics . This mixture was incubated for 15 min , and later mixed with 50 µ L of DMEM / F12 for 4 . 5 h at 37 ◦ C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere .

RCAN1 in Exocytosis in Trisomy 16 protein content was determined using the Quant - it Protein Assay Kit ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Total proteins ( 100 µ g ) were separated by SDS - PAGE on 10 % polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) . Blots were preincubated with phosphate - buffered saline containing 5 % bovine serum albumin and 1 % Tween - 20 for 2 h at room temperature . Then , the membranes were cut at approximately 40 kDa , so that Rcan1 and β - tubulin ( loading control ) could be probed in parallel . Afterwards , membranes were incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C with polyclonal antibodies against Rcan1 ( 1 : 500 ) or β - tubulin ( 1 : 1000 ) . After primary antibody incubation and washing , incubation with a secondary donkey anti - rabbit HRP antibody ( 1 : 5000 ) or with an anti - sheep HRP antibody ( 1 : 5000 ) was performed for 1 h and detection was carried out using ECL Select Western Blotting Detection Reagent ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences Corp . , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) . Immunoreactive bands were detected using the image acquisition system Epichemi 3 Darkroom . The image analysis software ImageJ 1 . 43 m ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) was used for quantification . Live - Cell Fluorescence Imaging Cells were imaged using an inverted microscope ( Eclipse Ti - E , Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) implemented with a 60 × / 1 . 49NA Plan APO TIRF objective ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) and a Perfect Focus Unit TI - ND6 - PFS ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Samples were illuminated by 488 nm laser ( 488 - 20LS , OBIS , Coherent , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Images were acquired by using a Digital Camera C11440 ( ORCA - FLASH 2 . 0 ; Hamamatsu Photonics , Hamamatsu City , Japan ) and the NIS - Element viewer 4 . 3 software ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Images were acquired at 300 ms intervals in stream mode . During recordings , cells were perfused with a Krebs - Hepes solution ( mM : 140 NaCl , 5 . 9 KCl , 1 . 2 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 D - glucose , 10 Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 4 ) and exocytosis was induced with 100 µ M nicotine or 20 µ M ionomycin in the perfusion solution . The extracellular Ca 2 + concentration in the experiments with ionomycin was 4 mM . To quench extracellular VAChT - pHluorin , an acid solution containing ( in mM ) : NaCl ( 140 ) , KCl ( 2 . 4 ) , CaCl 2 ( 2 ) , MgCl 2 ( 2 ) , glucose ( 10 ) , HEPES ( 10 ) , citric acid ( 10 ) , adjusted to pH 7 . 2 , 6 . 0 or 5 . 5 was used . For experiments with 100 mM HEPES , the concentration of NaCl was adjusted to keep osmolarity constant . Each recording lasted 3 min . All the experiments were performed at room temperature ( 20 ± 2 ◦ C ) . Image sequences were analyzed with the ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) implemented with a macro to automatize spot analysis . Briefly , exocytosis events were manually pointed out in the videos , and two circular regions of interest ( ROI ) , each one greater than 2 - pixel diameter ( 1 pixel = 240 nm ) , were drawn around the selected event . One of the ROI corresponded to an exocytotic event and the other to background . Only abrupt increases in fluorescence intensity that did not shift in X , Y planes or overlap with other fluorescence events were analyzed . Fluorescence intensity of each selected ROI was measured and background was subtracted to obtain the fluorescence profile . A secondary bright spot next to the fusion event was used as intrinsic reference . The decay phase was plotted and fitted to a single exponential decay function using the software Origin 8 . 0 ( OriginLab , Northampton , MA , USA ) . Data Analysis For each condition , we analyzed 9 – 30 independent cells from at least three different cultures . Statistical significance was determined utilizing analyses of variance ( ANOVA ) , followed by Tukey - Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test as post hoc . Given that time constants ( τ ) were non - parametrically distributed , data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal - Wallis test , followed by Dunn’s Multiple Comparisons test as post hoc .

RESULTS Characterization of Exocytosis in CNh and CTb Cells To characterize the frequency of exocytosis and kinetics of events in CNh and CTb cells , we used the VAChT - pHluorin chimera as a reporter . In this construct , pHluorin is fused to the putative first intraluminal loop of VAChT which is targeted to the acidic lumen of cholinergic vesicles . In vesicles , pHluorin is quenched and its fluorescence drastically increased when it is exposed to neutral extracellular medium upon exocytosis ( Brauchi et al . , 2008 ) . In order to ascertain whether overexpressed VAChT is correctly targeted to cholinergic vesicles , we immuno - stained cells for the endogenous VAChT and evaluated colocalization by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient ( PCC ) . We found that VAChT - pHluorin significantly colocalized with VAChT in both CNh and CTb cells with PCC values of 0 . 8 ± 0 . 05 in CNh cells and 0 . 9 ± 0 . 03 in CTb cells ( see Supplementary Figure S1 ) . To monitor exocytosis and gain insight into the kinetics of single exocytotic events , we imaged cells using TIRFM . We first analyzed CNh and CTb cells maintained in resting conditions . Figure 1A shows representative TIRF images of CNh and CTb cells expressing VAChT - pHluorin . Vesicle - like structures were detected as fluorescent spots distributed along the cell body . As observed in neurons with the use of other pHluorin constructs ( Atluri and Ryan , 2006 ) , we identified different pools of fluorescent spots in CNh or CTb cells : ( 1 ) Figure 1B shows a pool of immobile fluorescent spots that exhibited constant fluorescent intensity ( see spots ( a ) in Figure 1B ) . These were quenched after cell incubation with an acid solution ( Figure 1C ) suggesting that they Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 3 July 2018 | Volume 12 | Article 189 Vásquez - Navarrete et al . RCAN1 in Exocytosis in Trisomy 16 FIGURE 1 | Different types of VAChT - pHluorin ﬂuorescent spots in CNh and CTb cells . Cells cultured in 25 mm coverslips were transfected with the VAChT - pHluorin expression vector using lipofectamine 2000 . Cells were visualized by TIRF microscopy 24 h later . ( A ) Expression and distribution of VAChT - pHluorin in CNh and CTb cells . Scale bar = 10 µ m . ( B ) The kymograph shows three different types of ﬂuorescent spots : ( a ) immobile spots showing constant ﬂuorescent intensity ; ( b ) a ﬂuorescent spot moving along x , y positions , and ( c ) a spot that abruptly appeared and displayed a fast and transient increase in ﬂuorescence intensity . ( C ) CNh cells were incubated in an acid solution containing ( in mM ) : NaCl ( 140 ) , KCl ( 2 . 4 ) , CaCl 2 ( 2 ) , MgCl 2 ( 2 ) , glucose ( 10 ) , HEPES ( 10 ) , citric acid ( 10 ) , adjusted to pH 7 . 4 , 7 . 2 , 6 . 0 or 5 . 5 and total ﬂuorescence intensity was measured . Data are means ± SEM of the total cell ﬂuorescence in arbitrary units at each pH ( n = 7 ) . Insets : examples of images acquired at each pH . Scale bar = 10 µ m . corresponded to surface expression of VAChT - pHluorin . This has been previously observed with other pHluorin constructs in hippocampal neurons ( Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2000 ; Gandhi and Stevens , 2003 ; Fernández - Alfonso et al . , 2006 ) . ( 2 ) A small fraction of immobile fluorescent spots ( app . 4 % ) that showed constant fluorescent intensity and it could not be quenched by an acid solution ( Figure 1C ) . ( 3 ) Few spots that moved along x , y positions ( see spot ( b ) in Figure 1B ) . Pools ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) might correspond to internalized vesicles that have not yet been reacidified , as observed in hippocampal neurons ( Atluri and Ryan , 2006 ) . ( 4 ) A fraction of spots appeared abruptly , displaying a fast and transient increase in fluorescence intensity ( see spot ( c ) in Figure 1B ) ; these latter types are reminiscent of exocytotic events ( Gandhi and Stevens , 2003 ) and were further considered for analysis . Spontaneous Exocytosis Is Not Altered in CTb Cells To characterize exocytotic patterns and to determine whether exocytotic parameters were modified between CNh and CTb cells , a ROI around the exocytotic spot was delineated and changes in fluorescence intensities were measured inside and outside the ROI ( see Figure 2A ) . With this strategy , we identified two types of VAChT - pHluorin fluorescence behavior in both CNh and CTb cells . The first was classified as non - lateral diffusion events , since VAChT - pHluorin fluorescence increased and vanished without diffusing outside the ROI ( see upper panels in Figure 2A ) . The second , instead , showed a fast increase in VAChT - pHluorin fluorescence , which spread outside the ROI ( see lower panels in Figure 2A ) . These latter events were termed lateral diffusion events . According to this classification , 82 ± 5 % of events in CNh cells ( n = 30 ) and 90 ± 3 % of events in CTb cells ( n = 29 ) displayed non - lateral diffusion at resting conditions , whereas less than 20 % of the total events in both types of cells diffused laterally . During the 3 min recording period , exocytosis events with non - lateral diffusion amounted to 5 . 2 ± 0 . 8 in resting CNh cells ( n = 30 ) and 6 . 2 ± 0 . 9 in CTb cells ( n = 29 ; Table 1 ) , whereas the events with lateral diffusion amounted to 0 . 9 ± 0 . 2 ( n = 30 ) and 0 . 9 ± 0 . 3 ( n = 29 ) , in resting CNh and CTb cells , respectively ( Table 1 ) . No significant difference was found in the number of exocytotic events of CNh and CTb cells . Ca 2 + - Induced Exocytosis Is Reduced in CTb Cells The release of neurotransmitters relies mostly on Ca 2 + - regulated exocytosis . Therefore , we induced exocytosis with nicotine , an agonist that reportedly evoked intracellular Ca 2 + increases and 3 H - choline release in CNh and CTb cells ( Cárdenas et al . , 1999 , 2017 ; Allen et al . , 2000 ; Opazo et al . , 2006 ; Rojas et al . , 2008 ) . In CNh cells , nicotine induced 28 ± 4 . 1 events with non - lateral diffusion and 3 ± 0 . 5 events with lateral diffusion ( n = 15 ) , being both significantly larger than those observed in resting conditions ( Figures 2B , C ) . In CTb cells , nicotine did not increase the amount of non - lateral diffusion events , as compared with the resting condition ( Figure 2B ) , although this was the predominant mode of exocytosis ( 76 ± 2 % of the events ) . The number of nicotine - induced events with non - lateral diffusion in CTb cells was 8 . 1 ± 0 . 6 , whereas for lateral diffusion the value was 2 . 6 ± 0 . 3 . Considering that the Ca 2 + response induced by cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors agonists is altered in the trisomic CTb cells ( Cárdenas et al . , 1999 , 2017 ; Rojas et al . , 2008 ) , and that nicotine did not increase the amount of exocytosis in CTb cells , we decided to induce exocytosis using the Ca + 2 ionophore ionomycin . Upon stimulation with this compound , both CNh and CTb cells showed a significant increase in both types of exocytotic events ( lateral and non - lateral diffusion ; Figures 2D , E ) with non - lateral diffusion events being predominant ( 93 ± 2 and 83 ± 3 % in CNh and CTb cells , respectively ) .

Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of cells analyzed from at least three independent cultures . ∗ p < 0 . 05 ( ANOVA followed by Tukey - Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test ) . with non - lateral diffusion was significantly reduced in CTb cells compared to CNh cells ( p < 0 . 05 ) , with 31 ± 3 . 7 ( n = 14 ) events for CNh cells and 15 ± 1 . 9 ( n = 14 ) events for CTb cells ( Figure 2D ) . Under ionomycin stimulation , exocytotic events showing lateral diffusion accounted for only 2 . 1 ± 0 . 5 ( n = 14 ) and 2 . 8 ± 0 . 5 ( n = 14 ) in ionomycin - stimulated CNh and CTb cells , respectively , and were not significantly different between both cell types ( Figure 2E ) . This suggests that only the frequency of exocytosis with no lateral diffusion is altered in CTb cells ( Figure 2C ) . Decay Time Constants of pHluorin Fluorescence Signals Do Not Differ Signiﬁcantly in Normal and Trisomic Cells Due to its exquisite sensitivity to pH , pHluorin is a powerful tool to study vesicular trafficking and pH variations . When fused to a membrane protein and targeted to the lumen of acidic organelles , increase in fluorescence intensity is related to pHluorin unquenching due to increase in pH .

Then , analysis of decay time constant in pHluorin fluorescence signals would give us information about the mechanisms of vesicle retrieval or endocytosis . Examples of temporal fluorescence intensity profiles of non - lateral diffusion events in CNh or CTb cells are shown in Figure 3A . In resting or stimulated CNh or CTb cells , decay time constants of these pHluorin fluorescence signals fitted with a first order exponential decay ( R > 0 . 95 ) and were non - parametrically distributed ( Figures 3B – D ) . Decay time values of non - lateral diffusion events in resting CNh and CTb cells were 1 . 4 ± 0 . 2 s and 1 . 1 ± 0 . 1 s , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Given that decay times of pHluorin fluorescence signals with non - lateral diffusion became slower in the presence of a high concentration of HEPES , which slows down the reacidification of retrieved vesicles ( Vardjan et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2011 ) or bafilomycin A1 , an inhibitor of the vesicular ATPase that also prevents the vesicle reacidification ( Sankaranarayanan and Ryan , 2001 ; Roman - Vendrell et al . , 2014 ) , we evaluated the effects of these agents in our cell models . As shown in Table 1 , both 100 mM HEPES and 100 nM bafilomycin A1 slowed decay times of non - lateral diffusion events of resting CNh and CTb cells , suggesting that changes in decay times reflected , at least in part , a re - acidification of the retrieved vesicles . As compared to resting conditions , decay times significantly increased to 2 . 8 ± 0 . 1 s and 3 . 5 ± 0 . 1 in nicotine - stimulated CNh and CTb cells , respectively ( Figure 3E ; p < 0 . 05 ) . Decay times also increased in ionomycin - stimulated cells , to 2 . 4 ± 0 . 2 s and 3 . 3 ± 0 . 3 s for CNh and CTb cells , respectively ( Figure 3F ; p < 0 . 05 ) . However , decay times of CNh and CTb cells were not significantly different . Examples of temporal fluorescence intensity profiles of lateral diffusion events in CNh or CTb cells are shown in Supplementary Figure S2A . In resting or stimulated CNh or CTb cells , decay time constants of lateral diffusion events fitted with a first order exponential decay ( R > 0 . 95 ) . They were non - parametrically distributed ( Supplementary Figures S2B – D ) . For these types of events , decay times were 1 . 6 ± 0 . 2 s and 1 . 3 ± 0 . 2 s for CNh cells and CTb cells in resting conditions , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Neither HEPES nor bafilomycin A1 influences decay times of theses pHluorin fluorescence signals ( Table 1 ) . This is in agreement with previous reports , which proposed that decay time constants of lateral diffusion events depend on lateral diffusion of pHluorin after vesicle fusion ( Bowser and Khakh , 2007 ; Malarkey and Parpura , 2011 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ; Xu et al . , 2017 ) . As compared with the resting condition , decay times of lateral diffusion events significantly increased to 3 . 3 ± 0 . 1 s and 3 . 2 ± 0 . 2 in nicotine - stimulated CNh and CTb cells , respectively ( Supplementary Figure S2E ; p < 0 . 05 ) . Stimulation with ionomycin also significantly increased decay time in CNh and CTb cells ( 2 . 7 ± 0 . 4 s and 2 . 9 ± 0 . 3 s , respectively ) as compared with resting cells ( Supplementary Figure S2F ) . No significant differences were found between decay times of lateral diffusion events of CNh and CTb cells under the different stimulation conditions . Rcan1 Knockdown Restored Ca 2 + - Dependent Exocytosis in Trisomic CTb Cells To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for defects in the exocytosis of the trisomic CTb cells , we focused on Rcan1 since it is overexpressed in DS patients suffering from Alzheimer’s symptoms ( Ermak et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , its overexpression in adrenal chromaffin cells impairs exocytosis ( Keating et al . , 2008 ; Zanin et al . , 2013 ) . We first compared expression levels of Rcan1 in CTb cells with CNh cells by using Western blot assays ( Figure 4A ) . In five independent experiments , we found that expression levels of Rcan1 is 1 . 8 - fold higher in CTb cells as compared to CNh cells ( Figure 4B ) . To determine whether Rcan1 overexpression is responsible for the impaired exocytosis , we knocked down Rcan1 in CTb cells using specific siRNAs and compared Rcan1 expression levels to CTb cells transfected with the NT siRNA . The expression of Rcan1 was significantly reduced 24 h after transfection of CTb cells with two different Rcan1 siRNAs , siRNA - 1 and siRNA - 2 ( p < 0 . 05 compared with the Rcan1 expression in NT transfected CTb cells ) . Remarkably , expression levels of Rcan1 in that condition was restored to levels comparable to those of CNh cells ( Figure 4B ) .

Next , we analyzed exocytosis events in CTb cells knocked down for Rcan1 . In resting conditions , no significant alterations were observed , as the number of non - lateral diffusion events accounted for 4 . 8 ± 1 . 0 ( n = 15 ) in CTb cells transfected with NT , and 4 . 8 ± 0 . 9 ( n = 9 ) and 4 . 1 ± 1 . 0 ( n = 10 ) in cells transfected with siRNA1 and siRNA - 2 , respectively . As expected , stimulation with ionomycin increased the number of exocytosis events , but interestingly the amount of exocytosis in stimulated Rcan1 knockdown CTb cells was significantly greater than that of NT - transfected CTb cells ( 11 . 5 ± 2 . 3 events ( n = 16 ) with NT , and 27 ± 2 . 4 ( n = 13 ) and 26 ± 2 . 8 ( n = 12 ) events with Rcan1 siRNA1 and siRNA - 2 , respectively p < 0 . 05 ; Figure 5A ) . In all conditions , events with non - lateral diffusion represented over 80 % of total exocytotic events . Indeed , 81 ± 6 % and 88 ± 3 % for NT siRNA - transfected cells in resting and stimulation conditions , and 97 ± 3 % and 90 ± 2 % for Rcan1 knockdown CTb cells with siRNA - 1 in resting and stimulation conditions , and 81 ± 5 % and 89 ± 1 % for Rcan1 knockdown CTb cells with siRNA - 2 in resting and stimulation conditions , respectively . Like non - transfected cells , decay times of transfected non - lateral diffusion decayed with first - order kinetics ( R > 0 . 95 ) . Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 8 July 2018 | Volume 12 | Article 189 Vásquez - Navarrete et al . RCAN1 in Exocytosis in Trisomy 16 In resting conditions , decay time constants were 1 . 3 ± 0 . 1 s , 1 . 4 ± 0 . 2 s and 1 . 5 ± 0 . 1 s for CTb cells transfected with NT , siRNA - 1 or siRNA - 2 , respectively . As shown in Figure 5B , decay time significantly increased upon stimulation with ionomycin in CTb cells transfected with NT ( p < 0 . 05 compared with resting CTb cells in each condition ) , however it did not in cells transfected with siRNA - 1 or siRNA - 2 . Rcan1 knockdown with siRNA - 1 or siRNA - 2 did not significantly affect decay time constants as compared with NT - siRNA transfected cells . Regarding the number of events with lateral diffusion , the small amount of this type of event observed did not allow us to perform statistical analyses . Indeed , CTb cells transfected with NT or Rcan1 siRNAs exhibited less than one event in resting conditions . In ionomycin - stimulated condition , they amounted to 1 . 0 ± 0 . 3 , 2 . 8 ± 0 . 7 and 3 . 2 ± 0 . 4 events in CTb cells transfected with NT , siRNA - 1 or siRNA - 2 , respectively . DISCUSSION Cholinergic transmission plays a crucial role in memory and learning ( Thiel , 2003 ; Voss et al . , 2012 ; Handjaras et al . , 2013 ) . In Ts65Dn mice , an animal model of DS , a reduced hippocampal release of acetylcholine during memory performances correlates with poor performance in tasks designed to evaluate working memory ( Chang and Gold , 2008 ) . Diminished acetylcholine release has also been observed in primary cultures of neurons from Ts16 mice brains ( Fiedler et al . , 1994 ) , as well as in the trisomic CTb cell line ( Allen et al . , 2000 ) . In the present work , we have characterized the modes by which VAChT - pHluorin is released in the trisomic CTb cells . Our major findings indicate that i ) the amount of Ca 2 + exocytosis is reduced in CTb cells ; and ii ) reducing expression levels of Rcan1 in CTb cells at levels comparable to CNh cells restore Ca 2 + - dependent exocytosis . Do Non - lateral and Lateral Diffusion Events Reﬂect Different Modes of Exo / Endocytosis ? Using vesicle associated pHluorin as a reporter , TIRF microscopy allows single exocytosis event analysis by detecting bright flashes of fluorescence , and to extract the rate constant from fluorescence intensity variation ( Poulter et al . , 2015 ) . In CNh and CTb cells maintained in resting or stimulated conditions , over 80 % of the fluorescence flashes showed non - lateral diffusion of VAChT - pHluorin . This restricted diffusion pattern of pHluorin - tagged proteins has been attributed to the retrieval of vesicle components at fusion sites and is reminiscent of the kiss - and - run mechanism of exo / endocytosis ( Jullié et al . , 2014 ; Xu et al . , 2017 ) . This mechanism relies on the transient opening of the fusion pore , a narrow channel formed during exocytosis ( Lindau and Alvarez de Toledo , 2003 ; Mosharov and Sulzer , 2005 ) , which in turn restricts the release of transmitters ( Albillos et al . , 1997 ; Alés et al . , 1999 ; Alabi and Tsien , 2013 ) . The kiss - and - run mechanism has been described in hippocampal synapses ( Stevens and Williams , 2000 ; Gandhi and Stevens , 2003 ; Harata et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) , calyx of Held nerve terminal ( He et al . , 2006 ) and dorsal root ganglion neurons ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) . On the other hand , lateral diffusion events have been associated with full fusion exocytosis ( Taraska et al . , 2003 ; Tsuboi and Rutter , 2003 ; Jullié et al . , 2014 ) . In this mode of exocytosis , the entire vesicle membrane merges with the plasma membrane , and consequently vesicle proteins spread out by lateral diffusion through the plasma membrane ( Taraska et al . , 2003 ) . However , the non - lateral and lateral diffusion events observed in the CNh and CTb cells could not necessarily correlate with these two modes of exocytosis , since , on one hand , selected vesicle membrane proteins can be released in some forms of kiss - and - run ( Tsuboi and Rutter , 2003 ; Tsuboi et al . , 2004 ) , and , on the other hand , some vesicle membrane proteins do not spread after full fusion , and remain clustered at fusion sites until endocytosis begins ( Opazo et al . , 2010 ; Ceridono et al . , 2011 ) . However , it is important to consider that in the latter case , the recapture of the vesicle proteins takes minutes , whereas , in our case VAChT - pHluorin fluorescence decayed in seconds , and with values comparable to reported kiss - and - run events ( Tsuboi and Rutter , 2003 ; Tsuboi et al . , 2004 ; Bowser and Khakh , 2007 ) . Reduced Amount of Exocytosis in the Trisomic CTb Cells In contrast to a recent study using the Ts65Dn mouse model ( Marland et al . , 2016 ) , we found that in response to ionomycin , CTb cells showed a decrease in exocytosis frequency compared to control CNh cells ( Figure 2B ) . Several reasons may explain this discrepancy . The first one might be the difference of genetic background between the Ts16 and Ts65Dn mice used in both studies . Ts65Dn mouse carries a segmental trisomy of the chromosomes 16 and 17 ( Reeves et al . , 1995 ) , whereas chromosome 16 is completely triplicated in the Ts16 mouse ( Reeves et al . , 1987 ; Coyle et al . , 1991 ) . Nevertheless , both mouse models carry most of the gene complement of the Down syndrome critical region , including RCAN1 , APP , SOD1 and DYRK1A ( Reeves et al . , 1995 ; Gardiner et al . , 2003 ; Lange et al . , 2004 ; Duchon et al . , 2011 ) . The second explanation relies on image acquisition frequency . Indeed , whereas we acquired 1 image every 300 ms ( 3 . 3 Hz ) , Marland et al . ( 2016 ) recorded 1 image every 4 s ( 0 . 25 Hz ) . According to the mean fluorescence decay time measured in our study ( less than 4 s ) , it is likely that , at 0 . 25 Hz , some events were missed and hence did not yield a full comprehensive view of exocytotic events . Nonetheless , our results are in line with neurotransmitter release defects observed in models of DS ( Fiedler et al . , 1994 ; Chang and Gold , 2008 ) , suggesting that regulated - exocytosis is indeed altered in CTb cells . The Knockdown of Rcan1 Increases the Extent of Exocytosis in CTb Cells Among the genes amplified in DS cells , we focused our attention on Rcan1 since its overexpression impairs the extent of exocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells ( Keating et al . , 2008 ; Zanin et al . , 2013 ) . We confirmed that Rcan1 is overexpressed in CTb cells Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 9 July 2018 | Volume 12 | Article 189 Vásquez - Navarrete et al . RCAN1 in Exocytosis in Trisomy 16 compared to CNh cells ( Figure 4 ) , and to address its contribution to the regulation of exo / endocytosis , we reduced its expression by transfecting specific Rcan1 siRNAs . In this condition , RCan1 abundance reached levels comparable to those observed in CNh cells . Interestingly , although Rcan1 knockdown in CTb cells did not affect spontaneous exocytosis , it increased the number of non - lateral diffusion events induced by ionomycin , reaching values similar to those of CNh cells . Therefore , as in chromaffin cells , our study indicates that Rcan1 is involved in the control of regulated exocytosis . The effects of the Rcan1 overexpression on exocytosis in chromaffin cells seem to be a consequence of the chronic inhibition of calcineurin . Indeed , chronic exposure of chromaffin cells to calcineurin inhibitors reduced the total amount of exocytosis and impaired vesicle recycling ( Zanin et al . , 2013 ) . Among the calcineurin substrates involved in vesicle recycling are dynamin , amphiphysin and synaptojanin ( Cousin and Robinson , 2001 ) . Of particular interest is dynamin , which in addition to its role in endocytosis , regulates exocytosis and vesicle recycling ( González - Jamett et al . , 2010 , 2013 ; Moya - Díaz et al . , 2016 ) . Rcan1 also regulates , via calcineurin , the actin cytoskeleton dynamics by regulating cofilin phosphorylation ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) , a protein that disassembles actin filaments ( Maciver and Hussey , 2002 ; Pavlov et al . , 2007 ; Pfaendtner et al . , 2010 ) . It is known that Rcan1 overexpression reduces the levels of active cofilin ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) , and cofilin knockdown decreases G - actin / F - actin ratio ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ) . Since actin plays critical roles at different stages of exocytosis ( Porat - Shliom et al . , 2013 ; Olivares et al . , 2014 ) Rcan1 overexpression could have affected exocytosis in CTb cells by impairing actin remodeling . Interestingly , CTb cells exhibit increased F - actin / G - actin ratio when compared with CNh cells ( Pérez - Núñez et al . , 2016 ) and it has been observed that a reduced F - actin disassembly negatively impacts exocytosis ( Meunier and Gutiérrez , 2016 ) . CONCLUSION Hundreds of genes are overexpressed in DS ( Hattori et al . , 2000 ) , which have a variable contribution to the phenotypes associated with the trisomic condition . Although the molecular mechanisms remain to be addressed , we found that the overexpression of Rcan1 contributes to the reduced exocytosis function in the trisomic condition . Rcan1 knockdown is apparently sufficient to restore such impaired exocytosis , even when other genes of the DS critical region , such as the amyloid precursor protein and the DS cell adhesion molecule , are also overexpressed ( Opazo et al . , 2006 ; Rojas et al . , 2008 ; Pérez - Núñez et al . , 2016 ) .
