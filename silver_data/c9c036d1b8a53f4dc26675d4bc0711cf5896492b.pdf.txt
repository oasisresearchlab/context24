Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome arises from muta - tions in the Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) , a cytoplasmic protein that links signaling by cell surface receptors such as the T - cell receptor and integrins to actin polymerization . WASp pro - motes the functions of multiple cell types that support immune responses , but also is important for the function of regulatory T cells and in TCR - induced apoptosis , two negative mechanisms of immune regulation that maintain peripheral immune tolerance . Here we review the nature of immune defects and autoimmunity in WAS and WASp deﬁcient mice and discuss how this single gene defect can simultaneously impair immune responses to pathogens and promote autoimmu - nity . The myriad cellular immune defects found in WAS make this Mendelian syndrome an interest - ing model for the study of more complex immune diseases that arise from the interplay of environmental and multiple genetic risk factors .

The Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome ( WAS ) is a X - linked primary immunodeﬁciency disorder occurring with a frequency of between 1 and 10 per million males . WAS results from mutations in the gene coding for the Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) , a key regulator of branched actin chain polymerization [ 1 ] . However , the clinical manifestations of WAS are not limited to immunodeﬁ - ciency , thrombocytopenia and eczema , the classically deﬁned trio of symptoms in this syndrome . A remarkably high percentage of WAS patients also develop autoimmunity . The protean clinical manifestations of this single - gene disease likely arise from the numerous cellular processes that rely on WASp to regulate dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton in response to signal trans - duction by a number of cell surface receptors . Here we will review the mechanisms underlying WAS with particular attention to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in WAS and WASp - deﬁcient mice . Understanding the aspects of immune system function which are disrupted in a single gene disorder such as WAS can shed light on signal transduction pathways which underlie generation of effective immune responses as well as those involved in maintain - ing immunological tolerance . 1 . Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome and the WASp protein Mutations in the WASP gene coding for the Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) were identiﬁed as the cause of most cases of WAS in 1994 [ 2 ] . WASp is a 502 amino acid protein with ﬁve functional domains : an N - terminal Drosophila - enabled / vaso - dilator - stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1 ( EVH1 ) domain , a basic region , a GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) , a polyproline - rich region ( PRR ) and a C - terminal verprolin homology / central region / acidic region ( VCA ) domain [ 3 , 4 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . The major function of WASp is to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex through its VCA domain which results in the polymerization of branched actin ﬁlaments . Regulated formation of branched actin ﬁlaments underlie forma - tion of cellular structures such as lamellopodia , and functions in cell migration , endocytosis , and vesicle trafﬁcking . Signals from cell surface receptors activate WASp through the activating the CDC42 GTPase . This GTPase binds WASP in its activated form , and induces a conformational change in WASp that activates its actin polymerizing activity . Because CDC42 can be rapidly acti - vated and inactivated by various cellular signaling pathways , this mechanism allows the tight control over actin polymerization / depolymerization necessary for rapid cellular responses . Signals acting through other domains of WASp can synergize with CDC42 binding to optimize WASp activity . Other modifying sig - nals that regulate WASp activity include Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) binding to the basic domain , WASp 0014 - 5793 / $ 36 . 00 (cid:2) 2011 Published by Elsevier B .

The type of mutation in the WASP gene strongly inﬂuences the clinical severity of Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome [ 1 , 3 ] . Premature ter - mination and deletion mutations in WASp that ablate expression of Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome protein usually result in severe , classi - cal WAS . These patients present with neonatal thrombocytopenia and dysfunctional platelets that can be accompanied by excessive bleeding , eczema , and severe infections early in life . These compli - cations can be fatal if not treated with bone marrow transplanta - tion or gene therapy . Missense mutations in the WAS gene that allow WASp protein expression with reduced function usually result in phenotypically milder cases . Some of these cases are limited to thrombocytopenia , termed X - linked thrombocytopenia ( XLT ) that can be intermittent [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] . Interestingly , activating mutations in WASp can result in a distinct clinical syndrome of severe congenital x - linked neutropenia ( XLN ) [ 7 ] . The immune deﬁciencies in WAS result from effects on a remarkably broad spectrum of cell types leading to defects in both cellular and humoral immunity . IgG levels are generally normal , but depressed IgM levels and elevated levels of IgA and IgE can oc - cur . Patients with severe WAS have reduced responses to polysac - charide antigens and class switching in response to protein antigens [ 1 ] . Lymphocyte numbers tend to be normal at birth , but then decline with age with lymphopenia below 1000 cells / mm 3 in about a quarter of patients [ 8 ] . Depressed T cell function as measured by Delayed - Type Hypersensitivity responses and mitogen - induced proliferation has been reported . In a number of retrospective case studies , 40 – 72 % of WAS patients have autoim - munity . Autoimmunity associated with WAS manifested most frequently by autoimmune hemolytic anemia , but other complica - tions such vasculitis resembling Henoch – Schönlein purpura with IgA nephropathy , uveitis and inﬂammatory bowel disease have also been reported [ 9 – 11 ] . While many thought that autoimmunity was more common in patients with complete WASp protein deﬁ - ciency , recent reports show that patients with only the mild form of X - linked thrombocytopenia have autoimmunity [ 5 ] . 2 . Cellularimmune defects in WAS and WASp deﬁciency in mice Investigation of WASp deﬁcient mice has uncovered a large number of distinct defects in immune function in multiple cell types that are similar to those seen in WAS patients ( Fig . 2 ) . WASp deﬁcient mice have thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia similar to WAS patients , but do not develop eczema , hematopoietic malig - nancies or abnormal bleeding that can be seen in WAS [ 12 , 13 ] . One colony of WASp deﬁcient mice developed spontaneous colitis [ 12 ] but in other facilities , colitis in these mice is mainly seen after irradiation or other stresses , suggesting the involvement of envi - ronmental factors . WASp deﬁcient T cells exhibit poor T cell prolif - eration after mitogen or antigen stimulation that could be rescued by addition of IL - 2 [ 14 , 15 ] . This may stem from reduced efﬁciency of immune synapse formation between T cells and APC , but WASp also appears to independently regulate the capacity of T cells to secrete effector cytokines [ 16 ] . Part of the reason WASp deﬁciency produces such varied and often mild defects is that there may be partial redundancy with other related proteins which promote actin polymerization termed type I nucleation promoting factors ( NPF ) , including N - WASp , WAVE , WASH , WHAMM , and JMY proteins . Unlike WASp , whose expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells , N - WASp is ubiqui - tously expressed in all cells and , N - WASp deﬁciency results in defective endocytosis , exocytosis , and hair - follicle cycling [ 17 ] . WASH mediates endosome trafﬁcking , but functions at different times and in different vesicles than N - WASp . WAVE proteins medi - ate cell motility and membrane rufﬂing , WHAMM mediates ER - Golgi transport and Golgi organization , and JMY mediates cell motility [ 18 ] . Although N - WASp deﬁciency is lethal in mice , the redundancy of N - WASp and WASp in lymphocytes was investi - gated by creating mice which WASp , N - WASp , or both proteins were ablated speciﬁcally in T cells or in the lymphocytes of chime - ras with RAG deﬁcient blastocysts [ 19 ] . Remarkably , no defects were seen in cells deﬁcient only in N - WASp , indicating that N - WASp may be redundant for many of functions of lymphocytes that are affected by WASp . However when B and T cells were dou - bly deﬁcient in WASp and N - WASp , lymphopenia and a block in thymic development prior to the CD4 + CD8 + double positive T cell stage was seen . Thymocytes from these mice displayed reduced proliferation and chemotactic responses to CCL12 , a critical chemo - kine positioning cells within the thymus [ 19 ] . Of note , colitis in WASp / N - WASp doubly - deﬁcient mice was more severe than in WASp deﬁcient mice , possibly because of the lymphopenia and reduced numbers of ( Treg ) T cells present in the doubly deﬁcient mice . Expression of targeted mutations of WASp in T cells and in transgenic and knock - in mice have helped to deﬁne the functions of each domain of WASp and dissect their contribution to the clin - ical manifestations of WAS ( Fig . 1 ) . Deletion of the EVH1 domain reduces the ability of WASp to bind to WIP , which binds to and sta - bilizes WASp [ 20 ] . Since the majority of WAS point mutations in patients are at the N - terminal region of WASp , including many within the EVH1 domain , WIP binding appears necessary in vivo to stabilize WASp expression in vivo . In mice expressing WASp missing the GBD , binding of Cdc42 is ablated as would be pre - dicted , but T cells proliferate normally after activation , suggesting that WASp acts in T cell activation independently of the GBD [ 21 ] . Instead , a key role of phosphorylation of Tyrosine at position 291 in human ( 293 in mouse ) in the GBD has been uncovered [ 21 , 22 ] . Mice expressing a mutant WASp protein which cannot be phosphorylated at this position are similar to WASp deﬁcient ani - mals , suggesting that phosphorylation of this tyrosine in the GBD is required for WASp activation independently of CD42 binding . Deletion of the Proline Rich Region ( PRR ) in WASp reduces forma - tion of T cell : APC conjugates and actin polymerization suggesting that the PRR is important for TCR signaling [ 15 ] . Interestingly , dele - tion of the C terminal VCA domain in WASp results in defective thymopoiesis , which is not seen in WASp deﬁcient mice [ 23 ] , sug - gesting that WASp lacking this C - terminal domain important for Fig . 1 .

Autoimmunity in WASp deﬁciency : cellular and molecular mechanisms The study of autoimmunity in WASp deﬁcient mice may help in - form our understanding of the pathogenesis of the autoimmune manifestation in WAS patients . Other than colitis , autoimmunity in WASp deﬁcient mice had not been studied until recently . We and others have found that older WASp deﬁcient mice develop anti - nuclear and anti - dsDNA antibodies at much higher rates than isogenic controls with titers approaching those of other autoim - mune - prone mouse strains such as MRL / lpr and NZB / NZWF1 [ 24 , 25 ] . In WASp deﬁcient mice on a 129SvEv background over six months of age , we found circulating immune complexes , immune complex deposition in the kidney , and mild nephritis resembling the IgA nephropathy seen in some WAS patients [ 24 ] . Recently , anti - platelet antibodies have been found in up to 40 % of WASp deﬁcient mice accompanied by evidence of increased platelet turn - over [ 26 ] . Defective homeostasis and function of regulatory T cells ( Treg ) may account for some of the observed autoimmunity seen in WASp deﬁcient mice and WAS patients . While numbers of FoxP3 ( + ) Tregs are normal in the periphery and thymus of WASp deﬁcient mice , in bone marrow chimera experiments in mice , WASp deﬁcient Treg were out - competed by normal Treg , suggesting a cell - intrinsic role for WASp in Treg survival . WASp deﬁcient Treg proliferated poorly and failed to produce TGF - b when stimulated in vitro . These defects could not be rescued by exogenous IL - 2 [ 25 , 27 ] . WASp deﬁ - cient Treg exhibited weaker suppression of normal T cell prolifer - ation and had reduced ability to prevent colitis induced by naïve T cells transferred into immunodeﬁcient hosts . Treg from WAS pa - tients display similar abnormalities in activation and function [ 27 , 28 ] . Why Treg are particularly affected by WASp deﬁciency is not clear . Defective Treg homeostasis may stem from the depen - dency of Treg on Interleukin - 2 for survival , which may be limiting in WASp deﬁciency . Functional defects in Treg may be related to known T cell activation defects , or problems with secretion of cyto - toxic granules by WASp deﬁcient Treg . The ability of mature T cells to undergo programmed cell death when restimulated through the TCR is also disrupted by WASp deﬁciency and this may contribute to autoimmunity in WAS inde - pendently of defects in Treg . Restimulation of activated T cells through the TCR results in programmed cell death , mediated in large part by autocrine stimulation of the TNF - family receptor Fas by Fas Ligand ( FasL ) [ 29 ] . Humans and mice with genetic de - fects in cell death induced by restimulation with antigen ( Restim - ulation - Induced Cell Death , or RICD ) , including those with defects in Fas or Fas Ligand , produce autoantibodies and suffer from auto - antibody mediated disease similar to the complications of WAS [ 30 ] . Activated WASp deﬁcient T cells underwent signiﬁcantly re - duced RICD compared to isogenic control cells . This occurred in T cells from young mice even before the onset of autoantibody pro - duction , suggesting that the TCR - induced apoptosis defect is an intrinsic property of WASp deﬁcient cells [ 24 ] . Rather than stemming from a cell intrinsic defect in Fas signal - ing , the mechanism of resistance to RICD in WASp deﬁciency ap - pears to be related to production of Fas Ligand . WASp deﬁcient T cells underwent normal programmed cell death when exposed to exogenous FasL , but produced signiﬁcantly less FasL compared to wild - type cells . FasL , like all other TNF family cytokines , is pro - duced initially as a type II transmembrane protein . FasL can be cleaved off the cell membrane by ADAM family metalloproteases to produce soluble FasL [ 31 ] , or secreted in a high - molecular weight form believed to be derived from secretion of FasL anchored in exosome - like secretory vesicles [ 31 ] . Fas - dependent apoptosis is highly dependent on the oligomerization state of FasL , only mem - brane - bound and vesicular FasL can induce apoptosis , whereas sol - uble FasL does not , and can indeed antagonize apoptosis induced by membrane - bound FasL . Reinforcing this dichotomy , mice in which only soluble FasL are produced develop systemic autoimmu - nity as severe as that in FasL deﬁcient mice [ 32 ] . Further analysis of FasL secretion in WASp deﬁcient cells revealed normal surface FasL , but reduced amounts of secreted FasL , both in soluble and high - molecular weight form .

Immuneprocessesinﬂuenced byWASpare numberedinthe ﬁgure withgreen numbers denoting effects of WASp that enhance immune responses and red denoting effects of WASp which regulate immune responses . Speciﬁc functions of WASp are numbered as follows : ( 1 ) WASp promotes dendritic cell ( DC ) podosome formation and migration [ 40 ] , presentation of particulate antigens [ 41 ] and T - DC contacts in the immune synapse in a DC intrinsic manner [ 42 , 43 ] ( 2 ) WASp in T cells can enhance the efﬁciency of immune synapse formation which contributes to T cell activation [ 14 , 15 ] ( 3 ) WASp also promotes cytokine secretion which also contributes to T cell activation and effector function [ 16 ] ( 4 ) WASp promotes restimulation - induced cell death and release of cytotoxic granules and FasL [ 24 ] . ( 5 ) WASp promotes B cell adhesion , migration , and germinal center formation [ 33 ] ( 6 ) WASp promotes T reg homeostasis , Treg control of effector T cell proliferation and Treg killing of B cells [ 25 , 28 , 35 ] . ( 7 ) WASp promotes cytotoxicity of NK cells [ 37 ] ( 8 ) WASp may also promote uptake of apoptotic blebs by macrophages [ 44 ] , although we have not reproduced this defect in WASp deﬁcient macrophages [ 24 ] . 3712 S . Y . Cleland , R . M . Siegel / FEBS Letters 585 ( 2011 ) 3710 – 3714 WASp deﬁcient T cells which had reduced cytotoxicity when ap - plied to bystander Fas - sensitive tumor cells . Restimulated CD4 + T cells also released less beta - hexosaminadase , suggesting a more generalized defect in granule secretion in WASp deﬁcient T cells restimulated CD4 + T cells [ 24 ] . Why WASp deﬁcient T cells pro - duce less functional FasL is less clear , WASp - dependent cytoskele - tal remodeling may be necessary for efﬁcient secretion of FasL and potentially other molecules , or a step in TCR signaling important in generating secreted vesicular FasL may depend on WASp . Taken to - gether the data on defective RICD and FasL secretion in WASp deﬁ - ciency provide a striking example of how a similar cell biological defect in secretion of granule associated proteins can promote immunodeﬁciency , through reduced secretion of effector cyto - kines , and autoimmunity , through reduced secretion of negative immune modulators such as FasL . This paradigm may apply to other mutations affecting affect both positive and regulatory as - pects of immunity . Immune deﬁciency and autoantibody production in WASp deﬁ - ciency likely has a B cell intrinsic component as well . WASp deﬁ - cient mice have reduced germinal center formation and B cell migration and proliferation defects [ 33 ] . In bone - marrow chimeras , WASp deﬁciency impairs mature B cell survival and homeostasis in a B cell intrinsic fashion [ 34 ] . Wasp deﬁcient mouse Treg are also defective in killing of activated B cells , suggesting that autoantibod - ies in WAS may arise because of failure to eliminate potentially autoreactive B cells [ 35 ] . Cell - intrinsic defects in neutrophils , den - dritic cells , NK cells and other cell types in the innate immune sys - tem have also been reported in WAS patients or WASp deﬁcient mice . [ 36 , 37 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . Collectively , these defects likely account for the complex immune dysfunction seen in patients with WAS and WASp deﬁcient mice . Perhaps because of the redundancy of WASp with other mem - bers of the NBD family of proteins regulating branched actin chain formation , the defects in WASp deﬁciency tend to be partial , rather than absolute , but the number of cell types affected may lead to the high penetrance of immunodeﬁciency and autoimmunity in all but those with the mildest molecular lesions in the WASP gene . Defects in both positive and negative regulation of immune responses in WAS lead to a situation of immune dysregulation akin to taking ones feet off both the accelerator and the brake while driving , with consequences for loss of control of immune responses . Because of the pleiotropic effects of WASp on immune function , WAS resem - bles complex autoimmune and immunodeﬁciency diseases that stem from the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors . As such , the study of WAS and WASp deﬁcient mice is likely to continue to yield insights into the pathogenesis of immu - nodeﬁciency and autoimmunity with implications beyond the relatively small number of patients afﬂicted with this syndrome .
